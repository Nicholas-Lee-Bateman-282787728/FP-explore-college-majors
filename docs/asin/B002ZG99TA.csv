1313615,AGEIT17HENDIS,B002ZG99TA,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Usually when I think about trains I think of my childhood (and on) love affair with that then vanishing way of getting around. Simple enough when  the local commuter train, then soon to be abandoned in the 1950s golden age of the automobile, the highway and the Howrad Johnson's (and subsequently McDonald's) pit stop night, came tooting its lonesome whistle in the high North Adamsville night. Or that same fascination held up later when I took my first baby steps on the endless search for the great blue-pink American West night and wound up a few time travelling in some desolate empty  box car pushing the Southern Pacific high desert night. And no question, even now I have very strong memories of what Tom Waits called in one of his mule variation day dreams- ""living on train smoke and dreams.""But enough of nostalgia, earned or not. For the film under review, Unstoppable,  is a very different cinematic look at the modern day train experience on the American tracks. Trains and disaster, or the threat of disaster,  are no strangers today, and have not been since the beginning of the railroads. The runaway train that stars in this film, the old 777 running highly dangerous cargo through rural Pennsylvania in this case, is just a continuation of the danger associated with tangling with the train smoke (from whatever fossil fuel used). And this saga is based on a real incident too boot.Through carelessness (and corporate speed-up policies) a railroad man makes a series of wrong decisions about how to fix a problem on his long-line freight train. And the thing takes off-ummanned. Naturally all hell breaks loose as everyone from the yard master to corporate headquarters tries to figure out how to stop the thing short of shooting it (although that thought I am sure crossed somebody's mind). No problem though because old railroad man Denzel Washington, ready to be tossed on the washed-out heap and training his ""new boy replacement,""  just happens to be on that same track coming the other way. Now once Denzel Washington is on the case, any cinematic case, from cop to Malcolm X to washed-out train engineer, one can rest easy. Sure there will be a couple of close calls, quite a few actually, in the hour and one half of the film but at the end of the day no highly explosive cargo is going to harm urban areas. No way. Now we can all go back to thinking about train smoke and dreams.",4,Of Train Smoke And Dreams,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,2407,"['Usually', 'when', 'think', 'trains', 'think', 'childhood', 'love', 'affair', 'then', 'vanishing', 'way', 'getting', 'around', 'Simple', 'enough', 'when', 'local', 'commuter', 'train', 'then', 'soon', 'be', 'abandoned', '1950s', 'golden', 'age', 'automobile', 'highway', 'Howrad', 'Johnson', 'subsequently', 'McDonald', 'pit', 'stop', 'night', 'came', 'tooting', 'lonesome', 'whistle', 'high', 'North', 'Adamsville', 'night', 'same', 'fascination', 'held', 'up', 'later', 'when', 'took', 'first', 'baby', 'steps', 'endless', 'search', 'great', 'blue-pink', 'American', 'West', 'night', 'wound', 'up', 'few', 'time', 'travelling', 'desolate', 'empty', 'box', 'car', 'pushing', 'Southern', 'Pacific', 'high', 'desert', 'night', 'question', 'even', 'now', 'have', 'very', 'strong', 'memories', 'what', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'called', 'one', 'mule', 'variation', 'day', 'dreams-', 'living', 'train', 'smoke', 'dreams', 'enough', 'nostalgia', 'earned', 'not', 'film', 'review', 'Unstoppable', 'very', 'different', 'cinematic', 'look', 'modern', 'day', 'train', 'experience', 'American', 'tracks', 'Trains', 'disaster', 'threat', 'disaster', 'are', 'strangers', 'today', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'beginning', 'railroads', 'runaway', 'train', 'film', 'old', '777', 'running', 'highly', 'dangerous', 'cargo', 'rural', 'Pennsylvania', 'case', 'just', 'continuation', 'danger', 'associated', 'tangling', 'train', 'smoke', 'fossil', 'fuel', 'used', 'saga', 'based', 'real', 'incident', 'too', 'boot.Through', 'carelessness', 'corporate', 'speed-up', 'policies', 'railroad', 'man', 'series', 'wrong', 'decisions', 'how', 'fix', 'problem', 'long-line', 'freight', 'train', 'thing', 'off-ummanned', 'Naturally', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'everyone', 'yard', 'master', 'corporate', 'headquarters', 'tries', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'stop', 'thing', 'short', 'shooting', 'thought', 'am', 'sure', 'crossed', 'somebody', 'mind', 'problem', 'old', 'railroad', 'man', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'ready', 'be', 'tossed', 'washed-out', 'heap', 'training', 'new', 'boy', 'replacement', 'just', 'be', 'same', 'track', 'coming', 'other', 'way', 'Now', 'once', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'case', 'cinematic', 'case', 'cop', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'washed-out', 'train', 'engineer', 'one', 'can', 'rest', 'easy', 'Sure', 'will', 'be', 'couple', 'close', 'calls', 'quite', 'few', 'actually', 'hour', 'one', 'half', 'film', 'end', 'day', 'highly', 'explosive', 'cargo', 'going', 'harm', 'urban', 'areas', 'way', 'Now', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'thinking', 'about', 'train', 'smoke', 'dreams']",N/A

He got outacted by Rosario Dawson (as a determined rail yard manager), Chris Pine (as a rookie engineer), and a runaway train.  The Denzel Washington here is essentially channeling the same roles that he played in movies like ""The Book of Eli"" and ""Man on Fire"" - calm, cool, aloof, taking the necessary actions only when he has to.  And in ""Unstoppable"", it comes off very dull, like you've seen it already and better, by him and some other good actors.  Dawson, Pine, and the train bail him out of this flick.The story, in and of itself, is compelling - a freight train is accidentally throttled to power in a rail yard and, without active air brakes to stop it, takes off down the line.  It's up to Pine, the rookie, and Washington, the old vet who found out not long before that day that the railroad was displacing him, to stop it before it reaches the city of Arklow, Pennsylvania (which, with over 700,000 people would be more populous than the state's real-life second city, Pittsburgh) and a sharp curve which sits near a Family Dollar and some fuel tanks that will undoubtably explode should the train run off the tracks and fall into them.  The execution, however, was lacking. The musical score constantly droned away while the action was taking place, not letting up a bit where it should've been much less ham-handed, and helicopters galore were giving chase at ridiculously low altitudes in order to get a good story.""Unstoppable"" is not a movie on the order of some other notable train movies, like ""The Cassandra Crossing"" or ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"" (the Walter Matthau/Robert Shaw version).  Heck, it doesn't even have the camp value of the made-for-TV disaster drama ""Atomic Train"".  And it could've been much better than it was.

In the film version of the story, an unmanned train wreaks havoc as it gains speed and becomes uncontrollable.

The pair, oddly mixed yet more similar than expected, take on the treacherous task of manually stopping the train.  Thanks to the chemistry between Chris Pine and Denzel Washington, `Unstoppable' maintains our attention, and deservedly so.  The plot at times seems farfetched, and the action can seem over the top and yet it all works thanks to some spitfire editing and sharp direction from Tony Scott, the lesser (yet the vastly underrated) of the two Scott brothers.  With nicely shot cinematography, expertly used visual effects and an effective score, `Unstoppable' is a lot more fun and thrilling and memorable than one may expect.  The rather unexpected heaps of praise the film received were certainly justified.

The movie is directed by Tony Scott, written by Mark Bomback, and stars actors Denzel Washington and Chris pine.  Denzel Washington, who plays Frank in the movie truly plays his part as a responsible veteran train conductor.  The acting he portrays accurately presents his emotions at each moment in time.  For instance, when he is basically engaging on a suicide mission, he both shows his fear, but also his audacious character.  Chris Pine who plays Will, is able to show his growth in maturity and responsibility throughout the 2 hour movie.  At first he shows that all he cares about is his recent divorce, but as the situation occurs he gets his priorities straight and acts as a responsible co-conductor.  A unique acting skill Chris has is that he is able to precisely show his excruciating physical pain, incorporating peculiar movements and verbal signs of his pain.Unstoppable, was a phenomenal movie, consisting both of epic scenes and drama.  Throughout the whole movie, the watcher is left in suspense, predicting what is going to happen at each moment, but always surprised with the outcome, for the movies is just that unpredictable.  The movie is capable of keeping an audience on their toes throughout the entire movie, whether it is between a near death situations, or of what step to take next in bringing the train to a halt, in order to prevent the unmanned train from contaminating a city with its toxic content. The visual affects presented in the movie are extraordinary and I highly recommend seeing the movie in I-Max, for it will immensely enhance the movie.  The movie consists of several epic explosion scenes.  For instance, there is a point in time when a diesel engine attempts to slow down and eventually stop the train by getting in front of the train and putting initiating its brakes.  Unfortunately, this plan proves to be unsuccessful, for the unmanned train devours the diesel engine, causing it to explode and kill the conductor.The very end of the movie is predictable, but not in a disappointing way, for the events leading up to the end are not.  When you finally see the end result, you almost feel relieved, because everything ended up turning out fine, following all the other unsuccessful attempts.  There was a particular scene in the movie which consisted of drama, propelled action and suspense.  In this scene Will is jumping from box car to box car, anticipating to reach the front of the train. As this is happening the train is at a speed of over 60 mph and at each box car, he has to manually initiate the brakes.  There are also helicopters and other vehicles traveling nearby.  The age recommendation truly fits the movie, for there are several scenes incorporated into the movie, which have the potential to scare children 12 and under.

It's THAT good!I'm still pretty darn amazed just how much I enjoyed Unstoppable while watching it this afternoon.  I *almost* passed it up too, believing it couldn't be anywhere as good as the description says.  I was totally wrong!It's exactly what you've been reading about- a train goes out of the control when the driver makes a silly, critical mistake and is forced to jump off the train to correct the problem (while the train is in motion).Of course he's so out of shape he's unable to get back on the train before it takes off on its own and eventually builds up enough speed to become a serious threat to major populated areas.  Not only that, but the train is carrying dangerous chemicals that threaten the safety of innocent people all over town.Throughout the film many people try to stop the train but everyone fails hard and heavy.  I'm surprised how much detail was involved pertaining to train knowledge.  The movie writers must have brought in some professionals to make everything seem so believable.Overall, the action is beyond amazing and continuous, the acting is really intense and defines edge of your seat suspense the way it involves a rookie train driver clashing with the professionals and attempting to make a point that even a rookie can get the job done, and it's just a really spectacular movie overall.

1313635,A30TQET02FLSUX,B002ZG99TA,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[0, 0]","FILM RATING:  2.5 starsUnstoppable (2010) is director Tony Scott's latest attempt at creating another engaging, smart, techie, action/thriller/drama movie like Top Gun (1986), Days Of Thunder (1990), Crimson Tide (1995), Enemy of the State (1998), and Deja Vu (2006). Unfortunately, Scott doesn't quite get there with this one. While Unstoppable isn't quite unwatchable, it's probably not all that re-watchable. Once you've seen it, there's little to go back for. Even at 98 minutes, the movie dragged on for me. Scott has all of the technical cinematic ingredients, as he always seems to have in his movies. But once again, after failed attempts with The Taking Of Pelham 1-2-3 (2009) and Spy Game (2001), Scott just didn't have a really good story and script to work from. At least that's my excuse for him. I know he can put together incredible movies like the five I listed above, all of which are favorites of mine. But like every great movie, it all starts with the script, and screenwriter Mark Bomback just didn't come through here. It's not a bad story. It's even written well in terms of dialogue. But there's just no emotional core to the characters. They're very one-dimensional...and even the great Denzel Washington can't get his character Frank into my psyche or my heart like so many of his other great characters.Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson give solid performances and round out a solid cast. But they seem to have nothing really to act for. A runaway train with no one at the helm just doesn't make for much of an engaging plot here. I kept wishing Dennis Hopper would show up and give this Speed (1994) wannabe a bad guy that I could hate. I kept thinking that Unstoppable was basically a remake of Speed with a train instead of a bus. And haven't we had enough Speed remakes already? And to be honest, didn't Scott just work with Denzel Washington and trains in The Taking Of Pelham 1-2-3...the year before? Hopefully Scott finds his way back to a good script soon because I definitely love his style of filmmaking when paired with good material.On the positive side, Unstoppable looks and sounds absolutely spectacular on blu-ray, which is the format I saw it in this week. As always, Scott brings on board a great director of photography (Ben Seresin) who provides simply awesome cinematography. When it comes to shooting planes, trains, and automobiles...and submarines, motorcycles, helicopters and any other possible moving piece of machinery, director Tony Scott is about as good as it gets. I'm sure the coordination necessary to bring all of these various moving metal objects together into one camera frame requires a whole team of assistant directors, producers, and various crew. But it's those scenes, when all of these various moving metal objects are actually moving around with each other, that kept me involved in the movie. The multiple helicopters, trains, and automobiles are just incredible to see together.No one seems to bring all of the technical action and stunts together in the editing room like Scott. Of course credit should be given to film editors Robert Duffy and Chris Lebenzon, who did a good job keeping the film moving along with their final cut. But Scott's filmmaking style is definitely stamped on the cut as well.  Reinforcing the incredible action in this film is top notch sound design and editing by sound supervisor Mark P. Stoeckinger, with his accompanying 28 other sound department crew members. Unstoppable was nominated for the Best Sound Editing Oscar last year, and you can definitely hear why when watching this film! Rounding out the technical praise for Unstoppable, is good production design by Chris Seagers and his enormous team. Every little detail shines through in the sets, locations and with all of the trains, cars, and helicopters. The textures, colors, and materials used throughout the film give it a modern feel that works nicely on film.I was a bit torn between giving Unstoppable 3 stars or 2.5 stars, but I settled on 2.5 because I think the likelihood of me watching this movie again anytime soon is really slim. There's just nothing in the story to go back to. No emotion to feel again. No thoughts to think again. No riddles to unravel. And no character tension to try and release. Unstoppable is a first class production, as director Tony Scott is well known for. But in the annals of filmdom, Unstoppable didn't make much of a mark.

1313653,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG99TA,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 6]","Tony Scott's ""Unstoppable"" is a nail biting, heart pounding, relentlessly exciting film. It takes most of the reliable hallmarks of the action picture - death defying stunts, crashes, explosions - and strips them to the bare essentials. There's no posturing, no big muscles and machine guns, no pompous dialogue, no padding of any kind. There's only a raw, primal adrenaline rush. The result is a film so taut and gripping that you're liable to lose the feeling in your hands from clenching the armrests on your theater's chair. It winds itself up at the start and keeps on winding until the spring is ready to break loose; at the end of it all, when the tension is finally released, you will breathe a sigh of relief ... and then want to experience it all over again. It's kind of like riding a roller coaster.This film represents a purer, healthier attitude towards the action film. It's great entertainment, yes, but it also has both a brain and a heart at work. Rather than assault us with bursts of noise and flashes of light, we're pushed into a genuinely frightening scenario and dragged along with nothing but the hope that it will somehow turn out all right. We're actually made to feel something. Better still, we're made to care about the characters, who aren't disposable war-mongering typecasts but ordinary people thrust into an extraordinary situation. If convention dictates that the key players will become heroes, at least I can take comfort in knowing that this time around, they actually earn that distinction. And no, I don't care that the film is in all likelihood a gross exaggeration of real life events - I wanted to be thrilled, and thrilled I was.""Unstoppable"" stars Denzel Washington and Chris Pine as a pair of railroad workers. The former is Frank Barnes, a long time engineer for the Allegheny and West Virginia Railroad. The latter is Will Colson, a rookie conductor. They hit it off like oil and water, Frank and his co-workers believing that Will was hired strictly because of family connections to the union. Despite their differences, they're assigned to work a locomotive together. Frank makes it clear, perhaps a little too strenuously, that Will should ask about something if he doesn't know what to do. Will's personal problems continuously distract him throughout the day; he takes calls he shouldn't be taking, and eventually, he attaches their locomotive to too many trains. Things just don't seem to be going well.And it will only get worse. At another station, a lazy hostler (Ethan Suplee) fails to connect an air hose on a train that's scheduled to be moved, preventing the air brakes from working. He doesn't think this will be a problem; he'll simply hook them up after parking the train on another track. Unfortunately, the switch up ahead is not set for the right track, and when he jumps off the main engine to fix it - a highly frowned upon maneuver - the improperly set throttle shifts on its own, speeding up the train to the point that he can no longer get back on. Not only is the train unmanned, it's now on the coasting faster and faster along mainline. Will and Frank are also on the mainline. And they're going in the opposite direction.Keeping tabs on the escalating situation is yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson), who quickly learns that the some of the tanks on the runaway train are carrying a highly hazardous material. She and a number of other dispatchers work tirelessly to get all opposing traffic onto sidings, and this includes a train full of children on a field trip. They begin rallying the state police in the hopes that they can secure guard crossings in various cities. Connie also has to fight an uphill battle with her superior, Oscar Galvin (Kevin Dunn), a corporate typecast unwilling to entertain her idea of derailing the train in lightly populated farmland. Derailing the train would cost the company millions of dollars, and as we all know, money is more important than safety.I will now refrain from going into detail, since that would ruin the suspense. I will only say that Frank and Will get wind of the situation and decide to stop the runaway train on their own. I will also say that, from here, the film becomes increasingly nerve wracking. Many action movies are about as predictable as a Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland backyard musical; with ""Unstoppable,"" there's no telling where it might go. The uncertainty, the sheer anticipation, is so palpable that you may lose your breath from gasping so much.Action films made as well as ""Unstoppable"" have to be treasured, for they show that some filmmakers want to do more than merely exhilarate the audience; they also want to prove that even films about runaway trains can be smart, stylish, and powerful. Watching this film, it's obvious that serious thought went into the plot and the characters. Serious thought must have gone into casting as well, for everyone involved lends believable, engaging performances. Rosario Dawson in particular is especially good, giving her character just the right balance of professional backbone and personal concern. But most of the credit must be given to Mark Bomback for his convincing screenplay, Chris Lebenzon and Robert Duffy for their editing, and everyone who contributed to stunt work, special effects, and sound. They remembered what an action film is supposed to be.",4,Terror Train,1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,5362,"['Tony', 'Scott', 'Unstoppable', 'nail', 'biting', 'heart', 'pounding', 'relentlessly',

Miller, Ethan Suplee and Kevinn CorriganWRITTEN BY: Mark BombackDIRECTED BY: Tony ScottRated: PG - 13Genre: Action / ThrillerRelease Date: 12 November 2010Review Date: 09 November 2010Unstoppable is the perfect title for a Denzel Washington flick because that is exactly what he is. He simply doesn't make bad movies and his performances are always riveting and dead-on. And if you were to surround him with the talents of Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson, you really couldn't go wrong.Director Tony Scott has done just that with Unstoppable, marking it as his impressive 16th feature film and fifth collaboration with Denzel. From Top Gun and Days of Thunder to Beverly Hills Cop II and The Taking of Pelham 123, who better to direct an action picture based on true events of a runaway train carrying tons of deadly chemicals, than Tony Scott?That's the plot and you know the actors so let's meet the characters. Denzel plays Frank; a single father to two teenage daughters working their way through college by waiting tables at Hooters. Don't trouble yourself; Denzel makes the joke for you. I'm just curious if Hooters paid Fox or if Fox paid Hooters? Frank has been working in a rail yard for 28 years and today he's got a new partner.Chris Pine plays Will - said partner, and the two don't hit it off so well at first. Frank is old school and Will is new school and there's no teacher around to make sure they play nice. It's just them and us in the cockpit of their train for the majority of their screen time. Don't think we spend the entire film stuck in a conductor box with these two though because we don't; they're not on the runaway train by the way.The train has runaway (is it just me or does the term runaway train just sound funny?) due to the incompetence of two idiots played by two funny and good actors whom I'll save for you. Their boss Connie, played by the lovely Rosario Dawson, must clean up their mess, serving as mediator between them, other employees, Frank and Will, an inspector, and her stiff corporate A-hole of a supervisor, Galvin (Kevin Dunn).Galvin is more concerned with the potential financial tragedy of a `train wreck' as the beast is half a mile long (a lot of money folks), than he is with the moral dilemma of how many lives will be lost should a wreck occur. The train has to go somewhere and it's headed straight for a big town; of course. Frank, Will and Connie aren't having it though because they're the good guys after all; so they devise a plan to earn that title.Unstoppable is about a train on the loose - but it's good, fast, funny and fun.",4,Unstoppable Review,1289347200,"11 10, 2010",2010,2676,"['UNSTOPPABLESTARRING', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'T.J.', 'Miller', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'Kevinn', 'CorriganWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Mark', 'BombackDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Tony', 'ScottRated', 'PG', '13Genre', 'Action', 'ThrillerRelease', 'Date', '12', 'November', '2010Review', 'Date', '09', 'November', '2010Unstoppable', 'perfect', 'title', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'flick', 'exactly', 'what', 'simply', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'movies', 'performances', 'are', 'always', 'riveting', 'dead-on', 'were', 'surround', 'talents', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong.Director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'done', 'just', 'Unstoppable', 'marking', 'impressive', '16th', 'feature', 'film', 'fifth', 'collaboration', 'Denzel', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'II', 'Taking', 'Pelham', '123', 'who', 'better', 'direct', 'action', 'picture', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'runaway', 'train', 'carrying', 'tons', 'deadly', 'chemicals', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'plot', 'know', 'actors', 'let', 'meet', 'characters', 'Denzel', 'Frank', 'single', 'father', 'two', 'teenage', 'daughters', 'working', 'way', 'college', 'waiting', 'tables', 'Hooters', 'Do', ""n't"", 'trouble', 'Denzel', 'joke', ""'m"", 'just', 'curious', 'Hooters', 'paid', 'Fox', 'Fox', 'paid', 'Hooters', 'Frank', 'been', 'working', 'rail', 'yard', '28', 'years', 'today', 'got', 'new', 'partner.Chris', 'Pine', 'plays', 'Will', 'said', 'partner', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'hit', 'off', 'so', 'well', 'first', 'Frank', 'old', 'school', 'Will', 'new', 'school', 'teacher', 'around', 'make', 'sure', 'play', 'nice', 'just', 'cockpit', 'train', 'majority', 'screen', 'time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'spend', 'entire', 'film', 'stuck', 'conductor', 'box', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'not', 'runaway', 'train', 'way.The', 'train', 'runaway', 'just', 'term', 'runaway', 'train', 'just', 'sound', 'funny', 'due', 'incompetence', 'two', 'idiots', 'played', 'two', 'funny', 'good', 'actors', 'whom', ""'ll"", 'save', 'boss', 'Connie', 'played', 'lovely', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'must', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'serving', 'mediator', 'other', 'employees', 'Frank', 'Will', 'inspector', 'stiff', 'corporate', 'A-hole', 'supervisor', 'Galvin', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', '.Galvin', 'more', 'concerned', 'potential', 'financial', 'tragedy', 'train', 'wreck', 'beast', 'mile', 'long', 'lot', 'money', 'folks', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'how', 'many', 'lives', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'should', 'wreck', 'occur', 'train', 'go', 'somewhere', 'headed', 'straight', 'big', 'town', 'course', 'Frank', 'Will', 'Connie', 'are', ""n't"", 'having', ""'re"", 'good', 'guys', 'devise', 'plan', 'earn', 'title.Unstoppable', 'train', 'loose', 'good', 'fast', 'funny', 'fun']",N/A
1313660,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG99TA,C. Sawin,"[11, 18]","Remember Speed from 1994? It was that action film that everyone seemed to love during the nineties and for good reason; it had high octane action, a great cast, and it managed to just keep going even when you thought it was going to end like ten minutes prior. Now get rid of the bus and replace it with an out of control train carrying explosive chemicals. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are now Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, which means Joe Morton is now Rosario Dawson and Dennis Hopper is Kevin Dunn...or something. Anyway, the point is, Unstoppable in a nutshell is basically Speed on a train.The first thing that comes to mind with Unstoppable is how incredibly LOUD it is. It seemed like the knob to the volume was broken off after it was turned past its limitations during the sound editing process. If you aren't listening to an out of control train squealing on railroad tracks, it's the soundtrack full of heavy guitar riffs that rumbles the floor under your seat. The other kind of bizarre thing was the weird zoom-in Unstoppable used in the first half of the film. We'd open on a shot of actors talking, but then the camera would zoom-in slightly sometimes more than once. It was probably used to try and add suspense to whatever the actors were talking about at the time, but it came off as irritating more than anything. Thankfully, it wasn't done the entire film. I seem to remember it happening during another recent film that I can't put my finger on, but it's more than likely another Tony Scott film.In a film like this, acting is kind of secondary. As long as they're reacting to whatever threat is currently posed against them in a way that seems realistic, then it's safe to say that they've done their job well. This isn't the best work of any of the actors involved. Denzel Washington definitely shined brighter in both Man on Fire (another Tony Scott film) and The Book of Eli from earlier this year and Chris Pine hasn't really done anything as impressive as his portrayal of Captain James Kirk in last year's Star Trek. Then there's Rosario Dawson whose role as Connie seems kind of safe for the actress as it seems way too similiar to most of the other roles in her repertoire. The thing is though that it all works out in the end to deliver a film that is both thrilling and exciting. People go to the movies to be entertained and this film does that very well. The one problem with Unstoppable is that it doesn't seem to give any weight to the several emotional factors of the film. We know just enough to realize both Frank and Will will lose a lot if they fail at trying to stop this train and while it does work, I can't help but feel like the film would have had an even bigger impact if we had spent a little more time getting to know Frank's daughters or having a little more depth to Will's situation with his wife and son.Unstoppable is a white knuckled, edge of your seat thriller that has a way of making you feel like you're thrown in front of the railroad tracks as this unstoppable train approaches during the most suspenseful and knuckle biting scenes. The thriller is very similar to what Speed would be like today if it took place on a train, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Unstoppable is definitely an exciting way to waste an hour and a half.",3,Suspenseful and thrilling,1289520000,"11 12, 2010",2010,3305,"['Remember', 'Speed', '1994', 'was', 'action', 'film', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'love', 'nineties', 'good', 'reason', 'had', 'high', 'octane', 'action', 'great', 'cast', 'managed', 'just', 'keep', 'going', 'even', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'ten', 'minutes', 'prior', 'Now', 'get', 'rid', 'bus', 'replace', 'control', 'train', 'carrying', 'explosive', 'chemicals', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'are', 'now', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Joe', 'Morton', 'now', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'something', 'Anyway', 'point', 'Unstoppable', 'nutshell', 'basically', 'Speed', 'train.The', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'Unstoppable', 'how', 'incredibly', 'LOUD', 'seemed', 'knob', 'volume', 'was', 'broken', 'off', 'was', 'turned', 'limitations', 'sound', 'editing', 'process', 'are', ""n't"", 'listening', 'control', 'train', 'squealing', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'soundtrack', 'full', 'heavy', 'guitar', 'riffs', 'floor', 'seat', 'other', 'kind', 'bizarre', 'thing', 'was', 'weird', 'zoom-in', 'Unstoppable', 'used', 'first', 'half', 'film', ""'d"", 'open', 'shot', 'actors', 'talking', 'then', 'camera', 'would', 'zoom-in', 'slightly', 'sometimes', 'more', 'once', 'was', 'probably', 'used', 'try', 'add', 'suspense', 'whatever', 'actors', 'were', 'talking', 'about', 'time', 'came', 'off', 'irritating', 'more', 'anything', 'Thankfully', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'entire', 'film', 'seem', 'remember', 'happening', 'recent', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'more', 'likely', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'film.In', 'film', 'acting', 'kind', 'secondary', 'As', 'long', ""'re"", 'reacting', 'whatever', 'threat', 'currently', 'posed', 'way', 'realistic', 'then', 'safe', 'say', ""'ve"", 'done', 'job', 'well', ""n't"", 'best', 'work', 'actors', 'involved', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'definitely', 'shined', 'brighter', 'Man', 'Fire', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'film', 'Book', 'Eli', 'earlier', 'year', 'Chris', 'Pine', ""n't"", 'really', 'done', 'anything', 'as', 'impressive', 'portrayal', 'Captain', 'James', 'Kirk', 'last', 'year', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Then', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'role', 'Connie', 'kind', 'safe', 'actress', 'way', 'too', 'similiar', 'most', 'other', 'roles', 'repertoire', 'thing', 'out', 'end', 'deliver', 'film', 'thrilling', 'exciting', 'People', 'go', 'movies', 'be', 'entertained', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'problem', 'Unstoppable', ""n't"", 'seem', 'give', 'weight', 'several', 'emotional', 'factors', 'film', 'know', 'just', 'enough', 'realize', 'Frank', 'Will', 'will', 'lose', 'lot', 'fail', 'trying', 'stop', 'train', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'even', 'bigger', 'impact', 'had', 'spent', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'getting', 'know', 'Frank', 'daughters', 'having', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'Will', 'situation', 'wife', 'son.Unstoppable', 'white', 'knuckled', 'edge', 'seat', 'thriller', 'way', 'making', 'feel', ""'re"", 'thrown', 'front', 'railroad', 'unstoppable', 'train', 'approaches', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'knuckle', 'biting', 'scenes', 'thriller', 'very', 'similar', 'what', 'Speed', 'would', 'be', 'today', 'took', 'place', 'train', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Unstoppable', 'definitely', 'exciting', 'way', 'waste', 'hour', 'half']",N/A

1313670,AOS5ZBTQX7QIT,B002ZG99TA,D. Barbour,"[2, 6]","Unstoppable is kind of like a sports movie. If you've seen the ads, you know it's about a runaway train and two men who chase after it. You know the movie can only end one of two ways - either the men stop the train and all is well, or the train derails and devastates. So for just over an hour and a half, this movie needs to keep our attention despite the ending being completely predictable. The cast is led by Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, with Rosario Dawson also turning in a nice supporting performance. These cast members are really playing second fiddle to the train though, as that's what we all really want to see.The movie is loosely based on a true story, but you quickly can tell how loosely by all of the ""close calls"" the train has with hitting stuff. There is a group of students on a train headed towards the runaway train. There are a couple of nervous horses on the tracks. These instances were a little cheap and unrealistic. It's not to say that there wouldn't be close calls in this type of situation, but the overacting of those involved in these situations was silly. Also, some of the instances aren't resolved on screen, just in a passing comment like ""Oh, that van was moved by the way."" My other problem has to do with the ending. I won't spoil it, but let's just say if you really think about it, it's kind of unrealistic.On the plus side, despite being predictable and silly at times, the movie isn't slow. They quickly tell the story and then end the movie - there isn't a single wasted minute. I was on the edge of my seat almost the entire time. It's very entertaining, and it is quite fun.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","The brothers Scott are among the best moviemakers in the business; Ridley and Tony know how to tell a story via stunning visuals and heart-pounding action.  In UNSTOPPABLE Tony puts on the proverbial throttle from virtually the beginning of the film and doesn't even think about pulling it back; the result is nonstop mayhem, violence, and destruction that very much makes the film's $100 million budget not surprising.  Tony gets to tear up a lot of. . .stuff. . .in UNSTOPPABLE, a movie about a doofus who leaves his moving train to personally throw a switch--only the train gets away from him.  And speeds up; we're talking 70 mph speeds as it races through rural Pennsylvania on its way to a fictionalized metro (Stanton?), where certain derailment awaits--and of course the train is pulling several tankards of highly toxic chemicals.Yep.  That's why I took my heart pills as I was watching this puppy.While the railroad's execs dither on what to do another locomotive is in the area, operated by a crafty veteran engineer (Denzel Washington) and his wet-behind-the-ears conductor (Chris Pine).  When they're not snapping at one another Denzel's character is waxing philosophical while Pine's character is trying to smooth over a restraining order filed by his wife.  Ignoring the orders of the execs--who have decided to derail the train before it reaches the city--the rogue team pursues the train--in reverse--in an effort to connect to the runaway train's last car; then, they theorize, they'll put on the brakes to slow the runaway down.  Naturally, Scott really ratchets up the action here, and UNSTOPPABLE hurls like a rocket towards its climactic (yet sometimes cartoon-like) ending.  And Rosario Dawson looks darn good as a railroad operations supervisor, even though all she does is basically talk into a headset.  (Lucky headset.)

Having seen it on the big screen I was simply amazed at the thrill-ride I was on for 1 hr and 38 min.  I know this movie is based on real-life events, though they were overexemplified in the movie simply because, well it was made to make money for the motion picture industry.  You have 2 morons at the beginning of the movie who look like they belong anywhere but working in a rail yard, especially Ethan Suplee who hops out of the cab of a high-power locomotive attached to a consist of 39 cars while it is in motion, even though his co-worker warns him the air hoses are not attached, rendering the air brakes useless to stop the train!!  Then you flash to a rookie conductor (Chris Pine) and a veteran engineer (Denzel Washington) whom are out on a routine day of hauling cargo.  From there on out it is non-stop action.  I have to admit that some of the scenes were rather ridiculous, if not entertaining and hold-your-breath types, such as the one where the lashup (2 locomotives connected together to haul heavier consists) driven by another veteran engineer (David Warshofsky) derails and explodes after 777 bumps it as it goes into the siding and also where the (what were they thinking?) young Afghanistan veteran is lowered from the helicopter onto the fast moving locomotive and gets knocked off when 777 hits the lashup hard.  After that it is nuts with the drama and suspense as Pine and Washington try to speed up and couple their lone locomotive to a 41-unit train with 2 much more powerful locomotives in full throttle, how did they ever think they were going to be able to stop a 70-plus mph train with one older, well-used locomotive?  Rosario Dawson did lend a very good performance in her role as yardmaster and communicating and connecting with Pine and Washington during their daring chase.I will admit I was on the edge of my seat in the theater when this was released in November and eagerly awaited the DVD release, though I have to admit it isn't quite as riveting on a TV screen as it is in a theater.  The ending was a bit of a letdown as it just simply ended and with no air brakes I don't see how Chris Pine could have braked that 75-mph train in a very short distance.  The one nice plus is he reunited with his estranged wife and child.  Guess it takes a near death tragedy to bring a couple back together...All in all, a great movie worth watching for a thrill ride.

And I don't care as much if someone likes or doesn't like a particular film as much as I care why they like or don't like it. You can't put a film like ""Independence Day"" in the same category as ""The Seven Samurai"" but that doesn't keep me from viewing either repeatedly. Each film needs to know what it's looking to do and each needs to succeed in its own right.Tony Scott is a seasoned director. He usually exercises great authority over his projects and ""Unstoppable"" is no exception. This is just a way cool flick that will keep you on the edge of your seat for most of it. A runaway train, loaded with toxic goo and explosive goo, is barreling down the tracks and it's going to make an awful mess of things unless our heroes save the day.I never thought much one way or the other about what goes on in a train yard. This gave me a real eye opener on that count. I got to know about trains, routing, switching, union politics and a lot more. The viewer gets a good sense about how involved it all is. It's set in Southern Pennsylvania in late autumn. Again, Scott does a good job of giving the viewer a sense of people and place. You feel like you're there.The characters are good. The action is relieved by scenes of the two leads getting buddy buddy with each other, so you have a reason to care about them. Rosario Dawson is always a treat for the eyes and she has a good roll here. A note on this. The main three actors all need to do their thing in very confined spaces. Washington and Pine are in the locomotive for most of the movie and Dawson is in her office. These actors have to deliver most of their lines sitting down. If that's not a testament to their abilities I don't know what is.The action is good and it's smart. The writers did their due diligence on the tech stuff so the viewer gets the whys and wherefores on the gravity of the situation. There is a logical progression to the things that happen. And as they unfold I found myself getting more and more involved. It draws you in and doesn't let go.Is this the best movie ever made? No. But it delivers the goods in spades. If you're at all disposed toward this sort of thing, spend your money at the box office.

I also have a soft spot for Nathan Suplee from his days on My Name Is Earl. I've worked in the industrial realm and can see something like this happening. Mr. Scott weaves a story that makes it just plausible enough that it could actually happen and since it was inspired by true events, well... Whatever plot holes and flaws in logic there may be if you look too close, I never noticed. I was enjoying myself too much.The movie starts slowly, at least to me it does, but that is kind of the point. It needs to build up to the real frantic climax. As things unfold, we learn bits and pieces about some of the characters, mainly Denzel and Chris's. One is on the verge of forced retirement while the other is on his umpteenth job. As the movie unfolds and things get dicey, they inevitably come to like and respect each other. Predictable, but so what? It still makes for a great and fun ride.The magnificent machines are big stars in this movie also. Those trains are powerful and almost unstoppable beasts and they take a lot of finesse to tame, despite what most people might think. I have a lot of respect for the real train engineers. I'm sure many of them have cringed at some of the scenes in this movie, but I didn't see their image really tarnished except by Nathan Suplee's screw-up which was the whole reason for the movie. Then again, as I said earlier, this has happened before and it's likely to happen again somewhere.I should also mention Rosario Dawson and Lew Temple as supporting characters.

1313704,A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE,B002ZG99TA,G. Max Gooding,"[2, 3]","Overview:Managing freight trains is really an exercise in logistics. The objective is to get goods from point A to point B as quickly and safely as possible. Along the route there may be different switches and changeovers that may be encountered. Computers play a major role in the scheduling of trains in order to optimize the use of the rails. Over land, in terms of ton-miles hauled per unit of consumed energy, rail transport is more efficient than other means of transportation.This film is about a half-mile long freight train that was allowed to run away without its engineer, who was just a bit too careless and too slow. Initially it was thought that it was a 'coaster' - just rolling, but not under power, so they tried an initial interception down the track. But to their surprise, the train as long gone and now moving at a speed approaching 70 miles per hour. To make matters worse, the train has a huge amount of diesel fuel that it is carrying to keep it running, and if that is not bad enough, several of the cars contain explosive, toxic chemicals that are used to make glue.The Heroes:The guys who will take on the last effort ot stop this train are:- Frank (Denzil Washington) a veteran engineer with 18 years experience.- Will (Chris Pine) a rookie now getting some hands-on training.There is a little animosity between the two initally, as Frank, sees himself as the old hand that is being phased out, and replaced by an inexperienced novice, with only theoretical training. However, when the crisis arises, they set aside their differences and rise to the challenge.The Experience:Watching this movie is a riveting experience. The momentum (mass x velocity) of the trains come across the screen big time. There are close passes and near misses that can make you sweat just watching them. There is a lot of stunt work especially at the ending. You can really get into this movie as the tension continues to build. The end is indeed quite rewarding, and you know that you have been taken to the edge and back again.Conclusion:What I like about this movie is the way that it captures the determination and resolve of the human spirit, to risk everything for the safety of others.",4,Terrific Train Thriller,1292889600,"12 21, 2010",2010,2198,"['Overview', 'Managing', 'freight', 'trains', 'really', 'exercise', 'logistics', 'objective', 'get', 'goods', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'quickly', 'safely', 'possible', 'route', 'may', 'be', 'different', 'switches', 'changeovers', 'may', 'be', 'encountered', 'Computers', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'scheduling', 'trains', 'order', 'optimize', 'use', 'rails', 'land', 'terms', 'ton-miles', 'hauled', 'unit', 'consumed', 'energy', 'rail', 'transport', 'more', 'efficient', 'other', 'means', 'transportation.This', 'film', 'half-mile', 'long', 'freight', 'train', 'was', 'allowed', 'run', 'away', 'engineer', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'careless', 'too', 'slow', 'Initially', 'was', 'thought', 'was', ""'coaster"", 'just', 'rolling', 'not', 'power', 'tried', 'initial', 'interception', 'track', 'surprise', 'train', 'long', 'gone', 'now', 'moving', 'speed', 'approaching', '70', 'miles', 'hour', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'train', 'huge', 'amount', 'diesel', 'fuel', 'carrying', 'keep', 'running', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'several', 'cars', 'contain', 'explosive', 'toxic', 'chemicals', 'are', 'used', 'make', 'glue.The', 'Heroes', 'guys', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'last', 'effort', 'ot', 'stop', 'train', 'are', 'Frank', 'Denzil', 'Washington', 'veteran', 'engineer', '18', 'years', 'experience.-', 'Will', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'rookie', 'now', 'getting', 'hands-on', 'little', 'animosity', 'two', 'initally', 'Frank', 'old', 'hand', 'being', 'phased', 'out', 'replaced', 'inexperienced', 'novice', 'only', 'theoretical', 'training', 'However', 'when', 'crisis', 'arises', 'set', 'aside', 'differences', 'rise', 'challenge.The', 'Experience', 'Watching', 'movie', 'riveting', 'experience', 'momentum', 'mass', 'x', 'velocity', 'trains', 'come', 'screen', 'big', 'time', 'are', 'close', 'passes', 'near', 'misses', 'can', 'make', 'sweat', 'just', 'watching', 'lot', 'stunt', 'work', 'especially', 'ending', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'movie', 'tension', 'build', 'end', 'indeed', 'quite', 'rewarding', 'know', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'edge', 'back', 'again.Conclusion', 'What', 'like', 'movie', 'way', 'determination', 'resolve', 'human', 'spirit', 'risk', 'everything', 'safety', 'others']",N/A

Probably for audience breathing time the story line introduces some psychological exchanges between the two characters - in formation about their family lives that seem oddly out of place with all the terror on the screen - and that aspect of the film adds some human drama that makes the final product more credible: it is, actually based on a true story. The fact that veteran action flick creators - writer Mark Bombeck and director Tony Scott - are 'on board' this project assures the popularity quotient.Frank (Denzel Washington) is an aging soon to be retired train engineer and is joined by a young, emotionally distracted but well-trained new conductor Will (Chris Pine) who are out on what seems to be a routine run in Pennsylvania.  They banter caustically until hearing that there is a full speed runaway train (engineer Dewey - Ethan Suplee - left his position in the train with the throttle on) that happens to be carrying toxic chemicals. Should the train proceed with its runaway course many lives could be endangered when the train reaches a critical curve in the tracts in Stanton , PA.  Frank decides the only way to stop the train would be to go in reverse and lock onto the back of the train, putting on the brakes to slow the runaway train.  Frank and Will decide to brave the elements and attempt this near impossible task, much against the advice of the chief Galvin (Kevin Dunn) but with the daring go ahead signal form the men's immediate boss Connie (Rosario Dawson).  During this breakneck chase Will relates his fragile marriage to a wife (Jessy Schram) who refuses to return or accept his calls and Frank confides in Will that his wife died a few years ago form cancer, leaving his the sole parent for his two daughters (Elizabeth Mathis and Meagan Tandy): they both have family deadlines to meet that very day.  How the two not only become friends but allies in heroic effort to stop the incipient tragedy makes of the ending of the film.Washington and Pine make fine acting partners and the off the tracks work by Dawson and Dunn and the other small parts are well executed.  The special effects are excellent.  The fact that seemingly far-fetched story is true adds to the appreciation of the film.  This is a solid action flick with some standout performances.

1313715,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002ZG99TA,Haunted Flower,"[4, 8]","""Unstoppable"" was directed by Tony Scott and stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, and Rosario Dawson in this story of a half-mile long runaway train that is compared in dialogue to a missile heading towards very populated areas. These characters all dance around the train, but the train itself in all its fire engine red glory is the star. How I wish they had just put more stuff in front of the train for it to destroy...The movie introduces the characters quickly. Chris Pine is Will, a rookie conductor trying to make ends meet while being separated from his wife and kid after a misunderstanding. Denzel Washington plays Frank, part of the old guard in the train yards and resentful of newbies coming in and taking their jobs. There's a bit of tension but eventually they will begrudgingly respect each other through the upcoming crisis.Some dimwits eating fast food and rushing their word accidentally set a large train in motion that has failed air brakes and accidentally put itself into gear. In a different light, the director could've played the possessed train with a taste for vengeance card, but instead it focuses on the fact that the doofusses were being morons. Rosario Dawson plays Connie, the woman communicating between all the trains and attempting to avert disaster while being stuck under management's thumb.Something that really bothers me about Tony Scott films is the shaky, blurry camera work to introduce a movie and make it INTENSE. He did the same thing with another train film, this one underground ""Pelham 123"". It's almost unwatchable. Very predictable. Dan turned to me before it started and asked, ""How much you wanna bet it opens with a sunrise coming over the train yard with a train drifting into view"" and BAM! There it was. Our big bad mean train is so cleverly painted RED so you'll never miss it in any shot. The little tiny train that Frank and Will drive is blue, the same color as Thomas the Tank engine and it's old and has everything against it, but darn-it-all, it's going to be the ""little engine that could"" by the end of this, you can just smell it.The train's speed starts high and just gets higher. Even when it's going 10mph, it looks like it's going 60 in the opening shots so the challenge Tony Scott has to face is how to make an already ridiculously fast looking train, get FASTER! There are tons of close calls and a cheap teases that children are going to be injured. And ""Unstoppable""? Spoiler alert, it's false advertising. ;-)  Fine for a random high-speed action movie, but you won't really care about the characters, just the train hitting stuff.Bonus Features:The Bonus Features are all starring THE TRAIN. In ""The Fastest Track: Unleashing Unstoppable"", Tony Scott discusses his love affair with helicopters, using them, shooting from them and how no one does train movies (except him I guess) and he really loves trains. In ""Derailed: Anatomy of a Scene"", you get to see the behind-the-scenes look at...a really fast train and the stunts that go along with it. Specifically in ""Hanging off the Train: Stunt work"", you see Chris Pine getting pelted with Sugar Puffs five inches away from serious injury.

But the incompetence of a fat yard worker allows a half-mile long freight loaded with hazardous chemicals to get loose and tear through the countryside. Our heroes then put aside their usual chores to catch up with the loco and hit the brakes all while head office and the media watch and wait.Sound exciting. It's not. There's no real sense of speed. Tony Scott tries to make the audience believe that the train is going really fast with lots of quick, shaky camera pans and some annoying stutter cuts (when will THIS dumb trend come to an end?). It hits a few bumps and scratches a few cars, but no significant damage is done and no breathtaking destruction fills the screen with eye candy.I really have to wonder where the appeal was in the script. There's really nothing worth mentioning between the moment the trains starts and stops (yes, it does indeed stop).

Also, I do think there's a bit of a plot flaw in the sense that a little creative thinking reveals some easier ways to stop that train, but that's not a major problem since most people probably won't think of these ways during the movie.On a more technical point, I have some professional experience with failure investigation, and I'd like to note that this scenario for developing a runaway train isn't unrealistic.  It may seem too coincidental for so many things to go wrong, both at physical and psychosocial levels, but that's generally how major failures happen.

Dawson lends strong support as the dispatcher who is trying to keep track of the situation as it spins out of control due to an arrogant and inept engineer and bad calls by a bottom-line-driven railroad exec.Action thriller fans will be munching fistfuls of popcorn as the runaway train picks up speed, and fans of good acting will appreciate the star turns of the leads.Highly recommended.",5,Untoppable,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,1260,"['taut', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'thriller', 'excellent', 'lead', 'performances', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Rosario', 'Dawson.Based', 'true', 'incident', 'film', 'tale', 'runaway', 'freight', 'train', 'derail', 'around', 'curve', 'Stanton', 'PA', 'spewing', 'load', 'toxic', 'chemicals', 'surrounding', 'community.Bucking', 'unfortunate', 'trend', 'DVDs', 'packing', 'minimal', 'extras', 'disc', 'commentary', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'as', 'well', 'informative', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'viewer', 'scope', 'production', 'director', 'insistence', 'shooting', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'camera', 'i.e', 'CGI', 'stopping', 'runaway', 'train', 'primary', 'story', 'here', 'vet', 'engineer', 'rookie', 'conductor', 'played', 'Washington', 'Pine', 'have', 'credible', 'back', 'stories', 'give', 'relationship', 'additional', 'edge', 'Dawson', 'strong', 'support', 'dispatcher', 'who', 'trying', 'keep', 'track', 'situation', 'control', 'due', 'arrogant', 'inept', 'engineer', 'bad', 'calls', 'bottom-line-driven', 'railroad', 'exec.Action', 'thriller', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'munching', 'fistfuls', 'popcorn', 'runaway', 'train', 'up', 'speed', 'fans', 'good', 'acting', 'will', 'appreciate', 'star', 'leads.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

It has a trace of humor (from Ned), and a few minor extra subplots to heighten the drama (Chris Pine's impending divorce, Denzel W's daughters and Galvin's gamble to save money vs. lives).With such a meager plot and little special effects, the movie has to rely on something else old fashioned - acting.

Once Will and Frank are told to find this train it becomes a race against the clock and also there's some people at the train center to advance the movie, the usual person who wants to just knock the train off the tracks no matter the damage to any nearby countryside, the one person whose on Frank and Will's side and a few other bit characters thrown in. Where this movie really shines is the pursuit and eventual catching up to the train, the whole concept of the movie sounds simple, even perhaps hokey but thanks to actors like Pine and especially Denzel this material works.I was very impressed with how the train sequences were done, Denzel was equal parts subdued and intense depending on the situation and Pine does show some acting chops here too.

1313759,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B002ZG99TA,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[1, 3]","There was a 1986 film called RUNAWAY TRAIN with Jon Voight. There was the exciting 1974 version of THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE with Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. There was the not-too-exciting 2009 version of THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 with Denzel Washington. Everybody I knew who had seen the original was convinced it was going to suck, and it did. Nevertheless, Tony Scott liked his own work in PELHAM 1 2 3 so much that he immediately rehashed it with UNSTOPPABLE, another Denzel Washington movie. Denzel, who used to do Oscar-caliber work such as PHILADELPHIA and MALCOLM X, is definitely on the downside of the hill and is in danger of being typecast as Choo-Choo Charlie. In PELHAM 1 2 3, he played the emotionally conflicted subway dispatcher. Here, he plays an emotionally conflicted locomotive engineer.UNSTOPPABLE is the story of a freight train loaded with hazmat cars that somehow gets away from the railmen and, engineerless, goes careening through rural Pennsylvania toward a large city. If the train derails in said large city, it will be the American Chernobyl. While this disaster is hanging over their heads, three quarters of everybody in Pennsylvania is standing around near the tracks watching and waiting for the train to derail. In real life, the mass evacuation spoken of in the film would have been a panic-stricken mass evacuation, not an excuse for a Statewide block party. Denzel is the engineer of the lone locomotive that is chasing the runaway train in order to hook up and possibly bring the thing to a halt safely. Unfortunately, UNSTOPPABLE never really gets moving; despite the suspenseful premise, the film lacks any real suspense since it is so full of cliches and set-piece action that we know how the film is going to end just as soon as it starts.There are no surprises in UNSTOPPABLE. We've seen it all before, and although it's worth a watch, it's not really as ""unstoppable"" as it is ""totally forgettable.""",3,"Train, Train Go Away . . .

Which is it?We're told the train is going 71 mph and is 10 miles from the next Big Event...and then it takes 20 minutes to get there, with no apparent back-time shots, etc. What, we can't do math?The tv helicopter hovers over the entire ride and almost hits the rescue chopper...and not one person ever mentions the danger or stupidity of that? Come on.Denzel is just getting lazy, or maybe he has no acting chops any more, or something, because every role he takes seems to require less and less thought and feeling, with the script supplying all the dramatic movement while DW just grimaces and looks fully committed to whatever crazy stunt he's about to let his stunt double do. Speaking of which, the hopping across trains at 75 mph at 60 years old with nary a hitch? Pull the other one.Pine is fine but feels like Paul Walker or any other of the new blond pretty boys who think scowling equals acting. Ditto most of the other actors here: bland. It just never felt right or real, but instead like a movie hyping itself at every turn.The final 20 minutes are better than the rest, but not by much. The final screen shot showing that Denzel's character got his full pension back is so funny it's a joke. The guy saves the entire company and gets a pat on the back? Believable, but for the movie to show it as some sort of justice is, like so much of this predictable Hollywood tripe, self-defeating.I love popcorn movies, and this is surely one, but both the director and star can do SO much better. Too bad they're just going for the easy money now.Speaking of which, this blu-ray package is a rip-off at 39, or even 20. Who needs a BD hi-def picture for a movie purposely shot extra-grainy and shaky to get that ""real feel""? Nobody. This blu-ray is a waste of money, and the extras are also on the dvd, so get that if you must, but better yet just rent this, or best yet, watch any of a thousand better popcorn action thrillers before you pop this one in the player. It's only Unstoppable if you let it get started...and even then that beer break will be such a relief.

1313762,A2ED6TMGB6O8DT,B002ZG99TA,Lawrence Kinsley,"[6, 17]","Yet another clich&eacute;-ridden and factually insulting movie from Tony Scott, a director with perhaps one-tenth the integrity and artistry of his brother Ridley. The absurdities of the various methods Scott portrays as attempts to stop the runaway train are little more than an insult to any sort of logic or intelligence, all the more so since it is claimed that the movie is based on a true incident. Just some examples:  if you can get a train engine just ahead of the runaway engine you simply have someone transfer from that engine's rear to the front of the runaway one; or when both trains were on the same track, have Denzel Washington reverse his, let the runaway train catch up to him, and have Chris Pine climb over to it and stop it that way; or if you decide to derail the beast and the mechanism to be used for some reason may be or proves to be unreliable, one single track removed manually or by explosives will do.But there appears to also be another problem with the movie no one seems to have caught. Twice Scott tries to ramp up the tension with near collisions with oncoming trains that just make it onto a safe siding - the second time after losing at least half of their cars in a collision with the runaway one. On the first occasion the runaway train would be able to pass through the switch despite it being open to the siding - unless the switch is locked in trains moving in the opposite direction will just move the angled tracks back to the normal straightaway configuration and pass along safely. But on the second occasion Washington's train was still moving onto the siding when the runaway train reached the switch. Heavy cars were already on the switched rails at the time, in other words, and it's almost impossible to believe that the runaway train could have simply plowed through and pushed the rails back straight without some debris getting in the way or damaging the rails at some point near the switch. Logically a derailment of the passing train should ensue, and the film should end at that point, instead of going on to the incredible scene of thousands of tons of train angled up on just one rail in the ninety degree curve without completely destroying both the rail and most likely the ancient appearing bridge it's fastened to!But that's okay, no doubt people who leave their brains at the theater door will be fully entertained.

1313779,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG99TA,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","I'll admit that when I first heard the storyline from the movie UNSTOPPABLE I didn't think it sounded very interesting. It's difficult to make a movie about a speeding train exciting. You know it's confined to a track and that it moves fast with the chance of slipping off the rails but how could that be exciting? The makers of this movie, especially director Tony Scott proved me wrong. And I'm glad about that.It's Will's (Chris Pine) first day as a conductor on a normal day for this train. His engineer is Frank (Denzell Washington), soon to retired and making one of his last runs. But their day will turn out to be anything but ordinary.Two goofups are at another station moving a different train. When the switch to move it to a different track isn't set, the engineer jumps down to reset it himself, leaving the train in neutral. Not only that, the air breaks haven't been set yet but since they're just moving it to another line they're not concerned. That is until the train shifts into high speed mode and leaves the station before he and his conductor can get on board.The train picks up speed the further down the line it goes. Without the air breaks there's no way to stop it. To make matters worse, the load this train was carrying contained dangerous toxic chemicals. If that wasn't enough, the line the train is heading down has a section with a tight curve that there is no way to make without derailing.The train is on a collision course with two trains on the same track. One is a group of school students learning about train safety. The other is Will and Frank's cargo train. Their train narrowly misses being demolished. After a discussion with controller Connie (Rosario Dawson), Frank comes up with a possible plan of his own to stop the train.As higher ups try and decide what to do Connie (Rosario Dawson) attempts to assist them. But of course they think she doesn't know what she's talking about and brush her off. They're plan is to derail the train in a smaller town with a piece of equipment that Frank has told Connie has no chance of working at the speed the train is moving. When it does indeed fail, Connie, Frank and Will follow through with their own plan, even though the top dogs have threatened to fire them if they do.The drama of the film escalates at the same pace the train is making. Frank and Will's train is racing against time going backwards to catch up to the non-stop express. Will they make it in time? Will their plan work? Hey, I might tell you a few things that happen in a movie but I won't reveal the end.Washington and Pine do a great job here as two men who just met but who become close through the situation they find themselves in. Each has problems of their own back home that play into their decision, but never to the point that they abandon the chance to save innocent lives. These are not men who became heroes over time but who have a definite moral core that guides them to make the choice to save lives.Based on a true story, the events that unfold in this film are set at a pace that won't allow you to sit still comfortable on the couch and not care. It draws you in, waiting to see what attempts are made, which ones work and waiting to see if the plan Frank and Will have come up with must be used or not.The pacing of the film is perfect. Not only does Scott gradually increase the speed of the train, he slowly unravels the stories of the two heroes as well. Back history and current situations drive them to the decision they make. And that makes for not just an interesting film but one that holds your interest from the time the train leaves the station until the climax of the film. This one is one you won't want to miss.",4,NON STOP ACTION,1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,3704,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'storyline', 'movie', 'UNSTOPPABLE', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'sounded', 'very', 'interesting', 'difficult', 'make', 'movie', 'speeding', 'train', 'exciting', 'know', 'confined', 'track', 'fast', 'chance', 'slipping', 'off', 'rails', 'how', 'could', 'that', 'be', 'exciting', 'makers', 'movie', 'especially', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'proved', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'glad', 'that.It', 'Will', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'first', 'day', 'conductor', 'normal', 'day', 'train', 'engineer', 'Frank', 'Denzell', 'Washington', 'soon', 'retired', 'making', 'one', 'last', 'runs', 'day', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'anything', 'ordinary.Two', 'goofups', 'are', 'station', 'moving', 'different', 'train', 'When', 'switch', 'move', 'different', 'track', ""n't"", 'set', 'engineer', 'down', 'reset', 'leaving', 'train', 'neutral', 'Not', 'only', 'air', 'breaks', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'set', 'yet', ""'re"", 'just', 'moving', 'line', ""'re"", 'not', 'concerned', 'train', 'shifts', 'high', 'speed', 'mode', 'station', 'conductor', 'can', 'get', 'board.The', 'train', 'up', 'speed', 'further', 'down', 'line', 'air', 'way', 'stop', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'load', 'train', 'was', 'carrying', 'contained', 'dangerous', 'toxic', 'chemicals', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'line', 'train', 'heading', 'down', 'section', 'tight', 'curve', 'way', 'make', 'derailing.The', 'train', 'collision', 'course', 'two', 'trains', 'same', 'track', 'One', 'group', 'school', 'students', 'learning', 'train', 'safety', 'other', 'Will', 'Frank', 'cargo', 'train', 'train', 'narrowly', 'being', 'demolished', 'discussion', 'controller', 'Connie', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Frank', 'up', 'possible', 'plan', 'own', 'stop', 'train.As', 'higher', 'ups', 'try', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'Connie', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'assist', 'course', 'think', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'talking', 'brush', 'off', ""'re"", 'plan', 'derail', 'train', 'smaller', 'town', 'piece', 'equipment', 'Frank', 'told', 'Connie', 'chance', 'working', 'speed', 'train', 'moving', 'When', 'indeed', 'fail', 'Connie', 'Frank', 'Will', 'follow', 'own', 'plan', 'even', 'top', 'dogs', 'have', 'threatened', 'fire', 'do.The', 'drama', 'film', 'same', 'pace', 'train', 'making', 'Frank', 'Will', 'train', 'racing', 'time', 'going', 'backwards', 'catch', 'up', 'non-stop', 'express', 'make', 'time', 'Will', 'plan', 'work', 'Hey', 'might', 'tell', 'few', 'things', 'happen', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'end.Washington', 'Pine', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'just', 'met', 'who', 'become', 'close', 'situation', 'find', 'problems', 'own', 'back', 'home', 'play', 'decision', 'never', 'point', 'abandon', 'chance', 'save', 'innocent', 'lives', 'are', 'not', 'men', 'who', 'became', 'heroes', 'time', 'who', 'have', 'definite', 'moral', 'core', 'make', 'choice', 'save', 'lives.Based', 'true', 'story', 'events', 'unfold', 'film', 'are', 'set', 'pace', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'sit', 'still', 'comfortable', 'couch', 'not', 'care', 'waiting', 'see', 'what', 'attempts', 'are', 'made', 'ones', 'work', 'waiting', 'see', 'plan', 'Frank', 'Will', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'must', 'be', 'used', 'not.The', 'pacing', 'film', 'perfect', 'Not', 'only', 'Scott', 'gradually', 'increase', 'speed', 'train', 'slowly', 'stories', 'two', 'heroes', 'as', 'well', 'Back', 'history', 'current', 'situations', 'drive', 'decision', 'make', 'not', 'just', 'interesting', 'film', 'one', 'interest', 'time', 'train', 'station', 'climax', 'film', 'one', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss']",N/A

At Fuller Yard in Northern Pennsylvania, the 39-car train 777 gets away from its operator when he abandons the cabin to fix a switch. Meanwhile, at Brewster Yard in Southern Pennsylvania, veteran engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and novice conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine) don't quite hit it off. They're heading toward Stanton in train 1206. When it is discovered that 777 is not coasting but is under power and picking up speed, carrying a load of molten phenol and diesel fuel, the Fuller yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) clashes with her company's VP Oscar Gavin (Kevin Dunn) on how to cope with the crisis.The day begins slowly, as people go about their jobs on the railroad. It takes everyone a while to grasp the extent of the problem. The audience gets to know them. The film's title sequence claims it was ""inspired by true events"", a reference to a 2001 train mishap in Ohio involving a runaway train carrying molten phenol. It wasn't nearly so hair-raising in real life, but the element of near-plausibility makes ""Unstoppable"" more compelling. It's a race against time, not against high-tech gadgetry. The train must be stopped before it reaches a curve in Stanton, which will cause it to derail and spew toxic chemicals. The technology that can be brought to bear on the problem is limited. It's a railroad. So this is an old-fashioned action movie, punched up with some doom and gloom and the occasional explosion, but thoroughly enjoyable.",4,"A Runaway Train. A Race Against Time.

A single sloppy employee could cause such colossal havoc by his mere inability to run, walk, or climb stairs? In a modern high tech world, a train company has no remote access to the engine of an unmanned train? It sounded like 9/11 revisited, where simple human failure could cause such immense loss of lives.It starts with a heavy weight, unfit, and apparently semi-dead employee who was entrusted to drive a freight train. The moviemaker would put that poor guy in many spots along the scenes in order too invoke anger on his miserable human condition. Aside from such petty display, the photography of the scenes was mediocre at best with poor angling and zooming that made things unreal.Even though the action was unstoppable, it was shocking to see the dismal technical failure of a train company where no one seems to know how to stop an unmanned train. With the millions of dollars spent to build such vast resources, a remote control from Toys-R-Us would sound a perfect solution to kill the engine of fright train that ran loose from a sleazy employee.The first attempt to slow the train, with another leading train, sounded foolishly stupid according to any law of conservation of momentum or energy. The second method of shooting at the fuel tanks of the train with police guns sounded equally stupid. Then came the derailing blocks that shattered on impact. Dynamiting the rails have been played in movies for many decades and would have stopped the unstoppable train in a safe location. It is hard to imagine that the state of Pennsylvania lacked such expertise in explosives similar to those deployed in Yugoslavia and Iraq where structures were hit from hundreds of miles away with GPS technology and laser guided missiles.The third attempt to pull the train from its rear end did not differ much from the first one. So, where did all the brains migrate? It started with an attempt to land a man on the train from a Helicopter.  Yet, somehow all the Helicopters that were shown in the movie could not catch up with the 70 mph unmanned train. Who did? an off duty worker chasing the train on parallel roads in his pick up truck?It all sounded like some heroes from the far past have come to live to save a freight company that could not afford to hire a high school pupil knowledgeable with the laws of motion. What started with dropping a man into the train cabinet, ended by accomplishing that with twists of cursing, heroism, and plenty of bureaucratic red tapes.

Based on a real life incident, a mile long freight train carrying toxic chemicals is turned loose - by accident not terrorists - across the Pennsylvania countryside.  Frank (Washington) and Will (Chris Pine), become reluctant heroes who get stuck on the same track.  The film is the right length (98 min.) and has the right plot.  That is, not much of one.  Just the train hauling ass across the state.  Not much sidetracks the action.  Just how it happened, how can it be fixed and can it be done in an hour and a half.

The plot is basic, the acting is secondary, and the whole semi-boring idea of a train on the loose kept me away from seeing Unstoppable in theaters until two weeks after its release. I watched it with a few of my relatives in town for Thanksgiving and everyone said that they enjoyed it, but it's one of those you can easily forget as soon as you make your way from the theater to your car. There will be little to no discussions afterwards, other than saying it was entertaining. I've seen plenty of movies where that alone is not a bad thing, though most don't have Denzel Washington in the lead role and cost over 100 million dollars. Denzel and Chris ""Captain Kirk"" Pine do share a couple of moments of good chemistry, on top of likeable performances. There are also some nice realistic action sequences mixed in with genuine moments of suspense. I'm going back and forth on a three or four star rating, but I think I'll have to take off a star for the sheer lack of depth.

1313795,AUI702QTNKN1E,B002ZG99TA,movie lover,"[0, 0]","There are a few too many serious flaws I see in this film.1.  If the train engines that pull in front and match speed why can't the engineer simply get from the engines in front onto the runaway train engine without using a helicopter?  The person attempting to board would be safer doing so from an engine in front of the runaway than from the air.2.  When the train goes around the S curve in Stanton at too high a rate of speed the tank cars would definitely tip over and come off of the tracks due to fluid inside being thrown with centrifical force against the side of the tank.  Anyone can tell you that tanker trucks and tanker train cars are the most hazardous to because the fluid inside is constantly moving and changing the center of gravity.3.  When the railroad worker in the pickup catches up to the train engine why did he cut off his dispatcher who could have easily told the conductor he should hop in back of the pickup to ride up to the engine.  But instead he cuts her off.  He would rather yell and honk than simply have her relay the message.4.  When the train is going to be derailed (just outside) the small town, the train is actually inside the town on a curved section of track.  Why would the people be anywhere near the train, why would the police cars be anywhere near where it was expected to derail?  After all derailing a train is messy.  Cars flying everywhere.  The tanker cars could explode and kill hundreds of people if thery were within a half mile of the train.  Plus the momentum of the derailment would go toward where people are standing, where there are homes and destroy everything nearby.

So of course the only two people who can stop the runaway train are Barnes and Colson! They have aid in the form of Connie Hooper(played by Rosario Dawson) a train yardmaster who has radio contact with them. Oscar Galvin(played by Kevin Dunn) is vice-president of AWVR and all he cares about is the money and bad publicity it's going to cost them. So what follows is Galvin trying loads of different ways to stop the train before it hits the curve in Stanton which is home to Colson's estranged wife. What follows is a fast paced movie that doesn't require too much attention to follow, no mad twists or disgruntled villains out to blow up the world unless he gets his money, no it's just a runaway train.The movie is inspired by the CSX 8888 incident that happened in Ohio in 2001 which also involved a runaway train.

1313809,A1SV22OU1E7XRX,B002ZG99TA,ocarolan,"[0, 0]","In May of 2001, a 47-car freight train belonging to the CSX Corporation rolled out of rail yards near Toledo. Twenty-five of the train's cars were empty. Of the 22 cars that were not, two were tank cars containing liquid phenol, a hazardous chemical (though not in itself explosive). This particular train was noteworthy because, as a spokesperson for CSX explained to the media, the engineer was ""nearby"" when the train departed - ""nearby"" being PR-speak for ""not on board.""  Over the following two hours, the unmanned train traversed 66 miles of Ohio countryside, at one point reaching a speed of 47 mph (though, as simple arithmetic suggests, averaging around 33 mph). Police manned crossings to ensure the train passed without incident. A second engine managed to link to the train and, by braking, slow it to 10 mph on an upgrade, where a railroad employee was able to board the train and stop it.From acorns mighty oak trees grow. In Hollywood, incidents like the one described above inspire movies: movies that, like mighty oak trees, belie their humble origins.  But isn't that one of Hollywood's imperatives: to spin entertaining tales from events of real life, and in doing so, transport us to magical realms? Yes! Unfortunately, the trip this film took me on is one I have taken before: the scenery and the stops were all-too familiar, as were the people I met along the way. [Spoiler!] Crucially, I found zero suspense in the fate of the train: were it to derail and precipitate the potential disaster suggested, what would you do with Denzel Washington's and Chris Pine's characters? Indeed, where would you take the story? No, the story only works (if it works at all) if it ends with cheers and high-fives all around.

And it's always the working stiff, lower/middle class young couple in the midst of a seperation. The woman, with a child of course, always has that semi-stressed out look about her.  Of course at the end of the movie they all reunite happily ever after.b) The obligatory heliocopter chase scenes. What were all those TV news choppers flying around the runaway train?  You mean the police could not keep them away? There they were complicating all the rescue efforts and no one tried stopping them?c) Washington, playing a guy in his advanced middle age, is able to hop effortlessly across the tops of speeding railroad cars like a cat?d) And of course lets never leave out the villains as paunchy, golf-playing, heartless white guys. Heaven forbid that they should be portrayed as capable and caring. That would be politically incorrect. And the guy who loses the train in the first place? An overweight white guy of course.

Anyway i went into the movie thinking ""i don't know, how great could a movie about a train be?"" Well i was completely shocked at how much i liked the movie it was really good and full of suspense even at the beginning before the train is sent off unmanned under power.

This doesn't allow you to relax it keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch...wondering...waiting... Once the train is set loose it is non stop suspense as the train threatens everyone in the vicinity of it with its speed, weight, cargo and shear power.

Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson and Kevin Dunn turn in good performances all around. The tension is on point for pretty much the entire time. I saw many people in the audience on the edges of their seats. Literally. I'm not just saying that because it's the cliche thing to say about a suspenseful movie. I heard plenty of gasps and 'oh no's' throughout the film, so it accomplished it's goal to exhilarate. Problem is, it fails to rise above what you see in the trailers. Big freight train carrying toxic chemicals is on the run, unmanned, and two unlikely partners have to save the day. Sorry for the cliche, but this movie is just the same old s**t on a different day (but with convincing characters). The main problem is just as I stated above. This movie is nothing more than what you see in the trailers. So if you liked what you saw, this is right for you. If it looked lame from the get-go, then guess what? ... Exactly. That said, I was actually one who thought to myself, ""what the hell are Tony Scott and Denzel Washington making another train movie for if the last one (Pelham 123 remake) wasn't well received?"" They have teamed up to make some pretty good movies in the past, or at least decent ones to other people that I loved (Man on Fire, Deja Vu, Crimson Tide).This movie falls closer along the lines of another Taking of Pelham 123, but much more exhillerating. That could be a good or bad thing, depending on your point of view. I've come not to expect much from Tony Scott, and that usually works for me.  If you take him at face value, you may enjoy most of his lesser appreciated movies more than you expect to. Another huge issue I had were the quick cuts, and the unsteady camera. How old are the gliding camera shots that pan across actors' faces when they're talking? I'm fairly tired of it, personally, but I can accept it when it shows a cinematographer's intent on doing something to aid the suspencs. And after the third camera shot from the tracks, beneath the train as it passes over, I got a little aggrivated. These old, and often annoying methods can work, and not irritate people like me if only the director and director of photography would learn the concept of moderation. Once, or even twice is fine, but beyond that is just overkill. These methods do work at getting some people in the audience's heart rates slightly elevated, but overall, they often end up coming off as cheap gimmicks when overdone. Now don't get me wrong.

1313840,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002ZG99TA,RMurray847,"[2, 4]","Normally, I can barely tolerate Tony Scott's frantic, even frenzied, directing style.  He's all about fast cuts, swooping angles and cursory character development.  He's often a bit like Michael Bay, with at least with a better visual sense.  His films often indicate changes in time or mood through a change in color saturation.  You CANNOT see one of his films and not constantly be reminded that you're watching a movie.  Films like MAN ON FIRE and TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 give me a headache.UNSTOPPABLE is a film that finally has Scott back on track (pun intended).  His directing style hasn't changed...heck, it even stars his constant collaborator Denzel Washington.  But the story matches his style.  A runaway train, however scary such a thing might be, can pretty much only go straight and predictably...but Scott's over-baked sound mix, crazy editing and challenging camera angles make this hurtling train feel like a living monster.The story is set in Pennsylvania.  At one end of the state, a bunch of useless railyard workers, through a series of bad choices, send a train pulling a large load of toxic chemicals on its way with the throttle down and no one on board.  Coming in the other direction are various obstacles...and another freight train carrying experienced railman Denzel and rookie conductor Chris Pine (from the recent STAR TREK).  Eventually, these two guys find themselves needing make some difficult choices in order to try to stop this crazy train from killing thousands of people.  That's really about all the film is about...yet it is very gripping.We learn (or feel like we're learning) a lot about the workings of trains and rail systems.  Rosario Dawson, in a thankless role, is the person in the control booth with all the lights and microphones and computers around her (you know, sort of like the room Washington sat in for most of TAKING OF PELHAM...).  Her job is to spout statistics and physics, and to get into ridiculous yelling matches with the corporate suits, who can't make a single reasonable decision.  It's one thing to try to cast scorn on corporate types...it's another to make them behave about as brightly as a teenager in a slasher movie.But the movie rests very comfortably on the shoulders of Washington and Pine.  Washington is in coasting mode, relying primarily on his still considerable charisma.  But he's smart and funny, and is simply a professional doing a great job of playing another professional in another profession.  But best of all is Pine.  I liked him a lot in STAR TREK (as Captain Kirk), but I worried that he was getting by on good looks and a smart mouth, coupled with a spectacle of a movie.  But here, he's still ""hunky"", but he feels blue collar and convincing.  When called upon to act bravely, he doesn't come off as a hero, but as a guy making tough choices in order to protect loved ones.  The two men have good chemistry...there's a little bit of the ""old timer giving the new kid a hard time"" banter...but less than I would have expected.  I wouldn't say their scenes are particularly well-written; they simply do a nice job with what they've got.Meanwhile, the two trains hurtle, helicopters fly, mishaps and crashes occur all leading up to a remarkably tense and exciting final 15 minutes.

First enters Pine whose wife has a restraining order out on him as he is walking into his first day on the job at the train yard.Next is Denzel who has 28 years under his belt,but is getting short pensioned after 28 years.He and his colleagues are less than cordial to Pine who blame he and his ilk for their  fall in fortunes.Denzel is partnered with Pine who is conducting the train.They take an engine out to retrieve a train load of zinc and return it to the yard.Meanwhile in the yard circumstances are set into motion which will change many lives.A lazy train worker gets sloppy,jumps off a slow moving train to change a switch,but the controls he left in place slip and change,setting the locomotive off on its own.It picks up speed and is bound eventually for the highly populated city of Scranton,Pa.Back down the same line the train is headed toward is Denzel and Pine.Frantic efforts and ideas to stop the train from the yard master and her underlings meet with no success.A later effort to derail the train purposely also is going to fail,but Denzel and Pine decide to race in reverse after the train in an attempt to hook up to it and slow it down.This they manage to do but it isn't enough.Pine gets injured in the attempt and Denzel decides to go topside of the runaway train cars and manually hit each ones brakes.This does the trick and the train manages to make it through a bad curve in Scranton.Their engine's brakes have failed and the runaway is picking up speed again.Denzel is stuck and can't get over a car loaded with pipes.A fast moving pick up truck of an employee who has been following them comes by and picks up Pine.He races him to the front of the train and Pine just manages to grab on the rail,get aboard and finally stop the train.The film ends as both men are being celebrated.Pine has gotten back together with his wife and Denzel has had his pension and job reinstated.Once the introductions are over and the train is in runaway mode,the film's tension just never lets up.The late director Scott did a bang up job here,and the actors manage to convey their characters as just two ordinary guys caught up in circumstances beyond their control.The action on and around both trains is spectacular as police cordone off roads,helicopters fly in pursuit and tensions amongst the railroad brass build to a crescendo.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary,featurettes and deleted scenes.All in all one movie full of tension and action.The actors do a spot on job with their characters and director Scott did a great job throughout.This was Scott's second to last film.Recommended.",4,A real nail biter,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,2978,"['Unstoppable', 'released', 'Nov/10', 'stars',

But even he couldn't salvage a movie so cliche'd as to defy description. I can usually ignore gross errors in films or action liberties but this movie went way beyond what I could tolerate.If it were advertised as a pure entertainment/over the top action/adventure movie then I would have ignored its failures but not when it is supposed to be a reality based disaster movie. At the beginning of the movie, it says it is based on a true story! If this movie was really based on a true story then woe is us because our train system is being run by idiots.If you know nothing about trains, cars, trucks, diesel fuel, etc and can ignore some serious stupidity then you might like this movie. It definitely has a lot of action and tension. It would be a good movie for kids as there is nothing bad in the movie, no swearing, no sex, no violence and it has heroes, lots of action and bad guys.On the other hand, ignore the following if you don't want to know what happens in the movie although the outcome should be obvious.The fundamental problem is that the movie ignores the obvious and does so repeatedly. They initially try to catch the runaway with a pickup truck that can run on rails (no problem with that as it is a common railroad vehicle). But it fails. And nobody thinks to put one in front going same speed then slow down until the runaway catches up and transfer someone to the runaway?Instead they use a helicopter to attempt to land a person on the runaway train but it fails also, then they stop trying? If you've got a train with an extremely toxic load, wouldn't you try and try until you succeeded? The alternative is massive destruction and loss of life, yet in the movie they only tried once. And you don't need a railroad expert either so you could use almost anyone.However, they do put another train (two locomotives) in front but with only one person on board and which slows down to catch the runaway train but why didn't they try to have someone then go from that train to the runaway? But of course this train crashes and the operator gets killed. Then they won't switch the train onto a siding to derail it but instead use some gimmicky Derailer that of course doesn't work either. Then they have a single locomotive (operated by Washington and Pine) which amazingly is able to slow down the runaway (which has two locomotives)! The ""Incredible Plan to Stop the Train"" was nothing more than catching it, hooking up and using the single locomotive to slow it down. Guess what? It doesn't work. They do eventually manage to stop the runaway and amazingly it stops on a dime even though all the brakes for the other cars are disconnected?And toss in a train full of kids (got to have kids in danger to add to the excitement). And the money grubbing executives who only care about the dollar loss. And the government official who just happens to be there (nice coincidence) and who tells a 28 year railroad veteran how to stop the runaway.There were even more cliche's but I won't bother to detail them, this movie had so many it was ludicrous.",1,I like action and disaster movies but this was a disaster.,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,3161,"['only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'acting', 'always', 'outstanding', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'salvage', 'movie', 'so', 'cliche', ""'d"", 'defy', 'description', 'can', 'usually', 'ignore', 'gross', 'errors', 'films', 'action', 'liberties', 'movie', 'went', 'way', 'what', 'could', 'tolerate.If', 'were', 'advertised', 'pure', 'top', 'action/adventure', 'movie', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'ignored', 'failures', 'not', 'when', 'supposed', 'be', 'reality', 'based', 'disaster', 'movie', 'beginning', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'then', 'woe', 'train', 'system', 'being', 'run', 'idiots.If', 'know', 'nothing', 'trains', 'cars', 'trucks', 'diesel', 'fuel', 'etc', 'can', 'ignore', 'serious', 'stupidity', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'movie', 'definitely', 'lot', 'action', 'tension', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'kids', 'nothing', 'bad', 'movie', 'swearing', 'sex', 'violence', 'heroes', 'lots', 'action', 'bad', 'guys.On', 'other', 'hand', 'ignore', 'following', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'outcome', 'should', 'be', 'obvious.The', 'fundamental', 'problem', 'movie', 'obvious', 'so', 'repeatedly', 'initially', 'try', 'catch', 'runaway', 'pickup', 'truck', 'can', 'run', 'rails', 'problem', 'common', 'railroad', 'vehicle', 'nobody', 'thinks', 'put', 'one', 'front', 'going', 'same', 'speed', 'then', 'slow', 'down', 'runaway', 'up', 'transfer', 'someone', 'runaway', 'Instead', 'use', 'helicopter', 'attempt', 'land', 'person', 'runaway', 'train', 'also', 'then', 'stop', 'trying', ""'ve"", 'got', 'train', 'extremely', 'toxic', 'load', 'would', ""n't"", 'try', 'try', 'succeeded', 'alternative', 'massive', 'destruction', 'loss', 'life', 'yet', 'movie', 'only', 'tried', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'railroad', 'expert', 'so', 'could', 'use', 'almost', 'anyone.However', 'do', 'put', 'train', 'two', 'locomotives', 'front', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'board', 'down', 'catch', 'runaway', 'train', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'have', 'someone', 'then', 'go', 'train', 'runaway', 'course', 'train', 'crashes', 'operator', 'killed', 'Then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'switch', 'train', 'siding', 'derail', 'instead', 'use', 'gimmicky', 'Derailer', 'course', ""n't"", 'work', 'either', 'Then', 'have', 'single', 'locomotive', 'operated', 'Washington', 'Pine', 'amazingly', 'able', 'slow', 'down', 'runaway', 'two', 'locomotives', 'Incredible', 'Plan', 'Stop', 'Train', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'catching', 'hooking', 'up', 'using', 'single', 'locomotive', 'slow', 'down', 'Guess', 'what', ""n't"", 'work', 'do', 'eventually', 'manage', 'stop', 'runaway', 'amazingly', 'dime', 'even', 'brakes', 'other', 'cars', 'are', 'disconnected', 'toss', 'train', 'full', 'kids', 'got', 'have', 'kids', 'danger', 'add', 'excitement', 'money', 'grubbing', 'executives', 'who', 'only', 'care', 'dollar', 'loss', 'government', 'official', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'there', 'nice', 'coincidence', 'who', '28', 'year', 'railroad', 'veteran', 'how', 'stop', 'runaway.There', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'cliche', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'detail', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'was', 'ludicrous']",N/A
1313852,A3HZ2D336K7QSY,B002ZG99TA,"Scott Martin Gavin ""yukicat1""","[1, 2]","This movie is fun, and showcases the talents of a stable of very well cast actors. I missed the movie in the theater and wasn't sure what to expect. The only problem I had with this movie was that it is practically impossible for a train to run away they way they showed it in the movie. Airbrakes work the opposite way you expect. When an engineer pumps air into the brake line, it RELEASES the brakes on the train. If the hoses were disconnected between the cars, as depicted in the movie, the air would bleed out of the brake lines APPLYING the brakes. The only way for a train to run away the way they showed it in the movie was if all the air hoses were connected, the brake lines charged with air to release the brakes, and then some nobnoggin would have to go back and close the angle cocks on the brake lines on both cars where the hoses were supposedly disconnected, and then and only then, unfasten the brake hoses. Which they didn't show happening. And, even with the brake hoses all connected, without a air pump constantly keeping the air lines charged, the air in the brake line would slowly leak out, eventually applying the brakes.Conversely, when either of the locomotives caught up to the train, they wouldn't have had to couple onto the runaway to stop it, all they would have had to do was to get close enough for somebody to reach across and lean down and open the angle cock on the air line of the first car. Dangerous but not as risky as trying to couple onto the cars. Once the angle cock was open, the air would bleed out of the brake lines, automatically applying the brakes.The movie claims to be based on real events, and if this is true, either they didn't show the brakes being ""properly"" misused in the film, or it was based on a story from the steam train days back before they had perfecting the Westinghouse air brake.I would have given this movie five stars but there was just too much stuff you had to ignore to make it believeable.",4,Good fun but not credible,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,1968,"['movie', 'fun', 'talents', 'stable', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'actors', 'missed', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'practically', 'impossible', 'train', 'run', 'away', 'way', 'showed', 'movie', 'Airbrakes', 'work', 'opposite', 'way', 'expect', 'When', 'engineer', 'pumps', 'air', 'brake', 'line', 'RELEASES', 'brakes', 'train', 'hoses', 'were', 'disconnected', 'cars', 'depicted', 'movie', 'air', 'would', 'bleed', 'brake', 'lines', 'APPLYING', 'brakes', 'only', 'way', 'train', 'run', 'away', 'way', 'showed', 'movie', 'was', 'air', 'hoses', 'were', 'connected', 'brake', 'lines', 'charged', 'air', 'release', 'brakes', 'then', 'nobnoggin', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'close', 'angle', 'cocks', 'brake', 'lines', 'cars', 'where', 'hoses', 'were', 'supposedly', 'disconnected', 'then', 'only', 'then', 'brake', 'hoses', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'happening', 'even', 'brake', 'connected', 'air', 'pump', 'constantly', 'keeping', 'air', 'lines', 'charged', 'air', 'brake', 'line', 'would', 'slowly', 'leak', 'out', 'eventually', 'applying', 'brakes.Conversely', 'when', 'locomotives', 'caught', 'up', 'train', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'couple', 'runaway', 'stop', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'get', 'close', 'enough', 'somebody', 'reach', 'lean', 'down', 'open', 'angle', 'cock', 'air', 'line', 'first', 'car', 'Dangerous', 'not', 'as', 'risky', 'trying', 'couple', 'cars', 'Once', 'angle', 'cock', 'was', 'open', 'air', 'would', 'bleed', 'brake', 'lines', 'automatically', 'applying', 'brakes.The', 'movie', 'claims', 'be', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'true', 'either', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'brakes', 'being', 'properly', 'misused', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'story', 'steam', 'train', 'days', 'back', 'had', 'perfecting', 'Westinghouse', 'air', 'brake.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'stuff', 'had', 'ignore', 'make', 'believeable']",N/A

Predictable but great acting from Denzel Washington and Chris Pine. And the best part: the movie ran at just over 90 minutes breaking from what seems to be Hollywood's latest unwritten law that says movies need to run past the 2-hour mark. Thanks, Tony Scott.Scott likes the train business I guess and he brought Denzel with him again after they rodePelham 1 2 3together back in 2009. And it's funny....Either a major coincidence has occurred or Tony Scott said to Denzel, ""Could you just play the same character that you played in our last movie?"" Come to think of it, I think Denzel has played the same character in his last 20-something movies. Clearly the guy has just found a character comfort zone that he knows the audience will love every time. And indeed the Denzel character works. The last time I saw Denzel not playing the same character that he was playing in Unstoppable was all the way back in 1992'sMalcolm X(he played Malcolm X).I was definitely entertained by Unstoppable. Simple story: A careless accident causes a freight train to go on a runaway path unmanned and at full throttle. Washington and Pine are respectively engineer and conductor in the field who take it upon themselves to come up with a plan to stop the out of control train. And of course Denzel's corporate superiors, government emergency forces and the cops are all idiots (as Hollywood so predictably and consistently casts). Director Scott keeps the movie rolling down the track with some decent suspenseful action as the mild mannered combination of Denzel and Chris Pine attempt to save the day.All in all, excellent rental but far from worthy of purchase for your collection.

Fortunately you get exactly these attributes in Frank and Will.Washington (as Frank) is as good as we have come to expect and Chris Pine plays the roll of Will very well indeed.

I'm a big Denzel fan but that's besides the point.VIDEO...The transfer from Standard Def to Blu Ray leaves nothing wanting.  While I do not have the Standard Def version to make any comparisons to, the Blu Ray version really is pristine.  There were no artifacts or aliasing in any part of the film and no noticeable or intrusive film grain.  However, while the directors tried to limit the amount of CGI effects for the train, I could tell when it was used.  Most probably could, especially when the train 777 takes that last and most dangerous curve in Stanton.  Never the less, the colors in this film are very realistic and bright and the contrast is excellent with good detailing in any of the darker areas.  In the beginning, the film appeared to have a somewhat desaturated look, especially when the character played by Chris Pine is introduced to the other track men, including Denzel's character.  After that point, color grading is amped to a very, but not overly warm hue.  Mbps appeared to average in the low to mid thirties.  Video here is really what we hope all Blu Rays will look like.AUDIO...The audio is DTS HD MA 5.1 and the lossless audio always makes a big difference in my book.  Dialogue is always easy to understand and doesn't do battle with the music score or foley effects of which there are many.  While there is a good amount of tracking from the front stage to the rear, you really aren't so much aware of discreet directionality of the audio as you are of the fully encompassing of yourself into both sound stages.  Your LFE channel will be working throughout almost the entire film and while the bottom end doesn't reach to the deepest Hz, it is fully present as a speeding train would demand.EXTRAS...Unfortunately, there are advertisements for the value of a digital copy and two previews of other films.  This makes you having to pay for ads when your money should go to even less compression and an even better transfer to the Blu Ray disc.  Also there is the typical commentaries, a doc on the making of, a feature on a few of the stunts.  There are no extended cuts or deleted scenes which I usually like to see.  The digital copy is a separate disc which is wonderful and easy to install and transfer to your computer and other gizmos.  It's a heck of a lot better than having to deal with UltraViolet and others of that type.All in all, if you do not have this exciting and suspenseful film on Blu Ray, I do recommend that you get it.  The quality of the disc is very good all around and the 5 stars I gave it refer to that quality and not how much I did or did not care for the film.All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.Thanks for reading.",5,Unstoppable on Blu Ray,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,3144,"['everyone', 'else', 'already', 'provided', 'summaries', 'storyline', 'opinions', 'acting', 'everything', 'else', 'will', 'always', 'do', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'film', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'film', ""'Unstoppable"", ""'m"", 'big', 'Denzel', 'fan', 'point.VIDEO', 'transfer', 'Standard', 'Def', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'nothing', 'wanting', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'make', 'comparisons', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'really', 'pristine', 'were', 'artifacts', 'aliasing', 'part', 'film', 'noticeable', 'intrusive', 'film', 'grain', 'However', 'directors', 'tried', 'limit', 'amount', 'CGI', 'effects', 'train', 'could', 'tell', 'when', 'was', 'used', 'Most', 'probably', 'could', 'especially', 'when', 'train', '777', 'last', 'most', 'dangerous', 'curve', 'Stanton', 'less', 'colors', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'bright', 'contrast', 'excellent', 'good', 'detailing', 'darker', 'areas', 'beginning', 'film', 'appeared', 'have', 'somewhat', 'desaturated', 'look', 'especially', 'when', 'character', 'played', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'introduced', 'other', 'track', 'men', 'including', 'Denzel', 'character', 'point', 'color', 'grading', 'amped', 'very', 'not', 'overly', 'warm', 'hue', 'Mbps', 'appeared', 'average', 'low', 'mid', 'thirties', 'Video', 'here', 'really', 'what', 'hope', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'will', 'look', 'like.AUDIO', 'audio', 'DTS', 'HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'lossless', 'audio', 'always', 'big', 'difference', 'book', 'Dialogue', 'always', 'easy', 'understand', ""n't"", 'do', 'battle', 'music', 'score', 'foley', 'effects', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'amount', 'tracking', 'front', 'stage', 'rear', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'aware', 'discreet', 'directionality', 'audio', 'are', 'fully', 'encompassing', 'sound', 'stages', 'LFE', 'channel', 'will', 'be', 'working', 'almost', 'entire', 'film', 'bottom', 'end', ""n't"", 'reach', 'deepest', 'Hz', 'fully', 'present', 'speeding', 'train', 'would', 'demand.EXTRAS', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'advertisements', 'value', 'digital', 'copy', 'two', 'previews', 'other', 'films', 'having', 'pay', 'ads', 'when', 'money', 'should', 'go', 'even', 'less', 'compression', 'even', 'better', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'Also', 'typical', 'commentaries', 'doc', 'making', 'feature', 'few', 'stunts', 'are', 'extended', 'cuts', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'usually', 'like', 'see', 'digital', 'copy', 'separate', 'disc', 'wonderful', 'easy', 'install', 'transfer', 'computer', 'other', 'gizmos', 'heck', 'lot', 'better', 'having', 'deal', 'UltraViolet', 'others', 'type.All', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'exciting', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'do', 'recommend', 'get', 'quality', 'disc', 'very', 'good', '5', 'stars', 'gave', 'refer', 'quality', 'not', 'how', 'much', 'did', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'film.All', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'transfers', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'video', 'audio', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'decisions', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'type', 'review.Thanks', 'reading']",N/A

The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 used a train as a setting, but Scott goes a step further in Unstoppable, making a train one of the movies' stars. Trains are big. Scott has Washington walk in front of a few at the start of the movie to show us just how big they are.An irresponsible worker makes two mistakes that set events in motion, deciding to move a train without connecting the air brakes and then leaving the cabin to pull a lever at the side of the track. The train is moving too fast for him to get back on and pulls away under full power.Will Colson (Pine) has been a conductor for four months. He reports to work and faces resentment from the older workers. They assume he's inexperienced and think that younger, cheaper workers may be a threat to their own job security. He's assigned to work with Frank Barnes (Washington), who has similar feelings. Colson makes a couple of mistakes and Barnes thinks his fears are justified.The runaway train is initially thought to be a ""coaster,"" but it soon becomes clear that it's under power and capable of traveling at approximately 70 mph. An early effort to board it fails, so a decision has to be made. Yard Master Connie Hooper (Dawson) suggests derailing it before it reaches populated areas. Her bosses disagree because they are worried about the financial cost.Various other attempts fail to stop the train and it's left to our heroes, Barnes and Colson, to try their own solution. They give chase in their train and plan to link up with the runaway and use their own brakes to stop it.Other factors are also thrown into the mix. A group of children on a school trip are on a train on the same line as the runaway and the threat of a collision is high. The runaway is pulling half a mile of freight cars and several contain volatile chemicals. The track leads to a curve which has a speed limit of 15 mph and it's close to a heavily populated town.Just enough time is given to establishing the back stories of Barnes and Colson and it explains their motivations for chasing down the runaway. The tension builds throughout the second half of the movie and the action rarely allows us to take a breather. Failed attempts early in the story show us that our heroes are in danger if they continue the pursuit, but the alternative is a potentially huge disaster should the train derail.The story doesn't sound very complicated and it isn't. The action takes center stage, but what did you expect? I found myself engaged throughout and the three main actors put in good performances. I'm rarely disappointed by Washington and I also liked Pine and Dawson here.Video Quality 4.5/5Unstoppable looks good on Blu-ray. Scott seems to have made some of the colors unnaturally bright, making everything stand out. The train in particular looks imposing with its red and yellow paintwork. Detail is excellent throughout and the print is clean. It felt like most of the action was taking place right in front of me.Audio Quality 5/5Nominated for a sound editing Oscar, Unstoppable sounds great too. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix places us in the middle of the action. Trains aren't just big, they're heavy. The track makes us aware of that with a pounding rumble that will give your sub a good workout. It's backed up by the squeal of brakes and metal-on-metal. Dialogue comes across clearly and there's plenty of supporting effects from the rears.Special Features 3.5/5The special features focus heavily on the technical aspects of making the movie. Scott goes into detail about how he likes shots to be real rather than CGI. They include:Audio Commentary with Tony Scott.Tracking the Story: Unstoppable Script Development with Scott and writer Mark Bomback.The Fastest Track: Unleashing Unstoppable (30 minutes)Derailed: Anatomy of a Scene (10 minutes)Hanging Off the Train: Stunt Work (14 minutes)On the Rails with the Director and Cast (13 minutes)TrailerSneak PeaksBD Live: Feeling the Heat - Unstoppable Pyrotechnics (3 minutes)IMDb Live LookupDigital CopyOverall score 4/5Action movies can be dumb and full of clumsy exposition, but Unstoppable isn't one of those movies.

Florio,"[1, 4]","This is a personal quirk of mine but if a cinematic technique is used repeatedly to the point of annoyance, it dilutes the enjoyment factor.The first technique is color filter overuse, which I first noticed in Man On Fire and had that same yellowish tint.  This can be overlooked and just accepted. What made this movie totally annoying to the point of anger was that every shot during the action sequences was handheld and all over the place.  A car gets crashed into and it's hard to see because the camera is purposely shakey (to make things look raw and real, perhaps?).  But even that I've seen in other movies before.But what I found particularly aggravating was that almost every other shot, no matter what the duration, had an unnecessary quick zoom in or quick zoom out or both.  It became such a distraction and annoyance that it took me totally out of the movie to the point where I was verbally tallying each one.  I'd seen quick zooms in the Death Race and Get Carter remakes (on the drivers in the cars) that looked ridiculous. In Unstoppable, it was all over the place.  If there was a reason for it, that's something else entirely.  But in this movie, there were zooms for absolutely no reason other than the director and director of photography wanted to establish a look and a feel.  To this particular viewer, that feeling was annoyance and anger.Anyway, I found the technique so distracting that it killed any enjoyment.  Minus these techniques, I would probably give this movie three stars because it is a decent action movie if one doesn't dissect implausabilities in the plot.  Movies featuring juggernauts are always impressive.But to those who think I'm off the mark, the next time you watch Unstoppable, verbally mark each time there is a short zoom in/out and I guarantee you will be surprised how many there are.  Obviously those who didn't notice had gotten so caught up in the story.  I guarantee that once you consciously call out the first three examples (which could well be seen in a span of ten seconds or less), you'll notice its abuse throughout the movie.",1,I found this movie unwatchable.,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,2093,"['personal', 'quirk', 'mine', 'cinematic', 'technique', 'used', 'repeatedly', 'point', 'annoyance', 'enjoyment', 'factor.The', 'first', 'technique', 'color', 'filter', 'overuse', 'first', 'noticed', 'Man', 'Fire', 'had', 'same', 'yellowish', 'tint', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'just', 'accepted', 'What', 'made', 'movie', 'totally', 'annoying', 'point', 'anger', 'was', 'shot', 'action', 'sequences', 'was', 'handheld', 'place', 'car', 'crashed', 'hard', 'see', 'camera', 'purposely', 'shakey', 'make', 'things', 'look', 'raw', 'real', 'perhaps', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'before.But', 'what', 'found', 'particularly', 'aggravating', 'was', 'almost', 'other', 'shot', 'matter', 'what', 'duration', 'had', 'unnecessary', 'quick', 'zoom', 'quick', 'zoom', 'became', 'such', 'distraction', 'annoyance', 'took', 'totally', 'movie', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'verbally', 'tallying', 'one', ""'d"", 'seen', 'quick', 'zooms', 'Death', 'Race', 'Get', 'Carter', 'remakes', 'drivers', 'cars', 'looked', 'ridiculous', 'Unstoppable', 'was', 'place', 'was', 'reason', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'movie', 'were', 'zooms', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'other', 'director', 'director', 'photography', 'wanted', 'establish', 'look', 'feel', 'particular', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'was', 'annoyance', 'anger.Anyway', 'found', 'technique', 'so', 'distracting', 'killed', 'enjoyment', 'Minus', 'techniques', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'decent', 'action', 'movie', 'one', ""n't"", 'dissect', 'implausabilities', 'plot', 'Movies', 'featuring', 'juggernauts', 'are', 'always', 'impressive.But', 'who', 'think', ""'m"", 'mark', 'next', 'time', 'watch', 'Unstoppable', 'verbally', 'mark', 'time', 'short', 'zoom', 'in/out', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'many', 'are', 'Obviously', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'had', 'gotten', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'guarantee', 'once', 'consciously', 'call', 'out', 'first', 'three', 'examples', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'seen', 'span', 'ten', 'seconds', 'less', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'abuse', 'movie']",N/A

Well, ALMOST EVERYTHING! The characters are stock, cardboard cutouts with little personality. The dialogue is painfully schmaltzy and overdramatic. Tony Scott's directing is ALL OVER the place, complete with unnecessary flashing, goofy zoom-ins, and a bit of shakey-cam thrown in for bad measure. Admittedly however, his work isn't quite as bad as that on the ""Pelham 1, 2, 3"" remake. Oh, and how many cliches? Dad with estranged daughters? Check. Guy with estranged girlfriend who will seek redemption by risking his life? Check. The big business mogul who cares on about the company's losses and not those of innocent people? Check. A corny high-fiving ending? Double check.On the upside, I did like the stuntwork and action sequences. They were pretty well-staged and genuinely intense. Also, I liked how practical FX were primarily used; no CGI here folks, we actually a train crashing through stuff and real, on-camera helicopters chasing it down with real stuntmen hanging from the choppers.

Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.----------------------------------------**Brief Review**I actually remember this happening years ago when I was in the 9th grade.  We were discussing it in class.  This happened roughly 10 years before the film 'Unstoppable' hit theaters.  I am not sure how accurate the movie is to the real life event, probably a LITTLE amped up.  Still, a runaway train is a runaway train, and that's BAD no matter how you slice it.This film is EXTREMELY simple in it's story.  The fat brother from 'My Name Is Earl' jumps off a moving train to re-align some tracks, then he's too out of shape to get back on it.  It takes off down the tracks, un-maned and picking up speed with every mile.Enter Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, Denzel's the veteran conductor and Pine is the new recruit starting his first day.  Both are fated to be the ones to try and stop this moving monster before it destroys an entire town.As I said the story is pretty simple.  But a simple story is NOT a bad thing.  Sometimes a good action movie is just what the doctor ordered.  Sometimes a more character/story driven film such as 'The King's Speech' is needed.  FYI, I just saw 'The King's Speech' and it definitely lived up to the all the hype I've heard.Long story short...Denzel and Chris stop the train, minimal deaths, minimal damage.  I have an especially soft spot for this film.  Back when I managed the video store, I must have listened to this thing play like 50 times...it was good to listen to while I worked.--To Buy Or Not To Buy?--Big question, should you buy this?  If the price is 8 bucks and below, pop on this.  Any higher and I would say pass.  There are no extras, just the action packed film.  I bought mine for 4.99 (used) and would recommend you shoot for this range.  While this is a good film, it's not worth a fortune.  You could always stream it or rent it as well I guess...it may be on network tv soon as well.Well that's my 2 cents worth.

1313878,A1HZO7X76GZF32,B002ZG99TA,"Tomtastic ""Tomtastic""","[0, 0]","Unstoppable - Review of the final Tony Scott FilmTo put it bluntly, if Unstoppable were filmed by any other director the result would have been abysmal. Tony Scott draws upon his 20 plus years of directing to take this project to the big screen. His demanding requirements of what goes into his films, his use of camera angles and wide angle shots, the lack of any unnecessary CGI to give the viewer that sense of up close realism that has been absent in most films since the late 90's, make Unstoppable a movie to enjoy, not debate who's going to get the Oscar for this or that.No one's winning any races or defending the friendly skies over the Atlantic, you're not going to hear bullets whizzing past you or someone yelling from the submarine command center ""Dive! Dive! Dive!"" . You won't find any catchy one-liners either. The action is more controlled, centered, human. It's a reality movie but with all the appeal of a big budget action movie.The villain isn't a corrupt Big Brother watching from above in high definition, the villain isn't even a person, it's an unstoppable force with a mind of its own: a multi million pound train. Unstoppable is a true roller coaster ride all the way. It has character from Denzel Washington giving his 5th and final appearance in Scott's film legacy since 1995's Crimson Tide and Chris Pine teaming up with a very believable performance. They're the heroes of Unstoppable as they're top billed, but they're not supermen. They don't perform any miracle maneuvers in mid air while emptying two clips and reloading before hitting the ground. They're saving the day by doing what their characters were meant to do: their jobs. The film is based on real events and it's not going to bend reality so much as to have your head in a knot. You understand the characters, you can relate, you know their weaknesses and they're played against them to overcome not just the main obstacle but their own evils.Unstoppable is a film that shows you everyday people going beyond their required duty to save the day. One of the best parts in the film is when they're told not to do anything and even threatened to be fired if they don't stop what they're doing. The antagonistic CEO asks him why he would risk his life when he's three weeks from retirement and it doesn't really hit you what this movie was about until then.Forget about someone doing the impossible and nick of the moment acrobatics that get most movie goers raving and drooling for endless action and violence that is prevalent in most movies, this feature has none of it. It's about someone doing what they can because they were never asked to and because they know they must. Unstoppable was believable. Tony Scott gave us a final film from the heart, not something that will go down as the highest grossing blockbuster of all time, but as a true character piece, a visually captive approach to filmmaking and an inspiration to anyone out there who wonders what true heroes are.They're not men of steel and dressed in capes, they're the ones who never give a thought to their own safety before diving in head first and ensuring someone else's and they could just as likely be you or me. And when they finally save the day you feel great, emotional, enriched with appreciation for these average Joes that remind us of Uncle Jack that used to work for Union Pacific for 25 years or maybe that friend of Steve who went out of his way that time back in '89 and saved some folks from harm. It gets you right in the heart and sticks.Unstoppable is the last of Tony Scott's films and it rests comfortably at the end of his credits. He mentions in the special features that he's really making the same movie over and over each time, each time a little different but in a lot of ways they're the same, crafted from the same piece of clay or block of ice. I think I know what he means. He left his heart and soul in them and if you want to know what Tony Scott was all about, just give one of his films a try.Final ThoughtsSo we're left with a mystery as to why he took his life and it's likely that we'll never know the reason. I only hope he was satisfied with his work because I know I really enjoyed his movies over the years. I remember Top Gun and Days of Thunder the most. What I think I like the most about his films is how many times I can re-watch them and enjoy them the same each time. A lot of his films are that way. They had it all. He didn't make spectacular movies, he made great movies. The ones you can just watch for fun.""Tower, this is Ghost Rider requesting a flyby.

1313884,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002ZG99TA,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","Tony Scott's latest film ""Unstoppable"" is exactly about what the title describes: a runaway freight train with highly toxic materials. Because of several human errors, themselves simple, no one is on board to stop the train, and ""dead man's switch"" is of no use. As Rosario Dawson's yardmaster says, the worst scenario is ""a missile the size of the Chrysler Building."" The only hope to evade the catastrophe is a veteran driver Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and a newly-hired guard Will Colson (Chris Pine).The story, inspired by the real-life event in 2001 Ohio, is simple, and it works. This is a non-stop ride of action from start to finish. Tony Scott's trademark fast-cut visual style and fast-paced narrative captures the deadly power and speed of the rushing train, greatly supported by the impressive stunt work. To create tension, the film does not rely on CGI effects overused these days. The film shows what it is being ""unstoppable.""""Unstoppable"" is not without flaws. For all the strong acting from the leading actors, characters (especially those who make wrong decisions) tend to be stereotypical. Action set-pieces are gripping, but I for one prefer less hectic camera work.Still this is a hugely entertaining film, plenty of action and speed that goes faster and faster as the film's story unfolds.

My favorite of his is definitely ""Man On Fire"" great story, great emotion, and something to watch again and again. Well how does Unstoppable fair amongst Scotts best, well most are saying it's his best in years, i would have to disagree. While the story is kind of fresh with the whole runaway train deal, the plot(story) is thin and has really been done a lot before. New guy on the job(Chris Pine), gets to partner up with Veteran (Denzil Washington) for his first day of training. They exchange some small talk here and there, Denzil bosses him around a bit, Pine gets fed up tells him off by and by. Well once the Train is on its way the chaos starts, its not that it isn't ""somewhat"" tense it just seems like the train is doing all the work and making the excitement while the actors just kind of stand oddly by and watch, which what else can you do?So does this make for a big blockbuster smash that critics and fans have made it out to be, well no not really. It's a mediocre thrill ride with some good moments, and some moments of predictability. We know the company wants to derail the train but complains it will cost millions for the train company and have some potential deadly environmental effects, so we're pretty sure that won't happen. Its pretty obvious that our boys will figure out someway of stopping the train traveling at an alarming 70mph, which i didnt even know they had that capability. So whats done is done, and it gets done, i won't say how for those who haven't seen it, but in seeing the previews who do you think are the hero's at the end of the day. Pretty easy to guess. There are some good effects and the train is intimidating to watch as it has close calls with kids on a passing train, towns, plows into cars and does cause some other means of chaos. I was actually wanting more death and destruction, but hey its PG-13 and pretty plausible. So it falls somewhere in between good and ok, there is never a dull moment in the short 1:38 minutes of the film, i will give it that.
