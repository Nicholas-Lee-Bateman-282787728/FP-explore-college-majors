306603,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302306434,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","As a whole, `Rambling Rose' is a little too heavy handed, so much so that it comes off kind of hokey.  The ending is a little overdone and the character development is a little weak, but in the end I can't say that it is a waste of time or necessarily a bad film, it just doesn't warrant all the praise it has received over the years.  As an acting showcase it delivers to an extent, and as a moving period drama it works to an extent, so as an entertaining film it works to an extent.In other words; there are things to like here but not enough to really make the film complete.The film tells the story of a young woman named Rose who moves in with the Hillyer family during the 1930's.  She's a flamboyant and uncontrollable force why comes to serve as maid and housekeeper to the family in order to spare her a life of debauchery.  Her story is told through the eyes of Buddy, now an adult, who was but a young boy when Rose first moved into his home.  Rose, a very sensual and tantalizing woman, immediately takes a liking to Mr. Hillyer while young Buddy takes his own liking to Rose.  The film follows Rose and her escapades with the law and with boys and chronicles her confrontations with Mr. Hillyer over her actions.  She is a very unorthodox woman who uses her body instead of her mind to attract the attention of others, but her kind heart makes her genuine and hard to rally up against.The film sports a very fine performance by Laura Dern, who manages to make Rose a character we can not only fantasize about but also sympathize with.  She grasps Rose's sensuality without every allowing it to overshadow her genuine nature.  We see her heart before we see her body.  Robert Duvall also gives a splendid performance as the man of the house, matching Dern's nature with his rugged charm.  It's easy to see why she admires and even desires him, and it's wonderful to see him combat that desire.  Diane Ladd is highly overpraised for her performance; a performance that isn't `bad' but is far from award worthy.  Her final speech at the doctor's office is so overdone and heavy that it brings the entire film down a notch.Lukas Haas (of `Witness' fame) delivers a fine performance as the young Buddy, expressing both Buddy's budding curiosity as well as his restrained maturity.  The scenes he shares with Dern are especially excellent (albeit a tad uncomfortable).In the end though, this movie lives and dies on Dern's shoulders, and she carries it mighty fine for the most part.  Her dynamic performance cannot save the film from it's own heavy hand, but at least the movie doesn't make light of the subject; it just spills over into over-dramatizing something that should feel natural and effecting but ends up coming off more forced and unrealistic.  Dern is a gem though, and her performance alone makes the film worth seeing at least once.",3,Dern grounds the film the best she can...,1219968000,"08 29, 2008",2008,2856,"['whole', 'Rambling', 'Rose', 'little', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed', 'so', 'much', 'kind', 'hokey', 'ending', 'little', 'overdone', 'character', 'development', 'little', 'weak', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'waste', 'time', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'warrant', 'praise', 'received', 'years', 'acting', 'showcase', 'extent', 'moving', 'period', 'drama', 'extent', 'so', 'entertaining', 'film', 'extent.In', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'things', 'like', 'here', 'not', 'enough', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'complete.The', 'film', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Rose', 'who', 'Hillyer', 'family', '1930', 'flamboyant', 'uncontrollable', 'force', 'why', 'serve', 'maid', 'housekeeper', 'family', 'order', 'spare', 'life', 'debauchery', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'Buddy', 'now', 'adult', 'who', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'when', 'Rose', 'first', 'moved', 'home', 'Rose', 'very', 'sensual', 'tantalizing', 'woman', 'immediately', 'liking', 'Mr.', 'Hillyer', 'young', 'Buddy', 'own', 'liking', 'Rose', 'film', 'Rose', 'escapades', 'law', 'boys', 'confrontations', 'Mr.', 'Hillyer', 'actions', 'very', 'unorthodox', 'woman', 'who', 'body', 'instead', 'mind', 'attract', 'attention', 'others', 'kind', 'heart', 'genuine', 'hard', 'rally', 'up', 'against.The', 'film', 'sports', 'very', 'fine', 'performance', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'who', 'make', 'Rose', 'character', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'fantasize', 'also', 'sympathize', 'grasps', 'Rose', 'sensuality', 'allowing', 'overshadow', 'genuine', 'nature', 'see', 'heart', 'see', 'body', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'also', 'splendid', 'performance', 'man', 'house', 'matching', 'Dern', 'nature', 'rugged', 'charm', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'even', 'wonderful', 'see', 'combat', 'desire', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'highly', 'overpraised', 'performance', 'performance', ""n't"", 'bad', 'far', 'award', 'worthy', 'final', 'speech', 'doctor', 'office', 'so', 'overdone', 'heavy', 'entire', 'film', 'down', 'notch.Lukas', 'Haas', 'Witness', 'fame', 'fine', 'performance', 'young', 'Buddy', 'expressing', 'Buddy', 'budding', 'curiosity', 'as', 'well', 'restrained', 'maturity', 'scenes', 'shares', 'Dern', 'are', 'especially', 'excellent', 'tad', 'uncomfortable', 'end', 'movie', 'Dern', 'shoulders', 'fine', 'most', 'part', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'film', 'own', 'heavy', 'hand', 'least', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'light', 'subject', 'just', 'over', 'over-dramatizing', 'something', 'should', 'feel', 'natural', 'effecting', 'up', 'coming', 'off', 'more', 'forced', 'unrealistic', 'Dern', 'gem', 'performance', 'alone', 'film', 'seeing', 'least', 'once']",N/A

The theme of ""unbridled female sexuality"" and how it was often ""handled"" in more primitive times is unsettling, as it should be.

Again, is sex between adult and child something we want to continue to normalize in a culture that claims concern for the safety of children? Or is art beyond that kind of responsiblity?

306613,A2DSXA1E02C86D,6302306434,Joseph Haschka,"[36, 42]","Societies regard single, attractive, sexually available women with both idolization and uneasiness. The lust, envy, jealousy and otherwise tumultuous passions surrounding their passage through the populace can be disruptive of societal bonds, e.g. by ""homewrecking"", even though no fault of their own. One reason why the concept, at least, of marriage is valued so highly is that this cultural arrangement takes the problematic single female out of circulation, so to speak. And, social pressures cause opprobrium to be heaped on ""loose women"", even by the very men who are drawn to them. Of course, the feminist correctly sees these attitudes as blatantly sexist.RAMBLING ROSE takes a compassionate look at the phenomenon of social turbulence caused by an ""unattached"" woman. Rose, flamboyantly played by Laura Dern, is the blithe, single, 19-year old girl invited to live with a very proper Southern family in the mid-1930s. The family, offering Rose help at this difficult time in her life, includes Daddy (Robert Duvall), Mother (Diane Ladd, Dern's real-life mother), and 13-year old Buddy (Lukas Haas). Rose, already possessing a checkered history acquired with unspecified men, is a sexual ""free spirit"", who proceeds to cause hormonal havoc in the town's male population. Even Daddy is bewitched. To Buddy, Rose is, unsurprisingly, the godsend of a new awareness. Of the adults, only Mother, recognizing Rose as essentially guileless, staunchly defends her as the repercussions of the Siren's residence start to add up.A better film on much the same theme is Y2K's MALENA - a superb Italian production. Nonetheless, RAMBLING ROSE is delightful. Dern is positively captivating. Duvall is at his best, which is pretty darn good by any measure. Ladd portrays Mother as a slightly eccentric individual whose generosity towards and understanding of Rose is a clear counterpoint to the hardening attitudes of the other adults. The Buddy character should remind all males in the viewing audience of that time when they were 13 and discovering girls as beings with something more to offer than simply opportunities for boorish teasing.

306614,A2PKB4QEPJQY5N,6302306434,"Laura D ""opera buff""","[0, 1]","I understand what the person making this movie was trying to sympathetically impart, and because I never read the book this film was based on, I don't know how successful her interpretation is.  However, I have to say it is a very uneven movie.  It's excessively talky where people are in one scene (usually bed) ruminating over their concerns, repeatedly.  Rose tearfully begs Buddy, over and over, ""not to tell"" when some rather inappropriate petting play occurs between the 19 year old girl and the 13 year old boy.  Mother and Daddy chew over the problems and concerns of having a preternaturally libidinous girl in their home, ad infinitum.  It's as if the golden, bucolic, richly warm Southern scenery grinds to a halt as soon as people wrap themselves up in their discussions and talk, talk, talk, repeating their phrases over again, so that the audiences gets the point:  this nice genteel family has taken in a problem teenager, a ""promiscuous"" young lady from a disadvantaged home.  Okay, viewers GET it.The clothes were wrong.  Even a girl of Rose's impoverished background, in a slow-moving, possibly backward Southern town (in this case ""backward"" meaning out of step with current styles of the era), would have been more conscious of contemporary fashion, if this movie, as the blurb says, takes place in 1935.  Yet Rose is dressed like a shabby flapper of 1929, and it's not because she is down at heel and can't afford new clothes, wearing the knee-length filmy chiffon dresses and battered cloche hat which are obviously the hand-me-downs from someone who'd worn them a decade earlier.  The fact that she would dress up and go to town in blatanty out-of-style attire is totally against her character of seductively attracting attention.  Yes, she does attract attention, but in real life, no matter how sexily appealing her appearance, no girl of that age would deliberately go out in public in such out-of-date clothing to socially lure people to her.  I kept wondering what year I was watching -- Rose in her tight, skimpy, above-the- knees 1920's flapper dresses; cars ranging from tin lizzies to late 1930's models with their rounded bumpers; Daddy in his bow tie and straw fedora and buttoned vest in hot summer, also looking like someone from the previous decade; Mother's long pageboy hairstyle instead of the curled marcel wave of the mid 1930's, but with the big hats and longer skirts of circa 1935.  It was a bit confusing.  I know audiences are supposed to have a suspension of disbelief, but something setting the scene in a pastoral Southern community during the Great Depression could have been researched to look more accurate.I was less disturbed by Buddy's erotic interest in Rose than many other viewers.  Buddy wasn't a childish little boy, but a maturing (if not yet strapping) teenager with a changed voice, and 13-year-olds can be either way according to their physical development.  It's understandable that, obviously well into puberty, he would be lured by smutty ""Tijuana Bible"" sex comic books and a seductive girl in her late teens living in the house and practically throwing herself into his lap, certainly into his bed.  Of course no one should have taken advantage of the situation, but Rose does not understand what is appropriate behavior, even though she chides Buddy that ""it isn't right,"" and ""you're just a kid.""  Buddy is also very intellectually precocious, and that adds to his prurient interest in the sort of trouble Rose caused in her communnity and the fascination he has for her.I have to confess I frankly became bored with the movie after awhile, following the scene where the pompous doctor lectures Mother and Daddy about Rose and whether she ought to be -- I guess sterilized isn't the word, since she was rendered infertile in her early teens by an unattended gonnorheal infection, but somehow reduced sexually by a complete hysterectomy.  The three of them sat around sounding like musty textbooks from 80 years ago, and yet the film strongly hints in the doctor's lecherous interest in Rose for himself.  Does he or doesn't he?  It's too ambiguous.  We also don't get a character development of any of the beaux and besotted swains who vie for Rose's attention and fight over her.  Buddy, instead of being eaten apart by jealousy the way any adolescent boy living in a house with a girl like that would be, stands by observing, with a wryly amused smirk on his face.  It doesn't add up.  There just seems to be a big chunk of something missing out of all the characters -- hard of hearing Mother's own soft, unintelligible mumbling; Daddy attracted by this rowdy girl and yet constantly scolding her and worried about her; the two younger kids in the family overhearing all sorts of precocious talk in the household and giggling knowingly about it, and dryly amused Buddy with his melodramatically sadistic questions, a roue in miniature without a smidgen of typical growing-teen angst and fumbling confusion about him.  This movie just slipped out of what it was intending to portray.",3,Kind of Disappointing,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,5057,"['understand', 'what', 'person', 'making', 'movie', 'was', 'trying',

He outdoes himself here with his great humanity.  Diane Ladd is his equal as the eccentric but lovable Southern wife.  Their performances were memorable.Laura Dern, an actress I admire a lot, doesn't quite measure up to the others here, in my opinion.  Her performance is a bit too much, which tended to make me  agree with the Duvall character, after Rose's (Dern) marriage, ""Well I'm glad we finally got rid of her.""Lukas Haas was wonderful as the young teenage boy.  I always enjoy seeing John Heard, although his part is small here and he really doesn't do a very good job in the final scene.The script is not particularly memorable, but it does serve as a nice vehicle for the actors and the delicious atmosphere of the Old South.The Amazon reviewer must have been in a foul mood when he watched this film.

If Duval is there, I'll take the gamble, and no let down here. Laura Dern was delightfully over-the-top as the teenage spitfire. I was curious to see Lukas Haas in something other than Witness. He was equally great in this. Other than the cast and the blurb on the box, I had nothing to go on with this one. What a delight. I found the more the story unfolded, the more I was enjoying the ride. Simple in style, and easy on the eyes, 30's Georgia countryside, yet at times the wonderful dialogue reminded me of the screwball comedies of the late 30's and early 40's. Unquestionably Duval delivered and was charming in his Southern chivalry and hilarious in his exasperation with both the newly hired housekeeper, Dern, and with his glorious wife, Diane Ladd. Contrary to other reviews, I found Ladd's role one of the best, She plays a Columbia grad working on her Masters in American History, and whose rhetoric is dumbfounding to her devoted husband Duval, who refers to it as ""logic from the 4th dimension."" There are some wonderful scenes and exchanges. Terrific heartfelt laughs and excellent dialogue. This wasn't a superb movie, but Rambling Rose was surely, a really well acted, well written, well filmed and well edited, hot and steamy, good, good movie.",4,Boring?
