Resourceful, the film fuses together early home movies, group footage, interviews of surviving members, relatives, and loved ones, as well as interviews when they were at their apex. Also featured are thoughtful words by Bono and short reflections by John Cusack, Martin Scorsese, and Steve Buscemi. All of the posthumous interviews are done by a bonfire to allude to Strummer's illustrated vision of heaven on earth. The highlights, however, focus on casual and candid talk by Strummer himself.  His words both spoken and sung should be final proof that punk rock isn't and wasn't primarily right wing.

1158124,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B0017WI5W0,Doug Anderson,"[4, 6]","My favorite part of this documentary is finding out about Joe Strummer's youth and how living in a number of foreign countries fostered in him a love of all kinds of music. However this is not an homage to Strummer or The Clash but rather a kind of behind-the-scenes expose of both Strummer and his band. Clash fans might be turned off by much of this, they will certainly be dismayed to find that The Clash was the brainchild not of Strummer but of a Malcolm McLaren-like manager named Bernie who introduced Strummer to Jones and Simenon. In the unwritten history of English music there is Before the Sex Pistols (BSP) and After the Sex Pistols (ASP) and Strummer lived on both sides of this cultural divide. On the one hand Strummer was an art school hippie with folksie roots (early on he called himself ""Woody"") and on the other he was a conniving opportunist and commercial strategist who valued fame more than friendship (when punk and Bernie's offer to be a part of it came along he abandoned his hippie community).  So Strummer is a man divided from the beginning and the difficulties that he had both within The Clash and afterwards stem from an inability to resolve this identity clash. No one doubts that Strummer was an important musical voice (maybe The Voice of 1977) but those early Clash songs like ""White Riot"" are the product of both the folksy freedom fighter and the ambitious commercial strategist and the balance between these two Joes was always precarious at best. Once the ambitious strategist lost touch with the freedom fighter The Clash was doomed. Even though the Joe Strummer-Mick Jones battle was played out in public it seems that the real battle being fought on Combat Rock was a battle between the two Joes: the one who wanted to speak to the world and the one who found that once the world started listening he had very little left to say or reason for saying it.After The Clash disbanded it took Strummer many years to rediscover his folksy roots and self. But the last chapter of the Joe Strummer story is a relatively satisfying one as rock bios go as he did finally find a way to reconnect those two warring halves when he formed The Mescaleros. In that band he could be both Joe the folksy hippie world musician and Joe the punk rock star.Julien Temple's exquisite selection and arrangment of period footage and data makes this a visually, psychologically, and culturally rich experience and the inclusion of tapes from Joe Strummer's radio show in which Joe offers commentary on the artists and songs that he plays is rich and informative. But the inclusion of Johnny Depp (with ridiculous eyeliner and braided beard and head wrap) was a bad idea. Johnny the actor is fine but Johhny the actor as wannabe rocker is the opposite of folk and punk and all things authentic.",5,The Two Joe Strummers,1228953600,"12 11, 2008",2008,2811,"['favorite', 'part', 'documentary', 'finding', 'out', 'Joe', 'Strummer', 'youth', 'how', 'living', 'number', 'foreign', 'countries', 'fostered', 'love', 'kinds', 'music', 'However', 'not', 'homage', 'Strummer', 'Clash', 'rather', 'kind', 'behind-the-scenes', 'expose', 'Strummer', 'band', 'Clash', 'fans', 'might', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'much', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'dismayed', 'find', 'Clash', 'was', 'brainchild', 'not', 'Strummer', 'Malcolm', 'McLaren-like', 'manager', 'named', 'Bernie', 'who', 'introduced', 'Strummer', 'Jones', 'Simenon', 'unwritten', 'history', 'English', 'music', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'BSP', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'ASP', 'Strummer', 'lived', 'sides', 'cultural', 'divide', 'one', 'hand', 'Strummer', 'was', 'art', 'school', 'hippie', 'folksie', 'roots', 'early', 'called', 'Woody', 'other', 'was', 'conniving', 'opportunist', 'commercial', 'strategist', 'who', 'valued', 'fame', 'more', 'friendship', 'when', 'punk', 'Bernie', 'offer', 'be', 'part', 'came', 'along', 'abandoned', 'hippie', 'community', 'So', 'Strummer', 'man', 'divided', 'beginning', 'difficulties', 'had', 'Clash', 'afterwards', 'stem', 'inability', 'resolve', 'identity', 'clash', 'one', 'Strummer', 'was', 'important', 'musical', 'voice', 'maybe', 'Voice', '1977', 'early', 'Clash', 'songs', 'White', 'Riot', 'are', 'product', 'folksy', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'ambitious', 'commercial', 'strategist', 'balance', 'two', 'Joes', 'was', 'always', 'precarious', 'best', 'Once', 'ambitious', 'strategist', 'lost', 'touch', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'Clash', 'was', 'doomed', 'Even', 'Joe', 'Strummer-Mick', 'Jones', 'battle', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'public', 'real', 'battle', 'being', 'fought', 'Combat', 'Rock', 'was', 'battle', 'two', 'Joes', 'one', 'who', 'wanted', 'speak', 'world', 'one', 'who', 'found', 'once', 'world', 'started', 'listening', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'left', 'say', 'reason', 'saying', 'it.After', 'Clash', 'disbanded', 'took', 'Strummer', 'many', 'years', 'rediscover', 'folksy', 'roots', 'self', 'last', 'chapter', 'Joe', 'Strummer', 'story', 'relatively', 'satisfying', 'one', 'rock', 'bios', 'go', 'did', 'finally', 'find', 'way', 'reconnect', 'two', 'warring', 'halves', 'when', 'formed', 'Mescaleros', 'band', 'could', 'be', 'Joe', 'folksy', 'hippie', 'world', 'musician', 'Joe', 'punk', 'rock', 'star.Julien', 'Temple', 'exquisite', 'selection', 'arrangment', 'period', 'footage', 'data', 'visually', 'psychologically', 'culturally', 'rich', 'experience', 'inclusion', 'tapes', 'Joe', 'Strummer', 'radio', 'show', 'Joe', 'commentary', 'artists', 'songs', 'rich', 'informative', 'inclusion', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'ridiculous', 'eyeliner', 'braided', 'beard', 'head', 'wrap', 'was', 'bad', 'idea', 'Johnny', 'actor', 'fine', 'Johhny', 'actor', 'wannabe', 'rocker', 'opposite', 'folk', 'punk', 'things', 'authentic']",N/A

In fact, this might be one of the best such productions ever made.  I only hesitate to make that claim because, being rather detail oriented, I want to research more of the information included as well as see this film a few more times before putting it on that kind of pedestal.  Still, this film humanizes Joe and his work in a way that is both respectful and honest.  It gives us a valid picture of who Joe was, and yet somehow manages to not fall into the hole of idol-worship that most music documentaries succumb to.  On all counts, those are significant accomplishments indeed.Like most musician bio-pictures, this one is comprised in large part of interviews and commentaries about Joe and by Joe.  We get to see clips of him speaking and reflecting in his own words on the success ofThe Clashas well as the ups and downs he experienced since the group broke up, both in and out of music.  You can't help but feel a certain closeness to Joe's life that was not easily obtained from the books and movies that were made before this one.  And you can't help but feel happy for Joe that he was able to get back out of the shadows and start performing live again after all those years.  After all, if it weren't for Joe bands likeGreen Dayprobably would have never existed if not for him and The Clash.One key difference however, is that some of the stylized narration that is normal for such features has been intelligently pared down to a minimum.  They also seem to have done an excellent job in choosing great clips and editing them in such a way that even the random thoughts and opinions of the many interviewees flow extremely well.  So not only is this watchable, but you are bound to gain at least some small insight you didn't have before watching.  And that applies to the general music fan just as much as it does to the hardcore fan of Joe and his work.Definitely give this documentary top billing and rent it or buy it soon.

We all have our memories of Joe, and that collective, communal spirit is a major point in Julien Temple's documentary.  You'll see dozens of folks interspersed throughout the piece, each giving remembrances around campfires.  Interestingly, no one is identified via subtitle on screen, so you'll see everyone from Zander Schloss to Johnny Depp if you pay attention (doubtlessly part of the 1-world, human feeling the movie goes to great lengths to portray, from the best of us to the least of us we are all in this together.)  The haunting quality of Joe's voice doing the primary voice-over narration for the entirety of the film is palpable.  And fortunately Temple has unearthed scads of rare, quality footage including home movies, TV interviews, and even reel-to-reel from Joe's squatting days, which means we're not dealing with the same warmed-over Westway footage for the umpteenth time.  The whole film is tremendously rich, crackling with energy & vitality, but also comfortable.  This is the remembrance we've wanted (needed?) since the night he left, and for me it erases the bad taste of a dozen soulless cash-in ""documentaries"" that have been forced upon us over the intervening years.  It's a fitting coda to Joe's life: not maudlin, not excessively mournful, not ridiculously celebratory.

1158132,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0017WI5W0,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 7]","On December 22, 2002, at the ripe young age of 50, John Graham Mellor - better known as Joe Strummer, co-founder, lyricist, rhythm guitarist and lead singer for the group The Clash - died, rather prosaically, of a heart attack.  I say ""prosaically"" because one would reasonably have envisioned a somewhat more ""exotic"" and ""respectable"" end for a punk rock artist of Joe Strummer`s caliber.  Yet, perhaps it's not quite so strange after all, for like many of his musical contemporaries, Strummer lived his life in the fast lane, perhaps burning so intensely for such a brief period of time that his battered and overstretched heart simply couldn`t keep up with all the demands placed on it after awhile (actually, we`re told he suffered from a congenital heart condition of which he had no knowledge and which could have taken his life at any time).Whatever the cause of his demise, the documentary ""Joe Strummer:  The Future is Unwritten"" provides a compelling and really quite exhaustive look into the life and career of this punk music legend.  The movie starts at the beginning with Mellor's birth in Ankara, Turkey, to a father who was a British diplomat and a mother who was a nurse.  He had a generally unhappy childhood, being whisked from one country to another before  eventually being deposited in a British boarding school, seeing very little of his parents during the seven year period in which they were living abroad.The movie then goes on to chronicle the death of his older brother by suicide; Mellor's enrollment in art college (where he changed his name to Woody and formed his first band, The Vultures); his time living as a squator in some abandoned row houses in West London with a group of fellow musicians with whom he formed his second band, the 101's; and his eventual turning away from Rockabilly and towards punk when The Sex Pistols opened for his group one night and forever altered Mellor's view of what music could be and do.  By this time he had already changed his name a second time - now he was to be known as Joe Strummer - and had become extremely adept at writing lyrics and playing rhythm guitar.It was at this point in 1976 that he essentially abandoned his former friends and hooked up with Mick Jones, Paul Simonon and Nicky Headon to form the band The Clash.  The film then records the rise of that group, emphasizing the driving energy and social commentary of its music, as Strummer, through his lyrics, boldly took on the political and military establishment, decrying civil injustice and examining the very nature of authority itself.  In fact, the movie makes it clear that the punk movement itself represented a revolt not just against society as a whole but against previous styles of music and fashion - and even one's old friends and way of life, including, in Strummer's case, his pre-Clash band mates, many of whom agreed to be interviewed for this film.In the latter stages, the movie explores the paradox of success and celebrity, especially for performers who base their art on railing against the very things they find themselves endorsing in the end:  namely, conformity, commercialism, fame and self-indulgence.  For The Clash this was exemplified by the ""sellouts"" of going to America, of achieving international acclaim with their 1979 album ""London Calling,"" and of writing ""hit"" songs (most notably, of course, ""Rock the Casbah"").  This accelerating artistic ambiguity led to increased personal tension among the members of the band and the eventual dissolution of the group.  Towards the end of his life, Joe turned to marriage and fatherhood and a career in the film industry both as an actor and a composer.  But any attempt to revive his career as a singer, at least at first, ended in failure - some would suggest a failure largely calculated and imposed by the man himself.  Yet, in his final years, a much more tranquil and mellow Joe began to emerge, managing to make ""peace"" between the hippies and the punkers by establishing outdoor music fests - affectionately labeled ""Joe's Campfires"" - to help bridge the gap.  And, as an appropriate finale to his life, he embarked on a well-received tour with his last band, The Mescaleros.Director Julien Temple has put together a surprisingly dense and visually imaginative film, one that is heavily reflective of the turbulent times in which it is set.  In addition to interviews with former lovers and friends of Strummer, the movie provides generous helpings of file footage and home movies, as well as clips from films like ""If...,"" ""Animal Farm,"" ""1984,"" etc. whose subject matters parallel elements of Joe's life and the era in which he lived.  Temple also frequently interjects into the narrative animated versions of cartoons Joe himself drew over the years.  Moreover, a number of familiar faces - Bono, Matt Dillon, Steve Buscemi, John Cusack, Jim Jarmusch, Courtney Love (who appeared with Strummer in the movie ""Straight to Hell""), even Johnny Depp in full Jack Sparrow regalia - stop by to throw their two-cents-worth in as to how profoundly they were influenced by Joe and the music of the Clash.  And, of course, above it all there is the music...But the true coup here is getting Joe himself to comment posthumously on his own life, thanks to the ready availability of interviews he gave at crucial moments during his career.  This allows us to hear the man relate his own story in his own words.  It may be a story that ends sadly, but not before Joe seems to find some genuine peace in his life.

Julian Temple's great documentary on the late Clashman, THE FUTURE IS UNWRITTEN provides a great look into the life of brilliant, if troubled vocalist.Combining reminisces from former compatriots, interviews and great live footage from the Clash's glory day, the film does a great job of showing what forces formed Joe's musical vision and his deep integrity.  It also does not shy away from showing the troubles that haunted his life and career.  It's a sad irony that Strummer's life ended just as he seemed to be beginning to hit his stride again.Any fan of the Clash, or even Joe's solo career would be well advised to at least invest the time to watch this touching documentary.",5,The Future is Unwritten: Great Flick,1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,765,"['who', 'loved', 'Clash', 'Joe', 'Strummer', 'really', 'was', 'hero', 'age', 'none', 'Julian', 'Temple', 'great', 'documentary', 'late', 'Clashman', 'THE', 'FUTURE', 'IS', 'UNWRITTEN', 'great', 'look', 'life', 'brilliant', 'troubled', 'vocalist.Combining', 'reminisces', 'former', 'compatriots', 'interviews', 'great', 'live', 'footage', 'Clash', 'glory', 'day', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'what', 'forces', 'formed', 'Joe', 'musical', 'vision', 'deep', 'integrity', 'also', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'showing', 'troubles', 'haunted', 'life', 'career', 'sad', 'irony', 'Strummer', 'life', 'ended', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'beginning', 'hit', 'stride', 'again.Any', 'fan', 'Clash', 'even', 'Joe', 'solo', 'career', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'advised', 'least', 'invest', 'time', 'watch', 'touching', 'documentary']",N/A

The film also depresses the viewer by detailing Strummer's post-Clash life, which was a long slide into obscurity.

However, this documentary is NOT it. This documentary is filled with nonsense video imagery that has nothing to do with Joe Strummer. It's like watching an old episode of the classic ABC Saturday morning TV show, ""Make a Wish"", where they talk about a subject and show lots of cutting room visuals that meander in and out to follow the narration. This documentary consists of Joe's friends sitting in front of a cmmpfire and talking about Joe, while scrap film from the cutting room floor is used to ""illustrate"" their comments. If they talk about Joe being born in Turkey, the film shows some old footage of Turkey; they mention one of Joes friends named Woody, and then they show footage of Woody Guthrie. WTF???
