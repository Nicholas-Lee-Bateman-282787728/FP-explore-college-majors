What I really like about it was that it really showed how love isn't just surface, based entirely on looks and perfection.  It really showed the connection between the characters that eventually lead to a fondness better known as &#34;love&#34;.  Some people might say &#34;I can't see how they fell in love when they were arguing all the time&#34; I say, if you watch the movie with a critical eye, you get a chance to see that love is about accepting someone for who they are including their imperfections.

Then, SunWorld Pictures offers a clean, Dove approved tale with a predictable but well made modern remake of the classic.  And you really get two Beasts in this one.Isabelle the spoiled orphan, socialite, party girl whose rich uncle provides for her from her deceased parent's trust fund is unlikable even to herself.  She takes a ski trip, insults her not as-glamorous-looking friend and finds herself injured and isolated at the mercy of a mystery man living solo in a romantic cabin far from civilized contact.  Wow, a perfect romance novel.  Of course, the at odds relationship draws us, and we know where this is headed, but it's a relaxing, fun journey to enjoy.SunWorld produces these kind of movies, e.g., Civil Love(directed also by Bryan Carzan)- a Civil War romance, Scents and Sensibility- a modern Jane Austen romantic comedy and others. The outdoor settings are beautiful, the actors do a fine enough job, although the characterizations and story can be a little overdone at times; the music, editing and general production values are good.They provide for a genre featuring a simple moral tale with romance, comedy, happy endings, a family friendly film(but little kids will be bored), and a touch of spirituality, e.g., praying or asking God for help or forgiveness. These may not appeal to some for being insipid, moralizing and too predictable.

1668360,A3LNU3T5H9OMWC,B00EOHGQPI,P. Romance,"[33, 34]","3.5 StarsIsabelle was a spoil debutante, who only care where the next party was located.  When a skiing accident had her injured in the middle of the wintry forest, Isabelle began to wonder where her life went wrong.  Stumbling along, she found herself at Jeremy's secluded cabin.  Forcing him to help her, she made herself at home.  Jeremy was not happy with the little arrangement and was determined to take this princess down a notch or two.  But their forced closeness began to stir something that they both have forgotten.  Will they discover that love can overcome all before the two weeks were up?So, what happens when Beauty is the Beast?  You get this movie.  This was not the Beauty we're used to. Instead of being a nice, caring person we've come to expect, our heroine was a spoiled, rich socialite who preferred partying than helping others.  Overall, the acting was done very well.  Not over the top.  Isabelle, played by Shona Kay, was perfectly irritating.  Jeremy, played by Brad Johnson, was majorly cute and I formed more of an affinity with Jeremy's character than Isabella's.  Their chemistry was not off the charts, but enough to make you believe that they were falling in love.  Some of their scenes were giggle-worthy.The movie basically played out like a romance novel.  It was cliche and predictable.  Which was awesome for me since I love my romances.  However, for those expecting something new, you will be very disappointed.  The plot was a little on the slow side.  As a book, I would've enjoyed it more.  But as a movie, not as much.  Nothing much happened.  For 70% of the time, it was more of Isabella discovering what happiness really meant by secluding herself in this cabin for two weeks with someone who didn't give in to every whim.  I did like the way the movie handled her transformation though.  Overall, it was a clean movie, except for a few kissing scenes.  I'm guessing the Dove.org 12+ seal was probably for some of the mature topics.  However, it wasn't anything you don't normally see on TV these days.  Other than that, there was nothing else I found objectionable.  For the few, there were some Christian elements near the end of the movie.Beauty and the Beast is and will always be my favorite fairy tale.  ""A Beautiful Beast"" took enough elements from the Disney's version to see the correlation and satisfy fairy tale fans.  If you generally like gentle romances, this is definitely the movie for you.  Mind you, the plot is predictable with a smidge of drama.  And if you are a person who needs something unique and different, please pass this one by.  So, depending on your mood, this will be a movie will be a hit or miss.  Overall, I was excited to watch it once.  However, I think once was enough for me.Note: English language with English subtitles only.",4,When Beauty is the Beast . . .,1382486400,"10 23, 2013",2013,2814,"['3.5', 'StarsIsabelle', 'was', 'spoil', 'debutante', 'who', 'only', 'care', 'where', 'next', 'party', 'was', 'located', 'When', 'skiing', 'accident', 'had', 'injured', 'middle', 'wintry', 'forest', 'Isabelle', 'began', 'wonder', 'where', 'life', 'went', 'wrong', 'Stumbling', 'along', 'found', 'Jeremy', 'secluded', 'cabin', 'Forcing', 'help', 'made', 'home', 'Jeremy', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'little', 'arrangement', 'was', 'determined', 'take', 'princess', 'down', 'notch', 'two', 'forced', 'closeness', 'began', 'stir', 'something', 'have', 'forgotten', 'Will', 'discover', 'love', 'can', 'overcome', 'two', 'weeks', 'were', 'up', 'So', 'what', 'when', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'get', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'Beauty', ""'re"", 'used', 'Instead', 'being', 'nice', 'caring', 'person', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'heroine', 'was', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'socialite', 'who', 'preferred', 'partying', 'helping', 'others', 'Overall', 'acting', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'Not', 'top', 'Isabelle', 'played', 'Shona', 'Kay', 'was', 'perfectly', 'irritating', 'Jeremy', 'played', 'Brad', 'Johnson', 'was', 'majorly', 'cute', 'formed', 'more', 'affinity', 'Jeremy', 'character', 'Isabella', 'chemistry', 'was', 'not', 'charts', 'enough', 'make', 'believe', 'were', 'falling', 'love', 'scenes', 'were', 'giggle-worthy.The', 'movie', 'basically', 'played', 'out', 'romance', 'novel', 'was', 'cliche', 'predictable', 'Which', 'was', 'awesome', 'love', 'romances', 'However', 'expecting', 'something', 'new', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'plot', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'side', 'book', 'would', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'more', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'Nothing', 'much', 'happened', '70', '%', 'time', 'was', 'more', 'Isabella', 'discovering', 'what', 'happiness', 'really', 'meant', 'secluding', 'cabin', 'two', 'weeks', 'someone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'whim', 'did', 'way', 'movie', 'handled', 'transformation', 'Overall', 'was', 'clean', 'movie', 'few', 'kissing', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Dove.org', '12+', 'seal', 'was', 'probably', 'mature', 'topics', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'see', 'TV', 'days', 'Other', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'found', 'objectionable', 'few', 'were', 'Christian', 'elements', 'end', 'movie.Beauty', 'Beast', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'favorite', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Beautiful', 'Beast', 'took', 'enough', 'elements', 'Disney', 'version', 'see', 'correlation', 'satisfy', 'fairy', 'tale', 'fans', 'generally', 'like', 'gentle', 'romances', 'definitely', 'movie', 'Mind', 'plot', 'predictable', 'smidge', 'drama', 'are', 'person', 'who', 'something', 'unique', 'different', 'please', 'pass', 'one', 'So', 'depending', 'mood', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'hit', 'miss', 'Overall', 'was', 'excited', 'watch', 'once', 'However', 'think', 'once', 'was', 'enough', 'me.Note', 'English', 'language', 'English', 'subtitles', 'only']",The Beautiful Beast

In addition it makes the point that money alone does not bring happiness but caring about others is what it is all about.The character of Isabelle Elliott (Shona Kay) is the perfect example of a spoiled rich girl who is now an adult. Her rich uncle spoiled her but the trustees of her will are encouraging him to cut her off until she shows some maturity. When she spontaneously flies to Switzerland with her friend Catherine (Melanie Gardner) she goes skiing and then following an argument sends Catherine away from the snowy place they are at.Isabelle falls, hurts herself, and wanders off before becoming lost. She stumbles upon a cabin and a man named Jeremy (Brad Johnson). She insists he helps her and against his wishes he does, feeling some compassion for her. They clash immediately and he calls her self-centered.She is used to people catering to her every whim and Jeremy is unlike anyone she has ever met. Conversely, he is hiding from his past, which features a medical tragedy, and she helps him face up to it. These 2 oddballs find they have more in common than they initially thought and the romantic question becomes if they will become a couple and, even more appropriately, a couple that has a future together.We are awarding this terrific movie which features forgiveness five Doves, our best rating. We are recommending it for ages twelve plus. This is a good one for couples to watch together.
