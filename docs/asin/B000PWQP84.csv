Everytime something was explained another quandry developed, it was a a very enjoyable thriller with infinate plot twists, and even after the final fade I waited for a final twist. Probally  the most enjoyable film I have seen in a long time primarily due to Jolene Blalock, she is a stunning lady, and her entire wardrobe for the film couldn't have cost more than $10.00 at WalMart.

Shadow Puppets.What we have here is a small group of people who are all stuck in a strange place with no memory of who they are and why they are there.Members of the group include James Marsters from Buffy and Angel as well as Jolene Blalock from Enterprise, not to mention My good friend Tony Todd and I can't forget the lovely Natasha Alam who decides to strip down to her...nakedness and go for a swim despite the fact that she knows that she is in eminent danger but I can't hold that against her.Now what I didn't mention before that cast rant was the fact that while our group is trying to figure out what is gong on hey are being chased by a gialn black shadow creature that can stab them and eat them alive. I'm honestly trying to figure out what the hell that thing was. The unfortionate truth kiddies is that they did try to explain just what it was and i still cant figure it out.Shadow Puppets was a real big reminder of the movie Cube however i feel that this flick had a slightly bigger budget. and when I say slightly I do really mean that.The truth is the money more than likely went to the cast because they had some pretty hard hitters. the monster was clearly CGI but I'm not going to give it too hard of a time for that. Also the film only really used two locations so I have to give them props for working with what they had. The story was hard to get into at first but I eventully started to like it. I'm actually surprised that this wasn't a SCI-FI original movie before Starz picked it up.6 Dead Bodies2 side Breasts1 BeastshootingstabbingBashingDeath by sensory deprivationHot Chick swimming3 StarsDVD features a good Documentry with cast and crew interviews as well as some good TrailersCheck it out",3,Shadow Puppets,1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,1817,"['Anyway', 'Kiddies', 'What', 'Vulcan', 'Vampire', 'Candyman', 'hot', 'chick', 'have', 'common', 'Shadow', 'have', 'here', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'stuck', 'strange', 'place', 'memory', 'who', 'are', 'why', 'are', 'there.Members', 'group', 'include', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'as', 'well', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'Enterprise', 'not', 'mention', 'My', 'good', 'friend', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'lovely', 'Natasha', 'Alam', 'who', 'strip', 'down', 'nakedness', 'go', 'swim', 'fact', 'eminent', 'danger', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'her.Now', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'cast', 'rant', 'was', 'fact', 'group', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'gong', 'hey', 'are', 'being', 'chased', 'gialn', 'black', 'shadow', 'creature', 'can', 'stab', 'eat', 'alive', ""'m"", 'honestly', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'hell', 'thing', 'was', 'unfortionate', 'truth', 'kiddies', 'did', 'try', 'explain', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'i', 'still', 'cant', 'figure', 'out.Shadow', 'Puppets', 'was', 'real', 'big', 'reminder', 'movie', 'Cube', 'however', 'i', 'feel', 'flick', 'had', 'slightly', 'bigger', 'budget', 'when', 'say', 'slightly', 'do', 'really', 'mean', 'that.The', 'truth', 'money', 'more', 'likely', 'went', 'cast', 'had', 'pretty', 'hard', 'hitters', 'monster', 'was', 'clearly', 'CGI', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'too', 'hard', 'time', 'Also', 'film', 'only', 'really', 'used', 'two', 'locations', 'so', 'have', 'give', 'props', 'working', 'what', 'had', 'story', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'first', 'eventully', 'started', ""'m"", 'actually', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'SCI-FI', 'original', 'movie', 'Starz', 'picked', 'up.6', 'Dead', 'Bodies2', 'side', 'Breasts1', 'BeastshootingstabbingBashingDeath', 'sensory', 'deprivationHot', 'Chick', 'swimming3', 'StarsDVD', 'good', 'Documentry', 'cast', 'crew', 'interviews', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'TrailersCheck', 'out']",N/A
1072966,A278AF56R7J86,B000PWQP84,"C. Crockett ""Domino713""","[16, 20]","This intriguing horror movie resides in a strange inbetween genre that should appeal to most audiences. It is largely a psychological thriller, but it also has many horror movie aspects. One of my favorite things about this film was that it managed to scare me without resorting to mindless gore and buckets of blood (although, don't get me wrong...there's a little blood involved).Quick Synopsis: 8 strangers wake up in different rooms of a locked down facility with absolutely no memory of who they are, and no idea how they got there, or how to get out. Their surroundings look like some kind of a prison, or possibly a mental institution, but ominously there is no sign of their captors. Meanwhile, lurking in the darkness is a creature made of shadows, who begins to pick them off, one by one, attacking without warning, and leaving no trace of a body. Soon these strangers must find each other and band together in order to escape...that is, until they discover a medical room containing what appears to be the machine used to brain-wipe them all, leaving them with no memories -- next to the machine is the body of a brain-dead, but technically living man. According to the readouts, the device was used only 8 times...but there are 9 people. Someone is lying. Who can be trusted? And can they work together to find a way out before the shadows around them come to life...I found this movie incredibly entertaining and suspenseful. The horror aspect is of course the shadow monster who kills off any who stray too far away from the light. The psychological thriller aspect would be the fact that each person has had their memories wiped clean...but one of them is lying. Who is the betrayer? I'm not telling!Fans of James Marsters, who most know from his role as Spike on the cult favorite television show [[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)], are in for a treat. In this movie he's just as sexy as ever, so female fans will have an extra special treat (although there's really something for everyone considering the cast run around in nothing but their underwear for half of the movie).My one disappointment, which cost this movie a 5 star rating, would be it's ending. I'm talking about the very very end. They copped out a little bit (again, I won't tell you how), but it ended up being slightly anti-climactic. You'll know what I mean when you see it.However, all in all, I loved it, and hopefully they'll start making more movies like this one. It had a solid cast, a great premise, and some pretty decent special effects (especially for a movie that went straight to DVD). Give it a try, and you won't be disappointed. Whether you like the ending or not, most viewers will be able to appreciate the film as a whole.",4,"Edge of your seat psychological thriller, with a little horror mixed in...",1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,2764,"['intriguing', 'horror', 'movie', 'resides', 'strange', 'inbetween', 'genre', 'should', 'appeal', 'most', 'audiences', 'largely', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'also', 'many', 'horror', 'movie', 'aspects', 'One', 'favorite', 'things', 'film', 'was', 'managed', 'scare', 'resorting', 'mindless', 'gore', 'buckets', 'blood', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'little', 'blood', 'involved', '.Quick', 'Synopsis', '8', 'strangers', 'wake', 'up', 'different', 'rooms', 'locked', 'down', 'facility', 'absolutely', 'memory', 'who', 'are', 'idea', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'how', 'get', 'out', 'surroundings', 'look', 'kind', 'prison', 'possibly', 'mental', 'institution', 'ominously', 'sign', 'captors', 'Meanwhile', 'lurking', 'darkness', 'creature', 'made', 'shadows', 'who', 'pick', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'attacking', 'warning', 'leaving', 'trace', 'body', 'Soon', 'strangers', 'must', 'find', 'other', 'band', 'together', 'order', 'escape', 'discover', 'medical', 'room', 'containing', 'what', 'be', 'machine', 'used', 'brain-wipe', 'leaving', 'memories', 'next', 'machine', 'body', 'brain-dead', 'technically', 'living', 'man', 'According', 'readouts', 'device', 'was', 'used', 'only', '8', 'times', 'are', '9', 'people', 'Someone', 'lying', 'Who', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'can', 'work', 'together', 'find', 'way', 'shadows', 'come', 'life', 'found', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'suspenseful', 'horror', 'aspect', 'course', 'shadow', 'monster', 'who', 'who', 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'light', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'aspect', 'would', 'be', 'fact', 'person', 'had', 'memories', 'wiped', 'clean', 'one', 'lying', 'Who', 'betrayer', ""'m"", 'not', 'telling', 'Fans', 'James', 'Marsters', 'who', 'most', 'know', 'role', 'Spike', 'cult', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', '[', '[', 'ASIN', 'B000AQ68RI', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Collector', 'Set', '40', 'discs', ']', 'are', 'treat', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'sexy', 'ever', 'female', 'fans', 'will', 'have', 'extra', 'special', 'treat', 'really', 'something', 'everyone', 'considering', 'cast', 'run', 'around', 'nothing', 'underwear', 'half', 'movie', 'one', 'disappointment', 'cost', 'movie', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'would', 'be', 'ending', ""'m"", 'talking', 'very', 'very', 'end', 'copped', 'out', 'little', 'bit', 'again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'slightly', 'anti-climactic', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'see', 'it.However', 'loved', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'start', 'making', 'more', 'movies', 'one', 'had', 'solid', 'cast', 'great', 'premise', 'pretty', 'decent', 'special', 'effects', 'especially', 'movie', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'Give', 'try', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'not', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'film', 'whole']",N/A

1072970,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000PWQP84,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[4, 7]","I try to be thorough when writing movie reviews. I research cast members' names, acting histories, if the director has done anything else of note. I want to give the movie as much credit as I can.  I have done none of that with this movie. To give this movie any more credit than an hour and a half of watching will provide would be something of a personal insult.I can say that it has an actor fromBuffy The Vampire Slayer, but I don't know which one. I only know this much from reading comments that focus on the fact that a few moderately attractive stars spend the bulk of the film in their underwear. Seriously, folks. If all you want is titilation, I'm not sure why you don't just purchase an adult film.  If you did, odds are good it would have a better written and more unpredictable plot than this turkey.Eight strangers wake up locked in some kind of psychiatric ward with their memories completely and totally erased. Stalking them down is some kind of vicious shadow creature. They must figure out who they are, what they're doing there, and how to escape...before it's too late!The dialogue has two tones: Exposition and Plot Padding.  The cheesy, corn-fed dialogue is actually made WORSE by acting that lacks all sense of subtlety and timing.  To give you a better idea of my own experience with this film, I have transcribed below a conversation I had with my girlfriend as we watched the movie. Please keep in mind, this is not a joke. This is actually what we said and what happened on screen:[An exotic looking woman wearing nothing but underwear wakes up in a padded cell and looks around, emoting as hard as she can.]Me: She looks pretty good in that underwear. I wonder if that was why she was cast.Girlfriend: It must be cold in that cell. You can see heroffensive word.Me: Donaughty wordnormally point in two completely different directions like that?GF: They do if you've gotten aBoob Job.[Exotic Female leaves the cell and meets up with Rugged Good-Looks Man. They exchange banal dialogue about having no memories.]GF: So far this is not very good, is it?Me: Yeah. And he doesn't look nearly as good in his underwear as that chick.[On-screen, Rugged Good-Looks Man says to Exotic Female, ""At least you look better in your underwear than me.""]GF: Seriously? (laughs and drops soda)[A few scenes later, we are introduced to the Bird-Faced Computer Geek and the Sassy Black Chick. They talk about how much it sucks to not have any memories. They wander into a room with a swimming pool, where a Nymphomaniac Super Model is swimming naked. She also has no memories, but doesn't care about anything, like most Nymphomaniac Super Models.]GF: How many more characters are left?Me: Three.GF: So, I guess a black guy should be showing up right about now.[Five minutes later, the characters are attacked by an hysterical black guy.]Me & GF: No way!Me: Wait, wait, wait. I'm next. Okay. Let's see. Wholesome blonde. All of our female characters are strong and aggressive. We need a helpless blonde.[The characters run across a helpless blonde.]GF: (starts to laugh) Eh. This movie isn't very good at all, is it?Me: This sucks.It may sound fun to be able to predict a movie, and it is for a bit, but after that what you're left with is angry numbness, a sort of exhausting frustration. My girlfriend wanted us to stop the movie, but I have always made it a rule to watch every movie to the end. Seeing as how this movie was so predictable, I suppose I could've just guessed the ending, but I could never have guessed the final line, a fragment of dialogue so hackneyed that it illuminated the spirit that inspired this ridiculous film. The final line was, ultimately, what made me drop my rating from two stars (Didn't Like It) to one star (Hated It).Mindless, unimaginative ""scares"" dressed up to look like philosophically relevant ""horror,"" SHADOW PUPPETS is every cliche you hate, slathered with the kind of smug self-righteousness that gets most people punched in the face.

After a power outage, the chick realizes her padded rooms door is now unlocked and roams the place free finding other people in this place who also can not remember who they are or why they are there.Eventually the group left that find each other decide to try to escape but it's not as easy as they think as they start to discover that there is something in the shadows stalking them.Overall I thought this was a pretty cool movie, worthy of the rental and copy I burned of it.If you liked such movies like the remake of ""House On Haunted Hill"", ""Boo"" or ""Madhouse"" then this one should be enjoyable to you.I won't give away what the shadow is, but I will tell you it is not a ghost, nor a demon, so that may spark some interest for you to find out what it is.",3,Beware what lurks in the shadows!!,1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,915,"['movie', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'wake', 'up', 'sort', 'mental', 'facility', 'where', 'have', 'recollection', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'power', 'outage', 'chick', 'padded', 'rooms', 'door', 'now', 'unlocked', 'place', 'free', 'finding', 'other', 'people', 'place', 'who', 'also', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'who', 'are', 'why', 'are', 'there.Eventually', 'group', 'left', 'find', 'other', 'decide', 'try', 'escape', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'think', 'start', 'discover', 'something', 'shadows', 'stalking', 'them.Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'movie', 'worthy', 'rental', 'copy', 'burned', 'it.If', 'liked', 'such', 'movies', 'remake', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'Boo', 'Madhouse', 'then', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'you.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'what', 'shadow', 'will', 'tell', 'not', 'ghost', 'demon', 'may', 'spark', 'interest', 'find', 'out', 'what']",N/A

Are cast find themselves waking up in a asylum where they have no memory  of who they are and why they are there. Only to be pick off by a creature who has no shape or form. It is nothing more than a shadow that stalks them. Having no memory they have to find a way out and why they are there before it is to late. They soon discover there are eight of them trap in this place but one of them is not who they say they are. This begins mystery to discover who they are and what it is that is hunting them. The movie is pretty good it has very good acting a good plot and some suspense. It also has some mild violence with some good turns it. Don't expect a movie that will knock you off your feet but one that is above average that does keep your attention from begging to end. I say check it out I bought the DVD and have no real complaints its a good solid movie so check this one out.",3,Shadows Do Kill!,1191196800,"10 1, 2007",2007,978,"['movie', 'out', 'pretty', 'well', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'pretty', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'Are', 'cast', 'find', 'waking', 'up', 'asylum', 'where', 'have', 'memory', 'who', 'are', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'Only', 'be', 'pick', 'off', 'creature', 'who', 'shape', 'form', 'nothing', 'more', 'shadow', 'Having', 'memory', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'late', 'soon', 'are', 'eight', 'trap', 'place', 'one', 'not', 'who', 'say', 'are', 'mystery', 'discover', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'hunting', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'plot', 'suspense', 'also', 'mild', 'violence', 'good', 'turns', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'will', 'knock', 'off', 'feet', 'one', 'above', 'average', 'keep', 'attention', 'begging', 'end', 'say', 'check', 'out', 'bought', 'DVD', 'have', 'real', 'good', 'solid', 'movie', 'so', 'check', 'one', 'out']",N/A

Some of the ""fright"" moments might have played well in the theater but they're not particularly scary.  While the film is set up as a horror-mystery (with an intriguing premise) it doesn't deliver.  There are huge logic gaps in the story once it unfolds which makes the sometimes slow pace of the film have no payoff in the end.There are some good performances here but the material is weak.
