890724,A1R8LZYZR3377O,B0007UDC8K,ajsteele,"[2, 4]","I rented this movie based on some reviews and my predilection for eerie, unknown driver chase movies. Except for Randy Quaid, the movie contains unknown actors who do seem to have a small degree of talent, and I emphasize small. The plot of being chased in a blustery snow covered rural area is an interesting one. It's unfortunate that the three chased college kids are forced to speak ridiculous lines that are supposed to reflect the young, aloof, unsure ""studentesk"" language. The barroom brawl in the beginning which is right out of a cheap roadhouse movie detracted from all further possibles of believeability. Outside of comedy, why do film makers continue to show scenes of people being punched in the face multiple times. In reality, a person hit hard in the face once or twice will usually go down or quit. When you punch somebodys face once, let alone several times, theres splattered blood, torn knuckles and pain. To make matters worse, after the fight a phony, all-hear-me speach is given and they walk out only to be chased minutes later while getting into their car. I understand the film is low budget, but get the fundamental premise of realism correct. The action scenes are nothing special and the spookyness of the Black Cadilliac is hype that is further ruined by an uncreative ending. The grainy picture quality and less then average sound of the dvd is no doubt a trickling in of the reduced budget and rush-to-print. With some thought, a slow hand and sharp acting this could have worked. But then again, thats everything.",1,Unsurprisingly bad,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,1548,"['rented', 'movie', 'based', 'reviews', 'predilection', 'eerie', 'unknown', 'driver', 'chase', 'movies', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'movie', 'unknown', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'seem', 'have', 'small', 'degree', 'talent', 'emphasize', 'small', 'plot', 'being', 'chased', 'blustery', 'snow', 'covered', 'rural', 'area', 'interesting', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'three', 'chased', 'college', 'kids', 'are', 'forced', 'speak', 'ridiculous', 'lines', 'are', 'supposed', 'reflect', 'young', 'aloof', 'unsure', 'studentesk', 'language', 'barroom', 'brawl', 'beginning', 'right', 'cheap', 'roadhouse', 'movie', 'detracted', 'further', 'possibles', 'believeability', 'comedy', 'why', 'do', 'film', 'makers', 'continue', 'show', 'scenes', 'people', 'being', 'punched', 'face', 'multiple', 'times', 'reality', 'person', 'hit', 'hard', 'face', 'once', 'twice', 'will', 'usually', 'go', 'down', 'quit', 'When', 'punch', 'somebodys', 'face', 'once', 'let', 'alone', 'several', 'times', 'theres', 'splattered', 'blood', 'torn', 'knuckles', 'pain', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'fight', 'phony', 'all-hear-me', 'speach', 'given', 'walk', 'only', 'be', 'chased', 'minutes', 'later', 'getting', 'car', 'understand', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'get', 'fundamental', 'premise', 'realism', 'correct', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'nothing', 'special', 'spookyness', 'Black', 'Cadilliac', 'hype', 'further', 'ruined', 'uncreative', 'ending', 'grainy', 'picture', 'quality', 'less', 'then', 'average', 'sound', 'dvd', 'doubt', 'trickling', 'reduced', 'budget', 'rush-to-print', 'thought', 'slow', 'hand', 'sharp', 'acting', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'then', 'again', 'thats', 'everything']",N/A

890735,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B0007UDC8K,Ghoulie Guru,"[4, 9]","WARNING: possible spoilers aheadGoing by Black Cadillac, you'd think it was impossible to make a good scary road movie. But what about THE HITCHER? Or even more recent is the surprisingly effective DEAD END, which I've recommended highly on this site. It's definitely possible to make a good scary road thriller, but Black Cadillac is not one of them.Randy Quaid is the only thing that saves this movie from being much more than a rotting pile of road kill. The story centers on three underage guys who make their way across the state line to get drunk and hopefully get laid. One of the trio is a smartass with a weird scar on his face who continually pops Pez candy through the whole movie. I love those quirky characters. Nothing screams B-level thriller like an intentionally quirky character.Scarface Pez Eater gets into a fight at the bar, which causes our trio to go on the run before any of them can get lucky with the ladies. The local hicks chase them out into the parking lot and throw bottles at their car as our heroes make their escape.Pretty soon, a mysterious black Cadillac starts following them. There are some decent chase scenes through the snow, with this demonic black Cadillac chasing our boys. Reminded me a little of Christine or even The Car. But after about twenty minutes of this cat and mouse routine, it starts to get a little boring. So, enter Randy Quaid as a stranded Law Dog.Our boys pick up Randy, who instantly becomes the Mysterious Oracle in the Back Seat, spouting crude jokes and words of wisdom with equal enthusiasm. His presence in the car causes all the requisite dirty little secrets to come to the surface. We come to find out that all three of our boys have skeletons in their closet, things that they don't like to talk about. The big reveal is that one the boys slept with Randy Quaid's wife and ruined his marriage.If you've seen Angel Heart, you'll probably be able to figure out that Sheriff Randy planned this whole evening as a really long, boring, drawn out way of getting his revenge against the pipsqueak who stole his woman.

Collins ""ScorpioGeek""","[0, 0]","As a ""car guy"", I have to admit I was drawn to watch the movie, more than anything else, by the vintage Cadillac in the movie artwork. So fair warning for folks like myself that it's not really a ""car movie"" in the sense of ""Christine"", ""Two Lane Blacktop"", or ""Corvette Summer"". But an old Cadillac (two actually if you watch closely) is used to bust ass in the film, and the car itself could be considered a main character. So now you know. So with that out of the way, the movie is a reasonably solid B movie effort that's worth watching, and Randy Quaid does a good job (spoiler alert: as the bad guy), and so do the other actors. I actually enjoyed it, especially once it really gets underway about 15 minutes in. The film has its quirks - mostly LOTS of continuity flubs - mentioned in other reviews, so I believe the drinkability of two or three beers would likely enhance the movie's viewability.

The only problem I have with the movie is the bad language that flies through out the movie. During the scene where the boys start fighting with each other outside the car, the bad language really flies, the movie would have been better without the bad language. I guess movie writers and producers just assume that everyone talks like that. I know I don't, I also don't like hearing it either. I would have give it a 4 out 5, but the language hurts it. 2 1/5 out of 5.",3,"A Good Scare, but bad language though!",1117411200,"05 30, 2005",2005,586,"['movie', 'good', 'job', 'creepiness', 'scares', 'movie', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'bad', 'language', 'movie', 'scene', 'where', 'boys', 'start', 'fighting', 'other', 'car', 'bad', 'language', 'really', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'bad', 'language', 'guess', 'movie', 'writers', 'producers', 'just', 'assume', 'everyone', 'talks', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'hearing', 'would', 'have', 'give', '4', '5', 'language', '2', '1/5', '5']",N/A

Matheson's story was a far deeper study into the human psyche, as is his wont. Black Cadillac did not quite hit that mark, but holds its own, nonetheless, and actually has a quite different story line from Duel, so maintains a decent level of originality. A fun movie with hints of ""Christine"" (a car none of us will ever really get over, right?), and a wee bit of ""Deliverance"", as they are drawn deeper into deep dark forests, backwoods and wilderness. So, lots of subliminal links to other movies, yet Black Cadillac manages to stand apart, with a fairly surprising, interesting end. Worth watching, especially for the cars involved. The black cadillac itself comes across as powerful, scary and almost supernatural. Nicely produced little nailbiter. The acting was really good and made the story thoroughly enjoyable.",4,Surprisingly good... a bit of a gem!,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,946,"['movie', 'reminded', 'quite', 'bit', 'Duel', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'short', 'story', 'same', 'name', 'Matheson', 'story', 'was', 'far', 'deeper', 'study', 'human', 'psyche', 'wont', 'Black', 'Cadillac', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'hit', 'mark', 'own', 'nonetheless', 'actually', 'quite', 'different', 'story', 'line', 'Duel', 'so', 'decent', 'level', 'originality', 'fun', 'movie', 'hints', 'Christine', 'car', 'none', 'will', 'ever', 'really', 'get', 'right', 'wee', 'bit', 'Deliverance', 'are', 'drawn', 'deeper', 'deep', 'dark', 'forests', 'backwoods', 'wilderness', 'So', 'lots', 'subliminal', 'links', 'other', 'movies', 'yet', 'Black', 'Cadillac', 'stand', 'apart', 'fairly', 'surprising', 'interesting', 'end', 'Worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'cars', 'involved', 'black', 'cadillac', 'powerful', 'scary', 'almost', 'supernatural', 'Nicely', 'produced', 'little', 'nailbiter', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'made', 'story', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable']",N/A
