They had a kid who looked older, say 12, acting in ways that would have been forgivable for maybe a 6 year old.  I don't know if the kid they cast is that way or if the director has no children, has no neices or nephews and possibly has never met a child in their lives, because after 15 minutes of his whining we were going to turn it off, and only kept watching because it was so bad it became fun to make fun of.Also, one thing that always makes me suspicious of some reviews, are when the people who have given a movie 5 stars have never reviewed another movie on Amazon.

1199170,A1YXOLDXUXTLQ3,B001H2ZHJ4,Debbie Potter,"[0, 0]",Another movie that shows how people can allow their working lives to disrupt and hurt their families. An excellent movie.,5,Christmas Town,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,121,"['movie', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'allow', 'working', 'lives', 'disrupt', 'hurt', 'families', 'excellent', 'movie']",Christmas Town
1199171,A37M1Y79UWPQ2P,B001H2ZHJ4,E. Schmidt,"[25, 32]","This review will be a critique of the movie, for those unfamiliar with Christmas Town.  Those of you who love the movie, will probably love the DVD, although it's presented as a barebones release with no real special features.  The uninitiated, who are searching for a new Christmas classic, can continue searching elsewhere.  I have to agree with the other reviewers.  This movie is pretty bad.  Not in a so-bad-it's-good sense...just plain bad.  It's not the worst film ever made, but the story, casting, acting, and even the filming locations are all lackluster.The story revolves around a ten year old boy named Mason and his workaholic mother who take a trip to visit the boy's Grandfather in a Christmas themed town.  The town houses NP (North Pole) Enterprises, which turns out to be a distribution center for the real Santa Claus (bet you didn't see that one coming).  The town is also home to the local restaurant owner, who is, of course, the love interest for our single Mother (bet you didn't see that one coming either).The movie plays out as your typical Lifetime Movie Network feature, with all the usual predictable drama and romance.  However, about 3/4 of the way through, the movie takes a bizarre turn, as Mason infiltrates Santa's NP Enterprises compound.  The tone of the movie completely changes, and becomes comedic (although the term ""stupid"" would be a better descriptor).  After about 15 minutes, the tone of the movie shifts back to drama.  The comedic part seems almost surreal, and doesn't mesh well with the overall flow of the rest of the feature.The real problem with this story is that the characters don't really grow over the course of the film.  The Mother starts off as a self-centered workaholic, and ends up pretty much the same.  The romance between her and the strapping young restaurateur barely even gets off the ground.  Her son is an obnoxious character as well.  Throughout the movie, he repeatedly does the same four things: complain, disobey his mother, run away, and spy on people (usually in that order).  At the end of the movie, he's still up to his usual shenanigans.  Since this is a character driven film (vs. a plot driven one), it makes me wonder what the purpose of the script was, if the characters didn't grow.Aside from the poor story, this film also has terrible casting and acting.  Santa's evles are played by fully-grown, middle aged, men, who act like grumpy dock workers.  Patrick Muldoon's acting can be likened to an announcer on a coffee commercial, except, instead of touting the virtues of hand picked beans and rich aroma, he drones on and on about the magic of Christmas and the power of believing.  Every time he opens his mouth, something that's supposed to be profound comes out.The sets and filming locales for Christmas Town are on the same level as the acting.  First off, there isn't a trace of show to be seen anywhere, and it looks as if everything was filmed in mid-summer.  Santa's warehouse isn't very magical either.  There's an unintentionally hilarious scene in which Mason is looking around in doe-eyed wonder at the joys of Santa's storeroom.  The only problem is that it looks like this scene was filmed in Costco...and not even in the toy aisle.  There is also a long sequence in which Mason sneaks through a maze of corridors at NP Enterprises' headquarters.  The problem here is that it's very obvious that he's running through the same two hallways repeatedly, as you can see him passing the same signs and doors time and time again (almost like a scene from Tom and Jerry).Sure, there are much worse ways that you could spend two hours.  If you see Christmas Town show up in the local TV listings, go ahead and check it out.  However, this DVD definitely isn't worth the $15+ that it retails for.  If a money exchange needs to occur in order for you to watch this movie, you're probably going to be disappointed.",2,Another Sub-Par Made-For-TV Christmas Disaster,1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,3910,"['review', 'will', 'be', 'critique', 'movie', 'unfamiliar', 'Christmas', 'Town', 'who', 'love', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'DVD', 'presented', 'barebones', 'release', 'real', 'special', 'features', 'uninitiated', 'who', 'are', 'searching', 'new', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'can', 'continue', 'searching', 'elsewhere', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Not', ""so-bad-it's-good"", 'sense', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'not', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'story', 'casting', 'acting', 'even', 'filming', 'locations', 'are', 'lackluster.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'named', 'Mason', 'workaholic', 'mother', 'who', 'take', 'trip', 'visit', 'boy', 'Grandfather', 'Christmas', 'themed', 'town', 'town', 'houses', 'NP', 'North', 'Pole', 'Enterprises', 'out', 'be', 'distribution', 'center', 'real', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'coming', 'town', 'also', 'home', 'local', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'who', 'course', 'love', 'interest', 'single', 'Mother', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'coming', '.The', 'movie', 'out', 'typical', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', 'feature', 'usual', 'predictable', 'drama', 'romance', 'However', '3/4', 'way', 'movie', 'bizarre', 'turn', 'Mason', 'Santa', 'NP', 'Enterprises', 'compound', 'tone', 'movie', 'completely', 'changes', 'comedic', 'term', 'stupid', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'descriptor', '15', 'minutes', 'tone', 'movie', 'back', 'drama', 'comedic', 'part', 'almost', 'surreal', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'well', 'overall', 'flow', 'rest', 'feature.The', 'real', 'problem', 'story', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'grow', 'course', 'film', 'Mother', 'off', 'self-centered', 'workaholic', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'romance', 'strapping', 'young', 'restaurateur', 'barely', 'even', 'ground', 'son', 'obnoxious', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'repeatedly', 'same', 'four', 'things', 'complain', 'disobey', 'mother', 'run', 'away', 'spy', 'people', 'usually', 'order', 'end', 'movie', 'still', 'up', 'usual', 'shenanigans', 'character', 'driven', 'film', 'plot', 'driven', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'purpose', 'script', 'was', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow.Aside', 'poor', 'story', 'film', 'also', 'terrible', 'casting', 'acting', 'Santa', 'evles', 'are', 'played', 'fully-grown', 'middle', 'aged', 'men', 'who', 'act', 'grumpy', 'dock', 'workers', 'Patrick', 'Muldoon', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'likened', 'announcer', 'coffee', 'commercial', 'instead', 'touting', 'virtues', 'hand', 'picked', 'beans', 'rich', 'aroma', 'magic', 'Christmas', 'power', 'believing', 'time', 'mouth', 'something', 'supposed', 'be', 'profound', 'out.The', 'sets', 'filming', 'locales', 'Christmas', 'Town', 'are', 'same', 'level', 'acting', 'First', 'off', ""n't"", 'trace', 'show', 'be', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'everything', 'was', 'filmed', 'mid-summer', 'Santa', 'warehouse', ""n't"", 'very', 'magical', 'either', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'Mason', 'looking', 'around', 'doe-eyed', 'wonder', 'joys', 'Santa', 'storeroom', 'only', 'problem', 'scene', 'was', 'filmed', 'Costco', 'not', 'even', 'toy', 'aisle', 'also', 'long', 'sequence', 'Mason', 'maze', 'corridors', 'NP', 'Enterprises', 'headquarters', 'problem', 'here', 'very', 'obvious', 'running', 'same', 'two', 'hallways', 'repeatedly', 'can', 'see', 'passing', 'same', 'signs', 'doors', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'almost', 'scene', 'Tom', 'Jerry', '.Sure', 'are', 'much', 'worse', 'ways', 'could', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'see', 'Christmas', 'Town', 'show', 'up', 'local', 'TV', 'listings', 'go', 'ahead', 'check', 'out', 'However', 'DVD', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'worth', '15+', 'money', 'exchange', 'occur', 'order', 'watch', 'movie', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed']",Christmas Town

1199180,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B001H2ZHJ4,Thomas M. Sipos,"[0, 0]","Okay, this is not a great film. Actually, it's a made-for-TV (cable TV?) movie, shot in Canada, although the story is set in California.Yes, it's predictable. A Christmasy, fish-out-of-water story with stereotyped characters. A workaholic mom who hates Christmas (yet another spin on Scrooge) finds herself in a picture-perfect small town that LOVES Christmas. Everyone pokes gentle, but affectionate, barbs at her for not loving Christmas (for her own good, of course). In the end she relents (due to the flimsiest of plot twists) and loves Christmas too.And to top it all off with a predictably ""perfect"" ending, the real-life Santa makes an appearance. No, that is NOT a spoiler -- anyone can see from the moment that mom enters the town that Santa hangs out here. She even sees Santa early on, but doesn't believe it's him. Her 9-year-old son knows better, of course.The script is no great literary work. It's very paint-by-numbers, broadcasting every plot development well in advance, and offering zero surprises.The script is also very on-the-nose, spelling everything out; the characters broadcast their ""character types"" -- again and again and again - throughout the film. I lost count of how many times the mom said ""I'm practical."" and ""I'm a realist."" and that she doesn't like Christmas.Likewise, the other characters are always saying how much they love Christmas, and espouse Christmasy philosophy like ""You gotta believe."" and ""You gotta have faith."" and saying that mom should not be so cynical. To which she always repeats that she's practical and a realist.The script not only has zero surprises -- it has zero subtlety.Even so, I kinda liked this film. It's bland, but pleasant. Yes, you know where the story is going, but you can say the same about slasher films -- and I love slasher films.Now, if you want a funny, smart, quirky, authentically poignant romantic comedy/Christmas film, I recommendDinner at Fred's. In it, Parker Posey has real chemistry with her love interest, Gil Bellows.The same cannot be said for the ""romantic couple"" (mom and her Christmas-loving love interest) in CHRISTMAS TOWN. Zero chemistry.Yet despite all those zero's, I enjoyed CHRISTMAS TOWN. I found the characters likeable and attractive, and enjoyed the ride even if I could guess every plot point ahead of time.",3,"bland and predictable, but still pleasant and enjoyable",1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,2318,"['Okay', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'Actually', 'made-for-TV', 'cable', 'TV', 'movie', 'shot', 'Canada', 'story', 'set', 'California.Yes', 'predictable', 'Christmasy', 'fish-out-of-water', 'story', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'workaholic', 'mom', 'who', 'Christmas', 'yet', 'spin', 'Scrooge', 'picture-perfect', 'small', 'town', 'LOVES', 'Christmas', 'Everyone', 'gentle', 'affectionate', 'barbs', 'not', 'loving', 'Christmas', 'own', 'good', 'course', 'end', 'due', 'flimsiest', 'plot', 'twists', 'Christmas', 'too.And', 'top', 'off', 'predictably', 'perfect', 'ending', 'real-life', 'Santa', 'appearance', 'No', 'NOT', 'spoiler', 'anyone', 'can', 'see', 'moment', 'town', 'Santa', 'out', 'here', 'even', 'Santa', 'early', ""n't"", 'believe', '9-year-old', 'son', 'better', 'course.The', 'script', 'great', 'literary', 'work', 'very', 'paint-by-numbers', 'broadcasting', 'plot', 'development', 'well', 'advance', 'offering', 'zero', 'surprises.The', 'script', 'also', 'very', 'on-the-nose', 'spelling', 'everything', 'out', 'characters', 'broadcast', 'character', 'types', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'film', 'lost', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'mom', 'said', ""'m"", 'practical', ""'m"", 'realist', ""n't"", 'like', 'Christmas.Likewise', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'always', 'saying', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'Christmas', 'espouse', 'Christmasy', 'philosophy', 'got', 'ta', 'believe', 'got', 'ta', 'have', 'faith', 'saying', 'mom', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'cynical', 'always', 'repeats', 'practical', 'realist.The', 'script', 'not', 'only', 'zero', 'surprises', 'zero', 'subtlety.Even', 'so', 'kinda', 'liked', 'film', 'bland', 'pleasant', 'Yes', 'know', 'where', 'story', 'going', 'can', 'say', 'same', 'slasher', 'films', 'love', 'slasher', 'films.Now', 'want', 'funny', 'smart', 'quirky', 'authentically', 'poignant', 'romantic', 'comedy/Christmas', 'film', 'recommendDinner', 'Fred', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'real', 'chemistry', 'love', 'interest', 'Gil', 'Bellows.The', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'romantic', 'couple', 'mom', 'Christmas-loving', 'love', 'interest', 'CHRISTMAS', 'TOWN', 'Zero', 'zero', 'enjoyed', 'CHRISTMAS', 'TOWN', 'found', 'characters', 'likeable', 'attractive', 'enjoyed', 'ride', 'even', 'could', 'guess', 'plot', 'point', 'ahead', 'time']",Christmas Town
