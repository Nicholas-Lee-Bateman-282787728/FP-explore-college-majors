882142,AJVK8E6MEF6WU,B0007LI10S,Alex,"[3, 5]","Tour de force film from two truly superb actors.  At first I was wary because the plot sounded dull and monotonous but I was at the edge of my seat the whole time even though most of the movie is just Steve watching a video, as other reviewers have noted.  Both Gary Sweet and Helen Bunday do fantastic jobs of conveying their characters' emotions from start to finish.  Had these two not been so superb, the movie would have miserably failed, but they push it to some wild psychological limits, leading me to give this 5 stars.  It's a difficult job to carry a movie on your shoulders like this, especially for Bunday who has to act on camera...for a camera (if that makes any sense..).  Steve and Alexandra are having one-sided conversations and the actors had to emote and express without a live person to do it with - this just made it even more powerful and striking.  It was an intimate and voyeuristic view of a seemingly-fine suburban marriage, and it was a wild exciting and thought-provoking ride.",5,Powerful Stuff,1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,1007,"['Tour', 'de', 'force', 'film', 'two', 'truly', 'superb', 'actors', 'first', 'was', 'wary', 'plot', 'sounded', 'dull', 'monotonous', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'whole', 'time', 'even', 'most', 'movie', 'just', 'Steve', 'watching', 'video', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'Gary', 'Sweet', 'Helen', 'Bunday', 'do', 'fantastic', 'jobs', 'conveying', 'characters', 'emotions', 'start', 'finish', 'Had', 'two', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'superb', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'miserably', 'failed', 'push', 'wild', 'psychological', 'limits', 'leading', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'difficult', 'job', 'carry', 'movie', 'shoulders', 'especially', 'Bunday', 'who', 'act', 'camera', 'camera', 'sense..', 'Steve', 'Alexandra', 'are', 'having', 'one-sided', 'conversations', 'actors', 'had', 'emote', 'express', 'live', 'person', 'do', 'just', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'striking', 'was', 'intimate', 'voyeuristic', 'view', 'seemingly-fine', 'suburban', 'marriage', 'was', 'wild', 'exciting', 'thought-provoking', 'ride']",Alexandra's Project

882144,AYP0Z0FLR9Z0R,B0007LI10S,avoraciousreader,"[6, 13]","This film will definitely not appeal to everyone.  It is emotionally and sexually brutal, and the weak of heart or stomach should stick to Hillary Duff flicks, or perhaps a good clean slasher film.  When I saw a 'sneak preview' a few days ago, not one walked out during the film but there was a stunned and silent exodus after.  The closest I can come to its raw impact are Peter Greenaway films such as ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"", though ""Alexandra's Project"" is simpler and more personal.  It compels you to watch even as it makes it uncomfortable to do so.The film starts out easily, though with some forebodings of camera angle and incident.  Steve (Gary Sweet) wakes up in an Australian suburb on his birthday; his charming children give him some presents, and his wife Alexandra (Helen Buday) tells him that a surprise will be waiting him when he comes home. It seems an idyllic scene, but ....  When Alexandra wants to pay a bill, Steve forcefully reminds her the accounts are his ...  their row house has been fitted with deadbolt locks and automated security shutters (doubly jarring in free and open Australia) ... Steve curses a sinister neighbor out watering the communal lawn.  At work, Steve is called into the boardroom ... sweatingly unsure if he is to be fired or promoted (perhaps, we think, his controlling nature at home stems from lack of control at work?).  But it is good news, and he goes home ready to celebrate ...... only to find an empty, dark and shuttered house, the light bulbs removed and a video tape on the TV saying ""watch me"".  Pretty creepy, but when he puts it in it's a birthday present -- Alexandra informing him the children are staying with a relative and then doing an amateurish striptease for the camera as Steve has a beer (at the tape's suggestion) and enthusiastically watches.  Then she stops, not quite naked, and sits down to vent her anger and frustration at her life and him.  When he tries to escape, he finds he is cleverly locked in by all those security devices, and he is forced to continue, gradually becoming drunker, distress playing on his face.It would be too much of a spoiler to describe what happens next, but there are several surprises as the tension builds and a sad and enigmatic ending.  It becomes over the top at times, but in a way that is the point.  We don't know if Alexandra is being logical and rational, reacting to a desperate situation, or overreacting out of dementia or paranoia.Buday's is a bravura performance, as she chews up the scenery and convincingly plays a woman who is (justifiably or not) not about to take it any more.  Sweet's performance is less overtly dramatic, but excellent in the play of emotion on his face as he gradually dissolves in pity and horror. Both actors take great risks.  It is remarkable that each is alone, Buday/Alexandra speaking to camera while Sweet/Steve must act passively and receptively.Women in the audience will undoubtedly sympathize with Alexandra's grievances and frustrations, while men will likely see her taped monologue as a metaphor for women's desire to have the men in their lives as mute objects, receiving an angry harangue without rebuttal.

At work his colleagues had a cake with candles and his boss gave him a promotion. And his wife Alexandra promised him a surprise in the evening. Some surprise. The film opens with a camera panning through the winding road of a sterile suburb, and soft, discordant music. The very first sentence of the film belongs to Alexandra as she is alone in the bathroom looking at herself in the mirror: ""I'm so sorry, Steve. . . NO! I'm not sorry! No one should ever be sorry to stand up for their own self!""The rest of the film then takes place in the living room as Steve watches the ""surprise"" birthday tape that Alexandra made before she left him. Her powerfully manipulative monologue to Steve takes him on a roller coaster of emotions straight to hell: humor, disbelief, regret, sadness, pity, anger, rage, and finally despair. ""You didn't marry me, Steve,"" she tells him, ""you married my body."" And so she makes it clear just how a marriage devoid of affection, intimacy, and mutual respect had made her feel. This film is hard to watch because it is without nuance.

I arrived 45 minutes early thinking that I would beat the crowd at the door.  Come to find out I was the only one in the theatre for a half hour.  Pretty funny.  This movie was really the first foreign film I had ever really seen in theatres.  The story was excellent and original of any other film I can think of.  My only beef with the film is that it went on a bit long, however, using that time makes you feel the distraught that this father is feeling.A man comes home from work to an empty house with birthday decorations up everywhere.  There is a tv set up with a videotape ready to be played.  He gets a beer, puts in the tape and it is his wife and two children wishing him a happy birthday.  The two kids exit the room at the request of their mother, and the mother, Alexandra, starts a striptease for her husband.  As the tape goes on, his wife gets more and more cynical, and the dread gets thicker.  You cannot help but feel sorrow for this poor man.  As the movie draws to a close, it may be impossible to comprehend the type of sabotage commited by this woman.  Shock and awe!  Terrible what this man must now endure.Anyone who has read my past unedited review of this movie might remember some spoilers.  Well, I only edited the past review to appease the bookworm above me.

Tense, disturbing, well-acted. This is a story of one woman unhappy in her marriage, who cooks up a rather original (and extreme) act of revenge against her husband. Most of the film is him watching the VCR tape she's made for him. What throws me off a bit is that I can't quite understand the message behind the film. It comes very close to being nothing more than hateful feminist drivel (and if it was directed by a woman, it would have probably led me to assume just that). If doesn't even attempt to state that the husband was in fact completely deserving of what the wife did to him. Apparently, the only thing this poor man is guilty of is high libido. He doesn't abuse his wife. He's a good father to his kids. He's a good provider. She implies he's cheating, but there's nothing in the film to substantiate this claim. His only sin is that he's constantly horny for his wife - well, I'll be damned! Any woman who can say her husband lusts after her a decade or more after he married her should feel very fortunate. I'm female, and I found myself rooting for the husband every step of the way. I HATED the female lead. Whether or not this was the director's intention, I'm not sure. I felt it was a drawback for me.

It takes chances (both male and female full frontal nudity among them), relates a tale that will likely make the viewer cringe and have some bad dreams, depends solely  (well, practically solely) on two actors to pull this off, and in the end brings to the table a story of a terminally dysfunctional marriage.Steve (Gary Sweet) and Alexandra (Helen Buday) live a middle class existence with their two children in Australia. After a strangely cold beginning - today is Steve's birthday and his two children and Alexandra have plans for an evening's celebration.  Steve seems to start the day in an amorous mood but Alexandra is surprisingly unresponsive: Steve's attention is disturbed by the fat, ugly security systems installer neighbor (Bogdan Koca) who is constantly watering his garden. Steve is off, and at work his colleagues present him with a surprise birthday party AND an advancement in his company. When Steve returns home, his house is deserted and darkened with almost all the lightbulbs missing, all easy access outside cut off and a videotape waiting for him, a videotape labeled `play me'. Plugging the tape in Steve is instructed to get a beer and sit and watch what is about to unfold. On the tape Alexandra lays out her complaints about their marriage - Alexandra's feeling of abandonment, lack of sexual fulfillment, lack of intimacy, no control over the direction of her life. One of her biggest complaints is that Steve `married her body' and made love at her, not with her. In an attempt to regain control of her body and her life Alexandra does some sexually perverse things on the tape to humiliate both Steve and the `body' he married. She explains her grievances with him, her reasons for disappearing with the children and her revenge for how he treated her in a way he would never forget.

Maybe some combination of both but think she had to have the inclination from the start. Reason is people go through relationships similar and accept it without making videos. The critical factor was the husband knew nothing of how she felt and as it turns out, not much about her life at all. Ironically he was a control freak with all the home security as an outward indicator and personally it in that he wouldn't even let her pay the bills.

True, the story starts out relatively tame; but that eerie sounding music almost from the very beginning really had an impact on me! The acting is superlative; and I really liked the choreography and the cinematography. The plot moves along at a good pace; I was never once bored thanks to the superlative acting particularly by Gary Sweet and Helen Buday. I should add that there is full frontal nudity and a fair amount of swearing in this picture, so this is not exactly a ""family film.""When the film starts, we meet an Australian family living a suburban life. Steve's (Gary Sweet) birthday starts out well enough with his children giving him presents and high fives; Steve's wife Alexandra (Helen Buday) seems happy enough although we get this foreboding scene in which she says to the mirror that she's not sorry to Steve.Oh, yes; something major is up! Steve and Alexandra's house has tons of door locks and security features for its windows. Indeed, the house is a type of prison because the locks are both on the inside and the outside; anyone going out needs a key to leave the house! Alexandra seems frustrated when she asks Steve if she can handle the bills; Steve brushes off her request without even looking up from his morning newspaper.At work, Steve gets a handsome birthday present from his boss--a much coveted promotion! He also looks forward to the ""surprise"" his family is planning for him when he gets home from work.But when Steve gets home from work, very strange things have occurred. The house is deserted; furniture and children's clothing are strewn about all over the place. Steve at first thinks it's a joke; but it's not--there's only electricity for the VCR, the television, the refrigerator and precious little else. His cell phone battery has even been replaced by a bullet! Steve sees a VCR tape labeled ""Play Me;"" and he sits down in his armchair in front of the TV to watch it.At first the tape seems wonderful--Alexandra and the kids wish him a happy birthday and then Alexandra does a strip tease that has Steve lusting for his wife. But then Alexandra launches into an angry tirade, some of which Steve skips over because he says he's ""heard it before""--until he sees Alexandra pointing a gun at the screen when he finally stops the tape to watch more of it!Filmmaker Rolf de Heer said that he wanted to create ""a balance"" between the two characters of Steve and Alexandra; but I have a tough time seeing it. Alexandra's complete message to Steve and her actions on the tape are the hallmark of a rather troubled person; her cruelty is unjustified. True, Steve has been insensitive to Alexandra's needs; but I doubt he deserved everything that was ""coming to him.""The DVD comes with a few extras. I liked the short film bonus feature and the information about Rolf de Heer, Helen Buday and Gary Sweet was very interesting.Alexandra's Project will appeal to people who like thrillers; fans of the actors and Rolf de Heer would do well to get this for their collections.",4,"haunting, intense but not for just anyone",1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,3112,"['Alexandra', 'Project', 'captivating', 'thriller', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'way', 'True', 'story', 'out', 'relatively', 'tame', 'eerie', 'sounding', 'music', 'almost', 'very', 'beginning', 'really', 'had', 'impact', 'acting', 'superlative', 'really', 'liked', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'was', 'never', 'once', 'bored', 'thanks', 'superlative', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Gary', 'Sweet', 'Helen', 'Buday', 'should', 'add', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'fair', 'amount', 'swearing', 'picture', 'not', 'exactly', 'family', 'film', 'When', 'film', 'meet', 'Australian', 'family', 'living', 'suburban', 'life', 'Steve', 'Gary', 'Sweet', 'birthday', 'out', 'well', 'enough', 'children', 'giving', 'presents', 'high', 'fives', 'Steve', 'wife', 'Alexandra', 'Helen', 'Buday', 'happy', 'enough', 'get', 'foreboding', 'scene', 'mirror', 'not', 'sorry', 'Steve.Oh', 'yes', 'something', 'major', 'up', 'Steve', 'Alexandra', 'house', 'tons', 'door', 'locks', 'security', 'features', 'windows', 'Indeed', 'house', 'type', 'prison', 'locks', 'are', 'inside', 'outside', 'anyone', 'going', 'out', 'key', 'leave', 'house', 'Alexandra', 'frustrated', 'when', 'Steve', 'can', 'handle', 'bills', 'Steve', 'request', 'even', 'looking', 'up', 'morning', 'newspaper.At', 'work', 'Steve', 'handsome', 'birthday', 'present', 'boss', 'much', 'coveted', 'promotion', 'also', 'forward', 'surprise', 'family', 'planning', 'when', 'home', 'work.But', 'when', 'Steve', 'home', 'work', 'very', 'strange', 'things', 'have', 'occurred', 'house', 'deserted', 'furniture', 'children', 'clothing', 'are', 'strewn', 'place', 'Steve', 'first', 'joke', 'not', 'only', 'electricity', 'VCR', 'television', 'refrigerator', 'precious', 'little', 'else', 'cell', 'phone', 'battery', 'even', 'been', 'replaced', 'bullet', 'Steve', 'VCR', 'tape', 'labeled', 'Play', 'Me', 'down', 'armchair', 'front', 'TV', 'watch', 'it.At', 'first', 'tape', 'wonderful', 'Alexandra', 'kids', 'wish', 'happy', 'birthday', 'then', 'Alexandra', 'strip', 'tease', 'Steve', 'lusting', 'wife', 'then', 'Alexandra', 'angry', 'tirade', 'Steve', 'heard', 'Alexandra', 'pointing', 'gun', 'screen', 'when', 'finally', 'tape', 'watch', 'more', 'Filmmaker', 'Rolf', 'de', 'Heer', 'said', 'wanted', 'create', 'balance', 'two', 'characters', 'Steve', 'Alexandra', 'have', 'tough', 'time', 'seeing', 'Alexandra', 'complete', 'message', 'Steve', 'actions', 'tape', 'are', 'hallmark', 'rather', 'troubled', 'person', 'cruelty', 'unjustified', 'True', 'Steve', 'been', 'insensitive', 'Alexandra', 'needs', 'doubt', 'deserved', 'everything', 'was', 'coming', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'liked', 'short', 'film', 'bonus', 'feature', 'information', 'Rolf', 'de', 'Heer', 'Helen', 'Buday', 'Gary', 'Sweet', 'was', 'very', 'interesting.Alexandra', 'Project', 'will', 'appeal', 'people', 'who', 'thrillers', 'fans', 'actors', 'Rolf', 'de', 'Heer', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'get', 'collections']",Alexandra's Project

The director / writer was in attendance for a Q&A; after the film.De Heer claimed that he strived for balance in the two characters when making the film. He also admitted that most people who see the film do not see much balance. He also said that feminist groups were the main advocates for the film.After watching I came to two conclusions on his intentions.1. The only balance that I saw is that in the beginning she is miserable and at the end he is miserable.2. I cant see how any feminst group would get behind this movie. DeHeer portrays this woman as a crazy b#$%#. She is vengeful, she is a whore (literaly), she abuses drugs, and probably worst of all she kidnaps their children.I would hate to meet the kind of people that support this lunatic. Any feminst that supports a person like this needs mental help. This women is evil and in real life she would lose both of those kids to the father. Dont mistake me here, the father is no choir boy himself. He certainly has his vices and the writer makes sure you know that. But by the end their is only one victim.As a movie it is very well written and clever. It is a plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat for what will happen next.

This is not even the kind of film you ""recommend"": as in ""you have to see this film"" -- it is a difficult film to watch (and I assume this would be true whether you are male or female).  It is, nonetheless a powerful film, that can be easily misunderstood (as if it were merely a kind of ""female revenge"" picture: kill bill where Alexandra destroys the psyche rather than the body; even to compare this film to the Japanese film ""Audition"" would be a serious misunderstanding).  One of the latest films by Australian auteur Rolf de Heer, Alexandra's project is a nuanced and subtle attack on the ways in which men (backed up by cultural myths of what it means to be a ""successful man"") objectify the women in their lives.  To any one who has seen the film, this might seem like sarcasm: there is nothing subtle about Alexandra's ""project,"" and she is extraordinarily blunt.  What is subtle about the film is the way in which Rolf de Heer shows how easily Steve (the ""protagonist"" and ""victim"" of the film) completely misses the point of her message, how fully he misunderstands her (and how easy it is to share in that misunderstanding as an audience member).  The despair and devastation he feels does not amount to a realization that for so long he has deliberately misunderstood and denied her needs (believing that to ""provide for her"" is enough) -- rather, he begins to feel that what she is showing is her own ""masculine lust"" and it turns him on even as it devastates him (what destroys him, ""unmans"" him, effectively, is his belief that what this was about was her feeling lust analogous to the lust he had never seen to be problematic in himself).  He can't see that what she is doing in a confused effort to get him to listen to her is at least as painful to her as it is to himself, that while he gets simultaneously aroused and disgusted she feels only disgust for herself and at him.  It is really this misunderstanding that, once perceived, serves best as a mirror for the ""masculine image"" that has been so harmful to both Steve and Alexandra.  The misunderstanding is, for us, what is being shown in an effort to reach understanding.",4,"Subtlety with a hammer - a devastating critique of male chauvinism under the guise of a ""good"" marriage",1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,2247,"['not', 'kind', 'film', 'one', 'loved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'again', 'not', 'even', 'kind', 'film', 'recommend', 'have', 'see', 'film', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'assume', 'would', 'be', 'true', 'are', 'male', 'female', 'nonetheless', 'powerful', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'misunderstood', 'were', 'merely', 'kind', 'female', 'revenge', 'picture', 'kill', 'bill', 'where', 'Alexandra', 'psyche', 'rather', 'body', 'even', 'compare', 'film', 'Japanese', 'film', 'Audition', 'would', 'be', 'serious', 'misunderstanding', 'One', 'latest', 'films', 'Australian', 'auteur', 'Rolf', 'de', 'Heer', 'Alexandra', 'project', 'nuanced', 'subtle', 'attack', 'ways', 'men', 'backed', 'up', 'cultural', 'myths', 'what', 'be', 'successful', 'man', 'objectify', 'women', 'lives', 'one', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'might', 'seem', 'sarcasm', 'nothing', 'subtle', 'Alexandra', 'project', 'extraordinarily', 'blunt', 'What', 'subtle', 'film', 'way', 'Rolf', 'Heer', 'how', 'easily', 'Steve', 'protagonist', 'victim', 'film', 'completely', 'point', 'message', 'how', 'fully', 'how', 'easy', 'share', 'misunderstanding', 'audience', 'member', 'despair', 'devastation', 'not', 'amount', 'realization', 'so', 'long', 'deliberately', 'misunderstood', 'denied', 'needs', 'believing', 'provide', 'enough', 'rather', 'feel', 'what', 'showing', 'own', 'masculine', 'lust', 'even', 'what', 'unmans', 'effectively', 'belief', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'was', 'feeling', 'lust', 'analogous', 'lust', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'be', 'problematic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'confused', 'effort', 'get', 'listen', 'least', 'as', 'painful', 'simultaneously', 'aroused', 'disgusted', 'only', 'disgust', 'herself', 'really', 'misunderstanding', 'once', 'perceived', 'best', 'mirror', 'masculine', 'image', 'been', 'so', 'harmful', 'Steve', 'Alexandra', 'misunderstanding', 'what', 'being', 'shown', 'effort', 'reach', 'understanding']",Alexandra's Project

882160,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0007LI10S,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","There's no denying that Alexandra's Project is a disappointment coming from Rolf de Heer, who made the superb The Tracker, one of the best Australian films of the decade. It's extremely well crafted and hides its low budget quite ingeniously, but unfortunately the birthday surprise that Gary Sweet gets from wife Helen Buday doesn't really hold together if you shake the package too much. Partially it's because the punishment seems far in excess of the crime, partially because you get the feeling that Rolf de Heer has been reading feminist literature just to compile a shopping list of grievances (most of them valid), but mainly because the holes in logic get bigger as the revenge grows out of proportion to the offence until the somewhat ridiculous climax: it's simply not credible even within the framework of the film. But the real problem is that you end up feeling sympathy for the husband for having the misfortune to marry so such wacko, which clearly is not the idea.There's still much to admire. De Heer sustains the suspense as to what exactly will happen while creating a plausible air of impending dread, the distortion from the anamorphic lenses on doorways and corridors adding to the sense that something's definitely off here, while Sweet is outstandingly good in a role that requires mainly reaction shots from an armchair. Buday is impressive too, but it's more an impressive ""performance"" with odd moments of truth rather than an entirely convincing human being in the way that Sweet's character is - more a fault of the agenda-led writing of her scenes than her own commendably brave efforts.The Australian special edition boasts a good selection of extras - 61-minute Q&A; session with De Heer, half-hour documentary, trailer and stills gallery.",3,"Nice try, but not quite there...",1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,1772,"['denying', 'Alexandra', 'Project', 'disappointment', 'coming', 'Rolf', 'de', 'Heer', 'who', 'made', 'superb', 'Tracker', 'one', 'best', 'Australian', 'films', 'decade', 'extremely', 'well', 'crafted', 'low', 'budget', 'quite', 'ingeniously', 'unfortunately', 'birthday', 'surprise', 'Gary', 'Sweet', 'wife', 'Helen', 'Buday', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'together', 'shake', 'package', 'too', 'much', 'Partially', 'punishment', 'far', 'excess', 'crime', 'partially', 'get', 'feeling', 'Rolf', 'de', 'Heer', 'been', 'reading', 'feminist', 'literature', 'just', 'compile', 'shopping', 'list', 'grievances', 'most', 'valid', 'mainly', 'holes', 'logic', 'get', 'bigger', 'revenge', 'proportion', 'offence', 'somewhat', 'ridiculous', 'climax', 'simply', 'not', 'credible', 'even', 'framework', 'film', 'real', 'problem', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'sympathy', 'husband', 'having', 'misfortune', 'marry', 'so', 'such', 'wacko', 'clearly', 'not', 'idea.There', 'still', 'much', 'admire', 'De', 'Heer', 'suspense', 'what', 'exactly', 'will', 'happen', 'creating', 'plausible', 'air', 'impending', 'dread', 'distortion', 'anamorphic', 'lenses', 'doorways', 'corridors', 'adding', 'sense', 'something', 'definitely', 'here', 'Sweet', 'outstandingly', 'good', 'role', 'mainly', 'reaction', 'shots', 'armchair', 'Buday', 'impressive', 'too', 'more', 'impressive', 'performance', 'odd', 'moments', 'truth', 'rather', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'human', 'being', 'way', 'Sweet', 'character', 'more', 'fault', 'agenda-led', 'writing', 'scenes', 'own', 'commendably', 'brave', 'efforts.The', 'Australian', 'special', 'edition', 'good', 'selection', 'extras', '61-minute', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'De', 'Heer', 'half-hour', 'documentary', 'trailer', 'stills', 'gallery']",Alexandra's Project
882161,A35PIBVA3XOWKO,B0007LI10S,Vera,"[15, 23]","Amazon is quite gracious in allowing reviewers the chance to rate the worst movies with only 1 star.  I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I must disagree with my other reviewers and state that if this is Rolfie boy's feminine side, I wish he wouldn't have found it in the first place.Actually, this movie is a feminist fantasy wrapped up in a pseudo-intellectual skirt posing as a commentary on contemporary relationships.  If Rolf wants to make porno, he should just make porno and not call it art! Also, he should not be preaching to us about how bad men are, enough already!The main character is a shallow, sad excuse for a woman and a mother.  Whatever happened to talking to your partner and telling them, 'I'm not happy and what are we going to do about it?' But NOOOO!  Ms. Alexandra has to become a hooker to get back at the man who she said, ""Married my body.""  And what did she marry? Is her husband fat, ugly, an ogre, does he look like Shrek on crack? Quite the opposite, he is a normal guy - just like 75% of the men out there, he's nothing special.Overall, Rolf de Heer must have been drunk when he made this piece of fetid tripe. If you like man-hating movies get it, if you want social commentary and entertainment, look elsewhere.",1,Rolf de Heer has a feminine side?,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,1279,"['Amazon', 'quite', 'gracious', 'allowing', 'reviewers', 'chance', 'rate', 'worst', 'movies', 'only', '1', 'star', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'must', 'disagree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'state', 'Rolfie', 'boy', 'feminine', 'side', 'wish', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'first', 'place.Actually', 'movie', 'feminist', 'fantasy', 'wrapped', 'up', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'skirt', 'posing', 'commentary', 'contemporary', 'relationships', 'Rolf', 'make', 'porno', 'should', 'just', 'make', 'porno', 'not', 'call', 'art', 'Also', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'preaching', 'how', 'bad', 'men', 'are', 'enough', 'already', 'main', 'character', 'shallow', 'sad', 'excuse', 'woman', 'mother', 'happened', 'talking', 'partner', 'telling', ""'m"", 'not', 'happy', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'NOOOO', 'Ms.', 'Alexandra', 'become', 'hooker', 'get', 'back', 'man', 'who', 'said', 'Married', 'body', 'what', 'did', 'marry', 'husband', 'fat', 'ugly', 'ogre', 'look', 'Shrek', 'crack', 'opposite', 'normal', 'guy', 'just', '75', '%', 'men', 'there', 'nothing', 'special.Overall', 'Rolf', 'de', 'Heer', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'drunk', 'when', 'made', 'piece', 'fetid', 'tripe', 'like', 'man-hating', 'movies', 'get', 'want', 'social', 'commentary', 'entertainment', 'look', 'elsewhere']",Alexandra's Project
