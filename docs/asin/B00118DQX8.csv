Tony Palmer's film left me wanting more -- to know more about his music and to listen to it.  On that basis I think that film must be rated a success.  In addition the scenic shots of England were beautiful.  Even with only a standard upscaling DVD player and a 53"" Sony SXRD HD Screen there was amazing clarity and vibrancy in the images presented.  Like other reviewers I felt that the final sequences of dead bodies and the horrors of war seemed a bit overblown and out of place, but in general I found this to be an amazing and moving work.",5,"beautiful music, beautiful shots of England",1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,630,"['knew', 'nothing', 'Ralph', 'Vaughan', 'Williams', 'have', 'heard', 'very', 'little', 'music', 'Tony', 'Palmer', 'film', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'know', 'more', 'music', 'listen', 'basis', 'think', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'rated', 'success', 'addition', 'scenic', 'shots', 'England', 'were', 'beautiful', 'Even', 'only', 'standard', 'upscaling', 'DVD', 'player', '53', 'Sony', 'SXRD', 'HD', 'Screen', 'was', 'amazing', 'clarity', 'vibrancy', 'images', 'presented', 'other', 'reviewers', 'felt', 'final', 'sequences', 'dead', 'bodies', 'horrors', 'war', 'seemed', 'bit', 'overblown', 'place', 'general', 'found', 'be', 'amazing', 'moving', 'work']",O Thou Transcendent: The Life of Ralph Vaughan Williams
1130546,A9XG9LCMY9DZP,B00118DQX8,John E. Martell Jr.,"[6, 7]","This is not so much a review as an opportunity to add five stars to this outstanding production. It deserves even more stars, were that possible.After seeing so many awful films biographies of Schubert, Beethoven, Chopin,Mozart, et. al. only a few great film biographies stand out in my mind, e.g.,  Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, Rachmaninoff. Now one more can be added to the list at or near the pinnacle. That is Palmer's, O Thou Transcendent. Some reviewers disagree, I see, but their reasons seem a bit superficial to me: for example an objection to the minute of carnage in a 2 1/2 hour film...not to forget that RVW was an ambulance driver and saw in real life a lot more than a few seconds of the bloody horrors of war and the death of very close friends who worked with him. No it is not pleasant. No, it may not be suitable for children. But when has war ever been?In this production we have a great balance of biographical material, interviews, and samples of the great variety of his works, wonderfully performed by Sian Edwards, Tamas Vasary and Sir Adrian Boult among others. Not only are the slections perfect for RVW, but here is an opportunity to listen to reflections by his second wife,Ursula, and of Sir Michael Tippett, Lord Armstrong, the composer Mark Anthony Turnage and Lady Barbarolli, among others. This is an extraordinary work of film- making about a great English composer. If you do not see it you will have missed 2 1/2 hours of pure delight.

1130547,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00118DQX8,Larry VanDeSande,"[2, 2]","Tony Palmer's lengthy (148 minutes) documentary on English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958) proceeds in a timeline from the composer's birth through his life, music and events and generously shares music videos and performances of the composer's work. As a composer that portrayed the devil inJob A Masque for Dancing, the vast emptiness of Antarctica inSymphony No. 7, and expressed controlled rage in theSymphony No. 6, Palmer wisely describes RVW as hardly the simple pastoralist many consider; an underlying tension in his music, the film shows, comes from his personal experience in the ambulance corps during World War I (where 6 of the 8 people he enlisted with were killed including fellow composer George Butterworth) and his sensitivity to his own and others' interpersonal conflicts.What keeps this film from being electric is its English pace and methodology, which is to say it's fairly slow and plays out in a predictably linear fashion. It has many affecting sections that underline the narration and first person commentary from RVW family members, friends and cohorts in the musical world. But the plain fact is this is a slow-moving documentary that occasionally borders on dullness. When I compare it to the last composer bio I watched,Khachaturian, the differences were stunning, day and night in terms of number of film clips used, overall pacing, and rapidity with which the parts accelerated.But, like the differences between the garish and sometimes superficial music from Aram Khachaturian and the more sophisticated and accomplished compositions from Ralph Vaughan Williams, this film has greater substance. There is more to discuss about this composer's life, much the reason it takes 2 hours and 28 minutes to say it all. What adds depth is RVW's personal agenda -- his despair over the Great War and the disappointment from his first marriage (the rage that led to the Symphony No. 4) -- that helped form his agenda.Though most know English folk music was one of RVW's driving forces, he was more than a painter of sentimental  musical portraits. Vaughan Williams regularly projects undercurrents of dissatisfaction, fear, even bleakness, sometimes in his works considered pastoral such as the Symphony No. 5, the Tallis Fantasy, or the Norfolk Rhapsody. When one listens to an appropriate reading of such music, likethis one, you can hear the tension beneath the nice veneer on top. This duality is commonplace in Vaughan Williams' music and this film helps you understand where the mismatch came from.The film includes testimony and performances from a lot of famous people -- conductors Adrian Boult, Sian Edwards and David Wilcocks, composers Michael Tippett and John Adams, the compser's wife Ursula and widows of Barbirolli and Holst, Mark Turnage, Jordi Savall, Simon Keenlyside, Joan Rogers and many others. The musical sections are more generous in this than most composer biographies and all are used to demonstrate his changing musicianship throughout his lifetime.I have one gripe about the production -- not enough onscreen titles. They don't always identify the music being played and, while most speakers are identified the first time they appear, if you forget them, you're not going to get much help remembering them in their next appearance. Created in 2007 for the 50th anniversary of the composer's death, this is, with some warts, a good addition to the list of composer bios. Anyone interested in Ralph Vaughan Williams the man or the composer will find something new here.",4,Too long but elucidates the essential RVW,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,3535,"['Tony', 'Palmer', 'lengthy', '148', 'minutes', 'documentary', 'English', 'composer', 'Ralph', 'Vaughan', 'Williams', '1872-1958', 'proceeds', 'timeline', 'composer', 'birth', 'life', 'music', 'events', 'generously', 'shares', 'music', 'videos', 'performances', 'composer', 'work', 'composer', 'portrayed', 'devil', 'inJob', 'A', 'Masque', 'Dancing', 'vast', 'emptiness', 'Antarctica', 'inSymphony', 'No', '7', 'expressed', 'controlled', 'rage', 'theSymphony', 'No', '6', 'Palmer', 'wisely', 'RVW', 'hardly', 'simple', 'pastoralist', 'many', 'consider', 'underlying', 'tension', 'music', 'film', 'shows', 'personal', 'experience', 'ambulance', 'corps', 'World', 'War', 'where', '6', '8', 'people', 'enlisted', 'were', 'killed', 'including', 'fellow', 'composer', 'George', 'Butterworth', 'sensitivity', 'own', 'others', 'interpersonal', 'conflicts.What', 'film', 'being', 'electric', 'English', 'pace', 'methodology', 'say', 'fairly', 'slow', 'out', 'predictably', 'linear', 'fashion', 'many', 'affecting', 'sections', 'underline', 'narration', 'first', 'person', 'commentary', 'RVW', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'cohorts', 'musical', 'world', 'plain', 'fact', 'slow-moving', 'documentary', 'occasionally', 'borders', 'dullness', 'When', 'compare', 'last', 'composer', 'bio', 'watched', 'Khachaturian', 'differences', 'were', 'stunning', 'day', 'night', 'terms', 'number', 'film', 'clips', 'used', 'overall', 'pacing', 'rapidity', 'parts', 'accelerated.But', 'differences', 'garish', 'sometimes', 'superficial', 'music', 'Aram', 'Khachaturian', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'accomplished', 'compositions', 'Ralph', 'Vaughan', 'Williams', 'film', 'greater', 'substance', 'more', 'discuss', 'composer', 'life', 'much', 'reason', '2', 'hours', '28', 'minutes', 'say', 'What', 'depth', 'RVW', 'personal', 'agenda', 'despair', 'Great', 'War', 'disappointment', 'first', 'marriage', 'rage', 'led', 'Symphony', 'No', '4', 'helped', 'form', 'agenda.Though', 'most', 'know', 'English', 'folk', 'music', 'was', 'one', 'RVW', 'driving', 'forces', 'was', 'more', 'painter', 'sentimental', 'musical', 'portraits', 'Vaughan', 'Williams', 'regularly', 'projects', 'undercurrents', 'dissatisfaction', 'fear', 'even', 'bleakness', 'sometimes', 'works', 'considered', 'pastoral', 'such', 'Symphony', 'No', '5', 'Tallis', 'Fantasy', 'Norfolk', 'Rhapsody', 'When', 'one', 'appropriate', 'reading', 'such', 'music', 'likethis', 'one', 'can', 'hear', 'tension', 'nice', 'veneer', 'top', 'duality', 'commonplace', 'Vaughan', 'Williams', 'music', 'film', 'understand', 'where', 'mismatch', 'came', 'from.The', 'film', 'testimony', 'performances', 'lot', 'famous', 'people', 'conductors', 'Adrian', 'Boult', 'Sian', 'Edwards', 'David', 'Wilcocks', 'composers', 'Michael', 'Tippett', 'John', 'Adams', 'compser', 'wife', 'Ursula', 'widows', 'Barbirolli', 'Holst', 'Mark', 'Turnage', 'Jordi', 'Savall', 'Simon', 'Keenlyside', 'Joan', 'Rogers', 'many', 'others', 'musical', 'sections', 'are', 'more', 'generous', 'most', 'composer', 'biographies', 'are', 'used', 'demonstrate', 'changing', 'musicianship', 'lifetime.I', 'have', 'one', 'gripe', 'production', 'not', 'enough', 'onscreen', 'titles', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'identify', 'music', 'being', 'played', 'most', 'speakers', 'are', 'identified', 'first', 'time', 'appear', 'forget', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'much', 'help', 'remembering', 'next', 'appearance', 'Created', '2007', '50th', 'anniversary', 'composer', 'death', 'warts', 'good', 'addition', 'list', 'composer', 'bios', 'Anyone', 'interested', 'Ralph', 'Vaughan', 'Williams', 'man', 'composer', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'here']",O Thou Transcendent: The Life of Ralph Vaughan Williams
1130548,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,B00118DQX8,T. Fisher,"[5, 6]","OK, I'll admit it. Call me shallow and sentimental, call me a lover of pastoral fluff. But Ralph Vaughan Williams is my favorite composer. There you have it.Until I saw this treat of a documentary, however, I knew surprisingly little about the man. For me he was a black box, out of which came sounds that epitomized 20th century English composition in all its non-Continental, non-intellectualized glory.And for the record, as the film points out, and as anyone who actually listens to Vaughan Williams will tell you, his music goes far beyond pastoral fluff. There is real darkness there as well, reflecting his experience in World War I and the turbulence of World War II -- not to mention difficulties in his first marriage. One family eyewitness, for example, calls his 4th Symphony a ""rage"" against his first wife.That is the kind of first-hand familiarity with the subject that this documentary is filled with. It is a welcome relief to have not only experts and biographers, but also friends, associates and family members commenting on Vaughan Williams' life and work. (Not to mention quite a few spliced-in voiceovers by Vaughan Williams himself.) The same type of first-hand knowledge was also characteristic of the only other Tony Palmer documentary I have seen to date -- his treatment ofMaria Callas. I plan to look up more of Palmer's classical documentaries.Other reviewers have complained about the graphic images of suffering children contained in the film, which are intended to convey the horrors that lie behind the composer's work. I can see their point. The images are gratuitous and they were a mistake in this film. But not a fatal one. Overall, this is a great work for anyone interested in Vaughan Williams and his music.

1130549,A2GWY78Y3YZ1I6,B00118DQX8,Transfigured Knight,"[6, 17]","""O Thou Transcendent: The Life of Ralph Vaughan Williams"" has to be one of the worst documentaries I've seen in a long time. From start to finish, there was nothing of remote substance found. The interview segments made absolutely no sense and didn't even pertain to the subject matter about 99% of the time. The editing, or lack of, was terrible as it was completely cut-up and very erratic. The entire documentary didn't follow any kind of timeline at all. The stories told from the various people being interviewed made absolutely no sense and were more of a personal nature and not much in the way of Vaughan Williams' actual history. The images involved throughout were very distasteful, which I'm sure this has been mentioned, but there were several images that were totally uncalled for like the images of a dead child and not to mention stacks of dead bodies, which are out-of-place in this type of documentary, which is supposed to be about Vaughan Williams and not trying to provoke controversy.That said, I can't possibly think of one good thing to say about this pathetic excuse for a documentary other than I wish I had the 2+ hours back from watching this film. If you are expecting a documentary that follows a timeline and that deals with Vaughan Williams' life in a competent way, then do not watch this.

1130550,A3ADK3ZTJ87915,B00118DQX8,"Zinta Aistars ""Writer & Editor""","[41, 42]","When a British friend asked what I knew of classic British composer, R. Vaughan Williams, I blinked. That would be ... nothing. Although, as it turned out, when he speedily sent me a two-and-a-half-hour video to educate me, I did know more than nothing. I just didn't know that I knew. But as the documentary unfolded, my ear picked up a string of symphonies and a few sweeter melodies that I had known quite well. Only, shame on me, without giving due credit.So this is R. Vaughan Williams. With gorgeous scenery that made me want to book a ticket to the United Kingdom, but now, as backdrop, a kind of mix of biography and history  and imagined perception (the composer's) unfolded. This is the place and time that formed the musician that created the music. Indeed, to know and see all of this enriches understanding and appreciation of the music. Williams is often called a composer of folk melodies with a classical slant, but the documentary, interspersing soaring orchestras with crashing waves--the Sea Symphonies were easily my favorite--and gruesome war scenes and interview snippets with doddering, elderly British ladies, speaking of the composer's bushy eyebrows and tormented marriage (he loved his wife, but soon after marriage, her failing health became a primary issue), proves the point most eloquently that Williams is far more than folk tune composer. He is a composer on a grand scale. He has written scores for movies in his time, music that climbs mountains and builds suspense and melts into romance. He has composed symphonies that are complex and gorgeous. He can write the sweet melody that resonates in your mind all day long, but he can also write the sweep of crashing symphony that shakes the listener to the core ... as only powerful music can.The video is long and highly detailed, but a visual treat as well as informative.
