Of course I recognized Zac Efron having been in the receiving age group of the Disney Channel Soul Suckers (kidding, but only just), his existence went right over my head and I was instead drawn to Christian McKay (who at the time of this review still has a startlingly slim imdb record *cough* SOMEONE GIVE THE MAN A LEAD IN EVERY MOVIE THERE IS GOING TO BE *uncough*) - because in the two and a half minutes the trailer had to sway me I was convinced that he was already a very accomplished veteran actor I had somehow missed. I found a link, watched the movie online, and bought it the very next day.The story goes as follows: Richard (Efron) is a bored schoolboy who miraculously talks his way into getting a bit part in an Orson Welles (Christian McKay) production of Caesar, at which point he is quickly shafted to the responsibility of Sonja (Claire Danes). Richard is clumsy, bouncing from one mishap (theatre sprinklers) to another (losing props), and is played well enough by Zac Efron that I forgot this was one of Disney's Golden Boys who are To Pretty to Be by definition, and enjoyed Zac Efron, the actor. Sonja answers phone calls, annotates novels and, driven by the ambition to actually get a paycheck for the work she does, goes on multiple dates with the men of the company - but strictly to get ahead, as she is the Only Sane (wo)Man in the movie.And then there is Orson Welles. When he is on screen the film is interesting, engaging, and had me gnawing on my lip in anticipation, when he isn't it does lull a bit, but that could just be my perspective. Orson Welles has been called a prodigy, an egomaniac, a genius, a failure. Fistfuls of adjectives float around his name like clouds that could either lead to heaven's gates or burst and release buckets of water. He was just a man really, and Christian McKay plays him as such - a brilliant, artistic, charismatic man who could be immature, vain, amusing, terrifying and constantly at odds with someone or something.Associates include Eddie Marsan as John Houseman, James Tupper as Joseph Cotten, Leo Bill as Norman Lloyd, and Ben Chaplin as George Coulouris as members of the Mercury Theatre.This isn't historically accurate, it isn't a flawless film, and if you are looking for problems you will probably find one - but it is a great movie (great enough to snag a 4 star review from Roger Ebert), which provides a great performance by the man playing The Great Man.",5,Orson Welles played by a magnificent unknown and Me played by a moderate known,1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,2619,"['came', 'trailer', 'film', 'youtube', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'who', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'was', 'not', 'director', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'how', 'critics', 'had', 'responded', 'course', 'recognized', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'having', 'been', 'receiving', 'age', 'group', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Soul', 'Suckers', 'kidding', 'only', 'just', 'existence', 'went', 'right', 'head', 'was', 'instead', 'drawn', 'Christian', 'McKay', 'who', 'time', 'review', 'still', 'startlingly', 'slim', 'imdb', 'record', '*cough*', 'SOMEONE', 'GIVE', 'THE', 'MAN', 'A', 'LEAD', 'IN', 'EVERY', 'MOVIE', 'THERE', 'GOING', 'TO', 'BE', '*uncough*', 'two', 'half', 'minutes', 'trailer', 'had', 'sway', 'was', 'convinced', 'was', 'already', 'very', 'accomplished', 'veteran', 'actor', 'had', 'somehow', 'missed', 'found', 'link', 'watched', 'movie', 'online', 'bought', 'very', 'next', 'day.The', 'story', 'Richard', 'Efron', 'bored', 'schoolboy', 'who', 'miraculously', 'way', 'getting', 'bit', 'part', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Christian', 'McKay', 'production', 'Caesar', 'point', 'quickly', 'shafted', 'responsibility', 'Sonja', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Richard', 'clumsy', 'bouncing', 'one', 'mishap', 'theatre', 'sprinklers', 'losing', 'props', 'played', 'well', 'enough', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'forgot', 'was', 'one', 'Disney', 'Golden', 'Boys', 'who', 'are', 'Pretty', 'Be', 'definition', 'enjoyed', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'actor', 'Sonja', 'phone', 'calls', 'novels', 'driven', 'ambition', 'actually', 'get', 'paycheck', 'work', 'multiple', 'dates', 'men', 'company', 'strictly', 'get', 'ahead', 'Only', 'Sane', 'wo', 'Man', 'movie.And', 'then', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'When', 'screen', 'film', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'had', 'gnawing', 'lip', 'anticipation', 'when', ""n't"", 'lull', 'bit', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'perspective', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'been', 'called', 'prodigy', 'egomaniac', 'genius', 'failure', 'Fistfuls', 'adjectives', 'float', 'name', 'clouds', 'could', 'either', 'lead', 'heaven', 'gates', 'burst', 'release', 'buckets', 'water', 'was', 'just', 'man', 'really', 'Christian', 'McKay', 'such', 'brilliant', 'artistic', 'charismatic', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'immature', 'vain', 'amusing', 'terrifying', 'constantly', 'odds', 'someone', 'something.Associates', 'include', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'John', 'Houseman', 'James', 'Tupper', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Leo', 'Bill', 'Norman', 'Lloyd', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'George', 'Coulouris', 'members', 'Mercury', 'Theatre.This', ""n't"", 'historically', 'accurate', ""n't"", 'flawless', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'problems', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'one', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'enough', 'snag', '4', 'star', 'review', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'great', 'performance', 'man', 'playing', 'Great', 'Man']",N/A

The story is told through the eyes of a fictional character, Richard Samuels, played beautifully by Zac Efron, a young man who lucks into the part of Lucius after encountering the Mercury Theatre Company, and Welles, in the street.Both in form and in content there are strong echoes of ""Shakespeare in Love"", but with the startling originality of Christian McKay's performance as Welles, which captures Welle's genius, charm, ego, pettiness and ruthlessness in a seemingly effortless sweep. The movie is worth watching for this alone, but it also has much else to recommend it: a deeply entertaining behind the scenes account of the production of a great play; a touching portrait of a youthful affair between the lovely Clare Danes and Efron; and the great Eddie Marsden, who has over the years produced some memorable performances as terrifying characters, here playing the gentleman that was John Houseman.The looming tragedy of World War 2 is underplayed in favour of a sense of youthful hope in the spite of the encroaching fear and disappointment: even the worst circumstances are replete with possibilities as Efron's character ultimately learns.",4,Welles was a genius... even if he did say so himself!,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,1269,"['immensely', 'entertaining', 'film', 'focussing', 'rehersals', 'Welles', 'legendary', 'production', 'Julius', 'Caesar', '1937', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'fictional', 'character', 'Richard', 'Samuels', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'part', 'Lucius', 'encountering', 'Mercury', 'Theatre', 'Company', 'Welles', 'street.Both', 'form', 'content', 'are', 'strong', 'echoes', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'startling', 'originality', 'Christian', 'McKay', 'performance', 'Welles', 'Welle', 'genius', 'charm', 'ego', 'pettiness', 'ruthlessness', 'seemingly', 'effortless', 'sweep', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'alone', 'also', 'much', 'else', 'recommend', 'deeply', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'account', 'production', 'great', 'play', 'touching', 'portrait', 'youthful', 'affair', 'lovely', 'Clare', 'Danes', 'Efron', 'great', 'Eddie', 'Marsden', 'who', 'years', 'produced', 'memorable', 'performances', 'terrifying', 'characters', 'here', 'playing', 'gentleman', 'was', 'John', 'Houseman.The', 'looming', 'tragedy', 'World', 'War', '2', 'underplayed', 'favour', 'sense', 'youthful', 'hope', 'spite', 'encroaching', 'fear', 'disappointment', 'even', 'worst', 'circumstances', 'are', 'replete', 'possibilities', 'Efron', 'character', 'ultimately']",N/A

No mere portrayal, McKay IS Orson Welles in every conceivable manner - egotistical bombast, supreme confidence, imposing physical stature, imperious countenance, life on a high-wire.  They invented the expression 'tour de force' for this type of performance (and, indeed, I see one of the spotlight reviewers beat me to that turn of phrase.  I second that.)Efron is likable enough, as is the always winsome and adorable Claire Danes.

176733,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,1419897543,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[4, 4]","Orson Welles was the most charismatic, outrageous, brilliant, egotistical, and fascinating artist of his generation, an 'enfant terrible' who was hailed as a creative genius in his 20s, yet effectively 'shut out' as anything more than an actor for most of the rest of his life. His 'glory years', from the mid-1930s until the release of ""Citizen Kane"", in 1941, have produced a number of memorable films and great Welles' impersonations, including those of Liev Schreiber, Angus MacFadyen, and Vincent D'Onofrio (who was dubbed), but I must admit, the best film and Welles' interpretion I've seen is Richard Linklater's wonderful ""Me & Orson Welles"", with Christian McKay, physically and vocally 'dead-on' as Welles.Based on Robert Kaplow's novel, the film traces the birth of the Mercury Theatre, in 1937, and 22-year-old Welles' unorthodox staging of their first project, a fascist, Nazi-themed version of Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"", in the final days before the debut. As seen through the eyes of a 17-year-old novice actor, Richard Samuels (Zac Efron, looking very much like a young Tyrone Power), Welles is a force of nature, verbally fencing with his creative partner, John Houseman (Eddie Marsan), chasing women as vigorously as actor/pal Joe Cotton (an equally dead-on James Tupper), and dealing with tempermental 'Mark Antony' George Coulouris (Ben Chaplin, icily droll). Samuels is befriended by funny, unpredictable Norman Lloyd (Leo Bill, in yet another 'dead-on' portrayal), and becomes involved with two remarkable women, young writer Gretta Adler (Zoe Kazan, granddaughter of Elia Kazan), and Welles' assistant, Sonja Jones (Clare Danes, in a very likable performance). The glue that holds everything together is clearly Welles, and Christian McKay is simply mesmerizing, a slightly pudgy, saucer-eyed, self-centered, yet undoubtedly brighter person than everyone else. He has his Mercury company completely in awe (despite more than a few secretly hating him), and he pulls the entire theatre world of the time to a level no one had ever experienced before (not even Welles!)...His vision would change the world, and the film captures the times, perfectly.If you are a Welles fan, or 1930's Broadway, or the actors of the era, you are in for a treat...Don't miss this one.""Me & Orson Welles"" is a winner!",5,"The Best 'Orson Welles' Film, Yet!",1282694400,"08 25, 2010",2010,2323,"['Orson', 'Welles', 'was', 'most', 'charismatic', 'outrageous', 'brilliant', 'egotistical', 'fascinating', 'artist', 'generation', ""'enfant"", 'terrible', 'who', 'was', 'hailed', 'creative', 'genius', '20s', 'yet', 'effectively', ""'shut"", 'out', 'anything', 'more', 'actor', 'most', 'rest', 'life', ""'glory"", 'years', 'mid-1930s', 'release', 'Citizen', 'Kane', '1941', 'have', 'produced', 'number', 'memorable', 'films', 'great', 'Welles', 'impersonations', 'including', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Angus', 'MacFadyen', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'who', 'was', 'dubbed', 'must', 'admit', 'best', 'film', 'Welles', 'interpretion', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'wonderful', 'Me', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Christian', 'McKay', 'physically', 'vocally', ""'dead-on"", 'Welles.Based', 'Robert', 'Kaplow', 'novel', 'film', 'birth', 'Mercury', 'Theatre', '1937', '22-year-old', 'Welles', 'unorthodox', 'staging', 'first', 'project', 'fascist', 'Nazi-themed', 'version', 'Shakespeare', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'final', 'days', 'debut', 'seen', 'eyes', '17-year-old', 'novice', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Samuels', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'looking', 'very', 'much', 'young', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'Welles', 'force', 'nature', 'verbally', 'fencing', 'creative', 'partner', 'John', 'Houseman', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'chasing', 'women', 'as', 'vigorously', 'actor/pal', 'Joe', 'Cotton', 'equally', 'dead-on', 'James', 'Tupper', 'dealing', 'tempermental', ""'Mark"", 'Antony', 'George', 'Coulouris', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'icily', 'droll', 'Samuels', 'befriended', 'funny', 'unpredictable', 'Norman', 'Lloyd', 'Leo', 'Bill', 'yet', ""'dead-on"", 'portrayal', 'involved', 'two', 'remarkable', 'women', 'young', 'writer', 'Gretta', 'Adler', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'granddaughter', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Welles', 'assistant', 'Sonja', 'Jones', 'Clare', 'Danes', 'very', 'likable', 'performance', 'glue', 'everything', 'together', 'clearly', 'Welles', 'Christian', 'McKay', 'simply', 'mesmerizing', 'slightly', 'pudgy', 'saucer-eyed', 'self-centered', 'yet', 'undoubtedly', 'brighter', 'person', 'everyone', 'else', 'Mercury', 'company', 'completely', 'awe', 'more', 'few', 'secretly', 'hating', 'entire', 'theatre', 'world', 'time', 'level', 'one', 'had', 'ever', 'experienced', 'not', 'even', 'Welles', 'vision', 'would', 'change', 'world', 'film', 'times', 'perfectly.If', 'are', 'Welles', 'fan', '1930', 'Broadway', 'actors', 'era', 'are', 'treat', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'Me', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'winner']",N/A

It's directed by Richard Linklater, who is one of my favorite directors.The story takes place in New York City in 1937. Richard Samuels, played brilliantly by the magnetic Zac Efron, is a high school student who is almost 18 when he's cast in an Orson Welles production of Shakespeare's Caesar at the Mercury Theater. Naturally, his youthful ignorance and idealism are tested while working with the brilliant egomaniac Welles, played quite well by Christian McKay, who was nominated for an IFC Independent Spirit award for the role. Richard also falls for Sonja, played by a surprisingly mediocre Claire Danes.While the film was good, the trailer did it a disservice. There were clips of almost every scene in the trailer, but the trailer juxtaposed them differently. As I watched the film, I heard the next line of the trailer in my head, but the scenes themselves were different in the movie. It was jarring. The trailer told too much, so there were few punches or moments of surprise left. Quite honestly, the script wasn't strong enough to hold up when the audience already knew what happened. My advice? Don't watch the trailer.Overall, it's a lovely little film, and it's certainly worth watching, especially to see Zac Efron. He is a star. He was the star of the film, but he has that je ne sais quois, and I could not take my eyes off of him when he was on screen.

176737,AN9J46667D80O,1419897543,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[38, 39]","Orson Welles was a genius in many, many areas. He was an incredible actor, a brilliant director and a showman of the first order. He was also, from many accounts, a major jerk; obsessive and controlling, manipulative and unpleasant. Someone who at least as nasty to his friends as to his enemies. He was, to lift a quote from a certain movie, not a brutal man, but a man who did brutal things.All these elements of his considerable personality are on display in Richard Linkletter's newest film, Me and Orson Welles. The movie tells the story of a seventeen-year-old boy named Richard (though he's mostly referred to as ""Junior""). He's played by Zac Efron (looking sexier than ever), in his finest role to date, which isn't saying a lot.Richard is a reasonably naive boy who winds up meeting Welles as the great man is preparing for his 1937 stage production of Julius Caesar, a ground-breaking presentation that moved the story into modern times, dressing the cast in fascist uniforms and casting an obvious Jew as the poet Cinna. Richard ends up in the play as a servant to Welles' Brutus, a role which requires him to learn to play the ukulele after claiming he already knew how.Richard meets all the famous players of the Mercury Theatre, most notably Joseph Cotton, Norman Lloyd and George Coulouris. He also meets, and falls in love with, the beautiful Sonja Jones (Claire Danes). Like Richard, she's a fictional character, and also like Richard, she's far less interesting than the real characters around them.The movie is completely stolen by Christian McKay's performance as Welles. It is as letter-perfect as any I've ever seen. He has the look, he has the voice and he has the attitude of Welles, playing him as a man who never bothered to merely speak when he could instead declaim. He simply is Welles, warts and all. Expect his performance to get a Best Supporting Actor nomination, and probable win, at the next Oscars.This is probably the best movie I've seen this year, with Up in the Air as a very close second. The movie captures the spirit of the theatre and the character of Welles like no movie I've ever seen before. I cannot possibly praise it enough. It might be hard to find in your area (it's considered something of an art film), but if you can track it down, it's well worth seeing.",5,A stunning performance!,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,2311,"['Orson', 'Welles', 'was', 'genius', 'many', 'many', 'areas', 'was', 'incredible', 'actor', 'brilliant', 'director', 'showman', 'first', 'order', 'was', 'also', 'many', 'accounts', 'major', 'jerk', 'obsessive', 'controlling', 'manipulative', 'unpleasant', 'Someone', 'who', 'least', 'nasty', 'friends', 'enemies', 'was', 'lift', 'quote', 'certain', 'movie', 'not', 'brutal', 'man', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'brutal', 'things.All', 'elements', 'considerable', 'personality', 'are', 'display', 'Richard', 'Linkletter', 'newest', 'film', 'Me', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'movie', 'story', 'seventeen-year-old', 'boy', 'named', 'Richard', 'mostly', 'referred', 'Junior', 'played', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'looking', 'sexier', 'ever', 'finest', 'role', 'date', ""n't"", 'saying', 'lot.Richard', 'reasonably', 'naive', 'boy', 'who', 'up', 'meeting', 'Welles', 'great', 'man', 'preparing', '1937', 'stage', 'production', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'ground-breaking', 'presentation', 'moved', 'story', 'modern', 'times', 'dressing', 'cast', 'fascist', 'uniforms', 'casting', 'obvious', 'Jew', 'poet', 'Cinna', 'Richard', 'up', 'play', 'servant', 'Welles', 'Brutus', 'role', 'learn', 'play', 'ukulele', 'claiming', 'already', 'knew', 'how.Richard', 'meets', 'famous', 'players', 'Mercury', 'Theatre', 'most', 'notably', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'Norman', 'Lloyd', 'George', 'Coulouris', 'also', 'love', 'beautiful', 'Sonja', 'Jones', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Richard', 'fictional', 'character', 'also', 'like', 'Richard', 'far', 'less', 'interesting', 'real', 'characters', 'them.The', 'movie', 'completely', 'stolen', 'Christian', 'McKay', 'performance', 'Welles', 'as', 'letter-perfect', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'look', 'voice', 'attitude', 'Welles', 'playing', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'bothered', 'merely', 'speak', 'when', 'could', 'instead', 'declaim', 'simply', 'Welles', 'warts', 'Expect', 'performance', 'get', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'probable', 'win', 'next', 'Oscars.This', 'probably', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Up', 'Air', 'very', 'close', 'second', 'movie', 'spirit', 'theatre', 'character', 'Welles', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'praise', 'enough', 'might', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'area', 'considered', 'something', 'art', 'film', 'can', 'track', 'down', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

176743,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,1419897543,Ed Uyeshima,"[12, 13]","I wish this small-scale 2009 indie focused far more on the most charismatic person in the cast. Foreboding with a glaring certainty and a penchant for spewing venom at anyone he deems unworthy of his attention, Christian McKay makes the young Orson Welles come alive as the intimidating megalomaniac he had to have been to create a masterpiece likeCitizen Kane. In 1937, he was only 22 when he mounted a contemporary version of Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"" with his legendary troupe, the Mercury Theater, which showcased his prodigious theatrical genius, and his idiosyncratic blend of swagger and insight transcended the backstage chaos that would yield a stage triumph. Welles was the type of man who would shower his cast with hyperbolic praise and then just as suddenly, crush them with harsh criticism.However, director Richard Linklater (Dazed & Confused), usually not a specialist in period pieces, chooses to focus on the fictional character of 17-year-old Richard Samuels to carry the plot as he witnesses Welles' genius firsthand as a prot&eacute;g&eacute;-turned-actor. Filmmaker Cameron Crowe tried the same perspective shift in 2000'sAlmost Famous, but the device doesn't work as well this time. It's not that teen heartthrob Zac Efron is bad in the role. In fact, he brings an enthusiastic sincerity to his comparatively shallow role, but the dominance of McKay's towering performance provides an imbalance that is difficult to ignore. Holly Gent Palmo and Vince Palmo's screenplay focuses on Richard's brush with greatness during the process of making art, and cineastes will enjoy the likes of Joseph Cotten, John Houseman and George Colouris portrayed with relish and surprising accuracy by James Tupper, Eddie Marsan and Ben Chaplin, respectively.Of course, there are women to complicate matters among the troupe, and Mercury production manager Sonja Jones is both a beguiling and ambitious presence that endlessly fascinates the actors swirling around her. Needless to say, Richard is smitten, but she has plans of her own to consider. Claire Danes gives a smart, incisive performance as Sonja, giving her more depth than one would expect from the story. Zoe Kazan bookends the movie as an aspiring writer who believes she has found a kindred artistic spirit in Richard. Laurence Dorman's production design and Dick Pope's cinematography deserve mention as the combination evokes the film's period setting with conviction. But this is McKay's movie all the way and well worth seeing for his astonishing turn.",4,It's Welles' World and Everyone Else Just Exists in It Thanks to McKay's Masterful Turn,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,2528,"['wish', 'small-scale', '2009', 'indie', 'focused', 'far', 'more', 'most', 'charismatic', 'person', 'cast', 'Foreboding', 'glaring', 'certainty', 'penchant', 'spewing', 'venom', 'anyone', 'unworthy', 'attention', 'Christian', 'McKay', 'young', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'come', 'alive', 'intimidating', 'megalomaniac', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'create', 'masterpiece', 'likeCitizen', 'Kane', '1937', 'was', 'only', '22', 'when', 'mounted', 'contemporary', 'version', 'Shakespeare', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'legendary', 'troupe', 'Mercury', 'Theater', 'showcased', 'prodigious', 'theatrical', 'genius', 'idiosyncratic', 'blend', 'swagger', 'insight', 'transcended', 'backstage', 'chaos', 'would', 'yield', 'stage', 'triumph', 'Welles', 'was', 'type', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'shower', 'cast', 'hyperbolic', 'praise', 'then', 'just', 'suddenly', 'crush', 'harsh', 'criticism.However', 'director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'usually', 'not', 'specialist', 'period', 'pieces', 'chooses', 'focus', 'fictional', 'character', '17-year-old', 'Richard', 'Samuels', 'carry', 'plot', 'Welles', 'genius', 'firsthand', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', '-turned-actor', 'Filmmaker', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'tried', 'same', 'perspective', 'shift', ""2000'sAlmost"", 'Famous', 'device', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'not', 'teen', 'heartthrob', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'bad', 'role', 'fact', 'enthusiastic', 'sincerity', 'comparatively', 'shallow', 'role', 'dominance', 'McKay', 'towering', 'performance', 'imbalance', 'difficult', 'ignore', 'Holly', 'Gent', 'Palmo', 'Vince', 'Palmo', 'screenplay', 'Richard', 'brush', 'greatness', 'process', 'making', 'art', 'cineastes', 'will', 'enjoy', 'likes', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'John', 'Houseman', 'George', 'Colouris', 'portrayed', 'relish', 'surprising', 'accuracy', 'James', 'Tupper', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'respectively.Of', 'course', 'are', 'women', 'complicate', 'matters', 'troupe', 'Mercury', 'production', 'manager', 'Sonja', 'Jones', 'beguiling', 'ambitious', 'presence', 'endlessly', 'actors', 'swirling', 'Needless', 'say', 'Richard', 'smitten', 'plans', 'own', 'consider', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'smart', 'incisive', 'performance', 'Sonja', 'giving', 'more', 'depth', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'story', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'movie', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'who', 'found', 'kindred', 'artistic', 'spirit', 'Richard', 'Laurence', 'Dorman', 'production', 'design', 'Dick', 'Pope', 'cinematography', 'deserve', 'mention', 'combination', 'film', 'period', 'setting', 'conviction', 'McKay', 'movie', 'way', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'astonishing', 'turn']",N/A

Perfectionists can't work with anyone other than themselves and expect to have things done their way.  Unfortunately, they can't do it alone and they require constant fawning.  This is never a good combination; as depicted in this movie it's thoroughly repugnant behavior, often cruel and cowardly.  This brings up a very good question; can you separate the person from their work?  Is their work any less special because they turn out to be reprehensible creeps?  I wish this film had dealt more with that paradox but it didn't.  Instead, we are given a constricted glimpse of an artist early in his life/career from the view point of a few people struggling with their own circumstances.  None of the characters are truly fleshed out but they often come close enough to satisfy.  Christian McKay is especially convincing as a young Orson Welles.  Zac Efron plays a young hopeful who falls under Orson's sway and as the other half of the quotient (me), Zac acquits himself admirably (I wasn't expecting much from him going into this and so was pleasantly surprised to discover he wasn't bad).  As for Claire Danes, I don't understand why she was cast in what is ostensibly a castoff role as a tough cookie with plans of her own.  She didn't quite fit the part because she has this permanent look of nervous worry etched into every glance.  Talking and trying to act tough just didn't work for her, nor did acting like an opportunist.Filmed in 2008, this film struggled to find distribution in 2009, eventually going to DVD in 2010, an ""exclusive"" at Target stores.

He is an eloquent reviewer of cinema.  But when he said ""ME AND ORSON WELLES is one of the best movies about the theater I've ever seen"" it is hard to believe him.There are truly some magnificent movies about the theater, and this is NOT one of them. My number one choice would be ""The Dresser"" with Tom Courtenay. Another good choice is ""The Entertainer"" with Laurence Olivier. And the role of theater in the lives of amateur performers is very well told in ""Shakespeare Behind Bars"" or ""Trust - Second Acts in Young Lives."" And there are all the wonderful extras on DVD with interviews of the greats: Richard Burton, Laurence Olivier, Sir Alec Guinness, or Claire Bloom.  Another top choice might be the mini-series: ""Playing Shakespeare"".  Now these films DO HONESTLY teach us about the theater.  ""Me and Orson Welles"" does not.I will concede that Christian McKay gave a standout performance as Orson Welles. There were moments when I could not tell him apart from the real actor.  He deserves a great amount of credit for his excellent characterization.  But the film as a whole?  Well,  Zac Effron's acting was lukewarm, at best.  He seemed to be just another ""pretty face"" on the screen. When he voiced Shakespeare, I cringed.Another problem with the movie is that the random moments of ""Julius Caesar"" acted on screen show nothing of the genius of the play as produced by Orson Welles. Was Welles' genius just selecting Italian Fascist costumes for the actors?  Obviously it was much more.  All the readings of ""Julius Caesar"" in the film were flat. Nothing touched the soul. I understood more about the theater when I watched the DVD 'Julius Caesar"" with James Mason, Marlon Brando, and other exceptional actors.Other reviewers have argued that there is lot more to Orson Welles than presented in the film. Manipulative...he must have been. But Orson Welles actually comes across as mean spirited in the film.  Self centered - yes - but mean spirited?  I am not prepared to go that far.Different reviewers have different tastes.

176751,A328S9RN3U5M68,1419897543,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","There are many things to love about ME AND ORSON WELLES, a dip into the past of the USA circa 1937 when despite the Great Depression and the imminence of WW II life upon the wicked stage held the fascination for a group of people determined to become stars. Adapted from the novel by Robert Kaplow by Holly Gent Palmo and Vincent Palmo Jr. and directed by Richard Linklater, this film reminds us of what the movies of the 1940s were like - hazy, musically inclined, optimistic views of the future played out on the streets and backstages of New York.  It is not a deep film, but it is delivered by an excellent cast, and if the first half drags a bit, the second half more than makes up for those flaws.Orson Welles (played brilliantly by British actor Christian McKay) is fixing up the old Mercury theater for a performance of Shakespeare's JULIUS CAESAR.  His crew of actors understands the idiosyncrasies of the brilliant theatrical genius and realizes that despite his at times vicious steaks of grandiose personality megalomania that he is indeed a genius and to work with him 'close enough to be sprayed by his spit' is an honor.  His secretary Sonja Jones (Claire Danes) is wise and knows what it takes to step up the ladder in show business.  When a young student Richard Samuels (Zac Efron) appears, Jones helps him land an audition with the great Welles and Richard is given a bit part in the play.  The story concerns the machinations of backstage drama that surrounds theater life: the cast members include Ben Chaplin, Kelly Reilly, James Tupper, and Leo Bill among others and the theater manager John Houseman is played by Eddie Marsan.  There are the expected sidebars of love affairs - Efron and Danes, Efron and Zoe Kazan (playing would-be writer Gretta Adler), confrontations of strong personalities, opening night decompensations, superstitions that surround the theater - and these asides are just that: unnecessary moments of digression for the appreciation of what Orson Welles was all about.  The true glory of the film is the manner in which the magician Welles is able to tidy up last minute details and present a production of JULIUS CAESAR that is far ahead of its time and praised by the press and the public.  After opening night the tension among the actors alters and the choices each makes creates a fine ending for the cinematic biography.The musical score is rich in excerpts from the period popular songs as well as a fine score by Michael J. McEvoy.  The cinematography that captures the flavor of the 30s - long shots down on the streets from high buildings, the creaky dank theater mood, and the choice of bathing everything in a slightly umber tone - is mastered by Dick Pope.  The cast is uniformly fine, but it is the performance of Christian McKay that, just as Orson Welles dominated the world in the places he stood, proves that McKay is a brilliant actor to watch carefully.  It is a very good show, not a great one, but a solid look at the life and colleagues of a great man.

Christian McKay as Welles was perfect, capturing an arrogant, insufferable, deceitful egomaniac with &eacute;lan. He has clearly watched ""The Third Man"" a few times. James Tupper was a better Joseph Cotton than Joe was. Cotton was a wooden actor with zero presence. Mr Tupper was an utterly believable shark. Very. Claire Danes, whom I don't think I've ever seen in anything, which is probably illegal, was wonderful. Eddie Marsan is one of my favorite character actors. He is always amazing, and was absolutely captivating here. He just chewed up every scene he was in. But Zac Efron was a limp rag. I guess he's somebody, though he is unknown to me. But I found him boring. Not a drop of magnetism or energy, despite the motions and exuberance and dancing and shy smiles. A dull, dull boy.And then it ended with one of my favorite songs from the 30s, ""The Music Goes Round and Round"" with the sultry Edythe Wright on vocals.This was a devastating portrait of a man, much like Caesar, who was so in love with himself and his vision that he happily crushed anything that impeded his progress. A man who would be king, who demanded total loyalty and obedience, who used and misused, who lied and cheated but who conveniently lived in a world where talent excused such malevolence. And who never got the knife Caesar did. But a loathsome and foul man, a man who believed creating art was the highest goal in life. It wasn't.

I viewed the 2009 film ME AND ORSON WELLES twice but rate it 3-1/2 stars, rounding off to four here, though you'd think any movie you want to see again deserves closer to five.  But if you browse other reviews, like many I find Christian McKay's performance as creative prodigy Orson Welles mesmerizing and if nothing else the reason to recommend this title.  I looked up the 2009 Best Supporting Actor nominees and while I did not view the titles of all five who were nominated instead of McKay, I think the only reason he could have been overlooked was ME AND ORSON WELLES did not play on enough screens.But McKay's work is not one of those great performances lost in a bad film.  ME AND ORSON WELLES has its moments, depicting the creative and personal chaos behind the scenes of the Orson Welles 1937 masterpiece play CAESAR, seemingly evidence of the memorable speech Welles wrote and gave years later in movie THE THIRD MAN:  ""In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.""To its credit,  while ME AND ORSON WELLES depicts CAESAR director Welles as egotistical and condescending it makes me understand why the cast and crew puts up with him.  We all have faults for which others forgive us.  I've worked with and for people even worse than the Welles we see in ME AND ORSON WELLES.  I just wish I'd had a boss or colleague with Welles's genius, as learning from someone like Orson Welles would make putting up with his garbage worthwhile.Christian McKay's standout work in ME AND ORSON WELLES does not mean you will overlook Leo Bill as Norman, James Tupper as Joe, Claire Danes as Sonja, and Zac Efron as Richard, to name four other fine performances. Speaking of Claire Danes, in homage to things left to the imagination of the 1930s era, a scene where she seduces a male colleague is much different than how the actress has her way with a boyfriend in SHOP GIRL.How much of a genius was Orson Welles?  In ME AND ORSON WELLES he nicknames Richard, age 17, ""Junior.""

Set in 1937, Richard wants to be an actor, and one afternoon cutting his school classes he stumbles upon Orson Welles' Mercury Theater as they`re trying to drum up some promotion for Welles' forthcoming modern dress play of Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar."" Richard convinces Welles (Christian McKay) of his ability to play a ukulele and Welles casts him in the play. Claire Danes plays Sonja Jones, the woman who none of the actors can obtain including, a randy Joseph Cotton (James Tupper), except, of course, for Welles, and Richard. The movie pivots on this love triangle.Christian McKay does well as Welles, several times he nails Welles exactly right, and his performance is the key one that holds together the plot. Efron does a good job as Richard, nothing spectacular but he holds his own with much more experienced actors.  James Tupper as Joseph Cotton acts as a guide for Richard through the Mercury theater and Welles and it's one of the more convincing roles in the movie. One of the problems is, some of the actors look to old to be the character they are portraying. The worst example is of Eddie Marsan playing John Houseman. Houseman was about 35 years old when the events in the movie take place, Marsan looks closer to 50.Directed by Richard Linklater (""Dazed and Confused"") it seemed the direction was listless, the movie at times drags and you wait for the next appearance of McKays' Welles to throw in some hubris or a grandiose speech to liven a scene up. I had a hard time writing this review because the movie didn't leave me with any lasting impressions either positively or negatively, surely that can't be good for a movie.If you`re looking for other movies on Orson Welles of that period ""The Cradle Will Rock"" is a more satisfying film covering almost the exact same time period in Welles' life or Vincent D'Onofrio's cameo as Welles in ""Ed Wood.""There were no bonus features.

A chance meeting with 22-year old Orson Welles (Christian McKay) results in a bit part in Welles' groundbreaking, modern-dress version of ""Julius Caesar"" soon to open on Broadway.  During a week of rehearsals at the Mercury Theatre, Richard is befriended by the cast and crew including Welles' assistant, Sonja (Claire Danes) while he tries to understand his flamboyant and temperamental boss.I think this movie was meant to bring Zac Efron out of teenage musicals and into more serious roles, but it doesn't succeed.  His character is bland and forgettable and he lacks charisma.  His Mr. Cool-speech and smirky mannerisms are so contemporary that he looks out of place in the thirties.

The acting was wonderful, as well as the production. However, what I found most fascinating about ME AND ORSON WELLS is what I learned afterwards about the man.Although I hadn't recognized the name, I didn't realize who Orson was until I looked him up on the Internet and found a picture of him at an older age. Christian McKay plays Orson with an amazing likeness in physical features as well as doing a spectacular job portraying him.In looking into his history, I discovered Orson Wells was originally from Kenosha Wisconsin and at a young age, moved to Chicago Illinois with his mother. Not far from where I live. His mother died when Orson was just eight years old, and when he was thirteen Orson's father passed away.Zac Efron does a wonderful job playing Richard Samuels, a young man who finds himself working alongside Orson Wells in a production of JULIUS CAESAR. He's warned by Sonja Jones, played by Claire Danes, that no one disagrees with the great Orson Wells. Despite the warning, he does just that and at the end of the production, is fired by Orson.ME AND ORSON WELLS was well acted, interesting and even paced, though I would have to say it was lacking in suspense, action and drama.",4,"INTERESTING AND WORTH WATCHING, JUST NOT GREAT",1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,1327,"['word', 'great', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'word', ""'d"", 'use', 'describe', 'movie', 'ME', 'AND', 'ORSON', 'WELLS', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'wonderful', 'as', 'well', 'production', 'However', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'fascinating', 'ME', 'AND', 'ORSON', 'WELLS', 'what', 'learned', 'afterwards', 'man.Although', 'had', ""n't"", 'recognized', 'name', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'who', 'Orson', 'was', 'looked', 'up', 'Internet', 'found', 'picture', 'older', 'age', 'Christian', 'McKay', 'Orson', 'amazing', 'likeness', 'physical', 'features', 'as', 'well', 'doing', 'spectacular', 'job', 'portraying', 'him.In', 'looking', 'history', 'discovered', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'was', 'originally', 'Kenosha', 'Wisconsin', 'young', 'age', 'moved', 'Chicago', 'Illinois', 'mother', 'Not', 'far', 'where', 'live', 'mother', 'died', 'when', 'Orson', 'was', 'just', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'was', 'thirteen', 'Orson', 'father', 'passed', 'away.Zac', 'Efron', 'wonderful', 'job', 'playing', 'Richard', 'Samuels', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'working', 'alongside', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'production', 'JULIUS', 'CAESAR', 'warned', 'Sonja', 'Jones', 'played', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'one', 'great', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'warning', 'just', 'end', 'production', 'fired', 'Orson.ME', 'AND', 'ORSON', 'WELLS', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'interesting', 'even', 'paced', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'lacking', 'suspense', 'action', 'drama']",N/A
176758,A3VLAZEPO9UJEA,1419897543,L. E. Cantrell,"[1, 3]","This is a film that on the whole I enjoyed.  Nevertheless, it must be described as an unhappy mix of the brilliant and the dreary.The flm's problem is obvous in its very title, ""Me and Orson Welles."" Frankly, I didn't give a d--n about the ""Me,"" while I was fascinated by the portrayal of the young, volcanic Orson Welles.  For some reason, 2009 was the year for screen viewing of larger-than-life icons through the experiences of nobodies; consider this film and the earlier ""Julie and Julia,"" or whatever it was called.Newcomer--at least on these shores--Christian McKay is simply brilliant in capturing the dazzling personality and unmitigated duplicity of Welles in his radio and Mercury Theatre days.Zac Efron is ... well, Zac Efron.Efron not very convincingly portrays a 17 year-old high school senior who stumbles on Welles and the Mercury Theatre in Manhattan in the final week of their preparations to present a modern-dress, fascist-styled version of Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar,"" renamed by Welles' edict as just plain ""Caesar.""  Efron fast talks himself into the job of an unpaid apprentice/bit player in the production.  Through his eyes we see the titanic, machiavellian, charming, treacherous Welles carry off a theatrical triumph against all odds and most standards of acceptable behavior.Alas, for far too much of its running time, the camera stays on Efron, his lame attempts to seduce one of the members of the company, and his crushing--not to mention inevitable--defeat in a contest of wills with Welles.This is a picture that will appeal to a relatively narrow audience: those people who love the theater and are interested in theatrical history.  The Welles and Mercury Theatre sequences will wow them, beyond a doubt.A presumably larger audience segment, those who might be interested in Zac Efron's boyish charms, such as they are, will probably be disappointed at their idol's inexplicalbe failure to triumph.As far as I'm concerned, this is a five-star film to the Welles and Mercury Theatre sequences and a three-star film for the Efron and girlfriend(s) sequences, for a composite rating of four stars.A NOTE ON FORMAL STRUCTURE:It should be noted that the film offers a meticulous parallelism between Welles and Efon's character.  Both Welles and the high schooler get along in showbiz by pure effrontary, both pull off an artistic triumph (""Caesar"" and the publication of a friend's short story in The New Yorker) by chicanery, both drop into extensive quotations from literary sources at unexpected moments and wow their listeners with them, both carry out successful campaigns of seductions, both clearly wonder at the end how they are ever going to top themselves--and so on.A PERSONAL NOTE:At the age of 17 while still in high school, I, too, discovered a theatrical company full of older, charismatic people.  And just like Efron's character, I joined it.  Unlike Efron's character, however, I was not so bloody stupid as to get on the wrong side of the director in my first week, nor did I attempt to seduce any member of the company ... well, not in my first week, anyway.LEC/Am/2-10",4,"In some ways a very, very good film",1265673600,"02 9, 2010",2010,3122,"['film', 'whole', 'enjoyed', 'Nevertheless', 'must', 'be', 'described', 'unhappy', 'mix', 'brilliant', 'dreary.The', 'flm', 'problem', 'obvous', 'very', 'title', 'Me', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'd', 'Me', 'was', 'fascinated', 'portrayal', 'young', 'volcanic', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'reason', '2009', 'was', 'year', 'screen', 'viewing', 'larger-than-life', 'icons', 'experiences', 'nobodies', 'consider', 'film', 'earlier', 'Julie', 'Julia', 'whatever', 'was', 'called.Newcomer', 'least', 'shores', 'Christian', 'McKay', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'capturing', 'dazzling', 'personality', 'unmitigated', 'duplicity', 'Welles', 'radio', 'Mercury', 'Theatre', 'days.Zac', 'Efron', 'well', 'Zac', 'Efron.Efron', 'not', 'very', 'convincingly', '17', 'year-old', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', 'Welles', 'Mercury', 'Theatre', 'Manhattan', 'final', 'week', 'preparations', 'present', 'modern-dress', 'fascist-styled', 'version', 'Shakespeare', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'renamed', 'Welles', 'edict', 'just', 'plain', 'Caesar', 'Efron', 'fast', 'talks', 'job', 'unpaid', 'apprentice/bit', 'player', 'production', 'eyes', 'see', 'titanic', 'machiavellian', 'charming', 'treacherous', 'Welles', 'carry', 'off', 'theatrical', 'triumph', 'odds', 'most', 'standards', 'acceptable', 'behavior.Alas', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'running', 'time', 'camera', 'Efron', 'lame', 'attempts', 'seduce', 'one', 'members', 'company', 'crushing', 'not', 'mention', 'inevitable', 'defeat', 'contest', 'wills', 'Welles.This', 'picture', 'will', 'appeal', 'relatively', 'narrow', 'audience', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'theater', 'are', 'interested', 'theatrical', 'history', 'Welles', 'Mercury', 'Theatre', 'sequences', 'will', 'wow', 'doubt.A', 'presumably', 'larger', 'audience', 'segment', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'boyish', 'charms', 'such', 'are', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'idol', 'inexplicalbe', 'failure', 'triumph.As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'five-star', 'film', 'Welles', 'Mercury', 'Theatre', 'sequences', 'three-star', 'film', 'Efron', 'girlfriend', 'sequences', 'composite', 'rating', 'four', 'stars.A', 'NOTE', 'ON', 'FORMAL', 'STRUCTURE', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'film', 'meticulous', 'parallelism', 'Welles', 'Efon', 'character', 'Welles', 'high', 'schooler', 'get', 'showbiz', 'pure', 'effrontary', 'pull', 'off', 'artistic', 'triumph', 'Caesar', 'publication', 'friend', 'short', 'story', 'New', 'Yorker', 'chicanery', 'drop', 'extensive', 'quotations', 'literary', 'sources', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'wow', 'listeners', 'carry', 'out', 'successful', 'campaigns', 'seductions', 'clearly', 'wonder', 'end', 'how', 'are', 'ever', 'going', 'top', 'so', 'on.A', 'PERSONAL', 'NOTE', 'age', '17', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'too', 'discovered', 'theatrical', 'company', 'full', 'older', 'charismatic', 'people', 'just', 'Efron', 'character', 'joined', 'Efron', 'character', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'bloody', 'stupid', 'get', 'wrong', 'side', 'director', 'first', 'week', 'did', 'attempt', 'seduce', 'member', 'company', 'well', 'not', 'first', 'week', 'anyway.LEC/Am/2-10']",N/A

While director Richard Linklater has done better and this may not go down as one of his best efforts, there are a number of very good qualities about this film. For example, the acting is rather good; the plot moves along well and the casting was done with great forethought. Christian McKay turns in a superlative performance as a young, nutty, artistic, impossible-to-please and yet sometimes very humane Orson Welles, who is putting on ""Caesar"" at The Mercury Theater on Broadway in New York City. Claire Danes also scores high marks in my book for playing Sonja Jones, a young theater manager and aspiring actress who's willing to do anything to further her career in acting; and Zac Efron does well in his role as the young, nave Richard Samuels who talks his way into Welles' play when Welles needs an extra actor. Zo Kazan also does a great job as the down-to earth young aspiring writer Gretta Adler. The script was well written and the choreography and cinematography shine. The editing, however, could have been a little tighter; there are a few minutes here and there that could have been cut to make the plot more interesting still.When the action begins, we quickly meet young high school student Richard Samuels (Zac Efron) who talks his way into a play being put on by a young Orson Welles (Christian McKay) at Broadway's Mercury Theater. Richard, who is too young to be fully aware of the harsh realities of life and show business, falls fast for the ""ice queen"" Sonja (Claire Danes) who pays romantic attention to Richard while the other young men in the production remain rather frustrated by her refusal to go out with them. At the same time, Orson is quite demanding, rude and even brutal at times with his theater troupe as he prepares them for the opening night of ""Caesar."" Welles runs around all the time threatening to hire anyone who steps one inch out of line and he never hesitates to fire anyone who dares to have an honest disagreement with him. Ouch! As the movie progresses, we see how the play becomes more and more of a reality while the relationship between Richard and Sonja develops; this is a good way to depict a coming-of-age story with young Richard learning the hard way that life is far from fair.While Zac Efron has outstanding moments on the screen, especially in his scenes with Claire Danes, he was cast yet again as a seventeen year old while in real life he's twenty-two; it works but this was not the best vehicle for Zac Efron to begin breaking away from the High School Musical spotlight.Of course, as I am writing this there is only the theatrical release of this picture. I hope that any DVD or Blu-ray release of this film will have some nice bonus features.Overall, Me and Orson Welles is a high average film. While I could be wrong, I'm not expecting this film to receive the Oscar for Best Picture this coming March.

First, there is the spot-on depiction of Welles by a never-heard-of-him actor named Christian McKay.  Watching him as the young director/actor, it is easy to see him in his most famous production ""Citizen Kane"".  I remember Welles pretty well back in the `60's when he would show up on the late night shows.  McKay has pinned down every characteristic.  The film centers around a young high school kid named Richard (Zac Efron) who lucks his way into a part in Welles new production of Shakespeare's ""Caesar"" but in a modern format.  Kind of a precursor to what Baz Luhrmann did with ""Romeo + Juliet"".  There's a minor side-story involving Richard and Welles' secretary Sonja (Claire Danes), but the other reason to watch the film is the believable back stage story of putting on a play in New York in 1937.

(AFI # 1, 100 All Time Best movies - see it if you haven't).Wells and the Mercury Theater company are legendary. Before Citizen Kane, before the Third Man, Welles gathered a bunch of unknowns who would later become some of the best actors and teachers acting has ever known. They worked for nothing, on a showstring, hoping to get noticed. ""Me"" of the title is Richard, played by Zac Efron. He is slick and a bit shallow but ultimately well chosen for the part he plays. Orson Welles, played by Christian McKay, is brilliant, and overbearing. He is portrayed as a cheerful, cunning, major nasty ahole, who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. McKay as Wells is as brilliant in this part as the man he is portraying. Richard, a high school kid, gets a job in the stage production of Julius Caesar because Wells has just fired the last actor and because Richard claims to play the ukulele. He can't, but he learns to fast to keep his part. His ""big break"", Richard's love interest is the supposedly frigid Sonja, (Claire Danes).As I watched there is ""John"" and ""Joe"" in the drama. I watched for a while before I realize ""John"" is John Houseman (played here by Eddie Marsan). Houseman is perhaps the greatest acting teacher in history. (Houseman played the professor in the law student TV show, ""The Paper Chase""). The ""Joe"" turns out to be Joseph Cotton (by James Tupper), the star (with Wells) of many famous Wells movies, ""Kane"", ""The Third Man"", ""The Magnificent Ambersons"", etc. The entrance of Harry Lime in ""The Third Man"", a face  in a totally darkened doorway, is one of the greatest entrances in film history (The real Orson Wells thought so...) . In ""Me and Orson"" the Joe Cotton reprises this scene.Orson Welles is the center of gravity in this fragile universe. He is a totally self-centered ego-maniac, clever enough to manipulate the other actors he has assembled. He fends off creditors and cajoles investors. Welles calls Richard ""Junior"" all throughout and it is unclear, through much of the movie, if he really knows his name. The central figure is Welles who diddles with actors (telling each what they want to hear), the script and even when the opening night will be up until the last. The Welles character in ""Me & Orson"" is very much taken from the character Charles Foster Kane (William Randolph Hearst) in the afore mentioned ""Citizen Kane"". This movie is full of insider jokes and references. From what I know of the Mercury Theater, this is more or less what the environment was like, before it's players became famous on radio/stage/movies.This is a small low budget movie. It's not ""Citizen Kane"" but this drama/comedy has many references to it.

176766,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,1419897543,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 6]","Based on the novel by Robert Kaplow, ""Me and Orson Welles"" takes place in 1937, just as the theatrical and radio wunderkind is mounting a bold new stage production of ""Julius Caesar"" - set in modern times - with his recently formed troupe, the Mercury Theater Players. Richard Samuels (Zak Efron) is a cocky, 17-year-old aspiring actor who charms his way into the company and Welles' good graces - to the extent that such a thing is possible, that is. A serious conflict develops between them, however, when the boy, inexperienced in the ways of love and how the world really works, crosses swords with Welles by foolishly losing his heart to Sonja Jones (Claire Danes), a production assistant who takes the lad to her bed, but who's also not above sleeping her way to the top, even with the maestro himself (David O. Selznick is her next intended target).As a work of historical fiction, ""Me and Orson Welles,"" written by Holly Gent Palmo and Vince Palmo and directed by Richard Linklater, is less intriguing for the story it tells than for its behind-the-scenes glimpse into the theatrical world of 1930s New York and for the way in which it captures the pulse of its era (even though the interiors were largely filmed in England). The real joy of the film lies in the performance by Christian McKay, who, as Welles, perfectly nails the look and sound of the pop culture legend without once resorting to mimicry or caricature in his effort to do so. Through McKay's work, we get to see Welles for the eccentric and multi-faceted genius (and all-around pain-in-the-ass) he really was - a natural-born entertainer, a smooth-talking ladies man, a raging megalomaniac, and an unforgiving taskmaster, who, through a canny combination of hard work and good, old-fashioned showmanship, turned himself into a household name. Yet, McKay also portrays Welles as a man whose shrewd awareness of his own pomposity played a key role in carefully crafting that larger-than-life image that would become such an essential part of his public persona. Yet, Welles could also be a devoted mentor to those he felt had potential and talent, ""God-created actors,"" as he called them - at least up to the point where he felt one had contradicted or betrayed him, and then all hell could break loose, as Richard, much to his everlasting regret, eventually learns.An impressive supporting cast, a witty script and fine period detail also contribute to the fun of the piece, but it is the amazing Christian McKay who makes ""Me and Orson Welles"" a must-see event.",4,McKay nails his part perfectly,1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,2537,"['Based', 'novel', 'Robert', 'Kaplow', 'Me', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'place', '1937', 'just', 'theatrical', 'radio', 'wunderkind', 'mounting', 'bold', 'new', 'stage', 'production', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'set', 'modern', 'times', 'recently', 'formed', 'troupe', 'Mercury', 'Theater', 'Players', 'Richard', 'Samuels', 'Zak', 'Efron', 'cocky', '17-year-old', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'who', 'way', 'company', 'Welles', 'good', 'graces', 'extent', 'thing', 'possible', 'serious', 'conflict', 'however', 'when', 'boy', 'inexperienced', 'ways', 'love', 'how', 'world', 'really', 'swords', 'Welles', 'foolishly', 'losing', 'heart', 'Sonja', 'Jones', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'production', 'assistant', 'who', 'lad', 'bed', 'who', 'also', 'not', 'sleeping', 'way', 'top', 'even', 'maestro', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'next', 'intended', 'target', 'work', 'historical', 'fiction', 'Me', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'written', 'Holly', 'Gent', 'Palmo', 'Vince', 'Palmo', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'less', 'intriguing', 'story', 'behind-the-scenes', 'glimpse', 'theatrical', 'world', '1930s', 'New', 'York', 'way', 'pulse', 'era', 'even', 'interiors', 'were', 'largely', 'filmed', 'England', 'real', 'joy', 'film', 'performance', 'Christian', 'McKay', 'who', 'Welles', 'perfectly', 'look', 'sound', 'pop', 'culture', 'legend', 'once', 'resorting', 'mimicry', 'caricature', 'effort', 'do', 'so', 'McKay', 'work', 'get', 'see', 'Welles', 'eccentric', 'multi-faceted', 'genius', 'all-around', 'pain-in-the-ass', 'really', 'was', 'natural-born', 'entertainer', 'smooth-talking', 'ladies', 'man', 'raging', 'megalomaniac', 'unforgiving', 'taskmaster', 'who', 'canny', 'combination', 'hard', 'work', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'showmanship', 'turned', 'household', 'name', 'McKay', 'also', 'Welles', 'man', 'shrewd', 'awareness', 'own', 'pomposity', 'played', 'key', 'role', 'carefully', 'crafting', 'larger-than-life', 'image', 'would', 'become', 'such', 'essential', 'part', 'public', 'persona', 'Welles', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'devoted', 'mentor', 'felt', 'had', 'potential', 'talent', 'God-created', 'actors', 'called', 'least', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'felt', 'one', 'had', 'contradicted', 'betrayed', 'then', 'hell', 'could', 'break', 'loose', 'Richard', 'much', 'everlasting', 'regret', 'eventually', 'learns.An', 'impressive', 'supporting', 'cast', 'witty', 'script', 'fine', 'period', 'detail', 'also', 'fun', 'piece', 'amazing', 'Christian', 'McKay', 'who', 'Me', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'must-see', 'event']",N/A

This film shows the protean genius making the transition from radio to the daunting discipline of a stage production.  It's fun to accompany him into the radio studio where he goes on air, coast to coast, absolutely cold and without having even glanced at the script AND walks away with the show.  He brings the same cocky confidence in ""winging it"" to his giant gamble with the radical stage production of Julius Caesar and it all succeeds powerfully, flambouyantly and with plenty of shock value --- all to become trademarks of his meteoric career.  Inside the theater (empty for rehearsals) we watch the gamble unfold.Zac Efron (17 in the film) lands a bit part in the play almost by accident and is stunned to find himself in the daily company of Welles, Joseph Cotton and the entire cast of the soon-to-be-famous Mercury Theatre.  Although Welles and the chaotic rehearsals are the jawdropping thread of the movie, it's not all ""theater"" and it's a charming, accomplished Zac Efron who preserves the film's smooth continuity as he moves between various worlds, cutting high school classes, having his first taste of seduction and then erring by challenging Welles once too often and paying the price.  It's all great fun and it's an added treat to see the dead ringers they found to play Welles and Joseph Cotton on screen.  The entire cast enters into the zesty spirit of the rehearsals, with their vanities, clashes with Welles and their forebodings of disaster regarding opening night.  It hits a balance and a ""buzz"" that's most pleasant and agreeable.Historical hawkeyes will notice that no one was dressed shabbily with the clothes patches that were commonplace during the Great Depression, but this was done with a sure feel to preserve the feel good factor and in this latter the film succeeds abundantly.  It was a treat to watch it three times, savouring the blaze of Welles's genius and the open ended optimism of being young --- even during the grim times of the Great Depression. The film is beautifully  crafted, bouyant, original and a sure recipe FOR FUN & DELIGHT!",5,A Feel Good movie with lots of bounce and verve.

176768,A387BD735MI50R,1419897543,R. Schultz,"[2, 2]","Actor Christian McKay channels Orson Welles in this film. It isn't that he does an imitation of Welles, Rich Little-like. He naturally becomes Welles, at least the Welles we knew from the great man's many later talk-show appearances and from biographies of him. But this is an earlier slice of his career. Here we see Welles' efforts to mount a production of Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"" in modern-dress for his Mercury Theater.Instead of being costumed in era-appropriate Roman togas, Welles appointed the actors to come on stage dressed as Fascists and gangsters. People still talk about the brilliance of that late 1930's production. Perhaps it was brilliant. But this movie doesn't really give us a sense of what made the production such a triumph of Welles' artistic vision. Nor does it give us a clear idea of why Welles got anointed with the adjective ""genius,"" or why he won such cult-like devotion from the people who worked for him. This is a good and engaging movie, but it somehow remains limited, as if it was a framed sepia photograph of some 1930's college class.McKay's sheer Wellesianness is the best thing about the movie. The movie's story is told from the point of view of a young man who, on another of Welles' whims, is granted a speaking part in the production. That young man remains rather staged and colorless. It's difficult to care what happens to him.The main thing that's memorable about this movie is its depiction of Welles' almost sociopathic cruelty. Some of his manipulations could be set down to his dedication to his art. He does whatever he has to do to enable the show ""to go on."" But as shown here, Welles' human failings were more profound, less justifiable. So the movie leaves the viewer with a bad taste in the mouth. It leaves one in a depressing state of disillusionment. That disillusionment tends to reflect on all of Welles' future productions. Was Citizen Kane really as good as everyone has declared it to be? Could such excellence come from such a self-absorbed, ruthless actor/impresario? Could anything good come of such blunt indifference to the feelings of real humans as opposed to scripted humans?If you're prepared to be let down about the man and his motives though, this is still a worthwhile movie. However, the DVD contains a second disappointment. At least the edition I got had no commentaries on it, and if ever a film cried out for commentary - this one did. I longed to hear from people who might have worked for Welles, either in his Mercury Theater days, or later. It seemed essential to follow up this movie with a chaser of chit-chat about the good, the bad, and the ugly of the real Orson Welles.",4,Raising Kane,1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,2670,"['Actor', 'Christian', 'McKay', 'channels', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'film', ""n't"", 'imitation', 'Welles', 'Rich', 'Little-like', 'naturally', 'Welles', 'least', 'Welles', 'knew', 'great', 'man', 'many', 'later', 'talk-show', 'appearances', 'biographies', 'earlier', 'slice', 'career', 'Here', 'see', 'Welles', 'efforts', 'mount', 'production', 'Shakespeare', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'modern-dress', 'Mercury', 'Theater.Instead', 'being', 'costumed', 'era-appropriate', 'Roman', 'togas', 'Welles', 'appointed', 'actors', 'come', 'stage', 'dressed', 'Fascists', 'gangsters', 'People', 'still', 'talk', 'brilliance', 'late', '1930', 'production', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'brilliant', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'sense', 'what', 'made', 'production', 'triumph', 'Welles', 'artistic', 'vision', 'give', 'clear', 'idea', 'why', 'Welles', 'got', 'anointed', 'adjective', 'genius', 'why', 'won', 'such', 'cult-like', 'devotion', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'good', 'engaging', 'movie', 'somehow', 'limited', 'was', 'framed', 'sepia', 'photograph', '1930', 'college', 'class.McKay', 'sheer', 'Wellesianness', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'movie', 'story', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Welles', 'whims', 'granted', 'speaking', 'part', 'production', 'young', 'man', 'rather', 'staged', 'colorless', 'difficult', 'care', 'what', 'him.The', 'main', 'thing', 'memorable', 'movie', 'depiction', 'Welles', 'almost', 'sociopathic', 'cruelty', 'manipulations', 'could', 'be', 'set', 'down', 'dedication', 'art', 'whatever', 'do', 'enable', 'show', 'go', 'shown', 'here', 'Welles', 'human', 'failings', 'were', 'more', 'profound', 'less', 'justifiable', 'movie', 'viewer', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'one', 'depressing', 'state', 'disillusionment', 'disillusionment', 'reflect', 'Welles', 'future', 'productions', 'Was', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'really', 'as', 'good', 'everyone', 'declared', 'be', 'Could', 'such', 'excellence', 'come', 'such', 'self-absorbed', 'ruthless', 'actor/impresario', 'Could', 'anything', 'good', 'come', 'such', 'blunt', 'indifference', 'feelings', 'real', 'humans', 'opposed', 'scripted', 'humans', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'man', 'motives', 'though', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'However', 'DVD', 'second', 'disappointment', 'least', 'edition', 'got', 'had', 'commentaries', 'ever', 'film', 'cried', 'out', 'commentary', 'one', 'did', 'longed', 'hear', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'Welles', 'either', 'Mercury', 'Theater', 'days', 'later', 'seemed', 'essential', 'follow', 'up', 'movie', 'chaser', 'chit-chat', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'real', 'Orson', 'Welles']",N/A
176769,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,1419897543,Turfseer,"[2, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***It's 1937 and the young Orson Welles is beginning to make a name for himself in both radio and the theater. His Mercury theater is putting on Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar' and 18 year old Richard Samuels (Zac Efron) manages to get a bit part as Lucius in Welles' new fangled production in modern dress.There isn't much to the plot of 'Me and Orson Welles'. Richard falls for Sonja Jones (Claire Danes), Orson's production assistant who has no guilt in sleeping her way to the top. She ultimately achieves her goal in getting a date with David O. Selznick, the famous Hollywood producer who two years later will produce 'Gone With the Wind'. But along the way, she has a momentary fling with Richard who naively believes that their relationship might turn into something. After Richard realizes that Orson is bedding Sonja, he takes Joseph Cotton's advice to ""fight for her"" and ends up getting on Orson's bad side by accusing him of being an adulterer. Orson, the egomaniac that he is, will not tolerate any dissent from any members of his cast, let alone a neophyte 18 year old, and promptly fires Richard. But since opening night is right on the horizon, Orson has to momentarily eat crow and flatter Richard so he'll return to the show. Once opening night has come and gone, Richard learns that Orson has dispensed with him for good. Richard decides that perhaps he was never meant to be an actor and exits gracefully with a young woman who he had met earlier, an aspiring writer who he had helped get published through the assistance and good graces of ex-lover Sonja.What makes 'Me and Orson Welles' so enjoyable is Christian McKay's performance as the narcissistic thespian. McKay is in his late 30s and looks more like the Orson Welles of the mid to late 40s than the young wunderkind of 1937. Nonetheless, if you can overlook the age discrepancy, you'll be amazed at just how believable McKay is at portraying Welles when he was just starting out.McKay pulls out all the stops, showing us what a 'character' Orson Welles was. He was a man who was bursting with creative ideas, always experimenting until he got things right. But the path to perfection was fraught with miscues and the scenes of all the flubbed rehearsals are quite amusing. McKay is brilliant especially when he shows Welles manipulating his actors so that they will bend to his will. It's made clear from the beginning, Welles always had to be in control. But occasionally, if you did oppose him, he would be flexible enough to consider contrary ideas (he's willing to incorporate suggestions that he initially rejects from Norman Lloyd who plays Cinna the Poet in Julius Caesar).McKay also does a great job in showing what a great actor Welles was. Particularly impressive is the scene in which McKay has Welles 'improvising' during the radio broadcast. And don't forget how McKay/Welles handles Shakespeare in the final scenes where 'Julius Caesar' is finally put on; the tremendous raves from the audience are wholly justified. Screenwriter Holly Gent Palmo must be complimented on presenting the many nuances of Welles' larger-than-life character. I loved how the 'sprinkler incident' is foreshadowed by Welles' gut conviction that an earlier calamity can somehow prevent the occurrence of a later and more devastating catastrophe.While it's admirable that Zac Efron chose to advance his career by getting involved in a more sophisticated production such as 'Me and Orson Welles' (as opposed to earlier 'low-brow' efforts such as '17 Again' or 'High School Musical'), he doesn't quite have the experience to be totally convincing as the nave and impressionable Richard. Equally forgettable is Claire Danes who is saddled with the non-descript part of the social-climbing Sonja. Much more to my liking is Ben Chaplin as George Coulouris playing Mark Antony. Chaplin obviously is a classically trained actor who shows his range as both tragedian and comedian (he's great as Antony on stage but also as Coulouris who has stage fright before tackling the part).'Me and Orson Welles' is basically a showcase for Christian McKay who has had experience in playing Orson Welles before in a one-man show.
