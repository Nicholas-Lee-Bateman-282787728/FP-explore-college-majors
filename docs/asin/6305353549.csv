It is a well written script, hilarious, though in a very, very dark way. I love the title, so simply understated that it adds to the humor. It's a well thought out, well shot film. And there are some phenomenal performances by Jon Favreau (always a pleasure to watch), Cameron Diaz (who I've never seen do poorly), Leland Orser (in such an understated role), Jeremy Piven, Jeanne Tripplehorn, and the always panicky, Daniel Stern--who does guilt so well. And the star performance is by Christian Slater, who plays his role so well it is a flashback to his heyday when he was getting good roles like this. And for those who bother to dig, there is an extra surprise to add to the humor, Berg cast porn star Kobe Tai as the hooker. This was a well done movie if not a well done dvd. There are no extra features on it. No featurettes or making of. No commentary, though the film seems to beg for one.

460900,A1LO05OQR2UAG2,6305353549,"""baronnine""","[15, 25]","I can't believe I'm writing this, but this film is excellent.  After all of the tarring and feathering it's suffered at the hands of reviews here, I watched it anyway on a lark, when in the mood for B-grade movie badness.  Suffice it to say that I was extremely, pleasantly surprised...this is an  excellent film.  The cinematography, plot, screenplay, and acting are all  so uniformly excellent that I ended up with newfound respect for almost  every player that had a hand in it.  I think I know what the problem is  behind the wildly opposing viewpoints on the movie: its idiotic marketing.  It is assuredly NOT a comedy, especially not on the order of comedies like  There's Something About Mary.  It's a disturbing film, with some brilliant  insights and statements on human nature, and yes, it does have some funny  scenes, but the humor is generally somewhat nervous.  In any case, I am now  shocked (and pleasantly surprised) to find that Very Bad Things is one of  my favorite films.  I think Peter Berg is very talented; it would be  travesty if he didn't get another chance behind a camera (and screenplay),  and I have newfound admiration for Christian Slater, who not only relishes  his part, but all but steals the movie.  It's unfortunate that some are  raking this movie through several layers of mud; I believe there are two  problems with this.  Firstly, they are letting personal discomfort at the  subject matter get in the way of an impartial review...even if they didn't  enjoy it, they should be able to concede the film's obvious technical and  performance strengths at the least.  And secondly, I think that, quite  plainly and frankly, if you're really THAT disturbed by this movie that it  could, for example, ruin your night, your sensibilities really are too low.  If you can deal with a sometimes-uncomfortably naked look at the ugliness  of human nature, and yes, have a nervous laugh or two all the while, then  you'll likely enjoy this film as much as I did.",5,Wonderful!,948585600,"01 23, 2000",2000,1991,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'writing', 'film', 'excellent', 'tarring', 'feathering', 'suffered', 'hands', 'reviews', 'here', 'watched', 'anyway', 'lark', 'when', 'mood', 'B-grade', 'movie', 'badness', 'Suffice', 'say', 'was', 'extremely', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'excellent', 'film', 'cinematography', 'plot', 'screenplay', 'acting', 'are', 'so', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'ended', 'up', 'newfound', 'respect', 'almost', 'player', 'had', 'hand', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'problem', 'wildly', 'opposing', 'viewpoints', 'movie', 'idiotic', 'marketing', 'assuredly', 'NOT', 'comedy', 'especially', 'not', 'order', 'comedies', 'Something', 'Mary', 'disturbing', 'film', 'brilliant', 'insights', 'statements', 'human', 'nature', 'yes', 'have', 'funny', 'scenes', 'humor', 'generally', 'somewhat', 'nervous', 'case', 'am', 'now', 'shocked', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'think', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'very', 'talented', 'would', 'be', 'travesty', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'camera', 'screenplay', 'have', 'newfound', 'admiration', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'unfortunate', 'are', 'raking', 'movie', 'several', 'layers', 'mud', 'believe', 'are', 'two', 'problems', 'Firstly', 'are', 'letting', 'personal', 'discomfort', 'subject', 'matter', 'get', 'way', 'impartial', 'review', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'concede', 'film', 'obvious', 'technical', 'performance', 'strengths', 'least', 'secondly', 'think', 'quite', 'plainly', 'frankly', ""'re"", 'really', 'THAT', 'disturbed', 'movie', 'could', 'example', 'ruin', 'night', 'sensibilities', 'really', 'are', 'too', 'low', 'can', 'deal', 'sometimes-uncomfortably', 'naked', 'look', 'ugliness', 'human', 'nature', 'yes', 'have', 'nervous', 'laugh', 'two', 'while', 'then', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'enjoy', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'did']",Very Bad Things

The men are more concerned covering their tracks and not getting caught then they are feeling emotion over killing people.Besides the twisted sense of humor, you can also expect lots and lots of arguing involving the group of men.  They constantly argue over who was to blame for the murders, and build up a swear storm trying to calm each other down.  It's funny because they keep picking public places where people can hear them to argue.I honestly don't know what to think about a movie like this.  On one hand it's funny so the movie is worth watching, but then again, it's never funny to make fun of people dying in tragic ways (and the ending of the movie is almost sickening).Furthermore the pacing and the writing of the storyline could have definitely been better.

Youssef ""surfur""","[2, 3]","by Dane YoussefWell, now here's one that feels like doesn't just feel like another machine-made piece from off the assembly line. Here is a movie that feels like it has it's own ideas, thoughts, edges and all.The studio execuives didn't dig their claws into this one, sucking all the nerve and originality out of it just to make it inoffensive and more filt for mass consumption.All the more making this a move that's really worth seeing for those who don't like movies that just connect-the-dots and paint-by-numbers. In other words, a movie that desperately needs to exist. And be seen.A bizzare combo protein-shake of black comedy, thriller and horror show, this is one of those Slow Saturday Night cult films that the weirdo clerk behind the counter is always personally recommending for those customers who ae kind of like his pals.""Very Bad Things"" is a film that plays out like a worse-case scenerio. One of those movies that puts a group of relative people in a situation where everything that can possibly go wrong... does. Hopefully, with results that translate to a good movie.I found the movie to work on multiple levels. As an angry, aggressive, and assertive male-bonding comedy. As a thriller. As a white-knuckle, nail-biting action film. As a nightmare.Writer/Director Peter Berg remarks he came up with the idea for this movie when he was at a bachelor party and saw the rowdy and over-the-top behavior from a lot of the other guests. These guys were looking for trouble, he said. What would happen if they found it? More than they could handle.The movie is all-over-the-map, but I like that about it. Berg sets up some cynical suburbanites and their rowdy behavior and puts them in several life-or-death situations, which despite what many say, is thrilling to watch.Christian Slater gives the strongest performance as the devil-may-care Robert Boyd, a man who seems to have no moral threshold. We never doubt his actions for a second. Slater knows how to play this character as plays him to the hilt.Daniel Stern plays his usual nebbish. From the ""City Slickers"" movies, the ""Home Alone"" movies and all his others, he's appropriately nervous and uneasy--especially after what's occurring right now. There's are massive murders bobbing up and the body count is still rising.Cameron Diaz is also effective doing an evil turn on the wedding-obsessed loon she was in ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" as a woman who doesn't care about anything else but having her big day. As far as she's concerned, the guests and the groom are secondary. She nitpicks and she bullies and berates. Many guys see this as the epitome of the woman who's about to have her big day.Jon Faverau isn't as ""money"" as he's been in other roles, but maybe that's because he's supposed to be the straight man. He's a little too straight. Too stiff. You kind of wish they had spiced him up some more. He appears to just be in shock and going along with the flow most of the time, like a tag-along.The movie plays out as a dark comedic thriller and at times a morality tale. What I like the most is the anarchy of the film and the performance of Christian Slater and especially the different ways the men and women in the movie react to him.Watch for his scene with Tripplehorn when they go one-on-one. The homages to ""Good Fellas"" and ""Reservior Dogs"" are cute and memorable too.Like I said before, this is a must-see for anyone who hates generic, paint-by-numbers movies. If this sounds like your cup of tea (and it damn well should), you're someone after my own heart. Then THIS is a must-see.Next time you're at the video store looking for a movie with huevos that hit hard (but don't worry, not down there exactly)...danessf@yahoo.com[...][...]",3,"A wild, thrilling savory (acquired) taste",1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,3727,"['Dane', 'YoussefWell', 'now', 'here', 'one', ""n't"", 'just', 'feel', 'machine-made', 'piece', 'assembly', 'line', 'Here', 'movie', 'own', 'ideas', 'thoughts', 'edges', 'all.The', 'studio', 'execuives', 'did', ""n't"", 'dig', 'claws', 'one', 'sucking', 'nerve', 'originality', 'just', 'make', 'inoffensive', 'more', 'filt', 'mass', 'consumption.All', 'more', 'making', 'move', 'really', 'worth', 'seeing', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'just', 'connect-the-dots', 'paint-by-numbers', 'other', 'words', 'movie', 'desperately', 'exist', 'be', 'seen.A', 'bizzare', 'combo', 'protein-shake', 'black', 'comedy', 'thriller', 'horror', 'show', 'one', 'Slow', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'cult', 'films', 'weirdo', 'clerk', 'counter', 'always', 'personally', 'recommending', 'customers', 'who', 'ae', 'kind', 'pals', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'film', 'out', 'worse-case', 'scenerio', 'One', 'movies', 'group', 'relative', 'people', 'situation', 'where', 'everything', 'can', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'Hopefully', 'results', 'translate', 'good', 'movie.I', 'found', 'movie', 'work', 'multiple', 'levels', 'angry', 'aggressive', 'assertive', 'male-bonding', 'comedy', 'thriller', 'white-knuckle', 'nail-biting', 'action', 'film', 'nightmare.Writer/Director', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'remarks', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'bachelor', 'party', 'saw', 'rowdy', 'over-the-top', 'behavior', 'lot', 'other', 'guests', 'guys', 'were', 'looking', 'trouble', 'said', 'What', 'would', 'happen', 'found', 'More', 'could', 'handle.The', 'movie', 'all-over-the-map', 'like', 'Berg', 'up', 'cynical', 'suburbanites', 'rowdy', 'behavior', 'several', 'life-or-death', 'situations', 'what', 'many', 'say', 'thrilling', 'watch.Christian', 'Slater', 'strongest', 'performance', 'devil-may-care', 'Robert', 'Boyd', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'moral', 'threshold', 'never', 'doubt', 'actions', 'second', 'Slater', 'how', 'play', 'character', 'plays', 'hilt.Daniel', 'Stern', 'usual', 'nebbish', 'City', 'Slickers', 'movies', 'Home', 'Alone', 'movies', 'others', 'appropriately', 'nervous', 'uneasy', 'especially', 'what', 'occurring', 'right', 'now', 'are', 'massive', 'murders', 'bobbing', 'up', 'body', 'count', 'still', 'rising.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'also', 'effective', 'doing', 'evil', 'turn', 'wedding-obsessed', 'loon', 'was', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'anything', 'else', 'having', 'big', 'day', 'As', 'far', 'concerned', 'guests', 'groom', 'are', 'secondary', 'nitpicks', 'bullies', 'berates', 'Many', 'guys', 'see', 'epitome', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'big', 'day.Jon', 'Faverau', ""n't"", 'money', 'been', 'other', 'roles', 'maybe', 'supposed', 'be', 'straight', 'man', 'little', 'too', 'straight', 'Too', 'stiff', 'kind', 'wish', 'had', 'spiced', 'up', 'more', 'just', 'be', 'shock', 'going', 'along', 'flow', 'most', 'time', 'tag-along.The', 'movie', 'out', 'dark', 'comedic', 'thriller', 'times', 'morality', 'tale', 'What', 'like', 'most', 'anarchy', 'film', 'performance', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'especially', 'different', 'ways', 'men', 'women', 'movie', 'react', 'him.Watch', 'scene', 'Tripplehorn', 'when', 'go', 'one-on-one', 'homages', 'Good', 'Fellas', 'Reservior', 'Dogs', 'are', 'cute', 'memorable', 'too.Like', 'said', 'before', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'who', 'generic', 'paint-by-numbers', 'movies', 'cup', 'tea', 'damn', 'well', 'should', ""'re"", 'someone', 'own', 'heart', 'Then', 'THIS', 'must-see.Next', 'time', ""'re"", 'video', 'store', 'looking', 'movie', 'huevos', 'hit', 'hard', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'not', 'there', 'exactly', 'danessf', '@', 'yahoo.com', '[', ']', '[', ']']",Very Bad Things

I was actually surfing the net, the tv had been left on, and this is what came on next.  I found myself continuing to look up at the movie and the next thing I knew, I had moved to the sofa and watched the entire thing.  Having never heard of the movie before, I didn't even realize it was a comedy til about a half hour in.  Everything goes so horribly wrong and you can see how the two slightly normal, decent guys get swept up into the cover-up that continues to blow up in their faces.  I gasped out loud more times than I could count, and then cracked up.  Every couple of years, I dust it off and watch it again and it gets funnier each time.  There are at least 10 classic lines in this movie, from Cameron Diaz ""I will not be common"" to Christian Slater ""I am the Lighthouse"" and my favorite ""I want to hear the truth, and I don't want to hear it from the LIAR""  When they are all leaning on the bathroom door, each characters face and behavior is priceless.  We all know people who embody each of the personalities of these characters.  The eager to please but still immature groom, the somewhat shallow, wedding obsessed bride-zilla, the hard working, serious minded suburban dad, his screw up brother, and the party boy, lying, jerk friend of our hubby that will never grow up that we can't stand and wish would just go away.  Also, the drunk/drugged up friends who are so deep, brilliant, cerebral and worst of all, sentimental when they are gorked out.I know Hangover was the breakout comedy of the year, and it was funny, but I have to say I watched this again last night and laughed til I teared up.  I can't explain it.  It is horrible really, VERY BAD THINGS they did, but there is true cosmic justice, and after all, it is just a movie, for entertainment, not some movie to learn any morals from.

It has an overriding smugness and self satisfaction (very typical of the 1990s') that overtakes any comedic elements in it.  The hysterical performances (especially Daniel Stern) end up being unintentionally hilarious, because they are so ridiculously over the top, and I don't think that was the point.  It was like Peter Berg went out to make a really vile, disgusting film, without any taste, substance, class, or intelligence.  Berg did an interview where he said ""yeah, throw things at the screen.  I know it's horrible.""  It reminds me of when Jerry Springer used to say ""I know my show is trash"", thinking that excuses him for making it.  It doesn't.  Trash is trash, even if you know you're making it.

460923,AIO247KHD2O40,6305353549,James N Simpson,"[1, 2]","Had never heard of this movie but found it in a national $2 store chain.  I occasionally pick up these that have interesting covers or with big name stars made before they found fame (or lost it as in Slater's case), as they are cheaper than renting a movie.  Usually they are forgettable and you can see why they never made it, but sometimes, as with this great movie, they have just slipped through the cracks somehow.Basic plot of Very Bad Things revolves around a group of friends who go to Vegas in the days just before a wedding for the bachelor's party.  A drunken mistake ends up with a dead body and I Know What You Did Last Summer style you've got the debate to call the police or dispose of the body and move on with their lives.  While we don't have a fisherman with a hook we have enormous guilt building in some of those who were there, and paranoia that they'll talk to wives or the police by the others.  Throw in Cameron Diaz brilliantly playing the bride from hell who wants a perfect wedding and the tension just gets greater.  Of course she would later make the big time with a little movie also filmed the same year as this (1998) called Something About Mary.Jon Farveau is the actor playing the groom to be and you'll be watching going, I know him from something, but I don't think he looks like that anymore.  Add on a fair bit of weight, loose most of the hair and add a goatee for some recent stuff and you'll work it out.  So this cheap to buy movie has got that discussion point while watching it factor as well.  Slater plays a brilliant character, if his personal life going off the tracks hadn't sidetracked him out of the big budget films who knows what this 80s early 90s star would have achieved, but it does bring into this nice little film.  Throw in an older Daniel Stern famous for his earlier in the 90s decade work as a simpleton criminal in the Home Alone movies, and sidekick to Crystal in the City Slicker movies, as well as Wonder Years TV show narrator, and you've got a very watchable, albeit violent but very entertaining comedy.",5,"I Know What You Did Last Summer Scenario Combines With The Hangover, For a Movie This is a Very Good Thing",1286582400,"10 9, 2010",2010,2075,"['Had', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'found', 'national', '2', 'store', 'chain', 'occasionally', 'pick', 'up', 'have', 'interesting', 'covers', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'made', 'found', 'fame', 'lost', 'Slater', 'case', 'are', 'cheaper', 'renting', 'movie', 'Usually', 'are', 'forgettable', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'never', 'made', 'sometimes', 'great', 'movie', 'have', 'just', 'slipped', 'cracks', 'somehow.Basic', 'plot', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'go', 'Vegas', 'days', 'just', 'wedding', 'bachelor', 'party', 'drunken', 'mistake', 'up', 'dead', 'body', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'style', ""'ve"", 'got', 'debate', 'call', 'police', 'dispose', 'body', 'move', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'fisherman', 'hook', 'have', 'enormous', 'guilt', 'building', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'paranoia', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'wives', 'police', 'others', 'Throw', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'brilliantly', 'playing', 'bride', 'hell', 'who', 'perfect', 'wedding', 'tension', 'just', 'greater', 'course', 'would', 'later', 'make', 'big', 'time', 'little', 'movie', 'also', 'filmed', 'same', 'year', '1998', 'called', 'Something', 'Mary.Jon', 'Farveau', 'actor', 'playing', 'groom', 'be', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'going', 'know', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anymore', 'Add', 'fair', 'bit', 'weight', 'loose', 'most', 'hair', 'add', 'goatee', 'recent', 'stuff', ""'ll"", 'work', 'out', 'So', 'cheap', 'buy', 'movie', 'got', 'discussion', 'point', 'watching', 'factor', 'well', 'Slater', 'brilliant', 'character', 'personal', 'life', 'going', 'off', 'tracks', 'had', ""n't"", 'sidetracked', 'big', 'budget', 'films', 'who', 'what', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'star', 'would', 'have', 'achieved', 'bring', 'nice', 'little', 'film', 'Throw', 'older', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'famous', 'earlier', '90s', 'decade', 'work', 'simpleton', 'criminal', 'Home', 'Alone', 'movies', 'sidekick', 'Crystal', 'City', 'Slicker', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'TV', 'show', 'narrator', ""'ve"", 'got', 'very', 'watchable', 'albeit', 'violent', 'very', 'entertaining', 'comedy']",Very Bad Things
460924,A17E28QEX42YU0,6305353549,"Jason ""Hastaj00""","[5, 6]","I really took to 'Very Bad Things' when it came out in '98, and as I watched it the other day with a friend (having not seen it since its run in theatres), I found that I still esteemed the crazed entity with unique fervor.I think what's most commendable about 'Very Bad Things', at least for a person like myself, is that this was actor Peter Berg's directorial debut.  Not for its technical virtues, which it does possess, but because Berg created a picture of such grim ferocity, holding back so little and, most dangerously, for entering the directing world with a product that, by its neccessity, was going to receive near unanimous criticism for its ""distaste"".Here's the thing... Despite the sensationalistic way the film approaches the most horrific of circumstances, I find 'Very Bad Things' almost brings about within me a sense of empathy because, all in all, the five main characters in the film -- a group of old friends -- are not bad people.  Seriously -- how many groups of genuinely decent guys take to Vegas for a buddies' bachelor party?  Furthermore, are they inherently despicable because they're getting loaded, snorting cocaine, and generally acting like crazed little boys the night of the event?  Oh, but one of them is pounding a prostitute -- if none of the other characteristics qualify at making someone evil, surely this one must.  Well, not for me.  By and large, these guys appear as likable middle class schmucks, stuck as so many are within a half-baked life.  Where many find them unlikable without hesitation, I empathize because they are all flawed; once Favreau's soon-to-be wife is introduced (played bitingly by Diaz), it's hard to view him as much more than a pathetic noodle, completely subserviant to the witch behind the beauty.  Then you've got Piven and Stern, playing two dichotomous brothers with a general disdain for each other's personality complex; Piven lively but lost, single and apathetic towards his career, probably acting a bit younger than he should be, while Stern, by contrast, is responsible but neurotic; an uptight family man who's no easier to respect given his Life's accomplishments and anal behaviorisms. Leland Orser's reclusive, enigma of a shy guy doesn't offer much to look up to, and Christian Slater's demented complex made up of a handful of self-help books is easily the most pathetic of the five.  Basically, these guys are all normal in some senses but completely deprived in others, and before the night that begins their descenting journey into madness, none of them, in my eye, could be judged as despicable with any justification (okay, so maybe Slater's could, judging by the real estate selling scene). By the film's fateful  climax, I was pretty fond of the entire group.And so, then, you've got the premise, in my mind; an awful accident occurs in the hotel room in Vegas, and a prostitute is no longer living.  Thing is, it wasn't anyone's fault, unless you are seriously to blame Piven for the act (as if the prostitute wasn't responsible for taking part in the circus act); simply a devestating accident.  Yet, because of the nature of how the system tends to work, an accident that could still prove to bring down more lives as a consequence.  Perhaps if they weren't all coked up, their decision making abilities might have steered them in a better direction.  Nope -- they were high as a kite, and scared as an abandoned baby.  Essentially, from that point on we see them make one mistake after another, usually out of survival instinct, and by no means the rendered act of will.  And so ensues suffering and paranoia for all, reaching a snowball effect until the film finishes.  If you ask me, if these guys weren't relatable or capable of likelihood, the film wouldn't last beyond the intial moment of chaotic hysteria... but it does.Throughout most of it, the film expresses a nice emphasis of exaggeration, and that lends some comedy to the dire consequences that proceed. But, as many have said before me, 'Very Bad Things' doesn't really seem like a comedy.  Slater's character, with his outrageous justifications for their nasty acts, comes as the highpoint of the exaggerated comedy. And yet, it is surely no drama, in the sense of melodrama at least.  Rather, it's just a detatched, furious account of bizzarely interesting but fatal situations of, up 'till this point, people who've never encountered such fearful, life-altering experiences.  Combined with Berg's energetic direction and, overall, impressive, convincing, intense performances -- wavering between seriousness and comedic (my favorites being Piven, Stern, Orser and Diaz') -- the whole thing is just ashamedly entertaining.  It just is.  What else can I say?I think highly moral people might shun the film, but anyone with a knack for fatalism oughta really dig 'Very Bad Things'.  The abuser only abuses because he was abused.  While this might be seen as cowardly, I think we all, at least secretly, view many things from such an angle, especially if events as such hit us or those close to us. Indeed, we are all at the whim of the great magnet who, in this case, just happened to cause the asian hooker to slip on the wet bathroom floor, letting her head gracefully plow through the towel hanger on the wall.It's dark and it's twisted.  It's ugly, for sure.  I myself have no issues with people disliking it, and will at least claim not to judge them for it.  I just hope that those who are in fact repulsed can at least attempt to understand why some may like it, and not judge them in the unrelenting way many seem to judge the film, which sometimes seems to

You may hate yourself in the morning, but you will find yourself laughing at out loud at its worst excesses. Come to think of it, you may hate yourself even while you're watching the movie. But you'll probably laugh anyway.It helps, of course, if you suspect the worst of Christian Slater after reading tabloid accounts of his off-screen misadventures. As Robert Boyd, the self-appointed leader of a bachelor party that gets horribly out of hand, Slater does everything but wink at the audience to signal his eagerness to live down to our expectations.A prostitute accidentally dies during the riotous get-together in a Las Vegas hotel room. Not surprisingly, Robert is the first to suggest that calling the police wouldn't be such a great idea. On the other hand, he thinks it would be a smart move to silence an intrusive security guard. With the utmost reluctance, the groom-to-be (Jon Favreau), the inadvertent killer (Jeremy Piven) and two not-so-innocent bystanders (Daniel Stern, Leland Orser) agree to help David bury their mistakes. Nothing good comes of this.&quot;Very Bad Things&quot; may seem thoroughly amoral, but don't be fooled: There's actually a twisted sense of justice at work here.

It was the first movie I'd ever seen where people walked out of the cinema within the first half hour.  Possibly just after the scene with the stripper in the bathroom...Let me begin my review by saying that I love this movie.  It slaps us in the face with several themes we'd really rather not think about and forces us to for an opinion on situations we'll hopefully never have to encounter.  In many ways the movie resembles &quot;Kill Bill vol. 1.&quot; in that the totally over-the-top nature of the violence renders it cartoon-like and therefore meaningless.  Pretend that this is set in an alternate universe if it makes you feel better...The central theme explored in the movie is &quot;Karma&quot;, the concept that what goes around comes around.  The guys go to Vegas for a bachelor party that goes horribly wrong, and they all end up paying for it in different ways.  Comparisons have been drawn between this movie and &quot;Shallow Grave&quot;, but I'd also say that &quot;Stag&quot; and &quot;Deliverance&quot; are also valid reference points. Cameron Diaz plays the same character she does in &quot;A life less ordinary&quot;, while Jon Favreau revisits &quot;Mikey&quot; from Swingers.The movie is shockingly brutal in it's portrayal of the limits people will go to in order to lead a quiet life, and while the end of the movie does take on a somewhat farcical tone, it is ultimately nice to see the wheel of karma spin right round.If you like black comedies, Vegas and Deliverance, you'll love Very Bad Things.",4,&quot;Did you ask about the chairs?&quot;,1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,1617,"['Let', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'quot', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'quot', 'not', 'everybody', 'was', 'first', 'movie', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'where', 'people', 'walked', 'cinema', 'first', 'hour', 'Possibly', 'just', 'scene', 'stripper', 'bathroom', 'Let', 'begin', 'review', 'saying', 'love', 'movie', 'face', 'several', 'themes', ""'d"", 'really', 'rather', 'not', 'think', 'forces', 'opinion', 'situations', ""'ll"", 'hopefully', 'never', 'have', 'encounter', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'quot', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'vol', '1.', 'quot', 'totally', 'over-the-top', 'nature', 'violence', 'renders', 'cartoon-like', 'therefore', 'meaningless', 'Pretend', 'set', 'alternate', 'universe', 'feel', 'better', 'central', 'theme', 'explored', 'movie', 'quot', 'Karma', 'quot', 'concept', 'what', 'around', 'around', 'guys', 'go', 'Vegas', 'bachelor', 'party', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'end', 'up', 'paying', 'different', 'ways', 'Comparisons', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'movie', 'quot', 'Shallow', 'Grave', 'quot', ""'d"", 'also', 'say', 'quot', 'Stag', 'quot', 'quot', 'Deliverance', 'quot', 'are', 'also', 'valid', 'reference', 'points', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'same', 'character', 'quot', 'A', 'life', 'less', 'ordinary', 'quot', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'quot', 'Mikey', 'quot', 'Swingers.The', 'movie', 'shockingly', 'brutal', 'portrayal', 'limits', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'order', 'lead', 'quiet', 'life', 'end', 'movie', 'take', 'somewhat', 'farcical', 'tone', 'ultimately', 'nice', 'see', 'wheel', 'karma', 'spin', 'right', 'black', 'comedies', 'Vegas', 'Deliverance', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things']",Very Bad Things

Normally, by the time the credits start to roll, I've got a fair idea of what I will say. In this case, I first had to figure out what it was I had just seen.The movie is all energy and no substance. It tries very hard to be a black comedy, but that genre requires that the audience relate to its outrageousness. Very Bad Things gets right up in your face. It is one of the loudest, most abrasive movies I have ever seen. It doesn't work as a ""buddy-buddy"" picture either, because nobody's anybody's pal here. Every single character turns out to be dislikable, which works in mysteries and psychological thrillers. In other words, I can't tell you if this is a comedy, a drama or a thriller.Kyle [Jon Faureu] is about to marry Laura [Cameron Diaz]. We never know why. We do know that Laura is one mean, pushy, self-centered girl. Some of his buddies are intent on taking him to Las Vegas for a bachelor blowout. [For some reason, Vegas has become the symbol of sin in the movies recently. I don't know why. Maybe because it is close to Los Angeles.] There they gamble, get drunk, do drugs and wind up in their suite with a call girl, who is provided by their ring leader, Robert [Christian Slater]. During the wild party, the girl is accidentally killed. Rather than ruin their lives, not to mention Kyle's wedding, they bury the body in the desert.Back in L A, they attempt to resume their normal lives, which includes Kyle's marriage to the dreaded Laura. Several members of the group begin to fall apart, and the ever resourceful Robert decides to take care of the situation. You can imagine how.Cameron Diaz and Jon Faureu give decent performance. The rest of the cast shouts a lot and makes silly faces. Christian Slater, a talented actor who once seemed destined to take Jack Nicholson's place, is especially disappointing.Something tells me that the cast had a very good time making Very Bad Things. Unfortunately, they are like a bunch of mad scientists who have no idea what the results of their work will turn out to be. Writer-driector Peter Berg may indeed be fun to work with, but he has a lot to learn about the subtleties of movie making, as well as about what is entertaining.What ultimately brings the film down is its graphic violence. Personally, I find it hard to laugh when my stomach is turning. My dislike of gratuitous violence is not a political. It's simply a turn off. It's like someone telling you a joke, and then punching you in the ribs and screaming, ""Get it? Get it? Get it?""One thing does disturb me. Very Bad Things is one of several recent high profile movies that are literally mean-spirited. I hope this turns out to be a fluke rather than a trend. The best pictures may sometimes be about mean events, but they are somehow civil about it.",2,"Dark, cynical comedy misses its mark",1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,2912,"['Can', 'imagine', 'what', 'write', 'review', 'when', 'are', 'loss', 'words', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'when', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'ended', 'Normally', 'time', 'credits', 'start', 'roll', ""'ve"", 'got', 'fair', 'idea', 'what', 'will', 'say', 'case', 'first', 'had', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'had', 'just', 'seen.The', 'movie', 'energy', 'substance', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'black', 'comedy', 'genre', 'audience', 'relate', 'outrageousness', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'right', 'up', 'face', 'one', 'loudest', 'most', 'abrasive', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', ""n't"", 'work', 'buddy-buddy', 'picture', 'nobody', 'anybody', 'pal', 'here', 'Every', 'single', 'character', 'out', 'be', 'dislikable', 'mysteries', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'other', 'words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'comedy', 'drama', 'thriller.Kyle', '[', 'Jon', 'Faureu', ']', 'marry', 'Laura', '[', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', ']', 'never', 'know', 'why', 'do', 'know', 'Laura', 'one', 'mean', 'pushy', 'self-centered', 'girl', 'buddies', 'are', 'intent', 'taking', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'bachelor', 'blowout', '[', 'reason', 'Vegas', 'become', 'symbol', 'sin', 'movies', 'recently', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Maybe', 'close', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'gamble', 'get', 'drunk', 'do', 'drugs', 'wind', 'up', 'suite', 'call', 'girl', 'who', 'provided', 'ring', 'leader', 'Robert', '[', 'Christian', 'Slater', ']', 'wild', 'party', 'girl', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'Rather', 'ruin', 'lives', 'not', 'mention', 'Kyle', 'wedding', 'bury', 'body', 'desert.Back', 'L', 'A', 'attempt', 'resume', 'normal', 'lives', 'Kyle', 'marriage', 'dreaded', 'Laura', 'Several', 'members', 'group', 'begin', 'fall', 'apart', 'ever', 'resourceful', 'Robert', 'take', 'care', 'situation', 'can', 'imagine', 'how.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Jon', 'Faureu', 'give', 'decent', 'performance', 'rest', 'cast', 'lot', 'silly', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'once', 'seemed', 'destined', 'take', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'place', 'especially', 'disappointing.Something', 'tells', 'cast', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'time', 'making', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'bunch', 'mad', 'scientists', 'who', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'results', 'work', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Writer-driector', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'fun', 'work', 'lot', 'learn', 'subtleties', 'movie', 'making', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'ultimately', 'film', 'down', 'graphic', 'violence', 'Personally', 'find', 'hard', 'laugh', 'when', 'stomach', 'turning', 'dislike', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'not', 'political', 'simply', 'turn', 'off', 'someone', 'telling', 'joke', 'then', 'punching', 'ribs', 'screaming', 'Get', 'Get', 'Get', 'One', 'thing', 'disturb', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'one', 'several', 'recent', 'high', 'profile', 'movies', 'are', 'literally', 'mean-spirited', 'hope', 'out', 'be', 'fluke', 'rather', 'trend', 'best', 'pictures', 'may', 'sometimes', 'be', 'mean', 'events', 'are', 'somehow', 'civil']",Very Bad Things

In other words,  Siskel and Ebert used the term &quot;idiot plot&quot; to describe a  scenario where the story would end in two minutes if the characters just  told the truth, which 99% of the audience would normally do.  Suspencion of  belief is something to be excepted in an exteralized conflict (even in  something as stupid as Independence Day) but in a situation where  everything hinges on an internal decision, that decision must be a  reasonable thing to do.  As I sat there watching Christian Slater reason  that they should hide the corpse in a desert, I knew that the reasoning  offered was not that of a believable character but a contriving  screenwriter who decided to make a character forty times stupider than  himself as a launch pad for the plot.  Everything that happens afterwards  is corrupted by the idiocy of the character reasoning in this scene.On  the other hands, Very Bad Things, once the characters are out of the hotel  room is a hilarious send up of something though it is often very heavy  handed - a character throws himself in front of a moving car to protect his  minivan (why do minivans take so much abuse in today's anti-suburban  propaganda?).",2,I can see both sides.,955929600,"04 17, 2000",2000,1534,"['one', 'rare', 'occaisions', 'where', 'can', 'read', 'extremely', 'good', 'extremely', 'bad', 'reviews', 'film', 'understand', 'where', 'parties', 'are', 'coming', 'from.Very', 'bad', 'things', 'one', 'hand', 'poor', 'movie', 'one', 'commandments', 'plotting', 'film', 'Thou', 'plot', 'shall', 'not', 'derive', 'entirely', 'characters', 'illogic', 'duplicity', 'other', 'words', 'Siskel', 'Ebert', 'used', 'term', 'quot', 'plot', 'quot', 'describe', 'scenario', 'where', 'story', 'would', 'end', 'two', 'minutes', 'characters', 'just', 'told', 'truth', '99', '%', 'audience', 'would', 'normally', 'do', 'Suspencion', 'belief', 'something', 'be', 'excepted', 'exteralized', 'conflict', 'even', 'something', 'as', 'stupid', 'Independence', 'Day', 'situation', 'where', 'everything', 'hinges', 'internal', 'decision', 'decision', 'must', 'be', 'reasonable', 'thing', 'do', 'sat', 'there', 'watching', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'reason', 'should', 'hide', 'corpse', 'desert', 'knew', 'reasoning', 'offered', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'character', 'contriving', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'decided', 'make', 'character', 'forty', 'times', 'stupider', 'launch', 'pad', 'plot', 'Everything', 'afterwards', 'corrupted', 'idiocy', 'character', 'reasoning', 'scene.On', 'other', 'hands', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'once', 'characters', 'are', 'hotel', 'room', 'hilarious', 'send', 'something', 'often', 'very', 'heavy', 'handed', 'character', 'front', 'moving', 'car', 'protect', 'minivan', 'why', 'do', 'minivans', 'take', 'so', 'much', 'abuse', 'today', 'anti-suburban', 'propaganda']",Very Bad Things

Berg, who both wrote and directed, was out to redefine the black comedy as we know it. And when you get that black, you get into territory where you're almost certain to lose your audience.

His best man, Robert Boyd (Christian Slater), and a few of their pals decide to take Kyle to Vegas for his bachelor party. During the festivities, a prostitute dies by accident. From there on, the film details what they decide to do with the body, and how it affects each of the party members. Doesn't sound like gut-wrenchingly funny stuff, does it? But Berg consistently goes over the top with it, sometimes more subtly than others. I've got one of the sickest senses of humor I know, and I found the chuckles few and far between until about a half hour before the end of the film, but that didn't bother me much. The interaction between the characters was absorbing enough to keep me interested until the laughs started coming regularly. And when they do, boy do they ever. You're left at the end of this film thinking that it was a two-hour shaggy dog joke, that the whole film was built around what may be one of the most hysterical-- and memorable-- final scenes in all of filmdom. But this is one of those jokes where the punchline is so perfect that you don't mind having to listen to two hours of setup. It's certainly not for everyone, but if you like your humor just this side of insanity, you'll laugh as hard as I did at that last scene. *** ",4,"""Is there a sign in my front yard saying dead hooker storage?""",1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,1911,"['Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'Peter', 'Berg', '1998', '[', 'originally', 'posted', '22Oct2000', ']', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'Very', 'good', 'film.Before', 'going', 'further', 'let', 'clarify', 'may', 'be', 'asking', 'yes', 'THAT', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'Dr.', 'Kronk.This', 'movie', 'risky', 'hell', 'Berg', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'was', 'redefine', 'black', 'comedy', 'know', 'when', 'get', 'black', 'get', 'territory', 'where', ""'re"", 'almost', 'certain', 'lose', 'audience', 'case', 'Berg', 'determination', 'cross', 'line', 'cross', 'as', 'often', 'necessary', 'film', 'typical', 'black', 'comedy', 'something', 'worth', 'watching.Kyle', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'getting', 'married', 'Laura', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'best', 'man', 'Robert', 'Boyd', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'few', 'pals', 'decide', 'take', 'Kyle', 'Vegas', 'bachelor', 'party', 'festivities', 'prostitute', 'accident', 'there', 'film', 'details', 'what', 'decide', 'do', 'body', 'how', 'party', 'members', 'Does', ""n't"", 'sound', 'gut-wrenchingly', 'funny', 'stuff', 'Berg', 'consistently', 'top', 'sometimes', 'more', 'subtly', 'others', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'sickest', 'senses', 'humor', 'know', 'found', 'chuckles', 'few', 'far', 'half', 'hour', 'end', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'interaction', 'characters', 'was', 'absorbing', 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', 'laughs', 'started', 'coming', 'regularly', 'when', 'do', 'boy', 'do', 'ever', ""'re"", 'left', 'end', 'film', 'thinking', 'was', 'two-hour', 'shaggy', 'dog', 'joke', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'built', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'hysterical', 'memorable', 'final', 'scenes', 'filmdom', 'one', 'jokes', 'where', 'punchline', 'so', 'perfect', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'having', 'listen', 'two', 'hours', 'setup', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone', 'like', 'humor', 'just', 'side', 'insanity', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'as', 'hard', 'did', 'last', 'scene', '***']",Very Bad Things

I thought &quot;Fargo&quot; was great.  VBT, however, does not work for me as entertainment;  I think this is for  one very simple reason:  the plot centers around the murder (or  manslaughter) of a prostitute by a hopped-up John, and this -- wake up  folks -- is not fantasy but something that happens every goddamn day all  over the world.  I have heard that the cops in LA and NYC don't even start  investigating the deaths of hookers till they reach double digits per  month.So, umm, a bunch of rich white guys killing a hooker and then a  black security guard just doesn't strike me as unrealistic enough to be  funny.This is a fantastically misanthropic film;  the only person with a  conscience gets killed off only half way through, and though in the end the  bad guys get what's coming to them, it hardly qualifies as a morality play.  There is no one you can like in this cast of characters.  The writing and  directing has a cold and depressing quality; the general mode is one of  deep contempt for humanity, a sort of vicious post-Swiftian accidie.The  only bright points for me were its uncompromising illumination of just how  stupidly grown men behave when in packs, and (here I'll give it four stars)  its cruelly accurate dissection of the selfish amorality behind most  popular &quot;self-help&quot; pseudo-philosophies.  Slater makes a truly  demonic villain, but again he is just a bit too real to be comfortably  hilarious -- I get the feeling that there are people just like him running  many major corporations :-)It's true one can have more than enough of  trad Hollywood feel-good fare, but I think VBT is not the right antidote.  It has the Tarantino disease, a kind of cold creeping nastiness that offers  sadism in place of wit and blood-n-guts shock value in place of any real  originality.  See it for Slater's virtuoso performance -- it's a classic,  right up there with Peter Lorre at his scariest and funniest -- but don't  expect to feel cheerful afterwards.

460958,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,6305353549,Scrimshaw,"[0, 0]","Very Bad Things is a 1998 dark comedy film written and directed by Peter Berg. This film came out the same year as another notoriously black comedy called Happiness, which I felt was slightly better, and darker, than this film. Very Bad Things stars Jon Favreau and Cameron Diaz as Kyle and Laura, two fiances about to get married, as well as four of Kyle's friends Charles (Leland Orser), Robert (Christian Slater), Adam (Daniel Stern), and Michael (Jeremy Piven). Very Bad Things was a indeed very bad, in my humble opinion. It felt incredibly cruel, annoying, empty, and pathetic, with many pointless scenes, such as the one with Adam and his family at the gas station. For starters, I didn't like any of the characters, especially Laura and Adam, and in more than half of the film the characters are endlessly yelling and screaming to the point that I wanted to rip out their vocal cords. I was pleasantly surprised and even joyful when many of the characters, such as Adam and Robert, died, or met with tragic ends despite still being alive, such as Laura, because they were so annoying and unlikable. I guess the theme of this film is bad things happen to bad people, which is certainly true in real life, so if there are any positives to this film, that is certainly one of them. Also, despite being an apparent comedy, this film rarely made me laugh or even smile, there were a few scenes that did, to be completely honest, but most of the time I was angered and annoyed. Don't waste your time on this film, there are far better comedies, and even dark comedies, out there, so if you pass this one on, you won't be missing anything. The Basic Plot, which consists of events spiraling more and more out of control after the five male characters kill a stripper and security guard at a Las Vegas Hotel where they were having a crazy drunken bachelor party several days before the wedding of Kyle and Laura, is both predictable and cliched. It felt like a darker, less funny, version of The Hangover in many ways. The only thing that kept this film from a one star rating were a few funny scenes and the semi-intelligent theme of bad things happening to bad people, which certainly appeals to me, who is a strong believer in karma and the notion that one reaps what one sows. This film is a prime example of everything that's wrong in the cultural wasteland of modern America. Also if you enjoy dark comedies, a few I would highly recommend would be Arsenic and Old Lace, Little Miss Sunshine, and Dr. Strangelove.",2,Very Bad Comedy!

All hell breaks lose and from that point on things get worse and worse for everyone involved.This is definitely a movie for those that don't mind laughing at the horrors in life!,4,A Hilarious comedy!,985132800,"03 21, 2001",2001,357,"['found', 'movie', 'be', 'hilarious', 'dark', 'plot', 'maybe', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'dark', 'plot.It', 'boys', 'going', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'bachelor', 'party', 'hell', 'breaks', 'lose', 'point', 'things', 'get', 'worse', 'worse', 'everyone', 'involved.This', 'definitely', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'laughing', 'horrors', 'life']",Very Bad Things

The movie is just one annoying situation after another.If you want a great, dramatic guy flick that revolves around a bachelor party, get Stag (1997).  It's done right!Other great isolation films to watch at night:  Judgment Night, The Trigger Effect, Midnight Express, Deep Rising, Cube Zero.",1,"Utter garbage!

Ross,"[0, 0]","I was drawn to this movie because it was billed as a &quot;dark comedy&quot; I thought that meant that it was supposed to be funny, at least on some level.  But, it wasn't funny (darkly or in any other way).  It was not suspensful because it was predictable.  It did however feature a  very hip cast... except for Daniel Stern and Leland Orser who provided us  with the extremities of acting (overacting and no acting).  This movie  reminded me of the late HBO series Tales From the Crypt, minus the  cryptkeeper.",2,A Very Bad Thing,963964800,"07 19, 2000",2000,513,"['was', 'drawn', 'movie', 'was', 'billed', 'quot', 'dark', 'comedy', 'quot', 'thought', 'meant', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'least', 'level', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'darkly', 'other', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'suspensful', 'was', 'predictable', 'did', 'however', 'feature', 'very', 'hip', 'cast', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'Leland', 'Orser', 'who', 'provided', 'extremities', 'acting', 'overacting', 'acting', 'movie', 'reminded', 'late', 'HBO', 'series', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'minus', 'cryptkeeper']",Very Bad Things
