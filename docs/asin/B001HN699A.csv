1201396,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B001HN699A,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[2, 4]","I wasn't exactly sure of what I was getting into when I was getting ready to watch this film. I had never read the story, so I basically went in with no idea of what it could be. What I got was one of the best kid films ever made. However, this seems to be the kind of film that will catch on twenty years from now, because our current generation just does not get it (It's pretty sad when some people hold the Alvin and the Chipmunks films in higher regard as kid films). From what I'm guessing, people seem to think this film is too complicated for kids and even some adults. This is a great film for both kids and adults alike and it teaches valuable lessons and is much smarter than most kid films I've seen in recent memory.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Max is a nine-year-old kid with what appears to be family problems. His mom and his sister don't seem to pay attention to him, and it appears his father died (Or left, we're not told why he's not there). Max also seems to get easily upset over things and then regrets it shortly afterward. But when he and his mom fight and he bites her, he runs away, takes a boat, sails across the ocean, and finds a mysterious island inhabited by large furry creatures. When the creatures attempt to eat him, he makes up a wild story about how he's the king of the world and they obey him. At first, being king is fun and everyone is getting along with each other through games and building a huge fort. But after a period of time, things start to fall apart and the creatures begin fighting with each other, and from then on, things go from bad to worse.MUSIC: The music is very strange, and yet it fits the mood and is very likable. I don't have any gripes with this film's music.ACTING: The acting is actually really good and I can't seem to think of any problems with it. Though the main character is troubled, you do eventually form attachment to him. No problems here either.ACTION: This is mostly dialogue-focused, but it also has a lot of fun moments like when they're playing games with each other. But the seemingly simple plot is also very engaging and has a surprising level of complexity. I was rarely bored (Though there were a few moments of slow pacing) when watching this fantastic film because it had so much depth and meaning, and it was a very engaging and emotional experience.OVERALL: If you can't take complex or depressing kid films, or if you're easily bored, then you should probably avoid it. However, if you are craving an actual good kid film and you're tired of the crap that is plaguing Hollywood and giving kid films a bad name, then watch Where the Wild Things Are because it is an amazing experience.THE GOOD: Complex and meaningful plot, great acting, great music, engaging characters, and it's rarely ever boring.THE BAD: There are a few moments of boredom.",5,A CHILDREN'S FILM LIKE NO OTHER  9.5 OUT OF 10,1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,2825,"['was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'when', 'was', 'getting', 'ready', 'watch', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'story', 'basically', 'went', 'idea', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'kid', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'However', 'be', 'kind', 'film', 'will', 'catch', 'twenty', 'years', 'now', 'current', 'generation', 'just', 'not', 'get', 'pretty', 'sad', 'when', 'people', 'hold', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'films', 'higher', 'regard', 'kid', 'films', 'what', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'people', 'seem', 'think', 'film', 'too', 'complicated', 'kids', 'even', 'adults', 'great', 'film', 'kids', 'adults', 'alike', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'much', 'smarter', 'most', 'kid', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'memory.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Max', 'nine-year-old', 'kid', 'what', 'be', 'family', 'problems', 'mom', 'sister', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'pay', 'attention', 'father', 'died', 'Or', 'left', ""'re"", 'not', 'told', 'why', 'not', 'there', 'Max', 'also', 'get', 'easily', 'upset', 'things', 'then', 'shortly', 'afterward', 'when', 'mom', 'fight', 'away', 'boat', 'ocean', 'mysterious', 'island', 'inhabited', 'large', 'furry', 'creatures', 'When', 'creatures', 'attempt', 'eat', 'up', 'wild', 'story', 'how', 'king', 'world', 'obey', 'first', 'being', 'king', 'fun', 'everyone', 'getting', 'along', 'other', 'games', 'building', 'huge', 'fort', 'period', 'time', 'things', 'start', 'fall', 'apart', 'creatures', 'begin', 'fighting', 'other', 'then', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse.MUSIC', 'music', 'very', 'strange', 'yet', 'mood', 'very', 'likable', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'gripes', 'film', 'music.ACTING', 'acting', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'think', 'problems', 'main', 'character', 'troubled', 'do', 'eventually', 'form', 'attachment', 'problems', 'here', 'either.ACTION', 'mostly', 'dialogue-focused', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'moments', 'when', ""'re"", 'playing', 'games', 'other', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'plot', 'also', 'very', 'engaging', 'surprising', 'level', 'complexity', 'was', 'rarely', 'bored', 'were', 'few', 'moments', 'slow', 'pacing', 'when', 'watching', 'fantastic', 'film', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'meaning', 'was', 'very', 'engaging', 'emotional', 'experience.OVERALL', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'complex', 'depressing', 'kid', 'films', ""'re"", 'easily', 'bored', 'then', 'should', 'probably', 'avoid', 'However', 'are', 'craving', 'actual', 'good', 'kid', 'film', ""'re"", 'tired', 'crap', 'plaguing', 'Hollywood', 'giving', 'kid', 'bad', 'name', 'then', 'watch', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'amazing', 'experience.THE', 'GOOD', 'Complex', 'meaningful', 'plot', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'music', 'engaging', 'characters', 'rarely', 'ever', 'boring.THE', 'BAD', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'boredom']",Where the Wild Things Are

1201398,A22Z554ZQ8NFPC,B001HN699A,"AF ""Whigs""","[5, 7]","This movie, as with many recent adaptations of children's books, greatly expands on Maurice Sendak's simple classic.  However I think it's important to note that it sticks to the spirit of the original book, IMO, but updates it to a more modern sensibility.There's a palpable sense of longing and lonliness in Max, as well as many/most of the Wild Thing characters.  The movie touches on general themes of friendship, family, anger, loss, the hurt - both intentional and not - that takes place in close relationships, but doesn't try to spoon feed any easy answers or come out with over-simple logic to wrap everything up in a neat bow.  It leaves things ragged, but somewhat resolved, but I think there's value in acknowledging these things, these problems we all encounter, without trying to pretend that simple solutions exist.This is a dark, but wonderful, movie.  Young kids may find it scary in places, but our 5 year old daughter managed just fine once she realized that Max wasn't going to get eaten by the Wild Things.This is a hard movie to summarize, but to me it is very powerful in how it conveys emotions and experiences that can relate on a universal level.  And it's not dumbed down for anyone.  It is well worth watching and frankly it's refreshing to find a family movie with this kind of emotional depth and that also lacks the overt cynicism and condenscending attitude toward the audience that is so common with family movies.Probably the biggest strike against this movie is that it's not something you would watch frequently.  It's too heavy for that, IMO - at least for my tastes.",4,"Excellent family film - but not an ""easy"" movie",1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,1604,"['movie', 'many', 'recent', 'adaptations', 'children', 'books', 'greatly', 'Maurice', 'Sendak', 'simple', 'classic', 'However', 'think', 'important', 'note', 'spirit', 'original', 'book', 'IMO', 'more', 'modern', 'palpable', 'sense', 'longing', 'lonliness', 'Max', 'as', 'well', 'many/most', 'Wild', 'Thing', 'characters', 'movie', 'touches', 'general', 'themes', 'friendship', 'family', 'anger', 'loss', 'hurt', 'intentional', 'not', 'place', 'close', 'relationships', ""n't"", 'try', 'spoon', 'feed', 'easy', 'answers', 'come', 'out', 'over-simple', 'logic', 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', 'neat', 'bow', 'things', 'ragged', 'somewhat', 'resolved', 'think', 'value', 'acknowledging', 'things', 'problems', 'encounter', 'trying', 'pretend', 'simple', 'solutions', 'exist.This', 'dark', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Young', 'kids', 'may', 'find', 'scary', 'places', '5', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'managed', 'just', 'fine', 'once', 'realized', 'Max', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'eaten', 'Wild', 'Things.This', 'hard', 'movie', 'summarize', 'very', 'powerful', 'how', 'conveys', 'emotions', 'experiences', 'can', 'relate', 'universal', 'level', 'not', 'dumbed', 'down', 'anyone', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'frankly', 'refreshing', 'find', 'family', 'movie', 'kind', 'emotional', 'depth', 'also', 'overt', 'cynicism', 'condenscending', 'attitude', 'audience', 'so', 'common', 'family', 'movies.Probably', 'biggest', 'strike', 'movie', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'watch', 'frequently', 'too', 'heavy', 'IMO', 'least', 'tastes']",Where the Wild Things Are

1201402,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001HN699A,Andrew Ellington,"[22, 33]","I'm going to try and contain myself while writing this review, holding back from blurting out things like ""masterpiece"" and ""greatest film of the year"" and ""pure, unbridled brilliance"" every other sentence.  The fact remains that I've been chomping at the bit to write this for some time, and those three phrases (and many more) have been flying around my head for months now.  In fact, the more films I see from this year the more I am convinced that, not only is this the best film of the year, but it may quite possibly be one of THE best films I've ever seen; ever.Okay, composure.I'm a gigantic fan of the book by Maurice Sendak.  What I love so much about the book is that it is far from your average children's book, yet what I find so funny is that so many consider it one.  I don't think many people truly understand the point behind the book, and so I was so happy when I saw this film because it completely GOT the point.`Where the Wild Things Are' is quite simply a story about what it feels like to BE a child.  It is not a story for children as much as one ABOUT them, from their level but completely poignant and provoking.  While the book may appear simple (it is extremely short) it is far from it, for it really evokes a real emotional connection in the reader.  Spike Jonze beautifully captured the essence of this story with his unique vision, proving to be a complement to what Sendak already established.  I have read the complaints by some (including critics and friends) and to them I just have to say that they seem to miss the point entirely.  One of my friends even said, after all of his complaining about the script (which is one of the most spectacular parts of this film BTW) that it seemed to capture ""what it felt like to be a child"" and to me that just completely blew his entire argument out of the water.That was the entire point of the film, and so, if it accomplished that then it did its job.The film focuses on Max, a young boy who is having it tough.  He lives in a single parent family with his mother and sister.  Neither seem to have enough time for him.  His sister has her friends and her life and they don't seem to have any care or concern for Max (which can be seen in a heartbreaking sequence involving a snow-fort).  His mother is struggling to provide for her kids and maintain an active dating life and so this leaves Max feeling neglected.  After a serious blowup at home, we find Max fleeing his home in a rage and soon he is sailing, by boat, to the land of the Wild Things.  Here he meets a slew of strange creatures living together.  You have Carol, the apparent leader; Douglas, his closest companion; Ira and Judith, the bickering couple; Alexander, the outcast; The Bull, the mysterious one and KW, the voice of reason.  When Max first encounters the clan, Carol is being quite destructive.  He is brokenhearted by KW's decision to leave their group for her `new friends'.  The presence of Max brings out another side to him though, as he sees companionship and possibilities he had lost sight of.Soon, Max is one of the gang.For me, watching `Where the Wild Things Are' is an overwhelming experience.  There are so many facets of this film that move me in ways I never expected, and the more I see it (I broke my record with `theater' visits on this one), the more I am in love with it.The film is really one figurative overlay after another.  Everything we witness relates to Max's life beautifully, despite their apparent ambiguities.  I think that is something that I love so much about this film, for the more I discuss it with friends the more I can see their input and see their `understanding' of the film.  For instance, the inclusion of KW's friends was a point of major interest with my circle, especially the fact that Max and Carol were the only ones who couldn't understand what they were saying.  Some of friends thought immediately that they represented Max's sister's friends, but for me this was a beautiful way to symbolize the fact that children so often fail to understand adults.  These two new faces, as wise as they were supposed to be, proved to be foolish to Max and Carol because they simply couldn't understand them.I also found this to be a wonderful example of how children, bless their souls, all too often take things far too literally.The film is a wonderful life lesson as regards to the relationship that children have with their parents and the eventual understanding for the need of headship and guidance.  As Max dwells with the group he becomes their King and soon becomes the figurative representation of his own mother.  The reversal of the very phrase ""I'll eat you up"" has such a beautiful meaning here.  In the films outset, Max, in anger, uses that phrase as a dagger pointed at his mother's heart.  In the films conclusion Max hears those very words, from a dear friend, tinged with such sincere beauty and love.  For me, this symbolizes that love and respect that children automatically form for their parents.  Even in rage they cannot help but ultimately rely on their parents.  While his words were meant to hurt, there was love wrapped up in that very statement.He was hurting, and so while his words `hurt' they were spoken with love.Some have balked at the ending (just let them eat cake) but for me, it was such a soft and sincere way to end the film, beautifully capturing the films point, message and moral without shoving it down our throats.  This film is a brilliant example of how you can get a point across and ultimately become something so lovingly sympathetic and touching without adding layers of unnecessary schmaltz.  There is nothing saccharine about this film, and yet it manages to elicit very real emotions from the audience (I cried, twice).Now, I just want to mention the acting for a minute, because it really deserves it.  I just want to mention three names, because there really isn't time to get into everyone.  Max Records, Catherine Keener and James Gandolfini.  First of all, Max Records delivers one of the greatest child performances I've ever seen.  His grasp of childlike innocence was outstanding.  He really has to carry this film, and he makes every minor flinch feel so authentic and so natural.  When he explains how he is a King I just had this gushing smile on my face because he really GOT it.  He didn't overdo it, trying to be more mature than he was.  In fact, his character's attempt to be more mature was deemed effective because of the choppy and `unconvincing way' in which Records delivered it.  You could tell that this was a KID.  Keener is only used briefly, but there is such warmth and heartfelt beauty in her performance.  She really captures what it meant to be a mother, trapped in her own skin and trying to be there for her child.  In fact, that final scene, with the cake, was like icing for her splendid performance.And then we have James Gandolfini!  I have never really been one to praise a performance that was entirely CGI or motion capture or whatever you want to call it.  I can't do that this time though, for what Gandolfini does here is above and beyond sublime.  The genuine warmth and authenticity that he brings to Carol is just spellbinding.  As you watch his facial gestures you see the heart and soul of this `man'.  He beautifully captures the same childlike innocence that Records conveys, but he goes a step further to represent the downward spiral marvelously, allowing Max to observe and reflect on what he is seeing.  His love, his haste, his panic, his pain, his sorrow, his anger; everything is perfectly conveyed yet it never seems too perfect.There is always the air of something being `off' that makes everything feel so richly honest.Honest, that is exactly what this movie is to me.  So, with my review done I'm going to give way to my initial urges and just let it all out.  This movie is pure, unbridled brilliance; easily the greatest film of the year and, without a doubt, a masterpiece!Oh yeah, and I just wanted to say; this is my two-year-old's favorite book and she LOVED this movie, talked about it for weeks and sat through it a second time (I didn't take her every time I saw it) with wide-eyed adoration.  Yes, this movie has dark themes and can be overwhelming emotionally at times (but that is more on the adult side than anything else), but it is still a film that children can and will enjoy.  When someone has the ridiculous audacity to say that this film is NOT for children I can't help but laugh, because they sound so stupid.",5,Where you can find my beating heart...,1264377600,"01 25,

Spike Jonze and his team have worked extraordinary magic in bringing Sendak's very spare story to the screen as a film running 104 minutes. The conceit is that of Alice in Wonderland and the trick is of course, that Max runs away from home and has all manner of adventures in the land of the Wild Things then sails back (for nearly a year and many weeks besides and a day too,) right back to his bedroom where his meal is waiting for him (and it's still warm!) So Spike Jonze and his cohorts had a huge job to create a full length film from a skeletal story book, but it's all good - the casting of Max Records, who was 11, I think, when the film was made, in the lead role, the creation of the monsters - and their voices,  and the introduction of many underlying philosophical leitmotifs.Of course it's a movie for adults, and a movie for young children to watch with their parents.

1201407,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B001HN699A,Armando N. Roman,"[3, 5]","I waited years for this movie. From the very first teaser trailer that played before How the Grinch Stole Christmas about 10 years ago, to the test footage, I couldn't wait to see this movie. I didn't care that it would be based on my favorite children's book which only had several sentences that made up the plot. The fact was, I was going to see Wild things. REAL Wild Things. The first official trailer that played before Monsters vs Aliens last year made Where the Wild Things are look like it was going to be one of the most incredible experiences ever. It looked like it had everything! Wild Things throwing eachother, rock fights, everyone running around, fire, explosions, tons of stuff that we could only use our imaginations to figure out what was going on, just like in the book.Then I saw the movie.The whole time I was in the theater, I was on the edge of my seat because I was waiting for something to happen. I actually waited a few months before seeing it in theaters, because I wanted to go when there'd be few or no people, so I could watch it without distractions. All the reviews were either declaring that the movie was a work of art, or that it was boring and nothing happened. Sadly, I'm with the bored people. This isn't a movie for kids, but not in the sense that it's violent or anything- it just has themes that adults will get. This is for adults being nostalgic about being a kid and what it was like to feel these things. Kids 12 or under will most likely be bored.The story basically follows the book, but with more structure (I guess). Max is a young boy who's just trying to be a kid, but his older sister doesn't pay much attention to him when her friends are around, and his mom's trying to hold a job while dating. Max dresses up in his wolf suit one night, bites his mom, and runs away. He discovers a boat, hops in, and ends up in a land where the Wild Things are. Just as they're about to eat him, he tells them that they shouldn't, because of how strong he is. This interests Carol, the apparent leader of the group, and they let him live, making Max their new king. They work together on making a fort and...ok, that's really it. The rest is dialogue.Don't get me wrong- I tend to love 'boring' movies (like There Will Be Blood). But so much of the movie is dialogue without any real character development, that I couldn't connect with any of the characters. I kept waiting for something to happen, but there were only a few stand out scenes that lasted a few seconds. Everything else was shown in the trailer. There's just so little I liked about this movie, and I hate that. I wanted to love this movie. The cinematography, locations, and especially the Wild Things costumes are all flawless, and it's a shame Where the Wild Things Are didn't get nominated for any awards, especially in costumes. They looked like real creatures, and their faces showed so much emotion that it makes you wonder why bigger budget movies with CG creatures (the Wild Things' faces were animated) don't look even half this good. The movie also kind of rips you off in having the most wild scene at the very beginning when Max goes nuts trying to get the family dog. It was a perfect way to start the movie, but the only other scene that lives up to that, in terms of wild-ness, is near the end when one Wild Thing's arm gets ripped off. Don't worry though parents, it looks like sand and rocks comes out of the socket. As for the Wild Things themselves, the characters are supposed to represent a different emotion, but a couple, especially Judith, just come off as annoying. Carol seems to be a manic depressive, and we never really learn why the creatures are sad most of the time. Carol's question for Max is if he can make the sadness go away when going over what he can all do. If we learned a little more about each Wild Thing, I think I might've liked more than just one or two.For the blu-ray, the picture and audio quality are great. I have no complaints in either category, and you also have the option for Spanish and French audio tracks. I'm glad they didn't mess up the picture transfer, because many of the shots here are gorgeous, and the crisp visuals are allowed to be seen as they were intended.There's a good amount of special features here as well, but nothing too special. The main treat is Higglety Pigglety Pop!, an animated/live action short based on Maurice Sendak's other well-known book. I love this story and seeing it advertised on the box was a big surprise, and enjoying every second of it was an extra bonus. Check it out. There's also an episode of HBO First Look for the movie, and a series of shorts by Lance Bangs that focuses on different aspects of making WTWTA. These are cool, especially Vampire Attack, and it was fun seeing the cast and crew did something with Spike Jonze's scooter. There's no commentary track, or extensive interviews with Maurice Sendak, but what's here is alright, and this is probably the most we'll ever get.I watched this movie 4 times before finalizing my decision that I just plain didn't like it. Again, it pains me to say that, especially considering how much work went into everything. I was about ready to cry the first time I saw the trailer and saw all the Wild Things come to life. Sadly, there wasn't much life in them. I don't get how some people can say that every character is deep when most of the time is spent with Carol and KW, and three of the other Wild Things only have a few lines of dialogue (heck, one has two sentences at the very end). I totally respect Maurice Sendak and Spike Jonze for going with this for the movie version of the book, but I don't like it. I bought it mostly because I felt bad for the movie not doing too hot in theaters, but you'll want to rent this one first. Especially if you're considering leaving your children with it on the tv while you go off and do something else. You might give them boring nightmares.

1201408,A2JTD6D79HNA5X,B001HN699A,"A. Szarka ""Russo Alexander""","[1, 5]","Where the wild Things Are is sort of depressing. Most of the film has a gloomy atmosphere. It's not really for kids, thats for sure. I read the book long ago but I recall it being more up-lifting than the movie.

However, I did squeeze in enough time to read the ten sentence children's book prior to seeing this Spike Jonze adaptation. Jonze's version is much darker in my opinion, but it really explores the depths of the mind of a pre-adolescent, lonely, scared, imaginative, and introverted young boy named Max. We see the problems in Max's real life then we spend the remainder of the film watching Max explore different aspects of himself that manifest in the form of monsters or ""wild things"" on a magical island he travels to by boat.The cinematography and art direction are wonderful and make this a fun film to watch even as Max explores painful aspects of his life. However, the film's main flaw is perhaps it captures Max too well. Max is nine, and like most nine-year-olds he is prone to irrational thinking and sudden mood shifts. Since the film follows Max it also follows his moods, and this makes for some frustratingly languid scenes. The ending suffers from this especially as Max's great realization for why he needs to return ""home"" is only inches away from, ""I'm bored with this now. I'm done."" And essentially that's how the movie ends as well.

E Jackson,"[1, 5]","I remember 2nd grade when our entire class would go to the library, and guess which book the library teacher insisted on reading to the class each and every day?  Yup, THIS one.  This was back in 1989.  I mean, I *liked* the book and everything, but I never thought Where the Wild Things Are deserved the kind of praise it has received over the years.Now -over 20 years later- I hear about a film version of a popular childhood book being released.  This immediately perks my interest because I remember those famous childhood years and specifically our library teacher standing in front of the class and constantly reading the same book to us all the time.  I guess the rest of our class loved it- I never got the appeal myself.However, despite that, I really did want to watch the film version of Where the Wild Things Are if for no other reason than to finally give it another chance.Well... I no longer remember the storyline from the book, but this film is pretty darn boring and NOT at all what I expected.I expected a really adventurous storyline involving the weirdest and wildest creatures I've ever seen.  Instead, what we have here is a rather weak attempt at an adventure, and completely misses the mark in several areas.It's about a little boy who mysteriously travels to some faraway island (which, by the way, was never made clear exactly HOW he got there- he just mysteriously appears on a boat when he runs through some trees).  The boy runs outside after fighting with his mom over the mothers new boyfriend, and BAM- the boy is located on some faraway island.  Weird.Upon getting there, the boy comes across a bunch of the SCARIEST looking creatures I have honestly ever seen.  They're scary in the same way clowns are scary, seriously.  Maybe this is why I was never a big fan of the book!  If you believe your child is easily terrified of scary looking monster creatures, I highly recommend skipping this movie and going with something else instead.Instead of an adventure taking place however, the entire film is about the little boy -along with all the island creatures- having *strong* and *frequent* emotional problems.  Yes that's right- besides a few explosions here and there, and a rock throwing game that the friendly creatures play later on, this film is completely focused on the little boys troubled and confused feelings dealing with the world.The kid apparently doesn't have a sense of humor and takes everything in life too seriously, and the monsters are the same exact (annoying) way, so the boy feels like he has a group of people he can relate to.  They TOO start whining and having lengthy, unnecessary conversations amongst themselves concerning the little boy and whether he should be king of the island or whatever.There are so many useless talking segments, and the storyline development is so dry that I have no choice but to declare that the film version of Where the Wild Things Are is a major disappointment.  The advertisements claimed it would be a great family movie- it's anything but.Skip it, unless you actually care how these land monsters communicate with each other and maintain a friendship with the little boy?  Because that's the ONLY thing that really occurs (besides the rock throwing game and the explosions I mention above).  I say avoid it.

1201416,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001HN699A,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[46, 66]","WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE is a kids movie that isn't for kids. Let me explain...The short, children's story that this film is based on (written by Maurice Sendak) has been a favorite of many kids. Note, however, that most of those children are now grown adults with fond memories of the book. I can remember reading it myself about ten dozen times when I was growing up, so I have just as fond of memories as the next person. But this movie isn't for modern-day kids. And this is where much of the confusion will lay for those who decide to take their preteens to see it.The message of this film is deep. VERY deep. In fact, most kids (and probably some adults) will have difficulties capturing it. This is probably why Warner Brothers Studios had such a big problem with director Spike Jonze's final cut. It isn't a family movie, but the book most definitely is. This is a movie about the angst of growing up and into teen-hood. This lonely journey is often rife with internal turmoil, a dash of Oedipus complex, and the releasing of deep-seeded childhood emotions, and all of this is shown on some level via the artistic tapestry that is this movie. And it is done very well in the artistic department.Little known actor Max Records plays Max, this boy who's vivid imagination allows the rumpus to begin. Running away from his mother after a bitter argument (and a biting one), Max flees to his imaginary world Where The Wild Things Are. This analogy is taken to extremes as we see all of Max's emotions doled out by the Wild Creatures he's created. The most recognizable will be Carol (voiced by James Gandolfini) as Max's angry and self-indulgent alter-ego. He tears down anything he doesn't like anymore, and this is precisely how the young Max feels about the real world he's left behind. KW (voiced by Lauren Ambrose) is the Oedipus portion of Max, and much can be gleaned from this when we see KW carry in two owl friends who Max only hears squawking (indicating he doesn't understand his mother's friends). The other Wild Things are in various stages of redirection as Max tries to work through his rough emotional state. Should he remain King of this Wild Place or return to become a budding teenager with real-world responsibilities?Again, the message isn't in-your-face -- which isn't necessarily a bad thing -- but it's also very far removed from what most movie-goers will think of as a ""kids film."" Again, not necessarily a bad thing but, parents, be prepared to answer some tough questions about what the movie was supposed to be about. This isn't some insipidly, force-it-down-your-throat message, which is refreshing, but the message is so far down the rabbit-hole that you might not be able to explain it adequately to the younger amongst your family. Just something to be mindful of.The movie is loaded with violence, including ripping trees apart, thumping heads with dirt clods, and the yanking off of a monster's extremity. Be forewarned.Like I said, this is a kids movie that isn't for kids. It's for those kids who are now grown up and have fond memories of the book. So if you're a parent who saw the cuddly looking beasts and the young Max chatting with them, and thought that this would be a good matinee to take the kiddies to ...think again.Even so, the artistry of the film was absolutely astounding. It's also quite a sad film (some people were sniffling next to me in the theater). The darkness of the Wild World was initially foreboding but eventually comes to life as Max interacts with his internal creatures. The fort they build is something to make the mouth drop, and the desert scenes were flat-out gorgeous. Which is why I enjoyed it so much.

Although I don't really remember it too much now I was excited to hear that it was being adapted to a film. I thought to myself that It would be an extremely hard task to turn the short story into a 100 minute film but maybe it could work. Wrong! From the very opening sequence I was annoyed by Max's character because he comes off too obnoxious and very selfish. But the major problem I have with this flick is that it's just plain boring. Visuals are well done and the fuzzy monsters are right on point as far as looks wise. I understand that this movie is aimed more for kids but doesn't mean adults can't enjoy either it's just that it doesn't work for me. As for the message in this film, it's pretty simple and I get it. I just have a problem with the execution. Max has issues and acts out in anger to the point where he is out of control but doesn't know that he's doing wrong.

Not one of the characters is likeable.The story is about a kid with serious emotional problems, who runs away, and befriends a bunch of monsters with similar problems. The opening 20 minutes could have been the opening to Hanible 5, or Halloween to show how the killer was unstable even as a child.I hated the kid from the first 30 seconds when he chases, tackles, and bites the poor little family dog. Then trashes his sister room because he's mad, then attacks his mom and runs away. The movie drags on like a half dead road kill for the rest of the film.If you want to see a good, fun film with monsters and imagination, then see Spiderwick, if you want to watch and equally depressing (but actually well written) film, then watch Bridge to Terabithia.  This movie needs a Doctor sitting next to you to explain the characters. I hate art that needs explaining to have worth, like a painter that throws a bunch of wavy lines on a canvas, then spend 15 minutes telling you about the chaos within humanity.Do not waste you time with this.

1201420,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B001HN699A,Brian E. Erland,"[2, 4]","I'm more than just a little surprised to see that 'Where the Wild Things Are' (2009 release) has achieved only a -3 Star- rating from the 284 reviewers making their opinions known. The main complaint seems to be that the film is too dark for young children thus making it inappropriate viewing for its assumed target audience. I understand where they're coming from, yes it's rather dark and it may not be quite what a young fan of the book might be expecting. However if the filmmakers stuck solely with the material available in the book you'd have about a ten minute featurette to watch.Again, as far as the mediocre rating goes I have to say that this is not a -3 Star- film. I found it to be imaginative, creative, witty and ultimately profoundly poignant. I applaud the makers of 'Where the Wild Things Are' for taking a chance and exploring the land of fuzzy monsters with a depth and nuance that apparently no one expected and where obviously unprepared for. Children can enjoy this film. They will understand and appreciate the aspects of the storyline geared to their level. Conversly adults will understand and appreciate aspects of the storyline geared to their level and everyone will find something to enjoy and think about.

1201422,ALC3LG8YTNHU3,B001HN699A,"Bruce Barker ""Risingsnow""","[4, 6]","Let me get to the positives first.Somewhere, Jim Henson is looking at this project and smiling with the knowledge that those who are carrying on in his name have not failed him. The creatures in this film, slightly reminiscent of Henson's homage to Brian Froud in the movie The Dark Crystal, are phenomenal. Are they costumes? Are they digital? Are they a mixture of both? The creatures are so perfectly designed that within moments you'll give up trying to figure it out and just enjoy them for what they are. The movie is chock full of small and surprising actions and activities that are both unexpected and well executed. An example of this is the great dirt clod fight in which one of the dirt bombs turns out to be an animal that someone decided to throw.The young actor playing Max is quite a find. It isn't easy for a child to carry a role with little redeeming value, but he pulls it off skillfully. The Max character is a brat with no understanding that there are consequences for his actions. Any time he gets into trouble, causes someone pain, or does something wrong, he uses his vivid imagination to lie his way out of things. When he is unable to get away with his behavior in the real world he runs away to a land populated by creatures that are naive enough to fall for his stories... at least for a while. If there is a moral lesson to be found in the story it's that the more creative your lies become, the more difficult they become to maintain. I will leave it to the viewer to decide whether the end result is that it will teach your child not to lie or merely teach them to lie with greater efficiency.Ultimately, that is where the film fails. Every adult knows that children try everything. They will try lying, sincere confession, and anything else from biting to bullying in an attempt to get their way. That's why they have parents in their lives - to guide them and teach them the socially appropriate ways to deal with the things they face in life. Children pick up an array of manipulation skills and don't hesitate to use them. Max is no different. But at no time does his mother give Max anything... well, parental. She does send him to bed without supper, but that only increases his bitterness toward her. When he acts out against her, yelling and screaming and ultimately biting her, she appears powerless to deal with him in any constructive way. He is ""punished"" for his acting out and for running away with a big slice of cake!During his time in the fantasy land (the vast bulk of the film) the creatures he interacts with behave like children themselves but often times the things they say and do aren't so much childlike as random and confusing. Jealousy rules their decision making and violence is the chief means of resolving disagreement. If something is too troublesome, they simply rip it apart and eat it. The first encounter that Max has with these creatures is in fact, when one of them is having a temper tantrum and destroying the homes of all the others. Again, the evidence that Max is completely bereft of the capacity to evaluate his environment is immediate. Rather than observe and learn what is happening, Max just joins in the destructive behavior.The best way I can put it all together is to say that the film is visually stunning - especially in HD Blu-Ray. Although the film is awash in earth tones, the colors are crisp and there is very little artifact or ""noise"" to be found in the presentation. Likewise, the music, although light and simple, comes across as clear and textured in a way that truly adds to the pleasure of watching the movie. Once you get past the effects and the almost perfect digital transfer however, the movie itself is surprisingly murky and muddled. Blu Ray can vastly improve a viewing experience but it can't help with resolving a bad script. I think small children can deal with frightening-looking monsters that turn out to be friendly. I don't think small children will follow the peculiar mood swings and confusing behavior that results in random violence.Although there is minimal blood in the film, dismemberment is still shocking - even if the victim of the violence stands there afterward and says calmly, ""that was my favorite arm, too.""Spike Jonze has created a feast for the eyes and a truly stunning collection of special effects. Unfortunately, I think he was reaching for real depth in the story as well. On that level he failed in almost every way. He has created a world that may be a bit disturbing for the very young, a bit boring and confusing for older children, and with poor moral examples that will make adults question the value off allowing their children to watch it in the first place. It isn't necessary to beat children over the head with a moral message. They are intelligent enough to grasp subtlety. The subtle moral messages in Where the Wild Things Are though, are universally negative. I'm simply unable to recommend this movie for any age group that might be interested in watching.",2,Visually stunning but any resolution is strictly visual (HD BLU RAY REVIEW),1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,5008,"['Let', 'get', 'positives', 'first.Somewhere', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'looking', 'project', 'smiling', 'knowledge', 'who', 'are', 'carrying', 'name', 'have', 'not', 'failed', 'creatures', 'film', 'slightly', 'reminiscent', 'Henson', 'homage', 'Brian', 'Froud', 'movie', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'Are', 'costumes', 'Are', 'digital', 'Are', 'mixture', 'creatures', 'are', 'so', 'perfectly', 'designed', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'give', 'up', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'enjoy', 'what', 'are', 'movie', 'chock', 'full', 'small', 'surprising', 'actions', 'activities', 'are', 'unexpected', 'well', 'executed', 'example', 'great', 'dirt', 'clod', 'fight', 'one', 'dirt', 'bombs', 'out', 'be', 'animal', 'someone', 'decided', 'throw.The', 'young', 'actor', 'playing', 'Max', 'quite', 'find', ""n't"", 'easy', 'child', 'carry', 'role', 'little', 'redeeming', 'value', 'off', 'skillfully', 'Max', 'character', 'brat', 'understanding', 'are', 'consequences', 'actions', 'time', 'trouble', 'someone', 'pain', 'something', 'wrong', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'lie', 'way', 'things', 'When', 'unable', 'get', 'away', 'behavior', 'real', 'world', 'away', 'land', 'populated', 'creatures', 'are', 'naive', 'enough', 'fall', 'stories', 'least', 'while', 'moral', 'lesson', 'be', 'found', 'story', 'more', 'creative', 'lies', 'become', 'more', 'difficult', 'become', 'maintain', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'decide', 'end', 'result', 'will', 'teach', 'child', 'not', 'lie', 'merely', 'teach', 'lie', 'greater', 'efficiency.Ultimately', 'where', 'film', 'fails', 'adult', 'children', 'try', 'everything', 'will', 'try', 'lying', 'sincere', 'confession', 'anything', 'else', 'biting', 'bullying', 'attempt', 'get', 'way', 'why', 'have', 'parents', 'lives', 'guide', 'teach', 'socially', 'appropriate', 'ways', 'deal', 'things', 'face', 'life', 'Children', 'pick', 'up', 'array', 'manipulation', 'skills', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'use', 'Max', 'different', 'time', 'mother', 'give', 'Max', 'anything', 'well', 'parental', 'send', 'bed', 'supper', 'only', 'bitterness', 'When', 'out', 'yelling', 'screaming', 'ultimately', 'biting', 'powerless', 'deal', 'constructive', 'way', 'punished', 'acting', 'out', 'running', 'away', 'big', 'slice', 'cake', 'time', 'fantasy', 'land', 'vast', 'bulk', 'film', 'creatures', 'behave', 'children', 'often', 'things', 'say', 'do', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'childlike', 'random', 'confusing', 'Jealousy', 'rules', 'decision', 'making', 'violence', 'chief', 'means', 'resolving', 'disagreement', 'something', 'too', 'troublesome', 'simply', 'rip', 'apart', 'eat', 'first', 'encounter', 'Max', 'creatures', 'fact', 'when', 'one', 'having', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'destroying', 'homes', 'others', 'Again', 'evidence', 'Max', 'completely', 'bereft', 'capacity', 'evaluate', 'environment', 'immediate', 'Rather', 'observe', 'learn', 'what', 'happening', 'Max', 'just', 'destructive', 'behavior.The', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'say', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'especially', 'HD', 'Blu-Ray', 'film', 'awash', 'earth', 'tones', 'colors', 'are', 'crisp', 'very', 'little', 'artifact', 'noise', 'be', 'found', 'presentation', 'Likewise', 'music', 'light', 'simple', 'clear', 'textured', 'way', 'truly', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'movie', 'Once', 'get', 'effects', 'almost', 'perfect', 'digital', 'transfer', 'however', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'murky', 'muddled', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'can', 'vastly', 'improve', 'viewing', 'experience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'resolving', 'bad', 'script', 'think', 'small', 'children', 'can', 'deal', 'frightening-looking', 'monsters', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'friendly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'small', 'children', 'will', 'follow', 'peculiar', 'mood', 'swings', 'confusing', 'behavior', 'results', 'random', 'minimal', 'blood', 'film', 'dismemberment', 'still', 'shocking', 'even', 'victim', 'violence', 'there', 'afterward', 'calmly', 'was', 'favorite', 'arm', 'too', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'created', 'feast', 'eyes', 'truly', 'stunning', 'collection', 'special', 'effects', 'Unfortunately', 'think', 'was', 'reaching', 'real', 'depth', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'level', 'failed', 'almost', 'way', 'created', 'world', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'very', 'young', 'bit', 'boring', 'confusing', 'older', 'children', 'poor', 'moral', 'examples', 'will', 'make', 'adults', 'question', 'value', 'allowing', 'children', 'watch', 'first', 'place', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'beat', 'children', 'head', 'moral', 'message', 'are', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'grasp', 'subtlety', 'subtle', 'moral', 'messages', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'are', 'universally', 'negative', ""'m"", 'simply', 'unable', 'recommend', 'movie', 'age', 'group', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'watching']",Where the Wild Things Are

He sets sail and washes up on an island inhabited by furry beings who take him in and crown him as their new king- unfortunately they have eaten every other king they have ever had. The boys relationship with the wild things is loving but often strained at times. He finds in them what he found back at home- love, jealousy, rivalry, acceptance...Let me say that this film looks stunning. The voice acting is brilliant, the writing and directing are sublime and the pace of the movie is measured, but perfectly so. I think the reason that people are slamming this movie is because they are approaching it a kids film, which it isn't. It is an adult film about being a kid, and how hard it could be and how we would often find comfort in make-believe.In my opinion, this is one of the most affecting films I have seen in years. Complex in so many ways- I am sure that this movie will reveal itself more as you revisit it. Don't go in expecting a fast-paced kiddies adventure movie, but instead look at the previous work of the brilliant Spike Jonze to see how he has grown as a film-maker and yet lost nothing of what made him so great in the firt place.

1201425,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B001HN699A,buru buru piggu,"[2, 5]","I saw this in IMAX and was disappointed. Spike Jonze took a simple and beloved children's book and turned it into a long, adult-themed character study filled with cynical, chronically-depressed, bickering monsters. This version of ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is definitely not suitable for kids.Firstly, it changes the story from Max being sent to his room where he conjures up an imaginary land filled with beasts to Max running away from home, getting onto a boat and sailing out to sea. In the book, all this happens in his imagination and the creatures are a manifestation of his mind. In the film, he physically runs away to a fantastical island where he encounters the frightening monsters. Secondly, the beasts are not cute at all. In fact, I hated all of them because they were a bunch of annoying, self-centered, chemically-imbalanced and violent jerks, perpetually arguing and destroying things. They had adult voices and adult mood disorders, yet children's personalities and temper tantrums. I had no expectations about how the beasts would sound, but I did not expect them to speak in full English sentences with unprocessed human adult voices. Whereas they were lovable, beast-like, and almost entirely silent in the book, they wouldn't keep their mouths shut in the film. The book (andfamous 1988 animated adaptation) was one of a mood of jubilation and childlike innocence. Jonze's vision is dark, brooding, and at times scary.They get into a lot of fights, verbally and physically. We see them rough housing and destroying trees both in jest and in anger. One beast beans two owl characters flying overhead with rocks. We see a very violent dirt clod fight suggested by Max, and as they say, it's all fun and games until someone gets hurt. This is exactly what happens to Alexander (the goat), who gets clocked in the head with a dirt clod and gets very upset. He then withdraws inward and says he doesn't want to play anymore, causing more bad feelings among the beasts, then anger from Carol, the gang's leader (shown on poster). He says Max was supposed to come and make everything all better. In the ensuing argument, one of the beasts gets his arm violently and unexpected ripped off. This film is classic, textbook child psychology on display and rather depressing to watch.I thought the movie dragged on and was very boring, with the only conflict on the island being the interbestial relationship problems between the beasts and Max, jealousy, and their collective desire for happiness and need for a feeling of security. Visually, the costumes, CGI, set design, and animatronics are top notch and spectacular. There is no arguing the level of attention, artistry and craftsmanship that went into making this film and bringing Maurice Sendak's creations to life, but that doesn't excuse what I felt was a slow, plodding narrative. I enjoyed the soundtrack (provided by Karen O. of theYeah Yeah Yeahsand film industry veteran Carter Burwell), but rate the movie experience as average on the whole. I wanted to like this film a lot, but I just couldn't get past the annoying arguing monsters. I had plenty of this growing up with parents arguing incessantly and didn't want to relive it onscreen.Definitely not one for the little ones, despite the cute-ish posters and juvenile literary origin, so be forewarned.

1201427,A11SPSEM08VIXX,B001HN699A,"Carbonadam ""Ladies and gentleman, I hope that...","[3, 10]","Where the Wild Things Are the book is a simple story about a wild boy who misbehaves, is sent to his room without dinner and then imagines a voyage to a land inhabited by wild things. It's so simple you almost wonder why it is that that book has lingered so with parents who bought it for their kids. Those kids themselves who have now grown up and had kids of our own and in turn have given the book to them all love the book too. To me the secret of the books success is the simple story, sparse in nature that speaks to us all. Still, for picture books the words are like a clothesline that the art hangs on. The art in the book is filled with mythical creatures that seem cobbled together from animals we know but still look unfamiliar. It is the art and words together that have kept this book close to all of our hearts for what is now going on it's second and third generation in families that love it. In the art and words we see something familiar but perhaps we do not know what it is. We sense rebellion, chaos, fun, anxiety, longing, redemption, and ultimately the comforts of home and family.Film is very different from books. Film requires that we are passive and sit back and experience a story that we will be told and shown. We do not control a films pace as we can with a book. Especially in a theater we must sit back and settle in for what we are about to be shown. The conversion of novels to film often times annoys people because we each see a novel in our own minds in our own special way. We have each manufactured a kind of ""film"" of what we see, feel, and how it speaks to us. Converting books to film requires great care to satisfy a broad swath of people, especially when the source material is so beloved.Now with graphic novels and picture books the images are laid out for us and the story is told. This is far closer to film and the creators have told and shown us the story. In the case of the book Where the Wild Things Are it is so short it would seem converting it to film could yield nothing more than a short at best. Film has become the great art of our time. It's our theater, combining motion photography, narrative, sound, and music all together into a complete whole. How then can such a short book be converted to a feature length film? Spike Jones knows the secret.  Rather than blindly copy the book to screen he has taken basics of what made the book great and beloved, distilled that down to it's essence and then built up upon that.The book is for kids. But kids live in an adult word and the book speaks to adults too. My parents saw something in the book that spoke to them so they got it for their kids. So the book is for adults and kids. The book as an adult means different things to me than it did as a child. As a boy I could not explain why I liked it. I just did. As an adult it is easier to put into words. To me now, the book communicates the confusing way that childhood can be, the mistakes one can make, the often harsh discipline parents are forced to dole out to the children they so dearly love and how through pure imagination a child can help save themselves and grow. It is about the relationship of the child's world to the adult's world. The book, though specific in story, is about every parent and child. It's also about how kids can experience the world in such a fantastical way. There can be, and is, a lot more to what I feel about the short book by Maurice Sendak. This is because the book does not explain itself. It just is what it is.The film Spike Jones has made is much the same. It does not explain itself. It just is what it is. A two-hour film must be more sophisticated than a short picture book than can be read in a few minutes. Still the story is pretty much the same. Max gets in trouble, Max gets disciplined, Max goes to wild thing island, and chaos and rumpus occur, Max eventually goes home to loving mom, the end. Huh? What? There is more to the film than that. Spike Jones has thankfully filled the film with symbolism and metaphor and explained little, leaving the film fully open to vast interpretation. I can only hope that this is part of a new trend with films, for the films that tell a simple tale such as this one while using metaphor to allude to more universal truths, can become a beloved film for generations, just as the book did.For me, the film was about many things, but all the while it is from a child's perspective. Max is an average boy. Not a terrible kid, just a bit lost in an adult world. He has no father figure in the film. It's not explained where or why the father is gone. This is good. This way everyone seeing the film can put their own individual ideas over this and shape it to suit them. Max is lonely, creative, and as most kids do, (and most adults too) he longs for adventure. His mother is busy as is his older sister. Both are trying to get relationships of their own with their peers up and running and have little time for Max. Over a rather minor thing such as frozen corn Max has a tantrum. He has feelings that he cannot control, or explain. The world to him is a place where rivalries for people's affections occur, and huge forces such as the sun eventually exploding are all communicated to him, and not in ways that he can easily understand. So after being smothered in his ice cave, ignored by his family, scared by his teacher, and then forced to eat frozen corn, max flips out. First he flips out in private in his sister's room. He soaks the place with ice water and then destroys a simple creation he had made for her. He then has a moment of regret about his destruction and behavior. Later in a simple animal moment he bites his mom. Biting is something animals do, and babies who do not know any better. Sophisticated humans do not bite. So then his mother reprimands Max but before he is sent to his room like in the book, Max runs away. This is just a simple switch away from the book. Converting the room via computer technology to a forest may have been the obvious choice but the essence of what occurs with Max in the book is that he escapes his reality for another. The essence of this has been preserved. And I think in an effort to have some kind of continuity he escapes the same way he returns, by boat. The journey he takes is that of the mind.So what happens in the majority of the film, which takes place with the wild things on their island? Just as in the book Max finds them and becomes their king. Here though the film gets more complicated. Each and every wild thing has a name, personality, and are interconnected or disconnected to each other in different ways. To me these wild things most likely represent adults or the adult world that Max is alienated from in the real world. They could also represent different aspects of Max's own personality. Either way he sees them the way a child does. They are often confusing, and make little sense with their complex emotions and inter-competitiveness. In this world Max's lack of understanding matters little and with a simple childlike explanation about his powers, totally lacking of any real logic, he is made king. When he is given his crown and scepter we see human bones amid glowing embers from a fire that has gone out. I suspect these bones represent other children that have similar experiences. Perhaps they represent the end of childhood into adulthood. They could also represent Max's darkest fears. What ever they represent we are not explained it and the wild things say little so this is open to interpretation. I like that lack of explanation because it makes me think about the film.The wild rumpus starts and all seems well. Although danger is often very close as when Max almost gets squashed by a falling tree, the danger is unseen by the wild things or Max as anything truly threatening. Children are like this. They do not live as cautiously as adults do because they do not have the experience we do. This wild world populated by wild things becomes Max's temporary home. We all know the book and we know he is going to go home eventually. Still, he behaves as if he is there indefinitely, and we forget for a time that he will eventually leave. Max becomes close with Carol and learns that he has a secret place he goes to create. Once there, Max sees a grand model of in ideal world for Carol. Max likes this and they eventually try and make the model a reality. In the end they just wind up making a larger version of the tiny huts the wild things were destroying when he got there. The individual huts may represent our own personal ideas, spaces, personalities and minds. The larger one they all build is more representative of a collective goal. None of us live in vacuum. Each and every one of us must exist on this world with others. We must augment our personal ideas about life to suit those around use we cherish and love, as they too must do for us. Eventually things do not go well. Max starts a war, takes sides, picks favorites, and Alexander gets hurt. Another kind of emotional chaos takes place here. This is not the fun rumpus chaos of childhood but rather more representative of the petty complex emotional disagreements that take place in families, amongst friends, and on a larger stage in the world and with countries. Spike Jones does not come out and say any of this. It's all alluded to. And all the while it is told from the often-confused perspective of a child observing but not entirely understand what it is that is playing out before them. Max does his best to cope with the wild things and make all right but it is not enough.Finally Carol has a meltdown, like Max did earlier, but this time Douglas looses an arm. It's serious. We all know it's serious, but the characters treat it as if Douglas lost a possession, not a body part. A stick is used to replace the arm. I feel this band-aid stick for an arm replacement shows that the Wild things represent complex adult facades.  Max also hides inside the wild thing KW's stomach. This is a wonderful and beautiful scene. Max is protected in the womb like innards of one of the more passive wild things. There is another small animal down there, a raccoon if I remember correctly. It's not a place of death and digestion but rather a sanctuary. He and KW speak to one another while he is in there. KW protects Max from the now raging Carol. This can be interpreted many ways but surely the poignant scene has a mother/birthing aspect to it. Max finally says he is having trouble breathing, just like when a baby is born, before they take their first real breath. Max finally emerges from KW, wet, slimy, and disgusting, just like a baby has been born.Growing tired of the chaos and also longing for home and food, Max decides to leave the wild things. Carol, who was mad earlier, finds Max's heart note made of sticks at the center of his destroyed model of a perfect world. Having second thoughts about his anger, as parents often do, Carol runs to Max to say goodbye. Not finding the words, Carol starts to howl. Eventually, all the wild things howl goodbye to Max and he howls back. Max is growing up, and he is also leaving something behind.  Max goes home to find his mother waiting with warm dinner. There is an understanding that has taken place without using words to muck it up, a connection between child and parent, between childhood and adulthood.Is there more? Sure there is. The film is a vast trove of metaphor, symbolism, and mythology layered over the simple story we all love.  It is not simply just a story for kids and that's it. Kids I suspect will enjoy it, but there is more to it to which can be sifted and mined for countless future viewings. I feel the film is open to interpretation, just like the book. My 8-year-old son enjoyed it greatly, but I know he did not get out of it all that I did. It's a film, like the book, that says more than is just told on the surface. Everything that occurs on the island can be seen as metaphorical or symbolic for more complex adult relationships, facades, worldly issues, and more. All the complexities the film alludes to are as seen as through a child's perspective. The film does not neatly explain itself but is open to interpretation. All my favorite films are like this. I could go on and on. It was a masterpiece.",5,"Where the  metaphor, symbolism, and mythology are!",1255737600,"10 17, 2009",2009,12316,"['Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'book', 'simple', 'story', 'wild', 'boy', 'who',

1201432,AN9J46667D80O,B001HN699A,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[7, 10]","Being a child sucks.As adults we talk about how wonderful childhood was and use phrases like, ""In the halcyon days of my youth..."" Well, most of us don't use THAT phrase, but you get the idea. We idealize childhood as a time of innocence, delight and joy. We refer nostalgically to our early years as ""The best years of my life.""We do this and ignore the reality of childhood. We ignore the memories of terror and sadness, the years spent not really understanding anything about the larger world, the feeling of oppression by adults, by school bullies, by our siblings. We forget the times we felt like the world never understood us and how we'd wished - oh, how we'd hoped - that it would all go away and we'd end up being the long-lost child of someone rich and famous who would take us away from the horrible world we were in and to some greater, more wonderful place.For most of us the best we could ever do to get that better place was to imagine it. That's what young Max does in this wonderful adaptation of Maurice Sendak's classic children's book, ""Where the Wild Things Are"".Like most people born after about 1960 or so I read the book when I was a kid, and had a copy of it. I remember reading the heck out of it, and I even remember being excited every year at Christmas when there was a chance (cause it didn't happen every Christmas, just a few), of going to see the Pacific Northwest Ballet do their performance of ""The Nutcracker"", because it contained sets designed by Sendak.The movie stretches the original story somewhat (it had to, given that the book was about ten sentences in length), but unlike other movie adaptations of short kids books (most notoriously ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and ""The Cat in the Hat""), this adaptation succeeds.The movie tells the story of young Max, a lonely nine-year-old boy with a very active imagination. He's prone to great fits of creativity, occasional bouts of violence and crying for what he knows isn't a good reason. He's at that most awkward of ages: still a child, but he can see puberty coming over the horizon. He's not a little kid anymore, but he's not nearly an adult.He gets into a fight with his mother one night while wearing a wolf costume. It ends with him biting her shoulder and running into the night. He wanders along through the darkened backways of suburban America and eventually finds a little boat. He gets inside and winds up where the wild things are. He's initially scared of them, but then spins them a tale of great BS and winds up being made their king.Let the wild rumpus start!This movie is charming on many levels. Max Records, who plays the main character Max, is thoroughly adorable. The monsters, most notably Carrol and KW, are entertaining and charismatic, particularly Carrol, voiced by James Gandolfini. He really does a great job of reflecting all the insecurity and uncertainty that the character of Max feels.Visually the movie is wonderful to look at. During one point in the story Max comes up with the idea of building a great big fort for them all to live in, and the end product looks spectacular. And the wild things themselves are a major technological accomplishment. Played by actors in suits with CGI added in, they look and feel real.The writing is quite sharp, and at no point does this feel like a ten sentence story stretched into 100 minutes. It feels more like it derived organically and is an extension of the original story rather than stuff just added in recently. It works and works well.Lots of people have said this isn't a movie for kids, and I totally disagree. Really young kids, like four or five years old, they won't likely get it and will be bored and fidgetty. But kids from about eight or so upward should be able to handle it fine.This is, by the way, the first movie I've ever seen in Blu Ray! It looks great, but since I haven't seen any others, I can't really compare as far as picture quality or anything like that goes. The special features are wonderful fun, particularly the ones show Max Records and his family. He seems to have a good head on his shoulders, and a good family backing him up. I see good things for him in the future.Now I just wait to see if they'll try an adaptation of ""In the Night Kitchen""...",5,"Wonderful, sad, happy, terrifying, uncertain and joyful... just like being a kid.",1269648000,"03 27, 2010",2010,4261,"['Being', 'child', 'sucks.As', 'talk', 'how', 'wonderful', 'childhood', 'was', 'use', 'phrases', 'halcyon', 'days', 'youth', 'Well', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'phrase', 'get', 'idea', 'idealize', 'childhood', 'time', 'innocence', 'delight', 'joy', 'refer', 'nostalgically', 'early', 'years', 'best', 'years', 'life', 'do', 'ignore', 'reality', 'childhood', 'ignore', 'memories', 'terror', 'sadness', 'years', 'spent', 'not', 'really', 'understanding', 'anything', 'larger', 'world', 'feeling', 'oppression', 'adults', 'school', 'bullies', 'siblings', 'forget', 'times', 'felt', 'world', 'never', 'understood', 'how', ""'d"", 'wished', 'oh', 'how', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'would', 'go', 'away', ""'d"", 'end', 'up', 'being', 'long-lost', 'child', 'someone', 'rich', 'famous', 'who', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'horrible', 'world', 'were', 'greater', 'more', 'wonderful', 'place.For', 'most', 'best', 'could', 'ever', 'do', 'get', 'better', 'place', 'was', 'imagine', 'what', 'young', 'Max', 'wonderful', 'adaptation', 'Maurice', 'Sendak', 'classic', 'children', 'book', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'most', 'people', 'born', '1960', 'so', 'read', 'book', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'had', 'copy', 'remember', 'reading', 'heck', 'even', 'remember', 'being', 'excited', 'year', 'Christmas', 'when', 'was', 'chance', 'cause', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Christmas', 'just', 'few', 'going', 'see', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'Ballet', 'do', 'performance', 'Nutcracker', 'contained', 'sets', 'designed', 'Sendak.The', 'movie', 'original', 'story', 'somewhat', 'had', 'given', 'book', 'was', 'about', 'ten', 'sentences', 'length', 'other', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'short', 'kids', 'books', 'most', 'notoriously', 'How', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'adaptation', 'movie', 'story', 'young', 'Max', 'lonely', 'nine-year-old', 'boy', 'very', 'active', 'imagination', 'prone', 'great', 'fits', 'creativity', 'occasional', 'bouts', 'violence', 'crying', 'what', ""n't"", 'good', 'reason', 'most', 'awkward', 'ages', 'still', 'child', 'can', 'see', 'puberty', 'coming', 'horizon', 'not', 'little', 'kid', 'anymore', 'not', 'nearly', 'adult.He', 'fight', 'mother', 'one', 'night', 'wearing', 'wolf', 'costume', 'biting', 'shoulder', 'running', 'night', 'along', 'darkened', 'backways', 'suburban', 'America', 'eventually', 'little', 'boat', 'inside', 'up', 'where', 'wild', 'things', 'are', 'initially', 'scared', 'then', 'tale', 'great', 'BS', 'up', 'being', 'made', 'king.Let', 'wild', 'rumpus', 'start', 'movie', 'charming', 'many', 'levels', 'Max', 'Records', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'Max', 'thoroughly', 'adorable', 'monsters', 'most', 'notably', 'Carrol', 'KW', 'are', 'entertaining', 'charismatic', 'particularly', 'Carrol', 'voiced', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'reflecting', 'insecurity', 'uncertainty', 'character', 'Max', 'feels.Visually', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'look', 'one', 'point', 'story', 'Max', 'up', 'idea', 'building', 'great', 'big', 'fort', 'live', 'end', 'product', 'spectacular', 'wild', 'things', 'are', 'major', 'technological', 'accomplishment', 'Played', 'actors', 'suits', 'CGI', 'added', 'look', 'feel', 'real.The', 'writing', 'quite', 'sharp', 'point', 'feel', 'ten', 'sentence', 'story', 'stretched', '100', 'minutes', 'more', 'derived', 'organically', 'extension', 'original', 'story', 'rather', 'stuff', 'just', 'added', 'recently', 'well.Lots', 'people', 'have', 'said', ""n't"", 'movie', 'kids', 'totally', 'disagree', 'Really', 'young', 'kids', 'four', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'wo', ""n't"", 'likely', 'get', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'fidgetty', 'kids', 'eight', 'so', 'upward', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'way', 'first', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'great', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'compare', 'as', 'far', 'picture', 'quality', 'anything', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'wonderful', 'fun', 'particularly', 'ones', 'show', 'Max', 'Records', 'family', 'have', 'good', 'head', 'shoulders', 'good', 'family', 'backing', 'see', 'good', 'things', 'future.Now', 'just', 'wait', 'see', ""'ll"", 'try', 'adaptation', 'Night', 'Kitchen']",Where the Wild Things Are

1201434,A1A89LQ8C1AYV1,B001HN699A,Christopher Deweese,"[4, 8]","I love Where the Wild Things Are (the book I mean).  It was one of my favorite books as a young boy, ranking right up there with Dr. Seuss.  It's difficult to articulate what it was about that book that was so appealing, but I read it over and over again.  I perused the wonderful illustrations and was enchanted by the creative (and a little scary) monsters that somehow came to life on the pages.  When I learned that this book was to be adapted as a motion picture I squealed with delight (ok maybe I didn't squeal out loud), but then I regained my composure and started to think.  This book is not very long.  It's short on dialogue.  There really isn't much of a story.  How in the world could someone make a movie out of this?  After watching the blu-ray version, all of my fears came true.This movie is s...l...o...w.  It's boring.  I found myself wishing it would just end.  I did not care about Max.  I did not care about the monsters (voiced by James Gandolfini, Forest Whitaker, Catherine O'Hara, and others).  I actually cared more for Max's poor mother (the always great Catherine Keener) who had to withstand his ridiculous tantrums, aggression, and attention getting behaviors.  This movie should have been titled Where the Depressed Things Are.  There was very little in the way of wildness (the ""rumpus"" was boring).  The monsters were all so pathetic and down trodden that you just wanted them to go away.  Actually, it seemed that the monsters themselves just wanted to go away.  They all seemed to have a connection with each other, but that connection was filled with dysfunction and resentment.  It was not fun to watch.I started to wonder if this movie is some kind of allegory about unresolved anger.  I honestly cannot find the meaning because it feels so empty.  Perhaps that was the point, but it's hard to justify an hour and a half of emptiness to an adult, much less a child watching this.  As expected, the blu-ray version of the film looks and sounds great.  Do I care?  Not really.

Now my kids just couldn't stay and watch it the whole time since it was more emotionally building to it's climax with not much action.  When something does happen they did take notice.  My 2 year old was exicted about seeing it since he loves the books so much, but quickly became bored with it around the time they are building the fort.  My 6 year old girl watched most of it and seemed to enjoy it, but did not like many of the ""scary"" and unnerving points of the film.  When Max crawls into one of the monsters that was a bit... odd, but we did let them know he wasn't ""eaten"" she let him IN there to ""escape"" for a moment.  It was eerie-looking though... The movie was paced a bit slow, but stayed oddly enough, well with the plot and the overall premise of the short children's book.  This movie would be great with older kids or pre-teens to watch with and open up with your kids, and let them open up with their parents about personal issues.  Every one want's to have assurance, friendship and love... and as... well,  ""wild"" as this movie is, it has all three.How Max leaves the island... the book ""Max"", I had a sense of him being arrogant and somewhat still furtive, while the monsters are actually scaring him off their island!  This movie turns that around as an emotional development growth for both Max and ""his"" monsters.  My little girl did laugh a few times, and may have teared up a little when she came back to see the ending.  At one point a monster injures another, it was almost frightening until you see what comes OUT of the monster... and all I could think of was ""pinata-like""?  Then she saw the monster ""fixed"" and she just had to laugh... we all did really.  There's something here for parents and kids alike, though could be a bit too scary for the very young, and... boring, thus my 4 star review.

1201437,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B001HN699A,Craig Whittle,"[2, 5]","WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARESTARRING: Max Records, Katherine Keener, Mark Ruffalo and the voices of: James Gandolfini, Chris Cooper, Paul Dano, Catherine O'Hara, Forest Whitaker, Michael Berry Jr. and Lauren AmbroseWRITTEN BY: Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers; based on the book by Maurice SendakDIRECTED BY: Spike JonzeRated: PGGenre: Fantasy / AdventureRelease Date: 16 October 2009Having read the book Where the Wild Things Are several times as a kid, I was very interested in learning how the filmmakers were going to turn the short story which consisted of a mere nine sentences, into a feature length film. Sadly, it would have done better as a short film with nine sentences of dialogue.The film begins with the very realistic but depressing life of a boy named Max, played magnificently by Max Records. Max is a very troubled boy suffering from loneliness, among other things. He seems to yearn for his mother's (Katherine Keener) affection and when he isn't satisfied with the amount she feeds him, he lashes out in anger; throwing temper tantrums and even going so far as to biting her.If you're thinking that this doesn't exactly sound like a film you'd take the kids to, you are right. Although it is somewhat marketed as a film for children, it is definitely not, in reality. Even though The Pirates of the Caribbean movies were all rated PG - 13 and were filled with violence; this one is only rated PG and you'd be much better off with something in the field of those, trust me.I was stunned in the theater at the behavior of Max. I instantly thought of all of the unfortunate parents who would be taking their little ones to see it that weekend.And it only gets worse from there. After he yells at his mother and bites her, Max runs away. He runs so far away in fact that he comes across a boat and sails away to a magical island.Once on the island he hears loud noises in the woods and soon discovers that he is not alone. The island is inhabited by a group of large monsters who can talk and are occupied with rough housing. Max is intrigued by these creatures and so are we.The monsters were done extraordinarily well by Jim Henson's work shop. It's nice to see some people in Hollywood put some time and effort into the look of their film for a change. It makes us as movie-goers able to appreciate the artistic work, knowing that the people producing the material care what it looks like.The creatures are undoubtedly actors in large suits but their faces are a combination of makeup and CGI (computer graphic imagery) and at times its difficult to distinguish between which is which. They did a phenomenal job here. In addition to the way the creatures look, the cast of actors that bring them to life did an amazing job as well.But we all know you can't have a good movie with a horrible story that goes no-where and leaves us with too many unanswered questions. That's exactly what this film is.The movie is slow and boring and irritating and depressing all at the same time. You are visually entertained by the characters but most of them are meek and dark and have depressing issues that bog you down and make you feel uncomfortable in your seat.James Gandolfini is the voice of Carol, who I enjoyed most in the film, but that's not saying much. Carol is sort of the leader of this group of monsters. You get the feeling they must all be outcasts and loaners from a greater tribe of monsters.Upon meeting Max in the woods, he befriends him quickly and Max is invited into this weird circle of beasts. For a while Max feels at home and they all seem to enjoy having him there. They even make him their King.But then things start to get weird. The monsters all play too rough with each other and don't seam to be aware that Max is a fragile boy. They nearly smother him to death in what they call a `pile'; which consists of all of them laying on top of each other and they often sleep this way as well. Hopefully it was never intended, but this almost has an inappropriate sexual feel to it, that made me uneasy.Soon we learn that all of these creatures, just like Max, have serious issues. They all turn to him for answers and at first Max seems to offer a lot of solitude to each of them. He becomes a great leader as the King of the colony and tells them that they are going to construct a huge fortress that they will all live in together. It looked pretty cool and I think kids will enjoy this part of the film (if their parent's have allowed them to continue watching up to this point and if they weren't too frightened to keep interest on their own, that is).When Max seems to not have all of the answers however, they begin to slowly but surely turn on him. Some of them even threaten to eat him and it is very eerie. This is due largely to the amazing performances of all the actors, but it's just not right for what this movie is aimed at: KIDS.There have been family films in the past that have had dark and unhappy moments in them, but never like this. Most of the movies like that which we have all seen, usually have a lot of humor and the kids will actually pick up on an underlying message or lesson to be learned.No such ingredient is found in this film. I feel that the filmmakers may have intended to have some kind of message but at least for me, it was never fully found. I was just depressed through the entire movie and even more so at the end.Nothing seems to be resolved. Max attempts to help several of the others with their problems but never quite can. Eventually they all learn that he is not a King and is just a boy and some of them become angry with him; especially Carol who becomes very violent and upset. How did they think this would be ok for kids?Most movies have a crisis where two of the main characters have a falling out towards the end and they spend the last twenty minutes or so making everything ok again. There are some exceptions like Million Dollar Baby, Gladiator and Old Yeller, where the ending isn't exactly peachy; but the characters in those films learned valuable lessons about themselves and accomplished great feats. I'm not sure that Max really learned anything here and even more so I don't think the creatures did. Sure Max missed his mom, but did he learn anything? Are kids going to take anything positive from this film at all? The reality is, they would benefit more from watching Spongebob Squarepants.",2,Where the Wild Things Are Review,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,6385,"['WHERE', 'WILD', 'THINGS', 'ARESTARRING', 'Max',

The projects that Jonze is involved with represent the most enlightened art in American cinema today, the cutting edge in Hollywood.  One must remember that the mean age of the Friday night eight-plex going crowd is 12 or 13 years old - catering to the caprice of this crowd is the primary basis for so-called ""commercial"" success.  Thus, as public taste is ajudicated statistically at the core of the film-going audience, potential for b.o. remuneration being the primary concern of those who keep such statistics close-by, American film is designed to avoid subtlety, nuance.Where The Wild Things Are invites repeated viewings. A masterpiece of ensemble character development (the most challenging form of screenplay), the film is a bona fide philosophical commentary of the roots of numerous of the most serious problems confronting us today, sans pretense, or excessive elaboration. I found the film hysterically funny at moments (""... they're in love"", candid, and ultimately ""timely"" in the best sense.And I would like to commend the filmakers for not stooping to animation - the most dehumanizing trend in film.

1201440,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B001HN699A,DanD,"[6, 7]","Let's get one thing out of the way: This is not a film that will have your children jumping for joy.  Nor is it the book; it's an ADAPTATION of the book, one directed at adults.  It's deep and haunting, at times downright dark.  Max is an almost disturbed child; he runs away after biting his mother, finds himself on an island of monsters, and automatically feels at home.  Not exactly your normal child.Spike Jonze has crafted an elegant film that, when it isn't visually stunning, is emotionally direct.  Max Records, as Max, does an exquisite job.  The voice cast actually does voice acting (so rare these days); led by James Gandolfini, Chris Cooper, Paul Dano, Forest Whitaker, Catherine O'Hara, and Lauren Ambrose, they will amaze.  Catherine Keener is grossly underused, although her role is necessarily small; the same goes for Mark Ruffalo, who has maybe half a line.  The script, by author and occasional screenwriter Dave Eggers, hits all the right notes; yet it is the performances (physical and vocal) and the lifelike effects that will draw in viewers and hold them.This isn't a film for everyone; anyone looking for a simple good time had best move on.

1201442,A1CK4J7YRAUQ53,B001HN699A,"David Foughty ""DLF""","[6, 12]","If you don't know the story by Sendak- and to be fair it's only several pages long and its story was *loosely* used for this film- is about Max, who, not entirely pleased with his life in the real world ventures into the world of the 'Wild Things', a place where he can be king (or rather makes himself one) and tries to create a paradise with his fellow creatures. This is the main bit of what the story is ""about"", but how it's about it is a whole other matter. It's a movie children can see and hopefully adore, but it's more than that. What it's going for is childhood itself, what makes up a young guy who has little experience in the real world and can only really see things through imagination and in a prism of what the 'real world' represents.We see Max in class, for example, learning about how the sun works in relation to Earth. It's a truthful but pessimistic lecture (considering to elementary school kids no less) about how one day the sun will die, and so will all life. This is carried with Max when he ventures into the world of the Wild Things, and when he mentions this to Carol there's a perplexed response to this. ""It's so small,"" Carol says of the Sun, and while it doesn't bother him at the moment it later comes back as a bit of real inner turmoil that Carol can barely contemplate. Or anyone else for that matter. Can one really be expected as a child to understand the full scope of the sun dying out and life as everyone knows it ending? It may be billions of years away, but to a little boy it could be just around the corner.That, by the way, is one of the brilliant things about the movie - all of Max's collected experience, and who he is as a person, and what he can see and understand around him in his family and surroundings, is represented in the bunch of Wild Things. All of Max, indeed, is split among all of them: Carol, KW, Douglas, Ira, Alexander, and a particular 'quiet' Wild Thing that barely says a word, they're all Max, and yet because of their split pieces they're never fully whole either. This makes it easy, perhaps, for Max to be crowned as their king (hey, he did lead vikings after all!), and to lead Carol's dream of a fortress for them all where ""everything you would want to happen would happen."" There's magical moments experienced among them, and all of the Wild Things, thanks to the Jim Henson creature shop work, are all in front of us and live and breathe as real things in this set of 'wild' locations (woods, desert, beach, rocky coast). As soon as you can open up yourself to these being real beings, not just animatronics, the whole emotional core of the film opens up as well.But oh, it's also such an unusually, beautifully realized film. From its vivid and in-the-moment use of hand-held cinematography (and, sometimes, the stillness of looking at the creatures and Max in the backdrops), to the songs from Karen O. that are always supportive of the scenes (never the obtrusive kinds in other kids movies), to the complex relationships between all of the characters that one can see reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz, it's a piece of pop-art that lets the viewer in. Its welcoming, refreshing and kind of staggering to see someone who knows the way children think, and how we don't have to be a mixed-up little boy to identify and see ourselves in Max (and, also, how we can't fully identify with things as a child like divorce, re: Carol and KW's 'friendship').

1201443,A3D5CVFNIYQCSI,B001HN699A,David,"[5, 6]","Where the Wild Things Are is easily the most difficult to assess of all the movies I've ever reviewed. I first became aware of it in a darkened theater, watching pre-feature trailers with three boys aged 8 through 11. I was intrigued by the visuals, but having never heard of the book and knowing nothing about the story, I needed some input. All three had seen the movie and said that they ""hated"" it. ""It's a baby story,"" one of the two 11-year-olds said. ""You wouldn't like it."" I took their word for it, also noting that the monsters were strange looking and the boy not especially attractive, either.Enter Netflix, a recent addition to our household. Out of idle curiosity, I watched Where the Wild Things Are and was stunned. I watched it again, and again. This film, in my opinion, is a remarkable cinematic accomplishment, and yet I'm at a loss how to place it. As others have well noted, it is deeply moving, but possibly disturbing or confusing to younger children. Older children, on the other hand, may find it boring, slow moving, even annoying, as the three boys with me apparently had. Is it more a movie for grownups? I would say yes, with this proviso: To ""get it"" you must be prepared to suspend all fear and pre-judgement, open your mind and let loose your inner child. Even then, reactions will be wildly divergent, as the reviews here illustrate. I think Spike Jonze had a tiger by the tail when he undertook to make this film. To their credit, he and all others who contributed did a first rate job in all respects, and that's the main reason I give Wild Things five stars. Personally, I will admit that the message moved me to tears, but that's just me--a reflection of the acquired emotions of my own childhood and how they've influenced me throughout my grownup years. For each individual, this will be different.I will say this: Like so many other exceptional movies that make us feel and think, our shared culture would be a little bit poorer without this one.

1201444,A11L5M4MJP00UW,B001HN699A,"David L Hutchins ""Music Lover""","[10, 24]","Who were they trying to reach with this movie?  There are a lot of movies made these days that appeal to both kids and adults and many succeed in that.  This is NOT one of them, if that's what they were trying to accomplish.  For the most part I don't see this as appealing to kids or adults.  The ""wild"" creatures were somewhat interesting at times, but sort of a cross between frightening, freaky and comic.  There are too many problems with this movie.  Bratty kid trying to get attention runs away after biting his mother, jumps in a boat and just happens upon an island with strange creatures.  He isn't the least bit curious about or afraid of these creatures who are 5 times his size and who initially want to eat him?  Give me a break.  When he leaves, again in the boat, he is able to find his way home without any problem.  How?  There is no logic to this movie.  They should leave this kind of movie to the Disney people who probably could have done a much better job with the story.  Too many holes in the story.  Nothing is resolved.  The only thing I found interesting was the music, but the music didn't seem to go with the movie. There were a couple of things in the movie that I thought were totally inappropriate for children; one was when one of the creatures knocks down two owls, mid-flight with rocks.  The creature then says, ""They like it when I do that"".  She picks up the stunned owls and puts one under each arm.  Apparently they are not injured.  In another scene one creature rips the arm off another.  While it is not too gruesome, it's a stupid, unnecessary scene.  The music and the movie were both totally weird.  This is a freaky, niche movie that probably won't do very well over time.  Not recommended to anyone.  Hard to believe that some people actually thought this was a good movie.  It could have been much better with some serious tweaking, as it had all the elements that could have made it great.  It's just that they didn't know how to put them together correctly.

1201448,A24SP9OBA2OO75,B001HN699A,D. Ferrari,"[5, 8]","I wasn't going to review this movie because I got it from Netflix and watched it the other night, but after reading some of the completely nonsensical 1 star reviews I had to post something.  While I rated it 5 stars It truly would have been 4 but I wanted to try to counteract all the 1 star reviews.This is the adaptation of Maurice Sendak's classic picture book.  It is the story of Max a 9 year old boy from a broken home who is losing his relationship with his sister and is seeing his single mother move on socially.  He feels slightly neglected and a child's natural reaction is to act out in a negative way.  He runs away and finds a boat and then sails to ""Where the Wild Things Are""What this film does is changes the ""island"" into a metaphor for Max's psyche.  Notice how each of the wild things is a representation of emotion or mentallity.  Carol is angry and aggressive, Doug is intelligent, Judith is insecure etc...  They all look to KW for balance because she is the emotional center.  The voice of reason if you will.  She comes and goes.  When things are calm and positive she is there.  When things are out of control and crazy she disappears.What director Spike Jonze does in this film is perfectly displays the inner turmoil in a child's mind.  Especially a child who isn't satisfied with his home life.  Ultimately he does grow as a character and a person and goes home to his family.This movie is an incredibly intelligent movie which is rich in symbolism and depth.  After reading over half (I admit I didn't read all 6 pages) of the 1 star reviews a couple things became apparent.  Number one was that a majority of the negative reviews were simply because they didn't understand the movie.  That is understandable as it is a very thoughtful movie.  The second thing was people were upset that they couldn't just plop their children in front of the TV for 97 minutes and have that time to themselves.  To put it bluntly they wanted this movie to be a baby-sitter.I do agree that some and actually most children most likely would not like this movie because they won't really understand it.  That alone doesn't make this a bad movie.  The film is destined to be one of the most polarizing movies of all time as well as one of the most misunderstood.  I highly recommend watching it only if you have an open mind and are ready to be intellectually stimulated.",5,Brilliantly made film.

I have always been a big fan of the book 'Where The Wild Things Are' and I was curious to see how the movie would play out. Considering the book only has a little over 300 words, I was very impressed with the way the film's embellishments enhanced the true meaning of the book. It not only captures the essence of the book, it surpasses it in every way.I would like to point out that this film will NOT appeal to everyone. It's kind of an art film, which isn't a bad thing, but it will not please the majority. I must confess that on my first trip through this bizarre world I was a little perplexed. I did ""get it"", but sometimes I'm a little leery of my own interpretations. Having always been a child or felt like one even now in my 50's, I loved the way the makers of this film were able to capture how a child feels and more importantly were able to make us feel how a child feels throughout this film.There is an uneasiness watching it as you never really know if things are going to go terribly wrong. The character's on this island of monsters are really different facets of Max's personality allowed to completely run amok. Carol filled with rage, Alexander who feels ignored, the mysterious and brooding Bull, Ira and Julia, one who needs praise and the other is insecure, Douglas the soothing inner voice and K.C. the mother figure to Max.Besides being a very deep and well written film, it also looks fantastic with it's bizarre world that these incredible creatures inhabit. I personally can't see how a kid could really enjoy this film, but after talking about this film with my buddy Andrew, he told me his very young daughter loved this film too! I guess kids are more in tune than we give them credit for? I know when I watch this film from time to time, I will always think of Andrew and his little ""muffin"" running wild on all fours on this island, better known as their living room when the wild things are fast asleep.......This one's for you Andrew!.....and a rather long review for me! :-DAs for the DVD the film looks great, but the extras on the single disc are very thin, a bummer and a pretty sad release for such a great film.",5,EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS BY A MILE!,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,2241,"['When', 'Ammie', 'friend', 'mine', 'raved', 'movie', 'knew', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'great', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'book', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'Considering', 'book', 'only', 'little', '300', 'words', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'way', 'film', 'embellishments', 'enhanced', 'true', 'meaning', 'book', 'not', 'only', 'essence', 'book', 'way.I', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'film', 'will', 'NOT', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'kind', 'art', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'will', 'not', 'please', 'majority', 'must', 'confess', 'first', 'trip', 'bizarre', 'world', 'was', 'little', 'perplexed', 'did', 'get', 'sometimes', ""'m"", 'little', 'leery', 'own', 'interpretations', 'Having', 'always', 'been', 'child', 'felt', 'one', 'even', 'now', '50', 'loved', 'way', 'makers', 'film', 'were', 'able', 'capture', 'how', 'child', 'feels', 'more', 'importantly', 'were', 'able', 'make', 'feel', 'how', 'child', 'uneasiness', 'watching', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'character', 'island', 'monsters', 'are', 'really', 'different', 'facets', 'Max', 'personality', 'allowed', 'completely', 'run', 'amok', 'Carol', 'filled', 'rage', 'Alexander', 'who', 'ignored', 'mysterious', 'brooding', 'Bull', 'Ira', 'Julia', 'one', 'who', 'praise', 'other', 'insecure', 'Douglas', 'soothing', 'inner', 'voice', 'K.C', 'mother', 'figure', 'Max.Besides', 'being', 'very', 'deep', 'well', 'written', 'film', 'also', 'fantastic', 'bizarre', 'world', 'incredible', 'creatures', 'inhabit', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'kid', 'could', 'really', 'enjoy', 'film', 'talking', 'film', 'buddy', 'Andrew', 'told', 'very', 'young', 'daughter', 'loved', 'film', 'too', 'guess', 'kids', 'are', 'more', 'tune', 'give', 'credit', 'know', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'time', 'time', 'will', 'always', 'think', 'Andrew', 'little', 'muffin', 'running', 'wild', 'fours', 'island', 'better', 'known', 'living', 'room', 'when', 'wild', 'things', 'are', 'fast', 'asleep', '.This', 'one', 'Andrew', '..and', 'rather', 'long', 'review', '-DAs', 'DVD', 'film', 'great', 'extras', 'single', 'disc', 'are', 'very', 'thin', 'bummer', 'pretty', 'sad', 'release', 'such', 'great', 'film']",Where the Wild Things Are
1201454,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B001HN699A,E. David Swan,"[2, 7]","Where the Wild Things Are has been receiving some lukewarm reviews and the main complaint seems to be a question of who the target audience is supposed to be. I went with my friend's six year old granddaughter and she was never frightened and this is a girl who had to hold my hand during some parts of Pixar's film UP. It wasn't so much frightening as emotionally intense. There is a serious amount of sophistication and maturity in the writing that will likely confound some of the younger viewers.I have to give the special effects team high marks for creating one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. It looks as if the Wild Things are a combination of costumed stuntmen, wire working and CGI for the facial movement. Although I'm quite sure that the faces were CGI and not animatronics that's not to say it was obvious as CGI. The effect was entirely convincing and the large broad faces of the Wild Things allowed them to show exaggerated emotions which rather than appearing distorted like a morph actually drew me in until the Wild Things felt like real flesh and blood creatures. The movements of the Wild Things are also impressive and they absolutely radiate power which may be one of the things that might scare children. The Wild Things are often written with the emotional maturity of a child and you can imagine the tension of an emotionally immature Wild Thing capable of punching his fist through a tree or rip through solid stone. It feels as if at any time one of the Wild Things could throw a tantrum and tear Max apart. The final thing I will say about the movies visuals is the fortress that the Wild Things build. I cannot express how spectacular it looks. People should see this movie on the big screen for that visual alone.Two things stood out for me in the writing of this movie. First was the depth and maturity of the writing which may be one of the things that throws people off who are expecting something different from a film aimed at children. The second thing that jumped out at me was how Max actually acted and spoke like a child. Max didn't say things that were startling or profound and when he made up stories on the spot it felt like how a child makes up a story rather than a high priced screenwriter pretending to be a child. The movie contains absolutely legit laugh at loud moments (an accomplishment many comedies can't claim) as well as some tear jerkers. The plot never felt like it was trying to manipulate the audience but was real and honest.Right before we went to the movie I read my friend's granddaughter the original story by Maurice Sendak which takes about 3 minutes to get through start to finish. Obviously the movie embellishes a ton but I felt like the spirit of the story was maintained and the added parts were very creative and well done. The fact that this movie has an aggregate score of 68% on Rotten Tomatoes and an absolutely cinematic train wreck like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull holds a 77% really makes me question the competency of professional reviewers. Adults with children may cringe during some of the intense scenes (and they are intense) but I would say this movie is a rousing success from a technical and artistic standpoint. I loved this film and would highly recommend it.",5,A Wild Emotional Ride,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",2009,3297,"['Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'been', 'receiving', 'lukewarm', 'reviews', 'main', 'complaint', 'be', 'question', 'who', 'target', 'audience', 'supposed', 'be', 'went', 'friend', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'granddaughter', 'was', 'never', 'frightened', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'hold', 'hand', 'parts', 'Pixar', 'film', 'UP', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'frightening', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'serious', 'amount', 'sophistication', 'maturity', 'writing', 'will', 'likely', 'confound', 'younger', 'viewers.I', 'have', 'give', 'special', 'effects', 'team', 'high', 'marks', 'creating', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'stunning', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Wild', 'Things', 'are', 'combination', 'costumed', 'stuntmen', 'wire', 'working', 'CGI', 'facial', 'movement', ""'m"", 'quite', 'sure', 'were', 'CGI', 'not', 'animatronics', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'obvious', 'CGI', 'effect', 'was', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'large', 'broad', 'Wild', 'Things', 'allowed', 'show', 'exaggerated', 'emotions', 'rather', 'appearing', 'distorted', 'morph', 'actually', 'drew', 'Wild', 'Things', 'felt', 'real', 'flesh', 'blood', 'creatures', 'movements', 'Wild', 'Things', 'are', 'also', 'impressive', 'absolutely', 'radiate', 'power', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'things', 'might', 'scare', 'children', 'Wild', 'Things', 'are', 'often', 'written', 'emotional', 'maturity', 'child', 'can', 'imagine', 'tension', 'emotionally', 'immature', 'Wild', 'Thing', 'capable', 'punching', 'fist', 'tree', 'rip', 'solid', 'stone', 'time', 'one', 'Wild', 'Things', 'could', 'throw', 'tantrum', 'tear', 'Max', 'apart', 'final', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'movies', 'visuals', 'fortress', 'Wild', 'Things', 'build', 'can', 'not', 'express', 'how', 'spectacular', 'People', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'visual', 'alone.Two', 'things', 'stood', 'out', 'writing', 'movie', 'First', 'was', 'depth', 'maturity', 'writing', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'things', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'something', 'different', 'film', 'aimed', 'children', 'second', 'thing', 'jumped', 'out', 'was', 'how', 'Max', 'actually', 'acted', 'spoke', 'child', 'Max', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'things', 'were', 'startling', 'profound', 'when', 'made', 'up', 'stories', 'spot', 'felt', 'how', 'child', 'up', 'story', 'rather', 'high', 'priced', 'screenwriter', 'pretending', 'be', 'child', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'legit', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'accomplishment', 'many', 'comedies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'claim', 'as', 'well', 'tear', 'jerkers', 'plot', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'trying', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'was', 'real', 'honest.Right', 'went', 'movie', 'read', 'friend', 'granddaughter', 'original', 'story', 'Maurice', 'Sendak', '3', 'minutes', 'get', 'start', 'finish', 'Obviously', 'movie', 'ton', 'felt', 'spirit', 'story', 'was', 'maintained', 'added', 'parts', 'were', 'very', 'creative', 'well', 'done', 'fact', 'movie', 'aggregate', 'score', '68', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'absolutely', 'cinematic', 'train', 'wreck', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Kingdom', 'Crystal', 'Skull', '77', '%', 'really', 'question', 'competency', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'Adults', 'children', 'may', 'cringe', 'intense', 'scenes', 'are', 'intense', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'rousing', 'success', 'technical', 'artistic', 'standpoint', 'loved', 'film', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend']",Where the Wild Things Are
1201455,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001HN699A,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[8, 20]","This film is a love-hate film: either the viewer will love it or hate it. My opinion, anyway.To begin with, I am a huge fan of Maurice Sendak, the author of the 12-page children's book upon which this hour-and-a-half film is based. Sendak, I know, chose Spike Jonze to execute this entire project, waiting, as I understand it, over a decade for the right fellow to come along.Sendak erred.Terry Gilliam, undoubtedly unavailable, would have been the prefect choice for this film. Jonze has what I call music video talent and not much more. As if you didn't already know, Max is a wild, rather nasty piece of work and decides to vanish. He goes Where the Wild Things Are, and I'm certain the Wild Things are parts of Max that he doesn't really perceive or understand. A bit like this film.Trouble is, this film is really and truly for children only. I found it aimless, boring, annoying with the stupid half drunken soundtrack. I saw a great deal of talent wasted. My wife, a special ed teacher, was confused to the point of being speechless except to say the film was ""too negative"". Knowing film as I do, I think she meant there was not much good about the film.We did admire the monsters and their deftly moving eyes and mouths. ""Babe"" had a lot of that too, and I found I now love talking pigs and dogs more than I ever thought possible.What lessons does Max learn? What do the monsters signify? Is there even any fun in this film? [GIGANTIC RASPBERRY TO ALL OF THE ABOVE, IS WHAT THIS FILM OFFERS. MAKE ONE ANYTIME YOU LIKE.]All I can say is I was charmed by the serious abilities of young Max Records, who is simultaneously sweet and intense. Watch this boy: he has a stellar future waiting for him in film and he's darned good in this otherwise crappy offering. And the vocal performances, in their own lazy, directionless way, were fun and at times slightly humorous. Chris Cooper always brightens any film as does Forest Whitaker. However:Generally I would advise against wasting money on this dvd. The extras are garbage, no documentary, and frankly not worth a trip anywhere to buy it or worth the shipping to order it.",2,Where the Wild Imagination AREN'T,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,2128,"['film', 'love-hate', 'film', 'viewer', 'will', 'love', 'hate', 'My', 'opinion', 'anyway.To', 'begin', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Maurice', 'Sendak', 'author', '12-page', 'children', 'book', 'hour-and-a-half', 'film', 'based', 'Sendak', 'know', 'chose', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'execute', 'entire', 'project', 'waiting', 'understand', 'decade', 'right', 'fellow', 'come', 'along.Sendak', 'erred.Terry', 'Gilliam', 'undoubtedly', 'unavailable', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'prefect', 'choice', 'film', 'Jonze', 'what', 'call', 'music', 'video', 'talent', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'Max', 'wild', 'rather', 'nasty', 'piece', 'work', 'decides', 'vanish', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', ""'m"", 'certain', 'Wild', 'Things', 'are', 'parts', 'Max', ""n't"", 'really', 'perceive', 'understand', 'bit', 'film.Trouble', 'film', 'really', 'truly', 'children', 'only', 'found', 'aimless', 'boring', 'annoying', 'stupid', 'half', 'drunken', 'soundtrack', 'saw', 'great', 'deal', 'talent', 'wasted', 'My', 'wife', 'special', 'ed', 'teacher', 'was', 'confused', 'point', 'being', 'speechless', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'negative', 'Knowing', 'film', 'do', 'think', 'meant', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'good', 'film.We', 'did', 'admire', 'monsters', 'deftly', 'moving', 'eyes', 'mouths', 'Babe', 'had', 'lot', 'too', 'found', 'now', 'love', 'talking', 'pigs', 'dogs', 'more', 'ever', 'thought', 'possible.What', 'lessons', 'Max', 'learn', 'What', 'do', 'monsters', 'signify', 'there', 'even', 'fun', 'film', 'GIGANTIC', 'RASPBERRY', 'TO', 'ALL', 'THE', 'ABOVE', 'WHAT', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'OFFERS', 'MAKE', 'ONE', 'ANYTIME', 'YOU', 'LIKE', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'charmed', 'serious', 'abilities', 'young', 'Max', 'Records', 'who', 'simultaneously', 'sweet', 'intense', 'Watch', 'boy', 'stellar', 'future', 'waiting', 'film', 'darned', 'good', 'otherwise', 'crappy', 'offering', 'vocal', 'performances', 'own', 'lazy', 'directionless', 'way', 'were', 'fun', 'times', 'slightly', 'humorous', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'always', 'film', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'However', 'Generally', 'would', 'advise', 'wasting', 'money', 'dvd', 'extras', 'are', 'garbage', 'documentary', 'frankly', 'not', 'trip', 'anywhere', 'buy', 'shipping', 'order']",Where the Wild Things Are
1201456,AA7W0CFRXF46L,B001HN699A,elfdart,"[3, 5]","i never really saw the attraction of this book when i was a child so was a bit hesitant about seeing this movie, but it was pretty good, better than the book in my opinion.the story loosely follows the book but only structurally. it leaves a lot of room for interpretation, which i think was a necessary choice to make a feature film longer than ten minutes. luckily the interpretation was well done and really drew upon feelings people have about their childhood, but i'd like to say that this is not a movie for children. first of all, the characters on the island's heads are disproportionate to their bodies, which makes the facial features larger. while i enjoy this now in an artistic sense, when i was young the exaggerated facial features creeped me out a bit, and i could for-see it intimidating small children, especially if there are large teeth and threats of being eaten. the overall tone of the movie has a threatening, uncertain sort of atmosphere, almost as if the viewer feeling like there isn't peace or that the peace won't last long. also, i don't think this is a children's film because the mess max created doesn't get resolved, he just leaves. there is unrest both when he arrives and when he leaves, but tough he tries he doesn't solve it or even clean up the mess he makes. before he leaves one of the monsters says that max is sort of insignificant, that he's too small to effect change. there's also a weird part where max climbs into kw's mouth to hide.. and these kinds of things aren't usually what you'd see in your typical children's film.as an adult film however, this movie was great. i thought that the way the movie was set up expressed an impression a person would have of their childhood when they were reminiscing about it. max is childhood personified. he has an amazing imagination and lives his life from the perspective of this imagination. everything is taken to the extreme, like when a child wants something but doesn't get it it's the end of the world, or if a child is excited about something a whole new world is possible. the story was almost dystopian because of the fact that max can't make the monsters happy. after a while he just stopped trying and went home to his mom so that he didn't have to deal with it anymore. it's almost like in peter pan where the lost boys need a mother, but there's no wendy here. max just sort of used the monsters to realize that he needed a mother because he was as lost and as afraid as they were. the film finishes with a feel good moment as max eats dinner with his mom after he comes home, and theres a sense that everything worked out and he has love, which was the problem with the monsters, they didn't have anyone loving them.though i'd be hesitant to take someone under 6 or 7 to see it, it was a good movie about a child's imagination and search for love",5,good,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,2851,"['i', 'never',

The thing I didn't like about the movie was that it got really slow after awhile, and the storyline was really boring. I understand as a child the fears we have of things, but all that war with the mud rocks was a horrible thing that didn't have a lot to do with Max or the original story.  I also was very disappointed in how they made Max get to where the ""Wild Things"" were. Why didn't he go there in his room like in the book?It just wasn't that good of an adaptation, because I got bored with all the different storylines they were trying to incorporate all at once, and it made it really boring to the point I was yawning during it.

1201459,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B001HN699A,Enjolras,"[2, 4]","I think there's a lot to be said for this movie. The monsters and setting are realistic yet have an air of fantasy about them. The story is subtle in its exploration of growing up and family politics. While kids might see it as a jaunt through a fantasy with monsters, adults will recognize personal foibles they will likely have encountered at home or in the office.Unfortunately, the movie is marred by a few bad decisions. First off, the kid Max (Max Records) is just way too aggressive and crazy at the beginning of the movie. He comes across as just spoiled and annoying - not somebody we sympathize with. On the other hand, the monsters were a bit too normal. They were ugly and had big heads, but otherwise seemed like a bunch of human kids (or maybe pre-teens). They bickered and talked constantly. Perhaps the worst scene, which others have already noted, is when one monster rips off another's arm.

1201461,A150QZUUQAN21X,B001HN699A,Fallout Girl,"[4, 13]","First of all, as many other reviewers rightly point out, this is NOT a movie for children. It takes a wonderful, lighthearted, uplifting book and turns it into something that's downright depressing. From the first scene, I was weirded out and turned off. I'm all for showing your own unique vision, but if you have to twist a book so much... Just write your own book and make it into a movie. Otherwise, what's the point? It's almost like they used the popular title hoping to draw more people into the theater. Come on now, this movie is NOTHING like the book.The book Max is mischievous and silly, which is something all kids and kids-at-heart can relate to and cheer on. But the movie Max is neither of those things. He's obnoxious and mean-spirited, I even daresay borderline sociopath. I don't have a problem with the kid who played him, nor do I think he's a bad actor. It's the way he was directed that grates on my nerves. Max disrespects his parents, he physically assaults his mom, he lies, he runs away from home for no valid reason, he throws rocks at animals... you get the point. But the worst part is that he never learns a lesson. He never says sorry. He never realizes that his actions affect the people around him. And, in the end of the movie, instead of a week-long timeout, he gets a cake! Hooray! See, kids, it's okay to be that way! Let your negative emotions out!Um, no, it's not okay. Having negative emotions and being mad at adults and the world is a normal part of growing up, but being an obnoxious, malicious brat ISN'T. Letting out your negative emotions is not the same as taking those emotions out on other people. There's a whole lot of anger and bile in this movie, but not an iota of love or compassion. I hated it with a passion, and so did my kids, aged 10 and 5. To tell the truth, I would be worried if they didn't...

1201462,A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B001HN699A,Feelah the tigress,"[4, 6]","When I rented this movie I was expecting a light-hearted children's film with some cute lovable monsters (I've never read the book so I didn't really know what to expect).  Well, this is an entirely different sort of film.  It's not a bad film--it's quite good in fact, but I felt like the trailers for it are very misleading.  They only show the moments of humor, when in reality this film is very dark and introspective.  That being said, I think this film is more for adults than children.  The main character Max is a troubled boy who doesn't understand why he isn't getting more attention from his family (like all children this age he is selfish and doesn't yet know how to keep that in check).  He runs away after a temper tantrum and falls asleep in the woods.  He then dreams of sailing away to an island inhabited by monsters.  They all seem troubled too and he agrees to be their king to try to give them some sort of happiness and cohesion.  These monsters very cleverly represent parts of Max's own psyche and his relationship to others.  He starts to see and understand his own violent behavior through the disturbing fights between the monsters.  He eventually realizes that he isn't fit or able to be king of anyone and leaves the island.  He also comes to understand that his own temper tantrums and violent behavior are hurtful and must be kept in check.  So he returns home to his mother with this new found understanding.  Even though it's a very melancholy movie I think it's a very good one in that it really has an emotional impact and deeper meaning than a simple children's film about a boy who befriends some monsters.  The soundtrack is also very good-it's has a wistful, yearning sound to it that complements the subject matter.  I've noticed that the reviews for this film are firmly split right down the middle.  I suspect that many adults going into this expecting lighthearted fare the likes of Pixar or Disney were disappointed, and that many children will not understand this film.  If reviews are any indication, many adults didn't get it either.  The very fact that this film is so provocative and deep means that it will probably end up being a cult classic later even if it doesn't do well in the box office or is panned by critics now.  Sigh, the best films usually aren't recognized until long after their theater premiers.  Well anyway, my advice to adults is to keep an open mind about this movie and to view it first and make your own judgment before letting a younger child to see it.",4,A very good film-but perhaps more for adults than children,1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,2528,"['When', 'rented', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'light-hearted', 'children', 'film', 'cute', 'lovable', 'monsters', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Well', 'entirely', 'different', 'sort', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'fact', 'felt', 'trailers', 'are', 'very', 'misleading', 'only', 'show', 'moments', 'humor', 'when', 'reality', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'introspective', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'film', 'more', 'adults', 'children', 'main', 'character', 'Max', 'troubled', 'boy', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', ""n't"", 'getting', 'more', 'attention', 'family', 'children', 'age', 'selfish', ""n't"", 'yet', 'know', 'how', 'keep', 'check', 'away', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'asleep', 'woods', 'then', 'sailing', 'away', 'island', 'inhabited', 'monsters', 'seem', 'troubled', 'too', 'be', 'king', 'try', 'give', 'sort', 'happiness', 'cohesion', 'monsters', 'very', 'cleverly', 'represent', 'parts', 'Max', 'own', 'psyche', 'relationship', 'others', 'see', 'understand', 'own', 'violent', 'behavior', 'disturbing', 'fights', 'monsters', 'eventually', ""n't"", 'fit', 'able', 'be', 'king', 'anyone', 'island', 'also', 'understand', 'own', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'violent', 'behavior', 'are', 'hurtful', 'must', 'be', 'kept', 'check', 'home', 'mother', 'new', 'found', 'understanding', 'Even', 'very', 'melancholy', 'movie', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'really', 'emotional', 'impact', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'simple', 'children', 'film', 'boy', 'who', 'monsters', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'very', 'good-it', 'wistful', 'yearning', 'sound', 'subject', 'matter', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'reviews', 'film', 'are', 'firmly', 'split', 'right', 'down', 'middle', 'suspect', 'many', 'adults', 'going', 'expecting', 'lighthearted', 'fare', 'likes', 'Pixar', 'Disney', 'were', 'disappointed', 'many', 'children', 'will', 'not', 'understand', 'film', 'reviews', 'are', 'indication', 'many', 'adults', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'either', 'very', 'fact', 'film', 'so', 'provocative', 'deep', 'means', 'will', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'cult', 'classic', 'later', 'even', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'panned', 'critics', 'now', 'Sigh', 'best', 'films', 'usually', 'are', ""n't"", 'recognized', 'long', 'theater', 'premiers', 'Well', 'anyway', 'advice', 'adults', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'movie', 'view', 'first', 'make', 'own', 'judgment', 'letting', 'younger', 'child', 'see']",Where the Wild Things Are

1201467,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B001HN699A,Haunted Flower,"[4, 6]","Where the Wild Things Are DVD Review1 Disc Widescreen Edition (2009)Maurice Sendak's classic children's book, ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is brought to a full length live-action movie by writer Dave Eggers and writer/director, Steve Jonze. The story follows Max (played by Max Records, ironically), a young boy having trouble fitting in at home and giving in to precocious mood swings when in need of attention and after a particularly bad tantrum, he runs away from home and ends up at a magical land with giant wild creatures who have more problems than he does.Jonze's career has been heavily based in music videos and his musical influence shows the the flow of the movie wit the undercurrent of original songs by Karen O and the Kids running throughout including Grammy-nominated song, ""All Is Love."" The film is shot in such a way that you can almost feel the wind in your hair and want to reach out and ruffle the fur of some of the wild creatures. It's a magical, fantastic feeling, but this land isn't all fun and games.Many books turned into movies have explored the theme of having troubles at home, escaping to a magical place that seems full of fun, but then makes you grow up a little and wish you were back home with your loved ones. Examples would be The Wizard of Oz, Chronicles of Narnia, and Alice in Wonderland just to name a few. This one seems more like a movie for adults than children at times because of how strong emotions run between the wild things. They are not simple creatures, they have very complex motivations and when THEY have mood swings, someone is a LOT more likely to get hurt which wakes Max up a little.Catherine Keener is Max's mother and clearly there are issues at home of divorce, distancing siblings, and Mother's career and Max's imagination and free spirit cannot be contained when all he wants is attention and love. Keener's affection and desperation to have a peaceful, settled home set up the conflict beautifully. Max Records' authenticity is utterly sweet and engrossing. With a very short film career under his belt, he just seems so real and huggable but with real adult problems and emotions that his character doesn't clearly understand how to combat and control yet. This boy is a found treasure for this story.Carol is the main focus of tension in the furry family on the island in his discontent over a loved one, KW's inconsistent loyalties. In a fit of rage, he chooses destruction of their huts to unleash his fury and Max seeking a kindred spirit is all to eager to join in until the others make him realize the damage he's doing by aiding and threaten to eat him. Max quickly spins a story to make them adopt him as their king, but the responsibilities of being a leader come slowly to him when they ask for accountability and protection. His selfish tendencies have blinded him to the needs of others and he has to find a way to break his personal cycle in order to save himself. These are heavy themes presented in a fluffy, furry package.Carol is voiced by James Gandolfini and furry or not, I can sense major danger in him when he drifts to the dark side of his personality. His crying just bursts out of him, unable to be tamed. Lauren Ambrose becomes quite the stand-out voice as KW, the sometimes outsider. Carol is enamored with her and she can't take his constant moodiness and sometimes seeks out other milder company. His jealous can't be tamed, but her responses to it and presence in general is instantly likable and empathetic. She seems to have a beard but is the most loving of the group. Her one-on-ones with Max really get to the sentiment and heart of the story.Catherine O'Hara is always a delight and always distinctive in anything she plays. Here as Judith she is a consistent antagonist and foil to Max's plans or better put -- the reality check. When others want him to be king, she questions why. When they want to build a fort, she asks why. Described as ""a downer"", she's more of a pessimistic realist. Her significant other, Ira is softly voiced by Forrest Whitaker. Another stand-out for me was Paul Dano whom I loved in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and voices a pacifistic goat named Alexander. Mostly in the background in group scenes, but has a shining heart-to-heart with Max that is a real eye opener for his character and crucial to the film as a whole.Visually, the movie is stunning. The music picks you up and sweeps you away. The emotions told by the furry suits or human actors get right down to your core. It might not be a movie for everyone since it is artistic and folksy and requires some patience but a very good movie overall.Disc Extras:Not many. There are a series of Shorts by Lance Bangs encompassing the difficulty of filming a dog, crew pranks, kids taking over the movie, and a Vampire attack. All are very short, a little funny, but not a big deal overall.",4,Let the Wild Rumpus begin!,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,4872,"['Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'DVD', 'Review1', 'Disc',

1201473,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B001HN699A,James Hiller,"[4, 7]","When the original book came out way back when, it irked a lot of people for apparently ""rewarding bad behavior"" in the fact that Max got his meal delivered to his room. So it just goes to show you that this beautifully controversial story would still be irking some people, who miss out on the elegance, hostility, and charm of Spike Jonze's masterwork, ""Where the Wild Things Are"".Max, played with amazing emotional realism by Max Records, is a troubled, honest, real boy, fraught with real fears and real feelings. Abandoned by a sister growing older, and a mother trying to find her dating footing again, Max acts up, however wrongly, and flees his house. Sailing across the world, Max lands on an island to discover an amazing group of creatures called The Wild Things.Brilliantly voiced by James Gandolfini, the leader of the Wild Things named Carol is the very embodiment of Max's angst, power, rage, and healing. Max has an uneasy relationship with Carol because he has an uneasy relationship with himself and his emotions. As Max learns to ""tame"" the Wild Things, which, in reality, he cannot (who can ever master their own emotions ...  besides Spock, that is), he settles in on the island, only to realize that he misses the one place that he is truly loved for everything that he is, warts and all.The movie dares to suggest that a child's feelings are as real as an adult's feelings, and therein lies the controversy. Adults are forever dismissing children's fears and follies, their anger and sadness, as temporary, fleeting things that have no consequence. But to anyone who has grown up surviving their childhoods pains and traumas, you know exactly how real they are, how real Max is, and how real his Wild Things Are. It's daring to respect a child that makes this movie both wonderful and challenging for some. It's a true portrait, a poem of childhood, that's not to be forgotten.Is this a children's movie? Probably not. Some may enjoy it. But it's one of those movies that, on a rainy night, when you're all alone, and you fall into that retrospective funk that befalls us all from time to time, you'll want to pull out and watch, and live through, and feel, and eventually, totally love it.",5,Visual Poetry,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,2212,"['When', 'original', 'book', 'came', 'out', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'irked', 'lot', 'people', 'apparently', 'rewarding', 'bad', 'behavior', 'fact', 'Max', 'got', 'meal', 'delivered', 'room', 'just', 'show', 'beautifully', 'controversial', 'story', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'irking', 'people', 'who', 'miss', 'out', 'elegance', 'hostility', 'charm', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'masterwork', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', '.Max', 'played', 'amazing', 'emotional', 'realism', 'Max', 'Records', 'troubled', 'honest', 'real', 'boy', 'fraught', 'real', 'fears', 'real', 'feelings', 'Abandoned', 'sister', 'growing', 'older', 'mother', 'trying', 'find', 'dating', 'footing', 'again', 'Max', 'up', 'however', 'wrongly', 'house', 'Sailing', 'world', 'Max', 'island', 'discover', 'amazing', 'group', 'creatures', 'called', 'Wild', 'Things.Brilliantly', 'voiced', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'leader', 'Wild', 'Things', 'named', 'Carol', 'very', 'embodiment', 'Max', 'angst', 'power', 'rage', 'healing', 'Max', 'uneasy', 'relationship', 'Carol', 'uneasy', 'relationship', 'emotions', 'Max', 'tame', 'Wild', 'Things', 'reality', 'can', 'not', 'who', 'can', 'ever', 'master', 'own', 'emotions', 'Spock', 'island', 'only', 'realize', 'one', 'place', 'truly', 'loved', 'everything', 'warts', 'all.The', 'movie', 'dares', 'suggest', 'child', 'feelings', 'are', 'as', 'real', 'adult', 'feelings', 'therein', 'controversy', 'Adults', 'are', 'forever', 'dismissing', 'children', 'fears', 'follies', 'anger', 'sadness', 'temporary', 'fleeting', 'things', 'have', 'consequence', 'anyone', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'surviving', 'childhoods', 'pains', 'traumas', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'real', 'are', 'how', 'real', 'Max', 'how', 'real', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'daring', 'respect', 'child', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'challenging', 'true', 'portrait', 'poem', 'childhood', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten.Is', 'children', 'movie', 'Probably', 'not', 'may', 'enjoy', 'one', 'movies', 'rainy', 'night', 'when', ""'re"", 'alone', 'fall', 'retrospective', 'funk', 'time', 'time', ""'ll"", 'want', 'pull', 'out', 'watch', 'live', 'feel', 'eventually', 'totally', 'love']",Where the Wild Things Are

1201476,A1G1PX4U6RSZEA,B001HN699A,Jeremy P,"[9, 35]","Quickly: Sarah O (soundtrack artist) put the mic down.I just want to preface this by saying in the directors defense he was working with a story from a famous children's book, so there is only so much he can do with that story-line, however he failed to deliver. The first 10 minutes of ""real life"" without monsters was interesting and kept me amused, however it went downhill when Max made it to the island full of forlon argumentative monsters.  Granted the CGI with the monsters was pretty cool - cinematography wasn't anything sexy - the movie had an opportunity to be much better than what it came to be.  It was dull, boring, depressing and predictable at times.  I would of expected some humor incorporated into this movie, yet I can't recall laughing once throughout the entire film.  I feel if the director handled the direction of this film catering it toward both adult/children it would of had a better opportunity to shine.  Toward the end of the film I got exhausted watching it, and was anticipating it to end quickly.  On another note I couldn't tolerate any of the monsters, they were all depressed forlorn individuals that needed the help of MAX to ""save"" them.  MAX'S acting was very solid but that was the only bright-spot.  In closing, the message at the end of the story wasn't profound, or even eye-opening.  It was just some disobedient kid seeking attention from his family at any given opportunity.  In my opinion I feel Max was a selfish little boy attempting to garner attention at the most inopportune times from his sister/mother.  I'm sorry Max, but mommy can't put the glass of wine down and play in your fort.  I'm sorry Max, but Claire is an adolescent, and is going through a period in her life where she is making friends with people her age, she has no time to run around in your igloo.  Spike Jonze's presence in this movie did not go un-noticed with his incorporation of indie/arsty rock shenanigans.  I can imagine 20 indie rock kids sipping tall cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon and/or coffee gathered around the television enjoying every second of this monstrosity (no pun intended). ha ha.  Ok i'm done.

1201477,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B001HN699A,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[4, 6]","In Where the Wild Things Are, an adventurous boy named Max (Max Records) runs away to his imagination where he thinks things will be better than reality. In the real world, his mother (Catherine Keener) is divorced and dating someone. He feels depressed, lonely and misunderstand and he takes his anger out by throwing things or wearing his wolf pajamas and being aggressive towards his mother.His imaginary world isn't too perfect though. He befriends creatures that are rarely happy and each one represent different things that he's going through. For instance Carol (James Gandolfini) and K.W (Lauren Ambrose) have had a falling out due to her wanting to be friends with two owls, while Carol doesn't see what's so great about them. So they represent how Max's parents have grown apart and possibly how Max feels as if he has grown apart from his mother.Max wants to be king of the creatures and make everyone happy. Which is hard since Carol doesn't like changes as much as Max doesn't. He represents Max's unhappy and destructive side. When K.W tries to bring her owl friends into the new home Max and Carol are building, Carol isn't too happy about it. So Max basically gets a good look at himself through the behavior of the creatures.The movie is as deep as it sounds. It's not really scary like some critics have said, but it doesn't have any sense of wonder or magic. In another words, there's nothing that will make kids say ""wow"". I'm not sure why the trailers tried to even advertise the movie as a kids movie, because it's not. There's even talk about how the sun will some day die and how Max is worried about that.It may sound like I didn't enjoy the movie. I enjoyed it for what it is. It's a moving and smart movie. It's too smart for a young child to try and figure out though. A movie about a boy trying to figure things out along with angry, depressed and confused creatures of his imagination isn't exactly fun for the whole family.

It goes far beyond the delightful Sendak book which, delightful as it may be, tells us very little about human nature.

To be truthful, I would not have watched this film had i not recently seen Her by the same director.  I felt that anyone who could bring such intriguing complexity and charm to a relationship between a lonely man and his new computer operating system (Her) might do wonders with a tale that is imaginative to begin with and I was not wrong.  It's like nothing so much as The Wizard Of Oz in that characters from a child's real life are transmogrified into fanciful fantasy personages through what we can only assume is a dream state.

1201484,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B001HN699A,Jordan David,"[4, 5]","When I first heard that Sendak's intriguing short story would make its way to the big screen, I laughed out loud in perplexity.  There are a lot of things in this world that seem impossible:  Making a polished and cohesive film about ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is one of them - or, so I thought.The first signs of relief came when Spike Jonze, the mind behind cinematic benders such as ""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" took the helm and made it his baby.  He fought hard for his vision to be realized; let it be known that I consider it a compliment when I say that I had plenty of moments in the theatre where I quietly asked myself, ""they were given a $100 million budget to make THIS?""Jonze's vision certainly has been realized, and the result is something beyond a typical family film, or films in general, for that matter.  Working on a paper-thin narrative requires the steady hand of a committed director; honestly, had this film been constructed by anyone else, it would have fallen into the darkest pits of production Hell, never to see the light of day.Instead, Jonze has given us a difficult, complicated, and altogether spellbinding piece of avant garde cinema that has no real audience it specifically appeals to.  Children and adults alike will no doubt be fascinated, as well as disturbed and confused, by Jonze's audacious storytelling.  It's all a part of the magic, really - warts and all.  It's intelligent without feeling pretentious; it's bittersweet without being melancholy.  This is a romantic film that soars on the wings of eccentric, compelling characters, and a genuinely talented young actor.There was a conscious decision made to use typical puppetry for the wild things themselves, with the faces being the only CG facet about them.  It seems like an odd concept but, when you're faced with these creatures for the first time, it's honestly difficult to think of them being any other way.  They do have an air of menace to them, but this is underscored by a heartbreaking sadness that always seems just underneath their exaggerated smiles as they cope with the deterioration of their own simple society.  The end result is a group of extraordinarily compelling characters that stay with you long after you leave the theatre.Again, it needs to be said that the lead protagonist, Max, is portrayed beautifully by novice actor Max Records, who maintains authenticity when his character is faced with situations that demand a complex emotional response which reside beyond that of typical childhood ignorance and idiosyncrasies.  His interaction with the wild things is a transitional phase from friendship to misunderstandings and eventual fear in the face of change, which none of the characters are capable of coping with.  It's a very sad story, one that cuts deep and hits home with the little child in all of us.Still, there is beauty to be found, regardless, and you will feel that, when the credits begin to roll, all is as it should be, because you know that it couldn't have been any other way.  The best part is watching the characters come to this realization.Undeniably dark, but still overflowing with love and a recognizable understanding of the source material, Jonze's ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is one of the most unusual and fascinating films of the year.",4,Where the Wild Things Are,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,3310,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Sendak', 'intriguing', 'short', 'story', 'would', 'make', 'way', 'big', 'screen', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'perplexity', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'world', 'seem', 'impossible', 'Making', 'polished', 'cohesive', 'film', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'one', 'thought.The', 'first', 'signs', 'relief', 'came', 'when', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'mind', 'cinematic', 'benders', 'such', 'Adaptation', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'took', 'helm', 'made', 'baby', 'fought', 'hard', 'vision', 'be', 'realized', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'consider', 'compliment', 'when', 'say', 'had', 'plenty', 'moments', 'theatre', 'where', 'quietly', 'asked', 'were', 'given', '100', 'million', 'budget', 'make', 'THIS', 'Jonze', 'vision', 'certainly', 'been', 'realized', 'result', 'something', 'typical', 'family', 'film', 'films', 'general', 'matter', 'Working', 'paper-thin', 'narrative', 'steady', 'hand', 'committed', 'director', 'honestly', 'had', 'film', 'been', 'constructed', 'anyone', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'darkest', 'pits', 'production', 'Hell', 'never', 'see', 'light', 'day.Instead', 'Jonze', 'given', 'difficult', 'complicated', 'altogether', 'spellbinding', 'piece', 'avant', 'garde', 'cinema', 'real', 'audience', 'specifically', 'appeals', 'Children', 'adults', 'alike', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'fascinated', 'as', 'well', 'disturbed', 'confused', 'Jonze', 'audacious', 'storytelling', 'part', 'magic', 'really', 'warts', 'intelligent', 'feeling', 'pretentious', 'bittersweet', 'being', 'melancholy', 'romantic', 'film', 'wings', 'eccentric', 'compelling', 'characters', 'genuinely', 'talented', 'young', 'actor.There', 'was', 'conscious', 'decision', 'made', 'use', 'typical', 'puppetry', 'wild', 'things', 'being', 'only', 'CG', 'facet', 'odd', 'concept', 'when', ""'re"", 'faced', 'creatures', 'first', 'time', 'honestly', 'difficult', 'think', 'being', 'other', 'way', 'do', 'have', 'air', 'menace', 'underscored', 'heartbreaking', 'sadness', 'always', 'just', 'underneath', 'exaggerated', 'smiles', 'cope', 'deterioration', 'own', 'simple', 'society', 'end', 'result', 'group', 'extraordinarily', 'compelling', 'characters', 'stay', 'long', 'leave', 'theatre.Again', 'be', 'said', 'lead', 'protagonist', 'Max', 'portrayed', 'beautifully', 'novice', 'actor', 'Max', 'Records', 'who', 'authenticity', 'when', 'character', 'faced', 'situations', 'demand', 'complex', 'emotional', 'response', 'reside', 'typical', 'childhood', 'ignorance', 'idiosyncrasies', 'interaction', 'wild', 'things', 'transitional', 'phase', 'friendship', 'misunderstandings', 'eventual', 'fear', 'face', 'change', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'capable', 'coping', 'very', 'sad', 'story', 'one', 'deep', 'home', 'little', 'child', 'us.Still', 'beauty', 'be', 'found', 'regardless', 'will', 'feel', 'when', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll', 'should', 'be', 'know', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'other', 'way', 'best', 'part', 'watching', 'characters', 'come', 'realization.Undeniably', 'dark', 'still', 'overflowing', 'love', 'recognizable', 'understanding', 'source', 'material', 'Jonze', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'fascinating', 'films', 'year']",Where the Wild Things Are
1201485,AO80ZID761BZH,B001HN699A,Joseph_,"[6, 7]","I've always known the simple, strange yet touching book this movie was based upon, and I also knew the adaption was somewhat poorly received here on Amazon. But I was still curious to see how the director translated the critically acclaimed book into a live-action movie, so I went ahead and rented it.And really, as I watched, I realized all the negative criticism it got was wrong. I was actually fairly pleased by the movie, and genuinely like it; but there are things that... well, let me put it like this: I won't bet buying this movie.You probably already know the basic plot and such, so I'll just get right to my point. As the director said, it is truly not a movie created for children, it's about childhood, so it's certainly not playful and light like you might expect. The anger of the main character, Max, hurts all those around him and even worse, himself. This is an interesting idea to pin a story upon: anger in siblings is part of my life, as my younger brother is an absolute monster when he wants to be. You could say I connected to the movie in that way.But it startled me by how dark it was. The darkness was only slightly subtle, and grew even more with the plot. As soon as we run with Max into the island and see all the large, odd-looking monsters, you get this feeling. At first, the monsters are friendly enough, albeit violent hints towards their muddled hearts. But the whole time, you get a creepy gut-feeling; the whole movie is strange, and not beautiful strange like some movies. No, it was an uncomfortable strange, and all the monsters just made that uncomfortable, weird feeling grow.Their dark, corrupt personalities shine towards the end of the movie, when Max's reign as their ""king"" becomes broken and dangerous. Yes, a monster's arm gets ripped off, and it's less brutal than you think, but shocking and a little frightening all the same, no matter how old you are. So yeah, that's just one of the things that pretty much makes this an adult movie, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's just that it makes it all kinda confusing; I mean, it certainly looks like a kid's movie, what with the big, furry creatures and a kid in the starring role.But despite the startling darkness, there's nothing I can criticize. The plot-line is pretty beautiful and crisp, putting aside my aforementioned thoughts. There's magic within the movie, and some crazy things like a huge, walking dog on the desert. But I think the over-all message is what counts, and makes this movie a strange beauty: things won't last forever, so cherish them while you have them. The sun is one topic used to paint this message, and I saw it represented in the anger between Max and his mother, which fades when he realizes how much he loves her.I can't say the acting was bad. The CG/puppetry (those must have been some big puppets or suits, whatever they used) in the movie is perfectly fine. They got lucky on this movie, because since they're creatures nobody's seen, they don't have to be perfect CG like dragons in the Harry franchise. So they can look like puppets sometimes, and you accept it as the strange magic of the island. The voices were crisp and sounded a little too normal to come from huge, strange creatures' mouths, but whatever. And their howling that matches any dog's howl was also weird... but acceptable.I think the little star of the whole film held up his part just fine. He brought a struggling, lonely character across the screen that I rather hated at the beginning (the first scene between the dog and boy with a fork startled me; after all, if he had stabbed the dog... well, let's just say this review would have never been made) became a mature young man that I understood. I thought his character matured a little too much for a boy so wild at the beginning, but hey, it's something I can overlook.So it was a fine movie. Not four-star... certainly not five star... but three star. In the middle.

1201496,A204UDH31JJ5ZW,B001HN699A,Logan Stewart,"[2, 3]","Like most folks under the age of 40, I read Where the Wild Things Are when I was in elementary school. The book, written by Maurice Sendak, was a particular favorite, alongside classics like Green Eggs & Ham (by Dr. Seuss), Love You Forever (by Robert Munsch), and Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (by Judith Viorst). Yes, I remember really liking Where the Wild Things Are, especially from the fascinating art and vivid imagination of the protagonist, Max.When I first heard about the movie adaptation last year, I was hesitantly excited. I wasn't sure how there could be a movie made from a short, ten sentence picture book, but I still decided that I would see it.Where the Wild Things Are, directed by Spike Jonze, stars Max Records as Max from the book. (I know, it's kind of ironic, but it's the truth according to Wikipedia.) The movie is quite similar to book in several ways, but there are many creative avenues pursued by Jonze as well. The film runs for just over an hour and a half.The acting from the movie was solid and well done, and the emotions on Max's young face were perfectly captured for his scenes. His anger was vivid, his sadness was evident, and his joy was impossible not to notice. In fact, this role was only Record's second filmed acting role, and his performance was noteworthy. In addition to the fine acting by Records, the voice acting of the Wild Things was top notch. Many well known actors fill these roles, and all do a great job with giving unique character to their Monster.To me, the best thing about this movie was the surreal art of the Wild Things. Their island is vast, but somehow small, too. There are expansive deserts, a creepy forest, rocks and bluffs, and a magnificent oceanscape, all complete on the one island. Each monster is beautifully crafted and marvelously detailed, from their odd assortment of feet to their individual heads. And the giant fort-house that was built was breathtaking.Another thing I really enjoyed about this film was the accompanying soundtrack. Some songs were guttural and wild, filled with arcane whoops and screams that instilled a sense of craziness. Other tracks were somber and bleak, and these fit their individual scenes perfectly.It may come as a surprise, then, when I say that I did not enjoy the movie. While the acting was fantastic and the art was beautiful, the film was too weighty, too serious, for me to say that I enjoyed it. Max is a very mean, lonely kid, and he spends all of his time in his own imaginary world. He is not disciplined at home, and at one point he even bites his mom. But this was not why the film was heavy. No, the heaviness sets in when Max runs away from the ""Real World"" and goes into his imagination.It's easy, yet complicated, to see the metaphors and symbolism each of the monsters embodies. They are all depressed and sad and they are hoping for a King to make them feel happy. Max becomes that king, but he fails, and everybody stays pretty much the same: depressed and sad. The heaviness of life sets in on the island, and it's a little frightening. Eventually Max realizes he wants to go home and he leaves the island to its own problems.The conclusion of the film is a powerhouse of emotions, and I spied my eight-year-old brother-in-law wiping tears from his eyes. Indeed, the heartstrings were tugged a bit, but I didn't turn to tears, only disgust and confusion. After I left the movie, my remarks were that it was not what I was expecting. No, it was too heavy of a film, and because of that I did not enjoy it. However, I'm not really sure if you're supposed to enjoy it. Sure, the imagination was a fun trip, but it was too rooted in the sadness of life and love to last.Overall, it's a bit unfair for me to not like the film. Really I was upset that there were all these valid life problems presented and no real resolution, which is how life truly is. But, we Americans like our cinema to end with resolution, and I felt that there were too many loose ends in this movie. So, in the end, I can recommend watching the film, if only to revel a bit in childhood fantasy, but I can't promise you that you'll glean much from it other than life is heavy and hard, and sometimes even our imagination is not an escape.",4,"Wonderful Memories, Sad Stories, and Nice Music",1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,4276,"['most', 'folks', 'age', '40', 'read', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'when', 'was', 'elementary', 'school', 'book', 'written', 'Maurice', 'Sendak', 'was', 'particular', 'favorite', 'classics', 'Green', 'Eggs', 'Ham', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'Love', 'Forever', 'Robert', 'Munsch', 'Alexander', 'Terrible', 'Horrible', 'No', 'Good', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Day', 'Judith', 'Viorst', 'Yes', 'remember', 'really', 'liking', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'especially', 'fascinating', 'art', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'protagonist', 'Max.When', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'hesitantly', 'excited', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'movie', 'made', 'short', 'ten', 'sentence', 'picture', 'book', 'still', 'decided', 'would', 'see', 'it.Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'directed', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'Max', 'Records', 'Max', 'book', 'know', 'kind', 'ironic', 'truth', 'according', 'Wikipedia', 'movie', 'quite', 'similar', 'book', 'several', 'ways', 'are', 'many', 'creative', 'avenues', 'pursued', 'Jonze', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'just', 'hour', 'half.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'solid', 'well', 'done', 'emotions', 'Max', 'young', 'face', 'were', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'scenes', 'anger', 'was', 'vivid', 'sadness', 'was', 'evident', 'joy', 'was', 'impossible', 'not', 'notice', 'fact', 'role', 'was', 'only', 'Record', 'second', 'filmed', 'acting', 'role', 'performance', 'was', 'noteworthy', 'addition', 'fine', 'acting', 'Records', 'voice', 'acting', 'Wild', 'Things', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'Many', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'fill', 'roles', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'giving', 'unique', 'character', 'Monster.To', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'surreal', 'art', 'Wild', 'Things', 'island', 'vast', 'somehow', 'small', 'too', 'are', 'expansive', 'deserts', 'creepy', 'forest', 'rocks', 'bluffs', 'magnificent', 'oceanscape', 'complete', 'one', 'island', 'monster', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'marvelously', 'detailed', 'odd', 'assortment', 'feet', 'individual', 'heads', 'giant', 'fort-house', 'was', 'built', 'was', 'breathtaking.Another', 'thing', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'accompanying', 'soundtrack', 'songs', 'were', 'guttural', 'wild', 'filled', 'arcane', 'whoops', 'screams', 'instilled', 'sense', 'craziness', 'Other', 'tracks', 'were', 'somber', 'bleak', 'fit', 'individual', 'scenes', 'perfectly.It', 'may', 'come', 'surprise', 'then', 'when', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'fantastic', 'art', 'was', 'beautiful', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'weighty', 'too', 'serious', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Max', 'very', 'mean', 'lonely', 'kid', 'time', 'own', 'imaginary', 'world', 'not', 'disciplined', 'home', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'mom', 'was', 'not', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'heavy', 'No', 'heaviness', 'sets', 'when', 'Max', 'away', 'Real', 'World', 'imagination.It', 'easy', 'yet', 'complicated', 'see', 'metaphors', 'symbolism', 'monsters', 'embodies', 'are', 'depressed', 'sad', 'are', 'hoping', 'King', 'make', 'feel', 'happy', 'Max', 'king', 'everybody', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'depressed', 'sad', 'heaviness', 'life', 'sets', 'island', 'little', 'frightening', 'Eventually', 'Max', 'go', 'home', 'island', 'own', 'problems.The', 'conclusion', 'film', 'powerhouse', 'emotions', 'spied', 'eight-year-old', 'brother-in-law', 'wiping', 'tears', 'eyes', 'Indeed', 'heartstrings', 'were', 'tugged', 'bit', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'tears', 'only', 'disgust', 'confusion', 'left', 'movie', 'remarks', 'were', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'No', 'was', 'too', 'heavy', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'enjoy', 'Sure', 'imagination', 'was', 'fun', 'trip', 'was', 'too', 'rooted', 'sadness', 'life', 'love', 'last.Overall', 'bit', 'unfair', 'not', 'film', 'Really', 'was', 'upset', 'were', 'valid', 'life', 'problems', 'presented', 'real', 'resolution', 'how', 'life', 'truly', 'Americans', 'cinema', 'end', 'resolution', 'felt', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'movie', 'So', 'end', 'can', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'only', 'revel', 'bit', 'childhood', 'fantasy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'promise', ""'ll"", 'glean', 'much', 'other', 'life', 'heavy', 'hard', 'sometimes', 'even', 'imagination', 'not', 'escape']",Where the Wild Things Are

Not bragging, just stating that.  I usually tend to support the idea I'm thinking this movie was going for.  Kids, especially in today's times, need something to help them through tough situations.  Certain issues are starting to emerge that are having to be addressed at earlier ages.  But this movie, in my opinion, is horrible.  Not only is it confusing, but it has bad messages and promotes violence.  I also find it quite disturbing and scary, very dark and sinister even in the eyes of someone my age.  I can only imagine what younger children think.  This is not the storybook I loved as a child and parents beware!Max is horribly out of control.  In the book he is portrayed as being a rowdy kid, in this movie he clearly has some mental issues that need to be tended to.  He runs away (after physically and verbally abusing his mother) and falls into the fantasy of this island inhabited by these large furry monster-like creatures.  After he finally lies and convinces the monsters he is a king, they decide not to eat him.  Max being king leads to more and more lies.  All the monsters begin to turn on Max and each other.  Max usually remedies this by encouraging drop kicking, dog piles, and even suggests they have a war with each other that is won by bashing each other in the head with dirt clods.  One monster becomes injured during the fight and Max eggs him on to continue throwing rocks at the creature, taking out his legs and then knocking him head over hill even after he has announced surrender.  The monster falls in a very brutal manner and receives a huge gash.  When Max has a falling out with Carol (the main monster) he chases Max trying to eat him, forcing max to hide in the belly of another monster.  Carol even rips his best friend's arm off! Sure there is no blood, but you can clearly see the severed arm and sand comes pouring out of the creature's body.  He replaces the arm with a stick.  The movie is just dripping with violence.The emotional state of Max, Carol, and all of the creatures is really confusing.  I was very uneasy because of this.  It kind of disrupted everything the movie was aiming for.  I think this is a horrible example to children because the monsters sometimes love Max, but when he doesn't do things exactly the way they want, they start to lash out on everyone.  More importantly, in the end there is really no clear resolution to all their problems! Max finally snaps back into reality and goes home smiling.  Heck, he was a happy kid at the beginning of the movie! He would smile one minute and the next jump off the dinner table, bite his mom, and then run away wearing a wolf costume into the woods and scream blood curdling screams and slam sticks around.  Seriously, my thought was ""Is this kid worshipping the devil?!""  The images of the movie are freaky and horrid and disturbed me, an adult!  Even some of the sounds in this movie are morbid and sadistic.  Parents, if you're just itching to give your kids nightmares, this is the movie for you! I'd let my kids watch Child's Play before this! At least they could understand there was an absolute evil being rather than some monsters with schizophrenia who hate/love/hate/love you.I would suggest letting kids watch this when hitting about 7th grade, but its just too screwed up for a lesser age!  Its that confusing and damaging in my opinion (and like I said, I think kids do need to mature faster now and address difficult problems but this is not the way to handle it!)  As far as a movie for adults, Where the Wild Things Are is still a flop.  Boring, stupid, lame, and all covered in a stench of someone who tried too hard to relay messages through a movie.

Growing up, I was a huge fan of this book reading it no less than 10 times a year.The movie played out exactly as I had expected it....darker than the book.  What else do you expect from a story that is, at core, sad.  Throughout the movie, I laughed, I almost cried, I felt fear, and above all, I felt what it was like to be a child again.The movie starts with Max and his imagination.  He misses his dad and has to live with his mother and sister.  Upset that no one pays attention to him, he goes on a tirade that leads to him running away.  Of course, this is how he gets to where the wild things are.There, he becomes King and helps build all the creatures a home.  The movie bases around the interaction between Max and the creatures.  It ends on a happy yet still sad note.Behind me in the theater, two girls said it was the worst movie they ever saw.  I was confused because it's high up on my list, number 2 of the year (next to Zombieland).  Obviously, they didn't like the book OR don't understand that the whole story is a kid struggling to balance imagination and the real world.  Kids cannot deal with pain.  They find other ways to cope.  Max realizes the pain and makes it all the more hard to cope with.  He breaks free when with the creatures, at first, and just acts like a kid having fun.This is just a beautiful movie that hits all categories from childrens movie, drama, action, horror, comedy and just strange movies.

My kids watch it here and there so I have the opportunity to re-watch.  It's just a really introspective, darkly entertaining film version of the book.  It's really just as lovely as the book.  The book is so simple and leaves a whole world left to the imagination and they really took that open-endedness and ran with it.  I think the result is a very good movie.  I don't know how much it's really for kids.  Older kids will get a whole lot more out of it.  My son is only 3 and he does enjoy it but not for the reasons he will when he's older.  My daughter, age 4, likes it too.  If I had had a better understanding of what the movie was like then I may have waited to have them watch it but there is nothing harmful in it and I find my children like the off, understated humor.

Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[8, 11]","I really enjoyed this book as a child, and the cartoon adaptation that had ""The Night Kitchen"" and several other short stories as well.  That being said, I did not particularly enjoy this version.Max, having angered his mother and also being up to no good all day, runs away from home and finds a sailboat that brings him to a different land.  Here in this land, he is made King of the things and at first all is happy.  One of the things, Carol, is eerily similar in attitude to Max.  He is full of rage and doesn't deal with his anger very well.After a fort is made, and the object of Carol's affections KW shows up with some new friends, Carol goes into a rage and the things start fighting.  Realizing that everything is not as wonderful as it seems to be King, Max begins to lose his enchantment over the island.This film really deviated from the book.  In fact, the character of Max kind of scared me.  As my fiance put it, he seems like a serial killer in the  making.  A fair description?  Maybe not, but the kid has some real issues in this film.  It also deviates from the book in the fact that originally, Max is just sent to his room where he dreams up all this stuff, he doesn't run away.As far as kids watching this it has the potential to scare younger children.  Lets face it, monsters are scary at that age.  There is a lot of anger and violence and I don't see any lessons in how to control that or overcome it.  And Max is allowed to be an absolute terror with no repercussions.  In all it seems that maybe this film should actually be for an older audience for artistic quality.  Most children watching this aren't going to realize its showing that its ok for them to have ferocious feelings, its just going to show them a kid who's being a terror and gets away with it.  Its for the adults to look back and understand that sometimes this is how life goes, children don't usually have the social maturity to understand these life lessons without experience.To be honest I've seen it said that if you don't enjoy this film you don't remember what to be a kid was like.  I was Max at one time, a loner no one played with, separated family, and picked on a great deal.  This movie does not remind me of my childhood at all and I'm not that far away from being a kid I don't remember what it was like.  I honestly hope that few childhoods are filled with such rage as Max's; even if he does ""grow"" in the movie.The film was well made though with excellent graphics.  The monster costumes (computer animation?) were incredible and very realistic.  I also liked the area where the movie was filmed, it was very scenic.  I thought especially, that the scene with Max and Carol walking through the sand dunes was touching and beautiful.  I also enjoyed the structure of the fort and Carol's little world.  It made me want to create twig mountains of my own.The music in this film was kind of trippy.  Lots of weird voices and a pleasant enough tune.  I can't decide whether I liked it or not.  If anything, it was a bit unsettling.Overall I probably won't watch this movie again.  I'll stick to the book. While it had beautiful graphics the movie kind of dragged for me and the portrayal of some of my beloved characters was a bit off putting.  If you haven't read the book though, I'm sure it can be enjoyed greatly.",3,Where the Wild Things Are,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,3329,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'child', 'cartoon', 'adaptation', 'had', 'Night', 'Kitchen', 'several', 'other', 'short', 'stories', 'well', 'being', 'said', 'did', 'not', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'version.Max', 'having', 'angered', 'mother', 'also', 'being', 'up', 'good', 'day', 'away', 'home', 'sailboat', 'different', 'land', 'Here', 'land', 'made', 'King', 'things', 'first', 'happy', 'One', 'things', 'Carol', 'eerily', 'similar', 'attitude', 'Max', 'full', 'rage', ""n't"", 'deal', 'anger', 'very', 'well.After', 'fort', 'made', 'object', 'Carol', 'affections', 'KW', 'up', 'new', 'friends', 'Carol', 'rage', 'things', 'start', 'fighting', 'Realizing', 'everything', 'not', 'as', 'wonderful', 'be', 'King', 'Max', 'lose', 'enchantment', 'island.This', 'film', 'really', 'deviated', 'book', 'fact', 'character', 'Max', 'kind', 'scared', 'fiance', 'put', 'serial', 'killer', 'making', 'fair', 'description', 'Maybe', 'not', 'kid', 'real', 'issues', 'film', 'also', 'book', 'fact', 'originally', 'Max', 'just', 'sent', 'room', 'where', 'up', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'run', 'away.As', 'far', 'kids', 'watching', 'potential', 'scare', 'younger', 'children', 'face', 'monsters', 'are', 'scary', 'age', 'lot', 'anger', 'violence', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'lessons', 'how', 'control', 'overcome', 'Max', 'allowed', 'be', 'absolute', 'terror', 'repercussions', 'maybe', 'film', 'should', 'actually', 'be', 'older', 'audience', 'artistic', 'quality', 'Most', 'children', 'watching', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'realize', 'showing', 'ok', 'have', 'ferocious', 'feelings', 'just', 'going', 'show', 'kid', 'who', 'being', 'terror', 'away', 'adults', 'look', 'back', 'understand', 'sometimes', 'how', 'life', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'have', 'social', 'maturity', 'understand', 'life', 'lessons', 'experience.To', 'be', 'honest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'be', 'kid', 'was', 'was', 'Max', 'one', 'time', 'loner', 'one', 'played', 'separated', 'family', 'picked', 'great', 'deal', 'movie', 'not', 'remind', 'childhood', ""'m"", 'not', 'far', 'away', 'being', 'kid', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'honestly', 'hope', 'few', 'childhoods', 'are', 'filled', 'such', 'rage', 'Max', 'even', 'grow', 'movie.The', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'made', 'excellent', 'graphics', 'monster', 'costumes', 'computer', 'animation', 'were', 'incredible', 'very', 'realistic', 'also', 'liked', 'area', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', 'very', 'scenic', 'thought', 'especially', 'scene', 'Max', 'Carol', 'walking', 'sand', 'dunes', 'was', 'touching', 'beautiful', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'structure', 'fort', 'Carol', 'little', 'world', 'made', 'want', 'create', 'twig', 'mountains', 'own.The', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'kind', 'trippy', 'Lots', 'weird', 'voices', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'tune', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'liked', 'not', 'anything', 'was', 'bit', 'unsettling.Overall', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'again', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'book', 'had', 'beautiful', 'graphics', 'movie', 'kind', 'dragged', 'portrayal', 'beloved', 'characters', 'was', 'bit', 'off', 'putting', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'greatly']",Where the Wild Things Are
1201521,A1ER6IYOMM8VCT,B001HN699A,"! MR. KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[3, 6]","When a Ammie friend of mine raved about this movie I knew it would have to be great! I have always been a big fan of the book 'Where The Wild Things Are' and I was curious to see how the movie would play out. Considering the book only has a little over 300 words, I was very impressed at the embellishments the film was able to achieve. It not only captures the essence of the book, it surpasses it in every way.I would like to point out that this film will NOT appeal to everyone. It's kind of an art film, which isn't a bad thing, but it will not please the majority. I must confess that on my first trip through this bizarre world I was a little perplexed. I did ""get it"", but sometimes I'm a little leery of my own interpretations. Having always been a child or felt like one even in my late 40's, I loved the way the makers of this film were able to capture how a child feels and more importantly were able to make us feel how a child feels throughout this film.There is an uneasiness watching it as you never really know if things are going to go terribly wrong. The character's on this island of monsters are really different facets of Max's personality allowed to completely run amok. Carol filled with rage, Alexander who feels ignored, the mysterious and brooding Bull, Ira and Julia, one who need praise and the other is insecure, Douglas the soothing inner voice and K.C. the mother figure to Max.Besides being a very deep and impressively written film, it also looks fantastic with it's bizarre world that these incredible creatures inhabit. I personally can't see how a kid could really enjoy this film, but after talking about this film with my buddy Andrew, he told me his very young daughter loved this film too! I guess kids are more in tune than we give them credit for? I know when I watch this film from time to time, I will always think of Andrew and his little ""muffin"" running wild on all fours on this island, better known as their living room when the wild things are fast asleep.......This one's for you Andrew!.....and a rather long review for me! :-DAs for the DVD the film looks great, but the extras on the single disc are a bummer, a pretty sad release for such a great film!",5,WHERE THE ELLINGTON'S ARE!

So instead of depicting Max as just a mischievous, normal little boy of about five, they turn him an evolving psychotic around ten growing up in a seriously dysfunctional family setting. I give this two stars because, in fact, the production values are excellent. If this movie were not based on one of the greatest children's books of all time, it might have something interesting to say about schizophrenia. But as I bought it to enjoy the story my 42-year-old son loved above all others when he was three, I was not just disappointed. I was horrified on the one side and depressed on the other. I won't possibly share this movie with my four-year-old grandson who loves the book. The beginning would bore him and when Max finally gets to the island, the grousing Wild Things would turn him off. I'll wait until he's studying psychology in college to tell him this movie was made.

1201535,A2ZO9D2RMMLHDP,B001HN699A,Patrick Murray,"[2, 3]","This movie is, in a word:  Beautiful.Visually stunning.But not all that great, otherwise.I'm not going to go on about how huge a fan I am of the book (I am), nor am I going to wax intellectual by discussing all the psychological ramifications of...... you get the point.The movie, as a movie only, an outlet for entertainment, a couple of hours of escape into the magical realm of cinema:  Here's my review of THAT.Plot:  kind of thin.  Troubled kid, shown clearly and without argument to be a troubled kid.  He has a major tantrum, acts out poorly, bites his mom when she tries to corral him, and then runs off into the night.  He runs into the woods, sets sail on a boat to a land far away, populated by monsters.Monsters opt to make him their king instead of eat him.  His reign as king starts out well, and steadily declines.He realizes he's just a boy, not a king, not equipped to make decisions, not someone who should be in charge, and sails home.  He gets home, and his mom gives him cake.Fade to black.Visually:  As I stated above, stunning.  Not just landscapes on the island, which were gorgeous, but early scenes as well.  The disjointed and chaotic feel of the snowball fight between Max and his older sister's friends, sucks you in.You FEEL how being outnumbered and having your snow fort come down around you can be very scary. Innocent kid fun CAN turn scary in an instant, and this scene was particularly effective.Same with the dirt clod fight.  A relatively innocent incident becomes beautiful and chaotic and frightening in a moment, and the violence sways back and forth between being funny and being scary.A final, lesser example, is the dog pile scene.  Max feels secure and safe in a pile of monsters, but as they continue to pile on, you realize he might just get crushed, and his safe security has a bit of a dark side to it all of the sudden.So, a beautiful movie with a thin plot.  It needs strong characters to make it work.We don't really get those, either.This movie calls upon a small boy to carry it on his shoulders.  He does a commendable job, but when his supporting cast is a bunch of dysfunctional monsters, there's only so much we can hope for.I was bored 20 minutes in, though occasionally finding myself in awe of what I was watching, for most of the rest of it.Movie gets three stars because of a random series of moments within the film.Some of the one on one interactions between Max and the two main monsters were touching.For example the scene in the cave, when Carol shows max his model city.I also tended to enjoy the scenes with Max and KW.And there as was the one scene before he sets sail, where he makes up a story to entertain his mom, between bouts of out of control, destructive behaviour.  These brief moments really touched me, and stood out in a mostly boring, but beautiful, movie.",3,"Beautiful to look at, but...",1301270400,"03 28, 2011",2011,2840,"['movie', 'word', 'Beautiful.Visually', 'not', 'great', 'otherwise.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'how', 'huge', 'fan', 'am', 'book', 'am', 'am', 'going', 'wax', 'intellectual', 'discussing', 'psychological', 'ramifications', 'get', 'point.The', 'movie', 'movie', 'only', 'outlet', 'entertainment', 'couple', 'hours', 'escape', 'magical', 'realm', 'cinema', 'Here', 'review', 'THAT.Plot', 'kind', 'thin', 'Troubled', 'kid', 'shown', 'clearly', 'argument', 'be', 'troubled', 'kid', 'major', 'tantrum', 'out', 'poorly', 'mom', 'when', 'corral', 'then', 'runs', 'off', 'night', 'woods', 'sets', 'sail', 'boat', 'land', 'far', 'away', 'populated', 'monsters.Monsters', 'opt', 'make', 'king', 'instead', 'eat', 'reign', 'king', 'out', 'well', 'steadily', 'declines.He', 'just', 'boy', 'not', 'king', 'not', 'equipped', 'make', 'decisions', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'charge', 'home', 'home', 'mom', 'cake.Fade', 'black.Visually', 'stated', 'stunning', 'Not', 'just', 'landscapes', 'island', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'early', 'scenes', 'well', 'disjointed', 'chaotic', 'feel', 'snowball', 'fight', 'Max', 'older', 'sister', 'friends', 'sucks', 'in.You', 'FEEL', 'how', 'being', 'outnumbered', 'having', 'snow', 'fort', 'come', 'down', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'scary', 'Innocent', 'kid', 'fun', 'CAN', 'turn', 'scary', 'instant', 'scene', 'was', 'particularly', 'effective.Same', 'dirt', 'clod', 'fight', 'relatively', 'innocent', 'incident', 'beautiful', 'chaotic', 'frightening', 'moment', 'violence', 'back', 'forth', 'being', 'funny', 'being', 'scary.A', 'final', 'lesser', 'example', 'dog', 'pile', 'scene', 'Max', 'feels', 'secure', 'safe', 'pile', 'monsters', 'continue', 'pile', 'realize', 'might', 'just', 'get', 'crushed', 'safe', 'security', 'bit', 'dark', 'side', 'sudden.So', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'thin', 'plot', 'strong', 'characters', 'make', 'work.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'either.This', 'movie', 'small', 'boy', 'carry', 'shoulders', 'commendable', 'job', 'when', 'supporting', 'cast', 'bunch', 'dysfunctional', 'monsters', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'hope', 'for.I', 'was', 'bored', '20', 'minutes', 'occasionally', 'finding', 'awe', 'what', 'was', 'watching', 'most', 'rest', 'it.Movie', 'three', 'stars', 'random', 'series', 'moments', 'film.Some', 'one', 'one', 'interactions', 'Max', 'two', 'main', 'monsters', 'were', 'touching.For', 'example', 'scene', 'cave', 'when', 'Carol', 'max', 'model', 'city.I', 'also', 'tended', 'enjoy', 'scenes', 'Max', 'KW.And', 'there', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'sail', 'where', 'up', 'story', 'entertain', 'mom', 'bouts', 'control', 'destructive', 'behaviour', 'brief', 'moments', 'really', 'touched', 'stood', 'out', 'mostly', 'boring', 'beautiful', 'movie']",Where the Wild Things Are

Guy""","[7, 14]","Taking a beloved 48-page childrens' picture bookWhere the Wild Things Areand turning it into a full-length motion picture has got to be a daunting task, but the writers and producers of WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE have answered the call with grace and gusto.  Using the Caldecott Award-winning book as a springboard, the audience is launched into the alternate reality of a child's imagination with all the hopes and fears that reside there.Max is an unruly child.  He chases his dog around the house.  He starts snow-ball fights.  When things don't work out his way, he vandalizes his sister's room.  Don't write him off as your typical one-dimensional Hollywood problem child, however.  Director Spike Jonze deftly shows us that Max's life is full of loneliness and disappointment, and we can instantly empathize with his resentments and even some of his acting out becomes understandable.  He doesn't have alot of friends.  His teenage sister tries to avoid him.  He even feels his place in his single mother's heart might be in jeopardy as she is being pursued by a suitor.  All of this culminates in a moment of extreme frustration where Max runs out of the house and straight into dream, where he meets up with some kindred Wild Things.This is where the screen-writing's imagination team really took flight.  Each of the monsters acts out a different part of Max's innermost self, but they do it in a seamless, colorful way, with a great deal of playful pile-ons (literal and figurative).  There's a passionate and impulsive one, a doubtful one, a painfully insecure one, an unconditionally loving one, a reasonable one, etc...  These metaphors will fly straight over the little movie-goers' heads, but many parents will be rubbing their chins and nodding appreciatively.  The Wild Things play, fight, and work together while helping Max work through some of childhood's toughest challenges.  The script is clever enough that none of this comes off as heavy-handed, and in fact, the dialogue is very sharp, insightful, and at times down-right playful.Young actor Max Records does a fantastic job channelling the complicated and conflicted character of Max, and does so playing opposite some truly enchanting creations in the Wild Things.  They, of course, will be the stars of the show for almost everyone, and are fantastically rendered.  Whether they be puppets, CGI, or a combo platter, it doesn't matter.  They're beautiful.  They're endlessly expressive.  They're a joy to watch, and I look forward to a second viewing to see the delightful details that I probably missed.At 101 mintues, not all of which is action-based like many ""kids"" movies, I heard a lot of little bottoms getting restless throughout the theater.  Additionally, there are a couple of legitimately scary moments (one, suprisingly at the title screen, when Max is chasing his dog around the house, and the other when he first meets the Wild Things and they surround him, threatening to eat him) where more tender viewers might appreciate a fore-warning.  The Wild Things are also very rough-and-tumble, like 10-foot-tall 5-year-olds who love to wrestle, and that'll probably widen some little eyes.  Outside of that, I didn't notice any real objectionable material.With such good story-telling and eye-popping visuals, it's unfair to label WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE as a ""kids"" movie.  I believe most adults will enjoy it at least as much as their miniature companions, if not quite a bit more so.  While the kids probably won't catch onto the complexity of the ""lessons"", they'll certainly catch the spirit of the film.This film comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for fans of fantastic films who wish to be transported away for a while and not have to leave their thinking caps at home.

1201538,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B001HN699A,Poor Napoleon,"[6, 9]","Spike Jonze filmed version of ""Where the Wild Things Are"" might be one of the strangest adaptations from a book (well, aside from Jonze's own ""Adaptation), but it also might be the most appropriate one.  The first thing a viewer needs to understand is that Jonze had the difficult task of adapting a very short children's book into a full length feature.  He could've very easily gone the route of Jumanji and create a film full of nonsensical action to expand the film or create a film like ""The Polar Express"" that does so little to expand the narrative that the film's success must rest on the shoulders of mindblowing visuals.  Jonze pitches from left field, however, producing a film that is a visual feast and an incredibly unique take on the children's classic.""Where the Wild Things Are"" contains all the elements of the book.  The book, for all its innocence, deals with imagination as a form of escapism.  From a child development perspective, it deals with a child looking for ways he can make sense and control his life in a world where he may feel he has no control.  This seems to me what Jonze is going with, as he takes the concept of Max being king a little further.  He expands on the characters of the wild things.  Very soon, as the characters grow, they seem to be nothing more than extensions of internal conflicts of Max in the real world.  While never directly stated, how Max learns to tame the wild things in this world, he may be able to tame the wild thing in himself.  Yes, that's a rather obvious theme, but I can't help but note how Jonze pinned it down so well with how he crafted the scenes in this film!He wisely does something with the characters in the conversations in this film.  It's clearly a child's world.  The wild things talk like children.  The squabbles, conflicts, and understanding of the world are very much those of a child.  There are touching scenes like when Max is walking with one of the wild things, explaining how the sun will die and the creature explains his concept of the world, noting tha the sun is small and that they're big.  Yet for some reason, it bothers him, just as it seemed to bother Max in the real world.  Scenes like this are touching.  Jonze clearly has a grasp with his inner child.The film, of course, is also a feast for the eyes.  It's a blend of classical muppetry magic, courtesy of Jim Henson's creature show, and a little CGI.  The mix is just right, making Max look like he fits in with these monsters, while not going overboard with CGI affects, thus creating a very authentic world.  The sets are nice, especially the model city Carol, one of the wild things envisions and they try to construct.  While praises go out this year for Avatar's use of CGI, it's films like this that really keep us believing, as the world doesn't look like it's been crafted copletely by a computer.  I love how the characters are lovingly crafted from Sendak's creations.  A lot of heart went into this.The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 is that I can't quite identify who this is for.  I think adults will get it and kids will enjoy wild rumpus and the wild things, but this is actually a quite psychologically complex film.  It doesn't contain the usual conflicts you find in a family film, and it won't take parents long to identify the complexities of Max's world.  The boy, feeling neglected and ignored, is clearly dealing with his issues at home and Jonze never makes any attempt to guise this.  The film is very poignant and at times quite sad and touching.  Kids might not like the pacing and lack of a traditional narrative.  That by no means says the movie's bad, but it's very difficult to gauge the audience for this film.Aside from a gripe about the intended audience, this is a great adaptation of a classic book, retaining the elements that made the book so memorable, yet stands on its own two feet as well.  I would reccomend going in not expecting a simple fun ride.  Nevertheless, the film is a fun experience.  Adults will come out feeling touched, while children at the right age should quickly identify with Max and appreciate the fun of the wild things.",4,Uniqe adaptation of a classic,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,4152,"['Spike', 'Jonze', 'filmed', 'version', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'strangest', 'adaptations', 'book', 'well', 'aside', 'Jonze', 'own', 'Adaptation', 'also', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'appropriate', 'one', 'first', 'thing', 'viewer', 'understand', 'Jonze', 'had', 'difficult', 'task', 'adapting', 'very', 'short', 'children', 'book', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'could', ""'ve"", 'very', 'easily', 'gone', 'route', 'Jumanji', 'create', 'film', 'full', 'nonsensical', 'action', 'expand', 'film', 'create', 'film', 'Polar', 'Express', 'so', 'little', 'expand', 'narrative', 'film', 'success', 'must', 'rest', 'shoulders', 'mindblowing', 'visuals', 'Jonze', 'pitches', 'left', 'field', 'however', 'producing', 'film', 'visual', 'feast', 'incredibly', 'unique', 'take', 'children', 'classic', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'elements', 'book', 'book', 'innocence', 'deals', 'imagination', 'form', 'escapism', 'child', 'development', 'perspective', 'child', 'looking', 'ways', 'can', 'make', 'sense', 'control', 'life', 'world', 'where', 'may', 'feel', 'control', 'what', 'Jonze', 'going', 'concept', 'Max', 'being', 'king', 'little', 'further', 'characters', 'wild', 'things', 'Very', 'soon', 'characters', 'grow', 'seem', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'extensions', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'Max', 'real', 'world', 'never', 'directly', 'stated', 'how', 'Max', 'tame', 'wild', 'things', 'world', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'tame', 'wild', 'thing', 'Yes', 'rather', 'obvious', 'theme', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'note', 'how', 'Jonze', 'pinned', 'down', 'so', 'well', 'how', 'crafted', 'scenes', 'film', 'wisely', 'something', 'characters', 'conversations', 'film', 'clearly', 'child', 'world', 'wild', 'things', 'talk', 'children', 'squabbles', 'conflicts', 'understanding', 'world', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'child', 'are', 'touching', 'scenes', 'when', 'Max', 'walking', 'one', 'wild', 'things', 'explaining', 'how', 'sun', 'will', 'die', 'creature', 'concept', 'world', 'noting', 'sun', 'small', ""'re"", 'big', 'reason', 'just', 'seemed', 'bother', 'Max', 'real', 'world', 'Scenes', 'are', 'touching', 'Jonze', 'clearly', 'grasp', 'inner', 'child.The', 'film', 'course', 'also', 'feast', 'eyes', 'blend', 'classical', 'muppetry', 'magic', 'courtesy', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'creature', 'show', 'little', 'CGI', 'mix', 'just', 'right', 'making', 'Max', 'look', 'monsters', 'not', 'going', 'CGI', 'affects', 'thus', 'creating', 'very', 'authentic', 'world', 'sets', 'are', 'nice', 'especially', 'model', 'city', 'Carol', 'one', 'wild', 'things', 'envisions', 'try', 'construct', 'praises', 'go', 'out', 'year', 'Avatar', 'use', 'CGI', 'films', 'really', 'keep', 'believing', 'world', ""n't"", 'look', 'been', 'crafted', 'copletely', 'computer', 'love', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'lovingly', 'crafted', 'Sendak', 'creations', 'lot', 'heart', 'went', 'this.The', 'only', 'thing', 'giving', '5', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'identify', 'who', 'think', 'adults', 'will', 'get', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'wild', 'rumpus', 'wild', 'things', 'actually', 'quite', 'psychologically', 'complex', 'film', ""n't"", 'contain', 'usual', 'conflicts', 'find', 'family', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'parents', 'long', 'identify', 'complexities', 'Max', 'world', 'boy', 'feeling', 'neglected', 'ignored', 'clearly', 'dealing', 'issues', 'home', 'Jonze', 'never', 'attempt', 'guise', 'film', 'very', 'poignant', 'times', 'quite', 'sad', 'touching', 'Kids', 'might', 'not', 'pacing', 'lack', 'traditional', 'narrative', 'means', 'movie', 'bad', 'very', 'difficult', 'gauge', 'audience', 'film.Aside', 'gripe', 'intended', 'audience', 'great', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'book', 'retaining', 'elements', 'made', 'book', 'so', 'memorable', 'yet', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'well', 'would', 'reccomend', 'going', 'not', 'expecting', 'simple', 'fun', 'ride', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'fun', 'experience', 'Adults', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'feeling', 'touched', 'children', 'right', 'age', 'should', 'quickly', 'identify', 'Max', 'appreciate', 'fun', 'wild', 'things']",Where the Wild Things Are

Each time I saw the trailer, i had hopes of it being an amazing, beautiful film, but I also saw the possibility for the movie being terrible.  (really giant puppets that talk??  one of them being Kevin's Mom from Home alone?!)i was worried the giant puppets, the live action, the voices would be too distracting, that they would ruin the story and the suspension of disbelief.But they didn't.This is a beautiful film.  simple, complex, subtle...  it follows the book - Max gets in trouble, and gets sent to his rook without dinner, and sails away to the land of where the Wild Things are, and becomes their king. eventually he goes home to find dinner waiting for him.the film is true to the book, while adding some easily believed touches to add authenticity and depth.The actor who portrays Max (Max Records) is amazing.  just fantastic.  there is no one more perfect for Max than this kid.The Wild things are also beautiful and terrible, and the voices are perfect, though it took me a second to get past Kevin's Mom (catherine O' hara) because she is so recognizable to me.  some of the voices will sound familiar though they don't stick out enough to be distracting.the soundtrack is great.  cinematogrphy, images, it's just realy beautiful to look at.i dont know if this was marketed as a children's film as it is based on a children's book.  that is my only question.

I was enjoying looking at it; it's a very breathtakingly and gorgeously shot film, and Jonze has a great eye for a beautiful shot, as this film had many of them. But was I enjoying watching a kids movie where everyone one monent hated each other then suddenly loved each other?Parents will tell me ""It's a kids movie"", I'm sure. And yes I'm aware of that. But is is really a kids' movie? There were scenes that even I found disturbing. Say for example, Ira, the one Max has a lot to do with, goes ballistic when night falls and the sky is dark. He believes, due to a comment made to him from earlier in the movie by Max that the sun will die. Do kids really need to see this? Guaranteed if I was about 8, that scene would have been nightmare fuel for me.I'm also anxiously awaiting hipsters/indie/arthouse crowd people to comment on my review and tell me that I don't get it. No, actually, I do get it. This film is about Max growing up. ""The Wild Things"", in all moods, represent the troubles of growing up. But keep in mind, did Maurice Sendak have that in mind when he wrote the story? Quite clearly the answer is no. The intention was a nice little story that even us adults could relate to, about the ""wild thing"" in all of us. Or maybe you guys are somehow right that I ""just don't get it"", that is, get how anyone could really enjoy this film from a narrative POV.Like I said, Jonze created a film that's pretty to look at. The special effects with the wild things were amazing. I couldn't tell if it was CG or puppets that were used. They really are flawless and hard to take you eyes off of. There are some funny scenes. I thought the two owls were hilarious- especially Max's reaction. And some of the things Max said (FEED ME WOMAN!!! in a great reference to Little Shop of Horrors) made us laugh. But this film was hard to watch somehow knowing the kid made things only worse. See that's why I didn't enjoy this movie. When Max arrives, things somehow go from bad to worse. We're forced to watch these cute creatures eventually go crazy and pretty much hate each other near the end. Then all of a sudden he leaves and they miss him despite the fact things went from bad to worse because of him!!!In short, I liked LOOKING at this pretty melange of images. But I didn't enjoy WATCHING this ugly and depressing take on a 9 sentence story. If you like films that are pretty, watch this, but if you like watching films with a good story, with characters that are likeable and conflicts you can care for, this film somehow just isn't it.",3,Where the Bi-polar Things Are,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,2680,"['halfway', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'take', '9', 'line', 'book', 'was', 'questioning', 'myself', 'was', '*really*', 'enjoying', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'enjoying', 'looking', 'very', 'breathtakingly', 'gorgeously', 'shot', 'film', 'Jonze', 'great', 'eye', 'beautiful', 'shot', 'film', 'had', 'many', 'was', 'enjoying', 'watching', 'kids', 'movie', 'where', 'everyone', 'one', 'monent', 'hated', 'other', 'then', 'suddenly', 'loved', 'other', 'Parents', 'will', 'tell', 'kids', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'yes', ""'m"", 'aware', 'really', 'kids', 'movie', 'were', 'scenes', 'even', 'found', 'disturbing', 'Say', 'example', 'Ira', 'one', 'Max', 'lot', 'do', 'ballistic', 'when', 'night', 'sky', 'dark', 'due', 'comment', 'made', 'earlier', 'movie', 'Max', 'sun', 'will', 'die', 'Do', 'kids', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'Guaranteed', 'was', 'about', '8', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nightmare', 'fuel', 'me.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'hipsters/indie/arthouse', 'crowd', 'people', 'comment', 'review', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'No', 'actually', 'do', 'get', 'film', 'Max', 'growing', 'up', 'Wild', 'Things', 'moods', 'represent', 'troubles', 'growing', 'up', 'keep', 'mind', 'did', 'Maurice', 'Sendak', 'have', 'that', 'mind', 'when', 'wrote', 'story', 'Quite', 'clearly', 'answer', 'intention', 'was', 'nice', 'little', 'story', 'even', 'adults', 'could', 'relate', 'wild', 'thing', 'maybe', 'guys', 'are', 'somehow', 'right', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'get', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'really', 'enjoy', 'film', 'narrative', 'POV.Like', 'said', 'Jonze', 'created', 'film', 'pretty', 'look', 'special', 'effects', 'wild', 'things', 'were', 'amazing', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'CG', 'puppets', 'were', 'used', 'really', 'are', 'flawless', 'hard', 'take', 'eyes', 'are', 'funny', 'scenes', 'thought', 'two', 'owls', 'were', 'hilarious-', 'especially', 'Max', 'reaction', 'things', 'Max', 'said', 'FEED', 'ME', 'WOMAN', 'great', 'reference', 'Little', 'Shop', 'Horrors', 'made', 'laugh', 'film', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'somehow', 'knowing', 'kid', 'made', 'things', 'only', 'worse', 'See', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'When', 'Max', 'things', 'somehow', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', ""'re"", 'forced', 'watch', 'cute', 'creatures', 'eventually', 'go', 'crazy', 'pretty', 'much', 'hate', 'other', 'end', 'Then', 'sudden', 'miss', 'fact', 'things', 'went', 'bad', 'worse', 'short', 'liked', 'LOOKING', 'pretty', 'melange', 'images', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'WATCHING', 'ugly', 'depressing', 'take', '9', 'sentence', 'story', 'like', 'films', 'are', 'pretty', 'watch', 'like', 'watching', 'films', 'good', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'conflicts', 'can', 'care', 'film', 'somehow', 'just', ""n't""]",Where the Wild Things Are
1201549,ABFQUOV57SWOR,B001HN699A,robb1138,"[2, 4]","""Let the Rumpus begin!"" says Max, our main character of the film adaptation of Maurice Sendak's children's book, ""Where the Wild Things Are."" The book, written in 1963 comprises no more than 25 pages of, illustrations, and sparse dialog. The star of this not-quite-a-children's-story is actor Max Records, who ironically plays, ""Max."" Also starring are the voices of James Gandolfini, Forest Whitaker, Catherine O'Hara, and Chris Cooper to name the most prominent. My curiosity was how are the filmmakers going to make this very short adventure tale into a feature length film? The Answers: Using the book as an outline, director Spike Jonze, in collaboration with the Maurice Sendak, created a psychological profile of an ignored, temperamental, imaginative, and lonely little 10-year-old boy. I suppose you could see this movie as the, ""author's cut"" of Sendak's original story.The time is now, the place, could be anywhere, Max opens a door with the key of imagination... Well, you get my drift.So it is in the movie, as it is in the book. Max, ignored by his older sister and his mother, seeks attention by throwing temper tantrums. After starting and losing a snowball fight, which he starts, Max goes into his sister's room and destroys her belongings. Later Max dons a wolf costume and while his mother's boyfriend is over, Max jumps onto the table, embarrassing his mother, and demands, ""Feed me, woman!"" During a short scuffle that follows, Max bites his mom, who declares him, ""out of control."" Running off into the night and across the street to a small lake, Max sets sail to the land where the wild things are. Coming to the island, he discovers giant creatures that seem remarkably similar to the stuffed animals in Max's room. The creatures are destroying mound-like dwellings and Max, happily joins in the destruction. Turning on Max, the outsider, the creatures plan on eating Max, but Max bluffs his way out by, declaring himself their king. The group of ""Wild Things,"" Introduce them self to Max starting with Carol, a horned, hairy, and tall creature seems to be the de facto leader of the group, voiced by James Gandolfini. Carol is a lot like Max in that he is temperamental, moody and his  need to have his group stay together and live happily is his driving force. Judith, voiced by Catherine O'Hara, is another large hairy creature, whose prominent feature is the horn on her nose and, her ""downer"" personality playing opposite to Carol's drive for happiness. Between Carol and Judith is KW, voiced by Lauren Ambrose, she has no horns, the loner of the group, and is happy to seek peace on her own. KW's wanting to be away from the group bothers Carol enormously. A reversal of roles takes place and Max is now in the adult position with these creatures are the children, with all the fears, insecurities, and immaturity of a 10 year old. If you watch this film carefully, you will notice that each of the characters represent people from Max's life. Too much psychology to go here, however, this movie plays on many levels. Some of those levels are hits and others are definite misses.One aspect of this film that I found intriguing is the musical score. Karen O and the Kids work hard to bring this movie to life, although the music is catchy, the length of the scenes tends to dampen the musical effect. The fort building scenes go on forever, once again, the music sets a mood, but the action does not carry the scene.The photography of the Australian countryside, although not breathtaking, is beautiful and so are the special effects. The suit costumes are a refreshing break from the film industry's addiction to CGI. Lance Acord and Spke Jonz, photographed the creatures in such a way that you feel their emotions, and you can empathize with them.I watched this movie after being told it was not actually a kid's movie. I was not sure what to expect. I think if this film were for children, it would have been better. I think that the biggest disappointment with this movie has nothing to do with the production values or the acting. What was a classic story of imagination and adventure, has become a deep reflection on a child's unhappiness and ultimately our unhappiness that we cannot resolve in finding that our supper is still hot when we return.",3,"The time is now, the place, could be anywhere, Max opens a door with the key of imagination...

notables as Catherine O'Hara,James Gandolfini,and Forest Whitaker,among others.It is a wonderful and enchanting tale of a young boy,whose precociousness and wild imagination lead him on a path to eventual self discovery and horizon broadening.The plot finds Max as an eight year old with a wild imagination who,like many other boys his age,lives in a self centric world of games and adventure.When Max plays,he plays hard.However when others not of his age do not play by the ""rules"",he cannot understand why and becomes angry and hurt.One instance involves him making an igloo.When his sisters friends come by to pick her up he decides to throw snowballs at them.When the going gets tough he retreats to his igloo,only to have them cave it in and ruin it.The final straw happens when his single mother is entertaining a boyfriend and she doesn't want to come to his room and play(on his command),like she normally would.He comes down to the kitchen,dressed in a wolf costume,and upset,proceeds to defy his mother.When he tries to run out the door she grabs him,and in the struggle he bites her.He finally runs out the door and into the nearby woods,screaming to get his frustrations out.Max spies a skiff by the waters edge and decides to take it out for a float.However the day turns into night and the next day again into night,far,far away from land.Just below the setting sun on the horizon, he spies an island,on which are burning fires in some woods.As he approaches the island he finds the waters treacherous and with a decided lack of beach,with lots of rocks.He makes it to shore,wet and dirty(still wearing his costume)and proceeds inland.There he discovers a race of big fantastical creatures,kind of like a cross between a sasquatch and and ogre.All of them talk,but one called Carol,seems to be kind of a kindred spirit.Carol is in the middle of destroying their living quarters(like giant bees nests),and when Carol's help from the others goes wanting,Max runs in to help him.Carol immediately likes Max's style,but Max soon runs afoul of some of the others.Max tells them not to eat him as he is a king from far away with tremendous powers.The creatures(seven in all)fall for Max's story and he is proclaimed king,crown and all.Things go along alright for the first while as he gets everyone in a playful and fun mood.One day Carol takes Max on a long hike,through forest and desert to his hideaway.There Carol had long ago built an imaginary world made of sticks.Max is so impressed that he decides it would be a good idea if everyone chipped in and brought Carol`s idea to life,but with embellishments.Everyone chips in and soon the project is seeing progress,but there are disharmonious feelings among some of the creatures,which Max tries to soothe but which seem to overtake his good efforts.With this in mind,Max devises a clod throwing `war` between opposite teams.At first everyone is enjoying themselves but things go awry when Carol`s girlfriend KW and he,have an argument and one of the others doesn`t want to play and gets hit with dirt when leaving.Max` s secret finally comes out and Carol finds out also.Carol is so mad he pulls the arm out of one of the others and Max runs for his life.He bumps into KW,who puts him in her stomach to hide him.Carol and KW cannot resolve their differences and Carol storms off,with KW deciding to leave due to Carols disposition.Max thinks and decides to head back home.The creatures all follow Max down to his skiff and he says a heartfelt goodbye to his family of `friends`.Carol,who was pouting,runs back to the shore,but is not in time to hug him.Instead Carol starts howling,and the others chime in.Max finds his way home and the film ends as he sits eating supper,as his tired mother goes to sleep at the table.Wild Things is an allegorical take on Max`s life,and life and society in general;with each creature representing either a part of Max himself,or a part of his world and/or society,as a whole.Max eventually sees alot of himself in Carol,who doesn`t get why things do not go a certain way or why others won`t do things his way.As a result come the tantrums and bad behaviour.His imaginary reign as king also gives Max a valuable lesson,in that,among other things,everyone is an individual and you cannot please everyone at the same time.In other words,it`s darn hard being a king,even a pretend one.And of course there is that age old lesson,well illustrated in the Wizard of Oz that,there is no place like home.Or like the song Back in your own Backyard,which tells you that everything you could ever want is right there in front of you;`You can see castles in Spain,though your window pane...``.Max Reynolds does a good job as the central character and the costumes and sets are wonderfully done and real looking.Lastly,the voice work is superb by all involved.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 is is generally clear and crisp. Extras include commentary and four shorts.All in all an enchanting film for the whole family by director Spike Jonze(I doubt if the Spike Jones estate takes too kindly to the resemblance,just wondering).The island,full of fantastical creatures,comes vividly to life because of the quality of the costumes and sets.Much of the younger set won`t get the allegorical context of much of what is going on,but they don`t have to.There`s something in it for people of all ages.Recommended.",4,A pleasing adaption of the original book,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,5555,"['Where', 'Wild', 'Things',

1201551,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001HN699A,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 7]","Where the Wild Things Are (Spike Jonze, 2009)This is another of those movies that I went to see not long after it came out, and here I am months later still trying to find the proper words to review it. It probably doesn't help that I was the only member of the group I went to see it with who has anything at all positive to say about it; when A. O. Scott tabbed it as one of the best movies of the decade on At the Movies (which happened this weekend, as I write this), there was a good deal of hooting and hollering in the room. (For the record, At the Movies, I wish you'd bring back Ben and Ben. I'd imagine we'd be getting much more interesting best-of-the-decade lists from them then we are from the rather staid team of Scott and Phillips; have you read Scott's Best DVDs You've Never Seen book? Yeah, you've seen them all, probably.) I didn't find it nearly as bad as those I went with; while the movie does have its share of problems, and they are many, I did find it an interesting exploration of what it means to be human, and to be a part of a family, and for that, at least, I do think it's worthwhile.Max (The Brothers Bloom's Max Record) is a kid who doesn't have all that many friends. Not any at all, it seems, given the movie's opening scenes. After a fight with his mother (Jonze regular Catherine Keener), Max runs away to a world where monsters are real. After a conversation with the monsters, Max is named their king, and sets about remaking the tribe in his own image. (Not that that's hard; Jonze's monsters are all parts of Max's personality.) Things go well for a while, but inevitably, given Max's lack of leadership skills, the tribe's morale begins the break down, leaving them worse off than they were before Max's arrival. Can Max manage to bring the tribe together again before the damage becomes irrevocable?The most impressive thing about the movie, to me, was the phenomenal cast put together to play the monsters. Forest Whitaker, Lauren Ambrose, Catherine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Paul Dano, Chris Cooper, and Michael Berry Jr. are running around under those suits. That's a pretty fine cast by anyone's standards, and thanks to the incredible CGI in the movie, the personalities of the actors really do come out. The downside is that they're hobbled by a script composed in the main by the overrated and entirely unfunny Dave Eggers, whose involvement in the movie did just what I feared it would do; while there are a few scenes of great tenderness, the humorous bits fall flat (I saw it in a packed theater, and there was nary a laugh from the crowd throughout the film) and most of the characters, including Max, remain firmly undeveloped. One would expect, given that this is Max's story, that he would in some way grow during the film; this never happens. Some of the monsters do get developed (especially the Gandolfini-voiced Carol, who is the closest of the bunch to Max's personality), but not nearly all of them; some seem almost as if they're more backdrop than anything (the Whitaker-voiced Ira, who seems to be in the film solely for the quirkiness factor of his character) or just to advance the plot (Judith, voiced by O'Hara).It's not a bad little movie, but it could have been so much more than it is. ** ",3,A lot of potential that doesn't get filled.,1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,3263,"['Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'Spike', 'Jonze', '2009', 'movies', 'went', 'see', 'not', 'long', 'came', 'out', 'here', 'am', 'months', 'later', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'proper', 'words', 'review', 'probably', ""n't"", 'help', 'was', 'only', 'member', 'group', 'went', 'see', 'who', 'anything', 'positive', 'say', 'when', 'A.', 'O.', 'Scott', 'tabbed', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'decade', 'Movies', 'happened', 'weekend', 'write', 'was', 'good', 'deal', 'hooting', 'hollering', 'room', 'record', 'Movies', 'wish', ""'d"", 'bring', 'back', 'Ben', 'Ben', ""'d"", 'imagine', ""'d"", 'be', 'getting', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'best-of-the-decade', 'lists', 'then', 'are', 'rather', 'staid', 'team', 'Scott', 'Phillips', 'have', 'read', 'Scott', 'Best', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'Never', 'Seen', 'book', 'Yeah', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'went', 'movie', 'have', 'share', 'problems', 'are', 'many', 'did', 'find', 'interesting', 'exploration', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'be', 'part', 'family', 'least', 'do', 'think', 'worthwhile.Max', 'Brothers', 'Bloom', 'Max', 'Record', 'kid', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'friends', 'Not', 'given', 'movie', 'opening', 'scenes', 'fight', 'mother', 'Jonze', 'regular', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Max', 'away', 'world', 'where', 'monsters', 'are', 'real', 'conversation', 'monsters', 'Max', 'named', 'king', 'sets', 'remaking', 'tribe', 'own', 'image', 'Not', 'hard', 'Jonze', 'monsters', 'are', 'parts', 'Max', 'personality', 'Things', 'go', 'well', 'while', 'inevitably', 'given', 'Max', 'lack', 'leadership', 'skills', 'tribe', 'morale', 'break', 'down', 'leaving', 'worse', 'off', 'were', 'Max', 'arrival', 'Can', 'Max', 'manage', 'bring', 'tribe', 'together', 'again', 'damage', 'irrevocable', 'most', 'impressive', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'cast', 'put', 'together', 'play', 'monsters', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Michael', 'Berry', 'Jr.', 'are', 'running', 'around', 'suits', 'pretty', 'fine', 'cast', 'anyone', 'standards', 'thanks', 'incredible', 'CGI', 'movie', 'personalities', 'actors', 'really', 'do', 'come', 'out', 'downside', ""'re"", 'hobbled', 'script', 'composed', 'main', 'overrated', 'entirely', 'unfunny', 'Dave', 'Eggers', 'involvement', 'movie', 'did', 'just', 'what', 'feared', 'would', 'do', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'great', 'tenderness', 'humorous', 'bits', 'fall', 'flat', 'saw', 'packed', 'theater', 'there', 'was', 'nary', 'laugh', 'crowd', 'film', 'most', 'characters', 'including', 'Max', 'remain', 'firmly', 'undeveloped', 'One', 'would', 'expect', 'given', 'Max', 'story', 'would', 'way', 'grow', 'film', 'never', 'monsters', 'do', 'get', 'developed', 'especially', 'Gandolfini-voiced', 'Carol', 'who', 'closest', 'bunch', 'Max', 'personality', 'not', 'nearly', 'seem', 'almost', ""'re"", 'more', 'backdrop', 'anything', 'Whitaker-voiced', 'Ira', 'who', 'be', 'film', 'solely', 'quirkiness', 'factor', 'character', 'just', 'advance', 'plot', 'Judith', 'voiced', ""O'Hara"", '.It', 'not', 'bad', 'little', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', '**']",Where the Wild Things Are

Although I can't point myself out in the crowd, even during those camera shots, I was there and I recognized one of the people in the audience.  This was a guy who I remember was in the front row, pretty close to the center, and he had an Yngwie Malmsteen shirt.Okay, about the DVD.  There were a few seconds of talking edited out here and there, and I was a bit disappointed about that, but it wasn't really that big a deal.  I remember him performing another song during the encore just before ""Liberty,"" but it's either missing from the DVD or I'm just remembering incorrectly.  I also assumed that they didn't film his front act's performance, but his front act came out during the show and played lap steel for a couple of tunes.  For the viewer watching the show on DVD, they see a special guest, for the people who were there, it felt kind of like a friend was coming onto the stage.This concert shows Steve Vai's talent as a guitar player, but I have to give just as much recognition to his amazing band.  Steve Vai has said that he can't spend more than a few years with one band at a time.  I was expecting to see Billy Sheehan on bass that night, but what I got was something very different.  Say goodbye to the quadruple guitar playing and hello to a mix of violin and guitar.  Alex DePue had an electric violin strapped around him, which was probably good for switching between keyboard and violin.  Ann Marie Calhoun was an amazing violinist, with a bit more of a traditional classical sort of style, and... I don't want to say anything about how she looked.  Bryan Beller was a great bass player, and was a much better choice for this band than Billy Sheehan.  Jeremy Colson had played drums for Steve Vai with the previous band, and of all of the drummers that Steve Vai had played with, Jeremy Colson probably has the most rock in his playing.Dave Weiner has returned, yet again, because he's such a help for Steve Vai.  When your first gig with Steve Vai is doing the tour where Alive in an Ultra World was recorded, you have a lot of weight on your shoulders.  When you're mentioned as more important to the recording than the artist who released it, by the artist himself, I'm not sure if the artist will want to get rid of you.Except for Bryan Beller, each artist gets their own moment in the spotlight with Steve Vai himself being off the stage.  Dave Weiner's tune was pretty good.  I can say watch out Steve.  Alex DePue and Ann Marie Calhoun did a duet that included ""Eugene's Trick Bag.""

1201554,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001HN699A,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","Childhood fantasy is all about giving kids power in a world where they essentially have no power.  And if that means having to create an entirely new world where that can happen, then so be it.Maurice Cendak's 1963 ""Where the Wild Things Are"" provides just such a world for Max (Max Records), a nine-year-old boy whose divorced mother (Catherine Keener) is too preoccupied with getting food on the table to give him the attention he deserves and whose older sister suddenly doesn`t have the time or inclination to play with her little brother much anymore.  One night, in a fit of rage, Max runs away from home, clad in a wolf costume he wears for every occasion; in his flight, he stumbles upon a boat on a nearby shore and sails it away to a wooded isle populated by an assortment of strange creatures whose situations and conditions eerily parallel his own (they too are rambunctious, temperamental and lonely).  Soon they've crowned him king of the island and together they play and romp through the forest, bonding, bickering, knocking down trees, building a fort, and teaching one another lessons about life and friendship and what it means to have power over others.  (James Gandolfini, Lauren Ambrose, Chris Cooper, Paul Dano, Catherine O'Hara and Forest Whitaker provide the voices for the creatures).First, a somewhat flippant point:  though I appreciate the fact that the filmmakers opted to go old-school and not rely so heavily on CGI for their special effects, that doesn't excuse the fact that the creatures on the island look for all the world like only slightly more evolved descendants of H.R. Pufnstuf (or maybe the Banana Splits).That being said, however, there is much to recommend in ""Where the Wild Things Are,"" even though I'm fully aware that it will surely not be everyone's cup of tea.Indeed, with its deep reflections into the human condition, its drab and rather colorless setting (this is no rainbow-hued, Technicolor Oz), its unfrenetic pacing and lack of whiz-bang special effects, ""Where the Wild Things Are"" may well be the first ""art"" movie ever designed primarily with children in mind - which, ironically, may actually make it less appealing to the kids than to the adults in the audience.  Perhaps because the creatures themselves seem so interchangeable with one another, it's often difficult to fully comprehend the dynamics taking place within the group itself.  And without this understanding, the deeper themes of friendship, prejudice, jealousy, hurt feelings, truth, deception, warfare, etc., that are playing themselves out in the story tend to get lost in the shuffle.Yet, for all the reservations one might have about the movie, ""Where the Wild Things Are"" eventually wins its audience over with its ultra-stylish direction by Spike Jonze (who co-wrote the screenplay with Dave Eggers), its strikingly poetic imagery and visuals (kudos to cinematographer Lance Acord and production designer K.K. Barrett), and its refusal to talk down to it audience.  And the last half hour or so of the film is so artistically fine and pure that it makes any quibbles one might have had about earlier portions of the movie seem like mere nitpicking when all is said and done.",4,uneven but generally rewarding children's fantasy,1270598400,"04 7, 2010",2010,3208,"['Childhood', 'fantasy', 'giving', 'kids', 'power', 'world', 'where', 'essentially', 'have', 'power', 'having', 'create', 'entirely', 'new', 'world', 'where', 'can', 'happen', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'it.Maurice', 'Cendak', '1963', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'just', 'world', 'Max', 'Max', 'Records', 'nine-year-old', 'boy', 'divorced', 'mother', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'too', 'preoccupied', 'getting', 'food', 'table', 'give', 'attention', 'older', 'sister', 'suddenly', 't', 'have', 'time', 'inclination', 'play', 'little', 'brother', 'much', 'anymore', 'One', 'night', 'fit', 'rage', 'Max', 'away', 'home', 'clad', 'wolf', 'costume', 'occasion', 'flight', 'boat', 'nearby', 'shore', 'away', 'wooded', 'isle', 'populated', 'assortment', 'strange', 'creatures', 'situations', 'conditions', 'eerily', 'parallel', 'own', 'too', 'are', 'rambunctious', 'temperamental', 'lonely', 'Soon', ""'ve"", 'crowned', 'king', 'island', 'together', 'play', 'romp', 'forest', 'bonding', 'bickering', 'knocking', 'down', 'trees', 'building', 'fort', 'teaching', 'one', 'lessons', 'life', 'friendship', 'what', 'have', 'power', 'others', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'provide', 'voices', 'creatures', '.First', 'somewhat', 'flippant', 'point', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'filmmakers', 'opted', 'go', 'old-school', 'not', 'rely', 'so', 'heavily', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'fact', 'creatures', 'island', 'look', 'world', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'evolved', 'descendants', 'H.R', 'Pufnstuf', 'maybe', 'Banana', 'Splits', 'being', 'said', 'however', 'much', 'recommend', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'even', ""'m"", 'fully', 'aware', 'will', 'surely', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea.Indeed', 'deep', 'reflections', 'human', 'condition', 'drab', 'rather', 'colorless', 'setting', 'rainbow-hued', 'Technicolor', 'Oz', 'unfrenetic', 'pacing', 'lack', 'whiz-bang', 'special', 'effects', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'first', 'art', 'movie', 'ever', 'designed', 'primarily', 'children', 'mind', 'ironically', 'may', 'actually', 'make', 'less', 'appealing', 'kids', 'adults', 'audience', 'Perhaps', 'creatures', 'seem', 'so', 'interchangeable', 'one', 'often', 'difficult', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'dynamics', 'taking', 'place', 'group', 'understanding', 'deeper', 'themes', 'friendship', 'prejudice', 'jealousy', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'truth', 'deception', 'warfare', 'etc.', 'are', 'playing', 'story', 'tend', 'get', 'lost', 'shuffle.Yet', 'reservations', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'movie', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'eventually', 'audience', 'ultra-stylish', 'direction', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Dave', 'Eggers', 'strikingly', 'poetic', 'imagery', 'visuals', 'kudos', 'cinematographer', 'Lance', 'Acord', 'production', 'designer', 'K.K', 'Barrett', 'refusal', 'talk', 'audience', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'film', 'so', 'artistically', 'fine', 'pure', 'quibbles', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'earlier', 'portions', 'movie', 'seem', 'mere', 'nitpicking', 'when', 'said', 'done']",Where the Wild Things Are

I tend to like more blues based music whatever genre (hence the Bonamassa DVD) and have always thought Steve Vai to be one of the creme de la creme guitar player / musician / creator's out there.  For me I was never really into shred type guitar playing, but this is a whole different level.  I have known about Steve Vai since his Frank Zappa days but have never had any recordings of his in my own collection except for the Clapton Crossroads concert and watching him in the movie Crossroads guitar showdown with that kid playing the Telecaster.  So that makes me a nubie so to speak.  I play guitar and have read many articles about Vai and his gear etc. over the past 20+ years or so.  Previous post summarized maybe heavy metal Grateful Dead?  I am thinking more on the lines of John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu on steroids.  Whatever, it doesn't really matter.  Blah blah blah, I am running on here.Well this DVD shows just how talented this guy is from this concert date from 2 years ago.  Anyone who knows about Steve Vai has always known how talented he is and what he can bring.  The band members are absolutely amazingly talented with their own energy that they bring and would think Vai would have nothing less since he is the main guy.  I did not know that Steve sings and was kind of surprised at his decent vocal quality.Already having stated his talent, Mr. Vai is really a great showmen with his humor and antics while playing which makes this DVD all the more fun and jaw dropping with mind boggling musical arrangements. I just love the two violins of Alex Depue and Ann Marie Calhoun that compliment so well.  Jeremy Colson the drummer is tireless and will totally blew you away.  This young man's energy is a force to be reckoned with.  Bryan Beller with his 5 string bass is so good along with second guitarist Dave Weiner playing a 7 string guitar which really adds that additional bottom chunk and gets to be spot lighted on his own.  Second guitarist is an oxymoron.  This guy is great!  Play this DVD or Blue-Ray, whatever you got loud.  Seeing is believing what musical human beings are capable of.

Less of a story than a series of weird, vaguely symbolic events contrived to make obvious observations (growing up can be tough, family is complicated) seem really deep and amazing, without actually having anything to say about them. It's not that impressive to point out things everyone has known for all of time (ever heard of the human condition?); you have to actually have something to say about them other than just pointing out that they exist.Really great character effects and all that, but in a bleak world that makes little sense and is going nowhere. So what's the deal with this movie? At least it ends. Nothing really happens that causes it. People just suddenly change their attitudes and it all just comes to an end. Nothing really happens plotwise. No one says or does anything significant or has any epiphanies beyond some vague and obvious rambling. But at least it ends.Just because you can't see the bottom of a pool doesn't mean it's bottomless. It might just be shallow and murky. A terrible movie for kids. Nothing to enjoy. So, really, it fails to capture the reality of childhood, and the fun of the book. Not that childhood is all joy, but it's also not all weird existential howling either. I wanted to like this movie. I really, really did. Even afterward, it took me a while to come to grips with the fact it was awful.

1201568,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,B001HN699A,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[2, 8]","Coming soon to DVD is the Spike Jonze film that divided both critics and audiences, Where The Wild Things Are. People seem to either love or hate this film. To me, this is understandable; however, I think that the films detractors are missing the point.This unconventional film tells the story of Max, who is the very definition of a wild child. He storms through the house in his wolf costume, demands orders from his mother, chases and violently tackles the dog, and trashes his sister's room after her older friends demolish his snow fort. It's obvious that his mother loves him. She gives him her undivided attention and attends to his needs. She is also in a serious dating relationship, something which leaves Max feeling confused and angry. It is on one of his mother's date nights that Max throws a fit which ends with him biting his mother. He bursts into tears, and flees out of the house, down the street, and into the deep, dark woods. After taking a moment to observe his surroundings, he finds a solitary sailboat stranded on the shore. He climbs on board, and sails away, drifting into the depths of his imagination. He arrives on a deserted island, inhabited by several monsters. These are the wild things, and at first, they haven't the faintest clue where Max came from. All they know is that they may want to eat him. Max eventually convinces them that he is a mighty warrior, and that he is their king and ruler. They give him a staff and a crown, and dub him King of the Wild Things. Max begins to live the life of a reckless beast, demolishing anything and everything in his path, participating in violent dirt clod wars, and building friendships with the timid, shy, and innocent monsters. Sure, they may look big and scary on the outside, but these wild things observe the world and make inquiries to their newfound leader with an almost childlike purity. The film itself is an exercise in incorruptibility, the simple joys of childhood, and the power of the imagination. The film takes a darker turn in the third act. Spike Jonze does not deviate from his usual style. The film takes a non-linear approach, and does not rely so much on plot or story. One of the best films of the year, Where the Wild Things Are is definitely worth a look.Rated PG for scary moments. 1 hour and 38 minutes.",5,Beautiful!,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,2314,"['Coming', 'soon', 'DVD', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'film', 'divided', 'critics', 'audiences', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'People', 'seem', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'understandable', 'however', 'think', 'films', 'detractors', 'are', 'missing', 'point.This', 'unconventional', 'film', 'story', 'Max', 'who', 'very', 'definition', 'wild', 'child', 'house', 'wolf', 'costume', 'orders', 'mother', 'chases', 'violently', 'dog', 'sister', 'room', 'older', 'friends', 'demolish', 'snow', 'fort', 'obvious', 'mother', 'undivided', 'attention', 'needs', 'also', 'serious', 'dating', 'relationship', 'something', 'Max', 'feeling', 'confused', 'angry', 'one', 'mother', 'date', 'nights', 'Max', 'fit', 'biting', 'mother', 'tears', 'house', 'street', 'deep', 'dark', 'woods', 'taking', 'moment', 'observe', 'surroundings', 'solitary', 'sailboat', 'stranded', 'shore', 'board', 'away', 'drifting', 'depths', 'imagination', 'deserted', 'island', 'inhabited', 'several', 'monsters', 'are', 'wild', 'things', 'first', 'have', ""n't"", 'faintest', 'clue', 'where', 'Max', 'came', 'know', 'may', 'want', 'eat', 'Max', 'eventually', 'mighty', 'warrior', 'king', 'ruler', 'give', 'staff', 'crown', 'dub', 'King', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Max', 'live', 'life', 'reckless', 'beast', 'demolishing', 'anything', 'everything', 'path', 'participating', 'violent', 'dirt', 'clod', 'wars', 'building', 'friendships', 'timid', 'shy', 'innocent', 'monsters', 'Sure', 'may', 'look', 'big', 'scary', 'outside', 'wild', 'things', 'observe', 'world', 'make', 'inquiries', 'newfound', 'leader', 'almost', 'childlike', 'purity', 'film', 'exercise', 'incorruptibility', 'simple', 'joys', 'childhood', 'power', 'imagination', 'film', 'darker', 'turn', 'third', 'act', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'not', 'deviate', 'usual', 'style', 'film', 'non-linear', 'approach', 'not', 'rely', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'story', 'One', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look.Rated', 'PG', 'scary', 'moments', '1', 'hour', '38', 'minutes']",Where the Wild Things Are

(another book which DEVASTATED me when i was a little girl)here is what i think. this film is an exploration of how children treat each other and how they are treated by adults. spike jonze is known for his alternating points of view, and sometimes the wild things and max interact like kids on a playground governing themselves, but most of the time the wild things are large , towering creatures, who loom over confused little max and talk about things he doesn't understand, vacillate wildly in their emotional state, treat him with inconsistent and unpredictable love, or ignore him, doing whatever they please, paying attention to him when they choose too. WHICH IS EXACTLY HOW ADULTS TREAT CHILDRENthere is an interesting thread about the K.W. ""wild thing"" character who has tumultuous relationship with the angry (yet sometimes gentle and talented) Carol ""wild thing."" their relationship is a prototype for an abusive mother-father dynamic. you have a ""mother-protector"" and a ""father/friend."" the ""mom"" keeps trying to leave the ""dad""  who is consumed by sorrow and  rage- he is miserable, misunderstood, and deeply unhappy. her attempts to leave serve to make him increasingly destructive and angry, which just makes her want to leave him even more, despite their profound love for each other and flashbacks depicting both reminiscing of  happier times. at 1 pt, K.W./""mom"" brings home some of her new owl friends, who can do nothing but squawk wordlessly and squirm under her heavy arms- drawing her much-desired and needed affection & focus away from max and carol. i saw these two as metaphors for younger siblings entering ""the nest""-another reviewer noted they could also be metaphors for what adult friends of parents seem like to kids... incomprehensible rivals for their parents' attention. there are oedipal overtones and an interesting ""birth imagery"" scene.the ""wild things"" themselves- with their growls and roars and dog-like sleep ""piles""- hearken back to an earlier evolutionary time, when man was less civilized and more an ""animal"" being. jonez uses them to comment on the hidden, oft-ignored animal nature inside us all.the dialogue is simple and without flourish, and i think dave eggers was really trying to capture how four and five year olds speak, very directly, with little room for deception or nuance. max and the wild things speak directly about exactly how they feel, trying to learn how to govern their feelings and protect themselves, much in the way children do.there is a joyless sorrow to this film- even when the wild things celebrate max's arrival to the island, there is always a menace and a fear permeating their fun. it mirrors the out of control world of the young human being , both an animal and a mental creature, both utterly dependent on others to sustain its life and yet possessed of it's own intense free will.it's very metaphoric and symbolic and not really for children, unless you are a depressed, preternaturally intelligent child growing up in a dysfunctional or fractured family or with a general sense of unease. then you'll love it.i'd also like to note the lack of CGI and wonderful sets and costumes and fantastic music make this artistically quite an enjoyable film, as does the absence of Disney grindingly cheerful, feel good rah-rah- ism and looking at childhood through some sort of ridiculous, distorted rose coloured lens. this is a real movie about a real child, giant jim henson puppets notwithstanding, and that child's very real emotional struggles.there's a lot going on in this movie.i enjoyed it. but bring some handkerchiefs!",4,don't forget your hankies and child psychology textbooks!,1258848000,"11

1201571,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,B001HN699A,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[4, 8]","In one way, adapting Where The Wild Things Are, the classic children's book, should have been easy - adults everywhere have vivid images of the amazing Wild Things, and designing clever suits in Hollywood could instantly bring them to life. But then again, there isn't much story to work with considering that this is only a 37-page book, of which 21 pages contain text (in some cases only phrases, not full sentences, the shortest of which being ""... and grew...""). Of course, there is an opportunity to explain a bit of back story - some reasons as to why, on that day, Max put on his wolf suit and got up to mischief of one kind and another.Greater mysteries arise when Max arrives on the island of the Wild Things and the movie swerves unmistakably into Dave Eggers territory, the author of the vain and preposterously-titled A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, who creates reindeer games for the film's vain and preposterous wild things to play. Sure, it's fun hearing the voice of Tony Soprano coming out of head Wild Thing Carol, but the kids won't get that, and I don't even think they'd enjoy this film since there's so little real fun in it. Halfway through the movie, you get the sinking feeling that it's going to be a dull flick, and the visual style, aptly described by Stephanie Zacharek of [...] as ""depressive and shaggy and tired"" means there's little to do after the film ends but turn the TV off and silently go of to sleep.Too bad it wasn't as fascinating as the trailer was, with its use of an Arcade Fire song that's not actually used in the movie.Many claim that this is not a movie for kids, others insist it is.  Results will vary here, but I can at least say that my eight-year-old, who I had read the book to when he was just a little kid, was excited about seeing the movie after he had seen the trailer, but quickly got bored and confused, and in the end didn't enjoy the movie.",2,"Boring, not for kids either",1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,1915,"['one', 'way', 'adapting', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'classic', 'children', 'book', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'adults', 'everywhere', 'have', 'vivid', 'images', 'amazing', 'Wild', 'Things', 'designing', 'clever', 'suits', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'instantly', 'bring', 'life', 'then', 'again', ""n't"", 'much', 'story', 'work', 'considering', 'only', '37-page', 'book', '21', 'pages', 'contain', 'text', 'cases', 'only', 'phrases', 'not', 'full', 'sentences', 'shortest', 'being', 'grew', 'course', 'opportunity', 'explain', 'bit', 'back', 'story', 'reasons', 'why', 'day', 'Max', 'put', 'wolf', 'suit', 'got', 'up', 'mischief', 'one', 'kind', 'another.Greater', 'mysteries', 'arise', 'when', 'Max', 'island', 'Wild', 'Things', 'movie', 'unmistakably', 'Dave', 'Eggers', 'territory', 'author', 'vain', 'preposterously-titled', 'A', 'Heartbreaking', 'Work', 'Staggering', 'Genius', 'who', 'reindeer', 'games', 'film', 'vain', 'preposterous', 'wild', 'things', 'play', 'Sure', 'fun', 'hearing', 'voice', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'coming', 'out', 'head', 'Wild', 'Thing', 'Carol', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'so', 'little', 'real', 'fun', 'Halfway', 'movie', 'get', 'sinking', 'feeling', 'going', 'be', 'dull', 'flick', 'visual', 'style', 'aptly', 'described', 'Stephanie', 'Zacharek', '[', ']', 'depressive', 'shaggy', 'tired', 'little', 'do', 'film', 'turn', 'TV', 'silently', 'go', 'sleep.Too', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'fascinating', 'trailer', 'was', 'use', 'Arcade', 'Fire', 'song', 'not', 'actually', 'used', 'movie.Many', 'claim', 'not', 'movie', 'kids', 'others', 'insist', 'Results', 'will', 'vary', 'here', 'can', 'least', 'say', 'eight-year-old', 'who', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'kid', 'was', 'excited', 'seeing', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'trailer', 'quickly', 'got', 'bored', 'confused', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie']",Where the Wild Things Are

But swapping out a tin man, a scarecrow, and a lion for a monstrous chicken, goat, and bull loses much of the heart and parallels to reality, allowing our troubled young hero to reflect only upon his own faults - without necessarily learning to resolve his other familial issues. There's plenty of amazing, surreal imagery and a brooding atmosphere, but little magic brightens this fantasy world. At least there's no singing.Young Max (Max Records) feels distanced and alone when he's bullied by his sister's older friends and scolded by his mother. With an outburst of rebellion, Max runs away to a mystical land far away and encounters a group of giant monsters. After convincing them that he possesses significant powers and will be able to shield them from sadness and hostility, they crown him their new king. But as Max's reign of fun gives way to struggles with his new family's jealousy, rage, and fear, the little ruler must come to terms with his own anger and the mistakes he's made throughout his journey.The visual design sense of Where the Wild Things Are is easily its biggest appeal, skillfully combining computer animation and lumbering, monstrous costumes. The expressive faces and furry, ponderous bodies capture the essence of the original illustrations as well as exhibit the creativity of the translation into three dimensions. The various creatures are slimy, beastly, scary and funny all at once.The downfall of the film is the lack of original source material and a deficiency of plot. Very prominent music presides over the entirety of the runtime, along with a depressingly melancholy sadness, but ruling a kingdom, contending with dissension amongst the ranks, building gargantuan fortresses and trekking through the desert only serve as miniscule adventures devoid of substance. The notion of an out-of-control child getting a taste of his own medicine while learning about responsibility is intriguing, especially mixed with the wordless poeticism of Carol serving as Max's inner demon. But while the ideas are creative, the collaboration with feature film doesn't result in much complexity.- The Massie Twins",3,Where the Wild Things Are Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1255651200,"10 16, 2009",2009,2347,"['modernized', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'Maurice', 'Sendak', 'award-winning', 'book', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'cleverly', 'imaginatively', 'idea', 'place', 'home', 'swapping', 'out', 'tin', 'man', 'scarecrow', 'lion', 'monstrous', 'chicken', 'goat', 'bull', 'much', 'heart', 'parallels', 'reality', 'allowing', 'troubled', 'young', 'hero', 'reflect', 'only', 'own', 'faults', 'necessarily', 'learning', 'resolve', 'other', 'familial', 'issues', 'plenty', 'amazing', 'surreal', 'imagery', 'brooding', 'atmosphere', 'little', 'magic', 'brightens', 'fantasy', 'world', 'least', 'singing.Young', 'Max', 'Max', 'Records', 'feels', 'distanced', 'alone', 'when', 'bullied', 'sister', 'older', 'friends', 'scolded', 'mother', 'outburst', 'rebellion', 'Max', 'away', 'mystical', 'land', 'far', 'away', 'group', 'giant', 'monsters', 'convincing', 'significant', 'powers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'shield', 'sadness', 'hostility', 'crown', 'new', 'king', 'Max', 'reign', 'fun', 'way', 'struggles', 'new', 'family', 'jealousy', 'rage', 'fear', 'little', 'ruler', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'own', 'anger', 'mistakes', 'made', 'journey.The', 'visual', 'design', 'sense', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'easily', 'biggest', 'appeal', 'skillfully', 'combining', 'computer', 'animation', 'lumbering', 'monstrous', 'costumes', 'expressive', 'furry', 'ponderous', 'bodies', 'capture', 'essence', 'original', 'illustrations', 'as', 'well', 'exhibit', 'creativity', 'translation', 'three', 'dimensions', 'various', 'creatures', 'are', 'slimy', 'beastly', 'scary', 'funny', 'once.The', 'downfall', 'film', 'lack', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'deficiency', 'plot', 'Very', 'prominent', 'music', 'presides', 'entirety', 'runtime', 'depressingly', 'melancholy', 'sadness', 'ruling', 'kingdom', 'contending', 'dissension', 'ranks', 'building', 'gargantuan', 'fortresses', 'trekking', 'desert', 'only', 'serve', 'miniscule', 'devoid', 'substance', 'notion', 'out-of-control', 'child', 'getting', 'taste', 'own', 'medicine', 'learning', 'responsibility', 'intriguing', 'especially', 'mixed', 'wordless', 'poeticism', 'Carol', 'serving', 'Max', 'inner', 'demon', 'ideas', 'are', 'creative', 'collaboration', 'feature', 'film', ""n't"", 'result', 'much', 'complexity.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",Where the Wild Things Are
1201576,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001HN699A,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 5]","When you decide to create a feature length film based on a children's book that is approximately 10 sentences long, someone, somewhere is going to have to add something. When you are dealing with a revered, classic picture book, you run the risk of alienating many people who might otherwise flock to the theater and fill some seats. It has been many decades since I last read ""Where the Wild Things Are"" written by Maurice Sendak, one of my favorite children's books. But I thoroughly enjoyed the new big screen adaptation from director Spike Jones and screenwriter Dave Eggers.Max (Max Records) is a typical young kid living with his single mom and older sister. One day, he goes outside to play in the snow, builds a snowman and a fort, creating imaginary characters and scenarios to amuse himself. And he is having a great time. He spots his older sister and her friends pull up in front of the house and he has an idea. He quickly gathers as many snowballs as possible. When the older kids come back out of the house, he begins to lob the snowballs at his sister and their friends and a snowball fight begins, Max laughing every minute. When some of the older boys take it a step too far, Max suddenly isn't having fun anymore and becomes upset. Later, wearing his ""Wild Thing"" pajamas, he gets in a fight with his mom and runs off, running as fast as his feet will take him through the neighborhood. He spots a small boat and heads across the lake and sails into the night. The next day, he finds an island and begins to explore. Max quickly finds a group of large monsters playing, roughhousing near a bonfire and joins in. The monsters, who seem to be led by the huge beast Carol (voiced by James Gandolfini) are reluctant to let the new kid into their group, but he is a lot of fun and seems to be a good match, so they let him in. But the group of new friends proves to be just as complicated as a group of humans. Some of them are all too eager to let Max become a part of the group. Others feel pushed to the side while still others are jealous of how quickly Max fits into the group.There has been a lot of press about how worried Warner Bros. was with director Jonze's vision for this film. Personally, I think this is the best thing about the film. Jonze uses a lot of handheld camera work to give us a point of view look at Max and his world. The edits are quick and abrupt, showing us how quickly Max can turn his attention from one thing to the next. The film has a slightly grainy look and is under lit, to give us the illusion we are watching through a hone video camera, like we might be eavesdropping on Max and his adventures. This is, of course, the perfect way to capture the tone of the book because that is what reading ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is like, like you are eavesdropping on someone else's daydreams.Once Max arrives on the island, everything they do and create seem to be larger versions of the very things Max would create to keep himself amused. The Wild Things are basically larger versions of little kids, so this fits. All of this combines to create a great point of view for the film, pushing us into Max's mindset and making us a part of his large world.Max Records is very good as Max, the rambunctious little kid who creates a lot of fantasy to amuse himself. He is instantly loveable and believable as he runs through the gamut of emotions any little kid experiences in a single day. One moment, he couldn't be any happier, than he is crying and upset. When he arrives on the island, he immediately falls into step with the Wild Things. He thinks like them and they seem to like him. All they want to do is play and explore and create little adventures for everyone else. But as the Wild Things get to know Max better, the group begins to experience the same things any group of young kids go through. Some of the creatures get their feelings hurt, some get jealous, some form new friendships. At first, Max seems to really enjoy the company of his new friends, and things couldn't be better, but he begins to realize that things are slowly getting out of hand and suggests they all play a game of War.Each of the actors who provide a voice for one of the Wild Things is great. James Gandolfini stands out as Carol, the leader of the group who whole-heartedly embraces Max's appearance. His thinking and enthusiasms are childlike and exactly perfect for the group. Catherine O'Hara  provides the voice for Judith, the closest match to Carol. As soon as Max appears and begins to distract Carol, she becomes a little jealous, stands a little bit off from the rest of the group. doesn't join in as regularly. Carol notices this and tries to bully her into rejoining the group, but this only serves to make her a little more standoffish. Chris Cooper provides the voice for Douglas, a goat-like Wild Thing who seems to be Carol's second in command. He also seems to be a bit jealous of Max, but follows Carol devotedly wherever he goes. Forest Whitaker and Paul Dano provide the voices for two more Wild Things.Eventually, Max realizes he could be the problem between his new friends, the reason they are all having trouble, getting into fights, so he decides to return home.When Max returns home and walks into the house, his Wild Things pajamas filthy, his worried sick mom (Catherine Keener)... Let's just say the last few moments of the film are just perfect.One thing I can't understand about the film is that it reportedly cost $120 million to make, which is one of the reasons Warner Bros. began to get anxious about the vision of the director. The film is shot to resemble a handheld camera, the Wild Things are large animatronic figures created by the Jim Henson Company and are basically so big an actor wears the suit, most of the film takes place in a single home and on an island with no buildings, only a giant fort built by the characters. What cost $120 million? Max Records salary? There are no car chases, no explosions, no CGI. Don't get me wrong. I'm happy all of those things are missing but this is one case where what was spent on the movie is not reflected on the screen.That said, ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is a joyous adaptation of one of the most beloved children's books of all time. It may just end up becoming a classic and shouldn't be missed. It is also a film that should be seen on the big screen, to capture Max's world adequately.",4,A Kids Book Becomes a Great Movie for All Ages,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,6415,"['When', 'decide',

This film does not deserve that.First off this film is not going to appeal to nearly everyone.  It was not made as a summer blockbluster popcorn eye-candy trifle.  It is closest in spirit to an indie, even art-house drama.  I found myself asking before I saw the movie, ""How do you make a movie out of Sendak's beloved classic?""  This is just one answer.  Directed by Spike Jonze this is a lyrical movie full of pathos and understated emotional reflections.  The main character, Max, is a sad boy in many ways; the movie captures a melancholy, confused state of a pre-adolescent boy as the world grows up around him while he ""stands still"" in the midst of sometimes new and conquering emotions.  Change is not his friend.  After a fit of rage wherein he becomes the not-lovable ""wild thing"" and bites his mother he runs away and ends up in the fantastic imagining of Sendak's Wild Things world.  The Wild Things are aspects of Max's personality and emotions as well as his mother's and sister's personality and emotions (as far as I can see it).  The Wild Thing that he is immediately drawn to (the beastie on the cover) is the personification of his anger, and this is the Wild Thing that he ultimately has to accept even while he breaks away from the Wild Things and leave them behind.  The Wild Things (like real emotions) are wild and often unruly things.  Kudos to Jonze and the other creators in making a thoughtful tale about emotions out of this beloved fairy tale (itself about emotions--go on, look at that book again).Hopefully, many people will give this movie a second chance.  This movie can be for the (older) kids, though it is made just as much if not more for the adults.",5,Lyrical.,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,1894,"['As', 'late', 'am', 'coming', 'review', 'seeing', 'wide', 'range', 'reviews', 'am', 'not', 'surprised', 'mix', 'reviews', 'am', 'how', 'many', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'proportion', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'not', 'deserve', 'that.First', 'film', 'not', 'going', 'appeal', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'summer', 'blockbluster', 'popcorn', 'eye-candy', 'trifle', 'closest', 'spirit', 'indie', 'even', 'art-house', 'drama', 'found', 'asking', 'saw', 'movie', 'How', 'do', 'make', 'movie', 'Sendak', 'beloved', 'classic', 'just', 'one', 'answer', 'Directed', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'lyrical', 'movie', 'full', 'pathos', 'understated', 'emotional', 'reflections', 'main', 'character', 'Max', 'sad', 'boy', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'melancholy', 'confused', 'state', 'pre-adolescent', 'boy', 'world', 'up', 'still', 'midst', 'sometimes', 'new', 'conquering', 'emotions', 'Change', 'not', 'friend', 'fit', 'rage', 'wherein', 'not-lovable', 'wild', 'thing', 'mother', 'away', 'up', 'fantastic', 'imagining', 'Sendak', 'Wild', 'Things', 'world', 'Wild', 'Things', 'are', 'aspects', 'Max', 'personality', 'emotions', 'as', 'well', 'mother', 'sister', 'personality', 'emotions', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'Wild', 'Thing', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'beastie', 'cover', 'personification', 'anger', 'Wild', 'Thing', 'ultimately', 'accept', 'even', 'away', 'Wild', 'Things', 'leave', 'Wild', 'Things', 'real', 'emotions', 'are', 'wild', 'often', 'unruly', 'things', 'Kudos', 'Jonze', 'other', 'creators', 'making', 'thoughtful', 'tale', 'emotions', 'beloved', 'fairy', 'tale', 'emotions', 'go', 'look', 'book', 'again', '.Hopefully', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'give', 'movie', 'second', 'chance', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'older', 'kids', 'made', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'adults']",Where the Wild Things Are
1201578,A3SRBACI3VJD9R,B001HN699A,T. Johnson,"[4, 5]","I enjoyed this movie, it was unique and I think succeeded in being what it wanted to be, but I was definitely struck by the dark tone of virtually all of it. There was a lot more angst and a lot less fun than I expected. It had a dark, adult feel to it. I loved the creatures, the voice actors were great, Max Records was perfect and not annoying (which is unusual for a child actor). The fort was a spectacle, the story was interesting, it meshes well as an outgrowth of the book. It was also not really what I expected it to be, for better or worse.Is it for children? Well, those who deny that it unusually dark, intense, and ""realistic"" (a funny word to use but still) for a children's movie are kidding themselves. But the question of whether that's OK for kids is another matter. I watched it with my 6 year old and he was fine with it, but he also didn't enjoy it as much as he does with more standard kids fare like Hotel For Dogs for instance. Generally I think it would be good for parents to just be aware that this movie is darker and more intense than typical kid movies, and you would probably want to watch this movie with them.

The trailers looked great.  But...The movie was VERY disappointing.  The movie is about a very depressed and emotionally unstable child.  Who leaves reality in pretending.  He lashes out at his mother and sister and sister's friends for that matter and runs away.  Gets on a boat and sets sail to another land.  Now, I'm pretty sure that land doesn't exist, but that it is his dreamland.  He meets these odd creatures that remind me of H.R. Puff N Stuff.The whole movie has really no plot.  More like a long Jerry Seinfeld episode.  However, the Jerry Seinfeld episodes were so much better and well crafted.  This movie lacked a plot and just didn't keep my interest.  I watched it with my 10 year old and just explained to him that the child on this movie had problems and that kids should behave like that.The creatures themselves were cool looking and were CGI, but they did have this whole ""man in a costume"" kinda look to them.  Now whether they did have people inside, really wasn't apparent, nor did it matter.I don't recommend this depressing movie at all.  It really has no value to it and there is no lesson to be learned other than, ""There are kids out there that are like that, and they escape reality through dreams and make believe.""There were little stories here and there, but they either didn't make sense, or didn't resolve.I recommend you steer in another direction and leave this one behind.

1201581,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001HN699A,Tsuyoshi,"[9, 14]","The best part of the live-action version of Maurice Sendak's ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is the fantastic monsters created by the Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The wild creatures are not too fearsome (they can be if they want to), and they are not too cute. They may not be always likable, but they are real, in the magic realism way, and the voice actors (including Lauren Ambrose, Chris Cooper, Paul Dano, James Gandolfini, Catherine O'Hara, and Forest Whitaker) did a great job, giving life to each character they play.The story of Max (Max Records) a very imaginative boy in the wolf costume needs no new introduction. Catherine Keener plays his mother, and though her screen time is not much - as this film is about Max and the ""Wild Things"" on the island Max visits in his imagination - she did a solid job of providing a back story to the disobedient boy Max, who runs way from home and travels to the imaginary world.The story gets slower once Max arrives at the strange island where he joins a group of ferocious-looking monsters. In fact, if you are looking for big adventures, you will be disappointed. Max is made the king of the monsters and dance with them, but the Spike Jonze-directed film focuses the original story's psychoanalytic aspect. Obviously each monster represent something deeply related to Max's life (or the way he looks at it) and his personality, especially anger. Intriguing, but maybe not something for kids.So, in spite of the impressions you might get from the film's beautiful poster, its content is rather sad and even depressing to some. This is how Spike Jonze interpreted the beloved classic and we should remember he has directed such films as ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"" - definitely unique and thought-provoking, but not quite everyone's cup of tea, just like his latest work.",3,"""Where the Wild Things Are"" from the Director of ""Being John Malkovich"": Unique, Dark, Not Quite Everyone's Cup of Tea",1265328000,"02 5, 2010",2010,1830,"['best', 'part', 'live-action', 'version', 'Maurice', 'Sendak', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'fantastic', 'monsters', 'created', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Creature', 'Shop', 'wild', 'creatures', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'fearsome', 'can', 'be', 'want', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'cute', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'always', 'likable', 'are', 'real', 'magic', 'realism', 'way', 'voice', 'actors', 'including', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'giving', 'life', 'character', 'play.The', 'story', 'Max', 'Max', 'Records', 'very', 'imaginative', 'boy', 'wolf', 'costume', 'new', 'introduction', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'mother', 'screen', 'time', 'not', 'much', 'film', 'Max', 'Wild', 'Things', 'island', 'Max', 'visits', 'imagination', 'did', 'solid', 'job', 'providing', 'back', 'story', 'disobedient', 'boy', 'Max', 'who', 'way', 'home', 'travels', 'imaginary', 'world.The', 'story', 'slower', 'once', 'Max', 'strange', 'island', 'where', 'group', 'ferocious-looking', 'monsters', 'fact', 'are', 'looking', 'big', 'adventures', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Max', 'made', 'king', 'monsters', 'dance', 'Spike', 'Jonze-directed', 'film', 'original', 'story', 'psychoanalytic', 'aspect', 'Obviously', 'monster', 'represent', 'something', 'deeply', 'related', 'Max', 'life', 'way', 'personality', 'especially', 'anger', 'Intriguing', 'maybe', 'not', 'something', 'kids.So', 'spite', 'impressions', 'might', 'get', 'film', 'beautiful', 'poster', 'content', 'rather', 'sad', 'even', 'depressing', 'how', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'interpreted', 'beloved', 'classic', 'should', 'remember', 'directed', 'such', 'films', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Adaptation', 'definitely', 'unique', 'thought-provoking', 'not', 'quite', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'just', 'latest', 'work']",Where the Wild Things Are

When the real world got you down you always knew that your world was waiting for you. Then as you got older things were changing all around you in ways you couldn't understand and at the same time your world was no longer a place you wanted to escape to. That is what the whimsical world of Max is all about in `Where The Wild Things Are.'Based on one of the most beloved children's book, we are brought into the world of Max. He is a boy with a fierce imagination and is always looking for others to join him in his adventures. Apparently there was a time when plenty of people were part of his world. Now things are not as fun as they use to be. He is having a hard time being ignored by his teenaged sister and doesn't seem to understand why his mom is so wrapped up in work and dating other men since the passing of his dad. One night he realizes he just can't take it anymore and runs away. He finds is a lonely row boat that takes him to a far off place. There he finds a whole bunch of large creatures that just want to play and have just as much fun as Max. They welcome Max into their world and make him their king. As King Max tried to bring the two worlds together, but something happens especially with one of the creatures named Carol (Played by James Gandolfini) After that Max suddenly realizes that sometimes even when you trying to escape from your troubles they will always find away to catch up and the only way to make them go away is to face them.Where The Wild Things are is not a fantastic movie, nor is it horrible. It is a very original style of film making that you don't see too often, so it takes a little bit of getting use to. This movie was a real risk on director Spike Jonze. To take a book that has no more than 9 lines of dialogue and create a whole world out of it is nothing short of brilliant. This movie unfortunately can send many mixed signals, especially to parents of young children. Despite the PG rating this is not a film for kids. This movie is mature in nature, it's about a child trying to cope with growing up. It may have its elements of fantasy and big fuzzy creatures, but these big fuzzy creatures are as real as real can be. They suffer because of the anarchy they live in and just want to be set strait and given direction and Max wants to get away from all of that. He realizes that being a king takes a lot of hard work and responsibility and he discovers that some times only thinking about you can lead to torn friendships and hurting hearts. It's a movie that really tugs at all of your emotions. It's a movie especially for us who love the story will appreciate.

Somehow, the Wild Things of Sendak's classic favorite truly come to life on screen, just as they appeared in the charming children's book. A lot had to be added to fill the brief book out to the length of a feature movie, but certainly nothing was taken away.Jonze also did a remarkably accurate job in rendering the imaginative small boy, Max, around whom the movie revolves. Like so many, he crosses freely over the line between fantasy and reality - maybe more freely than some, and maybe more freely than is really good for him. Jonze's accuracy carries a chill behind its warmth, though. Max gets carried away a bit too often, and has to deal with the complexities of growing up. Like so many, he really doesn't have the tools to deal with them, and strategies from his younger years no longer do what he needs done. It's easy to idealize a young boy's life in terms of imagination and adventure, but Jonze reminds us that boys have plenty of problems trying to make a place in a world full of people bigger and more experienced than they are.It's a beautiful movie and a brilliant rendering of Sendak's work.

1201590,A1QIL7847ET6HX,B001HN699A,xxgrendelxx,"[451, 518]","It's a funny thing: adults have no problem loading films with whizzing bullets, raging flames and bellowing anger and slap a PG rating on it, but the moment the protagonist is a child they back off and claim ""Whoa - this is too intense and scary!"".Nuts.The claims that this film is a little intense are true - it IS intense because it's much more honest and real than any other films for children available in the last thirty years. By 'for children' I mean ALL children, any age.Those who can't recall what it was like to be a kid aren't going to get it. They will be those who don't recall what it was like to be frightened, who don't recall how it feels to be second best to those they love most, who never had to carve out a slice of reality (or unreality) for themselves to make sense of the incomprehensible.The world portrayed in the film is the real world where individuals live their own lives, sometimes at the expense of the feelings of those immediately around them, especially family. This may be the source of the films undeserved reputation as ""scary"" - while it is certainly no ghetto, ""Max"" the child protoganist lives in a realistically portrayed lower income neighborhood and his familial troubles are ones all too many children are accustomed to. He responds to these cares in ways that are well documented in child psychology. If this setting is considered by some as too scary for children then we have only ourselves to blame. This is how the real world is - it is not an Eighties family sit-com.My nephew (5) and neice (9) are currently going through their parents divorce. Without spelling out the obvious overmuch, it was with a little trepidation that my Brother and I took them to see this yesterday. They're pretty resilient kids and they internalise more than they let on, acting out infrequently but we still weren't sure. They handled it fine and they ""got it"".It seems to me modern American parents have bee brainwashed into believing that only a saccahrine sunny diet is suitable for youngsters - is this perhaps signs of guilt for the dangerous mess we've made of the world, that we must protect them at all turns, from life and living itself?I've got news for you: the world has always been a scary place to kids, whether it was Indian attacks, Great Depressions, A-bombs or terrorists the world continues to turn and there's always a new bogey-man to shield our kids from. But to never let a hint of reality through is unhealthy.For a hundred generations children have been told fairytales about death and loss and danger (sex and responsibility, too). Only relatively recently has the PC craze in American culture turned on this traditional method of exposing kids to reality. How many people in my generation (I'm 41) saw Gene Wilder in ""The Little Prince"" in the Seventies?The film's lesson as it is given implies that immense things may crash around you, some of which may have been set in motion by yourself and you must cope as well as you can. Not everything is perfect and never will be; to expect such perfection is immature and unreasonable. And yet sincere contrition, empathy and love will help your world turn, turn it away from the dark scary things. Perhaps this also is a source of the negative impression of this film: the film accepts that the world is a dangerous, sometimes callous and frightening place. This is not a significant truism in the realm of modern juvenile entertainment where nine year olds easily defeat ninjas and aliens and are always smarter than those silly adults, yet it is difficult to deny. It's utilization by Spike Jonze is counter-revolutionary for the better.A previous reviewer missed the point when they said that ""Max"" abandons his friends, the monsters, at the films end and what kind of lesson is that?The monsters are not his friends - they are part of him, they are the facets of his own personality allowed to run amok.When Max leaves the monster island at the end it is because he's a little wiser and more in control. He doesn't feel the need to act out and run wild.He has seen firsthand that acts that are inherently violent, regardless of playful intent, have real and negative consequences, but he needed to see them in this fairytale place to understand his own responsibilty.Only then is he ready to come home and be civil with the people who love him.And yet, he loves the monsters and howls for them because they all are a part of him or of the systems that dictate the form of his life. They are his Id run wild and free as he would like to be, yet not wild with malice (destructive as they are) and thus worthy of mourning. They help save him from those self-destructive aspects in himself like the monster ""Carol"" because he isn't meant to live ""Where the Wild Things Are"". He grows more than most adults will in a lifetime by coming to terms with these violent emotional 'monsters'. He has seen them and he has seen them in himself. He will never be free of them but he knows what is important - his love for his family.The dialogue in the film is fascinating and a key to the whole. It is kid talk. A mystery to adults, it has it's own logic and rules like ""Faerie"" or ""Wonderland"". One must navigate carefully to avoid catastrophe as Max discovers. I think my neice understood it better than I did, even if the metaphor escaped her. And so it is within ourselves if we might regard our own inner workings as ""monsters"" - the wrong inflection or phrasing, even when addressing ourselves, sets off whole chains of sometimes violent emotion.In the end, my neice and nephew left the theatre understanding that with someone to love you and someone to love everything is alright - you may go away to confront your own demons and fears for a time but the ones you care for and that care for you will be there waiting, no matter what age you are.And that makes the world and this film alright.PS - A brief mention of the soundtrack is in order: it too is outstanding. It has what I can only describe as a 1970s 'feel' too it - it is a little wild, unpolished, honest, hairy, chirpy and sweet all at once.The first thing I thought of on listening as the film progressed were the children's album by Marlo Thomas ""Free To Be You and Me"" and the end/closing titles song as a childrens version of Lennon's ""Give Peace a Chance"" with all it's enthusiastic happy hoots and howls. It had me as choked up as I haven't been in a long time over a movie.Thanks, Maurice, Karen, Spike et al.",5,Outstanding - ignore some critics claims this isn't for kids,1262563200,"01 4,
