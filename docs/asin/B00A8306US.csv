The main character is a young college student who was raised by his older sister after their parents die.  Now she is married to a slightly older man, with two daughters from previous marriages (Sora and Miu) and a loveable three year old daughter (Hina).  But when he watches them while they go on their honeymoon, the plane crashes, leaving them alone until he decides to take them in.  Now a small room, three girls (two on which are at THAT age), and a beautiful love interest, can Yutta bring about the happy family, or will he have to let this dream go.As I said, this was a well written, heartfilled story.  Each character has personalitly, especially Hina, the little weapon of mass destruction of cuteness (everywhere she goes, people love her and give her little treats).  Whille the story is done, it does have a small opening that could bring a second season.  One who likes a story, rather than fan service or over filled with violence.

1606754,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00A8306US,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[25, 29]","Color me shocked. When I saw the first screenshots of ""Listen to Me Girls, I Am Your Father!"", my mind instantly painted the ugliest picture of it. For a jaded anime viewer, some shots of three underage girls being taken care of by a college-age man looks like yet another sketchy sex comedy. Out of curiosity at how abhorrent and trashy it would be, I watched the first episode. And then the funniest thing happened.It caught me off guard, kicked me in the gut, and dragged me through all of its 13 episodes with force. And I loved every second of it. ""Listen to Me, Girls!"" is one of the best anime comedy-dramas in recent memories, and any fan worth their salt owes it to themselves to watch it.Yuuta is a single college student, barely scraping by in his studio apartment. His luck with the ladies is suspect, and he only has one or two good friends to speak of. His life is about to get a lot harder, though; his sister wants him to look after her three rambunctious daughters for a few days, while she's overseas with her husband. He agrees, knowing he's got his work cut out for him, but also knowing it's only temporary.Spoiler alert: it's not. In the second episode, the girls' mother and father die in a plane crash. The relatives want them to be separated and to live in different households, but Yuuta knows that would devastate them. So instead, he devastates himself by taking them all into his flat. Thus begins a roller coaster of double-shifts, angry landlords, and (you guessed it) typical ribald anime hijinks.But the thing is? The latter part is mostly comprised of suggestive humor, nothing more. Furthermore, it only seems to be tacked on to ensnare the creeps, because the core concept of the show, as well as the execution, is incredibly tasteful. Not only that, but it treads into territory most ""harem"" anime (if you could even call this that) doesn't: realism.The most admirable thing about this show, in my opinion, is its harsh, cynical take on the classic(?) ""let's have a bumbling guy drowning in estrogen"" concept. Yuuta constantly needs to find work, barely scraping together enough money from part-time jobs to pay his rent and put food on the table. His apartment is cramped, the girls are always causing trouble, and the landlord threatens to kick them out. This is not a candy-coated jailbait fantasy; this is, more or less, what would happen if a college dude started taking care of three kids: chaos.Speaking of the girls, they're some of the most believable in anime. Most impressive is Hina, a precocious three year-old who stumbles and trips through life with little regard for anything but her own curiosity and her sisters. As somebody who has worked taking care of preschoolers before, I can attest to the fact that the writers obviously have a small child of their own, because the things that Hina says and does are startlingly accurate to how a real child behaves. Now if only they could have carried that realism over to her hair...The other two sisters are slightly less well-written, but strong characters nonetheless. Ten year-old Miu is ditsy and obsessed with having a boyfriend, which naturally leads her into some messy situations later on. She displays some convincing traits, but ultimately, the writers tried too hard to fit her into a character archetype as opposed to letting her expand naturally as a character. My favorite of the three, though, has to be Sora, the eldest at 14 years old and packing a serious attitude. She is fiercely protective of her younger sisters, and not afraid to smack-talk Yuuta when she feels he's being lazy or getting out of line. Oftentimes, though, she does this to quell her own inadequacies. But there's a reason she's hard on him, and it's one that may make or break your interest in the show.See, Sora has a crush on Yuta. No, this isn't a childish ""I think he's kinda cute but I'm related to him"" kind of deal. This is a full-blown thing, to the point where she routinely dreams about him being in love with her and vows to not give up on him, even at the end of the series. This has some disturbing implications, to say the least, especially when the writers seem to expect viewers to encourage this pursuit. While incest comedies are nothing new to anime, it feels really out of place in this particular series, which is what keeps me from awarding it a perfect grade. At least it's counteracted by Yuta's primary love interest, the downright bizarre ravenhead Raika, who thankfully is of legal age and isn't related to him.For those who sound weary of the concept, though, I urge you to try and give the show a shot. It's rare that an anime handles losing a parent, taking care of children, or going through college in a realistic fashion, let alone doing it all in the same series. The music is excellent and suitably catchy, and the animation is quite beautiful for such a simplistic series (except for the bizarre elbow glow that you'll notice on the girls... I don't even understand why that's there).Despite the anticlimactic ending, and despite the aforementioned uncomfortable content, ""Listen to Me Girls, I Am Your Father!"" is a winner. Most new anime coming to North American shores in the past few months hasn't been worth spending 40 to 60 dollars of your hard-earned money, but speaking as a broke college student, I would gladly shell out the money for this show. Cute, realistic, and heartfelt, this is one of the better ""harem"" anime in recent memory, and nowhere nearly as creepy as it looks.Grade: B+",4,"Against All Odds, This Heartwarming Series

And he is 18 or 19 to her 14, which makes just 4 or 5 years' difference. There were nine years between my parents. 14 is too young for marriage or anything serious, but there isn't anything serious at this point anyway. When she's 18 and he's 22-23, if they love each other, there's no issue. Incest is not involved.Given that incest is the only reason Blondeau rated the anime at 4 stars instead of 5...I rate it 5.Oh, by the way, the series made it clear that all 3 girls had different mothers. I believe at least one of the first two died. So all three girls have had their share of tragedies, and they are all doubly orphaned.
