You want bizarre, you want unpredictable, you want oh-my-god-what-the-hell-is-going-on...take a look at UFC 3.All the elements were in place for a titanic Royce Gracie/Ken Shamrock rematch in the final.  Opposite brackets, each with beatable, untested opponents.  Both principles rested and in good health.  Either they'd face each other, or one would get toppled in an incredible upset, and we've have a brand new rivalry on our hands.  It had to happen.  Right?It starts out reasonably enough.  Keith Hackney, a scrappy little bulldog from the mean streets of Chicago, takes on the gargantuan but immobile and clumsy Emmanuel Yarborough, with predictable results.  Next, Shamrock grapples with veteran judo fighter Cristophe Leninger, who gives a valiant match.  Then Canadian trash-talking pummeller Harold Howard trades punches with hometown hero Roland Payne, an action-packed slugfest with a suitably spectacular conclusion.And then things get weird.No one could've predicted this.  But then, isn't that the beauty of sports?  Who would've thought that the script would go off the rails so suddenly.  And that Steve Jennum would have to step up to save the day.  (Steve who?

I am very excited about the release of this event on DVD because it was the first UFC event that I ever watched. Out of all of the classic UFC shows early on, this one is my favorite. The stage was set with 650+ pound Manny Yarborough (Sumo) taking on 200 pound Keith Hackney (Karate). Needless to say I was INSTANTLY hooked to this sport.The entire card was interesting (with the exception of the main event). Royce Gracie had what was easily his most exciting fight in the octagon when he took on a rather spooky looking Kimo. Man, this is a wonderful bit of history to own.

973511,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000EHSVIM,Jason,"[1, 1]","Ahh, UFC #3, the event that I will forever remember as ""The Fat Guy Beatdown.""The glory days, the olden days, the pre-rule gladiatorial times when matches were made based upon the man and the heart, but not the skill and the weight class.  There was something romantic about it all back then, despite the burgeoning sport's relative lack of highly skilled talent.Going into this competition, it was pretty clear that Ken Shamrock and Royce Gracie were the men to beat.  The most memorable fight, however, was Keith Hackney versus 600lb. Emmanuel Yarborough.  The disparity in size was ridiculous, and it was the great unknown in matchups like this that made the original UFC events so appealing.  In very short time viewers realized the old axiom, ""The bigger they are the harder they fall"" is quite true, as Hackney landed a shot that dropped Yarborough on his rotund behind.  After recovering, the quarter-ton fighter shoved Hackney through the octagon fence, something I'd never seen before.  Eventually, however, the man whose body resembled a giant M&M; found out that one has to have SOME fighting skill to beat the early days toughmen of the UFC.The only headliner fight was Royce Gracie taking on tattooed challenger Kimo Leopoldo.  Eventually succumbing to Gracie's superior BJJ, it was Leopoldo that fatigued Gracie enough that he later withdrew, and showed the world that there was, indeed, a chink in the Brazilian's armor.Ultimately this was a very disappointing UFC because the top two fighters withdrew due to injury/fatigue, and the third best fighter (Leopoldo) got gypped by bracketing.  When a nobody like Steve Jennum can get gifted a late replacement into the FINALS, you know there is a problem.  When his opponent (Harold Howard) looks like an extra in a B-rated biker movie and attempts the most ridiculous move in fighting history - just picture someone doing a front flip and landing on their back without making contact with anything or anyone else - then you know the problems are huge.  This was still during the infancy of the UFC and they soon learned that balance was necessary in order for scheduling to combat fighter fatigue.",4,"The bigger they are, the harder they fall",1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,2160,"['Ahh', 'UFC', '3', 'event', 'will', 'forever', 'remember', 'Fat', 'Guy', 'Beatdown', 'glory', 'days', 'olden', 'days', 'pre-rule', 'gladiatorial', 'times', 'when', 'matches', 'were', 'made', 'based', 'man', 'heart', 'not', 'skill', 'weight', 'class', 'was', 'something', 'romantic', 'back', 'then', 'burgeoning', 'sport', 'relative', 'lack', 'highly', 'skilled', 'talent.Going', 'competition', 'was', 'pretty', 'clear', 'Ken', 'Shamrock', 'Royce', 'Gracie', 'were', 'men', 'beat', 'most', 'memorable', 'fight', 'however', 'was', 'Keith', 'Hackney', 'versus', '600lb', 'Emmanuel', 'Yarborough', 'disparity', 'size', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'great', 'unknown', 'matchups', 'made', 'original', 'UFC', 'events', 'so', 'appealing', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'viewers', 'realized', 'old', 'axiom', 'bigger', 'are', 'harder', 'fall', 'quite', 'true', 'Hackney', 'landed', 'shot', 'dropped', 'Yarborough', 'rotund', 'recovering', 'quarter-ton', 'fighter', 'shoved', 'Hackney', 'octagon', 'fence', 'something', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Eventually', 'however', 'man', 'body', 'resembled', 'giant', 'M', 'M', 'found', 'one', 'have', 'SOME', 'fighting', 'skill', 'beat', 'early', 'days', 'toughmen', 'UFC.The', 'only', 'headliner', 'fight', 'was', 'Royce', 'Gracie', 'taking', 'tattooed', 'challenger', 'Kimo', 'Leopoldo', 'Eventually', 'succumbing', 'Gracie', 'superior', 'BJJ', 'was', 'Leopoldo', 'fatigued', 'Gracie', 'enough', 'later', 'withdrew', 'showed', 'world', 'was', 'indeed', 'chink', 'Brazilian', 'armor.Ultimately', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'UFC', 'top', 'two', 'fighters', 'withdrew', 'due', 'injury/fatigue', 'third', 'best', 'fighter', 'Leopoldo', 'got', 'gypped', 'bracketing', 'When', 'nobody', 'Steve', 'Jennum', 'can', 'get', 'gifted', 'late', 'replacement', 'FINALS', 'know', 'problem', 'When', 'opponent', 'Harold', 'Howard', 'extra', 'B-rated', 'biker', 'movie', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'move', 'fighting', 'history', 'just', 'picture', 'someone', 'doing', 'front', 'flip', 'landing', 'back', 'making', 'contact', 'anything', 'anyone', 'else', 'then', 'know', 'problems', 'are', 'huge', 'was', 'still', 'infancy', 'UFC', 'soon', 'learned', 'balance', 'was', 'necessary', 'order', 'scheduling', 'combat', 'fighter', 'fatigue']",Ufc #3: The American Dream

Everyone anticipated a return bout of Gracie vs Shamrock in the Final, but alas injuries would not allow this to happen.  UFC 3 also returns to the original format of 8 fighters in the 1st round, with the winners progressing onward.  Once again, there is an interesting mix of fighters squared off against each other with their respective martial arts disciplines on display.1st Round Matchups:1. 6'8"" 616 pd Emmanuel Yarbrough (Sumo) vs Keith Hackney (Kempo Kung Fu)2. Ken Shamrock (Shootfighting) vs Christophe Leininger (Judo)3. Roland Payne (Muy Thai) vs Harold Howard (Karate)4. Royce Gracie (Jiu-Jitsu) vs Kimo Leopoldo (Tae Kwon Do)The 1st round fights lasted a bit longer than some of the fights in the first 2 UFC's.  The best fight for me was Gracie vs Kimo.  Kimo was very tough, and Gracie's most difficult opponent to date.  Also, once again we have a huge Sumo fighter taking on a karate expert, and the outcome is to be expected.  As mentioned in other reviews, the Final is disappointing, as several fighters were injured in their fights, and unable to continue.Overall, this DVD does not have as great of fights as the 1st 2 UFC's, but it still provides plenty of knockouts and submissions for the UFC fan!",4,"UFC 3 : ""The American Dream""",1220400000,"09 3, 2008",2008,1363,"['UFC', '3', 'Charlotte', 'North', 'Carolina', 'return', 'Royce', 'Gracie', 'Ken', 'Shamrock', 'debut', 'Kimo', 'Leopoldo', 'Everyone', 'anticipated', 'return', 'bout', 'Gracie', 'vs', 'Shamrock', 'Final', 'alas', 'injuries', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'happen', 'UFC', '3', 'also', 'original', 'format', '8', 'fighters', '1st', 'round', 'winners', 'progressing', 'onward', 'Once', 'again', 'interesting', 'mix', 'fighters', 'squared', 'off', 'other', 'respective', 'martial', 'arts', 'disciplines', 'display.1st', 'Round', 'Matchups:1', '6', '8', '616', 'pd', 'Emmanuel', 'Yarbrough', 'Sumo', 'vs', 'Keith', 'Hackney', 'Kempo', 'Kung', 'Fu', '2', 'Ken', 'Shamrock', 'Shootfighting', 'vs', 'Christophe', 'Leininger', 'Judo', '3', 'Roland', 'Payne', 'Muy', 'Thai', 'vs', 'Harold', 'Howard', 'Karate', '4', 'Royce', 'Gracie', 'Jiu-Jitsu', 'vs', 'Kimo', 'Leopoldo', 'Tae', 'Kwon', 'Do', '1st', 'round', 'fights', 'lasted', 'bit', 'longer', 'fights', 'first', '2', 'UFC', 'best', 'fight', 'was', 'Gracie', 'vs', 'Kimo', 'Kimo', 'was', 'very', 'tough', 'Gracie', 'most', 'difficult', 'opponent', 'date', 'Also', 'once', 'again', 'have', 'huge', 'Sumo', 'fighter', 'taking', 'karate', 'expert', 'outcome', 'be', 'expected', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', 'Final', 'disappointing', 'several', 'fighters', 'were', 'injured', 'fights', 'unable', 'continue.Overall', 'DVD', 'not', 'have', 'great', 'fights', '1st', '2', 'UFC', 'still', 'plenty', 'knockouts', 'submissions', 'UFC', 'fan']",Ufc #3: The American Dream

UFC 3 - ""The American Dream"" was decent, but the main event was quite uninteresting, as an alternate had to step in for the final fight.

He is indeed a strange and eccentric character - and he gives Gracie his best fight in UFC competition to that point.Aside from this standout matchup, there is some decent action and some rather humorous characters.

973515,A3GM64N13BILUP,B000EHSVIM,Ron Cole,"[2, 3]","Modern Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) is a hybrid sport where fighters train in both striking (usually a combination of techniques from boxing, Muay Thai, and Taekwondo) and grappling (Brazilian Jiujitsu and wrestling). A thick rulebook exists that prohibits such attacks as biting, hair pulling, eye gouging, hitting to the groan, kneeing/elbowing a ""downed"" opponent, etc... Even clothing is regulated, with padded gloves and mouthpieces required to minimize damage.That, however, is not how it used to be. In the ""old days"" of ultimate fighting, martial artists from completely different spheres of combat would come together in no-holds barred battles of complete domination. There were no weight limits, You might see a huge sumo wrestler battle a karate master or a boxer trying to punch out a ninja. You couldn't be disqualified for biting (though you could be fined), hair-pulling was legal, and punching to the groin happened all the time. During this ""iron age"" of MMA, fighters battled to answer the age-old question of which martial arts style was the most powerful - and ""hybrid"" martial artists were almost non-existant.UFC 3 is the epitomy of this age, and one of the best MMA tournaments you will ever watch. MMA legends like Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock are at the top of their games during this event, and matches that would NEVER happen in modern times (such as the legendary sumo vs. kenpo karate fight where the cage is broken during a sumo-slam) are common-place. While the very last match is a bit of a let-down, almost every single one before it is high-intensity combat that will make your jaw drop.
