He has a way of taking everyday situations and words and taking them apart in a straight-forward manner that leaves all who hear it laughing on the floor uncontrolably. While I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is &quot;easily offended&quot;, the rest of us with a sense of humor can thank Joe Pesci (some of you will know what I mean!) that he has given us George Carlin.",5,The Master Of Comedy In Two Of His Greatest Performances!,998697600,"08 25, 2001",2001,454,"['What', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'George', 'Carlin', 'man', 'comic', 'genius', 'way', 'taking', 'everyday', 'situations', 'words', 'taking', 'apart', 'straight-forward', 'manner', 'who', 'hear', 'laughing', 'floor', 'uncontrolably', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'quot', 'easily', 'offended', 'quot', 'rest', 'sense', 'humor', 'can', 'thank', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'given', 'George', 'Carlin']",George Carlin - Doin' It Again/Jammin' In New York

A few days ago I read Carlin's reaction to the current onslaught of decency and decided to check him out.  I thought he was great.  One problem.  From the date given for the show (Jammin') and everything I could read about it, I was/am sure Carlin was talking about poppa Bush.  Yet I KNOW he named Dick Cheyney and Colin Powell.  Huh?  Regardless (though it bugs me), he was dead-on when he said if the government says it, don't believe it.  Not even the FDA.  And the reviewers who say politics and humor don't mix (Mark Twain and Oscar Wilde sure didn't say it!) just got cut a little close to the nerve.  I wish (did he?) he'd do something current (as Tom Lehrer said, that's like asking a citizen of Pompeii to say something amusing about lava).  Like about all the little uglies with their little axes running about like Carrie Nation screaming things like ""the sanctity of marriage"" (they don't mean sanctimonious, by any chance) and ""tradition"" and generally trying to run the lives of everyone they can.  I'd love to see what he'd do with that!  George Carlin was nothing like what I'd expected, instead he was more so, and I thought his numbers on similarities, euphemisms and the first bit on words (pomposity of expressions) were a riot.  But I squirmed when he said ""fruit.""  Ain't nothin' sacred!  Yet when I asked a friend of mine how he'd feel if Howard Stern talked that way about his own girlfriend, he said he'd feel ""proud.""

George Carlin is one of those comics. His altered perspective on life leads the listener on a  rollercoaster ride of laughing not only at his criticism and snips at  modern life but also at the audience themselves.  Carlin is one of the  comedy higherarchy that other comedians look up to and respect, it is shown  why in his performances. Such are two of his best, &quot;Doin it  Again&quot; and &quot;Jammin in New York&quot; illustrate just how some  things can get better with age as Carlin in his late 50's presents himself  at his peak.
