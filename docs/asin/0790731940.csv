The cast is fine, although Mel Gibson is a little more intense as Bret Maverick than James Garner was. Garner had a laid-back quality that suited the role well. Putting Garner in this movie was a nice touch, by the way, and he and Jodie Foster are delightful. Gibson is fine, too, just .. different. Of course, the slightly different feel doesn't matter much unless you remember the show, which isn't the case for many contemporary viewers. More to the point, perhaps, the TV Maverick was a western spoof. It was done tongue-in-cheek and relied on humor. The movie attempts the same feel, but the gags are rather ordinary and the plot, while it has some interesting twists in it, is slow to develop. Taken as a whole, &quot;Maverick&quot; comes across as a fun movie, but there isn't much in it to lift above the ordinary. It's too bad they haven't tried making another, though. After all, the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie wasn't great, either. I rate &quot;Maverick&quot; 3+ stars.

98319,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,0790731940,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[3, 4]","A 1990's Western comedy featuring Mel Gibson, Maverick was a breath of fresh air when first appeared in theaters. The film doesn't take itself so seriously as many films with a Western setting tend to do. Based on the 1950's television series by the same name in which James Garner had a starring role, Maverick is a uniquely clever and entertaining adventure comedy...When Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson) needs $25,000 to enter a winner-take-all poker tournament, he travels through towns en route to the tournament in the hopes of winning every dollar he needs. But he quickly encounters Angel (Alfred Molina), a roughneck poker player in his own right who tries to kill Maverick (his attempt inevitably fails).Along the way, Maverick meets up with Ms. Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) - a slick, conniving poker player who picks Maverick's pocket following a brief romantic encounter. When Maverick catches her, he forces her to wash his shirt as punishment. Shrinking his designer shirt, Annabelle runs off to catch a riverboat with Maverick running after her. After boarding the boat, the two are joined by Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) - a kind, retired sheriff famous throughout the West. Cooper's chivalry and hospitality greatly contrast with Maverick's brisk demeanor when it comes to dealing with Ms. Bransford.As the three travel cross country, they face a series of pitfalls such as a dead coach driver who almost runs their coach off the top of a cliff, a showdown with hundreds of Indians, and Maverick's financial dealings with an Archduke from Russia. Separated in the confusion, the three eventually meet again on the Riverboat Lauren Belle, home of the championship poker game hosted by the riverboat's owner Commodore Duvall. Making use of his quick wit, Maverick raises the extra cash he needs to join the poker game (as well as a few thousand extra for Annabelle Bransford). Commodore Duvall puts Marshal Zane Cooper in charge of guarding the $500,000 in entry fees for the tournament in which Angel also happens to be a participant.  But in addition to beating Angel, Maverick faces other obstacles of even greater challenge...Overall, Maverick is great entertainment. The acting is superb on all fronts with standout performances by Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner. Each of the main characters creates a likeable persona. And what makes this movie a must-see (because the plot leaves much to be desired) is the ability of the on-screen characters to create a personal connection with the audience. Several of the scenes in this film are absolutely hilarious, such as the ones with Joseph (Graham Greene). Maverick isn't the type of movie that will win Academy Awards or leave one pondering the fundamental principles of the universe, but it is a whole lot of fun. And if you want to do is laugh, give this movie a try...The DVD Report",4,A highly original Western comedy...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2871,"['1990', 'Western', 'comedy', 'featuring', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Maverick', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'theaters', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'so', 'seriously', 'many', 'films', 'Western', 'setting', 'tend', 'do', 'Based', '1950', 'television', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'James', 'Garner', 'had', 'starring', 'role', 'Maverick', 'uniquely', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'adventure', 'comedy', 'When', 'Bret', 'Maverick', 'Mel', 'Gibson', '25,000', 'enter', 'winner-take-all', 'poker', 'tournament', 'towns', 'route', 'tournament', 'hopes', 'winning', 'dollar', 'quickly', 'Angel', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'roughneck', 'poker', 'player', 'own', 'right', 'who', 'kill', 'Maverick', 'attempt', 'inevitably', 'way', 'Maverick', 'up', 'Ms.', 'Annabelle', 'Bransford', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'slick', 'conniving', 'poker', 'player', 'who', 'Maverick', 'pocket', 'following', 'brief', 'romantic', 'encounter', 'When', 'Maverick', 'wash', 'shirt', 'punishment', 'Shrinking', 'designer', 'shirt', 'Annabelle', 'catch', 'riverboat', 'Maverick', 'running', 'boarding', 'boat', 'two', 'are', 'joined', 'Marshal', 'Zane', 'Cooper', 'James', 'Garner', 'kind', 'retired', 'sheriff', 'famous', 'West', 'Cooper', 'chivalry', 'hospitality', 'greatly', 'Maverick', 'brisk', 'demeanor', 'when', 'dealing', 'Ms.', 'Bransford.As', 'three', 'travel', 'cross', 'country', 'face', 'series', 'pitfalls', 'such', 'dead', 'coach', 'driver', 'who', 'almost', 'coach', 'top', 'cliff', 'showdown', 'hundreds', 'Indians', 'Maverick', 'financial', 'dealings', 'Archduke', 'Russia', 'Separated', 'confusion', 'three', 'eventually', 'meet', 'again', 'Riverboat', 'Lauren', 'Belle', 'home', 'championship', 'poker', 'game', 'hosted', 'riverboat', 'owner', 'Commodore', 'Duvall', 'Making', 'use', 'quick', 'wit', 'Maverick', 'extra', 'cash', 'join', 'poker', 'game', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'thousand', 'extra', 'Annabelle', 'Bransford', 'Commodore', 'Duvall', 'Marshal', 'Zane', 'Cooper', 'charge', 'guarding', '500,000', 'entry', 'fees', 'tournament', 'Angel', 'also', 'be', 'participant', 'addition', 'beating', 'Angel', 'Maverick', 'other', 'obstacles', 'even', 'greater', 'challenge', 'Overall', 'Maverick', 'great', 'entertainment', 'acting', 'superb', 'fronts', 'standout', 'performances', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'James', 'Garner', 'main', 'characters', 'likeable', 'persona', 'what', 'movie', 'must-see', 'plot', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'ability', 'on-screen', 'characters', 'create', 'personal', 'connection', 'audience', 'Several', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'such', 'ones', 'Joseph', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Maverick', ""n't"", 'type', 'movie', 'will', 'win', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'leave', 'one', 'pondering', 'fundamental', 'principles', 'universe', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'want', 'do', 'laugh', 'give', 'movie', 'try', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

Spectacular shots of the West - shot in Yosemite.  Mel Gibson is looking old - like early 40s - but his blue eyes and long lashes are still something.  He's too comic here, as he has been of late.  I much preferred him in ""Mrs. Soffell"" and ""Hamlet"".  And James Garner was perfect - all cool to Gibson's manic energy.  And tons and tons of cameos, from Danny Glover, to Doug McClure, to Robert Fuller.  But Gibson was not as smooth as Garner in the original ""Maverick"", nor in fact did he seem to have the same confidence in himself.  The movie was entertaining but gimmicky, from the borrowings from ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Raiders"" to Graham Greene's wisecracking Indian.  It was just a little too precious.

Graham Greene provided an interesting twist as Maverick's Native American partner who is forced to play up to a Russian Archduke in order to make ends meet.But the climax was the poker game, watched over closely by James Garner and James Coburn where a few familiar faces from other Richard Donner movies make appearances and Maverick learns how good a card sharp he really is.

My concern that Garner had been replaced by Mel Gibson and been relegated to a mere cameo was misplaced, as by the end of the film I realised that his role was just as important. The television series from the 1950s to 1980s showed us Bret, Brent, Beau and a number of other Mavericks, but it is Garner's original which really works best. Garner has a knack of portraying a loveable rogue and even here, in his late sixties he still possesses a handsome charm.But my praise of Garner doesn't mean Gibson wasn't up to the job. He is well cast, bringing a macho charm to the role and appealing to the ladies in exactly the same way as Garner. There are some good satirical scenes with the American Indians and some nice set pieces on the paddle steamer (the costumes are beautiful). Jodie Foster too acquits herself well and for one manages to rid herself of that annoying accent.The story centres on Maverick's plot to attend a huge poker tournament on a riverboat and get away with all the takings.

Gibson, we learn, is heading for what is, for lack of a better term, ""the World Series of Poker"" and needs to come by an extra $5,000 to make his entry fee. On the way he has many adventures that make up the story. Somebody is trying to keep Maverick from getting to the big game, but who? There are many twists and turns and the final outcome is hard to predict as it so well played out by all and sundry.Maverick, of course, is Mel Gibson - his main support is provided by fellow gambler Jodie Foster, who plays a disarmingly charming yet deadly wench. On the other side we have veteran James Garner, the original Maverick from the TV series. Garner is Marshall Zane Cooper, who guards the $500,000 in entry fees. Alfred Molina plays a tough hombre who seems to be stalking Maverick.The supporting cast is almost a who's who of old western movie stars like James Coburn, Denver Pyle, William Smith, Doug McClure, and Dub Taylor. You'll doubtless spot more familiar faces as even Mel's ""Lethal Weapon"" partner Danny Glover gets into the act in a laugh out loud moment. Superior kudos must go to Graham Green, who plays a Plains Indian who is a scamming partner of Maverick's.

If you own the DVD of this movie (and have watched it on a large-screen, HD TV), you know that the DVD transfer was simply awful--almost unwatchable due to the heavy grain and other video defects.The upgrade to Blu-ray is definitely worth the additional purchase price (less than thirteen dollars at Best Buy).

The audio is equally impressive--almost like watching a new release.The film itself is, of course, quite entertaining--wonderful cast (Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, James Colburn, James Garner, Graham Greene, and Alfred Molina), breath taking cinematography (filming took place at a number of scenic locations in the American West including Yosemite National Park, the Columbia River in Oregon, and the Arizona desert), a crazy plot (it's basically a comedy involving a big poker game aboard a fancy river boat--but there is plently of action), cameos by a number of country western singers (who perform a fantastic rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" as the ending credits roll) and a PG-13 rating, so the whole family can watch it.This upgrade to Blu-ray is highly recommended!",5,Blu ray Disc is HUGE upgrade from DVD,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,1525,"['writing', 'May', '28', '2011', 'Best', 'Buy', 'exclusively', 'Blu-ray', 'release', '1994', 'western/comedy/action', 'movie', 'Maverick', 'BD', 'definitely', 'huge', 'improvement', 'DVD', 'video', 'audio', 'own', 'DVD', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'large-screen', 'HD', 'TV', 'know', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'was', 'simply', 'awful', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'due', 'heavy', 'grain', 'other', 'video', 'defects.The', 'upgrade', 'Blu-ray', 'definitely', 'worth', 'additional', 'purchase', 'price', 'less', 'thirteen', 'dollars', 'Best', 'Buy', 'watching', 'totally', 'different', 'movie', 'BD', 'video', 'sharp', 'skin', 'tones', 'are', 'perfect', 'color', 'saturation', 'rich', 'still', 'natural', 'rate', 'video', 'transfer', '8/10', 'solid', 'transfer', 'especially', 'older', 'film', 'audio', 'equally', 'impressive', 'almost', 'watching', 'new', 'release.The', 'film', 'course', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'James', 'Colburn', 'James', 'Garner', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'breath', 'taking', 'cinematography', 'filming', 'took', 'place', 'number', 'scenic', 'locations', 'American', 'West', 'including', 'Yosemite', 'National', 'Park', 'Columbia', 'River', 'Oregon', 'Arizona', 'desert', 'crazy', 'plot', 'basically', 'comedy', 'involving', 'big', 'poker', 'game', 'fancy', 'river', 'boat', 'plently', 'action', 'cameos', 'number', 'country', 'western', 'singers', 'who', 'perform', 'fantastic', 'rendition', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'ending', 'credits', 'roll', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'it.This', 'upgrade', 'Blu-ray', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

A woman is playing poker and picking pockets. A Marshall is robbing the bank of a poker competition, with the agreement of the organizer. All kinds of players who are cheating and trying to win with weapons or violence, or even unfair padlocks. Indians who are organizing wagon train attacks for some dollars and the killing of some fake Indians still for a lot of money from a Russian ambassador. In one word everything is false, a big lie and a big laugh between or among the gun fire and the bullets. And yet all those crooks are trying to steal one another and the only woman in the tale will get the last word, except that she will only get a small part of the stake. Never put all your eggs in one basket. The only real interest of this film is not to show you what the far west used to be but to make you enjoy a comedy about it and that comedy is of course absurd. And that's why it is funny with some good actors who can play surprise and fear and joy and pleasure (you see the one I mean) and horror just as if the rattle snake under their feet were a real rattle snake. It sounds like one all right but it is nothing but a fake plastic rattling device and it won't bite. Even though they had a rattle snake tamer on the team, or rather because. I guess he is the one who dubbed them for the rattling to sound really real. Speaking of Canada Dry.

The script is a hoot and a half, filled to the brim with plot twists, gorgeous scenery, excellent costuming, and great performances.  Mel Gibson makes a fine Bret Maverick; he has Bret behaving as I would expect the character to do in certain situations, and I loved watching poor Bret being driven up a wall by everybody calling him ""Bert"". Jodie Foster is great as Annabelle Bransford, a sly con-artist who looks and acts so much like Samantha Crawford, an equally sly con-artist from the old ""Maverick"" series, that it wouldn't have surprised me one bit if it had been revealed that Annabelle was Samantha's own daughter.  James Garner is wonderful as Bret Maverick, Sr. (aka lawman Zane Cooper); watching him reprise the role that made him famous was like returning to my younger days of enjoying many TV Westerns.  The riverboat gambling tournament was nostalgic and sprinkled with familiar -- if fleeting -- faces from TV Westerns past:  Robert Fuller (Laramie), Doug McClure (The Virginian), Henry Darrow (The High Chaparral), Leo Gordon (a Warner Brothers contract player who appeared on many of ABC's Westerns in the late 1950s/early 1960s).  The dialogue is too modern-day in some spots (the Amerindian character Joseph talks like he's from the 21st century), but they couldn't have done this Western like one from the 1950s or it would have been too archaic for today's movie-goers.  The language is saltier, of course, but that was to be expected and I didn't have a problem with it.  Yet there's one line of dialogue in the scene where the younger Bret Maverick confronts the bandits who robbed a missionary wagon train.  They're busy calling him ""Bert"" when suddenly one of them says, ""You're all right, Bart.""  A funny misprounciation, yes, but I believe it's also a nod to the late Jack Kelly, who co-starred with James Garner in the ""Maverick"" TV series as Bart Maverick, the brother of Bret Sr.",5,"""Maverick"" Rebooted For the Big Screen",1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,2024,"['first', 'thought', 'would', 'dislike', '1994', 'movie', 'version', 'favorite', 'TV', 'Western', 'ended', 'up', 'loving', 'script', 'hoot', 'half', 'filled', 'brim', 'plot', 'twists', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'excellent', 'costuming', 'great', 'performances', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'fine', 'Bret', 'Maverick', 'Bret', 'behaving', 'would', 'expect', 'character', 'do', 'certain', 'situations', 'loved', 'watching', 'poor', 'Bret', 'being', 'driven', 'up', 'wall', 'everybody', 'calling', 'Bert', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'great', 'Annabelle', 'Bransford', 'sly', 'con-artist', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'Samantha', 'Crawford', 'equally', 'sly', 'con-artist', 'old', 'Maverick', 'series', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'surprised', 'one', 'bit', 'had', 'been', 'revealed', 'Annabelle', 'was', 'Samantha', 'own', 'daughter', 'James', 'Garner', 'wonderful', 'Bret', 'Maverick', 'Sr.', 'aka', 'lawman', 'Zane', 'Cooper', 'watching', 'reprise', 'role', 'made', 'famous', 'was', 'returning', 'younger', 'days', 'enjoying', 'many', 'TV', 'Westerns', 'riverboat', 'gambling', 'tournament', 'was', 'nostalgic', 'sprinkled', 'familiar', 'fleeting', 'TV', 'Westerns', 'past', 'Robert', 'Fuller', 'Laramie', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'Virginian', 'Henry', 'Darrow', 'High', 'Chaparral', 'Leo', 'Gordon', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'contract', 'player', 'who', 'appeared', 'many', 'ABC', 'Westerns', 'late', '1950s/early', '1960s', 'dialogue', 'too', 'modern-day', 'spots', 'Amerindian', 'character', 'Joseph', 'talks', '21st', 'century', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'Western', 'one', '1950s', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'archaic', 'today', 'movie-goers', 'language', 'saltier', 'course', 'was', 'be', 'expected', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'one', 'line', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'where', 'younger', 'Bret', 'Maverick', 'bandits', 'who', 'robbed', 'missionary', 'wagon', 'train', ""'re"", 'busy', 'calling', 'Bert', 'when', 'suddenly', 'one', ""'re"", 'right', 'Bart', 'funny', 'misprounciation', 'yes', 'believe', 'also', 'nod', 'late', 'Jack', 'Kelly', 'who', 'co-starred', 'James', 'Garner', 'Maverick', 'TV', 'series', 'Bart', 'Maverick', 'brother', 'Bret', 'Sr']",N/A

98358,AWA0CA9AYL5YQ,0790731940,Jennifer Litchfield,"[2, 4]","Maverick is an excellent example of why silly humour works but stupid humour doesn't.  It is at its best during the verbal and physical sparring between Mel Gibson and a likeably feisty Jodie Foster, but also occasionally plumbs the depths of incredibly unfunny ridiculousness.  Viewers familiar with the previous films of Gibson and director Richard Donner will appreciate the 'in' jokes liberally scattered throughout, and there are also some cameo appearances from a plethora of well-known country and western personalities.Western movies aren't produced in such great numbers as they once were, so the setting is a refreshing change from the generic cityscape so often used in comedies.  Donner pokes fun at the dusty landscape and makes use of its well-worn stereotypes, but also hits some uncomfortable home truths, such as the displacement of native Americans.But the spatial setting is only peripheral to that all-consuming game, poker.  Bret Maverick wants to enter the All Rivers poker contest; the stumbling block being the entry fee of $25,000.  As it is, Southern belle Annabelle Bransford is all too willing to relieve him of what cash he has.  Chaperoned by respected lawman Zane Cooper they set off on a madcap money-hunt through the Wild West, helping stranded missionaries and avoiding old foes out for vengeance (including an unbelievably stupid sequence involving a Russian archduke with a penchant for killing).The plot meanders along for three-quarters of the movie's length until suddenly we are bombarded with multi-layered double-crossings, which may require a second viewing to satisfactorily disentangle.

The entry fee is 25,000 and the prize is half a million dollars. He has most of his stake and lots of people owe him money but everything seems to go wrong as he tries to collect the money due him, always with hilarious results. As he makes his way towards to tournament, he encounters another gambler, played by Jodie Foster, who also wants to enter the tournament. She too is a bit short of a stake and will stop at nothing to get into the tournament and this includes playing the vamp and the pickpocket.

He has been hired to provide security.As they make their way to the big event, all three of the protagonists take their shots at the others. The Indians get involved and come across as the funniest, most honest and most intelligent people around.

98363,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,0790731940,John Kwok,"[0, 1]","Richard Donner's ""Maverick"" probably deserves ample recognition as among the funniest westerns ever made since Mel Brooks's ""Blazin' Saddles"". Based on the atypical 1960s television western starring James Garner, Mel Gibson does a great job taking over from Garner as the suave, debonair gambler Brett Maverick, en route to the World Series of Poker in Saint Louis, Missouri. He joins forces with  a younger, ambitious gambler Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster), who is as sly as a fox, older U. S. marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) and a sympathetic Indian pal (Graham Greene). Both Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster are hysterically funny, giving us two of their finest portrayals in their long cinematic careers. Along the way they have to contend with a devious gambler (Alfred Molina) and a whole colorful assortment of other ill-mannered Wild West bad guys (Many of these are portrayed by some legendary actors from the great Hollywood westerns, like James Coburn and Denver Pyle.). Donner does a fine job directing his cast, which apparently had a lot of fun making this film since the chemistry amongst Gibson, Foster and Garner is absolutely superb.",5,"Funny, Slapstick Western Pays Homage to Original TV Series  And Then Some....",1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,1153,"['Richard', 'Donner', 'Maverick', 'probably', 'ample', 'recognition', 'funniest', 'westerns', 'ever', 'made', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Blazin', 'Saddles', 'Based', 'atypical', '1960s', 'television', 'western', 'starring', 'James', 'Garner', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'great', 'job', 'taking', 'over', 'Garner', 'suave', 'debonair', 'gambler', 'Brett', 'Maverick', 'en', 'route', 'World', 'Series', 'Poker', 'Saint', 'Louis', 'Missouri', 'forces', 'younger', 'ambitious', 'gambler', 'Annabelle', 'Bransford', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'as', 'sly', 'fox', 'older', 'U.', 'S.', 'marshal', 'Zane', 'Cooper', 'James', 'Garner', 'sympathetic', 'Indian', 'pal', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'are', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'giving', 'two', 'finest', 'portrayals', 'long', 'cinematic', 'careers', 'way', 'have', 'contend', 'devious', 'gambler', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'whole', 'colorful', 'assortment', 'other', 'ill-mannered', 'Wild', 'West', 'bad', 'guys', 'Many', 'are', 'portrayed', 'legendary', 'actors', 'great', 'Hollywood', 'westerns', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Denver', 'Pyle.', 'Donner', 'fine', 'job', 'directing', 'cast', 'apparently', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'making', 'film', 'chemistry', 'amongst', 'Gibson', 'Foster', 'Garner', 'absolutely', 'superb']",N/A

The director is in full control here, and he does a whiz-bang job. The storyline, action and comedy flow along as smooth as buttermilk, and the cast: it couldn't be better. It was a gamble (pun intended) for any actor to try to step into the boots of James Garner, the original television Bret Maverick (here, very amusingly cast as a lawman of sorts)---but Mel pulls it off handsomely. He captures the character's offbeat charm perfectly, and even when he's being less than above-board, we can't help but root for his Maverick, because----as Jodie Foster's ""Mrs. Bransford"" puts it: ""There he goes, bein' all likable again.""  Foster herself is an absolute delight, in an atypical role as a faux-Southern belle with a slightly tarnished clapper. (Think that'll get by the mighty Amazon Censor?) She oozes ""oomph"" here, and has a smoldering chemistry with Gibson. It's a mystery as to why a sequel didn't appear...possibly because the screenplay by William Goldman is so hard to top.

Of course, how could this film have missed given its cast; Mel Gibson, James Garner, Jodie Foster, James Coburn and a whole slew of other stars to include an outrageously funny cameo by Danny Glover.  The more interesting thing here is that James Garner played Brett Maverick when it was a television series many moons ago and he had turned down many film scripts for this one where he didn't even play the lead.  Maverick is a big hit and all involved in making this fine western/comedy deserve all of the accolades they received for it!The premise:Bert, oops I mean Brett Maverick (Mel Gibson) is a card playing and fast drawing hustler who is on his way to good old St. Louis for a huge poker tournament.  His main problem is that he's three thousand dollars short of the entry fee so he decides to stop in another town and play another round of poker in the hopes of picking up some of the three thousand he needs.  This is where he meets Annabelle Branford played by the ever beautiful Jodie Foster.  Mrs. Branford's beauty is matched only by her desire to pick up the money to enter the big poker game as well.  Not too long afterwards we meet Zane Cooper (James Garner) who is a lawman of some fame and he just happens to be going the same way as Maverick and Mrs. Branford.  What follows is most definitely one of the most hilarious westerns ever made.  I would highly recommend this film to any and all fans of the stars and this genre.Special Features:Production notes:  This particular DVD is ""all"" about the film itself as there is very little in the way of special features.

It  suceeds, almost. Gibson is the title character, a  cleverly smooth  gambler/con man who's quite nimble with a gun but far nimbler with his  mouth. His wits are matched par exellance with the introduction of  Annabella Bransford (Foster), who's given new definition to the way the  game is played. Gibson and Foster are both great when together, both having  a natural flair for situation comedy. When the final stakes are set, the  biggest poker game of the year, the jokers are out to play and the cards  are indeed wild. All the leads equip themesleves wonderfully with southern  accents and the setting embraces the west of yesteryear but the plot leaves  far too many loopholes and the running time dosen't quite help conceal  them.

Mel Gibson does a fine job of playing the son of the first Maverick, James Garner, who costars in this film.

98409,ARFCORBCTKX1J,0790731940,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[3, 13]","I should warn prospective buyers that the Blu-ray transfer is almost as disappointing as the film. It's excessively soft * (eye-straining on a large display) and virtually grain-free, suggesting that heavy grain reduction was used. Not good -- not good at all. They should also be aware that the Blu-ray is available from at least one other source for considerably less.""Maverick"" should have been a truly great entertainment, a classic film, close in quality to ""Superman"". (Really.) It's /so/ disappointing that ""disaster"" seems the only valid adjective.Its origin is the classic '50s TV Western, with James Garner and Jack Kelly alternating as Bret and Bart Maverick, quick-witted gamblers. America took James Garner to its collective heart, and made him (arguably) the most-belov&eacute;d TV actor ever, even unto this day. Women adored him -- my mother drooled.So how do you make a lousy film from such good material? Richard Donner has been blamed -- one critic said of this film ""Stop him before he directs again!"". Donner's failure is not so much poor direction (though it appears everyone was having too much of a good time to pay close attention to what was going on in front of the camera), but not recognizing what a lousy script he'd been handed -- then doing something about it.The William Goldman script is a major problem. Goldman doesn't know the basics of good screenwriting, such as terse dialog, ** and scenes or sequences that build from a start and develop to an end. (Ever heard of Beethoven, Bill?) The script is notably devoid of comic or dramatic tension, and the un-con-voluted plot doesn't help, either. (One expects Bret to be in on a couple of major cons, not just the one at the end.) The twists and turns are left for the finale, none of them particularly surprising.Goldman's dialog is spectacularly flat and unamusing. Example... When Bret crawls on top of the runaway stagecoach to stop it, Coop (Garner) asks if the driver is asleep. Bret's witty reply... ""No, he's dead."" Duh... How about ""He's got a bad case of not breathing""? Or even ""Yeah... The big sleep."" Not brilliant, but at least an /attempt/ to be funny in a film that's supposed to be a comedy. Mr Goldman, you cannot build a comedy with bricks of ""on the nose"" dialog.The other major problem is Gibson's severely limited acting range. ""Wit"" and ""intelligence"" are not qualities one associates with Mr Gibson. Unfortunately, they /are/ qualities one associates with Bret Maverick, and James Garner so marvelously displayed. Gibson knows how to play ""goofy"" (as in Three Stooges goofy), but no idea of how to be witty. His Bret Maverick is an undisciplined doofus, absolutely /not/ the sort of behavior one expects from a successful gambler. It doesn't help that, standing next to Garner, he looks like a scrawny li'l runt.James Garner made a /career/ of playing what might be called a ""professional coward"". His characters -- in ""Maverick"", ""Nichols"", ""The Americanization of Emily"", and even ""The Rockford Files"" -- are acutely aware of the odds, and prefer not to get involved unless those odds heavily favor success. But Gibson's Maverick admits he's ""spineless"", and too-often acts foolishly -- especially letting his head be turned by a pretty face (particularly when she's a gambler), and allowing her to repeatedly lift his billfold. In short, Mel Gibson's Bret Maverick AIN'T James Garner's Bret Maverick, and the comparison, as the British say, is odious.Gibson's playing Maverick like Clark Kent works against us believing the character as a ""swave"" operator around women. His first private encounter with Jodi Foster is remarkably tensionless and unconvincing, partly due to Goldman's poor dialog.If your level of expectation is extremely low, you /might/ enjoy this film. But those who grew up with the witty original are likely to react with loud braying. This is a jackass of a movie.* No, it is /not/ my player (Sony BDP-S550) or display (KURO 151). The disk's splash panel is almost eye-rippingly sharp.** By terse, I mean ""every word counts"".

To sum up the film, it is just a plain fun. Richard Donner and Mel Gibson take their collaboration from the LETHAL WEAPON films (and even take Danny Glover along for a hilarious cameo as far as even saying ""I'm getting too old for this  ----!"") to make a very satisfying comedy-adventure-western.  Everyone seems to be having a good time in this film and the audience is brought along for the ride.  James Garner who originated the roll on tv is brought back as Marshall Zane Cooper.  Mel Gibson is perfectly cast in the lead and is so likeable and engaging that no matter what predicament he gets himself into, he's going to get out of it.  The plot is mainly Maverick trying to get to, and raise funds for, a poker tournament on a Louisiana steamboat. Along the way he runs into hilarious obstacles and miscreant while meeting up with unsavory charactors etc.  Jody Foster on the heels of two major best-actress Oscar wins, plays it light and is surprisingly hilarious as card shark/con artist Annabelle Bransford. Alfred Molina (SPIDER-MAN 2) shows his versatility once again as bad-guy  ""Angel"", Maverick's arch enemy. Graham Greene is hilarious as the politically incorrect Native American,Joseph who is after the mighty dollar. Also, a who's who of veteran tv and movie character actors appear in the film during the marathon poker tournament making it fun to point them out.
