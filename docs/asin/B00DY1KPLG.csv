For a fan though this DVD is definitely a must-have.  The story is about a group of girls in high school who have to go on an adventure.  One girl wishes her sister is gone, so she will finally be noticed, and with that comes more wishes and trouble.  The fashions are adorable and while they are various monsters (vampires, beasts, various animals and so forth) they are not really scary - my 2 year old daughter actually watched it and like it.  This is a great DVD for any girl who is not all pink and Barbies, its a story of girls who are unique and monster-like.  The colors are bright and the fashions are funky, very cute to watch.

1662483,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B00DY1KPLG,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[4, 5]","This is the fourth Monster High DVD release after:""New Ghoul at School"", which was the 1st TV special, only made available in limited editions of the Dawn of the Dance series of dolls:Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Ghoulia Yelps Doll with exclusive DVD,Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Cleo De Nile Doll with exclusive DVD,Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Lagoona Blue Doll with exclusive DVD,Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Deuce Gorgon Doll with exclusive DVD, andMonster High Dawn Of The Dance 3 Pack: Clawdeen Wolf, Draculaura, and Frankie Stein Dolls with exclusive DVD,until recently when it was reissued as a retailer exclusive both separately and as part of a 2-pack with:Monster High: Clawesome Double Feature - Fright On! / Escape from Skull Shores, which contains the 2nd and 4th TV specials respectively.Monster High: Double Feature - Friday Night Frights / Why Do Ghouls Fall in Love?, which contains the 5th and 3rd TV specials respectively.Monster High: Ghouls Rule, which was the 6th TV special.This movie begins in the distant past when disaster is narrowly averted by the genie, Gigi Grant, who just barely prevents her shadow sister Whisp from tricking the most recent Finder of the Lantern into wishing her All Powerful, during a solar eclipse, which would have made it permanent, but it's a narrow escape.  Lessons have been learned, and tools have been destroyed, meaning that the next time the lantern is found just prior to a solar eclipse, the Day might not get Saved after all....Is anyone surprised that said Next Time turns out to be at Monster High?  It is the start of a new school year, and everyone it seems has wishes for it,...and don't we viewers just know that they are all going to turn out disastrously?Clawdeen Wolf's younger sister Howleen is the Finder this time, and to her credit her first four wishes are almost entirely selfless, which doesn't mean they aren't going to turn out disastrously, but by her 5th wish Howleen is falling into temptation and being corrupted by Whisp into abusing her power.  By her 7th wish, Whisp has gotten Howleen to start banishing people into the lantern and replacing them with Shadow versions, but that's turning out to be a double-edged sword because by now these ghouls have a great deal of experience at being a pretty good team.  Soon the steadily augmenting force of ghoulfriends banished into the lantern is in a race against time to reassemble the tool that defeated Whisp before,...before Whisp can get Howleen to wish her All Powerful during the coming eclipse.  Though I found the ending a bit eye-rolling-ly pollyannaish, I thoroughly enjoyed the several running gags: Lagoona as the fresh water creature of Gil's worst nightmares, Clawd, Heath, and Manny Taur trying to survive the most insanely dangerous reality TV show for moronsters, and Cleo's increasingly desperate attempts to become popular again after Howleen has wished her into a Nobody.  The most intriguing new character that viewers will want to see more of turned out to be Twyla, daughter of the Boogieman, a quiet voice of reason that goes too often ignored by her BFF Howleen,... and pretty much everyone else until it is ALMOST too late.  Gently Pushed Moral: Be careful what you wish for (of course).Note: The DVD contains three (formerly) exclusive ""webisodes"" now watchable for free on the Monster High web site:119 Department of Monster Vehicles120 Royal Pest Sitter121 Cookie Creeperalong with the very first Ever After High ""webisode"": The World of Ever After High, and it should be noted that the events of ""Monster High: 13 Wishes"" clearly place Monster High and Ever After High in the same universe,...so now you'll have to buy your Monster High obsessed daughter the Ever After High dolls as well (insert evil laugh here)!...  Hey, at least they haven't worked Barbie into the same universe...yet.Note: A retailer exclusive version ofMonster High: 13 Wishes DVD with Exclusive Lunch Bagis available, and the insulated lunch bag included appears surprisingly well made for a freebie.Note: The next Monster High DVD releaseMonster High: Frights, Camera, Action!, which contains the 10th TV special, is now available.",5,I Dream of Genie with the Light Brown Scare,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,4179,"['fourth', 'Monster', 'High', 'DVD', 'release', 'New', 'Ghoul', 'School', 'was', '1st', 'TV', 'special', 'only', 'made', 'available', 'limited', 'editions', 'Dawn', 'Dance', 'series', 'dolls', 'Monster', 'High', 'Dawn', 'Dance', 'Ghoulia', 'Yelps', 'Doll', 'exclusive', 'DVD', 'Monster', 'High', 'Dawn', 'Dance', 'Cleo', 'De', 'Nile', 'Doll', 'exclusive', 'DVD', 'Monster', 'High', 'Dawn', 'Dance', 'Lagoona', 'Blue', 'Doll', 'exclusive', 'DVD', 'Monster', 'High', 'Dawn', 'Dance', 'Deuce', 'Gorgon', 'Doll', 'exclusive', 'DVD', 'andMonster', 'High', 'Dawn', 'Dance', '3', 'Pack', 'Clawdeen', 'Wolf', 'Draculaura', 'Frankie', 'Stein', 'Dolls', 'exclusive', 'DVD', 'recently', 'when', 'was', 'reissued', 'retailer', 'exclusive', 'separately', 'part', '2-pack', 'Monster', 'High', 'Clawesome', 'Double', 'Feature', 'Fright', '/', 'Escape', 'Skull', 'Shores', '2nd', '4th', 'TV', 'specials', 'respectively.Monster', 'High', 'Double', 'Feature', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Frights', '/', 'Why', 'Do', 'Ghouls', 'Fall', 'Love', '5th', '3rd', 'TV', 'specials', 'respectively.Monster', 'High', 'Ghouls', 'Rule', 'was', '6th', 'TV', 'special.This', 'movie', 'distant', 'past', 'when', 'disaster', 'narrowly', 'averted', 'genie', 'Gigi', 'Grant', 'who', 'just', 'barely', 'shadow', 'sister', 'Whisp', 'tricking', 'most', 'recent', 'Finder', 'Lantern', 'wishing', 'Powerful', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'permanent', 'narrow', 'escape', 'Lessons', 'have', 'been', 'learned', 'tools', 'have', 'been', 'destroyed', 'meaning', 'next', 'time', 'lantern', 'found', 'just', 'prior', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'Day', 'might', 'not', 'get', 'Saved', '.Is', 'anyone', 'surprised', 'said', 'Next', 'Time', 'out', 'be', 'Monster', 'High', 'start', 'new', 'school', 'year', 'everyone', 'wishes', 'do', ""n't"", 'viewers', 'just', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'disastrously', 'Clawdeen', 'Wolf', 'younger', 'sister', 'Howleen', 'Finder', 'time', 'credit', 'first', 'four', 'wishes', 'are', 'almost', 'entirely', 'selfless', ""n't"", 'mean', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'disastrously', '5th', 'wish', 'Howleen', 'falling', 'temptation', 'being', 'corrupted', 'Whisp', 'abusing', 'power', '7th', 'wish', 'Whisp', 'gotten', 'Howleen', 'start', 'banishing', 'people', 'lantern', 'replacing', 'Shadow', 'versions', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'double-edged', 'sword', 'now', 'ghouls', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'experience', 'being', 'pretty', 'good', 'team', 'steadily', 'augmenting', 'force', 'ghoulfriends', 'banished', 'lantern', 'race', 'time', 'reassemble', 'tool', 'defeated', 'Whisp', 'Whisp', 'can', 'get', 'Howleen', 'wish', 'All', 'Powerful', 'coming', 'eclipse', 'found', 'ending', 'bit', 'eye-rolling-ly', 'pollyannaish', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'several', 'running', 'gags', 'Lagoona', 'fresh', 'water', 'creature', 'Gil', 'worst', 'nightmares', 'Clawd', 'Heath', 'Manny', 'Taur', 'trying', 'survive', 'most', 'insanely', 'dangerous', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'moronsters', 'Cleo', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'become', 'popular', 'again', 'Howleen', 'wished', 'Nobody', 'most', 'intriguing', 'new', 'character', 'viewers', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Twyla', 'daughter', 'Boogieman', 'quiet', 'voice', 'reason', 'too', 'often', 'ignored', 'BFF', 'Howleen', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'ALMOST', 'too', 'late', 'Gently', 'Pushed', 'Moral', 'Be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'course', '.Note', 'DVD', 'contains', 'three', 'formerly', 'exclusive', 'webisodes', 'now', 'watchable', 'free', 'Monster', 'High', 'web', 'site:119', 'Department', 'Monster', 'Vehicles120', 'Royal', 'Pest', 'Sitter121', 'Cookie', 'Creeperalong', 'very', 'first', 'Ever', 'High', 'webisode', 'World', 'Ever', 'High', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'events', 'Monster', 'High', '13', 'Wishes', 'clearly', 'place', 'Monster', 'High', 'Ever', 'High', 'same', 'universe', 'so', 'now', ""'ll"", 'have', 'buy', 'Monster', 'High', 'obsessed', 'daughter', 'Ever', 'High', 'dolls', 'as', 'well', 'insert', 'evil', 'here', 'Hey', 'least', 'have', ""n't"", 'worked', 'Barbie', 'same', 'universe', 'yet.Note', 'retailer', 'exclusive', 'version', 'ofMonster', 'High', '13', 'Wishes', 'DVD', 'Exclusive', 'Lunch', 'Bagis', 'available', 'insulated', 'lunch', 'bag', 'included', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'made', 'freebie.Note', 'next', 'Monster', 'High', 'DVD', 'releaseMonster', 'High', 'Frights', 'Camera', 'Action', '10th', 'TV', 'special', 'now', 'available']",Monster High: 13 Wishes

Also liked how a lot of the wordage used had monster themes as well. Overall, thought that this was a rather well made film and was very good to watch, not insulting to young kids or older people like myself - I am a 50 year old male.

1662490,ACYWXDA8A8OW1,B00DY1KPLG,julian,"[20, 22]","I'm going to be completely honest here, I bought this movie for myself and I'm glad I did. My little cousin adored this movie and so did I. The thing I respect about these movies is that even though they're aimed for a little girl demographic, they still attempt to be likable for an older audience; That way it isn't painful for older family members to sit through. No matter what's going on in Monster High, there's ALWAYS something interesting to see; all of the designs are extremely creative and there's an abundance of Monster puns(Seriously, student DISEMBODIED president, why didn't I think of that?) The characters are extremely cute and likable and all the diverse monsters embrace they're quirks and it teaches kids to embrace what makes them unique. The major downside of this movie and all monster high movies is that it could be really clich&eacute;d; this wouldn't bother me too much but it's especially irksome because I think things like the the one-dimensional bully characters clash with the overall message of tolerance to others. But aside from that, the movie's are cute and fun for all ages. The fact that it genuinely makes an effort to be fun for everybody(and the fact that the animation is spooktacular!) is the reason why I'm an 18 year old male who can't wait for the next Monster High Blu-ray!",5,Freaky and Fabulous!,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,1323,"[""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'here', 'bought', 'movie', 'myself', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'My', 'little', 'cousin', 'adored', 'movie', 'so', 'did', 'thing', 'respect', 'movies', 'even', ""'re"", 'aimed', 'little', 'girl', 'demographic', 'still', 'attempt', 'be', 'likable', 'older', 'audience', 'way', ""n't"", 'painful', 'older', 'family', 'members', 'sit', 'matter', 'what', 'going', 'Monster', 'High', 'ALWAYS', 'something', 'interesting', 'see', 'designs', 'are', 'extremely', 'creative', 'abundance', 'Monster', 'puns', 'Seriously', 'student', 'DISEMBODIED', 'president', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'cute', 'likable', 'diverse', 'monsters', 'embrace', ""'re"", 'quirks', 'kids', 'embrace', 'what', 'unique', 'major', 'downside', 'movie', 'monster', 'high', 'movies', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'especially', 'irksome', 'think', 'things', 'one-dimensional', 'bully', 'characters', 'clash', 'overall', 'message', 'tolerance', 'others', 'aside', 'movie', 'are', 'cute', 'fun', 'ages', 'fact', 'genuinely', 'effort', 'be', 'fun', 'everybody', 'fact', 'animation', 'spooktacular', 'reason', 'why', ""'m"", '18', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'Monster', 'High', 'Blu-ray']",Monster High: 13 Wishes
