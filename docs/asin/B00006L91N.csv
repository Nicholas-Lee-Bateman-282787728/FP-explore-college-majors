719724,A19BWRT516SX6L,B00006L91N,"H. L. Mason ""relyonme""","[2, 2]","Here's an excellent film devoted to one of the more notorious trials of the infamous mafia don, John Gotti.  Having recently read about this particular subject, I found the film to be a really fine recreation of what I imagined Gotti and his thugs to be.  Lorraine Bracco does a great job in her role as the feisty prosecutor, as does Anthony Denison as Gotti. His lawyer, Bruce Cutler, is just about perfect, and the whole shebang is very convincing.  For anyone interested in this subject, I would highly recommend it.",4,VERY GOOD IN ITS GENRE,1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,520,"['Here', 'excellent', 'film', 'devoted', 'one', 'more', 'notorious', 'trials', 'infamous', 'mafia', 'don', 'John', 'Gotti', 'Having', 'recently', 'read', 'particular', 'subject', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'really', 'fine', 'recreation', 'what', 'imagined', 'Gotti', 'thugs', 'be', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'great', 'job', 'role', 'feisty', 'prosecutor', 'Anthony', 'Denison', 'Gotti', 'lawyer', 'Bruce', 'Cutler', 'just', 'perfect', 'whole', 'shebang', 'very', 'convincing', 'anyone', 'interested', 'subject', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend']",Getting Gotti

719729,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B00006L91N,Phil S.,"[4, 4]","Made in 1992 and about two years after the incredible Goodfellas and Bracco's fine performance, much of that electricity is felt in this based-on-a-true story film.The script is excellent, especially in FBI situations; the viewer can only assume that the script writer ""did his homework"". Regarding the ""Mob guy"" detail, there's all the cliches..but still believable. The supporting actors are every bit a strong as the leads.The inescapable reference to Goodfellas can show artistic shortcomings, as then the scenes too often play as if the Director stopped one take short of ""real"" - lines are not spoken, but *read*. Bracco does have that slightly draggy, flat style, and the creative result can be somewhat off-putting, with an unintended comic edge. But when she's engaged...dynamite! (Just like in the Scorsese film!).On the other hand, we have a great opportunity to see Lorraine in close-up and dominating many scenes. I think that Scorsese has a tendency to hold back the female leads, as he did with Bracco in Goodfellas and Sharon Stone in Casino.Film builds nicely...courtroom scenes are superb, though marred by overblown orchestration.The film may have been more successful commercially and according to genre had it been produced as a Made For TV Movie, parts one and two.  Armand Assante's 1996 ""Gotti"" was fine in that framework.",4,"Good movie, worth watching (3.5*)",1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,1346,"['Made', '1992', 'two', 'years', 'incredible', 'Goodfellas', 'Bracco', 'fine', 'performance', 'much', 'electricity', 'felt', 'based-on-a-true', 'story', 'film.The', 'script', 'excellent', 'especially', 'FBI', 'situations', 'viewer', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'script', 'writer', 'did', 'homework', 'Regarding', 'Mob', 'guy', 'detail', 'cliches..but', 'still', 'believable', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'bit', 'strong', 'leads.The', 'inescapable', 'reference', 'Goodfellas', 'can', 'show', 'artistic', 'shortcomings', 'then', 'scenes', 'too', 'often', 'play', 'Director', 'stopped', 'one', 'take', 'short', 'real', 'lines', 'are', 'not', 'spoken', '*read*', 'Bracco', 'have', 'slightly', 'draggy', 'flat', 'style', 'creative', 'result', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'off-putting', 'unintended', 'comic', 'edge', 'when', 'engaged', 'dynamite', 'Just', 'Scorsese', 'film', '.On', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'great', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Lorraine', 'close-up', 'dominating', 'many', 'scenes', 'think', 'Scorsese', 'tendency', 'hold', 'back', 'female', 'did', 'Bracco', 'Goodfellas', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Casino.Film', 'builds', 'nicely', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'are', 'superb', 'though', 'marred', 'orchestration.The', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'commercially', 'according', 'genre', 'had', 'been', 'produced', 'Made', 'TV', 'Movie', 'parts', 'one', 'two', 'Armand', 'Assante', '1996', 'Gotti', 'was', 'fine', 'framework']",Getting Gotti
