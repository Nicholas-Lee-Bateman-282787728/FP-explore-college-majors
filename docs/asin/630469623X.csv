The sad reality of the inner city blacks who embraced the ""thug life"" lifestyle is that his/her life options are either death or life in prison. For those who never witnessed or experienced the tragic experiences of a low income neighborhood or lived in a ghetto this movie depicts accurately how tough hard inner city teenagers speak, behave, and relate to one another. There will be images of intense violence, you will see the shattering of innocence, and cruelties of lives taken. But there is a message. The purpose of this movie when done in the 90s and even today is to teach young black that they must choose a different avenue of life outside of crime, violence, and death. However, the question remains till this day.

It's almost 20 years ago!!Ever since Blu Ray came out, I have been fiendin for some black films (mainly from the 70's.  Shaft and Superfly remastered with 5.1!) and they have taken their time!  Finally Do the Right Thing came out, but I guess that does not count as 'they' see that as Spike Lee's cinamatic masterpiece.  Well, now Friday, Set it Off and Menace II Society have come out.  I guess this will have to do until some of those 70's films come out...Looking at this film now, you forget that it is only a hour and a half!  The picture quality looked like Friday.  It had a film look, but not an exceptionally sharp look to it.  It was clear with film grain, but not dirty.  Detail was there, but it was no Kingdom of Heaven or The Incedible Hulk quality!  In fact, it looks like Do the Right Thing on BD, but slight less detailed.  So if you know how that is, then there you have it.  It is good quality and somewhat 3D, but not like blockbuster films.Now the sound, which is in Dolby TruHD and is on point!  I always felt like I was in the scenes that were being shown!  When they go to the prison or through a home with music playing and exit it, the music goes behind the action and is where it should be no matter the direction.  Once Caine leaves the house, the music is behind him.  In the prison, the people talking on the side stay on the side that they should be on regardless of orientation.  This is how surround sound should be done!  I was not expecting it from this film.If you like the movie, get it.  If you are expecting Sean Connery James Bond quality, then you may want to pass.  It looks like film and you feel that you are at the movies.  I guess that is what we want.Update:  I forgot to add that there is posterization in the film.

432376,AMF5LHI9IOIH1,630469623X,Irishgirl,"[8, 9]","A truly groundbreaking film about the harsh realities of life on the streets and hustling in the ghettos, 1993's ""Menace II Society"" gives us a poignant look at what can happen when wrong choices are made and when redeeming one's self is too late. This film also magnifies the pressures that many young African Americans must deal with on a daily basis.Meet Caine Lawson (a brilliant performance from Tyrin Turner). As a boy in the Watts, California hood with his heroin addict mother and murdering drug dealer father Tat (Samuel L. Jackson), was it any wonder that Caine would become drawn to a similar lifestyle? When his parents die, Caine is sent to live with his grandparents. Fresh out of high school, Caine hits the streets as a drug hustler trying to make money for expensive cars to attract the ladies and to take care of Ronnie (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Anthony, the family of his childhood role model Pernell who is in prison. It is a struggling situation between family/role model man, and the lure of the streets for Caine. Despite the preaching from his grandfather, trouble is always around the corner for Caine, especially when he's with his best friend O-Dog (a very convincing performance from (Larenz Tate), who is basically a don't give a f**k ticking time bomb waiting to explode. Besides being involved in a fatal convenience store shooting and being stalked by the police, Caine also struggles to keep himself alive. When his cousin gets killed and he himself gets shot, Caine realizes after talking with Ronnie that he needs to make a fresh start in life before it's too late. Traveling to Atlanta with her and Anthony may be the only thing that would save him. But there's no fighting the lure of street trouble; selling drugs, getting into mischief of O-Dog and the gang, getting back at the guys who killed his cousin and possibly impregnating a woman. But by the time Caine decides to go away with Ronnie and Anthony, his mistakes may have stirred up a hornet's nest that will come back to haunt him in the most tragic of ways. For Caine, it may be too late to redeem himself for good.This movie is an eye-opener and sends a very harsh and true message about upbringing, lifestyles and choices. Boozing, drugs, shooting, attacking, cruising and all the while trying to survive, get respect and rise above, not to mention being a role model. These are just a few of the things that mirror inner city life. You can run from the streets, but the streets will always be in you. This is what Caine must face. Awesome funky hip-hip soundtrack and some serious intense acting make this movie great. The street-wise lingo, the clothes, the attitude; all this pulls the movie together. Special features include an in-depth interview with the Hughes twins who directed the film, as well as the theatrical trailer, and more.

I've seen this movie numerously over the years and it still get to me. ""Menace II Society"" is a film that is so violent, depressing and real it seriously looks and feels like a documentary. Inside the first 20 minutes there are a few scenes that would be the climatic in the latter (Boyz n The Hood) purely because they contain outrageous violence, sadness and that feeling that you are watching something brilliant & depressing. It shows what a tenacious, vicious film this is- the normal, brutal ending to another film of misguided youth is purely an introductory, walk in the park for this.The film follows the venture of a young man, ""Caine"" (Tyrin Turner) in the hood. He is a part time drug-dealer, but even though the portrayal of his character isn't sympathetic, that emotion is still evoked at the same time as watching him and his friends manoeuvre through the 'hood. Caine's best friend, O- Dog (Larenz Tate) was never any hope. Seen ""Trainspotting""? O-Dog is a GD-up version of the psychotic, violent character ""Begbie"". He shoots people for fun, treats women in a degrading fashion and constantly annoys and makes fun of his friends. Other characters include Jada Pinkett-Smith, Bill Duke, and Samuel L Jackson, the last two only holding small roles in this movie.I'm not going to go into great depths into this film. It cannot do it justice. Every actor is superb, the script is impeccable and the violence is raw, uncut but informative. Watching this is like a documentary- you feel as if you are there, and by the end you won't be able to process what eventually happens. For me, it made me go numb. I'm never able to leave my seat for a few minutes. My advice: watch this for yourself.

432379,A34D06JL7LC6MU,630469623X,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 5]","Roger Ebert called this film one of the most powerful movies he'd ever seen. And yeah, I guess it is. This movie, directed by The Hughes Brothers(From Hell, Dead Presidents) portrays life in the hood as no other movie has done before. It's powerful, unapologetic, and presents us with characters that we should have no sympathy for whatsoever. Oddly enough though, we do.The movie begins with Caine (Tyrin Turner) and O-Dog (Larenz Tate) walking into a liquor store to buy some beer. The store is owned by Korean's who follow them around mysteriously. Caine and O-Dog go about their business until they're about to walk out and O-Dog shoots and kills both of the Korean's and takes the tape of them doing it. The scene shows us the violence unflinchingly. We then see Caine's back story. His father (Samuel L. Jackson) died in a drug deal and his mother died of a heroin overdose. He lived with his religious grandparents since then and was, for the most part, raised by Pernell (Glenn Plummer) who's now serving life in prison. Caine, meanwhile, helps take care of Pernell's girlfriend Ronnie (Jada Pinkett) andhis young son Anthony, who reminds Caine of himself at a young age. The rest of the movie is events that happen in the lives of Caine and his homiesO-Dog, Doc, Wax, Sharif, Stacy, Lew-Loc, and Chauncy. Drug deals, drive-by's, rim stealing, car jacking, cold blooded murder, you name it. None of it's off limits. Through all of this, however, you like the characters. O-Dog, no matter how violent and sadistic he gets is still a great and sympathetic character. Tate's performance is so good, I'm surprised he didn't get a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Tyrin Turner, who I've never seen in another movie, is amazing as Caine; Playing both the violent street thug and sensitive guy perfectly. A pre-Will Smith, Jada Pinkett is also great as Ronnieand should have gotten an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.This is an important movie that needs to be seen by a lot of people, since it confronts a lot of social issues in a simalar way movies like American History X, Boyz in the Hood, and even Scarface have done before.

432386,AW83CVXIX7RFI,630469623X,Mike,"[2, 4]","I was pretty young when this came out, I saw it in the movies. I saw it with a few of my friends, and I remember walking out of the theater wanting to blow someone away. I'm afraid that this is the depth that this movie has. One reviewer made a comment that there were too many characters that could have had more of an impact if thier stories were explained in more detail. In effect, if they were PEOPLE instead of just characters. I agree with him. At the end, when Kane (Tyrin Turner) is talking to Pernell (Glenn Plummer), **is there an ""urban"" flick that Glenn Plummer is NOT in?** when he says, ""When I was growing up, you were like my dad."" Now, the only other scene Glenn Plummer is in, is when he shows Kane at around the age of ten how to handle a gun. All I'm saying is if we had a little more background of Pernell and Kane, maybe we could have appreciated their relationship more. Instead we know next to nothing about it. I mean, how close were they if Kane has to ask Ronnie (Pernell's girl; Jada Pinkett) how he's doing in prison, and he never goes to see him? Some  scenes that might have supposed to have been powerful were actually laughable. For example, at the end when Ronnie is tyring to persuade Kane to leave with her, she goes from, ""Do you know what Anthony (her son) asked me the other day? If you were gonna die! If you were gonna die, Kane!"" to, ""Are you gonna go with me or what?"" Way to finish that off. The whole relationship between Kane and Ronnie is kind of icky anyway, Pernell being his ""dad"" and all. And also, earlier in the film when Kane is showing Anthony how to use a gun, (the only parenting skill he aquired) and Ronnie catches him, she immediatly flies off the handle; ""I don't want my son learning how to do drive by's!!"" She must all of a sudden forget that situation because her next line is ""How many times do I have to tell you to stop giving us money?"" Apparently her pride overpowers her motherly insticnts. I don't know if this was the Hughes Brothers first film, or even if they've made more since, but for what it was, it was an appluadable effort.

There's a picture of two black kids on the front.  OK, you read summary.  It doesn't tell you much.  So, by this point intrigued, you rent it.  Good for you.Menace starts out in a convience store.  There's confrontation, and soon, two people are dead.  The gunman is smiling and opening the register.  His friend, Kane, screams at him and shivers with panic.  We fade, and begin the story of Kane's life.If you're the average white person living in America, what you hear in rap music and see on the news must be very distant from you.Allen and Albert Hughes grapple us with their genius storytelling skills, and quickly, show us what we're so secure not to know.  The daily living, the blood, the drugs, the not caring.  What do these mean?  The main character, Kane, is mixed up in all of it.To himself, he wants out- way out- of his hoodlum life.  Externally however, he wants in.  He's never shot anybody, he's the clean one.  But he sells drugs.  He knows how to kill someone.  He's been friends with people who have.  Here we see his internal struggle to get out in stunning visual perspective.The film itself has an expert way about it of opening our eyes to the culture, the environment, the lack of consequences, the police brutality- All of it, while still maintaining assemblence of structure in where it wants to go.Most of this movie is painful to watch.  Seeing Kane fall down his path of righteousness and commit sins he scoffed his brethren for commiting just days earlier.  Seeing innocent lives be torn by misunderstanding.  Seeing utterly meanless death.  It should hurt to watch- the directors made sure of it- that's why it's so poignant.The aforementioned sins that Kane commits jump into his future as well.  Every time he has a chance to escape, he's pulled right back into the circle by something he himself did.  As Kane matures and finds his way, the circle flows into it.  It's reminicent of Michael Corleone in The Godfather.Some other noticible traits of the film- it's incredibly stylistic when it wants to be, but graphically gritty others.  Also, it does a good job of displaying irony- like a scene when Kane and friend walk down the street speaking of how the Bible won't help them- with crosses dangling from their necks.

While some has changed over the 20 years since this movie's release, you can bet there are still plenty of young, black men dealing with all that this movie tells you about the ghetto. In a lot of ways, you already know how it's going to end, but you still want to see it all play out in front of you.I grew up around people similar to the characters portrayed in this film and I have to tell you this story rings very true. Now that I am 35, I look back at all the people I knew then and thankfully, a lot of them got out of that lifestyle and turned things around. Sadly, some stayed and sure enough, the hood ate them alive.You'll see a young Jada Pinkett Smith here as well as Lorenz Tate who pulls off ""America's Nightmare"" rather well. The cameo by Samuel L Jackson is amazing. It took me a moment to realize it was him, but when I did, it sort of made sense for him to be in the film. Charles S Dutton also plays a smaller role, but he does a very good job.The film itself is gritty, violent, and real to life in Watts. There is plenty of cussing, drug use, drinking, and some incredibly violent acts. While some may think this film glorifies this sort of behavior, it also shows you how you can expect your life to turn out if you don't find a way out of the game.As far as the Blu Ray disc, the transfer was decent and the sound was better than some discs. You don't have to turn up the volume to hear the dialog which is a plus. I know the studios purposely do that so you can get more of a theater experience, but more often than not it's just a hassle. The picture looks alright and you can still see the grain of the film the movie was shot on back in the early nineties.The soundtrack is very good and has songs from an assortment of the popular rap and R&B; artists of the time. In fact, most fans of rap music look at the tracks and consider them as part of the golden age of the gangster rap genre (Approx: 1988 - 1994).In some ways, I wonder if this might be a film you'd want to show the so called gangsters of today. While the world has changed, there are still kids that think this is the kind of lifestyle they want, even those who do not live in a bad neighborhood. In a way, this is a movie they might be able to learn from. Sure, it shows some of the characters selling drugs and driving nice cars because of that, but it also shows the price you ultimately pay for leading this kind of lifestyle.3.9 / 5",4,"A Tragic, but Insightful Look Into Life in the Ghetto",1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,2538,"['remember', 'seeing', 'film', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'then', 'still', 'now', 'changed', '20', 'years', 'movie', 'release', 'can', 'bet', 'are', 'still', 'young', 'black', 'men', 'dealing', 'movie', 'ghetto', 'lot', 'ways', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'still', 'want', 'see', 'play', 'out', 'front', 'you.I', 'grew', 'up', 'people', 'similar', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'film', 'have', 'tell', 'story', 'very', 'true', 'Now', 'am', '35', 'look', 'back', 'people', 'knew', 'then', 'thankfully', 'lot', 'got', 'out', 'lifestyle', 'turned', 'things', 'Sadly', 'stayed', 'sure', 'enough', 'hood', 'ate', 'alive.You', ""'ll"", 'see', 'young', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Lorenz', 'Tate', 'who', 'America', 'Nightmare', 'rather', 'well', 'cameo', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'amazing', 'took', 'moment', 'realize', 'was', 'when', 'did', 'sort', 'made', 'sense', 'be', 'film', 'Charles', 'S', 'Dutton', 'also', 'smaller', 'role', 'very', 'good', 'job.The', 'film', 'gritty', 'violent', 'real', 'life', 'Watts', 'plenty', 'cussing', 'drug', 'use', 'drinking', 'incredibly', 'violent', 'acts', 'may', 'think', 'film', 'sort', 'behavior', 'also', 'how', 'can', 'expect', 'life', 'turn', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'way', 'game.As', 'far', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'transfer', 'was', 'decent', 'sound', 'was', 'better', 'discs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'hear', 'dialog', 'plus', 'know', 'studios', 'purposely', 'do', 'can', 'get', 'more', 'theater', 'experience', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'just', 'hassle', 'picture', 'alright', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'grain', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'back', 'early', 'nineties.The', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'good', 'songs', 'assortment', 'popular', 'rap', 'R', 'B', 'artists', 'time', 'fact', 'most', 'fans', 'rap', 'music', 'look', 'tracks', 'consider', 'part', 'golden', 'age', 'gangster', 'rap', 'genre', 'Approx', '1988', '1994', '.In', 'ways', 'wonder', 'might', 'be', 'film', ""'d"", 'want', 'show', 'so', 'called', 'gangsters', 'today', 'world', 'changed', 'are', 'still', 'kids', 'think', 'kind', 'lifestyle', 'want', 'even', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'bad', 'neighborhood', 'way', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'learn', 'Sure', 'characters', 'selling', 'drugs', 'driving', 'nice', 'cars', 'also', 'price', 'ultimately', 'pay', 'leading', 'kind', 'lifestyle.3.9', '5']",Menace II Society

432406,A2VKJKICHHOHNC,630469623X,S. T. H. Thesingh,"[3, 4]","I've probably seen this movie 20 times since it came out and I still watch it when it comes on television. I must say that some of the acting seems a bit corny now, but the images, characters and the story are still as gripping as ever. MIIS is basically a remake of the gangster classic Public Enemy from 1931. At that time Warner Brothers studios had directors that were interested in telling real stories. Another example also from 1931, I think, was I'm a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. Basically these films were about how life was in the early thirties for some people, like gangsters or poor people.Anyway MIIS does this too. People compare it to Boyz 'n' da Hood and Do the Right Thing. Why do the Right Thing? That movie has a completely different theme than this one. It deals directly with racism, MIIS deals indirectly with racism, but is about living a life of crime in the ghetto. Boy 'n' the hood is similar, but is a morality play and also coming of age drama. Just, because black people act and direct a movie doesn't mean it's exactly the same subject. MIIS is more a tragedy, as soon as you hear the voice over of Caine and he begins to tell his story you know that this is not going to end well.Furthermore the major part of the acting is great. Also a good thing is the dialogue in the script, it's all slang. When I first saw this movie I couldn't understand a word they were saying for the first ten minutes. This makes it more realistic, but also gives an almost Shakespeare like feel, because you have to listen with more effort to get the dialogue.Lastly for those people who say this film is racist and stereotypical. Please look a little bit further. Stereotypes are put forward yes, but not to characterize all young black men in the hood, they are stereotypes of individuals that exist, the nut, the player, the religious fanatic, the hustler etc. And even though they are stereotyped the actors do a really good job in deepening ther characters. I can't find any racism in this film with the best of my ability, I think the directors just wanted to make a film that would be very impressive and they succeeded in that.

Yates,"[3, 7]","ok, I've only just seen this film for the first time, so it's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect, but this is not a particularly good film.I mean, it has its choice moments where it really comes together. the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed. any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status. samuel jackson's in it. and if you're a fan of dave chapelle's tyrone biggums crackhead character, the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity.but that's really my problem with this film. serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting. and they're ALL here: the homey black grandparents, the nation of islam convert, the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine's road... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth.take the french film 'la haine', for instance. it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment. rather than just running through a laundry list of problems, one-by-one, scene-by-scene, it really gets to the heart of something bigger, some grander alienation that urban youths feel, which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do. plus, if you can believe it, the hip-hop in 'la haine' is quite a bit better.so while I would definitely recommend seeing this film, keep the remote aimed and ready, finger on the fast-forward button. maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching, whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising. oh yeah, and there's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason. oh, also, the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees. in a film that didn't try to carry so much social weight, that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking, but it really just cheapens this one.",2,maybe it just hasn't aged well...,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,2245,"['ok', ""'ve"", 'only', 'just', 'seen', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'hard', 'really', 'judge', 'social', 'impact', 'had', '13', 'years', 'ago', 'importance', 'respect', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'film.I', 'mean', 'choice', 'moments', 'where', 'really', 'together', 'shot', 'caine', 'downing', '40', 'korean', 'grocers', 'imaginitively', 'directed', 'scene', 'o-dog', 'almost', 'guaranteed', 'classic', 'status', 'samuel', 'jackson', ""'re"", 'fan', 'dave', 'chapelle', 'tyrone', 'biggums', 'crackhead', 'character', 'token', 'crackhead', 'film', 'few', 'laughs', 'to-the-tee', 'similarity.but', 'really', 'problem', 'film', 'serious', 'issues', 'are', 'reduced', 'series', 'ham-fisted', 'archetypes', 'straight', 'central', 'casting', ""'re"", 'here', 'homey', 'black', 'grandparents', 'nation', 'islam', 'convert', 'socially', 'conscious', 'mother', 'son', 'starting', 'go', 'down', 'caine', 'road', 'characters', 'might', 'fare', 'better', 'different', 'film', 'issues', 'more', 'subtlety', 'depth.take', 'french', 'film', 'haine', 'instance', 'clearly', 'took', 'lot', 'inspiration', 'menace', '2', 'society', 'boyz', 'n', 'tha', 'hood', 'etc.', 'characters', 'actually', 'feel', 'tormented', 'instead', 'just', 'having', 'lots', 'scenes', 'written', 'FOR', 'show', 'torment', 'rather', 'just', 'running', 'laundry', 'list', 'problems', 'one-by-one', 'scene-by-scene', 'really', 'heart', 'something', 'bigger', 'grander', 'alienation', 'urban', 'youths', 'feel', 'what', 'menace', '2', 'society', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'can', 'believe', 'hip-hop', ""'la"", 'haine', 'quite', 'bit', 'better.so', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'film', 'keep', 'remote', 'aimed', 'ready', 'finger', 'fast-forward', 'button', 'maybe', 'half-hour', 'film', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'other', '70', 'minutes', 'are', 'mostly', 'just', 'dull', 'moralising', 'oh', 'yeah', 'really', 'embarrassing-to-watch', 'sex', 'scene', 'thrown', 'particular', 'reason', 'oh', 'also', 'filmmakers', 'apparently', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'shot', 'look', 'are', 'being', 'electrocuted', 'spitting', 'out', 'cherry', 'slurpees', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'carry', 'so', 'much', 'social', 'weight', 'kind', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'ok', 'could', 'laugh', 'off', 'bad', 'filmmaking', 'really', 'just', 'one']",Menace II Society

432409,A9C375HSNCY9,630469623X,Trevor Cotton,"[6, 7]","Menace II Society was the debut film from the directing duo of the Hughes brothers, released in 1993 at the height of popularity of ""hood movies"".  As most other reviewers have stated the film is an extemely powerful look at growing up in L.A in the early 90's.  The movie grabs your attention straight away with the robbery of the liquor store and the controversial shooting of the Korean owners, and the pace never lets up throughout.  Caine (Tyrin Turner) is basically a bystander in the opening scene as O-Dog (Larenz Tate) goes on a rampage, and this continues throughout the film, Caine is a good person but very much a victim of his circumstances, whereas O-Dog just ""doesn't give a f**k"".Without going into plot details the events in the film all conspire against Caine and it all catches up with him in the inevitable ending.  There are also good performances from Jada Pinkett and MC Eiht and a small role at the start from Samuel L Jackson as Caine's father.  While the film is very powerful and a sad and realistic take on ghetto life, it is not without it's faults, the main one being the lack of depth of some of the characters.  They never really explain Caine's relationship with Parnell, though he regularly refers to him as ""like a dad"" throughout the film.  Also several of the other characters are hard to sympathise with as their background is never really explained (something I felt was done better in Boyz N The Hood),and I find it hard to believe Parnell would be cool with Caine's relationship with his girl.  Despite these minor faults the film is still great though and the ending in particular was tragic and inevitable.  One of the better hood movies of the early 90's, if your into them you should definetely check this out.",4,Powerful but not without it's faults,1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,1755,"['Menace', 'II', 'Society', 'was', 'debut', 'film', 'directing', 'duo', 'Hughes', 'brothers', 'released', '1993', 'height', 'popularity', 'hood', 'movies', 'most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'film', 'extemely', 'powerful', 'look', 'growing', 'up', 'L.A', 'early', '90', 'movie', 'grabs', 'attention', 'straight', 'away', 'robbery', 'liquor', 'store', 'controversial', 'shooting', 'Korean', 'owners', 'pace', 'never', 'up', 'Caine', 'Tyrin', 'Turner', 'basically', 'bystander', 'opening', 'scene', 'O-Dog', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'rampage', 'film', 'Caine', 'good', 'person', 'very', 'much', 'victim', 'circumstances', 'O-Dog', 'just', ""n't"", 'give', 'f**k', '.Without', 'going', 'plot', 'details', 'events', 'film', 'conspire', 'Caine', 'up', 'inevitable', 'ending', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'performances', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'MC', 'Eiht', 'small', 'role', 'start', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'Caine', 'father', 'film', 'very', 'powerful', 'sad', 'realistic', 'take', 'ghetto', 'life', 'not', 'faults', 'main', 'one', 'being', 'lack', 'depth', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'explain', 'Caine', 'relationship', 'Parnell', 'regularly', 'refers', 'dad', 'film', 'Also', 'several', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'hard', 'sympathise', 'background', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'something', 'felt', 'was', 'done', 'better', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'Parnell', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'Caine', 'relationship', 'girl', 'minor', 'faults', 'film', 'still', 'great', 'ending', 'particular', 'was', 'tragic', 'inevitable', 'One', 'better', 'hood', 'movies', 'early', '90', 'should', 'definetely', 'check', 'out']",Menace II Society

Menace II Society is set in the Watts district of South Central LA but it may as well be set in any poor inner city in the US. The film's protagonist is Caine, an 18 year old black kid who has just graduated from high school. His summer vacation gets off to a rough start as he goes to buy a beer with his pal O-Dog and ends up being an accessory to murder after O-Dog kills and robs the Korean merchant. ""Menace"" plays almost like a video. It begins with a random act of unnecessary violence and it ends with a random act of unnecessary violence. In between we get an amazing film that gives us a look into the world of the young poor black men growing up in the inner city and all the obstacles they face both real and percieved. Tyrin TUrner as Caine is a fantastic actor, who gives a very realistic portrayl. IN some parts the film almost looks like a documentary its so realistic! Larenz Tate as O-Dog is incredible! He's ""America's nightmare, young, black and doesn't give a f**k"". The plot is basically just life in South Central LA during a summer. We follow Caine as he explains his upbringing. His father was a drug dealer and his mother a drug user. His father was murdered and his mother overdosed. As a result, Caine lives with his devoutly relgious grandparents who have no control over him. His one role model is in jail. His friends (""homies"") are all small-time criminals looking for their next score. Its a roller-coaster ride of drive-by shootings, car-jackings, and assorted crimes.

JACKSON (one of the greatest actors of our time), when he's at the table playing cards when the guy across from him gives Tat some attitude. The dialogue in the exchange is classic, amidst the smoke and dark haze. After Tat wastes him with several shots to the chest, he turns on another man seated and shouts ""YOU OWE ME SOME MONEY, MOTHERF_____R??"".
