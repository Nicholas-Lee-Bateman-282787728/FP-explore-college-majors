875843,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B0006Z2NKE,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[18, 19]","Mango Yellow provides a look into the lower class life in Brazil in the city of Recife. There is a surreal atmosphere to the film because the characters are eccentric and exaggerated to emphasize certain aspects of their behavior and personalities. It is a film which allows raw expressions of feeling by those who are on the economic edge of life. The viewer is first introduced to a waitress who may also be the bar owner.. She is tired of her job and the lifestyle she leads but continues on ... providing philosophical treatistes while she serves her customers their favorite beverage. Her bar is the local hang out for many people. She fights off the sexual advances of her customers while also testing her sexuality and appeal ... They come to her rescue when she is challenged by a new customer, not one of her regulars.The viewer is introduced to several residents and employees at the Texas Hotel which is a seedy run down place, the only home to several unique characters. Isaac, also called ""the German"" has a peculiar fetish and obsession. It is very bizarre ... There is a lonely, elderly retired asthmatic woman named Aurora, who recalls her life during more exciting times. There is a gay cook named Dunga, who has the 'hots"" for a  heterosexual butcher named Wellington whom he knows he can not ""have""... Wellington is shown doing his work at the local slaughterhouse where a cow is killed and butchered, all of which is graphcally shown. The gay cook knows Wellington is cheating on his wife Kika. Wellington is very proud that his wife is a very religious Evangelical Christian. She reveals during a discussion at dinner that although she can forgive just about anything, the thing she absolutely can not tolerate is infidelity. Dunga wants to create trouble in Wellington's marriage when he realizes he will never have a relationship the way he would like with Wellington. The cook sends an anonymous note to Kika, telling her about a rendevous between her husband and his lover, he provides the time and the location.It is at this point in the film when everything heats up and comes to a climax, literally and figurately. The owner of the Texas Hotel is discovered dead, likely of natural causes. Dunga is the only one who cares enough to find the priest and try to provide him a decent funeral and burial. Wellington is caught by his wife ... cheating with his lover. Kika engages in a most shocking un-Christian action. After this event, she walks home but is offered a ride by Isaac who happens to be driving by. The two of them engage in some very needy sexual behavior. The film concludes with the camera recording different people who live in the neighborhood going about their lives in their usual manner ... with some unsual musical accompaniment. This film records the desperate lives of people who live on the edge of survival and who have very little hope. It provides a glimpse into the bleak existence of many  well fleshed out characters whose lives are very twisted and troubled ...This film will not appeal to everyone but viewers who like a strong film which makes a bold statement about life within a narrow part of the globe will appreciate this creative impression on celluloid left by the Brazilian director Claudio Assis.

875844,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0006Z2NKE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","2002's ""Mango Yellow"" represents one day in the lives of a diverse group of interconnected characters. It's fair to say that no one is particularly likable, and that might limit your emotional connection to the movie--but the actors are good and the various plot threads are well integrated. At the end of the day, there isn't a big message of import. The film is content to just showcase one day much like any other. There is drama, comedy, death, adultery, seduction, and a alluring wildness to the proceedings. The film kept me fitfully entertained even if it doesn't amount to a whole lot. Ultimately, though, that's kind of the point.
