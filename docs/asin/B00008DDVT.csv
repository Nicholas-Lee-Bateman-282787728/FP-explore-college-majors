739112,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00008DDVT,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Touching and moving, in the expected ways of most formulaic manipulative films of this nature, `Evelyn' will ignite the waterworks but in a remarkably subdued way.  There is something subtle about a film that uses all the tricks available to illicit a desired response from the audience.  Some may assume the film would be schmaltzy or saccharine in its manipulation, but they'd be wrong.  There is a quietness about `Evelyn' that understands how to manipulate without being so overtly blunt about it all.  I often refer to Ron Howard as the King of Schmaltz, namely because he knows how to massage his material in a way that goes down smooth, as opposed to the audience choking on large clumps of syrup.  Maybe something similar should be said of Bruce Beresford (who also directed `Driving Miss Daisy').This Irish tale centers on a father, Desmond Doyle, who is ravaged by his wife's decision to abandon their family; the day after Christmas, no less.  Desmond and his wife had three small children, and so now Desmond is left on his own to raise them.  However, the Irish law protests that the children actually be taken from his custody and placed in Catholic orphanages, and Desmond's frequent flock to the local pubs isn't helping his case.  Still, with the help of a barmaid determined to help him kick his addiction, and two lawyers who want to use his case to make a difference, Desmond proceeds with battling for his right to raise his own children.The acting on all fronts is great, especially from Pierce Brosnan.  Brosnan is such an underrated actor.  He really deserves stronger material, because he can handle it and handle it well at that.  He emotes so effortlessly, finding subtle ways to devastate the audience with his authentic portrayal of a father lost in his resolve to find a sense of normalcy.  Julianna Margulies, Stephen Rea, Aidan Quinn and Sophie Vavasseur are all also very effective here.Together, the cast, director and technical team (the film is beautifully shot as well) help create something very moving and wholly `felt'.",4,Surprisingly warm and moving...,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",2011,2059,"['Touching', 'moving', 'expected', 'ways', 'most', 'formulaic', 'manipulative', 'films', 'nature', 'Evelyn', 'will', 'ignite', 'waterworks', 'remarkably', 'subdued', 'way', 'something', 'subtle', 'film', 'tricks', 'available', 'illicit', 'desired', 'response', 'audience', 'may', 'assume', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'schmaltzy', 'saccharine', 'manipulation', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'quietness', 'Evelyn', 'how', 'manipulate', 'being', 'so', 'overtly', 'blunt', 'often', 'refer', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'King', 'Schmaltz', 'namely', 'how', 'massage', 'material', 'way', 'down', 'smooth', 'opposed', 'audience', 'choking', 'large', 'clumps', 'syrup', 'Maybe', 'something', 'similar', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', '.This', 'Irish', 'tale', 'centers', 'father', 'Desmond', 'Doyle', 'who', 'ravaged', 'wife', 'decision', 'abandon', 'family', 'day', 'Christmas', 'less', 'Desmond', 'wife', 'had', 'three', 'small', 'children', 'so', 'now', 'Desmond', 'left', 'own', 'raise', 'However', 'Irish', 'law', 'protests', 'children', 'actually', 'be', 'taken', 'custody', 'placed', 'Catholic', 'orphanages', 'Desmond', 'frequent', 'flock', 'local', 'pubs', ""n't"", 'helping', 'case', 'Still', 'help', 'barmaid', 'determined', 'help', 'kick', 'addiction', 'two', 'lawyers', 'who', 'want', 'use', 'case', 'make', 'difference', 'Desmond', 'proceeds', 'battling', 'right', 'raise', 'own', 'children.The', 'acting', 'fronts', 'great', 'especially', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Brosnan', 'such', 'underrated', 'actor', 'really', 'stronger', 'material', 'can', 'handle', 'handle', 'well', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'finding', 'subtle', 'ways', 'devastate', 'audience', 'authentic', 'portrayal', 'father', 'lost', 'resolve', 'find', 'sense', 'normalcy', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Sophie', 'Vavasseur', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'effective', 'here.Together', 'cast', 'director', 'technical', 'team', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'as', 'well', 'help', 'create', 'something', 'very', 'moving', 'wholly', 'felt']",Evelyn

At least it goes after the right things: a father having custody of his kids, rather than them being forced to live in an ""institution.""The story is based a true situation in the mid 1950s Ireland in which, in the end, the Irish Constitution was amended because of this case. ""Desmond Doyle"" (Pierce Brosnan) is the loving father whose wife runs off one day with another man, leaving him with three little kids and little visible means of support. Since he didn't have enough finances, the government makes the kids wards of the state and places them in Catholic schools-homes (institutions?).On that Catholic, or ""religious,"" angle, you get a lot of positive and negative scenes here. You have a bad, nasty almost sadistic nun ""Sister Brigid,"" but the others are fine caring ladies, as they should be. Overall, however, you see a lot of faith portrayed in this film and it's mostly inspiring.Brosnan is excellent in the lead role, a man everyone can identify with: a loving-but-flawed man. He drinks too much, he swears, he doesn't have a steady job but he has great heart and has great determination to do the right thing. One has no trouble rooting for him in this story. I think it's the best role he has ever played, far better than his superficial James Bond roles.But nobody hits you as emotionally as little Evelyn (Sophie Vavasseur), one of Doyle's three kids and the one that is focused upon here. (The two little brothers are not given much screen time, for some reason.)Brosnan's allies in here - the two lawyers (played by Stephen Rea and Aiden Quinn) are likable as is Alan Bates who plays a rugged ex-barrister who winds up helping the team. Bates might have had the best role for the supporting actors.This is such an involving story, one that you really care about the people, it can bring a tear or two in the end, but what's wrong with that?

With the aid of two lawyers (Stephen Rea & Aidan Quinn) as well as a barmaid (Julianna Margulies) who not only gives Desmond her heart but the will to remain sober, Desmond fights the system in order to regain the custody he should have never lost.With brilliant performances by the entire cast, especially young Sophie Vavasseur who plays Evelyn, Desmond's daughter, `Evelyn' should reside in everyone's heart and remain in our thoughts long after the credits have finished rolling.

739120,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00008DDVT,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[5, 5]","I never gave this movie much of a chance when it was released to little fanfare or publicity in 2002. The Pierce Brosnan movie that was receiving most of the attention that year was the James Bond blockbuster DIE ANOTHER DAY. And this rather quiet, low budget affair seemed to be about as far away from the 007 globe-trotting extravaganza as a movie could be, and so it slipped away barely noticed.It was therefore with a certain level of curiosity that I programmed my TiVo to record this movie when it appeared on U.S. cable television recently. Brosnan was no longer the reigning 007 after the producers of that series decided (understandably) that a younger actor was needed  when bringing the initial Fleming novel to the screen and the Irish actor was trying valiantly to make a name for himself in smaller productions such as THE MATADOR.The movie EVELYN, under the banner of Brosnan's production company Irish Dreamtime and released by 007 company MGM (as part of a deal they had with the actor), tells the true story of Desmond Doyle, an Irish father who attempts to regain custody of his three children.  The three have been taken under the protection of the Irish state following the family's abandonment by the mother and  Doyle's legal team challenge the entire Irish system of family law, claiming it to be unconstitutional.Brosnan delivers perhaps his best performance in what must have been a very personal project for him (the actor was raised by his mother after his father abandoned  them, and Brosnan had to raise his children by himself after his wife Cassandra Harris died from ovarian cancer).  Brosnan convincingly portrays a range of emotions from jealousy (at seeing his wife flirtatious at the pub) to anger (at a nun who struck his daughter) and frustration (at the bureaucracy and politics of the legal system).I do not pretend to know anything about the Irish legal system. But I was able to follow the various steps being followed by Doyle's legal counsel (top marks to the passionate portrayal of his barrister Nick Barron by the always excellent Aidan Quinn), which should be a testament to the wonderful script by Paul Pender and the measured  direction by Bruce Beresford.The final courtroom scenes are riveting and you feel the same anguish as the retired lawyer, aiding Doyle Tom Connolly (played in a scene stealing performance by Alan Bates) as he tries to follow and interpret the twists and turns of the final judgement through all its' ""However""'s. The performance by Sophie Vavasseur as the precocious Evelyn is a real treat and remarkable in its depth for such a young performer. Her performance on the witness stand is classic. Upon hearing the testimony of one of the nuns she exclaims, ""Oh, no, that's not true! Hope she goes to confession soon.""This movie is a real treat and it equally heart warming and heart wrenching.

Greene ""davidgreene52movie devotee""","[1, 1]","I read several comments expressing surprise that this film did not make any kind of splash in the theaters.  This hardly surprises me.  For so long now, the industry has been single-mindedly focused on promoting movies that, in one way or another, have a larger-than-life quality to them.  They pitch non-stop action, suspense, immense grandeur, all star casts, sweeping, epic sagas, etc.....  ""Evelyn"" is none of these.  It does not have a dozen wild plot twists.  There are no astounding special effects.  The cast is not bloated with superstars.  Instead, this is a fairly simple little story.  It could be called sentimental, but it is not one of those sticky-sweet shows that transparently tries to work a tired tear-jerker formula on the audience.  It tells a true story, simply and tenderly.  The cast does a wonderful job without over-doing it.  The scenes touching on the perspectives of the children unfold with a captivating sensitivity to the way most children actually perceive their world.  We are shown their sometimes magical view of things without drifting into obviously cinematic fantasy sequences.  Simple rays of sunlight on a little girl's fingers can momentarily prove as touching and enchanting as many a familiar excursion into computer generated wonderlands.For those seeking adrenaline rushes, jaw-dropping visual extravaganzas, etc., etc....... you might as well look elsewhere.  ""Evelyn"" is a very moving, stirring little film, but probably only for those who are willing to settle into its gentle, intimate little reality.  Of course, part of the fun in experiencing this true story lies in the discovery of how the struggles of its characters ultimately brought about major legal and social change in Ireland where it all takes place.

After his wife walks out on the family on St. Stephen's Day, Desmond struggles to provide for himself and three young children - only to lose custody of them to the state a few weeks later. Heartbroken by the loss of his kids, Desmond sinks into despair - and the bottle - until a young barmaid, Bernadette Beattie (Julianna Margulies) convinces him to hire a lawyer to win his children back and become a better man in the process.Desmond enlists the help of Bernadette's brother, cynical solicitor Michael Beattie (Stephen Rea), who manages to add a dash of realism to Desmond's dreams for a happy ending. Doyle's heartfelt plea for assistance allows Michael's friend, American lawyer Nick Barron (Aidan Quinn), to take on the case as well. Barron, unlike Beattie, knows what Desmond is going through; he recently lost custody of his own children in a divorce case. The two convince retired law professor and rugby player Tom Connolly (Alan Bates), a charasmatic yet eccentric rogue, to assist their case against the Irish courts. Together, the group dares to do what no one has done before - successfully challenge a law against the Irish Constitution.While the film is inevitably about the storyline, which, at times, can be intense, it is the characters who make the movie as special as it is. Bates and Quinn are cheerful and comedic in their roles, and Rea and Margulies add realism to Brosnan's dreaming. However, it is young Sophie Vavasseur, who plays Desmond's daughter Evelyn, who steals the show. Her striking maturity mixed with childhood innocence, are what make the movie incredibly heartwarming.I waited six months for the chance to see this movie, but it was absolutely incredible.

Only THE TAILOR OF PANAMA and the 1999 remake of THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR come to mind, and, in the former, Brosnan played a 007-type gone to seed.In EVELYN, Brosnan is Desmond Doyle, an alcoholic, chronically unemployed Irish carpenter whose wife splits to Australia with another man, probably an Englishman, leaving Doyle with three young children - two boys and a girl. Deeming Desmond an unfit father, the court orders the children into church institutions providing foster care for orphans and the children of broken homes. The film, ostensibly based on a true story, has Doyle going up against the Irish government and the Catholic Church to regain custody of his kids. Set in the early 1950s, this is thought an impossible task.The best part of EVELYN is seeing Brosnan not typecast in a role consistent with the other films previously mentioned. Pierce even sings - and quite passably too. Of the three children, the script focuses on daughter EVELYN (Sophie Vasseur), the apple of her father's eye. The boys are just extra props. Doyle is aided in his tilt against the windmill by his father and a trio of legal eagles, all out of Central Casting. And then there's the cruel nun, Sister Brigid (Andrea Irvine), emergent from the nightmares of parochial school kids everywhere.EVELYN is enjoyable enough, but oh so predictable. I mean, underdog Dad takes on two insensitive megalithic bureaucracies to rescue his absolutely adorable little girl AND win the love of a Good Woman (as opposed to his runaway wife, the Bad Woman). Is there anybody in the universe so obtuse that he couldn't predict the outcome of that match-up? The fact that the story is &quot;based on&quot; actual events leaves one wondering how much Hollywood simplified the tale to maximize the hankie factor.

Pender wrote a script on spec for Pierce Brosnan who signed on.  So did first choice director Bruce Beresford and cast members Stephen Rae, Julianna Margulies, Aidan Quinn, and Alan Bates.  It seems nobody turned down Evelyn, including the Supreme Court of Ireland, which is where the climax of this true tale takes place.Brosnan plays Desmond Doyle, an unemployed tradesman in the early 1950s who is on the dole and taken to drink.  When his wife (Mairead Devlin) runs off to Australia with another man, Desmond is left with their three children, Evelyn (the glowing Sophie Vavassuer), Dermot (Niall Beagan), and Maurice (Hugh McDonagh).  His mother-in-law rats him out to the authorities, who first send in the nuns to clean up the Doyle household, and then use the courts to send the children to Catholic orphanages.  It seems the law of Ireland said that it was illegal for a father to try and raise his children by himself.  Desmond is advised by a judge to get his life together to get his children back, but it turns out this cannot happen without the permission of both parents and since his wife has gone away with no intention of ever coming back, Desmond is caught in a catch-22.Supported by his wise father, Henry (Frank Kelly), Desmond is referred by a kindly bar maid, Bernadette Beattie (Marguiles) to her brother Michael (Rae), a solicitor.  When they need a barrister they find one in Nick Barron (Quinn), an Irish-American, who in turn gets them to get the counsel of Thomas Connolly (Bates), a legendary rugby player and legal gadfly.  Together they have to do something that has never been done before, namely get the Irish court system to change the law of the land.  Of course we know how this is going to come out, otherwise the real Evelyn would have been selling a story of tragedy rather than of triumph, but how ordinary people go around winning the unwinnable court case (what Connolly calls a &quot;St. Jude&quot; case) is usually interesting.What is interesting about &quot;Evelyn,&quot; especially for anyone who has seen &quot;The Magdalene Sisters&quot; and has the horror of the Catholic laundry-houses in their mind as they worry about young Evelyn Doyle, is that the villain here is the Irish court system and not the Catholic Church.  True, you will find yourself cheering Desmond when he actually lays hands on a nun, but Sister Brigid (Andrea Irvine) is clearly the exception and not the rule at the convent where Evelyn has been sent.  Sister Felicity (Karen Ardiff) is a saint it is more the situation than the site that makes the convent a sad place.  The Minister of Education (Mark Lambert) is at least willing to allow that the law might have some imperfections, and even if Justice Ferris (Connor Evans) is an insult to a particular type of rodent, the Irish Supreme Court has three judges on it.Brosnan provides a solid performance and his finest moment comes in court when he is on the stand.  The barrister for the Ministry of Education points out to Desmond that the religion he supposedly believes in is based on the family ideal of the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  The barrister demands to know where in the Bible or the Catholic religion is there anything to support the idea of a man raising his children alone without a mother.  Desmond struggles to find a reply, but it is a really good reply.  Likewise, young Evelyn is put on the witness stand and makes mincemeat of the barrister as well.  &quot;Evelyn&quot; is not a great film, but it is solid and clearly everyone who participated in making it is has a reason to be proud of their efforts.",4,An Irish father fights the courts to raise his own children,1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,3766,"['Writer', 'Paul', 'Pender', 'was', 'approached', 'real', 'Evelyn', 'who', 'thought', 'somebody', 'should', 'tell', 'story', 'father', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'did', 'Pender', 'wrote', 'script', 'spec', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'who', 'signed', 'So', 'did', 'first', 'choice', 'director', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'cast', 'members', 'Stephen', 'Rae', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'nobody', 'turned', 'down', 'Evelyn', 'including', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Ireland', 'where', 'climax', 'true', 'tale', 'place.Brosnan', 'plays', 'Desmond', 'Doyle', 'unemployed', 'tradesman', 'early', '1950s', 'who', 'dole', 'taken', 'drink', 'When', 'wife', 'Mairead', 'Devlin', 'Australia', 'man', 'Desmond', 'left', 'three', 'children', 'Evelyn', 'glowing', 'Sophie', 'Vavassuer', 'Dermot', 'Niall', 'Beagan', 'Maurice', 'Hugh', 'McDonagh', 'mother-in-law', 'rats', 'authorities', 'who', 'first', 'send', 'nuns', 'clean', 'up', 'Doyle', 'household', 'then', 'use', 'courts', 'send', 'children', 'Catholic', 'orphanages', 'law', 'Ireland', 'said', 'was', 'illegal', 'father', 'try', 'raise', 'children', 'Desmond', 'advised', 'judge', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'get', 'children', 'back', 'out', 'can', 'not', 'happen', 'permission', 'parents', 'wife', 'gone', 'away', 'intention', 'ever', 'coming', 'back', 'Desmond', 'caught', 'catch-22.Supported', 'wise', 'father', 'Henry', 'Frank', 'Kelly', 'Desmond', 'referred', 'kindly', 'bar', 'maid', 'Bernadette', 'Beattie', 'Marguiles', 'brother', 'Michael', 'Rae', 'solicitor', 'When', 'need', 'barrister', 'find', 'one', 'Nick', 'Barron', 'Quinn', 'Irish-American', 'who', 'turn', 'get', 'counsel', 'Thomas', 'Connolly', 'Bates', 'legendary', 'rugby', 'player', 'legal', 'gadfly', 'Together', 'have', 'do', 'something', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'namely', 'get', 'Irish', 'court', 'system', 'change', 'law', 'land', 'course', 'know', 'how', 'going', 'come', 'out', 'otherwise', 'real', 'Evelyn', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'selling', 'story', 'tragedy', 'rather', 'triumph', 'how', 'ordinary', 'people', 'go', 'winning', 'unwinnable', 'court', 'case', 'what', 'Connolly', 'quot', 'St.', 'Jude', 'quot', 'case', 'usually', 'interesting.What', 'interesting', 'quot', 'Evelyn', 'quot', 'especially', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'quot', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'quot', 'horror', 'Catholic', 'laundry-houses', 'mind', 'worry', 'young', 'Evelyn', 'Doyle', 'villain', 'here', 'Irish', 'court', 'system', 'not', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'True', 'will', 'find', 'cheering', 'Desmond', 'when', 'actually', 'hands', 'nun', 'Sister', 'Brigid', 'Andrea', 'Irvine', 'clearly', 'exception', 'not', 'rule', 'convent', 'where', 'Evelyn', 'been', 'sent', 'Sister', 'Felicity', 'Karen', 'Ardiff', 'saint', 'more', 'situation', 'site', 'convent', 'sad', 'place', 'Minister', 'Education', 'Mark', 'Lambert', 'least', 'willing', 'allow', 'law', 'might', 'have', 'imperfections', 'even', 'Justice', 'Ferris', 'Connor', 'Evans', 'insult', 'particular', 'type', 'rodent', 'Irish', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'three', 'judges', 'it.Brosnan', 'solid', 'performance', 'finest', 'moment', 'court', 'when', 'stand', 'barrister', 'Ministry', 'Education', 'points', 'out', 'Desmond', 'religion', 'supposedly', 'based', 'family', 'ideal', 'Holy', 'Family', 'Jesus', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'barrister', 'know', 'where', 'Bible', 'Catholic', 'religion', 'there', 'anything', 'support', 'idea', 'man', 'raising', 'children', 'alone', 'mother', 'Desmond', 'find', 'reply', 'really', 'good', 'reply', 'Likewise', 'young', 'Evelyn', 'put', 'witness', 'stand', 'mincemeat', 'barrister', 'as', 'well', 'quot', 'Evelyn', 'quot', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'solid', 'clearly', 'everyone', 'who', 'participated', 'making', 'reason', 'be', 'proud', 'efforts']",Evelyn

Australian Director Bruce Beresford who was nominated for a Best Director Oscar for &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; and has also done &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; and &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; does a marvelous job with the small independent feature.  From the informative featurette on the DVD, he was instrumental in pruning screenwriter Paul Pender's screenplay and insisting on Pierce Brosnan's final courtroom speech.This film is one that touches your heartstrings.  The theme of love a parent has for their children is universal and allows this to be a movie that is important to us.  With the Irish setting and plot that centers on the Irish judicial system, it seems like heartstrings &amp; clover.Pierce Brosnan was the moving force behind putting the picture together; and it is an admirable project.  Brosnan turns in one of his best performances as the father who fights to get his children back.  His voice cracks with emotion as he tells how much he loves them and that he wants to bring them up surrounded by love.  It's not corny or overly sentimental; it's what makes the world go round!Sophie Vavasseur is wonderful as the title character Evelyn.  She has the pureness and faith of a child's heart and nails the sweetness of the character.  The scene where she watches her mother run off with another man is heartbreaking as the audience understands more than the child who watches with puzzlement.  If there were more to wish for, additional time for the two boys to show their father's connection to them would have focused on the whole family.ER's Julianna Margulies does a nice job as the supportive Bernadette who tends bar.  She refers Brosnan's Desmond Doyle character to her brother lawyer Michael Beattie played by Stephen Rea.  Rea's subdued solicitor character leads Doyle to yet another lawyer, barrister Nick Barron played by Aidan Quinn.  They get Thomas Connolly on the team played by Alan Bates, recently from &quot;Gosford Park&quot; and &quot;The Mothman Prophecy.&quot;  Bates passed away from cancer in December 2003, but is full of feisty spirit as he shepherds the case to Irish Supreme Court.  As Charlotte Doyle, Mairead Devlin gives a brief but memorable performance as the restless wife.&quot;Evelyn&quot; was a small film, but it works wonderfully.  It tugs at the heartstrings and is a great family film to help us recall how much our families mean in our lives.  The shooting on the film started shortly after 9/11 and seems to draw inspiration from the time in which it was shot.  The fact that this is based on a true story makes it poignant.

In EVELYN, director Bruce Beresford manages to take what might have been an overly saccharine tale of the Triumph of the Underdog and manages to tell it in such a way that we don't care that we are being shamelessly manipulated so seamlessly does he involve the viewer in how a father regains custody of his children taken from him by a heartless state.Pierce Brosnan is Desmond Doyle, a man who likes his strong Irish drink and struggles to keep a marriage afloat despite his ongoing inability to keep a job and a wife who shows that she is one step away from walking out with a boyfriend.  When she leaves, she barely glimpses at her daughter Evelyn (Sophie Vavasseur) before taking off.  Things go from bad to worse for Desmond.  He drinks more than ever and a harridan of a mother-in-law informs the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children that Desmond's three children are being neglected.  A local magistrate places them in a church orphanage.  The two sons are, in the film, seen only in passing, and it is only Evelyn's plight that we see.  For those who remember how nuns enforced discipline with rulers whacked on knuckles, the scenes where a sadistic sister beats Evelyn resonate strongly.  Desmond seeks help, first with the advice of a local barmaid, Julianne Marguilies, then with Stephen Rea and Aidan Quinn, who agree to help in a case that seems like a sure loser.EVELYN is a feel-good film that does not try to gloss over that in this case at least, a happy ending is predictably foreshadowed every time Desmond's lawyers remind him that he has no chance to win.  To make this kind of David and Goliath film work, the audience has to know and care about the characters.  Brosnan, Vavasseur, Rea, Quinn, and Marguilies all bounce off each other in ways that make us laugh and cry on cue.  The best films do this too and in ways that continually remind us that laughing and crying are part of the basic human condition.

Other reviews have done a good job of encapsulating the plot, so I'll say that what impressed me most was the film's ability to capture a time and a mood. The script is excellent and the acting is good, but what continues to stun me is that this is a true story that happened less than fifty years ago in a supposedly civilized country. One reviewer wrote that the movie's outcome was inevitable--heroic father fights to take back his kids and wins in the face of overwhelming odds.

If you are reading my review, rent, watch, or better, buy it, as it will be an enduring favorite of yours, I guarantee it.I watched this movie because it was recommended to me as a clean, family values-type movie.  That is like calling the Taj Mahal a ""big house"".  This movie has everything a movie can have, including a universal appeal, even to those who shun typical ""family values"" movies.  It is a masterpiece.It  stars Pierce Brosnan, an actor I normally do not enjoy, and whom I've sterotyped as playing shallow roles.  In ""Evelyn"" he is marvelous, incredible, a great actor.  ""Evelyn"" is based on the true story of Desmond Doyle, a father who loses custody of his three children in 1950's Ireland, when his wife abandons both him and her children.  At that time, fathers had limited rights when up against the Catholic Church and the Irish government.  The film centers around the struggle of one man to be reunited with his children.However, there is so much more to the movie than just Desmond Doyle's legal struggles.  There are his personal challenges, which are many.  Ther is the acting of Aidan quinn, Julianna Marguilies, alan Bates, and the children---all so talented, entertaining, exciting.  There is the relationship between Evelyn and her beloved grandfather.  There is the Irish spirit.  This is a film about faith, forgiveness, human failings, and how sometimes so many things can go wrong while everyone is truly trying to do the right thing.It is of special mention that, unlike other films of this genre, no one was ""demonized"" or portrayed a ""villan"".  It woudl have been temptin to have done this to either the Catholic Church, the Irish justice system, the legal profession, etc.---but instead institutions and professions were portrayed realistically and accurately---in that htye are composed of complex people of various types, all tryin to do the best they can.Unlike other films with a PG rating---which spells ""BORING"" normally in my view (sorry)---this film is riveting, poignant, inspirational, uplifting, and complicated.  How many PG movies are there tha you could discuss for hours with freinds at the coffee shop or pub?  This is one of those movies.It is my new favorite movie. Grandma and Grandpa will love it and it wil rmeind them of the great films of their day. Teens will love it, too, and maybe wonder why, since it's probably unlike any other movie the've seen before.  Intelligent film goers will have discussions about it.  Little children will enjoy it on a different level.  It's not a chick flick, either.  And even though there are no car chases or sex scenes or typeical violence, men will love it because it's about a man being a real man, something that will appeal to any male, no matter what his character, values, lifestyle, or usual movie preferences.This movie is about what we are all looking for in life, and what Desmond Doyle found.*****",5,"Family Values, Enduring Values",1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,2946,"['*****Why', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'movie', 'are', 'reading', 'review', 'rent', 'watch', 'better', 'buy', 'will', 'be', 'enduring', 'favorite', 'yours', 'guarantee', 'it.I', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'recommended', 'clean', 'family', 'values-type', 'movie', 'calling', 'Taj', 'Mahal', 'big', 'house', 'movie', 'everything', 'movie', 'can', 'have', 'including', 'universal', 'appeal', 'even', 'who', 'shun', 'typical', 'family', 'values', 'movies', 'masterpiece.It', 'stars', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'actor', 'normally', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'sterotyped', 'playing', 'shallow', 'roles', 'Evelyn', 'marvelous', 'incredible', 'great', 'actor', 'Evelyn', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Desmond', 'Doyle', 'father', 'who', 'custody', 'three', 'children', '1950', 'Ireland', 'when', 'wife', 'abandons', 'children', 'time', 'fathers', 'had', 'limited', 'rights', 'when', 'up', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Irish', 'government', 'film', 'centers', 'struggle', 'one', 'man', 'be', 'reunited', 'children.However', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'just', 'Desmond', 'Doyle', 'legal', 'struggles', 'are', 'personal', 'challenges', 'are', 'many', 'acting', 'Aidan', 'quinn', 'Julianna', 'Marguilies', 'alan', 'Bates', 'children', 'so', 'talented', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'relationship', 'Evelyn', 'beloved', 'grandfather', 'Irish', 'spirit', 'film', 'faith', 'forgiveness', 'human', 'failings', 'how', 'sometimes', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'everyone', 'truly', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing.It', 'special', 'mention', 'other', 'films', 'genre', 'one', 'was', 'demonized', 'portrayed', 'villan', 'have', 'been', 'temptin', 'have', 'done', 'either', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Irish', 'justice', 'system', 'legal', 'profession', 'etc.', '-but', 'instead', 'institutions', 'professions', 'were', 'portrayed', 'realistically', 'accurately', '-in', 'htye', 'are', 'composed', 'complex', 'people', 'various', 'types', 'tryin', 'do', 'best', 'can.Unlike', 'other', 'films', 'PG', 'rating', '-which', 'spells', 'BORING', 'normally', 'view', 'sorry', '-this', 'film', 'riveting', 'poignant', 'inspirational', 'uplifting', 'complicated', 'How', 'many', 'PG', 'movies', 'are', 'there', 'could', 'discuss', 'hours', 'freinds', 'coffee', 'shop', 'pub', 'one', 'movies.It', 'new', 'favorite', 'movie', 'Grandma', 'Grandpa', 'will', 'love', 'wil', 'rmeind', 'great', 'films', 'day', 'Teens', 'will', 'love', 'too', 'maybe', 'wonder', 'why', 'probably', 'other', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Intelligent', 'film', 'goers', 'will', 'have', 'discussions', 'Little', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'different', 'level', 'not', 'chick', 'flick', 'even', 'are', 'car', 'sex', 'scenes', 'typeical', 'violence', 'men', 'will', 'love', 'man', 'being', 'real', 'man', 'something', 'will', 'appeal', 'male', 'matter', 'what', 'character', 'values', 'lifestyle', 'usual', 'movie', 'preferences.This', 'movie', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'life', 'what', 'Desmond', 'Doyle', 'found', '*****']",Evelyn

739161,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00008DDVT,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 6]","""Evelyn"" is a decent enough little picture that gives Pierce Brosnan a chance to shed his slick James Bond persona and stretch a bit as an actor.  Here he portrays Desmond Doyle, an unemployed working class stiff living in Ireland in the mid-1950's.  When his wife suddenly runs off to Australia with another man, Doyle is confronted with having to raise his three young children on his own.  Because he is out of work, the Irish government steps in and decides to send the children to orphanages.  It is Doyle's fight to regain custody of his children that ultimately leads to a celebrated Supreme Court case and the eventually overturning of Ireland's archaic laws in this area.""Evelyn"" is more interesting for the glimpse it affords us into this obscure piece of Irish history than it is for the human drama at the film's core.  The screenplay by Paul Pender, though it does an adequate task of dramatizing the situation, often feels incomplete and underdeveloped at the story's deepest levels.  For while the film resists the temptation to lay on the sentimentality too thickly, it often feels too dry and detached to make us ever really care much about the characters on screen.  We know that Doyle loves his children and they love him, but we never seem to go much beneath that surface level in our understanding of any of the characters.  It doesn't help that the director, Bruce Beresford, often goes in for obvious corny imagery such as young Evelyn's belief that slanting sun rays actually represent the presence of guardian angels - a concept that is replayed at various convenient moments in the story for purposes of intended emotional uplift.  In doesn't work because it reeks of phoniness at a time when hard-edged reality is what is really called for.  Indeed, somehow, despite the fact that we know this is all based on a true story, much of what we see here does not always have the ring of authenticity about it.  Perhaps, given the grimness of the subject matter, the film is a bit too light and airy in tone, a bit too eager to please and to make us feel good about life. Doyle's relationship with a woman who works in a local pub is also underdeveloped, and the supposed rivalry between Doyle and his lawyer for her attentions is so badly handled that one wonders why the filmmakers even bothered to include it at all.The film is generally well acted, with Sophie Vavasseur stealing the spotlight as little Evelyn.  This first rate child actress is utterly poised, winsome and captivating in her portrayal of a warmhearted, clearheaded little girl.  Her performance, in fact, makes the carpers among us feel a little bit like curmudgeons.  Alan Bates does an impressive job playing a broken down, alcoholic ex-attorney who rallies to the cause of this giant-slaying David, a stereotype admittedly, but one which Bates invests with a sly charm and devil-may-care crustiness.  Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea and Julianna Margules do their best with less well-developed roles.  Brossan gets points for at least trying to stretch his acting muscles a bit, but somehow he never really plumbs the emotional and psychological depths inherent in the character he is portraying.  This might be as much the fault of the screenplay as of the actor, however.What does keep ""Evelyn"" interesting, despite all its flaws, is the sense of history it manages to give us, so that, even though it lacks the layering one usually associates with Beresford's best work, the film has enough going for it to recommend it.",3,not without interest but could have been better,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,3512,"['Evelyn', 'decent', 'enough', 'little', 'picture', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'chance', 'shed', 'slick', 'James', 'Bond', 'persona', 'stretch', 'bit', 'actor', 'Here', 'Desmond', 'Doyle', 'unemployed', 'working', 'class', 'stiff', 'living', 'Ireland', 'mid-1950', 'When', 'wife', 'suddenly', 'Australia', 'man', 'Doyle', 'confronted', 'having', 'raise', 'three', 'young', 'children', 'own', 'work', 'Irish', 'government', 'steps', 'decides', 'send', 'children', 'orphanages', 'Doyle', 'fight', 'regain', 'custody', 'children', 'ultimately', 'celebrated', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'case', 'eventually', 'overturning', 'Ireland', 'archaic', 'laws', 'area', 'Evelyn', 'more', 'interesting', 'glimpse', 'obscure', 'piece', 'Irish', 'history', 'human', 'drama', 'film', 'core', 'screenplay', 'Paul', 'Pender', 'adequate', 'task', 'dramatizing', 'situation', 'often', 'incomplete', 'underdeveloped', 'story', 'deepest', 'levels', 'film', 'temptation', 'lay', 'sentimentality', 'too', 'thickly', 'often', 'too', 'dry', 'detached', 'make', 'ever', 'really', 'care', 'much', 'characters', 'screen', 'know', 'Doyle', 'children', 'love', 'never', 'seem', 'go', 'much', 'beneath', 'surface', 'level', 'understanding', 'characters', ""n't"", 'help', 'director', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'often', 'obvious', 'corny', 'imagery', 'such', 'young', 'Evelyn', 'belief', 'slanting', 'sun', 'rays', 'actually', 'represent', 'presence', 'guardian', 'angels', 'concept', 'replayed', 'various', 'convenient', 'moments', 'story', 'purposes', 'intended', 'emotional', 'uplift', ""n't"", 'work', 'phoniness', 'time', 'when', 'hard-edged', 'reality', 'what', 'really', 'called', 'Indeed', 'somehow', 'fact', 'know', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'not', 'always', 'have', 'ring', 'authenticity', 'Perhaps', 'given', 'grimness', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'light', 'airy', 'tone', 'bit', 'too', 'eager', 'please', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'life', 'Doyle', 'relationship', 'woman', 'who', 'local', 'pub', 'also', 'underdeveloped', 'supposed', 'rivalry', 'Doyle', 'lawyer', 'attentions', 'so', 'badly', 'handled', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'filmmakers', 'even', 'bothered', 'include', 'all.The', 'film', 'generally', 'well', 'acted', 'Sophie', 'Vavasseur', 'stealing', 'spotlight', 'little', 'Evelyn', 'first', 'rate', 'child', 'actress', 'utterly', 'poised', 'winsome', 'captivating', 'portrayal', 'warmhearted', 'clearheaded', 'little', 'girl', 'performance', 'fact', 'carpers', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'curmudgeons', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'impressive', 'job', 'playing', 'broken', 'down', 'alcoholic', 'ex-attorney', 'who', 'cause', 'giant-slaying', 'David', 'stereotype', 'admittedly', 'one', 'invests', 'sly', 'charm', 'devil-may-care', 'crustiness', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Julianna', 'Margules', 'do', 'best', 'less', 'well-developed', 'roles', 'Brossan', 'points', 'least', 'trying', 'stretch', 'acting', 'muscles', 'bit', 'somehow', 'never', 'really', 'plumbs', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'depths', 'inherent', 'character', 'portraying', 'might', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'fault', 'screenplay', 'actor', 'however.What', 'keep', 'Evelyn', 'interesting', 'flaws', 'sense', 'history', 'give', 'even', 'layering', 'one', 'usually', 'Beresford', 'best', 'work', 'film', 'enough', 'going', 'recommend']",Evelyn

739164,A1F7CMDX6QDJVA,B00008DDVT,"shoutgrace ""savedbyhisgrace""","[4, 4]","Evelyn, based on the memoirs of Evelyn Doyle, 'Tea and Green Ribbons.' It has won admiration from Insight a TBN daily program that views films for Christian family viewing. It has also touched my heart as well. I've wondered why Hollywood hasn't given the rightful publicity to this film as it's due. It's time for Hollywood to realize what makes a good film. Evelyn's a moving tender story about an Irish father, Desmond Doyle (Pierce Bronsan) who must go against the Irish court system to get back his children that were taken away from him. The story set in 1953, begins as Desmond a Dublin working-class, father of three who's unemployed and has a penance for the pub. It's one day the wife leave the family on St. Stephen's Day (the day after Christmas) and goes to Australia with another man. Desmond by his own consequence and immature irresponsiblity faces the Irish law who order the removal of the children to an orphanage.Times are economically hard so Desmond goes to find work in London. When he comes back for his children the Irish authorities have taken the children to a Catholic orphanage run by cruel nuns. Evelyn (Sophie Vasseur in the title role) and her two sibling brothers suffer emotional and even physical abuse. Desmond seeks the help of two lawyers (Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea). They help to overturn a law that prevents a single parent from keeping custody of their children. The two lawyers seize the opportunity to bring about a radical change in the old laws. Desmond fights the good fight. And through all the battles, loses and hopes Desmond comes out the shining father. Sophie Vasseur does a marvelously top-rate performance of Evelyn Doyle. It brings a tear in your eye when you see Desmond hug Evelyn. I'll leave the verdict and the ending for you to see. I guarantee it will be one of the best movies you'll see in 2002.The soundtrack ASIN: B00006XPTG is also great.

739167,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,B00008DDVT,Themis-Athena,"[12, 12]","Ever since the constitutional reform of 1936, the Catholic Church and the Irish state have been inexorably linked; more so than in almost any other western society.  A substantial part of Irish legislation - particularly, Irish family law - was (and partly, still is) directly based on Catholic doctrine:  prohibiting divorce and abortion; and until 1953, prohibiting a single father from bringing up his children without the mother's consent, thus in essence committing every motherless child to church orphanages until age 16.  This changed only when the Irish Supreme Court declared the respective sections of the Children's Act unconstitutional - a landmark decision because for the first time the ties between church and state were broken, and for the first time an Irish statute had been declared unconstitutional at all.  ""Evelyn"" tells the story of the man whose civil action made this decision come about.Desmond Doyle was a blue-collar Dublin painter and decorator, left to take care of his daughter Evelyn and her brothers alone after his wife had run away with another man.  Jobless, penniless and more given to drowning his sorrows in Guinness than addressing them head-on, he was ill-suited for the task, and it didn't take long for church and state to step in and decree that, under prevalent law, Evelyn and her brothers were to be committed to Catholic orphanage schools.  Certain that he wouldn't be able to afford a lawyer - and having been told that his case was hopeless anyway - Doyle unsuccessfully tried to regain his children by other means, his methods of choice being bullying and abduction.  Eventually he met Irish American attorney Nick Barron, who was willing to take on Doyle's case pro bono, together with his Dublin colleagues Michael Beattie and Tom Connolly, Irish rugby-idol-turned-family-law-expert, whose counsel would prove instrumental both in securing public support for Doyle's case and in drafting Barron's victorious argument.Written by Paul Pender, who had met the real Evelyn Doyle at a conference, the movie's screenplay made its way onto the desk of Pierce Brosnan, who almost immediately decided to take it on, on a low budget basis - fortunately so, as the project is patently unfit for a large, Hollywood-style production - and soon also decided to play the role of Desmond Doyle.  And what at first sight may look like a surprising choice for the actor so much better known for roles like James Bond and Remington Steele was in fact a close match for Brosnan, who grew up in the 1950s' Ireland and intimately knows the ins and outs of Catholic schools, which, judging by his observations on the commentary track, obviously left a profound mark; bitter aftertaste rather than cozy memories of happy days gone by.Brosnan and co-producer Beau St. Clair were able to secure a perfect and, particularly considering the project's overall size, rather high-profile cast, with Aidan Quinn starring as Nick Barron, Stephen Rea as Michael Beattie, the great Alan Bates in one of his last-ever roles as the flawed but truly grand Tom Connolly (who declares whiskey a more reliable companion than God, but brings rosary beads to the court hearing ""to count the scores,"" and who sees hope even in the most desperate ""St. Judes,"" named for the patron saint of hopeless cases); Julianna Margulies, with as flawless an Irish accent as the rest of the cast, as Beattie's sister Bernadette, who is courted by both Doyle and Barron (guess who gets the girl ... and nothing against Pierce Brosnan, but I'd so wish for Quinn to luck out once only, too!), the eminently likeable Frank Kelly as Desmond Doyle's father, John Lynch as senior government counsel Wolfe - and young Sophie Vavasseur in the title role: a true find, with an instant charm and screen presence making it almost unbelievable that she had never acted before.Thanks to the subtle performances given by all of its actors, as well as Bruce Beresford's admirable and restrained direction, ""Evelyn"" is a gentle and despite its serious subject tremendously uplifting film, with a perfect blend of passion, poetry and tender humor, staying with you long after the end credits have run.  Although it occasionally scrapes by cliche just so (e.g., was it really necessary to expressly bring up ""David vs. Goliath"" in a movie whose entire premise is clearly based on this very concept?), its imagery is the most powerful when expressed from Evelyn's point of view:  her shock at seeing her mother drive off with a stranger, her anger at witnessing a nun lashing out at a girl for not knowing her catechism ... and her unshakeable faith in her grandfather, who has explained to her, when taking her to her convent school, that the sun rays breaking through the clouds are ""angel rays,"" sent by her guardian angel as a token of protection; and whose presence she feels, even after he has died of a heart attack, whenever she sees the sun coming through the gray Irish winter sky. - At one point during the production, it looked like the movie was going to have to live without a music score - that is, apart from the Irish songs performed live by Frank Kelly (who is also a trained violinist) and Pierce Brosnan (another ""first"" for him, and certainly one that will delight many of his fans), as part of the Doyles' pub music venture.  But fortunately a full soundtrack was ensured eventually, and Stephen Endelman's score - perfectly complimented by Gemma Hayes's ""Angel Rays"" and Van Morrison's ""Sitting on Top of the World"" - greatly adds to the movie's lyrical quality.  This is one of the year 2002's true cinematic ""finds""; a small, quietly shining gem.  Bravo, Messrs. Brosnan, Beresford & Co.!  I hope Irish Dreamtime Productions will give us more films like this in the future ... and when sun rays break through a cloudy sky, I will never again look at them the way I used to.Also

739169,A1IWVIOBEMZ5OQ,B00008DDVT,Timothy D. Naegele,"[5, 6]","A lovely ""small"" film, which stars Pierce Brosnan (as ""Desmond Doyle"") and was produced by him.  He plays an Irish father of three small children, whose mother has deserted them, and who are placed in schools run by the Catholic Church because he is deemed to be a drunkard who can't provide for them.  He straightens out his life, with the help of Julianna Margulies, and the assistance of three lawyers who are played by the excellent Stephen Rea, Aidan Quinn and Alan Bates.  Directed by Bruce Beresford, it takes one back to 1950s Ireland, and the hold that the Church exercised over daily life.Doyle fights for his kids, who are delightful, anchored by the lovely ""Evelyn"" played by Sophie Vavasseur.  When one views her talents, we think immediately what a great match she and the wonderful Freddie Highmore (""Finding Neverland,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") might make.  Despite going through living hell, Doyle triumphs in the end; and this true story is a refreshing film to watch, amidst the wasteland of senseless American movies that the big Hollywood studios churn out--which are inane, not uplifting, and have no lasting meaning or value.Brosnan is to be congratulated for taking a script by Paul Pender and bringing it to life.  It is well worth watching; the special features are enjoyable too; and the musical score is memorable--not the least of which is ""Angel Rays"" written and performed by Gemma Hayes, ""Sitting On Top Of The World"" written and performed by Van Morrison, and Brosnan's singing as well.  Ireland is a lovely, beautiful country; and once again, a film like this one gives viewers, who have never visited the exquisite Emerald Isle, a glimpse into the very special life and people there.

739170,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00008DDVT,Tucker Andersen,"[11, 11]","Director Bruce Beresford does an excellent job of translating this true story into an understated yet moving and ultimately heartwarming story of perserverance, love, human frailty, and faith. Pierce Brosman is both the coproducer and central character Desmond Doyle (although only one of the stars). The attraction for Brosnan of both the story and the role are obvious; he and Beresford deserve praise for their belief in the power of the story and their choice to tell it in a straightforward way with minimal embellishments or sentimentality.Doyle is an Irish tradesman whose wife tires of their struggles and leaves him and their two boys and daughter Emily on the day after Christmas,1953. Given Doyle's unemployment and limited prospects and under the dictates of Irish family law at that time, the government places the brothers and Emily in separate Catholic orphanages. The film traces Desmond's efforts to both gain employment and eventually reform his heavy drinking habits, followed by his subsequent frustration with the government bureaucratic and court decisions that prohibit him from reuniting his family. He eventually enlists the support of two lawyers (Steven Rhea, Aidan Quinn) who consult a retired well known law professor (Alan Bates, coincidently Desmond's childhood idol as a famous rugby player) who reluctantly agrees to aid in the preparation of their case and eventually devises a strategy to challenge the law as unconstitutional. But this is not presented as a David vs. Goliath battle, but simply as an imperfect but devoted father determined to explore all possible means to be reunited with his children.All the performaces were excellent and true to the story. Frank Kelly had an essential role as Desmond's father, and helped provide some of the infectious Irish music which was a key element in Desmond's transformation. Juliana Margulies played the barmaid and love interest to whom his lawyer was also attracted (in one of the few devices utilized to enliven the plot).  Alan Bates role was wonderful and his performance was superb; however, the story rang true because of the acting of Sophie Vavasseur in the title role of Evelyn, Desmond's smart, loving, principled daughter whose love for her father and religious conviction in the truth and belief in goodness and God's love allowed her to maintain her faith that their family would eventually be reunited and helped provide her father with the strength that he needed.I strongly recommend this movie for those theater goers who want to see excellent performances and an interesting and powerful story. It is relatively short (just over an hour and a half), and is in direct contrast to most modern films which attempt to overwhelm you with some combination of special effects, action, comedy, extreme emotional impact, excruciating detail or vulgarity. I was tempted to rate it five stars, and while in the end I decided that it did not quite rise to the top rating it is definitely a four star plus.",4,An Interesting True Story and an Excellent  Movie,1043193600,"01 22, 2003",2003,2997,"['Director', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'excellent', 'job', 'translating', 'true', 'story', 'understated', 'yet', 'moving', 'ultimately', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'perserverance', 'love', 'human', 'frailty', 'faith', 'Pierce', 'Brosman', 'coproducer', 'central', 'character', 'Desmond', 'Doyle', 'only', 'one', 'stars', 'attraction', 'Brosnan', 'story', 'role', 'are', 'obvious', 'Beresford', 'deserve', 'praise', 'belief', 'power', 'story', 'choice', 'tell', 'straightforward', 'way', 'minimal', 'embellishments', 'sentimentality.Doyle', 'Irish', 'tradesman', 'wife', 'tires', 'struggles', 'two', 'boys', 'daughter', 'Emily', 'day', 'Christmas,1953', 'Given', 'Doyle', 'unemployment', 'limited', 'prospects', 'dictates', 'Irish', 'family', 'law', 'time', 'government', 'brothers', 'Emily', 'separate', 'Catholic', 'orphanages', 'film', 'Desmond', 'efforts', 'gain', 'employment', 'eventually', 'reform', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'habits', 'followed', 'subsequent', 'frustration', 'government', 'bureaucratic', 'court', 'decisions', 'prohibit', 'reuniting', 'family', 'eventually', 'support', 'two', 'lawyers', 'Steven', 'Rhea', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'who', 'consult', 'retired', 'well', 'known', 'law', 'professor', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'coincidently', 'Desmond', 'childhood', 'idol', 'famous', 'rugby', 'player', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'aid', 'preparation', 'case', 'eventually', 'strategy', 'challenge', 'law', 'unconstitutional', 'not', 'presented', 'David', 'vs.', 'Goliath', 'battle', 'simply', 'imperfect', 'devoted', 'father', 'determined', 'explore', 'possible', 'means', 'be', 'reunited', 'children.All', 'performaces', 'were', 'excellent', 'true', 'story', 'Frank', 'Kelly', 'had', 'essential', 'role', 'Desmond', 'father', 'helped', 'provide', 'infectious', 'Irish', 'music', 'was', 'key', 'element', 'Desmond', 'transformation', 'Juliana', 'Margulies', 'played', 'barmaid', 'love', 'interest', 'whom', 'lawyer', 'was', 'also', 'attracted', 'one', 'few', 'devices', 'utilized', 'enliven', 'plot', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'role', 'was', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'was', 'superb', 'however', 'story', 'rang', 'true', 'acting', 'Sophie', 'Vavasseur', 'title', 'role', 'Evelyn', 'Desmond', 'smart', 'loving', 'principled', 'daughter', 'love', 'father', 'religious', 'conviction', 'truth', 'belief', 'goodness', 'God', 'love', 'allowed', 'maintain', 'faith', 'family', 'would', 'eventually', 'be', 'reunited', 'helped', 'provide', 'father', 'strength', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'theater', 'goers', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'excellent', 'performances', 'interesting', 'powerful', 'story', 'relatively', 'short', 'just', 'hour', 'half', 'direct', 'contrast', 'most', 'modern', 'films', 'attempt', 'overwhelm', 'combination', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'comedy', 'extreme', 'emotional', 'impact', 'excruciating', 'detail', 'vulgarity', 'was', 'tempted', 'rate', 'five', 'stars', 'end', 'decided', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'rise', 'top', 'rating', 'definitely', 'four', 'star']",Evelyn
