Oliver,"[33, 39]","My Uncle went to Vietnam, volunteer, and though he said he found it to leave out some information, he found the entire documentary quite thorough in its details of the war as he remembered it.  He pointed out only a few details that they brought out about the reasons for going, the problems with the stay, and the internal combustion of the government who tried to fight the war instead of letting the soldiers fight it that he thought were really interesting, and really true to his opinion of what happened to the war.  He felt all and all that this documentary was good for someone that was there, and certainly good for me, who wasn't even alive then.",4,MY Uncle Says,1215734400,"07 11, 2008",2008,656,"['Uncle', 'went', 'Vietnam', 'volunteer', 'said', 'found', 'leave', 'out', 'information', 'found', 'entire', 'documentary', 'quite', 'thorough', 'details', 'war', 'remembered', 'pointed', 'out', 'only', 'few', 'details', 'brought', 'out', 'reasons', 'going', 'problems', 'stay', 'internal', 'combustion', 'government', 'who', 'tried', 'fight', 'war', 'instead', 'letting', 'soldiers', 'fight', 'thought', 'were', 'really', 'interesting', 'really', 'true', 'opinion', 'what', 'happened', 'war', 'felt', 'documentary', 'was', 'good', 'someone', 'was', 'there', 'certainly', 'good', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'alive', 'then']",The Vietnam War

1111084,A7CABQIWL33FQ,B000WOSB0K,"seth ""wa""","[25, 32]","I've  read all the reviews, I've seem  all the movies and Documentaries,nothing comes close to what Viet Nam was like for the Combat Vet.  I served 3 tours in Viet Nam and what this does not show  like all the others, was the smells and oders of the dead and dying ,that is something you can never forget or never describe.  The true sounds of the war.  What it felt like  to see your best friend in pieces on the ground. I to was a Volenteer, and came back 3 times total, not because I loved it but I was young dumb and single. I really thought I could save a Dad with kids from going over. War is War  I won't go into the details this missed or  was right about it. When I came back from my last tour I was in the Hospital For  over a Year. During the last few month I was able to leave the hospital for afew hours, that I loved , what I hated we were not allowed to wear our uniforms off base.  Seems they were offencive to many of the locals. The things that went on in that country cost me alot , my first heart attack at 29, 3 bouts with cancer, at 61 I can bearly walk, but that is ok I am better off then many. For many many year I hate what the war did to me and others ,  I hated the way We were treated when we came home, I hate the fact that many more died after coming home from everything for cancer to taking their own lives.  For year I could not stand watching how good the troops were treated when they were coming home from other wars, I felt cheat again, I was jealous. Two weeks ago that all changed.  I was in a Fry's store (a supermarket ) It was Vetern's week so Had on a Viet Nam vet  hat and shirt. I was standing looking at something and felt a light tapping on my back.  I turn to find what looked to be a brother and sister  maybe  7 to 8 years old, they looked up at me ( i could see just alittle fear in their eyes ).  The little girl said to me ""Welcome Home  and the Little boy  put out his hand for me to shake and said to me  ""  Thank you for Serving "".  I know it was the parents that told the kids what to do and say. I  thanked them both with a salute and a thank you and spent the rest of my time in the store  with  tears in my eyes.  That meant more to me then all the metals, everything. If you want to change a Vets life especially  a Viet Nam Vet next time you see one please just take a second and say ""Welcome Home ""  thank you for your time  and to All Vets  From All Wars,  THANK YOU  AND WELCOME HOME ,,,,,,,,,,",3,The View of a Viet Nam Combat Vet,1290384000,"11 22, 2010",2010,2460,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seem', 'movies', 'Documentaries', 'nothing', 'close', 'what', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'was', 'Combat', 'Vet', 'served', '3', 'tours', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'what', 'not', 'show', 'others', 'was', 'smells', 'oders', 'dead', 'dying', 'something', 'can', 'never', 'forget', 'never', 'describe', 'true', 'sounds', 'war', 'What', 'felt', 'see', 'best', 'friend', 'pieces', 'ground', 'was', 'Volenteer', 'came', 'back', '3', 'times', 'total', 'not', 'loved', 'was', 'young', 'dumb', 'single', 'really', 'thought', 'could', 'save', 'Dad', 'kids', 'going', 'War', 'War', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'missed', 'was', 'right', 'When', 'came', 'back', 'last', 'tour', 'was', 'Hospital', 'Year', 'last', 'few', 'month', 'was', 'able', 'leave', 'hospital', 'afew', 'hours', 'loved', 'what', 'hated', 'were', 'not', 'allowed', 'wear', 'uniforms', 'base', 'were', 'offencive', 'many', 'locals', 'things', 'went', 'country', 'cost', 'alot', 'first', 'heart', 'attack', '29', '3', 'bouts', 'cancer', '61', 'can', 'bearly', 'walk', 'ok', 'am', 'better', 'off', 'then', 'many', 'many', 'many', 'year', 'hate', 'what', 'war', 'did', 'others', 'hated', 'way', 'were', 'treated', 'when', 'came', 'home', 'hate', 'fact', 'many', 'more', 'died', 'coming', 'home', 'everything', 'cancer', 'taking', 'own', 'lives', 'year', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'watching', 'how', 'good', 'troops', 'were', 'treated', 'when', 'were', 'coming', 'home', 'other', 'wars', 'felt', 'cheat', 'again', 'was', 'jealous', 'Two', 'weeks', 'changed', 'was', 'Fry', 'store', 'supermarket', 'was', 'Vetern', 'week', 'so', 'Had', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'hat', 'shirt', 'was', 'standing', 'looking', 'something', 'felt', 'light', 'tapping', 'back', 'turn', 'find', 'what', 'looked', 'be', 'brother', 'sister', 'maybe', '7', '8', 'years', 'old', 'looked', 'up', 'i', 'could', 'see', 'just', 'alittle', 'fear', 'eyes', 'little', 'girl', 'said', 'Welcome', 'Home', 'Little', 'boy', 'put', 'out', 'hand', 'shake', 'said', 'Thank', 'Serving', 'know', 'was', 'parents', 'told', 'kids', 'what', 'do', 'say', 'thanked', 'salute', 'thank', 'spent', 'rest', 'time', 'store', 'tears', 'eyes', 'meant', 'more', 'then', 'metals', 'everything', 'want', 'change', 'Vets', 'life', 'especially', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'Vet', 'next', 'time', 'see', 'one', 'please', 'just', 'take', 'second', 'say', 'Welcome', 'Home', 'thank', 'time', 'All', 'Vets', 'Wars', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'AND', 'WELCOME', 'HOME']",The Vietnam War
