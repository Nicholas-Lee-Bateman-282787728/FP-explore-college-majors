I pretty much agree with most others about her abilities. I usually prefer concerts that use other dancers and singers along with the star because I think that it makes the program more interesting. I look for pleasant voices that sings this type of music. I have never heard Nella Fantasia sung so beautifully before. I agree with some that she is not an opera singer. When I want opera, I buy opera. I personally prefer DVD's so I can see the performer as I listen. I recommend her.",5,talented girl,1319155200,"10 21, 2011",2011,587,"['was', 'introduced', 'Katherine', 'You-Tube', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'so', 'ordered', 'concert', 'O2', 'pretty', 'much', 'agree', 'most', 'others', 'abilities', 'usually', 'prefer', 'concerts', 'use', 'other', 'dancers', 'singers', 'star', 'think', 'program', 'more', 'interesting', 'look', 'pleasant', 'voices', 'type', 'music', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Nella', 'Fantasia', 'sung', 'so', 'beautifully', 'agree', 'not', 'opera', 'singer', 'When', 'want', 'opera', 'buy', 'personally', 'prefer', 'DVD', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'performer', 'listen', 'recommend']",Katherine Jenkins: Believe - Live From The O2

1378690,A35O0A08A6SDZR,B00403CLK0,R. S.,"[7, 16]","This is by far the worst Popera/Classical Crossover DVD that I've ever seen and I have a large collection of them. I simply threw this out it's so bad. Katherine Jenkins has a great mezzo voice and a wonderful personality that sparkles in her two previous DVDs. Her ""Live In the park"" and ""Live at Llangollen"" DVDs are exceptional. Her CDs are exceptional. In this DVD, her voice is totally lost to over boosted background music.Her producer is also sending Jenkins down the sad ""Sarah Brightmann path"" of performing in extreme floor shows with extreme lighting and dancers that are totally unrelated to why people like the performer and buy her music.If you want to purchase a DVD of full of background music played by unknowns, a bunch of unknown dancers, a light show that makes it difficult to see Katherine Jenkins and you do not want to hear her sing, this is the DVD for you!",1,Simply the worst!,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,882,"['far', 'worst', 'Popera/Classical', 'Crossover', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'large', 'collection', 'simply', 'threw', 'so', 'bad', 'Katherine', 'Jenkins', 'great', 'mezzo', 'voice', 'wonderful', 'personality', 'two', 'previous', 'DVDs', 'Live', 'park', 'Live', 'Llangollen', 'DVDs', 'are', 'exceptional', 'CDs', 'are', 'exceptional', 'DVD', 'voice', 'totally', 'lost', 'boosted', 'background', 'music.Her', 'producer', 'also', 'sending', 'Jenkins', 'sad', 'Sarah', 'Brightmann', 'path', 'performing', 'extreme', 'floor', 'shows', 'extreme', 'lighting', 'dancers', 'are', 'totally', 'unrelated', 'why', 'people', 'performer', 'buy', 'music.If', 'want', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'full', 'background', 'music', 'played', 'unknowns', 'bunch', 'unknown', 'dancers', 'light', 'show', 'difficult', 'see', 'Katherine', 'Jenkins', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'hear', 'sing', 'DVD']",Katherine Jenkins: Believe - Live From The O2
