981451,A3LBAIMC1B8FW6,B000F1IQJ6,April,"[3, 15]","I must say that this DVD seriously disappointed me.  I absolutely hated it.  I heard that Zumanity was a more ""adult"" show.  I figured that maybe the costumes would have a little less fabric, and that the show would be more sexual than other shows.  But I figured that it was the Cirque, even if the above were true, at least it would be done tastefully.  I NEVER expected to see what I saw.  I was so extremely disappointed.  Not just with the DVD, but also with Cirque.This DVD is the behind the scenes beginning of the show.  But I still saw more T&A; than I expected to see.  (And the actors were told that they were playing it too sae and needed to show more.)  And it was not done tastefully.  I truely think that a strip joint would have more class than this show does.  I'm not one that is easily offended, but I couldn't even finish watching the dvd.  It was absolutely terrible.  I'm tempted to send it through the cd shredder.I'm just glad I bought the video before wasting money on a trip to see the show.",1,Shred-Worthy,1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,1017,"['must', 'say', 'DVD', 'seriously', 'disappointed', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'heard', 'Zumanity', 'was', 'more', 'adult', 'show', 'figured', 'maybe', 'costumes', 'would', 'have', 'little', 'less', 'fabric', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'sexual', 'other', 'shows', 'figured', 'was', 'Cirque', 'even', 'above', 'were', 'true', 'least', 'would', 'be', 'done', 'tastefully', 'NEVER', 'expected', 'see', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'so', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'Not', 'just', 'DVD', 'also', 'Cirque.This', 'DVD', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'show', 'still', 'saw', 'more', 'T', 'A', 'expected', 'see', 'actors', 'were', 'told', 'were', 'playing', 'too', 'sae', 'needed', 'show', 'more', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'tastefully', 'truely', 'think', 'strip', 'joint', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'class', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'easily', 'offended', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'finish', 'watching', 'dvd', 'was', 'absolutely', 'terrible', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'send', 'cd', 'shredder.I', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'bought', 'video', 'wasting', 'money', 'trip', 'see', 'show']",Cirque du Soleil - Lovesick

I mailed a letter expressing my disappointment to Cirque du Soleil's headquarters in Montreal.Wait for the Zumanity DVD to come out.  This DVD chronicles only a handful of the performers.  Joey the drag queen emcee from NYC, the British ballet dancer (she was too boring to remember her name), a strong man from Miami and two other lackluster women.  The strongman's best attributes are his muscles and girlfriend.As long as they are not hurting anyone, I do not care about the people behind the scenes.Zumanity is a great, controversial show.  This DVD does not do justice to Zumanity.  It provides just a blink of an eye view of Zumanity through a keyhole.The material on this DVD is more suited as ""Bonus Features"" on the real Zumanity DVD.Cirque du Soleil never offered a DVD like this before.  What inane logic made them release this DVD?  With any luck, they will never release another DVD like this again.",1,Disappointing,1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,1012,"['have', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', ""DVD's.This"", 'first', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'DVD', 'disappointed', 'mailed', 'letter', 'expressing', 'disappointment', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'headquarters', 'Montreal.Wait', 'Zumanity', 'DVD', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'only', 'handful', 'performers', 'Joey', 'drag', 'queen', 'emcee', 'NYC', 'British', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'was', 'too', 'boring', 'remember', 'name', 'strong', 'man', 'Miami', 'two', 'other', 'lackluster', 'women', 'strongman', 'best', 'attributes', 'are', 'muscles', 'girlfriend.As', 'long', 'are', 'not', 'hurting', 'anyone', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'people', 'scenes.Zumanity', 'great', 'controversial', 'show', 'DVD', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'Zumanity', 'just', 'blink', 'eye', 'view', 'Zumanity', 'keyhole.The', 'material', 'DVD', 'more', 'suited', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'real', 'Zumanity', 'DVD.Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'never', 'offered', 'DVD', 'before', 'What', 'inane', 'logic', 'made', 'release', 'DVD', 'luck', 'will', 'never', 'release', 'DVD', 'again']",Cirque du Soleil - Lovesick

I sensed from the preview it was risqu&eacute;, but......  Oh my, oh my!  Now I must hide ""Love Sick"" in the family room.  I can appreciate the courage of the directors, artist in bolding stepping out of the traditional box.  Of course, Cirque du Soleil is not traditional in any sense.  Your gifts of imagination and interpretation have always been amazing, beautiful, thrilling, motivational, funny and dramatic to name a few!

981456,A7J6F8ZSQLEIC,B000F1IQJ6,The Red-Blue Blur,"[2, 2]","I saw ""Zumanity"" in Las Vegas in 2011 and it was the best show I've ever seen in my life! I have never forgotten it and its performers. Amazing doesn't even begin to describe the show. I picked up the DVD ""Lovesick"" for a whopping three bucks at Big Lots and was hoping it would recreate my viewing experience of the actual ""Zumanity"" show. It was interesting and showcased the behind-the-scenes drama the performers go through, but I didn't recognize most of them. Joey, the drag queen emcee, has since been replaced by another drag performer called Edie. I would have liked to have seen more clips of the performances I remember, such as the two Asian women swimming in the big water bowl, the hula hoop lady named Julia Kolosova, and the two fat redheaded ladies with the strawberries tray. I did enjoy the documentary, but I'm glad I didn't pay more than three dollars for it.",4,Interesting documentary but a bit outdated now.,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,880,"['saw', 'Zumanity', 'Las', 'Vegas', '2011', 'was', 'best', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'performers', 'Amazing', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'describe', 'show', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'Lovesick', 'whopping', 'three', 'bucks', 'Big', 'Lots', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'recreate', 'viewing', 'experience', 'actual', 'Zumanity', 'show', 'was', 'interesting', 'showcased', 'behind-the-scenes', 'drama', 'performers', 'go', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'most', 'Joey', 'drag', 'queen', 'emcee', 'been', 'replaced', 'drag', 'performer', 'called', 'Edie', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'clips', 'performances', 'remember', 'such', 'two', 'Asian', 'women', 'swimming', 'big', 'water', 'bowl', 'hula', 'hoop', 'lady', 'named', 'Julia', 'Kolosova', 'two', 'fat', 'redheaded', 'ladies', 'strawberries', 'tray', 'did', 'enjoy', 'documentary', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'more', 'three', 'dollars']",Cirque du Soleil - Lovesick
