1120609,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B000YQAMZ8,Amanda Richards,"[41, 45]","This well acted drama is a wakeup call to the horrors of the alleged practice of ""extraordinary rendition"", where persons suspected of being involved in terrorist activities are apprehended and sent to another country to be interrogated (translate: tortured)Based upon one cell phone record and an Islamic name, chemical engineer Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) is removed from a flight from South Africa to Washington D.C. and sent to an interrogation centre, where he is questioned, beaten and abused for proclaiming his innocence.The movie uses flashbacks and lots of switching between characters to illustrate the chain reaction that results, and how it affects not only El-Ibrahimi, but also his wife (Reese Witherspoon), his family, an observing CIA analyst (Jake Gyllenhaal), and even his torturer, Abasi Fawal.In a gripping sub-plot, Fawal's daughter secretly becomes romantically involved with a young man, not knowing that his brother had perished at the hands of her father.Chilling at times, and maddening at others, especially when Meryl Streep's character gets involved, this movie is about the suffering of the innocent as a result of the sins of a minority.

1120610,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000YQAMZ8,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","Here is my issue with `Rendition'; it has a decent enough story, and the actors involved (all of them) are capable, yet nothing seems to come together fluidly since the film is too busy trying to make a lot out of very little.  The movie tries to expand on a single action (the rendition of an Egyptian born man suspected of terrorism) and show how it reaches out over the lives of many, but in doing so it manages only to stretch characters thin of really any emotional attachment.  We don't get to know anyone long enough to feel a part of their story, and the films timeline becomes confusing and (in the end) kind of preposterous (that's one way to tag a twist ending onto a film).  It just feels forced.  Thankfully the actors involved work hard to elevate their material, it's just a shame that the material isn't strong enough to support their performances.  The best in show here is easily Jake Gyllenhaal, who finally proves that he can walk amidst more consistent actors (Streep, Witherspoon, Arkin, Sarsgaard) and stand out.  The way he layers the guilt crushing down on his `CIA agent thrust into unfamiliar territory' is rather remarkable.  For as thin as the script is, he builds a solid foundation here.  Witherspoon could have been better, but she winds up feeling underdeveloped and unbelievable.  Naor is nothing but a stereotype and while Sarsgaard and Streep give spirited and `lived in' performances, the characters they are handed are paper thin and it is obvious that the film is uninterested in them (although their confrontation scene is one of the best in the film).  Sadly, we forget all about the `important message' the film is trying to relay about an `important subject' because nothing is focused.

The problem is incorporating the message without ramming it down the audience's throat. Or not losing the audience in a quagmire of politicalese.Syrianasuffered from the latter, while this one suffered only slightly under the strain of throat ramming and some poor character development (or minimal screen time).The film's premise is based on the U.S. legal maneuver known as ""extraordinary rendition,"" which, when translated, means the deportation of suspected terrorists to countries outside the U.S. for interrogation (see torture).Names, a person's birth country, and the color of one's skin come into play strongly, giving the flick a well-deserved sense of political bigotry. When Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally,Munich) comes back to the U.S. (his adopted home country) he is met at the airport by agents who quickly stuff him into a van and whisk him off to a far-away country. The big question is why? The reality is startling. When a U.S. agent is accidentally killed, the U.S. terrorists chasers want a scapegoat or, at the very least, someone to cop to helping the one who did it. And poor Anwar just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time (with the wrong name and skin color).Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain) stars as a CIA operative who has to witness firsthand the ""interrogation"" of Amwar. Having been friends with the American who was killed, Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal) quickly loses his stomach for the methods used by the U.S.- backed, foreign interrogators.Back in America, Amwar's pregnant wife Isabella (Reese Witherspoon,Walk the Line) is wondering why he hasn't returned home. Calling upon an old beau named Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard,Jarhead) who works for Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin,Little Miss Sunshine), Isabella is given the runaround by the higher-ups regarding her husband's whereabouts. Finally given the name of a homeland security person named Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep,The Devil Wears Prada) she again butts heads with government silence on the policy of extraordinary rendition.Horrible and redeeming, RENDITION has plenty of strong actors who are given tidbit parts (except for Jake Gyllenhaal), giving much of the film an unidentifiable message from the standpoint of characters and our lack of caring for any of them.It is, however, well told. And the way the story works itself from beginning to end and then back again was pretty impressive (more of a parlor trick, though, but still fun to watch).",4,Torture: American Style,1225929600,"11 6, 2008",2008,2574,"['Films', 'incorporate', 'solid', 'political', 'message', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'problem', 'incorporating', 'message', 'ramming', 'down', 'audience', 'throat', 'not', 'losing', 'audience', 'quagmire', 'politicalese.Syrianasuffered', 'latter', 'one', 'suffered', 'only', 'slightly', 'strain', 'throat', 'ramming', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'minimal', 'screen', 'time', 'film', 'premise', 'based', 'U.S.', 'legal', 'maneuver', 'known', 'extraordinary', 'rendition', 'when', 'translated', 'deportation', 'suspected', 'terrorists', 'countries', 'U.S.', 'interrogation', 'see', 'torture', 'person', 'birth', 'country', 'color', 'one', 'skin', 'come', 'play', 'strongly', 'giving', 'flick', 'well-deserved', 'sense', 'political', 'bigotry', 'When', 'Anwar', 'El-Ibrahimi', 'Omar', 'Metwally', 'Munich', 'back', 'U.S.', 'adopted', 'home', 'country', 'met', 'airport', 'agents', 'who', 'quickly', 'stuff', 'van', 'whisk', 'off', 'far-away', 'country', 'big', 'question', 'why', 'reality', 'startling', 'When', 'U.S.', 'agent', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'U.S.', 'chasers', 'want', 'scapegoat', 'very', 'least', 'someone', 'cop', 'helping', 'one', 'who', 'did', 'poor', 'Anwar', 'just', 'be', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'wrong', 'name', 'skin', 'color', '.Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'CIA', 'operative', 'who', 'witness', 'firsthand', 'interrogation', 'Amwar', 'Having', 'been', 'friends', 'American', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'Douglas', 'Freeman', 'Gyllenhaal', 'quickly', 'stomach', 'methods', 'used', 'U.S.-', 'backed', 'foreign', 'interrogators.Back', 'America', 'Amwar', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Isabella', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Walk', 'Line', 'wondering', 'why', ""n't"", 'returned', 'home', 'Calling', 'old', 'beau', 'named', 'Alan', 'Smith', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Jarhead', 'who', 'Senator', 'Hawkins', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Isabella', 'given', 'runaround', 'higher-ups', 'regarding', 'husband', 'whereabouts', 'Finally', 'given', 'name', 'homeland', 'security', 'person', 'named', 'Corrine', 'Whitman', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'again', 'butts', 'heads', 'government', 'silence', 'policy', 'extraordinary', 'rendition.Horrible', 'redeeming', 'RENDITION', 'plenty', 'strong', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'tidbit', 'parts', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'giving', 'much', 'film', 'unidentifiable', 'message', 'standpoint', 'characters', 'lack', 'caring', 'them.It', 'however', 'well', 'told', 'way', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'then', 'back', 'again', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'more', 'parlor', 'trick', 'though', 'still', 'watch']",N/A

Because of practices like this, our country has forfeited the moral high ground.  Politics are seamlessly woven into the story, without making it feel like a piece of propaganda, making it an effective political thriller.  The movie operates at a good clip.  It depicts things that have happened and probably still happen.  There is no politically correct white-washing of just how scary radical Islam is.  The scenes of the young Muslim men being indoctrinated into hate and violence actually made me say ""whoa"" outloud.

1120626,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B000YQAMZ8,e. verrillo,"[2, 3]","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I fully expected the director, Gavin Hood, to dish up the same kind of bland Hollywood moralizing as he did in Crash. Instead, Hood's treatment of this politically charged subject was thoughtful, accurate and well told.The subject matter is, of course, rendition--the policy of seizing an individual and transporting him (usually a man) to a foreign country so as to circumvent US law (which would require due process). Once extradited, the individual has no rights. He can be tortured and held for an unlimited period of time without any formal accusation. He can be killed.Without going into the plot of the movie, which has been covered by other reviewers, I would like to say that based on my personal experience with the ""disappearance"" of individuals for political reasons, this movie was highly accurate. The only difference between Argentina's policy of disappearing ""delinquents"" during the Dirty War and our policy of doing the same to ""terrorists"" is terminology. Whether you call your enemies ""delinquents"", ""communists"", ""terrorists"", or ""Jews"" the end result is the same--the total destruction of the rule of law. What is so disturbing about this film, and the current policy of rendition, is that the damage is no longer limited to national borders. By transporting individuals to secret prisons all over the world, we have, in effect, created an international dictatorship in which no individual of any nationality has a right to due process. Once that notion takes hold, the law of the jungle is the only law there is. Those who are hired to capture, torture and transport ""terrorists"" will do so indiscriminately, and according to their own notions of what constitutes a threat to international security. (For example, I have heard members of the Guatemalan military claim that all Mayan Indians are ""born terrorists"".)This film is for those with strong stomachs, but if you find that the torture scenes are too tense for you, don't simply put the movie away. Be sure to watch ""Outlawed"", the documentary included in the special features. This was Hood's reason for making the film. Not only is the documentary deeply moving, it gives an absolutely clear argument for why rendition has made a mockery of everything the United States stands for.",5,Highly recommended,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,2303,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'fully', 'expected', 'director', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'dish', 'up', 'same', 'kind', 'bland', 'Hollywood', 'moralizing', 'did', 'Crash', 'Instead', 'Hood', 'treatment', 'politically', 'charged', 'subject', 'was', 'thoughtful', 'accurate', 'well', 'told.The', 'subject', 'matter', 'course', 'rendition', 'policy', 'seizing', 'individual', 'transporting', 'usually', 'man', 'foreign', 'country', 'so', 'circumvent', 'US', 'law', 'would', 'require', 'due', 'process', 'Once', 'extradited', 'individual', 'rights', 'can', 'be', 'tortured', 'held', 'unlimited', 'period', 'time', 'formal', 'accusation', 'can', 'be', 'killed.Without', 'going', 'plot', 'movie', 'been', 'covered', 'other', 'reviewers', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'based', 'personal', 'experience', 'disappearance', 'individuals', 'political', 'reasons', 'movie', 'was', 'highly', 'accurate', 'only', 'difference', 'Argentina', 'policy', 'disappearing', 'delinquents', 'Dirty', 'War', 'policy', 'doing', 'same', 'terrorists', 'terminology', 'call', 'enemies', 'delinquents', 'communists', 'terrorists', 'Jews', 'end', 'result', 'same', 'total', 'destruction', 'rule', 'law', 'What', 'so', 'disturbing', 'film', 'current', 'policy', 'rendition', 'damage', 'no', 'longer', 'limited', 'national', 'borders', 'transporting', 'individuals', 'secret', 'prisons', 'world', 'have', 'effect', 'created', 'international', 'dictatorship', 'individual', 'nationality', 'right', 'due', 'process', 'Once', 'notion', 'hold', 'law', 'jungle', 'only', 'law', 'who', 'are', 'hired', 'capture', 'torture', 'transport', 'terrorists', 'will', 'do', 'so', 'indiscriminately', 'according', 'own', 'notions', 'what', 'threat', 'international', 'security', 'example', 'have', 'heard', 'members', 'Guatemalan', 'military', 'claim', 'Mayan', 'Indians', 'are', 'born', 'terrorists', 'film', 'strong', 'stomachs', 'find', 'torture', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'tense', 'do', ""n't"", 'simply', 'put', 'movie', 'away', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'Outlawed', 'documentary', 'included', 'special', 'features', 'was', 'Hood', 'reason', 'making', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'documentary', 'deeply', 'moving', 'absolutely', 'clear', 'argument', 'why', 'rendition', 'made', 'mockery', 'everything', 'United', 'States']",N/A

On the down side, I am not a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal and subsequently I did not appreciate his being in this movie.The plot, the setting, the dialogues, and the music, are all very good.In short, Rendition is a movie definitely worth watching if you are in the mood for a good political thriller. 4.5 Stars",5,"""The United States does not torture, Douglas!""",1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,878,"['Rendition', 'sheds', 'light', 'post-9/11', 'practices', 'aimed', 'combating', 'terrorism', 'Egyptian-born', 'man', 'apprehended', 'United', 'States', 'following', 'trip', 'South', 'Africa', 'only', 'be', 'transported', 'secret', 'location', 'Egypt', 'where', 'torture', 'film', 'deals', 'several', 'stories', 'unfold', 'simantineously', 'end', 'movie', 'everything', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Omar', 'Metwally', 'most', 'rest', 'cast', 'carry', 'out', 'performances', 'well', 'Yigal', 'Naor', 'primarily', 'Peter', 'Saarsgard', 'secondarily', 'steal', 'show', 'down', 'side', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'subsequently', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'being', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'setting', 'dialogues', 'music', 'are', 'very', 'good.In', 'short', 'Rendition', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'mood', 'good', 'political', 'thriller', '4.5', 'Stars']",N/A

1120642,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000YQAMZ8,Linda Linguvic,"[63, 65]","This 2007 film is scary.  That's because the theme is about the practice of interrogating suspected terrorists in a foreign country where laws against torture do not apply.  This practice is called rendition and  this film makes it real.  It's hard to watch.The film opens in an American middle class suburb.  Reese Witherspoon is playing with her small son when they get a phone call from her husband, Omar Metwally, an Egyptian citizen who has lived in America for 20 years.  He tells his wife and son he is on the way home from a business trip and they plan on meeting him at the airport.  All seems well.When he gets off the plane, however, he is detained at the airport and questioned.  He is a chemical engineer and the questioners are asking questions about a terrorist bomb plot.  He denies everything.  He seems clean but Meryl Streep, playing a high powered Washington decision maker, orders him to be put into rendition and he is whisked away to an unnamed middle eastern country and his name erased from the plane's passenger log while his wife and son wait patiently at the airport for a husband and father who has disappeared.The scene now shifts to an unnamed middle eastern country where Yagal Noor, an Israeli actor of Jewish Iraqi descent, is cast in the role of the interrogator.  Jake Gyllenhaal is cast as an American diplomat, who has just lost a co-worker in a suicide bombing, and has been promoted to assist Yagal Noor with the questioning.  It is awful.  I am cringing now just writing about it as scenes of waterboarding and electric shock torture are shown in detail.  There is also a subplot about the interrogator's daughter and a suicide bomber which expands the story.In the meantime Reese Witherspoon is trying desperately to find her husband.  She seeks out an old boyfriend, played by Peter Sarsgaard who works for a senator, played by Alan Arkin.  Even when they confront Meryl Streep, there is a blank wall of silence.  Jake Gyllenhaal, however, is beginning to have a change of heart as the torturing goes on.This is a serious film about a serious topic.  It will make you cringe and it will also make you think.  I give it a high recommendation but it is not recommended for the faint of heart.",5,A serious film about a serious topic that will make you cringe,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,2233,"['2007', 'film', 'scary', 'theme', 'practice', 'interrogating', 'suspected', 'terrorists', 'foreign', 'country', 'where', 'laws', 'torture', 'do', 'not', 'apply', 'practice', 'called', 'rendition', 'film', 'real', 'hard', 'watch.The', 'film', 'opens', 'American', 'middle', 'class', 'suburb', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'playing', 'small', 'son', 'when', 'get', 'phone', 'call', 'husband', 'Omar', 'Metwally', 'Egyptian', 'citizen', 'who', 'lived', 'America', '20', 'years', 'wife', 'son', 'way', 'home', 'business', 'trip', 'plan', 'meeting', 'airport', 'plane', 'however', 'detained', 'airport', 'questioned', 'chemical', 'engineer', 'questioners', 'are', 'asking', 'questions', 'terrorist', 'bomb', 'plot', 'everything', 'clean', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'playing', 'high', 'powered', 'Washington', 'decision', 'maker', 'orders', 'be', 'put', 'rendition', 'whisked', 'away', 'unnamed', 'middle', 'eastern', 'country', 'name', 'erased', 'plane', 'passenger', 'log', 'wife', 'son', 'wait', 'patiently', 'airport', 'husband', 'father', 'who', 'disappeared.The', 'scene', 'now', 'unnamed', 'middle', 'eastern', 'country', 'where', 'Yagal', 'Noor', 'Israeli', 'actor', 'Jewish', 'Iraqi', 'descent', 'cast', 'role', 'interrogator', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'cast', 'American', 'diplomat', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'co-worker', 'suicide', 'bombing', 'been', 'promoted', 'assist', 'Yagal', 'Noor', 'questioning', 'awful', 'am', 'cringing', 'now', 'just', 'writing', 'about', 'scenes', 'waterboarding', 'electric', 'shock', 'torture', 'are', 'shown', 'detail', 'also', 'subplot', 'interrogator', 'daughter', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'story.In', 'meantime', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'trying', 'desperately', 'find', 'husband', 'out', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'senator', 'played', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Even', 'when', 'confront', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'blank', 'wall', 'silence', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'however', 'beginning', 'have', 'change', 'heart', 'torturing', 'on.This', 'serious', 'film', 'serious', 'topic', 'will', 'make', 'cringe', 'will', 'also', 'make', 'think', 'give', 'high', 'recommendation', 'not', 'recommended', 'faint', 'heart']",N/A

Torture by proxy is the most abhorrent form of torture, because it frees you from direct involvement in what is being done to another person.Since 9/11, the CIA has reportedly launched an investigation into such cases of ""erroneous rendition"" where suspects were subject to rendition, confessed to crimes they didn't commit and were later found to be innocent civilians.The subject of rendition in this movie is a wrongfully accused Egyptian born engineer (Omar Metwally), who lives in the United States with his wife (Reese Witherspoon) and child.For the first time in his life, CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal) watches this torture, led by Fawal (Yiqal Naor, who gracefully played Saddam Husain in ""House of Saddam""), and chooses to take a moral stand despite his boss's disapproval.  At the same time, in juxtaposition to the torture event, a young suicide bomber, under the powerful control of a terrorist group, makes his own moral choice.Great performances and a great story, enhanced by the presence of Meryl Streep and Yiqal Naor. Some might find the idea of a CIA member standing up to his bosses or a suicide bomber saying no to his recruiters incredible. In real life both people might not survive, but I believe that some hope still exist and the duty of the director and the movie is to propose the possibility of hope.Is the idea of hero who dares to change things, merely a dream?

He's married to Reese Witherspoon, has a young son and another child on the way.On his way back to his home in Chicago from a scientific conference in South Africa, he is intercepted at the Washington D.C. airport and taken into custody by the CIA.

Even though he passes a lie detector test and there is no credible evidence against him, CIA chief Meryl Streep orders that he be sent back to Africa for interrogation and torture.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a low level CIA agent, assigned to oversee Metwally's interrogation.  He becomes increasingly uncomfortable with what he observes, particularly after he becomes convinced that the man is innocent.Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard are cast as the U.S. Senator and his chief aide to whom Witherspoon turns when her husband disappears.RENDITION, directed by Gavin Hood, is a tense, exciting political thriller that follows multiple characters and storylines to a powerful climax.

Actually, the brief documentary about rendition cases which accompanies the movie on the DVD does a much better job than the movie itself in addressing these issues.The cast represents considerable talent, and the acting is just fine. The problem is with the writing. This would've been a much better movie if it had focused on the rendition case itself; instead, that almost becomes a sideshow in the drama of the subplot involving the interrogator's daughter and her boyfriend. It is understandable that the writer felt the necessity to include a real terrorist plot alongside the extraordinary rendition and torture in order not to be accused of being completely one-sided, but this dilutes the impact of the rendition story. And in the end, the rendition plot is ""solved"" in a very unsophisticated manner.

Crane,"[1, 1]","After the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, several security measures were taken to protect the United States and its citizens.  Among them, Congress passed the Patriot Act which gave the US Government unprecedented powers to gather intelligence and pursue terrorists.  Rendition is the horrific story of what happens when the process nets an innocent person.The USG, whose policies oppose any form of torture in this country, sought other means to extract information.  Working with other countries whose policies did not ban torture and who were willing to accept these suspected terrorists, the USG sent such suspected terrorists to them.  In the process, there was no requirement for due process of law and an individual's rights.  Thus, a person could just simply disappear for years and nobody would notify family, friends or legal authorities.  The process is called ""extraordinary rendition"".The film raises fascinating questions about an individual's rights under such circumstances, vis a vis the safety and future security of our country.  Clearly, when an innocent person is caught in this web, we feel horrified, debased and ashamed.  But, there are always costs, and if a few individuals are mistakenly tortured when society at large is saved from the greater threat of thousands dying, is rendition an imperfect policy or  a necessary strategy to protect this country?The disc also contains a documentary called ""outlawed"" which chronicles the real life stories of two men from different parts of the world who underwent such experiences.The film is beautifully made in the United States and Morocco.  Meryl Streep is terrific as the US Government official ordering rendition, as is Omar Metwally, who plays the tortured individual.  However, Reese Witherspoon, normally an excellent actress, as the missing man's wife seems to equate being a zombie with acting, giving a very disappointing performance.  Jake Gyllenhaal is equally unimpressive as the US Government official assigned to represent the USG during the torture process.

1120666,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000YQAMZ8,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 10]","In this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of waterboarding, images of Abu Ghraib, or tales of forced detentions at Guantanamo Bay, Gavin Hood`s ""Rendition"" is about as up-to-the-minute and timely a movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream Hollywood.  It's not, by any stretch of the imagination, a perfect film, but neither does it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from all across the ideological and political spectrum.The term ""rendition"" refers to the ability of the CIA to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist dealings, then to whisk them away in secret to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time, all without due process of law.  Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the United States.  He has an American wife, a young son and a new baby on the way.  He seems a very  unlikely candidate for a terrorist, yet one day, without warning or explanation, Anwar is seized and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that Anwar claims to know nothing about.On the negative side, ""Rendition"" falters occasionally in its storytelling abilities, often biting off a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character.  The ostensible focal point is Douglas Freeman, a rookie CIA agent who is brought in to observe Anwar's ""interrogation"" at the hands of Egyptian officials.  The problem is that, as conceived by writer Kelley Sane and enacted by Jake Gyllenhaal, Freeman seems too much of a nave ""boy scout"" to make for a very plausible agent, and he isn't given the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character.  We know little about him at the beginning and even less, it seems, at the end.  He ""goes through the motions,"" but we learn precious little about the man within.  Thus, without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together, the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams, with story elements flying off in all directions.  A similar problem occurs with Anwar's distraught wife, played by Reese Witherspoon, a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface.  Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have both proven themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances, but here they are hemmed in by a restrictive screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances.What makes ""Rendition"" an ultimately powerful film, however, is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot lines elegantly dovetail into one another in the movie's closing stretches.  It may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject, but, hey, this is Hollywood after all,  and the film has to pay SOME deference to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green lighted, let alone see the light of day as a completed project.Two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film:  Omar Metwally who makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a real life Kafkaesque nightmare from which he cannot awaken, and Yigal Naor who makes a surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogator/torturer.  Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles.  Special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of Dion Beebe.Does the movie oversimplify the issues?  Probably.  Does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces?  Most definitely.  (One wonders how the movie would have played if Anwar really WERE a terrorist).  Yet, the movie has the guts to tread on controversial ground.  It isn't afraid to raise dicey questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political stances it takes.  It openly ponders the issue of just how DOES a nation hold fast to its hard-won principle of ""civil liberties for all"" in the face of terrorism and fear.  And just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say ""enough is enough,"" even at the risk of being branded terrorist-appeasing and unpatriotic by those in power?  (The movie also does not, in any way, deny the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism).Thus, to reject ""Rendition"" out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good.  ""Rendition"" may not be perfect, but it IS good, and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live.  And that alone makes it very much worth seeing.",4,flawed but important drama,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,4740,"['day', 'age', 'just', 'other', 'news', 'story', 'discussions', 'waterboarding', 'images', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'tales', 'forced', 'detentions', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 's', 'Rendition', 'about', 'up-to-the-minute', 'timely', 'movie', 'ever', 'likely', 'come', 'entertainment', 'mills', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'perfect', 'film', 'neither', 'merit', 'caterwauling', 'opprobrium', 'received', 'hands', 'critics', 'ideological', 'political', 'spectrum.The', 'term', 'rendition', 'refers', 'ability', 'CIA', 'arrest', 'individuals', 'terrorist', 'dealings', 'then', 'whisk', 'away', 'secret', 'foreign', 'country', 'interrogate', 'torture', 'indefinite', 'period', 'time', 'due', 'process', 'law', 'Anwar', 'El-Ibrahimi', 'Egyptian', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'twenty', 'years', 'United', 'States', 'American', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'new', 'baby', 'way', 'very', 'unlikely', 'candidate', 'terrorist', 'one', 'day', 'warning', 'explanation', 'Anwar', 'seized', 'taken', 'undisclosed', 'location', 'where', 'subjected', 'brutal', 'torture', 'involvement', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'Anwar', 'know', 'nothing', 'negative', 'side', 'Rendition', 'falters', 'occasionally', 'storytelling', 'abilities', 'often', 'biting', 'off', 'little', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'terms', 'plot', 'character', 'ostensible', 'focal', 'point', 'Douglas', 'Freeman', 'rookie', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'brought', 'observe', 'Anwar', 'interrogation', 'hands', 'Egyptian', 'officials', 'problem', 'conceived', 'writer', 'Kelley', 'Sane', 'enacted', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Freeman', 'too', 'much', 'nave', 'boy', 'scout', 'make', 'very', 'plausible', 'agent', ""n't"", 'given', 'screen', 'time', 'develop', 'fully', 'character', 'know', 'little', 'beginning', 'even', 'less', 'end', 'motions', 'learn', 'precious', 'little', 'man', 'Thus', 'strong', 'center', 'gravity', 'hold', 'together', 'film', 'occasionally', 'coming', 'apart', 'seams', 'story', 'elements', 'flying', 'off', 'directions', 'similar', 'problem', 'Anwar', 'distraught', 'wife', 'played', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'woman', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'much', 'apart', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'surface', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Witherspoon', 'have', 'proven', 'be', 'fine', 'actors', 'other', 'circumstances', 'here', 'are', 'hemmed', 'restrictive', 'screenplay', 'rarely', 'go', 'single', 'recurring', 'note', 'performances.What', 'Rendition', 'ultimately', 'powerful', 'film', 'however', 'extreme', 'seriousness', 'subject', 'matter', 'way', 'two', 'concurrently', 'running', 'plot', 'lines', 'elegantly', 'dovetail', 'one', 'movie', 'closing', 'stretches', 'may', 'make', 'slightly', 'more', 'contrived', 'story', 'perhaps', 'might', 'have', 'liked', 'subject', 'hey', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'pay', 'SOME', 'deference', 'mass', 'audience', 'expectations', 'get', 'green', 'lighted', 'let', 'alone', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'completed', 'project.Two', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'particularly', 'compelling', 'film', 'Omar', 'Metwally', 'who', 'palpable', 'terror', 'man', 'caught', 'real', 'life', 'Kafkaesque', 'nightmare', 'can', 'not', 'awaken', 'Yigal', 'Naor', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'complex', 'character', 'chief', 'interrogator/torturer', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'also', 'make', 'marks', 'smaller', 'roles', 'Special', 'mention', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'warm', 'richly', 'hued', 'cinematography', 'Dion', 'Beebe.Does', 'movie', 'issues', 'Probably', 'stack', 'deck', 'favor', 'torture', 'victim', 'evil', 'government', 'forces', 'Most', 'definitely', 'One', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'Anwar', 'really', 'terrorist', 'movie', 'guts', 'tread', 'controversial', 'ground', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'raise', 'dicey', 'questions', 'risk', 'disapproval', 'political', 'stances', 'openly', 'issue', 'just', 'how', 'nation', 'hold', 'fast', 'hard-won', 'principle', 'civil', 'liberties', 'face', 'terrorism', 'fear', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'courage', 'take', 'people', 'good', 'will', 'finally', 'stand', 'up', 'say', 'enough', 'enough', 'even', 'risk', 'being', 'branded', 'terrorist-appeasing', 'unpatriotic', 'power', 'movie', 'also', 'not', 'way', 'deny', 'reality', 'extreme', 'Islamic', 'terrorism', '.Thus', 'reject', 'Rendition', 'hand', 'would', 'be', 'allow', 'perfect', 'be', 'enemy', 'good', 'Rendition', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'IS', 'good', 'something', 'importance', 'say', 'world', 'now', 'live', 'alone', 'very', 'much', 'seeing']",N/A

Nelson,"[3, 5]","An Egyptian chemical engineer (Omar Metwally as El-Ibrahimi) flies home to his American wife and kid and is kidnapped by the CIA at the Washington, D.C. airport.  When nothing can be pinned on him, the CIA bigwig (played by Meryl Streep) resolves the problem thusly: ""Put him on the plane.""  He is flown to Egypt to be tortured, or, to use the bastardized English of the day, ""harshly interrogated.""  El-Ibrahimi is waterboarded, electrically shocked, and isolated in a hole in the wall.Meanwhile his wife Isabella, played by Reese Witherspoon, is frantically trying to find out what happened to her husband.  In a typically Hollywoodish series of coincidences the chief torturer's daughter is also unwittingly mixed up with a member of a local terrorist group, much of this subplot following a different timeline.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays CIA analyst Douglas Freeman, who is forced to be a case officer for the first time, in a torture case no less.  Sickened by the torture, he gradually comes to believe El-Ibrahimi is innocent, and later acts accordingly.The movie was better than I expected, given the media reviews I read.  It effectively captures the sense of confusion and fear such renditions must cause, not to mention the agony of the torture. (Some of the scenes are not for the faint of heart.)  You also feel the claustrophobia of being in the hands of people who ignore all the standard rights you may be accustomed to, such as habeas corpus.  No wonder the Magna Carta stressed that right.The movie is clearly favorable to the El-Ibrahimi character, but not entirely one-sided.  In one scene Streep and a Senator's aide (enlisted by Witherspoon) spar over the correctness of rendition in this case and others.  He asks Streep if he should send a copy of the Constitution to her; she asks if he wants a copy of the 9/11 Commission Report, and claims such renditions had already saved 7000 Londoners.  Admittedly, though, even Streep's defense seems to be made to further demonstrate the Bush administration's facile use of numbers.  Other than a small nuke or an implausibly sophisticated biological attack, killing that many people would be a tough task indeed for terrorists.  (Governments, on the other hand, routinely kill multiples of that number all the time.)This film works fairly well both as entertainment and as timely commentary, a bifecta not easily done.  To all but the most witless warmongers, it should introduce at least a faint misgiving that if nothing else, torturing people before finding out if they're guilty is evil.  I found myself wondering why America didn't condone torture in major wars against powerful enemies, and yet stooped so readily to the gutter to fight a minor enemy that poses no existential threat to us.",4,Render unto Caesar,1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,2759,"['Egyptian', 'chemical', 'engineer', 'Omar', 'Metwally', 'El-Ibrahimi', 'home', 'American', 'wife', 'kid', 'kidnapped', 'CIA', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'airport', 'When', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'pinned', 'CIA', 'bigwig', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'problem', 'thusly', 'Put', 'plane', 'flown', 'Egypt', 'be', 'tortured', 'use', 'bastardized', 'English', 'day', 'harshly', 'interrogated', 'El-Ibrahimi', 'waterboarded', 'electrically', 'shocked', 'isolated', 'hole', 'wall.Meanwhile', 'wife', 'Isabella', 'played', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'frantically', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'husband', 'typically', 'Hollywoodish', 'series', 'coincidences', 'chief', 'torturer', 'daughter', 'also', 'unwittingly', 'mixed', 'up', 'member', 'local', 'terrorist', 'group', 'much', 'subplot', 'following', 'different', 'timeline', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'Douglas', 'Freeman', 'who', 'forced', 'be', 'case', 'officer', 'first', 'time', 'torture', 'case', 'less', 'Sickened', 'torture', 'gradually', 'believe', 'El-Ibrahimi', 'innocent', 'later', 'accordingly.The', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'given', 'media', 'reviews', 'read', 'effectively', 'sense', 'confusion', 'fear', 'such', 'renditions', 'must', 'cause', 'not', 'mention', 'agony', 'torture', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'also', 'feel', 'claustrophobia', 'being', 'hands', 'people', 'who', 'ignore', 'standard', 'rights', 'may', 'be', 'accustomed', 'such', 'habeas', 'corpus', 'wonder', 'Magna', 'Carta', 'stressed', 'right.The', 'movie', 'clearly', 'favorable', 'El-Ibrahimi', 'character', 'not', 'entirely', 'one-sided', 'one', 'scene', 'Streep', 'Senator', 'aide', 'enlisted', 'Witherspoon', 'spar', 'correctness', 'rendition', 'case', 'others', 'Streep', 'should', 'send', 'copy', 'Constitution', 'copy', '9/11', 'Commission', 'Report', 'claims', 'such', 'renditions', 'had', 'already', 'saved', '7000', 'Londoners', 'Admittedly', 'even', 'Streep', 'defense', 'be', 'made', 'further', 'demonstrate', 'Bush', 'administration', 'facile', 'use', 'numbers', 'Other', 'small', 'nuke', 'implausibly', 'sophisticated', 'biological', 'attack', 'killing', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'tough', 'task', 'indeed', 'terrorists', 'Governments', 'other', 'hand', 'routinely', 'kill', 'multiples', 'number', 'time', 'film', 'fairly', 'well', 'entertainment', 'timely', 'commentary', 'bifecta', 'not', 'easily', 'done', 'most', 'witless', 'warmongers', 'should', 'introduce', 'least', 'faint', 'misgiving', 'nothing', 'else', 'torturing', 'people', 'finding', 'out', ""'re"", 'guilty', 'evil', 'found', 'wondering', 'why', 'America', 'did', ""n't"", 'condone', 'torture', 'major', 'wars', 'powerful', 'enemies', 'yet', 'stooped', 'so', 'readily', 'gutter', 'fight', 'minor', 'enemy', 'existential', 'threat']",N/A
1120669,A387BD735MI50R,B000YQAMZ8,R. Schultz,"[22, 24]","There's a lot on this DVD, almost all of it interesting and informative.The movie itself is a dramatization of a composite case in which a traveler with a Middle Eastern name and heritage gets flagged as having possible terrorist ties, is waylaid by US/coalition authorities, and is sent to an ""undisclosed location"" where he is subjected to brutal bouts of questioning and torture. All this happens because of what might have been a simple cell phone mix-up.However, to the movie's credit, while making a moving humanitarian appeal against such treatment, it does not foreclose on the possibility that this traveler might have some al-Qaida ties. The movie also tries to give at least some weight to our State Department's arguments for the necessity of extracting information by any means. Meryl Streep makes the Government case with chilling pragmatic efficiency.So this movie does recognize some of the complexities involved. It is not a simplistic good guys vs. bad guys screed. This becomes especially true as it interweaves the story of two young Middle Eastern lovers caught up in the inflamed politics of their fundamentalist culture.Then this DVD contains what is tantamount to a whole second feature film - this one a documentary outlining the cases of two men who actually were tortured at such top-secret compounds located in out-of-the-way places around the globe. These undisclosed locations actually exist and are the receiving points for suspects detained under the Rendition Act.Neither of the two men interviewed here are Americans. The testimony of the German National from a Middle Eastern background is especially poignant. He talks about how his life was derailed by the torture he endured after he was taken, hooded and humiliated, to one of these sites - on the flimsiest evidence of any terrorist involvement.Finally, the DVD comes with a particularly intelligent Director's commentary. It will be worth your while to watch the features again, with this commentary turned on. In the end, Director Hood calls his project ""a poetic lament.""

I am not sure how it was billed by marketing, but it is heartbreaking to see something of this caliber miss the radars just because its politics did not agree with your typical Hollywood audiences.It is a taut CIA procedural with a feast of acting, storytelling, music -- what's not to like? Don't expect a standard-issue ""suspense thriller"" as the story lays its cards well ahead of the game, but it carries its moral heft with a delightfully interlaced narrative. For the inquisitive or the blissfully ignorant, may I recommendGhost Planeby Stephen Grey, a journalist from The Sunday Times who had to leave his job to pursue an investigation into CIA's ""Extraordinary Rendition"" witness torture program. As such, the film merely makes a real practice more accessible by couching it in a story of perfectly believable people. The web of inter-relationships among its characters is real, and thought-provoking.The acting is top class. The going objection seems to be that Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon were under-utilized. I feel it is not absolutely necessary for every Hollywood film to have a pronounced hero-heroine routine with a vehicle for stardom, so I found Gyllenhaal's understated take on a burned-out CIA paper-pusher endearing. Witherspoon turns in an unassuming depiction of a regular wife whose husband has gone missing under strange circumstances. Meryl Streep is what only she can be: a stony bureaucratic bigwig who gives us a candid view of the dark political apparatus in Washington. But perhaps the most memorable character is played by a relatively unknown actor, Yigal Naor, as an officious jailer trying to herd his squirrels amidst the chaos of fervid causes.Long story short: ignore the naysayers and watch it.

There is also a sub plot (which ties in towards the end) about the police chief (who carries out the torture) who is targeted by an extremist group after he tortures their members. The story is shocking enough before you realise that things like this actually do occur. Gyllenhaal is good as the CIA agent (with a conscience) on the ground, Withersoon plays the distraught wife of the kidnapped man very well indeed, Streep is a chilling cold CIA boss and the actor who plays the police chief is also especially note worthy. This is an atmospheric film and whilst the story loses it way briefly in the middle, by the end it is all tied up and finishes in a satisfactory way.

Why? Because his phone records showed that he received cell-phone calls from Rashid Salimi, a well-known terror mastermind.Al-Ibrahimi has an American wife Isabella (Oscar-winner Reese Witherspoon), pregnant with their second children, and eagerly waiting for him back in their Chicago suburban home. Al-Ibrahimi is whisked away from the Dulles Airport in Washington DC for a CIA interrogation when William Dixon, a CIA official, is killed by a suicide bomber at a ""North African"" country - which suspiciously looks like Morocco. Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), a CIA analyst who's not fit for covert operations by his own admission, reluctantly steps in to fill the void left from Dixon.When Al-Ibrahimi does not 'fess up to knowing Rashid Salimi and when he also can't explain how he keeps receiving phone calls from Salimi, he's bundled up and sent back to the ""North African"" country for the kind of interrogation that would not be allowed under the US laws.What follows are revolting scenes of torture in a dark leaky dungeon while Isabella tries her best to retrieve her husband through her old flame Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard), now a high-ranking Senate staffer. But she hits a wall of silence since CIA chief Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) is adamant to ""pay the price"" and punish the killers of her subordinate. She is a force of nature who does not take any prisoners on the battle field.An important subplot involves the story of the ""Arab"" chief on intelligence Abasi Fawal (played with amazing authority by Yigal Naor), his daughter and the Arab kid who loves her but ends up as an anti-government suicide-bomber trying to kill Fawal, the father of his girlfriend.At the end Douglas Freeman manages to free Anwar Al-Ibrahimi from Fawal's dungeon and sends him back home to his wife, son, and mother. But damage is done both to him and to his wife's sense of what's right and what's wrong in pursuit of the U.S. national security interests.A thriller that forces us to meditate over a number of unpleasant realities that became a part of our lives in the post-9/11 world.

1120677,A2ZIDCYC0GWWKF,B000YQAMZ8,"Vladislav ""Tepes""","[1, 1]","""Extraordinary Rendition"" is a violation of Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (UNCAT), because suspects are taken to countries where torture during interrogation remains common, thus circumventing the protections the captives would enjoy in the United States or other nations who abide by the terms of UNCAT. Its legality remains highly controversial, as the United States outlaws the use of torture, and the U.S. Constitution guarantees due process. Rendered suspects are denied due process because they are arrested without charges, deprived of legal counsel, and illegally transferred to a third world country with the intent and purpose of facilitating torture and other interrogation measures which would be illegal in the USA.But the U.S. decided it needed a program under the Clinton Administration to ""debrief"" terrorist ""suspects,"" and this was born.This movie puts you as close to the blood and torture as you can get without getting the blood on you, just as it does the American C.I.A. agent played by Jake Gyllenhaat, running the interrogation. The whole point is no Americans are directly involved, that's why it happens in a foreign country-he is told not to even speak directly to the suspect but to voice his concerns through the local, that way the U.S. has complete deniability. There are so many twists and turns, plots within subplots you stay on the edge of your seat trying to figure out what comes next. Meanwhile Terrorism 101 is running unmitigated in the streets. I will not give the story away except to say the unthinkable is being directed from the highest level of the U.S. government; a cold blooded serpent played by Meryl Streep, which acts with complete impunity against anyone that is Arabic. I don't know who's the most vicious, Streep's character, or the man doing the actual torture. But strangely enough, a low level C.I.A. agent, finds he has a conscience, and has to decide whether his duty is to the agency he works for, or the ideal he believes in, called America.You will not be bored, you will not forget, and its happening right now.

1120679,A1JRUSI8U5B88I,B000YQAMZ8,WiltDurkey,"[5, 6]","I was pleasantly surprised by Rendition.  Sure, the film is political, and many will feel annoyed at the coverage.  But, when you think about it, the torture in the movie ""isn't that bad"".  In other words, if you buy Cheney's POV, then this is the least you could expect to happen - a bit of waterboarding.  Is it pleasant to watch?  No.  But then, again if you agree with Dick, it shouldn't matter much, should it?  Why raise a fuss?What I liked about the movie is that it didn't shirk at showing the arguments _for_ torture.  Merry Streep's much more convincing when she states ""we saved 7000 people with those kinds of methods, a few months back"" than her character inLions For Lambs.  Simple, to the point.And some of the Islamists are shown to be pretty ugly-minded folks as well, not much deserving of sympathy.The flip side?  Well, the torturee confesses to something he didn't do (wouldn't you, to make it stop?) and the suicide bomber is initially motivated by his own brother's death at the hands of the secret police.  The locale seems to be Morocco or Algeria, some Francophone place with heavy anti Islamic repression.So all in all Rendition does a good job of presenting the fairly complex moral context in which this type of torture is being used.  Too bad there is no real way to dress it up as an ethical choice, innit?  The Gestapo was famous for waterboarding, btw, so be careful which moral side you pick and remember that it costs, heavily, in public relations.  Remember also that, if torture really won wars, more countries would be doing it.Movie-wise, the end twist was neat.  But I could have done without the Reese Witherspoon pregnancy tearjerker.
