Which I grew up with up and am now an adult. But seeing the huge change with the movies makes me really upset. Young girls aren't learning anything from these movies.Even though Kelly Sheridan did voice Merliah, I was still horribly disappointed with how modern and hip they tried to make Barbie. The story was cute, but not the Barbie stories I know and love. The film had great animation as well.This was the last tolerable Barbie movie I have watched and not completely cringed throughout it.

1317763,A2CRIQOX1SYA3I,B0031REQJ0,C. Taylor,"[68, 71]","Our three and a half year old daughter wanted to see this movie after seeing a preview on the Nick Jr website.  The only other Barbie movie we have watched was the Nutcracker, and while it was a cute movie with beautiful ballet sequences, it had too many scary parts for her.  We watched A Mermaid's Tale tonight as a special treat after a particularly traumatic day involving blood testing for allergies.  I was pleasantly surprised in this movie.  The  animation is fantastic, beautiful and lifelike.  The characters are sweet.  And the story line (you must realize we are talking it's for small children who love Barbie and fantasy) is easy to follow and fun.  My daughter loved it.  The ""scary"" parts weren't too scary, some sharks, a few jelly fish, and the mean Queen.  And while she is mean, it's nothing like the Queen in Sleeping Beauty that can give very young children nightmares for weeks.  The movie's message is that it is okay to be different.  We are very particular about what we let our daughter watch.  She watches Max and Ruby, the Wonder Pets, The Berenstain Bears, Little Bear, Olivia and occasionally Maggie and the Ferocious Beast.  She has seen the Tinkerbell movies, but didn't enjoy the other Disney movies, as the bad guys are always too scary.  She doesn't see any network TV or commercials in general. She saw the commercial for this on the Nick Jr website, and only after we had watched it first.  My husband and I especially appreciated the fact that there weren't references to things she wouldn't understand, there weren't jokes thrown in for the adults only, and that is was sweet and simple with no violence, no name calling and nothing offensive.  I would gladly watch it again with her, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a parent who was looking for a sweet, fun movie for little girls who love pretend and make-believe and believe it's possible Mermaids are really out there in the ocean somewhere.",5,Sweet movie with good message,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,1946,"['three', 'half', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'seeing', 'preview', 'Nick', 'Jr', 'website', 'only', 'other', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'was', 'Nutcracker', 'was', 'cute', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'ballet', 'sequences', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'scary', 'parts', 'watched', 'A', 'Mermaid', 'Tale', 'tonight', 'special', 'treat', 'particularly', 'traumatic', 'day', 'involving', 'blood', 'testing', 'allergies', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'animation', 'fantastic', 'beautiful', 'lifelike', 'characters', 'are', 'sweet', 'story', 'line', 'must', 'realize', 'are', 'talking', 'small', 'children', 'who', 'love', 'Barbie', 'fantasy', 'easy', 'follow', 'fun', 'daughter', 'loved', 'scary', 'parts', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'scary', 'sharks', 'few', 'jelly', 'fish', 'mean', 'Queen', 'mean', 'nothing', 'Queen', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'can', 'give', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'nightmares', 'weeks', 'movie', 'message', 'okay', 'be', 'different', 'are', 'very', 'particular', 'what', 'let', 'daughter', 'watch', 'Max', 'Ruby', 'Wonder', 'Pets', 'Berenstain', 'Bears', 'Little', 'Bear', 'Olivia', 'occasionally', 'Maggie', 'Ferocious', 'Beast', 'seen', 'Tinkerbell', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'other', 'Disney', 'movies', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'always', 'too', 'scary', ""n't"", 'see', 'network', 'TV', 'commercials', 'general', 'saw', 'commercial', 'Nick', 'Jr', 'website', 'only', 'had', 'watched', 'first', 'husband', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'were', ""n't"", 'references', 'things', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'were', ""n't"", 'jokes', 'thrown', 'adults', 'only', 'was', 'sweet', 'simple', 'violence', 'name', 'calling', 'nothing', 'offensive', 'would', 'gladly', 'watch', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'parent', 'who', 'was', 'looking', 'sweet', 'fun', 'movie', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'love', 'pretend', 'make-believe', 'believe', 'possible', 'Mermaids', 'are', 'really', 'there', 'ocean', 'somewhere']",Barbie in A Mermaid Tale

1317773,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B0031REQJ0,Marshall Lord,"[1, 2]","Mattel's latest entertainment for little girls is a sort of cross between the Aussie teenage mermaid TV series ""H2O"" (Link:H20 Season 1 Volume 1) and the previous Barbie film ""Mermaidia, (Link: ""Barbie - Mermaidia [DVD]"") with a heroine who is a teenage surfing champion from Malibu.Each of the Barbie DVD's which Mattel has put out for little girls (and other members of the family) seems to have been more beautifully made than the last, charming, and, if my daughter is anything to go by, can hold the attention of a little girl for hours. ""Barbie in A Mermaid Tale"" has most of the usual Barbie elements: a brave, feisty heroine (althought she is a bit less irritatingly perfect than in most of the previous films), cute talking animals (in this case dolphins and fish), wicked villainess, the most tenuous link to reality, etc, etc ...The heroine, Merliah, has just turned 16: she has lived on Malibu with her hippie grandfather since an accident in which she was told that her parents died, and she is a fanatical surfer. At the start of the film Merliah is about to win a surfing championship when she is horrified to hear the announcer say that her hair has changed colour (which it has).If she thought that was strange, what happens next freaks her out: a dolphin called Zuma appears, tells Merliah that her mother isn't dead at all, but is the rightful Queen of Oceana, and asks her to travel under the sea to help restore her mother to her rightful place.At first Merliah think's she's losing her marbles, but Zuma convinces her that Oceana is real, and the adventure begins ...Along the way there are plenty of grown-up jokes to amuse adults watching this with their daughters - for example, a lot of fishy parodies taking the mick out of the world of celebrity, fashion, the media, etc.This DVD was given to my daughter as a ninth birthday present: I did wonder if she would be too old for it now, but she watched it several times and obviously enjoyed it.Before we first rented any of the Barbie videos for my little girl, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, over-sugary and over here. In general, however, I have been pleasantly surprised.Yes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccharine count, but the quality of that film and the other Barbie videos we have subsequently bought or rented, was significantly higher than I had originally expected before I saw the first one. They have kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - and introduced them to some beautiful stories. Several of them also introduced my children to great musical classics: others, of which this is one, had instead some enjoyable original or modern music. In all cases Mattel had hired first class international orchestras to provide the instrumental soundtrack.On more than one occasion I have been listening to a CD of a classic such as Beethoven's pastoral symphony (Beethoven: Symphony No.6), or ""The Queen of the Night's aria"" from Mozart's opera ""Mozart: The Magic Flute"", and my daughter, who was then five years old, recognised and expressed appreciation of the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. (""Barbie - The Magic Of Pegasus [DVD]"" and ""Mermaidia"" respectively.)The music for ""Barbie in a Mermaid Tale"" is easy on the ear, though this is not one of those Barbie films - there are some - which you would buy for the music.For reference, the Barbie films with beautiful musical scores taken largely from the classics include""Barbie of Swan Lake"" (with music from the ballet of that name)""Barbie in The Nutcracker"" (ditto)Barbie and the Magic Of Pegasus (Beethoven)Fairytopia II: Mermaidia (Mozart)""Barbie - In The 12 Dancing Princesses [DVD]"" (Mendelsohn)""Barbie - Barbie In A Christmas Carol [DVD] [2008]"" (various traditional carols)The two best with music which is original rather than taken from the classics, are ""Barbie - The Island Princess [DVD] [2007]"" and ""Barbie As The Princess And The Pauper [DVD]"" the music for which I can particularly recommend.In terms of production values, the DVD runs very smoothly and is fairly easy to navigate around: it even more visually beautiful than the previous Barbie fantasy films, which is quite a high standard, and contains a few extras such as simple games.Those people who enjoy criticising the way Mattel operate the Barbie franchise will not have much difficulty finding things in these films to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then these DVDs and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them.Ditto if your children are sensitive about body image issues - the female characters in this story are all impossibly thin.One charge which is sometimes made against the Barbie films but which does not hold water is the idea that they reinforce gender stereotypes. That criticism does not appear applicable to this particular film. There are few male characters: the heroine and central character is trying to rescue her mother, and willing to take great risks to do it, and does not appear particularly interested in boys, dates, or most of the other things teenage girls are stereotypically supposed to be obsessed with.To summarise, these films are beautifully made, and will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so. And there are enough more sophisticated jokes thrown in that you won't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch ""Barbie in aMermaid Tale"" with your offspring.",4,Malibu Barbie meets H2O

1317774,A3HREUZLLA6GY7,B0031REQJ0,Melanie Lane,"[35, 39]","I bought this the day it came out, and watched it with some of my younger little friends, ages 5-8. If I went by them, it'd be a 'Fish-A-Licious' 5 stars. However, I don't completely agree.The storyline is a bit of a twist on the same old Kingdom-owning-craze that Barbie movies have become infamous for. This time, evil in the form of Eris, the good queen's sister, reigns. Eris stole the throne from Calissa, and it's the good guys (er, girls) trying to restore peace and happiness. Merliah Summers is ex-Queen Calissa's daughter, and a champion surfer. When she 'comes of age' and discovers she's part mermaid, she dives into the sea to try and find the mother she's never known, help Calissa, and hopefully get back her 'normal' self.This one is decidedly more modern, the conversations are a little more mature, and yet some parts are even more juvenile. There is talk of Merliah's dad, who died in an accident, and Calissa's pregnacy and the oddity of mermaids marrying humans. None of it is overt or uncomfortable, but it's little changes like this that help balance out the more childish elements. Merliah acts like a brat, smarting off to her grandfather, being rude to Zuma and her friends, and talking a little too much about herself. However, in the the end, it turns out she's acting like this because she feels like a misfit and a freak. Her mother proceeds to tell her, ""You're unique. These differences don't make you bad, but special in your own way."" The animation isn't nearly as high quality as the others, but as far as I've seen, there haven't been any huge flaws. The underwater motions were well animated, and the surfing scenes were excellent. The music is modern and really fun. There are tons of cute mer-oriented words and catch phrases thrown in, such as ""Bloomingtail's"" ""Seaphora"" as well as songs like ""Swimmin' on Sunshine."" My biggest problem was the phsycic Destinies, whose faces go blank, eyes facant, and bodies glowing when they forsee the future. That, and the gleeful exclamtion of, ""You're Merliah's Spirit Guide!"" from Hadley left a bitter taste in my mouth, thinking, ""How am I gonna explain to these little girls that dabbling in spirit-fortune telling and phsycadelic glowing mermaids are wrong????""Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie. It was lots of fun, sweet, and bright colors. Cute, but not great. Enjoyable, but not one of the ones I'd watch over and over again. I would say ""Barbie's Worst!"" but that's a little too drastic. It's not too mature for girls to swallow, and yet it's got a little more 'salt' thrown in for older viewers. I wish, though, that Barbie would return to the more classic princess style of movies. The Three Musketeers was great, with a good storyline and plain, girl-power wholesome fun, where all the girls shone-not just Barbie. The upcoming movie, Barbie in a Fashion Fairytale, looks to be utterly ridiculous. Barbie looks awful, and the plot seems bland. ""Will Barbie and her dog Sequin find their inner Sparkle?!?"" Whoopee. Tell me this isn't the direction Barbie's moving in! Go back to classical music and princesses if that's what it takes, Barbie!",3,A Mermaid Tale: Fin-tastic or one big wipe-out?,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,3139,"['bought', 'day', 'came', 'out', 'watched', 'younger', 'little', 'friends', '5-8', 'went', ""'d"", 'be', ""'Fish-A-Licious"", '5', 'stars', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'completely', 'agree.The', 'storyline', 'bit', 'twist', 'same', 'old', 'Kingdom-owning-craze', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'have', 'become', 'infamous', 'time', 'evil', 'form', 'Eris', 'good', 'queen', 'sister', 'reigns', 'Eris', 'stole', 'throne', 'Calissa', 'good', 'guys', 'er', 'girls', 'trying', 'restore', 'peace', 'happiness', 'Merliah', 'Summers', 'ex-Queen', 'Calissa', 'daughter', 'champion', 'surfer', 'When', 'age', 'part', 'mermaid', 'sea', 'try', 'find', 'mother', 'never', 'known', 'help', 'Calissa', 'hopefully', 'get', 'back', ""'normal"", 'self.This', 'one', 'decidedly', 'more', 'modern', 'conversations', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'mature', 'yet', 'parts', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'juvenile', 'talk', 'Merliah', 'dad', 'who', 'died', 'accident', 'Calissa', 'pregnacy', 'oddity', 'mermaids', 'marrying', 'humans', 'None', 'overt', 'uncomfortable', 'little', 'changes', 'help', 'balance', 'out', 'more', 'childish', 'elements', 'Merliah', 'brat', 'smarting', 'off', 'grandfather', 'being', 'rude', 'Zuma', 'friends', 'talking', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'However', 'end', 'out', 'acting', 'misfit', 'freak', 'mother', 'proceeds', 'tell', ""'re"", 'unique', 'differences', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'special', 'own', 'way', 'animation', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'high', 'quality', 'others', 'as', 'far', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'huge', 'flaws', 'underwater', 'motions', 'were', 'well', 'animated', 'surfing', 'scenes', 'were', 'excellent', 'music', 'modern', 'really', 'fun', 'are', 'tons', 'cute', 'mer-oriented', 'words', 'catch', 'phrases', 'thrown', 'such', 'Bloomingtail', 'Seaphora', 'as', 'well', 'songs', 'Swimmin', 'Sunshine', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'phsycic', 'Destinies', 'go', 'blank', 'eyes', 'facant', 'bodies', 'glowing', 'when', 'forsee', 'future', 'gleeful', 'exclamtion', ""'re"", 'Merliah', 'Spirit', 'Guide', 'Hadley', 'left', 'bitter', 'taste', 'mouth', 'thinking', 'How', 'am', 'gon', 'explain', 'little', 'girls', 'dabbling', 'spirit-fortune', 'telling', 'phsycadelic', 'glowing', 'mermaids', 'are', 'wrong', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'lots', 'fun', 'sweet', 'bright', 'colors', 'Cute', 'not', 'great', 'Enjoyable', 'not', 'one', 'ones', ""'d"", 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'say', 'Barbie', 'Worst', 'little', 'too', 'drastic', 'not', 'too', 'mature', 'girls', 'swallow', 'yet', 'got', 'little', 'more', ""'salt"", 'thrown', 'older', 'viewers', 'wish', 'though', 'Barbie', 'would', 'return', 'more', 'classic', 'princess', 'style', 'movies', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'was', 'great', 'good', 'storyline', 'plain', 'girl-power', 'wholesome', 'fun', 'where', 'girls', 'shone-not', 'just', 'Barbie', 'upcoming', 'movie', 'Barbie', 'Fashion', 'Fairytale', 'be', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'Barbie', 'awful', 'plot', 'bland', 'Will', 'Barbie', 'dog', 'Sequin', 'find', 'inner', 'Sparkle', 'Whoopee', 'Tell', ""n't"", 'direction', 'Barbie', 'moving', 'Go', 'back', 'classical', 'music', 'princesses', 'what', 'Barbie']",Barbie in A Mermaid Tale
