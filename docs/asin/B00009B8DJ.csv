It is without a doubt, my favorite. Yuzuriha makes plans to meet with Kusanagi but instead runs into Satsuki. Satsuki attacks her and her Spirit Dog Inuki. Satsuki asks Yuzuriha one question: ""Why is it wrong to kill humans?"". When Yuzuriha fails to answer, she attacks Inuki. Yuto then answers her question by saying ""Because there would be people who would be sad."" I love this volume, it surpasses X Volume 3, which I thought was the best before I saw this. Buy it. You wont regret it, but you will regret it if you dont!",5,X Volume 6 Review,1058313600,"07 16, 2003",2003,666,"['volume', 'intense', 'battle', 'SUbaru', 'Seishiro', 'kick', 'off', 'volume', 'love', 'fighting', 'entire', 'episode', 'amazing', 'doubt', 'favorite', 'Yuzuriha', 'plans', 'meet', 'Kusanagi', 'instead', 'Satsuki', 'Satsuki', 'Spirit', 'Dog', 'Inuki', 'Satsuki', 'Yuzuriha', 'one', 'question', 'Why', 'wrong', 'kill', 'humans', 'When', 'Yuzuriha', 'answer', 'Inuki', 'Yuto', 'then', 'question', 'saying', 'would', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'sad', 'love', 'volume', 'X', 'Volume', '3', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'saw', 'Buy', 'wont', 'regret', 'will', 'regret', 'dont']",X - Six

Many anime fans have a film or series that really got them into it, and while I wouldn't consider myself an avid anime fan, X TV series has definitely gotten me hooked on anime.  It seems a lot of people are missing out on this truly special series.Chances are, if you're checking out X6, you're already a fan.  If you are looking to see what X is all about and to start getting into the series, which I strongly encourage, check out X1.  For the fans, X6 is more of the same greatness we've come to expect.  The ""cliffhanger"" from episode 15 is resolved, as is the relationship between Subaru and Seishiro, in an emotionally satisfying and (for me) unexpected way.  Episode 17 is mostly filler, reviewing what has happened with Kamui thus far in the series but also advancing his character a little.  Episode 18 is difficult for me to rate.  I find it hard to take a 13 year old girl seriously, so any episode focusing on Yuzuriha is a challenge for me.  But some thoughtful dialogue, some insight into the character of Kusanagi, another truly evil performance from Fuma-Kamui, and a ""new birth"" (the title of the episode I think) all help make this a meaningful episode.I love X, and I love this volume.  The only things keeping it at 4 stars instead of 5 are the fact that episode 17 was mostly a rehash of what has come before, my personal struggles taking Yuzuriha seriously (plus there were some hints of ephebophilia in there I found uncomfortable), and the lack of Sorata/Arashi story line (my personal favorite which I hope they take up in the next volume).  Any X fan following the series will not be disappointed with X6.",4,Why haven't more people reviewed this title?,1059350400,"07 28, 2003",2003,1729,"['do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'review', 'items', 'Amazon', 'think', 'lack', 'reviews', 'X6', 'ineXcusable', 'Many', 'anime', 'fans', 'have', 'film', 'series', 'really', 'got', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'avid', 'anime', 'fan', 'X', 'TV', 'series', 'definitely', 'gotten', 'hooked', 'anime', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'truly', 'special', 'series.Chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'checking', 'out', 'X6', ""'re"", 'already', 'fan', 'are', 'looking', 'see', 'what', 'X', 'about', 'start', 'getting', 'series', 'strongly', 'encourage', 'check', 'out', 'X1', 'fans', 'X6', 'more', 'same', 'greatness', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'cliffhanger', 'episode', '15', 'resolved', 'relationship', 'Subaru', 'Seishiro', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'unexpected', 'way', 'Episode', '17', 'mostly', 'filler', 'reviewing', 'what', 'happened', 'Kamui', 'thus', 'far', 'series', 'also', 'advancing', 'character', 'little', 'Episode', '18', 'difficult', 'rate', 'find', 'hard', 'take', '13', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'seriously', 'episode', 'focusing', 'Yuzuriha', 'challenge', 'thoughtful', 'dialogue', 'insight', 'character', 'Kusanagi', 'truly', 'evil', 'performance', 'Fuma-Kamui', 'new', 'birth', 'title', 'episode', 'think', 'help', 'make', 'meaningful', 'episode.I', 'love', 'X', 'love', 'volume', 'only', 'things', 'keeping', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'are', 'fact', 'episode', '17', 'was', 'mostly', 'rehash', 'what', 'come', 'personal', 'struggles', 'taking', 'Yuzuriha', 'seriously', 'were', 'hints', 'ephebophilia', 'found', 'uncomfortable', 'lack', 'Sorata/Arashi', 'story', 'line', 'personal', 'favorite', 'hope', 'take', 'up', 'next', 'volume', 'X', 'fan', 'following', 'series', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'X6']",X - Six

The battle is passionate and bloody. Will either man survive? Afterwards, Yuzuriha fights Satsuke, and in the process loses a dear friend. However, the cycle of rebirth is always present in our world, and someone is watching her back.This is an excellent series. It has action, drama, and suspense. The animation, plot, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent. There are also lots of great characters and plot twists. I try to be objective and think of just 1 bad thing to say about this series, but I can't. This is an all around incredible story. CLAMP has done it again!

After all, they are very much part of what anime is about.  But I let myself believe that I had the measure of this series.  Partially because the plot is a known quantity, based as it is on a very popular manga series.  In addition, the overall level has been so high that I didn't expect director Yoshiaki Kawajiri to notch up the intensity further until the final cataclysmic episodes.  Needless to say, I was wrong.'Slaughter' is the first real battle clash between the dragons.  This has been a while in coming while the writers have developed the characters in fine detail.  Subaru fights first with Fuma and then with Seishoro, who once killed the woman he loved.  First blood is spilled in a grim story that reveals much about the forces of destiny driving the story line.I expected the battles to continue from that point on, so my first surprise was to discover that the next episode, 'Wish,' was a deep dive into Kamui's doubt's and motivations.  A great reminder that he is not a simple player in a divine destiny but a human torn with anguish over the tragedies he has had to witness.  Now it is time to accept his role.But the real surprise of this set is 'Newborn,' which is a pure tour-de-force.  This time it is Yuzuriha and Inuku who are the protagonists opposed first by the cold, questioning Satsuki and then by Fuma.  This is a sure formula for a tragedy yet, somehow, this episode zags just when you expect it to zig in a fashion almost impossible to explain.  The result is a triumphs is a triumph for both the actors, the writers, and the artists.With three-fourths of this series over I've been musing at how much more compelling this version is than either the feature film or the manga.  In both of those cases the story frequently feels disjointed, particularly the film.  In this telling, even though the story line still jumps around, there is a sense of balance and flow that draws the viewer in deeper and deeper.  Perhaps this is because of the acting, or the director's knack for fleshing out the original's sketchiness, but it has complete changed my attitude toward the tale.This isn't a beginner's anime series - it isn't light sci-fi or romance, but it touches some of anime's deepest themes.  It is bound to become the kind of classic that should be on everyone's must see list.",5,Confrontation and Hope,1060905600,"08 15, 2003",2003,2407,"[""'m"", 'getting', 'point', 'watching', 'anime', 'where', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'surprised', 'surprises', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'what', 'anime', 'about', 'let', 'believe', 'had', 'measure', 'series', 'Partially', 'plot', 'known', 'quantity', 'based', 'very', 'popular', 'manga', 'series', 'addition', 'overall', 'level', 'been', 'so', 'high', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'director', 'Yoshiaki', 'Kawajiri', 'notch', 'up', 'intensity', 'further', 'final', 'cataclysmic', 'episodes', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'wrong', ""'Slaughter"", 'first', 'real', 'battle', 'clash', 'dragons', 'been', 'while', 'coming', 'writers', 'have', 'developed', 'characters', 'fine', 'detail', 'Subaru', 'fights', 'first', 'Fuma', 'then', 'Seishoro', 'who', 'once', 'killed', 'woman', 'loved', 'First', 'blood', 'spilled', 'grim', 'story', 'much', 'forces', 'destiny', 'driving', 'story', 'line.I', 'expected', 'battles', 'continue', 'point', 'first', 'surprise', 'was', 'discover', 'next', 'episode', ""'Wish"", 'was', 'deep', 'dive', 'Kamui', 'doubt', 'motivations', 'great', 'reminder', 'not', 'simple', 'player', 'divine', 'destiny', 'human', 'torn', 'anguish', 'tragedies', 'had', 'witness', 'Now', 'time', 'accept', 'role.But', 'real', 'surprise', 'set', ""'Newborn"", 'pure', 'tour-de-force', 'time', 'Yuzuriha', 'Inuku', 'who', 'are', 'protagonists', 'opposed', 'first', 'cold', 'questioning', 'Satsuki', 'then', 'Fuma', 'sure', 'formula', 'tragedy', 'yet', 'somehow', 'episode', 'just', 'when', 'expect', 'zig', 'fashion', 'almost', 'impossible', 'explain', 'result', 'triumphs', 'triumph', 'actors', 'writers', 'artists.With', 'three-fourths', 'series', ""'ve"", 'been', 'musing', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'version', 'feature', 'film', 'manga', 'cases', 'story', 'frequently', 'disjointed', 'particularly', 'film', 'telling', 'even', 'story', 'line', 'still', 'around', 'sense', 'balance', 'flow', 'viewer', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'Perhaps', 'acting', 'director', 'knack', 'fleshing', 'out', 'original', 'sketchiness', 'complete', 'changed', 'attitude', 'tale.This', ""n't"", 'beginner', 'anime', 'series', ""n't"", 'light', 'sci-fi', 'romance', 'anime', 'deepest', 'themes', 'bound', 'become', 'kind', 'classic', 'should', 'be', 'everyone', 'must', 'see', 'list']",X - Six

I found all the episodes riveting (even the second episode which is mostly a recap is interesting) , but it is the third episode that I loved most.  ""Newborn"" has a touching story and a wicked cameo by Fuma.  It also doesn't end the way you might think it will.  I find this series consistently excellent.  It's one of the best anime series in years and it's time that it gets the proper respect it deserves on Amazon.com.  It deserves all the high praise fans have heaped on it.
