1329270,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B0036WSW8G,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[3, 6]","I liked the first Nanny McPhee film the best.  It seemed to focus on the people and their issues and on resolving them.  Magic was part of it, but the magic of family was the important part of it.  It made fun of adulthood and of unrestrained childhood without seeming to go beyond the pale.  Furthermore the romance was delightfully comic, making Colin Firth, a former Mr. Darcy, a somewhat helpless and comic widower.With Nanny McPhee Returns the story seemed way too melodramatic and relied too heavily on special effects.  That Nanny is a witch is obvious and acceptable as it was before, but here there was so much magic that the story seemed to get lost until the very end.  I felt the film worked too hard and employed almost every time worn concept:  ""eat your green vegetables"" to a grown man who'd been a ward of Nanny in the past.  Not to mention that green vegetables, let alone cheese, during World War II would have been a welcome treat.The antics seemed intended more to lengthen the film than to enhance the story.  Children chasing escaped piglets seemed quite manic and amusing enough, that the piglets should also do 1930s swimming routines and acrobatics was a little much; in short it felt patronizing.  It was as though a group of adults sitting around a conference table tried to decide what would ""entertain"" children without really considering that children are people and they do get the point of things.More than anything I felt that these devices distracted from the true story, that of children sent away for adult reasons (insensitive parents facing divorce and a war), children faced with destitution by virtue of adult greed and circumstances (shortage of field workers due to a war and a wicked--and quite funny--uncle), children faced with the possible loss of a parent due to war, and most important, children learning to appreciate others, their actions, and their world view.  That magic should bring the lessons home is acceptable, especially in a children's story, but total nonsense seems egregious.",3,Liked the original better,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",2010,2039,"['liked', 'first', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'film', 'best', 'seemed', 'focus', 'people', 'issues', 'resolving', 'Magic', 'was', 'part', 'magic', 'family', 'was', 'important', 'part', 'made', 'fun', 'adulthood', 'unrestrained', 'childhood', 'seeming', 'go', 'pale', 'romance', 'was', 'delightfully', 'comic', 'making', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'former', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'somewhat', 'helpless', 'comic', 'widower.With', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'Returns', 'story', 'seemed', 'way', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'relied', 'too', 'heavily', 'special', 'effects', 'Nanny', 'witch', 'obvious', 'acceptable', 'was', 'here', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'magic', 'story', 'seemed', 'get', 'lost', 'very', 'end', 'felt', 'film', 'worked', 'too', 'hard', 'employed', 'almost', 'time', 'worn', 'concept', 'eat', 'green', 'vegetables', 'grown', 'man', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'ward', 'Nanny', 'past', 'Not', 'mention', 'green', 'vegetables', 'let', 'alone', 'cheese', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'treat.The', 'antics', 'seemed', 'intended', 'more', 'lengthen', 'film', 'enhance', 'story', 'Children', 'chasing', 'escaped', 'piglets', 'seemed', 'quite', 'manic', 'amusing', 'enough', 'piglets', 'should', 'also', 'do', '1930s', 'swimming', 'routines', 'acrobatics', 'was', 'little', 'much', 'short', 'felt', 'patronizing', 'was', 'group', 'adults', 'sitting', 'conference', 'table', 'tried', 'decide', 'what', 'would', 'entertain', 'children', 'really', 'considering', 'children', 'are', 'people', 'do', 'get', 'point', 'things.More', 'anything', 'felt', 'devices', 'distracted', 'true', 'story', 'children', 'sent', 'away', 'adult', 'reasons', 'insensitive', 'parents', 'facing', 'divorce', 'war', 'children', 'faced', 'destitution', 'virtue', 'adult', 'greed', 'circumstances', 'shortage', 'field', 'workers', 'due', 'war', 'wicked', 'quite', 'funny', 'uncle', 'children', 'faced', 'possible', 'loss', 'parent', 'due', 'war', 'most', 'important', 'children', 'learning', 'appreciate', 'others', 'actions', 'world', 'view', 'magic', 'should', 'bring', 'lessons', 'home', 'acceptable', 'especially', 'children', 'story', 'total', 'nonsense', 'egregious']",N/A

1329283,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0036WSW8G,Chris Pandolfi,"[38, 43]","There's something about the Nanny McPhee character that appeals to me even more than Mary Poppins. I grant you that Nanny McPhee is no looker, what with her hairy warts, her snaggletooth, and her bulbous nose all glaring at you as if she were an endurance test for her clients. All the same, she knows what she's doing. Perhaps it has something to do with her magic, which doesn't serve as a vehicle for light, whimsical musical numbers; it's harsher and more direct, the kind that could conceivably subdue unruly children were it real. Under her rules, it seems plausible that a child can actually learn his or her lesson, and indeed, all the children in this film are challenged in ways that many family films wouldn't care to consider. But it's not all strict policies and firm magical consequences - with each lesson the children learn, she gets progressively less ugly, and by the end, she looks like the Emma Thompson we know and love.""Nanny McPhee Returns,"" the sequel to the oddly charming 2005 film adapted from Christianna Brand's ""Nurse Matilda"" books, is not an equal to its predecessor; it surpasses it on just about every level, from setting to characterization to dialogue to theme, making for a film that's fun, thoughtful, and every so slightly creepy. It's not creepy in traditional, obvious ways, like you would expect from a brooding horror movie. It is, however, heightened to a state of strange otherworldliness, a place where audiences - children included - can actually see the humor in a pair of hitwomen threatening to remove a man's kidney's before deciding he should be stuffed like a dead bird. It's also a place where we feel genuine tension from the sight of children disarming a bomb that's only seconds away from detonating. In a normal universe, all this would be astoundingly inappropriate. Here, it's just right.The plot, which shifts the setting from the nineteenth century to the days of World War II, has Nanny McPhee (Thompson) entering the lives of the Green family, who manage a farm in the British countryside. The mother, Isabel (Maggie Gyllenhaal), is at her wits end. Her three children - Norman (Asa Butterfield), Megsie (Lil Woods), and Vincent (Oscar Steer) - are constantly fighting. Her husband is off fighting in the war. Her financial situation is steadily declining. She's continuously harassed by her good-for-nothing brother-in-law, Phil (Rhys Ifans), who has secretly gambled away the farm and is desperately trying to get her to sign away her half of the ownership. She tries to make ends meet by managing a village shop, but her associate, Mrs. Docherty (Maggie Smith), is just this side of loony, making it next to impossible to keep the shop in order. Worst of all, her children's rich, spoiled, snotty cousins - Cyril (Eros Vlahos) and Celia (Rosie Taylor-Ritson) - have been sent to stay on the farm.Nanny McPhee, with her trusty cane, can make magic happen with a bang on the floor, although not in conventional, innocent ways. To make the children stop fighting, for example, she forces them to hit, pull, and kick themselves individually, and she makes it clear that she will put an end to it only on the condition that they apologize to one another. They better hurry; more of the room is being destroyed, and letters from the Greens' father are liable to get thrown into the fire. Later on, when all five children have to work together to find a litter of prize piglets, Nanny McPhee intentionally makes it harder for them by having the pigs do what they normally cannot do, such as climb trees, jump long distances, and have them partake in a surprisingly entertaining display of synchronized swimming.With the notable exception of Uncle Phil, that rotten excuse of a man, every character develops in harmony with the story, which is to say we learn more about them as the film progresses. As a result, no one is a one-dimensional caricature. Cyril and Celia, for example, may have lived a privileged life, but that doesn't mean they're immune to emotional turmoil, mostly the result of parents who are more interested in themselves. If they act like brats, it's only because they know no other way to receive attention. Likewise, the Green children would like nothing more than for their father to come home; they're angry that he had to leave them and their mother alone, and since they're fairly isolated from the rest of the world, they have no one to take it out on except each other. Not a single child in this movie is bad. They merely have no healthy outlet for their pent up feelings.Hanging over the whole situation is the threat of enemy bombing, unlikely though it may be. Thompson, who also wrote the screenplay, somehow manages to take this unfortunate reality and lighten it up, not to the point of ridiculousness, but just enough for it to be engaging to a younger audience. I don't know how she managed that delicate balance between childish whimsy, maturity, and morbidity, but somehow or another, she did it. I was also impressed by her portrayal of Nanny McPhee, a no-nonsense but caring witch whose magic can make the best of any situation, no matter how desperate it may seem. ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" is a pure delight from beginning to end - charming, funny, touching, and intelligent, one of the best family films I've seen all year.",4,Every Little Thing She Does is

In addition to being one of our best actresses of the day, she is also a very fine writer and not at all afraid of jumping into 'family movies' that bundle fun as well as sage advice.  Her she has written and stars in NANNY MCPHEE RETURNS and lets hope this isn't her last visit.Nanny McPhee appears as a grotesquely ugly woman who arrives in households besotted with potential disasters and in the course of her manipulations of the microcosm that initiated the problems she has a sense of magic in reversing the behavior patterns of children and adults to bring about a happy ending to a crisis waiting to happen.  This trip finds her visiting the farm of Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal) whose husband (Ewan McGregor) is off at war, leaving the care of the three children and the farm and life in general in her hands.  Add to that the constant interference of Isabel's pestering brother-in-law (Rhys Ifans) and a battery of spoiled cousins and the madness of a misplaced bomb form the sky and Nanny has her hands full teaching the children not only how to cope but also how to behave in a manner that aids Isabel's survival.  Maggie Smith joins this irrepressible cast and in the end it is difficult to judge what entertains most - the madness or the glee.  Deep it is not, but it is one of those films you can slip into the telly and enjoy as much as an adult as the youngsters adore it. Fantasy, a bit of family drama, and a lot of fine lessons make this a fluffy movie nearly everyone can enjoy.

When you want me but no longer need me, then I have to go."" Except who would want to gaze at Nanny McPhee, perhaps the universe's ugliest deus ex machina? But there is implication to her homeliness, a meaning to her monobrow and hairy warts and snaggletooth.The story is set in rural England, somewhen in the early '40s. On a muddy, poo-ridden farmhouse, harried young mother Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal) struggles to raise her three boisterous children, with her husband gone off to fight in the big war. The tipping point arrives in the span of one day, in the shape of her very difficult niece and nephew come to stay on the farm while London is being bombed. Her kids and their cousins promptly commence a feud. As a cherry on top, in slinks her worthless brother-in-law (Rhys Ifans), waving his unwanted paperwork, trying to convince Mrs. Green to sell the farm, mostly so that he could pay off his gambling debts. The evening having gone all blustery and ominous, Mrs. Green, at her wits' end, responds to a knock on her door and glimpses on her doorstep the unsightly governess Nanny McPhee, there to impart five important lessons on the children. The lightning flashing in the background accentuates Nanny McPhee's gross unbecoming features. When Mrs. Green insists that she doesn't need help, Nanny McPhee states formally: ""I am an Army nanny, Mrs. Green. I have been... deployed."" In a wartime era, that's enough to sway a person.Emma Thompson writes the screenplay and demonstrates again that she's got her finger on the pulse of what makes a fantasy family picture work. NANNY MCPHEE RETURNS is enchanting and whimsical and quite funny. And, amidst the synchronized-swimming pigs and belching jackdaws and lady heavies and perhaps the most fun defusing of a bomb ever, we're treated to some very good dramatic beats which lend depth and ground the fable. If you've seen the first movie, Maggie Smith discloses a neat, unexpected bit of continuity near the end of the movie.Only tell me that Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhaal are sharing camera time, and it's enough to inform me of that film's quality. In the Maggie Gyllenhaal Can Do No Wrong Department, Maggie affects a pretty darn convincing English accent, and she's wonderful, as expected. You soon enough warm up to the alarming magical Nanny McPhee, especially as it's neat to see one of her facial flaws vanish each time the children learn a lesson. The children, who tend to make or break movies like this, are fairly terrific. That reprobate Uncle Phil, you won't recognize him as such, but actor Rhys Ifans is the same bloke who played Hugh Grant's odd flat mate in NOTTING HILL.

Snaggle toothed, dreadfully homely, and a wee bit of a woman that can cause even the bravest of souls to wince, McPhee is charming.  It always amazes me to watch such a beautiful actress as Emma Thompson play a character that is just so different from herself.Beauty aside, I find that Nanny is an endearing angel that rivals even the quintessentially beautiful Mary Poppins. Sans the musical notes that dance from Julie Andrews, Emma Thompson's character provides the sane sense of ease and comfort, while teaching a horde of little demons how to behave properly.I have to say that Emma Thompson delivers a perfect performance in this film. She's everything that a frazzled mother Mrs. Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal) could wish for, especially during the trying times of World War II. Ewan McGregor plays her husband, who is off fighting the war. As often occurred during those times, he has left his young wife behind to care for the homestead and their rapscallion brood of children Norman, Megsie and Vincent. As if times weren't trying enough, the situation becomes worse when their spoiled cousins come to stay with them, escaping the Blitz.While Mr. Green is away, his rotten brother Phil (Rhys Ifans) pressures Isabel to sell the farm to cover his own gambling debts. Five children, a frazzled mother on the brink of a nervous breakdown, and a horrid brother-in-law drives everyone to distraction.Thus, the WWII version of Nanny 911 arrives, intent on teaching the children five valuable lessons via her own form of entrancing magic. As Nanny McPhee demonstrated in her first film, hilarity abounds, as well as life lessons that benefit the children.Emma Thompson is magical, and her lessons to the children are filled with a patient wisdom we all could practice. My favorite part has always been the slight transformation that begins to overtake this dreadfully plain woman, making her the beauty that Thompson truly is.I have to give this a family film 4 star, for the simple charm and magic that can hold youngsters enraptured and keep adults smiling.",4,We could all use a Nanny like this,1283040000,"08 29, 2010",2010,2103,"['could', ""n't"", 'have', 'picked', 'better', 'movie', 'Snaggle', 'toothed', 'dreadfully', 'homely', 'wee', 'bit', 'woman', 'can', 'cause', 'even', 'bravest', 'souls', 'wince', 'McPhee', 'charming', 'always', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'play', 'character', 'just', 'so', 'different', 'herself.Beauty', 'aside', 'find', 'Nanny', 'endearing', 'angel', 'rivals', 'even', 'quintessentially', 'beautiful', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Sans', 'musical', 'notes', 'dance', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'character', 'sane', 'sense', 'ease', 'comfort', 'teaching', 'horde', 'little', 'demons', 'how', 'behave', 'properly.I', 'have', 'say', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'perfect', 'performance', 'film', 'everything', 'frazzled', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Isabel', 'Green', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'could', 'wish', 'especially', 'trying', 'times', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'husband', 'who', 'fighting', 'war', 'often', 'occurred', 'times', 'left', 'young', 'wife', 'care', 'homestead', 'rapscallion', 'brood', 'children', 'Norman', 'Megsie', 'Vincent', 'times', 'were', ""n't"", 'trying', 'enough', 'situation', 'worse', 'when', 'spoiled', 'cousins', 'come', 'stay', 'escaping', 'Blitz.While', 'Mr.', 'Green', 'away', 'rotten', 'brother', 'Phil', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'Isabel', 'sell', 'farm', 'cover', 'own', 'gambling', 'debts', 'Five', 'children', 'frazzled', 'mother', 'brink', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'horrid', 'brother-in-law', 'drives', 'everyone', 'distraction.Thus', 'WWII', 'version', 'Nanny', '911', 'arrives', 'intent', 'teaching', 'children', 'five', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'own', 'form', 'entrancing', 'magic', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'demonstrated', 'first', 'film', 'hilarity', 'abounds', 'as', 'well', 'life', 'lessons', 'benefit', 'children.Emma', 'Thompson', 'magical', 'lessons', 'children', 'are', 'filled', 'patient', 'wisdom', 'could', 'practice', 'favorite', 'part', 'always', 'been', 'slight', 'transformation', 'overtake', 'dreadfully', 'plain', 'woman', 'making', 'beauty', 'Thompson', 'truly', 'is.I', 'have', 'give', 'family', 'film', '4', 'star', 'simple', 'charm', 'magic', 'can', 'hold', 'youngsters', 'enraptured', 'keep', 'adults', 'smiling']",N/A

Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[0, 1]","It's great to see Nanny McPhee back, although quite why the UK title (Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang) was jettisoned for the pedestrian 'Nanny McPhee Returns', I'm not sure. However, the lady who talks softly but carries a big stick is as magical as ever.Moving the setting forward to World War Two creates a different ambience for the action, with a purple Rolls-Royce, a supercharged motorbike and an enemy bomber all contributing to the story. There are more computer graphics with this film, but they are so expertly done that it's often hard to see where reality ends and studio wizardry takes over. Do watch the excellent bonus features for some insights into how the special effects were produced.The acting is excellent, including Maggie Gyllenhaal as the harassed mother, Rhys Ifans as the villainous Uncle Phil, Ralph Fiennes in a cameo as Cyril and Celia's father and the inimitable Maggie Smith as the eccentric shopkeeper who has a little secret of her own. The children are also uniformly wonderful and the whole thing is held together by Emma Thompson as the lady with the lumps (with the assistance of Mr. Edelweiss).I've rated this movie as one star less than the first NM, mainly because there isn't the same sense of antagonism between the children and Nanny McPhee as there was in the first film. Their 'not wanting her', part of the reason for her being there, doesn't manifest itself very much and soon they are routinely calling on her for help. They also seem to be doing pretty well at learning her lessons on their own; at one point, she even remarks that things shouldn't be too easy and promptly gives them an entirely fresh, and magical, challenge. This lack of tension somewhat changes the dynamics of the movie and it becomes more the children and Nanny McPhee against the bad guys than Nanny McPhee teaching the children lessons about life.However, this isn't a movie which needs deep philosophical thought.

She is quite magical and quite delightful, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  (Of course, better to be a-head than a little behind, I always say.)The story begins on the family farm, in the English Countryside, far from London.  It is WWII.  Isabelle and the 3 children are taking care of the farm while the husband/father is away fighting in the war.  The farm is owned by the husband and his brother Phil.  The brother lives elsewhere.Phil wants the money from his half of the farm and is pestering the heck out of Isabelle to sell it but she is trying to hang on until her husband returns.  Meanwhile, Phil has incurred some gambling debts - actually, he bet the farm.  Two ""Hit Women"" are after Phil now, threatening to remove his kidneys.The 2 cousins are coming from the city (London) to stay at the farm because bombs are being dropped in big cities.

My daughter was NOT (for the most part) entertained by this film.  She did enjoy the pigs swimming, but other than that, it did little to keep her attention.  It was as if we were watching the first Nanny movie (which is fantastic) with just a quick change in cast and setting.  There was nothing new offered that we could see, unless the last 15 minutes were earth shattering, which I doubt.I also found it somewhat disturbing when Nanny is first introduced to the children that she uses violent tactics to get them to listen to her.  They grab their own hair and hit their heads against the wall or floor...and while I know it's Nanny's style to make kids do things they can't control, (like in the first movie when the kids were messing up the kitchen) this one had a meaner edge to it and I felt it was a bit overdone.Sorry I can't give you better news...save your money on this one.**Addition to Review made 6/14/11**I have had the opportunity to view the entire film recently and wanted to add to my review.I still believe that the scene where Nanny is first introduced to the children is a bit overdone.

Emma Thompson has done a truly magnificent piece of work with ""Nanny McPhee Returns.""  As much as I liked Nanny McPhee, this movie outstrips it.  Not only did Emma Thompson do a magnificent job writing the screenplay, but she was splendid again as the rather homely Nanny McPhee.When she first comes to the door you find yourself unconsciously asking yourself, ""Where did she park her broom?""  Nanny McPhee, at first, is a very homely, overweight woman with warts and a buck tooth that has to be seen to be believed.  Despite her appearance, she definitely projects an air of unquestionable authority, though at first the children do question it, as youngsters will do.  Slowly but surely she teaches them the lessons they need, assisted at times by a thump of her magical cane on the floor.InNanny McPhee Returns, there are three rather unruly children who are the despair of their mother, since their father has been called off to WWII.  To throw some pepper into the soup, their two cousins arrive from the city.  It is obvious from the get-go that the two cousins are spoiled brats, so you have a fair idea of just why Nanny McPhee shows up.  The five youngsters (obviously) do not get along at all, and in fact Nanny McPhee has to quite literally show them who's boss, which she does rather well.There is more of her magic, but unlike Mary Poppins there are no songs to carry the story along and, in truth, they are not needed.To add to the mother's problems, her smarmy brother-in-law is trying to get her to sell the farm.  There is an ulterior motive for his actions: he's in dept over his ears to a casino.  Worse, the casino owner has sent his ""Hit-men,"" actually two rather bloodthirsty women, to collect.An interesting tidbit is the jackdaw that hangs around Nanny McPhee and hold conversations with her.  The bird is forever belching because it has a habit of eating window putty.  This bird, and several other things, move the show right along.  I must add that Dame Maggie Smith (remember her as Prof. McGonnagal in ""Harry Potter""?) is absolutely delightful as the little old lady who runs the local store.  She (and several others) remember Nanny McPhee very kindly.  At the end of the film you find out why, but only if you saw the first film.All in all, this is a truly delightful film, in spite of a little over-the-top acting on the part of the brother-in-law and the two ladies(?).  If you liked the first Nanny McPhee, you are going to love this one, too.  I do highly recommend it, and I'm very glad I have it.",5,"All I Can Say is: ""WOW!""",1352246400,"11 7, 2012",2012,2608,"['be', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'see', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'done', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'piece', 'work', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'Returns', 'As', 'much', 'liked', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'movie', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'do', 'magnificent', 'job', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'was', 'splendid', 'again', 'rather', 'homely', 'Nanny', 'McPhee.When', 'first', 'door', 'find', 'unconsciously', 'asking', 'Where', 'did', 'park', 'broom', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'first', 'very', 'homely', 'overweight', 'woman', 'warts', 'buck', 'tooth', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'appearance', 'definitely', 'projects', 'air', 'unquestionable', 'authority', 'though', 'first', 'children', 'do', 'question', 'youngsters', 'will', 'do', 'Slowly', 'surely', 'lessons', 'need', 'assisted', 'times', 'thump', 'magical', 'cane', 'floor.InNanny', 'McPhee', 'Returns', 'are', 'three', 'rather', 'unruly', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'despair', 'mother', 'father', 'been', 'called', 'off', 'WWII', 'throw', 'pepper', 'soup', 'two', 'cousins', 'arrive', 'city', 'obvious', 'get-go', 'two', 'cousins', 'are', 'spoiled', 'brats', 'have', 'fair', 'idea', 'just', 'why', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'up', 'five', 'youngsters', 'obviously', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'fact', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'quite', 'literally', 'show', 'who', 'boss', 'rather', 'more', 'magic', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'are', 'songs', 'carry', 'story', 'truth', 'are', 'not', 'needed.To', 'add', 'mother', 'problems', 'smarmy', 'brother-in-law', 'trying', 'get', 'sell', 'farm', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'actions', 'dept', 'ears', 'casino', 'Worse', 'casino', 'owner', 'sent', 'Hit-men', 'actually', 'two', 'rather', 'bloodthirsty', 'women', 'collect.An', 'interesting', 'tidbit', 'jackdaw', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'hold', 'conversations', 'bird', 'forever', 'belching', 'habit', 'eating', 'window', 'putty', 'bird', 'several', 'other', 'things', 'move', 'show', 'right', 'along', 'must', 'add', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'remember', 'Prof.', 'McGonnagal', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'little', 'old', 'lady', 'who', 'local', 'store', 'several', 'others', 'remember', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'very', 'kindly', 'end', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'only', 'saw', 'first', 'film.All', 'truly', 'delightful', 'film', 'spite', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'part', 'brother-in-law', 'two', 'ladies', 'liked', 'first', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'one', 'too', 'do', 'highly', 'recommend', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'have']",N/A
