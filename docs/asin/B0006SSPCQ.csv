873901,A108AL4ECMBV9X,B0006SSPCQ,"Lorilynn ""Lori Cruz""","[0, 0]","I got this DVD collection and also Season 1 for my mom who absolutely loved the Commish.At the time she was very sick with end stage Pulmonary Fibrosis.  She passed away this past July.She had the chance to watch these DVD's over and over again giving her some very pleasurable, happy moments at a very sad time in her life.  The episode where Rachel has her baby and Cyd helps her is priceless.I would highly recommend this series to everyone.  However, just one note: If you have seen Michael Chiklis in his other series The Shield and are looking for a similar type show, you will be dissapointed because The Commish is very different.  He is the teddybear of police commissioners.  As his character puts it - he regulates human behavior.  He doesn't bully people and for the most part doesn't even lose his temper:)  I just love him.",5,I Love the Commish,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,837,"['got', 'DVD', 'collection', 'also', 'Season', '1', 'mom', 'who', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Commish.At', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'sick', 'end', 'stage', 'Pulmonary', 'Fibrosis', 'passed', 'away', 'past', 'July.She', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'DVD', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'giving', 'very', 'pleasurable', 'happy', 'moments', 'very', 'sad', 'time', 'life', 'episode', 'where', 'Rachel', 'baby', 'Cyd', 'priceless.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'everyone', 'However', 'just', 'one', 'note', 'have', 'seen', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'other', 'series', 'Shield', 'are', 'looking', 'similar', 'type', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'Commish', 'very', 'different', 'teddybear', 'police', 'commissioners', 'character', 'human', 'behavior', ""n't"", 'bully', 'people', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'even', 'lose', 'temper', 'just', 'love']",N/A
