Allen joins a group of exorcists that fight the Millennium Earl. The Millennium Earl is a demon who seeks to destroy the world by filling it with evil spirits. Allen Walker and his friends embark on a bloody battle to save innocent lives. D. Gray-Man is a very different series. The Gothic mixed with the supernatural creates a unique atmosphere. There are also lots of great characters, good and evil. Character development is the ""bread and butter"" of this anime. There are also many other awesome points: top notch animation, good soundtrack, and suspenseful action, as well as plenty of comic relief.

1529121,AFV2584U13XP3,B007BMIFL6,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[1, 3]",While the price of the series is reasonable it's also a little sad and annoying as we won't get to see the rest of the series as Funimation apparently has decided that the series is not financially worth continuing with.  Still the series is entertaining and exciting to watch as well getting more screen time with the endearing cast.  This actually has to be one of the few series that I felt the dubbed cast surpassed the subbed cast especially for the voice of Alan Walker.  The animation and soundtrack fit nicely and overall the season itself is worth getting regardless of the cancellation from Funimation for anymore of the series.  So if you have the first season I say complete your collection for the most part with this set to add to your anime collection....,5,Nice Addition For The First Season But Sadly We Don't See The Conclusion To This Seasons Finale,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,770,"['price', 'series', 'reasonable', 'also', 'little', 'sad', 'annoying', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'rest', 'series', 'Funimation', 'apparently', 'decided', 'series', 'not', 'financially', 'worth', 'continuing', 'Still', 'series', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'getting', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'endearing', 'cast', 'actually', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'series', 'felt', 'dubbed', 'cast', 'surpassed', 'subbed', 'cast', 'especially', 'voice', 'Alan', 'Walker', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'fit', 'nicely', 'overall', 'season', 'getting', 'regardless', 'cancellation', 'Funimation', 'anymore', 'series', 'have', 'first', 'season', 'say', 'complete', 'collection', 'most', 'part', 'set', 'add', 'anime', 'collection']",D.
