I began watching Grey's Anatomy from the pilot and love love loved season 1 and season 2 was great.Season 3 goes from bad to worse. Ellen Pompeo is probably the most annoying, lifeless person they could've picked to do the show. She just irritates me beyond belief. She can't act, and she always looks weird. Izzie used to be my favorite character but she started acting stupid and immature in season 3. George became more whiney. He married Callie (I do like her character but that was totally on a whim and seemed like a terrible idea). I still love Christina. I'm really over McDreamy, he's not that dreamy and he thinks he's all that when really he's just kind of blah.I've seen the commercials for season 4 and it just seems that they're going to re do the meredith-derek story with meredith's half sister. And without Dr. Burke in the story I really don't know if I'm going to watch the show.All in all season 3 just show cases the worst in the characters personalities, they all act more whiney, more immature, more catty.

I started watching Grey's during the first season and was hooked.  The second season was just as good.  But this third season, what did they do to us viewers?  I had a hard time watching it.  The writers, in my opinion were ruining the show.  However, when I bought this DVD collection that opinion changed a bit.  If you watch the DVDs they are as advertised, seriously extended and this was what I needed.  Also it helps to not see any commercials.  So this is a must for any Grey's Anatomy fan.  I still believe the show ""jumped the shark"" this past third season.  With Addison moving to a spin-off, Burke off the show and how the writers ""messed up"" George's character (would he really be with 2 women, much less cheat on his wife---that's not him) who could argue with me?

In television, sophisticated production and renowed actors may count, but no...that's not what makes a show unbeatable. The script, the story and the characters is what makes a winning show, and fortunately, Grey's Anatomy has this all in a very attractive way - the content, not the package, is what matters.Running through all episodes of this third season, no one of them are to be disregarded. With no exception, they all are worth our time, as surprises and new astounding happenings unfold in each one, but there is a trio which makes this third season very distinguishable: ""Walk On Water"" (15), ""Drowning on Dry Land"" (16) and ""Some Kind of Miracle"" (17), all of three focused on Meredith's attempt of suicide (which in fact was initially caused by an accident) and that makes, for the time being, the most powerful set of episodes of the series history. All three together could make a movie! For more spoilers, don't forget to visit the abc.com website for the complete episode description.

All of George's back-and-forth whining is annoying and makes me wish they had killed him off instead of writing Isaiah Washington off the series.George begins the season pretty affably, even likeable.  I enjoyed his courtship with Callie.  Then he became annoying when the family mess started and his dad died.  From uncharacteristically mouthiness with everyone around him, including Bailey, Burke, and even the Chief, to marrying Callie and cheating on her with Izzie.  My favorite storylines this season involved Meredith and her family (the death of her mother, the touch-and-go relationship with her father and step-mother), Christina's struggles with her relationship with Burke, and the random interactions between Bailey, Callie, Addison and Mark, Addison's almost triangle with Mark and Alex.After watching the early seasons of this series, I'm actually happy it's progressed the way it has.

1069173,AFFVUZEGP1FDQ,B000P6YNSO,"Morrigan Alexandros ""The Opinionated Me""","[59, 77]","Warning! Spoilers!I love Grey's Anatomy, I am completely addicted. I think Shonda Rhimes has created an amazing and enthralling show. But, this season I was not as drawn in as in the other two. I no longer raced to get home after class to watch the episodes; they just stayed on my Tivo for days.All the characters were on a downward spiral. Relationships were stretched to what could be a point of no return. Characters became needier, more damaged. Some characters shined. I loved Addison's character even more. We all hated Addison at the beginning of the second season. But, we grew to love her for her fighting spirit and for being so honest. I also love Callie. She is such a feisty Latina. She is strong, willful and so damn vulnerable in the area of love. (George, how dare you!) As a Hispanic, I appreciate that she was not typecast as a poor struggling Hispanic trying to make it through school to prove she has ""made it in America"". Instead, she is, as we recently learned, she grew up wealthy and George's part of the hotel ""rent"" was the tip she gave the hotel staff. That scene was very funny. I admire that Shonda Rhimes has refused to typecast minorities, or for that matter, the majority. As she so vividly portrays, race, religion or cultural background should have no place in love or career advancement. Burke and Christina made a phenomenal interracial couple and yet their race was never an impediment in their relationship. Rather, their lively competition and variety of quirks played an important role in how they carried their relationship.Some couples were formed and some were broken this season. I think that Addison and Alex were never given a real chance. They could have been a great and interesting couple. Izzie and George were pathetic (again, poor Callie). I do not like this pairing as a couple, they were great friends. I would like to see them end as a romantic relationship and try to move back to the friendship they used to have. I like Callie and I love the job Sara Ram&iacute;rez has done with the character of Callie. Callie is one of the few characters that have not become completely pathetic.Meredith entered an even more self destructive collision course with life. She does not feel that she is worthy of love. In her own words, she considers herself as ""damaged"". I feel for her. Her character has taken quite a beating. McDreamy leaves her in Season 2 for Addison, she feels her mom never loved her and her father was never a presence in her life. The only person who has truly tried to create a relationship with Meredith, that was not a total fiasco, was her step-mother. Meredith was finally able to start trusting and maybe even relying on someone. Yet, when she dies, her father blames and hits her. Meredith's spirit is just broken, no wonder she did not want to fight her way out of the freezing water. Can we blame her? Derek has not been as supportive as he should be; after all, he is at least partly responsible for the state she is in. The strong, slightly vulnerable but just as playful McDreamy was nowhere to be found. Thank God for McSteamy, just watching him was enough to make my day.George doesn't even know what he wants. He married Callie and then sleeps with Izzie. I hate this pairing. Burke? He just couldn't deal with being number 1 in Christina's life, with not being in her every thought.I hated the episode in which Addison went to CA, it was not good at all. I am a fan of Judging Amy, and I was looking forward to watching Amy Brenneman. Yet, this episode seems a little goofy, crazy and as if the writers had been reading Nietzsche while high on LSD. The characters were not engaging, their problems were not captivating and neither were their crazy personnas. Addison was acting in a way I had never seen her before. She seemed a little crazy, more out of control. Where was the assertive, yet vulnerable, Addison?The plots of several episodes seemed forced and overly dramaticized (they were grasping for a plot in the storyline after Meredith's drowning). The plots also seem hurried and were not allowed to develop. I suggest that they should spend a little more time writing and editing these episodes. The writers may say that the characters have a life of their own but the writers are holding the pen! So pull them in and give them something worth fighting and living for.",3,Not the best season,1187913600,"08 24, 2007",2007,4364,"['Warning', 'Spoilers', 'love', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'am', 'completely', 'addicted', 'think', 'Shonda', 'Rhimes', 'created', 'amazing', 'enthralling', 'show', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'drawn', 'other', 'two', 'no', 'longer', 'raced', 'get', 'home', 'class', 'watch', 'episodes', 'just', 'stayed', 'Tivo', 'days.All', 'characters', 'were', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Relationships', 'were', 'stretched', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'point', 'return', 'Characters', 'became', 'needier', 'more', 'damaged', 'characters', 'shined', 'loved', 'Addison', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'hated', 'Addison', 'beginning', 'second', 'season', 'grew', 'love', 'fighting', 'spirit', 'being', 'so', 'honest', 'also', 'love', 'Callie', 'such', 'feisty', 'Latina', 'strong', 'willful', 'so', 'damn', 'vulnerable', 'area', 'love', 'George', 'how', 'dare', 'Hispanic', 'appreciate', 'was', 'not', 'typecast', 'poor', 'struggling', 'Hispanic', 'trying', 'make', 'school', 'prove', 'made', 'America', 'Instead', 'recently', 'learned', 'grew', 'up', 'wealthy', 'George', 'part', 'hotel', 'rent', 'was', 'tip', 'gave', 'hotel', 'staff', 'scene', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'admire', 'Shonda', 'Rhimes', 'refused', 'typecast', 'minorities', 'matter', 'majority', 'so', 'vividly', 'race', 'religion', 'cultural', 'background', 'should', 'have', 'place', 'love', 'career', 'advancement', 'Burke', 'Christina', 'made', 'phenomenal', 'interracial', 'couple', 'yet', 'race', 'was', 'never', 'impediment', 'relationship', 'Rather', 'lively', 'competition', 'variety', 'quirks', 'played', 'important', 'role', 'how', 'carried', 'relationship.Some', 'couples', 'were', 'formed', 'were', 'broken', 'season', 'think', 'Addison', 'Alex', 'were', 'never', 'given', 'real', 'chance', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'interesting', 'couple', 'Izzie', 'George', 'were', 'pathetic', 'again', 'poor', 'Callie', 'do', 'not', 'pairing', 'couple', 'were', 'great', 'friends', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'end', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'try', 'move', 'back', 'friendship', 'used', 'have', 'like', 'Callie', 'love', 'job', 'Sara', 'Ram', 'iacute', 'rez', 'done', 'character', 'Callie', 'Callie', 'one', 'few', 'characters', 'have', 'not', 'become', 'completely', 'pathetic.Meredith', 'entered', 'even', 'more', 'self', 'destructive', 'collision', 'course', 'life', 'not', 'feel', 'worthy', 'love', 'own', 'words', 'damaged', 'feel', 'character', 'taken', 'quite', 'beating', 'McDreamy', 'Season', '2', 'Addison', 'mom', 'never', 'loved', 'father', 'was', 'never', 'presence', 'life', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'truly', 'tried', 'create', 'relationship', 'Meredith', 'was', 'not', 'total', 'fiasco', 'was', 'step-mother', 'Meredith', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'start', 'trusting', 'maybe', 'even', 'relying', 'someone', 'when', 'father', 'blames', 'Meredith', 'spirit', 'just', 'broken', 'wonder', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'fight', 'way', 'freezing', 'water', 'Can', 'blame', 'Derek', 'not', 'been', 'as', 'supportive', 'should', 'be', 'least', 'partly', 'responsible', 'state', 'strong', 'slightly', 'vulnerable', 'just', 'playful', 'McDreamy', 'was', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Thank', 'God', 'McSteamy', 'just', 'watching', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'day.George', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'married', 'Callie', 'then', 'sleeps', 'Izzie', 'hate', 'pairing', 'Burke', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'deal', 'being', 'number', '1', 'Christina', 'life', 'not', 'being', 'thought.I', 'hated', 'episode', 'Addison', 'went', 'CA', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'am', 'fan', 'Judging', 'Amy', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'episode', 'little', 'goofy', 'crazy', 'writers', 'had', 'been', 'reading', 'Nietzsche', 'high', 'LSD', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'engaging', 'problems', 'were', 'not', 'captivating', 'were', 'crazy', 'personnas', 'Addison', 'was', 'acting', 'way', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'seemed', 'little', 'crazy', 'more', 'control', 'Where', 'was', 'assertive', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'Addison', 'plots', 'several', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'forced', 'overly', 'dramaticized', 'were', 'grasping', 'plot', 'storyline', 'Meredith', 'drowning', 'plots', 'also', 'seem', 'hurried', 'were', 'not', 'allowed', 'develop', 'suggest', 'should', 'spend', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'writing', 'editing', 'episodes', 'writers', 'may', 'say', 'characters', 'have', 'life', 'own', 'writers', 'are', 'holding', 'pen', 'So', 'pull', 'give', 'something', 'worth', 'fighting', 'living']",Grey's Anatomy: Season 3

1069184,A1GSTCPM8NRZRV,B000P6YNSO,Sebastien Pharand,"[1, 2]","Yes, it's true that the third season of this medical drama didn't come close to achieving the highs of its second season. In fact, there are a few episodes in the third season I could have lived without. That said, Grey's Anatomy is still one of the best, most entertaining shows on tv.The season starts off well with our beloved characters trapped in their usual situations; the Meredith/McDreamy love triangle, Addison's troubles at finding love, George's troubles dealing with his newfound love interest (Kali) and with his father's illness, Christina's problems with her romance with Burke. The season starts off well and offers incredible moments(the episodes where George deals with his father's death are incredible). And of course you can expect great strange medical cases that will baffle our doctors. But am I the only one who is constantly annoyed with Izzie? Her character is winy, selfish and way to emotional. Her storyline never interested me in the least. Sure she was affected by her fiance's death. But after watching her mope and moan for nearly 5 episodes, I just wanted to slap some sense into her.Unfortunately, the show veers in the wrong direction halfway through the season. Meredith's near-death experience is laughable and unnecessary. She almost dies, then goes back to work the very next week? And what about the episode that also served as the pilot for Addison's new show? Her short stay in LA put a stop to things and stalled the show.It's a good thing the show redeems itself in its last three episodes. Christina's upcoming wedding and Meredith's dealing with her mother's death and troubled relationship with her father are what makes this show worth seeing.

First of all, after season 2's Denny and Lizzie's ordeal, it was really hard going through another tragedy with George's dad.I absolutely do not agree with this Izzie-George-Callie triangle.  It's just not credible.  Izzie is just too heartbroken to even think of George in this way.  I would advise the  writers to pull back on this one.I absolutely hate the Burke/Christina storyline.  I know they fired Washington (Burke), but they are losing a major character and an important element of the show.  From the stories that have come out, the guy was probably a jerk, and has anger problems, but with all the money ABC makes they could have paid for counseling, and should have kept him on for the sake of the show and the fans.  I  don't know how they are going to make up for his absence.  ABC, YOU SHOULD HAVE WORKED IT OUT.I hate that Montgomery-Shepard (McDreamy's ex) is leaving the show for a spinoff series.

1069193,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000P6YNSO,Tom Benton,"[15, 17]","*Possible spoilers within.*Oh, how the mighty have fallen.  Last week, the season premiere of ""C.S.I."" trumped the premiere of ""Grey's Anatomy""'s fourth season by a significant margin.  That's because ""Grey's Anatomy,"" a series which once shined so vibrantly, has been reduced to a dull glimmer.  Throughout the series' first two seasons, it seemed incredible that a show could maintain such a level of greatness and be so addictive without going off the tracks every once in a while.But come Season Three, the show did crash.  Big time.Truth be told, Season Three wasn't as bad as some will lead you to believe.  The first half of the season was uniformly great.  It wasn't until the midpoint, during an arc involving a ferry boat crash, that, ironically, the show crashed as well.  In a painfully obvious attempt to garner higher ratings, the writers decided to have Meredith ""die.""  Creator Shonda Rhimes is a big fan of Joss Whedon's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""; one can only surmise that Ms. Rhimes thought she could handle character deaths as gracefully as Whedon.  (She couldn't, but in her defense, not many can.)  Instead, Meredith's near-death experience - complete with visions of the afterlife, highlighted by the reappearance of Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the irresistible Denny Duquette - seems entirely unnecessary.  The actors' straight-faced performances during that storyline just makes the whole thing more hilarious.  Re-watching the episodes, it's apparent that the writers realized their mistakes after having made them, but were left with no choice but to make the best of them.  One would expect them to deal with whatever problems they've created and then keep moving on.  Instead, they took one enormous mis-step after another.  The biggest of these, perhaps even surpassing the idea to ""kill"" Meredith, was the decision to make Izzie (Katherine Heigl) sleep with George (T.R. Knight).  The result was the most unbearably grotesque ""romance"" of the year, an inconceivable concept made all the more nonsensical by the fact that, only a few episodes before, George had suddenly married Callie (Sara Ramirez).On top of the seemingly ceaseless crimes being committed by the writers, the second part of the season was overshadowed by the infamous conflict between leads Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey, in which Washington heatedly called T.R. Knight a homosexual slur.  The incident was blown way out of proportion by a bloodthirsty media, bringing Washington's slur to the forefront and trying to bury his repeated subsequent apologies, which they did quite well.  Unfortunately, Rhimes decided that this was worth dismissing Washington from the series, and so, in the uncharacteristically disappointing season finale, Burke just ups and leaves, during the middle of his wedding to Christina (Sandra Oh).  It was a terrible, terrible, incredibly foolish waste of one of the series' most interesting characters and most charismatic actors, and a perfectly wretched finish (hopefully) to a number of wretched mistakes.The season wasn't all bad, though.  The pre-ferry half was actually excellent.  The writers came up with typically fascinating developments and very amusing scenarios.  One could sense, however, that they were feeling the pressure of being the most-watched show on television after two phenomenal seasons.  There was noticeably more drama and less comedy.  Before deciding to pseudo-kill Meredith, the writers concocted a number of interesting twists, the majority revolving around Mark Sloan (the inimitable Eric Dane), who joined the regular cast at the start of the season.  That was an obvious and very smart move on the producers' part, because Dane added just the extra spark the season needed.  Sloan's presence resulted in some major (and delicious) character development for Alex Karev (Justin Chambers).  Karev had previously been the show's ""bad boy,"" but with Dane filling his shoes (and needing an even bigger pair), Karev gradually evolved into not just a decent guy, but a caring, honorable, and very likable one, though he held on to enough of his hard edge to remain Alex Karev.  Karev was also given two of the season's most interesting storylines: a brief and lighthearted romance with Addison (Kate Walsh), as well as the ""Jane Doe"" storyline, in which Karev discovers a pregnant woman deformed and amnesiac from the ferry crash.At the season's end, one is left exasperated, exhausted, frustrated, and bewildered, but not entirely unsatisfied.  As a whole, the season is evenly great and bad, but even when it's bad, ""Grey's Anatomy"" is better than most series.  The writers made a lot of mistakes toward the end of the season, and they'll have a hard time clearing them up during Season Four.  It's uncertain whether the series will ever be as stunning as it was during Seasons One and Two, but if one can look past the misguided writing in Season Three, it's clear that the show still has what it needs to be great.  Here's hoping the good doctors at Seattle Grace can put the show back together again.",4,The nefarious Meredith Grey,1191110400,"09 30, 2007",2007,5064,"['*Possible', 'spoilers', '*Oh', 'how',
