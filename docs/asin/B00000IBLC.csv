502233,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B00000IBLC,Get What We Give,"[10, 10]","I saw this gargantuanly funny play during its first run in Atlanta, before it made its way to Broadway and before the actors achieved their fame.  Joe Sears and Jaston Williams have definitely created one of the most hilarious shows ever to grace the boards.  This video is a lived filmed version of one of their shows.What makes this show funny is the characters and their believability.  Why should this be seen as unique and deserve such high praise?  Because all the characters in this play from Texas' third smallest town (Tuna, Texas) are played by two actors who manage to morph almost instantly into different costumes and personnas.  In short, you've got two quick change artists performing some of the most spot on real performances you'll ever see on stage or film.Sixteen characters are portrayed by these fine actors and some you will come to love and other you will lovingly hate.  The show tells the story of the a couple of days of the interwoven lives of the citizens of Tuna, Texas.  There's murder and intrigue, but it's all on the light side as we weave our way through this interesting world to discover who the murderer is.You have Dee Dee Snavely, Bertha Buemiller, Aunt Pearl Burriss, Stanley and Charlene Beumiller, Vera Carp, Reverend Spikes, Petey Fisk, not to mention a pack of dogs and more than one ""bitter pill"".  There's many many others that will have you rolling onto the floor off of your couch.The show was apparently lengthened after pre-Broadway run, though no one who didn't see that version will know.  If you're wise, you'll also check out the two other shows in the trilogy:  ""A Tuna Christmas"" and ""Red, White, and Tuna"".You'll laugh till you cry - I promise!",5,Get your Kleenex - cause you'll laugh so hard you'll cry!,1056931200,"06 30, 2003",2003,1702,"['saw', 'gargantuanly', 'funny', 'play', 'first', 'run', 'Atlanta', 'made', 'way', 'Broadway', 'actors', 'achieved', 'fame', 'Joe', 'Sears', 'Jaston', 'Williams', 'have', 'definitely', 'created', 'one', 'most', 'hilarious', 'shows', 'ever', 'grace', 'boards', 'video', 'lived', 'filmed', 'version', 'one', 'shows.What', 'show', 'characters', 'believability', 'Why', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'unique', 'deserve', 'such', 'high', 'praise', 'characters', 'play', 'Texas', 'third', 'smallest', 'town', 'Tuna', 'Texas', 'are', 'played', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'manage', 'morph', 'almost', 'instantly', 'different', 'costumes', 'personnas', 'short', ""'ve"", 'got', 'two', 'quick', 'change', 'artists', 'performing', 'most', 'spot', 'real', 'performances', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'stage', 'film.Sixteen', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'fine', 'actors', 'will', 'come', 'love', 'other', 'will', 'lovingly', 'hate', 'show', 'story', 'couple', 'days', 'interwoven', 'lives', 'citizens', 'Tuna', 'Texas', 'murder', 'intrigue', 'light', 'side', 'weave', 'way', 'interesting', 'world', 'discover', 'who', 'murderer', 'is.You', 'have', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'Snavely', 'Bertha', 'Buemiller', 'Aunt', 'Pearl', 'Burriss', 'Stanley', 'Charlene', 'Beumiller', 'Vera', 'Carp', 'Reverend', 'Spikes', 'Petey', 'Fisk', 'not', 'mention', 'pack', 'dogs', 'more', 'one', 'bitter', 'pill', 'many', 'many', 'others', 'will', 'have', 'rolling', 'floor', 'couch.The', 'show', 'was', 'apparently', 'lengthened', 'pre-Broadway', 'run', 'one', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'version', 'will', 'know', ""'re"", 'wise', ""'ll"", 'also', 'check', 'out', 'two', 'other', 'shows', 'trilogy', 'Tuna', 'Christmas', 'Red', 'White', 'Tuna', '.You', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'till', 'cry', 'promise']",Greater Tuna - The Comedy About Texas' Third Smallest Town

Dorsett ""Bill Dorsett""","[14, 15]","Sometime during the 80's, I stumbled into a theatre in Los Angeles where this show was playing and was completely won over by the citizens of Tuna, Texas.  Later there was an hour long version on HBO that I was lucky enough to tape and currently still resides in my dwindling VHS library.This version goes back to the much loved and still touring stage play ""Greater Tuna""  This is a filmed version of the classic stage play.  20 years later, it has lost none of it's hilarity.The entire population of Tuna Texas are portrayed by American Treasures Joe Sears and Jaston Williams. The Tuna trilogy- Greater Tuna, A Tuna Christmas and Red White and Tuna have a fierce and almost cultish following throughout the country.This is an excellent character study of the citizens of a small town in Texas, even though there is a murder mystery- the characters who reside in Tuna grab the spotlight and the performances by Mr Sears and Mr Williams are unforgettable, they deserve the long list of awards they have received for these plays.Even though the show pokes fun at small town life and Texans in particular, the shows are extremely popular in Texas, anyone who knows anyone from a small town will find something to identify with.I cannot recommend this highly enough. I love these shows so much that I would let the cast stay at my house when they are in town and I make my parents get a hotel room.Get that tour back to Seattle boys!
