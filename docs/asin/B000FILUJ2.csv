I give one more star though, because it's not as bad as other such shot on video movies.The acting is poor. The story, over-all is okay, but there's some major flaws logically... a young dude sees vampires attacking people in a car-park at night. He has to convince his friends, and the vampires want to stop them.There's the problem. These vampires feast so often, and in such public places that they're not going to remain 'unknown' for very long.Even when the vampires dump a body in the water, it floats. They see it floats, and just drive off! One might think that they'd at least weigh it down.The FX weren't that great, but I've seen worse. It's not as sexy a low-budget vampire film like ""Night Fangs"" or ""Dark Town"" (which have equally poor acting and script), which is why I gave it less stars than those films. It's not scary, either.Of some interest to trivia buffs, this has Todd Bridges from the 80s tv series ""Diff'rent Strokes""",2,Diff'rent Stakes,1153353600,"07 20, 2006",2006,1069,"['have', 'agree', 'other', 'reveiwer', 'was', 'done', 'people', 'who', 'seemed', 'bored', 'thought', 'make', 'horror', 'film', 'give', 'one', 'more', 'star', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'other', 'such', 'shot', 'video', 'movies.The', 'acting', 'poor', 'story', 'over-all', 'okay', 'major', 'flaws', 'logically', 'young', 'dude', 'vampires', 'attacking', 'people', 'car-park', 'night', 'convince', 'friends', 'vampires', 'want', 'stop', 'problem', 'vampires', 'feast', 'so', 'often', 'such', 'public', 'places', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'remain', ""'unknown"", 'very', 'long.Even', 'when', 'vampires', 'dump', 'body', 'water', 'see', 'just', 'drive', 'off', 'One', 'might', 'think', ""'d"", 'least', 'weigh', 'FX', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'not', 'sexy', 'low-budget', 'vampire', 'film', 'Night', 'Fangs', 'Dark', 'Town', 'have', 'equally', 'poor', 'acting', 'script', 'why', 'gave', 'less', 'stars', 'films', 'not', 'scary', 'either.Of', 'interest', 'trivia', 'buffs', 'Todd', 'Bridges', '80s', 'tv', 'series', ""Diff'rent"", 'Strokes']",The Damned
