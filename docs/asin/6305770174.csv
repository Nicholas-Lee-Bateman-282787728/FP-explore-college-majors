In only one scene does his mask slip, and it is truly  chilling.

477055,A1NPNGWBVD9AK3,6305770174,"Bruce Kendall ""BEK""","[19, 23]","Vann Seigert (Owen Wilson) has a little joke he shares with his friends: ""I was lying in the grass one time and this spider came along and crawled in my ear. It came out again and you know what it said?"" ""What"" ""Nobody home."" (big smile)That lame joke sums up Wilson's character: banal, empty, a cipher, a void, a nil, a negative number, ""a minus man."" So what is it about this character, who is in every scene in the movie, that makes him so intriguingly watchable? It is the creepy acknowledgment that it is just such a nondescript, seemingly harmless, even likeable person who can contain such a world of evil within. ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" ""Still waters run deep."" The movie also investigates the theme of ""the banality of evil,"" a topic that gained credence after the Nuremburg trials. Seemingly average people, with relatively benign upbringing and background, who are nevertheless capable of the most inhumane acts and who go about performing their atrocities in the most calm and matter-of-fact manner.Van Siegert is indeed the Angel of Death. His acts are more often than not entirely random. There is no prerequisite as far as the selection precess goes. If you happen to cross his path at a particular matrix in time, you will be amongst the chosen. Captain of the football team, heroin addict, a complete stranger in a diner. It could be you.Owen Wilson, with his boyish, broken nosed surfer looks and his goofy smile, is the perfect vehicle for this unforgettable character. The rest of the cast is splendid, but Brian Cox (the Albert Finney look-alike) is particularly adroit at pulling off a bravura turn as the manic-depressive head of the Durwin household that welcomes Siegert into their fold. This Emmy-winning actor should have been up for an Oscar for his work in this film.One of the really intriguing things about this movie is the fact that, according to the IMDB, it marks the directorial debut of Hampton Fancher, previously best known as the script writer for Blade Runner. The guy has obviously been around a while and knows how to set up a scene and how to get great performances out of a cast. A most impressive debut, indeed.For an offbeat, but highly rewarding viewing experience, give The Minus Man a go.BEK",5,The Void is Between the Ears,1056499200,"06 25, 2003",2003,2252,"['Vann', 'Seigert', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'little', 'joke', 'shares', 'friends', 'was', 'lying', 'grass', 'one', 'time', 'spider', 'came', 'along', 'crawled', 'ear', 'came', 'out', 'again', 'know', 'what', 'said', 'What', 'Nobody', 'home', 'big', 'smile', 'lame', 'joke', 'sums', 'Wilson', 'character', 'banal', 'empty', 'cipher', 'void', 'nil', 'negative', 'number', 'minus', 'man', 'what', 'character', 'who', 'scene', 'movie', 'so', 'intriguingly', 'watchable', 'creepy', 'acknowledgment', 'just', 'such', 'nondescript', 'seemingly', 'harmless', 'even', 'likeable', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'contain', 'such', 'world', 'evil', 'Do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'Still', 'waters', 'run', 'deep', 'movie', 'also', 'theme', 'banality', 'evil', 'topic', 'gained', 'credence', 'Nuremburg', 'trials', 'Seemingly', 'average', 'people', 'relatively', 'benign', 'upbringing', 'background', 'who', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'capable', 'most', 'inhumane', 'acts', 'who', 'go', 'performing', 'atrocities', 'most', 'calm', 'matter-of-fact', 'manner.Van', 'Siegert', 'indeed', 'Angel', 'Death', 'acts', 'are', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'entirely', 'random', 'prerequisite', 'as', 'far', 'selection', 'precess', 'happen', 'cross', 'path', 'particular', 'matrix', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'chosen', 'Captain', 'football', 'team', 'heroin', 'addict', 'complete', 'stranger', 'diner', 'could', 'be', 'you.Owen', 'Wilson', 'boyish', 'broken', 'nosed', 'surfer', 'looks', 'goofy', 'smile', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'rest', 'cast', 'splendid', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'look-alike', 'particularly', 'adroit', 'pulling', 'off', 'bravura', 'turn', 'manic-depressive', 'head', 'Durwin', 'household', 'Siegert', 'fold', 'Emmy-winning', 'actor', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'Oscar', 'work', 'film.One', 'really', 'intriguing', 'things', 'movie', 'fact', 'according', 'IMDB', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Hampton', 'Fancher', 'previously', 'best', 'known', 'script', 'writer', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'guy', 'obviously', 'been', 'while', 'how', 'set', 'up', 'scene', 'how', 'get', 'great', 'performances', 'cast', 'most', 'impressive', 'debut', 'indeed.For', 'offbeat', 'highly', 'rewarding', 'viewing', 'experience', 'give', 'Minus', 'Man', 'go.BEK']",N/A

Hormann,"[13, 13]","I must say that I had no idea what this movie would be like but found myself pleasantly surprised by both the story and the central perfomances.A young drifter by the name of Vann Siegert wanders into a small coastal town and slowly people in the town begin to disappear - it's no plot spoiler to say that Vann is the man causing these disappearances - we do see the movie through his eyes. He possesses a disarming charm and kindness that people feel they can trust him, most notably his landlord Doug followed by his wife Jane and his co-worker at the Post Office, Ferrin. Slowly things begin to change and tension builds as Vann ensures that his cover is not blown.While this probably doesn't sound too different from your average serial killer yarn, it is made more believable by spot on performances. Owen Wilson is a revelation as the drifter Vann, with the charm of a Tom Ripley, his drawling voice and easy smile, not once suggesting a killer behind it. Brian Cox and Mercedes Ruehl are both excellent as Vann's landlords, with Ruehl just topping Cox with a lovely understated performance not overshadowed by Cox's occasional histrionics. Finally, rounding out the main cast is Janene Garofolo, as Ferrin, and she nails her role as the co-worker who hopes for romance perfectly.The distraction of Vann's hallucinations don't work that well but this is a minor discrepancy in an otherwise excellent film.

477059,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6305770174,D. Litton,"[9, 13]","For those who like unconventional zest in their films, &quot;The Minus Man&quot; should make for an interesting cup of tea, depending on how far your patience will take you. The movie is careful not to journey down familiar territory, creating an atmosphere of dread and surreal intensity that manages to engage the audience by preparing them for a big event that never comes. Those put off by ambiguous endings should look elsewhere, but the sequence of events leading up to these loose ends is effectively creepy, and sometimes disturbing.The film begins by introducing us to Vann (Owen Wilson), traveling across the country in search of something never made clear even to him, much less to the viewer. As he drifts from one place to another, poisoning people with his tainted amaretto flask, he ponders his actions, his thoughts serving as narration throughout various points in the film. He is methodical rather than meticulous: there is no master plan to his crimes, just a simple acceleration of someone's downward spiral towards their not-too-distant end, like an angel of death making his next house call.What is most unsettling about this character is his sublime ability to keep mum about his actions; in reality, he is a kind and thoughtful man with a little business on the side to take care of every now and then. His arrival in a small town leads him to rent a room from Doug and Jane Durwin (Brian Cox and Mercedes Ruehl), who seem to be having problems with their marriage, possibly as a result of the absence of their daughter; the movie makes the mistake of not expanding on this tension.As Vann makes his way around town, picking up a job as a postal worker and making nice with the locals, he picks up where he left off before his arrival, silently claiming the lives of the town's star high school football player, a man aggravated by noisy children in the local hash joint, all the while getting deeper into the lives of his landlords and developing a friendship with coworker Ferrin (Janeane Garofalo).I must say that I was very impressed with this film's casting choices, and their favorable talent. Wilson, who is always a delight to watch despite the material, employs his natural charm and winning smile into the role of Vann, playing him as the all-around nice guy while also evoking a cold sense of doom in his hidden undertakings. Just as he so grandly masks his character's actions, Cox, Ruehl and Garofalo are equally impressive as those closest to him, playing their characters' obliviousness to Vann's true nature convincingly enough that the sense of unease is heightened even more.And if this weren't enough, director Hampton Fancher, who also adapted the novel on which the film is based, has a real knack for increasing the suspense at a rate that becomes almost unbearable. As things begin to fall apart for Vann, from the discovery of the poison in the bodies of three victims, to the foreboding presence of FBI officials in the area, the question of whether or not he will be revealed becomes much more intriguing.As with most films of this sort, this one steps wrong by leaving one of its two mysteries to the viewer's opinion, when it is better off solved. It involves the murder of Jane Durwin, with the suspicion pointing to Mr. Durwin; Doug seems to know just how the police will react to his alibi of going to the dentist on the day of the murder, fearing that police will conclude that he borrowed Vann's truck to follow his wife and do away with her. But was he responsible for her murder? The absence of their rumored quarreling, as well as Vann's presence, leaves this an open-ended case.The second mystery is the film's ending, which, again, leaves us no easy answers or standard thriller showdowns or comeuppances. In a way, this is as it should be; that the movie ends on a note of ambiguity provides for one final chord of tension, a sense of unease that may not be what we expected from the extreme buildup of suspense prior to the conclusion, but is nonetheless brooding. At one point, Vann makes the examination, &quot;I like the detail of a thing, especially if it has a purpose.&quot; &quot;The Minus Man&quot; may not have much purpose to it, but it's catchy, and effectively chilling.",4,"Effectively creepy, and sometimes disturbing.",1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,4246,"['who', 'like', 'unconventional', 'zest', 'films', 'quot', 'Minus', 'Man', 'quot', 'should', 'make', 'interesting', 'cup', 'tea', 'depending', 'how', 'far', 'patience', 'will', 'take', 'movie', 'careful', 'not', 'journey', 'down', 'familiar', 'territory', 'creating', 'atmosphere', 'dread', 'surreal', 'intensity', 'engage', 'audience', 'preparing', 'big', 'event', 'never', 'put', 'off', 'ambiguous', 'endings', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'sequence', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'sometimes', 'disturbing.The', 'film', 'begins', 'introducing', 'Vann', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'traveling', 'country', 'search', 'something', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'even', 'much', 'less', 'viewer', 'one', 'place', 'poisoning', 'people', 'tainted', 'amaretto', 'flask', 'actions', 'thoughts', 'serving', 'narration', 'various', 'points', 'film', 'methodical', 'rather', 'meticulous', 'master', 'plan', 'crimes', 'just', 'simple', 'acceleration', 'someone', 'downward', 'spiral', 'towards', 'not-too-distant', 'end', 'angel', 'death', 'making', 'next', 'house', 'call.What', 'most', 'unsettling', 'character', 'sublime', 'ability', 'keep', 'mum', 'actions', 'reality', 'kind', 'thoughtful', 'man', 'little', 'business', 'side', 'take', 'care', 'now', 'then', 'arrival', 'small', 'town', 'rent', 'room', 'Doug', 'Jane', 'Durwin', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Mercedes', 'Ruehl', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'problems', 'marriage', 'possibly', 'result', 'absence', 'daughter', 'movie', 'mistake', 'not', 'expanding', 'tension.As', 'Vann', 'way', 'town', 'picking', 'up', 'job', 'postal', 'worker', 'making', 'nice', 'locals', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'arrival', 'silently', 'claiming', 'lives', 'town', 'star', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'player', 'man', 'aggravated', 'noisy', 'children', 'local', 'hash', 'joint', 'while', 'getting', 'deeper', 'lives', 'landlords', 'developing', 'friendship', 'coworker', 'Ferrin', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', '.I', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'film', 'casting', 'choices', 'favorable', 'talent', 'Wilson', 'who', 'always', 'delight', 'watch', 'material', 'natural', 'charm', 'winning', 'smile', 'role', 'Vann', 'playing', 'all-around', 'nice', 'guy', 'also', 'evoking', 'cold', 'sense', 'doom', 'hidden', 'undertakings', 'Just', 'so', 'grandly', 'character', 'actions', 'Cox', 'Ruehl', 'Garofalo', 'are', 'equally', 'impressive', 'closest', 'playing', 'characters', 'obliviousness', 'Vann', 'true', 'nature', 'convincingly', 'enough', 'sense', 'unease', 'heightened', 'even', 'more.And', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'director', 'Hampton', 'Fancher', 'who', 'also', 'adapted', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'knack', 'increasing', 'suspense', 'rate', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'things', 'begin', 'fall', 'apart', 'Vann', 'discovery', 'poison', 'bodies', 'three', 'victims', 'foreboding', 'presence', 'FBI', 'officials', 'area', 'question', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'becomes', 'much', 'more', 'intriguing.As', 'most', 'films', 'sort', 'one', 'steps', 'wrong', 'leaving', 'one', 'two', 'mysteries', 'viewer', 'opinion', 'when', 'better', 'off', 'solved', 'murder', 'Jane', 'Durwin', 'suspicion', 'pointing', 'Mr.', 'Durwin', 'Doug', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'police', 'will', 'react', 'alibi', 'going', 'dentist', 'day', 'murder', 'fearing', 'police', 'will', 'conclude', 'borrowed', 'Vann', 'truck', 'follow', 'wife', 'do', 'away', 'was', 'responsible', 'murder', 'absence', 'rumored', 'quarreling', 'as', 'well', 'Vann', 'presence', 'open-ended', 'case.The', 'second', 'mystery', 'film', 'ending', 'again', 'easy', 'answers', 'standard', 'thriller', 'showdowns', 'comeuppances', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'movie', 'note', 'ambiguity', 'one', 'final', 'chord', 'tension', 'sense', 'unease', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'expected', 'extreme', 'buildup', 'suspense', 'prior', 'conclusion', 'nonetheless', 'brooding', 'one', 'point', 'Vann', 'examination', 'quot', 'like', 'detail', 'thing', 'especially', 'purpose.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Minus', 'Man', 'quot', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'purpose', 'catchy', 'effectively', 'chilling']",N/A

In other words, the ""story line"" is of secondary importance (my favorite example of such being ""Bullitt""). Wilson's laconic laid-back portrayal of a gypsy-like serial killer - the most difficult to catch, by the way - is spot on. This is noTexas Chainsaw Massacre style of movie, even the violence is dispensed with via a poison that just puts the victim to sleep (eternally).Beneath the calm demeanor, however, we are made privy to many of Vann's thoughts, which are as chilling in their sociopathic amorality as his exterior is bland.The story takes on a more quaint dimension when Vann (the protagonist) finds his way into a small coastal town, where he rents a room from a somewhat dysfunctional middle-aged couple.They, and his on-again off-again relationship with a girl working at the post office where he works, offer a degree of ""color"" to the film.

An engrossing indy film as any I've seen, we witness a seemingly harmless man, a man we find ourselves actually liking, kill off a handful of strangers without so much as a second thought. He is a serial killer, and his weapon of choice is poison. His activities are naturally alarming, and there is no explanation as to why he feels the intrinsic desire to kill certain people. He just kills them. No certain profile is needed. He kills business men and pretty doped-up women (Sheryl Crow). He wins them over with his innocence and strangely enough, it's not a contrived innocence. It's real. You get the impression that Wilson's character is truly just attempting to feel something, make something of his world that surrounds him with uneasy numbness.Halfway through the film, our Minus Man befriends a family who rents him a room. He witnesses their domestic disputes with childlike fascination, particularly concerning the disappearance of their college-aged daughter, who the family says left home to find her own way - but leaves the viewer thinking otherwise - and finds himself in jeopardy when the man of the household finally has enough with his wife and....Well, I don't want to spoil it. This is not an agenda film - like Monster - where you're supposed to empathize with the serial killer. It's merely a fictional story where we get to travel into the life of a man who's seemingly as normal and sincere as anyone we've ever known, with the beamy smile and courteous manner to boot, but deep down, has a desperate desire to kill at random. When he does kill, he doesn't seem to enjoy it very much. He just does it, unflinchingly does it.Not a gory film by any stretch, you never really see anyone die - just the heavy insinuations.

I thought the whole idea of  randomness(the killer deciding which way to go on the highway) was a good  idea, but they seem to shove it down your throat.

What  interested me about the film above the minor blemishes listed above(I only  mentioned a couple of these) was how it is hard not to like the killer.  There are many scenes where I found myself hoping that he hadn't killed a  person because I wanted to like him.  I found this impulse much more  frightning than if the character had been a real menacing guy who was easy  to hate.

Looney,"[3, 3]","Hampton Fancher has chose an unusual, laid-back angle in this slowly paced portrait of a serial killer -- from the very first scene, we are treated to some unusual views of ordinary objects, a hint of the mood of the story that follows.Rather than shoot this as a standard whodunit, Fancher lets us see the events through the eyes and the mind of his odd but likeable protagonist, Vann Siegert -- played with an almost distracted reserve by Owen Wilson.  We know from the very start that Vann is a killer -- in this case, a serial poisoner of strangers -- the suspense lies in wondering when or if he will take that one careless chance that allows the authorities to nail him.  The seemingly slightly simple-minded Vann is very adept at making others comfortable in his presence, at fitting into situations and engendering almost immediate trust among those with whom he interacts.  He rolls into town, finds an apartment, becomes gently friendly with his landlords (they even seem to feel protective of him), lands a job, impresses his boss and his co-workers -- and lights a spark of romantic interest in a fellow-employee, Ferrin, played with very realistic vulnerability by Janeane Garofalo.  There's something about Ferrin that makes her reach out to this man -- we can feel it, but it's never articulated.The thing that makes this film so terrifying is exactly this normalcy -- Vann could easily be your neighbor, the kid who mows your lawn...or the mailman.  It'll make you look at little closer at the people you think you know.The voice-over narration from Vann is very effective in letting the audience see his deeds from his own perspective, and in revealing how his mind works.  Far from coming across as an evil psychopath, he's almost a sympathetic character here -- he sees himself as helping the people he kills.Another effective device is that involving the two detectives who are 'on his case', interrogating him from time to time, trying to get him to crack.All in all, the film is well-written and skillfully directed, with some fine work by the cast.  It had to be tricky to handle this story in this way and still make it interesting, maintaining the vague tension that fills it.

The voice-over by Wilson's character gives you an idea that although he doesn't really seem to want to kill, and certainly doesn't want to kill violently, he still has the compulsion to kill.  In the film, he finally breaks his own rule about only killing strangers, but he does it believing that he is doing the victim a favor.

477080,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305770174,Reviewer,"[6, 6]","An unassuming, charismatic personality and a bottle of poison prove to be a lethal combination in ""The Minus Man,"" directed by Hampton Fancher and starring Owen Wilson.  When a personable young man drifts in from the Pacific Northwest and settles in a small coastal town, a number of people's lives are soon changed forever, and not for the better.  Vann Siegert (Wilson) is a likable fellow with a winning smile and always a credible story regarding who he is, where he's been and where he's going; he's also a psychotic killer who chooses his victims seemingly at random, yet is so ingratiating that he never falls under suspicion.  And such is the case when he rents a room from an unsuspecting couple, Jane and Doug Durwin (Mercedes Ruehl and Brian Cox).  Without realizing, of course, that he's enabling a murderer, Doug helps Vann find gainful employment, allowing him to establish himself within the community, and the rest-- as they say-- is history.  In one of the more telling scenes in the film, Vann reflects to himself, ""If it weren't for me, these people would all be doing something else today...""  What they are doing, in fact, is searching for one of their own who has gone missing, courtesy of Vann.  What is so distressing about this movie is the lack of menace outwardly presented by someone so intrinsically evil; like Norman Bates in ""Psycho,"" Vann is simply too unprepossessing and benign to be considered a threat to anyone.  The contrast between his countenance and his crimes is chilling; and the fact that he perpetrates his deeds in such a matter-of-fact, unemotional manner gives new meaning to the phrase ""cold blooded killer.""  One of the interesting aspects of the film is that Vann acts as narrator as well, which effectively puts the audience inside the mind behind the madness, even more so than in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" because in this case, the viewer is privy to the actual thought process that precipitates the crimes.  And it becomes a bit unnerving after some reflection upon what is actually transpiring under the guise of ""normalcy.""  Owen Wilson is well cast and gives a stunningly credible performance as Vann; he conveys such a low-keyed, eye-in-the-center-of-the-storm manner that he is instantly recognizable as the boy next door you'd be more than happy for your daughter to date.  And after watching him in action it becomes truly disconcerting to consider that in the real world there are those who look and act like Vann and are capable of such heinous acts of violence and deceit.  As the couple who takes Vann in-- and are subsequently taken in by him-- Ruehl and Cox capture the essence of the ""everyman/woman"" that can be found in any neighborhood in any town, and the fact that they are people with whom it is so easy to identify makes it even more upsetting when you realize that the vulnerability to which we are all prone can be exploited with such facility.  In a supporting role, Janeane Garofalo is a welcome presence as Ferrin, a co-worker of Vann's who is drawn in by his winsome facade; and rounding out the supporting cast are Sheryl Crowe (Caspar/Laurie), Dwight Yoakam (Blair), Dennis Haysbert (Graves) and Alex Warren (State Trooper).  Ultimately, ""The Minus Man"" is a cautionary tale that may spark a touch of paranoia in the viewer, and with good reason; and after spending some time with Vann, it just may alter your perception of some of your more casual acquaintances and even some old friends, especially those who seem so ""ordinary.""  It's a film that kind of sneaks up on you and takes you by surprise; and it may leave you pondering the darker side of human nature.",3,"Meet Norman's Brother, Vann",982540800,"02 19, 2001",2001,3646,"['unassuming', 'charismatic', 'personality', 'bottle', 'poison', 'prove', 'be', 'lethal', 'combination', 'Minus', 'Man', 'directed', 'Hampton', 'Fancher', 'starring', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'When', 'personable', 'young', 'man', 'drifts', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'settles', 'small', 'coastal', 'town', 'number', 'people', 'lives', 'are', 'soon', 'changed', 'forever', 'not', 'better', 'Vann', 'Siegert', 'Wilson', 'likable', 'fellow', 'winning', 'smile', 'always', 'credible', 'story', 'regarding', 'who', 'where', 'been', 'where', 'going', 'also', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'who', 'victims', 'seemingly', 'random', 'so', 'ingratiating', 'never', 'suspicion', 'such', 'case', 'when', 'room', 'unsuspecting', 'couple', 'Jane', 'Doug', 'Durwin', 'Mercedes', 'Ruehl', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'realizing', 'course', 'enabling', 'murderer', 'Doug', 'Vann', 'find', 'gainful', 'employment', 'allowing', 'establish', 'community', 'rest', 'say', 'history', 'one', 'more', 'telling', 'scenes', 'film', 'Vann', 'were', ""n't"", 'people', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'today', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'fact', 'searching', 'one', 'own', 'who', 'gone', 'missing', 'courtesy', 'Vann', 'What', 'so', 'distressing', 'movie', 'lack', 'menace', 'outwardly', 'presented', 'someone', 'so', 'intrinsically', 'evil', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'Psycho', 'Vann', 'simply', 'too', 'unprepossessing', 'benign', 'be', 'considered', 'threat', 'anyone', 'contrast', 'countenance', 'crimes', 'chilling', 'fact', 'deeds', 'such', 'matter-of-fact', 'unemotional', 'manner', 'new', 'meaning', 'phrase', 'cold', 'blooded', 'killer', 'One', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'film', 'Vann', 'as', 'narrator', 'well', 'effectively', 'audience', 'mind', 'madness', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'case', 'viewer', 'privy', 'actual', 'thought', 'process', 'crimes', 'bit', 'unnerving', 'reflection', 'what', 'actually', 'transpiring', 'guise', 'normalcy', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'well', 'cast', 'stunningly', 'credible', 'performance', 'Vann', 'low-keyed', 'eye-in-the-center-of-the-storm', 'manner', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'boy', 'next', 'door', ""'d"", 'be', 'more', 'happy', 'daughter', 'date', 'watching', 'action', 'truly', 'disconcerting', 'consider', 'real', 'world', 'are', 'who', 'look', 'act', 'Vann', 'are', 'capable', 'such', 'heinous', 'acts', 'violence', 'deceit', 'couple', 'who', 'Vann', 'are', 'subsequently', 'taken', 'Ruehl', 'Cox', 'capture', 'essence', 'everyman/woman', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'neighborhood', 'town', 'fact', 'are', 'people', 'whom', 'so', 'easy', 'identify', 'even', 'more', 'upsetting', 'when', 'realize', 'vulnerability', 'are', 'prone', 'can', 'be', 'exploited', 'such', 'facility', 'supporting', 'role', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'welcome', 'presence', 'Ferrin', 'co-worker', 'Vann', 'who', 'drawn', 'winsome', 'facade', 'rounding', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'Sheryl', 'Crowe', 'Caspar/Laurie', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'Blair', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'Graves', 'Alex', 'Warren', 'State', 'Trooper', 'Ultimately', 'Minus', 'Man', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'may', 'spark', 'touch', 'paranoia', 'viewer', 'good', 'reason', 'spending', 'time', 'Vann', 'just', 'may', 'alter', 'perception', 'more', 'casual', 'acquaintances', 'even', 'old', 'friends', 'especially', 'who', 'seem', 'so', 'ordinary', 'film', 'kind', 'sneaks', 'up', 'surprise', 'may', 'leave', 'pondering', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'nature']",N/A

He selects most of his subjects for their complaining about their lives and their desire to die  or that their lives are miserable (whether they mean it or not) as he travels from place to place. He settles in a small town and rents a room from Doug and Jane played by Brian Cox and Mercedes Ruehl after winning them over with his charm.  The trailer states that its his charm is that wins people over, but I found his odd demeanor more of as cause for concern than disarming. Part of the story is narrated by Wilson giving info on his subjects, himself and his eventual capture and what he will say to law enforcement and the greving families. I found the story to be refreshing and cleverly written, but underdeveloped for Wilson's character and what leads him to take the path of murdering the people he casually meets. He touches on the subject during one of his narrations, but only in a passing thought. He has a code or rule of conduct where he never gets violent with anyone and the poison he uses is fast acting and acts like a sleeping pill that you never wake from. He has other rules, but I don't want to give everything away. The production values are very good and include direction, acting, locations, cinematography, editing and to a slightly lesser degree the clever writing. I feel that 4 stars is just out of reach for this movie for Wilson's under developed character history and the at times uneven pacing of the story. This is by no means an action type of movie, so if thats what you are looking for you may want to try another movie for this one is somewhat slow paced.

Leaving the body in a roadside restroom, he continues into town.Once in town, Vann takes a room from the Durwins.  Doug Durwin (Brian Cox, the best Hannibal Lector from 'Manhunter') takes to Vann immediately, but Jane Durwin (Mercedes Ruel, The Fisher King) is cold at first.  Doug is quite fond of young HS football player Gene, and is deeply affected when Gene goes missing.  Gene is a victim of Vann's, though Vann broke two of his own rules.  (Don't give a drink to someone you know, and don't do anything in the town you live in)  Doug gets Vann a job at the local Post Office, where Vann meets Ferrin (Janeane Garofalo), who smokes and drinks, two things Vann doesn't do.  Vann and Ferrin hit it off anyway, and Vann settles into his new residence and new life.  But there are parts of his old life he won't give up, and the killing continues.'The Minus Man' is not a fast-paced thriller.  It's a casual stroll through Vann's life, narrated by him, revealing his personal thoughts on life, other people, and killing.  Vann suffers from fainting spells, in which two detectives from his past haunt him.  Det. Blair (Dwight Yoakam, who proved he could act in 'Sling Blade') and Det. Graves (Dennis Haysbert) appear in his subconscious, asking questions about his reason for killing.  Even Van himself is befuddled at some of his actions, and often uses humor instead of explanations in his answers.Owen Wilson always plays such a laid-back role (Meet The Parents, Zoolander, Shanghai Noon, Shanghai Knights, etc.) that it was a surprise to see him cast as a serial killer.  But the casual pace of the movie, combined with Vann's tranquil narration of his motives, is fully suited to Wilson's characteristic relaxed persona.  The acting is very good and the characters are interesting.  The plot is terrific and the twists surprising and inspired.  This is a great movie to rent or buy.

This is good because Minus Man puts a whole new perspective on killers and deranged people.Owen Wilson does a great job as the pleasant, all American drifter. Friendly, polite and genuinely absorbed by the world around him. Oh, and he's insane.Much of the film uses voice over for Vann's thought processes. He kills with the minimum cruelty needed. He has no interest in hurting others and thinks he is doing his victims a favor by removing them from life's burdens. He is at times as innocent as a child.Played out over several killings and inner conflict we see on screen Vann is loathsome and likeable at the same time. He is scary because he could be your friendly next door neighbor. He could have a freezer of trophies although Minus Man is not very violent. Instead it is meditative in it's narrative with good acting by Wilson.There is a bleak humor beneath the surface of Minus Man. All characters are exceptionally well acted with confident and laconic direction. Wilson is completely believable in this complex role.Minus Man is the kind of film you can watch several times and enjoy the nuiance of the performances, the simple and often prosaic situations that add to the tension of a well intentioned mass murderer. When will Vann be compelled to take a life, is he capable of sparing someone when his feelings get in the way?Some may feel the easy going pace doesnt fit the subject but to me that is what I most liked. The characters aren't given much to work with beyond Wilson so the interactions are interesting to watch.Most certainly a film deserving better than it's seeming banishment to cable hell.",5,Not Your Everyday Household Serial Killer,1047168000,"03 9, 2003",2003,1715,"['Minus', 'Man', 'genre', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'serial', 'killers', 'head', 'good', 'Minus', 'Man', 'whole', 'new', 'perspective', 'killers', 'deranged', 'people.Owen', 'Wilson', 'great', 'job', 'pleasant', 'American', 'drifter', 'Friendly', 'polite', 'genuinely', 'absorbed', 'world', 'Oh', 'insane.Much', 'film', 'voice', 'Vann', 'thought', 'minimum', 'cruelty', 'needed', 'interest', 'hurting', 'others', 'thinks', 'doing', 'victims', 'favor', 'removing', 'life', 'burdens', 'times', 'as', 'innocent', 'child.Played', 'out', 'several', 'killings', 'inner', 'conflict', 'see', 'screen', 'Vann', 'loathsome', 'likeable', 'same', 'time', 'scary', 'could', 'be', 'friendly', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'could', 'have', 'freezer', 'trophies', 'Minus', 'Man', 'not', 'very', 'violent', 'Instead', 'meditative', 'narrative', 'good', 'acting', 'Wilson.There', 'bleak', 'humor', 'surface', 'Minus', 'Man', 'characters', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'acted', 'confident', 'laconic', 'direction', 'Wilson', 'completely', 'believable', 'complex', 'role.Minus', 'Man', 'kind', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'enjoy', 'nuiance', 'performances', 'simple', 'often', 'prosaic', 'situations', 'add', 'tension', 'well', 'intentioned', 'mass', 'murderer', 'When', 'will', 'Vann', 'be', 'compelled', 'take', 'life', 'capable', 'sparing', 'someone', 'when', 'feelings', 'get', 'way', 'may', 'feel', 'easy', 'going', 'pace', 'doesnt', 'fit', 'subject', 'what', 'most', 'liked', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'work', 'Wilson', 'interactions', 'are', 'interesting', 'watch.Most', 'certainly', 'film', 'deserving', 'better', 'seeming', 'banishment', 'cable', 'hell']",N/A

He was getting rid of the competition so he could charm his way to another murder.

Wasn't the landlord seen taking a sip from a tainted bottle?"" *did he or didn't Vann get the landlord's wife--played by Reuhl? if so, how come he changed his M.O.? *what's was up with his supervisor drumming on that desk and why didn't dude just go home after work? *did you really, really see Vann slip any of the poisoned pixie dust in that guy in the diner's cup?*wouldn't you take Vann in for general all purpose weirdness if you were the two detectives in the car who asked Vann in for questions? *all of a sudden, Vann plays the piano and the ol' guy gets up and sings some ol' college fight tune or Irish gyspy tune or something--go figger.Yeah, you probably won't get a lot of great earthshaking insight from this one, but this is one for repeated viewings...which will allow me to come to this conclusion--was he or was he not a serial killer?
