1179335,A339D7WDJTQUN8,B001D5DQFC,"Carol Nichols ""Otaku moe!""","[6, 7]","I've heard of certain Funimation flops that do well in Japan and are well-recieved critically, but... are financially a flop because not enough people in the U.S. are aware, appreciative, or just flat-out care about this type of show.Kodocha (anagramical summaration for Kodomo-no-Omocha/a.k.a. A Child's Toy) is a story about a SUPER-hyperactive girl and her everyday life through life at it's highest and lowest moments.Sana is, by far, one of the most energetic anime heroines EVERRR! So energetic that the word: ""energetic"" probably can't even describe it!She is an aspiring child actor who is egoless as much as she is energetic, making her one of the VERY FEW hyper anime characters that's not annoying, but rather endearing.She has a quarrel with one of the bad apples, Akito, and tries to best him, and ends up helping him in a way that forever affects him... She treats it like it's no big deal, but for him... he can't express how grateful and happy he is to her.Sana thinks of Akito in a dual manner: One side of her thinks of him as a mortal enemy (and I say this in the most humorous of intentions), and the other side of her thinks of him as an eternal best friend.With this as the initial premise of the story, we go through life in the eyes of kids. Rarely sappy, always fun(ny), sometimes confusing, and emotionally affecting.(For spoiler reasons I've subtracted, to the best of my abilities, all of the details leading the events I've specified.)As for the product itself: It contains the first 6 DVDs of the original releases, spanning from eps 1-24, handling the first 2 story arcs, and adding a fun recap episode, and some great slice-of-lifers.The audio options are English 5.1, Stereo, and Japanese Stereo. You might think that a 5.1 seems unnecessary for this type of show, but believe me! IT IS A HUGE BONUS!Dubbing is handled by Funimation. Funimation is widely known for their adaptable reversioning on Dragon Ball Z, their legendary voice work for Fullmetal Alchemist, and for their super accurate adapation of the life affecting Mushi-Shi.Here we see more of an interpretation than an accurate dub effort. That doesn't mean, by a long shot, that it's on of their inferior works!Laura Bailey shows some of the best talents an English VA can do. Her fast paced speech is PERFECTION for Sana's character. COMPLETE PERFECTION!!! Need further proof? Watch the 1st episode!Jerry Jewell initially disturbed viewers with his low-pitched tone, that some thought was too deep to pass as a kid. If you continue though, you'll find that his voice connects quite... pleasingly... It's an (extremely fast) acquired taste, so no worries with that issue.Extra's include textless opener, interviews with the director, and commentaries with Collen Clinkenbeard, and Laura Bailey. The commentaries were especially interesting, since you see how much fun they had with the series, in both dubbing and in actually watching it!Kodocha is an overlooked anime that NEEDS much more attention than it already has.Buying this is a no-brainer, and, while it may seem like a Saturday morning cartoon, it has some of the best insights of child life that NO cartoon, American or Japan, has!",5,"Easily one of the best child romance, school life, and slice-of-life anime ever!!!",1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,3188,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'certain', 'Funimation', 'flops', 'do', 'well', 'Japan', 'are', 'well-recieved', 'critically', 'are', 'financially', 'flop', 'not', 'enough', 'people', 'U.S.', 'are', 'aware', 'appreciative', 'just', 'flat-out', 'care', 'type', 'show.Kodocha', 'anagramical', 'summaration', 'Kodomo-no-Omocha/a.k.a', 'A', 'Child', 'Toy', 'story', 'SUPER-hyperactive', 'girl', 'everyday', 'life', 'life', 'highest', 'lowest', 'moments.Sana', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'energetic', 'anime', 'heroines', 'EVERRR', 'So', 'energetic', 'word', 'energetic', 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'describe', 'aspiring', 'child', 'actor', 'who', 'egoless', 'as', 'much', 'energetic', 'making', 'one', 'VERY', 'FEW', 'hyper', 'anime', 'characters', 'not', 'annoying', 'rather', 'endearing.She', 'quarrel', 'one', 'bad', 'apples', 'Akito', 'tries', 'best', 'up', 'helping', 'way', 'forever', 'big', 'deal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'how', 'grateful', 'happy', 'her.Sana', 'thinks', 'Akito', 'dual', 'manner', 'One', 'side', 'thinks', 'mortal', 'enemy', 'say', 'most', 'humorous', 'intentions', 'other', 'side', 'thinks', 'eternal', 'best', 'friend.With', 'initial', 'premise', 'story', 'go', 'life', 'eyes', 'kids', 'Rarely', 'sappy', 'always', 'fun', 'ny', 'sometimes', 'confusing', 'emotionally', 'affecting', 'spoiler', 'reasons', ""'ve"", 'subtracted', 'best', 'abilities', 'details', 'leading', 'events', ""'ve"", 'specified', 'product', 'first', '6', 'DVDs', 'original', 'releases', 'spanning', 'eps', '1-24', 'handling', 'first', '2', 'story', 'arcs', 'adding', 'fun', 'recap', 'episode', 'great', 'slice-of-lifers.The', 'audio', 'options', 'are', 'English', '5.1', 'Stereo', 'Japanese', 'Stereo', 'might', 'think', '5.1', 'unnecessary', 'type', 'show', 'believe', 'IT', 'A', 'HUGE', 'BONUS', 'Dubbing', 'handled', 'Funimation', 'Funimation', 'widely', 'known', 'adaptable', 'reversioning', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'legendary', 'voice', 'work', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'super', 'accurate', 'adapation', 'life', 'affecting', 'Mushi-Shi.Here', 'see', 'more', 'interpretation', 'accurate', 'dub', 'effort', ""n't"", 'mean', 'long', 'shot', 'inferior', 'works', 'Laura', 'Bailey', 'best', 'talents', 'English', 'VA', 'can', 'do', 'fast', 'paced', 'speech', 'PERFECTION', 'Sana', 'character', 'COMPLETE', 'PERFECTION', 'Need', 'further', 'proof', 'Watch', '1st', 'episode', 'Jerry', 'Jewell', 'initially', 'disturbed', 'viewers', 'low-pitched', 'tone', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'deep', 'pass', 'kid', 'continue', ""'ll"", 'find', 'voice', 'connects', 'quite', 'pleasingly', 'extremely', 'fast', 'acquired', 'taste', 'worries', 'issue.Extra', 'include', 'textless', 'opener', 'interviews', 'director', 'commentaries', 'Collen', 'Clinkenbeard', 'Laura', 'Bailey', 'commentaries', 'were', 'especially', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'had', 'series', 'dubbing', 'actually', 'watching', 'Kodocha', 'overlooked', 'anime', 'much', 'more', 'attention', 'already', 'has.Buying', 'no-brainer', 'may', 'seem', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'best', 'insights', 'child', 'life', 'NO', 'cartoon', 'American', 'Japan']",Kodocha: Season 1

1179337,AMY5FH3WYKZQT,B001D5DQFC,"Lika Laruku ""likalaruku""","[0, 0]","It's an incredibly amusing story. Even people like me who generally avoid romance can enjoy this. Or perhaps there's just something generally less nauseating about preY2K romance comedies. This is the oldest example I know of trying to hook up a batshit crazy genki girl with a stone cold kuudere. The dub is excelent, but because of the switch from high-energy comedy to pure melodrama, Funimation dumped the series & you'll have to watch episodes 52-102 fansubbed.Sana is a well-meaning, high spirited girl, yet unwittingly dark & brutal....She absolutely loves doing good deeds & helping others, & even declares herself to be a pacifist when it comes to physical fighting, but indulges in stalking, bullying, blackmail, extortion, & seems to be unaware of just how sadistic she is. She's crazy-strong & is the 2ed scariest person in school. She has a short temper, has manic depressive mood swings, scares her friends & classmates, causes scenes in public at least once daily, & indulges in the occasional punch, kick, & weapon assault; but it's cartoon violence played off for laughs. She's also a hypocrite; she goes out of her way to end Akito's bullying of school students & teacher, & stops his own family from bullying him, but she does it BY bullying him. & even after he's fallen for her, she continues to trash talk him, tease him, & use him as her personal punching bag.There are of course lots of problems.....There are some random *BLAM episodes that contribute nothing to the stories, lengthy musical filler played ad nauseum in season 2, & recap episodes...That's a lot of filler, not to mention the fact that season 2 has a completely different genre & mood from season 1. There is a cultural goof in the New York arc of season 2, in which there is a female character named Secil. Not only was her name misspelled in english during character intro; it should actually spelled Cecil, which is a boy's name, & a very uncommon one in the United States at that; more common in Europe. The female equivalent is Cecilia. When Naozomi finds out she's his sister, he acts brokenhearted, despite him never showing any kind of romantic affection towards her, so the animators did a poor job of conveying romantic chemistry between them on his side.There are a couple of story arcs involving another adult Sana gets a crush on that is never brought up again after it happens, including Gojo not even begin brought up when Sana's infatuation with older men is discussed. Also the subplot of the Kurata family hotsprings is only brought up again once & left unresolved. Akito seems to be a minor character in the anime, as of half way through season 1, with Naozumi arguably having way more screen time. There's a metric ton of misunderstandings, unspoken feelings, & putting other people's happiness before their own that westerners like me frown upon as weakness & contrived. Sana & Akito are also a prime example of The Precarious Couple Effect & no matter how much they keep telling themselves that they like eachother, I'm just not seeing the chemistry between them.The effort they put into showing how compatible Sana & Akito are with other people was just more convincing while their desire to return to their first loves, like a hoarder unable to throw away garbage because it holds nostalgic sentiment. The coincidentally timed breakups with their new sweethearts is horribly contrived & everyone seems more interested in the happiness of the protagonists than with themselves, in fact their thoughts seem to revolve around either Akito or Sana like they had no lives of their own, not to mention that none of these characters act their age but think more like people in their late teens.Speaking of awkward chemistry, we also have Rei & Asako. I'd like to point out that Asako has minimal character development & not much personality. Despite being a nice guy with good intentions, Rei's an indecisive two-timer. After breaking up with Sana to date his ex girlfriend, & Sana started treating him like Zenjiro 2.0 because of it, Rei immediately turned around & became Sana's dedicated buttmonkey fanboy. His dreams & goals involve having both women in his life forever, unwilling to chose one over the other. When Asako dumps him for always putting Sana before her & forgetting his promise to move to London with her, he manages to sweet talk her into waiting for him & keeping a long distance relationship. Despite this, he drools over the girl who works at Grandma Kurata's sauna & Misako's ex husband's fiance.After the storyline stopped focusing on akward breakups based on stupid misunderstandings between Fuka & her crush, or Naozumi's sleezy & obnoxious new manager sabotaging the chemistry (& he disappears from the show entirely after this), Akito goes back to being absent from the show in a good deal of episodes, failing to show the audience exactly why he & Sana have any real chemistry with eachother. When he does show up after the breakup, their relationship is merely friendly, or he will find himself dragged into situations against his will or will be tagging along & not really contributing to the plot of the episode in any way.The relationship between Sana & Akito does not progress from this point. The anime series ends with a teacher trying to get Akito expelled (think Yu Yu Hakusho) & Akito & Sana almost dying trying to prevent a new friend from committing suicide. Before closing, Akito steals a kiss & Sana punches him. They tell eachother that they'll tell eachother their feelings ""next time."" Aside from the fact that they've told eachother their feelings many times only to act no different the next day, there is no next time. The Deep Clear one-shot manga was not adapted into animation & the anime diverts heavily from the manga, so the anime has an unresolved ending.",4,"Review is for both seasons, even though this boxed
