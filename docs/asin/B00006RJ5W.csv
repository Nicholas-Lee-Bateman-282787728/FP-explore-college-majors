722602,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00006RJ5W,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The Collector, 1965 filmA young office worker comes into sudden riches from a lottery. His hobby is collecting butterflies. He seems to have no family or friends. What is his primary desire? Will he capture a thing of beauty and keep it contained (like a butterfly)? The story rolls on. There isn't much dialogue here; you have to surmise the thinking from the action. He bought an isolated farmhouse where he has all the privacy he wants. The past is shown in monochrome. The captured girl ask &#34;why have you brought me here&#34;? He explains he wants a girlfriend, and why he chose her. The newspaper reports &#34;Art Student Missing&#34;. He says they will never find her. She asks to be released, but he does not agree. &#34;I can't let you go.&#34; Her cries for help go unanswered.Will he make a bargain with her? She wants to be freed soon, not in weeks. He wants her to know him. They bargain for a release date. She has her conditions&#34; fresh food and salad, air, &#34;things from a chemist&#34; [not a reference to drugs], etc. He fixed up the bath for her, but shoe must be tied up. [No facilities in her prison.] The girl gets her bath. [Notice her lips' movement does not match the words.] What if a visitor comes by. His neighbor for a visit and invites him over for a visit. The tub overflows! He has an explanation for the visiting neighbor. He shows off his collection of butterflies. [Is that a good investment?] &#34;How many have you killed?&#34; Does he want more than he can get? Does his collection show an interest in death? Or just power?They discuss a novel &#34;The Catcher in the Rye&#34;. [Is it really a great book?] Is it true to real life? Do Picasso pictures have value? [&#34;Truth and beauty are in the mind of the beholder.&#34;] Did he start an argument so he could go back on his promise? The girl has a new white dress for the evening meal. Champagne and caviar for their meal. Will he drive her all the way home? &#34;Please marry me.&#34; [Is that a realistic proposal?] She agrees! Does he believe her? &#34;I can do what I like.&#34; He does, in spite of her struggles. Does he want something he cannot possess? Does this relationship have a future?[You just wonder how it will end.] &#34;Look at me.&#34; He rejects her! She made an attempt to escape but failed. [Who does that landscape work?] But he still loves her. Does she need medical help? Too late? When a man mistrusts a woman he must lose her. Will he bargain with a new woman? No witnesses?This sick fantasy of a movie is based on a novel. Anyone who wins a lot of money from a lottery will get a lot of attention by the press. There is more privacy in a large city (Philadelphia, Cleveland) than in a small rural village. A man who holds a woman captive will have to provide for her needs (&#34;feminine products&#34;, etc.). This should attract attention in a small village. Would a lottery winner have no family or friends, unlike most real people? Note how often Samantha Eggar's voice was doubled (no synchronization of lip movements). I wonder why it was done? Was the purpose of this movie to show money can't buy happiness? [Maybe he doesn't know where to shop?] Wouldn't the police have done a better job in real life?",1,A Sick Fantasy,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,3238,"['Collector', '1965', 'filmA', 'young', 'office', 'worker', 'sudden', 'riches', 'lottery', 'hobby', 'collecting', 'butterflies', 'have', 'family', 'friends', 'What', 'primary', 'desire', 'Will', 'capture', 'thing', 'beauty', 'keep', 'contained', 'butterfly', 'story', 'rolls', ""n't"", 'much', 'dialogue', 'here', 'have', 'surmise', 'thinking', 'action', 'bought', 'isolated', 'farmhouse', 'where', 'privacy', 'past', 'shown', 'monochrome', 'captured', 'girl', 'ask', '34', 'why', 'have', 'brought', 'here', '34', 'girlfriend', 'why', 'chose', 'newspaper', '34', 'Art', 'Student', 'Missing', '34', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'be', 'released', 'not', 'agree', '34', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go.', '34', 'cries', 'help', 'go', 'make', 'bargain', 'be', 'freed', 'soon', 'not', 'weeks', 'know', 'bargain', 'release', 'date', 'conditions', '34', 'fresh', 'food', 'salad', 'air', '34', 'things', 'chemist', '34', '[', 'not', 'reference', 'drugs', ']', 'etc', 'fixed', 'up', 'bath', 'shoe', 'must', 'be', 'tied', 'up', '[', 'facilities', 'prison', ']', 'girl', 'bath', '[', 'Notice', 'lips', 'movement', 'not', 'match', 'words', ']', 'What', 'visitor', 'neighbor', 'visit', 'over', 'visit', 'tub', 'explanation', 'visiting', 'neighbor', 'collection', 'butterflies', '[', 'good', 'investment', ']', '34', 'How', 'many', 'have', 'killed', '34', 'Does', 'want', 'more', 'can', 'get', 'Does', 'collection', 'show', 'interest', 'death', 'just', 'power', 'discuss', 'novel', '34', 'Catcher', 'Rye', '34', '[', 'really', 'great', 'book', ']', 'true', 'real', 'life', 'Do', 'Picasso', 'pictures', 'have', 'value', '[', '34', 'Truth', 'beauty', 'are', 'mind', 'beholder.', '34', ']', 'Did', 'start', 'argument', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'promise', 'girl', 'new', 'white', 'dress', 'evening', 'meal', 'Champagne', 'caviar', 'meal', 'Will', 'drive', 'way', 'home', '34', 'Please', 'marry', 'me.', '34', '[', 'realistic', 'proposal', ']', 'believe', '34', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'like.', '34', 'spite', 'struggles', 'want', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'possess', 'Does', 'relationship', 'have', 'future', 'just', 'wonder', 'how', 'will', 'end', ']', '34', 'Look', 'me.', '34', 'made', 'attempt', 'escape', 'failed', '[', 'Who', 'landscape', 'work', ']', 'still', 'need', 'medical', 'help', 'Too', 'late', 'When', 'man', 'woman', 'must', 'lose', 'Will', 'bargain', 'new', 'woman', 'witnesses', 'sick', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'Anyone', 'who', 'lot', 'money', 'lottery', 'will', 'get', 'lot', 'attention', 'press', 'more', 'privacy', 'large', 'city', 'Philadelphia', 'Cleveland', 'small', 'rural', 'village', 'man', 'who', 'woman', 'captive', 'will', 'have', 'provide', 'needs', '34', 'feminine', 'products', '34', 'etc.', 'should', 'attract', 'attention', 'small', 'village', 'Would', 'lottery', 'winner', 'have', 'family', 'friends', 'most', 'real', 'people', 'Note', 'how', 'often', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'voice', 'was', 'doubled', 'synchronization', 'lip', 'movements', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'done', 'purpose', 'movie', 'show', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'happiness', '[', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'shop', ']', 'Would', ""n't"", 'police', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'real', 'life']",N/A
722603,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00006RJ5W,Alistair McHarg,"[21, 22]","This 40-year-old specimen by legendary director William Wyler will enhance any collection of fine film.  You may have trouble recognizing a very young Terence Stamp, whose performance as a painfully shy office clerk who hits the lottery will give you chills.  Samantha Eggar, lovely as the focus of his attention, gives a compelling performance and is in many ways the film's centerpiece.  Based on the novel by truly gifted author John Fowles, The Collector chronicles a subtle, incremental descent into madness and cruelty with such skill that viewers are engaged throughout, indeed, it is the ability of the film to penetrate the viewer's own psychology that gives it its real power.Stamp's Freddie Clegg, newly rich, is free to indulge his eccentricities fully, without fear of repercussion.  While his passion has always been butterfly collecting, Freddie, socially inept and pathologically lonely, slips into another level; he ""collects"" Eggar's Miranda Grey and keeps her captive in his remote estate.  With pathetic innocence he lavishes care on her, imaging that she will be won over and come to love him in her time.  She cringes through this process, and we cringe with her.  The entire situation is unbearably creepy, made all the creepier because of the nuance and exceptional acting.Hoping all the while that Miranda will find salvation, we know in our heart of hearts that such situations rarely end well.  Miranda's response to imprisonment evolves, we see her trying new tactics, we root for her.  Because we're involved, everything that happens has meaning.  This film contains virtually no physical violence, (certainly no hideous language, stacks of corpses, or nail gun brain surgery), indeed, it may be the most sympathetic portrayal of a stalker ever made.By not reducing Freddie to a symbol, but showing him instead as a person, however disturbed, Fowles and Wyler have given us something much more upsetting - a picture of our own worst self.  The hacks that practice the craft of filmmaking today, gleefully spraying blood onto the first 20 rows of theatres nationwide, would do well to watch The Collector.  This movie succeeds the old-fashioned way; it earns the undivided attention of its audience.",5,Belongs In Your Collection,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,2227,"['40-year-old', 'specimen', 'legendary', 'director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'will', 'enhance', 'collection', 'fine', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'recognizing', 'very', 'young', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'performance', 'painfully', 'shy', 'office', 'clerk', 'who', 'lottery', 'will', 'give', 'chills', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'lovely', 'focus', 'attention', 'compelling', 'performance', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'centerpiece', 'Based', 'novel', 'truly', 'gifted', 'author', 'John', 'Fowles', 'Collector', 'subtle', 'incremental', 'descent', 'madness', 'cruelty', 'such', 'skill', 'viewers', 'are', 'engaged', 'indeed', 'ability', 'film', 'penetrate', 'viewer', 'own', 'psychology', 'real', 'power.Stamp', 'Freddie', 'Clegg', 'newly', 'rich', 'free', 'indulge', 'eccentricities', 'fully', 'fear', 'repercussion', 'passion', 'always', 'been', 'butterfly', 'collecting', 'Freddie', 'socially', 'inept', 'pathologically', 'lonely', 'level', 'collects', 'Eggar', 'Miranda', 'Grey', 'captive', 'remote', 'estate', 'pathetic', 'innocence', 'care', 'imaging', 'will', 'be', 'won', 'come', 'love', 'time', 'process', 'cringe', 'entire', 'situation', 'unbearably', 'creepy', 'made', 'creepier', 'nuance', 'exceptional', 'acting.Hoping', 'while', 'Miranda', 'will', 'find', 'salvation', 'know', 'heart', 'hearts', 'such', 'situations', 'rarely', 'end', 'well', 'Miranda', 'response', 'imprisonment', 'evolves', 'see', 'trying', 'new', 'tactics', 'root', ""'re"", 'involved', 'everything', 'meaning', 'film', 'virtually', 'physical', 'violence', 'certainly', 'no', 'hideous', 'language', 'stacks', 'corpses', 'nail', 'gun', 'brain', 'surgery', 'indeed', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'stalker', 'ever', 'not', 'reducing', 'Freddie', 'symbol', 'showing', 'instead', 'person', 'however', 'disturbed', 'Fowles', 'Wyler', 'have', 'given', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'upsetting', 'picture', 'own', 'worst', 'self', 'hacks', 'practice', 'craft', 'filmmaking', 'today', 'gleefully', 'spraying', 'blood', 'first', '20', 'rows', 'theatres', 'nationwide', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'watch', 'Collector', 'movie', 'old-fashioned', 'way', 'undivided', 'attention', 'audience']",N/A

It's a more obscure type of British film that is about a man-  an entomologist who collects butterflies. He ends up seeing a woman in a pub one day and decides to drug her, kidnap her and take her back to his home out in the countryside.There he imprisons her in some type of stone dwelling on the side of his house and visits everyday to talk to her and have her entertain him with conversation. He seems in love with her but some warped type of love or control deal. At the end you realize he really probably wasn't (he got over it quick) and is a real sicko.The actor plays a great sociopath type. You keep hoping he'll let the woman go eventually. The movie builds good tension and has suspense. If you can look past the 60's music, the dated look of the film, etc.. you will like it. If you like old movies you will like it.It's definitely aged but still holds up well with the good storyline/premise.

722606,A1K548TDR33DMN,B00006RJ5W,Anna Shlimovich,"[4, 4]","One of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen.  It is with great subtle mastery Terence Stamp's hero tightens the noose around Miranda's neck, destroying her world slowly by becoming more and more violent as he sees that his idea of making her his toy is failing.  I loved the eloquence of the scene where he tears apart the book she loves - ""The Catcher in the Rye"", and then the picture of Picasso - these are things that she admires and wants to share with him, yet he rejects anything new, unknown, contradicting to his narrow-minded world where he wants total superiority and dominance over his female slave, toy and prisoner.What makes the film so impressive and terrifying is the absurdity and grotesque of his constant declarations of love and respect for Miranda, while in fact he loves and respects only the doll of his dreams, HIS IDEA OF HER, but not a real woman. Certainly, eventually he gets deceived that instead of a doll, she is a human being with her own personality that he cannot control.  So he gets rid of such a bad toy.He admits it at the end, now looking for someone ""ordinary"".I wonder if there is any coincidence that she was giving him this book, as the movie starts with him catching the butterflies in the meadow.A great horror.",4,"Non pi&ugrave; andrai, farfallona amorosa.",1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,1268,"['One', 'best', 'psychological', 'thrillers', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'great', 'subtle', 'mastery', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'hero', 'noose', 'Miranda', 'neck', 'destroying', 'world', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'violent', 'idea', 'making', 'toy', 'failing', 'loved', 'eloquence', 'scene', 'where', 'apart', 'book', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'then', 'picture', 'Picasso', 'are', 'things', 'share', 'yet', 'anything', 'new', 'unknown', 'contradicting', 'narrow-minded', 'world', 'where', 'total', 'superiority', 'dominance', 'female', 'slave', 'toy', 'film', 'so', 'impressive', 'terrifying', 'absurdity', 'grotesque', 'constant', 'declarations', 'love', 'respect', 'Miranda', 'fact', 'only', 'doll', 'dreams', 'HIS', 'IDEA', 'OF', 'HER', 'not', 'real', 'woman', 'Certainly', 'eventually', 'deceived', 'instead', 'doll', 'human', 'being', 'own', 'personality', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'So', 'rid', 'such', 'bad', 'toy.He', 'end', 'now', 'looking', 'someone', 'ordinary', '.I', 'wonder', 'coincidence', 'was', 'giving', 'book', 'movie', 'catching', 'butterflies', 'meadow.A', 'great', 'horror']",N/A
722607,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00006RJ5W,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 6/14Rate: 86/14: The Collector is a colorful looking English serial killer picture. Sad to say, the genre is quite old and redundant today because it's too easy to list the typical, rather predictable, manners that a serial killer follows. So, there is absolutely nothing new in The Collector, and I am quite sure it did influence some would-be serial killers back in its day. There are several negative aspects about the film. Firstly, it's a bit too talky, rather too much philosophizing, for my taste. I just find it unrealistic. Secondly, Terence Stamp is way too good looking to not attract women; apparently, I find his character's motives highly implausible. If a plainer looking person, I think Tom Courtenay is a better choice, is cast instead, The Collector can be more believable to watch. Thirdly, unfortunately, most of the time, the male kidnapper, who takes a female captive, usually considers sex as the foremost reason of having her. So, I don't believe this respect thing at all. On the other hand, Terence Stamp and Samantha Eggar are both wonderful and make a workable two-man show, and the film is well-made, thanks to William Wyler's unfailingly magic touch. The best part is the psychological game that both play: a lot of give and take. I actually like how the film ends as Stamp's character goes on another hunt as if it's just another day, a bit of a rarity that time. All in all, The Collector is too redundant for the serial killer genre, but it's not too bad really.",4,Good But Highly Redundant.,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,1503,"['Viewed', '6/14Rate', '86/14', 'Collector', 'colorful', 'looking', 'English', 'serial', 'killer', 'picture', 'Sad', 'say', 'genre', 'quite', 'old', 'redundant', 'today', 'too', 'easy', 'list', 'typical', 'rather', 'predictable', 'manners', 'serial', 'killer', 'So', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'new', 'Collector', 'am', 'quite', 'sure', 'did', 'influence', 'would-be', 'serial', 'killers', 'back', 'day', 'are', 'several', 'negative', 'aspects', 'film', 'Firstly', 'bit', 'too', 'talky', 'rather', 'too', 'much', 'philosophizing', 'taste', 'just', 'find', 'unrealistic', 'Secondly', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'way', 'too', 'good', 'looking', 'not', 'attract', 'women', 'apparently', 'find', 'character', 'motives', 'highly', 'implausible', 'plainer', 'looking', 'person', 'think', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'better', 'choice', 'cast', 'instead', 'Collector', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'believable', 'watch', 'Thirdly', 'unfortunately', 'most', 'time', 'male', 'kidnapper', 'who', 'female', 'captive', 'usually', 'sex', 'foremost', 'reason', 'having', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'respect', 'thing', 'other', 'hand', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'are', 'wonderful', 'make', 'workable', 'two-man', 'show', 'film', 'well-made', 'thanks', 'William', 'Wyler', 'unfailingly', 'magic', 'touch', 'best', 'part', 'psychological', 'game', 'play', 'lot', 'give', 'take', 'actually', 'how', 'film', 'Stamp', 'character', 'hunt', 'just', 'day', 'bit', 'rarity', 'time', 'Collector', 'too', 'redundant', 'serial', 'killer', 'genre', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'really']",N/A

722610,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00006RJ5W,California Dreaming,"[0, 1]","At a crucial scene, the antagonist looks at the protagonist, points at a print of a Picasso painting, and groans, ""Rubbish!  Pure rubbish!""  Well at least that antagonist -- aka ""The Collector"" -- had good taste.But the same couldn't be said about Leonard Lake, the serial killer from the San Francisco area who supposedly was influenced by this film.  But that may not be exactly fair; he was more a fan of the book but I do believe that he did also watch the movie, since his ex-wife ""Cricket"" even admitted as much in court.  I have not read that book, but I would imagine that it is not entirely different than this film, in which the screenplay was adapted.Mr. Lake seemed to pick and choose character traits from The Collector that seemed to fit the real-life serial killer best.  The Collector in this film was quite a ""gentleman,"" minus of course the whole kidnapping thing; while Mr. Lake could be called almost anything but a ""gentleman.""  The Collector gave his captive plenty of space, and brought her tea and breakfast on a tray every morning; Mr. Lake shoved his victim into the tiniest of dark spaces, and good luck with gourmet food.  So it was obvious that the filmmakers here tried to make The Collector out to be somewhat of a sympathetic character, while Mr. Lake gave no effort at all trying to make himself appear sympathetic.There are a whole. . .lotta. . . plot holes here.  For example, at one point, the Collector leaves the ""dungeon"" door wide open to drive and find a doctor for his captive -- she still being inside -- possibly allowing his little ""moth"" to fly away.  Why?  Wouldn't he have locked that door?  He always did in the film, at least until that moment.  Miranda did not escape, but only because at the time she wasn't physically able.  At another point, the Collector is standing right in front of Miranda and she could have easily poked him in the eye in an escape attempt.  I would have.  Why didn't she?  And she had the opportunity later to kill him outright but didn't.I peeked at a couple of reviews on this site, and at least one person didn't like the ending.  I thought that the ending was perfect, actually.  With a possible spoiler (jump to the last paragraph if you haven't watched):  the Collector in this film has two ""Mirandas"" -- the second is only shown for a moment, at the end -- while Mr. Lake had exactly two himself.

722611,A2XFII4E73279L,B00006RJ5W,"Charles Justus Garard ""Charles J. Garard Jr. PhD""","[2, 2]","Other reviewers of this excellent film based on John Fowles early novel criticize the poor transfer and editing or censoring of one scene of brief nudity, so I won't, as they say, go there. The film, in whatever condition the DVD happens to be in, will be my concern.The novel is written with a dual first-person point of view structure. The beginning and ending of the story are told from Clegg's perspective, and the middle passages reveal Miranda's perspective about what is-- or what she thinks is -- going on. Clegg tells us what Miranda doesn't know, and Miranda does the same; she even refers to him as Caliban, the unfortunate creature from Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST. In the film, we have a voice-over narrative by Terrance Stamp as Clegg only at the beginning and at the very end. Exposure to the character's thoughts gives audiences the first-person point of view. However, we never hear a voice-over by Samantha Eggar as Miranda.The dual first-person point of view is the perspective that director William Wyler affords viewers in his 1965 film version of the novel. Some critics, in fact, fault him for distracting audiences with outside points of view. Wyler, as we know, is noted for his use of a stationary camera and the wide-angle lens; in THE COLLECTOR, wide-angle shots, which create a deep-focus image, dominate the interior scenes. Through the years, from WUTHERING HEIGHTS in 1939 to THE BIG COUNTRY and BEN-HUR in the late 1950s, Wyler has been admired for his wide-angled vistas and deep-focus shots that give the viewer the option to choose from what is visually provided.The film opens with a long, establishing shot of a green meadow. Clegg enters the upper-right portion of the frame as a small figure. He chases a butterfly across the meadow as the single opening credit appears; from a close-up of a butterfly, which he captures and inspects, the camera raises to include his boyish face as he routinely places the specimen into a killing jar. When he notices the Tudor house, the lilting score by composer Maurice Jarre becomes ominous. He finds a sign that reads ""Freehold For Sale,"" and upon further inspection discovers the archway for the outside cellar. Suspenseful musical chords underscore the cinematic text as he approaches it, the huge net thrown over his shoulder. The net, in fact, seems be be purposely thrust toward the camera as if to collect the audience and drag it along with him. From then on, we, like Miranda, are caught in Clegg's net and, for the most part, are confined to the cellar until the end of the film, observers of the drama that Clegg not only stages and directs but acts in.When I showed THE COLLECTOR to film students at a small college in Atlanta, I had to break the showing into two halves to accommodate class scheduling. Before I began the second half of the film, I asked the students how they thought it was going to end. They thought that Miranda would eventually escape from Clegg and that Clegg would be caught and punished, which is what usually happens in British and American kidnapping/ sociopath films. That the novel and the film do not end as many of us expect is to its credit as a literary and cinematic work. For both to end in the usual way would detract from Fowles' message about people who are creators and people who are merely collectors and treat this subject as just another thriller.Although filmed in gorgeous Technicolor, one particular scene in the film is worth noting. A shimmering dissolve from a close shot of Clegg's face as he is gloating and being pelted by rain provides a visual transition to a black-and-white flashback of Clegg sitting at his desk in a bank while a co-worker dangles a butterfly mobile over his head. His bank colleagues laugh at this juvenile prank which Clegg fails to see until an artificial butterfly brushes his head. The sequence has no equivalent in the Fowles novel but it shows, better than words can describe, his alienation from society. Wyler avoids the first-person perspective; a voice-over narration is unnecessary.A wide shot after his aunt bursts in the door reveals Clegg crouched in one corner of the room. Wyler's skillful mise-en-scene allows the other bank clerks to appear larger and brighter as they sit at their desks, but when his aunt beckons him to the counter to inform him that something important has come to him in the post, he is the center of attention. He ambles with his head to one side -- a mannerism that he continues when confronting, or being confronted by, Miranda. ""I told you never to come into the bank,"" he whispers to her. This statement, joined with the fact that she has obviously opened his personal mail, reveals much about their relationship. Her lower-class appearance and manners link Clegg with a social status that he would undoubtedly prefer to conceal from his colleagues. She calls him Freddie, and this remains the only time viewers hear any references to his real name. Before Clegg can even read the letter, she bellows to the others that he has won 71,000 pounds on the football pools. Clegg is understandably stunned as colleagues gather around him, and his aunt expresses her delight like a hooting charwoman. The film dissolves again to a close shot of Clegg's face, once again in color, in the rain. This monochrome sequence remains the only flashback in the final cut of Wyler's THE COLLECTOR, the only view of Mona Washbourne as Clegg's aunt, and one of few expositional moments. G.P. -- Miranda's mentor and possible older lover in the novel -- never appears, except in one distant back shot in the pub; nor do any of the other characters revealed through Miranda's journal in the Fowles novel show up on the screen. What remains is a tight production which focuses mainly on the two antagonists. If the rough cut of the film, which supposedly includes other characters and more of the story, still remains, perhaps a future DVD version might be released as the EXTENDED CUT, which DVD companies like to tout.If you have not yet read El Lagarto's excellent review of this film elsewhere on this page, I recommend that you do. My own comments have been updated and revised, as are my comments on THE MAGUS also based on a John Fowles novel, from my dissertation and book POINT OF VIEW IN FICTION: FOCUS ON JOHN FOWLES. Reportedly, Fowles didn't approve of Wyler's version of THE COLLECTOR. While I recognize Fowles as one of the greatest British writers since D. H. Lawrence and Thomas Hardy, I fail to see many flaws in this production. THE COLLECTOR is tight and concise, emphasizing the two characters who represent the creators and collectors among us all.",5,William Wyler in a claustrophic setting,1249516800,"08 6,

Eggar comes off as too worldly and seductive (and old) to properly embody Miranda Grey as Fowles wrote her. In the novel Miranda was an innocent and an idealist, though in her ability to draw men she was described by Fowles in terms that reached out to the Jungian concept of the anima, but in this film she is a more aware presence who not only understood her powers of seduction but harnessed them. Likewise Terence Stamp seems all too prepared to be a cold mastermind, whereas Frederick Clegg in the book (the definitive source, let's say) was more or less a misfit who never lost a sense of wonder that his timidly attempted dream plan actually worked in bringing the object of his attraction into his life.Also in the film the relationship between the pair, Miranda and Freddie (aka Caliban) is far different than the one Fowles clearly described. True Clegg in the movie does promise to show Miranda ""every courtesy"" a line lifted straight from the text, but he is not the worshipful collector, he is more a cruel overlord whose self-confidence possesses none of the childlike wonder of the real character in the brilliant novel. Clegg in the book comprehends that he is undertaking acts of lawlessness but has no understanding that he is doing acts of egoistic evil; in the film Stamp plays Clegg as someone who understands his own darkness all too well.Okay, so clearly I love the novel and am not happy with this treatment of it, but I will confess that as far as a films go, this isn't a bad way to invest some time, and it does get the bare bones of Fowles' plot right, so if you are someone who prefers movies over books or if you're likely never going to take a day to let Fowles' masterpiece unwind in your brain, then this film version is a passable surrogate. True, I ripped up on it here, but I do own copies on both DVD and VHS, and have seen it at least five times, so maybe my criticisms are wider than they are deep.Four stars for the film, about ten stars for the book.",4,Good As A Stand Alone Movie But Frustrating As A Film Version Of An Ingeniously Written Novel,1189728000,"09 14, 2007",2007,2393,"['flesh', 'out', 'what', 'title', 'good', 'enough', 'movie', 'when', 'taken', 'own', 'merits', 'perhaps', 'fairness', 'consider', 'own', 'merits', 'someone', 'should', 'do', 'when', 'getting', 'tone', 'John', 'Fowles', 'masterful', 'novel', 'miserably.I', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'will', 'disagree', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'were', 'right', 'roles', 'played', 'Eggar', 'off', 'too', 'worldly', 'seductive', 'old', 'properly', 'embody', 'Miranda', 'Grey', 'Fowles', 'wrote', 'novel', 'Miranda', 'was', 'innocent', 'idealist', 'though', 'ability', 'draw', 'men', 'was', 'described', 'Fowles', 'terms', 'reached', 'Jungian', 'concept', 'anima', 'film', 'more', 'aware', 'presence', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'powers', 'seduction', 'harnessed', 'Likewise', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'too', 'prepared', 'be', 'cold', 'mastermind', 'whereas', 'Frederick', 'Clegg', 'book', 'definitive', 'source', 'let', 'say', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'misfit', 'who', 'never', 'lost', 'sense', 'wonder', 'timidly', 'attempted', 'dream', 'plan', 'actually', 'worked', 'bringing', 'object', 'attraction', 'life.Also', 'film', 'relationship', 'pair', 'Miranda', 'Freddie', 'aka', 'Caliban', 'far', 'different', 'one', 'Fowles', 'clearly', 'described', 'True', 'Clegg', 'movie', 'promise', 'show', 'Miranda', 'courtesy', 'line', 'lifted', 'straight', 'text', 'not', 'worshipful', 'collector', 'more', 'cruel', 'overlord', 'self-confidence', 'none', 'childlike', 'wonder', 'real', 'character', 'brilliant', 'novel', 'Clegg', 'book', 'undertaking', 'acts', 'lawlessness', 'understanding', 'doing', 'acts', 'egoistic', 'evil', 'film', 'Stamp', 'Clegg', 'someone', 'who', 'own', 'darkness', 'too', 'well.Okay', 'clearly', 'love', 'novel', 'am', 'not', 'happy', 'treatment', 'will', 'confess', 'as', 'far', 'films', 'go', ""n't"", 'bad', 'way', 'invest', 'time', 'get', 'bare', 'bones', 'Fowles', 'plot', 'right', 'so', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'movies', 'books', ""'re"", 'likely', 'never', 'going', 'take', 'day', 'let', 'Fowles', 'masterpiece', 'brain', 'then', 'film', 'version', 'passable', 'surrogate', 'True', 'ripped', 'up', 'here', 'do', 'own', 'copies', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'have', 'seen', 'least', 'five', 'times', 'maybe', 'criticisms', 'are', 'wider', 'are', 'deep.Four', 'stars', 'film', 'about', 'ten', 'stars', 'book']",N/A

What makes the movie truly memorable - is the fact that Freddy is not a predictable villain and the girl is not always sympathetic. The Collector is more than just a thriller in the way it shows the relationship between a prisoner and her jailer. All Freddie wants from Miranda is to get to know him and to love him and he is happy to fulfill her every desire only denying returning her freedom. The most memorable scene in the movie is the dialog between Miranda and Freddy after he had read Miranda's favorite book, ""Catcher in the Rye"" and they discuss it and the discussion turns into a very heated argument about the social and cultural differences between two completely different worlds they belong and why Freddie's of this world would hardly have a chance with girls like Miranda.Not widely known, the film is a real treasure and I highly recommend it. My only problem is the musical score by Maurice Jarre - it simply does not work very well in this movie and that surprised me knowing how effective Jarre's score was in ""Les Yeux sans visage"" (1960) aka ""Eyes Without Face"".I was so impressed with the movie that I checked out Fowles' novel (it was his first published book) from the public library and I will read it in the next few days",4,"""I just have to have you here a little longer.""",1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,1833,"['Collector', '1965', 'directed', 'William', 'Wyler', 'based', 'John', 'Fowles', 'novel', 'very', 'impressive', 'chilling', 'disturbing', 'film', 'story', 'shy', 'London', 'bank', 'employee', 'Freddie', 'Clegg', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'performance', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Award', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'avid', 'butterfly', 'collector', 'who', 'became', 'obsessed', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Art', 'Student', 'Miranda', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'also', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'winner', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominee', 'decided', 'kidnap', 'keep', 'part', 'collection', 'basement', 'secluded', 'house', 'country', 'side', 'What', 'movie', 'truly', 'memorable', 'fact', 'Freddy', 'not', 'predictable', 'villain', 'girl', 'not', 'always', 'sympathetic', 'Collector', 'more', 'just', 'thriller', 'way', 'relationship', 'prisoner', 'jailer', 'Freddie', 'Miranda', 'get', 'know', 'love', 'happy', 'fulfill', 'desire', 'only', 'denying', 'returning', 'freedom', 'most', 'memorable', 'scene', 'movie', 'dialog', 'Miranda', 'Freddy', 'had', 'read', 'Miranda', 'favorite', 'book', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'discuss', 'discussion', 'very', 'heated', 'argument', 'social', 'cultural', 'differences', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'worlds', 'belong', 'why', 'Freddie', 'world', 'would', 'hardly', 'have', 'chance', 'girls', 'Miranda.Not', 'widely', 'known', 'film', 'real', 'treasure', 'highly', 'recommend', 'My', 'only', 'problem', 'musical', 'score', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'simply', 'not', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'surprised', 'knowing', 'how', 'effective', 'Jarre', 'score', 'was', 'Les', 'Yeux', 'visage', '1960', 'Eyes', 'Face', '.I', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'movie', 'checked', 'out', 'Fowles', 'novel', 'was', 'first', 'published', 'book', 'public', 'library', 'will', 'read', 'next', 'few', 'days']",N/A

722622,A11I619N5ICKL9,B00006RJ5W,Kirk D. Knapp,"[2, 2]","It was a fantastic movie from 1965, and although most of the movie involved the interaction between only two people, a psychopathic Freddie Clegg and his captive, beautiful art student, Miranda Grey, it was exciting as each part of the movie unfolded.  The movie begins with Clegg, having won $200,000 finding an old Tudor House with a large root cellar which he turns into something similar to a dungeon.  Clegg follows Miranda, who is now his prey, as she walks home and then he kidnaps her. A superb performance by Samantha Eggar as Miranda was both dynamic and compelling as she tries to understand and counter Clegg's psychopathic behavior as his prisoner. Terrence Stamp also gives an excellent performance as jailer Freddie Clegg as he disguises Clegg's true madness until key parts of the movie, however it is Samantha Eggar's superb performance that makes Miranda come alive and grab your heart and cause you care for Miranda's wellbeing.  You want to help Miranda, but then you realize that she is alone with a madman and that you are only an observer and there is nothing you can do to help her. The key scene in the movie is where Clegg starts an argument with Miranda on the book ""Catcher in the Rye"" which is Miranda's favorite book and he calls the book pointless.  Miranda defends the book only to find Clegg show excruciating anger as he realizes that Miranda has not fallen in love with him and today is the day that he has promised to free her. You cry for Miranda as Clegg storms out of the cellar, locking door behind him as a crying Miranda lays at the bottom of the door saying ""O let me be free"".  Your expectations of Miranda's wellbeing is now changing and you are not sure if she going to come out this ordeal alive.  The movie is full of these sort of twists as you watch Clegg descend into greater madness and become more of a threat to Miranda's survival.  There have been suggestions that the ""The Collector"" should be remade, but that is nonsense.  William Wyler 1965 version is so superb that a remake would be nothing but disappointing as it is the definitive version of ""The Collector"" and likewise Samantha Eggar is the definitive Miranda Grey and Terence Stamp is the definitive Freddie Clegg.  Toward the very end of the movie, Samantha Eggar's sensitive performance grabs you by the heart again, as a very ill Miranda try's to convince Clegg take her to a hospital for medical treatment.  Miranda says to Clegg, ""that she doesn't want to die because there is a painting that she wants to do"" and then she describes the painting.  At that point in her performance, tears begin to flow in Samantha Eggar's eyes.  As I watched the scene unfold, tears also formed in my eyes, as I considered Miranda's situation. It is also in color which utilizes Samantha Eggar's beautiful face, exquisite auburn hair, and wonderful creamy complexion.I recommend that you purchase ""The Collector"" DVD for your DVD collection as it such a gem of a suspense movie.  I have purchased several copies just in case they stop producing this wonderful 1965 version of ""The Collector"" as it is movie that you will never forget, once you have seen it.",5,"The movie ""The Collector"" is tense and exciting from beginning to end.",1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,3161,"['was', 'fantastic', 'movie', '1965', 'most', 'movie', 'involved', 'interaction', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'psychopathic', 'Freddie', 'Clegg', 'captive', 'beautiful', 'art', 'student', 'Miranda', 'Grey', 'was', 'exciting', 'part', 'movie', 'unfolded', 'movie', 'Clegg', 'having', 'won', '200,000', 'finding', 'old', 'Tudor', 'House', 'large', 'root', 'cellar', 'something', 'similar', 'dungeon', 'Clegg', 'Miranda', 'who', 'now', 'prey', 'home', 'then', 'superb', 'performance', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'Miranda', 'was', 'dynamic', 'compelling', 'understand', 'counter', 'Clegg', 'psychopathic', 'behavior', 'prisoner', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'also', 'excellent', 'performance', 'jailer', 'Freddie', 'Clegg', 'Clegg', 'true', 'madness', 'key', 'parts', 'movie', 'however', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'superb', 'performance', 'Miranda', 'come', 'alive', 'grab', 'heart', 'cause', 'care', 'Miranda', 'wellbeing', 'want', 'help', 'Miranda', 'then', 'realize', 'alone', 'madman', 'are', 'only', 'observer', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'help', 'key', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'Clegg', 'argument', 'Miranda', 'book', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'Miranda', 'favorite', 'book', 'book', 'pointless', 'Miranda', 'book', 'only', 'find', 'Clegg', 'show', 'excruciating', 'anger', 'Miranda', 'not', 'fallen', 'love', 'today', 'day', 'promised', 'free', 'cry', 'Miranda', 'Clegg', 'cellar', 'locking', 'door', 'behind', 'crying', 'Miranda', 'bottom', 'door', 'saying', 'O', 'let', 'be', 'free', 'expectations', 'Miranda', 'wellbeing', 'now', 'changing', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'going', 'come', 'out', 'ordeal', 'alive', 'movie', 'full', 'sort', 'twists', 'watch', 'Clegg', 'descend', 'greater', 'madness', 'become', 'more', 'threat', 'Miranda', 'survival', 'have', 'been', 'suggestions', 'Collector', 'should', 'be', 'remade', 'nonsense', 'William', 'Wyler', '1965', 'version', 'so', 'superb', 'remake', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'disappointing', 'definitive', 'version', 'Collector', 'likewise', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'definitive', 'Miranda', 'Grey', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'definitive', 'Freddie', 'Clegg', 'Toward', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'grabs', 'heart', 'again', 'very', 'ill', 'Miranda', 'try', 'convince', 'Clegg', 'take', 'hospital', 'medical', 'treatment', 'Miranda', 'Clegg', ""n't"", 'want', 'die', 'painting', 'do', 'then', 'painting', 'point', 'performance', 'begin', 'flow', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'eyes', 'watched', 'scene', 'unfold', 'tears', 'also', 'formed', 'eyes', 'considered', 'Miranda', 'situation', 'also', 'color', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'beautiful', 'face', 'exquisite', 'auburn', 'hair', 'wonderful', 'creamy', 'complexion.I', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'Collector', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'collection', 'gem', 'suspense', 'movie', 'have', 'purchased', 'several', 'copies', 'just', 'case', 'stop', 'producing', 'wonderful', '1965', 'version', 'Collector', 'movie', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'once', 'have', 'seen']",N/A

If you thing of a butterfly it is fragile, feminine and colorful. The character played by stamp begins to transfer his need to collect butterflys to women. He has become obsessed with one woman in particular and sets about devising a plan to capture her. It is sad in that he does not know how to relate to people, and I think turns inward, using his collection to fill his lonliness and isolation. She becomes his link to happiness, unfortunately all she does is intensify his abandonment issues. He wants her to feel the same way as he does for her. She wants to escape and trys to control him so she doesn't have to feel her fear. He allows the control trying to please her so he can make her fall in love with him, up to a point, he will not let her go. Stamp's character cannot push past his id to allow a real relationship to happen it has to be in the confines of his collecting behavior. There is definately a human element to the film, which makes it really worthwhile, its not a slasher horror film, it might look that way, but it is not. In a way, it is a delicate film, sad and somewhat scary as perceived if looking at the girl's point of view. The only thing I didn't like is the common approach Stamp's character took at the end of the film.

And after I did I told myself I'd never go through with the plan, even though I'd made all the preparations and knew where she was every minute of the day.'With these opening lines, Freddie Clegg (Terence Stamp) confirms to the viewer that a ride of haunting and psychological suspense is in store for all who attempt to harness a personality so perplexing and multilayered. Clegg possesses a personality that dwells in the valley of sexual repression and delayed maturity, skirting peaks of gauche inferiority to his surrounding peers. His life revolves around the low of his dreary job as a bank clerk to what he considers his supreme hold on life as he knows it -- the collecting of butterflies. He has just won a considerable amount of money on the English football pools and what he intends to do with it is the gist of this tale -- the collection of a human specimen in the form of London art student, Miranda Grey (Samantha Eggar).Clegg purchases an Elizabethan country estate that holds the prize of ancient cellars that will contain his quarry. Once Miranda has been spirited away in a kidnapping by him, the real story begins. A game of cat and mouse ensues and over the course of the erupting minutes, one is never quite sure what will or will not happen. Will she escape or will evil prevail?Terence Stamp and Samantha Eggar have etched luminous performances under the direction of veteran Hollywood director, William Wyler. Stamp's Clegg is horrifying in an obscene way, for he projects terror as can only be portrayed by one who is truly mad and consorting with harbingers of class distinction as he perceives them to be. He is that most capable of monsters who needs no makeup or agents from the supernatural world to make his mark, but rather the corrupt nature of a beast that blends so well into the woodwork as to be unseen to the naked eye. The precision of each move he makes and the play from his dark eyes as they change, chameleon like, from drone to madman, are a marvelous and terrifying thing to see.Samantha Eggar is Stamp's perfect foil, the hunted as pursued by the hunter, in a match that will determine her ultimate fate. She is in a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation. She morphs from a carefree, young art student to a woman caught in a web of deceit, sexual outbursts and insanity. She has become the latest 'catch' for Clegg, the crown jewel of his collection. Miranda has only one way out -- to learn to love Clegg by being his 'guest'. Will she? It will become a battle of survival of the fittest.The Collector is based upon the novel by John Fowles that created such a stir in the early 60's. The book took the form of a diary as written by Miranda after her capture and betrayed all of the emotions, gambits and tragedies that befell the twosome. The screenplay as written by Stanley Mann and John Kohn is quite literate and maintains a steady stream of interest in this royal battle of the sexes. They were both nominated for and Oscar Best Screenplay, along with Wyler for Best Director and Eggar as Best Actress. Wyler is best known as the director of such perennial favourites as Ben Hur, The Best Years of Our Lives and Wuthering Heights.While the acting takes place on a very limited set for the most part and a feeling of a stage production making itself evident, the story and the acting are the glue that hold the production together. The latter two are superbly realized.The soundtrack is by veteran composer Maurice Jarre, and while it is effective for the most part, at times it is too much and presents a dilemma. Less can sometimes be more. Jarre seems unsure in his attempts and while a theme runs throughout the film, elements that seem to be presented for effect get in the way. Jarre is capable of much better when presented with a real challenge.This film is a quiet little gem; that diamond in the rough that is either overlooked or never quite discovered for the wonder that it is. It is a decided change of pace from productions that would have been profoundly filled with blood, gore and special effects to get their point across.

I was immediately enamored of Terence Stamp, a very underrated actor, in this very riveting performance. Freddie Clegg's obsession with the lovely, quintessential 60s young lady, Miranda Grey (the unforgettable Samantha Eggar), is one of those things that, at the time, may have seemed quite radical, and it is obvious that both John Sayles' novel and William Wyler's film were both way ahead of the time. The violence is understated, and the psychology of both the main characters subtle, yet the viewer has no trouble comprehending their thoughts, feelings and actions. Stamp excels in this portrayal of a withdrawn, lonely young man who has an empty life, with only his collection of butterflies to stimulate him. Eggar, as the object of his obsession, represents to him and innocent, wholesome ideal, someone he feels will understand him, accept him, and he hopes, love him. After he meticulously stalks her, plans her abduction and locks her in the cellar of his newly purchased country home, both individuals have to come to terms with the result of his actions, causing conflict, an unlikely relationship, and, ultimately, dangerous consequences. Miranda does try to understand Freddie, even attempts to compromise with him, but only manages to infuriate her captor and fuel his feelings of being a misfit of society. As she becomes more and more desperate to escape, his anger and controlling behavior only intensifies. As a last resort, she attempts to seduce him, but he is obviously very sexually repressed (and hey, so are many of the stalkers out there today!), and is temporarily tempted, but becomes disgusted, basically saying ""You're just like all the rest!"" After she injures him with a shovel, and he leaves her locked in the cellar as he seeks medical treatment, Miranda is left in a life-threatening situation, and with no escape in sight, succumbs to pneumonia not long after Freddie's return. His mixed feelings of grief and blaming Miranda for her own fate shows a hint of the mental disorders that many offenders of this kind suffer from. It is also obvious that he has learned nothing from this experience, and, as the film concludes, he is out stalking another victim.I found this film disturbing but thrilling, and it's a treat to see such gifted actors bring this story to life. If you liked this movie, see ""That Cold Day In The Park"" (1968), starring the late Sandy Dennis, and ""Kiss The Girls"" starring Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd.I highly recommend this ""mod"" masterpiece!

722629,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00006RJ5W,Only-A-Child,"[3, 4]","Although the kidnap/hostage situation in William Wyler's psychological thriller ""The Collector"" (1966) has some superficial similarities to ""Silence of the Lambs"", it offers a much more complex and subtle dynamic. The two main characters find themselves both in a classic ""can't win"" situation. Freddie (Terence Stamp) desperately hopes that Miranda (Samantha Egger) will fall in love with him but his love for her is so unrealistic that any deviation from his preconceived notions of their ideal relationship frustrates him. Miranda is trapped figuratively as much as literally; any resistance makes Freddie angry and yet he detects insincerity when she tries to conform to his wishes.So while the screenplay omits the best elements of John Fowles' bestseller it does generate a fair amount of chess match type tension from its doomed dynamic.That the film falls short of cinema greatness is mostly because Wyler is unable to establish an effective point of view. Freddie bookends the story with some voice-over narration but everything between is told from a sterile neutral perspective that makes character identification impossible.Freddie is a childlike young man who has developed an obsession with unsuspecting art student Miranda. He has been observing her from afar for some time, then one day he puts his plan into action and abducts her with his van and imprisons her in the basement room of an isolated estate he has just purchased. Freddie knows that he would normally stand no chance with a privileged and beautiful girl like Miranda (there is a social class subtext to the film). He hopes that when she gets to know him through forced contact that she will fall in love with the person he is beneath the surface. This is not a ""Stockholm Syndrome"" dependency type of thing but rather Freddie's belief that the only obstacle to their love is getting past the superficial obstacles to them relating to each other in a normal situation.There is also an implication that he wants her more for display purposes than for companionship and this is given considerable compare and contrast treatment with his hobby of butterfly collecting.Freddie is too likable and Stamp has some trouble selling the occasional violent mood swings; whatever his psychosis it is given a very shallow and uneven treatment. Michael Powell's ""Peeping Tom"" featured a much more disturbed villain and neatly connected the viewer to his POV. And Egger is too sterile for the film to generate much erotic interest even with its frequent bondage scenes. Not being able to strongly identify with either character limits the amount of suspense and the lamely tacked on twist at the very end is out of character and breaks the film's unity.Wyler's excellent acting for the camera direction generates solid performances from Stamp and Egger, and makes for an above average film well worth your viewing time. The Columbia DVD features a good  print color-wise but not the cinema original-rather it appears to be a 4:3 version that was cropped vertically to appear as widescreen.

This is highlighted, first, by the performances themselves, which are superficially cold but in reality display a great deal of underlying warmth. But it's also underscored by the fact that William Wyler's madman is only an accidental murderer, his intention being only to harbor his object of desire, not murder her (murder, as it happens, being simply the ""collateral"" result of his own perversity).""The Collector,"" in fact, is probably the most humanized portrait of a sociopath ever put on film, and Terence Stamp makes us realize in every scene just how starved for affection he is. Not even ""Peeping Tom"" rivals it in this respect, since the analytical approach of Michael Powell toward his deranged protagonist, not to mention the peculiar fetishism involved, prevents us from really identifying with him. By contrast, Stamp's character could easily represent any otherwise ""normal"" human being, who is merely more estranged and sensitive than most.The DVD transfer of the film is fine, certainly not the best conversion of a sixties film I've seen, but still doing credit to the film. The sound is also superior, and I personally love Maurice Jarre's theme music, particularly the beautifully orchestrated version played during the closingcredits.One caution, however: this DVD has been edited slightly, and those used to seeing the brief frontal nudity of Ms. Eggar during the ""seduction"" sequence in the final quarter of the film will search in vain for it here. This seems to have resulted from some absurd prudery on the part of the company, but it also hurts the film, since the nudity, far from being ""pornographic,"" highlights the intimacy of the scene, and, in addition, serves to emphasize Stamp's reaction to Eggar's slow and delicate offering of herself. Just one more example, in other words, of how the bowdlerizing of a film against the director's wishes is always a perilous exercise.",5,"Brilliant, despite the editing",1045699200,"02 20, 2003",2003,2117,"['Collector', 'Psycho', 'tradition', 'focusing', 'repressed', 'sexual', 'longings', 'quietly', 'alienated', 'loner', 'closer', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'portraying', 'sympathetic', 'side', 'killer', 'highlighted', 'first', 'performances', 'are', 'superficially', 'cold', 'reality', 'display', 'great', 'deal', 'underlying', 'warmth', 'also', 'underscored', 'fact', 'William', 'Wyler', 'madman', 'only', 'accidental', 'murderer', 'intention', 'being', 'only', 'harbor', 'object', 'desire', 'not', 'murder', 'murder', 'being', 'simply', 'collateral', 'result', 'own', 'perversity', 'Collector', 'fact', 'probably', 'most', 'humanized', 'portrait', 'sociopath', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'realize', 'scene', 'just', 'how', 'starved', 'affection', 'Not', 'even', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'respect', 'analytical', 'approach', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'deranged', 'protagonist', 'not', 'mention', 'peculiar', 'fetishism', 'involved', 'prevents', 'really', 'identifying', 'contrast', 'Stamp', 'character', 'could', 'easily', 'represent', 'otherwise', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'merely', 'more', 'estranged', 'sensitive', 'most.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'film', 'fine', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'conversion', 'sixties', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'still', 'doing', 'credit', 'film', 'sound', 'also', 'superior', 'personally', 'love', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'theme', 'music', 'particularly', 'beautifully', 'orchestrated', 'version', 'played', 'closingcredits.One', 'caution', 'however', 'DVD', 'been', 'edited', 'slightly', 'used', 'seeing', 'brief', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'Ms.', 'Eggar', 'seduction', 'sequence', 'final', 'quarter', 'film', 'will', 'search', 'vain', 'here', 'have', 'resulted', 'absurd', 'prudery', 'part', 'company', 'also', 'film', 'nudity', 'far', 'being', 'pornographic', 'intimacy', 'scene', 'addition', 'emphasize', 'Stamp', 'reaction', 'Eggar', 'slow', 'delicate', 'offering', 'Just', 'one', 'more', 'example', 'other', 'words', 'how', 'bowdlerizing', 'film', 'director', 'wishes', 'always', 'perilous', 'exercise']",N/A

722634,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,B00006RJ5W,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[2, 4]","I have a little different take on this excellent movie than most other reviewers.  The film puts the personality and activities of a certain kind of sexual psychopath under the microscope.  In doing so it treats both the kidnapper and his victim with sympathy.  The film is, in fact, an excruciating portrayal of a truly terrible crime.Frank--the Terrence Stamp character--has most of the characteristics of most serial sexual sadists.  His personality is such that he has major difficulty in establishing personal relationships so he is an archetypal 'loner'.  Also, in a way both different and similar to most such psychopaths, he is sexually conflicted.  Granted, most serial sexual killers discharge their sexual confusion more quickly and lethally but, good old Frank--over a period of four weeks--accomplishes much the same thing.Frank, if you think about it, has prepared his 'torture' chamber in much the same way as certain serial killers.  In anticipation of his victim, he has carefully and painstakingly prepared a dungeon from which it is nearly impossible to escape.  He has prepared his own house in much the same way.  Frank exudes desperate longing which he confuses with normal feelings.  Frank, however, is nearly devoid of normal empathy.  He is entirely capable of feeling his own pain but is incapable of feeling the fear, despair and horror of his victim.  From Frank's point of view, it is the girl's fault for ""not trying to fall in love with me.""  It is her ""fault' for being educated, intelligent and [from Frank's limited point of view] having snooty friends who will always look down on him.  Even at the end, when Frank is hunting his next victim, he justifies the gruesome outcome of his first crime.  It wouldn't have happened except for the girl's actions and inactions.  Frank is DEVOID of insight.Yes, each serial sexual psychopath demonstrates different traits.  Ted Bundy, although as abnormal as a human being could be, moved smoothly through society enabling him to 'collect' a huge number of victims.  Bundy, like certain other sexual perverts, was a necrophiliac.  It should be noted that Frank in the movie seems to consider a similar act.  Frank, who has so much difficulty sexually connecting with his conscious victim has far less difficulty 'loving up' the chloroformed and unconscious girl.  Jeffrey Dahmer 'operated' on the brains of his homosexual victims in predictably failed efforts to produce the 'ideal' passive partner.  Ing and his partner in California prepared captivity and torture chambers.  Like Frank, our collector, they sometimes kept their victims for weeks before tiring of them, killing them, and moving on to the next victim.Do the 'Franks' of the world--because they are driven by uncontrollable urges--deserve our sympathy?  I certainly don't think so.",5,Perverse,1349395200,"10 5, 2012",2012,2822,"['have', 'little', 'different', 'take', 'excellent', 'movie', 'most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'film', 'personality', 'activities', 'certain', 'kind', 'sexual', 'psychopath', 'microscope', 'doing', 'kidnapper', 'victim', 'sympathy', 'film', 'fact', 'excruciating', 'portrayal', 'truly', 'terrible', 'crime.Frank', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'character', 'most', 'characteristics', 'most', 'serial', 'sexual', 'sadists', 'personality', 'such', 'major', 'difficulty', 'establishing', 'personal', 'relationships', 'archetypal', ""'loner"", 'Also', 'way', 'different', 'similar', 'most', 'such', 'psychopaths', 'sexually', 'conflicted', 'Granted', 'most', 'serial', 'sexual', 'killers', 'discharge', 'sexual', 'confusion', 'more', 'quickly', 'lethally', 'good', 'old', 'Frank', 'period', 'four', 'weeks', 'accomplishes', 'much', 'same', 'thing.Frank', 'think', 'prepared', ""'torture"", 'chamber', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'certain', 'serial', 'killers', 'anticipation', 'victim', 'carefully', 'painstakingly', 'prepared', 'dungeon', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'escape', 'prepared', 'own', 'house', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Frank', 'exudes', 'desperate', 'longing', 'normal', 'feelings', 'Frank', 'however', 'nearly', 'devoid', 'normal', 'empathy', 'entirely', 'capable', 'feeling', 'own', 'pain', 'incapable', 'feeling', 'fear', 'despair', 'horror', 'victim', 'Frank', 'point', 'view', 'girl', 'fault', 'not', 'trying', 'fall', 'love', 'fault', 'being', 'educated', 'intelligent', '[', 'Frank', 'limited', 'point', 'view', ']', 'having', 'snooty', 'friends', 'who', 'will', 'always', 'look', 'down', 'Even', 'end', 'when', 'Frank', 'hunting', 'next', 'victim', 'gruesome', 'outcome', 'first', 'crime', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'happened', 'girl', 'actions', 'inactions', 'Frank', 'DEVOID', 'insight.Yes', 'serial', 'sexual', 'psychopath', 'different', 'traits', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'as', 'abnormal', 'human', 'being', 'could', 'be', 'moved', 'smoothly', 'society', 'enabling', ""'collect"", 'huge', 'number', 'victims', 'Bundy', 'certain', 'other', 'sexual', 'perverts', 'was', 'necrophiliac', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Frank', 'movie', 'consider', 'similar', 'act', 'Frank', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'difficulty', 'sexually', 'connecting', 'conscious', 'victim', 'far', 'less', 'difficulty', ""'loving"", 'up', 'chloroformed', 'unconscious', 'girl', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', ""'operated"", 'brains', 'homosexual', 'victims', 'predictably', 'failed', 'efforts', 'produce', ""'ideal"", 'passive', 'partner', 'Ing', 'partner', 'California', 'prepared', 'captivity', 'torture', 'chambers', 'Frank', 'collector', 'sometimes', 'kept', 'victims', 'weeks', 'tiring', 'killing', 'moving', 'next', 'victim.Do', ""'Franks"", 'world', 'are', 'driven', 'uncontrollable', 'urges', 'deserve', 'sympathy', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so']",N/A

In fact, the only time he gets noticed is when he is being made fun of. Freddy gets his enjoyment in life from collecting and studying butterflies, and he must have killed a thousand specimens in this enterprise. His first love is Miranda Grey, a girl he's studied for years, but one who's never seen him despite riding the bus together all through high-school. When Freddy wins a large sum of money in the lottery, he quits his job as a bank clerk and is now able to devote himself full time to collecting; however, what he has in mind is Miranda. If only she could get to know him surely his feelings of love would be reciprocated. And so with careful planning he purchases a remote old house in the country, kidnaps the girl, and sets her up in a locked room completely furnished to her tastes. ""They'll come looking for me!"" she threatens. ""They are,"" says Freddy, ""but no one's looking for me.""

722640,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00006RJ5W,trebe,"[2, 2]","Based on a book by the same name, The Collector (1965), a tale of twisted obsession, is impeccably directed by multiple Oscar winner William Wyler (Ben-Hur,Funny Girl, Wurthering Heights,Roman Holiday).  Set in England, the story is very much in the dark tradition of British suspense, with mild gothic overtones, and an atmosphere reminiscent of a Hammer production.  Wyler, and stars Terrence Stamp and Samantha Eggar would all garner Academy Award nominations for their work on the film, which is not to be confused with Marcus Dunstan's The Collector (2009).  Mild spoilers follow.Frederick Clegg (Stamp), an employee at a bank, wins a large fortune in a football pool.  He buys a house in the country, which has a detached cellar, and a room hidden behind a shelf.  Clegg, whose hobby is entomology, is an avid collector of butterflies.  He is also mentally unbalanced, and has become obsessed with art student Miranda Grey (Eggar).  Following her in his van as she walks through the streets, Clegg sets a trap and abducts the woman using chloroform, a chemical that is commonly used to kill butterflies.Clegg takes Miranda to his home, and puts her in the hidden room.  Dressed in a suit, Clegg greets his guest in a detached manner, seemingly unable to understand why she does not want to stay and be his guest.  Miranda is confused, but doesn't panic, attempting to reason with Clegg, who promises not to harm her.  Miranda eventually agrees to stay for a month, after which Frederick says he will release her.Aside from a few trips to the village, and an incident where a neighbor happens by while Miranda is having a bath, much of the film features just Clegg and his prisoner.  While visiting the house, Clegg shows Miranda his butterfly collection.  In a room filled with display cases containing mounted insects, the symbolism between the butterflies and Miranda is obvious, and she herself notes that she is just another object he has collected.Frederick's secret hope is that Miranda will appreciate his efforts, and fall in love with him, instead Miranda naturally only sees him as her delusional captor.  Assuming that she will be set free, Miranda endures her time in captivity, while counting off the days until liberation.  On the last day, an expectant Miranda has dinner with Frederick in the main house, where he proposes marriage.  Miranda breaks down and becomes violent, when it becomes clear that Clegg has broken his word.With no hope in sight, Miranda attempts to seduce Frederick, but he rejects her, saying that he has lost respect for her.  Dealing with a madman can be very confusing, but Miranda changes gears nicely and attempts to escape.  Unfortunately she hesitates at a critical moment, and finds herself in her prison, praying for her captor's return.Under the direction of William Wyler, The Collector is atmospheric and finely crafted.  Aside from some flashbacks, things play very smoothly.  As the story is being told from Clegg's viewpoint, it has a rather cold feel and clinical tone, while serving as a marvelous showpiece for its two stars.  Terence Stamp (The Limey, The Adjustment Bureau) is chilling as the creepy Clegg, who almost always impeccably dressed in a suit, is a person who has lost touch with reality, and like a selfish child, is petty, spiteful, and mostly capable of seeing only his needs.  Although he does treat Miranda almost like a specimen, it's hard to hate Clegg, as he is so obviously insane.  Samantha Eggar (Doctor Dolittle, The Molly Maguires) is also excellent, as her character attempts to cope with a nightmarish situation.  Although initially Miranda does display a spunky rebellious streak, and even tries to get into Clegg's head, in the end, she unfortunately puts too much trust in her captor.  She is smart, and tries several ploys, but unluckily for her, none of them result in freedom.Dark and twisted, The Collector is old fashioned British suspense.  The film would probably play out much differently today, but with an underlying mean streak, Wyler achieves exactly what he was aiming for.  Although perhaps fresh and new in 1965, abduction has long become an all too common scenario in horror, and to accent that theme, horror films today often feature excessive violence or gore, with also perhaps a blood spattered heroine pushed to extreme limits, turning the tables on her captor.The Disappearance of Alice Creed(2009),Eden Lake(2008), andMum and Dad(2008), are some recent examples from the genre set in Britain, that have a modern approach, while maintaining the dark tone often found in traditional British horror.",4,taking a hobby to a creepy new level...,1335398400,"04 26,
