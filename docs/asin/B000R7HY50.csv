Unbelievable gimmicks, no explanation for the title, or how our hero manages to go back and forth in time.  Add some inept performances from Raymond Anthony Bailey, Laura Fuller and Liz Cunningham and you have a reasonably inexplicable movie.  nice try, though.",2,TIME WARPED,1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,363,"['11:59', 'film', 'interesting', 'premise', 'so', 'poorly', 'executed', 'premise', 'Unbelievable', 'gimmicks', 'explanation', 'title', 'how', 'hero', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'Add', 'inept', 'performances', 'Raymond', 'Anthony', 'Bailey', 'Laura', 'Fuller', 'Liz', 'Cunningham', 'have', 'reasonably', 'inexplicable', 'movie', 'nice', 'try', 'though']",11:59
1080033,A2IV22IN8A1I1K,B000R7HY50,Steven J. Weller,"[0, 0]","Fantastic-looking film, with surprisingly high production values for a low-budget first feature.  The only failing is the script, which plays like a couple of high school kids' take on grown-up life, as seen by way of time travel and new-age mysticism.  This makes a certain amount of sense, as it's a story about grown-up life by way of time travel and new-age mysticism, written by a couple of high school kids.  It took them a few years to get the funding but the roots still show.  Still, an entertaining film if you like this sort of thing, and a great primer on making a low-budget film - most especially if you're working out of town.  This isn't nearly as good as their next film, Ink, but absolutely worth a look.",3,"From The Makers of ""Ink""",1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,722,"['Fantastic-looking', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'low-budget', 'first', 'feature', 'only', 'failing', 'script', 'couple', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'take', 'grown-up', 'life', 'seen', 'way', 'time', 'travel', 'new-age', 'mysticism', 'certain', 'amount', 'sense', 'story', 'grown-up', 'life', 'way', 'time', 'travel', 'new-age', 'mysticism', 'written', 'couple', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'took', 'few', 'years', 'get', 'funding', 'roots', 'still', 'show', 'Still', 'entertaining', 'film', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'great', 'primer', 'making', 'low-budget', 'film', 'most', 'especially', ""'re"", 'working', 'town', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'next', 'film', 'Ink', 'absolutely', 'look']",11:59

1080035,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B000R7HY50,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","11:59 is as indie as independent films get and from the very beginning you could tell, this was not a film that had any kind of budget. The film is yet another take on Groundhog Day, as a man wakes up in a field, missing 24 hours. He goes about his day trying to figure out what happened, when miraculously he winds up back in the missing day and continues to re-live it. Being that this film had no budget, it was up to the cast to make it believable and worthwhile, unfortunately they fail miserably at it. I get that they were all newcomers, looking for their big break, but the performances here are beyond awful. The lead is played by Raymond Bailey, who has no personality. He actually had long scenes where he wonders around aimlessly, without saying a word, and just doesn't know what to do with himself. The rest of the cast was also terrible, ranging from boring to completely over the top. I've seen a lot of a bad movies and most didn't have the story to work with, that 11:59 did. I can honestly say never have I seen a cast of people who were less qualified to be on the screen. The low budget meant no special effects and no big named actors, but in order to make the film work, they had to give us something, but didn't! When I wasn't in shock over how bad the acting was, I was bored out of my mind, this movie was nothing but a huge waste of time!",1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,1365,"['11:59', 'as', 'indie', 'independent', 'films', 'get', 'very', 'beginning', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'had', 'kind', 'budget', 'film', 'yet', 'take', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'man', 'up', 'field', 'missing', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'miraculously', 'up', 'back', 'missing', 'day', 're-live', 'Being', 'film', 'had', 'budget', 'was', 'up', 'cast', 'make', 'believable', 'worthwhile', 'unfortunately', 'fail', 'miserably', 'get', 'were', 'newcomers', 'looking', 'big', 'break', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'awful', 'lead', 'played', 'Raymond', 'Bailey', 'who', 'personality', 'actually', 'had', 'long', 'scenes', 'where', 'around', 'aimlessly', 'saying', 'word', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'also', 'terrible', 'ranging', 'boring', 'completely', 'top', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'bad', 'movies', 'most', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'story', 'work', '11:59', 'did', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'cast', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'less', 'qualified', 'be', 'screen', 'low', 'budget', 'meant', 'special', 'effects', 'big', 'named', 'actors', 'order', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'had', 'give', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'When', 'was', ""n't"", 'shock', 'how', 'bad', 'acting', 'was', 'was', 'bored', 'mind', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'huge', 'waste', 'time']",11:59
