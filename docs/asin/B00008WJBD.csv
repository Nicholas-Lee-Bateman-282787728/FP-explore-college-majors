The surprising thing, however, is that I was unaware there was enough &quot;best of&quot; material to even fill a single DVD, let alone a set of them!The longevity of Arli$$ is inexplicable, just as it was unbelievable that Suddenly Susan ran for so long in NBC's coveted Thursday night lineup.  Everything here is stale, from the hackneyed storylines, to the obvious Jerry Maguire overtones that may have been relevant in 1996, but have long since overstayed their welcome.Save your $$.

Well, it's about time because this is one of those shows that you need to get and keep. It's a good thing they put this show on HBO because it would have never worked on network or cable TV.Arliss is one of the funniest shows I have seen. Not sitcom family funny, but adult only almost X-rated funny at times. Believe me, this show is not for the kids, it is adult humor all the way. Arliss Michaels is a sports super agent and the show basically deals with his everyday life and the headaches and problems he has to go throw. Everything from making deals between players and teams to finding the next big plan to make more money! Arliss is an original show that is very smart and funny. There are a ton of cameos from actors and sports stars that are fun to watch! If the sports world or sports agents interest you at all then you will like this show.

748437,A1BCSSP7JJXMS0,B00008WJBD,Max A. Collins,"[7, 7]","ARLI$$ was promoted in its first season as a sports-world LARRY SANDERS SHOW, and ever since, this fine series (which lasted an impressive seven seasons) has been kicked around and wrongly criticized.  SANDERS is rightfully respected for its acid show biz comedy, but ARLI$$ takes a different approach, with a solid regular cast of selfish but not mean-spirited characters.  Creator Robert Wuhl as sports agent Arliss Michaels is a standout -- a cynic with a heart of marshmellow.  The tone swings wildly but from slapstick humor to genuine pathos, and yet consistently scores, as Wuhl and company explore serious topics unflinchingly in this satiric context.  (As in the Wuhl-starring film COBB, a frequent topic is heroes with feet of clay.)  This is a fine selection of first-rate episodes, but it's a pity this Hall of Fame-worthy comedy has been such a whipping boy so as to convince HBO only a &quot;best of&quot; is deserved, and not full season collections.  I'm not a diehard sports fan, but the insider show biz stories, the quirky but appealing regulars and surprisingly sensitive treatment of contemporary problems has turned me into a stone ARLI$$ fan.
