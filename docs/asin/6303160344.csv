She moans and dooms due to the loss of them. But, her new life begins. Supported by kind people, she tries to rebuild herself. On the other hand, the secrets of her husband are gradually revealed...Blue implies melancholy but also means liberty. It is depicted how a widow rebuilds new life and liberates herself from the tragedy.Oscar winner Juliet Binoche's performance will catch viewers' attention. This film won the best film and best actress of Venice Film Festival.Director Kieslowski is good at depicting two things at the same time. In ""Blue"", a widow's life rebuilding and the revealing process of the her husband's secrets. He is prominent in the unique expression. He effectively uses silence, unique behavior, metaphor, minimum speech, and beautiful music. These effects give deep impression.The three colors trilogy is the masterpiece of Kieslowski and consists of 3 films ("" Blue"", ""White"", and ""Red"" ) . The colors of French flag means liberty, equality, fraternity. Director Kieslowski expressed these themes through the movies.

The ""blue"" of the title shows up throughout; it's extraordinary how the film-makers integrate it into almost every shot. This is a movie where everything counts -- the photography, the music, the composition of the shots, the dialogue, the acting -- everything.Juliet Binoche gives a wonderfully restrained performance as a woman who loses her husband and small daughter in a horrible accident. She tries to kill herself but cannot go through with it so she rebuilds a new kind of life -- a life without connection, without purpose, empty. The movie deals with her slow realization that this kind of detachment is ultimately impossible. Slowly, she begins to reconnect -- to a prostitute who lives in her building, to her mother suffering from Alzheimers, to her husband's lover and finally to the man who loves her.This is a profound movie well worth watching and then thinking about.",5,Moving and visually rich,1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,941,"['1993', 'masterpiece', 'profound', 'meditation', 'loss', 'blue', 'title', 'up', 'extraordinary', 'how', 'film-makers', 'integrate', 'almost', 'shot', 'movie', 'where', 'everything', 'counts', 'photography', 'music', 'composition', 'shots', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'everything.Juliet', 'Binoche', 'wonderfully', 'restrained', 'performance', 'woman', 'who', 'husband', 'small', 'daughter', 'horrible', 'accident', 'kill', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'new', 'kind', 'life', 'life', 'connection', 'purpose', 'empty', 'movie', 'deals', 'slow', 'realization', 'kind', 'detachment', 'ultimately', 'impossible', 'Slowly', 'reconnect', 'prostitute', 'who', 'building', 'mother', 'suffering', 'Alzheimers', 'husband', 'lover', 'finally', 'man', 'who', 'her.This', 'profound', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'then', 'thinking']",N/A
361190,A4VH04TA14CPE,6303160344,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[12, 21]","Julie (Juliette Binoche) has just lost her husband and her little daughter in a car accident. She is emotionally shattered and withdraws into herself. Soon, we see her walking through her husband's mansion (he was a famous composer, and thus a wealthy man) and arranging to sell it. We see her sorrowful face in close-up. Several times she looks like she's about to cry. Then she steps outside, the camera zooms out, and we see that she is wearing stylish shoes with very high heels. In fact, her whole attire is very glamorous and fashionable.That's what Julie's suffering is like: glamorous and fashionable, for the entire duration of the film. Kieslowski is serious about Julie's emotions, he wants her sorrow to move the audience. But nonetheless that stylized glamour suffuses every single scene. Every day, Julie goes out and broods by herself, not just anywhere, but in a fashionable cafe, over coffee and ice cream, served in elegant glassware.She moves out of the mansion to an apartment in the city. Kieslowski means to suggest that this apartment is old and run-down, because the landlord says that it needs maintenance. But in the ensuing scenes, it looks stylish and expensive, full of tasteful furniture. Sometimes Julie chills out here in a chair. She stares ahead in mournful silence, but she doesn't forget to wear a chic sweater. Her apartment looks huge, by the way. If only I could find one of comparable size.At night, Julie goes swimming. She can't sleep from suffering too much, so she goes to a vast, gorgeous crystal blue pool and swims back and forth. In the daytime, sometimes she quietly suffers on a bench outside. One time, an old woman shuffles by and tries to deposit an empty bottle in a recycling bin. But because she's bent double from old age, she can't reach the opening to put the bottle inside. Julie observes this, closes her eyes, and basks in the sunlight. Heaven forfend that other people's suffering should distract her from her own.In another scene, some guy calls her and claims to have some ""important business."" Julie tersely answers, ""Nothing's important,"" thus expressing her sadness and alienation. As she holds the receiver with that mournful look on her face, we admire her trendy, fashionable androgynous hairstyle.Then, she suddenly finds that a mouse has made a nest in her closet. Julie sees that the mouse has babies, and feels sympathy. She broods over this matter for some time, then kills the mice anyway. But afterwards she feels really guilty, and even cries. A normal person would either kill the mice, or feel sorry for them and leave them alone, or kill them first and later come to regret it. But not our tortured heroine. She feels sorry for them first, but she has to kill them, just so she can feel and confess gnawing remorse.Needless to say, Julie has no job (a fact she proudly flaunts before the landlord), but of course it turns out that she's a brilliant musician, capable of easily finishing her husband's incomplete concerto. Her husband, by the way, was not just any old composer. He was working on a special concerto in honour of the unification of Europe. This work was supposed to be played in all the European capitals on the day of unification.This deliberately symbolic detail is the key to the film. Kieslowski loves Julie's elegance and wealth. He may not even want to emphasize it, but he can't help it, it's everywhere. And that's why the music is about, not just any old thing, but the unification of Europe. This is what unification means to Kieslowski -- a magical transformation after which everyone will become rich, dress fashionably and sit in expensive cafes, full of elegant and aesthetic melancholy. He desperately craves this wealthy elegance, and he wants us to admire it as well.Every aspect of the film is subordinate to this vision. The dialogue, for instance, is very heavily stylized. The characters don't talk, they make exhibitionistic declarative statements. Julie meets her husband's mistress, who is also elegant and beautiful. The following exchange takes place: ""Excuse me."" ""Yes."" ""You were my husband's mistress."" ""Yes."" Instantly they know each other, instantly they understand and soon they reconcile. I found myself thinking of Bergman's later films, where routine and convention make it impossible for characters to express themselves in such a straightforward manner, and anyone who tries finds the attempt very painful. But in Kieslowski's vision, the unification of Europe instantly removes such barriers along with all other problems.Juliette Binoche came to ""Blue"" not long after finishing ""Lovers On The Bridge"" with Leos Carax. In fact, Carax is also fond of stylized, glamorous romanticism, but his version of it is heedless and irrational, and frequently opposed to fashion and wealth. In his film ""Bad Blood,"" he occasionally cuts to a black screen for a moment, and then cuts back to the scene. Kieslowski plunders Carax's technique as well as his actress, but in his hands, the same technique is used as an overt signal to the audience that something important is happening. Where Carax's cuts last only a second, and occur more or less randomly in his film, Kieslowski makes them last longer, and adds sudden bursts of majestic violins, the better to illustrate that the moment is weighty with emotional significance. Unsurprisingly, Carax is widely viewed as a failure, and Kieslowski is lauded as a genius.""Blue"" combines elegant coldness and cheap sentimentality, both meant to induce narcissistic self-pity. First Julie throws away a copy of her late husband's unfinished masterwork, then she finds another copy and finishes it. There's no real difference between these two acts -- both serve to assert Julie's great importance. And underwriting the film's self-obsessed heroine is the director's passionate love for those elegant, beautiful, callous people who will inherit the world after unification.",1,Glamorous

361191,A1DOUKV8D3TTD5,6303160344,A. R. Greenlee,"[1, 1]","""Blue"" is like a dream: convincng and palpable, yet allusive and elusive.  The camera lingers on faces and scenes -- gorgeous and colorful -- at a melancholy and engaging pace, as suggestive elements come and go whose presence escapes immediate signification.  It's like watching ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Blowup"" together -- with elegnace and pathos added.Julie survives an auto accident in which her husband and daughter die.  The husband, we learn, had been working on a musical composition to celebrate the unification of Europe.  Julie is then asked to participate in the planned celebration, including the use of the musical composition.  She declines the invitation and destroys the music score.  The film moves on from there, showing us her reaction to her loss, to the music, and to other people, all of whom (or which) are somehow connected.  But how?In addition to the features already mentioned, other elements appear: a swimming pool (repeatedly); scenes of bungee jumping and tight-rope walking on tv; a cross on a necklace (twice); a street-performing musician (several times); baby mice (several times); a lover (or two); and an elderly, decrepit woman placing a glass bottle in a street-side depository -- a Parisian version of a portable recycling center.  What do they have to do with Julie's grief?The movie works on several levels.  As cinematography, it is lush and beautiful, fully engaging and mesmerizing, without sating.  As story, it unfolds like a mystery or dream, as from the inside, not from the outside, moving from point A to point Y, never quite arriving at Z.  As metaphor, its ""unnecessary"" details and suggestive connections beg for interpretation.The color blue in the French flag represents liberty, and the other two films in this trilogy deal with the other two colors, white for equality and red for fraternity. (Incidentally, July 14, the date of the storming of the Bastille, is France's equvalent of the American 4th of July, independence day.  The character's name is ""Julie."" In French, ""July"" is ""juillet."") So is the movie about liberty? And if so, what do loss and grief have to do with liberty?  Is the movie a metaphor for other issues?  Is it about political-economic, spiritual-metaphysical matters?  If it is a metaphor, it does not ""work"" at that level at the expense of telling the story of Julie.  No, Julie is front and center, and we never lose sight of her or the issues with which she struggles.  And this is what makes ""Blue"" so mesmerizng and so tantalizing -- and so effective.I saw the movie ""Red"" before I had seen the other two in the trilogy. After viewing it, I sat back, smiled, and thought, ""Wow!  I've got to see that again.""  And I did, but not before first renting and viewing ""White"" and then ""Blue,"" in that order.  What I did not know at the time is that I had viewed them in the reverse order of their production and release.  Each can be seen by itself, and the viewer will have a rewarding cinematic experience.  However, viewing them all, and in the order in which Kieslowski released them, enhances the overall effect and enriches the viewing of each.  The mystery does not diminish, the tantalization does not decrease, and the dreamlike quality keeps you coming back for more.  Such is the achievement of Kieslowski.PS  If you watch them all, you will notice certain recurring elements.  In each film, a courthouse figures prominently.  Why?  In each film, the green, street-side recycling bin is depicted.  Why?  In each film, a long-dead, fictitious composer named Budenmayer is featured.  Why?

So this movie a full expression of grief, as it's title Blue"" suggests.In this indescribable numbness and physical pain, is there anyone she could turn to? Her mother whom she sought to get some consolation had nothing to offer, as she herself is a victim of senile dementia faintly pointing out that as a child she was perfectly happy. Her nana instead wept and profusely too in a dark corner. Silently she gave her a hug and asked her why? Because you don't cry was the answer. ( It's somewhat like the  Heifetz, the violinist's playing, just like a tordado !! )She chanced into a promiscuous neighbour who also went to into a number of crisis. First the residents of the building were turning her out to be saved by her last vote. And then her father came as an viewer in one of her pornographic shows, whereas she had to resort to her late husband's colleague's physical comfort.Yes, she escaped into an estranged town, diving into the water, swimming what not. But history, or at least memories of history, was repeating itself.  The street flutist played her tune and one early morning she found him sick laying by the gutter. And the mouse having begot a host of youngs in her kitchen getting right into her nerves. She didn't have the heart to dispose of them as it reminds of her own fate so much. She tried to move again but in vain. Eventually a cat has to be introduced...  It was too much pain, self-inflicted or otherwise... These are all facets of her grief.Suddenly, she realised that she was not alone in her sufferings. She was kept so far in the dark that her husband had a lover, a young and pretty lawyer, even pregnant with his baby. So, she was not the only woman whom her husband loved. Jealousy, perhaps.  But out of her kindness and generosity, she gave part of her husband's estate to this future heir of her late husband. Perhaps the news came as a shock, perhaps she felt that she was no longer alone or at least not in her pain and hence her existence?  But this belated straw on the camel's back came and at last made her cry ...So her husband was an internationally acclaimed composer whom she assisted a lot.

361196,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,6303160344,Buenoslibros.es,"[0, 3]","Kieslowsky's films are not the most exciting thing one can spend his time watching. Of all directors I would compare him only to Russian artist Tarkovsky; in his style, not in his quality. One wishes his film would work; would grab our attention. Unfortunately, they just aren't as good as they look: they only pretend.In one of his interviews he leaves no doubt that he doesn't like pretentiousness at all. That is the last thing he wants so seem. But watching his films (Blue, especially) one understands why he took so much trouble to avoid this: his subjects, and his style, actually are pretentious, despite his (I believe) honest efforts to the contrary.Now let's see this 'Blue' story. The script plays a very secondary role here. Thes story is told by the facts that happen, simply. Then the viewer is supposed to get into the skin of the protagonist and see everything from her point of view: that is, identify with her. The viewer has to pretend being the woman in the story, like those things happened to you. In this case words become obstacles because people don't tell themselves how they feel, or what they do, they just feel and do. However, this is a film. The viewer is in his right to be a little more receptive, more passive, without being told how to feel or think either. If one just doesn't care enough about this woman... what are we to do? She has an accident? Well, I'm sorry. That's all the identification the film will get from me. After that, the particular reactions of this character don't have anything to do with me: that's her. And I can't pretend that it's me because I wouldn't be acting like her. If the director wants me to pretend to be her he is going to have to help me, and not assume that I can play 'pretending'. That's why this is a pretentious film; with honest intentions, but pretentious, and therefore boring.The fact that this film intends to represent 'liberty', the freedom that the woman unexpectedly finds after the terrible accident, sounds good enough; but it doesn't make the film good. Kieslowsky might as well have said it represented anything else, still it doesn't make it any better. This kind of cinema is a bit risky, because you can pick almost any simple plot, make it look mysterious or weird, not say actually anything and let the pseudo-intellectuals interpret it once you already stated its meaning: liberty, or whatever. Sounds much like post-modernist so-called art: They show you horse-dung and say it's art (and you believe it because otherwise it wouldn't be in a museum, right?)Still, this film is viewable and not too bad.",3,Pretentious despite all the efforts,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,2599,"['Kieslowsky', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'most', 'exciting', 'thing', 'one', 'can', 'spend', 'time', 'watching', 'directors', 'would', 'compare', 'only', 'Russian', 'artist', 'Tarkovsky', 'style', 'not', 'quality', 'One', 'film', 'would', 'work', 'would', 'grab', 'attention', 'Unfortunately', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'look', 'only', 'pretend.In', 'one', 'interviews', 'doubt', ""n't"", 'like', 'pretentiousness', 'last', 'thing', 'so', 'seem', 'watching', 'films', 'Blue', 'especially', 'one', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'avoid', 'subjects', 'style', 'actually', 'are', 'pretentious', 'believe', 'honest', 'efforts', 'contrary.Now', 'let', 'see', ""'Blue"", 'story', 'script', 'very', 'secondary', 'role', 'here', 'Thes', 'story', 'told', 'facts', 'happen', 'simply', 'Then', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'get', 'skin', 'protagonist', 'see', 'everything', 'point', 'view', 'identify', 'viewer', 'pretend', 'being', 'woman', 'story', 'things', 'happened', 'case', 'words', 'become', 'obstacles', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'feel', 'what', 'do', 'just', 'feel', 'do', 'However', 'film', 'viewer', 'right', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'receptive', 'more', 'passive', 'being', 'told', 'how', 'feel', 'think', 'either', 'one', 'just', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'woman', 'what', 'are', 'do', 'accident', 'Well', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'identification', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'particular', 'reactions', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'acting', 'director', 'pretend', 'be', 'going', 'have', 'help', 'not', 'assume', 'can', 'play', ""'pretending"", 'why', 'pretentious', 'film', 'honest', 'intentions', 'pretentious', 'therefore', 'boring.The', 'fact', 'film', 'represent', ""'liberty"", 'freedom', 'woman', 'unexpectedly', 'terrible', 'accident', 'good', 'enough', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'good', 'Kieslowsky', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'said', 'represented', 'anything', 'else', 'still', ""n't"", 'make', 'better', 'kind', 'cinema', 'bit', 'risky', 'can', 'pick', 'almost', 'simple', 'plot', 'make', 'look', 'mysterious', 'weird', 'not', 'say', 'actually', 'anything', 'let', 'pseudo-intellectuals', 'interpret', 'once', 'already', 'stated', 'meaning', 'liberty', 'much', 'post-modernist', 'so-called', 'art', 'show', 'horse-dung', 'say', 'art', 'believe', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'museum', 'right', 'Still', 'film', 'viewable', 'not', 'too', 'bad']",N/A

361198,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6303160344,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","This is a beautiful film with superb photography and acting, especially the brilliant performance of Juliette Binoche. The film begins with tragedy as the husband and 5 year old daughter of a young French woman are killed in a car accident. Julie (played by Binoche) is knocked unconscious and does not remember the accident or the deaths of her family members.  She is badly cut and bruised from the accident but she is overcome with grief, so much so that she attempts suicide, which she aborts.  The brilliance of the film is the depiction of a cold persona by Julie to contain the grief and to maintain her sanity in the face of such loss. Upon release from the hospital she does about the careful work of destroying all the manuscripts remaining of her husband's orchestral compositions as well as most of the remaining aspects and objects of her family life prior to the accident.  Her grief is so great and her hold on sanity so slim that she feels she must destroy every reminder of her life before. We are given an odd clue at this point in the film when a television talk-show personality invades her privacy and asks if the rumor is true that Julie composed her husband's symphonies? We now begin to get a sense of why the tragic passages of her husband's last symphony keep sounding in her head. Are they coming to her because they are her own unfinished works or are they coming to her because of her memories of her husband or are they coming to her because their tragic sound is trying to get her to release her grief?  She puts the family cook and gardener on retainer and puts the family country mansion up for sale. She moves into a top floor apartment in a Paris neighborhood where she thinks no one can find her or recognize her and in which she can disappear from the world. She does keep a ceiling lamp of blue beads from her daughter's bedroom and this item becomes somewhat of a passage as her former life catches up with her gradually, at a pace she is able to absorb. Julie perceives that her husband's friend and colleague, Olivier, has a secret desire for her and she asks him to come to her. They make love, but Julie has no intention of opening herself to pain again and she leaves Olivier. She appears to have needed a night of sexual comfort but with no intention of beginning to live again in relationship with others. This is not true of Olivier who has secretly retained some of her husband's last manuscripts and photographs from his working desk.Julie can not disappear from life for life has a funny way of creeping back. Primarily it is through compassion for others that healing begins for Julie. This reminded me of the excellent film, All About My Mother, where it is compassion for the pain of others that eventually is the path by which our own grief begins to melt. A series of odd events begins to pull Julie back into the world, including her gentle supportive acceptance of a young prostitute; conversations with her mentally frail elderly mother; daily swims in a blue pool, and a confrontation with a mother mouse and baby mice. By telling her mother about the deaths of her child and husband, she is finally able to speak the horror she has experienced. By swimming in the pool, she can finally cry. By putting a cat into her apartment, she is able to separate her loss of her daughter from the need to get the rats out of the pantry. This film is exceptional in the careful and patient manner in which it depicts the healing process after great personal loss. In folk tales, it is often a weak character or small animal that leads the lost hero out of the wilderness. They young prostitute who lives in her apartment building plays this role. While responding to a call from help from the young prostitute neighbor, Julie sees a television show with photographs of her husband with his mistress, Sandrine. She searchers for Sandrine and finds her 9 months pregnant. Her bond with Sandrine is full of compassion at their mutual loss and she begins to think about what her husband would have wanted for his new child.The film is beautiful at many levels. The settings and photography are superb and the acting is of the highest quality. Binoche gives a performance that is intelligent, natural, sensitive, and moving. The use of imagery, such as the blue pool in a dark gymnasium, evoked images of baptism and healing each time that Julie emerges. Water is often a symbol of the unconscious, and it is healing at an unconscious level that is also required when a great loss has occurred. The film is outstanding and highly recommended. It is one of the best depictions of the healing process around grief captured on film. The beauty of the production makes this topic soar.",5,"Grief and loss explored with mystery, grace, and compassion",1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,4724,"['beautiful', 'film', 'superb', 'photography', 'acting', 'especially', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'film', 'tragedy', 'husband', '5', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'young', 'French', 'woman', 'are', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'Julie', 'played', 'Binoche', 'knocked', 'unconscious', 'not', 'remember', 'accident', 'deaths', 'family', 'members', 'badly', 'cut', 'bruised', 'accident', 'overcome', 'grief', 'so', 'much', 'suicide', 'brilliance', 'film', 'depiction', 'cold', 'persona', 'Julie', 'contain', 'grief', 'maintain', 'sanity', 'face', 'such', 'loss', 'release', 'hospital', 'careful', 'work', 'destroying', 'manuscripts', 'remaining', 'husband', 'orchestral', 'compositions', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'remaining', 'aspects', 'objects', 'family', 'life', 'prior', 'accident', 'grief', 'so', 'great', 'hold', 'sanity', 'so', 'slim', 'must', 'destroy', 'reminder', 'life', 'are', 'given', 'odd', 'clue', 'point', 'film', 'when', 'television', 'talk-show', 'personality', 'privacy', 'rumor', 'true', 'Julie', 'composed', 'husband', 'symphonies', 'now', 'begin', 'get', 'sense', 'why', 'tragic', 'passages', 'husband', 'last', 'symphony', 'keep', 'sounding', 'head', 'Are', 'coming', 'are', 'own', 'unfinished', 'works', 'are', 'coming', 'memories', 'husband', 'are', 'coming', 'tragic', 'sound', 'trying', 'get', 'release', 'grief', 'family', 'cook', 'gardener', 'retainer', 'family', 'country', 'mansion', 'sale', 'top', 'floor', 'apartment', 'Paris', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'recognize', 'can', 'disappear', 'world', 'keep', 'ceiling', 'lamp', 'blue', 'beads', 'daughter', 'bedroom', 'item', 'somewhat', 'passage', 'former', 'life', 'catches', 'up', 'gradually', 'pace', 'able', 'absorb', 'Julie', 'husband', 'friend', 'colleague', 'Olivier', 'secret', 'desire', 'come', 'make', 'love', 'Julie', 'intention', 'opening', 'pain', 'again', 'Olivier', 'have', 'needed', 'night', 'sexual', 'comfort', 'intention', 'beginning', 'live', 'again', 'relationship', 'others', 'not', 'true', 'Olivier', 'who', 'secretly', 'retained', 'husband', 'last', 'manuscripts', 'photographs', 'working', 'desk.Julie', 'can', 'not', 'disappear', 'life', 'life', 'funny', 'way', 'creeping', 'back', 'Primarily', 'compassion', 'others', 'healing', 'begins', 'Julie', 'reminded', 'excellent', 'film', 'My', 'Mother', 'where', 'compassion', 'pain', 'others', 'eventually', 'path', 'own', 'grief', 'melt', 'series', 'odd', 'events', 'pull', 'Julie', 'back', 'world', 'including', 'gentle', 'supportive', 'acceptance', 'young', 'prostitute', 'conversations', 'mentally', 'frail', 'elderly', 'mother', 'daily', 'swims', 'blue', 'pool', 'confrontation', 'mother', 'mouse', 'baby', 'mice', 'telling', 'mother', 'deaths', 'child', 'husband', 'finally', 'able', 'speak', 'horror', 'experienced', 'swimming', 'pool', 'can', 'finally', 'cry', 'putting', 'cat', 'apartment', 'able', 'separate', 'loss', 'daughter', 'need', 'get', 'rats', 'pantry', 'film', 'exceptional', 'careful', 'patient', 'manner', 'healing', 'process', 'great', 'personal', 'loss', 'folk', 'tales', 'often', 'weak', 'character', 'small', 'animal', 'lost', 'hero', 'wilderness', 'young', 'prostitute', 'who', 'apartment', 'building', 'role', 'responding', 'call', 'help', 'young', 'prostitute', 'neighbor', 'Julie', 'television', 'show', 'photographs', 'husband', 'mistress', 'Sandrine', 'Sandrine', '9', 'months', 'pregnant', 'bond', 'Sandrine', 'full', 'compassion', 'mutual', 'loss', 'think', 'what', 'husband', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'new', 'child.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'many', 'levels', 'settings', 'photography', 'are', 'superb', 'acting', 'highest', 'quality', 'Binoche', 'performance', 'intelligent', 'natural', 'sensitive', 'moving', 'use', 'imagery', 'such', 'blue', 'pool', 'dark', 'gymnasium', 'evoked', 'images', 'baptism', 'healing', 'time', 'Julie', 'Water', 'often', 'symbol', 'unconscious', 'healing', 'unconscious', 'level', 'also', 'required', 'when', 'great', 'loss', 'occurred', 'film', 'outstanding', 'highly', 'recommended', 'one', 'best', 'depictions', 'healing', 'process', 'grief', 'captured', 'film', 'beauty', 'production', 'topic', 'soar']",N/A

There is really very little dialogue.  Many close-ups of Binoche's face.  First in a trilogy of the colors in the French flag - blue stands for liberty.  She is now free of all family ties, but what has she got?  Nothing.  There is the quote from St. Paul flashing across the screen, ""And if I do not have love, I am nothing.""  There are a great many blank places of film, with only music in the soundtrack, as if the director were suggesting that Julie was cutting out of life or resisting or merely blanking out for a second.

On the other hand, most movies so obviously dealing with loss as a major theme have never touched me strongly. I'm always aware that I'm watching a movie. And in this case, I had conflicted feelings about Julie. I understand someone feeling a personal loss so greatly that he or she simply wants to retreat from everything. But at least half or more of the movie was about this emotional retreat. I began to want to shake her and say, ""Get on with your life."" There comes a time when sadness can become simply self indulgent. I also had difficulty finding an emotional bond with her. Discarding her husband's last manuscript, described as ""so beautiful,"" could be an act of emotional desolation, but it also is an act --within a movie -- of high vandalism. A person may be frightened of mice, in Julie's case more likely frightened of the sense of motherhood and dependence, but bringing a cat to kill and eat the mother mouse and her babies is an act of someone, however troubled, I wouldn't want to know. That she is distraught later helps me with her, but it doesn't do much for the mice.The movie is made up of so many sequences that, for me, don't build much resonance concerning Julie because, well, there are so many sequences. The emotionless love making with Olivier, the beggar with the flute, the situation with the prostitute in her apartment building, the young man bringing her the necklace, the old lady with the bottle, and so on. These and the other sequences are all masterfully done, but for me there are just too many of them dealing with Julie's frozen emotional state. Only when she begins to come out of it, when she invites her pregnant husband's mistress to the country house, helps the prostitute who sees her father in the audience, and then begins to help Olivier to finish the score...and agrees to jointly take credit with him and her husband, does the movie begin to pick up the pace. I know one can say that her emotional death is being shown by the slowness and ambiguity of the first two-thirds of the movie. Nonetheless, I think it was too much, at least for the story being told. However, for a movie being shown, it kept me watching. The use of brief blackouts to represent her emotional blackouts was absolutely masterful. I'd never seen it before. The ending, however, I felt was a little self conscious. Trying to bring all the people whom Julie had encountered, even briefly, into one big canvas to close the movie just seemed pushing it. On balance, as much as I liked much of the movie, I just couldn't escape the feeling every so often of, ""Hey, look what Kieslowski's doing now.""We all bring our own baggage to the movies we see and the books we read. These are comments from a person who has only seen the movie once, who can come close to crying if a dog is killed, but who sometimes gets impatient with a movie which deals with the emotional crises of intelligent and capable people.",4,"Beautiful, Sad And Perhaps Too Much So",1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,3075,"[""'m"", 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'dealing', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'think', 'technically', 'masterfully', 'directed', 'film', 'kept', 'watching', 'other', 'hand', 'most', 'movies', 'so', 'obviously', 'dealing', 'loss', 'major', 'theme', 'have', 'never', 'touched', 'strongly', ""'m"", 'always', 'aware', ""'m"", 'watching', 'movie', 'case', 'had', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'Julie', 'understand', 'someone', 'feeling', 'personal', 'loss', 'so', 'greatly', 'simply', 'retreat', 'everything', 'least', 'half', 'more', 'movie', 'was', 'emotional', 'retreat', 'began', 'want', 'shake', 'say', 'Get', 'life', 'time', 'when', 'sadness', 'can', 'become', 'simply', 'self', 'indulgent', 'also', 'had', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'emotional', 'bond', 'Discarding', 'husband', 'last', 'manuscript', 'described', 'so', 'beautiful', 'could', 'be', 'act', 'emotional', 'desolation', 'also', 'act', 'movie', 'high', 'vandalism', 'person', 'may', 'be', 'frightened', 'mice', 'Julie', 'case', 'more', 'likely', 'frightened', 'sense', 'motherhood', 'dependence', 'bringing', 'cat', 'kill', 'eat', 'mother', 'mouse', 'babies', 'act', 'someone', 'however', 'troubled', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'distraught', 'later', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'mice.The', 'movie', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'sequences', 'do', ""n't"", 'build', 'much', 'resonance', 'concerning', 'Julie', 'well', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'sequences', 'emotionless', 'love', 'making', 'Olivier', 'beggar', 'flute', 'situation', 'prostitute', 'apartment', 'building', 'young', 'man', 'bringing', 'necklace', 'old', 'lady', 'bottle', 'so', 'other', 'sequences', 'are', 'masterfully', 'done', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'dealing', 'Julie', 'frozen', 'emotional', 'state', 'Only', 'when', 'come', 'when', 'pregnant', 'husband', 'mistress', 'country', 'house', 'prostitute', 'who', 'father', 'audience', 'then', 'help', 'Olivier', 'finish', 'score', 'jointly', 'take', 'credit', 'husband', 'movie', 'begin', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'know', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'emotional', 'death', 'being', 'shown', 'slowness', 'ambiguity', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'Nonetheless', 'think', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'least', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'However', 'movie', 'being', 'shown', 'kept', 'watching', 'use', 'brief', 'blackouts', 'represent', 'emotional', 'blackouts', 'was', 'absolutely', 'masterful', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'ending', 'however', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'self', 'conscious', 'Trying', 'bring', 'people', 'whom', 'Julie', 'had', 'encountered', 'even', 'briefly', 'one', 'big', 'canvas', 'close', 'movie', 'just', 'seemed', 'pushing', 'balance', 'as', 'much', 'liked', 'much', 'movie', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'escape', 'feeling', 'so', 'often', 'Hey', 'look', 'what', 'Kieslowski', 'doing', 'now', 'bring', 'own', 'baggage', 'movies', 'see', 'books', 'read', 'are', 'comments', 'person', 'who', 'only', 'seen', 'movie', 'once', 'who', 'can', 'come', 'close', 'crying', 'dog', 'killed', 'who', 'sometimes', 'impatient', 'movie', 'emotional', 'crises', 'intelligent', 'capable', 'people']",N/A

361202,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6303160344,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 1]","Krzysztof Kieslowski was one of the more interesting filmmakers of the last quarter century, and the centerpiece of his claim to greatness is the Three Colors (Trois Couleurs) trilogy of films that he wrote and directed in the early to mid-1990s, filming them all at the same time. Blue, White, and Red represent the three colors of the French flag, and symbolize the three virtues of liberty, equality, and fraternity respectively. Blue (Bleu) is the first film in the series, and was released in 1993. The color blue also resonates for its associations with depression and coldness, that are well demonstrated in the film. It was deserving of the many award sit garnered, such as winning Best Film at the Venice Film Festival and the Goya Awards, as well as star Juliette Binoche (who looks like a prettier Julia Roberts, as well as a better actress) winning Best Actress at Venice and the Cesar Awards.Yet, Kieslowski made a wise choice to depoliticize his films, for the freedom that Blue deals with is not political but personal and emotional- a hoped for freedom from memories, and not the cheap sort that Hollywood would foist, such as a woman running away from an abusive boyfriend. If only more artists (think Latin American writers) could learn that political statements can be made slyly and subtly and wield far more power than overt preaching. Another wise move he made was to cast this film as a picaresque, whose main character is delineated in small strokes, with scenes that do not drive simple plot not character development, but stand alone and apart as merely defining her state of mind.The film starts with an automobile accident that kills off a husband and father, the famous musical composer Patrice de Courcy, and his five year old daughter Anna. The only survivor is his wife, named Julie de Courcy ne&eacute; Vignon (Juliette Binoche). This is foreshadowed when we see a shot of leaking brake fluid from the car when the daughter is let off the side of the road to urinate. Fortunately, the crash occurs off camera, not in the melodramatic style a Hollywood film would drool over. Interestingly, at the end of the film, after the credits, Kieslowski has a sly tweak when he notes that, since the car is an Alfa Romeo, any loss of brake fluid, and the accident, are purely fictional events. When Julie wakes in a hospital we see an extreme close up of her pupil reflecting the image of her doctor. It is an objective shot of subjectivity after Julie regains her consciousness after an unspecified period of time. This ellipsis of death to the opened eye has a great psychic resonance to the viewer, in a way mere words cannot. She recovers, after a fey attempt at suicide by overdose at her hospital, and decides to abandon her country estate and set out for an anonymous life in Paris. In one scene, Julie comes upon her old maid who is crying.  She asks, `Why are you crying?' The maid answers, `I am crying because you are not.' The rest of the plot has been detailed by others.I started this review by stating that Krzysztof Kieslowski was one of the more interesting filmmakers of the last quarter century, and I stand by that claim. The only thing a viewing of this film will add to that claim is to append the term great to that description, for Blue is a flat-out masterpiece. It is as mysterious as a work of Antonioni, symbolic as a film of Bergman, humane as a work of Fellini, and precise as a work of Kubrick.

Hamlow,"[1, 1]","The first of Kryzysztof Kieslowski's colour-titled films based on the French tricoleur flag and also from the French Revolutionary concept of Liberte, Egalite, et Fraternite, is Bleu.Julie de Courcy has survived an automobile accident that has taken the life of her husband, a renowned contemporary composer, and five year-old daughter Anna.  Uncertain and abandoned, she is determined to make a new start for herself, leaving behind traces of the past, especially as it turns out she was the one writing the music for her husband's compositions.  When I say survived, maybe I mean physically.  Emotionally and spiritually, she may as well have been a casualty.Leaving her large countryside mansion, she rents a spacious apartment in Paris.  It is more than just her past she is leaving.  She is also getting away from Olivier, a colleague of her late husband who has been in love with her all these years.  However, despite her attempts to remain an anonymous nonentity, some loose threads from her past need to be tied up.  Her husband Patrice was working on a concerto, the anthem for the European Union, which is Beethovenesque given some strong strings and a chorale.  A young man who witnessed the accident tracks also tracks her down.  And later, she learns that her husband had a mistress, and after learning from Olivier that he knew, decides to confront the woman.  The past also goes deep into a fear for rats that infest her apartment.Her attempt at noninvolvement also fails.  When a neighbour tries to get her to sign a petition demanding the eviction of a tenant, a loose woman, Julie refuses saying it's not her business.  Later, the woman, Lucille, arrives at Julie's flat with flowers, joyful that because not all the tenants signed, she is allowed to stay in the apartment building.  Julie later discovers Lucille works at a strip club.  When asked why she does it, Lucille says she likes it and everybody does.  The garish though briefly seen club scenes are a diametric opposite to what Julie's trying to achieve through her gloomy solitude.The theme of blue can be seen whenever Julie goes to the swimming pool.  The pool's bottom is reflected blue from the lights, symbolizing Julie's attempt to reenergize herself in her newfound liberation. Yet the implication here is that despite achieving liberty, or being Blue, one does so at the cost of destroying one's soul.  The liberty might as well be as hollow as the glass or crystal as those of the chandelier ornament Julie takes with her.  Sure it's pretty, but so what?  Is it spiritually or emotionally nourishing?  Or the blue lollipop wrapped in the blue Julie crunches down forcefully.  It seems equivalent to forcing liberty by the throat instead of making it a comfortable blanket.As Julie, Juliette Binoche turns in what's one of her best roles ever alongside her roles in The Unbearable Lightness of Being and The English Patient.  She isn't a grieving widow, but one who has decided to go through her life and tying up her past in her own way.  I give this 4.3 stars, rounded down and not a 5 because of Red, which I liked the best.  But I like this deeper shade of blue.  Benoit Regent gives credible support as her tempered yearner, Olivier.  Charlotte Very also stands out as Lucille.  And that's Emmanuelle Riva (Hiroshima Mon Amour) as Julie's senility-ridden mother.The story was also written by famed Polish director Agnieszka Holland, the woman behind Europa Europa.

361204,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,6303160344,darragh o'donoghue,"[0, 4]","'Three Colours Blue' is one of the most celebrated films we have about grief and the fall-out from family tragedy.  Significantly, Kieslowski only briefly and fragmentedly shows us the family life that is lost - the film begins with an inhuman, almost abstract montage of sound and image: underneath a speeding car as loud and fast as an airplane; the viewpoint of a young girl looking out the back window as the motorway tunnel trailing behind morphs into liquid shapes; a roadside stop-off again filmed from below, this time behind an open door, the human agents blocked out or blurred.  This is a family already alienated from one another, with less identity than the Fate that hangs over them.  Of the two characters whose view we get to share, one is killed off (the girl), the second is a bystanding witness to the car crash that screeches with a shock, but had been prepared for by a tension we could feel, but not understand.This distance from human interaction in the first sequence sets the pattern for the film as a whole, as Julie comes to terms with her loss, tries to block off the outside world and her past, rejects a lover, discovers unwelcome secrets about her composer husband's private life, and tries to destroy the music that she may have written.  The film's tremulous tension derives from two conflicting narrative strategies - on the one hand we are kept at a distance from the heroine; on the other, everything we see is what she focuses on - we are literally (claustrophobically) in her head.  Distance is maintained, not only by Juliette Binoche's very private, often expressionless performance, but by a mise-en-scene that keeps blocking her off from us, framing her through glass or decor, catching her in a staggered perspective of frames-within-frames.  Like the characters, we fail to comprehend what she's thinking (the central enigma - did she write her husband's music - and how she understands it, obviously limits our experience of her mindset), not helped by a story that emphasises privileged, pregnant, obscure moments rather than a coherent narrative.  But it is in those moments that we share Julie's sensibility - the blue filter that bathes the entire film; the breaches in editing rhythm (especially the slightly bathetic Godardian fades to black within shots to underline 'significant' moments); the optical tricks (from her first appearance in the film, simply a quavering eye reflecting a doctor informing her of the tragedy, to various patterns, distortions and blurs imposed on the frame); to the relentless close-ups on seemingly insignificant objects that are subject to Julie's intense attention; to the blaring of music and the heightening of ambient sound; to the distension of narrative time, wholly subordinated to subjectivity.As is approprate for a film about a composer, 'Blue' is patterned according to various thematic and visual motifs that recur, develop and transform throughout the work (for instance, the TV watched in disparate rooms; or the many women of varying ages and classes; or the use of the colour blue itself).When these films first came out, I was a fervid teenager eagerly awaiting Kieslowski's visions like Moses on Mount Sinai.  Now, I find something a little spurious about 'Blue', something synthetic and academic (this may have something to do with the DVD transfer - Kieslowski's sensual-spiritual aesthetic doesn't translate well to digital), as if the extraordinary technical command, virtuosic style and narrative euphoria utilised by the director is somehow a mannered evasion of true feeling.  In fairness, he does leave open the possibility that the entire film is a hospital hallucination (those framing extreme close-ups of Julie's eyes), and surely I am not alone in finding her lovemaking behind glass closer to Dante than harmony.  In the DVD available in Britain, respected 'Cahiers Du Cinema' critic Serge Toubiana compares the famous last montage of this film to 'The Passion Of Joan Of Arc'.  It is certainly striking (if bombastic), but I don't think so; 'Blue' is to Dreyer what Plexiglas is to granite.

The film deals with a young widow coping with not only the loss of her husband but her child as well.  The film essentially examines how we comport ourselves in the face of great personal tragedy.  We don't necessarily agree with the choices that Julie(Juliette Binoche) makes but they're certainly understandable.  There is no handbook for grief and some of us try to insulate ourselves from the past just to survive day to day.  Personally, I can relate to Julie because I have a sister who lost a husband at a young age and at the time I found some of her behavior inexplicable.  Binoche gives a carefully modulated performance that doesn't overplay the film's more dramatic elements.

361206,AE12AEJFCOGGY,6303160344,"David Montgomery ""Book Critic""","[83, 85]","&quot;Blue&quot; is the first film in Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Three Colors"" trilogy that examines life in contemporary European society. Each of the three films corresponds to a color in the French flag and a segment  of the French national motto. They are &quot;Blue&quot; (libert&eacute;),  &quot;White&quot; (egalit&eacute;) and &quot;Red&quot; (fraternit&eacute;).The theme  of liberty runs throughout &quot;Blue,&quot; but it is a cruel, unwelcome  liberty. The husband and daughter of Julie (Juliet Binoche), a young French  woman, are killed in a car accident at the beginning of the film. She, of  course, is devastated. She briefly considers suicide, but is unable to go  through with it. That would take an intensity of emotion-grief, loss,  despair, something-that she simply does not have. She is so cold inside  that she can feel nothing at all, not even sadness. (Blue, after all, is  the coldest color of the spectrum.) In one telling scene, Julie comes upon  her housekeeper who is weeping profusely. ""Why are you crying?,"" she asks  her. ""I am crying,"" the maid replies, ""because you are not.""Julie  decides that her only course of action is to free herself completely from  her past. She sells her house and all of her possessions and moves to an  apartment in Paris where she knows no one and no one knows her. The only  thing she keeps is her daughter's blue bead lamp, a colorful focal point in  her drab, spartan quarters, and the only reminder of her lost  life.Before she can leave, though, Julie must give herself one final  test. She seduces Olivier (Benoit Regent), a rather dull former colleague  of her husband's who, not incidentally, is in love with her. They make love  on a solitary mattress in her empty house, but she feels nothing. Perhaps  she really is incapable of love. Having confirmed her suspicion, she walks  away without even a backward glance.Julie's disappearance, however, is  difficult. Her late husband was a famous composer and they both remain the  subject of media interest and gossip. It is rumored that Julie actually  wrote his music herself, and it is true that the sounds of his last,  unfinished work haunt her throughout the film. No matter where she goes,  she cannot escape his (or is it her?) music because it lives within her  mind and her soul. Occasionally the action is stopped completely and the  screen fades to black, accompanied by the fortissimo sounds of his last,  farewell concerto. It is an interesting, risky device, but it works well in  conveying the dislocation, the sense of forever being apart from others,  that Julie feels.In the most interesting twist in the film, Julie meets  her late husband's mistress, Sandrine, (Florence Pernel), a woman she did  not even know existed. Sandrine is pregnant with his baby, a shocking  revelation, but Julie does not hate her for it. Rather, she is remarkably  generous and kind, just as he had always promised Sandrine she was. All  Julie wants to know is, ""Did he love you?"" She answers her own question,  though, when she spots the cross hanging from Sandrine's neck, the same  beloved gift her husband gave to her.Kieslowski takes his time in  telling his story. Things do not happen quickly, nor are events momentous  when they occur. The pacing is slow and languorous, but certainly never  boring. Unlike most movies made today, this is a quiet, subtle film.  Kieslowski and his cinematographer do a lot with the lighting, particularly  in the scenes in the swimming pool. Those shots are awash in soft,  evocative blue hues that give the scenes an exquisite, dream-like  feel.The performances by all of the leads are splendid. Juliette Binoche  is truly a marvelous actress. She was so good in Godard's &quot;Hail  Mary&quot; and Malle's &quot;Damage,&quot; and she is even better here. Her  character does not say much, nor does she take much dramatic action. Most  of what we learn about her comes from staring into her sad eyes and  regarding her troubled face. She is able to convey so much, not with broad  strokes or grand gestures, but with intricate nuances and careful  expressions. It is a performance to treasure.As I watched  &quot;Blue,&quot; I was reminded of another excellent French production,  &quot;Un Coeur en Hiver,&quot; that also dealt with painful music and the  tragedy of a cold, unfeeling heart. The similarities are subtle, but I  think both of these films demonstrate one quality sorely lacking in most  Hollywood pictures: maturity. The average major studio release is targeted  at the core demographic of 14 to 24 year old males, not exactly the most  discerning audience around. This strategy results in a lot of dreadful  films being made. Fortunately for those of us with a more highly developed  aesthetic sense, there are films like &quot;Blue&quot; around to satisfy  our longings.",4,Blue Can Be Beautiful,959212800,"05 25, 2000",2000,4848,"['quot', 'Blue', 'quot', 'first', 'film', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'Three', 'Colors', 'trilogy', 'life', 'contemporary', 'European', 'society', 'three', 'films', 'color', 'French', 'flag', 'segment', 'French', 'national', 'motto', 'are', 'quot', 'Blue', 'quot', 'libert', 'eacute', 'quot', 'White', 'quot', 'egalit', 'eacute', 'quot', 'Red', 'quot', 'fraternit', 'eacute', '.The', 'theme', 'liberty', 'runs', 'quot', 'Blue', 'quot', 'cruel', 'unwelcome', 'liberty', 'husband', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'Juliet', 'Binoche', 'young', 'French', 'woman', 'are', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'beginning', 'film', 'course', 'devastated', 'briefly', 'considers', 'suicide', 'unable', 'go', 'would', 'take', 'intensity', 'emotion-grief', 'loss', 'despair', 'something-that', 'simply', 'not', 'have', 'so', 'cold', 'can', 'feel', 'nothing', 'not', 'even', 'sadness', 'Blue', 'coldest', 'color', 'spectrum', 'one', 'telling', 'scene', 'Julie', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'weeping', 'profusely', 'Why', 'are', 'crying', 'am', 'crying', 'maid', 'replies', 'are', 'not', 'Julie', 'only', 'course', 'action', 'free', 'completely', 'past', 'house', 'possessions', 'moves', 'apartment', 'Paris', 'where', 'one', 'one', 'only', 'thing', 'daughter', 'blue', 'bead', 'lamp', 'colorful', 'focal', 'point', 'drab', 'spartan', 'quarters', 'only', 'reminder', 'lost', 'can', 'leave', 'Julie', 'must', 'give', 'one', 'final', 'test', 'Olivier', 'Benoit', 'Regent', 'rather', 'dull', 'former', 'colleague', 'husband', 'who', 'not', 'incidentally', 'love', 'make', 'love', 'solitary', 'mattress', 'empty', 'house', 'nothing', 'Perhaps', 'really', 'incapable', 'love', 'Having', 'confirmed', 'suspicion', 'away', 'even', 'backward', 'glance.Julie', 'disappearance', 'however', 'difficult', 'late', 'husband', 'was', 'famous', 'composer', 'remain', 'subject', 'media', 'interest', 'gossip', 'rumored', 'Julie', 'actually', 'wrote', 'music', 'true', 'sounds', 'last', 'unfinished', 'work', 'haunt', 'film', 'matter', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'music', 'mind', 'soul', 'Occasionally', 'action', 'stopped', 'completely', 'screen', 'black', 'accompanied', 'fortissimo', 'sounds', 'last', 'farewell', 'concerto', 'interesting', 'risky', 'device', 'well', 'conveying', 'dislocation', 'sense', 'forever', 'being', 'apart', 'others', 'Julie', 'feels.In', 'most', 'interesting', 'twist', 'film', 'Julie', 'late', 'husband', 'mistress', 'Sandrine', 'Florence', 'Pernel', 'woman', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'existed', 'Sandrine', 'pregnant', 'baby', 'shocking', 'revelation', 'Julie', 'not', 'hate', 'remarkably', 'generous', 'kind', 'just', 'had', 'always', 'promised', 'Sandrine', 'was', 'Julie', 'know', 'Did', 'love', 'own', 'question', 'though', 'when', 'spots', 'cross', 'hanging', 'Sandrine', 'neck', 'same', 'beloved', 'gift', 'husband', 'gave', 'her.Kieslowski', 'time', 'telling', 'story', 'Things', 'do', 'not', 'happen', 'quickly', 'are', 'events', 'momentous', 'when', 'occur', 'pacing', 'slow', 'languorous', 'certainly', 'never', 'boring', 'most', 'movies', 'made', 'today', 'quiet', 'subtle', 'film', 'Kieslowski', 'cinematographer', 'do', 'lot', 'lighting', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'swimming', 'pool', 'shots', 'are', 'awash', 'soft', 'evocative', 'blue', 'hues', 'give', 'scenes', 'exquisite', 'dream-like', 'feel.The', 'performances', 'leads', 'are', 'splendid', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'truly', 'marvelous', 'actress', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'Godard', 'quot', 'Hail', 'Mary', 'quot', 'Malle', 'quot', 'Damage', 'quot', 'even', 'better', 'here', 'character', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'take', 'much', 'dramatic', 'action', 'Most', 'what', 'learn', 'staring', 'sad', 'eyes', 'regarding', 'troubled', 'face', 'able', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'broad', 'strokes', 'grand', 'gestures', 'intricate', 'nuances', 'careful', 'expressions', 'performance', 'treasure.As', 'watched', 'quot', 'Blue', 'quot', 'was', 'reminded', 'excellent', 'French', 'production', 'quot', 'Un', 'Coeur', 'en', 'Hiver', 'quot', 'also', 'painful', 'music', 'tragedy', 'cold', 'unfeeling', 'heart', 'similarities', 'are', 'subtle', 'think', 'films', 'demonstrate', 'one', 'quality', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'pictures', 'maturity', 'average', 'major', 'studio', 'release', 'targeted', 'core', 'demographic', '14', '24', 'year', 'old', 'males', 'not', 'exactly', 'most', 'discerning', 'audience', 'around', 'strategy', 'results', 'lot', 'dreadful', 'films', 'being', 'made', 'Fortunately', 'more', 'highly', 'developed', 'aesthetic', 'sense', 'are', 'films', 'quot', 'Blue', 'quot', 'satisfy', 'longings']",N/A

She retreats within herself . . . wanting nothing more to live without attachments, friends or lovers. At first she succeeds, but life has a funny way of pulling us back into the thick of it. It's astounding how much feeling and emotion is transmitted by this film without dialogue. The symbolism of life is everywhere; Julie is bombarded by it. Take the example of the symbolism of the aged bungy jumper or tightrope walker on her mother's tv screen. The symbolic subplot of the aged woman trying to place the bottle into the trash is introduced, but, in Blue, Julie closes her eyes to the scene. Blue is the story of our interior emotions and how people can fold into themselves. The symbolic subplot of the musical score works well because it reveals Julie's emotional state: at first, she tries to destroy the music, then hears it played by a street flutist, and, in the end, she works on the score . . . symbolizing her character's change. Her inner state is also revealed by the beautifully filmed swimming pool scenes.

And &quot;Blue&quot; (&quot;Bleu&quot;) is the first film in the celebrated Colors trilogy by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Accompanying the rich &quot;Red&quot; (&quot;Rouge&quot;) and sharp &quot;White&quot; (&quot;Blanc&quot;), this is a beautiful and haunting look at grief and getting past it.Julie de Courcy (Juliette Binoche) and her family are in a car accident when their brakes fail. Julie is injured, but her composer husband and their daughter die. She can't bring herself to commit suicide, but neither can she just go home and get over it. So instead she leaves her palatial house in the country after a night with her husband's old friend Olivier (Benot R&eacute;gent), who has been in love with her for years.Julie arrives in Paris with nothing but a blue cut-glass lampshade, takes back her maiden name, rents an apartment, and tries to leave her old life behind. Though she says she doesn't want love or friends (because they are &quot;traps&quot;), she befriends a promiscuous young woman and is pulled back to Olivier when he starts to finish her husband's unfinished work. In turn, Olivier reveals to her the side of her husband she never knew -- the other woman he loved.The Colors trilogy is based on the colors of the French flag: Blue, white and red, standing respectively for liberty, equality, and fraternity. In this, Julie is unconsciously seeking liberty from her past life and her grief. This grief is shown beyond mere tears and unhappiness. She rakes her knuckles over a rough wall, rips off a strand off the hanging lampshade, as little ways of showing her inner turmoil. At the same time, the revelations about Julie's husband raises questions about their marriage and about Julie herself.The powerful music celebrating the EU pops up periodically, often when Julie experiences strong emotion. At times, the screen goes dark, and the overwhelming, soaring symphony is all you can detect. And as Kieslowski does in &quot;White&quot; and &quot;Red,&quot; this film is sprinkled with color and symbolism. Blue crops up in little dancing bars of light on Julie's face, in her clothing, a swimming pool, in rain-slicked windows, a misty blue morning and a lollipop.This may be Binoche's best performance. Her expressive eyes and subtle facial expressions convey every tormented or peaceful emotion that Julie feels. One of the best shots in the entire movie is the final one, in which we see Julie, unhappy and tearful, slowly starting to smile. (She also is shown weeping underwater, something I've never seen before) R&eacute;gent seems rather colorless beside Binoche's reverberating performance, but his quiet, sweet Olivier is an underrated character.A harrowing, beautiful and ultimately romantic film, &quot;Blue&quot; brims over with pathos and beautiful direction.

It is filmed even better. It has some cinematography that could be said to rival some of Kubrick's films. Of course, the color blue appears throughout the screen at various times and in several clever ways, but the real gem of the film in keeping in true &quot;Kubrick-esque&quot; style is the score. This movie makes excellent use of music, not just as a &quot;mood-setting device&quot;, but also as a narration and puntuation trigger, not altogether unlike things that we associate with Godard's films. I applaud this director's keen sense of how music can empower a scene and give it great depth and subtle meaning.Film historian and author Annette Insdorf gives a valuable and insightful commentary track that will enhance your understanding, not just of this particular film, but of the Blue, White, and Red trilogy as well as the man Krzysztof Kieslowski himself, personally and professionally.A wonderful DVD - with a behind the scenes documentary and a few extras as well.

Eiserloh ""emeiserloh""","[3, 3]","The ""beauty"" of Kieslowski's later works has little to do with ""pretty pictures,"" but everything to do with his cinematic imagination, and his ability to tap into and enrich the emotional, spiritual, and aesthetic content of his work.The opening sequence to ""Blue,"" involving the car passing through a tunnel, as we are immersed in the ambient sounds (hearing bits of conversation, viewing the swish of vehicles and splash of lights through the window), followed by the passage into late afternoon light (and the silvery blue balloon being sucked out the side window flapping in the breeze), just before the accident, is as astounding in its beauty as it is penetrating in its content....This film is resplendent with cinematic sequences as unique and profound as its opening, and, throughout,"" Kieslowski's use of sound as a way to access Binoche's interior process is absolutely brilliant. Witness the sequence, when she finally feels able to step out into the world again and move into the city after the accident. She rents an apartment on an upper floor of a large, strange vacuous building, and there, that first night, through her window, witnesses the beating of a man on the street, who escapes and runs into her building, the fear on her face, as she listens to him climb the long metal escape stairway, floor by floor, still followed by his assailants, as he comes closer to her....But it is not only the imagery (Binoche blurry through window, staring vacantly somewhere, as she experiences intimate relations for the first time since the accident), or ambient sound (the sudden clamor and echo of the indoor swimming pool as she comes up for air from under water) that reflects the nature of her psyche, but Preisner's haunting music that simultaneously takes us back to her husband and her tragedy, as much as towards her recovery of self. She is a woman who has lived in the shadow of her husband, while yet participating in the creation of the very music he is famous for, and as the music enters the film, each time, it is her reflecting on and coming to terms with all that it represents to her, including, finally, the bridge to her salvation....This is not a typical Hollywood redemption tale handing us the standard prescription for such a tale of woe, no ""how to reclaim your power as a woman course 101."" This is a tale of truth, and we believe Binoche every time she makes a decision because we are not only privy to her experience, but fully engaged in her process.I could go on and on through every scene like this, but it is better to watch and listen to the film several times by yourself....",5,The Beauty of Blue,1195344000,"11 18, 2007",2007,2620,"['beauty', 'Kieslowski', 'later', 'little', 'do', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'everything', 'do', 'cinematic', 'imagination', 'ability', 'tap', 'enrich', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'aesthetic', 'content', 'work.The', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Blue', 'involving', 'car', 'passing', 'tunnel', 'are', 'immersed', 'ambient', 'hearing', 'bits', 'conversation', 'viewing', 'swish', 'vehicles', 'splash', 'lights', 'window', 'followed', 'passage', 'late', 'afternoon', 'light', 'silvery', 'blue', 'balloon', 'being', 'sucked', 'out', 'side', 'window', 'flapping', 'breeze', 'just', 'accident', 'astounding', 'beauty', 'penetrating', 'content', '.This', 'film', 'resplendent', 'cinematic', 'sequences', 'unique', 'profound', 'opening', 'Kieslowski', 'use', 'sound', 'way', 'access', 'Binoche', 'interior', 'process', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'sequence', 'when', 'finally', 'able', 'step', 'out', 'world', 'again', 'move', 'city', 'accident', 'apartment', 'upper', 'floor', 'large', 'strange', 'vacuous', 'building', 'there', 'first', 'night', 'window', 'beating', 'man', 'street', 'who', 'building', 'fear', 'face', 'climb', 'long', 'metal', 'escape', 'stairway', 'floor', 'floor', 'still', 'followed', 'assailants', 'closer', '.But', 'not', 'only', 'imagery', 'Binoche', 'blurry', 'window', 'staring', 'vacantly', 'somewhere', 'intimate', 'relations', 'first', 'time', 'accident', 'ambient', 'sound', 'sudden', 'clamor', 'echo', 'indoor', 'swimming', 'pool', 'up', 'air', 'water', 'nature', 'psyche', 'Preisner', 'haunting', 'music', 'simultaneously', 'back', 'husband', 'tragedy', 'as', 'much', 'recovery', 'self', 'woman', 'who', 'lived', 'shadow', 'husband', 'yet', 'participating', 'creation', 'very', 'music', 'famous', 'music', 'film', 'time', 'reflecting', 'coming', 'terms', 'including', 'finally', 'bridge', 'salvation', '.This', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'redemption', 'tale', 'handing', 'standard', 'prescription', 'tale', 'woe', 'how', 'reclaim', 'power', 'woman', 'course', '101', 'tale', 'truth', 'believe', 'Binoche', 'time', 'decision', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'privy', 'experience', 'fully', 'engaged', 'process.I', 'could', 'go', 'scene', 'better', 'watch', 'listen', 'film', 'several', 'times']",N/A

It was breathtaking. The film focuses on trying to live with the grief she feels after her husband and daughter die in a car accident. She gets rid of their house and moves to a new apartment trying to move on with her life. She befriends a woman in the apartment building (who happens to be a woman that the rest of the residents want to evict). The film moves somewhat slowly but never too slowly. The course of the film is perfect to convey Binoche's grief and angst and her eventual coming to terms with the realities of her life before and after her family's death. She discovers that her husband was having an affair with another woman... a woman with whom he was in love. A woman whom Binoche comes to meet and discover is pregnant with a child. Binoche finally gives the home she and the husband had shared to this woman so the child can grow up in its father's home. Binoche also experiences a reawakening of love... and finishes the last work her composer husband left behind. A beautiful film with some of the most superior acting.

On the surface and most literal level, these films were designed to explore the French revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity as they  apply to contemporary life.  BLUE is a meditation on liberty, but a liberty  achieved through loss and isolation.  The movie is a thoughtful and  compassionate look at the events and emotions that shape the choices each  person makes in his or her life.Julie attempts to flee from her past after  surviving an accident that kills her immediate family.  She then severes  all ties to the past and leaves for Paris.  (This is not Paris of the  Nouvelle Vague or the touristic city reproduced in postcards, television,  and the movies.  It's as if the film-maker is trying to say that this story  can happen in any bustling metropolis.)  Despite her new-found anonymity in  the big city, she soon learns that the past intrudes, persistently, and  finds herself coming out of her isolation. Kieslowski doesn't quite tell us  what is going on in the mind and heart of Julie.  Instead, he indicates her  confused yet radiant soul--no small feat in these 'post-modern' times of  lost interiority.  This is what Kieslowski is after, this sense of a  vibrant imagination.  Quite appropriate to our post-ideological climate,  the film suggests that liberty is a phantom, imperfect and unrealistic at  best.  Despite how her second life turns out, Julie's long day closes with  a note of fraternity:  no man is an island, every man has a soul.",5,&quot;THE ART OF LOSING ISN'T HARD TO MASTER...&quot;,925084800,"04 26, 1999",1999,1548,"['BLUE', 'first', 'film', 'Kieslowski', 'THREE', 'COLORS', 'TRILOGY', 'surface', 'most', 'literal', 'level', 'films', 'were', 'designed', 'explore', 'French', 'revolutionary', 'ideals', 'liberty', 'equality', 'fraternity', 'apply', 'contemporary', 'life', 'BLUE', 'meditation', 'liberty', 'liberty', 'achieved', 'loss', 'isolation', 'movie', 'thoughtful', 'compassionate', 'look', 'events', 'emotions', 'shape', 'choices', 'person', 'life.Julie', 'attempts', 'flee', 'past', 'surviving', 'accident', 'immediate', 'family', 'then', 'ties', 'past', 'Paris', 'not', 'Paris', 'Nouvelle', 'Vague', 'touristic', 'city', 'reproduced', 'postcards', 'television', 'movies', 'film-maker', 'trying', 'say', 'story', 'can', 'happen', 'bustling', 'metropolis', 'new-found', 'anonymity', 'big', 'city', 'soon', 'past', 'intrudes', 'persistently', 'coming', 'isolation', 'Kieslowski', ""n't"", 'quite', 'tell', 'going', 'mind', 'heart', 'Julie', 'Instead', 'confused', 'yet', 'radiant', 'soul', 'small', 'feat', ""'post-modern"", 'times', 'lost', 'interiority', 'what', 'Kieslowski', 'sense', 'vibrant', 'imagination', 'Quite', 'appropriate', 'post-ideological', 'climate', 'film', 'liberty', 'phantom', 'imperfect', 'unrealistic', 'best', 'how', 'second', 'life', 'out', 'Julie', 'long', 'day', 'note', 'fraternity', 'man', 'island', 'man', 'soul']",N/A

I suspect that the naming of the set is in some way related to the French tricolor flag rather than Old Glory.The plot seems simple enough. Juliette Binoche plays Julie, the sole survivor of an auto accident that kills her famous, composer husband and her young daughter. After release from the hospital, she discards or sells everything from her previous life. With only a box containing a ceiling lamp comprised of cut pieces of BLUE glass on a multitude of hanging threads, she moves to the big city, presumably Paris, where, with the help of an apparently large personal bank account (because she doesn't work), she sets up house and begins the process of re-connecting to her emotional self.The film director's vision is apparently that the viewer infer what is going on inside Julie by observing her face in close-up. (And what an exquisite face Binoche has - I could lose myself in her eyes!) Whether Julie is interacting with the her husband's composer friend who loves her, or the boy who found a necklace at the scene of the accident, or the promiscuous young woman who lives downstairs, or the family of mice in her closet, or the lawyer charged with selling her old home, her facial expressions are really all we have to deduce the turmoil of her inner space. Even when Julie discovers a surprising secret about her husband's life, her overt actions and speech are remarkably non-expressive of what she must truly be feeling. Somehow, what I perceived in Julie's countenance wasn't always enough, and I arrived at the ending credits vaguely dissatisfied.I concede that BLUE is a classy production, but it must be too subtle for my proletarian tastes.

I was immediately hooked by this powerful work or art and have since purchased a copy. Juliette Binoche is brilliant as a woman who loses her husband and child in a senseless accident. Beyond the normal horror of such loss, is the problem of the haunting, unfinished music that her husband was expected to complete for a celebration of the unity of Europe. Binoche's character, it gradually becomes clear, was its real composer, but she wants nothing to do with it, even going so far as to attempt to destroy the unfinished sheet music.  The issue of the freedom of the individual runs through this film. The prostitute neighbor becomes a friend because Binoche refuses to sign a petition to have her thrown out of her apartment for plying her trade. The woman at the transcription service could have simply carried out her duties, but instead preserves a copy of the music because she feels it is too beautiful to be lost.

Julie (Juliette Binoche) is the sole survivor in a car accident where she loses her husband and daughter.  She falls into a depression where she begins to rid herself of everything that reminds her of her departed husband.  In the process of freeing herself from her husband who was a prominent composer, she cuts off all ties from her past by moving to an undisclosed location in Paris.  She attempts to withdraw from people and live in seclusion, however, several situations force her to keep contact with people from her present and past existence.  The past that she makes an effort to avoid seems to draw her back to the social milieu and it seems like the past also helps to heal her spiritual wounds.  Blue is a powerful film that grabs the audience and forces the viewer through a private cerebral catharsis.  In addition, there are several elements and sub plots that encourage self-reflection and individual growth.

361224,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,6303160344,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[7, 7]","Juliette Binoche gives a startling performance here as a young woman whose husband and young daughter are both killed in a car crash that puts her in the hospital with not much more than some bruising.  What's so powerful about this film is not what is said--or what is not said, but conveyed by the tremendous collaboration of actor and director--through gesture, through facial expression, through visual technique, through sound.  One of Kieslowski's last films, this is light years away from earlier work like, for example, Blind Chance, and fearlessly probes the inner life of a grief-stricken woman.As Binoche herself points out in an interview--one of the many great special features on this disk--the scene in which she crunches a lollipop (the sound is magnified with a contact mike to convey the smashing of the hard candy with her teeth) is far more effective than would be her screaming or sobbing.  Kieslowski uses an interesting mix of visual and aural techniques to express the woman's guilt, grief, and, more than anything else, loss of desire to connect to others.Earlier in the film, soon after the accident, she does forge a physical connection with her deceased husband's colleague, but it is a one-night stand that she needs to give back to her a sense of her body, nothing more.  She quickly dismisses him the next day.The theme of this film, it seems to me, is not whether a person can be altruistic or not, as stated by film critic Annette Insdorf in another special feature, but whether a person can actually make a connection to another person.  Binoche's Julie (her character's name) rids herself of everything connected to her marriage after the accident, but because people, in oen way or another, impose themselves on her, she has no choice but to, ultimately reforge connections with those around her.The title is reflected in the blue that permeates the film--in the water in which she swims, in a blue glass chandelier, in the lighting of many frames for which the cinematographer, also interviewed, indicates he used a subtle blue gel filter.  Blue also conveys pornography, and even that is here, in the form of a neighbor of Julie's who works in the sex industry.  And, of course, it refers to sadness.But as well, blue is the color of the French flag correlated with liberty.  Here, Kieslowski tells the tale of a woman liberated from her former life by tragic circumstances.  It is this liberation, he says, (the implication is that it may be through tragic or non-tragic circumstances) that allows us to forge connections with others, connections that we might not otherwise make without being liberated.A beautifully shot film, Blue is a unique marvel of cinema that should without question establish Kieslowski as one of the master filmmakers of the 20th century.

361226,A2QNTHH66G4Q4F,6303160344,Marni Frankel,"[5, 5]","I can think of very few actresses that could pull off Juliette Binoche's feat. I watched this part of the trilogy last: Red first, then White, then Blue. I think that some reviewers of this movie impose a quite narrow definition of liberty, one that might -- or might not -- dovetail with Kieslowski's own.We know very little about Julie Vignon's relationship with her husband and child prior to their tragedy. I believe that this is an intentional and critical aspect of this film.  In the face of horrible circumstance Julie Vignon does the one thing that she knows she can do: depend on her strength, resources, and clarity of thought. I do not think it's necessarily the case that her suicidal impulse post-tragedy was driven entirely by her loss: bereft, certainly. But she clearly had a complicated marital situation, coupled with a whole other life - both inner and extra-marital, plus a mess of a rabid public to face: in short, I think it would be the force of all of these circumstances that would drive her to a knee-jerk action that she ultimately did not take.This ""liberty"" is not just Vignon's understanding of liberty, but, rather, a contemplation on the meaning of liberty at both the personal and national levels (what does liberty mean to a unified or ""United Europe""? to a married person? a widowed person? a street musician? a prostitute? an addled mother?). Vignon is not cold; in fact, quite the opposite: she is pragmatic and rational - and not even hyper-rational at that. She is wholly good and she is generous (a wonderful line uttered by Sandrine in the latter part of the movie). And that reflects the flip side of the color blue and perhaps the double-meaning that runs throughout this movie.  Yes, blue - the color of cold, of lack of feeling. But what about blue, the color of peace and tranquility? Of loyalty? Of productiveness? Of sparkle? And of strength?I watched this movie alone: for me it required concentration, a certain state of mind. I know of some people who thought it would have played better and faster in slow mo rewind, but if you liked the Color of Paradise and Eternity and a Day, other movies that unfolded at their own pace but didn't skimp on beauty, you might like Kieslowski's Blue.

She flees her old life, setting herself up anonymously in Paris, but pieces of her old life-- including some she didn't know existed-- keep cropping up to stall her flight at every turn.If you've never seen a Kieslowski film, it's very difficult to explain what it is that makes him, as some have said, the best European filmmaker of the twentieth century; it has to do with the attention to detail, the subtleties of his movies, as opposed to the larger constructions of plot, setting, or theme. Granted, he uses all these things masterfully. It would be difficult to focus on a filmmaker's wonderful attention to detail if the movie holding those details up is a travesty (cf. every film M. Night Shyamalan has made since Unbreakable). But whereas some filmmakers are capable of producing wonderful set pieces that one can watch over and over again without remembering much of anything about them-- think, for example, about the cult hit Tremors-- scenes from Kieslowski flicks will haunt you for years after you first see them. A close-up of a face, say. An awkward telephone conversation. Juliette Binoche running her hand along a wall, so lost in thought that she doesn't realize she's drawing blood. (Yes, that's really Juliette Binoche's hand, and her blood.) It's these little things that separate the Kieslowskis of the world from the guys who are almost, but not quite, that good.

""Blue"" is set in France, ""White"" in Poland and ""Red"" in Switzerland, but all production was based in France... Not only are the colors of the trilogy those of the French national flag; the original intention was meditation on the ideals of the French Revolution: freedom, equality and fraternity... This suggests a political dimension to the work... But though like most Polish filmmakers Kieslowski had his difficulties with the Polish Communist system, its collapse by the early 1990s meant that he was not only free to work where he pleased, but liberated from the necessity for his films to engage directly in the political process...In ""Three Colors Blue"" Juliette Binoche plays a woman whose husband and daughter are killed in a car crash... Overcome by melancholy, she progressively withdraws from life, depriving herself of possessions and refusing relationships, a state of mind conveyed in part by the director's subtle use of color blue... But eventually she is able to accept the attentions of a lover and even to offer friendship to another woman who is pregnant with her husband's child... Finally, she completes the piece of music which her husband has been commissioned to write...The result is a work that has less in common with the Polish 'Cinema of moral concern' of the late 1970s than with the tradition of the mainstream European art cinema, in its concerns with alienation and the loss of feeling, countered by the transcendent power of love...",3,The film represents the apotheosis of European art cinema just at the moment when its very existence seemed most uncertain...,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,1572,"['Three', 'Colors', 'Blue', 'first', 'part', 'Polish', 'director', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'Three', 'Colors', 'trilogy', 'Blue', 'set', 'France', 'White', 'Poland', 'Red', 'Switzerland', 'production', 'was', 'based', 'France', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'colors', 'trilogy', 'French', 'national', 'flag', 'original', 'intention', 'was', 'meditation', 'ideals', 'French', 'Revolution', 'freedom', 'equality', 'fraternity', 'political', 'dimension', 'work', 'most', 'Polish', 'filmmakers', 'Kieslowski', 'had', 'difficulties', 'Polish', 'Communist', 'system', 'collapse', 'early', '1990s', 'meant', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'free', 'work', 'where', 'pleased', 'liberated', 'necessity', 'films', 'engage', 'directly', 'political', 'process', 'Three', 'Colors', 'Blue', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'woman', 'husband', 'daughter', 'are', 'killed', 'car', 'crash', 'Overcome', 'melancholy', 'progressively', 'withdraws', 'life', 'depriving', 'possessions', 'refusing', 'relationships', 'state', 'mind', 'conveyed', 'part', 'director', 'subtle', 'use', 'color', 'blue', 'eventually', 'able', 'accept', 'attentions', 'lover', 'even', 'offer', 'friendship', 'woman', 'who', 'pregnant', 'husband', 'child', 'Finally', 'piece', 'music', 'husband', 'been', 'commissioned', 'write', 'result', 'work', 'less', 'common', 'Polish', ""'Cinema"", 'moral', 'concern', 'late', '1970s', 'tradition', 'mainstream', 'European', 'art', 'cinema', 'concerns', 'alienation', 'loss', 'feeling', 'countered', 'transcendent', 'power', 'love']",N/A

Really, all three films are outstanding and I couldn't recommend them more highly.However, as an animal lover, I was bothered by Julie's 'solution' to the problem of finding a mother mouse and her tiny babies, in her closet.  I agree that few people want to find a mouse family in their house, but to dispatch the neighbor's cat to kill them all was cruel and unnecessary.  She could have left the mice until they were old enough to trap and release, she could have moved the family in a suitable 'house' outside, or she could have put them in a cage and allowed the family to grow until they could be safely released.We treat other creatures in a too cavalier manner.  These animals are living creatures and deserve to live their lives out without human interference in such a sense as Julie did.  This bothered me thoughout the film.At least in 'Red' Kieaelowski allowed that the German Shepherd dog, who was 'run over' by the female protagonist Valentine, survived and was treated with love and respect by her owner.  At one point, it showed that the puppies survived and were doing well.Other than that, I loved Blue and plan on buying all three films on DVD.  Blue was very well acted and the music was just fantastic.  The soundtrack to Blue is available here and I plan on buying that as well.  The music is used very effectively.  It intrudes in a way that I felt the Julie character (who was married to a composer and helped edit his work) was just struck by the powerful nature of the music, perhaps as she had envisioned it or as she shared her husbands obsession with it.Highly recommended.

Maybe you think,  &quot;Hey, Camus handled that sort of thing well in the Stranger.&quot;  Well it isn't here.  If you think it is, then perhaps you enjoy watching  strokes unfold, but I don't.I'm all for minimalism, but this plotless  wonder takes it a bit too far.  I think that color can be an effective way  to tell a story, Eyes Wide Shut proved that, but staring at blue pools,  jewels, and backgrounds for one and half hours won't get the job done.  Color can be an element of a movie, but it's just the beginning--you still  need something like dramatic tension, a climax, and denouement.  This one  lacks any semblance of all three.  And having cool colors and a good  soundtrack doesn't make up for the complete absense of a compelling story.  (Her husband's dead; she does nothing; why do I care?)

361241,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,6303160344,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","""Blue"" is at bottom a very sentimental movie, but for American audiences, that sentimentality is perhaps masked by its narrative and cinematic strategies which are very unlike their typical Americam counterparts. Plot, for example, is pretty non-existent in this movie, with its big revelation coming almost accidentally; pacing is relaxed, with the camera lingering on its images for longer than we are perhaps used to; the framing of the images is clearly very considered, and they are a pleasure to look at, even when they seem neutral in relation to the story or the feelings of the central character; and there isn't much dialogue -- basically, the pictures tell the story, as if Kieslowski sees his medium first and foremost as a visual one and trusts it to communicate what's necessary.A lot depends on Juliette Binoche. She is an actress made for movies, because her face -- and we see a lot of it here -- is unusually expressive. Context helps, of course, but we can almost read what's going on in her mind just by watching her -- in this respect, she is unlike, say, Catherine Deneuve, whose beauty and watchability are very different. Given Binoche's emotional transparency, the need for talk is much reduced. Here she plays Julie de Courcy, a woman devastated by the death of her husband and her child in a car wreck (she too was in the car but survives with apparently relatively minor injuries). The movie traces her movement from her belief that her life isn't worth living to a reattachment to life and to music. The latter is important because it appears that her late husband, a famous composer working on a cantata to celebrate the European Union (EU), perhaps was NOT the composer in the family but that Julie herself was. (The matter is a bit ambiguous -- perhaps they were co-composers -- but Julie's compositional talent is not in question.) Some of the most striking images in the movie are at moments when Julie seems overcome by an auditory hallucination of music -- music in her head -- and it's a token of what is in there to be openly articulated and a token too that Julie's life has not stopped with the death of her husband and child, even though at first she can see no clear way forward and tries to retreat into anonymity. But . . . the life force and the music-force will not be gainsaid, and as the movie goes on, we begin to understand that Julie is temperamentally incapable of being unproductive and disconnected. It's not a question of her having to be argued out of mourning or depression -- she just has to acknowledge that these feelings do not define or limit her. We see her acting with great but unforced generosity to a number of people -- the young man who sees the car wreck, the composer friend of her husband, who has long loved her from afar, the young sex-worker who lives on the floor below and whom the other residents want to force out, and quite amazingly, the pregnant mistress of her husband, whose existence she didn't know about. It would be wrong to say of Julie that she is ""understanding,"" for she doesn't rationalize her generous behavior -- it's just how she is, and when she accepts herself as making these connections (and remains connected to her demented mother, played elegantly in a cameo by Emmanuelle Riva) she is able in turn to produce music and not just hear it in her head.The music that Julie and/or her husband are composing was written for the movie by the Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner. The finale to the EU cantata, that we see Julie compose, is a setting of the Greek text from 1 Corinthians 13. It has power as music and it tangentially connects Julie's reawakening to relationship to political circumstances (the ""relationships"" that constitute the EU), but Kieslowski doesn't play that up too much. The problems that we look to politics to solve hover on the edge of the picture in the predicament of Julie's mother, the glimpse we see of difficulties of aging, and in a violent beating that Julie sees in the street outside her apartment. Kieslowski shows us love in action, but these glimpses show us that love has a lot of work to do -- or perhaps make us think that more than love, or art, or wealth (for Julie is wealthy) is going to be needed in the wider world.

If the actress chosen for the lead role was a marginal one, then the film probably would not be worth talking about.  Thankfully, Juliette Binoche proves to be more than up to the task and skillfully overcomes all the demands placed upon her by this difficult role.  The end result is a memorable film showcasing an even more memorable performance.""Blue"" is a film about tragedy and courage.  It begins with a car trip with Julie (Binoche), her husband, and her young daughter.  Everything appears normal but cruel fate intervenes and the car crashes into a tree.  When Julie wakes up in the hospital, she is told that her husband and daughter did not survive.  She is devastated by the news and loses the will to live.  However, Julie collects herself and decides to try getting on with her life.  Yet she constantly puts herself through periodic tests to make sure she is still capable of feeling emotion.  After a series of incidents that includes an intimate night with a colleague, a problem with mice in the closet, and her coming to the aid of a neighbor, Julie concludes she still possesses the strength to continue in this world.  An encounter with her husband's former mistress provides her with even more resolve to stay alive when their meeting in a courthouse produces one more revelation.Binoche is mesmerizing in this film as her performance deftly communicates every thought she is thinking and every feeling she is experiencing.  This is a mature film that deals with complex subjects in an honest manner.  ""Blue"" is not a fairy tale that glosses over the more difficult and unfair aspects of everyday life.  It is a film that celebrates courage but reminds us that the triumph of the human spirit usually only comes after great suffering.  Krzysztof Kieslowski blends colors, sounds, and images seamlessly to convey this idea and perfectly guides Binoche through what must have been an emotionally-draining endeavor.  In short, ""Blue"" is the perfect film for all film watchers tired of Hollywood excess.",3,&quot;I had an accident and lost my husband and child.&quot;,1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,2077,"['Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'Blue', 'one', 'woman', 'showcase', 'actress', 'chosen', 'lead', 'role', 'was', 'marginal', 'one', 'then', 'film', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'worth', 'talking', 'Thankfully', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'be', 'more', 'up', 'task', 'skillfully', 'demands', 'placed', 'difficult', 'role', 'end', 'result', 'memorable', 'film', 'showcasing', 'even', 'more', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Blue', 'film', 'tragedy', 'courage', 'car', 'trip', 'Julie', 'Binoche', 'husband', 'young', 'daughter', 'Everything', 'normal', 'cruel', 'fate', 'intervenes', 'car', 'crashes', 'tree', 'When', 'Julie', 'up', 'hospital', 'told', 'husband', 'daughter', 'did', 'not', 'survive', 'devastated', 'news', 'will', 'live', 'However', 'Julie', 'decides', 'try', 'getting', 'life', 'constantly', 'periodic', 'tests', 'make', 'sure', 'still', 'capable', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'series', 'incidents', 'intimate', 'night', 'colleague', 'problem', 'mice', 'closet', 'coming', 'aid', 'neighbor', 'Julie', 'still', 'strength', 'continue', 'world', 'encounter', 'husband', 'former', 'mistress', 'even', 'more', 'resolve', 'stay', 'alive', 'when', 'meeting', 'courthouse', 'one', 'more', 'revelation.Binoche', 'mesmerizing', 'film', 'performance', 'deftly', 'thought', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'experiencing', 'mature', 'film', 'deals', 'complex', 'subjects', 'honest', 'manner', 'Blue', 'not', 'fairy', 'tale', 'more', 'difficult', 'unfair', 'aspects', 'everyday', 'life', 'film', 'courage', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'usually', 'only', 'great', 'suffering', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'colors', 'sounds', 'seamlessly', 'convey', 'idea', 'perfectly', 'guides', 'Binoche', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'emotionally-draining', 'endeavor', 'short', 'Blue', 'perfect', 'film', 'film', 'watchers', 'tired', 'Hollywood', 'excess']",N/A

A decision to have a cat kill a mother mouse and her babies rekindles a maternal feeling.

She learns from the same interview that her dead husband had had a mistress.  Jealousy moves her back into the human sphere here.This movie recalls Kundera's &quot;Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; in that it aims to show that a life without emotinal attachments is hollow indeed.Kieslowski's brings into play his fascination with coincidence and how it links people and changes fate.

However, Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski is obviously a master at his craft and in his ""Blue,"" he not only takes a look at grief, but also its internalization and the liberation of death, sides not often studied.  In the opening sequence of the film, Julie Vignon de Courcy (Juliette Binoche) is with her famed composer husband and daughter in a car that crashes into a tree, killing all but Julie.  She must learn to achieve catharsis post-accident, and Kieslowski observes her means of closure, utilizing various motifs (ie the blue pool) to emphasize how she superficially disregards pain yet wallows in it every day, whether she admits it or not.  In an amazing scene, Julie finds a blue sucker that seems to remind her of either her husband or daughter, and she cannot scream, so she bites onto the sucker and chomps it, a sound that becomes more visceral than a scream, as it occurs within, her eyes focused on crunching and biting and nashing.  Kieslowski effectively makes these subtle moments as profound as possible, presenting how liberty and closure can be achieved despite pain and further detailing the healing process along the way.  Binoche contributes well with one of the greatest performances in cinematic history.  She depicts Julie with nuance and strength, obviously willing to do whatever it took to make her character believably shaken yet willing to move on.  Near the end of the film, when Julie meets her husband's mistress, she speaks with her and eventually gives her the house in which she formerly lived.  Her husband's mistress says that she expected such generosity, that the husband spoke of Julie in such a positive way that her kindess is not surprising.  By the end of the film, we are not surprised either.
