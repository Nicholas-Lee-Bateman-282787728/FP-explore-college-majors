It will confirm your prejudicial biases that the rest of the country is full of red-neck Christian right kooks.  This movie is so awful, I couldn't believe it.  It is not remotely believable.  While there are people out there who have extreme views anywhere you live, this movie does not pull it off in any way shape or form.  The acting is terrible, the script it terrible.  Having experiences and relatives that live in such towns as the one portrayed, it doesn't even come close with portraying the depth and mostly goodness of Middle America.  Its not a believable movie in any way the main character is faced with conflict; whether it be working in menial labor, facing the average blue collar worker (who were portrayed in the worse way possible), facing his own homosexual tendencies, facing general homosexuality in general, facing the problems of undocumented un-bilingual Hispanic workers, conflict with his mother, and especially facing anything that remotely looked at spirituality, which I think was supposed to be a main theme of the movie.  There are many ways and paths that people can find spiritual peace.  The arrogance to satirize a person finding spiritual peace with the Christian Right was appalling. After watching this movie, I'd rather live with middle America, than with elitists on the east coast.  The only way this movie could have been good is if it played up the satire and turned this movie into a wacky comedy; but it does not.  It toys with satire only a bit to leave the viewer with the belief that it wants the viewer to believe that middle America is full of uneducated, nutty, anger-filled, delusional Christian right nuts.  If you want a good satirical comedy on middle red-neck America, I suggest you rent Dale and Tucker vs Evil.  Now that is a great movie.

That being said, I surely wouldn't want to be in his family.  Could you imagine hanging out on Christmas, and then having something bad happen?  You'd have to figure that you'd be featured in his next book.  And not necessarily in a good way.And from what I've read, this is just a small slice of Mr. Sedaris' life; what you might call his &#34;Oregon years.&#34;  Off to go find himself, pick a few apples, and get away from that family of his for awhile.  Hey, I can't blame him.  Time spent with extended family is time lost, time that you'll never get back.  I think that I'd rather pick apples in the rain myself.But what's interesting here:  he seems to go full circle, perhaps backwards even since he seemingly only becomes more confused about himself -- perhaps even life itself -- while making that trip to Oregon.  Hey, you can't blame him, really.  While they have some of the best wine in the Willamette Valley, Oregon itself seems to be rather backwards.  While they want to think of themselves as modern-day liberals, at the same time, they hold onto some very conservative views as well.And the young Mr. Sedaris runs into a few conservatives here himself, and he tries to fit in.  He really does.  But ultimately, he learns that people might be the exact opposite of how they wish to portray themselves.  Watch a scene in the third act; it reminds me of a similar scene in &#34;The Color of Money&#34; where Paul Newman throws some money at Tom Cruise, telling the youngster that he's given him all that he's got, and that the young pool upstart has to find his own way in life.And while this film surely doesn't give all that it's got, it is very good.  I'll give a recommendation on this film.  Just stay away from family at Christmastime and everything will be all right.",4,An Apple a Day. . .,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,1879,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'David', 'Sedaris', ""'ve"", 'read', 'most', 'books', 'Funny', 'stuff', 'being', 'said', 'surely', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'family', 'Could', 'imagine', 'hanging', 'out', 'Christmas', 'then', 'having', 'something', 'bad', 'happen', ""'d"", 'have', 'figure', ""'d"", 'be', 'featured', 'next', 'book', 'not', 'necessarily', 'good', 'way.And', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'just', 'small', 'slice', 'Mr.', 'Sedaris', 'life', 'what', 'might', 'call', '34', 'Oregon', 'years.', '34', 'Off', 'go', 'find', 'pick', 'few', 'apples', 'get', 'away', 'family', 'awhile', 'Hey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Time', 'spent', 'extended', 'family', 'time', 'lost', 'time', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'back', 'think', ""'d"", 'rather', 'pick', 'apples', 'rain', 'myself.But', 'what', 'interesting', 'here', 'go', 'full', 'circle', 'perhaps', 'backwards', 'even', 'seemingly', 'only', 'more', 'confused', 'perhaps', 'even', 'life', 'making', 'trip', 'Oregon', 'Hey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'really', 'have', 'best', 'wine', 'Willamette', 'Valley', 'Oregon', 'be', 'rather', 'backwards', 'want', 'think', 'modern-day', 'liberals', 'same', 'time', 'hold', 'very', 'conservative', 'views', 'well.And', 'young', 'Mr.', 'Sedaris', 'few', 'conservatives', 'here', 'fit', 'really', 'ultimately', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'exact', 'opposite', 'how', 'wish', 'portray', 'Watch', 'scene', 'third', 'act', 'similar', 'scene', '34', 'Color', 'Money', '34', 'where', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'money', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'telling', 'youngster', 'given', 'got', 'young', 'pool', 'upstart', 'find', 'own', 'way', 'life.And', 'film', 'surely', ""n't"", 'give', 'got', 'very', 'good', ""'ll"", 'give', 'recommendation', 'film', 'Just', 'stay', 'away', 'family', 'Christmastime', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'right']",C.O.G.

The other aspect of this at times controversial film that makes it important is the choice of casting Jonathan Groff, the gay actor who begins the television series `Looking' this spring. The choices make the film even more enjoyable because the emphasis is not on the gay aspect but instead on the trials of coming of age and struggling with all the bulwarks society places in our way.David (meant to be David Sedaris) is a cocky young man who graduates from Yale, yet to escape his dysfunctional family and see the world as it really is, travels to Oregon to work on an apple farm run by Hobbs (Dean Stockwell). Struggling as a non-Hispanic worker he is befriended by a driver named Curly (Corey Stoll) who picks up on David's sexual ambiguity and attempts to seal his fate. David escapes, falls under the wing Jon (Denis O'Hare), a evangelistic Christian who has a history of alcohol addition and anger management all of which he hides under the cloak of being a C.O.G. (Child of God). David joins Jon in making jade clocks in the shape of Oregon to sell at the fair. He `sees the light' and decides to become a C.O.G. and from there the story plays out in very strange ways. Out of his element, he finds his lifestyle and notions being picked apart by everyone who crosses his path. And his final coming out realization is gently subtle.The cast is uniformly excellent, but the major kudos go to Jonathan Groff who demonstrates his fine acting skills and magnetic screen presence. The film is after all just a story about a boy of our times. It resonates well.

People who were only a step-above walk-ons were simple terrific! The scenery and photography were wonderful.Then there was the story... The only thing I can imagine is that the first and final reel of the version I watched were missing. Or once again, artsy-fartsy was the name of the game.  I do know this. If I hear that a move has come out that was written by Kyle Patrick Alvarez, for the rest of my life I will eat ground glass before I would watch anything this man wrote again. I know it was supposedly based on a story by David Sedaris--who I think is a master writer--but I don't believe it. David is wonderful. This script? Well, if I use the words I want to use, Amazon won't post my review. One of those words is four letters, starts with an &#34;S&#34; and ends with a &#34;T.&#34;I am a gay man. WHY is it that people think that to tell a gay story, it has to be a story with no beginning and no end? Does the author think he is being a master because his story has no...well....story?I was SO angry that I WASTED my time with this movie that I wanted to scream!  I am so sorry Johathan Groff!  I wanted to email you and tell you how awesome this movie was--because you were incredible!  And maybe (and I will only say maybe) Kyle Patrick Alvarez is a really really good director. I know something was wonderful about this movie...But when it ended I was stunned. I kept checking to see if maybe there was a mistake. Was I missing a disk? Was there a scratch on my disk and that is why part of the movie wouldn't play?  Finally I saw that, no--this is where Kyle Patrick Alvarez intended the movie to end. With not ONE resolution at all. Nothing between the main character and his family, nothing to explain if he was in fact gay or not, no resolution between Jonathan's character and ANYONE else in the movie at all. Here I am an hour later, still saying, WTF!I am so torn. In some ways I want you to avoid this movie like a bad case of the crabs. On the other hand, everyone who helped make this movie happen--them I want you to watch this film for. Even the lady that Jonathan worked with on an assembly line--she was incredible!  And maybe that was because of the director?  Maybe he should stick with directing and skip writing EVER EVER EVER again?I'm pissed!  When I watch movies about straight characters, the movie has a beginning, a middle, and an end. So often when I watch a gay movie I am left pissed off or totally unsatisfied.

Also As a fan of David Sedaris, I expected more insight and irony. but I was disappointed all the way through this tedious and self indulgent exercise.The protagonist, David aka Samuel aka David drops out from his high powered academic life to explore life outside of his world at Yale. The character is sarcastic and narcissistic and generally unlikeable. He has no clue how to relate to others outside of his intellectual circle. He is rude and condescending to the people he meets and has no problem shooting barbs at others unlike himself. Then, at a critical point in the story, he doesn't have the guts to stand up to his antagonist. When he gets a second chance to stand up to him, he fails even more miserably, as his veneer of arrogance collapses and he is left as a cowardly shriveled shell of a man.As a supposedly smart guy, he doesn't have the basic common sense to secure his cash somewhere other than stuffed down the side of his bed frame in full view of others in a laborers dormitory.He does not see the frailties and vulnerabilities of the people around him. He befriends a troubled but well meaning man mainly to lean on him for help. Because of his lack of insight, David antagonizes and alienates him.The character through his journey does not evolve, but becomes more of the flawed self he already is.",1,Pointless Exercise,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,1443,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'previews', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'intriguing', 'entertaining', 'journey', 'self', 'discovery', 'Also', 'fan', 'David', 'Sedaris', 'expected', 'more', 'insight', 'irony', 'was', 'disappointed', 'way', 'tedious', 'self', 'indulgent', 'exercise.The', 'protagonist', 'David', 'Samuel', 'aka', 'David', 'out', 'high', 'powered', 'academic', 'life', 'explore', 'life', 'world', 'Yale', 'character', 'sarcastic', 'narcissistic', 'generally', 'unlikeable', 'clue', 'how', 'relate', 'others', 'intellectual', 'circle', 'rude', 'condescending', 'people', 'problem', 'shooting', 'barbs', 'others', 'Then', 'critical', 'point', 'story', ""n't"", 'have', 'guts', 'stand', 'up', 'antagonist', 'When', 'second', 'chance', 'stand', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'miserably', 'veneer', 'arrogance', 'collapses', 'left', 'cowardly', 'shriveled', 'shell', 'man.As', 'supposedly', 'smart', 'guy', ""n't"", 'have', 'basic', 'common', 'sense', 'secure', 'cash', 'somewhere', 'other', 'stuffed', 'down', 'side', 'bed', 'frame', 'full', 'view', 'others', 'laborers', 'dormitory.He', 'not', 'see', 'frailties', 'vulnerabilities', 'people', 'troubled', 'well', 'meaning', 'man', 'mainly', 'lean', 'help', 'lack', 'insight', 'David', 'him.The', 'character', 'journey', 'not', 'evolve', 'more', 'flawed', 'self', 'already']",C.O.G.
