What follows is a delightful study in cultural contrasts but, more importantly, a study in the special issues that 1st generation families face from both the perspective of the parents and the children.  In the end, the movie still manages to be warm and light-hearted while still exposing the key issues in satyrical fashion.  A really fun movie to watch over again.

Director Peter Wang did a great job capturing the experiences of Chinese-American family, headed by their father (Peter Wang), a product of Silicone Valley, who, when passed up for a promotion believes that it is because he is Chinese.  After that setback, he quits his job and uproots his family to go visit relatives in China.  Yet, struggle exists everywhere (even if you try to relocate yourself to get perspective).  Good lord knows the family experiences this in droves, due to cultural misunderstandings and language barriers.  Yet, it is also a very important journey (filled with warm and happy moments, too).  I enjoy that this film is so real and believeable.  The actors are great and they truly work well together as an ensemble.  It also provides insight for audience members unaware of the great divide between people that exists when some family relocates to the United States, while others remain in their native country.

When they meet, both families have preconceived notions of how things should be based on their own culture and they encounter different barriers besides the Great Wall.  These barriers are built upon the minute details that are encountered in everyday life along with ideas that people have been taught through their environment.  These differences are blown up by presumptions of how things should be base on learned morals, values, and beliefs.  The Great Wall presents an interesting idea; however, the film feels forced as the characters seem a little to rigid in their environment.  The end result is an average cinematic experience that does not meet up to the expectations of the story.",3,Culture Crash...,1043539200,"01 26, 2003",2003,809,"['American', 'Fang', 'family', 'going', 'Beijing', 'meet', 'Leo', 'sister', 'family', 'who', 'not', 'seen', '30', 'years', 'When', 'meet', 'families', 'have', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'how', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'based', 'own', 'culture', 'encounter', 'different', 'barriers', 'Great', 'Wall', 'barriers', 'are', 'built', 'minute', 'details', 'are', 'encountered', 'everyday', 'life', 'ideas', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'environment', 'differences', 'are', 'blown', 'up', 'presumptions', 'how', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'base', 'learned', 'morals', 'values', 'beliefs', 'Great', 'Wall', 'interesting', 'idea', 'however', 'film', 'feels', 'forced', 'characters', 'seem', 'little', 'rigid', 'environment', 'end', 'result', 'average', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'not', 'meet', 'up', 'expectations', 'story']",N/A

The San Francisco family consists of the father who was born in China but came to the U.S. early in his life, who still retains his basic roots although has become Americanized, his born in the U.S. Chinese-American wife who is much more Americanized and doesn't speak Chinese but still retains the basic culture, and their totally Americanized son. It's interesting to see how each of them reacts to their experience in China, in particular to the sister's family consisting of her, her very traditional husband, and their impressionable daughter.The experience is handled in a warm and believable way - there's nothing hugely dramatic but then there doesn't have to be. It's a movie about cultural differences and everything is handled tastefully. I also enjoyed the many scenes of Beijing - the grander tourist attractions as well as the everyday living that most people never see. It was very interesting. This is a very well done film and I heartily recommend it.",5,"charming, enjoyable character study",1343088000,"07 24, 2012",2012,1198,"['liked', 'movie', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'culture', 'shock', 'encountered', 'Chinese-American', 'family', 'living', 'San', 'Francisco', 'vacation', 'trip', 'Beijing', 'father', 'visit', 'sister', 'family', 'San', 'Francisco', 'family', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'China', 'came', 'U.S.', 'early', 'life', 'who', 'still', 'basic', 'roots', 'become', 'Americanized', 'born', 'U.S.', 'Chinese-American', 'wife', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'Americanized', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Chinese', 'still', 'basic', 'culture', 'totally', 'Americanized', 'son', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'reacts', 'experience', 'China', 'particular', 'sister', 'family', 'consisting', 'her', 'very', 'traditional', 'husband', 'impressionable', 'daughter.The', 'experience', 'handled', 'warm', 'believable', 'way', 'nothing', 'hugely', 'dramatic', 'then', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'movie', 'cultural', 'differences', 'everything', 'handled', 'tastefully', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'scenes', 'Beijing', 'grander', 'tourist', 'attractions', 'as', 'well', 'everyday', 'living', 'most', 'people', 'never', 'see', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'heartily', 'recommend']",N/A
716541,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B00006I04I,S. Der,"[1, 1]","This is a true good movie that shows the differences between Chinese and Chinese-Americans.What I liked about the movie was it portray the language barrier right off the bat. This might be a shock to people, but many Chinese-American do not speak Mandarin. That's right, they don't speak it because they learn English growing up and not Mandarin. I said Mandarin because saying Chinese isn't exactly correct as there are a bunch of Chinese Langauges out there. So, in the movie what they are speaking is Mandarin.Many people in Beijing don't speak English as well. They do try to learn English, but that still doesn't mean they fully understand everything. That was shown in this movie. I must say though, the Chinese people in China do give more of a enough in learning English than the Chinese-American trying to learn Mandarin. That was shown in the movie when the mother and son both took Chinese Classes, but they didn't know anything whatever someone would talk to them in Mandarin when they were in Beijing. Now, the reverse isn't true as you see Lilli being talked to in English over and over again. She did understand more English than the guy, Paul, understood any Mandarin.As expected, the two different cultures clashes come out and is shown in the movie. I loved seeing and learning about how different the two cultures really are. One thing for sure came out and Chinese-American are very well feed compared to Chinese people in Beijing.Towards the end of the movie, it was very well done as both cultures/families learned a little something about each other and are better off that way.This a great movie to buy and a great movie to watch.
