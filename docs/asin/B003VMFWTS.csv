That being said, ""It's a Meaningful Life"" was cute, but it just didn't have the same spark and Biblical connection that we enjoy from other Veggie Tales DVDs.  The last few have strayed away from the Bible stories and--while they still teach important lessons--we miss that.  I guess it appeals to those who wouldn't consider a Bible-based show, so it has its merits.  Larry and Petunia seem to be the main characters in so many of them lately, but maybe I'm reading too much into it?  The Silly Songs are as clever as they've always been, just amazing.  I actually like the newer songs more than the old school ones as they've been hilariously referencing pop culture.  I think this is worth adding to your collection if you're a VT fan, but our kids never ask for this one; ""Little Joe"" is our favorite and worth adding to your collection.

1367332,A2TFWLHE25JD06,B003VMFWTS,Surrounded,"[5, 39]","When my son was little, we started watching Veggie Tales soon after they came out.  We liked the stories; they were tasteful and funny, and didn't push the religious angle excessively.  ""It's a Meaningful Life"" was the first I had seen since the late 90s.The first thing I noticed was the Bible verses right at the beginning.  So the makers have abandoned any interest they might have had in appealing to non-Christians.  That's OK, I guess; they have a market niche, and don't see the point in risking anything.  But it was disappointing.Another change was the animation.  I remember watching a commentary where the makers revealed that they had chosen vegetables for the characters because they were easier to animate.  At the time, computer animation was in its infancy, and Veggie Tales was cutting-edge.  Now, the technology is so cheap that you can produce cartoons like this on a home computer.  It's no trouble at all to add an ""arm"" codec, where the characters now manipulate objects with invisible limbs, where before, this was kept to a bare minimum.  What's disturbing is that now everyone is wearing clothes, so they don't look like vegetables anymore - they look like Thalidomide victims.  Maybe the change over the years was so gradual as to be unnoticeable to those who watched every movie, but suddenly seeing everyone like that was disconcerting.  What's wrong with keeping the characters as plain, simple vegetables?  Why did they have to spruce it up?The main problem, however, is that the cartoon was unwatchable.  I was expecting an amusing parody of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" a great classic that nevertheless begs to be parodied.  But the story was so changed as to be unrecognizable, and was so simplistic and cliched that I had to turn it off after the first 5 minutes.  So Veggie Tales, once imaginative and engaging, has descended into formulaic tripe.  Maybe this was inevitable; most mainstream cartoon series end up regurgitating the same jokes over and over until someone puts them out of their misery.But it's still disappointing every time it happens.",1,What happened?,1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,2084,"['When', 'son', 'was', 'little', 'started', 'watching', 'Veggie', 'Tales', 'soon', 'came', 'out', 'liked', 'stories', 'were', 'tasteful', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'push', 'religious', 'angle', 'excessively', 'Meaningful', 'Life', 'was', 'first', 'had', 'seen', 'late', '90s.The', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'Bible', 'verses', 'right', 'beginning', 'makers', 'have', 'abandoned', 'interest', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'appealing', 'non-Christians', 'OK', 'guess', 'have', 'market', 'niche', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'point', 'risking', 'anything', 'was', 'disappointing.Another', 'change', 'was', 'animation', 'remember', 'watching', 'commentary', 'where', 'makers', 'revealed', 'had', 'chosen', 'vegetables', 'characters', 'were', 'easier', 'animate', 'time', 'computer', 'animation', 'was', 'infancy', 'Veggie', 'Tales', 'was', 'cutting-edge', 'Now', 'technology', 'so', 'cheap', 'can', 'produce', 'cartoons', 'home', 'computer', 'trouble', 'add', 'arm', 'codec', 'where', 'characters', 'now', 'manipulate', 'objects', 'invisible', 'limbs', 'where', 'before', 'was', 'kept', 'bare', 'minimum', 'What', 'disturbing', 'now', 'everyone', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'vegetables', 'anymore', 'look', 'Thalidomide', 'victims', 'Maybe', 'change', 'years', 'was', 'so', 'gradual', 'be', 'unnoticeable', 'who', 'watched', 'movie', 'suddenly', 'seeing', 'everyone', 'was', 'disconcerting', 'What', 'wrong', 'keeping', 'characters', 'plain', 'simple', 'vegetables', 'Why', 'did', 'have', 'spruce', 'up', 'main', 'problem', 'however', 'cartoon', 'was', 'unwatchable', 'was', 'expecting', 'amusing', 'parody', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'great', 'classic', 'nevertheless', 'begs', 'be', 'parodied', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'changed', 'be', 'unrecognizable', 'was', 'so', 'simplistic', 'cliched', 'had', 'turn', 'off', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'So', 'Veggie', 'Tales', 'once', 'imaginative', 'engaging', 'descended', 'formulaic', 'tripe', 'Maybe', 'was', 'inevitable', 'most', 'mainstream', 'cartoon', 'series', 'end', 'up', 'regurgitating', 'same', 'jokes', 'someone', 'misery.But', 'still', 'disappointing', 'time']",N/A
