I admit to liking the film in general, but have a few notes for fellow enthusiasts.The involvement with WW1 begins in the last half hour.  Vernon is acting in a review for the Royal Flying Corps to solicit Canadian recruits.  He joins up and ends up flying and fighting in France.  We see a five minute segment on a photo recce in an S.E.5,  then landing at the aerodrome, with some Nieuport 28's in the background.  He has to fly the mission again when a bullet hole is discovered that has gone right through all the glass negative plates.On leave finally in Paris to see Irene, they receive news that the American's have joined in.  We again see Vernon in combat firing his cowl guns with the aid of a telescopic sight, which I don't remember seeing shown anywhere else.Later he is transfered to Canada, then on to Fort Worth, as an instructor to cadets.  He has already had one crackup with a student in Canada with a fatality.  While doing a squadron demonstration with another student in the back seat of a JN-4, Vernon stalls as he climbs to avoid an unauthorized take off by another trainer aircraft.

The dancing duo's box office standing had been diminishing so it was logical that RKO broke formula.The film is an exquisitely made biography of the famous husband and wife dancing team, more comparable to the sorts of films Alice Faye was making at 20th Century Fox and even Jeanette Macdonald and Nelson Eddy at MGM. The stars have much more 3 dimensional acting roles than usual which they perform beautifully. The nostalgic tunes, jaunty dance routines and excellent period detail ensure fine entertainment, a first rate production in every way and senstively directed by H C Potter.The print of the film is excellent but there are two awful extras, a cartoon and a musical short. Both are MGM products and suffer the usual problems of this studio's output - overblown and humourless. The musical short is bizarre with 2 second rate forgotten singers playing business rivals in the manufacture of waffle irons! Yep, you better believe it. Since the short is written and directed by the same man, one wonders what he was possible thinking. The cartoon, a cat and mouse opus, lacks the wit of the Warner Brother's equivalent and has an edge of cruelty which is very unattractive - shades of Tom and Jerry.The DVD is OK value but better if purchased as part of one of the Astaire/Rogers sets.",4,Not to Astaire/Rogers formula but very good,1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,1547,"['Story', 'Vernon', 'Irene', 'Castle', 'last', 'least', 'typical', 'incomparable', 'films', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'made', 'together', 'RKO', 'studios', '1930s', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'dismissed', 'not', 'follow', 'usual', 'formula', 'dancing', 'duo', 'box', 'office', 'standing', 'had', 'been', 'diminishing', 'was', 'logical', 'RKO', 'broke', 'formula.The', 'film', 'exquisitely', 'made', 'biography', 'famous', 'husband', 'wife', 'dancing', 'team', 'more', 'comparable', 'sorts', 'films', 'Alice', 'Faye', 'was', 'making', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'even', 'Jeanette', 'Macdonald', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'MGM', 'stars', 'have', 'much', 'more', '3', 'dimensional', 'acting', 'roles', 'usual', 'perform', 'beautifully', 'nostalgic', 'tunes', 'jaunty', 'dance', 'routines', 'excellent', 'period', 'detail', 'ensure', 'fine', 'entertainment', 'first', 'rate', 'production', 'way', 'senstively', 'directed', 'H', 'C', 'Potter.The', 'print', 'film', 'excellent', 'are', 'two', 'awful', 'extras', 'cartoon', 'musical', 'short', 'are', 'MGM', 'products', 'suffer', 'usual', 'problems', 'studio', 'output', 'overblown', 'humourless', 'musical', 'short', 'bizarre', '2', 'second', 'rate', 'forgotten', 'singers', 'playing', 'business', 'rivals', 'manufacture', 'waffle', 'irons', 'Yep', 'better', 'believe', 'short', 'written', 'directed', 'same', 'man', 'one', 'what', 'was', 'possible', 'thinking', 'cartoon', 'cat', 'mouse', 'opus', 'wit', 'Warner', 'Brother', 'equivalent', 'edge', 'cruelty', 'very', 'unattractive', 'shades', 'Tom', 'Jerry.The', 'DVD', 'OK', 'value', 'better', 'purchased', 'part', 'one', 'Astaire/Rogers', 'sets']",N/A

I watched it last--after having watched all their other movies--and I must say, what a finale! I was captivated, mostly by Fred who was as charming as ever, but with the addition of maturity.The emphasis of this movie was on what happened after the wedding, rather than what leads up to it. This in itself is unique for Fred and Ginger. But they pulled it off splendidly. I would have married Fred myself after seeing how tenderly he cared for his wife, to what lengths he would go to make her happy, and how devoted he was to being with her no matter what. The scene where they invent the &quot;Castle Walk&quot; was the most sweet and poignant moment in any of their movies, I think.And Ginger pulled off the progression from an innocent and naive young girl to a passionate, capable woman with the grace of an experienced actress. She trades the smart-mouthed wit of her other movies for the gentleness of a devoted wife. I could hardly tell it was her, so well did she play it, and so completely &quot;other&quot; was this role from the typical Fred and Ginger fare.I can't think of another couple that could be more fit to play the parts of the smashingly famous Castles, even though the story is such a reversal of what I'd come to expect from a Fred and Ginger movie.

It was the only time they starred in a true story. It was also their last film togehter at RKO studios.During the 1910's, Vernon (Fred) and Irene (Ginger) became world famous dancers, introducing several popular dances to Americans for the first time, including the fox trot, polka, and their own ""Castle Walk"".After Vernon and Irene marry, Irene encourages Vernon to give up his flop comedy carrer and focus on his dancing instead. With the help of their friend Maggie (character actress Edna May Oliver in a good performance), they become the toast of Paris before hitting it big in the states.It should be noted that Irene was an American and Vernon British.After their fame in the US, Vernon and Irene became trendsetters, not only with their dancing, but with many products with their name on them. Shortly afterward, WWI begins, and Vernon decides to join the royal air force.Some facts were changed for the movie. The Castles' friend played by Walter Brennan was black in real life. His race was changed in the script because southern exhibiters in 1939 would otherwise have refused to show  the film. The lady that Oliver's character was based on was a lesbian, but that was against the censorship code in place at that time. Despite the changes, the movie is still pretty good.It is nicely acted and is a classy way for Fred and Ginger to go out. They were reunited ten years later at MGM for ""The Berkleys of Broadway"".The DVD includes the first Tom and Jerry cartoon, ""Puss Gets the Boot"", in which Tom was named Jasper. Nice bit of history. On the down side, there is also a terrible musical short.""The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle"" tanked at the box office in 1939, but this DVD is a good way to rediscover it.",4,A classy biography,1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,1834,"['Story', 'Vernon', 'Irene', 'Castle', '1939', 'was', 'change', 'pace', 'film', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'starred', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'last', 'film', 'togehter', 'RKO', 'studios.During', '1910', 'Vernon', 'Fred', 'Irene', 'Ginger', 'became', 'world', 'famous', 'dancers', 'introducing', 'several', 'popular', 'dances', 'Americans', 'first', 'time', 'including', 'fox', 'trot', 'polka', 'own', 'Castle', 'Walk', '.After', 'Vernon', 'Irene', 'marry', 'Irene', 'Vernon', 'give', 'up', 'flop', 'comedy', 'carrer', 'focus', 'dancing', 'instead', 'help', 'friend', 'Maggie', 'character', 'actress', 'Edna', 'May', 'Oliver', 'good', 'performance', 'become', 'toast', 'Paris', 'hitting', 'big', 'states.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Irene', 'was', 'American', 'Vernon', 'British.After', 'fame', 'US', 'Vernon', 'Irene', 'became', 'trendsetters', 'not', 'only', 'dancing', 'many', 'products', 'name', 'Shortly', 'afterward', 'WWI', 'Vernon', 'join', 'royal', 'air', 'force.Some', 'facts', 'were', 'changed', 'movie', 'Castles', 'friend', 'played', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'was', 'black', 'real', 'life', 'race', 'was', 'changed', 'script', 'southern', 'exhibiters', '1939', 'would', 'otherwise', 'have', 'refused', 'show', 'film', 'lady', 'Oliver', 'character', 'was', 'based', 'was', 'lesbian', 'was', 'censorship', 'code', 'place', 'time', 'changes', 'movie', 'still', 'pretty', 'good.It', 'nicely', 'acted', 'classy', 'way', 'Fred', 'Ginger', 'go', 'out', 'were', 'reunited', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'MGM', 'Berkleys', 'Broadway', '.The', 'DVD', 'first', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'cartoon', 'Puss', 'Boot', 'Tom', 'was', 'named', 'Jasper', 'Nice', 'bit', 'history', 'down', 'side', 'also', 'terrible', 'musical', 'short', 'Story', 'Vernon', 'Irene', 'Castle', 'tanked', 'box', 'office', '1939', 'DVD', 'good', 'way', 'rediscover']",N/A

37257,A16QODENBJVUI1,078063019X,Robert Moore,"[3, 7]","THE STORY OF VERNON AND IRENE CASTLE is one of the most disappointing films in the extraordinary musical partnership of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and I frankly am utterly perplexed by the long line of five star reviews it has been getting here.  Have these reviewers seen their other films?  Fred Astaire is one my idols, and I have over the years seen all his musicals for an accumulated total of over 140 times, including TOP HAT nearly 20 times alone.  So, my relatively low regard for this film is not a reflection of my overall regard for Fred and Ginger.The problem with THE STORY OF IRENE AND VERNON CASTLE is that absolutely none of the things that made Astaire and Rogers so great are able to make an appearance.  Instead of the brilliant and innovative dances that invigorate their films, they have to do the famous dances of the Castles.  Instead of great, original songs written especially for the film by some of the legendary songwriters of all time, they do period songs that fall short of the songs of their best films.  Instead of a host of great comic actors and actresses that give the film a hysterical vitality, we get a rather average cast of characters.  And instead of watching with delight Fred and Ginger's comic and musical courtship, we know how this one is going to end (at least those of us who know something of the Castles).  In other words, the almost limitless possibilities that energize the typical Astaire-Rogers film is missing because of the need to tell someone else's story.It isn't that this is so much a bad film as it is a waste of Fred and Ginger's talents.  You could have had far less gifted musical performers do the Castles's numbers.  You could instead have worked up a completely original story for Fred and Ginger.  As it is, their last RKO picture ends up being their least interesting.  They did perform one more time, for MGM in THE BARKLEYS OF BROADWAY, but by then the magic was gone.  That which had made them so unique and special didn't survive the horrors of WW II, and their tenth and final film seemed strangely out of place.I wouldn't discourage anyone who hasn't seen this film not to, but I will say that one could do themselves a far greater favor by rewatching one of their classics, such as THE GAY DIVORCEE, TOP HAT, or SWINGTIME.  Or even FOLLOW THE FLEET, which had a terrible story, but featured some of their very greatest dances, including the extraordinary ""Let's Face the Music and Dance,"" arguably their greatest number together.",3,A mildly disappointing end to their amazing run at RKO,1052524800,"05 10, 2003",2003,2513,"['STORY', 'OF', 'VERNON', 'AND', 'IRENE', 'CASTLE', 'one', 'most', 'disappointing', 'films', 'extraordinary', 'musical', 'partnership', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'frankly', 'am', 'utterly', 'perplexed', 'long', 'line', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'been', 'getting', 'here', 'Have', 'reviewers', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'one', 'idols', 'have', 'years', 'seen', 'musicals', 'accumulated', 'total', '140', 'times', 'including', 'TOP', 'HAT', 'nearly', '20', 'times', 'alone', 'So', 'relatively', 'low', 'regard', 'film', 'not', 'reflection', 'overall', 'regard', 'Fred', 'Ginger.The', 'problem', 'THE', 'STORY', 'OF', 'IRENE', 'AND', 'VERNON', 'CASTLE', 'absolutely', 'none', 'things', 'made', 'Astaire', 'Rogers', 'so', 'great', 'are', 'able', 'make', 'appearance', 'Instead', 'brilliant', 'innovative', 'dances', 'invigorate', 'films', 'have', 'do', 'famous', 'dances', 'Castles', 'Instead', 'great', 'original', 'songs', 'written', 'especially', 'film', 'legendary', 'songwriters', 'time', 'do', 'period', 'songs', 'fall', 'short', 'songs', 'best', 'films', 'Instead', 'host', 'great', 'comic', 'actors', 'actresses', 'give', 'film', 'hysterical', 'vitality', 'get', 'rather', 'average', 'cast', 'characters', 'instead', 'watching', 'delight', 'Fred', 'Ginger', 'comic', 'musical', 'courtship', 'know', 'how', 'one', 'going', 'end', 'least', 'who', 'know', 'something', 'Castles', 'other', 'words', 'almost', 'limitless', 'possibilities', 'energize', 'typical', 'Astaire-Rogers', 'film', 'missing', 'need', 'tell', 'someone', 'else', 'story.It', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'film', 'waste', 'Fred', 'Ginger', 'talents', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'far', 'less', 'gifted', 'musical', 'performers', 'do', 'Castles', 'numbers', 'could', 'instead', 'have', 'worked', 'up', 'completely', 'original', 'story', 'Fred', 'Ginger', 'last', 'RKO', 'picture', 'up', 'being', 'least', 'interesting', 'did', 'perform', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'MGM', 'THE', 'BARKLEYS', 'OF', 'BROADWAY', 'then', 'magic', 'was', 'gone', 'had', 'made', 'so', 'unique', 'special', 'did', ""n't"", 'survive', 'horrors', 'WW', 'II', 'tenth', 'final', 'film', 'seemed', 'strangely', 'place.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'discourage', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'not', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'could', 'do', 'far', 'greater', 'favor', 'rewatching', 'one', 'classics', 'such', 'THE', 'GAY', 'DIVORCEE', 'TOP', 'HAT', 'SWINGTIME', 'even', 'FOLLOW', 'FLEET', 'had', 'terrible', 'story', 'featured', 'very', 'greatest', 'dances', 'including', 'extraordinary', 'Let', 'Face', 'Music', 'Dance', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'number', 'together']",N/A

At the CAFE DE PARIS, some bored diners suddenly roared with delight at the sight of a beautiful young American couple; to a jazz rhythm, they did a dance which had never been seen before.  Effortlessly, they wove about with a step that was intimate without being vulgar, light without being acrobatic.  All Europe - it seemed - was soon flocking to see the international dancing sensations: Mr. &amp; Mrs. Vernon Castle.  The period was also the beginning of a revolution in styles, manners, pleasures and ideas of propriety.  Irene Castle became the symbol of all that was chic in a woman; she bobbed her hair and a million girls bobbed theirs.  She developed a streamlined silhouette, wore riding pants, carried a lap-dog on the street, and a million women imitated her.  The Castles popularised the Castle Walk, the One Step and the Maxixe; millions discovered the pleasures of intimate dancing.  The Castles opened dance halls and millions flocked to see them.  When Vernon Castle died in a plane crash in 1918, he wrote finis to the history of this shining couple who danced like a comet across the carefree days before WWI.  Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers accurately relive their charming story in this well-researched well-acted movie; Astaire and Rogers would make their swan song for the screen a decade later in the fair BARKLEYS OF BROADWAY.",5,A TREAT FROM 1939,1004918400,"11 5, 2001",2001,1429,"['say', 'very', 'beginning', 'jazz', 'craze', 'began', 'April', '1912', 'CAFE', 'DE', 'PARIS', 'bored', 'diners', 'suddenly', 'roared', 'delight', 'sight', 'beautiful', 'young', 'American', 'couple', 'jazz', 'rhythm', 'did', 'dance', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'Effortlessly', 'wove', 'step', 'was', 'intimate', 'being', 'vulgar', 'light', 'being', 'acrobatic', 'Europe', 'seemed', 'was', 'soon', 'flocking', 'see', 'international', 'dancing', 'sensations', 'Mr.', 'amp', 'Mrs.', 'Vernon', 'Castle', 'period', 'was', 'also', 'beginning', 'revolution', 'styles', 'manners', 'pleasures', 'ideas', 'propriety', 'Irene', 'Castle', 'became', 'symbol', 'was', 'chic', 'woman', 'bobbed', 'hair', 'million', 'girls', 'bobbed', 'theirs', 'developed', 'streamlined', 'silhouette', 'wore', 'riding', 'pants', 'carried', 'lap-dog', 'street', 'million', 'women', 'imitated', 'Castles', 'popularised', 'Castle', 'Walk', 'One', 'Step', 'Maxixe', 'millions', 'discovered', 'pleasures', 'intimate', 'dancing', 'Castles', 'opened', 'dance', 'halls', 'millions', 'flocked', 'see', 'When', 'Vernon', 'Castle', 'died', 'plane', 'crash', '1918', 'wrote', 'finis', 'history', 'shining', 'couple', 'who', 'danced', 'comet', 'carefree', 'days', 'WWI', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'accurately', 'relive', 'charming', 'story', 'well-researched', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'Astaire', 'Rogers', 'would', 'make', 'swan', 'song', 'screen', 'decade', 'later', 'fair', 'BARKLEYS', 'OF', 'BROADWAY']",N/A
37259,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,078063019X,Simon Davis,"[2, 3]","This is the ultimate way for a top flight screen team to go out in style. ""The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle"" was the ninth teaming of the legendary dance team of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and was a fitting conclusion to one of the greatest screen collaborations in movie history. While they would reteam at a later date for ""The Barkely's of Broadway"" it is for their RKO films that they are rightly remembered.This excellent film has a very bittersweet feeling to it as we as viewers know that this is the last teaming by the two stars. The film combines drama, period detail and strong doses of sentiment and romance into an unusual vechicle for Fred and Ginger. For the first time in their teaming they portray actual historical figures..the legendary American dance team of Vernon and Irene Castle who in the early part of last century created a world wide sensation with their innovative interpretations of the foxtrot and polka among other numbers. They were also famous for a few of their own creations such as the Castle Walk which created a dance craze like no other the world has witnessed.The story follows their life story together from Fred starting out as a second string vaudeville star to his marriage to Irene, to their lean years hiding from paying the rent in rundown hotels through to their great success in Paris on to  when they become the toast of the dancing world. History is also incorporated into the story whereby World War 1 seperates them at the height of their success and concludes with Fred being killed in a flight accident. Rarely has there ever been anything about real life  included in an Astaire & Rogers production but the two stars rise to the occasion beautifully and it is I feel their most heart felt production. Gone from this production are the mistaken identity plots so often used in their past vechicles together. Here we see what could really be classified as a drama combined with the most beautiful dance sequences you could imagine. In that way ""The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle"" is just as memorable as their earlier great successes together like ""The Gay Divorcee"", ""Top Hat""' and ""Swing Time"".The look of this production is really beautiful with all the great attention to the period detail. Indeed I often think this film has an MGM look about it so meticulous is the attention to appropiate costumne and settings. Ginger Rogers, who by this stage was starting to branch out into solo work with other leading men in a mixture of comedies and dramas is exceptional as Irene and she mentions in her autobiography that she had the real Irene Castle to contend with during this production as a creative adviser  which was a very unnerving experience for her. She need not have worried as she delivers a wonderfully balanced piece of acting here and her character progresses beautifully from naive small town girl into a sophisticated woman of the world and the envy of every woman of her generation. In particular the scenes of her effect on the women of her time are both beautifully and amusingly done with her influence moving into fashion, face cream, hair styles etc . Fred Astaire , it goes without saying is in top form in thi sproduction and his dancing both in solo numbers and combining with Ginger are a real joy to witness and reveal why he is regarded as the greatest dancer movies have ever witnessed.The supporting cast also adds wonderfully to the great feel that this film delivers. The wonderfully talented character actress Edna May Oliver, a supporting performer in countless memorable Hollywood productions, plays Maggie Sutton the gruff business manager with the heart of gold who sees the Castle's progress from poverty to world wide success and ultimately tragedy. Walter Brennan lends very able support as Fred's friend Walter who is a constant presence in their lives and is also, like Maggie, along for a life journey with the Castles.For those of you who love fine dancing performed by the masters ""The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle"" can't be  faulted. This film is unique in that it displays Fred and Ginger team as real life historical characters who gave the joy of dancing to a whole new generation. It's a beautiful production and is a wonderful showcase for the shining talents that were Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.",5,Fitting swan song for Fred and Ginger at RKO,1024272000,"06 17, 2002",2002,4322,"['ultimate', 'way', 'top', 'flight', 'screen', 'team', 'go', 'out', 'style', 'Story', 'Vernon', 'Irene', 'Castle', 'was', 'ninth', 'teaming', 'legendary', 'dance', 'team', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'was', 'fitting', 'conclusion', 'one', 'greatest', 'screen', 'collaborations', 'movie', 'history', 'would', 'reteam', 'later', 'date', 'Barkely', 'Broadway', 'RKO', 'films', 'are', 'rightly', 'remembered.This', 'excellent', 'film', 'very', 'bittersweet', 'feeling', 'viewers', 'know', 'last', 'teaming', 'two', 'stars', 'film', 'combines', 'drama', 'period', 'detail', 'strong', 'doses', 'sentiment', 'romance', 'unusual', 'vechicle', 'Fred', 'Ginger', 'first', 'time', 'teaming', 'portray', 'actual', 'historical', 'figures..the', 'legendary', 'American', 'dance', 'team', 'Vernon', 'Irene', 'Castle', 'who', 'early', 'part', 'last', 'century', 'created', 'world', 'wide', 'sensation', 'innovative', 'interpretations', 'foxtrot', 'polka', 'other', 'numbers', 'were', 'also', 'famous', 'few', 'own', 'creations', 'such', 'Castle', 'Walk', 'created', 'dance', 'craze', 'other', 'world', 'witnessed.The', 'story', 'life', 'story', 'together', 'Fred', 'starting', 'out', 'second', 'string', 'vaudeville', 'star', 'marriage', 'Irene', 'lean', 'years', 'hiding', 'paying', 'rent', 'rundown', 'hotels', 'great', 'success', 'Paris', 'when', 'become', 'toast', 'dancing', 'world', 'History', 'also', 'incorporated', 'story', 'whereby', 'World', 'War', '1', 'height', 'success', 'concludes', 'Fred', 'being', 'killed', 'flight', 'accident', 'Rarely', 'ever', 'been', 'anything', 'real', 'life', 'included', 'Astaire', 'Rogers', 'production', 'two', 'stars', 'rise', 'occasion', 'beautifully', 'feel', 'most', 'heart', 'felt', 'production', 'Gone', 'production', 'are', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'plots', 'so', 'often', 'used', 'past', 'vechicles', 'together', 'Here', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'classified', 'drama', 'combined', 'most', 'beautiful', 'dance', 'sequences', 'could', 'imagine', 'way', 'Story', 'Vernon', 'Irene', 'Castle', 'just', 'as', 'memorable', 'earlier', 'great', 'together', 'Gay', 'Divorcee', 'Top', 'Hat', 'Swing', 'Time', '.The', 'look', 'production', 'really', 'beautiful', 'great', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'Indeed', 'often', 'think', 'film', 'MGM', 'look', 'so', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'appropiate', 'costumne', 'settings', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'who', 'stage', 'was', 'starting', 'branch', 'out', 'solo', 'work', 'other', 'leading', 'men', 'mixture', 'comedies', 'dramas', 'exceptional', 'Irene', 'mentions', 'autobiography', 'had', 'real', 'Irene', 'Castle', 'contend', 'production', 'creative', 'adviser', 'was', 'very', 'unnerving', 'experience', 'need', 'not', 'have', 'worried', 'wonderfully', 'balanced', 'piece', 'acting', 'here', 'character', 'beautifully', 'naive', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'sophisticated', 'woman', 'world', 'envy', 'woman', 'generation', 'particular', 'scenes', 'effect', 'women', 'time', 'are', 'beautifully', 'amusingly', 'done', 'influence', 'moving', 'fashion', 'face', 'cream', 'hair', 'styles', 'etc', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'saying', 'top', 'form', 'thi', 'sproduction', 'dancing', 'solo', 'numbers', 'combining', 'Ginger', 'are', 'real', 'joy', 'witness', 'reveal', 'why', 'regarded', 'greatest', 'dancer', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'great', 'feel', 'film', 'delivers', 'wonderfully', 'talented', 'character', 'actress', 'Edna', 'May', 'Oliver', 'supporting', 'performer', 'countless', 'memorable', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'plays', 'Maggie', 'Sutton', 'gruff', 'business', 'manager', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'Castle', 'progress', 'poverty', 'world', 'wide', 'success', 'ultimately', 'tragedy', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'very', 'able', 'support', 'Fred', 'friend', 'Walter', 'who', 'constant', 'presence', 'lives', 'also', 'Maggie', 'life', 'journey', 'Castles.For', 'who', 'love', 'fine', 'dancing', 'performed', 'masters', 'Story', 'Vernon', 'Irene', 'Castle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faulted', 'film', 'unique', 'Fred', 'Ginger', 'team', 'real', 'life', 'historical', 'characters', 'who', 'gave', 'joy', 'dancing', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'beautiful', 'production', 'wonderful', 'showcase', 'shining', 'talents', 'were', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Ginger', 'Rogers']",N/A
