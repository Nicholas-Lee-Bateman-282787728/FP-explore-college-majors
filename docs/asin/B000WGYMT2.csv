1109821,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000WGYMT2,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[3, 5]","It's been so, so long since I've watched the other two movies.To be honest, i remember nothing of the first movie which many think was the best.Of Part 2 I remember the little asian girl singing Mariah Carey's ""Fantasy"" in the car. She was JAMMIN'! haha...And the ending had a casino fight with a few thugs and I remember one of them, probably Chris, fighting this chick who was very good at fighting.They both were!But like I said it's been a LONG time so other parts are hazy or non-existent!!But this movie...it starts off with Tucker directing traffic (he's a police officer this time) and he's singing ""Do Me"" by an old-school singer, that I can't remember.It's not Stephanie Mills but it's one who came out around her time, I would think!The fight scenes were OK, the comedy was OK and the rest had a been there done that feel.It was underwhelming for sure and I didn't quite get through the whole movie.I got really tired and I turned it off because it was leaving a lot to be  desired.Shoot me down for not watching the whole thing but that's just how it went down.Before I leave you though, I must say that this movie was actually pretty racist also. Not towards blacks, but from blacks in a sense. Whoever wrote the script, gave Chris a few lines of ""funny"" Asian jokes such as the china man and other racist, predictable fodder that was to an extent funny, but not funny enough to be worth saying.He also has a line where he says to his partner in crime that he knows all he does eat is rice and such.2.7 stars.End note: Give me a bad rating if you want but all we have to do is look at the overall score. It reflects my opinion rather well. Don't get me wrong though. It wasn't a total bummer. There were funny parts. It's just that in between all that you were waiting for something...And the racist lines were rather rampant.",3,Very underwhelming.,1205193600,"03 11, 2008",2008,1839,"['been', 'so', 'so', 'long', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'other', 'two', 'movies.To', 'be', 'honest', 'i', 'remember', 'nothing', 'first', 'movie', 'many', 'think', 'was', 'best.Of', 'Part', '2', 'remember', 'little', 'asian', 'girl', 'singing', 'Mariah', 'Carey', 'Fantasy', 'car', 'was', 'JAMMIN', 'haha', 'ending', 'had', 'casino', 'fight', 'few', 'thugs', 'remember', 'one', 'probably', 'Chris', 'fighting', 'chick', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'fighting.They', 'were', 'said', 'been', 'LONG', 'time', 'other', 'parts', 'are', 'hazy', 'non-existent', 'movie', 'Tucker', 'directing', 'traffic', 'police', 'officer', 'time', 'singing', 'Do', 'Me', 'old-school', 'singer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember.It', ""'s"", 'not', 'Stephanie', 'Mills', 'one', 'who', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'would', 'think', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'OK', 'comedy', 'was', 'OK', 'rest', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'feel.It', 'was', 'underwhelming', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'whole', 'movie.I', 'got', 'really', 'tired', 'turned', 'off', 'was', 'leaving', 'lot', 'be', 'desired.Shoot', 'down', 'not', 'watching', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'how', 'went', 'down.Before', 'leave', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'racist', 'also', 'Not', 'blacks', 'blacks', 'sense', 'wrote', 'script', 'gave', 'Chris', 'few', 'lines', 'funny', 'Asian', 'jokes', 'such', 'china', 'man', 'other', 'racist', 'predictable', 'fodder', 'was', 'extent', 'funny', 'not', 'funny', 'enough', 'be', 'worth', 'saying.He', 'also', 'line', 'where', 'partner', 'crime', 'all', 'eat', 'rice', 'such.2.7', 'stars.End', 'note', 'Give', 'bad', 'rating', 'want', 'have', 'do', 'look', 'overall', 'score', 'opinion', 'rather', 'well', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', ""n't"", 'total', 'bummer', 'were', 'funny', 'parts', 'just', 'were', 'waiting', 'something', 'racist', 'lines', 'were', 'rather', 'rampant']",N/A
1109822,A1AUOVXPT5MYX4,B000WGYMT2,"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx""","[14, 21]","This is officially the worst film out of the ""Rush Hour"" series, and I was sorely disappointed. I understand that these movies are not meant to be monumental in quality. That didn't stop me from enjoying ""Rush Hour 1 and 2."" But in this third installment, the jokes have all run dry. This sequel best showcases Chris Tucker's weaknesses as a comic actor. He is undoubtedly a very funny stand-up comic, but unfortunately even the funniest stand-up comics don't always make smooth transitions to film. The problem with putting stand-up comics in movies is they have the tendency to improvise whenever possible. The problem is that they have to improvise within the parameters of each scene. They don't possess the same freedom and imagination they have when using their material on stage. It doesn't help that a lot of Tucker's material was recycled from the previous two films. The film opens with Tucker dancing like Michael Jackson in the middle of a busy L.A. street. Why is he doing that? Because people thought it was funny when he did it in the previous two films. There's no valid reason for his character to be listening to his I-Pod, singing and dancing along, when he should be directing traffic.Both Tucker and Jackie Chan seem to be going through the motions this time around. The chemistry is only barely there. Besides, the novelty has worn off by now. We get it. One's an Asian, by-the-numbers cop who doesn't speak much English and the other's a goofy LAPD detective who can't shut up. You can't expect to keep milking jokes out of that one premise.There are some spectacular action sequences, but as a comedy the film doesn't quite click. The jokes in the other ""Rush Hour"" flicks were pretty cheap, but in this one it didn't even feel like the filmmakers and actors were trying. The plot involves the unlikely duo going to France, so naturally we're bombarded by every French stereotype imaginable. Stereotypes can definitely be funny. As I've said in previous reviews, political correctness is the enemy of comedy. But when you recycle the same tired old stereotypes we've seen billions upon billions of times, how am I supposed to laugh? When the characters get to France, they hop into a cab with a French cab driver who hates Americans....because he's French. With movies like these, why shouldn't the French hate us Americans? And of course, we're bombarded by more tired Asian stereotypes. In one incredibly lame scene, there's a Chinese character named ""You"" and another named ""Me."" Hahaha, how friggin' original! So we're treated to another tired rendition of the classic ""Who's on the First"" act, with Tucker asking the character, ""Who are you?"" ""You."" ""What's your name?"" ""You."" I don't think I need to go on. It was bad enough when Morris Day and Jerome tried to re-create it in ""Purple Rain."" We don't need to suffer through it again. I hope Abbott and Costello rise from the grave and punch Brett Ratner in the face.On a happy note, the film did end with the song ""War, What Is It Good For?"" with Chan and Tucker dancing into the moonlight. That was one callback to the previous flicks that I can never get tired of.",2,This partnership has finally run dry,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,3146,"['officially', 'worst', 'film', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'series', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'understand', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'monumental', 'quality', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'enjoying', 'Rush', 'Hour', '1', '2', 'third', 'installment', 'jokes', 'have', 'run', 'dry', 'sequel', 'best', 'showcases', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'weaknesses', 'comic', 'actor', 'undoubtedly', 'very', 'funny', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'unfortunately', 'even', 'funniest', 'stand-up', 'comics', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'smooth', 'transitions', 'film', 'problem', 'putting', 'stand-up', 'comics', 'movies', 'have', 'tendency', 'improvise', 'whenever', 'possible', 'problem', 'have', 'improvise', 'parameters', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'possess', 'same', 'freedom', 'imagination', 'have', 'when', 'using', 'material', 'stage', ""n't"", 'help', 'lot', 'Tucker', 'material', 'was', 'recycled', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'film', 'Tucker', 'dancing', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'middle', 'busy', 'L.A.', 'street', 'Why', 'doing', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'when', 'did', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'valid', 'reason', 'character', 'be', 'listening', 'I-Pod', 'singing', 'dancing', 'along', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'directing', 'traffic.Both', 'Tucker', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'motions', 'time', 'around', 'chemistry', 'only', 'barely', 'there', 'Besides', 'novelty', 'worn', 'off', 'now', 'get', 'One', 'Asian', 'by-the-numbers', 'cop', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'much', 'English', 'other', 'goofy', 'LAPD', 'detective', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shut', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'keep', 'milking', 'jokes', 'one', 'are', 'spectacular', 'action', 'sequences', 'comedy', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'click', 'jokes', 'other', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'flicks', 'were', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'filmmakers', 'actors', 'were', 'trying', 'plot', 'unlikely', 'duo', 'going', 'France', 'so', 'naturally', ""'re"", 'bombarded', 'French', 'stereotype', 'imaginable', 'Stereotypes', 'can', 'definitely', 'be', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'said', 'previous', 'reviews', 'political', 'correctness', 'enemy', 'comedy', 'when', 'recycle', 'same', 'tired', 'old', 'stereotypes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'billions', 'billions', 'times', 'how', 'am', 'supposed', 'laugh', 'When', 'characters', 'get', 'France', 'hop', 'cab', 'French', 'cab', 'driver', 'who', 'Americans', 'French', 'movies', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'French', 'hate', 'Americans', 'course', ""'re"", 'bombarded', 'more', 'tired', 'Asian', 'stereotypes', 'one', 'incredibly', 'lame', 'scene', 'Chinese', 'character', 'named', 'named', 'Me', 'Hahaha', 'how', 'friggin', 'original', ""'re"", 'treated', 'tired', 'rendition', 'classic', 'Who', 'First', 'act', 'Tucker', 'asking', 'character', 'Who', 'are', 'What', 'name', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'go', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'when', 'Morris', 'Day', 'Jerome', 'tried', 're-create', 'Purple', 'Rain', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'suffer', 'again', 'hope', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'rise', 'grave', 'punch', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'face.On', 'happy', 'note', 'film', 'did', 'end', 'song', 'War', 'What', 'Good', 'Chan', 'Tucker', 'dancing', 'moonlight', 'was', 'one', 'callback', 'previous', 'flicks', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'tired']",N/A

1109824,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000WGYMT2,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","I stand by my belief that Chris Tucker is one of funniest actors out their right now.  Sure, not all of his film choices showcase the range I believe he possesses but the surface funny he brings to each and every performance is undeniable.  From the opening sequence to `Rush Hour 3' where Tuckers Carter is dancing in the streets we know that whether or not this film stacks up to the previous films is null and void, we are still going to laugh.Well, does it stack up?Sadly, `Rush Hour 3' (good lord, this really is the year of the trilogy isn't it) is not as good as it predecessors, but like I mentioned, it still brings some funny.  Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan reprise their roles as partners in crime (or crime-prevention) James Carter and Lee.  I had heard rumors before this film began filming that Chan was out and they were thinking of replacing him with another Asian actor.  I'm so thankful that this was not the case.  Had it been I would not have seen this film.  I don't believe in changing actors within a franchise.  Let's just say that as much as I loathe `Spider Mess 3' I'll see any film in the series UNLESS its stars are replaced.  Why do you think no one saw `XXX - State of the Union'?My point exactly.The plot behind `Rush Hour 3' is not really anything new.  In fact I could swear the same thing was done in `Rush Hour 2' or was it the original, but whatever, it's nothing new that's for sure.  The Ambassador Han from the first film is nearly assassinated and Lee and Carter try and track down the men responsible (someone very close to Lee) only to have Han's daughter (now all grown up) kidnapped in the process (yes, just like the first film).  Now Lee and Carter have to save her.  They threw in the search for Shai Shen but even that seems vaguely familiar.  Like I said, nothing original, which is a shame since they have had a LONG time to work up something better.  `Rush Hour 3' comes off a bit, what's the word, oh yeah...rushed.  Despite the long lapse in time from the filming of the second film to this installment it feels as if it was thrown together in weeks, not years.  Obviously this was not mulled over and thought through entirely.The action scenes are still thrilling and Chris Tucker is hilarious.  Jackie Chan has never really been the funny bone of the series, even though he has had his moments.  He has less of them here, but Tucker always knows when to pick up the slack.`Rush Hour 3' is predictable and uninspiring but it's funny; mindless funny fun.  I wouldn't necessarily `rush' to the rental store to check it out but if you want to complete the series (I doubt there will be a forth installment) then by all means check it out without fear or hesitation.  No, it's not as good as the first two, but it's not a buzz-kill either.  You'll laugh, I promise.",3,"Feels a tad rushed, but it's still funny...",1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,2815,"['stand', 'belief', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'one', 'funniest', 'actors', 'out', 'right', 'now', 'Sure', 'not', 'film', 'choices', 'showcase', 'range', 'believe', 'surface', 'funny', 'performance', 'undeniable', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Rush', '3', 'where', 'Tuckers', 'Carter', 'dancing', 'streets', 'know', 'not', 'film', 'up', 'previous', 'films', 'null', 'void', 'are', 'still', 'going', 'laugh.Well', 'stack', 'up', 'Sadly', 'Rush', '3', 'good', 'lord', 'really', 'year', 'trilogy', ""n't"", 'not', 'as', 'good', 'mentioned', 'still', 'funny', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'reprise', 'roles', 'partners', 'crime', 'crime-prevention', 'James', 'Carter', 'Lee', 'had', 'heard', 'rumors', 'film', 'began', 'filming', 'Chan', 'was', 'out', 'were', 'thinking', 'replacing', 'Asian', 'actor', ""'m"", 'so', 'thankful', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'Had', 'been', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'changing', 'actors', 'franchise', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'as', 'much', 'loathe', 'Spider', 'Mess', '3', ""'ll"", 'see', 'film', 'series', 'UNLESS', 'stars', 'are', 'replaced', 'Why', 'do', 'think', 'one', 'saw', 'XXX', 'State', 'Union', 'point', 'exactly.The', 'plot', 'Rush', '3', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'new', 'fact', 'could', 'swear', 'same', 'thing', 'was', 'done', 'Rush', '2', 'was', 'original', 'whatever', 'nothing', 'new', 'sure', 'Ambassador', 'Han', 'first', 'film', 'nearly', 'assassinated', 'Lee', 'Carter', 'try', 'track', 'down', 'men', 'responsible', 'someone', 'very', 'close', 'Lee', 'only', 'have', 'Han', 'daughter', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'kidnapped', 'process', 'yes', 'just', 'first', 'film', 'Now', 'Lee', 'Carter', 'have', 'save', 'threw', 'search', 'Shai', 'Shen', 'even', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'said', 'nothing', 'original', 'shame', 'have', 'had', 'LONG', 'time', 'work', 'up', 'something', 'better', 'Rush', '3', 'off', 'bit', 'what', 'word', 'oh', 'yeah', 'rushed', 'long', 'lapse', 'time', 'filming', 'second', 'film', 'installment', 'was', 'thrown', 'together', 'weeks', 'not', 'years', 'Obviously', 'was', 'not', 'mulled', 'thought', 'entirely.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'still', 'thrilling', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'hilarious', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'funny', 'bone', 'series', 'even', 'had', 'moments', 'less', 'here', 'Tucker', 'always', 'when', 'pick', 'up', 'slack.', 'Rush', '3', 'predictable', 'uninspiring', 'funny', 'mindless', 'funny', 'fun', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'rush', 'rental', 'store', 'check', 'out', 'want', 'complete', 'series', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'forth', 'installment', 'then', 'means', 'check', 'fear', 'hesitation', 'No', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'not', 'buzz-kill', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'promise']",N/A

How many off-color jokes and physical comedy routines does it take before things become old hat?If you've seen the previous two Rush Hour films, you already know exactly how this one pans out. Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) and Chief Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) reconnect when an attempt is taken on a Chinese official's life. Lee and Tucker are thrust back together to try and track down the villain(s).The usual suspects pop up, including an old ""brother""of Lee's named Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) and a diplomat named Varden Reynard (Max von Sydow,The Seventh Seal).A secret society. Carter and Lee get in way over their heads. They battle impossible foes doing equally impossible feats of daring duo all while being sprite, charming and funny.In the end, they come out smelling like roses.The end.Rumors of filming a fourth Rush Hour film immediately after this third installment were apparently scrapped due to unknown reasons, but one could easily venture that failing interest in the series hamstrung such a project (but who knows ...maybe there will be a fourth).Tucker and Chan still have a unique chemistry on-screen, one a speed talking black man and the other a soft talking Chinese gentleman. The blooper out-takes on the DVD are worth watching to check out Chan's difficulties with various English translations and his physical accident while trying to throw a piece of furniture with his legs (I've heard tell that he broke his sternum during that take. Ouch!).Plenty of eye-candy awaits those guys who like to see marvelously curvaceous women whom you normally would only see air-brushed on magazine covers.

I was underwhelmed by The stale gags that were very entertaining in Rush Hour 1&2 but were just stale in this one. Jackie Chan was actually Cris Tucker's sidekick here.  I would have liked a different plot that after such a time lag might have stood alone without the references to bits and pieces of the first 2 movies.The film opens with  Chris Tucker  directing traffic in a street cop uniform only to pick up a couple of girls.  Once again we see the Triad as a weak plot theme that brings us back to the Chinese ambassador and his now teen aged daughter with their lives in danger that the good Inspector Lee has to protect again.The friendly banter is not as funny between Chan and Tucker and although Jackie Chan can still do his own stunts, but  he is obviously not as young as he was when he was still doing his karate action stuff so the action sequences are more shoot em up and swinging from flying flags off the side of the Eifel Tower with a long lost ""brother"" from his past who we never heard about.  The Max Von Snydow character as the villain is underutilized as the French ambassador. And there is no plot tie up of loose ends.If you like the Rush Hour films, the film is watchable not as entertaining as the previous films. Paying full price for it would be  frustrating.

1109838,A2KWG1J285Z4QA,B000WGYMT2,David Baltazar,"[5, 7]","This review is from:Rush Hour 3 (Widescreen and Full-Screen)I really enjoyed Rush Hour 1 and 2. I thought the chemistry between the soft-spoken, but very acrobatic Jackie Chan and the motor-mouth Chris Tucker was very good for the first two films. The first Rush Hour worked well because we saw the culture change Jackie Chan experienced going to the United States and the second Rush Hour was humorous because we saw Chris Tucker experience the culture change in China. For the third and final act (hopefully final), both characters go to France, Europe to experience a new culture for both of them. However since Rush Hour 3 (2007) came nearly six years after Rush Hour 2 (2001) and Rush Hour 1 (1998), it seems the chemistry between Chan and Tucker dried up. I heard rumors that in real life the actors didn't like each other off screen.  Hard to believe if there was hatred between them when it looked fun while they were both singing and dancing to the ""War"" song in part one. If the rumors of their hatred for each other are true, than the efforts in part three can be justified.Other than the fantastic stunt scene on the Eiffel Tower, Rush Hour 3 looked like a ""rushed"" effort done only to simply complete a trilogy that perhaps should have never been completed. It seems nowadays all movies that have a part two MUST have a part three so that a trilogy DVD set can be sold in the future. Other than humor that is practically non-existent in part three and no memorable antagonist or villain to counter Chan & Tucker not much worked well. I really wanted to enjoy part three despite the bad theatrical reviews it initially got since I bought the Rush Hour 3 DVD during the Christmas holidays (when the DVD was first available) in order for my wife and I to watch something new on a quite evening alone. I think the film would have worked better if it got a better protagonist or villain to counter Chan & Tucker.  By the way I really liked Ziyi Zhang from part two in which she played a great villain (or femme fatale). Perhaps part three could have used another major actor to play the main villain such as Jason Statham (who could have fitted in some sort of Frenchman role) or Jet Li (not that Jackie Chan would have a fighting chance against Statham or Li). In the end I think the producers of Rush Hour 3 truly fumbled with this effort. I think the wait was too long, laughs were few, action ordinary and the effort rushed. 5 stars for part one & two, but only 2 stars for part three.",2,Maybe They Waited Too Long for Part Three?,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,2497,"['review', 'Rush', '3', 'Widescreen', 'Full-Screen', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Rush', 'Hour', '1', '2', 'thought', 'chemistry', 'soft-spoken', 'very', 'acrobatic', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'motor-mouth', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'first', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'worked', 'well', 'saw', 'culture', 'change', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'experienced', 'going', 'United', 'States', 'second', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'was', 'humorous', 'saw', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'experience', 'culture', 'change', 'China', 'third', 'final', 'act', 'hopefully', 'final', 'characters', 'go', 'France', 'Europe', 'experience', 'new', 'culture', 'However', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', '2007', 'came', 'nearly', 'six', 'years', 'Rush', 'Hour', '2', '2001', 'Rush', 'Hour', '1', '1998', 'chemistry', 'Chan', 'Tucker', 'dried', 'up', 'heard', 'rumors', 'real', 'life', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'other', 'off', 'screen', 'Hard', 'believe', 'was', 'hatred', 'when', 'looked', 'fun', 'were', 'singing', 'dancing', 'War', 'song', 'part', 'one', 'rumors', 'hatred', 'other', 'are', 'true', 'efforts', 'part', 'three', 'can', 'be', 'justified.Other', 'fantastic', 'stunt', 'scene', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'looked', 'rushed', 'effort', 'done', 'only', 'simply', 'complete', 'trilogy', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'completed', 'movies', 'have', 'part', 'two', 'MUST', 'have', 'part', 'three', 'trilogy', 'DVD', 'set', 'can', 'be', 'sold', 'future', 'Other', 'humor', 'practically', 'non-existent', 'part', 'three', 'memorable', 'antagonist', 'villain', 'counter', 'Chan', 'Tucker', 'not', 'much', 'worked', 'well', 'really', 'wanted', 'enjoy', 'part', 'three', 'bad', 'theatrical', 'reviews', 'initially', 'got', 'bought', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'holidays', 'when', 'DVD', 'was', 'first', 'available', 'order', 'wife', 'watch', 'something', 'new', 'quite', 'evening', 'alone', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'got', 'better', 'protagonist', 'villain', 'counter', 'Chan', 'Tucker', 'way', 'really', 'liked', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'part', 'two', 'played', 'great', 'villain', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Perhaps', 'part', 'three', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'major', 'actor', 'play', 'main', 'villain', 'such', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'fitted', 'sort', 'Frenchman', 'role', 'Jet', 'Li', 'not', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'would', 'have', 'fighting', 'chance', 'Statham', 'Li', 'end', 'think', 'producers', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'truly', 'fumbled', 'effort', 'think', 'wait', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'laughs', 'were', 'few', 'action', 'ordinary', 'effort', 'rushed', '5', 'stars', 'part', 'one', 'two', 'only', '2', 'stars', 'part', 'three']",N/A

1109843,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000WGYMT2,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","For those who have been fans of the previous two ""Rush Hour"" films, it had been six years since the second film and many people highly anticipating the reunion of Director Brett Ratner (""X-Men: The Last Stand"", ""Red Dragon"" and ""Money Talks"") and talents Jackie Chan (""Supercop"", ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""The Forbidden Kingdom"") and Chris Tucker (""Jackie Brown"", ""Money Talks"" and ""The Fifth Element"").Joining Brett is fellow ""Rush Hour 2"" screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (""The Terminal"", ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""Speed 2: Cruise Control""), composer Lalo Schifrin (""Mission: Impossible"" films, ""Money Talks"" and ""The Sting II"") and cinematographer J. Michael Muro (""Southland"", ""Traitor"" and ""Crash"").Because six years have passed, the film came out in the Summer of 2007 and with the excitement and comedy of the first two films, many fans were awaiting what would be in store for the third film.The film was not exactly well-received by critics but ""RUSH HOUR 3"" is a film that manages to bring people to theaters who want a comedy/action flick to enjoy for the Summer.  The film which cost $140 million to make, grossed over $255 million worldwide and thus, paving way for a new ""RUSH HOUR 4"" film scheduled anywhere between 2010-2012.VIDEO & AUDIO:When ""RUSH  HOUR 3"" was released on Blu-ray back in December 2007, the Blu-ray release received the highest marks for its picture and audio quality.  With the Blu-ray release now over a year old, I am revisiting the film and seeing how it compares to the current releases of today.The film sports a 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) transfer.  The film is definitely vibrant with many outdoor shots during the sunny day and detail featured during the Los Angeles and French scenes in the film.  The picture quality is not soft, lighting is definitely featured prominently in this film as its one thing to get vibrant colors during the outdoor scenes but in one nightclub scene, the colors that come through during the choreography screen shows how low-light combined with the various blue and purple lighting are equally vibrant and blacks are a nice and deep.Even today, ""RUSH HOUR 3"" is still a vibrant looking film that retains its grain and overall, a great looking film on Blu-ray.As for audio, I really enjoy these 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtracks and one thing you will notice from ""RUSH HOUR 3"" is that the soundtrack sounds absolutely nice.  Maybe not as much punch as a ""Quantum of Solace"" or ""Transformers: The Movie"" but the film manages to utilize all channels on my 7.2 system setup.  Rear surrounds are used primarily to enhance the music and certain sound effects which were nice.  Surrounds definitely made certain scenes feel immersive but for the most part, dialogue is clear (although some scenes by both Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan may be a bit difficult to understand at times and you may need to rewind the scene to better understand what is going on). Overall, a solid lossless audio soundtrack.As for subtitles, subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""RUSH HOUR 3' is definitely a Blu-ray release that deserves attention for picture and audio quality but the film also manages to include hours of special features which were quite enjoyable and all are featured in 1080p HD.DISC 1:* Audio commentary by Director Brett Rather and Jeff Nathanson - People can listen to the commentary throughout the film or by enabling the Enhanced Visual Commentary which features both men in a picture-in-picture screen.  The Enhanced Visual Commentary didn't need any changing of Blu-ray audio setup like some Blu-rays will need for P-I-P display.  But as far as the commentary is concerned, both men go into the making of the film, working with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker again and the other talents used in the film and much more.  A very entertaining commentary by both men.* Trailer - The original theatrical trailer for the film.DISC 2:* Outtakes - (2:33) The outtakes from the film.* Deleted/Alternate Scenes - (7:12) People can watch seven deleted and alternate scenes including an alternate ending with optional commentary by Director Brett Ratner and Screenwriter Jeff Nathanson.  Here is what is included:  Extended Airplane, Extended Taxi, Extended Elevator, Hotel Hallway, Spotlight Guy: Follies, Extended Eiffel Tower, and Alternate Ending.  For the most part, both are rather humorous when discussing these scenes, scenes they wish they didn't cut out but most interesting is Ratner and Nathanson's discussion about the alternative ending and not sure why they created that.* Making of ""RUSH HOUR 3' - (1:28:10) Literally, the making of ""RUSH HOUR 3' from the script to the cast and the music.  Interviews with crew and talent and more.  Very in-depth featurette of what Nathanson wanted to accomplish with the script and what Ratner wanted to accomplish with the casting a worldwide talent of characters and more.  Here is what is included in this segment (can be watched ala ""View All"" or separately):- The Story, The Script- Casting the Rush- Teaming Up- Creating the Rush: Scene by Scene- Cuts, Sound & Music* Visual Effects Reel - (2:03) An interesting look at various scenes and using digital characters instead of real life characters and going through scenes that looked real but were in CG.* Le Rush Hour Trois Production Diary -(1:05:05) A very candid look at Bret Ratner making ""Rush Hour 3' and the challenge the crew faced with the making of this film.  Including behind-the-scenes footage of certain scenes, what happened off camera and more.  Very fun to watch and informative.EASTER EGGS:There are two Easter Eggs.  The first is on Disc 2 and pressing up on ""Visual Effects Reel"" in the main menu.  You will see a logo show up and when you click on it, you will get a short video with Jackie Chan and Hiroyuki Sanada's characters fighting with light sabers.  The other is on subtitles and selecting the New Line Cinema logo to access credits for the film.JUDGMENT CALL:I really enjoyed ""RUSH HOUR"" and ""RUSH HOUR 2'.  Both films manage to showcase a good amount of humor and action and this odd couple manage to successfully bring in people to the theaters because you know that it's a fun film to watch.  Both Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are so unlike and they are the ultimate odd couple on screen but they manage to make it work.But ""RUSH HOUR"" films are not films to expect a deep storyline.  If anything, there are many racial jokes on both sides of the film and as evident from the special features, there are lines that Jackie Chan has no idea what he's saying, nor does he know what they mean.""RUSH HOUR 3' is simply a film that you just don't want to expect anything more from.  The laughs, the actions, the camaraderie are enough.But with the Ratner and crew trying to come up with a new story six years later, I felt the movie felt as if it was rushed.  I felt that the duo dynamic was subdued. Similar to the ""Odd Couple"", these two are quite the opposites and both Lee and Carter who have now become good friends, like brothers was fine but it's been far too long since these Ratner, Chan and Tucker have worked with each other.Chris Tucker did a fine role as Carter but for some reason, as much as I know Jackie Chan is a popular singer in Asia, I suppose that I wanted to see more action-based scenes with him rather than many singing scenes. It just seemed out of place. But knowing that Chan who was 53-years-old at the time, is not going to be doing a lot of action scenes as he did back in 1998 when the first film was released in theaters.  And if the fourth film is released in 2012, I'm not sure how much we can expect from, especially now as he wants to focus on serious films in Asia.Also, I felt the character of George (The taxi driver) was a bit overused.  Fine for the first time but seeing him evolve as a character, again, with the film focused on Lee and Carter, seeing the character George being so prominent seemed a bit off.Max von Sydow has always managed to have this mysterious allure to him.  From the 1975 film ""Three Days of the Condor"" to ""RUSH HOUR 3', the roles that he tends to play makes those familiar with his work automatically know where his character as Reynard is going to go.  But I felt there could have been much more potential with his character.I really enjoyed Hiroyuki Sanada as Kenji.  His role as an action star in Japan was definitely showcased in ""RUSH HOUR 3'.  It was also great to see Ratner utilizing other worldwide talents such as Jingchu Zhang, Youki Kudoh and Noemie Lenoir.But in the end, I was entertained by ""RUSH HOUR 3"".  There are some major laughs and action sequences in the film that manage to capture the soul of the ""RUSH HOUR"" films and on Blu-ray, you get a wonderful transfer with outstanding picture and audio quality and hours of special features which were enjoyable to watch.For fans of the film or the trilogy, ""RUSH HOUR 3"" is a wonderful Blu-ray release.  Unfortunately, the film's storyline doesn't quite match the awesomeness of the Blu-ray release but nevertheless, it's a very entertaining, solid Blu-ray!  Definitely worth checking out!",4,Blu-ray: The Blu-ray release is absolutely wonderful.  Awesome picture and audio quality plus two discs of special features.,1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,9159,"['who', 'have', 'been', 'fans', 'previous', 'two', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'films', 'had', 'been',

Stokes,"[2, 2]","The action this time takes Lee (Chan) and Carter (Tucker) to France, where there's something about a list of the leaders of the Triads.... oh, you don't care about that--the plot's only there to give a reason for the jokes and the stunts.Truly, the plot's a bit confusing. A diplomat who gets shot just as he was going to reveal the leaders of the Triads; a list of names tattooed on a woman's head; various factions after Lee and Carter and the woman and each other.The action and jokes are pretty much what you'd expect if you've seen the first 2 movies. One of the bad guys, however, is Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) Lee's ""brother"" (they'd grown up together), and that provides a nice bit of emotional conflict.The other thing that distinguishes this movie from the first two is the Paris setting, with a cool action sequence on the Eiffel Tower, but mostly with the sneering Parisian cab driver George (Yvan Attal), who provides even more laughs and ends up making a surprising ally. The addition of his character to the Tucker/Chan duo kept it fresh, not unlike an old married couple with a new audience for their stories. I also really enjoyed his rather skewed view of America--it's not actually all that exaggerated.It wasn't quite as good as the first two, but it was a fun way to spend an evening--we always enjoy Jackie Chan, even in his cheesiest movies (or maybe that's especially), and as my son's English teacher is wont to say, ""Chris Tucker is a funny man.""",3,"not as good as the first two, but fun anyway",1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,1469,"['action', 'time', 'Lee', 'Chan', 'Carter', 'Tucker', 'France', 'where', 'something', 'list', 'leaders', 'Triads', 'oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'plot', 'only', 'there', 'give', 'reason', 'jokes', 'stunts.Truly', 'plot', 'bit', 'confusing', 'diplomat', 'who', 'shot', 'just', 'was', 'going', 'reveal', 'leaders', 'Triads', 'list', 'names', 'tattooed', 'woman', 'head', 'various', 'factions', 'Lee', 'Carter', 'woman', 'other.The', 'action', 'jokes', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', '2', 'movies', 'One', 'bad', 'guys', 'however', 'Kenji', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'Lee', 'brother', ""'d"", 'grown', 'up', 'together', 'nice', 'bit', 'emotional', 'conflict.The', 'other', 'thing', 'movie', 'first', 'two', 'Paris', 'setting', 'cool', 'action', 'sequence', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'mostly', 'sneering', 'Parisian', 'cab', 'driver', 'George', 'Yvan', 'Attal', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'laughs', 'up', 'making', 'surprising', 'ally', 'addition', 'character', 'Tucker/Chan', 'duo', 'kept', 'fresh', 'not', 'old', 'married', 'couple', 'new', 'audience', 'stories', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'rather', 'skewed', 'view', 'America', 'not', 'actually', 'exaggerated.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'was', 'fun', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'always', 'enjoy', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'even', 'cheesiest', 'movies', 'maybe', 'especially', 'son', 'English', 'teacher', 'wont', 'say', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'funny', 'man']",N/A

It's obvious that they've remade the first film too many times.  Chris Tucker was enjoyable, as usual, and kept up his end of the proceedings.  Jackie Chan, unfortunately, was another matter.  I just couldn't get past the gloomy pall he put on this outing by abruptly turning dour and remorse at the most inopportune of times (he would no doubt argue that he needed to go ""dramatic"" because of the awkward intrusion of a non-brother, brother who popped out of his past).  I'd counter with that being the exact moment you'd need to go funny.  Hello, he wasn't your real brother, he was a bad guy...oh wait, didn't they pull that ruse in RH #2?  (They also reused another gambit employed in the first movie only this time he was played by Max von Sydow.)  The ""who's on first"" routine with ""me & you"" was desperate but Chris Tucker forced it into funny, not so funny was the bizarre rant against Americans in the French taxi; it left me wondering who they were trying to skewer, the French or us.  And speaking of French, so much of the dialog could/should have been translated with subtitles.  The worst offense though was the disconcerting (some would say creepy) inclusion of exiled director Roman Polanski as a brutal cop.  My jaw dropped on that one.  What were they thinking!This movie is a little above inept.  I did enjoy parts of it, some of the chase scenes/fight scenes, other parts were simply repetitious.  It's a keeper only because it's part of a set.  If it was a standalone movie, I'd ditch it in a heartbeat.Sadly, there is word of a possible Rush Hour 4.",3,Me & You?,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,1675,"['Unsatisfying', 'nicest', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'third', 'entry', 'otherwise', 'entertaining', 'series', 'obvious', ""'ve"", 'remade', 'first', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'usual', 'kept', 'up', 'end', 'proceedings', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'matter', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'gloomy', 'pall', 'put', 'outing', 'abruptly', 'turning', 'dour', 'remorse', 'most', 'inopportune', 'times', 'would', 'no', 'doubt', 'argue', 'needed', 'go', 'dramatic', 'awkward', 'intrusion', 'non-brother', 'brother', 'who', 'popped', 'past', ""'d"", 'counter', 'being', 'exact', 'moment', ""'d"", 'need', 'go', 'funny', 'Hello', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'brother', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'oh', 'wait', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'ruse', 'RH', '2', 'also', 'reused', 'gambit', 'employed', 'first', 'movie', 'only', 'time', 'was', 'played', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'who', 'first', 'routine', 'was', 'desperate', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'forced', 'funny', 'not', 'so', 'funny', 'was', 'bizarre', 'rant', 'Americans', 'French', 'taxi', 'left', 'wondering', 'who', 'were', 'trying', 'skewer', 'French', 'speaking', 'French', 'so', 'much', 'dialog', 'could/should', 'have', 'been', 'translated', 'subtitles', 'worst', 'offense', 'though', 'was', 'disconcerting', 'would', 'say', 'creepy', 'inclusion', 'exiled', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'brutal', 'cop', 'My', 'jaw', 'dropped', 'one', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'movie', 'little', 'above', 'inept', 'did', 'enjoy', 'parts', 'chase', 'scenes/fight', 'scenes', 'other', 'parts', 'were', 'simply', 'repetitious', 'keeper', 'only', 'part', 'set', 'was', 'standalone', 'movie', ""'d"", 'ditch', 'heartbeat.Sadly', 'word', 'possible', 'Rush', 'Hour', '4']",N/A

1109849,A3CRB8AHFDKWP4,B000WGYMT2,Esteban,"[1, 1]","Rush Hour 3 is definitely the least enjoyable out of the series. And there are multiple reasons why. Rush Hour 3 overall seems like a movie that didn't have as much thought put into it as the previous installments. The jokes and acting both seem forced. Even the stunts seemed forced and not nearly as fun or exciting as the ones from the previous Rush Hours.The storyline also seems very lackadaisical. During the first two Rush Hour movies, I NEVER found myself getting bored. However, during Rush Hour 3, I actually had to force myself to pay attention because I found many of the scenes to be lackluster, watered-down and rehashed. In Rush Hour 2, when Carter got onstage and began singing &#34;Don't Stop til You Get Enough&#34;, it was actually funny, charming, and memorable. This time around when something similar happens, it seems predictable and recycled. It seems like the writers of this movie took different scenes from the first two Rush Hours and decided to try to redo them here and the results are really bland and unoriginal. Even Jackie seems like he doesn't even want to be there anymore (it turns out that I was correct about that feeling) and he and Tucker's chemistry is nowhere near the level that it used to be. Also, the scene where Genevieve takes off her wig and Carter continues to insist that she's a man was SUPPOSED to be funny, but came off as a corny attempt, as Carter continued to run the already not so funny joke into the ground.I REALLY wanted to like this movie, before I had even sat down to watch it. But like many others have stated, it definitely falls short. The whole movie has a &#34;been there, done that&#34; feel to it. The first two Rush Hours were hilarious, charming, and fresh. Rush Hour 3 seems forced and many of the jokes fall flat and seem stale. Some people say it's because they waited too long (about 6 years) to make a third installment. This resulted in rusty acting from both Chan and Tucker, thrown off chemistry, and a bunch of rushed scenes that don't really make sense or have much comedic charm. If you are a fan of the first two Rush Hours, I'd say that you definitely won't be missing anything if you decide to skip Rush Hour 3. There weren't any laugh out loud moments like there were in the previous two. If you decide to check it out, proceed at your own risk, but don't expect to have as fun as a ride as you did during Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2.",2,Third time isn't always a charm....,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,2422,"['Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'definitely', 'least', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'are', 'multiple', 'reasons', 'why', 'Rush', '3', 'overall', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'put', 'previous', 'installments', 'jokes', 'acting', 'seem', 'forced', 'Even', 'stunts', 'seemed', 'forced', 'not', 'nearly', 'fun', 'exciting', 'ones', 'previous', 'Rush', 'Hours.The', 'storyline', 'also', 'very', 'lackadaisical', 'first', 'two', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'movies', 'NEVER', 'found', 'getting', 'bored', 'However', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'actually', 'had', 'force', 'pay', 'attention', 'found', 'many', 'scenes', 'be', 'lackluster', 'watered-down', 'rehashed', 'Rush', 'Hour', '2', 'when', 'Carter', 'got', 'onstage', 'began', 'singing', '34', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'til', 'Get', 'Enough', '34', 'was', 'actually', 'funny', 'charming', 'memorable', 'time', 'around', 'when', 'something', 'similar', 'happens', 'predictable', 'recycled', 'writers', 'movie', 'took', 'different', 'scenes', 'first', 'two', 'Rush', 'Hours', 'decided', 'try', 'redo', 'here', 'results', 'are', 'really', 'bland', 'unoriginal', 'Even', 'Jackie', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'be', 'there', 'anymore', 'out', 'was', 'correct', 'feeling', 'Tucker', 'chemistry', 'nowhere', 'level', 'used', 'be', 'Also', 'scene', 'where', 'Genevieve', 'wig', 'Carter', 'insist', 'man', 'was', 'SUPPOSED', 'be', 'funny', 'came', 'off', 'corny', 'attempt', 'Carter', 'continued', 'run', 'already', 'not', 'so', 'funny', 'joke', 'ground.I', 'REALLY', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'had', 'even', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'definitely', 'short', 'whole', 'movie', '34', 'been', 'there', 'done', '34', 'feel', 'first', 'two', 'Rush', 'Hours', 'were', 'hilarious', 'charming', 'fresh', 'Rush', '3', 'forced', 'many', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'seem', 'stale', 'people', 'say', 'waited', 'too', 'long', '6', 'years', 'make', 'third', 'installment', 'resulted', 'rusty', 'acting', 'Chan', 'Tucker', 'thrown', 'off', 'chemistry', 'bunch', 'rushed', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'have', 'much', 'comedic', 'charm', 'are', 'fan', 'first', 'two', 'Rush', 'Hours', ""'d"", 'say', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'anything', 'decide', 'skip', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'were', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'moments', 'were', 'previous', 'two', 'decide', 'check', 'out', 'proceed', 'own', 'risk', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'have', 'as', 'fun', 'ride', 'did', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'Rush', 'Hour', '2']",N/A

I had never heard of the Rush Hour movies before, but I thought they might make an interesting variation in the things that I watch as late-night entertainment. It did. ""Rush Hour"" was quite amusing in a strange way, I followed it up the next night with ""Rush Hour 2"" and it was very much the same way, except less so. Maybe I was burning out. So I took a break. Last night, my movie was ""Rush Hour 3."" Alas, I was very disappointed. It was just a weak imitation of the previous two.""Rush Hour 3"" takes place largely in Paris, in contrast to Los Angeles and Hong Kong of the previous two, and is centered about the Eiffel Tower. Well, why not? It would give rise to some spectacular stunt scenes. Alas, the stunts are just not that good and nowhere near  the things observed in the original ""Rush Hour.""

I think they went for the same formula on the third one by taking them to France after being in LA for a while but it just wasn't entertaining.Sure, there were a few spots of humor here and there.  When a French cab drivers insults Halle Barry in front of Chris Tucker his reaction made me laugh out loud.  However, this movie just never grabbed me.To be honest, this reminds me of this great teacher I had.  When I first took his class he was funny and entertaining.  What made him really stand out was his great repertoire of one-liners that had the classroom rolling.  So when he was teaching another class I was excited to sign up and found that his silliness started wearing off on me and his ""great repertoire"" was actually the same old jokes from the previous class.  Though there wasn't anything different, it was just boring anyways.This movie is like that.  There wasn't anything to keep this fresh, it was just a rehashing of the first two movies again.  Even references to ""Mu shoo"" were there like the makers thought we would still be laughing at that joke.  Come on, its old now.  The only thing they did to try and keep this fresh was filming it in Europe but I think this movie needed more.  Even Shrek needed to bring in new sidekicks to keep things fresh.In the end, I never finished this movie.  Halfway though my son asked me if I wanted to play Guitar Hero and I thought that would be more entertaining.  After a few days I realized I never finished the movie and then realized again I had no desire to.Unless Rush Hour still tickles your fancy I'd just avoid this one.

Still, this movie is worth a rental or buying on DVD and Blu Ray if you have the cash! Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker return as Lee and Carter. I think Brett Ratner is the ""real star"" of this movie! The film's trailer uses a record scratch when someone tells a lame joke! The ""Chinglish"" scene was funny. There's rumors that a Rush Hour 4 is in the works.

1109867,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000WGYMT2,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[4, 6]","What do you call a movie that has no originality; paper thing story; big plot holes; forced humor; stereotypes and almost no laughs? Rush Hour 3 is your answer. This tiresome sequel from the Chan-Tucker team brings absolutely nothing new to the table. They all came back for the big paycheck and it's so painfully obvious. Tucker--the big winner here, financially speaking--doesn't even try anything new with his predictable humor and Chan looks tired and boring the whole time. I hope it all ends here because I don't like how they filmmakers deliberately recycle old materials to make a so called ""new"" film of this franchise.Brief Intro Story:Few years have passed and now Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) is a funny traffic cop, and Chief inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) is still a bodyguard for the Chinese Ambassador Han who is scheduled to give a speech at the embassy about the biggest crime organization in the world--the Chinese Triads. As he is giving the speech, he gets shot by a sniper. Chan goes after the shooter, but once they get face to face, he lets him go. Tucker appears at the scene but it's too late.The Ambassador survived the shooting, but he is the hospital and needs protection. His daughter Soo Yung also shows up to see his condition. Meanwhile a group of killers also show up at the hospital to finish the job--the Ambassador is moved to another room, a la Godfather. The shooting begins and predictably our duo wins and captures a Chinese-French hostage that tells them that the key of this mystery is in Paris. They go to Paris to find out who is behind this.Review:The only thing I found hysterically funny about this sequel is the large amount of plot holes--for example; no cops to protect the Ambassador at the hospital, Tucker becoming a detective after being just a traffic cop, Ambassador's daughter ending up in Paris and so forth. Also the story itself is just a recycled version of the previous films--with just a small little twist that you can see it coming from a mile away. How many times have we seen the veteran actor Max von Sydow being the double-face guy? We get no originality from director Brett Ratner who brags about making films in no time--it definitely shows. Well, it also shows Chris Tucker's humor that is predictable, average, and for him, easy to generate--He can do this without too much effort, so let's not give him a lot of credit for it. Unfortunately Jackie Chan is not that great either. He looks bored and tired throughout the film. Does he really want to be in this third installment? His age definitely shows because his stuns are simpler and uses body doubles. He does, however, pulled few good stuns, but nothing like the previous films.Besides the beat-to-death racial stereotypes and gratuitous partial nudity, we find another ""great"" accomplishment by the writer Jeff Nathanson who knows how to put America down by adding a hateful French taxi driver who bashes American international policy--in that uncomfortable moment, the audience went dead silence. Is it funny to talk like that? Sadly for some, it is. Thank you for reminding us about the hostility from the rest of the world and the terrible danger that we as a nation face everyday.The Verdict:Rush Hour 3 is a mechanical affair created solely to bring to the masses cheap mindless humor and collect some big paychecks for everyone involved in it. Nothing really stands out from the franchise that seems to be getting worse as time goes by. It just doesn't have the charm and fun of the previous films.",2,Just  Big Paychecks for Everyone Involved in it,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,3541,"['What', 'do', 'call', 'movie', 'originality', 'paper', 'thing', 'story', 'big', 'plot', 'holes', 'forced', 'humor', 'stereotypes', 'almost', 'laughs', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'answer', 'tiresome', 'sequel', 'Chan-Tucker', 'team', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'new', 'table', 'came', 'back', 'big', 'paycheck', 'so', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Tucker', 'big', 'winner', 'here', 'financially', 'speaking', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'anything', 'new', 'predictable', 'humor', 'Chan', 'tired', 'boring', 'whole', 'time', 'hope', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'deliberately', 'recycle', 'old', 'materials', 'make', 'so', 'called', 'new', 'film', 'franchise.Brief', 'Intro', 'Story', 'Few', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'now', 'Detective', 'James', 'Carter', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'funny', 'traffic', 'cop', 'Chief', 'inspector', 'Lee', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'still', 'bodyguard', 'Chinese', 'Ambassador', 'Han', 'who', 'scheduled', 'give', 'speech', 'embassy', 'biggest', 'crime', 'organization', 'world', 'Chinese', 'Triads', 'giving', 'speech', 'shot', 'sniper', 'Chan', 'shooter', 'once', 'get', 'face', 'face', 'go', 'Tucker', 'scene', 'too', 'late.The', 'Ambassador', 'survived', 'shooting', 'hospital', 'protection', 'daughter', 'Soo', 'Yung', 'also', 'up', 'see', 'condition', 'Meanwhile', 'group', 'killers', 'also', 'show', 'up', 'hospital', 'finish', 'job', 'Ambassador', 'moved', 'room', 'la', 'Godfather', 'shooting', 'predictably', 'duo', 'wins', 'Chinese-French', 'hostage', 'key', 'mystery', 'Paris', 'go', 'Paris', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'this.Review', 'only', 'thing', 'found', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'sequel', 'large', 'amount', 'plot', 'holes', 'example', 'cops', 'protect', 'Ambassador', 'hospital', 'Tucker', 'becoming', 'detective', 'being', 'just', 'traffic', 'cop', 'Ambassador', 'daughter', 'ending', 'up', 'Paris', 'so', 'forth', 'Also', 'story', 'just', 'recycled', 'version', 'previous', 'films', 'just', 'small', 'little', 'twist', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'being', 'double-face', 'guy', 'get', 'originality', 'director', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'who', 'brags', 'making', 'films', 'time', 'definitely', 'Well', 'also', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'humor', 'predictable', 'average', 'easy', 'generate', 'can', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'let', 'not', 'give', 'lot', 'credit', 'Unfortunately', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'not', 'great', 'bored', 'tired', 'film', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'third', 'installment', 'age', 'definitely', 'stuns', 'are', 'simpler', 'body', 'doubles', 'however', 'pulled', 'few', 'good', 'stuns', 'nothing', 'previous', 'beat-to-death', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'gratuitous', 'partial', 'nudity', 'find', 'great', 'accomplishment', 'writer', 'Jeff', 'Nathanson', 'who', 'how', 'put', 'America', 'down', 'adding', 'hateful', 'French', 'taxi', 'driver', 'who', 'American', 'international', 'policy', 'uncomfortable', 'moment', 'audience', 'went', 'dead', 'silence', 'funny', 'talk', 'Sadly', 'Thank', 'reminding', 'hostility', 'rest', 'world', 'terrible', 'danger', 'nation', 'face', 'everyday.The', 'Verdict', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'mechanical', 'affair', 'created', 'solely', 'bring', 'masses', 'cheap', 'mindless', 'humor', 'collect', 'big', 'paychecks', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Nothing', 'really', 'out', 'franchise', 'be', 'getting', 'worse', 'time', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'charm', 'fun', 'previous', 'films']",N/A

However, I very much enjoyed this movie.There is no ground breaking acting or film-making here...the same formula is in place...a buddy movie of action and comedy.  I really enjoyed the first movie, but Rush Hour 2 was just a little more bland.  Rush Hour was one of the first that coupled Jackie Chan with an American star to fuse his martial arts skills with comedy.  While I am not a big fan of Chris Tucker, I found myself liking this duo.  An African-American Comedian paired together with an Asian Action Martial Arts Legend for an action/comedy worked for me.  Now on its third installment seemed on face value to be an uninteresting stretch of the original and only out to make a quick buck.  However,after watching this as a rental I bought a copy.  This movie delivered as an entertaining reworking of the formula.This movie finds them headed to Paris to find the assassin who attempts the Chinese Ambassador's life.  We find out that Jackie Chan's character was in an orphanage and has a connection of some sort of ""brotherhood"" with another boy that turns to a life of crime.  Now Jackie Chan is on a mission to bring down the Triads, despite his ""brother's"" involvement.  Chris Tucker continues to keep things funny with his stylish dancing, singing and comedic cop blunders...Jackie Chan continues to impress with his still agile martial arts moves.Take this movie on face value...an entertaining action comedy that puts a slightly new twist on the same formula.

I've always enjoyed the choreography of Jackie Chan's fight/flight scenes. But even these parts of the film are marred. For one thing, Chris Tucker intrudes on most of these parts without actually doing anything more than saying unfunny things (i.e: ""I know he's your brother, but make him into your sister!""). The other thing is, well, I suspect Chan has finally gone the way of stunt doubles for some of the work--and some of it is clearly enhanced by CGI.The movie also insults the viewer with plot threads that don't make sense.

Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[1, 1]","I remember thinking, when this movie came out.....Not too sure if I want to go and pay $8 at the movie theater, but I will see it when it comes out on DVD (rent not purchase). I added that to my ever growing list of ""movies to rent"" and forgot about it. So imagine my delight when I saw that it was on by Demand (what I think is the best invention in years...no lines, no waiting to see the movie, just sit at home and order it). Now I already knew that the Rush Hour movies are similar to the Matrix movies in that, you can't wait for the next one to come out, but deep down you know that it couldn't possibly be as good as the first. I see Chris Tucker around Atlanta on occassion, and even remember seeing him do standup locally before he was in Friday....he is usually very funny. But in Rush Hour 3, with a few pounds (and I know we all have gained them) he just wasn't as funny as he usually is. And the usual farter that happens between he and Jackie Chan didn't appear as effortless as in the previous installments of the Rush Hour series. And it is obvious that Jackie has aged as well because we were not privy to as many fighting scenes as he normally gives us.Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan)and LAPD Detective Carter (Chris Tucker) have made a promise to the daughter of the Ambassador (again) that they will discover who shot her father while he was attempting to uncover the identity of the leader of an elusive secret organization. Pursuiting leads to Paris, we see the merry, yet reluctant pair bantering about their friendship and trying to understand who is behind everything. Tucker meets a beautiful woman, and Chan discovers something about a family member that he just doesn't want to accept while having several dangerous encounters with a knife carrying woman.I gave this movie a 2 for the following reasons: (1) there were so many references to past Rush Hour movies, that if you have never seen the previous movies, you would have no idea who and what they were talking about. Even the main storyline....the one involving the ambassador referred back to the 1st movie. So when Tucker kept referring to the little girl and then a young adult hugged him, most people would probably not know what was going on. The references to Chan's Secret Service Agent girlfriend, and other mishaps were from other movies. Perhaps it would have been better had they created a movie that could have stood alone. (2) I have grown tired of Chris Tucker acting silly during times when he shouldn't. I would have preferred Tucker to really dig his teeth in the roll and really come up with something original, especially since it seems that he will only do Chan movies (these have been the only movies he has done in the last few years). What I do like about all of these Rush Hour Moviews are the outtakes at the end.

1109889,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B000WGYMT2,Mike Zimmerman,"[2, 3]","Cops James Carter (Chris Tucker) and Lee (Jackie Chan) have since broken apart after an accident forced Lee and Isabella Molina to break up. But that is the least of Lee's problems, as he is assisting Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma), who plans on giving an adress to the World Criminal Court Summit that will reveal information about Triad gangs. However, not is all pleasant, and Han gets shot by whom appears to be Lee's brother Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada). It doesn't end well, what with Carter getting in the way and letting Kenji escape. After hearing that another World Criminal Court Summit in Paris, France will be the next target of attack, Carter and Lee take off to France to beat the Triads. The duo also meet an angry cab driver (Max von Sidow), a flamboyant French detective (Roman Pulanski), and a nightclub performer (No&#65533;mie Lenoir).Due to a six-year wait, there's no doubt that ""Rush Hour 3"" couldn't have come out at a worse time. There was that whole drama with Chris Tucker aiming to get extra billing and the go-ahead to executive produce. Meanwhile, the action-comedy genre changed in different ways after Edgar Wright sended up the genre with ""Hot Fuzz"". Brett Ratner may not be able to overcome all these obstacles (except for Tucker, who still can wring out a laugh after six years in abscence), but he still offers a delectable entr&#65533; that refuses to bow down in terms of entertainment.""RH3"" may also have to live up to the second installment. Probably what I most remember about that film was the closing action scene where Lee and Carter jumped out of the Red Dragon in Las Vegas before being incinerated by a female assassin holding a bomb, then sliding down a pole and into a moving truck. Lee ran across it, while Carter just fell into it some times. It also helped win a best action scene at the 2002 MTV Movie Awards. Oh, and that film had a more rambunctious playground for Chan and Tucker to improv and break apart.Things calmed down with ""RH3"", at least for the beginning. As usual, Carter and Lee are traveling across various places in LA and Paris, running into a very large kung fu teacher (played by Sun Ming Ming), running into a brothel (a very funny scene where Carter thinks Lee is tearing an Asian girl's butt up), dealing with the angry cab driver, and a couple more situations that I dare not give away.Ratner can also film a couple good action scenes, with inspirations from John Woo (much like in the first one, Carter gets to fire two guns a la Chow Yun Fat, which shows Chris Tucker's newfound acrobatic skills that were hinted in ""Rush Hour 2"") to the Bruce Lee/Kareem Abdul Jabar film ""Game of Death"" (the aforementioned episode with Sun Ming Ming and Chris Tucker). The latter one, while not gut-bustingly funny, is very creative on Ratner's part. Hey, this guy did a good job in the last ""X-Men"" movie, so never doubt his Midas touch of directing solid scenes that rouse.Even after six years, Chan and Tucker are still strong with their chemistry. Chan, even at the age of 53, is still capable of kicking up the action (pun intended) and offering some of the film's funniest lines (that even includes the outtakes, where he offers choices of what ""dirty movie"" he should play). Tucker hasn't waned much either, despite some old-hat lines that would've held up better in the '90s (especially during his love scene with No&#65533;mie Lenoir), what with his hilarious rendition of a classic Prince song and a funny musical number with Chan. Put these two together, and really, what could possibly go wrong?For the finale, Ratner kicks things up a notch or two with an amazing fight scene at the Eiffel Tower. The director hardly overcompensates any lack of flair (though Industrial Light & Magic fills in any empty vessels in case of emergency), nor does Chan, as his swash-buckling with Hiroyuki Sanada is a sight to behold. I don't know if it will get any nods at next year's MTV Movie Awards, but it perfectly sums up the experience one viewer will have watching ""RH3"". Ratner may have to ride backseat of Edgar Wright, but I was genuinely happy with what he had to offer, and I hope it doesn't fade away any time soon.",4,"""You are a superfreak!""",1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,4175,"['Cops', 'James', 'Carter', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'Lee', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'have', 'broken', 'apart', 'accident', 'forced', 'Lee', 'Isabella', 'Molina', 'break', 'up', 'least', 'Lee', 'problems', 'assisting', 'Ambassador', 'Han', 'Tzi', 'Ma', 'who', 'giving', 'adress', 'World', 'Criminal', 'Court', 'Summit', 'will', 'reveal', 'information', 'Triad', 'gangs', 'However', 'not', 'pleasant', 'Han', 'shot', 'whom', 'be', 'Lee', 'brother', 'Kenji', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', ""n't"", 'end', 'well', 'what', 'Carter', 'getting', 'way', 'letting', 'Kenji', 'escape', 'hearing', 'World', 'Criminal', 'Court', 'Summit', 'Paris', 'France', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'target', 'attack', 'Carter', 'Lee', 'take', 'off', 'France', 'beat', 'Triads', 'duo', 'also', 'meet', 'angry', 'cab', 'driver', 'Max', 'von', 'Sidow', 'flamboyant', 'French', 'detective', 'Roman', 'Pulanski', 'nightclub', 'performer', 'No', '65533', 'Lenoir', '.Due', 'six-year', 'wait', 'doubt', 'Rush', '3', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'out', 'worse', 'time', 'was', 'whole', 'drama', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'aiming', 'get', 'extra', 'billing', 'go-ahead', 'executive', 'produce', 'Meanwhile', 'action-comedy', 'genre', 'changed', 'different', 'ways', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'sended', 'up', 'genre', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'Tucker', 'who', 'still', 'can', 'wring', 'out', 'laugh', 'six', 'years', 'abscence', 'still', 'delectable', 'entr', '65533', 'bow', 'down', 'terms', 'entertainment', 'RH3', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'live', 'up', 'second', 'installment', 'Probably', 'what', 'most', 'remember', 'film', 'was', 'closing', 'action', 'scene', 'where', 'Lee', 'Carter', 'jumped', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'being', 'incinerated', 'female', 'assassin', 'holding', 'bomb', 'then', 'sliding', 'down', 'pole', 'moving', 'truck', 'Lee', 'ran', 'Carter', 'just', 'fell', 'times', 'also', 'helped', 'win', 'best', 'action', 'scene', '2002', 'MTV', 'Movie', 'Awards', 'Oh', 'film', 'had', 'more', 'rambunctious', 'playground', 'Chan', 'Tucker', 'improv', 'break', 'apart.Things', 'calmed', 'down', 'RH3', 'least', 'beginning', 'usual', 'Carter', 'Lee', 'are', 'traveling', 'various', 'places', 'LA', 'Paris', 'running', 'very', 'large', 'kung', 'fu', 'teacher', 'played', 'Sun', 'Ming', 'Ming', 'running', 'brothel', 'very', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'Carter', 'Lee', 'tearing', 'Asian', 'girl', 'butt', 'up', 'dealing', 'angry', 'cab', 'driver', 'couple', 'more', 'situations', 'dare', 'not', 'give', 'away.Ratner', 'can', 'also', 'film', 'couple', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'inspirations', 'John', 'Woo', 'much', 'first', 'one', 'Carter', 'fire', 'two', 'guns', 'la', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'newfound', 'acrobatic', 'skills', 'were', 'hinted', 'Rush', '2', 'Bruce', 'Lee/Kareem', 'Abdul', 'Jabar', 'film', 'Game', 'Death', 'aforementioned', 'episode', 'Sun', 'Ming', 'Ming', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'latter', 'one', 'not', 'gut-bustingly', 'funny', 'very', 'creative', 'Ratner', 'part', 'Hey', 'guy', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'last', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'so', 'never', 'doubt', 'Midas', 'touch', 'directing', 'solid', 'scenes', 'rouse.Even', 'six', 'years', 'Chan', 'Tucker', 'are', 'still', 'strong', 'chemistry', 'Chan', 'even', 'age', '53', 'still', 'capable', 'kicking', 'up', 'action', 'pun', 'intended', 'offering', 'film', 'funniest', 'lines', 'even', 'outtakes', 'where', 'choices', 'what', 'dirty', 'movie', 'should', 'play', 'Tucker', ""n't"", 'waned', 'much', 'old-hat', 'lines', 'would', ""'ve"", 'held', 'up', 'better', ""'90s"", 'especially', 'love', 'scene', 'No', '65533', 'Lenoir', 'what', 'hilarious', 'rendition', 'classic', 'Prince', 'song', 'funny', 'musical', 'number', 'Chan', 'Put', 'two', 'together', 'really', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'finale', 'Ratner', 'things', 'up', 'notch', 'two', 'amazing', 'fight', 'scene', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'director', 'hardly', 'lack', 'flair', 'Industrial', 'Light', 'Magic', 'empty', 'vessels', 'case', 'emergency', 'Chan', 'swash-buckling', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'sight', 'behold', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'get', 'nods', 'next', 'year', 'MTV', 'Movie', 'Awards', 'perfectly', 'up', 'experience', 'one', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'watching', 'RH3', 'Ratner', 'may', 'have', 'ride', 'backseat', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'was', 'genuinely', 'happy', 'what', 'had', 'offer', 'hope', ""n't"", 'fade', 'away', 'time', 'soon']",N/A

To bring continuity to the sequels, some old characters are brought back.  Rather than having a constructive and tight script, Rush Hour Three builds story around the gags that enables Jackie and Chris to shine.  What I find uncomfortable about this movie is having French characters proclaiming their love for the United States and if I were the French actors, I would be even embarrassed to do so.  Then, there are plots that are so inconceivable and so illogical.  Anyhow, Max von Sydow is clearly underutilised.  Chris and Jackie's gags are running thin after a while and the outakes are actually the one to look forward to.  Brett Ratner, the Director could have done better and I'm sure that both Chris and Jackie could have done better too.

Granted, the plot is quite thin, and the series no longer has the new car smell of the first film.But for me, it was fun to see Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker back in action. Chan as Hong Kong Inspector Lee and Tucker as LAPD Detective Carter make a great action-comedy buddy-cop duo. In fact, they are my favorite such pair. They still have great chemistry and play off each other very well. They are as hilarious in this movie as they are in the first two, especially as always in the outtakes.Series director Brett Ratner is no slouch behind the camera, either. He has crafted yet another glossy, globetrotting affair, with Carter and Lee tracking the lethal Chinese Triad gang from Los Angeles to Paris. There, our heroes run afoul of a wacky French cop played by Roman Polanski, get driven around town in wild car chases by a local taxicab driver who fulfills his lifelong fantasy of being an American superspy, and face off with the bad guys in a spectacular climactic showdown at the Eiffel Tower.

This one however, just fell flat.  The action scenes were not of the caliber, quality or ingenuity of the previous films, or of a standard Jackie Chan film.  And as for the comedy, it really wasn't that funny.  The movie felt as if large parts of the dialogue were unscripted in the hopes that Chris Tucker would ""Say something funny"" which never happened.  Sure there were a few lines that made me smile, but nothing made me actually laugh.  The plot would have been okay if it hadn't been used already in a previous Rush Hour (spoiler: bad guy is posing as a friend who sent you to get bad guy in first place) then you add in the tired old ""It's his brother/sister/dad"" part of the plot, which I hope was not supposed to be a twist, because I figured it out as soon as they introduced him.The biggest problem with this movie is that it is a rehash of Rush Hour 1 without everything that made Rush Hour 1 so charming, which was watching the two of them get to know eachother.  Chan takes the back seat in this picture to Tucker who, for some reason seems to be wandering blindly through the movie.  The only good addition to the film was the French Cab Driver.  Other than that, we just have a bunch of Tucker and Chan getting threatened, running away, getting caught, bursting into song, being attacked, chasing bad guys and bursting into song again.  Which seems like the formula for most good action flicks (other than the bursting into song part) only this one just doesn't fit together as well and doesn't have the heart that the others did.Is the movie overall terrible?

Zwick,"[4, 8]","**1/2Like the two previous installments in the series, ""Rush Hour 3"" is an uneven mixture of low-ball humor and kick-ass action, with the amazingly nimble and athletic Jackie Chan once again playing the karate-chopping straight man to Chris Tucker's wisecracking cynic.In this edition, detectives Carter and Lee go from the mean streets of LA to the cafes and sewers of Paris to find and protect a French woman who possesses information of great value to some sort of secret international organization.  Since the plot feels as if it were pretty much hammered out in a late night storyboarding conference, the filmmakers are forced to rely even more heavily on the charisma of the two lead actors than they did before; luckily, Chan and Tucker, intrepid troopers that they are, pretty much deliver what is asked of them in that regard.I wish I could say the same for the screenplay by Jeff Nathanson and the direction by Brett Ratner.  For the most part, however, the humor in ""RH3"" is sub standard and derivative - a pale imitation of the classic ""Who's on First?"" comedy routine is particularly unfortunate and embarrassing - and the action sequences are not much better, until, that is, a spectacular fight scene between Chan and Lee's evil brother, played by Hiroyuki Sanada, set high atop the Eiffel Tower that finally brings the movie to life in its closing stretches.For movie historians, the only real element of note here is the presence of legendary director Roman Polanski as an overzealous French inspector, and acting bulwark Max Von Sydow as World Criminal Court Director Varden Reynard.  As to the latter, what can one say about a career path that starts off with ""The Seventh Seal,"" then passes through something like ""Rush Hour 3"" on the way to its final destination?

I suppose it was just a choice by the studio, but I know that Blu-ray discs can easily hold much more content than just the movie, or just the movie and a commentary track and original theatrical trailer.There are a good many extras available with this release, but those extras aren't on the disc with the movie.  In some ways that could be considered a good thing as you might be tempted to watch the movie again instead of simply putting the extras disc in the player and not having to worry about it.  It just seems a bit strange that the extras do come on another disc rather than having a single disc with movies, extras and everything on it.Further confusion comes from the fact that the main feature itself only runs approximately 90 minutes.  (In many ways that can be considered a good thing about this movie).  At that relatively short length, one would expect there was plenty of left over space on the main disc to have included a lot of the content that was instead put on the second disc.  I suppose the trade off would have been that a bunch of content that is on the second disc might have been left out entirely in the name of saving the plastic used for make the second disc.  If that was truly the case, then in the words of Emily Latela, ""never mind.""Is it worth the purchase?  If you can find it discounted go for it.

1109913,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000WGYMT2,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[0, 0]","Remarkably redundant and yet still entertaining, Brett Ratner's ""Rush Hour 3"" brings back the exhilaratingly hilarious Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker duo. The villains are clich&eacute; and ill-contrived, and the story is a mess of unnecessary subplots and meaningless back-story, but clearly comedy is key. From the first moments of the film to the predictable last, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker demand attention and we willingly comply. The fight sequences are creatively uncommon, and the comedic chemistry between Chan and Tucker never ceases to amuse and amaze. By the time you've seen all three Rush Hour films, you won't be able to decipher the events from one to another, but you'll still be more than satisfied at having watched them.Chief Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) and LAPD Detective Carter (Chris Tucker) are back in the U.S. to avenge Ambassador Han who is nearly assassinated when he attempts to disclose information about the ultra secretive crime syndicate, the Triads. Their investigation brings them to Paris where mysterious nightclub dancer Genevieve (Noemie Lenoir) may be the only clue to uncovering the assassination plot and the marks against their lives. Lee must also come to terms with his longtime friend Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) who may be on the wrong side of the law and at the heart of the conspiracy.Rush Hour 3 wastes no time leaping straight into action and comedy, which perfectly recreates the tone and mood of the first two films. Despite the fact that the story takes a backseat to the action, and the general events that occur are overly repetitious amongst the trilogy, it doesn't attempt to camouflage itself as anything more than meets the eye. Perhaps most disappointing is the predictability of the antagonists and the nearly identical counterpart demises and plot twists.All the principle players return, including a few surprises, such as references to Isabella from Rush Hour 2 and a grown up Soo Yung, and even minor supporting characters such as the police chief. But the spotlight still unquestionably belongs to Tucker and Chan. While Chan is famous for his extraordinary martial arts skills and the fact that he does all of his own stunts, his age is beginning to interfere with the vigor and intensity of the stunts he's willing to attempt. Less spectacular fight sequences are replaced by humorous events choreographed into action - even green-screen work that demonstrates risibly illogical stunts make a disappointing appearance. Chan at least knows how to be creative with his fighting, and in his familiar fashion, makes use of tables, chairs and random props to engage in comical battle. The most impressive stunts are those of the villains who pursue the duo across the streets of Paris in fantastic van and motorcycle chases. It is refreshing to see violence portrayed in such a facetious manner and yet still be equally amusing and precarious. Tucker uses his fast-talking mouth instead of brawn, and while the first two films create a mild distaste for his brand of obnoxiousness, here it is channeled directly toward villains, so the audience can wholeheartedly side with his boisterous blathering.The Rush Hour films have always been a series of action and comedy sequences loosely strung together by plot. It's as if the gags are derived first; the story often feels trite and unoriginal and Rush Hour 3 is no exception. But the chemistry between Tucker and Chan reaches a new high, and the sensational setting of ""The City of Lights"" allows for a whole new slew of racial jokes and political incorrectness. A ""Who's on first?"" routine (obviously inspired by Abbott and Costello), a prim nun translating foul language, and George the anti-American French taxi driver are examples of witty additions to the familiarly mischievous comedy showcased in the series. The inclusion of supermodel Noemie Lenoir is terribly expected, and screen legend Max Von Sydow can't seem to summon life into his predictable role. A showdown on the Eiffel Tower and the amazingly hilarious signature outtakes are other high points, but Kenji's forced villainy and pathetic character development remind us that Rush Hour 3 is a simple film with un-ambitious goals. While nothing is terribly memorable or awe-inspiring, constant bits of crudeness and slapstick humor make the occasion worthwhile even if you can't remember enough funny moments to tell your friends.- Mike Massie",3,Rush Hour 3 Movie Review,1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,4420,"['Remarkably', 'redundant', 'yet', 'still', 'entertaining', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'Rush', '3', 'back', 'exhilaratingly', 'hilarious', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'duo', 'villains', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ill-contrived', 'story', 'mess', 'unnecessary', 'subplots', 'meaningless', 'back-story', 'clearly', 'comedy', 'key', 'first', 'moments', 'film', 'predictable', 'last', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'demand', 'attention', 'willingly', 'comply', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'creatively', 'uncommon', 'comedic', 'chemistry', 'Chan', 'Tucker', 'never', 'amuse', 'amaze', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'three', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'decipher', 'events', 'one', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'more', 'satisfied', 'having', 'watched', 'them.Chief', 'Inspector', 'Lee', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'LAPD', 'Detective', 'Carter', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'are', 'back', 'U.S.', 'avenge', 'Ambassador', 'Han', 'who', 'nearly', 'assassinated', 'when', 'disclose', 'information', 'ultra', 'secretive', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'Triads', 'investigation', 'Paris', 'where', 'mysterious', 'nightclub', 'dancer', 'Genevieve', 'Noemie', 'Lenoir', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'clue', 'uncovering', 'assassination', 'plot', 'marks', 'lives', 'Lee', 'must', 'also', 'come', 'terms', 'longtime', 'friend', 'Kenji', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'side', 'law', 'heart', 'conspiracy.Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'time', 'leaping', 'straight', 'action', 'comedy', 'perfectly', 'tone', 'mood', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'fact', 'story', 'backseat', 'action', 'general', 'events', 'occur', 'are', 'overly', 'repetitious', 'trilogy', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'camouflage', 'anything', 'more', 'eye', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'disappointing', 'predictability', 'antagonists', 'nearly', 'identical', 'counterpart', 'demises', 'plot', 'twists.All', 'principle', 'players', 'return', 'including', 'few', 'surprises', 'such', 'references', 'Isabella', 'Rush', 'Hour', '2', 'grown', 'up', 'Soo', 'Yung', 'even', 'minor', 'supporting', 'characters', 'such', 'police', 'chief', 'spotlight', 'still', 'unquestionably', 'Tucker', 'Chan', 'Chan', 'famous', 'extraordinary', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'fact', 'own', 'stunts', 'age', 'beginning', 'interfere', 'vigor', 'intensity', 'stunts', 'willing', 'attempt', 'Less', 'spectacular', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'replaced', 'humorous', 'events', 'choreographed', 'action', 'even', 'green-screen', 'work', 'risibly', 'illogical', 'stunts', 'make', 'disappointing', 'appearance', 'Chan', 'least', 'knows', 'how', 'be', 'creative', 'fighting', 'familiar', 'fashion', 'use', 'tables', 'chairs', 'random', 'props', 'engage', 'comical', 'battle', 'most', 'impressive', 'stunts', 'are', 'villains', 'who', 'pursue', 'duo', 'streets', 'Paris', 'fantastic', 'van', 'motorcycle', 'chases', 'refreshing', 'see', 'violence', 'portrayed', 'such', 'facetious', 'manner', 'yet', 'still', 'be', 'equally', 'amusing', 'precarious', 'Tucker', 'fast-talking', 'mouth', 'instead', 'brawn', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'create', 'mild', 'distaste', 'brand', 'obnoxiousness', 'here', 'channeled', 'directly', 'villains', 'audience', 'can', 'wholeheartedly', 'side', 'boisterous', 'blathering.The', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'series', 'action', 'comedy', 'sequences', 'loosely', 'strung', 'together', 'plot', 'gags', 'are', 'derived', 'first', 'story', 'often', 'trite', 'unoriginal', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'exception', 'chemistry', 'Tucker', 'Chan', 'new', 'high', 'sensational', 'setting', 'City', 'Lights', 'whole', 'new', 'slew', 'racial', 'jokes', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'Who', 'first', 'routine', 'obviously', 'inspired', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'prim', 'nun', 'translating', 'foul', 'language', 'George', 'anti-American', 'French', 'taxi', 'driver', 'are', 'examples', 'witty', 'additions', 'familiarly', 'mischievous', 'comedy', 'showcased', 'series', 'inclusion', 'supermodel', 'Noemie', 'Lenoir', 'terribly', 'expected', 'screen', 'legend', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'summon', 'life', 'predictable', 'role', 'showdown', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'amazingly', 'hilarious', 'signature', 'outtakes', 'are', 'other', 'high', 'points', 'Kenji', 'forced', 'villainy', 'pathetic', 'character', 'development', 'remind', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'simple', 'film', 'un-ambitious', 'goals', 'nothing', 'terribly', 'memorable', 'awe-inspiring', 'constant', 'bits', 'crudeness', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'make', 'occasion', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'enough', 'funny', 'moments', 'tell', 'friends.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

1109922,A5X1B2HBQUR3P,B000WGYMT2,"Vikram Ramanathan ""Live to Learn""","[1, 1]","You get more of the same. Chris tucker and Jackie chan jumping of bridges and buildings, chasing cars, parachuting curtains (yes you heard me right), jumping of Eiffel tower with a curtain as parachute...err...yeah. Not joking. The same crazy slapstick action comedy with Chan's brand of fighting and Chris tuckrts wise cracks and comic style. There is some story of the Hong Kong triads in Paris thrown in to make a ""rush hour 3"" (Why the hell are there chineese people in Paris ?) Some lousy story I did not even bother to follow the story line. I was there just to see the Jackie and Chris chemistry but I was surprised that I was so jaded with the stuff that I have seen twice already. All unreal stuff. Neither Chris or Jackie get bruised or wounded. They gleefully miss bullets, they bounce of 2 story jumps with just a scraped knee. No broken ribs. No broken bones. Lethal weapon gave some realism to violence in that Mel and Danny suffer bruises. They feel some pain. But this movie feels more like a cartoon but then again the movie is a continuation of the successful franchise set in motion with the first rush hour but with this movie it has exploited the last ounce of the ""rush hour"" barrel. It was like seeing the part 1 and part 2 again. Back then rush hour 1 was new and had an innovative feel to it but 2 and 3 got me so bored as after rush hour 1 we knew the tricks and gags that we could expect so it was just a question of Chris and jackie doing their big jumps, char chases, bickering and  Chris tucker's moon walk and michael jackson or prince like singing/dance impression. What prompted me to watch the movie also was that it is directed by Brett Ratner who did Xmen3 and I loved his vision and style of Xmen3 so I wanted to see what he did with Rush Hour 3 but RH franchise is so used up that even Brett could not instill any new life into an already dead doll.regards, Vikram",3,Hello movie producers - Please dont bring out Rush Hour 4.0,1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,1902,"['get', 'more', 'same', 'Chris', 'tucker', 'Jackie', 'chan', 'jumping', 'bridges', 'buildings', 'chasing', 'cars', 'parachuting', 'curtains', 'yes', 'heard', 'right', 'jumping', 'Eiffel', 'tower', 'curtain', 'parachute', 'err', 'yeah', 'Not', 'joking', 'same', 'crazy', 'slapstick', 'action', 'comedy', 'Chan', 'brand', 'fighting', 'Chris', 'tuckrts', 'wise', 'cracks', 'comic', 'style', 'story', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'triads', 'Paris', 'thrown', 'make', 'rush', 'hour', '3', 'Why', 'hell', 'are', 'there', 'chineese', 'people', 'Paris', 'lousy', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'bother', 'follow', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'there', 'just', 'see', 'Jackie', 'Chris', 'chemistry', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'so', 'jaded', 'stuff', 'have', 'seen', 'twice', 'already', 'unreal', 'stuff', 'Chris', 'Jackie', 'get', 'bruised', 'wounded', 'gleefully', 'miss', 'bullets', 'bounce', '2', 'story', 'jumps', 'just', 'scraped', 'knee', 'broken', 'ribs', 'broken', 'bones', 'Lethal', 'weapon', 'gave', 'realism', 'violence', 'Mel', 'Danny', 'suffer', 'bruises', 'feel', 'pain', 'movie', 'more', 'cartoon', 'then', 'again', 'movie', 'continuation', 'successful', 'franchise', 'set', 'motion', 'first', 'rush', 'hour', 'movie', 'exploited', 'last', 'ounce', 'rush', 'hour', 'barrel', 'was', 'seeing', 'part', '1', 'part', '2', 'again', 'Back', 'then', 'rush', 'hour', '1', 'was', 'new', 'had', 'innovative', 'feel', '2', '3', 'got', 'so', 'bored', 'rush', 'hour', '1', 'knew', 'tricks', 'gags', 'could', 'expect', 'was', 'just', 'question', 'Chris', 'jackie', 'doing', 'big', 'jumps', 'char', 'chases', 'bickering', 'Chris', 'tucker', 'moon', 'walk', 'michael', 'jackson', 'prince', 'singing/dance', 'impression', 'What', 'prompted', 'watch', 'movie', 'also', 'was', 'directed', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'who', 'did', 'Xmen3', 'loved', 'vision', 'style', 'Xmen3', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'did', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'RH', 'franchise', 'so', 'used', 'up', 'even', 'Brett', 'could', 'not', 'instill', 'new', 'life', 'already', 'dead', 'doll.regards', 'Vikram']",N/A
