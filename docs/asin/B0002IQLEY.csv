I checked out several Goosebumps VHS at my local library several years ago, in which one of them was Welcome to Dead House. Yes, it has a low-budget and bad acting, but I still liked it for some odd reason. I later found the VHS at a local thrift store. I later found out that the episode was released on DVD back in 2004. Luckly, a few years ago, I found the DVD thrown into the five dollar bin at Walmart!Welcome to Dead House is a great addiction to my Goosebumps Collection.",5,One of My Favorite Goosebumps!,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,592,"['grew', 'up', 'reading', 'books', 'only', 'saw', 'handful', 'episodes', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'middle', '1990s', 'checked', 'out', 'several', 'Goosebumps', 'VHS', 'local', 'library', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'one', 'was', 'Welcome', 'Dead', 'House', 'Yes', 'low-budget', 'bad', 'acting', 'still', 'liked', 'odd', 'reason', 'later', 'found', 'VHS', 'local', 'thrift', 'store', 'later', 'found', 'out', 'episode', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'back', '2004', 'Luckly', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'found', 'DVD', 'thrown', 'five', 'dollar', 'bin', 'Walmart', 'Welcome', 'Dead', 'House', 'great', 'addiction', 'Goosebumps', 'Collection']",N/A

The acting was terrible. I think it was a PG show, had it been TV-14 it could have been much better.I expected this to be exactly like the book, but it wasnt. Even the ending was different. The ending in the book was good, the final few chapters were great but in the show they rushed through the ending. Thats what stinks about this whole idea. had ot been a straight to dvd movie, it could have been better and they could have had more time. TV only gives you some 20 minutes for a half hour show and that is not nearly enough time to really bring the book to life.",2,Better in print,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,695,"['book', 'got', 'hooked', 'back', 'reading', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'movie', 'version', 'Well', 'more', 'TV', 'version', 'acting', 'was', 'terrible', 'think', 'was', 'PG', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'TV-14', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better.I', 'expected', 'be', 'exactly', 'book', 'Even', 'ending', 'was', 'different', 'ending', 'book', 'was', 'good', 'final', 'few', 'chapters', 'were', 'great', 'show', 'rushed', 'ending', 'Thats', 'what', 'whole', 'idea', 'had', 'ot', 'been', 'straight', 'dvd', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'TV', 'only', '20', 'minutes', 'half', 'hour', 'show', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'time', 'really', 'bring', 'book', 'life']",N/A

836260,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0002IQLEY,Tim Janson,"[12, 13]","Welcome to Dead House is a pretty good family horror edition of Goose Bumps with some genuine, but not too intense scares for young one.  A family of four moves into an old house in a town called Dark Falls.  The name Dark Falls is appropriate as it always seems to be dark in the town.  Even when the sun is out, the large, overgrown trees seem to always block it out.  Josh and Amanda are the two kids that immediately have bad feelings about the town.  They meet up with some other kids in town who act very strange and are very pale.Of course the parents are typical, unbelieving parents who dismiss the kid's as just having bad dreams or the like.  But the whole family will soon learn the tragic secret of Dead falls and of the hazardous chemical accident that forever changed the town years before.  The film moves pretty well and provides a true sense of creepiness about the town and the new house the family is in.  It's one you can watch with the whole family.",4,A GOOD FAMILY HORROR,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,971,"['Welcome', 'Dead', 'House', 'pretty', 'good', 'family', 'horror', 'edition', 'Goose', 'Bumps', 'genuine', 'not', 'too', 'intense', 'scares', 'young', 'one', 'family', 'four', 'moves', 'old', 'house', 'town', 'called', 'Dark', 'Falls', 'name', 'Dark', 'Falls', 'appropriate', 'always', 'be', 'dark', 'town', 'Even', 'when', 'sun', 'out', 'large', 'overgrown', 'trees', 'seem', 'always', 'block', 'out', 'Josh', 'Amanda', 'are', 'two', 'kids', 'immediately', 'have', 'bad', 'feelings', 'town', 'meet', 'up', 'other', 'kids', 'town', 'who', 'act', 'very', 'strange', 'are', 'very', 'pale.Of', 'course', 'parents', 'are', 'typical', 'unbelieving', 'parents', 'who', 'dismiss', 'kid', 'just', 'having', 'bad', 'dreams', 'like', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'soon', 'learn', 'tragic', 'secret', 'Dead', 'falls', 'hazardous', 'chemical', 'accident', 'forever', 'changed', 'town', 'years', 'film', 'moves', 'pretty', 'well', 'true', 'sense', 'creepiness', 'town', 'new', 'house', 'family', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'whole', 'family']",N/A
836261,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0002IQLEY,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 2]","In the early 1990s, R.L. Stine's ""Goosebumps"" books were a huge publishing phenomena especially with elementary and middle school students.  The books were so popular that a television series based upon the books was developed.  Taking a cue from shows such as THE TWILIGHT ZONE and TALES FROM THE CRYPT, each episode was preceded and concluded with an introduction from R.L. Stine himself usually ending with a twist on the tag-line for the books that ""viewers beware, you're in for a scare"".WELCOME TO DEAD HOUSE originally aired as a two-part episode during Goosebumps 2nd season in 1996-97.  The episode has now been combined and is featured here on this DVD.  Even though this episode came late in the 2nd season, it's based upon the first Goosebumps book ever. After the recent unemployment of their father, the Benson family moves to the town of Dark Falls, a place where the sun rarely shines.  Before anyone even enters their new house, daughter Amanda sees some strange things in the house and gets a creepy vibe.  Strange events start to happen.  At times it seems like there's something or someone trying to get in the house, but then it seems there's something trying to warn Amanda to get her family away.WELCOME TO DEAD HOUSE does a pretty good job of following the book on which it is based, with one major exception.  There are some images that younger viewers might find frightening, but other than that the DVD is pretty safe and is something that family's might enjoy watching together for a few chills and thrills.",4,Watch Out For Ghosts Or Other Things That Go Bump In the Night,1239062400,"04 7, 2009",2009,1535,"['early', '1990s', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'Goosebumps', 'books', 'were', 'huge', 'publishing', 'phenomena', 'especially', 'elementary', 'middle', 'school', 'students', 'books', 'were', 'so', 'popular', 'television', 'series', 'based', 'books', 'was', 'developed', 'Taking', 'cue', 'shows', 'such', 'THE', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'TALES', 'FROM', 'THE', 'CRYPT', 'episode', 'was', 'preceded', 'concluded', 'introduction', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'usually', 'ending', 'twist', 'tag-line', 'books', 'viewers', 'beware', ""'re"", 'scare', '.WELCOME', 'TO', 'DEAD', 'HOUSE', 'originally', 'aired', 'two-part', 'episode', 'Goosebumps', '2nd', 'season', '1996-97', 'episode', 'now', 'been', 'combined', 'featured', 'here', 'DVD', 'Even', 'episode', 'came', 'late', '2nd', 'season', 'based', 'first', 'Goosebumps', 'book', 'ever', 'recent', 'unemployment', 'father', 'Benson', 'family', 'moves', 'town', 'Dark', 'Falls', 'place', 'where', 'sun', 'rarely', 'shines', 'anyone', 'even', 'new', 'house', 'daughter', 'Amanda', 'strange', 'things', 'house', 'creepy', 'vibe', 'Strange', 'events', 'start', 'happen', 'times', 'something', 'someone', 'trying', 'get', 'house', 'then', 'something', 'trying', 'warn', 'Amanda', 'get', 'family', 'away.WELCOME', 'TO', 'DEAD', 'HOUSE', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'following', 'book', 'based', 'one', 'major', 'exception', 'are', 'images', 'younger', 'viewers', 'might', 'find', 'frightening', 'other', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'safe', 'something', 'family', 'might', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'together', 'few', 'chills', 'thrills']",N/A
