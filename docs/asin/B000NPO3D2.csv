1059515,A1D22OU25XABAK,B000NPO3D2,Baranabus,"[5, 8]","Apparently the Germans have a word that literally means ""Grandfather + fear + WWII"", meaning the fear they feel when they wonder what their relatives did during the Holocaust. War Criminal Amon Goeth's daughter Monika, who slowly learned of her legacy as an adolescent, seems to vacillate between resigned acceptance of a horrible truth and occasional lapses of childlike naivete. In one strange scene at the Villa where her father imprisoned Helen, the survivor she later meets, Monika seems to go back into the bubble of denial that she must've been raised in as she surprisingly tells Helen of some rationalization for why her father killed only 'certain' people - some contamination theory (?) - which only sounds just as antisemitic anyway so it doesn't really make sense. Helen has to snap her out of this denial and make her face the ugly reality that she still seems to struggle with.We also see the irreversible damage done when Helen talks about her husband. That scene was possibly the most heartbreaking, as she lost her father, her teenage boyfriend, and ultimately her husband to the Nazis. Others have asked whether she can forgive or not, which to me seems like an almost insulting question. It reminds me of how Sister Mary Prejean later regretted asking the parents of a raped and murdered woman if they could forgive the killer- the audacity of that just enrages me. Why do people think there is going to be some kind of nice happy ending to a tragic event? Why do they expect some kind of 'group hug' type of moment?!! Yes, there are some people who do forgive (often for spiritual reasons) but to expect it of people is kind of galling, I think. People are entitled to their anger, after all, in these circumstances, they are usually left with little else to soldier on with.A couple of interesting things that I wondered about that are unexplored tangents-- since these legacies can affect generations, it's interesting that Helen's daughter appears well-adjusted, yet Monika's daughter is an addict unable to care for her baby. Helen seems quite strong, albeit scarred- understandably- but quite resilient. Yet Monika seems rather fragile and at times childlike. As Helen said, she had to grow up at 14 and learn to survive- yet one gets the sense that Monika was probably more withdrawn into a fantasy world of how things were, and perhaps was even encouraged to do so by her mother and others to deny reality. At times, she appears to be slowly coming out of that fantasy world. Given the real one, I can understand why she'd want to live in that world.A couple of strange things about the Villa at the camp- I wondered if it was actually occupied- at first it appears abandoned, but as they make their way into the kitchen, it appears inhabited. I hope it's just a historically preserved site and not a residence, because that would be really disturbing. Also, the photos are unnerving as one minute we see Goeth on the porch with a rifle (Helen said he would often shoot people in the mornings, first thing, as if he couldn't wait to start killing people), then you see Monika's mother Ruth sunning herself, smiling, or other folks lounging, relaxed and content. That coexistence of psychopathy and everyday non-chalance is so chilling and strange. As if it was all the same as plowing the fields or fishing...this was always one of the mysteries of this kind of phenomenon. How mass murder could be so casually dealt with. Which also brings up the issue of Monika and her mother; Helen says, and  I think accurately so, that Monika seems to have decided and/or accepted that her father was a monster but can't forgive her mother for loving him anyway and sitting by while it all happened. Also, since she knew her mother, she could see her as a human being, but her father could remain an abstract representation of evil, not a parent that she was bonded to (he was executed).This was a very moving film and reminded me how much closer these memories are than I realize; since I was born in 65 this era seems like another world to me, and I'm not related to any survivors, so it can feel remote to me. One of the saddest parts is learning about Helen's husband who never recovered from his memories and took his own life. That seems so unfair that he should escape physically yet be forever trapped emotionally and psychologically.",5,Painful Legacies,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,4359,"['Apparently', 'Germans', 'have', 'word', 'literally', 'Grandfather', '+', 'fear', '+', 'WWII', 'meaning', 'fear', 'feel', 'when', 'wonder', 'what', 'relatives', 'did', 'Holocaust', 'War', 'Criminal', 'Amon', 'Goeth', 'daughter', 'Monika', 'who', 'slowly', 'learned', 'legacy', 'adolescent', 'vacillate', 'resigned', 'acceptance', 'horrible', 'truth', 'occasional', 'lapses', 'childlike', 'naivete', 'one', 'strange', 'scene', 'Villa', 'where', 'father', 'imprisoned', 'Helen', 'survivor', 'later', 'meets', 'Monika', 'go', 'back', 'bubble', 'denial', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'raised', 'surprisingly', 'Helen', 'rationalization', 'why', 'father', 'killed', 'only', ""'certain"", 'people', 'contamination', 'theory', 'only', 'just', 'antisemitic', 'anyway', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'Helen', 'snap', 'denial', 'make', 'face', 'ugly', 'reality', 'still', 'struggle', 'with.We', 'also', 'see', 'irreversible', 'damage', 'done', 'when', 'Helen', 'talks', 'husband', 'scene', 'was', 'possibly', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'lost', 'father', 'teenage', 'boyfriend', 'ultimately', 'husband', 'Nazis', 'Others', 'have', 'asked', 'can', 'forgive', 'not', 'almost', 'insulting', 'question', 'how', 'Sister', 'Mary', 'Prejean', 'later', 'regretted', 'asking', 'parents', 'raped', 'murdered', 'woman', 'could', 'forgive', 'killer-', 'audacity', 'just', 'Why', 'do', 'people', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'kind', 'nice', 'happy', 'ending', 'tragic', 'event', 'Why', 'do', 'expect', 'kind', ""'group"", 'hug', 'type', 'moment', 'Yes', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'forgive', 'often', 'spiritual', 'reasons', 'expect', 'people', 'kind', 'galling', 'think', 'People', 'are', 'entitled', 'anger', 'circumstances', 'are', 'usually', 'left', 'little', 'else', 'soldier', 'with.A', 'couple', 'interesting', 'things', 'wondered', 'are', 'unexplored', 'tangents', 'legacies', 'can', 'affect', 'generations', 'interesting', 'Helen', 'daughter', 'well-adjusted', 'yet', 'Monika', 'daughter', 'addict', 'unable', 'care', 'baby', 'Helen', 'quite', 'strong', 'scarred-', 'understandably-', 'quite', 'resilient', 'Monika', 'rather', 'fragile', 'times', 'childlike', 'Helen', 'said', 'had', 'grow', 'up', '14', 'learn', 'survive-', 'yet', 'one', 'sense', 'Monika', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'withdrawn', 'fantasy', 'world', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'perhaps', 'was', 'even', 'encouraged', 'do', 'so', 'mother', 'others', 'deny', 'reality', 'times', 'be', 'slowly', 'coming', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Given', 'real', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'why', ""'d"", 'want', 'live', 'world.A', 'couple', 'strange', 'things', 'Villa', 'camp-', 'wondered', 'was', 'actually', 'occupied-', 'first', 'abandoned', 'make', 'way', 'kitchen', 'inhabited', 'hope', 'just', 'historically', 'preserved', 'site', 'not', 'residence', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'disturbing', 'Also', 'photos', 'are', 'unnerving', 'one', 'minute', 'see', 'Goeth', 'porch', 'rifle', 'Helen', 'said', 'would', 'often', 'shoot', 'people', 'mornings', 'first', 'thing', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'start', 'killing', 'people', 'then', 'see', 'Monika', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'sunning', 'smiling', 'other', 'folks', 'lounging', 'relaxed', 'content', 'coexistence', 'psychopathy', 'everyday', 'non-chalance', 'so', 'chilling', 'strange', 'was', 'same', 'plowing', 'fields', 'fishing', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'mysteries', 'kind', 'phenomenon', 'How', 'mass', 'murder', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'casually', 'dealt', 'Which', 'also', 'up', 'issue', 'Monika', 'mother', 'Helen', 'think', 'accurately', 'so', 'Monika', 'have', 'decided', 'and/or', 'accepted', 'father', 'was', 'monster', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'mother', 'loving', 'anyway', 'sitting', 'happened', 'Also', 'knew', 'mother', 'could', 'see', 'human', 'being', 'father', 'could', 'remain', 'abstract', 'representation', 'evil', 'not', 'parent', 'was', 'bonded', 'was', 'executed', '.This', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'reminded', 'how', 'much', 'closer', 'memories', 'are', 'realize', 'was', 'born', '65', 'era', 'world', ""'m"", 'not', 'related', 'survivors', 'can', 'feel', 'remote', 'One', 'saddest', 'parts', 'learning', 'Helen', 'husband', 'who', 'never', 'recovered', 'memories', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'so', 'unfair', 'should', 'escape', 'physically', 'yet', 'be', 'forever', 'trapped', 'emotionally', 'psychologically']",Inheritance

1059522,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B000NPO3D2,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[5, 7]","Monika Hertwig is the reason to see ""Inheritance."" She comes across as a very real, lovely woman, someone you'd like to have as a friend or next door neighbor. She's a grandmother and housewife, in her sixties, very tall and slim. She's sensitive and caring. She's also the daughter of Amon Goeth, the commandant of Plaszow, the Nazi concentration camp depicted in ""Schindler's List."" In that film, Ralph Fiennes played Monika's father. Monika was born in 1945. Goeth was executed in 1946.Monika reports how she learned, slowly but surely, as a child, who her father was and what he did. Monika contacted Helen Jonas, who, as a child, had been one of two Jewish woman named Helen who had served as Goeth's slaves in his Plaszow home. Jonas lived in New Jersey. Monika and Helen met at the site of the Plaszow concentration camp, and James Moll filmed their meeting.As several viewers have noted, Monika comes across as the more sympathetic of the two women. Monika allows her emotions to show. She weeps profusely when meeting Helen and appears to be approaching Helen for a hug. Helen rebuffs her. It is clear that Helen was severely hurt by her childhood experiences, and has never fully recovered. She still views the world as hostile, even when it is not. Monika is not an enemy. It is her profound misfortune to be the biological child of a very evil man, but she herself is not evil. One would have liked to have seen Helen express the forgiveness for which Monika so obviously hungers.Monika never knew her father, and comes to know him from others' accounts, including Spielberg's and Fiennes' depiction of Goeth in ""Schindler's List."" Helen fleshes out the depiction. Goeth pushed Helen, a mere child, down the stairs in his home several times. He knew that Helen, his little slave, had a boyfriend, Adam. One day Goeth teasingly asked Helen where Adam was, and, then, within minutes, shot Adam. Goeth kept two large dogs at Plaszow. He trained them to maul and kill human victims. He robbed Jews before killing them. Monika has a cigarette case from her father. She suspected that he stole it from one of his Jewish victims.Most mysterious is Monika's mother, Ruth Kalder. No one in the documentary mentions it, but, weirdly, Ruth looks Jewish; certainly her features are those that Nazis would identify as Jewish. She had abundant, striking black hair and a prominent nose, which Monika inherited. In one photo, Ruth looks very much like Chico Marx. This is not a wisecrack, but a statement of fact. It's more than a little odd that Goeth would select a girl who looked so Jewish, even as he sent thousands of Jews to their deaths for their allegedly obvious ""racial inferiority,"" a racial inferiority that was supposed to be obvious in their dark Semitic features, allegedly so different from blond Aryan superiority. One has to ask, why did Ruth love Goeth? The documentary does not probe this pressing question.""Inheritance"" includes archival film footage of the actual execution, by hanging, of Amon Goeth. It was a grotesque event. Hangmen need to know their physics. Length of rope and drop must be calculated to produce a clean death. The masked executioners in Poland tried to kill Goeth two times before getting it right on the third try. The viewer may question why it is important to view this spectacle of death.I would like to have seen some harder questions asked of each character. Monika: Point blank, did you inherit any of your father's evil? Where did that evil come from? Where did it go? Is he in hell? Can God ever forgive men like Amon Goeth? What would you do if you were God? Would you send your father to hell forever? If not, why not?Helen: Will you ever be able to forgive? Will you ever be able to move on? Will you always be stuck in victim mode? Why are you so harsh with Monika?What about Helen's children? I would have liked to have heard more about their experience of being children of survivors. I would have liked to have seen some depth given to Poland. The bulk of this film was shot in Poland. There were Germans and Jews but there were Polish victims and heroes and perpetrators as well. Poland isn't even background in this doc and that is a failing. Two suicides and one drug addiction are mentioned, but not explored. In short, I was very moved by this documentary, but I would like to have seen it go deeper into the very big questions it touches on.",4,Profoundly Moving and Unique,1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,4406,"['Monika', 'Hertwig', 'reason', 'see', 'Inheritance', 'across', 'very', 'real', 'lovely', 'woman', 'someone', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'friend', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'grandmother', 'housewife', 'sixties', 'very', 'tall', 'slim', 'sensitive', 'caring', 'also', 'daughter', 'Amon', 'Goeth', 'commandant', 'Plaszow', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camp', 'depicted', 'Schindler', 'List', 'film', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'played', 'Monika', 'father', 'Monika', 'was', 'born', '1945', 'Goeth', 'was', 'executed', '1946.Monika', 'reports', 'how', 'learned', 'slowly', 'surely', 'child', 'who', 'father', 'was', 'what', 'did', 'Monika', 'contacted', 'Helen', 'Jonas', 'who', 'child', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'two', 'Jewish', 'woman', 'named', 'Helen', 'who', 'had', 'served', 'Goeth', 'slaves', 'Plaszow', 'home', 'Jonas', 'lived', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Monika', 'Helen', 'met', 'site', 'Plaszow', 'concentration', 'camp', 'James', 'Moll', 'filmed', 'meeting.As', 'several', 'viewers', 'have', 'noted', 'Monika', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'two', 'women', 'Monika', 'emotions', 'show', 'profusely', 'when', 'meeting', 'Helen', 'be', 'approaching', 'Helen', 'hug', 'Helen', 'clear', 'Helen', 'was', 'severely', 'hurt', 'childhood', 'experiences', 'never', 'fully', 'recovered', 'still', 'world', 'hostile', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'Monika', 'not', 'enemy', 'profound', 'misfortune', 'be', 'biological', 'child', 'very', 'evil', 'man', 'not', 'evil', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Helen', 'forgiveness', 'Monika', 'so', 'obviously', 'hungers.Monika', 'never', 'knew', 'father', 'know', 'others', 'accounts', 'including', 'Spielberg', 'Fiennes', 'depiction', 'Goeth', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Helen', 'out', 'depiction', 'Goeth', 'pushed', 'Helen', 'mere', 'child', 'down', 'stairs', 'home', 'several', 'times', 'knew', 'Helen', 'little', 'slave', 'had', 'boyfriend', 'Adam', 'One', 'day', 'Goeth', 'teasingly', 'asked', 'Helen', 'where', 'Adam', 'was', 'then', 'minutes', 'shot', 'Adam', 'Goeth', 'kept', 'two', 'large', 'dogs', 'Plaszow', 'trained', 'maul', 'kill', 'human', 'victims', 'robbed', 'Jews', 'killing', 'Monika', 'cigarette', 'case', 'father', 'suspected', 'stole', 'one', 'Jewish', 'victims.Most', 'mysterious', 'Monika', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'Kalder', 'one', 'documentary', 'mentions', 'weirdly', 'Ruth', 'Jewish', 'certainly', 'features', 'are', 'Nazis', 'would', 'identify', 'Jewish', 'had', 'abundant', 'striking', 'black', 'hair', 'prominent', 'nose', 'Monika', 'inherited', 'one', 'photo', 'Ruth', 'very', 'much', 'Chico', 'Marx', 'not', 'wisecrack', 'statement', 'fact', 'more', 'little', 'odd', 'Goeth', 'would', 'select', 'girl', 'who', 'looked', 'so', 'Jewish', 'even', 'sent', 'thousands', 'Jews', 'deaths', 'allegedly', 'obvious', 'racial', 'inferiority', 'racial', 'inferiority', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'obvious', 'dark', 'Semitic', 'features', 'allegedly', 'so', 'different', 'blond', 'Aryan', 'superiority', 'One', 'ask', 'why', 'did', 'Ruth', 'love', 'Goeth', 'documentary', 'not', 'probe', 'pressing', 'question', 'Inheritance', 'archival', 'film', 'footage', 'actual', 'execution', 'hanging', 'Amon', 'Goeth', 'was', 'grotesque', 'event', 'Hangmen', 'need', 'know', 'physics', 'Length', 'rope', 'drop', 'must', 'be', 'calculated', 'produce', 'clean', 'death', 'masked', 'executioners', 'Poland', 'tried', 'kill', 'Goeth', 'two', 'times', 'getting', 'right', 'third', 'try', 'viewer', 'may', 'question', 'why', 'important', 'view', 'spectacle', 'death.I', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'harder', 'questions', 'asked', 'character', 'Monika', 'Point', 'blank', 'did', 'inherit', 'father', 'evil', 'Where', 'did', 'evil', 'come', 'Where', 'did', 'go', 'hell', 'Can', 'God', 'ever', 'forgive', 'men', 'Amon', 'Goeth', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'God', 'Would', 'send', 'father', 'hell', 'forever', 'not', 'why', 'not', 'Helen', 'Will', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'forgive', 'Will', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'move', 'Will', 'always', 'be', 'stuck', 'victim', 'mode', 'Why', 'are', 'harsh', 'Monika', 'What', 'Helen', 'children', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'heard', 'more', 'experience', 'being', 'children', 'survivors', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'depth', 'given', 'Poland', 'bulk', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Poland', 'were', 'Germans', 'Jews', 'were', 'Polish', 'victims', 'heroes', 'perpetrators', 'as', 'well', 'Poland', ""n't"", 'even', 'background', 'doc', 'failing', 'Two', 'suicides', 'one', 'drug', 'addiction', 'are', 'mentioned', 'not', 'explored', 'short', 'was', 'very', 'moved', 'documentary', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'go', 'deeper', 'very', 'big', 'questions']",Inheritance

This film should be shown to psych students as a hideous example of transference/countertransference and projection. Indeed, some of the responses to this post are great examples of same. My post seems to have pushed a lot of buttons, but I learned long ago to get out of the way of the crossfire between a person and him-/herself, so I'm stepping aside and letting my detractors illustrate exactly what I'm saying better than I ever could.Susanna was looking for someone to take blame, and she found it in Monika, who was looking for someone to blame her. A match made in heaven. Susanna has the whole world empathizing, sympathizing. Was it horrific? Of course. It was worse than unspeakable. But she has a form of comfort in her victimhood that Monika does not have. And Monika is a victim, too, because--and I can't overstate this--she didn't do anything. She doesn't need forgiveness. She was not a perpetrator. And despite everyone's insistence to the contrary, she is being treated like one, but she opened the door to this by offering herself up as a sacrificial lamb to Susanna, who got to spit, if not on THE perpetrator, on someone who looked just like him. In the scene where Susanna tears her a new one for saying what she had been told as a child, I did not see someone who actually believed it. I saw a person offering up the only, albeit feeble, explanation for her denial. I saw someone who was regressing to the person she was when she was told that stuff--a child--and was simply offering up an explanation as to why she had taken a lifetime to come to terms with the horror her father was. And she was coming to terms with it, as evidenced by her presence at the monument and in Susanna's company. But her psyche had protected her by giving her that ridiculous explanation. I think that she unfortunately came away with the undeserved blame she was seeking and went away full of ammunition with which to persecute herself for the rest of her days for something she DID NOT DO. A whole lot of reviewers of this movie say they understand that Monika was not the perpetrator, but underneath it all, on a deep level, everyone is treating her that way.

One woman, Helen Jonas, was a young girl in the Plaszow Concentration Camp, and the other woman is the daughter of the late Amon Goeth, who was the inhumane monster that ran the camp.It is two totally different stories about survival.  Helen Jonas is actually a real life character in Schindler's List that was saved from certain death by basically being held as a domestic slave by Amon Goeth.Monika Hertwig is the daughter, who through no fault of her own has paid for &#34;the sins of the father&#34; for over sixty years.  She was only three years old and not living at Krakow when all of the horrors were transpiring.This is the story of these two amazingly strong women and their struggles with their pasts, and their victories of living.Monika Hertwig never knew much about her father until 1993 when Schindler's List was released.  That movie was what opened her eyes to the history she was innocently part of and desperately wanted to know that she was in no way like her father.  As I watched her and listened to her speak, I saw a woman who was broken down by a past that she in no way had contributed to, except by being the recipient of a gene pool that she would have preferred never to been a part.Helen Jonas suffered the consequences of being a young Jewish girl in a horrendous time in our history.  She lived through this physically, but now when she is I believe in her 70's still has and will always have the physical and mental scars that will remain with her throughout her life.Monika reached out to Helen and wanted to meet her to get a better understanding of the true facts of the time, a true accounting of her father's brutality, and I believe wanted assurances that she was nothing like her father.I know their are other documentaries on the children of the brutal Nazi monsters that I have yet to watch, but I have read extensively about these children and many of them as adults were voluntarily sterilized so that their gene pool would end, and there would be no chance of them passing on any of the traits of their parents.I found myself with tears running down my face several times during this documentary because my heart broke for both women and for what each had suffered from the events of that time in history, and both were truly innocent victims of this atrocity.The women eventually met at the site of the concentration camp and were able to talk with each other about the events of each of their lives.I am glad I watched this, but it did leave me with very sad and empty feeling when it was over.  I think most people look only at the history and lives of the Jewish survivors.  This documentary delves into the other side of the coin, so to speak, and forces us to remember the innocents that have been caught up in this horror by no fault of their own.",5,Heartbreaking.,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,2861,"['documentary', 'two', 'survivors', 'Holocaust', 'One', 'woman', 'Helen', 'Jonas', 'was', 'young', 'girl', 'Plaszow', 'Concentration', 'Camp', 'other', 'woman', 'daughter', 'late', 'Amon', 'Goeth', 'who', 'was', 'inhumane', 'monster', 'ran', 'camp.It', 'two', 'totally', 'different', 'stories', 'survival', 'Helen', 'Jonas', 'actually', 'real', 'life', 'character', 'Schindler', 'List', 'was', 'saved', 'certain', 'death', 'basically', 'being', 'held', 'domestic', 'slave', 'Amon', 'Goeth.Monika', 'Hertwig', 'daughter', 'who', 'fault', 'own', 'paid', '34', 'sins', 'father', '34', 'sixty', 'years', 'was', 'only', 'three', 'years', 'old', 'not', 'living', 'Krakow', 'when', 'horrors', 'were', 'story', 'two', 'amazingly', 'strong', 'women', 'struggles', 'pasts', 'victories', 'living.Monika', 'Hertwig', 'never', 'knew', 'much', 'father', '1993', 'when', 'Schindler', 'List', 'was', 'released', 'movie', 'was', 'what', 'opened', 'eyes', 'history', 'was', 'innocently', 'part', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'know', 'was', 'way', 'father', 'watched', 'listened', 'speak', 'saw', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'broken', 'down', 'past', 'way', 'had', 'contributed', 'being', 'recipient', 'gene', 'pool', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'never', 'been', 'part.Helen', 'Jonas', 'suffered', 'consequences', 'being', 'young', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'horrendous', 'time', 'history', 'lived', 'physically', 'now', 'when', 'believe', '70', 'still', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'physical', 'mental', 'scars', 'will', 'remain', 'life.Monika', 'reached', 'out', 'Helen', 'wanted', 'meet', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'true', 'facts', 'time', 'true', 'accounting', 'father', 'brutality', 'believe', 'wanted', 'assurances', 'was', 'nothing', 'father.I', 'know', 'are', 'other', 'documentaries', 'children', 'brutal', 'Nazi', 'monsters', 'have', 'yet', 'watch', 'have', 'read', 'extensively', 'children', 'many', 'adults', 'were', 'voluntarily', 'sterilized', 'so', 'gene', 'pool', 'would', 'end', 'would', 'be', 'chance', 'passing', 'traits', 'parents.I', 'found', 'tears', 'running', 'down', 'face', 'several', 'times', 'documentary', 'heart', 'broke', 'women', 'what', 'had', 'suffered', 'events', 'time', 'history', 'were', 'truly', 'innocent', 'victims', 'atrocity.The', 'women', 'eventually', 'met', 'site', 'concentration', 'camp', 'were', 'able', 'talk', 'other', 'events', 'lives.I', 'am', 'glad', 'watched', 'did', 'leave', 'very', 'sad', 'empty', 'feeling', 'when', 'was', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'look', 'only', 'history', 'lives', 'Jewish', 'survivors', 'documentary', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'so', 'speak', 'forces', 'remember', 'innocents', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'up', 'horror', 'fault', 'own']",Inheritance

1059527,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,B000NPO3D2,.fgd,"[2, 5]","The longer the film went on, the more disconcerting  and uncomfortable it was to see how bright with malice Helen was. It wasn't just because old wounds were opened up for the film and the meeting with Monika; photos of her as a young woman with her husband bear traces of it too. How could her husband let time heal around her? Other Jews not so ""fortunate"" to be valued as a house-maid were beaten down in spirit. Rather than fight and spite, mostly people allow deep time to dissassociate from trauma into a gentler reconciliation. It's possible if far from complete.  The dead are not in hell because they were innocent like Helen rants to Monika beside their graves. Such cruelty has been going on for centuries,moreover it's still not over.Maybe a thousand years from today such barbarism  as genocideS  will be sniffed at like we regard medaevil instruments of torture but it will take  intellect not emotion. So I can't say I was swept away by her.Meanwhile Monika is as shaken as a rape victim suffering from the common delusion about rape that it is her fault. The main point,which the film did not explore, was that the shakiness is to do with her mother. I don't think even Monika has taken the bull by the horns on that one. The uncertainty in that relationship was perpetuated in Monika's own relationship with her daughter, who became a drug addict and too much of a bad mother to care for Monika's grandson.Monika's Nazi father was is not tangible nough to leave Monika looking so haggard and masochistic at the reunion. She had not know him or enough about him that she would be infected by such raw emotions. But there is a hidden twisted story , untellable in this film, which Monika had tried to piece together from her mother in terms of her mother's accountability . It debilitates her because there is no accountability. Apparently.... Thankfully Monika never fully identifies with her as a true mother and Ruth,mysteriously, as Monika her daughter. And what kind of b####ch would accuse her of being just like her father.?Her suicide could have been effortless with the right pill. Helen vividly associates her with face-masks. She killed herself around the same time her looks were fading as though there could be no denying the rot inside. In keeping with her vanity, the public consensus after the war no doubt made her feel like a freak deep down. It's still not remorse as such.Helen treated Monika with kindness and support at the reunion. But she couldn't resist taking a swipe at Monika when she was confusedly trying to explain her denial as a child. Then Helen attacked her as still being in denial which is certainly not the case. But she still condones her mother ( ""she did her best/ she told me therere was nothing she could do,"") which indirectly, Helen seized upon and rightly so.There is gruesome footage of Monika's father's hanging. The real horror is how complacent he is even on the 2nd and 3rd attempts. As Helen points out,  not in malice but in point of fact, there is no justice in the world if his death was so mercifully simple. I think he should have been left to starve to death because it would have brought home to him the long misery he put/s his victims through and given victims like Helen real restitution. Even today perpetuators of genocide go largely unscathed.",3,not what it appears but very interesting,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,3323,"['longer', 'film', 'went', 'more', 'disconcerting', 'uncomfortable', 'was', 'see', 'how', 'bright', 'malice', 'Helen', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'old', 'wounds', 'were', 'opened', 'up', 'film', 'meeting', 'Monika', 'photos', 'young', 'woman', 'husband', 'bear', 'traces', 'too', 'How', 'could', 'husband', 'let', 'time', 'heal', 'Other', 'Jews', 'not', 'so', 'fortunate', 'be', 'valued', 'house-maid', 'were', 'beaten', 'down', 'spirit', 'Rather', 'fight', 'spite', 'mostly', 'people', 'allow', 'deep', 'time', 'dissassociate', 'trauma', 'gentler', 'reconciliation', 'possible', 'far', 'complete', 'dead', 'are', 'not', 'hell', 'were', 'innocent', 'Helen', 'rants', 'Monika', 'beside', 'graves', 'Such', 'cruelty', 'been', 'going', 'centuries', 'moreover', 'still', 'not', 'over.Maybe', 'thousand', 'years', 'today', 'such', 'barbarism', 'genocideS', 'will', 'be', 'sniffed', 'regard', 'medaevil', 'instruments', 'torture', 'will', 'take', 'intellect', 'not', 'emotion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'swept', 'away', 'her.Meanwhile', 'Monika', 'as', 'shaken', 'rape', 'victim', 'suffering', 'common', 'delusion', 'rape', 'fault', 'main', 'point', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'explore', 'was', 'shakiness', 'do', 'mother', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'Monika', 'taken', 'bull', 'horns', 'one', 'uncertainty', 'relationship', 'was', 'perpetuated', 'Monika', 'own', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'who', 'became', 'drug', 'addict', 'too', 'much', 'bad', 'mother', 'care', 'Monika', 'grandson.Monika', 'Nazi', 'father', 'was', 'not', 'tangible', 'leave', 'Monika', 'looking', 'so', 'haggard', 'masochistic', 'reunion', 'had', 'not', 'know', 'enough', 'would', 'be', 'infected', 'such', 'raw', 'emotions', 'hidden', 'twisted', 'story', 'untellable', 'film', 'Monika', 'had', 'tried', 'piece', 'together', 'mother', 'terms', 'mother', 'accountability', 'accountability', 'Apparently', 'Thankfully', 'Monika', 'never', 'fully', 'true', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'mysteriously', 'Monika', 'daughter', 'what', 'kind', 'b', 'ch', 'would', 'accuse', 'being', 'just', 'father', 'suicide', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'effortless', 'right', 'pill', 'Helen', 'vividly', 'face-masks', 'killed', 'same', 'time', 'looks', 'were', 'fading', 'could', 'be', 'denying', 'rot', 'inside', 'keeping', 'vanity', 'public', 'consensus', 'war', 'doubt', 'made', 'feel', 'freak', 'deep', 'down', 'still', 'not', 'remorse', 'such.Helen', 'treated', 'Monika', 'kindness', 'support', 'reunion', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'taking', 'swipe', 'Monika', 'when', 'was', 'confusedly', 'trying', 'explain', 'denial', 'child', 'Then', 'Helen', 'attacked', 'still', 'being', 'denial', 'certainly', 'not', 'case', 'still', 'mother', 'did', 'best/', 'told', 'was', 'nothing', 'could', 'do', 'indirectly', 'Helen', 'seized', 'upon', 'rightly', 'gruesome', 'footage', 'Monika', 'father', 'hanging', 'real', 'horror', 'how', 'complacent', 'even', '2nd', '3rd', 'attempts', 'Helen', 'out', 'not', 'malice', 'point', 'fact', 'justice', 'world', 'death', 'was', 'so', 'mercifully', 'simple', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'starve', 'death', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'home', 'long', 'misery', 'victims', 'given', 'victims', 'Helen', 'real', 'restitution', 'Even', 'today', 'perpetuators', 'genocide', 'go', 'largely', 'unscathed']",Inheritance

Pouliot,"[63, 67]","Monika is the real-life daughter of Amon Goth, the infamous commandant of the Plaszow concentration camp and a main subject of the ""Schindler's List."" Monika, a tall, rangy and emotionally fragile woman, has spent a lifetime coming to terms with the monster who was her father. In his film, she arranges to meet Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig, who along with her own mother was employed as a cook by Goth at Plaszow. The women hope for a cathartic encounter that will purge them of their shame and horror.Oddly, Monika comes off as the more sympathetic of the two women. Her emotions are raw, unhealed and close to the surface. Helen has lived for years with the effects of the cruelty experienced and witnessed at the camp, and her story is smoother for frequent repetition. Both women clearly are victims, and both bear the scars and shame of the past. I felt viscerally how passing through the Holocaust changed lives forever, despite the passage of decades. And I saw how the evil of the fathers is visited on future generations.The film is generally easy to watch, with many Goth family photos interspersed with photos of Jews being herded onto tricks or marched off to work. An exception is a graphic filmed execution, which though bloodless, is affecting. Such such footage is rarely seen on sanitized American television.The subtext of ""Inheritance"" is a meditation on the question of evil. How could the serene and sensitive Monika have been sired by one of the twentieth century's more brutal villains?  Her story shows that biology need NOT be destiny.

Yet, whatever pain you feel for these two ladies, you know it is NOTHING compared to what they have endured.What of Helen Jonas? This outwardly normal lady is shown to have developed some amazing skills in suppressing the horror of her youth. As I type these words, I know each one is a complete waste of time because THERE ARE NO WORDS that can sufficiently describe what she has experienced---and the subsequent pain of having to live with it. And as if that wasn't quite enough, she has the added pleasure of watching her husband be tormented to death by mental anguish. Yet she still smiles and loves life. Amazing.Then there is Monika Hertwig. She hurts too. Yes, it cannot possibly be the same level of pain as Helen's, but it is pain nevertheless; and it is heartbreaking to see her attempt to find meaning in it all. Can any of us begin to imagine seeing your Father portrayed in Schindler's List and knowing full well that is it THE TRUTH? Surely the bottom fell out from under Monika's life that day.Although, at the end, I felt somewhat better that each lady found some degree of closure, it did open a Pandora's box of troubling questions: Life. What is it? Why are we here? Why do so many suffer? Why do we continue the insanity of bearing children? Why are some blessed at birth in timing, location, good parents; while others are brought into the world under a curse, such as being born a European Jew who had to suffer through the War? Nobody knows. Nobody will ever know. We are just...HERE.One thing is certain though. World War II was the single biggest cataclysm in human history.

However, when she said to the producer of this film ""I am not my father,"" there was never a more true statement. It must be so difficult for someone to find out that they are the child of a mass murderer.  One can either live in denial and embrace their parents for the life they led under the Third Reich, or they can admonish it, and acknowledge the evil that Nazism was and is. I think the latter is more difficult for these children of Nazis.It's not so much the fact that Monika has come to terms with what her infamous father did, but the fact that she was confused and horrified to know that her mother did nothing, and stood by Amon Goeth's side and loved the man.  Afterall, it was her mother Ruth, that she grew up and lived with.  Amon was executed when she was a baby.  Even Helen Jonas wanted to understand what could make the man so evil.As for poor Helen, the Holocaust is something that will never leave her and has affected her family, even many years after her liberation.  It has also affected Monika. We have heard the horrible testimony of Holocaust survivors, and the stories never leave you.  However, the difference with this film and the survivor testimonies is the fact that here are two women, both living on opposite sides of the coin, and both wanted to understand what is probably incomprehensible as the horrors of the Holocaust, to which Amon Goeth fully and happily participated.From a psychological perspective, this film is extremely fascinating.",5,Children of perpetrators - interesting perspective,1246579200,"07 3, 2009",2009,1659,"['have', 'say', 'admire', 'Monika', 'suppose', 'could', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'admiring', 'worshipping', 'father', 'Nazi', 'dogma', 'so', 'many', 'perpetrators', 'children', 'have', 'done', 'However', 'when', 'said', 'producer', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'father', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'true', 'statement', 'must', 'be', 'so', 'difficult', 'someone', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'child', 'mass', 'murderer', 'One', 'can', 'either', 'live', 'denial', 'embrace', 'parents', 'life', 'led', 'Third', 'Reich', 'can', 'admonish', 'acknowledge', 'evil', 'Nazism', 'was', 'think', 'latter', 'more', 'difficult', 'children', 'Nazis.It', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'Monika', 'come', 'terms', 'what', 'infamous', 'father', 'did', 'fact', 'was', 'confused', 'horrified', 'know', 'mother', 'did', 'nothing', 'stood', 'Amon', 'Goeth', 'side', 'loved', 'man', 'Afterall', 'was', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'grew', 'up', 'lived', 'Amon', 'was', 'executed', 'when', 'was', 'baby', 'Even', 'Helen', 'Jonas', 'wanted', 'understand', 'what', 'could', 'make', 'man', 'so', 'evil.As', 'poor', 'Helen', 'Holocaust', 'something', 'will', 'never', 'leave', 'affected', 'family', 'even', 'many', 'years', 'liberation', 'also', 'affected', 'Monika', 'have', 'heard', 'horrible', 'testimony', 'Holocaust', 'survivors', 'stories', 'never', 'leave', 'However', 'difference', 'film', 'survivor', 'testimonies', 'fact', 'here', 'are', 'two', 'women', 'living', 'opposite', 'sides', 'coin', 'wanted', 'understand', 'what', 'probably', 'incomprehensible', 'horrors', 'Holocaust', 'Amon', 'Goeth', 'fully', 'happily', 'participated.From', 'psychological', 'perspective', 'film', 'extremely', 'fascinating']",Inheritance

Unlike other reviewers, I did not feel more sympathetic towards Monika, in fact I found her a bit strange. I felt she seemed very unaware of what went on during the holocaust, and some of the things she said to Helen were very inappropriate  - such as telling her ""I was told the Jews were killed because they were dirty and diseased"". Even if she was told that, she should know better by now, and should have never have said something like that to someone who suffered so much.Does Helen come off as the more cold of the two? Yes, of course. She was taught at a very young age that showing emotion can get you killed. How was she supposed to react to the daughter of her tormenter? Treat her like a long-lost sister? I thought it was incredibly generous of her to meet her at all.

1059558,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B000NPO3D2,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[26, 29]","""Inheritance""  is a documentary that tells the story of two women with very different scars from the World War II genocide of European Jews.Now in her 60's, Monika Hertwig has struggled a lifetime with what she learned at age 11 -- that her father, Amon Goeth, had not been killed in World War II like other soldiers, but was hanged as a war criminal when she was a baby.  Over the years, she forced herself to learn more about Amon, but when Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" came out in 1993, Monika became sick with the truth.Helen Jones was 15 years old when she arrived with other Jews at the Plaszow Camp in Poland, which was both a work camp and a death camp.  She was singled out by Amon Goeth to live in his house as a servant.  Decades after the Holocaust, Helen's appearance in a German television documentary captured Monika's attention, and the two women arranged to meet at the Plaszow concentration camp memorial to the thousands who died there.Director James Moll (""The Last Days"") tells a fascinating story of the effect of the Holocaust on two individuals decades later.  We see Monika's compulsion to learn more about her father, a man she had never known, and the pain with which she learns the extent of her father's crimes.  The documentary also shows the power of film to move people.  It was Ralph Fiennes' chilling portrayal of Amon Goeth in the Spielberg film that motivated Goeth's daughter to come to terms with the kind of man her father was.",5,"Excellent, Moving Documentary",1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,1475,"['Inheritance', 'documentary', 'story', 'two', 'women', 'very', 'different', 'scars', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'genocide', 'European', 'Jews.Now', '60', 'Monika', 'Hertwig', 'struggled', 'lifetime', 'what', 'learned', 'age', '11', 'father', 'Amon', 'Goeth', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'killed', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'other', 'soldiers', 'was', 'hanged', 'war', 'criminal', 'when', 'was', 'baby', 'years', 'forced', 'learn', 'more', 'Amon', 'when', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Schindler', 'List', 'came', 'out', '1993', 'Monika', 'became', 'sick', 'truth.Helen', 'Jones', 'was', '15', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'arrived', 'other', 'Jews', 'Plaszow', 'Camp', 'Poland', 'was', 'work', 'camp', 'death', 'camp', 'was', 'singled', 'out', 'Amon', 'Goeth', 'live', 'house', 'servant', 'Decades', 'Holocaust', 'Helen', 'appearance', 'German', 'television', 'documentary', 'captured', 'Monika', 'attention', 'two', 'women', 'arranged', 'meet', 'Plaszow', 'concentration', 'camp', 'memorial', 'thousands', 'who', 'died', 'there.Director', 'James', 'Moll', 'Last', 'Days', 'fascinating', 'story', 'effect', 'Holocaust', 'two', 'individuals', 'decades', 'later', 'see', 'Monika', 'compulsion', 'learn', 'more', 'father', 'man', 'had', 'never', 'known', 'pain', 'extent', 'father', 'crimes', 'documentary', 'also', 'power', 'film', 'move', 'people', 'was', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'chilling', 'portrayal', 'Amon', 'Goeth', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'motivated', 'Goeth', 'daughter', 'come', 'terms', 'kind', 'man', 'father', 'was']",Inheritance

1059561,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000NPO3D2,Z Hayes,"[15, 16]","In director James Moll's ""Inheritance"", we are introduced to two women who have something in common - they are both connected to an infamous war criminal, Amon Goeth, commandant of Plaszow concentration camp during WW II, who was eventually hanged for war crimes.Monika Hertwig was Amon Goeth's daughter and only child, though she never knew her father since she was born just before he was hanged. Despite this relative unfamiliarity with her own father, Hertwig is very much affected by his actions, carrying the burden of guilt all these years. Her most intense impression of him is Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Amon in the movie ""Schindler's List."" When Hertwig sees an interview with Helen Jonas on television, a Jewish woman and former Plaszow inmate who had been a slave worker in Amon Goeth's household during the war, she decides to meet her to get a better understanding of who her father really was.The documentary shows viewers these two women's journey - Hertwig from Germany and Jonas from New Jersey to the site of the Plaszow camp. Their meeting is poignant for all the raw emotions it stirs up in both women. Helen Jonas' anger and sorrow at what was done to her and other innocents is evident, but she also shows compassion towards Monika Hertwig who ironically appears to be the more vulnerable of the two, a rather bewildered expression on her face as she listens to Jonas' recounting the events of the past.Both women are ultimately victims of a ruthless and merciless man, though they have been affected in different ways. Monika Hertwig is the daughter who struggles to understand what kind of man her father was and why he did what he did, carrying the burden of her father's sins. Helen Jonas not only suffered untold depravity during WW II, but continued to suffer through the years, struggling to come to terms with all the horrors she and others endured during those terrible times.There are some extras on this DVD: a 5 min interview with the director and cinematographer, ""Behind the Score"" where the viewer gets a look at the actual recording of the score, a bio of the director etc.I would highly recommend this documentary to those who are interested in the Holocaust.",4,Poignant documentary of two women struggling to come to terms with their past,1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,2200,"['director', 'James', 'Moll', 'Inheritance', 'are', 'introduced', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'something', 'common', 'are', 'connected', 'infamous', 'war', 'criminal', 'Amon', 'Goeth', 'commandant', 'Plaszow', 'concentration', 'camp', 'WW', 'II', 'who', 'was', 'eventually', 'hanged', 'war', 'crimes.Monika', 'Hertwig', 'was', 'Amon', 'Goeth', 'daughter', 'only', 'child', 'never', 'knew', 'father', 'was', 'born', 'just', 'was', 'hanged', 'relative', 'unfamiliarity', 'own', 'father', 'Hertwig', 'very', 'much', 'affected', 'actions', 'carrying', 'burden', 'guilt', 'years', 'most', 'intense', 'impression', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'portrayal', 'Amon', 'movie', 'Schindler', 'List', 'When', 'Hertwig', 'interview', 'Helen', 'Jonas', 'television', 'Jewish', 'woman', 'former', 'Plaszow', 'inmate', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'slave', 'worker', 'Amon', 'Goeth', 'household', 'war', 'meet', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'who', 'father', 'really', 'was.The', 'documentary', 'shows', 'viewers', 'two', 'women', 'journey', 'Hertwig', 'Germany', 'Jonas', 'New', 'Jersey', 'site', 'Plaszow', 'camp', 'meeting', 'poignant', 'raw', 'emotions', 'up', 'women', 'Helen', 'Jonas', 'anger', 'sorrow', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'other', 'innocents', 'evident', 'also', 'compassion', 'towards', 'Monika', 'Hertwig', 'who', 'ironically', 'be', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'two', 'rather', 'bewildered', 'expression', 'face', 'Jonas', 'recounting', 'events', 'past.Both', 'women', 'are', 'ultimately', 'victims', 'ruthless', 'merciless', 'man', 'have', 'been', 'affected', 'different', 'ways', 'Monika', 'Hertwig', 'daughter', 'who', 'understand', 'what', 'kind', 'man', 'father', 'was', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'carrying', 'burden', 'father', 'sins', 'Helen', 'Jonas', 'not', 'only', 'suffered', 'untold', 'depravity', 'WW', 'II', 'continued', 'suffer', 'years', 'struggling', 'come', 'terms', 'horrors', 'others', 'endured', 'terrible', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD', '5', 'min', 'interview', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'Score', 'where', 'viewer', 'look', 'actual', 'recording', 'score', 'bio', 'director', 'etc.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'Holocaust']",Inheritance
