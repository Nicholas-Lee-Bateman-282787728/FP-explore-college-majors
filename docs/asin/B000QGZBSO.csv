Having said that, I ordered this product because all of the older exercise videos have not been released on DVD, only VHS (all of which I own already). I ordered this DVD because I really like how Susan Powter worked me out in all her other stuff, and hey, its one I don't have. She has changed allot in the last 10 years, but still knows how to be encouraging, and not overly pushy or annoyingly peppy! I gave it 4 stars because its a good work out Susan Powter style! The woman is my all time favorite fitness instructor. BUT.. I took away a star, because she definately needs to fire her cutting room staff. I find myself doing exactly what she is doing, at the exact tempo, and next thing I know, they cut to another scene, and Im off step. Its highly annoying. It happens several times throught the video. There is even a part in the routine where she is telling the viewer how to do a step, and they have a split screen. One half is her top half telling us how to do it, and the other half is supposed to be showing her bottom half doing what she is explaining, but its a completely different step. If you haven't ever done Susan Powter, then Id have to advise you to do some of her other VHS stuff before trying this. I would have been completely put off by this if I hadn't been formerly introduced to her style, and forms through the other videos.",4,Do-able but messy!!,1205452800,"03 14, 2008",2008,1426,"['Okay', 'first', 'let', 'say', 'AM', 'SUSAN', 'POWTER', 'FAN', 'FROM', 'WAY', 'BACK', 'Having', 'said', 'ordered', 'product', 'older', 'exercise', 'videos', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'only', 'VHS', 'own', 'already', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'really', 'how', 'Susan', 'Powter', 'worked', 'out', 'other', 'stuff', 'hey', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'changed', 'allot', 'last', '10', 'years', 'still', 'how', 'be', 'encouraging', 'not', 'overly', 'pushy', 'annoyingly', 'peppy', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'good', 'work', 'Susan', 'Powter', 'style', 'woman', 'time', 'favorite', 'fitness', 'instructor', 'BUT..', 'took', 'away', 'star', 'definately', 'fire', 'cutting', 'room', 'staff', 'find', 'doing', 'exactly', 'what', 'doing', 'exact', 'tempo', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'cut', 'scene', 'Im', 'off', 'step', 'highly', 'annoying', 'several', 'times', 'throught', 'video', 'even', 'part', 'routine', 'where', 'telling', 'viewer', 'how', 'do', 'step', 'have', 'split', 'screen', 'One', 'half', 'top', 'half', 'telling', 'how', 'do', 'other', 'half', 'supposed', 'be', 'showing', 'bottom', 'half', 'doing', 'what', 'explaining', 'completely', 'different', 'step', 'have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'done', 'Susan', 'Powter', 'then', 'Id', 'have', 'advise', 'do', 'other', 'VHS', 'stuff', 'trying', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'put', 'off', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'formerly', 'introduced', 'style', 'forms', 'other', 'videos']",Susan Powter Burn Fat Lifestyle Exchange Exercise DVD

It doesn't require any fancy shoes or equipment.  It is fun and exciting.  It has several levels of modification for ANY fitness level.  I am a LARGE lady, and let me tell you I found I could do it.  The great thing is I did it with out feeling like I was having a heart attack or was going to pass out!  It has so many modifications, for any fitness level, I sincerely believe that anybody, including the incredibly fit and gorgeous can get some thing out of it.  I recommend any body and every body try this fitness DVD out.  A huge plus is Susan's great personality.

1076342,AUZUOSOBRZ46M,B000QGZBSO,"Nicole M. Williams ""N. Williams""","[1, 1]",This workout is very low impact.  The DVD summary didn't indicate that the user would need a step.  Susan does the work out bare foot but gives you the option to wear shoes.  This workout is great if you're a beginer.  You could even do it without the step.  For the moderate to advanced level person it's too slow and the trainer tends to talk too much.,2,Slow to Burn,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,354,"['workout', 'very', 'low', 'impact', 'DVD', 'summary', 'did', ""n't"", 'indicate', 'user', 'would', 'need', 'step', 'Susan', 'work', 'out', 'bare', 'foot', 'option', 'wear', 'shoes', 'workout', 'great', ""'re"", 'beginer', 'could', 'even', 'do', 'step', 'moderate', 'advanced', 'level', 'person', 'too', 'slow', 'trainer', 'talk', 'too', 'much']",Susan Powter Burn Fat Lifestyle Exchange Exercise DVD

I figured she must be onto something to get so famous, but I realize it was her sloganeering and barking that made her so memorable.  This does not translate well in a workout.  I just could not take her voice, her vague instructions and forced energy.  Very distracting.  Also, she says you don't need any extra equipment for the workout, but this is followed by a checklist of other things you'll need in order to do it.I threw this right in the trash and moved on to the Biggest Loser Cardio workout which is light hears ahead of this irritating DVD.",1,So annoying,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,620,"['most', 'remember', 'Stop', 'insanity', 'infomercials', 'figured', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'get', 'so', 'famous', 'realize', 'was', 'sloganeering', 'barking', 'made', 'so', 'memorable', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'workout', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'voice', 'vague', 'instructions', 'forced', 'energy', 'Very', 'distracting', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'extra', 'equipment', 'workout', 'followed', 'checklist', 'other', 'things', ""'ll"", 'need', 'order', 'do', 'it.I', 'threw', 'right', 'trash', 'moved', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'Cardio', 'workout', 'light', 'hears', 'ahead', 'irritating', 'DVD']",Susan Powter Burn Fat Lifestyle Exchange Exercise DVD
