761532,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B0000A2ZU3,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[8, 8]","If there is a common theme running through Billy Bob Thornton's dramatic roles, it would have to be a man's search for redemption. It can be found in SLING BLADE, A SIMPLE PLAN, THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, MONSTER'S BALL, THE BADGE, and again in LEVITY, the film directorial debut of screenwriter Ed Solomon. Unlike more 'commercial' actors, who would prefer playing innocent victims framed for crimes (or would be 'heroic' in committing 'justifiable' deeds), Thornton's characters are guilty of their trespasses, and accept their punishment as deserved. This gives his performances a sense of reality that is always interesting to watch.In LEVITY, Thornton is Manual Jordan, a 'lifer' who has spent over twenty years in prison for shooting and killing a kid during a convenience store robbery, as a youth. The act was not a crime of passion, it was simply an involuntary reaction to a quizzical 'look' the kid gave him, an expression that would bond the two of them for years to come.When a parole board decides to commute Jordan's sentence (&quot;Why?&quot; he asks, stunned by the decision after saying he was content to remain in prison), the middle-aged man finds himself alone in an alien, indifferent world, with only the kid's 'ghost' as company.Jordan decides to try and help the victim's sister, Adele (the ageless Holly Hunter), without revealing his identity (&quot;If you're trying to 'hit' on me,&quot; she quips, &quot;I have to warn you, over the years, my standards have lowered...&quot;). She has her hands full with a wild teenaged son, and can't quite figure out this taciturn, long-haired vagrant!Answering a ringing pay phone, Jordan finds his way to a jaded lay minister (Morgan Freeman, excellent, as always), who, recognizing him as an ex-con, provides him with a place to stay, and a job, cleaning and directing teens from a dance club into the broken-down mission he runs, next door. When Jordan tells the old preacher that he doesn't believe in God, the old man snaps, &quot;I'm not asking you to! I'm asking you to work!&quot; One of the rowdy 'club' teens (Kirsten Dunst), the daughter of a 'one-hit wonder' singer on the skids, finds herself drawn to Jordan, despite his obvious disapproval of her lifestyle.As with all the best 'indies', there is a richness of character in LEVITY, with each actor in top form. Subtly building to a surprising revelation and an emotional climax, the film may not appeal to audiences who prefer pyrotechnics to plot, but if you like movies with believable characters, and an involving story that unfolds at it's own pace, you'll find it to be a very rewarding experience!",5,Billy Bob Thornton In Excellent Redemption Drama...,1061596800,"08 23, 2003",2003,2633,"['common', 'theme', 'running', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'man', 'search', 'redemption', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'SLING', 'BLADE', 'A', 'SIMPLE', 'PLAN', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'THERE', 'MONSTER', 'BALL', 'THE', 'BADGE', 'again', 'LEVITY', 'film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'screenwriter', 'Ed', 'Solomon', 'more', ""'commercial"", 'actors', 'who', 'would', 'prefer', 'playing', 'innocent', 'victims', 'framed', 'crimes', 'would', 'be', ""'heroic"", 'committing', ""'justifiable"", 'deeds', 'Thornton', 'characters', 'are', 'guilty', 'trespasses', 'accept', 'punishment', 'deserved', 'performances', 'sense', 'reality', 'always', 'interesting', 'watch.In', 'LEVITY', 'Thornton', 'Manual', 'Jordan', ""'lifer"", 'who', 'spent', 'twenty', 'years', 'prison', 'shooting', 'killing', 'kid', 'convenience', 'store', 'robbery', 'youth', 'act', 'was', 'not', 'crime', 'passion', 'was', 'simply', 'involuntary', 'reaction', 'quizzical', ""'look"", 'kid', 'gave', 'expression', 'would', 'bond', 'two', 'years', 'come.When', 'parole', 'board', 'commute', 'Jordan', 'sentence', 'quot', 'Why', 'quot', 'stunned', 'decision', 'saying', 'was', 'content', 'remain', 'prison', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'alone', 'alien', 'indifferent', 'world', 'only', 'kid', ""'ghost"", 'company.Jordan', 'decides', 'try', 'help', 'victim', 'sister', 'Adele', 'ageless', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'revealing', 'identity', 'quot', ""'re"", 'trying', ""'hit"", 'quot', 'quot', 'have', 'warn', 'years', 'standards', 'have', 'lowered', 'quot', 'hands', 'full', 'wild', 'teenaged', 'son', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'taciturn', 'long-haired', 'vagrant', 'Answering', 'ringing', 'pay', 'phone', 'Jordan', 'way', 'jaded', 'lay', 'minister', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'excellent', 'always', 'who', 'recognizing', 'ex-con', 'place', 'stay', 'job', 'cleaning', 'directing', 'teens', 'dance', 'club', 'broken-down', 'mission', 'next', 'door', 'When', 'Jordan', 'old', 'preacher', ""n't"", 'believe', 'God', 'old', 'man', 'quot', ""'m"", 'not', 'asking', ""'m"", 'asking', 'work', 'quot', 'One', 'rowdy', 'teens', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'daughter', ""'one-hit"", 'wonder', 'singer', 'skids', 'drawn', 'Jordan', 'obvious', 'disapproval', 'lifestyle.As', 'best', ""'indies"", 'richness', 'character', 'LEVITY', 'actor', 'top', 'form', 'Subtly', 'building', 'surprising', 'revelation', 'emotional', 'climax', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'audiences', 'who', 'prefer', 'pyrotechnics', 'plot', 'like', 'movies', 'believable', 'characters', 'involving', 'story', 'own', 'pace', ""'ll"", 'find', 'be', 'very', 'rewarding', 'experience']",Levity

I have been holding off on watching this movie for a long time simply because Billy Bob Thornton's long hair on the cover box kind of turned me off from the movie. After watching it (and finding out his long hair is due to 21 years in prison, probably not too many haircuts during that time) I was suprised how much I enjoyed it. The acting from Morgan Freeman, Billy Bob Thornton, Holly Hunter, and even Kirsten Dunst was great, and this strong story about redemption will leave you pondering how you might react in such a situation.This movie didn't get a lot of good reviews (I don't know why), but I still enjoyed it and I think most audiences might too. It is a tad slow but the story is strong and there is some good humor in it to keep it moving.

In spite of the presence of Billy Bob Thornton, Kirsten Dunst, Morgan Freeman and Holly Hunter, the film didn't do well when it was theatrically released so let's just hope that the DVD market will give it a second chance. Because LEVITY simply deserves a second chance.LEVITY is a fable with these characters who seem to be all protected by a visible or, for some of them, an invisible presence. So, Billy Bob Thornton, with the help of Morgan Freeman, will be able to find peace in his mind and Kirsten Dunst, Holly Hunter and her son will be able to make peace with their past thanks to Thornton. The buckle is closed and, as in a fable, LEVITY delivers a strong moral message.

I hate movies that are predictable (I can usually predict what is going to happen next in a Hollywood movie), but this one was SO REFRESHING, because I was constantly surprised by each upcoming scene and dialog!!!It is a movie about an adult trying to make amends and trying to receive forgiveness after killing someone while young and immature.  It stirs up plenty of emotion, and had me weeping a few times.The area where the movie shows weakness in the script is where some of the characters said they didn't believe in God.  If that's really how they believed, then why seek forgiveness from a stranger?  Why show any compassion or remorse at all?  In fact, you might as well kill whoever you like IF there's no final judgment and IF God isn't watching!  The problem is that the characters actions didn't always line up with that belief system.  (And of course, there is going to be a judgment, just read the Bible for yourself if you have any doubts.  The apostle Paul, who was once anti-Christian, later spoke with the risen Jesus, and willingly died for his faith in Jesus.  Paul said we will ALL be judged by Jesus, and that EVERY knee shall bow to Jesus.)Nevertheless, I give this movie a strong 5-stars.

A convict who accepts the punishment of life imprisonment for his murder of a young man in a fast food store 22 years prior is abruptly released by a prison board who decide that his exceptional prison behaviour merits his sentence being commuted.  Suddenly thrust from his cell and accepted destiny back into the world where his crime occurred, the man's only drive is to find the sister of his vistim and make amends for his crime.  He walks (somnolently, accompanied by the recurring ghost vision of his victim) thru the dark alleys of some unidentified wintry city, encounters a black 'minister/soup kitchen man', accepts employment as a custodian, and becomes involved with the minister's attempt to salvage the night clubbers who do drugs etc, falling into the chasm of despair from where the convict has history. His presence in this setting has some positive effects on the lost ones' lives.  He finds the sister of the man he murdered and in attempting to make things right, saves her teenage son from his vendetta for revenge of his attempted murder.  Gestures are made, things work out and other things do't work out: we are left without knowing the true results of these attempts at redemption.The cast includes extraordinarily subdued and subtle performances by Billy Bob Thornton, Morgan Freeman, Holly Hunter, and Kirsten Dunst.  The smarmy underbelly of a city is captured authentically and artistcially by the cinematographer, and the director paces this quiet, inward tale with a sense of a death march.

But Jordan knows he cannot bring back Abner Easley and does not believe ""in some God that's gonna open His arms to me even if I did.""  That takes care of steps three and four, and since we can never be in the same place twice, Jordan knows he will never be redeemed.

We want to feel compassion for Jordan, but we know that he is probably right and that he is never going to be able to attain redemption.

Instead the ex-con finds himself in strange almost dreamlike world where answering a pay phone in the middle of the night gets you a job and a place to stay at a mission that operates across the street from a nightclub.  The place is run by Miles Evans (Morgan Freeman), an eccentric preacher, who allows kids to park for free at his lot if they come in and sit for 15 minutes while he preaches at them.  Jordan's job is to stand out in the cold and get the kids to sign in with their names and time of arrival.Of all the faceless kids who wander through each night one stands out, young Sofia Mellinger (Kirsten Dunst).  She seems like a drug loving party girl, but Jordan sees somebody who is trying pretty hard to kill herself.  However, Sofia is not his primary concern.  That would be trying to get Adele Easley (Holly Hunter) to let him help her take her bags home.  She, of course, is the sister of the boy he killed, who knows has a son named Abner who is essentially the same age as his namesake was 23 years earlier.  Jordan is persistent enough without being too pushy, and his formal way of speaking and strange manner catches Adele's interest, although she is quick to point out that her standards have slipped over the years.  However, Jordan is not looking for romance and that is only way of the things that he cannot tell Adele.Evans has a pretty good idea of what Jordan is up to, especially after Adele calls the mission looking for somebody whose name she does not know.  While the preacher agrees with Jordan that redemption is impossible, he also supports the idea that trying is not the worst of all possible fates.  Besides, if he cannot save himself there is the possibility that Jordan might be able to save young Abner or Sofia.  Beyond that there is the question of what will happen when Adele finds out Jordan's true identity, because you know that moment is going to come at a pivotal point in the story.The performances in ""Levity"" are the most compelling part of the film, which is hardly surprising given you have Thornton, Freeman and Hunter in the three key roles.  Dunst is a bit outclassed but then her character is not written at the same level; her strong point is the way she can hold her own in verbal sparing with the juvenile delinquents who are sent to the mission to hear first Evans and then Jordan talk to them.  Mostly this movie is a series of scenes between Jordan and the other three characters, as well as with young Abner (Geoffrey Wigdor).  Thornton, who is always looking or different ways to play every one of his characters, is going for a level of subtlety here that is a shade short of complete inertia.  Yet, for the most part, it works.Most certainly there will be those who will find ""Levity"" to be too preachy and that the ending might be too contrived.  But this is a film that has an appropriately subdued notion of what should constitute a happy ending under these tragic circumstances.  Ultimately, its biggest problem could well be that the point is made early on in the film.  Jordan has accepted his fate as being well deserved and despite the fact that he cannot change anything or find peace, he tries to do something anyway.  By that standard how well he succeeds does not matter because that would not be the point of the lesson.  If you understand that, then you may well find most of this 2003 drama to be superfluous.",4,Tonight's lesson: trying to make amends when you cannot,1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,4739,"['Manual', 'Jordan', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'been', 'sitting', 'prison', 'cell', '23', 'years', 'where', 'only', 'decoration', 'newspaper', 'photograph', 'teenager', 'killed', 'convenience', 'store', 'robbery', 'voice', 'book', 'written', '11th', 'century', 'are', 'five', 'steps', 'necessary', 'make', 'amends', 'acknowledge', 'what', 'did', 'feel', 'remorse', 'make', 'right', 'what', 'did', 'wrong', 'then', 'make', 'right', 'God', 'then', 'can', 'be', 'redeemed', 'Jordan', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'back', 'Abner', 'Easley', 'not', 'believe', 'God', 'gon', 'open', 'arms', 'even', 'did', 'care', 'steps', 'three', 'four', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'place', 'twice', 'Jordan', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'redeemed', 'So', 'accepted', 'place', 'prison', 'surprised', 'when', 'sentence', 'commuted', 'time', 'served', 'thrown', 'back', 'world', 'Even', 'hopeless', 'Jordan', 'atone', 'horrible', 'crime', 'Levity', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'forgiven', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'forgive', 'want', 'feel', 'compassion', 'Jordan', 'know', 'probably', 'right', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'attain', 'redemption', 'writer-director', 'Ed', 'Solomon', 'who', 'own', 'cross', 'bear', 'co-writer', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'Excellent', 'Adventure', 'not', 'really', 'return', 'Jordan', 'real', 'world', 'Instead', 'ex-con', 'finds', 'strange', 'almost', 'world', 'where', 'answering', 'pay', 'phone', 'middle', 'night', 'job', 'place', 'stay', 'mission', 'street', 'nightclub', 'place', 'run', 'Miles', 'Evans', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'eccentric', 'preacher', 'who', 'kids', 'park', 'free', 'lot', 'come', 'sit', '15', 'minutes', 'Jordan', 'job', 'stand', 'out', 'cold', 'get', 'kids', 'sign', 'names', 'time', 'arrival.Of', 'faceless', 'kids', 'who', 'wander', 'night', 'one', 'out', 'young', 'Sofia', 'Mellinger', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'drug', 'loving', 'party', 'girl', 'Jordan', 'somebody', 'who', 'trying', 'pretty', 'hard', 'kill', 'However', 'Sofia', 'not', 'primary', 'concern', 'would', 'be', 'trying', 'get', 'Adele', 'Easley', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'let', 'help', 'take', 'bags', 'home', 'course', 'sister', 'boy', 'killed', 'who', 'son', 'named', 'Abner', 'who', 'essentially', 'same', 'age', 'namesake', 'was', '23', 'years', 'earlier', 'Jordan', 'persistent', 'enough', 'being', 'too', 'pushy', 'formal', 'way', 'speaking', 'strange', 'manner', 'catches', 'Adele', 'interest', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'standards', 'have', 'slipped', 'years', 'However', 'Jordan', 'not', 'looking', 'romance', 'only', 'way', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'Adele.Evans', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'Jordan', 'up', 'especially', 'Adele', 'mission', 'looking', 'somebody', 'name', 'not', 'know', 'preacher', 'Jordan', 'redemption', 'impossible', 'also', 'idea', 'trying', 'not', 'worst', 'possible', 'fates', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'possibility', 'Jordan', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'young', 'Abner', 'Sofia', 'Beyond', 'question', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'Adele', 'out', 'Jordan', 'true', 'identity', 'know', 'moment', 'going', 'come', 'pivotal', 'point', 'story.The', 'performances', 'Levity', 'are', 'most', 'compelling', 'part', 'film', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'given', 'have', 'Thornton', 'Freeman', 'Hunter', 'three', 'key', 'roles', 'Dunst', 'bit', 'outclassed', 'then', 'character', 'not', 'written', 'same', 'level', 'strong', 'point', 'way', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'verbal', 'sparing', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'who', 'are', 'sent', 'mission', 'hear', 'first', 'Evans', 'then', 'Jordan', 'talk', 'Mostly', 'movie', 'series', 'scenes', 'Jordan', 'other', 'three', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'Abner', 'Geoffrey', 'Wigdor', 'Thornton', 'who', 'always', 'looking', 'different', 'ways', 'play', 'one', 'characters', 'going', 'level', 'subtlety', 'here', 'shade', 'short', 'complete', 'inertia', 'most', 'part', 'works.Most', 'certainly', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'Levity', 'be', 'too', 'preachy', 'ending', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'contrived', 'film', 'appropriately', 'subdued', 'notion', 'what', 'should', 'constitute', 'happy', 'ending', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'Ultimately', 'biggest', 'problem', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'point', 'made', 'early', 'film', 'Jordan', 'accepted', 'fate', 'being', 'well', 'deserved', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'anything', 'find', 'peace', 'do', 'something', 'anyway', 'standard', 'how', 'well', 'not', 'matter', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'point', 'lesson', 'understand', 'then', 'may', 'well', 'find', 'most', '2003', 'drama', 'be', 'superfluous']",Levity

Billy Bob Thornton is cast as a troubled man who has just been released from prison for killing a convenience store clerk in a botched robbery 23 years before.  He plays the role with quiet stoicism, wears his graying hair shoulder length and speaks in a gentle voice as he returns to the neighborhood where the crime was committed.Here, he meets Morgan Freeman, a storefront preacher with a secret of his own, and he's given a job as custodian of the place.  Kristin Durst is one of the lost young people who he comes in contact with, and in his own simple way, he seems to be making a difference in her life.  The person he has come here to meet, however, is the sister of the young man who he had murdered. Holly Hunter is cast in this role and they start to develop a deep friendship, especially when her son gets in trouble and Billy Bob Thornton comes to his aid.There's a sadness and melancholy to the entire film, which is set on cold dreary  winter streets.

Writer/director Ed Simpson gives us a story of an ex-con named Manual Jordan, who is released after spending 21 years in prison for the robbery murder of a 17 year old convenience store clerk.  He narrates his story and tells us the five steps of redemption culled from an eleventh century novel.  He seeks his own redemption by confronting his victim's sister, who now has her own son, named after her murdered brother.  Fate brings him to a community house run by a preacher who hires him for odd jobs and gets him involved with the youth.  This includes a self-destructive rich girl whom he befriends, sort of.  A patient and discerning viewer will appreciate the richness of the performances and the marvelous cinematography by Roger Deakins.  Billy Bob Thornton plays Manual with an understated tragic demeanor and does well; Holly Hunter plays the sister, also underplaying the role but mesmerizing in it; Morgan Freeman is the preacher and he is at his best as this unselfish, yet mystic, gentleman, and Kirsten Dunst is splendid as the rich girl who finds a source of salvation in Thornton.

It's apparent ugliness is its sheer inescapable  beauty.Morality does exist no matter how we try to hide.Thornton, after spending over 20 years in prison for the murder of a young convenience store clerk during a robbery gone haywire in his youth, is drawn to return to his old neighborhood to visit the older sister of the young man he killed, played by Holly Hunter.

Perhaps it is the journey that is more important to him. He finds a preacher (Morgan Freeman) who is trying to reach a bunch of teenagers and steer them away from the destructive lifestyles they're leading. He runs a makeshift church/soup kitchen across the street from a local dance club.Manual also comes in to the life of a woman (Holly Hunter) who is trying to steer her son away from the gang street life he is falling in to.

Suffering from low self-esteem and an angry alcoholic mother, she drifts closer to harms way each night.What is story has to offer is emotions in raw form. What would any of us do in extreme circumstances? Most of us will never know. These people do. Most of their lives have been impacted by one form of violence or another. These are decent people inside. People that made bad choices. The road to hell is paved with good intentions they say and little tiny mistakes. Pretty soon these little mistakes feed on themselves and before you know it, you start having BIG lapses in good judgment. How did this happen? How did I get here? ---by many little mistakes.What was most important to me in this story was the insight in to the fragility and strength of the human spirit. These people are not perfect. But each of them is hoping for something better, something more meaningful. A purpose, and maybe a little emotional justice. You can think of them all as wounded animals, trapped in a box. Most of them don't know how they got in there. They want out. They don't know how to get out, and they're growing increasingly desperate. It is in this dark place that they find their true characters. By looking their little devils in the face and choosing another path, they begin to find peace within themselves.I know that this is not always a pretty picture. But sometimes you need to look at the ugliness of humanity in order to see the beauty. Beauty is there, whether we see it or not. And that's what I think this movie is, beautiful.",5,Beauty in strange packages,1089072000,"07 6, 2004",2004,2786,"['wish', 'could', 'fill', 'library', 'movies', 'exactly', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'sort', 'watched', 'shock', 'Stories', 'quality', 'are', 'so', 'rare', 'First', 'foremost', 'forgiveness', 'character', 'story', 'feels', 'have', 'failed', 'way', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'simply', 'make', 'right', 'make', 'peace', 'Large', 'mistakes', 'little', 'mistakes', 'little', 'devils', 'tend', 'stay', 'sowing', 'seeds', 'discontent.Manual', 'Jordan', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', 'released', 'jail', '20', 'years', 'embarks', 'mission', 'find', 'redemption', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'find', 'Perhaps', 'journey', 'more', 'important', 'preacher', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'trying', 'reach', 'bunch', 'teenagers', 'steer', 'away', 'destructive', 'lifestyles', ""'re"", 'leading', 'makeshift', 'church/soup', 'kitchen', 'street', 'local', 'dance', 'club.Manual', 'also', 'life', 'woman', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'who', 'trying', 'steer', 'son', 'away', 'gang', 'street', 'life', 'falling', 'far', 'favorite', 'piece', 'story', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'emotional', 'heart', 'story', 'confused', 'party', 'girl', 'who', 'better', 'life', 'idea', 'how', 'get', 'there', 'Suffering', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'angry', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'closer', 'harms', 'way', 'night.What', 'story', 'offer', 'emotions', 'raw', 'form', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'extreme', 'circumstances', 'Most', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'people', 'do', 'Most', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'impacted', 'one', 'form', 'violence', 'are', 'decent', 'people', 'People', 'made', 'bad', 'choices', 'road', 'hell', 'paved', 'good', 'intentions', 'say', 'little', 'tiny', 'mistakes', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'little', 'mistakes', 'feed', 'know', 'start', 'having', 'BIG', 'lapses', 'good', 'judgment', 'How', 'did', 'happen', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'here', '-by', 'many', 'little', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'story', 'was', 'insight', 'fragility', 'strength', 'human', 'spirit', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'hoping', 'something', 'better', 'something', 'more', 'meaningful', 'purpose', 'maybe', 'little', 'emotional', 'justice', 'can', 'think', 'wounded', 'animals', 'trapped', 'box', 'Most', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'want', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'get', 'out', ""'re"", 'growing', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'dark', 'place', 'find', 'true', 'characters', 'looking', 'little', 'devils', 'face', 'choosing', 'path', 'begin', 'find', 'peace', 'themselves.I', 'know', 'not', 'always', 'pretty', 'picture', 'sometimes', 'need', 'look', 'ugliness', 'humanity', 'order', 'see', 'beauty', 'Beauty', 'there', 'see', 'not', 'what', 'think', 'movie', 'beautiful']",Levity

It's a very welcome addition to my DVD collection indeed. The acting is excellent and I truly enjoyed every minute of it. I particularly loved Kirsten Dunst as the drugged out club kid. I also loved Holly Hunter as the older sister of the boy that was murdered by Billy Bob Thornton. The theme of trying to right a wrong and helping others is something we should all keep in mind in the real world.",4,"Great movie, great price!",1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,509,"['had', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'Levity', 'when', 'found', '5.50', 'Wal-Mart', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'very', 'welcome', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'indeed', 'acting', 'excellent', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'particularly', 'loved', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'drugged', 'out', 'club', 'kid', 'also', 'loved', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'older', 'sister', 'boy', 'was', 'murdered', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'theme', 'trying', 'right', 'wrong', 'helping', 'others', 'something', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'real', 'world']",Levity
