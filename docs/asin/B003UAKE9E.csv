'Got the blu ray, whose picture quality is beautiful HD.As to the story, yikes. Here again, I like the art world, and thus I could enjoy the subject matter more than many.  Heather Graham and Amanda Seyfried are HOT ladies, no doubt about it.  But the story--how stupid, dull, and depressing--but mostly dull.  VERY negative, with no humor to experience, no creativity in the story.  Just people using other people throughout, as expected, but with no funny or interesting twists.  There are no likable characters except for Seyfried, whose character, like the others, is little-developed.  Even the final lines of the film in the final scene, meant to be a clever send-off for viewers . . . were not clever in the slightest.  Just dumb, like most of the rest of the dialog.Was I unhappy that I watched it?  No.  But I was expecting so much more, o.k., at least a mildly interesting plot or a clever plot twist or two.  Hopefully some ""British-chic"" qualities to the story or dialog.  More engaging characters, at least (these characters were poorly developed, for the most part).  This truly seemed like just a mediocre, pointless film put together by a film student, apart from the fact that it obviously used a medium-sized industry budget.It's based on a book . . . which must be garbage.Extras on the blu ray?  Try none, apart from a trailer and TV spot that seem to be essentially the same 3-minute commercial.Again, for the pretty women and the beautiful blu ray picture, and at $6.99, I give it 3 stars.  It didn't put me to sleep; I was mildly entertained as I was just waiting for something to happen . . . even once.Can't see myself ever watching it again, as long as there are alternative films to choose from in my collection (there are).",3,"Enjoyed it (but 1 time max!); however, it's not very good.",1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,1820,"['enjoy', 'art', 'pretty', 'women', 'thought', ""'d"", 'like', 'movie', 'blu', 'ray', 'picture', 'quality', 'beautiful', 'HD.As', 'story', 'yikes', 'Here', 'again', 'like', 'art', 'world', 'thus', 'could', 'enjoy', 'subject', 'matter', 'more', 'many', 'Graham', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'are', 'HOT', 'ladies', 'doubt', 'story', 'how', 'stupid', 'dull', 'depressing', 'mostly', 'dull', 'VERY', 'negative', 'humor', 'experience', 'creativity', 'story', 'Just', 'people', 'using', 'other', 'people', 'expected', 'funny', 'interesting', 'twists', 'are', 'likable', 'characters', 'Seyfried', 'character', 'others', 'little-developed', 'Even', 'final', 'lines', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'meant', 'be', 'clever', 'send-off', 'viewers', 'were', 'not', 'clever', 'slightest', 'Just', 'dumb', 'most', 'rest', 'dialog.Was', 'unhappy', 'watched', 'No', 'was', 'expecting', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'o.k.', 'least', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'plot', 'clever', 'plot', 'twist', 'two', 'Hopefully', 'British-chic', 'qualities', 'story', 'dialog', 'More', 'engaging', 'characters', 'least', 'characters', 'were', 'poorly', 'developed', 'most', 'part', 'truly', 'seemed', 'just', 'mediocre', 'pointless', 'film', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'student', 'apart', 'fact', 'obviously', 'used', 'medium-sized', 'industry', 'budget.It', 'based', 'book', 'must', 'be', 'garbage.Extras', 'blu', 'ray', 'Try', 'none', 'apart', 'trailer', 'TV', 'spot', 'seem', 'be', 'essentially', 'same', '3-minute', 'commercial.Again', 'pretty', 'women', 'beautiful', 'blu', 'ray', 'picture', '6.99', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'sleep', 'was', 'mildly', 'entertained', 'was', 'just', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'even', 'once.Ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'ever', 'watching', 'again', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'alternative', 'films', 'choose', 'collection', 'are']",N/A

1363331,A2HR665VU4QJG4,B003UAKE9E,"Dave ""Dave""","[2, 8]","Warning - Spoilers.This film was mean-spirited and depressing. There were no likable characters. This is not a dark comedy (as it's being marketed) - it's a very dark, depressing, and tedious drama.The portrayal of one of the lesbian characters was horribly bigoted and negative. Who wrote the script, Pat Robertson?Suicide is not art. The fact that one of the ""artists"" would incorporate an actual suicide (that she was largely responsible for) into her art was perverse. Who wants to watch a film with a scene like that?The cruelty that the characters inflicted on each other made watching this film extremely difficult. This is not entertainment. I felt just awful after finally finishing this stupid and very anti-human film.The pretentiousness of the art world was portrayed in a very fake and over-the-top manner - especially by Gillian Anderson's terrible character and that of Christopher Lee's. We get it, serious art collectors and artists are supposed to be ridiculous, eccentric, and snobby. Enough already. There was no need to make them into unbelievable caricatures of people who care more about pieces of art than their very own lives.Horrible film.

1363332,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B003UAKE9E,Eric Sanberg,"[30, 30]","This is a dark, dark look at the world of artists and those who deal in art. Calling this a black comedy is a gross understatement. Essentially everyone in this armpit of existence is in it for themselves. All are jockeying for position to get more, more, more for themselves. And they'll screw or screw over whomever they have to to get what they want.There are a couple of stories running throughout this film. On one end you have Stellan Skaarsgard (an art collector) and Danny Huston (his art broker) trying to screw each other by outbidding each other to buy a piece of art (The Boogie Woogie of the title) which the owner, Chrostopher Lee, doesn't even want to sell. Meanwhile, Skaarsgard's assistant, Heather Graham, wants his backing to open her own gallery and start with a show by a maybe up and and coming video artist. To do so she will screw said artist's current promoter and screw Skaarsgard out of his cut. And Skaarsgard's wife, Gillian Anderson, will fool around with another up and comer and then want a divorce which will lead to more people screwing other people. You get the picture.This is an acerbic view of how this part of society works. Everyone's disregard for the feelings of the people around them is unbelievable. There is a scene where Skaarsgard presents a ""gift"" to his new assistant. How, in anyone's world, this would be considered an appropriate gift is way beyond me.The director, Duncan Ward, does a great job of giving you the look and feel for that part of London. The beauty, the hipness, the wealth and the attitude. All the acting is good and the writing is, for the most part, outstanding. Some might consider it ""too"", and they're probably right which is why I didn't give this the big FIVE stars. But all in all this is a great ride. It moves at a quick pace and doesn't linger on anything too long.
