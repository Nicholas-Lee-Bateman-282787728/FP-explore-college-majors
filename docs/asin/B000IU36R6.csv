I recommend Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga instead.  Some of the reviews I've read stated that this was a harder workout than Shiva's, which is true, however, I would much rather just apply modifications to my Rodney Yee Power Yoga series (which I love) than do this.  I find this instructor and music distracting, actually almost annoying, and have never been interested enough to complete the full 75 minute program. I always find myself stopping early or fast forwarding though the workouts.  On the other hand, I find Shiva's (and Rodney's) programs to fly by and I am done before I know it.",2,Not worth it - just modify your regular yoga workout,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,740,"['was', 'looking', 'something', 'really', 'specific', 'prenatal', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'there', 'was', 'enough', 'felt', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'yoga', 'workout', 'recommend', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Prenatal', 'Yoga', 'instead', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'stated', 'was', 'harder', 'workout', 'Shiva', 'true', 'however', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'just', 'apply', 'modifications', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'series', 'love', 'do', 'find', 'instructor', 'music', 'distracting', 'actually', 'almost', 'annoying', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'interested', 'enough', 'complete', 'full', '75', 'minute', 'program', 'always', 'find', 'stopping', 'early', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'workouts', 'other', 'hand', 'find', 'Shiva', 'Rodney', 'programs', 'fly', 'am', 'done', 'know']",N/A

Whitney ""AwMC""","[0, 0]","I wouldn't recommend this dvd to a beginner yogi as the length of the practice and the poses can be challenging for someone who has never ventured into yoga before.  However, for the intermediate-advanced yogis, I think this is an excellent dvd for those days where you feel a burst of energy.  The only hang up I have with the dvd is that it's 60+ minutes and hard to customize for those days where you just don't feel like doing 60+ minutes of yoga.

1022294,A1YWNBYIJDFXMY,B000IU36R6,brm,"[0, 0]","This is basically a copy of the review I wrote for Shiva Rae's Prenatal Yoga video by giam. I purchased both videos early in my pregnancy.Shiva Rae's Prenatal Yoga: I have used this throughout my pregnancy. I have been practicing yoga for about 6 years, but stick with a relatively gentle practice. I haven't seriously progressed into the more vigorous or acrobatic asanas some folks do. In many ways, I'd say I still do a beginner's practice. With that said, I would suggest this video to a true beginner (out of shape, no experience with yoga) or to someone who wants to gear down to a more gentle routine for pregnancy.I also bought Complete Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & Short Forms 2 DVD Set by Jennifer Wolfe and have used it a couple of times. There is a lot I like about that video but it is a little too intense for my personal taste. Also, I don't like the way it is shot. Many times, the videographer does these close-ups on the faces of the models, not sure what the purpose of that is. It's not a big deal at all really, but I notice these details every time and it just bugs me. Overall I prefer the Shiva Rea video and, if I recall correctly, it was significantly cheaper when I bought it. So another reason to go with Prenatal Yoga by Shiva Rea.",4,"Good, but not my favorite",1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,1255,"['basically', 'copy', 'review', 'wrote', 'Shiva', 'Rae', 'Prenatal', 'Yoga', 'video', 'giam', 'purchased', 'videos', 'early', 'pregnancy.Shiva', 'Rae', 'Prenatal', 'Yoga', 'have', 'used', 'pregnancy', 'have', 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', '6', 'years', 'stick', 'relatively', 'gentle', 'practice', 'have', ""n't"", 'seriously', 'progressed', 'more', 'vigorous', 'acrobatic', 'asanas', 'folks', 'do', 'many', 'ways', ""'d"", 'say', 'still', 'do', 'beginner', 'practice', 'said', 'would', 'suggest', 'video', 'true', 'beginner', 'shape', 'experience', 'yoga', 'someone', 'who', 'gear', 'down', 'more', 'gentle', 'routine', 'pregnancy.I', 'also', 'bought', 'Complete', 'Prenatal', 'Vinyasa', 'Yoga', 'Short', 'Forms', '2', 'DVD', 'Set', 'Jennifer', 'Wolfe', 'have', 'used', 'couple', 'times', 'lot', 'like', 'video', 'little', 'too', 'intense', 'personal', 'taste', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'shot', 'Many', 'times', 'videographer', 'close-ups', 'models', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'purpose', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'really', 'notice', 'details', 'time', 'just', 'bugs', 'Overall', 'prefer', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'video', 'recall', 'correctly', 'was', 'significantly', 'cheaper', 'when', 'bought', 'So', 'reason', 'go', 'Prenatal', 'Yoga', 'Shiva', 'Rea']",N/A

I started doing them in my second trimester and am still doing them close to the end here (though heartburn doesn't allow for too much downward dog). My strength, stamina and flexibility improved noticably just from these DVDs. I was encouraged by the strength and flexibility of the models to push myself a little further each time. And this sounds cheezy but Jennifer Wolfe is so warm and gentle that it feels like you are doing the yoga with a friend rather than an instructor.I really enjoyed being able to choose between 30, 45 or 75min practices (I rarely did the 15min one because I wanted something longer, but it's good too) - and I like that the practices are different from one another. There are ample modifications for different stages of pregnancy.I guess the only warning about these DVDs is be prepared to do a lot of lunges and downward dogs (part of vinyasa yoga) - I made the mistake of doing the 75 min practice on hardwood with only my yoga mat and my knees were sore from touching the ground so much. Then I moved to carpet, with a folded towel to place my knees on and it was much better.I wish Jennifer Wolfe did more regular yoga DVDs, but I will certainly keep this prenatal DVD to use after the baby is born as well..",5,Love these DVDs!,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,1278,"['am', 'so', 'happy', 'got', 'DVD', 'set', 'started', 'doing', 'second', 'trimester', 'am', 'still', 'doing', 'close', 'end', 'here', 'heartburn', ""n't"", 'allow', 'too', 'much', 'downward', 'dog', 'strength', 'stamina', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'noticably', 'just', 'DVDs', 'was', 'encouraged', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'models', 'push', 'little', 'further', 'time', 'cheezy', 'Jennifer', 'Wolfe', 'so', 'warm', 'gentle', 'are', 'doing', 'yoga', 'friend', 'rather', 'instructor.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'able', 'choose', '30', '45', '75min', 'practices', 'rarely', 'did', '15min', 'one', 'wanted', 'something', 'longer', 'good', 'too', 'like', 'practices', 'are', 'different', 'one', 'are', 'ample', 'modifications', 'different', 'stages', 'pregnancy.I', 'guess', 'only', 'warning', 'DVDs', 'be', 'prepared', 'do', 'lot', 'lunges', 'downward', 'dogs', 'part', 'vinyasa', 'yoga', 'made', 'mistake', 'doing', '75', 'min', 'practice', 'hardwood', 'only', 'yoga', 'mat', 'knees', 'were', 'sore', 'touching', 'ground', 'so', 'much', 'Then', 'moved', 'carpet', 'folded', 'towel', 'place', 'knees', 'was', 'much', 'wish', 'Jennifer', 'Wolfe', 'did', 'more', 'regular', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'will', 'certainly', 'keep', 'prenatal', 'DVD', 'use', 'baby', 'born', 'well..']",N/A

Further, you also spend a LOT of time upside down, specifically in downward dog.For someone claiming to be a doula and to have all this experience working with pregnant women, she should know that all being upside down accomplishes is having baby crammed into your lungs. That is not especially conducive to breathing. Further, she doesn't give you time to get INTO a new pose. When a woman is in her 3rd trimester, there is no zipping through the forms the way she does.One time she had a 3rd trimester woman adjust a form for a lunge by dropping her knee. Er...that's not a complicated pose even in 3rd trimester.

Laura ""quasilaur""","[1, 1]","The back of the DVD, as well as a majority of the Amazon reviews state that this video is for people who have been practicing yoga for awhile, and are familiar with more strenuous yoga.  I considered myself more in that category than I probably should have.  I've been doing prenatal yoga in a Power Vinyasa studio for a month now, and have been practicing using Rainbeau Mar's ZenMama and Anna Getty's Pre and Post-Natal Work out for twice a week, for six months.  I thought this would be enough, but not enough for Jennifer Wolfe's video.The reflux I've been experiencing as I've neared my third trimester DEFINITELY flared up during practice, and if it hadn't been for padding my knees (something I've been doing through my classes and videos), I don't know how I could have got through as far as I did (1 hr mark.)  Unlike my first experiences with the studio classes, and other previously mentioned videos, I felt my first time with this video feeling hurried, out of sync, uncomfortable (reflux) and overwhelmed.  Maybe it's just being pregnant, but I expect a little pampering with my practice during this time, which is something that Anna Getty and Rainbeau Mars communicate very well through their videos, and Jennifer Wolfe does not.If this video interests you, and you're fit and well practiced, then know that this is not a well produced video, and it's not simple to just skip straight to the practice at the exact point you want.  Also, if you need more visual cues (or are more practiced with the asana names to clue you in), these are few and far between, and the camera angle isn't always good at showing the appropriate alignment (and there is little verbal coaching as to what you should be feeling to clue you in and self-adjust.)  There is a lot of repetition, so if you're more practiced in Ashtanga, this might be up your alley.

1022308,A1JRCHGCZVE3CV,B000IU36R6,RunningMomma,"[3, 3]","Let me start by saying the 75 minute routine is a really great workout.  It makes me feel like I'm getting the same level of workout I would be getting from my non-prenatal yoga dvds.  I feel great afterwards and don't worry about injuries during.  That being said, it's hard to find the motivation to do a workout that long.  This is my second pregnancy, and my two year old daughter doesn't nap long enough for me to get this and the other things around the house done.  But, I would still recommend it, just because it's hard to find prenatal exercise dvds that don't treat you like you're incapable of truly working out.  The instructor is slightly annoying, too.  She seems to be trying too hard to be calming and talks way too slow sometimes.  But, again it's something I can overlook.  This comes with another dvd called Short Forms, with three other routines on it.  They are 15 minutes long, 30 minutes, and 45 minutes.  I've only tried the 30 minute and 45 minute ones.  The problem I have with these is I expected the level of difficulty to be the same, just shorter.  That's not the case.  They are a little easier, but you can take what you've learned from the 75 minute routine and make them a bit more difficult.  This would have been a perfect dvd if the instructor could have shortened the 75 minute routine some, maybe by going through the modifications faster and cutting out a few things.  But, still give it a try if you want a solid, challenging yoga workout.**Update** Now that I am well into my third trimester (35 weeks), I am appreciating the shorter routines much more.  I do the 45 minute one the most and am glad she included these.  I like that this DVD transitions well with you throughout the entire pregnancy and would still highly recommend it!",4,"Love the routine, not the length",1350950400,"10 23, 2012",2012,1778,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', '75', 'minute', 'routine', 'really', 'great', 'workout', 'feel', ""'m"", 'getting', 'same', 'level', 'workout', 'would', 'be', 'getting', 'non-prenatal', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'feel', 'great', 'afterwards', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'injuries', 'being', 'said', 'hard', 'find', 'motivation', 'do', 'workout', 'long', 'second', 'pregnancy', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'nap', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'other', 'things', 'house', 'done', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'just', 'hard', 'find', 'prenatal', 'exercise', 'dvds', 'do', ""n't"", 'treat', ""'re"", 'incapable', 'truly', 'working', 'out', 'instructor', 'slightly', 'annoying', 'too', 'be', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'calming', 'talks', 'way', 'too', 'slow', 'sometimes', 'again', 'something', 'can', 'overlook', 'dvd', 'called', 'Short', 'Forms', 'three', 'other', 'routines', 'are', '15', 'minutes', 'long', '30', 'minutes', '45', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'only', 'tried', '30', 'minute', '45', 'minute', 'ones', 'problem', 'have', 'expected', 'level', 'difficulty', 'be', 'same', 'just', 'shorter', 'not', 'case', 'are', 'little', 'easier', 'can', 'take', 'what', ""'ve"", 'learned', '75', 'minute', 'routine', 'make', 'bit', 'more', 'difficult', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'dvd', 'instructor', 'could', 'have', 'shortened', '75', 'minute', 'routine', 'maybe', 'going', 'modifications', 'faster', 'cutting', 'out', 'few', 'things', 'still', 'give', 'try', 'want', 'solid', 'challenging', 'yoga', 'workout', '**Update**', 'Now', 'am', 'well', 'third', 'trimester', '35', 'weeks', 'am', 'appreciating', 'shorter', 'routines', 'much', 'more', 'do', '45', 'minute', 'one', 'most', 'am', 'glad', 'included', 'like', 'DVD', 'transitions', 'well', 'entire', 'pregnancy', 'would', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
