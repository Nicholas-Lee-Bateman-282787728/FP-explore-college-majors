Somewhere in the history and mystery of Houston, Texas there is this fellow, who alone and with companions has made a large body of some of the most willfully uncommercial and purely personal music ever recorded. He's only spoken to a couple people in his career (I'm one of them), and only done one interview, but has become a legend and inspired a couple tribute albums and this very watchable and respectful film. This successfully captures the singular Jandek vibe, as it unfolds like the mystery story that it ultimately is. Despite my admitted lack of objectivity, I found this one of the rare music related films that worked as a film, as well as it did an exploration of the artist.",5,Jandek on Corwood,1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,804,"['get', 'see', 'invisible', 'man', 'emerge', 'way', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'glimpsed', 'seen', 'spoken', 'Somewhere', 'history', 'mystery', 'Houston', 'Texas', 'fellow', 'who', 'alone', 'companions', 'made', 'large', 'body', 'most', 'willfully', 'uncommercial', 'purely', 'personal', 'music', 'ever', 'recorded', 'only', 'spoken', 'couple', 'people', 'career', ""'m"", 'one', 'only', 'done', 'one', 'interview', 'become', 'legend', 'inspired', 'couple', 'tribute', 'albums', 'very', 'watchable', 'respectful', 'film', 'successfully', 'singular', 'Jandek', 'vibe', 'mystery', 'story', 'ultimately', 'admitted', 'lack', 'objectivity', 'found', 'one', 'rare', 'music', 'related', 'films', 'worked', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'exploration', 'artist']",N/A
865669,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,B0006FGHDS,Guy De Federicis,"[2, 3]","Documentary attempts to lift the veil on mysterious, unknown musician, Jandek, who has been steadily producing and distributing his own beatnik meets acid freak music for decades. The only evidence of his identity is a P.O. Box scribed on his self-owned, crudely generic record label, Corwood Records. The film mirrors Jandek's successful self promotion, be it genius or simply sincere, by painting an eerie, enticing picture while infatuated talking heads, (record geeks, rock and roll writers, and a reserved, trustworthy, radio icon, Dr. Demento), speculate on his identity and music. The genuinely creepy, yet hollow and mundane images of Jandek and his environment, from his K-Mart Photo Booth-like album covers, along with the strange stream of unconsciousness music, (definitely an acquired taste, like drinking gasoline is an acquired taste), creates an undeniably frightening unknown. The payoff is a telephone interview in which Jandek reveals himself as a normal, yet private and protective guy, whose dumbfounded silence, when asked a simple question, (a very funny scene), is indicative to the limits of his playful madness. This documentary has pushed this admirable artist, who you become fond of as you watch the film, into the mainstream.

The bulk of the movie is interviews with music critics, but a surprise telephone interview with the eccentric and reclusive artist at the film's end answers some crucial questions.

By continuing to make music since 1978 to the present day, without allowing the outside world to know anything at all about him, Jandek creates his own mystery, his own story by allowing others to project themselves on to him.  Add to that the rabid, adjective addicted, Lester Bangs 2nd generation of music critics who opine for anything to mythologize ... and you have a rock legend.  The documentary gives you as much Jandek as you could can have, which is not very much.  The entertainment is to be found in the lack of information, which merely encourages everyone to spin wild theories about Jandek.  The more insane he is (he must be, right) the better.  The documentary is also an example of negative space, because very few actual facts are presented.  It asks one question:  is art intention or interpretation?

865673,A36OGGJQKZ4SGI,B0006FGHDS,"matthewslaughter ""matthewslaughter""","[17, 19]","For those of you who don't know, Jandek is an atonal folk-musician based out of Houston, Texas.  He has released 38 albums (to date) since ""Ready for the House"" (credited to The Units) was released in 1978.  Despite this prolific output, he has only conducted one formal interview, has not allowed any photographs to be taken of him aside from those that appear on his album covers, and has never performed live [see note at end of review].  His music is very far from being accessible, so most people are not likely to be interested in this musical enigma.  But for those who are, this documentary sheds some light--but mainly speculates--on the artist, his intentions, his neuroses, his lyrics and his music.This documentary features of series of interviews with music critics who have reviewed his work, praised his work, and contains interviews with the few people who have actually come into personal contact with Jandek.  The most noteworthy inclusion on the DVD is the full-length interview--the only one Jandek has ever allowed--granted to a writer in 1985.Much of the commentary by the critics here is interesting, noting the fascination a small but devoted base of fans has to his recordings.  That being said, the flow of the documentary is quite lethargic at times, especially in the last half-hour (where it seems as if the film is wrapping up continually, even though there is still 30 minutes left), where many of the facts and assessments of Jandek's life and work are recapitulated with somnolent precision.  Also, many critics speculate on his potential insanity, which is just sheer sensationalism.  It's clear from his output and his media (or, lack thereof) representation that he is a very calculating artist who has shrewdly created a fascinating persona ... if he is crazy, he's crazy like a fox.The bonus features include excerpts from his last five albums.  [Note: Jandek broke his hermitage and performed a concert at the Instal.04 Festival in Glasgow on October 17, 2004.  According to Seth Tisue's Jandek website, the initial reaction was one of disappointment, but that is probably owing to ridiculously high expectations.]",3,The Mystery is One Step Closer to Being Solved,1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,2153,"['who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Jandek', 'atonal', 'folk-musician', 'based', 'Houston', 'Texas', 'released', '38', 'albums', 'date', 'Ready', 'House', 'credited', 'Units', 'was', 'released', '1978', 'prolific', 'output', 'only', 'conducted', 'one', 'formal', 'interview', 'not', 'allowed', 'photographs', 'be', 'taken', 'aside', 'appear', 'album', 'never', 'performed', 'live', '[', 'see', 'note', 'end', 'review', ']', 'music', 'very', 'far', 'being', 'accessible', 'so', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'interested', 'musical', 'enigma', 'who', 'are', 'documentary', 'light', 'mainly', 'artist', 'intentions', 'neuroses', 'lyrics', 'music.This', 'documentary', 'features', 'series', 'interviews', 'music', 'critics', 'who', 'have', 'reviewed', 'work', 'praised', 'work', 'interviews', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'actually', 'come', 'personal', 'contact', 'Jandek', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'inclusion', 'DVD', 'full-length', 'interview', 'only', 'one', 'Jandek', 'ever', 'allowed', 'granted', 'writer', '1985.Much', 'commentary', 'critics', 'here', 'interesting', 'noting', 'fascination', 'small', 'devoted', 'base', 'fans', 'recordings', 'being', 'said', 'flow', 'documentary', 'quite', 'lethargic', 'times', 'especially', 'last', 'half-hour', 'where', 'film', 'wrapping', 'up', 'continually', 'even', 'still', '30', 'minutes', 'left', 'where', 'many', 'facts', 'assessments', 'Jandek', 'life', 'work', 'are', 'recapitulated', 'somnolent', 'precision', 'Also', 'many', 'critics', 'speculate', 'potential', 'insanity', 'just', 'sheer', 'sensationalism', 'clear', 'output', 'media', 'lack', 'thereof', 'representation', 'very', 'calculating', 'artist', 'who', 'shrewdly', 'created', 'fascinating', 'persona', 'crazy', 'crazy', 'fox.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'excerpts', 'last', 'five', 'albums', '[', 'Note', 'Jandek', 'broke', 'hermitage', 'performed', 'concert', 'Instal.04', 'Festival', 'Glasgow', 'October', '17', '2004', 'According', 'Seth', 'Tisue', 'Jandek', 'website', 'initial', 'reaction', 'was', 'one', 'disappointment', 'probably', 'owing', 'ridiculously', 'high', 'expectations', ']']",N/A
