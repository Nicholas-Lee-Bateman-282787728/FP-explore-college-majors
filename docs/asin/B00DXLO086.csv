1662196,A2XJAMHZL2QHP8,B00DXLO086,80's TV Fan,"[6, 10]","Everyone knows what a classic this show is...so on to the DVD product itself...The video quality of the masters are just okay.  They did not remaster new transfers from film so some analog tape noise is apparent as the seasons go on.  Here's hoping they will give the series the special attention it deserves on Blu-Ray one day.  They also used the wrong theme orchestration and animation for the Main Title of the Black and White seasons.There are tons of vintage special features that could have been included on the individual seasons if Sony wanted. The Bewitched Collector on youtube has demonstrated this.  Also, how is it Japan and the UK have a bonus disc that the US release could have included?  Sony just wants to make a quick buck with uninformed marketing execs who don't care about the product. CBS does it right more often for special vintage series like this.It's a shame Sony does not care about one of it's number one vintage TV assets. But I'm pretty sure they believe consumers will buy it anyway, in the bargain bin packaging that scratches the discs.  If you're the average consumer looking for a bargain then I am sure you will appreciate this set, but it will leave many Bewitched fans wishing it was better.http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bewitched-Seasons-1-8-Elizabeth-Montgomery/dp/B002LL16EU/ref=pd_cp_d_h__1",1,Five Star Show...ZERO star release.,1381881600,"10 16, 2013",2013,1329,"['Everyone', 'what', 'classic', 'show', 'so', 'DVD', 'product', 'video', 'quality', 'masters', 'are', 'just', 'okay', 'did', 'not', 'remaster', 'new', 'transfers', 'film', 'so', 'analog', 'tape', 'noise', 'apparent', 'seasons', 'go', 'Here', 'hoping', 'will', 'give', 'series', 'special', 'attention', 'Blu-Ray', 'one', 'day', 'also', 'used', 'wrong', 'theme', 'orchestration', 'animation', 'Main', 'Title', 'Black', 'White', 'are', 'tons', 'vintage', 'special', 'features', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'individual', 'seasons', 'Sony', 'wanted', 'Bewitched', 'Collector', 'youtube', 'demonstrated', 'Also', 'how', 'Japan', 'UK', 'have', 'bonus', 'disc', 'US', 'release', 'could', 'have', 'included', 'Sony', 'just', 'make', 'quick', 'buck', 'uninformed', 'marketing', 'execs', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'product', 'CBS', 'right', 'more', 'often', 'special', 'vintage', 'series', 'this.It', 'shame', 'Sony', 'not', 'care', 'one', 'number', 'one', 'vintage', 'TV', 'assets', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'believe', 'consumers', 'will', 'buy', 'anyway', 'bargain', 'bin', 'packaging', 'discs', ""'re"", 'average', 'consumer', 'looking', 'bargain', 'then', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'appreciate', 'set', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'Bewitched', 'fans', 'wishing', 'was', 'better.http', '//www.amazon.co.uk/Bewitched-Seasons-1-8-Elizabeth-Montgomery/dp/B002LL16EU/ref=pd_cp_d_h__1']",Bewitched: The Complete Series

The disks are labled oddly, with the disk count going through the whole series, and not starting over with each season. Also, only the first 2 season disks show which episodes are present on the disk.  Lastly, the packaging is just 2 vacuform stems, so, unless you are going to bingle-view the whole show, you are going to have to put a sack of previously watched disks somewhere.

1662227,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B00DXLO086,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[3, 21]","When interracial marriages was still making suburbia very upset--and was actually illegal in some parts of the nation- Hollywood figured out how to help soothe over the inevitable anxiety: Repackage it only as an attractive and smart blonde marrying an ad executive. And show that both sides of the family ultimately have some adjusting to do!The resulting scripts' ultimately stirred up a sure-fire 'potion' of comedy laughs for the ABC network. It also made Elizabeth Montgomery and her co-stars a success.Samantha objects to the ad portrayals of witches as ugly and deformed by McMann and Tate, Darrin's advertising company, in Season One of this series (""The Witches Are Out""). This advertising account pays the Stephens's bills for a nice home. They're able to live the American Dream which is still very important post-war. But the ad campaign stereotypes 'her people' and their culture. Samantha wants Darrin to think about what he is doing. Darrin is caught between the preferences of his client and requests of his relatives. What does he ultimately have to do??Because the Stephens are 'different' from most families. they have to use a 'witch doctor'. Dr. Hubert Bombay is summoned only by voice command from one of the Stephens (first showing up in Season Three ""There's Gold In Them Thar Pills""). He adores Samantha, but cannot figure out where Darrin successfully fits in. Darrin is 'strange' to the witches!!Even less professional is Endora, deliciously played by Agnes Morehead. She is the 'evil mother in law'. Never ever bothering to remember his correct name.Endora just calls poor Darrin by whatever pops into her head at the moment. Unlike Samantha, she occasionally attempts to use her powers for 'evil'--even initially trying to break up the romance. Having a mortal son-in-law is embarassing!!It is alluded to that she and Samantha's father Maurice (Maurice Evans) are either separated or have an open marriage by non-consent--itself shocking  in this `liberated era'. Endora is more openly the anti-housewife, she wants to travel the world and through time instead of cleanning the house and doing laundry. It shocks Endora that Samantha insead settles for 'this'! 'Samantha darling' could have so much more.Instead of `hating' Endora though--audiences are supposed to empathize with and feel pity. Rather than fully enjoying her independence, Endora obviously spends time picking apart what she cannot ever have. Being all powerful does not mean anything when you cannot control true love. Love is stronger than magic.Because she does want her daughter to be happy, Endora actually refrains from hurting Darrin, it is just good-natured teasing after all. She lets the two of them stay together. She might be envious of the happy marriage which the two of them have. This does become apparent when Endora uses magic to 'help' Darrin (""What Makes ""Darrin Run?""). She wouldn't have even lifted a finger if she did not actually feel something for his well-being.And like all grandmothers, Endora IS happy about having Tabitha--and then Adam. Because Endora wanted grandchildren to play with, she did not personally care that they are part-mortal. Darrin himself earlier mused about life with half-magical children in ""...And Something Makes Three"".  Being a parent would pose challenges, but moreso, when they came from two 'different' cultures. The Stephens would have to explain both mortal and witch culture to their children. Helping them learn to use powers and interact with people (from all backgrounds) are tackled in episodes.All of the comings and goings at 1164 Morning Glory Circle generate suspicion among the neighbors. Instead of neighborhood security or respect, Gladys Kravitz (Alice Pearce and Sandra Gould) got portrayed as a lonely old loon. Nobody else believes--or even likes what she is saying. A running gag throughout the series is her getting worked up by what 'other people' are doing.Apparently Abner Kravitz (George Tobias) doez has a crush on Samantha! He writes his own wife off as a hysterical busybody--especially when Gould later took over the role in 1966. This Mrs. Kravitz began calling the neighborhood police on Samantha and her relatives! Not the best way to go about making neighborhood friends.Mrs. Kravitz and Endora are both not powerful in their marriage. They have to preoccupy themselves with 'getting others' specifically because they are not content with their unions. This too is radical, challenging the notion that every marriage leads to perfect happiness. The series is different from earlier sitcoms, where every woman was content in the marriage--and did not desire anything else. Marriage can be dull for the people who want and need 'more' in their lives.The only relatives who openly like Darrin just for himself are 'Uncle Arthur' (Paul Lynde) and 'Aunt Clara' (Marion Lorne). They are the only members of Samantha's family who do not make fun of mortals. Darrin feels comfortable talking with them when they come to the house.This series ran between 1964-1972, so the special effects are obviously not up to today's computer-generated expectations. The plots still hold up very well. And they held up very well in their time especially considering what was on the other networks (ahem, Batman).  Or considering that Darrin suddenly looks 'different' midway through the series (Dick York left because of disability). Other lesser-quality series would have been damaged by these 'chips'. Bewitched was crafted very well from the start.All of the seasons are included, and for this release, all of the episodes are going to be in color. The first two seasons, if you either saw them originally or through reruns, were actually filmed and originally shown in black and white. Presenting them in color for the DVD release has caused a degree of dispute among us series fans if the release itself is 'authentic'. But I am convinced that the coloration is not taking anything away. Some things (like Endora's oulfit) can only be viewed accurately in full color because it's so trippy. This is one of the series which color TV was really designed for.The only flaw of this release is that there are no extras--like interviews or bloopers. Okay the fact that they were dealing with the analogy of 'interracial marriage' might not have lent itself to a lot of bloopers on the set. But maybe some interviews would have been nice.",4,A Neat Trick,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,6401,"['When', 'interracial', 'marriages', 'was', 'still', 'making', 'suburbia', 'very', 'upset', 'was',

You get every single ""Bewitched"" episode that aired on the ABC television network and the shows look wonderful as they were cleaned from the master tapes. However, what we don't get as fans are three episodes that were actually shot with one airing on ABC, but pulled out of the syndication package because of the story content. I for one was hoping that when the entire series was released in one DVD set those shows would finally make the light of day, but alas it wasn't to be so.Also troubling is the fact that there are no bonus features. What about some old interviews with the shows stars and producers and writers; what about some old ""Bewitched"" commercials?; what about a bit more effort in salvaging those lost shows?The packaging also is typical of Sony when they put a ""Complete Series"" on DVD: the DVD's are stacked on top of one another in two bundles, so be careful with them. Also, the first two seasons here are the colorized shows not the black and white ones, although they too can be purchased. Or you can do what I do...draw the color from your TV set and watch the first two years in black and white and save some money!Ohhh well, at least fans get a chance to enjoy the best sitcom ever with all its wonderful charm in one complete set.P.S...if you already own the individual season sets there is really no reason to purchase this, but if you don't own them this is a must-have!",5,"""MY FAVORITE SHOW OF ALL-TIME""",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,1542,"['many', 'years', 'Columbia', 'promising', 'Complete', 'Series', 'set', 'Bewitched', 'now', 'word', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'entirety', 'get', 'single', 'Bewitched', 'episode', 'aired', 'ABC', 'television', 'network', 'shows', 'look', 'wonderful', 'were', 'cleaned', 'master', 'tapes', 'However', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'fans', 'are', 'three', 'episodes', 'were', 'actually', 'shot', 'one', 'airing', 'ABC', 'pulled', 'out', 'syndication', 'package', 'story', 'content', 'one', 'was', 'hoping', 'when', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'released', 'one', 'DVD', 'set', 'shows', 'would', 'finally', 'make', 'light', 'day', 'was', ""n't"", 'be', 'so.Also', 'troubling', 'fact', 'are', 'bonus', 'What', 'old', 'interviews', 'shows', 'stars', 'producers', 'writers', 'what', 'old', 'Bewitched', 'commercials', 'what', 'bit', 'more', 'effort', 'salvaging', 'lost', 'shows', 'packaging', 'also', 'typical', 'Sony', 'when', 'put', 'Complete', 'Series', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'are', 'stacked', 'top', 'one', 'two', 'bundles', 'so', 'be', 'careful', 'Also', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'here', 'are', 'colorized', 'not', 'black', 'white', 'ones', 'too', 'can', 'be', 'purchased', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'draw', 'color', 'TV', 'set', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'years', 'black', 'white', 'save', 'money', 'Ohhh', 'well', 'least', 'fans', 'get', 'chance', 'enjoy', 'best', 'sitcom', 'ever', 'wonderful', 'charm', 'one', 'complete', 'set.P.S', 'already', 'own', 'individual', 'season', 'sets', 'really', 'reason', 'purchase', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'must-have']",Bewitched: The Complete Series

(Note: I saw 2 episodes (in black & white) on tv today & discovered tv had omitted 2 minor scenes in 2 episodes - obviously so tv could fit in more commercials).  I'm thrilled that I get to see the episodes in their entirety on this dvd set. Also that they colorized the first 2 seasons.  I usually am against colorization but they did such a fine job that it actually improves those black & white episodes. For fun, my husband & I watched an episode in Spanish with Spanish subtitles. Usually we just watch episodes in English with no subtitles. I think the packaging is as compact & nice as it can be, considering all 8 seasons are packed in it!  I remember Bewitched as a child but don't remember every episode. So glad I happened to see this at Costco. My husband rolled his eyes when I put it in shopping cart but now he's glad I got it.

One thing I never remembered... there were so many ginger haired (red headed) men in the show. I also noticed the baby had changed from red hair, to dark hair, as she was a newborn, in the 2nd season. I also noticed the inside house does not match the &#34;facade&#34; pictures during transitions. Where the den and the kitchen door meets in that hallway, we should not see a door with light coming through it. That is where the garage should be, so no light would come through it.

I also give tremendous credit to the studio that oversaw the colorization of the first two seasons, as they did a near-flawless job that could almost make you forget they used to be black and white. The only serious negative about this set is the way they chose to holster the DVDs in the packaging: basically, they're split into two stacks with the DVDs on top of each other. If you want a particular one, you have to pull all the ones you don't want out until you get to it. They couldn't have done it in a book format like the equally-thick Honeymooners Lost Episodes collection?Despite the money-saving shortcut on the box, this set is a must-own for any fan of the show.
