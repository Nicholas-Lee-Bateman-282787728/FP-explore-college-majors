I'm 42 and it's one of my favorite movies - filled with real humor, believable characters - the movie has a lot of heart and soul.As for the Willows in Winter, it is the exact opposite.  Empty humor, one dimensional characters, harsh voices on some, no heart and soul.  Loved the WinW book, but the movie is awful. My children always want to watch Wind in the Willows, but never request the Willows in Winter.  I think, I hope, someone will one day produce a wonderful movie for this sequel story, but this is not it.",1,Unappealing,1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,589,"['Wind', 'Willows', 'VHS', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'absolutely', 'great', ""'m"", '42', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'filled', 'real', 'humor', 'believable', 'characters', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'soul.As', 'Willows', 'Winter', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Empty', 'humor', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'harsh', 'voices', 'heart', 'soul', 'Loved', 'WinW', 'book', 'movie', 'awful', 'children', 'always', 'want', 'watch', 'Wind', 'Willows', 'never', 'request', 'Willows', 'Winter', 'think', 'hope', 'someone', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'produce', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'sequel', 'story', 'not']",The Willows in Winter VHS

Not that a talking rat is credible, but given this flight of fancy, we've come to expect (from the original) believable circumstances and reactions to them.Oh, we get a good helping of Mr. Toad, and he is in vintage form.  And we get a lot of Badger, and that works out OK.  But we are short-changed with Rattie, and Molie is just too helpless to believe.  Otter is back in his same cameo-type appearance, and his son Portly is a grown otter now, but is made to be incredibly feeble-minded.I just felt that there was a ton of potential for a sequel (and more there after) to ""The Wind in the Willows"".  There were many stories (and new characters) roaming the woods and riverside ... just waiting to be discovered ... but the movie makers here follow a fairly narrow path that comes to a dead-end.  They've left themselves no room to make another one.
