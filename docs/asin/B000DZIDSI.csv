The song list is great, keeping classics with the newer stuff. The music is always a five stars, and the mix was descent for a live show.However, the dvd is drawn out by unamusing interludes of behind the scenes childish mischief.  It's not funny nor original, and I feel rooked (and at some points actually sick to my stomach) for having that filler in there.  They needed to just keep to the onstage footage with more angles and crowd shots.  The bonus CD of the Santana Medley is a big let down as well.  It's only just over 6 minutes long, hardly worth the pressing.  But, it is a must have for type o negative followers.  So, in closing, see if you can get this for as cheap as possible, not more than 15 or 16 bucks please.

Many Type O fans have had this concert bootlegged for years, but none have had it in the amazing quality and presentation. I won't bother you with what they did play, but it was a set consisting of classics, however, due to copyrights and clearances, ""Back In the USSR"" and the ""Day Tripper"" medley were cut from this release, kinda stinks because they vow to never play the beatles medley live, the one time they do and they can't get the rights to include it. The concert features Behind the scenes footage during the concert, which is really funny, I think this if any will finally shed some light on the band's sense of humor which most fans seem to not even notice in the intense serious-ness of their music. The DVD also features an Interview with Juliya(formerly of Fuse TV) in which the band sit down to discuss the DVD, which kind of doesn't make sense, as well as discuss what really happened with Peter to bring upon the near 3 year silence, and it wasn't ""Heart Problems"" or a back Injury! The disc also includes a tasteful slideshow of pics of Type O from Chilhood through their teen years that goes by pretty fast and is kind of funny too see.

When I bought this DVD, I was excited to see them Live since I never seen them live. I was rather disappointed with the really awful sound quality and the front man vocal sounded like he needed to loosen up his vocal cords, but after a while, the sound got just a tad better but still, not fun to listen to at all. It was a boring concert with not many camera angles. There was many songs that I love that wasn't performed, but they did several songs I love, and others, I don't even know why they bother with some songs that isn't so great. I watched this DVD the first half of it and then later, watched the second half and that was it. I was finish with it. Being one of my favorite band, I was disappointed with this DVD.

963781,A17TZW64KMZQ3P,B000DZIDSI,Nadia555,"[0, 0]","Type O Negative never did make it to Australia, unfortunately, so this was my introduction to the live Type O experience. Live DVDs are usually unengaging, but the energy really transferred on this one. The musicianship and the vocals were passionate. All albums were represented, so as someone who favours the 'October Rust' material, I was well pleased, especially with 'Love You to Death' which was played during the encore. A sweat-drenched Peter throws his bottle into the crowd, and though he doesn't engage much with the audience, he does toss off a few wry lines. It's pure metal, and it really showcases the uniqueness of this amazing band.As for the extras; if you like Jackass, you'll love this. I loved the parts where Type O were involved, which is obviously what you want from the DVD. Peter's jokes whilst on the toilet are absolutely hilarious. However, I found myself fast-forwarding some of the random dudes -- what they have to do with Type O Negative, I'll never know -- yes it's mildly funny, and this IS entertainment and all, but unless YOU'RE drunk as hell while watching this DVD, the potty humour may grate on you. Humour was always a huge part of Type O Negative's music, but random 'white trash' antics? Not so much my thing.Overall, I totally enjoyed myself watching this DVD, so it gets a hearty recommendation from me.

Symphony For the Devil finds Pete Steele and co. giving a rollicking performance, dishing out many classics like ""Black No. 1"", ""My Girlfriend's Girlfriend"", ""Everything Dies"", ""Christian Woman"", and their cover of Neal Young's ""Cinnamon Girl"" in front of a loud and raucous croud.  While the performance itself is spectacular, the DVD features are a bit of a disappointment.  While I enjoy seeing my favorite bands screw around and crack jokes as much as the next fan, there could have been a substancial amount of more extras thrown in here.  Despite that though, there is a nice little bonus in the form of some classic Santana covers, and the fact that this is the first official Type O live DVD could mean that bigger and better things are coming in the future.
