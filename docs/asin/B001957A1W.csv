The journey has unexpected moments as well as being occasionally predictable but is overall enjoyable and has a satisfactory ending.The unexpected moments are sometimes really funny; especially the dance sequence by Christine, the bossy, controlling woman, played by Mich&egrave;le Laroque, who wants Jeff out of his apartment.The movie gets off to a rather slow start, but picks up the pace and eventually turns into a movie worth watching, at least once.",4,Quirky But Fun,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,630,"['hero', 'Jeff', 'architect', 'played', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'character', 'disgusts', 'frustrates', 'then', 'finally', 'volatile', 'way', 'viewer', '8217', 's', 'heart', 'journey', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'occasionally', 'predictable', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'satisfactory', 'ending.The', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'are', 'sometimes', 'really', 'funny', 'especially', 'dance', 'sequence', 'Christine', 'bossy', 'controlling', 'woman', 'played', 'Mich', 'egrave', 'Laroque', 'who', 'Jeff', 'apartment.The', 'movie', 'off', 'rather', 'slow', 'start', 'up', 'pace', 'eventually', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once']",The Neighbor

1161353,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B001957A1W,MadMacs,"[1, 3]","Do I think older women can be sexy and appealing? Yes, I do!Classic example is Sally Field who is currently 64 years young and still delicious. No joke, she is incredibly sexy, at least to me.But would I pair her with Robert Pattinson in a romantic comedy? C'mon, seriously?And for the exact same reason I can't imagine a romantic scene between Wilford Brimley and Scarlett Johannsen. Yikes.This isn't age bigotry - it's age appropriateness, or lack thereof.No, this was a genuinely fine screenplay completely and totally ruined by yet another unfortunate choice of a 47-year old lead actress trying to play a 30-something. Do I get that Modine was actually a year older than her in real life? Absolutely. But Matt plays younger and his looks have seriously stabilized since at least the mid-90s; surgery perhaps, but he literally looks and plays like a man in his late 30s. Sadly Ms. Michele Laroque cannot say the same. Sorry cougars you can't win them all.What I truly wish the filmmakers would have recognized was how good this film could have been had they chosen Ann Cusack for the lead. Remember her? She played the best friend. Ann happens to be one of my favorite character actors and she really should've been given a well-deserved chance to take the lead. This flick would've resounded with a truth and energy that ... well.... what's done is done. Could've, would've, should've. So sad, because I could see this as an amazing film with her in the lead role.I would categorize this as a pass unless there's absolutely nothing left to watch - scraping the bottom of the rental barrel as it were.",2,"Ann Cusack - Could've, Would've, Should've",1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,1605,"['Do', 'think', 'older', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'sexy', 'appealing', 'Yes', 'do', 'Classic', 'example', 'Sally', 'Field', 'who', 'currently', '64', 'years', 'young', 'still', 'delicious', 'joke', 'incredibly', 'sexy', 'least', 'me.But', 'would', 'pair', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""C'mon"", 'seriously', 'exact', 'same', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'romantic', 'scene', 'Wilford', 'Brimley', 'Scarlett', 'Johannsen', 'Yikes.This', ""n't"", 'age', 'bigotry', 'age', 'appropriateness', 'lack', 'thereof.No', 'was', 'genuinely', 'fine', 'screenplay', 'completely', 'totally', 'ruined', 'yet', 'unfortunate', 'choice', '47-year', 'old', 'lead', 'actress', 'trying', 'play', '30-something', 'Do', 'get', 'Modine', 'was', 'actually', 'year', 'older', 'real', 'life', 'Absolutely', 'Matt', 'younger', 'looks', 'have', 'seriously', 'stabilized', 'least', 'mid-90s', 'surgery', 'perhaps', 'literally', 'man', 'late', '30s', 'Sadly', 'Ms.', 'Michele', 'Laroque', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'same', 'Sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'all.What', 'truly', 'wish', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'have', 'recognized', 'was', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'chosen', 'Ann', 'Cusack', 'lead', 'Remember', 'played', 'best', 'friend', 'Ann', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'character', 'actors', 'really', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'well-deserved', 'chance', 'take', 'lead', 'flick', 'would', ""'ve"", 'resounded', 'truth', 'energy', 'well', 'what', 'done', 'done', 'Could', ""'ve"", 'would', ""'ve"", 'should', ""'ve"", 'So', 'sad', 'could', 'see', 'amazing', 'film', 'lead', 'role.I', 'would', 'categorize', 'pass', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'left', 'watch', 'scraping', 'bottom', 'rental', 'barrel', 'were']",The Neighbor

I was previously unfamiliar with the acting of Michelle Laroque and she's obviously a very good actress as you see how Christine, the character she portrays, matures and blossoms once she slows down and gets some insight into her neighbor Jeff. Matthew Modine is a combination of funny, charming and somewhat eccentric in his role.  I don't like to delve into plots very much when I write a review, as I don't like to spoil things for someone who hasn't seen the film yet.

1161355,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B001957A1W,mk,"[4, 4]","Ok, so not all romantic-comedies have to star the young, sexy stars.  How about some middle aged types?  Or older like Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.  This one exudes plenty of quirkiness, some slapstick, and the typical love-hate relationship.Matthew Modine plays a bohemian, artist-architect(he's actually a painter in real life), divorcee-dad, who just can't get over his ex.  A floor below him, lives a driven, french woman, business developer who wants him out so she can live in peace and add on to her place.He's a bit of a dork, unruly, irresponsible but passionate on principles.  She and her equally uptight fiance are major up and comers, organized and planned for every step of the future.  It becomes a battle of noncongruences between the neighbors in the worse and funniest ways.  That is until they realize how truly unhappy they both are in their separate, weird worlds.I like the actors- both in their late 40's; her fiance talks about having kids- better hurry up! If you like younger stars in RC's, seek another flick.  The story's fun, the ending satisfying.  I can live with middle age romances because, well, that's me!

[I like to save my 4 ratings for movies I strongly enjoy but they just miss the ""MUST see"" mark of a 5-rating.]This was interesting and basically enjoyable, though it follows the age old Harlequin Romance story formula (ie they hate each other, but due to living proximity are forced to interact - and somehow one day they discover they actually like each other...there's a spark of romance and possibility.)The lead female is not an actress I'm familiar with, but she was pretty good and I enjoyed her accent.  As far as other reviewers suggesting she was too old for the pairing to be reasonable - I would have to wonder how young she believes the male actors to be in this.  It was entirely age appropriate as far as her with the men - BUT, perhaps not for the fiancee's wanting/expecting her to have 3 kids as they'd be starting out late.  Doable, but I would've just crossed that out of the script I think. At any rate, it matters little.Overall it was pleasantly charming.
