But it is a pretty good movie. The characters border on stereotypical, the story is simple, and they don't touch too much on the prejudices of the times, but Newman puts in a good performance, making worthy of watching (for Newman fans). And the ending is particularly well done, and a bit unexpected. It's the ending that makes the movie worth the price.As a dvd, Fox has created a failure. There are virtually no extras. There's a few behind the scenes stills and trailers for this movie, and a few of Newman's other films, but no commentary, documentary, or anything.If you already have it on VHS, don't worry about buying the dvd.

He must travel by the last stage coach out of town. Naturedly we are introduces to each of his traveling companions and given the general background of their life stories. We have the standard mix of exadurated stereotypes.You guessed it the stage is held up. Luckily for the other passengers John Russell, also know as Hombre was raised by the Indians. He is cool, calm, and decisive. The others are just a tad too pansy for reality. However it makes for a good story as they start to learn or not from John what it takes to survive. What they do not realize before it is too late is that John is doing more than just surviving. What on the surface seems like John is changing his ways in reality is an extension of what he was always about.Classic tale with no surprises. But well told and well acted. There are plenty of ""one liner's"", quasi philosophy, and a fair amount of gun play. In all a very satisfying movie.

224632,A3LVZY2B1TJB5D,630024685X,Charles Lewis,"[0, 0]","Based on the Elmore Leonard novel of the same name, ""Hombre"" remains an example of one of the better westerns of the mid-late 1960s and for the most part holds up very well. Indeed I am puzzled by some of the other reviews here on Amazon that rate it far below what it's worth. I think some people forget that any film is a product of the time its made in and the audience its produced for.Filmed on location in Southern Arizona (including the now long since vanished Helvetia mine in Pima County), ""Hombre"" is a great example of tight storytelling and good dialog. The pacing in the film is well done, no doubt in part to the abilities of editor Frank Bracht, and a decent script.Holding mostly true to the novel (with some key differences) ""Hombre"" tackles a few social issues which probably felt more relevant in the upheavals of the 1960s. Most of the film though tells a fairly straight forward tale of a gunfighter caught between two worlds while defending stagecoach passengers from an outlaw gang led by a superb Richard Boone. Boone's appearance in this film should be interesting to Elmore Leonard fans as he played a similar character in ""The Tall T"" with Randolph Scott, a film also based on a Leonard story.Backing up Newman and Boone is a fine roster of supporting players including Martin Balsam and Frederick March. Newman's performance of a white man raised by Apaches is understandably not his best remembered role, but he performs it ably. Frank Silvera is great as an unnamed Mexican bandit who has some of the best dialog in the movie.While modern viewers should remember the context and times in which the movie was made, and not expect a lot of fast paced gimmicks, ""Hombre"" is indeed a classic and one of the best westerns of the 1960s.",5,One of the finest Westerns of the 1960s,1365120000,"04 5, 2013",2013,1760,"['Based', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Hombre', 'example', 'one', 'better', 'westerns', 'mid-late', '1960s', 'most', 'part', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'Indeed', 'am', 'puzzled', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'rate', 'far', 'what', 'worth', 'think', 'people', 'forget', 'film', 'product', 'time', 'made', 'audience', 'produced', 'for.Filmed', 'location', 'Southern', 'Arizona', 'including', 'now', 'long', 'vanished', 'Helvetia', 'mine', 'Pima', 'County', 'Hombre', 'great', 'example', 'tight', 'storytelling', 'good', 'dialog', 'pacing', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'doubt', 'part', 'abilities', 'editor', 'Frank', 'Bracht', 'decent', 'script.Holding', 'mostly', 'true', 'novel', 'key', 'differences', 'Hombre', 'few', 'social', 'issues', 'probably', 'felt', 'more', 'relevant', 'upheavals', '1960s', 'Most', 'film', 'tells', 'fairly', 'straight', 'forward', 'tale', 'gunfighter', 'caught', 'two', 'worlds', 'defending', 'stagecoach', 'passengers', 'outlaw', 'gang', 'led', 'superb', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'Boone', 'appearance', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'interesting', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'fans', 'played', 'similar', 'character', 'Tall', 'T', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'film', 'also', 'based', 'Leonard', 'story.Backing', 'up', 'Newman', 'Boone', 'fine', 'roster', 'supporting', 'players', 'including', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'Frederick', 'March', 'Newman', 'performance', 'white', 'man', 'raised', 'Apaches', 'understandably', 'not', 'best', 'remembered', 'role', 'ably', 'Frank', 'Silvera', 'great', 'unnamed', 'Mexican', 'bandit', 'who', 'best', 'dialog', 'movie.While', 'modern', 'viewers', 'should', 'remember', 'context', 'times', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'not', 'expect', 'lot', 'fast', 'paced', 'gimmicks', 'Hombre', 'indeed', 'classic', 'one', 'best', 'westerns', '1960s']",N/A

224637,AUHG8KSHI529U,630024685X,Craig Matteson,"[5, 7]","In the mid to late sixties the Western was running out of steam and one of the popular fashions of the time was to invert the traditional storyline of the Indians being the bad guys and the Settlers (read Whites) being the good guys.  Now, in reality, most of the better Westerns weren't that crude or binary, but it was the accepted shorthand for the genre.  This movie is a pretty darn good example of the inverted type.  However, given Paul Newman's especially blue eyes it is hard to accept him as the Indian.  So, what they did was make him a White man raised among the Indians and who views himself and is viewed by others as if he were an actual Indian.This is a story of racism, greed, lust, betrayal, vengeance, rivalry, violence, and cruelty.  You know, all the cheerful and happy stuff of life.  And the bad guys in this movie are terrific.  Fredric March is supposedly a pillar of society and is shown to be more of a moral swamp.  Richard Boone is honest in his villainy and brightens the movie in his confrontations.  He really expects to have little trouble in getting what he is after and is frustrated by this strange hombre (he doesn't know Newman's character's name, John Russell, for most of the movie).The movie isn't happy with one or two bad guys.  It takes every character and strips them bare until the core of who they really are shows through.  At least, what the fashionable fiction writing of the 1960s believed was at the core of each of us shines through.The final confrontation is pretty grim, but heroic in its way.  There is lots of good dialogue, but even better acting.  Much of the film is done with facial expressions and we have to pay attention with our eyes to understand what is really going on with each of the characters.I recommend this movie.  It is very worthwhile to watch, if a bit grim.  And it is a nice piece to remind us of the social politics of the 1960s.  And, what the heck, it shows Paul Newman in his prime.  Plus, it has Richard Boone and a bunch of other fine performances!",5,A very good movie.

The story that follows centers on a variety of stage passengers of different backgroundds including the stereotyped corrupt but well to do Indian agent and his high maintenance wife who are caught in a stage hold up with the stoic Newman who is returning, at least for the moment, into the ""white"" world. Richard Boone (Paladin, Hec Ramsey)plays a broad and loud leader of a gang of outlaws who rob, then strands the passengers and due to a turn of events,  then hunts them down.  An appropriately sympathetic view of reservation life and the impact of corrupt officials. Diane Cilento shines as the moral conscious  but tough Jesse who is often in conflict with  Newman's pragmaticism as noted in the dialogue below:Jessie (Diane Cilento): That soldier would have helped you and you know it.John Russell (Paul Newman): I didn't ask for any.Jessie: He didn't even have a gun.John Russell: That's his business he don't wanna carry one.Jessie: It takes a lot to light a fire under you, doesn't it.John Russell: If it's alright with you, lady, I just didn't feel like bleeding for him.

A suspenseful Western with a social consciousness rarely found in films of that era, ""Hombre"" scored with a solid cast of pros, with Newman in his best Western role ever even over ""Butch Cassidy"" or ""The Left-Handed Gun"". Though he plays a stoical character who was raised by the Indians, his John Russell finally reveals himself in the end to be a man of compassion even over his apparent hatred of the White man when he takes action to save a white woman who professed prejudice over the Indians and humiliated him in an earlier scene.

It seems to me several of his westerns -- 3:10 to Yuma, Valdez is Coming and Joe Kidd, are really pretty good. Perhaps best of all from this period may be the 1967 film of his novel Hombre which is a taut and timeless character Western.The picture starts out with raised-by-Apaches white man John Russell, played by Paul Newman, returning to ""civilization"" in order to settle accounts when his wealthy benefactor has died. Paul's decked out in a long black wig and en route he sucker-punches David Canary in a rundown cantina where Canary is humiliating some native Americans. Once he's settled business in town, and newly shorn, Paul promptly leaves. To do that he must ride out on a special stage run by Martin Balsam and commissioned for prominent Indian affairs government figure Fredric March and his high-class wife Barbara Rush. Also waiting to catch the stage is the earthy, boarding-housekeeper played by Diane Cilento (Mrs. Sean Connery at the time) who Newman has put out of work when he sold her house.Into the station walks Richard Boone and one close-up is pretty much all you need to read malevolence in his every thought and gesture. He's heading out of town as well, and starts to bully Newman to give up his seat. When a nice-guy soldier sticks up for Paul, Boone turns his attention on him, and through sheer force of his brute affect, the soldier gives up his own ticket without a gun being pulled or a punch thrown. Paul just sits there, and we now know that he'll employ heroics to go to bat for the Apache, but he doesn't care any for the white man.The stage arrives and the second half of the story starts -- anything more would be a spoiler. But you're left wondering -- who are these two guys and what are they about? You can't imagine a greater pair of antagonists than Paul with his effortless ease and charm (even when he's being laconic) and Boone who is a big ugly sucker you can't take your eyes off. The others in the cast are also good -- especially legendary stage and screen star March and Cilento who shares some marvelously written exchanges with Newman that get at the heart of this Indian's beef with The Man.Even while the accent may be on characterization here, when the action starts you'll tax the edge of your seat. The climax is thrilling and topped off by a classic final line delivered by Balsam. I can't believe that Leonard had a problem with this picture. It's sensational.This Western deserves to be reconsidered as a classic -- it certainly stands up with some of Newman's best work from this period.",5,Native Newman,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,2707,"['Get', 'Shorty', 'ushered', 'golden', 'age', 'big', 'screen', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'adaptations', ""'d"", 'always', 'bemoaned', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'brought', 'stories', 'screen', 'several', 'westerns', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'Valdez', 'Coming', 'Joe', 'Kidd', 'are', 'really', 'pretty', 'good', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'period', 'may', 'be', '1967', 'film', 'novel', 'Hombre', 'taut', 'timeless', 'character', 'Western.The', 'picture', 'out', 'raised-by-Apaches', 'white', 'man', 'John', 'Russell', 'played', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'returning', 'civilization', 'order', 'settle', 'accounts', 'when', 'wealthy', 'benefactor', 'died', 'Paul', 'decked', 'out', 'long', 'black', 'wig', 'en', 'route', 'David', 'Canary', 'rundown', 'cantina', 'where', 'Canary', 'humiliating', 'native', 'Americans', 'settled', 'business', 'town', 'newly', 'shorn', 'Paul', 'promptly', 'do', 'must', 'ride', 'out', 'special', 'stage', 'run', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'commissioned', 'prominent', 'Indian', 'affairs', 'government', 'figure', 'Fredric', 'March', 'high-class', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'Rush', 'Also', 'waiting', 'catch', 'stage', 'earthy', 'boarding-housekeeper', 'played', 'Diane', 'Cilento', 'Mrs.', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'time', 'who', 'Newman', 'put', 'work', 'when', 'sold', 'house.Into', 'station', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'one', 'close-up', 'pretty', 'much', 'need', 'read', 'malevolence', 'thought', 'gesture', 'heading', 'town', 'as', 'well', 'bully', 'Newman', 'give', 'up', 'seat', 'When', 'nice-guy', 'soldier', 'up', 'Paul', 'Boone', 'attention', 'sheer', 'force', 'brute', 'affect', 'soldier', 'up', 'own', 'ticket', 'gun', 'being', 'pulled', 'punch', 'thrown', 'Paul', 'just', 'there', 'now', 'know', ""'ll"", 'employ', 'heroics', 'go', 'bat', 'Apache', ""n't"", 'care', 'white', 'man.The', 'stage', 'arrives', 'second', 'half', 'story', 'anything', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'who', 'are', 'two', 'guys', 'are', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'greater', 'pair', 'antagonists', 'Paul', 'effortless', 'ease', 'charm', 'even', 'when', 'being', 'laconic', 'Boone', 'who', 'big', 'ugly', 'sucker', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'off', 'others', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'especially', 'legendary', 'stage', 'screen', 'star', 'March', 'Cilento', 'who', 'shares', 'marvelously', 'written', 'exchanges', 'Newman', 'get', 'heart', 'Indian', 'beef', 'Man.Even', 'accent', 'may', 'be', 'characterization', 'here', 'when', 'action', ""'ll"", 'tax', 'edge', 'seat', 'climax', 'thrilling', 'topped', 'off', 'classic', 'final', 'line', 'delivered', 'Balsam', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Leonard', 'had', 'problem', 'picture', 'sensational.This', 'Western', 'deserves', 'be', 'reconsidered', 'classic', 'certainly', 'up', 'Newman', 'best', 'work', 'period']",N/A

Newman, at first, gives her the same animositythat he shows the others (except for his semi-friend,Martin Balsam, a Mexican). But Jessie has a lot of moxie,and Newman begins to respect her honesty, and her''I like to be with men'' feminist-fire. Eventually,he begins to have reciprocal feelings for her.At the end, he gets possession of the stolen money,and plans to return it to his tribe. He expects to killsome bad guys, and doesn't give a damn if the rest of thecaptives live or die.The others pressure Newman to exchange themoney in return for their freedom.Newman knows the bad guys won't free them if theyget the money, and so he warns the others, and callstheir bluff by offering to give the money to anyonewho wants to take the money, and give it to the badguys.No one steps forward -- except Jessie.Here she shows Newman her courage and willingnessto die if need be in order to help others.With all the anger/rage/animosity insidehim, Newman doesn't really give a damnif he lives or dies (I know this experientiallyas a VN vet) so instead, he goes down to meetthe outlaws after obtaining a pledge that the moneywill be returned  to his tribe.In the final analysis, he only wants the moneyreturned to his tribe, and Jessie not to be killed.As fate would have it, his back up shooterwasn't able to defend Newman, and sadly, we lose him.Fantastic story. The more I watch Paul Newmanmovies, the more I learn what a really great talenthe was (including his food charity).So if you are puzzled by some mean Hombre you know,and wonder why he hates everything and everybody,this flick is a great character study of such a man.Knowing that Paul Newman was a WW-2 combat veteranwhose unit was decimated, I can imagine how hefound the grit to make his character so believable.After watching the freebie on Amazon,I bought the DVD to add to my collection.",5,Excellent Western That Deals With Existential Themes,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,3305,"['Paul', 'Newman', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'captured', 'achild', 'raised', 'Apache', 'tribe.After', 'several', 'years', 'was', 'discovered', 'returnedto', 'Anglo', 'culture', 'time', 'was', 'adoptedby', 'family.His', 'escaped', 'Anglos', 'returned', 'tribe.The', 'movie', 'up', 'when', 'father', 'who', 'dies', 'boarding', 'house', 'agold', 'watch', 'western', 'town', 'HISTORICAL', 'NOTE', 'read', 'history', 'book', 'Anglo', 'children', 'takenby', 'Native', 'Americans', 'raised', 'own.The', 'author', 'book', 'found', 'historically', 'child', 'was', 'tribe', 'less', 'thana', 'year', 'two', 'then', 'returned', 'herfamily', 'child', 'would', 'stay', 'Anglos.But', 'child', 'had', 'been', 'tribe', 'morethan', 'couple', 'years', 'majority', 'would', 'makeattempts', 'return', 'native', 'tribes', 'Newman', 'town', 'boardinghouse', 'pack', 'horses', 'then', 'hisjourney', 'stagecoach', 'travel', 'townwhere', 'horses', 'are', 'located.During', 'journey', 'otherAnglos', 'Latinos', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly.Newman', 'festering', 'anger', 'hatred', 'towardthe', 'Anglos', 'US', 'government', 'what', 'didto', 'tribe', 'was', 'growing', 'up.Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'circled', 'question', 'why', 'end', 'anger', 'hatred', 'life', 'free', 'other', 'captives.Here', 'take', 'journey', 'Jessie', 'continually', 'tries', 'understand', 'love', 'withhim', 'Newman', 'first', 'same', 'others', 'semi-friend', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'Mexican', 'Jessie', 'lot', 'moxie', 'Newman', 'respect', 'honesty', 'like', 'be', 'men', 'feminist-fire', 'Eventually', 'have', 'reciprocal', 'feelings', 'her.At', 'end', 'possession', 'stolen', 'money', 'plans', 'return', 'tribe', 'killsome', 'bad', 'guys', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'rest', 'thecaptives', 'live', 'die.The', 'others', 'pressure', 'Newman', 'exchange', 'themoney', 'return', 'freedom.Newman', 'bad', 'guys', 'wo', ""n't"", 'free', 'theyget', 'money', 'so', 'others', 'callstheir', 'bluff', 'offering', 'give', 'money', 'anyonewho', 'take', 'money', 'give', 'badguys.No', 'one', 'forward', 'Jessie.Here', 'Newman', 'courage', 'willingnessto', 'die', 'need', 'be', 'order', 'help', 'others.With', 'anger/rage/animosity', 'insidehim', 'Newman', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'damnif', 'dies', 'know', 'VN', 'vet', 'so', 'instead', 'down', 'meetthe', 'outlaws', 'obtaining', 'pledge', 'moneywill', 'be', 'returned', 'tribe.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'only', 'moneyreturned', 'tribe', 'Jessie', 'not', 'be', 'killed.As', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'back', 'up', 'shooterwas', ""n't"", 'able', 'defend', 'Newman', 'sadly', 'lose', 'him.Fantastic', 'story', 'more', 'watch', 'Paul', 'Newmanmovies', 'more', 'learn', 'what', 'really', 'great', 'talenthe', 'was', 'including', 'food', 'charity', '.So', 'are', 'puzzled', 'mean', 'Hombre', 'know', 'wonder', 'why', 'everything', 'everybody', 'flick', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'man.Knowing', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'was', 'WW-2', 'combat', 'veteranwhose', 'unit', 'was', 'decimated', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'grit', 'make', 'character', 'so', 'believable.After', 'watching', 'freebie', 'Amazon', 'bought', 'DVD', 'add', 'collection']",N/A
224645,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,630024685X,Erik North,"[2, 5]","The 1960s were a transitional time for the Western genre.  Like every other film genre, it proved that it wasn't immune from the great political and social turbulence of that decade.  One of the best, but strangely also one of the most overlooked, is the 1967 film HOMBRE, which does a very good, if slightly cerebral job of delivering a ""message"" without heavy-handedness or preachiness.Based on one of Elmore Leonard's many novels, HOMBRE stars Paul Newman as John Russell, a white man abandoned by his parents as a child but raised by Apaches in Arizona who comes down from the reservation to ""rejoin"" white society.  His uncle, recently deceased, has left him a boarding house.  But despising the white man's treatment of the Apache (whom he feels much closer to), he instead rides out of town on a stagecoach captained by a Mexican driver (Martin Balsam).  During the journey through the Arizona desert, other people riding in the coach force him to ride on the outside with Balsam--another indication of the prejudice turned at him for being what he is.But when they are robbed by a gang of outlaws, led by Richard Boone (a superbly nasty heavy if ever there was one), the passengers, including an Indian agent (Frederic March), all realize that Newman may be their best and last chance for survival, especially since Boone has kidnapped March's wife (Barbara Rush).  The end result is a sort of cynical variation on John Ford's 1939 classic STAGECOACH (deliberate on the part of Leonard), where there are no true heroes in the end, only an understanding of the way people act and the way they expect to be treated.Filmed primarily on location in the desert around Tucson, Arizona, HOMBRE is a bit slower-paced than most people would like to see in a western, but it has more than enough good points to keep things interesting.  Newman delivers an incredibly low-key performance in which the disgust he feels inside for the white man's world is never expressed through shouting but a sort of cynical dialogue with people.  Diane Cilento is the woman who tries to get a bit of humanity out of the cynical half-breed; and Balsam, although some would say is miscast as a Mexican, gives a good enough performance as Newman's one link between his people and the white man.Martin Ritt, who had worked with Newman before on several films, notably the contemporary 1963 western HUD, directs with assured vigor, and James Wong Howe's widescreen cinematography, showing the barren Arizona landscape, is among the best ever done in the western genre, especially for the 1960s.  Although something of a ""message"" movie, HOMBRE's message is well in keeping with the decade in which it was made, and is never delivered in a hamfisted fashion.  It was an overlooked film in its day, but its recent restoration to DVD makes it an impressive piece well worth seeing.",4,Cynical 1960s Take On STAGECOACH,1129593600,"10 18, 2005",2005,2855,"['1960s', 'were', 'transitional', 'time', 'Western', 'genre', 'other', 'film', 'genre', 'proved', 'was', ""n't"", 'immune', 'great', 'political', 'social', 'turbulence', 'decade', 'One', 'best', 'strangely', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'overlooked', '1967', 'film', 'HOMBRE', 'very', 'good', 'slightly', 'cerebral', 'job', 'delivering', 'message', 'heavy-handedness', 'preachiness.Based', 'one', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'many', 'novels', 'HOMBRE', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'John', 'Russell', 'white', 'man', 'abandoned', 'parents', 'child', 'raised', 'Apaches', 'Arizona', 'who', 'down', 'reservation', 'rejoin', 'white', 'society', 'uncle', 'recently', 'deceased', 'left', 'boarding', 'house', 'despising', 'white', 'man', 'treatment', 'Apache', 'whom', 'much', 'closer', 'instead', 'town', 'stagecoach', 'captained', 'Mexican', 'driver', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'journey', 'Arizona', 'desert', 'other', 'people', 'riding', 'coach', 'force', 'ride', 'outside', 'Balsam', 'indication', 'prejudice', 'turned', 'being', 'what', 'is.But', 'when', 'are', 'robbed', 'gang', 'outlaws', 'led', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'superbly', 'nasty', 'heavy', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'passengers', 'including', 'Indian', 'agent', 'Frederic', 'March', 'realize', 'Newman', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'last', 'chance', 'survival', 'especially', 'Boone', 'kidnapped', 'March', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'Rush', 'end', 'result', 'sort', 'cynical', 'variation', 'John', 'Ford', '1939', 'classic', 'STAGECOACH', 'deliberate', 'part', 'Leonard', 'where', 'are', 'true', 'heroes', 'end', 'only', 'understanding', 'way', 'people', 'act', 'way', 'expect', 'be', 'treated.Filmed', 'primarily', 'location', 'desert', 'Tucson', 'Arizona', 'HOMBRE', 'bit', 'slower-paced', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'western', 'more', 'enough', 'good', 'points', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'Newman', 'incredibly', 'low-key', 'performance', 'disgust', 'white', 'man', 'world', 'never', 'expressed', 'shouting', 'sort', 'cynical', 'dialogue', 'people', 'Diane', 'Cilento', 'woman', 'who', 'get', 'bit', 'humanity', 'cynical', 'half-breed', 'Balsam', 'would', 'say', 'miscast', 'Mexican', 'good', 'enough', 'performance', 'Newman', 'one', 'link', 'people', 'white', 'man.Martin', 'Ritt', 'who', 'had', 'worked', 'Newman', 'several', 'films', 'notably', 'contemporary', '1963', 'western', 'HUD', 'assured', 'vigor', 'James', 'Wong', 'Howe', 'widescreen', 'cinematography', 'showing', 'barren', 'Arizona', 'landscape', 'best', 'ever', 'done', 'western', 'genre', 'especially', '1960s', 'something', 'message', 'movie', 'HOMBRE', 'message', 'well', 'keeping', 'decade', 'was', 'made', 'never', 'delivered', 'hamfisted', 'fashion', 'was', 'overlooked', 'film', 'day', 'recent', 'restoration', 'DVD', 'impressive', 'piece', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

Of course, as so often happens in cases like that, he doesn't fit either society. He's a blue-eyed white man but experiences all the general prejudices directed toward the Indians. In one part of the movie, he was even forced to ride outside on a stage coach rather than inside with the other more respectable passengers. It's rather pathetic, when you stop to think about it. Then, after the stage is held up by bandits, the passengers find themselves dependent on this man they have shown contempt for only a short time earlier. It's an interesting situation.

However, like vintage wine, this has received the respect it deserved.Well,written and depicted credibly by an all-star cast, Frederick March, Martin Balsam, Diane Cilento, Frank Silvera, (against image)Richard Boone and one of Newman's early co-stars, the lovely Barbara Rush.The existential elements are certainly there in full force. John Russell(Newman)half-breed inheritor of property wants nothing with materialism, or his adopted race. Self-reliant, stoical, seething with resentment, he boards the stagecoach with a bunch of hypocritical phonies,opportunists and a couple of tenderfoots. A couple hours on the road, trouble occurs. When the dust settles you have met one of the most unforgettable western characters, John Russell, who has taught white man what honesty,courage,ethics and religion has not to that point. Second, to Russell, in character and substance is Diane Cilento's character. Russell at the last second, took that opportunity from her to make his stand, and their last glance at one another acknowledged that.Cilento's part, gets passed over by reviewers,yet, hers was finely etched.

224650,A3D6OI36USYOU1,630024685X,Ghenghis,"[4, 8]","Fine performances by a laconic Paul Newman, a menacing Richard Boone, Martin Balsam as a Mexican(hahahahaha wait hahahaha), 3 hot women in a stagecoach (bet you never saw that before), and withouta doubt thee worst special effects in the history of the Western.OK, let's start with the ""blood thing"" that another reviewer mentioned as well. At 1:00:51 of the film,Paul Newman is standing on the back of the stagecoach aiming his rifle at the sky. Candy from Bonanzacatches one of these errant rounds and SPLAT! The ""blood"" first appears as a red spot on Candy's face,then on the next frame somebody apparently glopped red nail polish onto the print itself. You really haveto see this to believe it. Then Cameron Mitchell takes the next round, and he is rocketed from his horselike he was shot out of a cannon. No blood though, they must have used the whole bottle on Candy.Technical nits aside, and there are many more, this is an interesting but semi-boring movie that leans alittle to heavy on the ""message"" while not making much of an attempt to connect with the audience. FredericMarch is excellent as usual as the crooked Indian Agent that's been skimming the treasury of cash allocatedto buy food for Apaches on the reservation, and now is on the run with his wife Barbara Rush who is totallyout of place and does not belong in this movie. Diane Cilento is amazing as the boarding house mom displacedafter Newman inherits and sells her livelihood out from under her. She hides her contempt for Newman verywell. The first hour is a sleepthrough, the second hour moves at a little better pace, but as with a lot ofthese message flicks from this era, the finale is completely unsatisfying and leaves you flat.The soundtrack can basically be found in other Western drivel like Will Penny, or The Shootout. Sort of WalkingTallish if you know what I mean.The DVD wins no pity points either. The transfer is fine, pretty clean actually, with no remnants or artifactsunless you count the nail polish. The Dolby 2.0 is just adequate, there's not enough action here to justifypushing your speakers. No extras, just trailers for other Newman flicks.

It has action, but not too much. It focuses more on the interaction of its characters; the human condition. The cinematography by James Wong Howe, one of his last efforts, is crisp and expansive; shown magnificently on the DVD version. The score, by David Rose, is energetic and melodic. Director Martin Ritt made the most out of an unconventional plot with his powerhouse of a cast; and ultimately he filmed a picture that delivers a message without preaching.Paul Newman, a giant among actors, found something in his character, John Russell; a stillness, an incredible strength buried deep within honed survival skills, a quiet confidence, and ultimately a compassion for others. It is a very layered, compex, and brilliant portrayal.The supporting cast was excellent, surrounding Newman with talented adversaries and cronies. Diane Cilento, as Jesse, was willful, pragmatic, outgoing, yet still sexy; the earth mother of the piece. Richard Boone was the bad-to-the-bone Cicero Grimes; adding a new dimension to villiany. Yes he was mean, was a bully, was hard-as-nails, yet Boone still was able to show us an interesting man with deep shadows on his past; a gem of a performance. Fredric March, as the San Carlos Indian Agent, Mr. Favor, allowed us to dislike him, then pity him. He managed to dredge up a form of redemption out of the shoals of a potentially one-dimensional character. Martin Balsam found an odd humanity within his Mexican character, the stage driver Mendez; a man prone to compromise, a survivor. And in a small flashy part of a Mexican bandit, Frank Silvera made a tremendous impact. He helped us to like this brigand, and he shined with every gesture and line.Barbara Rush as Mrs. Favor, and Margaret Blye as the young Mrs. Blake, were both quite competent. One false note in the casting was Peter Lazer as Billy Lee Blake. Even with repeated viewings, his performance never improves. There is no real substance to it. He never managed to rev up his character to the level of those around him; like a Shetland pony competing in race with thoroughbreds. Cameron Mitchell and David Canary had great energy and smooth professionalism fused into their supporting roles.The most haunting moment of the film, what stays with you, is the death of John Russell. Newman had carefully established that this Hombre would not ""bleed"" for others. He was like a coyote bedding down with domestic dogs; an outcast. Yet it was his strength that all the others clung to in a crisis. So why, in the last gasp of the plot, would this hardened pariah suddenly sacrifice himself to save a woman who had demonstrated contempt for him ? We are left without a real answer, just a sweet sadness, and the awesome realization that we have witnessed some level of greatness.",5,AN OVERLOOKED CLASSIC,1043798400,"01 29, 2003",2003,2896,"['flat-out', 'great', 'western', 'even', 'often', 'overlooked', 'many', 'Best', 'existential', 'yet', 'spiritual', 'action', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'interaction', 'characters', 'human', 'condition', 'cinematography', 'James', 'Wong', 'Howe', 'one', 'last', 'efforts', 'crisp', 'expansive', 'shown', 'magnificently', 'DVD', 'version', 'score', 'David', 'Rose', 'energetic', 'melodic', 'Director', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'made', 'most', 'unconventional', 'plot', 'powerhouse', 'cast', 'ultimately', 'filmed', 'picture', 'message', 'preaching.Paul', 'Newman', 'giant', 'actors', 'found', 'something', 'character', 'John', 'Russell', 'stillness', 'incredible', 'strength', 'buried', 'deep', 'honed', 'survival', 'skills', 'quiet', 'confidence', 'ultimately', 'compassion', 'others', 'very', 'layered', 'compex', 'brilliant', 'portrayal.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'excellent', 'surrounding', 'Newman', 'talented', 'adversaries', 'cronies', 'Diane', 'Cilento', 'Jesse', 'was', 'willful', 'pragmatic', 'outgoing', 'yet', 'still', 'earth', 'mother', 'piece', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'was', 'bad-to-the-bone', 'Cicero', 'Grimes', 'adding', 'new', 'dimension', 'villiany', 'was', 'mean', 'was', 'bully', 'was', 'hard-as-nails', 'yet', 'Boone', 'still', 'was', 'able', 'show', 'interesting', 'man', 'deep', 'shadows', 'past', 'gem', 'performance', 'Fredric', 'March', 'San', 'Carlos', 'Indian', 'Agent', 'Mr', 'Favor', 'allowed', 'dislike', 'then', 'pity', 'managed', 'dredge', 'up', 'form', 'redemption', 'shoals', 'potentially', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'found', 'odd', 'humanity', 'Mexican', 'character', 'stage', 'driver', 'Mendez', 'man', 'prone', 'compromise', 'survivor', 'small', 'flashy', 'part', 'Mexican', 'bandit', 'Frank', 'Silvera', 'made', 'tremendous', 'impact', 'helped', 'like', 'brigand', 'shined', 'gesture', 'line.Barbara', 'Rush', 'Mrs', 'Favor', 'Margaret', 'Blye', 'young', 'Mrs.', 'Blake', 'were', 'quite', 'competent', 'One', 'false', 'note', 'casting', 'was', 'Peter', 'Lazer', 'Billy', 'Lee', 'Blake', 'Even', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'performance', 'never', 'real', 'substance', 'never', 'managed', 'rev', 'up', 'character', 'level', 'Shetland', 'pony', 'competing', 'race', 'thoroughbreds', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'David', 'Canary', 'had', 'great', 'energy', 'smooth', 'professionalism', 'fused', 'supporting', 'roles.The', 'most', 'haunting', 'moment', 'film', 'what', 'death', 'John', 'Russell', 'Newman', 'had', 'carefully', 'established', 'Hombre', 'would', 'not', 'bleed', 'others', 'was', 'coyote', 'bedding', 'down', 'domestic', 'dogs', 'outcast', 'was', 'strength', 'others', 'clung', 'crisis', 'So', 'why', 'last', 'gasp', 'plot', 'would', 'hardened', 'pariah', 'suddenly', 'save', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'demonstrated', 'contempt', 'are', 'left', 'real', 'answer', 'just', 'sweet', 'sadness', 'awesome', 'realization', 'have', 'witnessed', 'level', 'greatness']",N/A

224657,AV64Y0L3C45UX,630024685X,James Blakley,"[0, 0]","HOMBRE is a great Western. Not because of Richard Boone's uncharacteristic turn from noble 'Paladin' fame to the greedy infamy of Cicero Grimes. Through no fault of Boone's, Grimes is a caricature. Sure he mouths some memorable lines; a favorite being, ""Well now: What do you suppose Hell is gonna look like?""But in the greater scheme, Grimes and his gang of outlaws were written as the brute force that bands a bunch of otherwise unpleasant people together. HOMBRE'S more captivating storyline surrounds a group of world-weary, turn-of-the-century frontierspeople who look to 'get outta Dodge', but get more than they ever bargained for during a stagecoach trip through the desert Southwest.What truly makes HOMBRE exceptional are the writer and director's greater attention to some deeper, darker themes: Namely, the racists that Paul Newman's expatriate character John Russell encounters. Ironically, the movie also tarnishes Russell with an apathetic aloofness and inability to see how the Apaches (with whom he choses to live) could be just as ruthless to their own people as whites were to them.  Whether its hastily selling his deceased father's property (which is the impetus for most of the characters' embarking for greener pastures) or letting Grimes bully a passenger out of his ticket, Russell (as a fellow traveller notes) ""isn't a figure to command much confidence."" And perhaps that's the most fascinating observation about HOMBRE: few of what are supposed to be ""the good guys"" do command respect or confidence.The philosophical debate of the merits of justice and injustice between Diane Cilento's compassionate, feministic Jessie and Russell (as another character is tortured by Grimes's gang)is a pivotal moment in the movie, and is far more riveting in its tension than the forced, guns drawn confrontations between Grimes and Russell (which seemed like concessions to those looking for the trappings of a more tradtional Western).Daring to show the many layers of racism and to expose some of the myths that survived the passing Old West are what distinguish HOMBRE from most Westerns. It is ultimately a movie where the viewer finds himself/herself rooting for the lesser of several evils. That's the enduring magic that director Martin Ritt brought to HOMBRE: Presenting the duality and hypocrisy that is present in reality while still engaging the thinking viewer in an atypical, but entertaining, Wild West experience.",5,A thinking person's Western: Engaging ideas instead of people,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,2444,"['HOMBRE', 'great', 'Western', 'Not', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'uncharacteristic', 'turn', 'noble', 'fame', 'greedy', 'infamy', 'Cicero', 'Grimes', 'fault', 'Boone', 'Grimes', 'caricature', 'memorable', 'lines', 'favorite', 'being', 'Well', 'now', 'What', 'do', 'suppose', 'Hell', 'gon', 'look', 'greater', 'scheme', 'Grimes', 'gang', 'outlaws', 'were', 'written', 'brute', 'force', 'bunch', 'otherwise', 'unpleasant', 'people', 'together', 'HOMBRE', 'more', 'captivating', 'storyline', 'group', 'world-weary', 'turn-of-the-century', 'frontierspeople', 'who', 'look', ""'get"", 'outta', 'Dodge', 'get', 'more', 'ever', 'bargained', 'stagecoach', 'trip', 'desert', 'Southwest.What', 'truly', 'HOMBRE', 'exceptional', 'are', 'writer', 'director', 'greater', 'attention', 'deeper', 'darker', 'themes', 'Namely', 'racists', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'expatriate', 'character', 'John', 'Russell', 'encounters', 'Ironically', 'movie', 'also', 'Russell', 'apathetic', 'aloofness', 'inability', 'see', 'how', 'Apaches', 'whom', 'live', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'ruthless', 'own', 'people', 'whites', 'were', 'hastily', 'selling', 'deceased', 'father', 'property', 'impetus', 'most', 'characters', 'embarking', 'greener', 'pastures', 'letting', 'Grimes', 'bully', 'passenger', 'ticket', 'Russell', 'fellow', 'traveller', 'notes', ""n't"", 'figure', 'command', 'much', 'confidence', 'perhaps', 'most', 'fascinating', 'observation', 'HOMBRE', 'few', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'good', 'guys', 'do', 'command', 'respect', 'confidence.The', 'philosophical', 'debate', 'merits', 'justice', 'injustice', 'Diane', 'Cilento', 'compassionate', 'feministic', 'Jessie', 'Russell', 'character', 'tortured', 'Grimes', 'gang', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'riveting', 'tension', 'forced', 'guns', 'drawn', 'confrontations', 'Grimes', 'Russell', 'seemed', 'concessions', 'looking', 'trappings', 'more', 'tradtional', 'Western', '.Daring', 'show', 'many', 'layers', 'racism', 'expose', 'myths', 'survived', 'passing', 'Old', 'West', 'are', 'what', 'distinguish', 'HOMBRE', 'most', 'Westerns', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'where', 'viewer', 'rooting', 'lesser', 'several', 'evils', 'enduring', 'magic', 'director', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'brought', 'HOMBRE', 'Presenting', 'duality', 'hypocrisy', 'present', 'reality', 'still', 'engaging', 'thinking', 'viewer', 'atypical', 'entertaining', 'Wild', 'West', 'experience']",N/A

Newman plays John Russell, a half-Indian, half-White man who is living a peaceful tribal life until he inherits a boarding house. When he sells it, the landlady (Diane Cilento, who at that time was Mrs. Sean Connery) and several tenants are out on the street. Fate lands Newman and this unhappy bunch on the same stagecoach out of town, and that stagecoach is subsequently robbed and the entire group left in the middle of nowhere. Despite their resentment toward Russell, the others are forced to depend upon him for survival. Despite his ambivalence toward White people, Russell is drawn  by a sense of decency into their dilemma.Much of the film centers around moral debates between Cilento and Newman. To its credit, the movie paints no easy answers to the questions it raises, and manages to be interesting and exciting, not merely didactic.

He is essentially a man without a country, and is despised and disparaged by virtually everyone until the stagecoach he is riding in is held-up by bad-guy Richard Boone. They are after a load of money embesseled by Indian Agent Dr. Favor (Fredrick March) Hombre, who refuses to be taken, fights back and drives off the outlaws, but they manage to take Dr. Favors wife (Barbara Rush) hostage.  The passengers, now stranded in the desert, must make their way back to the safety of civilization before Boone and his gang can recoup and attack them again.  So the passengers now turn to Hombre (Newman) to lead them to safety. Hombre coolly and bravely leads them to the very brink of safety only to be accosted by Boone and his gang demanding the money in return for the woman hostage.  The final showdown, where the woman is exchanged for the money ransom, is an absolute nail biter.  Hombre, despite the injustices of his fellow white passengers, risks his own life for the life of the white woman who despised him.This film is all of 4-stars.  It is a little known western, but is considered one of the 50 best westerns on many lists.  Newman carries the film of course, and his portrayal of Hombre is realistic and satisfying.  Boone is absolutely the best bad-guy the western movie genre has ever seen. The supporting cast is more than excellent, especially Diane Cliento, (Sean Connery's first wife) lending a realism to the film through the strength of the characters.  The movie's musical score is superb.  ""Hombre's theme"", the title cut, is a hauntingly, lonesome western classic in itself (look it up on You-Tube).This is a film that moves right along with no dull moments.

Williams,"[0, 0]","John Russell (Paul Newman) is a man adopted early on by indians and then later by a sympathetic white man who dies and leaves in his will a boarding house run by Jesse (Diane Cilento).  Russell decides to sell the boarding house and buy a herd of cattle down in Contention, leaving Jesse high and dry with her live in boy friend, the less than honest sheriff.Meanwhile, the indian agent, Mr. Favor (Frederick March) attempts to rent a stage coach in order to abscound with money he and his wife cheated the indians out of.  Here they meet Cicero Grimes, villain and very unsavory character, who also wants a seat on the coach in order to rob Favor of the money he stole.Russell too buys a ticket and they head out only to encounter the one time sheriff and his gang of Mexican outlaws, who has gone bad and is in on the plot to steal the money from Favor.  The horses and water are taken leaving Russell, Jesse, Favor, the driver (Martin Balsam) and the rest on foot in rugged country far from civilization. Russell then, because of his wilderness knowledge, is elected to show them the way home, while fighting outlaws along the way.The plot has many twists in it and racial bigotry is explored.  When this film first was released, indians were still sometimes viewed as the unwanted enemy to all white men.The acting and actors are supberb.  The script is well thought out and the characterization highly believable.  I believe this is one of the all time best classic western films.

224679,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,630024685X,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 0]","This film was of a quality that astonished me, once I put it on.  It is the story of a man, who though abducted as a boy by Apaches and re-taken into white society, has chosen to live with the Indians.  He shares their struggle for existence, with a keen sense of the mortal insult that their subjugation has brought them.  The viewer witnesses this in the first minutes of the film, when Newman waits to capture mustangs with some friends and is summoned to meet a customer with a message for him in a bar.  The only thing to indicate he is white are his startling blue eyes.So begins a muted adventure as Newman gains, through a modest inheritance, the means to quit his home on a stagecoach.  The other passengers include a troubled young couple, a woman he disenfranchised when he accepted his inheritance, an ex-administrator of Indian territories, and a mean SOB.  Newman is taciturn during the journey, rarely communicating except in single syllables and accepting to be put out of the main car because of his indian ways.  It is a masterpiece of under-stated acting, a classic introvert who the others under-estimate.  Things don't work as out planed, of course, and I don't want to play the spoiler as to what happens.  Needless to say, the passengers are endangered to their surprise, and the resolution is wonderfully unexpected, yet bleak.I think this is some of the best acting that Newman ever did.  His performance is riveting, even if so laconic and circumspect that the viewer is misled as to his true character.  There are many echoes of Little Big Man in this film, but coldly grim rather than the tragic, if uplifting comedy in the later film.Recommended with enthusiasm.",5,"an extravaganza of brutality, venality, and receding hope",1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,1691,"['film', 'was', 'quality', 'astonished', 'once', 'put', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'though', 'abducted', 'boy', 'Apaches', 're-taken', 'white', 'society', 'chosen', 'live', 'Indians', 'shares', 'struggle', 'existence', 'keen', 'sense', 'mortal', 'insult', 'subjugation', 'brought', 'viewer', 'first', 'minutes', 'film', 'when', 'Newman', 'capture', 'mustangs', 'friends', 'summoned', 'meet', 'customer', 'message', 'bar', 'only', 'thing', 'indicate', 'white', 'are', 'startling', 'blue', 'eyes.So', 'muted', 'adventure', 'Newman', 'gains', 'modest', 'inheritance', 'means', 'quit', 'home', 'stagecoach', 'other', 'passengers', 'include', 'troubled', 'young', 'couple', 'woman', 'disenfranchised', 'when', 'accepted', 'inheritance', 'ex-administrator', 'Indian', 'territories', 'mean', 'SOB', 'Newman', 'taciturn', 'journey', 'rarely', 'communicating', 'single', 'syllables', 'accepting', 'be', 'put', 'main', 'car', 'indian', 'ways', 'masterpiece', 'under-stated', 'acting', 'classic', 'introvert', 'who', 'others', 'under-estimate', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'planed', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'play', 'spoiler', 'what', 'Needless', 'say', 'passengers', 'are', 'endangered', 'surprise', 'resolution', 'wonderfully', 'unexpected', 'yet', 'bleak.I', 'think', 'best', 'acting', 'Newman', 'ever', 'did', 'performance', 'riveting', 'even', 'so', 'laconic', 'circumspect', 'viewer', 'misled', 'true', 'character', 'are', 'many', 'echoes', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'film', 'coldly', 'rather', 'tragic', 'uplifting', 'comedy', 'later', 'film.Recommended', 'enthusiasm']",N/A
224680,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,630024685X,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[3, 4]","There has been no tougher or more formidable Western heavy than Richard Boone... He was a fine, respected actor and powerful presence, one of the screen's most efficient scene-stealer...In 'The Tall T,' Boone was Randolph Scott's intelligent, embittered adversary, smooth as a rattlesnake and twice as treacherous; in 'Man Without a Star,' he wrapped non-conforming farmers in barbed wire; in 'Way of a Gaucho,' he was a mean, sadistic Major who persecuted Rory Calhoun; and in 'Hombre' he gave Paul Newman a rough ride: 'Well, now, what do you suppose hell is gonna look like?'Not many of the serious Westerns of the late sixties can match the mood and authenticity of Martin Ritt's 'Hombre.' It is a suspenseful Western melodrama pointing up racial bias and hypocrisy, with a plot modeled on greed, nobility, prejudice and resignation...John Russell (Paul Newman) has no emotion (except anger) and little vitality; he's totally alienated from mankind and is 'alienating' as well... Russell is a white man raised by the Indians, who call him ""Hombre,"" and with whom he identifies...Choosing to isolate himself from white society, which he despises, he lives on a reservation and looks and dresses like an Indian... But he's persuaded to cut his hair and return to civilization to take over some property... He winds up on a stagecoach with white passengers, who, learning his background, force him to ride with the driver... Not quite an Indian, and banished by whites, he's the classic outcast in no man's land... Ironically, Russell is the only one capable of rescuing the passengers from bandits and guiding them back to civilization... The drama depends on whether he will accept responsibility for his fellow man...""Hombre,"" which reunited Newman with the ""Hud"" team (director Ritt, writers Ravetch and Frank, cinematographer Howe), resembles John Ford's classic Western, ""Stagecoach"": several people, whose personal crises are outlined, are thrown together, and their interactions provide a social commentary on avarice, bigotry and responsibility... But in Ford's film, those deemed worthless by society reveal their inherent nobility, and only one man, the absconding banker, is bad... Here, the embezzler of Indian funds--Favor (Fredric March), is not much worse than the others... Except for Jessie (Diane Cilento), an honest, earthy woman in the Patricia Neal-Hud vein, they're all helpless, coward1y or selfish...In this context, Russell is an inversion of the John Wayne hero... He's strong and silent in the traditional manner, but instead of being the expected virile defender of the weak, he helps the others only when his own survival is at stake... He refuses to intercede when the malevolent bandit Grimes (Richard Boone) deprives a soldier of his seat; is willing to leave the helpless passengers stranded; indifferently sends Favor out into the desert without water; and declines to rescue Favor's Indian-hating wife (Barbara Rush), left by the bandits to bake in the sun...Even though he acts out of a justifiable outrage, Russell is not meant to be a sympathetic character: the white man's mistreatment may have made him indifferently cruel, but cruel he is, nevertheless... Perhaps to soften our attitude, the filmmakers have him suddenly abandon his disengagement at the end, and perform the traditional act to rescue Favor's wife...Newman's performance here is unlike any of his others... His style has been stripped away to the bare essentials; to call it underplaying would be an understatement... He imparts a sense of transcendent stillness; when he acts he does so suddenly, returning immediately thereafter to his relatively immobile state... He speaks laconically, in clipped sentences, with a solemn, deliberately monotonous, almost lifeless voice... In addition, his facial expression hard1y changes; at times it approaches an infinitesimal smile, but otherwise it is unsociable, severe, bitter, or inscrutably neutral...At first glance, it seems that Newman is hard1y acting, and some critics called him wooden... Russell's inscrutable expression is a mask to cover his ingrained hurt, and suggests a man in a constant state of meditation or deep reflection on the chaos around him... Appropriately, the film opens and closes on close-ups of his face, and throughout, our attention is directed toward the blue eyes, which are constantly watching, thinking, judging, condemning...Newman also frequently folds his arms as if protecting or insulating himself from the world--a natural defense mechanism of someone who's suffered a great deal of pain, and a physical equivalent of his psychological introversion... This is Newman's most completely self-sufficient, isolated, and inhuman loner, and he gives a performance that bravely risks complete alienation of the audience... And that's what happens; as in ""Torn Curtain,"" the character is ultimately non-involving... But it's an extremely interesting piece of disciplined acting...Martin Ritt puts the whole picture together in a straight, precise layout of plots, accumulating action that holds interest up to the big scenes... Of all the sequences which stay in the mind, perhaps the most memorable is that in which the Mexican bandit (Frank Silvera) painfully congratulates Russell as a sharp shooter: 'Hey, Hombre! A compliment on your shooting. You put a hole in me.'",5,"Not many of the serious Westerns can match the mood and authenticity of Ritt's ""Hombre."",",1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,5359,"['been', 'tougher', 'more', 'formidable',

Paul Newman plays the lead role of an Anglo man who was raised from childhood as an Apache, but later adopted by a well-meaning Anglo who took him away from his Apache family.  Newman considers himself to be an Apache for all of his later adaptation to Anglo society, and he is embittered by the treatment of the Apaches by the encroaching Anglos.  The story involves a stagecoach ride across the desert in which the party is repeatedly subjected to choices.  Each member of the group reacts differently, and Newman portrays his character with elan and insight.  The supporting cast is excellent as well.This one moves too slowly for some viewers, no doubt, but really every scene in the film contributes to the story, and this one held my interest throughout.

This is a much better movie -- based on a story by Elmore Leonard, with a fine script, distinct characters, and clear plotting, it is also not a standard Western. (I suppose ""Butch Cassidy"" wasn't either!)  Here Newman plays John Russell, a white man who has lived with Indians (in his case, Apaches) since childhood and has come to appreciate the ways in which white men have made life all but impossible for them.  (The opening titles play poignantly against some famous photographic images of Native American life, some of which are almost iconic.)  When Russell inherits a hotel from the white man who had adopted him (and from whom he had run back to the Apaches), he has to confront his being white to some extent.  Clearly, his preference is to sell the hotel, take the money, and go back to live with the Apaches, but on a coach out of town, with a motley crew of passengers, complications occur.  It turns out that some of the passengers aren't who they seem to be, and circumstances arise in which a number of them are dependent on Russell's Indian skills to get them safely back to civilization.Their difficulties aren't simply those of a barren hilly land -- they have money which bad guys (led here by Richard Boone, taking a break from ""Have Gun, Will Travel"") want, and they have a hostage to bargain with.  Since I'm trying to avoid spoilers, let me just say that the bargaining sharpens ethical dilemmas, although not everyone sees the dilemmas in the same way.  The ending is tense and powerful and, like the movie as a whole, directed with clarity and economy.  While one or two of the characters verge on stereotypes, the dialogue has a freshness and frankness that make us take them as individuals first.Newman is splendid as Russell -- realistic, laconic, composed, he's seen worse in his Apache life (extremes of danger and hunger) than anything he sees here.  It becomes clear, though, that, composed as he is, some of the insulting ways in which some passengers refer to Indians have wounded him, and in his mind there's a real question of whether he owes them any help at all.  The quite long, wordless opening scene, with the horses, marvelously foreshadows the patience, quietness, and, when push comes to shove, decisiveness of Russell.  Diane Cilento is Jessie, the tough woman who has been managing the hotel that Russell decided to sell, and in a great scene in which the other two women are running down their men, Jessie claims to like them, ""although they've put some grey in my hair.""  Martin Balsam is a very credible Mexican friend of Russell's who, like Jessie, speaks up for reasonableness and ""civilized"" behaviour in a situation where it is neither appropriate nor safe to be ""civilized.""  The other actors are fine, and Richard Boone does a great job as a sleazy but attractive villain.  To sum up: I hadn't heard of this movie before, but I'm impressed by it.

224688,AK61LQI92GTCH,630024685X,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[12, 28]","The blue-eyed Paul Newman as a half-breed Apache?  Weren't there quite a few folks a-waiting on a stage considering that the stagecoach company was practically defunct, presumably because of a lack of customers?  Why didn't most of them, `ceptin' the women folk, ride horses rather than take the stage?  Why did they leave the water in the mine shaft?  If you're sure the nasty bandito is going to shoot at you, why tell the kid to ""wait `til he reaches for his gun"" before shooting him?I asked a lot of questions while watching HOMBRE, and that usually ain't a good thing.  Considering this was taken from a novel written by the usually reliable Elmore Leonard, it's a little mystifying as well.A cynic would say these plot pimples were necessary to make things work.  Look, you ain't gonna put brown contacts on Paul Newman's eyes, for criminy sake, and in 1967 there weren't many stars with stronger box office than Newman.  We had to get the folks together on a stagecoach so Barbara Rush, the wife of corrupt Indian agent Frederic March, could get the vapors and see to it that half-breed John Russell (Newman) would be asked to ride on the roof.  We had to keep the boys off the horses and on the benches because we needed to see bad guy Grimes (Richard Boone, excellent as usual) stink up the coach with his boorish manners and his cigars.  They had to leave the water in the mine shaft so that the corrupt Indian agent Dr. Alex Favor (March) could reunite his venal self with the group.That said, with all its question, HOMBRE is a good movie.  In a beautiful opening scene a boss horse leads a group of wild horses into a corral.  Director Martin Ritt is a master at sustained scenes that build with little or no dialogue.HOMBRE belongs in that herd of movies that came out in the 60s and 70s that cast a critical eye on American culture.  They reflected the tensions in society - hawks versus doves, pacifists versus Joe hardhats, the silent majority versus the vocal minority.  Like other movies of that ilk, HOMBRE has a quasi-religious outsider at the center of the movie, and that central character is used to reflect and magnify the failures of society.  In HOMBRE the white men are venal, immature, corrupt, evil and impotent.The transitional figure, the one that links the hero to the dominant society, is the Mexican Henry Mendez (Martin Balsam.)  That a movie attacking racism should cast the anything-but-latino Balsam is one of the sweet ironies of the time.  Balsam is good, though, and in a pivotal scene with Russell he lays it out for him.  Russell's adoptive uncle has died and leaves him a boarding house and some land. Leaves him a stake in society.  He tells Russell, who is living on the reservation at the time, to get his haircut.  Look like a white man.  Make it easier on yourself.  ""A Mexican,"" Mendez says, "" is closer to a white man than an Apache.  I'll tell you that."" Tune out, turn off and drop in, Hombre.Well, quasi-religious figures in a Judeo- Christian culture haven't got a lot of options left by the time they reach the end of the last reel.  For some strange reason we find ritual bloodletting deeply satisfying and a road sign to Higher Meaning.  So be it.  Many people will love HOMBRE for its passion.  For my part, I'll remember with fondest pleasure watching Richard Boone guffaw, threaten, and intimidate his bad bad self through an otherwise okay western.The only extras on this dvd are a clutch of theatrical trailers for Paul Newman movies.  The trailer for THE HUSTLER has a snazzy, jazzy feel to it and I recommend it.",3,Hombre,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,3578,"['blue-eyed', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'half-breed', 'Apache', 'Were', ""n't"", 'there', 'quite', 'few', 'folks', 'a-waiting', 'stage', 'considering', 'stagecoach', 'company', 'was', 'practically', 'defunct', 'presumably', 'lack', 'customers', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'most', 'ceptin', 'women', 'folk', 'ride', 'rather', 'take', 'stage', 'Why', 'did', 'leave', 'water', 'mine', 'shaft', ""'re"", 'sure', 'nasty', 'bandito', 'going', 'shoot', 'why', 'tell', 'kid', 'wait', 'til', 'gun', 'shooting', 'asked', 'lot', 'questions', 'watching', 'HOMBRE', 'usually', 'ai', ""n't"", 'good', 'thing', 'Considering', 'was', 'taken', 'novel', 'written', 'usually', 'reliable', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'little', 'mystifying', 'well.A', 'cynic', 'would', 'say', 'plot', 'pimples', 'were', 'necessary', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'Look', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'put', 'brown', 'contacts', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'eyes', 'criminy', 'sake', '1967', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'stars', 'stronger', 'box', 'office', 'Newman', 'had', 'get', 'folks', 'together', 'stagecoach', 'so', 'Barbara', 'Rush', 'wife', 'corrupt', 'Indian', 'agent', 'Frederic', 'March', 'could', 'get', 'vapors', 'see', 'half-breed', 'John', 'Russell', 'Newman', 'would', 'be', 'asked', 'ride', 'roof', 'had', 'keep', 'boys', 'horses', 'benches', 'needed', 'see', 'bad', 'guy', 'Grimes', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'excellent', 'usual', 'stink', 'up', 'coach', 'boorish', 'manners', 'cigars', 'had', 'leave', 'water', 'mine', 'shaft', 'so', 'corrupt', 'Indian', 'agent', 'Dr.', 'Alex', 'Favor', 'March', 'could', 'reunite', 'venal', 'self', 'group.That', 'said', 'question', 'HOMBRE', 'good', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'opening', 'scene', 'boss', 'horse', 'group', 'wild', 'horses', 'corral', 'Director', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'master', 'sustained', 'scenes', 'build', 'little', 'dialogue.HOMBRE', 'belongs', 'herd', 'movies', 'came', 'out', '60s', '70s', 'cast', 'critical', 'eye', 'American', 'culture', 'reflected', 'tensions', 'society', 'hawks', 'versus', 'doves', 'pacifists', 'versus', 'Joe', 'hardhats', 'silent', 'majority', 'vocal', 'minority', 'other', 'movies', 'ilk', 'HOMBRE', 'quasi-religious', 'outsider', 'center', 'movie', 'central', 'character', 'used', 'reflect', 'magnify', 'failures', 'society', 'HOMBRE', 'white', 'men', 'are', 'venal', 'immature', 'corrupt', 'evil', 'impotent.The', 'transitional', 'figure', 'one', 'hero', 'dominant', 'society', 'Mexican', 'Henry', 'Mendez', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'movie', 'attacking', 'racism', 'should', 'cast', 'anything-but-latino', 'Balsam', 'one', 'sweet', 'ironies', 'time', 'Balsam', 'good', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'Russell', 'out', 'Russell', 'adoptive', 'uncle', 'died', 'boarding', 'house', 'land', 'stake', 'society', 'Russell', 'who', 'living', 'reservation', 'time', 'get', 'haircut', 'Look', 'white', 'man', 'Make', 'easier', 'Mexican', 'Mendez', 'closer', 'white', 'man', 'Apache', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'out', 'turn', 'off', 'drop', 'Hombre.Well', 'quasi-religious', 'figures', 'Judeo-', 'Christian', 'culture', 'have', ""n't"", 'got', 'lot', 'options', 'left', 'time', 'reach', 'end', 'last', 'reel', 'strange', 'reason', 'find', 'ritual', 'bloodletting', 'deeply', 'satisfying', 'road', 'sign', 'Higher', 'Meaning', 'So', 'be', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'HOMBRE', 'passion', 'part', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'fondest', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'guffaw', 'threaten', 'intimidate', 'bad', 'bad', 'self', 'otherwise', 'okay', 'western.The', 'only', 'dvd', 'are', 'clutch', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'movies', 'trailer', 'THE', 'HUSTLER', 'snazzy', 'jazzy', 'feel', 'recommend']",N/A
