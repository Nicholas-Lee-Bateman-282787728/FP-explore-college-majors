Billy Zane is seldom actually on the screenand if he's cringingly viewed the final hideous product he most likely wishes hecould afford to buy up every single copy.  This is not something any real actorshould want included in his filmography.  It was a career mistake and is not evenremotely as entertaining as any of his previous films that we've watched.His usual charm is replaced with a dreading grimace and it looks as if he wascontractually forced into doing this. I imagine he was furious when he realizedwhat he was mired in.  The agent who got him into this needed to be fired... sued even.I -genuinely- felt pity watching him grit his teeth and squirm on the evil villain's throneduring some of his several (total) film minutes. He looks like he's in actor's purgatory.Skid Row seemed a step up. Poor Billy Zane!The producers are simply using Zane's name to sell a very poor product and he is -not-even a principal performer in it.  It's far better to consider Zane's work withouthaving ever seen this at all.The rest of the cast seem to be recruited from the Live Action Role Playing fantasycommunity (was the script author?) and not regular medieval/renaissance reenactment people(in which case it would have looked a lot better even if the script, directing and acting sucked).This film is amateurish and doesn't resemble even a modest effort by limited intellects.It would be Just to put the Producers'/Director's names on the box for ridicule instead.I hope this is their last effort in that regard because it should have been burnt in the can.Buy it and you will want your time and money back.Billy deserves a better reputation than this.  Burn it!",1,So bad I feel real pity for Billy Zane....,1289174400,"11 8, 2010",2010,1945,"[""'ve"", 'bought', 'thousands', 'period/action/adventure', 'movies', 'last', 'few', 'decades.That', 'said', 'definitely', 'bottom', 'ten', 'percent', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen.It', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'what', 'Barbarella', 'did', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'only', 'script', 'sets', 'props', 'costumes', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'seldom', 'actually', 'screenand', 'cringingly', 'viewed', 'final', 'hideous', 'product', 'most', 'likely', 'wishes', 'hecould', 'afford', 'buy', 'up', 'single', 'copy', 'not', 'something', 'real', 'actorshould', 'want', 'included', 'filmography', 'was', 'career', 'mistake', 'not', 'evenremotely', 'as', 'entertaining', 'previous', 'films', ""'ve"", 'watched.His', 'usual', 'charm', 'replaced', 'dreading', 'grimace', 'wascontractually', 'forced', 'doing', 'imagine', 'was', 'furious', 'when', 'realizedwhat', 'was', 'mired', 'agent', 'who', 'got', 'needed', 'be', 'fired', 'sued', 'even.I', '-genuinely-', 'felt', 'pity', 'watching', 'grit', 'teeth', 'squirm', 'evil', 'villain', 'throneduring', 'several', 'total', 'film', 'minutes', 'actor', 'purgatory.Skid', 'Row', 'seemed', 'step', 'up', 'Poor', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'producers', 'are', 'simply', 'using', 'Zane', 'name', 'sell', 'very', 'poor', 'product', '-not-even', 'principal', 'performer', 'far', 'better', 'consider', 'Zane', 'work', 'withouthaving', 'ever', 'seen', 'all.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'seem', 'be', 'recruited', 'Live', 'Action', 'Role', 'Playing', 'fantasycommunity', 'was', 'script', 'author', 'not', 'regular', 'medieval/renaissance', 'reenactment', 'people', 'case', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'lot', 'better', 'even', 'script', 'directing', 'acting', 'sucked', '.This', 'film', 'amateurish', ""n't"", 'resemble', 'even', 'modest', 'effort', 'limited', 'intellects.It', 'would', 'be', 'Just', 'put', ""Producers'/Director"", 'names', 'box', 'ridicule', 'instead.I', 'hope', 'last', 'effort', 'regard', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'burnt', 'can.Buy', 'will', 'want', 'time', 'money', 'back.Billy', 'better', 'reputation', 'Burn']",N/A

The hero of the story who is supposedly the greatest warrior ever born---or reborn, supposedly goes from being a nitwit, to all encompassing sword god in all of 10 minutes of training from an old soldier.This movie should only be gotten by fantasy completionist that want every fantasy movie in their collection, everyone else could do with a dollar rental, and you might say you paid to much for even that, so you've been warned.",2,An Epic Saga it is not,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,917,"['are', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'wrong', 'movie', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'where', 'start', 'i', 'guess', 'i', 'have', 'start', 'costumes', 'costumes', 'look', 'came', 'straight', 'renaissance', 'fair', 'are', 'brightest', 'mid', 'evil', 'clothing', 'would', 'ever', 'see', 'so', 'bright', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'super', 'duper', 'washers', 'dryers', 'back', 'then', 'voice', 'acting', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'who', 'very', 'rarely', 'even', 'seen', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'cash', 'make', 'hero', 'story', 'who', 'supposedly', 'greatest', 'warrior', 'ever', 'born', '-or', 'reborn', 'supposedly', 'being', 'nitwit', 'encompassing', 'sword', 'god', '10', 'minutes', 'training', 'old', 'soldier.This', 'movie', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'gotten', 'fantasy', 'completionist', 'want', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'collection', 'everyone', 'else', 'could', 'do', 'dollar', 'rental', 'might', 'say', 'paid', 'much', 'even', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned']",N/A

But I simply cannot do so for this. I got this movie from a Redbox, but goodness, it was so bad that even though it was just a dollar, I feel completely ripped off. The dialog... wow, bad writing. The acting - jeez, these guys were OBVIOUSLY amateurs - and not even good ones. The costumes looked fake, and I barely paid attention after like, 15 min and opened my laptop because I just could not give this atrocity my full focus.I'm also really surprised that Billy Zane agreed to be in this. He was in some great movies like Titanic or the Mummy, so I have no idea what would make him want to do something like this. Maybe he wanted a big role or whatever.",1,what,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,752,"['try', 'be', 'fair', 'reviews', 'can', 'try', 'look', 'something', 'good', 'bad', 'product', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'got', 'movie', 'Redbox', 'goodness', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'even', 'was', 'just', 'dollar', 'feel', 'completely', 'ripped', 'off', 'dialog', 'wow', 'bad', 'writing', 'acting', 'jeez', 'guys', 'were', 'OBVIOUSLY', 'amateurs', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'ones', 'costumes', 'looked', 'fake', 'barely', 'paid', 'attention', '15', 'min', 'opened', 'laptop', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'give', 'atrocity', 'full', 'focus.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'really', 'surprised', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'agreed', 'be', 'was', 'great', 'movies', 'Titanic', 'Mummy', 'so', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'would', 'make', 'want', 'do', 'something', 'Maybe', 'wanted', 'big', 'role']",N/A

The acting is REALLY BAD and overly dramatic in an unbelieveable way.  I was not sure if it was a comedy or a spoof.. I'm still processing it, trying to figure out what the intent of the movie was.  One scene was used for an early part then used again for a scene that takes place 8 years later. This ranks as one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  But HEY!, we all like different things.

1370565,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B003XFN1YQ,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[13, 15]","There are positives in this movie. The scenery at times is good. The women are all pretty, and for the most part show a lot of leg. The story is based on the classic cosmic myth that is the basis for many religions. There is an evil king (Orion) who is counseled by wise men (belt of Orion) about a child who will usurp the king (coma).The king has a slaughter of the innocents (Eridanus @ Rigel) and there is a maiden (Virgo). Add to that the legend of Excalibur and I think you get the general plot of the story.The script is bad. The acting is bad. The costumes are very bad. The armor worn by the knights does not cover their arms and legs. The knights who wear the armor walk around all the time with their helmet visors down. The movie made use of eerie ""special effect"" contact lenses, voice enhancers and cheap rubber masks. The guy who is the ""chosen one"" is supposed to lead the battle against the king, but he can't fight a lick. He takes fighting lessons during a music montage that includes a belly dancer.  His brother who is a fighter is in prison. What was the midget in the costume with three fingers supposed to be?The cover on the DVD looks like this would be a great epic action adventure such as Conan. Don't be fooled.  This would make for a great MST movie. You might want to watch it stoned and have a good laugh. Talking and cell phones are permitted during the movie.",1,DR.
