1382390,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0041YI4ZO,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[39, 42]","There is no denying that the legend of martial arts teacher Yip Man (also known as the man who taught Wing Chun to Bruce Lee) have been a financial success in Asia.With the popularity of the first two ""Ip Man"" films starring Donnie Yen, there have been big questions on how to continue the Ip Man stories, especially with Donnie Yen not wanting to do anymore Ip Man films.  The solution, focus on a prequel while Ip Man was young or focus in the future when he is much older.And in 2010, Director Herman Yau (""All's Well Ends Well 2010', ""The Eight Immortals Restaurant: The Untold Story"") and screenwriter Erica Lee (""King of Comedy"", ""Only Fools Fall in Love"") decided to do the former with their film ""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"".While not an officially related to the first two films, Yau did cast Dennis To who looks like a younger Donnie Yen, while also casting Sammo Hung and Fan Siu-wong who both appeared in the previous Donnie Yen ""Ip Man"" films.  But perhaps the biggest draw was the casting of Ip Chun, the actual son of Ip Man, who plays the role as Leung Bik (the man who would teach Ip Man a new style of Wing Chun).While the film does take liberties by creating fictional stories around the true story of Ip Man's actual martial arts training when he was younger, the addition of half-brother and also Japanese antagonists continues the trend of foreign invaders vs. Ip Man.VIDEO:""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and the film is intentionally saturated and warm in the beginning but later becomes fully detailed and colors are vibrant.  There is very good clarity and detail on clothing and wooden objects, doors and fences.  You can see the detail on the album that Wing-shing is carrying as each line around the album is visible.  While closeups do not show skin pores or that much detail, primarily detail is scene on clothing and objects.  I didn't notice any banding issues or artifacts.  Overall, skintones are natural, black levels are very good and picture quality is great!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" is presented in Cantonese and English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and is presented with English subtitles. As all Asian films that I watch, I prefer not to watch the English dub track but for those who prefer it, there is an English dub track included and the fact that FUNimation is well-known for their voice actors that they hire, I would think that fans of these English voice actors should have no problem with them.I will say that the lossless audio track was not as immersive as I would have liked.  But while there are plenty of action sequences in this film, it's not like the previous ""Ip Man"" films which tend to sound more immersive.  The action sequences do sound good and are effective during the action sequences but these moments are not as long as I would have hoped.But overall, the the lossless audio track features crystal clear dialogue, music and action sequences when it is featured onscreen.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Legend is Born: Ip Many"" comes with the following special features:Making of - (13:21) Behind the scenes footage and interviews with the cast.Theatrical Trailer - (1:58) The original theatrical trailers for ""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"".EXTRAS:""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" comes with a DVD version of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:I loved Donnie Yen's first ""Ip Man"" film, the second was OK and despite this film not being related to the other two and is more about Ip Man's earlier life, I would have to say that this film is primarily a popcorn action film.There are lot of liberties taken with Ip Man's life and unless you do the research, some people may think he actually had a half-brother and that what they are seeing onscreen is biographical.  But the truth is that there are fictional moments that are presented around Ip Man's non-fictional life as a young man learning Wing Chun, that I often wonder how he would feel if he was alive today and see how writers really distorted his life for the sake of entertainment.Granted, the film does feature Ip Man's son, Ip Chun which was great!  And I can only hope that the estate of Ip Man are getting paid well with all these ""Ip Man"" related stories and I don't think that there will be an end to these stories anytime soon.  They make money and people all over the world love the martial arts action that comes along with these films.But while I did enjoy ""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"", as a guy who loves to research the lives of these individuals that these movies are based on.  I now wonder how much of what is featured in this film is actually truth.  We know that Ip Man studied under Chan Wah-shun and when he died, Ng. Chung-sok took over.  It is documented that he studied in Hong Kong and learned alternate forms of Wing Chun from Leung Bik.But other than that, we know that he had a brother but not this half-brother that was featured in the film.  Was there a real Mei Wai?  Did Ip Man meet his wife at a market?  To tell you the truth, I'm not sure what is fiction and what is non-fiction in this film aside from the training from his two masters.And personally, I just hope there is not a constant number of films that are released and continue to distort the true story of his life.  If anything, I hope that people are smart enough to know that ""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" is completely accurate.Outside of that, I will say that the casting of Dennis To is fantastic.  I know the director has made it clear that this film is not a prequel to the previous two films but I have to admit, Dennis To looks like a younger version of Donnie Yen.  And for anyone watching this film, they will think that this film is an actual prequel to the other two films because of that.  Also, casting Sammo Hung and Fan Siu-wong who starred in the Donnie Yen ""Ip Man"" films also makes things a bit interesting.As for the Blu-ray release, you get the making of and trailers.  Picture quality is very good and the lossless soundtrack is also very good but not too immersive.Overall, ""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" is an entertaining popcorn action, martial arts film but it's also another film that distorts the life of the actual man.  Throwing in a fight against Japanese dressed as ninjas is becoming a bit too farfetched and more Shaw Brothers-like than any other ""Ip Man"" film before it. But I do understand that as long as these ""Ip Man"" films continue to be made, it does well in the box office.""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" continues the action but showcases Ip Man during the time of his earlier teenage years.  If you are looking for a martial arts film to sit back and enjoy without wanting to learn about the actual history of the man who taught Bruce Lee, then definitely give this film a try!",3,"Blu-ray

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","THE LEGEND IS BORN: IP MAN, a/k/a IP MAN 'ZERO' (2010, original title ""Yip Man chinchyun"", hope that helps) a/k/a IP MAN: THE LEGEND IS BORN, IP MAN 3 and really any darned variation on those you can imagine. And wouldn't you know it, here I've found yet ANOTHER titled edition of this same film, though the box just shows one of the other titles. Yet it is a grand film and I loved it.It really is very good. Not being able to find one single fault with it - I never expected it to be a realistic Wing Chun tutorial, it's a drama, people - it does a truly adequate job of taking us back to Ip Man's youth and early adulthood. In the wayIp Mantook us through his wealthy years/downfall, andIP Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster (English Subtitled)took us with him to Hong Kong for a whole new struggle, this film takes us through his early years. Very effective, and I don't care what the whiny babies say about the fight scenes.Don't expect a history of Wing Chun or accurate biographical data on Master Ip. For a good biography you need to read the awesome but slenderIp Man - Portrait of a Kung Fu Master(see my review).This is of course never on the grand scale of the 1st or 2nd films, but how can anyone really criticize it? It is good! I LOVED the appearance of Ip Man's real-life son Master Ip Chun as Master Leung Bik - so charming, innocent and effective. The man is a born actor as long as he isn't forced to read from cue cards! And his fighting was awesome. ""Whatever comes from my hands is Wing Chun!"" he growls at young Ip Man.Amen, Sifu. Though this is also skinny on the facts, well, so were the other films. This is drama Chinese-style. God, even history Chinese style is mostly drama and little fact! Truth is, the acting is good, the settings are great, Yu Hang To (""Dennis"" To) plays a wonderful Ip Man without impersonating Donnie Yen, and they capture the atmosphere of the era. I loved seeing Ip Man at that Catholic school he attended.If there are two major complaints I have about the film, it is the very short cameo of Sammo Hung as Master Chan Wah Shun, Ip Man's 1st and oft-mentioned teacher. He drops dead of a heart attack near the beginning, and, well, what can I say .... The other thing: why so many familiar faces from the first two films here? It is bad enough that Sammo looks and dresses exactly like when he played Master Hung in IP MAN 2!There are many treats here in any case. They filmed at the actual Association in Hong Kong, and the director had a nice cameo role as the original ""chairman"" of the Wing Chun ""Association"" - in other words, as he says in an interview, he plays the man who once 80 years earlier held his job.DVD WARNING!! - My original copy, admittedly different-looking from this edition, did not function properly about halfway through the film. I suspect, based on past experience, that 'the whole batch' is probably this bad. This new copy plays fine ... for now. But it is as like to self-destruct as my copy of the originalIp Man.Therefore no matter which DVD edition you buy, you are really in a lottery as to whether it will play properly or not. I had to send mine back, and sadly didn't get an exchange but a refund. My wife and I both suspect this is being done deliberately, the manufacturing of ""time-bomb"" DVDs. After 6 months or even as late as three years later, they begin stalling, freezing, tiling and one day finally die.Do not think the film or transfer itself is bad in any way. It's the execrable DVD voodoo that causes the disc to freeze up the entire player. I couldn't get my tv/dvd player to do a thing except let itself shut off when the dvd froze in there. That is BAD business!The really bad vibe with this is the plethora of different titles, which I suspect are coming from someplace dark. ""False economy"" comes to mind when I experience this type of thing. Several reviewers have said this looks like a rotten VHS tape bootleg. Neither of my copies looked that way at all, yet the 1st copy I had jammed my DVD players just the same. Caveat emptor with ALL the IP MAN series. I have a feeling it is never going to be fixed, and I do not like crapshoots even with great films.... and I will warn the viewer about the rotten thing that just happened to me: my copy of the originalIp Manwhich always played perfectly well, just went on the fritz. It began freezing in the player and refused to play right.I've seen this only one other time in my life, getting a perfectly good DVD copy then having it fail like that years later. It is NOT the DVD player because we have more than one, so we can test DVDs. However, what is happening here is, as I said, the DVDs are failing a long time after you've enjoyed them several times with no problems.The buyer must be REALLY wary when getting any of the IP MAN series.One other thing: we need to start mentioning the Amazon seller when we buy a copy and review. For example, if anything goes wrong at least I can say in this review that I bought this DVD directly from Amazon.Whether bought from Amazon or some other seller here, it might help pin down the sellers who don't seem to have problems with their copies. That may sound like a bit of a magic trick but it is known as ""statistics"". And if there are bootlegs, which is not unusual on Amazon, let us put an end to those right now by reporting them.",4,"IP MAN 3 OR ZERO, THE LEGEND OF THE POSSIBLY GRAND MASTER WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE

1382394,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0041YI4ZO,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[6, 9]","True story: I was first put on to the whole Ip Man series by an online friend who told me that I absolutely had to see the films because ""they're like a cross between SCHINDLER'S LIST and ENTER THE DRAGON!""  While I found the comparison more than a little off-kilter, I did see the first film, simply titled IP MAN.  It was released in 2008, and it told the story of Yip Man, a grandmaster of Wing Chun martial arts and - as I learned - the man who trained the legendary Bruce Lee.  (So I finally understood the comparison!)  It was a fascinating story - with incomparable fight scenes - set against the Second Sino-Japanese War.  It starred Donnie Yen as Ip Man, and, to date, it spawned one sequel which also starred Yen, but now ""the legend is born"" again in IP MAN: THE LEGEND IS BORN with newcomer Dennis To taking the central role as a much younger Ip.(For the record, it's worth noting that the first IP MAN was nominated for 12 awards at the 28th Hong Kong Film Awards, so, yes, it's quite good, fighting and all.)LEGEND revisits Ip Man's story by transporting the viewers back to the man's youth.  This new installment follows the young man as he begins to understand his fighting prowess.  In a town ripe with political corruption, the younger Ip Man sees all that he stands for threatened, so he stands up alone against these local `forces of evil' to protect his temple and his honor.  While this earlier film only hints at the charged political situation between Japan and China that takes center seat in IP MAN and (I'm told) IP MAN 2, I can say with some assurance that you needn't have to see the earlier films to appreciate the story here; there's enough background provided so that LEGEND can be a comfortable `jumping on' point for anyone.However, that's perhaps what I missed between the first IP MAN and this reborn LEGEND.  The first film had a clear villain for the grandmaster's conflict.  When the audience understands the source of the conflict, it's much easier to appreciate how the narrative unfolds.  Ip's ""adversary"" isn't as clear in this film, and, at times, I found that a bit of a distraction.  It's a much different story - one without as direct a requirement to showcase the man's fighting philosophy and skills.  That doesn't make it a ""lesser"" picture in any measure; it's just that some of the ""history"" felt a bit more dramatically contrived than perhaps it was based on the circumstances of Ip's later life.Sure, there's fighting, but one of the fight scenes (a racist Westerner insults Ip Man at a field hockey match) feels inauthentic, though it very well may've happened.  There's a bit of love triange - almost a quadrangle, if you will - but it gets resolved a bit too predictably and formulaically, a sin to many period-based romances, to seem fully legitimate.  When the film's true adversary is hidden - I don't want to reveal much because I think it fairly ""spoilerish"", suffice it to say that spies of a certain nature are definitely involved - it's sometimes unclear who Ip Man's real allies are here.  Thankfully, it's still told with much of the same flair as Donnie Yen's earlier contributions, and newcomer To almost seamlessly steps into these younger shoes with similar styling and physical charisma to the central role.  In fact, it's amazing and refreshing to see such physical grace onscreen these days when so much of the filmmaking process has been reduced to post-production special effects.The picture quality is excellent, the choreography is mind-blowingly incredible, and the production detail is superb.  The disc comes with a ""making of"" feature that could've benefitted from greater direction, but that's a small quibble.  What's real movie magic here is the story - the exploration of a key figure in the mastery of Wing Chun against the backdrop of history - and the film certainly succeeds on that level.Highly recommended.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the film folks at FUNimation provided me with a copy of the DVD for the purposes of completing this review.",4,Ip Man's LEGEND Is Reborn,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,4064,"['True', 'story', 'was', 'first', 'put', 'whole', 'Ip', 'Man', 'series', 'online', 'friend', 'who', 'told', 'absolutely', 'had', 'see', 'films', ""'re"", 'cross', 'SCHINDLER', 'LIST', 'ENTER', 'THE', 'DRAGON', 'found', 'comparison', 'more', 'little', 'off-kilter', 'did', 'see', 'first', 'film', 'simply', 'titled', 'IP', 'MAN', 'was', 'released', '2008', 'told', 'story', 'Yip', 'Man', 'grandmaster', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'martial', 'arts', 'learned', 'man', 'who', 'trained', 'legendary', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'finally', 'understood', 'comparison', 'was', 'fascinating', 'story', 'incomparable', 'fight', 'scenes', 'set', 'Second', 'Sino-Japanese', 'War', 'starred', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'Ip', 'Man', 'date', 'spawned', 'one', 'sequel', 'also', 'starred', 'Yen', 'now', 'legend', 'born', 'again', 'IP', 'MAN', 'LEGEND', 'IS', 'BORN', 'newcomer', 'Dennis', 'taking', 'central', 'role', 'much', 'younger', 'Ip', 'record', 'worth', 'noting', 'first', 'IP', 'MAN', 'was', 'nominated', '12', 'awards', '28th', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Film', 'Awards', 'so', 'yes', 'quite', 'good', 'fighting', 'LEGEND', 'Ip', 'Man', 'story', 'transporting', 'viewers', 'back', 'man', 'youth', 'new', 'installment', 'young', 'man', 'understand', 'fighting', 'prowess', 'town', 'ripe', 'political', 'corruption', 'younger', 'Ip', 'Man', 'threatened', 'up', 'alone', 'local', 'forces', 'evil', 'protect', 'temple', 'honor', 'earlier', 'film', 'only', 'charged', 'political', 'situation', 'Japan', 'China', 'center', 'seat', 'IP', 'MAN', ""'m"", 'told', 'IP', 'MAN', '2', 'can', 'say', 'assurance', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'earlier', 'films', 'appreciate', 'story', 'here', 'enough', 'background', 'provided', 'so', 'LEGEND', 'can', 'be', 'comfortable', 'jumping', 'point', 'anyone.However', 'perhaps', 'what', 'missed', 'first', 'IP', 'MAN', 'reborn', 'LEGEND', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'clear', 'villain', 'grandmaster', 'conflict', 'When', 'audience', 'source', 'conflict', 'much', 'easier', 'appreciate', 'how', 'narrative', 'unfolds', 'Ip', 'adversary', ""n't"", 'clear', 'film', 'times', 'found', 'bit', 'distraction', 'much', 'different', 'story', 'one', 'direct', 'requirement', 'showcase', 'man', 'fighting', 'philosophy', 'skills', ""n't"", 'make', 'lesser', 'picture', 'measure', 'just', 'history', 'felt', 'bit', 'more', 'dramatically', 'contrived', 'perhaps', 'was', 'based', 'circumstances', 'Ip', 'later', 'life.Sure', 'fighting', 'one', 'fight', 'scenes', 'racist', 'Westerner', 'insults', 'Ip', 'Man', 'field', 'hockey', 'match', 'inauthentic', 'very', 'well', 'may', ""'ve"", 'happened', 'bit', 'love', 'triange', 'almost', 'quadrangle', 'will', 'resolved', 'bit', 'too', 'predictably', 'formulaically', 'sin', 'many', 'period-based', 'romances', 'seem', 'fully', 'legitimate', 'When', 'film', 'true', 'adversary', 'hidden', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'much', 'think', 'fairly', 'spoilerish', 'say', 'spies', 'certain', 'nature', 'are', 'definitely', 'involved', 'sometimes', 'unclear', 'who', 'Ip', 'Man', 'real', 'allies', 'are', 'here', 'Thankfully', 'still', 'told', 'much', 'same', 'flair', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'earlier', 'contributions', 'newcomer', 'almost', 'seamlessly', 'steps', 'younger', 'shoes', 'similar', 'styling', 'physical', 'charisma', 'central', 'role', 'fact', 'amazing', 'refreshing', 'see', 'such', 'physical', 'grace', 'days', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'been', 'reduced', 'post-production', 'special', 'effects.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'choreography', 'mind-blowingly', 'incredible', 'production', 'detail', 'superb', 'disc', 'making', 'feature', 'could', ""'ve"", 'benefitted', 'greater', 'direction', 'small', 'quibble', 'What', 'real', 'movie', 'magic', 'here', 'story', 'exploration', 'key', 'figure', 'mastery', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'backdrop', 'history', 'film', 'certainly', 'level.Highly', 'interests', 'fairness', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'disclose', 'film', 'folks', 'FUNimation', 'provided', 'copy', 'DVD', 'purposes', 'completing', 'review']",N/A

This movie has it all -- martial arts  training as a disciple, the challenge from different schools (in this case a misnomer, as the challenge actually comes from the Japanese), the defence of Chinese pride against disrespectful foreigners, love, betrayal, intrigue, and an historically accurate spy story thrown in.The story revolves around the lives of two boys, one the son of a rich man and the other an adopted son whom their father had found abandoned in the blind downpour of rain; and as the movie proceeds, they are introduced to the grand master of Wing Chun, Chan Wah Shun, portrayed by Samo Hung in a cameo appearance, who passes away within an extremely short span of time. Then, the story turns to Ip Man leaving Foshan for Hong Kong to pursue tertiary education and sees him defending the Chinese against foreign aggressors, by the way of a British teen who calls the Chinese pigs during a football match, and having challenged the foreigner, who further insults the Chinese by calling them the sick old man of Asia, they engage in a duel that sees Ip Man breaking the foreigners hand, and having taught the British a lesson through that feat, sets the bone straight again. Following this encounter Ip Man's reputation in Hong Kong grows and, searching for medication for his new found friend, the foreigner, Ip enters a Chinese medicine shop where he is challenged and badly humiliated by Leung Bik, played by Ip Chun - the real life son of Ip Man, who had broken away from the traditional school of Wing Chun as founded by his family, thereby, cementing a conflict with his brothers Ng' Chung So and Chen Wa Shun, who are considered the orthodox school of Wing Chun; and, having been so humiliated, accepts Leung Bik as his master and begins training as Leung Bik's disciple. When he returns to Foshan, he demonstrates and proves the superiority of Leung Bik's style over traditional Wing Chun and is punished by his master, played by Yuen Biao, who had taken over the reins from Chan Wah Shun.Meanwhile, the Japanese have challenged Yuen Biao's school, and having been defeated by the Ip Man's adopted brother, who we will later be made to realize was a Japanese agent who had been sent to Foshan as a child to infiltrate Chinese society so that the Japanese could further their imperial ambitions in China, seeks to convince Yuen Biao's school to accept the Japanese as disciples.The movie culminates with Ip's adopted brother finally being made ,by the Japanese, to slaughter everyone at Yuen Biao's school of martial arts, and the climactic battle between the two which is one of the most exhilarating fight sequences you will ever see on film.Highly recommended.",5,Wushu Masterpiece,1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,3163,"['Tracing', 'legend', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'master', 'Ip', 'Man', 'back', 'beginnings', 'Foshan', 'China', 'Ip', 'Man', 'Legend', 'Born', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'grandmaster', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'played', '2010', 'World', 'Wushu', 'Champion', 'Dennis', 'best', 'martial', 'arts', 'choreography', 'ever', 'captured', 'screen', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'ranking', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'time', 'also', 'incorporating', 'what', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'deemed', 'one', 'best', 'five', 'story', 'lines', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'movie', 'martial', 'arts', 'training', 'disciple', 'challenge', 'different', 'schools', 'case', 'misnomer', 'challenge', 'actually', 'Japanese', 'defence', 'Chinese', 'pride', 'disrespectful', 'foreigners', 'love', 'betrayal', 'intrigue', 'historically', 'accurate', 'spy', 'story', 'in.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'lives', 'two', 'boys', 'one', 'son', 'rich', 'man', 'other', 'adopted', 'son', 'whom', 'father', 'had', 'found', 'abandoned', 'blind', 'downpour', 'rain', 'movie', 'proceeds', 'are', 'introduced', 'grand', 'master', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'Chan', 'Wah', 'Shun', 'portrayed', 'Samo', 'Hung', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'who', 'away', 'extremely', 'short', 'span', 'time', 'Then', 'story', 'Ip', 'Man', 'leaving', 'Foshan', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'pursue', 'tertiary', 'education', 'defending', 'Chinese', 'foreign', 'aggressors', 'way', 'British', 'teen', 'who', 'Chinese', 'pigs', 'football', 'match', 'having', 'challenged', 'foreigner', 'who', 'further', 'insults', 'Chinese', 'calling', 'sick', 'old', 'man', 'Asia', 'engage', 'duel', 'Ip', 'Man', 'breaking', 'foreigners', 'hand', 'having', 'taught', 'British', 'lesson', 'feat', 'bone', 'straight', 'again', 'Following', 'encounter', 'Ip', 'Man', 'reputation', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'grows', 'searching', 'medication', 'new', 'found', 'friend', 'foreigner', 'Ip', 'Chinese', 'medicine', 'shop', 'where', 'challenged', 'badly', 'humiliated', 'Leung', 'Bik', 'played', 'Ip', 'Chun', 'real', 'life', 'son', 'Ip', 'Man', 'who', 'had', 'broken', 'away', 'traditional', 'school', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'founded', 'family', 'thereby', 'cementing', 'conflict', 'brothers', 'Ng', 'Chung', 'So', 'Chen', 'Wa', 'Shun', 'who', 'are', 'considered', 'orthodox', 'school', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'having', 'been', 'so', 'humiliated', 'accepts', 'Leung', 'Bik', 'master', 'training', 'Leung', 'Bik', 'disciple', 'When', 'Foshan', 'superiority', 'Leung', 'Bik', 'style', 'traditional', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'punished', 'master', 'played', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'who', 'had', 'taken', 'over', 'reins', 'Chan', 'Wah', 'Shun.Meanwhile', 'Japanese', 'have', 'challenged', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'school', 'having', 'been', 'defeated', 'Ip', 'Man', 'adopted', 'brother', 'who', 'will', 'later', 'be', 'made', 'realize', 'was', 'Japanese', 'agent', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'sent', 'Foshan', 'child', 'infiltrate', 'Chinese', 'society', 'Japanese', 'could', 'further', 'imperial', 'ambitions', 'China', 'convince', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'school', 'accept', 'Japanese', 'disciples.The', 'movie', 'culminates', 'Ip', 'adopted', 'brother', 'finally', 'being', 'made', 'Japanese', 'slaughter', 'everyone', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'school', 'martial', 'arts', 'climactic', 'battle', 'two', 'one', 'most', 'exhilarating', 'fight', 'sequences', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'film.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

1382410,A3QTB346UKG6TV,B0041YI4ZO,Mantis,"[2, 3]","This is a PREQUEL to the Wilson Yip directed 2-part biography of the Wing Chun wizard Ip Man, which starred Donnie Yen, with choreography by Sammo Hung (""The Victim"") and Tony Leung Siu-Hung (""Bloodmoon"").  This film replaces Yen with Dennis To (""Bodyguards and Assassins"") and the director's chair is now filled by Herman Yau (the ""Troublesome Night"" series), with Mr. Leung Siu-Hung (who sat out ""Ip Man 2"") now teaming with Checkley Sin Kwok-Lam to stage the fights.  Several of the cast members from the first two films have different roles in this, including Sammo and Fan Siu Wong (""Story of Ricky"").Ip Man is a young teen in the very early 1900s when his father sends him and his adopted brother Tin Chi (Fan Siu Wong) to study Wing Chun with Chan Wah Shun (Hung) in the city of Foshan.  When the Master falls terminally ill, he asks Ng Chung So (Yuen Biao, ""Dragons Forever"") to oversee the school.  Man and Tin Chi grow into respectful and dedicated students and Man briefly leaves Foshan for scholastic studies in Hong Kong, where he learns a few amended moves from his deceased master's disgraced former-student Leung Bik (Ip Chan, son of the actual Ip Man).  When he returns he'll have to deal with jealousy, love, tenacity and the Japanese.This is not a bad movie at all but much of it registers a little flat.  Dennis To does an okay job as actor but had little experience prior to this film and I certainly look forward to seeing him in more stuff.  Otherwise silly situations and dialogue marr the film's overall presentation but if you were watching for the fights then you shouldn't be too disappointed.  Plenty of fast exchanges with minimal wirework that's only used to SLIGHTLY exaggerate a move or recovery and for that I say ""thank you!""  I must mention that I normally find it excruciating when movies like this show an older gentleman trying to best a young fella but here it actually works.  Ip Chan was at least 85 when this film was made and while you wouldn't expect him to single-handedly clean out a bar filled with sailors, his athleticism is nonetheless impressive.  It was also nice to see Yuen Biao again as his movie appearances seem to occur with decreasing frequency.The history of Wing Chun seems to be a fascinating subject to Sammo Hung as I've seen 5 movies that attempt to depict the art and he has been involved with all of them.  It's assumed that his interest blossomed via his friendship with Bruce Lee as Mr. Lee was a student of Ip Man. Prior to his work on the ""Ip Man"" franchise, Hung directed and starred in the non-sequential ""Warriors Two"" (1978) and ""The Prodigal Son"" (1981).  ""Warriors Two"" featured Cassanova Wong as the Cashier (or Banker) Wah, the same character depicted by Sammo in this film.  ""The Prodigal Son"" featured Yuen Biao as Leung Chang (played in ""Warriors Two by Leung Kar Yan), the man who would go on to teach Cashier Wah.  The art before that is a bit of a mystery but it originated from a Shaolin nun who blended the Snake & Crane styles specifically for female student Yim Wing Chun, who went on to marry (and teach) a man whose surname was Leung.The National Arts/Mei Ah/Eleven Arts/Funimation DVD has a very fine widescreen picture with spoken languages available in English or Cantonese.  Subtitles only available in English.  Special features consist of a ""making of"" segment and some trailers.  This is not a bad film and has better-than-average fights but I'm not sure how heartily I can recommend it.  I think it's arguably better than part 2 but inferior to part 1.  As much as I historically love Chinese film, this almost gets an extra star just for NOT being epic wire-fu!  3.5 out of 5.2010",3,The Profit Continues: Ip Man,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,3681,"['PREQUEL', 'Wilson', 'Yip', 'directed', '2-part', 'biography', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'wizard', 'Ip', 'Man', 'starred', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'choreography', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'Victim', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Siu-Hung', 'Bloodmoon', 'film', 'Yen', 'Dennis', 'Bodyguards', 'Assassins', 'director', 'chair', 'now', 'filled', 'Herman', 'Yau', 'Troublesome', 'Night', 'series', 'Mr.', 'Leung', 'Siu-Hung', 'who', 'sat', 'out', 'Ip', 'Man', '2', 'now', 'teaming', 'Checkley', 'Sin', 'Kwok-Lam', 'stage', 'fights', 'Several', 'cast', 'members', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'have', 'different', 'roles', 'including', 'Sammo', 'Fan', 'Siu', 'Wong', 'Story', 'Ricky', '.Ip', 'Man', 'young', 'teen', 'very', 'early', '1900s', 'when', 'father', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Tin', 'Chi', 'Fan', 'Siu', 'Wong', 'study', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'Chan', 'Wah', 'Shun', 'Hung', 'city', 'Foshan', 'When', 'Master', 'terminally', 'ill', 'Ng', 'Chung', 'So', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'Dragons', 'Forever', 'oversee', 'school', 'Man', 'Tin', 'Chi', 'grow', 'respectful', 'dedicated', 'students', 'Man', 'briefly', 'Foshan', 'scholastic', 'studies', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'where', 'few', 'amended', 'moves', 'deceased', 'master', 'disgraced', 'former-student', 'Leung', 'Bik', 'Ip', 'Chan', 'son', 'actual', 'Ip', 'Man', 'When', ""'ll"", 'have', 'deal', 'jealousy', 'love', 'tenacity', 'Japanese.This', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'much', 'little', 'flat', 'Dennis', 'okay', 'job', 'actor', 'had', 'little', 'experience', 'prior', 'film', 'certainly', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'stuff', 'Otherwise', 'silly', 'situations', 'dialogue', 'marr', 'film', 'overall', 'presentation', 'were', 'watching', 'fights', 'then', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'disappointed', 'Plenty', 'fast', 'exchanges', 'minimal', 'wirework', 'only', 'used', 'SLIGHTLY', 'exaggerate', 'move', 'recovery', 'say', 'thank', 'must', 'mention', 'normally', 'find', 'excruciating', 'when', 'movies', 'show', 'older', 'gentleman', 'trying', 'best', 'young', 'fella', 'here', 'actually', 'Ip', 'Chan', 'was', 'least', '85', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'single-handedly', 'clean', 'out', 'bar', 'filled', 'sailors', 'athleticism', 'nonetheless', 'impressive', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'again', 'movie', 'appearances', 'seem', 'occur', 'decreasing', 'frequency.The', 'history', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'be', 'fascinating', 'subject', 'Sammo', 'Hung', ""'ve"", 'seen', '5', 'movies', 'attempt', 'depict', 'art', 'been', 'involved', 'assumed', 'interest', 'blossomed', 'friendship', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'was', 'student', 'Ip', 'Man', 'Prior', 'work', 'Ip', 'Man', 'franchise', 'Hung', 'directed', 'starred', 'non-sequential', 'Warriors', 'Two', '1978', 'Prodigal', 'Son', '1981', 'Warriors', 'Two', 'featured', 'Cassanova', 'Wong', 'Cashier', 'Banker', 'Wah', 'same', 'character', 'depicted', 'Sammo', 'film', 'Prodigal', 'Son', 'featured', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'Leung', 'Chang', 'played', 'Warriors', 'Two', 'Leung', 'Kar', 'Yan', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'teach', 'Cashier', 'Wah', 'art', 'bit', 'mystery', 'originated', 'Shaolin', 'nun', 'who', 'blended', 'Snake', 'Crane', 'specifically', 'female', 'student', 'Yim', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'who', 'went', 'marry', 'teach', 'man', 'surname', 'was', 'Leung.The', 'National', 'Arts/Mei', 'Ah/Eleven', 'Arts/Funimation', 'DVD', 'very', 'fine', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'spoken', 'languages', 'available', 'English', 'Cantonese', 'Subtitles', 'only', 'available', 'English', 'Special', 'features', 'consist', 'making', 'segment', 'trailers', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'better-than-average', 'fights', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'heartily', 'can', 'recommend', 'think', 'arguably', 'better', 'part', '2', 'inferior', 'part', '1', 'As', 'much', 'historically', 'love', 'Chinese', 'film', 'almost', 'extra', 'star', 'just', 'NOT', 'being', 'epic', 'wire-fu', '3.5', '5.2010']",N/A

There is plenty of martial arts skill on display here too, so genre fans shouldn't be disappointed in that. However, a lot of it is simply sparring, or dealing with local bullies, and there's never really that adrenaline-pumping feeling that anything's really at stake for Ip Man.The story does try to insert the drama that will liven up the fight scenes, but it's all hammered into the final act without any build up or tension. However, if you do turn off your brain entirely, the action scenes are entertaining enough to keep Legend is Born from being an abomination, if not a memorable martial arts thrill ride.In the end, Legend is Born is entertaining enough for action fans.

You are kidding yourself if you believe that Sammo Hung Kam-bo is going to appear in anything less than a Grade A movie. Just like any great American actor, why would he? Ip Chun, the real-life eldest son of Ip Man appears in the movie as one of historical sifus his father trained under. The story line is set before the Ip Man story line and deals with a young Ip Man (Yu Hang-To, who looks just like a young Donnie Yen) learning Wing Chun from three different sifu. The special effects and martial arts scenes are entriguing, but remember this is a historical piece about a real master of a real art, not fantasy martial arts. So if you are looking for people soaring through trees and fighting on water, best to rent Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The sets are beautiful and if you are a lover of all things Chinese you will be entralled with the very essence of this movie. I saw it in Cantonese with no sub-titles and then with English subs. Even without the subs the gist of the story was easy to follow. Ip Man is critical to the martial arts explosion of the seventies as his lessons shaped Bruce Lee's vision of martial arts, his own system, Jeet Kune Do, and ultimately his ability to capture the world's attention.

1382426,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0041YI4ZO,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","An ""Ip Man"" film without Donnie Yen? You may be thinking such a project will end up with terrible results. In fact, flawed as it is, ""Ip Man: The Legend is Born"" is not that bad, thanks to the capable cast including Dennis To and Fan Siu-wong, as well as supports from familiar faces from Hong Kong cinema such as Yuen Biao, Lam Suet and Sammo Hung in a cameo role.In ""Ip Man: The Legend is Born,"" Dennis To (also known as Yu-Hang To) plays the legendary martial arts fighter and master of Bruce Lee. The film chronicles his young days in early 20th century Foshan, where he meets his future wife Cheung Wing-shing (Huang Yi), and Hong Kong, where he learns a new fighting style from another Wing Chun master (played by Ip Chun, Ip Man's real-life son).Dennis To (with physical resemblance to Donnie Yen) is credible as young Ip Man. Action sequences are competent, but not as innovative as those of other two ""Ip Man"" movies starring Donnie Yen, who always adds something new to the choreography. One exception is a brief but impressive sparring scene by Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao (both blindfolded), but the rest of the martial arts stunts lacks style or power Donnie Yen might have brought in.The story is weak and sometimes incomprehensible, and the production design looks not very authentic. I don't mind these things anyway because what I want is action. ""Ip Man: The Legend is Born"" tries its best, but after our watching the two Donnie Yen features, the new film's action is just adequate.",3,(3.5 STARS) Just OK with Some Nice Action Scenes,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,1497,"['Ip', 'Man', 'film', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'may', 'be', 'thinking', 'such', 'project', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'terrible', 'results', 'fact', 'flawed', 'Ip', 'Man', 'Legend', 'Born', 'not', 'bad', 'thanks', 'capable', 'cast', 'including', 'Dennis', 'Fan', 'Siu-wong', 'as', 'well', 'supports', 'familiar', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'cinema', 'such', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'Lam', 'Suet', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'cameo', 'role.In', 'Ip', 'Man', 'Legend', 'Born', 'Dennis', 'also', 'known', 'Yu-Hang', 'legendary', 'martial', 'arts', 'fighter', 'master', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'film', 'young', 'days', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'Foshan', 'where', 'future', 'wife', 'Cheung', 'Wing-shing', 'Huang', 'Yi', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'where', 'new', 'fighting', 'style', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'master', 'played', 'Ip', 'Chun', 'Ip', 'Man', 'real-life', 'son', '.Dennis', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'credible', 'young', 'Ip', 'Man', 'Action', 'sequences', 'are', 'competent', 'not', 'as', 'innovative', 'other', 'two', 'Ip', 'Man', 'movies', 'starring', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'who', 'always', 'something', 'new', 'choreography', 'One', 'exception', 'brief', 'impressive', 'sparring', 'scene', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'blindfolded', 'rest', 'martial', 'arts', 'stunts', 'style', 'power', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'might', 'have', 'brought', 'in.The', 'story', 'weak', 'sometimes', 'incomprehensible', 'production', 'design', 'not', 'very', 'authentic', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'things', 'anyway', 'what', 'want', 'action', 'Ip', 'Man', 'Legend', 'Born', 'best', 'watching', 'two', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'features', 'new', 'film', 'action', 'just', 'adequate']",N/A

I have seen Daniel (Yu-Hang) To in the other Ip Man movies (Ip Man, Ip Man 2, both are excellent movies) and he did a solid job in those movies with smaller roles. I was a bit surprised to see him as the main featured actor in a role as Ip Man but he does a very good job, both with humility and pride. I appreciate the fact this movie focuses on the development / advancement of Wing Chun, portrayed by Ip Chung, an ""authentic"" Wing Chun practitioner and son of the actual Ip Man. Ip Chung plays the role of Leung Bik and portrays him well for the brief amount of time he appears on screen.Like the previous Donnie Yen featured Ip Man movies, The Legend Is Born centers on the Japanese invasion of China, and the response of the Chinese people. There are civil wars as well as struggles to unify China versus Japan. The martial arts action is quite good, intentionally amusing at various times, and not over the top with their usage of wires for some of the stunts.
