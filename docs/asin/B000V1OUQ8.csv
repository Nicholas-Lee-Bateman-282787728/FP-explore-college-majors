This is the way the rock guitar was meant to be played, not too fast just a killer sound and monster licks baby!!  The video and audio quality is also top notch.  I give this my highest recommendation. I have all the Ash dvd's and while they are all good this is by far the best if for no other reason than Muddy is amazing!!",5,Great show Great dvd !!,1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,449,"['What', 'great', 'band', 'Andy', 'put', 'together', 'Muddy', 'second', 'lead', 'guitar', 'fantastic', 'featured', 'wonderfully', 'way', 'rock', 'guitar', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'played', 'not', 'too', 'fast', 'just', 'killer', 'sound', 'monster', 'licks', 'baby', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'give', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'have', 'Ash', 'dvd', 'are', 'good', 'far', 'best', 'other', 'reason', 'Muddy', 'amazing']",N/A

You don't need to listen to this concert in 5.1 Surround Sound (Dolby or DTS) to fully appreciate this amazing show. Wishbone Ash is a legend, even with only one original member.
