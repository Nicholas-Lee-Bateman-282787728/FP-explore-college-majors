1263696,A286XNXOREIVWW,B002DLB184,ANJANI W.,"[0, 0]","Decent acting. Moody cinematography. Mostly shadows...all colors dark brown and sepia toned. A priest searches for a suicidal girl on the seedy side of town. Don't look to get your jollies. The seedy side of town, in one instance, looks like a Peets Coffee shop. The priest stares out at the dark sinful streets. I'm making fun here because this movie is just okay. The best part was hoping to see Kristin Chenoweth do her thing. That ain't gonna happen in this film. But it did make smile and almost laugh aloud in the first ten minutes. It's quirky. The characters are unique and have depth. The story is so think it ends with a fade to black. Important question never answered. I spent the day watching artful moody films. (I kid you not.) I watched three films in a row that end in..er...um...mystery? A poor excuse for a mediocre script. Each of these films used this tactic. I like a film that makes me think. But pulling the plug without rewarding the viewer with an answer to a key plot question is just mean. Tacky and mean. I can't give it two stars...it was a little better than that. Worth your time?

The story is heartbreakingly real and explicates a long hidden social issue and problem prevalent, but never spoken about even in Parish affairs.  This is the elephant in the living room!  Sad beyond measure and so realistically portrayed and acted, that my sense of it brought tears to my eyes.  I am not gonna give away the story!  It is a sensitive drama about a real life situation.  I think children would not be up to seeing this.  It is a mature story for adults who have some knowledge of Catholic teaching, theology, the sacraments, and ritual.

In this instance it probably was needed to show the crassness of the environment, the pain of the situations that the people living in the dark live in. It made me uncomfortable, but it was not much.Basically, you see a poor child at communion. It is obvious she is not well taken care of.Then the story cuts to a priest doing confessions, and a woman comes in and tells him her awful life story, and that she is going to kill herself. It seems that the priest overwhelmed by the thought of this woman killing herself in a week, did not address her need for confessing all of this...to try to wash herself clean of the pain and guilt.  And either this, or his empathy, or ethics, or humanity set him trying to find this woman who was anonymous to him, having only seen the crucifix she wore through the mesh of the confessional and that she was young, and that she moves in the underbelly of society.He tries to search for her in these places. When you hear confession, you can not say what was confessed; so he can't say why he is looking for this woman...and the &#34;people&#34; assume the worst for the most part. He is beat up, humiliated, afraid; but keeps on trying to find this woman to help her.  And as such, basically resembles the journey of Christ as he wades through the mire, afraid, humiliated, and beat up for us...trying to help us. AND what he calls each of us to do for others.While the priest is the main character, we see humanity in the sampling of the people around him, and interacting with him. And we see the prostitute try to come to some resolution about her anger, hate, abandonment, loneliness, and greatness of her own spirit (which maybe she never sees, but those watching may.)We don't know if he saves her...but we know the good he does along the path of trying to save her has a rippling effect, like a pebble thrown into a pond...so much so that even these pebbles reach her. What we see in this film is a person trying to do right, trying to avoid temptation to ignore other's pain or need or even one's own desires; and just like watching a person jumping off the diving board makes those of us who wish to dive think.&#34;maybe I could do that too&#34;, this film encourages us to care a little more about others, and realize even a small effort can mean a good deal to someone.",4,"Asks each of us, to go out of our comfort zone and do more for others.",1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,2803,"['First', 'even', 'dark', 'movie', 'about', 'pain', 'loneliness', 'also', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'even', 'have', 'exert', 'ourselves', 'may', 'suffer', 'embarrassment', 'frustration', 'several', 'characters', 'movie', 'do', 'are', 'lifted', 'up', 'bit', 'made', 'higher', 'encouraged', 'do', 'better', 'so', 'movie', 'also', 'feel', 'good', 'movie.But', 'IS', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'cussing', 'not', 'much', 'instance', 'probably', 'was', 'needed', 'show', 'crassness', 'environment', 'pain', 'situations', 'people', 'living', 'dark', 'live', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'was', 'not', 'much.Basically', 'see', 'poor', 'child', 'communion', 'obvious', 'not', 'well', 'taken', 'care', 'story', 'cuts', 'priest', 'doing', 'confessions', 'woman', 'tells', 'awful', 'life', 'story', 'going', 'kill', 'priest', 'overwhelmed', 'thought', 'woman', 'killing', 'week', 'did', 'not', 'address', 'need', 'confessing', 'try', 'wash', 'clean', 'pain', 'guilt', 'either', 'empathy', 'ethics', 'humanity', 'set', 'trying', 'find', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'anonymous', 'having', 'only', 'seen', 'crucifix', 'wore', 'mesh', 'confessional', 'was', 'young', 'underbelly', 'society.He', 'tries', 'search', 'places', 'When', 'hear', 'confession', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'what', 'was', 'confessed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'why', 'looking', 'woman', '34', 'people', '34', 'assume', 'worst', 'most', 'part', 'beat', 'up', 'humiliated', 'afraid', 'trying', 'find', 'woman', 'help', 'such', 'basically', 'journey', 'Christ', 'mire', 'afraid', 'humiliated', 'beat', 'up', 'trying', 'help', 'what', 'do', 'others.While', 'priest', 'main', 'character', 'see', 'humanity', 'sampling', 'people', 'interacting', 'see', 'prostitute', 'try', 'come', 'resolution', 'anger', 'hate', 'abandonment', 'loneliness', 'greatness', 'own', 'spirit', 'maybe', 'never', 'watching', 'may', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'know', 'good', 'path', 'trying', 'save', 'rippling', 'effect', 'pebble', 'thrown', 'pond', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'pebbles', 'reach', 'What', 'see', 'film', 'person', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'trying', 'avoid', 'temptation', 'ignore', 'other', 'pain', 'need', 'even', 'one', 'own', 'desires', 'just', 'watching', 'person', 'jumping', 'off', 'diving', 'board', 'who', 'wish', 'dive', 'think.', '34', 'maybe', 'could', 'do', 'too', '34', 'film', 'care', 'little', 'more', 'others', 'realize', 'even', 'small', 'effort', 'can', 'mean', 'good', 'deal', 'someone']",Into Temptation

The priest attempts to find and save her, and in doing so plunges himself into a darker side of society.Jeremy Sisto stars as Catholic priest Father John,who has become complacent in his vocation until the day that a depressed prostitute, Linda Salerno,played wonderfully by Kristin Chenowith,wanders into his confessional and reveals that she intends to commit suicide on her birthday -- and then disappears. Father John's quest to find and save the woman leads him on a journey into the city's sexual underworld, where he finds help from unexpected sources.Into Temptation redeems the Catholic faith in the sense that it shows that priests do exist to help lost souls and bring them to God.Aside from that,it also explores the effect of the sacrament of confession.It was wonderful in the sense that it shows that this neglected sacrament does help in bringing people closer to God.Aside from that,it also examines the power of forgiveness and its effect to everyone.The performances in the movie were great especially that of Kristin Chenowith,who is outstanding in evoking the emotional complexities felt by the prostitute,Linda Salerno.She truly was effective in gaining the sympathy of the viewer.Great mention should also be given to Jeremy Sisto,who was good in portraying also the inner struggle that a Catholic priest like Father John does experience inside as a person and as a priest. Although there are many ambiguities in the screenplay as other events of the stories are left for the viewers to decide,this is one film that would truly be appreciated by many Catholics who wants to gain faith in the Church and their religion and people who love great independent movies.",5,It Redeems Priests And Catholicism,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,2005,"['Catholicism', 'been', 'attack', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'due', 'abuse', 'children', 'immoral', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'one', 'movie', 'it.Into', 'Temptation', 'independent', 'drama', 'film', 'story', 'prostitute', 'who', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'kill', 'birthday', 'priest', 'find', 'save', 'doing', 'so', 'darker', 'side', 'society.Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Father', 'John', 'who', 'become', 'complacent', 'vocation', 'day', 'depressed', 'prostitute', 'Linda', 'Salerno', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Kristin', 'Chenowith', 'wanders', 'confessional', 'reveals', 'commit', 'suicide', 'birthday', 'then', 'disappears', 'Father', 'John', 'quest', 'find', 'save', 'woman', 'journey', 'city', 'sexual', 'underworld', 'where', 'help', 'unexpected', 'sources.Into', 'Temptation', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'sense', 'priests', 'do', 'exist', 'help', 'lost', 'souls', 'bring', 'God.Aside', 'also', 'effect', 'sacrament', 'confession.It', 'was', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'neglected', 'sacrament', 'help', 'bringing', 'people', 'closer', 'God.Aside', 'also', 'power', 'forgiveness', 'effect', 'everyone.The', 'performances', 'movie', 'were', 'great', 'especially', 'Kristin', 'Chenowith', 'who', 'outstanding', 'evoking', 'emotional', 'complexities', 'felt', 'prostitute', 'Linda', 'Salerno.She', 'truly', 'was', 'effective', 'gaining', 'sympathy', 'viewer.Great', 'mention', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'given', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'who', 'was', 'good', 'portraying', 'also', 'inner', 'struggle', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Father', 'John', 'experience', 'inside', 'person', 'priest', 'are', 'many', 'ambiguities', 'screenplay', 'other', 'events', 'stories', 'are', 'left', 'viewers', 'decide', 'one', 'film', 'would', 'truly', 'be', 'appreciated', 'many', 'Catholics', 'who', 'gain', 'faith', 'Church', 'religion', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'great', 'independent', 'movies']",Into Temptation

1263704,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B002DLB184,Eric Sanberg,"[5, 8]","Normally, a movie like this would have taken place during Christmas in that you feel the hand of fate hovering over things.Here's the scoop. Jeremy Sisto is a priest. While presiding over confession a woman enters the booth and says she's going to end her life. He's dumbfounded, and before he can say anything she disappears into the night. All he knows about her is her voice and that she wears a crucifix around her neck. He spends the rest of the movie trying to find her in the hopes he can keep her from committing suicide.A lot of people seemed to like this a lot and it escapes me. I found it all to be very clumsy. The few religious authorities (priests, reverends, etc.) I've met in my time have all been very sharp, articulate, excellent conversationalists. Too many of the conversations the priest engages in here show him as a rather bumbling individual. Granted, he cannot reveal anything disclosed in the confessional but I couldn't see where that was a problem with what he was trying to do. And the way things started to come together at the end bothered me. It was too much like a holiday family movie. I do applaud the producers in one aspect of the ending. They thankfully took the high road. The producers/ director also failed to build any sense of tension. There's a time limit implied and I felt too little sense of urgency, so when the story culminates, I felt it lacking in emotional gravity.I'm not a big Jeremy Sisto fan and his performance here didn't do anything to help me out. He just seemed miscast, as did Kristin Chenoweth as the prostitute. It didn't help that her part was woefully small, even though the movie was as much about her as it was about the priest. Almost everything here seemed out of sync. The production values were decent enough given the content but the direction was lackluster. The whole thing needed to be tighter and more dynamic.Not a bad watch I suppose but there are a lot better dramas out there to view.By the way. There are a lot of 5 star reviews here and a serious number of them are reviews by reviewers where this is the only, or one of the only, movies they've reviewed.

1263708,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B002DLB184,Lee Armstrong,"[9, 9]","Wow!  From the advertising, I hesitantly rented this DVD.  I thought this might be a story about a priest who battles with his biological urges.  While that might have been interesting, what ""Into Temptation"" delivers is a powerful portrayal of a priest as a shepherd who searches for the lost lamb.  Jeremy Sisto came onto my radar screen with the HBO series ""Six Feet Under.""  As Father John Buerlein, he effortlessly moves into the shoes of a man of faith.  This is a powerful performance worthy of Oscar recognition that will probably not be considered because it is a small art film.  But Sisto is amazing.  One of the most difficult of human experiences for an actor to show is faith.  It is such a subtle, subjective and internal experience.  The scene near the end where Buerlein sits in chapel with tears streaming down his face puts an emotional face on faith and connects with the audience.  The shadings Sisto brings to the role of a nontraditional priest who tries to minister to the person rather than a priest who experiences faith as if he were reading from a rulebook make us feel like this is a real person, one we could know and would like to know.  The performance and the subject matter make this a remarkable film.  Kristen Chenoweth who has long been a Broadway favorite and recently was on the series ""Pushing Daisies"" plays Linda Salerno, a prostitute trying to make amends and leave a life in which she sees no value.  While I love the bubbly happy musical comedy side of her talent such as on the recent lifetime movie ""The Twelve Men of Christmas,"" this rather sad portrayal may be her best film work.  It's gritty and real.  Brian Baumgartner turns in an excellent performance as Buerlein's sounding board, Father Ralph O'Brien.

This was a fanstastic movie with great characters all the way through.  Jeremy Sisto was simply outstanding as Father John and it helped that he had a supporting cast that was just excellent.  Kristin Chenowith was also very good in her role as LInda, however Linda was more of a large supporting role than being a co-star.  There is no doubt that the ending leaves the viewer with the oppurtunity to discuss the plot with others who have seen it.  The film is about redemption.  The only question is who is the one being redeemed.  It seemed like there was  a lot of redemption going on in this movie.  There was humor throughout and it was well done, being incorporated into the plot with seeming spontanaity that made it so natural for the situations.

Jeremy Sisto plays a Catholic priest in a poor parish, Father John who hears a disturbing confession from a troubled woman, prostitute Linda (Kristin Chenoweth). Linda relates her sexual abuse at the age of 12 by her stepfather, and other intimate details before proclaiming her intent to kill herself on her birthday. Instead of granting her absolution, John tries to get more details from Linda (who does not identify herself in the confessional, and the only thing John glimpses is her crucifix and the sound of her unique sultry voice) but she leaves suddenly, and John is left feeling tormented and guilty, obsessed with finding her and helping her before its too late.There are basically two main parallel story lines, as John's harried attempts to find Linda plays alongside Linda's methodical approach to her birthday and its significance. John's search for Linda is tinged with humor as he finds himself exploring some rather dubious areas, such as the red light district and a porn establishment. This predictably lands him in trouble with the Archbishop, and his one ally in the church is another priest, Fr Ralph (Brain Baumgartner) from a more affluent parish. John's relationship with his fellow parishioners are also explored, especially with a jobless African American man who is enlisted in the search efforts for Linda. Both Jeremy Sisto and Kristin Chenoweth bring a measure of depth and credibility to their respective roles and the rest of the cast are also well-played.I felt this was a sad movie - there is some sporadic humor throughout, but what was heartbreaking to watch was the empty soul that is Linda, a damaged soul who is quite certain she wishes to end it all, and who reflects that she would write a suicide note, but who would read it? The beginning of the movie has a group of children at first communion, and the ending of the movie features the same scene but with elaboration, and I have to say that this last scene in the movie neatly tied up all that the movie was - and it packs one heck of an emotional wallop. This is a compelling movie that explores issues of faith, redemption, and absolution.
