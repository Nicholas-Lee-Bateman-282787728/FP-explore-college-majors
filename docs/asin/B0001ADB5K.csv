Season 4 may offer arguably the best episode of the entire project (""The Lost Child"").  The other two episodes, while not as compelling as the first, still showcase considerably more polished production values than previously.  Both the show and its heroine look a little more expensive than in earlier days.  I peg Season 4 as the turning point for Tennison, when her laser-focus on her career to the detriment of her personal relationships begins to really exert a toll.  Newly promoted to Detective Superintendent, Jane has sacrificed everything to get this new post, including her lover and a chance at motherhood.  She's drinking and smoking heavily again as she does daily battle with criminal scum and the male-dominated Met culture.There is no criminal scum quite like George Marlowe, Jane's nemesis from Season 1. Every great detective mastermind needs a criminal counterpart, and Marlowe is Jane's Professor Moriarty.  Jane put Marlowe away 5 years previously, but his influence resurfaces as London is confronted with a string of what look to be copycat murders of women.  Jane's maverick ways over the handling of the reopened Marlowe investigation will once again get her in hot water with her bosses, putting her precious career in jeopardy.  Mirren displays what a great actress she is because she manages to show Jane's vulnerability under the tough-as-nails facade and makes us care about her even as we flinch at some of her actions.

This particular season has three stories:""The Lost Child"": This is probably the most intense and disturbing.  A child is apparently abducted and events conspire to finger a man who had a past record of sexually abusing a child...but did he kidnap this baby? (special warning:  there is a scene in which this character is shown in a therapy session discussing his fixation on a young child that some people might find extremely tough to watch)  The story ends with a real bang...an extraordinarily tense hostage situation.""Inner Circles"":  The former manager of a posh country club is found brutally murdered.  The upscale denizens of the club are eager to see the crime blamed on juvenile delinquents from a poor housing estate.  Yet Tennison senses that the killers are from somewhere else.  This episode features one of the most ice cold villains in the series (right up with George Marlow from the first --the pleasant sociopath).""Scent of Darkness"":  This was the one that I didn't think was as strong as the first two (but certainly worthwhile entertainment).  A series of killings hauntingly similar to the ones George Marlow committed in PSI are taking place.  People are beginning to doubt that Marlow was the real killer.  Can Tennison find the truth?If you are looking for cozy British mysteries where murder comes across as a sort of game, Prime Suspect is not for you.

Superintendent Jane Tennison (Helen Mirren) is the no nonsense head detective that sees through the muck to find the killer despite her superior's lack of support.The Lost Child - Directed by Shakespeare in Love's John Madden.  In the usual Prime Suspect twist, Jane has just had an abortion and on her return she is assigned a child abduction case.  The Prime Suspect is a man that physically abused his stepdaughter, Chris Hughes (Robert Glenister) but his current girlfriend has given him a solid alibi.  When the baby is found dead in a sluice, Jane puts the investigation into overdrive.  But when an overzealous police officer shows Hughes' girlfriend a therapy tape, she recants her alibi.  This sends the team after the wrong man.Inner Circles - After a pair of intruders are caught, the owners dead body is found.  When the local DCI is ""otherwise engaged,"" Jane is brought in and she is more interested in who did it than keeping the peace of the quiet town.  The country club inner circle wants the murder to be charged on the intruders but the facts do not support this.  In fact, the victim had financial problems and was involved in a notorious counsel land deal.  When Jane figures it out, the killer himself has been murdered.  Now she has to prove who was behind it all.The Scent of Darkness - A woman's body is found and everything points the killer to be Marlowe.  But Marlowe is in jail (see Prime Suspect 1).  Now Jane has to figure out who is the copycat killer.  And is there an additional motive behind the killing. When Jane refuses to consider the new murders could be linked to the old, a member of team leaks details of the murders.  Or is it her new boyfriend.  Jane gets taken off the case but she continues to investigate and finds out the reason Marlowe was killing his victims.  But now she needs to put together the reason why the new murders are happening.Prime Suspect is the best police drama ever.  Saying these are not as good as the first two is like comparing two fine wines.  These are still better than anything you will find on television.  Helen Mirren has created a detective of great insight that is battling a sexist hierarchy.  Tennison's bosses know that she is the best but cannot give acknowledgement of this to a woman.  Therefore, when she is in charge, she takes no guff and no prisoners.DVD EXTRAS: None",5,The Greatest Police Drama Continues,1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,2511,"['Prime', 'Suspect', '4', 'was', 'different', 'prior', 'three', 'series', 'had', 'three', 'stories', 'three', 'episodes', 'instead', 'one', 'story', 'presented', '3', 'episodes', 'Superintendent', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'nonsense', 'head', 'detective', 'muck', 'find', 'killer', 'superior', 'lack', 'support.The', 'Lost', 'Child', 'Directed', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'John', 'Madden', 'usual', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'twist', 'Jane', 'just', 'had', 'abortion', 'return', 'assigned', 'child', 'abduction', 'case', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'man', 'physically', 'abused', 'stepdaughter', 'Chris', 'Hughes', 'Robert', 'Glenister', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'given', 'solid', 'alibi', 'When', 'baby', 'found', 'dead', 'sluice', 'Jane', 'investigation', 'overdrive', 'when', 'overzealous', 'police', 'officer', 'Hughes', 'girlfriend', 'therapy', 'tape', 'alibi', 'team', 'wrong', 'man.Inner', 'Circles', 'pair', 'intruders', 'are', 'caught', 'owners', 'dead', 'body', 'found', 'When', 'local', 'DCI', 'otherwise', 'engaged', 'Jane', 'brought', 'more', 'interested', 'who', 'did', 'keeping', 'peace', 'quiet', 'town', 'country', 'club', 'inner', 'circle', 'murder', 'be', 'charged', 'intruders', 'facts', 'do', 'not', 'support', 'fact', 'victim', 'had', 'financial', 'problems', 'was', 'involved', 'notorious', 'counsel', 'land', 'deal', 'When', 'Jane', 'out', 'killer', 'been', 'murdered', 'Now', 'prove', 'who', 'was', 'Scent', 'Darkness', 'woman', 'body', 'found', 'everything', 'points', 'killer', 'be', 'Marlowe', 'Marlowe', 'jail', 'see', 'Prime', 'Suspect', '1', 'Now', 'Jane', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'copycat', 'killer', 'there', 'additional', 'motive', 'killing', 'When', 'Jane', 'consider', 'new', 'murders', 'could', 'be', 'linked', 'old', 'member', 'team', 'leaks', 'details', 'murders', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Jane', 'taken', 'off', 'case', 'investigate', 'out', 'reason', 'Marlowe', 'was', 'killing', 'victims', 'now', 'put', 'together', 'reason', 'why', 'new', 'murders', 'are', 'happening.Prime', 'Suspect', 'best', 'police', 'drama', 'ever', 'Saying', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'comparing', 'two', 'fine', 'wines', 'are', 'still', 'better', 'anything', 'will', 'find', 'television', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'created', 'detective', 'great', 'insight', 'battling', 'sexist', 'hierarchy', 'Tennison', 'bosses', 'know', 'best', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'acknowledgement', 'woman', 'Therefore', 'when', 'charge', 'guff', 'prisoners.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",Prime Suspect 4
