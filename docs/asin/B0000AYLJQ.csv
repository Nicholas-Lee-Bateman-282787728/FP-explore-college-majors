768992,ABARNA66MT43U,B0000AYLJQ,Bonemonkey,"[1, 1]","This film has all the raw ingredients to be a pile of absolute crap. Infact it would have been a pile of absolute crap, but luckily at a certain point (quite near the start) the people that made it must have got very drunk and told eachother how boring the end result was going to be, and so pretty much gave up any attempt at making a serious film with any kind of serious moral lessons to be learned. The exact moment this happens is probably when they introduce the half-wolf-man-thing in a waistcoat into the picture for no possible reason other than hilarity. The end result is a highly entertaining & ridiculous &#34;prisoners on the run&#34; movie.The film kicks off with pretty much no budget whatsoever. We get to see various footage of riots from around the world, then two people are randomly arrested and thrown into a van (with someone else) for being &#34;against the state&#34;. It is hinted at that there is some kind of rebellion going on &#34;against the state&#34; and that talking about it on the radio is especially likely to get you arrested.Anyway, they get taken to the worlds least populated prison/concentration camp which is run by a stereotypical power happy warden, a guard (who looks like super-Mario) with a whip and a guard (who looks like a strongman from a Russian circus) with a cockney accent. The guards solely concentrate on the new inmates leaving the limited extras free to stand in the backround doing sod-all pretty much the whole time. There is one other inmate with thick glasses who also gets involved but its obvious from the start that he's going to die.You gotta love Oz-ploitation films - they make sure they get in a scene with topless women in the shower. While in the shower they get to listen to the rules of the death camp. These are mainly that they are allowed to screw all they like (nobody does) but getting pregnant is punishable by death, while getting someone pregnant will result in &#34;the chop&#34; (access to birth control is not mentioned).I'm not sure if the director had just seen another film about prisoners being hunted by the wardens but he decides that this is the way to go to spice up the film, so some game hunters are brought in. One of them is a woman who has all different types of arrows (we only get to see exploding ones but it is hinted at that she has other ones). Also a man who drives the worlds smallest bulldozer (with a machine gun turret) who brings along the half-wolf-man-thing in a waistcoat.Anyway, the &#34;Turkeys&#34; (as it says they are called on the dvd box, I don't remember it being mentioned in the film) get to run around the island being chased by the various people who are there to chase them. The half-wolf-man-thing in a waistcoat gets to rip off someones toe and eat it. The woman who has all different types of arrows gets to fire some (exploding ones) at a tree near to where a Turkey is hiding. The man who drives the worlds smallest bulldozer (with a machine gun turret) gets to drive it (then stand on the machine gun turret) until he gets his head chopped off. The guard (who looks like a strongman from a Russian circus) with a cockney accent gets to drown a Turkey in a rockpool (before they both climb out and are bone-dry seconds later) only to get his hands chopped off. The guard (who looks like super-Mario) with a whip gets his legs chopped off. The stereotypical power happy warden gets his head blown off. Revenge is pretty much had by the Turkeys. Then the film ends and one can only assume that the Turkeys are all killed by the government or just put back in prison for life.All in all this film is highly entertaining and definitely worth a watch.",5,Somehow not a turkey...,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,3678,"['film', 'raw', 'ingredients', 'be', 'pile', 'absolute', 'crap', 'Infact', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pile', 'absolute', 'crap', 'luckily', 'certain', 'point', 'quite', 'start', 'people', 'made', 'must', 'have', 'got', 'very', 'drunk', 'told', 'eachother', 'how', 'boring', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'pretty', 'much', 'gave', 'up', 'attempt', 'making', 'serious', 'film', 'kind', 'serious', 'moral', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'exact', 'moment', 'probably', 'when', 'introduce', 'half-wolf-man-thing', 'waistcoat', 'picture', 'possible', 'reason', 'other', 'hilarity', 'end', 'result', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'ridiculous', '34', 'prisoners', 'run', '34', 'movie.The', 'film', 'kicks', 'off', 'pretty', 'much', 'budget', 'whatsoever', 'get', 'see', 'various', 'footage', 'riots', 'world', 'then', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'randomly', 'arrested', 'thrown', 'van', 'someone', 'else', 'being', '34', 'state', '34', 'hinted', 'kind', 'rebellion', 'going', '34', 'state', '34', 'talking', 'radio', 'especially', 'likely', 'get', 'arrested.Anyway', 'get', 'taken', 'worlds', 'least', 'populated', 'prison/concentration', 'camp', 'run', 'stereotypical', 'power', 'happy', 'warden', 'guard', 'who', 'super-Mario', 'whip', 'guard', 'who', 'strongman', 'Russian', 'circus', 'cockney', 'accent', 'guards', 'solely', 'concentrate', 'new', 'inmates', 'leaving', 'limited', 'extras', 'free', 'stand', 'backround', 'doing', 'sod-all', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'time', 'one', 'other', 'inmate', 'thick', 'glasses', 'who', 'also', 'involved', 'obvious', 'start', 'going', 'die.You', 'got', 'ta', 'Oz-ploitation', 'films', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'scene', 'topless', 'women', 'shower', 'shower', 'get', 'listen', 'rules', 'death', 'camp', 'are', 'mainly', 'are', 'allowed', 'screw', 'like', 'nobody', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'punishable', 'death', 'getting', 'someone', 'pregnant', 'will', 'result', '34', 'chop', '34', 'access', 'birth', 'control', 'not', 'mentioned', '.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'director', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'film', 'prisoners', 'being', 'hunted', 'wardens', 'way', 'go', 'spice', 'up', 'film', 'so', 'game', 'hunters', 'are', 'brought', 'One', 'woman', 'who', 'different', 'types', 'arrows', 'only', 'get', 'see', 'exploding', 'ones', 'hinted', 'other', 'ones', 'Also', 'man', 'who', 'worlds', 'smallest', 'bulldozer', 'machine', 'gun', 'turret', 'who', 'half-wolf-man-thing', 'waistcoat.Anyway', '34', 'Turkeys', '34', 'are', 'called', 'dvd', 'box', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'being', 'mentioned', 'film', 'get', 'run', 'around', 'island', 'being', 'chased', 'various', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'chase', 'half-wolf-man-thing', 'waistcoat', 'rip', 'off', 'someones', 'toe', 'eat', 'woman', 'who', 'different', 'types', 'arrows', 'fire', 'exploding', 'ones', 'tree', 'where', 'Turkey', 'hiding', 'man', 'who', 'worlds', 'smallest', 'bulldozer', 'machine', 'gun', 'turret', 'drive', 'then', 'stand', 'machine', 'gun', 'turret', 'head', 'chopped', 'off', 'guard', 'who', 'strongman', 'Russian', 'circus', 'cockney', 'accent', 'drown', 'Turkey', 'rockpool', 'climb', 'out', 'are', 'bone-dry', 'seconds', 'later', 'only', 'get', 'hands', 'chopped', 'off', 'guard', 'who', 'super-Mario', 'whip', 'legs', 'chopped', 'off', 'stereotypical', 'power', 'happy', 'warden', 'head', 'off', 'Revenge', 'pretty', 'much', 'had', 'Turkeys', 'Then', 'film', 'ends', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'Turkeys', 'are', 'killed', 'government', 'just', 'put', 'back', 'prison', 'life.All', 'film', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'definitely', 'watch']",N/A

The Amazon reviewers are very kind here. And since I saw this as a gaping hole in my viewing history I thought I'd see what Quentin and these reviewers saw here. I'm baffled.Totalitarian society. Re-education camps. Hunting humans for sport. This is an amalgam of ideas thrown together and none of them are done justice. Maybe if I had seen this back during its original release I might have been impressed. I gather from the user reviews that the positive reviews are from those that HAD seen it originally. But for my dollar it hasn't withstood the test of time. This Aussie endeavor was released in 1982, three years after Mad Max, and the directing is pedestrian by comparison. True, there isn't much budget here but Mad Max couldn't have cost much more. And, as Mad Max was George Miller's directorial debut, the difference is even more striking.There are holes all over the place. The hunters have obviously done this before but none of them handle their weapons with any degree of proficiency. The Steve Railsback character gets his hands on a weapon not once, but twice and chooses to leave them be. The Griff character gets the jump on his pursuer but instead of killing him he hangs him upside down from a tree and fashions an impossibly heavy and cumbersome booby trap that will kill him when his buds try to cut him down. This movie is full of crazy stuff like this.There is so little sense here and the directing is so inept I just don't get what all the hubbub is about. If you need to fill in some gaps in your film history as I have, then have at it.

Anyone with distaste for the government ends up in a nazi style camp, where nothing good happens to them except rapes, beatings, lashings, and being turned loose for a chance to escape while being hunted down like animals for sport. Steve Railsback (the stuntman, lifeforce) is great as usual up against some nasty Aussie baddies and one half-man half-beast who's seen too much ""professional"" wrestling on T.V.  Blondie Lynda Stoner is a babe and gives Dolly Parton a run for her money. The all out assault on the camp at the end including fighter jets, showed some decent budget. Prisoners are tortured, babes lose their clothes, a guy gets cut in half, and much more in this freakin' masterpeice!

768997,A3FMLHZJ0VT8WU,B0000AYLJQ,William T. Wiggins,"[3, 3]","A/K/A ""Turkey Shoot"", I discovered this flick thru the great Aussie exploitation documentary, ""Not Quite Hollywood"".  A great find, the film is a bold, shameless women-in-prison / futuristic-death-chase hybrid with virtually nothing but action.  After about (literally) one minute of exposition, we are thrown into the scenario:  three attractive young people are hauled into a cruel ""re-education"" camp, where they can either put up with brutal torture or plan their escape.  They do the latter.  The last half of the film is set up as a ""Most Dangerous Game""-style death hunt.  As the actors will tell you in the DVD extras, anything that was not an action sequence was cut from the script before shooting. That makes for a lack of motivation but an overabundance of fistfights, shower nudity, eye-gouging, bloody motor vehicle mayhem, etc.  My best out-of-nowhere item in the film is the half-man/half-wolf ""pet"" one of the hunters owns... no explanation for its condition is given whatsoever!  It is just dropped into the story without the bat of an eye.  Love it.  Made around the same time as ""Dawn of the Dead"", and with a similar vibe... chaos, violence, nihilism, despair, all set to a pulsing synth score.  4/5.",4,"chaos, violence, nihilism, despair, all set to a pulsing synth score",1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,1221,"['A/K/A', 'Turkey', 'Shoot', 'discovered', 'flick', 'great', 'Aussie', 'exploitation', 'documentary', 'Not', 'Quite', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'find', 'film', 'bold', 'shameless', 'women-in-prison', '/', 'futuristic-death-chase', 'hybrid', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'action', 'literally', 'one', 'minute', 'exposition', 'are', 'thrown', 'scenario', 'three', 'attractive', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'hauled', 'cruel', 're-education', 'camp', 'where', 'can', 'either', 'put', 'up', 'brutal', 'torture', 'plan', 'escape', 'do', 'latter', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'set', 'up', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Game', '-style', 'death', 'hunt', 'actors', 'will', 'tell', 'DVD', 'extras', 'anything', 'was', 'not', 'action', 'sequence', 'was', 'cut', 'script', 'shooting', 'lack', 'motivation', 'overabundance', 'fistfights', 'shower', 'nudity', 'eye-gouging', 'bloody', 'motor', 'vehicle', 'mayhem', 'etc', 'best', 'out-of-nowhere', 'item', 'film', 'half-man/half-wolf', 'pet', 'one', 'hunters', 'explanation', 'condition', 'given', 'whatsoever', 'just', 'dropped', 'story', 'bat', 'eye', 'Love', 'Made', 'same', 'time', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'similar', 'vibe', 'chaos', 'violence', 'nihilism', 'despair', 'set', 'pulsing', 'synth', 'score', '4/5']",N/A
