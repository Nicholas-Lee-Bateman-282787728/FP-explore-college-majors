258191,A2NFTFQYW8GXIQ,6301609638,A. Andersen,"[14, 17]","This is a true document of the original Broadway musical hit with almost all of the original cast (except for Tab Hunter).  However, it is very stage-bound, directed without any natural ease and rather claustrophobic  about its wide-screen format. Because it seems to wait around for audience  applause and moves carefully from scene to scene it can seem dull and  plodding at times.  Walston is fine but not great as Mr. Applegate (Satan)  and Gwen Verdon steals the film recreating her Tony award winning  performance as Lola.  The score is almost intact - three numbers were cut  (A Man Doesn't Know, Near To You and The Game).  The latter is a real loss  but too &quot;naughty&quot; for film audiences of the mid-fifties.  A new  song is added to the film &quot;An Empty Chair.&quot;  Taken as a  document of a hit Broadway show and not as a true film per se, it's quite  enjoyable.  Remarkably the soundtrack is still in print on CD and despite  the loss of the above numbers is preferable to the Original Cast in both  performance and sound quality.",3,Faithful but stage-bound filming of the Broadway hit,964051200,"07 20, 2000",2000,1055,"['true', 'document', 'original', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'hit', 'almost', 'original', 'cast', 'Tab', 'Hunter', 'However', 'very', 'stage-bound', 'directed', 'natural', 'ease', 'rather', 'claustrophobic', 'wide-screen', 'format', 'wait', 'around', 'audience', 'applause', 'moves', 'carefully', 'scene', 'scene', 'can', 'seem', 'dull', 'plodding', 'times', 'Walston', 'fine', 'not', 'great', 'Mr.', 'Applegate', 'Satan', 'Gwen', 'Verdon', 'film', 'recreating', 'Tony', 'award', 'winning', 'performance', 'Lola', 'score', 'almost', 'intact', 'three', 'numbers', 'were', 'cut', 'Man', ""n't"", 'Know', 'Near', 'Game', 'latter', 'real', 'loss', 'too', 'quot', 'quot', 'film', 'audiences', 'mid-fifties', 'new', 'song', 'added', 'film', 'quot', 'Empty', 'Chair.', 'quot', 'Taken', 'document', 'hit', 'Broadway', 'show', 'not', 'true', 'film', 'se', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Remarkably', 'soundtrack', 'still', 'print', 'CD', 'loss', 'above', 'numbers', 'preferable', 'Original', 'Cast', 'performance', 'sound', 'quality']",N/A

It does its job just fine, thank you, but you must remember that stage and film are two different media. In the conservative postwar 50's there was very little controversy shown (or allowed to be shown) in the film and TV media; a Faustian book made into a film musical probably scared the Hays moral office to death! That said, the Abbott-Donen collaboration does a more than competent job of telling the story, and scores an extra base hit retaining most of the Broadway cast of the show in the first place. I've read that the studio tried to lure Marilyn Monroe into playing the Lola role (and assuring box-office returns), but the producers were smart enough to know that the role needed a real dancer-actress combination. In short, it needed Gwen Verdon. It needed her special brand of eccentricity, sexiness, and heartbreak. And it got her.

258202,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6301609638,C. O. DeRiemer,"[68, 72]","Joe Hardy is a fanatic, middle-aged Washington Senators baseball fan who makes a pact with the devil. In exchange for his soul (although there is a small escape clause). he'll become a 22-year-old savior of the Senators, the greatest long ball hitter in history, and he'll lead the team to a pennant. Later, young Hardy shows signs of yearning for the wife he left behind, so the Devil sends in Lola, his vamp supreme. But thanks to Joe's integrity, the escape clause, and after a number of song and dance numbers, things are put right for both Joe and the Senators.The movie is an almost exact replica of the 1956 Broadway hit. Tab Hunter moved in as the young Joe, but everyone else reprised their stage roles -- and that's the reason to see or buy the DVD. Ray Walston plays Applegate, the devil, with barely contained glee. He's sly, unethical, untrustworthy and very funny. Best of all Gwen Verdon plays Lola, and she hits a home run with every number. She was a great dancer and a magnetic stage presence. I saw her do her stuff on stage once and it's a great memory. She had her big break in Can Can in 1954, then starred in three more shows during the Fifties. She won a Tony for each. She married Bob Fosse, retired, had a daughter, divorced Fosse. In 1966 she starred in Sweet Charity. And at 50, in 1975, she starred in Chicago. Believe me, she hadn't lost a thing. She was not the starlet type. She had a grainy, slightly smoky voice, and a personality that could range from gamin to raunchy. She could bring innocence to the most suggestive lyrics. As you can tell, I'm a fan.The score for Damn Yankees is, in my view, better than average but not a classic. It includes ""Whatever Lola Wants,"" ""Two Lost Souls"" and ""Heart."" Fosse did the choreography and dances with Verdon in one number, ""Who's Got the Pain."" It's a clever, fast routine and is a great showcase for them both.",4,Fine Showcase for a Terrific Gwen Verdon,1100736000,"11 18, 2004",2004,1889,"['Joe', 'Hardy', 'fanatic', 'middle-aged', 'Washington', 'Senators', 'baseball', 'fan', 'who', 'pact', 'devil', 'exchange', 'soul', 'small', 'escape', 'clause', ""'ll"", 'become', '22-year-old', 'savior', 'Senators', 'greatest', 'long', 'ball', 'hitter', 'history', ""'ll"", 'lead', 'team', 'pennant', 'Later', 'young', 'Hardy', 'signs', 'yearning', 'wife', 'left', 'behind', 'Devil', 'Lola', 'vamp', 'supreme', 'thanks', 'Joe', 'integrity', 'escape', 'clause', 'number', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'things', 'are', 'put', 'right', 'Joe', 'Senators.The', 'movie', 'almost', 'exact', 'replica', '1956', 'Broadway', 'hit', 'Tab', 'Hunter', 'moved', 'young', 'Joe', 'everyone', 'else', 'reprised', 'stage', 'roles', 'reason', 'see', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'Applegate', 'devil', 'barely', 'contained', 'glee', 'sly', 'unethical', 'untrustworthy', 'very', 'funny', 'Best', 'Gwen', 'Verdon', 'Lola', 'home', 'run', 'number', 'was', 'great', 'dancer', 'magnetic', 'stage', 'presence', 'saw', 'do', 'stuff', 'stage', 'once', 'great', 'memory', 'had', 'big', 'break', 'Can', 'Can', '1954', 'then', 'starred', 'three', 'more', 'shows', 'Fifties', 'won', 'Tony', 'married', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'retired', 'had', 'daughter', 'divorced', 'Fosse', '1966', 'starred', 'Sweet', 'Charity', '50', '1975', 'starred', 'Chicago', 'Believe', 'had', ""n't"", 'lost', 'thing', 'was', 'not', 'starlet', 'type', 'had', 'grainy', 'slightly', 'smoky', 'voice', 'personality', 'could', 'range', 'gamin', 'raunchy', 'could', 'bring', 'innocence', 'most', 'suggestive', 'lyrics', 'can', 'tell', ""'m"", 'fan.The', 'score', 'Damn', 'Yankees', 'view', 'better', 'average', 'not', 'classic', 'Lola', 'Wants', 'Two', 'Lost', 'Souls', 'Heart', 'Fosse', 'did', 'choreography', 'dances', 'Verdon', 'one', 'number', 'Who', 'Got', 'Pain', 'clever', 'fast', 'routine', 'great', 'showcase']",N/A

If I could nutshell it I would describe it as a musical Mephistopheles by way of ""The Natural"".  It offers a terrific snapshot of America in the fifties when baseball was king (and the Yankees won 8 pennants and five World Series), McCarthy-era journalism, and the state of the Broadway show at that time.  The downside to the film is it's main story offers up too many worn-out baseball cliches.  The film just barely transcends it's stage origins.  Tab Hunter, affable fellow that he seems, is a tad on the bland side.  During Gwen Verdon's showstopping ""What Lola Wants"" sequence I could swear she was performing to a statue.  On the plus side Ray Walston offers up a deliciously devilish Applegate with a dollop of dark humor thrown in.  Superlatives are not enough to describe Verdon's contribution to this film.  Every time she's on screen she grabs the gusto and just emits effervescent sauciness.  The songs here are generally good.  Bob Fosse's choreography is just jaw-dropping.

258209,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6301609638,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Throw in some baseball and several catchy songs, and dust off that old Faust legend, and you get this breezy 1958 musical from Warner Brothers. Originally a hugely successful Broadway play, DAMN YANKEES returns most of the original stage cast, with Tab Hunter taking over in the lead role. And, having seen the uber-bland, very clean cut Tab Hunter in other films, I probably should've scoffed at his being cast in a showy song & dance flick except that, surprisingly, the man actually unveils a more relaxed, fun-loving side to him. So it all works.Joe Boyd (Robert Shafer) is a middle-aged, die-hard fan of the Washington Senators, and because the Senators are pretty awful, Joe is also a long-suffering fan. After grousing over another of his team's inept showings on television (with the Senators again getting pummeled by the Yankees), Joe exclaims ""One long ball hitter, that's what we need! I'd sell my soul for one long-ball hitter."" Moments later, the mysterious dapperly-dressed Mr. Applegate appears on his porch and an infernal bargain is struck: a long ball hitter for a soul. But with an escape clause which allows Joe Boyd to change his mind before a set deadline.Soon the woeful Senators have a new player on the roster, a 22-year-old powerhouse slugger named Joe Hardy (Hunter), or as one female reporter dubs him: ""Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo."" Joe Hardy promptly leads his team from the cellar to contention and, ultimately, to a pennant race with the New York Yankees. You'd think Joe Hardy and Mr. Applegate would be ecstatic. But, no.It's that thing about absence and how it makes the heart grow fonder. Joe Hardy is having second thoughts. He misses the wife he'd abandoned, misses his old life as Joe Boyd. He's wandered back into his old neighborhood and managed to rent a room in his old house, all just so he'd be closer to a wife who's now decades older than him. And, of course, all this is stressing out Applegate. Fearing that he might lose out on this soul, he sics the demonic temptress Lola on Joe (She's irresistible, you fool!).For old-school folks like me, DAMN YANKEES is great fun. This movie rides on the playful, gleeful performances of Ray Walston and Gwen Verdon, and on the songs, several of which have managed to stick with me even after all this time. I savor them all, from Shafer and Hunter's poignant ""Goodbye, Old Girl"" and the exuberant ""(You've Gotta Have) Heart"" and ""Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo"" to Verdon's seductive showstopper ""Whatever Lola Wants."" And then there's the mambo treat ""Who's Got the Pain"" (Erp!), also performed by Verdon and partnered up by noted choreographer Bob Fosse (and also Verdon's hubbie).So, yeah, this movie is tailored more towards comedy and musical numbers, so the baseball sequences aren't exactly what you'd call gritty or suspenseful.

Shertzer,"[22, 22]","When Warners brought Adler and Ross's ""Pajama Game"" and ""Damn Yankees"" to the screen, they make a wise choice: they brought most of the shows' original Broadway casts with them, substituting just two photogenic major studio contract players (Doris Day for Janis Paige in ""Game"" and Tab Hunter for Stephen Douglass in ""Yankees"") in leading roles. In Day's case it was probably an improvement; Hunter's not great but he's no embarrassment. Stanley Donen (on loan from MGM?) teamed up with the great stage director George Abbott for the films, and (thankfully!) Bob Fosse restaged his original dance numbers. Naturally there had to be some cuts - risque material (""The Game"" in ""Yankees"", ""Think of the Time I Save"" in ""Pajama"") was excised - and the shows were tightened. But the spirits of the original shows were better captured than in most Hollywood transfers. The new DVD of ""Yankees"" arrived today and it's regrettable that there are no bonuses and there's no stereo track (unlike MGM and Fox, Warners apparently didn't believe much in multichannel recording at the time). But the show, though a little dated, is still great fun. Anyone who knows Ray Walston merely from ""My Favorite Martian"" is due for a special treat. Vernon, whose Hollywood career during her musical prime was far too brief, is ALWAYS a treat, and Lola was one of her signature roles.

Three songs were left out and one added (at least it isn't on the cast album, and is a bloodless little thing and is used inexplicably instead of ""A Man Doesn't Know"" to end the show).  The other 2 left out are ""Near to You"" and ""The Game.""  Maybe ""The Game"" was meant to be in the movie but the censors got cold feet, because the tune is in the overture/credits.  It's a darling cute song and I wish they'd left it in.  As near as I could tell, only one song got cleaned up and that was ""A Little Brains - A Little Talent.""  One word (boffola) was changed to something strange, and a few lines were changed.  ""You've seen the sign that says George Washington once slept here.  Well though nobody spied him, guess who was beside him.""  What they changed it too was just as risque, just more subtle.  ""When they turned the lamps on, guess who was with Samson.""  I swore that if they destroyed this Adler/Ross treasure like they did Pajama Game with their puritanical fantacism, I would return the movie (I rented it to watch and kept the one I bought the day it was released unopened).  I'll keep it.  Changing ""bofola"" is just pointless, and the rhyme lamps on/Samson is so clever, it's as good as what it replaced.  I'd like it if they'd left both in.

She was terrific, and YES, &quot;Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.&quot;  My favorite part was when Lola was reminding herself that she should &quot;Never Feel Sorry for Anybody.&quot;  She kept repeating those five words to herself endlessly, even though she couldn't find that in her heart because Lola really was a sweet woman.  Lola was played by the gifted broadway star Gwen Verdon, who died recently.  That was quite a loss to me, because Verdon liked to sing, and she liked to dance and she loved children too.

What a great cast of performers. Nothing was lost from the Broadway stage in this production. And nothing is lost from the movie in this excellent transfer to DVD. Through the magic of Hollywood, when done to perfection, film can even enhance the story. And few have done the job with a Musical as well as this Gem.
