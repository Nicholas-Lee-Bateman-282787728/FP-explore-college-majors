1110981,AOC9C3JHD6F5G,B000WOSAUQ,"Ana M. Vasquez ""jvavbv""","[2, 4]","Strongly agree & beautifully stated by reviewer Bowers.  Denise Austin's cues were completely out of sequence and at times I didn't know what was going on or what to do next.  I was wondering does she think I have eyes like a spider that I can see the TV while facing down on the floor mat.  She also doesn't give you sufficent time to get into the yoga poses.  Moves to quickly to enjoy yoga.  I was extremely upset and ready to ditch the DVD.  I thought yoga is suppose to be calming but not with Denise Austin.  Oh and lets not forget her voice - annoying.  I just started Yoga a year ago and watch Steve Ross on Oxygen at 6:00 am, and also brought Ellen Barrett super slimdown crunch: Pilates Yoga Blend and I can say now they know how to cue.  I had purchased a Denise Austin video years ago and it was the same issue - her cueing, out of sequence or never called out.  I was hoping she had taken the time to read her viewer comments and made some changes to her workouts.  Guess not.",1,Out of Cue,1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,989,"['Strongly', 'agree', 'beautifully', 'stated', 'reviewer', 'Bowers', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'cues', 'were', 'completely', 'sequence', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'was', 'wondering', 'think', 'have', 'eyes', 'spider', 'can', 'see', 'TV', 'facing', 'down', 'floor', 'mat', 'also', ""n't"", 'give', 'sufficent', 'time', 'get', 'yoga', 'poses', 'Moves', 'quickly', 'enjoy', 'yoga', 'was', 'extremely', 'upset', 'ready', 'ditch', 'DVD', 'thought', 'yoga', 'suppose', 'be', 'calming', 'not', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'Oh', 'not', 'forget', 'voice', 'annoying', 'just', 'started', 'Yoga', 'year', 'ago', 'watch', 'Steve', 'Ross', 'Oxygen', '6:00', 'am', 'also', 'brought', 'Ellen', 'Barrett', 'super', 'slimdown', 'crunch', 'Pilates', 'Yoga', 'Blend', 'can', 'say', 'now', 'know', 'how', 'cue', 'had', 'purchased', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'video', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'same', 'issue', 'cueing', 'sequence', 'never', 'called', 'out', 'was', 'hoping', 'had', 'taken', 'time', 'read', 'viewer', 'comments', 'made', 'changes', 'workouts', 'Guess', 'not']",Denise Austin: Yoga Body Burn

You would think that I prefer that to excerpts from the regular show itself.  They do them 'fresh' because they are incredibly inexpensive to make.  I would prefer even LESS expensive clips from her show.  The reason being is that her regular show had a certain spontaneity, a variety of locations, outfits, themes, etc.  Her DVD's are so purposeful that anyone on earth could make them.

You should have some knowledge of yoga beforehand as this really is NOT an instructional DVD. Denise packs a lot of great yoga postures into a short amount of time, yet she holds the poses for a good amount of time and really doesn't seem rushed.A reviewer said she does not cue well, but I think it's just fine: you should have some knowledge of yoga already and know about the positioning of your body in specific poses. Once you get used to the routine it is really easy to follow and quite fun!You get 4 routines on the DVD and it's great because with the menus you can mix and match in any order you like. The first one is the longest and called Total Yoga Toning. It includes standing postures, most vinyasa style (lots of flow and movement). I especially like the next three: Legs, Abs, and Stretch; each one is approx. 10 minutes for a great quick 30 min yoga session. Some of the postures can be a bit of a challenge; this is much more traditional than I've seen from Denise in previous DVDs. The set is beautiful, bright orange blue water fall in the background.This is not hard core yoga, but a lovely easy practice that will definitely brighten and start your day right. If you like Denise's other DVD, you will like this one. (If you don't like her voice, upbeat attitude, cueing, etc., you will probably not like this one either.) You can mute her voice and just have music, although I don't see the benefit of this option since you would have to constantly look up to follow along. (A choice of no music would be nice then I could add my own, but that option is not available on this DVD.)Please check my other reviews on Amazon for other great yoga practices, Namaste'",5,Fun Denise Austin Yoga Routine.

Like many people have already said; this DVD is not for beginners b/c there is minimal instructions. BUT... To be honest, I kind of like that because I dislike when instructors waste time describing the asanas.  If you are very familiar with yoga and want a FAST-Paced yoga workout, this is a winner.  There is no spiritual aspect to this DVD(and I have a few RAVI ANA, Shiva Rea, and Gurmukh DVDS for that) This is short, sweet and to the point.  I have not done a Denise Austin DVD  since college, but this DVD is one of the best!!!! I was was definately working more intensely at this video.  Some people may not like the fast cuing, but I think that is what makes this video so challenging and effective.  If you like slower paced and easier yoga, 10 minute yoga solutions is probably better for you.  Also, I love ALL the poses especially dancers pose and pigeon pose. One more thing.. So many of the poses on the entire DVD are excellent for runners. Since I workout and run almost everyday, I feel this DVD is perfect.

However, I have to give her low marks for her cueing on this workout.  This is a pet peeve of many who exercise with her, but I usually don't mind her cheery babble.  This one's pretty bad that way, though.  As she does so infuriatingly on her TV shows, she puts you in a position where you can't see the TV, then says something like ""Put your hands right here.""  Right where?  While I'm doing a free workout on Lifetime, I don't mind.  When I've bought a DVD which should have had more planning (perhaps a script?), I expect more.  While I liked the workout, I found myself getting mad by the time she put me in Corpse Pose and told me to clear my mind.If you've never done yoga before, don't start here -- it moves too fast (at an aerobic pace), and Denise will have you thoroughly confused.  (Beginners -- try the excellent Yoga Zone DVDs.)  You'd never know it by this review, but I'm actually a fan of Denise's.  Her recent Hit The Spot Pilates is one of my all-time favorites.

1110997,AYTBAXJ2Q958V,B000WOSAUQ,YogaGurl,"[0, 0]","I just did this DVD this morning and I know it will be one of the DVD's I keep coming back to.  What I love about this DVD and other Denise Austin yoga DVD's (Fat Blasting yoga, Power Yoga Plus) is that her yoga is DYNAMIC...meaning moving instead of just holding a pose for a long time.  I know many do not enjoy this way of doing yoga and they feel that Denise moves too fast. They would rather have the traditional type of yoga that is more meditative and holding poses longer. That is understandable and that kind of yoga is wonderful, too...but on most days when I want to feel energized (in the mornings) and get a good yoga workout in quick, and in a very fun way, I choose Denise Austin's yoga DVD's. The more meditative, restorative, holding the postures for longer I do in the evenings when I have more time and want to relax.There is a lot of value in this DVD. There is the basic body burn (20 minutes), yoga abs (10), yoga legs (10) and yoga relax (10).  Today I did just the body burn and yoga abs and I felt I got a great workout and was ready to face the day.  I really appreciate how I only needed 30 minutes to feel great.  I also like how I can do any segments I want and get a nice, quick, refreshing work out in.  All the segments are interesting and fun.  I believe in all of them there were new ways of moving I have never done before.

1110998,ATD5QN72ZB4MR,B000WOSAUQ,Zenkitty,"[6, 6]","Denise has truly perfected her own brand of yoga with this dvd. This is not for yoga purists and I'm a little tickled that anyone would even expect a traditional, authentic yoga practice from a Denise Austin video!But if you like a challenging (but not so hard that it's discouraging) workout incorporating the incredible strengthening and stretching benefits of yoga with fun new moves, then this is for you.First off, this is by far the most beautiful indoor set on a fitness dvd and the visuals transform this from a workout into an experience (the gorgeous music doesn't hurt, either).Denise avoids boring repetitions so often found in other power yoga dvds; as a result, this dvd is packed with so many inventive variations of traditional yoga moves (like the ""Eagle Crunch"") that time just flies.The fast pace of the dvd adds the benefits of cardio to what is essentially a full-body strengthening and stretching workout. The stretching moves are consistently intertwined within the strengthening exercises, so soreness is greatly alleviated (although attempting the crow pose was definitely too much for my wrists).I generally do the entire program but I love the fact that it can also be done as four separate workouts (and although one targets legs and one targets abs, trust me when I say that you will feel your entire body engaged in these segments!).I have dozens and dozens of other workout dvds (including most of  Denise's) but I can't bear to do any besides Yoga Body Burn, Hit the Spot Pilates, and Body Burn Dance and Pilates (also by Denise). Those three give me the most intense, all-encompassing workouts that my body needs and I am so addicted to them!",5,Best Workout DVD Ever,1235606400,"02 26, 2009",2009,1675,"['Denise', 'truly', 'perfected', 'own', 'brand', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'not', 'yoga', 'purists', ""'m"", 'little', 'tickled', 'anyone', 'would', 'even', 'expect', 'traditional', 'authentic', 'yoga', 'practice', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'video', 'like', 'challenging', 'not', 'so', 'hard', 'discouraging', 'incorporating', 'incredible', 'strengthening', 'stretching', 'benefits', 'yoga', 'fun', 'new', 'moves', 'then', 'you.First', 'off', 'far', 'most', 'beautiful', 'indoor', 'set', 'fitness', 'dvd', 'visuals', 'transform', 'workout', 'experience', 'gorgeous', 'music', ""n't"", 'hurt', '.Denise', 'avoids', 'boring', 'repetitions', 'so', 'often', 'found', 'other', 'power', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'result', 'dvd', 'packed', 'so', 'many', 'inventive', 'variations', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'moves', 'Eagle', 'Crunch', 'time', 'just', 'flies.The', 'fast', 'pace', 'dvd', 'benefits', 'cardio', 'what', 'essentially', 'full-body', 'strengthening', 'stretching', 'workout', 'stretching', 'moves', 'are', 'consistently', 'intertwined', 'strengthening', 'exercises', 'so', 'soreness', 'greatly', 'alleviated', 'attempting', 'crow', 'pose', 'was', 'definitely', 'too', 'much', 'wrists', '.I', 'generally', 'do', 'entire', 'program', 'love', 'fact', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'done', 'four', 'separate', 'workouts', 'one', 'targets', 'one', 'targets', 'abs', 'trust', 'when', 'say', 'will', 'feel', 'entire', 'body', 'engaged', 'segments', 'have', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'other', 'workout', 'dvds', 'including', 'most', 'Denise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'do', 'besides', 'Yoga', 'Body', 'Burn', 'Hit', 'Spot', 'Pilates', 'Body', 'Burn', 'Dance', 'Pilates', 'also', 'Denise', 'three', 'give', 'most', 'intense', 'all-encompassing', 'workouts', 'body', 'needs', 'am', 'so', 'addicted']",Denise Austin: Yoga Body Burn
