I love this DVD and it REALLY makes me sweat more then I thought I would.  This DVD is broken up into a warm-up, 4 aerobic programs (I am only doing the first right now), a 6 minute ab workout and a cool down.  I love the ab workout as it is different versions of crunches.

The reason why is because:- he warns you of a change in step before it happens and he's consistent about this- his counting is never off - or at least I haven't discovered any counting errors- the videographers don't try to get artsy with the cuts, so there is never a cut at the outset of a new step or a transition between steps (I haven't found any other exercise DVD that can boast this and this is important if you want to learn the steps and keep up)- although the steps themselves are realitively simple, the way Gilad combines them is quite challenging cardio-wise- the overall combinations are funThe only thing you need to know about him is that he will say that you're getting ready to do the ""last one;"" and instead of meaning the very last step, he means the last combination of steps (one to each side, left and right). So for instance, if you are stepping up on the step and kicking with, first the left foot, and then you switch to the right foot (step up and kick). Instead of the final right foot kick being the ""last one,"" Gilad means the last set of left and right kicks. (I hope that made sense.

Once I did buy it, the DVD quickly became one of my favorites.Gilad's warm-up routine is among the best in workout videos and my personal favorite.  It's low impact, but gets you moving right away.  The step routines are very athletic and very repetitive.  Personally, I like repetition because it allows me to focus on getting the most out of each movement (squeezing my muscles, keeping the abs in, standing tall).  There's enough variety, though, to keep you interested and enough movement to keep you energized.  But my favorite part about the step routines is that every time I do this workout, I feel challenged because of the athleticism required.In addition to the very relaxing cool down, there's a separate ab workout that's a nice addition.I like Gilad as an instructor.  His cues are excellent and I find him motivating.Here's a weird thing that creeps me out, though.
