The story, without spoiling it, is simply about people who hear God talking through the radio to them, trying to get them to think about things.Theology-wise, the movie is pretty vague and general, not wanting to offend anyone but it still had a good message.

283411,A3L4ZJ6OKPGM3S,6301972228,First Peter,"[1, 1]","The film, ""The Next Voice You Hear..."", is a 1950 Sci-Fi low-budget B-movie cult classic. Many reviewers pan this film, simply dismissing it as a cheap piece of Cold War propaganda. However; I think the film simultaneously works well as both propaganda and an offbeat science fiction movie, that goes way outside the box, where few films are brave enough to tread.Fine performances are turned in as an average, working class, all-American couple by Nancy Reagan & James Whitmore. The direction & cinematography are competent, especially considering the ultra-low budget. The original score and theme sound like a classic hymn that you would sing in church.The premise, that God speaks to the world over the radio, sounds incredibly hoaky to our 21st century cynical minds, but it comes off as totally believable thanks to a tight script, solid acting and directing.This particular DVD, part of the Warner Btother Archive Collection, is just so-so. The most important thing for classic films on DVD, is quality picture & sound. Many classic films are mastered to DVD using inferior film prints with scratched frames, and poorly mastered sound. The work done in mastering this film was good, but not great. The picture is clear, and the sound is crisp. There are very minute specs & spots on frames throughout, but this is absolutely minor (the clarity is probably slightly above average for a film its era). The sound is also well done, no hiss or exremely loud or quiet parts.The main drawback to this DVD is the bonus features. The packaging and artwork are minimal, and the DVD really has no bonus features unless you include the trailer, which is included on virtually all DVD's and costs almost nothing. This is a classic film that may be viewed on many different levels; audio commentary, production stills, isolated soundtrack, cast & production crew bios, and better artwork could have been provided at minimal cost. I paid $23 for this DVD, because I needed it for a presentation. It is out of print and becoming hard to find(unavailable on Netflix). My advice is to find a lightly used DVD to save yourself some money.",4,Classic film!

283415,A37XGUQ1VH0XM6,6301972228,"OAKSHAMAN ""oakshaman""","[49, 51]","This little film is really a remarkable artifact from 1950. There is an innocence to it that you couldn't recreate today. It manages to use a controversial theme like the voice of God manifesting over the radiowaves of the world over a six day period, yet there is no real partisan sense of controversy. You accept that it is really the voice of God. Moreover, there is no dogma attached- no mention of specific scriptures, or even specific prophets- just God speaking plainly for himself to the average man and woman. The message itself is no profound, radical, Last Days revelation- just a simple one of kindness, goodness, and love. Given the chaotic times that the world had just passed through, it makes sense that the message would be a calming and reassuring one. Any panic it causes in the story seems to be the result of the personal guilt and misunderstanding of the listeners.The secondary significance to this film is the perfect picture it paints of the its time. This was five years after the end of the war. The G.I.'s and defense workers were just beginning to settle into domesticity after some wild and scary times. Suburbia was just coming into existance. Nor was this a time of complacent prosperity- the average Joe was a factory worker that was under pressure to just get by. There are also all of the little things of typical American life- bowling with friends, listening to the radio (no television for the masses, yet), starters on the floorboards of cars, a husband going out for cigarettes (and asking his pregnant wife if she would like him to get her a pack....)Whitmore is perfect as Mr. Average Joe (Joe Smith, actually)- and is likeable and believable. Nowadays most people would classify him as a lower class, factory-working loser- but then he was Mr. Average American- the salt of the earth. His wife, Nancy Davis (Nancy Reagan) is the perfect stay at home, hard working, housewife (not yet a negative stereotype.) The son is as clean-cut an example of the all-American boy as you could wish. And yet, together, they never come across as phoney or contrived. Infact, they come across as far more real than the vast majority of families today.You never actually hear the actual voice of God, but this is for the best. An actual voice would have been a distraction and a let down compared to what the viewer can picture in his own mind and heart.
