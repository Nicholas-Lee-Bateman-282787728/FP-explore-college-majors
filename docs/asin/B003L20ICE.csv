1348368,AM18CU72YEWH5,B003L20ICE,A. J Terry,"[6, 8]","The film begins by establishing the relationships among an unconventional family: a lesbian couple and the son and daughter they have had with the aid of sperm donated by a stranger. The lesbian couple come across as rigid, judgmental, perfectionist in terms of their own and their kids' achievements, and quarrelsome between themselves. ""Intimate"" conversations between each other, and between them and the kids, sound like they're right out of the therapist's office or a self-help book.The older child, the daughter, has just turned 18. She and her brother agree to contact their biological father for the first time (they couldn't do it earlier because they were both under 18). The father turns out to be warm, easygoing, generous, and creative. He's established a successful restaurant, despite having dropped out of college. He's still single, and although initially confused, soon comes to love the idea of having kids.  He spends quality time with them, gives them good advice on their troubles, shoots hoops with the boy, and so on. He also gives one of the mothers her first job as a landscaper, fixing up his large but chaotic garden area. She's thrilled, and soon they find themselves attracted to each other. He also graciously puts up with the other member of the couple constantly insulting him.And if this had been a French movie, the father would have stayed in this family's lives, and the problem with his having a fling with one of the mothers would have resolved itself in a positive way.  Instead, the highly unpleasant set of ""American values"" the family represents is upheld only by throwing this guy out of their lives so they can all continue without having to really grow or change. The father is bewildered, hurt . . . after all, the kids contacted him, they asked him for advice on their lives, he fell in love with one of the women and she seemed to reciprocate--and then, a door is triumphantly slammed in his face and he's told that if he wants a family, he should go create his own.I really didn't like the message in this movie.",3,Not like a French movie after all,1308700800,"06 22, 2011",2011,2063,"['film', 'establishing', 'relationships', 'unconventional', 'family', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'son', 'daughter', 'have', 'had', 'aid', 'sperm', 'donated', 'stranger', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'come', 'rigid', 'judgmental', 'perfectionist', 'terms', 'own', 'kids', 'achievements', 'quarrelsome', 'Intimate', 'conversations', 'other', 'kids', 'sound', ""'re"", 'right', 'therapist', 'office', 'self-help', 'book.The', 'older', 'child', 'daughter', 'just', 'turned', '18', 'brother', 'agree', 'contact', 'biological', 'father', 'first', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'earlier', 'were', '18', 'father', 'out', 'be', 'warm', 'easygoing', 'generous', 'creative', 'established', 'successful', 'restaurant', 'having', 'dropped', 'college', 'still', 'single', 'initially', 'confused', 'soon', 'love', 'idea', 'having', 'kids', 'quality', 'time', 'good', 'advice', 'troubles', 'shoots', 'hoops', 'boy', 'so', 'also', 'one', 'mothers', 'first', 'job', 'landscaper', 'fixing', 'up', 'large', 'chaotic', 'garden', 'area', 'thrilled', 'soon', 'find', 'attracted', 'other', 'also', 'graciously', 'up', 'other', 'member', 'couple', 'constantly', 'insulting', 'him.And', 'had', 'been', 'French', 'movie', 'father', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'family', 'lives', 'problem', 'having', 'fling', 'one', 'mothers', 'would', 'have', 'resolved', 'positive', 'way', 'Instead', 'highly', 'unpleasant', 'set', 'American', 'values', 'family', 'upheld', 'only', 'throwing', 'guy', 'lives', 'can', 'continue', 'having', 'really', 'grow', 'change', 'father', 'bewildered', 'hurt', 'kids', 'contacted', 'asked', 'advice', 'lives', 'fell', 'love', 'one', 'women', 'seemed', 'reciprocate', 'then', 'door', 'triumphantly', 'slammed', 'face', 'told', 'family', 'should', 'go', 'create', 'own.I', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'message', 'movie']",N/A

The story is not new but the treatment is and the traditional family is replaced with the lesbian family dynamic. I liked the movie and it is about the bonds that tie us together which are family, children. When outside forces start to threaten this bond, we rise to defend these ties. This film was unique because of the lesbian angle, Annette Benning - the husband, and Julianne Moore her wife. Mark Ruffalo contributes what may be the most natural performance of his career. The young children are great as well. Julianne Moore is such a seasoned performer that she does not even have to try. Annette Benning, commands your attention that will surely make the final round of major award ceremonies this year. With minimal makeup and an expression for every situation, she rules the movie.

1348373,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003L20ICE,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","In a world where nearly every story line and plot point feels like an obvious clich&eacute;, it's nice to find a film that relishes inside those clich&eacute;s with such rich character development they transcend, becoming real and raw and honest and even, despite their apparent familiarity, fresh and exciting.Yes, `The Kids Are All Right' may appear on the outset to be a gigantic lump of clich&eacute;d material, masked over by the `modern twist' of a `modern family', but the heart of this film beats so naturally and so authentically you instantly forgive and even forget that you've, in a way, seen it all before.This is `that' good.The film considers the marital relationship between alpha-lesbian, Nic, and her supportive and somewhat neglected wife Jules.  Their relationship, while grounded in obvious love, is tested when their two children seek out their donor father when the eldest turns eighteen.  Joni and Laser (the children) are your typical teenage kids growing up in an anti-typical household.  They have their insecurities and longings and a deep need for some closure with regards to their `father'.  So, without parental consent, they seek out Paul; their fun loving, bed hopping father.  Paul, still very much a kid himself, approaches the situation with an obvious naivety, which is instantly appealing to his daughter Joni and her mother Jules.  Laser, and to a deeper extent Nic, are apprehensive, even distant; feeling that Paul is going to ruin their family dynamic.When tensions begin to mount, that premonition proves true.The film, as a whole, is about personal growth.  Every character has their personal epiphanies based on their newfound `family'.  Paul, the fifty-year-old bachelor, is beginning to doubt his life goals as he really connects to his paternal side.  Jules, seeing the carefree nature of Paul (something they share), begins to question her relationship with Nic, who has become even more overbearing and critical with Paul's presence.  Laser, who obviously longed for a father figure, begins to shape his identity as he observes who this man is and who he wants to emulate.Like I said; personal growth.The performances here are a figurative goldmine.  I mean, I can't really see Bening losing the Oscar at this point (even if she isn't my personal favorite in the film, she has OSCAR written all over this performance).  Everyone is so effortlessly natural and believable; even the children (played wonderfully by Josh Hutcherson and Mia Wasokowska).  For me, the film is all about the charismatic beauty that resides between Mark Ruffalo and Julianne Moore.  Together they make this film for me.  Ruffalo is an actor I have always really liked, and this is easily his grand opus.  Saying that sounds so odd, since this is such an internalized and quiet performance, one that is so natural and effortless that it could easily be passed over, beings that it isn't flashy.  That would be so sad, because Ruffalo creates such a genuine and real man in Paul.  My mind still recalls that initial phone call with his daughter; the way he stumbles through every word and his reaction to her nonchalance is just NOT fakable.  He really understood this character.  Moore layers all of Jules's complexities with such beauty and restraint.  Nothing is overworked and oversold.  You really see her for who she is, no gimmicks.  In fact, every single scene is played (by every actor) with such honesty, for face value.  The big surprise was Wasikowska (who, with any justice, will snag a surprise Supporting Actress Oscar nomination), who just finds such collective grace in her portrayal of the conflicted teen.That final scene, the quivering chin...just WOW.In the end I will just say that I am still quite smitten with this beautiful little film that understands its own direction and presents something intimate and sincere, finding the realistic tensions in life whilst remembering the beauty of the human smile; which is something I did a lot of while watching this movie.",5,This movie is more than all right...,1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,4015,"['world', 'where', 'nearly', 'story', 'line', 'plot', 'point', 'feels', 'obvious', 'clich', 'eacute', 'nice', 'find', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'such', 'rich', 'character', 'development', 'transcend', 'becoming', 'real', 'raw', 'honest', 'even', 'apparent', 'familiarity', 'fresh', 'exciting.Yes', 'Kids', 'Are', 'All', 'Right', 'may', 'appear', 'outset', 'be', 'gigantic', 'lump', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'material', 'masked', 'modern', 'twist', 'modern', 'family', 'heart', 'film', 'so', 'naturally', 'so', 'authentically', 'instantly', 'forgive', 'even', 'forget', ""'ve"", 'way', 'seen', 'before.This', 'good.The', 'film', 'marital', 'relationship', 'alpha-lesbian', 'Nic', 'supportive', 'somewhat', 'neglected', 'wife', 'Jules', 'relationship', 'grounded', 'obvious', 'love', 'tested', 'when', 'two', 'children', 'seek', 'out', 'donor', 'father', 'when', 'eldest', 'turns', 'eighteen', 'Joni', 'Laser', 'children', 'are', 'typical', 'teenage', 'kids', 'growing', 'up', 'anti-typical', 'household', 'have', 'insecurities', 'longings', 'deep', 'need', 'closure', 'regards', 'father', 'So', 'parental', 'consent', 'seek', 'out', 'Paul', 'fun', 'loving', 'bed', 'hopping', 'father', 'Paul', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'kid', 'situation', 'obvious', 'naivety', 'instantly', 'appealing', 'daughter', 'Joni', 'mother', 'Jules', 'Laser', 'deeper', 'extent', 'Nic', 'are', 'apprehensive', 'even', 'distant', 'feeling', 'Paul', 'going', 'ruin', 'family', 'dynamic.When', 'tensions', 'begin', 'mount', 'premonition', 'true.The', 'film', 'whole', 'personal', 'growth', 'Every', 'character', 'personal', 'epiphanies', 'based', 'newfound', 'family', 'Paul', 'fifty-year-old', 'bachelor', 'beginning', 'doubt', 'life', 'goals', 'really', 'paternal', 'side', 'Jules', 'seeing', 'carefree', 'nature', 'Paul', 'something', 'share', 'question', 'relationship', 'Nic', 'who', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'overbearing', 'critical', 'Paul', 'presence', 'Laser', 'who', 'obviously', 'longed', 'father', 'figure', 'shape', 'identity', 'who', 'man', 'who', 'emulate.Like', 'said', 'personal', 'growth.The', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'figurative', 'goldmine', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'Bening', 'losing', 'Oscar', 'point', 'even', ""n't"", 'personal', 'favorite', 'film', 'OSCAR', 'written', 'performance', 'Everyone', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'natural', 'believable', 'even', 'children', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Mia', 'Wasokowska', 'film', 'charismatic', 'beauty', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Together', 'make', 'film', 'Ruffalo', 'actor', 'have', 'always', 'really', 'liked', 'easily', 'grand', 'opus', 'Saying', 'so', 'odd', 'such', 'internalized', 'quiet', 'performance', 'one', 'so', 'natural', 'effortless', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'passed', 'beings', ""n't"", 'flashy', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'sad', 'Ruffalo', 'creates', 'such', 'genuine', 'real', 'man', 'Paul', 'mind', 'still', 'initial', 'phone', 'call', 'daughter', 'way', 'word', 'reaction', 'nonchalance', 'just', 'NOT', 'fakable', 'really', 'understood', 'character', 'Moore', 'layers', 'Jules', 'complexities', 'such', 'beauty', 'restraint', 'Nothing', 'overworked', 'oversold', 'really', 'see', 'who', 'gimmicks', 'fact', 'single', 'scene', 'played', 'actor', 'such', 'honesty', 'face', 'value', 'big', 'surprise', 'was', 'Wasikowska', 'who', 'justice', 'will', 'snag', 'surprise', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'who', 'just', 'finds', 'such', 'collective', 'grace', 'portrayal', 'conflicted', 'final', 'scene', 'quivering', 'chin', 'just', 'end', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'am', 'still', 'quite', 'smitten', 'beautiful', 'little', 'film', 'own', 'direction', 'presents', 'something', 'intimate', 'sincere', 'finding', 'realistic', 'tensions', 'life', 'whilst', 'remembering', 'beauty', 'human', 'smile', 'something', 'did', 'lot', 'watching', 'movie']",N/A
1348374,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B003L20ICE,Andy Orrock,"[1, 3]","I was excited to see this movie opening week for two reasons: I thought director/co-writer Lisa Cholodenko'sLaurel Canyonwas one of the most underrated films of the last 10 years, so I'll sign up for anything she does; and - like other fans ofIn Treatment: Season One- I felt privy to one of Hollywood's great secrets (you know, the awesomeness that is Mia Wasikowska).  That, plus there's the good-in-everything-he-does Mark Ruffalo, Annette Bening and Julianne Moore.  What's not to love?Over all, it's a good film, well told. The story by Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg shows a close family unit dealing with the same issues, pressures and transitions that all families must deal with...and I think that's the writers' main point: that despite the quote-unquote non-traditional aspects of this family, they're no different than any other. Ms. Wasikowska is, as expected, excellent (watch the way she trembles at the end as her parents drive away).  Annette Bening is superb, especially in the scene in which she dives into Joni Mitchell's ""All I Want"" a cappella in a dinner duet with Ruffalo's Paul (you slowly realize - as does Paul - that there's something deeper than a sing-along going on here).  [Despite getting an Academy Award nomination for this performance, I thought Bening was even better in last year'sMother and Child.]The one issue I have with the film is one expressed many times on these pages in loud, objectionable terms: that Moore's character - in a long, committed relationship with Bening's character -would flip (literally) so suddenly for Ruffalo.  That twist outraged many. Even though I don't have the emotional investment that many have in what that sequence represents, making that the story seems at best a questionable choice.",4,"As a fan of Lisa Cholodenko's and Mia Wasikowska's, I looked forward to this film",1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,1771,"['was', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'opening', 'week', 'two', 'reasons', 'thought', 'director/co-writer', 'Lisa', ""Cholodenko'sLaurel"", 'Canyonwas', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'films', 'last', '10', 'years', 'so', ""'ll"", 'sign', 'up', 'anything', 'other', 'fans', 'ofIn', 'Treatment', 'Season', 'One-', 'felt', 'privy', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'secrets', 'know', 'awesomeness', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'good-in-everything-he-does', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'What', 'not', 'love', 'good', 'film', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'Cholodenko', 'co-writer', 'Stuart', 'Blumberg', 'close', 'family', 'unit', 'dealing', 'same', 'issues', 'pressures', 'transitions', 'families', 'must', 'deal', 'think', 'writers', 'main', 'point', 'quote-unquote', 'non-traditional', 'aspects', 'family', ""'re"", 'different', 'other', 'Ms.', 'Wasikowska', 'expected', 'excellent', 'watch', 'way', 'end', 'parents', 'drive', 'away', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'superb', 'especially', 'scene', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'Want', 'cappella', 'dinner', 'duet', 'Ruffalo', 'Paul', 'slowly', 'realize', 'Paul', 'something', 'deeper', 'sing-along', 'going', 'here', 'getting', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'performance', 'thought', 'Bening', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'last', ""year'sMother"", 'Child', ']', 'one', 'issue', 'have', 'film', 'one', 'expressed', 'many', 'times', 'pages', 'loud', 'objectionable', 'terms', 'Moore', 'character', 'long', 'committed', 'relationship', 'Bening', 'character', '-would', 'flip', 'literally', 'so', 'suddenly', 'Ruffalo', 'twist', 'outraged', 'many', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotional', 'investment', 'many', 'have', 'what', 'sequence', 'making', 'story', 'best', 'questionable', 'choice']",N/A

Well the comedy comes in the way they interact with, not only each other, but their own children whenever the kids ask them questions pertaining to their sexual preferences.This is done in a way that seems inoffensive and harmless (though I suppose it's up for interpretation whether it really is or not) and there's actually some pretty clever scenes such as, for example, the two moms questioning their sons sexual preferences and automatically assuming that he's chosen a man and that he has some explaining to do when the one mom accidentally walked into his bedroom and noticed he was watching male pornography on his computer, however it turns out the male porn belonged to the two moms so THEY were actually the ones who had to explain it, lol.  I'm referring to the kitchen scene near the beginning.  It's hilarious!  Talk about turning the tables!Anyway the storyline is about the kids wanting to find their biological father (the sperm doner) so they do a little searching and when they find him... well it turns out he's doing pretty good for himself and gets along with the kids but I wouldn't call it a GREAT relationship.  As the one mom accurately says, ""he's too self-satisfied"" and believes in doing things his own way which can easily be interpreted as ""the lazy way"" or ""his way or the highway"".Eventually we discover that the one mom has a thing for this man, so they find sneaky ways to hide their sexual relationship through a supposed ""back yard decoration chore"" that the mom volunteered for, even though it's pretty obvious to the people working in the back yard that some hanky panky is taking place between the mom and the sperm doner, lol.  This relationship is what begins the increase in quality for me.  Before this... I'd say the movie wasn't really anything special.  Now however, they have to keep this knowledge hidden from the moms lesbian partner.I had to take one point away because there's some mild downtime in the beginning when really nothing of interest happens.  No character or storyline development takes place for several minutes at a time, and the discussion between the biological father and his kids was alright but occasionally the victim of hit-or-miss in the jokes department.  The second half of the movie when the one mom suspects the other one of cheating on her, along with the Joni Mitchell dinner table sing-along segment (and I'll have them know I'm a straight man who loves Joni's music!) is another noteworthy segment.Overall, the Kids Are All Right is funny and it's even touching (especially near th end when the daughter goes off to college).  Most importantly -and the reason I watched it in the first place- it's just plain different.  I prefer originality so having a lesbian couple raise their children was definitely a new storyline feature to me.

1348381,A30TQET02FLSUX,B003L20ICE,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[1, 2]","It's rare that I find a movie with a good adult laugh. My sense of humor is pretty dry, and most comedies nowadays seem to go more for toilet room and slapstick humor. But I was very pleasantly surprised by the intelligent, subtle, witty humor in The Kids Are All Right (2010). The film also has a good dose of drama, so it's really a dramedy that follows in the footsteps of the great television series M*A*S*H, combining laughs and tears with great effect for both. I'm shocked that I like The Kids Are All Right as much as I do! I was expecting it to be light and fluffy. And at times it is, but it also has great dramatic depth. I give the film 3.5 stars out of 5, and highly encourage you to check it out. It's one of the best and freshest films of 2010, as so many critics are pointing out.Director Lisa Cholodenko crafted this marvelous story about a modern family with two kids and two mothers from her own life experience, as is clearly obvious in the phenomenal writing and dialogue. Annette Bening and Julianne Moore are absolutely perfect and believable as a Lesbian couple who both get pregnant using the same sperm donor, and create their family of four. Mark Ruffalo plays the sperm donor and hopeful-father-to-be for Laser and Joni, played brilliantly by Josh Hutcherson and Mia Wasikowska. All five of these actors that make up this ensemble cast are at the top of their acting games. Bening and Moore both deserve Oscar nominations for their work here. Other than in American Beauty (1999), I've never seen Bening better. And I predict she finally wins her much deserved Oscar for her role as Nic in this film. The production design and cinematography are both excellent, showing how much can be done on what I'm sure was a tight budget. The sets and locations all work well in telling the story of the lives of these characters.What really got me in The Kids Are All Right, is how much I could see myself and my own life's journey in each and every one of these five characters. Regardless of their gender, age, or sexual orientation, each character has a piece of life to share with us and make us think and feel about. This is very much a family film, but without a pretentious agenda (I would argue) to promote or prove that gay and lesbian couples can have a marriage and a family just like straight couples. And yet it does prove that premise...at least to me. The love, structure, struggles, and all the other things that any family or marriage has, are all present in this family. The two major scenes where these five family members gather around the dinner table and have a ""family"" meal together are the absolute best parts of this movie. Each time, I felt fond memories of my own family's meals and the dynamics involved in the conversations between the people present. It's good stuff!! It's hard for me to share what got me about this film, other than all the little details and minutia of everyday life that come through in the characters and the story. They all add up so that by the end, you've gone on this journey of discovery about this family and the lives that make it up. As well as relived your own story. I remembered my own past experiences with growing up as a teenager, going off to college, learning about life, and maturing into an adult as I watched this film. I laughed at some of the obscure, ordinary, but funny moments that this film lives in. It's simply a great slice of modern American life...and yet it feels timeless because so much of life and family really never changes.",3,A great slice of modern American life,1292889600,"12 21, 2010",2010,3531,"['rare', 'find', 'movie', 'good', 'adult', 'laugh', 'sense', 'humor', 'pretty', 'dry', 'most', 'comedies', 'nowadays', 'seem', 'go', 'more', 'toilet', 'room', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'intelligent', 'subtle', 'witty', 'humor', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Right', '2010', 'film', 'also', 'good', 'dose', 'drama', 'really', 'dramedy', 'footsteps', 'great', 'television', 'series', 'M*A*S*H', 'combining', 'laughs', 'tears', 'great', 'effect', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'like', 'Kids', 'Are', 'All', 'Right', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'light', 'fluffy', 'times', 'also', 'great', 'dramatic', 'depth', 'give', 'film', '3.5', 'stars', '5', 'highly', 'encourage', 'check', 'out', 'one', 'best', 'freshest', 'films', '2010', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'are', 'pointing', 'out.Director', 'Lisa', 'Cholodenko', 'crafted', 'marvelous', 'story', 'modern', 'family', 'two', 'kids', 'two', 'mothers', 'own', 'life', 'experience', 'clearly', 'obvious', 'phenomenal', 'writing', 'dialogue', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'are', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'believable', 'Lesbian', 'couple', 'who', 'get', 'pregnant', 'using', 'same', 'sperm', 'donor', 'create', 'family', 'four', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'sperm', 'donor', 'hopeful-father-to-be', 'Laser', 'Joni', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'five', 'actors', 'make', 'up', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'are', 'top', 'acting', 'games', 'Bening', 'Moore', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'work', 'here', 'Other', 'American', 'Beauty', '1999', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Bening', 'better', 'predict', 'finally', 'much', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Nic', 'film', 'production', 'design', 'cinematography', 'are', 'excellent', 'showing', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'what', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'tight', 'budget', 'sets', 'locations', 'work', 'well', 'telling', 'story', 'lives', 'characters.What', 'really', 'got', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Right', 'how', 'much', 'could', 'see', 'own', 'life', 'journey', 'one', 'five', 'characters', 'Regardless', 'gender', 'age', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'character', 'piece', 'life', 'share', 'make', 'think', 'feel', 'about', 'very', 'much', 'family', 'film', 'pretentious', 'agenda', 'would', 'argue', 'promote', 'prove', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'couples', 'can', 'have', 'marriage', 'family', 'just', 'straight', 'couples', 'yet', 'prove', 'premise', 'least', 'love', 'structure', 'struggles', 'other', 'things', 'family', 'marriage', 'are', 'present', 'family', 'two', 'major', 'scenes', 'where', 'five', 'family', 'members', 'gather', 'dinner', 'table', 'have', 'family', 'meal', 'together', 'are', 'absolute', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'time', 'felt', 'fond', 'memories', 'own', 'family', 'meals', 'dynamics', 'involved', 'conversations', 'people', 'present', 'good', 'stuff', 'hard', 'share', 'what', 'got', 'film', 'other', 'little', 'details', 'minutia', 'everyday', 'life', 'come', 'characters', 'story', 'add', 'up', 'so', 'end', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'journey', 'discovery', 'family', 'lives', 'make', 'up', 'As', 'well', 'relived', 'own', 'story', 'remembered', 'own', 'past', 'experiences', 'growing', 'up', 'teenager', 'going', 'off', 'college', 'learning', 'life', 'maturing', 'adult', 'watched', 'film', 'laughed', 'obscure', 'ordinary', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'simply', 'great', 'slice', 'modern', 'American', 'life', 'yet', 'timeless', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'family', 'really', 'never', 'changes']",N/A

Then their children Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson) decide to seek out their Dad out of sheer curiosity during Joni's last month at home before she heads to college.

I would have preferred she stay with the natural drama inherent in the very situation itself of a sperm donor finally meeting the children he sired for two lesbians almost two decades ago.  The oldest child is set to go to college in a few weeks.  Thus the stage is set for everyone to meet Mark Ruffalo as the donor.  Julianne Moore and Annette Bening play the lesbian couple with Bening being a doctor and Moore the homemaker. Ruffalo owns a local restaurant.Where it veers in the wrong direction is an attraction which flares up between the male donor and one of the lesbian women.  Where it veers in the right direction is the inherent drama in finding out the missing link in your family's overall equation.  It is a tension fraught situation for everyone wondering how he will change their family and whether Pandora's Box has been opened or not.The film has a lot to say about nature vs. nurture.  It drives one of the mothers crazy that she starts recognizing the children in his gestures and movements.  The genetic stamp is there.  Yet the donor is a real goof off in comparison to the family unit.  The children have absorbed the advantages of having two highly educated and motivated mothers rearing them. They clearly do not have their father's attitude of ""wasting his time by going to college.""The law has been changing rapidly with its being harder and harder to keep biological parenting information secret.  We are clearly headed in the direction of most children knowing who and where biological parents are in almost every situation. Where this film is very good is in exploring the natural drama of what happens when a family has to start dealing with these issues now that the information is available.

It has some subtle messages around the concepts of family and affinity, loyalty and self-gratification, growth and pain. Sometimes these concepts are not easily explored in a motion picture because they impact us all at some point in our lives and they may seem like the ordinary challenges of life with others.  However, this film brings these issues to life with excellent actors and intelligent scripting and a somewhat unique context. By now everyone knows the story narrative around two middle-aged lesbians who have reared a daughter and son (now 18 and 15) and have an established family unit.  But for many lesbians that used a sperm donor bank, the curiosity of their children about the identity of their father is a expected and normal occurrence that may test their confidence as parents. In this story, the parents Nic (played by Annette Bening) and Jules (played by Julianna Moore) adjust to the idea of their children seeking out their natural father. Mark Ruffalo plays the role of Paul, their natural father, who provides an outstanding performance. Paul is a single man with a long string of girlfriends, current and past, who has never settled down to have a family of his own and really has not contemplated the impact a family might have upon his growth and personal well-being. He is contacted and in a casual way he increases his interactions with his children. He gradually falls in love with his own children and then gradually falls in love with the family in which they live. The mistake comes when he makes the error of sexualizing this personal contact with one of the two mothers in the family. I have said enough here since I don't want to spoil this excellent film for anyone.However, the film fully explores that building a family is not an easy task and it requires the utmost honesty, transparency, care, patience, understanding, and trust. Nic and Jules have worked for many years to build their family. Babies are born overnight but a family is built one day at a time, with many trials and tribulations, many of which are painful.Ruffalo, as Mark, demonstrates that a family, especially composed of one's own biological children is incredibly seductive for a man who never expected a family. His primary mistake is one of boundaries. He may find himself falling in love with his children, that is only natural, but he needed to respect the family boundary that Nic and Jules have painstakingly constructed with their children over the years. He really only has two choices. He can accept the boundaries of their family and support them as a family unit and/or he can go start a family of his own. He makes some painful mistakes in the film and is really left with few options.The film is about the integrity of the family unit, its fragility and strength, and its ability to forgive and repair. No wonder Mark is so attracted to it. You will be attracted to it too.",5,A film about the strength of families - all families,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,2952,"['film', 'excellent', 'highly', 'recommended', 'subtle', 'messages', 'concepts', 'family', 'affinity', 'loyalty', 'self-gratification', 'growth', 'pain', 'Sometimes', 'concepts', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'explored', 'motion', 'picture', 'impact', 'point', 'lives', 'may', 'seem', 'ordinary', 'challenges', 'life', 'others', 'However', 'film', 'issues', 'life', 'excellent', 'actors', 'intelligent', 'scripting', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'context', 'now', 'everyone', 'story', 'narrative', 'two', 'middle-aged', 'lesbians', 'who', 'have', 'reared', 'daughter', 'son', 'now', '18', '15', 'have', 'established', 'family', 'unit', 'many', 'lesbians', 'used', 'sperm', 'donor', 'bank', 'curiosity', 'children', 'identity', 'father', 'expected', 'normal', 'occurrence', 'may', 'test', 'confidence', 'parents', 'story', 'parents', 'Nic', 'played', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Jules', 'played', 'Julianna', 'Moore', 'adjust', 'idea', 'children', 'seeking', 'out', 'natural', 'father', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'role', 'Paul', 'natural', 'father', 'who', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Paul', 'single', 'man', 'long', 'string', 'girlfriends', 'current', 'past', 'who', 'never', 'settled', 'down', 'have', 'family', 'own', 'really', 'not', 'contemplated', 'impact', 'family', 'might', 'have', 'growth', 'personal', 'well-being', 'contacted', 'casual', 'way', 'interactions', 'children', 'gradually', 'love', 'own', 'children', 'then', 'gradually', 'love', 'family', 'live', 'mistake', 'when', 'error', 'sexualizing', 'personal', 'contact', 'one', 'two', 'mothers', 'family', 'have', 'said', 'enough', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'excellent', 'film', 'anyone.However', 'film', 'fully', 'building', 'family', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'utmost', 'honesty', 'transparency', 'care', 'patience', 'understanding', 'trust', 'Nic', 'Jules', 'have', 'worked', 'many', 'years', 'build', 'family', 'Babies', 'are', 'born', 'overnight', 'family', 'built', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'many', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'many', 'are', 'painful.Ruffalo', 'Mark', 'family', 'especially', 'composed', 'one', 'own', 'biological', 'children', 'incredibly', 'seductive', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'expected', 'family', 'primary', 'mistake', 'one', 'boundaries', 'may', 'find', 'falling', 'love', 'children', 'only', 'natural', 'needed', 'respect', 'family', 'boundary', 'Nic', 'Jules', 'have', 'painstakingly', 'constructed', 'children', 'years', 'really', 'only', 'two', 'choices', 'can', 'accept', 'boundaries', 'family', 'support', 'family', 'unit', 'can', 'go', 'start', 'family', 'own', 'painful', 'mistakes', 'film', 'really', 'left', 'few', 'options.The', 'film', 'integrity', 'family', 'unit', 'fragility', 'strength', 'ability', 'forgive', 'repair', 'wonder', 'Mark', 'so', 'attracted', 'will', 'be', 'attracted', 'too']",N/A

Jules has a dream of starting a landscaping business and Nic (having been through past similar situations with Jules) is less than supportive. Meanwhile their 15 year old son Laser wants to get in contact with his biological father, Paul (portrayed by Mark Ruffalo) and enlist his 18 year old sister Joni to contact the sperm bank and get the information (minors are not permitted to access such information).Joni and Laser end up meeting Paul and take an instant liking to him and develop a secret bond with him behind Nic and Jules's backs. Laser is forced to reveal the truth to Nic and Jules after being confronted about a friend of his. The 5 have a dinner together and Jules is as welcoming as Laser and Joni but Nic is less than warm. The conversation turns to Jules' business and Paul hires Jules to do his yard.One day working Jules confesses to Paul how Nic has never been 100% supportive of Jules' dreams and impulsively kisses him. This leads to an affair between the two. One night Nic decides to give Paul a chance and motions that they have dinner at his home (also to see Jules' work) and it seem to be working. While in the restroom Nic notices Jules' hair on a hairbrush and in the bathroom she confronts Jules who breaks down and admits to the affair.Tensions become high in the home as Laser and Joni turn against Jules and Paul (who wants Jules to leave Nic and take the kids and be with him but Jules is determined to win her family back). The night before Joni is to leave for college Jules sets her family down and begs for forgiveness saying ""marriage is work."" All 3 accompany Joni to her new school the next morning and share a tearful goodbye. With Laser in the backseat he says to Nic and Jules ""You guys shouldn't spilt up. You're too old."" Nic and Jules look in the rear viewed mirror and share a giggle as they hold hands driving off.Overall a FABULOUS movie. Great script, great story, and great performances. I HIGHLY recommend it!

1348391,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003L20ICE,Chris Pandolfi,"[16, 24]","""The Kids are All Right"" is one of the most honest and intelligent films about family, relationships, and the institution of marriage you're likely to see or have ever seen. That the central characters are a lesbian couple doesn't matter in the slightest. Director/co-writer Lisa Cholodenko doesn't sermonize about homophobia or civil unions or moral values, but rather presents a sincere, complex, and universal portrayal an American family - imperfect and at times highly turbulent, but still loving and committed. There's no trace of Hollywood idealism; rather, there's the sense that we're seeing real people living real lives with real ups and downs. Movies like this have to be treasured. They show respect for the audience. They involve you rather than make you feel like an outsider.At the center of the plot are Nic (Annette Benning) and Jules (Julianne Moore), who have been married for a number of years and have raised two children, one born to each and conceived via an anonymous sperm donor. Despite their relatively normal upbringing, the half siblings - fifteen-year-old Laser (Josh Hutcherson) and eighteen-year-old Joni (Mia Wasikowska), are curious about their biological father and decide to contact him through the sperm bank. Here enters Paul (Mark Ruffalo), the casual, relaxed, super cool owner of a restaurant serving organic food he has grown and harvested himself. He seems to like the kids. The kids seem to like him. The moms think he's a little too pleased with himself, what with the way he describes his own success as the result of doing, not learning.Nic, a doctor who has always been the dominant provider, slowly begins to feel as if her world is being stolen away, the kids spending more time with Paul than she's comfortable with. She drinks wine excessively. She has to be in control of every situation. Jules, less focused but more nurturing than Nic, begins to feel underappreciated, especially now that she has started a landscaping business. As it so happens, her first client is Paul, a turn of events that ties into a reality rarely discussed in the movies but is wisely observed here: Human sexuality is complicated, few falling into definite black and white categories. To say anything more would be too revealing, although I will say that, whatever happens, Paul will be cool with it. Others will be terribly confused. Others still will be hurt very deeply.The characters, written and played with sharp humor and heart, all have qualities that are not only realistic but relatable as well. Nic and Jules love their children and they each other, but as they eventually come to realize, marriage is hard and subject to unexpected turns. Who's to say who was right and who was wrong in any given situation? It's not as clear cut as it might seem. Joni, now a legal adult and on the verge of moving away to college, is incredibly smart, although she feels pressured into being the perfect child of a lesbian couple, and she has not yet acted upon her own emerging sexuality. Laser, less bookish but greatly athletic, has trouble finding that fine line between an adrenaline rush and acts of sheer stupidity. This is especially true when in the presence of his friend, who everyone else correctly writes off as a loser and a bad influence.As for Paul, there always seems to be someone like him in our lives. He's easy-going and open, although he doesn't always think before he acts. Why, for example, did he decide to donate sperm in the first place? Laser really would like to know. He puts a lot of selfless words in his answer, although one gets the sense that he doesn't really know why he did it. Maybe it just seemed like a good idea at the time. Maybe he's the kind of person that will try almost anything once if it seems fun enough. He's done many things in his life, but at this stage, he's cool with running an organic restaurant. Will he be cool with it a year from now? Five years? Ten? He says at one point that he would like a family someday, although he doesn't strike me as someone who thinks that far in advance. He lives for the moment. Unfortunately, that may do more harm than good when it comes to Joni and Laser - he's their biological father, but he's not their dad.The film is both funny and dramatic, and yet Cholodenko correctly avoids going too far in either direction. It doesn't condescend. It doesn't emotionally manipulate. It allows the characters and situations to evolve smoothly and naturally, so that by the end, I felt as if I had experienced something truly profound. It helps that that the performances are some of the best of any I've seen so far this year. Benning and Moore are completely believable in their roles, developed not as tiresome gay stereotypes but as actual people in a long-term relationship; they're not without their flaws, but underneath it all, they're well-meaning and decent. Wasikowska and Hutcherson play teenagers I could truly care about, both having personalities that felt genuine. Ruffalo is in top form, convincingly playing a character that, like a lot of us, has yet to figure things out. ""The Kids are All Right"" is a real winner - one of the year's best films.",5,Marriage and Family are Universal Challenges,1278979200,"07 13, 2010",2010,5179,"['Kids', 'are', 'Right', 'one', 'most',

The movie was entertaining and it kept my attention. I'm just not convinced that its the ground breaking movie that the critics have been trying to make it out to be.I've seen this type of movie many times before. A happy family is living the good life. The ""parents"", although different in personality and ambition, are a functional and happily married couple. They have two really good kids who seem to be happy. The wrinkle(there is always a wrinkle) is that the two children are byproducts of artificial insemination.  Yes, their parents are two gay women. Twenty years ago, a movie such as this may have been a seminal movie that was capable of inciting vigorous debate about a controversial social issue, like the criticism of Murphy Brown did in the 80's after Dan Quayle criticized her show because it focused on single motherhood. The problem with this movie is that its general plot is not all that new. This type of movie has been done before, and it has been done a lot better. Maybe the circumstances of the characters have changed, but the alternative circumstances of characters did not add to the originality of the film.The principle players in the film are all proficient in their roles; however, I cannot honestly say that anyone really stood out in this film. And yet Mark Ruffalo and Annette Benning receive Oscar nominations for their performances. They have both been in movies in which they have performed better. Julianne Moore is good, but she hardly stood out. And the kids were the kids. Perfectly serviceable, but again not great. So I fail to see what is so good about this movie.Also, I would think that if you were a gay woman you might be somewhat offended by this film. Julianne Moore is in a committed relationship with another woman for years, and then all of sudden a male paramour suddenly enters  her life and she forgets that she is a lesbian and starts to have sex with the male. This was an unbelievable plot twist.So, see the movie on Blue Ray or DVD if you want to. Like I've  said before you won't be bored.

There is a fair amount of humor, good drama with amazing acting performances, twists and lies that keep you interested, and 3 Academy award nominees all in the same movie. Nonetheless it is impressive. I do personally think the film ended semi-abruptly, but no biggy. I just would've liked maybe another ten minute or so to give a better wrap up, is all. I also like Mrs. Bening the most out of everyone's performance and can see how she got a golden globe for best actress with this flick. On the other hand, many may remember that this movie won a golden globe for best comedy. Nothing against the film, but it definitely more of a dramedy than an actualy comedy.

I liked the film, the plot, the acting, and the general premise of ""a normal gay/lesbian suburban family"".What I found fascinating was Annette Bennings' role as the MALE or HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.  What one sees and finds fascinating is 'the maleness' she portrays, no doubt what she sees with all the males she connects with, a womans' view of what men are and their predictable reactions.  She plays the character to perfection, as she is capable of.  The problem is that the images are generic, simplistic, and stereotypical (also wry and humorous).  I could see myself being viewed this way but I didn't feel my maleness captured.  Some women friends, asked what makes a man different from a woman, reply 'a certain perversity to their character, and words similar.  She was 'HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD' trying to play 'MALE'.The greatness of Stepford Wives was the inability of men to be able to craft a 'perfect woman', either version of the film.

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[0, 0]","The nuclear family takes on a different spin when both parents are same sex and the kids are the product of a male sperm donor in The Kids Are All Right.  When traumatic upheaval and revelations strike such a family, the results can be amusing and also tragic.  Annette Bening and Julianne Moore highlight an insightful script about domesticity turned on its head.Nic (Bening) and Jules (Moore) are lesbian parents of two teens, Joni and Laser.  One day the children research and contact their biological father, Paul (Mark Ruffalo), who agrees to meet his progeny.  After an awkward first meeting, things actually go well as the new family connections are explored by the kids and their newly found father.  The couple of Nic and Jules are a contrast; Nic is the physician who is totally controlling while Jules is still trying to find herself with a new business of landscaping.  Laser hangs with the wrong crowd and begins to realize that he deserves better through his bond with Paul.  Joni is trying to assert herself as an adult and prepares to go to college.  The moms show a parental responsibility to watch over their children and want to meet the dad.  When Paul hires Jules to do work on his restaurant landscape, the two connect.  As Paul's influence begins to overcome the family, Nic feels left out.  But there is an attraction between Jules and Paul that leads to a torrid affair, and when Nic discovers the truth, the family is torn apart.  Into this mix are two maturing children whose emotions will be tested throughout.The roles are well acted especially by Benning as a betrayed spouse, and in particular, her scene of revelation about Jules is a marvel of expressiveness and devastating heartbreak.  This culminates in a powerful moment with all the principals present at Paul's dinner table.  Moore gives solid support and shines in her heartfelt plea to her family near the end.  The ensemble is well cast particularly Ruffalo whose almost bystander role is suddenly elevated to catalyst and disruptor of the family's dynamic.The story has a nice balance of serious tones and comedic elements born out of the situations.  The themes work on several levels like ingredients of a zesty recipe: the family chemistry, the couple of Nic and Jules, the kids' developing bond with Paul, Paul and Jules, and shake and mix well.  Everyone has needs and wants, and the strongest is a need to belong to a family and the need to connect with another human being whether it be Laser and his friends, Paul and Jules, Paul and his children, and Nic and Jules.  Amid the conflicts, no one escapes unscathed.  There are no real heroes or villains here, only hard truths about life and relationships.The fact that two lesbians are having the conflict over infidelity may seem novel on the surface, but it could easily have been a heterosexual couple.  In fact the notion of two lesbians virtually disappears as we witness and understand this family unit with its warts and all.  It could be any family when you think about it.  The fact that both Benning and Moore play their respective spousal roles so convincingly is a testament to their acting skills playing off an excellent script by Stuart Blumberg and Lisa Cholodenko, who also directs.  The ending rings true and shows not only how far the relationships have come, but how that foundation, despite some serious challenges, is strong enough to survive.  Life moves on, and there is hope for the future.There are not a lot of loose ends in this story although, toward the end, it would be nice to get a bit more resolution to Ruffalo's character.  The film does contains a couple of brief explicit sex scenes without which this would essentially be a PG rated film.  There is little to quibble about, and the viewer gets to experience one of the more insightful domestic dramas in recent years.",4,Domestic Life in THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,3856,"['nuclear', 'family', 'different', 'spin', 'when', 'parents', 'are', 'same', 'sex', 'kids', 'are', 'product', 'male', 'sperm', 'donor', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Right', 'When', 'traumatic', 'upheaval', 'revelations', 'strike', 'family', 'results', 'can', 'be', 'amusing', 'also', 'tragic', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'highlight', 'insightful', 'script', 'domesticity', 'turned', 'head.Nic', 'Bening', 'Jules', 'Moore', 'are', 'lesbian', 'parents', 'two', 'teens', 'Joni', 'Laser', 'One', 'day', 'children', 'research', 'contact', 'biological', 'father', 'Paul', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'meet', 'progeny', 'awkward', 'first', 'meeting', 'things', 'actually', 'go', 'well', 'new', 'family', 'connections', 'are', 'explored', 'kids', 'newly', 'found', 'father', 'couple', 'Nic', 'Jules', 'are', 'contrast', 'Nic', 'physician', 'who', 'totally', 'controlling', 'Jules', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'new', 'business', 'landscaping', 'Laser', 'wrong', 'crowd', 'realize', 'better', 'bond', 'Paul', 'Joni', 'trying', 'assert', 'adult', 'prepares', 'go', 'college', 'moms', 'show', 'parental', 'responsibility', 'watch', 'children', 'want', 'meet', 'dad', 'When', 'Paul', 'Jules', 'do', 'work', 'restaurant', 'landscape', 'two', 'connect', 'Paul', 'influence', 'overcome', 'family', 'Nic', 'feels', 'left', 'out', 'attraction', 'Jules', 'Paul', 'torrid', 'affair', 'when', 'Nic', 'truth', 'family', 'torn', 'apart', 'Into', 'mix', 'are', 'two', 'maturing', 'children', 'emotions', 'will', 'be', 'tested', 'throughout.The', 'roles', 'are', 'well', 'acted', 'especially', 'Benning', 'betrayed', 'spouse', 'particular', 'scene', 'revelation', 'Jules', 'marvel', 'expressiveness', 'devastating', 'heartbreak', 'powerful', 'moment', 'principals', 'present', 'Paul', 'dinner', 'table', 'Moore', 'solid', 'support', 'shines', 'heartfelt', 'plea', 'family', 'end', 'ensemble', 'well', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Ruffalo', 'almost', 'bystander', 'role', 'suddenly', 'elevated', 'catalyst', 'disruptor', 'family', 'dynamic.The', 'story', 'nice', 'balance', 'serious', 'tones', 'comedic', 'elements', 'born', 'situations', 'themes', 'work', 'several', 'levels', 'ingredients', 'zesty', 'recipe', 'family', 'chemistry', 'couple', 'Nic', 'Jules', 'kids', 'developing', 'bond', 'Paul', 'Paul', 'Jules', 'shake', 'mix', 'well', 'Everyone', 'needs', 'strongest', 'need', 'belong', 'family', 'need', 'connect', 'human', 'being', 'be', 'Laser', 'friends', 'Paul', 'Jules', 'Paul', 'children', 'Nic', 'Jules', 'Amid', 'conflicts', 'one', 'unscathed', 'are', 'real', 'heroes', 'villains', 'here', 'only', 'hard', 'truths', 'life', 'relationships.The', 'fact', 'two', 'lesbians', 'are', 'having', 'conflict', 'infidelity', 'may', 'seem', 'novel', 'surface', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'heterosexual', 'couple', 'fact', 'notion', 'two', 'lesbians', 'virtually', 'witness', 'understand', 'family', 'unit', 'warts', 'could', 'be', 'family', 'when', 'think', 'fact', 'Benning', 'Moore', 'play', 'respective', 'spousal', 'roles', 'so', 'convincingly', 'testament', 'acting', 'skills', 'playing', 'off', 'excellent', 'script', 'Stuart', 'Blumberg', 'Lisa', 'Cholodenko', 'who', 'also', 'ending', 'rings', 'true', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'far', 'relationships', 'have', 'come', 'how', 'foundation', 'serious', 'challenges', 'strong', 'enough', 'survive', 'Life', 'hope', 'future.There', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'loose', 'ends', 'story', 'end', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'resolution', 'Ruffalo', 'character', 'film', 'couple', 'brief', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'would', 'essentially', 'be', 'PG', 'rated', 'film', 'little', 'quibble', 'viewer', 'experience', 'one', 'more', 'insightful', 'domestic', 'dramas', 'recent', 'years']",N/A

Although this is an ensemble cast movie, I think Annette Bening deserves most of the credit for her marvelous potrayal of  Nic.  Annette Bening & Julianne Moore play Nic & Jules, a middle-aged lesbian couple with two children (conceived from a sperm donor).  Nic (Bening) is a doctor.  Jules (Moore) is a landscape designer.  They have a loving and happy life with their two grown children; Joni (Mia Wasikowska) & Laser (Josh Hutcherson).  But, their lives are disrupted when Joni & Laser decide to contact their sperm donor father; Paul (Mark Ruffalo).  That's the basic premise.  But, there is so much more to the story.  Laser (Hutcherson) has a friend, Clay (Eddie Hassell), who seems hell-bent on dangerous stunts, destroying property, and general teenage self-destruction.  Paul (Ruffalo) is an aimless man, currently involved with a very sexy and beautiful free-spirited woman; Tanya (Yaya Alafia), until he meets his biological kids and Nic & Jules.  At first, Nic welcomes him into their lives, until Paul has an affair with Jules.  This is where the story gets intense... the tearing apart of the close-knit bond between Nic & Jules, and their children.  As I said, Bening is marvelous in her performance.  Moore is also very good, though the filmmakers chose to film her in a way to accent every freckle, every wrinkle, and cause her to look flabby, sickly pale and generally haggard; despite that in reality, she is a beautiful woman with a great body.  Speaking purely in opinion; I think Paul is an idiot for abandoning the great relationship he had with the sexy and beautiful Tanya in order to pursue an affair/relationship with Jules, a confirmed lesbian.  But, of course, it's necessary to the plot, as this affair is what tears the family apart.

1348399,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,B003L20ICE,Danny G.,"[2, 6]","""The Kids Are All Right"" has humor, power, insight and helps to remind us what a family is really all about. It's also a cautionary tale: Passionate sex, by its self, does not automatically make for a good relationship. Strong feelings can overpower our better judgment. Being dishonest with those we love causes a lot of suffering, but it can be a forgivable offense. A long-term relationship is a big investment - emotionally, financially and spiritually and it should not be easily discarded when something substantial goes wrong. Same-sex couples can have the exact same problems opposite-sex couples do.One other lesson one can learn from this delightful film is that filmmakers can do a decent job when the central theme of a story is about a same-sex couple. ""The Kids Are All Right"" proves Hollywood can make a enjoyable film about gay, lesbian, bi-sexual or transgendered people without it having to be violent, depressing or insulting!

Homework still needs to be done, teen angst and restlessness still need to be nurtured and addressed, and partners--after years and years of being together--still get on one another's nerves.  Thus we have Nic and Jules (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore), and their two (artifically inseminated) children, Joni and Laser (Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson), in what on its face appears to be an idyllic family setting, with Nic the breadwinner and Jules more or less maintaining the home front; but once the kiddos decide it's time to meet Paul, their biological father (Mark Ruffalo), this family dynamic suddenly flips onto its dysfunctional ear.  Accordingly the film becomes humorous, poignant, and compelling--all at once.The complexity of the characters (or, in Paul's case, the remarkable lack thereof) lends solid believability to the story, with Jules trying to establish her own identity beyond Nic's authoritative shadow; meanwhile Nic needs to learn to chill the forkle out.  Paul is such a free spirit he instantly attracts the attention of the children--then Jules; once the family is in disarray the viewer wonders if the pieces can be put back together, or if the damage is irreparable.  Indeed there is a resolution, of sorts, with Paul a red herring scapegoat, yet THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT strikes a cumulative chord of bonding and love, transcending orientation or societal bias.--D.

1348406,A11C43I615R52G,B003L20ICE,"Don Vito Corleone ""The Joker""","[3, 4]","The Kids are all Right is the best comedy I've seen. Is not a laugh per minute comedy like The Hangover or Tropic Thunder, is a more subdue one that also has its elements of drama. This is a story of two ""moms"" who have two kids and live as a family. Everything seems to be okay until the kids meet the sperm donor and things get complicated.This movie could easily be called a movie about a lesbian couple with kids but it's not. It's about family and marriage in general regardless the gender of the parents. There are many situations in the film that any family experiences (gay or straight). Lisa Cholodenko's script is brilliant and handles this in a masterful way. The movie could have been seem as a ""message movie"" about gay rights but it's nothing of the sort. Is much more simple and at the same time complicated. The movie deals with themes like rutine, raising children, letting go, infidelity, recovery and a lot more. ""marriage is hard"" says Jules one of the ""moms"" and she's right there are ups and lows in every relationship and to keep the spark alive requires sacrifices. This movie is witty, emotional, and funny. It's no wonder why it got all the accolades it got. It deserved it. Also the cast is superb with the three leads Annette Bening, Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo giving outstanding performances in their respective roles. The Kids are all Right is a great film and one of the best of last year.The Blu-ray offers great picture and audio quality. Being an independent comedy, don't expect colors popping out of your screen but the picture is solid, contrast is sharp and detail is really good. Audio is also crisp and clear with a 5.1 DTS-HD master audio that won't rock your house but serves the film in an excellent way.Unfortunately, while the BD has great P/A quality, there's no much in terms of bonus features. One would think that with all the positive reviews and awards that the film got, Universal will make a much worthier release. Instead you have three really short featurettes about the film that are promotional and never got in depth about the story, characters or anything. The best bonus feature is an audiocomentary provided by the director Lisa Cholodenko.The Kids are All Right is a superb smart picture that has a great story, an outstanding script and a brilliant cast. The BD offers excellent picture and audio but the bonus material is a dissapointment. Anyway, the movie is so great that this set is completely recommended.",5,Excellent film about family,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,2479,"['Kids', 'are', 'Right', 'best', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'laugh', 'minute', 'comedy', 'Hangover', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'more', 'subdue', 'one', 'also', 'elements', 'drama', 'story', 'two', 'moms', 'who', 'have', 'two', 'kids', 'live', 'family', 'Everything', 'be', 'okay', 'kids', 'meet', 'sperm', 'donor', 'things', 'get', 'complicated.This', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'called', 'movie', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'kids', 'not', 'family', 'marriage', 'general', 'regardless', 'gender', 'parents', 'are', 'many', 'situations', 'film', 'family', 'experiences', 'gay', 'straight', 'Lisa', 'Cholodenko', 'script', 'brilliant', 'masterful', 'way', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'seem', 'message', 'movie', 'gay', 'rights', 'nothing', 'sort', 'much', 'more', 'simple', 'same', 'time', 'complicated', 'movie', 'deals', 'themes', 'rutine', 'raising', 'children', 'letting', 'go', 'infidelity', 'recovery', 'lot', 'more', 'marriage', 'hard', 'Jules', 'one', 'moms', 'right', 'are', 'ups', 'lows', 'relationship', 'keep', 'spark', 'alive', 'sacrifices', 'movie', 'witty', 'emotional', 'funny', 'wonder', 'why', 'got', 'accolades', 'got', 'deserved', 'Also', 'cast', 'superb', 'three', 'leads', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'giving', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'respective', 'roles', 'Kids', 'are', 'Right', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'last', 'year.The', 'Blu-ray', 'offers', 'great', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'Being', 'independent', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'colors', 'popping', 'screen', 'picture', 'solid', 'contrast', 'sharp', 'detail', 'really', 'good', 'Audio', 'also', 'crisp', 'clear', '5.1', 'DTS-HD', 'master', 'audio', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rock', 'house', 'film', 'excellent', 'way.Unfortunately', 'BD', 'great', 'P/A', 'quality', 'much', 'terms', 'bonus', 'features', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'positive', 'reviews', 'awards', 'film', 'got', 'Universal', 'will', 'make', 'much', 'worthier', 'release', 'Instead', 'have', 'three', 'really', 'short', 'featurettes', 'film', 'are', 'promotional', 'never', 'got', 'depth', 'story', 'characters', 'anything', 'best', 'bonus', 'feature', 'audiocomentary', 'provided', 'director', 'Lisa', 'Cholodenko.The', 'Kids', 'are', 'All', 'Right', 'superb', 'smart', 'picture', 'great', 'story', 'outstanding', 'script', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'BD', 'excellent', 'picture', 'audio', 'bonus', 'material', 'dissapointment', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'so', 'great', 'set', 'completely', 'recommended']",N/A

The film takes a long hard look at Paul's relationship to the family he never knew about - not until the children decide to get in touch with him - and how his desire to obtain a ready-made family is ultimately frustrated.  He turns out to be too self-centered to understand how others feel.  Likewise Nic finds out to her cost that, despite her privileged existence as a doctor, her loved ones need a little more time and space in which to grow than she is prepared to allow them.  Lisa Cholodenko's film never allows viewers any respite; her camera focuses in detail on each character's reaction to one another, as well as giving us an insight into their inner thoughts.

1348408,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B003L20ICE,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[0, 0]","This review is from: The Kids Are All Right (DVD)""The Kids are All Right,"" directed and co-written by Lisa Cholodenko, is the story of Jules (Julianne Moore) and Nic (Annette Bening), the mothers of two children, a son named Laser, and a daughter, Joni. Now that Joni has turned eighteen, she is preparing to go away to college. Before she leaves, Laser urges her to learn the identity of their biological father, a sperm donor chosen by Nic and Jules. Joni gets the information with relative ease, and soon, she and her brother meet Paul (Mark Ruffalo).Cholodenko, who is gay and has a child with her partner, understands the dynamics of this unconventional household. Nic and Jules, like any married couple, have begun to bicker over small things. Nic, a physician, is brittle and controlling. Jules, who is softer and more subservient, wishes that she had developed herself professionally; she is tired of being looked upon as little more than a housewife. However, the two women are united in their concern for Joni and Laser, whom they treat with firmness tempered by unconditional love.Paul is the catalyst for a crisis that could undo Nic and Jules. Not only does this motorcycle riding, ingratiating, and laid-back restaurateur capture the kids' hearts, but he comes between Nic and Jules. If the ""moms"" send him packing, Laser and Joni will be angry and resentful, but should Nic and Jules allow Paul to barge in and destroy what has taken them years to build?All of the actors are terrific. Bening, as the edgy and bossy Nic, tries to hide her vulnerability, and Ruffalo almost steals the film with his charisma and easygoing charm. Moore is confused as a woman who is having a midlife crisis and is going a bit crazy. The profanity and explicit sexuality are off-putting at times, and the generally strong script has Jules behaving in a way that is not entirely believable. Still, there is warmth, wit, humor, and depth in this film that effectively conveys a universal truth: The bonds in any nuclear family may be strong, but they are not unbreakable.

1348409,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B003L20ICE,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 7]","Nora Ephron could take a few cues from Lisa Cholodenko (Laurel Canyon) on how to write and direct a movie about a recognizable human dilemma and the characters who have to deal with it. Now that I have seen this 2010 dramedy, I feel that this is basically the film that Ephron was trying to make with her 2009 Meryl Streep vehicle,It's Complicated, a far more conventional comedy that took a long-estranged couple and threw a monkey wrench into their arrangement by introducing a plot device that had them reigniting embers they didn't realize still existed between them. In Cholodenko's film, the situation appears more unique - the long-standing couple, Jules and Nic, is lesbian, and the complicating factor is Paul, the common biological father who provided the sperm that produced their two children, Nic's 18-year-old daughter Joni and Jules' 15-year-old son Laser.Ironically, however, the treatment here, co-written with Stuart Blumberg, is far more textured and universal than in Ephron's dependence on tired stereotypes and slapstick. The superb performances don't hurt either. The multi-layered story feels like a series of illuminations about these five characters. It begins when Joni and Laser decide to track down their sperm donor father without consulting their mothers. Paul turns out to be an easygoing, LA-style restaurateur and organic farmer, and as he begins to insinuate himself into the family's life, the director exposes the confused feelings of a family toward someone who's intractably part of them yet a complete stranger. Jules is intrigued, while Nic is suspicious and increasingly angry at someone she views as an interloper. At the same time, Cholodenko focuses attention on how Joni and Laser discover themselves sexually in a gay family with much of the comedy comes at the expense of Nic and Jules, who spice up their sex life with gay porn.Without resorting to stereotypes, the film succeeds in making this family seem quite ordinary with the kids constantly embarrassed by their moms' emotionalism and need for order. Jules and Nic have a marriage that looks like any straight one of twenty years duration. A certain brittleness has crept into Annette Bening's work of late, although the approach works well in her well-etched portrayal of Nic. She has a particularly strong dinner table scene where she is finally seduced by Paul's laid-back charms, sings a woozy rendition of Joni Mitchell's ""All I Want"", makes a shocking discovery in the bathroom, and then returns to the table in an engulfing haze of silent disappointment. As Paul, Mark Ruffalo appears to be doing a variation of the ne'er-do-well character he played inYou Can Count on Mebut gives him a shaggy, SoCal veneer of materialistic success.In a turn that reminds me a bit ofAnnie Hall-circa Diane Keaton, Julianne Moore plays the character that experiences the biggest arc in the story - nurturing and self-reflective one minute, spontaneous and regretful the next. For an actress often at home in period roles that require her to express repression, this feels like her most liberating work. As Joni, Mia Wasikowska - superb in Tim Burton's redux ofAlice in Wonderlandearlier this year - has the coltish manner of a young Gwyneth Paltrow and brings lucidity to her maturing character. Growing up from his cherubic turns inLittle ManhattanandBridge to Terabithia, Josh Hutcherson appears to be graduating to troubled adolescent roles with ease. Yaya DaCosta is so strikingly beautiful as the girl Paul conveniently keeps at bay that you almost overlook the serene presence she brings to her scenes. Cholodenko has no problem filming graphic lovemaking scenes, and they don't feel gratuitous to the story. It's rare when a film manages to be funny, mature and involving as this one does.",5,"Cholodenko's Funny, Mature Look at a Nuclear Family Has Universal Appeal",1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,3791,"['Nora', 'Ephron', 'could', 'take', 'few', 'cues', 'Lisa', 'Cholodenko', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'how', 'write', 'direct', 'movie', 'recognizable', 'human', 'dilemma', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'deal', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', '2010', 'dramedy', 'feel', 'basically', 'film', 'Ephron', 'was', 'trying', 'make', '2009', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'vehicle', 'Complicated', 'far', 'more', 'conventional', 'comedy', 'took', 'long-estranged', 'couple', 'threw', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'arrangement', 'introducing', 'plot', 'device', 'had', 'reigniting', 'embers', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'still', 'existed', 'Cholodenko', 'film', 'situation', 'more', 'unique', 'long-standing', 'couple', 'Jules', 'Nic', 'lesbian', 'complicating', 'factor', 'Paul', 'common', 'biological', 'father', 'who', 'provided', 'sperm', 'produced', 'two', 'children', 'Nic', '18-year-old', 'daughter', 'Joni', 'Jules', '15-year-old', 'son', 'Laser.Ironically', 'however', 'treatment', 'here', 'co-written', 'Stuart', 'Blumberg', 'far', 'more', 'textured', 'universal', 'Ephron', 'dependence', 'tired', 'stereotypes', 'slapstick', 'superb', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either', 'multi-layered', 'story', 'feels', 'series', 'illuminations', 'five', 'characters', 'when', 'Joni', 'Laser', 'decide', 'track', 'down', 'sperm', 'donor', 'father', 'consulting', 'mothers', 'Paul', 'out', 'be', 'easygoing', 'LA-style', 'restaurateur', 'organic', 'farmer', 'insinuate', 'family', 'life', 'director', 'confused', 'feelings', 'family', 'someone', 'who', 'intractably', 'part', 'yet', 'complete', 'stranger', 'Jules', 'intrigued', 'Nic', 'suspicious', 'increasingly', 'angry', 'someone', 'interloper', 'same', 'time', 'Cholodenko', 'attention', 'how', 'Joni', 'Laser', 'discover', 'sexually', 'gay', 'family', 'much', 'comedy', 'expense', 'Nic', 'Jules', 'who', 'spice', 'up', 'sex', 'life', 'gay', 'porn.Without', 'resorting', 'stereotypes', 'film', 'making', 'family', 'seem', 'quite', 'ordinary', 'kids', 'constantly', 'embarrassed', 'moms', 'emotionalism', 'need', 'order', 'Jules', 'Nic', 'have', 'marriage', 'straight', 'one', 'twenty', 'years', 'duration', 'certain', 'brittleness', 'crept', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'work', 'late', 'approach', 'well', 'well-etched', 'portrayal', 'Nic', 'particularly', 'strong', 'dinner', 'table', 'scene', 'where', 'finally', 'seduced', 'Paul', 'laid-back', 'charms', 'woozy', 'rendition', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'Want', 'shocking', 'discovery', 'bathroom', 'then', 'returns', 'table', 'engulfing', 'haze', 'silent', 'disappointment', 'Paul', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'be', 'doing', 'variation', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'character', 'played', 'inYou', 'Can', 'Count', 'Mebut', 'shaggy', 'SoCal', 'veneer', 'materialistic', 'success.In', 'turn', 'bit', 'ofAnnie', 'Hall-circa', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'character', 'biggest', 'arc', 'story', 'nurturing', 'self-reflective', 'one', 'minute', 'spontaneous', 'regretful', 'next', 'actress', 'often', 'home', 'period', 'roles', 'require', 'express', 'repression', 'feels', 'most', 'liberating', 'work', 'Joni', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'superb', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'redux', 'ofAlice', 'Wonderlandearlier', 'year', 'coltish', 'manner', 'young', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'lucidity', 'maturing', 'character', 'Growing', 'up', 'cherubic', 'inLittle', 'ManhattanandBridge', 'Terabithia', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'be', 'graduating', 'troubled', 'adolescent', 'roles', 'ease', 'Yaya', 'DaCosta', 'so', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'Paul', 'conveniently', 'bay', 'almost', 'overlook', 'serene', 'presence', 'scenes', 'Cholodenko', 'problem', 'filming', 'graphic', 'lovemaking', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'gratuitous', 'story', 'rare', 'when', 'film', 'be', 'funny', 'mature', 'involving', 'one']",N/A
1348410,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B003L20ICE,Elisabeth,"[0, 1]","**Review contains spoilers**I noticed many reviewers felt sorry for Paul in this movie, but I didn't.  In the beginning, though, I did.Paul graciously allows his donor kids to meet him and the son, Laser, acts snobbish towards him.  Laser had requested the meeting, yet comes unprepared, asking no questions, thus requiring Paul to carry the entire conversation.Later, Paul graciously allows the moms to meet him, too, and they're snobbish towards him as well.  Nic bluntly asks him question after question and when he answers honestly, she acts like he's not good enough to be in her presence.  Later, when alone with Jules, she even mocks him for being an alternative hippie.  Uhh...your wife's a hippie, too...and she named her son Laser.However, once the affair started, my sympathy for Paul disappeared.  He knew full well that Jules was married and didn't care.  To him, it was just a fun thing to do and didn't think twice how his behavior would affect Nic or the kids.  Therefore, both Nic and the kids had every right to be mad at him and banish him from their life.Paul was two-faced.  He acted like a buddy to Nic while simultaneously trying to poach Jules.  On the phone with Jules, he made it clear he wanted Jules to leave Nic for him.Nic was correct in calling him an interloper.  Not only did he meddle in their marriage, but he also meddled by telling Nic how to raise her daughter.  He knew full well that Nic opposed to her kids riding a motorcycle but did it anyway.  He definitely crossed a line there.The kids also had a right to be mad at Paul, too.  Like I said before, Paul was two-faced, so I didn't blame them for not trusting him.  A good example is towards the end, when Paul apologizes to Nic and gets the door slammed in his face.  He looks through the window at Laser and shakes his head as if to say, sheesh, your mom is really uptight - thus proving his apology was insincere.So, I don't pity Paul for getting banished or for being used.  No one deserves to be used, but since he used the black co-worker the same way, I didn't pity that he got a taste of his own medicine.He used the co-worker for sex just like Jules used him for sex.The co-worker got attached to Paul just like Paul got attached to Jules.When the relationship was no longer convenient for Paul, he let the co-worker go.  When the relationship was no longer convenient for Jules, she let Paul go.What I did agree with the other reviewers was that Paul shouldn't have received all the blame.  Jules spends a few nights on the couch, but other than that, one lackluster speech gets her off the hook.  Jules blames marriage being hard work and makes people feel distant and sometimes you hurt the ones you love.The reality is that it's not the marriage that created their distance but the couple being clearly mismatched.  These two had nothing in common and were BOTH critical of each other.As for hurting the ones you love, I wasn't convinced Jules loved Nic.The first time she had sex with Paul, she stops midway and Paul asks if that means she wants to stop.  She says No, what's bothering her is that the gardener is still outside.  So no concern over Nic's feeling or feeling overcome with love for Nic.  She just didn't want to get caught.So the real reason Jules cheats is not the reason she gives, but simply because she's self-absorbed.  Other proof of her self-absorption is when she acts offended that Nic is taking a call from a patient rather than tending to her bath.  Even worse was her firing the gardener for being an innocent bystander in all this.So overall, the adults in this movie were unlikeable and I'm not even sure what the point of the movie was.

1348413,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B003L20ICE,Enjolras,"[3, 5]","The Kids Are All Rightis a story of two kids raised by a lesbian couple who then contact their sperm donor - or dad. I wouldn't call this a romantic comedy - it's certainly doesn't utilize the many jokes that could apply to such a situation. Rather, it's more of a romantic drama. As the story progresses, each character finds gaping emotional voids in their lives. While at first the reunion seems to go smoothly, some people might be getting along a bit too well.The acting inThe Kids Are All Rightwas generally strong, but not as exceptional as some of the other reviewers claimed. While I understand Annette Bening and Julianne Moore are supposed to be great actresses, too often their performances came across as caricatures of a character. Bening's Nic was completely type A, controlling, and rude. You almost find yourself tempted to root against her as her life falls apart. Moore's Jules was the opposite, underachieving and flighty. Neither performance veered far from these stereotypes.Mark Ruffalo sometimes comes across as more stoned than charming, but fortunately it's just the kind of charming wistfulness called for in the role. His character probably grows the most throughout the film, and Ruffalo does a solid job portraying that growth without losing the essence of his character. Unfortunately, Josh Hutcherson was just there - his character didn't have a large role in the plot, and his performance didn't stick out.However, the real star of the movie was Mia Wasikowska as the daughter Joni. I wouldn't have imagined anybody so young could exert so much command over a performance, but she manages to portray a character both awkward and strong-willed. She also manages to come across as a teenager interested in sexuality, but without being a floozy. Joni's multifaceted, complex character is much more realistic than the one-dimensional Nic and Jules, and it is to her credit that Wasikowska pulls it off so well.I would have given this movie 4 stars if not for the gratuitous porno scenes and cursing. I'm not an overly sensitive type of socially conservative, but I just don't understand why Hollywood can't portray love and sex subtlety. And when I say porno, I mean pornography. The sex scenes really showed hardcore sex, breasts and all. And at several points the camera focuses on gay porno videos. I'm sorry, I for one don't like watching a movie with my family and then suddenly watching lesbian fellatio.

1348417,A15XNT79BMHKXN,B003L20ICE,"googleit ""movie buff""","[13, 13]","Yes, this movie is probably being at least a little overpraised by the critics.  I suspect many of them consider it ""brave"" for a film to depict an ordinary American family, whose parents just happen to be lesbians.  Let's face it, awards voters and critics love anything that deals with race, homosexuality, or any of the other hot-button social topics (witness the dreck known as ""Crash"" winning Best Picture a few years ago).None of which is meant to detract from The Kids are All Right, which is still quite an enjoyable small film.  The acting especially is uniformly good.  Annette Bening is sure to receive an Oscar nomination (well deserved), for her fantastic performance as Nic, the tightly-wound, more responsible half of the married couple formed by herself and Julianne Moore.  Moore is also excellent playing Jules, a more aimless free-spirit type - their differences are a source of much of the comedy in the film.  In all respects but their sexual orientation, they are a typical suburban married couple, with all the happiness and challenges that entails.Mark Ruffalo continues to be one of the most reliably good actors working today.  He gives another standout performance as Paul, the biological father of Nic's daughter Joni and Jules' son Laser.  As is often the case in his other films, Ruffalo's acting has such ease and charm that he makes his performance look deceptively easy.  In lesser hands the character of Paul could have been the stereotypical charming bad-boy we've seen before in movies a million times.  But Ruffalo gives him a warmth and humanity that makes the audience root for him (even when he screws up).My biggest complaint about the film was with a major plot twist involving Jules and Paul that seemed completely out of character to me.  I realize the director was trying to comment on how Paul's more accepting nature gave Jules something she was not getting from her wife Nic - but the way it was done in the film strained credibility.  I also thought the script was rather mean in its treatment of Paul in general... he was basically just discarded at the end of the film without even a chance at an apology.  Meanwhile, Jules makes a rather pat speech about marriage, all is forgiven, and we get a pat and not-very-satisfying ending.  The film seemed to border on being anti-male, at least that was my perception.A word about the 2 young actors who play the kids... they both give fantastic, natural performances and are clearly talents to keep watching for as their careers progress.Overall the great acting is what carries the rather slight story, and it is worth watching for Bening's performance alone (both she and Moore are completely believable as a lesbian couple, for what it's worth).  While I do not think it is Best Picture material, it is an enjoyable and occasionally moving portrayal of an almost-typical American family.",3,Entertaining but flawed indie comedy/drama (3 1/2 stars),1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,2885,"['Yes', 'movie', 'probably', 'being', 'least', 'little', 'overpraised', 'critics', 'suspect', 'many', 'consider', 'brave', 'film', 'depict', 'ordinary', 'American', 'family', 'parents', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'lesbians', 'Let', 'face', 'voters', 'critics', 'love', 'anything', 'race', 'homosexuality', 'other', 'hot-button', 'social', 'topics', 'dreck', 'known', 'Crash', 'winning', 'Best', 'Picture', 'few', 'years', 'ago', '.None', 'meant', 'detract', 'Kids', 'are', 'Right', 'still', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'small', 'film', 'acting', 'especially', 'uniformly', 'good', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'sure', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'well', 'deserved', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Nic', 'tightly-wound', 'more', 'responsible', 'half', 'married', 'couple', 'formed', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Moore', 'also', 'excellent', 'playing', 'Jules', 'more', 'aimless', 'free-spirit', 'type', 'differences', 'are', 'source', 'much', 'comedy', 'film', 'respects', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'are', 'typical', 'suburban', 'married', 'couple', 'happiness', 'entails.Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'reliably', 'good', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'standout', 'performance', 'Paul', 'biological', 'father', 'Nic', 'daughter', 'Joni', 'Jules', 'son', 'Laser', 'As', 'often', 'case', 'other', 'films', 'Ruffalo', 'acting', 'such', 'ease', 'charm', 'performance', 'look', 'deceptively', 'easy', 'lesser', 'hands', 'character', 'Paul', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stereotypical', 'charming', 'bad-boy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'million', 'times', 'Ruffalo', 'warmth', 'humanity', 'audience', 'root', 'even', 'when', 'up', '.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'film', 'was', 'major', 'plot', 'twist', 'involving', 'Jules', 'Paul', 'seemed', 'completely', 'character', 'realize', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'comment', 'how', 'Paul', 'more', 'accepting', 'nature', 'gave', 'Jules', 'something', 'was', 'not', 'getting', 'wife', 'Nic', 'way', 'was', 'done', 'film', 'strained', 'credibility', 'also', 'thought', 'script', 'was', 'rather', 'mean', 'treatment', 'Paul', 'general', 'was', 'basically', 'just', 'discarded', 'end', 'film', 'even', 'chance', 'apology', 'Meanwhile', 'Jules', 'rather', 'pat', 'speech', 'marriage', 'forgiven', 'get', 'pat', 'not-very-satisfying', 'ending', 'film', 'seemed', 'border', 'being', 'anti-male', 'least', 'was', 'perception.A', 'word', '2', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'kids', 'give', 'fantastic', 'natural', 'performances', 'are', 'clearly', 'talents', 'keep', 'watching', 'careers', 'progress.Overall', 'great', 'acting', 'what', 'rather', 'slight', 'story', 'worth', 'watching', 'Bening', 'performance', 'alone', 'Moore', 'are', 'completely', 'believable', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'what', 'worth', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Best', 'Picture', 'material', 'enjoyable', 'occasionally', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'almost-typical', 'American', 'family']",N/A
1348418,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003L20ICE,Grady Harp,"[13, 17]","Interesting to read all the reviews not only here on this space but in the media across the country raving about this film as being one of the best comedies of the year. After waiting until it came out on DVD, expecting something spectacular, this viewer found the film disappointing. Writer/Director Lisa Cholodenko and writer Stuart Blumberg did not use the book by the same name as their source for the story, but rather turned to Cholodenko's personal experience with the topic at hand and though it was many years in 'gestation', the movie was shot in an unprecedented 23 days. So much for background.Nic (Annette Bening) is a hard working obsessive compulsive physician partnered with Jules (Julianne Moore), a free-floating, indecisive, career-frustrated landscape designer. The have two children - Joni (Mia Wasikowska) birthed by Nic and Laser (John Hutchenson) birthed by Jules - by the same sperm donor, Paul (Mark Ruffalo). There are the usual family tensions but the quartet seems fine until Joni and Laser decide they want to know their father. They uncover Paul who is into organic food delivery service and relate to him and he to them. When Nic and Jules discover the mission their kids have been on they feel their family has been disrupted. Further developments occur that drive the wedge between the moms close to dissolution but of course that is overcome by the coming together of Joni's leaving for college.All this could be OK, but for this viewer the prejudices about same sex marriage are not championed but instead are placed in a negative light. Infidelity is just that and the problems don't stop there: offensive racial slurs occur when the embarrassed Jules fires gardener Luis (Joaqu&iacute;n Garrido) for no reason and Paul's idea of a family man excludes the possibility of marrying the very beautiful African American Tanya (Yaya DaCosta), etc. The crisis of the story should not be shared as it is the only quasi-surprise in the film - and even that seems like a put down to the position of women. Bening and Moore look old, tired and crotchety but give good performances to the characters as they are written. Ruffalo is being touted as an Oscar nominee for his role, but the role is a mirror of all his other work. If there are winners here they are Wasikowski and Hutchenson - fresh and credible.

I mean I liked all the characters in the film and continuity was super. Mark Ruffalo must be having a really good personal life or something because he has come a long way from the man standing in the shadows of a shot  -> to a man who can just about carry such a difficult role with such ease.It aches me to see that films like this don't get enough recognition when you compare their success with BLOCKBUSTERS. Anyway, the film has the kind of TITLE which would make me watch it anyway unless it was an animation, then I'd think twice.Mark Ruffalo gets my honors for playing the role of PAUL with remarkable ease and my heart warmed to his character very early in the film .Moving on, Annette Bening - well - where does one begin. She's definitely the star of the film besides the older of the two child actors.Julianne Moore has come along way but age has not taken away from just how contemporary and sexy her look is in some scenes of the film.This film is more than the storyline will throw at you. It talks about loneliness, togetherness, love, lust, sperm donation, questioning your kids sexuality and such random things in life without ever discerning the viewer.I also loved the character names of JONI and LAZER and not to forget JULES.Running with Scissors and The Upside of Anger are EXAMPLES of similar films that tried hard but failed to move me but THE KIDS ARE ALL ALRIGHT is where the FILM-DIRECTOR (if I can put them all in one bracket) gets it right.Anybody who misses the charm of films like LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. STEP MOM or let's say THE SQUID AND THE WHALE will not be disappointed by this film.This is the sort of film HBO will play for the next decade or two.PS - it was good to see an indian kid play a small/ half important role",5,A REMARKABLE ORIGINAL WELL MEANT FILM.,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,1863,"['begin', 'let', 'just', 'start', 'congratulating', 'director', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'cast', 'mean', 'liked', 'characters', 'film', 'continuity', 'was', 'super', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'must', 'be', 'having', 'really', 'good', 'personal', 'life', 'something', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'man', 'standing', 'shadows', 'shot', '>', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'just', 'about', 'carry', 'difficult', 'role', 'such', 'ease.It', 'aches', 'see', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'recognition', 'when', 'compare', 'success', 'BLOCKBUSTERS', 'Anyway', 'film', 'kind', 'TITLE', 'would', 'make', 'watch', 'anyway', 'was', 'animation', 'then', ""'d"", 'think', 'twice.Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'honors', 'playing', 'role', 'PAUL', 'remarkable', 'ease', 'heart', 'warmed', 'character', 'very', 'early', 'film', '.Moving', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'well', 'where', 'one', 'begin', 'definitely', 'star', 'film', 'older', 'two', 'child', 'actors.Julianne', 'Moore', 'come', 'way', 'age', 'not', 'taken', 'away', 'just', 'how', 'contemporary', 'look', 'scenes', 'film.This', 'film', 'more', 'storyline', 'will', 'throw', 'loneliness', 'togetherness', 'love', 'lust', 'sperm', 'donation', 'questioning', 'kids', 'sexuality', 'such', 'random', 'things', 'life', 'ever', 'discerning', 'viewer.I', 'also', 'loved', 'character', 'names', 'JONI', 'LAZER', 'not', 'forget', 'JULES.Running', 'Scissors', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'are', 'EXAMPLES', 'similar', 'films', 'tried', 'hard', 'failed', 'move', 'THE', 'KIDS', 'ARE', 'ALL', 'ALRIGHT', 'where', 'FILM-DIRECTOR', 'can', 'put', 'one', 'bracket', 'right.Anybody', 'who', 'charm', 'films', 'LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE', 'STEP', 'MOM', 'let', 'say', 'THE', 'SQUID', 'AND', 'THE', 'WHALE', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film.This', 'sort', 'film', 'HBO', 'will', 'play', 'next', 'decade', 'two.PS', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'indian', 'kid', 'play', 'small/', 'half', 'important', 'role']",N/A

I am one of the few people I know who did not appreciate two of the most famously-straight women in Hollywood playing gay mothers.  Annette Bening (dumbed-down wife of Warren Beatty) chewed the scenery so voraciously, I wanted to throw up.  I don't believe that an irritating character should also irritate the audience so drastically. She looked like she was sucking lemons the whole time.  I think that is what she believes lesbians are like. Why didn't the casting people get real lesbians to play the parts, like Kathy Bates and Jodi Foster, or Ellen DeGeneris and her real-life partner, Portia deRossi? The comment is made early in the film that the reason some lesbians like to watch male porn is that most lesbian porn is portrayed by straight women.  This film makes the same mistake.  I felt no credibility whatsoever in the gay-ness of Bening and Moore, though Moore was a bit more natural-seeming. And why was Mark Ruffalo shunned at the end by the whole family?  I thought he was the least neurotic, most normal person in the movie, and he had a great influence on the kids.  The whole affair thing was seemingly blamed on him and the kids were not encouraged to forgive and forget.  After all, he begged to be part of their lives because he really liked them.  Strange.  The whole thing was a squeamish bore and we almost walked out. I would like to see more films with real lesbians about real lesbian situations. ""Universal family"" my butt.  This was just the same-old Hollywood Real Family farce: conservative, pat, sticky, elitist, dull. P.S. See Tom Ford's ""A Single Man"" for authenticity about homosexual experience.

1348421,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,B003L20ICE,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[17, 20]","I found this movie to be very well-acted and well-directed.The sexual scenes didn't bother me not one bit, like some of the other reviewers.I mean, COME ON!!---This is life in the 21st Century!--Grow up already!People get naked and they interact, okay?---Thank goodness that computers and gadgetshaven't spoiled that for us (yet!), as it has with basic conversational skills and other formsof by-gone or slowly dying human interaction.I actually know both a lesbian couple, as well as a gay male couple whoare living similar circumstances as in the premise of this movie.I found it very modern, refreshing, and mature in it's approach to the subject matter.I have long been a fan of Mark Ruffalo, Julianne Moore and Annette Benning's work,and I also thought ""the kids"" themselves did an excellent job at portraying their roles.My problem was in that I felt like the Mark Ruffalo character kind of had his once happyand balanced, (for him), life just upheaved and torn apart when he gets contacted by these ""kids"",who of course, have every right to know who their father / donor was, and also what his background is.Ruffalo's character had a great attitude (I thought) about the whole thing...He was naturally pensive and cautious at first, though not in a malicious way, but soon warmed to theidea that he had these ""kids"" in his life now, and was more than open to getting to know them, and allowthem to get to know him. I felt that Annette Benning's character, who felt threatened, in addition to justbeing an anal-retentive, controlling witch with a capital B, was very mean and cold towards Ruffalo's character.Julianne Moore's character was a bit of a messy, confused, psychological user.Moore's character is that kind of person who is filled with inner turmoil or frustration, but makes it everybodyelse's problem around her. I hated how she treated the latino gardener too, just because she felt guiltyabout all of the drama and calamity that she was causing in her affair with Ruffalo's character!I always say: ""Don't jump in the river, if you're not a strong swimmer, babe!"" (-:Ruffalo's character was the perfect outlet for her pent up sexual confusion / tension,and the two (again) enter into a very complicated and torrid affair, which of course, couldonly end in heartache for all concerned.  As soon as Moore's character quenches her sexual thirst/curiosity,she just basically returns back to her life relationship Benning's character and the ""kids"",after she and Ruffalo's character are found out, and they all seem to throw Ruffalo's character under the bus...As if to say, ""Okay babe, we've all uprooted you from your life, and now we're done with ya!--So ummmm---kay, bye!""This kind of left a bad taste in my mouth, as Ruffalo's character is literally lefton the outside looking in, as Benning & Moore & the kids reunion-reconnection happens without him.He is locked out of their lives...Lives that he really never knew exsisted in the first place,until they invaded his, satiated their curiosity, and sent him packing.Not cool, I felt. )-:Not saying that Ruffalo's character was a saint or anything, but the man had his own businessand his own life...as unorthodox as it was...but then again, wasn't Benning, Moore and the kids' livesjust as unorthodox? I guess I just wished that a balance could've been reached between all parties,and it could've ended on that note, instead of Ruffalo's character, who btw, he played with a great spirit& optimism, being dejected and disregarded. Just my humble opinion of course.

1348425,A34M2BSL7CXEHT,B003L20ICE,"I. Sondel ""I. Sondel - lover of the arts""","[61, 73]","The Kids Are All Right is a thoroughly entertaining slice-of-life domestic drama about two kids who look up their sperm-donor father, causing cataclysmic changes in the family dynamic.  Not a unique premise save that the parents of the kids happen to be lesbians.The entire cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre for this film is to show straight America how ""normal"" gay families are and that they shouldn't be afraid of ""gay marriage"" or ""gay parenting,"" thus it doesn't delve too deep or wander too far off topic.  Political film making is a tricky business.  You'll remember the Tom Hanks drama Philadelphia was maligned by the LGBT activist fringe for all the issues it didn't address; to which my answer has always been: it's a two hour film, if you add too many spicy issues you're left with an unpalatable polemic.The script and direction by Lisa Cholodenko (High Art) are tight, well focused and only occasionally heavy-handed.  Her characters are fresh, while being stereotypically familiar to pre-conditioned movie-goers.  These are folks we know, people we work with and/or live in our neighborhood: ""normal"" people.  Is it perfect?  No; there an almost fatally flawed plot contrivance that seems only there to provide the filmmaker an all too easy source of conflict.What elevates the film above the run-of-mill movie-of-the-week domestic drama is the acting.  Annette Benning is staggeringly good as the head of her household - the alpha female in this case.  Her performance is embarrassingly rich; she presents a myriad of conflicting emotions, each one immediately recognizable, true and never over played.  Julianne Moore turns in a lovely portrait of the less-successful, less self-assured partner.

1348433,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,B003L20ICE,J. Michael Click,"[1, 2]","From my point of view, the most interesting thing about co-writer and director Lisa Cholodenko's film, ""The Kids Are All Right"", was not the movie itself, but instead, the commentary track that accompanied it on home video.  To be perfectly candid, I didn't quite ""get"" the movie when I finally watched it after months of reading press releases and interviews and critiques, and I was both disappointed and dismayed by my unexpectedly ambivalent reaction.  The insights shared in Cholodenko's commentary track helped me to pinpoint the sources of my reservations.In a nutshell, I discovered that the things I liked most about the film were generally the result of creative choices made by the people in front of the camera, rather than behind it.  Although none of the characters in the film are truly likable as written, the cast (Annette Bening and Mark Ruffalo in particular) manage to invest their performances with a certain measure of vulnerability and warmth.  Interestingly, Cholodenko credits these performers with bringing special contributions to the film that she had never considered or even imagined; thus it would seem that Bening and Ruffalo managed to rise above both Cholodenko's uneven script and her somewhat haphazard direction.  Julianne Moore, a supremely talented actress, was less successful at fleshing out her character than her co-stars, probably because her role - though pivotal - was less flexible.  Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson as the ""kids"" of the title, both turned in highly effective performances.In addition to the inadequacies in the script and direction, the film's cinematography was merely  serviceable, often too harshly bright in the outdoor sequences.  At times the editing often detracted from the story and settings, especially near the beginning of the film.  The film's soundtrack and score, also, seemed disjointed with one spectacular exception - the Joni Mitchell number that Annette Bening sang at Ruffalo's table was the perfect song for that crucial scene.Given the intriguing subject matter and the casting, ""The Kids Are All Right"" could - and should - have been an extraordinary, even groundbreaking, film.  Instead, it is merely a good one. That it fails to live up to its full potential is, in the final summation, a loss for the audience that has waited for just such a film to be produced.

Rooney,"[5, 8]","""The Kids Are All Right"" - it seems strange to label a movie with such an unconventional story line as formulaic, but upon reflection that is the way it seemed to me. The last minutes of the film are one long tear-jerker. The acting is uniformly excellent. Annette Bening and Julianne Moore are perfectly cast and superb in their roles. The son and daughter are fine as is Mark Ruffalo as the sperm donor who causes havoc for the family. Two lesbians, years ago, used a sperm donor to have children, and the kids were anxious to meet their ""father.""Bening is controlling and a perfectionist while Moore is more relaxed and free-wheeling, and Ruffalo is a self-absorbed free soul, actually a selfish lout.Some of the actions and some of the plot devices didn't ring true for me. Though I think the film tries very hard to be daring and overly explicit, I believe there is a lot to admire in it. I'm sure you'll be entertained by it as long as you aren't prudish and puritanical. The cinematography is almost too perfect in the crisp sunlit images it presents.The relationship between the two women I found very affecting. But I was annoyed that to me it seemed like a twenty-first century soap opera in the era of the unzippered lifestyle and the age of trying to shock the unshockable Molly Browns left out there. ""We'll go this far, and, you know what, we'll go just a little bit farther into shock and awe land,"" the moviemakers seem to be saying.Long ago movies breached my shock level, but I still have a discomfort zone, and that's the way I felt when the two women in bed were watching male gay porn. I don't have to know, and I don't want to know.

Menta, Jr.","[0, 0]","""The Kids Are All Right"" is an entertaining little story about the ups and downs of family life, with the only notable off-the-beaten-track aspect of the movie being that the two parents in the family are both women. The movie's one other somewhat unusual element is the eventual involvement of a third parental figure, the formerly anonymous sperm donor who enabled the two women to start a family years before. But even that wasn't too unusual, as additional parental figures are something that straight families also regularly encounter, in the form of ex-spouses and ex-significant others.There are many reasons to enjoy this smart, engaging movie, but I think it especially helps that the strongest political statement the film makes is not to make a political statement, at least not an overt one. If there's a gay cabal in the shadows trying to use the movie to promote a message, the message seems to be a pretty innocuous one, something along the lines of, ""Gay parents walk the same path as straight parents. Sometimes we make good decisions, sometimes we make stupid ones, sometimes we treat our partners well, sometimes we hurt them.""In any event, my wife and I both enjoyed this breezy little drama, which works especially well in the comfortable intimacy of your living room (or wherever you watch your movies at home). In fact, it wouldn't be bad if the movie's characters and scenarios were expanded into a television series... though of course you wouldn't get Annette Bening and Julianne Moore to reprise their roles.

1348438,AD9WTAOAFUZA4,B003L20ICE,"Jose R. Perez ""Jose""","[1, 2]","I wasn't sure what to expect from ""The Kids Are All Right"" other than sublime performances from three of my favorite actors today - Annette Bening, Julianne Moore and Mark Rufalo.  Whatever I was expecting did not compare to what the film delivered - in spades.  In short, TKAAR is a testament to the true - and new - meaning of family and a postcard of hope to the millions of non-traditional families who comprise our new reality.  I liken the film to 1980's Best Picture, Ordinary People, which captured effortlessly the family dynamic of the time with brutal honesty and raw emotion.  Watching ""Kids"" was partly a lesson in how far we've come as a society as well as how far we still need to travel to accept the fact that families come in new flavors (a same-sex couple here - deliciously played by Bening and Moore) as well as thru the miracle of science (a sperm donor, absent for a lifetime but suddenly available and real to his offspring).While the subject matter may be distasteful to some, what I found especially touching about the film's characters and themes was how incredibly NORMAL and REAL these people were.  The two moms (referenced repeatedly by the two teenagers in this quintet in the singular) are our neighbors, daughters, sisters, friends, and co-workers.  We ride the subway with them, share the car pools and accept - at least on a surface level - the reality of their choices, without judgment or fear.  Bening and Moore deliver stunning portrayals as the lesbian couple - they share a lived-in comfort and rapport that's familiar...like our own parents, and our own relationships - gay, straight or otherwise.  Their home is lived in and relaxed.  The battle the same demons most of us can relate to (that 3rd glass of wine some nights after crazy-busy days...or the longing a housewife feels for what she might have missed, the second-guessing of choices that are inevitable in any long term relationship.But for me, what brings the film together, in the end - and after much frustration as the story ebbs and flows - is Mark Buffalo as the long-forgotten - and rarely discussed man - who donated the fruit of his testes for money in college.  His life is upended as his connection with these two women and the children he spawned flows effortlessly, and his immediate sensual connection to Moore's character brings his new-found sensibilities to a bitter, life-altering crash.  Buffalo works wonders with a role that relies on his stiff-upper-lip attitude and facial emotions.  We see his evolution throughout the film, from when his stranger-children resurface and he's thrown unmercilesly under a microscope, finding himself unsure of who he is or why.  He's both at peace with his playboy life but also yearns to know all that he's missed, accept what's left to learn, and embrace all that he's yearned for but never understood.  As his world crashes around him and the ""moms'"" deal with real-life issues every couple can relate to - questions of character, morality, resentments and ""what might have been"" - the film transcends the formula and becomes an intense study in family.  The ties that bind are often fraught with doubt...and some are simply ripped away by complacency, resentment and the realities of what we give up to be who we ultimately become.The way Buffalo comes full circle here is a tour-de-force, his best effort yet.  Unassuming, yet so full of himself so as to risk everything to keep reality from intruding on his world.  Julianne Moore is radiant - as always.  I wish she were being submitted in the Supporting Actress category instead of Best Actress since she'd be a lock to finally win a well-deserved Oscar (she should have won for ""Far from Heaven"").But ultimately - ""Kids"" is a classic character study of the definition of family, of dads, sisters, brothers and moms.  Like Mary Tyler Moore's hateful mother-dearest in ""Ordinary People"" - Bening's no-holds-barred laser-focused and proud mom is one for the ages.  Here, she's gifted and sarcastic, staunch and direct, loving, grateful, pragmatic but very much in love.  Her interactions with her lover are casual, expected and tender - never exploitive to the viewer, but understood.  These women have the lived-in quality of most long term couples I know - straight and gay.  They're worn, but loving, celebrating and embracing the life they've created in the face of society's ongoing ignorance and distaste for gay families.  Bening KNOWS it's not an easy life choice, but her spirit and deep sincere love shines thru even when the sharp, cruel edges of her character startle us. She's the tough mom, the bread-maker, the one who went for the dream (at another's expense), and made a home with the woman of her dreams.  Bening is stunning - real, authentic and sympathetic - both in her spoken dialogue and in quiet unexpected shots of her amazing etch-a-sketch face which deliberately shows exactly what she's feeling, hearing, questioning, accepting, discovering and learning.  It's a wonderful face, and a terrifyingly familiar character to anyone in a long-term relationship who has ever wondered ""what if I wasn't with this person...who would I be?""  While Moore's character ultimately experiences this specific collision of fate and doubt on screen, it is Bening who ultimately conveys the layers and textures of a proud woman, torn by reconciling the illusion of love with the consequences of living the lives we choose.  Bening is over-due for Oscar love even though the competition this year will rival her two prior losses to Hilary Swank given the buzz for Natalie Portman in ""Black Swan"".  In my mind, Bening's singular performance in ""American Beauty"" already puts her among the top 1% of our best actors, while ""Bugsy"", ""Grifters"" and ""Running with Scissors"" remind us of her range - and the rage she taps into from the gut.  Only ""American Beauty"" comes close to her performance in ""The Kids Are Alright"" - and she deserves to be recognized and celebrated for her brilliant, no-holds-barred performance.""The Kids are Alright"" deserves to be widely seen by ANY couple in a long-term relationship, and especially career-couples with kids.  The themes here are universal, despite the somewhat rare and obscure circumstances of the plot.  It does help to remember that today, unconventional families -both traditional AND piecemeal - live on our block, or just down the street.  Our kids play with their kids; the adults engage - or not - just as we do...we share dentists, playgrounds and car pools.  And, in the end, even if we don't always see eye to eye (what neighbors do?) - we all want, crave and deserve the same thing ... to be happy, to have love, and to make a better future for our kids.  ""The Kids are Alright"" is accessible, yet distant and obscure, but ultimately illuminating, with career-defining roles from Annette Bening and Mark Ruffalo.  A rare, beautifully rendered film about family that shatters myths and inspires self-reflection.",5,"An ""Ordinary People"" for the 21st Century",1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,6986,"['was', ""n't"",

1348439,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003L20ICE,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 6]","The Kids Are All Right tells the story of a lesbian couple with two children that were conceived via anonymous sperm donor, but it succeeds by telling it in the same way it would if the couple had been heterosexual. Director/co-writer Lisa Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg make their lesbian couple no different from a typical married couple and largely avoid the clich&eacute;s that could cause this film to be labeled a ""gay movie.""Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) are a married couple living in California with their two children Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson). Nic is a doctor, while Jules is trying to establish herself as a landscape designer after several failed business ventures. Their marriage is a bit rocky, but they have two well-rounded, intelligent children conceived via anonymous sperm donor. Laser, at 15, has grown curious about his mystery father and asks his 18-year-old sister to find out who the man is. Leaving for college soon, she reluctantly agrees. The donor in question is Paul (Mark Ruffalo), unmarried, with no children, the owner of an organic restaurant, and naturally curious about these two kids. Joni and Laser find him cool and likable, but agree that their moms must not find out. When they do find out, they insist that Paul is invited over for dinner. Paul is so likable that only Nic remains skeptical of the man.The film is a comedy, but its humor stems from the characters' sense of humor rather than just exploiting the characters by putting them in humorous situations. The tone is kept light, never getting too heavy but Cholodenko knows not to let dramatic opportunities go to waste. With that said, the film never overdoes the emotional stuff. Where most movies allow an emotional holocaust to unfold whenever a character finds out something devastating, The Kids Are All Right has characters that react much like real people would which makes the emotional scenes very effective and very affecting.While I don't consider it a misstep per se, infidelity does factor into the plot. This is something we've seen countless times, but it's handled much better than it could've been here. While not always unpredictable and fresh, I found this film so charming, funny, and inspired I can forgive it for being occasionally overly familiar. What this film has is a good script with great characters enriched by how great they're played by the actors involved.Nic and Jules have been married for nearly twenty years, a marriage which Bening and Moore make believable. They're not a perfect couple, but they're not constantly at odds with each other either. They convey the believability of their relationship with body language and their general attitude towards each other; assisted by the great dialogue they're given. Both Moore and Bening are perfect and I'd be torn to choose who gives the better performance. They both avoid the stereotypes, never emphasizing how taboo their characters may seem to some, and they bring such humor and humanity to their roles while playing them as very normal people; two people who are married, have real emotions, and are struggling to do what's right while working through a rough patch in their relationship.Mark Ruffalo is almost exclusively responsible for the likability of Paul. The role seems simple enough, but it's easy to see where another actor could have brought the wrong nuance to the role and seemed immoral and somewhat immature rather than laid-back and comfortable with himself. His final scene in the film is remarkable; despite his mistakes, you can't help feel some empathy for him. Ruffalo brings out Paul's emotions in a way you really believe someone like Paul would and the way he smiles at Laser in the last moments of the scene brings a terrific amount of closure to his character. If Ruffalo and Bening are nominated for an Academy Award, this is the scene where Oscar voters would decide that. Ruffalo makes Paul one of the most likable characters of 2010 and gives the rare kind of performance that doesn't need to be explosively dramatic to get recognition during awards season.The Kids Are All Right is a funny, at times touching film driven by its exceptionable cast. With a lesser cast, I admit this may have been a lesser film but sometimes everything just aligns perfectly. This is one of my favorite films of 2010, with a cast doing some great work that I hope will be recognized. It's not a perfect film, but it does so many things right that other films of this kind get wrong.GRADE: A-",5,"A Good Script, With Some Great Characters Enriched by Great Performances",1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,4548,"['Kids', 'Are', 'All', 'Right', 'story', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'two', 'children', 'were', 'conceived', 'anonymous', 'sperm', 'donor', 'telling', 'same', 'way', 'would', 'couple', 'had', 'been', 'heterosexual', 'Director/co-writer', 'Lisa', 'Cholodenko', 'co-writer', 'Stuart', 'Blumberg', 'make', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'different', 'typical', 'married', 'couple', 'largely', 'avoid', 'clich', 'eacute', 'could', 'cause', 'film', 'be', 'labeled', 'gay', 'movie', 'Nic', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Jules', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'are', 'married', 'couple', 'living', 'California', 'two', 'children', 'Joni', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'Laser', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Nic', 'doctor', 'Jules', 'trying', 'establish', 'landscape', 'designer', 'several', 'failed', 'business', 'ventures', 'marriage', 'bit', 'rocky', 'have', 'two', 'well-rounded', 'intelligent', 'children', 'conceived', 'anonymous', 'sperm', 'donor', 'Laser', '15', 'grown', 'curious', 'mystery', 'father', '18-year-old', 'sister', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'man', 'Leaving', 'college', 'soon', 'reluctantly', 'donor', 'question', 'Paul', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'unmarried', 'children', 'owner', 'organic', 'restaurant', 'naturally', 'curious', 'two', 'kids', 'Joni', 'Laser', 'find', 'cool', 'likable', 'agree', 'moms', 'must', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'When', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'insist', 'Paul', 'invited', 'dinner', 'Paul', 'so', 'likable', 'only', 'Nic', 'skeptical', 'man.The', 'film', 'comedy', 'humor', 'characters', 'sense', 'humor', 'rather', 'just', 'exploiting', 'characters', 'putting', 'humorous', 'situations', 'tone', 'kept', 'light', 'never', 'getting', 'too', 'heavy', 'Cholodenko', 'not', 'let', 'dramatic', 'opportunities', 'go', 'waste', 'said', 'film', 'never', 'emotional', 'stuff', 'Where', 'most', 'movies', 'allow', 'emotional', 'holocaust', 'unfold', 'whenever', 'character', 'out', 'something', 'devastating', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Right', 'characters', 'react', 'much', 'real', 'people', 'would', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'very', 'effective', 'very', 'affecting.While', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'misstep', 'se', 'infidelity', 'factor', 'plot', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'handled', 'much', 'better', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'here', 'not', 'always', 'unpredictable', 'fresh', 'found', 'film', 'so', 'charming', 'funny', 'inspired', 'can', 'forgive', 'being', 'occasionally', 'overly', 'familiar', 'What', 'film', 'good', 'script', 'great', 'characters', 'enriched', 'how', 'great', ""'re"", 'played', 'actors', 'involved.Nic', 'Jules', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'marriage', 'Bening', 'Moore', 'make', 'believable', ""'re"", 'not', 'perfect', 'couple', ""'re"", 'not', 'constantly', 'odds', 'other', 'either', 'convey', 'believability', 'relationship', 'body', 'language', 'general', 'attitude', 'towards', 'other', 'assisted', 'great', 'dialogue', ""'re"", 'given', 'Moore', 'Bening', 'are', 'perfect', ""'d"", 'be', 'torn', 'choose', 'who', 'better', 'performance', 'avoid', 'stereotypes', 'never', 'emphasizing', 'how', 'taboo', 'characters', 'may', 'seem', 'bring', 'such', 'humor', 'humanity', 'roles', 'playing', 'very', 'normal', 'people', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'married', 'have', 'real', 'emotions', 'are', 'struggling', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'working', 'rough', 'patch', 'relationship.Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'responsible', 'likability', 'Paul', 'role', 'simple', 'enough', 'easy', 'see', 'where', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'wrong', 'nuance', 'role', 'seemed', 'immoral', 'somewhat', 'immature', 'rather', 'laid-back', 'comfortable', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'remarkable', 'mistakes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'empathy', 'Ruffalo', 'out', 'Paul', 'emotions', 'way', 'really', 'believe', 'someone', 'Paul', 'would', 'way', 'Laser', 'last', 'moments', 'scene', 'terrific', 'amount', 'closure', 'character', 'Ruffalo', 'Bening', 'are', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'scene', 'where', 'Oscar', 'voters', 'would', 'decide', 'Ruffalo', 'Paul', 'one', 'most', 'likable', 'characters', '2010', 'rare', 'kind', 'performance', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'explosively', 'dramatic', 'get', 'recognition', 'awards', 'season.The', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Right', 'funny', 'times', 'touching', 'film', 'driven', 'exceptionable', 'cast', 'lesser', 'cast', 'admit', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'lesser', 'film', 'sometimes', 'everything', 'just', 'aligns', 'perfectly', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2010', 'cast', 'doing', 'great', 'work', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'recognized', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'right', 'other', 'films', 'kind', 'get', 'wrong.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

1348442,A17DCPYMLXV1S4,B003L20ICE,Kay Shackleton,"[3, 6]","Hollywood has been all a buzz with ""The Kids Are All Right,"" a new film out by director Lisa Cholodenko. This is the first major Hollywood film about a fairly common family, with one exception. The parents are both women.""The Kids Are All Right,"" stars female heavyweight actors Julianne Moore and Annette Bening as lesbian parents of two children whom have come to be curious about their natural father (only known as a sperm donor). The insertion of this character, played by Mark Ruffalo, causes the balance of the family to go askew, and perhaps damages it beyond repair.But the story line is not what has all the movie reviewers worked up and excited. The performances so artfully crafted by Julianne Moore and Annette Bening are ones that will be studied by students of the craft. Lisa Cholodenko takes the characters and delicately peels away the layers of suburban convention and eco-pretentiousness to reveal the broken-hearted awareness of passion missing from a relationship. Moore and Bening are at their best, portraying long-loved partners that time, rearing children and careers have drained them of the love that once brought them together.Bening especially shines as a woman with heavy responsibilities and fears that her manicured family unit may be changed forever. In one scene Bening sings the words from Joni Mitchell's ""Blue"" and we see a middle-aged woman with a heart exposed and for just a moment completely relinquishing the walls the protected her so well before.Julianne Moore's performance is one more subtle and quiet. Yet, within this character that always put others before her own desires, it's apparent that a yearning to be seen and heard may break her away from a life that has been comfortable and easy.The children played by Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson are well casted and the supporting role by beautiful Yaya DaCosta adds necessary zest to the story.Obviously this film is not going to please many due to the lesbian story line, but in the end it is a film more about families and love than it is about sexual orientation.

1348443,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B003L20ICE,Kevin F. Tasker,"[1, 1]","Indie films tend to examine angst-ridden families more than any other genre. Famous examples include: The excellent ensemble piece The Royal Tennenbaums, the consistently morbidly amusing Igby Goes Down, the sleek, satirical Little Miss Sunshine, the shaky-cam shot, rather bland Rachel Getting Married etc. Indeed, it seems that family disfunction is a staple these days and with good reason, virtually  everyone can identify with oddball, quirky, sometimes ostentatious family members. The Kids Are All Right is an attempt to cash in on that particular facet of the canon, ultimately to pretty entertaining effect, even if it doesn't bring anything wholly original to the dining room table.The film provides us with a duo of lesbian protagonists, for that little extra sizzle. I found this a refreshing twist and Annette Benning and Julianne Moore give understated but realistic performances. Annette is a hard-nosed nurse who might be an alcoholic and Julianne is such an ex-hippie, free-spirit type it is slightly unbelievable the two fell in love in the first place. They raise two less-than-eclectic children, a very pale girl and a sports-oriented boy in a nice house in L.A. One day, the kids look up their sperm donor father, the always reliably and charismatic Mark Ruffalo, who enters their lives and brings all sorts of calamity down on an already shaky dynamic.There is sexual tension between Julianne and Mark's character that the movie explains with her need to find someone who was is more interested in her than consistently distant Annette. This doesn't seem to be enough to convince this movie-goer. Is she bi-sexual? Also, a sub-plot with an abusive relationship between the son and a friend arises and then disappears. Come to think of it, there is a rather unsatisfying plot-line with the daughter as well, as she tries to find the ability to make the first move with a lifelong guy friend at her slutty girlfriend's behest. Sound a little commonplace and familiar? It is.Essentially you will be watching the film to see what happens to the marriage between Julianne and Annette as they struggle to deal with ""interloper"" Mark's influence, as the kids' respective dramas leave something to be desired. There are plenty of scenes of adept dialogue. A conversation about the benefits of Acai stands out, for instance, as does a subplot dealing with organic gardening that launches Annette into a fun ""anti-healthy"" tirade that will leave those of us healthy eaters who aren't exactly composing fiends a little tickled. Though not as consistently self-aware as other films of its ilk, nor as original (or well-developed), The Kids Are All Right stands out because of its hearty performances, particularly the three adults. Mia Wakowski (sp) is okay as the daughter and the son is largely forgettable. Frankly, they are just not given enough to do.This is an easy-going, sex-filled tale of contemporary Californians doing their best to stay entertained and to love one another as life changes around them. It succeeds as such, but don't expect the sassy, artistic charm of The Tennenbaum clan or the moribund giggles of Igby's descent.",4,"Diverse, entertaining, if a little ""easy""",1293235200,"12 25, 2010",2010,3153,"['Indie', 'films', 'tend', 'examine', 'angst-ridden', 'families', 'more', 'other', 'genre', 'Famous', 'examples', 'include', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'Royal', 'Tennenbaums', 'consistently', 'morbidly', 'amusing', 'Igby', 'Goes', 'Down', 'sleek', 'satirical', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'shaky-cam', 'shot', 'rather', 'bland', 'Rachel', 'Getting', 'Married', 'etc', 'Indeed', 'family', 'disfunction', 'staple', 'days', 'good', 'reason', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'can', 'identify', 'oddball', 'quirky', 'sometimes', 'ostentatious', 'family', 'members', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Right', 'attempt', 'cash', 'particular', 'facet', 'canon', 'ultimately', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'effect', 'even', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'wholly', 'original', 'dining', 'room', 'table.The', 'film', 'duo', 'lesbian', 'protagonists', 'little', 'extra', 'sizzle', 'found', 'refreshing', 'twist', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'give', 'understated', 'realistic', 'performances', 'Annette', 'hard-nosed', 'nurse', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'alcoholic', 'Julianne', 'such', 'ex-hippie', 'free-spirit', 'type', 'slightly', 'unbelievable', 'two', 'fell', 'love', 'first', 'place', 'raise', 'two', 'less-than-eclectic', 'children', 'very', 'pale', 'girl', 'sports-oriented', 'boy', 'nice', 'house', 'L.A.', 'One', 'day', 'kids', 'look', 'up', 'sperm', 'father', 'always', 'reliably', 'charismatic', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'lives', 'sorts', 'calamity', 'down', 'already', 'shaky', 'dynamic.There', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Julianne', 'Mark', 'character', 'movie', 'need', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'consistently', 'distant', 'Annette', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'enough', 'convince', 'movie-goer', 'bi-sexual', 'Also', 'sub-plot', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'son', 'friend', 'then', 'disappears', 'Come', 'think', 'rather', 'unsatisfying', 'plot-line', 'daughter', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'ability', 'make', 'first', 'move', 'lifelong', 'guy', 'friend', 'slutty', 'girlfriend', 'behest', 'Sound', 'little', 'commonplace', 'familiar', 'is.Essentially', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'film', 'see', 'what', 'marriage', 'Julianne', 'Annette', 'struggle', 'deal', 'interloper', 'Mark', 'influence', 'kids', 'respective', 'dramas', 'leave', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'are', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'adept', 'dialogue', 'conversation', 'benefits', 'Acai', 'out', 'instance', 'subplot', 'dealing', 'organic', 'gardening', 'Annette', 'fun', 'anti-healthy', 'tirade', 'will', 'leave', 'healthy', 'eaters', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'composing', 'little', 'tickled', 'Though', 'not', 'as', 'consistently', 'self-aware', 'other', 'films', 'ilk', 'original', 'well-developed', 'Kids', 'Are', 'All', 'Right', 'out', 'hearty', 'performances', 'particularly', 'three', 'adults', 'Mia', 'Wakowski', 'sp', 'okay', 'daughter', 'son', 'largely', 'forgettable', 'Frankly', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'do.This', 'easy-going', 'sex-filled', 'tale', 'contemporary', 'Californians', 'doing', 'best', 'stay', 'entertained', 'love', 'one', 'life', 'changes', 'such', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'sassy', 'artistic', 'charm', 'Tennenbaum', 'clan', 'moribund', 'giggles', 'Igby', 'descent']",N/A

1348446,A1HHY7EFRT2KGQ,B003L20ICE,"klavierspiel ""klavierspiel""","[21, 27]","Lisa Cholodenko's new film tackles topics whose time has come. While the nation continues to roil with debate about gay marriage, countless same-sex couples have quietly entered into partnerships as durable as any heterosexual pairing, and many of these have produced children, either through adoption, or as in the case of Nic and Jules, the couple played by Annette Bening and Julianne Moore in ""The Kids Are All Right,"" artificial insemination, each having a baby by the same sperm donor (how common is this, I wonder?). Touching on another modern familial trend, their teenaged children Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson) have decided to seek out their biological father (Mark Ruffalo), who turns out to be Paul, an organic farmer and restaurateur whose casual attitude toward relationships is in sharp contrast to the committed family unit he has unknowingly aided in producing.Whatever his flaws, Paul nevertheless has something that has been lacking in their lives, and the children and Jules, the less driven of the two women, soon warm to him. The perfectionist, overachieving Nic hangs back warily, threatened by what she sees as the unthinking eagerness of her loved ones to steer into deep emotional waters. It is one of the outstanding virtues of Cholodenko's film that the twists and turns these five people's lives take after their initial contact seem, with one important exception, entirely natural and inevitable. Much credit has to go to the script by Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg, so adept at catching the nuances of family life and friendship, particularly the way the strains of everyday existence and the routine of years together can chip away at genuine love to the point of collapse before anyone knows what has happened. This truth is beautifully limned in a moving climactic speech by Moore.She is one of an altogether superb cast--Annette Bening's return to the screen is welcome and she plays Nic to absolute perfection (her silences are almost more eloquent than her words), while Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson are hardly less good as the children; Wasikowska in particular has a luminosity of a young Gwyneth Paltrow. That leaves Ruffalo, and though he has played the scruffy hunk role before, he does it very well, especially late in the film when he's conveying the bewilderment of a man who realizes, much too late, how far he is out of his depth.***SPOILER ALERT***So what's not to like? I suppose when it came to constructing the major plot crisis, it had to be the one Cholodenko and Blumberg chose. Only something that traumatic could have blown everyone's fragile happiness to smithereens, not to be put back together again except with agonizing care and no guarantee of success. Still, it's the one event that strikes a contrived note, and all the more disappointing because it plays into all of the sniggering stereotypes about a woman just needing the right man to show her the ropes. It seems churlish to complain  when so much is right about ""The Kids Are All Right,"" --but this flaw thereby seems the more glaring in comparison. Still, no one should be dissuaded from seeing this otherwise superb movie--there's too much great writing and acting in it, and food for thought long after it's over.",4,"I shouldn't be disappointed, but I am, just a little bit",1280016000,"07 25, 2010",2010,3273,"['Lisa', 'Cholodenko', 'new', 'film', 'tackles', 'topics', 'time', 'come', 'nation', 'roil', 'debate', 'gay', 'marriage', 'countless', 'same-sex', 'couples', 'have', 'quietly', 'entered', 'partnerships', 'as', 'durable', 'heterosexual', 'pairing', 'many', 'have', 'produced', 'children', 'adoption', 'case', 'Nic', 'Jules', 'couple', 'played', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Kids', 'Are', 'All', 'Right', 'artificial', 'insemination', 'having', 'baby', 'same', 'sperm', 'donor', 'how', 'common', 'wonder', 'Touching', 'modern', 'familial', 'trend', 'teenaged', 'children', 'Joni', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'Laser', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'have', 'decided', 'seek', 'out', 'biological', 'father', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Paul', 'organic', 'farmer', 'restaurateur', 'casual', 'attitude', 'relationships', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'committed', 'family', 'unit', 'unknowingly', 'aided', 'producing.Whatever', 'flaws', 'Paul', 'nevertheless', 'something', 'been', 'lacking', 'lives', 'children', 'Jules', 'less', 'driven', 'two', 'women', 'soon', 'warm', 'perfectionist', 'overachieving', 'Nic', 'hangs', 'back', 'warily', 'threatened', 'what', 'unthinking', 'eagerness', 'loved', 'ones', 'steer', 'deep', 'emotional', 'waters', 'one', 'outstanding', 'virtues', 'Cholodenko', 'film', 'twists', 'five', 'people', 'lives', 'take', 'initial', 'contact', 'seem', 'one', 'important', 'exception', 'entirely', 'natural', 'inevitable', 'Much', 'credit', 'go', 'script', 'Cholodenko', 'co-writer', 'Stuart', 'Blumberg', 'so', 'adept', 'catching', 'nuances', 'family', 'life', 'friendship', 'particularly', 'way', 'strains', 'everyday', 'existence', 'routine', 'years', 'together', 'can', 'chip', 'away', 'genuine', 'love', 'point', 'collapse', 'anyone', 'what', 'happened', 'truth', 'beautifully', 'limned', 'moving', 'climactic', 'speech', 'Moore.She', 'one', 'altogether', 'superb', 'cast', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'return', 'screen', 'welcome', 'Nic', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'silences', 'are', 'almost', 'more', 'eloquent', 'words', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'are', 'hardly', 'less', 'good', 'children', 'Wasikowska', 'particular', 'luminosity', 'young', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Ruffalo', 'played', 'scruffy', 'hunk', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'late', 'film', 'when', 'conveying', 'bewilderment', 'man', 'who', 'much', 'too', 'late', 'how', 'far', 'depth', '***SPOILER', 'ALERT***So', 'what', 'not', 'like', 'suppose', 'when', 'came', 'constructing', 'major', 'plot', 'crisis', 'had', 'be', 'one', 'Cholodenko', 'Blumberg', 'chose', 'Only', 'something', 'traumatic', 'could', 'have', 'blown', 'everyone', 'fragile', 'happiness', 'smithereens', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'agonizing', 'care', 'guarantee', 'success', 'Still', 'one', 'event', 'contrived', 'note', 'more', 'disappointing', 'sniggering', 'woman', 'just', 'needing', 'right', 'man', 'show', 'ropes', 'churlish', 'complain', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'right', 'Kids', 'Are', 'All', 'Right', 'flaw', 'thereby', 'more', 'glaring', 'comparison', 'Still', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'dissuaded', 'seeing', 'otherwise', 'superb', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'great', 'writing', 'acting', 'food', 'thought', 'long', 'over']",N/A
1348447,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B003L20ICE,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[28, 38]","This started out as a warm, funny film about an unconventional family. Annette Bening and Julianne Moore play Nic and Jules, the two Moms. They have raised a daughter, Joni (after Joni Mitchell) and a son, Laser (after the sailing dinghy?) whom they each conceived with sperm from the same donor, making the kids biological half-siblings.Joni is eighteen and college-bound. Laser is fifteen, and getting into trouble with his troubled friend Clay, who uses the word ""faggot"" too much, mildly physically abuses him, and knows no boundaries(in one scene he appropriates Nic and Jules' battery-operated boyfriend).Out of curiosity (and in Laser's case in need of an older male role model) the kids seek out their biological father Paul (Mark Ruffalo). The unattached Paul is a bit of a free spirit who owns an organic restaurant. Although he is at first bemused by the fact of having children, he is soon an enthusiastic participant in Laser's and Joni's lives.Nic reacts badly. She is the breadwinner, the disciplinarian, and a bit of a control freak who immediately objects to Paul. When nobody pays her any mind, she becomes ill-tempered and begins drinking heavily.Jules is the stay-at-home partner, more passive and more pliant. As Nic withdraws and becomes ever more disagreeable, Jules seduces Paul.For his part, Paul is thrilled to be part of the family, and begins to build castles in the air around his relationship with Jules and the children.Up until this point (about 5/6ths of the movie) this is a good-natured story of an atypical family facing a complex relationship issue. The last sixth of the movie melts down to slag, costing it at least three stars, because THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT suddenly transforms into a hideous anti-male, gay-bashing diatribe.The affair comes out. Although Jules instigated it and admits to doing so, Paul is utterly demonized. She is not. Jules breaks off the affair (""I'm gay. Damn you.""), and Nic calls him a ""F*****g interloper."" The kids (particularly Laser) reject him outright. ""I thought you'd be better,"" Joni sneers.It was at about this point that I seriously considered shattering this DVD with a hammer. The utter callousness and cruelty of Joni, Laser, Nic and Jules toward Paul is truly nauseating. Not one of these self-absorbed Hollywood standard-issue Yuppie characters ever considers for a single moment that it is THEY who have brought Paul into their lives. Neither Nic nor Jules has the depth or honesty to understand that they have both manipulated and used Paul to work out underlying and long-standing issues in their own relationship. The dour Laser, in rejecting this caring male figure, probably dooms himself to forming attachments with troublesome and abusive males like Clay who will dominate him for years to come. Joni escapes the nest. The ""happy ending"" of this vindictive film consists of Nic and Jules rebonding. Paul has vanished, broken.This film was obviously written by a male-bashing, self-hating woman who chooses to portray all lesbians as stereotypically dysfunctional man-haters and all men as garbage.The film's homophobia is manifest in that the women are controlling, manipulative, dishonest, insensitive and abusing without a scintilla of self-awareness.In retrospect, this movie's unbending hatred of men is evident at the outset (what parent names their son ""Laser""?). Male behavior is seen as destructive and irresponsible and weak (Paul, the ""sperm donor,"" has no family; Clay urinates on a dog's head at one point; Jules fires the gardener, the only eyewitness to her infidelity, for no real reason at all in some twisted act of expiation and he slinks off without a single word). In short, this ""warm family comedy-drama"" turns into a jeremiad against those of us who are so-called cursed with testosterone. Frankly, for me it's a blessing. I'd rather be Paul than be any of the four vicious losers in this film.This vile film was a big hit at Sundance, a Golden Globe winner, and an Academy Award nominee, I have to believe largely because of its oh-so Politically Correct portrayal of a married gay family. I will credit Bening, Moore Ruffalo and the kids with some splendid acting. Ruffalo in particular, deserves a combat medal for surviving this role psychologically intact. Obviously, the critics chose to overlook the unrelieved darkness and negativity that drips like poison from this film.Once again, cruelty passes for entertainment in the 2010s.

In the end I was left feeling like love would persevere for the two moms. Annette Bening and Julianne Moore are fantastic as Nic and Jules. They seem a bit mismatched and their differences cause a lot of friction throughout, I wondered at times how they had been together for so long when something like composting could set Nic off. But I guess it was meant to show how committed they were to being together and wanted to be stable for their kids, one borne by each of them via a sperm donor. When the oldest turns 18, the youngest talks her into tracking down the donor, splaying the story line down another arc of him and his baggage. The scene where Nic finds Jules' hair at Paul's place while they are having a family dinner...woooo, Annette Bening turns it on, I felt the temperature drop 15 degrees in there!

1348449,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B003L20ICE,K.T. May,"[2, 6]","""The Kids are All Right"" is a comedy-drama set in California which stars Julianne Moore as Jules and Annette Bening as Nic, two halves of a married lesbian couple who are raising two children, Laser (Josh Hutcherson) and Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and are doing it rather well, despite some setbacks.This film plays out like a hearty home-cooked meal of a film, like ""Life as a House"" or ""Parenthood"".  The only difference is that the central couple of the film is gay.  Art imitates life here, as this nuance makes no difference in how the children of this union are raised.  Laser and Joni are in the process of growing up to be stable, smart and well-adjusted adults.  We are given enough of a glimpse into the kids' romantic prospects to see that the sexuality of their parents does not impact their own, but we don't dwell on it.  The film does not make a big deal of it for the simple fact that it does not matter.We get a good sense of a down-home environment here, with the only difference being that the parents are both women.  Nic is of the fatherly type.  She is the stricter bread-winner of the family, while Jules is her compliment.  Jules is the softer side of the family, reigning Nic in when she becomes irrational.  Nic is the parent you would not want to meet at the front door at 2:00 in the morning if you blew your curfew.  Jules is the parent who would wipe your tears afterwards.In the typical curious fashion of young adults, Laser and Joni decide to contact their biological father, Paul, (Mark Ruffalo), the sperm donor by whom both Jules and Nic were impregnated to give birth to each of the couple's children.  Joni takes instantly to Paul, while Laser is apprehensive.  When the kids inform their parents that they have made contact Paul, they invite him over to get to know him a little better.The initial meeting is a bit awkward, but we get a bit of backstory on the cute way in which Jules and Nic met, which warms the heart just as any other romantic origin would.  Jules ends up accepting Paul's offer to landscape his backyard, which ends up turning the dynamic between Jules and Nic on its ear.Paul is a bohemian who grows his own vegetables and rides a motorcycle.  He participates in the kinds of activities that a teenager would think are cool and therefore ends up becoming, in contrast, ""the coolest parent"".  Through him, Joni begins to find her sense of independence, while Laser feels like he can't quite connect with Paul and instead spends most of his time with his loser friend, Clay, whose favorite pastimes include skateboarding off of roofs and peeing on dog's heads.Paul's interruption in this family's daily lives ends up challenging the strength of the family and the union between Jules and Nic.  The love between the two of them is palpable and it is rewarding to see everyone remain true to who they really are by the end of the film.  Paul ends up getting the short end of the stick, which seems rather unfair, but ultimately his existence here serves as a catalyst to help the family see the bigger picture and appreciate what they already have.""The Kids Are All Right"" is a film about a family like any other.  Upon completion, you will feel like you just finished a great book.  You'll want to recommend this film to anyone who possesses the close-minded view that gay parents cannot properly raise children.  And even though there will be no loose ends left untied, you'll still want more from this story.  This is such a fantastic film because it does such a good job of ignoring the assumed elephant in the room, because here it is proven that there isn't one.",5,"In the end, the kids are all right indeed.",1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,3620,"['Kids', 'are', 'Right', 'comedy-drama', 'set', 'California', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Jules', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Nic', 'two', 'halves', 'married', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'raising', 'two', 'children', 'Laser', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Joni', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'are', 'doing', 'rather', 'well', 'setbacks.This', 'film', 'out', 'hearty', 'home-cooked', 'meal', 'film', 'Life', 'House', 'Parenthood', 'only', 'difference', 'central', 'couple', 'film', 'gay', 'Art', 'life', 'here', 'nuance', 'difference', 'how', 'children', 'union', 'are', 'raised', 'Laser', 'Joni', 'are', 'process', 'growing', 'up', 'be', 'stable', 'smart', 'well-adjusted', 'adults', 'are', 'given', 'enough', 'glimpse', 'kids', 'romantic', 'prospects', 'see', 'sexuality', 'parents', 'not', 'impact', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'film', 'not', 'make', 'big', 'deal', 'simple', 'fact', 'not', 'matter.We', 'get', 'good', 'sense', 'down-home', 'environment', 'here', 'only', 'difference', 'being', 'parents', 'are', 'women', 'Nic', 'fatherly', 'type', 'stricter', 'bread-winner', 'family', 'Jules', 'compliment', 'Jules', 'softer', 'side', 'family', 'reigning', 'Nic', 'when', 'irrational', 'Nic', 'parent', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'meet', 'front', 'door', '2:00', 'morning', 'blew', 'curfew', 'Jules', 'parent', 'who', 'would', 'wipe', 'tears', 'afterwards.In', 'typical', 'curious', 'fashion', 'young', 'adults', 'Laser', 'Joni', 'decide', 'contact', 'biological', 'father', 'Paul', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'sperm', 'donor', 'whom', 'Jules', 'Nic', 'were', 'impregnated', 'give', 'birth', 'couple', 'children', 'Joni', 'instantly', 'Paul', 'Laser', 'apprehensive', 'When', 'kids', 'inform', 'parents', 'have', 'made', 'contact', 'Paul', 'invite', 'get', 'know', 'little', 'better.The', 'initial', 'meeting', 'bit', 'awkward', 'get', 'bit', 'backstory', 'cute', 'way', 'Jules', 'Nic', 'met', 'heart', 'just', 'other', 'romantic', 'origin', 'would', 'Jules', 'up', 'accepting', 'Paul', 'offer', 'landscape', 'backyard', 'up', 'turning', 'dynamic', 'Jules', 'Nic', 'ear.Paul', 'bohemian', 'who', 'own', 'vegetables', 'motorcycle', 'kinds', 'activities', 'teenager', 'would', 'think', 'are', 'cool', 'therefore', 'up', 'becoming', 'contrast', 'coolest', 'parent', 'Joni', 'find', 'sense', 'independence', 'Laser', 'feels', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'connect', 'Paul', 'instead', 'most', 'time', 'loser', 'friend', 'Clay', 'favorite', 'pastimes', 'include', 'skateboarding', 'roofs', 'peeing', 'dog', 'heads.Paul', 'interruption', 'family', 'daily', 'lives', 'up', 'challenging', 'strength', 'family', 'union', 'Jules', 'Nic', 'love', 'two', 'palpable', 'rewarding', 'see', 'everyone', 'remain', 'true', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'end', 'film', 'Paul', 'up', 'getting', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'rather', 'unfair', 'ultimately', 'existence', 'here', 'catalyst', 'help', 'family', 'see', 'bigger', 'picture', 'appreciate', 'what', 'already', 'have', 'Kids', 'Are', 'All', 'Right', 'film', 'family', 'other', 'completion', 'will', 'feel', 'just', 'finished', 'great', 'book', ""'ll"", 'want', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'close-minded', 'view', 'gay', 'parents', 'can', 'not', 'properly', 'raise', 'children', 'even', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'loose', 'ends', 'left', 'untied', ""'ll"", 'still', 'want', 'more', 'story', 'such', 'fantastic', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'ignoring', 'assumed', 'elephant', 'room', 'here', 'proven', ""n't"", 'one']",N/A

Recently I saw ""The Kids Are All Right,"" starring Julianne Moore and Annette Bening.I was actually surprised when the movie came to my neighborhood mall, much less my city.  Here in the Central Valley, we are often left out of the mix when it comes to quirky movies (or anything even remotely unconventional).I had expected to enjoy it, but didn't have my hopes up too high, as sometimes I am disappointed. So imagine my relief to find that, not only did it surpass my expectations, but I was so into it that I wasn't bored for even a moment.  Sometimes movies that are about particular themes or topics will be predictable.  But not this one.  Even though there was the inevitable adolescent angst, followed by the search for the absent father, this one had the unique twist of a family headed by two ""moms,"" who had used a sperm donor.In fact, each mom had one of the kids and they both used the same donor.  Makes the search easier.Mark Ruffalo starred as the ""sperm donor,"" who incidentally was quite interested in forming a bond with the kids.The kids invite him to their house with the moms and they all start to form a friendship of sorts.  Jules, the character played by Julianne Moore, has just started a landscape business, and  Paul (dad) conveniently hires her to landscape his yard.Okay, I saw the next bit coming...sort of.  But I won't describe what happens.Suffice it to say that a lot of chaos ensues.Throughout the movie, I most enjoyed the interactions between the family members and absolutely loved seeing the homey backdrop to the family moments.

1348452,AKR6UK8O6DM6X,B003L20ICE,"Lemas Mitchell ""Libertarian/ Empiricist""","[7, 17]","Short Attention Span Summary (warning, plot spoilers!):1. We have a lesbian couple that are some years into a marriage and are raising two children together and have the boring sex life of married couples. (It's not established who was who's child).2. When one of the children is 18 years old, she decides to look up the sperm donor.3. We meet the sperm donor, and see that he is a guy who has no problem getting women (he has a HOT girlfriend who is about 20 years younger than he is).4. Through a series of blurry steps, the sperm donor ends up in bed with the younger of the two women. They spend a lot of time acting like two little bunny rabbits (Neither of the women was identified as bisexual, nor was the issue solved.)5. The older woman finds the hair of her wife in the bathroom of the sperm donor and surmises that they are having an affair.6. At some point, the sperm donor (Paul was his name, I believe) decides that he wants a family and that he should latch onto this one. (This is in spite of having a much younger, much hotter girlfriend with whom he would have a lot more fun starting a family.)7. The remainder (about 20 minutes) is taken up with the resolution of SOME of the conflicts in the film. Ultimately the older partner tells Paul that he needs to find his own family and that he is just an interloper. We don't hear anything from him again.Lots of weird things in this film.1. Julianne Moore is not the best looking woman. It is really hard to believe that this guy (who was shown to be so attractive to women) would pass over so many other younger, fertile women to chase after a woman that was nearly on the wrong side of menopause to try to expropriate some children that were not his. I am not sure if this was poor writing (the implausibility of the situation as it came across on the screen) or just poor casting (i.e, I might have found the relationship more plausible if Paul's love interest was not played by the hideously unattractive Julianne Moore).2. Lots of things just came out of nowhere. The daughter turned into an angry/ rebellious teen about halfway through the movie. Huh?3. Too many things were left unresolved. Was the younger wife a closet bisexual? What was wrong in the marriage of the two women that made it such that one of partners had to go outside of the marriage? What happened with the friend of the son (Laser) who obviously had some mental problems? Weren't we shown enough weird things to be led to believe that this boy's obvious mental illness would lead to some event that would support the thin plot.4. Political agenda overkill. Ok, so all the people who were heterosexual in the film had something wrong with them. First scene in the movie, the young kid who has been snorting dope in his father's house gets wrestled to the ground by his father and told to take it somewhere else. This is in contrast to the Perfect Lesbian Household. Then, the illicit relationship has to be between a man and a woman, but the traditional and morally proper (=in the context of the stable house) has to be between two lesbians. Then, when a character expresses interest in someone of the opposite sex, she has to be a nyphomaniac/ slut. When the daughter is emotionally damaged by her mother's affair, she goes after a man *Yawn*. *(We got the point. Straight=bad. Gay=good.)5. Lots of pointless, raunchy sex scenes. Not quite sure what they were supposed to be establishing.Save your money.",2,"Um, what was this?

1348453,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B003L20ICE,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[2, 4]","I loved this movie, and after reading some of the negative reviews, think a lot of people got hung up by watching it as a social commentary. With gay marriage such a hot political topic right now, I guess it's hard not to do that, but I really think it wasn't written to be that way. It's not a soapbox movie. IMHO it's not trying to portray lesbian marriage any certain way, or lesbians themselves, or teenagers, or sperm donors etc. It's about 5 people. 5 individuals, with very distinct personalities, psychological baggage, desires and fears. Two happen to be gay, two happen to be teenagers, and one happens to be a straight male who's never married and once was a sperm donor.If anything, this film is about marriage and family apart from any of the individuals involved. Or rather, it's about the struggles most of us go through trying to make these things work. The unique back-stories and social milieu are part of the struggle for these particular individuals, but not the point of the story. So I don't think it's fair to judge whether these were 'real lesbians' (who gets to decide what that is anyway?) or 'real teenagers', or whether this presented gay marriage in a positive or negative light.I think the main reason I loved this movie though is that personally I was just carried along by the characters every step of the way. I believed every single one of them. I thought these 5 individuals put in fabulous performances, and that Annette Benning's was Oscar material. I also laughed out loud at points, so that's great, too.

Similarly the actors that take the material and make it their own breathe a unique life into this film.

Lastly would be directing and production.

A couple who've been together for a long time, whose elder child is about to leave for college, have their relationship threatened by an affair. If the couple did not happen to be lesbians, I doubt it would have generated that much buzz. Still, what the film does, it does quite well.First, the acting is very strong. Annette Bening, playing the uptight control freak breadwinner half of the couple, Nic, does a great job; she earns her Oscar nomination. She shows the strain of keeping (or trying to keep) her more free-spirited partner Jules and their two kids, Joni and Laser, on track. She pays the bills for their comfortable upper middle-class lifestyle, superintends the submission of college applications and the writing of thank-you notes, and otherwise bears all the weight of responsibility in the family. ""If it were up to you, our kids wouldn't even write thank you notes,"" is a typical line she throws at her partner Jules. Nic does not react well to the intrusion into her domestic cocoon that takes place when her kids contact their sperm donor and gradually introduce him into their family dynamic. Marc Ruffalo as the charming sperm donor, still single and playing the field 20 years later and engaging with the kids more as a cool older friend than a parent, Julianne Moore as Jules, and the actors who play the two teens are all very convincing in their roles.Second, the depiction of the drifting apart that leads to Jules's affair is pretty honest. It's not that Jules doesn't love Nic any more; it's just that after 20 years, things have gotten a bit stale and the couple's roles entrenched. Jules, a gentle, slightly fuzzy-around-the-edges soul who has been the stay-at-home mom and has never really settled into a career, feels unappreciated by the hyper-competent, bossy, intense Nic. When Jules finds someone who makes her feel passionate and desirable the way she is, she acts on it.Third, the movie handles quite convincingly the awkwardness and push for independence that arrives as Nic and Jules's two teenagers come of age. They seem like real teenagers; basically decent but not overly perfect, intelligent, presentable but not over-pretty.It's a rare movie that consists mostly of a series of uncomfortable encounters that feels truthful but does not make you feel so squirmy you want to run out of the room. The dialogue soundes like real people talking, and the actors play their nervousness with total conviction but without seeming fake or mannered.The movie effectively if somewhat obviously sends up middle-class manners and expectations, with its visual and verbal humor about Volvos, high-octane parenting, varietal grapes, Pottery Barn-inspired decor, and organic local cuisine.There's nothing earth-shaking here, but ""The Kids Are All Right"" is an enjoyable, well-made comedy.

1348464,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B003L20ICE,M. Bullions,"[1, 2]","In recent cinema, actors have failed to bring me to a sense where I genuinely cared about their characters. Even when they do a technically good acting job, they don't leave a sense of emotion, beauty, and enlightenment with you. They don't stay with you for long. They don't give you a reason, or a desire to return to the cinema and see their film again.In The Kids Are All Right, Lisa Cholodenko paints a canvas of thoughtful characters, an insightful script, a beautiful Californian setting, and even though it's no special-effects laden, CGI-heavy typical summer entertainment, it brings you more than any film you've seen over the summer. It has fantastic acting from its adult and younger actors alike. As of the very moment, I have seen this film twice. And both times, I laughed my ass off, I cried, I felt the emotion of the characters, and I left the cinema with a true sense of enlightenment and optimism.The film follows a married lesbian couple, Nic and Jules (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore) who have been together for many years. Their children, Joni and Lazer (Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson) are very happy, except they've always wondered about their biological father. They find their sperm donor, or father in Mark Ruffalo's Paul. Ruffalo seems somewhat typecast in the ""idiot"" parts, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, considering how well he plays it. The characters become bigger parts of each other's lives and butt heads, and without saying any more, people love, people hate, and they make mistakes.Julianne Moore has certainly been on the top of her game in her recent work. With the few scenes she had in last winter's A Single Man, alongside powerhouse Colin Firth, and this spring's Chloe, alongside the surprising powerhouse Amanda Seyfried, and in this spring's season of Tina Fey's 30 Rock, great, even with a ridiculous Boston accent, she's been in top form. And Annette Bening, who I haven't seen for a while, also is fantastic in this film. You can believe that the two are a couple who have made it through the thick and the thin. The two ladies compliment each other very well.However, the real heart of this film lies in Mia Wasikowska, who plays Joni, the older daughter. Her face really tells the story of the film. She says so much, without really saying anything at all. The recent Tim Burton remake of Alice In Wonderland being the only thing I remember seeing her in, I can tell you that she flexes her acting muscle more here. A scene near the film's end where her character leaves for college, you can see the emotion flooding her face, and it's a beautiful thing. Considering I'm a student who's about to leave for college in less than a month, perhaps I got more out of it than the average person would.

Nic (Annette Bening) and longtime partner Jules (Julianne Moore) live an upper-middle class lifestyle in suburban California with their teenaged children Joni (Mia Waskikowski) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson), whose biological father was the same anonymous sperm donor. Nic is a controlling, uptight obstetrician and the family's breadwinner, while Jules is a bohemian type who has just started a landscaping business. The children take steps to find their biological father Paul (Mark Ruffalo) without their parents' knowledge, and, when the moms meet him, Paul's presence complicates their relationship considerably.It strikes me that if this storyline were applied to a heterosexual family, it would be banal. I'm not sure it's interesting here either, frankly. The relationship the women have with their children seems overdramatic and contrived. Paul is obviously thrown in there to be a catalyst for family tensions. The cast is pretty good, though. In hands less skilled than Annette Bening's, Nic would simply be a domineering neurotic. Mark Ruffalo deserves a lot of credit for playing a guy whom the audience doesn't know whether to like or hate, a nice guy who does hurtful things. But the children are a little underwritten, and Joni doesn't act her age. I really don't think much of the script. It begins with a comedic bent and ends up maudlin and trite.

The weak is shackled by guilt and debt. The dominant fears the breeze of fresh air.

Meanwhile, their son Laser (Josh Hutcherson) contacts his biological father, the free spirited Paul (Mark Ruffalo) who donated sperm when he was a young man. As Paul is increasingly intertwined in his ""children's"" lives, his role in the family becomes more complex.There are no villains here. Nic's controlling nature is somewhat overemphasized, but Bening remains sympathetic and humorous. Moore is likewise engaging as the appealing but insecure Jules. Ruffalo is excellent as the laid back Paul. His unexpected reactions to having a family of sorts are fascinating but a tad underdeveloped.Joni and Laser are perhaps the most well drawn characters. In fact, their stories could have been explored more. The siblings have a close but imperfect connection. They are sarcastic, naive, endearing, and a refreshing departure from unrealistic teenage stereotypes.The Kids Are All Right touches on everyday questions of patience, disappointment, and love.

(So thoughtful.) Then the family unit treks off to take daughter to college.  Ah, new beginnings.  Heavy-handed symbolism (Ruffalo's plaintive staring at his son through the window), gender reversal (gay male porn to stimulate female sex drive), and new age California stereotypes are also problematic. How are these two women even likable?  Consider the scene in which guilt-ridden Moore fires her Mexican laborer because she's an adulterer.  Or the moment when Bening yells at Ruffalo and daughter because Bening is projecting her paranoia on the two when seeing them on a motorcycle.

The other one showing evidence of drifting through life, trying various careers, never really sticking with one.

There were a few bits that did, however.Great acting by Mark Ruffalo and Mia Wasikowski.  Actually liked how Ruffalo's character was developed, and how he went from being a bit of a man whore, to really loving the family dynamic, perhaps more than he should.Not much character development throughout.  Not a ton of plot development.Slacker son realized that his one friend's an ass.That's the sum of his growth.The daughter's too shy to put moves on the boy she's always hanging out with.  Until she gets drunk at a party and kisses him a couple of times.  But then runs off, perhaps disgusted with herself, it's not made clear.She... well at least she leaves for college.The relationship between the two women does an occasionally-decent job of showing long standing hostilities that are kept under the surface, and what happens when they surface.Fairly realistic for an old married couple.Bening's character seems to have it all together, until the sperm donor starts being part of the life, then she flips out.

Yes, families face many things, but foul-mouthed, somewhat insecure women changing their preference (temporarily) as well as easily chucking (or changing) relationships when a man enters the picture seemed rather inappropriate as well as somewhat silly.While new ground may have been broken in some ways, and the story did try to offer a glimpse into an established women-centered family, something that we rarely see in movies or television, this portrayal left me feeling that I didn't want to see this movie or revisit these characters again.

I was once a total homophobic many years ago, and I still simply can't understand why people end up being gay, but films such as this one, Philadelphia, Milk, and Brokeback Mountain have helped me understand what drives the feelings gay people have. And over the years I have become a much more open minded person. I have dozens of gay friends, and I admit that sometimes I still don't understand the entire gay reality, but one thing is for sure, I have learned that when two gay people love one another it is just as real and powerful as it would be between two heterosexuals who fall in love. This film examines what life is really like for a lesbian couple and the everyday problems they might have to endure. The acting in this film was simply incredible. Over the past three years I have become a huge huge huge fan of Mark Ruffallo. I fell in love with this guy after seeing him in an astounding performance in Zodiac. And after learning that he nearly died of a brain tumor and then survived unspeakable torment and then regained an even grander acting career, I discovered that here is a man who is truly an amazing human being. One of incredible determination and courage. He is now my most favorite actor.

But the film's cast of notable and critically acclaimed actors, Annette Bening (Nic), Julianne Moore (Jules), Mark Ruffalo (Paul), and the dynamic chemistry that each display as well as the film's screenplay convincingly and successfully show the irony, humor, and emotion of each of the characters.  Despite the well-known names of the film, it is the enticing subject matter that may draw the viewer.The premise of the film involves a unique family with Bening and Moore playing the parents to two teenagers Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson).  The family appears to experience the average ups and downs of raising two teenagers on the brink of adulthood.  But things begin to go astray when Joni happens to come across old paperwork pertaining to a sperm donor; after finding the information, decides to seek sperm donor, Paul.  And while Joni and Laser attempt to acquaint themselves with Paul, Nic and Jules had already been experiencing a bit of distance and lack of intimacy, and as Paul enters the picture, things become complicated between the two as well as the entire family; what appeared to be productive familial relationship blossoming with a new member of the family, the event only causes friction.The Kids Are All Right was deserving of Academy Award nominations because of all aspects of the film from the characters to the complex storyline.  The film has a variety of moments that viewers will find thought provoking and surprising, especially with the issues that are depicted within particular scenes that involve sexuality, indiscretions, and perceptions.

1348492,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B003L20ICE,RMurray847,"[3, 6]","THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT has been heaped with praise from critics, including significant talk of Oscar nominations.  The entire time I was watching the film, I couldn't help but wonder if at least some of that stemmed purely from a need to praise a film for showing a ""normal"" lesbian family...regardless of the quality of the film.  I know viewers (or even just people who read a description of the film) who have problems with gay issues will no doubt bristle at this film and its efforts to ""push an agenda.""  It would be nice if a movie could just be judged for its own merits, apart from political/social concerns...but I suppose that isn't possible.However, I'd like to try.  Because the nice thing about the film is that it DOESN'T really push an agenda.  It's just a quirky, indie-spirited film with above average performances and script...full of frustrating characters who do lovely things and stupid things, just like real life.It tells the story of a long-term lesbian couple (Annette Bening, playing a doctor & Julianne Moore, playing the mom who has trouble settling on anything to do, but is currently trying on a ""landscaping designer"" hat), who have two teenage kids, Mia Wasikowska, just turned 18 and Josh Hutcherson, around 16.  Wasikowska is studious and sincere...darn near what anyone would call the perfect daughter.  Hutcherson is more of an athlete and goof-off.  He's very nice, but is easily swayed into engaging in inappropriate behavior.  Early on, the film implies that he's curious to know what it would be like to have had a father-figure in his life...so he persuades his sister to contact the man who donated the sperm that resulted in him and his sibling.  (By the way, one thing the film doesn't get right...the two siblings get along famously and never seem to get on each other's nerves.  Sure.)  So she calls ""dad"" (Mark Ruffalo, a restauranteur who also owns an organic farm  co-op, drives a BMW motorcycle and is the most laid-back, cuddly, sincere guy around), and the three meet.  The meeting goes well, and eventually, to the shock of the two moms, the family of 4 now seems to have a fifth person.  While Ruffalo isn't exactly a part of the family, his relationship blossoms with the kids and with Moore (who gets a job redoing his landscaping).Bening gives the most nuanced performance here.  She's the least easy character to like.  She's always been the major bread-winner.  She's a doctor, so she is naturally a bit of a perfectionist.  She tries SO hard to be even-handed and fair, but she's actually a tightly-wound bundle of nerves who would clearly be happier just telling everyone else what do, when to do it, and what to say.  She no doubt imagines herself as a ""hip & cool"" parent, but she's actually super uptight.  But underneath it all, we see the deep, abiding love she has for everyone in her family.  She CAN be warm and open...but she can be really nasty too, especially when she drinks, which she does too much of.  Her character goes through a number of subtle changes throughout the film, and later, when she is wounded...it is her pain that we feel most acutely...even though she is the character we've felt most distant from.Moore plays a woman who was clearly a bit more of a free spirit in her youth, and that has translated into her feeling a bit adrift in middle age.  She's tried several careers, unsuccessfully...and clearly feels some guilt at having not contributed as much financially to the family, yet she also resents being made to feel guilty and foolish.  She is more open to Ruffalo's charms, and this causes significant friction.Ruffalo does his best Mark Ruffalo-like performance.  He's a ladies' man who doesn't have to try.  He plucks organic tomatoes, he runs a funky restaurant, he drives a truck and wears leather, yet is gentle and passionate at the same time.  You can see how women might struggle to resist him...but you have to wonder if someone like him really exists.  His best scenes are when he spends some time with his son...you seem him struggling between just being a pal (the easy choice) and being something of a role model (the tricky choice).  He enjoys time with his daughter, but she's so together that it's easy for him...it is the son looking for a father-figure that draws out deeper feelings in Ruffalo.  He's forced to examine the path his life has taken thus far.There are many bumpy spots along the road, and naturally many old feelings are aired, wonderful verbal fights are fought and tears are shed in abundance.  In the end, what makes the film a cut above the average is the fact that each character is sharply drawn, each has admirable character traits and deep flaws.  The actors do a good job, but they also have a good script to rip into.I've only known a small handful of long-term lesbian couples, and certainly I know nothing about the intimate details of their private lives.  Thus, I can't comment on the credibility of the lesbian relationship depicted in THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT.  But the details of Bening & Moore's love life are fairly specific, and it all FEELS credible.  I'll leave it to others who know better to say if it really IS credible.  But Bening & Moore have good chemistry, and that certainly helps.This isn't the greatest film ever (or even the best of the year so far).  It didn't take me through a wrenching emotional journey (as it clearly wanted to).  But it DID take some unexpected turns, featured great writing and good performances...and for that alone, I can strongly recommend THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT.",4,Very nice script and very nice

It just happens that the parents are lesbians, both having accepted seed from the same donor.  First the son, then the older daughter, decide to meet him without telling their moms.  The donor dad, of course, throws a delicate system badly out of balance and conflict ensues.That is the plot.  The people underneath are acted with a delicate intensity that is so good it approaches real life, as only the best art can accomplish.  While very funny, this is not a comedy but a serious drama that I found  moving and thought provoking.  Allowing herself to appear splendidly middle-aged, Benning plays a tightly wound doctor, the breadwinner and maintainer of order.  Moore is the designated full-time mother, who is less together and feeling neglected by her spouse.  Their children are also realistic:  the elder daughter is responsible and brilliant, the younger son rebellious and a bit of a laggard who hangs out with the wrong crowd.  The donor father, Russo, is kind of a sensualist rogue, never settling down and entering mid life as a successful restauranteur.Without revealing the spoiler details, once Russo throws a spanner into the works, all the relationships are thrown into question.  Benning is threatened, but she plays it very down-stated, with faux pas and overly strenuous attempts to ingratiate herself.  Moore acts out, with devastating consequences.  The kids move from admiring Russo to shocked disappointment.  It leads to one of those great resolutions that is as unsatisfactory as it is realistic when it comes to long marriages.If the film has a point, it is that this is a family like any other, just with 2 moms.

1348495,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B003L20ICE,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","****1/2One of the most striking things about the ""feel-good"" drama ""The Kids Are All Right"" is that the characters are not always all that easy to like.  They can be moody and naggy, petulant and prickly, immature and self-absorbed; they do and say a lot of stupid, immoral and hurtful things - yet we never question the love they have for one another.Annette Benning and Julianne Moore play Nic and Jules, a middle-aged lesbian couple with two teenaged children, 18-year-old Joni (Mia Wasikowaski), who is all set to go off to college, and 15 year-old Laser (Josh Hutcherson), who's become suddenly curious about the anonymous sperm donor who is his biological father.  After some initial hesitation on the part of Joni, the youngsters set up a meeting with the man, a never-married, motorcycle-riding restaurateur and all-around free spirit named Paul (Mark Ruffalo), whose sudden insinuating of himself into the life of the family results in a great deal of consternation and tension for all concerned.The relationship dynamics in the screenplay by Stuart Bloomberg and director Lisa Cholodenko are intense and complex.  With a career as an obstetrician, Nic is the more ""grounded"" of the two women, even though she may be a borderline alcoholic and secretly resents the fact that the more fitfully employed Jules doesn't seem to be able to pull her own weight financially.  This leads to a tremendous amount of tension between the two, a condition that is greatly exacerbated when the less self-confident and less uptight Jules steps across a clearly forbidden line in their marriage.  Nic and Jules also seem to be suffering from the ""fatigue-factor"" that seems to creep into just about every relationship once the individuals have been together for too long.  They have even begun to question their feelings for one another, and wonder if the love that was once there so intensely still exists at all - or whether they're just staying together because it`s safe and comfortable to do so and the thought of starting over with someone else is just too daunting a prospect to seriously contemplate.Meanwhile, Paul falls in love with the idea of becoming a dad to two grown kids he clearly likes, but his own unrealistic expectations and lack of maturity threaten to doom any efforts in that direction.  The kids, meanwhile, who often seem more keenly aware of what is going on than the adults involved, frequently become collateral damage in the battle of relationships being waged around them.Benning, who's already garnered universal praise and numerous awards for her work in this film, is not afraid to bring a harsh edge to the role of the often overbearing Nic, almost daring the audience not to like her at times.  Moore has the less flashy part, but she nicely conveys the insecurity and vulnerability of the character she`s playing.  Ruffalo perfectly captures the well-meaning clumsiness of a man too long used to being focused on his own needs and desires to suddenly become a man dedicated to the lives of others.  And Wasikowska and Hutcherson are appealing and touching as the kids who may be all right in the long run but who are going through some pretty tough times at the moment.The major selling point of ""The Kids Are All Right"" is, of course, that it centers around what many in society see as an ""unconventional"" family, yet the movie itself couldn't be more universal in what it has to say about what it means to be a family and what it means to be in a committed relationship.

It starts off being about the kids and their need to know who their biological father is, and then it turns into a ""soap opera-like"" affair between the donor and one of the lesbian moms. Frankly, I found the squabbling between the lesbians to be a tired, cliche-driven, melodramatic plotline. What was the point of it all? That a member of a gay marriage can feel just as under-appreciated as a member of a straight marriage? Wow. I paid 10 bucks to find that out. Really big deal. I was much more interested to discover more about the kids. (After all that was the title of the film.) I wanted to see more interaction between them and their biological dad. I wanted to find out how their biological dad affected their lives--especially the boy who lacked a father figure and was the one who initially wanted to find out who the donor was. You can tell this boy, Laser, lacked self-confidence. He let his ""best friend"" Clay bully him around. You can also tell that the biological dad, Paul, was probably bullied around too when he was Laser's age. That could've been the reason why he didn't like team sports. Laser and Paul could've had a much more meaningful connection in the story. But instead we were stuck with this lesbian soap opera jamboree. It didn't seem like the writer knew what she wanted to do with this story. It was going off in too many directions and subsequently lost its focus. So the kids lost respect for their biological dad because he had an affair with one of their moms. That was the whole point of having the kids in the story???

Maybe they think that since Jules and Nic are lesbians, neither could ever have a heterosexual relationship.  What if the couple were heterosexuals - would a same-sex dalliance be more believable?Although the affair is somewhat predictable as a plot device, I did not have any problem believing that it could happen.  Jules is frightfully insecure, Paul is about as laid-back as it gets and he is paying her some positive attention.  Yes, he takes advantage of her vulnerability, he is flawed as are most of the other characters in some way.  He also provides both kids with some valuable companionship and guidance.  It is good for them both to have a father figure in their lives - the estrogen in that house can get pretty oppressive.I think Jules's speech toward the end where she says they are a family like any other family, they mess up but they love each other and she is sorry and hopes they can forgive her, is crucial.  That's the point.  They are a family and they do love each other.  I think Paul would dearly love to be part of that family but he closed the door on that opportunity when he went to bed with Jules.  Then he's a jerk to Tanya.  So I feel sorry for him but I think he deserved what he got.As for the ending, I bought it.  Not that they are going to put it behind them forever, but they acknowledge that they need and love each other, and at least in that moment they are committed to trying to make the relationship work.As almost every reviewer has pointed out, the acting is uniformly superb.

And I love Julianne Moore no matter what she's in.  Then, when it got nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actor I knew I wanted to see it no matter what.It's the story of a lesbian couple, Nic and Jules, played by Annette Bening and Julianne Moore who have two kids - Joni and Laser.  They are a close family.  Joni is 18 and this is her last summer at home before college.  Laser is 15 and enjoys sports and hanging out with his best friend.  Nic and Jules are still in love with each other and seem to have the perfect marriage and family until the kids locate the man who was their sperm donor.  He's a cool grungy guy named Paul, played by Mark Ruffalo, who runs a restaurant and an organic community garden.The kids like Paul and want to connect and hang out with him.  There are several awkward moments, as there should be, as they search for things to talk about and Paul honestly tries to learn about who ""his"" kids are.  Nic, the dominant one of the two Moms, decides they should have Paul over and meet him too.  But it's the chemistry between Paul and Jules that is about to turn everything upside down.The awkwardness between characters in different scenes presents itself as some perfect laugh out loud comedy.  Nic and Jules have a romantic moment alone in their bedroom and watch gay man porn for stimulation.  Later, the Moms catch Laser and his friend watching their DVD and try to get their son to talk to them about it if he's gay, although he isn't.This is a stellar cast.  I loved Josh Hutcherson as Laser.  He has some excellent scenes that show a lot of heart and emotion, such as playing basketball with Paul and asking if he'd rather be buried or cremated, and Paul asks him if he prefers Nike or New Balance.  Paul shuns his ""cool"" friend Clay for wanting to urinate on a stray dog that wanders by, then the two trade punches in the face.  Joni, played by Mia Wasikowska,  also has her classic moments too - picking vegetables with Paul and getting a ride home from him on his motorcycle, even though her moms hate motorcycles, or playing scrabble with her ""boy"" friend while her sex crazed girl friend drools over jocks in the yearbook.The only problem the movie has is its lack of intensity when the conflict is finally out in the open.  We build to it with intensity, but then are let down a bit by the outcome. Each character quickly deals with it in their own way, and then the movie is just pushed forward to its obvious heartfelt end.  But overall, I still loved the movie.  I was totally caught off guard by it, and that made me appreciate it even more.

The acting is pitch perfect from Annette Bening (in her second grand slam performance this year, after ""Mother and Child""), Julianne Moore (always incredible) and Mark Ruffalo (in a surprisingly honest performance). It's also the kids who add serious credibility, with the insanely perfect Josh Hutcherson and Mia Wasikowska (making up for ""Alice in Wonderland"" in spades, isn't it amazing what a little character motivation can do for an actress?). The films emotional arc always rings true and the final moments of the film are layered, emotional, and moving in so many unexpected ways.

Mostly I was drawn by the two lead actresses, Benning and Moore, who have long been among my favorites. They did not let me down. Both break new ground with what one other reviewer has call ""pitch perfect"" performances in uncharacteristic roles. Benning's silent, stunned slow burn, as she realizes what has been transpiring between her partner and the Mark Ruffalo character, will surely go down as one of the great moments of cinematic acting.While very entertaining in a first viewing, I have the feeling that this film will repay many more viewings. It comes on as a conventional genre family comedy/drama and proceeds to draw us deeper (not altogether willingly) with each successive scene. Although the ending can be construed as hopeful, it leaves many issues unresolved, more like a comma than a period. It left me with substantial characters who live and grow in my memory.

But, the truth is, while unquestionably well-acted and occasionally amusing (at least in the scene when the two moms think they're having a discussion with their son about his sexuality and he's trying to tell them about his bio dad), it overall was just a dumb--almost to the point of nonsensical--story with the main theme seemingly ""lesbians just can't resist penises,"" which struck me as not only odd, but offensive. From having the main characters watch gay male porn in order to get off, to Julianne Moore's bizarrely, and blithely, jumping into bed with her children's biological father for absolutely no reason what-so-ever. Her scream of excitement and revelation when she removes his pants during their initial encounter was almost laughable in its silliness. Straight or gay, who does that? This insightful moment is then followed by way too many variations of them having sex (going for the Cinemax After Dark crowd here?), day after day, while Moore goes home to her unknowing wife, who has long supported her financially and emotionally, with nary a guilty moment ... Unless you count firing her lone employee after he suspects the couple's affair. In the end, Annette Benning discovers the affair, but the marriage is ""saved"" by cutting the father figure out of their, and their childrens', lives forever. Pish, posh, problem solved.Was the point to show that men really are unneeded and only complicate women's lives or that Mark Ruffalo is so irresistable even gay women gotta get some of that? What does that say about the couples' own son whose behavior has him SCREAMING for a positive male role model, which Ruffalo's character quickly became, only to have his moms summarily remove that much-needed male influence due to (at least one of their) own misdeeds? Are they planning a sequel where the dumbly named, and never explained (though they go to pains to point out the daughter is named after Joni Mitchell), ""Laser"" goes on a drug-fueled killing spree with his friend Chuck?And speaking of unexplained and offensive ... How about each mom's creepy favoritism for the child she bore. Had to be an intentional plot point it was so obvious, yet never mentioned. Even as subtext is it supposed to reflect that this family knows very little about love?The set-up for the story--a longtime lesbian couple's teenage children meet and get to know their sperm donor--is interesting and had amazing potential. As does the idea of a marriage and family surviving an affair. The ideas were there and the cast top-notch, but the story line was, simply put, insulting.

1348511,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003L20ICE,Turfseer,"[1, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***One of the stronger entries in the crowded Independent Film market this year is 'The Kids Are Alright'.  The subject matter is refreshing as fairly normal middle-class lesbian couples, played here by Annette Benning (Nic) and Julianne Moore (Jules), have not been the usual focus of many mainstream films in recent years.Writers Lisa Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg aim more for comedy in the beginning of their story with Nic and Jules revealing a penchant for watching gay male porno tapes.  At the same time, they are both involved in the serious business of raising two teenage children, who were conceived from the same sperm donor.  Jules treats their son Laser to a slightly tortured explanation as to why she and Nic enjoy watching those porno tapes and it's all part and parcel of the parents trying to be overly transparent in their day-to-day dealings with their children.The ordinary world of Nic and Jules is interrupted when Laser conscripts his older sister, Joni, to find their father, the sperm donor.  He turns out to be a free spirit, Bohemian-type, Paul, who runs a restaurant with an organic garden in the backyard.  Paul of course agrees to meet with the kids and they immediately bond.Stories about free spirit 'interlopers' (the term that Nic uses to pejoratively to dismiss Paul at the film's climax) are nothing new.  Two prior films (much lighter in tone) are 'Belle Epoque' (which received the Oscar for Best Foreign Lanugage film from Spain in 1993) and the joint Anglo-Irish production, 'About Adam' (2000) both of which introduce a quirky but likable Lothario who ends up seducing a family of women who cannot resist his charms.  But unlike the aforementioned films where the seducer is welcomed by the women he seduces and there are no malevolent consequences, here Paul's seduction of Jules, is viewed as a violation of the family's space.  Hence, Paul is ultimately cast as a villain and banished from any further contact with each member of the family unit.The story proceeds quietly with a haunting guitar soundtrack underneath. Paul is invited over to dinner by Nic and Jules and eventually offers Jules a job working on the landscaping for his organic garden. Nic argues with Paul after he takes Joni for a ride on his motorcycle. Nic backs down and suggests that they go over to Paul's house for dinner. In a great scene, Paul and Nic bond over Joni Mitchell's 'Blue' album. But soon afterward, disaster strikes: Nic discovers traces of Jules' hair in Paul's bathroom and bedroom.Strip away the lesbian subtext and 'The Kids are Alright' becomes a conventional tale about the effect of an affair on a middle-aged relationship. Still, the story is full of nuances. For one thing, Paul, despite his immaturity, is not such a bad guy after all. His negative opinion of Laser's best friend Clay (a kid who enjoys torturing animals) is borne out toward the end of the film when Laser has a fight with Clay and dumps him. Annette Benning steals the show as the obstetrician breadwinner, who predictably can't contain her contempt for her partner's dabbling in fleeting New Age pursuits (note the scene where Nic storms out of the restaurant after denouncing Jules' new found interest in composting). I didn't get as good a handle on Jules, whose middle-aged malaise is not as sharply defined as Nic's more stable weltanschauung.If there is a wrong note in the film, it's Paul's sudden decision to settle down with Jules, a woman who is openly gay and he hardly knows at all. What is it about Jules that causes Paul to dump his attractive girlfriend and destroy the excellent bond he's established with the two kids? I suppose Paul's behavior must be classified under the moniker of 'impetuousness'.Rather than comedy, I would consider 'Kids' more of a 'dramedy'. There's something very wistful about how Paul (basically a nice guy), must be thrown under the bus in order to repair the more important relationship that Nic and Jules have established over the years. Hopefully, if the kids are 'alright', they may end up forgiving Paul down the road, and re-establish contact with him.'The Kids are Alright' is not a complicated story but it pulls you in precisely because one wants to know Paul's fate, vis-a-vis his relationship with Jules and Nic. In the end, Nic forgives Jules and the bond between the kids (so seriously disrupted due to Paul the 'interloper') is now repaired as the family delivers Joni to college and savor the bittersweet moment as the daughter takes her first steps toward complete independence.The performances here are uniformly excellent as the actors have a script with excellent dialogue to work with. Perhaps the most prescient line is delivered by Lazer at the end when he tells his parents that they must stay together because they're ""old"".",4,Sensitive tale of challenge to Lesbian couple's

If nothing else, the scene with Bening and Moore and another couple, in a restaurant having a conversation about organics and being green, is worth the price alone!The Kids Are All Right",4,Modern Day Struggles,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,654,"['Everyone', 'commendable', 'performance', 'film', 'Kids', 'Are', 'All', 'Right', 'confronts', 'issues', 'diversity', 'belonging', 'search', 'self', 'so', 'humor', 'pathos', 'honesty', 'Even', 'story', 'line', 'might', 'seem', 'contrived', 'not', 'plausible', 'times', 'are', 'real', 'there', 'know', 'personal', 'truth', 'Ever-changing', 'family', 'constellations', 'challenges', 'are', 'inherent', 'are', 'explored', 'highlighted', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'nothing', 'else', 'scene', 'Bening', 'Moore', 'couple', 'restaurant', 'having', 'conversation', 'organics', 'being', 'green', 'price', 'alone', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Right']",N/A

Conflicts ensue as the couple's problems surface with a vengeance, one partner has a fling with the donor daddy, and the kids are caught up in the turmoil.The actors turn in very strong performances here, and the script and direction are good as well.

Mom and Mom have as stable a relationship as any, which is to say there are plenty of rough spots to deal with, including plenty of affectionate friction with the teenaged kids. Not surprisingly, the fifteen year old boy, Laser, wants to know about the sperm donor who got him started. With help from his sister, legally of age to inquire about their shared but anonymous father, they find him. He turns out to be fun, exciting, and just enough of a ""bad boy"" to add some adventure to their lives.I've actually seen something similar happen: a teenager developed a desperate need to find a biological parent, found same, and enjoyed a brief honeymoon of good feelings between the long-lost whoevers. That fell apart in predictably short order, as does the reunion in this movie - but, in this script, lots more falls apart, too. Pretty much everything and everyone, in fact. You can't blame a fifteen year old boy for acting like a teenager, but the nominal grownups weren't functioning very much better. In a happy-enough ending, everyone ends up where they should except maybe Tanya, a lovely and loving lady playing the role of collateral damage.BTW, a phrasebook might help in understanding some of the movie's more confusing passages. Herewith, I offer some translations.""Is there anything you want to tell us?"" really means ""There's a specific topic we want to discuss, and your life won't be worth living if you guess wrong.""""You can talk about anything with us"" really means ""As long as it's not what's important to you.""And of course, ""We won't judge you"" means, ""but only if you guess not only the question we have in mind, but the answer we have in mind as well.""-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release",3,"Yes, they're all right ...",1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,1762,"['everyone', 'else', 'sort', 'mess', 'Mom', 'Mom', 'have', 'stable', 'relationship', 'say', 'are', 'plenty', 'rough', 'spots', 'deal', 'including', 'plenty', 'affectionate', 'friction', 'teenaged', 'kids', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'Laser', 'know', 'sperm', 'donor', 'who', 'got', 'started', 'help', 'sister', 'legally', 'age', 'inquire', 'shared', 'anonymous', 'father', 'find', 'out', 'be', 'fun', 'exciting', 'just', 'enough', 'bad', 'boy', 'add', 'adventure', 'lives.I', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'seen', 'something', 'similar', 'happen', 'teenager', 'developed', 'desperate', 'need', 'find', 'biological', 'parent', 'found', 'same', 'enjoyed', 'brief', 'honeymoon', 'good', 'feelings', 'long-lost', 'whoevers', 'fell', 'apart', 'predictably', 'short', 'order', 'reunion', 'movie', 'script', 'lots', 'more', 'falls', 'apart', 'too', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'everyone', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'acting', 'teenager', 'nominal', 'grownups', 'were', ""n't"", 'functioning', 'very', 'much', 'better', 'happy-enough', 'ending', 'everyone', 'up', 'where', 'should', 'except', 'maybe', 'Tanya', 'lovely', 'loving', 'lady', 'playing', 'role', 'collateral', 'damage.BTW', 'phrasebook', 'might', 'help', 'understanding', 'movie', 'more', 'confusing', 'passages', 'Herewith', 'offer', 'translations', 'there', 'anything', 'want', 'tell', 'really', 'specific', 'topic', 'want', 'discuss', 'life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'worth', 'living', 'guess', 'wrong', 'can', 'talk', 'anything', 'really', 'As', 'long', 'not', 'what', 'important', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'judge', 'only', 'guess', 'not', 'only', 'question', 'have', 'mind', 'answer', 'have', 'mind', 'well', 'wiredweird', 'reviewing', 'theatrical', 'release']",N/A
