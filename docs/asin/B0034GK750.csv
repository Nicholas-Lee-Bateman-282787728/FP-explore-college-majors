This is the story of a girl who gets stuck next to a guy at a wedding that she takes a dislike to. A somewhat hard-to-believe situation involving her moving van being stolen leads to her making a deal with him to stage a fake wedding in order to get presents to outfit the house. The seem to despise each other but be willing to work together. As the movie progresses, the guy, who happens to be in debt to a loan shark, starts to make a better impression and they inevitably start to fall for each other. The whole part of the plot that involves the plan to get presents is fairly ridiculous but it doesn't overpower the aspects of the plot that involve the relationship between the two characters. The movie will never win any awards for great writing or acting, but somehow, in the end, it kind of works and leaves you with a nice feeling in spite of a number of shortfalls. As far as TV romantic comedies go, this one is probably just a bit above average and worth checking out if you want a low-key and clean movie to watch.",4,Serviceable but not great,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,1138,"['TV', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fancy', 'effects', 'expensive', 'sets', 'definitely', 'case', 'here', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'stuck', 'next', 'guy', 'wedding', 'dislike', 'somewhat', 'hard-to-believe', 'situation', 'involving', 'moving', 'van', 'being', 'stolen', 'leads', 'making', 'deal', 'stage', 'fake', 'wedding', 'order', 'get', 'presents', 'outfit', 'house', 'seem', 'despise', 'other', 'be', 'willing', 'work', 'together', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'debt', 'loan', 'shark', 'make', 'better', 'impression', 'inevitably', 'start', 'fall', 'other', 'whole', 'part', 'plot', 'plan', 'get', 'presents', 'fairly', 'ridiculous', ""n't"", 'overpower', 'aspects', 'plot', 'involve', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'movie', 'will', 'never', 'win', 'awards', 'great', 'writing', 'acting', 'somehow', 'end', 'kind', 'works', 'nice', 'feeling', 'spite', 'number', 'shortfalls', 'As', 'far', 'TV', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'go', 'one', 'probably', 'just', 'bit', 'above', 'average', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'want', 'low-key', 'clean', 'movie', 'watch']",N/A

I really like Melisa Joan Hart and wanted to like this movie but it just left me cold.  I think my negative review also has to do with the plot of the movie.  She is playing the part of the more 'mature' one in the relationship yet is willing to bilk all her family and friends for the sake of getting a bunch of money and stuff from a fake/arranged marriage.  I think she just came across as shallow as Joey in the movie.  If the comedy was better in the movie it might make the selfishness of the plot less glaring.
