192910,AEOBOF2ONQJWV,1583500286,"BR ""Nightsky Weaverwombon""","[3, 5]","Indeed, this wonderful trilogy is all those things and more!  It tells the herstory of Womyn's Spirituality by tracing the roots of religion back through time to when Womyn ruled the world and all Humanity worshipped The Great Goddess!  Then it takes our herstory forward and examines the Burning Times when nine million people were excuted during the Witch Craze.  80% of those who died were Womyn!  Then it talks about the modern Pagan, Goddess-Worshipping revival of which I am lucky enough to be a small part!Reccomended to anyone interested in Neo-Pagaism and/or The Old Ways, especially my Sister Dianic Witches!",5,"WOW!

Great for group viewing (Women's clubs, Covens, Study Groups, high school or college classes,  parents groups) and follow-up discussions as well.  The audio quality in  the second video -only- is a little funky in places.

As unspeakably horrible as it was, it wasn't the only one of its kind in Europe.Earlier centuries saw thousands of women systematically murdered for their simple, unadvertised, beliefs in the Old Ways, a beautiful pagan religious view that judges no one and seeks no vengeance.  THE BURNING TIMES is a beautiful account of women who were marched to their deaths for perceived blasphemy and witchcraft; GODDESS REMEMBERED is a somewhat thorough explanation of the religion and its history and practices today--it could be more thorough, but the filmmakers did go to the trouble of shooting on location in several instances.This trilogy is wonderful because it's not preachy, but informative instead.  I'm not necessarily a follower of this particular religion (or any religion) but I still enjoy this series as history.  Other books may be necessary to learn about the tenants of the religion itself, and it may well be worthwhile to indulge in a worship meant to be so celebratory of women.",5,"The forgotten Holocaust revealed, and more",1020297600,"05 2, 2002",2002,1095,"['When', 'one', 'one', 'inevitably', 'thinking', '20th', 'century', 'massacre', 'Jews', 'Europe', 'unspeakably', 'horrible', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'kind', 'Europe.Earlier', 'centuries', 'saw', 'thousands', 'women', 'systematically', 'murdered', 'simple', 'unadvertised', 'beliefs', 'Old', 'Ways', 'beautiful', 'pagan', 'religious', 'view', 'judges', 'one', 'vengeance', 'BURNING', 'TIMES', 'beautiful', 'account', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'marched', 'deaths', 'perceived', 'blasphemy', 'witchcraft', 'GODDESS', 'REMEMBERED', 'somewhat', 'thorough', 'explanation', 'religion', 'history', 'practices', 'today', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'thorough', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'go', 'trouble', 'shooting', 'location', 'several', 'instances.This', 'trilogy', 'wonderful', 'not', 'preachy', 'informative', 'instead', ""'m"", 'not', 'necessarily', 'follower', 'particular', 'religion', 'religion', 'still', 'enjoy', 'series', 'history', 'Other', 'books', 'may', 'be', 'necessary', 'learn', 'tenants', 'religion', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'indulge', 'worship', 'meant', 'be', 'so', 'celebratory', 'women']",N/A
