I have faithfully followed all the seasons, and Season Seven [1990-1991] is as entertaining as ever.As with Season Six, J.B. Fletcher does not appear as a central character in all of the episodes. In all, there are about 5 episodes without Ms Fletcher where Dennis Stanton [former jewel thief turned insurance investigator] solves the murder mystery.Even without Angela Lansbury's Ms Fletcher solving the mysteries, the stories are so well-written and acted that it is still fun to watch them.Of course, the regulars are a hoot to watch as usual! Angela Lansbury is flawless in her role as super sleuth J.B. Fletcher, and there are of course  William Windom as Dr Seth Hazlitt, Richard Paul as mayor Sam Booth, Jerry Orbach as PI Harry McGraw, Ron Masak playing Sheriff Mort Metzger etc.Some of my favorite episodes in this season are ""The Family Jewels"" [a murder during a political fundraiser for Jessica's old friend reveals a rich woman's past], ""A Body to Die For"" [a male fitness instructor who seems to have dazzled the females of Cabot Cove is accused of murder], ""The Family Doctor"" [Seth and Jessica get involved with a mob family]& ""The Prodigal Father"" [set in Cabot Cove, Jessica helps her neighbor solve the mystery of her long-lost father's return to Cabot Cove, and subsequent murder].All in all, another entertaining season of MSW. I hope the later seasons [9-12] will be made available on DVD soon!",5,Another wonderful season of MSW!,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,1515,"['have', 'loved', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'thirteen', 'year-old', 'back', '1984', 'have', 'faithfully', 'followed', 'seasons', 'Season', 'Seven', '[', '1990-1991', ']', 'as', 'entertaining', 'ever.As', 'Season', 'Six', 'J.B.', 'Fletcher', 'not', 'appear', 'central', 'character', 'episodes', 'are', '5', 'episodes', 'Ms', 'Fletcher', 'where', 'Dennis', 'Stanton', '[', 'former', 'jewel', 'thief', 'turned', 'insurance', 'investigator', ']', 'murder', 'mystery.Even', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'Ms', 'Fletcher', 'solving', 'mysteries', 'stories', 'are', 'so', 'well-written', 'acted', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'them.Of', 'course', 'regulars', 'are', 'hoot', 'watch', 'usual', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'flawless', 'role', 'super', 'sleuth', 'J.B.', 'Fletcher', 'are', 'course', 'William', 'Windom', 'Dr', 'Seth', 'Hazlitt', 'Richard', 'Paul', 'mayor', 'Sam', 'Booth', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'PI', 'Harry', 'McGraw', 'Ron', 'Masak', 'playing', 'Sheriff', 'Mort', 'Metzger', 'etc.Some', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'murder', 'political', 'fundraiser', 'Jessica', 'old', 'friend', 'rich', 'woman', 'past', ']', 'Body', 'Die', 'male', 'fitness', 'instructor', 'who', 'have', 'dazzled', 'females', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'accused', 'murder', ']', 'Family', 'Doctor', '[', 'Seth', 'Jessica', 'get', 'involved', 'mob', 'family', ']', 'Prodigal', 'Father', '[', 'set', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'Jessica', 'neighbor', 'solve', 'mystery', 'long-lost', 'father', 'return', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'subsequent', 'murder', ']', '.All', 'entertaining', 'season', 'MSW', 'hope', 'later', 'seasons', '[', '9-12', ']', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'DVD', 'soon']","Murder, She Wrote: The Complete Seventh Season"
