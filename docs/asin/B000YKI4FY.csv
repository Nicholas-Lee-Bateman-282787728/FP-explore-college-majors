1120187,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000YKI4FY,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Having read John Burnham Schwartz's novel (I gave the novel 5 stars in my review) and being huge fans of Phoenix and Ruffalo (I tend to enjoy Connelly as well) I was really excited about this movie.  In fact, generally at the beginning of every year I pick a film that I'm most excited about, and I rally behind it until Oscar comes.  Some years I go well, others I do not.  Last year I stood firmly behind `Reservation Road', utterly convinced that it was going to be the best movie of the year.I had an off year.There are some significant changes from the novel here, while the initial story does stay the same, but it is not the changes but the delivery that really ruins the film for me.  Director Terry George doesn't know how to develop this film properly, at all.Where was Todd Field when you needed him?Ethan Learner is a college professor who loves his wife and his two children very much.  Dwight Arno is a divorced lawyer trying desperately to connect with his son despite his ex-wife's opposition.  One fateful evening Dwight makes a fatal mistake and kills Ethan's young son.  Instead of owning up to it he panics and drives off, covering over the evidence and continuing as if nothing happened.  Ethan is ravaged with anger as he sets out to find the person responsible for his son's death, causing strains in his marriage.  Dwight is racked with guilt but he cannot seem to come to terms with what needs to be done.  Things are only made worse when Ethan hires Dwight as his lawyer and urges him to help track down the killer.I'm telling you, the novel is a marvelous character study and truly gets under the skin of Ethan, Grace (his wife) and Dwight beautifully.The problem with `Reservation Road' is that it doesn't take the time to fully flesh out these characters.  It feels rather hurried to me.  Mark Ruffalo does all he can to convey his characters guilt but it never feels as genuine as it should.  The film also feels very uninterested in Grace, which is sad since it was her character that seemed to devour the novel.  She is obviously not the star of the show (this is more about the way that men react to these situations) but in the novel it was her sections that brought a new light to the proceedings.  Here she is nothing more than window dressing.  Phoenix, who I consider one of our finer actors, has never been worse.  I thought that his performance was weak and amateurish.  I don't think he fully understood the character.  He's said that he related more to Dwight, and so maybe he should have swapped roles with Ruffalo.I was very disappointed in the way the film handled Ethan and Grace's relationship.  Every time they shared the screen they were having the same conversation, which bogged the film down and made it feel redundant.  Phoenix's groveling never felt genuine, it always felt forced and uncomfortable.  Connelly tried to save her scenes, but Phoenix was such a bore that I found my interest waning considerably.  I understand that this is a tragic situation, and really, there is no getting over that, but this is a movie and movie's need to be able to portray things in an engaging manor.  Repeating the same sequence of events, no matter how realistic it may be, is not engaging.I will say that the ending was a plus for me, the fact that they kept the novel's ending and the final frame is quite haunting, but it is one of the films sole highlights.The film is not bad, it just isn't good either.  It's right there in the middle.  It's average at best, which is sad because it could have, and should have been phenomenal.  Ruffalo is decent, to a degree and Connelly is actually very effective in the few scenes where she is allowed to shine.  I just think that Terry George botched this one big time, taking what could have been a very poignant and emotional look at family and giving it more of a `made for television' feel, muddling it down with an air of stiffness and pulling away from it's power by watering down the emotion.I'd give it a C-, maybe a C.Go watch `In the Bedroom'.

1120191,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000YKI4FY,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 2]","Raw and gritty, the angst in Terry George's `Reservation Road' disturbs without the redeemable satisfaction of an ending that vindicates the one hour and 43 minutes invested in its viewing.  Pain and grief drive this tale of two upper echelon fathers living in upper middle class Connecticut.  George attempts to alternate the telling of the story from the respective vantage points of each of the main protagonists, as does John Burnham Schwartz in his original novel.  He fails somewhat; in attempting to show the similarities between the two he brute forces the end product, somehow homogenizing the bottom line into a passion play of little relevance.The connection between the two men, Joaquin Phoenix as Ethan Learner, college professor and Mark Ruffolo as Dwight Arno, lawyer, arises when Dwight, already late in delivering his son Lucas to his estranged wife and in jeopardy of breaching his visitation privileges, kills the young and talented cello prodigy, Josh Learner, in a hit and run accident. Wracked with guilty, Dwight fluctuates between knowing he must turn himself in and the realization that his life as it is will irreparably change.  Ruffolo plays Arno with such a sick hang dog face that suggests too obvious a culpability that one wonders how anyone who comes into contact with him cannot know of his crime. On the other hand, Phoenix smolders with hatred and helplessness for his son's unknown killer, trawling the Internet at night for some kind of understanding from other families of hit and run victims.  His wife, Grace (Jennifer Connelly) equally bereaved wants to move on, concentrating on their other child.  We watch with a harried fascination as the Learner's marriage begins to disintegrate--the tragedy is too large for them to weather let along comprehend.  There is nothing remarkably psychological about either man's course of thought or action; both move along like automatons preprogrammed to self-destruct.  Absolutes like Vengeance and Guilt leave little room for nuanced behaviors.With just this introductory information, you can already figure out the rest of the plot and it's ending.  Eventually, Ethan discovers that Dwight is responsible for his son's death.  Their confrontation rewards the audience with little joy at the righteousness of vindication.  Instead the predictable climax deflates like a prognosis of terminal cancer; the adjunct players must deal with the aftermath of the inevitable societal chemotherapy and radiation that rips their family immune systems to shreds. The audience watches with equally clinical detachment.Bottom line?  Reminiscent of the hotbed of grief and pain moving the characters in Barbet Schroeder's 1996 film  `Before and After', Terry George's `Reservation Road' also focuses on an upper echelon of society living a life fueled by the rewards of education and wealth, yet still trapped by out-of-control events that could happen to anyone of any circumstance but result in crushing tragedy that cannot be reasoned away.  Both Mark Ruffolo and Joaquin Phoenix excel in their roles as the prospective fathers, but for the most part, each of these actors' performances borders on caricatures of the emotions they represent rather than full-fledged multi-faceted personalities that are nudged by the other concerns of everyday life.

This was a fine example of acting at its realist and purist. The movie, though very limited in release, like the other 'We Own The Night' Phoenix film, certainly deserved a much wider audience than it received.The brutal intensity of living the days that follow a hit and run home from a recital, and the victim being a son of only ten was never without sincerity and purpose. Joaquin Phoenix and the ever endearing Jennifer Connelly (what a long way from Labyrinth) play the tormented parents, who try to pick the pieces of their lives after their son was killed in a hit and run by Mark Ruffalo (who plays the lawyer who hits the boy while driving home from a Sox game). The chemistry between Phoenix and Connelly is electrifying, and Phoenix deserved, at best, an Academy Award nomination as his role was terrifyingly brilliant.The touching scenes in the aftermath and brutal honesty of the parents roles somehow still cannot save Reservation Road from being dry and blaze at times. It's of course somewhat predictable, but that isn't even the issue. I don't know exactly what was missing, but I never felt part of the film while watching, I felt as if I was just visiting en route for a shave, never really finding myself attaching to the chase, to the cause and routing on the family in hopes of never falling apart in the most horrid of situations. There is a softness that never seems to find a place in your heart. I mean you know you are part of extraordinary acting, but something comes up short in various levels of emotion, where you wished, in a sense, you had tears streaming down your eyes. (Kramer vs- Kramer stuff I was looking for emotionally.) Sadly the magic never comes, however, the stellar performances save an otherwise untangible film.Reservation Road is still one of the better films of 2007; an extraordinary year for so many awesome films that never got to see a larger target audience.Terry George (Hotel Rwanda) directs, and co-writes the screenplay based upon the book of the same name, by also co-screenwriter, John Burnham Schwartz.

I live in a metropolitan area, and I don't recall hearing about this.Anyway, Reservation Road is the story of two men: Ethan Learner and Dwight Arno. They both have young sons, who are presumably are about the same age. Learner is married w/one other child, and Arno is a divorcee who pretty much has to bend to his ex's will in order to maintain a relationship w/his son (the adorable Eddie Alderson from One Life to Live).  Both families are out one night (the Learners at Josh's cello recital and the Arnos at a Red Sox game).  Tragedy strikes when Dwight hits Josh with his car. No one sees any faces, and Dwight (clearly in shock) drives off.  Young Josh is dead and his father witnessed it happen.  Grief socks the family in the collective gut and bit by bit chips away at them. They blame each other, and grow apart unable to find peace.  The police try to find the hit-n-runner, but it proves futile, and a frustrated Ethan hires a law firm (one partner is Dwight) to help him stay on the police's case. Dwight already feeling guilty yet scared to turn himself in, finds the walls closing in fast.  Different events and actions of the characters tie Dwight with Ethan in more ways than Dwight can handle. Meanwhile, Ethan is becoming obsessed with avenging his son.  The climax of the movie finds Ethan remembering something about the accident and it sends him on a path that is understandable but not so smart.  The end wraps up rather neatly.I liked the movie mostly for the performances. Joaquin, Mark, and Jennifer turned in believable performances.  The story was mainly about the two fathers and their sons: Ethan loses his son, but tries to hold onto him through his things, while Dwight struggles to keep from losing his son (although not in such a tragic way). It was clear that each man would do anything for their sons, and in Dwight's case, that meant covering up his crime. Yep, in a twisted way, he wanted to protect his son and the image he has of his dad.  Lucas was in the car when they hit Josh and Dwight lied to him about this.But back to the performances, Mark and Joaquin both made me feel for their characters. Mark R effectively showed Dwight's descent as he grappled with his conscious on what he should do despite what he KNEW he should do.  Joaquin had a similar dissent into his own `madness.'  He becomes consumed with finding Josh's killer at the expense of his wife and young daughter who are lost in their own grief.  Jennifer Connelly gave a subdued performance. She lends a big name to the movie, but it was really obvious that it wasn't about the mother or the daughter.  She played the part well of a grieving parent who knew she had to make peace w/her son's death. It offered a stark contrast to Joaquin's character who essentially went in the opposite direction.  I also liked that we weren't treated to a case of two Academy nominees/winners competing to see who could outdo the other. Mira Sorvino's character was more of a cameo.  She had no development and her character was used to push a couple pieces of the plot.***SPOILER***I don't think I've given anything away at this point, but per my title, I just wanted to add that I'm glad Dwight didn't kill himself.  That would have been devastating to his son and a selfish way out. I'm equally glad that Ethan did not shoot him.",4,RESERVATION ROAD-SPOILER ALERT,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,3437,"['had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'movie', 'random', 'search', 'internet', 'When', 'do', 'movies', 'hit', 'theaters', 'live', 'metropolitan', 'area', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'hearing', 'this.Anyway', 'Reservation', 'Road', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'Ethan', 'Learner', 'Dwight', 'Arno', 'have', 'young', 'sons', 'who', 'are', 'presumably', 'are', 'same', 'age', 'Learner', 'married', 'other', 'child', 'Arno', 'divorcee', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'bend', 'ex', 'will', 'order', 'maintain', 'relationship', 'w/his', 'son', 'adorable', 'Eddie', 'Alderson', 'One', 'Life', 'Live', 'families', 'are', 'out', 'one', 'night', 'Learners', 'Josh', 'cello', 'recital', 'Arnos', 'Red', 'Sox', 'game', 'Tragedy', 'strikes', 'when', 'Dwight', 'Josh', 'car', 'one', 'Dwight', 'clearly', 'shock', 'off', 'Young', 'Josh', 'dead', 'father', 'witnessed', 'happen', 'Grief', 'family', 'collective', 'gut', 'bit', 'bit', 'chips', 'away', 'blame', 'other', 'grow', 'apart', 'unable', 'find', 'peace', 'police', 'try', 'find', 'hit-n-runner', 'futile', 'frustrated', 'Ethan', 'law', 'firm', 'one', 'partner', 'Dwight', 'help', 'stay', 'police', 'case', 'Dwight', 'already', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'yet', 'scared', 'turn', 'walls', 'closing', 'fast', 'Different', 'events', 'actions', 'characters', 'tie', 'Dwight', 'Ethan', 'more', 'ways', 'Dwight', 'can', 'handle', 'Meanwhile', 'Ethan', 'becoming', 'obsessed', 'avenging', 'son', 'climax', 'movie', 'Ethan', 'remembering', 'something', 'accident', 'path', 'understandable', 'not', 'so', 'smart', 'end', 'up', 'rather', 'neatly.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'mostly', 'performances', 'Joaquin', 'Mark', 'Jennifer', 'turned', 'believable', 'performances', 'story', 'was', 'mainly', 'two', 'fathers', 'sons', 'Ethan', 'son', 'tries', 'hold', 'things', 'Dwight', 'keep', 'losing', 'son', 'not', 'such', 'tragic', 'way', 'was', 'clear', 'man', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'sons', 'Dwight', 'case', 'meant', 'covering', 'up', 'crime', 'Yep', 'twisted', 'way', 'wanted', 'protect', 'son', 'image', 'dad', 'Lucas', 'was', 'car', 'when', 'hit', 'Josh', 'Dwight', 'lied', 'this.But', 'back', 'performances', 'Mark', 'Joaquin', 'made', 'feel', 'characters', 'Mark', 'R', 'effectively', 'showed', 'Dwight', 'descent', 'grappled', 'conscious', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'what', 'KNEW', 'should', 'do', 'Joaquin', 'had', 'similar', 'dissent', 'own', 'madness', 'consumed', 'finding', 'Josh', 'killer', 'expense', 'wife', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'are', 'lost', 'own', 'grief', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'gave', 'subdued', 'performance', 'big', 'name', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'obvious', 'was', ""n't"", 'mother', 'daughter', 'played', 'part', 'well', 'grieving', 'parent', 'who', 'knew', 'had', 'make', 'peace', 'son', 'death', 'offered', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Joaquin', 'character', 'who', 'essentially', 'went', 'opposite', 'direction', 'also', 'liked', 'were', ""n't"", 'treated', 'case', 'two', 'Academy', 'nominees/winners', 'competing', 'see', 'who', 'could', 'outdo', 'other', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'cameo', 'had', 'development', 'character', 'was', 'used', 'push', 'couple', 'pieces', 'plot', '***SPOILER***I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'given', 'anything', 'away', 'point', 'title', 'just', 'wanted', 'add', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Dwight', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'devastating', 'son', 'selfish', 'way', ""'m"", 'equally', 'glad', 'Ethan', 'did', 'not', 'shoot']",N/A
1120196,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000YKI4FY,Grady Harp,"[25, 28]","The profound effects of the accidental death of a child on three families is vividly portrayed in this dark film by writer/director Terry George ('Hotel Rwanda', Hart's War', 'In the Name of the Father') as adapted and co-written by John Burnham Schwartz on whose novel the film is based.  While it seems we are seeing a glut of films dealing with revenge on the part of injured people who feel the Law isn't fulfilling its duty, when a film such as RESERVATION ROAD  comes along the theme feels fresh.Ethan and Grace Learner (Joaquin Phoenix and Jennifer Connelly) and their children Josh (Sean Curley) and Emma (Elle Fanning) are the 'perfect family', living comfortably in Connecticut, until one night after a picnic where Josh captured fireflies for his sister, the family stops at a roadside station and while Josh releases the fireflies at his mother's request he is hit by a car and killed.  The driver of the car is Dwight Arno (Mark Ruffalo) who is trying to return his son Lucas (Eddie Alderson) to his estranged, remarried wife Ruth (Mira Sorvino) after a baseball game that ran too long.  Instead of stopping when he hits the child, Dwight drives on, not wanting to upset his son. Within the tragedy of the next week the Learners are devastated and feel the police are not finding the perpetrator.  They decide to engage a lawyer to assist the investigation and the lawyer they engage is Dwight, a man so torn by the sadness of his life that he is barely functioning - trying to find some solace in restoring a solid relationship with his son while dealing with the fact that he has killed another family's son.  The events that proceed reveal the agonies of the accident and  the effect of that death on both Ethan (enraged) and Grace (desperately trying to focus on her remaining child), and on Dwight (obsessed with guilt and driven to thoughts of suicide) and his ex-wife Ruth who acts as an unknowing intermediary.  The final effects on each of these bruised people bring a surprising  end to the story.The quality of acting is strong as we have come to expect with the likes of Phoenix, Connelly, Ruffalo and Sorvino, who bring us into the tough story with considerable commitment: we understand the thoughts and drives of each of these sad characters.  Adding to the sensitive atmosphere is yet another strong musical score by Mark Isham who understands the fine art of creating a soundtrack that enhances the story. The theme may be a bit repetitive and the script somewhat formulaic, but the emotional effect on the viewer cannot be denied.

1120199,A124N94JZBXV59,B000YKI4FY,John Caruso,"[4, 6]","[ No spoilers, I promise. ]I was persuaded to rent this film on the strength of the cast, and the reviews on the box as well.  And I wasn't disappointed in the cast; Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Connelly were at the top of their form, and though Joaquin Phoenix was out of his league he delivered one of his best performances as well.The problem was the script and story itself.  I watched this film with a friend, and we came to it completely fresh; neither of us had read the book, seen the previews, or read anything on the box outside of the review blurbs.  We had no idea what it was even about, beyond the title.  Nevertheless we were able to predict every single major event and several not-so-major plot points well in advance--so much so that in one case we were able to predict the very dialogue that would be delivered before we heard it.  I can't recall any other film I've seen that was as formulaic and obvious as this one.As transparent as the story was, it was also artificial, forcing the characters into actions and statements that simply were not in character.  It's a testament to the quality of the cast that they were able to rise above some of the awkward, scripted dialogue they were given, but nonetheless it was like watching great dancers being forced to perform in straitjackets.  I should say that not all (or even a majority) of the dialogue was as broken as that, but it was frequent enough to further undercut the forced and predictable story.A final note: this film has a pronounced political agenda that's telegraphed quite jarringly in a few instances.  This wasn't the source of my (or my friend's) deep dissatisfaction with the film, since it only became apparent after we'd seen the first few plot elements coming a mile away (literally, in one case) and had hit some of the potholes in the dialogue, and so our expectations were already plummeting.  But in retrospect it was clear that this agenda was what lay behind some of the contrived plotting.  It's a rare film or book that can rise above this kind of directed manipulation of the characters, and Reservation Road certainly wasn't one of those few.So in short, this is a flawed and utterly predictable film, with wonderful performances that almost--but not quite--redeem it enough to make it worth the investment of time.",2,An extraordinarily predictable film that's almost saved by great acting,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,2314,"['[', 'No', 'spoilers', 'promise', ']', 'was', 'persuaded', 'rent', 'film', 'strength', 'cast', 'reviews', 'box', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'cast', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'were', 'top', 'form', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'league', 'delivered', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'well.The', 'problem', 'was', 'script', 'story', 'watched', 'film', 'friend', 'came', 'completely', 'fresh', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'previews', 'read', 'anything', 'box', 'review', 'blurbs', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'even', 'about', 'title', 'were', 'able', 'predict', 'single', 'major', 'event', 'several', 'not-so-major', 'plot', 'points', 'well', 'advance', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'case', 'were', 'able', 'predict', 'very', 'dialogue', 'would', 'be', 'delivered', 'heard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'other', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'formulaic', 'obvious', 'one.As', 'transparent', 'story', 'was', 'was', 'also', 'artificial', 'forcing', 'characters', 'actions', 'statements', 'simply', 'were', 'not', 'character', 'testament', 'quality', 'cast', 'were', 'able', 'rise', 'awkward', 'scripted', 'dialogue', 'were', 'given', 'nonetheless', 'was', 'watching', 'great', 'dancers', 'being', 'forced', 'perform', 'straitjackets', 'should', 'say', 'not', 'even', 'majority', 'dialogue', 'was', 'as', 'broken', 'was', 'frequent', 'enough', 'further', 'undercut', 'forced', 'predictable', 'story.A', 'final', 'note', 'film', 'pronounced', 'political', 'agenda', 'telegraphed', 'quite', 'jarringly', 'few', 'instances', 'was', ""n't"", 'source', 'friend', 'deep', 'dissatisfaction', 'film', 'only', 'became', 'apparent', ""'d"", 'seen', 'first', 'few', 'plot', 'elements', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'literally', 'one', 'case', 'had', 'hit', 'potholes', 'dialogue', 'so', 'expectations', 'were', 'already', 'plummeting', 'retrospect', 'was', 'clear', 'agenda', 'was', 'what', 'lay', 'behind', 'contrived', 'plotting', 'rare', 'film', 'book', 'can', 'rise', 'kind', 'directed', 'manipulation', 'characters', 'Reservation', 'Road', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'few.So', 'short', 'flawed', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'film', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'redeem', 'enough', 'make', 'investment', 'time']",N/A
1120200,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B000YKI4FY,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[12, 13]","It has been hard to write this review, as I really loved the book and the author did work on the screenplay (which was ultimately trimmed by the director, I believe).The movie has so many strong points and it deals with one of the most painful losses a parent can endure - and in such a terribly tragic and sudden way, no warning at all.MAJOR SPOILER ALERT: When the Lerner family is driving home one night, they make a stop at a gas station. That is when their son gets out of the car to let some lightening bugs out of a jar, a car comes along, hits him and kills him - and two families' lives are forever changed. Joaquin Phoenix does a fine job as Ethan, the father of the dead boy. His anger is palpable. Also, if you see the DVD make sure you listen to his description of how hard it was for him to channel that anger. He actually had to talk to victims to get a sense of how they felt after losing a child.It is hard not to feel sorry for both fathers - the one whose son was killed and the one who accidentally was the killer. Dwight Arno is the man who happened to drive into the boy and his pervading sadness is crafted superbly by Mark Ruffalo, an actor who always seems on the edge of sadness to me.These men have wives, of course, and I don't mean to slight them - or the actresses behind their depiction. Jennifer Connelly is Grace, wife to Ethan and mother of the dead child. Mira Sorvino is equally strong as Dwight's wife, although they are divorced, but share custody of a son.Having noted the solid acting in this movie, I do have to add that the plot did disappoint, having such high expectations after having read the book. The movie came very, very close to capturing the tone of the book but I think (in this case) the book's style, word choice and tone did not translate well to film. I don't fault the actors and I'm not sure ANY script could have done justice to the book.What ended up on screen seemed overly long and somehow ""off"" from the perfection of the book's story. This is a very personal interpretation, of course, and others may well love this movie. Trying to catch the various facets of grief after a child dies is a difficult task for even the best of actors and actresses. Again, listening to Jennifer Connelly, Mark Ruffalo and the others speak about how they approached the movie might give some insight into why they came close - but fell short of the task.Connelly admits that she could not think of the subject personally or imagine such a tragedy happening to her own child. Joaquin Phoenix felt sympathy towards the other father and had to learn how to dredge up anger and pain. Ultimately, the result is a film with integrity and heart but still lacking the flow and strength that would have made it wholly compelling. Again, my take and bias may come from having read the book and wanting the movie to live up to that.I also want to note that I am a fan of Terry George, the man who made this movie. I loved Hotel Rwanda. This time around, however, I think the results weren't quite as spectacular.",4,"I'd like to have given this one 3 and 3/4 stars, having read the book...strong but flawed movie",1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,3048,"['been', 'hard', 'write', 'review', 'really', 'loved', 'book', 'author', 'did', 'work', 'screenplay', 'was', 'ultimately', 'trimmed', 'director', 'believe', '.The', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'strong', 'points', 'one', 'most', 'painful', 'losses', 'parent', 'can', 'endure', 'such', 'terribly', 'tragic', 'sudden', 'way', 'warning', 'all.MAJOR', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'When', 'Lerner', 'family', 'driving', 'home', 'one', 'night', 'make', 'stop', 'gas', 'station', 'when', 'son', 'car', 'let', 'lightening', 'bugs', 'jar', 'car', 'along', 'two', 'families', 'lives', 'are', 'forever', 'changed', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'fine', 'job', 'Ethan', 'father', 'dead', 'boy', 'anger', 'palpable', 'Also', 'see', 'DVD', 'make', 'sure', 'listen', 'description', 'how', 'hard', 'was', 'channel', 'anger', 'actually', 'had', 'talk', 'victims', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'felt', 'losing', 'child.It', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'sorry', 'fathers', 'one', 'son', 'was', 'killed', 'one', 'who', 'accidentally', 'was', 'killer', 'Dwight', 'Arno', 'man', 'who', 'happened', 'drive', 'boy', 'pervading', 'sadness', 'crafted', 'superbly', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'actor', 'who', 'always', 'edge', 'sadness', 'me.These', 'men', 'have', 'wives', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'slight', 'actresses', 'depiction', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Grace', 'wife', 'Ethan', 'mother', 'dead', 'child', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'equally', 'strong', 'Dwight', 'wife', 'are', 'divorced', 'share', 'custody', 'son.Having', 'noted', 'solid', 'acting', 'movie', 'do', 'have', 'add', 'plot', 'did', 'disappoint', 'having', 'such', 'high', 'expectations', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'came', 'very', 'very', 'close', 'capturing', 'tone', 'book', 'think', 'case', 'book', 'style', 'word', 'choice', 'tone', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'actors', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ANY', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'justice', 'book.What', 'ended', 'up', 'screen', 'seemed', 'overly', 'long', 'somehow', 'off', 'perfection', 'book', 'story', 'very', 'personal', 'interpretation', 'course', 'others', 'may', 'well', 'love', 'movie', 'Trying', 'catch', 'various', 'facets', 'grief', 'child', 'difficult', 'task', 'even', 'best', 'actors', 'actresses', 'Again', 'listening', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'others', 'speak', 'how', 'approached', 'movie', 'might', 'give', 'insight', 'why', 'came', 'close', 'fell', 'short', 'task.Connelly', 'could', 'not', 'think', 'subject', 'personally', 'imagine', 'such', 'tragedy', 'happening', 'own', 'child', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'other', 'father', 'had', 'learn', 'how', 'dredge', 'up', 'anger', 'pain', 'Ultimately', 'result', 'film', 'integrity', 'heart', 'still', 'lacking', 'flow', 'strength', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'wholly', 'compelling', 'Again', 'take', 'bias', 'may', 'come', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'wanting', 'movie', 'live', 'up', 'that.I', 'also', 'want', 'note', 'am', 'fan', 'Terry', 'George', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'loved', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'time', 'around', 'however', 'think', 'results', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'spectacular']",N/A

1120205,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000YKI4FY,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","Based on the novel by John Burnham Schwartz, ""Reservation Road"" is an extraordinarily compelling and beautifully acted drama that looks at a single tragic event - the hit-and-run death of a ten-year-old boy - from dueling perspectives.  One of those perspectives is of course that of the grieving family - the father, Ethan, the mother, Grace, and the little sister, Emma - as they attempt to come to terms with the single most unimaginable trial a family can face.  But the movie also looks at how the incident affects the man who ran over the boy, then fled in panic from the scene.  Dwight is a divorced lawyer with a young son of his own, and his life in this rural corner of Connecticut is torn asunder every bit as much as it is for the family of the dead boy.As Ethan comes to believe that the culprit will never be caught - and that the loophole-laden legal system will allow him to weasel out of any meaningful punishment even if he is - the emotionally decimated father decides to take matters into his own hands, much to the consternation of his wife, who would prefer he spend his time trying to heal the family and work to make it whole again.Despite the premise, ""Reservation Road"" is no cheap exploitative revenge-fantasy but rather a profoundly moving and insightful look into the various ways in which human beings cope with tragedy.  The parents' reactions to their son's death and to the utterly random, inexplicable cosmic injustice of it all could not be more palpable and real.  In the same way, the soul-crushing guilt with which Dwight is grappling - while having to put on a happy face for the world - makes us empathize with him as well, despite the fact that we certainly don't condone his actions on an ethical or intellectual level.  The beauty of the Terry George screenplay is that it refuses to judge any of its characters.  There are no heroes or villains here, just deeply flawed individuals doing things - out of fear, out of confusion, out of an instinct for self-preservation or an understandable craving for eye-for-an-eye justice - that they would never even dream of doing under ordinary circumstances.  But when the Fates suddenly deal one a blow this unforeseen and this devastating - showing us all just how vulnerable we truly are to having our lives forever shattered in the blink of an eye - all bets are off, and it often takes a Herculean act of the will to lead one back to that instinctive moral center that existed before the tragedy.  This is what both Ethan and Dwight are ultimately forced to learn from the experience.The plotting is taut (if a bit overly reliant on coincidence at times) and the direction by George sensitive and focused.  And Ruffalo and Phoenix deliver performances of such emotional intensity and lacerating truthfulness that I can't believe they weren't officially awarded for their efforts.But watching them and the film they're in is reward enough for the viewer.",5,a masterful and evenhanded social drama,1307491200,"06 8, 2011",2011,2942,"['Based', 'novel', 'John', 'Burnham', 'Schwartz', 'Reservation', 'Road', 'extraordinarily', 'compelling', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'drama', 'single', 'tragic', 'event', 'hit-and-run', 'death', 'ten-year-old', 'boy', 'dueling', 'perspectives', 'One', 'perspectives', 'course', 'grieving', 'family', 'father', 'Ethan', 'mother', 'Grace', 'little', 'sister', 'Emma', 'attempt', 'come', 'terms', 'single', 'most', 'unimaginable', 'trial', 'family', 'can', 'face', 'movie', 'also', 'how', 'incident', 'man', 'who', 'ran', 'boy', 'then', 'fled', 'panic', 'scene', 'Dwight', 'divorced', 'lawyer', 'young', 'son', 'own', 'life', 'rural', 'corner', 'Connecticut', 'torn', 'asunder', 'bit', 'as', 'much', 'family', 'dead', 'boy.As', 'Ethan', 'believe', 'culprit', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'caught', 'loophole-laden', 'legal', 'system', 'will', 'allow', 'weasel', 'meaningful', 'punishment', 'even', 'emotionally', 'decimated', 'father', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'much', 'consternation', 'wife', 'who', 'would', 'prefer', 'spend', 'time', 'trying', 'heal', 'family', 'work', 'make', 'whole', 'premise', 'Reservation', 'Road', 'cheap', 'exploitative', 'revenge-fantasy', 'rather', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'insightful', 'look', 'various', 'ways', 'human', 'beings', 'cope', 'tragedy', 'parents', 'reactions', 'son', 'death', 'utterly', 'random', 'inexplicable', 'cosmic', 'injustice', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'palpable', 'real', 'same', 'way', 'soul-crushing', 'guilt', 'Dwight', 'grappling', 'having', 'put', 'happy', 'face', 'world', 'empathize', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'condone', 'actions', 'ethical', 'intellectual', 'level', 'beauty', 'Terry', 'George', 'screenplay', 'judge', 'characters', 'are', 'heroes', 'villains', 'here', 'just', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'individuals', 'doing', 'things', 'fear', 'confusion', 'instinct', 'self-preservation', 'understandable', 'craving', 'eye-for-an-eye', 'justice', 'would', 'never', 'even', 'dream', 'doing', 'ordinary', 'circumstances', 'when', 'Fates', 'suddenly', 'one', 'blow', 'unforeseen', 'devastating', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'vulnerable', 'truly', 'are', 'having', 'lives', 'forever', 'shattered', 'blink', 'eye', 'bets', 'are', 'often', 'Herculean', 'act', 'will', 'lead', 'one', 'back', 'instinctive', 'moral', 'center', 'existed', 'tragedy', 'what', 'Ethan', 'Dwight', 'are', 'ultimately', 'forced', 'learn', 'experience.The', 'plotting', 'taut', 'bit', 'overly', 'reliant', 'coincidence', 'times', 'direction', 'George', 'sensitive', 'focused', 'Ruffalo', 'Phoenix', 'deliver', 'performances', 'such', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'lacerating', 'truthfulness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'were', ""n't"", 'officially', 'awarded', 'efforts.But', 'watching', 'film', ""'re"", 'reward', 'enough', 'viewer']",N/A

1120208,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000YKI4FY,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[1, 1]","From the director of the brilliantHotel Rwandacomes a middle class nightmare that is acted with great restraint and respect for its topic.The story focuses on a hit and run accident that leaves a child dead and two sets of parents facing loss and grief.  This storyline isn't new by any means and Eastwood'sMystic Riverand Redford'sOrdinary Peopleare the best examples I can think of that deal with parents facing a great loss and a slew of terrible films on the Lifetime Channel also come to mind.  This one is unique in that we are let into the mind of the offender to understand his reluctance to come forward.  We also see, all too briefly, the excess use of the internet and how it can infiltrate any average home, let alone one filled with grief as the father who lost his son in this film would rather seek solace online than connect with his own wife who feels shut out.The acting is first rate by Joaquin Phoenix and Jennifer Connelly as the grieving parents as well as by Mark Ruffalo as the hit and run driver.  In addition, the direction is unobtrusive and the storyline compelling, but the film does falter a bit in that it is overly long and rather predictable.  There are also several plot contrivances that are extremely hard to swallow in this film.This film is not for the impatient as it is slow moving, the cold-hearted who think we should just ""move on"" when a tragedy befalls us as the film focuses on people who can't just move on and MUST have closure, or those unable to view things from another's perspective, no matter how ugly that viewpoint may be as much of this film focuses on the parent who did the hit and run and the pain of guilt he feels.  I had great sympathy for all in the situation involved in this film and while, I think, the director and writer did a good job getting us to see the side of the father who did the hit and run, one can't help but to say, ""If he had just stopped . . .""  All the reasons and excuses in the world should never stop us from doing the right human thing, but this film does carefully explore how we can go against our better instincts, and the heavy price we pay for doing so.I can't recall who said the following quote, but it is perfect for this film: ""There are no harder words in tongue or pen, except for these, it might have been.""  Had the hit and run driver just stopped, things might have had a better, if still tragic, resolution.",4,"Few reservations regarding ""Reservation Road""",1218844800,"08 16, 2008",2008,2410,"['director', 'brilliantHotel', 'middle', 'class', 'nightmare', 'acted', 'great', 'restraint', 'respect', 'topic.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'hit', 'run', 'accident', 'child', 'dead', 'two', 'sets', 'parents', 'facing', 'loss', 'grief', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'new', 'means', ""Eastwood'sMystic"", 'Riverand', ""Redford'sOrdinary"", 'Peopleare', 'best', 'examples', 'can', 'think', 'deal', 'parents', 'facing', 'great', 'loss', 'slew', 'terrible', 'films', 'Lifetime', 'Channel', 'also', 'come', 'mind', 'one', 'unique', 'are', 'let', 'mind', 'offender', 'understand', 'reluctance', 'come', 'forward', 'also', 'see', 'too', 'briefly', 'excess', 'use', 'internet', 'how', 'can', 'infiltrate', 'average', 'home', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'filled', 'grief', 'father', 'who', 'lost', 'son', 'film', 'would', 'rather', 'seek', 'solace', 'online', 'connect', 'own', 'wife', 'who', 'shut', 'out.The', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'grieving', 'parents', 'as', 'well', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'hit', 'run', 'driver', 'addition', 'direction', 'unobtrusive', 'storyline', 'compelling', 'film', 'falter', 'bit', 'overly', 'long', 'rather', 'predictable', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'are', 'extremely', 'hard', 'swallow', 'film.This', 'film', 'not', 'impatient', 'slow', 'moving', 'cold-hearted', 'who', 'think', 'should', 'just', 'move', 'when', 'tragedy', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'move', 'MUST', 'have', 'closure', 'unable', 'view', 'things', 'perspective', 'matter', 'how', 'ugly', 'viewpoint', 'may', 'be', 'much', 'film', 'parent', 'who', 'did', 'hit', 'run', 'pain', 'guilt', 'had', 'great', 'sympathy', 'situation', 'involved', 'film', 'think', 'director', 'writer', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'getting', 'see', 'side', 'father', 'who', 'did', 'hit', 'run', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'say', 'had', 'just', 'stopped', 'reasons', 'excuses', 'world', 'should', 'never', 'stop', 'doing', 'right', 'human', 'thing', 'film', 'carefully', 'explore', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'better', 'instincts', 'heavy', 'price', 'pay', 'doing', 'so.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'who', 'said', 'following', 'quote', 'perfect', 'film', 'are', 'harder', 'words', 'tongue', 'pen', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Had', 'hit', 'run', 'driver', 'just', 'stopped', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'still', 'tragic', 'resolution']",N/A
