Here's what I found out about it...""The Golden Palace"" is an American sitcom that originally aired on CBS from September 18, 1992, to May 14, 1993. It starred Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty reprising their ""Golden Girls"" roles.When Bea Arthur decided after seven years of playing Dorothy Zbornak was enough, NBC cancelled the sitcom after seven seasons and 180 episodes in the Nielsen Top 25. The following 1992/93 television season, CBS picked up a spin-off of the series hoping to bring the same success. CBS used The Golden Palace as one of four comedies assembled on Friday night in an effort to combat ABC's TGIF comedy block; ""The Golden Palace"" was grouped with ""Major Dad"", ""Designing Women"", and ""Bob"", all of which were either successful comedies prior to the move or, in the case of ""Bob"", featured a previously successful sitcom star (Bob Newhart).""The Golden Palace"" achieved mixed reviews and premiered with high ratings; ranking 16th for its premiere week. Without Dorothy, however, CBS retooled the series to be slightly different to fit the other three ladies.PLOT""The Golden Palace"" begins where ""The Golden Girls"" left off, in the quartet's now-sold Miami house. With Dorothy Zbornak having married and left in the previous series finale, the three remaining cast members (Sophia Petrillo, Rose Nylund and Blanche Devereaux) decide to invest in a Miami hotel that is up for sale. The hotel, however, is revealed to have been stripped of all of its personnel in an effort to appear more profitable, leaving only two employees: Roland Wilson, the hotel's manager, and Chuy Castillos, the hotel's chef. This requires the women to perform all the tasks of the hotel's staff.The series focused on the interactions between guests at the hotel and the hotel's staff, as well as between the Golden Girls and the previous hotel staff. Guest stars were frequent, including recurring characters that had previously appeared on ""The Golden Girls"" and other celebrities (Bea Arthur reprised the Dorothy Zbornak role for a two-part storyline in which she visits the hotel to check up on her mother).The series ended without a proper series finale. However, it is eventually revealed that following the events of the series, Sophia moves into the Shady Pines retirement home and becomes a cast member on ""Empty Nest"" for the remainder of that series' run. What became of Rose, Blanche and the hotel is left unresolved.By the spring of 1993, ""Golden Palace"" ranked 58th (with a 9.90 rating). Thouugh this was still good enough (by 1990s standards) for a second season renewal, CBS opted to cancel the series. Reruns aired on Lifetime in the mid-2000s, rotating as a ""final season"" of ""The Golden Girls"". The current USA holders of Golden Girls rerun rights, Hallmark Channel and WE TV, do not include the series in rotation.****So to complete my review, I think this series should be released... Why? Fans of these ladies have all seven seasons of ""The Golden Girls"" and want this to complete their collection. And why wouldn't a network/DVD company release it to make money? Hello, do you copy networks? I think this series should have been released as the ""Eighth (and final) Season of 'The Golden Girls'"" when the complete series was released.PLEASE, OH, PLEASE RELEASE THIS ON DVD FOR WE THE FANS TO ADD (AND COMPLETE) OUR COLLECTION!!!!!!",4,"Bring to us the final piece of ""The Golden"" franchise....
