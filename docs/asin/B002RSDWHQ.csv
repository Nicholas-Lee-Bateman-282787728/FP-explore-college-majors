Alvi,"[1, 1]","After watchingThe Beyonce Experience Live [Blu-ray] a couple of months ago, I became a huge fan of Beyonce, in fact so much so that I was afraid to watch this DVD, for fear that it would be a disappointing anti-climax.  I'm relieved and delighted to report that my fears were unfounded, and Beyonce has delivered yet again!I'm now thoroughly convinced that Beyonce is a complete performing artist: a natural beauty (luck of the genes, plus great styling doesn't hurt), a vocalist as good as anyone out there, a dancer strong enough to keep up with her professional dancers, an innovative songwriter with a surprisingly diverse range, an effective team builder and leader, and a visionary with the imagination and creativity needed to put all of the pieces together in a way that results in harmonious synergy.Focusing on this performance in particular, the first half consists mostly of vulnerable ballads which really showcase Beyonce's sublime vocal ability.  In the second half, she gives us a chronological medley of many of her up-tempo hits, accompanied by comments about the genesis of the songs, so that we effectively get a capsule autobiography.  All of this contributes to successfully delivering the intimate performance Beyonce was aiming for.And please don't forget to watch the DVD bonus material which describes the concept beyond this performance and the preparation that went into it.  It confirms what you may have already inferred:  Beyonce knows in detail what she wants to achieve artistically, she works extremely hard to achieve it, and she expects her team to commit to a similar level of effort.If you want to experience one of the great performing artists of our time, don't miss this DVD.  What a privelege it would be to see Beyonce perform live or, better yet, to meet her in person!",5,"A complete artist, a superb and inspiring performance",1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,1813,"['watchingThe', 'Beyonce', 'Experience', 'Live', '[', 'Blu-ray', 'couple', 'months', 'became', 'huge', 'fan', 'Beyonce', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'afraid', 'watch', 'DVD', 'fear', 'would', 'be', 'disappointing', 'anti-climax', ""'m"", 'relieved', 'delighted', 'report', 'fears', 'were', 'unfounded', 'Beyonce', 'delivered', 'yet', 'again', ""'m"", 'now', 'thoroughly', 'convinced', 'Beyonce', 'complete', 'performing', 'artist', 'natural', 'beauty', 'luck', 'genes', 'great', 'styling', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'vocalist', 'as', 'good', 'anyone', 'there', 'dancer', 'strong', 'enough', 'keep', 'up', 'professional', 'dancers', 'innovative', 'songwriter', 'surprisingly', 'diverse', 'range', 'effective', 'team', 'builder', 'leader', 'visionary', 'imagination', 'creativity', 'needed', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'way', 'results', 'harmonious', 'synergy.Focusing', 'performance', 'particular', 'first', 'half', 'mostly', 'vulnerable', 'ballads', 'really', 'showcase', 'Beyonce', 'sublime', 'vocal', 'ability', 'second', 'half', 'chronological', 'medley', 'many', 'up-tempo', 'hits', 'accompanied', 'comments', 'genesis', 'songs', 'effectively', 'get', 'capsule', 'autobiography', 'successfully', 'delivering', 'intimate', 'performance', 'Beyonce', 'was', 'aiming', 'for.And', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'watch', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'material', 'concept', 'performance', 'preparation', 'went', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'already', 'inferred', 'Beyonce', 'detail', 'what', 'achieve', 'artistically', 'extremely', 'hard', 'achieve', 'team', 'commit', 'similar', 'level', 'effort.If', 'want', 'experience', 'one', 'great', 'performing', 'artists', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'DVD', 'What', 'privelege', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'Beyonce', 'perform', 'live', 'better', 'yet', 'meet', 'person']",N/A
