438546,A2Z3N76DDANP32,6304879482,Adrienne Munich,"[0, 0]","This isn't the first interpretation of Henry James's novel.  The Heiress is rightly praised, and there may be others.  However, the sets and the acting in this production makes it spectacular and moving.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is touching and needy, her lonely situation  particularly poignant.  Maggie Smith, Albert Finney, Ben Chaplin, Judith Ivey--the entire cast--is pure gold.  Washington Square itself becomes a main character, and a complex one, it is.  I recommend this brutal movie about upper-middle class American life in nineteenth-century New York.  It is particularly moving about a pampered yet abused child, comparable in its different way to Now Voyager with Bette Davis as the abused daughter of a monstrous mother rather than a cruel, cold father in this film, played by Albert Finney. I recommend watching to those who've read the novel, seen The Heiress and Now Voyager, but also to those who like films about earlier times and those who like films about children trying to grow up and be loved in any country, any century.",5,Henry James's Washington Square,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,1043,"[""n't"", 'first', 'interpretation', 'Henry', 'James', 'novel', 'Heiress', 'rightly', 'praised', 'may', 'be', 'others', 'However', 'sets', 'acting', 'production', 'spectacular', 'moving', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'touching', 'needy', 'lonely', 'situation', 'particularly', 'poignant', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'entire', 'cast', 'pure', 'gold', 'Washington', 'Square', 'main', 'character', 'complex', 'one', 'recommend', 'brutal', 'movie', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'American', 'life', 'nineteenth-century', 'New', 'York', 'particularly', 'moving', 'pampered', 'yet', 'abused', 'child', 'comparable', 'different', 'way', 'Now', 'Voyager', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'abused', 'daughter', 'monstrous', 'mother', 'rather', 'cruel', 'cold', 'father', 'film', 'played', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'recommend', 'watching', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'novel', 'seen', 'Heiress', 'Now', 'Voyager', 'also', 'who', 'films', 'earlier', 'times', 'who', 'films', 'children', 'trying', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'loved', 'country', 'century']",Washington Square VHS

Masion ""history lover and realist""","[9, 11]","Any filmmaker taking on a James adaptation MUST make casting his primary concern since all of James' works are character driven.  This film was partially successful.Jennifer Jason-Leigh's interpretation of Catherin Sloper was interesting to me but I found the characterisation taken to jarring extremes.  Another review declared at times she appeared so socially backward as to be retarded and I agree with him.  Thus it was more jarring to see her one moment squirming and tongue-tied before Townsend, the next moment smoothly inviting him to play piano at her home.  I try to refrain from age-attacking actresses but I do feel she was a little too old for the role as well.Ben Chaplin is gorgeous but I found Townsend unsympathetic in the film.  Townsend's character is supposed to retain a certain sympathy and he just couldn't do it.Finney and Smith were both wonderful in their roles.  Finney's vindictive unforgiving parenting of Catherine is very true in my mind.  He is brutal, at times violently indifferent, yet it is apparent at times he is reaching for some common thread of understanding with the daughter he resents and despises.  His ultimate hypocrisy also sets Catherine free of any more fortun-hunting prospects as well as depriving the Slope dynasty of any hope of continuation.  He is just self-destructive enough to do it and be believable.The costumes and production values of this film were beautiful but the cinematography was just plain weird at moments, with strange camera angles, and the soundtrack is very nice.In comparison to ""The Heiress"" (starring Olivia de Haviland) I think ""Washington Square offered certain pros and cons.  I preferred WS's faithfulness to the story, which presents a more quiet triumph on Catherine's part as opposed to TH's more dramatic resolution.  I DO feel deHaviland is much more believable in the starring role.  At the same time, I liked WS because I felt it was just more Jamesian.

Maybe it was because I could relate to the characters on a personal level because of circumstances in my own life, but I thought this film was exceptionally moving. The scene that sticks out in my mind (or rather, in my heart,) is where Catherine is chasing after the carriage, screaming for Morris to come back, and he never even turns around and looks at her. She's humiliated, emotionally crushed, and he can't even spare her a moment's glance.I have read the book as well, and this is a rare instance in which I like the movie better. In the book, there's no question about Morris' mercenary motives and he really cares nothing for Catherine; in the movie, the viewer is never quite sure if he's sincere or not. I like being kept guessing on that aspect of the plot! I also liked it that Catherine had grown strong enough to refuse him at the end, because I wasn't too sure that she wouldn't take him back.

438556,A3TSLD2UOQRA05,6304879482,"Earl A. Myers, Jr.","[1, 1]","I am reviewing this film from a very narrow perpective. After seeing this film on television, I came to realize that the setting of a scene - where father and daughter ( Finney and Leigh ) are visiting Paris in hopes the the latter will forsake her mercenary lover - was shot in Baltimore, MD. Having lived there for 60 years, I noticed that the backdrop for the celebratory Paris scene was actually the Washington Monument which is located on Charles St. in downtown Baltimore ( Peabody Circle ). This locale was also the setting for another Hollywood movie, "" Bedroom Window "". This leads me to believe that perhaps the entire production of ""Washington Square"" was filmed in Baltimore, since the row homes where the Slopers lived is very similar to Bolton Hills ( an exclusive neighborhood in Baltimore).Additionally, the father to Jennifer Garner, who played the newly married relative of Catherine, was acted by Arthur Laupus, a well-known local Baltimorean noted for his numerous dinner theater portrayals. I would note that Arthur ( Otts ) was my roommate our freshman year at Towson State Teachers College and we recently renewed our acquaintence at our 50th class reunion.My purpose for relaying this information is bring to light the setting of this excellent film. The acting is uniformly sterling. This was unquestionably James' finest work and the film does it more that justice.

438557,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6304879482,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","WASHINGTON SQUARE (dir. Agnieszka Holland, 1997, 115 minutes) is a story/film with which I wasn't familiar. I know nothing of Henry James, who wrote the original novel (Washington Square (Oxford World's Classics)). The movie looked too good to miss, and recently I managed to watch it.What little I learned about James, indirectly from this film, is that it all reminded me a lot of Nathaniel Hawthorne's work; it is no surprise that Hawthorne was James' hero. James himself was an American-born English writer of the mid- to late-19th century.WASHINGTON SQUARE is centered around old Dr. Sloper (Albert Finney), his goofy widowed sister Lavinia (Dame Maggie Smith), his mentally retarded daughter Catherine (a dreadful Jennifer Jason Leigh) and the weird young man who comes a-courtin', distant cousin Matthew Townsend (the repulsive Ben Chaplin).The good doctor is an odious, arrogant man who hates his daughter; he blames her for her mother's death (the mother dies after giving birth). While Catherine is devoted to the crusty old doctor, he seems devoted to making her life a living hell. He merely tolerates her and becomes expectant of her slavish, childish attention to him.Suddenly there appears Matthew, the proverbial and literal ""poor cousin"" suddenly chasing after Catherine, with heavy designs on her. They will be designs Catherine can hardly comprehend. While the nasty old doc absolutely despises young Matthew and rejects him, it seems the whole clan is itching for Matthew and Catherine to marry.Is Matthew after her only for the money? Is that the reason Matthew is more obsessed with the old doc than he is with Catherine? Stay tuned! I found this movie to be strange, tense, disturbing and of very low quality. Perhaps that is Henry James' fault ultimately, but I have a feeling it is not.Though the film is visually rich and true to the era, it is a wicked waste as is the fine talent on offer. Albert Finney never looked so lost or hollow as he does here. Jennifer Leigh as I said is absolutely awful; I'm no good judge of Ben Chaplin because I find him so revolting and unpleasant.Dame Maggie of course does great, brilliant justice to her role. Another painful example of a wicked waste. While this film may or may not have conveyed some of James' original intentions, this depressing film is utterly loveless (except for the love radiating from poor, simple Catherine). It is lackluster and predictable, with no good use of soundtrack, cinematography or anything. As I say, a wicked waste.Director Agnieszka Holland is best known for the equally wasteful, depressingTotal Eclipse.

However, she imbues the characters she plays with real lives of their own, and I figure that is how she does it. She does not have a personality of her own, so she adopts the personalities of her characters and really makes a life for each of them. She is a superb actress in all of her roles, virtually disappearing in all of the roles. And she is no different in Washington Square, playing a dim-witted, none too attractive woman who stands to inherit her father's fortune when he dies. Her father (a lovely Albert Finney) disapproves of the relationship she begins with a man who appears to really love her for who she is. (This character is played convincingly enough, although stiffly, by Ben Chaplin). Indeed the story is an unhappy one based on a Henry James novel. Finney had been worried all along that Chaplin was only interested in his daughter for the money she stood to inherit, and it appears that Chaplin has pure intentions, but when it comes right down to it, he is greedy and wants her for her money. She ends up alone and does not inherit anything from her father (she has a modest inheritance from her mother's estate). Chaplin comes to visit her after many years apart, and she tells him simply never to return.

The musical score is in the capable hands of Jan AP Kaczmarek and the Director of Photography is Jerzy Zielinski, and with all these elements in place, the last ingredient in making this a successful adaptation of a Henry James novel is the cast.Fortunately the assembled cast matches the above credentials.  Albert Finney is superb as the wealthy Dr. Austin Sloper who hoards his money in his mansion on Washington Square and whose overprotective rule of his less than attractive daughter Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) - who is also under the influence of her overbearing Aunt Lavinia (Maggie Smith, still chewing the scenery as usual but convincing) - has put an impasse to Catherine's infatuation with the handsome but poor Morris Townsend (Ben Chaplin): if Catherine should choose to marry Morris she would be cut off as his heiress.  James' models of womanhood are played well by Jennifer Garner as the niece that marries and breeds and her mother Aunt Elizabeth (Judith Ivey, currently wowing audiences in a revival of 'The Glass Menagerie').  Distance, imposed by the disapproving Dr. Sloper in escorting Catherine to Europe for a year, doesn't appear to squelch the passion between Catherine and Morris, but Morris finds work which takes him away from the returned Catherine, only to learn upon return that Catherine will not inherit her father's fortune - a glitch that sadly changes the relationship of what had appeared to be a true love romance.  In the end the film follows Henry James' view of the world of his time - a palette for social criticism. Made in 1997, this film holds up very well indeed.

438563,A3TPSEI5YZO777,6304879482,Jane Beckwith,"[7, 7]","I saw this movie about five years ago and liked it, but was a bit disappointed in the ending.  I'm a big fan of movies based on books by Jane Austen, so I'm used to everything working out in the end.  Recently I viewed ""Washington Square"" a second time and found it extremely compelling and thought provoking (as well as being entertaining).  Catherine and Morris are complex characters and you never really know exactly what they are thinking or what their motivations truly are.  I think Morris wanted Catherine's money, but I'm not convinced that he was simply a fortune hunter.  I think he felt like he and Catherine could make each other reasonably happy and he wouldn't have to toil for his living, which he seemed to think was beneath him.  After the trip abroad, why did Catherine refuse to ask her father again for his consent as Morris obviously wanted her to?  She was willing to risk losing Morris in order not to beg of her father.  Perhaps she knew it was pointless, but it seemed to me that she just flat out refused to even try.  When Morris says ""Yes, I wanted you and I wanted your money, is that so horrible?"", I found myself sympathizing with him--was it so horrible to want both?  After all, he doesn't say ""I never wanted you, I only wanted the money."" At one point the married aunt says something to the father along the lines of ""you've worked all your life for your fortune, can you not give it to Catherine and allow her to have it in a happy state.""  But the father isn't willing to do that--I don't think simply because he views Morris as a fortune hunter, but also because he harbors deep resentment and refuses to see Catherine happy when he was denied happiness due to his wife dying in childbirth.  It's wonderful to watch a movie where the main character evolves and that happens with Catherine in this film.  She is a much changed person in a span of eight to ten years.  Another viewer may read this review and feel very differently about the happenings of the story.  That is what is so compelling about this film--it forces you to think and it certainly makes you feel.",5,It will make you think,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,2106,"['saw', 'movie', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'liked', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'ending', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'Jane', 'Austen', ""'m"", 'used', 'everything', 'working', 'out', 'end', 'Recently', 'viewed', 'Washington', 'Square', 'second', 'time', 'found', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'thought', 'provoking', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'entertaining', 'Catherine', 'Morris', 'are', 'complex', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'what', 'motivations', 'truly', 'are', 'think', 'Morris', 'wanted', 'Catherine', 'money', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'was', 'simply', 'fortune', 'hunter', 'think', 'felt', 'Catherine', 'could', 'make', 'other', 'reasonably', 'happy', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'toil', 'living', 'seemed', 'think', 'was', 'trip', 'abroad', 'why', 'did', 'Catherine', 'refuse', 'ask', 'father', 'again', 'consent', 'Morris', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'was', 'willing', 'risk', 'losing', 'Morris', 'order', 'not', 'beg', 'father', 'Perhaps', 'knew', 'was', 'pointless', 'seemed', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'refused', 'even', 'try', 'When', 'Morris', 'Yes', 'wanted', 'wanted', 'money', 'so', 'horrible', 'found', 'sympathizing', 'was', 'so', 'horrible', 'want', ""n't"", 'say', 'never', 'wanted', 'only', 'wanted', 'money', 'one', 'point', 'married', 'aunt', 'something', 'father', 'lines', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'life', 'fortune', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'Catherine', 'allow', 'have', 'happy', 'state', 'father', ""n't"", 'willing', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'simply', 'Morris', 'fortune', 'hunter', 'also', 'deep', 'resentment', 'see', 'Catherine', 'happy', 'when', 'was', 'denied', 'happiness', 'due', 'wife', 'dying', 'childbirth', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'movie', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'evolves', 'Catherine', 'film', 'much', 'changed', 'person', 'span', 'eight', 'ten', 'years', 'viewer', 'may', 'read', 'review', 'feel', 'very', 'differently', 'happenings', 'story', 'what', 'so', 'compelling', 'film', 'think', 'certainly', 'feel']",Washington Square VHS
438564,A37NODCIL8PP75,6304879482,"Jeannette Belliveau ""Author, Writer, Editor, ...","[1, 2]","In ""Washington Square,"" Henry James examines the fascinating dynamic of what a handsome, worldly but penniless man might see in a plain rich woman. Henry James, like E.M. Forster, is fascinated with attempts of couples to break out of predictable pairings based on social class and color.At first the relationship between Catherine Sloper, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Morris Townsend, played by Ben Chaplin, seems sincere and of the theme ""love will prevail.""Catherine's controlling father, played by Albert Finney, proves obstinately against their union, and the viewer must decide whether he was right in his assessment of Morris or whether he engineered Morris's eventual cynicism by forcing the lovers into a year apart. The role of Catherine's widowed aunt, Maggie Smith, is implied but not explicit in souring the relationship and could have used a sharper explanation in the screenplay.At the end the viewer must judge whether Catherine enjoys a real or Pyrrhic victory over her father and Morris, or merely goes into some sort of Zen, above-the-fray state of mind.Tidbit: ""Washington Square"" was filmed around Baltimore's Union Square, standing in for New York and Paris as well.

Larcade,"[1, 1]","I'm going to go ahead and compare it to the older movie I thought it was a remake of, since I've seen that done so much at other customer-review sites. Everywhere online, I see Ben Chaplin sneered at as being ""no Montgomery Clift"" and a pathetic ""substitute."" Narrow, self-limiting, empty-skulled admissions of never having heard of Henry James or realized this movie closely follows THE NOVEL of which ""The Heiress"" was only a loose adaptation. How pointless to all look at each other and sniff in unison that this beautiful, talented actor compares poorly to Montgomery Clift. For one thing, he doesn't! Ben Chaplin is wonderful as Morris Townsend.I don't read Henry James, don't care for him, and didn't know ""Washington Square"" had been a novel. I wanted and expected from the movie a remake of ""The Heiress,"" and was disappointed enough to throw my hair-scrunchie at the TV when it ended. But compare the two endings: ""Catherine..!"" Morris pounding with his fists on the locked door. ""Catherine!"" Frantic pounding increases. ""Catherine! Catherine!!!"" to ""I don't hate you, Morris, but please don't ever come here again.""For the broader audience, ""Washington Square"" is a dud that could only work as a movie if ""The Heiress"" hadn't preceded it. Or on thinking twice, I guess without The Heiress to precede it--without the shorter, punchier, more obvious adaptation gotten out of the way--the dull but faithful ""Washington Square"" wouldn't have been made at all.I didn't like Aunt Lavinia in this movie. Realistic though she probably was, I thought she was just too repulsive, more tolerable and interesting in ""The Heiress"". Albert Finney was as good as Ralph Richardson, in other words fantastically great. I love Jennifer Jason Leigh, but thought her Catherine came across as too ugly. It was distracting, that sallow skin, those small yellow teeth, knowing how lovely she really is.

438568,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,6304879482,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[2, 3]","Darwinism, selective adaptation, rationalism, a stone cold universe--these are the main characters in the film adaptation of Henry James' novel ""Washington Square."" I wept for the futility of the motives of the players.  Forlorn-ness, weariness, desperation--these are feelings Henry James (author) passed out with plenitude to both Morris and Catherine, the exquisitely needy main characters.Catherine, an only child, who lives at Washington Square, under the strict supervision of her doctor-father, is the most emotionally deplete character to begin. Played with utmost perfection, with downward stares, gazes from under obedient eyes, a shrinking of body in the presence of men, Jennifer Jason-Leigh lived that character. So does Chaplin with Morris with perfect beauty, necessary emotional repertoire and glib talent with tongue and ready story. He is as extraordinarily handsome as she is plain. Yet, by steady and intense tender attention, he brings out a Catherine no one has ever seen, least of all her domineering father.This is a story of want meeting need, with each discovering in the other the answer to each dilemma, with one (Morris) knowing what is needed, the other (Catherine) just feeling what is wanted. They meet at an engagement party (so ripe a setting for possibility). It is amazing to watch Chaplin see Catherine and fall instantly in love with her. Or is it a game? Her father, the wealthy doctor, thinks so and discourages her at every turn. Personally, I watched carefully for any slippage in his facial control to detect a false face or mocking smile. But never. He seemed genuinely to care. On the other hand Catherine refuses--initially-- to accept or believe his intentions. Her father has well-trained her to believe she is stupid and plain and desired by men only for her future fortune.At the beginning when I spoke of despair and weariness, I mentioned these in accordance with the scientific and philosophic views of the day: the cold indifference of the universe, the non-involvement of the religious with daily life, almost a cold, calculating universe in its own way.There is in some religious circles today the belief that prayer not only changes the one prayed for, but the one doing the praying. Although an anachronism, surely the context is the same: Morris does fall in love with this poor creature he is wooing. That is my impression. Of course, she loses herself passionately.That's all I need say about the film. For sure, it is a powerful drama that unfolds before one's eyes and, for sure, the ending is both expected and incredibly sad. Yes, how can we ever push ego into the bushes and seize the moment and take a chance? Why are we so stubborn? Can there occur a merging  between these two? What would it take? Everything? Nothing? Can we go too far past a certain point? Oh, I could keep asking these questions, but the answer remains the same: It is what James made it to be. His book reflects the values not only of his day, but our day as well. The story could go differently today, but should it? Can there be too much in a relationship to return to its purer moments?",5,"Happiness is where we find it--snd heartache, pain, disappointment, and on and on",1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,3129,"['Darwinism', 'selective', 'adaptation', 'rationalism', 'stone', 'cold', 'universe', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Henry', 'James', 'novel', 'Washington', 'Square', 'wept', 'futility', 'motives', 'players', 'Forlorn-ness', 'weariness', 'desperation', 'are', 'feelings', 'Henry', 'James', 'author', 'passed', 'out', 'plenitude', 'Morris', 'Catherine', 'exquisitely', 'needy', 'main', 'characters.Catherine', 'only', 'child', 'who', 'Washington', 'Square', 'strict', 'supervision', 'doctor-father', 'most', 'emotionally', 'deplete', 'character', 'begin', 'Played', 'utmost', 'perfection', 'downward', 'stares', 'gazes', 'obedient', 'eyes', 'shrinking', 'body', 'presence', 'men', 'Jennifer', 'Jason-Leigh', 'lived', 'character', 'So', 'Chaplin', 'Morris', 'perfect', 'beauty', 'necessary', 'emotional', 'repertoire', 'glib', 'talent', 'tongue', 'ready', 'story', 'extraordinarily', 'handsome', 'plain', 'steady', 'intense', 'tender', 'attention', 'out', 'Catherine', 'one', 'ever', 'seen', 'least', 'domineering', 'father.This', 'story', 'want', 'meeting', 'need', 'discovering', 'other', 'answer', 'dilemma', 'one', 'Morris', 'knowing', 'what', 'needed', 'other', 'Catherine', 'just', 'feeling', 'what', 'wanted', 'meet', 'engagement', 'party', 'so', 'ripe', 'setting', 'possibility', 'amazing', 'watch', 'Chaplin', 'see', 'Catherine', 'fall', 'instantly', 'love', 'game', 'father', 'wealthy', 'doctor', 'so', 'turn', 'Personally', 'watched', 'carefully', 'slippage', 'facial', 'control', 'detect', 'false', 'face', 'mocking', 'smile', 'never', 'seemed', 'genuinely', 'care', 'other', 'hand', 'Catherine', 'initially', 'accept', 'believe', 'intentions', 'father', 'well-trained', 'believe', 'stupid', 'plain', 'desired', 'men', 'only', 'future', 'beginning', 'when', 'spoke', 'despair', 'weariness', 'mentioned', 'accordance', 'scientific', 'philosophic', 'views', 'day', 'cold', 'indifference', 'universe', 'non-involvement', 'religious', 'daily', 'life', 'almost', 'cold', 'calculating', 'universe', 'own', 'way.There', 'religious', 'circles', 'today', 'belief', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'prayed', 'one', 'doing', 'praying', 'anachronism', 'surely', 'context', 'same', 'Morris', 'fall', 'love', 'poor', 'creature', 'wooing', 'impression', 'course', 'passionately.That', 'need', 'say', 'film', 'sure', 'powerful', 'drama', 'one', 'eyes', 'sure', 'ending', 'expected', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'Yes', 'how', 'can', 'ever', 'push', 'ego', 'bushes', 'seize', 'moment', 'take', 'chance', 'Why', 'are', 'so', 'stubborn', 'Can', 'occur', 'merging', 'two', 'What', 'would', 'take', 'Everything', 'Nothing', 'Can', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'certain', 'point', 'Oh', 'could', 'keep', 'asking', 'questions', 'answer', 'same', 'what', 'James', 'made', 'be', 'book', 'values', 'not', 'only', 'day', 'day', 'well', 'story', 'could', 'go', 'differently', 'today', 'should', 'Can', 'there', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'relationship', 'return', 'purer', 'moments']",Washington Square VHS

438570,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6304879482,Lawyeraau,"[29, 36]","Washington Square is an engaging period piece, with wonderful performances to be had by Albert Finney, Maggie Smith, and Ben Chaplin. The only jarring note here is the performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh, who lacks subtlety and is so heavy handed as to be distracting.This movie closely follows Henry James' novel of the same name.  Albert Finney plays a wealthy doctor, Austin Sloper, whose wife died giving birth to their daughter, Katherine, an only child raised by the imposing Doctor Sloper with the assistance of the Katherine's maternal, but silly and vapid Aunt Lavinia, beautifully played by Maggie Smith.Katherine, a shy and clumsy child, desperately wanting, but lacking, affection from her imperious and distant father, grows up to be a plain faced, graceless, and awkward, young woman. As played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, she is a caricature rather than a fully fleshed character. Her portrayal of Katherine shows her lack of skill as an actress, especially when compared to the finely nuanced performances given by the other actors.When this clumsy, plain jane is wooed by the dashing, but penniless young hunk, Morris Townsend, she falls hard and wants desperately to marry him. Silly Aunt Lavinia encourages the romance and aids and abets the lovers, curiously fulfilling her own romantic fantasies, while assisting her niece in fulfilling hers. Her father, however, pegs the handsome Mr. Townsend as a fortune hunter, because, he reasons, why else would Mr. Townsend want to marry his graceless lump of a daughter?Needless to say, what follows is the cat and mouse game Dr. Sloper and Townsend play with each other, as well as with Katherine. Father threatens to disinherit daughter, and daughter swears she will marry suitor, despite father's threats. Suitor equivocates on the issue of whether disinheritance will cool his affections for Katherine. Does he do so out of love for Katherine or self interest? Suffice to say, while Katherine ends up finally getting some backbone in the end, one must ask who is the the ultimate victor in this drama. In my book, Father wins hands down and has the last laugh from the grave.All in all, this is a handsome and, for the most part, well acted period piece that will be enjoyed by those who love this genre of film.",5,FATHER KNOWS BEST...,981244800,"02 4, 2001",2001,2276,"['Washington', 'Square', 'engaging', 'period', 'piece', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'be', 'had', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'only', 'jarring', 'note', 'here', 'performance', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'who', 'subtlety', 'so', 'heavy', 'handed', 'be', 'distracting.This', 'movie', 'closely', 'Henry', 'James', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'wealthy', 'doctor', 'Austin', 'Sloper', 'wife', 'died', 'giving', 'birth', 'daughter', 'Katherine', 'only', 'child', 'raised', 'imposing', 'Doctor', 'Sloper', 'assistance', 'Katherine', 'maternal', 'silly', 'vapid', 'Aunt', 'Lavinia', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Maggie', 'Smith.Katherine', 'shy', 'clumsy', 'child', 'desperately', 'wanting', 'lacking', 'affection', 'imperious', 'distant', 'father', 'up', 'be', 'plain', 'faced', 'graceless', 'awkward', 'young', 'woman', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'caricature', 'rather', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'character', 'portrayal', 'Katherine', 'lack', 'skill', 'actress', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'given', 'other', 'actors.When', 'clumsy', 'plain', 'jane', 'wooed', 'dashing', 'penniless', 'young', 'hunk', 'Morris', 'Townsend', 'hard', 'desperately', 'marry', 'Silly', 'Aunt', 'Lavinia', 'romance', 'aids', 'lovers', 'curiously', 'fulfilling', 'own', 'romantic', 'fantasies', 'assisting', 'niece', 'fulfilling', 'hers', 'father', 'however', 'handsome', 'Mr.', 'Townsend', 'fortune', 'hunter', 'reasons', 'why', 'else', 'would', 'Mr.', 'Townsend', 'want', 'marry', 'graceless', 'lump', 'daughter', 'Needless', 'say', 'what', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'Dr.', 'Sloper', 'Townsend', 'play', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'Katherine', 'Father', 'disinherit', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'swears', 'will', 'marry', 'suitor', 'father', 'threats', 'Suitor', 'issue', 'disinheritance', 'will', 'cool', 'affections', 'Katherine', 'Does', 'do', 'so', 'love', 'Katherine', 'self', 'interest', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Katherine', 'up', 'finally', 'getting', 'backbone', 'end', 'one', 'must', 'ask', 'who', 'ultimate', 'victor', 'drama', 'book', 'Father', 'hands', 'down', 'last', 'laugh', 'grave.All', 'handsome', 'most', 'part', 'well', 'acted', 'period', 'piece', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'who', 'love', 'genre', 'film']",Washington Square VHS

She almost faints in his presence, so strong is the effect he has on her. He knows what a woman wants to hear.""I never imagined I'd be taken like this...I heard tales of this, this thing.

438584,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,6304879482,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 1]","""Washington Square,"" (1997), is a dramatic romance of a film,  based on Henry James' tragicomic first novel, of that name,Washington Square, which was published in 1880 by the highly regarded, American author.  WASHINGTON SQUARE has proven itself to be one of James' more popular novels, remaining in print for more than a century, until today.  This  film was directed by the Polish  Agnieszka Holland, and starred  Jennifer Jason Leigh,Single White Female, as Catherine Sloper, Albert Finney,(Saturday Night and Sunday Morning), as her father, Dr. Sloper,, and Ben Chaplin,(Two Weeks), as Morris Townsend.  With Maggie Smith,(Downton Abbey: Episode 1 [HD]), as Mrs. Lavinia Penniman, the Doctor's sister.  Veteran theatrical star Judith Ivey,The Addams Family), appears as Mrs. Almond, the doctor's other sister; a young Jennifer Garner,(Ghosts of Girlfriends Past), appears as Marian Almond, Mrs. Almond's eldest daughter who does everything right by Victorian standards, including making an appropriate, ""punctual"" marriage.Dr. Austin Sloper, a rich respected physician, lives in Washington Square, New York, with his only surviving child, Catherine. She is a sweet-natured young woman who greatly disappointments her brilliant domineering father; he thinks her physically plain and dull of personality and intellect. Mind you, Sloper's beloved, beautiful and vivacious wife had died a week after giving birth to Catherine, so it seems obvious that the doctor also holds her mother's death against the young woman.  (The Doctor's three-year-old son had died two years earlier.) Sloper's widowed sister, Lavinia, a foolish woman, is the only other member of the  household.Catherine meets the tall, handsome and charming Morris Townsend at Mrs. Almond's party celebrating her daughter Marian's engagement; she is strongly attracted to him. Morris instantly proceeds to court Catherine; he is aided in this enterprise by Mrs. Penniman, who craves drama.  Dr. Sloper strongly disapproves of the courtship, as he believes Morris to be a fortune-hunter. Thus, when the young couple announces their engagement, the doctor looks into Morris's background.  He visits Mrs. Montgomery, the young man's sister.  Sloper thereby learns that Townsend, who has run through his small inheritance wandering  Europe, has been a parasitic spendthrift to his poor widowed sister and her five children. So the doctor forbids his daughter to marry Townsend, whom he considers to be a 'selfish idler.'  Poor Catherine cannot decide between the loyalty she feels she owes her father, and the devotion she feels for her fianc&eacute;.Dr. Sloper understands Catherine's predicament and even pities her.  But he tells her that he will disinherit her if she marries Morris; then takes her on a far-ranging year's tour of Europe to help her forget her young suitor. During this time, he mentions Catherine's engagement only twice: once while they are alone in the Alps, and again on the eve of their return. On both occasions, Catherine holds firm in her determination to marry. After her second refusal to give up her projected marriage, Sloper angrily compares her to a sheep fattened for slaughter. He has finally gone too far: Catherine sees his contempt, withdraws from him, readies herself to give her love  to Morris.Jennifer Jason Leigh does all right as Catherine, though I've never been a big fan of her super-intense style.  Ben Chaplin does better than you might expect; he's no Montgomery Clift,(who played the part in the 1949 movie)  but he does manage to infuse his fortune-hunter with a certain sense of vulnerability, as did Clift. (Though Clift, of course, did it better.) Albert Finney does well as the  doctor.  Smith, in her role as Lavinia, is that silly woman to the life.  Ivey and Garner are fine in their supporting parts.While this film takes some liberties with the original text, it is  hews more closely to the book than did the much more popular and better-known filmThe Heiress (Universal Cinema Classics), directed by William Wyler, released in 1949.  That earlier  film  memorably starred Olivia De Havilland (an Oscar winner for this), Montgomery Clift, Ralph Richardson and Judith Ivey.  It was  based upon the stage play of the same name, by Ruth and Augustus Goetz, which adapted the novel. That play was originally performed on Broadway in 1947 with Wendy Hiller as Catherine and Basil Rathbone as Dr. Sloper. (It was most recently revived  in 2012. And I managed to see it, starring Jessica Chastain, Dan Stevens, Judith Ivey, and David Strathairn.  What a cast, what a treat!  And hasn't Judith Ivey made a specialty of this entertainment!)  Both the earlier play and movie stuck closely to the novel and took many of the best lines directly from James' dialogue. However, the Goetz version does make a few changes to the story and to the character of Catherine, making her eventually sly enough to plan revenge on Morris, abruptly sending him off.  The Goetz version also had Catherine, in fact, receiving her full inheritance, which makes her revenge on Morris even  sweeter.  And it introduced the two great dramatic bookends of the story, Morris's jilting of Catherine on the way to the altar, and her revenge: neither of these two riveting set pieces is used in the later film.Nor was I pleased with some of the liberties taken by this later film.  It introduces two vulgar scenes, found nowhere in James' novel, or anywhere in that sensitive man's work.  It also introduces a scene of the older spinster Catherine apparently running a day care center in her luxurious Washington Square home.  Now, critics agree that any work of literature or art  that lasts more than a century must allow succeeding generations to read it their way, and this is certainly true of WASHINGTON SQUARE.  The script of this movie tries to present Catherine an early feminist, and, although James certainly didn't see her this way, the material does allow it.  But running a day care center in her home?  The novel was published and set in 1880.  Jane Addams, the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, was a pioneer social worker and founder of Chicago's Hull House.  She was born only in 1860.  So she would have been 20 in 1880, and hardly have had time even to found Hull House, let alone invent daycare centers.Well, I missed the two great dramatic scenes--the sequential mutual jiltings-- from THE HEIRESS, and had negative reactions to the additions made to this script. Can't recommend this film: if you ask me, it deserved to flop. It did.",2,Deserved to Flop,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,6569,"['Washington', 'Square', '1997', 'dramatic', 'romance', 'film', 'based', 'Henry', 'James', 'tragicomic', 'first', 'novel', 'name',

438586,A14HHOT9999Z22,6304879482,"Stephen M. Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[11, 15]","This adaptation, like 1949's *The Heiress*, is based on the Henry James novel. *The Heiress*, starring Olivia de Havilland, remains as a well-respected piece of work, though less true to James' original story than this new remake, which retains James' original title. It is the story of a awkward, yet loving daughter , devoted to her father after her mother dies during childbirth. The arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever, and considers her, as well as all women, simpleminded. When a young man of good family and little fortune comes courting, the Father is naturally suspicious, but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man, is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him. Leigh is a controversial actress - most either love her or hate her - and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style, like she's acting through gritted teeth. She's not bad in this, and she handles her role relatively deftly - it's just an awkward role for any actress, making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses. While the character garners a lot of sympathy, she's not particularly likable. The very handsome and immensely appealing Ben Chaplin (previously seen in *The Truth About Cats and Dogs*) plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune, or is really in love with her. Maggie Smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well-meaning aunt. Finney is marvelous, of course, as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience, but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves. But does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune? This is only one instance where *Washington Square* differs from *The Heiress*. Another instance is the ability to stick with it. It is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet, offering too little story in too long of a movie.",3,Pretty But Dull,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,2117,"['adaptation', '1949', '*The', 'Heiress*', 'based', 'Henry', 'James', 'novel', '*The', 'Heiress*', 'starring', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'well-respected', 'piece', 'work', 'less', 'true', 'James', 'original', 'story', 'new', 'remake', 'James', 'original', 'title', 'story', 'awkward', 'yet', 'loving', 'daughter', 'devoted', 'father', 'mother', 'childbirth', 'arrogant', 'father', 'daughter', 'esteem', 'whatsoever', 'as', 'well', 'women', 'simpleminded', 'When', 'young', 'man', 'good', 'family', 'little', 'fortune', 'courting', 'Father', 'naturally', 'suspicious', 'feeling', 'so', 'sure', 'daughter', 'could', 'hold', 'interest', 'man', 'convinced', 'young', 'man', 'fortune', 'hunter', 'see', 'Leigh', 'controversial', 'actress', 'most', 'love', 'hate', 'always', 'particular', 'edginess', 'tenseness', 'style', 'acting', 'gritted', 'teeth', 'not', 'bad', 'role', 'relatively', 'deftly', 'just', 'awkward', 'role', 'actress', 'making', 'audience', 'want', 'grab', 'character', 'shoulders', 'shake', 'senses', 'character', 'lot', 'sympathy', 'not', 'particularly', 'likable', 'very', 'handsome', 'immensely', 'appealing', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'previously', 'seen', '*The', 'Truth', 'Cats', 'Dogs*', 'role', 'exact', 'amount', 'mystery', 'required', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'fortune', 'really', 'love', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'one', 'finest', 'actresses', 'alive', 'level', 'movie', 'considerably', 'portrayal', 'well-meaning', 'aunt', 'Finney', 'marvelous', 'course', 'father', 'who', 'disinherit', 'daughter', 'disobedience', 'daughter', 'willing', 'risk', 'man', 'ardent', 'suitor', 'still', 'want', 'fortune', 'only', 'one', 'instance', 'where', '*Washington', 'Square*', 'differs', '*The', 'Heiress*', 'instance', 'ability', 'stick', 'handsome', 'movie', 'as', 'tedious', 'dripping', 'faucet', 'offering', 'too', 'little', 'story', 'too', 'long', 'movie']",Washington Square VHS

438590,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,6304879482,Tsuyoshi,"[16, 19]","I waited for the Japanese release of this Henry James adaptation of ""Washinton Square"", but after 5 years I see no news of it.  Now I bought a video of the film, to find the reason why this was neglected in our Japanese market.  Well, though I still don't know why, I think I can somehow understand the distributors' unwillingness to release this one.Because the film is a mixed bag.  Not that ""Washington Square"" is a bad film.  On the contrary, I would rather like to praise it, but with some reservation.  First, remember, the story, based on one of James's earlier works of the same title, is a tragic one.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is Catherine Sloper, whose father (Albert Finney) is a respected doctor in New York City of the early 19th century.  Though Catherine is a good girl (morally, I mean), she is never praised as a beautiful girl, and she knows it, too.  Though her father Dr. Sloper is not cold-hearted, he is emotionally detached from his only daughter while she is desperately seeks for his approval.  Thus their life goes on at Washington Square in New York City.Until a handsome man meets Catherine at a tea party, where he advances to her with a golden smile and skilled conversation.  He is Morris Townsend (Ben Chaplin, ""Lost Souls""), who, it seems, lived a wild life in the past, but now, he says, is back as reformed.  Catherine falls in love for the first time in her life, and he says he is willing to marry her, but her father suspects that this young handsome guy is just a cad, good for nothing and after the money which she is to inherit after his  death.  But is he (doctor) really right in sternly rejecting him and his daughter's wish?The story is melodramatic, but that is not the point.  Director Holland allows the actors to be characters they play, so that they realize the complicated relations which are subtlely described in the original book.  Certainly it is slow-moving, but if you pay attention not to the plot, but to the emotional changes happening in these people, you will enjoy the film.  After all, James is not famous for gripping storytelling; it is his characters and the relations between them that we care, and the film deserves our praise very much for the reason that it brought them to very real thing on screen.But the praise is not unconditional, for there are some questionable decisions made in the film.  Holland rendered the piano recital scene a very embarrassing one (like ""The Exocist""), but that is totally unnecesary (and the original book does not have Catherine humiliated that way).  Casting is also strange.  Jason Leigh, herself very good, is, I am afraid, a bit miscast because Catherine should be, I thought, a little younger.  Ben Chaplin and Albert Finney are good, but Maggie Smith's meddlesome Mrs. Penniman, who gives some comic (but  slightly cruelly depicted) taste, looks uncomfortable.  Probably that is because we see her playing more serious, no-nonsense characters, as she did in ""Secret Garden"" ""Gosford Park"" and others.Though this is not as good as William Wyler's ""The Heiress"", director Holland made a splendid job here.  Some of the camera work is also superb (see the sweeping movement of the opening scene), but sometimes her direction goes too far, as I pointed out.  But as a whole, a very good costume drama.",4,Very Good Adaptation of Henry James's Tragic Story,1040860800,"12 26, 2002",2002,3305,"['waited', 'Japanese', 'release', 'Henry', 'James', 'adaptation', 'Washinton', 'Square', '5', 'years', 'see', 'news', 'Now', 'bought', 'video', 'film', 'find', 'reason', 'why', 'was', 'neglected', 'Japanese', 'market', 'Well', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'think', 'can', 'somehow', 'understand', 'distributors', 'unwillingness', 'release', 'film', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Not', 'Washington', 'Square', 'bad', 'film', 'contrary', 'would', 'rather', 'like', 'praise', 'reservation', 'First', 'remember', 'story', 'based', 'one', 'James', 'earlier', 'works', 'same', 'title', 'tragic', 'one', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Catherine', 'Sloper', 'father', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'respected', 'doctor', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'Catherine', 'good', 'girl', 'morally', 'mean', 'never', 'praised', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'too', 'father', 'Dr.', 'Sloper', 'not', 'cold-hearted', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'only', 'daughter', 'desperately', 'seeks', 'approval', 'Thus', 'life', 'Washington', 'Square', 'New', 'York', 'City.Until', 'handsome', 'man', 'Catherine', 'tea', 'party', 'where', 'golden', 'smile', 'skilled', 'conversation', 'Morris', 'Townsend', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'Lost', 'Souls', 'who', 'lived', 'wild', 'life', 'past', 'now', 'back', 'reformed', 'Catherine', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'willing', 'marry', 'father', 'young', 'handsome', 'guy', 'just', 'cad', 'good', 'nothing', 'money', 'inherit', 'death', 'doctor', 'really', 'right', 'sternly', 'rejecting', 'daughter', 'wish', 'story', 'melodramatic', 'not', 'point', 'Director', 'Holland', 'actors', 'be', 'characters', 'play', 'realize', 'complicated', 'relations', 'are', 'subtlely', 'described', 'original', 'book', 'Certainly', 'slow-moving', 'pay', 'attention', 'not', 'plot', 'emotional', 'changes', 'happening', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'James', 'not', 'famous', 'gripping', 'storytelling', 'characters', 'relations', 'care', 'film', 'praise', 'very', 'much', 'reason', 'brought', 'very', 'real', 'thing', 'praise', 'not', 'unconditional', 'are', 'questionable', 'decisions', 'made', 'film', 'Holland', 'rendered', 'piano', 'recital', 'scene', 'very', 'embarrassing', 'one', 'Exocist', 'totally', 'unnecesary', 'original', 'book', 'not', 'have', 'Catherine', 'humiliated', 'way', 'Casting', 'also', 'strange', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'very', 'good', 'am', 'afraid', 'bit', 'miscast', 'Catherine', 'should', 'be', 'thought', 'little', 'younger', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'are', 'good', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'meddlesome', 'Mrs.', 'Penniman', 'who', 'comic', 'slightly', 'cruelly', 'depicted', 'taste', 'uncomfortable', 'Probably', 'see', 'playing', 'more', 'serious', 'no-nonsense', 'characters', 'did', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'William', 'Wyler', 'Heiress', 'director', 'Holland', 'made', 'splendid', 'job', 'here', 'camera', 'work', 'also', 'superb', 'see', 'sweeping', 'movement', 'opening', 'scene', 'sometimes', 'direction', 'too', 'far', 'pointed', 'out', 'whole', 'very', 'good', 'costume', 'drama']",Washington Square VHS
