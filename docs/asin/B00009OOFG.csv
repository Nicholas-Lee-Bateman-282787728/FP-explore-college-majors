755961,A20HNT8HYIYY0X,B00009OOFG,"Adrian Stranik ""Ade""","[1, 4]","Carla works for a property developer's where she excels in being unattractive, unappreciated and desperate. She is also deaf.Her boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company. Help arrives in the form of Paul, a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environment.An implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and Carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week. When Carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits Paul's criminality by having him steal the contract back. The colleague quickly realises that she's behind the robbery, but when he confronts her, Paul's readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price.Paul is given a `going over' by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt. He formulates a plan which utilises Carla's unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers. It's now Carla's turn to enter a frightening new world.The fourth feature from director Jacques Audiard, `READ MY LIPS' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners. The leads are excellent; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect. Carla's first meeting with Paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was, until very recently, a jailbird. Emmanuelle Devos, who plays Carla, has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame. Vincent Cassel plays Paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he's receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killed.Like many French films, `READ MY LIPS' appears, at first, to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it's probably about everything. The only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of Paul's parole officer; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac.It was the French `New Wave' of the 60's that first introduced the concept of `genre' to film making and I've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it; so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre, or better still, defy it.",4,Genre clash - it's the future,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,2711,"['Carla', 'property', 'developer', 'where', 'being', 'unattractive', 'unappreciated', 'desperate', 'also', 'deaf.Her', 'boss', 'offers', 'hire', 'somebody', 'alleviate', 'heavy', 'workload', 'opportunity', 'secure', 'male', 'company', 'Help', 'form', 'Paul', 'tattooed', 'hoodlum', 'fresh', 'prison', 'clearly', 'unsuited', 'mannered', 'routine', 'office', 'environment.An', 'implicit', 'sexual', 'tension', 'two', 'Carla', 'determined', 'keep', 'reluctance', 'embrace', 'working', 'week', 'When', 'Carla', 'edged', 'important', 'contract', 'was', 'negotiating', 'slimy', 'colleague', 'Paul', 'criminality', 'having', 'steal', 'contract', 'back', 'colleague', 'quickly', 'robbery', 'when', 'Paul', 'readiness', 'punch', 'people', 'face', 'handy', 'too', 'thuggery', 'price.Paul', 'given', 'going', 'mob', 'acquaintances', 'reminder', 'unpaid', 'debt', 'plan', 'Carla', 'unique', 'lip', 'reading', 'abilities', 'rip-off', 'gang', 'violent', 'bank', 'robbers', 'now', 'Carla', 'turn', 'enter', 'frightening', 'new', 'world.The', 'fourth', 'feature', 'director', 'Jacques', 'Audiard', 'READ', 'MY', 'LIPS', 'begins', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'romantic', 'drama', 'two', 'marginalised', 'losers', 'only', 'shift', 'gears', 'halfway', 'edgy', 'thriller', 'where', 'symbiotic', 'shortcomings', 'turn', 'winners', 'leads', 'are', 'excellent', 'effortlessly', 'convincing', 'odd', 'couple', 'could', 'really', 'connect', 'Carla', 'first', 'meeting', 'Paul', 'enjoyable', 'farce', 'circumnavigate', 'surly', 'reticence', 'jailbird', 'manners', 'only', 'discover', 'was', 'very', 'recently', 'jailbird', 'Emmanuelle', 'Devos', 'who', 'Carla', 'almost', 'exclusive', 'ability', 'go', 'dowdy', 'gorgeous', 'back', 'again', 'frame', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Paul', 'cornered', 'dog', 'who', 'only', 'really', 'home', 'when', 'receiving', 'beating', 'concocting', 'rip-off', 'likely', 'get', 'killed.Like', 'many', 'French', 'films', 'READ', 'MY', 'LIPS', 'first', 'be', 'nothing', 'particular', 'scratch', 'surface', 'find', 'probably', 'everything', 'only', 'bum', 'note', 'subplot', 'concerning', 'missing', 'wife', 'Paul', 'parole', 'officer', 'device', 'contrived', 'only', 'help', 'steer', 'main', 'thrust', 'story', 'neat', 'little', 'feelgood', 'cul-de-sac.It', 'was', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', '60', 'first', 'introduced', 'concept', 'genre', 'film', 'making', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'medium', 'somewhat', 'compromised', 'when', 'have', 'use', 'system', 'labels', 'help', 'define', 'always', 'pleasure', 'discover', 'film', 'transcend', 'genre', 'better', 'still']",Read My Lips
755962,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00009OOFG,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 2]","After erasing my thoughts nearly twenty-seven times, there is a feeling that I can now conquer this review for the complex French drama, ""Read My Lips"".  Having written over five hundred reviews, I have never found myself at such a loss of words as I did with director Jacques Audiard's subtle, yet inspirational love story.  Thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film, and while the ""loves"" overpowered, it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind.  ""Read My Lips"" is a drama.  To be more precise, is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work.  Here is where this review begins to crumble, it is all of these items - but it is more...much, much more.  As a viewer, you are pulled in instantly by Emmanuelle Devos' portrayal of this fragile woman named Carla, whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty.  Audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid, causing an immediate unrest, not only from the characters within the film, but to those watching.  Without sound, the world is left open to any possibility, and that is frightening.As we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life, we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet Paul (played exquisitely by Vincent Cassel), a slicked-back hair, mustache-wearing lanky man who was just released from prison, homeless, jobless, and forced by his parole officer to get a job.  This is how Carla and Paul meet.  There is that moment of instant, unsettling attraction.  The one where we think she loves him, but he is dark (and here is where it gets even more fun) - and where we think he loves her, but she is dark.  The constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown.  Who, as viewers, are we to feel the most sympathy for?  Paul sleeps in the office, Carla helps him; Carla looses a contract to a rival co-worker, Paul helps her; Carla's ability to read people's lips comes in handy for a make-shift idea for Paul.  The continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair, waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave.  It never does.  Audiard cannot just allow this story to take place, he continually introduces us to more characters; one just as seedy as the next.  Even our rock, our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing - a subplot to this film that at first angered me, but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film.  Yet none of this could have happened if it weren't for our characters.  Devos' solemn and homely look is breathtaking, as she changes her image for Paul; the truth of her beauty is discovered.  Paul, the wildcard in the film, continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame.  Then, just as we assume one, Carla takes on one last shape.Audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters.  Cassel and Devos could just play cards the entire time and I would still be sitting at the end of my chair.  The story, probably the weakest part of this film, is at first random.  The interwoven stories seem unconnected at first, but Audiard lets them connect bit by bit.  Again, the entire parole officer segment was tangent, but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means.  Not attempting to sound vague, but this complex (yet utterly simple) story is difficult to explain.  There is plenty happening, but it is up to you to connect the pieces.  A favorite scene is when Carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held.  That use of sound and scene was brilliant.  It was tense, it was dramatic, and it was like watching a who-dun-it mystery unfold before your eyes.FILM: Watch this movie again and again.  At first I hated what ""Read My Lips"" brought to the screen, but after letting it mull in my mind for a couple of days, it proved to be something that had lasting ability.  The cast, the story (again, the weakest part), and the sound proved to be a complete jolt to the senses, proving that recycled stories can be told with unique and original twists.VISUALS: Watching this film upconverted in my Blu player, there were scenes that really stood out.  The darks were never quite that dark and the brief introduction to light hurt my eyes as it would the characters.  This film would benefit with a stronger release, where the color palate was upgraded and perhaps stronger translation, but from a DVD standpoint, this was perfect.SOUND:  Audiard's use of sound is one reason to watch this film.  Carla condition of being hearing impaired is pushed onto the audience, and the slight sounds that occur in the background give thought to what else may be happening that is beyond our sight.  Amazing work by Audiard to bring her focus into fruition.EXTRAS: Nothing.  Which is alright here - I would have loved a commentary or the actors speaking of their roles, but instead we are handed just a couple of trailers.  I liked the bare-bones of this film because it allowed me to make my own assumptions and win my own debates over what I just witnessed.  For ""Read My Lips"" it worked.Overall, I initially though this was a mediocre French film that I could easily forget about when it was over - I was proved wrong.  ""Read My Lips"" opens the floor for discussion, not just with the characters, but the situations.  One will find themselves rooting for Carla in one scene, and Paul in the next.  When a discovery is made in Paul's apartment by Carla, I found myself deeply angry.  Audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development, and what he was lacking in plot - the actors were able to carry.  I can easily suggest this film to anyone, but be prepared; this isn't a one time viewing film.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat.Grade: **** out of *****",4,Paul & Carla: A French Noir Love Story,1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,5962,"['erasing', 'thoughts', 'nearly', 'twenty-seven', 'times', 'feeling', 'can', 'now',

755963,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00009OOFG,Andy Orrock,"[5, 6]","Despite the fact I'd heard no buzz about it, I stumbled upon 'Read My Lips' earlier this year and thought I'd give it a try.  Now, I'm trying to spread the word to everyone I know:  See this movie.  'Read My Lips' is taut, thrilling, complex, and intelligent.  Everything you want in a movie-watching experience.French director Jacques Audiard has said of this film that he wanted to explore the possibilities from pairing an intelligent but not very good-looking woman with a good-looking man who's not the sharpest stick in the drawer.  Thus, we're presented with our anti-heroes, Carla and Paul.  Audiard does a great job giving us a visual painting of their respective backgrounds.Carla: nearly deaf, approaching 'old maid' status (35 and no prospects in sight), obviously bright but trundled on and all but ignored at work (consigned to be an admin at a male-dominated construction company), taken for granted by her friendsPaul: Just released from prison, no discernable talents outside of those that got him into hot water to begin with, desperate to find a job to kind his parole officer happy.These characters hook up, do a wary dance, and slowly realize how they can use each other's 'unique' talents.  What a ride.  It's brilliantly staged by Audiard.One item of note: dowdy and 'not good looking' (Audiard's term) Carla is played by Emmanuelle Devos, who only happens to be one of the world's most beautiful film actresses.  So, it takes quite a lot of work to establish the Carla character as overlooked and ignored.  Audiard does his brilliantly - for example, coffee cups and water glasses are left wordlessly on her desk as others kibbitz around her and blithely ignore her presence.  It's subtle, intelligent movie making, the kind of stuff you want to acknowledge and support.",5,'Read My Lips' is a treat for any intelligent movie watcher,1086739200,"06 9, 2004",2004,1794,"['fact', ""'d"", 'heard', 'buzz', 'stumbled', 'upon', ""'Read"", 'My', 'Lips', 'earlier', 'year', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try', 'Now', ""'m"", 'trying', 'spread', 'word', 'everyone', 'know', 'See', 'movie', ""'Read"", 'Lips', 'taut', 'thrilling', 'complex', 'intelligent', 'Everything', 'want', 'movie-watching', 'experience.French', 'director', 'Jacques', 'Audiard', 'said', 'film', 'wanted', 'explore', 'possibilities', 'pairing', 'intelligent', 'not', 'very', 'good-looking', 'woman', 'good-looking', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'sharpest', 'stick', 'drawer', 'Thus', ""'re"", 'presented', 'anti-heroes', 'Carla', 'Paul', 'Audiard', 'great', 'job', 'giving', 'visual', 'painting', 'respective', 'backgrounds.Carla', 'nearly', 'deaf', 'approaching', ""'old"", 'maid', 'status', '35', 'prospects', 'sight', 'obviously', 'bright', 'trundled', 'ignored', 'work', 'consigned', 'be', 'admin', 'male-dominated', 'construction', 'company', 'taken', 'granted', 'friendsPaul', 'Just', 'released', 'prison', 'discernable', 'talents', 'got', 'hot', 'water', 'begin', 'desperate', 'find', 'job', 'kind', 'parole', 'officer', 'happy.These', 'characters', 'hook', 'up', 'do', 'wary', 'dance', 'slowly', 'realize', 'how', 'can', 'use', 'other', ""'unique"", 'talents', 'What', 'ride', 'brilliantly', 'staged', 'Audiard.One', 'item', 'note', 'dowdy', 'good', 'looking', 'Audiard', 'term', 'Carla', 'played', 'Emmanuelle', 'Devos', 'who', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'beautiful', 'film', 'actresses', 'So', 'quite', 'lot', 'work', 'establish', 'Carla', 'character', 'overlooked', 'ignored', 'Audiard', 'brilliantly', 'example', 'coffee', 'cups', 'water', 'glasses', 'are', 'left', 'wordlessly', 'desk', 'others', 'kibbitz', 'blithely', 'ignore', 'presence', 'subtle', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'making', 'kind', 'stuff', 'want', 'acknowledge', 'support']",Read My Lips
755964,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00009OOFG,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[3, 5]","Work at SEDIM, an architectural firm, isn't a bed of roses for Carla Behm.  As its office assistant, she suffers from what the folk group the Shams called the file clerk blues.  Things are hectic, as she spends the day sending faxes, answering the phone, directing calls, taking messages, signing for packages, and having to deal with employees who dump their half-empty coffee cups on her desk.  She is hearing impaired, though, requiring two hearing aids that she can activate or deactivate, as she does during lunch.  There, she lip-reads and finds out how she's considered a loser and a joke.  She's homely and what man would want her?  More to the point, she's resentful that despite being talented and able to handle bids, her higher-ups get them and of course the commission from winning the bids.She decides to employ a personal assistant and it turns out to be a recently released ex-con named Paul, whose kind of doped-up look and slurry mannerisms make him a doubtful candidate.  He knows next to nothing about office equipment but she decides to help him out by giving him a place on a building site whose construction is delayed for months.  In return, he helps Carla sabotage Keller, a colleague who seems intent on keeping Carla down.  However, things take a turn when someone asks for Paul.  She's horrified to witness him being beaten up by that someone.  Turns out that Paul borrowed lots of money from a loan shark, who's giving him until the next day to pay up or else.  Marchand, who inherited the loan shark's accounts and owns a nightclub, allows him to work off his debts for the full amount, meaning he has to quit working for Carla.The teaming up of Carla and Paul signals an awakening in them both.  Carla is slow to admit being attracted to him, but when she invites him to a friend's party, she asks him to act as if they're friends, and even to hold her hand.  Through him, she feels validated, that she is somebody and has a life because she has a male companion.  As if to maintain that need, she does tell him once that he does owe her.  She feels frustrated at his callousness at times, and finds out she needs him as her partner at the office.  He in turn sees her in a position of power, but finds she's unique in her gift.She's naturally taken aback when Paul asks her to spy on his boss, who's organizing some sort of dodgy deal with the Carombo brothers.  As she can read lips, she can use  binoculars from the roof of the club and ""see"" what they're saying.  That's one aspect of her disability that comes in handy.  Holding crying babies or going into high decibel discotheques is nothing for her, as she can remove her hearing implants, and now...Interspersed is a subplot involving Paul's parole officer, whose wife has been missing for several days.  The resolution of that is unexplained but one can make valid assumptions on that part.As the put upon Carla, Emmanuelle Devos exudes a character one can empathize with.  She feels self-conscious because.  But despite looking ordinary, she's still pleasant and even pretty when she smiles.  The movie succeeds in defying the stereotypical prettifying  the lead woman into a flower.  The result is a half workplace drama, half crime drama where the characters gradually go from being attracted by each others talents to being physically attracted to each other.",4,Reading each other--the reawakening of Carla Behm,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,3354,"['Work', 'SEDIM', 'architectural', 'firm', ""n't"", 'bed', 'roses', 'Carla', 'Behm', 'office', 'assistant', 'what', 'folk', 'group', 'Shams', 'called', 'file', 'clerk', 'blues', 'Things', 'are', 'hectic', 'day', 'sending', 'faxes', 'answering', 'phone', 'directing', 'calls', 'taking', 'messages', 'signing', 'packages', 'having', 'deal', 'employees', 'who', 'dump', 'half-empty', 'coffee', 'cups', 'desk', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'though', 'requiring', 'two', 'hearing', 'aids', 'can', 'activate', 'deactivate', 'lunch', 'lip-reads', 'out', 'how', 'considered', 'loser', 'joke', 'homely', 'what', 'man', 'would', 'want', 'More', 'point', 'resentful', 'being', 'talented', 'able', 'handle', 'bids', 'higher-ups', 'get', 'course', 'commission', 'winning', 'bids.She', 'employ', 'personal', 'assistant', 'out', 'be', 'recently', 'released', 'ex-con', 'named', 'Paul', 'kind', 'doped-up', 'look', 'slurry', 'mannerisms', 'make', 'doubtful', 'candidate', 'next', 'nothing', 'office', 'equipment', 'help', 'out', 'giving', 'place', 'building', 'site', 'construction', 'delayed', 'months', 'return', 'Carla', 'sabotage', 'Keller', 'colleague', 'who', 'intent', 'keeping', 'Carla', 'down', 'However', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'when', 'someone', 'Paul', 'horrified', 'witness', 'being', 'beaten', 'up', 'someone', 'out', 'Paul', 'borrowed', 'lots', 'money', 'loan', 'shark', 'who', 'giving', 'next', 'day', 'pay', 'up', 'else', 'Marchand', 'who', 'inherited', 'loan', 'shark', 'accounts', 'nightclub', 'work', 'off', 'debts', 'full', 'amount', 'meaning', 'quit', 'working', 'Carla.The', 'teaming', 'up', 'Carla', 'Paul', 'signals', 'awakening', 'Carla', 'slow', 'admit', 'being', 'attracted', 'when', 'friend', 'party', 'act', ""'re"", 'friends', 'even', 'hold', 'hand', 'validated', 'somebody', 'life', 'male', 'companion', 'maintain', 'need', 'tell', 'once', 'owe', 'frustrated', 'callousness', 'times', 'out', 'partner', 'office', 'turn', 'position', 'power', 'unique', 'gift.She', 'naturally', 'taken', 'aback', 'when', 'Paul', 'spy', 'boss', 'who', 'organizing', 'sort', 'dodgy', 'deal', 'Carombo', 'brothers', 'can', 'read', 'lips', 'can', 'use', 'binoculars', 'roof', 'club', 'see', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying', 'one', 'aspect', 'disability', 'handy', 'Holding', 'crying', 'babies', 'going', 'high', 'decibel', 'discotheques', 'nothing', 'can', 'remove', 'hearing', 'implants', 'now', 'Interspersed', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Paul', 'parole', 'officer', 'wife', 'been', 'missing', 'several', 'days', 'resolution', 'unexplained', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'valid', 'assumptions', 'put', 'Carla', 'Emmanuelle', 'Devos', 'character', 'one', 'can', 'empathize', 'feels', 'self-conscious', 'looking', 'ordinary', 'still', 'pleasant', 'even', 'pretty', 'when', 'movie', 'defying', 'stereotypical', 'prettifying', 'lead', 'woman', 'flower', 'result', 'half', 'workplace', 'drama', 'half', 'crime', 'drama', 'where', 'characters', 'gradually', 'go', 'being', 'attracted', 'others', 'talents', 'being', 'physically', 'attracted', 'other']",Read My Lips

You won't regret it.What French director Jacques Audiard has done is create a taunt noir thriller with a romantic subplot intricately woven into the fabric of the main plot, told in the realistic and nonglamorous manner usually seen in films that win international awards.  In fact, Sur mes l&egrave;vre did indeed win a Cesar (for Emmanuelle Devos) and some other awards.  For Audiard character development and delineation are more important than action, yet the action is extremely tense.  The romance is of the counter-cultural sort seen in films like, say, Kalifornia (1993) or Natural Born Killer (1994) or the Aussie Kiss or Kill (1997), a genre I call ""grunge love on the lam"" except that the principles here are not on the road (yet) and still have most of their moral compasses intact.Vincent Cassel and Emmanuelle Devos play the nonglamorous leads, Paul and Carla.  Carla is a mousy corporate secretary--actually she's supposed to be mousy, but in fact is intriguing and charismatic and more than a wee bit sexy.  But she is inexperienced with men, doesn't dance, is something of a workaholic who lives out a fantasy life home alone with herself.  She is partially deaf and adept at reading lips, a talent that figures prominently in the story.  She is a little put on by the world and likes to remove her hearing aid or turn it off.  When she collapses from overwork her boss suggests she hire an assistant.  She hires Paul, who is just out of prison, even though he has no clerical experience.  He is filled with the sort of bad boy sex appeal that may recall Jean-Paul Belmondo in Godard's Breathless (1959) or even Richard Gere in the American remake from 1983.  We get the sense that Carla doesn't realize that she hired him because she found him attractive.  When Carla gets squeezed out of credit for a company deal, she gets Paul to help her turn the tables.  From there it is but a step to a larger crime.  Note that Carla is unconsciously getting Paul to ""prove"" his love for her (and his virility) by doing what she wants, working for her, appearing in front of her girl friends as her beau, etc.The camera work features tense, off-center closeups so that we see a lot of the action not in the center of our field of vision but to the periphery as in things partially hidden or overheard or seen out of the corner of our eyes.  Audiard wants to avoid any sense of a set or a stage.  The camera is not at the center of the action, but is a spy that catches just enough of what is going on for us to follow.  Additionally, the film is sharply cut so that many scenes are truncated or even omitted and it is left for us to surmise what has happened.  This has the effect of heightening the viewer's involvement, although one has to pay attention.  Enhancing the staccato frenzy is a sparse use of dialogue.  This works especially well for those who do not speak French since the distraction of having to follow the subtitles is kept to a minimum.Powering the film is a script that reveals and explores the unconscious psychological mechanisms of the main characters while dramatizing both their growing attraction to each other and their shared criminal enterprise.  But more than that is the on-screen chemistry starkly and subtly developed by both Devos and Cessel.  It is pleasing to note that the usual thriller plot contrivances are kept to a minimum here, and the surprises really are surprises.See this for Emmanuelle Devos whose skill and offbeat charisma more than make up for a lack of glamor, and for Vincent Cassel for a testosterone-filled performance so intense one can almost smell the leather jacket.",5,Smell my shirt,1073865600,"01 12, 2004",2004,3889,"['who', 'have', 'seen', 'rather', 'extraordinary', 'romantic', 'thriller', 'noir', 'review', 'title', 'self-explanatory', 'cinema', 'verit', 'eacute', '21st', 'century', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'let', 'note', 'slowly', 'stay', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'it.What', 'French', 'director', 'Jacques', 'Audiard', 'done', 'create', 'taunt', 'noir', 'thriller', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'intricately', 'woven', 'fabric', 'main', 'plot', 'told', 'realistic', 'nonglamorous', 'manner', 'usually', 'seen', 'films', 'win', 'international', 'awards', 'fact', 'Sur', 'l', 'egrave', 'vre', 'did', 'indeed', 'win', 'Cesar', 'Emmanuelle', 'Devos', 'other', 'awards', 'Audiard', 'character', 'development', 'delineation', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'action', 'yet', 'action', 'extremely', 'tense', 'romance', 'counter-cultural', 'sort', 'seen', 'films', 'say', 'Kalifornia', '1993', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killer', '1994', 'Aussie', 'Kiss', 'Kill', '1997', 'genre', 'call', 'grunge', 'love', 'lam', 'principles', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'road', 'yet', 'still', 'have', 'most', 'moral', 'compasses', 'intact.Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Emmanuelle', 'Devos', 'play', 'nonglamorous', 'leads', 'Paul', 'Carla', 'Carla', 'mousy', 'corporate', 'secretary', 'actually', 'supposed', 'be', 'mousy', 'fact', 'intriguing', 'charismatic', 'more', 'wee', 'bit', 'sexy', 'inexperienced', 'men', ""n't"", 'dance', 'something', 'workaholic', 'who', 'out', 'fantasy', 'life', 'home', 'alone', 'partially', 'deaf', 'adept', 'reading', 'lips', 'talent', 'prominently', 'story', 'little', 'put', 'world', 'likes', 'remove', 'hearing', 'aid', 'turn', 'off', 'When', 'overwork', 'boss', 'hire', 'assistant', 'Paul', 'who', 'just', 'prison', 'even', 'clerical', 'experience', 'filled', 'sort', 'bad', 'boy', 'sex', 'appeal', 'may', 'recall', 'Jean-Paul', 'Belmondo', 'Godard', 'Breathless', '1959', 'even', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'American', 'remake', '1983', 'get', 'sense', 'Carla', ""n't"", 'realize', 'hired', 'found', 'attractive', 'When', 'Carla', 'squeezed', 'credit', 'company', 'deal', 'Paul', 'help', 'turn', 'tables', 'step', 'larger', 'crime', 'Note', 'Carla', 'unconsciously', 'getting', 'Paul', 'prove', 'love', 'virility', 'doing', 'what', 'working', 'appearing', 'front', 'girl', 'friends', 'beau', 'etc.The', 'camera', 'work', 'features', 'tense', 'off-center', 'closeups', 'so', 'see', 'lot', 'action', 'not', 'center', 'field', 'vision', 'periphery', 'things', 'partially', 'hidden', 'overheard', 'seen', 'corner', 'eyes', 'Audiard', 'avoid', 'sense', 'set', 'stage', 'camera', 'not', 'center', 'action', 'spy', 'just', 'enough', 'what', 'going', 'follow', 'Additionally', 'film', 'sharply', 'cut', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'truncated', 'even', 'omitted', 'left', 'surmise', 'what', 'happened', 'effect', 'heightening', 'viewer', 'involvement', 'one', 'pay', 'attention', 'Enhancing', 'staccato', 'frenzy', 'sparse', 'use', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'well', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'French', 'distraction', 'having', 'follow', 'subtitles', 'kept', 'minimum.Powering', 'film', 'script', 'reveals', 'unconscious', 'psychological', 'mechanisms', 'main', 'characters', 'dramatizing', 'growing', 'attraction', 'other', 'shared', 'criminal', 'enterprise', 'more', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'starkly', 'subtly', 'developed', 'Devos', 'Cessel', 'pleasing', 'note', 'usual', 'thriller', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'are', 'kept', 'minimum', 'here', 'surprises', 'really', 'are', 'surprises.See', 'Emmanuelle', 'Devos', 'skill', 'offbeat', 'charisma', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'glamor', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'testosterone-filled', 'performance', 'so', 'intense', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'smell', 'leather', 'jacket']",Read My Lips

She wears frumpy clothing, and works hard. Too hard. She also has a handicap -- she is hearing-impaired, and underneath her hair, she wears hearing aids in both ears. Her co-workers do not fraternize with her, and they make fun of her plain appearance and un-sexines. She knows this, because she can read their lips from across the lunch room. She longs for excitement and romance.Carla is the boss's right arm. Very competent, but overworked. One day, she collapses in exhaustion, and her boss suggests that she hire an assistant to help relieve some of the drudgework she's been doing.She agrees, but her first candidate turns out to be an ex-con. He lies about his office skills, but she hires him and tries to groom him into a decent employee, probably just to have some male company. He's attractive in an unkempt, roguish sort of way, and she trains him as a gofer and copy-room worker.The trailer says something like, ""She taught him good manners... He taught her to be bad."" In fact, she uses him, by asking him to steal a file from one of her colleagues who cheated her out of a development property she had been working on. The colleague is completely humiliated by the loss of the file, and Carla has to step in to deliver the pitch for the property before the local development council. Score one for the deaf girl.Things get a bit dicier when the ex-con sees a chance to get back at a loan shark he's indebted to, and make some bucks in the process. He needs Carla's lip-reading skills -- to spy on the shark's apartment while his gang plans the caper. The scheme goes sour, and therein lies the action and suspense that one reviewer called ""Hitchcockian.""I don't see much of Hitchcock in this film, but it is a good story, the characters are well-drawn and superbly acted. There's a little double entendre in the title, I think.

Director Jacques Audiard with and co-writer Tonino Benacquista have created a tense, tight, completely entertaining little thriller that makes some significant statements about out of the norm individuals and their plights.Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is a plain Jane, mostly deaf, thirty something unnoticed secretary for a company whose life is one of social and sexual isolation and whose view of the future is rather bleak.  Enter Paul (Vincent Cassel) a recent released ex-con parolee who responds to an ad to be Carla's assistant.  There is a mutual physical repulsion at first meeting: Carla had hoped for a well-groomed, genteel man who might fulfill her fantasies and Paul is a coarse, unkempt sleazy guy who is not impressed with being a clerk.  Their concepts change rather quickly when Paul salvages  Carla's job by filling her request to steal a letter that would cost her her job and Paul discovers Carla's lip reading ability which he sees as a way to spy on the criminals from his past who threaten his life for money owed.  So this odd couple of a team join forces and together enter a dangerous suspense filled ploy to gain Paul's safety and freedom.  The relationship is full of twists and edge of the seat suspense with each of these unlikely characters fulfilling roles in their lives that fill the chinks in their walls of isolation in surprising ways.Devos and Cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong. Once again Alexandre Desplat has produced a musical score that enhances the tension and cinematographer Mathieu Vadepied finds all the right lighting and angles to suggest the worlds of isolation of the characters as well as the Hitchcockian sense of suspense.  Director Audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story: he shows us the difference between 'hearing' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments.  This is a fine film that remains in the ranks of the best of the French film noir genre.  Recommended.

Unnoticed by her coworkers Carla finds that they frequently use her desk as a trashcan to discard half-empty paper cups.  The only time the coworkers seem to recognize her is during the lunch hour when they make crude sexual jokes about her, which they keep in between themselves.  However, Carla knows that the coworkers use her for their personal enjoyment as she possess the ability to read lips, which functions as a double edge sword as her knowledge of their thoughts continues to harm her already low self-esteem.When the anxious, stressed, insecure, and overworked Carla faints in her bosses office he suggests that she hire an aid for herself.  Carla contacts a temp agency that sends her Paul (Vincent Cassel) to help her with her daily chores at her job.  Paul, an unskilled former convict with no money and very few possessions, gets the job through a number of lies.  However, Carla discovers his secret, but instead of turning him in she helps him keep the job.  The reason is that Carla desires someone, someone to see her, and this someone happens to be Paul.  Feebly Carla attempts to find a way for him to notice her by helping him in various ways, which sends mixed messages, as Paul seems to believe that she is using him for her own needs.The two main characters begin a slow dance where both are extremely cautious not to step on the others toes.  It is an emotionally saturated dance where feelings are constrained as if feelings are a sign of weakness.  Symbolically the dance between Carla and Paul revolves around her hearing-impairment, as she is incapable of sending the right signals, yet fully capable of reading the signals.  The dance draws both characters into a world of greed, deceit, and murder where they must blindly rely on one another.Jacques Audiard's direction brings the audience an intelligent thriller with several intriguing subplots enhanced through the terrific use of sound.

It showed a disabled woman able to make a life for herself and did so without sympathy or dwelling on the disability.  The fact that she could read lips became the focal point of the second half of the film.  Emmannuel Devos may have been too pretty for the supposedly plain character of Carla, but her acting was convincing with costume, hairstyle and makeup all accentuating her lack of glamour.  She reveals the inner life and insecurity of the character with quick winces of the eye and wry smiles.Director Jacques Audiard does a good job of pacing the film.  We get introduced to the characters, come to know them a bit, and then have the complications start to stack.  The film doesn't crescendo in a raging climax like Hollywood cinema might prefer, but instead gives a more real sense of how these events impact the lives of Carla and Paul.  Audiard also received the French Academy of Cinema award for best screenplay for the film and was nominated for best director.As Paul Angeli, Vincent Cassel is breathtaking.  I'd seen him before in an American film &quot;Birthday Girl&quot; with Nicole Kidman as a Russian mail order bride who scams her grooms.  Cassel was one of her Russian buddies who show up unexpectedly.  In &quot;Read My Lips&quot; he's an ex-con with few possibilities.  Despite his lack of talent and the violent life he's been used to, he has a great heart and treats Carla kindly.  The attraction is uneasy due to the characters' situations, but comes across as electric.  As &quot;Read My Lips&quot; bumps and stutters to its final images of Paul groping Carla's leg, it is an uncompromising joy ride.

Carla, played by Emmanuelle Devos, is a secretary in her mid thirties.  She's mostly not noticed by her peers and is often called upon to do favors for her friends.  She has a hearing aid and, when she uses it, she can hear everything.  She can also read lips.Because she is overworked, her boss says she can hire an assistant.  She chooses a good looking male ex-con without any skills, played by Vincent Cassel.  She asks him for a favor which has to do with stealing some documents which will result in her getting a promotion at work.  After that, he asks her to use her lip-reading skills to help him out in a caper.  It's not all as simple as that though. Eventually, everything spins out of control and the caper takes over.  It's a fast paced romp from here on in with the bittersweet beginnings of a romance.

It takes a girl who is plain and has a hearing impairment and gives her  charisma and brains. Instead of her staying a victim in a world of business, she breaks the mold and takes charge. She meets a man who is also a victim like herself, a convict on parole, gives him a job as her assistant, finds him a place to live, and helps him with money. They take to one another, they form a team and work as a team to get something out of life. Instead of continuing to be victims and get the short end of the stick, they turn it around and beat the system. I loved this! They go about things by stealing but who cares, it was fun to watch and see them outwit and outsmart. The sexual tension is high, the movie never really shows any sex but the hint of their attraction keeps growing and growing. They really begin to care for one another. They seem to almost be soulmates, the way they work together, both of them linked in a way that the movie illustrates very nicely. I am told that the actress won the Cesar award in France for her portrayl of Carla. Also Vincent Cassell stars, you may know him in the film La Haine or Hate, which I think Jodie Foster produced.

This is a wonderful head trip for any movie fan familiar with the conventions of office dramas and heist thrillers and a willingness to read subtitles. There were points in this movie when I laughed aloud with delight at the surprising turns of plot and the wonderful, quirky details in the performances, the direction, the soundtrack, and the kinetic camera work and editing.This will not be everybody's idea of entertainment. The two leads are the opposite of glamorous, and the chemistry between them is more about clever calculation and quick thinking than romantic attraction. There is, in fact, no sex and only a hint of nudity. While there are a couple of pretty nasty, brutish types capable of bloody punch-ups and clearly a willingness to kill, the violence in the film does not build up to a gut-clenching crescendo. Instead, the film generates a fair degree of suspense, but of an old-fashioned kind that is more like Hitchcock -- almost elegant. No car chases or explosions.I loved this film. Not having read reviews, I was continually taken by surprise, realizing that every unexpected turn of plot as it came was also completely plausible, until I was so far sucked into the movie that plausibility didn't matter any more.

And as things come together, ambiguous elements purposely (I think) leave unresolved plot points up to the viewer. I'll be re-viewing this on-edge thriller maybe a few more times, but I must still fill in the blanks myself. Was what's done done on purpose by the character? Were we so wrong throughout the story about the nature of characters? Are the protagonists good, bad, just human? Will they, did they? Why did they? Which motivation(s) moved them? Perplexing and very enjoyable tensions separate this from most films, especially explicit Western-made films.Another french movie with open ends, quite nuanced and complex, is TELL NO ONETell No Onefrom the book by best-selling American Harlan Corben.

You are drawn into the close private world of a deaf, not generally socially integrated woman, and you feel her sense of isolation with every shot. These are tight almost claustrophobic shots, you are breathing her air. She hunches over, and avoids directly looking at people and places and most scenes are built by close downward looking shots.

755985,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B00009OOFG,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[9, 33]","Any number of current French films seem to be afflicted by the same widespread but unacknowledged disease, that of an odd ponderousness.  What should be fleet and deft - and would have been, say, in the New Wave films of the 60's - emerges in them as unduly protracted, non-incrementally repetitious and - overall - labored in the extreme. Clearly their directors are suffering from a mysterious self-consciousness and self-importance. The cloyingly sentimental ""Dreamlife of Angels,"" the leaden, charmless ""Amelie,"" and now the neo-noir TV soap opera ""Sur Mes Levres"" all fall within this category.""Sur Mes Levres"" in particular clearly shows, first of all, the evils of that lingering French love affair with earlier Hollywood noir films. The director, happily conversant with film history, wants to update noir. Fascinating enough. But in his hands the usually fast-paced, less than 90 minute B movie component of the older films is unfortunately expanded to a plodding, clumsily contrived, almost unbearable two hours. With such paucity of content, there is little justification for the indulgence of so much screen time.  Audiard is chewing on a souffle as if it were jerky.An equally baleful influence on this film is that of contemporary television.  Not only do the jerky camera and the excessive, almost exclusive use of closeups - headache inducing by the way - resemble the ""art"" of MTV, but the central story, a lingering look at the vagaries of a modern ""relationship"" owes  both its drawn out and repetitive portrayal to the soap opera romances which go on for years and years.  Its great insight into the battle of the sexes, apparently, is its trite recognition that for the shirt-sniffing heroine, ""no"" in sexual matters in fact may mean ""yes."" The temptation is strong simply to dismiss this endeavor as French and let it go at that.",2,Another Fallen Souffle,1027814400,"07 28, 2002",2002,1851,"['number', 'current', 'French', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'afflicted', 'same', 'widespread', 'unacknowledged', 'disease', 'odd', 'ponderousness', 'What', 'should', 'be', 'fleet', 'deft', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'say', 'New', 'Wave', 'films', '60', 'emerges', 'unduly', 'protracted', 'non-incrementally', 'repetitious', 'overall', 'labored', 'extreme', 'Clearly', 'directors', 'are', 'suffering', 'mysterious', 'self-consciousness', 'self-importance', 'cloyingly', 'sentimental', 'Dreamlife', 'Angels', 'leaden', 'charmless', 'Amelie', 'now', 'neo-noir', 'TV', 'soap', 'Sur', 'Mes', 'Levres', 'fall', 'category', 'Sur', 'Mes', 'Levres', 'particular', 'clearly', 'shows', 'first', 'evils', 'lingering', 'French', 'love', 'affair', 'earlier', 'Hollywood', 'noir', 'films', 'director', 'happily', 'conversant', 'film', 'history', 'update', 'noir', 'Fascinating', 'enough', 'hands', 'usually', 'fast-paced', 'less', '90', 'minute', 'B', 'movie', 'component', 'older', 'films', 'unfortunately', 'expanded', 'plodding', 'clumsily', 'contrived', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'two', 'hours', 'such', 'paucity', 'content', 'little', 'justification', 'indulgence', 'so', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Audiard', 'chewing', 'souffle', 'were', 'jerky.An', 'equally', 'baleful', 'influence', 'film', 'contemporary', 'television', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'jerky', 'camera', 'excessive', 'almost', 'exclusive', 'use', 'closeups', 'headache', 'inducing', 'way', 'resemble', 'art', 'MTV', 'central', 'story', 'lingering', 'look', 'vagaries', 'modern', 'relationship', 'drawn', 'repetitive', 'portrayal', 'soap', 'opera', 'romances', 'go', 'years', 'years', 'great', 'insight', 'battle', 'sexes', 'apparently', 'trite', 'recognition', 'shirt-sniffing', 'heroine', 'sexual', 'matters', 'fact', 'may', 'mean', 'yes', 'temptation', 'strong', 'simply', 'dismiss', 'endeavor', 'French', 'let', 'go']",Read My Lips

And this film is also a great noir, based on one simple idea which Audiard uses quite brilliantly.The film is seen from the viewpoint of Carla (Devos), who works at a small office as secretary.  Carla, who is now mid-thirty and needs a hearing aid, is always ignored at her office, and is made to work hard before the copy-machine.  And her life is utterly lonely.So, when the boss told Carla to hire an assistant, she wants someone whom she can definitely &quot;amiable.&quot;  And preferably, male.  Enters a guy named Paul (Cassel), who is, as he reveals soon, on parole, and may still have some connection with the underworld.  Does she hire him?  Why not, and he is very handsome.The relations between Carla and Paul lead on to the series of unexpected events, including a love story and big money.  Carla is clearly in love with Paul, but at the same time she kind of exploits him as his possible &quot;love&quot; and employer; Paul also uses her special gift of &quot;reading lips&quot; in the situation like &quot;Rear Window,&quot; in which he might get even with the gangster who had once humiliated him.&quot;Read My Lips&quot; belongs to the genre of noir, some people say rightly, but the film works better as a romance between two losers in society.  It's not an usual love or romance.  It's a kind of romance in which one finds a consolation in the other, but the act starts to violate the codes of ethics as it goes on and on.  There are crimes depicted here, but the most profoundly moving one is about the very dangerous relationship between Carla and Paul, or especially anything about Carla, who manipulates and is manipulated.Great acting from Emmanuelle Devos who must be both &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;seductive&quot; at the same time.  She simply rivets your eyes on the screen whenever she appears.  No wonder she beat Audrey Tautou at Cesar Awards, winning the best actress.  Even Vincent Cassel pales before him, and that's really something.The only complaint is its unnecessary sub-plot about the parole officer, which looks as if mercilessly cut to make room for the two leads.  I thought, OK, but why not cut it all?That aside, &quot;Read My Lips&quot; is a strong film about the power-game between the man and woman.  Rarely was the relation between man and woman depicted so convincingly.  And love, very fragile kind of love.",5,Partners in Love and Crime: Romantic in its Original Way,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,2580,"['quot', 'Read', 'My', 'Lips', 'quot', 'stars', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'quot', 'Crimson', 'Rivers', 'quot', 'Emmanulle', 'Devos', 'directed', 'Jacques', 'Audiard', 'father', 'Michael', 'was', 'also', 'film', 'business', 'famous', 'writer', 'many', 'Fench', 'noir', 'films', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'noir', 'based', 'one', 'simple', 'idea', 'Audiard', 'quite', 'brilliantly.The', 'film', 'seen', 'viewpoint', 'Carla', 'Devos', 'who', 'small', 'office', 'secretary', 'Carla', 'who', 'now', 'mid-thirty', 'hearing', 'aid', 'always', 'ignored', 'office', 'made', 'work', 'hard', 'copy-machine', 'life', 'utterly', 'lonely.So', 'when', 'boss', 'told', 'Carla', 'hire', 'assistant', 'someone', 'whom', 'can', 'definitely', 'quot', 'quot', 'preferably', 'male', 'Enters', 'guy', 'named', 'Paul', 'Cassel', 'who', 'soon', 'parole', 'may', 'still', 'have', 'connection', 'underworld', 'hire', 'Why', 'not', 'very', 'handsome.The', 'relations', 'Carla', 'Paul', 'lead', 'series', 'unexpected', 'events', 'including', 'love', 'story', 'big', 'money', 'Carla', 'clearly', 'love', 'Paul', 'same', 'time', 'kind', 'exploits', 'possible', 'quot', 'quot', 'employer', 'Paul', 'also', 'special', 'gift', 'quot', 'reading', 'lips', 'quot', 'situation', 'quot', 'Rear', 'Window', 'quot', 'might', 'get', 'even', 'gangster', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'humiliated', 'him.', 'quot', 'Read', 'My', 'Lips', 'quot', 'genre', 'noir', 'people', 'say', 'rightly', 'film', 'better', 'romance', 'two', 'losers', 'society', 'not', 'usual', 'love', 'romance', 'kind', 'romance', 'one', 'consolation', 'other', 'act', 'violate', 'codes', 'ethics', 'are', 'crimes', 'depicted', 'here', 'most', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'one', 'very', 'dangerous', 'relationship', 'Carla', 'Paul', 'especially', 'anything', 'Carla', 'who', 'manipulated.Great', 'acting', 'Emmanuelle', 'Devos', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'quot', 'ugly', 'quot', 'quot', 'seductive', 'quot', 'same', 'time', 'simply', 'eyes', 'screen', 'whenever', 'wonder', 'beat', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'Cesar', 'Awards', 'winning', 'best', 'actress', 'Even', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'pales', 'really', 'something.The', 'only', 'complaint', 'unnecessary', 'sub-plot', 'parole', 'officer', 'mercilessly', 'cut', 'make', 'room', 'two', 'leads', 'thought', 'OK', 'why', 'not', 'cut', 'aside', 'quot', 'Read', 'My', 'Lips', 'quot', 'strong', 'film', 'power-game', 'man', 'woman', 'Rarely', 'was', 'relation', 'man', 'woman', 'depicted', 'so', 'convincingly', 'love', 'very', 'fragile', 'kind', 'love']",Read My Lips
755987,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00009OOFG,Turfseer,"[1, 7]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Carla is a partially deaf woman who works in an office at a real estate firm in Paris. I was a bit unsure as to whether I found Carla to be wholly believable. She's one of those lonely hearts who somehow is sexually repressed. Her lack of confidence is explained by her handicap as well as constantly being made fun of by her co-workers. She is so stressed out that she ends up fainting on the job, which leads her boss (who unlike the intolerant co-workers) offers to hire an assistant for her. The arrival of the assistant, Paul, a parolee, is the film's inciting incident.Carla begins her Act 2 journey tied to Paul, who makes it quite clear that office work just isn't his 'thing'. Carla at first plays hard to get with bad boy Paul due to that sexual repression. Even if you buy the idea that no-so-bad-looking Carla is clueless when it comes to men, she has no guilt feelings about moving up in the office hierarchy. Ironically, it's not the amoral Paul who urges her to come up with the idea of stealing a co-worker's file, leading to the co-worker's resignation--it's actually Carla herself! As a result, mousy little Carla is promoted from secretary to project manager. After Carla finds Paul a place to stay, an apartment under construction, owned by her firm--she makes it clear that she no longer has any fear of the fledging sociopath when boldly stating to him: ""You owe me"".While Vincent Cassell is fairly convincing as Paul, the character could have used a bit more humor. He just was a little too one-note for me, although Cassell does well in establishing Paul as truly menacing. The rest of 'Read my lips' chronicles Carla's defection to the 'dark side' as she transforms herself into the amoral counterpart of her bad boy love interest. Carla's transformation takes place gradually--she puts on a sexy outfit but almost gets herself raped outside a nightclub, only to be saved by Paul who is now beginning to show a 'sensitive' side. Now it's Carla's turn to pay Paul back for his 'good deed' and agrees to hang out on a rooftop, clutching a pair of binoculars, and attempting to read the lips of Paul's new boss, Marchand, and his sleazy associates, so that Paul may discover if they're plotting a crime, which ultimately might give him a chance to rip them off.While the whole idea that Carla is actually able to read the lips of people through binoculars seems a bit dubious, I was willing to suspend my disbelief with the hope that the second half of Act 2, your basic caper story, picked up. Some of it's clever, as a plane ticket apparently is the Macguffin here, with Carla breaking into Marchand's apartment and planting the ticket inside his coat--thus leading his associates to believe that Marchand has double crossed them, stealing their money and then apparently buying the ticket with plans to leave the country. As it turns out, it's Carla and Paul who have pulled off the heist and leave Marchand holding the proverbial bag. Not all of it's clear as Marchand and company attack each other off screen and we never get to learn who exactly is killed and who survives.The film's denouement is a big letdown as it becomes clear that director Jacques Audiard's sympathies lie more with the criminal element than with a law abiding citizenry. At first one wonders if Audiard is merely presenting a film noir-like tale of an amoral couple 'getting away' with a crime without being punished. That works in a film like 'Chinatown', since the film's scenarists are not making a statement, approving of the amoral characters' behavior but merely chronicling a sordid verisimilitude. In 'Read my Lips', however, Audiard's 'Carla and Paul' have become the French version of 'Bonnie and Clyde'.Carla finally casts off her sexual aversions and gets down with the bad boy at film's end. She's now united with Paul in flipping the bird at respectable society (remember Audiard feels that Carla is justified in her rebellion as the so-called 'respectable' members of society are the very people who made fun of her in the office because of her disability). Despite committing a crime, Audiard doesn't see this as such as bad thing, since after all, the victims here are much more unsavory than Carla and Paul (but do Carla and Paul really come off as completely untainted? I do seem to recall that Marchand's wife is unfairly used by Carla in this scheme, and is left at scene of the crime to face the wrath of either a betrayed husband or his vengeful partners in crime. Not very noble of either one of them!).For those who don't understand why the parole officer appears in this film, I believe I can explain it. For Director Audiard, Paul's Parole Officer is the key to explaining the film's theme. All along, we're led to believe that the Parole Officer represents the good part of society--he's more like a social worker trying to help Paul (unlike the unmentionables who made fun of Carla back at the office). But when Paul and Carla 'run into' Paul at the film's climax, it's the Parole Office who is being led away by the police for killing his wife (in an apparent mercy killing). So now the ultimate symbol of the law abiding citizenry is an apparent murderer and the amoral protagonists (lonely heart Carla transformed into bad girl who joins already bad boy Paul) are actually charming waifs who have committed a wholly justifiable robbery.One can only conclude that 'Read My Lips' ultimately devolves into a 'feel good' fairy tale of amoral criminals, whom Director Audiard clearly wants us to root for. You might be bewitched by Carla's transformation or the mechanics of Paul's heist scheme, but ultimately there's nothing admirable about the protagonists' sordid machinations.",2,Partially disabled
