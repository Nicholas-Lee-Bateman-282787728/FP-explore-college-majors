Minutella ""mystery buff""","[4, 5]","Thrilled this season finally has seen a release, but as previously mentioned these episodes are indeed edited; I compared ""Assault on the Tower"" with a previous bootleg copy I had and the first few minutes are missing. It's also sad that neither Shout nor Universal could have thrown a few bucks and restored the print quality, clearly this was done on the cheap and the end result is a washed out, old VHS-quality picture. Why bother releasing a fan favorite show to such a poor quality? I guess that's why the disclaimer ""Episodes mastered from best available video transfer"" is clearly stated on the package. So all in all a disappointing release, but then again it's better than nothing at all.",2,Warning: Edited,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,698,"['Thrilled', 'season', 'finally', 'seen', 'release', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'episodes', 'are', 'indeed', 'edited', 'compared', 'Assault', 'Tower', 'previous', 'bootleg', 'copy', 'had', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'are', 'missing', 'also', 'sad', 'Shout', 'Universal', 'could', 'have', 'thrown', 'few', 'bucks', 'restored', 'print', 'quality', 'clearly', 'was', 'done', 'cheap', 'end', 'result', 'washed', 'out', 'old', 'VHS-quality', 'picture', 'Why', 'bother', 'releasing', 'fan', 'favorite', 'show', 'poor', 'quality', 'guess', 'why', 'disclaimer', 'Episodes', 'mastered', 'best', 'available', 'video', 'transfer', 'clearly', 'stated', 'package', 'disappointing', 'release', 'then', 'again', 'better', 'nothing']",N/A
1605957,A21VCAQLN2YFLU,B00A4Y62JU,"Bo Duke--The Elvis Presley Fan ""Jedi Master""","[1, 2]","Horrendously transferred from ""the best available video""? What happened to the masters in Universal's vault? I don't know. Instead it's transferred from copies of the 3rd season.Don't get me wrong, I am glad to have it, if nothing else, to complete the series collection. Universal could have done better at transferring this season (half a season) to DVD.46 episodes total. The first 14 were as a midseason replacement starting Jan. 30th, 1977. Then a full season starting in Sept., 1977. Finally, the 3rd season lasted only 10 episodes ending on Jan. 14th, 1979. Technically, by 1970s standards of TV seasons only 2. Up until the 1970s the seasons lasted about 30 episodes, then down to the mid-20s per season through the start of the 21st Century.Nothing against the TV series ""The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries"" as a whole. I am glad I have all three seasons (or 2 if going by the then standard of seasons lasting 20-something episodes, but, that may just be the purist part of wanting a season to last a complete season and not be counted as a season if it is a mid-season replacement or last just half a season. That's nitpicking and I won't do that. Just stating an opinion with that.)The last 10 episodes tried to do too much, too soon. Yes, Parker Stevenson (Frank Hardy) and Shaun Cassidy (Joe Hardy) are getting older as are we all. How much longer could they have continued as amateur, teen heartthrob detectives helping out Fenton Hardy? Maybe a few more years. I am disappointed how Glen A. Larson (also producing Battlestar Galactica at the time) decided to pursue the Hardy Boys going in to Season 3. It would have been better if they tried adapting some of the Hardy Boys books, in print at that time, into episodes for the season, it surely wouldn't have hurt any and quite possibly seen the series last in to the early 1980s before Parker and Shaun were ""too old"" or tired of playing the teen heartthrobs. Then they could have tried to pursue the more grownup, ""working for the Justice Dept."" by the, if it had happened, 5th or 6th season (had they been more successful with the 3rd season). But, sadly we will never know.In summation, I am disappointed with the way Season 3 went and turned out (hence ending 2 years after it debuted) and the way they transferred from video instead of the masters (if they still exist), the fact that the 46 episodes add up to just 2 seasons by TV season standards of the time (late 1970s). It could have and should have been done far better than it was (in transfer to DVD, storylines decided on at that time, the direction they took), trying to reach a more ""adult"" (?) audience, or whatever was going on at that time. As a whole it is good to have the entire series. It gives a chance to watch this series from beginning to end at any time. Just know that the entire series is good and enjoyable. But, don't expect Season 3 to be as good as the 2nd Season or 1st.",5,"The Hardy Boys Season 3, it stinks!",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,2922,"['Horrendously', 'transferred', 'best', 'available', 'video', 'What', 'happened', 'masters', 'Universal', 'vault', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Instead', 'transferred', 'copies', '3rd', 'season.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'complete', 'series', 'collection', 'Universal', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'transferring', 'season', 'season', 'DVD.46', 'episodes', 'total', 'first', '14', 'were', 'midseason', 'replacement', 'starting', 'Jan.', '30th', '1977', 'Then', 'full', 'season', 'starting', 'Sept.', '1977', 'Finally', '3rd', 'season', 'lasted', 'only', '10', 'episodes', 'ending', 'Jan.', '14th', '1979', 'Technically', '1970s', 'standards', 'TV', 'seasons', 'only', '2', '1970s', 'seasons', 'lasted', '30', 'episodes', 'then', 'down', 'mid-20s', 'season', 'start', '21st', 'Century.Nothing', 'TV', 'series', 'Hardy', 'Boys/Nancy', 'Drew', 'Mysteries', 'whole', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'three', 'seasons', '2', 'going', 'then', 'standard', 'seasons', 'lasting', '20-something', 'episodes', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'purist', 'part', 'wanting', 'season', 'last', 'complete', 'season', 'not', 'be', 'counted', 'season', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'last', 'just', 'season', 'nitpicking', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'Just', 'stating', 'opinion', 'last', '10', 'episodes', 'tried', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'Yes', 'Parker', 'Stevenson', 'Frank', 'Hardy', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'Joe', 'Hardy', 'are', 'getting', 'older', 'are', 'How', 'much', 'longer', 'could', 'have', 'continued', 'amateur', 'teen', 'heartthrob', 'detectives', 'helping', 'out', 'Fenton', 'Hardy', 'Maybe', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'am', 'disappointed', 'how', 'Glen', 'A.', 'Larson', 'also', 'producing', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'time', 'decided', 'pursue', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'going', 'Season', '3', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'tried', 'adapting', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'books', 'print', 'time', 'episodes', 'season', 'surely', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'hurt', 'quite', 'possibly', 'seen', 'series', 'last', 'early', '1980s', 'Parker', 'Shaun', 'were', 'too', 'old', 'tired', 'playing', 'teen', 'heartthrobs', 'Then', 'could', 'have', 'tried', 'pursue', 'more', 'grownup', 'working', 'Justice', 'Dept', 'had', 'happened', '5th', '6th', 'season', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'successful', '3rd', 'season', 'sadly', 'will', 'never', 'know.In', 'summation', 'am', 'disappointed', 'way', 'Season', '3', 'went', 'turned', 'out', 'hence', 'ending', '2', 'years', 'debuted', 'way', 'transferred', 'video', 'instead', 'masters', 'still', 'exist', 'fact', '46', 'episodes', 'add', 'up', 'just', '2', 'seasons', 'TV', 'season', 'standards', 'time', 'late', '1970s', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'far', 'better', 'was', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'storylines', 'decided', 'time', 'direction', 'took', 'trying', 'reach', 'more', 'adult', 'audience', 'was', 'going', 'time', 'whole', 'good', 'have', 'entire', 'series', 'chance', 'watch', 'series', 'beginning', 'end', 'time', 'Just', 'know', 'entire', 'series', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Season', '3', 'be', 'as', 'good', '2nd', 'Season', '1st']",N/A

Kudos to Shout Factory for releasing The Hardy Boys Season 3.Completionists like myself can finally check off this show as finished. I know Shout Factory put a disclaimer on the package as well before the episodes claiming that the episodes were taken from the best available sources, but I think just a quick pass through some processing filters would have helped The Hardy Boys Season 3. It's obvious Shout Factory did this one on the Cheap, and it's a good thing they are not charging a lot for it, because it is not worth more for the lack of effort put in. There are only 10 episodes in this Season, and if you can stomach your way through the first episode (which is actually a two-parter) the rest of the episodes are typical fare for the Hardy brothers. The first two episodes deal with the death of Joe's fiancee. They are sappy and probably written for the lady Shaun Cassidy fans, they are the weakest written episodes of season. There is a syrupy scene of Joe and his fiancee walking on the beach to a cover of Bread's ""If"" repeated over and over throughout both episodes that is just so cheezy, it almost made me skip to the next episode, but I persevered. Like I said, the other episodes are worth watching. Although the quality isn't great, the episodes are watchable. At times I had turn the volume up, as there was an apparent switch in the source and it became hollow, then the next scene I had to turn it down. Obviously Shout Factory obtained syndicated prints from the so-so quality and cut times on each episode, for that I am only giving this release 3 stars. I'm not sure why they didn't call up Universal and try and get a hold of good quality prints. It seems lately they would rather put out sub-par releases than great ones. I would have paid a few extra bucks to have a DVD that looked as good as the other two seasons.",3,"Video is grainy, flickery and foggy, audio is variable but mostly muddy",1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,1887,"['Well', 'least', 'Season', 'Three', 'out', 'Kudos', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'releasing', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'Season', '3.Completionists', 'can', 'finally', 'check', 'off', 'show', 'finished', 'know', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'put', 'disclaimer', 'package', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'claiming', 'episodes', 'were', 'taken', 'best', 'available', 'sources', 'think', 'just', 'quick', 'pass', 'processing', 'filters', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'Season', '3', 'obvious', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'did', 'one', 'Cheap', 'good', 'thing', 'are', 'not', 'charging', 'lot', 'not', 'worth', 'more', 'lack', 'effort', 'put', 'are', 'only', '10', 'episodes', 'Season', 'can', 'stomach', 'way', 'first', 'episode', 'actually', 'two-parter', 'rest', 'episodes', 'are', 'typical', 'fare', 'Hardy', 'brothers', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'deal', 'death', 'Joe', 'fiancee', 'are', 'sappy', 'probably', 'written', 'lady', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'fans', 'are', 'weakest', 'written', 'episodes', 'season', 'syrupy', 'scene', 'Joe', 'fiancee', 'walking', 'beach', 'cover', 'Bread', 'repeated', 'episodes', 'just', 'so', 'cheezy', 'almost', 'made', 'skip', 'next', 'episode', 'persevered', 'said', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'quality', ""n't"", 'great', 'episodes', 'are', 'watchable', 'times', 'had', 'turn', 'volume', 'up', 'was', 'apparent', 'switch', 'source', 'became', 'hollow', 'then', 'next', 'scene', 'had', 'turn', 'down', 'Obviously', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'obtained', 'syndicated', 'prints', 'so-so', 'quality', 'cut', 'times', 'episode', 'am', 'only', 'giving', 'release', '3', 'stars', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'call', 'up', 'Universal', 'try', 'get', 'hold', 'good', 'quality', 'prints', 'lately', 'would', 'rather', 'put', 'out', 'sub-par', 'releases', 'great', 'ones', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'few', 'extra', 'bucks', 'have', 'DVD', 'looked', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'two', 'seasons']",N/A

In some scenes, Shaun Cassidy was wooden, others overacting, and in yet others he was spot on. Frustrating from a viewers standpoint, as I can barely manage watching his &#34;grief&#34; over losing his wife, but I know there is better acting to come. Parker Stevenson had some episodes where he could shine (Search for Atlantis and Game Plan). And then there were a couple of odd items like &#34;Defection to Paradise&#34;. The plot was interesting and most of the guest cast very good, but while I enjoy David Gates and the band Bread, some singers should stay singers and not actors.All in all, if you are a fan, it's a must have.

The Hardy Boys are brother amateur detectives. Frank is the elder of the two and Joe is a year younger. The two boys live in the fictional city of Bayport, Massachusetts (a change from the book series, which sets Bayport in NY) with their famous father, Fenton Hardy (Ed Gilbert), a private detective who spent &#34;twenty years&#34; with the New York Police Department.In addition to the Hardy Boys, their stories feature two other characters with some regularity: Aunt Gertrude (Edith Atwater) and a platonic female friend of the boys, Callie Shaw (Lisa Eilbacher), who also does part-time work for their father, Fenton. The only other character who played a major part of the Hardy Boys books, Chet Morton (Gary Springer), appeared only briefly in the series and in the third series you don't see hardly any of these other actors except the father occasionally.

1605979,A42GFMF12V7XR,B00A4Y62JU,Paul J. Mular,"[8, 11]","The premier episode of season three, the two-parter ""LAST KISS OF SUMMER (parts 1 & 2)"" almost killed the series right there. Having Joe Hardy in love and getting married to someone we never heard of in the whole previous seasons, and the books this series is supposedly based on, was a real let down for The hardy Boys fans.  Seeing an emotional Joe crying & angry for two hours was too much, for the first time the boys don't work as a team, Joe goes off on his own as a renegade.  It may have been ahead of its time as almost a decade later this story would become the basis for a new paperback Hardy Boys series called The Hardy Boys Casefiles in which Joe's girlfriend Callie is killed in a car explosion.  Joe would become overly emotion in that book and keep his anger through out that book series.  I didn't like that story either.This renegade trend would return in a few more episodes of season three. In ""GAME PLAN"" it is now Frank who is on the verbal attack with Joe and again they seem to be working against each other instead of solving mysteries together. And in ""LIFE ON THE LINE"" the boys still seem to fail to work as a team as a young woman comes between them.There are still some gems here: ""ASSAULT ON THE TOWER"", ""THE SEARCH FOR ATLANTIS"", ""THE SCORPION'S STING"", & ""DEFECTION TO PARADISE (parts 1 & 2)"" are five shows worth getting this set for, they are as good as anything in seasons 1 & 2.  The boys can get interested in a woman, they just shouldn't let it get in the way on an investigation and break apart the team.I do have all 10 on VHS from their 1980's re-run broadcasts and have seen them many times.  So my opinions are not based on anything I read, I saw them. Since I grew up reading the books, my views are also influenced by the original books.By the time THE SCORPION'S STING aired the ratings were so low that several ABC Network affiliates had decided to drop the series and replace it with local programming.  Many fans didn't even know there were 10 episodes in season three as they never saw the later ones.  Even as early as 2001 some on-line episode lists omitted several season three episodes from their listings, convincing many fans that there were only 8 episodes that year. I'm not even sure TV Land aired all 10 episodes of season three, I only caught about 6 episodes there.The bottom line: 5 good episodes, 4 bad episodes, and 1 mediocre episode.  It is worth getting as the price is right, remember that fans paid just as much to get just one episode ""THE SEARCH FOR ATLANTIS"" on VHS tape in the 1980's, now you are getting at least 5 good shows here.",4,"S-3 starts out with a DUD of an episode, but does get better.",1353456000,"11 21, 2012",2012,2608,"['premier', 'episode', 'season', 'three', 'two-parter', 'LAST', 'KISS', 'OF', 'SUMMER', 'parts', '1', '2', 'almost', 'killed', 'series', 'right', 'there', 'Having', 'Joe', 'Hardy', 'love', 'getting', 'married', 'someone', 'never', 'heard', 'whole', 'previous', 'seasons', 'books', 'series', 'supposedly', 'based', 'was', 'real', 'let', 'down', 'hardy', 'Boys', 'fans', 'Seeing', 'emotional', 'Joe', 'crying', 'angry', 'two', 'hours', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'boys', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'team', 'Joe', 'off', 'own', 'renegade', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'ahead', 'time', 'almost', 'decade', 'later', 'story', 'would', 'become', 'basis', 'new', 'paperback', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'series', 'called', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'Casefiles', 'Joe', 'girlfriend', 'Callie', 'killed', 'car', 'explosion', 'Joe', 'would', 'become', 'overly', 'emotion', 'book', 'keep', 'anger', 'book', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'story', 'either.This', 'renegade', 'trend', 'would', 'return', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'season', 'three', 'GAME', 'PLAN', 'now', 'Frank', 'who', 'verbal', 'attack', 'Joe', 'again', 'seem', 'be', 'working', 'other', 'instead', 'solving', 'mysteries', 'together', 'LIFE', 'ON', 'THE', 'LINE', 'boys', 'still', 'seem', 'fail', 'work', 'team', 'young', 'woman', 'are', 'still', 'gems', 'here', 'ASSAULT', 'ON', 'THE', 'TOWER', 'SEARCH', 'FOR', 'ATLANTIS', 'SCORPION', 'STING', 'DEFECTION', 'TO', 'PARADISE', 'parts', '1', '2', 'are', 'five', 'shows', 'getting', 'set', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'boys', 'can', 'get', 'interested', 'woman', 'just', 'should', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'way', 'investigation', 'break', 'apart', 'team.I', 'do', 'have', '10', 'VHS', '1980', 're-run', 'broadcasts', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'opinions', 'are', 'not', 'based', 'anything', 'read', 'saw', 'grew', 'up', 'reading', 'books', 'views', 'are', 'also', 'influenced', 'original', 'time', 'THE', 'SCORPION', 'STING', 'aired', 'ratings', 'were', 'so', 'low', 'several', 'ABC', 'Network', 'affiliates', 'had', 'decided', 'drop', 'series', 'replace', 'local', 'programming', 'Many', 'fans', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'were', '10', 'episodes', 'season', 'three', 'never', 'saw', 'later', 'ones', 'Even', 'as', 'early', '2001', 'on-line', 'episode', 'lists', 'omitted', 'several', 'season', 'three', 'episodes', 'listings', 'convincing', 'many', 'fans', 'were', 'only', '8', 'episodes', 'year', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'TV', 'Land', 'aired', '10', 'episodes', 'season', 'three', 'only', 'caught', '6', 'episodes', 'there.The', 'bottom', 'line', '5', 'good', 'episodes', '4', 'bad', 'episodes', '1', 'mediocre', 'episode', 'worth', 'getting', 'price', 'right', 'remember', 'fans', 'paid', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'get', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'THE', 'SEARCH', 'FOR', 'ATLANTIS', 'VHS', 'tape', '1980', 'now', 'are', 'getting', 'least', '5', 'good', 'shows', 'here']",N/A

But that's what you get in The Hardy Boys: Season Three, a vintage '70s experience. (The show had begun with the Hardys rotating with episodes featuring Nancy Drew, but she was quietly erased for this final season.)Joe Hardy(Shaun Cassidy) and Frank Hardy(Parker Stevenson)whose adventures in crime fighting take a new twist when they're recruited to join their dad as US secret agents. There's a lot of globetrotting involved, although stock-footage establishing shots of London, Greece, Hawaii, etc., take the place of actual location shooting.The 2-part opening episode sees Joe go after the killers of his fianc&eacute;e, a trauma that is mostly forgotten by episode three. The stories are serviceable, but frankly the season is most notable for its cascade of incredible '70s style and its wild gimmicks: government-trained killer sharks at a secret California beach?Bring it on! Stevenson and Cassidy (who enjoyed/endured a phase of teenybopper stardom at this time) boast the kind of hair that belongs in a Smithsonian exhibit on what was notable about the 1970s, and if you remember the soft-rock band ""Bread"", be advised that group leader David Gates and the band are featured in another 2-part episode that features lots of ""Bread"" songs and also Cold War defection espionage (""Bread isn't the only thing on the menu tonight,"" Stevenson notes at a suspense-filled concert).This abbreviated 1978-79 Season lasted only 10 episodes, and given the shoddy production values and the mostly subpar writing, that is no surprise. Future blockbuster screenwriter Steven E. de Souza worked on the series, and the guest cast is the usual collection of '70s regulars:Nehemiah Persoff, Edd ""Kookie"" Byrnes, June Lockhart, Dana Andrews, Dane Clark, etc.Don't go for quality, but if you have a weakness for Smiley Face camp, this does the job.Teen heart-throbs Shaun Cassidy and Parker Stevenson star as brothers Joe and Frank Hardy in the exhilarating final season of the Hardy Boys televison series.Detective duo Frank and Joe decide to turn pro in the final season, going to work for the Justice Department.
