1217709,A1TRRIAA44W5OO,B001MVWMIY,Accen28,"[3, 3]","I gave this movie three stars. It's a funny, light romantic comedy. It's not a great film, but it's cute and lighthearted. The premise is a little different than most lesbian movies. In this one, a straight woman who moved to New York from a small southern town doesn't want to tell her family that her boyfriend is black. Through a series of highly improbable events, everyone in her family thinks she's gay, and her boyfriend is really a woman. So rather than admit the truth when her sister comes for a visit, she ""hires"" a lesbian, played by Cathy DeBuono, to be her fake girlfriend. That's the set up. The humor flows from that. Naturally, she has a gay best friend, with all the obligatory gay jokes. The twist (which I won't spoil for you) is what makes this movie work, and it has to do with stereotypes.",3,"Cute, funny lesbian movie",1351036800,"10 24, 2012",2012,812,"['gave', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'funny', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'cute', 'lighthearted', 'premise', 'little', 'different', 'most', 'lesbian', 'movies', 'one', 'straight', 'woman', 'who', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'small', 'southern', 'town', ""n't"", 'want', 'tell', 'family', 'boyfriend', 'black', 'series', 'highly', 'improbable', 'events', 'everyone', 'family', 'gay', 'boyfriend', 'really', 'woman', 'rather', 'admit', 'truth', 'when', 'sister', 'visit', 'hires', 'lesbian', 'played', 'Cathy', 'DeBuono', 'be', 'fake', 'girlfriend', 'set', 'up', 'humor', 'Naturally', 'gay', 'best', 'friend', 'obligatory', 'gay', 'jokes', 'twist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'what', 'movie', 'work', 'do', 'stereotypes']",Out At The Wedding

Now engaged to Dana (Mystro Clark), a bi-racial airline pilot, Alex fears the reaction her southern family will have to her fianc&eacute;. To bypass this potentially explosive predicament, Alex improvises by telling Dana that all of her family is dead. When her sister Jeannie's (Desi Lydic) wedding comes around, Alex must bring Jonathan as her date. A misunderstanding at the reception however, leads the wedding party to believe that Alex is a lesbian.When Alex can't convince her family that she really is straight, and they embrace her as a lesbian, she leaves well enough alone and returns to New York. Complications arise when Jeannie decides to visit Alex in New York to meet her girlfriend Dana. Rather than tell the truth, Jonathan hatches a plan to ""hire"" a lesbian to act as Alex's girlfriend. However, when Jeanne meets Alex's girlfriend Risa (Cathy DeBuono), sparks fly leading to hilarious and unexpected results. Further confusion arises when Dana's parents show up and Alex must explain how her family has risen from the dead.Director Lee Friedlander, looks at sibling rivalry and relationships, which can often be complicated when we hide the truth from the ones we love. This light-hearted, enjoyable film illustrates the snowball effect that one little white lie can have on a complicated situation.Cathy DeBuono steals the show as sexy girlfriend-for-hire Risa caught in the middle of an outrageous family dilemma.
