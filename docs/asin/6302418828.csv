Will Stockdale (Andy Griffith) is being drafted in the U.S. Air Force. There he makes fiends with new inductee Benjamin B. 'Ben' Whitledge who informs Will that it is the infantry that does the real fighting and that the Air force is just their helpers. So the two of them set out to be transferred to the infantry. We see how simple it is to transfer.No Time for Sergeants brings back all the sights and sound that you are familiar with the military, especially the induction process. They even included the military attitudes. What makes this so funny is the proximity to reality. You have met these people in all walks of life. From Irvin S. Blanchard (Murray Hamilton), who has a bad case of the ROTC.  To Major General Eugene Bush (Howard Smith) that unwittingly gives an inspiring eulogy to (I am not saying).One fun part of watching the movie is not really the movie but recognizing all the actors, some from the original play others look like a retrospect of the ""Andy Griffith Show.""The situations hopefully are not as easily recognized.

311344,A23NJ9AMXSVC6D,6302418828,BerraH,"[0, 0]","We love the Andy Griffith Show and all of the characters from Mayberry! It is a &#34;good&#34; wholesome family show that we can watch without the worry of improper innuendos and suggestive comments that you get with so many other shows! So when we saw that there were other movies that Andy Griffith played in, we were very excited and ordered several of them. I guess we just had the perception that Andy Griffith would have the same values and similar characteristics in all of his movies as he did in his role as Andy Taylor. However, we were disappointed when we found out that he plays roles of people with quite different characteristics in other movies. The roles that he plays in other movies includes characteristics of self-centeredness, pride, arrogance, loud-mouthed, vagrant and a rebel. All of these are basically quite the opposite characteristics of the image that we had developed of Andy Griffith.I guess this move wasn't too bad but the role of the person that Andy Griffith played was that of a backwoods, naive person that had very little &#34;learnin&#34;. Not sure that he had been off the farm very much and his father did not want him to get drafted in the military so he had not ever showed the draft letter to his son. Then he got arrested him as a draft dodger. Once in the service he got into some trouble and was punished by having to clean the latrine but was told it was a privilege and honor. And of course since he was so naive, he believed it. Like I said, I guess this move was OK and there were some pretty funny parts in it.

311351,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6302418828,calvinnme,"[3, 4]","what exactly is the criteria these days for Warner Bros. putting films on DVD versus dumping them into the Warner Archive? In the last year this is one of the very rare pressed classic releases by Warner - or anyone else for that matter -while films that could have been part of a very sellable noir set such as Highway 301, Rancho Notorious, and Nora Prentiss get cheap burn jobs. I just don't get it. But I digress.This is really worth watching for two reasons. It is obviously a blueprint for the popular spin-off TV show ""Gomer Pyle USMC"" starring Jim Nabors in the part played here by Andy Griffith, and it is interesting to make comparisons between the two. Secondly, it really is part of a tribute to the great yet unappreciated range Andy Griffith had as an actor. Here he plays the yokel as well-meaning good guy, anxious to serve his country but just too friendly and green to fully comprehend the discipline he is under in training camp. He  thinks it is an honor when the sergeant gives him latrine duty, and his version of the 21-gun salute when the latrine is inspected is truly hilarious. Watch this and then watch him play the yokel as bad guy in ""A Face in the Crowd"". Fortunately, ""Face in the Crowd"" got a proper release before this burn on demand craze got started. Of course, the long running TV show ""The Andy Griffith Show"" demonstrated that Griffith could play the wise man, being friendly when he could and tough when he had to be as he policed a largely friendly and peace-loving local population with individual residents that could get rowdy and mean as well as the occasional visitor with nefarious intentions.In conclusion, this is a very funny film and deserves to be in the collection of any classic film fan.

Here his Sergeant discovers that he is not only good-natured to a fault, he is also very good at cleaning washrooms, and doesn't resent the chore, so he is designated as PLO --- Permanent Latrine Orderly. When a superior officer learns of this plum assignment, he informs the Sergeant that Stockdale must be properly classified and prepared to ship out with his classmates. Otherwise the Sergeant will get a new assignment --- as PLO.What follows is a continuous serious of hilarious incidents, including the psychiatrist (""do you hate your momma?""), and the eye test (""they was a bunch of strange words, like 'gnixl'""). Perhaps most memorable because of its eventual significance was the first pairing of Andy Griffith and Don Knotts, who is the Manual Dexterity trainer. Asked to solve a simple metal puzzle, Will un-bends then re-bends the pieces, at which the bewildered Knotts wails ""but he did it all wrong!"" This movie is loaded with laughs and sage advice (""the Air Force is like a lake. You're in a canoe, the Colonel is in a canoe, the Captain is in a canoe. You're in the smallest canoe on the whole lake. Don't make waves!"")Broadway stage actor Myron McCormick is Sergeant Orville King, whose well-ordered life in the military is radically upset by the well-intentioned hick from the sticks. McCormick preferred stage acting, but was tempted by the good money into a few movie roles, including as Paul Newman's pool-shark accomplice in the stark drama The Hustler. In No Time for Sergeants his role is strictly for laughs, and he delivers like the true professional he was.From the college comedy circuit, to Broadway with the stage version of No Time for Sergeants and then into the movies, Griffith rose steadily through the ranks of comedians until he achieved virtual immortality with the long-running Andy Griffith Show. His character in No Time for Sergeants is closer to Gomer and Goober Pyle than it is to the Sherriff Andy Taylor who became so familiar to television audiences. In this film you can see the origins of Griffith's lasting fame as a good-old-boy comedian.",5,Andy Griffith Rocks the Boat in the Air Force,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,2188,"['Georgia', 'hillbilly', 'Will', 'Stockdale', 'drafted', 'U.S.', 'Air', 'Force', 'shipped', 'boot', 'camp', 'Here', 'Sergeant', 'discovers', 'not', 'only', 'good-natured', 'fault', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'cleaning', 'washrooms', ""n't"", 'resent', 'chore', 'designated', 'PLO', 'Permanent', 'Latrine', 'Orderly', 'When', 'superior', 'officer', 'learns', 'plum', 'assignment', 'Sergeant', 'Stockdale', 'must', 'be', 'properly', 'classified', 'prepared', 'ship', 'out', 'classmates', 'Otherwise', 'Sergeant', 'will', 'get', 'new', 'assignment', 'PLO.What', 'continuous', 'serious', 'hilarious', 'incidents', 'including', 'psychiatrist', 'do', 'hate', 'momma', 'eye', 'test', 'was', 'bunch', 'strange', 'words', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'eventual', 'significance', 'was', 'first', 'pairing', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'who', 'Manual', 'Dexterity', 'trainer', 'Asked', 'solve', 'simple', 'metal', 'puzzle', 'Will', 'then', 'pieces', 'bewildered', 'Knotts', 'did', 'wrong', 'movie', 'loaded', 'laughs', 'sage', 'advice', 'Air', 'Force', 'lake', ""'re"", 'canoe', 'Colonel', 'canoe', 'Captain', 'canoe', ""'re"", 'smallest', 'canoe', 'whole', 'lake', 'Do', ""n't"", 'make', 'waves', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'actor', 'Myron', 'McCormick', 'Sergeant', 'Orville', 'King', 'well-ordered', 'life', 'military', 'radically', 'upset', 'well-intentioned', 'hick', 'sticks', 'McCormick', 'preferred', 'stage', 'acting', 'was', 'tempted', 'good', 'money', 'few', 'movie', 'roles', 'including', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'pool-shark', 'accomplice', 'stark', 'drama', 'Hustler', 'Time', 'Sergeants', 'role', 'strictly', 'laughs', 'true', 'professional', 'college', 'comedy', 'circuit', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'version', 'Time', 'Sergeants', 'then', 'movies', 'Griffith', 'rose', 'steadily', 'ranks', 'comedians', 'achieved', 'virtual', 'immortality', 'long-running', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'character', 'Time', 'Sergeants', 'closer', 'Gomer', 'Goober', 'Pyle', 'Sherriff', 'Andy', 'Taylor', 'who', 'became', 'so', 'familiar', 'television', 'audiences', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'origins', 'Griffith', 'lasting', 'fame', 'good-old-boy', 'comedian']",No Time for Sergeants VHS

However, I really appreciate a solid comedy probably more than anything else simply because there are so few great ones out of the many, many comedies made. Don't get me wrong, there are a bunch of good comedies out there, one's that have one or two great moments, but to be a true classic there has to be at least one laugh out loud moment and at least several other very clever quips.To me classic comedies include this, Four Rooms, A Night at the Opera, Duck Soup, Slapshot, Way Out West, Get Shorty, Big Man on Campus, Dr. Strangelove...well, you get the idea if you're a comedy fan.It absolutely astounds me more people haven't seen this movie.  In my opinion, this has the funniest scene in any movie ever.  There are several laugh out loud moments in this one scene...almost unheard of and there are a few other gems in the rest of the film as well.If you enjoy comedies and have never seen this film, you my friend, are in for the treat of your life.

There is also an interview with Andy Griffith explaining how as a night club talking comic he auditioned for the Broadway stage play production and almost failed.  The auditioners thought that his appearance and accent were acceptable but then, well, they just didn't know....  so they asked Andy to wait in the office while a few other applicants were evaluated.  In the office a secretary asked Andy what he did so in explaination he went into one of his night club monologues for her.  Passers by heard the goings on and stopped their activities to watch also.  Shortly the passageway was blocked with an impromptu audience.  This so impressed the auditioner that Andy got the part.The broadway play was seen by another talent scout that decided to put the play on tv resulting in THIS presentation.

This early one from Andy Griffith was a 180 degree swing from his debut film (A Face In The Crowd) and afforded him a chance to begin honing his down home comedic stylings (already a hit in comedy albums - who can forget 'what it was...was football' or 'Romeo & Juliet)that he would later bring to perfection in The Andy Griffith Show.  It truly is a comic gem and a great family film.  His supporting cast (a surprising Nick Adams exhibiting light comedic timing that he would never again display and the incomparable Myron McCormick who manages to be as sullen faced as a Bassett Hound and hysterically funny at the same time) ably frame the country bumpkin with a heart of gold and common sense to boot.  Andy Griffith has kept a sly eye on his audience and show business itself ever since and is one of this country's unsung National Treasures.

In it, Andy Griffith created the character who has been basically the same guy in three different settings. He started out in ""Sergeants"" as Private Will Stockdale, a lovably doofy Air Force enlisted man. The Most Famous Hillbilly In the World changed his name in the 1960's for the small screen as Sheriff Andy Taylor in ""The Andy Griffith Show"", and he was still the same guy in a different uniform. As a footnote, that series also kicked off the career of Ron Howard, the most unpretentious brilliant movie director who ever lived. Anyway, Stockdale/ Taylor morphed into an unlikely Atlanta lawyer named Ben Matlock. But as Bob Seger might have said, he was still the same. How do you take the same personna and keep it going, with only name and wardrobe changes? Here's a secret--it's necessary for your name to be Andy Griffith. Ignore all the other posts here who confuse him with Jim Nabors and Gomer Pyle. This is the original model--""...thuh best danged private in the whole danged Air Force.""

This film is simply hilarious from start to finish, chronicling the the life and times of Will Stockdale (Andy Griffith) as a backwoods inductee in the U.S. Air Force.  This film set the tone for later efforts in a similar vein such as ""Gomer Pyle USMC"" but this one comes across as more genuine and even funnier.  The ""upsetting of dignity"" concept is played to perfection in this film by Andy Griffith. Second Lead Myron McCormick as Sgt. King comes across as a truly pathetic soul with lots of human frailties rather than the typically overbearing Sergeants you seen in most movies or TV Shows.Also look for Don Knotts in a small but memorable role opposite Griffith in what I beleive was their first on-screen pairing.
