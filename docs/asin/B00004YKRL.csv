There is no storyline here, no evolution of drama, no escalation of conflict, no central characters, no resolution.  It comes off partially as a documentary, but as others have noted, it is filmed in such a surrealistic way it can not be called a documentary at all.  There are long and lingering shots of nothing of interest, perhaps meant to add tone or mood to the film, but to what point?  There is a sunset shot over water, land, and clouds that is repeated a number of times to convey the passing of time??? but it's the same cloud everyday!That being said, the range of responses by Amazon viewers show that some deeply appreciate the film, some see a bit of value in it, while others find it mostly untenable.  Some in their reviews have shared insights into eastern European culture and into Russian/Soviet military life which helped me to understand some aspects of this film.  But overall the film fails to successfully convey its point.  Whether you like this film or not will be entirely dependent on your own tastes, but it is an unconventional portrayal that made little sense to me.",1,Uncaptivating,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,1152,"['warning', 'future', 'viewers', 'film', 'PLOTLESS', 'storyline', 'here', 'evolution', 'drama', 'escalation', 'conflict', 'central', 'characters', 'resolution', 'off', 'partially', 'documentary', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'filmed', 'such', 'surrealistic', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'called', 'documentary', 'are', 'long', 'lingering', 'shots', 'nothing', 'interest', 'perhaps', 'meant', 'add', 'tone', 'mood', 'film', 'what', 'point', 'sunset', 'shot', 'water', 'land', 'clouds', 'repeated', 'number', 'times', 'convey', 'passing', 'time', 'same', 'cloud', 'everyday', 'being', 'said', 'range', 'responses', 'Amazon', 'viewers', 'show', 'deeply', 'appreciate', 'film', 'see', 'bit', 'value', 'others', 'find', 'mostly', 'untenable', 'reviews', 'have', 'shared', 'insights', 'eastern', 'European', 'culture', 'Russian/Soviet', 'military', 'life', 'helped', 'understand', 'aspects', 'film', 'overall', 'film', 'successfully', 'convey', 'point', 'film', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'entirely', 'dependent', 'own', 'tastes', 'unconventional', 'portrayal', 'made', 'little', 'sense']",N/A

559350,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00004YKRL,Grady Harp,"[10, 12]","At this moment in our history we need all the input about the multiple facets of the hideous War Machine that has an apparent strangle hold on every country on the planet.  In this Russian meditation, 100 DAYS BEFORE THE COMMAND, we are shown the behind-locked-doors view of youth preparing to become soldiers and leaders of soldiers.  On the surface the director's eye seems to be telling us that 'boot camp' for these VERY young appearing boys is no more than a summer camp experience.  But then he gradually shows the darker, terrifying side of what preparing these innocents for war produces - suffering, self-doubt, death, alienating behaviour, dreams and nightmares.  There is an incredible sense of innocence in the eyes of these youth, and a groping for comradery that lightly brushes on eroticism.  The multiple nude scenes seem to be offending more people than the Russian censors, but they are some of the more tender and tangible scenes in this meandering film about questioning our place and mindsets in the propagation of war leaders.  Of note, in this very Russian film, the music used in the background is all Bach - excerpts form the Passions, cantatas - instead of works by Russian composers.  This adds another dimension to this apparent 'paean' for world peace.  This film is not for everyone, especially not for those who still have difficulty with male nudity.........",4,A timely meditation on the absurdity of war,1045267200,"02 15, 2003",2003,1390,"['moment', 'history', 'need', 'input', 'multiple', 'facets', 'hideous', 'War', 'Machine', 'apparent', 'strangle', 'hold', 'country', 'planet', 'Russian', 'meditation', '100', 'DAYS', 'THE', 'COMMAND', 'are', 'shown', 'behind-locked-doors', 'view', 'youth', 'preparing', 'become', 'soldiers', 'leaders', 'soldiers', 'surface', 'director', 'eye', 'be', 'telling', 'camp', 'VERY', 'young', 'appearing', 'boys', 'more', 'summer', 'camp', 'experience', 'then', 'gradually', 'darker', 'terrifying', 'side', 'what', 'preparing', 'innocents', 'war', 'suffering', 'self-doubt', 'death', 'alienating', 'behaviour', 'dreams', 'nightmares', 'incredible', 'sense', 'innocence', 'eyes', 'youth', 'groping', 'comradery', 'lightly', 'eroticism', 'multiple', 'nude', 'scenes', 'seem', 'be', 'offending', 'more', 'people', 'Russian', 'censors', 'are', 'more', 'tender', 'tangible', 'scenes', 'meandering', 'film', 'questioning', 'place', 'mindsets', 'propagation', 'war', 'leaders', 'note', 'very', 'Russian', 'film', 'music', 'used', 'background', 'Bach', 'excerpts', 'form', 'Passions', 'cantatas', 'instead', 'works', 'Russian', 'composers', 'dimension', 'apparent', 'world', 'peace', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'especially', 'not', 'who', 'still', 'have', 'difficulty', 'male', 'nudity']",N/A
559351,A3CPCOKUEYQ37,B00004YKRL,John Gosset,"[0, 0]",This film is an odd mixture of feature film and pornography. It never seems to be able to make up its mind which it is.

559353,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B00004YKRL,PJR,"[0, 0]","This film seemed really dated stylistically, like a lot of the amateurish art films of the 50s and 60s. It was sort of a pastiche of moody scenes that did not have much to do with each other except setting in some sort of military training facility. The dominant feeling was of emptiness and lack of meaning and of meaningful interpersonal interactions. If this was supposed to be a metaphor of life in Russia from a certain point of view, then maybe it was pretty good. But a Russian would have to judge that, not an American like myself.I have a lot of trouble seeing all the political implications that some reviewers seem sure are there. Actually that is why I picked up the film, because of those reviews. I did not see it as so much about communism but Russia. Life must have been pretty bleak under the Czar as well, or they would not have revolted. It probably is not so great now. Frankly I was wondering if the stories about rampant alcoholism among Russians are not probably true. The film made it very easy to suppose they are. I even wondered if the director was a depressed alcoholic. And yes, as others have pointed out the film quality and sound are uneven. And yes it is hard to see any eroticism in this film. A lot of nude guys and one women does not add up to eroticism. If anything it was anti-erotic. There was no spark of bonding or buddy-ness between the guys even when they were naked together or washing each other. All that flesh and no connections of any sort. The girl was sexual with one guy, but that was light and brief and hardly charged the film erotically.On the other hand I give this a three star instead of a one, because if one had the patience it did a good job of conveying a mood of emptiness and disconnection. It did a fair job of conveying a feeling of living under the watchful eye.If you take it as a series of moody paintings or still photographs  instead of a film then perhaps you can find something to admire, as I did. It brought the photographer in me to the surface, and gave me some ideas. While the shots were not &#34;great&#34; in my opinion they were effective -- again if you looked at them as a series of moody paintings/photographs upon which to meditate. They would not be out of place in a modern museum, not because of technical brilliance, but because of effective mood communication.And, its kind of interesting to see the variety of films that are being done in Russia.",3,"interesting, but crummy as film",1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,2437,"['film', 'seemed', 'really', 'dated', 'stylistically', 'lot', 'amateurish', 'art', 'films', '50s', '60s', 'was', 'sort', 'pastiche', 'moody', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'other', 'setting', 'sort', 'military', 'training', 'facility', 'dominant', 'feeling', 'was', 'emptiness', 'lack', 'meaning', 'meaningful', 'interpersonal', 'interactions', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'metaphor', 'life', 'Russia', 'certain', 'point', 'view', 'then', 'maybe', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Russian', 'would', 'have', 'judge', 'not', 'American', 'myself.I', 'have', 'lot', 'trouble', 'seeing', 'political', 'implications', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'sure', 'are', 'there', 'Actually', 'why', 'picked', 'up', 'film', 'reviews', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'communism', 'Russia', 'Life', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'bleak', 'Czar', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'revolted', 'probably', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'now', 'Frankly', 'was', 'wondering', 'stories', 'rampant', 'alcoholism', 'Russians', 'are', 'not', 'probably', 'true', 'film', 'made', 'very', 'easy', 'suppose', 'are', 'even', 'wondered', 'director', 'was', 'depressed', 'alcoholic', 'yes', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'film', 'quality', 'sound', 'are', 'uneven', 'yes', 'hard', 'see', 'eroticism', 'film', 'lot', 'nude', 'guys', 'one', 'women', 'not', 'add', 'up', 'eroticism', 'anything', 'was', 'anti-erotic', 'was', 'spark', 'bonding', 'buddy-ness', 'guys', 'even', 'when', 'were', 'naked', 'together', 'washing', 'other', 'flesh', 'connections', 'sort', 'girl', 'was', 'sexual', 'one', 'guy', 'was', 'light', 'brief', 'hardly', 'charged', 'film', 'erotically.On', 'other', 'hand', 'give', 'three', 'star', 'instead', 'one', 'one', 'had', 'patience', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'conveying', 'mood', 'emptiness', 'disconnection', 'did', 'fair', 'job', 'conveying', 'feeling', 'living', 'watchful', 'eye.If', 'take', 'series', 'moody', 'paintings', 'still', 'photographs', 'instead', 'film', 'then', 'perhaps', 'can', 'find', 'something', 'admire', 'did', 'brought', 'photographer', 'surface', 'gave', 'ideas', 'shots', 'were', 'not', '34', 'great', '34', 'opinion', 'were', 'effective', 'again', 'looked', 'series', 'moody', 'paintings/photographs', 'meditate', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'place', 'modern', 'museum', 'not', 'technical', 'brilliance', 'effective', 'mood', 'communication.And', 'kind', 'interesting', 'see', 'variety', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'done', 'Russia']",N/A
