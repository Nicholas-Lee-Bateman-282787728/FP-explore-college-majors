1207963,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B001KGDNBG,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[5, 5]","The LUCY AND DESI: A HOME MOVIE is a wonderful documentary, directed by daughter Lucie Arnaz, and shows color home movies of the famous television couple as newlyweds, during the ""I Love Lucy"" run, and even as seniors citizens long after their divorce. It also shows other family members and has interviews with family and friends, and includes clips from both their respective movie careers.One serious flaw in this production is the sound quality on some of the interviews. I'm not talking about sound bites taken from old interviews or television appearances by Ball or Arnaz, which cannot be helped, the sound issues present are on some of the then current interviews with friends and family members. Some voices are muffled to the point that it's very hard to understand what the person is saying. It's like someone forgot to take the cap off the microphone or something.I'm almost deducted two-stars because of this. It's not on all the interviewees, just on some, so it's not terrible throughout, but someone really dropped the ball on this one. It's a shame because it really seems like a labor of love for Lucie Arnaz to uncover and share some of the most private home movies with the fans, not to mention the interviews that both Ball and Arnaz did on shows like on Johnny Carson and other talk shows so you get their side of the story as well.Luckily there are captions, so you can turn them on to understand what is being said. Still, it's a glaring error and I'm surprised that it wasn't caught in time before being shipped out on DVD.It's funny because the extras on the DVD do not suffer from this problem, so it must have been an issue when they tapped the interviews themselves.Anyway, the special features on the DVD are plentiful:******  DVD EXTRAS  ******INTERVIEW WITH LUCIE & DESI, JR. ARNAZ - 31:09-minutes - Unedited interview with Desi, Jr. & Lucie about growing up in Hollywood, etc. Desi, Jr. tends to ramble but it does give one insight into what it was like growing up with the famous TV couple.OUT TAKES - 20:33 - These are out-takes and bloopers from the making of this documentary and not of ""I Love Lucy."" There are also other stories presented here as well that didn't make the final cut.LUCY & DESI COMMERCIALS - 12:51-minutesVarious commercials for Westinghouse that feature Ball and Arnaz as ""Lucy"" and ""Ricky,"" along with Vivian Vance and William Frawley as ""Ethel"" and ""Fred"" and Keith Thibodeaux as ""Little Ricky."" These must have been done for the Christmas season and I enjoyed watching these. The picture and sound is pristine.HERE'S LUCY PROMO - 02:03-minutesPromo for the DVD sets.WHAT'S MY LINE 1955 - 09:16-minutesOld TV show with Lucy & Desi as the ""mystery guests"" were the panel try and guess who it is.I'VE GOT A SECRET 1956 - 23:49-minutesCelebrity panel including Lucy and they try and guess what the secret is. Desi makes an appearance, too. This is funny because the contestants get some prize money and a carton of cigarettes, LOL. Oh how times have changed!Anyway, aside from the sound issue, the DVD is well worth it for Lucy fans.

1207964,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B001KGDNBG,Annie Van Auken,"[15, 16]","LUCY AND DESI: A HOME MOVIE first aired on CBS-TV on Valentine's Day, 1993. As stated at the outset of this Emmy-winning documentary, it was an answer from family and friends of the famous couple to a 1991 TV movie expos&eacute; entitled:LUCY & DESI: BEFORE THE LAUGHTER.  (VHS only)Factually correct, this tribute glosses over only a couple of points:Desi's womanizing is dismissed as part of Cuban culture, besides, he couldn't help himself-- those girls threw themselves at him (yah sure).Lucy's relationship with Vivian Vance is described as loving and sisterly. Maybe so in later years, but during the run ofI LOVE LUCYVance highly resented that she was forced to look dowdy and decades older than the show's star, when in fact there was only a two year difference in their ages.The program is hosted by daughter Lucie and features commentary from Desi Jr., Gale Gordon (still vital in his late-80s), Van Johnson, Ann Miller, scripters Bob Weiskopf, Bob Schiller, Bob Carroll Jr. and Madelyn Davis, Jackie Cooper and author/editor James Bacon. Contributing family members include Lucy's brother Fred and her cousin Cleo Morgan.Highlighted are many clips of beautifully-preserved full color home movies, plus scenes from pictures that Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz appeared in, both individually and as a team. They're younger in their privately-shot films than they are during the TV show years, and so obviously in love. These marvelous glimpses (courtesy of the Arnaz kids), plus the personal recollections make a for fine Valentine card to America's all-time favorite TV couple.Recommended to all!",5,"""I love Lucy and she loves me...""",1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,1603,"['LUCY', 'DESI', 'HOME', 'MOVIE', 'first', 'aired', 'CBS-TV', 'Valentine', 'Day', '1993', 'stated', 'outset', 'Emmy-winning', 'documentary', 'was', 'answer', 'family', 'friends', 'famous', 'couple', '1991', 'TV', 'movie', 'expos', 'eacute', 'entitled', 'LUCY', 'DESI', 'LAUGHTER', 'VHS', 'only', 'Factually', 'correct', 'tribute', 'only', 'couple', 'points', 'Desi', 'womanizing', 'dismissed', 'part', 'Cuban', 'culture', 'besides', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'girls', 'threw', 'sure', '.Lucy', 'relationship', 'Vivian', 'Vance', 'described', 'loving', 'sisterly', 'Maybe', 'so', 'later', 'years', 'run', 'ofI', 'LOVE', 'LUCYVance', 'highly', 'resented', 'was', 'forced', 'look', 'dowdy', 'decades', 'older', 'show', 'star', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'only', 'two', 'year', 'difference', 'ages.The', 'program', 'hosted', 'daughter', 'Lucie', 'features', 'commentary', 'Desi', 'Jr.', 'Gale', 'Gordon', 'still', 'vital', 'late-80s', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'scripters', 'Bob', 'Weiskopf', 'Bob', 'Schiller', 'Bob', 'Carroll', 'Jr.', 'Madelyn', 'Davis', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'author/editor', 'James', 'Bacon', 'Contributing', 'family', 'members', 'include', 'Lucy', 'brother', 'Fred', 'cousin', 'Cleo', 'Morgan.Highlighted', 'are', 'many', 'clips', 'beautifully-preserved', 'full', 'color', 'home', 'movies', 'scenes', 'pictures', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Desi', 'Arnaz', 'appeared', 'individually', 'team', ""'re"", 'younger', 'privately-shot', 'films', 'are', 'TV', 'show', 'years', 'so', 'obviously', 'love', 'marvelous', 'glimpses', 'courtesy', 'Arnaz', 'kids', 'personal', 'recollections', 'make', 'fine', 'Valentine', 'card', 'America', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'TV', 'couple.Recommended']",N/A

As Lucie Arnaz points out, we got the show but they lost each other.Toward the end of this wonderful video, a family member asks, ""What were you afraid of, Lucille?""  It tears her apart to blurt out that question, and when I heard it, I knew it was the truth - what frightened her so much?The story of this marriage I consider one of the greatest love stories of the 20th century, right up there with Scott and Zelda and Maria and Onassis.

1207966,A1BMQA5PIZKU1P,B001KGDNBG,"Bryan ""Dragonboots""","[8, 10]","The most interesting thing on this DVD, to me, is in the bonus features.  There is a game show called 'I've got a secret' that Lucy is on.  The show has a guest who has a secret and must answers questions from the celebrity panel.  The guest whispers in the ear of the host the secret, to which they display on the screen(or something along the lines of): 'witnessed the assassination of President Lincoln.'  This show was in the mid 1950's and this man is in his late 90's.  He was 5 years old when he witnessed the assassination.  After the panel had guessed who he is, the old man said that as a kid he was concerned about the guy who fell from the balcony.  Obviously he did not know about the President being shot as John Wilkes Booth jumped from the balcony to escape!Oh yeah, the rest of the dvd, that has Lucy and Desi on it: Very good, very interesting.  A lot of pictures and home videos and more than I thought it would be when I bought it.  A lot of interviews from family members, including thier 2 kids who made this documentary, and celebrities(Lucy's brother, neice & cousins are on here).  There are a ton of bonus features:  Lucy & Desi commercials for kitchen appliances that are not on the I Love Lucy or Lucy-Desi comedy hour DVDs), appearances on game shows, photo gallery, etc.  The only real dissapointment for me was the often muddled sound of, well, EVERYTHING since its all so old.  But I did not expect the documentary, made in the mid 1990's, to sound that way.  Unfortunately it does.  It sounds like someone ran a VHS copy off and put it on the DVD with no effort to improve the sound.  However, this DVD is worth buying.

This is a two-hour documentary (originally aired on NBC-TV in the mid 1990's) on their lives, careers, and bittersweet love story.  Many of the duo's relatives, friends and associates are interviewed (some of them famous, such as Ann Miller, Van Johnson, Bob Hope, Gale Gordon, and Jackie Cooper) but the undeniable highlight is clips from Lucy and Desi's personal home movie collections over the decades, including ones as early as the early 1940's and in color no less!! This dvd is essential for any I LOVE LUCY fan and won a well-deserved Emmy.  Lucie Arnaz discusses her parents thoroughout the film (her younger brother, Desi Arnaz Jr., somewhat less so) and at times the film seems harder on her mother than her father (Lucie recalls several rather unflattering memories of Lucy but what is negative about Desi is not coming from her lips).  As she notes, nobody (well, hardly anybody) has a ""Father Knows Best"" sugar-coated existance.  I enjoyed the documentary and there are many touching moments (again most of this the candid film footage, including the closing moments of Lucy and Desi reunited in the swimming pool with Lucie's firstborn baby in the 1980's).  One thing I would have liked would have been for the dvd's ""bonus features"" to have included additional footage from the home movies, instead we get interview comments that didn't make it into the final edit of the show still every Lucy fan/collector should own a copy of this dvd to go along with their series' season sets and movies.",5,EXCELLENT LUCILLE BALL-DESI ARNAZ DOCUMENTARY BY DAUGHTER LUCIE,1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,1722,"['LUCY', 'DESI', 'HOME', 'MOVIE', 'intimate', 'documentary', 'American', 'tv', 'still', 'most', 'famous', 'couple', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Desi', 'Arnaz', 'was', 'produced', 'daughter', 'Lucie', 'Arnaz', 'husband', 'Laurence', 'Luckinbill', 'two-hour', 'documentary', 'originally', 'aired', 'NBC-TV', 'mid', '1990', 'lives', 'careers', 'bittersweet', 'love', 'story', 'Many', 'duo', 'relatives', 'friends', 'associates', 'are', 'interviewed', 'famous', 'such', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Gale', 'Gordon', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'undeniable', 'highlight', 'clips', 'Lucy', 'Desi', 'personal', 'home', 'movie', 'collections', 'decades', 'including', 'ones', 'as', 'early', 'early', '1940', 'color', 'less', 'dvd', 'essential', 'LOVE', 'LUCY', 'fan', 'won', 'well-deserved', 'Emmy', 'Lucie', 'Arnaz', 'parents', 'film', 'younger', 'brother', 'Desi', 'Arnaz', 'Jr.', 'somewhat', 'less', 'so', 'times', 'film', 'harder', 'mother', 'father', 'Lucie', 'several', 'rather', 'unflattering', 'memories', 'Lucy', 'what', 'negative', 'Desi', 'not', 'coming', 'lips', 'nobody', 'well', 'hardly', 'anybody', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'sugar-coated', 'existance', 'enjoyed', 'documentary', 'are', 'many', 'touching', 'moments', 'again', 'most', 'candid', 'film', 'footage', 'including', 'closing', 'moments', 'Lucy', 'Desi', 'reunited', 'swimming', 'pool', 'Lucie', 'firstborn', 'baby', '1980', 'One', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'dvd', 'bonus', 'features', 'have', 'included', 'additional', 'footage', 'home', 'movies', 'instead', 'get', 'interview', 'comments', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'final', 'edit', 'show', 'still', 'Lucy', 'fan/collector', 'should', 'own', 'copy', 'dvd', 'go', 'along', 'series', 'season', 'sets', 'movies']",N/A

It illustrates how poignant their lives were, and the price they paid for making American television history. This could make one cry, and really is a home movie with narration, interviews, and bonuses.I give the content of this DVD 5 stars, however, I give the sound 3 stars.  The sound is contrasty on some of the interviews only, but I'm not sure that it is the fault of the production or the lack of vocal projection of the interviewee.  Words came through enough to get the gist of what was being communicated, but some words of the sentences were muffled, and I found myself backtracking in spots, turning the volume up to hear what was said.  This could be related to the Samsung blu-ray player I used, so don't let this stop you from getting this wonderful DVD.  I've noticed some of my blu-ray discs do the same thing.  I didn't have this problem with the sound on the I Love Lucy complete series, of which I just finished a five week marathon before watching this DVD.The images are fantastic, and the 5 bonus Westinghouse promotions they hosted are a phenomenal trip into that era.  The two bonus game show appearances they made are not just cuts, but the full episodes of What's My Line, and I've Got A Secret.  Why these weren't included on the complete series DVDs, I'll never know.

1207981,AI7KBBGYYCFX6,B001KGDNBG,W. Budris,"[30, 31]","When I originally saw the initial broadcast of this great program on Lucy & Desi, it put the crown on the truth. Their lives are presented to us with absolute love and affection by Lucie Arnaz's direction, her commentary, as well as commentary by Desi Arnaz, Jr, Fred Ball, family and friends both personal and professional.  This is the ultimate Lucy and Desi story from those in the know.  I've worn out my VHS copy when I need a refresher.  Glad it is on DVD in pristine quality.  The ""blooper"" bonus is worth the price alone.  I hadn't laughed so hard in a long time.  Other bonuses included are several end-of-show commercials for Westinghouse products by the cast of the later Lucy-Desi Hour specials (those that would fit in after final announcements, etc in the bonus features of ""I Love Lucy, Seasons 7-8-9"").  What I call an ""extra taste"" is the ""Here's Lucy"" promo, which I thought before I pressed play was a commercial used to promote the show on CBS.  Lo and behold, it was a long promo indicating that MPI will put out all six seasons of ""Here's Lucy"" in the future, plus the Lucille Ball Specials from 1974-80 that followed this series, and haven't been seen since original broadcast on CBS.  I was flabbergasted, especially when I didn't see the second special with Dean Martin called ""Lucy Goes To Vegas"".  The promo also shows beautiful picture and sound for all snipets of the episodes represented.  Cannot wait until these come out.  Will ""The Lucy Show"" and ""Life With Lucy"" soon follow?  I sure hope so.
