1315116,ANR0SXIOP79QT,B0030BS1FM,"Joan H. Laurino ""Joanie At Large""","[2, 2]","National Geographic's ""Drain The Ocean"" is an outstanding documentary! As a science buff, I never saw anything like it before.  For the first time, computer images show you what the earth would like if there were no oceans.  The computer images look real; for instance, the scientists walking around the famous ""smokers"" or standing on the edge of a cliff, hundreds of feet down below the shoreline and a plane flying thousands of feet even further!  The science involved in this is remarkable documentary gives you a full love and appreciation of our oceans, for without them, life on Earth would not be at least desirable.

Beautiful photography, interviews with scientists/explorers, and stunning computer-generated imagery, render some justice to a world that still needs to deliver many secrets to humanity.

1315120,A1QQ5KV3E6IRFP,B0030BS1FM,SteelersFan,"[10, 23]",After reading the other reviews here I was hopeful and excited to see this.  I was really looking for something to show my intro geology classes regarding the sea floor and all of the interesting areas and details of it.  Boy was I disappointed.  I found the overall presentation very dry and convoluted.  The graphics are nice but they are not shown with the greatest impact.  Out of the 90 minutes of video I may use about 12-20 minutes of it.  There are much better videos out there that do a much better job at giving the science of what is going on in different locations of our sea floor.  I feel they just got too overdramatic with the information and too caught up in the CGI graphics and didn't give good easy to follow information.  I'm sure this will appeal to certain audiences but it really didn't appeal to me or hit what I wanted to use it for.  I am disappointed with what I think they could have done which would have been to couple the amazing graphics with straight forward easy to follow science.,1,Disappointing,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,1016,"['reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'was', 'hopeful', 'excited', 'see', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'something', 'show', 'intro', 'geology', 'classes', 'regarding', 'sea', 'floor', 'interesting', 'areas', 'details', 'Boy', 'was', 'disappointed', 'found', 'overall', 'presentation', 'very', 'dry', 'convoluted', 'graphics', 'are', 'nice', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'greatest', 'impact', '90', 'minutes', 'video', 'may', 'use', '12-20', 'minutes', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'videos', 'there', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'giving', 'science', 'what', 'going', 'different', 'locations', 'sea', 'floor', 'feel', 'just', 'got', 'too', 'overdramatic', 'information', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'CGI', 'graphics', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'good', 'easy', 'follow', 'information', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'appeal', 'certain', 'audiences', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'hit', 'what', 'wanted', 'use', 'am', 'disappointed', 'what', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'couple', 'amazing', 'graphics', 'straight', 'forward', 'easy', 'follow', 'science']",National Geographic: Drain the Ocean
