I put his various tracks on audio DVDs and listen to them in random order all day. I even had a bumper sticker made that says ""Van Morrison-Anything Else Is Just Noise"". That said, I was disappointed in this DVD. To me it just doesn't give the impression of a true capture of the concert. Yes, the audio does it justice but the video leaves a lot to be desired in that it doesn't seem to match up the the audio. It's like the audio was recorded and edited and then tried to be matched up to the video. That's the best way I can explain it. Also, the quick cuts from one shot to the next are very irritating.

But over the last 20 years his output has not been as consistent as this stunningly beautiful performance. In my opinion, the original Astral Weeks recording is one of the great records of all time. Its cohesion, flawless musicianship, stunning vocals, and erotic poetry outstrips other contemporary luminaries. When you think of what was happening in 1968, that's saying something. I never expected to hear anything like that again. I wasn't even sure that Morrison, himself, could still deliver this kind of beauty. Perhaps I'd lost my faith. Well, this video has restored it in spades. The pleasure of hearing this in 5.1 Surround Sound was worth the wait. When I die, I hope whoever is around will care enough to put this video of live Astral Weeks on whatever they're showing video on at that point, so I can recall the pleasures of my life to its natural sound track as I seek my ""home on high.""",5,I believe I've transcended,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,1024,"['probably', 'most', 'spectacular', 'come', 'back', 'lifetime', 'Not', 'Van', 'Morrison', 'actually', 'been', 'away', 'anywhere', 'last', '20', 'years', 'output', 'not', 'been', 'as', 'consistent', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'opinion', 'original', 'Astral', 'Weeks', 'recording', 'one', 'great', 'records', 'time', 'cohesion', 'flawless', 'musicianship', 'stunning', 'vocals', 'erotic', 'poetry', 'other', 'contemporary', 'luminaries', 'When', 'think', 'what', 'was', 'happening', '1968', 'saying', 'something', 'never', 'expected', 'hear', 'anything', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'sure', 'Morrison', 'could', 'still', 'deliver', 'kind', 'beauty', 'Perhaps', ""'d"", 'lost', 'faith', 'Well', 'video', 'restored', 'spades', 'pleasure', 'hearing', '5.1', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'was', 'wait', 'When', 'die', 'hope', 'whoever', 'around', 'will', 'care', 'enough', 'put', 'video', 'live', 'Astral', 'Weeks', ""'re"", 'showing', 'video', 'point', 'can', 'recall', 'pleasures', 'life', 'natural', 'sound', 'track', 'seek', 'home', 'high']",N/A

The videography was transparent or it was scintillating. Van was on his game or he wasn't. No middle ground!As for me, I only expected to see him perform these great tunes from Astral Weeks and I wasn't disappointed at all. In short, he delivered the goods.Van (being interviewed) is cordial with a thick Irish brogue that one never hears when he is singing. And what a voice....mellowed like fine brandy with an occasional ""aargh"" thrown in for good measure.The band is superb especially the fellow on bari sax, flute and soprano sax who is able to match the mimicry of Van with his instrument on ""Common One.""Morrison plays mouth harp, acoustic and electric guitar and piano with verve and a bluesy/jazzy feel. The violins are fantastic but it is the rock solid bass of David Hayes that is outstanding (both acoustic and electric bass)In short, this is a terrific DVD showcasing the most talented performer we have left since the passing of Ray Charles.
