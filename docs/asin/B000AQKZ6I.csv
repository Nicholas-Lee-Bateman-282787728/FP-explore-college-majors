The first CD I purchased by Candy Dulfer was ""Sax A Go Go"" . I now have seven of Candy's CDs. Number eight is on the way. Her music is so good.  I don't have to hear a single song to make a purchase. Hearing her is GOOD. To hear and see her doing her thing is GREAT. Once she started performing ""Sax A Go-Go"", I repeated it at least three times before I continued watching the concert.

931367,A3S5C7Y0WT2Q9N,B000AQKZ6I,J. Lizzi,"[18, 18]","This is essentially a compilation of two Candy Dulfer appearances at the Montreaux Jazz Festival:  the featured show from July of 2002, and the bonus performance from July of 1998.  Both took place at the famed Auditorium Stravinsky and were filmed for television.  I consider Candy to be the funkiest white chick on the planet, taking over that distinction from Teena Marie, and her jammin' sax tunes have impressed me since ""Sax-A-Go-Go"" came out in 1993.  This is a very good DVD for Candy fans or those who appreciate funky sax-oriented jazz (who will likely enjoy the bonus performance better) although, as with most ""Jazz Fest"" events, the artists don't get to spend very much time on-stage.Sorry to say, I wasn't so impressed with the 2002 portion of this DVD, mainly because Candy's music leaned toward vocal-oriented tunes as opposed to instrumentals which highlight her sax as the voice.  As for the vocalizing, Candy was pretty good, and Monique Baker added a complementary soulful edge.  Another nice dimension was the excellent vocal dexterity of keyboardist Roger Happel (sort of a less-boyish version of Justin Timberlake), but his singing was a rare respite from the rest of the ""oh-oh-oh-yeah"" or ""gimme-the-funk"" repetition (mildly annoying).  Candy's band, the seven-member Funky Stuff, is pretty tight throughout, although the sound mixing is off at times, rendering Peter Lieberom's sax and Ulco Bed's guitar a little thin.  My favorite numbers were ""Longin' For the Funk"" and ""Sax-A-Go-Go,"" and the encore number rocked.  [The eight tracks have a running time of 54 minutes]The 1998 performance:  BETTER IN EVERY WAY (both music and production value) and I'm guessing that this wasn't the feature because it was a bit shorter and took place four years before the other one.  Five of the Funky Stuff members were the same, with the different musicians appearing in the rhythm section and as the third keyboardist (in place of the extra vocalist).  Candy's sax was front and center virtually all the way, and ALL the songs jammed.  The awesome cover of Bonnie Raitt's ""I Can't Make You Love Me,"" which gave many of the band members time in the spotlight, was a great departure from the up-tempo repertoire.  Whenever I watch this, I go straight to ""Bonus"" every time.

931368,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,B000AQKZ6I,J. SHARP,"[5, 5]","I have been a fan of Dutch saxophonist and bandleader Candy Dulfer since the early 90s but I've never seen her live. This purchase was an attempt to at least get a taste of what I've missed all these years. While it's good and I'm certainly happy I bought it, there are a few frustrations.The marquee set is marred by some instruments being virtually impossible to hear and editing that would make a mongoose exhausted. And on some tunes the vocalists (including Candy) are exhorting the crowd so incessantly  that you can hardly enjoy the songs. You'd think they were playing to a graveyard with all the effort they put into shouting ""C'mon, y'all!"", ""Put yo' hands together!"", and ""Give it up!"" every few seconds.As others have noted, the bonus set is actually the superior of the two. The mix levels are much more balanced, the video editing is less frenetic, and (for the most part) they just PLAY. And, man, are they good. Candy's jazz/funk fusion is just flat out fun and this set contains not a single weak number. The addition of an extended guitar solo and the restoration of the vocal to her cover of Bonnie Raitt's ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" seemed risky at first but ended up being absolutely fantastic. And Candy's blazing duel with the drummer on ""Pick Up the Pieces"" brought the house down.Full disclosure: I'm a guy. That means there's another bonus feature to seeing a Candy DVD. SEEING Candy! That's exquisite in both performances. I'll leave it at that.",4,Candy is great but mixed bag on mixing,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,1472,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Dutch', 'saxophonist', 'bandleader', 'Candy', 'Dulfer', 'early', '90s', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'live', 'purchase', 'was', 'attempt', 'least', 'get', 'taste', 'what', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'years', 'good', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'happy', 'bought', 'are', 'few', 'frustrations.The', 'marquee', 'set', 'marred', 'instruments', 'being', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'hear', 'editing', 'would', 'make', 'mongoose', 'exhausted', 'tunes', 'vocalists', 'including', 'Candy', 'are', 'exhorting', 'crowd', 'so', 'incessantly', 'can', 'hardly', 'enjoy', 'songs', ""'d"", 'think', 'were', 'playing', 'graveyard', 'effort', 'put', 'shouting', ""C'mon"", ""y'all"", 'Put', 'yo', 'hands', 'together', 'Give', 'up', 'few', 'seconds.As', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'bonus', 'set', 'actually', 'superior', 'two', 'mix', 'levels', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'balanced', 'video', 'editing', 'less', 'frenetic', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'PLAY', 'man', 'are', 'good', 'Candy', 'jazz/funk', 'fusion', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'fun', 'set', 'not', 'single', 'weak', 'number', 'addition', 'extended', 'guitar', 'solo', 'restoration', 'vocal', 'cover', 'Bonnie', 'Raitt', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Make', 'Love', 'Me', 'seemed', 'risky', 'first', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'Candy', 'blazing', 'duel', 'drummer', 'Pick', 'Up', 'Pieces', 'brought', 'house', 'down.Full', 'disclosure', ""'m"", 'guy', 'bonus', 'feature', 'seeing', 'Candy', 'DVD', 'SEEING', 'Candy', 'exquisite', 'performances', ""'ll"", 'leave']",N/A

This is supposed to be a jazz/funk concert, as opposed to a punk/rock concert...so why allow this kind of crazy, hurried/harriedcutting back and forth from camera to camera to camera???Makes no sense.In the future, can you PLEASE leave the camera on a performer for longer than THREE SECONDS? Is that too much to ask?Sound not right/clear between numbers. Can't figure out/understand what Candy is saying at all.Look, I love Candy Dulfer; she is clearly a talented sax player (could have done with her singing less, by the way), but her band is so damn loud that you can hardly make-out her own playing. Can't this sound ""problem"" be solved? Yes, her band is quite good, but I mainly bought this to be able to hear (AND SEE) HER PLAY.As someone else stated, the bonus tracks are better than the main concert.Finally, do I regret buying this DVD?
