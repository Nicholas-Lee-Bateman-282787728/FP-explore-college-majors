1634836,A336ELI13OGMHJ,B00BI6SUIE,"Bill Lee, Author","[2, 3]","This film is a realistic dramatization of at-risks and troubled youths facing incredible odds to stay safe and out of prison. As someone who grew up in violent street gangs and have worked with incarcerated teens, I applaud the writer and director for illustrating how children are often exploited by their own parents. The scenes are powerful and the acting (all around) is superb. Some of the reviewers have commented about the film's ending, but to me, it's perfect, from the standpoint of getting the message across regarding the life and death proposition that many youths face. The support system and structure that organizations like In the Hive provide is inspiring and they do work, when resources are adequate and caring, competent staff are in place.Chinese Playground : A Memoir",5,As Real As It Gets,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,790,"['film', 'realistic', 'dramatization', 'at-risks', 'troubled', 'youths', 'facing', 'incredible', 'odds', 'stay', 'safe', 'prison', 'someone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'violent', 'street', 'gangs', 'have', 'worked', 'incarcerated', 'teens', 'applaud', 'writer', 'director', 'illustrating', 'how', 'children', 'are', 'often', 'exploited', 'own', 'parents', 'scenes', 'are', 'powerful', 'acting', 'around', 'superb', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'film', 'ending', 'perfect', 'standpoint', 'getting', 'message', 'regarding', 'life', 'death', 'proposition', 'many', 'youths', 'face', 'support', 'system', 'structure', 'organizations', 'Hive', 'provide', 'inspiring', 'do', 'work', 'when', 'resources', 'are', 'adequate', 'caring', 'competent', 'staff', 'are', 'place.Chinese', 'Playground', 'Memoir']",In the Hive

It is a really great film, to be honest this is the first movie in along while that I have enjoyed from Robert Townsend, this is some of his finest work from this decade.This movie will have you dying to see the end, and what happens with the main characters, because you will get the sense that these young men are real, that they do exsist and in some ways they do, there are young men for various reasons who join gangs, or take the low road in life. And this movie potrays it perfectly, its not at all cheesy or preachy.I must warn that the ending is a cliff hanger, so you will feel a little disappointed at the end. I think this would have made a great show, and its one of the last works by Michael Clark Duncan (RIP)The Hive is an alternative school for young men, who have troubled there way out of the public school system, you will follow the life of one young man, with a history of gang life running deep in his family.

Then I watched it again and so glad I did, as I watched it another 2 times the same day. I love & miss the late Michael Clark Duncan, (Bear in Armaggedon) who was so great in that role. First I am not racist! I am white and retired, but grew up in the Midwest. My neighbors, best friends and dance partners were black, as well as our Prom Queen. My first taste of rasism was on vacation to FL in 1969. Where I got in trouble because I served the maid lunch! One of the nicest people I ever met. I went there for 10 days and left less than two days later, because of what I saw and was told I cannot do! This movie has every race and you will fall in love with most all of them, as you follow their lives.I can take a few curse words, save for one, GD, but it actually fit this movie. These young men get a second chance at the Hive or jail time. The teachers were mixed, most new and scared to death. You actually see them grow as well as these troubled young men and they way they live, gangs, home life or lack there of.Loretta, (I love) and always great, (up for a NCAAP award she better win) as she was over the top in this movie! Nobody could have done it better. Casting couldn't have been better. Vivica Fox was almost unrecognizable, but great too. Jonathan McDaniel, (I believe was his debue film) is destined to be seen a lot more. You are in for a real experience, emotional, furious and deeply inspiring trip, that's very thought provoking. In the end you will be standing and cheering for this movie. We should certainly be demanding more places like the Hive and want every young person out there to have such a second chance! Not to mention the staff of people that work there.Buy or rent this movie and I assure you, it can be life changing. Did you guess?
