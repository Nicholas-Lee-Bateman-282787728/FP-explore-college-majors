It could have been at any resort, from about 1880-1920, and nobody would ever have known the difference.  Such cannot be said about the Civil War.

The letter was written by a woman who had lived over 100 years before.  She is being pressured by her father to marry.  After all, she's 29 years old - shudder.  It could have been sappy.

191871,A17D77DFID0GZG,157492639X,"dsrussell ""greyhater""","[126, 130]","This wonderful Hallmark Hall of Fame television film was adapted from a short story from the master of time travel novels, Jack Finney (&quot;Time and Again&quot;, &quot;Time After Time&quot;, &quot;About Time&quot;, &quot;From Time to Time&quot;, just to name a few).  This story by Finney delves once again with time, in that a modern-day young man named Scott (played by Campbell Scott) discovers a letter hidden in a secret compartment of an antique desk that he had just purchased.  The letter (as well as the antique desk) belonged to a woman named Elizabeth (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) who (at the time of her writings) is living during the civil war.Scott becomes so enchanted by the letter that he ends writing to her, and after some obsession, and on a lark, actually decides to mail his response at a post office with historical significance using an authentic-period one-cent stamp.  Shortly thereafter, and to his utter astonishment, he discovers a second letter in the hidden compartment.  This letter turns out to be her reply to his letter...and thus begins a fascinating relationship of two people falling in love, but separated not by distance, but by 130 some odd years of time.Although this may seem to be a &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; with a time twist, it is really more similar to &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;.  Believe me, if you liked either one of those films, you'll love &quot;The Love Letter&quot;.  This fantasy/drama pulls you in and keeps you pleasantly entranced all the way to the end.  While this film does suffer a bit from situations handled too simplistically, I'm such a sucker for this type of film that I quickly forgave these missteps.Both Campbell Scott and Jennifer Jason Leigh were pretty good in this film, but the standout performance (and the one most believable) was Daphne Ashbrook who played Scott's fianc&eacute;e.While this small film may pale in comparison to the typical big budget Hollywood films, it is, nonetheless, a film I think you will be delighted to have in your collection.

While Lizzie's father could care less about Lizzie feeling any love for Mr. Reagle, Scotty completely understands her situation and advises her to follow her heart.  At the same time, Lizzie presents some trying questions to Scotty, making him question his own relationship with Debra.  Continuing on, Lizzie and Scotty both run into obstacles that bring them closer together, even though they are so far apart.Watch this one with the box of kleenex nearby, and here's a hint... listen carefully to Lizzie's last letter to Scotty.

191884,AX2KTTU418MII,157492639X,Jon Corelis,"[0, 0]","SF writer Jack Finney has been largely, and unjustly, forgotten by the general reading public.  His name is well known to film trivia buffs as the author of the novel on which the 1956 Don Siegal cult film Invasion of the Body Snatchers (and several remakes) was based, and fans of Science Fiction/Fantasy will know that he also was one of the few authors in the genre who achieved commercial success publishing in mainstream magazines like The Saturday Evening Post.  His classic time travel novel Time and Again, and its sequel, From Time to Time, are still well worth reading.Finney's work is basically fantasy with science overtones, often as a framework for conventional but well done boy-meets-girl romance stories; they are sometimes sentimental, but the sentiment is so innocently conveyed that it is charming rather than cloying.  This description also applies to The Love Letter, a TV-film version of one of Finney's classic short stories.  The premise is simple:  a young man in late 20th century Boston buys an antique desk originally owned by a young woman in a nearby town in the mid-19th century, and finds a letter she has written to an imaginary lover in a secret compartment.  He finds a way to answer the letter, and in the ensuing correspondence, the two fall in love.  Despite the obviously impossibility of such a relationship, the film manages to achieve a sort of happy ending.Though this film is technically science fantasy, the time travel aspect is achieved almost totally through the juxtaposition of realistic scenes from the two eras, with virtually no special effects. Though a made-for-TV movie, production values are very high, and the acting generally excellent, especially by Jennifer Jason Leigh as the Civil War era belle.  As basically a romance film, it may qualify as what is sometimes disparagingly called a ""chick flick,""  but the film's excellence and charm will appeal, I think, even to people who ordinarily don't like that genre.No advisories, except for some brief graphically grim scenes of wounded soldiers after Gettysburg.

'The Love Letter' is not time travel per se - no one actually travels through time...or do they? The dream sequences seem to tell another story, as does the very end when the dog walker enters the picture.But, passing letters through time is a unique way of presenting a time travel story. I just wonder why modern day Scott couldn't send his mail in the same way 1860's Elizabeth does - through the secret compartment in the desk.Accuracy must have been a priority for the director and producer in portraying the scenes from the past, as the language, the clothing, and the sets are among the best I have seen and heard and would put them against most period flicks. Even the short Battle of Gettysburg sequence was done very well.Warning: Spoilers coming up:There are a number of twists and turns throughout this movie to warrant repeated viewings - I'm on my third and I seem to catch something new each time. I think my very favorite 'twist' is near the end of the film, during the 'trunk' scene. The look on the caretaker's face upon looking inside is priceless.The other part that particularly strikes me is when Scott (in the modern day) has a publisher friend read an 1860's poetry verse that Elizabeth wrote, and the friend laughingly knocks it as being archaic, which angers Scott. Although not presented as such, to me that's part of the problem with today's society: it's that to be successful in today's jaded times one must be sexually explicit and/or violent. True passionate expression is a lost art.I do not care for the fact that Scott actually leaves his fiance for the 1860's 'ghost.' There is no reason for him to leave her; she is a very likable person.

It is truly a family movie and you don't have to worry that it will be offensive to anyone. Although the story line is a bit far out, with a supernatural quality, it is presented so naturally that you actually find yourself believing that it really happened. Some may be uncomfortable with the fact that the story is similar to re-incarnation, but personally I tried not to take that part of it too seriously. This movie is an improvement from the movie ""Somewhere in Time"" in which the character goes into the past in his mind through hypnosis. There is a ""realness"" about the way this movie is presented, and I also like that the characters ultimately get together. A great bit of acting on the part of Campbell Scott and Jennifer Jason Leigh to pull this one off!

This is one of the few romance movies I have ever seen thatdoes just that.Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays Elizabeth Whitcomb is stunning and makes the movie the work of art that it is.It starts out with Scotty (Campbell Scot) purchasing an antique desk at a local shop.He goes into the antique shop so his fiancee can look at a wedding dress that catches her eye, for their upcoming wedding.He gets the desk home and finds a secret compartment with a letter that she has written to an unknown love. He also finds ink and additional envelopes along with some stationary that is enscribed with her name. As a joke he writes a letter and  sends a reply to the woman.  Much to his surprise he finds a reply from her the following day. Before long he is writing Elizabeth, despite the diffence in time. The letter that she sent  in fact is meant for him, as he learns later. They have no chance of ever meeting. As they are writing, she is sending  her poetry as well. As he reads the letters and poetry he finds himself (although engaged) falling in love with Elizabeth. As he tries to shake the correspondance off, he finds his love for her is genuine.If you have ever seen ""Somewhere in Time"" this movie will haunt you in a similar way.As in ""Somewhere in Time if you can get past the flaws in the time links or time travel, you will find a movie that will grab you. Once this movie grabs you it wont let you go.This is about love from two people but the love defies time.This is not strictly a ""chick flick"". Men who enjoy romance movies will enjoy this also. Jennfer Jason Leigh plays her part to perfection in a time when life was more simple and values were different than today. The desk in many ways symbolizes a time that is now past.The ending is very good and will probably make you cry.My advice to you is watch this with your spouse or that special friend. This is the kind of romance that you rarely see and would love to see more often. This movie is wholesome and has no nudity or profanity.

Scott Corrigan is a Civil War buff who designs Civil War simulation games (check out the 1998 computer graphics!). One day as he and his fiancee Debra are shopping for a vintage wedding gown, he discovers an antique desk and it's love at first sight, even though he can't really afford it. Scott's also a restorer in his spare time, so when he tries to polish the desk, he discovers the (common Civil War) feature of a hidden compartment that contains a small bottle of ink, a fountain pen, and some blank stationary addressed ""Elizabeth Whitcomb."" He also finds a sensual, romantic letter to the imaginary man of Elizabeth's dreams, and Scott actually drafts a response using Elizabeth's pen and stationary. Scott's free spirit mother Beatrice is excited about the prospect, and finds vintage 1-cent stamps. Feeling crazy, Scott mails the letter from an Antebellum post office.And here's where the story takes a magical turn: hoping against hope, Scott opens the secret compartment to find a response, and he and Lizzie begin a romantic correspondence across time. The film does a beautiful job with the Civil War-era furnishings and costuming, and Jennifer Jason Leigh is positively radiant as Lizzie, although she is clearly older than Lizzie, whose age is given as 29. Campbell Scott is riveting as a man coming to grips with the fact that he's essentially in love with a ghost; just as in his later performance inFollow The Stars Home, he's a master at using glances and body language to convey emotion without overacting.Fans of Somewhere in Time will likely be drawn to Love Letter, but both stories are unique. I would have to say that Love Letter is much more bittersweet, but no less enjoyable.

He buys the desk, restores it, makes a neat discovery. There is actually a letter written by the woman, Elizabeth Witcomb, who once owned the drawer, hidden in a secret compartment. He send a response, via an old post office.To his shock, another letter pops up in the desk the next day, and they start a wierd pen pal relationship, and before long, both are in love, despite the time distance.If you are looking for a movie that centers around the Civil War, you'll be disappointed. It's obviously part of the plot, but the story centers around a impossible love. If you're one of those people who picks everything apart, save yourself the trouble, because this movie won't be for you.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. However, I couldn't give this a total of five stars, for one simple reason. I'm not entirely convinced of the love between Elizabeth and Scotty. It was made clear in the movie that Elizabeth longs for love. It seemed to me she was more in love with love than with Scotty himself, and her enjoyment in his letters seemed little more than desperation on her part for some romance. As for him, he's engaged to get hitched to a woman named Debra, but seems to be getting cold feet. He seems obsessed with Elizabeth, but keeps stringing Debra along. That's not fair to her, and makes me wonder if Scotty, like Elizabeth, is more in love with the idea of loving her than with her as a person.Still, the script was well written, the sets were great, (for a low budget film anyway) and everyone did a great job acting wise. If the courtship via letter hadn't been so rushed I might have been completely convinced that the leads were in love.

I watched it alone, so nobody saw the tears in my eyes at the  end. I was mostly impressed by the end of the movie - when the poems  actually went to print!  I am a poetess and I was immensely inspired by  the movie - I wrote the best poem of my whole life after watching it. Being  also a script-writer I appreciated every single detail of the movie.

Scotty, a civil war buff, who is engaged to be married to someone else, buys a very old desk, that belonged to a civil war general!Scotty is cleaning, and restoring the desk and finds a secret compartment with a love letter in it, from Lizzie who is living in the year 1863! Scott writes Lizzie , and then she writes him back, and they correspond to each other through time, with these love letters, and they fall in love, and realize that you cannot always change a life that has already been lived!If you are a hopeless romantic like me, this movie is for you! This movie reminded me for some reason ,of a real life, true story civil war, love letter that this man named Sullivan Ballou, wrote to his wife Sarah, before the battle of Bull Run! I learned about it from Ken Burns Civil War documentry, from the History Channel!
