This they did while out numbered, out fought by better troops, with very little in equipment and fighting in some of the worst terrain in the world. In fighting they managed to hold the Japanese long enough for the Japanese supply line to collapse so the Japanese had to retreat so saving New Guinea from Japanese control.

Middleton,"[11, 12]","Having an interest in Australian history, as well as teaching the subject to middle school students, the battle(s) on the Kokoda trail in Papua New Guinea between Australian forces and the invading Japanese, is a WW2 event that causes a sparkle to shine forth from the eyes of the students.Out numbered and out gunned, these Australian soldiers fought bravely under the worst of tropical conditions: rain, mud, jungle, malaria, and extreme heat. What makes this event memorable was the courage of a few men fighting against impossible odds and holding their position against a fierce adversary.Although slowing the Japanese invasion, in the end it was the harsh environmental conditions and a lack of supplies that prevented the invasions success. The 6000 Japanese soldiers, for the most part, died of starvation and disease. War is never a handsome affair, and the Australian film Kokoda depicts the conditions and extreme hardships with poignant reality...other than that, however, the film was a big disappointment.The impression is the director focused on portraying, as realistically as possible, the dire conditions of war. He accomplished this aim without question. However, Kokoda has no `plot' per say, there is no actual story in this film other than focusing on a small contingent of soldiers in retreat, their deaths and suffering, and the courage these men had in order to carry on despite the apparent uselessness of it all.As many people have commented after seeing this film, it begins compellingly, but we continue to watch expecting `something' to happen, a flashback of home from one of the soldiers, a character development or relationship explored to ensure we feel the pathos when one dies in battle; at least a `story' amongst the harsh conditions of war because there is only so much shooting and killing and audience can take.Kokoda is like an expensive documentary with great actors, well made, with no story other than the brief contextual explanation from a voice over at the beginning and a paragraph of information at the end. In fact, the film did not teach the audience anything about this important historical event in Australian history; guessing that the director expected `us' to know enough to feel the harshness of war and how close the invading force came to success.To be fair, this film is a good visual of history to convey what these courageous boy's experienced defending the country. My impression is that the director had tunnel vision, making the film to a small ""Australian informed audience"", because any audience overseas would wonder what the film was all about.In the end, my students gained a better visceral understanding of a part of history they should be proud of, that war is a reality and nothing to be glorified because war is pure hell. And their grandfathers and great grandfathers' fought bravely to defend our country against a ferocious enemy.A 2.5 rating at best.",2,A Realistic Film with No Plot...,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,2930,"['Having', 'interest', 'Australian', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'teaching', 'subject', 'middle', 'school', 'students', 'battle', 'Kokoda', 'trail', 'Papua', 'New', 'Guinea', 'Australian', 'forces', 'invading', 'Japanese', 'WW2', 'event', 'sparkle', 'shine', 'forth', 'eyes', 'students.Out', 'numbered', 'gunned', 'Australian', 'soldiers', 'fought', 'bravely', 'worst', 'tropical', 'conditions', 'rain', 'mud', 'jungle', 'malaria', 'extreme', 'heat', 'What', 'event', 'memorable', 'was', 'courage', 'few', 'men', 'fighting', 'impossible', 'odds', 'holding', 'position', 'fierce', 'slowing', 'Japanese', 'invasion', 'end', 'was', 'harsh', 'environmental', 'conditions', 'lack', 'supplies', 'prevented', 'invasions', 'success', '6000', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'most', 'part', 'died', 'starvation', 'disease', 'War', 'never', 'handsome', 'affair', 'Australian', 'film', 'Kokoda', 'conditions', 'extreme', 'hardships', 'poignant', 'reality', 'other', 'however', 'film', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment.The', 'impression', 'director', 'focused', 'portraying', 'as', 'realistically', 'possible', 'dire', 'conditions', 'war', 'accomplished', 'aim', 'question', 'However', 'Kokoda', 'plot', 'say', 'actual', 'story', 'film', 'other', 'focusing', 'small', 'contingent', 'soldiers', 'retreat', 'deaths', 'suffering', 'courage', 'men', 'had', 'order', 'carry', 'apparent', 'uselessness', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'commented', 'seeing', 'film', 'compellingly', 'continue', 'watch', 'expecting', 'something', 'happen', 'flashback', 'home', 'one', 'soldiers', 'character', 'development', 'relationship', 'explored', 'ensure', 'feel', 'pathos', 'when', 'one', 'battle', 'least', 'story', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'war', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'shooting', 'killing', 'audience', 'can', 'take.Kokoda', 'expensive', 'documentary', 'great', 'actors', 'well', 'made', 'story', 'other', 'brief', 'contextual', 'explanation', 'voice', 'beginning', 'paragraph', 'information', 'end', 'fact', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'teach', 'audience', 'anything', 'important', 'historical', 'event', 'Australian', 'history', 'guessing', 'director', 'expected', 'know', 'enough', 'feel', 'harshness', 'war', 'how', 'close', 'invading', 'force', 'came', 'success.To', 'be', 'fair', 'film', 'good', 'visual', 'history', 'convey', 'what', 'courageous', 'boy', 'experienced', 'defending', 'country', 'impression', 'director', 'had', 'tunnel', 'vision', 'making', 'film', 'small', 'Australian', 'informed', 'audience', 'audience', 'overseas', 'would', 'wonder', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'end', 'students', 'gained', 'better', 'visceral', 'understanding', 'part', 'history', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'war', 'reality', 'nothing', 'be', 'glorified', 'war', 'pure', 'hell', 'grandfathers', 'great', 'grandfathers', 'fought', 'bravely', 'defend', 'country', 'ferocious', 'enemy.A', '2.5', 'rating', 'best']",Kokoda
1032716,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B000K7VL06,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This is a good, solid war movie, which sticks I believe quite succesfully to the reality of jungle war as Australians waged it in 1942 in New Guinea. Below, you will some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.The Kokoda trail is a 60 miles long foot path which crosses the Owen Stanley Range on New Guinea island. In 1942 it was the only track which connected Port Moresby on the southern side of the island with the Oro province, on the northern side, beyond the mountains. After failing in their direct attack against Port Moresby the Japanese high command decided to seize this strategically crucial port by an infantry attack coming from Buna on the northern coast of the island through the Kokoda trail. Obviously, Australian high command decided to contest this attack with all the (very limited) forces it was possible to muster.This film tells the story of a small Australian infantry platoon forced to make a fighting retreat from approximately the middle of Kokoda trail to the village of Isurava, which is near the southern end of the track. It is inspired by real events, both on the strategical and tactical levels - Isurava village really existed and at one moment it became indeed a rallying point to all scattered Australian troops retreating from the north through Kokoda trail.This is a very brutal and tough film, in which the real fighting plays a rather secondary role - it is the jungle with all its attractions (heat, humidity, mud, insects and other vermin) which is for most of the time the real oponent of Australian soldiers. The war is nevertheless very present and even the smallest wound received in the most insignificant skirmish can become deadly, as the jungle jumps on every weakness and tries to choke out the life of any wounded, sick or exhausted man...The scenario is quite solid, actors (all completely unknown to me) did very well and this film can be considered as rather succesful. I must say that I missed a little bit some action scenes - there is very little fighting in this film indeed - but on another hand it makes this movie quite realistic. War is after all made mostly of a lot of walking, resupplying, digging and waiting, all interrupted on rare occasions by short but intense episodes of extreme violence...Weapons, uniforms and equipments are also quite realistically shown - as is the unbelievable brutality of Japanese soldiers.I was quite impressed by one of the final scenes, which includes a lot of wounded Australian soldiers (no more details will be provided) and shows a REAL episode - it is a surprisingly low key scene, but once I actually understood fully what was happening, well, I had tears in my eyes... The quite, stoic beauty of this heroic final act is definitely one of the best war scenes I ever saw in a movie...Bottom line, I liked this film and I will keep the DVD for a future reviewing. Not a great masterpiece, but a very honest, solid, well thought and well done thing. I can not really say that I enjoyed it (it is pretty nightmarish), but I am glad that I saw it.",4,"A road movie as much as a war film - except that here the road is a muddy path in the middle of green, steamy, rotting hell...",1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,3062,"['good', 'solid', 'war', 'movie', 'believe', 'quite', 'succesfully', 'reality', 'jungle', 'war', 'Australians', 'waged', '1942', 'New', 'Guinea', 'Below', 'will', 'more', 'impressions', 'limited', 'SPOILERS.The', 'Kokoda', 'trail', '60', 'miles', 'long', 'foot', 'path', 'Owen', 'Stanley', 'Range', 'New', 'Guinea', 'island', '1942', 'was', 'only', 'track', 'connected', 'Port', 'Moresby', 'southern', 'side', 'island', 'Oro', 'province', 'northern', 'side', 'mountains', 'failing', 'direct', 'attack', 'Port', 'Moresby', 'Japanese', 'high', 'command', 'decided', 'seize', 'strategically', 'crucial', 'port', 'infantry', 'attack', 'coming', 'Buna', 'northern', 'coast', 'island', 'Kokoda', 'trail', 'Obviously', 'Australian', 'high', 'command', 'decided', 'contest', 'attack', 'very', 'limited', 'forces', 'was', 'possible', 'muster.This', 'film', 'story', 'small', 'Australian', 'infantry', 'platoon', 'forced', 'make', 'fighting', 'retreat', 'approximately', 'middle', 'Kokoda', 'trail', 'village', 'Isurava', 'southern', 'end', 'track', 'inspired', 'real', 'events', 'strategical', 'tactical', 'levels', 'Isurava', 'village', 'really', 'existed', 'one', 'moment', 'became', 'indeed', 'rallying', 'point', 'scattered', 'Australian', 'troops', 'retreating', 'north', 'Kokoda', 'trail.This', 'very', 'brutal', 'tough', 'film', 'real', 'fighting', 'rather', 'secondary', 'role', 'jungle', 'attractions', 'heat', 'humidity', 'mud', 'insects', 'other', 'vermin', 'most', 'time', 'real', 'oponent', 'Australian', 'soldiers', 'war', 'nevertheless', 'very', 'present', 'even', 'smallest', 'wound', 'received', 'most', 'insignificant', 'skirmish', 'can', 'become', 'deadly', 'jungle', 'jumps', 'weakness', 'tries', 'choke', 'out', 'life', 'wounded', 'sick', 'exhausted', 'man', 'scenario', 'quite', 'solid', 'actors', 'completely', 'unknown', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'rather', 'succesful', 'must', 'say', 'missed', 'little', 'bit', 'action', 'scenes', 'very', 'little', 'fighting', 'film', 'indeed', 'hand', 'movie', 'quite', 'realistic', 'War', 'made', 'mostly', 'lot', 'walking', 'resupplying', 'digging', 'waiting', 'interrupted', 'rare', 'occasions', 'short', 'intense', 'episodes', 'extreme', 'violence', 'Weapons', 'uniforms', 'equipments', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'realistically', 'shown', 'unbelievable', 'brutality', 'Japanese', 'soldiers.I', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'one', 'final', 'scenes', 'lot', 'wounded', 'Australian', 'soldiers', 'more', 'details', 'will', 'be', 'provided', 'REAL', 'episode', 'surprisingly', 'low', 'key', 'scene', 'once', 'actually', 'understood', 'fully', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'well', 'had', 'tears', 'eyes', 'quite', 'stoic', 'beauty', 'heroic', 'final', 'act', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'war', 'scenes', 'ever', 'saw', 'movie', 'Bottom', 'line', 'liked', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'DVD', 'future', 'reviewing', 'Not', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'very', 'honest', 'solid', 'well', 'thought', 'well', 'done', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'pretty', 'nightmarish', 'am', 'glad', 'saw']",Kokoda

1032718,A2FIMQIKNOHFPK,B000K7VL06,S. White,"[6, 7]","I have avoided this review for some time but couldn't hold back any longer. I saw this film not long after it came out on DVD. It pains me to have to call this film out for what it is, largely flawed and missing the mark; particularly in a tradition of Australian cinema that has so often delivered incredibly powerful and poignant war epics which tell the history of our diggers ... Breaker Morant and Gallipoli but two among them.I found myself cringing as the film dragged on, it had a great deal of potential but became a complete cop out focusing only on a group of fear gripped Militia. I think that the entire trajectory of the film is a slap in the face to those that served during that time. If you read your history and do any research on these men you know they were made of stiffer stuff than is portrayed in this film. My reading of Kokoda and this film are at opposite ends of the spectrum for realism! The point is that they were called Chocko soldiers but showed themselves to be anything but!Another major disappointment was the weak battle scenes - when a final charge by the Japanese comes late in the film during a night time engagement we see possibly only about 13 Japanese come out of the scrub to make an attack and then the camera only shows about 4.5 secs of the battle instead focusing on an Aussie soldiers face as he deals with an off screen enemy we are supposed to now imagine! Waste of yet another cinematic opportunity.I am proud of Australian Military history and felt this movie did nothing to serve it in any way shape or form. An opportunity was missed, when you consider how rare it is that we see films made about the Aussie WW2 period and this is what we get to stand in celluloid as representation one of the greatest and most sacred of Australian wartime engagements?Fair suck of the sav!",2,A complete disservice!,1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,1830,"['have', 'avoided', 'review', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'longer', 'saw', 'film', 'not', 'long', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'have', 'call', 'film', 'out', 'what', 'largely', 'flawed', 'missing', 'mark', 'particularly', 'tradition', 'Australian', 'cinema', 'so', 'often', 'delivered', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'poignant', 'war', 'epics', 'tell', 'history', 'diggers', 'Breaker', 'Morant', 'Gallipoli', 'two', 'them.I', 'found', 'myself', 'cringing', 'film', 'dragged', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'potential', 'became', 'complete', 'cop', 'focusing', 'only', 'group', 'fear', 'gripped', 'Militia', 'think', 'entire', 'trajectory', 'film', 'slap', 'face', 'served', 'time', 'read', 'history', 'do', 'research', 'men', 'know', 'were', 'made', 'stiffer', 'stuff', 'portrayed', 'film', 'reading', 'Kokoda', 'film', 'are', 'opposite', 'ends', 'spectrum', 'realism', 'point', 'were', 'called', 'Chocko', 'soldiers', 'showed', 'be', 'anything', 'major', 'disappointment', 'was', 'weak', 'battle', 'scenes', 'when', 'final', 'charge', 'Japanese', 'late', 'film', 'night', 'time', 'engagement', 'see', 'possibly', 'only', '13', 'Japanese', 'come', 'scrub', 'make', 'attack', 'then', 'camera', 'only', '4.5', 'secs', 'battle', 'instead', 'focusing', 'Aussie', 'soldiers', 'face', 'off', 'screen', 'enemy', 'are', 'supposed', 'now', 'imagine', 'Waste', 'yet', 'cinematic', 'opportunity.I', 'am', 'proud', 'Australian', 'Military', 'history', 'felt', 'movie', 'did', 'nothing', 'serve', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'opportunity', 'was', 'missed', 'when', 'consider', 'how', 'rare', 'see', 'films', 'made', 'Aussie', 'WW2', 'period', 'what', 'get', 'stand', 'celluloid', 'representation', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'sacred', 'Australian', 'wartime', 'engagements', 'Fair', 'suck', 'sav']",Kokoda
1032719,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,B000K7VL06,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[5, 6]","The battle of the Kokoda trail was one of the more imporant battles in the countries history. Australian troops fougth against an invading Japanese Army in New Guinea and eventually defeated it as as an all Australian military operation. It was the second defeant of Japanese forces after another Australian operation at Milne Bay.The battle took place over some months and for most of the time Australian troops were heavily outnumbered fighting against a well trained and fanatical enemy.The action of this film seems to take place after the battle of Mission Ridge when the defending Australian Marouba force was overrun and forced to retreat through the jungle.The problem with the film is that it is basically gloomy and shows a rather defeated Australian patrol retreating in dreadful conditions. The cast keeps on talking about only being "" choclat soldiers "" ( derogatory term for militia ) and waiting for the AIF to turn up.The reality is that whilst the conditions these battles were fought in were dreadful the Australian troops performed well. At the initial battles of Kokoda 1 and 2 400 Australian troops were by their aggressive counter attacks were able to delay an invading force of 2,500 Japanese. The Japanese commander in fact thought that Australia had some 6,000 troops in the field they were so effective.In the defensive battles around Isurava around 1,000 troops kept 5,000 Japanese troops at Bay. The effect of the various defensive battles was that the Japanese ran out of supplies and eventually by the time they reached the end of the trail most of their army was starving and wracked with Typhoid. This prevented further offensive operations and the Japanese were forced into a catostrophic retreat.The reality is that the Australian troops were skilled and self confident not like the scared winners portrayed in this film.

1032720,A1SFFZEZJVZ23K,B000K7VL06,Topaz Pig,"[0, 1]","I was bitterly disappointed in this film. Most of the one and two star reviews have said the most important things.As an Australian, I thought the whole theme deserved much better treatment. The Kokoda Track has become a symbol and an icon in Australian mythology; it symbolises courage and determination against the most overshelming odds.But two major things were missing. The first was the sense that they were part of a much larger force. A consequence of this omission was another glaring fault: the lack of any real sense of mateship, togetherness and good humour. There were bits of it, but the overwhelming impression was that of a disjointed rabble fighting for no more than their survival.What the movie did do was portray some of the real horrors of war. But it missed out totally on the redeeming aspects (in the sense of making the best out of a horrible situation) such as humour, mateship and cameraderie.This movie is yet another example of how Australian movie makers think they can simply tap into Australian symbols  (eg the landscape, Ned Kelly, Phar Lap, etc) and make a winner, simply by the conjuring up of that name or symbol.After such disjointedness, horror and negativity, William McInnes' speech about the soldiers' heroism seemed absurdly out of place.In an episode of Faulty Towers, the American tourist (Mr Anderson) said to Faulty ""...you are the British Tourist Board's answer to Donald Duck!""In like manner, I would suggest that this movie is the Australian Movie Industry's answer to Jane Campion.",1,Soylent Dick Says: Awful - the Australian Movie Industry's answer to Jane Campion,1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,1532,"['was', 'bitterly', 'disappointed', 'film', 'Most', 'one', 'two', 'star', 'reviews', 'have', 'said', 'most', 'important', 'things.As', 'Australian', 'thought', 'whole', 'theme', 'deserved', 'much', 'better', 'treatment', 'Kokoda', 'Track', 'become', 'symbol', 'icon', 'Australian', 'mythology', 'courage', 'determination', 'most', 'overshelming', 'odds.But', 'two', 'major', 'things', 'were', 'missing', 'first', 'was', 'sense', 'were', 'part', 'much', 'larger', 'force', 'consequence', 'omission', 'was', 'glaring', 'fault', 'lack', 'real', 'sense', 'mateship', 'togetherness', 'good', 'humour', 'were', 'bits', 'overwhelming', 'impression', 'was', 'disjointed', 'rabble', 'fighting', 'more', 'survival.What', 'movie', 'did', 'do', 'was', 'portray', 'real', 'horrors', 'war', 'missed', 'out', 'totally', 'redeeming', 'aspects', 'sense', 'making', 'best', 'horrible', 'situation', 'such', 'humour', 'mateship', 'cameraderie.This', 'movie', 'yet', 'example', 'how', 'Australian', 'movie', 'makers', 'think', 'can', 'simply', 'tap', 'Australian', 'symbols', 'eg', 'landscape', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'etc', 'make', 'winner', 'simply', 'conjuring', 'up', 'name', 'symbol.After', 'such', 'disjointedness', 'horror', 'negativity', 'William', 'McInnes', 'speech', 'soldiers', 'heroism', 'seemed', 'absurdly', 'place.In', 'episode', 'Faulty', 'Towers', 'American', 'tourist', 'Mr', 'Anderson', 'said', 'Faulty', 'are', 'British', 'Tourist', 'Board', 'answer', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'like', 'manner', 'would', 'suggest', 'movie', 'Australian', 'Movie', 'Industry', 'answer', 'Jane', 'Campion']",Kokoda
