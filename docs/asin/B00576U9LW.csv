It had some good story lines too, it wasn't a one off, each story built onto others, and some had threads that carried through to other seasons. Fun to watch.",5,Wow,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,268,"['first', 'saw', 'series', 'Showtime', 'got', 'big', 'kick', 'CG', 'mecha', 'ships', 'robots', 'anime', 'hijinks', 'had', 'good', 'story', 'lines', 'too', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'off', 'story', 'built', 'others', 'had', 'threads', 'carried', 'other', 'seasons', 'Fun', 'watch']",N/A
1444536,A1RO76WBFX9XRJ,B00576U9LW,NC,"[5, 5]","Vandread is just one of those shows. If you read the manga, it is at times a bit sloppy and it doesn't really fill in much more than the show. The characters cut from that for the show are not missed and the execution is much better in the anime. The show itself fixes a lot of problems from the manga and generally makes you want to watch it again from time to time.This series gets classified as a harem comedy at times but after watching it, I wouldn't quite classify it as that. There is a harem concept but it is not exploited in Vandread to the fullest. Very much unlike shows like Love Hina where it is clear there is a mass of women all fawning after 1 guy. That said, the characters and setting are quite enjoyable in a Disneyized version of two same sex societies. If you are expecting a fanservice feast, you won't be totally thrilled with Vandread. There is fanservice for sure but it is rather mild compared to other shows.If a 4.5 star rating could be given, I would. Because it is not perfect. The aspects not quite perfect are simple. It gets a little heavy on psychology aspects later in the show. ""Proving one's existence"" and such. Thankfully it won't leave a horrible sour taste in your mouth but at times you will wish it would just move the story along. Then the second aspect one would complain about kinda ties in with the aforementioned. That is the main protagonist. Hibiki is quite a weak character throughout much of the story. He has his moments but, there just isn't a whole lot to like about him. He is an echo of the Tarak male society but also one which opposes it. These two factors constantly clash, sometimes for the better but often as a jerk. This does affect the harem concept because he is just not a character all women would be drawn to.In the end, despite it's issues, Vandread is a show you can watch more than once and enjoy. There is some decent CG work done and you can really see a far deeper storyline set in the Vandread universe. The potential is there and it is a shame the storyline was not continued further. When the story ends, it provides very good closure but also shows this potential. Always a good sign. Whether the show gets revisited again or not, who knows. For now, enjoy it for what it is. A fun romp through space with great characters and super Vandread Pyoro!",5,"One of those, better than the manga, shows",1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,2328,"['Vandread', 'just', 'one', 'shows', 'read', 'manga', 'times', 'bit', 'sloppy', ""n't"", 'really', 'fill', 'much', 'more', 'show', 'characters', 'cut', 'show', 'are', 'not', 'missed', 'execution', 'much', 'better', 'anime', 'show', 'fixes', 'lot', 'problems', 'manga', 'generally', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'time', 'time.This', 'series', 'classified', 'harem', 'comedy', 'times', 'watching', 'would', ""n't"", 'quite', 'classify', 'harem', 'concept', 'not', 'exploited', 'Vandread', 'fullest', 'Very', 'much', 'shows', 'Love', 'Hina', 'where', 'clear', 'mass', 'women', 'fawning', '1', 'guy', 'said', 'characters', 'setting', 'are', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Disneyized', 'version', 'two', 'same', 'sex', 'societies', 'are', 'expecting', 'fanservice', 'feast', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'totally', 'thrilled', 'Vandread', 'fanservice', 'sure', 'rather', 'mild', 'compared', 'other', 'shows.If', '4.5', 'star', 'rating', 'could', 'be', 'given', 'would', 'not', 'perfect', 'aspects', 'not', 'quite', 'perfect', 'are', 'simple', 'little', 'heavy', 'psychology', 'aspects', 'later', 'show', 'Proving', 'one', 'existence', 'such', 'Thankfully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'horrible', 'sour', 'taste', 'mouth', 'times', 'will', 'wish', 'would', 'just', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'Then', 'second', 'aspect', 'one', 'would', 'complain', 'kinda', 'ties', 'aforementioned', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Hibiki', 'quite', 'weak', 'character', 'much', 'story', 'moments', 'just', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'like', 'echo', 'Tarak', 'male', 'society', 'also', 'one', 'two', 'factors', 'constantly', 'clash', 'sometimes', 'better', 'often', 'jerk', 'affect', 'harem', 'concept', 'just', 'not', 'character', 'women', 'would', 'be', 'drawn', 'end', 'issues', 'Vandread', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'enjoy', 'decent', 'CG', 'work', 'done', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'far', 'deeper', 'storyline', 'set', 'Vandread', 'universe', 'potential', 'there', 'shame', 'storyline', 'was', 'not', 'continued', 'further', 'When', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'closure', 'also', 'potential', 'good', 'sign', 'show', 'revisited', 'again', 'not', 'who', 'now', 'enjoy', 'what', 'fun', 'romp', 'space', 'great', 'characters', 'super', 'Vandread', 'Pyoro']",N/A
