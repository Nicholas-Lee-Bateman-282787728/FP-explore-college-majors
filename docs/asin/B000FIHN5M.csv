990628,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FIHN5M,A Customer,"[9, 12]","Ask The Dust is a film of great beauty, but it's also a film of great disappointment. The art direction, the gorgeous creation of Downtown Los Angeles circa 1933 is unsurpassed and is one of the most spectacular set pieces you will ever see. Unfortunately though, the movie is long and sort of outstays it's welcome and it commits the inexplicable sin of being rather boring, particularly about two thirds of the way through when it really loses steam.Colin Farrell - a bit miscast here - stars as Arturo Bandini an Italian writer who has arrived in Los Angeles where he hopes to make it big as a writer - he's already had one story published, in a fictionalized version of Mencken's American Mercury magazine. Ensconcing himself in a shabby hotel near Bunker Hill, downtown Los Angeles, Bandini begins to write what will hopefully be his masterpiece.Ablaze with ambition and sexual frustration, Bandini is down to his last dime when he buys a cup of coffee at a downtown cafe and meets Camilla (Salma Hayek), a fiery Mexican waitress who can't read English, has a real attitude towards upstart young writers and has aspirations to become as Anglicized as she possibly can. Each in their own way, hopes to escape the horrors of racism, but they find themselves enigmatically drawn to each other and eventually fall in love.Their relationship, however, is faced with many tests full of love and hate as they struggle to overcome their own fears and biases to form a meaningful bond. And much of the action comes out of the maddening way that two compatible people will unaccountably behave when thrust into each other's presence.There are lots of heavy-handed narrative developments - Hayek and Farrell cavort together in the Pacific Ocean, there's an earthquake, an out-of-left-field fatal illness - that dominate the film's second half and the efforts at showing societal racism particularly towards Camilla are often not as developed as they should be.While the script is often clunky and wooden and it's two stars don't really have the sort of fiery sexual passion that they should have in a movie such as this, Ask The Dust is saved by its beautiful images and sumptuousness. Visually, the film is filled with evocative details of an innocent L.A. before the oil companies stripped away the wonderful Red Trams and all the cars and the freeways turned it into the dirty, filthy city that it is now.Ask The Dust offers a stunning depiction of 1930s Los Angeles, and the director Robert Towne has really managed to capture the essential ingredients of Robert Towne John Fante's source material. Farrell and Hayek are also charismatic performers, but the movie as a whole is rather wet and innocuous - it isn't nearly as involving as it should be.

990633,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000FIHN5M,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[34, 37]","`Ask the Dust' is not a bad movie, not by any means, but I will say that even with it's under two-hour running time it seems a bit long.  The fact that this is a slow moving drama of course doesn't help the matter, but what does help is the dedication both Colin and Salma give to their characters.  This film is adapted from the critically acclaimed novel by John Fante about an Italian writer Aturo Bandini (Farrell) as he moves to LA in 1932 in pursuit of inspiration for his next short story.  As he struggles to find that inspiration he meets a sassy young barmaid Camilla (Hayek) who both tests his patience and his heart strings, for she is everything he wishes he had and yet is trying to escape.They begin their love affair fighting and they continue fighting throughout most of the film.  It's a wonder they stay together, but it's apparent that they see in each other something that makes them happy.  Both of them share the similar wanting of acceptance, and neither of them are comfortable with their place in society.  Camilla in particular is ashamed of her name, and Bandini even makes mention to a day when he won't be ashamed of the name he was given.There are two scenes in this film that brought me to tears, the first being Aturo's encounter with the lovely stranger Vera (Idina Menzel).  It was the first scene in the film where I was brought to the realization that this movie had a meaning, and from that heart wrenching scene on I was absorbed in this picture.  Her story is beautiful and touching, and the look on Aturo's face perfectly captures the essence of what we should be feeling at that very moment.  The second scene is the love scene between Aturo and Camilla, which takes place towards the end of the film.  It was so tastefully done, so beautiful and serene that it took all the tension between them out of the picture and delivered a touching and beautiful encounter that said more than words could ever do.  Truly the most touching scene in the film and one of the most beautiful scene's I've seen in recent cinema (and that comment has nothing to do with the fact that both are eye-candy, it's all in the emotion, and believe me, the emotion was there).So, my final analysis, after much thought and deliberation, is that `Ask the Dust' is a good movie made better by the chemistry of the two leads.  It could have been much better had it paced itself a little better, but it's forgiven for once you understand the underlying message of this film you can appreciate it much better for what it is.  I would have changed a few things but bottom line is it's still a wonderful film and it delivers what it intended to.  Brilliant job on the actors involved, Colin who at first I felt was miscast blew me away with a few important scenes, and Hayek I feel is at her finest.",4,The more I think about it the more I'm smitten...,1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,2809,"['Ask', 'Dust', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'means', 'will', 'say', 'even', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'bit', 'long', 'fact', 'slow', 'moving', 'drama', 'course', ""n't"", 'help', 'matter', 'what', 'help', 'dedication', 'Colin', 'Salma', 'give', 'characters', 'film', 'adapted', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'novel', 'John', 'Fante', 'Italian', 'writer', 'Aturo', 'Bandini', 'Farrell', 'LA', '1932', 'pursuit', 'inspiration', 'next', 'short', 'story', 'find', 'inspiration', 'sassy', 'young', 'barmaid', 'Camilla', 'Hayek', 'who', 'patience', 'heart', 'strings', 'everything', 'had', 'yet', 'trying', 'escape.They', 'begin', 'love', 'affair', 'fighting', 'continue', 'fighting', 'most', 'film', 'wonder', 'stay', 'together', 'apparent', 'see', 'other', 'something', 'happy', 'share', 'similar', 'wanting', 'acceptance', 'are', 'comfortable', 'place', 'society', 'Camilla', 'particular', 'ashamed', 'name', 'Bandini', 'even', 'mention', 'day', 'when', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'ashamed', 'name', 'was', 'given.There', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'film', 'brought', 'tears', 'first', 'being', 'Aturo', 'encounter', 'lovely', 'stranger', 'Vera', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'was', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'was', 'brought', 'realization', 'movie', 'had', 'meaning', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'scene', 'was', 'absorbed', 'picture', 'story', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'look', 'Aturo', 'face', 'perfectly', 'essence', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'feeling', 'very', 'moment', 'second', 'scene', 'love', 'scene', 'Aturo', 'Camilla', 'place', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'tastefully', 'done', 'so', 'beautiful', 'serene', 'took', 'tension', 'picture', 'delivered', 'touching', 'beautiful', 'encounter', 'said', 'more', 'words', 'could', 'ever', 'do', 'Truly', 'most', 'touching', 'scene', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'cinema', 'comment', 'nothing', 'do', 'fact', 'are', 'eye-candy', 'emotion', 'believe', 'emotion', 'was', 'there', '.So', 'final', 'analysis', 'much', 'thought', 'deliberation', 'Ask', 'Dust', 'good', 'movie', 'made', 'better', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'paced', 'little', 'better', 'forgiven', 'once', 'understand', 'underlying', 'message', 'film', 'can', 'appreciate', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'few', 'things', 'bottom', 'line', 'still', 'wonderful', 'film', 'what', 'intended', 'Brilliant', 'job', 'actors', 'involved', 'Colin', 'who', 'first', 'felt', 'was', 'miscast', 'away', 'few', 'important', 'scenes', 'Hayek', 'feel', 'finest']",N/A

990637,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000FIHN5M,Grady Harp,"[4, 6]","Robert Towne's obvious love affair with John Fante's Depression Era novel, ASK THE DUST, is evident throughout this somewhat over-long film.  While the story is a bit clumsy and self-indulgent with so many sidebars that the momentum of the movie gets bogged down in the telling, there are enough fine attributes to make it a recommended evening of reminiscence about Los Angeles, the City of the Angels in the 1930s.Arturo Bandini (Colin Farrell) narrates the tale of a lad from Colorado with one published story in a magazine edited by H.L. Mencken  who moves to Los Angeles' Bunker Hill apartments to write his big novel.  The city of LA has never seemed so strange as it seems with Caleb Deschanel's magnificent photography outlining a city filled with dust blown miscreants - people with dreams at varying stages of dissolution.  Arturo quickly becomes penniless, is pestered for rent by landlady Mrs. Hargraves (Dame Eileen Atkins) and for handouts by drunkard Hellfrick (Donald Sutherland), and still a virgin he plies his vision as a writer in a local cafe where he encounters the beautiful Camilla (way too much of a play on the character of Dumas' 'Camille'...).  The two play a battle of wits and insults to cover their apparent infatuation with each other: Mexican Camilla is looking for a wealthy 'white man' to raise her out of her illiterate station and Arturo is looking for a sexual encounter to spur his writing.During their extended 'courting' Arturo is vamped by Vera Rivkin (Idina Menzel), a Jewish housekeeper with grossly deformed legs who dreams of a man who will call her beautiful, and in a touching encounter Arturo displays the kind  vulnerability lying under his rather callous and naive exterior.Arturo and Camilla at last connect, and in a Laguna beach house they fall under the spell of love, a state that ends tragically, like the dust from the desert winds burying all hopes of the people of Southern California.The story is a bit clunky and the dialogue feels forced at times but it is always a pleasure to see the work of Farrell, Hayek, Atkins, and Sutherland. The true beauty of this truly beautiful film is in the atmosphere and the mood captured by Towne and Deschanel.  Their work offers a mood piece that forgives some of the awkwardness of the threadbare story and shows off the actors well.  The film may move a bit too slowly for some, but for others, this is a moment of history well captured.

Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[3, 4]","Set during the depression, Ask the Dust examines what happens when two immigrants expectations of what they want to get out of life changes drastically when they meet each other.Arutro Bandito (Colin Ferrell) is an Italian American, first generation who moves to LA to write a great novel, a love story.  But his experience in life is limited and he finds himself stumped on what he should write about.  Flat broke and desperate, he spends his last nickel on a cup of coffee at a diner.  There he meets Camilla (Selma Hayek), a beautiful and feisty Mexican woman who is trying to get her citizenship.  The two of them spark immediately.  They have chemistry, but not always in a good way.  Arturo is infatuated with her but wants to meet a blue eyed California girl that are so abundant in LA.  Camilla is enamored as well but she is looking for a rich man to marry and bring her up to high society.As Arturo starts to have success in his writing, Camilla warms up to him and the possibility of loving him.  Arturo finds, with the help of a woman who is physically disfigured, that his anger toward Camilla is based on the fact that he has great passion for her but can't imagine diverting from his dream.The movie is unsympathetic in it's display of racism and character differences.  Things are rough, and the life of these two young people is not envied on many levels.  Farrell and Hayek give spectacular performances for what they have.  Hayek is especially striking and powerful, embracing the role with no fear, especially with the nude scenes.  If the movie were better I would say she should get an Oscar.But alas, the movie is not great.  It is good.  It's character study is original and the love story is not like anything we have seen on screen before.  The ending is not neat and tidy.  Director Robert Towne seemed to want it that way.  He didn't want a polished version of the novel this movie is based on, he wanted something that spoke in the same manner, which is not always welcomed with wide audiences.

""A New Yorker""","[10, 11]","Ever since Frida, I have been waiting for Salma to come back and do a similar impressing movie and of course Salma pull this one off very well same goes for Collin Farrell. I don't think a lot of people really understand what they're seeing here. Never mind the source material; this is a glossy Hollywood melodrama in the vein of 'Some Come Running,' which is a good comparison, for that movie also dealt with the Artist Coming Into His Own and evolving into a more empathetic human being through a disastrous love story. I personally enjoyed it throughout. For me, the characters seemed real - people who were trying to be someone they were not, which fits with their environment.Arturo and Camilla seemed to ""fight"" their love for each other, moment to moment alternately revealing or suppressing their prejudices. Take out the racial element and it reminded me a bit of Deanie and Bud in 'Splendor in the Grass', you almost expect them to burst into flames as they battle the demons that conspire to keep them apart. Just when they finally seem to find some peace with each other it all falls apart during the simple gesture of going on their ""first"" date. The passion between Atruro and Camillia is great and the love scenes are fantastic especially a flashback scene that takes place in the ocean. I was touched by Arturo's attempts to teach Camilla to read from one particular book (title of my review) and attain citizenship.I was also impressed with the performances of Idina Menzel (especially the scene's with Atrturo mention by reviewer Damian) and Donald Sutherland (the latter a bit reminiscent of Sutherland's Homer Simpson in (""The Day of the Locust""). I was so glad to see Robert Towne's name in the credits again, I based my decision to see the film on my high regard for his work and that of Salma's as well. I find it ironic that Robert Towne, a product of the last golden age of cinema, would re-appear just as we seem to be having a 70's-like renaissance in independent film, just like the 70's/Vietnam era?

990643,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000FIHN5M,Lee Armstrong,"[6, 8]","The 70s were big for Robert Towne.  He won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for ""Chinatown"" in 1974 and was nominated for his screenplays for ""The Last Detail"" in 1973 & ""Shampoo"" in 1975.  He directed ""Tequila Sunrise"" in 1988 & wrote the screenplays for both ""Mission Impossible I & II.""  While I've never read John Fante's book, I can tell that Towne has lovingly brought this to the screen.  Colin Farrell is a bona fide star now after ""Miami Vice,"" ""Minority Report,"" ""Phone Booth,"" & other films.  As Arturo Bandini, he does a good job as the uncertain writer who longs for experience.  However, it's kind of hard to believe that a guy with Colin Farrell's looks is romantically inexperienced.  The final scene at the unmarked grave shows great emotion as he quotes from his book the passage that Camilla thought should be included.  Both Farrell and Selma Hayek look good cavorting naked in the moonlight bouncing on ocean waves.  As Camilla Lopez, Selma Hayek does a good as the high maintenance waitress.  Hayek's lone Oscar nomination was for Best Actress as ""Frida"" in 2002 and also did excellent work in ""The Maldonado Miracle.""  In this Tom Cruise-produced film she winds up with venom and then unwinds with kindness.  Although it was a good by-the-numbers romance by Selma & Colin, I didn't get the intensity or chemistry that Towne wanted to show for Arturo & Camilla.  Donald Sutherland cameos as Hellbrick, a wasted geezer who lives in Farrell's building.  As a flaw in the screenplay, nothing Sutherland does is indispensable to the story; so his role has a superfluous feel.  Idina Menzel who was in the musical version of ""Rent"" and ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" in 2001 plays Vera Rifkin.  Vera's self image has been shattered by some type of wound, possibly a burn, and she comes on strong to Arturo, impressed by his literary talk.  As the Camilla romance reaches a low, Arturo visits Vera, and with lovemaking motivated by pity gains experience just before an earthquake crushes Vera's skull.  Menzel does a nice job as the needy housekeeper.  Justin Kirk who was in ""Angels in America"" & on the ""Weeds"" TV series cameos as the bartender Sammy who befriends Camilla and gives Arturo romantic tips on how Camilla needs a rough touch.  Eileen Atkins whose career has spanned films like ""Equus"" in 1977 to ""The Avengers"" to ""Gosford Park"" does a good job as the bigoted landlady who doesn't allow Mexicans or Jews.  Towne's screenplay highlights racial tolerance through the vehicle of the Bandini-Lopez romance.  A lesser theme is Camilla's marijuana use, which Bandini strongly opposes.  While it seemed a bit long and the DVD doesn't add a lot for extras, ""Ask the Dust"" is a good evening's entertainment worth seeing.

Whether this hurts or helps is beside the point, since Fante's work is not readily available, and few today can claim to have read the source novel. Such as things are, we are presented with a story of Arturo Bandini (Colin Farrell), an Italian-American who travels from the Colorado boondocks to the big city to write his book while being self-consciously aware that a lot of people don't view him as quite American as they are. While in LA he meets a Mexican barhop named Camilla Lopez (Salma Hayek) whose goal in life, apparently, is to become a white man's strumpet to achieve artificial social status, selling the only thing she has to offer (which she displays to Bandini during a late-night rendezvous at the beach).  Bandini himself is not confident enough of his own status in the Anglo world to give-in easily to Lopez charms, which explains his own lack of charm as he provides some less-than-romantic views on her position in the human ladder.(At this point it should be noted the movie strays from the book in another significant way. As Fante himself said, the plot of Dust resembled that of Of Human Bondage; the Lopez character was desperately in love with an Anglo who despised her, while she despised Bandini and rejected his overtures. Eventually he found his place in the world while she became a dope addict and went insane.)Bandini does come around eventually, since as Lopez points out his name is no great improvement over her own (although he gets in a back-at-you, joking that she wants to be ""Mrs. White"").  Never-the-less, the ethnic and racial divide between them won't go away, and after an ugly scene at a movie theater (not in the book) we realize that Bandini may still be holding out for that blondie. The film ends with Bandini the successful author confessing that the reason he treated Lopez so badly could be traced to his own pain, when as a youth in Colorado he was called various uncomplimentary names based on his Italian heritage by the Aryan youth there, and how he knew he wasn't one of them and could never be. And now, of course, he was ashamed of the way he had behaved (this polemic occurred early in the book, so we didn't have to guess what his problem was).It is interesting to note that Fante--an Italian-American who was raised in Colorada--apparently had a similar relationship in real-life, and he was able to confront the failings of society and his own faults so honestly. Compare this with another Italian-American from Colorado--congressman Tom Tancredo, who currently is on an anti-Hispanic hate crusade (masquerading as an undocumented-worker campaign) and who clearly has issues that for him can only be dealt with by out-bigoting the bigots.",3,"A little off message from the novel, but still worth a look.",1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,2876,"['Dust', 'film', 'few', 'liberties', 'John', 'Fante', 'novel', 'particularly', 'insofar', 'greater', 'prominence', 'racial', 'ethnic', 'aspects', 'book', 'point', 'Fante', 'work', 'not', 'readily', 'available', 'few', 'today', 'can', 'claim', 'have', 'read', 'source', 'novel', 'Such', 'things', 'are', 'are', 'presented', 'story', 'Arturo', 'Bandini', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Italian-American', 'who', 'Colorado', 'boondocks', 'big', 'city', 'write', 'book', 'being', 'self-consciously', 'aware', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'view', 'quite', 'American', 'are', 'LA', 'Mexican', 'barhop', 'named', 'Camilla', 'Lopez', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'goal', 'life', 'apparently', 'become', 'white', 'man', 'strumpet', 'achieve', 'artificial', 'social', 'status', 'selling', 'only', 'thing', 'offer', 'Bandini', 'late-night', 'rendezvous', 'beach', 'Bandini', 'not', 'confident', 'enough', 'own', 'status', 'Anglo', 'world', 'give-in', 'easily', 'Lopez', 'charms', 'own', 'lack', 'charm', 'less-than-romantic', 'views', 'position', 'human', 'ladder', 'point', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'movie', 'book', 'significant', 'way', 'Fante', 'said', 'plot', 'Dust', 'resembled', 'Human', 'Bondage', 'Lopez', 'character', 'was', 'desperately', 'love', 'Anglo', 'who', 'despised', 'despised', 'Bandini', 'rejected', 'overtures', 'Eventually', 'found', 'place', 'world', 'became', 'dope', 'addict', 'went', 'insane', 'Bandini', 'come', 'eventually', 'Lopez', 'out', 'name', 'great', 'improvement', 'own', 'back-at-you', 'joking', 'be', 'Mrs.', 'White', 'Never-the-less', 'ethnic', 'racial', 'divide', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'ugly', 'scene', 'movie', 'theater', 'not', 'book', 'realize', 'Bandini', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'holding', 'out', 'blondie', 'film', 'Bandini', 'successful', 'author', 'confessing', 'reason', 'treated', 'Lopez', 'so', 'badly', 'could', 'be', 'traced', 'own', 'pain', 'when', 'youth', 'Colorado', 'was', 'called', 'various', 'uncomplimentary', 'names', 'based', 'Italian', 'heritage', 'Aryan', 'youth', 'there', 'how', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'now', 'course', 'was', 'ashamed', 'way', 'had', 'behaved', 'polemic', 'occurred', 'early', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'guess', 'what', 'problem', 'was', '.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'Fante', 'Italian-American', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'Colorada', 'apparently', 'had', 'similar', 'relationship', 'real-life', 'was', 'able', 'confront', 'failings', 'society', 'own', 'faults', 'so', 'honestly', 'Compare', 'Italian-American', 'Colorado', 'congressman', 'Tom', 'Tancredo', 'who', 'currently', 'anti-Hispanic', 'hate', 'crusade', 'masquerading', 'undocumented-worker', 'campaign', 'who', 'clearly', 'issues', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'dealt', 'out-bigoting', 'bigots']",N/A

But the film as a whole just does not jell together.Though the source material by John Fante is adapted by Towne himself ( he also wrote and directed the classic ""Chinatown"") many scenes are arch and downright silly: Colin Farrell as Arturo Bandini and Salma Hayek as Camilla Perez...two actors who have shown real warmth and genuine emotion heretofore are mostly lost here with only a handful of scenes that actually work. That being said their sex scene, with very few words spoken is truly sensual and beautifully shot...a particularly tough thing to film successfully.Bandini (really Fante) comes to Los Angeles to escape the prejudice of his native Colorado but mostly to write, having already had a short story published in H.L.

990647,A2QVGELFE9LL41,B000FIHN5M,"Michael A. Scheurich ""The Professor""","[3, 6]",I was expecting another Mexican movie bashing white culture. But the fact it was in English rather than Spanish I thought it may have been a offshoot of the dust theory being pushed by some religions. Whatever my mistakes were I watched it through because it continued to baffle me like a mystery story and I couldn't figure out what was going to happen next. So much for my stupid reasons for watching it.The movie was brilliantly done. It was about a shy handsome Mexican writer posing as an Italian writer whose quest to get live off a blonde hair blue eyed American woman in order to finance his writing career was thwarted when he met a Mexican prostitute who was in the United States illegally and serving drinks in a bar. A fiery relationship resulted when she is attracted to him due to his Mexican features. He is attracted to her for the same reason and eventually gets over his shyness for women and falls in love with her and vows to make her into a legitimate American citizen and marry her. The movie portrayed the landscape beautifully and had many historical elements. I had no idea for instance that Florida had an earthquake or that the dust problem we have in Los Angeles today was also considered a problem is 1933. As today the industrial age's pollution on palm trees was also an aspect of the movie. This was a gutsy movie showing the biases of many American cities against Mexicans and Jews. I value this movie as another voice in the ethnic battles which have taken over the politics in the United States today. This movie attempts to address many issues at once. Birth deformities is another issue aired in this movie. Whether you fully understood the movie or not the attempt to recreate the 1933's was masterfully accomplished and the historical value well worth it.,5,View of 1933 America,1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,1794,"['was', 'expecting', 'Mexican', 'movie', 'bashing', 'white', 'culture', 'fact', 'was', 'English', 'rather', 'Spanish', 'thought', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'offshoot', 'dust', 'theory', 'being', 'pushed', 'religions', 'mistakes', 'were', 'watched', 'continued', 'baffle', 'mystery', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'So', 'much', 'stupid', 'reasons', 'watching', 'it.The', 'movie', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'was', 'shy', 'handsome', 'Mexican', 'writer', 'posing', 'Italian', 'writer', 'quest', 'get', 'live', 'off', 'blonde', 'hair', 'blue', 'eyed', 'American', 'woman', 'order', 'finance', 'writing', 'career', 'was', 'thwarted', 'when', 'met', 'Mexican', 'prostitute', 'who', 'was', 'United', 'States', 'illegally', 'serving', 'drinks', 'bar', 'fiery', 'relationship', 'resulted', 'when', 'attracted', 'due', 'Mexican', 'features', 'attracted', 'same', 'reason', 'eventually', 'shyness', 'women', 'falls', 'love', 'make', 'legitimate', 'American', 'citizen', 'marry', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'landscape', 'beautifully', 'had', 'many', 'historical', 'elements', 'had', 'idea', 'instance', 'Florida', 'had', 'earthquake', 'dust', 'problem', 'have', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'today', 'was', 'also', 'considered', 'problem', '1933', 'today', 'industrial', 'age', 'pollution', 'palm', 'trees', 'was', 'also', 'aspect', 'movie', 'was', 'gutsy', 'movie', 'showing', 'biases', 'many', 'American', 'cities', 'Mexicans', 'Jews', 'value', 'movie', 'voice', 'ethnic', 'battles', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'politics', 'United', 'States', 'today', 'movie', 'address', 'many', 'issues', 'once', 'Birth', 'deformities', 'issue', 'aired', 'movie', 'fully', 'understood', 'movie', 'not', 'attempt', 'recreate', '1933', 'was', 'masterfully', 'accomplished', 'historical', 'value', 'well']",N/A

It has affecting performances from Colin Farrell as Arturo Bandini, an aspiring writer in Depression era Los Angeles and Salma Hayek, who burns up the screen as Camilla, a Mexican waitress intent on bettering her lot. Excellent period details with a strong, understated cameo from Donald Sutherland and a strange, rather wonderful turn from Idina Menzel as a lonely, hard drinking, disfigured, literary Jewish girl besotted with Bandini. Bandini, who is pretty lonely himself, is shown subsisting on oranges, cigarette butts, and the occasional check from H.L. Mencken. He's thin skinned, hugely ambitious, fearful of failure, and in a state of continuous, prickly anger at the world. Arturo and Camilla don't meet cute: they spend a good deal of time insulting each other, using ethnic slurs that don't generally figure in standard issue Hollywood romances.

990651,A1TVP6C06M6ZKX,B000FIHN5M,"Paul Papadopoulos ""Kinky Greek""","[1, 3]","I must admit that I have not read John Fante's novel on which this movie is based. The big question is, did I need to? Ask the Dust as a movie is a delightful little self-contained drama, almost a melodrama if it had not been changed for ever from being that by its ending.  It was a film never destined to be a blockbuster or win a Oscar (if that means much anyway). Nevertheless, it is a work of art and  while it may lag in places for those of short attention span, if you stay with it, the film is most entertaining. Colin Farrell is more impressive as Arturo Bandini the would-be  novelist than in his flat lead role in Alexander, and Salma  Hayek, as beautiful  as ever, playing the role of the earthy and highly sexual  Mexican waitress Camilla Lopez, whether  buck naked  in the moonlit ocean,  making soft porn love in a seaside cottage or fully clothed shod in native espadrilles serving coffee in a bar, is an excellent actress, something that was not revealed in thinner roles she  has played before such as with Antonio Banderas in  the mindless but  entertaining Desperado romp.  To her  credit it is hard to realise that Miss Hayek is ten years older than Farrell.One does not need to be a geographer to learn  that the film story based in Southern  California in the early 1930s was actually shot in South Africa near Cape Town. This fact is revealed in the ending credits if you care to read them. Maybe it was cheaper to shoot there but more likely it was easier to capture an image of what Los Angeles may have looked like back then than any attempt to produce the film in modern day California. The desert scenes are very convincing even though a pendant might say the vegetation is not quite right, where are the Joshua trees? But that is nit picking.There are several themes in the film which are not hard to discern. Indeed, this movie is empty of mysteries or surprises. There is much  awkwardness in the relationship between two young people who are inevitably attracted to each other and  deeply in love, although they don't realise this truth until near the end. They are always at each other's throats almost as if they are struggling to resist the deep feelings they have for one another. The meaning of the ""battle of the sexes"" becomes very clear. Their relationship is not only complicated by their almost virginal youth and inexperience (inevitably more in the young man than the woman) but by the fact that they both belong to ""coloured"" minorities; she a Mexican probably  with some Indian blood, he of  Southern Italian  parentage, both with black hair, dark eyes and swarthy complexions. she is a Lopez he a Bandini, therefore  both are liable to the open discrimination considered acceptable in the pre-holocaust era.The youth is an aspiring but not yet successful writer of short stories, with one published in a magazine,who has yet to produce a novel (he can only type 2000 words a day or that's his excuse). He meets the beautiful  Mexican girl serving at a slightly down at heel caf&eacute; bar near the gloomy entrance to a  highway tunnel in one of the less salubrious parts of Los Angeles. Their first encounter is not encouraging, which  leads the girl to say much later  in the movie ""Why do you have to be so mean when you first meet somebody?""The theme of race also interferes in their relationship where they sling insults at each other. Camilla, an immigrant, is hoping to become a US citizen, Arturo is  already one by birth. They both desperately want to  believe in the myth of  American equality and in the US constitution which he teaches her for her citizenship exam. She is illiterate, at least in English (hardly the ideal companion of a writer,)so he also helps her in reading English via a children's illustrated book about a dog.The young man had arrived in LA with several hundred dollars in his pocket, almost a small fortune in those days, but with virtually no income and rather wasteful habits at first so he is down to less than a single nickel (the price of a cup of coffee)when the story begins. He rents a  room in a cheap boarding house,whose grimy back abuts on a hillside. His view is of the scaly trunk of an uncared for scraggy date palm dying slowly from the already evident LA  pollution. However, the rear window of his room provides him with an escape route from the middle-aged landlady always at the front hall desk  who is after him for seriously  past due rent. When he arrives in LA- in a flashback-  and asks for a room  the landlady assumes by his colour that  he is Mexican and bluntly informs him that she doesn't  rent rooms to Jews or Mexicans but seem reassured when he tells her he is Italian (she probably doesn't know what an Italian is).The old fellow (played by Donald Sutherland) across the way is a down and out who like most of the neighbourhood  came to LA  seeking success and failed.  He owes Arturo some small change but arranges to seduce the milkman so the author can pinch a couple of bottles from the cart while the Milko is occupied. The implication, when  the dilapidated  alcoholic neighbour appears (though never spoken) is ""look at me and what I am now-thus you in time will also become"".  It is on the day when  the old neighbour pays back a nickel debt in coin that the story is launched as Arturo rushes off  to the nearby caf&eacute; bar for his long-awaited  luxury - a cup of coffee- where he is destined to meet Camilla.The girl is in a somewhat better position as she has a regular though obviously low-paid job. She runs a 1927 convertible and is apparently supported by the young blond barman Harold. It is unclear what Harold's sexual preferences are and they probably don't sleep together. He is a kind of protector. Camilla reveals to Arturo that Harold suffers from tuberculosis and won't live very long. Unfortunately  once this fortuitous  piece of information was given I guessed where the film was going and how it would end.There is one diversion which doesn't seem vitally necessary to the story line  when a good looking thirty-something  New York City exile  pursues the writer. She is a disfigured one-time wealthy  Jewess who has been evicted by her husband who could not bring himself  to accept her scarred body.  She is another LA misfit  whose passion serves the young man as a test for his real love for the Mexican girl.  The woman is conveniently  evicted again, this time  from the story itself by her sudden death in an Long Beach earthquake. The scenario of the film  is not very complex  beyond the battle of the sexes and the need for people- who did not quite fit the contemporary  image of the ideal Americana, as fair skinned, blue eyed and blond- to establish an identity as they had wrongly been induced to believe that they were somehow inferior.Unlike King of the Hill, (itself a movie  perhaps  too glossy to describe the reality of that era despite the ""Hoovervilles"" in it), Ask the Dirt is not a tale of the 1930s economic depression.  While late for the rent at the beginning  neither Arturo or Camilla are ranked with  the homeless who briefly appear in the movie. True  Arturo is often skint, but he is  saved from destitution  by an unexpected cheque from his  magazine  publisher.  At the very end of the film he is apparently wealthy and successful but that is an add-on which has  little or nothing to do with the story.The cinematography is superb and the low key jazzy guitar music on the background  soundtrack  is haunting and appropriate to the setting. If you don't believe me just Ask the Dust!

990652,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B000FIHN5M,Richard B. Schwartz,"[1, 1]","John Fante&#8217;s Ask the Dust is considered by some to be the great California novel.  It is a very fine novel, in the league with The Day of the Locust and Miss Lonelyhearts.  The film version is written and directed by the great Robert Towne, among whose scripts is, of course, Chinatown.  Polanski changed Towne&#8217;s ending in Chinatown; here Towne changes Fante&#8217;s ending (slightly, but plausibly).The production values are very high and Towne captures the feel of Depression-era Los Angeles amazingly well, considering the fact that he is not working with a prince&#8217;s ransom-level budget.  This is also impressive, considering that he is shooting in South Africa, but the wonderful film The Fall, set in 20&#8217;s L.A. was also shot in South Africa.Ask the Dust concerns a writer from Colorado who moves to L.A. to hit the big time.  Much of it is autobiographical, as Fante clawed his way from poverty to a ranch in Malibu.  His name is Arturo Bandini (there is a series of Bandini novels); he falls for a waitress at a local greasy spoon named Camilla Lopez (who wishes her name was Lombard).  Their relationship is rocky and ends sadly.  Each is loved, to some degree, by another person, Arturo by a reader/fan from Long Beach and Camilla by the bartender in her restaurant.These relationships feel very real and one has the feeling that Fante is writing autobiography rather than creating fictional individuals in order to achieve literary effects.  Bottom line: the plot arcs seem slightly &#8216;off&#8217;, the plot development resultingly slow and quirky.  Much is made, e.g., of Arturo&#8217;s alcoholic neighbor in his cheap hotel (played superbly by Donald Sutherland).  The neighbor owes Arturo 15 cents (a significant sum in those days) and wishes to help him in any way that he can.  He knows that the local milkman will stop in to share a drink with him at 4:00 a.m. and he tells Arturo that that would offer him the chance to sneak out and grab a couple bottles of milk.  After some soul-searching Arturo does it, but is then disgusted by the fact that he has stolen buttermilk, which he spits into his sink.  This is an important scene in the novel, but it is, as I said earlier, quirky in a film.  It feels real, however.The core problem with the film is that the novel&#8217;s power comes from Arturo/John&#8217;s emotional responses to experience.  The novel reads like an extended, powerful, lyrical, touching voiceover, but Towne cannot make a movie that is one long voiceover, and yet he wants to be as faithful as possible to the film.  And he does so for nearly two hours.  The performances are exceptional; the look and feel of Bunker Hill in the Depression is superb; the movie is touching, the script (line by line) excellent.  However, the film feels thirty minutes too long and the novel&#8217;s essential strengths are muted by the need to tell a more conventional story.I still recommend this often-overlooked film (its U.S. gross was less than a million dollars) and I also recommend the novel on which it is based.",4,An Interesting Adaptation of the Novel,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,3069,"['John', 'Fante', '8217', 'Ask', 'Dust', 'considered', 'be', 'great', 'California', 'novel', 'very', 'fine', 'novel', 'league', 'Day', 'Locust', 'Miss', 'Lonelyhearts', 'film', 'version', 'written', 'directed', 'great', 'Robert', 'Towne', 'scripts', 'course', 'Chinatown', 'Polanski', 'changed', 'Towne', '8217', 's', 'ending', 'Chinatown', 'here', 'Towne', 'changes', 'Fante', '8217', 'ending', 'slightly', 'plausibly', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'Towne', 'feel', 'Depression-era', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'amazingly', 'well', 'considering', 'fact', 'not', 'working', 'prince', '8217', 's', 'ransom-level', 'budget', 'also', 'impressive', 'considering', 'shooting', 'South', 'Africa', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Fall', 'set', '20', '8217', 'L.A.', 'was', 'also', 'shot', 'South', 'Africa.Ask', 'Dust', 'writer', 'Colorado', 'who', 'L.A.', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'Much', 'autobiographical', 'Fante', 'clawed', 'way', 'poverty', 'ranch', 'Malibu', 'name', 'Arturo', 'Bandini', 'series', 'Bandini', 'novels', 'waitress', 'local', 'greasy', 'spoon', 'named', 'Camilla', 'Lopez', 'who', 'name', 'was', 'Lombard', 'relationship', 'rocky', 'sadly', 'loved', 'degree', 'person', 'Arturo', 'reader/fan', 'Long', 'Beach', 'Camilla', 'bartender', 'restaurant.These', 'relationships', 'feel', 'very', 'real', 'one', 'feeling', 'Fante', 'writing', 'rather', 'creating', 'fictional', 'individuals', 'order', 'achieve', 'literary', 'effects', 'Bottom', 'line', 'plot', 'arcs', 'seem', 'slightly', '8216', '8217', 'plot', 'development', 'resultingly', 'slow', 'quirky', 'Much', 'made', 'e.g.', 'Arturo', '8217', 'alcoholic', 'neighbor', 'cheap', 'hotel', 'played', 'superbly', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'neighbor', 'Arturo', '15', 'cents', 'significant', 'sum', 'days', 'help', 'way', 'can', 'local', 'milkman', 'will', 'stop', 'share', 'drink', '4:00', 'a.m.', 'would', 'offer', 'chance', 'sneak', 'out', 'grab', 'couple', 'bottles', 'milk', 'soul-searching', 'Arturo', 'then', 'disgusted', 'fact', 'stolen', 'buttermilk', 'sink', 'important', 'scene', 'novel', 'said', 'earlier', 'quirky', 'film', 'feels', 'real', 'however.The', 'core', 'problem', 'film', 'novel', '8217', 's', 'power', 'Arturo/John', '8217', 'emotional', 'responses', 'experience', 'novel', 'reads', 'extended', 'powerful', 'lyrical', 'touching', 'voiceover', 'Towne', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'long', 'voiceover', 'yet', 'be', 'as', 'faithful', 'possible', 'film', 'so', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'performances', 'are', 'exceptional', 'look', 'feel', 'Bunker', 'Hill', 'Depression', 'superb', 'movie', 'touching', 'script', 'line', 'line', 'excellent', 'However', 'film', 'feels', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'novel', '8217', 'essential', 'strengths', 'are', 'muted', 'need', 'tell', 'more', 'conventional', 'story.I', 'still', 'recommend', 'often-overlooked', 'film', 'U.S.', 'gross', 'was', 'less', 'million', 'dollars', 'also', 'recommend', 'novel', 'based']",N/A

Donald Sutherland, on the other hand, is almost thoroughly wasted here; one wonders how many of his scenes ended up left on the cutting room floor, because I can't imagine an actor of his caliber taking a role so small and so incidental to the story. Other small oddities surface (why is it that the landlady, so dead set against Bandini having women in his room, never comes pounding on the door during his 4AM screaming fights with them?).

990659,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000FIHN5M,Timothy Kearney,"[37, 44]","I know, the critics didn't love ASK THE DUST. I think I know why. Any film that has a writer as a protagonist, who writes what sounds like amateur prose and falls in love with a woman who seems to have more than a few similarities, at least health wise to the heroines of CAMILLE/LA TRAVIATA isn't going to make too many critics cheer. They've seen it all before and believe it was done better in earlier versions. It's also a bit far fetched to believe that a mediocre at best writer would have a champion in a figure like H. L. Mencken, but it all happens in this film. There is also a character who doesn't add much to the film but is played by a revered veteran, in this case Donald Sutherland. Fail to use a great actor in a proper way and the critics will balk. Of course there are times when clich&eacute;s on the screen work well on the written page, and people I know who have read the 1939 classic on which the film is based say that the book does work well, but critics didn't seem to believe that it happened in this film.While the critics may have their points, I enjoyed this film. Colin Farrell plays Arturo Bandini, a son of Italian immigrants from Colorado who hopes to become a successful writer. His character remains consistent throughout the film and while we know we should be rooting for him, we're not sure if we like him. Salma Hayek is Camilla, the Mexican waitress who becomes the love interest of Bandini. The two clash and become lovers and clash again. It had a feel of the 1930's and I enjoyed that a Depression Era story took place in somewhere other than Chicago, New York, or Boston. While I didn't buy the main character's success and luck--I may have believed it if he had received at least one rejection instead of a check for a short story and another check as an advance for a novel--he did have some characteristics of an aspiring writer. The immigration and prejudice issues were accurate for the period and the love story believable.For me, this is a three and a half star film, but since I have to choose at either three or four, I'll choose four. The setting is incredible and while I wouldn't call this the best performance for either Hayek or Farrell, this is not meant to be a criticism. Farrell has demonstrated the ability to be at home in box office blockbusters and independent films, so we know he's versatile, and Salma Hayek's performance in FRIDA alone demonstrates her talent. The story does hold together and while far fetched at times is somewhat plausible. Overall, I believe the great talent both in front of and behind the camera (directed by Robert Towne of CHINATOWN fame) leads viewers to expect more, but what we have isn't bad and is enjoyable.",4,"Critics Didn't Love The Film, but Give It A Chance, You Might",1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,2710,"['know', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'ASK', 'THE', 'DUST', 'think', 'know', 'why', 'film', 'writer', 'protagonist', 'who', 'what', 'like', 'amateur', 'prose', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'more', 'few', 'similarities', 'least', 'health', 'wise', 'heroines', 'CAMILLE/LA', 'TRAVIATA', ""n't"", 'going', 'make', 'too', 'many', 'critics', 'cheer', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'believe', 'was', 'done', 'better', 'earlier', 'versions', 'also', 'bit', 'far', 'fetched', 'believe', 'mediocre', 'best', 'writer', 'would', 'have', 'champion', 'figure', 'H.', 'L.', 'Mencken', 'film', 'also', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'film', 'played', 'revered', 'veteran', 'case', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Fail', 'use', 'great', 'actor', 'proper', 'way', 'critics', 'will', 'balk', 'course', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'clich', 'eacute', 'screen', 'work', 'well', 'written', 'page', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'have', 'read', '1939', 'classic', 'film', 'based', 'say', 'book', 'work', 'well', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'believe', 'happened', 'film.While', 'critics', 'may', 'have', 'points', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Arturo', 'Bandini', 'son', 'Italian', 'immigrants', 'Colorado', 'who', 'become', 'successful', 'writer', 'character', 'consistent', 'film', 'know', 'should', 'be', 'rooting', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'like', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Camilla', 'Mexican', 'waitress', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'Bandini', 'two', 'clash', 'become', 'lovers', 'clash', 'again', 'had', 'feel', '1930', 'enjoyed', 'Depression', 'Era', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'somewhere', 'other', 'Chicago', 'New', 'York', 'Boston', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'main', 'character', 'success', 'luck', 'may', 'have', 'believed', 'had', 'received', 'least', 'one', 'rejection', 'instead', 'check', 'short', 'story', 'check', 'advance', 'novel', 'did', 'have', 'characteristics', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'immigration', 'prejudice', 'issues', 'were', 'accurate', 'period', 'love', 'story', 'three', 'half', 'star', 'film', 'have', 'choose', 'three', 'four', ""'ll"", 'choose', 'four', 'setting', 'incredible', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'best', 'performance', 'Hayek', 'Farrell', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'criticism', 'Farrell', 'demonstrated', 'ability', 'be', 'home', 'box', 'office', 'blockbusters', 'independent', 'films', 'know', 'versatile', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'performance', 'FRIDA', 'alone', 'talent', 'story', 'hold', 'together', 'far', 'fetched', 'times', 'somewhat', 'plausible', 'Overall', 'believe', 'great', 'talent', 'front', 'camera', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Towne', 'CHINATOWN', 'fame', 'viewers', 'expect', 'more', 'what', 'have', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enjoyable']",N/A
