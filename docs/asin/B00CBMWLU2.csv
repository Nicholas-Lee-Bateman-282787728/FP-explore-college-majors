I also like how the Character (Luther)helps others , he is loyal, he fights to keep some sense of balance of justice while trying to stick to the rules. He does all with great conflict since sometimes has to bend the rules in order to save someone's life. He values those victimized by others. He is tough, doesn't get intimidated and is extremely clever.One thing about the show is that I feel people in London should get ""peep holes"" really they just open there doors to anyone. I live in NY would never even answer the door unless your expected. Last season when the former abused hooker opens the door to the bad cop I cringed...come on could she not figure out that Luther would have his own key...really it drives me crazy when they just mindlessly open the door whenever someone knocks on it. They taught me that like when I was toddler in NY....look through peep hole if your expecting someone...if your not do not even answer the door.

The black policewoman who was after him last season ups the ante this season, trying to recruit his partner as an informer. meanwhile, Luther is busy solving the cases.  Indris Elba who plays Luther is a terrific actor and is now starring in movies as well.  Netflix streaming also carries this series. i love the music in the series too.the humdinger of a story in this series is a vigilante, tom marwood, who is trying to avenge his murdered wife by murdering criminals. although he is initially sympathetic, as tom gets more out of control, he becomes a menace to society in general and Luther in particular. in this episode we also see the return of red haired Alice, who looks out for Luther even though she is a criminal fugitive.  although Luther has a new girlfriend, mary, i frankly can see him with Alice better.there is only one aspect i didn't care for but i suspect it is personal to me and i have put it as a spoiler below.update with POSSIBLE SPOILERS:  one of my frequent readers took me to task about such a short review of Luther.  i commented back that something had bothered me about season three but i could not figure out what it was.  i have now figured it out and i am rather surprised at myself.  what bothers me about this series of Luther is that there is heavy involvement in the cases of two cops doing an internal affairs investigation of him and trying to get him dismissed.  i was a huge fan of Rebus by Ian Rankin.  But I could not stand his new series on an internal affairs cop and stopped reading it. i loved Denzel Washington in TRAINING DAY where he won an Oscar for playing a cop gone bad.  Other than that film, however, I really hate these tv shows about incompetent cops trying to remove someone who is getting the job done.  I absolutely HATED the black woman policeman and the Scot male policeman, who with coarse and heavy handed methods, investigate Luther. i think the moral for me is that i personally am done with internal affairs plotlines. if you are not, this is otherwise up to the excellent standards of the prior two seasons.  in all good conscience, i cannot mark something down because something is hitting my own personal buttons.",5,great but only four episodes,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,2478,"['star', 'career', 'taken', 'off', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'only', 'four', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'however', 'high', 'quality', 'episode', 'usual', 'not', 'only', 'figure', 'out', 'mystery', 'solve', 'also', 'survive', 'plots', 'department', 'who', 'are', 'black', 'policewoman', 'who', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'ups', 'ante', 'season', 'trying', 'recruit', 'partner', 'informer', 'meanwhile', 'Luther', 'busy', 'solving', 'cases', 'Indris', 'Elba', 'who', 'Luther', 'terrific', 'actor', 'now', 'starring', 'movies', 'well', 'Netflix', 'streaming', 'also', 'series', 'i', 'love', 'music', 'series', 'too.the', 'humdinger', 'story', 'series', 'vigilante', 'tom', 'marwood', 'who', 'trying', 'avenge', 'murdered', 'wife', 'murdering', 'criminals', 'initially', 'sympathetic', 'tom', 'more', 'control', 'menace', 'society', 'general', 'Luther', 'particular', 'episode', 'also', 'see', 'return', 'red', 'haired', 'Alice', 'who', 'out', 'Luther', 'even', 'criminal', 'fugitive', 'Luther', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'mary', 'i', 'frankly', 'can', 'see', 'Alice', 'only', 'one', 'aspect', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'i', 'suspect', 'personal', 'i', 'have', 'put', 'spoiler', 'below.update', 'POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS', 'one', 'frequent', 'readers', 'took', 'task', 'short', 'review', 'Luther', 'i', 'commented', 'back', 'something', 'had', 'bothered', 'season', 'three', 'i', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'i', 'have', 'now', 'figured', 'i', 'am', 'rather', 'surprised', 'what', 'series', 'Luther', 'heavy', 'involvement', 'cases', 'two', 'cops', 'doing', 'internal', 'affairs', 'investigation', 'trying', 'get', 'dismissed', 'i', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Rebus', 'Ian', 'Rankin', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'new', 'series', 'internal', 'affairs', 'cop', 'stopped', 'reading', 'i', 'loved', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'TRAINING', 'DAY', 'where', 'won', 'Oscar', 'playing', 'cop', 'gone', 'bad', 'Other', 'film', 'however', 'really', 'hate', 'tv', 'shows', 'incompetent', 'cops', 'trying', 'remove', 'someone', 'who', 'getting', 'job', 'done', 'absolutely', 'HATED', 'black', 'woman', 'policeman', 'Scot', 'male', 'policeman', 'who', 'coarse', 'heavy', 'handed', 'methods', 'investigate', 'Luther', 'i', 'think', 'moral', 'i', 'personally', 'am', 'done', 'internal', 'affairs', 'plotlines', 'are', 'not', 'otherwise', 'up', 'excellent', 'standards', 'prior', 'two', 'seasons', 'good', 'conscience', 'i', 'can', 'not', 'mark', 'something', 'down', 'something', 'hitting', 'own', 'personal', 'buttons']",Luther - Series 3 anglais

I adored Seasons One (1) and two (2) so very much never expecting a Season Three (3) BUT here it is and it's sublime.  Of course, this season is very well written with great British murder/mysteries for the very intense and wonderful British detective Luther to ""get to the bottom of"".

Elba brings superb acting to his role of Luther (as previously) in Season Three (3)--my god, he's so very good!  YES, Luther's nemesis Alice (fabulously and frightenly acted by Ruth Wilson) is back with her crazy self to torture Luther--the scenes between Alice and Luther set the screen on fire.  As a previous reviewer so succinctly phrased it: Ruth Wilson, as Alice, certainly ""nails"" it. She makes a ""breathtaking"" entrance and begins to dominate the screen and proceedings from that point on--Brava!!!In Season Three (3), Luther not only has crimes to deal with but has ""Internal "" tensions/investigations to deal with along with those intent on ""getting him"".

1645602,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00CBMWLU2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[11, 11]","Like most people, I've been a huge fan of the ""Luther"" series and its rogue hero John Luther as portrayed by Idris Elba.  It's hard to believe that we're on Season Three of ""Luther.""  Of course, Season One was only six episodes and Season Two was only four episodes!  Some have contended that ""Luther"" is unlike any other show on TV, and I'm not entirely sure that I would agree with this assessment. While ""Luther"" can certainly be wild and unpredictable, it is not breaking the mold of many other cop shows that have populated the modern TV landscape. But Idris Elba brings much passion, conviction, and gusto to the standard role of a cop who must sometimes cross the line to do what's right. But to the program's credit, Elba can be extremely erratic as well and does push the notion of a ""good"" cop to an uncomfortable, and at times, violent level. It is this anything-may-happen feel that livens up even the most standard of cases. And it is this volatility that has scored Elba a Golden Globe Award and two EMMY nominations.To me, Season One succeeded as a wild and over-the-top ride as Luther became increasingly unhinged throughout the episodes.  It also introduced Ruth Wilson as the cunning murderess Alice.  Her unsettling bond with Luther, to me, has always been the dramatic high point of the series.  Season Two was missing some of the dynamic interplay between Luther and Alice that I loved, but the cases were viciously messy, disturbing, and utterly memorable.  Therefore, I was expecting a lot from Season Three.  And while I enjoyed the four new episodes (there are essentially two two-parters), it wasn't until the second case that the show ramped up and amped up to the grand entertainment I was anticipating.  The first two episodes deal with a copy cat killer with ties to a string of murders many decades in the past.  While this was perfectly serviceable (with one killer scene in the attic), I felt like I had seen the exact same story line numerous times on other shows.  Likewise, the second case starts off as a traditional vigilante plot line.  As it progresses, though, it gets bigger and twistier (but less believable).  What makes ""Luther"" so great, though, is that it teeters on the brink of madness (just like its titular character) and that's what makes it fun.  And the grand finale provided glorious insanity in spades.  I loved it.There were also some continuing story threads.  Nikki Amuka-Bird returns as the British equivalent of Internal Affairs.  She is consumed by her desire to bring an unchecked Luther to justice, and she throws her lot in with an unscrupulous investigator.  Luther also finds himself in a burgeoning relationship with a local shopkeeper.  I wasn't particularly fond of either of these developments to be perfectly honest.  The investigation into Luther is great material, to be sure.  But so many procedural lines were crossed, it simply got a bit ridiculous.  It did, however, give Warren Brown (DS Ripley) a chance to expand his character arc in a pleasing way.  And the romance seemed a matter of convenience, just someone to put in jeopardy when the time was right.  Guest actors Elliott Cowan as the vigilante (episodes 3 and 4) and Lucian Msamati as a murdered girl's father (episodes 1 and 2) give strong and memorable performances.  Ultimately, though, it's Elba's show and that's always worth the price of admission.  And a late surprise really makes it worth the investment!

It seems John Luther, played by Idris Elba, the rogue policeman, is his description, will always be on the outside looking in. The man who cares too much about the crimes of injustice, just does not have enough time to look for his own life. That seems to be the way with the stand out English Detective series, something keeps these cops from fulfilling their lives.This time, Luther has a lot going on. He has an old murder case that has come alive, and quite a strange one at that. John Stark from another detective series, has come out of retirement to pursue Luther for who knows what. Someone in Internal Affairs has a thing about Luther. This part of this series was so far fetched, in my opinion, it never should have been included. It detracted from anything sensible, and the unbridled violence from Stark was not conducive to the tale. Luther's partner may be off track, and Luther really wants to share his life with someone. Luther is an excellent detective, knows his job, but seems to have very little insight into himself.And, then, along comes Alice Morgan, played by Ruth Wilson, that delicious sociopath. The killer who loves Luther or something like that. She brightens up the series with her wit and cleverness. She is exactly what the series was missing. I loved watching her, Ruth Wilson can become her character, the look, the wink, the raise of the eyebrow. This woman deserves a show of her own. But back to Luther, Alice can do what Luther can't, and the combination makes a perfectly fine pair.

This was an amazing British series that I watched because Idris was in it, plain and simple.  I am one of a million women that would watch anything he's in.  But you stay for Luther because of the superb writing, acting and Alice.  I hear there will be a movie.  Can't wait.  And I hope they are smart enough to have Alice in that as well.

It's still very well written with a group of terrific actors. But I found the episodes to be not as edgy as the previous 2 seasons. The storytelling style is different, slightly more similar to other crime/detective TV shows. I consider this season the &#34;Terminator 2&#34; season for Luther.  Luther turns from a good cop/detective willing to do occasional bad things, to get &#34;just&#34; or morally correct results -- into a good detective who gets the job done. This isn't a bad thing, completely. It's just a bit more of a watered down Luther than I'm used to.It may come from the fact that Idris Alba is now working with/for Disney/Marvel, and must become more of a heroic character actor than before. Still, Alba is a great actor in any role.",4,"Still a great show, but not as edgy as past seasons",1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,821,"['think', 'Luther', 'gone', 'changes', 'third', 'season', 'still', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'group', 'terrific', 'actors', 'found', 'episodes', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'edgy', 'previous', '2', 'seasons', 'storytelling', 'style', 'different', 'slightly', 'more', 'similar', 'other', 'crime/detective', 'TV', 'shows', 'consider', 'season', '34', 'Terminator', '2', '34', 'season', 'Luther', 'Luther', 'good', 'cop/detective', 'willing', 'do', 'occasional', 'bad', 'things', 'get', '34', 'just', '34', 'morally', 'correct', 'results', 'good', 'detective', 'who', 'job', 'done', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'completely', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'watered', 'down', 'Luther', ""'m"", 'used', 'to.It', 'may', 'come', 'fact', 'Idris', 'Alba', 'now', 'working', 'with/for', 'Disney/Marvel', 'must', 'become', 'more', 'heroic', 'character', 'actor', 'before', 'Still', 'Alba', 'great', 'actor', 'role']",Luther - Series 3 anglais
