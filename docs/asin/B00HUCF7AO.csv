The interesting thing is that most of the characters are played by Tatiana Mazlany.The main character, Sarah Manning, is a grafter and petty criminal who lives with her gay foster brother, Felix. Sarah is the mother of a young child, Kira, who is living with Sarah's foster mother because Sarah has been unable to care for the child.One day, Sarah is standing near a train line when she sees a woman who strongly resembles Sarah. The woman is talking excitedly on a phone, but then hangs up and jumps in front of the train. Sarah takes advantage of the opportunity to steal her handbag. She finds that the dead woman is a dead ringer for herself, so eventually, Sarah assumes her identity as a policewoman named Beth Childs. You can see how the complexity ensues.It doesn't take long for Sarah to learn that she is one of numerous clones, all of whom have different personalities and interests and all of whom are played by Ms. Mazlany. Of course, the show includes the obligatory evil corporation which is unrestrained by any laws, and the obligatory powerful religious cult, also heedless of law. So Sarah s off to learn about and fight them all, as well as protect her daughter, her foster brother, and the other clones.This is an excellent fast paced action series.",5,A nice little action program,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,1371,"['show', 'science', 'fiction', 'premise', 'story', 'advanced', 'character', 'development', 'interesting', 'thing', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'Tatiana', 'Mazlany.The', 'main', 'character', 'Sarah', 'Manning', 'grafter', 'petty', 'criminal', 'who', 'gay', 'foster', 'brother', 'Felix', 'Sarah', 'mother', 'young', 'child', 'Kira', 'who', 'living', 'Sarah', 'foster', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'been', 'unable', 'care', 'child.One', 'day', 'Sarah', 'standing', 'train', 'line', 'when', 'woman', 'who', 'strongly', 'Sarah', 'woman', 'talking', 'excitedly', 'phone', 'then', 'up', 'jumps', 'front', 'train', 'Sarah', 'advantage', 'opportunity', 'steal', 'handbag', 'dead', 'woman', 'dead', 'ringer', 'herself', 'so', 'eventually', 'Sarah', 'identity', 'policewoman', 'named', 'Beth', 'Childs', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'complexity', 'ensues.It', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'Sarah', 'learn', 'one', 'numerous', 'clones', 'whom', 'have', 'different', 'personalities', 'interests', 'whom', 'are', 'played', 'Ms.', 'Mazlany', 'course', 'show', 'obligatory', 'evil', 'corporation', 'unrestrained', 'laws', 'obligatory', 'powerful', 'religious', 'cult', 'also', 'heedless', 'law', 'So', 'Sarah', 's', 'learn', 'fight', 'as', 'well', 'protect', 'daughter', 'foster', 'brother', 'other', 'clones.This', 'excellent', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'series']",Orphan Black: Season 2

Tatiana Maslany is simply amazing; she is an incredibly talented and gifted actor. She makes the show, but the writing -- especially the dialog, the production -- for instance the music and sets -- and the roller coaster plot make this one of the best  TV shows out there. I would put it in the same league as X-Files, which in my mind is an all-time high point in television. Another attractive feature here is the complexity of characters as they transition from good to evil and back again. Characters who enter as repugnant are often rehabilitated as their story unfolds and the writing masterfully keeps the audience on-board through these transitions. This show is a mix of ordinary suspense joined with the real looming complications introduced by synthetic biology all navigated by an ingenious but not invulnerable heroine.

1692262,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00HUCF7AO,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","Sarah Manning and her 'sisters', Cosima and Alison, find their loyalties divided when Sarah's daughter Kira disappears. Sarah believes that the Dyad Institute, which Cosima works for, is responsible, whilst it appears that a group of fanatics known as the Proletheans may also be trying to hurt Sarah and her newfound family. Secrets from thirty years ago re-emerge as all the factions involved in this struggle try to find the secret to flawless genetic engineering, no matter the cost.Orphan Black's first season was the undoubted SF TV highlight of 2013, with Tatiana Maslany turning in a powerhouse performance as multiple versions of the same character. Some clever writing and strong supporting turns, not to mention pitch-perfect pacing, made the show even better. This second season has a lot to live up to.For the most part, it works. The pacing remains strong and the writers do an excellent job of answering past mysteries whilst making new revelations and setting up fresh puzzles. They also resist the urge to play &#34;Clone of the Week&#34;, instead restricting themselves to exploring the character of Rachel (introduced at the end of Season 1) and briefly touching on the lives of two other clones (one solely, but still heartbreakingly, through video diaries). Other characters like Dr. Leekie, Alison's troubled husband Donnie and the ever-more-formidable Mrs. S are fleshed out further and there's some strong newcomers in the form of Michael Huisman as Cal (impressing more than his recent, underwritten appearance on Game of Thrones, it has to be said), Michelle Forbes as Marion and Ari Millen as Mark Rollins. There's still a rich vein of humour, particularly in Alison and Felix's stories, as well as tenderness. The romance between Cosima and Delphine is particularly well-handled.Elsewhere, the show can't quite match the first season's near-effortless-seeming grace. Some characters get lost in the mix for long periods, with Art and Paul not getting very much to do. One character's return from the dead is highly unconvincing, although it does eventually lead to some of the best scenes in the series to date. The series also flirts with M. Night Shyamalanisms with the Village-esque scenes at the Prolethean farm going on for a bit too long. Also, the threat of Kira constantly being kidnapped gets old quickly and starts to get a bit too reminiscent of Hera in Battlestar Galactica. There's also a feeling that Vic gets parachuted into the show again when he doesn't really have much of a reason for being there beyond fan service, but given that his story is pretty funny we can forgive that.If its second season is a little bit more inconsistent than the first, Orphan Black (****) still remains the best SFF show on television thanks to its clever writing, dark humour (including the most wince-inducing death scene I've ever seen in anything) and its outrageously good performances, particularly from its leading lady.

Felix, the faithful gay friend, is back as well. I like him best when he is with Alison too. They are funny together.

Sarah has a very big role and she gets in the most fixes of any of them. However, her clone ""sister"" a Russian terminator is great at killing off anyone who gets in Sarah's way.

1692280,A3DN9249F3X716,B00HUCF7AO,Corey Lidster,"[2, 2]","Second Seasons are tough, especially trying to follow the stellar 10 episode run that introduced Orphan Black. Tatiana Maslany blew everyone away with a bravura display of MPD-acting, a feat that I doubt many actresses could have pulled off. Her portrayals of Sarah, Cosima, Helena, et al, were amazingly fleshed out, believable characters that were in some cases so profoundly different that you could forget they were being played by the same actress. As great as Maslany was in Season 1, however, she was not a one-man-band; the writing on the series has been excellent, managing the difficult task of keeping the action fresh and unpredictable. And although the very premise of Orphan Black is a favorite science fiction 'deus ex machina' device for lazy hacks (clones, a long lost evil twin, amnesia, time travel, psychic premonitions...), this has been a fairly realistic show. Cloning is a very real thing, and although the conspiracies and cover-ups are very obviously fictional, there's nothing that has occurred in Orphan Black that couldn't have happened in our world. The writers and directors realized this, and treated the series like the thriller it is, full of secrets and intrigue and betrayals. And then there was the supporting cast, made up largely of Canadians, like Maslany, who could easily be forgotten if they didn't do such amazing jobs themselves, creating unforgettable characters like Felix and Vic.Orphan Black survived it's Second Season crucible admirably, however. The writing and directing is just as sharp, taking the viewer deeper into the history of Project Leda, introducing new characters and groups with nefarious goals of their own. The Dyad Corporation sees some internal power struggles, and the various clones face dangers on all sides. That's about all you can say without throwing around spoilers, and this is the kind of show where spoilers are truly aggravating.

1692300,A1V3TRGWOMA8LC,B00HUCF7AO,"James Beswick ""Thanks for your time""","[8, 11]","Orphan Black is one of those rare shows that hit the ground running in its first season and quickly established itself as a smartly written, well-plotted mystery that executes a gimmick flawlessly. Tatiana was clearly overlooked in the awards for her ability to play multiples characters so convincingly that you often completely forget that all the primary players are the same person. Throw in the typical BBC style of delivering understated subtlety (in the midst of clones) and you have an intelligent, unique show that didn't paint itself into a corner and kept the audience guessing.Fast forward to season two and apart from the exceptional lead actress, it's like they fired all the original writers and decided to jump the shark during the season break. There has been an explosion of weak secondary characters introduced for no reason other than to create B plots - from the cliched nutty religious group to the horribly cliched evil genetics company run seemingly by a handful of people and headed by one kindly grandfatherly (but evil) guy, it's hard to engage seriously with any of these 2-dimensional setups.Season 2 has failed to create a central dramatic question and has instead opted to use poor dialog to create weak tension that only serves to get the audience to the next scene. The dialog has devolved into exposition where at any given time characters are explaining backstory to the audience, searching for something or trying to find someone that introduces the next step of the odyssey. And the problem with this is that it's lost the dramatic tension that made the audience care in the first place, and now characters are making illogical decisions and operating in a consequence-free vacuum.I delayed writing this review in the hopes that the episodes would get back on track but at this point it seems to be a lost season. I can only hope that if it gets renewed they have a serious rethink about how bring back the elements that made the first few episodes so engaging. Take away the extraordinary acting ability of Tatiana Maslany and it's pretty clear that this entire season has been treading water.",3,A totally different show in season 2,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,2131,"['Orphan', 'Black', 'one', 'rare', 'shows', 'hit', 'ground', 'running', 'first', 'season', 'quickly', 'established', 'smartly', 'written', 'well-plotted', 'mystery', 'gimmick', 'flawlessly', 'Tatiana', 'was', 'clearly', 'overlooked', 'awards', 'ability', 'play', 'multiples', 'characters', 'so', 'convincingly', 'often', 'completely', 'forget', 'primary', 'players', 'are', 'same', 'person', 'Throw', 'typical', 'BBC', 'style', 'delivering', 'understated', 'subtlety', 'midst', 'clones', 'have', 'intelligent', 'unique', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'paint', 'corner', 'kept', 'audience', 'guessing.Fast', 'forward', 'season', 'two', 'apart', 'exceptional', 'lead', 'actress', 'fired', 'original', 'writers', 'decided', 'jump', 'shark', 'season', 'break', 'been', 'explosion', 'weak', 'secondary', 'characters', 'introduced', 'reason', 'other', 'create', 'B', 'plots', 'cliched', 'nutty', 'religious', 'group', 'horribly', 'cliched', 'evil', 'genetics', 'company', 'run', 'seemingly', 'handful', 'people', 'headed', 'one', 'kindly', 'grandfatherly', 'evil', 'guy', 'hard', 'engage', 'seriously', '2-dimensional', 'setups.Season', '2', 'failed', 'create', 'central', 'dramatic', 'question', 'instead', 'opted', 'use', 'poor', 'dialog', 'create', 'weak', 'tension', 'only', 'get', 'audience', 'next', 'scene', 'dialog', 'devolved', 'exposition', 'where', 'given', 'time', 'characters', 'are', 'explaining', 'backstory', 'audience', 'searching', 'something', 'trying', 'find', 'someone', 'next', 'step', 'odyssey', 'problem', 'lost', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'made', 'audience', 'care', 'first', 'place', 'now', 'characters', 'are', 'making', 'illogical', 'decisions', 'operating', 'consequence-free', 'vacuum.I', 'delayed', 'writing', 'review', 'hopes', 'episodes', 'would', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'point', 'be', 'lost', 'season', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'renewed', 'have', 'serious', 'rethink', 'how', 'bring', 'back', 'elements', 'made', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'so', 'engaging', 'Take', 'away', 'extraordinary', 'acting', 'ability', 'Tatiana', 'Maslany', 'pretty', 'clear', 'entire', 'season', 'been', 'treading', 'water']",Orphan Black: Season 2
1692301,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00HUCF7AO,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[2, 2]","ORPHAN BLACK was the new &#34;water-cooler&#34; show that caught most everyone by surprise when it began airing on BBC America last year, and suddenly the name that was everyone's lips was Tatiana Maslany, who had floundered in obscurity in small, thankless roles for the years of her career preceding it, but was now suddenly being hailed as one of the best new actresses currently working in any medium. A high-concept sci-fi drama/thriller by creators John Fawcett and Graeme Manson, ORPHAN BLACK primarily follows short con artist Sarah Manning, a beautiful and streetwise young British woman now living in Vancouver with her foster mother Mrs. S (Maria Doyle Kennedy), a feisty, hyper-protective Irishwoman who watches over Sarah's young daughter Kira (Skyler Wexler), and fellow Brit and bohemian foster brother Felix (Jordan Gavaris), who watches a lookalike kill herself right in front of her, and decides to take on her identity only to find that the woman who killed herself was a clone, and that Sarah has at least four other clones: Beth, the clone that Sarah assumed the identity of, was a police detective with dark secrets she kept from her partner, Art (Kevin Hanchard); Alison, a ferocious suburban soccer mom; Cosima, a science super geek, and Helena, a Ukrainian-raised half-crazed zealot who was taught to hunt her other clones by an extremist anti-science group calling themselves the Proletheans. Most of them have &#34;monitors&#34;, or people assigned to watch them and regularly test them unbeknownst to the clones. Beth had Paul (Dylan Bruce), a war vet with dark secrets of his own. Alison has her oafish husband Donnie (Kristian Bruun). Cosima has Delphine (Evelyn Brochu), a fellow scientist who Cosima falls in love with. All of these monitors report to Dr. Aldous Leekie (Matt Frewer), the head of the Dyad Institute, who SEEMS to be running this experiment.Of course, like all great seralized high-concept dramas, nothing in the universe of ORPHAN BLACK is as it seems.In Season Two, everything goes up for grabs. A new clone is introduced in the personage of Rachel, a cold, calculating, and ruthless woman who is near the top of Dyad. Helena, thought dead after Sarah shot her, returns and is being held by a gentler version of the Proletheans. Cosima is sick with whatever auto-immune disease that we learn killed other clones, and was killing Katja (the second clone Sarah met, before being murdered right in front of her by Helena). Alison is increasingly paranoid about who her real monitor is. Sarah, on the run with Kira and Felix, meets up with Kira's former mark and baby daddy Cal (Michiel Huisman). Paul's allegiances switch from Sarah to Rachel. Delphine gets pushed and pulled between her love for Cosima and her loyalty to Dyad and Leekie. Felix has to help Alison out of several jams she gets herself into. Mrs. S seems to have one of the biggest and darkest secrets of all, though.And all of that doesn't even really begin to scratch the surface of this second season, which is perhaps even better than the first.Skip the clever story arcs, the terrific dialogue, the technical wizardry of having two (or more) clones in the same shot at the same time, the incredibly diverse characters and great representation of the LGBT community without making them into offensive caricatures. All of that is secondary to the master class in acting that Maslany puts on every episode. Giving each clone their own unique voice, posture, rhythm and movement is SO good and SO convincing that you literally forget that when you're watching the clones interact with each other that they're all the same actress. It also makes you wonder why the hell Maslany hasn't won an infinite amount of awards for her performance, especially after winning the Critic's Choice awards two years in a row.ORPHAN BLACK is a really good show, but with Maslany anchoring it so effortlessly, it transcends its genre and becomes some of the best television currently on.",5,Tatiana Maslany gives the performance(s) of the year again as ORPHAN BLACK expands its world.,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,3983,"['ORPHAN', 'BLACK', 'was', 'new', '34', 'water-cooler', '34', 'show', 'caught', 'most', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'when', 'began', 'airing', 'BBC', 'America', 'last', 'year', 'suddenly', 'name', 'was', 'everyone', 'lips', 'was', 'Tatiana', 'Maslany', 'who', 'had', 'floundered', 'obscurity', 'small', 'thankless', 'roles', 'years', 'career', 'preceding', 'was', 'now', 'suddenly', 'being', 'hailed', 'one', 'best', 'new', 'actresses', 'currently', 'working', 'medium', 'high-concept', 'sci-fi', 'drama/thriller', 'creators', 'John', 'Fawcett', 'Graeme', 'Manson', 'ORPHAN', 'BLACK', 'primarily', 'short', 'con', 'artist', 'Sarah', 'Manning', 'beautiful', 'streetwise', 'young', 'British', 'woman', 'now', 'living', 'Vancouver', 'foster', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'S', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'feisty', 'hyper-protective', 'Irishwoman', 'who', 'Sarah', 'young', 'daughter', 'Kira', 'Skyler', 'Wexler', 'fellow', 'Brit', 'bohemian', 'foster', 'brother', 'Felix', 'Jordan', 'Gavaris', 'who', 'lookalike', 'kill', 'right', 'front', 'take', 'identity', 'only', 'find', 'woman', 'who', 'killed', 'was', 'clone', 'Sarah', 'least', 'four', 'other', 'clones', 'Beth', 'clone', 'Sarah', 'assumed', 'identity', 'was', 'police', 'detective', 'dark', 'secrets', 'kept', 'partner', 'Art', 'Kevin', 'Hanchard', 'Alison', 'ferocious', 'suburban', 'soccer', 'mom', 'Cosima', 'science', 'super', 'geek', 'Helena', 'Ukrainian-raised', 'half-crazed', 'zealot', 'who', 'was', 'taught', 'hunt', 'other', 'clones', 'extremist', 'anti-science', 'group', 'calling', 'Proletheans', 'Most', 'have', '34', 'monitors', '34', 'people', 'assigned', 'watch', 'regularly', 'test', 'unbeknownst', 'clones', 'Beth', 'had', 'Paul', 'Dylan', 'Bruce', 'war', 'vet', 'dark', 'secrets', 'own', 'Alison', 'oafish', 'husband', 'Donnie', 'Kristian', 'Bruun', 'Cosima', 'Delphine', 'Evelyn', 'Brochu', 'fellow', 'scientist', 'who', 'Cosima', 'love', 'monitors', 'report', 'Dr.', 'Aldous', 'Leekie', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'head', 'Dyad', 'Institute', 'who', 'SEEMS', 'be', 'running', 'experiment.Of', 'course', 'great', 'seralized', 'high-concept', 'dramas', 'nothing', 'universe', 'ORPHAN', 'BLACK', 'Season', 'Two', 'everything', 'up', 'grabs', 'new', 'clone', 'introduced', 'personage', 'Rachel', 'cold', 'calculating', 'ruthless', 'woman', 'who', 'top', 'Dyad', 'Helena', 'thought', 'dead', 'Sarah', 'shot', 'returns', 'being', 'held', 'gentler', 'version', 'Proletheans', 'Cosima', 'sick', 'auto-immune', 'disease', 'learn', 'killed', 'other', 'clones', 'was', 'killing', 'Katja', 'second', 'clone', 'Sarah', 'met', 'being', 'murdered', 'right', 'front', 'Helena', 'Alison', 'increasingly', 'paranoid', 'who', 'real', 'monitor', 'Sarah', 'run', 'Kira', 'Felix', 'up', 'Kira', 'former', 'mark', 'baby', 'daddy', 'Cal', 'Michiel', 'Huisman', 'Paul', 'allegiances', 'switch', 'Sarah', 'Rachel', 'Delphine', 'pushed', 'pulled', 'love', 'Cosima', 'loyalty', 'Dyad', 'Leekie', 'Felix', 'help', 'Alison', 'several', 'jams', 'Mrs.', 'S', 'have', 'one', 'biggest', 'darkest', 'secrets', 'though.And', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'begin', 'scratch', 'surface', 'second', 'season', 'perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'first.Skip', 'clever', 'story', 'arcs', 'terrific', 'dialogue', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'having', 'two', 'more', 'clones', 'same', 'shot', 'same', 'time', 'incredibly', 'diverse', 'characters', 'great', 'representation', 'LGBT', 'community', 'making', 'offensive', 'caricatures', 'secondary', 'master', 'class', 'acting', 'Maslany', 'episode', 'Giving', 'clone', 'own', 'unique', 'voice', 'posture', 'rhythm', 'movement', 'SO', 'good', 'SO', 'convincing', 'literally', 'forget', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'clones', 'interact', 'other', ""'re"", 'same', 'actress', 'also', 'wonder', 'why', 'hell', 'Maslany', ""n't"", 'won', 'infinite', 'amount', 'awards', 'performance', 'especially', 'winning', 'Critic', 'Choice', 'awards', 'two', 'years', 'row.ORPHAN', 'BLACK', 'really', 'good', 'show', 'Maslany', 'anchoring', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'genre', 'best', 'television', 'currently']",Orphan Black: Season 2

The role calls for her to assume several identities, some all on screen at once. It must be a terribly strenuous undertaking. Honestly, she is so chameleon like, I actually forget it is the same actress. the make-up department is awesome at subtle differences in her characters, but it really all comes down to her talent.

HIs character is more complex then the acting turns he's taken before and its enjoyable.(Possible Spoilers)There are a couple of artistic licenses you need to give the story.

The &#34;religious&#34; people in this series (i.e. Allison, Helena, and Helena's handlers) are being associated (albeit, loosely) with Christianity, even though they don't practice anything resembling the teachings of Christ. This can leave viewers who have never read the Gospels with an EXTREMELY skewed understanding of what it means to be a Christian.It's also dishonest and cowardly of the entertainment industry to keep associating Christianity with terrorism when everyone knows the overwhelming majority of terrorists in the world are Muslims. Let me clarify here that I'm NOT saying most Muslims are terrorists; I'm saying most terrorists are Muslims, and that's a FACT. The media and entertainment industry don't have the courage to associate Islam with terrorism, so they pick on Christianity, which is an easier target.And why is Christianity the easier target? Because Christians aren't retaliating with death threats, frivolous law suits, and violent rioting the way some Muslims do when Islam is insulted (e.g. riots around the world over Muhammad cartoons, death threats to Comedy Central for depicting Muhammad on South Park, the murder of the U.S. Ambassador in Benghazi, supposedly because of anti-Islamic movie trailers).Ironically, Christianity's PEACEFUL character is what makes it the primary target for bigoted, anti-religious attacks, even to the point of being associated with terrorism. Equally ironic, because of Islam's history of VIOLENT and EXTREME reactions to criticism, it has become the religion that no one wants to label as &#34;violent&#34; or &#34;extremist&#34;!Smh.",4,"Fantastic!

Really?).  In spite of my quibbles, Season 2 still hit some of the highest points of the series.

(With the noted exception of the two cops. Both are bad actors that overplay their characters and remove you from the imersion of the story)They did try to expand the clone roster recently, adding a new clone who is transgendered and becoming a man. The concept is believable but it's just one step further than Tatiana Maslany can effectively pull off. It was a fun epsiode and seeing her with a beard was entertaining but the whole character was just a device to add some shock value and he didn't really advance the plot. He was more or less a side trip with a more elaborate thanneeded back stroy that appears to be a 1 episode run.That aside, season 2 has been great. It lacks some of the focus of season 1 but it all feels like it's a set up for big plans in season 3. Many many many shows do this and it's not a bad thing. But you spend season 2 watching the characters kind of stagnate while the plot develops around them. Sarah is running from Dyad. Cosima is trying to save herself from the genetic fault. Alison is in rehab. There are advancements in the background that appear to be setting up something big, but the character development has slowed down.On the plus side there also isn't any of the craziness with people growing tails and partying in night clubs for people with genetic modifcations. That was a season one element that just made the plot take a weird and uneeded left turn.
