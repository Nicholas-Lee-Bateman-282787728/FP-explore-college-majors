While 4 seasons of Friends and the dead Dark Angel are transferred to quality DVD before something like Northern Exposure or Thirtysomething, it's suprising to see a show of such quality given it's proper respect. Gorgeous in it's bumbling nervousness, this show is the only television that ever came this close to representing the anxiety of adolescence.  And for that very reason it was cancelled.  Despite the fact that this only lasted 2 seasons, and maybe because of that as well, it accurately and near perfectly captures those couple of years between the onset of hormonal havoc and the confidence gained from a first kiss.  The complete series: what more could you ask for?  Well, I suppose some special features.  Personally, the actual show (and in its entirety, no less) is special enough.",5,Perfect,1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,857,"['When', 'saw', 'was', 'DVD', 'was', 'genuinly', 'shocked', '4', 'seasons', 'Friends', 'dead', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'are', 'transferred', 'quality', 'DVD', 'something', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'Thirtysomething', 'suprising', 'see', 'show', 'such', 'quality', 'given', 'proper', 'respect', 'Gorgeous', 'bumbling', 'nervousness', 'show', 'only', 'television', 'ever', 'came', 'close', 'representing', 'anxiety', 'adolescence', 'very', 'reason', 'was', 'cancelled', 'fact', 'only', 'lasted', '2', 'seasons', 'maybe', 'as', 'well', 'accurately', 'near', 'perfectly', 'couple', 'years', 'onset', 'hormonal', 'havoc', 'confidence', 'gained', 'first', 'kiss', 'complete', 'series', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'ask', 'Well', 'suppose', 'special', 'features', 'Personally', 'actual', 'show', 'entirety', 'less', 'special', 'enough']",N/A

Instead, I caught the marathon on MTV - I watched every episode, back-to-back, and enjoyed every second of every episode. A couple of years later, I got into watching Dawson's Creek and was highly amused by how every single high school character talked like a college scholar. I thought that it was refreshing. But now, looking back at My So-Called Life, I realize that it was so much better than any teen drama today. Angela Chase (wonderfully portrayed by Claire Danes) is like a lot of girls in high school: shy, insecure, and in love with the cutest (and baddest) boy in school. She never used big words, she never tried to be clever or cute. In other words, she is the realistic version of a high school student. She had a wild and crazy best friend, a geeky boy across the street who loved her, caring parents, a sometimes-annoying younger sister, and ultimately the coolest guy in school as her boyfriend. A lot of people thought the Angela/Jordan relationship was a little far-fetched, asking themselves what he would ever see in a girl like her. I thought the idea of their relationship was wonderful, far-fetched or not: it showed young women that they don't have to be easy and dress provocatively to get guys to notice them.To this day, I'm still amazed that this show was so short-lived. It dealt with serious issues such as drugs, sex, violence, and it dealt with them realistically. I realize now that My So-Called life was the clever one, not Dawson's Creek.

723443,A3JCW6YA3C6Z6S,B00006SFLV,Andrew Mendelssohn,"[9, 9]","OK, first the show...  I presume if you are reading this you probably already know, remember or have a good idea about the plot of My So Called Life so I'll be brief.My So Called Life is the story of Angela Chase, a 15 year old high school student, her family, friends, hopes, dreams...  Angela has a crush on a handsome but vapid guy at her school.  Her bright but awkward neighbor has a crush on her.  The show follows one year in the lives of Angela and the people in her life, exactly one year, and ends with a bittersweet 'what if' that is never answered as the show was cancelled despite having a strong fan base.Anyway, this show is perhaps one of the best depictions of teenage high school life and angst ever to appear on TV, and managed to be both realistic and sweet simultaneously.  This is quite an accomplishment given the medium, and this alone should justify a viewing of this dvd set.Regarding the dvd set...  hmmm.  The first few episodes have video that looks washed out or slightly bleached.  I'm not sure if this was intentional or a problem with the transfer.  I have an HDTV, progressive DVD player, etc, and despite this the video quality just didn't seem that great.  Again, I don't know if its due to the source material or the transfer.  Its good, but not great, and it took some playing with the controls to get a good picture.  Audio is good but in my opinion the plain stereo soundtrack is much better than the remastered Dolby 5.1 soundtrack.  The Dolby remastered soundtrack has dialog that just sounds washed out by the music, and from what I could tell there was no attempt to use Dolby directional support: all five speakers gave out the same sounds.  Stick with the plain stereo track, much better quality all the way around.So... ignoring my short gripes about the dvd itself, you should rent, buy or borrow but in any case watch this show again.

723446,A2AU2HM2MW8KDQ,B00006SFLV,Bill Perez,"[8, 10]","I have always disliked teenagers. When I was a child, they frightened me. When I was an adolescent, and was forced to spend most of my time in their exclusive company, they depressed me--all the more so because I was one of them. As an adult, they annoy me. As such, I tend to detest every TV show or movie that deals with their ""issues"". But I must admit that this show, with its undeniably superb quality in every aspect, forced me to reconsider my lifelong stance. As much as I hate to admit it, a TV show actually adjusted my attitude towards an entire demographic class. I still prefer to avoid interacting with them, but when I do, I am much less judgmental and cynical towards teenagers than I used to be. But it must be said that the show's writers displayed an acute sensibility to every character in every age group--the parents, the little sister, the teachers, the grandparents. The writing--and the acting and directing--achieved the sublime task of bringing the conflict and ambiguity of each person's inner life into the audience's radar. It's almost as if the viewer is deified, transformed into some sort of angel or ghost that can read the hearts of people who try so hard to hide them, engendering a profound, almost supernatural, empathy. When I first casually tuned in, half way into something like the fifth episode in its original airing, I was stunned. At first I didn't know what it was--I landed in one of the scenes where the mom and dad are interacting by themselves. The music and camera work kept my thumb off the remote, but I became enthralled by their portrayals. When I realized it was ""that new teen show"", I was tempted to skip it, but I couldn't. I watched the rest of the season religiously. A beautiful example of what good television can aspire to. I was always impressed by Claire Danes--she perfectly braided the foolish self-centeredness of adolescence into the wistful, reflective wisdom at the character's core.

I didn't like the cliffhanger ending.  I don't think the mystery worked, mainly because it felt like the easy way out to leave it like that.As for this box set, it served its purpose in 2002 and I appreciate that.  In 2008, though, there is a more sophisticated DVD set out there, with special features and everything.  It's cheaper too.  This one is obsolete.  Though I'm not sure if the other one has subtitles or not.I gave this two stars because I would really advise fans to buy the new version.  I only wish I had.  It has special features and I imagine it must be packaged better.

Her character's were so true to life that even today, 15 years after the show got cancelled, it still has an effect on people's lives. My mom bought this DVD series for me for my 30th birthday and i still love the show, it brings me back to when i had those thoughts that Angela felt and did those things that they did. Claire Danes' character Angela Chase, was very much me when i was in high school. I wore the flannel shirts, the combat boots and the jeans. And i even had friends like Rickie and Rayanne and had that huge crush on that unattainable guy like Jordan Catalano. The only disappointing feature in this DVD series is the fact that Jared Leto didn't come back to do any commentary or talk about his experience when he was on the show.To this day, i wish that ABC could have at least gave MSCL a second season, because i would of liked to have seen through the eyes of Rayanne, Rickie, Sharon and Jordan more that what they showed from the first and only season.I miss the 90's because even though i hated being a teenager, i miss what it was like to discover new things about yourself and feeling your first crush, that first puppy love that it's so strong you think you'll die, or that first really embarrassing zit or the first time you dyed your hair.This series showed me that i have a voice and i can tell people what i really think and feel and it has made me the person i am today.I would recommend this series to all teenagers who feel lost and think that no one understands them.

723449,ATOHEYPOKGWHG,B00006SFLV,"B. Roberts ""GrayArea""","[15, 33]","...but it was too hard to watch the accurate portrayal. This show was on back when we still trusted our Government. I watched this series with my wife.  We knew each other very well.  We've been around, traveled, are both well read, both of us have advanced degrees.  She has a  Master's Degree in History and I got a Bachelor's Degree in Economics,  a Doctor's Degree in  Veterinary Medicine and a Master's Degree in Experimental Psychology (Animal Behavior).  We've raised  four great kids that married  well, exceeding our hopes.  We thought we had done well and were very comfortable with our methods and results.  We were amazed at how uncomfortable this series made us feel.  The others who watched with us, were of various ages, and also all felt queasy and ill at ease within their own spheres, age groups and lifestyles.  Why?  The entire production was done in a way that would not allow us to lie to ourselves about anything.  All the immaturities, selfishness and mistaken approaches that each member of Angela's family either demonstrated or narrated, letting us hear what they were thinking, all of the squirming that was elicited from us by the scenarios presented, all made the show very raw and real. The astonishingly honest interpretations presented of life and its unavoidable [...],  required of us all self-revelations that had heretofore been quietly buried.  The near-misses and potentially huge mistakes that we didn't do, still,  those haunted us,  seeing the precarious nature of the many variables existing around us all as we go/went blindly through much of life's dangerous  waters.  Many proactive opportunities were not taken by all of us due to fear of the unknown.  That omission of action,  which occurred in many cases, is as gnawing as the chances we did take that were scary.  Each age group's nausea, those of every and any stage of development through life, was brought out and presented to us, having all of the subjects covered,  in doing so, touched some aspect of what each of us should have, could have and/or would have done, or not.  No cell phones... made a difference in many aspects.  The first time I remember there being a gay kid as a regular member of the cast of a TV show was portrayed on this show without hesitation, as just another member of the group.  I am sure, though have not heard, I just feel it, that the advertisers had a hard time with that and is partly why the plug was pulled.  The teenage drinking and the unbridled passion unflinchingly shown when the young people made out for hours at a time was all a bit much  for the Execs and the conservative overseers  of the  production.  It made them as uncomfortable as it did us.  What really happened, as Angela pointed out when speaking of the yearbook's idealized portrayals, was the upsetting book of the year's activities  chronicled in this show's every episode explored more and newer ways anyone and everyone could have and did screw up. This is a true classic show that was w-a-a-a-y  ahead of its time and ended up being too much to bear, too hard to watch, too difficult to starkly realize all the things  that actually happened that way,  that knowledge being avoided by, and  for, those living in their fake, idealized yearbook-type memory lives , a condition which took a lot of self-deception to create in their/our minds as if that pleasant history had been the one that happened.",5,The world changed from,1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,3415,"['was', 'too', 'hard', 'watch', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'show', 'was', 'back', 'when', 'still', 'trusted', 'Government', 'watched', 'series', 'wife', 'knew', 'other', 'very', 'well', ""'ve"", 'been', 'traveled', 'are', 'well', 'read', 'have', 'advanced', 'degrees', 'Master', 'Degree', 'History', 'got', 'Bachelor', 'Degree', 'Economics', 'Doctor', 'Degree', 'Veterinary', 'Medicine', 'Master', 'Degree', 'Experimental', 'Psychology', 'Animal', 'Behavior', ""'ve"", 'raised', 'four', 'great', 'kids', 'married', 'well', 'exceeding', 'hopes', 'thought', 'had', 'done', 'well', 'were', 'very', 'comfortable', 'methods', 'results', 'were', 'amazed', 'how', 'uncomfortable', 'series', 'made', 'feel', 'others', 'who', 'watched', 'were', 'various', 'ages', 'also', 'felt', 'queasy', 'ill', 'ease', 'own', 'spheres', 'age', 'groups', 'lifestyles', 'Why', 'entire', 'production', 'was', 'done', 'way', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'lie', 'ourselves', 'anything', 'immaturities', 'selfishness', 'mistaken', 'approaches', 'member', 'Angela', 'family', 'either', 'demonstrated', 'narrated', 'letting', 'hear', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'squirming', 'was', 'elicited', 'scenarios', 'presented', 'made', 'show', 'very', 'raw', 'real', 'astonishingly', 'honest', 'interpretations', 'presented', 'life', 'unavoidable', '[', ']', 'required', 'self-revelations', 'had', 'heretofore', 'been', 'quietly', 'buried', 'near-misses', 'potentially', 'huge', 'mistakes', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'still', 'haunted', 'seeing', 'precarious', 'nature', 'many', 'variables', 'existing', 'go/went', 'blindly', 'much', 'life', 'dangerous', 'waters', 'Many', 'proactive', 'opportunities', 'were', 'not', 'taken', 'due', 'fear', 'unknown', 'omission', 'action', 'occurred', 'many', 'cases', 'as', 'gnawing', 'chances', 'did', 'take', 'were', 'scary', 'age', 'group', 'nausea', 'stage', 'development', 'life', 'was', 'brought', 'out', 'presented', 'having', 'subjects', 'covered', 'doing', 'so', 'touched', 'aspect', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'could', 'have', 'and/or', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'not', 'No', 'cell', 'phones', 'made', 'difference', 'many', 'aspects', 'first', 'time', 'remember', 'being', 'gay', 'kid', 'regular', 'member', 'cast', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'portrayed', 'show', 'hesitation', 'just', 'member', 'group', 'am', 'sure', 'though', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'just', 'feel', 'advertisers', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'partly', 'why', 'plug', 'was', 'pulled', 'teenage', 'drinking', 'unbridled', 'passion', 'unflinchingly', 'shown', 'when', 'young', 'people', 'made', 'out', 'hours', 'time', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'Execs', 'conservative', 'overseers', 'production', 'made', 'as', 'uncomfortable', 'did', 'What', 'really', 'happened', 'Angela', 'pointed', 'out', 'when', 'speaking', 'yearbook', 'idealized', 'portrayals', 'was', 'upsetting', 'book', 'year', 'activities', 'chronicled', 'show', 'episode', 'explored', 'more', 'newer', 'ways', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'could', 'have', 'did', 'screw', 'up', 'true', 'classic', 'show', 'was', 'w-a-a-a-y', 'ahead', 'time', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'too', 'much', 'bear', 'too', 'hard', 'watch', 'too', 'difficult', 'starkly', 'realize', 'things', 'actually', 'happened', 'way', 'knowledge', 'being', 'avoided', 'living', 'fake', 'idealized', 'yearbook-type', 'memory', 'lives', 'condition', 'took', 'lot', 'self-deception', 'create', 'their/our', 'minds', 'pleasant', 'history', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'happened']",N/A

They use 'like' in just about every sentence and the dialogue is simple and poignant without sounding like it comes straight out of some corny teen movie.

I admit that ""Friends"" usually won out but that didn't make this show any less awesome. (This was way before TiVo...) Anyway, I was enthralled with Jordan Catalano too, just as Angela was. (Did you ever notice that they always refer to him as ""Jordan Catalano"" instead of just ""Jordan?"") I was 20 when this show aired so I was not in high school but to this day, I still like old tv shows and films set in high school. ""My So-Called Life"" is a classic high school period piece and just as entertaining/ addicting now as it was then. I still find myself rewinding the parts featuring Jordan Catalano. Too bad he is the only one of the cast who didn't come back for the featurette. It would have been sheer pleasure to indulge in commentary and interview with the fine actor but, like Jordan, Jared seems elusive and, well, too cool for school. It doesn't surprise me that he is not featured in the extras- in fact, it's almost in keeping with his character. I still liked hearing from the rest of the cast and crew who all comment on the show and each other.I must say that when I went back and watched all the episodes again, some of the parts now seem a little corny. I think one reason the show didn't work is maybe because they put too much emphasis on the parents who seem way more horny to me now than they did back in 1994. I find myself cringing at how dorky they are and how I can't help thinking ""oooohh GROSS!"" whenever Angela's parents start making out. No wonder she never wanted to look them in the eye or talk to them! Rayanne's hair and wardrobe also made me start to cringe after a while. That one bleach-blonde hair strand really bothers me now and even radical Rayanne can't seem to pull off rocking the plaid flannel bathrobe to school. So some parts of the show have not escaped the corny factor. That is kind of like how high school is in real life though- we look at our old yearbook pictures and cringe.I like seeing how things were in a time before cell phones and the internet became staples of our existence. It's refreshing to allow nostalgia to dictate our enjoyment of something. This show is a timeless classic and this dvd set is well put together. It features an extra dvd loaded with interviews and you get several commentaries on various episodes.

Gramme wants his daughter to think hes all cool and Patty is a bit more of the pressured mother but they still let her know their mom and dad.

After becoming an adult, and with all the Jared Leto promotion, I figured why not check out a few clips on YouTube?  And I was amazed.  Not with Jared Leto, but with the show as a whole.  So, I rented it, fully aware that I was going back to the 1990s fashions I have been trying to forget these past 16 years.I was taken back to high school, which for me began three years after the show ended.  And despite the fashion differences, I found myself remembering that some things in the show happened to me.  I had a guy friend who was hiding his sexual identity (but unlike Rickie, he wasn't showing same-sex orientation), the unattainable crush, and the friend your parents aren't sure they want you to be around.I definitely recommend this to people who want to re-experience high school.  Not just the bad stuff, but the fun memories.  There were several instances when I texted my best friend, just because the show made me miss her.

I remember how throughout the summer of 1994 ABC touted this show as the second coming of all things great, and since I was in the target demographic, I fell for it. I remember thinking it was sort of neat that here was a show that featured a thoughtful girl my age who was set to graduate the same year as I was, but then as episode after episode came and went even I began to lose faith that this show the critics kept telling me was so great really was all that culturally important. Week after week, though, I tuned in and watched Angela emote about this and that, be the subject teen drinking, drugs, eating disorders, homosexuality, her questionable infatuation with Jordan Catellano (a pretty darn good-looking Jared Leto, I admit) her declining relationship with her parents (""Dad and I used to be pretty tight, but the fact is my breasts have come between us."") the out of control life course of her new BFF Rayanne (a girl who could eat anything and stay SO thin!), or the loss of touch that had come up so confusingly regarding her one-time number one girlfriend Sharon Cherski. (And what a name!)All that might've been tolerable but the simple fact is the quality of the series seemed to wane and wax with the moon and I and most others from school noticed that this program, supposedly rooted in its realism, lost all touch with reality during its holiday episodes, be it with the appearance of the ghost of a long dead high school student making the rounds on Halloween, or a Christmas angel who imparts life lessons in community spirit. Come on!And lest I let it go unmentioned, Clare Danes, who has since grown up to be so beautiful, was back then simply irritating. Her habit of shedding tears on seemingly everrrrry episode, and the way she'd pucker her face all up to do it, that became a mannerism frequently parodied among those of us who watched. By the beginning of spring I finally lost patience with My So Called Life, and based on the ratings, I wasn't alone.Well, sentimentality forgives much and on impulse I ordered the complete series and you know what? Except for the memories it brings and its jaunt back to the mid-1990's with its fashion nightmares and cultural references,  My So Called Life sucks. I'm giving it three stars because of its ties to my own adolescence, but in my honest opinion, that's sort of like a pity kiss on a last date.",3,Not NEARLY As Good As I Remembered It---And I Didn't Remember It As Being All That Great To Begin With,1190332800,"09 21, 2007",2007,2597,"['Ah', 'trip', 'back', 'time', 'charming', 'innocent', 'days', 'yesteryear', 'miracle', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', 'can', 'take', 'one', 'most', 'over-rated', 'over-promoted', 'most', 'underwhelming', 'let-downs', 'television', 'history', 'remember', 'how', 'summer', '1994', 'ABC', 'touted', 'show', 'second', 'coming', 'things', 'great', 'was', 'target', 'demographic', 'fell', 'remember', 'thinking', 'was', 'sort', 'neat', 'here', 'was', 'show', 'featured', 'thoughtful', 'girl', 'age', 'who', 'was', 'set', 'graduate', 'same', 'year', 'was', 'then', 'episode', 'episode', 'came', 'went', 'even', 'began', 'lose', 'faith', 'show', 'critics', 'kept', 'telling', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'really', 'was', 'culturally', 'important', 'Week', 'week', 'tuned', 'watched', 'Angela', 'emote', 'be', 'subject', 'teen', 'drinking', 'drugs', 'eating', 'disorders', 'homosexuality', 'questionable', 'infatuation', 'Jordan', 'Catellano', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good-looking', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'admit', 'declining', 'relationship', 'parents', 'Dad', 'used', 'be', 'pretty', 'tight', 'fact', 'breasts', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'control', 'life', 'course', 'new', 'BFF', 'Rayanne', 'girl', 'who', 'could', 'eat', 'anything', 'stay', 'SO', 'thin', 'loss', 'touch', 'had', 'come', 'up', 'so', 'confusingly', 'regarding', 'one-time', 'number', 'one', 'girlfriend', 'Sharon', 'Cherski', 'what', 'name', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tolerable', 'simple', 'fact', 'quality', 'series', 'seemed', 'wane', 'wax', 'moon', 'most', 'others', 'school', 'noticed', 'program', 'supposedly', 'rooted', 'realism', 'lost', 'touch', 'reality', 'holiday', 'episodes', 'be', 'appearance', 'ghost', 'long', 'dead', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'making', 'rounds', 'Halloween', 'Christmas', 'angel', 'who', 'life', 'lessons', 'community', 'spirit', 'Come', 'lest', 'let', 'go', 'unmentioned', 'Clare', 'Danes', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'so', 'beautiful', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'simply', 'irritating', 'habit', 'shedding', 'tears', 'seemingly', 'everrrrry', 'episode', 'way', ""'d"", 'pucker', 'face', 'up', 'do', 'became', 'mannerism', 'frequently', 'parodied', 'who', 'watched', 'beginning', 'spring', 'finally', 'lost', 'patience', 'My', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', 'based', 'ratings', 'was', ""n't"", 'alone.Well', 'sentimentality', 'forgives', 'much', 'impulse', 'ordered', 'complete', 'series', 'know', 'what', 'memories', 'jaunt', 'back', 'mid-1990', 'fashion', 'nightmares', 'cultural', 'references', 'My', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', 'sucks', ""'m"", 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'ties', 'own', 'adolescence', 'honest', 'opinion', 'sort', 'pity', 'kiss', 'last', 'date']",N/A

is an episode where one of the main characters has a drug overdose.The rest of the series she continues to deal with the heartless souless demon that is drug use.And drug use is shown for what it is here not glamourized in any way.I know of some people that seen that episode and it scared them straight.Just proves the power of this sadly underated show.And the other episode i want to mention is called &quot;Guns and Gossip&quot;..Keep in mind that they FILMED it in 1993 that is 6 years before the trajedy at Columbine in 1999.I challage anyone to watch that episode and not be haunted by it.And the way they end that episode *i won't say how coz don't want to ruin it for 1st time viewers* is an ending that then in 1993 was just a work of fiction.But in schoolife after Columbine became a absolute reality in most American schools.I know many people when the episode aired in 1993 saw the ending &quot;yeah right that could never happen here in America&quot; i was one of them.But in 1999 when Columbine happened the ending of that episode became sad but true.Unlike in another review here the quality of these dvds are very good.It is a lot better then the video tapes that we recorded when the show was on.The reviewer must not have a very good tv set.Picture is great.Take my word for it from someone who taped all the shows when they were on.Yes the price is high but for a show that was only on one season.And gets NO airtime on any of the cable channels it is worth the big bucks for it.Remember the X FILES sets are $129.00 each when they come out and those shows are on tv all the time.Sad to say this show doesn't get the same air time but it deserves it.One thing though they could've had some extras on here for the price they charge.NO EXTRAS.It would've been nice to see even a reunion of the cast at least.To my knowlege they are all still around (Claire Danes was recentally in Terminator 3).And the shows from the episode &quot;My So Called Angels&quot; onward i dare you not to get a lump in your throat and heart i dare ya'..This is a well acted reality show coz it depicts the reality of teenage life..And teens deserve a show that they can fully relate to..And this is a show that everyone teen and nonteen alike should view..Classic show ahead of its time even to this very present day..Get My So Called Life..",5,Teens Finally A Show You Can Relate To,1075161600,"01 27, 2004",2004,3141,"['So', 'Called', 'Life.A', 'tv', 'show', 'high', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'amp', 'love', 'viewing', 'public', 'show', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season.But', 'what', 'season', 'time', 'when', 'teen', 'life', 'was', 'being', 'portrayed', '90210', 'rich', 'kids', 'mode..This', 'show', 'came', 'along', 'knocked', 'ass..My', 'so', 'called', 'life', 'show', 'teens', 'young', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'personal', 'level.It', 'deals', 'head', 'what', 'teen', 'day', 'pretty', 'not.This', 'show', 'had', 'courage', 'do', 'when', 'others', 'feared', 'trend.This', 'show', 'powerful', 'one', 'once', 'view', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'it.Standout', 'episodes', 'deal', 'everything', 'Peer', 'Pressure', 'Falling', 'Love', '*the', 'good', 'bad', 'sides*.But', 'two', 'most', 'important', 'i', 'feel', 'episode', 'quot', 'Other', 'People', 'Mothers', 'quot', 'episode', 'where', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'drug', 'overdose.The', 'rest', 'series', 'deal', 'heartless', 'souless', 'demon', 'drug', 'use.And', 'drug', 'use', 'shown', 'what', 'here', 'not', 'glamourized', 'way.I', 'know', 'people', 'seen', 'episode', 'scared', 'straight.Just', 'power', 'sadly', 'underated', 'show.And', 'other', 'episode', 'i', 'want', 'mention', 'called', 'quot', 'Guns', 'Gossip', 'quot', 'mind', 'FILMED', '1993', '6', 'years', 'trajedy', 'Columbine', '1999.I', 'challage', 'anyone', 'watch', 'episode', 'not', 'be', 'haunted', 'it.And', 'way', 'end', 'episode', '*i', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'coz', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', '1st', 'time', 'viewers*', 'ending', 'then', '1993', 'was', 'just', 'work', 'fiction.But', 'schoolife', 'Columbine', 'became', 'absolute', 'reality', 'most', 'American', 'schools.I', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'when', 'episode', 'aired', '1993', 'saw', 'ending', 'quot', 'right', 'could', 'never', 'happen', 'here', 'America', 'quot', 'i', 'was', 'one', 'them.But', '1999', 'when', 'Columbine', 'happened', 'ending', 'episode', 'became', 'sad', 'true.Unlike', 'review', 'here', 'quality', 'dvds', 'are', 'very', 'good.It', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'video', 'recorded', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'on.The', 'reviewer', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'tv', 'set.Picture', 'great.Take', 'word', 'someone', 'who', 'taped', 'shows', 'when', 'were', 'on.Yes', 'price', 'high', 'show', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'season.And', 'NO', 'airtime', 'cable', 'channels', 'big', 'bucks', 'it.Remember', 'X', 'FILES', 'sets', 'are', '129.00', 'when', 'come', 'out', 'shows', 'are', 'tv', 'time.Sad', 'say', 'show', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'air', 'time', 'it.One', 'thing', 'could', ""'ve"", 'had', 'extras', 'here', 'price', 'charge.NO', 'EXTRAS.It', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'even', 'reunion', 'cast', 'least.To', 'knowlege', 'are', 'still', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'was', 'recentally', 'Terminator', '3', '.And', 'shows', 'episode', 'quot', 'My', 'So', 'Called', 'Angels', 'quot', 'i', 'dare', 'not', 'get', 'lump', 'throat', 'heart', 'i', 'dare', ""ya'..This"", 'well', 'acted', 'reality', 'show', 'reality', 'teenage', 'life..And', 'deserve', 'show', 'can', 'fully', 'relate', 'to..And', 'show', 'everyone', 'teen', 'nonteen', 'alike', 'should', 'view..Classic', 'show', 'ahead', 'time', 'even', 'very', 'present', 'day..Get', 'My', 'So', 'Called', 'Life..']",N/A

The 19 eps that aired suggested a very progressive and intelligent look at a family from their high school aged daughter's view from her suburban home.Whimsical, serious, hilarious and even at times morbid, the program sometimes occasionally bordered on the soapy or sometimes strayed toward the outrageous. But it tackled a lot of important topics... hand guns in school, illiteracy, sibling rivalry, extramarital affairs, homosexuality, underage drinking, adoption and, of course, sex... and they did it with thought and wit.This collection of the series gives you the 19 episodes. That's it. And that's why I only gave this collection 4 and not 5 stars. I would have liked something, ANYTHING, more! Outtakes, or screen tests, or even network promos for the show!

723465,A30HEGS3MTITSZ,B00006SFLV,Donna Clemens,"[4, 4]","Wow. Honestly one of, if not the, best television series I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Winnie Holzman did an amazing thing by creating this amazing TV show. I knew that it was critically acclaimed when I bought it a few months ago, but I honestly didn't think that it would be this good.Claire Danes was obviously the best actor as Angela Chase, and still, for me, had the best performance of any teen actor I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of teen dramas. That said, Brian Krakow was my favorite character. I have a lot of Brian in me, mixed with Angela and Rayanne Graff. I LOVED Rayanne. She is such a free-spirit, and doesn't really take anyone's opinions besides her own. A.J. Langer NEEDS more work, as she's such a great actress. The other teenagers in the show, Rickie, Sharon, and the infamous Jordan Catalano, were great as well. I didn't dislike anyone in the cast. The most depressing storyline was that of Rickie Vasquez's. I don't want to give away spoilers, but the Christmas episode, ""So-Called Angels"", is truly sad and examines such a real dilemma in our society, especially at that time (early/mid 90's.)Before I continue, I must say this is one of the best DVD sets I own. How they got nearly ALL the cast members (really all of them except Jared Leto) back for interviews, commentary on episodes, and other features was great. Claire Danes and Winnie Holzman seem to share such an intricately woven bond... like they both jump-started each other's careers, and it's fun watching them talk in the featurette ""A Conversation with Claire Danes and Winnie Holzman.""In terms of bonus features, there were plenty. First of all, I LOVED the packaging. It's like a box, and the cover just opens up to reveal, first, a book with a few paragraphs about how the show would have gone from creator Winnie Holzman (she also has something at the end, too, and random facts scattered throughout the episode guide), essays from Joss Whedon, Janeane Garfalo, and more. There's also an episode guide that gives non-spoilery summaries about each episode, music featured in the episode, guest stars, directed/written by's, air dates, and a quote from the episode. There are also full-colored pictures, both candid and professional, throughout the booklet.After that is the actual six-disc set, the first five being episodes from the show, and the last disc being exclusively special features. (Note: There are commentaries on each disc from cast and crew members).The special features really upgrade this release, as if it could even be due to the already amazing show.The show was often hilarious, such as the running Tino gag and Angela's commentary on her life. Most of all, though, the show was realistic. Never before have I seen such a realistic portrayal of a high school in contemporary times. Angela's introspective thoughts were, verbatim, some of my own thoughts and realizations. I don't know what else to say, really... if you're looking for quality television, look no further because MSCL, I guarantee, will find its place in your heart for the rest of your life.",5,Amazing Series,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,3093,"['Wow', 'Honestly', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'television', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'Winnie', 'Holzman', 'did', 'amazing', 'thing', 'creating', 'amazing', 'TV', 'show', 'knew', 'was', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'when', 'bought', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'good.Claire', 'Danes', 'was', 'obviously', 'best', 'actor', 'Angela', 'Chase', 'still', 'had', 'best', 'performance', 'teen', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'teen', 'dramas', 'said', 'Brian', 'Krakow', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'have', 'lot', 'Brian', 'mixed', 'Angela', 'Rayanne', 'Graff', 'LOVED', 'Rayanne', 'such', 'free-spirit', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'anyone', 'opinions', 'own', 'A.J', 'Langer', 'NEEDS', 'more', 'work', 'such', 'great', 'actress', 'other', 'teenagers', 'show', 'Rickie', 'Sharon', 'infamous', 'Jordan', 'Catalano', 'were', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'dislike', 'anyone', 'cast', 'most', 'depressing', 'storyline', 'was', 'Rickie', 'Vasquez', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'So-Called', 'Angels', 'truly', 'sad', 'examines', 'real', 'dilemma', 'society', 'especially', 'time', 'early/mid', '90', 'continue', 'must', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'DVD', 'own', 'How', 'got', 'nearly', 'cast', 'members', 'really', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'back', 'interviews', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'other', 'features', 'was', 'great', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Winnie', 'Holzman', 'seem', 'share', 'intricately', 'woven', 'bond', 'jump-started', 'other', 'careers', 'fun', 'watching', 'talk', 'featurette', 'Conversation', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Winnie', 'Holzman', 'terms', 'bonus', 'features', 'were', 'plenty', 'First', 'LOVED', 'packaging', 'box', 'cover', 'just', 'up', 'reveal', 'first', 'book', 'few', 'paragraphs', 'how', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'creator', 'Winnie', 'Holzman', 'also', 'something', 'end', 'too', 'random', 'facts', 'scattered', 'episode', 'guide', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Janeane', 'Garfalo', 'more', 'also', 'episode', 'guide', 'non-spoilery', 'summaries', 'episode', 'music', 'featured', 'episode', 'guest', 'stars', 'directed/written', 'air', 'dates', 'quote', 'episode', 'are', 'also', 'full-colored', 'pictures', 'candid', 'professional', 'booklet.After', 'actual', 'six-disc', 'set', 'first', 'five', 'being', 'episodes', 'show', 'last', 'disc', 'being', 'exclusively', 'special', 'features', 'Note', 'are', 'commentaries', 'disc', 'cast', 'crew', 'members', '.The', 'special', 'features', 'really', 'upgrade', 'release', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'due', 'already', 'amazing', 'show.The', 'show', 'was', 'often', 'hilarious', 'such', 'running', 'Tino', 'gag', 'Angela', 'commentary', 'life', 'Most', 'though', 'show', 'was', 'realistic', 'Never', 'have', 'seen', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'high', 'school', 'contemporary', 'times', 'Angela', 'introspective', 'thoughts', 'were', 'verbatim', 'own', 'thoughts', 'realizations', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'say', 'really', ""'re"", 'looking', 'quality', 'television', 'look', 'further', 'MSCL', 'guarantee', 'will', 'find', 'place', 'heart', 'rest', 'life']",N/A

I'm not even sure which episode it was, but I caught the tail end of it, and then it was gone.  When I showed up on MTV I had just gotten cable, but I saw it disjointed because I would catch an episode here and there.  Suffice to say I really love the show for its writing and acting.  It can start to get a little melodramatic, but come on, it was the 90's, who wasn't melodramatic.  I loved the little insights that Angela would say in a passing manor.  Because, even though they came off as just a throw-away thought, there was actually some deep thinking behind those thoughts.Today's ""teen"" shows have nothing on MSCL, because they're based in some fantasy world where everyone is rich, beautiful, and only goes to school to socialize.  No one deals with problems that go beyond blank sleeping with blanky, while also with blankwitz.  I mean come on, I don't know what fancy world these people live in, but none of my friends were hopping in and out of each other's beds.

And the clothes are terrible!!  LOL!!!  The best thing about the show is all of the characters.  You really see some of the characters grow.  It is weird, I was the same age as Angela when this show came out, but I didn't have the attention span to watch a whole episode.  I guess you have to be older to appreciate shows like this.At the beginning of the show, Sharon is this snobbish popular girl who thinks Rayanne is beneath her.  Towards the end, she actually befriends her.  Even though Sharon is thought of by adults to be a good girl, she still needed some guidance.I also liked Brian.  He is this totally geeky guy who didn't fit in anywhere.  He feels like he needs to change himself to have friends and maybe even a girlfriend.  He is the total opposite of Ricki.Ricki is my most favorite character and that is saying a lot since I am totally homophobic.  He is the guy that everyone turns to when they have a problem.  He is really kind and sensitive.  The only thing is that he has this victim's mentality, which won't get you far as an adult.  I think it is great that he is an individual and loves to express himself, but he needs to understand that there are times and places to do that and may want to tone it down.  I thought it was inappropriate that he uses the girls' bathroom at school.Jordan and Rayanne's characters are people I don't really have much of an opinion on.  Jordan does not seem to be too bright and uses girls and finally decides to get some tutoring after struggling with school for many years.  Rayanne is this fun party girl who has a drinking problem.Angela is trying to figure out who she is by befriending people who she wasn't friends with in the past.  I think that Angela lacks the maturity to have a romantic relationship and if I were her parents I wouldn't allow her to date.  Angela also is sheltered in the sense that her parents don't expect anything from her.  She doesn't have to pass her classes, do chores at home, or earn some of her own money and she is 15 years old.  She is so sheltered that I don't think that she would do well as an adult.  Angela doesn't seem to know how to set boundaries with her friends-like Sharon does.  There is nothing wrong with her chatting with Rayanne once in awhile and maybe work on a school project together, but Rayanne does have a drinking problem and Angela should keep her distance from her.  Angela also has problems setting boundaries with Jordan; they broke up and she was still doing his homework for him.  And no guy is worth failing a class over-not even Jordan Catalano.One of the themes of this show that seems to recurring is that teens have it hard and should be sheltered even more than they already are.  Angela's mom worried that her daughter would end up homeless if she didn't constantly nurture their relationship.  Personally, I have seen more people my age fail in life because their parents think that they are going to be kids forever and never encourage them to take responsibility for themselves and they grow up and can't handle being adults.  They are in their 30's and are still dependent on their parents for finances, day care, and such.  The other themes I didn't feel that they were that big of a deal.

723475,A33TRNCQK4IUO7,B00006SFLV,guillermoj,"[4, 4]","This is without a doubt one of the best series ever the air on network television, but as is the case with some gems, &iexcl;My So-Called Life&iexcl; never stood a chance at longevity in a TV universe that seems to demand over the top stereotypes, bad stereotypes, or the latest scandal on one of the 100 magazine shows the networks know will attract viewers. Bitter? Maybe &fnof;, but I simply loved this show and seeing all 19 episodes almost 1 decade after they aired remind me that it was as good if not better than I had remembered it to be.The show focuses on &iexcl;Angela,&iexcl; brilliantly played by Claire Danes in a performance that earned her a Golden Globe and an Emmy nomination. Danes is so good that you can&iexcl;t imagine anyone else playing this character, much like is the case with Dana Delaney in &iexcl;China Beach&iexcl; or the entire cast of &iexcl;Once And Again,&iexcl; other brilliant ratings underachievers that it least were allowed to air for much longer than the too brief season that MSCL got. As much as it was Danes&iexcl; star vehicle, the entire cast was brilliant and as the season progressed the show became a true ensemble piece in every sense of the word. Angela&iexcl;s parents are played not as annoying caricatures but as real people who look married and like the parents of Angela and her sister. Angela&iexcl;s friends and neighbors don&iexcl;t act nor look like the kids of 90210, and really look like young adults struggling to find a place in the world. Even the parents are shown are trying to find their place in the world.Although my favorite episodes center around the Angela and Jordan Catalano, there are certain episodes like &iexcl;The Zit&iexcl; (horrible name) that never miss a beat. Although the writers do not hit you over the head with a stick with the big issues it tackles, the above-mentioned episode focuses on how society views women and how few people have it as bad as they think or that others have it as good as we may think they have it. The most poignant moments don&iexcl;t come from yelling, but from quiet truths or what may seem at first like throwaway lines, many times uttered by Angela&iexcl;s younger sister, who is also perfectly cast.If you liked shows like &iexcl;thirtysomething,&iexcl; &iexcl;China Beach,&iexcl; &iexcl;Once And Again,&iexcl; &iexcl;The Wonder Years&iexcl; (the early years), this DVD set is just what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately, the show&iexcl;s producers only got to make 19 episodes and the series just ends as if it were just another episode. Maybe the producers thought they&iexcl;d get a chance at a second season or simply decided to conduct business as usual, but either way neither should serve as a deterrent to enjoying one of the very best series period. Although the DVD set does not include many extras and its not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, I give it my highest 5 star recommendation. If you can&iexcl;t afford this maybe you can rent them or catch them on cable as they are being rerun on some channel called the &iexcl;N.&iexcl; the major annoyance in watching them on this cable channel is that they put up the most obnoxious and prevalent reminders on the screen so it&iexcl;s difficult to totally block them from the story that you are watching.",5,One of the best series ever to air on commercial television,1083974400,"05 8, 2004",2004,3291,"['doubt', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'ever', 'air', 'network', 'television', 'case', 'gems', 'iexcl', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'iexcl', 'never', 'stood', 'chance', 'longevity', 'TV', 'universe', 'demand', 'top', 'stereotypes', 'bad', 'stereotypes', 'latest', 'scandal', 'one', '100', 'magazine', 'networks', 'know', 'will', 'attract', 'viewers', 'Bitter', 'Maybe', 'fnof', 'simply', 'loved', 'show', 'seeing', '19', 'episodes', 'almost', '1', 'decade', 'aired', 'remind', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'had', 'remembered', 'be.The', 'show', 'iexcl', 'Angela', 'iexcl', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'performance', 'earned', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'Danes', 'so', 'good', 'can', 'iexcl', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'character', 'much', 'case', 'Dana', 'Delaney', 'iexcl', 'China', 'Beach', 'iexcl', 'entire', 'cast', 'iexcl', 'Once', 'Again', 'iexcl', 'other', 'brilliant', 'ratings', 'underachievers', 'least', 'were', 'allowed', 'air', 'much', 'longer', 'too', 'brief', 'season', 'MSCL', 'got', 'As', 'much', 'was', 'Danes', 'iexcl', 'star', 'vehicle', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'brilliant', 'season', 'progressed', 'show', 'became', 'true', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'sense', 'word', 'Angela', 'iexcl', 's', 'parents', 'are', 'played', 'not', 'annoying', 'caricatures', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'married', 'parents', 'Angela', 'sister', 'Angela', 'iexcl', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'don', 'iexcl', 'act', 'look', 'kids', '90210', 'really', 'look', 'young', 'adults', 'struggling', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'Even', 'parents', 'are', 'shown', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'world.Although', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'center', 'Angela', 'Jordan', 'Catalano', 'are', 'certain', 'episodes', 'iexcl', 'Zit', 'iexcl', 'horrible', 'name', 'never', 'miss', 'beat', 'writers', 'do', 'not', 'hit', 'head', 'stick', 'big', 'issues', 'above-mentioned', 'episode', 'focuses', 'how', 'society', 'views', 'women', 'how', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'as', 'bad', 'think', 'others', 'have', 'as', 'good', 'may', 'think', 'have', 'most', 'poignant', 'moments', 'don', 'iexcl', 'come', 'yelling', 'quiet', 'truths', 'what', 'may', 'seem', 'first', 'throwaway', 'lines', 'many', 'times', 'uttered', 'Angela', 'iexcl', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'also', 'perfectly', 'cast.If', 'liked', 'shows', 'iexcl', 'thirtysomething', 'iexcl', 'iexcl', 'China', 'Beach', 'iexcl', 'iexcl', 'Once', 'Again', 'iexcl', 'iexcl', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'iexcl', 'early', 'years', 'DVD', 'set', 'just', 'what', 'doctor', 'ordered', 'Unfortunately', 'show', 'iexcl', 'producers', 'only', 'got', 'make', '19', 'episodes', 'series', 'just', 'were', 'just', 'episode', 'Maybe', 'producers', 'thought', 'iexcl', 'get', 'chance', 'second', 'season', 'simply', 'decided', 'conduct', 'business', 'usual', 'way', 'should', 'serve', 'deterrent', 'enjoying', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'series', 'period', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'include', 'many', 'extras', 'not', 'cheap', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'give', 'highest', '5', 'star', 'recommendation', 'can', 'iexcl', 't', 'afford', 'maybe', 'can', 'rent', 'catch', 'cable', 'are', 'being', 'rerun', 'channel', 'called', 'iexcl', 'N.', 'iexcl', 'major', 'annoyance', 'watching', 'cable', 'channel', 'put', 'up', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'prevalent', 'reminders', 'screen', 'iexcl', 'difficult', 'totally', 'block', 'story', 'are', 'watching']",N/A

For such a short run, My So-Called Life made an indelible imprint on American television.  Not only did the show introduce the lovely Claire Danes, but it vividly portrayed a teenage girl's attempt to cope with her family and school.  Not that what she had to endure was that traumatic, but it gave a rare glimpse into an adolescent's mind, rather than simply projecting adolescent fantasies onto the screen.  In many ways, the television show picked up where DeGrassi Junior High left off, an excellent production on PBS that ran between 1987-91.  Whereas DeGrassi was an ensemble cast, My So-Called Life firmly revolved around Angela Chase, but unfortunately was left pretty much in the lurch when ABC chose to cancel it before it had even had a chance to complete one season.

I was in 7th grade when the show first aired, so I didn't really appreciate it, even though I remember watching the pilot when it premiered. Subsequent viewings on MTV, however, made me realize how great it is. It's really the little things about the show that make it stand out. The language of the characters is spot-on, exactly how I talked in high school with 'like' and 'or whatever' peppering many sentences. The characters don't have a brand new outfit every episode. Angela has *one* jacket and wears the same sweaters, skirts, dresses, and pants like normal people do. I just like that. I really don't have a favorite episode, all of them are very good. I especially like the voice-overs done by various characters (mostly Angela, of course). The only complaint I have is the video quality of the eps.

Includes notes from Holzman and an essay by Janeane Garofalo.4) Much better title screen/menu, both aestically and functionally. Each disc opens with a 20-sec famous clip (""I'm in love/His name is Jordan Catalano..."" for disc one; Angela's ""Can you please just explain geometry to me?"" plea to Brian for disc 4)5) Much better, more streamlined packaging overall.NOTE: I can't comment on image quality between this DVD set and the 2003 one.

Still, they gave me an opportunity to watch this series, which I'd only recently become interested in. The series itself is curiously disappointing, as some other reviewers have said.I grew up long before the 90s, and I see little if anything of myself in it. I can't speak for the millions who do, but they've already spoken for themselves. For me it's just entertainment, and one way I evaluate entertainment is by how much I care about what happens.On the surface, My So-Called Life seems to be full of honesty and intelligence. Production values are impressive. I was enchanted after watching the pilot. But after several more episodes I discovered that I'd stopped caring what happened to any of the characters. I was actually bored with and tired of them all.The only thing left that was mildly interesting was the erotic charge between Angela and Jordan, the Claire Danes and Jared Leto characters. But even that felt more like something between vampires than living people. It's not love. It has no potential. Nothing could grow out of it. They're more like Louis and Lestat than Juliet and Romeo.The fact that I'm judging this as if it were a movie instead of a broadcast network TV series says a lot for it. As a TV series it is indeed remarkable and would be even more so today. It's just kind of hollow.

723493,A2BAIBDBM1TP8P,B00006SFLV,Madguy,"[2, 2]","I was so happy to hear this was released on DVD. It's really sad that such a great series was cancelled after only 19 episodes. Watching the show just makes me shake my head at whoever made the decision to kill it off. I don't think there will ever be a show quite like it. For those who are new to it, here's a quick summary. Angela Chase, played by Claire Danes is the lead character. She is a sophomore in high school and is still trying to find herself. She is a multi-faceted character whose quest for happiness and love often alienates herself and those around her, mostly her parents, neighbor/schoolmate Brian and her former best friend Sharon. Her new best friend, Rayanne seems to be the opposite of Sharon at first, but the two are not as different as they seem as the short series goes on. Rayanne is the crazy, ""wild"" girl we all knew in high school and her behavior is as humorous as it is watching a train wreck. Still, Rayanne is engaging and a lovable girl under her tough girl demeanor. Much of the show revolves around her drinking problem and her friendships with Angela and their gay friend Ricky who frequents the girl's restroom along with his gal pals. You'll see a lot of the girl's restroom on the show. Ricky is another amazing character whose sexuality and abusive home life comes more into focus in the last few episodes. Brain is another character who comes more into focus later on; he's even given a whole episode where he does the voice over instead of Angela in ""Life of Brian"". Then there is Jordan Catalano. He is the dreamy rebel-under acheiver we knew in school. Angela falls hard for him and it is often frustrating how the two go back and forth without going anywhere. Jordan, at first acts distant, unavailable and constantly hurts Angela's feelings. Just when you think they are going to get together, bam another hurdle. Toward the end, Angela begins to think she is finally over Jordan, but unexpected events may change that. The focus isn't always on the teens. The parents, Patty and Graham and the adults in their lives also have stories of their own and in the short time we know them we learn a lot about them. Angela has friction with both of them, Patty spars with Rayanne's mother and Patty and Graham have conflict about work-related issues and a couple of women in Graham's life that could threaten the Chase's marriage. Patty also struggles with Angela's choice of friends but that takes a different turn in my favorite episode ""So Called Angels"". In this episode, Ricky finds himself homeless and Patty has a problem with taking in the gay teen until she learns a valuable lesson at Christmas. Angela's sister Danielle is not as ignored as you might think. A memorable scene is where Danielle dresses as Angela for Halloween and even mocks her teen angst. The series came out during the generation x period while it's grungy mid '90s look might keep new teen viewers at bay, it's stories and characters are compelling enough to draw them in. I think it's absolutely perfect and watching the DVD set brings back great memories. I love the music and the whole pop culture scene of the time and it's an excellent piece of TV history. The price seems pretty steep for 19 episodes but the packaging is excellent. There are 5 discs with episodes and the 6th disc has great bonus features that a show like this deserves to have. It's well worth it. It doesn't even feel scripted! It's a truly life changing experience watching this series. I envy anyone who has yet to see it. You're in for a treat. If only we knew then there would be nothing but ""reality"" and game shows on TV now. To me, this is true reality television.

The program premiered when I was a sophomore in high school, and I could completely relate to the character of Angela Chase, who was portrayed so poignantly by Claire Danes. Angela was the quintessential teenage girl, and I remember watching the show and reciting Angela's lines along with her, even though I'd never seen the episodes before. Everything about the show was incredibly realistic by television's standards, and Angela's problems were so similar to the issues other young girls deal with: relating with parents, fighting with siblings, having secret crushes and offbeat friends. Back in high school, I dyed my hair red just like Angela...I even related to her character's clothes: I was all about flannel shirts back in those days! (I don't think I said ""like"" as much as Angela did, though, but most teens used to talk that way, and still do!) When the show was canceled after only 19 episodes, I was devastated. To this day, I do not understand why more viewers didn't tune in to watch this amazing program.Anyway, I am so excited that ""My So-Called Life"" is being re-released on DVD. The first DVD set was ridiculously expensive and was discontinued after a very short time. This new set is much more affordable at just under $50, and it also contains numerous bonus features, including an interview with Claire Danes.

I'll compare it with 'Once and Again' by saying that it's in many ways a dress rehearsal for the later series.  'MSCL', though, has a certain rawness that I find both endearing and entirely unique among television dramas.  The Claire Danes performance was truly lightning in a bottle, and the parents were the perfect blend of best intentions and utter cluelessness. I found myself toggling constantly between nodding sympathy and wanting to slap them silly; it's extremely difficult to strike that balance in writing and acting a character.So it's here; it's great.

723506,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B00006SFLV,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[1, 1]","Writing a review for something that I loved as much as I loved ""My So-Called Life"" is so much more difficult than writing a negative review.  Unlike flaws, the stuff that makes up the fabric of a great television shows aren't as easy to point out.  Good writing, good direction, good acting, good lighting, and everything else that goes into a television show, if well done, blends together in a very organic way and, instead of standing out, contributes to the overall effect of the show.  Such in the case with ""My So-Called Life,"" which makes this gem of a show so much harder to review.If I had to pick out what was best about this show, I guess I'd say how downplayed and true to life the writing is.  There are no huge revelations, no earth-shaking events... just life, as seen through the eyes of Angela Chase (played by Claire Danes, who is a force of nature).  Her relationship with her friends evolves erratically throughout the series, as does everyone's view of her.  Nothing is static from episode to episode, and the resolution made in the end of Episode 6 might be completely reversed in Episode 7.  Another great part about this show is that none of the characters are just fodder.  Each of them (even some of the recurring characters) seem to have an equal share of the ""My So-Called Life"" pie.Speaking of which, I thought it was so admirable that creator Winnie Holzman made the parents such complex characters and gave them so much screen time.  Heck, there were even episodes where I thought Pattie and Graham Chase got more screen time than Angela.  Even some of the best teen oriented shows had the parents reduced to either moral-support figures or foils for the teen protagonist, but Angela's parents were so much more.  Like all of Holzman's characters, they were intensely flawed yet sympathetic characters that interacted wonderfully with the cast.The presentation of the show is unrivaled as far as TV on DVD goes.  Many episodes have commentary, the menus are quirky and reflect the mood of the show (and are backed with great music), and there is an entire bonus disc filled with insightful special features that have interviews and features on all the lead actors as well as the creator, Winnie Holzman.  There is a companion book with the DVD that features an episode guide and some essays, notably one fromBuffy/Angel/Fireflycreator Joss Whedon.  The box that holds the DVDs looks and feels like a big, thick book, much like what the series itself felt like when I was taking it in.The attention to subtlety and detail of ""My So-Called Life,"" both in the show itself and the presentation, is what made the show so great.  There are no big swooping gestures, nocontrivedbeautiful-peopledrama, just a truly poignant, true-to-life story about a young girl. Highlights of this criminally short series are ""So-Called Angels"" (the tear-jerking Christmas episode), ""Life of Brian,"" and the series finale, though--as Joss Whedon pointed out in his essay--it would be silly to try to point out the best part of ""My So-Called Life,"" because I would just start describing each episode.  And you might as well just watch the series.  Because you won't regret it.9/10",5,My Favorite Moments,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,3187,"['Writing', 'review', 'something', 'loved', 'as', 'much', 'loved', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'writing', 'negative', 'review', 'flaws', 'stuff', 'up', 'fabric', 'great', 'television', 'shows', 'are', ""n't"", 'easy', 'point', 'out', 'Good', 'writing', 'good', 'direction', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'lighting', 'everything', 'else', 'television', 'show', 'well', 'done', 'together', 'very', 'organic', 'way', 'instead', 'standing', 'out', 'overall', 'effect', 'show', 'Such', 'case', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'gem', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'harder', 'review.If', 'had', 'pick', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'show', 'guess', ""'d"", 'say', 'how', 'downplayed', 'true', 'life', 'writing', 'are', 'huge', 'revelations', 'earth-shaking', 'events', 'just', 'life', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Angela', 'Chase', 'played', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'who', 'force', 'nature', 'relationship', 'friends', 'erratically', 'series', 'everyone', 'view', 'Nothing', 'static', 'episode', 'episode', 'resolution', 'made', 'end', 'Episode', '6', 'might', 'be', 'completely', 'reversed', 'Episode', '7', 'great', 'part', 'show', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'fodder', 'even', 'recurring', 'characters', 'seem', 'have', 'equal', 'share', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'pie.Speaking', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'admirable', 'creator', 'Winnie', 'Holzman', 'made', 'parents', 'such', 'complex', 'characters', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Heck', 'were', 'even', 'where', 'thought', 'Pattie', 'Graham', 'Chase', 'got', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Angela', 'Even', 'best', 'teen', 'oriented', 'shows', 'had', 'parents', 'reduced', 'moral-support', 'figures', 'foils', 'teen', 'protagonist', 'Angela', 'parents', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Holzman', 'characters', 'were', 'intensely', 'flawed', 'yet', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'interacted', 'wonderfully', 'cast.The', 'presentation', 'show', 'unrivaled', 'as', 'far', 'TV', 'DVD', 'Many', 'episodes', 'have', 'commentary', 'menus', 'are', 'quirky', 'reflect', 'mood', 'show', 'are', 'backed', 'great', 'music', 'entire', 'bonus', 'disc', 'filled', 'insightful', 'special', 'features', 'have', 'interviews', 'features', 'lead', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'creator', 'Winnie', 'Holzman', 'companion', 'book', 'DVD', 'episode', 'guide', 'essays', 'notably', 'one', 'fromBuffy/Angel/Fireflycreator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'box', 'DVDs', 'feels', 'big', 'thick', 'book', 'much', 'what', 'series', 'felt', 'when', 'was', 'taking', 'in.The', 'attention', 'subtlety', 'detail', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'show', 'presentation', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'great', 'are', 'big', 'swooping', 'gestures', 'nocontrivedbeautiful-peopledrama', 'just', 'truly', 'poignant', 'true-to-life', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'Highlights', 'criminally', 'short', 'series', 'are', 'So-Called', 'Angels', 'tear-jerking', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'Life', 'Brian', 'series', 'finale', 'though', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'pointed', 'out', 'essay', 'would', 'be', 'silly', 'try', 'point', 'out', 'best', 'part', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'would', 'just', 'start', 'describing', 'episode', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'watch', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'it.9/10']",N/A

It is poor. The most annoying thing is the soundtrack mixing. If you play it loud enough to hear the dialog, the background music is overbearing. If you set the volume so the background music level is comfortable, then the music drowns out the dialog so you can't understand what is being said.

Elsaesser ""jerseygirlinkentucky""","[13, 14]","From the creators of thirtysomething, Relativity, and the recently cancelled Once and Again, this was a terrific series that aired in 1995 for only one season.  It is about Angela, so genuinely played by Claire Danes, going through a troubled teen year, and about her friends doing the same.  There was so many stories that were so important to the time--one girl had a drinking problem, one boy was gay, Angela just felt awkward through everything, and it all made sense.  But the show got cancelled and left a large void for all who followed it.  With it's resurfacing on MTV a year or so later it caught on again and never let go.  It's fan base has remained and with this DVD finally in release many of us can now throw out our much used, much overused VCR tapes.  If you are a fan of any of the above mentioned shows by Herskovitz and Zwick, the creators, this show will not disappoint.

I never watched it.  But I now have a 15 year old daughter, and I thought this series might be something my wife, daugther and I could enjoy together.So, for my 15 year old daughter that show gets 5 stars.  (probably 10 if she could.)  My wife would probably be 4 stars, and at best, my review would be 3 stars.This show came from the same folks who brought us THIRTYSOMETHING, and the show has many of the same plusses and minuses.  It's got snappy dialogue, lots of moral dilemnas and characters who grow and change over time.  It suffers from overly-articulate characters who spend a great deal of time navel gazing.My daughter loved it.  I assume at some level she identified with the problems of the teens on the show.  She just absolutely got into the ups and downs of Angela and her circle of friends.  (Although we all pretty much hated Jordan Catalano and his dreamy ""leaning."")  Even though she knew the series would end abruptly, her scream of frustration when the last scene unspooled was a heartfelt cry for the ages!!My wife got into it too, although she never warmed up to the amazingly (and realistically) self-centered Angela.  All the teens in this show go around blithely ruining the lives of others.On the other hand, while I enjoyed it okay from time to time, there were several episodes that I just couldn't sit still for.  Ironically, I really disliked the parents.  Bess Armstrong's mother was an unlikeable, uptight woman.  Graham, her husband, was mostly boring...and to me, the two rarely generated any convincing heat.  Claire Danes handled her lead role well, and the actors playing Brian, Sharon and Ricky were all good.  The actress taking on Rayanne was unconvincingly hyper all the time, and frankly, was simply overacting.  Her entire character was built in a way that stretched credibility.  (I always enjoyed Mary Kay Place's brief appearances...there's an actress for whom strength and subtlety come naturally.  Just watch her brilliant work in BIG LOVE.)Again, I admit that as a 44 year old man, this is hardly the perfect show for me.  And even though I found much of it not terribly interesting...I too was bummed that it ended so tantalizingly close to some kind of resolution.  And I do appreciate the hours of ""quality"" diversion it gave my daughter...something a little more intellectually challenging that HANNAH MONTANA has to offer.",4,Tough for a 44 year old man to review...but here goes...,1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,2517,"[""'m"", '44', 'year', 'old', 'man', '2008', 'high-school', 'years', 'are', 'well', 'were', 'pretty', 'far', 'when', 'show', 'ran', 'TV', 'never', 'watched', 'now', 'have', '15', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'thought', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'wife', 'daugther', 'could', 'enjoy', 'together.So', '15', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'show', '5', 'stars', 'probably', '10', 'could', 'wife', 'would', 'probably', 'be', '4', 'stars', 'best', 'review', 'would', 'be', '3', 'stars.This', 'show', 'came', 'same', 'folks', 'who', 'brought', 'THIRTYSOMETHING', 'show', 'many', 'same', 'plusses', 'minuses', 'got', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'lots', 'moral', 'dilemnas', 'characters', 'who', 'grow', 'change', 'time', 'overly-articulate', 'characters', 'who', 'spend', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'navel', 'gazing.My', 'daughter', 'loved', 'assume', 'level', 'identified', 'problems', 'teens', 'show', 'just', 'absolutely', 'got', 'ups', 'downs', 'Angela', 'circle', 'friends', 'pretty', 'much', 'hated', 'Jordan', 'Catalano', 'dreamy', 'leaning', 'Even', 'knew', 'series', 'would', 'end', 'abruptly', 'scream', 'frustration', 'when', 'last', 'scene', 'unspooled', 'was', 'heartfelt', 'cry', 'ages', 'wife', 'got', 'too', 'never', 'warmed', 'up', 'amazingly', 'realistically', 'self-centered', 'Angela', 'teens', 'show', 'go', 'around', 'blithely', 'ruining', 'lives', 'other', 'hand', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'time', 'were', 'several', 'episodes', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'sit', 'still', 'Ironically', 'really', 'disliked', 'parents', 'Bess', 'Armstrong', 'mother', 'was', 'unlikeable', 'uptight', 'woman', 'Graham', 'husband', 'was', 'mostly', 'boring', 'two', 'rarely', 'generated', 'convincing', 'heat', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'handled', 'lead', 'role', 'well', 'actors', 'playing', 'Brian', 'Sharon', 'Ricky', 'were', 'good', 'actress', 'taking', 'Rayanne', 'was', 'unconvincingly', 'hyper', 'time', 'frankly', 'was', 'simply', 'overacting', 'entire', 'character', 'was', 'built', 'way', 'stretched', 'credibility', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'brief', 'appearances', 'actress', 'whom', 'strength', 'subtlety', 'come', 'naturally', 'Just', 'watch', 'brilliant', 'work', 'BIG', 'LOVE', 'Again', 'admit', '44', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'hardly', 'perfect', 'show', 'even', 'found', 'much', 'not', 'terribly', 'interesting', 'too', 'was', 'bummed', 'ended', 'so', 'tantalizingly', 'close', 'kind', 'resolution', 'do', 'appreciate', 'hours', 'quality', 'diversion', 'gave', 'daughter', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'intellectually', 'challenging', 'HANNAH', 'MONTANA', 'offer']",N/A

I am a fan of Claire Danes and as my daughter had reached her age in this show, I though she might like it.  Not only did it surpass my expectations, but I think it is one of the best teen dramas I have ever seen.The Danes character is a sensitive and intelligent girl, who appears normal but is perceptive and full of heart.  Her first-rate acting talent is evident here.  One of her friends is a black boy who is uncertain of his sexuality.  Another is a girl who is definitely trouble.  Meanwhile, she is in the predator's ball that is high school, where limits are tested, nasty cliques are formed, and love sought.  I have seen no TV show that portrays these issues so realistically and sympathetically, without a jot of sentimentality.  She gets involved with a boy who is handsome, but a complete twit, weak, self-absorbed, and not very bright, yet fall for him she does.It is useful to play this in the house, indeed it gets things out into the open like sex, fidelity, and any number of situations that kids will face, whether we parents like it or not.  Many discussions in our house were sparked by this.  That being said, it is also delightful to watch, a reminder of our own childhoods and a window into how things have changed for our kids.Warmly recommended.",5,"moving, funny, realistic, and relevant",1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,1411,"['rare', 'find', 'TV', 'productions', 'would', 'encourage', 'kids', 'watch', 'had', 'heard', 'years', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'am', 'fan', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'daughter', 'had', 'reached', 'age', 'show', 'might', 'like', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'surpass', 'expectations', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'teen', 'dramas', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'Danes', 'character', 'sensitive', 'intelligent', 'girl', 'who', 'normal', 'perceptive', 'full', 'heart', 'first-rate', 'acting', 'talent', 'evident', 'here', 'One', 'friends', 'black', 'boy', 'who', 'uncertain', 'sexuality', 'girl', 'who', 'definitely', 'trouble', 'Meanwhile', 'predator', 'ball', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'limits', 'are', 'tested', 'nasty', 'cliques', 'are', 'formed', 'love', 'sought', 'have', 'seen', 'TV', 'show', 'issues', 'so', 'realistically', 'sympathetically', 'jot', 'sentimentality', 'involved', 'boy', 'who', 'handsome', 'complete', 'twit', 'weak', 'self-absorbed', 'not', 'very', 'bright', 'yet', 'fall', 'useful', 'play', 'house', 'indeed', 'things', 'out', 'open', 'sex', 'fidelity', 'number', 'situations', 'kids', 'will', 'face', 'parents', 'not', 'Many', 'discussions', 'house', 'were', 'sparked', 'being', 'said', 'also', 'delightful', 'watch', 'reminder', 'own', 'childhoods', 'window', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'kids.Warmly', 'recommended']",N/A

First off it chronicled the 'real-life' feel of high school while simmultaneously borrowing from the 'grunge' fashion craze of the early 1990's (albeit in a non-condescending manner).Seccondly, it's characters were neither the 'cookie-cutter' nor 'junior soap' creations of other shows proclaiming to doccument the high school experience. Rather, the sheer magic of the show was the fact it spoke to us in our own language and our own terms.My favirote character (due to her off-beat dressing) was Rayanne, but I also had a soft spot in my heart for Rickie Vasquez and of course Angela and Jordan. I was saddened the later two were never quite as close as I hoped they would become, but chalked it up to the show's intention of keeping things real.That it was pulled by the networks should not be held against the show, but rather used as an indicator to show just how far ahead the show was in it's over all portrayal of teen life.

We might not be as old as they are, but I see a lot of my husband in Graham and a lot of me in Patty.I wish this show never ended. It is a joy to watch. I even got my husband watching it with me. I read the book that comes with this show and it sounds like they had great plans for more My So-Called Life show's. Graham would have left Patty. Patty would have gone into a depression. Angela would have to take care of the household because Patty was too depressed to get out of bed. Ricks teacher would have been going threw fights to keep his job after the school board fond out Ricky is living with him. Patty comes out of her depression trying to help Ricky and the teacher. Sharon would have ended up pregnant. I don't know about you, but all of that sounds like a great show.Even though this series isn't complete I am happy to own it. I lived life like Angela. I had good strict parents. I lived in a nice house. I made friends with people who lived different then me. I was a crazy in love. The scene when Jordan grabs Angela's hand while walking down the schools hall made my heart go back to those special moments in high school. I even have to rewind that scene a few times.I think the Christmas episode with Ricky's hard life is very sad and hard to watch. I didn't have any friends who were homeless like Ricky was, but it was still heartbreaking to watch. This whole series is great and I don't think any teen or even young adults show pass this up.",5,Great Show,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,1975,"['was', 'ending', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'watched', 'when', 'were', 'playing', 'Mtv', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'show', 'started', 'ABC', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'life', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'show', 'show', 'made', 'miss', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'love', 'hate', 'friendship', 'drama.Now', 'am', '28', 'married', 'husband', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'have', 'been', 'married', '7', 'years', 'am', 'now', 'able', 'identify', 'movie', 'different', 'way', 'identify', 'Chase', 'parents', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'old', 'are', 'see', 'lot', 'husband', 'Graham', 'lot', 'Patty.I', 'wish', 'show', 'never', 'ended', 'joy', 'watch', 'even', 'got', 'husband', 'watching', 'read', 'book', 'show', 'had', 'great', 'plans', 'more', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'show', 'Graham', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'Patty', 'Patty', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'depression', 'Angela', 'would', 'have', 'take', 'care', 'household', 'Patty', 'was', 'too', 'depressed', 'get', 'bed', 'Ricks', 'teacher', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'threw', 'fights', 'keep', 'job', 'school', 'board', 'fond', 'Ricky', 'living', 'Patty', 'depression', 'trying', 'help', 'Ricky', 'teacher', 'Sharon', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'pregnant', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'great', 'show.Even', 'series', ""n't"", 'complete', 'am', 'happy', 'own', 'lived', 'life', 'Angela', 'had', 'good', 'strict', 'parents', 'lived', 'nice', 'house', 'made', 'friends', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'different', 'then', 'was', 'crazy', 'love', 'scene', 'when', 'Jordan', 'grabs', 'Angela', 'hand', 'walking', 'down', 'schools', 'hall', 'made', 'heart', 'go', 'back', 'special', 'moments', 'high', 'school', 'even', 'have', 'rewind', 'scene', 'few', 'times.I', 'think', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'Ricky', 'hard', 'life', 'very', 'sad', 'hard', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'homeless', 'Ricky', 'was', 'was', 'still', 'heartbreaking', 'watch', 'whole', 'series', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'teen', 'even', 'young', 'adults', 'show', 'pass', 'up']",N/A

723522,AXKWFTTW5OGJ7,B00006SFLV,"TCG ""playboy2196@yahoo.com""","[18, 19]","August 25, 1994 saw the debut of MY SO-CALLED LIFE on ABC-TV.  I watched the pilot episode that night and when it was over I felt it just didn't belong on television.  It was too good.MY SO-CALLED LIFE was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  And yet it was in the right place at the right time.  Each episode is worthy of a theatrical presentation and I would gladly pay to see the entire series presented in such a manner.  The cinematography by Ernest Holzmann and Charles Leiberman is wonderful - warm and friendly, making the Chase's house cozy and inviting.  Ron Rosen's editing calls to mind THE SOPRANOS and the brilliant juxtaposing of characters, storylines, and misunderstandings.  The show has garnered numerous accolades for its portrayal of adolescence.  It is so good, in fact, that it does not feel like television at all.  Each episode unfolds with its own interesting pace and is its own short chapter.  Claire Danes is nothing short of brilliant as Angela Chase.  She possesses a maturity and poise rarely seen in actresses her age.  She lusts after the dreamy Jordan Catalano, a guy whom she is understandably attracted to but who, in the end, is a true dolt.The rest of the cast is wonderful, too.  Despite their often-annoying idiosyncrasies, you like these people.  The character of Brian Krakow can be unbearable, making you want to punch him in the face, but I think that's a compliment to the actor who portrays him (in a strange sort of way!!)What is truly amazing about this show is that it took place just eight years ago, when the World Wide Web was just coming into its own, and the world seemed still full of possibilities.  The current state of violence - school shootings, anthrax cases, and overall terrorism - today makes these episodes a true joy to escape to.The show only lasted 19 episodes, and there never was a ""final"" episode - it was just cancelled.  Most of the show's most zealous fans caught up with it on its MTV-marathons, but the episodes were slightly cut to add more annoying commercials than you could possibly imagine.  Thank heavens for home video, as the new DVD box set has arrived.  The complete episodes of one of the best shows I've ever seen is now available.The series is spread out to five discs and they contain only the episodes.  No effort appears to have been made to make this release into a special edition, which is a shame because it would have been nice to have had some commentaries by the creators and performers, as well as on-the-set interviews and the like.  I suppose that once we all buy this set, they'll re-release it with the aforementioned inclusions, which is something that most companies do deliberately today.The transfers are the best I have seen for this show.  While not stellar, they are better than the broadcast quality.  It's a joy to see each episode in its entirety without commercials destroying your brain every twelve minutes.  The audio is nicely represented as well.  Simply put, if you're a fan of this show, you must own this collection on DVD.  Not VHS, but on DVD.  The Christmas episode with Juliana Hatfield is beautifully lit and is quite moving.MY SO-CALLED LIFE is proof of just how excellent television can really be.  It's better than just about anything on cable and in theaters now.  I would personally like to thank everyone who was involved with this show for being a part of it and making it what it is.  This is a classic television series that lends itself to repeat viewings.  You do not have to be a teenager to appreciate this show.  I'm now 34 and I still see things that I missed the first time I saw it.Now, if they would only release 1987's A YEAR IN THE LIFE on DVD...",5,"Eat Your Heart Out, Holden Caulfield",1040515200,"12 22, 2002",2002,3697,"['August', '25', '1994', 'saw', 'debut', 'MY', 'SO-CALLED', 'LIFE', 'ABC-TV', 'watched', 'pilot', 'episode', 'night', 'when', 'was', 'felt', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'television', 'was', 'too', 'good.MY', 'SO-CALLED', 'LIFE', 'was', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'yet', 'was', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'episode', 'worthy', 'theatrical', 'presentation', 'would', 'gladly', 'pay', 'see', 'entire', 'series', 'presented', 'such', 'manner', 'cinematography', 'Ernest', 'Holzmann', 'Charles', 'Leiberman', 'wonderful', 'warm', 'friendly', 'making', 'Chase', 'house', 'cozy', 'inviting', 'Ron', 'Rosen', 'editing', 'calls', 'mind', 'THE', 'SOPRANOS', 'brilliant', 'juxtaposing', 'characters', 'storylines', 'misunderstandings', 'show', 'garnered', 'numerous', 'accolades', 'portrayal', 'adolescence', 'so', 'good', 'fact', 'not', 'feel', 'television', 'episode', 'own', 'interesting', 'pace', 'own', 'short', 'chapter', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'Angela', 'Chase', 'maturity', 'poise', 'rarely', 'seen', 'actresses', 'age', 'dreamy', 'Jordan', 'Catalano', 'guy', 'whom', 'understandably', 'attracted', 'who', 'end', 'true', 'dolt.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'too', 'often-annoying', 'idiosyncrasies', 'people', 'character', 'Brian', 'Krakow', 'can', 'be', 'unbearable', 'making', 'want', 'punch', 'face', 'think', 'compliment', 'actor', 'who', 'strange', 'sort', 'way', 'What', 'truly', 'amazing', 'show', 'took', 'place', 'just', 'eight', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'World', 'Wide', 'Web', 'was', 'just', 'coming', 'own', 'world', 'seemed', 'still', 'full', 'possibilities', 'current', 'state', 'violence', 'school', 'shootings', 'anthrax', 'cases', 'overall', 'terrorism', 'today', 'episodes', 'true', 'joy', 'escape', 'to.The', 'show', 'only', 'lasted', '19', 'episodes', 'there', 'never', 'was', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'just', 'cancelled', 'Most', 'show', 'most', 'zealous', 'fans', 'caught', 'up', 'MTV-marathons', 'episodes', 'were', 'slightly', 'cut', 'add', 'more', 'annoying', 'commercials', 'could', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'Thank', 'home', 'video', 'new', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'arrived', 'complete', 'episodes', 'one', 'best', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'now', 'available.The', 'series', 'spread', 'five', 'discs', 'contain', 'only', 'episodes', 'effort', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'make', 'release', 'special', 'edition', 'shame', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'had', 'commentaries', 'creators', 'performers', 'as', 'well', 'on-the-set', 'interviews', 'like', 'suppose', 'once', 'buy', 'set', ""'ll"", 're-release', 'aforementioned', 'inclusions', 'something', 'most', 'companies', 'do', 'deliberately', 'today.The', 'transfers', 'are', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'not', 'stellar', 'are', 'better', 'broadcast', 'quality', 'joy', 'see', 'episode', 'entirety', 'commercials', 'destroying', 'brain', 'twelve', 'minutes', 'audio', 'nicely', 'represented', 'as', 'well', 'Simply', 'put', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', 'must', 'own', 'collection', 'DVD', 'Not', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'Juliana', 'Hatfield', 'beautifully', 'lit', 'quite', 'moving.MY', 'SO-CALLED', 'LIFE', 'proof', 'just', 'how', 'excellent', 'television', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'better', 'just', 'anything', 'cable', 'theaters', 'now', 'would', 'personally', 'like', 'thank', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'show', 'being', 'part', 'making', 'what', 'classic', 'television', 'series', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'teenager', 'appreciate', 'show', ""'m"", 'now', '34', 'still', 'see', 'things', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'it.Now', 'would', 'only', 'release', '1987', 'YEAR', 'IN', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'DVD']",N/A

Every episode here is a perfect example of what it is like to be a part of the &quot;Whatever&quot; generation. This show is amazing for several reasons: the acting is brilliant, starting with Claire Danes as Angela Chase. All the secondary characters all also tremendously well-acted, especially AJ Langer as the eccentric Rayanne. The writing in every episode is incredible, very true to life. It is impossible to not become involved in the lives of each of the characters, and you end up caring about each and every one of them, whether you like them or not. You can't help but feel bad for Brian Crakow, wonder if Ricky will ever find his place, or if Angela really is in love with the elusive Jordan Catalano. Each person in this show is so richly brought to life through the writing as well as the acting, that it is unbelievably easy to get addicted to these shows.As painful as it is to true fans that this show only lasted 18 episodes, it is true that at least this show did not fall into the same traps as other teen dramas like 90210 or Dawson's Creek, where the plot is so worn thin that everybody ends up sleeping with eveybody and an endless parade of new cast members make appearances. This show went off the air leaving us wanting more. The last episode fits well here, because things are at the same time resolved and unresolved. What would have happened after the letter? We will never know, and this only adds to the endless mystique of this show.&quot;My So-Called Life&quot; is an important show for thousands of die-hard fans, and I reccomend to all of them to buy this 5-disc collection so that we can live the so-called life of Angela Chase over and over again.",5,Maybe the best TV drama ever...,1074124800,"01 15, 2004",2004,2029,"['was', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'was', 'more', 'excited', 'find', 'out', 'had', 'finally', 'found', 'way', 'DVD', 'could', 'relive', 'episodes', 'characters', 'had', 'come', 'love', 'so', 'much.Simply', 'put', 'quot', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'quot', 'definition', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'teenager', 'early', 'mid-nineties', 'episode', 'here', 'perfect', 'example', 'what', 'be', 'part', 'quot', 'Whatever', 'quot', 'generation', 'show', 'amazing', 'several', 'reasons', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'starting', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Angela', 'Chase', 'secondary', 'characters', 'also', 'tremendously', 'well-acted', 'especially', 'AJ', 'Langer', 'eccentric', 'Rayanne', 'writing', 'episode', 'incredible', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'impossible', 'not', 'become', 'involved', 'lives', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'caring', 'one', 'like', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'bad', 'Brian', 'Crakow', 'wonder', 'Ricky', 'will', 'ever', 'find', 'place', 'Angela', 'really', 'love', 'elusive', 'Jordan', 'Catalano', 'person', 'show', 'so', 'richly', 'brought', 'life', 'writing', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'unbelievably', 'easy', 'get', 'addicted', 'shows.As', 'painful', 'true', 'fans', 'show', 'only', 'lasted', '18', 'episodes', 'true', 'least', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'fall', 'same', 'traps', 'other', 'teen', 'dramas', '90210', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'where', 'plot', 'so', 'worn', 'thin', 'everybody', 'up', 'sleeping', 'eveybody', 'endless', 'parade', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'make', 'appearances', 'show', 'went', 'air', 'leaving', 'wanting', 'more', 'last', 'episode', 'fits', 'well', 'here', 'things', 'are', 'same', 'time', 'resolved', 'unresolved', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'letter', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'only', 'endless', 'mystique', 'show.', 'quot', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'quot', 'important', 'show', 'thousands', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'reccomend', 'buy', '5-disc', 'collection', 'can', 'live', 'so-called', 'life', 'Angela', 'Chase', 'over', 'again']",N/A

723527,A1WSFHRBY2ZD1R,B00006SFLV,"T. Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[134, 145]","In the Fall of 1994, ABC premiered what Entertainment Weekly would eventual hail as ""the greatest cancelled television series of all time.""  Airing for a total of 19-episodes, with the final installment airing February of 1995, ""My So Called Life"" not only jump-started the careers of Claire Danes and Jared Leto, but garnered young Danes a Golden Globe for her performance (she was the youngest actress to receive the honor).  Years after the show was cancelled ABC regretting their decision by trying to make lightening strike twice by producing similar series, yet ultimately known of them would garner the acclaim or magic of MSCL.  Eventually TV Guide would call the series ""the sixth best cult show of all time.""The premise of the show is simple enough, but yet complex enough to make it unique.  Premiering in 1994, right at the emergence of the teen-soap genre MSCL was a breath of fresh-air.  Unlike ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and latter ""Dawson's Creek,"" this series was grounded in reality.  Instead of glorifying every teenage rite-of-passage for film, the series seems to gloss over these moments in favor of the emotional outburst they produce: much like real life.  Many people don't remembers every detail or their prom, first kiss, and first independent car ride? Yet they remember exactly how they felt, and MSCL capitalized on these moments.The show follows 14-year-old Angela as she tries to ultimately survive not only her freshman year of high school, but the highs (and lows) or first love, as well as becoming her own independent self - separated from the person she tried to be for other people in Middle School.  High School is a turbulent time for anyone from the Jocks to the Brains to the Leadership to the Outsiders.  Everyone has their ups and downs, just like Angela.  But she makes it harder on herself, and yet easier by befriending two outsiders, when she had always been part of the `in-crowd.'  The audience follows Angela's transition from quiet wall-flower to her beginning to emerge from her cocoon sometime towards the end of her first year of high school.While on the outside the show may seems like another ""90210""/""The OC"" teen-soap, but it really isn't. This is a rich, emotional, and movie relationship-drama that once it gets your hooks into you, you cannot stop watching. Unlike most shows of its genre its realistic and each of the major characters represents a person you probably knew in high school. Yet, they probably weren't the most popular kids.  They were the kids you were friends with, hung out with, the ones you actually knew.  It is a downright disgrace that ABC only allowed this series 19 episodes.  More than almost any other show I've ever watched I would have loved to watch these character bloom into full-grown adults through their high school (and possibly college years).But what we are ultimately are given is just this one 8-month snap-shot into these characters lives.  But this could ultimately make this show the masterpiece that it really is.  There was no room for it go downhill, no room for error.  And forever it will be remembered.  It has been years since my sister and I sat up all night long one weekend watching horrible copies of these episodes on VHS, and I cannot wait for Halloween, when I will finally have a chance to watch them on DVD, almost anew.This incredibly comprehensive box set includes all 19 episodes uncut (in their ORIGINAL full-screen presentation) on 6 discs.

It is what TV shows could be if people took the time to create them instead of worry about how much money will be made.I fell in love with ""My So-Called Life"" when it was rerun on MTV awhile back, just like everyone else.  After purchasing the DVD set and rewatching the episodes, I've fallen in love all over again.  How can any show be this good?  It's not just the extraordinarily witty and insightful writing, not just the excellent acting, the complex characters, its...everything.MSCL is real; it's the antithesis to shows like Dawson's Creek.  Its characters are real.  They're flawed, but in believable ways.  It's a very complex, nuanced, and subtle show.  What's great about this show is that none of the characters are given the ""short end of the stick"".  Each character unforgetable and multilayered.  Angela Chase herself is one of the most complex characters ever created for television.  There's just so much to her that you can't believe someone made her up.  Such a shame that we didn't get to know her better before the show was cancelled.  My favourite character though is Brian Krakow, the first TV character I could identify with.  Brian's a sort of tragic anti-hero nerd.  Characters like this have appeared in other shows, but usually as comic relief.  MSCL has sympathy for Brian and gives him a voice, yet does not overlook his many faults.  There's just so much psychology, philosophy, so much depth and genius in MSCL.I honestly do not believe there's a bad episode in the entire show (albeit there were only 19 episodes ever made).  The Halloween episode comes close, but it was worth it just to see Danielle dressed up as Angela and all the unconscious tension it implied.  In general I thoroughly enjoyed watching ever second of every episode.  I'm stunned with awe after every episode.  This show is for anyone who's ever been a teenager in the 90's.  It captures perfectly the defining aspect of our generation.I had the pleasure of personally meeting and Winnie Holzmann, creator and writer of MSCL when she visited UC Berkeley recently (yes, I'm a bear.  Cal pride!).  I got the opportunty to thank her for creating the show.  I think the consensus of the audience that we had our mouths open salivating for more when the show was killed off.  But Winnie said it best ""It was tragic that the show was cancelled after only one season, but in a way I'm happy with the way it worked out.  With only 19 episodes, there's kind of a preciousness to it that's preserved forever, instead of what would have happened, had we continued the show to the point where everyone was tired of the show and no one could come up with any new ideas"".  Indeed, there is tremendous preciousness to the show.One last thing:  Claire Danes is so HOT!!!  How can Brian not be in love with her?  Anyone else notice how her eyebrows curve upwards in the middle like this: ^ ?",5,I'm speechless; it's that good!,1054857600,"06 6, 2003",2003,2964,"['So-Called', 'Life', 'not', 'good', 'television', 'extraordinary', 'television-making', 'what', 'TV', 'shows', 'could', 'be', 'people', 'took', 'time', 'create', 'instead', 'worry', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'will', 'be', 'made.I', 'fell', 'love', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'when', 'was', 'rerun', 'MTV', 'awhile', 'back', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'set', 'rewatching', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'love', 'over', 'again', 'How', 'can', 'show', 'be', 'good', 'not', 'just', 'extraordinarily', 'witty', 'insightful', 'writing', 'not', 'just', 'excellent', 'acting', 'complex', 'characters', 'everything.MSCL', 'real', 'antithesis', 'shows', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'characters', 'are', 'real', ""'re"", 'flawed', 'believable', 'ways', 'very', 'complex', 'nuanced', 'subtle', 'show', 'What', 'great', 'show', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'character', 'unforgetable', 'multilayered', 'Angela', 'Chase', 'one', 'most', 'complex', 'characters', 'ever', 'created', 'television', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'someone', 'made', 'up', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'better', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'favourite', 'character', 'though', 'Brian', 'Krakow', 'first', 'TV', 'character', 'could', 'identify', 'Brian', 'sort', 'tragic', 'anti-hero', 'nerd', 'Characters', 'have', 'appeared', 'other', 'shows', 'usually', 'comic', 'relief', 'MSCL', 'sympathy', 'Brian', 'voice', 'yet', 'not', 'overlook', 'many', 'faults', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'psychology', 'philosophy', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'genius', 'MSCL.I', 'honestly', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'bad', 'episode', 'entire', 'show', 'were', 'only', '19', 'episodes', 'ever', 'made', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'close', 'was', 'worth', 'just', 'see', 'Danielle', 'dressed', 'up', 'Angela', 'unconscious', 'tension', 'implied', 'general', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'ever', 'second', 'episode', ""'m"", 'stunned', 'awe', 'episode', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'teenager', '90', 'perfectly', 'defining', 'aspect', 'generation.I', 'had', 'pleasure', 'personally', 'meeting', 'Winnie', 'Holzmann', 'creator', 'writer', 'MSCL', 'when', 'visited', 'UC', 'Berkeley', 'recently', 'yes', ""'m"", 'bear', 'Cal', 'pride', 'got', 'opportunty', 'thank', 'creating', 'show', 'think', 'consensus', 'audience', 'had', 'mouths', 'open', 'salivating', 'more', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'Winnie', 'said', 'best', 'was', 'tragic', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'way', ""'m"", 'happy', 'way', 'worked', 'out', 'only', '19', 'episodes', 'kind', 'preciousness', 'preserved', 'forever', 'instead', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'continued', 'show', 'point', 'where', 'everyone', 'was', 'tired', 'show', 'one', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'ideas', 'Indeed', 'tremendous', 'preciousness', 'show.One', 'last', 'thing', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'so', 'HOT', 'How', 'can', 'Brian', 'not', 'be', 'love', 'Anyone', 'else', 'notice', 'how', 'eyebrows', 'curve', 'upwards', 'middle', '^']",N/A
