That's the guy Nina (Jennifer Tilly), sheltered, blind, and mildly neurotic, elopes with. Or there's Karen (Martha Plimpton) who spends the entire movie in love with herself, somehow managing to be well-adjusted and cynical - her greatest pleasure in life is telling other people how crap it is. Or maybe the ""love"" of Billy (Jeremy Piven) and Irene (Jane Adams) who  express their affection for each other with obnoxious conversation, personal insults, affairs, eating disorders, and eventually a bullet through the foot. It's volatile and probably not recommended by 9 out of 10 marriage counselors, but it must work to some degree because it has resulted in two children. And then there's Anna (Gretchen Mol) and Eric (Jon Tenney). Or Anna and Danny (Jude Law). Or Danny and Irene (not really but for about thirty seconds Billy thinks so).There's also Grace (Brenda Blethyn) now ill, and Richard, (Bruce Jarchow) emotionally void, as the parents of Karen, Billy, Anna, and Nina, though they mainly wander around in the background perfectly ok with their bizarre family.Danny is a man coming back to his hometown after twenty five years of living with his now deceased military-man father in London - he's oddly enough not looking to marry the girl he helped deliver, he's going to live with a girlfriend and get a job. Both of those plans fall through on the same day, but conveniently enough he gets a room and a different job at a bakery, and even more conveniently is knocked off his bicycle while out delivering a cake to Anna - though he doesn't realize who she is until after he's recovered from his head injury. He quickly and charismatically worms his way into their lives, offering to read for Nina and afterwards - it isn't actually explained as to why because he still has his room above the bakery - spending quite a lot of time over at the Swan house, holding babies, getting mixed up in a feminist theatre group, annoying Anna (the girl he's supposed to make fall in love with him despite her engagement to Eric), and inciting the restrained rage of medical professionals that Billy happens to possess.This movie is incredibly strange and is set up like like a sitcom of a Shakespearean tragedy, where things start out strained and get progressively worse until someone (or everyone) dies.But it's funny without being lewd, sweet without being sappy, and a look at the different kinds of love there are.It does have its flaws. The ending is not exactly happy (but by no means sad), Danny and Eric are rom-com cliches (though this movie is 15 years old so maybe they weren't so cliched back then), and while I know the main focus here was Danny and Anna's relationship-to-be I wish there had been more of all the others, because those were the fun ones that I enjoyed watching, most of the scenes with Danny and Anna made me squirm.More (keep your ears open or you won't catch it) comedy than romance, but entertaining nonetheless.",4,Jesus Saves,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,3061,"['*review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers*At', 'will', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'fine', 'being', 'dishwasher', 'barrio', 'guy', 'Nina', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'sheltered', 'blind', 'mildly', 'neurotic', 'Karen', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', 'who', 'entire', 'movie', 'love', 'somehow', 'managing', 'be', 'well-adjusted', 'cynical', 'greatest', 'pleasure', 'life', 'telling', 'other', 'people', 'how', 'crap', 'maybe', 'love', 'Billy', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Irene', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'who', 'express', 'affection', 'other', 'obnoxious', 'conversation', 'personal', 'insults', 'affairs', 'eating', 'disorders', 'eventually', 'bullet', 'foot', 'volatile', 'probably', 'not', 'recommended', '9', '10', 'marriage', 'counselors', 'must', 'work', 'degree', 'resulted', 'two', 'children', 'then', 'Anna', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'Eric', 'Jon', 'Tenney', 'Anna', 'Danny', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Danny', 'Irene', 'not', 'really', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'Billy', 'so', 'also', 'Grace', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'now', 'ill', 'Richard', 'Bruce', 'Jarchow', 'emotionally', 'void', 'parents', 'Karen', 'Billy', 'Anna', 'Nina', 'mainly', 'wander', 'around', 'background', 'perfectly', 'ok', 'bizarre', 'family.Danny', 'man', 'coming', 'back', 'hometown', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'living', 'now', 'deceased', 'military-man', 'father', 'London', 'oddly', 'enough', 'not', 'looking', 'marry', 'girl', 'helped', 'deliver', 'going', 'live', 'girlfriend', 'get', 'job', 'plans', 'fall', 'same', 'day', 'conveniently', 'enough', 'room', 'different', 'job', 'bakery', 'even', 'more', 'conveniently', 'knocked', 'off', 'bicycle', 'out', 'delivering', 'cake', 'Anna', ""n't"", 'realize', 'who', 'recovered', 'head', 'injury', 'quickly', 'charismatically', 'worms', 'way', 'lives', 'offering', 'read', 'Nina', 'afterwards', ""n't"", 'actually', 'explained', 'why', 'still', 'room', 'bakery', 'spending', 'quite', 'lot', 'time', 'Swan', 'house', 'holding', 'babies', 'getting', 'mixed', 'up', 'feminist', 'theatre', 'group', 'annoying', 'Anna', 'girl', 'supposed', 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'engagement', 'Eric', 'inciting', 'restrained', 'rage', 'medical', 'professionals', 'Billy', 'possess.This', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'strange', 'set', 'up', 'sitcom', 'Shakespearean', 'tragedy', 'where', 'things', 'start', 'out', 'strained', 'get', 'progressively', 'worse', 'someone', 'everyone', 'funny', 'being', 'lewd', 'sweet', 'being', 'sappy', 'look', 'different', 'kinds', 'love', 'are.It', 'have', 'flaws', 'ending', 'not', 'exactly', 'happy', 'means', 'sad', 'Danny', 'Eric', 'are', 'rom-com', 'cliches', 'movie', '15', 'years', 'old', 'so', 'maybe', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'cliched', 'back', 'then', 'know', 'main', 'focus', 'here', 'was', 'Danny', 'Anna', 'relationship-to-be', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'others', 'were', 'fun', 'ones', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'most', 'scenes', 'Danny', 'Anna', 'made', 'squirm.More', 'keep', 'ears', 'open', 'wo', ""n't"", 'catch', 'comedy', 'romance', 'entertaining', 'nonetheless']",N/A

157732,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,0792898974,audrey,"[12, 23]","Yikes!  I'm quite baffled by the positive reviews here!  I really like Jude Law (Gattaca) and thoroughly enjoy romantic comedies, but I found this film so absolutely lame on every level that it was difficult to finish.  By the time it was over, my husband and I just looked at each other and said, &quot;Whoa, what was that?!&quot;First, the movie has a very bizarre framing device: Law's character is asked to help deliver a baby when he is five years old.  Aside from the discomfort of seeing a child reach into Brenda Blethyn's womb, the young actor must then look sweetly at the new baby and say &quot;I'm going to marry her.&quot;  This is not only bizarre, it's creepy-bizarre.  Still, I tried to forgive this oddity and get on with the movie.  Second, this is a great cast that is SO wasted -- Blethyn, Martha Plimpton, Jennifer Tilly and many others in this large under-utilized cast are given a number of quirks but there are so many subplots that you never get to know any of them, or why they are the way they are.  Didn't someone once say, &quot;Quirks do not a character make&quot;? Well, that person was not this screenwriter.  You just jump from one goofy but endearing mannerism or device to another.  There are enough charcters here to make three romantic comedies but instead we get one overcrowded mess.  Third, Jude Law is incredibly talented, but he's miscast here as a young man so in love that he affects his love interest's entire family.  Law is more a button-down quiet guy, who might inspire passion but not necessarily of the exuberant, romantic variety.  Fourth, the chemistry between Law and Gretchen Mol is nonexistent -- two nice actors who are NOT good together.  Fifth, the music is pretty bad, intruding on the film more than accentuating the emotions.  Finally, the DVD features are: the movie trailer.  Whooppee!If you want to see a fun romantic comedy that you haven't heard of, check out Happy Accidents.  This film is lame despite its great cast, and one wonders why all these talented people signed on to this goofy project.",2,"unbelievable romance, lame comedy, crowded film",1069286400,"11 20, 2003",2003,2065,"['Yikes', ""'m"", 'quite', 'baffled', 'positive', 'reviews', 'here', 'really', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Gattaca', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'found', 'film', 'so', 'absolutely', 'lame', 'level', 'was', 'difficult', 'finish', 'time', 'was', 'over', 'husband', 'just', 'looked', 'other', 'said', 'quot', 'Whoa', 'what', 'was', 'quot', 'First', 'movie', 'very', 'bizarre', 'framing', 'device', 'Law', 'character', 'asked', 'help', 'deliver', 'baby', 'when', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'Aside', 'discomfort', 'seeing', 'child', 'reach', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'womb', 'young', 'actor', 'must', 'then', 'look', 'sweetly', 'new', 'baby', 'say', 'quot', ""'m"", 'going', 'marry', 'her.', 'quot', 'not', 'only', 'bizarre', 'creepy-bizarre', 'Still', 'tried', 'forgive', 'oddity', 'get', 'movie', 'Second', 'great', 'cast', 'SO', 'wasted', 'Blethyn', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'many', 'others', 'large', 'under-utilized', 'cast', 'are', 'given', 'number', 'quirks', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'subplots', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'why', 'are', 'way', 'are', 'Did', ""n't"", 'someone', 'once', 'say', 'quot', 'Quirks', 'do', 'not', 'character', 'make', 'quot', 'Well', 'person', 'was', 'not', 'screenwriter', 'just', 'jump', 'one', 'goofy', 'endearing', 'mannerism', 'device', 'are', 'enough', 'charcters', 'here', 'make', 'three', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'instead', 'get', 'one', 'overcrowded', 'mess', 'Third', 'Jude', 'Law', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'miscast', 'here', 'young', 'man', 'so', 'love', 'love', 'interest', 'entire', 'family', 'Law', 'more', 'button-down', 'quiet', 'guy', 'who', 'might', 'inspire', 'passion', 'not', 'necessarily', 'exuberant', 'romantic', 'variety', 'Fourth', 'chemistry', 'Law', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'nonexistent', 'two', 'nice', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'NOT', 'good', 'together', 'Fifth', 'music', 'pretty', 'bad', 'intruding', 'film', 'more', 'accentuating', 'emotions', 'Finally', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'movie', 'trailer', 'Whooppee', 'want', 'see', 'fun', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'check', 'out', 'Happy', 'Accidents', 'film', 'lame', 'great', 'cast', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'talented', 'people', 'signed', 'goofy', 'project']",N/A

157735,AVV1ACH67XI85,0792898974,"Davalon ""Davalon""","[3, 6]","The main reason to see this film is to enjoy how beautiful Jude Law was in 1997. When you see his face, the first thing you think is, ""Now, there is a movie star!""Other than the glorious Law, this movie is a must-see for anyone who wants to write a screenplay or make a movie. You will learn that spending time on subplots is disastrous, you will learn how not to edit a film (why do we cut from Jude and Gretchen --as ""Danny"" and ""Anna"" -- doing it in bed at night and then, suddenly cut to Jennifer Tilly, the blind sister, getting married in the middle of the day and then back to Jude and Gretch in the afterglow of a hot session?), and you will learn that no matter how good your score is (Richard Gibbs), it cannot make up for a weak script?In other departments, why is it that Jennifer was forced to wear schmata sweaters and mumus? She looked like a fat hausfrau who stumbled onto the set of a TV Movie of the Week!  And are we really supposed to believe that Anna's father Richard (played by a lost, overbearing, overacting, clueless Bruce Jarchow) only wore sweater vests in every single kind of weather and for 30 years? Was he supposed to be a ""professor""? What the hell did the man do other than complain and look around for an exit?As for the ""story"" -- if Jude had come to town to work on his ""mosaic"" skills, then why is it he had to leave (on a train to Atlanta?) to ""get away"" from Gretchen?And speaking of Gretch... I wanted to give her every single benefit of the doubt, but... I just didn't buy her performance. When photographed from the exact right angle, she was very appealing, with fabulous eyebrows, but when photographed from other angles, she looked like a cute pug-nosed 30s tap dancer.The screenplay was filled with lines that sounded like every one was anticipating what the other actor would say. Also, characters would say things that just couldn't be said unless they were written by someone. It was insane to think that Brenda Blethyn, an absolutely fine actress, would deliver such detailed, clear, poetic sentences with her dying breaths. No, didn't cut it in that department either.The only relationship that was interesting to me was that of Nina (Jennifer Tilly) and Jesus (Vincent Laresca). The fact that he pronounced his name as Jesus, not Hey-soose, was a running gag and it got me laughing... but more importantly, their improbable romance was cute and charming and I really wanted to know what happened in their lives. I really didn't care about everybody else... which is the enormous failing of this entire production.The cinematography is great; it looks like the whole film was shot over a sunny week or two in a beautiful Los Angeles, so, it's all nice to look at.Otherwise, MFAR is, at best, a superb study in what not to do when you get your big chance to make your own movie.",2,A Romantic Comedy set in the Twilight Zone,1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,2830,"['main', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'enjoy', 'how', 'beautiful', 'Jude', 'Law', 'was', '1997', 'When', 'see', 'face', 'first', 'thing', 'think', 'Now', 'movie', 'star', 'Other', 'glorious', 'Law', 'movie', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'who', 'write', 'screenplay', 'make', 'movie', 'will', 'learn', 'spending', 'time', 'subplots', 'disastrous', 'will', 'learn', 'how', 'not', 'edit', 'film', 'why', 'do', 'cut', 'Jude', 'Gretchen', 'Danny', 'Anna', 'doing', 'bed', 'night', 'then', 'suddenly', 'cut', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'blind', 'sister', 'getting', 'married', 'middle', 'day', 'then', 'back', 'Jude', 'Gretch', 'afterglow', 'hot', 'session', 'will', 'learn', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'score', 'Richard', 'Gibbs', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'weak', 'script', 'other', 'departments', 'why', 'Jennifer', 'was', 'forced', 'wear', 'schmata', 'sweaters', 'mumus', 'looked', 'fat', 'hausfrau', 'who', 'stumbled', 'set', 'TV', 'Movie', 'Week', 'are', 'really', 'supposed', 'believe', 'Anna', 'father', 'Richard', 'played', 'lost', 'overbearing', 'overacting', 'clueless', 'Bruce', 'Jarchow', 'only', 'wore', 'sweater', 'vests', 'single', 'kind', 'weather', '30', 'years', 'supposed', 'be', 'professor', 'What', 'hell', 'did', 'man', 'do', 'other', 'complain', 'look', 'around', 'exit', 'story', 'Jude', 'had', 'come', 'town', 'work', 'mosaic', 'skills', 'then', 'why', 'had', 'leave', 'train', 'Atlanta', 'get', 'away', 'Gretchen', 'speaking', 'Gretch', 'wanted', 'give', 'single', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'performance', 'When', 'photographed', 'exact', 'right', 'angle', 'was', 'very', 'appealing', 'fabulous', 'eyebrows', 'when', 'photographed', 'other', 'angles', 'looked', 'cute', 'pug-nosed', '30s', 'tap', 'dancer.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'filled', 'lines', 'sounded', 'one', 'was', 'anticipating', 'what', 'other', 'actor', 'would', 'say', 'Also', 'characters', 'would', 'say', 'things', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'were', 'written', 'someone', 'was', 'insane', 'think', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'absolutely', 'fine', 'actress', 'would', 'deliver', 'such', 'detailed', 'clear', 'poetic', 'sentences', 'dying', 'breaths', 'No', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'department', 'only', 'relationship', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'Nina', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'Jesus', 'Vincent', 'Laresca', 'fact', 'pronounced', 'name', 'Jesus', 'not', 'Hey-soose', 'was', 'running', 'gag', 'got', 'laughing', 'more', 'importantly', 'improbable', 'romance', 'was', 'cute', 'charming', 'really', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'lives', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'everybody', 'else', 'enormous', 'failing', 'entire', 'production.The', 'cinematography', 'great', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'sunny', 'week', 'two', 'beautiful', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'so', 'nice', 'look', 'at.Otherwise', 'MFAR', 'best', 'superb', 'study', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'when', 'get', 'big', 'chance', 'make', 'own', 'movie']",N/A
157736,A328S9RN3U5M68,0792898974,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","MUSIC FROM ANOTHER ROOM was written and directed by Charlie Peters: the film script would benefit from some judicious editing. Yet as a light love story it is fast moving despite diversions in the plot and in general gives some fine actors good screen time.Danny (Jude Law) as a five-year-old lad assisted in the complicated birth of his friend Grace Swan's (Brenda Blethyn) child Anna (Gretchen Mol) and at that moment declared he would marry Anna someday. Twenty five years later Danny returns to Los Angeles from his home in England and encounters the mature Anna who is now engaged to Eric (Jon Tenney), falls in love, returns to the neighbor family of his childhood where Grace greets him with effusive warmth.  The family is a dysfunctional one: Anna's sister Nina (Jennifer Tilly) is blind and dependent on Anna; brother Billy (Jeremy Piven) is married to suicidal Irene (Jane Adams); cynical feminist sister Karen (Martha Plimpton) is a man-eater; and the father  cares for Grace as she is stricken with a terminal illness.  Anna resists Danny, but Danny's influence on the family is like 'music from another room', and results in positive changes in each of the family members: Nina finds love with Jesus (Vincent Laresca), a kitchen worker who introduces Nina to dancing, love, and independence; Grace opens her longing for Anna to experience passion instead of just caring for everyone; and the concept of fate and love and passion is stirred vigorously.Jude Law is his usual appealing self and makes his role credible.  Jennifer Tilly does a fine job realizing Nina and her transformation, and Brenda Blethyn gives us a heady dose of Brenda Blethyn, which is always welcome.  There are many problems with the film, the most significant one being Gretchen Mol who doesn't take her character beyond paper doll and certainly doesn't seem an adequate reason for Jude Law's unswerving attention.  But as a film it works well enough and does provide some food for thought about the true meaning of love.

My husband and I spent a quiet evening at home watching this one, and we both really enjoyed it.  While the plot is familiar and predictable, it is still very well done, and exactly what you want this kind of movie to be.In MUSIC FROM ANOTHER ROOM, we first meet 5 year old Danny as he helps to deliver the baby of his recently deceased mother's best friend.  After baby Anna makes her unique arrival into the world, young Danny declares that he will marry her someday.  Soon after this momentous event, however, Danny and his father move back to England.  Jump forward 25 years, and we meet Danny again, newly returned to the USA.  He thinks he is going to move in with his girlfriend, but she does not have the same idea.  In fact, she is leaving town to be with someone else.  Fate then does a little happy dance, and Danny ends up living above a bakery, with a job as a delivery boy, delivering a cake to the family of his mother's best friend, where he runs in to baby Anna, all grown up now.  She is lovely and sweet, and of course, engaged to someone else.  Danny immediately falls in love with her, and delivers that classic pick up line, ""Wow, the last time I saw you, you were covered in after-birth.""  Anna does not think much of Danny, at first, but over time, he grows on her.  Will fate intervene again?  Will Danny and Anna fulfill their destiny?MUSIC FROM ANOTHER ROOM is charming, fun, and innocent.  Jude Law is young and handsome, and just right for the role of Danny. Gretchen Mol is lovely, sweet, and actually very naive as Anna.  Jennifer Tilly is excellent as the quirky, sheltered blind sister, Nina, who finds unexpected romance with Jesus, a dishwasher who embraces life, wonderfully portrayed by Vincent Laresca.  The rest of the cast is equally outstanding, and does an excellent job of portraying this wacky, dysfunctional, but loving family.MUSIC FROM ANOTHER ROOM is an odd-ball, funny, wacky romantic comedy that will tickle your funny bone and warm your heart.  Yes, it is predicable, standard stuff, but it is very, very well done, for what it is.  These characters and their story really capture your heart, and keep you caring until the very end.

From the very moment that young Danny is asked to reach in Brenda Blethyn's womb to untangle the umbilical chord wrapped around her birthing-baby's neck, we enter the unusual world of passion,fate and destiny. Forward around twenty years and Danny (a very funny and appealing Jude Law) is destined by fate to meet the baby he helped deliver and has vowed to marry.What puts this rom-com above many others is the EXCEPTIONAL ensemble cast of actors that understand their parts and act them to the hilt.In fact, other than Gretchen Mol's character Anna, the baby grown up, who's character is overly responsible and self-deprived of passion ( therefore rightly not so animated) the rest of the cast, Brenda Blethyn, Jennifer Tilly,Jane Adams, Jeremy Piven, and ESPECIALLY Martha Plimpton and Vince Laresca are comedically quite effective in saving this film from becoming ordinary.Yes, this film is formulaic,but think about it-formulas are time tested and true-that's why they work.

The plot reads like a reject from the ""high-concept"" comedy assembly line at 1980's Touchstone Pictures: young boy delivers baby, falls instantly in love with infant girl, then returns more than 20 years later to fulfill a ""destiny"" he had apparently forgotten: marrying her. You'll never guess what happens next ... Oh, all right! Of course you will. Aside from how truly dreadful it is, this film lacks any surprises.No character in the film betrays a whit of common sense as they are folded, spindled and mutilated in service of a storyline so painstakingly-contrived as to be embarrassing. Director Charlie Peters fails to correct any of the flaws in his own screenplay (according to IMDb, it took this hack another 11 years to land any sort of gig at all), shoehorning a generally impressive cast into trite situations unleavened by any worthy dialogue. The pacing is wrong -- Helen Keller could have done a better job editing this mess. Especially depressing is the lack of chemistry between any of the leads. This movie fails at all levels -- and is made all the worse by a garish production design that leaves the physically-attractive cast looking as bad as they ever have on film.Even Jude Law's one shirtless scene is brief, and shot in near-darkness for crying out loud!

157747,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,0792898974,Only-A-Child,"[4, 4]","""Music From Another Room"" is certainly recommended viewing, for what it is and despite what it fails to be. Writer Charlie Peters constructed as good a screenplay as you will ever find in the ""straight"" romantic genre. Unfortunately there is a failure in the execution as director Charlie Peters drops the ball in his casting decisions and in his efforts to extract the necessary performances from the two leads, Jude Law (Danny) and Gretchen Mol (Anna). And solid efforts from the supporting cast are not enough to make up for these key deficiencies.Peters' story was inspired by Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina"", and it is Danny's fate, shortly after arriving in town, to stumble across Grace Swan (Brenda Blethyn) and her family who he has not seen since he was five. ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way"". At age five he had assisted his physician father in delivering daughter Anna (like the book the family's three daughters are named Anna, Karen, and Nina). Seconds after Anna's birth Danny had vowed that they would one day be married. But there is no indication in the screenplay that the grown-up Danny has come to town for this purpose, on the contrary he came to be with another woman who he has fallen in love with but who dumps him and moves away shortly after his arrival.Peters should get credit for a great title, as ""Music From Another Room"" is a metaphor Danny uses to illustrate how he has felt in the past when he was in love. The idea being that love is like listening to a favorite song playing in the distance and coming back on the same beat of the song when it has been periodically drowned out by closer noises.He should also get credit for the originality of the two-headed coin flip sequence; which sets up the film's resolution according to the flip of a regular coin. The irony being the characters ability to flip this device of randomness/destiny into an exercise of their free will.Although not a comedy, the film is has a lot of charm and some funny moments. Even with its flaws it is better than average but this does leave you regretting that Peters did not recognize his limitations as a director and bring in someone who could have better execute the ambitious vision of his screenplay.The problem is that the elements which make the screenplay so good, its originality and its many quirky qualities, require exceptional performances from the lead characters who must non-verbally convey a whole lot of character motivation as well as several moments of profound revelation. For ""actors"" up to this behavioral challenge (and for a skilled director), the roles offer a wonderful ""acting for the camera"" opportunity. For Law, Mol, and Peters it is way too much to ask and the result is strained and unconvincing. Which means that the mixes of sadness and joy, fate and free will, ignorance and revelation never achieve the dimensionality they should have. The failure to fill in the blanks with behavioral information combined with elements that were deleted in the editing process introduces an element of incoherence that ultimate undermines an excellent story.Although Law has frequently demonstrated a lot of ability, he has stated that he regrets doing ""Music From Another Room"" and that he let himself be talked into the part.

He transcends the whole (somewhat wierd) story and tries to give life and personality to a character that in the script has none (save an alarming love-addiction to a girl who as far as I can figure ain't outstanding enough to warrant it).The second best thing was the unexpected romance between Jennifer Tilly (blind sister of the hero's love interest) and her dance partner from the night club. I liked it better than the main couple's stumble into bliss.This movie is a lumpy package. Few of the promises it makes to the audience throughout the story seem to pan out. It had no consistent ""feel"" to get into. The family and personal problems felt perverse and sad, not funny at all. The constant sexual jokes and innuendo were annoying and at times the dialogue felt very artificial, as though nobody could act naturally saying what they were given to say. Danny's (Jude Law's) devotion to Anna was confusing, as it seemed to be founded in... nothing. Why is she so outstanding? I found her flippant and shallow.For more well-rounded, satisfying romantic comedies, I would suggest ""Return to Me"", ""Maid in Manhattan"", ""Ever After"", ""While You Were Sleeping"", ""The Wedding Planner"", or even Disney's new ""Parent Trap"".",2,Disjointed and Sad...

His father then moves him to England and the story picks up 25 years later.We next see an absolutely gorgeous Danny (Jude Law) on his return to the United States where he must find employment and a place to live. Fate jumps in and provides him with both in the form of a rented room above a bakery and a job delivering baked goods. Fate again steps in and creates a bicycle accident that knocks him off his bike and into the arms of none other than Anna Swan(Gretchen Mol), the baby he helped deliver 25 years before. Without a doubt, Danny is obviously smitten even before he realizes who she is. No big surprise we discover the girl of his dreams is engaged to someone else.The delightfully disfunctional Swan family brings comic relief to what could have easily been just another run-of-the-mill romance story. Grace (Brenda Blethyn), the family matriarch is a light hearted, rather etherial sort of mother. You adore her character for a variety of reasons, most importantly because she genuinely loves Danny. Nina (Jennifer Tilly) the blind sister who is sheltered beyond belief until Danny encourages her to spread her wings a little and teaches her that there is life outside of her sheltered existence. Billy (Jeremy Piven) the brother that cheats on his insane wife, Irene (Jane Adams) (these characters are obviously included solely to garner a few comedic moments and succeed well). Karen (Martha Plimpton) the gay sister who has a great line or two but basically is a rather dispensable character.There is one character that bears a special mention, Jesus (pronounced in the english form rather than the spanish way) played by Vincent Laresca. He plays the eventual love interest of Nina. Girls will fall for his dorky touching portrayal of a man in love with a blind woman.There is a lot of predictability with this movie but it is still worth watching. I would be remiss if I didn't point out there is one of the most delightful death scenes ever filmed, it is also one of the funniest scenes in the movie.

Maybe I enjoyed it a little more than I should have because I ran into it on cable and had absolutely no prior expectations whatsoever.The predicament of the movie -- a young man (Jude) meets a woman whose birth he had assisted in over a couple of decades ago. This woman (Gretchen) is the only ""normal"" character in her otherwise quirky family. The interplay between the family members and other supporting cast is quite amusing and original, and there is some dialogue dealing with love and death that is truly moving (e.g., pay attention to what the ""Music from another room"" stands for, absolutely lyrical).This is not your average uber-classy fare with geewhiz cinematography or hard-hitting emotional melodrama. It is a simple story of relentless love and devotion, with a pace that you could wrap a cushy evening around. But one thing this confirms yet again is that, man, can Jude Law act! He is confident, credible and very honest with his role as a lovelorn delivery boy (one which he was apparently the first to proclaim in a UK entertainment channel interview that wasn't ""his type"").Finally, a surprise that you'll surely not be prepared for comes from Jennifer Tilly (you'll remember her from innumerable side roles, e.g., Jim Carrey's client in Liar Liar) who is simply wonderful in her potrayal of a blind woman's whims and insecurities. Easily her best role to date!If you aren't expecting a When Harry Met Sally, I'd recommend this movie in a blink.",5,"A sweet, nutty comedy you can wrap a cushy evening around",1049932800,"04 10, 2003",2003,1882,"['first', 'conclusion', 'am', 'going', 'have', 'make', 'someone', 'who', 'movie', ""n't"", 'fabulously', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'crass', 'taste', 'humour', 'most', 'likely', 'Spy', 'who', 'shagged', 'genre.Make', 'mistake', 'MFAR', 'light', 'nutty', 'often', 'comical', 'occasionally', 'even', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'case', 'almost', 'scene', 'sister', 'Karen', 'played', 'wonderful', 'timing', 'Plimpton', 'Maybe', 'enjoyed', 'little', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'ran', 'cable', 'had', 'absolutely', 'prior', 'expectations', 'whatsoever.The', 'predicament', 'movie', 'young', 'man', 'Jude', 'woman', 'birth', 'had', 'assisted', 'couple', 'decades', 'ago', 'woman', 'Gretchen', 'only', 'normal', 'character', 'otherwise', 'quirky', 'family', 'interplay', 'family', 'members', 'other', 'supporting', 'cast', 'quite', 'amusing', 'original', 'dialogue', 'dealing', 'love', 'death', 'truly', 'moving', 'e.g.', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'Music', 'room', 'stands', 'absolutely', 'lyrical', '.This', 'not', 'average', 'uber-classy', 'fare', 'geewhiz', 'cinematography', 'hard-hitting', 'emotional', 'melodrama', 'simple', 'story', 'relentless', 'love', 'devotion', 'pace', 'could', 'wrap', 'cushy', 'evening', 'around', 'one', 'thing', 'yet', 'again', 'man', 'can', 'Jude', 'Law', 'act', 'confident', 'credible', 'very', 'honest', 'role', 'lovelorn', 'delivery', 'boy', 'one', 'was', 'apparently', 'first', 'proclaim', 'UK', 'entertainment', 'channel', 'interview', 'was', ""n't"", 'type', '.Finally', 'surprise', ""'ll"", 'surely', 'not', 'be', 'prepared', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'innumerable', 'side', 'roles', 'e.g.', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'client', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'who', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'potrayal', 'blind', 'woman', 'whims', 'insecurities', 'Easily', 'best', 'role', 'date', 'are', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'blink']",N/A

I am not so sure I would have cast her for the part, but, she is likeable enough. Her character needs someone to excite her and take her away and give her a sense of freedom which is what Danny (Law) does for her, or at least she eventually finds out.
