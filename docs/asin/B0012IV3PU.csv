Salzenstein ""Style Editor""","[2, 2]","Although the concept behind History's Life After People - what would/will happen to earth if/when the human race cease's to inhabit it - may not be new, the presentation, production value, special effects, and impact of this brilliantly produced documentary put it in a league of its own. ""Greenies,"" young people, and even those who aren't normally fans of documentaries or ""nature shows"" will thoroughly enjoy this documentary.Life After People theorizes about the fate of the earth when humans no longer ""control"" it; how it would (re)turn to a more natural state ""if"" we went extinct. Which ecosystems would take over? What animals, plants and insects would survive? What remnants of the industrialized world would remain, and for how long? Based on both evidence of the demise of past civilizations and computer simulated models, this documentary explores the hypothetical (although sadly, all too likely) process our planet may embark on should/when we're no longer here.Visually stunning and insightful, this special is especially thought provoking for young viewers, who also happen to hold the fate of the world in their hands. Taking on subjects as ""small"" as household pets, as complex as New York skyscrapers, and as large - philosophically and scientifically speaking - as the possibility of evolution happening all over again, Life After People is an outstanding, informative, and extremely entertaining documentary. Thanks to the engaging subject matter and excellent production, it's sure to live on as one of the History Channel's best presentations.Special FeaturesAs a television documentary, Bonus Features are not part of the production process.

It's a look at what would become of the world if we were to up and disappear one day.It's divided into sections: one day after people, one week after, one month after, one year, ten years, 25 years, 100 years, 1000 years, and out to 50,000 years IIRC. So it starts with our pets having to find a way out of the house, then vermin going through the food on pantry and store shelves, to what happens to houses after decades of neglect. Eventually you see some of humanity's most durable structures collapse: the Eiffel Tower, the Space Needle, and other things come down--though they're replayed a few too many times.Of course you have to suspend disbelief a little and assume that all of humanity has disappeared one day for no apparent reason. But I don't think that's a problem for this film, since it's not suggesting that's a realistic scenario, just a ""Hey, what if..."" kind of idea. The movie is remarkable for consulting heavily with scientists and engineers to get the details right.So it's ironic that my one real criticism is that it gets the collapse of the Golden Gate Bridge WRONG! After thousands of years, the cables holding up the bridge weaken and snap, and then the support towers sag toward the middle. That's backward--as with any suspension bridge, the cables are anchored at either end, pulling outward with tons of force. If the cables were to snap, the support towers would be yanked *away* from the center. (See astronomer Phil Plait's review of The Core at badastronomy.com for details.) It's puzzling that they did the Golden Gate wrong, considering the effort they put into getting engineering details right in this film. But other movies have done the same, probably because it seems intuitive.

(Maybe I still haven't gotten over the rotting bodies in ""The Stand"".) That wasn't the story I was interested in hearing when I purchased Life After People.Life After People starts out promisingly enough and certainly manages to engage viewers emotionally by playing on our concern over the fate of house pets. And, for the most part, I found the entire show interesting. I particularly liked the visit to the abandoned town near Chernobyl.Ultimately, though, I felt too much time was spent talking about corrosion and how human made structures would deteriorate and collapse. It seemed to get repetitive. I would have liked to have seen a lot more focus on plant, animal and insect life and how particular species might - or might not - adjust in their altered habitat. I also would have liked more focus on what part climate changes brought about by the absence of humans would play in flora and fauna behavioral changes, survival and evolution.Still, I found this a good introduction to the subject and I particularly think it would appeal to younger viewers, spurring their curiosity. I hope I'll find more information on plants and animals, etc. - and a little less on corrosion - in some of the other materials I purchased.",3,Fascinating Subject,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,1656,"['Imagining', 'planet', 'people', 'no', 'longer', 'exist', 'fascinating', ""'m"", 'happy', 'see', 'other', 'books', 'DVDs', 'dealing', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'assortment', 'Life', 'People', 'was', 'first', 'DVD', 'watched', ""'ve"", 'not', 'yet', 'read', 'books.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'creators', 'chose', 'just', 'do', 'away', 'people', 'rather', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'speculating', 'how', 'met', 'demise', 'even', 'where', 'bodies', 'disappeared', 'Maybe', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'over', 'rotting', 'bodies', 'Stand', 'was', ""n't"", 'story', 'was', 'interested', 'hearing', 'when', 'purchased', 'Life', 'People.Life', 'People', 'out', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'certainly', 'engage', 'viewers', 'emotionally', 'playing', 'concern', 'fate', 'house', 'pets', 'most', 'part', 'found', 'entire', 'show', 'interesting', 'particularly', 'liked', 'visit', 'abandoned', 'town', 'Chernobyl.Ultimately', 'felt', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'talking', 'corrosion', 'how', 'human', 'made', 'structures', 'would', 'deteriorate', 'collapse', 'seemed', 'get', 'repetitive', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'more', 'focus', 'plant', 'animal', 'insect', 'life', 'how', 'particular', 'species', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'adjust', 'altered', 'habitat', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'focus', 'what', 'part', 'climate', 'changes', 'brought', 'about', 'absence', 'humans', 'would', 'play', 'flora', 'fauna', 'behavioral', 'changes', 'survival', 'evolution.Still', 'found', 'good', 'introduction', 'subject', 'particularly', 'think', 'would', 'appeal', 'younger', 'viewers', 'spurring', 'curiosity', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'find', 'more', 'information', 'plants', 'animals', 'etc', 'little', 'less', 'corrosion', 'other', 'materials', 'purchased']",Life After People

The beginning of the movie was hard for me to watch (the discussion of the fate of household pets, for example) but this movie is thought-out and fascinating as it is informative. The CG graphics are worth renting or buying the movie for.It could have used more though, since it was only 1.5 hours and it would be better as a series, there was so much to be talked about. This documentary mainly focused on the USA, with a bare mention of what happens in other countries. For example, the mold and decay and plant growth that would be prevalent in warmer parts of the world wouldn't be a concern in say, Northern Canada or Russia where much of the year is spent in ice.And what of species that have been practically pushed to the brink of extinction? It was talked about a bit in the film (wolves, for example) but they just talked about wolves, and not anything about animals in other countries that have been poached for trophies and medicine (like in China)There was no note made of the waste in landfills in the movie, or all the things that humans leave behind that don't decay so easily like jewelry, plastic items, treated metal items (so it won't rust), electronic equipment, what have you.Also, what of all the man-made chemicals to be found everywhere, especially in factories where you have chemicals in huge vats? It's be interesting to have seen how they projected the effect of these chemicals once their holding vats or containers rot or fall apart, or what happens to all the drugs and pills to be found in homes, stories, and pharmacies.

How or why this would happen is not covered: the subject of this DVD is the succession of events following such a disappearance, as things arranged and constructed by humans fail over time (out to 100,000 years after said disappearance).Pros:- The show is very dramatic and maintains interest.- Graphical effects demonstrate likely outcomes, including spectacular sequences of large-scale collapses.- Experts showcased on the show seem authoritative and provide relevant insight.Cons (these are all minor, in my opinion):- At times, this program seems a little too dramatic.  The narration sometimes comes from the perspective that nature is hostile, and surprise is expressed at the notion that ""the planet and life on it would go on without us"".- One of the featured experts was a little too philosophical.  Though I liked hearing most of what he had to say, he was given too much air time.- Given the extremely low cost of computer-generated special effects today, visual quality should have been better.This is not a ""con"", but my guess is that the depicted timeline is somewhat accelerated.In short, this production poses a very interesting hypothetical question, explores the likely answer with experts and presents the whole package very well.Flaws are relatively small.If one is interested in this subject, note that a similar program has been developed, ""National Geographic: Aftermath - Population Zero"" (2008).",5,4.5 stars: Very good with minor flaws,1220486400,"09 4, 2008",2008,1519,"['program', 'likely', 'outcome', 'sudden', 'disappearance', 'humans', 'Earth', 'How', 'why', 'would', 'happen', 'not', 'covered', 'subject', 'DVD', 'succession', 'events', 'following', 'such', 'disappearance', 'things', 'arranged', 'constructed', 'humans', 'fail', 'time', '100,000', 'years', 'said', 'disappearance', '.Pros', 'show', 'very', 'dramatic', 'interest.-', 'Graphical', 'effects', 'demonstrate', 'likely', 'outcomes', 'including', 'spectacular', 'sequences', 'large-scale', 'collapses.-', 'Experts', 'showcased', 'show', 'seem', 'authoritative', 'provide', 'relevant', 'insight.Cons', 'are', 'minor', 'opinion', 'times', 'program', 'little', 'too', 'dramatic', 'narration', 'sometimes', 'perspective', 'nature', 'hostile', 'surprise', 'expressed', 'notion', 'planet', 'life', 'would', 'go', '.-', 'One', 'featured', 'experts', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'philosophical', 'liked', 'hearing', 'most', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'was', 'given', 'too', 'much', 'air', 'time.-', 'Given', 'extremely', 'low', 'cost', 'computer-generated', 'special', 'effects', 'today', 'visual', 'quality', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better.This', 'not', 'con', 'guess', 'depicted', 'timeline', 'somewhat', 'accelerated.In', 'short', 'production', 'very', 'interesting', 'hypothetical', 'question', 'likely', 'answer', 'experts', 'whole', 'package', 'very', 'well.Flaws', 'are', 'relatively', 'small.If', 'one', 'interested', 'subject', 'note', 'similar', 'program', 'been', 'developed', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Aftermath', 'Population', 'Zero', '2008']",Life After People

1137149,ASJAKT8DJIAC5,B0012IV3PU,"YetAnotherITGuy ""Chris""","[4, 4]","This review is regarding the Blu-ray version of this video. Nice, crisp video rendering (not great, but definitely worth the extra $$$ for the Blu-ray version). Audio is average, nothing spectacular, but then it's a documentary. Disc plays fine in my Samsung BDP-1500. Special features are interesting. Will probably buy more History Channel features on Blu-Ray as they become available.As far as the feature and subject matter - absolutely, utterly amazing.Personal anecdote. When I was around 12 years old, I lived in a neighborhood located next to a large cotton field. One summer a road building crew came out and constructed a  mile stretch of concrete road way off in the farthest reaches of the cotton field, for no apparent reason (it was advance work for a delayed urban expansion which did not to take place for another 15 years).That stretch of brand new road, sitting out in the middle of the cotton field, decaying, grass and weeds growing up between the cracks, frogs, rabbits and other critters making it their home, just fascinated me. Sometimes, I would ride out to it on my bike and just sit, listen to the silence and the sounds of Nature as it slowly consumed the concrete, took back what It owned. Walking along the stretch of road, I would imagine I was the last person on Earth. That was the summer I read ""Earth Abides"" by George R. Stewart, a book that left a huge impression on me.I've been a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction ever since.UPDATE: Problem. On loading, the disc hang my Blu-Ray player about 50% of the time. Suspect defective mastering of the disc boot sector for the first batch of these discs (maybe why it reverted to ""unavailable"" status shortly after I bought it?). May have to exchange for a new disc. Otherwise, my comments above are unchanged.",5,"Great Blu-ray disc, fascinating subject",1244937600,"06 14, 2009",2009,1789,"['review', 'regarding', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'video', 'Nice', 'crisp', 'video', 'rendering', 'not', 'great', 'definitely', 'extra', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'Audio', 'average', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'then', 'documentary', 'Disc', 'fine', 'Samsung', 'BDP-1500', 'Special', 'features', 'are', 'interesting', 'Will', 'probably', 'buy', 'more', 'History', 'Channel', 'features', 'Blu-Ray', 'become', 'available.As', 'far', 'feature', 'subject', 'matter', 'absolutely', 'utterly', 'amazing.Personal', 'anecdote', 'When', 'was', 'around', '12', 'years', 'old', 'lived', 'neighborhood', 'located', 'next', 'large', 'cotton', 'field', 'One', 'summer', 'road', 'building', 'crew', 'came', 'out', 'constructed', 'mile', 'stretch', 'concrete', 'road', 'way', 'farthest', 'reaches', 'cotton', 'field', 'apparent', 'reason', 'was', 'advance', 'work', 'delayed', 'urban', 'expansion', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'place', '15', 'years', '.That', 'stretch', 'brand', 'new', 'road', 'sitting', 'out', 'middle', 'cotton', 'field', 'decaying', 'grass', 'weeds', 'growing', 'up', 'cracks', 'frogs', 'rabbits', 'other', 'critters', 'making', 'home', 'just', 'fascinated', 'Sometimes', 'would', 'ride', 'bike', 'just', 'sit', 'listen', 'silence', 'sounds', 'Nature', 'slowly', 'consumed', 'concrete', 'took', 'back', 'what', 'owned', 'Walking', 'stretch', 'road', 'would', 'imagine', 'was', 'last', 'person', 'Earth', 'was', 'summer', 'read', 'Earth', 'Abides', 'George', 'R.', 'Stewart', 'book', 'left', 'huge', 'impression', 'me.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'post-apocalyptic', 'fiction', 'ever', 'Problem', 'loading', 'disc', 'hang', 'Blu-Ray', 'player', '50', '%', 'time', 'Suspect', 'defective', 'mastering', 'disc', 'boot', 'sector', 'first', 'batch', 'discs', 'maybe', 'why', 'reverted', 'unavailable', 'status', 'shortly', 'bought', 'May', 'have', 'exchange', 'new', 'disc', 'Otherwise', 'comments', 'are', 'unchanged']",Life After People
