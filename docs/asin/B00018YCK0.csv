As she realized he took her experiences as valid, she told a sad tale of vampires and isolation. Eventually, this woman who'd been abused as a girl made her way back to earth. Patients like her had taught Jung that the fact of a person's madness did not in any way invalidate the richness and authenticity of their personal mythology.It would be easy to dismiss--to ""shrink""--Maggie Cogan's inner world. Having been homeless in Central Park, she clearly displays the classic symptoms of schizophrenia. She is one of thousands and thousands of women in the U.S. left without adequate health care or even the means to support themselves. As her story gradually emerges, the trained watcher wonders whether her schizophrenic predisposition would have manifested so floridly had she not been subjected to the events described in this film. As a result, she believes she is Hera, wife of Zeus, or in Roman terms, Juno, the wife of Jupiter. She wears a radio strapped to her head so she can be ""on the airwaves"" tuned in to what's happening. (She finds New York gridlock amusing and avoids it.) The filmmaker decided to listen in and, at one point, not only investigate her past, but contact social services personnel to get her some help. Unfortunately, they showed up with sledgehammers and knocked down her shed. No squatters allowed, even in a New York winter.When I show this film to graduate students I suggest that they hold it on at least two levels simultaneously--the needless tragedy of this homeless woman's life, and the mythological dimension that surrounds it like an aura--without reducing one to the other and thereby falling into either the shrinkage of reductionism or the romanticization of mental illness. Maggie Cogan is a person with a story to tell, a survivor, an inspiration, and a face of reality behind all the political jingoism to justify spending billions on weapons while Americans starve. She is also a parable. In ancient times storytellers and listeners knew the world remained in balance so long as Jupiter and Juno remained in relations of mutual empowerment. But today, as the plutocracy consumes the planet surface (""plutocracy"" from Pluto, god of death and wealth), Jupiter has lost his throne to President Mars, the family in all its versions is on the brink of bankruptcy, and Hera is no longer the Queen of Heaven, maternal image of feminine authority. She lives on relief in New Jersey, where she looks after her puppies, goes without medication, and listens in on the pulse of the times without losing her dignity or her sense of the ironic.",5,"the real face of ""family values"".....",1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,2669,"['C.', 'G.', 'Jung', 'once', 'had', 'patient', 'who', 'believed', 'lived', 'moon', 'So', 'Jung', 'met', 'there', 'realized', 'took', 'experiences', 'valid', 'told', 'sad', 'tale', 'vampires', 'isolation', 'Eventually', 'woman', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'abused', 'girl', 'made', 'way', 'back', 'earth', 'Patients', 'had', 'taught', 'Jung', 'fact', 'person', 'madness', 'did', 'not', 'way', 'invalidate', 'richness', 'authenticity', 'personal', 'mythology.It', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'shrink', 'Maggie', 'Cogan', 'inner', 'world', 'Having', 'been', 'homeless', 'Central', 'Park', 'clearly', 'classic', 'symptoms', 'schizophrenia', 'one', 'thousands', 'thousands', 'women', 'U.S.', 'left', 'adequate', 'health', 'care', 'even', 'means', 'support', 'story', 'gradually', 'trained', 'watcher', 'wonders', 'schizophrenic', 'predisposition', 'would', 'have', 'manifested', 'so', 'floridly', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'subjected', 'events', 'described', 'film', 'result', 'Hera', 'wife', 'Zeus', 'Roman', 'terms', 'Juno', 'wife', 'Jupiter', 'radio', 'strapped', 'head', 'can', 'be', 'airwaves', 'tuned', 'what', 'happening', 'New', 'York', 'gridlock', 'amusing', 'avoids', 'filmmaker', 'decided', 'listen', 'one', 'point', 'not', 'only', 'investigate', 'past', 'contact', 'social', 'services', 'personnel', 'get', 'help', 'Unfortunately', 'showed', 'up', 'sledgehammers', 'knocked', 'down', 'shed', 'squatters', 'allowed', 'even', 'New', 'York', 'winter.When', 'show', 'film', 'graduate', 'students', 'suggest', 'hold', 'least', 'two', 'levels', 'simultaneously', 'needless', 'tragedy', 'homeless', 'woman', 'life', 'mythological', 'dimension', 'aura', 'reducing', 'one', 'other', 'thereby', 'falling', 'shrinkage', 'reductionism', 'romanticization', 'mental', 'illness', 'Maggie', 'Cogan', 'person', 'story', 'tell', 'survivor', 'inspiration', 'face', 'reality', 'political', 'jingoism', 'justify', 'spending', 'billions', 'weapons', 'Americans', 'starve', 'also', 'parable', 'ancient', 'times', 'storytellers', 'listeners', 'knew', 'world', 'remained', 'balance', 'so', 'long', 'Jupiter', 'Juno', 'remained', 'relations', 'mutual', 'empowerment', 'today', 'plutocracy', 'planet', 'surface', 'plutocracy', 'Pluto', 'god', 'death', 'wealth', 'Jupiter', 'lost', 'throne', 'President', 'Mars', 'family', 'versions', 'brink', 'bankruptcy', 'Hera', 'no', 'longer', 'Queen', 'Heaven', 'maternal', 'image', 'feminine', 'authority', 'relief', 'New', 'Jersey', 'where', 'puppies', 'medication', 'pulse', 'times', 'losing', 'dignity', 'sense', 'ironic']",N/A

Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[11, 11]","This documentary introduces us to Maggie a lady of middle years living in Manhattan's Central Park with a pack of stray dogs she has made in to a family of sorts.  The filmmaker, Michel Negroponte, met Maggie by chance in the park and was entranced by her beguiling personality and cryptic statements that seem to show both madness and wisdom.  Maggie is a mysterious character and Negroponte is able to solve some of the mystery of her earlier life through a bit of research that surprisingly uncovers  tapes of different appearances she made on national television as a young woman in her career as  one of the first female horse carriage driver/tour guides in New York City.  Maggie has affluent friends (including the film's producer Negroponte) who help her with her life but there is no fairy tale  ending to the story.

Her prediction on the date and time about a specific incident (not a spoiler) was amazing. ESP and the Universal Mind are concepts many Spiritual people espouse as gifts that we all have, it's just whether we choose to tap into this ability. We ALL hear voices, from the child who hears inwardly, 'You're stupid&#34; to the the middle-aged woman who hears, &#34; You're now worthless in this society, because only youth and beauty are valued in women in American society.&#34;. Maggie's voices aren't acceptable to the general public, and too far out there, so she is schizophrenic. Maybe not by LA standards, but she's coped the best way possible for her. This is a mental health label we would all gladly put on her as we would avoid her and her menagerie upon encountering her. Maggie's good-hearted nature, ready smile, and authentic loving will open the hearts of many viewers. This is not a weird or depressing documentary. She wants peace for the world, and that is the sign of a big-hearted soul who cares for others....this isn't the definition of &#34;crazy&#34; in any language. Kudos also to the people who befriended her with yoga, massages, animal care, and government aid. Mixing fact and fantasy, she even brought forward a wonderful friend from the Upper East Side....showing what loving and a good attitude can accomplish..the improbable if not the impossible.
