Somewhere along the way, these movies billing themselves as comedies have failed miserably to live up to the title of ' barely amusing '. I'm not some film snob who can only chuckle at a Woody Allen movie..my faves are anything with Jim Carrey, or anything Farrelly Brother/Kevin Smith/Austin Power-related. These American Pie movies, though..these things have to be the most overrated piles of garbage the studio machine has unleashed in the last few years. OK, the first one i found mildly amusing at times, but sure not the gut-busting, laugh-riot it was billed to be. Apparently there are millions out there who are easily amused, because they made a sequel..and man, what an awful movie. Tired, uninspired..just a bad, unfunny movie. Of course it goes on to make like almost 200 million or something at the box office. For an american movie-going public that makes Rush Hour 2 one of the biggest hits of the year though, this comes as no surprise.

543777,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CY6C,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","The one detractor I have with the `American Pie' films (or at least the first two) is that they don't ware well.  I say `the first two' mainly because the third feature film (and the subsequent `straight to video' sequels) is atrocious even the first time.  The first two films are enjoyable in their own right the first go around, but neither film has true `repeat power'.  In other words; when you watch it the second time you struggle to remember why you raved it the first.  They just don't age with grace.  The laughs aren't as consistent the second go around, and while some say that this sequel is a peg above the first, I disagree.  The laughs seem somewhat regurgitated (the superglue scene was a ridiculous attempt to capitalize off of the first films iconic apple pie scene) and the premise seems even more ridiculous.  The first film had some edge to it, and certainly an ample amount of uniqueness.  A second, third and fourth viewing of the original show its flaws, but this second film doesn't need so many chances; you can spot the flaws on the initial viewing.  Still, Jason Biggs had a knack for this kind of humor, and he doesn't disappoint, and Eugene Levy will always be `Jim's Dad' and for that I am grateful, even if his character becomes somewhat one-note over time.  It has a certain degree of fun here, so don't begrudge it before you see it, but once is more than enough.",3,One night stand...,1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,1398,"['one', 'detractor', 'have', 'American', 'Pie', 'films', 'least', 'first', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'ware', 'well', 'say', 'first', 'two', 'mainly', 'third', 'feature', 'film', 'subsequent', 'straight', 'video', 'sequels', 'atrocious', 'even', 'first', 'time', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'right', 'first', 'go', 'around', 'film', 'true', 'repeat', 'power', 'other', 'words', 'when', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'struggle', 'remember', 'why', 'raved', 'first', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'age', 'grace', 'laughs', 'are', ""n't"", 'consistent', 'second', 'go', 'around', 'say', 'sequel', 'peg', 'first', 'disagree', 'laughs', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'regurgitated', 'superglue', 'scene', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'attempt', 'capitalize', 'first', 'films', 'iconic', 'apple', 'pie', 'scene', 'premise', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'edge', 'certainly', 'ample', 'amount', 'uniqueness', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'viewing', 'original', 'show', 'flaws', 'second', 'film', ""n't"", 'need', 'so', 'many', 'chances', 'can', 'spot', 'flaws', 'initial', 'viewing', 'Still', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'had', 'knack', 'kind', 'humor', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Jim', 'Dad', 'am', 'grateful', 'even', 'character', 'somewhat', 'one-note', 'time', 'certain', 'degree', 'fun', 'here', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'begrudge', 'see', 'once', 'more', 'enough']",American Pie 2 Unrated Edition  VHS
543778,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00003CY6C,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[8, 9]","Don't you hate sequels that are just clones of the original movies with ten times the action and one one hundredth the plot?  Well, then you'll be happy to hear that American Pie 2 isn't one of those movies.  The plot, which doesn't play a significant part in either, is different: the four friends, back from their first year of college, have decided to rent a lake house on Lake Michigan and throw the biggest and best party that the town has ever seen.  Also, Jim (Jason Biggs) is eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) the hot Czech girl that he almost scored with the previous  year, and he is taking lessons on how to please girls from Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), his prom date.  During these sequences, we, the audience, begin to realize that Jim and Michelle are meant to be, and part of the fun is watching how oblivious they are to it.  But the best part is, the entire cast is back, although, there is a shift in importance of characters.  The four main guys don't change much, but Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) does get a little weirder.  Stifler (Seann William Scott) becomes a bigger character in this one, though.  He still isn't part of the group, but he is in more scenes and he's in on the deal this time.  The girls are a whole different story.  In the first movie, they were given significant screentime and they appeared in scenes by themselves.  Now, the only girl who you can say has &quot;significant&quot; screentime is Michelle, the girl (of the five main ones) who had the smallest role in the first one.  Also, there is only one big scene with only girls, and it is with Vicky and Jessica (Tara Reid and Natasha Lyonne).  Michelle is by herself for a few moments at the end, but then Jim arrives to whisk her away.  All in all, this movie is hilarious, just as good, if not better than, the first.  As I said, not too much story, but (1) there is more plot in this movie than in most other teen movies combined, and (2) that isn't what fans are looking for in an American Pie movie.

543783,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00003CY6C,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","Everyone knows how sequels go. You take what you had in the first, and you do more of it. This is why I feel that this film is a lot crasser than the wonderful original. While the first film was able to balance the raunch and crudeness with an intelligent script that had heart and some truly hilarious moments, this film doesn't achieve the success of the first. But it is still truly enjoyable. What I like best about this movie, is how it continues the lives of these characters in a normal, realistic manner. The first film showcased the relationships and friendships of young teens in high school, and this one develops the story as they are now older and in college. Once your in college, things change. Some people go down seperate paths, and the bond isn't as strong as it used to be. The film shows this as our friends in the film try to stay together and to have a great summer. The plot(if there is one), is fairly simple and formulaic. Our returning faves, Jim(Jason Biggs), Stifler(Sean William Scott), Finch(Eddie Kaye Thomas), Oz(Chris Klein), and Kevin(Thomas Ian Nicholas), have finished their first year in college. They decide to get together and have one big summer blow out by staying at a beach house and having fun. The females from the first film join in on the fun. While there, the boys decide to paint houses to earn some extra cash. The females, with the exception of band geek Michelle(the hysterical Alyson Hannigan), seem to take the backseat in this film to the guys. Shannon Elizabeth has a bigger part, but poor Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, and Natash Lyonne seem to just be there to hang around. The development of the relationship between Jim and Michelle is wonderful. One of the bigger highlights of the film. The problem with the film is that it doesn't seem as well structured as the first. It is very competently performed, but the heart of the first film just isn't there. There are some nice scenes with Jim and his dad(the brilliant Eugene Levy), but it doesn't hit the mark like in the original. The raunch factor is there in all it's glory, but it's not as easy to take in this one as it was in the first. It's pushing it too hard. The film is definitley funny, but the spirit just doesn't seem to be there. The upcoming third film sounds as if it will be a lot better. I sure hope so. The best performance in the entire film is from Hannigan as Michelle. She has proven to be a brilliant, emmy worthy actress on &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot;, and her performance is just as solid here. She brings a lot more layers and depth to Michelle here. She is phenomenal and wonderful to watch. The look on her face when she gets in her car after helping Jim get Nadia is priceless. That said, everyone does a good job. They make their characters fun to watch and can really make the audience feel like they are, in certain ways, them and their friends. AP2 is not nuclear science, and while many people are quick to judge and condemn the film, maybe they should just relax a bit and let the young people on screen have fun, and the ones in the audience too.

You see, back in 2001 a movie focusing around a bunch of college students partying, getting drunk and hooking up with chicks just seemed pretty pointless and a waste of tape to me. It's not a strong enough idea for a storyline.  I still honestly believe that, however the storytelling here is at *least* better than most of the college comedies being passed off as top of the line humor these days.Oh and it's definitely true that the entirety of American Pie 2 is filled to the brim with typical immature college humor. Some of it definitely feels like total fluff to me.However at least it has certain hilarious scenes to save the film from utter disaster such as a trumpet solo during a band performance, a super glue ""tough time"" in the bedroom involving one of the guys, a certain somewhat overlong walkie talkie moment that the entire town happens to overhear, and countless little jokes here and there that barely bring my overall rating to a 4 out of 5. Just barely.On the flipside, at least the girls are really attractive (especially that one redhead and the girl with a European accent- oh man to be a teenager again!) and the soundtrack is pretty good. Most of the songs used in the movie reflect the time period in which they were created and released, so the memories are nice.Just a barely passable style of comedy though.

And it has retained and amplified one important aspect of the original, a somewhat cornball sentimentality that offers a nice counterbalance to the gross sight gags and pervasive atmosphere of salaciousness.Jason Biggs continues to throw himself into the most embarrassing of situations with admirable gusto, and the movie hinges on his ability to play Jim's most humiliating shenanigans with an odd but appealing, dogged dignity...even when wearing only his drawers.  His comic timing is even better than last time, and the movie's best moments come of his straight-faced delivery.  And in this sequel you can see how Alyson Hannigan managed to walk off with the most famous line in the original:  Given much more weight in American Pie 2, Hannigan is a delight, playing Michelle's offbeat geekiness but hidden warmth to perfection.  And her deadpan delivery (the &quot;trumpet&quot; line is bound to become another classic) is beautiful as always.  Shannon Elizabeth is surprisingly lacklustre, and Tara Reid is still stuck with the most boring character of the bunch, but otherwise the rest of the supporting cast (Seann William Scott is especially good, reprising uber-jock Stifler) is great, and the sight and verbal gags come faster and tighter than in the original, with the benefit of familiar characters.  The famous central gag (won't give it away) had me belly-laughing for a solid minute, something I haven't done since the first time I saw Clerks.No, it's not cerebral, nor is it an unprecedented classic.

As usual, Kevin comes up with a plan! Rent a house on the beach and have a summer of fun, sex and hilarity!All of the guys have their respective lives now. Oz has his girl (Mena Suvari), Finch still laments about his one (Stiffler's mom), Kevin wishes he still had his girl (Tara Reid), Stiffler wants to kill Finch and of course, Jim still thinks about Nadia, the one that slipt away. In this one, Jim gets his second chance because out of the blue, Nadia calls him up amd tells him that she'll be coming back to see him. Jim , worried that he won't be able to satisfy her needs, goes back to his one (at band camp) Michelle.

Ok lets go.The cast are now in college, Jim is gettng himself a piece when his dad comes to pick him and surprises Jim by coming in while his son is having sex. Oh what a embarassing moment, then her parents come in and discover the scene. Oh Jim, first it was the pie, now this.Now the crew are going on summer break, Heather is going to Europe for studies, which leaves Oz alone, which is ok since they have a good and steady relationship. Oh then comes Stifner, who leads Oz to one of the classes to see what kind of underwear a certain girl is wearing, it is roses to be more exact. So then the crew comes back home, then like usual, Stifer throws a party with high school seniors mixed with college freshmen, then two girls go to Jim and they say this and I quote: ""Hey I remember you."" Jim then looks at them and says ""Yeah you do?"" ""You were that guy who blew his load all over the internet,"" they start laughing. ""Oh Nadia dont go."" mocking Jim.Then Stifler gets a girl drunk, and leads her to the back porch for a drink of champange. Then a guy who has to take a piss really badly knocks over one of the flower pots knocking out the girl who was going to spill champange down his face, then the guys starts peeing, and Stifer saids this: ""Oh how did you get it so warm?"" referring to the champange. Then Stifner finds out the truth: he got peed on. The cops shut down the party, and now there is nowhere for them to party, so Kevin talks to his older brother, and tells him about this summer house, so they pack up with Jim, Oz, Kevin, and Finch going, but there is one problem, they cannot afford the rent for the summer, so they have to bring 'the almighty Stifner'.So they get the house, and start working for a painting company, and Stifner see's their two clients which they give each other a peck on the cheek, now being Stifer, he thinks that they are LESBIANS! So he sneaks into their room, with Jim and Finch trying to get him out of there, but Kevin says that they are coming back, so they try to distract the girls, but no luck, but in the process Stifner finds a sex toy, and he goes around the house with it in the air. Now they have to hide, and the fun begins. You have to see the movie to understand what I am talking about. Now as they get set up for the party, Nadia is heading to the house to get it on with Jim since last time they coulnt because Jim had a 'little accident', guys know what I am talking about on this one.Finch is also getting prepared for Stifer's mom, since she told her son that she is coming over, but does not know when. Then the party comes forward. Nadia comes, and Jim finds a new love; Michelle, and he tries to take a couple of lessons from Michelle to make good love to Nadia, but in the process he falls in love with Michelle, and the party continues. All of the guys except for Finch gets laid, but here comes the shock of the end: when they are heading home, a sliver 2002 Mersades pulls up in the driveway, and Finch knows who it is. So Stifner's mom ask him this: ""you wanna get it on?"" Finch replies. ""You better clear your schedule."" He tells the guys he will be back in a couple of days, and Stifner sees the car, asking the guys who was it. ""Oh they were looking for the lake."" Stifner then points to the lake , and he nows knows what happens.

543816,A2Q8GDXZVUQX7N,B00003CY6C,"""essndee""","[3, 11]","Ever wonder why women and gays seem to be treated less equally? Well you can thank movies like this one that help contribute to that problem.This movie helps the overrated view of lesbians even more. Lesbians are normal people like everyone else, but it seems like society has programmed men to think it is one of the definitions of ""sexy."" Lesbians have not become just normal people, but this huge sex symbol. Is this what the gay community wants, for lesbians to be continously exploited? They promote just that in this movie, with the stereotypical view of lesbians today... This not only hurts normal, every-day lesbian women, but also heterosexual women, because this type of stereotpical view helps strengthen sexism in today's culture.And, ironically (or maybe not) gay men are treated as the exact opposite. The tone in the movie suggests that while the lesbians are extremely sexy and perfectly acceptable, that the idea of two gay men is disgusting and used for humor only...This movie is EXACTLY how gay society is portrayed by the media. Lesbians sexy and acceptable, gay men disgusting and funny. I KNOW that the whole movie isn't about gay and lesbians, I'm just pointing out a certain aspect of the movie that annoys me to death because the same concept is shoved in my face every day by the media.Unlike the first ""American Pie,"" this movie did not have an oune of intelligence. I am definitely not a fan of the original, but the levels they sunk to in this movie to outdo the first were [weak], sick, and equaled out to a lot less enjoyable and fun to watch as the original movie. Like someone else said, this was ""re-heated pie."" This was definitely not an improvement. The only enjoyable cast member was Eugene Levy, and as much as I'm a fan of his, it's hard to be in a movie like this.To close things up, I am not trying to be overanalytical (although I might be too late), but I am just pointing out the obvious. Why does the media portray lesbian women as sexy? Because lesbians make them money. Why does the media portray gay men as disgusting and funny? Because gay jokes sell.

543818,AI345DWOQT367,B00003CY6C,faith star,"[1, 1]","(Slight spoiler of previous movie)The surprise hit American Pie had some surprising comic substance that appealed to some who had expected the premise to imply an impalatable dose of &quot;raunchiness&quot;. But the first movie did focus heavily on light comedy. Its most uncomfortable thing for me was the fact that the jock among the main characters was the one to apparently win true love in the course of the movie. In light of serious questions about adulation of jocks (in, for example, the wake of the Columbine School disaster) I thought any movie should give the issue some thought, not just casually invoking stock outcomes. The jock as winner syndrome therein, was it without conscious planning? Or was it supposed to be realism? If the latter, who really wants or needs realism in a thoroughly irreverent light comedy? But the sequel deos take different turns, possibly explaining why there might have been a hint of realism in the original - a possible explanantion, though I'm not saying a completely adequate resolution of my one main problem with the original. Anyhow, this sequel follows the continuing adventures of the main characters we met in the first film. Although comedy still abounds, there's some serious drama here, even some taking on of a more somber tone. As some of the characters mature, there's a bit of nostalgia about how their wildly adventurous high school days are over. Their outcomes are not always what the audience expected or necessarily hoped for. Some other characters may seem to mature little if at all. Those two contrasting situations may indeed be a dose of realism. And that as well as the jock as winner syndrome early on in the first movie may form part of an overall perspective of realism when we see the two movies collectively. Was that all planned in advance? I'm not sure how that generally works. Are sequels generally an afterthought or part of a complete story palnned from the start?",4,"SEQUEL RIVALS ORIGINAL, TAKES SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT TURNS",1014076800,"02 19, 2002",2002,1947,"['Slight', 'spoiler', 'previous', 'movie', 'surprise', 'hit', 'American', 'Pie', 'had', 'surprising', 'comic', 'substance', 'appealed', 'who', 'had', 'expected', 'premise', 'imply', 'impalatable', 'dose', 'quot', 'raunchiness', 'quot', 'first', 'movie', 'did', 'focus', 'heavily', 'light', 'comedy', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'thing', 'was', 'fact', 'jock', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'one', 'apparently', 'win', 'true', 'love', 'course', 'movie', 'light', 'serious', 'questions', 'adulation', 'jocks', 'example', 'wake', 'Columbine', 'School', 'disaster', 'thought', 'movie', 'should', 'give', 'issue', 'thought', 'not', 'just', 'casually', 'invoking', 'stock', 'outcomes', 'jock', 'winner', 'syndrome', 'therein', 'was', 'conscious', 'planning', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'realism', 'latter', 'who', 'really', 'realism', 'thoroughly', 'irreverent', 'light', 'comedy', 'sequel', 'deos', 'take', 'different', 'turns', 'possibly', 'explaining', 'why', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'hint', 'realism', 'original', 'possible', 'explanantion', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'completely', 'adequate', 'resolution', 'one', 'main', 'problem', 'original', 'Anyhow', 'sequel', 'continuing', 'adventures', 'main', 'characters', 'met', 'first', 'film', 'comedy', 'still', 'serious', 'drama', 'here', 'even', 'taking', 'more', 'somber', 'tone', 'characters', 'mature', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'how', 'wildly', 'adventurous', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'are', 'outcomes', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'what', 'audience', 'expected', 'necessarily', 'hoped', 'other', 'characters', 'may', 'seem', 'mature', 'little', 'two', 'contrasting', 'situations', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'dose', 'realism', 'as', 'well', 'jock', 'winner', 'syndrome', 'early', 'first', 'movie', 'may', 'form', 'part', 'overall', 'perspective', 'realism', 'when', 'see', 'two', 'movies', 'collectively', 'Was', 'planned', 'advance', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'generally', 'Are', 'generally', 'afterthought', 'part', 'complete', 'story', 'palnned', 'start']",American Pie 2 Unrated Edition  VHS
543819,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CY6C,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 3]","As sequels go, this isn't too bad.  Most sequels underperform the original by a good margin, but this one falls off only slightly.  In many places the comedy in APII is better than the first.  However, it is mostly just raunchier.  What is missing here is any attempt at creating a plot.  The first film had a clear and consistent plot that revolved around ""The Pact"".  It also had a candor about it that was very representative of high school life with all its braggadocio, bravado and hidden insecurities.  With the exception of Jim (Jason Biggs) who retains his performance anxiety from the last film, all the innocence is gone from this film and with it much of the charm.  Most of the cast members are back, but the cohesiveness is missing along with some of the synergy.That doesn't mean it is without laughs because outrageous sex skits will always be funny (as long as they don't get too gross, like Scary Movie) and this film has them in abundance.  Some miss but most hit.  You could see the super glue bit coming a mile away, but it is still hilarious.  The phone sex scene isn't.  Still, the best scenes in the film are not the raunchy ones, but the sex lessons given to Jim by his friendly band geek Michelle (Alyson Hannigan).Jason Biggs leads the ensemble with another terrific performance of a guy obsessed with performance.  Biggs is the actor with the most nuance in the cast, capable of both outrageous and subtle humor.  Shannon Elizabeth is sidelined as the Nadia, being more of an object than an active participant in this film.  Chris Klein is also marginalized with very few scenes worth mentioning.  Seann William Scott is back as Stifler, more outrageous than ever.  This time he goes too far making the character's crudeness and untamed libido so obnoxious that it stops being funny.  Eddie Kaye Thomas isn't given much to work with the way Finch is written this time, being more bizarre than comical.  Once again, Alyson Hannigan steals the show as Michelle, the queen of band camp.  Her wide eyed facial expressions are priceless and her comic timing is impeccable.  Hannigan and Biggs have fantastic chemistry and play off one another so well that they could have been a vaudeville act.  Eugene Levy is marvelous as Jim's well meaning but hopelessly square dad.This film meanders a great deal and misses the freshness of the first film, but is still packed with plenty of fun.  I rated it a 7/10.

By now everyone already knows the plot of AP2 and either loves it or hates it so I won't get into describing what the movie is about. I'm going to review the dvd (Collectors Edition, Full Screen) in itself. I have to say that the extras on it are fantastic. I especially loved the commentary by Mena Suvari (Heather), Jason Biggs (Jim) and Thoman Ian Nicholas (Kevin). This is the first time I've ever heard commentary in a movie that I've enjoyed. It's great to hear the actors comment and tease eachother on their work in such a fun, light hearted way. I kept laughing throughout the whole thing. However, the commentary by Eddie Kaye Thomas (Finch) was extremely boring and pointless. It felt like watching a movie in the theater with someone making random comments every 20 minutes. In other words, his commentary was mostly looooong lapses of silence and then he'd say something random. Maybe the problem was that Eddie did the commentary by himself, maybe if they'd put him with another actor it would've been more lively. It would've been nice if they'd put him with Alyson Hannigan (Michelle) and Sean William Scott (Stifler).The outakes were hilarious and making of the second pie was even funnier, you can see how much fun the cast had making this together.

543852,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00003CY6C,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","I am using ""American Pie"" in my Popular Culture class so I figured I should check out the sequel.  You have to admit that this is not a sequel that tries to produce a carbon copy of the original.  The first time around there was the ""pact,"" and for round two there is just an attempt to have a good time during the summer.The entire cast is back for ""American Pie 2"" but there are two major differences in terms of the character dynamics.  First, this is really ""American Pie 2B,"" with the emphasis on the boys rather than a balance between the sexes.  Mena Suvari's Heather is almost down to a cameo and there is only one decent girl talk between Vicky (Tara Reid) and Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) this time around (on the ""Rule of 3"").  However, there is much more of Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) and everybody knows that there is no way I am going to complain about that.  Second, in ""American Pie"" the focus was clearly on the characters of Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas).  But this time around the biggest plot threads have to deal with Jim, Stifler (Seann William Scott), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas).  That shift along is guaranteed to change the dynamic of the film, because you are never going to be able to take Stifler seriously, or Finch, for that matter.The reason I am using ""American Pie"" in class is because I have not made my mind about that film: it starts off proclaiming itself to be a standard film where a bunch of high school boys try to get laid.  But then along the way it seems the boys learn about love, or at least there is more to sex than getting laid.  But then again, they do get laid.  The same principle is at work in this film at well as there are ""serious issues.""  Can Kevin and Vicky just be friends in the aftermath of their breakup?  Can Oz and Heather survive her being in Spain for most of the summer?  Can Jason make Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) happy when she shows up to see him at the end of the summer?  Can we make it through all the extras on this DVD?However, the big case study comes in what fans picked as the #1 ""American Pie"" scene ever, the ""lesbian scene,"" where the boys want to see a couple of young women they think are lesbians.  The girls are willing to perform, provided the boys do a little performing themselves.  Again, we are back to the quandary: is this a critique of such adolescent libido or an exploitation of the same?  Or is it just standard Hollywood marketing?

543857,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CY6C,Matthew Horner,"[2, 2]","My mind has played a trick on me, not that that's a newsworthy event. Halfway through American Pie 2, I thought to myself how much better and funnier the original was. I just looked up my review, and I didn't much like it, for much the same reason I didn't care for the sequel. In both movies, the characters have such a clinical view of sex. The way I see it, if you have neither romance nor passion, the whole subject of sex is pretty tame, not to mention unimportant. Still, this second helping does bring back the original's main asset, which is a bright, talented and likable young cast. They are fun to watch and give the material their best shots. The reason it's not as good is simply that the jokes overall are not very inspired. Since this is a comedy, that's a big problem.Jim [Jason Biggs] and his pals have just finished their first year of college. Now a summer, with its promise of booze, babes and parties, is ahead. One of Jim's friends decides the gang should rent a beach house on Lake Michigan, thus saving them from the horror of spending the summer with their parents. Nadia [Shannon Elizabeth], the exchange student Jim had some very embarrassing moments with live on the Net in the first movie, is traveling in Europe for the summer. She tells him she'll come to see him at the end of summer. Terrified that he will once again not perform up to her expectations, Jim seeks the help of Michelle [Alyson Hannigan], who is now a counselor at a nearby band camp. Michelle, as loony and out there as ever, agrees to 'train' him. Meanwhile, Stifler [Sean Scott Williams] remains a lovable macho idiot, Oz [Chris Klein] is still going with Jessica [Natasha Lyonne], Kevin [Thomas Ian Nichol] is now unhappily single, and Paul [Eddie Kaye Thomas] pines for Stifler's Mom.While Universal Studios was able to reassemble the original cast, which was perhaps contractually obligated to do so, it could not get the writer and the director back. This may explain why the first one is more sophisticated, funnier and and less flawed than the sequel.Jason Biggs is a good actor with a gift for physical comedy. Alyson Hannigan's character, Michelle, is forced to morph into a more normal girl. This change dilutes her part, but Hannigan is still often wickedly funny. Sean William Scott has a field day as Stifler, who has a much larger role this time. In an uncredited role, Jennifer Coolidge returns as Stifler's Mom. Coolidge is one of the best comedic actresses around, and it's too bad she is in just one scene. The cast really is good; in fact, it's more talent than the movie deserves. It gives it an illusion of quality.There are a few scenes that work really well. I admit to laughing out loud during them. Others come off as awkward and underwritten. I found the movie to be rather provincial in its attitude towards sex, but I may simply be too jaded, since the movie was as big a hit overseas as it was here. On the other hand, the term 'provincial' is not one that applies solely to America.The 'controversial' scene in the original involved Jim and a warm apple pie. This time around it is about Jim's close encounter with a tube of super glue. I mention this because, when you see the movie, I want you to answer this question: How on earth did Jim get his shoes back on?",2,One half baked Pie,1015718400,"03 10, 2002",2002,3294,"['mind', 'played', 'trick', 'not', 'newsworthy', 'event', 'Halfway', 'American', 'Pie', '2', 'thought', 'myself', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'funnier', 'original', 'was', 'just', 'looked', 'up', 'review', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'much', 'same', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'sequel', 'movies', 'characters', 'have', 'clinical', 'view', 'sex', 'way', 'see', 'have', 'romance', 'passion', 'whole', 'subject', 'sex', 'pretty', 'tame', 'not', 'mention', 'unimportant', 'Still', 'second', 'helping', 'bring', 'back', 'original', 'main', 'asset', 'bright', 'talented', 'likable', 'young', 'cast', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'give', 'material', 'best', 'shots', 'reason', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'simply', 'jokes', 'overall', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'inspired', 'comedy', 'big', 'problem.Jim', '[', 'Jason', 'Biggs', ']', 'pals', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'first', 'year', 'college', 'Now', 'summer', 'promise', 'booze', 'babes', 'parties', 'ahead', 'One', 'Jim', 'friends', 'gang', 'should', 'rent', 'beach', 'house', 'Lake', 'Michigan', 'thus', 'saving', 'horror', 'spending', 'summer', 'parents', 'Nadia', '[', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', ']', 'exchange', 'student', 'Jim', 'had', 'very', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'live', 'Net', 'first', 'movie', 'traveling', 'Europe', 'summer', ""'ll"", 'come', 'see', 'end', 'summer', 'Terrified', 'will', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'perform', 'up', 'expectations', 'Jim', 'help', 'Michelle', '[', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', ']', 'who', 'now', 'counselor', 'nearby', 'band', 'camp', 'Michelle', 'loony', 'out', 'there', 'ever', ""'train"", 'Meanwhile', 'Stifler', '[', 'Sean', 'Scott', 'Williams', ']', 'lovable', 'macho', 'idiot', 'Oz', '[', 'Chris', 'Klein', ']', 'still', 'going', 'Jessica', '[', 'Natasha', 'Lyonne', ']', 'Kevin', '[', 'Thomas', 'Ian', 'Nichol', ']', 'now', 'unhappily', 'single', 'Paul', '[', 'Eddie', 'Kaye', 'Thomas', ']', 'pines', 'Stifler', 'Mom.While', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'was', 'able', 'reassemble', 'original', 'cast', 'was', 'perhaps', 'contractually', 'obligated', 'do', 'so', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'writer', 'director', 'back', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'first', 'one', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'funnier', 'less', 'flawed', 'sequel.Jason', 'Biggs', 'good', 'actor', 'gift', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'character', 'Michelle', 'forced', 'morph', 'more', 'normal', 'girl', 'change', 'part', 'Hannigan', 'still', 'often', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'field', 'day', 'Stifler', 'who', 'much', 'larger', 'role', 'time', 'uncredited', 'role', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'Stifler', 'Mom', 'Coolidge', 'one', 'best', 'comedic', 'actresses', 'too', 'bad', 'just', 'one', 'scene', 'cast', 'really', 'good', 'fact', 'more', 'talent', 'movie', 'illusion', 'quality.There', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'admit', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'Others', 'come', 'off', 'awkward', 'underwritten', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'rather', 'provincial', 'attitude', 'towards', 'sex', 'may', 'simply', 'be', 'too', 'jaded', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'big', 'hit', 'overseas', 'was', 'here', 'other', 'hand', 'term', ""'provincial"", 'not', 'one', 'solely', 'America.The', ""'controversial"", 'scene', 'original', 'involved', 'Jim', 'warm', 'apple', 'pie', 'time', 'Jim', 'close', 'encounter', 'tube', 'super', 'glue', 'mention', 'because', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'want', 'answer', 'question', 'How', 'earth', 'did', 'Jim', 'get', 'shoes', 'back']",American Pie 2 Unrated Edition  VHS

After a party at Stiflers, that almost exactly resembles the one from the first movie, the gang decides to take their adventures to a beach house and spend the summer there.  While they are trying to find jobs and throw beach parties, the boys have some of their own dilemmas at hand they need to deal with. Jim finds out that Nadia is back in the states after she got booted from them after their internet debacle. Jim has only had sex one and half times since that incident though. So to try and get himself prepared for Nadia, he takes on the aid of Michelle, the band geek that rocked his world from a year ago. As she begins to teach him the ways of sexual behavior, they themselves begin to realize that maybe they are more than they think they are to one another. Kevin, after splitting from Vicky, has to get over his feeling for her once she shows up at the house to have fun. Because for her, they are just friends, which is why she now has a new boy in her life. Oz has to deal with a long distance relationship with Heather since she went away for the summer. It doesn't help though that his best friend Stifler is constantly trying to get him to have sex with any girl within a 3 yard radius of them. Speaking of Stifler, he's still coping with the fact that Finch had sex with his mom last year. And Finch is having withdrawals from not being with Stifler's mom.For the longest time I thought that part 1 was the better of these 2. I seriously think I've been wrong this whole time. After watching these back to back last night, I can whole heartedly tell you I laughed a lot more with part 2. The jokes are better and even raunchier. The embarrassments Jim go through are hilarious (good god the super glue scene). The girls are hotter. And Stifle maybe just a tad over the top, but is still a lot better in part 2. When he grabs that dildo and shakes it while running through that house, I could not stop laughing. And when he says he forgot where he found it cause of all the excitement from when he found it was just hilarious. The lesbian scene was just laugh out loud funny also.In the end, I would definitely own this. Just remember though, if you aren't into raunchy and crude comedy, just stay away.P.S. - There is no way any single straight man would have walked out of that light house without having done something with Nadia.

Kevin, Oz, Jim and Finch have returned from their first year of college to rent a beach house for the summer and continue their smutty adventures as only horny teenage boys can.  Having successfully left their virginity in the dust by the time they finished high school, they wish to continue their newfound ""stud status"" by hosting parties at their parentless, ruleless rental property.  Because they can't afford to rent over the summer with just the four of them, they include the irrepresible, incorigable Stiffler.  It makes for some more mishaps, continued adventures in smut and testosterone soaked humor.Still, this was a good time.  Oz and Kevin's relationships faded into the background, Finch is pinning away for Stiffler's Mom and is planning a tantric encounter if and when he sees her again, and once again Jim was the focus.  Jim, the hapless, lovable loser, is floundering through their situation while the others seem happy and successful.  He is going to be reunited with Nadia, the nubile exchange student whose awkward encounter was accidentally broadcast on the Internet in the last movie (This antic is repeated with Kevin and Stiffler's walkie talkies.).  She had forgotten about it as she still wants to bed Jim, but he discovers that he doesn't want to beautiful Nadia but the band camp geek, Michelle, who hung him out to dry in the first movie.I give this 4 stars because of the humor, otherwise the story lines were a little too silly and too unbelievable.  I have a hard time believing that any guy in Jim's position would pass up a chance with a girl like Nadia, whether or not he would go back to Michelle.  Kevin seems ernest enough in his value of Tara Reid as a friend even though they are no longer romaniticly linked, but I would have liked to have seen the relationship progress over the years, even weeks.  Oz?  Well, Oz was a happy every guy, but as he continued his realtionship with his girlfriend abroad, there was no drama or challenge.It was happy sequel, you'll enjoy it.",4,Another piece of pie,1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,2101,"['Once', 'again', 'boys', 'American', 'Pie', 'have', 'reunited', 'create', 'raunchy', 'good', 'time', 'Kevin', 'Oz', 'Jim', 'Finch', 'have', 'returned', 'first', 'year', 'college', 'rent', 'beach', 'house', 'summer', 'continue', 'smutty', 'adventures', 'only', 'horny', 'teenage', 'boys', 'can', 'Having', 'successfully', 'left', 'virginity', 'dust', 'time', 'finished', 'high', 'school', 'wish', 'continue', 'newfound', 'stud', 'status', 'hosting', 'parties', 'parentless', 'ruleless', 'rental', 'property', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'rent', 'summer', 'just', 'four', 'include', 'irrepresible', 'incorigable', 'Stiffler', 'more', 'mishaps', 'continued', 'adventures', 'smut', 'testosterone', 'soaked', 'humor.Still', 'was', 'good', 'time', 'Oz', 'Kevin', 'relationships', 'faded', 'background', 'Finch', 'pinning', 'away', 'Stiffler', 'Mom', 'planning', 'tantric', 'encounter', 'when', 'again', 'once', 'again', 'Jim', 'was', 'focus', 'Jim', 'hapless', 'lovable', 'loser', 'floundering', 'situation', 'others', 'seem', 'happy', 'successful', 'going', 'be', 'reunited', 'Nadia', 'nubile', 'exchange', 'student', 'awkward', 'encounter', 'was', 'accidentally', 'broadcast', 'Internet', 'last', 'movie', 'antic', 'repeated', 'Kevin', 'Stiffler', 'walkie', 'talkies.', 'had', 'forgotten', 'about', 'still', 'bed', 'Jim', ""n't"", 'want', 'beautiful', 'Nadia', 'band', 'camp', 'geek', 'Michelle', 'who', 'hung', 'out', 'dry', 'first', 'movie.I', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'humor', 'otherwise', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'little', 'too', 'silly', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'guy', 'Jim', 'position', 'would', 'pass', 'up', 'chance', 'girl', 'Nadia', 'not', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'Michelle', 'Kevin', 'ernest', 'enough', 'value', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'friend', 'even', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'romaniticly', 'linked', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'relationship', 'progress', 'years', 'even', 'weeks', 'Oz', 'Well', 'Oz', 'was', 'happy', 'guy', 'continued', 'realtionship', 'girlfriend', 'abroad', 'was', 'drama', 'challenge.It', 'was', 'happy', 'sequel', ""'ll"", 'enjoy']",American Pie 2 Unrated Edition  VHS

Back home for summer from their first year as college students, the gang is out for more ways to get some action - obviously college taught them nothing. Each member is still attached to the previous episode of high school charm and humor. So much so, that they keep bringing up past events as if they would be funny again. I remember thinking as I was watching the film, those were funny moments, but why are they not funny here? I realized they were not funny because they were memories. As the moral of the story later sets in, that one cannot live in the past and cling to memories, so should have the writers considered this when writing the script. I would like to further note that I got the distinct impression that all of the actors held a sense of self-consciousness in thier acting. Most notably Michelle, the band camp girl. It was as if Michelle and the rest of the crew were going through some sort of thespian puberty; highly aware of their popularity and the comradery that they are supposed to have with each other. This did not ring through for me like the first one did. I sensed in the first one they were all true friends, as if they grew up with each other. While in this film, they were getting the job done to get paid and go home. My expectations to laugh uncontrolably may have set my ability to be highly critical of the film, and I really wanted to laugh, however, I felt that all of the humor missed the mark by a few inches. The situational humor versus the ""memorial"" humor is obviously the key to its success, as the first American Pie demonstrated each moment to be as funny as the next.

I liked how they were pushing the Stifler character to the limits of homophobia all in the name of seeing some lesbian action. The things some guys will do, huh? :) Anyways, it's a nice little teen movie that again is reminiscent with the old 80's teen sex movies updated to the 21st century. While I know the story centers around the four main guys, it was kinda disappointing not to see more screen time from Mena and the rest of the girls. But, Alysson Hannigan definitely got more character time and was a welcome sight. I always thought she has a nice range of skills in the dramatic and comedic roles.Anyways, as for the rest of the dvd, we get a  full complement of extras from the standard bios, alternate languages, subtitles to the special ""Making of..,"" deleted scenes, outtakes, collection of catch phrases and favorite scenes, and one music video.

543881,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00003CY6C,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","Remakes are rarely as good as the originals, and this movie is not exception... There are many, many scenes that just left me completely cold, and that I had to suffer through with considerable patience.  I liked the first film, but this one wasn't anywhere near up to the level of the first.Many of the best scenes featured either or both Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy.  Like in the first film, Levy completely steals every scene in which he appears, as the father who is way, way too open-minded for the good of the relationship with his son.  Although this remake is not nearly as funny as the original, the scene in which Jason Biggs puts super glue to ill use is totally hysterical.One of the reasons the sequel isn't as funny is the fact that the relationships between the various guys and their gals aren't developed as much as in the original.  The key element in these films is the irony between the intended sybaritism of the four (or five, if you count Stifler), and their basic monogamy.  But the impact of the monogamy comes from the tightness of the relationship with each guy's significant other, and apart from Biggs and Alyson Hannigan's characters, none of them are really developed in this one.Overall, not a terrible film.  And fans of the original won't feel too terribly disappointed by the first.  In fact, if the more scatological and lascivious moments of the original were the parts that someone most enjoyed, one might like the sequel as much or more.

Because, on a purely filmmaking level, it is not as good a movie as the first. It has a weaker (almost non-existent) story, almost completely ignores all of the female characters from the first film, and has very little purpose other than to entertain. On the other hand, somehow it manages to be exponentially more fun than the first film, which, although I loved it, was weighed down by its moral that sex is not as good as its cracked up to be, unless it's with someone you love. It is more fun than the first film, more hilariously, gutbustingly funny, and is also one of the few sequels that (1) should not be missed and (2) is a logical extension of the first film. What do I mean by that? This sequel wisely picks up jokes and story threads from the first movie, and reworks and twists them in ways that make them even funnier. One would never guess watching the first film how some throwaway lines and jokes pay off in this second film. More than most sequels, this is a truly a companion movie to the first.Another great idea is how the small, yet extremely popular character of Michelle (the band-camp girl) from the first movie, is expanded into a much fuller, more poignant character in this, the second film.I will guarantee you that, if you have an open mind for humor, and enjoyed the first film, you will have a great time with this movie.

543895,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00003CY6C,Westley,"[5, 6]","American Pie 2 is very funny and filled with raunchy humor, although it's arguably not as funny as the original. You really do need to see AP1 to fully appreciate the humor of AP2 as many of the jokes are continuations of jokes from AP1. The main plot concerns what happens when the boys finish their first year of college. They return home and start doing the same things they did before, including going to high school parties. But then they realize that things change, and they all grow and change in funny and believable ways (well, almost all of them grow up).Unfortunately, two of the most likeable characters/actors from the first film (Chris Klein and Mena Suvari) have small parts and few laughs. Instead, Michelle (one time at band camp...) and Stifler are given larger roles and more laughs.The DVD is packed with goodies. Casting tapes from AP1 of many of the stars are included and you can definitely see why they got the parts. Outakes and deleted scenes are also included and add much humor. In addition, the 10 funniest scenes (as voted by internet audiences) from AP1 and AP2 are counted down. Several commentary tracks are also included, with several of the stars taking part. These tracks are interesting, but utimately a bit tedious....the stars are quiet for long periods of time and at one point, one of the stars quips, ""We really need a director or something here to talk about the technical stuff.""

543897,A1Q15TP2FXYYMF,B00003CY6C,"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo""","[1, 1]","It usually a given fact that sequels are never as good as the original film and unfortunately with American Pie 2 this is very much the case.That's not necessarily because the film is particularly worse than the first but some of the stock jokes just don't have the impact as when seeing them for the first time round, and when comparisons can be directly drawn with some of the jokes of the original the second time they are presented that can only come across slightly watered down.That said it is still an extremely funny and sweet film and one of the best features of this sequel is that it features, to a man, all the main characters from the first film, indeed it doesn't just stop there but also manages to cram in a few of the minor character for good measure also. In many senses it hasn't changed from the original at all, it still has the sweetest nature of all the young-college-brat-frat-gross-out films of its era and still conjures up the most embarrassing situations for its stars. The jokes still make you laugh out loud and the romantic interludes still make you go ""arrrrrhh""Again another nice touch from the film makers is that they haven't tried to contrive any of the new situations by changing the character traits from the first film. So Oz and Kevin for example aren't changed back into girl hunting lads again, but both struggle with sorting out more permanent relationships. What the film makers have also done though is bring some of the background characters to the fore greatly and let them run away with some of the spotlight. Stifler is a prime example of this. Great also to see bother Jessica (who is again criminally under used) and The Shermanator back for roles.",5,Treat Yourself To A Second Slice Of That Beautiful Pie,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,1699,"['usually', 'given', 'fact', 'sequels', 'are', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'American', 'Pie', '2', 'very', 'much', 'case.That', 'not', 'necessarily', 'film', 'particularly', 'worse', 'first', 'stock', 'jokes', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'impact', 'when', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'round', 'when', 'comparisons', 'can', 'be', 'directly', 'drawn', 'jokes', 'original', 'second', 'time', 'are', 'presented', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'slightly', 'watered', 'down.That', 'said', 'still', 'extremely', 'funny', 'sweet', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'features', 'sequel', 'man', 'main', 'characters', 'first', 'film', 'indeed', ""n't"", 'just', 'stop', 'there', 'also', 'cram', 'few', 'minor', 'character', 'good', 'measure', 'also', 'many', 'senses', ""n't"", 'changed', 'original', 'still', 'sweetest', 'nature', 'young-college-brat-frat-gross-out', 'films', 'era', 'still', 'up', 'most', 'embarrassing', 'situations', 'stars', 'jokes', 'still', 'make', 'loud', 'romantic', 'interludes', 'still', 'make', 'go', 'arrrrrhh', 'Again', 'nice', 'touch', 'film', 'makers', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'contrive', 'new', 'situations', 'changing', 'character', 'traits', 'first', 'film', 'Oz', 'Kevin', 'example', 'are', ""n't"", 'changed', 'back', 'girl', 'hunting', 'lads', 'again', 'struggle', 'sorting', 'out', 'more', 'permanent', 'relationships', 'What', 'film', 'makers', 'have', 'also', 'done', 'though', 'bring', 'background', 'characters', 'fore', 'greatly', 'let', 'run', 'away', 'spotlight', 'Stifler', 'prime', 'example', 'Great', 'also', 'see', 'bother', 'Jessica', 'who', 'again', 'criminally', 'used', 'Shermanator', 'back', 'roles']",American Pie 2 Unrated Edition  VHS
