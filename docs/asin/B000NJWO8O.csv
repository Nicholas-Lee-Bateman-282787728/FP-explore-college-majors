It is much better than the Wheelchair Workout from the same series, but still did not keep my interest.  I have been an avid exerciser for many years -- step aerobics, competitive swimming, hiking, Zumba -- so I did not have very high expectations for this video.  I just wanted something to keep me moving while sitting.  This workout does do that, but it has some major flaws:--The music is bad:  electronic, canned, Muzak-like--- The music is TOO LOUD and covers up the instructor's voice at times---The instructor's choreography is predictable and repetitive:  very boring!I kept using the DVD in spite of these problems because I thought there weren't any other DVDs that would be better.  However, I just found Jodi Stolove's Chair Dancing DVDS a couple of weeks ago and these are MUCH better in terms of chroeography.  The musi on Jodi's videos is also bad, but at least her movements are interesting and fun.  I'd recommend ckipping this ""Salsa"" workout and opting for Jodi Stolove.",3,"Cute Instructor, but Ho-Hum Workout",1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,1090,"['bought', 'DVD', 'use', '16-plus', 'weeks', 'wheelchair', 'confinement', 'breaking', 'foot', 'much', 'better', 'Wheelchair', 'same', 'series', 'still', 'did', 'not', 'keep', 'interest', 'have', 'been', 'avid', 'exerciser', 'many', 'years', 'step', 'aerobics', 'competitive', 'swimming', 'hiking', 'Zumba', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'video', 'just', 'wanted', 'something', 'keep', 'moving', 'sitting', 'workout', 'do', 'major', 'flaws', 'music', 'bad', 'electronic', 'canned', 'Muzak-like', 'music', 'TOO', 'LOUD', 'up', 'instructor', 'voice', 'times', '-The', 'instructor', 'choreography', 'predictable', 'repetitive', 'very', 'boring', 'kept', 'using', 'DVD', 'spite', 'problems', 'thought', 'were', ""n't"", 'other', 'DVDs', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'However', 'just', 'found', 'Jodi', 'Stolove', 'Chair', 'Dancing', 'DVDS', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'are', 'MUCH', 'better', 'terms', 'chroeography', 'musi', 'Jodi', 'videos', 'also', 'bad', 'least', 'movements', 'are', 'interesting', 'fun', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'ckipping', 'Salsa', 'workout', 'opting', 'Jodi', 'Stolove']",Chair Aerobics for Everyone - Chair Salsa

I bought this video when I learned about chair exercises could help me. I was pleasantly surprised by this workout. First of all David Stamps is cute as a button and motivational. Also I have lost ten pounds since I started doing this one and watching what I eat in moderation. Not bad in two weeks time. I still have a lot to lose but I know with chair exercises and dieting I can reach my goal God willing. Great workout.

I bought some of the chair exercise DVDs to have an additional way to get my heart rate up which doesn't use equipment.  It's a change of pace for me from my usual exercises.  Am I great at following his lead?  Nope, but I hope that I will get better.  Do I care?  No.  There is just something that feels so accepting and nonjudgmental about the man who leads the exercise and the music is so fun that I just laugh at myself when I flub up and just keep trying.
