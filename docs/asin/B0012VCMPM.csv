1139518,A10RGJ0NVVGODV,B0012VCMPM,Ron Wise,"[69, 70]","First of all, if you are a TV Western fan, this is one heck of a set. There's 300 episodes from a wide variety of Fifties and Sixties TV shows, and the picture and sound quality for the most part are not too bad.Having said that, I recommend that anyone buying this set takes the time to check all 24 discs to see if they load properly or play properly in your DVD player. Since these are double-sided discs, that means checking 48 sides!I've sent two sets of this title back to Amazon already. In the first set, the following discs would not load: 5 (B), 15 (B), 19 (B) & 20 (B).  In the second set, the following discs would not load: 5 (B), 15 (A), 19 (B) & 20 (B). At that point, I gave up and did not check the rest of the discs in the second set. Both sets were returned and Amazon was professional about it.So, if you are like me, and want to see all the 300 episodes that you paid for, check each disc in your DVD player when your set arrives. If you can get a set that is defect-free, then you have gotten yourself a real low-priced treasure trove of great TV viewing.",3,"If you order this set, be sure to do your own quality control check",1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,1077,"['First', 'all', 'are', 'TV', 'Western', 'fan', 'one', 'heck', 'set', '300', 'episodes', 'wide', 'variety', 'Fifties', 'Sixties', 'TV', 'shows', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'bad.Having', 'said', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'buying', 'set', 'time', 'check', '24', 'discs', 'see', 'load', 'properly', 'play', 'properly', 'DVD', 'player', 'are', 'double-sided', 'discs', 'checking', '48', 'sides', ""'ve"", 'sent', 'two', 'sets', 'title', 'back', 'Amazon', 'already', 'first', 'set', 'following', 'discs', 'would', 'not', 'load', '5', 'B', '15', 'B', '19', 'B', '20', 'B', 'second', 'set', 'following', 'discs', 'would', 'not', 'load', '5', 'B', '15', '19', 'B', '20', 'B', 'point', 'gave', 'up', 'did', 'not', 'check', 'rest', 'discs', 'second', 'set', 'sets', 'were', 'returned', 'Amazon', 'was', 'professional', 'it.So', 'are', 'want', 'see', '300', 'episodes', 'paid', 'check', 'disc', 'DVD', 'player', 'when', 'set', 'arrives', 'can', 'get', 'set', 'defect-free', 'then', 'have', 'gotten', 'real', 'low-priced', 'treasure', 'trove', 'great', 'TV', 'viewing']",Classic TV Westerns 300 Episodes
