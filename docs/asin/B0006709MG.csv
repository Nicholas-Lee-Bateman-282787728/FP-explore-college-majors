861956,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B0006709MG,A. Estes,"[39, 41]","""Alive At Red Rocks,"" Incubus' third DVD release is quite a gem for any Incubus fan to have. The entire 19 song (almost 2 hours) set the band peformed on July 26, 2004 at the legendary Red Rocks amphitheater is presented on this set, along with a bonus audio CD of extra material. You really can't go wrong with this package. Incubus put out one of the most energetic performances on this disc, with some of the best songs from all four of their major label full-length releases (mostly favoring material from ""Make Yourself"" and ""A Crow Left Of The Murder""). Sure, material from the ""Fungus Amongus/Enjoy Incubus"" era is missed and the band does pass over a few obvious hits (i.e. ""New Skin"" and ""Warning""), but the quality of the show and the performance by the band more than makes up for these minor flaws. As always, as heard in just about every live recording of Incubus, the band spices up some of their more familiar tunes with some jam sessions or all together alternate compositions. Most noticeably in this set is their alteration of ""Drive"" which has a completely different musical landscape than the original. The sprawling ""Sick Sad Little World"" is extended into an eleven minute piece (which is great, seeing as it is my personal favorite from ""ACLOTM"") and fan favorites like ""A Certain Shade Of Green"" and ""The Warmth"" make worthy appearances. The concert is thoroughly entertaining and the crowd compliments the band's energy very well. Also included on the DVD is about thirteen minutes of behind-the-scenes footage, mostly covering the pre-show routine. The CD portion contains five bonus tracks, two of which are live songs (""Circles"" and ""Are You In?"") that, oddly enough, are not from this particular concert. ""Monuments & Melodies"" is a great song, a leftover from their latest album (also on the ""Megalomaniac"" single), while two new songs, ""Pantomime"" and ""Follow"" are included. ""Pantomime"" is a straight-forward song that is also performed during the concert (with frontman Brandon Boyd on guitar) and ""Follow"" is one of the songs recorded for the ""Halo 2"" videogame. Altogether, an excellent package for any Incubus fan. Like I said before, you can't go wrong with this. Incubus put on a great show and the extra disc just makes it that much better. Even if you haven't been to one of their shows (I haven't), you can still appreciate this. To those who were at this show, I envy you.",5,Incubus At Their Best,1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,2413,"['Alive', 'Red', 'Rocks', 'Incubus', 'third', 'DVD', 'release', 'quite', 'gem', 'Incubus', 'fan', 'have', 'entire', '19', 'song', 'almost', '2', 'hours', 'set', 'band', 'peformed', 'July', '26', '2004', 'legendary', 'Red', 'Rocks', 'amphitheater', 'presented', 'set', 'bonus', 'audio', 'CD', 'extra', 'material', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'package', 'Incubus', 'put', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'energetic', 'performances', 'disc', 'best', 'songs', 'four', 'major', 'label', 'full-length', 'releases', 'mostly', 'favoring', 'material', 'Make', 'Crow', 'Left', 'Murder', 'Sure', 'material', 'Fungus', 'Amongus/Enjoy', 'Incubus', 'era', 'missed', 'band', 'pass', 'few', 'obvious', 'hits', 'i.e', 'New', 'Skin', 'Warning', 'quality', 'show', 'performance', 'band', 'more', 'up', 'minor', 'flaws', 'always', 'heard', 'just', 'live', 'recording', 'Incubus', 'band', 'up', 'more', 'familiar', 'tunes', 'jam', 'sessions', 'together', 'alternate', 'compositions', 'Most', 'noticeably', 'set', 'alteration', 'Drive', 'completely', 'different', 'musical', 'landscape', 'original', 'sprawling', 'Sick', 'Sad', 'Little', 'World', 'extended', 'eleven', 'minute', 'piece', 'great', 'seeing', 'personal', 'favorite', 'ACLOTM', 'fan', 'favorites', 'A', 'Certain', 'Shade', 'Green', 'Warmth', 'make', 'worthy', 'appearances', 'concert', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'crowd', 'band', 'energy', 'very', 'well', 'Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'thirteen', 'minutes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'mostly', 'covering', 'pre-show', 'routine', 'CD', 'portion', 'five', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'two', 'are', 'live', 'songs', 'Circles', 'Are', 'oddly', 'enough', 'are', 'not', 'particular', 'concert', 'Monuments', 'Melodies', 'great', 'song', 'leftover', 'latest', 'album', 'also', 'Megalomaniac', 'single', 'two', 'new', 'songs', 'Pantomime', 'Follow', 'are', 'included', 'Pantomime', 'straight-forward', 'song', 'also', 'performed', 'concert', 'frontman', 'Brandon', 'Boyd', 'guitar', 'Follow', 'one', 'songs', 'recorded', 'Halo', '2', 'videogame', 'Altogether', 'excellent', 'package', 'Incubus', 'fan', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Incubus', 'put', 'great', 'show', 'extra', 'disc', 'just', 'much', 'better', 'Even', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'one', 'shows', 'have', ""n't"", 'can', 'still', 'appreciate', 'who', 'were', 'show', 'envy']",N/A
861957,AX94XE2KY5WK4,B0006709MG,"Alan Pounds ""Al's Music & Movies""","[22, 25]","Forget the days when Incubus simulated the sounds of Rage Against The Machine, Korn or the Red Hot Chili Peppers in their post-grunge days. Incubus is moving forward with their own brand of originality, making ""Alive at Red Rocks"" a must see.""Fungus Amongus"" (1995) brought the world a funkier version of Rage Against The Machine. 1997's ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E."" was a huge step forward. Although they jumped into the whole rap-metal mess with Limp Bizkit and Korn, the record was much more endearing, mainly due to the fact that the band's hip-hop influence came from the DJ as opposed to Brandon Boyd (singer). ""Make Yourself"" (1999) showed Incubus really settling into their sound, reminiscent of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' funk-rock style, sounding much more comfortable than their past efforts. It's also been their most successful mainstream hit to date. The lessons from ""Make Yourself"" definitely apply to their follow-up 2001 release of ""Morning View"", where they ditch the nu-metal/rap-metal sound and focus on expanding the sounds of ""Make Yourself"". ""A Crow Left of the Murder"" marks their most significant and welcomed change in years. You don't get the sense that Incubus sounds like other bands on this record, it simply sounds like Incubus; fresh, original and mind-blowing. If you are like myself, welcoming change in an artistically growing band, and not whining about how they should return to the rap/metal days of ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E."", you are just gonna love this DVD!Everyone in the band pulls their weight flawlessly in this concert. Every member gets their jaw dropping moments to shine in the show. Brandon Boyd has never sounded better, hitting those highs, lows and everything in between cleaner and clearer than ever. Ben Kenney (former Roots bassist) shows why he is definitely the man for the job, turning out gnarly bass solos, and a sweet drum solo in the percussion jaunt featured on ""Vitamin"". Jos&eacute; Pasillas shocked the hell out of me with his killer drum solo also featured on ""Vitamin"". He is a much more talented drummer than I first thought. I don't even know where to start with the guitarist Mike Einziger. I've seen two other Incubus shows on DVD, and Mike baffled me this time. He has always been a fantastic guitarist, but you will never realize how good he actually is until you hear him belt out the solos on songs like ""Priceless"" and ""Sick, Sad Little World"". I was in awe of the speed, timing and precision he displayed. Since Incubus has a ""jam band"" side to them, those solos get stretched out like mad, making it even more enjoyable than the album versions. One of the main reasons I bought this DVD was to see how well Mike would be able to pull off the solo on ""Sick, Sad Little World""; you will NOT be disappointed.This is definitely Incubus' quintessential live performance. No die hard Incubus fan would be missing this DVD is their discography.",5,An amazing display of growth and talent,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,2897,"['Forget', 'days', 'when', 'Incubus', 'simulated', 'sounds', 'Rage', 'Against', 'Machine', 'Korn', 'Red', 'Hot', 'Chili', 'Peppers', 'post-grunge', 'days', 'Incubus', 'moving', 'forward', 'own', 'brand', 'originality', 'making', 'Alive', 'Red', 'Rocks', 'must', 'see', 'Fungus', 'Amongus', '1995', 'brought', 'world', 'funkier', 'version', 'Rage', 'Against', 'Machine', '1997', 'S.C.I.E.N.C.E', 'was', 'huge', 'step', 'forward', 'jumped', 'whole', 'rap-metal', 'mess', 'Limp', 'Bizkit', 'Korn', 'record', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'endearing', 'mainly', 'due', 'fact', 'band', 'hip-hop', 'influence', 'came', 'DJ', 'opposed', 'Brandon', 'Boyd', 'singer', 'Make', '1999', 'showed', 'Incubus', 'really', 'settling', 'sound', 'reminiscent', 'Red', 'Hot', 'Chili', 'Peppers', 'funk-rock', 'style', 'sounding', 'much', 'more', 'comfortable', 'past', 'efforts', 'also', 'been', 'most', 'successful', 'mainstream', 'hit', 'date', 'lessons', 'Make', 'definitely', 'apply', 'follow-up', '2001', 'release', 'Morning', 'View', 'where', 'ditch', 'nu-metal/rap-metal', 'sound', 'focus', 'expanding', 'sounds', 'Make', 'Crow', 'Left', 'Murder', 'marks', 'most', 'significant', 'welcomed', 'change', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'Incubus', 'other', 'bands', 'record', 'simply', 'Incubus', 'fresh', 'original', 'mind-blowing', 'are', 'welcoming', 'change', 'artistically', 'growing', 'band', 'not', 'whining', 'how', 'should', 'return', 'rap/metal', 'days', 'S.C.I.E.N.C.E', 'are', 'just', 'gon', 'love', 'DVD', 'Everyone', 'band', 'weight', 'flawlessly', 'concert', 'member', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'moments', 'shine', 'show', 'Brandon', 'Boyd', 'never', 'sounded', 'better', 'hitting', 'highs', 'lows', 'everything', 'cleaner', 'clearer', 'ever', 'Ben', 'Kenney', 'former', 'Roots', 'bassist', 'why', 'definitely', 'man', 'job', 'turning', 'out', 'gnarly', 'bass', 'solos', 'sweet', 'drum', 'solo', 'percussion', 'jaunt', 'featured', 'Vitamin', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Pasillas', 'shocked', 'hell', 'killer', 'drum', 'solo', 'also', 'featured', 'Vitamin', 'much', 'more', 'talented', 'drummer', 'first', 'thought', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'start', 'guitarist', 'Mike', 'Einziger', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'other', 'Incubus', 'shows', 'DVD', 'Mike', 'baffled', 'time', 'always', 'been', 'fantastic', 'guitarist', 'will', 'never', 'realize', 'how', 'good', 'actually', 'hear', 'belt', 'out', 'solos', 'songs', 'Priceless', 'Sick', 'Sad', 'Little', 'World', 'was', 'awe', 'speed', 'timing', 'precision', 'displayed', 'Incubus', 'jam', 'band', 'side', 'solos', 'get', 'stretched', 'out', 'mad', 'making', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'album', 'versions', 'One', 'main', 'reasons', 'bought', 'DVD', 'was', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'Mike', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'solo', 'Sick', 'Sad', 'Little', 'World', 'will', 'NOT', 'be', 'disappointed.This', 'definitely', 'Incubus', 'quintessential', 'live', 'performance', 'die', 'hard', 'Incubus', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'missing', 'DVD', 'discography']",N/A

So the newer stuff doesn't sit too well with me. I bought this mainly because I wanted to see some impressive audio and visuals on my equipment. The visuals, I agree, are stunning. Although the crowd noise was mastered into the recording which i think is ridiculous. Its like they put microphones in the audience, and called that your two rear channels. I was disgusted, you can hear the reverb and feedback throughout the hole performance. I guess I am picky, because i am a musician myself, and i bought the BD pretty much to hear the guitarist, who in my books is very talented. He seems pretty lifeless in this performance which is disappointing. I know i have the only bad review of this recording, but I was displeased with the mastering quality. If you really have to have this recording, get the DVD and not the blu ray, because the audio is disgusting. I don't go to rock concerts because i got sick of everyone shouting or singing during the songs, because I actually want to hear what is going on musically. So I expected to eliminate the majority of crowd noise with the blu ray release but that didn't happen.

861962,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B0006709MG,Brett Corkins,"[1, 1]","I just bought this and I have to say that this is the best DVD by Incubus to date. The DVD alone is worth the price, but the extra disc is a final touch to the already perfect outcome. I haven't seen a crowd this huge since I last saw the Rage Against The Machine video. Incubus really knows what to give their fans, which is why I think they're so popular. The fact that they sound absolutely perfect live could be another reason though. They're setlist is amazing too, every song I love on A Crow Left Of The Murder (with the exception of Leech) is on here. Plus a few old favorites as well. The crowd grows so loud at times that they overpower the vocals of Brandon. He often says how amazed he is too, and the little chit chat in between songs is a joy to listen to. I really can't explain how inspiring this release is, and I don't think many people can. The extras show how much character Incubus have on and off stage, which is fun to see also.Just a few of the best songs on here are Priceless (which I'm quickly learning could be one of the best songs Incubus plays live), Beware! Criminal, Drive, and Pardon Me. Every song on here is a personal favorite so it was very difficult to decipher favorites.
