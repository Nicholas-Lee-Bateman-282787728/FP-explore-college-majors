429553,A21UUO3LE3SDGD,6304611641,CWC,"[5, 14]","I actually did look forward to the release of this film due to the premise of the plot and being a sucker for a good romantic comedy. An added bonus was that Scott Winant of ""thirtysomething"" fame (my all-time favorite television show) was the director/producer. Simple plot- two people meet briefly throughout their lives on parallel courses until their lives become involved with the future of an old apartment building slated for demolition. The Fates enlighten them with the realization that they are soulmates destined to meet and fall in love. Well, I was a sucker- for going to see this movie! I can't think of another movie that got yanked out of my local cinema faster than this one was (less than a week). I can't think of another movie in recent memory that I checked my watch as many times as I did during this flick. It was more exciting to look at my watch dial than the movie screen.While the story did have brief flashes of brillance in some of the dialog pertaining to life philosophies, they were few and far between. Dylan McDermott, always a good actor, absolutely flubs here. Sarah Jessica Parker, never one of my favorite actresses, looks so bad in this film to me that I was afraid my eyes were going to bleed... I guess I couldn't look away every time she was on the screen for that reason. Jean Tripplehorn's attempts at physical comedy left me gasping. Everytime she was hit with something or knocked down or fell, I wanted to jump into the movie and yell at the director (or call PETA) for torturing this poor woman that way. At least Jennifer Aniston and Ken Olin had the good sense to save their careers by appearing only briefly in minor supporting roles.The self-angsting dialogue on ""thirtysomething"" worked incredibly well and bonded you to the characters. In this movie, listening to the characters bemoan their life circumstances you finally say, ""Enough is enough!"" and hope they all get hit by a bus so they stop talking. The plot flows along very disjointedly and at a very slow pace. I felt no chemistry between the two main characters, who are destined to meet and fall in love. The finale takes a sudden awkward jump a few years later when the couple are married and putting their child to bed. How the plot/premise went from ""A"" to ""B"" (how this couple fell in love and decided to make a life commitment) was left unanswered by the film and made the ending very unsatisifying, disappointing, and unbelievable.Whoever the hair stylist was for this film should never work again. &lt;heh heh> Mr. McDermott has a great head of hair. His greased look in this film- not a ""successful architect style"", that's for sure- terrible and very distracting! Ms. Parker's hair style?? My nightmares as a 5 year old were not as scary as this disaster on her head!In all fairness, I will say some one good thing about this film. The cinematography is wonderful, especially around the apartment complex. You always see this dust, fuzz, or pussy willow type stuff floating in the air in the building's courtyard. I'm still trying to figure out the symbolism intended by the director of this effect. There are quite a few recognizable name actors in this film, but remember ""Mars Attacks""? The film is such a flub, it is one of those movies you will want to watch more than once because the acting and dialogue are so bad.... like a horrible car wreck with blood, gore, and screams of agony- you can't take your eyes away! (heh heh) I always put this movie on when I'm in a masochistic mood and feel the need to be punished by Hollywood.",1,So bad- you have to watch it- again and again.,1053129600,"05 17, 2003",2003,3560,"['actually', 'did', 'look', 'forward', 'release', 'film', 'due', 'premise', 'plot', 'being', 'sucker', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'added', 'bonus', 'was', 'Scott', 'Winant', 'thirtysomething', 'fame', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'director/producer', 'Simple', 'plot-', 'two', 'people', 'meet', 'briefly', 'lives', 'parallel', 'courses', 'lives', 'become', 'involved', 'future', 'old', 'apartment', 'building', 'slated', 'demolition', 'Fates', 'enlighten', 'realization', 'are', 'soulmates', 'destined', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'Well', 'was', 'sucker-', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'got', 'yanked', 'local', 'cinema', 'faster', 'one', 'was', 'less', 'week', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'recent', 'memory', 'checked', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'flick', 'was', 'more', 'exciting', 'look', 'watch', 'dial', 'movie', 'story', 'did', 'have', 'brief', 'flashes', 'brillance', 'dialog', 'pertaining', 'life', 'philosophies', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'always', 'good', 'actor', 'absolutely', 'flubs', 'here', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'never', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'so', 'bad', 'film', 'was', 'afraid', 'eyes', 'were', 'going', 'bleed', 'guess', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'time', 'was', 'screen', 'reason', 'Jean', 'Tripplehorn', 'attempts', 'physical', 'comedy', 'left', 'gasping', 'Everytime', 'was', 'hit', 'something', 'knocked', 'down', 'fell', 'wanted', 'jump', 'movie', 'yell', 'director', 'call', 'PETA', 'torturing', 'poor', 'woman', 'way', 'least', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Ken', 'Olin', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'save', 'careers', 'appearing', 'only', 'briefly', 'minor', 'supporting', 'roles.The', 'self-angsting', 'dialogue', 'thirtysomething', 'worked', 'incredibly', 'well', 'bonded', 'characters', 'movie', 'listening', 'characters', 'bemoan', 'life', 'circumstances', 'finally', 'say', 'Enough', 'enough', 'hope', 'get', 'hit', 'bus', 'stop', 'talking', 'plot', 'along', 'very', 'disjointedly', 'very', 'slow', 'pace', 'felt', 'chemistry', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'destined', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'finale', 'sudden', 'awkward', 'jump', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'couple', 'are', 'married', 'putting', 'child', 'bed', 'How', 'plot/premise', 'went', 'A', 'B', 'how', 'couple', 'fell', 'love', 'decided', 'make', 'life', 'commitment', 'was', 'left', 'unanswered', 'film', 'made', 'ending', 'very', 'unsatisifying', 'disappointing', 'hair', 'stylist', 'was', 'film', 'should', 'never', 'work', 'again', 'lt', 'heh', '>', 'Mr.', 'McDermott', 'great', 'head', 'hair', 'greased', 'look', 'film-', 'not', 'successful', 'architect', 'style', 'sure-', 'terrible', 'very', 'distracting', 'Ms.', 'Parker', 'hair', 'style', 'nightmares', '5', 'year', 'old', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'scary', 'disaster', 'head', 'fairness', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'apartment', 'complex', 'always', 'see', 'dust', 'fuzz', 'pussy', 'willow', 'type', 'stuff', 'floating', 'air', 'building', 'courtyard', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'symbolism', 'intended', 'director', 'effect', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'recognizable', 'name', 'actors', 'film', 'remember', 'Mars', 'Attacks', 'film', 'flub', 'one', 'movies', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'horrible', 'car', 'wreck', 'blood', 'gore', 'screams', 'agony-', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'away', 'heh', 'heh', 'always', 'put', 'movie', 'when', ""'m"", 'masochistic', 'mood', 'feel', 'need', 'be', 'punished', 'Hollywood']",Til There Was You VHS
429554,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6304611641,D. Litton,"[7, 26]","It's no surprise that &quot;'Til There Was You,&quot; the feature film directorial debut of television director Scott Winant, ends up feeling like a  two-hour special episode of a sitcom. While the movie tries to pull off a predictable and ridiculous plot by forcing us into the lives of two people meant to fall in love more than 20 years after they initially meet, it only serves to show us just how uninvolving and dreary their lives are, until we are so starved for something, ANYTHING, to happen that we wish they would just get it on and be done with it.It doesn't help the movie that the beginning is a mess, and as it plods on, the script does little more than add insult to injury. It opens with the lives of youngsters Gwen and Nick (played as adults by Jeanne Tripplehorn and Dylan McDermott): Gwen's mother is a controlling feminist who won't let her father finish a sentence, while Nick's father is a drunkard who won't find a decent job.Soon, they're all grown up, with fancy jobs they never seem to work at, and lives that are less than appealing. Gwen is a ghost writer who believes that everything in life will be picture perfect once she finds the right man for her, while Nick is an architect who has trouble with commitment to just about everything. How these two people could ever share a life together is beyond me, but the movie will spend its entire proving me wrong, changing their lives in ways you won't want to bear witness to without a sedative on hand.If this weren't enough to completely bore someone to tears, the plot hook takes almost an hour to arrive, centering around an apartment building known as La Fortuna, which is owned by former child star Francesca (Sarah Jessica Parker), who played the role of Taffy in the 60's sitcom &quot;On Big Happy Family&quot; (looks strangely akin to &quot;The Brady Bunch,&quot; only cornier). The building is the only structure standing in the way of a larger complex helmed by Nick's company; of course, Nick falls for her charms, lands her a big deal, and they fall in love, right about the same time that Gwen moves into La Fortuna and becomes acquainted with all of her neighbors.There are forces at work in this film you would not believe, predictability topping the list. Here is a movie that virtually goes nowhere, choosing to take the weary, well-worn paths of so many romantic comedies before it that there is no plot twist or story line we don't see coming at least half an hour before it appears. Much of the movie feels slapped together, with certain scenes that have no impact on the overall plot other than to add to the already-lengthy running time. One doesn't even get the feeling that there is an attempt being made to stitch something plausible together amidst the dreck, and that's something that could give it the push it so desperately needed.The attempts at romance and comedy are listless and unremarkable. Winant wastes no time in making Gwen out to be little more than a hopeless romantic, as well as a hopeless idiot, who is prone to running into things, losing her balance and falling into various people, causing accidents, losing her line of thought, etc. The film wastes Tripplehorn, as well as McDermott, who's character is a typical man who sees the light at the end of the tunnel, though there's not a minute of believable emotion present. Even Parker can't save the day, her sluttish blonde bimbo coming off as tawdry but evoking little humor.For those who enjoy films with no sense, and like knowing how it will all turn out, then this movie will no doubt rank as a winner. Anyone else will find themselves drowning in one of the most insipid, ludicrous, and monotonously ongoing gab fests they've ever encountered.
