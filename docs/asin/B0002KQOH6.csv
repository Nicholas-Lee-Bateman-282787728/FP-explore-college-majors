838853,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B0002KQOH6,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 3]","This Russian film is a departure from the norm thriller/psychological drama, in that it offers so little information, you draw your own conclusions... seriously; you, the viewer write the storyline.  The film offers little dialogue and clearly, no explanations. Like any other film, you keep waiting for something that throws a clue your way.  Waiting and waiting...nothing.  The suspense continues.Two brothers have grown up with a mother and grandmother, and without a father, who one day returns after a 12 year disappearance, nothing said, nothing to give us a clue of his whereabouts.  One morning, the kids find him in bed; he comes to the breakfast table without even as much as a hello to the boys.  It's mysterious.  That scene is predictory of his character throughout the film.Next thing we know, he is taking them on a fishing trip to the wilderness, specifically to an island.  The father is rough, mentally and physically; and why this journey we don't know.  One thing, he demands that the boys call him father, but the younger one, Ivan refuses.  Ivan has more hostility and resentment against the man, while the other boy, 15 year old Andre, obliges and tries to bond.Compliant, 15-year old wants to believe in a father, but the younger Ivan is skeptical, fearful, and said he could love him, if he saw a good side of the man.  He hated the father.  The acting is brilliant; we see the cold, untouchable father, unwilling to bend.  Child actor Ivan was amazing for his age.  So much emotion exudes from his little face and so much for a young boy to endure.I doubt that I have seen a movie like this, tormenting, mysterious, and thrilling that provides such little detail.  The best one can do is pick up some clues from his behavior.  You need to think, analyze, speculate, and it becomes a story of your mind.  .... Rizzo",5,Where ya been?  What ya doing?

Throughout the movie you wonder why the father all of the sudden shows up, what is he involved in? The father seems to be involved with some shady business enterprise.  Is the father ever going to try to get along with his boys? It seems like near the end he might attempt to make amends with one of the boys but the father has an accident.Then there is a box that the father digs up on an island they camp on. The father knows exactly where to find this box, the boys never find out about the box because it sinks with the boat in the lake. At least we could have found out what was in the box.I could deal with not knowing some details about the father's life, but can't we have a little dialogue between the father and the boys with the father telling them a little about his life?  Plus maybe the father telling him why he was gone for so many years?  I guess the director wanted us to be like the boys who never find out to why the father came back.  Also for us to be like the boys who never learn much about their father but only know him as a mean, grumpy, and crouchy man with little patience.

I saw around 18 films and this one is one best films that week. While watching it I was mesmerized by the cinematography and the landscapes shown throughout the film. It was filmed in beautiful locations, inside and outside the city. I notices a few relegious references (the father is almost a christ-like figure), but at the time didnt think too much about them. Now I know there are even more in the film. Im not saying this is a religious film. I went to see it with a few friends and talked with others who saw it after watching it, and nobody noticed those references, which surprised me quite a bit. However its more than that, in the end the director doesnt give you all the answers, and it will be up to you to figure out what happened, if it actually did happen at all. You can see it as a religious film, as a film about the new and old Russia, or as a film about two brothers who never had a father and one day he comes back to show them important thing that will help them survive through life.

A pair of boys (a teenager and his younger brother) live with their mother in a decrepit town in northwestern Russia. Suddenly, their absent father returns (a rude and authoritarian figure, who it is suggested, has been a military pilot) and brings them to a mysterious island for what is presumably a fishing trip. But, as it turns out, in the island a treasure is buried, perhaps from a burglary from which the father might be connected. The older brother adores his father, while the younger one loathes him. The father becomes growingly brutal, and as the movie suspense increases, everything points out to a final tragedy. Fine performances by everybody, but specially the boys (sadly, after the movie was shot, the actor playing the older brother die in the lake shown in the movie, in a scene eerily reminiscent of one portrayed in the film).

838858,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0002KQOH6,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I was wondering how I could start this review, and it dawned on me that the best way to convey the meaning this film has for me is to simply state, matter-of-factly, just what it is about this moving that touches me.  Fatherhood.  Yes, being a father myself, I am always drawn to films that express the varying degrees of fatherhood; from the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly.  2003 was one of those years that stands out for me in the way the fatherly role was exposed and elaborated on.  Some of my favorite films from that year took the time to explore facets of this `character'.  `In America', `Master and Commander' (obviously from a symbolic way), `Finding Nemo', `Pieces of April', `Big Fish'; all of them reach that part of me very deeply.Of them all, this is by far my favorite.""Who's sleeping?""This Russian film details a week long trip taken by two young boys and their long lost father.  After a twelve year absence, he returns without warning and decides to take his sons fishing.  The trip, littered with ambiguities, fights, questions and tragedy, will forever change young Andrei and Ivan (often referred to as Vanya).  Young Ivan is the most affected, both before and after the trip, as he struggles with his own perception of this man he (begrudgingly) calls `father'.""There's all kinds of grown-ups.""What I found so beautifully moving about this film is that it never once tried to force our emotions.  We are presented with a scenario, and the people involved push us in all different directions, but in the end it is left up to us to decide just how we feel about the individuals involved.  By shying away from an easy answer (there has been a lot of talk about the ending being too ambiguous, but for me the ambiguity is what makes this film so poignant) a broader range of emotional entitlement is allowed.  We can see the shades of pain that come from loss, no matter how much we know or don't know about a person.  Ivan is so clueless as to who his father truly is, but his anger, frustration, resentment and malice is all wrapped up in an undeniable love and affection.  He wants so badly to understand, but he fervently refuses to try.""With our little hands.""Presenting to the audience an honest and emotionally gripping exploration of that bond between father and son, `Vozvrashchenie' nails everything needed to cement itself in the mind of the audience.  The flawless performances of the three leads are only illuminated by the beautiful camera work (the gritty realism brought to the stunning cinematography is hauntingly effective) and the poignant and provocative script.  Each emotion is felt long after the scene has ended.""Go get the ax.""Oh, and just a little piece of advice; don't worry so much about what is IN the box, focus on what the box represents.",5,Haunting...,1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,2799,"['was', 'wondering', 'how', 'could', 'start', 'review', 'dawned', 'best', 'way', 'convey', 'meaning', 'film', 'simply', 'state', 'matter-of-factly', 'just', 'what', 'moving', 'touches', 'Fatherhood', 'Yes', 'being', 'father', 'am', 'always', 'drawn', 'films', 'express', 'varying', 'degrees', 'fatherhood', 'good', 'bad', 'beautiful', 'ugly', '2003', 'was', 'one', 'years', 'out', 'way', 'fatherly', 'role', 'was', 'exposed', 'elaborated', 'favorite', 'films', 'year', 'took', 'time', 'explore', 'facets', 'character', 'America', 'Master', 'Commander', 'obviously', 'symbolic', 'way', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Pieces', 'April', 'Big', 'Fish', 'reach', 'part', 'very', 'deeply.Of', 'far', 'favorite', 'Who', 'sleeping', 'Russian', 'film', 'details', 'week', 'long', 'trip', 'taken', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'long', 'lost', 'father', 'twelve', 'year', 'absence', 'warning', 'take', 'sons', 'fishing', 'trip', 'littered', 'ambiguities', 'fights', 'questions', 'tragedy', 'will', 'forever', 'change', 'young', 'Andrei', 'Ivan', 'often', 'referred', 'Vanya', 'Young', 'Ivan', 'most', 'affected', 'trip', 'own', 'perception', 'man', 'begrudgingly', 'father', 'kinds', 'grown-ups', 'What', 'found', 'so', 'beautifully', 'moving', 'film', 'never', 'once', 'tried', 'force', 'emotions', 'are', 'presented', 'scenario', 'people', 'involved', 'push', 'different', 'directions', 'end', 'left', 'up', 'decide', 'just', 'how', 'feel', 'individuals', 'involved', 'shying', 'away', 'easy', 'answer', 'been', 'lot', 'talk', 'ending', 'being', 'too', 'ambiguous', 'ambiguity', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'poignant', 'broader', 'range', 'emotional', 'entitlement', 'allowed', 'can', 'see', 'shades', 'pain', 'come', 'loss', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'person', 'Ivan', 'so', 'clueless', 'who', 'father', 'truly', 'anger', 'frustration', 'resentment', 'malice', 'wrapped', 'up', 'undeniable', 'love', 'affection', 'so', 'badly', 'understand', 'fervently', 'try', 'little', 'hands', 'Presenting', 'audience', 'honest', 'emotionally', 'gripping', 'exploration', 'bond', 'father', 'son', 'Vozvrashchenie', 'nails', 'everything', 'needed', 'cement', 'mind', 'audience', 'flawless', 'performances', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'only', 'illuminated', 'beautiful', 'camera', 'work', 'gritty', 'realism', 'brought', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'hauntingly', 'effective', 'poignant', 'provocative', 'script', 'emotion', 'felt', 'long', 'scene', 'ended', 'Go', 'get', 'ax', 'Oh', 'just', 'little', 'piece', 'advice', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'IN', 'box', 'focus', 'what', 'box']",The Return

This is an incredible film with layer upon layer of meaning and interpretation.  The writers, the cinematographer and director demonstrate nothing short of genius here.It's tough to even begin to talk about the movie without revealing too much.  A father - gone for 12 years - returns.  Prison?  Mafia?  These are the prosaic reasons my wife and I came up with.  A 63-minute documentatary on the DVD gives you some insight into the shoot, the funding, how the project came together, etc.  But the essence of the film itself - the script, the story concept, its staging - remains inscrutable and opaque.  But after seeing the viewer commentary posted on IMDB, I realized that my understanding of the film had only scratched the surface...there are overtly religious overtones at play here (including one spot-on restaging of Andrea Mantegna's ""The Dead Christ""), some possible commentary about the last days of Communism vs. the 'new' Russia, and one further interpretation about the brothers and their diary that completely turned the movie on its head and - upon further review and thinking - I now see as a brilliant revelation.  Again: it's genius that Zvyagintsev and crew have layered all this in and have us all talking and interpreting and re-thinking.I had come here with the intention of waxing poetic about the acting skills of 'younger son' Ivan, as played masterfully by Ivan Dobronravov.  But nothing I say is going to top the previous reviewer's comment that he makes Haley Joel Osmont (in 'The Sixth Sense') look like the red-headed kid from Different Strokes.  Now, that's a brilliant way to state it.  Touch&eacute;, sir!Tragically, this will be Vladimir Garin's (elder son Andrey) only film.  He drowned shortly after the filming completed and before the movie hit the big screen in art houses here in mid-2004.  He wasn't as strong an actor as young Dobronravov, but towards the end of the film, you can feel him gaining confidence.

The very next day, he takes them both on a fishing trip, which doesn't really turn out to be an actual fishing trip. These two boys are constantly ignored, insulted, and ordered around by their father in what seems to be a deadly test of will and manhood.What makes this foreign film so special is that it's a truly original experience. There's no sappy Hollywood music, no melodramatic fluff, and (best of all) no ADD-induced cinematography. The direction of this film is ponderous and straightforward, which really heightens the suspense. The neverending mysteries surrounding the father makes the film: we never know why he acts the way it is, and that's why we don't fully trust the character. Why is he uncomfortable with fish? Why does he scorn his own sons? These questions become more natural as, near the end, we desperately want to know why he's become a (silent) drill sergeant rather than a real parent.Director Zvyagintsev has given us a fine psychological thriller. The look and feel of ""The Return"" is something that we don't usually see in today's American thrillers. The actors, especially the kids, have done a splendid job. They actually turn out to look and act believable in their roles. Tragically, though, Vladimir Garin (who plays Andrey) died shortly before the premiere of this film.

Two brothers, 15 year old Andrei and 12 year old Ivan who are very close, live with their mother and grandmother thinking that their father was dead. One day, the father returns after 12 year absence and on the next day, he takes the boys on the week long fishing trip. For all three of them, the trip changed their lives forever.The Return is an impressive debut by Andrei Zvaygintsev. His camera man Mikhail Krichman and two young actors deserve the praise and the awards. But when I read that Zvyagintsev is Tarkovsky reincarnated and the film is as deep and meaningful as the best Bergman's works, I don't buy it. Why did the father insist on taking the sons with him while his reason to go to the mysterious island was far from fishing? Am I to believe that the best the father could do after 12 years absence was to humiliate and to treat his sons as a drill sergeant? The most important and emotional, central to the film scene on the island with the screams, tears, and hatred felt like so called ""Dostoyevshina"" - a la Dostoyevsky but without his pain, anger, and talent. Dostoyevsky would've gone deep inside his character's soul and heart to give us the reasons for his actions - in ""The Return"" I had to take the director's and writer's words for granted and it is hard for me to do. What did I learn? That the fathers see themselves in their sons, hate themselves and try to break their children so the children will not repeat their (fathers') mistakes? That ""The father always knows better?"" That the generation of the children and the parents will never (or too late) understand one another? Or another idea. Maybe the father represents the old, before ""Perestroika"" Russia. Why not? He was absent for 12 years - he disappeared somewhere in the beginning of 1990s - just when Soviet Union ceased to exist and his sons grew in a new country, and there is no place in their world for the dark past which their father embodiments.

Directed with extraordinary, understated, and sensitive perfection by Andrei Zvyagintsev, THE RETURN is a sweeping yet quiet epic story of a small family in Russia, fragmented by the father's desertion of them, and how the two boys and their mother cope with life alone and then with the unexpected arrival of the father after twelve years' absence.Andrei (Vladimir Garin) is the older brother who runs with a gang that one day challenges his younger brother Ivan (Ivan Dobronravov) to follow their game of jumping off a rickety tower into the lake below.  Unable to face the fear of dying, Ivan remains on the perilous tower while his 'friends' leave the 'coward' behind.  Eventually Ivan's mother (the beautiful and sensitive Natalya Vdovina) comes to fetch him and take him home to safety, despite Ivan's remaining feelings of rejection.Abruptly, the boys return home on an average day to discover their mother's warning to be quiet so as not to awake their sleeping father (Konstantin Lavronenko) who has been gone for the important bonding years in the boys' lives.  Once awake the father menacingly tells the boys he will take them on a fishing trip.  Andrei (obviously out of the need to be loved by a father) is eager: Ivan (who fears the 'father' whom he knows only form old photographs) is wary and nearly refuses to go.  But go they do, and begin a few days of quiet discovery that their long absent father is a creature to be feared.The three set camp and build a boat to take out to an island.  What happens on this misadventure is horrifyingly tragic and the boys are left to cope with fate, wholly on their own for survival.  And the film simply ends.There is much more to the simple story than meets the eye (even though the eye is romanced with some of the most evocative, minimalist, atmospheric photography  of a lake in Siberia by cinematographer Mikhail Krichman).  Filial love or lack of same, sibling love, death, coming of age, coping with seemingly impossible ventures, etc fill every frame.  This is one of the most penetratingly cogent films made.  The acting is of the highest order. The musical score by Andrei Dergachyov quietly sets the mood to perfection.  It is sad to realize that the young actor Vladimir Garin (Andrei) drowned in an accident too similar to the diving scene that opens this film.  This event makes this film an even more powerful mood piece.

He takes his sons ostensibly on a fishing trip, but it soon becomes obvious that the father has a hidden agenda. The film is shrouded in mystery, and the mystery itself adds to the film's ever increasing tension. The viewer is more or less seeing the film through the eyes of the sons (although we are privy to some of the father's actions that the sons never see) We never find out where the father has been for 12 years (although we can certainly guess), because the sons never find out; we never know what is in the mysterious box the father retrieves from the island because, even though it is what is motivating him, the sons are never even aware of the existence of this box. We learn from a photograph that the elder son is probably old enough to remember his father before he disappeared, so perhaps that is why he is more willing to just accept the father's return, obviously more anxious to earn his father's praise and approval. The younger was just a baby, and so remembers nothing of his father. He is less accepting of the return and, in fact, seems to deliberately try to provoke the father. The father alternates between harsh, almost military-like discipline and genuine concern. These character traits combine with the moody atmosphere to arrive at an unexpected (if you do not read the reviews that summarize the entire plot) climax and a somewhat ambiguous (or at least unresolved) conclusion.

Mason ""relyonme""","[15, 18]","I'm not sure how to rate this enigmatic movie: as far as cinematography is concerned it should be somewhere between 4 and 5 stars; as far as script is concerned perhaps 2 stars would be more appropriate. I have therefore gone for a Solomonic solution and given it 3 stars overall.That does not mean that it is in any way a bad movie.  It's just that, for all the enthusiastic comments about the mystic marvels of this film, it somehow lacks body.  The fact that it is enigmatic does not in itself mean that it qualifies as a masterpiece.It is very much in the tradition of oriental films, where pace is secondary to ""atmosphere."" If atmosphere were the sole criterion for judging the merits of this particular offering, then 5 stars would be more accurate. I have no objection to adding a good dose of mystery to a story, or indeed, having to scratch my head hard to try and work out what the thing was all about.  Movies that challenge the intellect are certainly up my street.This movie, however, is not so much an intellectual challenge as an exercise in mystery without any real answers to the various questions it raises. There is no payoff, and nothing to be gained by speculating on the whys and wherefores of the characters and plot here. What we have is a beautifully filmed narrative of two boys who are taken by their unknown father on a somewhat testing outing which extends itself to a few days. It might best be described as an exercise in ""bonding,"" although very much in the Russian idiom, which is quite clearly different from what, say, Americans understand by the term. Whilst the two boys, excellently interpreted by the two young actors concerned, are clearly apprehensive as to the background and motives of their father, we,the audience, are left totally in the dark about him. I'm not sure whether this deserves praise or criticism, but it left me decidedly unsatisfied. It may be that the director left the whole thing in suspense so as to provoke the audience's powers of imagination, or simply that the father's story was so banal that leaving a question mark was preferable to telling us more.In any event, to sum up, this beautifully made film which delivers the starkness of Russia in spades, was for me a promise unfulfilled.",3,VERY HARD TO RATE THIS ONE,1244937600,"06 14, 2009",2009,2256,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'rate', 'enigmatic', 'movie', 'as', 'far', 'cinematography', 'concerned', 'should', 'be', 'somewhere', '4', '5', 'stars', 'as', 'far', 'script', 'concerned', 'perhaps', '2', 'stars', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'have', 'therefore', 'gone', 'Solomonic', 'solution', 'given', '3', 'stars', 'overall.That', 'not', 'mean', 'way', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'enthusiastic', 'comments', 'mystic', 'marvels', 'film', 'somehow', 'body', 'fact', 'enigmatic', 'not', 'mean', 'masterpiece.It', 'very', 'much', 'tradition', 'oriental', 'films', 'where', 'pace', 'secondary', 'atmosphere', 'were', 'sole', 'criterion', 'judging', 'merits', 'particular', 'offering', 'then', '5', 'stars', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'have', 'objection', 'adding', 'good', 'dose', 'mystery', 'story', 'indeed', 'having', 'scratch', 'head', 'hard', 'try', 'work', 'out', 'what', 'thing', 'was', 'Movies', 'challenge', 'intellect', 'are', 'certainly', 'street.This', 'movie', 'however', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'intellectual', 'challenge', 'exercise', 'mystery', 'real', 'answers', 'various', 'questions', 'payoff', 'nothing', 'be', 'gained', 'speculating', 'whys', 'wherefores', 'characters', 'plot', 'here', 'What', 'have', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'narrative', 'two', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'taken', 'unknown', 'father', 'somewhat', 'testing', 'outing', 'few', 'days', 'might', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'exercise', 'bonding', 'very', 'much', 'Russian', 'idiom', 'quite', 'clearly', 'different', 'what', 'say', 'Americans', 'understand', 'term', 'Whilst', 'two', 'boys', 'excellently', 'interpreted', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'concerned', 'are', 'clearly', 'apprehensive', 'background', 'motives', 'father', 'audience', 'are', 'left', 'totally', 'dark', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'praise', 'criticism', 'left', 'decidedly', 'unsatisfied', 'may', 'be', 'director', 'left', 'whole', 'thing', 'suspense', 'so', 'provoke', 'audience', 'powers', 'imagination', 'simply', 'father', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'banal', 'leaving', 'question', 'mark', 'was', 'preferable', 'telling', 'more.In', 'event', 'sum', 'up', 'beautifully', 'made', 'film', 'starkness', 'Russia', 'spades', 'was', 'promise', 'unfulfilled']",The Return

They just try to replace that father figure with their connection to the group of teenage boys who challenge one another with dares and who play football, and eventually settle their disagreements with some good old fist fights. The younger brother; Ivan, tries to be up to his elder brother, Andrei, but he can&#8217;t and needs his mother to settle his identity search. The mother and her love-solace. &#8220;Mummy Andrei has torn my shirt!&#8221;Nothing abnormal there for a younger son. Cain and Abem are not far from this situation, the rivalry between two brothers, a dramatic rivalry whose victim is the younger one. But the film breaks that background into a far more tragic outcome.The father comes back after twelve years of absence. And he decides to take them on a fishing trip in the back country. But they do not know how to react to a father. They check his identity with old pictures and they have to accept their mother&#8217;s word too.But it goes both all wrong and all right. All right because the elder son sticks to his father and tries to share this attachment with his younger brother, the two remaining close and sort of non-antagonistic though quite differently-minded allies. All wrong because the father plants a wedge between the two brothers and the younger one develops a systematic and very vocal hostility. The father will not be able to conquer him and in fact this younger brother will lead the elder one into not respecting a rule decided by the father and that will mean some harsh punishment for the elder one and the final peripetian culmination.The trip that should have lasted one or two days turns into one week. And the situation gets worse and worse to the point when the younger one dares his father with a knife and runs away to the top of a lighthouse and the father will come tumbling down from the top to the sand below.And the return of the father to his sons will become the return of the sons with the father&#8217;s body to the mother, at first, and then without the father&#8217;s body, in the crucial moment when they should have loaded him in the homebound car. That ending is an epiphany though because the younger brother will learn then to call after his &#8220;papa&#8221; or his dad, a word he had refused to use very stubbornly till that last moment. The father had in a way succeeded but he will remain a trauma in the memory of the two boys, for ever and ever.A beautiful story about fatherhood and teenage especially because it is tragic, dramatic, traumatic. I guess fathers can often be that, carry in them this authority figure that is more frightening than radiating solace and love. And yet this authority is love, fatherly love and a child needs in their immediate environment these two sorts of love that have been systematically &#8211; and wrongly &#8211; associated to mother and father. These two loves are love-solace and love-authority. Things become wrong when one of the two or even both is or are missing. Children then look for substitutes and that can lead to dramatic situations, including the refusal of this love or these loves when they are encountered.Then the return is a return to reality with a trauma in your mind.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Abel dares Adam who dies at the feet of Cain,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,3315,"['Two', 'teenage', 'boys', 'raised', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'absence', 'father', 'just', 'try', 'replace', 'father', 'figure', 'connection', 'group', 'teenage', 'boys', 'who', 'challenge', 'one', 'dares', 'who', 'play', 'football', 'eventually', 'settle', 'disagreements', 'good', 'old', 'fist', 'fights', 'younger', 'brother', 'Ivan', 'be', 'up', 'elder', 'brother', 'Andrei', 'can', '8217', 't', 'mother', 'settle', 'identity', 'search', 'mother', 'love-solace', '8220', 'Mummy', 'Andrei', 'torn', 'shirt', '8221', 'Nothing', 'younger', 'son', 'Cain', 'Abem', 'are', 'not', 'far', 'situation', 'rivalry', 'two', 'brothers', 'dramatic', 'rivalry', 'victim', 'younger', 'one', 'film', 'breaks', 'background', 'far', 'more', 'tragic', 'outcome.The', 'father', 'back', 'twelve', 'years', 'absence', 'take', 'fishing', 'trip', 'back', 'country', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'react', 'father', 'check', 'identity', 'old', 'pictures', 'have', 'accept', 'mother', '8217', 'word', 'too.But', 'wrong', 'right', 'right', 'elder', 'son', 'sticks', 'father', 'tries', 'share', 'attachment', 'younger', 'brother', 'two', 'remaining', 'close', 'sort', 'non-antagonistic', 'quite', 'differently-minded', 'allies', 'wrong', 'father', 'plants', 'wedge', 'two', 'brothers', 'younger', 'one', 'systematic', 'very', 'vocal', 'hostility', 'father', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'conquer', 'fact', 'younger', 'brother', 'will', 'lead', 'elder', 'one', 'not', 'respecting', 'rule', 'decided', 'father', 'will', 'mean', 'harsh', 'punishment', 'elder', 'one', 'final', 'peripetian', 'culmination.The', 'trip', 'should', 'have', 'lasted', 'one', 'two', 'days', 'one', 'week', 'situation', 'worse', 'worse', 'point', 'when', 'younger', 'one', 'father', 'knife', 'away', 'top', 'lighthouse', 'father', 'will', 'come', 'tumbling', 'top', 'sand', 'return', 'father', 'sons', 'will', 'become', 'return', 'sons', 'father', '8217', 'body', 'mother', 'first', 'then', 'father', '8217', 'body', 'crucial', 'moment', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'loaded', 'homebound', 'car', 'ending', 'epiphany', 'though', 'younger', 'brother', 'will', 'learn', 'then', 'call', '8220', '8221', 'dad', 'word', 'had', 'refused', 'use', 'very', 'stubbornly', 'till', 'last', 'moment', 'father', 'had', 'way', 'succeeded', 'will', 'remain', 'trauma', 'memory', 'two', 'boys', 'ever', 'ever.A', 'beautiful', 'story', 'fatherhood', 'teenage', 'especially', 'tragic', 'dramatic', 'traumatic', 'guess', 'fathers', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'carry', 'authority', 'figure', 'more', 'frightening', 'radiating', 'solace', 'love', 'yet', 'authority', 'love', 'fatherly', 'love', 'child', 'needs', 'immediate', 'environment', 'two', 'sorts', 'love', 'have', 'been', 'systematically', '8211', 'wrongly', '8211', 'associated', 'mother', 'father', 'two', 'loves', 'are', 'love-solace', 'love-authority', 'become', 'wrong', 'when', 'one', 'two', 'even', 'are', 'missing', 'Children', 'then', 'look', 'substitutes', 'can', 'lead', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'including', 'refusal', 'love', 'loves', 'when', 'are', 'encountered.Then', 'return', 'return', 'reality', 'trauma', 'mind.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",The Return

(The town's name is never revealed, but, from the geography seen during the film, is presumably located somewhere on the Baltic.) The younger of the brothers, 12-year old Ivan, is afraid to make the jump, and is subsequently deserted by the others and left alone to get himself and his injured pride down. But Ivan's terror is so great that he eventually has to be rescued by his mother (Natalia Vdovina), whose faded beauty seems out of place in this desolate place. Rejoining his friends the next day, Ivan is jeered as a coward, and chased home by Andrei, where their mother cautions them not to wake their father (Konstatin Lavronenko), who's sleeping. The thing is, you see, Ol' Dad has been mysteriously absent these past twelve years. Ivan only remembers him through an old picture squirreled away in an attic trunk. During their first family meal after he awakens, the atmosphere is strained. Nobody asks, nor does the prodigal parent volunteer, where he's been. (Perhaps the mother knows, but she's not telling.) The father does commit, however, to taking his boys on a lengthy fishing trip beginning the next day.Thus begins a tense journey of non-discovery for father and sons. From the beginning, Andrei seems content to have his Dad back and doesn't question the where and why of his disappearance. For his part, the father seems to be using the fishing expedition as a cover for some other agenda, especially as the trip takes them to an offshore island, where he goes off alone to dig up a box hidden under the floor of an abandoned hut. Towards his sons, he is, at best, remotely solicitous - concerned in some detached way that they grow into self-reliant, strong men; he certainly isn't a pal. At worst, he's physically abusive, and he never talks about his past or his love for his offspring (if, indeed, he has any). Ivan reacts to this emotional chasm with angry resentment and surliness. At one point, he declares to Andrei his readiness to stab his father if the latter touches him. Talk about an attitude problem! This familial dysfunction eventuality leads to tragedy.THE RETURN is a dark story about a conflict of wills - the obstinate Ivan versus his uncommunicative father. It's wonderfully constructed around menacing, yet austerely beautiful, landscapes rendered more stark by a purposely washed-out, almost monochromatic, cinematography. If this is the sort of film that appeals to you, then enjoy. However ...I wanted more. If I wish to observe a battle of wills, then I need only witness my wife trying to get the pet cats to eat a can of feline feast that they don't want. (And you know who wins that contest! Wretched, ungrateful creatures.) While the evolution of the film's plot implies that the father's time away was spent on that island, why was he ever there in the first place? What was in the mysterious box? Those questions were never answered, and I was left muttering with frustration. For that reason, I'm only giving it three stars rather than the five that more sophisticated viewers would perhaps bestow.",3,"A fine ""So, what?""",1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,3454,"['Rarely', ""'ll"", 'see', 'movie', 'unsatisfying', 'way', 'RETURN', 'unusual', 'captured', 'held', 'interest', 'then', 'left', 'unfulfilled', 'very', 'end.THE', 'RETURN', 'group', 'Russian', 'boys', 'including', 'brothers', 'Andrei', 'Vladimir', 'Garin', 'Ivan', 'Ivan', 'Dobronravon', 'leaping', 'water', 'tall', 'observation', 'platform', 'end', 'stone', 'jetty', 'bleak', 'seaside', 'town', 'town', 'name', 'never', 'revealed', 'geography', 'seen', 'film', 'presumably', 'located', 'somewhere', 'Baltic', 'younger', 'brothers', '12-year', 'old', 'Ivan', 'afraid', 'make', 'jump', 'subsequently', 'deserted', 'others', 'left', 'alone', 'get', 'injured', 'pride', 'down', 'Ivan', 'terror', 'so', 'great', 'eventually', 'be', 'rescued', 'mother', 'Natalia', 'Vdovina', 'faded', 'beauty', 'place', 'desolate', 'place', 'Rejoining', 'friends', 'next', 'day', 'Ivan', 'jeered', 'coward', 'chased', 'home', 'Andrei', 'where', 'mother', 'cautions', 'not', 'wake', 'father', 'Konstatin', 'Lavronenko', 'who', 'sleeping', 'thing', 'see', 'Ol', 'Dad', 'been', 'mysteriously', 'absent', 'past', 'twelve', 'years', 'Ivan', 'only', 'remembers', 'old', 'picture', 'squirreled', 'away', 'attic', 'trunk', 'first', 'family', 'meal', 'atmosphere', 'strained', 'Nobody', 'prodigal', 'parent', 'volunteer', 'where', 'been', 'Perhaps', 'mother', 'not', 'telling', 'father', 'commit', 'however', 'taking', 'boys', 'lengthy', 'fishing', 'trip', 'beginning', 'next', 'day.Thus', 'tense', 'journey', 'non-discovery', 'father', 'sons', 'beginning', 'Andrei', 'content', 'have', 'Dad', 'back', ""n't"", 'question', 'where', 'why', 'disappearance', 'part', 'father', 'be', 'using', 'fishing', 'expedition', 'cover', 'other', 'agenda', 'especially', 'trip', 'offshore', 'island', 'where', 'off', 'alone', 'dig', 'up', 'box', 'hidden', 'floor', 'abandoned', 'hut', 'Towards', 'sons', 'best', 'remotely', 'solicitous', 'concerned', 'detached', 'way', 'grow', 'self-reliant', 'strong', 'men', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'pal', 'worst', 'physically', 'abusive', 'never', 'past', 'love', 'offspring', 'indeed', 'Ivan', 'emotional', 'chasm', 'angry', 'resentment', 'surliness', 'one', 'point', 'Andrei', 'readiness', 'stab', 'father', 'latter', 'touches', 'Talk', 'attitude', 'problem', 'familial', 'dysfunction', 'eventuality', 'tragedy.THE', 'RETURN', 'dark', 'story', 'conflict', 'wills', 'obstinate', 'Ivan', 'versus', 'uncommunicative', 'father', 'wonderfully', 'constructed', 'menacing', 'yet', 'austerely', 'beautiful', 'rendered', 'more', 'stark', 'purposely', 'washed-out', 'almost', 'monochromatic', 'cinematography', 'sort', 'film', 'appeals', 'then', 'enjoy', 'However', 'wanted', 'more', 'wish', 'observe', 'battle', 'wills', 'then', 'need', 'only', 'witness', 'wife', 'trying', 'get', 'pet', 'cats', 'eat', 'can', 'feline', 'feast', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'who', 'contest', 'Wretched', 'ungrateful', 'creatures', 'evolution', 'film', 'plot', 'implies', 'father', 'time', 'away', 'was', 'spent', 'island', 'why', 'was', 'ever', 'there', 'first', 'place', 'What', 'was', 'mysterious', 'box', 'questions', 'were', 'never', 'answered', 'was', 'left', 'muttering', 'frustration', 'reason', ""'m"", 'only', 'giving', 'three', 'rather', 'five', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'viewers', 'would', 'perhaps', 'bestow']",The Return

838917,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0002KQOH6,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 8]","Communication brings people closer, as shared information removes obstacles such as guessing and assumptions.  For example, if a person says, ""I am scared.""  People know that the person is scared and it offers an opportunity for people to help the person overcome the fear in one way or another.  Thus, communication also becomes the foundation upon, which education and enlightenment rest.  If communication perished, enlightenment and knowledge would see their final days because the next generation would never receive the information from previous generations.  This displays why communication and why language is so essential for human existence.  The Return illustrates a returning father and his inability to communicate, which will leave the audience in a cerebral no man's land guessing and concocting their own assumptions.The director Andrei Zvyagintsev opens the film by a pier where a large diving tower is located.  Some young teenagers are jumping from the tower while Ivan (Ivan Dobronravov), one of the younger kids, does not jump as her fears height.  His friends and his older brother Andrey (Vladimir Garin) leave him on top of the diving tower whimpering in fear while the cold sea breeze brushes his body.  This leads to a situation where some of Ivan's friends call him a coward, which he denies.  Ivan ends up in fight with his brother, and he runs home to tell his mother while she simply states, ""Don't wake your father.""Flabbergasted the two boys look at their mother, when she says that their father (Konstantin Lavronenko) is at home.  These two boys have not seen their father for over a decade, and now he has returned for whatever reason.  The first thing the father has decided to do is to take the two boys on a fishing trip; however, the trip turns out to be something completely different than what the kids had in mind.Throughout the trip, the father is abusive and rough with Ivan and Andrey.  However, besides this the audience has to follow a trail of suggestive ideas, which leaves the viewer with mere assumptions.  Several reviews have pinpointed this speculative atmosphere in the film that the father in the film generates through his persona, as he never provides a motive to his actions.  Some reviews have suggested that he is a crook out to recover some old loot while others have proposed that the father tries to teach his two sons to become men, as their upbringing has lacked a male role model.  It does not really matter what the audience thinks, as all ideas can be true.  What seems to matter is the father's inability to communicate with his two sons, as he often leaves them confused, hurt, and withdrawn.Cleverly, Zvyagintsev uses the mise-en-scene in the film, which helps create the tentative milieu.  The many majestic shots expand the viewer's mind in several directions, as they provide the audience an opportunity to ponder the insignificance of the character's identity.  This enhances the ominous tension shaped between the children and the father, which might lead the audience's mind in a negative and darker direction of the father's intentions.  The camera filter also plays an important role in producing a negative atmosphere, as it boosts the emotional distance between the father and the boys.The highly speculative atmosphere that Andrei Zvyagintsev generates through his film suggests the notion of poor communication and highlights the importance of good communication.  Communication is also an essential part of cinema, as cinema is visual storytelling that can use dialogue and other auditory signals to promote a story.  Regardless of the story's outcome, the audience learns a threefold lesson through the film about the importance of language and communication.  The most obvious lesson is in regards to the boys' confusion and pain in the story due to the father's poor communication.  The second lesson that Zvyagintsev teaches the audience is through the viewer's own assumptions and guesses based on the lack of information.  The final lesson of communication that the film provides is in regards to our short existence on earth, which suggests that one should seize the day when the chance presents itself.  Ultimately, the audience can reflect over the pictures at the end in the film, as these images provide several different ideas.  This is the beauty of art, as it leaves the audience with their own interpretations and thoughts, which maybe could lead to a revelation of some sort helping people with proper communication.",5,Brilliantly Speculative Cinema of Father's Return...,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,4517,"['Communication', 'people', 'closer', 'shared', 'information', 'obstacles', 'such', 'guessing', 'assumptions', 'example', 'person', 'am', 'scared', 'People', 'know', 'person', 'scared', 'opportunity', 'people', 'help', 'person', 'fear', 'one', 'way', 'Thus', 'communication', 'also', 'foundation', 'education', 'enlightenment', 'rest', 'communication', 'perished', 'enlightenment', 'knowledge', 'would', 'see', 'final', 'days', 'next', 'generation', 'would', 'never', 'receive', 'information', 'previous', 'generations', 'why', 'communication', 'why', 'language', 'so', 'essential', 'human', 'existence', 'Return', 'returning', 'father', 'inability', 'communicate', 'will', 'leave', 'audience', 'cerebral', 'man', 'land', 'guessing', 'concocting', 'own', 'assumptions.The', 'director', 'Andrei', 'Zvyagintsev', 'film', 'pier', 'where', 'large', 'diving', 'tower', 'located', 'young', 'teenagers', 'are', 'jumping', 'tower', 'Ivan', 'Ivan', 'Dobronravov', 'one', 'younger', 'kids', 'not', 'jump', 'fears', 'height', 'friends', 'older', 'brother', 'Andrey', 'Vladimir', 'Garin', 'leave', 'top', 'diving', 'tower', 'whimpering', 'fear', 'cold', 'sea', 'breeze', 'body', 'situation', 'where', 'Ivan', 'friends', 'call', 'coward', 'Ivan', 'up', 'fight', 'brother', 'home', 'tell', 'mother', 'simply', 'Do', ""n't"", 'wake', 'father', 'Flabbergasted', 'two', 'boys', 'look', 'mother', 'when', 'father', 'Konstantin', 'Lavronenko', 'home', 'two', 'boys', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'father', 'decade', 'now', 'returned', 'reason', 'first', 'thing', 'father', 'decided', 'do', 'take', 'two', 'boys', 'fishing', 'trip', 'however', 'trip', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'what', 'kids', 'had', 'trip', 'father', 'abusive', 'rough', 'Ivan', 'Andrey', 'However', 'audience', 'follow', 'trail', 'suggestive', 'ideas', 'viewer', 'mere', 'assumptions', 'Several', 'reviews', 'have', 'pinpointed', 'speculative', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'father', 'film', 'persona', 'never', 'motive', 'actions', 'reviews', 'have', 'suggested', 'crook', 'out', 'recover', 'old', 'loot', 'others', 'have', 'proposed', 'father', 'teach', 'two', 'sons', 'become', 'men', 'upbringing', 'lacked', 'male', 'role', 'model', 'not', 'really', 'matter', 'what', 'audience', 'ideas', 'can', 'be', 'true', 'What', 'matter', 'father', 'inability', 'communicate', 'two', 'sons', 'often', 'confused', 'hurt', 'withdrawn.Cleverly', 'Zvyagintsev', 'mise-en-scene', 'film', 'create', 'tentative', 'milieu', 'many', 'majestic', 'shots', 'expand', 'viewer', 'mind', 'several', 'directions', 'provide', 'audience', 'opportunity', 'ponder', 'insignificance', 'character', 'identity', 'ominous', 'tension', 'shaped', 'children', 'father', 'might', 'lead', 'audience', 'mind', 'negative', 'darker', 'direction', 'father', 'intentions', 'camera', 'filter', 'also', 'important', 'role', 'producing', 'negative', 'atmosphere', 'emotional', 'distance', 'father', 'boys.The', 'highly', 'speculative', 'atmosphere', 'Andrei', 'Zvyagintsev', 'film', 'notion', 'poor', 'communication', 'highlights', 'importance', 'good', 'communication', 'Communication', 'also', 'essential', 'part', 'cinema', 'cinema', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'can', 'use', 'dialogue', 'other', 'auditory', 'signals', 'promote', 'story', 'Regardless', 'story', 'outcome', 'audience', 'threefold', 'lesson', 'film', 'importance', 'language', 'communication', 'most', 'obvious', 'lesson', 'regards', 'boys', 'confusion', 'pain', 'story', 'due', 'father', 'poor', 'communication', 'second', 'lesson', 'Zvyagintsev', 'audience', 'viewer', 'own', 'assumptions', 'guesses', 'based', 'lack', 'information', 'final', 'lesson', 'communication', 'film', 'regards', 'short', 'existence', 'earth', 'one', 'should', 'seize', 'day', 'when', 'chance', 'Ultimately', 'audience', 'can', 'reflect', 'pictures', 'end', 'film', 'images', 'provide', 'several', 'different', 'ideas', 'beauty', 'art', 'audience', 'own', 'interpretations', 'thoughts', 'maybe', 'could', 'lead', 'revelation', 'sort', 'helping', 'people', 'proper', 'communication']",The Return

The story is moving, believable and deep on both psychological and emotional levels -- the cinematography, writing and pacing are right on target -- and the acting is as close to perfect as either a director OR audience can imagine.Konstantin Lavronenko plays the long-lost father with just the right mix of strength, mystery and cool understatement -- his character would give many actors an excuse to overplay and draw attention away from the young men portraying the sons, the true centers of the film.  The balance he achieves here is a tribute to the care with which he pursues his craft.The two young actors who play brothers Andrey and Ivan (Vladimir Garin and Ivan Dobronravov, respectively) turn in some of the most believable, moving performances I've ever seen from people their age.  The depths of emotion and commitment they give to their roles is extraordinary -- it's a level of quality that is a joy to see in actors of ANY age, but to see it in these who are so young is incredible.The fact that this is director Zvyagintsev's first feature film tells me that this is indeed a filmmaker to watch -- and I don't think a film of this quality can be written off as 'beginner's luck'.  His talent is formidable -- I look forward to seeing more from him.The story unfolds at just the right pace -- the audience is given no clues as to what will happen next, and is kept is just as much suspense as the characters in the film.  The honors this film received at the Venice Film Festival were justified -- I can recommend it without reservation to anyone, whether they favor 'art house' cinema or simply a well-made film telling a compelling story.Additionally -- it's nice to see Kino expanding the scope of their 'special features' on this DVD.  They've released a good number of quality films, but the 'extras' on the ones I've seen have been a little thin.

Since the boys, Ivan and Andrei, are so young, they have no independant memory of him and are forced to run to a secret hiding place where they have ferreted away a photograph of him. Both nod affirmatively: 'It's him.'One of our weaknesses as Americans, whether we travel to foreign countries or read foreign books or see foreign movies, is that we expect to see the USA in a foreign tongue. When we don't, we criticise the effort because in our minds, it doesn't measure up. 'It just ain't normal, Gladys!'So one thing this film isn't is that it isn't American. We don't know what the father was up to. We don't know why he came back.

The film is emotional, intense, mysterious, minimalistic, and filmed with grayish hues to set a mood of impending questions from the beginning. Two young brothers come home to discover that their estranged father of twelve years is back. They are a bit perturbed and must confirm the reality of what's going on by looking at an old black and white photo taken many years ago to make sure there is a physical resemblance.The father is a man of few words and intense sad eyes. He decides to take them on a trip to go fishing and camping. During this venture as the plot unravels we discover that this strange man is mean to both his sons. The older boy Andrey, wants his father's love and approval and overlooks the abuse, but the younger Ivan does not and is outspoken about it. The tension in the film keeps building since you have no clue what the father's intentions are and you often wonder why he even came back in the first place.The young Ivan acts out towards his father and he is actually abandoned on a highway for many hours in heavy rain. Once the father felt Ivan had learned his lesson he goes, back to pick him up and they are stuck in the mud. While trying to drag the car out, the father bashes Andrey's face against the car giving him a bloody nose. After that incident, the quick-tempered Ivan questions if this man is even his father and contemplates stabbing him if he comes near him or tries to hurt him. He confides all this to his older brother, but Andrey being in denial just thinks Ivan is perhaps a bit paranoid.They go to a shoreline, build a boat, and go off to a remote island. Events begin to get a little weird, the boys are always hungry, and father doesn't pay much attention to that matter and keeps disappearing. At one point, the father is found digging to what looks to be a grave, and digs out a little wooden box that we never find out what's in it.

838921,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0002KQOH6,Lee Armstrong,"[8, 29]","""The Return"" is a tediously slow epic whose lack of plot detail is apparently being received as profundity.  There are some excellent performances in the small cast.  Ivan Dobronravov in his first picture plays Ivan the younger son who rejects and is suspicious of his father.  The one scene on the beach where he tells his father that he wants to love him and then tears off in the opposite direction is enough to rip your heart out & hand it to you on a platter.  The older brother Andrei played by Vladimir Garin does an excellent job as well.  Perhaps in Russia people have more time to take or life seems more relaxed.  Director Andrei Zvyagintsev takes a very long time to communicate very little.  The father is absent for 12 years and returns with no apparent explanation by the mother other than, ""He's back.""  The boys think he was a pilot, but why didn't he ever come home?  The subsequent clandestine trip with the boys leads one to believe that the father was a criminal, but why take the boys on this trip?  Apparently, the brusque father who can abandon a son on a bridge to suffer a drenching rainstorm does also love the boy as he shouts ""Vanya"" as he tries to scramble to save the boy.  Natalya Vdovina as the mother seems alternately maternal and sleazy.  One wonders why she'd allow a husband gone for 12 years to suddenly take the boys out on a trip without her.  In the end, as the dysfunctional family collapses, I wondered why so little care is given to these young sons.  Perhaps like an epic beer commercial, why ask why.  The answers are not given and the questions are less than profound.  The DVD offers almost no extras.  So if you're a very patient viewer or one whose life is going so fast that you're looking for a way to slow down, this is the film that will do it for you.  While some were greatly moved by this film, I was utterly bored.

It worked firstly as a mysterious, psychological drama, but once the film had ended, it fit the definition of the term allegory perfectly.""The Return"" makes a compelling case in favor of a poetically complex narrative over the expectations of 'The Hollywood Ending', where life eventually makes some kind of sense. The absence of a father can create a psychological 'presence' for the family, both seen and felt in the emotional interaction of the children. This complex, yet all too human condition is played out here, not as a narrative sleight of hand (The Sixth Sense) but rather as film poetry. Life's hardest truths sit like a stone in the mouth and won't be broken down easily. The characters in this film seem to be struggling with the absence of their father or husband, but doing so with him present.Visual cues which seem to lead to a metaphorical reading of what's happening are scattered throughout the film. For example, when the the boys see their sleeping father for the first time, he's viewed as Andrea Mantegna's ""Dead Christ"". The boys dash upstairs immediately afterwords to see if he looks like their father from an old photo, loosely placed in an old book of engravings - on the page where the angel stays Abraham's hand before he sacrifices his son. Then there is the repeated image of the tower, seeming to both foreshadow and justify a fear of death for the youngest brother. And the mysterious journey to an island, the significance of which changes them all. These don't appear as kitsch cues (as in, ""this image stands for this specific idea."") but appear as symbols whose meaning is more poetic than literal. They're tied to the story and can't be extracted cleanly. In true Tarkovskian form the filmmaker has bled his symbols of specific reference and made them about the characters.And there's the profoundly enigmatic manner of the father, existing for the two brothers in terms of curt preoccupation, edicts, veiled threats, detachment and blunt instruction. He could very well not be there. This causes both boys to respond to him with a mix of outrage, incredulity and bitterness.Its a rare film, well worth seeing, if for no other reason than to marvel at the elegiac force of the story, the photography and at the performances that the director managed to coax from his actors.

This is a mesmerizing study of the heartache that fathers and sons experience from enforced separation and how hard it can be to reunite.People who find this boring have no real appreciation for deep and quiet probing of the human soul, and for the gradual but all the more excruciating buildup of tension that great art like this portrays. The film made me think of Hemingway, particularly his Nick Adams stories, about how boys grow into men in the wilderness,and how manhood itself can become a kind of emotional wildneress of its own.For those who are perplexed about what's going on with the father, here's what the story line hints at pretty clearly:  the father was a convicted criminal, probably a smuggler and black marketeer, and has recently been  released from prison. He takes he boys to an island in the Gulf of Finland to recover a treasure he buried there before he was caught. It may be gold, or cash or jewelry or drugs, but it's valuable.  But the story is presented from his young teenaged sons' point of view, and we only see what they see.

838945,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0002KQOH6,Roland E. Zwick,"[86, 98]","""The Return,"" a breathtakingly austere masterpiece from the land that gave us Eisenstein, Pudovkin and Tarkovsky, is one of the most beautifully acted and directed films I have seen in years.  Astonishingly enough, this is the feature film debut for director Andrei Zvyagintsev who demonstrates more of a mastery and command of the medium in this his maiden effort than most directors do in a whole body of work.The film tells the tale of two brothers, Ivan and Andrei, who live with their mother and grandmother in a small coastal village in Russia.  One day, totally unexpectedly, the boys' father returns after a twelve-year absence.  In an effort to make up for lost time, the dad decides to take his sons on a fishing trip, but, almost immediately, he begins to demonstrate disturbing tendencies towards domination and abuse.  He also appears to be up to some sort of nefarious business operations to which neither we nor the boys are entirely privy.Every single moment of this film is a revelation.  Zvyagintsev beautifully captures the opposite ways in which the boys react to and interact with their father.  Andrei, the oldest, is so desperate for a father figure in his life that he is willing to overlook the often inexplicable, bizarre and possibly even dangerous behavior that this particular father exhibits.  Ivan, on the other hand, embittered by years of absence and neglect, seethes with barely disguised rage at the man who now presumes to enter into their once happy lives and assert his authority.  Of the two boys, he seems the most tuned into the kind of threat the father may pose to their welfare.  Yet, towards the end of the story, the apparently latent love the boy feels for this man as his father does eventually rise to the surface.  Through this intense interaction, the film emerges as a complex and profound study of what father and son relationships are really all about.It is virtually impossible to put into words just how brilliantly the two young actors use their facial expressions to convey a wealth of meaning and emotion.  As portrayed by Vladimir Garin, Andrey looks up to his father with a mixture of boyish pride and trembling awe, longing for the kind of male affirmation he has been deprived of all these years.  He is desperate to please his father by proving to him that he can perform the acts of manhood that his dad keeps putting forth for him to do.  As Ivan, Ivan Dobronravov spends most of his time glaring at the man, his mouth pursed in a tight unyielding grimace of resentment and hate.  If I could give an award for the best performance by a child actor in movie history, these two youngsters would be high on my list of candidates.  They are that amazing.  Tragically, young Garin drowned two months prior to the release of the film, leaving his indelible mark behind in a performance that will never be forgotten by anyone privileged enough to witness it.  Konstantin Lavronenko is equally impressive as the boy's mysterious father, beautifully underplaying the part of a man who can appear sane and rational on the surface but who is a seething cauldron of untapped emotions beneath.  In fact, it is this constant threat of violence always on the verge of eruption that keeps us off balance and on edge throughout the entire picture.The film's writers, Vladimir Moiseyenko and Aleksandr Novotosky, deserve special recognition for not allowing the plot to overwhelm the characters.  For this is, first and foremost, a great character study.  The scenarists have intentionally left the background of the father vague and sketchy, the better to enhance the sense of mystery and danger he represents.  We never find out what nefarious activities he is involved with since that is of virtually no importance either to the children or to us.  We are too engrossed in the relationships of the characters to care.  In fact, there are a few hints towards the end of the film that this seemingly cold, uncaring man, for all his myriad faults, might actually just love his sons in his own strange way.  The film leaves us with no easy answers or pat resolutions at the end.  And this is how it should be.  In fact, the scriptwriters even throw a few of Hitchcock's prized ""MacGuffins"" into the mix to keep us off balance (there is a scene in which some possibly stolen money sinks to the bottom of a lake that is highly reminiscent of what happens in ""Psycho"")..Among other things, ""The Return"" represents one of the most impressive directorial debuts since Francois Truffaut`s ""The 400 Blows.""  Zvyagintsev's ability to draw great performances from his actors is only one of his many talents on display here.  His lyrical use of composition, as well as the way in which he makes nature and weather an integral part of his drama help to draw us so deeply into this world that it takes the viewer literally hours to get fully back to his own existence again once the movie has ended.  It reverberates for days afterwards.  For as with any great film, ""The Return"" finds its way into the depths of one's soul and leaves the viewer a richer person for the experience.Winner of the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival (2003), ""The Return"" is a true work of art and one of the outstanding films of the decade so far.

838947,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B0002KQOH6,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[14, 15]","Imagine Bergman with a touch of Hitchcock or Chabrol. In this award-winning film about a father and two young sons on a fishing trip after twelve years of separation, there is the bleakness and moral ambiguity of Bergman's world, where people live isolated lives, often on remote islands. Meanwhile, there's the creepy uncertainty that permeates the works of the masters of suspense. In its stark focus on three characters traveling alone together, it's also reminiscent of Polanski's early film, ""Knife in the Water.""Visually the film is striking with its slow but persistent camera movement and the washed out color that reduces some scenes to monochrome. Meanwhile, the soundtrack music is spare and eerie. Most striking of all are the performances, as the taciturn and vaguely malevolent father interacts in unexpected ways with the two boys, who regard him with varying degrees of trust and distrust.At some level, it's a film about fathers and sons and the distance between them as the immaturity, emotions, fears and physical weakness of boys are confronted by the uncompromising expectations of hardened adult males, who have shed any vestige of their own boyhoods as something to be scorned. And we keep watching the man for signs of his true character as he responds to the two boys, one of them willing to accept the man at his word, the other deeply suspicious and openly rebellious.Based on a simple premise, it's a brilliantly conceived story that holds the viewer to the end, leaving us finally with unanswered questions that provoke reflection on the loss of innocence and the uneasy relationship between family and self. The DVD includes a one-hour making-of documentary that reveals many of the challenges of directing and shooting the film.

Ivan and Andrei are typical siblings, always fighting with each other and trying to outrun each other. One day they come back home squabbling as usual only to find their mother hush them up. The reason: their father who has been gone many years has suddenly come back and is sleeping inside. The kids are confused, delighted and suspicious all at the same time. The Father offers to take the kids for a 3 day fishing trip. Andrei, the elder son wants to gel with his father and follows him everywhere. Ivan, the younger son is a little held back and suspicious.Father's behavior with his kids fluctuates between the caring to the harsh, but mostly harsh. On one occasion he abandons Ivan on the road and in freezing rain only to pick him up later. At times, he ensures that the kids are wearing jackets for the nippy evening. On the second day they paddle to a desolate island in near blizzard like conditions and camp in the open. Things just get bad on the island and a sudden tragic accident happens. The events thereafter have been directed brilliantly. The emotional swings are very natural and the bleak natural surroundings just add to them.

Ivan wimps out and gets in a fight with his brother who joins their friends in mocking his cowardice. Then they go home to a bombshell. Their father is there. He hasn't been seen for 12 years and has inexplicably returned. What is more he is going to take them on a trip in his car. It's not clear quite where but fishing will, it seems, be involved. Off they go but it soon becomes clear the father-son bonding isn't really working out, especially with Ivan who is increasingly hostile and rebellious, insisting to his brother that there is something sinister and dangerous about this man. At times indeed it seems he might be right: we know nothing about this man, not even his name, never mind the identity of the person he `phones from the caf&eacute; or the contents of the strange box he digs up. At other times, it merely seems this is a fairly well-intentioned but awkward man with little understanding of how effectively to engage with young boys. In any case we observe rising tensions and a steadily growing sense of dread until the shocking climax where - well, I'm not such a dreadful spoilsport that I'm going to tell you.This is youthful director Andrei Zvyganitzev's first movie. Cinematographer Mikhail Krichman, writers Vladimir Moiseyenko and Aleksandr Novototsky and composer Andrei Dergachyov are all also pretty new to the game. All five of them look like pretty good news for Russian cinema. Made for a tiny budget, this is a breathtakingly good movie: deep and beautiful and utterly unforgettable. Krichman's photography is phenomenal. The acting from the three leads, Konstantin Lavronenko as the taciturn and ambivalent father, and the two neophyte child actors Ivan Dobronravov as the petulant younger brother Ivan and Vladimir Garin as Andrei is consistently astonishing. (Heartbreakingly, Garin died in a swimming accident before the film was released.) It's full of scenes that could not be more perfectly realized. One that stands out for me is where Ivan, after a fight with his dad, is briefly abandoned alone on a bridge over a river. He sees a lorry approaching in the distances. It reaches him and drives past. That's all but,...wow. I grant you it certainly doesn't sound very exciting. But then neither does Omar Sharif appearing in the distance and slowly approaching Peter O'Toole across the sand sound very exciting to people who haven't seen `Lawrence of Arabia.'

It is cold and the drop is quite a large one, presenting them with yet another danger to defeat. Two of these boys are brothers: the teenage Andrei (Vladimir Garin) and the younger Vanya (Ivan Dobronravov). One by one they begin to jump off the top and into the depths of the water, leaving young Vanya curled up in a ball, crying at the thought of descending from such a height. The rest of the boys later learn he never jumped after leaving him there, nearly scared for his life. They call him a pig, a coward, and even his brother joins in the criticism, till the two begin to beat each other up, chasing each other back to their house where their mother stands on an empty porch, smoking, looking into the distance: ""Don't wake your father.""The boys' father (Konstantin Lavronenko) has been gone for 12 years. During that period of time, the brothers became close, bonding emotionally (as revealed in the first few scenes afore mentioned), and adjusted to life without a father they knew existed and thrived elsewhere. Now, they come to dinner to find him pouring wine for his wife and mother-in-law. He is commanding, stern, stoic: it seems as if he is incapable of expressing emotion, fascinating Andrei and Vanya nonetheless. Their hesitant mother sends the boys with their newly arrived father on what is believed to be a fishing trip, but is exhibited to be something more intriguing, an idea that unfortunately is never fully developed (any attempts to shape the father's other intentions on this trip are often confused and unfocused).What remains strong throughout is the film's use of metaphor. The story turns into that of a road trip, the father teaching his boys life lessons along the way. He maintains his stern disposition even when he inflicts both physical and emotional hardship upon his sons, both of whom barely know him, in turn taking mere slaps and yells deep to heart, judging his every action. This situation progressively begins to reek of societal and political comparisons. Luckily, the film never reaches that level of didacticism which limits one's room for interpretation. In addition, the intense human emotions demonstrated in the central relationship remain palpable, despite 'The Return' being obviously allegorical.Much of this emotion is well maintained as a result of strong acting. Lavronenko's father is always nuanced with near-tearful eyes or looks of worry and of pain revealing his deep longing for his sons' affections. Garin's Andrei is perfectly naive, balancing his character's symbolic and human natures. However, it is perhaps Ivan Dobronravov's Vanya that most affected me.Recently, critics and movie-goers have acclaimed little Freddie Highmore's performance in 'Finding Neverland' as masterful. Though I loved Highmore's work, there is no doubt the also quite young Dobronravov does all Highmore did in 'Neverland' and then some. I was impressed with his ability to completely draw me into his character's feelings, never black-and-white, but honest. There is a scene where he's atop yet another tower --for reasons I will not mention, as not to ruin the film for you-- and he whispers hurtful words to himself, and I sat in my bed in complete emotional shock. Coming out of Dobronravov's mouth, these words were meaningful and dug deep within my heart, as I was able to witness the dimensions in them unfolding, one after the other. This occurs before a drastic, but completely necessary and well-handled twist in the story. As a result of Dobronravov's acting, the final third of the film carries an emotional weight on its back that serves both the film's metaphor and its human message well, elevating 'The Return' to a level you did not see approaching. I applaud this child's performance, and it will undoubtedly end up on my short list for the year's best lead acting performances. Not since Haley Joel Osment in 'The Sixth Sense' have I been this impressed, this moved by a child actor (sorry, Keisha Castle-Hughes).I urge you to see this movie. Sure, at times it may be a bit slow-moving, but a performance by a child this dimensional, cinematography this gorgeous, a metaphor this well presented: it's all so rare, I cannot help but strongly admire director Andrei Zvyagintsev for giving us a film strong at its core, if not polished on its surface.",4,"Great debut.
