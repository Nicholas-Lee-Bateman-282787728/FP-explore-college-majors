Dana Brown uses his father's film format, that worked well with films such as ""On Any Sunday"" and ""The Endless Summer"". In a sense, ""Dust To Glory"" is an extension of ""On Any Sunday"".It shows the personal battles of each team, racing against the clock to win. There are a number of crashes, breakdowns, and much humor, to keep you occupied. Each of the ""Major"" teams are showcased, and you are kept abreast of all changes that take place during the race. The number of ""mechanical oddities"" abound in this film, and Class 11, or the VW Bug class, is given some time. you gotta hand it to these VW Bug drivers, THEY'RE CRAZY!!This race was almost consigned to oblivion back in the 80's, because there were a rash of deaths associated with crashes that were purposely caused by Mexican locals, for their trucks and buggies, so they could be sold. Apparently, this practice has been stopped, because the Baja 1000 brings in much-needed American dollars into the Mexican economy.There are some well-known racers showcased, as well. Mario Andretti, Robby Gordon, Johnny Campbell and a returning J.N. Roberts (he was in the original ""On Any Sunday"").""Dust To Glory"" is an entertaining look at a classic American race that has gone on, despite it's ""infamous"" reputation, to attract racers from all disciplines.

916457,A11VIKSJ5L4MC4,B0009XT8C4,Marvelous,"[1, 1]","One thing is certain in Baja, and that is that nothing is certain. This movie was beautifully filmed, showing some truly mystical moments that one would experience in the race of all races. The only reason why I gave this film a 4 star rating instead of 5, is because I felt the director spent a little too much time following the motorcycles, and not enough time displaying all which trophy trucks go through. I love all the classes of Baja; I don't think I'm alone on this when saying that Trophy trucks are the climax of the racing day.So I was somewhat dissapointed when I realized I was only given maybe a solid 15 mins of trophy truck time, but nonetheless I still enjoyed watching this movie very much. For some time now, I've kept telling people that I want to race in the Baja 1000 one day, and all I get is negative feedback, on what a challenge it is, or how expensive a race it is to compete in. But I don't want to let that stop me, these great racers made it, so why can't I??? This movie made me internalize my feelings towards Baja even more, the landscaping is so beautiful at times with the trucks roaring through, that I felt tear jerking moments of happiness.This movie really shows what kind of experience it really is, and it made me want to push to make it there myself!

916460,A3BU2L8HG87XK1,B0009XT8C4,S. Lewis,"[0, 0]","I'm an avid off-road motorcyclist, and heard the hype about this movie for months before it was released. As soon as it was available on DVD I purchased it without hesitation.Turns out it has the feel of a 'discovery channel' documentary to the whole movie, which is ok I guess, but I was expecting a lot more 1st person camera footage (from the bike during the race). Most of the time was devoted to the Honda XR650R motorcycle racers, but a fair amount of coverage was given to Robby Gordon (not sure why, I think he takes away from anything on TV anywhere). I like watching almost any kind of vehicle race off-road, and I must say there was a good mix between the bikes and trucks.Overall it was a good movie, great if you consider how rarely we get a movie promoting off-road racing. There are some really awesome camera shots spread throughout the movie, some from helicopter and some from cameramen on bikes, I've gotta say those shots were breathtaking, but they didn't last very long and left me wanting more. I'm glad to see Baja finally get a good movie, but as with a lot of documentary type shows, it drops the ball and focuses a bit too much on non-race people and 'sideshow' happenings along the way. You get to meet people you could care less about, crazy drunks, orphans, etc all through the movie. You feel like they're trying to build up all these relationships with the audience, maybe even trying to get you to root for certain participants instead of just focusing on the race action like we're interested in. If you know how exciting an off-road race actually is, you will be dissappointed at certain points by the constant jumping away from the action. I think it veered away from the hard core race action to get the movie to appeal to more 'non-racer' types and/or women (lets face it, this is definitely a guy movie!).Overall, I would recommend to any off-roader, but I'm holding out on that 5th star for the next movie!",4,Good movie about a race that rarely gets any credit,1127952000,"09 29, 2005",2005,1946,"[""'m"", 'avid', 'off-road', 'motorcyclist', 'heard', 'hype', 'movie', 'months', 'was', 'released', 'As', 'soon', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'out', 'feel', ""'discovery"", 'channel', 'documentary', 'whole', 'movie', 'ok', 'guess', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'more', '1st', 'person', 'camera', 'footage', 'bike', 'race', 'Most', 'time', 'was', 'devoted', 'Honda', 'XR650R', 'motorcycle', 'racers', 'fair', 'amount', 'coverage', 'was', 'given', 'Robby', 'Gordon', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'think', 'away', 'anything', 'TV', 'anywhere', 'watching', 'almost', 'kind', 'vehicle', 'race', 'off-road', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'good', 'mix', 'bikes', 'trucks.Overall', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'consider', 'how', 'rarely', 'get', 'movie', 'promoting', 'off-road', 'racing', 'are', 'really', 'awesome', 'camera', 'shots', 'spread', 'movie', 'helicopter', 'cameramen', 'bikes', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'shots', 'were', 'breathtaking', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'very', 'long', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'Baja', 'finally', 'get', 'good', 'movie', 'lot', 'documentary', 'type', 'shows', 'ball', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'non-race', 'people', ""'sideshow"", 'happenings', 'way', 'get', 'meet', 'people', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'crazy', 'drunks', 'orphans', 'etc', 'movie', 'feel', ""'re"", 'trying', 'build', 'up', 'relationships', 'audience', 'maybe', 'even', 'trying', 'get', 'root', 'certain', 'participants', 'instead', 'just', 'focusing', 'race', 'action', ""'re"", 'interested', 'know', 'how', 'exciting', 'off-road', 'race', 'actually', 'will', 'be', 'dissappointed', 'certain', 'points', 'constant', 'jumping', 'away', 'action', 'think', 'veered', 'away', 'hard', 'core', 'race', 'action', 'get', 'movie', 'appeal', 'more', ""'non-racer"", 'types', 'women', 'lets', 'face', 'definitely', 'guy', 'movie', '.Overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'off-roader', ""'m"", 'holding', 'out', '5th', 'star', 'next', 'movie']",Dust to Glory
