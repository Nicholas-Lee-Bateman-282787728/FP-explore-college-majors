Their aren't as many fight scenes as the cover suggests, but they are all well done and the action flows unlike some anime with the movements are stiff and rigid. It's also a great anime for someone who really enjoys a historical/mythological Japanese feel as the story revolves around a boy (the emperor's son) possessed by the egg of a benevolent water spirit.I love the series!The music,the caracters specialy Balsa,she's great!!.Is a good quality dvd and a good price.I hope they do the next book in anime!!.Thank you.

1326871,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B0035RWG0M,Coulter Rail,"[1, 6]","Let's get to it:***PROS***ORIGINALITY is the identifier for this show. There are no winking pixies, sons of Dracula, or robotic sky scrapers dueling (not that there's anything wrong with those AT ALL). They design a pleasing, realistic world with many unique rituals and mysteries to unravel (slowly). The characters are not regurgitated from popular anime, although what looks deep on the surface is regrettably a kiddie pool (aside from the prince who's got a whole ocean in his belly).ANIMATION, ANIMATION, ANIMATION is gorgeous. Character designs, while not screamingly original, are smartly done. The action (when it happens) is reminiscent of Aniplex and Studio Bones gems like FMA: Brotherhood and Sword of the Stranger. There are no flame swords or lightning orbs, so the fights consist of actual martial arts choreography. It's refreshing as hell.***CONS***AUDIENCE CONFUSION. I'm not sure what age group they were aiming for. The story is not intricate or intellectually stimulating enough for adults, not risqu&eacute;/edgy or bold enough for teens, and yet there's not enough action or flashing colors for kids. I've seen slow period pieces and understand the allure, but this is a made-up period; they didn't spend sufficient time explaining the wonderful world they've created, nor did they go deep enough to make me appreciate it.PACING was the nail in the coffin for this show. 26 episodes? This would have been better as a film or six-episode one-shot. I understand and appreciate the water prince and his journey to become a real human being. I also understand having the audience live among the main characters to breathe in their day-to-day life lessons; I understand the down-time that comes with hiding out and learning the value of being a dull peasant. After four episodes of that, though, I'm good. What, more? Five? Six!? Make it rain already, kid. Let's fight some monster crabs and be done with it.MUSIC. The music for the actual show is fine. It's no Hans Zimmer score, but it works well. I list the music among the cons only to take a massive dump on the opening title song. If you liked the song, power to ya.  When I first heard it, I laughed out loud. The second time I heard it, I looked around, embarrassed that someone would see me listening to it. I'm now fighting for the rights of the series: Do not judge the series on the opening credits or you will launch the DVD case through your new flatscreen. What an unfair and tragic thing to behold before asking an audience to take your show seriously.All in all, this piece has its charms. I love long drawn-out period pieces, but this truly tried my affection for them. After two hours, I was desperately looking for an explosion of character development (or even a real explosion, for that matter). This show DOES deserve a following and fans . . . it's just not going to be me. A great effort that quickly turned into a trial of patience.I really love anime when it works. I'm an animator and writer myself, so I'm always pouring through the stacks looking for gems. I'll be doing a lot more reviews. If you find that these are helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along. I'll try not to steer you into s***.",2,Guardian of This Kid for WAY TOO LONG,1378598400,"09 8, 2013",2013,3203,"['Let', 'get', '***PROS***ORIGINALITY', 'identifier', 'show', 'are', 'winking', 'pixies', 'sons', 'Dracula', 'robotic', 'sky', 'scrapers', 'dueling', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'AT', 'ALL', 'design', 'pleasing', 'realistic', 'world', 'many', 'unique', 'rituals', 'mysteries', 'unravel', 'slowly', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'regurgitated', 'popular', 'anime', 'what', 'deep', 'surface', 'regrettably', 'kiddie', 'pool', 'aside', 'prince', 'who', 'got', 'whole', 'ocean', 'belly', '.ANIMATION', 'ANIMATION', 'ANIMATION', 'gorgeous', 'Character', 'designs', 'not', 'screamingly', 'original', 'are', 'smartly', 'done', 'action', 'when', 'reminiscent', 'Aniplex', 'Studio', 'Bones', 'gems', 'FMA', 'Brotherhood', 'Sword', 'Stranger', 'are', 'flame', 'swords', 'lightning', 'orbs', 'fights', 'consist', 'actual', 'martial', 'arts', 'choreography', 'refreshing', 'as', 'hell', '***CONS***AUDIENCE', 'CONFUSION', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'age', 'group', 'were', 'aiming', 'story', 'not', 'intricate', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'enough', 'adults', 'not', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'bold', 'enough', 'teens', 'yet', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'flashing', 'colors', 'kids', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'slow', 'period', 'pieces', 'understand', 'allure', 'made-up', 'period', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'sufficient', 'time', 'explaining', 'wonderful', 'world', ""'ve"", 'created', 'did', 'go', 'deep', 'enough', 'make', 'appreciate', 'it.PACING', 'was', 'nail', 'coffin', 'show', '26', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'six-episode', 'one-shot', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'water', 'prince', 'journey', 'become', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'also', 'understand', 'having', 'audience', 'live', 'main', 'characters', 'breathe', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'lessons', 'understand', 'down-time', 'hiding', 'out', 'learning', 'value', 'being', 'dull', 'peasant', 'four', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'good', 'What', 'more', 'Five', 'Six', 'Make', 'rain', 'already', 'kid', 'Let', 'fight', 'monster', 'crabs', 'be', 'done', 'it.MUSIC', 'music', 'actual', 'show', 'fine', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'well', 'list', 'music', 'cons', 'only', 'take', 'massive', 'dump', 'opening', 'title', 'song', 'liked', 'song', 'power', 'ya', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'second', 'time', 'heard', 'looked', 'around', 'embarrassed', 'someone', 'would', 'see', 'listening', ""'m"", 'now', 'fighting', 'rights', 'series', 'Do', 'not', 'judge', 'series', 'opening', 'credits', 'will', 'launch', 'DVD', 'case', 'new', 'flatscreen', 'What', 'unfair', 'tragic', 'thing', 'behold', 'asking', 'audience', 'take', 'show', 'seriously.All', 'piece', 'charms', 'love', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'period', 'pieces', 'truly', 'tried', 'affection', 'two', 'hours', 'was', 'desperately', 'looking', 'explosion', 'character', 'development', 'even', 'real', 'explosion', 'matter', 'show', 'DOES', 'deserve', 'following', 'fans', 'just', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'effort', 'quickly', 'turned', 'trial', 'patience.I', 'really', 'love', 'anime', 'when', ""'m"", 'animator', 'writer', ""'m"", 'always', 'pouring', 'stacks', 'looking', 'gems', ""'ll"", 'be', 'doing', 'lot', 'more', 'reviews', 'find', 'are', 'helpful', 'tastes', 'seem', 'align', 'follow', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'steer', 's***']",Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit - Complete Collection

1326873,A2VSVAOPHCB3KS,B0035RWG0M,"Edward Swing ""blackdaggr""","[3, 3]","Moribito is a fantasy story where a female bodyguard, Balsa, accepts a job guarding a boy prince. The prince has been possessed by a water spirit/demon, so his father tries to have him killed. During the time they spend together, Balsa begins to care for the boy, and the young prince grows into a young man.Other people have already provided more details on the rich plot, so I will not reiterate. However, I do want to point out some of the elements of the story that I really enjoyed. First, I was particularly impressed by the visual detail in the setting. The backgrounds were beautifully rendered, and the city settings are very rich. You really feel like this is in a real place. The food is rendered in such detail that it almost makes you hungry. EVen the visual details of the water mill and the storehouse in Hunter's Hole are well done. It almost made me buy this series again on Blu-Ray.In addition to the visuals, the setting detail is extremely well-done. There is a lot of background information about how the people live, from the workings of the aforementioned water mill, how Balsa and company prepare for winter in Hunter's Hole, and how the blacksmith forges swords. Very nicely done. You could show this series to a history class.I also really enjoyed the characters. None of the characters are two-dimensional. Balsa and Prince Chagum are well-developed, and carry the story well. Tanda, Balsa's herbalist friend also provides a good strong character without being a combat monster. But even the antagonists are detailed. The elite royal guards aren't just a bunch of skilled fighters - they demonstrate loyalty, dedication, and ingenuity. Seeing them trying to guess Balsa's next move, or conducting intelligence-gathering agaist Touya clearly show they are not only skilled but intelligent. Even the emperor, who issues the order for Chagum's assassination, clearly hates having to choose between his son and his people. There are no villains in this story, but instead many different people who are all trying to to the right thing.The story is almost acceptable for younger children, though it does move a little slowly at times. The fight scenes are quite realistic and intense - no slow-mo martial arts stuff here. But it is not particularly bloody, for Balsa has sworn to never take another life. It is also rich enough that someone who doesn't watch anime could enjoy it too - it doesn't even use any of the stock anime cliches. Instead, Moribito stands proudly on its own, a sterling example of storytelling.",5,"Beautiful, intricaate, and very satisfying",1304985600,"05 10, 2011",2011,2540,"['Moribito', 'fantasy', 'story', 'where', 'female', 'bodyguard', 'Balsa', 'job', 'guarding', 'boy', 'prince', 'prince', 'been', 'possessed', 'water', 'spirit/demon', 'father', 'tries', 'have', 'killed', 'time', 'spend', 'together', 'Balsa', 'care', 'boy', 'young', 'prince', 'young', 'man.Other', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'provided', 'more', 'details', 'rich', 'plot', 'will', 'not', 'reiterate', 'However', 'do', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'elements', 'story', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'First', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'visual', 'detail', 'setting', 'backgrounds', 'were', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'city', 'settings', 'are', 'very', 'rich', 'really', 'feel', 'real', 'place', 'food', 'rendered', 'such', 'detail', 'almost', 'hungry', 'EVen', 'visual', 'details', 'water', 'mill', 'storehouse', 'Hunter', 'Hole', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'almost', 'made', 'buy', 'series', 'again', 'Blu-Ray.In', 'addition', 'visuals', 'setting', 'detail', 'extremely', 'well-done', 'lot', 'background', 'information', 'how', 'people', 'live', 'workings', 'aforementioned', 'water', 'mill', 'how', 'Balsa', 'company', 'prepare', 'winter', 'Hunter', 'Hole', 'how', 'blacksmith', 'swords', 'Very', 'nicely', 'done', 'could', 'show', 'series', 'history', 'class.I', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'two-dimensional', 'Balsa', 'Prince', 'Chagum', 'are', 'well-developed', 'carry', 'story', 'well', 'Tanda', 'Balsa', 'herbalist', 'friend', 'also', 'good', 'strong', 'character', 'being', 'combat', 'monster', 'even', 'antagonists', 'are', 'detailed', 'elite', 'royal', 'guards', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'bunch', 'skilled', 'fighters', 'demonstrate', 'loyalty', 'dedication', 'ingenuity', 'Seeing', 'trying', 'guess', 'Balsa', 'next', 'move', 'conducting', 'intelligence-gathering', 'agaist', 'Touya', 'clearly', 'show', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'skilled', 'intelligent', 'Even', 'emperor', 'who', 'issues', 'order', 'Chagum', 'assassination', 'clearly', 'having', 'choose', 'son', 'people', 'are', 'villains', 'story', 'instead', 'many', 'different', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'right', 'thing.The', 'story', 'almost', 'acceptable', 'younger', 'children', 'move', 'little', 'slowly', 'times', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'realistic', 'intense', 'slow-mo', 'martial', 'arts', 'stuff', 'here', 'not', 'particularly', 'bloody', 'Balsa', 'sworn', 'never', 'take', 'life', 'also', 'rich', 'enough', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'watch', 'anime', 'could', 'enjoy', 'too', ""n't"", 'even', 'use', 'stock', 'anime', 'cliches', 'Instead', 'Moribito', 'proudly', 'own', 'sterling', 'example', 'storytelling']",Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit - Complete Collection

1326876,A3PJQ4742VN84H,B0035RWG0M,"Hope this helps ""help""","[1, 1]","""Moribito"" is a beautiful fantasy series with many mature overtones.  But one needs to approach this knowing what they are getting into.FOR PARENTS AND OTHER CONCERNED FOLKS...There really isn't much swearing...I honestly can't remember any.  So that area's pretty much safe.  Also, absolutely no fanservice (amazing, right? haha).  In fact, the few ""hot springs"" scenes that exist aren't troubling at all.  They are very serious and add to the plot progression/character expansion.  Also, the ladies wear some kind of full body gown.  So there's nothing to worry about concerning visual content.  The violence is not many, but what exists isn't very gratuitous...while remaining very artistic and dramatic...and very important for the plot and story telling.MOVING ON...PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):When I first purchased this, I was looking for more of an action series.  It was definitely very different than what I expected.  One best enjoys when they realize that they will be watching a drama, not a pure adrenaline-action flick.  After getting past the ""shock"" that this wasn't what I was expecting, I found this to be a very engaging and beautiful work...no regrets.  The pacing is purposely slow, but always progressing and no time is ever really wasted.  In fact, even the fight sequences are emotional at times, and their own narratives in of themselves.  Everything is virtually counted towards the story.  I also loved how the story wasn't very one sided (meaning seen by one group or person entirely), but all the events were seen and experienced by multiple perspectives and angles.  Each was completely independent while still influencing/complimenting the decisions and situations of the others (and because of this, you really got to know many of the characters from all sides).  The characters, themselves, are very believable and realistic...and very relatable.  You can tell how much thought and refining went into the background and psyche of each character (stated and unstated).ANIMATION/PRODUCTION STYLE:Rarely do I find a need to comment on animation/production style.  But, the world that is drawn and depicted in ""Moribito"" is simply beautiful and stunning.  This isn't pop-anime style like ""Full Metal Alchemist"", ""Naruto"" or ""Inuyasha"".  Rather, it's a very cinematic and full animation style.  The world is vibrant and full of color, while still being very natural and real in look.  The use of light and shading is subtle, but greatly influences the mood.  Also, the characters have many subtle details about them that help maintain the realism.  Also, the characters are naturally proportioned with no real exaggerations...while still being visually attractive and amusing.  Simply put, it leans towards the more mature and serious style of animation...and it does it with class.  The crew really put some love and care into this project.SUB VERSUS DUB:When dealing with foreign films that have options for dubs, I often enjoy trying out both.  I've found some shows that Subs seem to fit better, and some Dubs that are simply brilliant.  In the case of ""Moribito"", it's dub is quite phenomenal and fitting.  The script is natural and smart.  The voices they chose not only matched the characters, but they were very expressive...and very complimentary to the visuals.  I definitely prefer the dub.PACKAGING:The set consists of 8 discs.  It's all contained in a single DVD case that is roughly the size of two standard single-DVD cases combined.  The discs are pretty safe and secure from my experience, however, some may still be a little concerned that all 8 discs are stacked on top of each other with nothing dividing them.  I was concerned, too.  But I've had it for quite a couple years now and haven't really gotten scratches.  This is probably because there are notches, as well as surrounding walls, that keeps the discs from moving.  So unless you have some strange penchant for spinning your discs hard against each other in a DVD case, they should be alright.ALL IN ALL...This is a slow but very good animated series.  Many good lessons and a complexed yet simple narrative.  Good plot development and character growth.  Beautiful fight sequences that help move the story is also a plus.  The lore is captivating and the world is simply stunning.  It's not for everyone, definitely one worth risking a chance to see if it is for you :-)",4,"If You Know What You Are Getting Into, It really is a Beautiful Series...",1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,4382,"['Moribito', 'beautiful', 'fantasy', 'series', 'many', 'mature', 'overtones', 'one', 'approach', 'knowing', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'into.FOR', 'PARENTS', 'AND', 'OTHER', 'CONCERNED', 'FOLKS', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'swearing', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'area', 'pretty', 'much', 'safe', 'Also', 'absolutely', 'fanservice', 'amazing', 'right', 'haha', 'fact', 'few', 'hot', 'springs', 'scenes', 'exist', 'are', ""n't"", 'troubling', 'are', 'very', 'serious', 'add', 'plot', 'progression/character', 'expansion', 'Also', 'ladies', 'wear', 'kind', 'full', 'body', 'gown', 'nothing', 'worry', 'concerning', 'visual', 'content', 'violence', 'not', 'many', 'what', ""n't"", 'very', 'gratuitous', 'remaining', 'very', 'artistic', 'dramatic', 'very', 'important', 'plot', 'story', 'telling.MOVING', 'ON', 'PLOT', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'NO', 'SPOILERS', 'When', 'first', 'purchased', 'was', 'looking', 'more', 'action', 'series', 'was', 'definitely', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'expected', 'One', 'best', 'when', 'realize', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'drama', 'not', 'pure', 'adrenaline-action', 'flick', 'getting', 'shock', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'engaging', 'beautiful', 'work', 'regrets', 'pacing', 'purposely', 'slow', 'always', 'progressing', 'time', 'ever', 'really', 'wasted', 'fact', 'even', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'emotional', 'times', 'own', 'narratives', 'Everything', 'virtually', 'counted', 'story', 'also', 'loved', 'how', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'one', 'sided', 'meaning', 'seen', 'one', 'group', 'person', 'entirely', 'events', 'were', 'seen', 'experienced', 'multiple', 'perspectives', 'angles', 'was', 'completely', 'independent', 'still', 'influencing/complimenting', 'decisions', 'situations', 'others', 'really', 'got', 'know', 'many', 'characters', 'sides', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'realistic', 'very', 'relatable', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'thought', 'refining', 'went', 'background', 'psyche', 'character', 'stated', 'unstated', '.ANIMATION/PRODUCTION', 'STYLE', 'Rarely', 'do', 'find', 'need', 'comment', 'animation/production', 'style', 'world', 'drawn', 'depicted', 'Moribito', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'stunning', ""n't"", 'pop-anime', 'style', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'Naruto', 'Inuyasha', 'Rather', 'very', 'cinematic', 'full', 'animation', 'style', 'world', 'vibrant', 'full', 'color', 'still', 'being', 'very', 'natural', 'real', 'look', 'use', 'light', 'shading', 'subtle', 'greatly', 'mood', 'Also', 'characters', 'have', 'many', 'subtle', 'details', 'help', 'maintain', 'realism', 'Also', 'characters', 'are', 'naturally', 'proportioned', 'real', 'exaggerations', 'still', 'being', 'visually', 'attractive', 'amusing', 'Simply', 'put', 'more', 'mature', 'serious', 'style', 'animation', 'class', 'crew', 'really', 'put', 'love', 'care', 'project.SUB', 'VERSUS', 'DUB', 'When', 'dealing', 'foreign', 'films', 'have', 'options', 'dubs', 'often', 'enjoy', 'trying', 'out', ""'ve"", 'found', 'shows', 'Subs', 'seem', 'fit', 'better', 'Dubs', 'are', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'case', 'Moribito', 'dub', 'quite', 'phenomenal', 'fitting', 'script', 'natural', 'smart', 'voices', 'chose', 'not', 'only', 'matched', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'expressive', 'very', 'complimentary', 'visuals', 'definitely', 'prefer', 'dub.PACKAGING', 'set', '8', 'discs', 'contained', 'single', 'DVD', 'case', 'roughly', 'size', 'two', 'standard', 'single-DVD', 'cases', 'combined', 'discs', 'are', 'pretty', 'safe', 'secure', 'experience', 'however', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'little', 'concerned', '8', 'discs', 'are', 'stacked', 'top', 'other', 'nothing', 'dividing', 'was', 'concerned', 'too', ""'ve"", 'had', 'quite', 'couple', 'years', 'now', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'gotten', 'scratches', 'probably', 'are', 'notches', 'as', 'well', 'surrounding', 'walls', 'discs', 'moving', 'So', 'have', 'strange', 'penchant', 'spinning', 'discs', 'hard', 'other', 'DVD', 'case', 'should', 'be', 'alright.ALL', 'IN', 'ALL', 'slow', 'very', 'good', 'animated', 'series', 'Many', 'good', 'lessons', 'complexed', 'yet', 'simple', 'narrative', 'Good', 'plot', 'development', 'character', 'growth', 'Beautiful', 'fight', 'sequences', 'help', 'move', 'story', 'also', 'plus', 'lore', 'captivating', 'world', 'simply', 'stunning', 'not', 'everyone', 'definitely', 'one', 'worth', 'risking', 'chance', 'see']",Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit - Complete Collection

Chagum is possessed by a water spirit that is believed to be a curse on the land. The Emperor wants his son killed. Chagum's Mother hires Balsa to take him away and protect him from the Emperor's assassins. On  But on their journey, they learn that the water spirit is not a curse, but a blessing. The fate of the Guardian of the Spirit is a different story. The Guardians of the past have all suffered a terrible death. Can Balsa and her friends save Chagum and in turn save the entire country?This anime is simply breathtaking. It took me about 5 episodes to really get into it, but after that point, I was totally sold. I have 0ver 300 anime series. Needless to say I have seen a wide variety of good and bad shows. This one stands out from many others. It's a very unique series, but if I had to give you a frame of reference, I'd say it's in the same category as Princess Mononoke. I know you may call bull on that statement, but it's not too far from the truth. Moribito combines the supernatural and the feudal era quite a lot like Mononoke or Iuyasha. The series has great depth, and character development.The animation, soundtrack and voice cast are all great in this series as well. Careful attention to the details of the story was payed.I can't think of a single complaint with this series. At first, I thought this was shaping up to be another typical action series. It isn't like that at all. While there is some violence, it's very conservative on the blood and gore issue. The main focus of this series is the story, and the characters. One of the best things about Moribito is the large cast. There are a lot of great and very memorable characters. It's totally serious, so don't expect any comedy or fan service. Sometimes I anime throws that stuff in to keep you interested. I even find myself thinking sometimes that a series would be better if there were more of that stuff. I never thought that way about Moribito. I became so engrossed in the plot, that I never wished for something funny or a little pervy to happen at all. This series is just an amazing drama. That leaves nothing to be desired.I think that everyone can find something to love about this anime. I can't believe that I just discovered it in 2013. I thought that I had seen everything that was worth watching. This proves that there are still shows out there that are easy to overlook, but still rank up there with some of the best anime series available. I can't recommend this show enough.

Don't get me wrong, I think the story and the beautifully drawn environments make the series watchable.  I just think that for a premise based on a ""champion woman spear-wielder protecting a fledgling young prince,"" there would be more conflict.  When the action sequences do occur, they are very sharp and intricate (no slow strikes or generic back and forth movement).  Maybe this gap in action is intentional; so that the viewer is sort of FORCED to pay attention to the meat of the story, which in itself is nicely told without too much backtracking.The characters are greatly developed, but the only qualm I have with them is that they tend to be ""a little TOO dramatic"".  And that is actually quoting my wife, who happened to be walking by while I was watching an episode. I actually agreed with her.  I know this series covers some tough life lessons and realities of their world.  But I think a real human being would react differently in some scenarios.To sum it up...this is, for the most part, almost a kid-friendly tale of trying to survive a destiny that puts you directly in harms way, with the help of a few friends.  Yes there is action, but not enough for ""action-buffs.""  Yes there is a good story, but perhaps dragged out longer than necessary.  I gave this DVD Collection 3 stars because it is beautifully drawn, partially encapsulating, and a decent watch from beginning to end, but leaves you thirsting for a little faster pace.I will not comment on the way the dvd's are stored in the case (suffice to say, I try to be very careful with the discs).",3,great story...but slightly disappointed,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,1723,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'person', 'watching', 'anime', 'needs', 'be', 'wow', ""'d"", '10', 'seconds', 'action', 'fight', 'squence', 'Moribito', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'touch', 'more', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'think', 'story', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'environments', 'make', 'series', 'watchable', 'just', 'think', 'premise', 'based', 'champion', 'woman', 'spear-wielder', 'protecting', 'fledgling', 'young', 'prince', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'conflict', 'When', 'action', 'sequences', 'do', 'occur', 'are', 'very', 'sharp', 'intricate', 'slow', 'strikes', 'generic', 'back', 'forth', 'movement', 'Maybe', 'gap', 'action', 'intentional', 'viewer', 'sort', 'FORCED', 'pay', 'attention', 'meat', 'story', 'nicely', 'told', 'too', 'much', 'backtracking.The', 'characters', 'are', 'greatly', 'developed', 'only', 'qualm', 'have', 'tend', 'be', 'little', 'TOO', 'dramatic', 'actually', 'quoting', 'wife', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'walking', 'was', 'watching', 'episode', 'actually', 'agreed', 'know', 'series', 'tough', 'life', 'lessons', 'realities', 'world', 'think', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'would', 'react', 'differently', 'scenarios.To', 'sum', 'up', 'most', 'part', 'almost', 'kid-friendly', 'tale', 'trying', 'survive', 'destiny', 'directly', 'harms', 'way', 'help', 'few', 'friends', 'action', 'not', 'enough', 'action-buffs', 'Yes', 'good', 'story', 'perhaps', 'dragged', 'out', 'longer', 'necessary', 'gave', 'DVD', 'Collection', '3', 'stars', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'partially', 'encapsulating', 'decent', 'watch', 'beginning', 'end', 'thirsting', 'little', 'faster', 'pace.I', 'will', 'not', 'comment', 'way', 'dvd', 'are', 'stored', 'case', 'suffice', 'say', 'try', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'discs']",Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit - Complete Collection

This demon is believed to be very powerful and the Mikado believes it must be destroyed, even if it means killing his own son.  The Mikado's wife wants to save her son, so she hires Balsa, a professional bodyguard, to protect her son from the Mikado.  Much of the story involves Balsa and the prince running from, hiding from, and occassionally fighting the men the Mikado sends after the prince.  Meanwhile, they have to discover the truth behind the spirit possessing the boy.  Much later, we learn Balsa's backstory.  The series is unique in that there really is no villian, when you think about it.I admit it's lame, uncreative, and boring to compare this to another anime, but I'm going to do it anyway, since I don't have much experience with the genre.  This series has fewer episodes, characters, subplots, creepy stuff, fight scenes, tearjerking moments and less humor (or attempts at humor) than Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, but I like it anyway.  My only real complaint with the series is that the 26 episode format makes the story feel a little slow and drawn out.  The animation is done in a (mostly) realistic style.  The fight scenes are mostly realistic as well, except for those times when the heroine is fighting while running backwards.  The voice acting is very well done.  No fanservice to speak of.  Not too violent, (most of the fight scenes are relatively bloodless, which is odd, since Balsa's weapon is a spear) though I guess any blood at all makes something PG-13 these days.",4,Well done,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,1602,"['son', 'Mikado', 'possessed', 'spirit', 'Mikado', 'be', 'evil', 'demon', 'demon', 'believed', 'be', 'very', 'powerful', 'Mikado', 'must', 'be', 'destroyed', 'even', 'killing', 'own', 'son', 'Mikado', 'wife', 'save', 'son', 'Balsa', 'professional', 'bodyguard', 'protect', 'son', 'Mikado', 'Much', 'story', 'Balsa', 'prince', 'running', 'hiding', 'occassionally', 'fighting', 'men', 'Mikado', 'sends', 'prince', 'Meanwhile', 'have', 'discover', 'truth', 'spirit', 'possessing', 'boy', 'Much', 'later', 'learn', 'Balsa', 'backstory', 'series', 'unique', 'really', 'villian', 'when', 'think', 'it.I', 'admit', 'lame', 'uncreative', 'boring', 'compare', 'anime', ""'m"", 'going', 'do', 'anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'experience', 'genre', 'series', 'fewer', 'episodes', 'characters', 'subplots', 'creepy', 'stuff', 'fight', 'scenes', 'tearjerking', 'moments', 'less', 'humor', 'attempts', 'humor', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Brotherhood', 'like', 'anyway', 'My', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'series', '26', 'episode', 'format', 'story', 'feel', 'little', 'slow', 'drawn', 'out', 'animation', 'done', 'mostly', 'realistic', 'style', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'mostly', 'realistic', 'as', 'well', 'times', 'when', 'heroine', 'fighting', 'running', 'backwards', 'voice', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'fanservice', 'speak', 'Not', 'too', 'violent', 'most', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'relatively', 'bloodless', 'odd', 'Balsa', 'weapon', 'spear', 'guess', 'blood', 'something', 'PG-13', 'days']",Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit - Complete Collection

While journeying to fulfill her oath, she finds her first opportunity in Prince Chagum. The young prince has had the misfortune to become possessed by a strange water spirit and his own father has ordered his assassination. While fleeing from the Emperor's assassins, Balsa and Chagum form a close bond, and soon Balsa protects him from affection rather than her oath. In order to save the prince, Balsa and her friends must unravel the mystery behind Chagum's possession and the changes affecting the land.Based on the first book of the Moribito series, Seirei no Moribito (Guardian of the Spirit) is one of those series that reminds you that anime can sometimes move beyond stereotypes and clich&eacute;d story lines and have characters with depth and a story with layers. The anime closely follows the book, which works greatly to its advantage. The only times it deviates from the source material, is when it needs to expand the story to fill 26 episodes.Balsa and Chagum are really likable characters. I thought for sure Chagum would be a spoiled brat, but he adapts quite well to his new life. Not that there aren't some bumps; he does go through a rather dramatic change in lifestyle and on top of it all, is possessed by a water spirit. But his character manages to overcome these challenges and grow. Balsa is one of the few female characters in anime that I like. She is strong, but not invincible, but that doesn't hold her back. The supporting characters are also complex and interesting, and there are enough of them to add diversity, but not so many that they can't have time to develop.I believe I read at one point that the world in which Balsa and Co. live in is entirely fictional, thought it draws many elements from various Asian countries. I certainly felt the Asian influence, but I couldn't say it felt like any culture in particular, which made it feel all the more real. It was very well planned and the animation really brought it to life. I enjoyed the art style for this series - it was very easy on the eyes and enjoyable to watch. It was also nice to have something that felt unique, and not like every other anime out there.That said, this release is TERRIBLE. It looks like someone just took all of the eight individual discs and stacked them on top of each other in a single DVD case. Content is ok, the extras include clean credits and previews, but the presentation is just so cheap. I shudder to think about the next time I watch this series and have to pull out all of the DVDs every time I swap to the next one. But I guess I got what I paid for.

The basic story-plot of the series is that the second prince of the kingdom is feared cursed and will be about the destruction of his peoples lands but his mother forsakes this prophecy and enlists the aid of a wandering female warrior who rescued her son previously from drowning and feels she will be able to protect her son from the machinations of the royal courts decree.  Along the way of the series we see the true reason of the royal courts fears as well as the true destiny of the young prince,  the one thing that endears you to the series other than the fantastic story,  animation,  and characters is actually the prince himself.  I thought that like previous series with this kind of story you would have the prince as a young pampered brat,  but this prince turns out to be actually sincere in his desires to help the people and his own personality to do the work and interact with the people on a personal level not acting at all like a stuck up royal prince.  The series won't be for everyone if you're expecting some hardcore supernatural fights or powerful demons to cause destruction that you'll be disappointed,  but if you've seen the series mentioned above or another one called Princess Mononoke than this series will be just for you.  The audio and video are done well with the added bonus extras being a nice touch,  if there's any complaint it would be the box set itself like mentioned before the set is eight dvds put into a single dvd case with a center spindle to stack one dvd on top of another which I found annoying but hey for the price of $15.00 dollars instead of the $95.00 dollars for the other set I can look pass this.  So for a great Edo era action anime with a great cast and story-line here's a wonderful choice for anyone.",5,A Fantastic And UnderRated Series Worth A Look,1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,1882,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'Shonen', 'Onmyouji', 'Twelve', 'Kingdoms', 'here', 'fantastic', 'series', 'time', 'basic', 'story-plot', 'series', 'second', 'prince', 'kingdom', 'feared', 'cursed', 'will', 'be', 'destruction', 'peoples', 'lands', 'mother', 'prophecy', 'aid', 'wandering', 'female', 'warrior', 'who', 'rescued', 'son', 'previously', 'drowning', 'feels', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'protect', 'son', 'machinations', 'royal', 'courts', 'decree', 'way', 'series', 'see', 'true', 'reason', 'royal', 'courts', 'fears', 'as', 'well', 'true', 'destiny', 'young', 'prince', 'one', 'thing', 'series', 'other', 'fantastic', 'story', 'animation', 'characters', 'actually', 'prince', 'thought', 'previous', 'series', 'kind', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'prince', 'young', 'pampered', 'brat', 'prince', 'out', 'be', 'actually', 'sincere', 'desires', 'help', 'people', 'own', 'personality', 'do', 'work', 'interact', 'people', 'personal', 'level', 'not', 'acting', 'stuck', 'up', 'royal', 'prince', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'hardcore', 'supernatural', 'fights', 'powerful', 'demons', 'cause', 'destruction', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'mentioned', 'one', 'called', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'added', 'bonus', 'extras', 'being', 'nice', 'touch', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'box', 'set', 'mentioned', 'set', 'eight', 'dvds', 'put', 'single', 'dvd', 'case', 'center', 'spindle', 'stack', 'one', 'dvd', 'top', 'found', 'annoying', 'hey', 'price', '15.00', 'dollars', 'instead', '95.00', 'dollars', 'other', 'set', 'can', 'look', 'pass', 'So', 'great', 'Edo', 'era', 'action', 'anime', 'great', 'cast', 'story-line', 'here', 'wonderful', 'choice', 'anyone']",Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit - Complete Collection

The animation is excellent! Their aren't as many fight scenes as the cover suggests, but they are all well done and the action flows unlike some anime with the movements are stiff and rigid. It's also a great anime for someone who really enjoys a historical/mythological Japanese feel as the story revolves around a boy (the emperor's son) possessed by the egg of a benevolent water spirit.

From beginning to end, there is not a full moment. Not always fight scenes but its not necessary because unlike a lot of crap series, this one actually has a good story and it gets pretty deep if you pay attention. Having been an otaku since the early 90's I have seen about 100 series or more and I highly recommend this one. Though I don't mind fan service, this series doest contain any and it is not needed at all and I'm glad it doesn't. it's not needed. this is a great tale and has 2 awesome protagonists that are well developed over time. this is not an anime to be missed. I did not buy this anime from here so I can't feel the pain some of you have with bad packaging lol. I found myself the complete collectors edit. for a special deal at $20. All 8 discs in their OWN case and a pretty cool art box to hold them all in. if you can find that one anywhere get it, the individual cases are awesome. high quality like I've never seen before and each had art work on front and sketches inside of the characters.

I honestly thought this was going to be more of a fighting/action Anime. While there are fights in the series, there is also much more to it. I would have thought that there was going to be a fight in every episode with plenty of bloodshed and cool moves. Boy was I wrong!I mean this in a good way. In fact, I think this is an excellent Anime to add to anyone's collection.  Balsa is a strong, confident protagonist who is far from stereotypical in the Anime sense. There's absolutely no fan service in this story --if that's what you're looking for then you're going to be sorely disappointed. She's not giggly nor bubbly or any kind of exaggerated version of anything. It's patently refreshing.While you'd expect Prince Chagum to be spoiled and bratty,maybe even a little whiney --he isn't. He takes his lot with cool grace and strives to find nobility in every day actions as he learns to live as a commoner. You can see him grow as both a young man, and a prince under Balsa's influence.The other characters all provide a rich backdrop to this story come to life, making it visually appealing as well as smart, and sometimes funny. Even the minor characters get fleshed out to make them real and engaging. Balsa's past provides just as much conflict as the Prince's current situation. Even the ""Bad Guys"" aren't what they seem. It's truly an epic situation in which you feel for all those involved as they are forced to act this way out of their duty. You even feel for the Mikado --forced to kill his own son because they believe he's possessed by a water demon.If you want to watch something intelligent and entertaining, I'd surely recommend this to anyone without hesitation.",5,Much more than I expected...,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,1770,"['once', 'while', 'pick', 'out', 'Anime', 'collection', 'good', 'way', 'honestly', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'fighting/action', 'Anime', 'are', 'fights', 'series', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'fight', 'episode', 'plenty', 'bloodshed', 'cool', 'moves', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'mean', 'good', 'way', 'fact', 'think', 'excellent', 'Anime', 'add', 'anyone', 'collection', 'Balsa', 'strong', 'confident', 'protagonist', 'who', 'far', 'stereotypical', 'Anime', 'sense', 'absolutely', 'fan', 'service', 'story', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'then', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'not', 'giggly', 'bubbly', 'kind', 'exaggerated', 'version', 'anything', 'patently', 'refreshing.While', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Prince', 'Chagum', 'be', 'spoiled', 'bratty', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'whiney', ""n't"", 'lot', 'cool', 'grace', 'strives', 'find', 'nobility', 'day', 'actions', 'live', 'commoner', 'can', 'see', 'grow', 'young', 'man', 'prince', 'Balsa', 'influence.The', 'other', 'characters', 'provide', 'rich', 'backdrop', 'story', 'come', 'life', 'making', 'visually', 'appealing', 'as', 'well', 'smart', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'get', 'fleshed', 'out', 'make', 'real', 'engaging', 'Balsa', 'past', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'conflict', 'Prince', 'current', 'situation', 'Even', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'seem', 'truly', 'epic', 'situation', 'feel', 'involved', 'are', 'forced', 'act', 'way', 'duty', 'even', 'feel', 'Mikado', 'forced', 'kill', 'own', 'son', 'believe', 'possessed', 'water', 'demon.If', 'want', 'watch', 'something', 'intelligent', 'entertaining', ""'d"", 'surely', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'hesitation']",Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit - Complete Collection
