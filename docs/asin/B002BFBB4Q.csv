He played a moron in That 70's Show so long that people are afraid to give him a shot at a real role. I wasn't a fan of him before, but this movie is incredible.The Butterfly Effect is an exciting, suspense-filled, emotion-driven movie with occassional laughs and a unique premise. All around one of the greater products of Hollywood. You care about the lives of each character, and as the story unfolds, you fall more in love with them without being bored.BE2 has nothing to do with the first one. The main protagonist begins suffering migraines one day accompanied with a bloody nose (which by the way is done so poorly you can actually SEE the actor wiping the blood from his hand TO his nose for the ""effect""). Sometimes after a migraine he will randomly be ""poofed"" into the past to an uneventful and pointless time in his life.The acting is atrocious. There's no plot or character development. 35-40 somethings are playing youthful 25 year-olds (and BADLY). I won't spoil it for you, but if you watch it you will too ask yourself, ""WTF, that baby makes no sense."" It doesn't fit in any of the other future events and its unnecessary. It's like at the last minute during filming the director's wife brought their child to the filming location and said ""OH, OH, PUT OUR SON IN THE SHOT!""I have seen far better, lower-budgeted films. It's boring as all hell. In fact, it was SO bad that my boyfriend and I started playing Magic: The Gathering while it was playing in the background (he won :( ). The were 2 times BE2 bad my undivided attention: the sex scenes. The were good. So good in fact, I'm convinced that this director shot pornos prior to this. Yeah. He should stick to that.Buy the Butterfly Effect. If you want both cheap then just fast-forward BE2 to those scenes. Life's too short to spend it on bad movies. Hey, atleast I got it used at a low dirt price.",3,"Kutcher at his finest, 'sequel' at its worst",1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,2015,"['Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'best', 'performances', 'are', 'showcased', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'Kutcher', 'talent', 'been', 'squandered', 'most', 'career', 'played', 'moron', '70', 'Show', 'so', 'long', 'people', 'are', 'afraid', 'give', 'shot', 'real', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'movie', 'incredible.The', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'exciting', 'suspense-filled', 'emotion-driven', 'movie', 'occassional', 'laughs', 'unique', 'premise', 'one', 'greater', 'products', 'Hollywood', 'care', 'lives', 'character', 'story', 'unfolds', 'fall', 'more', 'love', 'being', 'bored.BE2', 'nothing', 'do', 'first', 'one', 'main', 'protagonist', 'suffering', 'migraines', 'one', 'day', 'accompanied', 'bloody', 'nose', 'way', 'done', 'so', 'poorly', 'can', 'actually', 'SEE', 'actor', 'wiping', 'blood', 'hand', 'TO', 'nose', 'effect', 'Sometimes', 'migraine', 'will', 'randomly', 'be', 'poofed', 'past', 'uneventful', 'pointless', 'time', 'life.The', 'acting', 'atrocious', 'plot', 'character', 'development', '35-40', 'somethings', 'are', 'playing', 'youthful', '25', 'year-olds', 'BADLY', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'watch', 'will', 'too', 'ask', 'WTF', 'baby', 'sense', ""n't"", 'fit', 'other', 'future', 'events', 'unnecessary', 'last', 'minute', 'filming', 'director', 'wife', 'brought', 'child', 'filming', 'location', 'said', 'OH', 'OH', 'PUT', 'OUR', 'SON', 'IN', 'THE', 'SHOT', 'have', 'seen', 'far', 'better', 'lower-budgeted', 'films', 'boring', 'hell', 'fact', 'was', 'SO', 'bad', 'boyfriend', 'started', 'playing', 'Magic', 'Gathering', 'was', 'playing', 'background', 'won', 'were', '2', 'times', 'BE2', 'bad', 'undivided', 'attention', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'good', 'So', 'good', 'fact', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'director', 'shot', 'pornos', 'prior', 'Yeah', 'should', 'stick', 'that.Buy', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'want', 'cheap', 'then', 'just', 'fast-forward', 'BE2', 'scenes', 'Life', 'too', 'short', 'spend', 'bad', 'movies', 'Hey', 'atleast', 'got', 'used', 'low', 'dirt', 'price']",N/A
1259681,A17HQQGIT3PDWJ,B002BFBB4Q,G.M. Vans,"[1, 1]","After reviewing ""The Butterfly Effect Collection"", I must admit that I enjoyed the second story more than the initial film.  I thought that there were too many possible scenarios in the first film.  In my opinion, it was sort of confusing to me.  I had to watch the Butterfly Effect about three times before I ""got it"".  And, I thought that the presence of Actor Ashton Kutcher would make the film more specious; but, it didn't.  I wasn't bored watching this movie.  But, I couldn't wait for it to end.  Whereas, The Butterfly Effect 2 was interesting and amusing.  Again, the film presented different scenarios of an event; but, the director didn't overdo it .  It was enjoyable.
