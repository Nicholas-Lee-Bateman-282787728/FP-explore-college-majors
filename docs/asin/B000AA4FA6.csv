924680,A69PKBKBVUJ61,B000AA4FA6,Dave99,"[19, 19]","I remember that when this film played in theatres here way back when, the newspaper ads included the proviso that, due to the explicit nature of the film, photography was strictly prohibited.  ""Who's going to take photos of a movie?,"" I thought.  I figured it was just a gimmick to play up the sex in the film.  I also imagined that Ursula Andress' career must have really gone downhill to have participated in a trashy quasi-porn film like this.  Having recently watched the DVD, I can say that I was right about the amount of skin seen in the film (especially by '70s standards).  The nice booklet that No Shame Films provides with the DVD also explains that Andress was no longer on the A-list of actors as she had been.  What I was wrong about was the film itself, as it turns out that it's quite enjoyable and fun to watch!Leonida, the patriarch of the Bottacin family of wine producers, is in a bad way.  He's just had a heart attack while in bed with the local gravedigger's wife - and his family couldn't be happier.  Nieces Jole and Italia, nephew Gustavo and (especially) Italia's husband Benito can't wait for the old man to kick the bucket so they can make a deal with American gangster Mr. Kitch to go international.  The trouble is that Leonida won't go so quickly, so Benito hires Anna, his sexy former nurse (and bed mate) to quicken the old boy's pulse and cause a second, fatal heart attack.  Add in Jole's son Adone (the only relative who wants the old man to live), Giovanni (the frequently drunk servant) and Tosca (whose services to the family go well beyond cleaning and cooking) and you've got the makings of lots of mayhem.Besides Andress (whose scenes include a nice nude swim), the cast is lead by Duilio Del Prete, doing a lot of physical comedy in his role of Benito.  One of the highlights is when he tries to show Anna the 'proper' way of caring for Leonida to do him in - to which she replies that he may die laughing.  Mario Pisu is funny as Leonida (especially in his final scenes), Carla Romanelli is quite delightful as Tosca, while former Bond girl Luciana Paluzzi (""Thunderball"") joins in the racy goings-on with a topless scene.  Jack Palance also has a few short scenes as Mr. Kitch - and it's rather evident that he enjoyed himself in the process!The picture quality on DVD is good, enhanced for widescreen sets and filling the screen.  The video box says that the proper aspect ratio is 1.66:1, which would mean that a bit had to be trimmed from the top and bottom to fill the screen, but I couldn't notice anything missing.  There are two soundtracks, Italian and English, and I chose to listen to the Italian with the optional English subtitles.  Though the subtitles are easy to read, I found myself going back a few times to re-read them as some went by too fast - a small price to pay, as I always prefer the original language to get the proper feel of the film.  The DVD also includes interviews with director Nello Rossati and his brother Tony, the costume designer; the trailer; a poster and still photo gallery; and an informative 8 page booklet (the norm for No Shame releases) which is such a rarity these days.As that booklet states, "" 'The Sensuous Nurse' will never be mistaken for a remarkable film but it does have its charms.""  I wholeheartedly agree.  While it's not a classic by Fellini or Antonioni, the film is a lot of fun, with enough laughs and amusements to bring a smile to your face.",4,"""L'Infermiera"" - a cure for the blues",1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,3452,"['remember', 'when', 'film', 'played', 'theatres', 'here', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'newspaper', 'ads', 'included', 'proviso', 'due', 'explicit', 'nature', 'film', 'photography', 'was', 'strictly', 'prohibited', 'Who', 'going', 'take', 'photos', 'movie', 'thought', 'figured', 'was', 'just', 'gimmick', 'play', 'up', 'sex', 'film', 'also', 'imagined', 'Ursula', 'Andress', 'career', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'gone', 'downhill', 'have', 'participated', 'trashy', 'quasi-porn', 'film', 'Having', 'recently', 'watched', 'DVD', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'right', 'amount', 'skin', 'seen', 'film', 'especially', ""'70s"", 'standards', 'nice', 'booklet', 'Shame', 'Films', 'DVD', 'also', 'Andress', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'A-list', 'actors', 'had', 'been', 'What', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'film', 'out', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'watch', 'Leonida', 'patriarch', 'Bottacin', 'family', 'wine', 'producers', 'bad', 'way', 'just', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'bed', 'local', 'gravedigger', 'wife', 'family', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'Nieces', 'Jole', 'Italia', 'nephew', 'Gustavo', 'especially', 'Italia', 'husband', 'Benito', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'old', 'man', 'kick', 'bucket', 'can', 'make', 'deal', 'American', 'gangster', 'Mr.', 'Kitch', 'go', 'international', 'trouble', 'Leonida', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'quickly', 'Benito', 'hires', 'Anna', 'sexy', 'former', 'nurse', 'bed', 'mate', 'quicken', 'old', 'boy', 'pulse', 'cause', 'second', 'fatal', 'heart', 'attack', 'Add', 'Jole', 'son', 'Adone', 'only', 'relative', 'who', 'old', 'man', 'live', 'Giovanni', 'frequently', 'drunk', 'servant', 'Tosca', 'services', 'family', 'go', 'well', 'cleaning', 'cooking', ""'ve"", 'got', 'makings', 'lots', 'mayhem.Besides', 'Andress', 'scenes', 'include', 'nice', 'nude', 'swim', 'cast', 'lead', 'Duilio', 'Del', 'Prete', 'doing', 'lot', 'physical', 'comedy', 'role', 'Benito', 'One', 'highlights', 'when', 'show', 'Anna', ""'proper"", 'way', 'caring', 'Leonida', 'do', 'may', 'die', 'laughing', 'Mario', 'Pisu', 'funny', 'Leonida', 'especially', 'final', 'scenes', 'Carla', 'Romanelli', 'quite', 'delightful', 'Tosca', 'former', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Luciana', 'Paluzzi', 'Thunderball', 'racy', 'goings-on', 'topless', 'scene', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'also', 'few', 'short', 'scenes', 'Mr.', 'Kitch', 'rather', 'evident', 'enjoyed', 'process', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'good', 'enhanced', 'widescreen', 'sets', 'filling', 'screen', 'video', 'box', 'proper', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.66:1', 'would', 'mean', 'bit', 'had', 'be', 'trimmed', 'top', 'bottom', 'fill', 'screen', 'could', ""n't"", 'notice', 'anything', 'missing', 'are', 'two', 'soundtracks', 'Italian', 'English', 'chose', 'listen', 'Italian', 'optional', 'English', 'subtitles', 'subtitles', 'are', 'easy', 'read', 'found', 'going', 'back', 'few', 'times', 're-read', 'went', 'too', 'fast', 'small', 'price', 'pay', 'always', 'prefer', 'original', 'language', 'get', 'proper', 'feel', 'film', 'DVD', 'also', 'interviews', 'director', 'Nello', 'Rossati', 'brother', 'Tony', 'costume', 'designer', 'trailer', 'poster', 'still', 'photo', 'gallery', 'informative', '8', 'page', 'booklet', 'norm', 'Shame', 'releases', 'rarity', 'days.As', 'booklet', 'states', 'Sensuous', 'Nurse', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'mistaken', 'remarkable', 'film', 'have', 'charms', 'wholeheartedly', 'agree', 'not', 'classic', 'Fellini', 'Antonioni', 'film', 'lot', 'fun', 'enough', 'laughs', 'amusements', 'bring', 'smile', 'face']",N/A
