The humans are starting to shake off their dependence on the Taelons and the Taelons are themselves in serious trouble. As always, many of the better shows end up being axed and the crappy ones seem to go on forever. Sad that, unlike the original Star Trek, EFC did not continue on in syndication. There is one bad thing. The packaging of the discs is a very poor design. The discs ore overlaying each other and the case does not hold them secure. As a result, the DVDs fall out of the case and slide around each other, thus risking the chance of being scratched. Not sure who the Einstein was that designed this case, but they should have been kicked in the backside for this poor desin. If you are thinking of getting season five, as well, be advised the DVDs are packaged in the same style.",5,Trekvery good series.,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,897,"['Even', 'already', 'knowing', 'series', 'was', 'canceled', 'do', 'get', 'feeling', 'end', 'was', 'near', 'humans', 'are', 'starting', 'shake', 'off', 'dependence', 'Taelons', 'Taelons', 'are', 'serious', 'trouble', 'always', 'many', 'better', 'shows', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'axed', 'crappy', 'ones', 'seem', 'go', 'forever', 'Sad', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'EFC', 'did', 'not', 'continue', 'syndication', 'one', 'bad', 'thing', 'packaging', 'discs', 'very', 'poor', 'design', 'discs', 'overlaying', 'other', 'case', 'not', 'hold', 'secure', 'result', 'DVDs', 'fall', 'case', 'slide', 'around', 'other', 'thus', 'risking', 'chance', 'being', 'scratched', 'Not', 'sure', 'who', 'Einstein', 'was', 'designed', 'case', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'kicked', 'backside', 'poor', 'desin', 'are', 'thinking', 'getting', 'season', 'five', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'advised', 'DVDs', 'are', 'packaged', 'same', 'style']",Earth: Final Conflict - Season Four

1367633,A2Z0I41FWHXEC5,B003VPX5XA,Dawn Calkins,"[0, 0]","Although none of the actors were familiar to me, they were superb.  The series concept was well-thought out and the sets and special effects were great.  Often, sci-fi movies/series can be cheesy with substandard music and dialogue, but it's easy to get caught up in and remain fascinated by this series.  What's really good is that since there so many different plots going on in the series, the intro to each episode connects what's about to be shown with what has already transpired in that plot line.  Each season continues the same high quality.",5,Believeable series,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,550,"['none', 'actors', 'were', 'familiar', 'were', 'superb', 'series', 'concept', 'was', 'well-thought', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'Often', 'sci-fi', 'movies/series', 'can', 'be', 'cheesy', 'substandard', 'music', 'dialogue', 'easy', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'remain', 'fascinated', 'series', 'What', 'really', 'good', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'plots', 'going', 'series', 'intro', 'episode', 'what', 'be', 'shown', 'what', 'already', 'transpired', 'plot', 'line', 'season', 'same', 'high', 'quality']",Earth: Final Conflict - Season Four
