While being constructed, his programming was tampered with making him 'incomplete' thus needing human assistance.  He is aided in his quest by a genius scientist (Mike Farrell) but at the same time hunted by other scientists (headed by John Vernon)  who are bent on exploiting the technology or destroying the android.

1590077,A1Q6PG0Y3XZL7M,B009AGEZ8S,"Book & Music thief, from HI","[0, 0]","I was too young to understand this film, when it was first broadcast in 1974 - it had been another of Gene Roddenberry's post-Classic Star Trek projects.  He had a few others before this, trying to recapture the magically inspired creativity & high quality of that ground-breaking show from the mid-1960's!I honestly believe that with ""The Questor Tapes"" Roddenberry finally achieved that very high level of imaginative Science/Speculative Fiction again!!I don't remember this on first broad-cast, and it wasn't until about 1980 (in junior high), that I read a fine article about this 'Lost' tele-Film (that almost became a weekly 'series'), in the pages of the great 'Starlog' magazine - and soon after, I saw a re-broadcast shown in the early 1980's.But watching the film again recently, I am amazed at how current, and prescient this story/ scenario seems = about a highly complex/ incredibly advanced form of artificial intelligence, that becomes very 'human' like during the course of this film - hinting and leading to the ultimate question of what really makes us 'human' in the first place.  And at what point, after the 'artificial' intelligence/ autonomous being accumulates & assimilates all of our acquired knowledge (and even begins to understand the underpinnings of our emotional 'stimuli') = will it ever achieve the right to be called 'human'?!Now, of course, this single film certainly does not answer the above question, but it is presented in such an intelligent & compelling manner, that the viewer can't help but at least begin to contemplate such things - and I am sure Roddenberry's plan was to further explore these intriguing concepts, in a future series.Unfortunately, this was not meant to be - as Roddenberry was much too independent minded to go along with Studio honchos, who wanted to turn this into another 'action' oriented six-million dollar/Bionic man type show (i.e. flexing the mechanical muscle!)Once again, they didn't think the general audiences would go for the 'cerebral' original concept (that's also what they said about Star Trek, at first).In any event, what we are left with is one of the most imaginative, intriguing, and even topical Television Speculative Fiction Movies, ever produced!  And I'm really glad they issued this DVD (with a nice/clean print, as well, not re-mastered but looks good!)post-note:  There is an additional very intriguing 'Big-Scale' concept introduced within this story, perhaps inspired by one of Asimov's great Novels - but I certainly won't give it away, now!!",5,"Authentic 'LOST TREASURE' perhaps the Best Television SciFi film, Ever!!!",1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,2540,"['was', 'too', 'young', 'understand', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', '1974', 'had', 'been', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'post-Classic', 'Star', 'Trek', 'projects', 'had', 'few', 'others', 'trying', 'recapture', 'magically', 'inspired', 'creativity', 'high', 'quality', 'ground-breaking', 'show', 'mid-1960', 'honestly', 'believe', 'Questor', 'Tapes', 'Roddenberry', 'finally', 'achieved', 'very', 'high', 'level', 'imaginative', 'Science/Speculative', 'Fiction', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'first', 'broad-cast', 'was', ""n't"", '1980', 'junior', 'high', 'read', 'fine', 'article', ""'Lost"", 'tele-Film', 'almost', 'became', 'weekly', ""'series"", 'pages', 'great', ""'Starlog"", 'magazine', 'soon', 'saw', 're-broadcast', 'shown', 'early', ""1980's.But"", 'watching', 'film', 'again', 'recently', 'am', 'amazed', 'how', 'current', 'prescient', 'story/', 'scenario', '=', 'highly', 'complex/', 'incredibly', 'advanced', 'form', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'very', ""'human"", 'course', 'film', 'hinting', 'leading', 'ultimate', 'question', 'what', 'really', 'first', 'place', 'what', 'point', ""'artificial"", 'intelligence/', 'autonomous', 'being', 'accumulates', 'acquired', 'knowledge', 'even', 'understand', 'underpinnings', 'emotional', ""'stimuli"", '=', 'will', 'ever', 'achieve', 'right', 'be', 'called', ""'human"", 'Now', 'course', 'single', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'answer', 'above', 'question', 'presented', 'such', 'intelligent', 'compelling', 'manner', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'least', 'begin', 'contemplate', 'such', 'things', 'am', 'sure', 'Roddenberry', 'plan', 'was', 'further', 'explore', 'intriguing', 'concepts', 'future', 'series.Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'Roddenberry', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'independent', 'minded', 'go', 'along', 'Studio', 'honchos', 'who', 'wanted', 'turn', ""'action"", 'oriented', 'six-million', 'dollar/Bionic', 'man', 'type', 'show', 'i.e', 'flexing', 'mechanical', 'muscle', 'Once', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'general', 'audiences', 'would', 'go', ""'cerebral"", 'original', 'concept', 'also', 'what', 'said', 'Star', 'Trek', 'first', '.In', 'event', 'what', 'are', 'left', 'one', 'most', 'imaginative', 'intriguing', 'even', 'topical', 'Television', 'Speculative', 'Fiction', 'Movies', 'ever', 'produced', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'issued', 'DVD', 'nice/clean', 'print', 'as', 'well', 'not', 're-mastered', 'good', 'post-note', 'additional', 'very', 'intriguing', ""'Big-Scale"", 'concept', 'introduced', 'story', 'perhaps', 'inspired', 'one', 'Asimov', 'great', 'Novels', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'now']",The Questor Tapes

1590086,A121660P9WJSER,B009AGEZ8S,"Hose Nose ""B-film buff""","[1, 1]","Gene Roddenberry & Gene Coon, creative team behind the original Star Trek series, teamed up again for this 90min pilot movie for a series about an advanced android. Calling himself Questor, the machine man is forced to seek out his mysterious creator when a sizable portion of his initial programming files are accidentally destroyed by a handful of the scientists who try to decode the highly advanced data prior to uploading it into Questor's memory banks. Without a complete set of instructions and full knowledge of who and what he is, Questor is forced to put his trust in the only scientist who didn't try to decode the data with the others. Together, they must solve the mystery of Questor's creator, and find him before the nuclear power source in the andriod's chest detonates! The power source doubling as part of it's self defense programming, in order to prevent it from accidentally falling into the wrong hands and being turned into a weapon.Robert Foxworth (Falcon Crest) and Mike Farrell (M*A*S*H) have terrific chemistry together and play off of each other very well. The make-up effects for the android are pretty cool for a 1972 TV movie budget. The entire sequence of Questor prepping himself to leave the laboratory complex for his initial journey to uncover his creator's whereabouts is fascinating. The script, in typical Roddenberry fashion, is fun, well-written sci-fi that incorporates much of the same qualities that Star Trek TOS always had: a profound belief in the basic goodness of mankind and in his ability to overcome his baser self and triumph over adversity in a continuing quest to better himself and the world around him. Sure, this might seem rather heavy-handed & preachy in today's cynical, overly suspicious world, but it's these keystone beliefs that have guided Trek ideology for almost 5 decades and helped it endure thru all of it's various incarnations.The disc is an on-demand DVD-r release from Universal Studio's Vault Series, which are much in the same vein as on-demand product from Warner Bros. Archives, Sony Pictures Choice Collection and MGM Limited Edition. As a DVD-r, that means the disc has ZERO extra features; just the film itself. I don't think it even has closed captioning. Still, it is a pretty rare movie and I was just thrilled to see it get any kind of release at all. The picture & sound quality are quite good for a made-for-TV movie that hasn't seen the light of day in years. I only saw this movie one time, (on a late-night movie viewing I think), many, many years ago as a young boy. But it must have made an impression on me, as many parts of it stuck with me, though I must confess I'd forgotten as much as I remembered. The movie is certainly good enough to warrant repeat viewings. So in closing, let me say that THE QUESTOR TAPES is a very well done, entertaining movie that would have made a very cool sereis. Who knows, perhaps it was just too far ahead of its time?

This is one that we enjoyed watching when it first aired and were not happy that it did not get made into a series. By today's standards, it is dated in terms of technology and FX, but it is still worth adding to one's collection, along with the original series. The four star rating is largely because it is what I consider a valuable addition to my collection, but the overall quality is more along the lines of three stars.A word about the production values of this disc -- it is a &#34;vault&#34; disc, not intended for high sales, and as such, similar to those produced by Warner and Disney, done on an as ordered basis. Generally speaking, the quality is fine and the discs will play on most players, but there are some instances where a player will not play a written disc (rather than a commercially-produced pressed disc).
