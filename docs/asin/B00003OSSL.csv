Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 7]","For those of you out there that have completely destroyed this film with your words, I suggest revisiting Random Hearts post-9/11.  While I hate to use that dreadful moment in our history as a staple for this review, one cannot help but consider the connections and possibilities between the fictitious story of this film and those unthinkable WTC events.  Director Sydney Pollack has done a fabulous job of adapting a story that is both suspenseful, creative, and full of human emotion.  He did a superb job of casting both Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott-Thomas who engulf these sinister characters and bring that much-needed emotion to the screen.  His music seems cheesy at times, yet draws you into some scenes the next.  With all of these great elements coming together for Random Hearts, why is it that so many people have rated this film low?  My response to that has to do with seeing this film in a completely different light.  There were elements that I thought were brilliant, yet needed to have some thought involved.  Harrison Ford was one of these elements, as well as Pollack's use of airports throughout the film.  Let me explain.I saw Harrison Ford as this very evil character in this film.  Perhaps this was not the tone that Pollack was hoping to create with Random Hearts, but it was what I witnessed when I watched it.  When you watch it, see if you see it as well.  Throughout the film Ford pushes Thomas into what he wants.  He invades her life, rummages through her personal moments, and even seduces her to discover more information.  He is the one most hurt by this disaster, and it turns him dark.  While most will argue that the event brought these two hearts together, I think Ford's character was weaker than we imagined.  He needed that comfort level that his wife provided and found it with Thomas.  He wasn't going to stop until he was with her and found out everything he could about his cheating wife.  Ford was creepy to me in this film.  While I think Kristin Scott-Thomas did an outstanding job countering this insanity that Ford brought with him, it was really Ford that captured the aura of the film.  Thomas was like a child being lead throughout the mall by her determined father.  Broken, hurt, destroyed, and even paranoid were all elements that were creeping into Ford's life, and he had no clue how to handle them, so he attached himself to Thomas ... perhaps more than he should have.Take Ford's powerful character and Thomas' weakened version of Kay and throw in Pollack's mastermind and you honestly have an amazing film.  The scenes that really blew my mind in this film were how Pollack continually brought Ford and Thomas back into the airport.  It was because of an airport that these two random strangers met, now throughout the film, they have some of their toughest moments back in that same airport.  When they return of Miami sparks a new chapter for both of them, the scene where they both are flying, but cannot be seen together was beautifully awkward and dark, then at the end when they meet together for the climax, it felt a bit stalker-ish to me.  Ford was spooky, nearly saying that he cannot continue life without Thomas' comfort.  His final speech was supposed to be happy, but to me came across as very wimpy and boarding on lunacy.  It was amazing.While the background stories seem to mesh well, I honestly could have done with less of Thomas' story of trying to win an election, and pushed more of Ford's story of how the loss of his wife was destroying his career.  I thought this was a really interesting segway that should have been explored more.  I wanted to see the fall of Ford, and I think he was just about there.  I wanted to see him break down and really turn into this Hitchcockian character.  I wanted to really see him corrupt his life because his persistence on detail created this flawed marriage.  There was so much more that should have been done with Ford's character, that I was continually biting my nails hoping that Pollack would take that Requiem for a Dream direction.  Alas, he did not, I am not sure if it was because he was trying to attract a different audience or what, but Pollack had a dark film on his hands, sadly, he just didn't push that envelope that far.Overall, as odd that this may sound, I was impressed with this film.  I believe this was one of those rare Hollywood instances where they had the chance to really scare us with some backwards characters, but instead changed to this high road of ""romance"" and ""drama"".  I saw this film as a very disturbing film thanks to the work of Harrison Ford.  I am not sure if this was the direction either he or Pollack saw the film going, but it is what I experienced in my viewing.  I really suggest you go back and see this film with its darker undertones.  I may be pulling this out of nowhere, but to me Ford was spooky, Thomas was this pushover that Ford manipulated, and Pollack had a masterpiece before his time.  Random Hearts was an unexpected film that I cannot wait to watch again!Grade: **** out of *****",4,You keep looking for a reason why.

Kristin Scott Thomas is a congresswoman and the betrayed wife.Neither of them is aware of the spousal cheating until there is a plane crash at the beginning of the film. Ford and Thomas have never met. When Ford realizes that his wife booked a seat on the doomed plane, yet there is no mention of her on the manifest, he knows the fear of a husband who dreads the truth. The airlines keeps telling him his wife was not on any of their planes. He is sure that she was (being a cop and all). The congresswoman's husband told her he was flying to New York, but the airlines has his wallet from their downed plane in the Chesapeake Bay that was headed to Miami.Ford gets a copy of the manifest and starts circling suspicious couples and where they sat on the plane.His search for his wife and what he now realizes is a man she was most likely having an affair with, becomes a thrilling search for clue after clue. When Ford finally confronts Thomas that her husband was having an affair with Ford's wife, she doesn't want to discuss it. ""It's over,"" she says. ""He's through with her; she's through with him; and we're through with both of them.""At the same time, there are two sub-plots happening with Ford working in Internal Affairs trying to nail a bad cop, and Thomas trying to win an election in spite of her husband's death. Finally, the two trade information and near the end run off to the country to heal their wounds by turning to each other.This was Sydney Pollack's last Directorial effort. I have always thought he was a genius, having directed Out of Africa, The Way We Were, Tootsie, and so many other great films. I personally think this film is brilliant. Mr.Pollack delves into the feelings of rage and anger that surface as the two betrayed people learn more and more about their spouses. Things they never knew, never had a clue. Discovering how blind they had been is brought to the screen with so much subtlety,it digs at the strongest emotions in our hearts. There is a certain suspense throughout the film that kept me riveted. Two people, strangers, alone, and tortured by a truth that tries to undo them. See for yourself how they survive this tragedy.",5,I love this film.

The lighting, music and slow pacing only accentuate the melacholy mood of the film.  I love depressing movies-music too.  There's no escaping the truth for these characters.  It's painful.  Betrayal always is-eventually.  If you don't like depressing stuff, this movie will turn you off-even if you like the leads.  Pollack's direction is perfect for the material-something I imagine he did on purpose.  This is adult material-it's just that adults don't usually like to deal with difficult issues.The two weak points of the film are the side story and the romance.

While the film tends to drag, and never quite meshes together, Ford's  performance is one of the finest of his career. With his patented  'hang-dog' expression, his spikey gray hair, and his increasing sense of  bewilderment over the failure of his 'perfect' marriage, he delivers a  beautifully defined portrayal of a man cut adrift, and was certainly worthy  of Oscar consideration.As the other betrayed spouse, Kristen Scott  Thomas is less successful, partially because she never seems as romantically  involved with her husband (Peter Cayote), to begin with. She struggles with  a role that has far less emotional depth than she had in 'The Horse  Whisperer', and ultimately, she falls back on mannerisms to fill in what  the script lacks. There isn't a lot of chemistry between the leads, either;  a scene in her car, when she and Ford explosively embrace, is the only  sexually-charged scene they share; their subsequent love scenes seems flat,  and by-the-numbers, which strains the credibility of their attraction.In supporting roles, director Sidney Pollack, Charles Dutton, and Bonnie  Hunt are very good; Hunt's restaurant scene with Thomas, when she  acknowledges her affair with the husband, is a high point in the film.While Random Hearts will not be everyone's 'cup of tea', if you're a  Harrison Ford fan, this film should definitely be in your collection!",3,Ford Scores in Romantic Drama,951523200,"02 26, 2000",2000,1814,"['Random', 'Hearts', 'will', 'get', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'who', 'romance', 'core', 'film', ""n't"", 'focus', 'much', 'story', 'most', 'film', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'police', 'detective', 'trying', 'juggle', 'investigation', 'running', 'crooked', 'cop', 'putting', 'together', 'pieces', 'wife', 'affair', 'politician', 'husband', 'light', 'couple', 'are', 'killed', 'plane', 'crash', 'film', 'drag', 'never', 'quite', 'together', 'Ford', 'performance', 'one', 'finest', 'career', 'patented', ""'hang-dog"", 'expression', 'spikey', 'gray', 'hair', 'increasing', 'sense', 'bewilderment', 'failure', ""'perfect"", 'marriage', 'beautifully', 'defined', 'portrayal', 'man', 'cut', 'adrift', 'was', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'consideration.As', 'other', 'betrayed', 'spouse', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'less', 'successful', 'partially', 'never', 'romantically', 'involved', 'husband', 'Peter', 'Cayote', 'begin', 'role', 'far', 'less', 'emotional', 'depth', 'had', ""'The"", 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'ultimately', 'back', 'mannerisms', 'fill', 'what', 'script', ""n't"", 'lot', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'either', 'scene', 'car', 'when', 'Ford', 'explosively', 'embrace', 'only', 'sexually-charged', 'scene', 'share', 'subsequent', 'love', 'scenes', 'flat', 'by-the-numbers', 'credibility', 'attraction.In', 'supporting', 'roles', 'director', 'Sidney', 'Pollack', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Hunt', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'Thomas', 'when', 'affair', 'husband', 'high', 'point', 'film.While', 'Random', 'Hearts', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', ""'cup"", 'tea', ""'re"", 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'fan', 'film', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'collection']",N/A

His face looks like it is carved in stone throughout the movie, no smiles, no sorrow, no happiness, just a death mask. His wife, and a congresswoman's husband die together in a plane crash. It turns out that they were having an affair. The bereft husband (Ford) and wife (Thomas) sort of fall in love. You sit through this movie constantly wondering why anyone would fall for the wooden Harrison Ford. Don't get me wrong, I like Harrison Ford, but in this flick his affectless performance makes John Wayne seem like Jerry Lewis.So there you have it, a totally uninteresting romance. This is one movie where you do not see the newly in love couple romping through a flowery meadow. In fact it would be more likely to have Scott take Ford to a mortuary and have him embalmed.Realizing that the audience will probably doze off from time to time, the director periodically livens things up by having Ford, a police officer, punch somebody out or threaten to kill someone. So that's it, a policeman with total face paralysis takes up with a Republican (in case that matters to you) Congresswoman and they do things together. What things? Well you know, sit on a park bench and eat sandwiches, fondle each other in a car, ransack the apartment where their ex spouses would have their trysts. Finally, the movie doesn't end; it just dies.Oh, I might add that if you go to the Rotten Tomatoes web site you'll find that only 13% of the top critics found Random Hearts to be an interesting movie.

After all, Sabrina (another Pollack and Ford film) was a delightful love story.  Sadly, Random Hearts was not.The movie started out interesting enough...Harrison Ford plays the role of tough Washington DC Internal Affairs cop, Dutch Van Den Broeck whose wife perishes in a terrible plane crash along side of a man who turns out to be the husband of Kay Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas), a Congresswoman running for re-election.  When Dutch comes to the realization that his wife was having an affair, he begins to hound Kay in an attempt to bring closure for himself.  He doesn't understand the affair or the why's of it and spends the entire movie looking hopelessly for explanations that only his wife could have given him.Kay pushes him away for awhile refusing to talk.  But then, for no apparent reason, she drops the ""I'll call the cops if you come near me again"" faade and follows him to Miami (the destination their spouses were heading to before the plane went down).  There are some good scenes filmed in this portion of the movie.  Dutch goes to the hotel his wife and Kay's husband had stayed on previous trips.  He enters the room that they had always occupied and the camera focuses meaningfully on the bed and the comfortably large tub.  The implied imagery is very powerful.  But then after the trip, without any sort of real lead-in, Dutch and Kay are suddenly very close and have the violent make-out scene in the car.  Hence, the strange and somewhat twisted romance between the two begins.Throughout the rest of the film, the feelings that Kay has towards Dutch seem oddly out of place.  She had been so adamantly against him...even uncaring, and now suddenly she's completely wrapped up him.  Can't get him out of her mind, wants to be with him, etc.  But it's all too fast...none of this really feels plausible.  Meanwhile, Dutch has this whole other life going on in Law Enforcement Land where he's chasing down and beating up dirty cops and making threats on people.  Frankly, this didn't need to be in there at all.  The story's ending is sort of drawn from this, but not necessarily because it had to be.  This movie could have finished out a dozen different and more ""touching"" ways, but instead it ended leaving everyone a bit frustrated.Ford's performance was fine given the character, but this was not the best role for him...and not a role I think most would enjoy him in.  He pulled off the part about as well as he could, but the character was too obsessive over his late-wife's affair for anybody to feel comfortable about it.  Kristin Scott Thomas fit her character well and did a commendable job, especially in scenes with her daughter.  The character's only major flaw was what came across as almost pathetic neediness when she was with Dutch.  Neither part was particularly likable.The story is captivating enough to keep you interested for about the first hour.  After that, you might find yourself wondering when it will end.

It had a great director, a bona fide superstar as leading man, a terrific female lead and an interesting premise for the story. The beginning of the film is  masterful. The spouses of two air crash victims go about the routines of  their lives as the news of the disaster creeps into the fringes of their  consciousness. As most of us do, they regard the news with a disconnected  interest, another news story about strangers dying. Suddenly, it occurs to  Dutch (Harrison Ford) that his wife said she was going to Miami and he  discovers two awful truths, that she was killed and that she was traveling  with another man. He then informs the wife of that man that her husband was  on the plane. The treatment of this entire chain of events was  extraordinarily well done.Unfortunately, after this the story bogs down  and becomes highly contrived. Dutch then becomes obsessed with knowing  everything about the illicit relationship. This is almost believable. But  he also drags Kay, (Kristin Scott Thomas) into the vortex and they develop  this complicated relationship of grief, passion and maybe even love. Not so  believable.The microscopic character study that ensues of the complex  emotions and reactions of the characters is well done, but the viewers find  themselves wondering why they have to watch it since most sane people would  just have let it go. After all, the offenders are dead, and little is to be  gained by knowing the details of the betrayal.The story also introduces  a completely superfluous subplot about the pursuit of a crooked cop by  Dutch, a detective in internal affairs. The only distant connection to the  plot is the fact that Kay and Dutch are together during the shootout with  the bad cop.As filmmaking, this film is first rate as would be expected  from Sydney Pollack. The color and exposures were particularly rich and the  scenes compelling. I particularly liked the scenes from the tango  nightclub. There were a broad range of different settings and situations  and all were handled with great realism.Harrison Ford was asked to play  a character quite different from his customary strong, direct and dynamic  roles. This character was far more complex than any he ever attempted and  Ford didn't have the range necessary to give a satisfying performance. He  was fine in the cop scenes, but in the scenes with Kristin Scott Thomas he  was overly subdued, almost like he was medicated. This made his performance  seem lifeless.Kristin Scott Thomas, on the other had was brilliant. She  showed incredible command of all the myriad emotional states that Kay  sustained. As a British actress playing an American, her accent was  flawless, though the character being from New Hampshire should have had a  New England accent.Overall, I gave this film a 7/10. Despite the plot  flaws, it was well constructed and as a character study it was excellent.  Most viewers will find such in-depth character studies slow and boring, so  if you are looking for pace, you might want to pass on this film.",3,Complex slow moving character study,956102400,"04 19, 2000",2000,3099,"['film', 'started', 'out', 'everything', 'producer', 'could', 'hope', 'had', 'great', 'director', 'bona', 'fide', 'superstar', 'leading', 'man', 'terrific', 'female', 'lead', 'interesting', 'premise', 'story', 'beginning', 'film', 'masterful', 'spouses', 'two', 'air', 'crash', 'victims', 'go', 'routines', 'lives', 'news', 'disaster', 'fringes', 'consciousness', 'most', 'do', 'regard', 'news', 'disconnected', 'interest', 'news', 'story', 'strangers', 'dying', 'Suddenly', 'Dutch', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'wife', 'said', 'was', 'going', 'Miami', 'two', 'awful', 'truths', 'was', 'killed', 'was', 'traveling', 'man', 'then', 'wife', 'man', 'husband', 'was', 'plane', 'treatment', 'entire', 'chain', 'events', 'was', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'done.Unfortunately', 'story', 'bogs', 'down', 'highly', 'contrived', 'Dutch', 'then', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'knowing', 'everything', 'illicit', 'relationship', 'almost', 'believable', 'also', 'Kay', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'vortex', 'develop', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'grief', 'passion', 'maybe', 'even', 'love', 'Not', 'so', 'believable.The', 'microscopic', 'character', 'study', 'ensues', 'complex', 'emotions', 'reactions', 'characters', 'well', 'done', 'viewers', 'find', 'wondering', 'why', 'have', 'watch', 'most', 'sane', 'people', 'would', 'just', 'have', 'let', 'go', 'offenders', 'are', 'dead', 'little', 'be', 'gained', 'knowing', 'details', 'betrayal.The', 'story', 'also', 'completely', 'superfluous', 'subplot', 'pursuit', 'crooked', 'cop', 'Dutch', 'detective', 'internal', 'affairs', 'only', 'distant', 'connection', 'plot', 'fact', 'Kay', 'Dutch', 'are', 'together', 'shootout', 'bad', 'cop.As', 'filmmaking', 'film', 'first', 'rate', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'color', 'exposures', 'were', 'particularly', 'rich', 'scenes', 'compelling', 'particularly', 'liked', 'scenes', 'tango', 'nightclub', 'were', 'broad', 'range', 'different', 'settings', 'situations', 'were', 'handled', 'great', 'realism.Harrison', 'Ford', 'was', 'asked', 'play', 'character', 'quite', 'different', 'customary', 'strong', 'direct', 'dynamic', 'roles', 'character', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'ever', 'attempted', 'Ford', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'range', 'necessary', 'give', 'satisfying', 'performance', 'was', 'fine', 'cop', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'was', 'overly', 'subdued', 'almost', 'was', 'medicated', 'made', 'performance', 'seem', 'lifeless.Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'other', 'had', 'was', 'brilliant', 'showed', 'incredible', 'command', 'myriad', 'emotional', 'states', 'Kay', 'sustained', 'British', 'actress', 'playing', 'American', 'accent', 'was', 'flawless', 'character', 'being', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'New', 'England', 'accent.Overall', 'gave', 'film', '7/10', 'plot', 'flaws', 'was', 'well', 'constructed', 'character', 'study', 'was', 'excellent', 'Most', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'such', 'in-depth', 'character', 'studies', 'slow', 'boring', 'so', 'are', 'looking', 'pace', 'might', 'want', 'pass', 'film']",N/A

For those who thought that it wasn't  the plot that is important, but rather the emotions and characterizations  created by two excellent actors, I also agree.  As I'm a little in both  camps, I guess that means I thought the movie was a little dragged out but  that the emotions on display were on the money.  Or, to put it another way,  I admired the movie more than enjoyed it.  I think that is how I feel,  but... this was a strange film.  So who knows how I will feel tomorrow?  Here is one more example of the strangeness:  did anyone else notice the  subversive little theme running under the surface, namely the idea that  affairs are okay as long they don't become serious?  Ford's character is  comforted by a former co-worker of his dead wife, who tried to make him  feel better by saying that she, too, caught her spouse in an affair when  she went home for lunch unexpectedly one day.  But she never confronted her  husband about it because she herself was having an affair at the same time.  &quot;There was nothing wrong in our relationship,&quot; she went on.  &quot;I guess we both just wanted to have a little fun and excitement in  our routine lives, and it would be a sad thing if people had to give up the  thrill of new adventures just because they're settled in a marriage.&quot;  And later, when the Congresswoman's daughter finds out about her dead  father's infidelity, she wonders aloud, &quot;Was it serious?&quot;  Which  implies that if the affair wasn't &quot;serious&quot;, then maybe it wasn't  something to cry over as much.  Interesting, interesting.  I also agree  with other reviewers that the crooked cop subplot really had nothing to do  with the rest of the story.  I think I DID see its true purpose, however.  The cop storyline, which surfaced for a minute or two once ever twenty  minutes or so, functioned as a sort of badly-needed intermission from the  grim proceedings that made up the rest of the movie.  During the cop  subplot scenes, we got to see the old Harrison Ford, the one we LIKE to  see- punching a guy, delivering a tough line or two, acting intense, and  pointing his gun- before we had to go back for another bunch of scenes  detailing the grim, serious stuff.  I'm still deciding if this film is a  refreshing change from usual Hollywood fare- namely a challenging drama- or  an interesting failure. I will say this; the movie IS worth seeing.

Most romances are made good because of the chemistry between the two leads. Here the opposite is true, Ford and Scott-Thomas are anything but perfect for each other, and their personality conflicts make for pretty compelling drama despite stilted dialogue. They process the tragedy quite differently, and true to the spirit of the film, nothing is really resolved. They both end-up with a tenous grip on the reality of what happened. They took what they needed from each other, and benefitted from the relationship they managed to carve out of their mutual heartbreak. Anything more will have to wait. It''s refreshing to see that all was not repaired by the end titles.The performances were wonderfully understated, Harrison Ford only does his trademark angry yell once and opts to be brooding and broken instead.The score is a delight.Rent ""Random Hearts"" its a film that offers no easy answers and that is rare today.Also, it deserves extra points for winning me over despite the fact I was expecting an entirely different premise.

545798,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003OSSL,Matthew Horner,"[2, 4]","Oh, how I looked forward to this movie before is was released. Two of my favorite stars and one of my favorite directors. Who could ask for more? As it turns out, I could ask for a lot more.Random Hearts starts off well. Dutch Van Der Broeek [Harrison Ford] and Kay Chandler [Kristin Scott Thomas] have never met. Their spouses certainly have. They are having an affair. One morning they take a flight to Miami. Dutch and Kay are worry-free, because they have not been told the truth. So when the plane crashes shortly after takeoff , killing everyone on board, Dutch and Kay go about their mundane daily business. News reports flash everywhere, but what has it to do with them? Everything, as it turns out.Dutch is an undercover policeman, and when he finds out his wife was traveling under the name of Mrs. Peyton Chandler, he goes on a quest to find out about the length and duration of the affair. At first, Kay, who is a Congresswoman running for reelection, wants nothing to do with him. After much persistence, she joins him on a search for answers that can never be found. Along the way, they also fall for each other.Random Hearts is probably a well-meaning attempt at examining the grief process. It has so many problems that that examination never works. For one thing, this is one of the grimmest, most humorless movies I have seen in a long, long time. I should think that a veteran director like Sidney Pollock would know that, when the subject is heavy, you've got to crack a joke or two along the way to relieve the audience's stress. At least there should be a couple of characters who doesn't need Prozac. This is especially true about a movie that runs nearly two and a half hours.I think the intention was to make the film poignant. Harrison Ford's performance prevents its becoming this. He is unbelievably awkward in his love scenes with Kristin Scott Thomas. I can't imagine that he's a bad lover, so I can only assume that this was his interpretation of the character. His sour-faced, awkward attempts at intimacy make it hard to believe that Kaye would want him much, if at all. Scott Thomas handles her role with aplomb, although her English accent creeps in now and then.There is a subplot involving Dutch's undercover work. Except for a moment near the movie's climax, it has nothing to do with the plot. Sadly, it's a lot more interesting than the rest of the movie....",2,"Turgid, misguided look at the grieving process",1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,2398,"['Oh', 'how', 'looked', 'forward', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'Two', 'favorite', 'stars', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'Who', 'could', 'ask', 'more', 'out', 'could', 'ask', 'lot', 'more.Random', 'Hearts', 'off', 'well', 'Dutch', 'Van', 'Der', 'Broeek', '[', 'Harrison', 'Ford', ']', 'Kay', 'Chandler', '[', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', ']', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'spouses', 'certainly', 'have', 'are', 'having', 'affair', 'One', 'morning', 'take', 'flight', 'Miami', 'Dutch', 'Kay', 'are', 'worry-free', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'told', 'truth', 'So', 'when', 'plane', 'crashes', 'shortly', 'takeoff', 'killing', 'everyone', 'board', 'Dutch', 'Kay', 'go', 'mundane', 'daily', 'business', 'reports', 'flash', 'everywhere', 'do', 'Everything', 'out.Dutch', 'undercover', 'policeman', 'when', 'out', 'wife', 'was', 'traveling', 'name', 'Mrs.', 'Peyton', 'Chandler', 'quest', 'find', 'out', 'length', 'duration', 'affair', 'first', 'Kay', 'who', 'Congresswoman', 'running', 'reelection', 'nothing', 'do', 'much', 'persistence', 'search', 'answers', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'found', 'way', 'also', 'fall', 'other.Random', 'Hearts', 'probably', 'well-meaning', 'attempt', 'examining', 'grief', 'process', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'examination', 'never', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'grimmest', 'most', 'humorless', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'should', 'think', 'veteran', 'director', 'Sidney', 'Pollock', 'would', 'know', 'when', 'subject', 'heavy', ""'ve"", 'got', 'crack', 'joke', 'two', 'way', 'relieve', 'audience', 'stress', 'least', 'should', 'be', 'couple', 'characters', 'who', ""n't"", 'need', 'Prozac', 'especially', 'true', 'movie', 'nearly', 'two', 'half', 'hours.I', 'think', 'intention', 'was', 'make', 'film', 'poignant', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'performance', 'becoming', 'unbelievably', 'awkward', 'love', 'scenes', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'bad', 'lover', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'was', 'interpretation', 'character', 'sour-faced', 'awkward', 'attempts', 'intimacy', 'make', 'hard', 'believe', 'Kaye', 'would', 'want', 'much', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'role', 'aplomb', 'English', 'accent', 'creeps', 'now', 'then.There', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Dutch', 'undercover', 'work', 'moment', 'movie', 'climax', 'nothing', 'do', 'plot', 'Sadly', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'rest', 'movie']",N/A

Harrison Ford, Kristen Scott Thomas, Sydney Pollack, mystery, etc. I certainly understood that this was not the typical Harrison action film. No booming special effects,  no endless numbers of murders. However, what I didn't expect is that  nothing really happens. Yes, it is a mature subject. How would any of us  deal with not only the sudden death of a spouse but the discovery that said  spouse died along with her lover, also married? Harrison delivers the  shock, the rage and the desire to uncover the mystery quite well. At first.  Unfortunately, the writing and the dialogue never take it any further. He  just stays angry throughout the film. Kristin Scott Thomas plays a  potentially strong female character who really just reacts to everything  going on around her. Along with the main plot line, we see Harrison  uncovering police corruption in his job with Internal Affairs. I have to  say that this entire sequence contributed nothing to the overall film; it  was confusing, and it fizzled.It took me 2 days to watch all of  this film. I was determined to see it through to the end and kept thinking  that I just wasn't getting the deeper meaning and needed to give it a  chance. I have to agree with the critics though.

This was his job to appear that  way!I recall reading a review of his performance in &quot;Sabrina&quot;  - was said to have been 'cold, tired, unemotional, sick', etc.  Again, this  was HIS JOB. The script was written thusly - he was SUPPOSED to play a role  showing himself all these things, and he did a superb job at it!As for  the plot in Random Hearts, some reviewer complained about the various  sub-plots.  Doesn't every movie and TV show these days have several plots  running at the same time?  Confusing, to say the least, but it does make  you pay attention!

They showed us the struggle of two people who not only lost their spouses in a plane crash, but learned that these spouses had been cheating on both of them with each other.

545809,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003OSSL,Reviewer,"[13, 15]","Coping with the loss of a spouse is, of course, a traumatic experience;  but what would it be like to have to deal with such grief, only to have it  exacerbated by the revelation that your husband / wife was having an  affair?  Such is the situation for two people in ""Random Hearts,"" a drama  that explores pain and suffering, despair and obsession, and the sense of  isolation and need that overcomes Dutch Van Den Broeck (Harrison Ford) and  Kay Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas) in the wake of a tragic plane crash  that claims, respectively, his wife and her husband.  Director Sydney  Pollack weaves an intricate story that begins with the hint of the  indiscretion, is followed closely by the tragedy, then quickly escalates  into the discovery of the affair by Van Den Broeck, who subsequently  locates and contacts Chandler.  In what is essentially a character  study of how differently the parties involved respond to their grief, and  how the knowledge of the infidelity effects them individually, Pollack very  deliberately peals away the layers of emotion until the feelings of each  are laid bare and exposed.  Ultimately it becomes the story of their  relationship; of the intimate bond formed between these total strangers who  share this dark secret foisted upon them in such an unseemly manner.  He is  a cop; not only a cop, but an internal affairs cop in Washington, D.C.  It's his job to observe people and to notice situations, to know when  something is out of place or just not right.  Yet his own wife was having  an affair, and he didn't have a clue; and in dealing with his emotions, in  sorting it all out, he becomes obsessed with finding out everything.  Where  did they meet, when and how; how long had it been going on?  Who was he,  did they have a ""place"" of their own.  Where were they going on that  fateful day?  Adamant, he pushes himself to find the answers, while Kay  Chandler, a congresswoman up for reelection, wants nothing to do with it.  Dealing with it in her own way, she opts to pursue a more immediate form of  closure on her own, choosing to suppress her feelings while declining Van  Den Broeck's attempts to include her in his incessant investigation.  Unlike him, to deal with the pain and confusion, she has to move on.  She  doesn't want to know anything about the affair between her husband and his  wife, and not because she feels any less than he does; it's simply a matter  of doing what she must to cope, just as he is.  The difference:  He has to  know; she must not.  Ford does a more than capable job with an  emotionally charged, challenging role, using just enough restraint to make  the obsession into which he's channeled his feelings effective, keeping the  tone subtle rather than overblown and demonstrative.  Scott Thomas is  excellent as well, externalizing the predominately internal turmoil she is  experiencing with clarity and precision.  She succinctly conveys the depth  of her emotions, placing it all just above the surface so that it leaves  you with a strong sense of what is really raging just beneath.  There's a  definite connection established between Ford and Scott Thomas, but no real  chemistry; but then again, this isn't a romantic love story, but a story of  two people at loose ends helping one another cope with unique, unfathomable  circumstances.  The excellent supporting cast includes Charles Dutton  (Alcee), Bonnie Hunt (Wendy), Dennis Haysbert (Beaufort), Sydney Pollack  (Carl), Richard Jenkins (Truman), Paul Guilfoyle (Dick), Peter Coyote  (Cullen), Susanna Thompson (Peyton) and Dylan Baker (Richard).  ""Random  Hearts"" is a somber film that demonstrates just how vulnerable we all are,  and how life as we know it can change in an instant; a solid drama expertly  delivered by Pollack and an outstanding cast that leaves the indelible  impression that no matter what you think you know, the human heart will  forever remain a mystery to us all.",4,"Unique, Powerful Drama",968371200,"09 8, 2000",2000,3949,"['Coping', 'loss', 'spouse', 'course', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'deal', 'such', 'grief', 'only', 'have', 'exacerbated', 'revelation', 'husband', '/', 'wife', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'Such', 'situation', 'two', 'people', 'Random', 'Hearts', 'drama', 'pain', 'suffering', 'despair', 'obsession', 'sense', 'isolation', 'need', 'Dutch', 'Van', 'Den', 'Broeck', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Kay', 'Chandler', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'wake', 'tragic', 'plane', 'crash', 'respectively', 'wife', 'husband', 'Director', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'intricate', 'story', 'hint', 'indiscretion', 'followed', 'closely', 'tragedy', 'then', 'quickly', 'discovery', 'affair', 'Van', 'Den', 'Broeck', 'who', 'subsequently', 'Chandler', 'what', 'essentially', 'character', 'study', 'how', 'differently', 'parties', 'involved', 'respond', 'grief', 'how', 'knowledge', 'infidelity', 'effects', 'individually', 'Pollack', 'very', 'deliberately', 'peals', 'away', 'layers', 'emotion', 'feelings', 'are', 'laid', 'bare', 'exposed', 'Ultimately', 'story', 'relationship', 'intimate', 'bond', 'formed', 'total', 'strangers', 'who', 'share', 'dark', 'secret', 'foisted', 'unseemly', 'manner', 'cop', 'not', 'only', 'cop', 'internal', 'affairs', 'cop', 'Washington', 'D.C', 'job', 'observe', 'people', 'notice', 'situations', 'know', 'when', 'something', 'place', 'just', 'not', 'right', 'own', 'wife', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'dealing', 'emotions', 'sorting', 'out', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'out', 'everything', 'Where', 'did', 'meet', 'when', 'how', 'how', 'long', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'Who', 'was', 'did', 'have', 'place', 'own', 'Where', 'were', 'going', 'fateful', 'day', 'Adamant', 'find', 'answers', 'Kay', 'Chandler', 'congresswoman', 'up', 'reelection', 'nothing', 'do', 'Dealing', 'own', 'way', 'pursue', 'more', 'immediate', 'form', 'closure', 'own', 'choosing', 'suppress', 'feelings', 'declining', 'Van', 'Den', 'Broeck', 'attempts', 'include', 'incessant', 'investigation', 'deal', 'pain', 'confusion', 'move', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'anything', 'affair', 'husband', 'wife', 'not', 'less', 'simply', 'matter', 'doing', 'what', 'must', 'cope', 'just', 'difference', 'know', 'must', 'not', 'Ford', 'more', 'capable', 'job', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'challenging', 'role', 'using', 'just', 'enough', 'restraint', 'make', 'obsession', 'channeled', 'feelings', 'effective', 'keeping', 'tone', 'subtle', 'rather', 'overblown', 'demonstrative', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'externalizing', 'predominately', 'internal', 'turmoil', 'experiencing', 'clarity', 'precision', 'succinctly', 'conveys', 'depth', 'emotions', 'placing', 'just', 'surface', 'strong', 'sense', 'what', 'really', 'raging', 'just', 'beneath', 'definite', 'connection', 'established', 'Ford', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'real', 'chemistry', 'then', 'again', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'love', 'story', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'loose', 'ends', 'helping', 'one', 'cope', 'unique', 'unfathomable', 'circumstances', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'Alcee', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'Wendy', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'Beaufort', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'Carl', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Truman', 'Paul', 'Guilfoyle', 'Dick', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'Cullen', 'Susanna', 'Thompson', 'Peyton', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'Richard', 'Random', 'Hearts', 'somber', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'vulnerable', 'are', 'how', 'life', 'know', 'can', 'change', 'instant', 'solid', 'drama', 'expertly', 'delivered', 'Pollack', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'indelible', 'impression', 'matter', 'what', 'think', 'know', 'human', 'heart', 'will', 'forever', 'remain', 'mystery']",N/A

Kyle,"[1, 1]","Dutch (Harrison Ford) is a DC police sergeant detailed to Internal Affairs who discovers after a plane crash that his late wife was having an affair of her own. This leads him to Congresswoman Kay Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas) who is running for re-election and coping with the grief of learning her husband died on the plane crash as well.It seems Dutch's wife and Chandler's husband were flying together on that plane as man and wife.  As unlikely as that scenario is in post - 9/11 reality, it could have happened back in 1999 when Sidney Pollack first released the film.Being a cop, Dutch has to know the details of the affair.  He drags Kay reluctantly along with him and the two of them begin to feel the inevitable attraction.  Mostly the main plot of this story moves at a snail's pace.  More interesting is Dutch's investigation of Det. George Beaufort (Dennis Haysbert) for murder, which sadly takes a back seat.""Random Hearts"" is a must for Harrison Ford fans.

545813,A264UCDZZ6RLDN,B00003OSSL,Russell de Ville,"[2, 3]","Random Hearts was a difficult film for me to enjoy. It was so heart-wrenching to watch as two basically nice people are blind-sided by circumstance and painfully drawn to each other as if they had no other choice. It was not my notion of `fun.'Sydney Pollack's work seems to be well cast in both its primary and secondary roles. I'm a fan of most all these people. Harrison Ford is ""Dutch"" Van Den Broeck, a D.C. police sergeant with Internal Affairs. Kristin Scott Thomas is New Hampshire Congresswoman Kay Chandler. Charlie Dutton, Dennis Haysbert, Richard Jenkins, and Mr Pollack himself fill a few of the lesser and -- except for maybe Dutton as Alcee-mainly disinteresting roles. Outside of Alcee and Kay, it was difficult to care about anyone in this film.Despite the beautiful color, this is a film noir after the style of the 30s-50s. It does have more action and outdoor sequences which really require the color but, with some judicious re-writing, this could have been a brilliant piece in Black and White. The darkness of it all is emphasized by the arcane Jazz undertones in the musical score.Van Den Broeck's wife and Chandler's husband are killed in a plane crash. Apparently, they were on their way to Miami together and had probably done this before. There are more questions than answers as Dutch and Kay deal with the shock of their respective spouse's deaths. They contort emotionally with stunned, angry and hurt feelings within as they slowly unravel the affair.Both principals look for answers in their own way. Kay wants to drop it, forget it and move on, hopefully protecting her daughter and the dignity of her office along the way. Dutch would like to know more about the dead couple: how they met, their plans, their secretive interest in the Tango, etc.There are sub-plots that, for me, totally got in the way. The police story seems pointless but I suppose that it's necessary to balance with the equally banal re-election race. Both provide context and perhaps help to move the action along. Maybe they are also supposed to remind us that life continues, however roughed-up we might be.There are three lines that I find particularly significant. Two are made by Kay, the first when she goes to be with Dutch at his cabin on the inlet just off Chesapeake Bay:""I'm not going to make any small talk, `cause I don't want there to be  junk between us.""The second after Dutch is shot by a rogue cop (Haysbert) and lies in Hospital recovering:""We did OK Dutch. We did the best we could under the  circumstances.""The third line belongs to Dutch and is addressed to Kay earlier in the film:""What's the last thing that you remember about you and your  husband that you know was true?""Lines don't have to be magisterial to be meaningful. These are minimal but quite good. There are some others as well. (I'm also partial to ""Don't! Just Drive."")I know the movie ran a bit long but I think there should have been more footage in the forest. It was so lovely.After consultation with myself, Two Stars.

No, this is not some lightweight 'Six  Days Seven Nights' nonsense. It is a movie that understands all too well  the complex emotional and psychological torture that is the lot of the  betrayed spouses and how they interact with one another as a result.

Scott-Thomas is equally brilliant in her complex  role as the woman betrayed. The coming together of these two during the  horrible process of coming to grips with the depths of their respective  betrayals seems, to me, to be perfectly natural in that only each of them  could possibly truly understand the feelings of the other; this and the  realization of both of these faithful souls that they may indeed be a rare  breed in having practiced truth and fidelity in their marriages - and  lives.

I agree that this film is not meant for all types of audiences, as it has a very mature theme and only some people will actually get the story.Great performances from Harrison Ford as he displays a series of grief stricken scenes very different from his usual characters he has portrayed before.  Kristin Scott Thomas is brilliant as always in her performance as an ambitious congresswoman, yet trying to appear unmoved and cold as she learns of her husband's death and infidelity.  Scott Thomas is perfectly cast for this role and gives the film just the right amount of emotion in each scene she appears.  She literally steals the scene with her talent and her beauty.

If so, how serious were they? Can we intertwine a couple action sequences that have no  relevance to the movie so the preview looks good?I don't know exactly at  what point Harrison Ford decided his name was worth money, not good acting,  but I am convinced after Six Days, Seven Nights and Random Hearts that not  only is not exerting his talent as he used to, but also he cares less about  how foolish the script is.I miss the old Indiana, or even the good  intentioned Jack Ryan, anything but the stale, out-of-place performance the  consumer recieved from Ford in Random Hearts.I had high hopes in the  beginning, the noble and extreme officer who finds himself a widow and has  to deal with the confusion and regret of an affair mingled amongst tragedy.  Eventually developing into a moldy, mildly interesting at best, romance,  Ford battles bad guys while holding on to questions he can't seem to  answer.I'm very pleased with myself, because I almost paid $6.50 in  theatres to see this movie, hoping for a glimpse of the great Ford.  Instead, I saw his name, but he was nowhere present in the film (at least  not how I remember him). Granted, this is a drama, a romance, a different  type of character than the ones that made Ford famous. However, I simply  think he should never have been cast in this movie, I got severly tired of  seeing the only emotional face he could pull off, that cringed brow  expression he wears non stop. I have no doubt, Ford is not the serious  romantic actor he is now aspiring to be.(I know this is a one-faced  focus on Ford's performance, ignoring all other actors/actresses, but I  felt it was Ford's presence on the front of box that made this movie even  sell at all, therefore he became the focus of this review)",2,Ford's Talents live on in Name Only,952128000,"03 4, 2000",2000,1880,"['plane', 'crashed', 'plan', 'two', 'people', 'were', 'sitting', 'together', 'married', 'two', 'others', 'Were', 'lovers', 'so', 'how', 'serious', 'were', 'Can', 'intertwine', 'couple', 'action', 'sequences', 'have', 'relevance', 'movie', 'preview', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'point', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'decided', 'name', 'was', 'worth', 'money', 'not', 'good', 'acting', 'am', 'convinced', 'Six', 'Days', 'Seven', 'Nights', 'Random', 'Hearts', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'exerting', 'talent', 'used', 'also', 'less', 'how', 'foolish', 'script', 'is.I', 'miss', 'old', 'Indiana', 'even', 'good', 'intentioned', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'anything', 'stale', 'out-of-place', 'performance', 'consumer', 'recieved', 'Ford', 'Random', 'Hearts.I', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'beginning', 'noble', 'extreme', 'officer', 'who', 'widow', 'deal', 'confusion', 'regret', 'affair', 'mingled', 'amongst', 'tragedy', 'Eventually', 'developing', 'moldy', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'best', 'romance', 'Ford', 'bad', 'guys', 'holding', 'questions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'answer.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'pleased', 'almost', 'paid', '6.50', 'theatres', 'see', 'movie', 'hoping', 'glimpse', 'great', 'Ford', 'Instead', 'saw', 'name', 'was', 'nowhere', 'present', 'film', 'least', 'not', 'how', 'remember', 'Granted', 'drama', 'romance', 'different', 'type', 'character', 'ones', 'made', 'Ford', 'famous', 'However', 'simply', 'think', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'movie', 'got', 'severly', 'tired', 'seeing', 'only', 'emotional', 'face', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'cringed', 'brow', 'expression', 'non', 'stop', 'have', 'doubt', 'Ford', 'not', 'serious', 'romantic', 'actor', 'now', 'aspiring', 'be', 'know', 'one-faced', 'focus', 'Ford', 'performance', 'ignoring', 'other', 'actors/actresses', 'felt', 'was', 'Ford', 'presence', 'front', 'box', 'made', 'movie', 'even', 'sell', 'therefore', 'became', 'focus', 'review']",N/A

I kept being drawn back to the movie and have watched it several times. It probably has happened many times in real life in the same circumstances. Kristen Scott Thomas' character seemed willing to put her adulterous husband behind her because of 1)her daughter, 2) her very public position as a congresswoman and 3)maybe the relationship wasn't all that great to begin with.  The Harrison Ford character found it much more difficult to move on with his life because he ""didn't have a clue"" that his wife was cheating on him and he was paid as a policeman to know when people were lying to him.In my mind, Scott Thomas gave a terrific performance, as usual. Two of her ""speeches"" were highlights in the movie: the phone call to Mr. Ford's recorder and her statement to the press as she left the hospital. The hospital statement summed up the movie in a brief, brilliant fashion.At the end, out of pain and disappointment came the possibility of happiness.How many hours of great entertainment and story telling was given to us by Sydney Pollack?

The first third of the film is great, both in plot and character development: Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas discover that their spouses were having an affair when the plane carrying the adulterers crashes.  Ford, a policeman, and Thomas, a politician, handle the revelation in different ways: his is to find out everything about the situation; hers is to ignore the adultery with the reasoning that the situation is over, permanently, so why dredge it all up?  The film begins to fall apart midway through, when Ford and Thomas grope each other in the airport parking lot.  They then embark on a misconceived affair of their own, which I presume is supposed to elicit sympathy from the viewer; I wanted to throw things at the screen for ruining any expectation of true feelings from the characters for each other.  As the plot continues, it unravels: while continuing to pursue the secret lives of the deceased spouses, Ford is shot, Thomas loses an election, and they part.  The end of the film would be wonderfully realistic had the sex scenes not occurred too early in the film: Ford meets Thomas at the airport unexpectedly, and asks her out.  She may or may not (depending on your interpretation) leave the door open for a future relationship.  Take out the groping and sex scenes, and the film would be better.  And one question no one brings up during the film: since the adulterous spouses were killed while on an airplane, why do Ford and Thomas constantly fly everywhere with no mention of fear of flying or what happened?  I don't think that in real life, people who lose loved ones to an air disaster immediately hop on the first plane they see.

The essential problem that many have with the film is not that it's poorly written, directed, or  acted, but that it has a very limited audience.  It's definitely NOT a  first date movie, because the central theme of the film is that you can't  trust your partners.  It's not an action movie so it's not for those  seeking escapism.  And it's not a comedy so it's hardly the kinda movie  that a large group of friends would go see.  It's the kind of movie you pop  into the DVD player when you're in the mood to read a good book, but your  eyes just won't focus on the page.Yet even if it's a film that's not  particularly well-suited to everyone's tastes, it's still a great film.  This is a Vaclav Havel-esque study in the nature of betrayal, the power of  honesty, and the need for other people to help us through personal crises.The acting is powerful because of its understatedness.Kristin  Scott Thomas perfectly navigates the role of a congresswoman who can't ever  be caught on-the-record saying anything which might be misconstrued, and  who, at the same time, probably is as okay as she keeps saying with just  letting go of her adulterous husband.  Her perturbation with Ford's  relentless pursuit of the truth about their spouses' betrayal is genuinely  annoying to the congresswoman, and she makes us clearly see the difference  between these two characters' reactions to the same basic problem.Meanwhile, Harrison Ford, though entirely more obsessed with the nature  of the adultery, never shows more than controlled emotion about his wife  until a late, key sequence.  To witness his smoldering pain finally bubble  over is so surprisingly powerful that we cry with him.Equally unique  is the ending in which difficult choices are made.  For students of film, I  think this ending ranks as one of the better in the American cinema.  Though the setup for the scene is somewhat politically implausible, given  what we know of the campaign Kristin Scott Thomas has run, the payoff finds  a way to be at once joyous without being a traditional 'happy  ending'.(For DVD-philes, this title has lots of goodies, including a  superb running commentary by director Pollock.  This is also the first DVD  I've seen where the reason for deleting certain scenes was given by the  director.  It's fascinating to hear why a scene which was originally  thought brilliant made it to the cutting room floor.)",4,"Character study in understated, Eastern European tradition",953337600,"03 18, 2000",2000,2524,"['Hardly', 'stuff', 'typical', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'study', 'nature', 'love', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'cold', 'essential', 'problem', 'many', 'have', 'film', 'not', 'poorly', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'very', 'limited', 'audience', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'first', 'date', 'movie', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'partners', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'not', 'seeking', 'escapism', 'not', 'comedy', 'hardly', 'kinda', 'movie', 'large', 'group', 'friends', 'would', 'go', 'see', 'kind', 'movie', 'pop', 'DVD', 'player', 'when', ""'re"", 'mood', 'read', 'good', 'book', 'eyes', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'focus', 'page.Yet', 'even', 'film', 'not', 'particularly', 'well-suited', 'everyone', 'tastes', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'Vaclav', 'Havel-esque', 'study', 'nature', 'betrayal', 'power', 'honesty', 'need', 'other', 'people', 'help', 'personal', 'crises.The', 'acting', 'powerful', 'understatedness.Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'perfectly', 'role', 'congresswoman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'be', 'caught', 'on-the-record', 'saying', 'anything', 'might', 'be', 'misconstrued', 'who', 'same', 'time', 'probably', 'as', 'okay', 'saying', 'just', 'letting', 'go', 'adulterous', 'husband', 'perturbation', 'Ford', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'truth', 'spouses', 'betrayal', 'genuinely', 'annoying', 'congresswoman', 'clearly', 'see', 'difference', 'two', 'characters', 'reactions', 'same', 'basic', 'problem.Meanwhile', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'entirely', 'more', 'obsessed', 'nature', 'adultery', 'never', 'more', 'controlled', 'emotion', 'wife', 'late', 'key', 'sequence', 'witness', 'smoldering', 'pain', 'finally', 'bubble', 'over', 'so', 'surprisingly', 'powerful', 'cry', 'him.Equally', 'unique', 'ending', 'difficult', 'choices', 'are', 'made', 'students', 'film', 'think', 'ending', 'ranks', 'one', 'better', 'American', 'cinema', 'setup', 'scene', 'somewhat', 'politically', 'implausible', 'given', 'what', 'know', 'campaign', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'run', 'payoff', 'way', 'be', 'once', 'joyous', 'being', 'traditional', ""'happy"", 'ending', 'DVD-philes', 'title', 'lots', 'goodies', 'including', 'superb', 'running', 'commentary', 'director', 'Pollock', 'also', 'first', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'where', 'reason', 'deleting', 'certain', 'scenes', 'was', 'given', 'director', 'fascinating', 'hear', 'why', 'scene', 'was', 'originally', 'thought', 'brilliant', 'made', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor']",N/A
