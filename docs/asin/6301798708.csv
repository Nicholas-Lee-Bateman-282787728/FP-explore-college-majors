The characters were well developed, in a very effective yet brief manner.....  You pick up on a real sense of community that folks had to have in those days. Excellent performances that captured the innocence yet also the occasional brutality. hardship, tragedies, but also the joy  and something of the lifestyles of the time. Any interested in our American Heritage will be interested in this film.  Although Native Americans (and the Brits) are the &#34;bad guys&#34; in the film, it is only due to the particular historical context in which the film is based, both in time and location.  Middle New York State was the edge of the Wilderness, and the time was 1776-1777 and the bloody Battle of Oriskany was about to leave it's mark. Edna May Oliver really was the scene stealer and the fun relationship between Ward Bond's character and her character is fascinating.",5,A great historical film with good drama,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,967,"['movie', 'very', 'much', 'mirrors', 'historical', 'fact', 'how', 'people', 'frontier', 'colonial', 'America', 'lived', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'developed', 'very', 'effective', 'yet', 'brief', 'manner', '..', 'pick', 'up', 'real', 'sense', 'community', 'folks', 'had', 'have', 'days', 'Excellent', 'performances', 'captured', 'innocence', 'yet', 'also', 'occasional', 'brutality', 'hardship', 'tragedies', 'also', 'joy', 'something', 'lifestyles', 'time', 'interested', 'American', 'Heritage', 'will', 'be', 'interested', 'film', 'Native', 'Americans', 'Brits', 'are', '34', 'bad', 'guys', '34', 'film', 'only', 'due', 'particular', 'historical', 'context', 'film', 'based', 'time', 'location', 'Middle', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'was', 'edge', 'Wilderness', 'time', 'was', '1776-1777', 'bloody', 'Battle', 'Oriskany', 'was', 'leave', 'mark', 'Edna', 'May', 'Oliver', 'really', 'was', 'scene', 'stealer', 'fun', 'relationship', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'character', 'character', 'fascinating']",N/A
268350,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301798708,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","John Ford is just one of those directors that all of my friends adore and I have just never embraced.  I have liked his films, never loved them.  A large part of this is my disconnect with the genre that he so often dwells within.  The western film is just not my cup of tea.  I like some of them, and have even fallen in love with more recent interpretations of the genre (The Proposition comes instantly to mind), but as a whole I am just not drawn to the genre.1939 is largely regarded as the greatest year for film; ever.  In that year, John Ford directed three films, all of which are considered masterpieces today.  I really liked `Stagecoach'.  It was a fast paced and interestingly layered character piece that had a handful of great performances.  I didn't `love' it though.  I kind of hated `Young Mr. Lincoln', to many of my friends shock and disapproval.  I'm supposed to love that movie, but I found it drab and boring, albeit beautifully shot.  That brings me to `Drums Along the Mohawk', a film I initially wanted to avoid and yet, the name Claudette Colbert and the year 1939 made it a `must see' in my eyes.I absolutely LOVED this movie.First of all, the film is technically beautiful.  The costumes, the sets, the cinematography, the acting, the pacing, the script; it was all just fantastic.  You are completely consumed by the film and everything going on.  It pulls you in thanks to the rich authenticity of every frame.  `Stagecoach' may have been Ford's biggest Oscar vehicle, but in all honesty this one should have racked in the gold for him.  He is on point with every sequence, building tension and humor and romance in perfect unison.The film tells the story of a newlywed couple who are thrust into tense situations during the Revolution.  Living in rugged New York, Gilbert and his `upper crust' wife Lana try and start a new life together, building things up with their own hands, but when their home is burnt to the ground by Indians they have to start from scratch.  That means taking on work from a `tough as nails' widow who lets them live in her guest home in exchange for their services on her farm.  As the Revolutionary War springs forward, Gil is forced to pick up arms and the danger around them swells to higher extremes.  Their bond is never broken though, and together they find a place for themselves in this `new frontier'.Colbert (one of the greatest actresses ever) is in fine form here, as is Fonda.  I've never really liked anyone in the Fonda household (Henry, Jane and Peter all have this odd signature acting persona) but this role fits within Fonda's wheelhouse and offers him a chance to shine.  Edna May Oliver is effortless as Mrs. McKlennar (a much finer performance than the one she offered in `Second Fiddle', this same year) and John Carradine is nearly unrecognizable under all that makeup (I really thought he was an Indian).But this film is Ford's, and quite frankly it may be the finest one he ever directed.",5,I hear those drums loud and clear...,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,2973,"['John', 'Ford', 'just', 'one', 'directors', 'friends', 'adore', 'have', 'just', 'never', 'embraced', 'have', 'liked', 'films', 'never', 'loved', 'large', 'part', 'disconnect', 'genre', 'so', 'often', 'western', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'like', 'have', 'even', 'fallen', 'love', 'more', 'recent', 'interpretations', 'genre', 'Proposition', 'instantly', 'mind', 'whole', 'am', 'just', 'not', 'drawn', 'genre.1939', 'largely', 'regarded', 'greatest', 'year', 'film', 'ever', 'year', 'John', 'Ford', 'directed', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'considered', 'masterpieces', 'today', 'really', 'liked', 'Stagecoach', 'was', 'fast', 'paced', 'interestingly', 'layered', 'character', 'piece', 'had', 'handful', 'great', 'performances', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'kind', 'hated', 'Young', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', 'many', 'friends', 'shock', 'disapproval', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'love', 'movie', 'found', 'drab', 'boring', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'film', 'initially', 'wanted', 'avoid', 'yet', 'name', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'year', '1939', 'made', 'must', 'see', 'eyes.I', 'absolutely', 'LOVED', 'movie.First', 'film', 'technically', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'sets', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'pacing', 'script', 'was', 'just', 'fantastic', 'are', 'completely', 'consumed', 'film', 'everything', 'going', 'thanks', 'rich', 'authenticity', 'frame', 'Stagecoach', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Ford', 'biggest', 'Oscar', 'vehicle', 'honesty', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'racked', 'gold', 'point', 'sequence', 'building', 'tension', 'humor', 'romance', 'perfect', 'unison.The', 'film', 'story', 'newlywed', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'thrust', 'tense', 'situations', 'Revolution', 'Living', 'rugged', 'New', 'York', 'Gilbert', 'upper', 'crust', 'wife', 'Lana', 'try', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'together', 'building', 'things', 'up', 'own', 'hands', 'when', 'home', 'burnt', 'ground', 'Indians', 'have', 'start', 'scratch', 'taking', 'work', 'tough', 'nails', 'widow', 'who', 'live', 'guest', 'home', 'exchange', 'services', 'farm', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'springs', 'forward', 'Gil', 'forced', 'pick', 'up', 'arms', 'danger', 'higher', 'extremes', 'bond', 'never', 'broken', 'together', 'find', 'place', 'new', ""frontier'.Colbert"", 'one', 'greatest', 'actresses', 'ever', 'fine', 'form', 'here', 'Fonda', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'anyone', 'Fonda', 'household', 'Henry', 'Jane', 'Peter', 'have', 'odd', 'signature', 'acting', 'persona', 'role', 'Fonda', 'wheelhouse', 'chance', 'shine', 'Edna', 'May', 'Oliver', 'effortless', 'Mrs.', 'McKlennar', 'much', 'finer', 'performance', 'one', 'offered', 'Second', 'Fiddle', 'same', 'year', 'John', 'Carradine', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'makeup', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'Indian', '.But', 'film', 'Ford', 'quite', 'frankly', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'one', 'ever', 'directed']",N/A

268359,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6301798708,C. O. DeRiemer,"[9, 10]","When Lana Martin (Claudette Colbert) arrives by wagon with her new husband, Gil (Henry Fonda), to Mohawk Valley and his homestead, she isn't prepared for what she sees. The time is just before the Revolutionary War. The valley is beautiful and unspoiled, but the homestead is a one-room log cabin Gil has built, and the farm will need to be worked by the two of them. Lana has never seen an Indian, but in the course of the movie she's going to see a lot, and most won't be friendly.Drums Along the Mohawk is John Ford's curious but effective look at one aspect of the Revolutionary War. The story isn't about George Washington or the great battles. It's the story of what happens in this one, isolated valley in upstate New York. While there are Indian attacks and we can see the results of a battle or two, the story really is about Lana Martin and how she changed. We watch her and Gil build their farm, and we see it burnt to the ground when war comes to the valley. From a young woman in a big, frilly dress facing a life she had never imagined, by the end of the movie Lana is wearing a soldier's coat and is prepared to shoot down an attacker, which she does with hardly a blink. She sees Gil return from his first battle almost shell-shocked. We see her and Gil having to become hired hands when their farm is destroyed. We see her suffer a miscarriage. At the start of the movie, Gil was an honest, hard-working young man, almost naive at times. Now he and Lana are watching the birth of their new nation. They've both become...capable. ""Well,"" Gil says to her at the close, ""I reckon we'd better be gettin' back to work. There's goin' to be a heap to do from now on."" And we know he's talking about building a nation, not just a new farm.The movie is effective despite John Ford's long-time propensity for ham-handed humor, sentimental myth building and his indulgence in stereotypical portrayals of Indians as either child-like objects of amusement or animal-like objects of fear. What saves this story, as it saved many of Ford's films, is his great talent for cinematic story-telling. As corn-ball as some of the scenes in this movie are -- the short, chubby drunk or Gil's amazement that his wife is giving birth or the wise but child-like behavior of the Christian Indian chief -- we still are caught up in Gil's and Lana's story. Although the movie is particularly a pean to the women who had to struggle on, sometimes fighting, sometimes waiting, Ford gives the film an unusual unwarlike tone. The widow Mrs. McKennar, who took Gil and Lana in when their farm was destroyed, looks at Gil marching off to his first battle and thinks about her husband. ""Sometimes he'd wave. Ten to one he wasn't even seeing me. He was thinking about all those men, you see. All those men he went out to fight...to kill and be killed...blast his eyes, loving it."" One powerful scene has Gil and the other men back from the battle. They won but it didn't go well. Gil has collapsed, and as Lana tends to him he barely notices her. He just stares into the distance while he tells what happened when they were ambushed. ""I got down back of a log and aimed at a fellow. He leaped straight up in the air. Fell forward on his face. After that we just kept shooting as fast as we could load for I don't know how long. Adam Hartman came over beside me. His musket was broke. He had a spear. He kept grinning. I remember thinking, 'He's having a good time. He likes this.' Pretty soon he pointed off. I saw an Indian coming toward us, naked. I tried to load but it was too late. Adam stood up and braced his spear and the Indian came down. I never saw a fellow look so funny, so surprised. He just hung there, with his mouth open...lookin' at us, not sayin' a word. I had to shoot him, there wasn't anything else to do.""Ford pushes the buttons of duty, faith and patriotism. We've learned that war isn't the glorious struggle some make it out to be. Still, Ford shows us that fighting to protect our land, to protect our chance to build our farm and keep our children safe is proper. In 1939, that was a strong message. So was his theme of patriotism with which he closes the movie. At the fort in Mohawk Valley a company of regular soldiers arrives to tell the people that the war has been won, that Cornwallis has surrendered to Washington. They're carrying a flag. A churchman looks at it and says to the others, ""So that's our new flag, the thing we've been fighting for. Thirteen stripes for the colonies and thirteen stars in a circle for the Union."" And with that a couple of men take the flag and climb to the top of the church steeple, where they tie it down so that it waves in the wind. Ford knew how to punch home a point, alright.Fonda and Colbert were both fine actors. Fonda, in particular, brings, as usual, a strong sense of decency to his role. While I think he and Colbert make a slightly improbable pair (Colbert in all her roles, for me, seems to have a sly worldliness that makes her so good at sophisticated comedy), they work well together. The movie is really war from a woman's point of view, and Colbert brings it off.The DVD presentation is, to my eyes, variable. There is an extra that shows how the film was restored, but I think a good deal more work, if it is possible, is needed. At times the film is gorgeous, at other times the picture is too soft. Often, especially during daylight scenes, there is a faint but noticeable red or green edge to people and objects.",4,"An engrossing Revolutionary War story from John Ford, with many of his strengths

A spinster with a large farm, Sarah McKlennar (Edna May Oliver), comes to their rescue when she hires Gilbert to work as a field hand and gives the Martins a place to stay. The rugged life of the farm and frontier doesn't always sit well with Lana, who was raised in wealthy and comfortable circumstances - but in time she develops a thicker skin and learns to love their new life in the Mohawk Valley, especially after giving birth to their first son. Gilbert joins the militia, who must do battle both with the local Indian tribes and the British soldiers who are provoking them to battle. Gilbert returns wounded, and as he recuperates, a healthy crop rises in the fields, but their satisfaction is short lived when the Indians once again hit the warpath.Oscar Nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Edna May Oliver) & Best Color Cinematography1939 was a big year at the Academy Awards ceremony for director par-excellence John Ford, as he also garnered a nomination for Best Director for Stagecoach (1939)BIOS:1.

268382,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,6301798708,J. Michael Click,"[3, 3]","Movie: *****  DVD Transfer: **** 1/2  Extras: ***""Drums Along the Mohawk"" is prime John Ford, an example of the screen Americana of which he and fellow director Henry King were masters.  Based on a popular novel by Walter Edmonds, the story concerns the trials and tribulations of a young couple (beautifully played by Claudette Colbert and Henry Fonda) who settle in New York's Mohawk Valley, only to become swept up in the American Revolution.  Presented as a series of vignettes, the movie begins with the couple's marriage ceremony and follows them as they travel through the wilderness; set up a home; clear their land; begin a family; and are finally faced with the challenge of fighting the Redcoats and the American Indians who have allied themselves with the British.  Questions of historical accuracy aside, the film is superbly acted (with an especially notable performance by distinctive actress Edna May Oliver, who received an Oscar nomination for her work), meticulously directed, and spectacularly photographed in breathtaking three-strip IB Technicolor.Happily, Fox Home Video invested the time and money necessary to have this classic film digitally restored for its debut on DVD.  Having owned the previous VHS and LaserDisc releases of this movie, I can attest that ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" has never looked so stunning.  Although the print is not perfect (several key scenes are marred by a soft quality that appears as subtle red or green outlines among the actors' faces), the video overall is cleaner, crisper, and more free of artifacts than ever before, and the sound is remarkably clear.

I think this is due to the fact that the American side lost most of the battles of that war.  The battle at Saratoga, the surprise attack at Trenton, and the siege of Yorktown are part of the short list of American victories, and except for the occasion television movie or mini-series, they are rarely touched upon.  Consequently, &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; remains the best of American movie about the revolution even though it was made before World War I and even though the redcoats are not really involved in the fight.&quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; does not start off as a movie about the American Revolution.  Instead it begins as a movie about settling the frontier, which, at that point, was upstate New York.  The focus is on a pioneer couple, newlyweds, Gilbert (Henry Fonda) and Magdalena (Claudette Colbert), called Lana.  Martin is a farmer who brings his bride to the Mohawk Valley where their home is burned out by Indians allied with the British.  The couple are taken in by neighbors after that happens and Martin joins the militia, but the settlers are going to need more men than that to fight the Indians and save the fort from attack.Based on a novel by Walter D. Edmonds the screenplay for &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; is by Sonya Levien and Lamar Trotti, although William Faulkner worked on it without receiving credit as well.  Edmonds' history novels were all set in upstate New York and &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; is about the warfare between the settlers and the Six Nations of the Iroquois allied with the British.  The Battle of Oriskany in 1777, fought in a forest, was a American victory although their commander General Nicholas Herkimer (Ralph Imhof) died of his wounds in one of the moving scenes of the film.This was the third film that John Ford made in 1939, following &quot;Stagecoach&quot; with John Wayne and &quot;Young Mr. Lincoln&quot; with Fonda; his next film would be &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot;  Colbert and Fonda are the stars, but they are upstaged by several members of the supporting case, such as Edna May Oliver as Mrs. McKlennar and Arthur Shields as the Reverend Rosenkrantz.  The old lady has such an iron will that she can make Indians take her bed out, with her in it, while they are burning down her home, and the reverend has a memorable scene in which he eases the suffering of a tortured settler.  Fonda is young and earnest, while Colbert comes to terms with what it means to be living on the American frontier in troubled times.More than anything else &quot;Drums Along the Mohwawk&quot; is about people coming to the realization that they are Americans, an interpretation more than amply justified by the film's final scene.

Henry Fonda is a farmer on the Mohawk River in upstate NY, who brings home a &quot;city&quot; bride, Claudette Colbert. Much of the early part of the film is her adaptation to this backwoods life, so different from her father's home. Colbert's character is emblematic of the original settlers of the American continent, who left familiar ways behind them and set off into an adventure undreamed of. Bit by bit, her citified ways have to be jettisoned if she is to be a good wife to her honest and plain-speaking husband. Gradually their smaller domestic drama is engulfed in community concerns as the Revolutionary War whips up the warpath of the Indians surrounding the colonists, and they must fight for their very existence as that new concept, Americans.There are some really pricless episodes in &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot;, such as when Fonda holds his newborn baby for the first time, Colbert goes into hysterics at her first encounter with an Indian, Edna May Oliver confronts Indian braves invading the sanctity of her home, and someone has to get word out of the beseiged fort to the soldiers for relief.You'll be very glad to see &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot;, I assure you.",5,"Relatively Early, Excellent John Ford Movie",999216000,"08 31, 2001",2001,1472,"['Relatively', 'early', 'say', 'think', 'Ford', 'really', 'hit', 'stride', '1940s', 'once', 'started', 'John', 'Wayne', 'cavalry', 'pictures.', 'quot', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'treatment', 'era', 'curiously', 'left', 'alone', 'most', 'American', 'movie', 'studios', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'farmer', 'Mohawk', 'River', 'upstate', 'NY', 'who', 'home', 'quot', 'city', 'quot', 'bride', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Much', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'adaptation', 'backwoods', 'life', 'so', 'different', 'father', 'home', 'Colbert', 'character', 'emblematic', 'original', 'settlers', 'American', 'continent', 'who', 'left', 'familiar', 'ways', 'set', 'off', 'adventure', 'undreamed', 'Bit', 'bit', 'citified', 'ways', 'have', 'be', 'jettisoned', 'be', 'good', 'wife', 'honest', 'plain-speaking', 'husband', 'Gradually', 'smaller', 'domestic', 'drama', 'engulfed', 'community', 'concerns', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'up', 'warpath', 'Indians', 'surrounding', 'colonists', 'must', 'fight', 'very', 'existence', 'new', 'concept', 'Americans.There', 'are', 'really', 'pricless', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'quot', 'such', 'when', 'Fonda', 'newborn', 'baby', 'first', 'time', 'Colbert', 'hysterics', 'first', 'encounter', 'Indian', 'Edna', 'May', 'Oliver', 'confronts', 'Indian', 'braves', 'invading', 'sanctity', 'home', 'someone', 'get', 'word', 'beseiged', 'fort', 'soldiers', 'relief.You', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'glad', 'see', 'quot', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'quot', 'assure']",N/A

268408,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,6301798708,Muzzlehatch,"[2, 2]","The third of John Ford's three films from 1939, and second in a row starring Henry Fonda is a lavish Technicolor adaptation of a 1936 bestselling novel of the same name by Walter D. Edmonds.  The second western in color after JESSE JAMES earlier that year, which also starred Fonda, it's Ford's first color film and the only one he made before 1948's THREE GODFATHERS.  It's a revolutionary-era frontier film, so it can be seen as sitting astride both the war and western genres, though on the whole I think it feels closer to the former.Fonda is Gilbert Martin, a settler in upstate New York who marries Lana Borst (Claudette Colbert), daughter to a wealthy family, in 1776 and moves with her to his farm in the Mohawk Valley - just as the war is getting going, and spreading into this at-the-time remote area.  Soon the Martins have to flee their farm to the safety of Fort Herkimer, as the British and large numbers of Mohawks attack.  Farm burned, they have little choice but to go to work for a landowner who still has property, the widow Mrs. McKlennar (Edna May Oliver), but the war rears its ugly head again shortly and they again have to repair to the fort for the film's long climactic battle sequence.Though the battle scenes are fairly fast-paced and there's a terrific chase sequence involving Martin on the run from several Mohawks over hill and through stream and brush, much of the film is, as usual for Ford, leisurely paced and concerned with community and familial ties.  Mrs. McKlennar, in a wonderfully warm if often biting performance by Oliver (nominated for an Oscar for the role) becomes in the film something like a glue that holds the communities of fort and settlers together, helping to build up the confidence of the Martins and other young farmers as their livelihoods disappear, and perpetual Ford stock company veteran Ward Bond is at hand as Adam Hartman, a jovial and larger-than-life presence who contrasts nicely with his friend the more stolid Fonda character.  Chief John Big Tree of the Onondaga plays Blue Back, the one friendly native throughout the story, and though he's certainly stereotyped in his speech patterns it's a fairly dignified performance and role - notably he disdains whiskey when first offered it.  And last but not least, John Carradine is on hand as the sinister one-eyed man the Martins meet early on while staying at an inn on their journey to their new home - but whose questioning of their political loyalties proves notable later in the film.There is one real problem in the cast, and that's Colbert - or rather, the character of Lana.  I try not to bring too much of a 21st century mentality into viewing women's roles in films of this vintage, but the early scene of Lana falling apart on first encountering a ""savage"", the harmless Blue Back, and a couple of later moments really have to make one wonder what Martin saw in her - and how well he bothered to prepare her for what she would encounter in the wilds.  To be fair, she becomes a stronger character later in the film, and I suspect it was Ford's intention to show her growth into a tough pioneer woman, but some of those early scenes can't help but feel exaggerated and a little bit cringe-worthy to me.  It's not an enormous problem overall, and it certainly doesn't wreck the film, but it does keep me from being as enthusiastic about it as I am for many of Ford's other films from this period.Bert Glennon and Ray Rennahan provide the gorgeous early Technicolor camerawork - the chase sequence, with Martin silhouetted against the flaming sun in particular is quite well done - and Alfred Newman the rousing score, full of Revolutionary-era themes and songs that give the film, made on the eve of another war, a strongly patriotic and chest-thumping feeling - though it never gets to the level of propaganda, thankfully.",4,Early color western/war film from John Ford stresses community as much as action,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,3852,"['third', 'John', 'Ford', 'three', 'films', '1939', 'second', 'row', 'starring', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'lavish', 'Technicolor', 'adaptation', '1936', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Walter', 'D.', 'Edmonds', 'second', 'western', 'color', 'JESSE', 'JAMES', 'earlier', 'year', 'also', 'starred', 'Fonda', 'Ford', 'first', 'color', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'made', '1948', 'THREE', 'GODFATHERS', 'revolutionary-era', 'frontier', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'sitting', 'war', 'western', 'genres', 'whole', 'think', 'closer', 'former.Fonda', 'Gilbert', 'Martin', 'settler', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'Lana', 'Borst', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'family', '1776', 'moves', 'farm', 'Mohawk', 'Valley', 'just', 'war', 'getting', 'going', 'spreading', 'at-the-time', 'remote', 'area', 'Soon', 'Martins', 'have', 'flee', 'farm', 'safety', 'Fort', 'Herkimer', 'British', 'large', 'numbers', 'Mohawks', 'attack', 'Farm', 'burned', 'have', 'little', 'choice', 'go', 'work', 'landowner', 'who', 'still', 'property', 'widow', 'Mrs.', 'McKlennar', 'Edna', 'May', 'Oliver', 'war', 'ugly', 'head', 'again', 'shortly', 'again', 'have', 'repair', 'fort', 'film', 'long', 'climactic', 'battle', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'fairly', 'fast-paced', 'terrific', 'chase', 'sequence', 'involving', 'Martin', 'run', 'several', 'Mohawks', 'hill', 'stream', 'brush', 'much', 'film', 'usual', 'Ford', 'leisurely', 'paced', 'concerned', 'community', 'familial', 'ties', 'Mrs.', 'McKlennar', 'wonderfully', 'warm', 'often', 'biting', 'performance', 'Oliver', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'role', 'film', 'something', 'glue', 'communities', 'fort', 'settlers', 'together', 'helping', 'build', 'up', 'confidence', 'Martins', 'other', 'young', 'farmers', 'livelihoods', 'disappear', 'perpetual', 'Ford', 'stock', 'company', 'veteran', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'hand', 'Adam', 'Hartman', 'jovial', 'larger-than-life', 'presence', 'who', 'nicely', 'friend', 'more', 'stolid', 'Fonda', 'character', 'Chief', 'John', 'Big', 'Tree', 'Onondaga', 'Blue', 'Back', 'one', 'friendly', 'native', 'story', 'certainly', 'stereotyped', 'speech', 'fairly', 'dignified', 'performance', 'role', 'notably', 'whiskey', 'when', 'first', 'offered', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'John', 'Carradine', 'hand', 'sinister', 'one-eyed', 'man', 'Martins', 'meet', 'early', 'staying', 'inn', 'journey', 'new', 'home', 'questioning', 'political', 'loyalties', 'notable', 'later', 'film.There', 'one', 'real', 'problem', 'cast', 'Colbert', 'rather', 'character', 'Lana', 'try', 'not', 'bring', 'too', 'much', '21st', 'century', 'mentality', 'viewing', 'women', 'roles', 'films', 'vintage', 'early', 'scene', 'Lana', 'falling', 'apart', 'first', 'encountering', 'savage', 'harmless', 'Blue', 'Back', 'couple', 'later', 'moments', 'really', 'have', 'make', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'Martin', 'saw', 'how', 'well', 'bothered', 'prepare', 'what', 'would', 'encounter', 'wilds', 'be', 'fair', 'stronger', 'character', 'later', 'film', 'suspect', 'was', 'Ford', 'intention', 'show', 'growth', 'tough', 'pioneer', 'woman', 'early', 'scenes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'exaggerated', 'little', 'bit', 'cringe-worthy', 'not', 'enormous', 'problem', 'overall', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'wreck', 'film', 'keep', 'being', 'enthusiastic', 'am', 'many', 'Ford', 'other', 'films', 'period.Bert', 'Glennon', 'Ray', 'Rennahan', 'provide', 'gorgeous', 'early', 'Technicolor', 'camerawork', 'chase', 'sequence', 'Martin', 'silhouetted', 'flaming', 'sun', 'particular', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'Alfred', 'Newman', 'rousing', 'score', 'full', 'Revolutionary-era', 'themes', 'songs', 'give', 'film', 'made', 'eve', 'war', 'strongly', 'patriotic', 'chest-thumping', 'feeling', 'never', 'level', 'propaganda', 'thankfully']",N/A

That plot alone would make a good movie but with a backdrop of the American Revolution, a spectacular supporting cast such as Ward Bond and John Carradine and particularly Edna May Oliver as Mrs. McKlennar the movie shines producing drama, comedy and action in a package as beautifully shot as it is acted.To say this is a movie that shouldn't be missed in an incredible understatement.",5,The Duke Snider of 1939,1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,1113,"['initial', 'book', 'baseballThe', 'Bill', 'James', 'Historical', 'Baseball', 'AbstractBill', 'James', 'when', 'picking', 'best', 'baseball', 'players', 'time', 'comments', 'how', 'sometimes', 'talent', 'stacks', 'positions', 'great', 'description', 'movies', '1939.Drums', 'Mohawk', 'sometimes', 'forgotten', 'epics', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Stagecoach', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'just', 'Duke', 'Snider', 'Willie', 'Mays', 'Mickey', 'Mantle', 'Joe', 'DiMaggio', 'almost', 'other', 'year', 'might', 'have', 'managed', 'be', 'best', 'picture', 'year', '1939', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'best', 'picture', 'made', 'John', 'Ford.Yet', 'movie', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'new', 'wife', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'wilderness', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'being', 'new', 'life', 'plot', 'alone', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'backdrop', 'American', 'Revolution', 'spectacular', 'supporting', 'cast', 'such', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'John', 'Carradine', 'particularly', 'Edna', 'May', 'Oliver', 'Mrs.', 'McKlennar', 'movie', 'producing', 'drama', 'comedy', 'action', 'package', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'acted.To', 'say', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed', 'incredible', 'understatement']",N/A

268418,A3GLF9XK4AUAHS,6301798708,Robert E. Nylund,"[8, 10]","It's amazing that Hollywood has made comparatively few movies about the American Revolution, despite the great drama and conflict as a newly-united group of colonists decided they had suffered too much at the hands of their home country.  Taxation was certainly a major factor in the decision of the Americans to break away from Great Britain.  The overwhelming factor, of course, a desire for greater freedom, especially since King George III seemed to be indifferent to their fate and situation.  Once the decision was made to revolt, and the King was sent the Declaration of Independence, the course was established.This film, as well as Mel Gibson's powerful ""The Patriot,"" makes it clear what Americans suffered and endured in their desire to be free.  They learned they could only succeed through guerilla warfare, when they faced a highly trained, disciplined British Army, which was used to wearing brightly-colored uniforms, marching in straight lines, and being accompanied by a military band!  The Americans followed the Native American's example by hiding behind trees, bushes, and rocks and firing at the British soldiers as they marched in formation.Both films also make it quite clear that, despite the American ingenuity and imagination (and the help of some German and French officers), they had a long, hard fight in defeating the British.  This film focuses on a somewhat different battle, or series of battles, in which a small group of British officers utilized members of the Mohawk tribe to defeat the Americans.  Of course, the Mohawks were undoubtedly upset anyway because the American settlers had invaded their lands.In this film, John Ford narrowed his focus on just a small part of the Revolutionary War and, in particular, showed its impact on a group of settlers/farmers in the Mohawk Valley.  Most of the story deals with newlyweds, portrayed by Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert, who are having enough trouble simply adjusting to married life and the challenges of trying to survive in what was then the western wilderness.  That probably would have been a story in itself, but this one shows the added dangers and threats of a war.  They lose everything in the first attack and must then live with a wealthy widow, who later loses much of her property and then her life.  It is a constant struggle for all of the settlers to survive in the midst of such overwhelming dangers.Fonda joins a militia and quickly becomes friends with another settler, delightfully portrayed by Ward Bond, John Wayne's longtime friend.  They are roused by the preaching of a rather unconventional but patriotic parson portrayed by another of John Ford's favorite actors, Arthur Shields.  The battle sequences are quite spectacular for their time and we get a good idea of the horrors of war, especially in the aftermath of one battle where the surviving, wounded soldiers are tended at the widow's house.  (The widow, by the way, is a feisty lady portrayed by Edna Mae Oliver.)The use of three-strip Technicolor in this film was an additional factor.  This was actually John Ford's first film in full color.  Technicolor was still relatively new in 1939 and it had only been three years since the bulky, very heavy Technicolor cameras had been used outdoors.  The Technicolor company has first thought it would be impossible to guarantee accurate colors unless the cameras were used in the studio with controlled lighting.  The first time Technicolor finally agreed to allow its cameras outside was in 1936 in ""The Trail of the Lonesome Pine.""  Even then, Technicolor always mandated that a consultant be present during filming.Three, synchronized strips of film were run through the cameras and they were later combined in the laboratory to produce a full, vivid range of color.  The color separations in the three negatives were preserved under controlled conditions, making it possible for most of these early color films to be fully restored many years later.  That is why so many of the three-strip Technicolor films have been restored for release on video and they still have excellent color.  There was, of course, a tendency to be rather garish at times, but this adds to the vividness of such wonderful films as this.Yes, 1939 was probably the greatest year in the history of the movies.  The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences had a long list of nominated films for Best Picture and it was probably difficult for voters to finally agree that ""Gone With The Wind"" was the greatest of all that year's memorable films.  Certainly ""Drums Along The Mohawk"" ranks high among the films of 1939 and it is also among the best of John Ford's numerous outstanding films.  Little wonder that the legendary genius Orson Welles also said that John Ford was the greatest of all directors, a true master, despite his notorious reputation as a tyrant or martinet, who would criticize and even humilitate ANY actor who he felt wasn't doing his best.Adding to this a very enjoyable, very exciting, and very touching film is a musical score by Twentieth Century Fox's longtime musical director, Alfred Newman, who also composed the famous fanfare that has introduced most of Fox's films since 1935.  Newman later composed the music for Fox's very first CinemaScope release, ""The Robe,"" in 1953.  He was known for rather majestic, inspiring music; he was also capable of writing very sensitive tunes.  One hears a good sampling of Newman's musical abilities in this film.",5,A Rare Revolutionary War Film,1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,5482,"['amazing', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'comparatively', 'few',

The action scenes are pretty standard and not very exciting.  I doubt any Indians would have rushed the stockade as portrayed here.  Their usual tactic for the period was to surround and snipe away at these locations until they were starved out.  Henry Fonda and Cluadette Colbert are adequate for their parts, but there is nothing spectacular about what they do in this film.

Morman farmers were happily recruited as extras and mild Navaho and Piute Indians were transmuted into fierce Iroquois tribesmen. To heighten the drama, historical sidelights are deleted from the novel by Walter D. Edmonds and Colbert is given more sophistication than the original Lana possessed. The popularity of Claudette Colbert (since her 1934 performance in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT) rested largely on her charm and aptitude for deft, bubbling comedy roles. To an interviewer, she once mentioned that out of every six pictures, she would like to play four comedies, one drama and one spectacle. In DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK, Claudette has her chance at drama with a good many spectacular overtones. As Lana Martin, the city bred wife of a New York frontiersman, she enacts a difficult emotional part with extraordinary skill and sensitivity.

Edmonds' historical novel, ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939) remains among the few memorable films about the American Revolution. Director John Ford's first Technicolor production benefits immeasurably from the Oscar-nominated cinematography of Bert Glennon and Ray Rennahan.

The rich early three colour technicolor prints serve to enrich and enhance the natural beauty of the location footage; contrary to some of the other reviewers opinions I find nothing wrong at all with this DVD transfer of a sixty six year old movie. 20th Century Fox have done an excellent job, but, I would have liked a few extras, such as the making of 'Drums Along the Mohawk'and some background info on the cast.Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert carried out their roles with aplomb and the expert  professionlism that one expects from acters who have reached the dizzy heights of stardom. However, for me, Edna May Oliver made this movie the memorable experience that it is; she stole every scene that she was in and who could ever forget the scene where she would rather be burnt to death in her bed than leave it?No political correctness here either, if this movie was being made today it would not have depicted the Indians as mean and cruel drunken savages acting on the behalf of a white man's army but rather as a simple people who's acts are as the result of some form of trickery.This one was great entertainment in 1939 and it is still great entertainment in 2005; in fact it hasn't dated at all.

268426,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301798708,Simon Davis,"[21, 22]","&quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; was one of many lavish classic productions released in 1939 and marked the first real venture by Director John Ford into classic movie status. This production is lavish in all departments from the lush colour photography which even in 1939 was still only employed on a handful of productions, to the beautiful on location photography utilised throughout the story, to the many exciting action filled sequences employed around which the storyline is structured.&quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; tells the rather simple story of Mohawk Valley farmer Gilbert Martin who courts and marries refined city bred Lana Magdalena (Claudette Colbert)and brings her back to the valley to begin a new life as a farmer's wife in the untamed American wilderness. What ensures is a story of hardship in the face of the unpredictable environment, attacks from Indians, the revolutinary war,  and in carving out a new world and new way of life. Much of the story focuses on Claudette's characters efforts to adjust to this strange and foreign new environment and to make a home for her new husband and she succeeds admirably in the task. It has often been stated by critics that Claudette was far more suited to sophisticated urban comedies and always looked far too modern a screen personality to fit into period productions. While she certainly  had no peer in that area she is highly effective in historical roles as witnessed by her great work in &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot;. In &quot;Mohawk&quot; she displays all the fear and uncertainity of moving to a new land and leaving behind her all that is familiar. While her makeup and pristine outfits throughout tells us this is indeed a Hollywood production I believe it is one of her more appealing performances combining equal measures of doubt about what she has done moving to the wilderness,  to a longing to build a happy life with her husband. Henry Fonda an actor who I normally find fairly bland and unexciting on screen performs very well in this production playing the role of Gilbert who works like ten men to clear his property, often under very trying circumstances, and set up a workable farm with which to support his family.Claudette Colbert by 1939 was at the peak of her popularity and success and that same year turned out what I feel was her greatest film performance in the classic &quot;Midnight&quot;. At the time of release of this film Henry Fonda was also enjoying a triumph in &quot;Jesse James&quot; with Tyrone Power so it was easy to see why this film was also a great success upon release. As with most Epic productions of this type  the supporting cast adds greatly to the overraul impact of a film and &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; had two of the best in Edna May Oliver and John Carradine. Oliver a superb character actress had the important role of Mrs. McKlennar and the character embodies all the standard qualities that she always brought to her film roles, a no nonsense flinty character with a deep down heart of Gold. Her big scene where her home is invaded by rampaging Indians is a delight to witness as she almost bosses them out of destroying her home! John Carradine a regular performer in these Fox productions is also effective in the devious role of Caldwell who is out to further his own ends no matter what it takes.The beautifully staged action sequences of this film are terrific and really add to the excitement of the piece. The attack on the fort and the destruction of the farmers properties are two of the highlights and are staged to the maximum effect that only John Ford could bring to such things.Overraul &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; is an engrossing piece of cinema both from its more personal representations of settlers moving into a hostile land and making a new life, to the standard excitement of the action western type of film complete with Indians, besieged forts and spectacular scenery. In all these respects &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk will not fail to both impress and entertain.",4,Lavish colour production from Hollywood's Golden Age,1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,4069,"['quot', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'quot', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'lavish', 'classic', 'productions', 'released', '1939', 'marked', 'first', 'real', 'venture', 'Director', 'John', 'Ford', 'classic', 'movie', 'status', 'production', 'lavish', 'departments', 'lush', 'colour', 'photography', 'even', '1939', 'was', 'still', 'only', 'employed', 'handful', 'productions', 'beautiful', 'location', 'photography', 'utilised', 'story', 'many', 'exciting', 'action', 'filled', 'sequences', 'employed', 'storyline', 'structured.', 'quot', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'quot', 'rather', 'simple', 'story', 'Mohawk', 'Valley', 'farmer', 'Gilbert', 'Martin', 'who', 'courts', 'marries', 'refined', 'city', 'bred', 'Lana', 'Magdalena', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'back', 'valley', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'farmer', 'wife', 'untamed', 'American', 'wilderness', 'What', 'story', 'hardship', 'face', 'unpredictable', 'environment', 'attacks', 'Indians', 'revolutinary', 'war', 'carving', 'out', 'new', 'world', 'new', 'way', 'life', 'Much', 'story', 'Claudette', 'characters', 'efforts', 'adjust', 'strange', 'foreign', 'new', 'environment', 'make', 'home', 'new', 'husband', 'admirably', 'task', 'often', 'been', 'stated', 'critics', 'Claudette', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'suited', 'sophisticated', 'urban', 'comedies', 'always', 'looked', 'far', 'too', 'modern', 'screen', 'personality', 'fit', 'period', 'productions', 'certainly', 'had', 'peer', 'area', 'highly', 'effective', 'historical', 'roles', 'witnessed', 'great', 'work', 'quot', 'Cleopatra', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sign', 'Cross', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mohawk', 'quot', 'fear', 'uncertainity', 'moving', 'new', 'land', 'leaving', 'familiar', 'makeup', 'pristine', 'outfits', 'tells', 'indeed', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'believe', 'one', 'more', 'appealing', 'performances', 'combining', 'equal', 'measures', 'doubt', 'what', 'done', 'moving', 'wilderness', 'longing', 'build', 'happy', 'life', 'husband', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'actor', 'who', 'normally', 'find', 'fairly', 'bland', 'unexciting', 'screen', 'performs', 'very', 'well', 'production', 'playing', 'role', 'Gilbert', 'who', 'ten', 'men', 'clear', 'property', 'often', 'very', 'trying', 'circumstances', 'set', 'up', 'workable', 'farm', 'support', 'family.Claudette', 'Colbert', '1939', 'was', 'peak', 'popularity', 'success', 'same', 'year', 'turned', 'out', 'what', 'feel', 'was', 'greatest', 'film', 'performance', 'classic', 'quot', 'Midnight', 'quot', 'time', 'release', 'film', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'was', 'also', 'enjoying', 'triumph', 'quot', 'Jesse', 'James', 'quot', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'was', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'success', 'release', 'most', 'Epic', 'productions', 'type', 'supporting', 'cast', 'greatly', 'overraul', 'impact', 'film', 'quot', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'quot', 'had', 'two', 'best', 'Edna', 'May', 'Oliver', 'John', 'Carradine', 'superb', 'character', 'actress', 'had', 'important', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'McKlennar', 'character', 'standard', 'qualities', 'always', 'brought', 'film', 'roles', 'nonsense', 'flinty', 'character', 'deep', 'down', 'heart', 'Gold', 'big', 'scene', 'where', 'home', 'invaded', 'rampaging', 'Indians', 'delight', 'witness', 'almost', 'destroying', 'home', 'John', 'Carradine', 'regular', 'performer', 'Fox', 'productions', 'also', 'effective', 'devious', 'role', 'Caldwell', 'who', 'out', 'further', 'own', 'matter', 'what', 'beautifully', 'staged', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'are', 'terrific', 'really', 'add', 'excitement', 'piece', 'attack', 'fort', 'destruction', 'farmers', 'properties', 'are', 'two', 'highlights', 'are', 'staged', 'maximum', 'effect', 'only', 'John', 'Ford', 'could', 'bring', 'such', 'things.Overraul', 'quot', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'quot', 'engrossing', 'piece', 'cinema', 'more', 'personal', 'representations', 'settlers', 'moving', 'hostile', 'land', 'making', 'new', 'life', 'standard', 'excitement', 'action', 'western', 'type', 'film', 'complete', 'Indians', 'besieged', 'forts', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'respects', 'quot', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'will', 'not', 'fail', 'impress', 'entertain']",N/A

The movie is, to some extent dated, but very good for its day.  The cinematography is very nice and John Ford's direction begins to show his auteur skills.This is, at one level, the story of a couple from marriage to their life on the frontier.  Gil (Henry Fonda) and Lana (Claudette Colbert) Martin get married and move to the frontier (the Mohawk Valley in New York).  Lana comes from a well-to-do family, but is game to struggle on the frontier.  This is as much a movie about characters as about action.  General Herkimer's stand at the battle of Oriskany is only hinted at.  A later battle is more explicitly depicted.The young couple, before the outbreak of war, creates a new life, showing a lot of pluck.  After Oriskany, the British and Native Americans destroy their home; they must come to work for another person (an outstandingly quirky widow, played by Edna May Oliver, who received an Oscar nomination for her role), as they strive to get back on their feet.There is considerable derring-do during the siege of the fort, with a satisfying ending.  There is a somewhat stereotyped view of Native Americans, as one might expect.However, this is a satisfying movie from its time.

They Were Expendable and The Quiet Man are definite John Ford movies.  The studio may have greenlighted those movies, but they were both close to Ford's heart.1939's DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK doesn't seem imbued with quite the degree of burning passion that marks Ford's more personal films.  This story of a young farm couple (Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert) in the upper Mohawk Valley during the Revolutionary War doesn't suffer much for it, though.  This is a beautiful - very nice Technicolor restoration, guys - and exciting story of late colonial life in America.  Young Gil Martin (Fonda) brings his new bride Lana (Colbert) to his humble farm on the fringe of the wilderness.  Along the way they cross paths with the nefarious Caldwell (an eye-patched John Carradine), who's probably a Tory (a bad thing) and is probably going to foment a little counter-revolution among the local Indian tribes (a very bad thing.)There's a Golden Classics feel to DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK.  Which, come to think of it, may be why I like it so much.  The bad guy is apparent early on and the story line is uncomplicated.  The bad Indians are scurrilous and the good Indian, Blue Back (Chief John Big Tree) is a good Christian and an even better comedy foil.  When the humor isn't being politically incorrect (as such things are understood in the early years of the 21st century) it's a little broad and vulgar - nothing too unusual for Ford.  DRUMS was nominated for two Academy Awards - pretty good for a movie made in 1939.  Although it didn't win any, Edna May Oliver was wonderful in her supporting actress role as a tough frontier widow (with a heart of gold, of course.  This is a John Ford movie, after all.)

An enjoyable film that is still very good!Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert play Gil and Lana Martin, the newlywed couple struggling to survive.  Both are very good and believable as husband and wife.  This was a good period for Fonda when he made The Grapes of Wrath around this time.  There is an excellent supporting cast, most notably Ward Bond as Adam, Gil's friend and neighbor, Edna Mae Oliver as the widow Mrs. McLenard, who puts up Gil and Lana when their house is destroyed.  She has some incredibly funny scenes especially when some marauding Indians invade her house, but she refuses to leave even as they drag her out on her bed.  This is an excellent movie with a great cast and excellent story.

As with My Darling Clementine, Ford is much more interested in the ephemera - rituals, gatherings, minor supporting characters - than he is in story or his rather bland leads (Claudette Colbert and a dull Henry Fonda on autopilot, as he is in many of his films for Ford), and much of the humor seems particularly misplaced here, turning the burning of the widow's farm or even the burning alive of one settler into semi-comic moments. The final chase is beautifully shot, but for all Ford's efforts to establish a sense of community worth fighting for, it's hard to care.The original trailer is included.",2,Lavishly produced but not particularly engaging,1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,739,"['risk', 'beating', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'one', 'occasional', 'much-beloved', 'John', 'Ford', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'My', 'Darling', 'Clementine', 'Ford', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'ephemera', 'rituals', 'gatherings', 'minor', 'supporting', 'characters', 'story', 'rather', 'bland', 'leads', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'dull', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'autopilot', 'many', 'films', 'Ford', 'much', 'humor', 'particularly', 'misplaced', 'here', 'turning', 'burning', 'widow', 'farm', 'even', 'burning', 'alive', 'one', 'settler', 'semi-comic', 'moments', 'final', 'chase', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Ford', 'efforts', 'establish', 'sense', 'community', 'worth', 'fighting', 'hard', 'care.The', 'original', 'trailer', 'included']",N/A

Still don't know why some film buffs hail Ford as the demigod of the western genre. Drums Along the Mohawk is filled with melodramatic dialog, sub par acting by Henry Fonda and Colbert, and poor camera work that didn't utilize the sprawling greenery and hilltops that beautify upstate New York. Colbert wears way too much eye makeup and doesn't look like a frontier woman living in the 1700's. Ford gratuitously places his friend Ward Bond in a supporting role, but it is Edna May Oliver who steals every frame that Ford allows her to be in. The sappy soundtrack is misplaced, more suited to the silent film era and not much historical realism is used to legitimize the struggle among settlers, British loyalists, and Native Indians during the 1700's.",2,"""Drums"" Pound a Shallow Beat",1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,849,"['Not', 'much', 'fan', 'John', 'Ford', 'viewing', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'opinion', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'film', 'buffs', 'hail', 'Ford', 'demigod', 'western', 'genre', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'filled', 'melodramatic', 'dialog', 'sub', 'par', 'acting', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Colbert', 'poor', 'camera', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'utilize', 'sprawling', 'greenery', 'hilltops', 'beautify', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'Colbert', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'eye', 'makeup', ""n't"", 'look', 'frontier', 'woman', 'living', '1700', 'Ford', 'gratuitously', 'friend', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'supporting', 'role', 'Edna', 'May', 'Oliver', 'who', 'frame', 'Ford', 'be', 'sappy', 'soundtrack', 'misplaced', 'more', 'suited', 'silent', 'film', 'era', 'not', 'much', 'historical', 'realism', 'used', 'legitimize', 'struggle', 'settlers', 'British', 'loyalists', 'Native', 'Indians', '1700']",N/A
