1552895,AT22X5VD3GFKJ,B008G590UM,Peter D Giatrakis,"[1, 2]","If I am to assume that this documentary is bound by some sort of law. A law that obligates it's creator to portray the topic in a ""balanced"" way giving equal time on either side of the topic. Then maybe this documentary is a little unbalanced BUT it's not bound by this imaginary law. I would be interested to see if any of the 1 star people would ever give the same complaint on a documentary that ONLY shows why we need these ""Standing Armies""We need these armies because we have to assume that if the rest of the world was in our position then IT would be as merciless as us. To that point I am ashamed to say that that MAY be true. Because humans can be so cruel.We are the ones with most of the weapons and cruelty is part of having them, using them. With great power comes great responsibility. Thus the responsible thing to do is first be aware of the injustices and second making the citizens of these powerful states AWARE of the cruelties. SO THEY CAN STOP THEM, LIMIT THEM and make them illegal! Instead so many Americans sit back in all their comfort and just call it a lie. THAT ITSELF IS A LIE. Not only is it a lie but it's actually helping it continue. That makes the person saying the unresearched claims an accomplice. Because they are helping to misinform the citizens of the violating country and its citizens could do something to stop it.The U.S. atrocities only help to put more Americans at risk for retaliation.",5,Great movie.,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,1436,"['am', 'assume', 'documentary', 'bound', 'sort', 'law', 'law', 'creator', 'portray', 'topic', 'balanced', 'way', 'giving', 'equal', 'time', 'side', 'topic', 'Then', 'maybe', 'documentary', 'little', 'unbalanced', 'not', 'bound', 'imaginary', 'law', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'see', '1', 'star', 'people', 'would', 'ever', 'give', 'same', 'complaint', 'documentary', 'ONLY', 'why', 'need', 'Standing', 'Armies', 'need', 'armies', 'have', 'assume', 'rest', 'world', 'was', 'position', 'then', 'IT', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'merciless', 'point', 'am', 'ashamed', 'say', 'MAY', 'be', 'true', 'humans', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'cruel.We', 'are', 'ones', 'most', 'weapons', 'cruelty', 'part', 'having', 'using', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'responsibility', 'Thus', 'responsible', 'thing', 'do', 'first', 'be', 'aware', 'injustices', 'second', 'making', 'citizens', 'powerful', 'states', 'AWARE', 'cruelties', 'THEY', 'CAN', 'STOP', 'THEM', 'LIMIT', 'THEM', 'make', 'illegal', 'Instead', 'so', 'many', 'Americans', 'sit', 'back', 'comfort', 'just', 'call', 'lie', 'ITSELF', 'LIE', 'Not', 'only', 'lie', 'actually', 'helping', 'continue', 'person', 'saying', 'unresearched', 'claims', 'accomplice', 'are', 'helping', 'misinform', 'citizens', 'violating', 'country', 'citizens', 'could', 'do', 'something', 'stop', 'it.The', 'U.S.', 'only', 'help', 'put', 'more', 'Americans', 'risk', 'retaliation']",Standing Army
