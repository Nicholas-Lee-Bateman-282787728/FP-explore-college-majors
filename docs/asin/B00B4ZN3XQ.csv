1621662,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,B00B4ZN3XQ,A Forest Fan,"[2, 5]","The Amazon editorial review gets it wrong, this movie is not about Franklin Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt hosting the king and queen of England at his mother's home. This movie is a narrative by FDR's 5th cousin Daisy, with some other historical tidbits like the King's visit filled in around her diary entries.Lushly filmed in Great Britain, the movie looks and sounds great thanks to the stunning skill of director Roger Michell. Bill Murray is a surprise as he perfectly plays FDR in a manner that in no way reminds one of Ghostbusters, Stripes, or even last decade's Lost in Translation. His seduction of his 5th cousin Daisy is presented as beautifully as possible, but comes off creepy and regrettable. I was wishing Daisy would have slapped his glasses off his presidential face when he moved her hand to his thigh.FDR used a variety of techniques to seduce various women he had his eye on. He sweeps them up a hillside (away from the police escort), to show them a view from a cottage that he had built ""just for them"". That a man of his age has nothing but sex on his mind is an amazing thing, but equally surprising is that each cast off mistress happily takes her turn in his inner circle and ""prepares"" the newest conquest for accepting her place when another conquest beckons.If this all sounds very similar to Bill Clinton's pelvic shenanigans, you're not far off. The movie even has FDR comment at one point on how the press covers for him ranging from sex to polio, and he laments that he hopes this never changes. Of course, this never has changed, as both FDR and Clinton were Democrats, and thus above all law and moral consideration in all respects.The question arises, would Daisy under any other circumstance have an intimate relationship with her elderly, disgusting 5th cousin, were he not president? Of course not! The movie does not shy away from this disconcerting aspect. The dirty laundry is all presented to the audience, for you to react as yourself. I found this a refreshing approach.Murray's scenes with the king and queen of England are charming, as the movie often delights at the ""fish out of water"" notion of the royals over-reacting to the simple moves of their American cousins. But the movie also hints at the dangers of might makes right and why America should never consider the president a king of any sort. I never understood the hero worship of Democrat presidents who abused their office by using it to pursue as much tail as time permitted, whether it was JFK assaulting female journalists in the press pool (Mimi Alford being one), Ted Kennedy driving his chosen victim into a watery abyss, or Bill Clinton forcing himself on unwilling women in hotel rooms. Power corrupts, or these human jackasses were corrupt to begin with. I suspect the latter to be truest.As the movie has given me cause for some reflection, I hope it does for other viewers in their own ways as well. This is one well-shot movie, cast and crew did a superb job. But those looking for a quaint history lesson will find that there is nothing new under the sun, and the perks of power are not limited to philately.",5,Beautiful movie with a lecherous subject,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,3135,"['Amazon', 'editorial', 'review', 'wrong', 'movie', 'not', 'Franklin', 'Roosevelt', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'hosting', 'king', 'queen', 'England', 'mother', 'home', 'movie', 'narrative', 'FDR', '5th', 'cousin', 'Daisy', 'other', 'historical', 'tidbits', 'King', 'visit', 'filled', 'diary', 'entries.Lushly', 'filmed', 'Great', 'Britain', 'movie', 'great', 'thanks', 'stunning', 'skill', 'director', 'Roger', 'Michell', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'surprise', 'perfectly', 'FDR', 'manner', 'way', 'one', 'Ghostbusters', 'Stripes', 'even', 'last', 'decade', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'seduction', '5th', 'cousin', 'Daisy', 'presented', 'as', 'beautifully', 'possible', 'off', 'creepy', 'regrettable', 'was', 'wishing', 'Daisy', 'would', 'have', 'slapped', 'glasses', 'off', 'presidential', 'face', 'when', 'moved', 'hand', 'thigh.FDR', 'used', 'variety', 'techniques', 'seduce', 'various', 'women', 'had', 'eye', 'up', 'hillside', 'away', 'police', 'escort', 'show', 'view', 'cottage', 'had', 'built', 'just', 'man', 'age', 'nothing', 'sex', 'mind', 'amazing', 'thing', 'equally', 'surprising', 'cast', 'off', 'mistress', 'happily', 'turn', 'inner', 'circle', 'prepares', 'newest', 'conquest', 'accepting', 'place', 'when', 'conquest', 'beckons.If', 'very', 'similar', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'pelvic', 'shenanigans', ""'re"", 'not', 'far', 'off', 'movie', 'even', 'FDR', 'comment', 'one', 'point', 'how', 'press', 'ranging', 'sex', 'polio', 'never', 'course', 'never', 'changed', 'FDR', 'Clinton', 'were', 'Democrats', 'thus', 'law', 'moral', 'consideration', 'respects.The', 'question', 'arises', 'would', 'Daisy', 'other', 'circumstance', 'have', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'elderly', 'disgusting', '5th', 'cousin', 'were', 'not', 'president', 'course', 'not', 'movie', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'disconcerting', 'aspect', 'dirty', 'laundry', 'all', 'presented', 'audience', 'react', 'found', 'refreshing', 'approach.Murray', 'scenes', 'king', 'queen', 'England', 'are', 'charming', 'movie', 'often', 'fish', 'water', 'notion', 'royals', 'over-reacting', 'simple', 'moves', 'American', 'cousins', 'movie', 'also', 'dangers', 'might', 'right', 'why', 'America', 'should', 'never', 'consider', 'president', 'king', 'sort', 'never', 'understood', 'hero', 'worship', 'Democrat', 'presidents', 'who', 'abused', 'office', 'using', 'pursue', 'as', 'much', 'tail', 'time', 'permitted', 'was', 'JFK', 'assaulting', 'female', 'journalists', 'press', 'pool', 'Mimi', 'Alford', 'being', 'one', 'Ted', 'Kennedy', 'driving', 'chosen', 'victim', 'watery', 'abyss', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'forcing', 'unwilling', 'women', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'Power', 'corrupts', 'human', 'jackasses', 'were', 'corrupt', 'begin', 'suspect', 'latter', 'be', 'truest.As', 'movie', 'given', 'cause', 'reflection', 'hope', 'other', 'viewers', 'own', 'ways', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'well-shot', 'movie', 'cast', 'crew', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'looking', 'quaint', 'history', 'lesson', 'will', 'find', 'nothing', 'new', 'sun', 'perks', 'power', 'are', 'not', 'limited', 'philately']",N/A

Let me just start out by saying that Bill Murray does an admirable job as FDR. Unfortunately, he was given a very poor script to work with and not even Murray or the superb Laura Linney can save this film. The apparent plot of the movie is that in 1939, FDR summons a distant cousin Daisy (Linney) to his New York country home. Why? Well, we're never exactly sure, but Daisy becomes a confidant and apparently, a lover. In the meantime, they prepare for and host the king and queen of England. Now all of this should make for a good movie, but honestly, the biggest part of this movie deals with whether or not the king will eat a hot dog at the picnic they have planned. I'm not kidding - this takes up a huge amount of the movie. And at 2 hours, this thing plods along like an old basset hound.

(I've been there. It's fabulous.) She even sees an afternoon picnic where the main course is hotdogs as an intentional insult to the Crown.It's only mildly interesting, and the idea that FDR had not one but three simultaneous mistresses pretty sordid. The filmmakers don't miss a chance to paint Eleanor Roosevelt (Olivia Williams) as a dyke who turns a blind eye to her husband's indiscretions. She and her girlfriends live in a separate house where their hobby is building furniture. OKaaayy.While Franklin entertains his guests and snubs Daisy (doesn't invite her to dinner with the royals), she feels neglected, but who cares? Murray is uncharming as her cousin and seems much too old to be philandering. That he does shows that the best and brightest among us can do stupid things.The King (""Bertie"" here) is played as comic relief by Samuel West and Olivia Colman's wife Elizabeth is a total B word who even screams at him for stuttering.

This story is of historic interest and has a positive ending in that FDR agreed to the support that the UK was hoping to obtain for the coming war. Feeling in the U.S. was against involvement in another European war. FDR had the task of changing public opinion. He began by setting up the lend lease program to help with supplies, which he explained to U.S. citizenry as lending a garden hose to a neighbor with a burning house to prevent the fire from spreading to your house. Little is shown of this interesting story in the movie, but the meeting between the English King and FDR stands out and is IMHO the most successful scene in the movie.By concentrating on FDR's romance with his distant cousin Margaret ""Daisy"" Suckley, the film shortchanged both stories: the romance and the royal visit. IMHO the romance was the weaker story-line of the two. Yet another film about the many dalliances of a man in a high position, which actually managed to make the seduction rather boring and trivial and just plain sad.Samuel West does well as George VI and Bill Murray is magical, at times, as FDR. Laura Linney seems wasted in the role of FDR's naive love interest. The other actors seem competent in their roles. Performances are handicapped by the unfocused script.A better script, with more direction, focusing on the royal visit and the plans for and the stakes of the coming war could have resulted in an important and engaging film that could have been a companion piece for ""The King's Speech"".

In the late 1930's, and for the very first time, a European sovereign and her majesty travel to the United States to visit the president. The King and Queen travel to the Hudson Valley, upper New York state, and get ready for a weekend country picnic. This little party will feature the new American ""hot dog"" with mustard, and Indians playing Tom-Tom's. At the same time, President Roosevelt(Bill Murray) begins an affair with his cousin, Daisy(Laura Linney). Daisy doesn't know that there is more than one hen in the hen-house; the president has multiple lovers(and a wife). Before the picnic, FDR assembles a royal group in the drawing room. FDR's mother bursts in: ""You can't serve drinks to the King and Queen"" she shouts. FDR's mother had an alcoholic father and husband. A lively shouting match follows, and FDR proclaims that ""We will have drinks. After all, I'm the president...""British director Roger Michell's tasteful, controlled, yet leisurely non-epic is a classy look at a famous American president(from behind closed doors).

This is more of an episodic slice-of-life than it is a rising action and climax (no pun intended) film. Still, HYDE PARK ON HUDSON does what it set out to do very well and succeeds in being lightheartedly funny, realistic, poignant, and many other things all at once.The subplot concerning the visit of George VI and Queen Elizabeth (superbly played by Samuel West and Olivia Colman) is probably the best part of the entire film. Witnessing the Royalty's bedroom discussions of America and Americans (with special focus on the Roosevelts), I thought, ""That must be very close to how their talks actually went."" All four of the aforementioned actors are quite natural in their roles, and Olivia Williams's performance as Eleanor Roosevelt also deserves special mention. Williams captures Eleanor, physically homely but immensely sincere, remarkably well even though she looks a bit younger than Eleanor actually was/looked in 1939. Though it didn't bother me, I've also heard a number of complaints that FDR himself does not look that much like the real thing in this film.

A serial philanderer yet sincere friend, he is someone whom people have to get to know; he will not change.  Daisy understands this through painful experience, forming a friendship that lasted throughout Roosevelt's lifetime.  Richard Nelson's screenplay also focuses on the encounter between FDR and King George VI (Samuel West); like the President, the King suffers from a disability - his stammer - but through an encounter with FDR he learns to come to terms with it, forming the basis for a lasting friendship that was sustained on a personal as well as a national level.  Sadly HYDE PARK ON HUDSON is let down by its determination to observe the hackneyed conventions of the period drama; there are too many spurious shots of sun-drenched landscapes, or period cars drawing up and departing from FDR's stately home.  Some of the supporting performances are over-drawn: Olivia Colman's Queen Elizabeth comes across as a xenophobic prude, unable (or perhaps unwilling) to contemplate alternative lifestyles.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[18, 27]","When the big dramatic payoff of a movie is the King of England eating a hot dog (and whether he'll have mustard), you know you're in trouble.So it is with ""Hyde Park on Hudson,"" a wishy-washy little movie that has about twenty minutes of actual movie in it. But this story about Daisy Suckley, FDR's distant relative and possible lover, is so painfully padded out that it feels like spending a weekend with a bunch of really dull people you don't like -- and nothing dramatic ever builds up to anything.Daisy (Laura Linney) is summoned by her sixth-cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Bill Murray), who is the president of the US in the years approaching World War II. She becomes his confidante, friend, and possibly a bit more (see the wandering hands in a field of flowers), while remaining clueless about the exact nature of his relationships with his wife Eleanor (Olivia Williams) and his assistant (Elizabeth Marvel).The story mostly follows a particular couple of days, when the newly crowned King George VI (Samuel West) and Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) are visiting in hopes of forging an alliance against the Nazis. During the king's stay, Daisy is made not-so-shockingly aware that she is not the only woman in her cousin's life. Will she leave, or settle? And will Bertie eat a hot dog? (Seriously, there is DRAMA over that!)One question kept flitting through my mind as I watched this movie: What is the point of ANYTHING that is going on? Despite having two potentially interesting stories flitting through it, ""Hyde Park on Hudson"" leaves you with the feeling that absolutely nothing has happened -- or at least, nothing important.Instead, director Roger Michell focuses on everything that doesn't actually matter in the long-run -- we get a whole scene devoted to FDR's mother freaking out because she doesn't want her son offering cocktails to his guests. RIVETING. About half of the movie is watching the British royals twitter and fuss, and the other half is watching the limp, lifeless Daisy wandering around looking sad. There are a few blow-ups -- Daisy gets angry at FDR, the royals have a tiff -- but they don't lead to anything.It also has some fairly unpleasant implications, such as that Daisy's life as a second-string mistress is better than anything else she could have, or that FDR cheats on Eleanor because she's just a mean ol' lesbian. The movie even implies that the ONLY reason that America became embroiled in World War II was because George VI charmed Americans by eating a hot dog. It's almost farcical.About two-thirds of the way through the movie, there IS a twenty-minute period that is both charming and powerful -- most of it is devoted to Bertie and FDR having a candid talk that exposes both their vulnerabilities and feelings about each other. It's a lovely, low-key scene... which ends when we get back to the effing hot dogs.The casting is a pretty mixed bag. Murray is absolutely transcendent as FDR, capturing mannerisms, attitudes and a gentle, genial sense of humor -- he deserves a better movie around this performance. Samuel West is obviously overshadowed by the ""Bertie"" of Colin Firth, but he's quite good as a young, green king who gains some confidence from his paternal American counterpart.Unfortunately, Laura Linney is utterly wasted here -- Daisy is a dowdy, perpetually downtridden blank with little personality of her own. And Colman is horrendously miscast as the Queen Mum, coming across as brittle and neurotic, like a suburban housewife who needs some Xanax.""Hyde Park on Hudson"" is a movie entirely made to win awards, not to be a story unto itself -- a few good performances and a few beautiful scenes, adrift in a soup of mediocrity.",2,Hyde-bound and limp,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,3710,"['When', 'big', 'dramatic', 'payoff', 'movie', 'King', 'England', 'eating', 'hot', 'dog', ""'ll"", 'have', 'mustard', 'know', ""'re"", 'trouble.So', 'Hyde', 'Park', 'Hudson', 'wishy-washy', 'little', 'movie', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'actual', 'movie', 'story', 'Daisy', 'Suckley', 'FDR', 'distant', 'relative', 'possible', 'lover', 'so', 'painfully', 'padded', 'out', 'spending', 'weekend', 'bunch', 'really', 'dull', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'nothing', 'dramatic', 'ever', 'up', 'anything.Daisy', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'summoned', 'sixth-cousin', 'Franklin', 'Delano', 'Roosevelt', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'who', 'president', 'US', 'years', 'approaching', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'confidante', 'friend', 'possibly', 'bit', 'more', 'see', 'wandering', 'hands', 'field', 'flowers', 'remaining', 'clueless', 'exact', 'nature', 'relationships', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'assistant', 'Elizabeth', 'Marvel', '.The', 'story', 'mostly', 'particular', 'couple', 'days', 'when', 'newly', 'crowned', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'Samuel', 'West', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Olivia', 'Colman', 'are', 'visiting', 'hopes', 'forging', 'alliance', 'Nazis', 'king', 'stay', 'Daisy', 'made', 'not-so-shockingly', 'aware', 'not', 'only', 'woman', 'cousin', 'life', 'Will', 'leave', 'settle', 'will', 'Bertie', 'eat', 'hot', 'dog', 'Seriously', 'DRAMA', 'One', 'question', 'kept', 'flitting', 'mind', 'watched', 'movie', 'What', 'point', 'ANYTHING', 'going', 'having', 'two', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'stories', 'flitting', 'Hyde', 'Park', 'Hudson', 'feeling', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'happened', 'least', 'nothing', 'important.Instead', 'director', 'Roger', 'Michell', 'everything', ""n't"", 'actually', 'matter', 'long-run', 'get', 'whole', 'scene', 'devoted', 'FDR', 'mother', 'freaking', 'out', ""n't"", 'want', 'son', 'offering', 'cocktails', 'guests', 'RIVETING', 'half', 'movie', 'watching', 'British', 'royals', 'twitter', 'fuss', 'other', 'half', 'watching', 'limp', 'lifeless', 'Daisy', 'wandering', 'around', 'looking', 'sad', 'are', 'few', 'blow-ups', 'Daisy', 'angry', 'FDR', 'royals', 'have', 'tiff', 'do', ""n't"", 'lead', 'anything.It', 'also', 'fairly', 'unpleasant', 'implications', 'such', 'Daisy', 'life', 'second-string', 'mistress', 'better', 'anything', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'FDR', 'cheats', 'Eleanor', 'just', 'mean', 'ol', 'lesbian', 'movie', 'even', 'ONLY', 'reason', 'America', 'became', 'embroiled', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'because', 'George', 'VI', 'charmed', 'Americans', 'eating', 'hot', 'dog', 'almost', 'farcical.About', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'movie', 'twenty-minute', 'period', 'charming', 'powerful', 'most', 'devoted', 'Bertie', 'FDR', 'having', 'candid', 'talk', 'vulnerabilities', 'feelings', 'other', 'lovely', 'low-key', 'scene', 'when', 'get', 'back', 'effing', 'hot', 'dogs.The', 'casting', 'pretty', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Murray', 'absolutely', 'transcendent', 'FDR', 'capturing', 'mannerisms', 'attitudes', 'gentle', 'genial', 'sense', 'humor', 'better', 'movie', 'performance', 'Samuel', 'West', 'obviously', 'overshadowed', 'Bertie', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'quite', 'good', 'young', 'green', 'king', 'who', 'gains', 'confidence', 'paternal', 'American', 'counterpart.Unfortunately', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'here', 'Daisy', 'dowdy', 'perpetually', 'downtridden', 'blank', 'little', 'personality', 'own', 'Colman', 'horrendously', 'miscast', 'Queen', 'Mum', 'coming', 'brittle', 'neurotic', 'suburban', 'housewife', 'who', 'Xanax', 'Hyde', 'Park', 'Hudson', 'movie', 'entirely', 'made', 'win', 'awards', 'not', 'be', 'story', 'unto', 'few', 'good', 'performances', 'few', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'adrift', 'soup', 'mediocrity']",N/A

Roger Michell, 2012, 95 minutes) My generation in my end of town was raised to venerate President Franklin Delano Roosevelt - though a few were raised to detest him and no one was really certain if they were right. As an adult I learned what this film teaches: depending on who one is, one sees FDR in the light one wishes. I always saw him as the wise rich man who knew how to relate, and worried about the working poor.This film was quite a shock no matter who one is or how one sees FDR. It is a one-dimensional, petty, clownishly minimalist joke. Centering on/narrated by Daisy (Laura Linney), FDR's 5th cousin once removed who has a steady affair with him throughout, the film showed several things I could certainly have lived without completely. Bill Murray's thin-as-paper cameos as FDR did not help, nor did his crude-sounding upper New York accent which of course is all wrong for FDR.This is not my main complaint. The time in which this is set centers around the Royal visit to the U.S., of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and hosted by FDR. The woefully miscast King (Samuel West, credited as ""Bertie"") and Queen (an eerily ugly Olivia Colman, credited as ""Elizabeth"") were portrayed as morons who seemed to hate one another. Eleanor Roosevelt (Olivia Williams) was not only passable but quite wonderful; as was Elizabeth Wilson as Mrs. Roosevelt, FDR's overbearing mother.This is precisely it. Some performances all right, most just plain awful, a one-track-minded endeavor by a somewhat clumsy director in my opinion. This film had nothing I wanted to see. Did I want to see a saintly FDR, a powerful King George? NO.Expecting, badly wanting accuracy, an epic sweep of about 2 hours' duration, some respect and a bit of well deserved timeliness, all I got was this soggy, sorry film. I always say the delivery system is everything. This one is like one of those pooped-out rockets the NAZIs kept launching. Though the details were beautiful (beautifully wasted as well) and they filmed at Hyde Park, the whole thing falls flat.Neither FDR, Eleanor, King George nor Queen Elizabeth deserved this hot mess. As for 5th-cousin-once-removed Daisy, I cannot fathom how you could take a film about FDR and such a vital moment in our history and change it into a film about Daisy.Save your dollars.

1621724,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00B4ZN3XQ,FNDNreview,"[1, 3]","Historical films have been all the rage lately (Lincoln, Argo, J. Edgar, The Iron Lady, etc.) and it's not that history films aren't exciting- but let's be honest here:  sometimes they really aren't all that exciting.  It goes without saying that we go to the movies to be entertained, but there's just something unsettling about paying to see films based on true stories, even though that story is twisted around in order to look good for entertainment purposes.  For instance, Titanic - love story aside - got the historical portions of the film correct, making for an all-around wonderful movie experience.  On the other hand, films like Pearl Harbor and The Patriot have the absolute opposite impact and are filled with fictitious events that have the ability to paint the wrong picture of historical events.  Making a film about questionable or even possibly fictitious events is dirty business, which also happens to be the case with Hyde Park on Hudson.Taking place in June 1939, Hyde Park on Hudson tells the true story of President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Bill Murray) hosting King George VI (Samuel West) and Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) as they visit America in an attempt to get the United States to aid England during World War II.  It also focuses on the personal and intimate relationship between President Roosevelt and his distant cousin, Margaret Suckley (Laura Linney).  Olivia Williams and Elizabeth Marvel also star in supporting roles.As far as a biographical film goes, Hyde Park on Hudson tells an interesting story that people might not know as it pertains to the relationship between the United States and England in 1939.  Indeed, the relationship was still strained from the wars that these two countries had had with one another, so it makes for some interesting, dramatic, and awkward moments between these two nation's leaders.  At the same time, it's a film that is difficult to care about in the sense that you never get to fully grasp the urgency during this particular time in history.  England badly needed the help of the United States, yet this film is nothing more than a glorified dinner party with FDR, his wife, the King and Queen of England, and - oh yeah, a handful of FDR's mistresses.Supposedly, you're to believe that FDR had an intimate relationship with Margaret Suckley, even though you never actually see them being intimate.  Bill Murray and Laura Linney are both exquisite actors, but they never seem to click together in this film.  At certain points, it feels as though these two characters aren't even in the same movie, let alone in each other's lives.  However, Murray really does a superb job of portraying the great FDR, but for a film that is meant to devote half of its energy on a relationship between FDR and Suckley, it just doesn't seem authentic - not to mention it's quite possible that their intimate relationship is historically fictitious.  The jury is still out on that one.  Regardless, its very apparent that FDR, JFK, and Bill Clinton had a lot in common as it pertains to their personal lives.Overall, the story was a good idea to tell - but is done with poor execution.  The characters are too bubbly, often times stuck up and hard to relate to or care about.  And, since caring about characters is essential to a film's success, it's hard to call this film anything other than a failed production.If you want information about the suposed love FDR, read a book instead.Overall Film Grade:  CFNDNreview.com",2,Better off reading a book about FDR,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,3485,"['Historical', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'rage', 'lately', 'Lincoln', 'Argo', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'etc', 'not', 'history', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'exciting-', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'here', 'sometimes', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'exciting', 'saying', 'go', 'movies', 'be', 'entertained', 'just', 'something', 'unsettling', 'paying', 'see', 'films', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'even', 'story', 'twisted', 'order', 'look', 'good', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'instance', 'Titanic', 'love', 'story', 'aside', 'got', 'historical', 'portions', 'film', 'correct', 'making', 'all-around', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'experience', 'other', 'hand', 'films', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Patriot', 'have', 'absolute', 'opposite', 'impact', 'are', 'filled', 'fictitious', 'events', 'have', 'ability', 'paint', 'wrong', 'picture', 'historical', 'events', 'Making', 'film', 'questionable', 'even', 'possibly', 'fictitious', 'events', 'dirty', 'business', 'also', 'be', 'case', 'Hyde', 'Park', 'Hudson.Taking', 'place', 'June', '1939', 'Hyde', 'Park', 'Hudson', 'true', 'story', 'President', 'Franklin', 'D.', 'Roosevelt', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'hosting', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'Samuel', 'West', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Olivia', 'Colman', 'visit', 'America', 'attempt', 'get', 'United', 'States', 'aid', 'England', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'also', 'personal', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'President', 'Roosevelt', 'distant', 'cousin', 'Margaret', 'Suckley', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Elizabeth', 'Marvel', 'also', 'supporting', 'roles.As', 'far', 'biographical', 'film', 'Hyde', 'Park', 'Hudson', 'interesting', 'story', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'relationship', 'United', 'States', 'England', '1939', 'Indeed', 'relationship', 'was', 'still', 'strained', 'wars', 'two', 'countries', 'had', 'had', 'one', 'interesting', 'dramatic', 'awkward', 'moments', 'two', 'nation', 'leaders', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'difficult', 'care', 'sense', 'never', 'get', 'fully', 'grasp', 'urgency', 'particular', 'time', 'history', 'England', 'badly', 'needed', 'help', 'United', 'States', 'yet', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'glorified', 'dinner', 'party', 'FDR', 'wife', 'King', 'Queen', 'England', 'oh', 'yeah', 'handful', 'FDR', 'mistresses.Supposedly', ""'re"", 'believe', 'FDR', 'had', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'Margaret', 'Suckley', 'even', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'being', 'intimate', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'are', 'exquisite', 'actors', 'never', 'seem', 'click', 'together', 'film', 'certain', 'points', 'two', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'same', 'movie', 'let', 'alone', 'other', 'lives', 'However', 'Murray', 'really', 'superb', 'job', 'portraying', 'great', 'FDR', 'film', 'meant', 'devote', 'half', 'energy', 'relationship', 'FDR', 'Suckley', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'authentic', 'not', 'mention', 'quite', 'possible', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'historically', 'fictitious', 'jury', 'still', 'out', 'one', 'Regardless', 'very', 'apparent', 'FDR', 'JFK', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'had', 'lot', 'common', 'personal', 'lives.Overall', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'tell', 'done', 'poor', 'execution', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'bubbly', 'often', 'stuck', 'up', 'hard', 'relate', 'care', 'caring', 'characters', 'essential', 'film', 'success', 'hard', 'call', 'film', 'anything', 'other', 'failed', 'production.If', 'want', 'information', 'suposed', 'love', 'FDR', 'read', 'book', 'instead.Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'CFNDNreview.com']",N/A

1621730,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00B4ZN3XQ,Grady Harp,"[26, 31]","Two noticeable aspects on this site - the paucity of reviews of this period piece film and the number of negative comments that seem to blanket the responses to this very quiet little recreation of a moment in history about which few may be aware. In many ways this film, as written by Richard Nelson and directed by Roger Michell, resembles a little European art film: the recreation of conditions in the USA in the post Depression era are remarkably apt and set a fine tenor for the story (including the musical score!). In the end this is a tale about how men in powerful places interrelate in moments of tension and how those same men have flaws both physical and in character that would weigh down ordinary fellows. But the story is about a particular summer in when Britain, on the brink of war with Hitler, visited America, hoping for Allied assistance in the war that was to become World War II.The setting is the home away form the White House - Hyde Park on the Hudson, the home of FDR's mother (Elizabeth Wilson) who still ruled the roost despite her son's political role. FDR is enchantingly portrayed by Bill Murray who is able to show all sides of FDR's personality - his response to being a victim of polio, his wisdom at running a country beaten down by the Depression, and his need for multiple liaisons with women. In one household we meet Missy (Elizabeth Marvel) who has been both secretary and lover of some time, Daisy (Laura Linney) who is FDR's fifth cousin who enters the coterie because of her honesty and genuine affection for FDR, and we hear about `Mrs Rutherford', yet another of FDR's affairs, and of course there is the presence of Eleanor Roosevelt (a superb Olivia Williams). Though the film seems to want to emphasize the development and course of FDR's affair with Daisy, the story gratefully focuses on the visit from The King and Queen of England - a first: Bertie (Samuel West) stutters his way into the favor of FDR while Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) tolerates her King-husband's lack of social graces and holds a lifted nose to the crude Americans. The highlight of the film is a glorious scene of a conversation between Bertie and FDR regarding their personal physical embarrassments and their joint worldviews. In the end there is a picnic where all comes to resolution.For this viewer the portrayal by Bill Murray was a revelation for this actor. His version of FDR is a fine blend of humor, vulnerability, pride overcoming his need to be carried everywhere because of his paralysis, and his genuine sense of kindness and caring for his people. If his flaw was promiscuity, given the times and the presence of the powerful and stand-alone wife, it is a minor one. Laura Linney's Daisy is somewhat of a frump, kind and sensitive but clumsy, and has little to do except voice-over narration. But the rest of the cast is superb.  This is a film that deserves a much wider audience than it has received.

In September, Hitler will invade Poland, and England and France will end almost a decade of delusional, self-defeating appeasement, which has only made Hitler stronger.  Within the year, France will have fallen to the Third Reich, and England will be left to stand alone, saved only by Hitler's disastrous blunder (invading the USSR) and awaiting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that will bring the US into the war, two years almost too late.FDR, knowing that things are slipping out of control, invites the royal couple to add a US visit to their Canadian trip, so he can use them to put a human face on Britain, for the isolationist American public.  It's the beginning of a beautiful friendship, of sorts;  or as Winston Churchill would put it ""America can always be counted on to do the right thing, after it's tried all the other options.""  So, after two days of formality in D.C., the two power couples decamp to Roosevelt's Hudson Valley estate at Hyde Park, where the King wins America's heart by eating a hot dog.We're kind of simple that way...This film opens in Hyde Park, at the nearby estate of a distant Roosevelt cousin, Daisy, who is summoned to the FDR compound there by his mother, Sara, who says her son feels lonely (He already has a wife, and a mistress, but a mother's concern knows no bounds). The call can barely be heard over the yapping of a black scotty, which if memory serves, the movie neglects to tie in:  It's cousin Daisy who gave FDR his famous black scotty Fala.For all intents and purposes, this is a romantic film about FDR and Daisy, and could have been titled ""I Pleasured The President (And Met The King And Queen of England)"" as it seems that on one cross country drive FDR puts Daisy's hand in his lap, and I don't mean by his knees...  They don't get much into what actually happened between them (she seems to have come into the picture just as he is learning to walk, again, after being stricken with polio) and the King and Queen are little more than props.  This is the same stuttering George VI of which a full movie was made quite recently, but Queen Elizabeth (the mother of the current Q-Liz) is nothing more than a fretting, frowning, worry-wart, none of her fortitude or sense of humor comes through whatsoever.So, you've just read far more history than the movie even tries to suggest, thus if you opt to watch this film, your only question will be:  Why the hell can't I rent it?  I had to reinstate dvd's on my Netflix account to watch this film, so no, I'm not advocating you spend the money to purchase it.

Ralph Bellamy (on stage, in film, and on television), Edward Herrmann (on television and in a Hollywood musical), Ralph Vaughn, Jon Voight, David Ogden Stiers, and Kenneth Branagh have each brought their own skills to bear in interpreting this complex man - a figure at once tangible and elusive.Of course, many films have dealt with historical figures and or situations. Some have used historical events as backgrounds for a fictional story, usually Romantic - such as Titanic and Pearl Harbor. In those cases, real-life figures are relegated to supporting roles. Others have placed the historical figure dead center in the production - dead usually being the operative word. Too often, historical biographies are like animated wax museums: the Important Events in a lifetime are recreated in the span of a few hours with little insight given into the person's character, into what drove these flesh and blood people. The miniseries on John Adams is the finest example I've seen - the seven hour running time gave the writers and producers adequate time to flesh out the characters.Sadly such is not the case with Hyde Park on Hudson, which is neither a biographical film nor a historical melodrama. HPoH isn't merely the weakest film I've ever seen on FDR, it's the worst film on a U. S. President I've ever seen, period. How bad is HPoH? Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter, and FDR American Badass - neither of which was intended to be taken seriously - are masterpieces by comparison.Whether a play, TV show, or film: if it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage. With a strong script, nearly any production's flaws can be overlooked. When the script is weak, ""all the kings horses and all the kings men..."" - and the screenplay for HPoH is God-awful. It makes no attempt at a dramatic through-line, with no sense of a beginning or ending, nor character development. Indeed, the characters are two-dimensional and, frankly, uninteresting. Then there are the ""liberties"" taken with history.There is so much outright falsehood that it's hard to know where to begin. But let's start at a central plot element, the film's portrayal of FDR's ""affair"" with distant cousin Margaret ""Daisy"" Suckley. A typical scene has FDR driving Daisy in his manually controlled Ford, waving off the Secret Service, and then parking with Daisy in a field - whereupon she provides her own ""manual"" service to the President.FDR was no plaster saint, he had a multitude of character defects: devious, manipulative, and ruthless. FDR was also an unfaithful husband. He had an affair with Lucy Mercer and more than likely with Marguerite ""Missy"" LeHand. Both Lucy and Daisy were with FDR in Warm Springs when was stricken by a fatal stroke - Missy had died the previous year. (The idea that Lucy and Daisy both had affairs with FDR and then spent time together as if they were aging sorority sisters boggles the mind.) HPoH's portrayal of Daisy's relationship with FDR as anything more than a friendship between a magnetic, complicated man and his spinster, sixth cousin is not only fanciful, it's defamatory. HPoH bears no resemblance to Daisy's diaries of their time together, which were published after her death in 1991. If there was any special aspect to FDR's relationship with Daisy, it's that he revealed more of himself emotionally than he did with the rest of his circle - it was to Daisy alone than he confided what a burden the Presidency was becoming to him, how much he wanted to retire, and his worries about his health. His trust in Daisy was such that two of the very rare photographs of FDR in a wheelchair were taken by her. There were dozens of women, and not a few men, whose lives revolved around doting on FDR. There was a certain effervescence about him that made people want to spend time with him. Indeed, Winston Churchill wrote that meeting FDR was ""like opening your first bottle of champagne"". Adoration does not necessarily equal sexual conjugation.I would also add that Daisy was nowhere near as attractive as Laura Linney, an actress I have to feel sorry for after seeing HPoH. I've followed Linney's career with interest since she first appeared as Mary Ann Singleton in Tales of the City back in 1993. More recently, she did a compelling star turn as Abigail Adams. But here she has little to do but hide behind a veil of demure coyness. If Linney's agent recommended this movie for her, he should be fired.Bill Murray neither looks nor sounds like FDR. Worse, he makes little effort to look or sound like him, from the way he wears his pince-nez, to the angle of his cigarette holder, to the timbre and accent of his voice.  Nor is Murray able to recreate the halting walk FDR taught himself after becoming paralyzed in 1921. (The only actor I've seen recreate FDR's walk convincingly is Edward Herrmann.) The man whose crippled legs were masked by the determination and iron will that allowed him to guide America through the Great Depression and World War II is nowhere to be seen here. As portrayed by Murray, FDR is merely a cocktail swilling, dilettante and bon-vivant who happens to be President of the United States - when he's not too busy soliciting ""favors"" from the women in his life. I have to wonder whether Murray has read even one of the many biographies about FDR before taking this role.Olivia Williams is entirely miscast as Eleanor Roosevelt. Nothing of the real vitality that attracted Franklin to her is here (shortly before his death, FDR told his son that even after 40 years of marriage, Eleanor was still ""the most fascinating woman"" he'd ever met), only hints that she sought companionship from other women. Nor is the passion for social justice that fueled Eleanor from her adolescence until her death. Here, she's merely an irritatable quasi new-age ditz.Not everything about HPoH is completely terrible.  Samuel West and Olivia Colman turn in excellent, perfectly timed, performances as England's King and Queen.  Olivia Williams is fine as FDR's mother, although why she uses a slightly foreign accent when the real Sara Delano Roosevelt was born in New York is puzzling to me.  The propmaster does an excellent job recreating the look of 1939.But HPoH suffers from a split personality: for the most part, it's a comedic culture clash about the British Royals' visit to America; then it becomes a clumsy, angsty drama about a philandering President's multiple affairs.  The latter plotline could have been entirely dropped and the film would have been much stronger.The exterior of Springwood looks nothing like the real thing (I've been there). I can certainly understand why the Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park would decline to allow this tripe to be filmed on location, but couldn't the filmmakers have created a CGI version?In short, Hyde Park on Hudson is not historically accurate. Worse to some, it's not entertaining - not even as a low-sex comedy, as it's too slow moving. The writer, the producers, and Murray himself should be embarrassed they ever committed to this project.",2,Travesty in Hyde Park on Hudson,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,7112,"['Franklin', 'Delano',

1621743,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B00B4ZN3XQ,John D. Cofield,"[2, 3]","This entertaining little film is the story of a powerful man in some of his more private moments.  It's loosely based on the book ""Closest Companion: The Unknown Story of the Intimate Friendship between Franklin Roosevelt and Margaret Suckley,"" edited and annotated by Geoffrey C. Ward.  Daisy Suckley was a distant cousin of Roosevelt's, and during the 1930s she became one of his close friends, someone he could rely on for companionship and support.  FDR had had a number of these friendships over the years, including Lucy Mercer Rutherford (with whom he had a physical love affair that nearly ended his marriage), his secretary Missy LeHand, another distant cousin Laura Delano, and others.  Especially in the years after polio crippled him they gave him something his wife Eleanor, influential and powerful in her own right, apparently could or would not.This film does a good job depicting Roosevelt and Daisy's friendship, especially during an important weekend in 1939 when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the first British monarchs to visit the US, were guests at Hyde Park.  Hyde Park was and is a splendid old mansion on the Hudson River which in the 1930s belonged to Roosevelt's indomitable mother Sara Delano Roosevelt. The King and Queen spent a private weekend there, famously being served hot dogs at a picnic organized by the First Lady. It was a critical moment for the British, who were on the verge of war with Germany.  King George VI had just come to the throne two years earlier when his older brother suddenly abdicated, and with his stammer and shyness he did not cut an impressive figure.  In the film we see FDR offering him encouragement and good advice that apparently stood him in good stead.I enjoyed this film very much.  I've read quite a bit about both the Roosevelts and the King and Queen, and their depictions are accurate for the most part.

This film delivers a superb &#34;stage&#34; that replicates the time & place where FDR's personal relationships are played out congruently with the pressures of the political climate that he bore and collectively defined him as a man and beloved president.  The film depicts how the people and the press of that era chose not to sit in judgment and promote his physical limitations and rumors whispered of relationships outside his marriage: a marriage in which his wife could not endure the prospect of birthing more children - withdrawing her physical relationship with him and pursuing a lesbian relationship. She continued to be his legs and right arm - traveling throughout the country connecting with the people and gathering information on their plight. He loved her for that overlooked when her own political agenda went beyond his own;  and, lastly, the ever-present and unavoidable stresses of dealing with a controlling  mother whose love and financial support was a double-edged sword throughout his lifetime.The film depicts how deeply he loved and cared for people. How non-judgmental he was of the personal short-comings of others and vocal in his support of their strengths. He was the voice of the masses and centered all his governing priorities on improving the circumstances of the common man. I was particularly taken with the portrayal of his ability to exude cheerfulness - to seek out the joy  - however small - found in living in the moment. He would not allow all the distractions of the dire circumstances pressed upon him and those he loved to take away a measure of happiness a sunny afternoon might present.  The county's strength was held together in great part by a desire to believe in his persona of moral-based values and strength of character, while choosing to place little stock in his state of  declining personal health.... because he chose to ignore it himself until the very end. History remembers him not for his personal weaknesses and physical limitations but as the most beloved president who saw the nation through the most trying of times and governed with grit and optimism and governing &#34;by and for the people&#34;.",5,A superb historic replication of the time & place in which FDR's personal relationships defined him as a man and president,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,2581,"['FDR', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'rock', 'American', 'drew', 'strength', 'pull', 'up', 'boot-straps', 'overcome', 'devastating', 'personal', 'losses', 'dealt', 'Great', 'Depression', 'then', 'build', 'nation', 'tools', 'war', 'so', 'join', 'win', 'fight', 'preserve', 'freedoms', 'allies', 'threatened', 'Hitler', 'Japanese', 'winning', 'WW2', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'film', 'superb', '34', 'stage', '34', 'time', 'place', 'where', 'FDR', 'personal', 'relationships', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'congruently', 'pressures', 'political', 'climate', 'bore', 'collectively', 'defined', 'man', 'beloved', 'president', 'film', 'how', 'people', 'press', 'era', 'chose', 'not', 'sit', 'judgment', 'promote', 'physical', 'limitations', 'rumors', 'whispered', 'relationships', 'marriage', 'marriage', 'wife', 'could', 'not', 'endure', 'prospect', 'birthing', 'more', 'children', 'withdrawing', 'physical', 'relationship', 'pursuing', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'continued', 'be', 'legs', 'right', 'arm', 'traveling', 'country', 'connecting', 'people', 'gathering', 'information', 'plight', 'loved', 'overlooked', 'when', 'own', 'political', 'agenda', 'went', 'own', 'lastly', 'ever-present', 'unavoidable', 'stresses', 'dealing', 'controlling', 'mother', 'love', 'financial', 'support', 'was', 'double-edged', 'sword', 'lifetime.The', 'film', 'how', 'deeply', 'loved', 'cared', 'people', 'How', 'non-judgmental', 'was', 'personal', 'short-comings', 'others', 'vocal', 'support', 'strengths', 'was', 'voice', 'masses', 'centered', 'governing', 'priorities', 'improving', 'circumstances', 'common', 'man', 'was', 'particularly', 'taken', 'portrayal', 'ability', 'exude', 'cheerfulness', 'seek', 'out', 'joy', 'however', 'small', 'found', 'living', 'moment', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'distractions', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'pressed', 'loved', 'take', 'away', 'measure', 'happiness', 'sunny', 'afternoon', 'might', 'present', 'county', 'strength', 'was', 'held', 'together', 'great', 'part', 'desire', 'believe', 'persona', 'moral-based', 'values', 'strength', 'character', 'choosing', 'place', 'little', 'stock', 'state', 'declining', 'personal', 'health', 'chose', 'ignore', 'very', 'end', 'History', 'remembers', 'not', 'personal', 'weaknesses', 'physical', 'limitations', 'most', 'beloved', 'president', 'who', 'saw', 'nation', 'most', 'trying', 'times', 'governed', 'grit', 'optimism', 'governing', '34', 'people', '34']",N/A

It's always hard to know in biopic's what's reality and what's the director's imagination, but in this case the picture that is painted is highly interesting and engaging, historical accuracy and faithfulness questions aside. Murray depicts FDR as a very human larger-than-life figure brought into sharp focus during the bits where an assistant carries him from place to place. This could be enormously humiliating for the average Joe, but Murray succeeds in capturing a whole host of reactions to this necessary inconvenience on the part of FDR: there is a whiff of humiliation (but just a whiff), more amusement, a good bit of lordliness and almost smugness. Really well done. There are a lot of remarkable aspects to the story depicted here, not the least of which is that the subject of FDR's physical restrictions are almost never dealt with directly although they are always present. It's almost as if his physical disability is a minor intrusion or inconvenience more than a life altering challenge. His very full life is awe-inspiring; his physical limitations did not stop him from achieving remarkable things, and although not at all the focus of the film, this reality gives one pause when pondering the meaning of the word &#34;disability.&#34; The message is all the more powerful because that is not the focus of the film at all.",4,Bill Murray is terrific,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,1400,"['thought', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'enlightening', 'always', 'hard', 'know', 'biopic', 'what', 'reality', 'what', 'director', 'imagination', 'case', 'picture', 'painted', 'highly', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'faithfulness', 'questions', 'aside', 'Murray', 'FDR', 'very', 'human', 'larger-than-life', 'figure', 'brought', 'sharp', 'focus', 'bits', 'where', 'assistant', 'place', 'place', 'could', 'be', 'enormously', 'humiliating', 'average', 'Joe', 'Murray', 'capturing', 'whole', 'host', 'reactions', 'necessary', 'inconvenience', 'part', 'FDR', 'whiff', 'humiliation', 'just', 'whiff', 'more', 'amusement', 'good', 'bit', 'lordliness', 'almost', 'smugness', 'Really', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'lot', 'remarkable', 'aspects', 'story', 'depicted', 'here', 'not', 'least', 'subject', 'FDR', 'physical', 'restrictions', 'are', 'almost', 'never', 'dealt', 'directly', 'are', 'always', 'present', 'almost', 'physical', 'disability', 'minor', 'intrusion', 'inconvenience', 'more', 'life', 'altering', 'challenge', 'very', 'full', 'life', 'awe-inspiring', 'physical', 'limitations', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'achieving', 'remarkable', 'things', 'not', 'focus', 'film', 'reality', 'one', 'pause', 'when', 'pondering', 'meaning', 'word', '34', 'disability.', '34', 'message', 'more', 'powerful', 'not', 'focus', 'film']",N/A

Oleson,"[1, 1]","On the cusp of going to war with Germany, King George (""Bertie"") and his Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) become the first British royals to visit America.  The King (Samuel West), realizing that England may become toast at the hands of the emerging Nazi juggernaut, approaches President Franklin Roosevelt (a charming Bill Murray) to gain U. S. support, both financially and militarily.  Thus the stage is set at Roosevelt's getaway home, still owned by his aging mother (Elizabeth Wilson).It should come as no surprise that the marriage between Franklin and Eleanor (Olivia Williams) is more of a business arrangement at this point.  Franklin had strayed many times including times with a married woman (never seen) as well as his secretary Missy (Elizabeth Marvel).  Looking for someone to help take Franklin's mind off matters of state, his mother would often call relatives to come and visit.  This time she contacts a 5th cousin, Daisy (Laura Linney) and requests a visit.  Franklin and Daisy quickly become close.  Very close.While various dalliances are in play, Franklin and ""Bertie"" manage to hit it off to the point that the King even eats a hot dog at a planned picnic.  This is a headline maker that seems to equate the King of England with being just another guy.  The idea would seem to be an important element in drawing America into the war.The affairs are not very titillating, outside Daisy masturbating Franklin in his car, and that's probably a good thing.  The problem is that this is all pretty boring stuff.  The best parts of the film are the exchanges between Franklin and ""Bertie.""  I will also point out that the sets and photography are very well done.  There are some terrific night scenes that are beautifully shot.  The designers did a great job acquiring vintage cars and interior set pieces.  It all seemed very authentic.  While not overly enthusiastic about the story, the film provides some insight into a brief period of American and British cooperation as well as a peek at Roosevelt's not so secret private life.I thought the Blu ray transfer was excellent.  It comes at 1080p resolution and has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  The detail is excellent, especially in the close ups.  Murray's Roosevelt has a blotchy scab over his left eyebrow that was never explained in the script, but is clearly visible. The fine audio track is in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and while it is purposely conservative, it is always clear and well balanced.  The filmmakers make good use of the music of the day which is well presented in the surround format.

1621782,A192Z1UVDNK88E,B00B4ZN3XQ,Mom of Sons,"[1, 2]","Oh, I wanted to love this movie. Let's hit the positives first: Bill Murray deserves his Golden Globe nomination here for his interesting and low key performance as President Franklin D. Roosevelt. All the acting was very good. And the movie was rich in beautiful, authentic period detail, the Roosevelt home in Hyde Park, New York, and the environs.The negatives: even at only about 90 minutes, the movie dragged. I fell asleep briefly a couple of times, and it didn't seem to affect my understanding of the plot at all. To say the movie is a ""simplistic"" look at that extremely complex historical time is a massive understatement. Most of the time, the movie focuses only on its very narrow subject: the leader of the free world finds much-needed R&R; in his home in tony Hyde Park, far away from Washington. The looming war and the Great Depression are sub-plots and no depth is attached to those topics in this story, nor do we see the POTUS discharging many (any?) presidential duties.I'm not an FDR scholar, but was this (I thought) heroic man actually a weak, sad, fumbling mama's boy, and a womanizer? That is kind of the image I'm left with, after watching this movie.At movie's end, a statement appears onscreen, ""America eventually agreed to help Great Britain..."" in World War II. Um, a little thing called Pearl Harbor was, I thought, what propelled America into WWII. No matter.

1621809,A23F8D2ZOCQM6V,B00B4ZN3XQ,rctnyc,"[20, 28]","I want to thank the producers of this god-awful film for sending me running to Geoffrey Ward's ""Closest Companion,"" the edited version of Daisy Suckley's diaries and the Suckley-Roosevelt correspondence that tells the real story of their special friendship.  Having read many accounts of the Roosevelt administration and New Deal, including bios of FDR (Kearns Goodwin, Smith) and Eleanor (Wieson Cook), I was looking forward to ""Hyde Park on the Hudson""  I admire Murray and Linney, whose talents are wasted on this turgid, maudlin soap opera that takes heaps and heaps of liberties with history, distorting the characters of all concerned -- Suckley, FDR, Eleanor and the Royals -- and depicting and conflicts that almost certainly did not -- as certain as we can be w/o having been there, which these producers most assuredly were not -- occur.Suckley was an upper-crust Hudson Valley lady, a sixth cousin of FDR, who become his devoted companion and best friend.  Although they had some kind of intimate moment once, on a hill that became the site of Top Cottage, Daisy's comments about sex (she rarely kissed him, even affectionately) and proper behavior, and general naivete, are clear throughout the text.  While the film suggests that Suckley shared FDR, sexually, with Missy LeHand, his secretary, her diaries and their correspondence reveal only an ongoing very close friendship in which, as Suckley says, she and another cousin, Laura Delano acted first as companions -- Eleanor was nowhere to be seen -- and finally as loving caregivers to an increasingly frail Roosevelt, whom Suckley clearly worshipped. Suckley's diaries and the FDR/Suckley letters tell a fascinating ""insiders"" tale, not of sexual adventures, but rather of the Roosevelt administration during the late 1930s and WWII and life among the wealthy during that period.  We read about the drafting of the Atlantic Charter and Roosevelt's meetings with Churchill and Stalin -- from Roosevelt's uncensored point of view -- and learn Suckley's impressions and FDR's views regarding the members of his administration and many foreign leaders.  The passages on Churchill are wonderful, providing a close-up account of that great statesman and casting additional light on his relationship with FDR.The reduction of the complex, loving friendship between two remarkable people to a soap opera in which Suckley is portrayed as mentally screaming ""You bastard!"" at a cheating Roosevelt, having sexual relations of a sort with him in his car and playing cards with Missy LeHand, is Hollywood at its most callow, silly and pitiable. Also unintentionally funny  -- although my spouse, a history major, was too outraged to laugh; he kept shouting ""What! What!  This is outrageous!"" while I tittered.In short, read the Ward book.  You will come to love Daisy and to appreciate her devotion to FDR.  You will also learn a lot about history, from the inside.

Obviously, it's a story that cannot be properly shared without an invasion of privacy, thus a candid emotional intimacy. HPoHudson is a novel on stilts, so, each new idea is played out with a patience, color and subtlety common to reality and the written word.Although the cinematography is good, giving us landscapes, discomfiting close-ups and descriptive shots gorgeous enough to be consumed as overpriced watercolors, it is the relationship between FDR and his distant cousin that pulls us along --which leads me to assert that the acting is also very good. Laura Linney, as usual, plays sweet, pained and transparent Daisy with such an ease we forget we've seen her do it before. Bill Murray's excessively jovial flawed father figure is slightly less believable, but only because the portrayal is of FDR. His actual performance is seamless.The disappointment expressed by other reviewers is understandable. My advice? Don't trust the trailer. This movie is well put together, boasting a solid score, intriguing characters, lively action and a historical connection with a highly theatrical draw, but there are three side stories swirling around the two mugs they put on the box and the posters. The central story disappoints.If you watch this film, enjoy the beauty created from the story boards and shot in nature, the accurate wardrobe. Follow the excellent characterization of Elizabeth and Bertie, played 'smashingly' by Samuel West and Olivia Coleman. Let your mind dance around the possible truths and bigger myths of our former first lady, Eleanor.If you watch this film, remember it's a period piece, a high-spirited, languid, misty, filtered, contradictory memoire.HPoHudson was carefully crafted by those participating mystical movie mavens.

Daisy lives with and takes care of her aunt, rubbing her legs and putting on her stockings for her in the morning. Daisy is timid and unsure of herself, and is honored to be in the presence of FDR. They take rides every day in his specially fitted car, because Eleanor doesn't want to (or so he says). After sharing apparently intimate moments with FDR, Daisy believes that she is someone special to him (although she is not invited to the dinner they give to the King and Queen of England). Daisy finds out that he is also intimate with his secretary Missy, and Missy tells her, some rich woman who built a house near the house he built, for when he retired. She is devastated. But Missy persuades her that she will accept this and ""share"" FDR with them. Since she's such a wimp, she does. But Daisy had a very dull boring life. What did it matter to her if she spent time with FDR or with Missy? It was companionship that she needed. But she could have at least gotten him to buy her a new hat! She wears the same pathetic little straw hat throughout.After the special dinner, the king wants to talk privately with FDR.  He has a speech which says something about how terrible war is and children being bombed. But then they get on to his stutter and FDR's polio, and how people only see what they want to see, etc.  They have some good laughs and become good buds and FDR decides to befriend England (the king was so nervous he wouldn't) and join them in war as if it's no big deal.There is a big fuss with the hot dogs at the picnic for the King and Queen. The Queen Mum doesn't like it and said his brother would never eat a hot dog. Why not? Anyway, the king eats one but it doesn't show if she does or not.I could never forget that Bill Murray was playing FDR. There was a lot of gunk on his face but it was just distracting and made me think ""That's Bill Murray"" all the more. I also kept thinking that ""Missy"" was being played by Jane Alexander, but had to remind myself, ""No, that can't be.""This movie didn't do much for me.

There is irony intricately laced within the dialouge of the scenes.

At the same time, according to the film, Roosevelt was pursuing an extramarital affair with a distant cousin, Daisy Suckley (Laura Linney).Richard Nelson's script portrays Roosevelt as both a master of political gamesmanship and a manipulator of the women around him -- wife Eleanor (Olivia Williams), Daisy, and his private secretary, Missy (Elizabeth Marvel).  Murray, who might not seem a first choice to portray Roosevelt, conveys both the President's charm and a dark side rarely seen in public. His Roosevelt is surely the ideal host, going out of his way to make his guests feel comfortable, happy, and welcome.The film has a voyeuristic quality, with the audience as willing spectators checking out a Roosevelt who balances work and play while under enormous pressures from both his public responsibilities and private peccadilloes.  It bogs down somewhat in a soap-opera subplot about Daisy discovering that she is only one in a long line of the President's lovers but, overall, the picture has a light touch and moves along briskly.Bonus features on the Blu-ray and DVD releases include deleted",3,A Busy Weekend for FDR,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1355,"['Hyde', 'Park', 'Hudson', 'stars', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Frankin', 'D.Roosevelt', 'place', 'summer', 'weekend', '1939', 'Hudson', 'Valley', 'estate', 'when', 'hosted', 'England', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'Samuel', 'West', 'who', 'hoped', 'gain', 'America', 'support', 'coming', 'war', 'same', 'time', 'according', 'film', 'Roosevelt', 'was', 'pursuing', 'extramarital', 'affair', 'distant', 'cousin', 'Daisy', 'Suckley', 'Laura', 'Linney', '.Richard', 'Nelson', 'script', 'Roosevelt', 'master', 'political', 'gamesmanship', 'manipulator', 'women', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Daisy', 'private', 'secretary', 'Missy', 'Elizabeth', 'Marvel', 'Murray', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'seem', 'first', 'choice', 'portray', 'Roosevelt', 'President', 'charm', 'dark', 'side', 'rarely', 'seen', 'public', 'Roosevelt', 'surely', 'ideal', 'host', 'going', 'way', 'make', 'guests', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'happy', 'welcome.The', 'film', 'voyeuristic', 'quality', 'audience', 'willing', 'spectators', 'checking', 'out', 'Roosevelt', 'who', 'work', 'play', 'enormous', 'pressures', 'public', 'responsibilities', 'private', 'peccadilloes', 'bogs', 'down', 'somewhat', 'soap-opera', 'subplot', 'Daisy', 'discovering', 'only', 'one', 'long', 'line', 'President', 'lovers', 'overall', 'picture', 'light', 'touch', 'moves', 'briskly.Bonus', 'features', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'releases', 'include', 'deleted']",N/A

King George VI (portrayed by Colin Firth in ""The King's Speech"") has travelled with an important objective, but what they see and do at the president's house is something unexpected, sometimes not so pleasant.Thus ""Hyde Park on Hudson"" provides two storylines, none of which is fully developed.

1621842,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00B4ZN3XQ,Turfseer,"[3, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0'Hyde Park on Hudson' reminded me a little of another indie film, 'My Weekend with Marilyn'. Both deal in limited moment in time 'behind-the scene' peeks in the life of iconic historical figures, told through the eyes of an interloper. In the latter case, it was Marilyn Monroe's short time on the set of the 1957 Lawrence Olivier film, 'Prince and the Show Girl', narrated by a young man, employed as a director's assistant. In 'Hyde Park', the setting is June 1939, when King George and Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) pay a visit to President Roosevelt at his Hyde Park estate. This 'slice in time' is narrated by a distant cousin of FDR's, Margaret 'Daisy' Suckley, who ends up as one of the president's mistresses.'Hyde Park' seeks to reveal the personal life of FDR as opposed to his political life. Bill Murray does a decent enough job as FDR and of course using Murray due to his star power, certainly didn't hurt the film at the box office. I wonder, on the other hand, if there could have been another actor out there who could have done an even better job, showing us what FDR was really like.Probably one of the most interesting aspects of the film is the way the press took a 'hands off' policy towards FDR's polio handicap. It's a little shocking to see one of the president's assistants, carrying him into the house through a back door, after all the press and guests have walked in through the front door. But that's exactly the way it was.There's not a great amount of drama per see in 'Hyde Park on Hudson'. The film mainly focuses on two concerns: the Royal visit and FDR's infidelities.As for the Royal Visit, Queen Elizabeth almost comes off as the antagonist, as she whines about some old American political cartoons from the War of 1812 that FDR put up in their guest room. Apparently, the Queen did not care for the depiction of the British officers. Her inflexibility is apparent since of course the pictures are a little over 125 years old.King George comes off as much more dignified. As in the recent Academy Award winner 'The Kings Speech', the King must deal with a stuttering problem. In perhaps the best scene in the film, he has a personal conversation with FDR who reassures him that his stuttering is not really noticeable (after all FDR must deal with a handicap fall worse than the King's). There is also reassurance coming from FDR, on America's support for Britain, at the eve of World War II.The rest of 'Hyde Park' deals with FDR's various affairs. Laura Linney as Daisy makes it clear that Eleanor Roosevelt accepted FDR's liaisons with other women but their relationship was not at all strained. Unfortunately, in this film, we see little of Eleanor, who does not play a big role in the plot.One scene that many critics didn't care for was when FDR ditches the Secret Service and has a moment of 'intimacy' with Daisy inside his car off a back road, out in the country (one critic humorously asserted that the film should have been called ""Hot dogs and Hand Jobs"", alluding to the aforementioned scene as well the scene at the end of the film, when King George finally owns up to liking the hot dogs that have been served to him during a picnic with the press in attendance).Despite his polio, it's apparent that FDR had enough sexual sensation left that led him to indulge in various affairs with women. It was also a matter of companionship, given the pressure of the job he held. Nonetheless, the fact that FDR did have affairs is not all that interesting in the grand scheme of things. The big second act crisis is when Daisy finds out about FDR's other relationship with Marguerite LeHand. There's a blow-up but Daisy does eventually 'come around', and accepts the fact that the President must 'have' his women. Again, not very interesting stuff.'Hyde Park on Hudson' is a breezy but narrow in scope peek at the FDR's personal life during one short moment in time.

We see him drinking and carrying on with his distant cousin. We see him as a man who could put anyone at ease...the consummate politician. And most importantly, we see him in a wheelchair and also physically carried from place to place within his house like a baby. We get a very good understanding of the reality of his life.Somehow, for all the years of his political life, the public was unaware of this important fact. This is at once shocking and uplifting. Obviously, he was a man of incredible physical and mental strength who could command a great nation even as he suffered with his affliction. Thus, the movie highlights his strengths and his weaknesses, physically and morally. This is a welcome change in the historical depiction of the popular four-time president.Bill Murray provides a very low-key FDR, kind of an ""At Home with FDR"" approach. Only when the photographers are present does Murray's FDR pop into the newsreel character we know and love. Murray creates a pleasant characterization which rings true. The story is simple. The pace is slow. But the ""a fly on the wall"" viewpoint for the movie audience is most intriguing and satisfying.If you're looking for action, this is not the movie, but if you want a thoughtful look behind the curtain at the man who ran the United States from 1932 to 1945, try HYDE PARK ON THE HUDSON.",4,The Man Behind the Curtain,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,1440,"['FDR', 'Saint', 'sinner', 'movie', 'President', 'Roosevelt', 'stripped', 'media', 'facade', 'see', 'drinking', 'carrying', 'distant', 'cousin', 'see', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'put', 'anyone', 'ease', 'consummate', 'politician', 'most', 'importantly', 'see', 'wheelchair', 'also', 'physically', 'carried', 'place', 'place', 'house', 'baby', 'get', 'very', 'good', 'understanding', 'reality', 'life.Somehow', 'years', 'political', 'life', 'public', 'was', 'unaware', 'important', 'fact', 'once', 'shocking', 'uplifting', 'Obviously', 'was', 'man', 'incredible', 'physical', 'mental', 'strength', 'who', 'could', 'command', 'great', 'nation', 'even', 'suffered', 'affliction', 'Thus', 'movie', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'physically', 'morally', 'welcome', 'change', 'historical', 'depiction', 'popular', 'four-time', 'president.Bill', 'Murray', 'very', 'low-key', 'FDR', 'kind', 'Home', 'FDR', 'approach', 'Only', 'when', 'photographers', 'are', 'present', 'Murray', 'FDR', 'pop', 'newsreel', 'character', 'know', 'love', 'Murray', 'pleasant', 'characterization', 'true', 'story', 'simple', 'pace', 'slow', 'fly', 'wall', 'viewpoint', 'movie', 'audience', 'most', 'intriguing', 'satisfying.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'action', 'not', 'movie', 'want', 'thoughtful', 'look', 'curtain', 'man', 'who', 'ran', 'United', 'States', '1932', '1945', 'try', 'HYDE', 'PARK', 'ON', 'THE', 'HUDSON']",N/A
1621847,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00B4ZN3XQ,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[31, 42]","Hyde Park On Hudson is something of a problematic film, an uneven mix of some excellent performances and cinematography dragged down by a schizoid screenplay that can't seem to make up its mind which of two stories it's trying to tell: Margaret ""Daisy"" Suckley's long-term relationship with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt as his mistress (or one of them, anyway), or the historic visit of King George VI to meet with FDR on the eve of WWII, the first time a reigning British monarch had ever visited the US. Either would've made an interesting story, but in Hyde Park On Hudson, they end up working at cross purposes, leaving the whole disappointingly less than of the sum of its parts.The film begins in the early 1930's when Daisy (Laura Linney) is unexpectedly summoned by FDR's formidable mother, Sara (Elizabeth Wilson) to their home, Springwood, in Hyde Park, New York, to be a personal assistant to Franklin (Bill Murray in a truly remarkable performance). Daisy, a spinster in her early 40's who lives with her aunt and a distant (sixth cousin) relative of FDR's goes, though she has no idea of why Franklin would ask for her as she hasn't seen him in years or what her duties would involve. She soon finds out however as Franklin first charms and then later seduces her into becoming his mistress.Things then fast-forward to June of 1939, when the King and Queen of the United Kingdom, George VI (Samuel West) and his wife Elizabeth (Olivia Colman), are making their historic visit to the US. Franklin has invited the royal couple to spend the weekend with him at Springwood and the house is a flurry of activity making preparations. The visit has critical importance for both men. ""Bertie"", as George VI was known to his intimates, is extremely nervous, having been charged with the mission of persuading FDR to get the US on Britain's side in the conflict that everyone knew was coming. FDR's own objective in the well-publicized visit was to counter the isolationist faction in the country, using the young King and Queen to charm the American public and remind them of our historic ties to the British people and the need to stand together against the rising Nazi threat in Europe. Part of his plan though was to show the royals as being ""just like us"", which involved an open-air picnic at which hot dogs - among other things - would be served, a prospect which, when they heard about it, left the King baffled and the Queen appalled, both privately wondering if they were being mocked:Bertie: ""At the picnic, the president's wife has organized hot dogs be served as our main dish.""Elizabeth: ""Are they trying to make fun of us?""Bertie: ""I... I don't know.""To its credit, Hyde Park On Hudson is blessed with a number of excellent performances, the foremost of which is Bill Murray's thoroughly engaging portrayal of FDR. Murray's Franklin is a multi-faceted delivery that brings to life both the natural charm and empathy that enabled FDR to win over individuals in intimate settings as well as crowds and the nation as a whole, and the man's vulnerabilities, from the polio which he constantly strove to overcome and at the same time keep out of the public eye, to the chaos of his personal life stemming from clashes with - and between - his strong-willed mother and wife and from having more than one mistress at the same time. Elizabeth Wilson's Sara Roosevelt is a domineering matriarch with a strong sense of the proper way of things, determined to have her own way in her own house, regardless of Franklin being the President. Olivia Williams' Eleanor Roosevelt is strong, independent and pragmatic, carving out her own role and life as First Lady. For her, Franklin's infidelities have long since become a problem to be quietly managed rather than anything to get worked up over. Elizabeth Marvel's Marguerite ""Missy"" LeHand has a subtle task as FDR's private secretary whose job included knowing every detail of FDR's personal life and not revealing what she knew. Which it turns out is more than we suspect. Samuel West's Bertie is a fine portrayal of a man who never expected to be king, never in fact wanted to be king because of his shyness and embarrassing stammer, but whose sense of duty compelled him to step up to the plate and be one when his older brother Edward unexpectedly abdicated and fate then thrust it upon him. Olivia Colman's Elizabeth is the more out-going of the pair, but highly conscious of and protective towards her husband's dignity and position, and Colman brings this out convincingly, making Bertie and Elizabeth a husband and wife as well as King and Queen.And as I mentioned, Lol Crawley's cinematography is lush and detailed, capturing the intimate details from how the individual rooms at Springwood were furnished to unique features like FDR's specially designed car that allowed him to drive himself around in spite of not being able to use his legs. His visuals bring to life a different era, giving that extra little touch of realism for the actors to use to their advantage, giving us a revealing glimpse into FDR's private world.But that said, Hyde Park On Hudson does have its problems, most of which seem to stem from the script. As director, Roger Michell, who has notable films like Notting Hill, Changing Lanes and Venus among his credits, handles the individual scenes quite capably, but he cannot overcome the structural and character problems of Richard Nelson's screenplay. This may be due to Nelson's having very little experience writing for film, most of his work having been for the stage. Apparently Nelson originally did Hyde Park On Hudson as a radio play for the BBC in 2009, but what the differences were between that play and the eventual screenplay used for the film, I do not know. It is hard, however, to imagine the screenplay working any better in radio, if not being actually worse.One of the key problems is that, plot-wise, the two stories don't really mesh with each other. The film starts as Daisy's story, told from her point of view as is emphasized by her opening voice-over narrative. However when things shift over to the King and Queen's visit, the structure quickly breaks down. For one thing, Daisy's involvement in the actual royal visit was virtually non-existent, making her role as the point-of-view character telling the story at once problematic. Particularly with regard to the private scenes between Bertie and Elizabeth, and between Bertie and Franklin, where she was obviously not present. As a result, the film has problem maintaining both rhythm and momentum. Just as one story gets going for a bit, it's interrupted and the film has to shift gears to deal with the other.Another problem is that one story is simply so much better than the other. The scenes centered around FDR and the King and Queen are definitely the best parts of the film things actually flow when dealing with that story line. It also seems to bring out the best in all of the actors, both in terms of their performances and in the chemistry that evolves among them. These are the scenes in which Murray shines, bringing forth FDR's wit and enormous personal charm, showing us how and why FDR was the man he was. Particularly in the scenes where Franklin and Bertie are alone together and out of the public eye and he puts the anxious young king at ease, showing how much they have in common.The story about FDR and Daisy is, well, awkward on so many levels you wish that they'd left it all on the cutting room floor. One problem is that the scenes dealing with their relationship just feel wrong. The `seduction' scene in particular. It's handled so awkwardly that you don't know whether to squirm or giggle, even though it's clearly not meant to be funny. And yet another big problem is a complete lack of chemistry between Linney's Daisy and Murray's FDR. You never really buy into the idea that these two had any kind of relationship, no matter what you're seeing on the screen. And in a broader sense, Daisy always seems out of place in every scene, which only adds to the awkwardness. I have to blame the script (again) for this as Linney is a fine actress as she has shown in films like You Can Count On Me, Kinsey and The Savages, all of which earned her Academy Award nominations, and other performances for which she has won both Emmy and Golden Globe awards. But sometimes even the best actors cannot overcome a weak script, and this I feel is one of those times.Oddly enough, the film doesn't even mention Suckley's biggest contribution to FDR's public persona. One of Suckley's hobbies was raising Scottish Terriers, and it was she who gave him his dog Fala, who soon became ""the most photographed dog in the world"" as he was almost constantly with FDR wherever he went, including at many of his press conferences.Recommended for Bill Murray's extraordinary performance and for the half that deals with the King and Queen's visit.Comment Comment |

It made these idolized leaders more human without detracting from their legend. Well cast, maybe Bill Murray's best work to-date. This movie should be recognized if not win awards.

Murray does a fantastic job of playing a very practical FDR.  Linney does a great job playing his mistress, only to find out... shockingly, that she's not the only one.  It rather gives credence to the idea that everyone is up to something, at least they are in this movie.
