Yes I like the Walking Dead too, can't wait till the season starts back up again. But this movie is in a whole different class.  And if it was indeed a low budget movie, then good for them. I thought the acting was excellent, special effects were up to par with any of the current movies if not better.  Warning, it is very gory.And yes, I found lots of flaws with the film such as shooting your automatic weapons at zombies while your mates stood right behind the zombies they were shooting at. Sorry, but I was laughing too hard to hold it against them.This movie is a comedy and a well done one if you ask me.  If you like serious, sad and weepy eyed zombie movies, then this is not for you. If you want a lot of character development and want to feel empathy with the characters, then this movie is not for you.

Granted that both movies take place in London and have zombies skulking about but these are two completely different movies.  Besides compared to the disaster of a movie called World War Z, this movie was way more entertaining!!Cockneys vs. Zombies is a hilarious take of what might happen if zombies decide to invade the East End of London.  The reactions from the inhabitants of the East End are both matter of fact and gut wrenchingly funny.  There were certain parts of the movie which had me laughing even after the movie was over.  IMHO, this movie is a great way to get your mind off things for about 90 minutes.One final point, this movie also has the stunningly beautiful Michelle Ryan (who was previously the Bionic Woman).

1570045,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B008LU8MVK,Joseph M. Reninger,"[3, 8]","Cockneys vs. Zombies is a great title, right? It evokes this vague image of funny-accented (at least to American ears) salt-of-the-earth tough guys taking on unspeaking and unspeakable horrors fresh out of the earth. This movie delivers, but not a whole truckload of fun like you'd imagine.The story follows two brothers, Terry and Andy, as they get ready to rob a bank. Money isn't their motivation. No, they want to save their granddad's old age home from evil developers who want to put up condos. They put together a band of misfits to do the job but things get cocked up when the zombie apocalypse starts in the middle of their standoff with the police outside the bank.Meanwhile, we follow the story of the granddad, who is a war vet. He lives in an old-age home with a few (surprisingly few, actually) characters who could have been more colorful. They become his band of brothers when the zombies show up. The humor on this side of the story is better. One guy is sleeping in the back garden when the zombies come. They ignore him. The people inside realize he's still out there. They wake him by shouting which also draws the zombies' attention. He grabs his walker and has the slowest chase scene as the zombies stagger after him, almost within reach.The set up is interesting but the rest of the movie doesn't pay off in a satisfying way, as either a horror film or a comedy.

While a British movie, it has no connection with Shaun of the Dead other than the British accents (so comparisons to that movie are off base and misleading).Spoilers / PlotTwo young, slacker-type men are planning a bank heist.  Their &#34;crew&#34; consists of their attractive female cousin, a deranged war vet  (with a metal plate in his head), and a buddy that qualifies among the worlds least dangerous criminals (captured when he started to flirt with the clerk he was robbing, who promptly grabbed his weapon and ko'd him).As these are the &#34;heroes&#34;, there is a rather minimal yet awkward subplot about vague corporate corruption so the money they end up taking is from the obligatory evil corporation -- gotta keep folks liking the characters, dontcha know.  Of course, they are doing this to &#34;save&#34; their grandfather's retirement home from being razed by aforementioned evil corporation.The zombies are released from an old crypt that is uncovered at a construction site nearby.  Not a lot of depth to this idea, just zombies that have been interred yet waiting to burst out in the modern day.  The zombies are your typical Romero shambler type - slow moving and bites are fatal and cause one to become a zombie.The action of the story is the two brothers, their crew (and hostages) reacting to the ZA and then deciding to go and try and rescue grandpa.  Gramps, a cantankerous and fit WWII vet, is a delight in the film.  The retirement home is the scene of the worlds slowest chase scene (done well) of a poorly shambling zombie chasing a pensioner in a walker (don't worry, the old man survives)Overall, I did enjoy the show.  I like how some of the characters history and outlook is explained via brief flashback -- frankly some of the best scenes in the movie.  Decent to above average zombie effects with some nice attention to detail help a lot.  The plot is not deep by any means, so no tortured examination of the human soul during the ZA here.

I wont spoil the humor by laying down the best scenes , but I will say that it does have a horrible scene that is funny in spite of itself , as a man throws a zombie infant at a billboard sign , that warns people about being safe!.  Things like that and the whole film are slanted towards humor , which unlike lets say 'a little bit zombie' don't go into parody territory , instead it's just part of the flicks demented structure. This is a first class zombie flick on all levels. It's a higher budget flick , done in England and it's worth your money.  the hd transfer is excellent, but in some scenes you really have to listen as the cockney accent is very present here!.

We open the film with a group of young bank robbers who are modern day Robin Hoods. Well to a point. One of them is a hardcore gang member and the rest are just trying to get the funds to make an anonymous donation to the leader&#8217;s father&#8217;s old folks home. The place is going out of business and they want to find a way to keep it open and this seems to be it.Things &#8216;mostly&#8217; go well until in the middle of it we see that a zombie outbreak is going on from a nearby burial ground that had been opened up. Oh yea, zombie curse that brings forth the undead.While they are on the run from the cops they also have a few hostages, one of them which is getting friendly with the robbers while another can&#8217;t keep his mouth shut long enough to stay alive. He somehow does though, for much more of the film than he had any right to.Still we see quite a bit of the robbers vs the undead as well as those who are surviving in the old folks home fighting zombies.

Cockneys refers to the nickname of those working class Brits who live in London&#8217;s East End.  Two construction workers uncover a tomb sealed in the 17th century and unwittingly unleash its blood-thirsty inhabitants on the city.  Meanwhile brothers Terry and Andy have planned a bank robbery with several of their friends in order to save their grandfather&#8217;s retirement home from being torn down.  The robbery attempt goes awry and the group soon finds themselves inside the back surrounded by cops.  As they plan their next move they look out to see all of the cops dead.  Making their getaway, they soon find the city crawling with zombies.As the group of would be bank robbers seeks refuge from the undead in an abandoned warehouse, the boys grandfather Ray and several other elderly residents of the retirement home are trapped in the kitchen by the zombies.  Among those are Peggy, played by Honor Blackman best known as Bond Girl Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, and longtime British TV star Richard Briers as Hamish, who passed away earlier this year.While not on the same level of Shaun of the Dead in terms of gut-busting laughs, Cockneys Vs. Zombies has some standout comedic moments, most of them involving the senior citizens.  One scene finds Hamish, who requires a walker, trying to &#8220;out run&#8221; the shambling zombies.  In fact the film has two distinct tones.  While the retirement home is lighter and filled with laughs, the bank robber&#8217;s parts are played more for straight horror.  When the brothers hijack a double-decker bus in order to save their grandfather, the two distinct stories mix together for a nice blend of horror and humor.  Alan Ford is a cast standout as the boys&#8217; tough, former gangster grandfather.Overall a good deal of fun and the blu-ray comes with two audio commentaries, and some behind-the-scenes featurettes.",3,Not Shaun of the Dead but OK,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1981,"['tradition', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'British', 'zombie', 'horror/comedy', 'Cockneys', 'Vs.', 'Zombies', 'Cockneys', 'refers', 'nickname', 'working', 'class', 'Brits', 'who', 'live', 'London', '8217', 'East', 'End', 'Two', 'construction', 'workers', 'uncover', 'tomb', 'sealed', '17th', 'century', 'unwittingly', 'unleash', 'blood-thirsty', 'inhabitants', 'city', 'Meanwhile', 'brothers', 'Terry', 'Andy', 'have', 'planned', 'bank', 'robbery', 'several', 'friends', 'order', 'save', 'grandfather', '8217', 'retirement', 'home', 'being', 'torn', 'down', 'robbery', 'attempt', 'awry', 'group', 'soon', 'back', 'surrounded', 'cops', 'plan', 'next', 'move', 'look', 'out', 'see', 'cops', 'dead', 'Making', 'getaway', 'soon', 'find', 'city', 'crawling', 'group', 'would', 'be', 'bank', 'robbers', 'seeks', 'refuge', 'undead', 'abandoned', 'warehouse', 'boys', 'Ray', 'several', 'other', 'elderly', 'residents', 'retirement', 'home', 'are', 'trapped', 'kitchen', 'zombies', 'are', 'Peggy', 'played', 'Honor', 'Blackman', 'best', 'known', 'Bond', 'Girl', 'Pussy', 'Galore', 'Goldfinger', 'longtime', 'British', 'TV', 'star', 'Richard', 'Briers', 'Hamish', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'earlier', 'year.While', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'terms', 'gut-busting', 'laughs', 'Cockneys', 'Vs.', 'Zombies', 'standout', 'comedic', 'moments', 'most', 'involving', 'senior', 'citizens', 'One', 'scene', 'Hamish', 'who', 'walker', 'trying', '8220', 'run', '8221', 'shambling', 'zombies', 'fact', 'film', 'two', 'distinct', 'tones', 'retirement', 'home', 'lighter', 'filled', 'laughs', 'bank', 'robber', '8217', 'parts', 'are', 'played', 'more', 'straight', 'horror', 'When', 'brothers', 'hijack', 'double-decker', 'bus', 'order', 'save', 'grandfather', 'two', 'distinct', 'stories', 'mix', 'together', 'nice', 'blend', 'horror', 'humor', 'Alan', 'Ford', 'cast', 'standout', 'boys', '8217', 'tough', 'former', 'gangster', 'grandfather.Overall', 'good', 'deal', 'fun', 'blu-ray', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes']",N/A

In ""Cockneys vs Zombies"" the story jumps back and forth between two groups for the considerable amount of time. Also, some of the slapstick jokes (""Look behind you!"") are repetitious and unfunny; even some characters like trigger-happy Mickey is just annoying.""Cockneys vs Zombies"" is yet another zombie-related comedy that could have been more entertaining with better jokes and more gores. There are a few nice gags and Alan Ford and Honor Blackman brandishing guns steal every scene they are in, but their characters (especially Blackman's), as well as Michelle Ryan (of ""Eastenders""), are underused.
