Of course, that doesn't mean I'm not bored by the several, monotonous storylines of ""boy-gets-girl"". Of course, there are always a few exceptions that stand out from the typical trend. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is a shining example. Karan Johar's direction is truly amazing, and the acting is unbeatable. If Johar had cast anybody else to play any of the characters in this film, I doubt it would have been the same. That doesn't mean the film relies heavily on acting. The plot and direction individually are enough to carry the film through. The cinematography is first-rate, and each camera angle seems to have a special, radiant beauty. Overall, a noble endeavor that has resulted in an awesome film.

764805,A1FALNRP7TPE3V,B0000AMAFR,A. Lucy,"[1, 1]","I enjoyed watching this film, and I have to say I was impressed by the pretty packaging. Ususally one-disc releases of movies don't have very fancy boxes. This one was nice and had a slip-cover. The movie itself was just as I remembered it from when I saw it years ago more or less.The quality of the picture on the dvd while playing didn't impress me much, though. It almost looked like VHS at some parts, and more often than not it made me feel like I was watching a movie projected at a theater rather than a movie properly compressed and adapted for dvd. There were little black lines upon occasion, nothing truly distracting, but if you're expecting a really HQ copy of the film, this may not be the dvd for you. If you just want to see the film again because you liked it a long time ago and kind of missed it (as I did) then it's probably right up your alley. It's watchable, and it has english subtitles, although I have to say I've edited fanfiction with less typos in it than those subtitles had at times. All the same, it was an over-all enjoyable experince, and I'm pleased enough to have my copy. No real problems.The movie itself is a good story. It's about an Indian family that is torn apart when the oldest son (who is actually adopted) marries a woman from a lower class after promising his father he would wed the woman he picked out for him. The son is disowned, and hurt at 'being made a stranger again' leaves the family for ten years thinking that his father can no longer love him. His younger brother, now grown up and college-aged, wishes to bring the family back together. He eventually does so, and there is a romance between him and his sister-in-law's little sister, Pooja, who was a sort of friend/bully of his as a child. Over-all, it's very cute, and well worth watching at least once. A nice film to have around when you have some spare time. Save it for day when you have a few hours on hand, or else watch it bit by bit, though, because it is pretty long.",3,Good Enough,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,1991,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'impressed', 'pretty', 'packaging', 'Ususally', 'one-disc', 'releases', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'fancy', 'boxes', 'one', 'was', 'nice', 'had', 'slip-cover', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'remembered', 'when', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'more', 'less.The', 'quality', 'picture', 'dvd', 'playing', 'did', ""n't"", 'impress', 'much', 'though', 'almost', 'looked', 'VHS', 'parts', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'projected', 'theater', 'rather', 'movie', 'properly', 'compressed', 'adapted', 'dvd', 'were', 'little', 'black', 'lines', 'occasion', 'nothing', 'truly', 'distracting', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'really', 'HQ', 'copy', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'dvd', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'liked', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'kind', 'missed', 'did', 'then', 'probably', 'right', 'up', 'alley', 'watchable', 'english', 'subtitles', 'have', 'say', ""'ve"", 'edited', 'fanfiction', 'less', 'typos', 'subtitles', 'had', 'times', 'same', 'was', 'over-all', 'enjoyable', 'experince', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'enough', 'have', 'copy', 'real', 'problems.The', 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'Indian', 'family', 'torn', 'apart', 'when', 'oldest', 'son', 'who', 'actually', 'adopted', 'woman', 'lower', 'class', 'promising', 'father', 'would', 'wed', 'woman', 'picked', 'out', 'son', 'disowned', 'hurt', ""'being"", 'made', 'stranger', 'again', 'family', 'ten', 'years', 'thinking', 'father', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'love', 'younger', 'brother', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'college-aged', 'wishes', 'bring', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'eventually', 'so', 'romance', 'sister-in-law', 'little', 'sister', 'Pooja', 'who', 'was', 'sort', 'friend/bully', 'child', 'Over-all', 'very', 'cute', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'nice', 'film', 'have', 'around', 'when', 'have', 'spare', 'time', 'Save', 'day', 'when', 'have', 'few', 'hours', 'hand', 'else', 'watch', 'bit', 'bit', 'though', 'pretty', 'long']",N/A

Brokenhearted, Rahul not only leaves the family estate, but leaves India altogether taking up residence in London, England.Ten years later his younger brother Rohan (Hrithik Roshan) goes in search of Rahul in hopes of mending the breach between father and son and restore family unity. Rohan was only a small boy when Rahul left, so when they meet again in London Rahul has no idea who he is.

This movie has a great cast, wonderful songs and a good storyline.  The acting across the board is great with Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh Bachan being the stand out stellar performances.  The character development is excellent, you can completely identify with the characters.  The chemistry between Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol is believable and touching.  Kareena Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan's pair is funny and nice also.The first half of the movie is flashback. The first half of the movie is pretty good overall with a little lull in between.  There are some emotional scenes and some funny ones. The second half is perfect. It will make you alternate between laughing out loud or crying in some scenes.The only criticisms I have with this movie is Johnny Lever is annoying in the first half (he doesn't come in the second half thank goodness) and Kajol overacts at being Punjabi in the first half a little. This movie is like a breath of fresh air after watching ""Family Stone"" and other American movies where people have sex and/or great drunk or alternately ""fall in love"" after one meeting and there is no character development or a sense of love on a mental or emotional level.  In Bollywood and in Hollywood directors seem to think less character development or the less wholesome a story the better.

You don't get to see the legendary Amitabh Bachan,SRK and Hrithik Roshan in one film. The story thought quite filmy is different from the ones I've watched. It has its own inertia. There are many scenes in this film that made me go numb. I saw this film in my early-late teens and I must say it came as a jolt to me.It's a family based drama. Easily the best Bollywood has ever put out. Karan Johar wins all respect for the kind of emotion he seeks to and manges to bring out in not just the characters but the audience too. I never heard anyone talk ill of this film simply cause its flawless. Now Now Now...if I had to describe the film to someone I'd say its about a father , a step son and a son. One very underlined motive behind this film is family values.I've seen previous films like Hum Aapke Hai Kaun and Maine Pyaar Kiya and a few others. With all due respect, I thought they were corny,overbloated and pointless. They tried to appeal to the mass audience and did but they never really struck any emotional chord with me. K3G has simple scenes that are so brilliantly directed that they actually brought a tear or ten to my eyes. I felt there was something wrong with me. Maybe it's the absolutely subtle niceness I noticed in a few characters.Hrithik never acted as good as he did in this film. There's this nice boyish non rebellious energy in him that leaves me confused.Jaya Bachchan was surprisingly good in the film. I have never liked her acting. Kareena Kapoor is good for her role.Kajol , who I for some reason held some contempt again delivers a great performance as a wife stuck between inlaws and her hubby. The introductions to the characters of Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik were just outstanding.A very well thought out film.

764819,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0000AMAFR,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[39, 43]","KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM (Sometimes Happiness, Sometimes Sorrow) boasts as sparkling a dream cast as Bollywood can ever hope of putting together. Director Karan Johar reunites with his three stars fromKuch Kuch Hota Hai(Shahrukh Khan, Kajol, Rani Mukerji) and then, for extra flavor, tacks on Amitabh Bachchan, his wife Jaya Bachchan, Hrithik Roshan, and Kareena Kapoor. In India, brother, that translates to some megahuge star power. That cast alone is enough to guarantee a killing in the box office (which is in fact what happened). And, as predictable as the sun rising in the east, Kajol and Shahrukh Khan's chemistry retains its potency.When you tune in to a Bollywood flick, brace yourself for tears and laughter, get ready to drown in vivid colors and over-the-top musical numbers. Chances are, you may even scoff at the sheer overwroughtness of the story. KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM, coming out in 2001, offers the quintessential Bollywood experience. There's nothing so new about this story, which revolves around a younger son's vow to return his long vanished brother back to the fold, after a decade of estrangement. The film follows the expected beats and clobbers you over the head with maudlin family histrionics. What makes it work are the terrific performances of the actors.Caste and breeding matter to Yashvardhan ""Yash"" Raichand (Amitabh Bachchan), the proud, unbending patriarch of the powerful Raichand family. So the whatsis hits the fan when Yash's marriage plans for his adopted son Rahul go awry, because Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) has already fallen in love with Anjali (Kajol), the daughter of a lowly sweetmeat shop owner. That Anjali is vivacious and captivating means diddly squat to Yash, who just can't get past the notion that her station in life falls so far beneath expectations. When Anjali's father dies unexpectedly, leaving her and her younger sister Pooja orphaned and alone, Rahul decides to marry Anjali on the spot. This, as expected, enrages Yash all to bits. He and Rahul exchange words, the result of which is that Rahul is disowned. He bitterly departs, never to return. Ten years pass.Even though Hrithik Roshan is featured in the framing segments of the film's first half (which is mostly a long flashback to what happened ten years ago), his presence is really felt in the second half. It's pretty funny, to look at this good-looking, all-muscly dude, that the character he plays, during childhood, used to be called Fatty. Fatty's real name is Rohan, Rahul's obese younger brother. Present day finds Rohan the best player in his cricket team, and I'm guessing he's implemented a good, good diet. Rohan, having been so young when Rahul left, has never gotten a full recounting of the rift between his brother and his father. When, on visiting his grandmothers, he finally learns the truth, he promises to find and bring Rahul and Anjali home to reconcile them with their father. His search leads him to London.Not for one nanosecond do I think that KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM improves in any way on KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI, which is one of my favorite Bollywood films ever. But KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM has got its moments. First of all, the lush cinematography dazzles the bejeesus out of you, offering many stunning images and striking compositions and instantly assuring the audience that everyone involved in making this film spared no expenses and effort. There are ten songs here, some of which are impressively lavish productions, with ""You Are My Soniya"" and ""Bole Chudiyan"" showcasing Hrithik's dancing mojo. And, of course, there's that sweeping and evocative theme song. Although, I do vaguely resent that in ""Suraj Hua Maddham"" (the number set in Egypt) one could hear the strains of the theme song from KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI (Is it a rip-off or an homage?). Note too that the names of the lovers in both KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI and KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM are Rahul and Anjali (and that, in these two movies, they're played by Shahrukh and Kajol). Coincidence?The film's second half mostly takes place in London and focuses much on Hrithik Roshan as he begins his subterfuge and ingratiates himself to an unwitting Rahul and Anjali, having passed himself off as the brother of Pooja's friend (Pooja, remember, is Anjali's younger sister, with whom Rohan has come clean and asked for help). Pooja is played by Kareena Kapoor, so it's no wonder that she's grown up smoking hot. Kareena does her shallow, perky bit, and it's a bit annoying, but this film's not really about her. Hrithik, on the other hand, is very good, especially when called on to produce unshed tears, an acting conceit which Shahrukh had long ago perfected.I don't think I'll go into how very good each actor here is (okay, Kareena Kapoor doesn't totally suck). As usual, what was initially meant to be some quick comments have diarrhead into this lengthy thing. I'll say this: the actors do earn their paychecks and all that good adulation, and Kajol remains the most incandescent star in Bollywood (sorry, Aishwarya Rai). And, here, Kajol is also very funny. KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM has flaws which critics can gleefully pick at, it's true. It's certainly hammy enough. But one of the best things I admire in Bollywood is that its films aren't afraid to show unabashed emotion. No romance is so romantic, no heartache so torturous as when expressed in Bollywood. This film features two love stories, that of Rahul and Anjali and that of Rohan and Pooja (which really isn't as well developed). But, at its heart, this film means to demonstrate the significance of family, of one's roots and ties, at least in Hindi culture. Or as Director Karan Johar's introductory quote goes: ""It's all about loving your parents."" While I enjoyed Rahul and Anjali's interactions, I found it almost as absorbing that Anjali so desperately longs for the blessings of her father-in-law. I do wish that Kajol and Amitabh Bachchan had more scenes together. As far as the scenes between Amitabh and Shahrukh, brother, they are intense, intense stuff.Speaking of Hindi culture, there's one neat scene in which Kajol's character, exiled to England and often prone to nationalistic moods, is gratified to hear her young son singing the Indian national anthem at a school function. Just one of the standout moments in this film, which, by the way, is three and a half hours long. So you're gonna need a whole mess of hankies.",5,"Bridging a family chasm thru dance and song, guilt and subterfuge",1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,6414,"['KABHI', 'KHUSHI', 'KABHIE', 'GHAM',

764820,A1YMZC2G7XCB9L,B0000AMAFR,H. Gardner,"[1, 1]","K3G was the first Bollywood film I saw, and my viewing it resulted in my thorough addiction to the genre.  I spent almost four hours watching this family drama, the singing and dancing, and all the beautiful actors and actresses and was completely mesmerized by the sheer pageantry of the film.  The so-so story is essentially two different love stories, set against the backdrop of intense family pressures and cultural issues unique to life as an NRI (non-resident Indian).  As with all Karan Johar movies, there is plenty of crying and melodrama, but a happy ending.  K3G is an Indian blockbuster that stars six of the biggest film stars in the Bollywood industry and features unusual, exquisite scenery and expensive, lavish costumes.  The songs, in particular, are gorgeous eye candy.My main complaint about this film arises from several years of watching Hindi cinema, in that the melodrama and pat dialogues of this movie become less moving and more annoying over time.  However, I still recommend this movie as a nice, entertaining film and a fine overall introduction into the spectacle of Bollywood movies.  While it's not one of the best for either acting or story (despite winning several awards in the year of its release), K3G is still a solid Karan Johar production that is easy to watch and likely to lead to a Bollywood addiction.",4,"Beautiful, but highly melodramatic",1215648000,"07 10, 2008",2008,1347,"['K3G', 'was', 'first', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'saw', 'viewing', 'resulted', 'thorough', 'addiction', 'genre', 'spent', 'almost', 'four', 'hours', 'watching', 'family', 'drama', 'singing', 'dancing', 'beautiful', 'actors', 'actresses', 'was', 'completely', 'mesmerized', 'sheer', 'pageantry', 'film', 'so-so', 'story', 'essentially', 'two', 'different', 'love', 'stories', 'set', 'backdrop', 'intense', 'family', 'pressures', 'cultural', 'issues', 'unique', 'life', 'NRI', 'non-resident', 'Indian', 'Karan', 'Johar', 'movies', 'plenty', 'crying', 'melodrama', 'happy', 'ending', 'K3G', 'Indian', 'blockbuster', 'six', 'biggest', 'film', 'stars', 'Bollywood', 'industry', 'features', 'unusual', 'exquisite', 'scenery', 'expensive', 'lavish', 'costumes', 'songs', 'particular', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'eye', 'candy.My', 'main', 'complaint', 'film', 'several', 'years', 'watching', 'Hindi', 'cinema', 'melodrama', 'pat', 'dialogues', 'movie', 'become', 'less', 'moving', 'more', 'annoying', 'time', 'However', 'still', 'recommend', 'movie', 'nice', 'entertaining', 'film', 'fine', 'overall', 'introduction', 'spectacle', 'Bollywood', 'movies', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'acting', 'story', 'winning', 'several', 'awards', 'year', 'release', 'K3G', 'still', 'solid', 'Karan', 'Johar', 'production', 'easy', 'watch', 'likely', 'lead', 'Bollywood', 'addiction']",N/A
764821,A2UJG6T6DOWKQF,B0000AMAFR,Jennifer Hopfinger,"[2, 2]","The title, which means ""Sometimes Laughter, Sometimes Tears,"" pretty much sums up Hindi cinema, and the film is inclusive in another way: it embraces the transition in style and content that was well underway in Bollywood when it was released while remaining rooted in India's time-honored film conventions and cultural values.The family unit is held in sacred regard, and the bonds of love between parents and children are often stronger than any other--except when romantic love dares to take precedence, which is what happens to the Raichands, a spectacularly rich family in Delhi. Yash (Amitabh Bachchan) and his wife Nandini (played by Amitabh's real wife Jaya Bachchan) are the zillionaire parents of Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) and Rohan (played as an adult later in the film by Hrithik Roshan), who was unexpectedly born to them nine years after adopting Rahul. In the beginning, the family is full of worshipful love for each other, exemplified in the first musical number, the title track, in which they pray to the gods and bless one other while singing and dancing goes on around them.The wealthy are a trademark subject of the director, Karan Johar, and he consciously winks at the audience with the film's ridiculous display of affluence. The Raichand's home looks like the manor house of an English lord on the outside (even though it's in India) and an Indian palace on the inside. For transportation, they use their own personal helicopters, which drop them off on the front lawn of the grand estate.Yash wants Rahul to marry Naina (Rani Mukerji), a family friend, who has all the class and breeding required to fit into the Raichand household. But Rahul loves Anjali (Kajol), his nanny's niece, a brash and boisterous lower-class girl who runs a sweet shop in the chaotic, colorful Delhi neighborhood of Chandni Chowk. Opposites attract, after all, and when Anjali's father dies, leaving her and her much younger sister Pooja (played as an adult by Kareena Kapoor) with no one to care for them, Rahul defies his father and marries Anjali. The stern authoritarian patriarch promptly disowns his favorite son for what he considers to be an unforgivable betrayal. Rahul and his new wife and sister-in-law move to London. When Rohan grows up, he sets out to reconcile the two enormous egos that split up his happy family.The superb melodrama is as thick as honey and as darkly sweet, but the film is a whopping three-and-a-half hours long and the interminable musical numbers (there are 10) may test the endurance of all but die-hard Bollywood fans.- The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",3,Worth Watching,1258416000,"11 17, 2009",2009,2649,"['title', 'Sometimes', 'Laughter', 'Sometimes', 'Tears', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'Hindi', 'cinema', 'film', 'inclusive', 'way', 'transition', 'style', 'content', 'was', 'well', 'underway', 'Bollywood', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'remaining', 'rooted', 'India', 'time-honored', 'film', 'conventions', 'cultural', 'values.The', 'family', 'unit', 'held', 'sacred', 'regard', 'bonds', 'love', 'parents', 'children', 'are', 'often', 'stronger', 'other', 'when', 'romantic', 'love', 'take', 'precedence', 'what', 'Raichands', 'spectacularly', 'rich', 'family', 'Delhi', 'Yash', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'wife', 'Nandini', 'played', 'Amitabh', 'real', 'wife', 'Jaya', 'Bachchan', 'are', 'zillionaire', 'parents', 'Rahul', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'Rohan', 'played', 'adult', 'later', 'film', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'who', 'was', 'unexpectedly', 'born', 'nine', 'years', 'adopting', 'Rahul', 'beginning', 'family', 'full', 'worshipful', 'love', 'other', 'exemplified', 'first', 'musical', 'number', 'title', 'track', 'pray', 'gods', 'bless', 'one', 'other', 'singing', 'dancing', 'them.The', 'wealthy', 'are', 'trademark', 'subject', 'director', 'Karan', 'Johar', 'consciously', 'audience', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'display', 'affluence', 'Raichand', 'home', 'manor', 'house', 'English', 'lord', 'outside', 'even', 'India', 'Indian', 'palace', 'inside', 'transportation', 'use', 'own', 'personal', 'helicopters', 'off', 'front', 'lawn', 'grand', 'estate.Yash', 'Rahul', 'marry', 'Naina', 'Rani', 'Mukerji', 'family', 'friend', 'who', 'class', 'breeding', 'required', 'fit', 'Raichand', 'household', 'Rahul', 'Anjali', 'Kajol', 'nanny', 'niece', 'brash', 'boisterous', 'lower-class', 'girl', 'who', 'sweet', 'shop', 'chaotic', 'colorful', 'Delhi', 'neighborhood', 'Chandni', 'Chowk', 'Opposites', 'attract', 'when', 'Anjali', 'father', 'dies', 'leaving', 'much', 'younger', 'sister', 'Pooja', 'played', 'adult', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'one', 'care', 'Rahul', 'father', 'marries', 'Anjali', 'stern', 'authoritarian', 'patriarch', 'promptly', 'favorite', 'son', 'what', 'be', 'unforgivable', 'betrayal', 'Rahul', 'new', 'wife', 'sister-in-law', 'move', 'London', 'When', 'Rohan', 'up', 'out', 'reconcile', 'two', 'enormous', 'egos', 'split', 'up', 'happy', 'family.The', 'superb', 'melodrama', 'as', 'thick', 'honey', 'darkly', 'sweet', 'film', 'whopping', 'three-and-a-half', 'hours', 'long', 'interminable', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', '10', 'may', 'test', 'endurance', 'die-hard', 'Bollywood', 'fans.-', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",N/A

Of course, the main thing we learn about that culture is that Indian people frequently break out into song and perform lavish dance routines in the street, but still, there are fascinating nuggets of cultural education here. Besides that though, the subject matter of Bollywood films have a universal appeal: love and marriage, family problems, tradition and modernity- and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham has those themes in spades, along with some catchy tunes (""Say Shava Shava"" for one), spectacular dance numbers and good clean fun. This movie is a bit long, but still a great introduction to Bollywood for non-Indians.",4,"Singing, dancing and happy endings- welcome to Bollywood!",1182556800,"06 23, 2007",2007,1266,"['interesting', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'have', 'Western', 'names', 'Bollywood', 'starting', 'gain', 'non-Indian', 'following', 'America', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'surprised', 'Bollywood', 'fun', 'most', 'dreadful', 'foreign', 'films', 'art', 'house', 'lemmings', 'go', 'raptures', 'Americans', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'inherent', 'entertainment', 'value', 'not', 'elite', 'turtleneck-wearing', 'professors', 'New', 'York', 'film', 'critics', 'genius', 'muddled', 'hallucinations', 'Italian', 'gasbag', 'Bollywood', 'Americans', 'can', 'enjoy', 'kinds', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'used', 'produce', 'learning', 'different', 'culture', 'course', 'main', 'thing', 'learn', 'culture', 'Indian', 'people', 'frequently', 'break', 'out', 'song', 'perform', 'lavish', 'dance', 'routines', 'street', 'still', 'are', 'fascinating', 'nuggets', 'cultural', 'education', 'here', 'though', 'subject', 'matter', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'have', 'universal', 'appeal', 'love', 'marriage', 'family', 'problems', 'tradition', 'modernity-', 'Kabhi', 'Khushi', 'Kabhie', 'Gham', 'themes', 'spades', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'Say', 'Shava', 'Shava', 'one', 'spectacular', 'dance', 'numbers', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'movie', 'bit', 'long', 'still', 'great', 'introduction', 'Bollywood', 'non-Indians']",N/A

764826,A9E7JZ1328JC,B0000AMAFR,Lawrence Louis,"[5, 8]","The perennial struggle of a couple who, being in love, goes against the traditions instilled in them by their parents, is common fare for the Indian cinematic industry (Bollywood). What makes ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham"" (K3G) so markedly distinct from the vast sea of Bollywood films that concern this topic, and what makes K3G much more meritorious, is its intimate portrayal of what happens in the aftermath of this conflict. Where typical Bollywood blockbusters such as ""Saathiya"" and ""Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai"" focus more of their story on the lives of the young couple that seek a relationship at the expense of severing the bonds with their families, K3G tends to emphasize the guilt and pain incurred by all sides - both children and parents - as children are estranged from their parents, when parents dogmatically preserve tradition, and children break free from the shackles of tradition, and rush headlong into romance. K3G gives a complex portrayal of Indian marriages and how central family life is to the whole affair, while also being empathetic to both the plight of the tradition bound parents and the romantically linked children, something uncharacteristic of Bollywood productions.K3G starts off when Rohan (Hrithik Roshan), who spent many years away from his family in boarding school, returns home. When Rohan inquires about the reasons behind his older brother, Rahul's (Shah Rukh Khan) departure, his grandmother tells of the events that lead to his brother severing ties with his father, Yashovardhan (Amitabh Bachchan), and his doting mother, Nandini. Hence, nearly half of K3G is told in a flashback. We learn that despite Rahul's adopted status, he is clearly the favorite of the two, ironically I suppose, because Yashovardhan and Nandini chose Rahul when they thought they could not produce a child naturally, hence Rahul seemed like a Godsend. Rahul, though reciprocating the intense love his parents had for him, eventually betrays, unintentionally, the patriarch of the family by falling in love and eloping with Anjali (Kajol), a girl who comes from a working class family whose background and lifestyle are much in contrast to the wealth, prestige, and opulence, that the Raichands enjoy. Thus, Rahul is disowned by his father. In the rest of K3G we see Rohan, who Rahul does not recognize because of years of separation, trying to coax his brother and his father into mending their relationship. Throughout this process we see how the void left by Rahul's flight and his father's dogmatism are affecting the family. Though Rahul has prospered financially on his own, with a seemingly bubbly family life, there is a definite sadness that wears on Rahul's face. Yashovardhan and Nandini though ostensibly close in the beginning of the film, are now slowly growning detached from each other.The acting from the three main stars (Bachchan, Roshan, and Khan) is superb. Each actor suffuses his performance with believable pathos. Granted tears flow so readily and profusely that they - especially Roshan and Khan - could probably fill up the Ganges ten times over, and this fact maybe a sign of overacting, but given the nature of the story, a little sappiness fits nicely. Yashovardhan's wife (Jaya Bachchan), is a woman who in keeping with her traditional role, stands by her man, even when he is mule headed. Yet at the same time Nandini shows uncharacteristic strength for a traditional Indian house wife, when she finally confronts her husband's stubbornness, and through some poignant dialogue that gives a tempered feminist reflection on conservative Indian culture, that respects tradition, but at the same time puts her husband and his pride in their place.The flaws in K3G are apparent when it decides to depart from its substance at specific intervals in its story, and seeks to be visually and verbally ostentatious. Maybe the producers, director, and writers behind K3G thought this would entertain western audiences, but like all other attempts at Bollywood to emulate the west, their efforts come across as just plain unnatural, or downright tacky. There are more tactful ways to demonstrate the affluence of the Raichands than by constantly showing them flying in planes, helicopters, having brand names emblazoned on their clothing (Indian film makers apparently forgot the subliminal portion of subliminal advertising) or driving a Lamborghini across a college campus. Sometimes I felt more like I was watching an Indian version of ""Life Styles of the Rich and Famous"" than a movie. Secondly, there is no need to interject trite English phrases into the dialogue, like when Roshan says ""What's up Dad?"" or when Pooja (Kareena Kapoor) obnoxiously exclaims ""Its raining men"", whenever she gets boy crazy.Since we are on the subject of gaudiness and superficiality, no one embodies this more than Kareena Kapoor. Here is a bit of advice for Bollywood producers and directors concerning this actress. Number one: SHE IS NOT GOOD LOOKING - she is just one of those ugly girls, like the ones you knew in high school, who got in with the popular crowd because her sister was attractive. Number two: SHE IS NOT A GOOD ACTRESS - if you are going to articulate western clich&eacute;s don't get an actress who sounds like a FOB articulating western clich&eacute;s. Number three: A WOMAN WHO BEHAVES AND LOOKS LIKE A FLOOZY- will turn off a mature audience. Bollywood would do well to never have Kareena Kapoor star in another major motion picture. Besides, her mannerisms and appearance are wasted on cinema when they would be better suited for other lucrative professions, say...as prostitute on the streets of Mumbai.Once you can overlook the loud display of commercialism, unrealistic demonstrations of wealth, and the most irritating offense to the eyes and ears, Kareena Kapoor, you will appreciate a film that has a lot of heartrending substance to it. You will witness a film that is quite a rarity in this day and age - one that sees the value in the spontaneity and romanticism of the new world and the traditional laden culture of the old world.",4,Substantive film concerning romanticism and tradition,1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,6089,"['perennial', 'struggle', 'couple', 'who', 'being', 'love', 'traditions', 'instilled', 'parents',

He overheard his grandmother talking about how Rohan's father asked his eldest son to leave home because he fell in love with a girl from the village. Rahul married the village girl and moved to London. So Rohan sets about a quest to find his older brother in London and bring him home to their father to try to make amends. Rohan's and Rahul's father (Amitabh Bachchan) is too proud to admit that he misses his son and knows that his wife (Jaya Bachchan), is traumatically heartbroken and without peace with Rahul gone.This is a very colorful film which really flaunts the lifestyle of the filthy rich. All the costumes are so beautiful, and all the songs in this film are truly enjoyable. This film also stars Kajol, Kareena Kapoor, and a small part with my favorite actress Rani Mukherjee.

And also, if you are familiar, at all, about Bollywood films, you will know that Amitabh Bachchan is the most famous actor in the world (perhaps only the US may be the least familiar with him).Karan Johar has just released his third film called ""Kal Ho Naa Ho"" which stars (again) Shahrukh Khan, and also Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta (also in ""Mission Kashmir"") .

764838,A2MHQOBLOUMCX,B0000AMAFR,"Scott L. McMillan ""Scott""","[1, 1]","This is my favorite Bollywood movie (watched it many times) - it is both contemporary and traditional, concerning the rich and middle class intertwining story, with a very impressive variety of dances & music (top quality, really like them).  Today I bought the  Blu-ray disc  (available with English sub-titles since Dec. 7, 2010).The cast is fantastic - How could you go wrong with Kajol & Kareena Kapoor, together with Shahrukh Khan & Amitabh Bachchan/Jaya Bhaduri (actual husband/wife) & Hrithik Roshan and a smaller part for Rani Mukherjee in just the first half.  Even the kids who play the 'young versions' of the brother & sister in the first half of the movie do a great acting job.There are several scenes with a lot of crying (women and men, young & old).  Still, for me, this is Kajol's most humorous/fun character of any movie she has graced.  Her character  'LOVES to dance'  (deep in her bones & soul) and Kajol really fits that role and is so beautiful.Kareena Kapoor's character is extremely over-the-top and hilarious (she pulls out all the stops - more extreme than 'Alicia Silverstone' did for her character in the 1995 movie 'Clueless').Alok Nath, who often plays the 'Dad' role very well (in many movies: 'Dil Hai Tumhaara' 2002,  Vivah 2006), has a small part but is great.Many of the same actors are together again from 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' (1998 - also bought this on  Blu-ray disc  today, available as of Dec. 7, 2010), including the child who is always counting stars, and there is even a brief (15 second) musical homage to the main melody from 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' in the romantic/fantasy dance music at the Egyptian pyramids(scene 10, song 3 - 'Suraj Hua Maddham' starting at about 1:07:29 on the DVD).The entire movie has flowing/smooth/natural acting (all actors totally commit to their characters, are in sync/prepared, giving the highest quality performances by all of them in this movie).  All of Hrithik Roshan's dancing is impressive, with his physical presence the sharpness/perfection of his dancing moves look great - lots of talent there.The intimate & public interaction of Amitabh Bachchan & Jaya Bhaduri (real-life husband & wife) is refreshing and there are some great moments caught on film (quiet times in their home, dancing together at a party, I'm sure they are in acting mode but they are a joy/fun to watch).The style of cinematography is top quality and unique (many scenes have a more natural feel because the director had people walk/dance in front and behind the main event/action of focus).  Sometimes you might wish that a beautiful dance scene shot didn't have the camera momentarily/partially blocked by someone passing in front, but overall it establishes the feel of the movie.Just a great experience, even though there are many melodramatic moments, this is a very enjoyable movie.****** SPOILER ALERT - ***************Actually there are 4 love stories in this movie -  In just the first half of the movie Rani Mukherjee's character is in Love with Shahrukh Khan's character, but he meets Kajol's character and falls in love with her which initiates the conflict/tragedy in the movie (those are 2 of the love stories).And there is the ongoing love story of the older Mother & Father, and the developing love story of Kajol's younger Sister and Shahrukh's younger Brother (the other 2 love stories in the movie).Rani Mukherjee's character is a 'class act' person, and she unfortunately loses out (but very gracefully).",5,"Favorite, superb entertainment",1292112000,"12 12, 2010",2010,3480,"['favorite', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'contemporary', 'traditional', 'concerning', 'rich', 'middle', 'class', 'intertwining', 'story', 'very', 'impressive', 'variety', 'dances', 'music', 'top', 'quality', 'really', 'Today', 'bought', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'available', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'Dec.', '7', '2010', '.The', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'How', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'Kajol', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'together', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan/Jaya', 'Bhaduri', 'actual', 'husband/wife', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'smaller', 'part', 'Rani', 'Mukherjee', 'just', 'first', 'half', 'Even', 'kids', 'who', 'play', ""'young"", 'versions', 'brother', 'sister', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'do', 'great', 'acting', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'lot', 'crying', 'women', 'men', 'young', 'old', 'Still', 'Kajol', 'most', 'humorous/fun', 'character', 'movie', 'graced', 'character', 'dance', 'deep', 'bones', 'soul', 'Kajol', 'really', 'role', 'so', 'beautiful.Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'character', 'extremely', 'over-the-top', 'hilarious', 'out', 'stops', 'more', 'extreme', ""'Alicia"", 'Silverstone', 'did', 'character', '1995', 'movie', ""'Clueless"", '.Alok', 'Nath', 'who', 'often', ""'Dad"", 'role', 'very', 'well', 'many', 'movies', ""'Dil"", 'Hai', 'Tumhaara', '2002', 'Vivah', '2006', 'small', 'part', 'great.Many', 'same', 'actors', 'are', 'together', 'again', ""'Kuch"", 'Kuch', 'Hota', 'Hai', '1998', 'also', 'bought', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'today', 'available', 'Dec.', '7', '2010', 'including', 'child', 'who', 'always', 'counting', 'stars', 'even', 'brief', '15', 'second', 'musical', 'homage', 'main', 'melody', ""'Kuch"", 'Kuch', 'Hota', 'Hai', 'romantic/fantasy', 'dance', 'music', 'Egyptian', 'pyramids', 'scene', '10', 'song', '3', ""'Suraj"", 'Hua', 'Maddham', 'starting', 'about', '1:07:29', 'DVD', '.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'flowing/smooth/natural', 'acting', 'actors', 'totally', 'commit', 'characters', 'are', 'sync/prepared', 'giving', 'highest', 'quality', 'performances', 'movie', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'dancing', 'impressive', 'physical', 'presence', 'sharpness/perfection', 'dancing', 'moves', 'look', 'great', 'lots', 'talent', 'there.The', 'intimate', 'public', 'interaction', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'Jaya', 'Bhaduri', 'real-life', 'husband', 'wife', 'refreshing', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'caught', 'film', 'quiet', 'times', 'home', 'dancing', 'together', 'party', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'acting', 'mode', 'are', 'joy/fun', 'watch', '.The', 'style', 'cinematography', 'top', 'quality', 'unique', 'many', 'scenes', 'have', 'more', 'natural', 'feel', 'director', 'had', 'people', 'walk/dance', 'front', 'main', 'event/action', 'focus', 'Sometimes', 'might', 'wish', 'beautiful', 'dance', 'scene', 'shot', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'camera', 'momentarily/partially', 'blocked', 'someone', 'passing', 'front', 'overall', 'feel', 'movie.Just', 'great', 'experience', 'even', 'are', 'many', 'melodramatic', 'moments', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '***************Actually', 'are', '4', 'love', 'stories', 'movie', 'just', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'Rani', 'Mukherjee', 'character', 'Love', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'character', 'Kajol', 'character', 'love', 'conflict/tragedy', 'movie', 'are', '2', 'love', 'stories', '.And', 'ongoing', 'love', 'story', 'older', 'Mother', 'Father', 'developing', 'love', 'story', 'Kajol', 'younger', 'Sister', 'Shahrukh', 'younger', 'Brother', 'other', '2', 'love', 'stories', 'movie', 'Mukherjee', 'character', ""'class"", 'act', 'person', 'unfortunately', 'out', 'very', 'gracefully']",N/A

764840,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B0000AMAFR,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[6, 6]","My introduction to Hindi cinema came through Netflix and I am hooked! The first film I ever saw was Jodhaa Akbar and obsession quickly took hold. Bollywood has a certain reputation that isn't entirely undeserved; however, it also has something that the vast majority of western films have been steadily losing for decades... true soul! Find a good Bollywood film (and it isn't as hard as the aforementioned reputation suggests) and you find something truly special. Kahbi Khushi Kahbie Gham is my first actual purchase and it truly is something special.As far as production values go, it's first class all the way. Amazing locations, sets, cinematography, musical numbers, costumes, and even amazing cars! Visually the only issues that truly irk me are how the make-up artist was so heavy handed with Kareena Kapoor-Khan (she just married Bollywood mega-star Saif Ali Khan), but it suited the character. The other is overuse of the bloody wind machine indoors. Nobody's hair no matter how obscenely healthy blows like that inside!The music is extremely good, especially in the second half because it didn't take me long to get a feel for the words and start singing along. The dancing is outstanding of course, and I loved how the choreography played to each actor's individual strengths. That way, everyone shines brightly. That's incredibly hard to do when you have other men dancing with Mr. Roshan.Nevertheless, don't be fooled despite the lavishness of the settings and the glamorous world this story takes place in this is a very simple movie and like with anything simple, from boiling an egg to changing a light bulb, if you do it wrong it's a disaster. I say this as someone who's wrecked boiled eggs and screwed up changing light bulbs! Fortunately, I think that everyone involved with this movie knows that, and this movie succeeds because of it. Karan Johar's direction is outstanding, obviously, this was a passion project for him and it shows. However, even with that this movie hinges on one thing and really one thing only... the cast!The cast is literally the ""who's who"" of Bollywood both when the movie was first released and now. You've got Mr. and Mrs. Bachchan, two living legends. Mr. Khan, who if not now will be a living legend in Indian cinema soon enough. Mr. Roshan, if he ever go attempts world domination will have nearly every living person on earth eating out of his hand. Kajol, (no prefixes just Kajol) who can't help making a splash the second she comes on screen. Ms. Kapoor-Khan is actually the weakest link here but extremely good. That's only the leads... one must give hearty praise to three vitally important women but still minor characters... Achala Sachdev and Sushma Seth, play the respective grandmothers to our heroes, and Farida Jalal as DJ the beloved nanny, are simply exquisite in their tiny but memorable roles. Each lovely lady leaves you desperately wanting more!I'm a sucker for character so I have to break these down one by one... first up is Mr. Bachchan. He's known as Big B. in India and it fits. Everything about him is massive, physically he's a skyscraper, his intelligence shoots out of his eyes like laser beams, his charisma and charm is overwhelming. This is a man who clearly loves life and *everything* about it. Mix all of the qualities in the man with an amazing talent, and a simple truth immerges. That truth is simply this, if anyone else had played Yash Raichand, you'd hate him. Yash Raichand is an Autocrat in the best and worse sense. His actions would have been completely unforgivable if he'd been played as a villain. Mr. Johar and Mr. Bachchan were very savvy making Yash a complicated man, even a hero in many ways. He's a literal and figurative giant, but one with feet of clay. Throughout the film, you watch as Yash's stubborn pride continues to eat away at his loved ones, yet you never once will feel he is a bad or malicious man. With good reason, he's a good man, even a great one. You never forget that despite the weaknesses and the lies he tells himself, he loves his family more than life. The truth is, the person most hurt by Yash Raichand, IS Yash Raichand. Kudos to Mr. Bachchan for creating a character you can be completely furious with, but still root for.Behind every great man is a greater woman! Yeah it's a massive clich&eacute;, and not a little feminist, but in this case absolutely true! Just as nobody else but Mr. Bachchan can play Yash, nobody but Mrs. Bachchan can play Nandini Raichand. This character could easily be disliked if handled improperly, but no such thing happens. Thanks to skill, talent, and, a spine made out of pure titanium Mrs. Bachchan deftly creates a character who personifies a nearly mystical maternal love, a devoted wife, and broken woman. Not only that but if the moment calls for it, she grabs a scene from the charismatic men surrounding her and keeps it all for herself using only two lines. Then in another moment, she can take her giant of a husband and cut him down to nearly an afterthought. Don't believe me? See the movie, she can and does! I'm convinced that only a real-life wife can be capable of such a feat.Mr. Khan I think by nature is a scene-stealer. Put a camera on the man and he does not like to let it go! For me personally, his acting style can get overwhelming. I only mention this because I have seen him act with more restraint in several films and enjoyed him more. That said, he is nothing less then brilliant in this film. He is the favorite son, he is the center of his parent's world. The family revolves around Rahul Raichand and he plays the part accordingly. During the first half, he's cocky, charming, spoiled, kind, but absolutely clueless! This is basically the character Mr. Khan perfected and patented in India as his own. During the second half, he's still cocky, charming, less spoiled, kind, and only slightly clueless. What makes his part unique here is that he isn't the hero. In fact, it wouldn't be wrong to say his character is the equivalent to the 'damsel in distress.' In retrospect, it takes guts to do it. I mean, this guy is referred to as ""The king of Bollywood, and The king of romance"" he's an icon! Rahul Raichand is in desperate need of rescuing! He makes good of every tool in his acting repertoire here. There's nothing new but sometimes it's enough just to do something incredibly well and he does. Still, in order to act with a man like Mr. Khan you cannot be a shrinking violet.This brings me to Kajol! Thank God, they cast her as Anjali. Today in western films, the closest thing to true pairings in films I can think of is Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci. Back in the golden age of Hollywood, studios would pair stars together in many films. Astaire and Rogers, Powell and Loy, Flynn and De Havilland... such things were routine. Now, something like that almost never happens. In Bollywood, they're keeping the tradition alive and well! Kajol and Mr. Kahn have done six films together to date, this one was number five. I'll confess right now I've only seen one other, the iconic Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, (if you haven't seen it, SEE IT) and I think their magic together approaches Tracy and Hepburn territory. While Mr. Khan might be a scene-stealer who can't help it, Kajol works with it. There's no confusion about who to look at here, it's simple you look at both of them looking at each other. They're completely natural as a couple or as they say in Hindi, a jodi. From the moment their eyes meet, you find yourself thinking there might be something to that kismet idea.As I've hinted before, Rahul is a little-over-the-top. Believe me he's got nothing on Anjali! To say she's a firecracker, is putting it mildly. Tempestuous is a more apt description, but it still feels wrong. Anjali is Rahul's equal for histrionics and then some. There is nothing about the woman that isn't passionate. Restraint is not a word in her lexicon period; it doesn't matter if the lexicon is Punjabi, Hindi, or English. Kajol bites into Anjali and any surrounding scenery with gusto, even the few moments when she's calm, she's full of passion. Although her character is like a really fast roller coaster, this is a good thing. Rahul is someone easily bored, and Anjali is anything but boring! In fact, he sums her up perfectly, ""she's slightly insane, actually she's completely insane."" Yes she is! She also walks a pretty fine line regarding bigotry here, but Kajol and Karan Johar smartly never cross it. Kajol manages to take anything approaching offensiveness and infuse it with such a deep feeling of homesickness, that you feel like Anjali would actually get along well with everyone if she weren't hurting so bad.In the spirit of total honesty, I probably wouldn't buy a movie just because Kajol is in it, but there's no denying she played this part to the hilt, and she did a fantastic job. She's an icon in her own right, and you've got to respect a woman who panics over the amount of Punjabi lines, a language she does not speak, nails it, and steals a scene from Mr. Bachchan!Warning! The following will probably read like a love letter to Mr. Roshan but I am *trying* to be objective here. I can say with certainty that despite my admiration I am sticking to the facts... Rohan Raichand is the hero of this film, that's not me talking that's Karan Johar. Mr. Roshan gets 5th billing here, he's the ""new guy"" compared to the rest of the cast, but he's a full-fledged superstar in his own right, even at this early point. But he's up against legends and icons, and he's responsible for holding the movie together. Without Rohan there is no plot. So it isn't like there's any pressure here right?To put it in perspective, imagine a young actor wildly popular say like... Robert Pattinson, (I've never seen any of his movies, but he's the most popular young'n I can think of) being put in a movie with Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. Same principle here, only with a lot of musical numbers. Mr. Roshan never puts a foot or a tear wrong. I've watched this movie a dozen times since I got it, and every time I'm blown away by him. Rohan is a simple guy, he loves his family. That's it in a nutshell, simple right? Wrong! While the character may be simple the balancing act required by this performance would make a seasoned tight-rope walker cringe.The thing I appreciated most about Mr. Roshan's acting is that in a movie filled with people who chew scenes he never once tries to be the center of attention. He's focusing on everyone else and that makes the audience focus with him. Oh yes, he's easily the best looking person on film and I would be lying if I said that it wasn't taken advantage of, but even with that, when the issue comes up he focuses on the other actor. I can't tell you how, that would be giving it away. The entire performance was refreshingly ego free, (I like Mr. Khan but he does have an ego) and because of that, you root for him.You can't talk about a Hrithik Roshan performance and not spend a little time mentioning the dancing. The man might be the best dancer of his generation on film. I'm talking about in the movies here not all dancers everywhere, but even then he's still near the top. He defies the laws of physics, and he's the best dancer in the cast. Still, he never uses that to upstage anyone. During the last musical number when he's not center stage he adapts so that the group dance is in-synch. He never out-dances Ms. Kapoor-Khan and does his best to make her look sublime. It's entrancing to watch.Some actors, are actors who can dance, others are dancers who get into acting, Mr. Roshan is neither of those. One skill isn't better than the other, both are superlative. It's so easy to fixate on his looks, I've often seen him refered to as ""the Greek god of Bollywood"" and frankly I'd bet he outshines the Mythical Apollo. But to write him off as just a hunk is a tragic mistake. This man still battles the stammering that's plagued him as a child yet in this film he speaks eloquent dialogue and a tongue-twister that would set my hair on fire!He was diagnosed with scoliosis at age 21 and told that dancing well enough for movies wasn't possible. He can use swords, ride horses, and sing (check out Jodhaa Akbar for the first two, check out Kites, and Guzaarish for the singing) the man can do it all! Oh and he works hard for that perfect body, the face and eyes God and genetics took care of.Last but not least we come to the newly wedded Ms. Kapoor-Khan! For the record she's not now related to the Mr. Khan in this film. Pooja is a wannabe ""mean girl"" who's really bad at it. I think Karan Johar might have watched Clueless one too many times. I swear, the first fifteen minutes with her in the movie is almost exactly like it, only they're speaking Hindi of course. My problem with that is this, while it works in a high school setting, I find it a little implausible for someone in college. Hey, I knew some rich idiots in college, none like 'Poo.' (What was Johar thinking when it came to that nickname?)Like Mr. Khan, Ms. Kapoor-Khan practically made a brand for herself playing a type. In her case, various shallow, high glamour girls, with a secret heart of gold. But don't let that fool you into thinking she can't act. She is definitely capable of doing more tricks and the fact that she does these sweet but vain girl so well is kind of the proof. For other demonstrations of her talent, try Tashan and Mrs. Khanna (she's even more beautiful in both because she's got beautiful makeup).She isn't a great dancer. She's certainly good, but not great, what sells it for me is that she knows she's nowhere near Mr. Roshan's level so she works hard and amps up the fun. Filming dance numbers is a torturous, grueling, undertaking so if an actor can convince you they're having a blast, it can make all the difference and she does. She has great chemistry with all the players, and her banter with Mr. Roshan is very funny. Despite being the week link in the cast, she does a good job.Still, even with her talent and beauty I wish Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan was in the role! Why? Because, just like Mr. Khan and Kajol are the perfect on-screen jodi, Mr. Roshan and Ms. Rai Bachchan transcend great acting into something more. Oh well, if wishes were horses...Special acknowledgement has to go to the kiddies in this movie. Young Rahul, was played by Mr. Khan's actual son Aryan! He was adorable. All of the kids do great jobs but I admit to some annoyance with Young Rohan and Young Pooja.Young Rohan AKA Fatty is played by Kavish Majmudar. He certainly must have been everything they wanted, but the poor kid had the most annoying voice on the planet! I don't know if his voice was changing or if he was told to whine every line he had. Either way, the poor thing does tend to get on my nerves. He's a fine actor though, (would it have killed him to wear green contact lenses?)Young Pooja played by, Malvika Raaj really didn't have anything to do but spout that wickedly sadistic tongue twister, but she deserves an award just for that! Unfortunately it was the only time she registered any charisma at all. But then again how could she in a role so small?Ladies and Gentlemen the star of the kids, Jibraan Khan! I have no clue if he's related to any other Bollywood Khan's. He plays Krishi Raichand, Anajali and Rahul's son. This kid is AWESOME! But he's not a kid anymore, now. Out of a cast of scene-stealers he takes every one he's in! Unfortunately I can't find the name of the little girl who played Annette the little English girl next door, but she was a gem!Finally, I can't wrap this up without saying something about Rani Mukerji! She has a special appearance and she's magnificent! She gets to show off her true dancing talent, she looks incredible, and she got a raw deal! In my fantasy world, someone played by Aamir Khan sweeps her off her feet, and makes her forget all about Rahul! Sorry for the spoiler but that one can't be helped.The DVD itself is very good quality, especially considering the extremely reasonable price. If I had to complain about something it would be the lack of deleted scenes. I wanted to see Rohan interact more with Anjali and Krishi. Still I am NEVER lending this movie to ANYONE! It's mine, mine, mine! I'm so glad I bought it.",5,You Don't Love People Because They're Perfect!
