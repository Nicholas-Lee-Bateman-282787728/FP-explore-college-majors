1412274,A2TLCFD8RE12Z1,B004KKPQMI,"AGD ""Jonas Mac""","[5, 8]","To put it as simply as possible, the Danes have put American, English and Australian TV to shame with this must-see murder mystery thriller. The acting is so well done, so nuanced, it seems almost ducumentarian in it's approach, without of course the usual boredom that can come along with watching the average documentary, the story unfurls like some great novel of our time, and midway through you start to believe that almost every character being investigated could be the culprit and to be honest, I have never been so on the edge of my seat for close on twenty hours. I would challenge anyone not to be completely devastated by the end of the very first episode, I was in tears myself, and had to, get this, HAD TO, rewind to watch the last ten minutes of that episode straight away. It has been compared to The Wire and I think this, although meant as a complitment, is a bit misguided. In Australia we have a show that is touted as our best effort called the Underbelly series, and if compared to other Aussie shows like Home and Away or Rescue it does tower somewhat above the rest, but if you compare this show to The Wire, is comes off as a bit of a midget in a room full of giants. The makers of Underbelly think that making 50% of the show in slow-mo with some grudgy hip hop sound track comes off as being artistic, instead of looking like the majority of music videos around today, somewhat sleasy and dull to the senses after a short while. And one could say the same of The Wire, when compared to the dross of NCIS / CIS / CLOSER'S type of shows being churned out of the Hollywood factory of Campbell Soups cooks passing themselves off as directors and producers, it does tower somewhat, however, once again when comepared to what the Danes have been able to pull off here with The Killing, The Wire too comes off as a rather lazy, indulgent little shadow in a room full of blinding light. The Danes don't seem to need to resort to the usual onslaught of HBO sleaze and filth passed off as necessary 'language' and completely needless and pointless grapthic sex scenes that the makers of Oz and The Wire so seem to enjoy corrupting our homes with - that's just simply shock over substance and laziness and sleaziness for the sake of it to the upmost. So when I saw that The Killing was being compared to The Wire, I was a bit concerned. But, as it turned out, I had absolutely no need to be. These writers can sell their wares without having to resort to needless sleaze and filth. And don't get me started on the depth and style of the camerawork! Dazzling! The lead actress was simply amazing in this role, utilising a very understated approach, and a nice surprise to see an atractive female in a lead role that one would see walking down the average street in the average town, a beauty highlighted just as much by flaw as by perfection, as opposed to the nipped/tucked/sucked and hoisted Hollywood bimbo-models we usually have to put up with on television from the US of A, she reminded me of a young Jenny Agutter from Teh Railway Children and An American Werewolf in London fame. Her parnter, Jen, was played just as brillantly, once again with an understated passion just glowering below the observable surface - and what a wonderful change to see a married family man as a lead character - Boy! But you don't get much of that from tinsel-town these days either - they seem so stuck on their anti-hero model that unless the hero is a relativistic mishmash of disgusting behaviours filled with addictions of one kind or another that the idea of a good man who loves his wife and adores his children seems to them a concept so dull that it does not bear worth thinking about. Hollywoods idea of an interesting cop is a zen ex con who will allow some murderers off while he sleeps around crunching assorted fruit products! I know! Sad, isn't it. Anyhoo, back to The Killing: The family affected by the tragedy in this story, are, one could fairly state, the very heart of this incredible show, and the writing was such that one is enticed along in to experience their devastation; and what devastation it truly is. I cannot recommend this show, which is really a piece of art, highly enough. It is one of the very best things that television has ever broadcast in any country. This should be required viewing everywhere and if you have not seen this thriller from Copenhagen you are doing yourself a great injustice. The only downside is every other thriller after this is going to seem somewhat artificial. I am currently watching the American version and so far - cudos to them - they are pretty much sticking to what the Danes have done, just speeding up the process somewhat into 13 episodes instead of the 20 from the original. So to conclude, great, great story, fantastic writing that doesn't treat the viewer as an idiot who needs to be silver-spoon fed all the clues along the way, great production values, wonderful camera work, eerie, dark atmostphere throughout, the acting from everyone, from the charismatic politian to the smallest, seemingly insignificant role, was masterful, the actors protraying the family affected did so good a job that one's heart was left like a tattered sail hung on half mast after many, many scenes. But it is the two main police detectives that stand tall above a very towering cast. It has not been done this good ever and I think it will be a long time before anyone, anywhere, will be able to top what has been accomplished here. Do youself a favour and buy this now. Don't let the price or subtitles put you off - I hate watching things with subtitles, but this was so well written and acted that I soon adjusted to the point that I didn't even notice after a very short while. Like I said, I cannot recommend this thriller from Denmark highly enough and I think people everywhere involved in TV could learn a great deal about how to hook an audience and reel them in in a manner that transends the normal viewing trends around today. To all the people who made this show - Thank you so much, you gave me a great 18+ hours of nail-biting, heart rending, edge of my seat entertainment, and oh, the tears I shed throughout! Can't wait to see Season Two. Loved it! Loved it completelty from beginning to end. And I can't say fairer than that.",5,MURDERIOUSLY GOOD - AN ABSOLUTE KILLER!,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,6309,"['put', 'as', 'simply', 'possible', 'Danes', 'have', 'put', 'American', 'English',

1412277,A2P3PPVN379V79,B004KKPQMI,"FBI ""Film Buff Inc.""","[0, 0]","I have watched all three seasons of this excellent Danish production and enjoyed it immensely from start to finish. The plots are complex, the casting is outstanding, the stories are tragic and sometimes horrific, but very contemporary and courageous, confronting what goes on in this world that few other series have confronted so superbly, so directly and without getting on a soapbox. The Danish obviously do not feel the need to give us a splatter-fest where the gun is the only answer, nor is there any gratuitous nudity (very little nudity at all). It takes us to a world, a culture where the troubles of people just trying to do their job and navigate the myriad of roadblocks and resident sociopaths (careerists who will cover up anything to get ahead) along the way. I was very sad to part company with Sarah Lund, her boss Brix, her fellow officers, and the myriad politicians and staffers who make up each series. Intricately crafted, highly intelligent television that only comes along once every bluish moon. I couldn't fault it. Magnificent photography, acting, screenplays, but restrained, sparse, allowing silences and doubt to hover so that we never know 'the truth' until the very end of each series. The best series I have watched in a long, long time. But it is definitely adult viewing. Something, once I have had a break from it, I intend to return to like a treasured book. The team behind this aimed very high rather than other country's standard fare which is just churned out almost mindlessly. No wonder Danes were reportedly transfixed and it became their highest rating drama of all time if my memory serves me correct. An extraordinary, stomach-churning, deeply sad, anger-inducing about what power can and does get away with, and so on. No plot spoilers here, but if you watch one great series (and unfortunately there are only three seasons), be sure to watch this.The Killing - Complete Season 1 - 5-DVD Box Set ( Forbrydelsen (Forbrytelsen) ) ( The Killing - Complete Season One ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom]",5,Brilliant!,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,2068,"['have', 'watched', 'three', 'seasons', 'excellent', 'Danish', 'production', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'start', 'finish', 'plots', 'are', 'complex', 'casting', 'outstanding', 'stories', 'are', 'tragic', 'sometimes', 'horrific', 'very', 'contemporary', 'courageous', 'confronting', 'what', 'world', 'few', 'other', 'series', 'have', 'confronted', 'so', 'superbly', 'so', 'directly', 'getting', 'soapbox', 'Danish', 'obviously', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'need', 'give', 'splatter-fest', 'where', 'gun', 'only', 'answer', 'there', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'very', 'little', 'nudity', 'world', 'culture', 'where', 'troubles', 'people', 'just', 'trying', 'do', 'job', 'navigate', 'myriad', 'roadblocks', 'resident', 'sociopaths', 'careerists', 'who', 'will', 'cover', 'up', 'anything', 'get', 'ahead', 'way', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'part', 'company', 'Sarah', 'Lund', 'boss', 'Brix', 'fellow', 'officers', 'myriad', 'politicians', 'staffers', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'series', 'Intricately', 'crafted', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'television', 'only', 'along', 'once', 'bluish', 'moon', 'could', ""n't"", 'fault', 'Magnificent', 'photography', 'acting', 'screenplays', 'restrained', 'sparse', 'allowing', 'silences', 'doubt', 'hover', 'so', 'never', 'know', 'truth', 'very', 'end', 'series', 'best', 'series', 'have', 'watched', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'definitely', 'adult', 'viewing', 'Something', 'once', 'have', 'had', 'break', 'intend', 'return', 'like', 'treasured', 'book', 'team', 'aimed', 'very', 'high', 'rather', 'other', 'country', 'standard', 'fare', 'just', 'churned', 'out', 'almost', 'mindlessly', 'wonder', 'Danes', 'were', 'reportedly', 'transfixed', 'became', 'highest', 'rating', 'drama', 'time', 'memory', 'correct', 'extraordinary', 'stomach-churning', 'deeply', 'sad', 'anger-inducing', 'what', 'power', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'so', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', 'watch', 'one', 'great', 'series', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'seasons', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'this.The', 'Killing', 'Complete', 'Season', '1', '5-DVD', 'Box', 'Set', 'Forbrydelsen', 'Forbrytelsen', 'Killing', 'Complete', 'Season', 'One', 'NON-USA', 'FORMAT', 'PAL', 'Reg.2', 'Import', 'United', 'Kingdom', ']']",The Killing: Season 1 - 5 Boxed Set

Chainsmoking Meyer has to wait until Lund has left in order to fully take over the reins.Two of the most powerful performances in the series are given by the actors playing Nanna's parents Theis and Pernille Birk Larsen. Ann Eleonora Jrgensen and Bjarne Henriksen's characters show the extent of coping with the death of a teenage daughter and the frustrations of the murder hunt. I particularly admire Anna's performances which she handles perfectly as well as her excellent scenes with the two Birk Larsen boys.A third storyline running through the series is the Copenhagen Mayoral Election involving Troels Hartmann (Lars Mikkelsen) and his co-workers and rivals at City Hall. The politicians lives are disrupted due to the murder and we fully explore political backstabbing at a local coalition level.Having been successfully screened around Europe and Australia, The Killing has also had a US remake, which screened the first 13 episodes in the spring of 2011.If you like a decent crime drama and appreciate fine quality acting, then The Killing is for you.You may be a little reluctant to invest nearly 20 hours in a subtitled drama, but you'll be glad you did!You may like to take a look at other offerings featuring Ann Eleonora Jrgensen (In Your Hands, Italian For Beginners, Just Like Home) and Lars Mikkelsen (Flame and Citron, Headhunter).Admirers of Lars Mikkelsen may ike to know that his brother Mads appeared in another fine Danish police series Unit One (Rejseholdet), a 32 part series which has been released in Australia on Region 4 DVD.Enjoy the series.

1412286,A1TPW86OHXTXFC,B004KKPQMI,"prisrob ""pris,""","[55, 59]","I first saw 'The Killing' last year on US television on the AMC channel. This was the US version, and I quickly became entranced with this remarkable crime thriller, taking place in Seattle. The ending of year one was very disappointing, the characterization and plot line was remarkable.And, then I had a chance to view the original Danish version, ' Forbrydelsen' series. Is it possible for one person to view 20 episodes in a week? This series is so fantastic that I was compelled to view all 5 discs, 4 episodes per disc. I also feel compelled to say that if you have a chance to view this series, grab it, run as fast as possible to your DVR, and prepare for a siege, load up on liquids and food.'Forbrydelsen'  takes place in Copenhagen. The city we see seldom has sun, we see the rain, dreary, crime ridden side of Copenhagen.  Sarah Lund, played by Sofie Grabol, plays the lead Detective Inspector. As we meet her she is getting ready to leave her job to start a new life with her fiancee and son in Stockholm. And, then, on her last day, after the party and the good-byes, a horrific crime is committed. However, all we know at first is that a young woman's bloody underclothes are found in a wooded area. Lund is called and with her acute detectives intuition moves on to solve the crime. Her partner, excuse the expression, in crime, is the new Detective Inspector, Jan Meyer. He expects to be in charge but as the case proceeds, he accepts Sarah is staying. We don't know much about Sarah and Jan. But as time moves along, their characters are fleshed out, and we come to accept and understand them better, so it is easier to predict how they will react. We meet the murder victim in flashbacks, the parents, the family, the working colleagues of the parents. Inserted into this storyline is an entire political campaign. The entire series kept me on the edge of my seat.Each episode depicts a day in the life of the crime. We follow the Detectives as they proceed to develop their case. We meet the politics of the police department, their colleagues and games that are played there. The family is the most entrancing part of this series. We are with the mother and father as they find out their daughter is missing, and we are with them when they see their daughter at the morgue. We are with them in their disbelief, confusion and anger. We are with them as they attempt to work through their grief. This is remarkable acting. There was not one of the episodes that I thought was too slow. Each episode held me in suspense. There were no shortcuts, nothing fussy or fancy, superb acting. I remembered an old television show, depicting historical events and titled ""You Are There'. Well, this is exactly how I felt. I was there, with the detectives, the family, the murderer, the politicians and their people. Superb seems like such a meager word to describe this series. My favorite series until 'Forbrydelsen' was 'The Wire'. I have moved on, 'Forbrydelsen' rates number one for me. The series has subtitles and in my experience subtitles add to the film. I did not miss one word of this fabulous series.The  wonderful experience of this series was that each character had some relationship to someone else, so that the entire cast was brought into the fold. How this clever script was able to manage this was from the extraordinary writing. I understand there is a Season Two of ""Forbrydelsen' and a soon to be Season Three.  Who do I remember most from this series? Sarah Lund, Sofie Grabol, who plays Lund is an exceptional actress and her expressions relay more than than her voice at times. I am anxious to see how she plays in the next set of series. Superlatives reign!Highly Recommended.  prisrob 10-13-11The Killing - Complete Series 1 - 6-DVD Box Set  The Killing - The Complete Series One  Forbrydelsen (Forbrytelsen  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.0 Import - Australia]",5,A Slice Of Genius,1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,3893,"['first', 'saw', ""'The"", 'Killing', 'last', 'year', 'US', 'television', 'AMC', 'channel', 'was', 'US', 'version', 'quickly', 'became', 'entranced', 'remarkable', 'crime', 'thriller', 'taking', 'place', 'Seattle', 'ending', 'year', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'characterization', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'remarkable.And', 'then', 'had', 'chance', 'view', 'original', 'Danish', 'version', 'Forbrydelsen', 'series', 'possible', 'one', 'person', 'view', '20', 'episodes', 'week', 'series', 'so', 'fantastic', 'was', 'compelled', 'view', '5', 'discs', '4', 'episodes', 'disc', 'also', 'feel', 'compelled', 'say', 'have', 'chance', 'view', 'series', 'grab', 'run', 'as', 'fast', 'possible', 'DVR', 'prepare', 'siege', 'up', 'liquids', 'food', 'place', 'Copenhagen', 'city', 'see', 'seldom', 'sun', 'see', 'rain', 'dreary', 'crime', 'ridden', 'side', 'Copenhagen', 'Sarah', 'Lund', 'played', 'Sofie', 'Grabol', 'lead', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'meet', 'getting', 'ready', 'leave', 'job', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'fiancee', 'son', 'Stockholm', 'then', 'last', 'day', 'party', 'good-byes', 'horrific', 'crime', 'committed', 'However', 'know', 'first', 'young', 'woman', 'bloody', 'underclothes', 'are', 'found', 'wooded', 'area', 'Lund', 'called', 'acute', 'detectives', 'intuition', 'moves', 'solve', 'crime', 'partner', 'expression', 'crime', 'new', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'Jan', 'Meyer', 'be', 'charge', 'case', 'proceeds', 'Sarah', 'staying', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Sarah', 'Jan', 'time', 'moves', 'along', 'characters', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'come', 'accept', 'understand', 'better', 'easier', 'predict', 'how', 'will', 'react', 'meet', 'murder', 'victim', 'flashbacks', 'parents', 'family', 'working', 'colleagues', 'parents', 'Inserted', 'storyline', 'entire', 'political', 'campaign', 'entire', 'series', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat.Each', 'episode', 'day', 'life', 'crime', 'follow', 'Detectives', 'proceed', 'develop', 'case', 'meet', 'politics', 'police', 'department', 'colleagues', 'games', 'are', 'played', 'there', 'family', 'most', 'entrancing', 'part', 'series', 'are', 'mother', 'father', 'find', 'out', 'daughter', 'missing', 'are', 'when', 'see', 'daughter', 'morgue', 'are', 'disbelief', 'confusion', 'anger', 'are', 'attempt', 'work', 'grief', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'episodes', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'slow', 'episode', 'held', 'suspense', 'were', 'shortcuts', 'nothing', 'fussy', 'fancy', 'superb', 'acting', 'remembered', 'old', 'television', 'show', 'depicting', 'historical', 'events', 'titled', 'Are', 'Well', 'exactly', 'how', 'felt', 'was', 'there', 'detectives', 'family', 'murderer', 'politicians', 'people', 'Superb', 'meager', 'word', 'describe', 'series', 'My', 'favorite', 'series', ""'Forbrydelsen"", 'was', ""'The"", 'Wire', 'have', 'moved', 'rates', 'number', 'one', 'series', 'subtitles', 'experience', 'subtitles', 'add', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'miss', 'one', 'word', 'fabulous', 'series.The', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'series', 'was', 'character', 'had', 'relationship', 'someone', 'else', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'brought', 'fold', 'How', 'clever', 'script', 'was', 'able', 'manage', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'writing', 'understand', 'Season', 'Two', 'Forbrydelsen', 'soon', 'be', 'Season', 'Three', 'Who', 'do', 'remember', 'most', 'series', 'Sarah', 'Lund', 'Sofie', 'Grabol', 'who', 'Lund', 'exceptional', 'actress', 'expressions', 'relay', 'more', 'voice', 'times', 'am', 'anxious', 'see', 'how', 'next', 'set', 'series', 'reign', 'Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '10-13-11The', 'Killing', 'Complete', 'Series', '1', '6-DVD', 'Box', 'Set', 'Killing', 'Complete', 'Series', 'One', 'Forbrydelsen', 'Forbrytelsen', '[', 'NON-USA', 'FORMAT', 'PAL', 'Reg.0', 'Import', 'Australia', ']']",The Killing: Season 1 - 5 Boxed Set
