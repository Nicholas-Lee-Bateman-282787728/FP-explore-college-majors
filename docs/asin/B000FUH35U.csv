Anyway, the message being reiterated throughout the movie is for big girls to love their bodies, have more confidence, and go for their dreams.

She tried to use diet pills, but she kept eating food and getting into verbal assaults.  But suddenly, the bitter, disgrunted woman had a chance of a lifetime.  She just happened to win a five-day resort with her friends, so they travel in style.  From there, she just happened to find an attractive Nigerian doctor, who found her alluring because he just happens to be into hefty women.  At one point, these two and their friends go to a Nigerian feast where people who gobble up food is a compliment.  And they all live happily ever after.Let me understand the message in ""Phat Girlz"": if you're a fat woman, hope that you win a lavishing location so you can find a man of your dreams who's in chubby, and if you want to be with him, you have to eat lots of food.  That is messed up.  Okay, that's not really the case in this movie, Jasmin has to believe in her inner beauty, be confident, follow her dreams and such, but the first-half is certainly manipulated to be that way.  I don't like how it's set up by chance, not by how Jamzin initiated herself to eventually find her dream man, so it was rather phony.  I also don't like how the film was shot, how the flashbacks were done on the cheap, and how goofy and mean the jokes are, like the burger joint scene.  The movie's heart is in the right place, but it's poorly told. Not to mention this is quite a morbid fantasy.It's not a good movie, but to be fair, ""Phat Girlz"" does have one merit worth mentioning. It occured in a scene when Mo'Nique when through a midlife crisis after leaving the resort, and she was sobbing like crazy and then trashed her own room out of metamorphosis (preceed by a TV showing some fat lady verbally degrading herself).  That was so depressing, almost unnecessarily so given the previous scene a while ago where Jazmin goes to a fast-food place called 'fatass burger'; it's like Johnny 5's tragic moment in ""Short Circuit 2"" or Adam Sandler's last moments in ""Click"", having one downer moment in an otherwise obnoxious wacky comedy. She really went out at that point, and in my personal opinion, her one burst of hysteria might be more shocking that her entire performance in ""Precious"".  That's probably because I was surprised.Also, that Kendra C. Johnson actress doesn't look bad for a woman of her stature.",2,"It's big, but it's not bold",1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,2465,"[""Mo'Nique"", 'Jasmin', 'Biltmore', 'ha', 'ha', 'get', 'inspiring', 'fashion', 'designer', 'who', 'disheartened', 'world', 'where', 'skinny', 'women', 'are', 'ironically', 'living', 'large', 'tried', 'use', 'diet', 'pills', 'kept', 'eating', 'food', 'getting', 'verbal', 'assaults', 'suddenly', 'bitter', 'disgrunted', 'woman', 'had', 'chance', 'lifetime', 'just', 'happened', 'win', 'five-day', 'resort', 'friends', 'travel', 'style', 'there', 'just', 'happened', 'find', 'attractive', 'Nigerian', 'doctor', 'who', 'found', 'alluring', 'just', 'be', 'hefty', 'women', 'one', 'point', 'two', 'friends', 'go', 'Nigerian', 'feast', 'where', 'people', 'who', 'gobble', 'up', 'food', 'compliment', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Let', 'understand', 'message', 'Phat', 'Girlz', ""'re"", 'fat', 'woman', 'hope', 'win', 'lavishing', 'location', 'can', 'find', 'man', 'dreams', 'who', 'chubby', 'want', 'be', 'have', 'eat', 'lots', 'food', 'messed', 'up', 'Okay', 'not', 'really', 'case', 'movie', 'Jasmin', 'believe', 'inner', 'beauty', 'be', 'confident', 'follow', 'dreams', 'such', 'first-half', 'certainly', 'manipulated', 'be', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'set', 'up', 'chance', 'not', 'how', 'Jamzin', 'initiated', 'eventually', 'find', 'dream', 'man', 'was', 'rather', 'phony', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'how', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'done', 'cheap', 'how', 'goofy', 'mean', 'jokes', 'are', 'burger', 'joint', 'scene', 'movie', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'poorly', 'told', 'Not', 'mention', 'quite', 'morbid', 'fantasy.It', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'be', 'fair', 'Phat', 'Girlz', 'have', 'one', 'merit', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'occured', 'scene', 'when', ""Mo'Nique"", 'when', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'leaving', 'resort', 'was', 'sobbing', 'crazy', 'then', 'trashed', 'own', 'room', 'metamorphosis', 'preceed', 'TV', 'showing', 'fat', 'lady', 'verbally', 'degrading', 'was', 'so', 'depressing', 'almost', 'unnecessarily', 'so', 'given', 'previous', 'scene', 'while', 'ago', 'where', 'Jazmin', 'fast-food', 'place', 'called', ""'fatass"", 'burger', 'Johnny', '5', 'tragic', 'moment', 'Short', 'Circuit', '2', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'last', 'moments', 'Click', 'having', 'one', 'downer', 'moment', 'otherwise', 'obnoxious', 'wacky', 'comedy', 'really', 'went', 'out', 'point', 'personal', 'opinion', 'one', 'burst', 'hysteria', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'shocking', 'entire', 'performance', 'Precious', 'probably', 'was', 'surprised.Also', 'Kendra', 'C.', 'Johnson', 'actress', ""n't"", 'look', 'bad', 'woman', 'stature']",N/A

Phat Girlz is in many ways similar to Queen Latifah's film LAST HOLIDAY, that had hit the theaters the same year. Both star plus size women as department store clerks with an ambition to be more. In Last Holiday, Latifah wishes to be a master chef. In Phat Girlz, Monique wishes to create high fashion for big girls so that they'll feel more attractive. While Last Holiday had a big enough budget to film in Prague, Monique has to settle for Palm Springs. And in doing so, comes out with the better film. Both films are comic fantasies that provide vicarious thrills for their (assumed) big female audiences. But while Latifah's stunts like skiing and skydiving are visceral adventure, Monique goes through the motions of falling in love--with a man, then herself, then ourselves. The depth of emotion that Mo'nique displays was truly genuine.Yes, some of the comedy is broad; the video cinematography is unsettling almost like they used different types of cameras. Maybe they could have invested a little more. The character development for the supporting players was close to nonexistent. But Monique delivers a film that speaks directly to her fans. Filmmaker Nnegest Likk&eacute; provides counterpoint to the proceedings. The Nigerian doctor is seriously interested in a big girl like Monique because in his culture size is a reflection of wealth. He's intelligent, handsome and even challenges Mo's liberal use of the ""B"" word. The dialogue between the two doctors over who winds up with slender Mia is hilarious.The reality is there are fat people in the world and I guess the writers and Monique just want there place in the world without being hated and mocked all the time. Whether fat is good or bad is not something I am going to comment on and it really is a matter of opinion. There was a time, during the Victorian ages that being fat was good.

That's actually being very kind.  The film is primarily a vehicle for actress/comedian Mo'Nique Imes, better known as just Mo'Nique. I have no doubt that she influenced this film in every way creatively, for better or worse.  She plays the film's protagonist Jazmin, an overweight would-be fashion designer whose awkward attitude about her own weight and resentment to those around her (particularly skinny girls), make for an interesting viewpoint although it does wear out its welcome by the film's conclusion.The internet movie database indicates this film as among its bottom 100.  I don't think that's a fair assessment but the film is definitely not very good.  I hardly think the morality behind Mo'Nique's film was taken into the same consideration by the mobocracy on that site as it is here.  Again, I'm rating this down based primarily on the production quality and the fact that the jokes don't work as often as intended.  The film gains two stars because it means well and has a different voice.",3,I Hate Skinny B*tches Too!,1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,1778,"['Phat', 'Girlz', 'hard', 'film', 'hate', 'genuinely', 'real', 'unique', 'perspective', 'also', 'great', 'task', 'defend', 'being', 'such', 'poor', 'production', 'quality', 'having', 'jokes', 'miss', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'wife', 'informed', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'read', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'suggestion', 'see', 'Phat', 'Girlz', 'review', 'seriously', 'initially', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'sit', 'further', 'consideration', 'wife', 'sat', 'silent', 'horror', 'movie', 'phase', 'owed', 'one', 'Film', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'same', 'level', 'appreciation', 'Besides', ""'ve"", 'always', 'taken', 'pride', 'watching', 'reviewing', 'share', 'notoriously', 'bad', 'films.Anyway', 'Phat', 'Girlz', 'produced', 'directed', 'virtual', 'unknowns', 'sort', 'shows', 'actually', 'being', 'very', 'kind', 'film', 'primarily', 'vehicle', 'actress/comedian', ""Mo'Nique"", 'Imes', 'better', 'known', 'just', ""Mo'Nique"", 'have', 'doubt', 'influenced', 'film', 'way', 'creatively', 'better', 'worse', 'film', 'protagonist', 'Jazmin', 'overweight', 'would-be', 'fashion', 'designer', 'awkward', 'attitude', 'own', 'weight', 'resentment', 'particularly', 'skinny', 'girls', 'make', 'interesting', 'viewpoint', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'film', 'conclusion.The', 'internet', 'movie', 'database', 'film', 'bottom', '100', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fair', 'assessment', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'hardly', 'think', 'morality', ""Mo'Nique"", 'film', 'was', 'taken', 'same', 'consideration', 'mobocracy', 'site', 'here', 'Again', ""'m"", 'rating', 'down', 'based', 'primarily', 'production', 'quality', 'fact', 'jokes', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'often', 'intended', 'film', 'gains', 'two', 'stars', 'well', 'different', 'voice']",N/A

Hinton ""avid reader""","[2, 5]","Mo'nique plays Jazmin Biltmore a hefty woman who thinks her shape is what's preventing her from finding a meaningful relationship. She's been on all kinds of diets and is currently taking Metabo Pills in her efforts to lose weight. Jazmin works in a department store whose plus-size section is severely lacking and she begins making her own clothes because stores don't carry anything attractive in her size.  Her end goal is to show her designs to the head buyer of her store and launch her own clothing line. When she gets shot down for a loan to create her own clothing line, she gets lifted back up by winning a Metabo Pill vacation to a five-star resort with her best friends. There she meets a Nigerian doctor who has no problems with her size, but does have a problem with her self-worth.Overall, Jazmin's story was relatively uplifting though at times it moved too quickly. The end of the movie looked like it was just thrown together and too many plot points were resolved at the last minute. Also, the film quality is pretty poor and at times it looked like this movie was shot with someone's home video camera.Though I found this film fun and amusing, it's definitely borderline R-rating. I wouldn't watch this movie with kids because it has all of the vulgarity and profanity that anyone who knows Mo'nique's work would expect. I thought it was funny, but anyone who wanted something cute to watch with their kids would be in for a rude awakening despite the PG-13 rating.

However, I read some of the previous reviews, and I won't call anybody out or anything, but here's what I gotta say about that. First of all, I just need to say that the person who posted approximately two posts up under mine needs to know that their review is the most hateful, childish, and unintelligent review that I've ever read since I've been on Amazon. I am in utter amazement at how rude and nasty this is towards fat people. None of that was necessary. You wanna talk about hate..It seems like you got a lot of hatred towards fat people. Maybe, it's just fat black people. Clearly, you knew nothing about Monique or her stand-up act as a comedienne before you watched this movie because if you did then you would know that Monique was just being the same Monique as always. Monique just represents big women period..white or black. Second of all, you talk about a big women getting oral sex like that's a bad thing. I don't care whether she was fat or skinny that's never a bad thing. I think you need to grow up because there are tons of men in the world that love themselves a big woman. On top of that, I don't here any complaints when men are getting serviced in that manner, so don't give Monique crap about it. If you don't like fat people, and by the hostility I read in this post it obvious that you don't, then I guess you should've found another movie to watch instead of ""PHAT GIRLZ"". Frankly, everything about this post is totally offensive and you should be ashamed of yourself. With that being said..Is this movie gonna win any Golden Globe or Academy Awards? absolutely not! Is this movie a masterpiece or a major piece of cinema that's gonna impact the world? absolutely not? This movie is just for pure enjoyment and nothing more. It's not meant to antagonize or inspire hatred. It's not black vs white, nor is it fat vs skinny, but it is about accepting yourself no matter what you are. I think that's a message that needs to be heard around the world. Especially, when you have people dying to be thin, by starving themselves, or having a whole lot of uncalled for plastic surgeries. People need to be happy with what they are given instead of trying to look like the celebrities. With that being said, I also have to say that some of the scenes, and some of the language in this movie is kinda strong for a pg-13 rated movie.

What a refreshing change this was and I only wish it had been a bigger box office success so more people had a chance to see it and learn the message in here.Monique wasn't as funny in here as she was in The Parkers, but she was very good.  She plays Jazmin who thinks love is out of her reach because of her size and that it is also holding her back from achieving success in her professional life.  She want's to start a clothing line for full figured women.  She works in Bloomfields where she is constantly discouraged at all the thin girls and the lack of clothing for larger women.  She wins a competition to spend a weekend at a Palms Springs resort with her best friend and cousin and while there, she meets Dr Tunde who is over from Nigeria on business.  He is captivated by her (in Nigeria they say that the bigger the woman, the richer and more beautiful she is).  Because she doesn't yet love herself the way he begins to, she thinks he isn't genuine and believes he lied to her about his whereabouts one night.  On her return to LA, things take a different turn after she gets out of the funk she was in and she starts realising her dream of becoming a designer.  Without spoiling the end, there is a message in here that you must love yourself before anyone else can love you.  On the only negative note, I have to say that while she wants to be loved for who she is, she want's a fine guy and not a nerdy overweight guy herself.This movie didn't make me laugh out loud on a regular basis, although there are funny moments scattered throught the movie, but it's enjoyable for the mere fact that there wasn't any anorexic actress in here.

Jazmin and her co-workers avoid it like the plague for fear of having to sell something from it to a customer. Plus size Jazmin makes her own clothing and always looks ""Fat-tabulous!"" Her dream is having her own clothing line in production and on the curves of other thick women; unfortunately, she can't get to the head buyer of her company and the bank won't give her a loan.Just when she thinks she can't get any more depressed she wins an all expense paid trip to a five star resort in Palm Springs. Jazmin and her best friend, who is also thick, quickly learn that Palm Springs is the stomping ground for the rich skinny butts. Well, not everything... while hanging out by the poolside the three ladies are approached by a visiting doctor named Tunde from Nigeria. Tunde is instantly smitten with Jazmin, much to everyone else's surprise. The ladies are invited to a Nigerian dinner conference where they learn that there are indeed men in the world who know how to treat a lady with curves.Unfortunately, Jazmin isn't used to all this positive energy and can't see the genuine affection. Her own insecurities cause her to self-destruct and she ends up sabotaging her relationship with Tunde, fleeing home to wallow and binge for three days on a bed buffet of junk food. She finally realizes she will never be a size 5 and that she has to start living now. With her new skin of determination she finds the nerve to approach the head buyer and sell her self. Next thing she knows, she's an international success in plus size clothing design in charge of a hot new line of clothing affectionately called ""Thick Madame"" in Tunde's honor. But she still has one major regret she needs to take care of.Phat Girlz is a comedy for sure but there are surprising emotional scenes when Mo'Nique breaks down that I never expected from this comedian. The main theme of this film is the power of kindness and respect. A positive kudos for this film is that Jazmin didn't have to lose weight to find her bliss. A number of great songs including Brick House, So Luscious, and African Queen (I love that song!) keep the movie charged. The film pokes fun at a few stereotypes like the junk food buffet bed mentioned above and again when Jazmin and her friend OVER order at the fast food restaurant but they are bearable.I was resistant to watch Phat Girlz because I have never been a huge Mo'Nique fan despite her fat acceptance popularity but I'm glad I did. Fat chics need more films that highlight their lives and are not all about changing the number on the scale to find happiness and success. It's really a feel good movie. Reviewed by M.E.

The concept is decent but the execution is a clumsy one to say the least.Phat Girlz is about Jazmin(Mo'Nique), a plus sized woman who dreams of owning her own clothing line for plus-sized women. Jazmin, her friend Stacey(Kendra C. Johnson) and her cousin Mia(Joyful Drake) go on a trip. Both Jazmin and Stacey end up meeting the men of their dreams.What I like about the movie: The concept is a decent one. I like the message of the movie about loving yourself no matter your size and weight. I also like the fact that the movie has the ladies hooking up with African men which I find admirable since we hold someone else's standards of beauty in high regard for far too long. Plus it has a few funny moments hence the two stars.What I dislike about the movie: Where do I start? The humor is forced and sometimes the jokes could be spotted 2 miles away. The scene at the burger restaurant where she breaks out into the dozens with the smarmy employee has to be one of the cheesiest scenes in movie history. She was using your mama jokes that I was using back in 1991 when I was in middle school. The messages the movie sends is not bad but the way it sends these messages are flat out corny. Case in point: Jazmin is sassed by a couple of women in a club. She tells them that their insulting her weight because they hate themselves which is true. But she tells them in a Hallmark/Lifetime channel type of way that makes the message hard to take serious. You can convey comments like that without sounding like a person that spent way too much time watching Full House. Everything else that happens after wards is just cheesy including the ending where Jazmin breaks the fourth wall to tell us that we would have to order the sex tape between her and her man.In short Phat Girlz isnt a bad movie but it isnt a good one either. Under better direction and better writing it could have been good.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[5, 5]","I'd never seen this movie before, but while I was flicking through the channels, I stopped to look at an extremely gorgeous African man who played Monique's love interest and just kept on watching to ""mmph"" at him.Pros: I definitely understand why Monique felt a movie like this was necessary. Women are always being ridiculed for not being the perfect size or having the perfect body that is rare in everyday living. As Jim Jones has said in (I believe) ""VIBE"" magazine, Monique has NEVER played herself. She looks excellent in every single thing she puts on, and I give her much respect for dressing to compliment her attributes instead of trying to pull off outfits that just don't work. (Note: Skinny women, medium women, heavyset women ALL do this.) I enjoyed the comedic scenes, especially with her shy friend turned nymphomaniac, and of course, the fellas were gorgeous, especially Monique's.Cons: The acting was awful. When Monique went through the sad and crying scenes, it was like a really amateur afterschool special. I know she meant well, but I wish she'd have taken acting classes or found someone else to play the part because instead of feeling sympathy for her, I was rolling my eyes. I do believe that there are small women who are snide to heavyset women (although I find this attitude more in men than I do in women), but sometimes Monique can be a little TOO hard on small women. Not ALL of them are yapping at the mouth about someone else's size, or maybe that's just been my experience being in the medium range (not the doctor's recommendation but not obese either). Or, maybe more do but I just don't know it. Anyway, there were contradictions within this film. While Monique wants viewers to celebrate heavyset women with the extra weight, in every single movie I see her in, the dudes are always cut up, look like models, and are ideal weights. If Monique really wants to make a point, make her love interest a heavyset man.Other than that, this was a decent film minus a few spots.",2,Good Theme But Bad Acting,1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,2010,"[""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'flicking', 'channels', 'stopped', 'look', 'extremely', 'gorgeous', 'African', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Monique', 'love', 'interest', 'just', 'kept', 'watching', 'mmph', 'him.Pros', 'definitely', 'understand', 'why', 'Monique', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'necessary', 'Women', 'are', 'always', 'being', 'ridiculed', 'not', 'being', 'perfect', 'size', 'having', 'perfect', 'body', 'rare', 'everyday', 'living', 'Jim', 'Jones', 'said', 'believe', 'VIBE', 'magazine', 'Monique', 'NEVER', 'played', 'herself', 'excellent', 'single', 'thing', 'give', 'much', 'respect', 'dressing', 'compliment', 'attributes', 'instead', 'trying', 'pull', 'off', 'outfits', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'Note', 'Skinny', 'women', 'medium', 'women', 'heavyset', 'women', 'do', 'enjoyed', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'especially', 'shy', 'friend', 'turned', 'nymphomaniac', 'course', 'fellas', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'especially', ""Monique's.Cons"", 'acting', 'was', 'awful', 'When', 'Monique', 'went', 'sad', 'crying', 'scenes', 'was', 'really', 'amateur', 'afterschool', 'special', 'know', 'meant', 'well', 'wish', ""'d"", 'have', 'taken', 'acting', 'classes', 'found', 'someone', 'else', 'play', 'part', 'instead', 'feeling', 'sympathy', 'was', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'do', 'believe', 'are', 'small', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'snide', 'heavyset', 'women', 'find', 'attitude', 'more', 'men', 'do', 'women', 'sometimes', 'Monique', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'TOO', 'hard', 'small', 'women', 'Not', 'are', 'yapping', 'mouth', 'someone', 'else', 'size', 'maybe', 'just', 'been', 'experience', 'being', 'medium', 'range', 'not', 'doctor', 'recommendation', 'not', 'obese', 'maybe', 'more', 'do', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Anyway', 'were', 'contradictions', 'film', 'Monique', 'viewers', 'celebrate', 'heavyset', 'women', 'extra', 'weight', 'single', 'movie', 'see', 'dudes', 'are', 'always', 'cut', 'up', 'look', 'models', 'are', 'ideal', 'weights', 'Monique', 'really', 'make', 'point', 'make', 'love', 'interest', 'heavyset', 'man.Other', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'minus', 'few', 'spots']",N/A
