It really does look like 16th century Germany probably should.  The movie is, in my opinion, also a very true portayal of the real Martin Luther.Again, I enjoyed this as a Lutheran and a historian.  However, I imagine that this is not a movie well suited to general viewership.  It delves into heavy theological questions, and challenges the viewer to keep up.  I imagine that a person with little or now knowledge of the late middle ages and its theology will have major problems with this film.  It sort of hurls historical figures at you without ever really introducting them.  We see princes, cardinals, popes, monks, associates of Luther, etc.  They just kind of show up, as if the film makers assume we know who they are and expect them.

829942,A1GPDE0SVI2EUP,B0002C9D9K,"Alan Majeska ""Alan Majeska""","[9, 11]","""Luther"" is an excellent movie in all regards, showing the harshness of life in early 16th century Germany, and how the people had little choice but to obey their rulers and their church.  Freedom of thought was not an issue in 1507-1530, the time span in Martin Luther's life covered in ""Luther"".  Young actor Joseph Fiennes plays Martin Luther (1483-1546), the German monk and priest who began the Protestant Reformation in Germany.The movie starts in 1505, with Martin Luther's experience of conversion during an intense thunderstorm.  Believing he might die and terrified at the lightning and thunder about him, Luther prays to Saint Anne to save him, agreeing to become a monk if his life is spared.  A student of law, Luther joins a monastery and becomes a monk, then a priest.  With great intensity, he works hard, prays, offers confessions that go on for hours, and drives some of his fellow monks crazy with the zeal and intensity of his faith in God.  But Luther is haunted by the issue of how a man is saved, and reads the Epistle of Romans, where his eyes are opened, that ""the just shall live by faith.""  So, he concludes after years or prayer and turmoil, that man is saved by grace: by Christ's death and resurrection, which had happened 1500 years before Luther, and not by good works, or buying indulgences, a common practice of the Roman church in Germany to raise money for a new Cathedral in Rome.Highlights of ""Luther"" :  his first Mass as a priest, in 1507, where Luther is overwhelmed by the solemnity of consecrating the bread and wine, and under the pressure of the moment, bungles things, and offends his father, present at the Mass.  Luther's father had his hopes set on Martin's career as a lawyer, to support him in his old age.  Another highlight is Luther nailing the 95 Theses to the door of Wittenburg Church on October 31, 1517.  These theses, or complaints, largely against the sale of indulgences by the Church as payment for people's sins, were printed in German and distributed to the mass public, without Luther's consent or prior knowledge.Also prevalent are the Peasants' War of 1524-25, which led to the slaughter of some 50,000-100,000 peasants who had risen up against their leaders with the excitement of the new Reformation.  These bloody scenes earned ""Luther"" a PG-13 rating, for violence.There are also some peaceful, touching moments:  Luther's introduction to his future wife, Katherine von Bora, a former nun, and their relationship.The scenery is very beautiful, and the scenes of the Cardinals' conclave in Rome quite impressive.  Peter Ustinov is terrific, as always, as Prince Frederick, who protects Luther and believes in his reforms of the church.  Alfred Molina, Johann Tetzel, a Domician monk, turns in an almost sinister contribution in preaching to the crowds about their need to be saved by purchasing indulgences.  He warns them of their impending doom: to suffer in hell if not buying enough indulgences to save their souls.  This concept was rejected by the Reformers: Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, and others.I can't tell you everything about the movie, but it is very good.  If you like history, or are a student of the Reformation or of Christianity, you will like this.",5,Excellent movie in all regards,1130716800,"10 31, 2005",2005,3235,"['Luther', 'excellent', 'movie', 'regards', 'showing', 'harshness', 'life', 'early', '16th', 'century', 'Germany', 'how', 'people', 'had', 'little', 'choice', 'obey', 'rulers', 'church', 'Freedom', 'thought', 'was', 'not', 'issue', '1507-1530', 'time', 'span', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'life', 'covered', 'Luther', 'Young', 'actor', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Martin', 'Luther', '1483-1546', 'German', 'monk', 'priest', 'who', 'began', 'Protestant', 'Reformation', 'Germany.The', 'movie', '1505', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'experience', 'conversion', 'intense', 'thunderstorm', 'Believing', 'might', 'die', 'terrified', 'lightning', 'thunder', 'Luther', 'Saint', 'Anne', 'save', 'agreeing', 'become', 'monk', 'life', 'spared', 'student', 'law', 'Luther', 'monastery', 'monk', 'then', 'priest', 'great', 'intensity', 'hard', 'prays', 'offers', 'confessions', 'go', 'hours', 'fellow', 'monks', 'crazy', 'zeal', 'intensity', 'faith', 'God', 'Luther', 'haunted', 'issue', 'how', 'man', 'saved', 'Epistle', 'Romans', 'where', 'eyes', 'are', 'opened', 'just', 'shall', 'live', 'faith', 'So', 'years', 'prayer', 'turmoil', 'man', 'saved', 'grace', 'Christ', 'death', 'resurrection', 'had', 'happened', '1500', 'years', 'Luther', 'not', 'good', 'works', 'buying', 'indulgences', 'common', 'practice', 'Roman', 'church', 'Germany', 'raise', 'money', 'new', 'Cathedral', 'Rome.Highlights', 'Luther', 'first', 'Mass', 'priest', '1507', 'where', 'Luther', 'overwhelmed', 'solemnity', 'consecrating', 'bread', 'wine', 'pressure', 'moment', 'bungles', 'things', 'father', 'present', 'Mass', 'Luther', 'father', 'had', 'hopes', 'set', 'Martin', 'career', 'lawyer', 'support', 'old', 'age', 'highlight', 'Luther', 'nailing', '95', 'Theses', 'door', 'Wittenburg', 'Church', 'October', '31', '1517', 'theses', 'complaints', 'largely', 'sale', 'indulgences', 'Church', 'payment', 'people', 'sins', 'were', 'printed', 'German', 'distributed', 'mass', 'public', 'Luther', 'consent', 'prior', 'knowledge.Also', 'prevalent', 'are', 'Peasants', 'War', '1524-25', 'led', 'slaughter', '50,000-100,000', 'peasants', 'who', 'had', 'risen', 'up', 'leaders', 'excitement', 'new', 'Reformation', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'earned', 'Luther', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'are', 'also', 'peaceful', 'touching', 'moments', 'Luther', 'introduction', 'future', 'wife', 'Katherine', 'von', 'Bora', 'former', 'nun', 'relationship.The', 'scenery', 'very', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'Cardinals', 'conclave', 'Rome', 'quite', 'impressive', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'terrific', 'always', 'Prince', 'Frederick', 'who', 'Luther', 'reforms', 'church', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Johann', 'Tetzel', 'Domician', 'monk', 'almost', 'sinister', 'contribution', 'preaching', 'crowds', 'need', 'be', 'saved', 'purchasing', 'indulgences', 'impending', 'doom', 'suffer', 'hell', 'not', 'buying', 'enough', 'indulgences', 'save', 'souls', 'concept', 'was', 'rejected', 'Reformers', 'Luther', 'Calvin', 'Zwingli', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'everything', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'like', 'history', 'are', 'student', 'Reformation', 'Christianity', 'will', 'like']",N/A

Joseph Fiennes is excellent as Luther, and convincingly gives us a portrait of a man who grew in his faith as it was challenged, and became the power that changed the Christian world, and who translated the Bible into language that could be understood by the people, when most (including many of the clergy) were ignorant of scripture.There are some other terrific performances, notably Sir Peter Ustinov, in his last film, as Frederick the Wise, and Bruno Ganz in a sensitive, moving portrayal of Johann von Staupitz, the abbot who was Luther's counselor. Also excellent is Jochen Horst as Andreas Karlstadt, who had a radical approach to the Reformation, and was responsible for much of the violence that occurred.The costuming and sets are remarkable in their feel and look of the era, and the score by Richard Harvey is dramatic and wonderful.With an intelligent script, well paced direction by Eric Till, and beautiful cinematography (shot on location in Germany, Italy, and the Czech Republic) by Robert Fraisse, this film is immensely thought-provoking as well as entertaining, and will be of interest to anyone who enjoys films on Christianity.It certainly should not be viewed as anti-Catholic, but like the Spanish Inquisition, as a telling of one of the dark periods of its history, and amnesia of the past doesn't in any way help the present, and can be a safeguard for the future.The Special Features include interviews with Joseph Fiennes, Sir Peter Ustinov, Claire Cox, and Alfred Molina, and though they are interesting, it's too bad they broke their comments up into little sections.Total running time is 124 minutes.",5,the power of faith and conscience,1104537600,"01 1, 2005",2005,1879,"['A', 'Man', 'Seasons', 'struggle', 'faith', 'conscience', 'riveting', 'viewing', 'brilliant', 'depiction', '16th', 'century', 'life', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'ideas', 'were', 'deemed', 'heretical', 'sparked', 'untold', 'violence', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'excellent', 'Luther', 'convincingly', 'portrait', 'man', 'who', 'grew', 'faith', 'was', 'challenged', 'became', 'power', 'changed', 'Christian', 'world', 'who', 'translated', 'Bible', 'language', 'could', 'be', 'understood', 'people', 'when', 'most', 'including', 'many', 'clergy', 'were', 'ignorant', 'are', 'other', 'terrific', 'performances', 'notably', 'Sir', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'last', 'film', 'Frederick', 'Wise', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'sensitive', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'Johann', 'von', 'Staupitz', 'abbot', 'who', 'was', 'Luther', 'counselor', 'Also', 'excellent', 'Jochen', 'Horst', 'Andreas', 'Karlstadt', 'who', 'had', 'radical', 'approach', 'Reformation', 'was', 'responsible', 'much', 'violence', 'costuming', 'sets', 'are', 'remarkable', 'feel', 'look', 'era', 'score', 'Richard', 'Harvey', 'dramatic', 'wonderful.With', 'intelligent', 'script', 'well', 'paced', 'direction', 'Eric', 'Till', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'shot', 'location', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'Robert', 'Fraisse', 'film', 'immensely', 'thought-provoking', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'will', 'be', 'interest', 'anyone', 'who', 'films', 'Christianity.It', 'certainly', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'viewed', 'anti-Catholic', 'Spanish', 'Inquisition', 'telling', 'one', 'dark', 'periods', 'history', 'amnesia', 'past', ""n't"", 'way', 'help', 'present', 'can', 'be', 'safeguard', 'future.The', 'Special', 'Features', 'include', 'interviews', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Sir', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'Claire', 'Cox', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'are', 'interesting', 'too', 'bad', 'broke', 'comments', 'up', 'little', 'sections.Total', 'running', 'time', '124', 'minutes']",N/A

My pastor has a doctorate in theology and says one of his minors is in Martin Luther history. He really likes Luther and the stand he took against the Catholic church. Although he's not a Luthern preacher, he stated that this movie is about 80% correct. In Hollywood, I feel this is a great score for historical accuracy.I'm a staunch Christian and teach seventh grade history to middle school students. While watching this movie, I immediately wanted to show this superb show to my students. It was awesome. I could feel the schism between the reformers and the Catholic church as I listened to the musical score. There are chanting voices that are at war with eerieness. The costumes were rich with beauty and authenticity. The acting was full of emotion and each character served a purpose in furthering the plot and gaining the audience's heart.I really couldn't find fault in this movie. If anything, I wanted to see more film footage on the DVD extras. I now believe I'll buy the movie soundtrack and have students use the score for their Power Point presentations. Christians need to buy this movie and show it to their children and families. We live in a country that forgets about how hard it was to gain our Christian freedoms and Luther was the first to protest tyranny. God has used this historical figure to change the world and make it a better place.The scenerary, camera angles, story, and dialogue were powerful and moving to my heart. I've always been fond of the movie Braveheart, and after seeing Luther, I found even more emotion for this world-changer. It's hard to capture the life of one giant in two hours, but this movie excels in bringing Martin Luther to the hearts and minds of the twenty-first century. I know people should study more of their heritage, but most won't do it. Yet this movie might make them more aware of the impact Luther had on the world and dig deeper into their history books.The sound mixers did a wonderful job of pounding the hammer noise into my ears as Luther posted his list of grievances against the Catholic church.My major disappointment is not against this DVD, but I now wish I had known about Luther when it came out in theaters.

829946,AHY9EY9HGQTP6,B0002C9D9K,Andrew Freborg,"[10, 11]","A very powerful film that remains faithful to Luther's Christian message of salvation by faith through grace. Wonderfully crafted and emotionally gripping -- the vignettes of connecting the Gospel to the ordinary German people of the time (the crippled child, grieving parents), and how the powers at the time corrupted and usurpted the Christian message are esp. striking(and hold true for today as well).  I think it serves as an important ""upshort"" to all organized religion to remain fiathful to the core message of Christ. The film also I think marks an important milestone for Hollywood -- a Chrisitian religious film uncorrupted by revisionism. You will feel uplifted after watching this - the ultimate message being you have nothing to fear from any man when you stand with God's word. The Augsburg Confession scene at the end will have you cheering, and thanking God for the courage of these people during the Reformation.Would have been a ""5 Star"" rating except for a few very surprising deficiencies:1 - The film and soundtrack completely omit Luther's signature hymnn ""Ein Feste Burg"", and pay short shrift to his hymns in general -- whats with that? The German language version of the DVD has a special feature with chorals featuring ""Ein Feste Burg"" --- why can't we Americans have this?2 - I think an ""extended version"" would be nice -- with more story exploring his theology and efforts at translating the Bible into German. Also would have liked to see more of Erfurt, Wittenburg, Worms and Augsburg.3 - His relationship with wife Katarina von Bora is well done, but also given short shrift.

Few serious directors have taken on the topic of Christian history since ""The Ten Commandments."" I left the theater better informed about Martin Luther and the Reformation.Although important parts of Luther's life, positions and views are glazed over or ignored, it serves to incite curiosity about his 95 Theses and the Augsburg Confession.The difficulty with a film portrayal of one of Christian history's more influential figures is that the historical Martin Luther could not be captured into a couple of hours. It is just a movie, and is not supposed to address complex eternal questions.Protestant Christians will bristle at the brief look at Luther's theology, and the emphasis on the politics. What else could a filmmaker do? Already, such a film was destined for a short life in the theaters, and the fact is true: much of the issues surrounding Luther stemmed from his reaction to politics.Roman Catholics might be upset by the anti-Catholic slant. I do not think the film was meant to put Catholicism in a bad light as much as it was meant to show what events and concerns caused Luther to react. The movie was aptly titled ""Luther"" and not ""The Beginning of the Reformation"" or ""The Great Religious Revolt.""Indulgences have never been one of Catholicism's honorable or defensible provisions. There is no telling of Luther's story without examining the abuses of men looking to profit from the fear and guilt of illiterate believers. A modern Catholic will rightly note that personal Scripture among the laity is now encouraged by Rome, and be frustrated as he acknowledges indulgences are still part of the present Catholic theology.Lutherans will find the movie intriguing, realizing Luther's battle against Rome begot their own denomination. Coming back to the origin of the Lutheran faith will be exciting and educational.Joseph Fiennes is believable, albeit a little wooden. His Luther will remind viewers of Jeremy Irons' character in ""The Mission."" He is noble, calm and steadfast. Like Irons' priest, Luther faces great adversity through his desire to follow Jesus Christ.Luther comes across as a noble would-be martyr. He shows godly courage, and a few levels of depth. What is not shown are his own imperfections and inconsistencies.When Luther writhes in angst against temptation and evil, he speaks angrily to Satan as would anyone to his most cursed enemy. Like C. S. Lewis' Wormwood in ""The Screwtape Letters,"" we can taste the insidious, pervasive nature of Satan. The spiritual conflict endured by Luther is not the glamorized head-spinning of ""The Exorcist,"" but shows that he was not merely fighting flesh and blood entities through academic arguments.My recommendation of ""Luther"" is 100%. Sunday school, CCD and high school groups could watch it as fodder for discussion. This isn't for the ""Adventures In Odyssey"" or ""Veggie Tales"" crowd.A solid companion to the movie is ""Here I Stand: A Life of Martin Luther"" by Roland Herbert Bainton.

It depicts the rise of Luther from the disenchanted Catholic monk of his early years to the epoch-forming, paradigm-shifting reformer that he would later become. I thought it did a good job of depicting the time period and outlining the major points of Luther's life. My previous knowledge of Luther when I saw the film several years ago consisted of generalities only, and watching it helped me to learn more about him. The early scenes, which convincingly depict the formative experiences that would eventually lead to his later revolutionary ideas, were particularly enlightening. It also inspired me to research his life further after viewing it. In doing so, I discovered that the movie was generally historically accurate - although not 100% so, as it did err on a  few points, mostly minor, in addition to engaging in the overly quick, corner-cutting style of presentation that is inevitable in any Hollywood adaptation of an eventful life. I found the acting, by Joseph Fiennes as well as the rest of the cast, to be of an overall high quality.I did have some problems with the film, though. First and foremost, the movie suffers from an overly intense anti-Catholic bias. This was clear to me, despite the fact that I am neither a Catholic nor a Protestant and actually agree with several of the reforms that Luther pioneered; the movie depicts all Catholics as if they were evil incarnate, which serves to negate its pretensions toward objectivity. Also, several loose plot ends were left dangling at the end of the movie; indeed, the last quarter or so felt rushed, and the ending was somewhat abrupt. Still, despite these flaws, I enjoyed the movie overall and was pleasantly surprised by it, as I had low initial expectations as to its quality.",3,Enjoyable but Imperfect,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,1893,"['recently', 'viewed', 'film', 'Luther', 'generally', 'enjoyed', 'finding', 'worthwhile', 'experience', 'do', 'have', 'qualms', 'rise', 'Luther', 'disenchanted', 'Catholic', 'monk', 'early', 'years', 'epoch-forming', 'paradigm-shifting', 'reformer', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'thought', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'depicting', 'time', 'period', 'outlining', 'major', 'points', 'Luther', 'life', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'Luther', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'consisted', 'generalities', 'only', 'watching', 'helped', 'learn', 'more', 'early', 'scenes', 'convincingly', 'depict', 'formative', 'experiences', 'would', 'eventually', 'lead', 'later', 'revolutionary', 'ideas', 'were', 'particularly', 'enlightening', 'also', 'inspired', 'research', 'life', 'further', 'viewing', 'doing', 'so', 'discovered', 'movie', 'was', 'generally', 'historically', 'accurate', 'not', '100', '%', 'so', 'did', 'err', 'few', 'points', 'mostly', 'minor', 'addition', 'engaging', 'overly', 'quick', 'corner-cutting', 'style', 'presentation', 'inevitable', 'Hollywood', 'adaptation', 'eventful', 'life', 'found', 'acting', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'be', 'overall', 'high', 'quality.I', 'did', 'have', 'problems', 'film', 'though', 'First', 'foremost', 'movie', 'suffers', 'overly', 'intense', 'anti-Catholic', 'bias', 'was', 'clear', 'fact', 'am', 'neither', 'Catholic', 'Protestant', 'actually', 'agree', 'several', 'reforms', 'Luther', 'pioneered', 'movie', 'Catholics', 'were', 'evil', 'incarnate', 'negate', 'pretensions', 'objectivity', 'Also', 'several', 'loose', 'plot', 'ends', 'were', 'left', 'dangling', 'end', 'movie', 'indeed', 'last', 'quarter', 'so', 'felt', 'rushed', 'ending', 'was', 'somewhat', 'abrupt', 'Still', 'flaws', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'overall', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'had', 'low', 'initial', 'expectations', 'quality']",N/A

Joseph Fiennes was fantastic in the title role, also Alfred Molina (indulgence huckster, Johann Tetzel) and of course, the late Sir Peter Ustinov (elector of Saxony and Luther's protector, Frederick the Wise) put in great performances.Critics complain this movie overlooked much of Luther's shortcomings. It did to a degree. After all the project was backed by Thrivent, a major Lutheran financial service. So you didn't get to hear of the Father of the Protestant Reformation's scatalogical fixations, or his eventual anti-semitism, or of his contempt for the peasantry (although, to be fair, he condemned those peasants who were the followers of anarchic Anabaptism). Regardless, this film was much better than any ""historically based"" or ""period piece"" flick Hollywood has put out for awhile. Unlike that garbage, this film actually attempts to inform as well as entertain the viewer. Of course, there is some toying with the historical facts: Jochen Horst portrays the theologian, Andreas Karlstadt as a rabid, levelling fanatic. In reality, Karlstadt was an advocate for nonviolence, refusing to have anything to do with the likes of militant radicals such as Thomas Muntzer (with whom the film's ""Karlstadt"" seems to have much more in common).As for some calling this movie anti-Catholic, this is simply not true.

B Collins Jr.,"[2, 4]","The complexity of the Reformation is often hard to capture in a single film but this film on the life of Martin Luther does a very good job of introducing viewers to the issues while telling a compelling story of a brilliant inspired man who changed world history.Luther was a combination of a rebellious spirit, a brilliant mind, and a strong personality able to confront persons of much greater power and prestige. These attributes combined with his religious devotion, clear understanding of the essence of the New Testament, and ability to sort the message of Christ from the crippling dogma of Renaissance Roman Catholicism helped direct his destiny. All of this plus a strong sense of social justice are all factors in the unique man that was Martin Luther.It is important to note that the Reformation occurs at a point when Roman Catholicism had grown corrupt and despite the horrors of the 30 years war and other Protestant versus Catholic conflicts, Catholicism was eventually strengthened by the external critics and forces that eventually resulted in reform within the church.The film makes it clear that religious reformation also was connected to political considerations and the forces of nationalism also. The English and German churches split away from the Italian centered Roman Catholics on issues of both faith and dogma but also along the lines of emerging nationalism.Joseph Fiennes does a fine job as Luther, a man sometimes tortured by self-doubt and concern that the devil directed his rebellious spirit. Jonathan Firth is excellent as the bright envoy of the Pope, sent to quell the influence of Luther. Alfred Molina gives a strong performance as a priest who uses emotionalism and fear to derived funds from the poor. However, the performance of Sir Peter Ustinov as King Frederick the Wise of Saxony was absolutely wonderful. Ustinov's last performance on film is superb. His comic timing and excellent delivery is a treat for the viewer.There are those who may think that too much was squeezed into this film. They are probably correct. There are those who think the film is anti-Catholic.

""Luther"" has nothing, other than the expectation that you will only watch this film if you are a Lutheran, and thus are willing to sit through a whitewashing. While I was originally anxious to watch this film because of my interest in history, I quickly came to realize that the Lutherans see their leader as one who changed history with a warm heart.  However, the Luther I know from my readings was one who had heated disputes with the spirits and who had a great disdain for all things female.  None of that is seen here, and so the movie becomes yet another failed religious movie.  I did, however, find some good in the film.  The costumes and set designs are first rate.  I also enjoyed watching Luther use the Catholic Church's own policies against them.  Forbidding people to read the Bible in different languages was bound to catch up with them eventually.  I also will always respect Luther for starting one of the most successful non-violent revolutions in history.  Of course, all revolutions involve some violence, but his was never based on it.  It's just a shame this film, paid for by Lutherans, wouldn't admit that their hero wasn't perfect (none of mine are).

It probably was made more to make the Roman Catholic church look bad, or to glorify a rebel and a man of the people: ""the peoples' liberation"" as the back cover of the DVD states.Whateverthe motive, it stays true to history and it's nice to see that for a change. To those unfamiliar with Luther, he was the founder of the Protestant denomination. Luther was a monk who saw and heard things he thought were unscriptural and broke off from the Catholic Church in ""protest."" Hence, the ""Protestant"" church was formed.Anyway, not only was the story done well, so was the cinematography. This is one gorgeous movie to ogle, well-filmed with high production values. The scenery, sets and costumes are all first-rate.Joseph Fiennes (Luther) is a bit wimpy-looking but his character certainly isn't. As the subject of indulgences and other practices begin to transform Luther's ideas of what Jesus' church should be, the story grows in intensity as Luther gets pressured by the Catholic hierarchy as his protest issues become public.What happens to him and to the masses because of his actions are revealed in pretty dramatic form. Obviously the story is far more complex than two hours can give it but the filmmakers did a pretty good job condensing it to make the time constriction.Notes: This was Peter Ustinov's last movie.

Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[16, 20]","Eric Till's 2003 bio-pic ""Luther,"" starring Joseph Fiennes as the title character, offers the epic-hungry viewer much of what he craves: big, big struggles: Man against God, Man against Man, Light against Darkness, discussed in an intelligent script set against a vividly rich and slightly exotic locale: late Medieval-Early Renaissance, Mitteleuropa.Epic fans will be reminded of such favorites as David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""A Man for All Seasons,"" about St. Thomas More, and Mervyn LeRoy's ""Quo Vadis.""Joseph Fiennes makes a perfect cinematic Luther. As I watched Fiennes / Luther writhing in violent struggle with a real or imaginary Satan, as I gazed into Fiennes' huge, exquisitely expressive eyes, I thought, ""Hmm, who is he reminding me of?"" At first I thought of his more famous older brother Ralph Fiennes, star of the somewhat-epic ""The English Patient,"" but then I realized, no, no, Fiennes' Luther is reminding me very much of Peter O'Toole's Lawrence of Arabia, and that's a very good thing.Like O'Toole, Fiennes is charismatic, fascinating, and highly watchable. Like O'Toole's Lawrence, Fiennes' Luther is a man who is like you and me and yet not, an average guy destined to a rarified calling. Like us, he is offended by hypocrisy, but, unlike us, his character demands that he take action. He behaves in ways that some find heroic, and that others find insanely risky. Thus, he is thrust out ahead of the crowd, and becomes, inevitably, alone.Bruno Ganz is wonderful as Johann von Staupitz, Luther's confessor and mentor. Ganz's face looks like a handful of uncooked bread dough. He is one hundred percent convincing, whether depicting compassion, as he guides Luther, or agony, as he lets his protegee go. You wish you had your own Johann von Staupitz.The great Sir Peter Ustinov appears here as Frederick the Wise, Ustinov's final theatrical film role. Frederick is a very wealthy ruler. He has collected a peerless museum of holy relics: this saint's arm, that saint's skull, etc. Luther preached against relics, and yet Frederick became Luther's protector. Ustinov portrays Frederick as an aging and yet still sly old fox -  not as quick as he once might have been, but, if somewhat creaky, just as crafty. Film fans will compare this final role by Ustinov with one of his first, as a very different ruler, the Christian-murdering Nero, in 1951's ""Quo Vadis.""Alfred Molina, playing the bad guy yet again, is superb in vivid scenes that depict exactly how the Catholic Church convinced the faithful to part with their money to build St. Peter's, the very St. Peter's in Rome that we are all familiar with today. Molina describes the tortures of hell that their loved ones are suffering; ""Coin in the coffer rings; a soul from Purgatory springs,"" he says, in an actual quote from the character he is playing.The conflicts these actors portray all seem very real and very immediate. It is clear that Luther is risking his own life, and the lives of thousands of others, with every word he speaks and writes. The viewer does get the sense that what is happening here is something that matters very much.""Luther"" is a feast for the eyes. It was filmed on 100 sets in 20 locations throughout Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic, and all that is very visible, and beautifully photographed, onscreen. The costumes are especially rich. Late medieval-early renaissance velvets, pearls, ermines, and peasants' rags practically invite your hand to reach out and touch them.""Luther"" has its flaws. Joseph Fiennes' Luther is a sweetheart who wouldn't hurt a fly. The Luther who has come down to us in his own writings, however, is notoriously abrasive. Luther used much scatological language. The relation between his writing and the deaths of tens of thousands in the Peasants' War is addressed by the film, but not dwelled upon. Luther approved of the burning of witches. Much attention has been brought, lately, to Luther's intemperate words about Jews. That Luther is not depicted here.There's a lot of history in ""Luther,"" and some very big ideas are addressed. Is it always benign to question authority? How do people who have been oppressed behave when the lid is lifted? What are the dangers of freedom, and of a ""Let's wipe the slate clean"" mentality? One brief scene attempts to address all these questions: Luther's former teacher, a man who used to uphold Catholic doctrine, now suddenly converted to what he sees as Luther's cause, humiliates a young priest for wearing a crucifix, and recommends that churches be destroyed. Will the average viewer understand the import of such a brief scene exploring such huge issues?Similarly, Luther's romance with a nun who escaped her convent in a herring barrel is given very short shrift. And, Luther was one crest on a wave, not the entire movement. Jan Hus, for example, deserves more prominent mention.To fully address these themes, the movie could have easily been an hour longer. What is here is very good and very exciting, though. This film deserves a much wider audience than it is has had so far.",5,"An Exciting, Intelligent, and Visually Beautiful Epic",1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,5078,"['Eric', 'Till', '2003', 'bio-pic',

Very inspiring as well as entertaining.  This has become one my new favorites and I consider it recommended viewing - worth the price of purchase.I do agree, however, with a previous reviewer who made note of the fact that the 1953 movie, Martin Luther, staring Niall Macginnis - was a bit warmer and gave more insight into the conflict between the teachings of the Roman Catholic religion and Luther's revelation and embracing of Scripture.  Though not quite as visually spectacular, the story is played out a bit better and the characters are a bit more believable and emotionally compelling.  Personally, I liked the original movie's Luther character a bit better.  The old black and white film is, for certain, a quality classic.That having been said, this newer movie is not without its merits.  Joseph Fiennes did a fantastic job as a young Luther.  I really like this actor and was pleased he was given the role.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and, as I stated previously, am proud to consider it among my new list of favorite films.  The cinematography and special effects are beautiful and the story is compelling though a bit rushed.I personally felt it raced through some very important events in Luther's life without giving a clear sense of time.  In other words, in the flash of a scene, a spans of years had passed and the viewer is left wondering when all these changes took place.  One minute Luther is struggling with his faith in the Roman Catholic Church and then, it seems, suddenly he is preaching against it and ridiculing it.  I don't think there was quite enough character development made (perhaps this rushing through scenes is why I get that feeling) as you don't fully become emotionally attached to the character of Luther, let alone his message.  There are, however, some touching scenes that are well performed and that keep the viewer engaged in the plot.I think if one is already familiar with Luther's history and the message he preached, the other aspects of the film's inadequacies will not be a distraction... and there is still much inspiration to glean from this film.  There are some great, memorable lines and, despite its minor flaws, the film has a great flow and feel to it.

I finally rented it, and got the opportunity to view it.I liked it. For what it was, it was a great movie, showing Martin Luther's passion for Christ, and his relentless quest for sharing the Truth with the people.However, I wrote to my church pastor, with concerns about the historical accuracy of this film; I will let his own words speak for him;""The film has some minor issues.  In one scene while he is preaching, his students are all seated as we would be today in our churches.  The historical problem is that people would always stand in honor of the Word when anyone was preaching.  As for the story of his life it is accurate as far as it goes.  There is much that they had to leave out.  Unfortunately, one of Luther's blind spots was a fairly severe anti-Semitism that the film does not address.  It does, however, capture his passion for God and what it does report of his life is true of him.  There is just too much about Luther to fit into a 2 hour film.  It is well filmed and acted.  I took our Youth Group to see it and felt they left with a good snapshot of what Luther was really all about.""I myself am not anti-Semetic. I did however love how Luther's burning passion for God and the Word was portrayed. I admired how one man stood up to the church for what he strongly believed in. I was born and raised Catholic. But, the Catholic Church throughout history, even today, was corrupt in some form or another. Nothing against the Holy Church; certain people in a position of power have a bad habit of perverting God's Word, and giving the church a bad name. And this film shows one man's courage to defy the perversions and corrptness of the church, and bring the truth back to the people.I hardly feel it to be right to compare this movie with ""The Passion of the Christ"". To set the record straight, Mel Gibson is not anti-Semetic. ""The Passion"" had raised controversial issues of anti-Semetism, all of which are not true. ""The Passion"" is the most powerful, and the most accurate portrayal of the final hours in the life of Jesus Christ. I felt Gibson followed the four Gospels in creating an accurate portrayal. I, myself, left the theater feeling that He had died for my sins; it was my sins that nailed Him to the cross, not the Jews or the Romans.You cannot compare ""Luther"" to ""The Passion"". There really is no comparison.As a film, ""Luther"" was very good, and I hope that the quote I used from my own church pastor has helped shed a little light on the hisorical background not shown in the movie.God bless",5,"Luther was anti-Semetic, yet had a burning passion for God",1102464000,"12 8, 2004",2004,2636,"['do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Luther', 'got', 'enough', 'public', 'attention', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'theater', 'finally', 'rented', 'got', 'opportunity', 'view', 'it.I', 'liked', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'showing', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'passion', 'Christ', 'relentless', 'quest', 'sharing', 'Truth', 'people.However', 'wrote', 'church', 'pastor', 'concerns', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'will', 'let', 'own', 'words', 'speak', 'film', 'minor', 'issues', 'one', 'scene', 'preaching', 'students', 'are', 'all', 'seated', 'would', 'be', 'today', 'churches', 'historical', 'problem', 'people', 'would', 'always', 'stand', 'honor', 'Word', 'when', 'anyone', 'was', 'preaching', 'story', 'life', 'accurate', 'as', 'far', 'much', 'had', 'leave', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'Luther', 'blind', 'spots', 'was', 'fairly', 'severe', 'anti-Semitism', 'film', 'not', 'address', 'however', 'capture', 'passion', 'God', 'what', 'report', 'life', 'true', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'Luther', 'fit', '2', 'hour', 'film', 'well', 'filmed', 'acted', 'took', 'Youth', 'Group', 'see', 'felt', 'left', 'good', 'snapshot', 'what', 'Luther', 'was', 'really', 'am', 'not', 'anti-Semetic', 'did', 'however', 'love', 'how', 'Luther', 'burning', 'passion', 'God', 'Word', 'was', 'portrayed', 'admired', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'stood', 'up', 'church', 'what', 'strongly', 'believed', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'Catholic', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'history', 'even', 'today', 'was', 'corrupt', 'form', 'Nothing', 'Holy', 'Church', 'certain', 'people', 'position', 'power', 'have', 'bad', 'habit', 'perverting', 'God', 'Word', 'giving', 'church', 'bad', 'name', 'film', 'one', 'man', 'courage', 'defy', 'perversions', 'corrptness', 'church', 'bring', 'truth', 'back', 'people.I', 'hardly', 'feel', 'be', 'right', 'compare', 'movie', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'not', 'anti-Semetic', 'Passion', 'had', 'raised', 'controversial', 'issues', 'anti-Semetism', 'are', 'not', 'true', 'Passion', 'most', 'powerful', 'most', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'final', 'hours', 'life', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'felt', 'Gibson', 'followed', 'four', 'Gospels', 'creating', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'left', 'theater', 'feeling', 'had', 'died', 'sins', 'was', 'sins', 'nailed', 'Him', 'cross', 'not', 'Jews', 'Romans.You', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'Luther', 'Passion', 'really', 'comparison.As', 'film', 'Luther', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'hope', 'quote', 'used', 'own', 'church', 'pastor', 'helped', 'shed', 'little', 'light', 'hisorical', 'background', 'not', 'shown', 'movie.God', 'bless']",N/A

I suspect that such a goal would have to comprise two very long movies.  Still, Director Eric Till aptly presents us with an overall view of this monk who revolutionized the Christian world both theologically---and politically.  Joseph Fiennes portrays Luther as a man who was not intentionally trying to be a religious revolutionary.  He was primarily upset with the Catholic Church's peculiar notions concerning indulgences.  What started out as a somewhat minor disagreement eventually turned into a breach that could not be resolved.  Luther may very well be indeed best described as an accidental revolutionary.  There is a very accurate scene where a follower of Luther has his writings mass produced via the newly created Gutenberg printing press.  Martin Luther would have almost certainly been a very minor historical figure without this ability to spread his ideas to the masses.  Did Luther support all of the changes that he may have unwittingly initiated?  Regretfully,  revolutions have a way of sometimes encouraging excessive behavior.  Luther was not ready for all of the changes that were made his name.  There is also ample evidence to suggest that he could have cared less about advancing liberal democracy.  Luther possessed an authoritarian personality and would be the last person to argue for the separation of church and state.  He was not a Forrest Gump character, but Luther also did not set out to change our lives forevermore.Martin Luther was also a vicious anti-Semite and likely spent his final years as an out of control alcoholic.  Vulgar language and scatological utterances were not foreign to him.  Luther was definitely not a saint.  This movie ignores these unpleasant facts.  Yet,  this interpretation of Luther earns four and a half stars.  There's enough here to make it worth your while.

829980,A8N5EM32PVLZJ,B0002C9D9K,Dean A. Anderson,"[3, 5]","Would we die for our faith? Many of us hope that if ever such a circumstance came about, we would be willing to die for Christ.  Would we kill for our faith?  Most of us assume that, outside of radical Islam, any person of faith would answer, ""Certainly not"".The film Luther (released in 2004, just out on DVD) takes place during an age when almost all in the Christian church would answer that second question affirmatively. Martin Luther was born in a time (1483) when the Roman Catholic church was the only church in Europe. The clergy of the time was often corrupt, the Bible was only translated into Latin, and it was widely believed that salvation was something to be earned.Last year seemed to be the year of the bio-pic (Ray, The Aviator, Hotel Rwanda, Kinsey, Finding Neverland, and more). Among these films, Luther, is rather pedestrian in its storytelling. It does not have the high powered cast and acting turns of the films mentioned earlier, but it is worth seeing because of the man whose story it tells.The film provides a good biographical sketch of the man who arguably did as much to spread the gospel as any person since the New Testament was completed. It follows Martin (played in the film by Joseph Fiennes, who played Will in Shakespeare in Love) from his seemingly rash decision to become a monk, through his theological wrestling to understand salvation, through his battles with the church, through the peasant revolts, to his marriage to a runaway nun, Katherine von Bora. The movie also includes Luther interacting at times with composite and imagined characters for dramatic effect (at times not convincingly.)Luther has long been one of my heroes because of two amazing things he did. First, during a time it was believed that salvation could be gained for one's self and loved ones by giving money to the church, he brought back to ordinary men and women the gospel, that we are saved not by works but by faith in the work of Christ Jesus. (People at this time could not read Ephesians 2:8 & 9 for themselves.)  I loved in the film being able to see Luther make his stand at what was called the Diet of Worms. His speech at this time was brilliant and brave (and provided the title for Roland Bainton's wonderful Luther biography Here I Am.)Secondly, he translated the New Testament into common German, arguably the greatest breakthrough for the Bible getting into all vernaculars, and encouraging reading in an illiterate world. And another thing I love about Luther is his marriage to Katie. One of the great romances of history, their story alone would make for a great movie.Luther bravely faced the possibility of death for standing up for his faith. In the film, we see followers of Luther's teaching die horribly for their beliefs. What the film (sponsored primarily by a Lutheran financial group) does not portray is Luther's anti-Semitism or his belief that those he believed to be heretics (such as Anabaptists, practitioners in Believer's Baptism exclusively and not infant baptism) should be executed if they did not repent.At this time, most everyone believed that matters of faith were life and death matters. And in this they were right. Not that I am advocating crusades. Evangelism by execution has not been proved effective by history. But we must understand that at the time, the plague was still a great danger. The memory of a third of the population of Europe being destroyed in a five year span was fresh. And many people of the time understood that life on earth was fleeting and what really mattered in life was preparing oneself for eternity.In our time, we often do not take points of theology and faith very seriously. You have your beliefs, I'll have mine. But Jesus said in Matthew 18:6 ""But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believes in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.""  Paul referred to false teachers in Acts 20:29 as savage wolves.People of Luther's time were correct that points of faith and theology, particularly how one can be right with God, are the most vital issues of life. But they were not following Christ's call to love and pray for their enemies.The Roman Catholic church's inquisition and the heinous acts of many of the Reformers were horrible distortions of the Gospel and a stain on the Church. But our oblivious attitudes toward the eternal destiny of others may be as great a stain upon the church of our day as we approach God's throne.Another man of the time's story, Sir Thomas More, is also worthy of your time. An Englishman who supported the early work of Luther, he turned against him when Luther was excommunicated by the Catholic church in 1520. More's opposition to Henry VIIIs founding of the Anglican church led to More's execution. A Man for All Seasons was first a stage play by Robert Bolt. It was made into an excellent Oscar winning film in 1966 with Paul Scofield as More.

I saw the film when it was originally released, and have waited patiently for it to arrive on DVD. Luckily my wife gave it to me for Christmas. Luther is a film which I think all Christians should see - mainly because it could generate a lot of ""deep"" discussion about what happened to cause the reformation. In my humble opinion, both the Protestant and Catholic Church could learn a lot from this era of its history.Overall, I think this movie is well done, and does a decent job of portraying the state of the Church which caused Luther to question some of its fundamental doctines. Some of the dialogue is not the best, and the historical accuracy of the film is questionable in certain scenes, but I do think that the seriousness of what transpired is clearly communicated to the viewer. Luther started a movement which really changed the face of Europe, for better or worse, and some would argue is still going on today.Two other things I liked about the movie are the sets and costumes. Having lived in Germany for almost four years I really appreciate the effort made to transport the viewer to 16th Century Germany. It really added an element of authenticity to the film.I highly recommend this movie to all Christians, or those interested in European reformation history. While I would not consider the film historically precise (many have already pointed out that Luther's flaws are not addressed at all), hopefully it will generate more interest in this very important era of history, especially for the Body of Christ.",4,"Movie worthy of attention, especially by Christians",1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,1659,"['am', 'encouraged', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'reviews', 'movie', 'given', 'limited', 'attention', 'received', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'have', 'waited', 'patiently', 'arrive', 'DVD', 'Luckily', 'wife', 'gave', 'Christmas', 'Luther', 'film', 'think', 'Christians', 'should', 'see', 'mainly', 'could', 'generate', 'lot', 'deep', 'discussion', 'what', 'happened', 'cause', 'reformation', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Protestant', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'era', 'history.Overall', 'think', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'decent', 'job', 'portraying', 'state', 'Church', 'caused', 'Luther', 'question', 'fundamental', 'doctines', 'dialogue', 'not', 'best', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'questionable', 'certain', 'scenes', 'do', 'think', 'seriousness', 'what', 'transpired', 'clearly', 'communicated', 'viewer', 'Luther', 'started', 'movement', 'really', 'changed', 'face', 'Europe', 'better', 'worse', 'would', 'argue', 'still', 'going', 'today.Two', 'other', 'things', 'liked', 'movie', 'are', 'sets', 'costumes', 'Having', 'lived', 'Germany', 'almost', 'four', 'years', 'really', 'appreciate', 'effort', 'made', 'transport', 'viewer', '16th', 'Century', 'Germany', 'really', 'added', 'element', 'authenticity', 'film.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Christians', 'interested', 'European', 'reformation', 'history', 'would', 'not', 'consider', 'film', 'historically', 'precise', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'Luther', 'flaws', 'are', 'not', 'addressed', 'hopefully', 'will', 'generate', 'more', 'interest', 'very', 'important', 'era', 'history', 'especially', 'Body', 'Christ']",N/A

829987,A1W0PUJUZ9IMZU,B0002C9D9K,Dr. W,"[46, 51]","On the positive side, this film tells a straightforward story about Luther's ideas and the issues those ideas raised for 16th Century European political affairs.  It amply displays his belief in the importance of scripture and the ""priesthood of all believers,"" and by implication it shows his idea that salvation should be achieved by faith alone.  It hits the major events from his epiphany in the thunderstorm up through the onset of the peasant's revolt and the challenge of the German princes to the rule of Emperor Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire.  As such, it nicely combines both religious and political issues that couldn't be separated during Luther's time either (in other words, it does not simply focus on Luther himself or on religious beliefs).I didn't find the film to be overly anti-Catholic, although the nature of the subject matter could give that impression.At the same time, the film is rather bland, and perhaps it could have benefitted from some perspective or other emphasis.It also could have gone further in showing the implications of Luther's Reformation; it seems to just stop once the Emperor realizes he's going to have trouble from the German princes, without discussing or even mentioning the ensuing religious and political crises that rocked Europe through the end of the Thirty Years War in 1648, when statecraft and national interest finally became a more consistent influence than religion in determining the course of European political development.Further, the film does not explore WHY or HOW Luther became so profoundly changed, nor does it adequately explain why the German princes might have embraced Luther's ideas in their own political fight against the Holy Roman Emperor. Luther's character seems to waver between tormented soul and self-confident professor; the film doesn't explain these dramatic swings, and it feels as if we never quite get to know who Luther was.  He is portrayed by Joseph Fiennes as displaying a significant amount of doubt, which both contributes to this feeling of inconsistency as well as shows the internal as well as external struggle Luther must have undergone in fighting for his beliefs (which surely he felt to be not so much his beliefs but the only true belief).  In that way, this film does try to understand and portray Luther as more than a cardboard character, as a real person and not a historical icon; his performance suggests, as all good history should, that people are full of contradictory impulses, and that events could have turned out differently than they did.The film, therefore, shows a human, rather than a religious, character, and it leaves much to the viewer to decide about Luther; it's not religious propaganda, even though it is sympathetic to Luther.  A rather sappy subplot about a crippled child is used in the film to exhibit Luther's compassion, but I wonder if it is a transparent attempt to draw in viewers, or if Luther was known to exhibit such personal interest.In some ways, the PBS Empires documentary Martin Luther packs more emotional and intellectual punch, and is often more powerfully directed and filmed than this feature film; those looking for a deeper, more incisive account which still includes a dramatic visual and emotional component should look there, too.The special features on this DVD are minimal (cast interviews) and mostly irrelevant to the types of religious and historical questions that the film raises (so in that sense, the special features are no different than most DVDs).This film is easily accessible to a teenage audience.Despite the drawbacks, the film is a welcome replacement for various older accounts that collect dust on school shelves due to their slow storytelling or antiquated sensibility; this film is bright, lively, and visually compelling.  On the whole, its simplicity makes it great for those interested in learning about or seeing a dramatization of the major events of Luther's Reformation.",3,here it stands,1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,3963,"['positive', 'side', 'film', 'straightforward', 'story', 'Luther', 'ideas', 'issues', 'ideas', 'raised', '16th', 'Century', 'European', 'political', 'affairs', 'amply', 'belief', 'importance', 'scripture', 'priesthood', 'believers', 'implication', 'idea', 'salvation', 'should', 'be', 'achieved', 'faith', 'alone', 'major', 'events', 'epiphany', 'thunderstorm', 'up', 'onset', 'peasant', 'revolt', 'challenge', 'German', 'princes', 'rule', 'Emperor', 'Charles', 'V', 'Holy', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'such', 'nicely', 'religious', 'political', 'issues', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'separated', 'Luther', 'time', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'simply', 'focus', 'Luther', 'religious', 'beliefs', '.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'be', 'overly', 'anti-Catholic', 'nature', 'subject', 'matter', 'could', 'give', 'impression.At', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'rather', 'bland', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', 'perspective', 'other', 'emphasis.It', 'also', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'further', 'showing', 'implications', 'Luther', 'Reformation', 'just', 'stop', 'once', 'Emperor', 'going', 'have', 'trouble', 'German', 'princes', 'discussing', 'even', 'mentioning', 'ensuing', 'religious', 'political', 'crises', 'rocked', 'Europe', 'end', 'Thirty', 'Years', 'War', '1648', 'when', 'statecraft', 'national', 'interest', 'finally', 'became', 'more', 'consistent', 'influence', 'religion', 'determining', 'course', 'European', 'political', 'development.Further', 'film', 'not', 'explore', 'WHY', 'HOW', 'Luther', 'became', 'so', 'profoundly', 'changed', 'adequately', 'explain', 'why', 'German', 'princes', 'might', 'have', 'embraced', 'Luther', 'ideas', 'own', 'political', 'fight', 'Holy', 'Roman', 'Emperor', 'Luther', 'character', 'waver', 'tormented', 'soul', 'self-confident', 'professor', 'film', ""n't"", 'explain', 'dramatic', 'swings', 'never', 'quite', 'get', 'know', 'who', 'Luther', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'displaying', 'significant', 'amount', 'doubt', 'contributes', 'feeling', 'inconsistency', 'as', 'well', 'shows', 'internal', 'as', 'well', 'external', 'struggle', 'Luther', 'must', 'have', 'undergone', 'fighting', 'beliefs', 'surely', 'felt', 'be', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'beliefs', 'only', 'true', 'belief', 'way', 'film', 'try', 'understand', 'portray', 'Luther', 'more', 'cardboard', 'character', 'real', 'person', 'not', 'historical', 'icon', 'performance', 'good', 'history', 'should', 'people', 'are', 'full', 'contradictory', 'impulses', 'events', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'differently', 'did.The', 'film', 'therefore', 'human', 'rather', 'religious', 'character', 'much', 'viewer', 'decide', 'Luther', 'not', 'religious', 'propaganda', 'even', 'sympathetic', 'Luther', 'A', 'rather', 'sappy', 'subplot', 'crippled', 'child', 'used', 'film', 'exhibit', 'Luther', 'compassion', 'wonder', 'transparent', 'attempt', 'draw', 'viewers', 'Luther', 'was', 'known', 'exhibit', 'such', 'personal', 'interest.In', 'ways', 'PBS', 'Empires', 'documentary', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'more', 'emotional', 'intellectual', 'punch', 'often', 'more', 'powerfully', 'directed', 'filmed', 'feature', 'film', 'looking', 'deeper', 'more', 'incisive', 'account', 'still', 'dramatic', 'visual', 'emotional', 'component', 'should', 'look', 'there', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'minimal', 'cast', 'interviews', 'mostly', 'irrelevant', 'types', 'religious', 'historical', 'questions', 'film', 'so', 'sense', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'different', 'most', 'DVDs', '.This', 'film', 'easily', 'accessible', 'teenage', 'drawbacks', 'film', 'welcome', 'replacement', 'various', 'older', 'accounts', 'collect', 'dust', 'school', 'shelves', 'due', 'slow', 'storytelling', 'antiquated', 'sensibility', 'film', 'bright', 'lively', 'visually', 'compelling', 'whole', 'simplicity', 'great', 'interested', 'learning', 'seeing', 'dramatization', 'major', 'events', 'Luther', 'Reformation']",N/A

Erikson analyzed the development and the identity crisis of the human being Martin Luther. Erikson had studied under the eyes of the daughter of Sigmund Freud, Anna. Erikson showed in his famous book, how the rage of Luther against his father developed a rage against church-authorities as well. The fire 1517 AD spread and half of Germany went into a battle against the Pope and his followers in Rome. Many blood was shed. The effect: the right to own an individuality reached acceptance against the usual habit of too much patience and submissiveness. That was the inner drive of the Renaissance's cultural evolution. One can find the origins of this emotional-based idea, that it should be necessary, to reach more independence against the educational usage of that time: The father of Martin Luther very often practiced corporal punishment against his son. Luther tried to set an end to those legal, hierarchical and anti-democratic behaviour attitudes. It was a fight against oppression. An example on which later on the human rights, the constitutional laws of modern states have been developed - spreading the idea not only to church patterns, but bringing it just as well to the basis of democracies all over the world too.

829991,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B0002C9D9K,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[4, 6]","Luther is a remarkable film in many ways. One disclaimer should be made -- this is not a documentary, in which the standard phrase about scenes being created or adapted for dramatic purposes would be made. No such disclaimer is given here, but the serious observer watching for history as well as entertainment should be warned not to accept everything at face value.The performances are solid, occasionally stunning. Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare in 'Shakespeare in Love') does an exceptional job portraying Germany's turbulent priest, whose search for knowledge and personal salvation leads him to question all around him. The action moves quickly in the film, collapsing complex historical and theological items into almost single-issue ciphers for clarity in the film -- one might be forgiven for coming away from the film believing that Luther tacked up a declaration of 1 Thesis rather than 95 Theses, and that the Roman church was corrupt entirely. The tension within the church is alluded to in a few spots (the cardinal who hopes for a pope who will save the church, etc.), but by and large, the Roman church is portrayed with a broad brush as evil.The scenes in which the peasants revolt and the people take Luther's messages to extremes are dramatically produced and emotionally moving without being gruesome or needlessly gory. The complexities of the people's wavering support for Luther, and Luther's occasional collaborations against the people, are similarly glossed over.Fiennes is shown in a few points preaching to the people, as a priest and as a street leader -- Luther was known to be an effective preacher and teacher, and this comes across here. Luther's time as a professor of theology is, like much of the story, collapsed into a brief series of scenes, again simplifying the complexity of faculty and academic dealings into a few figures either supporting or worrying about the controversy being stirred.The historical progession is kept fairly accurate, going from early days in ministry and schooling to early awakenings in the light of his travels and teaching, to the Diet of Worms and the final climax of the film taking place in Augsburg, showing the recitation (and assuming the victory) of the Augsburg Confession, a document still recited to this day.Sir Peter Ustinov steals every scene he appears in, as Philip the Wise, an almost bumbling and good-hearted soul, who is probably the most ahistorical figure in the film. Luther's primary sponsors were neither bumbling nor innocent, but rather political animals of the first rank, and to a certain extent, the political side of the Reformation owed as much to military and economic freedom from Roman overlordship and the fracturing of Germanic unity with the slow and steady downfall of what remained of the Holy Roman Empire. This tension is hinted at in the film, particularly in the post-script, but is really secondary to the primary point of the film.Claire Cox portrays Katerina von Borg, the run-away nun who became Luther's wife. Her role is virtually non-existent through most of the film, and save pressuring Luther into deciding to take a wife, she seems to have little role in Luther's political or theological development, which is likewise not true to history. Another key character, Johann Tetzel, the man whose preaching specifically prompted Luther's writing of the 95 Theses, (portrayed by Alfred Molina), is presented as a very one-dimensional and corrupt character only interested in selling indulgences, which is rather far from the truth of Tetzel, also.Despite these drawbacks (understandable, given that in two hours, writers and directors have to be selective in choosing material), there are occasionals glimpses of the fascinating history surrounding church and society during Luther's time -- for instance, the fact that not only were scriptures removed from access to the laity, they were in fact rarely read by the clergy. The character of Luther specifically says that he relies on scripture AND reason (something the sola scriptura crowd tend to forget). The real threat to Christendom from the newly-expanding Muslims lingers in the background (the city of Constantinople, whose walls had been unbreached for a thousand years, had fallen just a few decades prior, and the idea of yet another Crusade against the Muslims was being seriously considered).This film presents a sympathetic figure in Luther, one that the church would have done well to retain rather than cast out -- but then, churches have a tendency to cast out for authoritarian/hierarchical/institutional reasons those they ought to embrace on theological and pastoral grounds. Luther's darker side is only hinted at -- the character says at one point that he is a divisive figure, and this remains true until the end of his life, and even Lutheranism split from other Reformers, and even among itself, as many Lutheran followers modified official Lutheranism into something Luther himself probably would not have been able to accept.In history, Luther gets portrayed with a broad brush as a bold reformer, taking on the powers that be to lead the Western world into an era of Reformation (prompting, not to long after, the Counter-Reformation in the Roman church). In this film, with sensitivity and compassion, Luther is portrayed without too many dimensions (his anti-Judaic stance, for instance, is never even hinted at in the film) but with an aim toward presenting the point -- that it is sometimes worth taking a stand of faith and reason against seemingly incalculable odds.",5,A Reformation Saint,1124668800,"08 22, 2005",2005,5566,"['Luther',

The viewer is given a glimpse into a very human man with doubts, fears, and failings to which we can all relate rather than attempting to elevate him to saintly status (which Luther himself would have deplored anyway).Luther's early beginnings are explored only briefly but sufficiently to show his entry into the priesthood, his strained relationship with his family over his choice of a clerical career, and the influences of his mentors. He begins to question the practices of his church and his internal struggles over both his own faith in God and the wisdom in even daring to question, not to mention speak out against, the decrees of the pope and church hierarchy. Despite his convictions this self-debate continues when he's threatened with death.

Protestants across the globe, who hold the Holy Scriptures in the Bible as their first and highest authority must thank the Lord for using Martin Luther in such a dramatic way to break the grip of darkness that held so many in ignorance with false doctrines and teachings such as purgatory and indulgences.No longer were the Scriptures just reserved for a chosen few, but by his work, the Scriptures were made available for the common man to read in Germany. His work would change the course of the world, forever.The Life of Martin Luther:Martin Luther (10 November 1483 - 18 February 1546) was a German priest and professor of theology. His father, Hans, wanted him to become a lawyer and he attended Latin school from 1497. Between 1501 and 1505 he attended the University of Erfurt where he obtained a Master's Degree.At about that time, he was caught in a lightning storm, and while fearing for his life, he prayed and made a vow to become a monk. At that point he left his ambitions of becoming a lawyer and entered a closed Augustinian friary in Erfurt.The Film:This film starts at Erfurt in 1507, where Luther (Joseph Fiennes) is seen running through a very severe lightning storm. He eventually falls to the ground and prays. From there, his devotion to God and study, promotes him to a position of Doctor. However, at this point he begins to poke fun at the numerous (and obviously fake) relics that the common man is made to pay-per-view. On a more serious side he questions the whole idea of paying money to be absolved from sin. He believes, as contained in the scripture, that it is by faith alone (and not of works, lest any man should boast - Ephesians 2:9). In 1517 Luther nails up his Ninety-Five Theses. This document severely affects the efforts of indulgence salesman Johann Tetzel (Alfred Molina). His sales line is, ""When a coin in the coffer rings, a soul from purgatory springs.""An amazing set of religious and state politics then unfolds, the demand is for him to be sent to Rome, where he would have been most certainly slain. However, he stands trial instead in Worms in 1521. The dramatization of the trial is an eye opener.In my opinion this film has been well executed, the sets, the costumes and the music all relay, Germany of the 16th century.Conclusion:If you are interested in how the whole Protestant reformation was initiated, this film represents a fairly accurate depiction. I recommend that even today, that everyone read the Holy Bible (KJV) and accept it at face value. It can mean the eternal salvation of your soul.",5,Breaking the Status Quo,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,2646,"['Introduction', 'light', 'person', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'end', 'Protestants', 'globe', 'who', 'hold', 'Holy', 'Scriptures', 'Bible', 'first', 'highest', 'authority', 'must', 'thank', 'Lord', 'using', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'such', 'dramatic', 'way', 'break', 'grip', 'darkness', 'held', 'so', 'many', 'ignorance', 'false', 'doctrines', 'teachings', 'such', 'purgatory', 'indulgences.No', 'longer', 'were', 'Scriptures', 'just', 'reserved', 'chosen', 'few', 'work', 'Scriptures', 'were', 'made', 'available', 'common', 'man', 'read', 'Germany', 'work', 'would', 'change', 'course', 'world', 'forever.The', 'Life', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'Martin', 'Luther', '10', 'November', '1483', '18', 'February', '1546', 'was', 'German', 'priest', 'professor', 'theology', 'father', 'Hans', 'wanted', 'become', 'lawyer', 'attended', 'Latin', 'school', '1497', 'Between', '1501', '1505', 'attended', 'University', 'Erfurt', 'where', 'obtained', 'Master', 'Degree.At', 'time', 'was', 'caught', 'lightning', 'storm', 'fearing', 'life', 'prayed', 'made', 'vow', 'become', 'monk', 'point', 'left', 'ambitions', 'becoming', 'lawyer', 'entered', 'closed', 'Augustinian', 'friary', 'Erfurt.The', 'Film', 'film', 'Erfurt', '1507', 'where', 'Luther', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'seen', 'running', 'very', 'severe', 'lightning', 'storm', 'eventually', 'ground', 'prays', 'there', 'devotion', 'God', 'study', 'position', 'Doctor', 'However', 'point', 'poke', 'fun', 'numerous', 'obviously', 'fake', 'relics', 'common', 'man', 'made', 'pay-per-view', 'more', 'serious', 'side', 'questions', 'whole', 'idea', 'paying', 'money', 'be', 'absolved', 'sin', 'contained', 'scripture', 'faith', 'alone', 'not', 'works', 'lest', 'man', 'should', 'boast', 'Ephesians', '2:9', '1517', 'Luther', 'up', 'Ninety-Five', 'Theses', 'document', 'severely', 'efforts', 'indulgence', 'salesman', 'Johann', 'Tetzel', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'sales', 'line', 'When', 'coin', 'coffer', 'rings', 'soul', 'purgatory', 'springs', 'amazing', 'set', 'religious', 'state', 'politics', 'then', 'unfolds', 'demand', 'be', 'sent', 'Rome', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'certainly', 'slain', 'However', 'trial', 'instead', 'Worms', '1521', 'dramatization', 'trial', 'eye', 'opener.In', 'opinion', 'film', 'been', 'well', 'executed', 'sets', 'costumes', 'music', 'relay', 'Germany', '16th', 'century.Conclusion', 'are', 'interested', 'how', 'whole', 'Protestant', 'reformation', 'was', 'initiated', 'film', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'recommend', 'even', 'today', 'everyone', 'read', 'Holy', 'Bible', 'KJV', 'accept', 'face', 'value', 'can', 'mean', 'eternal', 'salvation', 'soul']",N/A

Joseph Fiennes gives a wide-ranging performance as the legendary German monk who had the audacity to force the Catholic hierarchy to face it's own monumental hypocrisy.  I honestly believe Fienne's portrayal of Luther is Oscar worthy, but this is unlikely due to this film's almost total lack of noteriety.The irony of ""Luther"" is the fact that much of what one sees in this movie from religious authority figures is still present today.  There are still far too many who will follow a demogogue if he spouts the right words, and who will all too willingly give up their financial and intellectual independence in search of ""salvation"".Martin Luther's travails helped enable each person to have a personal relationship with God, one not defined by some figure who claimed himself as the lone conduit to heaven.

Clocking in at just over two hours, LUTHER  offers a biography of one of the important periods in history - that of the forming of the Reformation.The story is so well known that it does not bear repeating.  Suffice it to say that the external and internal demons that propelled Martin Luther to break away from the Roman Catholic Church with all its inherent odious evils present at that time during the reign of Pope Leo are presented in an understandable, dramatic way.  Joseph Fiennes as Luther gives an exemplary performance as do the other fine actors cast in this film - Bruno Ganz, Claire Cox, Jonathan Firth, Benjamin Sadler, Marco Hofschneider (remember 'Europa, Europa'?  - he is grown up now), and Mattieu Carriere, among others.  But one of the finest roles in this film is Frederick the Wise as portrayed in the last hurrah of Sir Peter Ustinov. This is an award winning performance.The accompanying featurettes of actors discussing the film and the story are quite good - especially Ustinov's cogent evaluation of Fiennes as an actor, the credibility of the sets and costumes, etc.  Yes, there are errors of omission (Luther was far more than a revolutionary), but the overall feeling after the final scene in LUTHER is one of having witnessed a solid flashback to a moving historical incident.

Pouliot,"[12, 16]","Well-crafted and gorgeously-costumed, ""Luther"" depicts the main events in the evolution of Martin Luther, from self-lacerating Augustinian monk to the scourge of all things Roman Catholic. A devout RC myself, I was surprised how watchable and re-watchable the film is. It more-or-less fairly depicts the characters of the day, from Pope Leo X to John Tetzel. The film does a great job of translating into action what is generally a work of the mind: the mainly theological arguments and objections that Luther had to the ""works"" that were part-and-parcel of Catholic medieval piety. Catholics might be surprised at the reasonableness of Luther's issues with the Church, while Protestants might be surprised at the blood that was spilled on account of this man.I did object to some of the characterizations. Joe Fiennes played Luther with a gentleness that was not Luther's strong point. I also doubted Sir Peter Ustinov's take on Prince Frederick of Saxony. Far from being a cutely cunning old monarch -- a recurring role in Ustinov's later work -- Frederick was a man who nearly single-handedly fended off a Roman Church that was dying to get its hands on Luther. And Albert Molina's John Tetzel was tepid and warm-hearted -- not at all the fiery orator who raked in the scads of indulgence money and scandalized the faithful with his blasphemous claim to be able to pardon even the man who violated the Mother of God herself. On the other hand, Bruno Ganz's depiction of Luther's Augustinian abbot was nuanced and versatile. His scenes were the most dramatic of the film.No question, the movie (underwritten by a Lutheran insurance company) was meant to be sympathetic to Luther. It spun Luther's story into a classic Hollywood tale -- the humble man of the earth, naively seeking to reform a hopelessly corrupt and cynical organization. The film ill serves history, however, as the real Luther was a different animal altogether. The film downplays Luther's violent side, depicting his horror at the blood shed (with his sanction) in the Peasants' Rebellion. But the Luther of history wrote these words: ""Let everyone who can, smite, slay, and stab, secretly or openly, remembering that nothing can be more poisonous, hurtful, or devilish than a rebel."" It's a shame the film tried to sugarcoat this troubling record.In spite of its flaws, the movie brilliantly brings to life the contradictory times of the 16th century, providing images on which to hang future studies of the man who faced down the mightiest power of his time.

830011,A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y,B0002C9D9K,Jeffrey A. Thompson,"[38, 41]","Makers of this film tried to be historically accurate. It covered Luther's life and times from when he gives his vow to Saint Anne to turn his life over to God and joins the Augustines to when the German princes stand up to Emperor Charles. I have read a couple of biographies of Luther and the movie related the main facts of Luther's life well. The movie also showed the evil of indulgences and the abuses of the Catholic church at the time in history. For these reasons alone, I think the movie should be viewed. To understand the times we live in, we must understand the Reformation.However, the movie misses somehow. I am not sure where. The passage of time is confusing. Characters make references to the passage of time, so you know that several years go by, but you are never sure how many years. They usually show it by different lengths of hair of the main characters.  The movie misses on an emotional level sometimes, but it does score some direct hits. I think Fiennes is miscast as Luther, but he tries hard. Ustinov is very charming as Prince Frederick.

830014,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B0002C9D9K,J. Michael,"[16, 36]","""Luther"", a hagiographic biopic funded by the Lutheran church, succeeds in little more than telling us that Martin Luther was a Great Man. Although the cinematography is sumptuous and the actors compentent, it is, for the most part, historically inaccurate, dramatically dull and even surprisingly fails to give more than a cursory glance at Luther's main ideas. I can't see ""Luther"" appealing to anyone but die-hard Protestants and people who like boring movies.This movie presents us with a sensitive, matinee-idol Martin Luther, who befriends a young peasant mother and her crippled daughter, who defies the Church to bury a suicide on holy ground, and who- presumably- mends the broken wings of sparrows and heads the Greater Wittenberg district recycling program. This sentimentalized Luther is scandalized by the immorality of the Roman clergy and the sale of indulgences and so asserts a number of vague propositions of which the Catholic Church vehemently disapproves. (If one weren't already familiar with the history, they could easily miss what Luther actually stood for. I believe this movie allots one line each to the exposition of Sola Fide and Sola Scriptura). Luther refuses to recant, he translates the Bible into German, gets married and everyone lives happily ever after, except for some misguided peasants who get slaughtered after making the mistake of taking Luther at his word and interpreting the Bible for themselves. ""Luther"" may reinforce various self-congratulatory Protestant myths, but it does no service to history and truth. (Or cinema, for that matter.)Although the modern Lutheran church is too ecumenical to really demonize Catholicism (as its founder was wont to do), this movie is full of many of the old legends invented out of whole cloth by Luther himself or his followers. We are supposed to believe that an Augustinian monk, an order renowned for its education and Biblical scholarship, never saw a Bible until he was in his 20s. We are also supposed to believe that Luther's German translation of the Bible was the first time the Scriptures were made available in the vernacular, when in fact there had been many German translations before his. The theology of indulgences is distorted and misrepresented, even in the dramatization of their (admitted) abuse. Minor fabrications include Luther's reason for joining a monastery (parental sadism, not a lightning-induced vow), his nailing of the 95 Theses to the church door (they were actually mailed to a Bishop), his dramatic assertion of ""Here I Stand, I Can Do No Other"""" (never spoken), and a vile blasphemy attributed to a thoroughly caricaturized Johann Tetzel.Missing is the gutter-mouthed, fire-breathing, hate-filled man of violence who advocated the dispossession and enslavement of the Jews ( a stance that gave Hitler much ammunition) and the extermination of rebellious peasants and all religious groups that didn't follow his ideas (Catholics, Anabaptists, et al.) Far from representing the ideal of religious freedom, as the movie's epilogue states, Luther's revolution represented persecution, state control of the church and the vile doctrine of ""Cuius regio, eius religio"" (the faith of the ruler is the faith of the people.) As the nobility's rapacity made the Reformation possible in the first place, it was the state that was its main benefactor. We are also not shown the Martin Luther whose basic antinomianism and submissiveness to the nobility allowed him to connive in the bigamy of Phillip the Magnanimous. We also do not see the Luther who, when he inserted the word ""alone"" into Romans 3:28, edited Scripture to support his theology, when in fact the only place in the Bible where the words ""faith alone"" are to be found together is in James 2:24 where it says that it does_not_justify us. We do not see the Luther who removed 7 books from the Old Testament canon, and would have removed several other books, including Ecclesiastes, Esther, James, Hebrews, Jude & Revelation, had he the power. Nor does this movie show us the various lies Luther's own letters convict him of. If Luther had good points, he also had a dark side, and I'm not sure if the movie medium can properly capture the complexity.

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[164, 171]","There have been a lot of movies recently about God (Bruce Almighty) and faith (Dancing at Lughnasa), but many of them have avoided mentioning one word: Christ.  Luther breaks that trend by addressing the foundation figure of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther.  This film unabashedly presents the man as both a fallible human being, with crushing fits of self-doubt, and a man in constant pursuit of the mind of God, a man who changed the face of Europe.Luther was and is an ambiguous figure to many, and this movie doesn't try to simplify anything.  We see Luther (Joseph Fiennes) in the most productive and tumultuous years of his life, with the movie ending abruptly after the Augsburg Confession.  The character of Luther's sponsor, Philip the Wise (Sir Peter Ustinov), is cut down, making him a friendly figure where he was in fact a shrewd politician who tried to use Luther's opinions as a way to enrich state coffers.  The figure of Karlstadt (Jochen Horst) is real and receives comment, but the film doesn't really permit Luther to endorse or condemn his rebellion.  Luther's wife and sometime foil, the sharp and witty Katerina von Borg (Claire Cox), doesn't even appear until near the end of the film.  And Johann Tetzel (Alfred Molina), whose abuses spurred Luther's greatest accomplishments, is treated like a straw man.This movie seems structured at times like a Cliffs Notes of Luther's life and work.  Perhaps it's intended to encourage the viewing public to read the books themselves and find out who Luther was.  It's certainly not a technical tour-de-force.  The opening is cut together with the same abruptness as a trailer, Luther's conversions (he had three, each more profound than the last, like stairsteps) are compressed, the camera is usually unmoving, like a portable stage.But the movie is strong, accurately reflecting who Luther was and what he did.  Running just under two hours and allowing plenty of room for the circumstances of Luther's day, it's easy to watch.  The environment, including land and cityscapes, are well rendered, the light and sound are clear, and the colors pop.Plainly, this isn't a general-interest film.  People who watch it are at least curious about Luther's work, if not already familiar with it.  But for a theological art-house movie, it's a cut above most of what's been made in recent years, and eminently watchable.

830024,A2VUP5US1F5HG5,B0002C9D9K,K. Jump,"[15, 16]","This is the well-told story of Martin Luther, the monk whose lifelong quest for spiritual truth and the real essence of Christianity ultimately unleashed one of the greatest upheavals in Western history--the Protestant Reformation.  Joseph Fiennes plays the passionate, often tormented Luther with conviction and depth, and the carefully crafted script is for the most part historically accurate, and portrays a flesh-and-blood Luther who is never bigger than life but is somehow therefore all the more inspiring.  The supporting cast is generally excellent, particularly the great Peter Ustinov in what was destined to be his last movie appearance.  Cinematography and direction are likewise solid, and the distant past is brought vividly to life, including the unfortunate religious abuses which were running amok in the Church at the time.  Human nature being what it is, many were bound to exploit Luther's revolutionary doctrines for their own purposes, and though never exploitative, the film doesn't hesitate to show the bloody side-effects of Luther's revolutionary doctrine, as unforeseen mayhem and carnage sweep over an uneasy Germany.  Luther's own eventual romance and marriage is also highlighted, and though it is dealt with fairly briefly the relationship's inherent intensity shines through.  The only reason I don't give this otherwise outstanding feature five stars is that the second half of the film, in which Germany teeters on the brink of sheer chaos, is somewhat uneven. The first half, focused on Luther's gradual realization of how the contemporary Church has obscured the Gospel, is tighter and more engaging than the more event-driven second stanza, which may lose some viewers if they are not already familiar with the story.

830025,A2I5XLUCBTKQE4,B0002C9D9K,Kolchak the Night Stalker,"[17, 51]","This movie depicts Catholicism in one dimension: corrupt, superstitious, political, and full of pagan practices.  Luther is portrayed as a saviour and a champion of authentic Christianity. I don't want to debate Lutheran thought vs. Catholic dogma but I will say that the movie fails to show John Eck's debate with Luther in an authentic way. Eck, in real life, was able to effectively prove Luther to be dubious and incorrect in several areas.  Luther suffered from deep depression and paranoia.  that is well documented. He said things like: ""We must bathe ourselves in the blood of the popes and bishops"" and ""Go ahead and sin, and sin boldly! for a thousand times a man may commit adultery and Christ will forgive!"" and other insane blabbery....Luther also studied heretical works and criticism of the Church before his ""revelations,"" this wasn't shown.  He studied Hussite texts and other anti-Catholic writings.There is also a suicide scene in the movie at the beginning where Luther forgives a corpse that committed suicide and buries the body declaring its forgiveness, etc.The movie pumps up Luther and makes Catholics look like morons. The Catholic debate is stunted and silenced.  The movie is also hurried.  The teachings of indulgences are not clearly explained. there WERE abuses of them but the concept itself is poorly innumerated.There are some good scenes albeit few.  The scenes with Tetzel and Luther's trip to Rome are decent but his trial is goofy and his marriage is shown to be a romance!! Luther himself said that marriage was a drudgery and that he only married out of a sense of duty and to show an example to his brethren!! He didn't have a passion for Catherine Von Bora like the movie shows us.  It was a marriage of convenience and circumstance, not passion.This movie is hurried, poorly researched, and pretty cheesy in general. Avoid it if you have an intellect.

830028,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002C9D9K,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 17]","I have no doubt that Martin Luther was a complex man, but I am not sure that he was a mixture of such contradictory elements as played by Joseph Fiennes in this 2003 biopic.  It is not so much the juxtaposition of the private Luther berating himself for his doubts and shortcomings with the monk who stands up to the power of the Catholic Church, but rather the sight of the intellectual who ridicules a world overflowing with holy relics and the selling of indulgences (apparently 16 of the 12 disciples of Jesus are buried in Spain).  He has his fellow theological students laughing at the absurdity of the system they support, and it is the one point in the film where you get a sense that Luther might have had charisma to go along with his superior intellect and absolute convictions.The screenplay by Bart Gavigan and Camille Thomasson starts with Luther as a law student who is converted during a lightning storm and becomes a brilliant monk who knows his scripture far better than his teachers.  When Luther is sent to Rome he is less impressed by the relative grandeur of the Holy City as he is by the selling of indulgences.  Alfred Molina plays Johann Tetzel, a priest who pushes every button he can to get the poor to spend their money getting their loved ones out of Purgatory.  Pope Leo XII (Uwe Ochsenknecht) acts more like he is running organized crime rather than the Catholic Church, and Luther sees no value in accepting the dictates from Rome on such suspect authority when he can read the New Testament for himself.  The film wants us to think that it is religion that matters back home in Saxony, where Frederick the Wise (Peter Ustinov) enjoys his collection of holy relics, and so it glosses over the power politics at work that fuled the Reformation (just as it did in England when Henry VIII founded the Church of England).  But for many of the German princes Luther's theological arguments represented an opportunity to break away from the power of Rome and claim more for themselves.Ultimately, it seems that the pontiff's problem is that he does not have the right people to rid him of this troublesome monk.  The Pope's point man is the papal adviser Cirolamo Aleandro (Jonathan Firth), who clearly sees the threat that Luther poses to the Church and knows Luther needs to be excommunicated (and worse), but is in over his head when he goes to Germany to manipulate the princes into doing what needs to be done.  Ironically, since the hierarchy of the Church have been buying their offices at a young age, it seems their inexperience in the world of real politik leads to their undoing (although there is a character who suggests the Church realized a need to reform itself but suffered from having a weak leader instead of its own Luther).From a theological perspective you basically get the Cliffs Notes version of Martin Luther's beliefs.  We see Luther dramatically nail his 95 theses to the doors of the great church in Wittenberg, but the complex argument they lay out is reduced to the idea that scripture does not support the idea of indulgences.  His refusal to recant his writings before the Diet of Worms is soft-spoken but also somewhat dramatic, and when he challenges his accusers to show that he is wrong through rational argument and scriptural evidence, you know that they cannot simply because no one in the film argues with Luther.  They tell him he is wrong, that he should recant, and that he should submit to the authority of Rome, but they never advance an argument beyond the idea of following precedent.Unfortunately, the film want to advance the idea that the most subversive thing Luther did was to translate the New Testament into German.  He spends a lot of time doing this, demanding a really good Greek-Latin dictionary, and several characters note that this is the thing Rome fears the most, but the payoff for this has to be a necessarily simple scene in which he presents the finished New Testament to the man to whom it is dedicated.  We understand that if the common folk can read scripture for themselves, then they will know when priests, popes, and others are making up new rules about how someone enters the kingdom of Heaven.  But the moment is one of a series of anti-climatic scenes that end the film, when Luther quickly marries an ex-nun and finds out the Reformation he started just might make it after all.By first understanding of the Reformation was that the pivotal argument was that people did not need priests or anyone else to intercede for them with God because a direct and personal relationship exists between the human beings and God.  ""Luther"" does get us a bit beyond that basic Protestant idea, although primarily it indicts the corruption of the Catholic Church.  Luther speaks of a more loving God than do his competitors, but basically the idea here is that given the corruption in Rome, anything would be better, even if that means a Holy War of sorts between the two classes of believers that now exist and as many as 100,000 dead.  Such a number gives Luther pause, and when it seems like he is having second thoughts it becomes clear that this version of Martin Luther really does not appreciate how he is changing the world.",4,A

He makes a pact to God that if he survives, he will dedicate his life to the Lord as a monk. While scrubbing the floors of what looks in what looks to be a terrible assignment, Luther gets the opportunity of a lifetime, to study at a leading European seminary. At this point, he has not even read the New Testament, which was only available in Latin, a language more than 99% of the public could not read.Luther turns out to be a brilliant student and ends up a Professor of Theology at the college. His chair is paid for by the Roman Catholic Church. After a visit to Rome in the early 1520s, Luther is distraught at the corruption permeating from the city, including the sale of holy relics and indulgences with the promise of fewer years in purgatory. This trip prompts him to post the '95 Theses' a comprehensive list of abuses by officials in the Church. Important to note is that Luther was a devout Catholic, he only wanted to reform the Church--not start a new religion. Of course, one thing led to another and the German theologian finds himself at the seat of the Inquisition, which is known for excommunicating those displeased with the Church, and more than a few summary executions.Joseph Fiennes does an outstanding job as Martin Luther, but he alone cannot carry the film. The editing is extremely choppy and supporting cast lacking. Dramatic dialogue is not properly frames and key events in history seem to be afterthoughts, often just a quick flash on the screen sans explanation.I believe Martin Luther is a hero to both Protestant and Catholics, since he inspired that Protestant Reformation as well as the Catholic Counter-Reformation. It is disappointing that this film falls below the standards of more recent biopicsRay (Full Screen Edition)andWalk the Line (Full Screen Edition), which portrayed men who had far less influence on world history than Martin Luther.

John Osborne's play ""Luther"" had some delightful dialogue and a wonderful build in the speeches.  This production directed by Eric Till also is powerful.  Since his cinematic breakthrough year in 1998 when Joseph Fiennes was in both ""Shakespeare In Love"" & ""Elizabeth,"" he has continued to do good work with a bit lower profile.  His portrayal of Luther shows him to be earnest and honest to a fault, taking his faith struggles as a priest seriously while asking the profound questions that put him on a collision course with Rome.  As Luther's mentor, Peter Ustinov delivers a compassionate and delightful performance as King Frederick the Wise.  It has been a long while since Ustinov's 2 Oscar wins for supporting actor in Spartacus (1960) & Topkapi (1964).  His long career is well reflected in the depth of performance given here.  Bruno Ganz does a great job as Luther's father/confessor, Father Johann von Staupitz.  Alfred Molina who recently battled Spiderman in the second movie about that cartoon hero and also played as the anti-chocolate authority in ""Chocolat"" does a good job here as John Tetzel who sells indulgences so people can buy their way to forgiveness.  After Luther's ex-communication from the Catholic church, he marries Katharina von Bora who is ably played by a knowing Claire Cox.

It does not sugar coat Luther or the factions involved with his movement. Some might view it as anti-Catholic, but the actions of the Catholic Church at the time merely reflect the way things were at the time.

Joseph Fiennes is cast as the title role.  He's a good actor, but he just doesn't come across with the degree of passion that must have inspired the real Martin Luther, a German monk who defied the power of Rome.  At that time, the Church was everything and there were abuses everywhere.  Most notably was the selling of ""indulgences"" which meant that for a money donation to the Church, an individual could ""buy"" himself or a relative out of purgatory.  Martin Luther saw the absurdity of this and wrote a paper which he nailed to the church wall.  This, of course, angered Rome.  A  bloody war followed where more than 50,000 people were killed.This is an over-simplification, of course. There were many nuances to the upheaval at the time.  Frederick the Great, played by Peter Ustinov, was the German king.  He is presented as an over-indulged child who loves to play with his power.  But he believes in Martin Luther and supports him throughout.  He takes delight in challenging Rome and eventually breaking away from the Church.  Seemingly, now, religion was to belong to the common people because Martin Luther translated the bible into German.Everything is just a little too pat, especially Martin Luther's romance and marriage to a former nun near the end of the film.  Even though history tells us that he did marry and have children, their relationship seemed much too modern to have happened that way.I must say though that in spite of the film's weaknesses, which included some slow parts, I did enjoy it.

Unfortunately, these teachings cut into the earnings of both the local secular prince and the church hierarchy. He also translated the New Testament from Latin into German, making it much more accessible to the people and weakening the power of the priesthood to say what it meant and didn't mean. (Previously others had translated his 95 Theses into German and widely distributed them via the printing press.)Eventually Luther was excommunicated and declared an outlaw; fortunately he was safeguarded by the local prince.

However, I must say that for us history and church history buffs it is fairly correct and should be enlightening to those not familiar with the Protestant Reformation in Germany.However, the film is not well done.  Joseph Finnes, as Martin Luther, is adequate in the role but just.. I think that is a major flaw in the film.  He acts with passion but doesn't convince us this is really Luther.  Besides there is no physical resemblance I could determine. And the love story...now this might have been interesting considering the biographical data but it simply is inadequate and limps along in very abbreviated scenes with little or no chemistry between Luther and his ex-nun wife.Peter Uskinov as the German prince who supports Luther gives credibility to his part. He steals almost every seen in which he appears.  Without him the movie would have completely missed the mark.  We become aware of his every gesture and grimace.  A great actor, gone now, who will be missed!The crowd scenes are contrived. But we are given a fairly accurate glimpse into the corruption of the Church at that time in history with the selling of indulgences, political contriving, and indifference to the poor on the part of the clergy.  Domincans in particular come off pretty black rather than white in their black and white habits.  Albert Molina plays John Trexel, a Dominican who was the Pope's indulgence hengeman, but even he seems somewhat out of place on the set.Luther is made to be more of a revolutionary than a dedicated believer. It is never clear what has truly made the German princes revolt although we know they do and did.We are given no background as to why Luther has his wrestling matches with the devil which include  confusing jargon and fit like rolling around. There are hints it may have had something to do with his relationship with his father...but we never really know for sure. Certainly it is never stated this behavior came from a repressed conscience, and it does not  end when he at least expresses that conscience in the ""Here, I stand scene."" -- perhaps the movie's worst underplayed moment.  If only Finnes had spoken that a little louder and with a bit more conviction...like I am guessing the real Martin Luther did.Many years ago someone made a film on the life of Francis of Assisi starring Bradford Dillman. It was just as contrived and unreal and poorly acted as this one.  Later a good one was made called, ""Brother Sun, Sister Moon.""

I cannot and I will not retract anything, for it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience.""~ Martin Luther / Diet of Worms, April 1521_______Martin Luther - late medieval European monk, priest, scholar and preacher - was the founder of a full-scale `Reformation' from within Catholicism (the first major movement to mark the end of what is called the Dark Ages). His life's work and influence became central to the development of Western civilization. For that, he has been called the most influential German who ever lived.Luther was born in Eisleben, of Saxony, Germany, on 10 November 1483. His father desired that he become a lawyer, and early on Martin pursued legal studies, to that end gaining entrance into the University of Erfurt in 1501. However, as it would happen (or so he wrote in his :Tischreden:), in early July 1505, he was walking home ... only to be overcome by a thunderstorm, and shouted: ""Help me, St. Anne, I'll become a monk!"" He then joined the Augustinian Hermits at Erfurt, foregoing any career in law. In 1507, he was ordained a priest. Many a monk were supposed, through much hard prayer, fasting and self-inflicted pain, to have found favor with God. Luther, however, continually feared the ""terror and agony of sudden death,"" according to his later :De Votis Monasticis:. His own conversion - the nature of which involved personal trust in Jesus Christ for the divine `favor' and salvation he had been seeking - seems to have occurred around 1509 when, pouring over Psalms and Paul, he came to discover that forgiveness of sin was a gift to be received, by faith, not some high-up goal for which to toil and slave ritualisticly. Luther received a doctorate in theology in 1512, upon which he began a career teaching biblical exposition at Wittenberg University. Two of his most paramount motifs were salvation by faith alone (sola fide) and Scripture as the only abiding authority (sola scriptura). He took issue with the Roman Church on a wide number of points, but none stirred it to action as much as did one action in the fall of 1517. In response to the grossly exaggerated peddling of indulgences by Dominican monk Johann Tetzel (undertaken obstensibly to repair St. Peter's Basilica in Rome), he drafted a lengthy list of necessary disagreements with standard doctrine. According to tradition, on October 31 - All Saint's eve - Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-five Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, in full view of the public. (Among the many points were his insistence that Christian repentance was holistic and his emphasis that the church's truest treasure was the Gospel.) The archbishop of Mainz passed the theses along to Rome. Almost the immediate reaction was a student-led burning of his writings. For the rest of the decade, Luther often stressed a ""theology of the cross,"" that is, Christ as crucified. Rome eventually published a papal bull (:Exsurge Domine:) against Luther, which he personally burned in front of Wittenberg's Elster Gate: ""Because you have corrupted God's truth, may God destroy you in this fire."" His three tractal works - ""Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation,"" ""A Prelude to the Babylonian Captivity of the Church,"" and ""Of the Freedom of the Christian Man"" - only heightened the problem for Rome. Luther, all the while, thought himself restrained in his denunciations. By 1521, he had more or less sent Germany into an uproar against, among other things, the papacy, which published a bull stating his official excommunication. And at the formal diet, held this year in Worms, Martin Luther stood face to face with emperor and pope. It was demanded of him that he retract statements from many of his writings. When Luther refused, and gave a simple reason for the refusal, he was dismissed from company but declared an outlaw, with a condemnatory sentence passed on his writings. The event actually became a victory for Luther, who had sought something like the impartiality of the audience there present. But matters, especially political ones, were not so simple. Despite enormous popularity, Luther had made serious enemies. His efforts to `reform' the Church came at a high price, and his very life was endangered more than once. On one occasion, while he was traveling, a band of loyalists `kidnapped' him from his wagon (because the roads could be very dangerous); they then holed him up to keep him safe from his enemies. Over the years, Luther continued his work as a scholar, writing for the public, creating Bibles and other materials in the peoples' own language of German. In addition to the writings listed above, eventually published were his University lectures on the biblical books of Psalms (1513-15), Romans (1515-16), Galatians (1516-17), and Hebrews (1517-18). When in 1546 he died, the movement he ignited was very well on its way to becoming a worldwide phenomenon.MGM's 2003 release, LUTHER, attempts to re-enact this life, and gets much right. This is not a bad movie; at the same time, it could have been better. For one thing, the historical Martin Luther was an unusually bold individual. While we experience some of this in Fiennes' portrayal, we don't sense that deep-seated conviction Martin Luther must have possessed (one of Roger Ebert's points). Fiennes does well at bringing out Luther's intellectual side, but one would nonetheless like to see the FIRE! in his eyes.Fortunately for LUTHER, there are other areas in which the creative license employed is not extravagant: Luther has a chat with the elector Frederick, despite that there is no record of such a meeting (it is possible, though I'm not sure where likelihood actually falls). Also, there is an early abundance of Luther ranting alone: to himself, to God, to Satan. As a young priest, Martin Luther did struggle with the notions of sin, judgment, and the mercy of God, as well as an anger and hatred toward such a god, so he very well may have had similar private moments. However, the movie goes further to suggest that some of this spilled over into his later, presumably more assured, life.While I'm not certain as to what else Martin Luther experts might say about these things, I suspect most will point out that it would perhaps have been helpful, indeed appropriate, to have had LUTHER devote more time to :sola fide: (faith alone, something of a motto for the doctrine of justification by faith). This was a major point of his, over against the revived proto-Pelagianism (to borrow Tom Wright's term) of the current Roman church.But what makes the least sense was Fiennes' admitted decision to show us a Luther who has some underlying doubt or reserve. If he wanted to add something `else' to the persona, doubt was the wrong element. Serious biographical movies have a responsibility to paint their characters with historically accurate colors; thus to visualize, and then commit to film, a Luther who is rather doubtful - when so much of the historical Luther's behavior and personality ran clearly in the opposite direction - hardly advances the art or task of responsible movie-making.On the upside, Sir Peter Ustinov is amusing to watch as Frederick the Wise, and takes his character more seriously than do most others. Alfred Molina is likewise good as Tetzel who, as a clerical puppet, feels at times like a sincere theological overstatement. And I imagine most of the apparel used was appropriate to the time.The DVD contains the original theatrical trailer and explanatory snippets from four of the major actors: Joseph Fiennes, Claire Cox,

A revolution was started after he posted his 95 theses denouncing Papal abuses to the Wittenberg Church.  Western Civilization underwent a dramactic change because of the Reformation, which had a lot to do with the concept of the ""priesthood of all believers.""In regards to this film the acting was very powerful, supporting cast as well.  Also I was rather surprised about the accuracy with which was clearly important for the director of the film.  There is no doubt that it definitely had a pro-Luther slant.

The movie shows very little of the darker side of Luther, a gloomy manic depressive who was prone to fanatical outbursts, antisemitism, and called his enemies foul names.  Those in charge of the Roman Church at the time were not particularly interested in spiritual matters, nor in alleviating the suffering of Christ's faithful as the Gospels commanded them to do.

One gets a feeling while watching it that we're back in the 1500s, witnessing events for ourselves.  I really don't know about any of the controversy surrounding this film, as I only discovered it on DVD recently.  I watched, curious to know about Martin Luther, since I know so little about him, and how the Protestant Reformation came into being.Joseph Fiennes is perfect in his performance as Martin Luther.  At times, he can be studiously serious, while at others, playful and funny, as well as stone cold defiant and stubborn.  We see glimpses of his self-berating abuse, his boldness in questioning certain religious practices (particularly the selling of indulgences), and his refusal to recant his 95 Theses.  My favorite scene is when he is giving a lecture, poking fun at all the believers who buy religious relics that were claimed to be from Christ's time, and how the indulgences bought will save relatives from the eternal torments of hell.  In that scene, he speaks in an interesting manner, quite amusing and one can't help but laugh along with him.This film is exactly how to make a historical film (in contrast to the dismally dark ""King Arthur"" with its focus on battle scenes at the expense of plot and dialogue).  If only more films would be made of this caliber, of historical topics (a film about Galileo, anyone?) that are just as relevant today.  This film sets the bar quite high because it is simply brilliant and beautifully done.  Remarkable!  Churches especially should encourage members to see this film, and discuss in Sunday School issues of today and how they relate to what Martin Luther did (being able to see what's truly relevant from what is merely church dogma meant to control people instead of actually help people).

The peasant's revolt is brought back several years and combined it with Karlstadt's radical reforms (K made changes in worship without educating first, smashed statues and images, and tried to introduce civil reforms while Luther was in the Wartburg Castle {1521}).Fiennes portays Luther with warmth and humanity in all parts of the movie. The Niall MacGinnis movie (1953) portrayed Luther in a bit more heroic light. Stacy Keach (1974) portayed Luther first as disturbed, then as bold, then as arrogant.Other drawbacks-- the scene about the young boy's suicide and Luther's comment about him being just as much a victim as a man killed by bandits in the woods and still may receive God's mercy-- is taken from Luther's Table Talk, where he went on to say that common people should not be told this or everyone will be killing themselves. It was a scene that should have been left out.It is a fair introduction to the history.

830054,A2ZQ0IWH69117P,B0002C9D9K,"P. Burdick ""pataburd2""","[20, 48]","Admittedly, Luther came to full stature in the foment of ecclesiastical abuses that characterized his time.  If Pope Leo had responded more promptly, more seriously and more courteously to Luther's legitimate objections, perhaps this unrivaled explosion of heresy and schism, i.e., the Protestant Reformation,  might have been avoided.  Unfortunately, in the end, Luther threw out the proverbial baby with the bathwater.What the film does not tell, and what a good history of the Protestant Reformation should, is the misery, remorse, drunkeness, bitterness and self-aggrandizement of an aged Luther in the aftermath of chaos and destruction brought upon Europe and the world from what had degenerated into his--and his fellow reformers'--ultimate quest for power (ironically, the very power they accused Rome of abusing).  The film did give us--although to an inadequate degree of counter balance--a glimpse of the Peasants' Revolt, as a logical outcome of Luther's casting down of all authority, save his own.It is common knowledge that Luther erroneously translated the text of Romans to append the word ""alone"" alongside the word ""faith,"" crudely endorsed the drowning of Jews who would not submit to baptism, discarded seven books from the Old Testament canon that had been in Church use for over 1000 years prior, advocated the removal of seven more books from the New Testament canon, including Hebrews, James (the letter written by one of Our Lord's twelve apostles that Luther called an ""epistle of straw,"" because it flatly contradicted Luther's doctrinal innovation of ""sola fide"") and The Apocalypse (Revelation).  I would also like to point out to another reviewer that there were as many as 20 vernacular translations of Scripture extant in Germany prior to Luther's; translations undertaken by Roman Catholic(!) initiative.No doubt, Luther's advancement of private interpretation of Scripture (and commensurate denial of the Church's authoritative Teaching Magisterium) eventually paved the way for Rationalism and the Enlightenment which was to strip Truth of any supernatural component at all, making Church-less (and now godless) man the sole authority.  Note mainline Protestantism's modern day lapse into relativism, and the endless fission of denominationalism (currently, there are upwards of 20,000 or more  Protestant schisms in the U.S. alone): Luther's legacy, indeed!  Martin Luther glibly ""prophesied"" the complete demise of the Roman Catholic Church within 100 years of the onset of the Reformation; the ""Papist"" Church endures, nevertheless, to this very day.This is not a viscious attack on Luther, Lutherans or Protestants (something I used to be myself), only a sober reminder that there is much more to the story than what this movie--as well filmed and well produced as it is--shows, with the end of Luther's life being quite different from what the end of this movie might otherwise lead the viewer to believe.If Catholics have to ""take their lumps"" (to the extent of apologizing for their albeit legitimate part in the abuses of the past), then, in a turn-about of fair play, Protestants should also ""take theirs.""  The problem is that few Protestants will take an objective and discerning look at Christian history in the fifteen centuries prior to Luther, nor even--as is apparent from this film--in the turbulent, telling and destabilizing decades following his posting of the ""Ninety-Five Theses.""  As John Henry Cardinal Newman, that well-known, 19th century convert from Anglicanism, so aptly commented: ""To go deep into history is the death of Protestantism.""It's the end of a man's days that offers final proof of a life lived well, no matter how high-sounding, charismatic and well received its beginnings.  A closer look at the end of Luther's life will dispel the myth suggested by this film, which leaves us with a deceptively triumphant and severely truncated biography of the ""Father of Lutheranism.""",2,Not the Whole Story,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,3951,"['Admittedly', 'Luther', 'came', 'full', 'stature', 'foment', 'ecclesiastical', 'abuses', 'characterized', 'time', 'Pope', 'Leo', 'had', 'responded', 'more', 'promptly', 'more', 'seriously', 'more', 'courteously', 'Luther', 'legitimate', 'objections', 'perhaps', 'unrivaled', 'explosion', 'heresy', 'schism', 'i.e.', 'Protestant', 'Reformation', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'Unfortunately', 'end', 'Luther', 'threw', 'out', 'proverbial', 'baby', 'bathwater.What', 'film', 'not', 'tell', 'what', 'good', 'history', 'Protestant', 'Reformation', 'should', 'misery', 'remorse', 'drunkeness', 'bitterness', 'self-aggrandizement', 'aged', 'Luther', 'aftermath', 'chaos', 'destruction', 'brought', 'Europe', 'world', 'what', 'had', 'degenerated', 'fellow', 'reformers', 'ultimate', 'quest', 'power', 'ironically', 'very', 'power', 'accused', 'Rome', 'abusing', 'film', 'did', 'give', 'inadequate', 'degree', 'counter', 'balance', 'glimpse', 'Peasants', 'Revolt', 'logical', 'outcome', 'Luther', 'casting', 'authority', 'save', 'own.It', 'common', 'knowledge', 'Luther', 'erroneously', 'translated', 'text', 'Romans', 'append', 'word', 'alone', 'word', 'faith', 'crudely', 'endorsed', 'drowning', 'Jews', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'submit', 'baptism', 'discarded', 'seven', 'books', 'Old', 'Testament', 'canon', 'had', 'been', 'Church', 'use', '1000', 'years', 'prior', 'advocated', 'removal', 'seven', 'more', 'books', 'New', 'Testament', 'canon', 'including', 'Hebrews', 'James', 'letter', 'written', 'one', 'Lord', 'twelve', 'Luther', 'called', 'epistle', 'straw', 'flatly', 'contradicted', 'Luther', 'doctrinal', 'innovation', 'sola', 'fide', 'Apocalypse', 'Revelation', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'reviewer', 'were', 'as', 'many', '20', 'vernacular', 'translations', 'Scripture', 'extant', 'Germany', 'prior', 'Luther', 'translations', 'undertaken', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'initiative.No', 'doubt', 'Luther', 'advancement', 'private', 'interpretation', 'Scripture', 'commensurate', 'denial', 'Church', 'authoritative', 'Teaching', 'Magisterium', 'eventually', 'paved', 'way', 'Rationalism', 'Enlightenment', 'was', 'strip', 'Truth', 'supernatural', 'component', 'making', 'Church-less', 'now', 'godless', 'man', 'sole', 'authority', 'Note', 'mainline', 'Protestantism', 'modern', 'day', 'lapse', 'relativism', 'endless', 'fission', 'denominationalism', 'currently', 'are', 'upwards', '20,000', 'more', 'Protestant', 'schisms', 'U.S.', 'alone', 'Luther', 'legacy', 'indeed', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'glibly', 'prophesied', 'complete', 'demise', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', '100', 'years', 'onset', 'Reformation', 'Papist', 'Church', 'nevertheless', 'very', 'day.This', 'not', 'viscious', 'attack', 'Luther', 'Lutherans', 'Protestants', 'something', 'used', 'be', 'only', 'sober', 'reminder', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'what', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'filmed', 'well', 'produced', 'shows', 'end', 'Luther', 'life', 'being', 'quite', 'different', 'what', 'end', 'movie', 'might', 'otherwise', 'lead', 'viewer', 'believe.If', 'Catholics', 'have', 'take', 'lumps', 'extent', 'apologizing', 'albeit', 'legitimate', 'part', 'abuses', 'past', 'then', 'turn-about', 'fair', 'play', 'Protestants', 'should', 'also', 'take', 'theirs', 'problem', 'few', 'Protestants', 'will', 'take', 'objective', 'discerning', 'look', 'Christian', 'history', 'fifteen', 'centuries', 'prior', 'Luther', 'even', 'apparent', 'film', 'turbulent', 'telling', 'destabilizing', 'decades', 'following', 'posting', 'Ninety-Five', 'Theses', 'John', 'Henry', 'Cardinal', 'Newman', 'well-known', '19th', 'century', 'convert', 'Anglicanism', 'so', 'aptly', 'commented', 'go', 'deep', 'history', 'death', 'Protestantism', 'end', 'man', 'days', 'final', 'proof', 'life', 'lived', 'well', 'matter', 'how', 'high-sounding', 'charismatic', 'well', 'received', 'beginnings', 'closer', 'look', 'end', 'Luther', 'life', 'will', 'dispel', 'myth', 'suggested', 'film', 'deceptively', 'triumphant', 'severely', 'truncated', 'biography', 'Father', 'Lutheranism']",N/A

830066,A6FIAB28IS79,B0002C9D9K,Samuel Chell,"[8, 11]","This is the most accessible and cinematic of the four Luther films I've seen.  Like its subject who, let us say, ""edited"" the Church of extraneous sacraments and practices, the film is also quite severe in its editing of Luther's life and theology.  Its primary focus is on Luther's objection to the sale of ""indulgences,"" leading to his insistence on scripture being made available to all readers without the intrusive and frequently exploitive role of the ""visible"" church.  The last 30 minutes of the film hint at the enormous political consequences of Luther's bold stand.With such a  focus, the film is able to concentrate on visuals such as period detail, acting, and even minor but heart-tugging sub-plots, insuring a movie that should be relatively engaging and fast-moving for viewers of every age and ilk.  Joseph Fiennes' lanky Luther doesn't quite match some physical descriptions of the cantankerous German, and his eyes have just a bit too much of the romantic seductiveness of his brother's to suggest the stubborn, often profane (and scatalogical) monk he is portraying.  But he evinces sympathy for his character while suggesting an individual who is driven by single-minded purpose.For me, the greatest incredulity is Luther's total naivete concerning the possible opposition of the Church and the Pope to his exposure of corruption (as if Woodward and Bernstein would go directly to the White House with Deep Throat's revelations, expecting to be received there as national heroes!). The most glaring omission is any serious reference to ""faith"" in a film about a thinker whose name is synonymous with the word.  The 1950's movie with Niall MacGinniss, however ""boring"" by today's standards, is more informative and intelligent because it dosn't flinch from bringing out one of Luther's greatest strengths: his use of language (credit MacGinniss' Olivier-like eloquence as well).The most provocative moment in the present film for today's viewer is likely to occur when a Roman ecclesiastic defends the Church's practice of saving souls in exchange for money, insisting it gives great comfort to the downtrodden.  Furthermore, the cleric says, the common folk cannot be trusted to interpret scripture on their own.  As an observer of many modern-day Christianities, Christian cults and wacky ""readings"" of scripture, as well as a teacher of literature, I confess I found myself quite sympathetic with the Church's position (which is not to say I wouldn't support Luther's--it's one of the ""trade-offs"" that go with freedom and the empowerment of the individual).  For an entertaining, candid, at times penetrating dramatization of a recovering Catholic's direct encounter with the Bible, see the books and one-woman show by former SNL star Julia Sweeney).The best ""Luther,"" in my mind, is still John Osborne's, even though it's less a movie than a ""filmed play"" (but out of print and no longer available on Amazon).  Osborne takes us into the inner consciousness of a character who was tormented and tortured and whose epiphany about faith is a visceral experience (literally) shared by the spectator.  Osborne's ""Luther,"" on the other hand, doesn't include Peter Ustinov, who almost steals the show in this most recent version.",4,Latest attempt to film Luther's words about the Word,1117929600,"06 5, 2005",2005,3247,"['most', 'accessible', 'cinematic', 'four', 'Luther', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'subject', 'who', 'let', 'say', 'edited', 'Church', 'extraneous', 'sacraments', 'practices', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'severe', 'editing', 'Luther', 'life', 'theology', 'primary', 'focus', 'Luther', 'objection', 'sale', 'indulgences', 'leading', 'insistence', 'scripture', 'being', 'made', 'available', 'readers', 'intrusive', 'frequently', 'exploitive', 'role', 'visible', 'church', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'hint', 'enormous', 'political', 'consequences', 'Luther', 'bold', 'stand.With', 'focus', 'film', 'able', 'concentrate', 'visuals', 'such', 'period', 'detail', 'acting', 'even', 'minor', 'heart-tugging', 'sub-plots', 'insuring', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'relatively', 'engaging', 'fast-moving', 'viewers', 'age', 'ilk', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'lanky', 'Luther', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'physical', 'descriptions', 'cantankerous', 'German', 'eyes', 'have', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'romantic', 'seductiveness', 'brother', 'suggest', 'stubborn', 'often', 'profane', 'scatalogical', 'monk', 'portraying', 'sympathy', 'character', 'suggesting', 'individual', 'who', 'driven', 'single-minded', 'purpose.For', 'greatest', 'incredulity', 'Luther', 'total', 'naivete', 'concerning', 'possible', 'opposition', 'Church', 'Pope', 'exposure', 'corruption', 'Woodward', 'Bernstein', 'would', 'go', 'directly', 'White', 'House', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'revelations', 'expecting', 'be', 'received', 'there', 'national', 'heroes', 'most', 'glaring', 'omission', 'serious', 'reference', 'faith', 'film', 'thinker', 'name', 'synonymous', 'word', '1950', 'movie', 'Niall', 'MacGinniss', 'however', 'boring', 'today', 'standards', 'more', 'informative', 'intelligent', 'dos', ""n't"", 'flinch', 'bringing', 'out', 'one', 'Luther', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'use', 'language', 'credit', 'MacGinniss', 'Olivier-like', 'eloquence', 'well', 'most', 'provocative', 'moment', 'present', 'film', 'today', 'viewer', 'likely', 'occur', 'when', 'Roman', 'ecclesiastic', 'Church', 'practice', 'saving', 'souls', 'exchange', 'money', 'insisting', 'great', 'comfort', 'downtrodden', 'Furthermore', 'cleric', 'common', 'folk', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'trusted', 'interpret', 'scripture', 'own', 'observer', 'many', 'modern-day', 'Christianities', 'Christian', 'cults', 'wacky', 'readings', 'scripture', 'as', 'well', 'teacher', 'literature', 'confess', 'found', 'quite', 'sympathetic', 'Church', 'position', 'not', 'say', 'would', ""n't"", 'support', 'Luther', 'one', 'trade-offs', 'go', 'freedom', 'empowerment', 'individual', 'entertaining', 'candid', 'times', 'penetrating', 'dramatization', 'recovering', 'Catholic', 'direct', 'encounter', 'Bible', 'see', 'books', 'one-woman', 'show', 'former', 'SNL', 'star', 'Julia', 'Sweeney', '.The', 'best', 'Luther', 'mind', 'still', 'John', 'Osborne', 'even', 'less', 'movie', 'filmed', 'play', 'print', 'longer', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Osborne', 'inner', 'consciousness', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'tormented', 'tortured', 'epiphany', 'faith', 'visceral', 'experience', 'literally', 'shared', 'spectator', 'Osborne', 'Luther', 'other', 'hand', ""n't"", 'include', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'who', 'almost', 'show', 'most', 'recent', 'version']",N/A

And so it is that this one is favorable to Dr. Martin Luther.  However, at times it is so slanted as to be historically inaccurate and theologically dishonest.  There was much praiseworthy in Dr. Luther insofar as he sought truth.  Would that more of his biographers would seeking truth as seriously.For instance, this film implies very strongly (as have many Protestants) that Luther's German translation of the New Testament was the first of its kind.  It was not.  There were previous and better German translations before Luther.  And the primary reason the Church opposed Luther's translation was not because it was a German translation - but because it was a very poor translation slanted to justify his own theological presuppositions.  As an example, Luther insisted on adding the word ""alone,"" as in ""faith alone"" where it did not appear in any of the manuscripts for Romans 3:28.Misrepresentation of the Church and her authority in favor of a stubborn and arrogant insistence that personal interpretation is justified by scripture is another slant.  We are encouraged to lift our heads high in Luther's response that he will only be ""convinced from sacred scripture"" yet never reminded that Luther defined ""sacred scripture"" as only those portions of scripture that supported his theological assertions - putting the cart before the horse as it were.  Not only did his followers reject the Deuterocanonical books (seeWhy Catholic Bibles Are Bigger: The Untold Story of the Lost Books of the Protestant Bible) but Luther himself notoriously questioned the canonicity of James (see the RSV translation of James 2:24 for a hint why).  His true vision was not ""scripture alone"" but ""Luther alone,"" leading us to wonder if perhaps the film might be as easily titled, ""The Man Who Would be Pope.""Admirers of Luther may enjoy this film but depth of understanding will lead us elsewhere for a better biographical study and a deeper understanding of theReformation.

830072,A6R8XUE6MJLMC,B0002C9D9K,Stuart Winer,"[6, 9]","I enjoyed this movie very much. It's describes the beginning of the great schism Luther caused in religion and politics, which were closely related, in 16th century Europe.  It was a very lofty, ambitious goal and the filmakers were generally successful.The abuse of religion is a very sophisticated and ugly form of enslavement, and the struggle for freedom from these sorts of constraints is usually too complex for film, all the more reason to look closely at this work.The major point here, which they are expressing indirectly through biography is about how faith should be expressed.  It boils down to two sides of a coin: Faith vs. Works. Catholicism at the time stressed Works, but since rich men could 'contribute (Work) more, the system guaranteed the wealthy the short-line into Heaven.  It was taken to a corrupt extreme.  The opposite view which Luther taught, was Faith as it's own virtue, worthy of salvation.  Luther's reaction was natural and he represented the sensibility of millions of people.Of course the Faith side of the coin was (and still is) also subject to corruption - i.e. - if you have faith, then works are unecessary, so one can skip helping the needy, etc. But that's another topic.I appreciated the excellent period detail and the fine dialogue and discussion of the political nuances.  Of course everything had to be simplified to fit within 2 hours, but they still presented the key theological points clearly and with with earnest passion.I felt the producers were very sincere in their intentions and if perhaps they were at times a bit obvious in their presentation, this was a forgivable flaw.On the other hand, Luther was not the saint he was portrayed here.  He was famously anti-Semitic.  At times he was enthralled by the violence around him and called for more bloodshed and he didn't necessarily love the peasants like we see here..he was alligned with the local nobility against the Catholic heirarchy.  And those nobility had other reasons for breaking with Rome - they wanted Papal properties and revenue streams for themselves.  So they weren't 100% with the angels as it appears here.Luther himself was a mixed bag.  In fact he was a very eccentric, difficult curmudgeon in later life.  If he did have a hint of the divine in him it was only a part of the whole.Now the producers/underwriters of this movie is a Lutheran foundation..so one might call this a sort of whitewash, or as a sermon disguised as a movie..and I think that's unfortunately somewhat true.  Yet on balance I thought this project was a great success because in a world of junk movies this was about something deep and important and was a valuable history lesson.

With these brave words, spoken before his emperor and a prince of his church, Martin Luther refused to back down when accused of heresy, fully knowing that his words could condemn him to a torturous death. This brave, stubborn idealism combined with his natural brilliance to make him a man who changed his world and the course of history, and thus rendered his dramatic life an ideal subject for film. `Luther' does not disappoint as it transforms the story of this remarkable man into a riveting and well done drama.Do not forget, however, that this is a movie, and not history. While it is fairly historically accurate in a general sense, it has taken the liberties that most movies make to simplify, condense, and otherwise alter a tale to create the dramatic story that the film maker wishes to tell. Details that could detract from Luther's status as righteous hero, such as his reaction to the peasant revolt have been glossed over if not fully misrepresented. Likewise, the film clearly shows how political expediency was a corrupting influence within the Catholic Church, but largely ignores the role that it played in the support that the German princes gave to Luther and his reformation.But it is as a movie that `Luther' shines. The sets and costumes are outstanding, believably recreating the atmosphere of 16th century Germany. The acting, likewise, is superb. Joseph Fiennes brings a brooding intensity to the role of Martin Luther that all but makes you forget that he is too handsome for the part. Sir Peter Ustinov is absolutely brilliant with a sly and charming portrayal of Frederick the Wise; a fitting final role for this late, great actor. And though the role of John Tetzel (the indulgence selling preacher) is reduced to a cartoon caricature villain, Alfred Molina still does an excellent job in this small but important part.As Martin Luther is not only the focus but the unabashed hero of this film, its emphasis naturally tilts toward a Protestant view of history, yet it is not nakedly partisan, and should not offend any but the most sensitive of Catholics. `Luther' tells an important and fascinating story, and though it should not be accepted as verbatim history, it may whet your appetite to read further about the history of Martin Luther and the dramatic changes that he made to the course of world and church history. Though not without its faults, `Luther' is a first rate film, and I enthusiastically recommend it.Theo Logos",4,"""I cannot, and I will not recant.

He was truly remarkable in capturing the nuance and personal struggle that we understand to have comprised the life of Martin Luther.  His portrayal was sincere and powerful....he is really a devoted performer and succeeds admirably in a production that could have taken a lesson from his work.  I felt too little was shown of his life up to the pilgrimage to Rome.  According to history from youth onward he suffered from self-esteem issues to a serious level as a result of failing in the expectations of his father.  His vows and move to the monastery after the lightning storm depicted in the opening scene do too little to show the aesthetic life he is believed to have led there (think self-flagellation, dangerous levels of exposure to cold.....a slave like existence....all the things Rome attributed to a dutiful monk)  To overlook this period is to ignore the events that led him to rebel against the falseness, avarice and gluttony of the RC church.  The production values did not feel true to the time.  Remember, that several of Luther's friends during and after the university died of the plague to put the period in perspective.....There was literally little hint of the desperation of the time portrayed. I also felt that to show none of the tension and internal struggle within Luther during the writing of the 95 Theses debased their importance and the risk he took in writing them.  Fiennes demonstrated a knowledge of Luther's life that clearly went far beyond the direction & production of this film.

830080,A26J8PU2MY4OUS,B0002C9D9K,thisisgibbie,"[15, 23]","As a Protestant Christian, I went to see ""Luther"" hoping to see an historic and heroic story. There were some good moments of drama, but contrary to popular opinion here, I must agree with much of the perceptive review by Jesuit Edward Oakes, who wrote the movie review in the January 2004 issue of First Things (you can read it online), in which he states that the movie makers mostly miss the point.The point being that the most significant issue for Martin Luther was salvation of the soul - justification by faith in Christ alone. The provocative issues between Catholic and Evangelical (the broader Evangelical movement known as Protestantism and Evangelische Kirche is the German name for the Lutheran Church) are ""airbrushed"" and meaningfully obfuscated - this is the true divide between Catholic and Protestant and is central to Luther's drama. He is one of the most important people in world history!The movie tries to pull a modern doubting rebel tone on Luther's character, which was not him. He was socially quite conservative and quite earnest to reform the Catholic Church. While politics did merge with religion, it was in a cultural way that we, today, have mostly lost an understanding of in its Medieval context (aside from all the bad stuff). The failure of tone is shown at the Diet of Worms scene where the conflict ""comes across not as a theological dispute but more like the grilling of a Hollywood director before the House Un-American Activities Committee in the postwar era,"" quoting Oakes. Also confused is the Peasants Rebellion with the Iconoclasic reaction to idols. Cumulatively, this movie fails historically where it's important.I have to say similar for the character of Luther here, as well. Luther was a strong minded individual, though at times full of self doubt, but not of the perpetual doubt that Joseph Fiennes portrays. Also, Luther's demonic possession is contrary to Luther's testimony, though he did claim fighting the devil but not in himself. The main character's doubting without clear resolution is the failure of the heroic in the film.Please note Fiennes and this cast are a collection of fine actors. Where the movie succeeds is in the existential tone of scenery. Though German post-modern nihilism creeps in on occasion (e.g. the Peasant Rebellion massacre is similar to the end of Das Boot in tone). Many of the characters are quite different from the 1953 Martin Luther, which I prefer, but is more of a stage drama. In particular, Niall MacGinnis' Luther is much more comprehensible; Claire Cox' Katherina von Bora is more of a contemporary persona; Bruno Ganz' Johann von Staupitz is more humane than the earlier version; Georg Spalatin, who was Luther's good friend in the older version is a distant observer in this one (though this may have been the beginning of the true story? - St. Paul was actually an oppressor of the early Christian Church before converting); and most comically Peter Ustinov's Frederick the Wise, who is portrayed more as a grasping eccentric. Where the movie reveals the best of Lutheran doctrine is that life and the world are a messy place divided from God and that even Christians are needy of transcendent redemption. The warts and all approach is a good way to view humanity, especially in film and literature.Some standout performances were added by Marco Hofschneider, who portrays the heroic Ulrich and, Jochen Horst, whose Professor Andreas Karlstadt is much better than the older version (I wish they showed more development of both characters).In agreement with Andrew Freborg's review is the terrible omission of Luther's musical side, especially ""Ein Feste Burg (A Mighty Fortress)."" While there were great moments of drama, in the end, this finally sank it for me as a film (this hymn is played at the end of the MacGinnis version with dramatic transformation).They had a great collection of actors and could have woven an excelling performance.

830082,AEYEAH3C78BBZ,B0002C9D9K,Tim Challies,"[112, 117]","I entered the theatre fearing the worst. I saw little reason to expect that a movie being distributed in the mainstream markets would be able to do justice to a character so reviled as Martin Luther. While he is a hero to many, to far more he is a villain - sectarian, racist, arrogant and divisive; a man who tore the Christian world apart and whose legacy remains to this day. I am happy to say that my fears were unfounded. Luther represents the man fairly, portraying him as a reluctant hero and one who, though plagued with doubts about his own abilities, was able to stand firm in the face of fearsome opposition.The scope of the movie is impressive. It begins in 1505 with a young Luther running and crawling through a field, trying desperately to escape a fierce storm, all the while crying out to Saint Anne to save him. It ends twenty five years later, again with Luther in a field, though this time has is rejoicing, for he has just received the news that Emperor Charles V has given in to the German princes and has allowed Protestantism to survive. The movie ends at the beginning of religious tolerance in Germany.The initial pace of the move is frantic. We see Luther giving his life to the service of the church and then nervously performing his first mass. We see him wrestling with his sinfulness and with his perception of an angry, vengeful God. He is assigned a task which takes him to Rome and there his disillusionment with the church grows as he sees brothels for priests and finds that the papacy is little more than a money-making institution. The poorest people in society give the little they have to the church to ransom their loved ones from purgatory. At this point the movie begins to slow its pace. After Luther returns home his Father Superior sends him to Wittenberg to study the Bible and it is there that he begins to realize that relics have no value and that indulgences have no Biblical support. He begins to form the theology that would eventually tear him away from the Catholic Church.From this point on we see him fighting with the church and with his own desire to be an obedient son of the church, but even more to be obedient to the Scriptures which have bound his conscience. Following the Diet of Worms, his popularity explodes among the peasantry. When Luther is whisked away to a safe place by Frederick of Saxony, the Peasant Wars begin and Luther, while first supporting them, soon turns against them. He makes his translation of the Bible in German and eventually meets and marries his wife. The film ends with the meeting at Augsburg where the Princes of Germany reject the papacy and commit to dying rather than submitting again to Roman rule.While the movie's scope is one of its strengths, it also introduces a weakness. It is difficult to do justice to twenty five years that are so significant and so filled with tumultuous events in a mere two hours. Through the film we see most of Luther's most famous moments - the storm that drove him to commit his life to the church, his stand before the Diet of Worms and his constant wrestling with Satan and with himself. Of course we are introduced to Johan Tetzel and his consciousless hawking of indulgences and hear Luther's biting response. However, several significant events are left out. Strangely, we do not see one of his most well-known incidents where, in deep torment, he threw an ink bottle at Satan. The ink stain remains to this day and is quite a popular tourist attraction.Perhaps the greatest weakness in the movie is that we see very little of Luther's theology. This is a strange oversight as Luther was primarily a theologian. We never see him wrestling with Romans and only ever hear one vague presentation of the gospel. No one utters the word ""justification."" Similarly, while we hear one of his hymns in the background, we are never introduced to Luther as musician and songwriter. After watching this movie, one would assume that Luther's stance against Rome was based almost entirely on indulgences. This is much like saying that the U.S. Civil War was fought only over the issue of slavery - it greatly oversimplifies a complex matter. While indulgences were surely a significant factor, there were other important ones that played a critical role. So while the producers did justice to one area, they neglected to give due time to others. Time constraints would have been the determining factor in this, I am sure.The acting, directing and cinematography are solid throughout the movie and do a great job of transporting the viewer to the sixteenth century. Joseph Fiennes with his Shakespearean training was a great choice to play Luther and does a very good job of showing the emotional torment Luther faced. While the other actors also perform their parts well, I would like to make special mention of Peter Ustinov who portrays Frederick of Saxony. It was wonderful to see his growing concern and admiration for Luther and his disappointment in learning that his massive collection of relics was little more than an idolatrous pursuit. One of the movie's best moments was seeing his disgust at this collection of useless trinkets. What once was his pride and joy now brought him shame.The end analysis is that Luther is a good movie and one I highly recommend. I was disappointed that the movie spent little time exploring Luther's theology, but admittedly theology may not make for interesting movies. However, the movie's many strengths by far outweigh its weaknesses. We see a man who was in every way human. He fought with Satan, with God, with his church and with himself, but through it all allowed the Scriptures to guide him and set in motion what would soon become the Protestant faith that we so love. All believers owe Luther a debt of gratitude. I walked out of the movie thanking God for raising up such a man rather than allowing us to continue to flounder in spiritual darkness.",4,A Reluctant Hero,1101081600,"11 22,

Till is a supremely visually unimaginative director - were it not for captions and corruption, you wouldn't know when you were in Rome or Wurtenburg and he unforgiveably makes Luther nailing his declaration on the door look like someone hurriedly putting up a shelf before making a run for the post office - and he isn't exactly helped by a script that can't be said to give John Osborne a run for his money, but ultimately it's such a good yarn that it defies the telling and picks up its own momentum. Of course, that's sometimes at the expense of some of Luther's less P.C. views - at times you definitely get the feeling that this is made by Lutherans, for Lutherans.Joseph Fiennes' performance as the turbulent priest similarly improves with the dialog and the drama (it's hard to muck up ""Here I stand: I can do no other,"" and thankfully he doesn't) but the international cast is variable at best, although Peter Ustinov has fun as Frederick the Wise and Alfred Molina offers a nice line in selling Papal indulgences as the infamous Johann Tetsel.

830085,A3JEV3M4L5R2OL,B0002C9D9K,T. S. C.,"[1, 1]","I have always been interested in history, especially Mediaeval history and ancient history, and actually will buy anything on DVD that is something I can get my teeth into, history-wise, if you will. To be honest, when I saw the price of this film I snapped it up.This is a really good film, and whatever your position or viewpoint, is also a really good piece of entertainment too. I am not an expert on Luther or his beliefs, although like most people I am aware that he really helped kickstart the Reformation by criticising corruption in the practises of Catholicism and the Catholic Church. I have no axe to grind here by the way, I am a Christian but consider myself neither particularly Protestant nor particularly Catholic for that matter.So, the film. Well I thought on balance that it was an excellent film, that put some religious philosophical thought in the mix, but also enough interest for people not particularly transfixed by the history of the Reformation. In short, you don't have to be a theologian or an expert on Luther to watch and to enjoy the film. I suspect that some of Luther's hard edges, and also some rather controversial ideas of his, are gently airbrushed out of the picture but this in no way detracts from the film; what historical film is ever absolutely historically correct anyway? Probably every film about any major historical character is changed slightly, or even extremely, to lend weight to the film and sell it to a modern audience. The past is a foreign country I've heard; they do things differently there.It's certain, whatever your religious viewpoint, whether you are a Catholic or Protestant or even whether you are a Christian or not, that Luther is worthy of serious consideration, not necessarily because he challenged and debased Catholicism particularly, but because he gave free rein to his own misgivings and doubts of what were undoubted corruptions and licence in European religion, Christianity, at the time. He was a thinker and a critic in an age when people didn't seem to think, or were scared to do so for fear of what might happen to them, either in this world or the next. Luther opened up debate about Christian belief, practise and ritual in a way that still speaks to us today.

830088,A1C80B497LCYKA,B0002C9D9K,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[3, 4]","Eric Till (Bonhoeffer: Agent Of Grace) does a good job directing this bio pic of Martin Luther from a script by Camille Thomasson and Bart Gavigan. It is solid filmmaking with no sensational effects. It is acting - period. The time and place are Germany at the beginning of the 16th century, when the Catholic Church was selling indulgences like they were candy. It is also the eve of the Protestant Reformation, a period when it was dangerous to speak one's own mind. But Martin Luther had no problem with that, so his character is enthralling.Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare In Love, Enemy At The Gates) does a fine job playing Luther, as do Jonathan Firth (Victoria And Albert) as Girolamo Aleander, Alfred Molina (Spiderman 2, Frida) as Johann Tetzel, Claire Cox (Eragon) as Katharina von Bora, Peter Ustinov (Jesus Of Nazareth, Topkapi, Billy Budd, Spartacus, Quo Vadis) as Frederick the Wise and Bruno Ganz (Wings Of Desire) as Johann von Saupitz. The production design is strong, with superb cinematography, costumes and sets. It's feel for the period is uncanny.Of course, the story centers around Luther's nailing his 95 Theses to the doors of the Wittenberg Church in 1517. Unfortunately, that scene is so underplayed, you could almost miss realizing what's happening. When Luther goes to nailing, nothing is said to indicate that these are the 95 Theses or that that is the Wittenberg Church. Yet, that is the event upon which the entire movie, Martin Luther's life, and the Protestant Reformation hang.The second most important event is when Luther is standing before the Diet of Worms and is asked to recant his theses and the entire body of his works. That scene is handled very well, and is when Luther utters his famous words, ""Unless I am convinced by Scripture and plain reason - I do not accept the authority of the popes and councils, for they have contradicted each other - my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything for to go against conscience is neither right nor safe. God help me. Amen."" The words, ""Here I stand, God help me, I cannot do otherwise,"" was never said by Luther.For Luther not to do what the Church is asking means not only excommunication but to be burned at the stake. He knows that, so this is a very intense, very important, very courageous moment.Fortunately for Luther, he has become a national hero to the German people, and a favorite of Frederick the Wise. So the Church is hindered from immediately carrying out their plans. Luther goes into hiding, with the help of Frederick, and it is during this period that he writes the German Bible. This further infuriates Church leaders, who ask the Emperor of Germany, Charles V (played with understatement by Torben Liebrecht), to demand that Luther be arrested and burned as an heretic.This is the third great event. Charles calls together his princes and demands that they give him Luther, which they refuse to do by bowing before the Emperor with their heads lowered, indicating that they would rather be beheaded than give up Luther and their new Bible. This is a great scene - my favorite in the film - and shows how important it is that civil authorities support the Word of God in word and action. This is the moment when the Church lost it's tyrannical authority over the state.There are other memorable scenes, like when Luther advises the princes to suppress a civil uprising, in which peasants are looting churches and killing churchmen, and it ends in a bloodbath of thousands, which he never intended. This shows the tremendous influence Luther had. He was a man of his times and a man for all time. His vision and courage helped establish the relationship between church and state that we enjoy today, as well as lay the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation and the giving of the Word of God to all people in their own languages. He helped to end the tyranny of the Church, which at that time fed on the superstitions and ignorance of the people.This was a turning point in history that everyone should be very aware of, making this film essential viewing. The only other film versions of Luther's life that I am aware of are Guy Green's Luther from 1973, starring Stacy Keach, Patrick Magee and Hugh Griffith, and based on John Osborne's play; and Irving Pichel's Martin Luther from 1953, starring Niall MacGinnis, John Ruddock, Pierre Lefevre and Guy Verney. Both are good, but the latter is probably the better.Waitsel Smith",4,GOOD PRODUCTION DESIGN AND ACTING RECREATE PERIOD AND MAN,1180656000,"06 1, 2007",2007,4478,"['Eric', 'Till', 'Bonhoeffer', 'Agent', 'Grace', 'good', 'job', 'directing', 'bio', 'pic', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'script', 'Camille', 'Thomasson', 'Bart', 'Gavigan', 'solid', 'filmmaking', 'sensational', 'effects', 'acting', 'period', 'time', 'place', 'are', 'Germany', 'beginning', '16th', 'century', 'when', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'was', 'selling', 'indulgences', 'were', 'candy', 'also', 'eve', 'Protestant', 'Reformation', 'period', 'when', 'was', 'dangerous', 'speak', 'one', 'own', 'mind', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'had', 'problem', 'character', 'enthralling.Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Enemy', 'Gates', 'fine', 'job', 'playing', 'Luther', 'do', 'Jonathan', 'Firth', 'Victoria', 'Albert', 'Girolamo', 'Aleander', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Spiderman', '2', 'Frida', 'Johann', 'Tetzel', 'Claire', 'Cox', 'Eragon', 'Katharina', 'von', 'Bora', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'Topkapi', 'Billy', 'Budd', 'Spartacus', 'Quo', 'Vadis', 'Frederick', 'Wise', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'Wings', 'Desire', 'Johann', 'von', 'Saupitz', 'production', 'design', 'strong', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'costumes', 'sets', 'feel', 'period', 'uncanny.Of', 'course', 'story', 'centers', 'Luther', 'nailing', '95', 'Theses', 'doors', 'Wittenberg', 'Church', '1517', 'Unfortunately', 'scene', 'so', 'underplayed', 'could', 'almost', 'miss', 'realizing', 'what', 'happening', 'When', 'Luther', 'nailing', 'nothing', 'said', 'indicate', 'are', '95', 'Theses', 'Wittenberg', 'Church', 'event', 'entire', 'movie', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'life', 'Protestant', 'Reformation', 'second', 'most', 'important', 'event', 'when', 'Luther', 'standing', 'Diet', 'Worms', 'asked', 'recant', 'theses', 'entire', 'body', 'works', 'scene', 'handled', 'very', 'well', 'when', 'Luther', 'famous', 'words', 'am', 'convinced', 'Scripture', 'plain', 'reason', 'do', 'not', 'accept', 'authority', 'popes', 'councils', 'have', 'contradicted', 'other', 'conscience', 'captive', 'Word', 'God', 'can', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'recant', 'anything', 'go', 'conscience', 'neither', 'right', 'safe', 'God', 'help', 'Amen', 'words', 'Here', 'stand', 'God', 'help', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'otherwise', 'was', 'never', 'said', 'Luther.For', 'Luther', 'not', 'do', 'what', 'Church', 'asking', 'means', 'not', 'only', 'excommunication', 'be', 'burned', 'stake', 'very', 'intense', 'very', 'important', 'very', 'courageous', 'moment.Fortunately', 'Luther', 'become', 'national', 'hero', 'German', 'people', 'favorite', 'Frederick', 'Wise', 'Church', 'hindered', 'immediately', 'carrying', 'out', 'plans', 'Luther', 'hiding', 'help', 'Frederick', 'period', 'German', 'Bible', 'further', 'Church', 'leaders', 'who', 'ask', 'Emperor', 'Germany', 'Charles', 'V', 'played', 'understatement', 'Torben', 'Liebrecht', 'demand', 'Luther', 'be', 'arrested', 'burned', 'heretic.This', 'third', 'great', 'event', 'Charles', 'together', 'princes', 'demands', 'give', 'Luther', 'refuse', 'do', 'bowing', 'Emperor', 'heads', 'lowered', 'indicating', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'beheaded', 'give', 'up', 'Luther', 'new', 'Bible', 'great', 'scene', 'favorite', 'film', 'how', 'important', 'civil', 'authorities', 'support', 'Word', 'God', 'word', 'action', 'moment', 'when', 'Church', 'lost', 'tyrannical', 'authority', 'state.There', 'are', 'other', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'when', 'Luther', 'princes', 'suppress', 'civil', 'uprising', 'peasants', 'are', 'looting', 'churches', 'killing', 'churchmen', 'bloodbath', 'thousands', 'never', 'intended', 'tremendous', 'influence', 'Luther', 'had', 'was', 'man', 'times', 'man', 'time', 'vision', 'courage', 'helped', 'establish', 'relationship', 'church', 'state', 'enjoy', 'today', 'as', 'well', 'lay', 'groundwork', 'Protestant', 'Reformation', 'giving', 'Word', 'God', 'people', 'own', 'languages', 'helped', 'end', 'tyranny', 'Church', 'time', 'fed', 'superstitions', 'ignorance', 'people.This', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'history', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'aware', 'making', 'film', 'essential', 'viewing', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'versions', 'Luther', 'life', 'am', 'aware', 'are', 'Guy', 'Green', 'Luther', '1973', 'starring', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'Patrick', 'Magee', 'Hugh', 'Griffith', 'based', 'John', 'Osborne', 'play', 'Irving', 'Pichel', 'Martin', 'Luther', '1953', 'starring', 'Niall', 'MacGinnis', 'John', 'Ruddock', 'Pierre', 'Lefevre', 'Guy', 'Verney', 'are', 'good', 'latter', 'probably', 'better.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A

No surpise that it was practically ignored by the media.  This movie, produced by the Lutheran church, does what so many hollywood produced films about Jesus, Luther, and other Christian topics fail so miserably at--it brings the passion and drama of the real event to life.  Put this on your shelf right next to the Gibson's Passion movie.If you are a born again Christian, committed to radical disicipleship and changing the world we live in, this movie will shake you.Joseph Fiennes is truly stunning as Luther.  Although he may or may not remind us of the real Luther personally, he brings life to the passion and fire that drove this man, and the boldness he had for the truth in the face of the worlds greatest powers.It also brings to life in a stunning way the abuses of the Catholic church at that time, and demonstrates why God had to start the Reformation.Some have critiqued this movie for some of the minor historical innaccuracies.  However, they are truly minor.  This film is totally faithful (to the word in some cases) to all of the major points of Luther's history.  I will say that you will enjoy it more if you have a bit of famliarity with Luther's life.  This is because so much is crammed into the 2 short hours.  A good bio of Luther to check out is The Life and Times of Martin Luther by D'aubigne.As a bible school teacher I intend on using this film not just to teach the life of Luther, but also as a case study in the cost and nature of the radical Christian walk, the life of faith, and the danger of dead religion.",5,One of the best films ever made.,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,1621,"['agree', 'others', 'movie', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'made', 'surpise', 'was', 'practically', 'ignored', 'media', 'movie', 'produced', 'Lutheran', 'church', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'hollywood', 'produced', 'films', 'Jesus', 'Luther', 'other', 'Christian', 'topics', 'fail', 'so', 'miserably', 'passion', 'drama', 'real', 'event', 'life', 'Put', 'shelf', 'right', 'next', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'movie.If', 'are', 'born', 'again', 'Christian', 'committed', 'radical', 'disicipleship', 'changing', 'world', 'live', 'movie', 'will', 'shake', 'you.Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'truly', 'stunning', 'Luther', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'remind', 'real', 'Luther', 'personally', 'life', 'passion', 'fire', 'drove', 'man', 'boldness', 'had', 'truth', 'face', 'worlds', 'greatest', 'powers.It', 'also', 'life', 'stunning', 'way', 'abuses', 'Catholic', 'church', 'time', 'why', 'God', 'had', 'start', 'Reformation.Some', 'have', 'critiqued', 'movie', 'minor', 'historical', 'innaccuracies', 'However', 'are', 'truly', 'minor', 'film', 'totally', 'faithful', 'word', 'cases', 'major', 'points', 'Luther', 'history', 'will', 'say', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more', 'have', 'bit', 'famliarity', 'Luther', 'life', 'because', 'so', 'much', 'crammed', '2', 'short', 'hours', 'good', 'bio', 'Luther', 'check', 'out', 'Life', 'Times', 'Martin', 'Luther', ""D'aubigne.As"", 'bible', 'school', 'teacher', 'intend', 'using', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'teach', 'life', 'Luther', 'also', 'case', 'study', 'cost', 'nature', 'radical', 'Christian', 'walk', 'life', 'faith', 'danger', 'dead', 'religion']",N/A
