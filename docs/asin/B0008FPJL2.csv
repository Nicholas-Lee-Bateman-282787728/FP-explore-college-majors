898971,A2VJRRIWONTP9W,B0008FPJL2,"Anime Fan Girl ""animefangirl""","[1, 3]","As a long time fan of the show back to its original airing in Japan nearly a decade ago, I am glad to finally see it in America.  However, most anime fans are purist.  First of all, the name was changed from ""Kodomo No Omocha"" or ""Child's Toy"" to the shortened ""Kodocha"".  Kodocha was the name of the fansubbers who subtitled the series.  So it took me awhile to even realize it was in America.  Second, like everyone else, I noticed the fabulous rock/pop opening sequence from season one was deleted.  This may be because in it, Hayama (Akito) was groping Sana-chan in one scene.  That brings about the bigger problem.  Though the show is hilarious, it also has a tendency to deal with some issues using kids that might make parents uncomfortable.  This may be the reason for some heavy handed changes.  One of the most glaring changes I noticed was dialogue, especially in the dub.  In the original, Sana likes to call her manager her pimp and talk about him like he's her lover because she's too young to understand what is happening when she gives him her money or that he leaves her room after she falls asleep.  Also, when he goes to her room, the mother gives him a strong warning about appropriate behavior that was changed in both the english and japanese versions.  Another change is when Akito's friend helps Sana-chan.  He likes her but Sana thinks he's gay and hits him.  Because they completely changed that conversation, now you don't know that he has a crush on Sana-chan.  Since it comes up again in future episodes, there will probably be even more changes to dialogue.  Still, this treatment of ""Kodocha"", does not lose the heart of both the first episodes of the series or the original OAV.  It is still the tale of how a wacky little girl and her unconventional family are able to help people with serious problems that are not as fortunate.  While I do think it's nice that such a wonderfully entertaining show is now in America, I do hope that producers will allow the original brilliance to show through without any more changes to the story in future DVDs.",4,"It was good, but butchered from the original - animefangirl",1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,2081,"['long', 'time', 'fan', 'show', 'back', 'original', 'airing', 'Japan', 'nearly', 'decade', 'am', 'glad', 'finally', 'see', 'America', 'However', 'most', 'anime', 'fans', 'are', 'purist', 'First', 'all', 'name', 'was', 'changed', 'Kodomo', 'No', 'Omocha', 'Child', 'Toy', 'shortened', 'Kodocha', 'Kodocha', 'was', 'name', 'fansubbers', 'who', 'subtitled', 'series', 'took', 'even', 'realize', 'was', 'America', 'Second', 'everyone', 'else', 'noticed', 'fabulous', 'rock/pop', 'opening', 'sequence', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'deleted', 'may', 'be', 'Hayama', 'Akito', 'was', 'groping', 'Sana-chan', 'one', 'scene', 'bigger', 'problem', 'show', 'hilarious', 'also', 'tendency', 'deal', 'issues', 'using', 'kids', 'might', 'make', 'parents', 'uncomfortable', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'heavy', 'handed', 'changes', 'One', 'most', 'glaring', 'changes', 'noticed', 'was', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'dub', 'original', 'Sana', 'call', 'manager', 'pimp', 'talk', 'lover', 'too', 'young', 'understand', 'what', 'happening', 'when', 'money', 'room', 'asleep', 'Also', 'when', 'room', 'mother', 'strong', 'warning', 'appropriate', 'behavior', 'was', 'changed', 'english', 'japanese', 'versions', 'change', 'when', 'Akito', 'friend', 'Sana-chan', 'Sana', 'gay', 'completely', 'changed', 'conversation', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'crush', 'Sana-chan', 'up', 'again', 'future', 'episodes', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'changes', 'dialogue', 'Still', 'treatment', 'Kodocha', 'not', 'lose', 'heart', 'first', 'episodes', 'series', 'original', 'OAV', 'still', 'tale', 'how', 'wacky', 'little', 'girl', 'unconventional', 'family', 'are', 'able', 'help', 'people', 'serious', 'problems', 'are', 'not', 'fortunate', 'do', 'think', 'nice', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'show', 'now', 'America', 'do', 'hope', 'producers', 'will', 'allow', 'original', 'brilliance', 'show', 'more', 'changes', 'story', 'future', 'DVDs']",Kodocha - School Girl Super Star Vol. 1

However, the second and third disks of this series contain some questionable language.  Therefore, I recommend that parents view each of the first three disks in their entirety before deciding whether to allow children under age 14 to view them.  Please note that the language is not purely gratuitous.  Rather, it is a small part of the plot.  The lead character, Sana, is a rambunctious 11 year old with a habit of using words that she does not fully comprehend.  Further into the story, she is very ubruptly but tastefully corrected.Other than the language issues, the series is quite entertaining and perhaps even educational.",5,"Parents, be advised.",1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,687,"['first', 'disk', 'series', 'suitable', 'ages', 'However', 'second', 'third', 'disks', 'series', 'contain', 'questionable', 'language', 'Therefore', 'recommend', 'parents', 'view', 'first', 'three', 'disks', 'entirety', 'deciding', 'allow', 'children', 'age', '14', 'view', 'Please', 'note', 'language', 'not', 'purely', 'gratuitous', 'Rather', 'small', 'part', 'plot', 'lead', 'character', 'Sana', 'rambunctious', '11', 'year', 'old', 'habit', 'using', 'words', 'not', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'Further', 'story', 'very', 'ubruptly', 'tastefully', 'corrected.Other', 'language', 'issues', 'series', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'perhaps', 'even', 'educational']",Kodocha - School Girl Super Star Vol. 1

You would think that a girl that's a TV star would have a wonderful life. That's true, until she gets to school. Akito Hayama, aka ""the Money Boss"", is causing all sorts of trouble at school. Learning is impossible with all the boys raising hell. Sana hatches a plan to rectify the problem. After her school is a healthy environment, Sana learns more about Akito and his sad living situation. She then decides to turn his life into a happy one.This anime is so off the wall. I haven't seen one quite like this before. It has good animation (for 1996), great voice acting, and a fun soundtrack. I think that my favorite part of this series is Laura Bailey's voice acting job. She does an excellent job. I think it may be one of the better voice acting jobs I've ever heard.There are plenty of cool characters in Kodocha. There is also a good mix of comedy and drama. Although this anime is ridiculous most of the time, it does have some serious situations, and some dramatic moments. It's totally fun. It's a shame that it's so expensive. Most of the time, you can get out of paying a high price for anime if you shop around. Unfortunately, I don't think you can avoid it in this case. I still recommend it, and I think it's a show that every anime fan can enjoy.",5,Let's Get Happy!,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,1334,"['Sana', '11-year-old', 'TV', 'star', 'Her', 'show', 'Child', 'Toy', 'very', 'popular', 'would', 'think', 'girl', 'TV', 'star', 'would', 'have', 'wonderful', 'life', 'true', 'school', 'Akito', 'Hayama', 'Money', 'Boss', 'causing', 'sorts', 'trouble', 'school', 'Learning', 'impossible', 'boys', 'raising', 'hell', 'Sana', 'plan', 'rectify', 'problem', 'school', 'healthy', 'environment', 'Sana', 'more', 'Akito', 'sad', 'living', 'situation', 'then', 'turn', 'life', 'happy', 'one.This', 'anime', 'so', 'wall', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'quite', 'good', 'animation', '1996', 'great', 'voice', 'acting', 'fun', 'soundtrack', 'think', 'favorite', 'part', 'series', 'Laura', 'Bailey', 'voice', 'acting', 'job', 'excellent', 'job', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'voice', 'acting', 'jobs', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard.There', 'are', 'plenty', 'cool', 'characters', 'Kodocha', 'also', 'good', 'mix', 'comedy', 'drama', 'anime', 'ridiculous', 'most', 'time', 'have', 'serious', 'situations', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'totally', 'fun', 'shame', 'so', 'expensive', 'Most', 'time', 'can', 'get', 'paying', 'high', 'price', 'anime', 'shop', 'around', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'avoid', 'case', 'still', 'recommend', 'think', 'show', 'anime', 'fan', 'can', 'enjoy']",Kodocha - School Girl Super Star Vol. 1
