Ignacio Lopez Tarso gives a heartfelt and sincere performance as Macario a hard-working campesino who goes for days without meals in order for his children to eat off his plate, his one dream is to eat a whole turkey by himself without having to share with anyone, his wife seeing how he suffers manages to steal a turkey for him one day and when he goes off to the woods to eat he is accosted by The Devil, God and Death who want a piece of his banquet: Macario refuses to share with The Devil knowing his offer of riches is all smokes and mirrors as well as with God because having suffered hunger for a long time, he knows all God wants is to test him. Death on the other hand he shares half the turkey with seeing as he views the spectre as being as hungry as he is and also in Macario's clever mind since humans can't fight death, he figures if Death wants him he'll stave him off for a few minutes longer while he enjoys the turkey. In exchange for sharing his meal and for making him laugh, Death grants Macario magical water which gives the man the ability to heal but only those that are not yet at Death's door ie if Death is standing by their feet, but if it's their time to go and Death is perched by their head nothing can be done . . . Death warns him to use the gift he bestowed on Macario with caution. After one of Macario's children suffers an accident and Macario is able to heal him with Death's life giving water word spreads like wildfire around the village and soon many others flock to have Macario save their gravely ill loved ones causing Macario and his family notoriety and great success, as well as the local doctor to have a sharp decrease of patients to which the envious man then accuses Macario of practicing withcraft to the Inquisition. The story turns darker from there but all in all this is a riveting tale that holds up pretty well over time and left me wanting to know what happened afterwards to the lives of the characters. The DVD seems to be out of print in the US, but fortunately I was able to get a great copy at a reasonable price imported from Latin America, no special features but in this case the movie is more than enough.",5,A Riveting Tale That Left Me Wanting More,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,2285,"['Macario', 'one', 'mother', 'time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'indeed', 'splendid', 'movie', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Ignacio', 'Lopez', 'Tarso', 'heartfelt', 'sincere', 'performance', 'Macario', 'hard-working', 'campesino', 'who', 'days', 'meals', 'order', 'children', 'eat', 'off', 'plate', 'one', 'dream', 'eat', 'whole', 'turkey', 'having', 'share', 'anyone', 'wife', 'seeing', 'how', 'manages', 'steal', 'turkey', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'woods', 'eat', 'accosted', 'Devil', 'God', 'Death', 'who', 'want', 'piece', 'banquet', 'Macario', 'share', 'Devil', 'knowing', 'offer', 'riches', 'smokes', 'mirrors', 'as', 'well', 'God', 'having', 'suffered', 'hunger', 'long', 'time', 'God', 'test', 'Death', 'other', 'hand', 'shares', 'turkey', 'seeing', 'spectre', 'as', 'being', 'as', 'hungry', 'also', 'Macario', 'clever', 'mind', 'humans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fight', 'death', 'Death', ""'ll"", 'stave', 'off', 'few', 'minutes', 'longer', 'turkey', 'exchange', 'sharing', 'meal', 'making', 'laugh', 'Death', 'grants', 'Macario', 'magical', 'water', 'man', 'ability', 'heal', 'only', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'Death', 'door', 'ie', 'Death', 'standing', 'feet', 'time', 'go', 'Death', 'perched', 'head', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'Death', 'use', 'gift', 'bestowed', 'Macario', 'caution', 'one', 'Macario', 'children', 'accident', 'Macario', 'able', 'heal', 'Death', 'life', 'giving', 'water', 'word', 'wildfire', 'village', 'soon', 'many', 'others', 'flock', 'have', 'Macario', 'save', 'gravely', 'ill', 'loved', 'ones', 'causing', 'Macario', 'family', 'notoriety', 'great', 'success', 'as', 'well', 'local', 'doctor', 'have', 'sharp', 'decrease', 'patients', 'envious', 'man', 'then', 'Macario', 'practicing', 'withcraft', 'Inquisition', 'story', 'darker', 'riveting', 'tale', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'time', 'left', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'afterwards', 'lives', 'characters', 'DVD', 'be', 'print', 'US', 'fortunately', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'great', 'copy', 'reasonable', 'price', 'imported', 'Latin', 'America', 'special', 'features', 'case', 'movie', 'more', 'enough']",N/A
787132,AYFNOHE3IQQ4G,B0000VJFUA,David Evans,"[8, 8]","In this 1960 black-and-white film, a poor Mexican woodcutter named Macario - tired of being hungry every day - swears to his wife that he won't eat again until he can eat an entire turkey by himself. His wife obtains a turkey through exceptional effort, Macario travels to the wilderness to eat it, and is then met by a devil, an angel, and death himself. The rest of the film hinges on the results of those encounters. The plot of the movie is entirely captivating. The portrayals of extreme inequality, with indications of beliefs about how those translate into the afterlife, are intriguing, as well as the image of death and how his power is governed. After watching, my wife and I discussed at length the implications of Macario's choices, the foil between him and his wife, and the uses of power.This film was Mexican film to be nominated for the Academy Award of Best Film in a Foreign Language (it lost to Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring). Next year, on the Day of the Dead (which is when the film takes place), I hope to hold a viewing of Macario.The DVD is basic but fine. The audiotrack is in the original Spanish, and it has subtitles in English and Spanish. It also has a page with mini bios of the major actors in the film.",4,"Excellent, thoughtful film about death and power",1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,1240,"['1960', 'black-and-white', 'film', 'poor', 'Mexican', 'woodcutter', 'named', 'Macario', 'tired', 'being', 'hungry', 'day', 'swears', 'wife', 'wo', ""n't"", 'eat', 'again', 'can', 'eat', 'entire', 'turkey', 'wife', 'turkey', 'exceptional', 'effort', 'Macario', 'wilderness', 'eat', 'then', 'met', 'devil', 'angel', 'death', 'rest', 'film', 'hinges', 'results', 'encounters', 'plot', 'movie', 'entirely', 'captivating', 'portrayals', 'extreme', 'inequality', 'indications', 'beliefs', 'how', 'translate', 'afterlife', 'are', 'intriguing', 'as', 'well', 'image', 'death', 'how', 'power', 'governed', 'watching', 'wife', 'discussed', 'length', 'implications', 'Macario', 'choices', 'foil', 'wife', 'uses', 'power.This', 'film', 'was', 'Mexican', 'film', 'be', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Film', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'lost', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Virgin', 'Spring', 'Next', 'year', 'Day', 'Dead', 'when', 'film', 'place', 'hope', 'hold', 'viewing', 'Macario.The', 'DVD', 'basic', 'fine', 'audiotrack', 'original', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish', 'also', 'page', 'mini', 'bios', 'major', 'actors', 'film']",N/A

In this sense the film is brilliant because reminding Northrop Frye in Fearful Symmetry, ""There are two kind of Cosmology: the designed to understand the world by itself, and those that intends to transform it in the form of the human desire""...The First one is speculative, or intellectual narcissism; but the second is in last instance the supreme goal of the Art, and this film bets for the second choice.Ignacio Lopez Tarso is sublime in this role.

787134,A1GX4R797QZZP8,B0000VJFUA,ixta_coyotl,"[27, 30]","Regarding the film, this is an old Mexican classic released in 1960, a little bit after the Golden era of Mexican cinema, from director Roberto Gavald?n, who also did Flor de Mayo starring American Jack Palance (who performed in Spanish!).  For an American viewer, I would say this film is sort of a Mexican It's A Wonderful Life, only you would watch it every Day of the Dead instead of Christmas.  Its a good film, with touches of surrealism and good old fashion morality (a la Capra), but definitely lacks the shine of earlier Epoca Dorada films.  It shows a slight taint of fifties cornyism as well as the influence of the new medium of television.  But by all means I don't want to sour you on this film.  The cinematography is done by the famed Gabriel Figueroa, and he gets an occasional chance to shine.  If you haven't seen it, you should definitely check it out, especially if you have an interest in M?xico or D?a de los Muertos.Regarding the DVD, I can only say WOW!  This is part of the new apparently Televisa-backed Vive M?xico collection, and the production is first rate.  The image quality is top notch, it has marvelous trailers for other films in the collection including Ahi Est? El Detalle (comedian Cantiflas' most revered film) and El Rapto (an Emilio Fernandez flic with Jorge Negrete and Maria Feliz), and it also has English and Spanish subtitles, which have been lacking on other recent DVDs.  I see that a number of rare classics like Maria Candelaria, Dona Barbara, Bugambilia, La Perla, Salon Mexico, &amp; Los Olvidados have already been released south of the border in this collection, let's hope somebody gets smart and starts selling those up here sooner rather than later.
