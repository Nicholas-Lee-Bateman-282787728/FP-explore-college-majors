Even when I watched this the first time Ephram's behavior was a bit much. Which displays this young actor's great talent. Yes, Andy was VERY WRONG but love for his son is very deep.

The reaction is the continuing release of this series. The complete third season has been announced as a 6 disc set being released on June 15th, 2010. This year continues to be good to fans who have waited a while for their favorite shows to make it to DVD, Daria has been announced as has old favorite sitcom Family Matters. Now Everwood, which suffered poor sales on it's first season release and took a long time to release it's second season only to do so with music changes, is releasing it's third of four seasons in the same style it released it's second. This set will contain the following 22 episodes:1 For Every Action...2 ...There is a Reaction3 Staking Claim4 The Birds and the Batteries5 Sacrifice6 Shoot the Moon7 Best Laid Plans8 The Tipping Point9 The Reflex10 Need to Know11 Complex Guilt12 Giving Up the Girl13 The Perfect Day14 Since You've Been Gone15 Surprise16 A Moment in Manhattan17 Fate Accomplis18 Fallout19 Acceptance20 He Who Hesitates21 Oh the Places You'll Go22 Where the Heart IsVideo is in widescreen and Audio is English Stereo. Subtitle in French and Spanish.This set will definitely have music changes like the second season set did. The only special features you can expect are a blooper/gag reel and some deleted/unaired scenes. At this point I think fans are just happy to be able to own the episodes though.I used to watch this show each week while in high school and look forward to having the chance to watch it again, this time all at once. This is the season that finds Ephram ending up with Amy, Andy struggling with feelings for a patient's wife, neighbor Nina struggling with her feelings for Andy, new Doctor Jake Hartman arriving in town, and Bright struggling to move forward in life after high school. The character of Hannah, Nina's friend's daughter, was also introduced into the series this season (who coincidentally is also the actress, Sarah Drew, who voiced Quinn's friend Stacy on the soon to be released to DVD, Daria Animated Series). Hannah then spent the season developing a sweet crush on Bright only to doubt that he would ever return her feelings. Delia continues to grow up and Andy Brown struggles to raise her as a single father. Also this season, Andy debates keeping a terrible secret from Ephram regarding past girlfriend Madison. Then to round it out Harold and Rose deal with a serious health issue towards the end of the season. That's a lot of stuff happening and it's only the major plot points.This was a great drama that had so many more levels and story telling possibilities to it than your typical teenage drama. In fact I wouldn't even classify this as a teenage drama but as a family drama. This show was less about high school and more about the town of Everwood, the people in it and just life in general. We need television to try and bring us more shows like this one. Fans need to buy this set and make sure we get the fourth and final season released.On an unrelated note, those who loved the down to earth wholesome reality of this show may want to check out NBC's low rated but fan loved series Friday Night Lights, a drama also less about high school or high school football and more about the Texas town of Dillon. The first season of that show was fantastic in a very similar way to Everwood and while the second season lost it's way the third and fourth have brought it right back. They are signed on for a fifth season and more fans could guarantee a sixth. Just throwing that out there, I'd hate to lose another great show too soon.

1238881,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001UHOWYM,Robert Moore,"[54, 55]","First, I have to point out that I'm reviewing Season Three of EVERWOOD.  The other three reviews appear to be of Season Two.  My only guess is that at some point Amazon had this listed as Season Two and changed it.I'm giving Season Three five stars even though I don't think it was quite as good as the previous two seasons.  This could be a perception issue, but Season Three seemed to be slightly melodramatic, slightly more inclined to milk dire situations, a bit more inclined to do ""very special episodes.""  I also found myself getting more irritated with characters than before.  Ephram's meltdown after finding out about why Madison left town was hard to take at times.  And while one of the appeals of the show was its willingness to present Andy Brown as a protagonist with feet of clay, in Season Three he simply makes too many bad decisions and involves himself in too many family crises of his own making.Still, the show continued to be a superior family drama.  While it bordered on soap opera at times, it usually corrected itself and kept the story moving in significant ways.  Why doesn't this qualify as soap opera?  The latter never really goes anywhere.  One of the more important scholarly studies of the genre is entitled STORIES WITHOUT END.  Each story arc in a way establishes a reset and season after season the characters simply waffle around, never really going anywhere significant.  There is a certain arbitrariness to anything that happens to any of the characters and a sense that just about anything could happen to any of them, and that any soap opera character is capable of changes that in real life would be incompatible with the rest of their life history.  But in EVERWOOD only certain behaviors are open to Andy or Harold or Amy or Ephram.  In a soap opera if a character engages in quite extreme behavior is simply belongs to the genre, it is part of its charm.  But if characters in a family drama go too far it is perceived as a fault.I like also that the show is willing to go to some places that make us feel conflicted.  The newly arrived Jake Hartman becomes involved with Andy's next door neighbor Nina, even as we know that Nina is in love with Andy and Andy comes to realize that he has some feelings for Nina.  Andy has a romantic involvement that is intense and highly improper.  We are surprised often, disappointed frequently, and pleased occasionally.  I didn't like everything that happened in Season Three, but the mark of a character driven drama like this is that you come to care for the characters and what happens to them.  In most instances that comes to trump plot, which is secondary.There were some nice guest appearances in Season Three, including Anne Heche in a multi-arc appearance, though my favorite was an uncredited cameo by Treat Williams's HAIR co-star John Savage as a heavily bearded but appreciative patient in the season finale.Season Three has not yet been announced on DVD, but Greg Berlanti has hinted that the chances are good that we will see the final two seasons.  Much of the hold up has been music.  They had to change a great deal of the music in the first two seasons and comparable changes are taking place with additional seasons.  I tend to be pretty tolerant of these kinds of changes.  I'm a practical realist.  NORTHERN EXPOSURE would never have appeared on DVD if the music hadn't been changed.  ALLY MCBEAL took far longer to debut on DVD because it took so long to clear the licensing (probably the only show that had specific music integral to the show is a different Greg Berlanti creation, ELI STONE).  But ALLY MCBEAL is going to sell a heck of a lot of copies than EVERWOOD.  The only chance that EVERWOOD has of coming out on DVD is for it to cut its costs as much as possible.  So, I think there is a good chance that all four seasons of EVERWOOD will appear on DVD, but I also think it inevitable that most of the music will be changed.  And I think that is OK.",5,Another strong season of an excellent show,1252281600,"09 7, 2009",2009,3968,"['First', 'have', 'point', 'out', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'Season', 'Three', 'EVERWOOD', 'other', 'three', 'reviews', 'appear', 'be', 'Season', 'Two', 'only', 'guess', 'point', 'Amazon', 'had', 'listed', 'Season', 'Two', 'changed', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'Season', 'Three', 'five', 'stars', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'could', 'be', 'perception', 'issue', 'Season', 'Three', 'seemed', 'be', 'slightly', 'melodramatic', 'slightly', 'more', 'inclined', 'milk', 'dire', 'situations', 'bit', 'more', 'inclined', 'do', 'very', 'special', 'episodes', 'also', 'found', 'getting', 'more', 'irritated', 'characters', 'before', 'Ephram', 'meltdown', 'finding', 'out', 'why', 'Madison', 'left', 'town', 'was', 'hard', 'take', 'times', 'one', 'appeals', 'show', 'was', 'willingness', 'present', 'Andy', 'Brown', 'protagonist', 'feet', 'clay', 'Season', 'Three', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'bad', 'decisions', 'too', 'many', 'family', 'crises', 'own', 'making.Still', 'show', 'continued', 'be', 'superior', 'family', 'drama', 'bordered', 'soap', 'opera', 'times', 'usually', 'corrected', 'kept', 'story', 'moving', 'significant', 'ways', 'Why', ""n't"", 'qualify', 'soap', 'opera', 'latter', 'never', 'really', 'anywhere', 'One', 'more', 'important', 'scholarly', 'studies', 'genre', 'entitled', 'STORIES', 'WITHOUT', 'END', 'story', 'arc', 'way', 'reset', 'season', 'season', 'characters', 'simply', 'waffle', 'around', 'never', 'really', 'going', 'anywhere', 'significant', 'certain', 'arbitrariness', 'anything', 'characters', 'sense', 'just', 'anything', 'could', 'happen', 'soap', 'opera', 'character', 'capable', 'changes', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'incompatible', 'rest', 'life', 'history', 'EVERWOOD', 'only', 'certain', 'behaviors', 'are', 'open', 'Andy', 'Harold', 'Amy', 'Ephram', 'soap', 'opera', 'character', 'quite', 'extreme', 'behavior', 'simply', 'belongs', 'genre', 'part', 'charm', 'characters', 'family', 'drama', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'perceived', 'fault.I', 'also', 'show', 'willing', 'go', 'places', 'make', 'feel', 'conflicted', 'newly', 'arrived', 'Jake', 'Hartman', 'involved', 'Andy', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Nina', 'even', 'know', 'Nina', 'love', 'Andy', 'Andy', 'realize', 'feelings', 'Nina', 'Andy', 'romantic', 'involvement', 'intense', 'highly', 'improper', 'are', 'surprised', 'often', 'disappointed', 'frequently', 'pleased', 'occasionally', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'everything', 'happened', 'Season', 'Three', 'mark', 'character', 'driven', 'drama', 'come', 'care', 'characters', 'what', 'most', 'instances', 'trump', 'plot', 'were', 'nice', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Season', 'Three', 'including', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'multi-arc', 'appearance', 'favorite', 'was', 'uncredited', 'cameo', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'HAIR', 'co-star', 'John', 'Savage', 'heavily', 'bearded', 'appreciative', 'patient', 'season', 'finale.Season', 'Three', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'announced', 'DVD', 'Greg', 'Berlanti', 'hinted', 'chances', 'are', 'good', 'will', 'see', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'Much', 'hold', 'up', 'been', 'music', 'had', 'change', 'great', 'deal', 'music', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'comparable', 'changes', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'additional', 'seasons', 'tend', 'be', 'pretty', 'tolerant', 'kinds', 'changes', ""'m"", 'practical', 'realist', 'NORTHERN', 'EXPOSURE', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'appeared', 'DVD', 'music', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'changed', 'ALLY', 'MCBEAL', 'took', 'far', 'longer', 'debut', 'DVD', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'clear', 'licensing', 'probably', 'only', 'show', 'had', 'specific', 'music', 'integral', 'show', 'different', 'Greg', 'Berlanti', 'creation', 'ELI', 'STONE', 'ALLY', 'MCBEAL', 'going', 'sell', 'heck', 'lot', 'copies', 'EVERWOOD', 'only', 'chance', 'EVERWOOD', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'cut', 'costs', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'So', 'think', 'good', 'chance', 'four', 'seasons', 'EVERWOOD', 'will', 'appear', 'DVD', 'also', 'think', 'inevitable', 'most', 'music', 'will', 'be', 'changed', 'think', 'OK']",Everwood: Season 3

It's the tale of Dr. Andrew Brown, a recently-widowed brain surgeon from NYC who was left to raise the two children he knows very little about after his wife died.  By the third season, he's felt comfortable uprooting the family to Everwood, CO, fitting in with the small town, and has attempted to form a solid relationship with his kids.  The shame is that the series ended so soon as it was definitely a show that was well written and encompassed a first-rate cast headed by Treat Williams.",5,Great Series That Ended Too Soon,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,618,"['Everwood', 'was', 'one', 'shows', 'was', 'never', 'hit', 'masses', 'shame', 'was', 'excellent', 'series', 'tale', 'Dr.', 'Andrew', 'Brown', 'recently-widowed', 'brain', 'surgeon', 'NYC', 'who', 'was', 'left', 'raise', 'two', 'children', 'very', 'little', 'wife', 'died', 'third', 'season', 'comfortable', 'uprooting', 'family', 'Everwood', 'CO', 'fitting', 'small', 'town', 'attempted', 'form', 'solid', 'relationship', 'kids', 'shame', 'series', 'ended', 'so', 'soon', 'was', 'definitely', 'show', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'encompassed', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'headed', 'Treat', 'Williams']",Everwood: Season 3
