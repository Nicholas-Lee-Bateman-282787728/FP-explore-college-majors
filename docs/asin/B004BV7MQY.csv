1395636,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B004BV7MQY,Annie Van Auken,"[2, 2]","BUYER BEWARE: This review is posted on a page for a DVD set that will NOT work on Region 1 (American only) machines..KANE & ABEL (TV-1985) - 2 DVDs contain a 5-plus-hour miniseries. With Peter Strauss, Sam Neill, Ron Silver, David Dukes, Fred Gwynne, Jill Eikenberry, Richard Anderson.Very high production values here.The twin stories open in 1901. William Kane is born into a wealthy Boston family. Abel Kosnoski's birth on the very same day is more dramatic. His Polish peasant mother has him in the woods, all alone. She dies giving him life. Through a stroke of good fortune and with the help of his way above average scholarly abilities, young Abel is offered a chance to live in the castle-like estate of a local baron if he will assist the man's son with his studies.WWI comes along and with it German invaders. The baron, his family and servants are imprisoned for a couple of years in the basement of his mansion. The man's heir is killed and since Abel (Strauss) is so devoted, he becomes the rich man's adopted son. In 1918, Russian tropps expel the occupying Germans, but Abel's lot is now much worse. He and the basement survivors are taken to Siberia.Meanwhile William Kane )Neill) has a totally different life. Equally gifted, especially in math, he's destined to take over his father's bank. Three years after the elder Kane dies on the Titanic, his widow takes up with a golddigger that William despises. Eventually it's discovered that this user is also still seeing a wealthy widow he was involved with before he met William's mother. She's pregnant with the man's child. Clearly in her 40s, the pregnancy plus grief over knowing her faithless husband has stolen her half million dollar inheritance, cause the former Mrs. Kane to miscarry and die. William threatens to expose his hated stepfather for the phony and cheater that he is if he doresn't immediately get lost, and the older man takes his leave with a promise to exact revenge.In the other story, Abel escapes from Siberia and in a roundabout way he ends up emigrating to America. He meets a young girl on the ship. Both were virgins, but aren't when the voyage is over.William is at Harvard when this occurs, but soon the two young men will meet.Abel settles in NYC and the story really takes off from this point. His rise in the business world is dramatic. It starts when he's a waiter in a five star hotel when he overhears F.W. Woolworth talking about a deal that will make his stock double overnight. Abel calls a broker and invests everything he can in Woolworth's stock. A Texan hotel magnate (Gwynne) who's also at the hotel that evening knows all about Abel's past. He hires the young man to run his Chicago hotel, which is bleeding money from corruption within.Kane and others have dinner at the hotel, to celebrate his graduating from Harvard with high honors, Abel is their waiter...NOTE: all of the above occurs in the first half of the story and merely sets up some excellent later developments.",5,A man of privilege and a privileged man lock financial horns,1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,2988,"['BUYER', 'BEWARE', 'review', 'posted', 'page', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'NOT', 'work', 'Region', '1', 'American', 'only', 'machines..KANE', 'ABEL', 'TV-1985', '2', 'DVDs', 'contain', '5-plus-hour', 'miniseries', 'Peter', 'Strauss', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'David', 'Dukes', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'Jill', 'Eikenberry', 'Richard', 'Anderson.Very', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'here.The', 'twin', 'stories', 'open', '1901', 'William', 'Kane', 'born', 'wealthy', 'Boston', 'family', 'Abel', 'Kosnoski', 'birth', 'very', 'same', 'day', 'more', 'dramatic', 'Polish', 'peasant', 'mother', 'woods', 'alone', 'giving', 'life', 'stroke', 'good', 'fortune', 'help', 'way', 'average', 'scholarly', 'abilities', 'young', 'Abel', 'offered', 'chance', 'live', 'castle-like', 'estate', 'local', 'baron', 'will', 'assist', 'man', 'son', 'studies.WWI', 'along', 'German', 'invaders', 'baron', 'family', 'servants', 'are', 'imprisoned', 'couple', 'years', 'basement', 'mansion', 'man', 'heir', 'killed', 'Abel', 'Strauss', 'so', 'devoted', 'rich', 'man', 'adopted', 'son', '1918', 'Russian', 'tropps', 'expel', 'occupying', 'Germans', 'Abel', 'lot', 'now', 'much', 'worse', 'basement', 'survivors', 'are', 'taken', 'Siberia.Meanwhile', 'William', 'Kane', 'Neill', 'totally', 'different', 'life', 'Equally', 'gifted', 'especially', 'math', 'destined', 'take', 'over', 'father', 'bank', 'Three', 'years', 'elder', 'Kane', 'Titanic', 'widow', 'up', 'golddigger', 'William', 'Eventually', 'discovered', 'user', 'also', 'still', 'seeing', 'wealthy', 'widow', 'was', 'involved', 'met', 'William', 'mother', 'pregnant', 'man', 'child', 'Clearly', '40s', 'pregnancy', 'grief', 'knowing', 'faithless', 'husband', 'stolen', 'half', 'million', 'dollar', 'inheritance', 'cause', 'former', 'Mrs.', 'Kane', 'miscarry', 'die', 'William', 'expose', 'hated', 'stepfather', 'phony', 'cheater', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'get', 'lost', 'older', 'man', 'leave', 'promise', 'exact', 'revenge.In', 'other', 'story', 'Abel', 'Siberia', 'roundabout', 'way', 'up', 'emigrating', 'America', 'young', 'girl', 'ship', 'were', 'virgins', 'are', ""n't"", 'when', 'voyage', 'over.William', 'Harvard', 'when', 'soon', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'will', 'meet.Abel', 'settles', 'NYC', 'story', 'really', 'off', 'point', 'rise', 'business', 'world', 'dramatic', 'when', 'waiter', 'five', 'star', 'hotel', 'when', 'F.W', 'Woolworth', 'talking', 'deal', 'will', 'make', 'stock', 'double', 'overnight', 'Abel', 'broker', 'invests', 'everything', 'can', 'Woolworth', 'stock', 'Texan', 'hotel', 'magnate', 'Gwynne', 'who', 'also', 'hotel', 'evening', 'Abel', 'past', 'young', 'man', 'run', 'Chicago', 'hotel', 'bleeding', 'money', 'corruption', 'within.Kane', 'others', 'have', 'dinner', 'hotel', 'celebrate', 'graduating', 'Harvard', 'high', 'honors', 'Abel', 'waiter', 'NOTE', 'above', 'occurs', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'merely', 'up', 'excellent', 'later', 'developments']",N/A
