396522,AQE41QO3NEUMW,6304021720,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[7, 7]","All around cowboy actor Joel McCrae was a natural pick for this 1946 Hollywood version (the 4th one) of Owen Wister's classic western novel. Conceived as a colorful family-pic, with elements of light-hearted comedy and a few dark shadowy elements, it's not much different in spirit from the musical ""Oklahoma!"" which had been running on Broadway since 1943. Though set on the Wyoming frontier of the 1880s, there's hardly a hint of historical accuracy in the film. Medicine Bow, which Wister describes as no better than squalid, appears here with all the generic splendor of your standard backlot street of storefronts. And the cowboys wear potato-chip brim hats and jeans, with no concern for what a working cowboy might have worn at the time.Scenes are borrowed from earlier versions of the film instead of returning to Wister - for example the way Molly and the Virginian meet. In Wister's novel, the Virginian dramatically rescues Molly from a wagon foundering as it crosses a stream. This film uses a comic scene borrowed from an earlier movie version, where the Virginian saves her from what she believes is a violent cow - trading away excitement for a cheap laugh. Wister shows her vulnerability, while allowing her to maintain her dignity - a big difference. Sonny Tufts' Steve is too slap-happy to be taken seriously as a cattle rustler, though he makes what he can of the scene in which he is hanged after associating with horse thieves.Molly, the schoolmarm from Vermont - a fish out of water on the frontier - is not an easy character to portray sympathetically. She has notions about the superiority of her own New England ways, but there is good reason why she would fail to see the appeal of an unschooled cowboy from a poor Southern family, with no particular redeeming qualities beyond his good looks and his riding and roping skills. Wister made her independent and spirited, which comes across in this and other movie versions as stubbornly shrill. The Goodrich/Hackett screenwriting team make her intelligent and witty in some scenes and vainly shallow in others. Barbara Britton isn't always up to knitting it all together.Brian Donleavy is OK as Trampas - dressed in black, big surprise - but he shows nothing of the inner Iago that drives Wister's villain, who seems driven as much by envy of the Virginian as a wish to serve his own selfish ends on the fringes of the law. What makes Wister's story interesting is the way each tries to outwit the other, from the card-playing scene where they first meet to the final show-down in the street. The tension of that contest is translated here into the standard good-guy vs bad-guy stereotypes we are familiar with from a hundred other western movies. Walter Huston's Trampas in the 1929 version of the film is far more three-dimensional and interesting.Of all the versions of the film, the one from 1929, with a very young Gary Cooper as the Virginian, is arguably the best. Of all the actors who have played the part, he comes closest to Wister's original conception of the man - young, lean, handsome. McCrae, face it, was 40 when he played the part - nearly twice the age of Wister's hero. The 1929 version also includes the baby-switching scene, which reflects more of the young cowboys' ambivalence about marriage, family, and settling down. Showing the playful side of the Virginian (as Wister does), we get a more rounded and less stereotypical portrayal. Like ""Lonesome Dove,"" what the novel needs is a mini-series to bring what is a wonderful story to full life on the screen. Until then, we have these partial successes.",3,Oklahoma! without the songs . . .,1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,3601,"['cowboy', 'actor', 'Joel', 'McCrae', 'was', 'natural', 'pick', '1946', 'Hollywood', 'version', '4th', 'one', 'Owen', 'Wister', 'classic', 'western', 'novel', 'Conceived', 'colorful', 'family-pic', 'elements', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'few', 'dark', 'shadowy', 'elements', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'spirit', 'musical', 'Oklahoma', 'had', 'been', 'running', 'Broadway', '1943', 'Though', 'set', 'Wyoming', 'frontier', '1880s', 'hardly', 'hint', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'Medicine', 'Bow', 'Wister', 'better', 'squalid', 'here', 'generic', 'splendor', 'standard', 'backlot', 'street', 'storefronts', 'cowboys', 'wear', 'potato-chip', 'brim', 'hats', 'jeans', 'concern', 'what', 'working', 'cowboy', 'might', 'have', 'worn', 'time.Scenes', 'are', 'borrowed', 'earlier', 'versions', 'film', 'instead', 'returning', 'Wister', 'example', 'way', 'Molly', 'Virginian', 'meet', 'Wister', 'novel', 'Virginian', 'dramatically', 'Molly', 'wagon', 'foundering', 'stream', 'film', 'comic', 'scene', 'borrowed', 'earlier', 'movie', 'version', 'where', 'Virginian', 'what', 'violent', 'cow', 'trading', 'away', 'excitement', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'Wister', 'vulnerability', 'allowing', 'maintain', 'dignity', 'big', 'difference', 'Sonny', 'Tufts', 'Steve', 'too', 'slap-happy', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'cattle', 'rustler', 'what', 'can', 'scene', 'hanged', 'associating', 'horse', 'thieves.Molly', 'schoolmarm', 'Vermont', 'fish', 'water', 'frontier', 'not', 'easy', 'character', 'portray', 'sympathetically', 'notions', 'superiority', 'own', 'New', 'England', 'ways', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'would', 'fail', 'see', 'appeal', 'unschooled', 'cowboy', 'poor', 'Southern', 'family', 'particular', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'good', 'looks', 'riding', 'roping', 'skills', 'Wister', 'made', 'independent', 'spirited', 'other', 'movie', 'versions', 'stubbornly', 'shrill', 'Goodrich/Hackett', 'screenwriting', 'team', 'make', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'scenes', 'vainly', 'shallow', 'others', 'Barbara', 'Britton', ""n't"", 'always', 'up', 'knitting', 'together.Brian', 'Donleavy', 'OK', 'Trampas', 'dressed', 'black', 'big', 'surprise', 'nothing', 'inner', 'Iago', 'Wister', 'villain', 'who', 'driven', 'much', 'envy', 'Virginian', 'wish', 'serve', 'own', 'selfish', 'ends', 'fringes', 'law', 'What', 'Wister', 'story', 'interesting', 'way', 'tries', 'outwit', 'other', 'card-playing', 'scene', 'where', 'first', 'meet', 'final', 'show-down', 'street', 'tension', 'contest', 'translated', 'here', 'standard', 'good-guy', 'vs', 'bad-guy', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'familiar', 'hundred', 'other', 'western', 'movies', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'Trampas', '1929', 'version', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'three-dimensional', 'interesting.Of', 'versions', 'film', 'one', '1929', 'very', 'young', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Virginian', 'arguably', 'best', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'played', 'part', 'closest', 'Wister', 'original', 'conception', 'man', 'young', 'lean', 'handsome', 'McCrae', 'face', 'was', '40', 'when', 'played', 'part', 'nearly', 'twice', 'age', 'Wister', 'hero', '1929', 'version', 'also', 'baby-switching', 'scene', 'more', 'young', 'cowboys', 'ambivalence', 'marriage', 'family', 'settling', 'down', 'Showing', 'playful', 'side', 'Virginian', 'Wister', 'get', 'more', 'rounded', 'less', 'stereotypical', 'portrayal', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'what', 'novel', 'mini-series', 'bring', 'what', 'wonderful', 'story', 'full', 'life', 'screen', 'then', 'have', 'partial', 'successes']",Owen Wister's The Virginian Universal Western Collection  VHS
