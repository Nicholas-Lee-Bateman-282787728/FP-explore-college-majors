But I have been watching it on Adult Swim of late and I must write a review to speak my bit.This show is just not very good.  Most laughs are groan induced or bitter rather than snickers or outright laughter.  The episodes are also a little dull with not much happening besides the seemingly requisite visit by the landlord, call from the president and visit with the evil doctor on TV.  I didn't think it was funny.  There are, however, a number of shows that are snicker inducing or gut wrenching, The Venture Bros. for one.  So it comes down to this.  I spend thirty minutes watching an episode of Milk Chan.  I could spend those same thirty minutes watching something funnier.  So why not.The same goes for the purchase of this DVD set.  You can take the money you would spend on this DVD and, rather than spend it on something that may at best get a few laughs, buy a DVD that is REALLY funny, like Harvey Birdman, Aqua Team Hunger Force or whatever else really tickles you.  I'm not saying Milk Chan does not have some positive aspects, just that it really isn't worth your time or money.",2,Its a question of time use really...,1100995200,"11 21, 2004",2004,1153,"['Super', 'Milk', 'Chan', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'Japanese', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'late', 'must', 'write', 'review', 'speak', 'bit.This', 'show', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Most', 'laughs', 'are', 'groan', 'induced', 'bitter', 'rather', 'snickers', 'outright', 'laughter', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'little', 'dull', 'not', 'much', 'happening', 'seemingly', 'requisite', 'visit', 'landlord', 'call', 'president', 'visit', 'evil', 'doctor', 'TV', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'funny', 'are', 'however', 'number', 'shows', 'are', 'snicker', 'inducing', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'Venture', 'Bros.', 'one', 'down', 'spend', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'watching', 'episode', 'Milk', 'Chan', 'could', 'spend', 'same', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'watching', 'something', 'funnier', 'So', 'why', 'not.The', 'same', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'set', 'can', 'take', 'money', 'would', 'spend', 'DVD', 'rather', 'spend', 'something', 'may', 'best', 'get', 'few', 'laughs', 'buy', 'DVD', 'REALLY', 'funny', 'Harvey', 'Birdman', 'Aqua', 'Team', 'Hunger', 'Force', 'else', 'really', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Milk', 'Chan', 'not', 'have', 'positive', 'aspects', 'just', 'really', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'money']","The Super Milk Chan Show, Vol. 1 - 100% Whole"
828550,AQZPSAB3OJHXV,B00029NMIG,"Chris Sharp ""stoner_animation""","[7, 9]","Take the basic animation of Ren and Stimpy, add shades of Excel Saga and throw in a pile of useless crude humor and popculture and you get what is knowen as the Super Milk Chan Show. Milk is a 5 yr old super herion who drops f-bombs like a sailor and refuses to pay her bills. He gets hired by the lazy and often &quot;Challanged&quot; president (of everything!) he normaly forgets what he calls milk for and ends up making usless convo with her or sends her on redunat missions. The first dvd set in this four part serries is broken in to two disks. 100% whole is the more crude and americanized verson of the show that has more western pop culture refferances and shows the voice cast as breaks from the cartoon itself. The other disk is the straight from Japan verson with video essays as breaks. Personaly I like the more western verson of the show but dislike the &quot;behind the seceens footage&quot; but you can't win them all. If your really into the the imature and pointless cartoons like I am then I highly suggest this set. However this set is an aquired tatse and you will either love it or hate it there is really no in between on this one. And a side note for my fellow &quot;smoking&quot; friends that shop here. If you think Aqua Teen Hunger Force was a roit then check this one out a few bowls and this show will make you laugh until it hurts",5,This is a great stoner show,1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,1361,"['Take', 'basic', 'animation', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'add', 'shades', 'Excel', 'Saga', 'throw', 'pile', 'useless', 'crude', 'humor', 'popculture', 'get', 'what', 'knowen', 'Super', 'Milk', 'Chan', 'Show', 'Milk', '5', 'yr', 'old', 'super', 'herion', 'who', 'f-bombs', 'sailor', 'pay', 'bills', 'hired', 'lazy', 'often', 'quot', 'Challanged', 'quot', 'president', 'everything', 'forgets', 'what', 'milk', 'up', 'making', 'usless', 'convo', 'redunat', 'missions', 'first', 'dvd', 'set', 'four', 'part', 'serries', 'broken', 'two', 'disks', '100', '%', 'whole', 'more', 'crude', 'americanized', 'verson', 'show', 'more', 'western', 'pop', 'culture', 'refferances', 'voice', 'cast', 'breaks', 'cartoon', 'other', 'disk', 'straight', 'Japan', 'verson', 'video', 'essays', 'breaks', 'Personaly', 'like', 'more', 'western', 'verson', 'show', 'quot', 'seceens', 'footage', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'really', 'imature', 'pointless', 'cartoons', 'am', 'then', 'highly', 'suggest', 'set', 'However', 'set', 'aquired', 'tatse', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'really', 'one', 'side', 'note', 'fellow', 'quot', 'smoking', 'quot', 'shop', 'here', 'think', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'Hunger', 'Force', 'was', 'roit', 'then', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'few', 'bowls', 'show', 'will', 'make']","The Super Milk Chan Show, Vol. 1 - 100% Whole"

If you've gotten to the age where you can't sit through another sitcom or reality show, and have grown a rash of insomnia you could land this show in your lap from Adult swim. With its freshly painted reds, cremes, and blue's, (I assure you there are enough colors portrayed to send you into a fashion of inconsolible gaiety.) you get excited. Or lulled out of your zombie state of slumber. At least that's the hour I watched it! It wasn't one thing that I fell in love with in this show. The American voices seemed to fit, The cursing 5 year old made me giggle, the calamity between the reocurring cast members.
