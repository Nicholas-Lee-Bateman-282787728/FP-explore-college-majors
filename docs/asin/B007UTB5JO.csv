1538261,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B007UTB5JO,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[3, 4]","Late at night on July 13, 1966, Richard Speck entered the 2319 East 100th Street townhouse that was serving as a dormitory for student nurses and took eight women hostages. Over the course of several hours, Speck murdered six of the eight women by either stabbing or strangling them to death. The seventh victim was raped and then strangled. The eighth woman managed to escape by hiding under the bed. Speck must have lost count, as a ninth woman, who was visiting the other women, stayed hidden until the next morning when she yelled out the window for help.The police found a smudged fingerprint that belonged to Speck at the crime scene. The police found Speck only after he attempted suicide at a hotel. Speck was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death on November 22, 1968. On November 21, 1972, a judge reversed the death sentence and re-sentenced him to 400 to 1,200 years in prison. Speck was later given the nickname ""Birdman"" because he kept a pair of sparrows in his cell. Speck died on December 5, 1991 from a heart attack.2319 East 100th Street has become one of the most haunted places in Chicago. The ASYLUM Home Entertainment has recently released their newest horror movie to DVD and Blu-Ray titled100th Street Haunting (The Ghost of Richard Speck)that was filmed in a documentary style in the tradition of theThe Blair Witch Project.In the film a group of paranormal investigators investigated the famous townhouse back in 2010, in which nobody survived the night. The Illinois police release the video footage to the public. The townhouse is surrounded by a metal gate, which locks the investigators inside. Cell phones do not work because of the paranormal activity, leaving them with no way of contacting the outside. They are trained ghost investigators with the latest gizmos and gadgets, and they are all hoping to make contact with a ghost, but unknowingly to them the ghost of Richard Speck is there and he doesn't like outsiders. One by one, the investigators are brutally murdered by unseen Speck.I'm not into documentary style horror films, but it really does work in100 Ghost Street: The Return of Richard Speck. The grainy film helps give them the movie a feel of reality. I've seen many low-budget horrors, in which most have bad acting, but all the actors in 100 Ghost Street give above average performances, making me to actually believe that I was watching real ghost hunters on ""live"" television. What makes the plot freaky is that Richard Speck was actually a real mass-murderer. The house used in the film is not the real 2319 East 100th Street townhouse as I assumed no film company can ever be allowed to film a horror movie there. There are no credits at the end of the movie, making the viewer believe that the movie actually happened, when it is really a fictional horror tale. 100 Ghost Streets proves that you don't have to spend millions of dollars to create a good horror movie. I'm glad that you never actually see Richard Speck, only a few quick ghostly glimpses toward the end. I was pleasantly surprised that I liked the movie for what it was - an old-fashioned horror movie.",5,An Old-Fashioned Horror Movie,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,3128,"['Late', 'night', 'July', '13', '1966', 'Richard', 'Speck', 'entered', '2319', 'East', '100th', 'Street', 'townhouse', 'was', 'serving', 'dormitory', 'student', 'nurses', 'took', 'eight', 'women', 'hostages', 'course', 'several', 'hours', 'Speck', 'murdered', 'six', 'eight', 'women', 'stabbing', 'strangling', 'death', 'seventh', 'victim', 'was', 'raped', 'then', 'strangled', 'eighth', 'woman', 'managed', 'escape', 'hiding', 'bed', 'Speck', 'must', 'have', 'lost', 'count', 'ninth', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'visiting', 'other', 'women', 'stayed', 'hidden', 'next', 'morning', 'when', 'yelled', 'out', 'window', 'help.The', 'police', 'found', 'smudged', 'fingerprint', 'belonged', 'Speck', 'crime', 'scene', 'police', 'found', 'Speck', 'only', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'hotel', 'Speck', 'was', 'tried', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'death', 'November', '22', '1968', 'November', '21', '1972', 'judge', 'reversed', 'death', 'sentence', 're-sentenced', '400', '1,200', 'years', 'prison', 'Speck', 'was', 'later', 'given', 'nickname', 'Birdman', 'kept', 'pair', 'sparrows', 'cell', 'Speck', 'died', 'December', '5', '1991', 'heart', 'attack.2319', 'East', '100th', 'Street', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'haunted', 'places', 'Chicago', 'ASYLUM', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'recently', 'released', 'newest', 'horror', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'titled100th', 'Street', 'Haunting', 'Ghost', 'Richard', 'Speck', 'was', 'filmed', 'documentary', 'style', 'tradition', 'theThe', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project.In', 'film', 'group', 'paranormal', 'investigators', 'investigated', 'famous', 'townhouse', 'back', '2010', 'nobody', 'survived', 'night', 'Illinois', 'police', 'release', 'video', 'footage', 'public', 'townhouse', 'surrounded', 'metal', 'gate', 'investigators', 'Cell', 'phones', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'leaving', 'way', 'contacting', 'outside', 'are', 'trained', 'ghost', 'investigators', 'latest', 'gizmos', 'gadgets', 'are', 'hoping', 'make', 'contact', 'ghost', 'unknowingly', 'ghost', 'Richard', 'Speck', 'there', ""n't"", 'like', 'outsiders', 'One', 'one', 'investigators', 'are', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'unseen', 'Speck.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'documentary', 'style', 'horror', 'films', 'really', 'work', 'in100', 'Ghost', 'Street', 'Return', 'Richard', 'Speck', 'grainy', 'film', 'give', 'movie', 'feel', 'reality', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'low-budget', 'horrors', 'most', 'have', 'bad', 'acting', 'actors', '100', 'Ghost', 'Street', 'give', 'above', 'average', 'performances', 'making', 'actually', 'believe', 'was', 'watching', 'real', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'live', 'television', 'What', 'plot', 'freaky', 'Richard', 'Speck', 'was', 'actually', 'real', 'mass-murderer', 'house', 'used', 'film', 'not', 'real', '2319', 'East', '100th', 'Street', 'townhouse', 'assumed', 'film', 'company', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'allowed', 'film', 'horror', 'movie', 'there', 'are', 'credits', 'end', 'movie', 'making', 'viewer', 'believe', 'movie', 'actually', 'happened', 'when', 'really', 'fictional', 'horror', 'tale', '100', 'Ghost', 'Streets', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'spend', 'millions', 'dollars', 'create', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'Richard', 'Speck', 'only', 'few', 'quick', 'ghostly', 'end', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'liked', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'old-fashioned', 'horror', 'movie']",100th Street Haunting: The Ghost of Richard Speck
1538262,A10NKOMJ8D2OBC,B007UTB5JO,Ivan Closhnovitz XVIII,"[4, 9]","In spite of the other positive reviews of this title, I have to warn anyone who is a TRUE crime fan or a follower of the Richard Speck case and story. This ""film"" is not true in any way shape or form. This is not a real documentary about real ghost hunters trying to make contact with the real ghost of Richard Speck. This ""film"" does NOT really do what it claims to do, nor does it provide any of the ""actual footage"" or documentation that it claims.  The makers of this video specialize in ""Blair Witch Project"" types of stories that are completely fictional and have no basis in truth. All of this is fine, but in this case, it is a very misguided and poorly executed attempt to piggy back off of the noteriety of a true story about a very heinous and gruesome mass murder.First, the ""filmmakers"" claim that this was actual footage shot at the actual site on the far south side of Chicago where Richard Speck stabbed and strangled eight student nurses to death in July, 1966. This is so not true. Again, knowing that this is a fictional tale, it would be excusable if not for the fact that no attempt was made on the filmmaker's part to find a location that at least looks a little bit like the real place where the dastardly deed took place.  Not only is this not filmed at the actual site, they didn't even pick a location that comes anywhere near resembling the actual 3 bedroom townhouse where the actual slaughter occurred. Instead they picked, on their very low  budget, a huge, abandoned, multi-story apartment building, a location that does not bear any similarity whatsoever to the actual site and completely fails to capture the horror of the cramped quarters in which Speck so brutally and viciously murdered those woman so many years ago. It would be no different if someone made a movie about the Manson Family at Spahn Ranch, but shot it in a vacant lot in the Bronx, rather than in a more realistic location in L.A.I won't go into the bad acting on the part of the young group of thespians who attempt to take a very poor script and make something of it. Nor will I waste your time describing the cliched handheld camera shots of dark corridors and water-damaged rooms and ""ooh this is where Speck murdered all those women"" comments from the actors. The story here is inconsequential. Suffice to say, it may be a decent story for 20 year olds who haven't seen all this before, but believe me, this is like ALL of the other ""paranormal"" ""haunted house"" reality-show type pop fiction you've seen time and time again on cable TV if you're over the age of 30.The long and short of this is that this is a fictional horror movie in which a bunch of actors playing ghost-hunters go to a building to try and make contact with a ghost (in this case the ghost of Speck). True crime buffs will find no documentary or educational relevence in this item. Again, I don't have a problem with this, except for the fact that it is marketed as being true and real which is a misleading and cheap way to suck in true crime fans who are interest in the REAL story of Speck and his victims.",1,Waste of time and money.

Overall while the movie isn't bad it just felt to much like a clone of the previous mentioned movie, as you see the cast who are supposed to be a group of would be ghost hunters taping for a show go throughout the supposed site of a dead serial killer looking for ghosts you can't help but think ""Man didn't we just see them in a haunted psychiatric hospital a while back?"".  The effects like with most of these movies isn't going to win any Oscars but overall the director played the scare thrill scenes decently enough to make you jump once or twice.  The actors and actresses in the movie did alright for what the movie was, not the greatest but not horrible either actually some of these actors performed better then what I've seen with some top rated movie stars who got there apparently just by their good lucks and public relation manager.

1538265,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B007UTB5JO,The Piper at the Gates,"[0, 1]","Just from the title alone and reading the synopsis of this film, I knew it had very little chance of being good. First off, I'm a fan of true crime and know the story of Richard Speck. And why in the world would filmmakers choose to turn a story of a real mass murderer into a fake ghost story is beyond me. But even with that being said, if you are going to go that route, at least get your facts straight! Yes, I know this is a work of fiction, but you are basing at least part of your movie on REAL events and people. And though there are too many inaccuracies to mention, the two biggest ones are the number of victims and the location of the killings. Richard Speck killed EIGHT people in a dormitory/townhouse for nurses. The movie repeatedly says seven victims..which makes me cringe. How can you attempt to make a film and not get the most basic information correct? And though the address they mention is right. It wasn't some apartment building/asylum like the one shown. Again, yes, this is fiction, but why not at least attempt to find a location similar to the real place? This film has so little to do with the actual Richard Speck that I don't even understand why they would try to somehow associate it with the crimes. Was it to get more attention to the film? Whatever the case, the filmmakers would have been much better off fictionalizing everything and coming up with an original idea.  As far as the film itself, the acting is pretty much crap, the script is crap, characters are very forgettable, and the effects, at least that of the &#34;ghost&#34; of Richard Speck is almost laughable. The one 'rape' scene looked flat out silly. There's also a complete rip off of The Blair Witch Project, with the &#34;standing in the corner&#34; shot. But even with all that being said, in all honestly, this isn't THAT bad of a film. I wasn't expecting anything great here. Good found footage films are few and far between. But what hurt this film the most for me was all the misinformation and quite honesty, the silliness of the idea of a Richard Speck &#34;ghost story&#34;.",2,A below average found footage film full of mis-information...,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,2089,"['Just', 'title', 'alone', 'reading', 'synopsis', 'film', 'knew', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'chance', 'being', 'good', 'First', ""'m"", 'fan', 'true', 'crime', 'know', 'story', 'Richard', 'Speck', 'why', 'world', 'would', 'filmmakers', 'choose', 'turn', 'story', 'real', 'mass', 'murderer', 'fake', 'ghost', 'story', 'even', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'route', 'least', 'get', 'facts', 'straight', 'Yes', 'know', 'work', 'fiction', 'are', 'basing', 'least', 'part', 'movie', 'REAL', 'events', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'inaccuracies', 'mention', 'two', 'biggest', 'ones', 'are', 'number', 'victims', 'location', 'killings', 'Richard', 'Speck', 'killed', 'EIGHT', 'people', 'dormitory/townhouse', 'nurses', 'movie', 'repeatedly', 'seven', 'victims..which', 'cringe', 'How', 'can', 'attempt', 'make', 'film', 'not', 'get', 'most', 'basic', 'information', 'correct', 'address', 'mention', 'right', 'was', ""n't"", 'apartment', 'building/asylum', 'one', 'shown', 'Again', 'yes', 'fiction', 'why', 'not', 'least', 'attempt', 'find', 'location', 'similar', 'real', 'place', 'film', 'so', 'little', 'do', 'actual', 'Richard', 'Speck', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'try', 'somehow', 'associate', 'crimes', 'Was', 'get', 'more', 'attention', 'film', 'case', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'fictionalizing', 'everything', 'coming', 'up', 'original', 'idea', 'As', 'far', 'film', 'acting', 'pretty', 'much', 'crap', 'script', 'crap', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'forgettable', 'effects', 'least', '34', 'ghost', '34', 'Richard', 'Speck', 'almost', 'laughable', 'one', ""'rape"", 'scene', 'looked', 'flat', 'out', 'silly', 'also', 'complete', 'rip', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', '34', 'standing', 'corner', '34', 'shot', 'even', 'being', 'said', 'honestly', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'bad', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'anything', 'great', 'here', 'Good', 'found', 'footage', 'films', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'what', 'hurt', 'film', 'most', 'was', 'misinformation', 'quite', 'honesty', 'silliness', 'idea', 'Richard', 'Speck', '34', 'ghost', 'story', '34']",100th Street Haunting: The Ghost of Richard Speck
