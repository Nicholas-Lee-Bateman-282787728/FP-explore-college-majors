1112984,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000X1Z0BU,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[8, 9]","'Once' is a movie miracle.  Drawing on the lives of two poor pedestrian people in Dublin, the film is a passionate and whimsical look at making music.  With genuinely good performances, a warm and witty script, and music that comes at you like a flowing stream, 'Once' is winning on every level.'Once,' as in ""Once upon a time,"" he (Glen Hansard)(generically named a guy) meets a gal (Marketa Irglova) (similarly named) on the street.  He is a musician, belting out his own songs at an outdoor mall using a guitar with a gaping hole to accompany him.  At the beginning we find him chasing down a robber who's stolen his guitar case with all his change.  Such is his meager existence.  He hasn't quit his day job, either.  He works at a small, dirty vacuum repair shop when he's not making music.  She stops by him one day and is impressed.  (She throws in a dime, something he has the contumely to acknowledge a few times, yet he doesn't have the money to buy her magazine, either.)  She asks him pointed questions that put him on the spot, but her look and smile are so lovely that he's able to overcome the awkwardness, especially since she at first suits him as being someone she can leave her vacuum with where he performs.  (It's just quirky designs like this that make the movie so effective.)  He gets too forward at one point later, but he softens her interest to find that she, too, lives in a dingy apartment with her daughter, Ivana, who is just a toddler and her mother.  She is from the Czech Republic.  He falls in love, but both find the right notes musically.  She plays the piano and the keyboards, and her voice makes them a perfect match.  Remarkably, the powerfully felt music translates so well, and the purposely amateurish video clips of her show the streamlined fantasy she has become.  So focused is the series of home movies that (thankfully) stick out from MTV videos and makes the latter seem overwrought.  The music, the videos, and the movie sort of melt together into one story and song.  His passion inspires the music, but in every way she brings out the best in him.  Her passion also is in the music, but her inspiration is in many ways the same and different from his.'Once' is truly a departure from other film fare.  At this point, I'll venture to wager it is one the best films of 2007.  After this experience, a good movie like 'Music and Lyrics' seems like a hollow confection in comparison.  (The vast majority of the songs' lyrics are credited to Glen Hansard with one by Maketa Irglova, and a few by familiar artists like Van Morrison--a perfect supplemental choice.)",5,Deeply Moving,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,2611,"[""'Once"", 'movie', 'miracle', 'Drawing', 'lives', 'two', 'poor', 'pedestrian', 'people', 'Dublin', 'film', 'passionate', 'whimsical', 'look', 'making', 'music', 'genuinely', 'good', 'performances', 'warm', 'witty', 'script', 'music', 'like', 'flowing', 'stream', ""'Once"", 'winning', 'level', ""'Once"", 'Once', 'time', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'generically', 'named', 'guy', 'gal', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'similarly', 'named', 'street', 'musician', 'belting', 'out', 'own', 'songs', 'outdoor', 'mall', 'using', 'guitar', 'gaping', 'hole', 'accompany', 'beginning', 'find', 'chasing', 'down', 'robber', 'who', 'stolen', 'guitar', 'case', 'change', 'Such', 'meager', 'existence', ""n't"", 'quit', 'day', 'job', 'either', 'small', 'dirty', 'vacuum', 'repair', 'shop', 'when', 'not', 'making', 'music', 'one', 'day', 'impressed', 'dime', 'something', 'contumely', 'acknowledge', 'few', 'times', 'yet', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'buy', 'magazine', 'either', 'pointed', 'questions', 'put', 'spot', 'look', 'smile', 'are', 'so', 'lovely', 'able', 'overcome', 'awkwardness', 'especially', 'first', 'suits', 'being', 'someone', 'can', 'leave', 'vacuum', 'where', 'just', 'quirky', 'designs', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'effective', 'too', 'forward', 'one', 'point', 'later', 'interest', 'find', 'too', 'dingy', 'apartment', 'daughter', 'Ivana', 'who', 'just', 'toddler', 'mother', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'love', 'find', 'right', 'notes', 'musically', 'piano', 'keyboards', 'voice', 'perfect', 'match', 'Remarkably', 'powerfully', 'felt', 'music', 'translates', 'so', 'well', 'purposely', 'amateurish', 'video', 'clips', 'show', 'streamlined', 'fantasy', 'become', 'So', 'focused', 'series', 'home', 'movies', 'thankfully', 'stick', 'out', 'MTV', 'videos', 'latter', 'seem', 'overwrought', 'music', 'videos', 'movie', 'sort', 'melt', 'together', 'one', 'story', 'song', 'passion', 'music', 'way', 'out', 'best', 'passion', 'also', 'music', 'inspiration', 'many', 'ways', 'same', 'different', ""'Once"", 'truly', 'departure', 'other', 'film', 'fare', 'point', ""'ll"", 'venture', 'wager', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2007', 'experience', 'good', 'movie', ""'Music"", 'Lyrics', 'hollow', 'confection', 'comparison', 'vast', 'majority', 'songs', 'lyrics', 'are', 'credited', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'one', 'Maketa', 'Irglova', 'few', 'familiar', 'artists', 'Van', 'Morrison', 'perfect', 'supplemental', 'choice']",Once

1112988,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000X1Z0BU,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","When Two Worlds Collide-Updated October 2013Everybody, everybody who lives in cities, or who takes public transportation to the city has seen some straggly, snarling, struggling guy playing guitar, playing it well or poorly but playing it to rise above the din of city noises, and singing. Singing covers of some popular tunes, some tunes which will get we damn busy heads down travelers already late for something to listen up for a minute. Singing and strumming, well or poorly, but always with an open guitar case in for the ""thank you kindly"" donation that allows him to survive, to breathe, to write his lonely ballads, and to keep the wolves (read: landlord and other bill collectors) from his door. What you probably didn't know, unless of course you are among the seven people in the world who still listens to and supports folk music, roots music, street music or whatever you want to call it,  that those nameless guys (and gals) have stories to tell. Have the usual array of problems and dreams like the rest of us.Problems like love, marriage, kids, lost ones, and dreams of making it off the streets and into the music studios and then... That back story, both the problems and the dream parts, are what drives this film under review, Once, about the connection, for a moment in time as it turned out, between a guy street musician in Dublin (that`s in Ireland for the heathens and an immigrant girl wannabe musician (immigrant in the days when, for a minute, Ireland stopped being a place to get bloody well out of going across the sea to Liverpool or across the pond to Amerikee and was a place to go to for dreams).Under normal circumstance such a boy meets girl saga, would seemingly pose no problems for them getting together. There would almost have to be (and was) a natural attraction. But that is where the back story gets complicated, complicated just like for the rest of us. First off the guy was still pining away for his muse-girlfriend (Irish) who betrayed him with another lover and who was off in London. Secondly the girl, a Czech national, was married, married with a child, a little girl, (and with a mother in tow) whose estranged husband is back in the Czech Republic. What draws them together is the love of music. His rough-hewn plainsongs of sorrow and lost and her more delicate wistful attempts to make sense of a world through song (and piano) that is kind of passing her by.But to the music, the all- consuming music that is really the star of this film since a great deal of its time is spent with the pair alternately flirting and creating something like a demo CD to shop around in order to get their big break, the one that will right their lives. That music, which by the way was written and sung by the actors who played the boy and girl (Glen Hansard and  Marketa Irglova), gets a lot of work-out here as he or she will burst into song at command. But in the end the two worlds, the world of the muse-driven (and career-driven as well) Irishman and a young immigrant woman looking for a father for her daughter as well as the music just couldn't mix, couldn't stand the huge effort to put those two worlds together. Couldn't stand the collision. As so they went their separate ways.  How is that for a back story of that straggly, snarling, struggling guy you see at that subway stop every workday morning.Original ReviewThis is a quirky film. No question. It provides a very interesting twist in today's international multi-cultural society on the standard boy meets girl theme, and in Dublin no less. It also provides a quirky look at a subject that has always interested me, the trials and tribulations of trying to make ends meet while one is waiting to get one's big chance on the musical scene.As for the boy (Glen Hansard) meets girl (Marketa Irglova)part the two, a strong but sensitive Irish lad trying to go from busker (street singer) to the limelight and a displaced Czech gal (with child and mother in tow) trying to make it on her own in up and coming modern day ""Irish Tiger"" (at least up until the last couple of years) Dublin. The glue that puts them together?  Well, she just happens to be something of a muse- and apparently classically- trained at that. This one and one half hour film centers on that musical collaboration, the possible budding romance between the two, the baggage and drag of their previous lives and something of a surprise at the end. All the while they are making beautiful music together, really just the music folks (for the most part, although some of his singing is a little over the edge for my tastes). What no over-the top, no gratuitous violence to save a fair damsel in distress, no ironic detachment under the stress of modern living?  No. I told you this was a quirky movie.",4,A Muse Of One's Own,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,4776,"['When', 'Two', 'Worlds', 'Collide-Updated', 'October', '2013Everybody', 'everybody', 'who', 'cities', 'who', 'public', 'transportation', 'city', 'seen', 'straggly', 'snarling', 'struggling', 'guy', 'playing', 'guitar', 'playing', 'well', 'poorly', 'playing', 'rise', 'din', 'city', 'noises', 'singing', 'Singing', 'covers', 'popular', 'tunes', 'tunes', 'will', 'get', 'damn', 'busy', 'heads', 'down', 'travelers', 'already', 'late', 'something', 'listen', 'up', 'minute', 'Singing', 'strumming', 'well', 'poorly', 'always', 'open', 'guitar', 'case', 'thank', 'kindly', 'donation', 'survive', 'breathe', 'write', 'lonely', 'ballads', 'keep', 'wolves', 'read', 'landlord', 'other', 'bill', 'collectors', 'door', 'What', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'course', 'are', 'seven', 'people', 'world', 'who', 'still', 'supports', 'folk', 'music', 'roots', 'music', 'street', 'music', 'want', 'call', 'nameless', 'guys', 'gals', 'have', 'stories', 'tell', 'Have', 'usual', 'array', 'problems', 'dreams', 'rest', 'us.Problems', 'love', 'marriage', 'kids', 'lost', 'ones', 'dreams', 'making', 'off', 'streets', 'music', 'studios', 'then', 'back', 'story', 'problems', 'dream', 'parts', 'are', 'what', 'film', 'review', 'Once', 'connection', 'moment', 'time', 'turned', 'out', 'guy', 'street', 'musician', 'Dublin', 's', 'Ireland', 'heathens', 'immigrant', 'girl', 'wannabe', 'musician', 'immigrant', 'days', 'when', 'minute', 'Ireland', 'stopped', 'being', 'place', 'get', 'bloody', 'well', 'going', 'sea', 'Liverpool', 'pond', 'Amerikee', 'was', 'place', 'go', 'dreams', '.Under', 'normal', 'circumstance', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'saga', 'would', 'seemingly', 'pose', 'problems', 'getting', 'together', 'would', 'almost', 'have', 'be', 'was', 'natural', 'attraction', 'where', 'back', 'story', 'complicated', 'complicated', 'just', 'rest', 'First', 'guy', 'was', 'still', 'pining', 'away', 'muse-girlfriend', 'Irish', 'who', 'betrayed', 'lover', 'who', 'was', 'off', 'London', 'Secondly', 'girl', 'Czech', 'national', 'was', 'married', 'married', 'child', 'little', 'girl', 'mother', 'tow', 'estranged', 'husband', 'back', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'What', 'together', 'love', 'music', 'rough-hewn', 'plainsongs', 'sorrow', 'lost', 'more', 'delicate', 'wistful', 'attempts', 'make', 'sense', 'world', 'song', 'piano', 'kind', 'passing', 'by.But', 'music', 'all-', 'consuming', 'music', 'really', 'star', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'spent', 'pair', 'alternately', 'flirting', 'creating', 'something', 'demo', 'CD', 'shop', 'around', 'order', 'get', 'big', 'break', 'one', 'will', 'right', 'lives', 'music', 'way', 'was', 'written', 'sung', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'boy', 'girl', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'lot', 'work-out', 'here', 'will', 'burst', 'song', 'command', 'end', 'two', 'worlds', 'world', 'muse-driven', 'career-driven', 'as', 'well', 'Irishman', 'young', 'immigrant', 'woman', 'looking', 'father', 'daughter', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'mix', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'huge', 'effort', 'put', 'two', 'worlds', 'together', 'Could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'collision', 'went', 'separate', 'ways', 'How', 'back', 'story', 'straggly', 'snarling', 'struggling', 'guy', 'see', 'subway', 'stop', 'workday', 'morning.Original', 'ReviewThis', 'quirky', 'film', 'question', 'very', 'interesting', 'twist', 'today', 'international', 'multi-cultural', 'society', 'standard', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'theme', 'Dublin', 'less', 'also', 'quirky', 'look', 'subject', 'always', 'interested', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'trying', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'one', 'waiting', 'get', 'one', 'big', 'chance', 'musical', 'scene.As', 'boy', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'girl', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'part', 'two', 'strong', 'sensitive', 'Irish', 'lad', 'trying', 'go', 'busker', 'street', 'singer', 'limelight', 'displaced', 'Czech', 'gal', 'child', 'mother', 'tow', 'trying', 'make', 'own', 'coming', 'modern', 'day', 'Irish', 'Tiger', 'least', 'up', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'Dublin', 'glue', 'together', 'Well', 'just', 'be', 'something', 'muse-', 'apparently', 'classically-', 'trained', 'one', 'one', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'centers', 'musical', 'collaboration', 'possible', 'budding', 'romance', 'two', 'baggage', 'drag', 'previous', 'lives', 'something', 'surprise', 'end', 'are', 'making', 'beautiful', 'music', 'together', 'really', 'just', 'music', 'folks', 'most', 'part', 'singing', 'little', 'edge', 'tastes', 'What', 'over-the', 'top', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'save', 'fair', 'damsel', 'distress', 'ironic', 'detachment', 'stress', 'modern', 'living', 'No', 'told', 'was', 'quirky', 'movie']",Once
1112989,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000X1Z0BU,Alistair McHarg,"[19, 19]","This is an almost perfect movie that seems to result from a syzygy; all the stars were aligned in its favor.  Movie aficionados should know that the film was shot in 17 days on a budget of $160,000 and has, as of this writing, generated worldwide gross revenues in excess of $15 million.  The director, John Carney, has little actual film experience, the star, Glen Hansard, is a non-actor musician, and the pivotal co-star, Marketa Irglova, was a 17-year old neophyte when shooting began.  This tells you two things.  First, there is an audience for smart, soulful movies with class that speak (or sing) up to their audience, rather than pander to its basest instincts.  Second, a large production budget does not equal quality.  This breathtaking gem was shot for the cost of the average Burger King commercial.As director Carney points out in one of the bonus features, there is barely a plot.  (He) - a heartbroken Irish busker whose love has fled Dublin for London, encounters (Her), a practical and thoroughly charming Czech immigrant living with mother and daughter - and assorted cousins learning English by watching TV soap operas.  The two form a bond that is grounded in their mutual love of music, care for each other's welfare, attraction that may or may not be romantic, and sheer loneliness.  From the very moment they meet these two appear ideally suited to heal each other in very important ways.The film is so thoroughly immersed in music that it can be thought of as, ""the first musical that doesn't make you want to stick your head in a bag of ferrets.""  The songs grow organically from the story, or vice versa, and never for a second seem forced.  Once rests on the capable shoulders of professional musician and songwriter extraordinaire, Glen Hansard, whose lyrics, strumming, and singing are so intense and powerful as to be just short of unnerving - a big, brave talent.  Marketa Irglova is the perfect counter-point for a man like this, she is small, precious, her piano playing is both careful and exquisite, and her voice is sweet where his is raw.  There is magic in the meeting of these two, even the jaded control booth techy senses it as early on as the first track.Too many grace notes to mention even half of them.  I was transfixed by the long continuous shot of (Her) in sheep slippers and dressing gown walking home from the convenience store late at night, singing her own newly coined lyrics to a melody penned by him.  The broken Hoover trailing down the street behind them like a puppy on a leash was pure inspiration.  Just when I thought the picture would twist into a predictable ending, it didn't, choosing instead something far more satisfying.  This is not merely a movie to watch, but a movie to own, and remove from the shelf on bleak, rainy days, when you need to remember what love feels like.",5,Once Is A Lot,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,2845,"['almost', 'perfect', 'movie', 'result', 'syzygy', 'stars', 'were', 'aligned', 'favor', 'Movie', 'aficionados', 'should', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'shot', '17', 'days', 'budget', '160,000', 'writing', 'generated', 'worldwide', 'gross', 'revenues', 'excess', '15', 'million', 'director', 'John', 'Carney', 'little', 'actual', 'film', 'experience', 'star', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'non-actor', 'musician', 'pivotal', 'co-star', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'was', '17-year', 'old', 'neophyte', 'when', 'shooting', 'began', 'two', 'things', 'First', 'audience', 'smart', 'soulful', 'movies', 'class', 'speak', 'sing', 'audience', 'rather', 'pander', 'basest', 'instincts', 'Second', 'large', 'production', 'budget', 'not', 'equal', 'quality', 'breathtaking', 'gem', 'was', 'shot', 'cost', 'average', 'Burger', 'King', 'commercial.As', 'director', 'Carney', 'out', 'one', 'bonus', 'features', 'barely', 'plot', 'heartbroken', 'Irish', 'busker', 'love', 'fled', 'Dublin', 'London', 'encounters', 'Her', 'practical', 'thoroughly', 'charming', 'Czech', 'immigrant', 'living', 'mother', 'daughter', 'assorted', 'cousins', 'learning', 'English', 'watching', 'TV', 'soap', 'operas', 'two', 'form', 'bond', 'grounded', 'mutual', 'love', 'music', 'care', 'other', 'welfare', 'attraction', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'romantic', 'sheer', 'loneliness', 'very', 'moment', 'meet', 'two', 'appear', 'ideally', 'suited', 'heal', 'other', 'very', 'important', 'ways.The', 'film', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'immersed', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'thought', 'first', 'musical', ""n't"", 'make', 'want', 'stick', 'head', 'bag', 'ferrets', 'songs', 'grow', 'organically', 'story', 'vice', 'versa', 'never', 'second', 'seem', 'forced', 'Once', 'capable', 'shoulders', 'professional', 'musician', 'songwriter', 'extraordinaire', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'lyrics', 'strumming', 'singing', 'are', 'so', 'intense', 'powerful', 'be', 'just', 'short', 'unnerving', 'big', 'brave', 'talent', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'perfect', 'counter-point', 'man', 'small', 'precious', 'piano', 'playing', 'careful', 'exquisite', 'voice', 'sweet', 'where', 'raw', 'magic', 'meeting', 'two', 'even', 'jaded', 'control', 'techy', 'early', 'first', 'track.Too', 'many', 'grace', 'notes', 'mention', 'even', 'half', 'was', 'transfixed', 'long', 'continuous', 'shot', 'sheep', 'slippers', 'dressing', 'gown', 'walking', 'home', 'convenience', 'store', 'late', 'night', 'singing', 'own', 'newly', 'coined', 'lyrics', 'melody', 'penned', 'broken', 'Hoover', 'trailing', 'down', 'street', 'puppy', 'leash', 'was', 'pure', 'inspiration', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'picture', 'would', 'twist', 'predictable', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'choosing', 'instead', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'not', 'merely', 'movie', 'watch', 'movie', 'own', 'remove', 'shelf', 'bleak', 'rainy', 'days', 'when', 'need', 'remember', 'what', 'love', 'feels']",Once

With movies like ""Pirates of the Caribbean 3,"" ""Spider-Man 3,"" ""Shrek the Third,"" ""Transformers,"" ""Fantastic Four 2,"" ""Ocean's Thirteen,"" and ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" it's hard to not be enticed into the studio's lure. But while these seasons come and go, and their neverending advertisements riddle our media, it's easy for most cinematic gems - ones more original and genuine - to fall out of our sights and sadly not be noticed until DVD release, if at all. One such gem is Fox Searchlight's release ""Once,"" starring Glen Hansard (only noticed as the red-headed guitarist Outspan Foster from Alan Parker's 1991 hit,The Commitments (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)) and the beautiful, wistful Czech musician Marketa Irglova (whose voice somewhat resembles Tori Amos ... only Irglova's music is good).Hansard is also known as guitarist and leading man of the music group The Frames (with which director John Carney was bassist), and while he and Irglova have previously teamed up to record ""The Swell Season"" album as well as open for Damien Rice (whom Hansard's music sometimes resembles) on his first tour, their meeting in ""Once"" is so earnest and real that you'd think it was the first time these people had met. I heard most of the movie was shot with a long range lens, thus shooting the actors from afar and giving the movie more of a documentary feel than a fictional film, which works immensely. ""Once"" has such a basic boy-meets-girl storyline but with much more meaning. And it's that simplicity that helps make the overall message of this film so beautiful. The main characters don't even trivialize with stating names; all that matters is the connection these two have - much like that of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy inBefore Sunrise. However, unlike ""Sunrise,"" there is no pretension with these characters, who do more than have romantic feelings toward each other and avoid their rehashings of their pasts. Despite the fact that they're virtually strangers, Hansard and Irglova have faith in each other; something that's sorely lacking in today's society. The two have a wonderful chemistry and I heard that they are/were dating in real life.Set in Dublin, Ireland, ""Once"" is the tale of a guy (Hansard) who's a vacuum repairman at his father's shop by day and a guitarist/busker by afternoons and evenings, trying his best to support his widowed father and get over a break-up with his girlfriend. One night, while performing one of his outstanding, passionate songs (""Say It To Me Now""), he's tipped by and meets a Czech girl (Irglova), who's amazed by his song and becomes somewhat of a fan. The next day, when bringing the guy her vacuum to repair, we learn that the girl is somewhat of a musician herself - she was trained by her father to be a damn good pianist. Shortly after, the two stop by a music shop where the girl plays piano for him and he soon is taking out one of his original songs for them to both sing. What follows is a simplistic-yet-magical scene set to a beautifully haunting song, ""Falling Slowly,"" where these characters bond. Without mincing words, this song is absolutely beautiful and brilliant! And it's a good precursor of what to expect from this film.With many critics describing this movie as a musical, or as director Carney described it: a ""video album,"" it's easy to agree because the film's music is featured so prominently and is played to help form and mold the characters. At times, ""Once"" feels a bit like an epic music video, but with much more feeling and story. Each time a song comes on, you feel more drawn to these characters, their lives and the connection they have. If you don't like the music, then there's something seriously wrong with your taste and you should probably start reevaluating what you consider to be good, real music.I won't disclose any more of the film or the several scenes I loved as I'm afraid that may take away from the visceral, feelgood emotions they invoke. All I will say is that ""Once"" is one of the best, innovative films I've seen in a long time. It's emotionally honest, the music is better than anything you'll hear on mainstream contemporary radio, and it'll leave you feeling both inspired and rejuvenated. This is not merely a film to see; it's a film to experience! There're so many emotions and memories that surface after viewing this film and that's the sign of a great movie! I have to admit that while I'll be among the masses going to see ""Live Free of Die Hard,"" the chance of me buying that movie on DVD is a lot more slim compared to my excitement in buying ""Once"" on DVD for multiple viewings! Between Hansard's humility and Irglova's charm, it's easy to fall in love with ""Once"" more than its title invokes.Sadly, because it's an independent film, you may have problems locating a theater where it's playing - which is a shame because, really, how many showings do we need of ""Pirates of the Caribbean 3"" or ""Ocean's Thirteen""? But if you do notice ""Once"" on Netflix or at your local movie rental store, make it a top priority to see this film! Drop everything and just see it. Afterward, I'll even bet that you'll then soon be visiting a music store and buying the outstanding soundtrack or the duo's great preceding albumThe Swell Season.",5,Once is never enough when it comes

1112994,A10NCNSS7PN93P,B000X1Z0BU,"Andrew ""andyp1986""","[8, 11]","Now don't get me wrong, my two-star rating has nothing to do with the movie itself. Once was easily one of the best movies I saw last year, it is definitely one of the finest and most moving musicals I've ever seen, and has some of the finest music you will ever hear. My frustration lies in the U.S. DVD version of the film, specifically its audio.I received Once as a Christmas present last year shortly after it came out on DVD. I went to watch it again and immediately realized the audio playback was wrong. It was half a step too slow, so all the songs were out of key and the voices sounded somewhat lower than when I first saw the film. I tried other DVD players and got the same result.So I was disappointed, but I assumed that since the DVD had just been released this had just been an error in DVD authoring. Many DVDs have had to be recalled or reissued because of a glitch or mistake of some kind. So nine months later, the DVD is still circulating well and the movie is even being shown on HBO (and played perfectly in tune to boot), so I finally head back out and buy a fresh new copy of the DVD...and get the same result. The audio is still wrong, still flat, there are other DVD formats, a CD soundtrack and a TV broadcasting of the film offering sound evidence of an audio discrepancy, but nothing has been done about it.This is why I'm so frustrated. I love Once, and I want to see it in its finest musical form. Too bad I live in the U.S. which just happens to get the short end of the stick in the audio playback department. My advice to any other U.S. viewers, watch the movie on HBO or watch the DVD on one of those players in which you can actually adjust the audio pitch on the disc playback by half steps. Or just hope that the DVD is some day rereleased and something is finally done about this.

1112995,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000X1Z0BU,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","There's something pure about `Once'.  Instead of taking the route of most films in this genre it steers away from the drugs and immoral clich&eacute;s of musician pieces and focuses on the passion behind the music, the experiences and emotions that drive these two individuals to create beautiful music together.  `Once' is truly a one of a kid film, a beautiful and mesmerizing musical journey that comes only once in a great while.The story told is that of your classic boy meets girl story (or `guy' meets girl story) where we are introduced to a young man who plays music on the streets for money and fixes vacuums in his fathers shop, as well as a young girl who has a broken vacuum and a love for music.  They meet by chance but share a connection that no words can put into perspective for the audience.  It's through their music though that their connection is made manifest.  They are drawn to each other and we are drawn to them.  They fall in love, but a love that is not like most experienced in the cinema today, this is a pure love, a love of character and emotion, a love of human beings and not carnal desire.  This guy falls for this girl and she likewise falls for him because they share a common bond you don't share with just anyone.The film takes place over the course of a week where are two companions decide to make a record together.  They buy the studio time, they rehearse and then ultimately they record their album.  That is your story, but the story runs so much deeper than that.  When I watched `Dreamgirls' last year I was fortified in my belief that singing can be the purest for of acting, but `Once' takes the feeling of `Dreamgirls' and carries it much further.  When we watch actors (and real life musicians) Glen Hansard and Marketa Iglova sing their songs (songs they themselves have written) we feel every ounce of emotion.  We feel compelled to respond to their calls, they pleads; their desires.  We are taken deep into their souls.One thing to notice when watching `Once' is that neither our main actor or our main actress is given a name.  This to me makes it all the more relatable.  These two could be anyone in the world, they could be you or I or our friends.  By not giving them a title other than `guy' and `girl' they become even more understandable and accessible.  I truly adore this aspect of the film.As a longstanding fan of the Irish pub music made popular by the amazingly talented Damien Rice I was thrilled to see Glen Hansard do this film.  His musical style is breathtaking and warm and he delivers a very strong performance for someone who is not a quote-unquote `actor'.  Marketa Irglova also delivers beautifully.  Both are very natural and convincing, portraying real people, no gimmicks or dramatized emotions.  They add to the pure quality I mentioned on the outset.  This movie feels real; it feels natural and graceful and in the end attains all my respect and admiration.  One of the best films of the year, most definitely.",5,You'll fall hard for this beautiful film...,1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,2996,"['something', 'pure', 'Once', 'Instead', 'taking', 'route', 'most', 'films', 'genre', 'away', 'drugs', 'immoral', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'musician', 'pieces', 'focuses', 'passion', 'music', 'experiences', 'emotions', 'drive', 'two', 'individuals', 'create', 'beautiful', 'music', 'together', 'Once', 'truly', 'one', 'kid', 'film', 'beautiful', 'mesmerizing', 'musical', 'journey', 'only', 'once', 'great', 'while.The', 'story', 'told', 'classic', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'story', 'guy', 'meets', 'girl', 'story', 'where', 'are', 'introduced', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'music', 'streets', 'money', 'fixes', 'vacuums', 'fathers', 'shop', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'broken', 'vacuum', 'love', 'music', 'meet', 'chance', 'share', 'connection', 'words', 'can', 'put', 'perspective', 'audience', 'music', 'connection', 'made', 'manifest', 'are', 'drawn', 'other', 'are', 'drawn', 'fall', 'love', 'love', 'not', 'most', 'experienced', 'cinema', 'today', 'pure', 'love', 'love', 'character', 'emotion', 'love', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'carnal', 'desire', 'guy', 'girl', 'likewise', 'share', 'common', 'bond', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'just', 'anyone.The', 'film', 'place', 'course', 'week', 'where', 'are', 'two', 'companions', 'decide', 'make', 'record', 'together', 'buy', 'studio', 'time', 'rehearse', 'then', 'ultimately', 'record', 'album', 'story', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'deeper', 'When', 'watched', 'Dreamgirls', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'fortified', 'belief', 'singing', 'can', 'be', 'purest', 'acting', 'Once', 'feeling', 'Dreamgirls', 'much', 'further', 'When', 'watch', 'actors', 'real', 'life', 'musicians', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'Marketa', 'Iglova', 'sing', 'songs', 'songs', 'have', 'written', 'feel', 'ounce', 'emotion', 'feel', 'compelled', 'respond', 'calls', 'pleads', 'desires', 'are', 'taken', 'deep', 'souls.One', 'thing', 'notice', 'when', 'watching', 'Once', 'main', 'actor', 'main', 'actress', 'given', 'name', 'more', 'relatable', 'two', 'could', 'be', 'anyone', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'friends', 'not', 'giving', 'title', 'other', 'guy', 'girl', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'understandable', 'accessible', 'truly', 'aspect', 'film.As', 'longstanding', 'fan', 'Irish', 'pub', 'music', 'made', 'popular', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'Damien', 'Rice', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'do', 'film', 'musical', 'style', 'breathtaking', 'warm', 'very', 'strong', 'performance', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'quote-unquote', 'actor', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'also', 'beautifully', 'are', 'very', 'natural', 'convincing', 'portraying', 'real', 'people', 'gimmicks', 'dramatized', 'emotions', 'add', 'pure', 'quality', 'mentioned', 'outset', 'movie', 'real', 'natural', 'graceful', 'end', 'respect', 'admiration', 'One', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'most', 'definitely']",Once

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 3]","With multiple film festival award wins (and a recent Oscar nod) and produced on a shoestring budget (in just 17 days), ONCE is an independent movie marvel. But this isn't what should draw you to it. The draw should be its quirky humor, its incredible music (nearly 2/3 of the film is entirely music), and its intimate portrayal of two people making music while forming a strong bond of friendship.The main actor and actress aren't even given names; there's no reason to as this Guy (played by guitarist extraordinaire Glen Hansard) and Girl (pianist Marketa Irglova) could be anyone off the street. Anyone with an incredible gift for music, that is. Both Guy and Girl work differing jobs than their hearts desire, Guy as a Hoover vacuum cleaner repairman and Girl as a house cleaner. But both have aspirations toward music, Guy more than Girl ...initially. Guy, on his off-time from the Hoover shop, panhandles on a street corner, belting out known songs during the day and his own at night (when no one's around). Girl discovers him and asks him why he doesn't play his own music during the day, and thus starts a series of events that speed this short film to a satisfying conclusion. I say ""speed"" in the sense of how short and sweet the film is, not because it is an action or speedy-type film in any way, shape, or form. In fact, if you were going to ding the film for anything, it would be its pacing. Sometimes achingly slow, the story nearly stalls at several points, but thankfully never falters completely.The music is what makes Once what it is, and rightfully so. This is a story about musical wishes and dreams, and how those dreams should never be let go of no matter what the circumstances. Sometimes it takes a wallop upside the head to get you back to your dreams, and Girl is exactly the smack Guy needed in order to accomplish his. Her enjoyment of his songs and her persistent requests to hear more and more from him drive Guy to higher and higher levels. Although much of Guys' songs are based around a former relationship gone sour, it is Girl that opens his eyes to the fact that he still loves his girlfriend and his music ...and this awakening is all thanks to a platonic relationship with a stunningly pretty Czech (Girl).Although Girl gives Guy what he needs, he too gives her something in return. Both come to understand how important their friendship is and what it will eventually mean to them, even should their dreams fail. Chasing after them no matter what the cost becomes all too evident as the film winds to a close.You can't comment on Once without noting its camera work, too. It is very amateurish, almost as if someone were filming an episode of Wayne's World (in Wayne's basement). But it is the amateurish nature that binds the audience to the characters. You feel like you are the camera, peeking at these peoples' intimate lives from behind this corner or through that window.And the music; it's impressive in the extreme, so much so it got nominated for Best Achievement in Music via the Oscars this year (2008), something of a shock for such a low budget film (much smaller than any previous nominee). Glen Hansard has ""the voice"" and his co-actress, Marketa Iglova, is no slouch either. Both are musical talents that can make you laugh one minute and nearly bring you to tears the next. And since over 60% of the film is music, that's a very good thing.

There he meets up with a Czech immigrant (Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;) they strike up an easy friendship over their love of music and of course, a broken Hoover.Over the next couple of days they share their music, write songs together, and then eventually record an album.  All the while they are building a friendship that borders but never crosses to romance because of his love for an ex and her rocky marriage.The music was written and performed by the actors and the result is magical.  As I sit here typing this review, the songs are happily playing in my head; memorable melodies and haunting lyrics. The credits had barely started rolling when I hopped online to order the soundtrack.  He plays guitar and has a voice that is sexy and powerful.  She plays the piano and has a voice that is sweet and angelic.  Together they are superb.There is something so sensual about really good music, the way every note and word can touch every inch of your soul and take over your heart.  I was literally moved to tears by a few of the songs in this film, not because they were sad, though some were, but because they were so beautiful, so perfect.Every ONCE in a blue moon I will watch a film that will captivate me from the start and stay with me long after it's over.  This is one of those films.  It touched me on so many different levels and evoked so many different emotions and thoughts.  I will watch this movie, listen to its soundtrack, repeatedly, and never tire of it, because it's just that good.The storyline is bittersweet and eloquent; a modern day musical about two people at a crossroads in their lives when they meet.  Each one gives the other one the shoulder and the shove they need to get on with and get what they want out of life.

Also a musical like West Side Story knows how to tell a story and create memorable, unforgettable tunes, weaved around the story that is so great.  I haven't seen West Side Story, but I understand the caliber of the film, trust me.  But as far as the musical numbers in Once go, all I can say is: WHINY MELODIES and PUTRID HARMONIES!  I know they say the musical is dead and there haven't been any good ones in about 40 years since Mary Poppins, but still they should try a lot harder.As far as the comedy part goes, this movie is no Animal House.  What's great in Animal House is that it's a bunch of losers, but they're in a way treated like winners because we identify with them from the very outset of the film.  Who hasn't felt like an outcast and wanted to start a food fight, or put a horse in a classroom, or sabotage a parade?  I know I have.  And John Belushi, at the height of his fame, was outstanding as the fat guy in Animal House.  Also keep your eyes peeled for a cameo by Stephen Furst!

It takes a unique twist on the ""boy meets girl"" dynamic.  If you want to make it comparable to another script it is part Music and Lyrics and part Before Sunrise, but truly this movie stands on it's own.What makes this movie outstanding outside of the phenomenal soundtrack (which are all ORIGINAL songs for this movie ...when was the LAST time you can say that about a contemporary movie??) is the beautiful portrayal of the touching relationship between the man and woman.  For a moment it borders on the clich&eacute; romance but their relationship connects more on the creative level.  Watching these two develop music together is nothing short of magical.  It gave me chills to see how each other's talents just blossomed when they were working together.  The music is unbelievably good.  The lyrics are heartbreaking and the piano and guitar and the harmonizing voices are fantastic.  I was reminded of Joan Biaz, Bob Dylan and Simon and Garfunkel while listening ...again though the comparisons aren't quite right ...it's that different.What I also love is the subtle realism of this movie.  It doesn't have the flashy lights or the BIG dramatics or the drop dead gorgeous actors who hair and make up is so perfect that they look good from any angle.  It was shot creatively but felt almost like a documentary.  It allows you to connect with the situations deeper than any movie.  For example, when the girl was walking the streets up late b/c she just had to finish getting her thoughts down for a song, I was instantly transported back to so many nights when I did that writing down thoughts for papers at college or when I had to figure out my thoughts for a personal conflict and was compelled to walk until I finished.  Everything about the situation felt genuine, from the way she emptied out every remote in the house to how she ran out to the corner store in those ridiculous slippers.  I understood her character on a level I normally don't when watching a movie.I would be remiss not to mention the music again.  I had never heard of either of these artists before watching this movie.  However I didn't feel like it was an unabashed attempt at self promotion.  The story was just as exceptional as the music.If you are looking for a good STORY, wonderful ACTING and excellent MUSIC this is the flick for you.

Fans ofThe Commitments (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)should recognize the guy as he's played by Glen Hansard who played Outspan Foster, the guitar player in Alan Parker's motion picture. He has a great, emotional voice that comes through on the songs that he sings and is reminiscent of Richard Thompson. It gives the music a powerful punch and depth. He plays a character still haunted by a past relationship and this bleeds into his songs. Marketa Irglova brings a quiet, understated charm to her role. It's a wonderfully unaffected performance and the two of them have terrific chemistry together.These two musicians compliment each other well, encouraging each other's musical ideas. Think of this film as The Commitments: Unplugged. Once is one of those rare films where the actors are actually playing their instruments and singing instead of aping along to someone else's music. Hansard and Irglova are the real deal and this only adds to the enjoyment of the film. Once is personal, heartfelt filmmaking at its finest and a world away from the big budget bombast of a film like Dreamgirls.There is an audio commentary by writer/director John Carney and actor/musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Carney tends to dominate this track as he talks about the origins of the film's title. Irglova talks about the challenge of finding her character early on in the shoot. Hansard talks about his days with Carney in the band, The Frames and how he knew that Carney would go on to become a filmmaker.All three also provide a commentary for all of the songs in the film. Hansard says that they did the busking scenes early on a Sunday morning to avoid being recognized. They talk over each musical number, sometimes telling the origin of a song.""Making a Modern Day Musical."" Carney says that audiences have connected with the film because of its personal, intimate approach. Originally, Hansard wasn't going to be in the film but Carney liked the rehearsal footage of him with Irglova.""More Guy, More Girl"" features Carney talking about the initial idea he had for the film. Cast and crew talk about making it with plenty of on-the-set footage which gives some insight into the creative process. Everyone speaks fondly of the filmmaking experience.""Webisodes"" features one of the songs from the film done to really low-tech, stickman drawing animation.",5,The Commitments: Unplugged,1197936000,"12 18, 2007",2007,2394,"['two', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Fans', 'ofThe', 'Commitments', 'Two-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'should', 'recognize', 'guy', 'played', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'who', 'played', 'Outspan', 'Foster', 'guitar', 'player', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'motion', 'picture', 'great', 'emotional', 'voice', 'songs', 'reminiscent', 'Richard', 'Thompson', 'music', 'powerful', 'punch', 'depth', 'character', 'still', 'haunted', 'past', 'relationship', 'songs', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'quiet', 'understated', 'charm', 'role', 'wonderfully', 'unaffected', 'performance', 'two', 'have', 'terrific', 'chemistry', 'together.These', 'two', 'musicians', 'compliment', 'other', 'well', 'encouraging', 'other', 'musical', 'ideas', 'Think', 'film', 'Commitments', 'Unplugged', 'Once', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'where', 'actors', 'are', 'actually', 'playing', 'instruments', 'singing', 'instead', 'aping', 'along', 'someone', 'else', 'music', 'Hansard', 'Irglova', 'are', 'real', 'deal', 'only', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'Once', 'personal', 'heartfelt', 'filmmaking', 'finest', 'world', 'away', 'big', 'budget', 'bombast', 'film', 'Dreamgirls.There', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'John', 'Carney', 'actor/musicians', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'Carney', 'dominate', 'track', 'origins', 'film', 'title', 'Irglova', 'talks', 'challenge', 'finding', 'character', 'early', 'shoot', 'Hansard', 'days', 'Carney', 'band', 'Frames', 'how', 'knew', 'Carney', 'would', 'go', 'become', 'filmmaker.All', 'three', 'also', 'provide', 'commentary', 'songs', 'film', 'Hansard', 'did', 'busking', 'scenes', 'early', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'avoid', 'being', 'recognized', 'talk', 'musical', 'number', 'sometimes', 'telling', 'origin', 'song', 'Making', 'Modern', 'Day', 'Musical', 'Carney', 'audiences', 'have', 'connected', 'film', 'personal', 'intimate', 'approach', 'Originally', 'Hansard', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'film', 'Carney', 'liked', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'Irglova', 'More', 'Guy', 'More', 'Girl', 'Carney', 'talking', 'initial', 'idea', 'had', 'film', 'Cast', 'crew', 'talk', 'making', 'plenty', 'on-the-set', 'footage', 'insight', 'creative', 'process', 'Everyone', 'fondly', 'filmmaking', 'experience', 'Webisodes', 'one', 'songs', 'film', 'done', 'really', 'low-tech', 'stickman', 'drawing', 'animation']",Once

Even with its Dublin-set working-class veneer, the story is basic boy-meets-girl formula, but director/screenwriter John Carney's real-world treatment manages to transcend the conventions, even if only fleetingly, through the aching pop ballads which make up most of the soundtrack and the sincerity of the two leads. The plot focuses on an Irish street musician who plays Van Morrison hits for change during the day but reverts to his original compositions at night. Written for a long-established girlfriend who has moved away to London, his open yearning and musicianship attract the persistent attention of a young Czech girl. Despite his initial hesitation, they bond quickly over his music. There is a lovely scene in a piano shop where he sings and plays his well-worn guitar to one of his songs, a stunning heartbreaker called ""Falling Slowly"", while she tentatively accompanies him on the piano. The story simply goes from one number to the next while uncovering facts about the characters that guide their fate.It's been sixteen years since his memorable turn as guitarist Outspan Foster in Alan Parker'sThe Commitments, but Glen Hansard, lead singer of the Irish rock group, the Frames, plays the forlorn busker with a searching intensity befitting a man not only broken-hearted from a fading long-distance relationship but also worried he will end up repairing vacuum cleaners just like his stoic father. Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; has the quirky, endearing quality necessary to play the girl. But as musicians whose compositions supply the soundtrack, their acting is secondary to the music they play. Hansard's deeply felt music immediately brings to mind Damien Rice's and David Gray's melancholy folk-rock ballads, while Irglov&aacute; provides a nice complement with a voice similar to Bj&ouml;rk's plaintive style. I have to admit the low-budget production values (it was made for just $150K) does make itself clear with some shaky, hand-held shots and overly grainy film stock.

He was very passionate about playing his songs he wrote and wanted to make a CD of his music. He became very fond of her. It was because they were enjoying making this CD. They both had past loves andwrote songs of the relationships that seemed lost.

It turns out that even when it's designed to be benign or even therapeutic, being forced to listen to certain music truly is torture.  Also at Gitmo, if a `detainee' tries to end his suffering by means of starvation, the U.S. military will force feed him so as to prevent this.'Once' is a force-feeding of folk music.The musical performances are characterized by an affected earnestness and a self-styled soulfulness.  They are self-conscious without being self-aware: in other words, a pre-ironic mindset.  Watching them made me uncomfortable in the way that one is uncomfortable when a nave, sensitive, and bad poet insists upon reading you his work and asking for feedback.This film is photographed with a blurry, hand held camera, and to say that the script is minimalist is an understatement. It is possible to momentarily forget that this film is fiction, that someone scripted this.  In my opinion, this is a deliberate cheat, a gimmick to conceal the thinness, corniness, and improbability of the plot.This is `The Blair Witch Project,' but with music.There is a sense of arrested development with Glen Hansard's character, a self-pitying 36-year-old still living at his father's house.  It's creepy to know that when this movie was made, Marketa Irglova was just 18.  The pair are reported to `dating' nowadays, and it is reasonable to suspect that the relationship was probably not `platonic' when they were composing and performing together prior to filming.In short, this film feels like the fantasy of a college sophomore, neglecting his classes in hopes that music will be his ticket out.

1113028,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B000X1Z0BU,Eric J. Anderson,"[2, 2]","I did not have high hopes for this film. It is mercifully short (85 minutes), which almost merits a star by itself -- filmmakers today cannot just tell a story and be done with it. They think they must add layers and drag it on for over two hours.The movie opens on a street corner somewhere in Ireland. A guy with a guitar is playing his modern folk tunes (what we'd now call ""indie music"") with his guitar case open for tips and contributions. After an altercation with a druggie who tries to steal his guitar case, cut to the nighttime, when he is wailing out a very personal song of woe, strumming loudly and emphatically. A young woman walks up and throws ten pence in his case, asking him if he wrote the song. An acquaintance is struck -- she is a Czehk immigrant who sells flowers on the street and does domestic cleaning. He's a vacuum cleaner repair man by day, working in his Dad's shop. But they both love to sing/play music, and dabble in writing it. Over the course of a couple of weeks, they work together to flesh out some songs he's written and record them, as the guy starts moving seriously toward trying to make it in the music biz.This film is one of the most charming things I've seen in years. It is a small film, a simple story about simple people with dreams, struggling with heartache and poor circumstances, who create something together, and in the process learn a bit about themselves and find a sudden, new, and deep friendship and love. It is amazing how authentic and real it comes off, amazing because this was a tiny movie, probably shot on video instead of film, cheap to make, with unknown actors. Yet Hollywood cannot seem to make a film that takes the audience into a friendship with living, breathing, real characters that you can't help but have immense affection for by the time the final credits roll. I can't say it never happens, but usually I'm painfully aware of contrivances and manipulations, poorly disguised.The central theme of the movie, the core around which everything revolves, is The Guy's songwriting and The Girl's collaboration with him in creating and performing it to make a demo recording. It is not really my kind of music. It is the music of simple feelings, performed by people who do not have perfect, trained voices. Forgive my Irish, but I'd call it ""sad b*stard music,"" because it's about heartache and longing and misunderstanding and reaching out for connection and love. The melodies are sometimes pretty, but it's main virtue is that it is sincere, if not often very poetic (by my standards). The great thing about it is that you can believe that these characters could write these songs, because they aren't that sophisticated. (Unlike the recent August Rush, where a child who has never played an instrument suddenly becomes a performing and composing prodigy. Talk about a leap.)And that's what stands out about this movie. Sincerity. Hard to find in a modern motion picture. I may not watch this multiple times, but I found it very moving, in a positive way.There is some bad language, perhaps authentic, but totally unnecessary. This could easily be redubbed and turned into a PG or even a G film.",5,"Simple, heartfelt. I love these characters.

The leading characters are gentle people who happen to sing as well as act and the love story they create is a fragile little tale that remains in the air as a nice memory after the credits are past.A Dublin busker (Glen Hansard) is a songwriter and singer who plies his music on the streets when his is not helping his warmly generous father (Bill Hodnett) in his vacuum repair shop: his songs reflect a ruptured love affair and are sensitively poignant.  Along comes a Czech girl (Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;) who sells flowers on the streets but is impressed enough with the lad's music to stop, listen, and even put ten cents in his case.  The two strike up a friendship (the girl plays the piano in a music shop during lunch hour) and in time these two bruised people interact in the wavelength of their love of music.  The lad meets the girl's daughter and mother (Danuse Ktrestova) - the father of the child is still in the Czech Republic -,  they all become friends, and with the help of a few fellow musicians they cut a recording that hopefully will launch the lad's career in a trip to London.  The mood of the extemporaneous feeling piece is one of developing love that can only happen once, especially given the histories of each of the two musicians.Writer/director John Carney demonstrates how a simple story can be made into a touching film for under $150,000. and on a shooting schedule of 17 days.  The featurettes have just as much tenderness in outlining the production of the film as the film itself.  The only problem with the film for this viewer is the music, which seems redundant and repetitive: for those who favor this type of music this will not be a 'flaw'.  It is admirable that films like this are being made, restoring our faith in honest craftsmanship backed by warmth of intent.

1113040,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000X1Z0BU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","It's been a while now since I saw ONCE, but there's been no lessening of impact. I marvel at it still and love it still. I've done the MP3 thing with the songs and have pimped the movie to my friends. Looking at the glowing reviews here, I don't really have much (or, really, anything) to contribute, other than my unreserved support for this fantastic movie. My apologies then for whatever redundancy may follow. Probably you've heard most or all of it before. Still, I'll hang a SPOILERS flag here.Getting somewhat poetic now: Modest in ambition, woeful in budgeting, but lavish in the ways that count, in honesty and heart and sheer musicality, ONCE quite easily measures up to any glossy product put out by Hollywood. ONCE looks unglamorous and at times even amateurish, and seems more real becuase of it. Featuring the blue-collar city of Dublin as seen thru the eyes of its inhabitants, ONCE tells of a tiny increment of time spent together by an Irish busker who repairs vacuum cleaners as his grown-up job and an impoverished young Czech woman who can make a piano sing. Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; in these roles are so natural and pitch perfect that I was startled when I found out how little professional acting they've previously done. I wasn't startled at all, of course, to learn that these two are real life musicians, and very gifted.Some background stuff, garnered mostly from a Glen Hansard interview I read in the Montreal Gazette (published 4.14.07): Director John Carney used to be the bassist for Hansard's real life band The Frames, before Carney moved on to cinema and directing. Originally Carney had only wanted to consult Hansard over Hansard's busking experiences and also to use his songs for ONCE. Actor Cillian Murphy had already signed on to play the lead role, but then he balked at singing the difficult shifts in Hansard's songs and also with working with Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, who had never acted before. Murphy pulled out, and a gutted Carney was out one leading man. Days later, Hansard asked Carney to play bass at a gig he was performing with Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; (they'd just collaborated on an album), and it was during this time, when Carney was rocking out and seeing how well Glen and Mark&eacute;ta were getting on, that Carney hit on the idea of having Hansard play the lead. Hansard, initially very reluctant, was eventually talked into it. The rest, as they say...Just to underscore how shoestring ONCE's budget was, John Carney had to engage in guerilla filmmaking, declining to pay the permits for street filming. The opening scene was shot with hidden long lenses, so the people on the street had no clue that a film was being made. One fallout to this was that when the scene called for the guy to run off with Hansard's character's guitar case, one unwitting bystander, trying to help out, booted the ""thief"" in the nuggets. Heh. In a way, not having bigger budgeting helped to make this a better film. Much of the dialogue is improvised, and there's an intimacy and an organic feel to the story that probably would never have been tapped into if the film had been better financed or cast with a name actor.But amateur shamateur. Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; develop amazing chemistry onscreen. It helps that they know each other in real and that the characters they play harbor real-life connotations, musicians playing musicians. In the credits, these characters are known only as ""the guy"" and ""the girl,"" but Hansard and Irglov&aacute; breathe life into them and deftly convey the melancholy and the relentless tediousness of their lives. The film premise is this, simply: two sad people finding a connection, creating brilliant music and then parting ways. There's a romance, but it's unrequited and mostly unremarked upon. The girl is married, with a little girl. The guy, suffering from a broken heart, halfway hopes of someday doing big things with his music, but is stuck in a rut. The girl proves to be the motivating push. I think it would've played false if the ending had been different. As it is, what goes on between the two is understated and bittersweet and terribly romantic. There's something so wistful and sad about the girl's last lingering look out the window in that closing scene, as the camera then pans out to the street and the end credits roll.The musical performances are what elevate this film into something truly special. There are tiny, significant moments etched out in this slice of life story, little vignettes full of glancing looks and endearingly awkward conversation and a sense that honest to gosh lives are actually being lived here. But there are at least four absolutely showstopping moments in ONCE, and these happen when Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; play their instruments and lift their voices to sing. The guy's savage evening rendition of ""Say It To Me Now"" out in the street. The riveting duet of ""Falling Slowly"" (my favorite) in the music shop. The girl's late night excursion to the convenience store and her stroll back home as she sings the lyrics she'd just composed to the guy's music (""If You Want Me""). The guy's makeshift band recording ""When Your Mind's Made Up"" in the studio and the sound engineer getting schooled by the band's performance. All amazing, flawless stuff.DVD bonus features come in the way of what I think is a must-hear film commentary by Glen Hansard, Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; and Director John Carney; a separate commentary by the same three on six of the songs; ""making a modern day musical"" - the Making Of featurette (12.5 minutes long); ""more guy, more girl"" - a segment exploring the relationship between the two central characters (9.5 minutes long); a webisode ""broken hearted hoover fixer sucker guy"" (basically, this is just some rough sketches set to this song); and the option to download ""Falling Slowly"" from the motion picture soundtrack.The key, of course, is that we so personally identify with these working class characters, who everyday struggle and doubt like we do and whose personal triumphs, like ours, are more often than not measured in modest achievements. This movie reaffirms that in the routine and greyness of our days are sometimes concealed shades of color. And that, if nothing else, there is always music. I love this movie.But I wonder how ""the guy"" had got on in London?",5,a broken-hearted Hoover fixer sucker guy and a sad vacuum cleaner dragging girl: unrequited,1234828800,"02 17,

I listened to the melodies, the lyrics, and absolutely enjoyed it every time it was played. An easy five star rating for the music.  So, I then almost anxiously got a copy of the DVD and was ready to be carried away by a modern day ""musical"".As the movie unfolded ....it was obvious that the movie was a vehicle for the music and not the other way around.  Normally, this would be fine if a) the script was good, b) the acting was fair, or c) if the production was such that it created the charm of the music.  If you watch the Extra Features, the director proudly says that he started with a sixty page script and he didn't want to overcomplicate the project with the pressure of overinvestment.  I can certainly appreciate why someone might feel that way, but the overall story just missed.  First, the songs don't tell the story of the characters very well and in some cases they down right contradict what's presented in the movie.  This is what happens when a script is thrown together using some extremely talented musicians without any acting experience.  I certainly don't fault the main characters, but they simply didn't pull off their parts with many lines being choppy and unconvincing.  There was no real flow or continuity just pronouncements about what was coming next and the reaction of the actors to those pronouncements.  So, all in all, the soundtrack set a bar for the movie that was so high that it was not going to work unless they really attempted to mold the movie more closely to the lyrics of the songs.I can see why this won awards at Sundance ...if you never heard the music and just sat back and treated it like a very rough indy movie, you'd be carried away by the music missing that the acting was both forgivable and forgetable.  But unfortunately, the movie, the direction, the many occurences when a scene didn't work and when they should have reshot (assuming the director knew to reshoot ... maybe he didn't) just made the movie clumsy and awkward ... something like the main characters.  Perhaps there's some beauty in that, but it is clearly a case of lost potential with such a beautiful soundtrack primarily written by Glen Hansard.In case you're interested in the story ...it's a boy meets girl in Dublin, he plays music, she plays music, they play music together.  Reality and history ulitmately set in and the rest you can find out by watching the movie (or reading another review that has a spoiler in it).So I highly recommend ...buying the CD ... listening to it a million times ... borrow the video and watch it Once (no pun intended) ... and if you really think that it rivals Brief Encounters or has the charm of similar movies (non-musical) like Before Sunrise, maybe even purchase it.",3,"Five star soundtrack, One star script ....",1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,2944,"['nearly', '300', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'reviews', 'already', 'Amazon', 'normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'adding', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'case', 'am.I', 'received', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'played', 'over', 'again', 'listened', 'melodies', 'lyrics', 'absolutely', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'was', 'played', 'easy', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'music', 'So', 'then', 'almost', 'anxiously', 'got', 'copy', 'DVD', 'was', 'ready', 'be', 'carried', 'away', 'modern', 'day', 'musical', 'movie', 'unfolded', '.it', 'was', 'obvious', 'movie', 'was', 'vehicle', 'music', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'Normally', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'script', 'was', 'good', 'b', 'acting', 'was', 'fair', 'c', 'production', 'was', 'such', 'created', 'charm', 'music', 'watch', 'Extra', 'Features', 'director', 'proudly', 'started', 'sixty', 'page', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'overcomplicate', 'project', 'pressure', 'overinvestment', 'can', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'why', 'someone', 'might', 'feel', 'way', 'overall', 'story', 'just', 'missed', 'First', 'songs', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'story', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'cases', 'down', 'right', 'contradict', 'what', 'presented', 'movie', 'what', 'when', 'script', 'thrown', 'together', 'using', 'extremely', 'talented', 'musicians', 'acting', 'experience', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'main', 'characters', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'parts', 'many', 'lines', 'being', 'choppy', 'unconvincing', 'was', 'real', 'flow', 'continuity', 'just', 'pronouncements', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'next', 'reaction', 'actors', 'pronouncements', 'So', 'soundtrack', 'set', 'bar', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'high', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'work', 'really', 'attempted', 'mold', 'movie', 'more', 'closely', 'lyrics', 'songs.I', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'won', 'awards', 'Sundance', 'never', 'heard', 'music', 'just', 'sat', 'back', 'treated', 'very', 'rough', 'indy', 'movie', ""'d"", 'be', 'carried', 'away', 'music', 'missing', 'acting', 'was', 'forgivable', 'forgetable', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'direction', 'many', 'occurences', 'when', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'reshot', 'assuming', 'director', 'knew', 'reshoot', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'made', 'movie', 'clumsy', 'awkward', 'something', 'main', 'characters', 'Perhaps', 'beauty', 'clearly', 'case', 'lost', 'potential', 'beautiful', 'soundtrack', 'primarily', 'written', 'Glen', 'Hansard.In', 'case', ""'re"", 'interested', 'story', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'Dublin', 'music', 'music', 'play', 'music', 'together', 'Reality', 'history', 'ulitmately', 'set', 'rest', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'watching', 'movie', 'reading', 'review', 'spoiler', 'highly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'CD', 'listening', 'million', 'times', 'borrow', 'video', 'watch', 'Once', 'pun', 'intended', 'really', 'think', 'Brief', 'Encounters', 'charm', 'similar', 'movies', 'non-musical', 'Sunrise', 'maybe', 'even', 'purchase']",Once

He will learn later she is Czech, married, has a child and is living in Ireland with her mother and her child waiting for her husband to join them. In spite of that a collaboration becomes possible and a full CD is composed, rehearsed, recorded and burnt in time for him to go to London to work with some producers. He invites her on his last night in Ireland and she accepts but will not come and his only farewell will come from his father. On the following morning he goes away but stops in a music store and has a piano delivered to her. End of story: the piano is delivered and used with the finally arrived husband. Charming story in which artistic gifts and desires are not always expressed, do not always find their way to some audience, and may be completely wrecked by some horny or kinky illumination. But when art leads beyond this skin deep impulse there can be a way to some achievement. In many ways a good Irish hence catholic film in which Catholicism is some kind of morality that leads to a certain life style.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,"Green, Irish, charming and musical",1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,1576,"['funny', 'little', 'Irish', 'film', 'birth', 'delivery', 'music', 'group', 'album', 'result', 'chance', 'meeting', 'young', 'guitar', 'player', 'singing', 'street', 'young', 'pianist', 'slightly', 'composer', 'just', 'passing', 'listening', 'meeting', 'two', 'starting', 'bad', 'foot', 'ten', 'cents', 'street', 'one', 'full', 'song', 'later', 'more', 'lame', 'proposal', 'knew', 'nothing', 'will', 'learn', 'later', 'Czech', 'married', 'child', 'living', 'Ireland', 'mother', 'child', 'waiting', 'husband', 'join', 'spite', 'collaboration', 'possible', 'full', 'CD', 'composed', 'rehearsed', 'recorded', 'burnt', 'time', 'go', 'London', 'work', 'producers', 'last', 'night', 'Ireland', 'will', 'not', 'come', 'only', 'farewell', 'will', 'come', 'father', 'following', 'morning', 'away', 'music', 'store', 'piano', 'delivered', 'End', 'story', 'piano', 'delivered', 'used', 'finally', 'arrived', 'husband', 'Charming', 'story', 'artistic', 'gifts', 'desires', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'expressed', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'find', 'way', 'audience', 'may', 'be', 'completely', 'wrecked', 'horny', 'kinky', 'illumination', 'when', 'art', 'skin', 'deep', 'impulse', 'can', 'be', 'way', 'achievement', 'many', 'ways', 'good', 'Irish', 'hence', 'catholic', 'film', 'Catholicism', 'kind', 'morality', 'certain', 'life', 'style.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",Once

Even more than the romance, it is about Dublin, about carrying on in fragile circumstances, and about giving oneself and others a second chance.

Even in that anonymity, however, they are finely drawn and portrayed individuals.  Once is a movie to see more often than its title.

""The Guy"" is a ragged Irish street singer with a beat-up guitar who reserves his own most pained and poignant works for the evening, when no one listens anyway. We encounter ""The Girl,"" a Czech street peddler of magazines and flowers, who also has a talent for music and who is attracted by the depth of the Guy's music. Given less talented writers, ""Once"" could quickly have devolved into romantic nonsense. But both the Guy and the Girl have unresolved romantic commitments that prevent them from easily falling into a tryst. Watching them grapple with their love and appreciation for each other while honoring their previous attachments is one of the joys of this movie.""Once"" is basically a vehicle for publicizing the music of Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; -- the leads who actually wrote most of the music in the film. One suspects that the film is a lightly veiled version of their own stories. But, the locales and characters portrayed in the film are varied and interesting. From heroin addicts, to unemployed immigrants, to street musicians and poets singing for their dinner, the film is full of characters that are real and wonderful. The music is also quite charming -- especially if you are drawn to the kind of moody, introspective folk genre that is half crazed with regret, passion and mourning over lost relationships.""Once"" is a wonderful tale of two people from different backgrounds who come together, for a moment, over a love of music. It is about getting unstuck from self-imposed limits. It is about taking chances and risking failure. It is about finding lost love and starting again. It is about life itself.

1113055,A1493DD8LRGOKC,B000X1Z0BU,J. Kim,"[1, 1]","Once is the street magician of musicals; its natural efficiency makes Dreamgirls look like Sigfried & Roy--a sparkling make-under of its genre, and a lovely sigh of a film.I agree with the other reviewers that it resembles Before Sunrise in realistic style and pacing--except Once uses music in place of introspective conversation to achieve a sensory magic that only music can stimulate.  You don't even have to be a fan of this kind of music to experience the fullness of the story through it.Amazon's clip of the two leads (played by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglov&aacute;, neither of their characters is named) first harmonizing in the music shop is the perfect selection. It comes about 15 minutes in, and is where the film (by the director's own admission) really starts. It's a very tentative moment of connection through a song, itself of searching for connection, that evokes Trufaut's ""400 Blows"" in the way it brings the viewer into the equation. It's a brilliant sensory parallel: While listening to the music, experiencing each note and at the same time anticipating the next in the melody, the viewer also watches in wonderment and waiting, trying to understand what is going on between these two obscure people at that exact moment, and trying to detect what they will be in the moment after that.The actors are both untrained, but it's neither evident nor non-evident in their performances. Sorry, that was a terribly composed sentence--what I mean is, while their performances are subtle and richly felt, they aren't ""naturals"" at acting; they ARE, however, naturals in their particular roles in this particular film.  They just fit, and everything about it just feels right somehow.  So much so that I wasn't at all surprised to discover that the lead actors were friends who met 6-7 years before, and that they began to see each other in a romantic light during filming. Hansard, 37, demonstrates an affecting hesitation and tentativeness around Irglov&aacute;, who is 19, that is appropriate both for the plot, and the real-life fact that she is so young.In the excellent commentary with the actors and director, the director notes that the original script called for a kiss, and Hansard refused and wasn't comfortable with it.  The grey area of romantic appropriateness befits the plot (the title denotes man's hesitation to act, waiting for ""Once this-or-that happens""), and makes the characters' interactions more interesting, striking a perfect balance between discomfort and harmony.The fact that this was shot in 17 days for $175,000 is pretty amazing.  But, again, it seems to add to the film for the better, giving it an improvisational and true-to-life feeling.  The sets are real places in Dublin, adding to the sense that all this could've happened yesterday, and maybe it will happen tomorrow, you never know.This is just one of those rare, rare movies where all the behind-the-scenes events and interpersonal relationships are so oddly, perfectly manifest in the finished product.The DVD includes commentary by the actors and director on both the film and the songs.

Wait, the lead characters were never given a name?!Maybe I was a little slow the night I watched it, but it took a little thinking afterwards to completely understand the movie, or at least take it the way that I did.The story of Once can be summed up by saying that Guy meet Girl and they make music together. That's what it was the second after viewing, but an hour or so later, I realized that their love was shown. It was shown the only it could have been shown, and that was through the music they made together.After it clicked for me, I smiled. John Carney has written a sort of forbidden love story using music. The interactions given by our leads, Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, are near perfection.

1113065,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B000X1Z0BU,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[4, 5]","While this movie is often termed a musical, I think that is a misnomer. Yes, it is a film about two musicians, one male and the other female. Yes, music does play a prominent part in this film. Yes, there is one scene (on a bus as I recall) where the guy breaks into song when describing the love of his life to the girl beside him, someone relatively new in his life. Yes, there are lots of band rehearsals and all that.But this isn't Grease or Hairspray or Les Miserables or even Sweeney Todd. It isn't THAT kind of musical. So I think the word doesn't do justice to the film. It is very watchable even for those who tend to hate musicals.The plot, such as it is, focuses on a guy who is trying to figure out what to do with his life in the wake of a breakup. Along comes a rather chatty young woman who hangs out with him and the two hit it off. I don't want to mislead the potential viewer  so let me stress that ""hitting it off"" is not a way of saying there is high drama and passion.The delight of this film is that it is low-key, intentionally so (if you get the DVD be sure and watch what the director says about the film). It isn't meant to be a typical Hollywood blockbuster but more of a slice of life film.I loved it, absolutely,totally - as did my son. He liked the music a great deal, much of it vocal music. While I appreciated that, I also enjoyed the refreshing look at two people who were helping and supporting one another as they struggled to figure out how their lives had gotten off track - and where to go from there.I think that gives you enough of a basis to figure out if the film is worth viewing. I'd urge you to see it. If you want high drama or suspense or a mystery thriller then don't take a chance on it. If you are up for a good film, nicely done, about two people and the normal ups and downs of life (especially as musicians), you're likely to enjoy this.",5,"Don't be put off by the ""musical"" tag.

I just wish I could write songs like this guy and girl!  I checked out the credits because i didnt even know that the movie's stars are the actual songwriters and obviously performers.  I also noticed acting credits said ""the guy"" and ""the girl""- I didn't even realize that they had no names until the end credits.The existing reviews give good movie summaries, so i'll just point out a few of my favorite scenes.  Well, to start with I'm obsessive about watching the beginning of a movie- if I miss the beginning I don't want to see it.  Because the beginning is usually the best part- well I loved how art and commerce collide at the beginning when the street singer is robbed of his few dollars while he's singing, by another street person and then chases the robber through the streets- funny stuff.  Then I loved how after the ""girl and guy"" meet, she brings her vacuum cleaner so he can fix it and she rolls it down the street like she's was walking a dog!  Hilarious.  Then the couple visit a music store and she gets on the piano and he teaches her a new song of his and I was just overcome by this scene.  I think that girls cry when they're young and that guys start crying when they get older- because I just started tearing up!  I don't even know these people but I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the music.  I thought at that moment-- that is what music is- its love, its sex, its beautiful.  Music is magic and this scene was magic.I also liked how she lived with her mother and they didn't have a phone and their neighbors came by to watch tv because they were the only tenants in the building with a television.  Well i tell you, there isn't one phony moment in this whole film.  And you keep waiting for the big kiss or the sex scene like most Hollywood movies, but it never happens.  The girl and guy share a love or friendship through music that didn't need to consummate into romance.  Although you keep hoping it does!

Finally I rented it.Once is not a film for mere observers looking for light-hearted entertainment. Instead it's one of those movies that requires an emotional connection. Unless you regularly watch foreign films, you might want to tread carefully because this film is very typical of the slower story telling pace. If you are looking for a love story and a date movie, you are likely to be disappointed. But if you love fragments of reality in literature, art and song, you may find Once very fulfilling.Once is a character study of two lonely people, both heart-broken in love, and by life. It's almost as if the camera follows them documentary-style through the humdrumness of their lives. But they spark as they connect over shared dreams -- music.There is a poignant heaviness that colors the film a little drab. The song lyrics weave brokeness through simple folksy flavored acoustic melodies.If you aren't certain, rent it before buying. Read all the reviews.

He wants to be a full time musician and in his spare time he plays in the downtown area on the streets of Dublin. Marketa and her infant daughter live with her widowed mother in a small apartment. We learn she is estranged from her husband (still living in the Czech Republic) and it just wasn't working out. She sells flowers and other small items on the streets to support her small family. They meet on the street when she listens to one of his songs and strikes up a conversation. She, too, loves music and 'borrows' a piano at the local music store during lunch because she can't afford a piano of her own. They find they have a shared passion for writing and creating music.

Unlike some of the other reviewers I liked the fact that they relationship between the Guy and the Girl did not follow the typical Hollywood arc. Another refreshing departure from the standard movie musical was the relationship between the Guy and his father. The music is a matter of taste. I happened to like it and understand that street musicians cannot deal in subtleties; they have to grab the audience by the throat. This movie's other achievement it to reimagining the musical in a more realistic way, and on that level it is a triumph. The music is more organic and not artificially injected into the story.

Guy (Glen Hansard) and Girl (Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;) meet when Girl stops to listen to Guy playing songs on his guitar for money on the street. Guy and Girl form a singularly beautiful relationship and the plot moves along very nicely.Guy and Girl come to know each other very well in a very short span of time--barely more than a week. Girl wants Guy to pick himself up and realize his dreams. She encourages Guy to make recordings of his songs with a band for a commercial CD so Guy can have fame as a musician. Guy seems confused as to whether or not Girl loves him; and there's a very well done scene in which Guy asks Girl to spend the night with him but she leaves.Girl, of course, has her own issues. Girl, her mother and daughter are in Ireland because Girl's relationship with her husband didn't work out. Girl likes spending time with Guy; she likes getting attention from a nice man and she eventually helps him in his recording sessions.Of course, from here the plot can go just about anywhere. Will Guy and Girl consummate their relationship? Will Guy go back to his former girlfriend in London? What will Girl do to support her child and mother in Ireland? Is there any hope for Guy to make his CD a success? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!The cinematography works so well partially because the hand held camera helps to set the thoughtful mood for this movie. The choreography works wonders in the opening theft scene and other scenes as well.The DVD comes with commentaries and a couple of interesting extras about how they made the film. Great!Overall, Once is a fine movie that people will enjoy if they like thoughtful movies about people and relationships in real life.

Chalk full of emotion, the lyrics and both the male and female voices have a transcending quality that stops you in your tracks and insists you listen.The characters (guy and girl) are understated, modest, and very real. There doesn't seem to be any acting going on, but it's a little like a documentary. He, the guy, is a guitarist, a singer-songwriter, singing for his supper in the off-hours of his job as a vacuum cleaner repairman. She, the girl, is Czech, a pianist, likes his music and happens to have a ""Hoover"" in need of repair. He sings on the streets, she sells flowers on the streets. Their ultimate meeting is not remarkable, but their unlikely coupling as a musical duo is. When they first sing together, there's immediate harmony. With the girl as muse, they find their way down a musical path and as I watched, I felt that no matter what was going to happen, everything about the film felt successful. It had a hand-made quality to it that felt believable.Shot mainly on the recognizable streets of Dublin, it's all very Irish and utterly charming.

Moore,"[8, 8]","I haven't seen ""Music & Lyrics,"" the movie in which Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore play a songwriting-romantic pair, but John Carney's ""Once"" probably can be described as a cross between ""Music & Lyrics"" and ""Brief Encounter."" This delicate little tale of the musical collaboration and almost-romance between a thirtysomething Dublin street busker (Glen Hansard) and a young Czech immigrant to Ireland (Marketa Irglova) leaves us breathless with its simplicity and beauty. There's a certain amount of stylization--this is the movies, after all--but not the kind we're used to from movie musicals. The beautiful, melancholy songs--nearly all of them by Hansard and/or Irglova--arise organically from the characters, because they are musicians, and the songs they write are how they express themselves. Hansard and Irglova both have lovely, impassioned singing voices, and as actors they have a natural, unforced charisma. (Irglova is a first-time actress, but viewers may remember Hansard as Outspan, guitarist for ""The Commitments."") Carney's hand-held cameras give the film a near-documentary feel that nevertheless doesn't skimp on either sentiment or humor. The film's very first scene, depicting Hansard's attempts while busking to keep an obnoxious drunk from stealing his tips, is laugh-out-loud funny while demonstrating the precariousness of Hansard's existence.

1113087,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000X1Z0BU,mirasreviews,"[15, 16]","""Once"" is an attempt at a musical for modern audiences, in which the characters express themselves through music but don't burst into song in places where it seems inappropriate. The two main characters are musicians, so it's natural for their feelings to be reflected in the songs they write. A street musician (Glen Hansard) in Dublin, Ireland sings popular covers by day and is trying out his own music on passersby at night when a friendly and somewhat impertinent street vendor (Marketa Irglova) stops to talk. It turns out that she is a classically trained pianist from the Czech Republic. The busker never had much ambition, but he is inspired by a fruitful collaboration with his new friend and finally motivated to record his music.You may recognize Glen Hansard as the frontman for the Irish band The Frames. John Carney, who wrote and directed the film, was formerly a band member. His philosophy in casting was to get ""really good singers who can half-act"" instead of settling for actors with mediocre musical talents. Hansard and Irglova are not professional actors, so ""Once"" uses a lot of long lenses by necessity. It's shot documentary style with some handheld work, but only occasionally shaky. The awkwardness of the characters' relationship and the man's palpable frustration create a strong sense of realism. Ironically, the only thing that feels self-conscious and inauthentic is that we so rarely hear the characters names spoken. Several of the songs are quite good, and they do, indeed, seem natural in their context.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): There are 4 featurettes and an audio commentary. ""Making a Modern Day Musical"" (12 min) interviews John Carney about his inspiration and approach, working on a micro budget, non-actors, and Glen Hansard about writing the songs. ""More Guy, More Girl"" (9 min) talks to the director and actors about the characters' relationship and audience reaction. ""Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Guy"" (1 min) is a webisode animated with stick figures. ""Musical Commentary with writer-director John Carney and actor/musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova"" takes us through the13 songs and fragments with commentary on filming and performing them. The audio commentary with John Carney, Glen Hansard, and Marketa Irglova comments scene-by-scene on characters, filming, the role of music, genesis of the project, locations, the director's intentions.

While ""Once"" is not a traditional musical, about 60% of the film is made up of music.  What makes this movie so special is the way the music is developed.  The Guy and the Girl (that's how the characters are identified) meet in Dublin, Ireland.  The Guy is a native and the Girl is from the Czech Republic.  They are both struggling musicians and begin a friendship that produces some of the best original music from a movie in years (won an Oscar for best song).Naturally they are attracted to each other but both carry relationship baggage of the recent past.  Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are rookie actors in the lead roles but are real musicians that became real lovers off-screen.  The Guy and the Girl are obviously meant for each other yet remain committed to others so their relationship doesn't go much beyond great friendship.  But the final scene where the Girl is looking forlornly out her window lets you know she may have just lost more than a musical partner.When I first saw this film, I was mesmerized by the development of the music.  It was so real it felt almost like a documentary.  Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are perfect in their roles and show a different side of acting.  Both are terrific musicians and the music is some of the best I've heard in a film.  The songs are poignant and just gorgeous.  Three great scenes to watch for:  1. When the Guy and the Girl finish the standout ""Falling Slowly"" that the Guy had begun to write.  This is done in a music store.  2.  When the Girl, listening on headphones, sings the words she had written to the Guy's song while walking home from the store where she had purchased batteries for the CD player.  Done in one take!  3.  When the Girl struggles through a very sad song she had written and finally breaks down before she can finish.  Just great direction and great emotion from the actors.  There are many other great scenes in this simple but effective and heartbreakingly beautiful story completed on a miniscule budget.I had purchased this upgrade to a DVD I owned based on improved video quality as well as an uncompressed audio track.  The Blu ray video is excellent and is definitely better than the original DVD.  The audio is not what was advertised by the seller's (not Amazon) website or even on the Blu ray jacket.  Here is the wording on the jacket label: ""Feature audio:  Dolby Digital 5.1/DTS Surround DTS-HD Master Audio.""  Here's what you get:  DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  There are 2 additional commentary channels both in DTS-HD MA 2.0.  While I admit I was disappointed and clearly this is a labeling error, I have to assume the filmmakers wanted it this way.  The sound is clear and strong, but is not the surround generally expected.  I suspect the idea was to keep the sound in its basic format as it was made at the time.",5,"If you can't get to Broadway for the live show, check out this imported Blu ray",1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,2971,"['was', 'favorite', 'film', '2007', 'just', 'purchased', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', 'European', 'product', 'will', 'discuss', 'later', 'review', 'Once', 'not', 'traditional', 'musical', 'about', '60', '%', 'film', 'made', 'music', 'What', 'movie', 'so', 'special', 'way', 'music', 'developed', 'Guy', 'Girl', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'identified', 'meet', 'Dublin', 'Ireland', 'Guy', 'native', 'Girl', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'are', 'struggling', 'musicians', 'begin', 'friendship', 'best', 'original', 'music', 'movie', 'years', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'song', '.Naturally', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'carry', 'relationship', 'baggage', 'recent', 'past', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'are', 'rookie', 'actors', 'lead', 'roles', 'are', 'real', 'musicians', 'became', 'real', 'lovers', 'off-screen', 'Guy', 'Girl', 'are', 'obviously', 'meant', 'other', 'yet', 'remain', 'committed', 'others', 'so', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'great', 'friendship', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'Girl', 'looking', 'forlornly', 'window', 'lets', 'know', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'lost', 'more', 'musical', 'partner.When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'development', 'music', 'was', 'so', 'real', 'felt', 'almost', 'documentary', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'show', 'different', 'side', 'acting', 'are', 'terrific', 'musicians', 'music', 'best', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'film', 'songs', 'are', 'poignant', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'Three', 'great', 'scenes', 'watch', '1', 'When', 'Guy', 'Girl', 'finish', 'standout', 'Falling', 'Slowly', 'Guy', 'had', 'begun', 'write', 'done', 'music', 'store', '2', 'When', 'Girl', 'listening', 'headphones', 'words', 'had', 'written', 'Guy', 'song', 'walking', 'home', 'store', 'where', 'had', 'purchased', 'batteries', 'CD', 'player', 'Done', 'one', 'take', '3', 'When', 'Girl', 'very', 'sad', 'song', 'had', 'written', 'finally', 'breaks', 'down', 'can', 'finish', 'Just', 'great', 'direction', 'great', 'emotion', 'actors', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'scenes', 'simple', 'effective', 'heartbreakingly', 'beautiful', 'story', 'completed', 'miniscule', 'budget.I', 'had', 'purchased', 'upgrade', 'DVD', 'owned', 'based', 'improved', 'video', 'quality', 'as', 'well', 'uncompressed', 'audio', 'track', 'Blu', 'ray', 'video', 'excellent', 'definitely', 'better', 'original', 'DVD', 'audio', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'advertised', 'seller', 'not', 'Amazon', 'website', 'even', 'Blu', 'ray', 'jacket', 'Here', 'wording', 'jacket', 'label', 'Feature', 'audio', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1/DTS', 'Surround', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'Here', 'what', 'get', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '2.0', 'are', '2', 'additional', 'commentary', 'channels', 'DTS-HD', 'MA', '2.0', 'admit', 'was', 'disappointed', 'clearly', 'labeling', 'error', 'have', 'assume', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'way', 'sound', 'clear', 'strong', 'not', 'surround', 'generally', 'expected', 'suspect', 'idea', 'was', 'keep', 'sound', 'basic', 'format', 'was', 'made', 'time']",Once

He's a musician, and all his songs seem to be about a particular ex-girlfriend. He plays his guitar and sings in the street for change, also working in his father's vacuum cleaner repair shop to make money.One day, our guy meets a girl (played by Marketa Irglova). The girl, a Czech immigrant, has a young daughter, and she works like crazy (flower seller, paper seller, etc.) to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. Turns out, she's also a musician. She plays the piano and writes songs.The two feel an immediate affinity for one another, and pretty soon, they are playing songs together. The girl has immense confidence in our guy, and she helps him get a small business loan so that he can record a professional demo in a Dublin studio. They get a small band together, haggle with a sound guy over studio space, and spend a wonderful weekend cutting the demo, which everyone pretty much agrees is brilliant.Over the course of the film, we realize that the two are falling for each other, but the ending is not trite and syrupy.

These are two souls who are joined by the passion of the music they create, and another of the perfect tones of the film is just how tellingly the story captures the songwriting and recording process. Having completed a couple of discs, I can tell you that they got it right, to the very last detail.The tunes fit the story and while they may not be the greatest songs ever written, they have an emotional honesty that will remind you of Christy Moore or MIke Scott, and in that regard they are brilliant. In the end, the love goes unconsummated but not unrequited, and you'll just have to go see the film. I'll certainly pick it up on DVD as it reminds me of someone from a long time ago, and as I left the theatre, I could tell there were hosts of others with similar thoughts.

1113095,A3KR9Q99D1EGEB,B000X1Z0BU,"Odysseus ""A Traveller""","[2, 2]","In our cynical age, it somehow seems especially creative, even courageous, to make a film that is not about corruption, ennui, ulterior motives, dysfunctional social structures, or tragic flaws.  Once is a film that is refreshing in its earnestness and in its respect for the things that add meaning and beauty to our lives.I'm not a musician, but I once aspired to be one.  And if I have one pet peeve about film generally, it's how film often disrespects music.  It's often treated as a subordinate art, mixed in to add a little punch to the main event, the dramatic narrative.  So many films use music carelessly.Not this film.  This is a film whose central focus is the way that music forges bonds between people; how music enables us to express our feelings, and not only to better understand but to care about others; and how music is sometimes the most beautiful thing available to grab hold of.This film reminded me of a conversation I once had with a friend, in which we concluded that for almost every person's romantic moments, music is somehow involved. Maybe it's a song you've danced to together, or heard together during a special sharing moment.  Maybe it's simply music that you listened to privately to work through intense feelings.  All in all, I'd wager that few of us have ever fallen in love without music being a big part of the picture.This film is essentially a musical - but it's not like any other musical I've seen.  It's not a film that asks you to shift back and forth between plausible dramatic action and wholly implausible musical production numbers.  Instead, in this film, the music is central to the action; the characters are making music together, and every piece of music performed in the film is in a context where you fully believe those characters might make music together in that way.  I can't think of another film where the music seemed to matter so much to the characters.We are so conditioned in our culture to indulge our societal ADD at the expense of respecting music and its uplifting power.  Thus, when I first watched this film, I was initially feeling like, ""OK, enough of this song, time to cut to something else,"" - as if sitting through an entire piece of music was more than a film could ask of me.  But unless a film does this, it can never fully convey the sense of the joy of making music, and how it brings you closer to other people.  The film shows people experiencing this in all its fullness, a special, deeply human experience worth celebrating.In a lesser film, the film's studio scene would involve some kind of subplot during the performance - furtive glances, repressed conflicts, other dramatic elements - it's all too easy to imagine.  Here the only focus of the scene is the shared satisfaction of making the music itself.  Similarly, a dinner party depicted in the film is significant chiefly for the music that people share during it.The film is shot in a very natural, unobtrusive style; you often feel as though you are just a fly on the wall, whether it's in a repair shop or an apartment.OK, a small confession: the music in this film isn't really my cup of tea.  It's more repetitive than I would like, especially so in the lyrics.  And I have an issue with music that is too persistently emotive.  I can deal with a song building to a pitch of emotionalism, but the songs in this film tried to sustain that high pitch more than is my personal taste.  But I say this not to criticize the film; it's simply to say that you can enjoy and respect this film even if this isn't your favorite musical genre. And, I must say, there is no denying that the protagonists do produce some harmonies that are genuinely, hauntingly lovely.  Favorite genre or no, there is some truly beautiful music here.Another thing I appreciated about this film is that it felt no need to create contrived situations, black hats, or exaggerated conflicts.  The characters are real people, dealing with plausible issues - heartbreak, loneliness, parental responsibility, regret, money problems, frustrated hopes - which the film doesn't overplay.  It just shows men and women using music to work out the feelings that arise in their lives.  And, it should be said, the music enables the viewer to feel some of the emotion, too.  I saw some moist eyes at film's end.I'm uncertain how much to recommend this film to my friends; it's certainly not Citizen Kane.  I am afraid that one of them would put it in the DVD player, decide the music was too plaintive, and start rolling their eyes.  For me, though, it all pulsed with sincerity, and I appreciated that feeling.Music is one of the most precious enrichments of the human experience. This film respects that, and honors it.",4,A humble tribute to the bonds forged through music,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,4729,"['cynical', 'age', 'somehow', 'especially', 'creative', 'even', 'courageous', 'make', 'film', 'not', 'corruption', 'ennui', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'dysfunctional', 'social', 'structures', 'tragic', 'flaws', 'Once', 'film', 'refreshing', 'earnestness', 'respect', 'things', 'add', 'meaning', 'beauty', 'lives.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'musician', 'once', 'aspired', 'be', 'one', 'have', 'one', 'pet', 'peeve', 'film', 'generally', 'how', 'film', 'often', 'music', 'often', 'treated', 'subordinate', 'art', 'mixed', 'add', 'little', 'punch', 'main', 'event', 'dramatic', 'narrative', 'So', 'many', 'films', 'use', 'music', 'carelessly.Not', 'film', 'film', 'central', 'focus', 'way', 'music', 'bonds', 'people', 'how', 'music', 'express', 'feelings', 'not', 'only', 'better', 'understand', 'care', 'others', 'how', 'music', 'sometimes', 'most', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'available', 'grab', 'hold', 'of.This', 'film', 'reminded', 'conversation', 'once', 'had', 'friend', 'concluded', 'almost', 'person', 'romantic', 'moments', 'music', 'somehow', 'involved', 'Maybe', 'song', ""'ve"", 'danced', 'together', 'heard', 'together', 'special', 'sharing', 'moment', 'simply', 'music', 'listened', 'privately', 'work', 'intense', 'feelings', ""'d"", 'wager', 'few', 'have', 'ever', 'fallen', 'love', 'music', 'being', 'big', 'part', 'picture.This', 'film', 'essentially', 'musical', 'not', 'other', 'musical', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'film', 'shift', 'back', 'forth', 'plausible', 'dramatic', 'action', 'wholly', 'implausible', 'musical', 'production', 'numbers', 'Instead', 'film', 'music', 'central', 'action', 'characters', 'are', 'making', 'music', 'together', 'piece', 'music', 'performed', 'film', 'context', 'where', 'fully', 'believe', 'characters', 'might', 'make', 'music', 'together', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'where', 'music', 'seemed', 'matter', 'so', 'much', 'characters.We', 'are', 'so', 'conditioned', 'culture', 'indulge', 'societal', 'ADD', 'expense', 'respecting', 'music', 'uplifting', 'power', 'Thus', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'film', 'was', 'initially', 'feeling', 'OK', 'enough', 'song', 'time', 'cut', 'something', 'else', 'sitting', 'entire', 'piece', 'music', 'was', 'more', 'film', 'could', 'ask', 'film', 'can', 'never', 'fully', 'convey', 'sense', 'joy', 'making', 'music', 'how', 'closer', 'other', 'people', 'film', 'people', 'experiencing', 'fullness', 'special', 'deeply', 'human', 'experience', 'worth', 'lesser', 'film', 'film', 'studio', 'scene', 'would', 'involve', 'kind', 'subplot', 'performance', 'furtive', 'glances', 'repressed', 'conflicts', 'other', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'too', 'easy', 'imagine', 'Here', 'only', 'focus', 'scene', 'shared', 'satisfaction', 'making', 'music', 'Similarly', 'dinner', 'party', 'depicted', 'film', 'significant', 'chiefly', 'music', 'people', 'share', 'it.The', 'film', 'shot', 'very', 'natural', 'unobtrusive', 'style', 'often', 'feel', 'are', 'just', 'fly', 'wall', 'repair', 'shop', 'apartment.OK', 'small', 'confession', 'music', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'cup', 'tea', 'more', 'repetitive', 'would', 'like', 'especially', 'so', 'lyrics', 'have', 'issue', 'music', 'too', 'persistently', 'emotive', 'can', 'deal', 'song', 'building', 'pitch', 'emotionalism', 'songs', 'film', 'tried', 'sustain', 'high', 'pitch', 'more', 'personal', 'taste', 'say', 'not', 'criticize', 'film', 'simply', 'say', 'can', 'enjoy', 'respect', 'film', 'even', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'musical', 'genre', 'must', 'say', 'denying', 'protagonists', 'do', 'produce', 'harmonies', 'are', 'genuinely', 'hauntingly', 'lovely', 'Favorite', 'genre', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'music', 'thing', 'appreciated', 'film', 'felt', 'need', 'create', 'contrived', 'situations', 'black', 'hats', 'exaggerated', 'conflicts', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'dealing', 'plausible', 'issues', 'heartbreak', 'loneliness', 'parental', 'responsibility', 'regret', 'money', 'problems', 'frustrated', 'hopes', 'film', ""n't"", 'overplay', 'just', 'men', 'women', 'using', 'music', 'work', 'out', 'feelings', 'arise', 'lives', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'music', 'viewer', 'feel', 'emotion', 'too', 'saw', 'moist', 'eyes', 'film', 'end.I', ""'m"", 'uncertain', 'how', 'much', 'recommend', 'film', 'friends', 'certainly', 'not', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'am', 'afraid', 'one', 'would', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'decide', 'music', 'was', 'too', 'plaintive', 'start', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'though', 'pulsed', 'sincerity', 'appreciated', 'feeling.Music', 'one', 'most', 'precious', 'enrichments', 'human', 'experience', 'film', 'honors']",Once

Once looks like minimalist art cinema at first glance - hand held shots, documentary style film making.  No elaborate stages, special effects or gorgeous technicolor that encompasses the modern musical.Rather, the film simply tells the story of a chance meeting between an unnamed man and unnamed woman who seem to share only a love for music and a lack of monetary affluence.  Yet thrugh music, their aspirations seem to grow, as does their relationship.  Despite the lack of grandiose compositions in the broadway fashion, the songs direct the course of the characters and are the cornerstone of the film, as it has little dialogue.Glen Hansard has been making music for years and has been featured on film in the past in the Committments, yet doesn't strike you as an actor.  But it's the naturalistic approach of his and Marketa Irglova's performance that makes the film so great.  It feels like we're feeling and following the passion of these two characters.

1113107,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000X1Z0BU,Robert Moore,"[5, 5]","This is one of those rare movies that defies any neat classification. It isn't a traditional love story by any stretch. Though it is filled with music from beginning to end it isn't really a musical. In the traditional musical characters will suddenly burst into song but it represented an interruption in the otherwise semi-realistic tone of the movie--think of Gene Kelly in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. But all the songs in this film are in line with the overall realism of the film, they are all songs that occur in normal life.I don't want to reveal much in the way of details about the movie since much of the joy of the film is discovering the ways it defies expectations. In broad outline it is about a street singer who has put his emotional life on cold storage because of a broken heart and the woman he meets who helps him open himself back up to life. During the day in Dublin he sings familiar standards for tips but at night, when the crowds thin out, he sings his own original material. We see him this way for the first time through the eyes of the Girl as she first meets him (in the credits the two lead characters, never addressed by name, are listed as Guy and Girl). He, played by Frames' frontman Glen Hansard, is singing an absolutely stunning song with intense passion. As he finishes, the camera pulls back to reveal her standing there. From thenceforward we see the two of them get to know each other as they perform a string of amazing songs together.Neither Glen Hansard nor Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; is a professional actor. Hansard did have a prominent role in another great Dublin film about music, THE COMMITMENTS. In that one Hansard played the band's guitarist Outspan Foster, one of the two original members of the band (he is the one who resists the suggestion of the other original member to call their band A Flock of Budgies). In real life, of course, Hansard has long been the resident genius of the great Irish rock band The Frames and both one of the great singers in rock as well as an absolutely brilliant songwriter (neither of which anyone who sees this movie will be inclined to doubt). While visiting Prague a couple of years back he met a precocious teenager who was none other than Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;. One thing led to another and within a year of their meeting they recorded and album together entitled THE SWELL SEASON. Next they appeared in this film by John Carney, himself a former member of The Frames. So their time together has been amazingly productive (she also appeared on the critically acclaimed new album by the Frames, THE COST).The film is filled with wonderful little moments, like the first meeting (driven by Hansard's magnificent performance of ""Say It To Me Now""). Or the way the sound engineer recording the Guy's song goes from disinterest to interest as he realizes just how good he is. Or the marvelous extended shot that follows the Girl from a convenience store where she has bought batteries for a CD player down the street for a few blocks as she sings the lyrics she has written for a song the Guy has written the music for.This truly is a very special film. It does not have the greatest production values; indeed, it feels like the low budget that it is. It works because the two leads, while not professional actors, have a wonderful chemistry both romantically and musically and because Glen Hansard is one of the finest songwriters around. In fact, the soundtrack for the film has to go down as one of the greatest soundtracks ever released. I would urge anyone who loves the music in this film to investigate not merely the soundtrack for the film, but both THE SWELL SEASON, the album by Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, and two albums by the Frames, FITZCARRALDO and THE COST.",5,Guy meets Girl and they literally make beautiful music together,1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,3787,"['one', 'rare', 'movies', 'neat', 'classification', ""n't"", 'traditional', 'love', 'story', 'stretch', 'filled', 'music', 'beginning', 'end', ""n't"", 'really', 'musical', 'traditional', 'musical', 'characters', 'will', 'suddenly', 'burst', 'song', 'represented', 'interruption', 'otherwise', 'semi-realistic', 'tone', 'movie', 'think', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'SINGIN', 'IN', 'THE', 'RAIN', 'songs', 'film', 'are', 'line', 'overall', 'realism', 'film', 'are', 'songs', 'occur', 'normal', 'life.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'much', 'way', 'details', 'movie', 'much', 'joy', 'film', 'discovering', 'ways', 'expectations', 'broad', 'outline', 'street', 'singer', 'who', 'put', 'emotional', 'life', 'cold', 'storage', 'broken', 'heart', 'woman', 'who', 'open', 'back', 'life', 'day', 'Dublin', 'familiar', 'standards', 'tips', 'night', 'when', 'crowds', 'out', 'own', 'original', 'material', 'see', 'way', 'first', 'time', 'eyes', 'Girl', 'first', 'credits', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'never', 'addressed', 'name', 'are', 'listed', 'Guy', 'Girl', 'played', 'Frames', 'frontman', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'singing', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'song', 'intense', 'passion', 'camera', 'back', 'reveal', 'standing', 'there', 'thenceforward', 'see', 'two', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'perform', 'string', 'amazing', 'songs', 'together.Neither', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'Mark', 'eacute', 'Irglov', 'aacute', 'professional', 'actor', 'Hansard', 'did', 'have', 'prominent', 'role', 'great', 'Dublin', 'film', 'music', 'COMMITMENTS', 'one', 'Hansard', 'played', 'band', 'guitarist', 'Outspan', 'Foster', 'one', 'two', 'original', 'members', 'band', 'one', 'who', 'suggestion', 'other', 'original', 'member', 'call', 'band', 'Flock', 'Budgies', 'real', 'life', 'course', 'Hansard', 'long', 'been', 'resident', 'genius', 'great', 'Irish', 'rock', 'band', 'Frames', 'one', 'great', 'singers', 'rock', 'as', 'well', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'songwriter', 'anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'inclined', 'doubt', 'visiting', 'Prague', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'met', 'precocious', 'teenager', 'who', 'was', 'none', 'other', 'Mark', 'eacute', 'Irglov', 'aacute', 'One', 'thing', 'led', 'year', 'meeting', 'recorded', 'album', 'together', 'entitled', 'THE', 'SWELL', 'SEASON', 'Next', 'appeared', 'film', 'John', 'Carney', 'former', 'member', 'Frames', 'time', 'together', 'been', 'amazingly', 'productive', 'also', 'appeared', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'new', 'album', 'Frames', 'THE', 'COST', '.The', 'film', 'filled', 'wonderful', 'little', 'moments', 'first', 'meeting', 'driven', 'Hansard', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'Say', 'Me', 'Now', 'way', 'sound', 'engineer', 'recording', 'Guy', 'song', 'disinterest', 'interest', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'marvelous', 'extended', 'shot', 'Girl', 'convenience', 'store', 'where', 'bought', 'batteries', 'CD', 'player', 'street', 'few', 'blocks', 'lyrics', 'written', 'song', 'Guy', 'written', 'music', 'for.This', 'truly', 'very', 'special', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'greatest', 'production', 'values', 'indeed', 'low', 'budget', 'two', 'leads', 'not', 'professional', 'actors', 'have', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'romantically', 'musically', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'one', 'finest', 'songwriters', 'around', 'fact', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'greatest', 'soundtracks', 'ever', 'released', 'would', 'urge', 'anyone', 'who', 'music', 'film', 'investigate', 'not', 'merely', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'THE', 'SWELL', 'SEASON', 'album', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'Mark', 'eacute', 'Irglov', 'aacute', 'two', 'albums', 'Frames', 'FITZCARRALDO', 'THE', 'COST']",Once
1113108,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B000X1Z0BU,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[1, 1]","I have to say, before I begin, that a great resonance of this film for me was the fact that it evoked my own musical past.  A Boston-based musician ""back in the day"" (WAY back!) I lived many of the same moments as ""He"" does in the film.That said, this is essentially a boy-meets-girls story, the twist being that He and She are both musicians.  But unlike most Hollywood-driven stories of this genre, the relationship is only a secondary focus.  Rather, it is the music that is at center stage...and what music it is.  Simple, real, and from the heart, it is the music and its development that carries the story forward.The two leads, He and She (for neither we nor they actually ever learn the characters' names) are played superbly by Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, non-actors, but also real life friends and musical collaborators.  He is played with earnest honesty (Hansard is essentially playing himself), and She is portrayed as whimsical, slightly ethereal, and strong-yet vulnerable.  Yet the lack of a Hollywood ham-fisted touch is clearly evident not only in the low budget, almost documentary style of John Carney's spot-on direction, but also in the evolution of the characters' story.  For while this is clearly a love story, it does not follow standard Hollywood protocol.  Indeed, there is no seal-the-deal first kiss, no sex, and the two characters do not set off into the sunset together.  Instead, they come together, enrich one another's lives, and then follow their individual paths...wherever those may lead.But this is not to say that the story or the film is lacking, for in place of the usual detailed unfolding of an intimate relationship to rivet the audience's attentions and emotions, here we get to witness the unfolding of the music, as ""His"" songs are slowly transformed from solo street ballads into remarkably listenable arrangements by a pick-up band of nameless street musicians...and recorded ""simply because.""It was in watching this unfolding that I was personally the most captured, because I have known the wonder Hansard perfectly captures and portrays as he first hears Irglov&aacute; accompany him on one of his songs.  I have lived the rush he experiences when his little accidental band suddenly transforms his solo efforts into something that somehow magically exceeds the limits of its own creation.  And I also lived through looking in the mirror, as He does, and realizing that all of his musical efforts ultimately spring from a crushed spirit.  While it is never explicitly touched upon in the movie, I wondered, as He goes off to apparently reclaim the track his life SHOULD have taken, whether he was wondering, as I did, whether his muse would leave once the hole in his spirit was healed and his heart was restored.But perhaps I am projecting too much of my own story on this wonderful film, a movie that people may read into, but which certainly needs no help in touching the heart, the emotions, and the soul.

Music being the primary medium in which these two individuals move through life, it is only appropriate that they should express their love for one another through music as well.Glen Hansard plays a struggling songwriter/musician whose recent, emotionally devastating breakup with the girl of his dreams now serves as the inspiration for most of his lyrics.  Marketa Irglova is a young woman who recently emigrated from the Czech Republic with her mother and daughter to begin a new life in Ireland.  She, too, is a composer of music, though she is less assertive and confident about exposing it to others than he is.  The two meet on the street one night while he is performing one of his original compositions and they begin a slow, tentative relationship based largely on their mutual love of music.""Once"" is a beautiful, lyrical and heartbreaking film that has understandably garnered a passionate cult following since its release in early 2007.  It is an utterly unique and spellbinding work in which the music is every bit as important as the dialogue.  The plot, though basic and uncluttered, still manages to throw a few curveballs our way in an acknowledgment that romantic relationships do not always work out in the way we`d like.  Filmmaker John Carney keeps it as simple and intimate in his directorial style as he does in his writing, utilizing an unobtrusive and relatively steady handheld camera that nicely matches the rhythms and beats of the music playing in the background (and often in the foreground).  The scene in which the camera, in a single unbroken shot, moves ahead of Irglova as she strolls along the streets of the city singing an original composition is one of the truly transcendent movie moments of 2007.  And the music itself is lovely, flavorful and memorable - reason alone, I'd say, for seeing the film.In addition to their obvious talents as singers and musicians, Hansard and Irglova give performances of such poignancy and subtle emotion that they draw us instantly into the hearts of their characters.If ""Once"" reminds us of any film, it is probably the French classic, ""A Man and a Woman,"" another work whose tale of romantic love was intimately woven through music (although, in that film, the characters themselves were not singing or composing works).  That's not a bad template for a romantic movie, when you get right down to it.Since ""Once"" is a film that it is much better to experience than it is to read about, I suggest you try it on for yourself.

1113113,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B000X1Z0BU,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[1, 2]","Writer/director John Carney's charming little Irish musical ""Once"" gained steady critical favor since its quiet release into American theaters last year. Now with an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song (and win since this review was first written) its exposure has become more widespread, with its soundtrack selling consistently. Starring two musicians with scant previous acting experience - the Irish Glen Hansard and Czech Marketa Irglova - the film is acutely distinct in that its two principles write and perform the entire score themselves, telling the stories of their respective characters and how their lives intertwine.Emphasis on the value of dreams and loose nature of love imbues the plot, with an understated pathos informing the nature of the characters. In fact, Hansard and Irglova's roles are simply that of Guy and Girl so as to keep things universal. The film has a well-defined charm and niche appeal, but it also wallows in overly sugary romanticism and trite, self-congratulatory art. At least to a degree. If movies could be desserts, ""Once"" would be a creme brulee with its hard, crunchy surface of pure sugar and silky custard underneath - although it leaves a good taste, the film clearly take itself too seriously. Presentation outdoes substance.They may not be trained actors, but Hansard and Irglova are innately endearing with strong screen presence, amplifying Carney's story beyond its rightful realm. Because of this even their most whiney, pedestrian compositions benefit from their cinematic context. If this Guy or Girl were your friends in real life you'd probably encourage them and attend their coffeehouse gigs, yet you would also likely furrow your brow if they sold more than 100 copies of their latest demo. That is not to say that their music is of poor quality. It's not. But grabbing a guitar and howling at the moon about a love gone wrong turns stale pretty fast. Self-pity is not an art form in and of itself, regardless of the fickle taste of late 2000's record buyers. Only listeners with unrefined palettes will find anything offered here groundbreaking.The romantic subtext of the film is well executed because of the characters' clear mutual respect and understanding of each others' different walks of life. Irglova may be half Hansard's age, but that does not compromise the film's integrity. The Guy may be a cliched out of work musician with a job in his father's vacuum repair shop, busking the streets of Dublin in hopes of making spare change, but the way he meets the Girl is engaging and believable.

1113124,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B000X1Z0BU,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","Once (2006)Drama, Music, Romance, 85 minutesDirected by John CarneyStarring Glen Hansard and Marketa IrglovaThe opening scene in Once shows a guy (Hansard) busking. The song is unremarkable, but a few people like it and give him their change. Then, two minutes later, something incredible happens. We see the guy singing at night when the streets are virtually deserted. Although he's alone, he's pouring his heart out using his beaten up guitar and raspy voice.I was hooked from that moment on.When the guy looks up, there's a girl (Irglova) standing there listening. We never learn their names. It's as if the story is more important than the people in it. She gives him 10 cents and they begin talking. He works with his father in a vacuum cleaner repair shop and she has a vacuum cleaner in need of repair. When she brings it the following day, she treats it like a dog on a leash.The two have lunch together and she takes him to a music shop where the owner allows her to play piano. When she plays a piece by Mendelssohn, the guy's jaw drops open in astonishment. She invites him to join her on his guitar and he teaches her how to play one of his songs. That's how they begin their friendship.The setting is Dublin and life isn't easy. The guy and the girl don't have much money. But what does shine through is the Irish sense of community. They love life and the people seem genuine and real. That description also applies to Once.The film was shot on a budget of around 100,000 using two Handycam camcorders, but you'll quickly forget that and focus on the story.The guy has broken up with his girlfriend and she has moved to London. The girl married at a young age, but her husband is back in the Czech Republic and has left her. So there's the possibility of romance and I won't ruin what happens for anyone who hasn't seen the film. What's even more important is their shared love of music. The two have a real connection and she wants to help him reach a wider audience by negotiating the use of a local music studio for the weekend.There are two wonderful reactions later in the film. One comes from Eamon, who is an audio technician at the studio; the other comes from the guy's dad when the guy plays him a CD.The special features mention that over half the film is told through the use of song, but this is not a musical. The songs never make you step outside the story and they come across as totally natural. As well as music, there's plenty of dry humor, but the story is mainly about relationships and pursuing your dreams.Once is one of the most heartwarming stories that I have ever seen. The song Falling Slowly won the Oscar for best song and Hansard and Irglova have toured under the name The Swell Season. It just goes to show that you don't need to spend millions in order to make a film that touches people, and this touched me more than most.In a world which rewards artists with the right look and a manufactured sound, it's refreshing to see people with real passion succeed.The UK Blu-ray is region free, although the special features are audio only unless you use a region B or region free player.",5,An unexpected gem,1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,3131,"['Once', '2006', 'Drama', 'Music', 'Romance', '85', 'minutesDirected', 'John', 'CarneyStarring', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'Marketa', 'IrglovaThe', 'opening', 'scene', 'Once', 'guy', 'Hansard', 'busking', 'song', 'unremarkable', 'few', 'people', 'give', 'change', 'Then', 'two', 'minutes', 'later', 'something', 'incredible', 'happens', 'see', 'guy', 'singing', 'night', 'when', 'streets', 'are', 'virtually', 'deserted', 'alone', 'pouring', 'heart', 'out', 'using', 'beaten', 'up', 'guitar', 'raspy', 'voice.I', 'was', 'hooked', 'moment', 'guy', 'up', 'girl', 'Irglova', 'standing', 'there', 'listening', 'never', 'learn', 'names', 'story', 'more', 'important', 'people', '10', 'cents', 'begin', 'talking', 'father', 'vacuum', 'cleaner', 'repair', 'shop', 'vacuum', 'cleaner', 'need', 'repair', 'When', 'following', 'day', 'dog', 'leash.The', 'two', 'have', 'lunch', 'together', 'music', 'shop', 'where', 'owner', 'play', 'piano', 'When', 'piece', 'Mendelssohn', 'guy', 'jaw', 'open', 'astonishment', 'join', 'guitar', 'how', 'play', 'one', 'songs', 'how', 'begin', 'friendship.The', 'setting', 'Dublin', 'life', ""n't"", 'easy', 'guy', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'money', 'what', 'shine', 'Irish', 'sense', 'community', 'love', 'life', 'people', 'seem', 'genuine', 'real', 'description', 'also', 'Once.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'budget', '100,000', 'using', 'two', 'Handycam', 'camcorders', ""'ll"", 'quickly', 'forget', 'focus', 'story.The', 'guy', 'broken', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'moved', 'London', 'girl', 'married', 'young', 'age', 'husband', 'back', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'left', 'possibility', 'romance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'what', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'shared', 'love', 'music', 'two', 'have', 'real', 'connection', 'help', 'reach', 'wider', 'audience', 'negotiating', 'use', 'local', 'music', 'studio', 'are', 'two', 'wonderful', 'reactions', 'later', 'film', 'One', 'Eamon', 'who', 'audio', 'technician', 'studio', 'other', 'guy', 'dad', 'when', 'guy', 'CD.The', 'special', 'features', 'mention', 'film', 'told', 'use', 'song', 'not', 'musical', 'songs', 'never', 'make', 'step', 'story', 'come', 'totally', 'natural', 'As', 'well', 'music', 'plenty', 'dry', 'humor', 'story', 'mainly', 'relationships', 'pursuing', 'dreams.Once', 'one', 'most', 'heartwarming', 'stories', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'song', 'Falling', 'Slowly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'song', 'Hansard', 'Irglova', 'have', 'toured', 'name', 'Swell', 'Season', 'just', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'spend', 'millions', 'order', 'make', 'film', 'people', 'touched', 'more', 'most.In', 'world', 'artists', 'right', 'look', 'manufactured', 'sound', 'refreshing', 'see', 'people', 'real', 'passion', 'succeed.The', 'UK', 'Blu-ray', 'region', 'free', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'audio', 'only', 'use', 'region', 'B', 'region', 'free', 'player']",Once

You should not.

One day, a young lady (Marketa Irglova), a Czech immigrant, begins to ask him questions about his music, his passions, the inspiration for his ballads. They form a friendship and she encourages him to follow his dream and put together a demo album. As the friendship grows, she helps him negotiate a recording studio and practice the songs. In the process, she invites him into her home, to meet her mother and young daughter. During the course of their relationship, they grow closer, but she is still married and can't let anything happen. They round up some other musicians and begin to work on the demo, to help him with his dream.""Once"", written and directed by John Carney, is a very intimate look at the relationship between these two people. A lot of handheld camera work, close shots and grungy, real locations help to give the film an incredible cinema verite look and style. The camera work is handheld, but not overly shaky, creating shots with an intimate, close appearance, really thrusting us into the middle of the action.The relationship between Guy and Girl (as they are listed in the credits) is really an interesting one that draws you into their lives. Initially, the guy is a bit put off by the girl, she is extremely chatty and forthcoming, asking him a lot of questions about his music, why he sings certain songs, the inspiration, etc. As a street musician, he is naturally a little weary about people getting too close, he simply wants them to enjoy a little of the music and drop a couple of coins or bills into his guitar case and leave. So, the young woman who stops to ask questions, in her accented English, is a minor annoyance, until he realizes she is genuinely interested.As their relationship grows, he feels a fondness for her, and as a single man, he naturally flirts with her. But when she realizes this is going too far, she gives him a little look, a minor reprimand, and he realizes she is right. They are friends, sharing an experience. And she is married, even if her husband still lives in the Czech Republic and they are having problems.As they become friends, they become involved in each other's lives. He meets her mother and daughter, sees where she lives, has dinner at their house. She meets his dad and becomes involved in his making of a demo album.When the duo shows up at the recording studio, with their fellow street musicians, the sound engineer greets them, but secretly reveals his true feelings to someone on his cell phone. He has a feeling this group is another example of people with too much ambition and not enough talent; they don't even know the technical details of recording the music. But when they start playing, he recognizes they have talent, the songs are good, and the lead singer, our guy, is quite good, so he becomes engrossed in making the demo as good as possible. He becomes a part of their team, investing part of himself in the production of the demo.Part of the beauty of ""Once"" is that nothing seems forced. They don't have sex, simply to make the story more dramatic. In fact, the course of their relationship seems all the more real because they simply remain friends, close friends invested in each other's lives and livelihood. There aren't any manufactured crises involving her mother and baby or his dad. They simply struggle with real life.Also, the music is quite good throughout the film. Guy sings a song, a love ballad he wrote for his girlfriend who moved away to London, a few times, each time making it a little better. Finally, when they record it for the demo, it is as good as it could be, with the girl playing keyboard and singing backup and the addition of the other musicians they have recruited.""Once"" is a film about the guy following his dream. He wants to make a demo and travel to London, to try to get a contract. But perhaps more importantly, he wants to reunite with his girlfriend. All he needs is a little push, a little support and guidance from a friend. He finds that friendship with the girl, his new friend who helps him realize he should go for his dream.",5,"""Once"" Is A Real Find",1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,4473,"['Once', 'real', 'find', 'story', 'street', 'musician', 'who', 'Czech', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'streets', 'downtown', 'Dublin', 'believable', 'well-made', 'film', 'love', 'dreams', 'making', 'things', 'happen.Guy', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'real', 'musician', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'film', 'Commitments', 'street', 'busker', 'who', 'heart', 'out', 'streets', 'Dublin', 'dad', 'vacuum', 'repair', 'shop', 'One', 'day', 'young', 'lady', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'Czech', 'immigrant', 'ask', 'questions', 'music', 'passions', 'inspiration', 'ballads', 'form', 'friendship', 'follow', 'dream', 'put', 'together', 'demo', 'album', 'friendship', 'negotiate', 'recording', 'studio', 'practice', 'songs', 'process', 'home', 'meet', 'mother', 'young', 'daughter', 'course', 'relationship', 'grow', 'closer', 'still', 'married', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'anything', 'happen', 'round', 'up', 'other', 'musicians', 'begin', 'work', 'demo', 'help', 'dream', 'Once', 'written', 'directed', 'John', 'Carney', 'very', 'intimate', 'look', 'relationship', 'two', 'people', 'lot', 'handheld', 'camera', 'work', 'close', 'shots', 'grungy', 'real', 'locations', 'help', 'give', 'film', 'incredible', 'cinema', 'verite', 'look', 'style', 'camera', 'work', 'handheld', 'not', 'overly', 'shaky', 'creating', 'shots', 'intimate', 'close', 'appearance', 'really', 'thrusting', 'middle', 'action.The', 'relationship', 'Guy', 'Girl', 'are', 'listed', 'credits', 'really', 'interesting', 'one', 'lives', 'Initially', 'guy', 'bit', 'put', 'off', 'girl', 'extremely', 'chatty', 'forthcoming', 'asking', 'lot', 'questions', 'music', 'why', 'certain', 'songs', 'inspiration', 'etc', 'street', 'musician', 'naturally', 'little', 'weary', 'people', 'getting', 'too', 'close', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'little', 'music', 'drop', 'couple', 'coins', 'bills', 'guitar', 'case', 'leave', 'So', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'ask', 'questions', 'accented', 'English', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'genuinely', 'interested.As', 'relationship', 'grows', 'fondness', 'single', 'man', 'naturally', 'when', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'little', 'look', 'minor', 'reprimand', 'right', 'are', 'friends', 'sharing', 'experience', 'married', 'even', 'husband', 'still', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'are', 'having', 'become', 'friends', 'become', 'involved', 'other', 'lives', 'mother', 'daughter', 'where', 'dinner', 'house', 'dad', 'involved', 'making', 'demo', 'duo', 'up', 'recording', 'studio', 'fellow', 'street', 'musicians', 'sound', 'engineer', 'greets', 'secretly', 'true', 'feelings', 'someone', 'cell', 'phone', 'feeling', 'group', 'example', 'people', 'too', 'much', 'ambition', 'not', 'enough', 'talent', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'technical', 'details', 'recording', 'music', 'when', 'start', 'playing', 'have', 'talent', 'songs', 'are', 'good', 'lead', 'singer', 'guy', 'quite', 'good', 'engrossed', 'making', 'demo', 'as', 'good', 'possible', 'part', 'team', 'investing', 'part', 'production', 'demo.Part', 'beauty', 'Once', 'nothing', 'forced', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sex', 'simply', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'dramatic', 'fact', 'course', 'relationship', 'more', 'real', 'simply', 'remain', 'friends', 'close', 'friends', 'invested', 'other', 'lives', 'livelihood', 'are', ""n't"", 'manufactured', 'crises', 'involving', 'mother', 'baby', 'dad', 'simply', 'struggle', 'real', 'life.Also', 'music', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'Guy', 'song', 'love', 'ballad', 'wrote', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'moved', 'away', 'London', 'few', 'times', 'time', 'making', 'little', 'better', 'Finally', 'when', 'record', 'demo', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'girl', 'playing', 'keyboard', 'singing', 'backup', 'addition', 'other', 'musicians', 'have', 'recruited', 'Once', 'film', 'guy', 'following', 'dream', 'make', 'demo', 'travel', 'London', 'try', 'get', 'contract', 'perhaps', 'more', 'importantly', 'reunite', 'girlfriend', 'little', 'push', 'little', 'support', 'guidance', 'friend', 'friendship', 'girl', 'new', 'friend', 'who', 'realize', 'should', 'go', 'dream']",Once

Trying to make one as an independent feature minus all the Hollywood gloss and big production numbers is even tougher but then this film isn't your typical combination of music, drama and romance.""Once"" manages to be both bold and marvelous at the same time. This delightful film tells the story of an Irish musician (Glen Hansard) who falls for a classically trained piano player and Czech immigrant (Marketa Irglova) who is living with her daughter and mother. The two discover a surprising musical compatibility as well in addition to their unexpected romance. A small independent release that disappeared from theaters as quickly as it opened, ""Once"" is one of those films that you can delightfully discover as it moves on to its second life on home video without feeling guilty about the quality.Hansard who plays in the rock band Frames brings his character to life as much through song as he does through performance. Written and directed by Hansard's band mate John Carney, the film takes a bit to take off but once it does it soars. This isn't your fantasy musical however and Carney doesn't shy away from showing the hardship that two street musicians face in a world that largely gives them an unsympathetic ear.The film looks quite good on DVD considering its low budget nature and feeling that it was shot on the fly. Audio sounds quite good as well with a crisp, clear quality that one might not expect on an independent film such as this.We get an observant and intelligent commentary track by director Carney and his stars. They discuss everything from their characters in the film to making music. There is also a track specific commentary track with the trio as well. ""Making a Modern Day Musical"" is a very good featurette that focuses on the challenges that Carney faced with the musical genre as well as the difficulties he and the cast faced in trying to pull it off convincingly. ""More Guy, More Girl"" focuses on the unnamed main characters and their relationship.
