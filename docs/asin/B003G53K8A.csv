He becomes infatuated by a woman in the window across, and she had a Chinese fan and he was mesmerized by her beauty and the fan.  She turns out to be a thief.There was nothing here that made sense, the acting was bad, the storyline was bad, he falls in love with her within two seconds, no romanticizing, nothing to make you want to get to know the characters.  Nothing to grab on with this movie.  Although it was a simple story, it was unbelievable, ridiculous even.Now, I have seen hundreds of foreign film, with some of the best actors, and best directors.  I know a good film when I see one.  A good film has to draw the viewer in, hold them, captivate them, not muddle through.The film begins boring, muddles through, and ends boring!  .......Rizzo",1,Skip this.... how dumb can an accountant be?,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,867,"['Portugese', 'film', 'basically', 'story', 'young', 'accountant', 'who', 'went', 'work', 'uncle', 'Francisco', 'infatuated', 'woman', 'window', 'had', 'Chinese', 'fan', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'beauty', 'fan', 'out', 'be', 'thief.There', 'was', 'nothing', 'here', 'made', 'sense', 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'storyline', 'was', 'bad', 'love', 'two', 'seconds', 'romanticizing', 'nothing', 'make', 'want', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'Nothing', 'grab', 'movie', 'was', 'simple', 'story', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'ridiculous', 'even.Now', 'have', 'seen', 'hundreds', 'foreign', 'film', 'best', 'actors', 'best', 'directors', 'know', 'good', 'film', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'good', 'film', 'draw', 'viewer', 'hold', 'captivate', 'not', 'muddle', 'through.The', 'film', 'boring', 'muddles', 'boring', '.Rizzo']",N/A
1344849,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B003G53K8A,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[9, 10]","This is another gem by Manoel de Oliveira. It runs a very compact 64 minutes (most of his recent work has had short running times), but it manages to feel longer, not because it is boring, but because it is so well told and uses every minute of its 64 minute running time so well.  It is a masterful film, fascinating, well acted, sublime, and very funny at times.  The cinematography is stunning, especially in a scene at a rich man's salon/house where most of the scenes are lit by candlelight.  It also has a very ambiguous ending, typical of Manoel de Oliveira's film.  Many have said this is one of de Oliveira's best, and I would agree it's one of the best Manoel films that I've seen (and I've seen many of his films).",5,Sharp gem of a film from a master...,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,725,"['gem', 'Manoel', 'de', 'Oliveira', 'very', 'compact', '64', 'minutes', 'most', 'recent', 'work', 'had', 'short', 'running', 'times', 'feel', 'longer', 'not', 'boring', 'so', 'well', 'told', 'minute', '64', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'so', 'well', 'masterful', 'film', 'fascinating', 'well', 'acted', 'sublime', 'very', 'funny', 'times', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'especially', 'scene', 'rich', 'man', 'salon/house', 'where', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'lit', 'candlelight', 'also', 'very', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'typical', 'Manoel', 'de', 'Oliveira', 'film', 'Many', 'have', 'said', 'one', 'de', 'Oliveira', 'best', 'would', 'agree', 'one', 'best', 'Manoel', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'films']",N/A

Teslovich,"[1, 17]","Whenever I encounter a pseudo-intellectual self-indulgent look at me, how clever can I be with made-up layers of interpretation, hidden imagery and obscure symbolism I think back to the nineteenth century parlor intellectual writers who have nothing else to do in life but be pompously in love with their own imagery.What's all that have to do with this movie? Well, that's all it reminded me of as I dozingly nodded through it. It rambled, it wasn't romantic and it wasn't ""realism"". Some hot chick with a prominently portrayed chinese fan that was symbolic of who knows what; a literary club with a prominently displayed bust of who cares; a painting with a finger pointing upward - sophomoric symbolism. A blind woman on a train that doesn't act blind means what?  A guy and a girl are physically attracted to each other from across-street balconies is suppose to symbolize romanticism but when the girl has a shoplifting weakness she is dumped like garbage - that's love?

1344852,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B003G53K8A,Paul Allaer,"[1, 2]","It doesn't happen often anymore, a movie that moves at snail's pace, but this is one of them. ""Eccentricities of a Blonde-Haired Girl"" (64 min.; 2009 release from Portugal) brings the story of an accountant who falls in love on sight with a girl across the street. Short of money (which prevents him for asking for her hand in marriage), the accountant takes some risks, and everything seems to be going well for him to ask the mysterious girl across the street to marry him. But then things fall apart anyway (although the ending is ambiguous). You'll just have to see it for yourself how it all plays out.When I mentioned ""snail's pace"", it is remarkable that so many scenes are just the camera catching the action, with not a single camera movement, at some times for several minutes, just beautiful! I really enjoyed this movie. Given the short running time of the movie, there are plenty of extras on this DVD, including a 70 min. coverage of the movie's director and main actors at the 2009 Berlin movie festival. I watched it for a while but then lost interest. Inall, this movie really engaged me, even though I fully realize it is not for everyone.",4,Beautiful movie at snail's pace,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,1157,"[""n't"", 'happen', 'often', 'anymore', 'movie', 'snail', 'pace', 'one', 'Eccentricities', 'Blonde-Haired', 'Girl', '64', 'min', '2009', 'release', 'Portugal', 'story', 'accountant', 'who', 'love', 'sight', 'girl', 'street', 'Short', 'money', 'asking', 'hand', 'marriage', 'accountant', 'risks', 'everything', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'ask', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'street', 'marry', 'then', 'things', 'fall', 'apart', 'anyway', 'ending', 'ambiguous', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.When', 'mentioned', 'snail', 'pace', 'remarkable', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'camera', 'catching', 'action', 'not', 'single', 'camera', 'movement', 'times', 'several', 'minutes', 'just', 'beautiful', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Given', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'movie', 'are', 'plenty', 'extras', 'DVD', 'including', '70', 'min', 'coverage', 'movie', 'director', 'main', 'actors', '2009', 'Berlin', 'movie', 'festival', 'watched', 'while', 'then', 'lost', 'interest', 'Inall', 'movie', 'really', 'engaged', 'even', 'fully', 'realize', 'not', 'everyone']",N/A
1344853,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003G53K8A,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 8]","""Eccentricities of a Blonde-Haired Girl"" (""Singularidades de uma Rapariga Loura"") opens with a middle-aged man Mac&aacute;rio (Ricardo Trpa) traveling in a train from Lisbon to the Algarve. To a stranger, a lady sitting next to him, the man quietly recounts his personal experiences when he was working in Lisbon as an accountant - the experiences that changed the life of Mac&aacute;rio, who, in the subsequent flashback, falls in love with beautiful Luisa (Catarina Wallenstein), a mysterious woman with a Chinese fan just across the street.Confessional monologue recounting old memories is one of the narrative devices employed in classic literature. In fact, the film is based on the 1873 short story by Ea de Queir&oacute;s (1845-1900), a 19th century Portuguese novelist. He is also the writer of ""The Crime of Father Amaro"" (""O Crime do Padre Amaro""), filmed in 2002 with Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal.The 64-minute picture tells the story of Mac&aacute;rio, helplessly in love, and willing to overcome any obstacles. The slow-moving film is lovely to look at, with the beautiful streets and landscapes of the city of Lisbon, but the veteran director's old-fashioned story-telling - static camera with no soundtrack music, for instance - does not allow us to emotionally relate to any of the characters. We know there is passion buried somewhere deep in the film, which sometimes looks like beautiful tableaux.Some viewers would find ""Eccentricities of a Blonde-Haired Girl"" dull and boring, while others would be fascinated by the rich images and the emotions hidden under them. Manoel de Oliveira has a distinct style and I have only seen some of the films of the Portuguese director (born in 1908), all recent ones such as ""The Convent,"" ""The Going Home,"" ""A Talking Picture"" and ""Crist&oacute;vo Colombo - O Enigma,"" and I still don't know what to make of his films, which is what we call ""an acquired taste.""To me ""Eccentricities of a Blonde-Haired Girl"" is the most accessible film among what I have seen, but for all its beauty and intelligence, the film puzzles me, with its measured pace that surely is off-putting to some.",3,Beautiful Little Film That Is Unique ...
