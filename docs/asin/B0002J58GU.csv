On the way they are encumbered be some bad guys with their own agendas.I will not go into detail but those loyal to the book and/or familiar with the Stewart Granger version may be disappointed. Thos uneducated may enjoy it to the end.Very few videos can match or best a book. And this one does not. Yet it does top most of the others attempts as a variation on the story. Being long enough it could have been the book. But it is someone else's idea of what we want to see.  This is well worth watching as its own variation on the story they added a few twists turns and characters. They are probably trying to as an Indiana Jones feel.

The only minor complaint I have about the movie was with the actress who portrayed Elizabeth.  Although a talented actress, I feel that her look was too contemporary for the setting of the movie.  Her eyebrows were too thin and her bleached blonde hair too artificial for the time period.  In fact in one of the last scenes when she and Patrick Swayze's character were lying on the ground kissing, you can see her obvious very dark grown-out roots.

837063,A15LP6QH9UXJTA,B0002J58GU,Thomas C. Banks,"[31, 33]","Clearly, King Solomon's Mines is made for television. That's its main weakness. The movie, probably a miniseries, is drawn out to fill nearly 3 hours. It's never boring but it lacks the cleverness and frequent action of a movie like Raiders of the Lost Ark, the gold standard for such adventure yarns. The characters and plot are interesting enough to keep you viewing. Some of the characters like the evil African king and his witch doctor are surprisingly very good, if only minor roles. Patrick Swayze puts in a credible performance as do most of the supporting cast. The cinematography is generally very well done and some of the scenery is eye popping. A little more budget and we might have actually gotten a decent tour of the mine filled with traps, treasure, twists, turns, and wonderous sights. Alas, that's not really the payoff here.

837065,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0002J58GU,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","Hallmark's 2004 miniseries version of King Solomon's Mines ain't exactly H. Rider Haggard, but it ain't exactly bad either. As usual with Hallmark (and all other screen adaptations of the book) it pays only lip service to the novel, keeping the trek and the fabled mines but shoehorning in female love interest (a still beautiful Alison Doody in a role that mercifully avoids the silly screaming woman spraining her ankle clich&eacute;s that this kind of film usually attracts), but for the most part doesn't go the Indiana Jones route. It's a tad more politically correct than the source material, with Allan Quatermain (Patrick Swayze - yes, that's right, Patrick Swayze) a reluctant Great White Hunter only persuaded to go on one more expedition because he needs money to fight for custody of his son in England. What he's doing in England is a moot point, since Swayze is more cowboy than Quatermain, but since Roy Marsden and John Standing are the only members of the supporting cast who don't have to attempt (and fail) to hide their native South African accents behind bad Scottish or Russian ones it's best to let that slide. It never really hits the highs and round the two hour mark you realise it's not going to: it maintains a fairly level pace with no appreciable highs or lows. With Russian agents of the Tsar on their trail and World Music on the soundtrack, it's less a nightmare journey to Hell and back and more a somewhat uneventful leisurely walk through some nice tax-friendly South African scenery with occasional stops for exchanges of badly aimed gunfire until the rootin' tootin' sharpshootin' Quatermain Kid saves the day by fighting a white stuntman in rather obvious blackface makeup and makes it to the rather unimpressively tiny mines in a visibly underbudgeted anticlimax.

It's got something for just about everyone: fatherhood tested, family loyalty, evil pursuers, magical treasures, and a last-minute romantic interest. Swayze does a fair job in the title role. He seems to be maturing as an actor and does a good job here, but certainly won't be taking any new roles that require male beauty.This appears to be a TV mini-series, with all the pieces strapped together into one feature film. That seems to explain a lot of the slightly discordant notes. There aren't many special effects here, but that works just fine. The pace and action are more subdued than you'd expect in a regular movie, but the it keeps plugging along at a fair pace. It even steps over the jumps between segments without stumbling, mostly.  Swayze's ""loyal father"" role may not be true to a story written so long ago, but is almost a checkbox item for establishing a 21st century male character as a good guy. The romantic interest seems to pop abruptly out of nowhere, as if the scriptwriters got to the last segment and realized they'd forgotten something. Well, I've seen lots worse.This is longish, almost three hours, but never seemed to drag. It's a bit tame by theatrical standards, but moves along well and won't offend those who prefer chaste flicks. Maybe you could do better than this one, but you could certainly do worse.//wiredweird",3,Passable entertainment,1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,1466,"['fair', 'action/adventure', 'movie', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'lines', 'Quartermain', 'was', 'there', 'long', 'Indy', 'got', 'something', 'just', 'everyone', 'fatherhood', 'tested', 'family', 'loyalty', 'evil', 'pursuers', 'magical', 'treasures', 'last-minute', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Swayze', 'fair', 'job', 'title', 'role', 'be', 'maturing', 'actor', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'taking', 'new', 'roles', 'require', 'male', 'beauty.This', 'be', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'pieces', 'strapped', 'together', 'one', 'feature', 'film', 'explain', 'lot', 'slightly', 'discordant', 'notes', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'special', 'effects', 'here', 'just', 'fine', 'pace', 'action', 'are', 'more', 'subdued', ""'d"", 'expect', 'regular', 'movie', 'plugging', 'along', 'fair', 'pace', 'even', 'jumps', 'segments', 'stumbling', 'mostly', 'Swayze', 'loyal', 'father', 'role', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'story', 'written', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'almost', 'checkbox', 'item', 'establishing', '21st', 'century', 'male', 'character', 'good', 'guy', 'romantic', 'interest', 'pop', 'abruptly', 'nowhere', 'scriptwriters', 'got', 'last', 'segment', 'realized', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'something', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lots', 'worse.This', 'longish', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'never', 'seemed', 'drag', 'bit', 'tame', 'theatrical', 'standards', 'moves', 'along', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'offend', 'who', 'prefer', 'chaste', 'flicks', 'Maybe', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'one', 'could', 'certainly', 'do', 'worse.//wiredweird']",N/A
