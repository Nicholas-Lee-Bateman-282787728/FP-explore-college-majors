24247,A2HVL790PBWYTU,078002057X,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Onscreen, Rex Harrison exudes an innate prickliness that sometimes makes it challenging to pull for him. Vivien Leigh, then 23 years old, when asked, reportedly balked at doing pratfalls. Nevertheless, 1937's Storm in a Teacup is a delightful see. It's a marvelous British comedy of manners that, at times, gets rather raucous.Somewhere on the Scottish West Coast, in the tiny town of Baikie, haughty highlands lass Victoria Gow (Leigh) has returned home, fresh off from finishing her finishing school. She disembarks from the boat just in time to sit on a child's lollipop and, somewhen here, she makes the acquaintance of rumpled reporter Frank Burdon (Harrison, in his first big starring role). In her attempts to clean up her sticky candy-coated dress, he politely asks her, ""Would you like some spit?"" This ought to give you a sense of how chippy their interactions would be, because Victoria wasn't at all amused by his stab at wry witticism.They part ways but their worlds soon re-collide. See, Victoria's father happens to be the Provost, William Gow (Cecil Parker), an ambitious political figure and an ogre of a man. For this and that reason, our reporter Frank Burdon decides to champion the cause of a poor local woman (Sara Allgood) whose dog the Provost had caused to be impounded, seeing as how the woman couldn't afford the cost of a dog license. The movie unveils the comic uproar that ensues.This is the first of two films that paired up Rex Harrison and Vivien Leigh, and, lo, I wonder how eventful the shooting on those sets must have been. What's undeniable is that the two leads develop a nice chemistry. See Leigh's hot-tempered highlands heiress tamed by love. See Harrison deliver a very British interpretation of those fast-talking American newshounds that so typified 1930s screwball cinema. Tempestuous temperaments and rolling, old guard diction everywhere, with grand character actor Cecil Parker very much throwing in his two cents. Credit whoever wrote the screenplay for lending depth and complexity to the characters. I appreciate that the movie's projected big bad is revealed to have more sides to him than mere high-handedness and naked ambition. I love that, even though he's shouted down (or, rather, barked down) by the populace in a political rally and the mob begins calling for his blood, the Provost had guts enough to walk thru the jeering crowd and lead his daughter to safety.The Brits' rep is that of the well-behaved, buttoned-down folk, except that it's again demonstrated here that they, too, can raise a ruckus. I'll expand on that only with this: avalanche of dogs, watch for it. The comedy bits are just wonderfully handled. Storm in a Teacup is populated by droll and offbeat characters, none more delightful to me than Margaret, the parlor maid who exhibits an affinity for American slang. Anyway, this film is very much reminiscent of an Ealing Studio picture, for those who love that sensible-gone-manic flavor. And don't worry, no dogs were injured in the making of this movie. I can't say the same for people or household goods. That was a very impressive avalanche of dogs.Maybe this is interesting: During shooting, director Victor Saville fell ill and had to bow out for a time. When he recovered and returned to the set, he recommended to Vivien Leigh a book he had read while convalescing, remarking that the part of the female lead would be ideal for her if ony she weren't British. The book?

24248,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,078002057X,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[3, 3]","""Storm in a Teacup"" is a British satire - filmed in the early 1930's- of American screwball comedy. It struck me just odd and mesmerizing at same time - seeing Vivien Leigh and Rex Harrison very early in their careers playing off-beat charming characters. Rex Harrison (I hardly recognized him) plays a English reporter (Frank Brudon) who lands in a small Scottish town.  He gets an interview (it even shows him taking Greg Shorthand) with the Provost (Cecil Parker) who is dictating his achievements and full of himself.  Brudon changes the story around to focus on an ice cream vendor, Mrs. Hegarty, who won't buy her dog a license and the Provost, along with other authorities, threaten to kill it.  The revised story sparks a revolt in the small town and threatens the positions of people in power.One scene stuck out as goofy as Brudon was eating oatmeal, salting, buttering it - trying to get it down - and exclaiming he did not know how the Scotts ate porridge for breakfast every morning.  We even get a close-up of the bowl of oatmeal that he exclaims horses should eat.  Another scene involves the Scottish game of golf played with Rex and Vivian Leigh (who plays the Provost's daughter).  There is much dialogue on when Vivian Leigh should call ""Fore!"" - before or after she hits the ball.  I sat there wondering why I thought this was interesting.Political pettiness is magnified through the goofy plot that Mrs. Hegarty's dog is impounded because it had no license.  There is a fine that could have been paid by anyone at anytime, but the whole film dithers around the dog and its license.  All the local officials and elites give fuel to the insane situations ending up in a court of law with crazy witnesses and pompous officials.""Storm in a Teacup"" is such an odd movie, I don't think I can erase it from my mind. The satire was soft, but definitely there.  It is such an early film with dry, dry humor it is worth the watch for a few smiles and look at earliest work of Leigh and Harrison.",4,"Political Satire, and Light, Wacky Comedy",1283904000,"09 8, 2010",2010,2006,"['Storm', 'Teacup', 'British', 'satire', 'filmed', 'early', ""1930's-"", 'American', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'struck', 'just', 'odd', 'mesmerizing', 'same', 'time', 'seeing', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'very', 'early', 'careers', 'playing', 'off-beat', 'charming', 'characters', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'hardly', 'recognized', 'English', 'reporter', 'Frank', 'Brudon', 'who', 'small', 'Scottish', 'town', 'interview', 'even', 'taking', 'Greg', 'Shorthand', 'Provost', 'Cecil', 'Parker', 'who', 'dictating', 'achievements', 'full', 'Brudon', 'story', 'focus', 'ice', 'cream', 'vendor', 'Mrs.', 'Hegarty', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'dog', 'license', 'Provost', 'other', 'authorities', 'threaten', 'kill', 'revised', 'story', 'revolt', 'small', 'town', 'positions', 'people', 'power.One', 'scene', 'stuck', 'out', 'as', 'goofy', 'Brudon', 'was', 'eating', 'oatmeal', 'salting', 'buttering', 'trying', 'get', 'down', 'exclaiming', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'Scotts', 'ate', 'porridge', 'breakfast', 'morning', 'even', 'get', 'close-up', 'bowl', 'oatmeal', 'horses', 'should', 'eat', 'scene', 'Scottish', 'game', 'golf', 'played', 'Rex', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'who', 'Provost', 'daughter', 'much', 'dialogue', 'when', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'should', 'call', 'Fore', 'ball', 'sat', 'wondering', 'why', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting.Political', 'pettiness', 'magnified', 'goofy', 'plot', 'Mrs.', 'Hegarty', 'dog', 'impounded', 'had', 'license', 'fine', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'paid', 'anyone', 'anytime', 'whole', 'film', 'dithers', 'dog', 'license', 'local', 'officials', 'elites', 'give', 'fuel', 'insane', 'situations', 'ending', 'up', 'court', 'law', 'crazy', 'witnesses', 'pompous', 'officials', 'Storm', 'Teacup', 'odd', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'erase', 'mind', 'satire', 'was', 'soft', 'definitely', 'there', 'such', 'early', 'film', 'dry', 'dry', 'humor', 'watch', 'few', 'smiles', 'look', 'earliest', 'work', 'Leigh', 'Harrison']",N/A

He is Frank Burdon (Rex Harrison), recently arrived in Baikie to begin employment with its newspaper. ""The Advertiser"", and it is Frank's willfulness that brings trouble upon himself as well as for others.  In spite of romantic mutual attraction between Frank and Gow's daughter Victoria (Vivien Leigh), the dauntless reporter is well pleased to find a strong human interest slant within Mrs. Hegarty's plight and composes a story that immediately is spread throughout Scotland, therewith effectively putting an end to Gow's political ambitions, as he was preparing to stand for a parliamentary post, an aspiration that has apparently gone a-glimmering due to the Patsy affair, with the Provost moved to exact redress from Burdon by suing him for slander, an action that summons the probability of a final break between Frank and Vickie Gow.  The film is constructed upon a play, ""Storm Over Patsy"", written in 1930 by German expatriate to the United States Bruno Frank, who settled in Hollywood as a screenwriter.  It was rephrased for its exhibition upon the American stage by Glaswegian James Bridie and mounted with a good deal of success during 1936 and 1937 upon Broadway, the production generally featuring vocative Allgood in addition to Leo G. Carroll as Willie Gow.  The provincial complexion of Baikie is more clearly rendered upon the screen than the boards, and fortunately Alexander Korda supplies adequate funding to furnish what he intends as a ""small"" film with significant numbers of extras along with a gaily embellished mise-en-sc&egrave;ne.  A contemporaneous review of the picture by producer/director/critic Basil Wright, published in The Spectator, expanded the amiable film's popularity, and it has retained a following because of its colourful scenes and characters, but a viewer will make note as well of superb costuming and, as must be expected, a superior performance by Parker who handily annexes the acting laurels here.",3,"Early Chapter Of Vivien Leigh's Film Portfolio Is In Substance A Pre-Ealing Production, Albeit With Strong Elements Providing St",1196640000,"12 3, 2007",2007,2363,"['Widowed', 'Mrs.', 'Hegarty', 'Sara', 'Allgood', 'ice', 'cream', 'peddler', 'residing', 'fictive', 'West', 'Scottish', 'coast', 'village', 'Baikie', 'sole', 'companion', 'dog', 'Patsy', 'pay', 'annual', 'canine', 'licensing', 'fee', 'Provost', 'Mayor', 'Baikie', 'William', 'Gow', 'Cecil', 'Parker', 'animal', 'be', 'dispatched', 'thereby', 'inciting', 'titular', 'tempest', 'young', 'English', 'journalist', 'largely', 'responsible', 'Frank', 'Burdon', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'recently', 'arrived', 'Baikie', 'begin', 'employment', 'newspaper', 'Advertiser', 'Frank', 'willfulness', 'trouble', 'upon', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'spite', 'romantic', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'Frank', 'Gow', 'daughter', 'Victoria', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'dauntless', 'reporter', 'well', 'pleased', 'find', 'strong', 'human', 'interest', 'slant', 'Mrs.', 'Hegarty', 'plight', 'story', 'immediately', 'spread', 'Scotland', 'therewith', 'effectively', 'putting', 'end', 'Gow', 'political', 'ambitions', 'was', 'preparing', 'stand', 'parliamentary', 'post', 'aspiration', 'apparently', 'gone', 'a-glimmering', 'due', 'Patsy', 'affair', 'Provost', 'moved', 'exact', 'redress', 'Burdon', 'suing', 'slander', 'action', 'probability', 'final', 'break', 'Frank', 'Vickie', 'Gow', 'film', 'constructed', 'play', 'Storm', 'Patsy', 'written', '1930', 'German', 'expatriate', 'United', 'States', 'Bruno', 'Frank', 'who', 'settled', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'was', 'rephrased', 'exhibition', 'American', 'stage', 'Glaswegian', 'James', 'Bridie', 'mounted', 'good', 'deal', 'success', '1936', '1937', 'Broadway', 'production', 'generally', 'featuring', 'vocative', 'Allgood', 'addition', 'Leo', 'G.', 'Carroll', 'Willie', 'Gow', 'provincial', 'complexion', 'Baikie', 'more', 'clearly', 'rendered', 'screen', 'boards', 'fortunately', 'Alexander', 'Korda', 'supplies', 'adequate', 'funding', 'furnish', 'what', 'small', 'film', 'significant', 'numbers', 'extras', 'gaily', 'embellished', 'mise-en-sc', 'egrave', 'contemporaneous', 'review', 'picture', 'producer/director/critic', 'Basil', 'Wright', 'published', 'Spectator', 'expanded', 'amiable', 'film', 'popularity', 'retained', 'following', 'colourful', 'scenes', 'characters', 'viewer', 'will', 'make', 'note', 'well', 'superb', 'costuming', 'must', 'be', 'expected', 'superior', 'performance', 'Parker', 'who', 'handily', 'acting', 'laurels', 'here']",N/A
