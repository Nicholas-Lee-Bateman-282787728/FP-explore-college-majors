Lee gets fair treatment. He was a man of sound character and ethical principles. He had a strong belief in God's guiding providence.William T. Sherman, for the most part was treated objectively and fairly. Sherman was no where the 'devil' that those in the South made him out to be. It was his conviction that the only way to end the War was to make every one feel it's terrible consequences. To that end he waged 'Total War' in the south. He was right.All in all this is a good production. I have recommended it and loaned my copy to several friends.

While the general's names are well known, their motivations get a thorough examination. So many of the key players had friends and even kin on ""the other side."" West Point Classmates gives an excellent in-depth look at the early training and molding of values that influenced the sometimes heartbreaking choices these American heroes were forced to make.

665914,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B00005MKOB,Steven Hancock,"[19, 23]","""Civil War Journal"" is a fantastic documentary series that deals with the personal and political struggles in addition to the already-legendary military conflicts. This DVD collects four episodes that deal with the famous commanders of the conflict. The first program shows how West Point classmates would end up commanding troops on both sides of the conflict. The second and third programs showcase the lives of Robert E. Lee and Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. Some points must be taken off for the last documentary, which is about William T. Sherman and the March to the Sea. While it does point out the instances of rape and murder (which, although rare, DID happen), as well as the total destruction of property, did occur on this march, the documentary almost seems to excuse these travesties, which were crimes of war that Sherman was never held accountable for. However, the documentary does point out that he was not only ignorant of these incidences, but was also a racist. It shows that he was a less-than-stellar person, both on the battlefield and off.""Civil War Journal: The Commanders"" is a great introduction to the leaders who would lead both Confederate and Union troops into the bloodiest conflict in America's history.
