326207,A1DRKVXO300RUE,6302658543,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","I got to this movie via Ski School, a movie that proudly sits within my top 15 list. I have a random appreciation for movies. I appreciate the pensive, cinematograhpic and acting beauty of There Will Be Blood, the timeless minimalism of Halloween, and the grandiose action of Transformers.  But yet Ski School has a very special place in my connection, and I hoped that Hot Dog would provide a similar level of satisfaction. A bit through the movie, undeniable plot parallels emerged - there's a skiing competition of the good guys vs the bad guys, the good guys have a long standing champion who readily accepts a new comer replacement, the replacement struggles through 2 love interests, etc.  Stupidly, it took me a bit to realize that Hot Dog was made in 1984, with Ski School in 1991, the inspiration idea emerges.  So for the actual movie, it was fun for a 1984 movie. While Ski School had very little to do with actually skiing (most of the scenes were comic interchanges off-slopes), this movie was much more about skiing, with a lot of cool skiing shots.  The comedy was very muted, not over the top (in a good way) in Ski School. In fact, if on a scale of 0-10, 0 represents Ski School-level absolute comedy, and 10 represents There Will Be Blood-lack of comedy, this is probably somewhere around a 6.  Nonetheless, it was fun to watch, and I especially enjoyed because of the clear inspiration it provided to one of my favs.  A very worthy rental.",3,"Aah, the great ski/comedy genre",1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,1458,"['got', 'movie', 'Ski', 'School', 'movie', 'proudly', 'top', '15', 'list', 'have', 'random', 'appreciation', 'movies', 'appreciate', 'pensive', 'cinematograhpic', 'acting', 'beauty', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'timeless', 'minimalism', 'Halloween', 'grandiose', 'action', 'Transformers', 'yet', 'Ski', 'School', 'very', 'special', 'place', 'connection', 'hoped', 'Hot', 'Dog', 'would', 'provide', 'similar', 'level', 'satisfaction', 'bit', 'movie', 'undeniable', 'plot', 'parallels', 'emerged', 'skiing', 'competition', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'guys', 'have', 'long', 'standing', 'champion', 'who', 'readily', 'new', 'comer', 'replacement', 'replacement', '2', 'love', 'interests', 'etc', 'Stupidly', 'took', 'bit', 'realize', 'Hot', 'Dog', 'was', 'made', '1984', 'Ski', 'School', '1991', 'inspiration', 'idea', 'So', 'actual', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', '1984', 'movie', 'Ski', 'School', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'actually', 'skiing', 'most', 'scenes', 'were', 'comic', 'interchanges', 'off-slopes', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'skiing', 'lot', 'cool', 'skiing', 'shots', 'comedy', 'was', 'very', 'muted', 'not', 'top', 'good', 'way', 'Ski', 'School', 'fact', 'scale', '0-10', '0', 'Ski', 'School-level', 'absolute', 'comedy', '10', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood-lack', 'comedy', 'probably', 'somewhere', '6', 'Nonetheless', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'clear', 'inspiration', 'provided', 'one', 'favs', 'very', 'worthy', 'rental']",N/A

You can definitely see that the folks who made ""Out Cold"" (also good) saw this movie.  It is almost a ""Caddyshack"" of the slopes in a way, with the ""slobs vs. the snobs"" theme running through it.  Some of the actual skiing scenes and the cinematography that go along with them are amazing and hold up quite well today.The synth music is cheesy at times but it was reflective of the time, sort of charming actually. The acting is suspect at times, but overall the characters are compelling and funny at the same time.

She sheds her clothes and the ski slopes are all the better for it!The only problem is that the main girl in the film (played by Tracy N. Smith) is even hotter(!) than Tweed!

I was only a junior at the time, and at know ones surprise, skibums from all three local highschools attended. We all bonded on and off the slopes, so a few beers in the parking lot and we were ready for some ski action. We were not dissapointed, for that time, it was the best ski footage on film, alot has changed in skiing since then, but remember this is 1984. We had a rollicking good time, David Naughton made the film, funny and cocky. Doesen't hurt having Shannon Tweed, playmate of the year for some eyecandy, she prevails. The main character, ""Harkin Banks"" is played by a preppy Patrick Houser who obviously was cast for his looks and not his acting, he is horrible, but again this isn't Citizen Cane, just a fun raunchy ski film for people that love the sport almost as much as life. Some great oneliners, abudant nudity, more important, great skiing, watch for the one skier that gets taken out during tha Banzai race, damn does he hit hard, ouch. Typical 80's fare, but fun with friends.
