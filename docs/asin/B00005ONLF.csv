Lots of action and a plausible script. For that, you could add a star. I enjoyed this enough when I first saw it to search out the source for the story. After all, the narrater tells you at the end of the movie that the story you've just seen is true, and even tells you what happened to the major characters. For that blatant lying, you can knock off 2 stars.This film is ""inspired"" by the actions of one Anthony Tait (for the full story, get the book Hell's Angels Into The Abyss by Yves Lavigne). He was not an abused child as was Sheen's character Daniel Saxon. He was not a cop, though he always wanted to be one, (like Virgil, portrayed by Leon Rippy). Tait was an Alaskan (not Arizona) biker who liked to play cop and snitch to the local police. He belonged to a biker club called the Brothers which was absorbed by the Hell's Angels on Dec. 18, 1982. This gave the cops a snitch inside the Angels. Tait was a likable guy and quickly made friends and before long associated with top Angels like Sonny Barger. The Feds jumped on the opportunity of having a man inside the Hell's Angels. Tait got various bikers to sell him weapons and drugs. They got busted and served various amounts of jail time. No murdered girls in armed robberies, no beating up fellow cops, and while there was a reporter, there was no romance and the real person was nothing like the one portrayed by Fiorentino.There you have it. Take this movie as fictional entertainment. Do not buy into the true story tripe. Makes you wonder how much is really true in all those other movies claiming to be based on true stories, events, people etc. Doesn't it?",3,"Entertaining Movie, But Very Little Truth",1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,1735,"['Entertaining', 'biker', 'movie', 'fine', 'acting', 'Sheen', 'Madsen', 'Vance', 'co.', 'Fiorentino', 'great', 'Lots', 'action', 'plausible', 'script', 'could', 'add', 'star', 'enjoyed', 'enough', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'search', 'out', 'source', 'story', 'narrater', 'end', 'movie', 'story', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'true', 'even', 'tells', 'what', 'happened', 'major', 'characters', 'blatant', 'lying', 'can', 'knock', 'off', '2', 'stars.This', 'film', 'inspired', 'actions', 'one', 'Anthony', 'Tait', 'full', 'story', 'get', 'book', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'Into', 'Abyss', 'Yves', 'Lavigne', 'was', 'not', 'abused', 'child', 'was', 'Sheen', 'character', 'Daniel', 'Saxon', 'was', 'not', 'cop', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'one', 'Virgil', 'portrayed', 'Leon', 'Rippy', 'Tait', 'was', 'Alaskan', 'not', 'Arizona', 'biker', 'who', 'liked', 'play', 'cop', 'snitch', 'local', 'police', 'belonged', 'biker', 'club', 'called', 'Brothers', 'was', 'absorbed', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'Dec.', '18', '1982', 'gave', 'cops', 'snitch', 'Angels', 'Tait', 'was', 'likable', 'guy', 'quickly', 'made', 'friends', 'long', 'associated', 'top', 'Angels', 'Sonny', 'Barger', 'Feds', 'jumped', 'opportunity', 'having', 'man', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'Tait', 'got', 'various', 'bikers', 'sell', 'weapons', 'drugs', 'got', 'busted', 'served', 'various', 'amounts', 'jail', 'time', 'murdered', 'girls', 'armed', 'robberies', 'beating', 'up', 'fellow', 'cops', 'was', 'reporter', 'was', 'romance', 'real', 'person', 'was', 'nothing', 'one', 'portrayed', 'Fiorentino.There', 'have', 'Take', 'movie', 'fictional', 'entertainment', 'Do', 'not', 'buy', 'true', 'story', 'tripe', 'Makes', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'true', 'other', 'movies', 'claiming', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'events', 'people', 'etc', ""n't""]",N/A
672709,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00005ONLF,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 10/11Rate: 710/11: Certainly a much better film than Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man, Beyond the Law is an interesting but mundane look at an undercover cop infiltrating the underworld of bikers and its subculture. Why I say the word ""mundane"" is because we've seen it all before, starting with probably Serpico. So, the topic is nothing new. Moreover, Charlie Sheen, although his films are always watchable, still fails to be deep as an actor as usual, and it has always been the biggest flaw of his career. I just find it so odd, and maybe not, that Michael Madsen decided to do a film called Donnie Brasco after rehashing the same topic already four years earlier in Beyond the Law. At least, I liked him much better in the former, a real good piece of work, similar to that kind of conflict that Johnny Utah had with Bodhi. Another problem with Beyond the Law is that it's not all that convincing. If Larry Ferguson could bring that real biker look to the film like how Michael Mann did for The Jericho Mile with the real prisoners of Folsom State Penitentiary, that would have brought a new respect for the film as a whole. So, it's kind of disappointing. Also, Charlie never really fit in or pass for a real biker because he looks too clean to me. However, I do like the film regardless because the subject matter is interesting, and Charlie Sheen makes it interesting to watch. Watching him to act is almost like seeing his anger for real like how it was for him the past year or so. But of course, it's nothing new due to his long history of alcohol and drug abuse and woman beating ways. Already scarred by her performance in The Last Seduction, I feel Linda Fiorentino does nothing remarkable for Beyond the Law except to give Charlie a gratuitous sex scene.

This takes him to close to the edge where he realizes he has to come out or he may never re-gain his normal life.Michael Madsen does a fantastic job as being the leader of the motorcycle club. Even though you know he is the leader of this dangerous gang of felons and the worse of them all. He and the director give his character an edge that almost makes him likable.
