1693870,A2JJ2GB19X25PZ,B00IARA8PC,"Devin Da Graca ""devontate""","[2, 2]","Me renting ""Small Time"" after some late night On Demand surfing wasn't because I read ""coming-of-age"" in the synopsis. Films of that nature tend to thrive on performances alone and follow a very structured, very calculated formula that rarely brings ingenuity or surprise to the table. What brought me to this independent ""coming-of-age"" flick were two other things mentioned in the synopsis: the fact that it was set at a used car lot and starred ""Breaking Bad's"" Dean Norris as something other than a cop. Coming from a car business background myself and being a fan of Norris, watching ""Small Time"" seemed like a match made in cinema heaven. And, surprisingly, the experimental decision lead me to a satisfying one.The story follows Al Klein (Christopher Meloni) and Ash Martini (Dean Norris), two longtime friends who own a used car lot. When Al's son Freddy (Devon Bostick) graduates from high school and decides to put college on hold for a summer selling cars with his old man, against the better wishes of his mother (Bridget Moynahan), Al has to make some tough choices to shape both Freddy's future and his own.One of the film's strongest points are its characters and their relationships. For a movie that's less than 95 minutes long, it does an impeccable job of establishing histories and catching you up on the moment. The chemistry between Christopher Meloni and Dean Norris, Meloni and Bostick, Meloni and Moynahan- are all first rate and immediately believable. Credit belongs to the script (penned by Joel Surnow with semi-autobiographical experience) and to the actors who sell it. These are a cast of characters who are difficult to leave behind once the credits roll.Another thing ""Small Time"" gets right is the business. The hilarious sales tactics on display here are at times a bit over the top, but are, nevertheless, versions of tactics that are as used as the cars they're peddling. The camaraderie between Meloni and Norris during these exchanges is also highly contagious; selling cars like its a two-on-one basketball game won by assists rather than hogging the ball. As a newcomer to the business, Devon Bostick nails it, transitioning from clueless bystander to over-his-head douche bag rather seamlessly.As a member of the ""coming-of-age"" genre, however, ""Small Time"" does indeed follow a structure designed to eliminate surprise. The story goes where you expect it to and despite being well-acted and set where not a lot of other films bother to spend their time, there are a handful of moments that give off a very sitcomy feel (not to say that this wouldn't make for a good one, by the way, but when you're a 'movie' for a better portion of the running time, being anything else for even a second can be distracting). There's also the nit-picking issue of newer cars cruising the streets of a 1970's Covina, California, but that's the problem with small-budget movies I suppose- it costs money to keep the outside world from getting into your inside one.Minor gripes aside, ""Small Time"" has a bigger impact than its title suggests. It's funny, filled with some wonderfully drawn, wonderfully acted characters, and has a heart that's effectively exposed throughout its short running time; never once treading on manipulative and always genuine.SCORE: B+You can read more of my written reviews on[...]",4,"""Small Time"" Sneaks Up On You Big Time",1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,3335,"['Me', 'renting', 'Small', 'Time', 'late', 'night', 'Demand', 'surfing', 'was', ""n't"", 'read', 'coming-of-age', 'synopsis', 'Films', 'nature', 'tend', 'thrive', 'performances', 'alone', 'follow', 'very', 'structured', 'very', 'calculated', 'formula', 'rarely', 'ingenuity', 'surprise', 'table', 'What', 'brought', 'independent', 'coming-of-age', 'flick', 'were', 'two', 'other', 'things', 'mentioned', 'synopsis', 'fact', 'was', 'set', 'used', 'car', 'lot', 'starred', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Dean', 'Norris', 'something', 'other', 'cop', 'Coming', 'car', 'business', 'background', 'being', 'fan', 'Norris', 'watching', 'Small', 'Time', 'seemed', 'match', 'made', 'cinema', 'heaven', 'surprisingly', 'experimental', 'decision', 'lead', 'satisfying', 'one.The', 'story', 'Al', 'Klein', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'Ash', 'Martini', 'Dean', 'Norris', 'two', 'longtime', 'friends', 'who', 'own', 'used', 'car', 'lot', 'When', 'Al', 'son', 'Freddy', 'Devon', 'Bostick', 'high', 'school', 'put', 'college', 'hold', 'summer', 'selling', 'cars', 'old', 'man', 'better', 'wishes', 'mother', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'Al', 'make', 'tough', 'choices', 'shape', 'Freddy', 'future', 'own.One', 'film', 'strongest', 'points', 'are', 'characters', 'relationships', 'movie', 'less', '95', 'minutes', 'long', 'impeccable', 'job', 'establishing', 'histories', 'catching', 'moment', 'chemistry', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'Dean', 'Norris', 'Meloni', 'Bostick', 'Meloni', 'Moynahan-', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'immediately', 'believable', 'Credit', 'belongs', 'script', 'penned', 'Joel', 'Surnow', 'semi-autobiographical', 'experience', 'actors', 'who', 'sell', 'are', 'cast', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'difficult', 'leave', 'behind', 'credits', 'roll.Another', 'thing', 'Small', 'Time', 'right', 'business', 'hilarious', 'sales', 'tactics', 'display', 'here', 'are', 'times', 'bit', 'top', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'versions', 'tactics', 'are', 'as', 'used', 'cars', ""'re"", 'peddling', 'camaraderie', 'Meloni', 'Norris', 'exchanges', 'also', 'highly', 'contagious', 'selling', 'cars', 'two-on-one', 'basketball', 'game', 'won', 'assists', 'rather', 'hogging', 'ball', 'newcomer', 'business', 'Devon', 'Bostick', 'transitioning', 'clueless', 'bystander', 'over-his-head', 'douche', 'bag', 'rather', 'seamlessly.As', 'member', 'coming-of-age', 'genre', 'however', 'Small', 'Time', 'indeed', 'follow', 'structure', 'designed', 'eliminate', 'surprise', 'story', 'where', 'expect', 'being', 'well-acted', 'set', 'where', 'not', 'lot', 'other', 'films', 'bother', 'spend', 'time', 'are', 'handful', 'moments', 'give', 'off', 'very', 'sitcomy', 'feel', 'not', 'say', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'one', 'way', 'when', ""'re"", ""'movie"", 'better', 'portion', 'running', 'time', 'being', 'anything', 'else', 'even', 'second', 'can', 'be', 'distracting', 'also', 'nit-picking', 'issue', 'newer', 'cars', 'cruising', 'streets', '1970', 'Covina', 'California', 'problem', 'small-budget', 'movies', 'suppose-', 'money', 'keep', 'outside', 'world', 'getting', 'inside', 'one.Minor', 'gripes', 'aside', 'Small', 'Time', 'bigger', 'impact', 'title', 'funny', 'filled', 'wonderfully', 'drawn', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'characters', 'heart', 'effectively', 'exposed', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'never', 'once', 'treading', 'manipulative', 'always', 'genuine.SCORE', 'B+You', 'can', 'read', 'more', 'written', 'reviews', '[', ']']",N/A

1693875,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00IARA8PC,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Every once in a while a small film is released that goes unnoticed by most and yet deserves so much more attention than many of the flashier big name titles that tend to take up 3-4 screens at the local multiplex. Often these films are filled with heart and emotion and steer clear of all the combinations of mega-explosions and special effects. They are films to be treasured and sought out. So let me guide you to one called SMALL TIME.Christopher Maloni stars as Al Klein, a used car salesman who's feeling older with each passing day. Along with his best friend Ash Martini (Dean Norris) they do great business at the lot. But it's his personal life that Al finds upsetting, filled with regrets. None of those is bigger than the life he couldn't provide for his ex-wife (Bridget Moynihan) and son Freddy (Devon Bostick).On his son's graduation day from high school, Al and Ash try to make sure they're there on time. Alas it isn't so but, being the great salesmen they are, they fake their way through it. A clear bond between Al and his son is shown here in subtle ways that only deepen as the film moves forward. This is plain to see when Freddy shows up to talk to Al about the possibility of going to work for him. While his mother wants him to go to college, he feels he can learn more about the real world working for his father.While the parents disagree on this concept, his mother ends up allowing him to follow through with the plan. Freddy moves in with Al and the two find themselves catching up on lost time. His first days at the car lot are filled with mistakes and fumbles and a few lost sales. But this turns as his time at the lot progresses.But as Freddy's sales skills increase so does his disrespect for the people he deals with as well as those around him. Al seems to be the only one who notices this. Having lost the only thing that mattered to him all those years ago, is he willing to let Freddy fall into the same lifestyle that costs him what was most important to him?The movie has a calm cool atmosphere to it, moving along at a steady pace that allows the story to unfold in a manner that suits it well. Some might see the change in Freddy as fast but in truth it's just that the storytelling going on here is so seamless that it only feels that way. The combination of script, directing and acting come together here so perfectly fit that it feels the movie is over before it began. It leaves you wishing you could see what happens down the line.The three male leads here all do an amazing job. Meloni is a master of playing things close to the chest, never revealing all that his character has going on inside of his mind with wasted words. Instead he offers ponderous gazes that convey everything we need to know. Norris turns in another great performance to match those of the past with his character being the more brazen and fun loving of the two. Ash is not someone looking down the line at what is to come but only in the here and now. Al and Ash are two sides of the coin that combine to make a single unit. Both have something to offer Freddy. The problem is Freddy realizing which is the most important and that the two can co-exist and should with neither wiping out the other. Bostick as Freddy does an equally great job with his character making him timid at first only to find himself swelling with far too much hubris later on.Another great thing about this movie is the film's director and writer, Joel Surnow. Known by most for his creation of the series 24 he's also been a writer for years having worked on THE EQUALIZER, FALCON CREST, LA FEMME NIKITA, THE COMMISH and MIAMI VICE. Now he takes a turn at something a little different and does an amazing job.There are plenty of laughs in this film and a number of tender moments as well. It's that combination of the two that make this a film worth watching. It's a film that could be shared between a father and son that would lead to a great conversation. It might have not been a box office smash, but it is a movie that needs to be seen.",5,"SMALL TIME, BIG HEART",1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,4045,"['once', 'while', 'small', 'film', 'released', 'unnoticed', 'most', 'yet', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'attention', 'many', 'flashier', 'big', 'name', 'titles', 'tend', 'take', 'up', '3-4', 'screens', 'local', 'multiplex', 'films', 'are', 'filled', 'heart', 'emotion', 'steer', 'clear', 'combinations', 'mega-explosions', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'films', 'be', 'treasured', 'sought', 'out', 'So', 'let', 'guide', 'one', 'called', 'SMALL', 'TIME.Christopher', 'Maloni', 'Al', 'Klein', 'used', 'car', 'salesman', 'who', 'feeling', 'older', 'passing', 'day', 'best', 'friend', 'Ash', 'Martini', 'Dean', 'Norris', 'do', 'great', 'business', 'lot', 'personal', 'life', 'Al', 'upsetting', 'filled', 'regrets', 'None', 'bigger', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'provide', 'ex-wife', 'Bridget', 'Moynihan', 'son', 'Freddy', 'Devon', 'Bostick', '.On', 'son', 'graduation', 'day', 'high', 'school', 'Al', 'Ash', 'try', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'time', 'Alas', ""n't"", 'so', 'being', 'great', 'salesmen', 'are', 'fake', 'way', 'clear', 'bond', 'Al', 'son', 'shown', 'here', 'subtle', 'ways', 'only', 'deepen', 'film', 'forward', 'plain', 'see', 'when', 'Freddy', 'up', 'talk', 'Al', 'possibility', 'going', 'work', 'mother', 'go', 'college', 'can', 'learn', 'more', 'real', 'world', 'working', 'father.While', 'parents', 'disagree', 'concept', 'mother', 'up', 'allowing', 'follow', 'plan', 'Freddy', 'Al', 'two', 'find', 'catching', 'up', 'lost', 'time', 'first', 'days', 'car', 'lot', 'are', 'filled', 'mistakes', 'fumbles', 'few', 'lost', 'sales', 'time', 'lot', 'progresses.But', 'Freddy', 'sales', 'increase', 'so', 'disrespect', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'Al', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'Having', 'lost', 'only', 'thing', 'mattered', 'years', 'ago', 'willing', 'let', 'Freddy', 'fall', 'same', 'lifestyle', 'what', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'movie', 'calm', 'cool', 'atmosphere', 'moving', 'along', 'steady', 'pace', 'story', 'unfold', 'manner', 'suits', 'well', 'might', 'see', 'change', 'Freddy', 'fast', 'truth', 'just', 'storytelling', 'going', 'here', 'so', 'seamless', 'only', 'way', 'combination', 'script', 'directing', 'acting', 'come', 'together', 'here', 'so', 'perfectly', 'fit', 'movie', 'began', 'wishing', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'down', 'line.The', 'three', 'male', 'here', 'do', 'amazing', 'job', 'Meloni', 'master', 'playing', 'things', 'close', 'chest', 'never', 'revealing', 'character', 'going', 'mind', 'wasted', 'words', 'Instead', 'ponderous', 'gazes', 'convey', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'Norris', 'great', 'performance', 'match', 'past', 'character', 'being', 'more', 'brazen', 'fun', 'loving', 'two', 'Ash', 'not', 'someone', 'looking', 'down', 'line', 'what', 'come', 'only', 'here', 'now', 'Al', 'Ash', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'coin', 'combine', 'make', 'single', 'unit', 'have', 'something', 'offer', 'Freddy', 'problem', 'Freddy', 'realizing', 'most', 'important', 'two', 'can', 'co-exist', 'should', 'wiping', 'out', 'other', 'Bostick', 'Freddy', 'equally', 'great', 'job', 'character', 'making', 'timid', 'first', 'only', 'find', 'swelling', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'hubris', 'later', 'on.Another', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'film', 'director', 'writer', 'Joel', 'Surnow', 'Known', 'most', 'creation', 'series', '24', 'also', 'been', 'writer', 'years', 'having', 'worked', 'THE', 'EQUALIZER', 'FALCON', 'CREST', 'LA', 'FEMME', 'NIKITA', 'THE', 'COMMISH', 'MIAMI', 'VICE', 'Now', 'turn', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'amazing', 'job.There', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'film', 'number', 'tender', 'moments', 'well', 'combination', 'two', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'shared', 'father', 'son', 'would', 'lead', 'great', 'conversation', 'might', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'box', 'office', 'smash', 'movie', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

These two guys, with a staff that includes a mechanic/Spanish-speaking salesman (Amaury Nolasco) and a less than bright office girl (Ashley Jensen), are experts at selling vehicles off their lot, even to the most reluctant buyer.Things change when Meloni&#8217;s son (Devon Bostick), against his mother&#8217;s wishes, decides to forego college and come to work with his father.

1693881,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00IARA8PC,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 0]","&#8220;Small Time&#8221; is the story of Al Klein (Christopher Meloni, &#8220;Law & Order: SVU&#8221;) and his longtime friend, Ash Martini (Dean Norris, &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221;). These two own a used car lot and know every trick in the book when it comes to selling cars. Ash has lived a carefree life, never really settling down. Al still has feelings for his ex-wife, Barbara (Bridget Moynahan, &#8220;Blue Bloods&#8221;), who left him years ago for a more successful man. After graduating from high school, their son, Freddy (Devon Bostick, &#8220;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&#8221;), decides to forgo college in favor of selling cars with his old man. Al is thrilled when Freddy moves in with him. It&#8217;s the first time the two have lived under one roof since Freddy was a kid. Barbara, however, isn&#8217;t at all pleased. She is concerned that what&#8217;s best for Al might not be best for their son, as Freddy quickly transforms from innocent kid into a seasoned shark.This is the first big-screen effort from Joel Surnow (TV&#8217;s &#8220;24&#8221;), who wrote the screenplay and directed. Surnow has based it film at least in part on personal experience. He worked into his mid-twenties with his father as a carpet salesman. With a cast mostly of TV actors, this comedy/drama is appealing in its colorful assortment of characters, but structurally there are problems.Freddy&#8217;s transition from awkward novice in the used car business to fast-talking sharpie occurs too quickly to be believable. Overall, however, the movie effectively shows the developing relationship between a father and son getting to know each other for the first time. This kind of movie &#8212; about real people with real problems &#8212; is being overshadowed these days by superheroes, alien invasions, and computer-fueled spectacles. &#8220;Small Time&#8221; is a refreshing return to character-driven movies.The only special feature on the DVD release is audio commentary with Joel Surnow and actors Christopher Meloni and Dean Norris.",4,Father/Son Bonding on the Used Car Lot,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,2029,"['8220', 'Small', 'Time', '8221', 'story', 'Al', 'Klein', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', '8220', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', '8221', 'longtime', 'friend', 'Ash', 'Martini', 'Dean', 'Norris', '8220', 'Breaking', 'Bad', '8221', 'two', 'own', 'used', 'car', 'lot', 'know', 'trick', 'book', 'when', 'selling', 'cars', 'Ash', 'lived', 'carefree', 'life', 'never', 'really', 'settling', 'down', 'Al', 'still', 'feelings', 'ex-wife', 'Barbara', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', '8220', 'Blue', 'Bloods', '8221', 'who', 'left', 'years', 'ago', 'more', 'successful', 'man', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'son', 'Freddy', 'Devon', 'Bostick', '8220', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', '8221', 'forgo', 'college', 'favor', 'selling', 'cars', 'old', 'man', 'Al', 'thrilled', 'when', 'Freddy', '8217', 's', 'first', 'time', 'two', 'have', 'lived', 'one', 'roof', 'Freddy', 'was', 'kid', 'Barbara', 'however', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'pleased', 'concerned', 'what', '8217', 'best', 'Al', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'son', 'Freddy', 'quickly', 'innocent', 'kid', 'seasoned', 'shark.This', 'first', 'big-screen', 'effort', 'Joel', 'Surnow', 'TV', '8217', '8220', '24', '8221', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'directed', 'Surnow', 'based', 'film', 'least', 'part', 'personal', 'experience', 'worked', 'mid-twenties', 'father', 'carpet', 'salesman', 'cast', 'mostly', 'TV', 'actors', 'comedy/drama', 'appealing', 'colorful', 'assortment', 'characters', 'structurally', 'are', 'problems.Freddy', '8217', 'transition', 'awkward', 'novice', 'used', 'car', 'business', 'fast-talking', 'sharpie', 'too', 'quickly', 'be', 'believable', 'Overall', 'however', 'movie', 'effectively', 'developing', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'first', 'time', 'kind', 'movie', '8212', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'problems', '8212', 'being', 'overshadowed', 'days', 'superheroes', 'alien', 'invasions', 'computer-fueled', 'spectacles', '8220', 'Small', 'Time', '8221', 'refreshing', 'return', 'character-driven', 'movies.The', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'DVD', 'release', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Joel', 'Surnow', 'actors', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'Dean', 'Norris']",N/A
