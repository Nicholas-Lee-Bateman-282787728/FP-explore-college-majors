1671754,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B00FK39O22,Amit Talpade,"[0, 1]","In an interview, Rohit Shetty remarked that he does not make films for the critics and does not care about creating classics. He simply wants to entertain and he makes sure that the person who buys the ticket goes back home as a happy customer. He is doing that aspect of his job especially well, his last three films have entered the coveted 100 crore club the equivalent of a diamond jubilee ( A movie which runs at a single theater consecutively for 50 weeks is considered a diamond jubilee). He is selling a brand of cinema which is colorful, over the top and entertaining. Who understands this notion about branding and popularity than Shahrukh Khan a person who has trademarked his name SRk as a brand. While SRK enjoys undisputed popularity his popularity in India is not what it is used to be, the last time SRk had a humongous hit was with Om Shanti Om- his last few releases even though hits were lackluster by his standards.Eyebrows were raised when Rohit Shetty and SRK joined hands, both had their favorite camps - Shetty with Ajay Devgan and SRK with Yash Chopra and Karan Johar however SRk has had maintained that he did want to try out something different. The results are there for us to see, Chennai Express in its opening weekend smashed many box office records and is on its way to become on the biggest films of this year.I was very apprehensive to watch it because big budget movies are so hyped that the end result is less than satisfactory. However I did and found myself in a packed movie theater sitting on the front row. Did I enjoy the movie? I did so did the others. The movie ended with a standing ovation from the audience.The movie begins with a flashback with a blood bathed SRK- in the film he plays a 40 year old guy who has been assigned to immersing the ashes of his dead grandfather in the waters of Rameswaran. He decides to board the Chennai Express and as the train pulls from the platform ( The most hilarious spoof on DDLJ takes place - please watch this, I got the most laughs from this scene and the rest of the train episode). We are next introduced to Meenamma ( Deepika Padukone)Meenamma has been running away from her father who wants her to marry a boy of his choice- she is guarded by her fathers goons who are taking her back home. This is what ensues in the 143 minutesSRK as usual delivers a over the top, out of control, and energetic performance, the role asks for it. There is effortless acting in his many scenes in the train initially when he taunts the goons and plugs Nokia incessantly. There are many such product plugs throughout the film.His interactions with Tangaballi as he mocks and pokes him throughout the film are fun to watch. There is so much spring in the overacting that it is hard not to like the performance. Loved his banter with the little person- amazing fun. During the entire film he makes fun of his own movies in a way that is hilarious. I hope he continues to work with other directors who have a sense of commercial cinema as well as Shetty. I hope his next film Happy New Year continues to take him higher. Hate SRK or Love him- You will enjoy this one.and finally ""dont underestimate the power of this Khan""Deepika Padukone, the heir apparent to Katrina Kaif delivers yet another performance which assures her a shot of being the next number one actress. Another scene that I laughed was her take off on Vidya Balans act in Bhool Bhoolaiya or her Sauchalay song in the train.Rohit Shetty marries his sense of entertainment with a riot of color and the film is very pretty to look at. Southern India as in Munnar along with Wai and Goa looks gorgeous. He can't restrain himself enough though as he does resort to flying and exploding cars towards the end. The film's story is not path breaking but it is the narrative that keeps us engrossed. Rohit Shetty has all the skill to become a worthy successor to Manmohan Desai.Vishal Shekhar's music is good but not great. I liked Kashmir Main and the final Lungi Dance tribute to Rajnikanth- fun ( Honey Singh composed this one though)I immensely enjoyed Chennai Express, notwithstanding the front row seat. It is a fun, fun, filled film which spoofs many films all done with style and a flavor for which Rohit Shetty is capable of. My views are echoed by the thousands of people around the world and India who have watched it and made it the highest opening for any Indian film ever. Just loved it and will watch it again. 5 stars.8/9/2013",5,Get on this train for a fun filled ride,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,4472,"['interview', 'Rohit', 'Shetty', 'remarked', 'not', 'make', 'films', 'critics', 'not', 'care', 'creating', 'classics', 'simply', 'entertain', 'sure', 'person', 'who', 'ticket', 'back', 'home', 'happy', 'customer', 'doing', 'aspect', 'job', 'especially', 'well', 'last', 'three', 'films', 'have', 'entered', 'coveted', '100', 'crore', 'club', 'equivalent', 'diamond', 'jubilee', 'A', 'movie', 'single', 'theater', 'consecutively', '50', 'weeks', 'considered', 'diamond', 'jubilee', 'selling', 'brand', 'cinema', 'colorful', 'top', 'entertaining', 'Who', 'notion', 'branding', 'popularity', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'person', 'who', 'trademarked', 'name', 'SRk', 'brand', 'SRK', 'undisputed', 'popularity', 'popularity', 'India', 'not', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'SRk', 'had', 'humongous', 'hit', 'was', 'Om', 'Shanti', 'Om-', 'last', 'few', 'releases', 'even', 'hits', 'were', 'lackluster', 'standards.Eyebrows', 'were', 'raised', 'when', 'Rohit', 'Shetty', 'SRK', 'joined', 'hands', 'had', 'favorite', 'camps', 'Shetty', 'Ajay', 'Devgan', 'SRK', 'Yash', 'Chopra', 'Karan', 'Johar', 'however', 'SRk', 'had', 'maintained', 'did', 'want', 'try', 'out', 'something', 'different', 'results', 'are', 'there', 'see', 'Chennai', 'Express', 'opening', 'weekend', 'smashed', 'many', 'box', 'office', 'records', 'way', 'become', 'biggest', 'films', 'year.I', 'was', 'very', 'apprehensive', 'watch', 'because', 'big', 'budget', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'hyped', 'end', 'result', 'less', 'satisfactory', 'However', 'did', 'found', 'packed', 'movie', 'theater', 'sitting', 'front', 'row', 'Did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'did', 'so', 'did', 'others', 'movie', 'ended', 'standing', 'ovation', 'audience.The', 'movie', 'flashback', 'blood', 'bathed', 'SRK-', 'film', '40', 'year', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'assigned', 'immersing', 'ashes', 'dead', 'grandfather', 'waters', 'Rameswaran', 'board', 'Chennai', 'Express', 'train', 'pulls', 'platform', 'most', 'hilarious', 'spoof', 'DDLJ', 'place', 'please', 'watch', 'got', 'most', 'laughs', 'scene', 'rest', 'train', 'episode', 'are', 'next', 'introduced', 'Meenamma', 'Deepika', 'Padukone', 'Meenamma', 'been', 'running', 'away', 'father', 'who', 'marry', 'boy', 'choice-', 'guarded', 'fathers', 'goons', 'who', 'are', 'taking', 'back', 'home', 'what', '143', 'minutesSRK', 'usual', 'delivers', 'top', 'control', 'energetic', 'performance', 'role', 'effortless', 'acting', 'many', 'scenes', 'train', 'initially', 'when', 'goons', 'plugs', 'Nokia', 'incessantly', 'are', 'many', 'such', 'product', 'plugs', 'film.His', 'interactions', 'Tangaballi', 'film', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'so', 'much', 'spring', 'overacting', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'performance', 'Loved', 'banter', 'little', 'person-', 'amazing', 'fun', 'entire', 'film', 'fun', 'own', 'movies', 'way', 'hilarious', 'hope', 'work', 'other', 'directors', 'who', 'have', 'sense', 'commercial', 'cinema', 'as', 'well', 'Shetty', 'hope', 'next', 'film', 'Happy', 'New', 'Year', 'take', 'higher', 'Hate', 'SRK', 'Love', 'him-', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one.and', 'finally', 'dont', 'underestimate', 'power', 'Khan', 'Deepika', 'Padukone', 'heir', 'apparent', 'Katrina', 'Kaif', 'yet', 'performance', 'shot', 'being', 'next', 'number', 'one', 'actress', 'scene', 'laughed', 'was', 'take', 'off', 'Vidya', 'Balans', 'act', 'Bhool', 'Bhoolaiya', 'Sauchalay', 'song', 'train.Rohit', 'Shetty', 'sense', 'entertainment', 'riot', 'color', 'film', 'very', 'pretty', 'look', 'Southern', 'India', 'Munnar', 'Wai', 'Goa', 'gorgeous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'restrain', 'enough', 'resort', 'flying', 'exploding', 'cars', 'end', 'film', 'story', 'not', 'path', 'breaking', 'narrative', 'engrossed', 'Rohit', 'Shetty', 'skill', 'become', 'worthy', 'successor', 'Manmohan', 'Desai.Vishal', 'Shekhar', 'music', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'liked', 'Kashmir', 'Main', 'final', 'Lungi', 'Dance', 'tribute', 'Rajnikanth-', 'fun', 'Honey', 'Singh', 'composed', 'one', 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'Chennai', 'Express', 'notwithstanding', 'front', 'row', 'seat', 'fun', 'fun', 'filled', 'film', 'spoofs', 'many', 'films', 'done', 'style', 'flavor', 'Rohit', 'Shetty', 'capable', 'views', 'are', 'echoed', 'thousands', 'people', 'world', 'India', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'made', 'highest', 'opening', 'Indian', 'film', 'ever', 'Just', 'loved', 'will', 'watch', 'again', '5', 'stars.8/9/2013']",Chennai Express

1671758,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00FK39O22,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","It's a cause for raising eyebrows when, in CHENNAI EXPRESS, Deepika Padukone gets top billing over Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan. And yet somewhen during the second or third acts it may dawn on you that it's Deepika who quietly owns the film. She never fails to bring grace and beauty to the screen. Still, CHENNAI EXPRESS shattered all manner of box office records in India, mostly because of what Shahrukh brings to the table.Me, I vastly prefer the understated Shahrukh who beautifully grounded films such asSwades(2004),Chakde! India(2007), andRab Ne Bana Di Jodi(2008). CHENNAI EXPRESS gives us the other SRK - the over-the-top, overwrought performer. So right away I've this sinking feeling. SRK is Rahul, a sheltered 40-year-old seller of sweets in Mumbai whose life is dictated by his intrusive grandfather. Rahul genuinely loves his grandpa, so when he passes away on his 100th birthday, Rahul experiences a deep sense of loss... but also vast relief. There's one familial duty to carry out: Rahul must scatter half his grandfather's ashes into the sea by Rameshwaram, a place somewhere on the distant southern tip of India. And if you must know, his grandma will scatter the other half of ashes into the Ganga in Anshaund.Except that Rahul is making a bid for independence. He and his friends have already scheduled a holiday jaunt to sunny Goa. It's finally his chance to live life. And so Rahul puts on a deception, informing his grieving grams that he'll take the southbound Chennai Express to Rameshwaram. Truth is, he'll be on that train only until the next stop, from which he'll disembark, hook up with his chums, and motor on to Goa. Except Rahul never does make it to Goa.Rahul's stay on the Chennai Express gets extended when he helps a fleeing Tamil girl get on board, and then he also helps on board the four large, bruising goons chasing her. These goons, who happen to be her cousins, intend to escort her back home. She's Meenamma Lochini (Padukone), daughter to the crime lord of Komban village. Meena, it turns out, is a habitual flight risk. In this instance, she's unhappy that her father has arranged her marriage. At this moment she's eyeballing Rahul, formulating a plan. Maybe the best part of the film happens during the first few minutes of our two leads' sharing screen time. Trying to talk around the goons - who only speak Tamil - Meena and Rahul communicate by hilariously taking turns singing in Hindi. The tunes they belt out should be very familiar to steadfast Bollywood audiences. Heck, I even heard ""Kajra Re"" (my personal jam) all up in there.This is one of those movies in which one common man takes on a throng of thugs and somehow survives. But I appreciate that Rahul doesn't suddenly know kung-fu. Instead he makes use of the things around him to give himself an advantage. He still gets his butt kicked. It's sort of more believable.CHENNAI EXPRESS is a boisterous romantic action comedy, and I rate it 3 out of 5 stars, maybe 3.5 stars, only because the camera is so infatuated with Deepika Padukone and showcases her so beautifully that I'm bewitched each time I set eyes on her. I commend Deepika for having shown growth and range as an actress. I feel that there's weight to her acting. Inasmuch as SRK is the featured attraction, it's Deepika who anchors the film, never you mind that one wonky night scene with Meena's freaky sleeping disorder.CHENNAI EXPRESS is noOm Shanti Om Bollywood DVD With English Subtitles(2007), which was SRK and Deepika's first collaboration. It aims for the same critical success and the same inspired giddiness flaunted by OM SHANTI OM but is hampered by the labored gags and all-around buffoonery. For most of the film, it's as if SRK is channeling Bob Hope or Don Knotts, so focused on self-preservation is his character. There's plenty of him flailing about and running away, and I don't find this endearing. In a twist, it's the damsel who, time and again, has to rescue the hero. If that doesn't throw you off and if you can stomach the lowbrow humor - and, okay, maybe I'm missing out on some comic subtleties because of the cultural divide - then maybe you'll get more enjoyment out of Meena and Rahul's sprawling journey and buy into the film's silly sense of escapism and maybe smirk at the crop of meta-cinematic references to SRK's and director Rohit Shetty's past film catalogue. It's with some reservation and a readiness to duck from hurtful things you'll throw at me that I recommend this movie.What I have is the 2-disc set with the DVD case that feels nicely padded. Disc 1 has the feature film with an option for English sub-titles. Disc 2 has the following bonus stuff:- Making of Chennai Express featurette (00:38:37 minutes long and bits of it in English)- Music Video: ""Lungi Dance"" (featuring rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh)",4,"""Don't underestimate the common of a power man.""",1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,4833,"['cause', 'raising', 'eyebrows', 'when', 'CHENNAI', 'EXPRESS', 'Deepika', 'Padukone', 'top',
