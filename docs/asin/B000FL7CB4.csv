Both as a writer and a performer Lisa Kudrow has shown she is absolutely brilliant.  Her character Valerie is a has-been with a stunning lack of awareness of herself and the industry that has passed her by.  Forced into a humiliating career choice which she believes will be her path back to A-list fame, Valerie despite her previous role is most definitely not it, but she is the only one not to know.The pain begins as her character is progressively marginalized for younger, hipper Friendsoids.  Off screen her attempts to act as mentor and moral center to the cast come off excrutiatingly tone deaf and awkward.  A scene in which we learn that one of her co-stars, who Valerie considers green and ripe for training, is actually a well-seasoned veteran of another entertainment medium is almost tragic.The supporting cast from her personal life is great.  Her loyal puppy of a clueless hairdresser almost steals the show, and her step daughter is brilliant.This is a great, can't miss series, and Kudrow absolutely deserves an Emmy for this work, but don't curl up with it hoping for some charming laughs.

I am even going to be bold enough to state that if you enjoy ""Curb"" or ""The Office"" (British version especailly) then I am very confident you will enjoy this. Lisa Kudrow is perfect as the often oblivious Valerie Cherish and the reality show format works very well especially with Kudrow's Valerie Cherish not really getting the point of a reality show constantly telling the director, ""Time out, Jane."" The only shortcoming I can really pinpoint is that Valerie Cherish lacks a certain humanity. She should come off more sympathetic than she does but that complaint disappears by the end of the series. But in the beginning you don't know whether or not to feel sorry for her and laughing at the sad sack that is Valerie Cherish's life almost seems mean.

992681,A1493DD8LRGOKC,B000FL7CB4,J. Kim,"[6, 6]","Lisa Kudrow proved definitively that she was the most talented actor of all the Friends after her Oscar-worthy performance (I know it's an overused expression, but really, she is THAT good) in The Opposite of Sex, and in The Comeback she blows everyone everyone everyone out of the water.This is a very clever series, a tongue-in-cheek documentary style show based on the making of a documentary-style reality show. Yeah, wrap your mind around that. Anyway, Kudrow is phenomenal, in no small part because the writing she gets to work with (finally!) is worthy of her talent.

It's not always fun to watch (the hijinks of 30 Rock are G-rated in comparison); it's at times shockingly realistic, dark, bitter, and also, weirdly, the funniest thing you will ever see on TV (or HBO, rather).To the reviewers griping about HBO: Depressing as it is, this series sometimes drew less than 1 million viewers when it was on the air, so I can't blame HBO for canceling it, but I agree, what a loss for the few of us who were watching.

But ""The Comeback"" skewers reality shows as well as giving viewers a delicious satire on behind-the-scenes Hollywood.Lisa Kudrow plays Valerie Cherish, trying to make her big ""comeback"" on a new reality show that documents the early '90s sitcom star's struggle to land a new gig in a show called ""Room and Bored"".Along for the ride are Val's put-upon businessman husband she affectionately calls Marky-Mark (Damian Young); her queeny hairdresser/best friend Mickey (Robert Michael Morris); and sweet, bubbly new young co-star Juna (Malin Akerman). Kellan Lutz (""Twilight"") appears in one of his first acting jobs.Though Valerie is over-the-top in her quest for fame and constantly over-estimates her own importance, Kudrow gives the character subtle shadings so that you really do care about her, and as a result develop a loathing for the despicable slob writer Paulie G. (Lance Barber) who constantly treats her like a sub-human.Since Kudrow's been in the business long enough to know, I suspect that the line between satire and Hollywood reality became blurred and you have to wonder how much of this actually happens in real life.A fun show that deserved a longer run and enjoyable even for non-Kudrow, non-reality fans.

Now she is back from obscurity in a new sitcom and a reality show. The conflict begins when Valerie comes back to television only to find everything has changed from her glory days when she was on her hit sitcom, ""I'm It!"". Now being treated more like a ""has been"" than a star, she tries to adapt to the new situation which bring results that range from hilarious to heartbreaking at times. Totally unaware to the brutal ""warts and all"" approach to reality TV, Valerie is in for a big surprise when the first episode of her reality show, ""The Comeback"" first airs.

However, those shows were made for the masses. Perhaps HBO was expecting another block buster ratings giant. It sounded like it, when they chose not to renew this show, saying the numbers weren't there and they didn't have any resources to put into promoting it further.However, The Comeback was more of a niche show; subtle, intelligent, willing to embrace pain, humiliation in a point blank fashion. Willing to embrace phases we tend to avoid: those difficult moments in life when somebody says something in which you are not quite sure how to respond, socially awkward situations. A series this intelligent and insightful can only appeal to a few. The great masses prefer simple minded fair to distract them or prefer to see lots of things exploding with lots of pyrotechnics kind of like Homer and Bart Simpson, who are caricatures of ""Everyman"" on the Street"".But as Valerie (Lisa's character says in one episode); Reality TV is becoming ""Coliseum mentality"" and that she doesn't do coliseums. Valerie feared her show would not fare well in such a world. This thought proved to be prophetic.Lisa Kudrow graduated from Vassar College with a degree in Biology. She's an extremely intelligent woman although you might not think so with all the ditzy characters she has played like Phoebe and the Romy and Michelle HS Reunion character.In The Comeback however, as the main character and as Executive Producer, her intelligence is allowed free rein, as she is allowed to fully develop this Valerie character into a lightning rod for all manner of ridiculous situations...she still plays the part of silly and vain woman but does it so well in concert with the whole cast... We get to see humanity and all it's ridiculous foibles: vanity. prententiousness, selfishness, rudeness, vapidness, indifference, ego mania, self involved-ness...Each episode allows us to see in subtle details and not so subtle details the dynamics of human/social interactions.It was definitely not a show for the masses...I don't know if the 2nd season could have been as good as the first but at least we got 13 fantastic episodes of which I have watched at least 15 times each.

I am so surprised that HBO cut the cord so soon on this great show.I think maybe this show was born ahead of It's time by just a year or two. If this show was shown today I think It probably would had been a better hit. The real reality shows of today play out almost exactly to how this parody satires them, no matter what reality show I stumble upon as I surf through the channels, this show pops up in my mind admittedly. This show has so much replay value as I re watched this DVD set more than any of my discs in my whole library. Every cast member is just perfect combined with some genius writing. I love this show!I was never a big Kudrow fan until this show, she brings such life to her character you find yourself believing that there really is a Valarie Cherish. IMO Kudrow's best work is seen here in ""The Comeback""Now for this DVD set by HBO, I have some disappointments, though the picture and sound are just fine. I am not pleased that a play all feature wasn't included.All the episodes are in the full frame format as filmed, don't understand why cause 16 X 9 TV's had been around, so I wish this was widescreen. Extras contain fun and interesting commentaries with Kudrow and creator Michael Patrick King.Two made special for this DVD set Valarie Cherish bits. Valarie in the dressing room of Dancing with the Stars was hysterical, but this just left me wanting more! More of the adventures of Valarie Cherish..curse you HBO!On the last episode's commentary Mr. King talks about a lot of footage filmed for the Comeback that never got seen in the end..I wish that deleted scenes were included on this set maybe on an additional disc, but maybe thats why they weren't..HBO didn't want to put anymore $ into this.If you haven't purchased this set yet I suggest you do it soon.. I have a feeling HBO may knock it out of print soon, if they haven't already.This Is in my list of one of the greatest television shows ever made, just so sad that it was prematurely halted, I have a feeling it would have even got better with the next season.OH heck PLEASE HBO! get everyone back as possible and give the Comeback a comeback!",5,"I wish the Comeback would Comeback, It probably would do even better today.",1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,2209,"['have', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'too', 'short', 'lived', 'masterpiece', 'show', 'am', 'so', 'surprised', 'HBO', 'cut', 'cord', 'so', 'soon', 'great', 'show.I', 'think', 'maybe', 'show', 'was', 'born', 'ahead', 'time', 'just', 'year', 'two', 'show', 'was', 'shown', 'today', 'think', 'probably', 'would', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'hit', 'real', 'reality', 'shows', 'today', 'play', 'out', 'almost', 'exactly', 'how', 'parody', 'matter', 'what', 'reality', 'show', 'stumble', 'surf', 'channels', 'show', 'up', 'mind', 'admittedly', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'replay', 'value', 're', 'watched', 'DVD', 'set', 'more', 'discs', 'whole', 'library', 'cast', 'member', 'just', 'perfect', 'combined', 'genius', 'writing', 'love', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'Kudrow', 'fan', 'show', 'such', 'life', 'character', 'find', 'believing', 'really', 'Valarie', 'Cherish', 'IMO', 'Kudrow', 'best', 'work', 'seen', 'here', 'Comeback', 'Now', 'DVD', 'set', 'HBO', 'have', 'disappointments', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'just', 'fine', 'am', 'not', 'pleased', 'play', 'feature', 'was', ""n't"", 'included.All', 'episodes', 'are', 'full', 'frame', 'format', 'filmed', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'cause', '16', 'X', '9', 'TV', 'had', 'been', 'around', 'wish', 'was', 'widescreen', 'Extras', 'contain', 'fun', 'interesting', 'commentaries', 'Kudrow', 'creator', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'King.Two', 'made', 'special', 'DVD', 'set', 'Valarie', 'Cherish', 'bits', 'Valarie', 'dressing', 'room', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'was', 'hysterical', 'just', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'More', 'adventures', 'Valarie', 'Cherish..curse', 'HBO', 'last', 'episode', 'commentary', 'Mr.', 'King', 'lot', 'footage', 'filmed', 'Comeback', 'never', 'got', 'seen', 'end..I', 'wish', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'included', 'set', 'maybe', 'additional', 'disc', 'maybe', 'thats', 'why', ""weren't..HBO"", 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'put', 'anymore', 'this.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'purchased', 'set', 'yet', 'suggest', 'do', 'soon..', 'have', 'feeling', 'HBO', 'may', 'knock', 'print', 'soon', 'have', ""n't"", 'already.This', 'list', 'one', 'greatest', 'television', 'shows', 'ever', 'made', 'just', 'so', 'sad', 'was', 'prematurely', 'halted', 'have', 'feeling', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'got', 'better', 'next', 'season.OH', 'heck', 'PLEASE', 'HBO', 'get', 'everyone', 'back', 'possible', 'give', 'Comeback', 'comeback']",The Comeback - The Complete Only Season

992698,AOK72ELBI86GF,B000FL7CB4,Poker Face,"[7, 18]","Recently,I was watching ""Ebert and Roeper"", when guest reviewer,Director Kevin Smith(Clerks), highly recommended this series.I decided to give it a try because I like Lisa Kudrow.Though I generally despise reality Tv shows,this is actually just a satire about reality shows so I was pretty sure I would like it anyway.Lisa Kudrow(co-creator of this series and co-writer of the first two episodes) plays Valerie Cherish,a former Tv star,who although is very funny at times,is mostly such a weak and pathetic character [except for one great episode(#8)],that many people won't even get beyond the fourth episode.The first 7 episodes of the ""The Comeback"" spend too much time playing the same one note over and over again.Valerie Cherish is pathetic.Okay,I get it.Though each episode is only about 26 to 30 minutes in length, many scenes go on for too long or are dull to begin with, so that any momentum that the show often develops, disappears quickly.Normally,scenes like this are deleted, but because this involves the filming of a reality show,before it's edited,they are left in so that we can feel like we're actually part of the film crew and we therefore often see too much of the mundane stuff that happens in Valerie's life.Yes,Valerie's timeout thing with the film crew is funny,as are so many other subtle things she does,but she also watches paint dry and does other mind numbing things that tempted me to fast forward the Dvd.As Valerie would say,""I don't need to see that!"" However, I hung in there because I like Kudrow and hoped my pain would eventually subside.No pain,no gain,I kept thinking.I survived the first 7 episodes of this 13 episode series because I like Lisa Kudrow rather than the mostly pathetic,sometimes dense,yet well-meaning Valerie Cherish character.However,I did chuckle and laugh often enough to keep me watching.It's also important to note that the episode (#8) where Valerie Cherish visits Palm Springs and finally leaves the claustrophobic soundstage setting of her Tv sitcom ""Room and Bored"", behind, is an absolute gem!The remaining final five episodes(#9-#13) are similar in tone to the first seven,but seem to have a bit more energy and more interesting plot points to follow(luckily less character development moments),so I feel they are all worthy of a B Grade,instead of the C Grade that the first seven deserve.They were also able to keep me much more interested and were much less painful to watch.DVD EXTRAS:Valerie After the Laughter: Valerie tries to film ""The Comeback"" Dvd Extras but keeps getting interrupted.GRADE: B (Mostly cute,funny,typical Valerie)(8 minutes and 47 seconds long)Valerie Backstage at Dancing with the Stars: No,you DON'T see Valerie dance.Instead she just mostly complains to Mickey,her gay hairdresser, while she's backstage,wearing a green, revealing outfit.GRADE: C (only the last three minutes or so were funny enough to make me chuckle a few times,but because Mickey is always very good with Valerie,I still enjoyed it.) (6 minutes and 12 seconds long)Six Commentaries: For Commentary GRADES,see Episode Notes below for Episodes: #1, #2, #3, #9, #12, #13.Season Index (available on either disc):Brief previews of each of the 13 episodes;each about 36 seconds in length.EPISODE NOTES:Episode #1: While being filmed for her Tv reality series,""The Comeback"",Valerie Cherish gets cast in a Tv sitcom called ""Room and

raunchy dialogue scene @ 13:33-16:15)Watch this episode so you can enjoy Episode #8's last five minutes much more.Episode #8:Valerie and her Husband in Palm Springs-written by Linda Wallem and Michael Patrick King.GRADE: A (Ford Navigator Guy is very funny and the last five minutes are perfect.A real gem!)Watch the entire episode.If you don't like it,you have bad taste,and probably won't enjoy any episodes.Nudity: @ 17:22 Valerie's Husband's rear-end.@ 17:42 topless girl sunbathing.@ 18:55 Valerie's friend,Donna, topless.Episode #9:Valerie hangs out with her step-daughter and cast.GRADE: B

sings @ 25:56; she doesn't hold anything back,so it's funny)Cameo: @ 10:46 James BurrowsAudio COMMENTARY: Lisa Kudrow and Michael Patrick King.GRADE: CEpisode #13: Valerie watches some of her reality show with everyone.GRADE: B+Cameos: @ 4:27 Cameron Diaz (on Tv monitor only-from Tonight Show)@ 23:23 Jay LenoAudio COMMENTARY:by only Michael Patrick King.GRADE: C minusSo,although the first 7 episodes might seem at times like you're watching the same episode over and over again,they still have many funny moments scattered throughout,and I laughed out loud several times.As well, the final

The production is intended to create a fake reality show of a decadent actress. It explores and ridicules the character, focusing on her pathetic and unlucky life. Too bad the scenes are too long, lots of blabbering, poor script, dull story and unintelligent jokes. You have to search for good takes, because this show isn't funny at all.

992700,A170QM825KM60W,B000FL7CB4,rmcrae,"[4, 4]","Having never been a fan of Friends, the only thing I'd seen Lisa Kudrow in was the comedy Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion (which is hilarious). I remember seeing her promote The Comeback on a few talk shows like The View and seeing bits and pieces of the show itself, but I didn't pay too much attention to it. Fast forward to summer 2009. I was cruising through the video store when I came across the dvds for a steal. A friend had just told me how much she enjoyed them and encouraged me to check it out for myself. I took her word for it and I'm so glad I did.Lisa stars as Valerie Cherish (sounds like a porn star's name, huh?), former star of a fictional 90s sitcom called I'm It!, but now a washed up has-been. Looking for a role that will put her back on the A-list, Val is cast on a new sitcom called Room and Bored (it's like a sexualized version of Saved By the Bell with double the cheese). Originally led to believe her role will be that of a wise, sexy architect with plenty of screentime, she ends up playing Aunt Sassy, a frumpy landlord reduced to one short appearance every episode. Poor Val makes due with what she's got while cameras following her for her reality show (you get a cookie if you figured out it's also called The Comeback) capture scenes from her personal and professional life.All of the characters are interesting, funny, and engaging. Val's loving husband Mark, whom she affectionately calls ""Marky Mark"" (Damian Young), is clearly uncomfortable with cameras invading their personal life, but puts up with it for his wife's sake. Her stepdaughter Francesca (Vanessa Marano), a ""too cool for school"" 12 year old obsessed with things like ""ciggys"" and the Atkins diet, pops up from time to time pretending to show interest in Valerie strictly for camera time. Thankfully she has her hairdresser and best friend Mickey (Robert Michael Morris) to lean on during tough times and stare at her awkwardly as she continually embarasses herself. She also (kinda) bonds with her 20 something co-stars. Starlet Juna Millken (Malin kerman) in particular. Executive producer Tom (Robert Bagnell) is kind to Valerie and tries to help her out when she needs it, but fellow producer Paulie G. (Lance Barber) makes it his mission to ignore and humiliate her whenever the opportunity presents itself. It takes her a long time to get the message, but she really gives him his comeuppance in one of the best laugh out loud scenes ever. Rounding out the cast is The Comeback's director Jane (Laura Silverman). She tries to keep her interactions with Val at a minimum with very few on-air appearances, but it's clear that she genuinely cares about her.Lisa Kudrow's performance is brilliant. Valerie is clearly self-absorbed and seriously lacks self-awareness in her quest for a comeback and makes a fool out of herself time and time again, but that also makes her humanity shine through. She's awkward and clumsy, but she's a sweet woman with a good heart underneath it all. Most of the episodes are comedic, but Lisa kills during the dramatic parts that will leave you feeling sorry for her and cheering her on even more. Plus, she has some of the best one liners. As odd as it might sound, it's a good thing HBO cut The Comeback after one season. It would've been interesting to see what direction season 2 would've taken, but the show comes full circle by the end. That's all the Val we need.",5,The Comeback kid,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,3415,"['Having', 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Friends', 'only', 'thing', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'was', 'comedy', 'Romy', 'Michelle', 'High', 'School', 'Reunion', 'hilarious', 'remember', 'seeing', 'promote', 'Comeback', 'few', 'talk', 'shows', 'View', 'seeing', 'bits', 'pieces', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'Fast', 'forward', 'summer', '2009', 'was', 'cruising', 'video', 'store', 'when', 'came', 'dvds', 'steal', 'friend', 'had', 'just', 'told', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'encouraged', 'check', 'out', 'took', 'word', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did.Lisa', 'stars', 'Valerie', 'Cherish', 'porn', 'star', 'name', 'huh', 'former', 'star', 'fictional', '90s', 'sitcom', 'called', ""'m"", 'now', 'washed', 'up', 'has-been', 'Looking', 'role', 'will', 'put', 'back', 'A-list', 'Val', 'cast', 'new', 'sitcom', 'called', 'Room', 'Bored', 'sexualized', 'version', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'double', 'cheese', 'Originally', 'led', 'believe', 'role', 'will', 'be', 'wise', 'sexy', 'architect', 'plenty', 'screentime', 'up', 'playing', 'Aunt', 'Sassy', 'frumpy', 'landlord', 'reduced', 'one', 'short', 'appearance', 'episode', 'Poor', 'Val', 'due', 'what', 'got', 'cameras', 'following', 'reality', 'show', 'get', 'cookie', 'figured', 'out', 'also', 'called', 'Comeback', 'capture', 'scenes', 'personal', 'professional', 'life.All', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'funny', 'engaging', 'Val', 'loving', 'husband', 'Mark', 'whom', 'affectionately', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'Damian', 'Young', 'clearly', 'uncomfortable', 'cameras', 'invading', 'personal', 'life', 'up', 'wife', 'sake', 'stepdaughter', 'Francesca', 'Vanessa', 'Marano', 'too', 'cool', 'school', '12', 'year', 'old', 'obsessed', 'things', 'ciggys', 'Atkins', 'diet', 'time', 'time', 'pretending', 'show', 'interest', 'Valerie', 'strictly', 'camera', 'time', 'Thankfully', 'hairdresser', 'best', 'friend', 'Mickey', 'Robert', 'Michael', 'Morris', 'lean', 'tough', 'times', 'stare', 'awkwardly', 'continually', 'also', 'kinda', 'bonds', '20', 'something', 'co-stars', 'Starlet', 'Juna', 'Millken', 'Malin', 'kerman', 'particular', 'Executive', 'producer', 'Tom', 'Robert', 'Bagnell', 'kind', 'Valerie', 'tries', 'help', 'out', 'when', 'fellow', 'producer', 'Paulie', 'G.', 'Lance', 'Barber', 'mission', 'ignore', 'humiliate', 'whenever', 'opportunity', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'message', 'really', 'comeuppance', 'one', 'best', 'laugh', 'loud', 'scenes', 'ever', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'Comeback', 'director', 'Jane', 'Laura', 'Silverman', 'keep', 'interactions', 'Val', 'minimum', 'very', 'few', 'on-air', 'appearances', 'clear', 'genuinely', 'her.Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'Valerie', 'clearly', 'self-absorbed', 'seriously', 'self-awareness', 'quest', 'comeback', 'fool', 'herself', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'also', 'humanity', 'shine', 'awkward', 'clumsy', 'sweet', 'woman', 'good', 'heart', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', 'comedic', 'Lisa', 'kills', 'dramatic', 'parts', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'cheering', 'even', 'more', 'best', 'one', 'liners', 'As', 'odd', 'might', 'sound', 'good', 'thing', 'HBO', 'cut', 'Comeback', 'one', 'season', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'direction', 'season', '2', 'would', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'show', 'full', 'circle', 'end', 'Val', 'need']",The Comeback - The Complete Only Season

992704,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,B000FL7CB4,Thayer,"[9, 10]","After hearing that Lisa Kudrow would star in a new show about a B-list actress whose trying to make a comeback by starring in her own reality show, I immediately find the series very appealing. And when I finally saw the pilot episode, I really saw a promising series. The series had a rocky start. It premiered to mixed reviews and the ratings were disappointing. Fast forward to the finale and the show, even though the ratings were still weak, is finally receiving wide critical support. And then HBO all of a sudden pulled the plug and abandoned the show. I was really mad when HBO announced that the show won't be renewed for a second season. I really think they've made the wrong decision. They didn't give the series the chance to build an audience especially since the critics are finally behind the show.But at least HBO redeemed themselves (a little bit, I'll never forgive them for what they did to the show) when I learned that they'd be releasing the first and only season of the show on DVD on August 1 this year. And I'm glad that there's a great amount of special features included in the set most notably the commentaries on 6 episodes. Here are the special features:Valerie's DVD InterviewFootage of Valerie backstage at Dancing with the StarsCommentary on 6 Episodes (Pilot, Valerie Triumphs at the Upfronts, Valerie Bonds with the Cast, Valerie Hangs with the Cool Kids, Valerie Stands Out in the Red Carpet, and Valerie Does Another Classic Leno)So here's a rundown of my personal top 5 episodes of the show:(Brief background on the series: Valerie Cherish is a former sitcom star from the show called ""I'm It"" and she's planning to make a comeback by starring in her own reality show while also starring in a new sitcom called Room and Bored.)1. Valerie Relaxes at Palm Springs- a major turning point for the series. A lot of people have been a little annoyed by Valerie being such a pushover and a doormat. When Valerie finally stood for herself, people started to root for the character. Lisa Kudrow gave an Emmy worthy performance in this episode. The drunk scene was priceless. And the ending was perfect.2. Valerie Does Another Classic Leno- the series finale is a bittersweet episode. I'm sad that we would never see these characters develop but I'm glad that the series ended on a high note. This episode is a full circle moment for Valerie as she had her big Leno appearance again. The irony of the episode is that when she finally gave up the sleaziness of reality shows, it turned out that was exactly what she needed to regain her fame. The ending of Valerie being mobbed by fans is a classic moment and perfect way to end the episode and series.3. Valerie Stands Up for Aunt Sassy- another stand out episode as Valerie defended Aunt Sassy (the character she played in the sitcom) from the writers when she found a punchline offensive that might turn off the viewers. This episode was funny and a great character episode for Valerie.4. Valerie Saves the Show- Valerie was not happy with the premiere of her sitcom when her big scene was bombarded by invasive advertisements. A really funny episode.5. (TIE) Valerie Stands Out in the Red Carpet and Valerie Hangs with the Cool Kids- the first was about the whole cast of Room and Bored attending an award show where Valerie had a major fashion faux pas with her dress. The second is about the whole cast planning a boycott of the show and backing out in the last minute without Valerie knowing.There are other great episodes in the series, but those 6 episodes were my favorite. Lisa Kudrow really was award-worthy as Valerie Cherish. She was able to find the balance of comedy and drama in her consistent and well defined characterization. From the first episode to the last episode, the mannerisms she created for the character was intact. She really becomes the character. Kudrow is surrounded by a group of talented supporting actors, most notably Damian Young, as her supportive and protective husband, Lanca Barber as the infamous Paulie G., the pain in the butt whose mission in life is to keep Valerie's life miserable, and lastly Robert Michael Morris as Mickey, Valerie's cheerful makeup artist and her ""favorite gay"", I mean guy.I think this is a welll made, engaging, and entertaining series with some wonderful performances from the cast headed by Lisa Kudrow.

992705,A3CW4EZUTEV0VC,B000FL7CB4,The Rocketman,"[10, 21]","I watched the entire series while on HBO. This DVD set is very expensive for the entertainment you will get.The concept (well documented here already) is that Kudrow's character doesn't get she is B-list at best and slipping even lower fast. Thus, nearly every joke is based on her lack of perception about the real world which we (the viewer) can see via the documentary footage. And that joke is that most people won't put up with an actress who acts like a diva but isn't.That's it. That's the entire series. That's why the ratings weren't that great -- if you saw one episode, you pretty much saw them all. With few exceptions, there were great opportunities for character development which simply never occurred. (One of the rare counter-examples is when Kudrow's character's step-daughter practically steals an episode by showing how she changed her personality with all the cameras around her house filming the ""documentary"".)As a result, the characters become simple one dimensional cut-outs: the fat, grumpy writer, the fey hairstylist/personal assistant, the bubbly up-and-coming starlet, etc. The ending of the season is also rather weak since nearly all of the series is very black in its humor, there is a tack-on feel for a ""feel good ending"". Of course, fans of the series may want to claim this is Kudrow's post-modern attempt at satire on the real Hollywood which always looks for that ending. My mileage varies from that.It's suicide to write a luke-warm review here of something that the die-hard fans will have an emotional reaction to, but it needs to be done. This series was cancelled by HBO even before it was over and the majority of critics didn't care for it either. My rating hopefully will warn people that there is another point of view besides all the 5-star reviews.  This is a mildly amusing, but ultimately mediocre effort, especially compared to other HBO comedies.Finally, the discriminating reader will find that all 5 star reviews here are voted positive unanimously, while anything 3 or less is universally panned -- despite being thoughtful, though less than positive, reviews. That's usually a sign that the 5 star reviews are a set of die-hard extreme fans whom have axes to grind (e.g. upset that the show was cancelled).

Valerie Cherish- one time a-list TV star is making a comeback as a supporting character on another sitcom. At the same time she is doing a reality documentary about her comeback. Some did not find it overtly funny(You have to actually watch it- the jokes don't fly out and hit you in the face) enough, but I have to tell you that I laughed almost to the point of incontinence on several occasions. And I loved Valerie. She always tried to do the right thing, but it was just so hard! Her sidelong glances at the camera documenting and yet, another embarrassing moment were hysterical. Taken from raw (unedited)footage of the documentary, this show captured some great ""unintentional"" moments. I loved every episode. HBO did not give this show enough time to develop, cancelling it after one short season. BAD HBO! Valerie had much more to say and I think the show would have developed into another ""Sex and the City"" if it were given time to flourish. But no for HBO- let's release another ""Sex and the City"" gift set or another season of One Night Stand with mediocre stand up comedy. Release them on DVD or not, I don't care. I have my set and I will treasure them.

I liked the touch of nudity--she didn't. Yes, I felt uncomfortable at times when I saw where the writers were taking the plot, but that's my problem (I'm also a writer).

It was the precursor to many comedies that followed in which there is a conceit of a reality show in the works...Modern Family, The Office, Parks and Recreation.  In some ways, this show is a one trick pony.  You understand the basic premise that the show is about humiliation...as are most comedies in the faux reality format.  What saves this is that Lisa Kudrow does humiliation so well.  It's a shame that it only lasted one season, but it ends very satisfyingly as a self-contained entity.  Interesting statement on the need to control the way one is perceived...even if it's miles away from the truth.",5,You DO need to see that!,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,680,"['Great', 'price', 'complete', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'was', 'precursor', 'many', 'comedies', 'followed', 'conceit', 'reality', 'show', 'works', 'Modern', 'Family', 'Office', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'ways', 'show', 'one', 'trick', 'pony', 'understand', 'basic', 'premise', 'show', 'humiliation', 'are', 'most', 'comedies', 'faux', 'reality', 'format', 'What', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'humiliation', 'so', 'well', 'shame', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'very', 'satisfyingly', 'self-contained', 'entity', 'Interesting', 'statement', 'need', 'control', 'way', 'one', 'perceived', 'even', 'miles', 'away', 'truth']",The Comeback - The Complete Only Season
