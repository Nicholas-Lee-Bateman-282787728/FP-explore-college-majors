Until the advent of Blu-Ray technology, Laserdiscs were the best video format available..Except for shots of his dancing feet, which actually belonged to former Jr. Welterweight champ Mushy Callahan, Errol Flynn did all his boxing stunts in GENTLEMAN JIM. Flynn suffered a mild heart attack during production but after a brief hiatus came back to finish the fight scenes.There's any number of historical errors in Raoul Walsh's biopic of heavyweight champ James J. Corbett. Accepting that it's a fictional account of a real person is easy, for this picture is just so likable. Flynn's Corbett is an ambitious fellow from the wrong sde of the tracks. He's a bank teller who quickly ascends the societal ladder while turning a penchant for familial donnybrooks into a marketable skill: Jim simultaneously becomes a dandy and a pugilist of renown.As depicted here, boxing was illegal in Corbett's San Francisco, yet this didn't stop the organizing of matches which were often raided by the cops. In one scene, Jim and an opponent square off on a moored barge located next to a ship that also appeared inTHE SEA HAWK(1940).As good as Flynn is in the ring, Ward Bond's flamboyant John L. Sullivan is his equal. Their battle for the title is this movie's highlight, a very well-constructed and executed sequence. As boxing films go, this one's up there with the best of them. Flynn's charisma never flags and his fisticuffs always look genuine. GENTLEMAN JIM is a knockout of a sports picture.

Despite devastating good looks and a wickedly easygoing charm, he could hold his own in either a one-on-one fightfight or a barroom brawl. He was, in fact, one of the most feared fighters in Hollywood.&quot;Gentleman Jim,&quot; the story of 19th century boxer James J. Corbett, gave Warner Brothers a chance to put their bad boy on display at his physical best -- exhibiting a lean, mean physique and an undeniable flair for ring work. His toothy grin, devil-may-care charm and boyish glee in a good fight all combined to make &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; one of the 1940s' most compelling films, and one of Warner Brothers' biggest hits.It is interesting to note that during the filming of &quot;Gentleman Jim,&quot; Flynn collapsed and was carted off to the hospital. He was diagnosed, at the ripe old age of 32, of having had a mild heart attack. His co-star in the film, Alexis Smith, visited him and begged him to slow down his destructive lifestyle. Flynn, she later said, flashed that beautiful smile of his and shook his head.&quot;I enjoy this side of life,&quot; he told her, &quot;and don't care to see the other side.&quot;  END",5,Flynn at his two-fisted best,891820800,"04 6, 1998",1998,1180,"['real', 'life', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'was', 'pushover', 'devastating', 'good', 'looks', 'wickedly', 'easygoing', 'charm', 'could', 'hold', 'own', 'one-on-one', 'fightfight', 'barroom', 'brawl', 'was', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'feared', 'fighters', 'Hollywood.', 'quot', 'Gentleman', 'Jim', 'quot', 'story', '19th', 'century', 'boxer', 'James', 'J.', 'Corbett', 'gave', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'chance', 'put', 'bad', 'boy', 'display', 'physical', 'best', 'exhibiting', 'lean', 'mean', 'physique', 'undeniable', 'flair', 'ring', 'work', 'toothy', 'grin', 'devil-may-care', 'charm', 'boyish', 'glee', 'good', 'fight', 'combined', 'make', 'quot', 'Gentleman', 'Jim', 'quot', 'one', '1940s', 'most', 'compelling', 'films', 'one', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'biggest', 'hits.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'filming', 'quot', 'Gentleman', 'Jim', 'quot', 'Flynn', 'collapsed', 'was', 'carted', 'off', 'hospital', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'ripe', 'old', 'age', '32', 'having', 'had', 'mild', 'heart', 'attack', 'co-star', 'film', 'Alexis', 'Smith', 'visited', 'begged', 'slow', 'down', 'destructive', 'lifestyle', 'Flynn', 'later', 'said', 'flashed', 'beautiful', 'smile', 'shook', 'head.', 'quot', 'enjoy', 'side', 'life', 'quot', 'told', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'see', 'other', 'side.', 'quot', 'END']",Gentleman Jim VHS

327884,A2XHRW7XBKEQ31,6302682622,CitizenChampion,"[0, 0]","The Motion Picture ""Gentlemen Jim"" is interesting and enjoyable.""Gentlemen Jim"" is as much about the fight game as it is about John L Sullivan.It is a particular time that Jim Corbett takes center stage.The sport of Pugilism was a time ago illiegal with participants settling there differences with bare knuckles.This was very brutal stuff with legendary fights a matter of record.I put forward that this motion picture was about John L Sullivan,it is that and more.John L Sullivan sometimes called ""The Boston Strong Boy"" was very real,He once traveled the country with a number of other fighters  whereby he fought all comers for a fee. His accomplishment was an outstanding accomplishment of 250 Wins by Knockout with some 400 fights in all with no defeats.These were not official bouts but something of a ""goodwill tour"", many are a matter of record with others merely a historical footnote.John L Sullivan fought such brutal stuff that a particular fight with one Jake  Kilrane lasted some 76 rounds before the fight was broken up.It was scheduled  to go 80 Rounds.Jake Kilrane was so badly mauled that he spent an extended amount of time in a hospital.This is the real story as Pugilism was perhaps nearer a gladiator than some  gentile equivalent.""Gentlemen Jim"" is in part the story of the changing of the guard and the changing of the rules from bare knuckles to Boxing Gloves to 3 minute rounds plus.The film introduces ""The Marques of Queensbury Rules"" which in fact to this very day serve as the governing basis to Professional Prizefighting.John L Sullivan had 35 recorded Professional Prizefights with only 1 loss and that loss this motion picture tells about.Jim Corbett was slightly taller with John L Sullivan possessing a slightly greater reach.The ""Boston Strong Boy"" was as well sometimes known as the ""Honest BackWoodsman"" with Jim Corbett possessing a talent as a performer.He,Jim Corbett starred more than once in one man shows providing for a true compliment to his career in the ring.Jim Corbett was well spoken,and well mannered perhaps why he gained the nick name as ""Gentlemen Jim"".Jim Corbetts boxing career was nowhere near the likes that made for John L Sullivan however Jim Corbett fought one Peter ""Black Prince"" Jackson to a 61 round Draw and it is thought to have been good enough for Sullivan.Jim Corbett once in possession of the crown held onto it for nearly five years when he unexpectedly lost it to Bob Fitzsimmons.The motion picture ""Gentlemen Jim"" stars Ward Bond as John L Sullivan,Jack Carson as Walter Lowrie, Alexis Smith as Victoria Ware, Minor Watson as Buck Ware(Victoria's Wares Father), William Frawley as Billy Delaney  and Alan Hale Sr. portraying Jim Corbetts Father Pat Corbett. Arthur Shields portrayed Father Burke with Dorothy Vaughan as Ma Corbett.  Errol Flynn portrayed Jim Corbett with the Directing of Raoul Walsh being mentioned for good cause.The choice of Errol Flynn for the lead may of been aided by the fact that Flynn was well known for his skills in a boxing ring.He could very ably defend himself. This is a very good and very entertaining film.I might actually suggest with care that this particular motion picture is a sleeper.It was not the likes of a ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" nor ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" nor even ""They Died with There Boots On""it was just on this, one night in the year of 1970 which is when I first viewed ""Gentlemen Jim"". The viewing of this film was like a discovery and so well thought of as a discovery perhaps of entertainment that it is well to mention it.This film it is suggested has everything going for including the flood.It is full of spirit and love and to put it any other way would be foolish.This is great entertainment.I do not have nor is there any reservation in recommending ""Gentlemen Jim"" as first class entertainment.I would recommend to anyone who happens upon this particular review do not short change your viewing of this film as there are scenes that have the capacity to put this motion picture over the top.It is that worth mentioning.",5,"Though its Tough to be a Good Winner,it is a-lot tougher to be a good loser""",1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,4064,"['Motion', 'Picture',

Then it goes from a good film to a great one.Few people could play arrogant men and still come off as a likeable good guy as well as Flynn could and this film is a perfect example of that. Reportedly, this was Flynn's favorite role and I believe that. You can just sense how much fun he was having here. Ward Bond also looks like he was really enjoying his role playing the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond, too, was never better.There is just the right amount of action boxing scenes in here and they are pretty well done, too. Corbett's family is fun to watch, too, as they carry on in the stands during Jim's matches. Out of the arena, Corbett's family's constant arguments and yelling can get a little too loud and annoying but they set the stage for a fitting conclusion.And speaking of the conclusion, Sullivan's speech to Corbett after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film. Some mean-spirited critics (Variety, for example) didn't like that ending nor the fact that much of the film is fictionalized but - duh - most films are fictionalized, like it or not. And, in this case, it made for a nice story and nice ending. (In real life, Corbett was a very soft-spoken true gentleman, not anything like Flynn's portrayal, but Flynn still make him a good guy.)This is one of the more entertaining classic films I have ever watched.",4,Possibly Flynn's Best Role,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,1581,"['Well', 'am', 'delighted', 'hear', 'rumor', 'may', 'finally', 'be', 'issued', 'DVD', '2006', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'most', 'entertaining', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'Gentleman', 'Jim', 'Corbett', 'ring', 'career', 'film', 'Then', 'good', 'film', 'great', 'one.Few', 'people', 'could', 'play', 'arrogant', 'men', 'still', 'come', 'off', 'likeable', 'good', 'guy', 'as', 'well', 'Flynn', 'could', 'film', 'perfect', 'example', 'Reportedly', 'was', 'Flynn', 'favorite', 'role', 'believe', 'can', 'just', 'sense', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'was', 'having', 'here', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'also', 'was', 'really', 'enjoying', 'role', 'playing', 'famous', 'John', 'L.', 'Sullivan', 'Bond', 'too', 'was', 'never', 'better.There', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'action', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'too', 'Corbett', 'family', 'fun', 'watch', 'too', 'carry', 'stands', 'Jim', 'matches', 'arena', 'Corbett', 'family', 'constant', 'arguments', 'yelling', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'too', 'loud', 'annoying', 'set', 'stage', 'fitting', 'conclusion.And', 'speaking', 'conclusion', 'Sullivan', 'speech', 'Corbett', 'big', 'fight', 'very', 'touching', 'highlight', 'film', 'mean-spirited', 'critics', 'Variety', 'example', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'ending', 'fact', 'much', 'film', 'fictionalized', 'duh', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'fictionalized', 'not', 'case', 'made', 'nice', 'story', 'nice', 'ending', 'real', 'life', 'Corbett', 'was', 'very', 'soft-spoken', 'true', 'gentleman', 'not', 'anything', 'Flynn', 'portrayal', 'Flynn', 'still', 'make', 'good', 'guy', 'one', 'more', 'entertaining', 'classic', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'watched']",Gentleman Jim VHS

He's seems very comfortable and at home in this somewhat fictious account of the life of boxer James Corbett.  Flynn is cocky and charming as usual in this story of how Corbett rose from being a bank teller to world champion.  A beautiful and sassy Alexis Smith is along as the love interest, while Alan Hale is his very Irish father, William Frawley his manager, Jack Carson his best buddy, and Ward Bond his biggest rival.  Everyone is very good and appears to be having a great time.  The boxing sequences are well staged by director Raoul Walsh, and generous doses of humour are found throughout.  It teeters on corny at times, but it is all played with such energy and obvious enjoyment, the corny moments can be overlooked.

Truly the father of scientific boxing. It was said when someone saw him in his coffin when he had died, ""He doesn't even have a scar on his face"" That is how good of a boxer he was. He fought great fighters, and done well against them all because of his acquired skill. The movie brings some of this out. His movement and his left jab, keeping his opponenets off balance. He came along at a time when boxing was primarily brawling with the bigger, harder hitting man the victor most of the time. Corbett was most of the time 185 to 195 pounds. A small heavyweight these days. But he consistently beat men heavier than himself. Flynn brings this out in this movie. I don't know how truthful the romance part was in the movie, probably typical hollywood. But a great movie never the less.",5,"Great Movie, probably Earl's best!",1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,895,"['loved', 'movie', 'only', 'regret', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'dvd', 'Great', 'historical', 'movie', 'James', 'J.', 'Corbett', 'Truly', 'father', 'scientific', 'boxing', 'was', 'said', 'when', 'someone', 'saw', 'coffin', 'when', 'had', 'died', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'scar', 'face', 'how', 'good', 'boxer', 'was', 'fought', 'great', 'fighters', 'done', 'well', 'acquired', 'skill', 'movie', 'out', 'movement', 'left', 'jab', 'keeping', 'opponenets', 'off', 'balance', 'came', 'along', 'time', 'when', 'boxing', 'was', 'primarily', 'brawling', 'bigger', 'harder', 'hitting', 'man', 'victor', 'most', 'time', 'Corbett', 'was', 'most', 'time', '185', '195', 'pounds', 'small', 'heavyweight', 'days', 'consistently', 'beat', 'men', 'heavier', 'Flynn', 'out', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'truthful', 'romance', 'part', 'was', 'movie', 'probably', 'typical', 'hollywood', 'great', 'movie', 'never', 'less']",Gentleman Jim VHS
