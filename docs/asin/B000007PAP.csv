494999,A1XI5UAJE5Z6KN,B000007PAP,bordersj2,"[12, 14]","When I think of the early eighties, I immediately remember Colecovision & Atari and Queen, but I also remember some of the movies that were on Cinemax/HBO in the old days of novelty cable TV.  Super Fuzz was definitely one of those movies that bring back memories, along with Flash Gordon & several Chevy Chase comedies (Oh Heavenly Dog, Modern Problems, etc.).  While the movies are pretty campy by today's standards, I still enjoyed them.First off, someone else mentioned it but I feel the need to re-iterate it.  This is Super Snooper.  What horrendous packaging... the cover says ""Super Fuzz"" but the movie is actually Super Snooper.  I was so disappointed after getting this as a birthday present.  Hey, it woulda been a fantastic gift!  But, as sad as this might sound, I remember the music to every scene as if I'd seen it yesterday, and from the very beginning when Terrence is in the swamp, it's pretty clear that this isn't the Super Fuzz version that aired in the USA.  The music comes on at the wrong times and is far too redundant in the European/Canadian version.  But having said all of this, the general movie is the same with the same thing, and it's about a policeman who gets exposed to radiation and uses his super-powers to try to stop a counterfit ring.  Hilarious scenes include him running extremely fast through traffic, roughing up some thugs in a bar, and taking an unexpected trip to China.If you can get the version seen in the USA in the early eighties, I'd actually recommend it.  It might not be a 'masterpiece' to some, but I really enjoyed the movie and it brings back some great memories.",1,NOT the Super Fuzz from the Early 80's US,1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,1623,"['When', 'think', 'early', 'eighties', 'immediately', 'remember', 'Colecovision', 'Atari', 'Queen', 'also', 'remember', 'movies', 'were', 'Cinemax/HBO', 'old', 'days', 'novelty', 'cable', 'TV', 'Super', 'Fuzz', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'movies', 'bring', 'back', 'memories', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'several', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'comedies', 'Oh', 'Heavenly', 'Dog', 'Modern', 'Problems', 'etc.', 'movies', 'are', 'pretty', 'campy', 'today', 'standards', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'off', 'someone', 'else', 'mentioned', 'feel', 'need', 're-iterate', 'Super', 'Snooper', 'What', 'horrendous', 'packaging', 'cover', 'Super', 'Fuzz', 'movie', 'actually', 'Super', 'Snooper', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'getting', 'birthday', 'present', 'Hey', 'woulda', 'been', 'fantastic', 'gift', 'as', 'sad', 'might', 'sound', 'remember', 'music', 'scene', ""'d"", 'seen', 'yesterday', 'very', 'beginning', 'when', 'Terrence', 'swamp', 'pretty', 'clear', ""n't"", 'Super', 'Fuzz', 'version', 'aired', 'USA', 'music', 'wrong', 'times', 'far', 'too', 'redundant', 'European/Canadian', 'version', 'having', 'said', 'general', 'movie', 'same', 'same', 'thing', 'policeman', 'who', 'exposed', 'radiation', 'super-powers', 'try', 'stop', 'counterfit', 'ring', 'Hilarious', 'scenes', 'include', 'running', 'extremely', 'fast', 'traffic', 'roughing', 'up', 'thugs', 'bar', 'taking', 'unexpected', 'trip', 'China.If', 'can', 'get', 'version', 'seen', 'USA', 'early', 'eighties', ""'d"", 'actually', 'recommend', 'might', 'not', 'be', ""'masterpiece"", 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'back', 'great', 'memories']",Super Fuzz VHS

Everyone that enjoys this movie knows it won't win any awards other than make us laugh. The movie although showing it's age, hasn't aged badly. I have seen a number of movies from the same period that were barely watchable because of the dialog and music. This one has aged well. It is still fun to watch. A cop gains superpowers while trying to give a citation in the everglades where all the inhabitants have been evacuated for a rocket test by the government. This test endows officer Dave Speed, played by Terence Hill, with superman like powers. His approach to nabbing the bad guys is more like something out of a Three Stooges short than a police procedures handbook. It helps if you are a fan of Terence Hill and Ernest Borgnine. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch Hill in the ""Trinity"" movies and ""My Name is Nobody"" which is a favorite Western of mine with Henry Fonda and Terence Hill.

495005,A1BJYEMRX782D3,B000007PAP,J. Herman,"[22, 23]","So I finally received my copy today after eagerly waiting for it for several weeks. Having seen it a dozen times on Showtime in 1983, and subsequently purchased the same version of the film on VHS in the '90's, I am pretty familiar with this movie. That said, here's the lowdown on this latest DVD release:* It suffers from PAL speedup, noticeable in the voices and music, despite the fact this is an R1 release* Film is anamorphic widescreen, 1:85:1.* Opening credits feature the title SUPER SNOOPER instead of SUPER FUZZ* There are a few additional scenes featured in the movie, and some extended scenes* The voice of Dave Speed is still Terence Hill's, but it seems like it is a different recorded track compared to the other version (i.e. different line readings in a few instances)* Many, many music cues have been replaced with the standard Super Fuzz musical theme from the opening. Other music cues have disappeared, and several scenes that didn't have music cues at all now have the Super Fuzz theme added. The theme really wears out its welcome in this version, whereas in the other version it was used more sparingly. One horrifying example of music alteration occurs in the scene where Dave busts out of the electric chair, heads underwater and rescues the chief on the bubble gum balloon, the new music and sound cues are awful.* Other voices of some of the supporting characters are completely different, such as those of Tony Torpedo's goons* A few pieces of Hill's voice-over narration appear to be missing or altered* The camera filter used to make the helicopter scene appear to be dusk is gone; scene now appears to be in bright daylightOn the positive side, the quality and clarity of the print looks better than I have ever seen it before.Bottom line: this SUPER SNOOPER version was probably released in England and/or Canada in 1980, and is the cut of the film seen on this DVD. The SUPER FUZZ version that was released theatrically in the US in 1981 is the version we all remember from Showtime and the VHS and earlier DVD release. Clearly, as noted above, there are major differences and thus this DVD will disappoint many fans such as myself who have the previous versions.On a side note, the extras are worthless. There are some production stills included, along with trailers and clips from other Terence Hill movies. No Super Fuzz trailer or director commentaries, contradicting what was stated in the specs on Amazon and other sites.Buy this DVD only if you don't have the VHS or previous DVD release. Despite the improved picture quality, this version has too many differences that distracted me from enjoying it very much. I doubt I will watch this version ever again.Hopefully another studio will put out a quality version of the film that we all love and remember.",1,NOT quite Super Fuzz as you remember it,1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,2797,"['So', 'finally', 'received', 'copy', 'today', 'eagerly', 'waiting', 'several', 'weeks', 'Having', 'seen', 'dozen', 'times', 'Showtime', '1983', 'subsequently', 'purchased', 'same', 'version', 'film', 'VHS', ""'90"", 'am', 'pretty', 'familiar', 'movie', 'said', 'here', 'lowdown', 'latest', 'DVD', 'release', '*', 'PAL', 'speedup', 'noticeable', 'voices', 'music', 'fact', 'R1', 'release*', 'Film', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', '1:85:1', '*', 'Opening', 'credits', 'feature', 'title', 'SUPER', 'SNOOPER', 'instead', 'SUPER', 'FUZZ*', 'are', 'few', 'additional', 'scenes', 'featured', 'movie', 'extended', 'voice', 'Dave', 'Speed', 'still', 'Terence', 'Hill', 'different', 'recorded', 'track', 'compared', 'other', 'version', 'i.e', 'different', 'line', 'readings', 'few', 'instances', '*', 'Many', 'many', 'music', 'cues', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'standard', 'Super', 'Fuzz', 'musical', 'theme', 'opening', 'Other', 'music', 'cues', 'have', 'disappeared', 'several', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'music', 'cues', 'now', 'have', 'Super', 'Fuzz', 'theme', 'added', 'theme', 'really', 'out', 'welcome', 'version', 'whereas', 'other', 'version', 'was', 'used', 'more', 'sparingly', 'One', 'horrifying', 'example', 'music', 'alteration', 'scene', 'where', 'Dave', 'electric', 'chair', 'heads', 'underwater', 'chief', 'bubble', 'gum', 'balloon', 'new', 'music', 'sound', 'cues', 'are', 'awful', '*', 'Other', 'voices', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'such', 'Tony', 'Torpedo', 'goons*', 'A', 'few', 'pieces', 'Hill', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'appear', 'be', 'missing', 'altered*', 'camera', 'filter', 'used', 'make', 'helicopter', 'scene', 'appear', 'be', 'dusk', 'gone', 'scene', 'now', 'be', 'bright', 'daylightOn', 'positive', 'side', 'quality', 'clarity', 'print', 'better', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'before.Bottom', 'line', 'SUPER', 'SNOOPER', 'version', 'was', 'probably', 'released', 'England', 'and/or', 'Canada', '1980', 'cut', 'film', 'seen', 'DVD', 'SUPER', 'FUZZ', 'version', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', 'US', '1981', 'version', 'remember', 'Showtime', 'VHS', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'release', 'Clearly', 'noted', 'are', 'major', 'differences', 'thus', 'DVD', 'will', 'disappoint', 'many', 'fans', 'such', 'myself', 'who', 'have', 'previous', 'versions.On', 'side', 'note', 'extras', 'are', 'worthless', 'are', 'production', 'stills', 'included', 'trailers', 'clips', 'other', 'Terence', 'Hill', 'movies', 'Super', 'Fuzz', 'trailer', 'director', 'commentaries', 'contradicting', 'what', 'was', 'stated', 'specs', 'Amazon', 'other', 'sites.Buy', 'DVD', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'VHS', 'previous', 'DVD', 'release', 'improved', 'picture', 'quality', 'version', 'too', 'many', 'differences', 'distracted', 'enjoying', 'very', 'much', 'doubt', 'will', 'watch', 'version', 'ever', 'again.Hopefully', 'studio', 'will', 'put', 'out', 'quality', 'version', 'film', 'love', 'remember']",Super Fuzz VHS

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[1, 1]","Wow, what a classic!I've probably watched Super Fuzz so many times when I was younger, it's become like what Gone With The Wind is to many people.This brilliant laugh-out-loud comedy stars Terrence Hill as David Speed, a police officer who, after being exposed to ultra-red rays, gains super powers that allow him to move objects, like trucks, with his eyes, fall out high buildings without getting hurt, and make huge balloons from blowing bubble gum. The only kicker is that everytime he sees the color red, he loses his powers temporarily.The movie co-stars Academy Award winning actor Ernest Borgnine (Marty) as David's uptight Sergeant Dunlop.Super Fuzz is a highly enjoyable comedy that everybody will love.RecommendedA-",5,"""Super snooper...super, super snooper!""",1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,726,"['Wow', 'what', 'classic', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'watched', 'Super', 'Fuzz', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'become', 'what', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'many', 'people.This', 'brilliant', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', 'stars', 'Terrence', 'Hill', 'David', 'Speed', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'being', 'exposed', 'ultra-red', 'rays', 'gains', 'super', 'powers', 'allow', 'move', 'objects', 'trucks', 'eyes', 'fall', 'out', 'high', 'buildings', 'getting', 'hurt', 'make', 'huge', 'balloons', 'blowing', 'bubble', 'gum', 'only', 'kicker', 'everytime', 'color', 'red', 'powers', 'temporarily.The', 'movie', 'co-stars', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'actor', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Marty', 'David', 'uptight', 'Sergeant', 'Dunlop.Super', 'Fuzz', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'everybody', 'will', 'love.RecommendedA-']",Super Fuzz VHS

This is NOT the version of this movie I thought I was buying. Someone made a switcheroo and put the European version with terrible music, and so loud you couldn't even hear the dialogue at times. There were also many places where there were no sound effects like the car engine and other regular sounds but only the too loud terrible music from this song and lower, somewhat inaudible dialogue, poorly dubbed.

495020,A33BF8FLZBI59Z,B000007PAP,"T.J. Hooker ""Spider""","[0, 2]","I would like to apologize to Amazon. I complained about this version not being widescreen. I found out that I had to go into ""setup"" on my DVD controller and set it for 4:3 Letterbox. This will fix the problem everyone is having with the DVD playing in Fullscreen format.It is true that this version is the Supersnooper version and not the Super Fuzz version. I have the Super Fuzz version on Fullscreen DVD and there are differences.The plusses for the Supersnopper version: It is widescreen and a clean transfer. This version also has about five minutes of extra footage. The minuses: Some of the music is different in spots and some have said the commentary by Dave Speed is different in spots. I am not sure on that one, but I have only viewed it once so far.The plusses for Super Fuzz version: It is the version I saw first and I am used to every scene and every musical note. The minuses: Fullscreen format makes the picture to cramped. Also the picture quality is not as good.Bottom line: I need to keep both versions to be totally happy. What I want is for someone to release a version with all the scenes in it and leave the music as it was in the Super Fuzz version. Maybe that's not possible, but I can hope.",5,I was wrong!
