730316,A3DLS14W6A35FJ,B00007KK4J,Elizabeth Greene,"[17, 17]","Before tossing this one in the trash, know that there is an easier way to access the extras.  Delightful and funny documentary of a very decent bar band.  Crowe's voice isn't Pavorotti, but it is passable, especially on songs meant to rock.  Not cracked up with his balladeering, but there is an interesting rap type track of a little song called ""Nowhere"".Now to those harder than hell to get to levels.  DVDs like Texas have titles and chapters.  Most DVD player remotes come with a display button.  Hit the display button and navigate the titles starting with 1 then 2 and so forth through 20.  It is a very easy way to get around this DVD without going through all those inane instructions.  I really don't know who's idea the levels were, but they must have been in some sort of dream state.",4,So the Hidden Levels Drive You NUTS...........,1051401600,"04 27, 2003",2003,796,"['tossing', 'one', 'trash', 'know', 'easier', 'way', 'access', 'extras', 'Delightful', 'funny', 'documentary', 'very', 'decent', 'bar', 'band', 'Crowe', 'voice', ""n't"", 'Pavorotti', 'passable', 'especially', 'songs', 'meant', 'rock', 'Not', 'cracked', 'up', 'balladeering', 'interesting', 'rap', 'type', 'track', 'little', 'song', 'called', 'Nowhere', '.Now', 'harder', 'hell', 'get', 'levels', 'DVDs', 'Texas', 'have', 'titles', 'chapters', 'Most', 'DVD', 'player', 'come', 'display', 'button', 'Hit', 'display', 'button', 'navigate', 'titles', 'starting', '1', 'then', '2', 'so', 'forth', '20', 'very', 'easy', 'way', 'get', 'DVD', 'going', 'inane', 'instructions', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'idea', 'levels', 'were', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'sort', 'dream', 'state']",30 Odd Foot of Grunts - Texas

To my surprise, I search it out here on Amazon.com with Fingers X'd, and there it is! I thoroughly enjoyed it, even the the language was rather rough at times. Definitely a great ADD to my growing DVD Concert collection, now up to about 32. 31 are bands/artists and the other is George Carlin.",4,Very Cool Video!,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,478,"['only', 'knew', 'TOFOG', 'several', 'yrs', 'ago', 'when', 'decided', 'search', 'out', 'possible', 'DVD', 'concert', 'performances', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'stretched', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'one', 'made', 'surprise', 'search', 'out', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'Fingers', 'X', ""'d"", 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'language', 'was', 'rather', 'rough', 'times', 'Definitely', 'great', 'ADD', 'growing', 'DVD', 'Concert', 'collection', 'now', '32', '31', 'are', 'bands/artists', 'other', 'George', 'Carlin']",30 Odd Foot of Grunts - Texas
