It was well done and interesting, but not very true to the story.  Although I would not recommend this film, I would not hesitate to order from this vendor again.  The DVD arrived on a timely basis, and was in very good condition.

1354730,A1FG91CM8221X1,B003NE8AXO,Miles D. Moore,"[12, 14]","Jeb Stuart's ""Blood Done Sign My Name,"" based on the book of the same name by Timothy Tyson, is better for the story it tells than for its filmmaking craft. The story--about a racially motivated murder and the resulting civil rights activism in a small North Carolina town circa 1970--is so moving and vital that all Americans should know it. However, Stuart's direction--though solid and competent--is unexciting, and the performances are good but not outstanding. There are so many characters and plotlines that none of the actors or characters has a chance to stand out. In the end, the film seems too diffuse. The photography and music are notable. I would give this film three and a half stars if I could; it's a cut above the mediocrity implied in a three-star rating, but not quite good enough to merit the endorsement implied by four.",3,A decent movie about an important story.,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,842,"['Jeb', 'Stuart', 'Blood', 'Done', 'Sign', 'My', 'Name', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Timothy', 'Tyson', 'better', 'story', 'filmmaking', 'craft', 'story', 'racially', 'motivated', 'murder', 'resulting', 'civil', 'rights', 'activism', 'small', 'North', 'Carolina', 'town', 'circa', '1970', 'so', 'moving', 'vital', 'Americans', 'should', 'know', 'However', 'Stuart', 'direction', 'solid', 'competent', 'unexciting', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'outstanding', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'plotlines', 'none', 'actors', 'characters', 'chance', 'stand', 'out', 'end', 'film', 'too', 'diffuse', 'photography', 'music', 'are', 'notable', 'would', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'could', 'cut', 'mediocrity', 'implied', 'three-star', 'rating', 'not', 'quite', 'good', 'enough', 'merit', 'endorsement', 'implied', 'four']",Blood Done Sign My Name
1354731,ARXYVR1TPTY6P,B003NE8AXO,"TJ-STL ""DVD viewer""","[2, 4]","The story was true and I worked in Biloxi Mississippi during the 1960's. And it was a turbulent time.  The ignorance at that time was wide spread but NOT as total as some would have you believe.  The story should have at least covered the FEAR whites had of ""telling the true"", I was beaten for being a Northerner and for sitting on the wrong ""colored only"" bench at a Greyhound bus depot, I know a degree of fear that has stayed with me. The white minister was not portrayed doing enough to be mentioned in the movie nor was the ""SHAKER"" or whatever he was called.  The story line was something that all should remember by both parties but also they should have a grasp on why ""they won"" besides it being something that MUST be done.  Martin Luther King and Gandhi knew that getting people on your side and using financial pressure on the oppressors created the social pressure to make it work and stick, not using two wrongs to make a right. The actors performance, for what they were given, was very good, but the Author/playwright and director lacked the emotions to get that gut wrenching feeling in the audience to make them willing to give their all to support the movement.  Instead, they chose to portray tarnishing the movement by highlighting the looting and violence.  The movie lacked focus and direction and never had the clear drive to success, and what about the charges for the other two white men?  I had to Google to find out.",2,True horrible story but char never developed in movie,1293235200,"12 25, 2010",2010,1445,"['story', 'was', 'true', 'worked', 'Biloxi', 'Mississippi', '1960', 'was', 'turbulent', 'time', 'ignorance', 'time', 'was', 'wide', 'spread', 'NOT', 'as', 'total', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'covered', 'FEAR', 'whites', 'had', 'telling', 'true', 'was', 'beaten', 'being', 'Northerner', 'sitting', 'wrong', 'colored', 'only', 'bench', 'Greyhound', 'bus', 'depot', 'know', 'degree', 'fear', 'stayed', 'white', 'minister', 'was', 'not', 'portrayed', 'doing', 'enough', 'be', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'was', 'SHAKER', 'was', 'called', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'something', 'should', 'remember', 'parties', 'also', 'should', 'have', 'grasp', 'why', 'won', 'being', 'something', 'MUST', 'be', 'done', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Gandhi', 'knew', 'getting', 'people', 'side', 'using', 'financial', 'pressure', 'oppressors', 'created', 'social', 'pressure', 'make', 'work', 'stick', 'not', 'using', 'two', 'wrongs', 'make', 'right', 'actors', 'performance', 'what', 'were', 'given', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Author/playwright', 'director', 'lacked', 'emotions', 'get', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'feeling', 'audience', 'make', 'willing', 'give', 'support', 'movement', 'Instead', 'chose', 'portray', 'tarnishing', 'movement', 'highlighting', 'looting', 'violence', 'movie', 'lacked', 'focus', 'direction', 'never', 'had', 'clear', 'drive', 'success', 'what', 'charges', 'other', 'two', 'white', 'men', 'had', 'Google', 'find', 'out']",Blood Done Sign My Name
