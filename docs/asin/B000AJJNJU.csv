You should too it is great.It is about a group of designers completely renovating a certain family's house. This is of course reality tv. The catch is the team only has 1 week to make it over. In some cases they rip down the old house and builda new one in its place.

927307,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,B000AJJNJU,J. SHARP,"[8, 11]","In a wasteland of back-stabbing, lying, conniving, and utterly tasteless ""reality"" shows, EMHE stands alone as a positive, compassionate, and (yes) tear-jerking reinforcement of everyone's inner hope that someone cares and will do something - anything - to help.Is it predictable? Oh, goodness yes. Is it sentimental? Interminably. Is it one of the best television shows of the decade? Without a single doubt.Even if it is an hour-long commerical for Disney and Sears, even if the patter and ""instant"" design drawings are phony, and even if Ty's bullhorn stopped being funny after about the second time he used it, this show will always be better than most any other you could watch on a Sunday night. They celebrate ordinary people (not bimbos who want sugar daddies or corporate wannabes with social disorders) with extraordinary hearts (anonymous bone marrow donors and parents who adopt HIV-positive kids) and make a difference in their daily lives.If you can sit through this first season with dry eyes, you may need to check your pulse.My only disappointment with this DVD collection is that it's incomplete. Several episodes are not included (some for legal reasons). Especially unfortunate is the absence of the aforementioned story of the bone marrow donor (one of the sweetest and cutest ladies in the world) who saved the life of a baby girl. This was the story that made me a permanent viewer and I'll admit I cried buckets when she finally met the child's mother.The legal cases touch on my only hesitation in enjoying the show: Follow-up seems to be rare and running a 5,000 square foot home on a blue collar budget seems a recipe for disaster. ABC seems to be addressing that more often but it's still an area of concern.All in all, though, I love this program.",4,They finally moved the bus!,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,1776,"['wasteland', 'back-stabbing', 'lying', 'conniving', 'utterly', 'tasteless', 'reality', 'shows', 'EMHE', 'alone', 'positive', 'compassionate', 'yes', 'tear-jerking', 'reinforcement', 'everyone', 'inner', 'hope', 'someone', 'cares', 'will', 'do', 'something', 'anything', 'help.Is', 'predictable', 'Oh', 'goodness', 'yes', 'sentimental', 'Interminably', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'shows', 'decade', 'single', 'doubt.Even', 'hour-long', 'commerical', 'Disney', 'Sears', 'even', 'patter', 'instant', 'design', 'drawings', 'are', 'phony', 'even', 'Ty', 'bullhorn', 'stopped', 'being', 'funny', 'second', 'time', 'used', 'show', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'could', 'watch', 'Sunday', 'night', 'celebrate', 'ordinary', 'people', 'not', 'bimbos', 'who', 'want', 'sugar', 'daddies', 'corporate', 'wannabes', 'social', 'disorders', 'extraordinary', 'hearts', 'anonymous', 'bone', 'marrow', 'donors', 'parents', 'who', 'adopt', 'HIV-positive', 'kids', 'make', 'difference', 'daily', 'can', 'sit', 'first', 'season', 'dry', 'eyes', 'may', 'need', 'check', 'pulse.My', 'only', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'collection', 'incomplete', 'Several', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'legal', 'reasons', 'Especially', 'unfortunate', 'absence', 'aforementioned', 'story', 'bone', 'marrow', 'donor', 'one', 'sweetest', 'cutest', 'ladies', 'world', 'who', 'saved', 'life', 'baby', 'girl', 'was', 'story', 'made', 'permanent', 'viewer', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'cried', 'buckets', 'when', 'finally', 'met', 'child', 'mother.The', 'legal', 'cases', 'touch', 'only', 'hesitation', 'enjoying', 'show', 'Follow-up', 'be', 'rare', 'running', '5,000', 'square', 'foot', 'home', 'blue', 'collar', 'budget', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'ABC', 'be', 'addressing', 'more', 'often', 'still', 'area', 'concern.All', 'love', 'program']",N/A
927308,AIFNOZKR9WTYI,B000AJJNJU,"mark twain ""25354""","[5, 49]","Last night I tried to watch an episode of this program, featuring a black family who live in a house that is infested with mold.  Their idea of doing something about their problem is to try to get Extreme Makeover to do something about it.  Beyond that, self-agency does not seem to have occurred to them.  The crew of Extreme Makeover, an assortment of LA hipster types, most of whom seem to serve no useful purpose either in the show or in life in general, visits the family in the hotel room they are currently using as a refuge from their mold-infested house.  Again, this shows unclear thinking.  Hotel rooms are quite expensive.  Clearly it would be more economically feasible to simply rent an apartment.  It is not as if the mold problem sprang up over night.  Also, the water leak that is causing the mold problem has gone unrepaired all this time.  The mold growth has gone untreated.  The family seems to make irrational decisions as a modus vivendi.  So EM ""surprises"" them, on-camera, in their hotel.  The whole family runs screaming hysterically into the hallway as if the room were on fire.  One of the EM ""team"" describes this exodus as ""an explosion of love.""  Well, in the first place, I believe avarice is the correct word.  In the second place, there seemed to be more undignified group excitement than love.  One can easily imagine these people looting during a riot.  At any event, dignity is not the strong suit of these people.  They seem to have no problem soliciting what is ostensibly charity and then publicly exulting in their ""good fortune,"" including screaming about their new house while on vacation at Disney World.  The message of the show is that self-effort is only worthwhile if it is spent trying to enlist opulent charity from TV shows, on which you will be parading your shambolic condition to the entire country, then hysterically wallowing in your new house, which you clearly do not deserve, since you have done nothing to better your own condition.  If Rocky were an episode of EM, Rocky's ""training"" would consist of writing letters to ABC in the hopes that the EM ""crew"" would descend on him, waylay Appollo Creeed in an alley and break his legss, crown Rocky champ for no good reason while he is hysterically sceaming over his ""achievement"" and then unveil a dream gym that Ty Pennington has ""secretly"" been ""working"" on.  Apparently the new American dream is to get something for nothing by abandoning all human dignity.  Good stuff!P.S. The show also makes much of the non-achievements of the family in question.  The family members are portrayed as highly accomplished, though this is clearly inaccurate.  For example one teenage son is described as ""A great athlete.""  The justification for this is that he likes to drive a go-cart.  No, I'm not making this up.",2,liberal insanity,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,2812,"['Last', 'night', 'tried', 'watch', 'episode', 'program', 'featuring', 'black', 'family', 'who', 'live', 'house', 'infested', 'mold', 'idea', 'doing', 'something', 'problem', 'try', 'get', 'Extreme', 'Makeover', 'do', 'something', 'self-agency', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'occurred', 'crew', 'Extreme', 'Makeover', 'assortment', 'LA', 'hipster', 'types', 'most', 'whom', 'seem', 'serve', 'useful', 'purpose', 'show', 'life', 'general', 'family', 'hotel', 'room', 'are', 'currently', 'using', 'refuge', 'mold-infested', 'house', 'Again', 'unclear', 'thinking', 'Hotel', 'rooms', 'are', 'quite', 'expensive', 'Clearly', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'economically', 'feasible', 'simply', 'rent', 'apartment', 'not', 'mold', 'problem', 'sprang', 'up', 'night', 'Also', 'water', 'leak', 'causing', 'mold', 'problem', 'gone', 'unrepaired', 'time', 'mold', 'growth', 'gone', 'untreated', 'family', 'make', 'irrational', 'decisions', 'modus', 'vivendi', 'So', 'EM', 'surprises', 'on-camera', 'hotel', 'whole', 'family', 'screaming', 'hysterically', 'hallway', 'room', 'were', 'fire', 'One', 'EM', 'team', 'exodus', 'explosion', 'love', 'Well', 'first', 'place', 'believe', 'avarice', 'correct', 'word', 'second', 'place', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'undignified', 'group', 'excitement', 'love', 'One', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'people', 'looting', 'riot', 'event', 'dignity', 'not', 'strong', 'suit', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'problem', 'soliciting', 'what', 'ostensibly', 'charity', 'then', 'publicly', 'exulting', 'good', 'fortune', 'including', 'screaming', 'new', 'house', 'vacation', 'Disney', 'World', 'message', 'show', 'self-effort', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'spent', 'trying', 'enlist', 'opulent', 'charity', 'TV', 'shows', 'will', 'be', 'parading', 'shambolic', 'condition', 'entire', 'country', 'then', 'hysterically', 'wallowing', 'new', 'house', 'clearly', 'do', 'not', 'deserve', 'have', 'done', 'nothing', 'better', 'own', 'condition', 'Rocky', 'were', 'episode', 'EM', 'Rocky', 'training', 'would', 'consist', 'writing', 'letters', 'ABC', 'hopes', 'EM', 'crew', 'would', 'descend', 'waylay', 'Appollo', 'Creeed', 'alley', 'break', 'legss', 'crown', 'Rocky', 'champ', 'good', 'reason', 'hysterically', 'sceaming', 'achievement', 'then', 'unveil', 'dream', 'gym', 'Ty', 'Pennington', 'secretly', 'been', 'working', 'Apparently', 'new', 'American', 'dream', 'get', 'something', 'nothing', 'abandoning', 'human', 'dignity', 'Good', 'stuff', 'P.S', 'show', 'also', 'much', 'non-achievements', 'family', 'question', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'portrayed', 'highly', 'accomplished', 'clearly', 'inaccurate', 'example', 'one', 'teenage', 'son', 'described', 'A', 'great', 'athlete', 'justification', 'drive', 'go-cart', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'making', 'up']",N/A
