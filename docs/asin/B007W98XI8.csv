Mary-Louise Parker and the others brought Weeds from the 1960s to the 2012s.  Weeds shows what can happen when you live a life working in the Mary Jane world.  They take you on a wild ride from a small town to Mexico, New york, etc.  It has an ending leaving a feeling that was the whole gig worth it? Lot of smoking and sex with a lot of laughs.
