His father (Amrik Singh) says that if he finds truth then return and tell him. And if he should find nothing to return any way; as like the river everything returns.His path through the story, that takes place in no certain time or place, sort of parallels the Buddha's searching's but is not a fictionalized version. His friend finally chooses another path leaving Siddhartha to find his way alone. Siddhartha decides that enlightenment comes from within and can not be taught. The Buddha admonishes Siddhartha not to be too clever.His searching takes him through several lives as he learns of love and money, and a few more experiences. He almost seems like snot as he explains to a courtesan that he doesn't really love. Recognizing that he has wasted his time with searching he comes to some interesting conclusions.In this 1972 film by Conrad Rooks captures more of the original book than he intended. The film was not intended to be more than an adoption of the book as the director figured that his 25 years in India gave him a better insight than Hermann Hesse's (the book that the movie was based on) 11 month insight.One of the profound items I picked up on was the speech about what a rock could be.",4,Like the river everything returns,1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,1345,"['Siddhartha', 'Brahmin', 'son', 'friend', 'fathers', 'house', 'search', 'different', 'life', 'sedate', 'environment', 'home', 'father', 'Amrik', 'Singh', 'truth', 'then', 'return', 'tell', 'should', 'find', 'nothing', 'return', 'way', 'river', 'everything', 'returns.His', 'path', 'story', 'place', 'certain', 'time', 'place', 'sort', 'parallels', 'Buddha', 'searching', 'not', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'friend', 'finally', 'path', 'leaving', 'Siddhartha', 'find', 'way', 'alone', 'Siddhartha', 'enlightenment', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'taught', 'Buddha', 'admonishes', 'Siddhartha', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'clever.His', 'searching', 'several', 'lives', 'love', 'money', 'few', 'more', 'experiences', 'almost', 'like', 'snot', 'courtesan', ""n't"", 'really', 'love', 'Recognizing', 'wasted', 'time', 'searching', 'interesting', 'conclusions.In', '1972', 'film', 'Conrad', 'Rooks', 'more', 'original', 'book', 'intended', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'more', 'adoption', 'book', 'director', 'figured', '25', 'years', 'India', 'gave', 'better', 'insight', 'Hermann', 'Hesse', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'based', '11', 'month', 'insight.One', 'profound', 'items', 'picked', 'up', 'was', 'speech', 'what', 'rock', 'could', 'be']",Siddhartha

724024,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0000714B5,C. B Collins Jr.,"[7, 9]","I have loved Hermann Hesse's novel Siddhartha for many years, having first read it in psychology graduate school in 1974 and then 10 years later. But all those who know and love Hesse's wonderful novel Siddhartha know that it is primarily a novel about the quest for inner enlightenment. Even though we follow the main character SIddhartha through the struggles with his father, his years of meditation in the forrest as a Sadhu, his dialogue with the Buddha, his years of love-making with Kamala, and finally his work and meditation as a river ferryman; yet the novel is centered around the spiritual growth and inner direction of the main character.The plot is secondary to the inner growth of the main character. In fact, it has less plot than almost any novel since the tensions are not between characters and situations but primarily between Siddhartha and himself in his quest for truth.Thus, this is not an easy novel to turn into a film. How do you show the quest for inner enlightenment? How do you keep the interest of the viewing audience when the plot-line is minimal?The writers, directors, and cinematographers for this film relied on minimal dialogue and beautiful cinematography of Northern India's bridges, castles, villages, forrests, and rivers.Unfortunately this was not enough. The actors appear to have never read the actual novel and thus both actors that portray Siddhartha and Kamala seem wooden, stiff, and over-stated rather than realistic.The relationship between Siddhartha and his father was not fully developed. The relationship of Siddhartha and Kamala was a primary focus and anchor of the film and yet the actors handled it like day-time-TV soap-opera melodrama.Scenes with the historic Buddha were some of the better parts of the film in that the filmakers had the Buddha voice-over essential clear summaries of Buddhism without ever seeing the face of the Buddha.However, overall subtlety of emotion and thought is lost and thus the film is really a disappointment to those who know the novel well.",2,This film does not reach the high standards of the novel,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,2034,"['have', 'loved', 'Hermann', 'Hesse', 'novel', 'Siddhartha', 'many', 'years', 'having', 'first', 'read', 'psychology', 'graduate', 'school', '1974', 'then', '10', 'years', 'later', 'who', 'know', 'love', 'Hesse', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'Siddhartha', 'know', 'primarily', 'novel', 'quest', 'inner', 'enlightenment', 'Even', 'follow', 'main', 'character', 'SIddhartha', 'struggles', 'father', 'years', 'meditation', 'forrest', 'Sadhu', 'dialogue', 'Buddha', 'years', 'love-making', 'Kamala', 'finally', 'work', 'meditation', 'river', 'ferryman', 'novel', 'centered', 'spiritual', 'growth', 'inner', 'direction', 'main', 'character.The', 'plot', 'secondary', 'inner', 'growth', 'main', 'character', 'fact', 'less', 'plot', 'almost', 'novel', 'tensions', 'are', 'not', 'characters', 'situations', 'primarily', 'Siddhartha', 'quest', 'truth.Thus', 'not', 'easy', 'novel', 'turn', 'film', 'How', 'do', 'show', 'quest', 'inner', 'enlightenment', 'How', 'do', 'keep', 'interest', 'viewing', 'audience', 'when', 'plot-line', 'minimal', 'writers', 'directors', 'cinematographers', 'film', 'relied', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Northern', 'India', 'bridges', 'castles', 'villages', 'forrests', 'rivers.Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'actors', 'appear', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'actual', 'novel', 'thus', 'actors', 'portray', 'Siddhartha', 'Kamala', 'seem', 'wooden', 'stiff', 'over-stated', 'rather', 'realistic.The', 'relationship', 'Siddhartha', 'father', 'was', 'not', 'fully', 'developed', 'relationship', 'Siddhartha', 'Kamala', 'was', 'primary', 'focus', 'anchor', 'film', 'yet', 'actors', 'handled', 'day-time-TV', 'soap-opera', 'melodrama.Scenes', 'historic', 'Buddha', 'were', 'better', 'parts', 'film', 'filmakers', 'had', 'Buddha', 'voice-over', 'essential', 'clear', 'summaries', 'Buddhism', 'ever', 'seeing', 'face', 'Buddha.However', 'overall', 'subtlety', 'emotion', 'thought', 'lost', 'thus', 'film', 'really', 'disappointment', 'who', 'know', 'novel', 'well']",Siddhartha
724025,A1K9KNLTSJF7Q9,B0000714B5,Daiho,"[10, 10]","Director Conrad Rooks was something of a sensation in the 1970's, the son of the Avon cosmetics empire and an alcoholic by the age of 15, he also spent a number of years in India and taught himself film-making.  Besides his autobiographical 1966 movie, Chappaqua, his adaptation of Herman Hesse's Siddhartha was his one and only cinematic achievement. Today he is largely forgotten.  As of this writing he doesn't even have an entry in Wikipedia.But Siddhartha lives on as a literary classic and as a result the film is still sought out by loyal and often fanatical fans of the book.  A quarter century later it is still a visually beautiful film, one that can impress, especially on a large screen, with its panoramic shots.  Brooks knew India and his familiarity with the place shines through in the film.The acting is not bad, but on occasion overdone, such as the boatman's homilies delivered in a patronizingly saccharine voice.  The script is occasionally clunky, lifting bits straight from the book, and in parts the story seems a bit rushed.  The middle section - in which Siddhartha meets Kamala, moves to town, and becomes a local businessman - has the most natural and unhurried flow.  Two decades on the sex scenes are not unsurprisingly tame - and occasionally comical (such as Siddhartha's first orgasm).The biggest problem with the film is that it leaves out what is for me one of the most meaningful observations of Siddhartha's life, that his time as a husband and father, as a property owner and businessman, was not wasted time.  On the contrary, he could not have arrived at enlightenment without having experienced a life of sensual pleasure - and despair.  As Siddhartha tells his friend Govinda many years later:""I learned through my body and soul that it was necessary for me to sin, that I needed lust, that I had to strive for property and experience nausea and the depths of despair in order to learn not to resist them, in order to learn to love the world, and no longer compare it with some kind of desired imaginary world, some imaginary vision of perfection, but to leave it as it is, to love it and be glad to belong to it.""#",3,Lovely cinematography doesn't save a poor adaptation,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,2157,"['Director', 'Conrad', 'Rooks', 'was', 'something', 'sensation', '1970', 'son', 'Avon', 'cosmetics', 'empire', 'alcoholic', 'age', '15', 'also', 'spent', 'number', 'years', 'India', 'taught', 'film-making', 'autobiographical', '1966', 'movie', 'Chappaqua', 'adaptation', 'Herman', 'Hesse', 'Siddhartha', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'Today', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'writing', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'entry', 'Wikipedia.But', 'Siddhartha', 'literary', 'classic', 'result', 'film', 'still', 'sought', 'out', 'loyal', 'often', 'fanatical', 'fans', 'book', 'quarter', 'century', 'later', 'still', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'impress', 'especially', 'large', 'screen', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'Brooks', 'knew', 'India', 'familiarity', 'place', 'shines', 'film.The', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'occasion', 'overdone', 'such', 'boatman', 'homilies', 'delivered', 'patronizingly', 'saccharine', 'voice', 'script', 'occasionally', 'clunky', 'lifting', 'bits', 'straight', 'book', 'parts', 'story', 'bit', 'rushed', 'middle', 'section', 'Siddhartha', 'Kamala', 'town', 'local', 'businessman', 'most', 'natural', 'unhurried', 'flow', 'Two', 'decades', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'unsurprisingly', 'tame', 'occasionally', 'comical', 'such', 'Siddhartha', 'first', 'orgasm', '.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'out', 'what', 'one', 'most', 'meaningful', 'observations', 'Siddhartha', 'life', 'time', 'husband', 'father', 'property', 'owner', 'businessman', 'was', 'not', 'wasted', 'time', 'contrary', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'arrived', 'enlightenment', 'having', 'experienced', 'life', 'sensual', 'pleasure', 'despair', 'Siddhartha', 'friend', 'Govinda', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'learned', 'body', 'soul', 'was', 'necessary', 'sin', 'needed', 'lust', 'had', 'strive', 'property', 'experience', 'nausea', 'depths', 'despair', 'order', 'learn', 'not', 'resist', 'order', 'learn', 'love', 'world', 'no', 'longer', 'compare', 'kind', 'desired', 'imaginary', 'world', 'imaginary', 'vision', 'perfection', 'leave', 'love', 'be', 'glad', 'belong']",Siddhartha
724026,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0000714B5,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 3]","No movie that is even marginally true to the story that Nobel Prize-winning German author Hermann Hesse told in his novel Siddhartha (1951) is without merit; and this modest film is no exception.  The problem is, that while Conrad Brooks, who wrote, directed and produced the film, is true to the storyline of the novel and even in some respects true to the spirit of the novel, he fails to bring the power and the resplendence of Hesse's philosophic and spiritual masterpiece to the screen.What made the novel one of the best ever written is the character of Siddhartha himself.  Patterned after the Buddha both in temperament and in experience, Hesse's Siddhartha, ""the Accomplished One,"" grew up amid extravagant wealth and privilege only to dump it all in an effort to find himself.  Brooks fails almost immediately when he leaves out the scene from the book in which the young Siddhartha, not wanting to directly disobey his father (and to demonstrate his resolve) stands up all night waiting patiently for his father's permission to leave their splendid estates.  This is one of the great ""coming of age"" scenes ever written and an early insight into Siddhartha's strength of character, but Brooks gives it barely a notice!Also skirted over too quickly are Siddhartha's years with the samanas in the forest where he practiced meditation and austerities.  This part of Siddhartha's life was essential in making him the man he was and in showing us his character.  He spent six years with the shamans and gurus of the forest (along with his companion Govinda) and in the end learned everything they knew and more, and yet had not found the answer he sought. (This parallels the experience of the ""emaciated"" Buddha.)Brooks does do the meeting with the Buddha well, having us hear his voice but not see him, and then follows that up with Siddhartha's reasons for not following the Buddha, even though he finds no fault with the Enlightened One's teachings.  Note that without his actually meeting the Buddha, the life of Siddhartha (which is one of the traditional names of the Buddha) would so closely parallel that of the Buddha that some people might think that Hesse had written a profane life of the Buddha, which might not set well with some Buddhists!  (Of course we all have the Buddha nature.)Siddhartha's life with the courtesan Kamala and the merchant Kamaswami and his spiral into debauchery and sloth is well depicted, although again the ultimate disillusionment that Siddhartha experienced is not as well presented as in the novel.  Which brings me to Shashi Kapoor who plays Siddhartha.  Although he would go on to be the veteran of well over a hundred films, and although he is appropriately enough Indian as well as tall, dark and handsome and a good actor, he fails to evoke the passion that Siddhartha must have.  Siddhartha felt everything in a profound manner, even boredom was profoundly experienced by the Brahmin's prodigal son.  Kapoor, especially near the end of the film when he plays an old man, occasionally made me feel that he could be ""the Accomplished One,"" but more often he made me feel that he was holding something back.Finally, the poetic scene near the end of the novel when, after living with and being guided by Vasudeva, the ferryman, Siddhartha becomes one with the river and falls spiritually into its wisdom, is only a bland shadow of what appears in the novel!Part of the reason for the failure probably has to do with a limited budget.  The film is 83 minutes long, but could easily be twice that long.  Part has to do with the selection of scenes and the emphasis on those scenes, and finally part of the reason has to do with the relative inexperience of Brooks who was only directing his second major film (and apparently his last).  Certainly the on-location in India cinematography by Sven Nykvist who worked on so many films with Ingmar Berman is not to be faulted.  Although not spectacular, Nykvist's camera conveys both the exotic beauty and the poverty of a landscape that could have been India 26 centuries ago.",3,"Not bad, but fails to capture the resplendence of the novel",1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,4072,"['movie', 'even', 'marginally', 'true', 'story', 'Nobel', 'Prize-winning', 'German', 'author', 'Hermann', 'Hesse', 'told', 'novel', 'Siddhartha', '1951', 'merit', 'modest', 'film', 'exception', 'problem', 'Conrad', 'Brooks', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'produced', 'film', 'true', 'storyline', 'novel', 'even', 'respects', 'true', 'spirit', 'novel', 'bring', 'power', 'resplendence', 'Hesse', 'philosophic', 'spiritual', 'masterpiece', 'screen.What', 'made', 'novel', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'written', 'character', 'Siddhartha', 'Patterned', 'Buddha', 'temperament', 'experience', 'Hesse', 'Siddhartha', 'Accomplished', 'One', 'grew', 'up', 'extravagant', 'wealth', 'privilege', 'only', 'dump', 'effort', 'find', 'Brooks', 'almost', 'immediately', 'when', 'out', 'scene', 'book', 'young', 'Siddhartha', 'not', 'wanting', 'directly', 'disobey', 'father', 'demonstrate', 'resolve', 'up', 'night', 'waiting', 'patiently', 'father', 'permission', 'leave', 'splendid', 'one', 'great', 'coming', 'age', 'scenes', 'ever', 'written', 'early', 'insight', 'Siddhartha', 'strength', 'character', 'Brooks', 'barely', 'notice', 'Also', 'skirted', 'too', 'quickly', 'are', 'Siddhartha', 'years', 'samanas', 'forest', 'where', 'practiced', 'meditation', 'austerities', 'part', 'Siddhartha', 'life', 'was', 'essential', 'making', 'man', 'was', 'showing', 'character', 'spent', 'six', 'years', 'shamans', 'gurus', 'forest', 'companion', 'Govinda', 'end', 'learned', 'everything', 'knew', 'more', 'yet', 'had', 'not', 'found', 'answer', 'sought', 'experience', 'emaciated', 'Buddha', 'Brooks', 'do', 'meeting', 'Buddha', 'well', 'having', 'hear', 'voice', 'not', 'see', 'then', 'up', 'Siddhartha', 'reasons', 'not', 'following', 'Buddha', 'even', 'fault', 'Enlightened', 'One', 'teachings', 'Note', 'actually', 'meeting', 'Buddha', 'life', 'Siddhartha', 'one', 'traditional', 'names', 'Buddha', 'would', 'so', 'closely', 'parallel', 'Buddha', 'people', 'might', 'think', 'Hesse', 'had', 'written', 'profane', 'life', 'Buddha', 'might', 'not', 'set', 'well', 'Buddhists', 'course', 'have', 'Buddha', 'nature', 'Siddhartha', 'life', 'courtesan', 'Kamala', 'merchant', 'Kamaswami', 'spiral', 'debauchery', 'sloth', 'well', 'depicted', 'again', 'ultimate', 'disillusionment', 'Siddhartha', 'experienced', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'presented', 'novel', 'Which', 'Shashi', 'Kapoor', 'who', 'Siddhartha', 'would', 'go', 'be', 'veteran', 'well', 'hundred', 'films', 'appropriately', 'enough', 'Indian', 'as', 'well', 'tall', 'dark', 'handsome', 'good', 'actor', 'evoke', 'passion', 'Siddhartha', 'must', 'have', 'Siddhartha', 'felt', 'everything', 'profound', 'manner', 'even', 'boredom', 'was', 'profoundly', 'experienced', 'Brahmin', 'prodigal', 'son', 'Kapoor', 'especially', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'old', 'man', 'occasionally', 'made', 'feel', 'could', 'be', 'Accomplished', 'One', 'more', 'often', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'holding', 'something', 'back.Finally', 'poetic', 'scene', 'end', 'novel', 'when', 'living', 'being', 'guided', 'Vasudeva', 'ferryman', 'Siddhartha', 'one', 'river', 'spiritually', 'wisdom', 'only', 'bland', 'shadow', 'what', 'novel', 'Part', 'reason', 'failure', 'probably', 'do', 'limited', 'budget', 'film', '83', 'minutes', 'long', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'twice', 'long', 'Part', 'do', 'selection', 'scenes', 'emphasis', 'scenes', 'finally', 'part', 'reason', 'do', 'relative', 'inexperience', 'Brooks', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'directing', 'second', 'major', 'film', 'apparently', 'last', 'Certainly', 'on-location', 'India', 'cinematography', 'Sven', 'Nykvist', 'who', 'worked', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'Ingmar', 'Berman', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'not', 'spectacular', 'Nykvist', 'camera', 'exotic', 'beauty', 'poverty', 'landscape', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'India', '26', 'centuries', 'ago']",Siddhartha

I see little point in regurgitating the essence of the plot as it really does nothing but detract from the purpose of the review.As with all works of art, in whatever media form it may be expressed, this is an interpretive statement of the author's original novel and as such it is an interpretation as much based on the audience it is geared up to as well as the film maker's. It may be legitimate for a critic to dispute the finer points of the interpretation or even  the philosophical or religious underpinnings but in this case, it seems to me that we miss the point.As a reader, I must confess to finding all of Hesse's work not as it would appear at first glance. Even Siddhartha, an apparently simple tale, is a much more complex and thought provoking text than it appears. Not being an expert in this area, I do not dare to present an exegis of the book which I will happily leave to more authoritative reviewers.To me the director has tried to tease out, as he sees them, the salient points of the text and has done so in a personal form as if the main character is the narrator. He tells the tale in a rather unfeeling way suggesting a sense of detatchment and objectivity, a device which is present throughout the movie and which in a way denies the need to try and deal with an emotional aspect. Siddhartha's inability to deny his emotions is sorely tested when his newly found son rejects him and runs away to the town. Further, his innate inability to recognise these passions and deal with them brings into sharp focus the imbalance in his character of being too objective, too clever, too logical. In a way the film seems to be taking more of a Zen approach throughout.There is abundant beauty throughtout this film. Not surprisingly the three central characters are very photogenic and beautiful and their surroundings are clear and beautiful too. The exposure of poverty and opulence to the camera gives everything an appearance of beauty including the poor and the holy men. This again allows the highlighting of the bad as feelings and inhumanity such as the travellers pushing away the young boy as he searches urgently for help for his mother.There is beauty too in the overall serenity of the movie which perhaps may have been an aim of the director.Ultimately, this movie can be interpreted too on many levels and in that it certainly follows the book. I found it to be engrossing and thought provoking and my only negative is the excessive echo on the voices.This is a must for anyone who wishes to take an introduction into Hesse's work before delving into the text. It is worth watching too as a sumptuous spectacle of filmmaking.",4,"Flow, river, flow",1127865600,"09 28, 2005",2005,2803,"['beautiful', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'probably', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'way', 'director', 'interpreted', 'Herman', 'Hesse', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'see', 'little', 'point', 'regurgitating', 'essence', 'plot', 'really', 'nothing', 'detract', 'purpose', 'review.As', 'works', 'art', 'media', 'form', 'may', 'be', 'expressed', 'interpretive', 'statement', 'author', 'original', 'novel', 'such', 'interpretation', 'much', 'based', 'audience', 'geared', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'maker', 'may', 'be', 'legitimate', 'critic', 'dispute', 'finer', 'points', 'interpretation', 'even', 'philosophical', 'religious', 'underpinnings', 'case', 'miss', 'point.As', 'reader', 'must', 'confess', 'finding', 'Hesse', 'work', 'not', 'would', 'appear', 'first', 'glance', 'Even', 'Siddhartha', 'apparently', 'simple', 'tale', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'thought', 'provoking', 'text', 'Not', 'being', 'expert', 'area', 'do', 'not', 'dare', 'present', 'exegis', 'book', 'will', 'happily', 'leave', 'more', 'authoritative', 'reviewers.To', 'director', 'tried', 'tease', 'out', 'salient', 'points', 'text', 'done', 'so', 'personal', 'form', 'main', 'character', 'narrator', 'tale', 'rather', 'unfeeling', 'way', 'suggesting', 'sense', 'detatchment', 'objectivity', 'device', 'present', 'movie', 'way', 'need', 'try', 'deal', 'emotional', 'aspect', 'Siddhartha', 'inability', 'deny', 'emotions', 'sorely', 'tested', 'when', 'newly', 'found', 'son', 'runs', 'away', 'town', 'Further', 'innate', 'inability', 'recognise', 'passions', 'deal', 'sharp', 'focus', 'imbalance', 'character', 'being', 'too', 'objective', 'too', 'clever', 'too', 'logical', 'way', 'film', 'be', 'taking', 'more', 'Zen', 'approach', 'abundant', 'beauty', 'film', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'three', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'photogenic', 'beautiful', 'surroundings', 'are', 'clear', 'beautiful', 'too', 'exposure', 'poverty', 'opulence', 'camera', 'everything', 'appearance', 'beauty', 'including', 'poor', 'holy', 'men', 'again', 'highlighting', 'bad', 'feelings', 'inhumanity', 'such', 'travellers', 'pushing', 'away', 'young', 'boy', 'urgently', 'help', 'mother.There', 'beauty', 'too', 'overall', 'serenity', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'aim', 'director.Ultimately', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'too', 'many', 'levels', 'certainly', 'book', 'found', 'be', 'engrossing', 'thought', 'provoking', 'only', 'negative', 'excessive', 'echo', 'voices.This', 'must', 'anyone', 'who', 'take', 'introduction', 'Hesse', 'work', 'delving', 'text', 'worth', 'watching', 'too', 'sumptuous', 'spectacle', 'filmmaking']",Siddhartha

Those who gave this movie 1-4 stars, simply aren't ready to understand what this movie contains.  It hits the bulls-eye on every level and is quite capable of introducing the viewer to the deepest and most profound Truths of life. It is not the movies fault if the viewer is incapable of appreciating those Truths. For those who have the maturity in knowing the basic underlying realities of life and the deeper laws which guide it, this movie will not disappoint. I suggest that you watch this movie at least once a year and if you are growing mentally, emotionally  and spiritually, you will see that this movie reveals more and more to you over the years...such is it's depth and deliverance of eternal Truth. I collect DVDs that give inspiration, insight, courage, humor and appreciation of life and this movie ranks at the top of that collection. Some of those movies are: ""Little Miss Sunshine"", ""Milarepa"", ""Never Cry Wolf"", ""Outsourced"", ""Pulp Fiction"", "" Pale Rider"","" Flywheel"", ""Fireproof"", ""Facing The Giants"", ""Treasure of the Sierra Madrea"","" Whale Rider"",""Ghost Busters"", ""Modern Times"", ""The Great Dictator"", ""Amer.
