There's a shocking twist towards the middle of the film that I didn't see coming, including black and white flashback scenes which will tie up all the loose ends. Steve Zahn and Timothy Olyphant are creepy and so hilarious in this film but the biggest surprise was Milla Jovovich's peformance. Jovovoich was one of the those pretty actress' that I didn't think had much range or power, she proves me wrong in this film and she has ever since including the indie film, &#34;Dirty Girl&#34;. She has so much emotion in her eyes, you will be taken by her in this film, trust me! A Perfect Getaway also has an unrated director's cut version, which adds greatly to the story and gives more background about all 4 characters.

We meet three couples who are on vacations in Hawaii. We soon learn that a tourist couple was murdered elsewhere in Hawaii and the suspects are a young man and woman. Hummm .... Sounds like a good setup for a thriller. Several plot twists and tangents to keep you guessing. Of course we end up alone in the middle of nowhere on an island. Enough said. The plot is actually very simple and predictable. The value in the movie is in the acting and character development which casts doubt on each of the three couples. The scenery is amazing. Well photographed, good pace and some real surprises. Milla Jovovich (a favorite of mine) had a relatively minor role and didn't stand-out.This movie will keep you guessing and keep you at the edge of your seat. Why only 3 stars?

Though I ultimately enjoyed A Perfect Getaway, I guess it's one of those rarities that manages to bring out the worst in me.  But, I'll try to keep my criticism brief.Someone needs to teach the screenwriter that lying to your audience for two thirds of the film and then changing your story does not constitute a plot-twist.  It's just plain lazy writing that disparages the audiences willing suspension of disbelief.  The films direction moves what is ultimately a very trite canard with intrigue, lots of eye-candy, and gory intensity; and it commendably tries to make up for the unfounded absurdity of the plot.  The casting is also absolutely perfect for a story reliant on such blatant misdirection.  And the writing isn't all bad.  There's some fun banter; it just doesn't quite make up for the abuse of trust that befalls the stories plot.As for the Blu-ray, the presentation is exceptionally crisp and dynamic with a somewhat exaggerated color palete typical of the post production sensibilities of many modern films.  And I didn't detect any distracting ailments of compression.  The inclusion of the theatrical cut seems a little pointless, but it's good to see Universal making the effort.  There wasn't much point to the discs only physical extra, the unscripted original ending, as it's basically the same ending as in both versions of the film, minus the epilogue.One last word of warning: for any Blu-ray owners with players slower than the PS3 (ie. all older players and many newer ones, including most, if not all, Panasonic players), due to Universal's exploitive use of BD Live for self-promotive advertising, this is a VERY slow loading disc.",3,Great direction.

1289842,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002UJIY70,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 1]","While ""A Perfect Getaway"" is far from groundbreaking cinema, it does manage to keep the audience engaged all throughout. It's a thriller that plays true to itself by being misleading, which is to say that not everything is as it appears. Consider the first couple of shots; intercut with home video footage of a wedding reception is home video footage of happy newlyweds on their way to their honeymoon. The reception displays the usual mishmash of people, some quiet and complementary, some loud and obnoxious, while the newlyweds display typical post-wedding bliss. There's a moment at the reception when the groom's brother playfully has the groom's head in a headlock, obstructing the groom's face. As the newlyweds drive through dense tropical foliage, the bride holds the camera while the groom describes one of his brothers in a very unflattering light.If it seems like I'm describing mundane shots that have no bearing on the actual plot, you've got another thing coming. But of that, I can say no more. The newlyweds are Cliff and Cydney (Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich), and they're now on their Hawaiian honeymoon, eager to go hiking on an island that can only be reached by boat or by helicopter. They eventually team up with Nick and Gina (Timothy Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez), who also enjoy roughing it in the wilderness. What exactly are we supposed to make of these couples? Cliff and Cydney seem fairly happy and healthy, if a little unprepared for the outdoor life. Cliff is the least prepared of all--he can't even pitch a tent, let alone attempt something like rock climbing. Cydney is kind and approachable, although as time passes, there's the sense that what she presents as a perfect life is merely a faade.On to Nick and Gina. Nick is a military trained survivalist with a Southern drawl, and boy, does he have some stories to tell. They're the kind of stories he would like to see in a screenplay, and lo and behold, he meets Cliff, a screenwriter whose first script is now in the pre-production stages of filming up in Canada. Nick, it seems, it quite aware of the conventions certain movies go by, not the least of which is the twist ending in the second act. But this isn't all he's aware of, and we know this not only through his dialogue, which is carefully worded, but although through his actions, which are subtle yet significant. He never shouts, and he never threatens, but the man is intense and menacing, someone who should be feared just on general principles. ""He's really difficult to kill,"" Gina observes.And speaking of Gina, she's calmer and a bit more trusting, but she's worked in the meat section of her hometown Piggly Wiggly, and she knows how to slice open a carcass and disembowel it.Soon, the news begins to spread: A couple has been murdered in Honolulu, and the police suspect both a man and a woman as the culprits. Cliff and Cydney recall a hitchhiking couple they encountered when they first arrived; the woman, Cleo (Marley Shelton), seemed eager to share her wedding photos, but the man, Kale (Chris Hemsworth), was angry and wouldn't accept the ride. He was especially angry with Cliff, who not only lied but also had a very off-putting tone in his voice. Kale, he later admits, is tired of people always spitting in his face just for the way he looks.Yes, it's possible that they're the killers the police are looking for. But what about Nick and Gina? What about Cliff and Cydney? What if it's no one we've seen thus far? After all, there seems to be someone following both couples as they hike, and Nick, armed with a bow and arrow and a hunting knife, wastes no time in trying to get to the bottom of it. Appearances mean nothing in this movie, and we already know that because the concept of the plot twist has already been addressed by Nick.Interestingly, that may be the reason why the film loses some steam during the final twenty minutes. The twist, in all honesty, isn't all that surprising, and that's because we know that the nature of ""A Perfect Getaway"" is to misdirect. I can't elaborate on this, but rest assured, you'll know what I mean if you see this movie.This isn't to say, however, that the twist doesn't altogether work. What could easily have been a ridiculous copout instead seems plausible. At the very least, it seems plausible within the context of this story. Nevertheless, the first section of ""A Perfect Getaway"" is stronger, not just in the way that it builds tension, but also in the way it explores character. The single best scene is of Cydney revealing to Gina something she has kept hidden for many years; Jovovich is given the emotional dialogue while Sanchez is given the subtlety of expression, and they play off each other very well. Many moments between Zahn and Olyphant are also well done, helped by the fact that the story gives Zahn better range as an actor. On the whole, ""A Perfect Getaway"" is a conventional yet effective thriller, with an absorbing mystery that actually builds suspense.",4,Who Amongst Us is Capable of Murder?,1250121600,"08 13, 2009",2009,4996,"['A', 'Perfect', 'Getaway', 'far', 'groundbreaking', 'cinema', 'manage', 'keep', 'audience', 'engaged', 'thriller', 'true', 'being', 'misleading', 'say', 'not', 'everything', 'Consider', 'first', 'couple', 'shots', 'intercut', 'home', 'video', 'footage', 'wedding', 'reception', 'home', 'video', 'footage', 'happy', 'newlyweds', 'way', 'honeymoon', 'reception', 'usual', 'mishmash', 'people', 'quiet', 'complementary', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'newlyweds', 'display', 'typical', 'post-wedding', 'bliss', 'moment', 'reception', 'when', 'groom', 'brother', 'playfully', 'groom', 'head', 'headlock', 'obstructing', 'groom', 'face', 'newlyweds', 'drive', 'dense', 'tropical', 'foliage', 'bride', 'camera', 'groom', 'one', 'brothers', 'very', 'unflattering', 'light.If', ""'m"", 'describing', 'mundane', 'shots', 'have', 'bearing', 'actual', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'got', 'thing', 'coming', 'can', 'say', 'more', 'newlyweds', 'are', 'Cliff', 'Cydney', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', ""'re"", 'now', 'Hawaiian', 'honeymoon', 'eager', 'go', 'hiking', 'island', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'reached', 'boat', 'helicopter', 'eventually', 'team', 'up', 'Nick', 'Gina', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Kiele', 'Sanchez', 'who', 'also', 'enjoy', 'roughing', 'wilderness', 'What', 'exactly', 'are', 'supposed', 'make', 'couples', 'Cliff', 'Cydney', 'seem', 'fairly', 'happy', 'healthy', 'little', 'unprepared', 'outdoor', 'life', 'Cliff', 'least', 'prepared', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'pitch', 'tent', 'let', 'alone', 'attempt', 'something', 'rock', 'climbing', 'Cydney', 'kind', 'approachable', 'time', 'passes', 'sense', 'what', 'perfect', 'life', 'merely', 'faade.On', 'Nick', 'Gina', 'Nick', 'military', 'trained', 'survivalist', 'Southern', 'drawl', 'boy', 'have', 'stories', 'tell', ""'re"", 'kind', 'stories', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'screenplay', 'lo', 'behold', 'Cliff', 'screenwriter', 'first', 'script', 'now', 'pre-production', 'stages', 'filming', 'up', 'Canada', 'Nick', 'quite', 'aware', 'conventions', 'certain', 'movies', 'go', 'not', 'least', 'twist', 'ending', 'second', 'act', ""n't"", 'aware', 'know', 'not', 'only', 'dialogue', 'carefully', 'worded', 'actions', 'are', 'subtle', 'yet', 'significant', 'never', 'never', 'man', 'intense', 'menacing', 'someone', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'feared', 'just', 'general', 'principles', 'really', 'difficult', 'kill', 'Gina', 'observes.And', 'speaking', 'Gina', 'calmer', 'bit', 'more', 'trusting', 'worked', 'meat', 'section', 'hometown', 'Piggly', 'Wiggly', 'how', 'slice', 'open', 'carcass', 'disembowel', 'it.Soon', 'news', 'spread', 'couple', 'been', 'murdered', 'Honolulu', 'police', 'suspect', 'man', 'woman', 'culprits', 'Cliff', 'Cydney', 'recall', 'hitchhiking', 'couple', 'encountered', 'when', 'first', 'arrived', 'woman', 'Cleo', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'seemed', 'eager', 'share', 'wedding', 'photos', 'man', 'Kale', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'was', 'angry', 'would', ""n't"", 'accept', 'ride', 'was', 'especially', 'angry', 'Cliff', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'lied', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'off-putting', 'tone', 'voice', 'Kale', 'later', 'tired', 'people', 'always', 'spitting', 'face', 'just', 'way', 'possible', ""'re"", 'killers', 'police', 'are', 'looking', 'what', 'Nick', 'Gina', 'What', 'Cliff', 'Cydney', 'What', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thus', 'far', 'be', 'someone', 'following', 'couples', 'hike', 'Nick', 'armed', 'bow', 'arrow', 'hunting', 'knife', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'bottom', 'Appearances', 'mean', 'nothing', 'movie', 'already', 'know', 'concept', 'plot', 'twist', 'already', 'been', 'addressed', 'Nick.Interestingly', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'steam', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'twist', 'honesty', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'know', 'nature', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Getaway', 'misdirect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'elaborate', 'rest', 'assured', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'see', 'movie.This', ""n't"", 'say', 'however', 'twist', ""n't"", 'altogether', 'work', 'What', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'ridiculous', 'copout', 'instead', 'plausible', 'very', 'least', 'plausible', 'context', 'story', 'Nevertheless', 'first', 'section', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Getaway', 'stronger', 'not', 'just', 'way', 'tension', 'also', 'way', 'character', 'single', 'best', 'scene', 'Cydney', 'revealing', 'Gina', 'something', 'kept', 'hidden', 'many', 'years', 'Jovovich', 'given', 'emotional', 'dialogue', 'Sanchez', 'given', 'subtlety', 'expression', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'Many', 'moments', 'Zahn', 'Olyphant', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'helped', 'fact', 'story', 'Zahn', 'better', 'range', 'actor', 'whole', 'Perfect', 'Getaway', 'conventional', 'yet', 'effective', 'thriller', 'absorbing', 'mystery', 'actually', 'suspense']",N/A

The guy is brilliant. Few actors can laugh your socks off, make you cry, and freak you out; Zahn is one of the best at all three and he's only getting better.He stars in A Perfect Getaway as Cliff, a Hollywood screenwriter on his honeymoon with Cydney (Milla Jovovich). The two lovebirds have decided to `get away' for their honeymoon, to Hawaii. Things look promising that they'll have a good time; save for the fact that another couple on their honeymoon was murdered very recently, on a nearby Island. Surely they have nothing to worry about though, because what are the odds the killer would come to their island? To them - not likely; for us as audience members watching a thriller - it's as good as inevitable.So we know the killer will show up at some point, but what we have to do now is figure out who it will be. We are introduced very early on, to a couple of hitchhikers, and when things don't go over so well between the two couples; we have our first suspects. Surely they will pop again sooner or later.Crossing a dangerously slippery waterfall, we meet a guy who could easily be Rambo's long lost brother. The sensational Timothy Olyphant plays Nick, an ex military stud who is, and I'm quoting him and his girlfriend here, ""Really hard to kill."" Nick and his girl Gina have us suspicious but could they really be the killers?Cliff and Cydney aren't exactly sure about them, but they seem to know their way around the island pretty well; and when the hitchhikers show up again, anyone would make better company. So they tag along with Nick and Gina and things get very interesting.There is really no way to describe much more, without ruining the film. It's a fast paced, in your face thriller. It's edgy and full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing. The characters are all beautifully designed and well-acted. Everyone was believable and kept your head spinning in regards to who was really who. The film had a Hitchcock feel to it, but it also had the hype and current look that a film like Scream would bring you.The film is written and directed by David Twohy. Between both trades, he's given us a ton of great films to include Pitch Black and its sequels, Waterworld, The Fugitive, The Arrival and G.I. Jane, to name only a few. His latest film, A Perfect Getaway is exactly that, for any fan of film with 97 minutes to invest.

""W.""","[3, 8]","When I rented this movie, people were talking about the big twist ending.... unfortunately I am one of the few people who actually paid attention to the beginning of the movie, so for me there was absolutely no twist.  I seriously thought that everyone knew what I knew right from the beginning, so by the time the so called ""twist"" was revealed I was completely confused.

How could you NOT notice that, first of all the beginning of wedding footage never directly showed the bride and grooms faces, giving one cause to wonder why, thus making you pay more attention to the wedding footage.  So after more wedding footage is shown we actually see enough of the faces of the bride and groom to see, that it is NOT Mila Jovovich or Steve Zahn as the bride and groom, but someone totally different.  Therefore when you see they have the camera of the couple, and the information about the slain couple is revealed, it's a given that they were the one's who killed and replaced the bride and groom.  It was obvious to me anyway.  That's why when they revealed them as the killers I couldn't figure out how that was twisty in any way whatsoever.  This made the movie a bit boring for me.  Then I thought, maybe the twist was Mila saying it was okay to kill Steve... but that wasn't a big surprise either, after their talk on the beach.

The first half reminded me of a story in which every time you opened a door a ghost jumped out and said ""Boo!"" Eventually it's just not scary anymore. That's the first half.Instead of a haunted house, this film is set in Hawaii. The scenery is spectacular. The key players are two couples who hike along a remote trail. They learn two newlyweds were brutally murdered just days before in Honolulu (they're on another island, Kauai) and have reason to suspect each other. There's a wicked looking knife, a hatchet, and fleeting glances of figures slipping through the dense tropical vegetation. One character, portrayed by the best actor of the lot, Timothy Olyphant, has a titanium plate in his skull (necessitated by an Iraq war wound, he claims) and likes to tell weird stories. Another character has a combative, menacing air. But the suspense factor hovered around zero. It was all rather mind numbing, although the cinematography was stunning.Somewhere past the halfway point, however, it all took a sudden turn that completely surprised me.

1289854,AHPV4F8IVSC39,B002UJIY70,"Douglas B. Moran ""Computer+History/Politics""","[3, 15]","I am someone who has seen enough movies and pays attention to what is going on that I frequently pick up on the shot that doesn't quite belong, the cut-away at an unnatural point, odd phrasings, ...  If you are this sort of person, there is no suspense in this movie: Almost from the very beginning, I suspected what the twist was, by about 10 minutes in I was reasonably certain, and at 17:35 it was effectively confirmed (Director's Cut times).  Until the ""twist"" was explicitly revealed, there was such a continuing barrage of these hints that people like me have problems understanding how others could have missed all of them (and I have friends in that category).  My objection is _not_ that the movie gives you hints of the twist--I would be upset if it gave none (cheating)--but rather that there should have been only enough to create the ambiguity that creates suspense.When the ""twist"" is explicitly revealed, there is a _long_ ""intermission"" (in B/W) that may end the movie for you (I did email waiting for the story to resume).  This slow-paced interruption enumerates details no longer important or of interest (relative to the movie experience) plus a tedious tangent.Even if you aren't one who spotted the twist, you may well find the attempt to build suspense to be so ham-handed that it has no emotional impact.  All the characters in the three couples are ""off"" enough, often in unbelievable ways, that not only did I not have any empathy for any of them--necessary for suspense--but I disliked them enough that I found myself half-hoping that they would be killed early on.  However, because of my age (50s) and nature, I am a harder ""sell"" than most for establishing empathy.Good suspense movies work despite their (inevitable) logical holes because the pacing keeps your from noticing them or pursuing them, or it keeps you so emotionally involved that you willingly accept them.  Here, the pacing is labored and so erratic/uneven that it never approaches the necessary momentum.If you have seen more than a few thriller movies in your life, you will see nothing new here, and those retread ""thrills"" are prosaic, predictable and telegraphed well in advance.  Some of the attempts to build tension were so badly executed that they do the opposite.  Mistakes and misinterpretations are expected, but when the script makes character(s) ""too stupid to live"" and tries to build tension by stretching out those segments expecting me to empathize with such characters, the movie instead alienates me.  At the end, I was rooting for the police to shoot the couple being stalked, which would have had the added benefit of being an interesting minor twist of letting the serial killers escape detection (as the lesser evil/idiots).This movie inconceivably fails to capture even a small fraction of the beauty of its location (based on std DVD), although there are a few shots showing the potential.  Even an amateur has difficulty not taking breath-taking pictures (personal experience). Good cinematography could have offset a legion of failings.For Milla Jovovich fans, be aware that a substantial portion of her close-ups are in the B/W segment, something that should get the director a lifetime ban.  And there is only a fleeting bit with her as action star.Aside: Indicative of how little attention was paid to the script, the ""hard to kill"" character claims he survived the Sioux Falls DC-10 crash (UA 232) because of ""situational awareness"". That crash is ancient history (1989) for both the character and the audience, and it was luck--where you were seated--that determined who survived.  It would have taken the writers only a brief visit to Wikipedia to find a suitable update to maintain the ambiguity about the character's claims and whether the others should believe them.And what confirmed the ""twist"" to me was a reference to a 1994 event, although being so dated was part of what made it more than just a hint.",1,"No suspense for the experienced, retread ""thrills"", disappointing cinematography",1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,3940,"['am', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'enough', 'movies', 'pays', 'attention', 'what', 'going', 'frequently', 'pick', 'up', 'shot', ""n't"", 'quite', 'belong', 'cut-away', 'unnatural', 'point', 'odd', 'phrasings', 'are', 'sort', 'person', 'suspense', 'movie', 'Almost', 'very', 'beginning', 'suspected', 'what', 'twist', 'was', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'reasonably', 'certain', '17:35', 'was', 'effectively', 'confirmed', 'Director', 'Cut', 'times', 'twist', 'was', 'explicitly', 'revealed', 'was', 'such', 'continuing', 'barrage', 'hints', 'people', 'have', 'problems', 'understanding', 'how', 'others', 'could', 'have', 'missed', 'have', 'friends', 'category', 'objection', '_not_', 'movie', 'hints', 'twist', 'would', 'be', 'upset', 'gave', 'none', 'cheating', 'rather', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'enough', 'create', 'ambiguity', 'suspense.When', 'twist', 'explicitly', 'revealed', '_long_', 'intermission', 'B/W', 'may', 'end', 'movie', 'did', 'email', 'waiting', 'story', 'resume', 'slow-paced', 'interruption', 'details', 'no', 'longer', 'important', 'interest', 'relative', 'movie', 'experience', 'tedious', 'tangent.Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'one', 'who', 'spotted', 'twist', 'may', 'well', 'find', 'attempt', 'build', 'suspense', 'be', 'so', 'ham-handed', 'emotional', 'impact', 'characters', 'three', 'couples', 'are', 'enough', 'often', 'unbelievable', 'ways', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'empathy', 'necessary', 'suspense', 'disliked', 'found', 'half-hoping', 'would', 'be', 'killed', 'early', 'However', 'age', '50s', 'nature', 'am', 'harder', 'sell', 'most', 'establishing', 'empathy.Good', 'suspense', 'movies', 'work', 'inevitable', 'logical', 'holes', 'pacing', 'keeps', 'noticing', 'pursuing', 'so', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'willingly', 'accept', 'Here', 'pacing', 'labored', 'so', 'erratic/uneven', 'never', 'necessary', 'momentum.If', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'few', 'thriller', 'movies', 'life', 'will', 'see', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'retread', 'thrills', 'are', 'prosaic', 'predictable', 'telegraphed', 'well', 'advance', 'attempts', 'build', 'tension', 'were', 'so', 'badly', 'executed', 'do', 'opposite', 'Mistakes', 'misinterpretations', 'are', 'expected', 'when', 'script', 'character', 'too', 'stupid', 'live', 'tries', 'build', 'tension', 'stretching', 'out', 'segments', 'expecting', 'empathize', 'such', 'characters', 'movie', 'instead', 'end', 'was', 'rooting', 'police', 'shoot', 'couple', 'being', 'stalked', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'added', 'benefit', 'being', 'interesting', 'minor', 'twist', 'letting', 'serial', 'killers', 'escape', 'detection', 'lesser', 'evil/idiots', '.This', 'movie', 'inconceivably', 'capture', 'even', 'small', 'fraction', 'beauty', 'location', 'based', 'std', 'DVD', 'are', 'few', 'shots', 'showing', 'potential', 'Even', 'amateur', 'difficulty', 'not', 'taking', 'breath-taking', 'pictures', 'personal', 'experience', 'Good', 'cinematography', 'could', 'have', 'offset', 'legion', 'failings.For', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'fans', 'be', 'aware', 'substantial', 'portion', 'close-ups', 'are', 'B/W', 'segment', 'something', 'should', 'get', 'director', 'lifetime', 'ban', 'only', 'fleeting', 'bit', 'action', 'star.Aside', 'Indicative', 'how', 'little', 'attention', 'was', 'paid', 'script', 'hard', 'kill', 'character', 'survived', 'Sioux', 'Falls', 'DC-10', 'crash', 'UA', '232', 'situational', 'awareness', 'crash', 'ancient', 'history', '1989', 'character', 'audience', 'was', 'luck', 'where', 'were', 'seated', 'determined', 'who', 'survived', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'writers', 'only', 'brief', 'visit', 'Wikipedia', 'find', 'suitable', 'update', 'maintain', 'ambiguity', 'character', 'claims', 'others', 'should', 'believe', 'them.And', 'what', 'confirmed', 'twist', 'was', 'reference', '1994', 'event', 'being', 'so', 'dated', 'was', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'more', 'just', 'hint']",N/A

1289860,ATYVBUA5E1IDW,B002UJIY70,Graham,"[1, 2]","A Perfect Getaway is a problematic film to review. Like the recently released The Book of Eli, it comes complete with a fairly ridiculous third-act twist; but I guess many twists are ridiculous these days. After all, how many twists can there be out there? Unfortunately there are also numerous problems with David Twohy`s direction, which is, to put it bluntly, generally shoddy and haphazard. And finally there is Milla Jovovich, who while seeming pleasant enough, once again proves that she's only worth casting if she is killing zombies or scaling futuristic skyscrapers. For whatever reason, Jovovich seems to have difficulty delivering a believable performance when cast as a normal woman. This problem rears its ugly head once again in A Perfect Getaway. Having said all that, I'm still recommending this film. Between the lush jungle setting, intriguing and suspenseful premise, and a charismatic and magnetic performance by one Timothy Olyphant, A Perfect Getaway still manages to deliver despite some questionable directorial decisions, one bad lead performance, and a rather lame twist.The film begins with hand-held footage of the recent wedding of our protagonists, Cliff and Sydney, played by Steve Zahn and Miss Jovovich, respectively. Luckily, the footage lasts only through the credits before that tired trope is abandoned in favor of a largely-traditional filming style (more on that later). The newlyweds are honeymooning in Hawaii and it's not long before they are headed off to a long hike through the Hawaiian jungle, complete with waterfalls, beaches, and all manner of magnificent scenery. Along the way they meet two other couples, a sketchy pair of free spirits who they come in to conflict with almost immediately, and a second pair, Nick and Gina, portrayed by Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez. This couple also intends to hike the trail and the four of them decide to stick together. It's not long before they come across a group of hysterical young women who are claiming that vacationers have been murdered on a neighboring island. The rumor is that it was a pair of killers, a man and a woman. With the set up complete, both couples continue their descent into the jungle, unsure of who they can trust, or just how far they will make it.Nick (Olyphant) has all sorts of crazy and unbelievable stories from his time as a Special Forces commando/Navy Seal/spook, and Olyphant has a ball with the character who ""is really hard to kill."" When given the freedom to let loose, as he is here, the underrated Olyphant is capable of delivering an insanely charismatic performance, a performance in which you simply can't take your eyes off him. Nick's not the biggest guy in the world, but he's incredibly ripped and when combined with his violent background and devilish grin, the audience will feel both drawn to him and threatened by him. The fact that he's such a mysterious, dangerous, yet strangely endearing figure only adds to the performance. It's safe to say that without Timothy Olyphant this film simply would not work. He is that good, and while it's no award-winning performance, it is exactly what's desired in a popcorn thriller such as this. I have been a fan of Olyphant's since 1998's Go, and it's nice to see his profile rising as his career moves forward.Steve Zahn also does a great job in the comparatively thankless role of our hero Cliff, the rather square screenwriter who hikes through the jungle complete with glasses, dorky ball cap, and camcorder. Also of note is Chris Hemsworth, seen previously in Star Trek and soon to hit the mainstream as the title character in Marvel Studios' Thor. Hemsworth cuts an imposing figure as half of the aforementioned sketchy couple and his presence looms over the proceedings like a dark storm cloud.So the setting is highly appealing, the premise intriguing, and Timothy Olyphant's screen presence alone makes up for Milla Jovovich's subpar acting. What about the direction? The glue that holds everything together? Unfortunately, this marks the film's weak point as David Twohy makes several questionable artistic decisions which end up detracting from the film. During the film's third act there are several instances when the screen inexplicably switches to a split screen view, sometimes with up to 3 or 4 screens. This occurs when lots of action is taking place and the effect is disorienting, jarring, and confusing. It can be really tough to tell just who is doing what and I can't help but think that Twohy would have been better off just leaving it alone. This unfortunate tendency to rely on gimmicks pops up again a cringe-worthy and awkward chunk of exposition. Planted firmly in the middle of the third act, he decided that the audience needed a nearly ten minute long blue-tinted flashback. Not only is the blue saturation deeply distracting, but the awkwardly placed exposition is meant to be a shocking moment, when instead it just conveys Twohy's lack of confidence in his own script. And then of course, there is the twist. I'm sure many people will see it coming from a mile away, yet I did not (I have never been too good at guessing twists). To say anymore would be to give away a pretty decent surprise, but it's only really decent in the moment. Once the movie ends, you will find yourself second-guessing the logic behind it and that's never a good sign.A Perfect Getaway is in no way a perfect movie, yet it somehow remains engaging and exciting. Much of this can be attributed to the sheer overwhelming charisma of Timothy Olyphant, who at times seems to hoist the entire film on his back as he treks through the Hawaiian jungle. Sure some of the director`s decisions were questionable and the ending is a bit bizarre, but honestly, you probably won't care too much. As far as thrillers go, this one is entertaining and above average. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",4,"Not ""Perfect"" but definitely worth a watch",1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,5864,"['Perfect', 'Getaway',

There are 3 sets of couples and any of them could be the killer. You don't know who the killer is until over half way into the movie, then it has a flashback of everything that happened. It is a little boring until it gets to that part though. Then the movie starts getting a lot of action with twists and turns. The movie looks great on Blu-ray with just a few scenes with grain. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of special features. There is only one and it is an alternate ending. It is a little different than the ending of the movie, but I was hoping for more.

But this has some stars attached, and I'm fairly shallow in that way. The plot: ""Two couples are trekking in a remote island location where psychos are stalking and brutally murdering couples.""As Eddie Izzard once observed about B-movie characters, ""Don't they listen to the music?"". Don't they wonder why it's called the Forest of Death and Blood? Pretty much all the character have had their common sense glands removed, and do something incredibly stupid in almost every scene. Even after the 'reserved screenwriter hero' stops to pick up psycho hitchhikers - a ""wow, my IQ just dropped"" moment - then everyone is armed to the teeth with knives, axes and stabby things - and nobody thinks this is very weird. Or alarming. Like I would.The most irritating flaw in the film is the post-modern self-aware screenplay discussion that goes on, Tarantino-esque, but in a way that the average audience member doesn't care about or understand. If music had verses explaining the structure, it would be strange enough, but for a film to talk about its own Act 2 twist, Act 3 reversal and bad guy cliches is grating and unnecessary. That said, it does signal the supposedly ""big twist"" that happens at the beginning of Act 3. The big twist is about as improbable as you can imagine and leaves a whole pile of threads undone.The final 30 minutes must have seen the arrival of LSD in the editing booth, since the style moves from scene-cut-scene-cut to cut-cut-overlay-cut-cut-overlay-cut-cut-cut. There are some pretty gory moments in between, and plenty of random one-page characters who get clean shots to the head (an accuracy that is mysteriously lost when the bad guy tries to shoot our heroes).Anyway, all-in-all it's a very good B-movie but shows the chasm between B and A that still exists. Even though I went to Hawaii on my honeymoon, I'm now recommending against it based upon the crazed killers that stalk the islands and the incompetent police who shoot people from helicopters. It was missing two vital B-movie ingredients, however - dumb-but-attractive teenagers trying to make out and find somewhere to do the bad thing, and then the subsequent gruesome deaths of said teenagers who are always punished in the Puritanical rules of B-movie slasher folklore.",2,A Very Good B-Movie Masquerading As A-Grade,1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,2441,"['almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'rent', 'sounded', 'could', 'be', 'slasher', 'pic', 'lines', 'Touristas', 'top', '2', 'hours', 'sick', 'voyeuristic', 'snuff', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'stars', 'attached', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'shallow', 'way', 'plot', 'Two', 'couples', 'are', 'trekking', 'remote', 'island', 'location', 'where', 'psychos', 'are', 'stalking', 'brutally', 'murdering', 'couples', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'once', 'observed', 'B-movie', 'characters', 'Do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'music', 'Do', ""n't"", 'wonder', 'why', 'called', 'Forest', 'Death', 'Blood', 'Pretty', 'much', 'character', 'have', 'had', 'common', 'sense', 'removed', 'do', 'something', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'almost', 'scene', 'Even', ""'reserved"", 'screenwriter', 'hero', 'stops', 'pick', 'up', 'psycho', 'hitchhikers', 'wow', 'IQ', 'just', 'dropped', 'moment', 'then', 'everyone', 'armed', 'teeth', 'knives', 'axes', 'stabby', 'things', 'nobody', 'thinks', 'very', 'weird', 'alarming', 'would.The', 'most', 'irritating', 'flaw', 'film', 'post-modern', 'self-aware', 'screenplay', 'discussion', 'Tarantino-esque', 'way', 'average', 'audience', 'member', ""n't"", 'care', 'understand', 'music', 'had', 'verses', 'explaining', 'structure', 'would', 'be', 'strange', 'enough', 'film', 'talk', 'own', 'Act', '2', 'twist', 'Act', '3', 'reversal', 'bad', 'guy', 'cliches', 'grating', 'unnecessary', 'said', 'signal', 'supposedly', 'big', 'twist', 'beginning', 'Act', '3', 'big', 'twist', 'as', 'improbable', 'can', 'imagine', 'whole', 'pile', 'threads', 'undone.The', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'arrival', 'LSD', 'editing', 'booth', 'style', 'moves', 'scene-cut-scene-cut', 'cut-cut-overlay-cut-cut-overlay-cut-cut-cut', 'are', 'pretty', 'gory', 'moments', 'plenty', 'random', 'one-page', 'characters', 'who', 'get', 'clean', 'shots', 'head', 'accuracy', 'mysteriously', 'lost', 'when', 'bad', 'guy', 'tries', 'shoot', 'heroes', '.Anyway', 'all-in-all', 'very', 'good', 'B-movie', 'chasm', 'B', 'A', 'still', 'Even', 'went', 'Hawaii', 'honeymoon', ""'m"", 'now', 'recommending', 'based', 'crazed', 'killers', 'stalk', 'islands', 'incompetent', 'police', 'who', 'shoot', 'people', 'helicopters', 'was', 'missing', 'two', 'vital', 'B-movie', 'ingredients', 'however', 'dumb-but-attractive', 'teenagers', 'trying', 'make', 'out', 'find', 'somewhere', 'do', 'bad', 'thing', 'then', 'subsequent', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'said', 'teenagers', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'punished', 'Puritanical', 'rules', 'B-movie', 'slasher', 'folklore']",N/A

After running into two more hiking couples, two of the people are Gina (Kiele Sanchez, TV's ""The Glades"") and Nick (Timothy Olyphant, ""Live Free or Die Hard"") and soon after everyone suspects the others could be the deadly couple and violence occurs.It does pick up after a while and the violence spices it up, so do the performances by Milla, Zahn and especially Timothy who as Gina states a couple of times just seems hard to kill. Its not a great film mind you but I mostly enjoyed the flick, it had a breezy air about it and while the reveal of the killer's is of no shock to anyone who has seen more than oh say two horror movies it is done in a goofy and funny way. The final sequences between the killers and the surviving characters are actually very well done and do keep your pulse up.I'll give credit to director David Twohy (""Pitch Black"") for making a conventional plot at least fun to watch, cause the trailer is somewhat misleading (for obvious reasons mind you once you watch the actual film).

Director David Twohy, the mind behind the less cohesive Pitch Black and Riddick films, gives us a fully realized and nearly impeccable who-dun-it joy ride.Anchored by committed actors and actresses that bounce off of one another flawlessly, Jovovich, Olyphant and, especially, Zahn, are in pitch perfect form, abiding by the peculiar idiosyncrasies of their characters.  Their surprisingly limber chemistry makes every scene a joy to watch unfold.It's a dense, taut, and undeniably original film that abides by classic Hollywood ingredients, refusing to appeal to an industry saturated by an excess of torture porn and nihilistic horror.  If you're tired of feeling drained and deflated subsequent to your viewings of the next big scare-fest, this is a movie for you.  It's charm will make you smile ear to ear.  Too often do pretentious visionaries forget their audience along the arduous path towards ambiguous, avant garde cinema.  You may understand me, then, when I say that Perfect Getaway is a film that gives a lot and expects nothing from the audience that may detract from their unabashed enjoyment.Gleefully clever, quietly stylish, and filled a giddy tension that will keep you both exhilarated and unsettled, Perfect Getaway is the best thriller of the year.

It has gorgeous cinematography and while it moves slowly, it successfully builds up tension with character development rather than relying on black cats jumping out of closets or severed body parts every ten minutes.The tale is about three couples in Hawaii and one couple could be a pair of murders from the big island.Our protagonist couple (Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich) is a bit nerdy and a bit goofy. Jovovich in particular gives a wonderfully awkward performance in body language and facial expressions.Trying to get into the Hawaii spirit our protagonist honeymooners attempt to do a favor for a second couple hitchhiking (Marley Shelton and Chris Hemsworth), but Hemsworth gives off such a bad vibe that the Zahn and Jovoich are naturally concerned about running into him on the trail again.They take refuge with the ""cool"" couple (Timothy Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez). Olyphant in particular simply cascades charisma onto the screen even when attempting to convince others he has a plate in his head from his Special Forces days. But even the cool couple could just as easily be the killers (after all Olyphant seems to like fondling his special forces knife a bit two much and this is a movie.)All this interaction is among well placed news reports that a non-nondescript couple is wanted for questioning for a murder and are suspected in being on the same trail as our plucky honeymooners.Director Twohy isn't back in Pitch Black form but he shows a surer directing hand than he did in Chronicles of Riddick and he gets better performances out of his actors than he did in Below. In fact for a movie with basically six people and very little action the film rests almost exclusively on the actor's shoulders. The actors certainly hold up their end of the bargain across the board.The movie does cheat a bit as I stated before but this is a thriller rather than a mystery (after all there are only three couples in the whole film) and the journey is more fun than the reveal. In fact the movie has such a relaxed pace and vibe you can easily forget it is a thriller at all.

Very little noticeable grain (and not distracting). Sound was also very good throughout.The disappointment with the Blu-Ray (and DVD) comes in terms of the special features - it has the ""Unrated directors cut"" (as well as theatrical version) and an original ending. No commentary, no U-Control picture in picture, no behind the scenes, no outtakes. Nothing!

1289895,A3OJERVDCVKUGL,B002UJIY70,"M Marsh ""Mermarsh""","[1, 1]","A thoroughly enjoyable film. Like so many other reviewers here, I found this DVD by following what seems by now to be a very well-trodden line of breadcrumbs from Timothy Olyphant's other work, notably Deadwood. I'm not certain I would like every single scrap of film he has made (as yet I've avoided the science fiction), but from what I have seen so far I am beginning to suspect that Olyphant never turns in a bad performance. (For example, although I'm a female with zero interest in video games, I loved Hitman.) In this case Kiele Sanchez helps matters out with her usual contagious smile and warm charm, while Steve Zahn is marvelous in a role slightly different from his normal ones. Puerto Rico, disguised as Hawaii, is charming as well, making the whole ride gorgeous to behold. Knowing in advance that there was a ""twist,"" I did guess it soon in - mostly because it was so logical - but I didn't feel much conviction because I wasn't certain that such a dramatic turnaround could work. In the end, however, I thought it worked just fine. I must confess, though, that my husband, sitting beside me, was gnashing his teeth with frustration soon into the movie, protesting that the plot made no sense whatever. My own suspicion is that this difference is less about believability than the fact that I have much more tolerance for slicing and dicing in movies than he does (he's fine with guns). I mean, his favorite film is Vertigo. That it's a masterpiece we both agree, but is it really all that ""plausible""? On the other hand, when knives come out he and I normally agree that I'll tell him when it's safe to open his eyes again. So perhaps I should add a warning that people who greatly dislike seeing knives come out and ""blood"" spill in movies should think twice here.

I had been anticipating it for a while- It had Milla Jovovichand Steve Zahn, two notoriously good actors, and it looked brutal andfun. So we went to the cinema to go see it. And I walked out VERYsatisfied! At 98 minutes, A Perfect Getaway is a great mix of suspense,dark comedy, action, and good acting!Two newlyweds named Cliff and Cydney go on their honeymoon in beautifulHawaiian mountains. They decide to backpacking to this beautiful beach,Along the way they meet a couple, the guy's name is Nick and the Girl'sname is Giele. Nick is a former US Army officer, and Giele is a sweetsouthern girl who has learned tricks for things like hunting. They goalong with them.However, there's two killers who have done killing on the same island,and this causes many people to be worried. However, the four realizethe further they go, the closer they get to being maimed by thekillers...This is the perfect thriller, and hands down one of the best movies of09. Twohy is a filmmaker I'm not fond of, I did NOT like either of theRiddick films, and even more so, he's just not a great filmmaker ingeneral. But here he takes a simple concept and turns it into acomplex, multi-layered story that has the audience on the edges oftheir seats for the 98 minute runtime.Halfway through, the film takes an interesting turn with a shockingplot twist. Instead of just saving the twist until the end so it can beOMGZ SHOCKING, it is revealed halfway through. Then we go and discoverhow that twist is possible in a 10 minute B&W; flashback that shows ushow it's possible. Even more so, for the first half we're worried forone couple. Then after the twist, we're worried for the others. Rarelyever has a good thriller ever done that. I earned new respect for Twohyupon watching this happen, and it's part of what made me walk out ofthe theater at the end going ""Whoa, that was an effing good movie.""The film is not without it's dark comedy too. Don't let the trailer foolyou into thinking it's a brutal and ugly film that'll disturb you. Ithas a good deal of dark comedy in it. It's done in the most subtle waypossible- it's not randomly placed, it's well placed. And the bestthing is, a lot of it happens in the horrible stuff. There are couplescenes where we're not sure if we should be going ""That's HORRIBLE!"" orjust laughing our butts off.

1289909,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002UJIY70,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[6, 8]","A Perfect Getaway (David Twohy, 2009)I've seen a good number of David Twohy's movies at this point, both those he's directed and those for which he's just been a screenwriter, and they all seem to be missing something, even those I've come to love over the years (for example, the nonexistent character development in Pitch Black). Of course, there's more than one thing wrong with some of them (can we say Waterworld?), but in general, they're pretty decent movies with some sort of standout problem that keeps them from being the best movies they can be. While it's not a technical fault in this case--and that tells me that Twohy has finally come close to really putting it all together--A Perfect Getaway has one major failing, and it blew the movie for me.Plot: Cliff (Sunshine Cleaning's Steve Zahn) and Cydney (Milla Jovovich, recently of the Resident Evil movies) are a newlywed couple honeymooning in Hawaii. Another newlywed couple have just been murdered in Honolulu, and the police, according to a couple of hikers they meet, are looking for a man and a woman. Which isn't a problem, except that they keep running into Nick (Dreamcatcher's Timothy Olyphant) and Gina (Insanitarium's Kiele Sanchez), a trailer-trash couple who happen to be hiking the same otherwise-deserted trail with them.The big failing, of course, is that most of the people I've talked to figured out the Big Reveal either from watching the trailers or from reading a review that lets you know something really, really important that I'm trying my best to avoid. And for those who didn't quite figure it out from one of those, there's one scene less than halfway into the movie (which was shown during a special about the movie on the Current TV network, whoops) that gives the game away pretty clearly. And it seems to me that when you're writing a suspense film, it's not really a good idea to let your audience know the ending before, you know, you get to the ending. But then, I can kind of understand what Twohy was trying to do, and I have to give him respect for trying it (basically, it's a riff on Dario Argento's Profondo Rosso, and no one tries it because it's basically impossible to pull of unless you're Dario Argento). Other than that, it was a pretty intelligent thriller (though I admit I had to think about one of the scenes for a while before I realized there wasn't a plot hole big enough to drive a truck through in it), competently directed, with some surprisingly decent acting (especially from Jovovich, who's never really shown much in the way of acting ability) and gorgeous photography. All of it, however, comes entirely unglued during the Big Reveal. Perhaps it's a good thing so many of us figured it out so long beforehand, because if I didn't know what was going to happen already, I'd have been really, really confused by the fragmented, incomplete way in which the Big Reveal is revealed. (Big-ly.)One of these days David Twohy is going to get it right. This is not that day, but it's reasonably close, as long as you don't mind it when you figure out the ending of a movie before you actually get there. ***",3,"Decent, but the most predictable thriller in years.",1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,3125,"['Perfect', 'Getaway', 'David', 'Twohy', '2009', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'number', 'David', 'Twohy', 'movies', 'point', 'directed', 'just', 'been', 'screenwriter', 'seem', 'be', 'missing', 'something', 'even', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'years', 'example', 'nonexistent', 'character', 'development', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'course', 'more', 'one', 'thing', 'wrong', 'can', 'say', 'Waterworld', 'general', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'decent', 'movies', 'sort', 'standout', 'problem', 'being', 'best', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'technical', 'fault', 'case', 'Twohy', 'finally', 'come', 'close', 'really', 'putting', 'together', 'Perfect', 'Getaway', 'one', 'major', 'failing', 'blew', 'movie', 'me.Plot', 'Cliff', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Cydney', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'recently', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'movies', 'are', 'newlywed', 'couple', 'honeymooning', 'Hawaii', 'newlywed', 'couple', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'murdered', 'Honolulu', 'police', 'according', 'couple', 'hikers', 'meet', 'are', 'looking', 'man', 'woman', 'Which', ""n't"", 'problem', 'keep', 'running', 'Nick', 'Dreamcatcher', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Gina', 'Insanitarium', 'Kiele', 'Sanchez', 'trailer-trash', 'couple', 'who', 'be', 'hiking', 'same', 'otherwise-deserted', 'trail', 'them.The', 'big', 'failing', 'course', 'most', 'people', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'figured', 'out', 'Big', 'Reveal', 'watching', 'trailers', 'reading', 'review', 'know', 'something', 'really', 'really', 'important', ""'m"", 'trying', 'best', 'avoid', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'one', 'scene', 'less', 'halfway', 'movie', 'was', 'shown', 'special', 'movie', 'Current', 'TV', 'network', 'whoops', 'game', 'away', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'when', ""'re"", 'writing', 'suspense', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'idea', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'ending', 'know', 'get', 'ending', 'then', 'can', 'kind', 'understand', 'what', 'Twohy', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'have', 'give', 'respect', 'trying', 'basically', 'riff', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'Profondo', 'Rosso', 'one', 'basically', 'impossible', 'pull', ""'re"", 'Dario', 'Argento', 'Other', 'was', 'pretty', 'intelligent', 'thriller', 'admit', 'had', 'think', 'one', 'scenes', 'while', 'realized', 'was', ""n't"", 'plot', 'hole', 'big', 'enough', 'drive', 'truck', 'competently', 'directed', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'acting', 'especially', 'Jovovich', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'shown', 'much', 'way', 'acting', 'ability', 'gorgeous', 'photography', 'however', 'entirely', 'unglued', 'Big', 'Reveal', 'Perhaps', 'good', 'thing', 'so', 'many', 'figured', 'out', 'so', 'long', 'beforehand', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'already', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'really', 'really', 'confused', 'fragmented', 'incomplete', 'way', 'Big', 'Reveal', 'revealed', 'Big-ly', 'One', 'days', 'David', 'Twohy', 'going', 'get', 'right', 'not', 'day', 'reasonably', 'close', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'when', 'figure', 'out', 'ending', 'movie', 'actually', 'get', 'there', '***']",N/A

She has a particular gift for taking roles that could easily be ""over-acted,"" instead showing a masterful moderation, and gives fairly nuanced performances--even in something like a mediocre rom-com.The plot involves sort of a classic ""who will kill who?"" thriller set on the gorgeous backdrop of Kaua'i, perhaps Hawaii's best kept secret (gorgeous island, much less touristy than Maui or Honolulu, etc.)Like any good thriller there are plenty of twists and a grand twist, but this film never cheapens them.  When it does finally put all of the cards on the table, it does so in a brilliant 20 min. (give or take) sequence that not only makes it credible, but it adds an emotional depth that is succinct, memorable, and dare I say a bit heart-breaking?The main downside is that some of the red-herrings are a bit obvious, but these flaws are mitigated largely by the aforementioned sequence and its careful foreshadowing.

And they DO (try ;o) ). The story seems simple at first: a couple is honeymooning in Hawaii, while news spreads thru the Islands of a brutal murder of another honeymooning couple. The suspected murderers, a man and a woman, are still at large, but likely have not left Hawaii. As our city-dwellers hike thru the Park, alone and out of their element, can they trust the strangers with whom inevitably they cross paths? (OF COURSE, NOT!) And that's when an interesting twist takes this story from predictable to... well... no spoilers here! ;o)I did not have high hopes for this flick...I went to see it mainly because I have a secret crush on Milla Jovovich (if I were a lesbian, Milla and Mariska Hargitay from Law and Order would be my dream dates  ;-P...). Was the film perfect? No. Nonetheless, to my utmost surprise, I enjoyed this thriller far more then I did many supposed ""blockbusters"" this summer. It had some laughs, but was also quite unnerving, tense, and creepy with a light sprinkling of gore: everything a good thriller should have on offer. There were signs from the audience that I was not alone in my enjoyment. However, the film did develop its creep factor slowly. The story needed time before it graduated from ""fluff"" to ""nail biter"". In the end, the super plot twist more then made up for the wait!Two names are worth mentioning (in addition to Jovovich): it was the first time I saw Steve Zahn competently playing a complex ""grown up"" character, a role totally different from the usual ""doofus"" types he seems to favour.

So 45 - 60 minutes into the movie here's what I remember:- Some very bad acting by actors that I really do like. Hey, love 'em or hate 'em, I like theResident Evilmovies and Mila Jovovich is cool. And Timothy Olyphant!...How can you go wrong with him in your film? But they were boring and unbelievable as far as I saw in this movie. And Steve Zahn has got a kind of tough look about him, so seeing him in A Perfect Getaway as a geeky hiker just didn't work; you might say he was...unbelievable, which leads perfectly into,- A story that was seemingly predictable, with people doing stuff that was just hard to swallow. So ultimately by the time I lost consciousness, the movie had introduced me to three couples: Mila and Zahn the hikers, another hiking couple that seems nice and a random couple that you don't trust. It turns out that there's a serial killer(s) on the loose and we're pointed in the direction that the killer may be near and may even be one of the couples.- An hour of the movie has gone by with not much more action than what is contained here in my review. And here are these three couples in a remote area of one of the Hawaiian Islands...When suddenly...I wake up to the main menu of the disk on my screen. Fell asleep, movie ended, credits rolled....Now that's what I call a sleeper.Do I need to give this another chance?

Double entendre aside, A Perfect Getaway does fulfill the suspense promised by the trailer and even throws in a little nastily creative violence, but also sadly offers far too many twists and turns and the much-dreaded flashback - letting the audience know they couldn't have figured it out themselves. It becomes quite obvious early on that things are not what they seem, so attempting to guess the outcome replaces the tension; and oddly intentional screenwriting references spoil several surprises. By the end you should be able to decipher American Jedi from angry hitchhikers, but will you care? It's a credit to David Twohy's directing that you probably will, but the only real getaway is the climax when it perfectly escapes from the credibility of the plot.For their honeymoon, newlyweds Cliff (Steve Zahn) and Cydney (Milla Jovovich) head to the tropical islands of Hawaii. While journeying through the paradisiacal countryside the couple encounters Kale (Chris Hemsworth) and Cleo (Marley Shelton), two mean-spirited hitchhikers and Nick (Timothy Olyphant) and Gina (Kiele Sanchez), two wild but well-meaning spirits who help guide them through the lush jungles. The picturesque waterfalls and scenic mountainsides quickly give way to terror when Cliff and Cydney learn of a grisly murder that occurred nearby and realize that they're being followed by chance acquaintances that suspiciously fit the description of the killers...To say that A Perfect Getaway brings new meaning to the idea of a twist ending would be overly generous. It does indeed keep the audience guessing, but it's more of a twist middle; in an attempt to outsmart the viewer, the film resorts to entirely too much explaining, flashbacks and backstory to educate on details conveniently left out for mystery purposes. It would be more accurate to say that this film is too smart for its own good. Perhaps what is most predictable is the inclusion of twists in the first place, some of which are downright silly. The story doesn't necessarily fall apart because of the unexpected happenings - it fails because of the execution and explanation of the surplusage of red herrings.What works well is the constant comedy. Like most capable suspense films, the anticipation for shocks and instantaneous turns are surrounded by humor. Since Steve Zahn is primarily known for comedies, his casting was an especially competent choice. Jovovich, however, feels consistently inauthentic and her chemistry with Zahn is forced. The foreshadowing is expected and humorous, the misdirection is keen, the scares are a tad gimmicky, the suspense is decent and the movie-within-a-movie side conversations are relatively cheesy. With lines like ""Nothing bad ever happens in Hawaii, right?"" by Zahn and ""He's really hard to kill,"" spoken by the red herring's girlfriend, the barrage of twists is inevitable. It's too bad that most just aren't cleverly introduced or defined.- The Massie Twins",3,A Perfect Getaway Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1249603200,"08 7, 2009",2009,3145,"['When', 'include', 'word', 'perfect', 'movie', 'title', 'leave', 'rather', 'easy', 'target', 'cunning', 'wordsmiths', 'should', 'film', 'not', 'least', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'genre', 'Double', 'entendre', 'aside', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Getaway', 'fulfill', 'suspense', 'promised', 'trailer', 'even', 'throws', 'little', 'nastily', 'creative', 'violence', 'also', 'sadly', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'much-dreaded', 'flashback', 'letting', 'audience', 'know', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'quite', 'obvious', 'early', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'so', 'attempting', 'guess', 'outcome', 'tension', 'oddly', 'intentional', 'screenwriting', 'references', 'spoil', 'several', 'surprises', 'end', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'decipher', 'American', 'Jedi', 'angry', 'hitchhikers', 'will', 'care', 'credit', 'David', 'Twohy', 'directing', 'probably', 'will', 'only', 'real', 'getaway', 'climax', 'when', 'perfectly', 'credibility', 'plot.For', 'honeymoon', 'newlyweds', 'Cliff', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Cydney', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'head', 'tropical', 'islands', 'Hawaii', 'journeying', 'paradisiacal', 'countryside', 'couple', 'encounters', 'Kale', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Cleo', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'two', 'mean-spirited', 'hitchhikers', 'Nick', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Gina', 'Kiele', 'Sanchez', 'two', 'wild', 'well-meaning', 'spirits', 'who', 'help', 'guide', 'lush', 'jungles', 'picturesque', 'waterfalls', 'scenic', 'mountainsides', 'quickly', 'give', 'way', 'terror', 'when', 'Cliff', 'Cydney', 'learn', 'grisly', 'murder', 'occurred', 'nearby', 'realize', ""'re"", 'being', 'followed', 'chance', 'acquaintances', 'suspiciously', 'fit', 'description', 'killers', 'say', 'Perfect', 'Getaway', 'new', 'meaning', 'idea', 'twist', 'ending', 'would', 'be', 'overly', 'generous', 'indeed', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'more', 'twist', 'middle', 'attempt', 'outsmart', 'viewer', 'film', 'resorts', 'entirely', 'too', 'much', 'explaining', 'flashbacks', 'backstory', 'educate', 'details', 'conveniently', 'left', 'out', 'mystery', 'purposes', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'say', 'film', 'too', 'smart', 'own', 'good', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'most', 'predictable', 'inclusion', 'twists', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'downright', 'silly', 'story', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'fall', 'apart', 'unexpected', 'happenings', 'execution', 'explanation', 'surplusage', 'red', 'herrings.What', 'well', 'constant', 'comedy', 'most', 'capable', 'suspense', 'films', 'anticipation', 'shocks', 'instantaneous', 'turns', 'are', 'surrounded', 'humor', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'primarily', 'known', 'comedies', 'casting', 'was', 'especially', 'competent', 'choice', 'Jovovich', 'however', 'feels', 'consistently', 'inauthentic', 'chemistry', 'Zahn', 'forced', 'foreshadowing', 'expected', 'humorous', 'misdirection', 'keen', 'scares', 'are', 'tad', 'gimmicky', 'suspense', 'decent', 'movie-within-a-movie', 'side', 'conversations', 'are', 'relatively', 'cheesy', 'lines', 'Nothing', 'bad', 'ever', 'Hawaii', 'right', 'Zahn', 'really', 'hard', 'kill', 'spoken', 'red', 'herring', 'girlfriend', 'barrage', 'twists', 'inevitable', 'too', 'bad', 'most', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'cleverly', 'introduced', 'defined.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

There have been a couple murders on the main island--- a man and woman are at large. So of course everyone is a suspect, do not trust anyone. Milla and Zahn playing the naive, regular newly weds, Timothy and his g/f playing ""adventurous type"" He has tons of stories and as a viewer you cannot tell if he is embellishing to look cool, or to hide the fact he is the killer, or he really is an interesting guy who just has led an interesting life as a special ops soldier. anyways these four meet and stick together, but wary of each other as more unfolds about the murders. And there's another couple who seem a little rough around the edges, just can't tell if they are the murderers, brings in more intrigue to the movie. I thought the acting was very good, as I said watching Zahn who is known for comedy play a role like this is refreshing.

The film did a pretty good job of setting everything up while not necessarily making you aware of the twist. I suspect the events are mostly consistent, with perhaps a few liberties taken. Anyway it's a great premise to start the movie, it's fun to watch as events unfold, the intrigue and creepy thriller aspects gradually grow darker, the characters are interesting enough, and I thought the twist was about as well executed as could be. Yes you can figure it out if you really try, but unless you've seen spoilers most people will not really be *sure* what's going on for quite some time, even if you have some guesses. Again, I thought it was pretty well done and I usually guess these things way in advance.I thought the end of the movie could have added something more, but overall it was good solid fun and I would watch it again just to see how it looks when you know what's going on from the beginning. [Edit: On further reflection, the ending gets more interesting. When you consider the twist, and some of the things that Steve Zahn's character says near the end (and in previous sequences) it almost seems like some kind of double-twist or reversal of the original twist might have occurred during the ending sequence, if you think about it. Probably not... but I'm not entirely sure without rewatching the whole thing].On the gore level: there is some gore, but it's nothing extreme and is limited to a few scenes. I could have gone without a couple of the scenes but they did kind of set the tone so maybe they were necessary.I can't give it five stars because it's not perfect, but it is very good and I recommend it.",4,Enjoyable adventure / thriller,1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,1758,"['Perfect', 'Getaway', 'enjoyable', 'adventure', 'thriller', 'great', 'setup', 'great', 'twist', 'well', 'set', 'beautiful', 'Hawaii', 'film', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'setting', 'everything', 'up', 'not', 'necessarily', 'making', 'aware', 'twist', 'suspect', 'events', 'are', 'mostly', 'consistent', 'perhaps', 'few', 'liberties', 'taken', 'Anyway', 'great', 'premise', 'start', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'events', 'unfold', 'intrigue', 'creepy', 'thriller', 'aspects', 'gradually', 'grow', 'darker', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough', 'thought', 'twist', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'well', 'executed', 'could', 'be', 'Yes', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'really', 'try', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'spoilers', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'really', 'be', '*sure*', 'what', 'going', 'quite', 'time', 'even', 'have', 'guesses', 'Again', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'usually', 'guess', 'things', 'way', 'advance.I', 'thought', 'end', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'something', 'more', 'overall', 'was', 'good', 'solid', 'fun', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'when', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'beginning', '[', 'Edit', 'further', 'reflection', 'ending', 'more', 'interesting', 'When', 'consider', 'twist', 'things', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'character', 'end', 'previous', 'sequences', 'almost', 'kind', 'double-twist', 'reversal', 'original', 'twist', 'might', 'have', 'occurred', 'ending', 'sequence', 'think', 'Probably', 'not', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'rewatching', 'whole', 'thing', ']', '.On', 'gore', 'level', 'gore', 'nothing', 'extreme', 'limited', 'few', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'couple', 'scenes', 'did', 'kind', 'set', 'tone', 'so', 'maybe', 'were', 'necessary.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'not', 'perfect', 'very', 'good', 'recommend']",N/A

That it did but it wasn't exactly up there with The Sixth Sense. If you pay a Little attention you can figure out that the couple (Mila Jovovich and Steve Zahn) are not the people who they say they are and the moment I saw Steve light a butane burner I knew he was gonna cook some drug cause I have been to Hawaii and I couldn't figure why he was lighting it, I never did anything there that would need that type of burner.The reason why I like this movie so much is for one, the local, Hawaii is so beautiful I was crying having to come back to Vegas (I am man enough to say I cried). I also liked it cause I am the type of guy that when I go places I kind of day dream about some extreme thing happening like serial killers stalking me as displayed in this movie. Of course in my dreams I save the day and everything goes well, same as Timothy Olyphant's character in this movie.O.K. ow that you are totally confused let me tell a bit of the story. Steve and Mila are a couple on their honeymoon going on a hiking trip to a beautiful beach. Along the way they hear about news articles talking about some serial killing couple that has gone to their island.

1289927,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002UJIY70,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","Written and directed by David Twohy (""Pitch Black""), ""A Perfect Getaway"" is, if I may borrow the tagline of the film, about ""6 Strangers. 2 Killers. No Getting Away."" Set in Hawaii (but also shot in Puerto Rico and Jamaica), the film is a perfect example of old-fashioned B-thriller for modern audiences - you know those old black-and-white films about strangers trapped in some isolated place - but whether you like the film or not depends on the extent to which you accept the film's quite ""unique"" solution.The six ""strangers are actually three pairs of lovers: Cliff (Steve Zahn) & Cydney (Milla Jovovich); Nick (Timothy Olyphant) & Gina (Kiele Sanchez); and Kale (Chris Hemsworth) & Cleo (Marley Shelton). The three pairs are in the remote forest and beach in Hawaii, ""the most gorgeous dead end God ever made."" And there was a brutal murder at the hotel in Honolulu and the two suspects, it is reported, are still at large.Without giving too much away, ""A Perfect Getaway"" will keep you guessing, and you will guess wrong. This is not to say David Twohy's script is creative or ingenious. Rather, his often self-conscious screenplay (two characters talk about the writer's job) relies on one idea too much, and this idea is too ambitious to some. Some viewers may guess it right, but even so, most of them would dismiss the idea instantly.And I hear some people complain, saying they are kind of cheated. It is understandable. ""A Perfect Getaway"" needs a tighter and more detailed build-up to the climax. The location is so beautiful, and thanks to the good acting (especially from Timothy Olyphant), suspense is there, but not from the beginning which is a bit too long and dull. Once you know the truths about the characters, the film suddenly becomes a very conventional thriller with familiar plot devices, overacting, and unnecessary violence, the last thing the writer/director wanted this film to be.",3,"B-Thriller That Keeps You Guessing (Not in the Way You Want, Perhaps)",1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,1913,"['Written', 'directed', 'David', 'Twohy', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Perfect', 'Getaway', 'may', 'borrow', 'tagline', 'film', '6', 'Strangers', '2', 'Killers', 'Getting', 'Away', 'Set', 'Hawaii', 'also', 'shot', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'Jamaica', 'film', 'perfect', 'example', 'old-fashioned', 'B-thriller', 'modern', 'audiences', 'know', 'old', 'black-and-white', 'films', 'strangers', 'trapped', 'isolated', 'place', 'film', 'not', 'extent', 'accept', 'film', 'quite', 'unique', 'solution.The', 'six', 'strangers', 'are', 'actually', 'three', 'pairs', 'lovers', 'Cliff', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Cydney', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Nick', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Gina', 'Kiele', 'Sanchez', 'Kale', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Cleo', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'three', 'pairs', 'are', 'remote', 'forest', 'beach', 'Hawaii', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'dead', 'end', 'God', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'brutal', 'murder', 'hotel', 'Honolulu', 'two', 'suspects', 'reported', 'are', 'still', 'large.Without', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'Perfect', 'Getaway', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'will', 'guess', 'wrong', 'not', 'say', 'David', 'Twohy', 'script', 'creative', 'ingenious', 'Rather', 'often', 'self-conscious', 'screenplay', 'two', 'characters', 'talk', 'writer', 'job', 'one', 'idea', 'too', 'much', 'idea', 'too', 'ambitious', 'viewers', 'may', 'guess', 'right', 'even', 'so', 'most', 'would', 'dismiss', 'idea', 'instantly.And', 'hear', 'people', 'complain', 'saying', 'are', 'kind', 'cheated', 'understandable', 'Perfect', 'Getaway', 'tighter', 'more', 'detailed', 'build-up', 'climax', 'location', 'so', 'beautiful', 'thanks', 'good', 'acting', 'especially', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'suspense', 'there', 'not', 'beginning', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'dull', 'Once', 'know', 'truths', 'characters', 'film', 'suddenly', 'very', 'conventional', 'thriller', 'familiar', 'plot', 'devices', 'overacting', 'unnecessary', 'violence', 'last', 'thing', 'writer/director', 'wanted', 'film', 'be']",N/A

I really like Steve Zahn but even he doesnt bring any comic relief to the film, its not necessarily predictable but also you sense whats coming. Making the killers obvious wasn't really something that worked effectively being that they weren't the killers if that makes sense. The whole movie is basically just a meshed together semi-thriller that goes no where but down. On another note, the couple in the movie wed being Newly Weds and traveling the so called trails is very inaccurate, mainly because you don't go on dangerous trails with 1000 drop offs with out a guide or gear. The fact that all the couples in the movie are going the same direction and making camps right near the stormy ocean line isn't very convincing either. There are no rangers, no guides, no signs and really no point to anywhere they are heading. So the killers from the BIG ISLAND as you would call it, end up on the smallest one, by chance? Maybe, maybe not. But when you start to get into the meat and potatoes of the film you really don't even care.

Well, I finally got to catch it on dvd.THE PLOT: Two newlyweds (Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich) set out to enjoy their honeymoon hiking incredibly scenic Kaua'i, Hawaii. Unfortunately they catch word that a crazy murderous couple is on the loose and they become seriously suspicious of other hikers (Timothy Olyphant and Chris Hemsworth, amongst others). Will they escape their honeymoon alive?""A Perfect Getaway"" is worthwhile if, like me, you enjoy island-adventure movies. The film was shot at Kaua'i, Puerto Rico and Jamaica (the sea cave sequence) and these locations are spectacular. Also, the character played by Timothy Olyphant and his babe are likable and you can't help but start to root for them as the story progresses. Chris Hemsworth is also impressive as an ultra-grim/laconic badaxx hiker; keep in mind that he's playing Thor in the upcoming 2011 film of the same name and in ""The Avengers"" in 2012 (and he seems perfect for the role).Everyone knows by now that this is a 'twist' film and consequently the story takes a jarring turn in the final act. Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it. I recommend seeing ""A Perfect Getaway"" if you like island flicks or films with surpising plot twists (or both). See if you can figure out the twist before it happens. (I did and will explain why it was so easy in a moment).Although the film is good for what it is (not great), I'm giving it an overall mediocre rating of 3/5 Stars or grade 'C'. Let me share why I feel this is nothing more than an okay picture. [SPOILER ALERT!! Don't read any further unless you've seen the film or want to know the plot twist!!]We discover in the third act that Zahn & Jovovich are the murderers and that they're actually impostors of a recently murdered newlywed couple. The reason I was able to easily figure this out was that in a murder-twist scenario it's usually the most innocent/vunerable persons who are guilty (e.g. ""Howling V: The Rebirth""). Twist films like this have now become so common that they're no longer even surprising. What would really be refreshing and 'cutting edge' is if the film simply played it straight, i.e. the people we think are the protagonists remain the protagonists throughout and the suspicious/evil people get their comeuppance (""Cape Fear"" is a good example).But why do I give this film a mediocre rating? Because in a way the whole story is a lie -- the very people we come to care about and root for in the first hour end up being despicable criminal scum of the lowest depth (at least Zahn's character anyway) and the suspicious characters that we're led to believe are the murderers end up being the protagonists we should be caring about. To the film's credit we DO end up caring about Olyphant's character and his girl by the end of the story.Yes, I realize that in a way the film isn't lying to the viewer at all and that, once Zahn and Jovovich are understood to be the murderers, all their conversations ARE authentic as the impostors/killers but not as the innocent newlyweds, if you know what I mean. It's all a matter of perspective. But, still, this doesn't take away from that fact that the viewer has essentially been baited and switched -- the very people we think are the innocent/vunerable protagonists end up being the guilty/malevolent scum bags.
