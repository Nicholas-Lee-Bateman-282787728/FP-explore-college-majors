1264214,A1JN63QBBNGB78,B002DU39IK,Amazon Customer,"[2, 3]","I agree with other reviewer comments.  This movie only minutely follows Nora Robert's book of the same title.  The acting was horrible.  Brittany Murphy was clearly a poor choice for the lead female role.  Her attempts to play a romantic heroine was laughable.  Plus, the hairdo she had throughout the film is enough to turn one off.  Was the budget so tight that even a comb would have put the movie over budget?  The guy wasn't much better but at least he didn't consistently overact his role as much as Murphy did.  The movie was also so disjointed that it didn't make a whole lot of sense in numerous places.  Suffice it to say that it was an effort to watch it all the way through.  It was ironic that I had just finished reading the book the same day this movie was shown.  Was totally amazed how the makers of the movie could have put out such a piece of worthless and uninteresting film and used Nora Roberts name as a draw to get it shown during prime time TV.  Wonder if Ms. Roberts has seen this travesty of her book?  This one is a candidate for a ""Razzberry"" award.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.

Being an attractive young girl she soon attracts the attention of a local fantasy magazine writer Ford Sawyer (Jason Lewis).

Soon, Cilla is targeted - newly planted trees get cut down, Steve is attacked, a local man stalks her - and she turns to local detective Alvin Wilson (Mark Wilson) for help. Cilla discovers by reading old letters in the barn that her grandmother, who was a movie star and popular singer, had an affair with a local married man who made her pregnant. She also `visits' Cilla in spirit to watch over and guide her as she explores her past. Her grandmother's `suicide' seems to be more and more unlikely.
