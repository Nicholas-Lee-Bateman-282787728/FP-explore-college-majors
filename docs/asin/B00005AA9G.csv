The story is decent, but it is the acting that makes it worthwhile. Macy plays a complicated man that not only runs an online business, but is a hitman for his father, played by Sutherland, as well. His psychologist, played by Ritter, is understandably upset when Macy first tells him his professions. This isn't Macy's only problems. He seems disturbed over his life and looks for a new relationship with a young lady, played by Campbell. The movie centers on Macy with flashbacks of his youth, and what currently is happening in his life. It comes to a crashing climax when his father tries to bring his son into the business. Well worth a rental which I suggest unless you are already a fan of this cast or this type movie. I went ahead and ordered it since the cast was so good. I don't regret it.

576293,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00005AA9G,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[2, 2]","I discovered this film in my public library.  I've been impressed by  William H. Macy's acting in other films so decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did because this is a hidden gem of a film that deserves a much wider audience that it's received to date. At first this seems similar to the hit tv show &quot;The Sopranos&quot; in its concept and idea with having hitman Macy see a psychiatrist, ably played by John Ritter.  However, Tony Soprano fits into his mobster family's world a lot better than Macy's character Alex does.  Alex exhibits all the classic signs of someone who has been steamrollered into the family business, really doesn't belong there and wants out of it.  His conflict is with his father (Donald Sutherland), mother (Barbara Bain) and himself.  No other mobsters are even used in the film.  Sutherland and Bain are superb as the facade smooth parents who expect and get total devotion to their aims from their son and expect the same generation after generation.  The other main characters, Alex's wife, his girlfriend and his son, serve as contrast to the tension created by this deadly trio.  Alex grabs hold of the three of them, who have no idea of the nature of his &quot;work,&quot; as if they can keep the demons of his parents at bay. Macy gives a very subtly layered and nuanced performance that delivers a very profound look at the dark side of a middle aged man caught between his parents and his own desires.  I haven't seen Neve Campbell in many roles but she shows lots of promise for the future.  Traci Ullman as the wife does not give us her usual comic turn, turning in a solid dramatic performance as the wife instead.

576294,A3IX26GXO7NNTI,B00005AA9G,commontone,"[4, 11]","Before I saw this film, all signs said I would enjoy it.  Its cast includes two of my favorite actors, William H. Macy and Donald Sutherland.  I read boatloads of positive reviews about it, some even calling it one of the year's best films.  I typically avoid mass-produced Hollywood films in favor of little-known sleepers like this one.  And the premise had great potential.Consequently, it was pretty disappointing when halfway through the film I found myself uttering aloud to nobody in particular, ""Wow, this is bad.""After having time to absorb the film, I realize that's not entirely true.  The film isn't that bad.  But I'm still baffled by the praise it's received.The opening scene is promising: Alex (Macy) visits a psychologist for the first time, and when asked what he does for a living, he frankly replies, ""I have two jobs.  I run a mail order business out of my home...and I kill people for a living.""  Alex begins to have doubts about his career, however, when his father Michael (Donald Sutherland), the founder of the ""family business,"" assigns Alex to his next target--his recently acquainted psychologist.You can pretty much guess the path the film takes from there.  Alex is at the perfect age for a midlife crisis.  He wants to quit his job as a hit man but fears his father's reaction.  And he takes a mistress, Sarah (Neve Campbell).  For much of the film, Macy resorts to hanging his head and looking sad, which he does well, but like Hugh Grant's sputtering speech and fluttering eyelids, this fallback device wears thin quickly.  My biggest qualm with his performance is I never believed for a moment that Macy's character was capable of killing anyone.This is surprising, because Sutherland goes to great, indeed excessive, lengths to portray a man who could father a killer.  In flashbacks we see Michael teaching an eight-year-old Alex to kill squirrels with a pistol, and later coaching him through his first ""hit,"" chuckling fondly all along.  In the present, Michael viciously berates Alex's 6-year-old son Sammy for spilling glue, shouting, ""What are you, stupid? A moron? Is there a brain in there?""We're never given any other foundation for this character, and as a result Sutherland's performance is one-dimensional and devoid of any human qualities.  Although it's fun on some level to see him portray an over-the-top maniac, it doesn't lend any credibility to the film.  Alex's mother Diedre, as well, is implausibly unsympathetic.As Sarah, Neve Campbell plays a patient of the same psychology clinic as Alex.  In one of her first scenes she unapologetically explains to her therapist in graphic terms that she's bisexual, and thus we learn from the getgo what a spunky and unconventional character she is.  She spends most of her screen time spouting purposefully quirky lines of dialogue like ""50 minutes is way too little time to fit in a week of tragedies"" (referring to her therapy sessions).  Of course, her unconventional demeanor is attractive to the alienated Alex, who visits her apartment with unclear intentions, wandering around answering ""I dunno"" to her questions and looking oh-so-confused and beleaguered.Sammy is an obnoxiously precocious kindergartner who poses timely questions to his father such as, ""What's infinity, Daddy?""  Ultimately the son's function in the film is to act as the ""last straw"": when Michael takes his grandson out to shoot a squirrel, apparently with the intention of rearing another soldier for the family hit business, Alex has had it, and wants it all to end.With Michael sporadically contributing vignettes of wisdom about ""destiny"" along the way, the result is a lumpy, confused film.The screenplay can't escape it's plot-driven structure by clumsily fleshing out its characters along the way, and for the first time ever, I could *see* Macy and Sutherland *acting.*  The cinematography is elegant and the music is effective (if a bit familiar at times), but ultimately the film can't escape its clunky dialogue, desperate performances and obvious conclusion.  This film should have been better, but unfortunately I can't understand the praise it's received.",2,A surprising disappointment,1026691200,"07 15, 2002",2002,4146,"['saw', 'film', 'signs', 'said', 'would', 'enjoy', 'cast', 'two', 'favorite', 'actors', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'read', 'boatloads', 'positive', 'reviews', 'even', 'calling', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'films', 'typically', 'avoid', 'mass-produced', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'favor', 'little-known', 'sleepers', 'one', 'premise', 'had', 'great', 'potential.Consequently', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointing', 'when', 'halfway', 'film', 'found', 'uttering', 'aloud', 'nobody', 'particular', 'Wow', 'bad', 'having', 'time', 'absorb', 'film', 'realize', 'not', 'entirely', 'true', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', ""'m"", 'still', 'baffled', 'praise', 'received.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'promising', 'Alex', 'Macy', 'psychologist', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'asked', 'what', 'living', 'frankly', 'have', 'two', 'jobs', 'run', 'mail', 'order', 'business', 'home', 'kill', 'people', 'living', 'Alex', 'have', 'doubts', 'career', 'however', 'when', 'father', 'Michael', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'founder', 'family', 'business', 'Alex', 'next', 'target', 'recently', 'acquainted', 'psychologist.You', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'path', 'film', 'there', 'Alex', 'perfect', 'age', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'quit', 'job', 'hit', 'man', 'father', 'reaction', 'mistress', 'Sarah', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'much', 'film', 'Macy', 'hanging', 'head', 'looking', 'sad', 'well', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'sputtering', 'speech', 'fluttering', 'eyelids', 'fallback', 'device', 'wears', 'thin', 'quickly', 'biggest', 'qualm', 'performance', 'never', 'believed', 'moment', 'Macy', 'character', 'was', 'capable', 'killing', 'anyone.This', 'surprising', 'Sutherland', 'great', 'indeed', 'excessive', 'lengths', 'portray', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'father', 'killer', 'flashbacks', 'see', 'Michael', 'teaching', 'eight-year-old', 'Alex', 'kill', 'squirrels', 'pistol', 'later', 'coaching', 'first', 'hit', 'chuckling', 'fondly', 'along', 'present', 'Michael', 'viciously', 'Alex', '6-year-old', 'son', 'Sammy', 'spilling', 'glue', 'shouting', 'What', 'are', 'stupid', 'moron', 'there', 'brain', 'there', ""'re"", 'never', 'given', 'other', 'foundation', 'character', 'result', 'Sutherland', 'performance', 'one-dimensional', 'devoid', 'human', 'qualities', 'fun', 'level', 'see', 'portray', 'over-the-top', 'maniac', ""n't"", 'lend', 'credibility', 'film', 'Alex', 'mother', 'Diedre', 'as', 'well', 'implausibly', 'unsympathetic.As', 'Sarah', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'patient', 'same', 'psychology', 'clinic', 'Alex', 'one', 'first', 'scenes', 'unapologetically', 'therapist', 'graphic', 'terms', 'bisexual', 'thus', 'learn', 'getgo', 'what', 'spunky', 'unconventional', 'character', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'spouting', 'purposefully', 'quirky', 'lines', 'dialogue', '50', 'minutes', 'way', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'fit', 'week', 'tragedies', 'referring', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'course', 'unconventional', 'demeanor', 'attractive', 'alienated', 'Alex', 'who', 'apartment', 'unclear', 'intentions', 'wandering', 'answering', 'dunno', 'questions', 'looking', 'oh-so-confused', 'beleaguered.Sammy', 'obnoxiously', 'precocious', 'kindergartner', 'who', 'timely', 'questions', 'father', 'such', 'What', 'infinity', 'Daddy', 'Ultimately', 'son', 'function', 'film', 'act', 'last', 'straw', 'when', 'Michael', 'grandson', 'shoot', 'squirrel', 'apparently', 'intention', 'rearing', 'soldier', 'family', 'hit', 'business', 'Alex', 'had', 'end.With', 'Michael', 'sporadically', 'contributing', 'vignettes', 'wisdom', 'destiny', 'way', 'result', 'lumpy', 'confused', 'film.The', 'screenplay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'plot-driven', 'structure', 'clumsily', 'fleshing', 'out', 'characters', 'way', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'could', '*see*', 'Macy', 'Sutherland', '*acting', '*', 'cinematography', 'elegant', 'music', 'effective', 'bit', 'familiar', 'times', 'ultimately', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'clunky', 'dialogue', 'desperate', 'performances', 'obvious', 'conclusion', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'praise', 'received']",Panic

They didn't get into the nitty gritty or fully develop Macy and Campbell's relationship as they could have, in my opinion. I also feel like we didn't get as clear of a picture of Macy and Ulman's marriage as we could have. The story spent much more time on Macy's relationships with his son and father.

I think it is one of his finest roles, showcasing his ability to convey emotional complexity without being overly dramatic or over the top. In this film, he plays a hitman who is becoming increasingly tormented by being part of the family business, a business which just happens to be murder for hire, disposing of unwanted people for a hefty fee. The business is headed by Alex's father, played to psychotic perfection by Donald Sutherland, a man who is relentless in his determination to make Alex do his will. Tormented by the idea that his young son might follow his own path, Alex decides to see a psychiatrist (John Ritter). Neve Campbell, cast against type (for those of us who remember her in Scream) does a superb job playing a troubled young woman who encounters Alex in the psychiatrist's waiting room, eventually entering into an affair with him. I won't say more about the major events in this film but hope this brief intro intrigues you enough to want to see it.  Although I plan to watch this one again and again,  I do have to say this might not be for you if you want a movie full of non-stop action, suspense and violence.

Macy to be 'quietly' establishing himself as one of the best actors working today.  He delivers the line quoted above just moments after being confronted by his wife, Martha (Tracy Ullman), about possibly being involved in an affair.  It's a very telling line -- Macy gives it such an air of detached resignation -- it exemplifies the pivotal, life-changing crossroads at which Alex, his character, finds himself.  It's a decision that he has to make -- there is no way to avoid it -- but one that he dreads.  He is a man in a corner with no easy way out.A first directing and writing effort for Henry Bromell, PANIC is a well-composed and intelligent film.  The casting, acting, cinematography and music all combine to create a seeming oxymoron, a sort of 'relaxed tension' that builds as the story progresses.Alex is having a bit of a mid-life crisis -- he's a son dominated by a cold, controlling father (Donald Sutherland), dragged at an early age into following the old man's footsteps into the 'family business', which just happens to be murder-for-hire.  The only other person who knows what the business really involves is his mother (Barbara Bain) -- until the stress and unhappiness of his life bring him into the office of a psycholigist (John Ritter).  In the waiting room he meets fellow patient Sarah (Neve Campbell), a beautiful, troubled 23 year-old woman with issues of her own, to whom he becomes uncontrollably attracted.It is at this point that the viewer begins to realize that this film doesn't take the easy road.  In the hands of another writer or director, everything might become nauseatingly predictable -- but it the case of PANIC, the audience is treated to a more realistic, 'inside' look at a hit man, indeed, a hit man with a conscience.The DVD edition includes a few deleted scenes -- interesting, but just as well left out.  I would go so far as to say that any one of them being included in the finished product might have actually detracted from the overall effect of the film.  Clocking in at only 88 minutes, the film is leaner than many -- but that allows it to move along nicely, to the point, with the fat trimmed away.This film did well at festivals, but didn't fare as well with most critics (Roger Ebert raved about it, however) or in theatres.

I am a huge Neve Campbell fan and jumped at the chance to see something new from her.  I was astonished at how good this movie was.  Don't get me wrong, I love Neve's other movies, but they appeal to the senses in a much more shallow, and immediate pleasure-type way.  This movie seemed extremely deep compared to her role in WILD THINGS and the SCREAM films (which I still LOVE).  PANIC is the story of Alex who is tired of his job of killing people so he decides to see a shrink.  In the waiting room, he meets a friendly, neurotic young woman, Sarah, played with perfection by Neve Campbell.  Alex immediatley takes to Sarah and her antics and begins to slowly get involved with her, easing his way into an affair.  The film brilliantly interweaves the story of Alex's past, his future, his struggles with his family (his father, who forced him into the &quot;family business&quot; of murder-for-hire, his mother who quietly supports her husband's decisions, his wife, who feels distanced and bitter towards Alex, and most importantly, his son, who is just beginning to understand how the world works), his torrid affair with Sarah, and the relashionship (which quickly becomes deadly) with his therapist.  The movie does not use special effects to dazzle the eye or even complex camera shots.  The entire movie gives a sort of tense vibe, which really contributes to all of the story lines.  The last ten minutes are honestly the most haunting and compelling I have seen in recent films.  Every actor submits themselves to their role and becomes their character and I honestly believe what they say.  Sammie, the six year old son of Alex, provides the comic relief (the scene at the table where he talks about going into the army is hilarious) but at the same time instills the fear that history will repeat itself, and he too will fall prey to Alex's father.

Of the several hundred films that get a theatrical release every year, perhaps just one in three makes a profit. Many hundreds more don't get released at all, although some of these are lucky enough to go direct to video. I love to alert people to great but overlooked movies, and Panic is one of them.Alex [William H. Macy] is having a mid-life crisis. Without telling his friends or family, he goes to a psychologist for help. When the doctor asks him what he does for a living, Alex replies that he has two jobs. He has a mail order business, and he works for his father. When the shrink asks what he does for Dad, he says that he kills people. Yes, dear old Dad runs a hit man service. And Alex wonders why he feels empty inside! Meanwhile, in the doctor's waiting room, he meets Sarah [Neve Campbell], a strange, desolate and beautiful girl who makes Alex feel alive for the first time in a months. How will Alex solve his crisis? What role will the girl play? Will his wife find out his true profession? Can his twisted father persuade him to go through with the next hit?What a dumb plot, some of you are thinking, and in lesser hands, it would be. Director and writer Henry Bromell cleverly gives the tale richness and depth. There are several layers to it. Alex may be a bad man in many ways, but loves his wife and his relationship with his young son, played by the extraordinary David Dorfman, is caring and genuine. Their scenes together are poignant and memorable. I suspect that the story is meant to be allegorical. The hit man theme is there to show the extraordinary lengths a sons can go to please his father, no matter how cruel and ruthless that father might be. Even the most dysfunctional family can have unbreakable bonds and twisted loyalties.Panic is greatly helped by its fine cast. I doubt William H. Macy is capable of a bad performance. The often underrated Neve Campbell gives substance to a character who would be a joke in the hands of a lesser actress. Donald Sutherland is one of my favorites and is perfect here. No one can make a smile look as menacing as he can. Tracy Ullman is believable as Alex's ernest but insecure wife.Panic was well received by critics and audiences at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival. Later, at a test screening, the audience did not like the ending, so the distributor got cold feet and shelved it. Such is the logic of Hollywood.",4,"Decidedly different, definately dark.

This movie is a  true  classic.Macy has a wife(tracy ullman) and a sort of weird kid(kid from many scary movies, just can't remember).  The kid may be my favorite character.Macy's dad(donald sutherland) is a hitman also and got his son into the biz.  His son doesn't want to be a hitman anymore and starts talking to a psychiatrist(john ritter).Now I know that you are saying, this looks weird, it has TRACY ULLMAN as macy's wife, but it works, I never knew how great of an actress she was.  She's better than when I was left speechless by marlon wayan's performance as a serious actor in requiem for a dream.  Donald sutherland is great, and just like ullman and macy, I think that this is John Ritter's best ever performace.  I'm being serious.Whoever made this movie is EXTREMELY creative by using all of these actors to play roles they have never doen before, brilliant but who  else would have thought of it.

He will confront his father and put a stop to this horrible business. And why does Alex have to support his mother and father through this killing business? It is lucrative enough, so that dad tells Alex he will buy his wife a new Lexus and a vacation after the job is done. Just what kind of family is this? How did Alex such a wonderful man with a conscience, it seems, come to this family? What genetic characteristic is going to help him be finished, kaput, done, fini with the killing job?

576317,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005AA9G,Reviewer,"[9, 9]","The effects of job related stress and the pressures born of a moral dilemma that pits conscience against the obligations of a family business (albeit a unique one) all brought to a head by-- or perhaps the catalyst of-- a midlife crisis, are examined in the dark and absorbing drama, ""Panic,"" written and directed by Henry Bromell, and starring William H. Macy and Donald Sutherland.  It's a telling look at how indecision and denial can bring about the internal strife and misery that ultimately leads to apathy and that moment of truth when the conflict must, of necessity, at last be resolved.Alex (Macy) is tired; he has a loving wife, Martha (Tracey Ullman), a precocious six-year-old son, Sammy (David Dorfman), a mail order business he runs out of the house, as well as his main source of income, the ""family"" business he shares with his father, Michael (Sutherland), and his mother, Deidre (Barbara Bain).  But he's empty; years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached, putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist, Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter).  And to make matters worse (or maybe better, depending upon perspective), in Dr. Parks' waiting room he meets a young woman, Sarah Cassidy (Neve Campbell), whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember.  She quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him, as in the days after their meeting he simply cannot stop thinking about her.  His whole life, it seems, has become a ""situation""-- one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves.  He can deny his age and the fact that he has, indeed, slipped into a genuine midlife crisis, but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own.  He's at a crossroads, and he's going to have to decide which way to go.  And he's going to have to do it very soon.From a concept that is intrinsically interesting, Bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive, and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what Alex is going through.  He makes it very clear that there are no simple answers, that in real life there is no easy way out.  His characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and, moreover, within any given family unit.  The film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny, with irrevocable consequences and effects.  When you're growing up, you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large; and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet, and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son.  And it is at that point that Alex finds himself as the story unfolds; ergo, the midlife crisis, or more specifically, the crisis of conscience from which he cannot escape.  It's a powerful message, succinctly and subtly conveyed by Bromell, with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors.For some time, William H. Macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business, creating such diverse characters as Quiz Kid Donnie Smith in ""Magnolia,"" The Shoveler in ""Mystery Men"" and Jerry Lundegaard in ""Fargo.""  And that's just a sampling of his many achievements.  At one point in this film, Sarah mentions Alex's ""sad eyes,"" and it's a very telling comment, as therein lies the strength of Macy's performance here, his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated, believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing.  Consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed, staring off into the darkness; in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling, not only with his immediate situation, but with everything in his life that has brought him, finally, to this point.  In that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt, confusion and uncertainty, all of which have been successfully suppressed until now; all the things that have always been at the core of Alex's life, only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing, demanding confrontation and resolution.  It's a complex character created and delivered by Macy with an absolute precision that makes Alex truly memorable.  It's a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate.  It's a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around.Sutherland is extremely effective, as well; his Michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real it's chilling.  It's frightening, in fact, to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth.  This is not some pulp fiction or James Bond type villain, but a true personification of evil, hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door, which is what makes it all the more disconcerting.  And Sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly, with a great performance.Neve Campbell looks the part of Sarah, but her performance (as is the usual case with her) seems somewhat pretentious, although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film.  If only she would occasionally turn her energies inward, it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters.  ""Panic,"" however, is one of her best efforts; a powerful film that, in the end, is a journey well worth taking.",4,At What Age Is A Crisis Due?,1014681600,"02 26, 2002",2002,5808,"['effects', 'job',

He's not a very happy man despite a loving wife and a young child, and seeks the attention of a young woman whom he met a as a fellow patient at the therapist office...Things get heated when he finds out his next job is to kill the therapist or his father will expose his secret life and destroy his marriage.This is a very good film. Not such much action, but a good script that stays away from cliches and cheesy lines. The acting is top notch other than Neve Campbell who never really makes her presence felt.

576320,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005AA9G,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 6]","The ""banality of evil"" has long been a source of fascination for those artists exploring the dark side of human nature.  Gloomy houses filled with vengeful spirits or twitching psychos hold less fear for the common man than the sudden discovery that the ""people next door,"" the PTA member down the street, or the social director for the local church youth group are the true villains who surround us unnoticed, people whose very ""normalcy"" serves to mask the evil within.  For only when the mask is finally ripped off and we at last get to see what we have been living next to all along do we come to realize how very tenuous is our security and safety in this world.  What could be scarier than that?In this category of works, ""Panic"" emerges as a genuinely chilling, emotionally unsettling psychological thriller, short on gratuitous violence and long on characterization and mood.  Writer/director Henry Bromell has fashioned a dark, disturbing tale of a man named Alex (William H. Macy) who seeks the professional help of a therapist played by John Ritter.  Alex's problem is a decidedly unique one:  it seems that, since he's been a teen, he has served as hit man for his father (Donald Sutherland) whose mysterious, shady ""business"" apparently calls for the elimination of certain parties at the request of unknown ""clients.""  Alex is a seemingly good man, devoted to his wife and son, who has somehow found a way to distance himself emotionally and morally from the heinous crimes he commits.  Yet, obviously, Alex has arrived at a point of moral reckoning - for how else to explain his sudden need to unburden himself to this total stranger?  Macy gives a brilliant performance as Alex, showing, in his totally understated reactions to the people and events around him, what it is like to be buttoned up so tight that even with all the mayhem and filial abuse he's experienced in his life he is able to truthfully say ""I don't know if I've ever been angry"" - even at his father who got him into this life in the first place.What makes ""Panic"" so unsettling is that it violates all our comforting notions about the ties that bind father to son and family members to each other.  Rather than setting a fine moral example for their child, both of Alex's parents, Michael (Donald Sutherland) and Deidre (Barbara Bain), have actually groomed him to become a cold-blooded killer.  Yet, life seems to go on in surface ease within the confines of not only that family but Alex's own family as well.  Alex keeps the truth hidden from both his wife, Martha (Tracy Ullman) and his 6-year old son, Sammy (David Dorfman), allowing them to function almost as any other normal suburban family.Yet, Alex has other, perhaps more mundane problems as well.  He meets a somewhat disturbed 23-year old fellow patient named Sarah (Neve Campbell) to whom he feels an immediate attraction.  Tentatively, these two lost souls grope towards each other, both of them hoping to find in the other that which is lacking in themselves.  But in many ways, Alex is actually a man of strong moral character in certain aspects of his life and he agonizes over taking the initial step towards consummating their relationship, knowing it will harm the wife he loves but no longer feels attracted to.  Bromell's sophisticated screenplay refuses to spell out every psychological detail for the audience, allowing us to make our own connections, draw our own conclusions and reach our own moral judgments.  As director as well, Bromell establishes and maintains a mood of almost heartbreaking melancholy and sadness.  Characters rarely speak above a hush; the camera glides slowly along taking in the scene at a leisurely, unhurried pace; and the haunting musical score heightens the strange unreality of the world which these people have come to inhabit, a world that seems to call into question everything we take for granted in the area of morality, ethics and basic common decency.The performances from every member of the cast (right on down to little David Dorfman) are letter perfect.  Each of these fine actors knows exactly the right note to hit in every scene, never cutting against the grain of understated seriousness that Bromell has established.""Panic"" is a small, underrated gem that lingers long in one's memory.",4,genuinely chilling thriller,1011916800,"01 25, 2002",2002,4296,"['banality', 'evil', 'long', 'been', 'source', 'fascination', 'artists', 'exploring', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'Gloomy', 'houses', 'filled', 'vengeful', 'spirits', 'twitching', 'psychos', 'hold', 'less', 'fear', 'common', 'man', 'sudden', 'discovery', 'people', 'door', 'PTA', 'member', 'down', 'street', 'social', 'director', 'local', 'church', 'youth', 'group', 'are', 'true', 'villains', 'who', 'surround', 'unnoticed', 'people', 'very', 'normalcy', 'serves', 'mask', 'evil', 'only', 'when', 'mask', 'finally', 'ripped', 'off', 'last', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'next', 'along', 'do', 'come', 'realize', 'how', 'very', 'tenuous', 'security', 'safety', 'world', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'scarier', 'category', 'works', 'Panic', 'genuinely', 'chilling', 'emotionally', 'unsettling', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'short', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'long', 'characterization', 'mood', 'Writer/director', 'Henry', 'Bromell', 'fashioned', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'tale', 'man', 'named', 'Alex', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'who', 'professional', 'help', 'therapist', 'played', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Alex', 'problem', 'decidedly', 'unique', 'one', 'been', 'teen', 'served', 'hit', 'man', 'father', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'mysterious', 'shady', 'business', 'apparently', 'elimination', 'certain', 'parties', 'request', 'unknown', 'clients', 'Alex', 'seemingly', 'good', 'man', 'devoted', 'wife', 'son', 'who', 'somehow', 'found', 'way', 'distance', 'emotionally', 'morally', 'heinous', 'crimes', 'obviously', 'Alex', 'arrived', 'point', 'moral', 'reckoning', 'how', 'else', 'explain', 'sudden', 'need', 'unburden', 'total', 'stranger', 'Macy', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Alex', 'showing', 'totally', 'understated', 'reactions', 'people', 'events', 'what', 'be', 'buttoned', 'up', 'so', 'tight', 'even', 'mayhem', 'filial', 'abuse', 'experienced', 'life', 'able', 'truthfully', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'angry', 'even', 'father', 'who', 'got', 'life', 'first', 'place.What', 'Panic', 'unsettling', 'comforting', 'notions', 'ties', 'bind', 'father', 'son', 'family', 'members', 'other', 'Rather', 'setting', 'fine', 'moral', 'example', 'child', 'Alex', 'parents', 'Michael', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Deidre', 'Barbara', 'Bain', 'have', 'actually', 'groomed', 'become', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'life', 'go', 'surface', 'ease', 'confines', 'not', 'only', 'family', 'Alex', 'own', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'Alex', 'truth', 'hidden', 'wife', 'Martha', 'Tracy', 'Ullman', '6-year', 'old', 'son', 'Sammy', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'allowing', 'function', 'almost', 'other', 'normal', 'suburban', 'family.Yet', 'Alex', 'other', 'perhaps', 'more', 'mundane', 'problems', 'as', 'well', 'somewhat', 'disturbed', '23-year', 'old', 'fellow', 'patient', 'named', 'Sarah', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'whom', 'immediate', 'attraction', 'Tentatively', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'grope', 'other', 'hoping', 'find', 'other', 'lacking', 'many', 'ways', 'Alex', 'actually', 'man', 'strong', 'moral', 'character', 'certain', 'aspects', 'life', 'taking', 'initial', 'step', 'towards', 'consummating', 'relationship', 'knowing', 'will', 'harm', 'wife', 'longer', 'feels', 'attracted', 'Bromell', 'sophisticated', 'screenplay', 'spell', 'out', 'psychological', 'detail', 'audience', 'allowing', 'make', 'own', 'connections', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'reach', 'own', 'moral', 'judgments', 'As', 'director', 'well', 'Bromell', 'establishes', 'mood', 'almost', 'heartbreaking', 'melancholy', 'sadness', 'Characters', 'rarely', 'speak', 'hush', 'camera', 'slowly', 'along', 'taking', 'scene', 'leisurely', 'unhurried', 'pace', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'strange', 'unreality', 'world', 'people', 'have', 'come', 'inhabit', 'world', 'call', 'question', 'everything', 'take', 'granted', 'area', 'morality', 'ethics', 'basic', 'common', 'decency.The', 'performances', 'member', 'cast', 'right', 'little', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'are', 'letter', 'perfect', 'fine', 'actors', 'exactly', 'right', 'note', 'hit', 'scene', 'never', 'cutting', 'grain', 'understated', 'seriousness', 'Bromell', 'established', 'Panic', 'small', 'underrated', 'gem', 'lingers', 'long', 'one', 'memory']",Panic

This time he is the junior partner in a father/son murder-for hire business (father is done well by the remotely creepy Donald Sutherland).At mid-life, Macy's character decides he doesn't want to do it anymore, and seeks professional counseling.  The psychologist turns out to be played by John Ritter, who turns in a fine performance.  He is very likeable, and I really enjoyed seeing him in what must have been one of his last roles.Along the way, Macy becomes romantically involves with another psych patient 1/2 his age - the superbly lovely Neve Campbell.  The plot thickens further when grandpa Sutherland starts grooming Macy's little boy for the family business.  And Macy gets a very difficult hit assignment.The scriptwriting could have been a bit better.  The time jumps confused me now and then (and you can't make Sutherland, or Macy, look 28 anymore).
