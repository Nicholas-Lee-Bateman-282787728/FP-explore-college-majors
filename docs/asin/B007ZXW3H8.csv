1540128,A3PXY2C0L3KLK,B007ZXW3H8,&#10023; St. Winter &#10023;,"[10, 10]","""Dora's Fantastic Gymnastics Adventure"" contains three episodes from the seventh season of the long-running Nick Jr. program. The titular episode features Dora as a gymnast, whose purpose is to perform gymnastics while spiraling a rainbow ribbon. Unfortunately her rainbow ribbon gets lost (you can probably guess why). Throughout their journey, the song ""Fantastic Gymnastics"" is sung repeatedly, and it is quite catchy. This episode teaches the important of physical fitness, and that engaging in physical activities is not only beneficial, but can be fun!The second episode is a western-inspired ""A Ribbon for Pinto"". It features Dora having to travel across the desert to deliver ribbons for a pony show. And incidentally, her pony Pinto is to compete in this show. This episode teaches organization and counting while at Benny's sheep barn! The episode's climax features a classical western-style chase down, against a certain swiping fox. At the end of the episode, a lesson is repeated about the important of 'earning your prize'.And lastly, the final episode is ""Swiper's Favorite Things"". My favorite of the episodes on this DVD, begins with Dora and Boots having a sleepover. Their fun is interrupted when they see that Swiper is caught up in a windstorm, and  all his special things for his sleepover at Granny Fox's are missing! Dora and Boots agree to help Swiper, and along the way teach Swiper the important of keeping a promise, and self control.Altogether, there is a lot that either you or your special youngster could learn from this great Dora DVD.",4,"Three adventures, a lot of ribbons, and some lessons",1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,1568,"['Dora', 'Fantastic', 'Gymnastics', 'Adventure', 'contains', 'three', 'episodes', 'seventh', 'season', 'long-running', 'Nick', 'Jr.', 'program', 'titular', 'episode', 'features', 'Dora', 'gymnast', 'purpose', 'perform', 'gymnastics', 'spiraling', 'rainbow', 'ribbon', 'Unfortunately', 'rainbow', 'ribbon', 'lost', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'why', 'journey', 'song', 'Fantastic', 'Gymnastics', 'sung', 'repeatedly', 'quite', 'catchy', 'episode', 'important', 'physical', 'fitness', 'engaging', 'physical', 'activities', 'not', 'only', 'beneficial', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'second', 'episode', 'western-inspired', 'A', 'Ribbon', 'Pinto', 'Dora', 'having', 'travel', 'desert', 'deliver', 'ribbons', 'pony', 'show', 'incidentally', 'pony', 'Pinto', 'compete', 'show', 'episode', 'organization', 'counting', 'while', 'Benny', 'sheep', 'barn', 'episode', 'climax', 'classical', 'western-style', 'chase', 'down', 'certain', 'swiping', 'fox', 'end', 'episode', 'lesson', 'repeated', 'important', ""'earning"", ""prize'.And"", 'lastly', 'final', 'episode', 'Swiper', 'Favorite', 'Things', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'Dora', 'Boots', 'having', 'sleepover', 'fun', 'interrupted', 'when', 'see', 'Swiper', 'caught', 'up', 'windstorm', 'special', 'things', 'sleepover', 'Granny', 'Fox', 'are', 'missing', 'Dora', 'Boots', 'agree', 'help', 'Swiper', 'way', 'teach', 'important', 'keeping', 'promise', 'control.Altogether', 'lot', 'special', 'youngster', 'could', 'learn', 'great', 'Dora', 'DVD']",N/A

However, when I purchased it I thought it was a movie, not 4 episodes. That is my only complaint. I wish it were a movie, not just a few episodes, 3 of which have nothing to do with Gymnastics.

The girls next door are in gymnastics and my boys were curious about why the girls were wearing ""bathing suits"" (leotards.)  They loved watching the three episodes on this disc, over and over of course!  The first is the gymnastic one where Dora twirls around a ribbon and of course includes an adventure including Swiper.  My boys especially love Swiper because he is sneaky and mischievous.  The other two episodes are classic Dora and friends.  I love Dora in general because it gets my boys up and moving, they talk to Dora and learn all sorts of new things.
