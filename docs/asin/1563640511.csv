The story is a sad one as he didn't get the support from the royalty that Luther did and his end is tragic.  The film is told mainly through flashbacks as it opens with John Hus being put in his cell and being informed on how to keep the rats away by snoring loudly.  If you have seen ""Luther"" with Joseph Feinnes, this movie will seem a little duller by comparison.  As it isn't an action based movie, but rather more dialogue based.  So it does require a little bit more concentration than most ADHD viewers of today are used to doing.  However, the acting is very convincing and natural.  The actor portraying John Hus does an excellent job of coming across as a sincere and nice man.  Which makes one feel for him when he is burned at the stake.  All in all, I do consider it a five star film.  And the history is definitely worth learning.",5,Good Acting and Well Done.,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,919,"['biopic', 'John', 'Hus', 'sort', 'Pre-Luther', 'Luther', 'will', 'story', 'sad', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'support', 'royalty', 'Luther', 'did', 'end', 'tragic', 'film', 'told', 'mainly', 'through', 'flashbacks', 'John', 'Hus', 'being', 'put', 'cell', 'being', 'informed', 'how', 'keep', 'rats', 'away', 'snoring', 'loudly', 'have', 'seen', 'Luther', 'Joseph', 'Feinnes', 'movie', 'will', 'seem', 'little', 'duller', 'comparison', ""n't"", 'action', 'based', 'movie', 'rather', 'more', 'dialogue', 'based', 'require', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'concentration', 'most', 'ADHD', 'viewers', 'today', 'are', 'used', 'doing', 'However', 'acting', 'very', 'convincing', 'natural', 'actor', 'portraying', 'John', 'Hus', 'excellent', 'job', 'coming', 'sincere', 'nice', 'man', 'one', 'feel', 'when', 'burned', 'stake', 'do', 'consider', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'history', 'definitely', 'worth', 'learning']",N/A

It was copied over from film (VHS or otherwise) so the quality is a little inferior but definitely not poor.

183482,A3P2ROVW7YWQGJ,1563640511,Encompassed Runner,"[47, 50]","John (Jan) Hus challenged the Roman Catholic Church arguing that the Bible is the final authority in matters of doctrine and that Christ, not the pope, is head of the church.  Most importantly, Hus preached that salvation was by faith alone, a gift that in no way could be bought, worked for, or earned.  Hus was martyred after being betrayed by the Holy Roman Emperor, who went back on his promise to Hus of safe passage to the Council of Constance.It would seem that Hus' story would be exciting, but this movie, a historical drama rather than a documentary, is rather bland actually, only very superficially telling us of Hus, not mentioning much about his following Wycliffe's teachings nor telling us anything of his personal life and relations that might draw us more into his character.  The acting and production is not as good as most other Reformation or Pre-Reformation films I've seen; however, this is the only movie on John Hus that I'm aware of (not to say there aren't others), so I'm grateful for it being out there.",3,"Just Okay, But At Least Gets the Hus Story Out...",1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,1033,"['John', 'Jan', 'Hus', 'challenged', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'arguing', 'Bible', 'final', 'authority', 'matters', 'doctrine', 'Christ', 'not', 'pope', 'head', 'church', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Hus', 'preached', 'salvation', 'was', 'faith', 'alone', 'gift', 'way', 'could', 'be', 'bought', 'worked', 'earned', 'Hus', 'was', 'martyred', 'being', 'betrayed', 'Holy', 'Roman', 'Emperor', 'who', 'went', 'back', 'promise', 'Hus', 'safe', 'passage', 'Council', 'Constance.It', 'would', 'seem', 'Hus', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'exciting', 'movie', 'historical', 'drama', 'rather', 'documentary', 'rather', 'bland', 'actually', 'only', 'very', 'superficially', 'telling', 'Hus', 'not', 'mentioning', 'much', 'following', 'Wycliffe', 'teachings', 'telling', 'anything', 'personal', 'life', 'relations', 'might', 'draw', 'more', 'character', 'acting', 'production', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'most', 'other', 'Reformation', 'Pre-Reformation', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'however', 'only', 'movie', 'John', 'Hus', ""'m"", 'aware', 'not', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'others', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'being', 'out', 'there']",N/A

He sang hyms as he was put to death. He was burned at the stake for heresy against the doctrines of Church of that day. Like Luther, his main contentions were indulgencies (purchasing salvation) and that the scriptures were to be held higher than man made doctrines.This film is very enlightening, but rather short - only 55 minutes. However, in the bonus section there is a documentary that gives even futher insight into the life of John Hus.The acting is quite acceptable, and the costumes are excellent. The sets are also excellent apart from a couple of scenes where the background is totally black (for this I gave a rating of 4 and not 5 stars).I would recommend this film to anyone with a keen interest in Church history and the development of the Protestant Reformation.",4,Important Church History,1295481600,"01 20, 2011",2011,902,"['John', 'Hus', 'preceded', 'Martin', 'Luther', '100', 'years', 'yet', 'so', 'few', 'people', 'know', 'life', 'came', 'end', 'July', '6', '1415', 'sang', 'hyms', 'was', 'put', 'death', 'was', 'burned', 'stake', 'heresy', 'doctrines', 'Church', 'day', 'Luther', 'main', 'contentions', 'were', 'indulgencies', 'purchasing', 'salvation', 'scriptures', 'were', 'be', 'held', 'higher', 'man', 'made', 'doctrines.This', 'film', 'very', 'enlightening', 'rather', 'short', 'only', '55', 'minutes', 'However', 'bonus', 'section', 'documentary', 'even', 'futher', 'insight', 'life', 'John', 'Hus.The', 'acting', 'quite', 'acceptable', 'costumes', 'are', 'excellent', 'sets', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'apart', 'couple', 'scenes', 'where', 'background', 'totally', 'black', 'gave', 'rating', '4', 'not', '5', 'stars', '.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'keen', 'interest', 'Church', 'history', 'development', 'Protestant', 'Reformation']",N/A
