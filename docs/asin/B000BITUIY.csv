How depressing.I've seen Ken Burns's ""Civil War"" masterpiece and know that it deals unflinchingly with a war that cost over 600,000 lives and involved untold destruction.Yet somehow I find his ""Shakers"" much more depressing.  I don't know if it's the sad music, the countless shots of abandoned buildings, or the lonely look of the furniture, but every time I see this I feel like I'm the last person on earth and all the cheer and industry of the human race is a thing of the distant, unrecoverable past.",4,hide the straight razors before viewing,1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,513,"['Yeesh', 'How', 'depressing.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Civil', 'War', 'masterpiece', 'know', 'unflinchingly', 'war', 'cost', '600,000', 'lives', 'involved', 'untold', 'destruction.Yet', 'somehow', 'find', 'Shakers', 'much', 'more', 'depressing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sad', 'music', 'countless', 'shots', 'abandoned', 'buildings', 'lonely', 'look', 'furniture', 'time', 'see', 'feel', ""'m"", 'last', 'person', 'earth', 'cheer', 'industry', 'human', 'race', 'thing', 'distant', 'unrecoverable', 'past']",N/A

This excellent Ken Burns film describes the Shakers, a radical sect of Protestants led by the founder Mother Ann Lee.The sect had peculiar beliefs, especially a prohibition on sex so consequently, it died out.  When this movie was made the last Shakers were around.  They consisted of old, very old, women.  One was dumped on the Shakers by her step-mother when her father re-married.The history of the Shakers is in many ways the story of American dynamism captured and crystallized by this tiny sect of fanatics.  They produce great things, rise to great wealth, and do things with an eye on perfection.This movie very ably tells the story of this basically extinct faith.",5,The Last Poem Before Extinction,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,846,"['When', 'explaining', 'America', 'European', 'important', 'start', 'off', 'fact', 'American', 'culture', 'fundamentally', 'pre-Enlightenment', 'Radical', 'Protestants', 'excellent', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'film', 'Shakers', 'radical', 'sect', 'Protestants', 'led', 'founder', 'Mother', 'Ann', 'Lee.The', 'sect', 'had', 'peculiar', 'beliefs', 'especially', 'prohibition', 'sex', 'so', 'consequently', 'died', 'out', 'When', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'last', 'Shakers', 'were', 'around', 'consisted', 'old', 'very', 'old', 'women', 'One', 'was', 'dumped', 'Shakers', 'step-mother', 'when', 'father', 're-married.The', 'history', 'Shakers', 'many', 'ways', 'story', 'American', 'dynamism', 'captured', 'crystallized', 'tiny', 'sect', 'fanatics', 'produce', 'great', 'things', 'rise', 'great', 'wealth', 'do', 'things', 'eye', 'perfection.This', 'movie', 'very', 'ably', 'story', 'basically', 'extinct', 'faith']",N/A

The story of the Shakers has many of Burns' trade-marks; vintage period music, first person interviews, and his panning shots of old photographs. However, ""Shakers"" is missing the charm of later biographies such asBaseball - A Film By Ken Burns,The Civil War - A Film by Ken BurnsandJazz : A Film By Ken Burnswhich makes it less interesting and more difficult to get completely emerged in the story.The story of the Shakers is interesting and Ken Burns documentary is a nice introduction to a group that is largely forgotten in today's society. Burns shows how the Shaker society experienced explosive growth in popularity and in clout. Less time is spent of the slow decline of their culture, and in fact, there were only about a dozen practicing Shakers when Burns was working on the documentary.Final Verdict- A bit dull at times and certainly one of Burns' earlier works, but an early documentary by Ken Burns is still better than 80% of the rest-of-the-pack.3 1/2 stars",4,Clearly an Early Burns Documentary,1248566400,"07 26, 2009",2009,1116,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'more', 'famous', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'greatest', 'biographer', 'generation', 'truth', 'may', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'best', 'all-time', 'story', 'Shakers', 'many', 'Burns', 'trade-marks', 'vintage', 'period', 'music', 'first', 'person', 'interviews', 'panning', 'shots', 'old', 'photographs', 'However', 'Shakers', 'missing', 'charm', 'later', 'biographies', 'such', 'asBaseball', 'Film', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Civil', 'War', 'Film', 'Ken', 'BurnsandJazz', 'Film', 'Ken', 'Burnswhich', 'less', 'interesting', 'more', 'difficult', 'get', 'completely', 'emerged', 'story.The', 'story', 'Shakers', 'interesting', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'documentary', 'nice', 'introduction', 'group', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'today', 'society', 'Burns', 'how', 'Shaker', 'society', 'experienced', 'explosive', 'growth', 'popularity', 'clout', 'Less', 'time', 'spent', 'slow', 'decline', 'culture', 'fact', 'were', 'only', 'dozen', 'practicing', 'Shakers', 'when', 'Burns', 'was', 'working', 'documentary.Final', 'Verdict-', 'A', 'bit', 'dull', 'times', 'certainly', 'one', 'Burns', 'earlier', 'works', 'early', 'documentary', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'still', 'better', '80', '%', 'rest-of-the-pack.3', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

There are beautiful scenes of the communities and the buildings and the scenes where the remaining living Shakers talk and sing and dance are great.  The scenes very much give you a feel for the simple sincerity of their beliefs.  The black and white pictures of Shakers through history are also wonderful.However, this is a VERY basic introduction to this Christian religious movement from the 1700's that was founded by Mother Ann (Ann Lee) when she came over from England to America.  Much is glossed over and this documentary could have been longer because it felt rushed at times.  There were hints about how the Shakers fit into the upsurge of strong religious faith in this period of American history (1800's) and their influence on the country, but more info would have been nice.The dancing and singing were touched upon, but was not placed within a deeper context of such acts of faith.  The origins of the Shakers beyond Mother Ann were also not really brought up...the French female prophets played a strong part in how the Quakers and Shakers got started, but they weren't really mentioned.  The documentary also didn't go very deeply into why this religion had such strong female roles, especially in a time when that was not generally accepted.This isn't to say that I didn't enjoy the program, only that it could have been even better.  Ken Burn's later documentaries are much more thorough, such as his Prohibition, The War, and his Civil War one.  Perhaps, he could someday go back and re-visit The Shakers and expand upon it.

Launay,"[3, 3]","I don't think anyone can really experience the Shakers' purity of religious vision without actually walking through one of their (preserved) villages - in New England or Kentucky. The perfection and simplicity offered to God can then be felt by our senses in three dimensions. And it is unforgettable.Perhaps the next best thing is obtaining this documentary. A great scientist once said that ""simplicity is the greatest sophistication."" That idea is expressed...in Shaker furniture and designs and architecture. These are well photographed in the documentary. In attending a museum exhibition on American arts and crafts furniture, it occurred to me that the simplicity of line in ""arts and crafts"" in America versus Europe may have been derived from Shaker ideas.True..the requirement of celibacy for ""all members"" of the religious community meant that the living spirit of the Shakers would flourish only for a short while - in simple beauty like a gloriously pink cherry blossom. [That aspect of the Shakers is due to its founder who was repulsed by her own sexuality...ostensibly the only part of her spirituality that is questionable].This documentary could not be made today because the few Shakers alive (in 1984) give interviews and talk firsthand about their early experiences at the turn of the century and the meaning of living in this unique religious community...even to sing us their songs.  Thank you...Ken Burns!Other reviewers have talked about the fact that the Shakers preached equality of all races and sexes...and lived accordingly.  And this was so in an early America that was still deeply segregated and prejudiced. The disclosure that Abraham Lincoln created precedent by granting one of the Shaker men an ""exemption from military service"" on the ground of being a conscientious objector is an important part of our civil liberty history.My all time favorite photo essay is ""Inner Light"" by Linda Butler. It contains the very best  black & white photos of Shaker designs and architecture in print.  And there are a few radiant essays by Thomas Merton in his book ""Seeking Paradise.""  [By the way, this documentary is also available in written form in the photo-essay volume by Amy Stechler Burns].This is a documentary that can be watched over and over again without becoming tiresome.  For that reason, I give it 5 stars.",5,Take this Spiritual Odyssey...Accept this Gift,1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,2348,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'really', 'experience', 'Shakers', 'purity', 'religious', 'vision', 'actually', 'walking', 'one', 'preserved', 'New', 'England', 'Kentucky', 'perfection', 'simplicity', 'offered', 'God', 'can', 'then', 'be', 'felt', 'senses', 'three', 'dimensions', 'unforgettable.Perhaps', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'obtaining', 'documentary', 'great', 'scientist', 'once', 'said', 'simplicity', 'greatest', 'sophistication', 'idea', 'expressed', 'Shaker', 'furniture', 'designs', 'architecture', 'are', 'well', 'photographed', 'documentary', 'attending', 'museum', 'exhibition', 'American', 'arts', 'crafts', 'furniture', 'occurred', 'simplicity', 'line', 'arts', 'crafts', 'America', 'Europe', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'derived', 'Shaker', 'ideas.True..the', 'requirement', 'celibacy', 'members', 'religious', 'community', 'meant', 'living', 'spirit', 'Shakers', 'would', 'flourish', 'only', 'short', 'simple', 'beauty', 'gloriously', 'pink', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'aspect', 'Shakers', 'due', 'founder', 'who', 'was', 'repulsed', 'own', 'sexuality', 'ostensibly', 'only', 'part', 'spirituality', 'questionable', '.This', 'documentary', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'today', 'few', 'Shakers', 'alive', '1984', 'give', 'interviews', 'talk', 'firsthand', 'early', 'experiences', 'turn', 'century', 'meaning', 'living', 'unique', 'religious', 'community', 'even', 'sing', 'songs', 'Thank', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'talked', 'fact', 'Shakers', 'preached', 'equality', 'races', 'sexes', 'lived', 'accordingly', 'was', 'so', 'early', 'America', 'was', 'still', 'deeply', 'segregated', 'prejudiced', 'disclosure', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'created', 'precedent', 'granting', 'one', 'Shaker', 'men', 'exemption', 'military', 'service', 'ground', 'being', 'conscientious', 'objector', 'important', 'part', 'civil', 'liberty', 'history.My', 'time', 'favorite', 'photo', 'essay', 'Inner', 'Light', 'Linda', 'Butler', 'very', 'best', 'black', 'white', 'photos', 'Shaker', 'designs', 'architecture', 'print', 'are', 'few', 'radiant', 'essays', 'Thomas', 'Merton', 'book', 'Seeking', 'Paradise', '[', 'way', 'documentary', 'also', 'available', 'written', 'form', 'photo-essay', 'volume', 'Amy', 'Stechler', 'Burns', ']', '.This', 'documentary', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'becoming', 'tiresome', 'reason', 'give', '5', 'stars']",N/A

Never larger than a few thousand men and women, this group accomplished an amazing amount and their legacy is out of all proportion to their numbers.  Ken Burns does a very superficial job here. Next to nothing is said about their radical theology: Mother Ann was seen as the second coming of Christ in female form. Ken Burns, who did such a good job with the Civil War, never mentions that the Shakers' numbers grew radically after the upheavals of the Civil War left many people seeking extreme religious lifestyles. While there are examples of Shaker music, no one discusses the unique style of their hymns. The vast Shaker thological literature that survives seems to have little interest to him.

Due to declining new members, especially young members (a great deal of their new members came from caring for orphans, which were cut off from them as the twentieth century went along), the Shakers decided to close their final settlements. But the Shakers were morally impressive and inspirational.  They avoided involvement in the capitalist system by being self-sustaining and maintaining a few supporting industries.  They are famous, of course, for their purely functional yet nonetheless beautiful furniture and design and architecture.  The buildings they show in the documentary were incredibly beautiful.  They have a wonderful simplicity and some amazing lines.  I loved their progressive social stances on the role of women and their abhorrence of slavery and other forms of oppression.  Their tolerance and extreme generosity was the antithesis of contemporary attitudes.  When one settlement discovered that others were stealing some of their crops, they simple started planting more.I can understand how the Shakers were not able to survive.  As a celibate community they relied exclusively upon people deciding to join; they depended upon converts.

While The Shakers has good ratings on Amazon.com, it simply didn't interest me.The Shakers thoroughly covers their history. However, the film should have explained more about why religious sects (The Mormons, The Oneidans, etc.) flourished in the early-1800s U.S. Burns does a good job of explaining the Shakers' beliefs in the then-radical idea of equal rights for all.There should have been more about Sister Ann Lee, the Shakers founder. She built the community, but also insisted that The Shakers remain celibate, which ultimately doomed  them. Sister Ann had four children of her own, but all died during childhood. It is interesting to ponder whether there is a connection between Lewis' tragic experience and her insistence on celibacy - but the film never discusses it.Ultimately, the film is slow moving and uninteresting. The Shakers were great architects and furniture makers, but Burns' discussions are dry and overly long. Also, there is a lot of Shaker music that - to my ears - is awful.After about 45 minutes of The Shakers, I looked over and noticed that my wife had fallen asleep.
