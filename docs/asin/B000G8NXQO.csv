It runs at a brisk pace (About 83 Minutes) features some wackiness (Rollerblading guy at the beginning jumping off a bridge and later Standing like a statue in the police station is hilarious aswell as a guy getting a Cigarette shoved into his ear), Some stilted-performances, A Fat guy with a Rad 'stache who pisses off James Remar, Good action scenes for a small budgeted film, etc.... This is great stuff. James Remar really should've had more roles where he was the star. He had great Potential as a leading man in my eyes, i've thought that ever since i saw the Warriors. Anyway, give this a try. You shouldn't be disappointed if you're a fan of great low budget B-action films. I know i wasn't.

999407,A2UYESWHWMY6V3,B000G8NXQO,N. forrest,"[3, 3]",Great 80's action flick. Think of Patrick Swayze in this role and you get the idea. Remar was probably third or fourth choice but he was good in the lead. This is a great grade B movie all the way. Just love the feel and look of the movie.

From the moment he picked up his barbell and did one press before throwing it down in conclusion, I knew this was a different kind of action film.  It doesn't have the rhythm of most shoot em ups.  Remar's character, while definitely a hero, endures a lot of physical abuse before acheiving a victory.  And you will never guess who the main heavy is.  It's almost as if we are discovering the secrets of this crime ring along with Remar.  I am really glad this is finally coming out on DVD.
