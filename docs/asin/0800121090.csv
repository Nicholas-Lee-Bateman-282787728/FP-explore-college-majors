162033,A1LBF5XZNYD6QR,0800121090,Brett Johnson,"[4, 7]","""Calendar Girl"" is about three young men in the '60s who go on a trip to Hollywood to try and meet their dream woman...Marilyn Monroe.  Roy (Jason Priestly) is the leader of their little group and gets his hands on both a car and some cash to finance their adventure.  Unfortunately, he didn't exactly obtain those things honestly.  A couple of goons called the Gallo brothers go to Hollywood to try and find Roy.  That's because the money that Roy got his hands on was stolen from them.  The Gallos end up being the sole bright spot of the film.  One of them is deaf and they use sign language to communicate.  What's really cool is the way that they sign in unison throughout the film.  They are so smooth in their signing that it is fascinating to watch them together.  Stephen Tobolowsky (Antonio Gallo) is his usual humorous self and plays the part of a sarcastic thug quite well.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't have as good of a flow to it.  The three main characters don't have much in the way of charm or intelligence.  They just kinda stumble along, occasionally coming up with pathetic schemes to try and get close to Marilyn.  One of them eventually goes on a late night drive and stroll with Miss Monroe.  However, it all seems rather anti-climactic and the movie quickly ends afterwards.For those of you so inclined, you might want to check out ""Calendar Girl"" for the scene when they try to find Marilyn at a nude beach.  It's extremely revealing for a movie that isn't rated R.",2,LOOKING FOR MARILYN.,1013385600,"02 11, 2002",2002,1505,"['Calendar', 'Girl', 'three', 'young', 'men', ""'60s"", 'who', 'go', 'trip', 'Hollywood', 'try', 'meet', 'dream', 'woman', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Roy', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'leader', 'little', 'group', 'hands', 'car', 'cash', 'finance', 'adventure', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'obtain', 'things', 'honestly', 'couple', 'goons', 'called', 'Gallo', 'brothers', 'go', 'Hollywood', 'try', 'find', 'Roy', 'money', 'Roy', 'got', 'hands', 'was', 'stolen', 'Gallos', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'sole', 'bright', 'spot', 'film', 'One', 'deaf', 'use', 'sign', 'language', 'communicate', 'What', 'really', 'cool', 'way', 'sign', 'unison', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'smooth', 'signing', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'together', 'Stephen', 'Tobolowsky', 'Antonio', 'Gallo', 'usual', 'humorous', 'self', 'part', 'sarcastic', 'thug', 'quite', 'well.Unfortunately', 'rest', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'good', 'flow', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'way', 'charm', 'intelligence', 'just', 'kinda', 'stumble', 'along', 'occasionally', 'coming', 'up', 'pathetic', 'schemes', 'try', 'get', 'close', 'Marilyn', 'One', 'eventually', 'late', 'night', 'drive', 'stroll', 'Miss', 'Monroe', 'However', 'rather', 'anti-climactic', 'movie', 'quickly', 'afterwards.For', 'so', 'inclined', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Calendar', 'Girl', 'scene', 'when', 'try', 'find', 'Marilyn', 'nude', 'beach', 'extremely', 'revealing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'rated', 'R']",N/A

This movie is really for those of us who just need to sit and watch a cute, campy movie that's fun and entertaining.  (But, that's just my opinion.)  This movie has parts that draw you in because they're so silly.  (Jason isn't normally one of my favorite actors, but he plays his part to a &quot;t&quot; in this movie.) He has trouble communicating with his dad, they do work it out before Jason has to go off to Viet Nam. My favorite part is Jason and his father in the boxing ring &quot;working it out&quot; as a matter of fact, but only because they knew of no other way ..it was so sad, that's a plus.  The guys get a chance to go to Hollywood and stay with the rich, Hollywood type uncle of Jason's character, so they take it.  For one helluva week, they cavort all over trying to get a glimpse of Marilyn, if not speak to her directly. Stuff they get into.....they &quot;boost&quot; a cow haul it to her front yard, wet it down with the hose and pretend it's sad and mooing for her to come rescue it.  (Ned, or one of them read she cried over a wet cow when she was young! Funny stuff)  They have &quot;bad guys&quot; chasing Priestly for skimming some mob money from them............even that's funny.....there are no bloody parts and lots of light humor. One of the guys actually gets to go on a date with Ms. Monroe, much to his enjoyment...........then she dies, he hears it on the radio shortly after the date. (suicide, I think not!)  Great little, likeable flick..........but, that's just my opinion......rent it.  I had to have it for my collection....",3,Like Marilyn Monroe?

162036,A17PNW5KFXRDT3,0800121090,fsnva,"[0, 0]","This is the story of three guys and their obsession with Marilyn Monroe, so much so, that they take a road trip to Hollywood back in 1962 to meet her.  Comic hijinks ensues. That's pretty much it for the plot, as Roy (Jason Priestley), Ned, (Gabriel Olds), and Scott (Jerry O'Connell), all just out of high school and about to take the next uncertain step in life, scamper around LA-LA land trying desperately to meet up with the most famous and recognized American woman of the 20th Century.  They sleep in their car and watch her house incessantly all night, certain that if they could meet the woman of their dreams for just one moment, she would be madly taken with their adolescent charm.  They also have to avoid a pair of loan sharks trying to get back the money Roy stole from them to pay for the trip.CALENDAR GIRL was clearly intended to be a star vehicle for Jason Priestley, who had just rocketed to fame on TV as the star of BEVERLY HILLS 90210-Penny Marshall was one of the producers-but it was simply too slight and mild a story to interest moviegoers in the late summer of 1993 to make it a hit. The fact that we only get a few brief glimpses of Marilyn, darting to and fro, works against the story; how much better this movie would have been if the screenwriter had made Marilyn a major character.  Maybe have her actually meet up with the three dudes and go off with them for a day and a night to get away from the stress of her fish bowl life in Hollywood-her troubles with fame are well documented and could have been worked into the plot.  Marilyn Monroe and three teenage boys loose on the town in 1962; could have been the plot of a good coming of age story.  But that would have created quite a problem for the film makers: how do you recreate the awesomeness of the woman who sang ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" to JFK?As it is, CALENDAR GIRL does a good job of recreating the early 1960's, one of the most romanticized eras in American history, especially by older baby boomers; the bright colors and big cars look like they came right off a cover of an old issue of LIFE magazine.  Priestley is good as Roy, the more cocky and self assured of the trio of guys and this was the first time we noticed how much Jerry O'Connell had grown up since STAND BY ME.  A lot of reviewers wonder what ever happened to Gabriel Olds, a check of IMDB says he guest starred on BOARDWALK EMPIRE not long ago.  One big asset is the presence of Joe Pantoliano, Steve Railsback, Kurt Fuller, and Stephen Tobolowsky, four great character stars, in the supporting cast.  Would the nude beach scene get this movie an R rating today?  Basically all we see is some buns, but so much has changed since the 80's and early 90's when you could still get quite a bit of raunch in a PG-13 movie.Anyway, the early Neil Sedaka still rocks.",4,"Stalking Marilyn, but in a good way.",1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,2833,"['story', 'three', 'guys', 'obsession', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'take', 'road', 'trip', 'Hollywood', 'back', '1962', 'meet', 'Comic', 'hijinks', 'ensues', 'pretty', 'much', 'plot', 'Roy', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'Ned', 'Gabriel', 'Olds', 'Scott', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'just', 'high', 'school', 'take', 'next', 'uncertain', 'step', 'life', 'scamper', 'LA-LA', 'land', 'trying', 'desperately', 'meet', 'up', 'most', 'famous', 'recognized', 'American', 'woman', '20th', 'Century', 'sleep', 'car', 'watch', 'house', 'incessantly', 'night', 'certain', 'could', 'meet', 'woman', 'dreams', 'just', 'one', 'moment', 'would', 'be', 'madly', 'taken', 'adolescent', 'charm', 'also', 'have', 'avoid', 'pair', 'loan', 'sharks', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'money', 'Roy', 'stole', 'pay', 'trip.CALENDAR', 'GIRL', 'was', 'clearly', 'intended', 'be', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'rocketed', 'fame', 'TV', 'star', 'BEVERLY', 'HILLS', '90210-Penny', 'Marshall', 'was', 'one', 'producers-but', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'slight', 'mild', 'story', 'interest', 'moviegoers', 'late', 'summer', '1993', 'make', 'hit', 'fact', 'only', 'get', 'few', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'Marilyn', 'darting', 'fro', 'works', 'story', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'screenwriter', 'had', 'made', 'Marilyn', 'major', 'character', 'Maybe', 'have', 'actually', 'meet', 'up', 'three', 'dudes', 'go', 'off', 'day', 'night', 'get', 'away', 'stress', 'fish', 'bowl', 'life', 'Hollywood-her', 'troubles', 'fame', 'are', 'well', 'documented', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worked', 'plot', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'three', 'teenage', 'boys', 'loose', 'town', '1962', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'plot', 'good', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'created', 'quite', 'problem', 'film', 'makers', 'how', 'do', 'recreate', 'awesomeness', 'woman', 'who', 'sang', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'Mr.', 'President', 'JFK', 'CALENDAR', 'GIRL', 'good', 'job', 'recreating', 'early', '1960', 'one', 'most', 'romanticized', 'eras', 'American', 'history', 'especially', 'older', 'baby', 'boomers', 'bright', 'colors', 'big', 'cars', 'look', 'came', 'right', 'cover', 'old', 'issue', 'LIFE', 'magazine', 'Priestley', 'good', 'Roy', 'more', 'cocky', 'self', 'assured', 'trio', 'guys', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'noticed', 'how', 'much', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'STAND', 'BY', 'ME', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'wonder', 'what', 'ever', 'happened', 'Gabriel', 'Olds', 'check', 'IMDB', 'guest', 'starred', 'BOARDWALK', 'EMPIRE', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'One', 'big', 'asset', 'presence', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Steve', 'Railsback', 'Kurt', 'Fuller', 'Stephen', 'Tobolowsky', 'four', 'great', 'character', 'stars', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Would', 'nude', 'beach', 'scene', 'get', 'movie', 'R', 'rating', 'today', 'Basically', 'see', 'buns', 'so', 'much', 'changed', '80', 'early', '90', 'when', 'could', 'still', 'get', 'quite', 'bit', 'raunch', 'PG-13', 'movie.Anyway', 'early', 'Neil', 'Sedaka', 'still']",N/A
162037,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,0800121090,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[2, 2]","This movie was a decent road trip /coming-of-age movie in it's time...it never pretended to be anything other than what it was, and I respect that.Three best buds from childhood, (red-blooded american types),in the early 60's, led by the very studly, 23-yrs young, Jason Priestley,(who was fresh off of his stint on ""Beverly Hills 90210""),go on a trek across America to Hollywood to try to get a glimpse(and hopefully a date) with the legendary sex symbol Marilyn Monroe.Priestley's character is very much obsessed with Marilyn..in fact, hewants to make love to her so good, that she proclaims him as the bestlover she's ever had!!  (Quite an adolescent and slightly piggish vision!).Anywayz, he leads himself and his buddies onan interesting and eventful journey which has somefunny moments as well as some poignant ones too.Priestley's character is a lowly young street tough from Middle Americawith cool and good looks to burn! He has some big dreams and seeks tobreak free from his mundane exsistence, and even to escape somechildhood demons in the process.He sees Hollywood, and his childhood lust for Marilyn Monroeas a spring board for him to find what he's looking for!He has also enlisted in the service, and is planning to leaveright after his imagined dream night with Monroe.I love Priestley's characters' fearlessness and balls-out enthusiasm.It reminds you of what it's like to be young, somewhat naive,and bold enough to follow your heart into hell and back!His childhhood buddies, played by a young Jerry MacConnell,and Gabriel Olds, look up to Priestley's character in a way.He has moxie and thinks quick on his feet,though not always with clarity & foresight.But then again, they are just some young guys from Middle America.A lot of Preistley fans like this film, because they get to seeJason Priestley's early 20's, lean tight body in early 60's periodshirts & pants that do it justice all the way around, if you get my drift.He's dynamite in a diminuative 5'8"" frame! (-:Also, you get to see his very taut & tatooed naked buns,as he and his buddies find themselves on a nude beach,following who they think is none other thanMarilyn Monroe, who's frolicking au naturalealong it's sandy shores...Hey, when in Rome, right? (-:I'm just happy that it has finally been released to DVD.When I originally wrote this review, it was regarding the VHSversion, which was the only way you could see this for years.I ordered it a few weeks ago, and it came the other day.The DVD quality is widescreen and is very clear-sounding and looking,when you think about the fact that this movie is now 20 yrs old.My Blu-Ray player upconverts it to near HD quality.I'd give this film 3 1/2 to 4 stars topsfor it's overall effect, even though it's kind of dated now,but it was decently entertaining to young adult audiences in its time.Jason Preistley got his big break (for a time) in TV,but sadly, never had the big screen success of his one timestruggling actor buddy/roomate, Brad Pitt, who had that extra""it"" factor, that transferred over to the big screen more successfully.But Preistley is a good actor, a decent director and producer as well,who still has respect in Hollywood.He turned in some great performances, both on TV (though the shows didn'tlast as long as ""90210"" did, and in films like the excellent""Love & Death On Long Island"", and the hilarious ""Die Mommie Die!!"",made in the years since this, his first big screen movie, was made in 1993.Joe Pantaliano is good as his actor uncle, who they stay with while in Hollywood,and hunky 80's/early 90's B-Movie hunk, Maxwell Caulfield makes an appearance
