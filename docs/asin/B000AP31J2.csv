930606,A24VH95PVW4ZRR,B000AP31J2,Eira,"[0, 0]","Let me begin by saying that I should give this two separate reviews. I can't do that, however. I can give one review with my complete opinion.So: if I rate this based on enjoyment of the plot, characters and art, with the original Japanese voice actors and English subtitles, I really, really like this anime and it gets 5 stars. HOWEVER, if I review the English dubs separately, this gets NO STARS. It gets sent to Hel with no hope of reprieve.I'm not Asatru myself, though I have a lot of friends who are - I'm a Druid, so these are not my gods, although they're friends of my gods, so to speak. I might feel very different if I were Asatru (those who honor the Norse gods in modern times), but as it is, I love this. My gods are not easily offended and are well-known for their sense of humor; I don't know the Norse gods so well, but many of them strike me as much the same, so the portrayals of their characters in this anime are a lot of fun for me.The plot is both entertaining and inventive, and the art is absolutely adorable; the art is so adorable, in fact, that the reason I came here at all was because I could not find another source to stream this anime that did not have horrifically bad quality video.And now we come to the less pleasant half of the review:I was thrilled to come here and find this, until the speaking began; once the speaking began, I was in the Abyss of Torment, whatever your religion may call that. I came here to give a review of 1 star because I was so enraged over the pathetic, disgusting, insipid English dubs - then I had to revise my thinking because the anime itself deserves a really high rating. It's only when it gets raped by whoever decided to dub it that it becomes a thing of hideous horror.Guys, come on. >.&lt; The Japanese voice actors lent so much elegance and precision to this script, and I can *ABSOLUTELY* guarantee you that my three children and I could do a better job of dubbing this in English than these voice actors did - even though we only know a little bit of Japanese.So, to summarize: Really horrible job on the part of the English-dub team. Vomitously pathetic. Love it in Japanese with English subs, though.",3,5 Stars v. 1 Star,1349395200,"10 5, 2012",2012,2181,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'should', 'give', 'two', 'separate', 'reviews', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'however', 'can', 'give', 'one', 'review', 'complete', 'opinion.So', 'rate', 'based', 'enjoyment', 'plot', 'characters', 'art', 'original', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'English', 'subtitles', 'really', 'really', 'anime', '5', 'stars', 'HOWEVER', 'review', 'English', 'dubs', 'separately', 'STARS', 'sent', 'Hel', 'hope', 'reprieve.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'Asatru', 'have', 'lot', 'friends', 'who', 'are', ""'m"", 'Druid', 'are', 'not', 'gods', ""'re"", 'friends', 'gods', 'so', 'speak', 'might', 'feel', 'very', 'different', 'were', 'Asatru', 'who', 'honor', 'Norse', 'gods', 'modern', 'times', 'love', 'gods', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'are', 'well-known', 'sense', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Norse', 'gods', 'so', 'well', 'many', 'strike', 'much', 'same', 'portrayals', 'characters', 'anime', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'me.The', 'plot', 'entertaining', 'inventive', 'art', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'art', 'so', 'adorable', 'fact', 'reason', 'came', 'here', 'was', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'source', 'stream', 'anime', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'horrifically', 'bad', 'quality', 'video.And', 'now', 'come', 'less', 'pleasant', 'half', 'review', 'was', 'thrilled', 'come', 'here', 'find', 'speaking', 'began', 'once', 'speaking', 'began', 'was', 'Abyss', 'Torment', 'religion', 'may', 'call', 'came', 'here', 'give', 'review', '1', 'star', 'was', 'so', 'enraged', 'pathetic', 'disgusting', 'insipid', 'English', 'dubs', 'then', 'had', 'revise', 'thinking', 'anime', 'really', 'high', 'rating', 'only', 'when', 'raped', 'whoever', 'decided', 'dub', 'thing', 'hideous', 'horror.Guys', 'come', '>', 'lt', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'lent', 'so', 'much', 'elegance', 'precision', 'script', 'can', '*ABSOLUTELY*', 'guarantee', 'three', 'children', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'dubbing', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'did', 'even', 'only', 'know', 'little', 'bit', 'Japanese.So', 'summarize', 'Really', 'horrible', 'job', 'part', 'English-dub', 'team', 'Vomitously', 'pathetic', 'Love', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subs', 'though']",N/A

Robbins ""PJJR Group""","[1, 4]","While this anime has good voice acting, good animtaion as well as some funny parts; its really not that special when compared to many other animes that don't take themselves too seriously like this one does. Anyway, this anime's issues are what keeps it from being a good one and makes it become more like a mediocre one. It's issues are:- Its plot is paper thin and the characters aren't developed enough.- This anime relies heavily on filler and not enough on plot and character development, filler dominates this entire anime and makes it boring.- It's script is weak and too light-hearted.- It's action scenes don't have enough substance to them and are too simplistic. They need to be a bit longer and a lot more exciting.- This anime is too light hearted in its plot, its execution and its main antagonist: Odin, has a very weak reason for wanting to kill Loki. This god basically wants Loki to die because this god found out that through a prediction that Loki will bring darkness upon the world around us. This is a weak reason for Odin to want Loki dead, when there is a so much better way for Odin to deal with Loki about this.-Nothing really happens in terms of plot development in this anime.- Hel a.k.a. Loki's daughter, is a pointless character and doesn't really add anything to this anime; she is part of the filler in this anime.[...]Overall these issues plague this show and make it more along the lines of mediocre rather than the opposite of this. 5/10",2,"Heavy on looks, light on substance",1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,1472,"['anime', 'good', 'voice', 'acting', 'good', 'animtaion', 'as', 'well', 'funny', 'parts', 'really', 'not', 'special', 'when', 'compared', 'many', 'other', 'animes', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'one', 'Anyway', 'anime', 'issues', 'are', 'what', 'being', 'good', 'one', 'become', 'more', 'mediocre', 'one', 'issues', 'are', 'plot', 'paper', 'thin', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'developed', 'enough.-', 'anime', 'heavily', 'filler', 'not', 'enough', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'filler', 'entire', 'anime', 'boring.-', 'script', 'weak', 'too', 'light-hearted.-', 'action', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'substance', 'are', 'too', 'simplistic', 'need', 'be', 'bit', 'longer', 'lot', 'more', 'exciting.-', 'anime', 'too', 'light', 'hearted', 'plot', 'execution', 'main', 'antagonist', 'Odin', 'very', 'weak', 'reason', 'wanting', 'kill', 'Loki', 'god', 'basically', 'Loki', 'die', 'god', 'found', 'out', 'prediction', 'Loki', 'will', 'bring', 'darkness', 'world', 'weak', 'reason', 'Odin', 'want', 'Loki', 'dead', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'way', 'Odin', 'deal', 'Loki', 'this.-Nothing', 'really', 'terms', 'plot', 'development', 'anime.-', 'Hel', 'a.k.a', 'Loki', 'daughter', 'pointless', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'anime', 'part', 'filler', 'anime.', '[', ']', 'Overall', 'issues', 'plague', 'show', 'make', 'more', 'lines', 'mediocre', 'rather', 'opposite', '5/10']",N/A
930611,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B000AP31J2,RavenRing,"[6, 6]","I grew up with an interest in Norse mythology, so when I saw an anime with both 'Loki' and 'Ragnarok' in the title, I was immediately interested. Reading the description I knew that not to expect too much of a connection to the old stories, but I thought it would fun none the less. I am glad I picked it up :)Loki, the god of mischief, was cast from the world of the gods down to the human world. In order to return he must collect the spirits of evil that posses human hearts. The thing is, for reasons unknown, during his stay in the human world he is bound to the form of a child. In order to hunt down his quarry, he starts a detective agency and somehow manages to get stuck with a teenage girl named Mayura as an assistant. Things aren't going to bad for Loki, until the other Norse gods and goddesses start showing up trying to kill him!The Nose mythology was my favorite part of this series, but I also enjoyed the plot and characters. Loki is an entertaining character and Mayura an endearing one. The supporting cast is large and diverse, and it is always fun when a new god is introduced. I think this series would be most entertaining for people who know a little bit about the myths and legends this series draws from. I showed it to one friend who knew pretty much nothing about Norse mythology, and she found it cute and entertaining, but wasn't all that thrilled with it. But my sisters, who are all familiar with the Norse gods, all really enjoyed it.If you enjoy the series and decide to hunt down the manga, be aware of two things - first, the manga this is based on is actually called Mythical Detective Loki and Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok is the sequel (which the anime has no relation too). Second, only the first two volumes of the second series are available in the US. For some reason, Singapore released an English translation of both manga series, and it is possible to find them on eBay. I liked the manga better than the anime, but after paying international shipping + the cost of the books, it is cheaper to get the anime!",5,The Norse Gods in Shojo Form!,1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,2060,"['grew', 'up', 'interest', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'when', 'saw', 'anime', ""'Loki"", ""'Ragnarok"", 'title', 'was', 'immediately', 'interested', 'Reading', 'description', 'knew', 'not', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'connection', 'old', 'stories', 'thought', 'would', 'fun', 'none', 'less', 'am', 'glad', 'picked', 'up', 'Loki', 'god', 'mischief', 'was', 'cast', 'world', 'gods', 'down', 'human', 'world', 'order', 'return', 'must', 'collect', 'spirits', 'evil', 'human', 'hearts', 'thing', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'stay', 'human', 'world', 'bound', 'form', 'child', 'order', 'hunt', 'down', 'quarry', 'detective', 'agency', 'somehow', 'manages', 'get', 'stuck', 'teenage', 'girl', 'named', 'Mayura', 'assistant', 'Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'bad', 'Loki', 'other', 'Norse', 'gods', 'goddesses', 'start', 'showing', 'up', 'trying', 'kill', 'Nose', 'mythology', 'was', 'favorite', 'part', 'series', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'plot', 'characters', 'Loki', 'entertaining', 'character', 'Mayura', 'endearing', 'one', 'supporting', 'cast', 'large', 'diverse', 'always', 'fun', 'when', 'new', 'god', 'introduced', 'think', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'entertaining', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'little', 'bit', 'myths', 'series', 'showed', 'one', 'friend', 'who', 'knew', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'found', 'cute', 'entertaining', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'sisters', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'Norse', 'gods', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'it.If', 'enjoy', 'series', 'decide', 'hunt', 'down', 'manga', 'be', 'aware', 'two', 'things', 'first', 'manga', 'based', 'actually', 'called', 'Mythical', 'Detective', 'Loki', 'Mythical', 'Detective', 'Loki', 'Ragnarok', 'sequel', 'anime', 'relation', 'too', 'Second', 'only', 'first', 'two', 'volumes', 'second', 'series', 'are', 'available', 'US', 'reason', 'Singapore', 'released', 'English', 'translation', 'manga', 'series', 'possible', 'find', 'eBay', 'liked', 'manga', 'better', 'anime', 'paying', 'international', 'shipping', 'cost', 'books', 'cheaper', 'get', 'anime']",N/A

Even though he looks like a normal human boy, his mind has not been effected, and he still has some magical powers, though reduced. Along with his assistant Yamino he runs the Enjaku Detective Agency which seems to investigate only paranormal activities. When a young girl named Mayura who happens to be a mystery otaku comes to Loki wanting his help to find a ghostly talking doll, Loki reluctantly takes the case. Of course, you know Mayura is going to bully her way into becoming the third member of the agency after the case is solved! There are other gods lurking in the shadows along with Loki, and some of them are following the orders of Odin, the order to KILL Loki!Loki Ragnarok is a show I would describe best as ""harmless"". The character designs for the kids especially come off as entirely too dorky for my taste. I mean at least let Loki retain some dignity with his wardrobe for Pete's sake! You could put a dress on him and he'd be Cardcaptor Sakura! But this first volume does have its moments of humor, even if it's dragged down by the Loki pulling out his wand power-up sequences. Probably the best episode here is when Mayura's dad forbids her to hang out with the Detective Agency and to leave her little girl interests behind her. Loki, in A Christmas Carol like manner, lets them relive their memories of how Mayura first got it into her head to be a sleuth.
