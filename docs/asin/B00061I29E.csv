855249,AZUBX0AYYNTFF,B00061I29E,Donald M. Bishop,"[0, 0]","This is a film of moods and scenes.  Zhou Yu (Gong Li) is attracted to both to a bookish poet and a realistic veterinarian, two men with opposite characters.  Her reactions to their personalities make ""Zhou Yu's Train"" very much a movie of moods.  It's also a study of indecision because the moods of the three main characters seem untied to any sense of what they want from life, or where their relationships should lead.Many recent Chinese movies revolve around the new choices that Chinese may make as their country develops, but they also show implicitly that China's 20th century history left many without a moral (or ethical or religious) compass to align their life choices with a sense of purpose or direction.  The train trips are thus part of the film's plot structure.  Zhou Yu travels to meet the poet and the veterinarian, but the many trips show metaphorically she hasn't determined a final destination.The cinematography includes some fine views of Chinese cities and countryside, workplaces, and people.  The scenes of trains -- roadbeds, tracks, railroad yards, stations, and bridges -- are extremely well done.

855250,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00061I29E,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[13, 14]","ZHOU YU'S TRAIN is the type of film that may -- just may -- require repeat viewing in order to take in all the thia story has to offer: if you blink -- much like the effect of the quickly passing scenery out the window of any train -- you might miss something better explored, as the ending of this evenly-paced romance shows.While one could hardly argue with the notion that there are parts of TRAIN that appear uneven and, at least, forced, the film still manages to deliver a perspective worth a single view: Zhou Yu falls in love with a poet she must take the train to see, but, aboard the train, she finds herself somewhat distracted by a veterinarian who insists -- despites her mild protests -- on pursuing her affections.  As a result, TRAIN explores more than one budding relationship and can be confusing on more than one occasion.  In fact, one could make the argument that what truly is transpiring here cannot be fully appreciated until the film's final few moments, and, even then, the viewer may be left with many unanswered questions.  However, what is clear is Zhou's desire to seek the answers to questions of the various loves in her life (two men, friendship, art, etc.), and the narrative clearly appears to be a device through which an exploration of the female mind and heart is undertaken.  Whether you reach a destination is entirely up to the viewr.Of course, the best scenery is, indeed, Gong Li.  If you're a fan of her work, then TRAIN is definitely for you.",3,Take the Train,1100217600,"11 12, 2004",2004,1487,"['ZHOU', 'YU', 'TRAIN', 'type', 'film', 'may', 'just', 'may', 'require', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'order', 'take', 'thia', 'story', 'offer', 'blink', 'much', 'effect', 'quickly', 'passing', 'scenery', 'window', 'train', 'might', 'miss', 'something', 'better', 'explored', 'ending', 'evenly-paced', 'romance', 'shows.While', 'one', 'could', 'hardly', 'argue', 'notion', 'are', 'parts', 'TRAIN', 'appear', 'uneven', 'least', 'forced', 'film', 'still', 'deliver', 'perspective', 'worth', 'single', 'view', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'love', 'poet', 'must', 'take', 'train', 'see', 'train', 'somewhat', 'distracted', 'veterinarian', 'who', 'mild', 'protests', 'pursuing', 'affections', 'result', 'TRAIN', 'more', 'one', 'budding', 'relationship', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'fact', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'argument', 'what', 'transpiring', 'here', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'film', 'final', 'few', 'moments', 'even', 'then', 'viewer', 'may', 'be', 'left', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'However', 'what', 'clear', 'Zhou', 'desire', 'seek', 'answers', 'questions', 'various', 'loves', 'life', 'two', 'men', 'friendship', 'art', 'etc', 'narrative', 'clearly', 'be', 'device', 'exploration', 'female', 'mind', 'heart', 'undertaken', 'Whether', 'reach', 'destination', 'entirely', 'viewr.Of', 'course', 'best', 'scenery', 'indeed', 'Gong', 'Li', ""'re"", 'fan', 'work', 'then', 'TRAIN', 'definitely']",Zhou Yu's Train
855251,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B00061I29E,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[7, 8]","This is a beautiful lyrical film about experiencing love and being tempted ... essentially torn between two very different kinds of lovers. One lover is Chen Ching, a librarian and poet, who is highly romantic and the other is Dr. Zhang, a veterinarian, who is more down to earth, a realist. Zhou Yu [Gong Li] is in love with the poet whom she visits by train twice a week. She loves to ride the train to the city of Chongyang where she takes a tram ride over the river, and walks up a series of steps to his home. However, she is partially living in a dream world, and does not think much about the future. Her dreams are shattered into reality when she learns Chen Ching's job is being eliminated. He is offered a teaching job in a remote province of Tibet which he accepts. It is around that time Zhou Yu meets Dr. Zhang on the train who is fascinated by a large porcelain vase she carries. To him, it looks like an antique vase from the Qing Dynasty. He flirts with her - trying to discover more about why she is on the train so often ...During one of Zhou Yu's trips to see Chen Ching, she nearly faints on the train. The episode occurs after an unsuccessful poetry reading she sets up to promote the publication of Chen Ching's poems. She had sold her own hand-painted porcelain vases as well as family heirlooms to finance the publication of his writing. Dr. Zhang was asked to help a passenger on the train but he declined, using the excuse he is a veterinarian, he does not take care of people. This event came back to haunt him after meeting Zhou Yu for the first time. The conductor pointed out he asked Dr. Zhang to help her but he would not.Using the technique of flashbacks, the filmmaker provides a surreal feeling throughout the film which adds mystery, intensity and depth to the story. The method works very well throughout except when Xiu (a dual role played by Gong Li) enters the film. To this viewer, it is unclear who Xiu is. Initially she was mistaken to be Zhou Yu reminsicing about the past. Only at the end does it become clear what role she plays and that it is a different person altogether. There are many endearing scenes which occur on the train as Dr. Zhang and Zhou Yu strike up a friendship which eventually leads to a torrid love affair ... The playful quality of their flirtation, the challenging questions each poses to the other, leads to attraction and fascination which is very well portrayed.The mystery of Zhou Yu's visits to Chongyang becomes an emotional chasm between Dr. Zhang and Zhou Yu ... Trying to please Zhou Yu, Dr. Zhang accompanies her by train to visit a mysterious place called Xan Hu where there is supposed to be a lake. It is poetically described by Chen Ching as an ""enchanted celadon"" and used as a metaphor for their love. To Zhou Yu's disappointment, there is no lake. The poetic imagery of the lake haunts her ... Dr. Zhang tries to lift up her spirits and reassures her, ""If it is in your heart it is real. If it is not, it never was."" These soothing words are later spoken back to Dr. Zhang by Zhou Yu. They strike his heart with a bull's eye precision just as she intended. The entire film has an artistic dreamy quality. The scenery as viewed from the train is breath-takingly beautiful. Also, there are many subtle creative elements making it a pleasure to view again and again. One can miss so much with only one viewing due to the artistic quality of the film and possibly because of the translation from Chinese to English. The film explores the relationship called love by comparing and contrasting the practical vs imaginary, the real vs unreal, the romantic vs pragmatic through intense lyrical scenes which build up interest and intrigue. There is a surprise ending which is totally unexpected but very realistic.

855252,A5JLAU2ARJ0BO,B00061I29E,"Gadgester ""No Time, No Money""","[8, 9]","The story in Zhou Yu's Train is one about love and freedom.  The first topic was taboo in China until only recently (the fact that this film has no female nudity attests to the strict sensorship, both cultural and political, in that country) and the second still forbidden with austere legal enforcement.The film is a little confusing, especially in the first 30 minutes, due to the use of nonlinearity.  It almost seems convoluted, but once you brave on, you'll figure out the story.  I'll give a quick rundown of the plot.Zhou Yu, played by the talented actress Gong Li, is a locally successful porcelain painter.  One day, she meets a struggling shy poet called Chen Ching (Tony ""The Lover"" Leung) and they soon start seeing each other.  Zhou is also pursued by a playboy-like veterinarian named Zhang Qiang, whom she meets twice on the train ride to her friend's town: the first time when Zhou and Zhang board the train together and he breaks one of her porcelain bowls, the second time they are introduced to each other by their common friend, the train conductor.Now the story becomes easy to follow: Zhou wants Chen to commit, but Chen's self-doubt and struggling career propel him to escape from Zhou by going to Tibet.  Zhou tries to find a second love in Zhang but simply cannot stop loving Chen.  She goes off to look for Chen... well, I can't give the ending away!The beginning is confusing also because Gong is cast in two roles: that of Zhou (longer, curly hair), and a secondary character called Xiu (short hair), who appears occasionally until the end, when her role becomes clear.  In case you still don't get it, here's how it works (SPOILER ALERT!): Xiu is Chen's new girlfriend after Zhou's death in the bus accident.  She (Xiu) meets Chen after he has published his collection of poems (this happens at the start of the film).  And Xiu is the female narrator of the story.  She tells Chen ""don't try to find Zhou Yu in me,"" but obviously, she does want to play the role of Zhou Yu to Chen and make him love her.There's an innate beautiful quality to the film, thanks to the visually stunning cinematography.  (BTW, my friend Ann tells me the hilly city in the film is actually Chongqing, in southwestern China.)  Whether it's wideangle landscape, a dreamy indoor scene with soft sunlight coming through bamboo blinds, or sharp-focus close-ups of Gong's beautiful face or her character's beautiful porcelain, each shot in the film is well-composed, well-lit, and well-exposed, almost to perfection.  Together with a propelling original music soundtrack, Zhou Yu's Train is a worthy film watching experience.  If you are a fan of Gong's, you won't be disappointed; she proves her talent and, almost 40, her sensuality.",4,A beautiful gem,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,2737,"['story', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'Train', 'one', 'love', 'freedom', 'first', 'topic', 'was', 'taboo', 'China', 'only', 'recently', 'fact', 'film', 'female', 'nudity', 'strict', 'sensorship', 'cultural', 'political', 'country', 'second', 'still', 'austere', 'legal', 'enforcement.The', 'film', 'little', 'confusing', 'especially', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'due', 'use', 'nonlinearity', 'almost', 'convoluted', 'once', 'brave', ""'ll"", 'figure', 'out', 'story', ""'ll"", 'give', 'quick', 'rundown', 'plot.Zhou', 'Yu', 'played', 'talented', 'actress', 'Gong', 'Li', 'locally', 'successful', 'porcelain', 'painter', 'One', 'day', 'struggling', 'shy', 'poet', 'called', 'Chen', 'Ching', 'Tony', 'Lover', 'Leung', 'soon', 'start', 'seeing', 'other', 'Zhou', 'also', 'pursued', 'playboy-like', 'veterinarian', 'named', 'Zhang', 'Qiang', 'whom', 'twice', 'train', 'ride', 'friend', 'town', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'Zhou', 'Zhang', 'board', 'train', 'together', 'one', 'porcelain', 'bowls', 'second', 'time', 'are', 'introduced', 'other', 'common', 'friend', 'train', 'conductor.Now', 'story', 'easy', 'follow', 'Zhou', 'Chen', 'commit', 'Chen', 'self-doubt', 'struggling', 'career', 'propel', 'escape', 'Zhou', 'going', 'Tibet', 'Zhou', 'find', 'second', 'love', 'Zhang', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'loving', 'Chen', 'look', 'Chen', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'ending', 'away', 'beginning', 'confusing', 'also', 'Gong', 'cast', 'two', 'roles', 'Zhou', 'longer', 'curly', 'hair', 'secondary', 'character', 'called', 'Xiu', 'short', 'hair', 'who', 'occasionally', 'end', 'when', 'role', 'clear', 'case', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'here', 'how', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Xiu', 'Chen', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Zhou', 'death', 'bus', 'accident', 'Xiu', 'meets', 'Chen', 'published', 'collection', 'poems', 'start', 'film', 'Xiu', 'female', 'narrator', 'story', 'Chen', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'find', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'obviously', 'want', 'play', 'role', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'Chen', 'make', 'love', 'innate', 'beautiful', 'quality', 'film', 'thanks', 'visually', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'BTW', 'friend', 'Ann', 'hilly', 'city', 'film', 'actually', 'Chongqing', 'southwestern', 'China', 'wideangle', 'landscape', 'dreamy', 'indoor', 'scene', 'soft', 'sunlight', 'coming', 'bamboo', 'blinds', 'sharp-focus', 'close-ups', 'Gong', 'beautiful', 'face', 'character', 'beautiful', 'porcelain', 'shot', 'film', 'well-composed', 'well-lit', 'well-exposed', 'almost', 'perfection', 'Together', 'propelling', 'original', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'Train', 'worthy', 'film', 'watching', 'experience', 'are', 'fan', 'Gong', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'talent', 'almost', '40', 'sensuality']",Zhou Yu's Train
855253,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00061I29E,Grady Harp,"[32, 33]","ZHOU YU'S TRAIN is another beautiful film from China, refreshingly romantic and intimate film giving us a break from the constant onslaught of the Chinese martial arts films that have so deeply influenced the movie market around the world.  As directed by Zhou Sun this low-key tale concerns changes in the lives of three rather simple citizens of Northern China.  The simplicity is gratifyingly successful.Zhou Yu (played with exquisite subtlety by the magnificent Gong Li) is a working girl who is carrying on the family tradition of painting porcelain for exporters.  Unassuming, she meets Chen Ching (Tony Leung) who is a poet afraid of his talent and self-deprecating to a fault.  Zhou Yu hears the beauty in his work and falls in love with both the poetry and the poet.  Chen Ching lives out in the country and Zhou Yu must take a train to enjoy her very frequent trysts.Fate intervenes and on one of these train trips she encounters Zhang Qiang (Hanglei Sun), and affable handsome young Veterinarian who at first pursues her for her 'art' and is rebuffed by Zhou Yu, but the mustual initial physical attraction is undeniable. In time Zhou Yu seeks out the rather secretive Zhang Qiang in his country setting and the two begin a lusty affair.  Zhou Yu is torn between the poet and the doctor.  How the ultimate love triangle is resolved speaks to the age old questions of passion, art vs. science, and equivocation of the entangled heart.The scenery of China is beautifully captured and the camera says much about the current social levels of living in China.  The music is strangely completely Western when a bit of the old China music seems to be more appropriate to such an intimate tale.But it is the luminous, multifaceted performances by Gong Li especially and Tony Leung and Hanglei Sun that bring a rich credibility to this small tale.

The music, the scenery, the way the film is shot: asain movies are brought to another kind of level due to the amount of love put into them.Zhou Yu's Train is another example of beauty in a film.  Though this was not my favorite film (Star Runner was phenominal, a must see), it was still very pleasing to watch.  The story revolves around Zhou Yu, a young woman struggling with her desires: should she stay with the poetic, quiet man who lives so far away he requires long train rides twice a week just to be able to see his face...or should she dare let herself fall for someone new?

If you read up on it on some websites, they'll even tell you that you might miss a few things. I believe in this also but this movie for me gradually turned into one of my favorite movies.The story is set in China and based on Zhou Yu who is played by the beautiful Gong Li and her travels to and from her boyfriends home. Of course, she travels by train and this allows everything from her conversations to her thinking to herself to be slowed down.  This is where the film reminds me a little of a Wong Kar Wai film. The dialogue is very good but still not Kar Wai good. Zhou Yu's boyfriend Chen Ching is a poet who writes for himself but finds the courage to write a poem for Zhou Yu and give it to her.The very first poem he writes for her is the one that makes her fall in love with him. Zhou Yu is an artist herself and maybe more artistic than Chen Ching, she makes beautiful vases. She runs into a man named Chen Qing during her travels on the train. Chen notices a vase she is carrying with her but he really just likes Zhou Yu. Although Chen and Zhou Yu have noting in the beginning, they entertain each other with good conversations during their travels. They start to gradually develop a close relationship. The story then starts to deal with Zhou Yu having trouble because she has two men that love her but she loves one more than the other.I had a hard time watching this movie the first time. It was interesting, wasn't really boring but it gives you the feeling that you have to be in a certain mood to enjoy it. The continuous talking leads to good but light conflict between Zhou Yu and other characters but there is a surrounding mystery that gives it a bit of depth. Gong Li also plays another character who is that mystery but it comes to make sense by the end of the film. The acting was exceptional; I loved the playfulness of Zhou Yu's conversations with Qing and the seriousness of her conversations with Chen Ching.I came to ask myself if she was really in love with Ching, or if she was just in love with his poetry. I loved the camera views, picture quality, and definitely the settings. Having two of the characters on a train makes them have talk to each other but it also shows that they come to need to be on the train with each other. It actually makes a surprisingly sort of serene setting. The writing was great and does not let you down at all. If anything, I would warn a future viewer to give this movie more than one chance. If you can't make it through the first time, watch it again and I recommend watching it on a nice night. To me it is just a 5 star movie, it had perfect acting, a great story, and an ending I did not quite favor but it was still acceptable.",5,Took Some Time,1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,2798,"['Zhou', 'Yu', 'Train', 'certainly', 'one', 'films', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'read', 'up', 'websites', ""'ll"", 'even', 'tell', 'might', 'miss', 'few', 'things', 'believe', 'also', 'movie', 'gradually', 'turned', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies.The', 'story', 'set', 'China', 'based', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'who', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Gong', 'Li', 'travels', 'boyfriends', 'home', 'course', 'train', 'everything', 'conversations', 'thinking', 'herself', 'be', 'slowed', 'down', 'where', 'film', 'little', 'Wong', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'film', 'dialogue', 'very', 'good', 'still', 'not', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'good', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'boyfriend', 'Chen', 'Ching', 'poet', 'who', 'courage', 'write', 'poem', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'give', 'her.The', 'very', 'first', 'poem', 'one', 'fall', 'love', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'artist', 'herself', 'maybe', 'more', 'artistic', 'Chen', 'Ching', 'beautiful', 'vases', 'man', 'named', 'Chen', 'Qing', 'travels', 'train', 'Chen', 'vase', 'carrying', 'really', 'just', 'likes', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'Chen', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'have', 'noting', 'beginning', 'entertain', 'other', 'good', 'conversations', 'travels', 'start', 'gradually', 'develop', 'close', 'relationship', 'story', 'then', 'deal', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'having', 'trouble', 'two', 'men', 'love', 'one', 'more', 'other.I', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'boring', 'feeling', 'have', 'be', 'certain', 'mood', 'enjoy', 'continuous', 'talking', 'leads', 'good', 'light', 'conflict', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'other', 'characters', 'surrounding', 'mystery', 'bit', 'depth', 'Gong', 'Li', 'also', 'character', 'who', 'mystery', 'make', 'sense', 'end', 'film', 'acting', 'was', 'exceptional', 'loved', 'playfulness', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'conversations', 'Qing', 'seriousness', 'conversations', 'Chen', 'Ching.I', 'came', 'ask', 'was', 'really', 'love', 'Ching', 'was', 'just', 'love', 'poetry', 'loved', 'camera', 'views', 'picture', 'quality', 'definitely', 'settings', 'Having', 'two', 'characters', 'train', 'have', 'talk', 'other', 'also', 'come', 'need', 'be', 'train', 'other', 'actually', 'surprisingly', 'sort', 'serene', 'setting', 'writing', 'was', 'great', 'not', 'let', 'down', 'anything', 'would', 'warn', 'future', 'viewer', 'give', 'movie', 'more', 'one', 'chance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'first', 'time', 'watch', 'again', 'recommend', 'watching', 'nice', 'night', 'just', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'had', 'perfect', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'ending', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'favor', 'was', 'still', 'acceptable']",Zhou Yu's Train

It is also groundbreaking for a Chinese film because there are romantic scenes of hugging and kissing, all shot in soft focus and with great feeling.  The actress, Gong Li, who stars in the film, is beautiful.  And the acting is uniformly good.The story is confusing however.  It's about a woman who takes a long train ride twice each week to see her poet lover.  She meets another man on the train who is a veterinarian.  The audience soon realizes that he would be a better match for her but she doesn't think so and continues with her improbable romance with the poet who lives in a library and is about to move to Tibet.  The whole setting was silly as each of the main characters seemed to be solitary creatures without any family.  It was also never clear how she got the time off from her job as a porcelain artist to take the long trip each week. Or why the veterinarian was on the train either.  There are a lot of shots of the train and I guess this was supposed to be symbolic.  But the story was really terribly weak.I was bored throughout and I can't understand why I sat through the whole film.  I guess I was just waiting for something interesting to happen.  It didn't.

My spin is totally different. First of all, there was never a bus wreck. Chinese culture thinks and write in beautiful metaphors, and although her character did take the bus trip, it did not crash. The crash is however, the only way to describe her coming back a different and more mature person. She was no longer ""floating"", but more confident and sure of what she did not want. Basically, she did not want either of the two men she was hoping to find herself with. The most beautiful scene in the whole film is the end. After years of being tied to the rails, riding trains to meet her lovers, they show a Jeep Cherokee driving along side the train, only to turn away in a dramatic split and liberation from the rails, and her past.

855260,A2K3UTNW0783U6,B00061I29E,Phillip Kay,"[0, 0]","Zhou Yu's Train (2002) is the follow up by director Zhou Sun to his successful 2000 film Breaking the Silence. Both star Li Gong, who is both a charismatic beautiful presence in so many films and surely one of the world's great actors.A young woman, Zhou Yu (Li Gong), meets a poet called Chen Qing (Tony Leung) and falls in love with the man and his poetry. His passionate poetry reveals that he is in love with poetry, she with love itself. While visiting him in a distant city she meets a doctor who is able to reach parts of her nature she had not been aware of: his dour, cynical, pragmatic nature is in strong contrast to the introverted, shy poet she loves. How can Zhou Yu respond to both men while being true to herself? This is her journey, her train. The synopsis however can only trivialise the film.Viewers who are used to narrative structure or frenetic action sequences controlling their viewing experience need to approach this film with caution. Zhou Sun seems to agree with Picasso that asking  the right questions is far more important than finding the right answers. The film asks many questions, and is tactful enough to let the viewers find the answers for themselves. The director uses a structure whereby what events mean to the characters who experience them is far more important than the events themselves. The film tries to depict states of mind: films I am reminded of are Julio Medem's ""Lovers of the Arctic Circle"" and Ingmar Bergman's ""Persona"". While ""Zhou Yu's Train"" is not as good a film as these, the fact that the comparison can be made is high praise.At several points in the film we are shown Zhou Yu holding a book of poems written by her lover Chen Qing. The book is called Zhou Yu's Train: the director clearly comparing his film with a collection of poems. The poems are full of emotion, very romantic and saturated with landscape (as so much Chinese poetry seems to be). The poems, the cinematography by Yu Wang and the music by Shigeru Umebayashi are all just as important in achieving the effect Zhou Sun is seeking as anything that happens on screen. The music is outstanding, able to stand on its own as Zbigniew Preisner's score for Kierlowski's Dekalog did. Yu Wang's work shows that exquisite landscape is still abundant in China. The film would not work with less outstanding actors in the principal parts.An influence on Zhou Sun is surely Yasujiro Ozu, who used trains frequently to explore the situations his characters were in. Ozu was a master who could tell a whole story within just one frame and Zhou Sun is not yet as adept as this. But the shots of a train passing another going in the opposite direction is meant to tell us that here the characters who seem to interact are each going their own journey, with little chance of communicating. At times scenes are used metaphorically:  we see the car Zhou Yu is travelling in to Tibet to visit Chen Qing spiralling into a river, and hear that a bus she is travelling on has met with an accident. These tell of wasted journeys, not literal events.Is romance an ideal or an illusion? How far should we follow an ideal or an illusion? How real are the events that take place in our hearts compared to the events we experience everyday? Could love be the only experience we have that doesn't derive from our senses? Is compromise ever worthwhile? If you've ever thought of questions like these this film will move you deeply.",5,Journey without end,1193961600,"11 2, 2007",2007,3432,"['Zhou', 'Yu', 'Train', '2002', 'follow', 'up', 'director', 'Zhou', 'Sun', 'successful', '2000', 'film', 'Breaking', 'Silence', 'star', 'Li', 'Gong', 'who', 'charismatic', 'beautiful', 'presence', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'surely', 'one', 'world', 'great', 'actors.A', 'young', 'woman', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'Li', 'Gong', 'poet', 'called', 'Chen', 'Qing', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'love', 'man', 'poetry', 'passionate', 'poetry', 'reveals', 'love', 'poetry', 'love', 'visiting', 'distant', 'city', 'doctor', 'who', 'able', 'reach', 'parts', 'nature', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'aware', 'dour', 'cynical', 'pragmatic', 'nature', 'strong', 'contrast', 'introverted', 'shy', 'poet', 'How', 'can', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'respond', 'men', 'being', 'true', 'herself', 'journey', 'train', 'synopsis', 'however', 'can', 'only', 'trivialise', 'film.Viewers', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'narrative', 'structure', 'frenetic', 'action', 'sequences', 'controlling', 'viewing', 'experience', 'need', 'approach', 'film', 'caution', 'Zhou', 'Sun', 'agree', 'Picasso', 'asking', 'right', 'questions', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'finding', 'right', 'answers', 'film', 'many', 'questions', 'tactful', 'enough', 'let', 'viewers', 'find', 'answers', 'director', 'structure', 'whereby', 'what', 'events', 'mean', 'characters', 'who', 'experience', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'events', 'film', 'tries', 'depict', 'states', 'mind', 'films', 'am', 'reminded', 'are', 'Julio', 'Medem', 'Lovers', 'Arctic', 'Circle', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Persona', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'Train', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'fact', 'comparison', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'high', 'praise.At', 'several', 'points', 'film', 'are', 'shown', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'holding', 'book', 'poems', 'written', 'lover', 'Chen', 'Qing', 'book', 'called', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'Train', 'director', 'clearly', 'comparing', 'film', 'collection', 'poems', 'poems', 'are', 'full', 'emotion', 'very', 'romantic', 'saturated', 'landscape', 'so', 'much', 'Chinese', 'poetry', 'be', 'poems', 'cinematography', 'Yu', 'Wang', 'music', 'Shigeru', 'Umebayashi', 'are', 'just', 'important', 'achieving', 'effect', 'Zhou', 'Sun', 'seeking', 'anything', 'screen', 'music', 'outstanding', 'able', 'stand', 'own', 'Zbigniew', 'Preisner', 'score', 'Kierlowski', 'Dekalog', 'did', 'Yu', 'Wang', 'work', 'exquisite', 'landscape', 'still', 'abundant', 'China', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'less', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'principal', 'parts.An', 'influence', 'Zhou', 'Sun', 'surely', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'who', 'used', 'trains', 'frequently', 'explore', 'situations', 'characters', 'were', 'Ozu', 'was', 'master', 'who', 'could', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'just', 'one', 'frame', 'Zhou', 'Sun', 'not', 'yet', 'as', 'adept', 'shots', 'train', 'passing', 'going', 'opposite', 'direction', 'meant', 'tell', 'here', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'interact', 'are', 'going', 'own', 'journey', 'little', 'chance', 'communicating', 'times', 'scenes', 'are', 'used', 'metaphorically', 'see', 'car', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'travelling', 'Tibet', 'visit', 'Chen', 'Qing', 'spiralling', 'river', 'hear', 'bus', 'travelling', 'met', 'accident', 'tell', 'wasted', 'journeys', 'not', 'literal', 'events.Is', 'romance', 'ideal', 'illusion', 'How', 'far', 'should', 'follow', 'ideal', 'illusion', 'How', 'real', 'are', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'hearts', 'compared', 'events', 'experience', 'everyday', 'Could', 'love', 'be', 'only', 'experience', 'have', ""n't"", 'derive', 'senses', 'compromise', 'ever', 'worthwhile', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'thought', 'questions', 'film', 'will', 'move', 'deeply']",Zhou Yu's Train

The relationships seem to follow a similar pattern, but the degrees of passion vary dramatically.

Zhou Yu undertakes a bi-weekly train journey to meet Chen Ching. Chen Ching is a little withdrawn and is not sure if Zhou Yu likes him as a person or as a poet. This main story is knotted with another parallel story of Chen Ching's new friend who is Zhou Yu's look alike (Gong Li with shorter hair).Amidst Gong Li's beauty and all the beautiful cinematography there is subtle philosophy. The veterinarian's laid back and simple outlook is very deceptive. He has an uncanny knack of sorting out complex problems. On one occasion, Zhou Yu is desperately searching for a lake alluded to by Chen Ching's poems. The veterinarian suggests, ""If it exists in your heart, then it does exist"". Pretty Simple, Eh!The cinematography is breathtaking and the music score melodic. One of the best cinematographic shot is the veterinarian driving a manual service rail carriage along beautiful rolling hills into fading twilight with his white shirt fluttering in the breeze.Never mind the confusing story. Just come on board Zhou Yu's train and enjoy the ride.",4,Visual Extravaganza ...,1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,1448,"['Zhou', 'Yu', 'train', 'compelling', 'albeit', 'confusing', 'movie', 'movie', 'watchable', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'Gong', 'Li', 'surreal', 'beauty', 'alone', 'story', 'around', 'three', 'characters', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'gorgeous', 'dreamy', 'painter', 'who', 'head', 'heels', 'Chen', 'Ching', 'reluctant', 'disheveled', 'poet', 'living', 'old', 'library', 'distant', 'city', 'third', 'character', 'handsome', 'veterinarian', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'bi-weekly', 'train', 'journey', 'meet', 'Chen', 'Ching', 'Chen', 'Ching', 'little', 'withdrawn', 'not', 'sure', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'person', 'poet', 'main', 'story', 'knotted', 'parallel', 'story', 'Chen', 'Ching', 'new', 'friend', 'who', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'look', 'alike', 'Gong', 'Li', 'shorter', 'hair', '.Amidst', 'Gong', 'Li', 'beauty', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'subtle', 'philosophy', 'veterinarian', 'laid', 'back', 'simple', 'outlook', 'very', 'deceptive', 'uncanny', 'knack', 'sorting', 'out', 'complex', 'problems', 'one', 'occasion', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'desperately', 'searching', 'lake', 'alluded', 'Chen', 'Ching', 'poems', 'veterinarian', 'heart', 'then', 'exist', 'Pretty', 'Simple', 'Eh', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'music', 'score', 'melodic', 'One', 'best', 'cinematographic', 'shot', 'veterinarian', 'driving', 'manual', 'service', 'rail', 'carriage', 'along', 'beautiful', 'rolling', 'hills', 'fading', 'twilight', 'white', 'shirt', 'fluttering', 'breeze.Never', 'confusing', 'story', 'Just', 'come', 'board', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'train', 'enjoy', 'ride']",Zhou Yu's Train

However, it doesn't detract too much from the film unless you need some concrete plot and a linear storyline. I picked this up for two bucks in a Big Lots (sorry Amazon) and consider it a hidden gem. There is much to savor in this movie, from the controlled acting to the breathtaking scenery to the philosophical jewels scattered here and there. I think my favorite was the line ""a lover is a mirror that allows us to see who we really are"" or words to that effect - I apologize for the lack of a photographic memory. It is because of moments like these that I sat through this slow-moving tale and would do so again. This is a great movie to see with your own mate as it might provide some wonderful opportunities to chat and discover yourself in the mirror of your lover.",4,Beautiful and philosophical albeit slow and confusing,1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,918,"['read', 'reviews', 'found', 'various', 'interpretations', 'complex', 'movie', 'be', 'valid', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'believe', 'However', ""n't"", 'detract', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'need', 'concrete', 'plot', 'linear', 'storyline', 'picked', 'up', 'two', 'bucks', 'Big', 'Lots', 'sorry', 'Amazon', 'consider', 'hidden', 'gem', 'much', 'savor', 'movie', 'controlled', 'acting', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'philosophical', 'jewels', 'scattered', 'here', 'there', 'think', 'favorite', 'was', 'line', 'lover', 'mirror', 'see', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'words', 'effect', 'apologize', 'lack', 'photographic', 'memory', 'moments', 'sat', 'slow-moving', 'tale', 'would', 'do', 'so', 'again', 'great', 'movie', 'see', 'own', 'mate', 'might', 'provide', 'wonderful', 'opportunities', 'chat', 'discover', 'mirror', 'lover']",Zhou Yu's Train

855266,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,B00061I29E,The Cool Guy,"[0, 1]","This was a very beautiful movie. This movie is the type of movie that I consider to be a work of art. In some ways it reminds me a bit of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", in that the story is non-linear. Much of the time spent watching the movie is time during which you are just trying to figure out what the heck is going on. But that is a good thing, because it makes you think. This movie keeps you thinking for a long time after the movie is over.It seems like most people fall into the ""love it"" or ""hate it"" category when it comes to this movie. I really liked it. I liked the artful imagery. I liked the intricate story. I liked the metaphorical visuals that the movie uses (such as the dream where Zhou Yu plays on the train track and refuses to get off though it will kill her).However, this movie is not without its flaws. After you finally do figure the whole movie out, the story is kind of flat: A woman falls in love for unfathomable reasons with a loser who does not care for her and she subsequently refuses to leave him for the much cooler and better-looking veterinarian guy who actually does care for her. Why? I didn't get that part. That was one problem with it.Another thing that we as viewers are required to suspend disbelief on is the number of trips this woman actually takes. Could a woman with a measly job like that really take 2 train rides a week? How does she get off of work? Where does she get the money? But art wins out over logic in this case, and you just have to drop those questions.The biggest detractor in this movie (and the reason I will not give it 5 stars) is how the same actress plays two different people. That was unnecessarily confusing and complicated. It wasn't even necessary to have the other character in the movie. Having her there just keeps you wondering who the hell she is the whole time and why she looks exactly like our main woman. I guess they did it to save their budget. In any case, if you just try to ignore it, the movie is still enjoyable.",4,A Beautiful Movie,1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,2019,"['was', 'very', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'movie', 'type', 'movie', 'consider', 'be', 'work', 'art', 'ways', 'bit', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'story', 'non-linear', 'Much', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'movie', 'time', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'heck', 'going', 'good', 'thing', 'think', 'movie', 'thinking', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'over.It', 'most', 'people', 'fall', 'love', 'hate', 'category', 'when', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'liked', 'artful', 'imagery', 'liked', 'intricate', 'story', 'liked', 'metaphorical', 'visuals', 'movie', 'such', 'dream', 'where', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'train', 'track', 'get', 'off', 'will', 'kill', '.However', 'movie', 'not', 'flaws', 'finally', 'do', 'figure', 'whole', 'movie', 'story', 'kind', 'flat', 'woman', 'love', 'unfathomable', 'reasons', 'loser', 'who', 'not', 'care', 'subsequently', 'leave', 'much', 'cooler', 'better-looking', 'veterinarian', 'guy', 'who', 'actually', 'care', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'part', 'was', 'one', 'problem', 'it.Another', 'thing', 'viewers', 'are', 'required', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'number', 'trips', 'woman', 'actually', 'Could', 'woman', 'measly', 'job', 'really', 'take', '2', 'train', 'rides', 'week', 'How', 'get', 'work', 'Where', 'get', 'money', 'art', 'out', 'logic', 'case', 'just', 'have', 'drop', 'questions.The', 'biggest', 'detractor', 'movie', 'reason', 'will', 'not', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'how', 'same', 'actress', 'plays', 'two', 'different', 'people', 'was', 'unnecessarily', 'confusing', 'complicated', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'necessary', 'have', 'other', 'character', 'movie', 'Having', 'just', 'keeps', 'wondering', 'who', 'hell', 'whole', 'time', 'why', 'exactly', 'main', 'woman', 'guess', 'did', 'save', 'budget', 'case', 'just', 'try', 'ignore', 'movie', 'still', 'enjoyable']",Zhou Yu's Train
855267,A1X6M6IINHDSRC,B00061I29E,Thor,"[3, 4]","Zhou Yu's Train is one of those films that is simple, but so powerful. It is pure beauty captured on film with feeling and a grabbing story. The story and the atmosphere will pull you into the film.Zhou Yu's train takes place in northen China where it follows the story of Zhou Yu, played marvelously by Gong Li, a woman who falls in love with a shy poet. She loves him deeply and wants nothing more than his love. The only problem is that they live an one day traintrip for each other. So two days every week, Zhou Yu takes the train to be with her lover. But life is't easy and problems start to develop. She meets an animaldoctor who falls in love with her. She is attracted to him but is deeply in love with her poet. A struggle deep inside her heart begins.The locations in Northen China are so beautiful. Eyeopening landscapes let you feel the atmosphere. Also the camerastyle is one of the things that makes the film feel different. Next to those beautiful pans and steady shots, this film has some unsteady shots that put you right into it. It helps you to feel the story. Sometimes I had the feeling I was there, right next to the characters. It gives you pure realism.The music in the film is gorgeous and makes you feel the story as well. The theme is wonderful and will stay in your head for some time. Even though music is present in quite a few scenes, mostly you just hear the sounds of the surroundings which also gives pleasant realism to the film.Considering casting this film is a true masterpiece. The beautiful Gong Li acts so powerful, that with one glance of her eyes you will know how she feels. She is the one who carries the movie and makes it work.The film is a slowpaced, may it be simple, but oh so powerful story about love and will. It feels like a romantic mystery. And I am happy to have explored it. I am blown away by it's simple and beautiful power. It is an emotional journey through the heart of a normal woman.This film is one of the proves that China can give so much more than just epic Martial Arts films. Sometimes one of these little masterpieces comes along.See for yourself and drift away with Zhou Yu on her train of Love.",5,Simple Beauty Captured on Film,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,2169,"['Zhou', 'Yu', 'Train', 'one', 'films', 'simple', 'so', 'powerful', 'pure', 'beauty', 'captured', 'film', 'feeling', 'grabbing', 'story', 'story', 'atmosphere', 'will', 'pull', 'film.Zhou', 'Yu', 'train', 'place', 'northen', 'China', 'where', 'story', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'played', 'marvelously', 'Gong', 'Li', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'shy', 'poet', 'deeply', 'nothing', 'more', 'love', 'only', 'problem', 'live', 'one', 'day', 'traintrip', 'other', 'So', 'two', 'days', 'week', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'train', 'be', 'lover', 'life', ""is't"", 'easy', 'problems', 'start', 'develop', 'animaldoctor', 'who', 'love', 'attracted', 'deeply', 'love', 'poet', 'struggle', 'deep', 'heart', 'begins.The', 'locations', 'Northen', 'China', 'are', 'so', 'beautiful', 'Eyeopening', 'landscapes', 'let', 'feel', 'atmosphere', 'Also', 'camerastyle', 'one', 'things', 'film', 'feel', 'different', 'Next', 'beautiful', 'pans', 'steady', 'shots', 'film', 'unsteady', 'shots', 'put', 'right', 'feel', 'story', 'Sometimes', 'had', 'feeling', 'was', 'there', 'right', 'next', 'characters', 'pure', 'realism.The', 'music', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'feel', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'theme', 'wonderful', 'will', 'stay', 'head', 'time', 'Even', 'music', 'present', 'quite', 'few', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'just', 'hear', 'sounds', 'surroundings', 'also', 'pleasant', 'realism', 'film.Considering', 'casting', 'film', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'beautiful', 'Gong', 'Li', 'so', 'powerful', 'one', 'glance', 'eyes', 'will', 'know', 'how', 'one', 'who', 'movie', 'work.The', 'film', 'slowpaced', 'may', 'be', 'simple', 'oh', 'so', 'powerful', 'story', 'love', 'will', 'romantic', 'mystery', 'am', 'happy', 'have', 'explored', 'am', 'blown', 'away', 'simple', 'beautiful', 'power', 'emotional', 'journey', 'heart', 'normal', 'woman.This', 'film', 'one', 'proves', 'China', 'can', 'give', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'epic', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'films', 'Sometimes', 'one', 'little', 'masterpieces', 'along.See', 'drift', 'away', 'Zhou', 'Yu', 'train', 'Love']",Zhou Yu's Train
