706661,A1EI65WJC85U68,B0000694X8,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[0, 1]","24 HOURS IN LONDON is set in London (obviously) in 2009, where a sexy female doctor is seducing men and then drugging them to steal their organs (Not THAT one!) for sale on the black market along with (of course) drugs. Her trail is pursued by a pair of corrupt police officers whose idea of fun is blowing things up. Ironic, considering this movie comes within a hair's breadth of being a certified BOMB.Written and directed by Alexander Finbow, 24 HOURS IN LONDON attempts to be flashy; but for half its duration the movie's mis-en-scene looks like it was purposely designed to make viewers feel like they're intoxicated- and if you genuinely ARE while watching this, then lucky you. Finbow's script appears to have been written just to please himself, because not many others will be. Add to this a soundtrack loaded with thumping techno music that amounts to nothing more than a 90 minute assault on the eardrums, and the only real organ stolen is the viewer's brain. It only gets 2 stars because I've seen far worse (Ever seen NAIL GUN MASSACRE or ANDY WARHOL'S TRASH?). The DVD also includes the trailer. Watch that first in order to discern if your really want to subject yourself to the torture of watching this movie. My ""funny, sexy, clever"" comment comes from some UK reviewer whose comments are on the DVD cover. It's probably safe to assume that Finbow blew a large chunk of the movie's budget paying this critic to say something nice about his movie. If he was paying ME I'd take the money, but I'd still trash his movie. I'm one of those guys who can't give anything other than his honest opinion, sorry to say. There is however, a memorable bit where a guy gets acid thrown in his face, resulting in a gruesome R-rated melting scene even the G-rated Wicked Witch Of The West would be proud of.",2,"Funny, sexy and clever.

I also don't know if he directed this or had some role in its creation.  Still, if you like crime thrillers in the UK with a racially and sexually diverse cast, then you'll recognize his style in this.I would say that in the US interracial couples are still taboo, which is a shame in a land that bases itself on freedom.  I'd say most American films don't show interracial couples that often.  However, this film had about three interracial pairs.  Perhaps the British are more tolerant and supportive than on this side of the pond.There are a lot of double-crosses in this film.  On the one hand, it gives the viewers surprises.  I also wonder if this is the East Asian influence on this work.  After awhile, however, the double-crosses get confusing.  You almost grow to expect them.  It starts to make no sense, and not even be important, who lives or who is aligned with whom.This movie didn't knock my socks off, but I didn't want to smash it with a hammer either.

I was expecting fast, edge of your seat action where there are 20 varying plots and it takes a genious to figure out how it all works and if you pay attention it all pulls together brilliantly.  I enjoyed the two named movies with such enthusiasm that I was expecting the same genre to pay off.  It opened well with the whole Kidney stealing gag but then it took off into a music video and then some guy gets his throat cut and before you know it there is a witness that must survive for 24 hours in london.  There are two dweebs that think that take on a hallway full of armed police (covered in heavy swat gear might I add) with only BODY armor no head gear.  They step out of an elevator that is spins they have already killed three people? in the precint and the cops say ""Drop your weapons."" are you kidding me?  I am sorry but I couldn't take any more especially when the two dweebs started shooting out the light fixtures and some how managed to his a few cops right in the neck - which is the only area that is exposed but only slightly.  OH! and did I mention that there is a worm in the police station? - who leaked out that a witness had survived a bloody mid london massacre?  See, here is where the other two movies would have taken it beyond the realm of the expected.No one would have known that the lady existed.  She would have survived but only after she was discovered at the precint would they have realized she was the witness - or better yet - Christian's brother or family memeber takes revenge on the lady after everyone was killed in a hold up by the cops.

Varnau ""nerff20""","[0, 0]","Of the direct-to-video flicks that City Heat Productions has distributed, I'd say ""24 Hours in London"" is probably one of their best.

The main plot concerns a British gangster, Christian, after a lady squealer who is being protected by the cops. On the way we meet henchmen Tony and Bubbles. The film has some neat action and an inspired script. The acting is standard for low-rent films. I liked the character of Bubbles. The actor who played him did a nice job of bringing him to life.
