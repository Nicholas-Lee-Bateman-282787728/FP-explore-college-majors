1277270,A3EZEP0FX5BC1P,B002LVVCJY,"A Conrad ""Ask Conrad""","[3, 4]","In his directorial debut, Academy Award winner Philip Seymour Hoffman also stars as the shy and simple Jack.  Bob Glaudini adapted his acclaimed off-broadway play for this movie, where Hoffman reprised his role on stage.Set in New York City, Jack drives a limo for his uncle.  Jack's sole friends, Clyde and Lucy, have their own problems and ambiguities.  They set up Jack on a blind date with Connie (Amy Ryan) that ignites a narrative comprised of a series of drab superfluous occurrences.  The underlying theme seems to be misery and monotony.  Jack and Connie are two uncommitted single individuals with their own personal and social issues, and are unconsciously yet successfully withdrawing into the urban background of anonymity.  Together and in each other they discover the desire to begin a burgeoning relationship.  Ironically, the friends who brought them together are battling the crisis of a failing and unsettled marriage.So, Jack goes boating because... well, I suppose I shouldn't spoil it here.  Let's just say he wants to rise above his fears and deficiencies.  He overcomes his fear of water, as well as his lack of skills in the kitchen, in the very basic interest of self-improvement.  Oh, and he also wants to impress his newfound love interest.Love and friendship, lies and betrayal, achievement and collapse.  ""Jack Goes Boating"" is casually situated in a slice of working-class New York City life.  The writing and acting is brutally genuine.  Hoffman demonstrates his versatile talents behind the camera and in front of it.  Quixotic and exquisite, the movie is an informal tale of love that comes and goes like a snowflake in winter.  Depending on your taste, you will either hate it or appreciate it.Highly recommended.",4,A slice of working class life in New York City,1296432000,"01 31, 2011",2011,1748,"['directorial', 'debut', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'also', 'shy', 'simple', 'Jack', 'Bob', 'Glaudini', 'adapted', 'acclaimed', 'off-broadway', 'play', 'movie', 'where', 'Hoffman', 'reprised', 'role', 'stage.Set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Jack', 'limo', 'uncle', 'Jack', 'sole', 'friends', 'Clyde', 'Lucy', 'have', 'own', 'problems', 'ambiguities', 'set', 'up', 'Jack', 'blind', 'date', 'Connie', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'narrative', 'comprised', 'series', 'drab', 'superfluous', 'occurrences', 'underlying', 'theme', 'be', 'misery', 'monotony', 'Jack', 'Connie', 'are', 'two', 'uncommitted', 'single', 'individuals', 'own', 'personal', 'social', 'issues', 'are', 'unconsciously', 'yet', 'successfully', 'withdrawing', 'urban', 'background', 'anonymity', 'Together', 'other', 'discover', 'desire', 'begin', 'burgeoning', 'relationship', 'Ironically', 'friends', 'who', 'brought', 'together', 'are', 'battling', 'crisis', 'failing', 'unsettled', 'marriage.So', 'Jack', 'boating', 'well', 'suppose', 'should', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'rise', 'fears', 'deficiencies', 'fear', 'water', 'as', 'well', 'lack', 'skills', 'kitchen', 'very', 'basic', 'interest', 'self-improvement', 'Oh', 'also', 'impress', 'newfound', 'love', 'interest.Love', 'friendship', 'betrayal', 'achievement', 'collapse', 'Jack', 'Goes', 'Boating', 'casually', 'situated', 'slice', 'working-class', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'life', 'writing', 'acting', 'brutally', 'genuine', 'Hoffman', 'versatile', 'talents', 'camera', 'front', 'Quixotic', 'exquisite', 'movie', 'informal', 'tale', 'love', 'snowflake', 'winter', 'Depending', 'taste', 'will', 'either', 'hate', 'appreciate', 'it.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

I love romance movies, so when I read that it was about two people looking for love and being set up with each other by friends, I was excited about watching it. As I began to watch it, it became more and more difficult to keep track of the actual plot. There was a lot of going from seeing inside the thoughts of Jack to seeing what was going on while watching his thoughts. I did not appreciate the purchase of drugs or the use of them being shown in the movie.

At most, it's whimsical at times, and fits more into the category of ""socially-awkward-people-in-love"". But there's as much drama as there is comedy here, especially in the relationship between Jack's best friends, Clyde and Lucy.  That said, the best thing about this film is the relationship between Jack, a taciturn and mopey limo driver, and Connie, a mousy telemarketer who works for a kind of motivational speaker with Lucy.  There is an awkward sweetness in their developing relationship that might remind you of some classic films like ""Marty"", and their connection becomes all the more poignant as they literally watch their friends' marriage fall apart. Needless to day, Hoffman and Ryan are two of the best actors working today, and they make this a movie worth watching. Hoffman, by the way, is a very capable director of this character-driven film.  The soundtrack is also very good, featuring indie-music favorites like Grizzly Bear and Fleet Foxes.

1277276,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B002LVVCJY,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[1, 1]","I enjoyed ""Jack Goes Boating,"" and oddly enough, so did my wife who usually has difficulty with movies like this.  Movies like this?  I mean movies that are produced with absolutely no commercial ""hooks.""  No beautiful people (with the exception of Amy Ryan, and even she is atypical), no obvious plot, relatively few cliches, and very few easy scenes.  ""Boating"" is loaded with ambiguity, untidiness, and complexity, and we are consistently challenged to figure out what is going on locally and universally throughout the film.OK, so why did we like it?  Hoffman and Ryan are brilliant together.  A good portion of the action, or non-action as the case may be, centers on the faces of these fine actors as they cope with events in their lives.  Hoffman's reactions are so slow and intense.  Is Mona Lisa smiling?  Da Vinci isn't around to tell us, and we can't ask Hoffman.  His facial expressions are marvelous, but early in the film we wonder whether Jack is emotionally or mentally slow.  As time passes we begin to understand that Jack's feelings are intense, and he is just fearful and struggling  with what he feels.  Likewise, Amy Ryan's Connie character is dealing with all kinds of life problems and she appears to be justifyably afraid of everything.  Yet as the story unfolds we come to understand these two characters are actually very courageous, ambitious, thoughtful, and sweet.  My wife and I developed great affection for them by the time the film was over.We loved the story.  Its was adapted from a stage play, and Hoffman's direction pays tribute to its past.  But Hoffman the director is obviously thrilled to be shooting in New York.  There is a brief segment in the DVD ""extras"" where the actors talk about how great it was to film in New York, how great New York is, etc. etc.  Agreed, New York is critical to the impact of ""Boating."" But the New York shot in this film is dark, intimidating, dangerious, dirty, and overwhelmingly lonely.  This has the very important impact of further isolating the main characters, and intensifying their courage and the warmth of their love.We liked the complexity of the characters.  Clyde is Jack's best friend and fellow limosine driver, and the scenes where he teaches Jack to swim in the ancient YMCA pool (wonderful scene selection and filming) are marvelous.  Lucy, Clyde's wife, helps Connie at the mortuary and assists Jack while he grocery shops.  Yet these kind and generous people are also bitterly cruel, and unfaithful to each other.  As the relationship between Clyde and Lucy falls apart, we watch the relationship of Jack and Connie catch hold and survive on its own.There are special scenes that stand out.  Connie, realizing her job is hanging by a thread, closes a phone deal while bleeding from the nose after a subway assault. The visualization scenes, when Jack and Connie are imagining what they want to happen were well done.  The first scene in the YMCA pool when Jack is learning to swim, including the underwater shots and those goggles.  The scene in the hospital bed when Jack visits Connie. And of course, the fabulous crescendo dinner party, where everyone is high, dinnerware and smoke alarms are attacked and destroyed, and three of the four characters spend some time in the bathroom fleeing the caos.Its not perfect, but the imperfections in ""Boating"" generally serve to enhance the experience and reinforce the reality.  I probably would have toned down Jack's violent and angry reaction to burning dinner.  It didn't seem to fit Jack's otherwise peaceful and goodness seeking character.  There are plenty of times when the viewer is left (for a few moments) to wonder where its all heading, and there are a few times when just looking at Hoffman's face doesn't add much value to the art.But overall, ""Boating"" an interesting study in character, and a very worthy departure from all the commercial schlock that sells all the popcorn and fills all the theatre seats.",5,The Phil Hoffman Experience,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,3963,"['enjoyed', 'Jack', 'Goes', 'Boating', 'oddly', 'enough', 'so', 'did', 'wife', 'who', 'usually', 'difficulty', 'movies', 'Movies', 'mean', 'movies', 'are', 'produced', 'absolutely', 'commercial', 'hooks', 'beautiful', 'people', 'exception', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'even', 'atypical', 'obvious', 'plot', 'relatively', 'few', 'cliches', 'very', 'few', 'easy', 'scenes', 'Boating', 'loaded', 'ambiguity', 'untidiness', 'complexity', 'are', 'consistently', 'challenged', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'locally', 'universally', 'film.OK', 'so', 'why', 'did', 'like', 'Hoffman', 'Ryan', 'are', 'brilliant', 'together', 'good', 'portion', 'action', 'non-action', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'centers', 'fine', 'actors', 'cope', 'events', 'lives', 'Hoffman', 'reactions', 'are', 'so', 'slow', 'intense', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'smiling', 'Da', 'Vinci', ""n't"", 'around', 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Hoffman', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'marvelous', 'early', 'film', 'wonder', 'Jack', 'emotionally', 'mentally', 'slow', 'time', 'begin', 'understand', 'Jack', 'feelings', 'are', 'intense', 'just', 'fearful', 'struggling', 'what', 'Likewise', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'Connie', 'character', 'dealing', 'kinds', 'life', 'problems', 'be', 'justifyably', 'afraid', 'everything', 'story', 'come', 'understand', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'courageous', 'ambitious', 'thoughtful', 'sweet', 'wife', 'developed', 'great', 'affection', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'over.We', 'loved', 'story', 'was', 'adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'Hoffman', 'direction', 'tribute', 'past', 'Hoffman', 'director', 'obviously', 'thrilled', 'be', 'shooting', 'New', 'York', 'brief', 'segment', 'DVD', 'extras', 'where', 'actors', 'talk', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'how', 'great', 'New', 'York', 'etc', 'etc', 'Agreed', 'New', 'York', 'critical', 'impact', 'Boating', 'New', 'York', 'shot', 'film', 'dark', 'intimidating', 'dangerious', 'dirty', 'overwhelmingly', 'lonely', 'very', 'important', 'impact', 'further', 'isolating', 'main', 'characters', 'intensifying', 'courage', 'warmth', 'love.We', 'liked', 'complexity', 'characters', 'Clyde', 'Jack', 'best', 'friend', 'fellow', 'limosine', 'driver', 'scenes', 'where', 'Jack', 'swim', 'ancient', 'YMCA', 'pool', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'selection', 'filming', 'are', 'marvelous', 'Lucy', 'Clyde', 'wife', 'Connie', 'mortuary', 'assists', 'Jack', 'shops', 'kind', 'generous', 'people', 'are', 'also', 'bitterly', 'cruel', 'unfaithful', 'other', 'relationship', 'Clyde', 'Lucy', 'apart', 'watch', 'relationship', 'Jack', 'Connie', 'catch', 'hold', 'survive', 'are', 'special', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'Connie', 'realizing', 'job', 'hanging', 'thread', 'phone', 'deal', 'bleeding', 'nose', 'subway', 'assault', 'visualization', 'scenes', 'when', 'Jack', 'Connie', 'are', 'imagining', 'what', 'want', 'happen', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'first', 'scene', 'YMCA', 'pool', 'when', 'Jack', 'learning', 'swim', 'including', 'underwater', 'shots', 'goggles', 'scene', 'hospital', 'bed', 'when', 'Jack', 'Connie', 'course', 'fabulous', 'crescendo', 'dinner', 'party', 'where', 'everyone', 'high', 'dinnerware', 'smoke', 'alarms', 'are', 'attacked', 'destroyed', 'three', 'four', 'characters', 'spend', 'time', 'bathroom', 'fleeing', 'caos.Its', 'not', 'perfect', 'imperfections', 'Boating', 'generally', 'serve', 'enhance', 'experience', 'reinforce', 'reality', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'toned', 'down', 'Jack', 'violent', 'angry', 'reaction', 'burning', 'dinner', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'Jack', 'otherwise', 'peaceful', 'goodness', 'seeking', 'character', 'are', 'plenty', 'times', 'when', 'viewer', 'left', 'few', 'moments', 'wonder', 'where', 'heading', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'just', 'looking', 'Hoffman', 'face', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'value', 'art.But', 'overall', 'Boating', 'interesting', 'study', 'character', 'very', 'worthy', 'departure', 'commercial', 'schlock', 'popcorn', 'theatre', 'seats']",N/A

The denial and lack of love is painful to watch, while Jack's hopefulness and devotion are truly touching.

1277280,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B002LVVCJY,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","Jack Goes Boating is an intimate view of two couples in New York City.Jack and Clyde are two limo drivers. Clyde is married to Lucy who works for Dr. Bob a self help guru. Jack is socially inept; he spends a lot of time with Lucy and Clyde. Lucy sets up Jack with a new person at her office, Connie. The two are quickly attracted to each other. Jack promises Connie they will go boating in Central Park in a few months when it gets warmer. Jack can't swim, so Clyde teaches him how to swim.Very gradually we get to know the four characters. Jack loves reggae music, it makes him happy. Connie has trouble getting people to commit in her sales job. Lucy is a free spirit. Clyde is much more complicated than his smooth talking handsome guy exterior.Because the film is so intimate, there are uncomfortable moments, sometimes feeling like too much is revealed.Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Jack and directs his first film. His acting is incredible; he has an amazing talent for playing a character with exactly the right amount of or lack of emotion. There is a subtle confidence I hadn't seen in his previous roles in Capote (Capote), The Big LebowskiThe Big Lebowski), Almost Famous (Almost Famous), or Doubt (Doubt). Directing his first film, he displays a maturity not seen in more seasoned directors. The pacing of this film is nearly perfect. First time directors usually think things have to happen quickly in a film, pauses are a bad thing. Young musicians just learning how to play are victims of playing the notes too fast. Hoffman knows how to let the notes play out until you have heard the whole note; he allows just the right amount of time at the end of an edit to understand exactly what happened, to absorb the moment.Amy Ryan plays Connie in a quirky, loving, innocent manner. Amy Ryan has appeared on The Office as Holly Flax, Michael's love interest. John Ortiz and Daphne Rubin-Vega round out the excellent main cast.At almost and hour and a half, the film feels about the right length even though it moves along at a nice slow pace. Sequences that would normally be handled with one or two shots, are cut into three, four or five shots; giving a sense that not as much time has passed. The first three quarters feel like a film, there is no sense that this was originally a stage play converted to a film. The last half hour, where the four people spend the climax of the film in Clyde and Lucy's apartment, feels somewhat theatrical. There is a very realistic, for New York apartments, claustrophobia. I was reminded of the movie Marty - not much happens, but emotions run very high.The cinematography is excellent. From the bonus features, the movie was filmed in actual small New York apartments. To achieve the look of this film had to be extremely difficult in these miniscule apartments. The color of the pool is amazing. The blue green water and Philip Seymour Hoffman's light colored body are a wonderful contrast.The film is rated R for strong language and drug use. The F bomb is thrown around frequently, although this is not unusual for New York City. There are several scenes of people smoking marijuana and taking cocaine. There is no nudity, although there is an intimate scene with a woman in lingerie and a man caresses her breasts. It is possible that a mature younger viewer would find this film acceptable.The DVD includes two very short deleted scenes that were gratefully removed from the film and should remain on the cutting room floor. A short segment on how the producer wanted to create a more realistic view of New York City. And a piece about how the stage play was adapted to a film.

The latter couple seem happy in themselves, and make it their life's work to bring the former together.  This is no easy task: Jack has little or no self-esteem, while Connie shies away from all contact, whether physical or social.  Eventually Connie and Jack are brought together in a climactic dinner-party scene, where Jack has managed to cook an entire meal from scratch, despite being a non-cook.  However the course of true love never did run smooth: during this scene we discover that Clyde and Lucy are not quite as stable in their relationship as we had first assumed.  JACK GOES BOATING is a modest film, the directorial debut of Philip Seymour Hoffman.  The style is relentlessly character-focused: Hoffman's camera gives us little respite from focusing on the varying emotions of the four protagonists.  Sometimes there's a problem with tone: we are not sure whether the film is trying to be funny as it lays the characters' shortcomings bare for our perusal.

Boy was I in for a surprise! To be sure, it was different, just not in a good way. Had the film been more aptly titled (something like ""Jack Goes to Sleep"" or even ""Jill Had the Good Sense to Clear Out Long Before They Made This Turkey""), a couple hours of my life that I will never get back certainly would have been better spent.Dull character, dull dialogue and - spoiler alert! - dull plot. In your typical romantic comedy, you KNOW the guy is going to get the girl in the end, but the whole reason for watching is finding out how the two overcome numerous and improbable difficulties to become one in the forgone conclusion. Now don't get me wrong, the last thing the world needs is ANOTHER romcom; I'm merely pointing out that formula does produce the occasional flick worth watching. ""Jack Goes Boating"" messes with that formula on several levels. It's short on both romance and comedy, and long on, well, being long. Middle-aged and dysfunctional Connie is frigid in a lukewarm sort of way. Her paramour, the middle-aged and dysfunctional Jack, is socially inept and sports the homeless look, which is curious, considering his profession as a limo driver. Early in the movie, Jack hooks up with Connie, and there's never any reason for them to break up, so they don't. That's the story, with some padding and a subplot not worth going into here. Really, the whole thing could have been comfortably fit into a 90-second trailer. To beef up this paltry scrap into a full-length feature, the filmmakers show Jack learning how to swim and taking cooking lessons. One action-packed scene has Jack filling out a job application AND submitting it to a prospective employer! In the spirit of public service, the fimmakers use ""Jack Goes Boating"" as a vehicle to point out the rather obvious - an unintended consequence of drug use can include burnt casserole. Perhaps most surprisingly, our new couple overcomes their sexual difficulties when Connie talks Jack into raping her! I know, I know, I know, it sounds crazy (but it's true, smoking hash really can be the death of an otherwise perfectly good dinner).And that, folks, is ""Jack Goes Boating."" Problem is, my review makes the movie sound more interesting than it really is.Somewhere in ""Jack Goes Boating"" there probably is some good filmmaking and solid acting. I just couldn't find either  in this movie that ran aground, went dead in the water and got lost at sea simultaneously. Next time you're at the video store, save yourself a few bucks (and a couple hours of your life you'll never get back) by passing this up and experience something a little more meaningful, entertaining and moving.

It includes all the clich&eacute;s of this type of film: friends to the rescue, friends causing trouble, couples in turmoil, couples in love, outside influences crashing in, and outside influences supporting and effecting the unlikely. Some of the things that work in this movie: Philip Seymour Hoffman, who gets to play an unsuccessful but impassioned ""average guy"", the soundtrack, which uses a wonderful Bill Evans track (fromEverybody Digs Bill Evans: Keepnews Collection) to set the ending mood, and a hot chick with back tattoos in black lingerie (Daphne Rubin-Vega). Some of the things that don't work in this movie: the forced stereotypes, the overall creepiness of all the male actors, the forced profundity when Hoffman's character (who is learning to swim) watches a man with no legs take a swimming lesson, and Hoffman's eyebrows, which change color, shape and distance from each other in every scene.

With a very small cast, very little dialogue, slow movement, and stuttered sound this little film slowly unravels a story about reconstructing tenuous lives for two awkward and damaged people who wrongly place their role models in the personas of pathological people.  Robert Glaudini wrote the play on which this film is based and then thankfully wrote the screenplay for its transfer to film.  Philip Seymour Hoffman produces, directs and stars, and once again proving he is an artist of great dramatic range.Jack (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an obese, socially inept limousine driver who tunes out the world by wearing earphones to his recorded reggae music. He wants something better, even if that is driving for MTA, but he is buried in the paperwork and bureaucracy.  His fellow limo driver is Clyde (Jack Ortiz) who is married to  Lucy (Daphne Rubin-Vega) who works for a mortuary run by Dr Bob (Thomas McCarthy) who gives seminars on life that require telemarketing.  There is a very plain new girl telemarketer Connie (Amy Ryan) with deep-seated issues of her own  who faces being fired for being inept until a subway altercation increases her fortitude and she starts closing deals in her job.  Clyde sets up Jack with Connie but with his lack of relationship skills almost blunders the setup.  In the middle of winter Jack promises Connie that they will be dating by summer when Jack can take her boating.  Clyde teaches the inept Jack how to swim, Lucy encourages Connie to take Jack seriously, and Jack accidentally promises Connie he will make dinner for her - something that really makes Connie trust Jack and find him desirable.  Jack takes cooking lessons from Cannoli (Salvatore Inzerillo, a chef we soon discover Lucy has had affairs with) and with the swimming lessons preparing Jack for boating and the cooking lessons at Lucy and Clyde's apartment (Jack lives in his father's basement with only a hot plate!), the preparations for Jack and Connie to become connected are set.  But very soon Jack learns from Clyde that Lucy is unfaithful, Lucy lets Jack know that Clyde has been unfaithful and when the time comes for Jack and Connie to have the 'dinner' with Lucy and Clyde, a volcanic reaction occurs , changing all the preparations in many ways.  The interaction of the quartet of players show that life is a series of love, betrayal, friendship and grace. The manner in which the 'teaching couple' and the 'learning couple' find each other is both tender and pathetic - a balance that each of the quartet of players plays with aplomb.Hoffman takes Glaudini's play to new heights and the result is  film that is insightful in the say it opens our eyes to the microstories that surround us.

1277294,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B002LVVCJY,J. B. Hoyos,"[6, 7]","Jack is a lonely New York limo driver.  His coworker and best friend, Clyde, wants him to date Connie who works as a telephone solicitor with his wife Lucy at a successful mortuary.  Jack promises to cook dinner for Connie and take her boating in Central Park in the summer.  With Clyde's help, Jack spends all winter learning how to swim and cook a gourmet meal.  Ironically, Clyde's marriage to Lucy is crumbling due to past marital indiscretions.Most viewers may perceive Jack (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as an underachiever or a loser, but I saw him as a gentle, kindhearted man who was always too shy to ask a girl out on a date.  In steps the handsome, suave Clyde (John Ortiz) to help him woo the cute, highly imaginative Connie (Amy Ryan).  Unfortunately, Clyde doesn't have enough moral fortitude to be faithful to his own gorgeous, incredibly sensuous wife Lucy (Daphne Rubin-Vega).  One can't help but wonder why Jack is trying desperately to build a relationship while watching his best friend's disintegrate.  In the end, the two couples are like boats passing in the night.  Jack and Connie are sailing towards a glorious sunrise while Clyde and Lucy or sailing in the opposite direction towards darkness and destruction produced by alcohol, drug abuse and infidelity.At this point, from reading my review, one can ascertain that ""Jack Goes Boating"" is not a romantic comedy.  It is not the type of film to watch when one is depressed; it may push the viewer over the edge.  Don't watch it before getting married; you may change your mind.  ""Jack Goes Boating"" is too serious and dramatic for it to be a comedy.  I don't remember laughing out loud once during the film.  There is some drug usage and crazy talk that some might find funny but the tragic consequences weren't.Perhaps this film would've been more appropriately marketed as an inspirational drama.  Despite tragic circumstances, Jack preservers until he finally dates Connie.  He never gives up.  Frankly, I would be thrilled if someone spent months learning how to cook and how to swim in order to impress me.  Jack isn't the most handsome or intelligent man I've encountered but he has warm, sincere inner qualities that make him adorable.  Jack represents every man or woman who thinks they don't have the qualities necessary to find love.""Jack Goes Boating"" has heart.  It made me step back and appreciate the love that I have in my life - the love of family and friends.  Finding love, as well as maintaining love, can be a challenge and a miracle.  Jack was determined to find love.  He risked the fear of drowning in order to achieve it.  Philip Seymour Hoffman gave an excellent performance as Jack.  In fact, the acting from all the leads was superb.  Kudos to Hoffman for directing ""Jack Goes Boating.""  The photography was excellent.  Most of the film takes place during late winter.  Some of the scenes, with the snow falling, were beautiful, making me wish I was there.  The scenes inside the grand hotel were lavish.  At the very end of the film, warm weather has arrived and the viewer is given a glimpse of Central Park, specifically the lake upon which Jack takes Connie boating.I love watching beautiful rich people fall in love in those silly, unrealistic romantic comedies.  They are a great way to escape my everyday problems.  However, even I get tired of those and yearn for a more realistic film involving normal people who are barely making it from one day to the next.  ""Jack Goes Boating"" is such a film, which provides hope for us ""little people.""  If Jack can go boating, then so can I.  This film is highly recommended for fans of the versatile actor (and now director), Philip Seymour Hoffman, and for fans of realistic, emotional dramas that aren't afraid to depict the world as it truly is.Joseph B.

1277295,A343CRJ1JDE6RP,B002LVVCJY,"J. M. Jacobs ""Just one man's opinion...""","[1, 3]","Wow. I'm kind of stunned here.Philip Seymour Hoffman was one of the Executive Producers plus he directed and starred in this movie. Robert Glaudini, the screenwriter, is listed on IMDB as having this be his FIRST screenplay and it is an excellent initial effort. If it wasn't, I don't think Mr. Hoffman would have been involved as a director. His history indicates that he didn't seem to be in the habit of lending his efforts to B-Squad material.This is a dialogue driven movie about two socially awkward people who go out on a blind date. In looking back, I can't exactly say they 'hit it off' but they got along well enough to try another one.There's humor here in their interaction but it's in the form of pathos to be sure. It's almost hard to watch at times... you just want to help them out a little, you know? They're both nice enough people that you want to see them get together in the end.Back to Mr. Hoffman as actor... when I think back on some of this movies I've seen and also own - Capote, Doubt, The Invention of Lying, Charlie Wilson's War, The Talented Mr. Ripley and even Patch Adams - we're talking a huge range here. I think that here in his role as Jack, opposite Amy Ryan as Connie, he stretches that range a little more. This is a very different character for him to play and all through the movie I kept thinking to myself... ""THIS is Philip Seymour Hoffman?!!!"" His work here will turn your head around, for sure, if you harbor any preconceptions on just what roles he might have chosen to play.I would recommend this movie very highly for it's solid material across the board.Cinematography is very complementary to the overall atmosphere, costuming is 'spot on' as the Brits say, lighting is just about perfect considering the vast majority of this movie happens indoors, the acting and the interplay between the four main characters, use of camera angles to accent emotional drivers.... this one is right up there when it comes to being a quality film you could watch several times and not get bored with it.So if you've ever enjoyed Mr. Hoffman in a performance, give this one a spin. You'll be rewarded for the investment of time spent with an intelligent, engaging film, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised as well.",5,Philip Seymour Hoffman... at the top of his game,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,2255,"['Wow', ""'m"", 'kind', 'stunned', 'here.Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'one', 'Executive', 'Producers', 'directed', 'starred', 'movie', 'Robert', 'Glaudini', 'screenwriter', 'listed', 'IMDB', 'having', 'be', 'FIRST', 'screenplay', 'excellent', 'initial', 'effort', 'was', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Mr.', 'Hoffman', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'director', 'history', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'habit', 'lending', 'efforts', 'B-Squad', 'material.This', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'movie', 'two', 'socially', 'awkward', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'out', 'blind', 'date', 'looking', 'back', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'say', ""'hit"", 'off', 'got', 'along', 'well', 'enough', 'try', 'one.There', 'humor', 'here', 'interaction', 'form', 'pathos', 'be', 'sure', 'almost', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'just', 'want', 'help', 'out', 'little', 'know', ""'re"", 'nice', 'enough', 'people', 'want', 'see', 'get', 'together', 'end.Back', 'Mr.', 'Hoffman', 'actor', 'when', 'think', 'back', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'also', 'own', 'Capote', 'Doubt', 'Invention', 'Lying', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'even', 'Patch', 'Adams', ""'re"", 'talking', 'huge', 'range', 'here', 'think', 'here', 'role', 'Jack', 'opposite', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'Connie', 'range', 'little', 'more', 'very', 'different', 'character', 'play', 'movie', 'kept', 'thinking', 'myself', 'THIS', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'work', 'here', 'will', 'turn', 'head', 'sure', 'harbor', 'preconceptions', 'just', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'chosen', 'play.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'very', 'highly', 'solid', 'material', 'board.Cinematography', 'very', 'complementary', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'costuming', ""'spot"", 'Brits', 'say', 'lighting', 'just', 'perfect', 'considering', 'vast', 'majority', 'movie', 'indoors', 'acting', 'interplay', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'use', 'camera', 'angles', 'accent', 'emotional', 'drivers', 'one', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'when', 'being', 'quality', 'film', 'could', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'not', 'get', 'bored', 'it.So', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'enjoyed', 'Mr.', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'give', 'one', 'spin', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded', 'investment', 'time', 'spent', 'intelligent', 'engaging', 'film', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'as', 'well']",N/A

1277297,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B002LVVCJY,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 1]","I desperately wanted to love Jack Goes Boating, the directorial debut of Oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman. This is a film that I've been eagerly waiting to see since I first saw the trailer for it and now that I've watched it I'm met it with near indifference. That may be the film's biggest problem. Once it ended, I struggled to describe my feelings about it.Hoffman plays Jack, a shy, unmarried man who is a limo driver for his uncle. His friend Clyde (John Ortiz) sets him up on a blind date with Connie (Amy Ryan), who works with Clyde's wife Lucy (Daphne Rubin-Vega) at a mortuary. It is winter in New York, but Connie mentions that once summer arrives she'd like to go boating. Jack doesn't know how to swim, so Clyde offers to help him. After Connie is attacked on a subway, Jack wants to cook for her. Jack doesn't know how to cook.And so you have the basic plot of Jack Goes Boating. The film is based on a play by Robert Glaudini, who adapted his play for the screen, and its stage origins are apparent throughout the film. While it's being called a romance, a comedy, and/or a drama; I think it's more of a dramatic character piece. Remarkably little occurs in the actual film as it's more about what happens to the characters in the film.With the exception of Amy Ryan, the core cast is reprising roles they originated onstage and they're all very comfortable with these characters. Hoffman has mastered playing awkward men with no self-confidence and, as Jack you find yourself rooting for him to succeed. Ortiz does a great job as Clyde, portraying a character whose inability to forgive (or at least, forget) causes significant strain on his marriage. Ortiz taps into the psyche of the character quite well, while simultaneously being very likable. The scenes between Ortiz and Hoffman are great as they share a very convincing bond onscreen. The film's central performances are all great in their own way and the awkward chemistry between Hoffman and Ryan makes for some great material too. You never question that Connie would fall for someone like Jack and their blossoming relationship is portrayed in a way not often seen in movies. I liked their dynamic in the way that their first date isn't a completely awkward mess, there are no doubts about whether one likes the other, and they don't jump directly into sex.While I seem to recall reading that Hoffman didn't intend to direct this film, he manages to prove his worth as a director. As an actor, he's worked with some of the great directors so it's hardly a surprise he learned something. He seems acutely aware that he's directing an adaptation of a dramatic off-Broadway play and his directorial style is very simplistic, completely void of anything extravagant. There are some nice shots in the film, but if he wasn't a well-known actor his direction wouldn't get any special notice. I doubt Hoffman wanted to direct a film in a style that would garner much attention, so while he proves to be a good director he doesn't attempt anything innovative or unique.I feel that Robert Glaudini's script may be the weakest link in the film as most of what is conveyed in the film spawns from how the actors interpret their scenes than the actual scenes themselves. There are comedic, dramatic, and romantic elements in the script but it seems centered in drama as the comedy is very dark and as one romance begins in the film another one begins spiraling to an end. What little comedy there is in the film seems to come from the way the actors handle their characters rather than what the script dictates for them and the emotional, poignant moments also spawn from the performances rather than what's on the page. The climactic ""dinner party scene"" goes from heartbreaking to humorous and then back to heartbreaking and I think this scene works because of how comfortable Hoffman, Ortiz, Ryan, and Rubin-Vega are with these characters and how they've gotten you to invest your emotions in them.Jack Goes Boating is neither a bad film nor a great one. There's something missing that's key to it being great, but there's nothing noticeably bad about the film. This is where I struggle with the film; I can't quite describe what's wrong with it. What I can tell you is it plays like a traditional quirky, independent film (even the film's score evokes this) and there's nothing particularly memorable about it. Hoffman proves he can direct a solid film and get actors to perform at the top of their game. Furthermore, the film has a touching ending and flawed, yet likable characters. With that said if you feel like seeing this movie I don't wish to stop you but don't expect it to make a lasting impression.GRADE: B-",4,"A Solid, Yet Underwhelming Directorial Debut",1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,4697,"['desperately', 'wanted', 'love', 'Jack', 'Goes', 'Boating', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Oscar-winning', 'actor', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'film', ""'ve"", 'been', 'eagerly', 'waiting', 'see', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'now', ""'ve"", 'watched', ""'m"", 'met', 'near', 'indifference', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'biggest', 'problem', 'ended', 'struggled', 'describe', 'feelings', 'it.Hoffman', 'plays', 'Jack', 'shy', 'unmarried', 'man', 'who', 'limo', 'driver', 'uncle', 'friend', 'Clyde', 'John', 'Ortiz', 'up', 'blind', 'date', 'Connie', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'who', 'Clyde', 'wife', 'Lucy', 'Daphne', 'Rubin-Vega', 'mortuary', 'winter', 'New', 'York', 'Connie', 'mentions', 'once', 'summer', ""'d"", 'like', 'go', 'boating', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'swim', 'Clyde', 'offers', 'help', 'Connie', 'attacked', 'subway', 'Jack', 'cook', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'cook.And', 'so', 'have', 'basic', 'plot', 'Jack', 'Goes', 'Boating', 'film', 'based', 'play', 'Robert', 'Glaudini', 'who', 'adapted', 'play', 'screen', 'stage', 'origins', 'are', 'apparent', 'film', 'being', 'called', 'romance', 'comedy', 'and/or', 'drama', 'think', 'more', 'dramatic', 'character', 'piece', 'Remarkably', 'little', 'occurs', 'actual', 'film', 'more', 'what', 'characters', 'film.With', 'exception', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'core', 'cast', 'reprising', 'roles', 'originated', 'onstage', ""'re"", 'very', 'comfortable', 'characters', 'Hoffman', 'mastered', 'playing', 'awkward', 'men', 'self-confidence', 'Jack', 'find', 'rooting', 'succeed', 'Ortiz', 'great', 'job', 'Clyde', 'portraying', 'character', 'inability', 'forgive', 'least', 'forget', 'significant', 'strain', 'marriage', 'Ortiz', 'psyche', 'character', 'quite', 'well', 'simultaneously', 'being', 'very', 'likable', 'scenes', 'Ortiz', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'great', 'share', 'very', 'convincing', 'bond', 'onscreen', 'film', 'central', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'own', 'way', 'awkward', 'chemistry', 'Hoffman', 'Ryan', 'great', 'material', 'too', 'never', 'question', 'Connie', 'would', 'fall', 'someone', 'Jack', 'blossoming', 'relationship', 'portrayed', 'way', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'movies', 'liked', 'dynamic', 'way', 'first', 'date', ""n't"", 'completely', 'awkward', 'mess', 'are', 'doubts', 'one', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'jump', 'directly', 'sex.While', 'seem', 'recall', 'reading', 'Hoffman', 'did', ""n't"", 'intend', 'direct', 'film', 'prove', 'worth', 'director', 'actor', 'worked', 'great', 'directors', 'hardly', 'surprise', 'learned', 'something', 'acutely', 'aware', 'directing', 'adaptation', 'dramatic', 'off-Broadway', 'play', 'directorial', 'style', 'very', 'simplistic', 'completely', 'void', 'anything', 'extravagant', 'are', 'nice', 'shots', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'well-known', 'actor', 'direction', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'special', 'notice', 'doubt', 'Hoffman', 'wanted', 'direct', 'film', 'style', 'would', 'garner', 'much', 'attention', 'so', 'be', 'good', 'director', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'anything', 'innovative', 'unique.I', 'feel', 'Robert', 'Glaudini', 'script', 'may', 'be', 'weakest', 'link', 'film', 'most', 'what', 'conveyed', 'film', 'spawns', 'how', 'actors', 'interpret', 'scenes', 'actual', 'scenes', 'are', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'romantic', 'elements', 'script', 'centered', 'drama', 'comedy', 'very', 'dark', 'one', 'romance', 'film', 'one', 'spiraling', 'end', 'What', 'little', 'comedy', 'film', 'come', 'way', 'actors', 'handle', 'characters', 'rather', 'what', 'script', 'emotional', 'poignant', 'moments', 'also', 'spawn', 'performances', 'rather', 'what', 'page', 'climactic', 'dinner', 'party', 'scene', 'heartbreaking', 'humorous', 'then', 'back', 'heartbreaking', 'think', 'scene', 'how', 'comfortable', 'Hoffman', 'Ortiz', 'Ryan', 'Rubin-Vega', 'are', 'characters', 'how', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'invest', 'emotions', 'them.Jack', 'Goes', 'Boating', 'bad', 'film', 'great', 'one', 'something', 'missing', 'key', 'being', 'great', 'nothing', 'noticeably', 'bad', 'film', 'where', 'struggle', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'describe', 'what', 'wrong', 'What', 'can', 'tell', 'traditional', 'quirky', 'independent', 'film', 'even', 'film', 'score', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'Hoffman', 'can', 'direct', 'solid', 'film', 'get', 'actors', 'perform', 'top', 'game', 'Furthermore', 'film', 'touching', 'ending', 'flawed', 'yet', 'likable', 'characters', 'said', 'feel', 'seeing', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'stop', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'make', 'lasting', 'impression.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A

It had such a slow start that I about gave up watching it after 10 minutes, but kept on til the end. The stars mumble so much that it is hard to hear the lines. Plus all the characters are just downright weird. I thought Jack might be  the normal one of the bunch but then I noticed he never took his cap off and of course that is all I could concentrate on until he finally removed it (I then wished he would put it back on since he had a bad hair day in every scene thereafter.). His new girlfriend Connie just irritated me, first by acting like every man was hitting on her (that part was laughable though since she is so plain looking)and then telling Jack she ""liked it rough"".

1277301,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B002LVVCJY,Kevin F. Tasker,"[12, 13]","Jack Goes Boating marks the directorial debut of one of America's most accomplished and one of my personal favorite actors, the brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman. The man has been a spark in such films as Spike Lee's touching 25th Hour and the Charlie Kaufman-helmed surrealist mind-bender Synecdoche, Ny. His direction here is understated, his film shambling but not entirely bleak. Jack Goes Boating is a drifting picture, but it is a winner because of its heart. It could have, given the subject matter, a relentlessly dour experience. Instead, Hoffman incorporates both the happy and the sad in mostly equal measures. A small film, but a success.The film centers on a neurotic, rasti-loving New York limo driver with a penchant for pot and a nearly overwhelming sense of day-to-day isolation. He latches onto a couple whose marital fabric is stretching from past indiscretions, through whom he is introduced to an equally neurotic young woman named Connie who seems to have a good if oft-trampled heart.In some ways, Jack Goes Boating feels a lot like a Cheever or a Raymond Carver short story. There is not a lot of action, the story centering mainly on character interactions. It is plodding but never dull. There are many surprises, actually, such as a weird subway scene and a dinner party climax for the ages. Despite what its detractors will no doubt claim, the film strikes a resonant tone. It seems ""real"", for lack of a better word. Hoffman's performance is understated but always reliable and Amy Ryan is excellent as the damaged Connie. The two leads are ultimately a conjoined foil for the other couple whose marital pains provide the film's moral center, as well as dramatic tension.Indie enthusiasts take note, the soundtrack is also quite interesting. Though the song choices are generic, the bands represented are some of my favorites, Grizzly Bear and Fleet Foxes among them. Ultimately, this is a soft film with a lot of memorable scenes, snappy dialogue and while it may meander, that is its charm.

Going in to Jack Goes Boating, I guess my expectations were a bit higher than they shouldn't have.It's not that Jack Goes Boating is bad, so much as it isn't good. The characters all seem to have ""quirky"" dialed up extra high, which kept me feeling as though the entire film walked a line just shy of being entirely trite.The overall ""feel"" of the film seemed aspirational, for lack of a better term. It wants to be as offbeat-but-intellectual asEternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. As indie-cred asRequiem for a Dream. Maybe as important asLost in Translation. It plods along with a sort of arthouse cliche undertone that so heavy, you almost pay more attention wondering if it was designed to elicit critical praise than to the film itself.Unquestionably, it's a must-see for Hoffman fans who may be more forgiving.

1277303,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B002LVVCJY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 6]","Every year, there are a fair share of idiosyncratic character pieces that pop up in the indie film scene that are loaded down with critical hyperbole proclaiming them as comedic masterworks. And nine out of ten times, these films (marketed as comedies) leave mainstream audiences perplexed. ""Jack Goes Boating"" is a prime example of just such a film--albeit one with a pretty impressive pedigree. Directed by and starring the great Philip Seymour Hoffman with the terrific Amy Ryan providing support, let me make one thing clear before I go any further--I am EXACTLY the audience for this film. In fact, when it was in town theatrically, I was going to go but it only lasted one week in our local movie houses. So I knew what this film was, had my expectations firmly in check, and was eager to jump right in! Well, truth be told, Hoffman's work left me a little cold with its remote awkwardness.I appreciate films that can mine comic inspiration from the world's disconnectedness. ""Jack Goes Boating"" assembles the requisite damaged oddballs and brings them together to achieve maximum quirkiness. I'd describe the plot, but it is really rather superfluous. In summary, Hoffman and Ryan play an unlikely pair brought together by their married, but increasingly troubled, friends (John Ortiz and Daphne Ruben-Vega). That's about it. Will the pair be able to overcome their own problems to unite as a post modern example of healthy couple-hood? Or will you care? That might be a far more astute question. On some level, the viewer must be able to connect with the characters--preferably to like them, but absolutely essentially to understand them. Here, the characters stand as constructs--bits of weirdness with no real world explanation to their social deficiencies. If you knew the central characters in your real life, you would run in the opposite direction so as not to be sucked into their unexplained and self-imposed misery.I didn't hate the movie, per se, I was just completely removed from it. Anyone, however, judging the marketing campaign and picking this up as a robust comedy might feel a bit betrayed. I knew what to expect. Still, Ryan is glass menagerie brittle while Hoffman is monosyllabic awkwardness. Neither character is developed much beyond superficial qualities that would brand them social pariahs. Ortiz stands as the only member of the cast that possessed an iota of joy or genuine warmth--and the film progressively makes him less and less palatable. At the end, I didn't care about anyone in the film and in a program billed as ""heartfelt""--this is a major stumbling block. There were moments I quite liked, but as a whole, the picture never gelled to be anything other than odd.

Well, a question that came to me after watching was: Can boating or swimming be a metaphor for floating easily through life?  I thought so, after viewing this poignant film about four New York friends who each struggle with personal issues as well as issues they have as couples.The underlying current of this well-acted slice-of-life film seemed to be that the best way to enjoy life, and to triumph over problems big or small, is to learn to relax, let go, and enjoy the simple things.  Like cooking, for example. During a scene where Jack is making dinner for his friends, there is this comment: ""When you cook for someone, it can be an act of love.""  How many of us are able to view the small experiences in life that way? And will Jack, the main character, learn to do so?

Hubby: ""Wow, that has to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. What crap."" Me: ""I thought it was funny and touching. Odd, but interesting."" Which one of is right? Probably a little of both because I can see his point. But, because I'm writing the review, my view wins.Hoffman plays Jack, a not-so-young-anymore, underpaid limo driver with underdeveloped social skills and a big heart who uses his headphones to escape to his beloved reggae music. Jack seems doomed to live out his quiet, lonely life as one of the millions of faceless people in New York City. His best friend, Clyde, masks his own pain by presenting an upbeat image and doling out advice to Jack. Clyde and his wife, Lucy, introduce Jack to Connie, a plain, shy, awkward woman with a bent toward paranoia and self-destruction.And hilarity ensues.Ok, hilarity doesn't ensue but these characters come together and break apart in some surprising and not-so-surprising ways. Clyde teaches Jack to swim so that Jack can fulfill his promise to Connnie that he will take her boating in the summer. Jack and Connie embark on one of the most bumbling courtships I've ever watched on film. Some of the scenes made me cringe but Hoffman once again is able to pull off the quiet, anonymous everyman character with ease. There is something so tender about his attitude toward the off-putting Connie. Clyde and Lucy butt heads in ever-increasing displays of marital animosity. While one relationship buds, another dissolves.I am a Philip Seymour Hoffman fan and will give any of his films a chance, but I have to admit that Amy Ryan's Connie steals this show. She is phenomenal and believable and allows what could be an easily dismissed, mundane, quirky character to get right under the viewer's skin. This is a quiet film and one that does not give out immediate gratification. It is slow-moving with beautifully bleak scenes of gritty NYC in winter. Watching these characters can actually be painful at times, but this only adds to the appeal of the film, at least for me. I'm glad I watched this at home rather than at the theatre; I could take my time with it and focus on the characters and dialogue rather than looking forward to ""what happens next."" I certainly can see why some people really didn't like this movie - it is uncomfortable and slow to the point of being maddening.

Sometimes those conversions fail because the intimacy of the stage is lost and the expanse of film feels contrived, but here a good balance was achieved. The diverse landscape of New York City adds much texture and dimension to the film.Sprinkled with dry, and sometimes blatantly black humor, the film examines the fragile construction of relationships. This is a story about two couples, one disintegrating and one tentatively uniting. It is an examination of what lengths we will go to in order to connect with a potential love, and the pain we will endure to try to hold on to an established bond.The movie isn't lighthearted, but it is good-hearted. Our friends, flawed as they may be, enrich our lives and the warmth communicated by the four central characters is quite extraordinary. I measure films like this by my level of distraction.

In my opinion, ""Jack Goes Boating"" is a fascinating character study of dysfunctional people building and/or knocking down relationships.  What humor there is, is of the dry type, and sometimes even a little dark.Two things set this movie apart from many others, first is the acting.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Ryan, John Ortiz and Daphne Rubin-Vega are all solid!  Hoffman and Ryan as two semi-lost souls brought together by well-meaning friends for a blind date; and Oriz and Rubin-Vega as a couple that can't seem to sustain the traction in their relationship.  Hoffman and Ryan's performance levels shouldn't come as much of a surprise, neither one of them ever phones in a role.  But I've never seen or noticed Rubin-Vega before, and she deftly plays the part of a woman who could be just an innocent flirt with her boss and others, or an active cougar.Hoffman is a limo driver, aspiring to a more consistent employment at the MTA.  Ortiz is his friend and fellow driver who takes him under his wing, trying to help him learn to swim, get a date and even learn to cook.  He and Rubin-Vega decide to fix Jack (Hoffman) up with Ryan, a mousey little thing that is either the frequent target of sexual predators or a woman with issues of paranoia (you're often left questioning a number of things like that).  She works as a telemarketer (and not a very effective one) for a mortuary science doctor with Rubin-Vega.  Interestingly as Hoffman and Ryan circle closer and closer, Ortiz and Rubin-Vega start spiraling apart.That brings me to the second superlative aspect of this movie, Hoffman's directorial debut.  His direction throughout is solid!  One scene especially ands out, where Hoffman and Oriz have a deep conversation in a car.  Early in the conversation, a snowplow drives by throwing slush on the windshield.  I mention that, because the melting snow gives testament to the fact that the dialogue is shot in a single ongoing take... brilliantly executed!If only the script could have been as strong as the acting and direction.  The dialog rarely soars, and the plot moves at a snail's pace.  Many people will still like it, but it's clearly not for all.  Multi-dimensional characters can make a movie watchable, however they still need a little more plot development than Hoffman had to work with.  This could have been a 4 or 5 star film, but I have to just give it a strong 3.",3,Great Acting...

Hoffman's Jack cares deeply for Amy Ryan's Connie, and puts so much effort into learning to cook a perfect meal for her, and learning to swim so that one day they might go boating.His friend Clyde and Lucy are supportive of his efforts, as Clyde teaches Jack to swim, and both Clyde and Lucy encourage him as he practices his cooking.  But Clyde and Lucy's own relationship is fragile, with troubles that gradually build and eventually erupt in ways that quickly change the tone of the movie.I was surprised at what I felt was a sudden shift in where the movie was headed, but in the end I really liked the movie for all its ups and downs.  All four lead characters were well played, with Hoffman and Ryan standing out as troubled people who want to find love.Phillip Seymour Hoffman seems to gravitate toward characters who challenge you to care about them (his role in Love Liza, in particular, was a challenge).

Unless your definition of comedy doesn't include any laughs.  Although reviewers on the package said it's ""Dryly hilarious"" and has ""A great many funny moments..."" I for one didn't notice any.  I wasn't chuckling at any time.  Melodramatic maybe, but NOT comedy.  Cringe inducing, definately.While I liked the movie--it's very good--I found it in some manner to be very unsettling.  SO, that being said, here's MY take on JACK GOES BOATING.What it IS is a extremely well-acted character study of two socially inept people who are introduced to each other by a mutually known, typically disfunctional couple.  Amy Ryan was fantastic.  As socially akward Connie, she made me cringe in fear for Jack several times.  A seemingly nice person, Connie appeared borderline unstable--the kind you (as a man) worry might be singing a different story to the police tomorrow.  One scene in particular, where characters Jack and Connie have an intimate moment in her apartment, was one of those ""is yes no or is no yes or is yes yes or no no"" moments.  A VERY uncomfortable, alarm bells ringing, slap Jack upside the head and say ""RUN!"" moment.  The kind of scene that, in real life, would make an average person with normal social skills think, ""Oh Oh. DANGER.""There's a fine line between being rational and irrational and ""Connie"" was walking a tightrope.  Not exactly trust inspiring and trust is a very important part of any sane relationship.  I think that's where the ""creepy"" feeling this movie gives me comes from.  While I wanted to like the character of Connie, I don't think I could ever trust her.Jack, on the other hand (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is more of a withdrawn, harmless, socially inept guy who doesn't seem to bother to try to connect to anyone.  But, overcoming that, he strives to connect with Connie, although not without some bad scenes along the way.All in all, while the story has a ""happy"" ending--at least as far as Jack and Connie go--it still left me feeling kind of creepy and uncomfortable and worried for Jack's well being in the future.  Not that Connie was a bad or malicious person, rather that Connie didn't seem to have both feet in reality and had some very serious intimacy issues.  Which, while they seemed happy as the movie ended, left me thinking somewhere down the road, it's NOT going to end well for either of them.I'd give FOUR STARS to JACK GOES BOATING.  Not really a ""feel good"" movie, but simply an extremely well-acted performance by EVERYONE.

Today, I heard an interview Seymour Hoffman gave to Terry Gross on a. 'Fresh Air' program about his career. One of the first roles he really coveted was that of playing a 'Drag Queen' opposite Robert DeNiro. I had not seen this film, today I did.Seymour Hoffman talked about how he found the personna of Rusty, the drag queen. He read all he could, and he met with several transgendered women. He studied their habits. He was a 5ft 10 in 200 lb man with a very deep voice trying to fit into the body of a female. Watching the film, you forget this is a man, Seymour Hoffman, he has become Rusty, and that was his greatness. He became the character. Although he concluded that Rusty was ugly, not to me. She became a woman with soul and guts, someone looking for love.DeNiro plays a retired Security Guard, who was once a hero, and now is recovering from a stroke. He had nothing but negatives to say about the transgendered community, and even though they were neighbors, they never saw eye to eye. That is, until, De Niro's character, Walter Koontz needs Rusty. Learning to sing would help in his recovery, and he hires Rusty. It begins as a rocky relationship and ends up as friendship. This is a poignant film with a wacky charm.We will not see the likes of Phillip Seymour Hoffman again, what a sad, sad day.

We see a contrast in the lives of Jack and Connie and their best friends Clyde (John Ortiz) and Lucy (Daphne Rubin-Vega). The love life warms up for Jack and Connie as the story unfolds but it gets sour for their friends Clyde and Lucy. We see an effort on the side of Jack and Connie to reach out for each other with a touch of humor.

Fine acting, especially from John Ortiz and Amy Ryan, a script adapted by Robert Glaudini from his play, and a straight-forward narrative, laced with clever banter, still left me bummed out. P S Hoffman directs himself as Jack, a would-be loser who decides to better himself to impress a lady.

This movie is about Jack getting set up on a blind date by his best friend and the events that follow it.  Jack is a likeable guy, but there is something different about him.  He isn't slick like his friend, but rather nearly socially awkward.Jack goes to great lengths to prepare himself for his next date learning to cook (so he can make her dinner) and even learning to swim (so he can take her boating).  You have to give him a lot of credit for going to such great lengths to please this woman he just met as she is nearly just as socially awkward as him and probably more weird than him too.I liked the light humor and Hoffman's character Jack comes off being very likeable.  The story isn't bad, but isn't one that everyone is going to enjoy.  My biggest turn off to this movie is toward the end, when the tension is building, they all get drugged out and act crazy.

My reactions are all over the place on this one.I admire Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Ryan.  I respect their instincts in being involved with this project.  Personally, I think Amy Ryan's performance is more nuanced and impressive than Hoffman's.  I thought the script was occasionally mannered and self-indulgent.  I was stunned by the extreme measures Jack took because he knew it would please Connie.  He is a simple guy and probably did not need to give it much thought, but he learned to swim! and cook!  And he worked hard at these endeavors.  His attention to detail and continual rehearsing of the steps involved was the most moving part of his performance for me.Still, I can't get beyond the ick factor.  PSH's hair is terrible.  Terrible.  Maybe the worst of any actor's hair in any movie I have ever seen.  Also, Clyde and Lucy's derailment of Jack's big night bothers me a lot.  It is definitely a true-to-life plot development but I hated it.  The ick factor also crept up in the bedroom scene between Jack and Connie.  I believe it could happen this way but I was very uncomfortable watching it.Possible spoiler alert:  Did anyone else note that the guy who approached Connie on the subway (and presumably her attacker) bore a striking resemblance to the Cannoli?As other reviewers have pointed out, few people will find this movie hilarious.

1277328,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002LVVCJY,Turfseer,"[6, 12]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***The late Phillip Seymour Hoffman's directorial debut of 'Jack Goes Boating' was not one of the better films he was associated with. Perhaps it was his stellar reputation that influenced viewers to heap accolades upon it.Hoffman chose to take on this project because he played the same role in the source material, an off-Broadway play (of the same title) produced in 2007. Also along for the ride were John Ortiz (Clyde) and Daphne Rubin-Vega (Lucy), who appeared in the original production.'Jack Goes Boating' is the tale of a socially inept limousine driver who works for his uncle and lives alone. He's one of those trite characters with a heart of gold, reminiscent of 'Marty', the 1955 Academy Award winner for best picture about a lonely Bronx butcher. Like 'Marty', Jack is self-effacing and sexually inexperienced; he meets up with Connie who is the equivalent of the wallflower Clara, an introverted woman who Marty ends up falling for.Jack is introduced to Connie by his best friend, Clyde, who also works as a limousine driver for Jack's uncle. It turns out that Jack's beau, Lucy, works with Connie at a funeral home where the mortuary director has his employees operate a side business selling seminars through telemarketing. Connie is also a dead fish like Jack and I suppose that's why they like each other. The story takes an unpleasant turn when Connie is sexually assaulted on the subway (must have been a few stops later, since we see the perpetrator eying Connie on a CROWDED train). Of course simple but sensitive Jack has the right touch and will ultimately help Connie get over her fear of sexual intimacy.As for Jack, he's busy filling out an application for the MTA (when jobs were still available!) and learning how to swim under the tutelage of Clyde since Connie wants to go boating. Another one of Jack's limitations (that he's really bothered by) is the fact that he doesn't know how to cook. So a chef friend of Lucy tutors him on how to prepare a nice casserole. Sure enough, the dark moment of Act 2 is when the four principals end up getting high and Jack's casserole goes up in flames. He locks himself in the bathroom and Connie has to coax him out. Meanwhile Lucy and Clyde have their meltdown when Clyde, in an act of retribution, invites Lucy's old flame she had an affair with, over to dinner.Very few people like Jack and Connie exist in real life. If they do, they certainly don't make for good drama. Instead of writing about people who like themselves (those who happen to have egos), the film's scenarist ask us to root for a couple of caricatures, plagued with substantial inferiority complexes. Of course there are always suckers who will be taken in by such sentimental, manipulative drama.While I admired Hoffman in 'Capote' and 'The Savages', I think his decision to choose this type of material for his directorial debut, was a mistake. It's unfortunate that he'll never get more chances to show us his talents as a director as he had already proved that he was a great actor.",1,Hoffman's inauspicious directorial debut features tale of mismatched sad sacks,1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,3067,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***The', 'late', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'directorial', 'debut', ""'Jack"", 'Goes', 'Boating', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'was', 'associated', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'stellar', 'reputation', 'influenced', 'viewers', 'heap', 'accolades', 'it.Hoffman', 'chose', 'take', 'project', 'played', 'same', 'role', 'source', 'material', 'off-Broadway', 'play', 'same', 'title', 'produced', '2007', 'Also', 'along', 'ride', 'were', 'John', 'Ortiz', 'Clyde', 'Daphne', 'Rubin-Vega', 'Lucy', 'who', 'appeared', 'original', 'production', ""'Jack"", 'Goes', 'Boating', 'tale', 'socially', 'inept', 'limousine', 'driver', 'who', 'uncle', 'alone', 'one', 'trite', 'characters', 'heart', 'gold', 'reminiscent', ""'Marty"", '1955', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'best', 'picture', 'lonely', 'Bronx', 'butcher', ""'Marty"", 'Jack', 'self-effacing', 'sexually', 'inexperienced', 'up', 'Connie', 'who', 'equivalent', 'wallflower', 'Clara', 'introverted', 'woman', 'who', 'Marty', 'up', 'falling', 'for.Jack', 'introduced', 'Connie', 'best', 'friend', 'Clyde', 'who', 'also', 'limousine', 'driver', 'Jack', 'uncle', 'out', 'Jack', 'beau', 'Lucy', 'Connie', 'funeral', 'home', 'where', 'mortuary', 'director', 'employees', 'operate', 'side', 'business', 'selling', 'seminars', 'telemarketing', 'Connie', 'also', 'dead', 'fish', 'Jack', 'suppose', 'why', 'like', 'other', 'story', 'unpleasant', 'turn', 'when', 'Connie', 'sexually', 'assaulted', 'subway', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'stops', 'later', 'see', 'perpetrator', 'eying', 'Connie', 'CROWDED', 'train', 'course', 'simple', 'sensitive', 'Jack', 'right', 'touch', 'will', 'ultimately', 'help', 'Connie', 'get', 'fear', 'sexual', 'intimacy.As', 'Jack', 'busy', 'filling', 'out', 'application', 'MTA', 'when', 'jobs', 'were', 'still', 'available', 'learning', 'how', 'swim', 'tutelage', 'Clyde', 'Connie', 'go', 'boating', 'one', 'Jack', 'limitations', 'really', 'bothered', 'fact', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'cook', 'chef', 'friend', 'Lucy', 'tutors', 'how', 'prepare', 'nice', 'casserole', 'Sure', 'enough', 'dark', 'moment', 'Act', '2', 'when', 'four', 'principals', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'high', 'Jack', 'casserole', 'up', 'flames', 'bathroom', 'Connie', 'coax', 'out', 'Meanwhile', 'Lucy', 'Clyde', 'have', 'meltdown', 'when', 'Clyde', 'act', 'retribution', 'Lucy', 'old', 'flame', 'had', 'affair', 'dinner.Very', 'few', 'people', 'Jack', 'Connie', 'exist', 'real', 'life', 'do', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'drama', 'Instead', 'writing', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'who', 'happen', 'have', 'egos', 'film', 'scenarist', 'ask', 'root', 'couple', 'caricatures', 'plagued', 'substantial', 'inferiority', 'complexes', 'course', 'are', 'always', 'suckers', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'such', 'sentimental', 'manipulative', 'drama.While', 'admired', 'Hoffman', ""'Capote"", 'Savages', 'think', 'decision', 'choose', 'type', 'material', 'directorial', 'debut', 'was', 'mistake', 'unfortunate', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'more', 'chances', 'show', 'talents', 'director', 'had', 'already', 'proved', 'was', 'great', 'actor']",N/A

The characters are psychologically complex and interesting, but I found them difficult to relate to.The film centers on two shy, working class New Yorkers, Jack (Philip Seymour-Hoffman) and Connie (Amy Ryan). The pair is fixed up by their friends Clyde (John Ortiz) and Lucy (Daphne Rubin-Vega), a seemingly well-adjusted couple whose outgoing personalities mask serious problems. As Jack and Connie push the limits of their comfort zones and inch toward a relationship, Clyde and Lucy begin to fall apart.The dialogue contains a slow subtlety, and the acting is superb--particularly that of Seymour-Hoffman, who portrays Jack with a nuanced performance. Despite Jack's sparse dialogue, the character comes through strongly in his understated mannerisms. Ryan lends an unnerving quality to Connie, who experiences a series of unrelated sexual assault or harassment incidents and clearly has issues with men. Ryan's expression and deadpan, blunt delivery of shocking or emotional lines create a subtle sense that something is ""off"" about Connie, though it's not entirely clear what.JACK GOES BOATING succeeds in its often uncomfortable realism. I squirmed inwardly as the clumsy romance developed between Jack and Connie, and I reacted likewise as Clyde and Lucy grasped at the frayed threads of their soured love. While some people may appreciate the film's bitter quality, I found its characters hard to engage with emotionally, so I was never truly drawn in to the story.",3,A Slow Row through Dark Waters,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,1859,"['know', 'terrible', 'movies', 'love', 'even', 'know', ""'re"", 'bad', 'Hudson', 'Hawk', 'example', 'Well', 'movie', 'was', 'exact', 'opposite', 'was', 'well-written', 'well-directed', 'well-acted', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'JACK', 'GOES', 'BOATING', 'advertised', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'had', 'moments', 'generally', 'found', 'romantic', 'particularly', 'funny', 'characters', 'are', 'psychologically', 'complex', 'interesting', 'found', 'difficult', 'relate', 'to.The', 'film', 'centers', 'two', 'shy', 'working', 'class', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'Jack', 'Philip', 'Seymour-Hoffman', 'Connie', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'pair', 'fixed', 'up', 'friends', 'Clyde', 'John', 'Ortiz', 'Lucy', 'Daphne', 'Rubin-Vega', 'seemingly', 'well-adjusted', 'couple', 'outgoing', 'personalities', 'mask', 'serious', 'problems', 'Jack', 'Connie', 'push', 'limits', 'comfort', 'zones', 'inch', 'relationship', 'Clyde', 'Lucy', 'begin', 'fall', 'apart.The', 'dialogue', 'slow', 'subtlety', 'acting', 'superb', 'particularly', 'Seymour-Hoffman', 'who', 'Jack', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Jack', 'sparse', 'dialogue', 'character', 'through', 'strongly', 'understated', 'mannerisms', 'Ryan', 'unnerving', 'quality', 'Connie', 'who', 'series', 'unrelated', 'sexual', 'assault', 'harassment', 'incidents', 'clearly', 'issues', 'men', 'Ryan', 'expression', 'deadpan', 'blunt', 'delivery', 'shocking', 'emotional', 'lines', 'create', 'subtle', 'sense', 'something', 'Connie', 'not', 'entirely', 'clear', 'what.JACK', 'GOES', 'BOATING', 'often', 'uncomfortable', 'realism', 'squirmed', 'inwardly', 'clumsy', 'romance', 'developed', 'Jack', 'Connie', 'reacted', 'likewise', 'Clyde', 'Lucy', 'grasped', 'frayed', 'threads', 'soured', 'love', 'people', 'may', 'appreciate', 'film', 'bitter', 'quality', 'found', 'characters', 'hard', 'engage', 'emotionally', 'was', 'never', 'truly', 'drawn', 'story']",N/A

Sad as one couple are breaking up another couple are finding each other.  The only comic relief was Connie telling Jack that she though his was sexy!!!  I guess there is a reason this was an off-broadway play and maybe the Producers of this movie should have left it off-Broadway!

There are a lot of things to like about this film, including the ""ordinary guy"" aspect of the character Jack.  He's somebody who's struggling with many of the same things the rest of us are, such as relationship issues and getting a better job, but he works hard to maintain a ""positive vibe.""  The story is about two couples, all four people portrayed very well by the actors who played them, especially John Ortiz as Clyde.  But it's a lot of the smaller things that made me like ""Jack Goes Boating,"" including the effective use of music, both songs and score; plus such storytelling touches as the way Jack tries to visualize the things he is learning.  The central scene in the movie, the dinner party, was a bit hard to watch.  Still, I acknowledge its importance and saw how it ties into the rest of the story, how it is both the outcome of what came before it and affects what comes after it.The extras on the disc are fairly minimal, with two short featurettes and two even shorter deleted scenes.",4,Phil S.
