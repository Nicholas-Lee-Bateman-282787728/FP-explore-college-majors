Wayne Thompson IV,"[1, 1]","I've enjoyed more than my fair share of Sundays in suspense about whether the Jets would cover 3 1/2 and so on, so I suppose I had reasonably high expectations for some entertainment when approaching this movie.  Of course, I should know by now, that's a terrible way to approach a 'film' with Matthew McConaughey in it.  It's also not a good way to approach a film that looks on the surface like another chance for Pacino to phone it in and laugh all the way to the bank.Let's not speak of Rene Russo's typically superfluous and embarrassing presence, ok?, this sentence excepted.Why is it bad?  Let's start with the acting.  I've known sugared-up 3rd graders with more pathos potential than McC.  He's fair enough during the ""aw, shucks"" portion of the flick, which survives through much of the first act, but by the times things start rolling and he has to turn into Mr. pr**k it's all over.He also suffers by comparison to Pacino, or course, at least at first.  After a few minutes on screen though it's clear Pacino's just doing his 'hey I'll see how over the top I can make this' thing that he's been doing for 15 years and the scenes become mutually embarrassing.  And I said we wouldn't speak of Russo.  The deligtfully slimy Jeremy Piven, who's at home in a movie like this, of course is relegated to a C story and about 7 minutes of screentime.Let's also talk about the script.  I don't expect much from movies like this, but I do expect some exploration of and exposure to the subsection of society they're covering.  But aside from a few rushed conversations in Mc's office we don't really get to the meat of sports gambling, we don't really see everyday gamblers living and dying on every possession like happens, you know, in real life.  I wanted more of that.  Another problem with the story is that it gets wrapped up in a love triangle plot...Hollywood, I know we have to try our best to make this a date movie, but next time at least make the triangle a believable and interesting one.Is there anything else?  Yeah, but I've already wasted too many words on this film.

I hated Rocky, Young Blood and all of those other flicks that focus on a hero/heroine battling it out in one sports arena or another. But maybe that's one of the reasons why I loved this movie. It doesn't really follow a sport per se, but goes more into the intricacies of sports betting. Yes, you do see football being played and people watching it and cheering the teams on, but as an important part of a much deeper plot.Al Pacino's performance alone makes this movie worth seeing; his character probably has more twists and turns than even the plot itself, and that's saying a lot. Matthew and Rene are also great in their roles as the people who love him and want to do the right thing by him, even when it means being ""cruel to be kind.""

I didn't think so!)But taking a look at something so addictive and so expensive is a bit unnerving. Two hundred billion dollars a year in sports gambling? That's ""billion."" Whoa. The problem with this, however, is that ""normal"" people won't have any idea about the machinations behind such a business, and that is one of this film's biggest failings. Myself never having been a sports gambler, I simply couldn't relate to this shady business nor could I have cared.The main problem was that the focus was on the men who were on the inside, not those most affected by the bets: the little man who loses everything due to his addiction and the pressure put on them by bookies and gambling affiliates (beware in Vegas!) Two For the Money did show a touch - just a bit - of the terrible side-effects of gambling by glimpsing a man named Mohammed who ran a dry cleaning service. But it was very short.The prime focus was on Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey, REIGN OF FIRE, 2002) an injured football player turned sports-win-picker who's 80% successful selections make him a phenomenon. No one's ever done that and Walter Abrams' (Al Pacino, THE GODFATHER, 1972) bookie team grabs hold of Brandon and inducts him into their company. He quickly leads them to unparalleled success, money and fame but, as fickle as luck/fate can be, it just as quickly gets snatched away.Although it's interesting to get an insider's look into this little-known world, it's also (as stated earlier) of little concern to most mainstream Americans (I know of no one who has sports gambling problems ...but maybe that's just me).The other big failing was that the movie brought up problems related to these two men, but then summarily dropped them with no rhyme or reason. For instance, we're told early on that Walter Abrams has a heart condition, then ? of the way through the flick it's never mentioned again. We're also shown how upset some of the rich and famous become when they lose, and one of these wealthy men sends ""a warning"" to Brandon. It happens once, and then we never hear of it again, as if they (the movie makers) just wanted to show us this side of the issue. You know what I said when I saw that: ""Who cares?""All in all a poorly done film. The script was seriously lacking (and littered with holes) and the acting was nothing special. Pacino is just Pacino. But I'm sure the ladies will love seeing McConaughey with his shirt off.

955927,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B000CBCWRG,Chris Luallen,"[0, 0]","""Two for the Money"" starts with the character of Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey), an ex-jock who has a talent for handicapping football games. He starts off working 900 numbers in Las Vegas. But is soon discovered by Walter Abrams, a recovering gambling addict seeking  to build a sports betting media empire.Of course, this is all a recipe for disaster and from there the movie takes many obvious turns. Brandon is changed by Walter into ""John Anthony"" - a charismatic, handicapping guru who advises high stakes sports gamblers. Of course, Brandon starts off on a huge winning streak and then immediately becomes  Walter's protege. They both had messed up childhoods. So Walter also becomes a sort of dysfunctional dad to replace Brandon's father who left home when he was age 10. After reaching the heights of gambling glory, Brandon's luck runs out, as he picks losers for several consecutive weeks. This, of course, loses big money for Walter's business and thus the circle of brief success but ultimate failure comes to pass. That is apparently what the ""born to lose"" Walter expected all along. From there the story proceeds to a very implausible twist involving Brandon and Walter's recovering heroin junkie of a wife - Toni (Rene Russo). By the way, Toni is the stable one in the family. In the end, Brandon finds redemption by leaving Walter to return home to his former life of purity.Ultimately, this movie is about self-destructive people and the lengths that they will go to screw up their lives and to bring everyone nearby down with them. It's a sad story. But, unfortunately, this movie is so predictable and with such a hokey ending that it all turns out to be a terrible bore. This is especially true since Brandon is so cocky and Walter is so hell bent on destruction that it is hard to feel much empathy for either of these unlikable characters.I give it an extra star because I did stay awake until the end.

He loves the game and takes a job for chump change dispensing betting tips from a 900 number in a cubicle. His skill at predicting winners in football catches the eye of Walter (Al Pacino), a clever and compulsive entrepreneur who has found a legal way of passing on advice to betters and then taking a percentage of their winnings in exchange for more predictions on football games. The reason he is so good at what he does is because he is a reformed gambling addict who knows that one of the best highs comes with the fear of losing it all.Walter believes that Brandon is his ticket to the big time, so he sets him up in a fancy apartment and office. When his prot&eacute;g&eacute; starts an amazing streak of predictions that come true, he ups the ante and makes him the lead man on his cable TV show. Brandon, a man who believes in God and doesn't gamble or swear, starts to get caught up in the adrenaline rush of fame and good fortune. Walter's wife Toni (Rene Russo), a former junkie, knows the pitfalls of being around her fast-talking, manipulative and hard-driving husband. In addition, Brandon knows that at any moment his boss could die because of his bad heart and compulsive smoking.Two For The Money is directed by D.J. Caruso. The screenplay by Dan Gilroy is inspired by a true story of an athlete who found a career in handicapping sports events for a 1-900 service in Las Vegas. This morality play hinges on the interplay between Brandon and his mentor Walter; Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey catch all the spunk and sparks between these two as they roll toward grand success (especially when they sign up an obscenely wealthy gambler, played by Armand Assante) and then veer sharply into trouble. The film reveals the rot beneath the $200 billion dollar a year business in gambling on sports events. Why do they do it? As Walter puts it, they are looking for ""certainty in an uncertain world.""

Thats the whole story in a nutshell.Really, the story is nothing new. Actually quite formulatic. I can't really say that there is anything new. But the thing about this movie is the acting.The acting is great. Matthew M. is suprisingly very good. I don't think he is a bad actor, but I don't see him as a breakout actor for his acting abilities. He is quite good in this movie though as the arrogant sports-to-go-to man for gambling tips. Jeremy Piven, though in a small role, is very similar to his character on Entourage, but you know, he's great as that character as he is in this one. Al Pacino is always good. Acutally, he's great in this movie. The only problem is that his character is very conventional Pacino. Always yelling, yelling, yelling, getting mad, being scary. But, Pacino is good at that. Though Pacino is presenting nothing new here, he is very good at presenting nothing new. My favorite though is Rene Russo. She really suprised me with her performance. Her struggles to keep her husband (Pacino) in check and keeping (McC) out of the business is well covered by her acting abilities. Though all three previous actors are great, I think Russo steals the movie.The great thing about this movie was the ending.

In fact, Rounders is pretty bad.I bring that up here because Two For the Money has two things going strong for it: a really top-notch cast (Al Pacino, Matthew McConaughey, Renee Russo) and a great premise (about the rise of real-life sports betting guru Brandon Lang, and fall, and rise again). It's also not very good.Now, don't get me wrong, it's not bad. It's certainly not Rounders-bad. But it isn't great either. The acting is strong all the way around (Pacino plays the same character he always does--loud, gruff, tempramental and enigmatically deep--some people like it, and others do not). However, the pacing is slow and the plot doesn't have a lot of steam to it. Lang is supposed to be the center of the story, but it's hard to care about him (he doesn't do a whole lot, other than watch sports and work out) which allows Pacino's interesting, but deeply flawed character, to take center stage. It winds up being a character study of a man ""addicted to losing""--probably not what most sports fans might be hoping for out of this.Ehh, all in all this is a passable movie, but you can feel comfortable in passing on it, as well.

The story is apparently based on a true one (as per the opening screen statement) but it is from the pen of Dan Gilroy that the well-drawn characters are realized.  DJ Caruso (Smallville, The Salton Sea, The Shield) knows his way around matters such as these and his pacing is fine, allowing for the isolated 'arias' in the film to work well.  The problem, for this viewer, is the topic: how interesting can bilking chronic gamblers over football game wagers possibly be?The story is related by Brandon Long (Matthew McConaughey) who begins life as a sports hero and just at the moment when he is ready to break in to the Pro Football domain, he fractures his leg in a winning touchdown. Six years later, and still dreaming of making it as a player of football, finds him in the numbers game with a talent for picking winning teams and calling 900 numbers to urge gullible people t place bets according to his predictions.  Enter Alter Abrams (Al Pacino), a recovering Gambler who is making it big in the sports gambling arena.  He coerces Brandon to join him in New York, wines him, dines him with the aid of his smart and beautiful wife Toni (Rene Russo), and in no time Brandon Long takes on the persona of John Anthony and makes it big as a TV personality who successfully bilks willing gambling people out of their money.  Long as Anthony takes on a life of his own and it is the conflagration between the creator Abrams and the prot&eacute;g&eacute; Anthony that fleshes out the film.Interesting to a point, the story loses steam in the last half and we soon lose interest in the outcome or the characters. And not that that is the fault of the actors!  Al Pacino is very effective as the reformed gambler still fighting demons and Rene Russo is as beautiful as ever, acting her role with complete conviction and holding what is left of the story, once started, together.  Matthew McConaughey spends much of the movie without his shirt on which is a major contribution to the visuals of the film!  Buff and beautiful he manages to keep the heart of Brandon Long beating inside the persona of John Anthony.Not a great movie by any means, but some truly fine acting from the trio of stars.  The supporting cast also gives solid roles despite the skimpy script.  If gambling of any sort, and sports gambling in particular, is of interest to you, then this is a movie to recommend. Otherwise see it for the actors, not the story.

He instead winds up picking winners for gamblers via a 900 phone line in Vegas.His picks are so good, in fact, that he draws the attention of Pacino, in New York, who wants him to come work for him in Nwe York where he ""sells"" advice to big-money betters.If any of you are picking up on some strange similarities between this film and ""The Devil's Advocate"", poo-poo you.  There's nothing strange about it at all, it's a formula that works.  Pacino is one of the most charismatic actors ever.  Watching him bewitch the innocent costar is the draw of these movies.  It worked in ""Advocate"", it worked in ""The Recruit"" and it works here.The thing that doesn't work here is the fact that we see the pattern so early in the movie that the effect wears off too soon to keep the plot twists from being telegraphed two scenes ahead.Pacino hires McConaughey as a golden boy of football picks.  We never really know why he's so good, at least not enough to understand why he starts losing.  At first we're lead to think that it's because he's gotten too cocky about his talent, but when his character humbles himself to ""get back to it"", he still continues to lose.  He wants to quit, Pacino won't let him.  One of their biggest clients stops McConnaughey while he's out for a bike ride, holds him down, and urinates on him for making bad picks that weekend, and McConnaughey not only fails to share this information with his mentor, but we never hear another word about it.  He's threatened with violence against his family back home if he doesn't start picking winners, but we never hear about that anymore (even when he loses big again the next week).Lots of build up, not much follow through.  However two things keep this movie very watchable.First is, naturally, the performanes.  McConnaughey does well with a fairly one-dimensional character because he is very likable and good-looking.  Pacino is everybody's favorite bravura performer, and he answers the call in every scene.  Rene Russo is quite good as Pacino's wife, who serves as a voice of reason for the egos of both men several times.The second draw is that we see Pacino as a superpower who ultimately proves quite vulnerable.  When his empire begins to crumble, he doesn't get to go the Corleone route and just kill more people.  He eventually has to face his demons, and he does so with a restraint and modesty rarely afforded him in ""Al Pacino"" roles such as this.",3,Two for the Spotlight,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,2799,"['plot', 'Two', 'Money', 'moral', 'are', 'subplots', 'are', 'even', 'other', 'people', 'screen', 'three', 'leads', 'However', 'things', 'are', 'simply', 'scenery', 'Pacino', 'McConaughey', 'are', 'eating', 'contest.McConaughey', 'would-have-been', 'football', 'hero', 'zapped', 'potential', 'pro-ball', 'career', 'college-game', 'injury', 'instead', 'up', 'picking', 'winners', 'gamblers', '900', 'phone', 'line', 'Vegas.His', 'picks', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'fact', 'attention', 'Pacino', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'come', 'work', 'Nwe', 'York', 'where', 'advice', 'big-money', 'betters.If', 'are', 'picking', 'up', 'strange', 'similarities', 'film', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'poo-poo', 'nothing', 'strange', 'formula', 'Pacino', 'one', 'most', 'charismatic', 'actors', 'ever', 'Watching', 'bewitch', 'innocent', 'costar', 'draw', 'movies', 'worked', 'Advocate', 'worked', 'Recruit', 'here.The', 'thing', ""n't"", 'work', 'here', 'fact', 'see', 'pattern', 'so', 'early', 'movie', 'effect', 'too', 'soon', 'keep', 'plot', 'twists', 'being', 'telegraphed', 'two', 'scenes', 'ahead.Pacino', 'McConaughey', 'golden', 'boy', 'football', 'picks', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'why', 'so', 'good', 'least', 'not', 'enough', 'understand', 'why', 'losing', 'first', ""'re"", 'lead', 'think', 'gotten', 'too', 'cocky', 'talent', 'when', 'character', 'get', 'back', 'still', 'lose', 'quit', 'Pacino', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'One', 'biggest', 'clients', 'McConnaughey', 'out', 'bike', 'ride', 'down', 'urinates', 'making', 'bad', 'picks', 'weekend', 'McConnaughey', 'not', 'only', 'share', 'information', 'mentor', 'never', 'hear', 'word', 'threatened', 'violence', 'family', 'back', 'home', ""n't"", 'start', 'picking', 'winners', 'never', 'hear', 'anymore', 'even', 'when', 'big', 'again', 'next', 'week', '.Lots', 'build', 'up', 'not', 'much', 'follow', 'However', 'two', 'things', 'keep', 'movie', 'very', 'watchable.First', 'naturally', 'performanes', 'McConnaughey', 'well', 'fairly', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'very', 'likable', 'good-looking', 'Pacino', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'bravura', 'performer', 'call', 'scene', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'quite', 'good', 'Pacino', 'wife', 'who', 'voice', 'reason', 'egos', 'men', 'several', 'times.The', 'second', 'draw', 'see', 'Pacino', 'superpower', 'who', 'ultimately', 'quite', 'vulnerable', 'When', 'empire', 'crumble', ""n't"", 'get', 'go', 'Corleone', 'route', 'just', 'kill', 'more', 'people', 'eventually', 'face', 'demons', 'so', 'restraint', 'modesty', 'rarely', 'afforded', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'roles', 'such']",N/A
955943,A2VRAT69JDAD3W,B000CBCWRG,"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister""","[12, 16]","There's no easy way around it.  ""Two For The Money"" is a bad movie.  A very bad movie.  It pains me to say this for the following reasons.  I'm an avid, life long sports fan and a great admirer of both Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey's work.Alas, the film is a formula ""hick in the big city"" tale that revolves around the shark-like world of sports booking.  McConaughey plays Brandon, a young studly former athlete who possesses a gift for making game picks on the 900 lines in Vegas.  Pacino plays Walter, the chain smoking kingpin owner of a sports book advice line with an addictive personality.  Walter catches wind of Brandon's abilities and woos him to New York to polish the diamond in the rough and make him his next golden boy.  Sound interesting?  It's not.Clearly poor dialogue shares the blame, but McConaughey delivers a disappointingly shallow, paper thin performance that offers nothing for the viewer to sink his teeth into.  You get the obligatory hickory smoked drawl and charming grin, some bad hair, a few gratuitous shots of his pecs and not much else.  Likewise, Pacino's role is overacted, stale, stock and downright cartoonish at times.  (Think ""The Devil's Advocate"" or ""Any Given Sunday"".)  Rene Russo is utterly forgettable as Pacino's concerned, salon owning wife.The film fails miserably at creating an interesting or believable depiction of its characters and the world in which they exist.  Every aspect of the film has a contrived artificial feel.  The few sports scenes that are in the film are almost comically unconvincing.  But worst of all, the story never really seems to find its voice, leaving the viewer to wonder what the heck the movie is trying to say.  By the end of the film the viewer answers his own question by saying ""I really don't care.""",1,Avoiding This Film Is A Safe Bet.,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,1792,"['easy', 'way', 'Two', 'Money', 'bad', 'movie', 'very', 'bad', 'movie', 'say', 'following', 'reasons', ""'m"", 'avid', 'life', 'long', 'sports', 'fan', 'great', 'admirer', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'work.Alas', 'film', 'formula', 'hick', 'big', 'city', 'tale', 'shark-like', 'world', 'sports', 'booking', 'McConaughey', 'Brandon', 'young', 'studly', 'former', 'athlete', 'who', 'gift', 'making', 'game', 'picks', '900', 'lines', 'Vegas', 'Pacino', 'Walter', 'chain', 'smoking', 'kingpin', 'owner', 'sports', 'book', 'advice', 'line', 'addictive', 'personality', 'Walter', 'wind', 'Brandon', 'abilities', 'woos', 'New', 'York', 'polish', 'diamond', 'rough', 'make', 'next', 'golden', 'boy', 'Sound', 'interesting', 'not.Clearly', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'shares', 'blame', 'McConaughey', 'disappointingly', 'shallow', 'paper', 'thin', 'performance', 'nothing', 'viewer', 'sink', 'teeth', 'get', 'obligatory', 'hickory', 'smoked', 'drawl', 'charming', 'grin', 'bad', 'hair', 'few', 'gratuitous', 'shots', 'pecs', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Likewise', 'Pacino', 'role', 'overacted', 'stale', 'stock', 'downright', 'cartoonish', 'times', 'Think', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'Pacino', 'concerned', 'salon', 'owning', 'wife.The', 'film', 'miserably', 'creating', 'interesting', 'believable', 'depiction', 'characters', 'world', 'exist', 'aspect', 'film', 'contrived', 'artificial', 'feel', 'few', 'sports', 'scenes', 'are', 'film', 'are', 'almost', 'comically', 'unconvincing', 'worst', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'find', 'voice', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'what', 'heck', 'movie', 'trying', 'say', 'end', 'film', 'viewer', 'own', 'question', 'saying', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care']",N/A

955945,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000CBCWRG,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 1]","Sports movies are always very popular in Hollywood and with movie audiences.  We all love to watch these types of films, especially when based on actual events.  Though many directors have made films focusing on the various sports or teams within them, such as ""Remember the Titans"", ""Any Given Sunday"", and ""Miracle"" to name a few, I can't think of a time when a director made a film based around sports, but not actually dealing with sports.  The subject of ""Two For the Money"" is based around the world of sports, but not in that world, instead it's focus is on the high-stakes sports gambling that occurs during every sports season.""Two For the Money"" is the story of a former football player, Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey), who had such a bright future in the pro football world until a knee injury permanently side-lined him.  Now, Brandon works as a small time sports gambling tipster, he compiles the data on all the teams and makes an educated pick as to who the winner will be, and from there people use his information to place their bets.  After gaining some recognition for his uncanny ability to pick the winner almost 80% of the time, Brandon is approached by Walter Abrams (Al Pacino), who owns and operates his own highly-profitable sports tipping firm.  Seeing the limitless potential in Brandon, Walter takes him on as his protege, with hopes of grooming Brandon to take over the business due to Walter's bad heart condition.  As the money and power, not to mention Walter's own charisma, begin to overwhelm Brandon, he soon finds himself no longer recognizing who he truly is anymore.  To make matters worse, Brandon's lust for power and prestige has made him cocky and he no longer focuses on his work and begins a long losing streak that costs his company and their customers, the gamblers, millions of dollars.  Now with his back against the wall, and no one on his side, Brandon must decide whether to let himself be overtaken by the greed that is consuming him, or walk away from the sports betting world forever and reclaim himself.Gambling has always been a taboo topic, especially in terms of sports, and it's really nice to see that ""Two For the Money"" isn't afraid to deal with the highs and lows of that world.  All it takes is a streak of luck for a person to amass huge sums of wealth, but in an instant all of that wealth can be stripped away by man's greed.  The lead actors, Pacino and McConaughey, both turn in outstanding performances and you really grow to enjoy the characters and become involved in their lives.  The supporting cast led by Rene Russo (""Ransom"" and ""The Thomas Crowne Affair"") and Jeremy Piven (HBO's ""Entourage"") are excellent as the supportive yet tough wife and and an arrogant tipster, respectively.  Many critics have panned the film for feeling overly long, and the characters are too generalized.  I feel that maybe the film could have been trimmed down a tiny bit, but the length doesn't really bother me, and the characters are all very 3-dimensional and realistic without falling prey to stereotypes.If you're a fan of a mature, well-written drama with top-notch performances then you should really watch ""Two For the Money"".

Soon, he is brought into sports better Al Pacino (Scarface, People I Know) and his world where Pacino shows him the ropes, gives him a fancy office with weights so he can work out and do other stuff, also change his name from Brandon Lang to John Anthony to give him character, little edge and a name everyone will remember. Then, Matthew gets really into it and I mean really into it and Pacino's wife, played by Rene Russo (Get Shorty, Ransom) who looks good, also gets into the mix. Not bad movie with a superb cast including a wild Pacino and come on, when doesnt Pacino go crazy in his movies and McConaughey does his usual thing and he looks fit and healthy. Movie drags leaving some of the energy out the window but still entertaining fueled by the two lead actors performances. Also starring Jaime King (Sin City, Happy Campers) and Jeremy Piven (Grosse Pointe Blank, The Family Man) in another supporting role. Inspired by a true story......when isnt it?",3,Pacino and McConaughey give good performances despite lack of energy,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,1324,"['Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Sahara', 'Frailty', 'movie', 'telling', 'story', 'how', 'father', 'brought', 'world', 'sports', 'taught', 'how', 'play', 'baseball', 'football', 'basketball', 'then', 'father', 'left', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'So', 'years', 'later', 'Matthew', 'became', 'quarterback', 'football', 'team', 'when', 'broken', 'leg', 'ended', 'career', 'went', 'sales', 'Soon', 'brought', 'sports', 'better', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Scarface', 'People', 'Know', 'world', 'where', 'Pacino', 'ropes', 'fancy', 'office', 'weights', 'can', 'work', 'out', 'do', 'other', 'stuff', 'also', 'change', 'name', 'Brandon', 'Lang', 'John', 'Anthony', 'give', 'character', 'little', 'edge', 'name', 'everyone', 'will', 'remember', 'Then', 'Matthew', 'really', 'mean', 'really', 'Pacino', 'wife', 'played', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'Get', 'Shorty', 'Ransom', 'who', 'good', 'also', 'mix', 'Not', 'bad', 'movie', 'superb', 'cast', 'including', 'wild', 'Pacino', 'come', 'when', 'doesnt', 'Pacino', 'go', 'crazy', 'movies', 'McConaughey', 'usual', 'thing', 'fit', 'healthy', 'Movie', 'leaving', 'energy', 'window', 'still', 'entertaining', 'fueled', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'performances', 'Also', 'starring', 'Jaime', 'King', 'Sin', 'City', 'Happy', 'Campers', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'Family', 'Man', 'supporting', 'role', 'Inspired', 'true', 'story', 'when', 'isnt']",N/A

The underground, secret world sports betting.Al Pacino and Matthew McConaghey star in this movie working at a small office dealing with aggressive betters putting trust in their hands.This film feels a little too much like Boiler Room. Matthew McConaghey is like the Giovanni Ribsi. He's the new hotshot w/a lot of potential at what the firm is looking for. McConaghey's character knows football front to back being able to pick winners like picking groceries.He's on fire and is noticed by Al Pacino, who runs this small betting office in New York. Pacino hires him and McConaghey starts earning the office some big bucks as taking and making bets.But things start to go wrong when his good-luck streak in his career starts to fumble downwards. He's not picking the winners and the firm is losing some big bucks.The film takes a real turn from gaining power to losing power. Think of it like a pyramid. The top of the pyramid is when McConaghey picked a big winner in a popular Monday Night Football game earning the firm millions and millions of $$$. His luck is jinxed and all that money is being lost.Rene Russo also co-stars as Pacino's wife who you can tell is starting to get tired of him. His healh is low and he spends all his time at work leaving her as the stereotypical, tired of my hubby working, housewife.Pacino's performance is, of course, great. He's got the same sense of power and aggressiveness that he had years ago with Scarface and The Godfather.See this now while football season lasts!

Caruso (The Salton Sea, Taking Lives) and featuring Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey, the film takes place in the world of high risk sports betting.  McConaughey plays Brandon Lang, a once promising quarterback turned betting tipper, whose talents catch the eye of Walter Abrams (Pacino), who runs a sports betting empire and aims to make Lang his protege.  Soon enough, Brandon is living and breathing the New York lifestyle, making loads of money, and scoring all the right moves with Walter and his wife Toni (Rene Russo), until naturally, it all starts to crumble downwards.  Two For the Money has a glossy look and Pacino and McConaughey make a formidable pair, but after the first half of the film, everything just seems to veer in the opposite direction.  The characters become more self-centered, and things become even more implausible.  Despite that though, Pacino and McConaughey are great to watch here, and Entourage's Jeremy Piven is great in a small role, and Armand Assante has plenty of menace as a wealthy gangster who loses a bit of cash.

By the middle of the film I was actually interested in the subject matter of sports betting. The entire cast is superb. the script was fast and snappy, never predictable and always interesting. Pacino in particular made the subject matter exciting because he played his character so well. His character, Walter, stakes his life and passion on the profession and he constantly looks for energy and excitement in that kind of work. The intensity of sports betting, the stresses of it, and the quick pace of the lifestyle transfered well to the screen. I really enjoyed this film the second time around.

It told three different stories:  one about sports gambling; one about a shaky marriage (Pacino and Russo); and one about a confused, misdirected youth (McConaughey). The movie tried to mix the three and make it interesting but failed on every levels. (Unless you are into sports gambling.)Al Pacino use to be a great actor and I have always looked forward to seeing his movies. But for the last several years (since Devil's Advocate) all he does in his movies is spew out philosophy in a loud, preachy voice. I wish he would get back to some real acting. Rene Russo played the perplexed wife that could have been played by any of a few dozen actresses. Matthew McConaughey put a real effort into his part and I give him an A for effort. I have never been a big fan of Matthew McConaughey but he is climbing slowly up that ladder.Armand Assante deserves honorable mention.

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[3, 5]","Two For The Money is about a former athlete (Matthew McConaughey) with a leg injured playing college football, who works recording messages for 900 numbers in Las Vegas.  He specializes in picking football games for gamblers since he has a knack for it.  Soon he gets a call from a professional handicapper in New York (Al Pacino) who offers him a job there.  It's very interesting to see how they work.  Pacino has a TV show with 900 numbers on the bottom of the screen, and bettors call in to get free advice.  He has a team of salesmen who field  calls, but only a few expert touts like McConaughey, who quickly rises to the top.  But of course you have the common sense about gambling, which the characters lack, to know he can't stay on top.  His relationship with Pacino's character reminds me of the latter's character in The Devil's Advocate, though this film doesn't take any supernatural turns.  The ending is surprisingly not bad.I agree with the sentiment in another review here - gratuitous discussions about (and liberally using) the ""f"" word were added in as though borrowed from an old George Carlin routine because the writer couldn't think of anything original and clever to fill in the slow parts of the story.

Writer Dan Gilroy and director D.J Caruso try on a couple of subplots, then brush em off their shoulders. A sense of intimacy isn't there - you can't smell the smoke or sense the sweat of the industry.It stars Al Pacino in a mannered, showy performance of polished looks and false bravado. But it too is missing something. Maybe that dexterity with numbers required to build a sports betting empire. Pacino has more thoughtful, introverted speeds -see ""The Insider"" or ""Insomnia"" - but here he's made some boring, typical choices.Pacino is Walter Abrams, a New Yorker running a fairly profitable operation out of a brownstone when he discovers a former college quarterback, Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey) is hitting 80 percent of his picks on some anonymous Las Vegas line. Brandon buys Walter's pitch, and, for a couple months, he's a rousing success. The book of business builds, and Brandon gets a makeover and new persona for TV.  Walter tabs him his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, sees him as a son. Walter's wife Toni (Rene Russo) is a bit wiser. She advises Brandon to be wary, and eventually to get out of the business entirely.The coupling begins to sour not long after Brandon and Walter have a sitdown with a million-dollar bettor (Armand Assante, effective). Greed sweats out of Walter's pores and when Brandon hits a cold streak through his own carelessness, the mentor reveals the darkest shadows of his character. Really he's pretty reprehensible. Here's a man that's been moving in the waters so long his decisions are immersed in the love of money, acquiring it, and blowing it. ""I'm a lemon,"" he says at one point, and indeed every penny he earns he pretends is the last in his world. It's a horrible sentence, one destined for bankruptcy, and although Toni seems to know that, she's loyal. Why? We never learn.McConaughey gets carried along in the stream, his character making odd right turns. You think something's up with him when, in fact, nothing is. Brandon learns Walter has been blocking his deadbeat dad's phone calls. The subplot goes nowhere. Brandon has a mom and brother. They disappear. Brandon meets a pretty girl. She wants nothing to do with him. Another cute girl in the office likes Brandon. Zippo.  Eventually the script employs Brandon as a cipher to solve Walter's jealousy issue.He's not aging handsomely, McConaughey - here he looks worn and overtanned - nor is he building a acting niche for himself when those looks finally wave bye-bye. In recent years Pacino has been paired with actors willing to go toe-to-toe with him: Johnny Depp, Russell Crowe, Robin Williams, even Jamie Foxx in ""Any Given Sunday."" No such greatness here.

Therefore Pacino gives him the F word education.The acting is actually pretty good. The storyline is okay, but this ain't another Wall Street movie or anything like that.

You probably could've replaced the gambling with any other addiction without losing much.  Though ""Two for the Money"" is easier to sit through than ""Barfly.""Al Pacino is scary intense as Walter Abrams, a big money betting agent who takes Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey), under his wing. Brandon's a college ball player whose career had been cut short by a broken leg and who was having incredible success predicting wins on 900 sports betting lines before Abrams found him.If you're expecting a sports comeback movie, get something like ""Invincible."" ""Two for the Money"" is more about Walter slowly wearing down Brandon into compromising every one of his values, eventually taking away his identity (his name even is changed), until he's just Walter's predicting machine.  Then the film depicts Brandon's eventual recovery after the machine begins to fail.I thought Pacino did a good job humanizing Walter's character, since it often seemed the director/screenwriter wanted him to be the devil himself.  (I guess it could've been vice-versa.)Rene Russo is good as Walter's wife, Toni, who puts up with the two's bickering, and flirts a little too much with Brandon.  Her exchanges with Walter during his paranoid, jealous rants are probably the best thing about the film.Also worth mentioning is Entourage's Jeremy Piven, who turns in another weak, Cusack-less performance as arrogant, longtime employee Jerry, who feels threatened by Brandon's winning streak. For a while, it looks as if the rivalry will lead to something bigger, but Walter fires Jerry not even ten seconds into their first big argument -- I suspect because the director realized Piven was incompetent.Also, Gedde Watanabe (""Sixteen Candles"") makes a short, funny appearance as a limo driver.McConaughey takes off his shirt several times.There's a brief interview with the writer Dan Gilroy and the ""Real"" Brandon Lang on the DVD, which should be interesting to both sports fans and filmmakers (maybe even caddies), even if you aren't able to make it through the whole feature.As far as the big game tomorrow, I predict: Heads",3,Failure to Communicate,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,2182,"[""n't"", 'really', 'sports', 'movie', 'so-so', 'morality', 'tale', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'probably', 'could', ""'ve"", 'replaced', 'gambling', 'other', 'addiction', 'losing', 'much', 'Two', 'Money', 'easier', 'sit', 'Barfly', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'scary', 'intense', 'Walter', 'Abrams', 'big', 'money', 'betting', 'agent', 'who', 'Brandon', 'Lang', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'wing', 'Brandon', 'college', 'ball', 'player', 'career', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'short', 'broken', 'leg', 'who', 'was', 'having', 'incredible', 'success', 'predicting', 'wins', '900', 'sports', 'betting', 'lines', 'Abrams', 'found', 'him.If', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'sports', 'comeback', 'movie', 'get', 'something', 'Invincible', 'Two', 'Money', 'more', 'Walter', 'slowly', 'wearing', 'down', 'Brandon', 'compromising', 'one', 'values', 'eventually', 'taking', 'away', 'identity', 'name', 'even', 'changed', 'just', 'Walter', 'predicting', 'machine', 'Then', 'film', 'Brandon', 'eventual', 'recovery', 'machine', 'fail.I', 'thought', 'Pacino', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'humanizing', 'Walter', 'character', 'often', 'seemed', 'director/screenwriter', 'wanted', 'be', 'devil', 'guess', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'vice-versa', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'good', 'Walter', 'wife', 'Toni', 'who', 'up', 'two', 'bickering', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Brandon', 'exchanges', 'Walter', 'paranoid', 'jealous', 'rants', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'film.Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Entourage', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'who', 'weak', 'Cusack-less', 'performance', 'arrogant', 'longtime', 'employee', 'Jerry', 'who', 'feels', 'threatened', 'Brandon', 'winning', 'streak', 'while', 'rivalry', 'will', 'lead', 'something', 'bigger', 'Walter', 'fires', 'Jerry', 'not', 'even', 'ten', 'seconds', 'first', 'big', 'argument', 'suspect', 'director', 'realized', 'Piven', 'was', 'incompetent.Also', 'Gedde', 'Watanabe', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'short', 'funny', 'appearance', 'limo', 'driver.McConaughey', 'shirt', 'several', 'brief', 'interview', 'writer', 'Dan', 'Gilroy', 'Real', 'Brandon', 'Lang', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'interesting', 'sports', 'fans', 'filmmakers', 'maybe', 'even', 'caddies', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'make', 'whole', 'feature.As', 'far', 'big', 'game', 'tomorrow', 'predict', 'Heads']",N/A

CarusoCast:  Al Pacino, Matthew McConaughey, Rene Russo, Armand Assante, Jeremy Piven, Jaime King, Kevin Chapman, Ralph Garman.Running Time:  122 minutesRated R for pervasive language, a scene of sexuality and a violent act.After losing his shot at playing professional football, Brandon Lang (Mathew McConaughey) falls into work at a Las Vegas telephone sports betting hotline. Enjoying success, Brandon soon finds himself with a lucrative job offer from Walter Abrams (Al Pacino) to come to New York City and join his popular sports betting consulting agency. Renaming himself John Anthony and adopting a confidence his clients cannot resist, Brandon reaches the heights of the underworld with his amazing forecasting abilities, only to find the temptations (including Rene Russo) of his lifestyle more dangerous than his clients.  Director D.J. Caruso has made a name for himself guiding projects riddled with clich&eacute;s, and making something interesting, if imperfect, out of the raw materials (""The Salton Sea,"" ""Taking Lives""). ""Two for the Money"" is where Caruso's luck starts to fail him. A hackneyed tale of the rise and fall of a superstar sports prognosticator, ""Money"" doesn't have the dramatic gas to see itself to the end.That's not to say there aren't any thrills in watching ""Money"" run through the motions; the birth of Brandon as an important figure in his field is an entertaining one, and Dan Gilroy's script illustrates to the audience a distinctive portrait of Walter's consulting empire, and its feverish following of gambling addicts. As Brandon makes his transformation into John Anthony, Caruso gets the details (the style, the talk, the ease) right, trusting his cast to understand these desperate, yet confident characters, and allowing them to run with their performances. With a cast list this strong, it should come as no surprise that the performances are the least of the film's problems.  Even Al Pacino gives, for a majority of the film, a rich, nuanced performance unlike any of his recent grandstanding. He's terrific and genuine in his early scenes of revelation where Walter comes close to finding his knight in shining armor in Brandon.However, like all great cinematic tales of success, what comes up must come down. Gilroy's script falls into deep formula and stalls as we watch Brandon's tumble from grace with the already lethargic plot elongated to the two-hour mark for no real reason. This part of the film delves the most into the addiction themes of the film, but Caruso confronts them so awkwardly, it's tough to get behind the compulsions and subsequent feelings of emptiness. As ""Money"" sniffs around looking for something to do, Pacino's performance gets louder, which is always a sure sign the actor is looking to overcompensate for a weak script. Sadly, his instincts are dead on here.  Like the insurance policies they are, McConaughey, Pacino, and Russo save ""Two for the Money"" from swallowing itself in clich&eacute; and misplaced passion. Caruso uses them wisely, but he can't direct his way around what amounts to a very tired screenplay for a very vibrant underground world.",2,Two for the Money  (2005),1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,3156,"['Director', 'D.J', 'CarusoCast', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Jaime', 'King', 'Kevin', 'Chapman', 'Ralph', 'Garman.Running', 'Time', '122', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'pervasive', 'language', 'scene', 'sexuality', 'violent', 'act.After', 'losing', 'shot', 'playing', 'professional', 'football', 'Brandon', 'Lang', 'Mathew', 'McConaughey', 'work', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'telephone', 'sports', 'betting', 'hotline', 'Enjoying', 'success', 'Brandon', 'soon', 'lucrative', 'job', 'offer', 'Walter', 'Abrams', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'come', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'join', 'popular', 'sports', 'betting', 'consulting', 'agency', 'Renaming', 'John', 'Anthony', 'adopting', 'confidence', 'clients', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'Brandon', 'heights', 'underworld', 'amazing', 'forecasting', 'abilities', 'only', 'find', 'temptations', 'including', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'lifestyle', 'more', 'dangerous', 'clients', 'Director', 'D.J', 'Caruso', 'made', 'name', 'guiding', 'projects', 'riddled', 'clich', 'eacute', 'making', 'something', 'interesting', 'imperfect', 'raw', 'materials', 'Salton', 'Sea', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'Two', 'Money', 'where', 'Caruso', 'luck', 'fail', 'hackneyed', 'tale', 'rise', 'fall', 'superstar', 'sports', 'prognosticator', 'Money', ""n't"", 'have', 'dramatic', 'gas', 'see', 'end.That', 'not', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'thrills', 'watching', 'Money', 'run', 'motions', 'birth', 'Brandon', 'important', 'figure', 'field', 'entertaining', 'one', 'Dan', 'Gilroy', 'script', 'audience', 'distinctive', 'portrait', 'Walter', 'consulting', 'empire', 'feverish', 'following', 'gambling', 'addicts', 'Brandon', 'transformation', 'John', 'Anthony', 'Caruso', 'details', 'style', 'talk', 'ease', 'right', 'trusting', 'cast', 'understand', 'desperate', 'confident', 'characters', 'allowing', 'run', 'performances', 'cast', 'list', 'strong', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'performances', 'are', 'least', 'film', 'problems', 'Even', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'majority', 'film', 'rich', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'recent', 'grandstanding', 'terrific', 'genuine', 'early', 'scenes', 'revelation', 'where', 'Walter', 'close', 'finding', 'knight', 'shining', 'armor', 'Brandon.However', 'great', 'cinematic', 'tales', 'success', 'what', 'up', 'must', 'come', 'down', 'Gilroy', 'script', 'deep', 'formula', 'stalls', 'watch', 'Brandon', 'tumble', 'grace', 'already', 'lethargic', 'plot', 'elongated', 'two-hour', 'mark', 'real', 'reason', 'part', 'film', 'most', 'addiction', 'themes', 'film', 'Caruso', 'so', 'awkwardly', 'tough', 'get', 'compulsions', 'subsequent', 'feelings', 'emptiness', 'Money', 'sniffs', 'looking', 'something', 'do', 'Pacino', 'performance', 'louder', 'always', 'sure', 'sign', 'actor', 'looking', 'overcompensate', 'weak', 'script', 'Sadly', 'instincts', 'are', 'dead', 'here', 'insurance', 'policies', 'are', 'McConaughey', 'Pacino', 'Russo', 'save', 'Two', 'Money', 'swallowing', 'clich', 'eacute', 'misplaced', 'passion', 'Caruso', 'wisely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'direct', 'way', 'what', 'amounts', 'very', 'tired', 'screenplay', 'very', 'vibrant', 'underground', 'world']",N/A

955977,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000CBCWRG,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","`Two for the Money,' it is said, is inspired by true story, but the story about a washed-out football player, fast track to success, and its consequence, is not an original one. The difference is that the film features Al Pacino, known for frequently playing man of power, and he plays Walter Abrams, a power-hungry head of a telephone service giving advice for sports betting, and organizing his own cable TV show giving tips for the audiences eager to listen.In `Two for the Money' Walter takes ex-college football player Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey) as prot&eacute;g&eacute;, to use the latter's knowledge and experience as former star QB. As Brandon (under an alias) shows unexpected skills and charisma as ""sports advisor"", the master-pupil relations between Walter and Brandon gets more complicated especially when Walter's wife Toni (Rene Russo), concerned about her husband's failing health, realizes that the master's influence over the pupil is not always a desirable one.`Two for the Money' is not exactly about gambling. The film may remind you of `Wall Street,' but `Two for the Money' has almost no social commentary on the world of sports betting. The workers at Walter's office do not worry themselves, thinking ""Is there any `system' to predict the results of the games?"" (except the one played by Jeremy Piven). Walter insists that Brandon should keep pushing, but despite the nice, witty dialogues between them (including the ones about f-word) in the first half of the film, the business and sales pitch depicted here are nothing particularly intriguing.Al Pacino shows a very flamboyant performance as in `The Recruit' and `The Devil's Advocate' and he is surely attractive before McConaughey who is OK. But Pacino's magnetic presence starts to look weaker in the second half where the film gets more and more unfocused with too much clich&eacute; going on. In short, director D. J. Caruso who showed flair for storytelling in `Taking Lives' cannot decide on the story he should tell here. What does Walter want from Brandon? What does Brandon want from Toni? What does Toni want from Walter and Brandon? And most of all, what does Brandon, whose life we followed so far, really want to do? Before the film gives the answers, we start to lose interest.`Two for the Money' is entertaining up to a point with the three leads who are always watchable. But the script's point gets fuzzy and vague as the film goes on, slowly moving away from the moderately interesting world of sports betting and the mentor-pupil theme, leaving us far behind.",3,"(2.5 STARS) Pacino and McConaughey in the World of Sports Betting: Intriguing At First, But Then More and More Muddled",1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,2566,"['Two', 'Money', 'said', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'story', 'washed-out', 'football', 'player', 'fast', 'track', 'success', 'consequence', 'not', 'original', 'one', 'difference', 'film', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'known', 'frequently', 'playing', 'man', 'power', 'Walter', 'Abrams', 'power-hungry', 'head', 'telephone', 'service', 'giving', 'advice', 'sports', 'betting', 'organizing', 'own', 'cable', 'TV', 'show', 'giving', 'tips', 'audiences', 'eager', 'listen.In', 'Two', 'Money', 'Walter', 'ex-college', 'football', 'player', 'Brandon', 'Lang', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'use', 'latter', 'knowledge', 'experience', 'former', 'star', 'QB', 'Brandon', 'alias', 'unexpected', 'skills', 'charisma', 'sports', 'advisor', 'master-pupil', 'relations', 'Walter', 'Brandon', 'more', 'complicated', 'especially', 'when', 'Walter', 'wife', 'Toni', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'concerned', 'husband', 'failing', 'health', 'master', 'influence', 'pupil', 'not', 'always', 'desirable', 'one.', 'Two', 'Money', 'not', 'exactly', 'gambling', 'film', 'may', 'remind', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Two', 'Money', 'almost', 'social', 'commentary', 'world', 'sports', 'betting', 'workers', 'Walter', 'office', 'do', 'not', 'worry', 'thinking', 'system', 'predict', 'results', 'games', 'one', 'played', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Walter', 'Brandon', 'should', 'keep', 'pushing', 'nice', 'witty', 'dialogues', 'including', 'ones', 'f-word', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'business', 'sales', 'pitch', 'depicted', 'here', 'are', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'intriguing.Al', 'Pacino', 'very', 'flamboyant', 'performance', 'Recruit', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'surely', 'attractive', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'OK', 'Pacino', 'magnetic', 'presence', 'look', 'weaker', 'second', 'half', 'where', 'film', 'more', 'more', 'unfocused', 'too', 'much', 'clich', 'eacute', 'going', 'short', 'director', 'D.', 'J.', 'Caruso', 'who', 'showed', 'flair', 'storytelling', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'can', 'not', 'decide', 'story', 'should', 'tell', 'here', 'What', 'Walter', 'want', 'Brandon', 'What', 'Brandon', 'want', 'Toni', 'What', 'Toni', 'want', 'Walter', 'Brandon', 'most', 'what', 'Brandon', 'life', 'followed', 'so', 'far', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'film', 'answers', 'start', 'lose', 'interest.', 'Two', 'Money', 'entertaining', 'up', 'point', 'three', 'leads', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'watchable', 'script', 'point', 'fuzzy', 'vague', 'film', 'slowly', 'moving', 'away', 'moderately', 'interesting', 'world', 'sports', 'betting', 'mentor-pupil', 'theme', 'leaving', 'far']",N/A
