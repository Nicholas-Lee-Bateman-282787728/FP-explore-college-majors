I was impressed with the scenery of the old country. Many of these places I have visited as a youth and as an adult. Edvard Grieg's music describes the love and adoration he had for his country. Listening to his music I can picture in my mind the beauty of Norway's picturesque, breathtaking landscape; i.e. fjords, forests, waterfalls and mountains.Toralv Maurstad plays the famous Norwegian composer, struggling to gain fame and fortune through his music. While many of his countrymen thought of him as a failure, he gained the respect of the famous Norwegian poet, playwright and dramatist Henrik Ibsen who, his home was in the town of Grimstad where my paternal family came from, asks Grieg to compose music for his play ""Peer Gynt"" that has become one of the best known musical scores in the world today: ""Peer Gynt Suite I"" Op. 46, and ""Peer Gynt Suite II"" Op. 55, each with four movements. The opening theme ""Morning Mood"" and the third movement ""Anitra's Dance"" are the most popular themes.Another Norwegian, Richard Nordraak, who wrote Norway's national anthem ""Ja Vi Elsker Dette Landet"" (Yes We Love This Land), becomes a close friend of Grieg by exposing his music and pulling a few strings with well-known people such as Hans Christian Andersen. Florence Henderson certainly was the perfect choice as Grieg's cousin and wife, Nina, with her beautiful singing voice and talent.While many still criticize Grieg's works, there are many more who admire this great composer's love for Norway reflected through his numerous Small Piano Pieces, his famous ""Piano Concerto in A minor"" Op. 16, and ""In Autumn"" Op. 11.

446125,A1SRHEN9AHMC96,6305074070,Karl Hess,"[18, 20]","Rarely has a legitimate theatre musical been so carefully and lovingly transferred to the big, wide screen.  The creators researched their  material meticulously and while certain liberties were taken for dramatic  enhancement, many of the historical events portrayed were authentic and  consistent in spirit with Grieg's life.This was originally a  broadway production from the operetta venue and while some of the original  numbers were dropped, many new numbers were added which enriched the  story.But most of all, this is a glorious musical.  The scenery is  breathtaking, filmed in many of the original locations where the events  took place.  The choreography and music set a new standard in support of  the musical numbers.  The singing is glorious.  Florence Henderson is  wonderful as Nina Grieg.  Her voice is a pure, heartwarming soprano.  Remember that she was a musical-comedy star of considerable stature long  before the Brady Bunch.  Frank Poretta is charismatic as Richard Nordraak,  Grieg's long time friend and gives us a rich, powerful voice to boot.  Torav Maurstad is Norwegian and portrays Grieg with meaning and affection.  He is not a professional singer but his voice suffices as a composer  singing his own songs.The other supporting players add depth to  the story line and the choreography is spectacular.  The sound track, not  available as yet on CD, is beautifully transferred from the film and is a  colector's item in itself.There is a marvelous Christmas sequence  filmed high in a snow-packed retreat and an animated troll number set to  Peer Gynt's Suite that is delightful at any age.What a rare treat  for music lovers. This movie would be a most welcome addition to collectors  and lovers of truly memorable movie musicals--one of the two or three best  in my memory.

The opening scenes when the title and credits are introduced, the photography backed by Grieg&#8217;s Piano Concerto leads you to believe there will be magic coming. Unfortunately the movie doesn&#8217;t stop there. The movie takes you to an unusual place, experientially wise. This movie in some circles could be considered a comedy. The actors and singers are obviously all good (with the exception of the actor who plays Grieg) at what they do and the music of Edvard Grieg is extraordinary.  It is the idea of putting silly lyrics to Griegs music. I could hardly watch the 'trio' singing &#34;Hill of Dreams&#34;. If not for the beautiful fiord sunset cinematography, I would've collapsed with laughter. And yet I love the film as bad as it is. Take the scene when the norwegian folk dancers are dancing behind the wagon carrying Grieg and his girl as they progress along a beautiful fiord singing &#8220;Freddie and his Fiddle&#8221;. The dancers are in folk outfits with a fiddler hopping and twisting in the lead. It is so corny you can't but break a giggle. To watch it makes it hard to keep from falling to the floor laughing. But the child in me loves the beauty of it. It&#8217;s a storybook scene.  If only I would've viewed this as a child I would've given the film three stars! And when the actor who plays Grieg sings I can imagine on first run of the movie people getting up and leaving.

Whoever did this certainly had their own vision and did not follow too many footsteps of other musicals in it's day. I myself, at the time, was a movie soundtrack buff with many movies, not all musicals. Since I have not seen this particular movie in some time, I can say for a fact that the original soundtrack was more of an asset than the movie itself. I agree that the natural scenery was nothing short of awesome, but the storyline involving the movie itself is forgotten. What stuck was the cinemagic and the music. Being I had the original vinyl album release, and still have it, I found the album cover and vinyl soundtrack outrated the movie. Even the cover graphic, complete with piano outline with insets of movie scenes surrounded by blossoming daisies was exhilarting. I think I purchased the soundtrack before I saw the movie. My favorite cuts were ""Strange Music"", ""Three there were"", and ""At Christmastime."" The opening piano intro is totally unforgettable. I think Florence Henderson did a superb job with her long golden hair and wonderful voice.

446131,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,6305074070,the masked reviewer,"[3, 8]","Andrew and Virginia Stone (Julie, Cry Terror) are no ordinary movie realists. In 1960, when they decided to make a movie about the sinking of an ocean liner, (The Last Voyage), they hired the aged Ile de France, hauled her out into the Pacific Ocean, and then effectively scuttled her, in the interests of their art and their commerce. In an industry where big is par, the Stones think colossal.In 1970, their newest project opened at the Cinerama Theater, on a screen almost as wide as the Scandinavian peninsula. SONG OF NORWAY is a film resurrection of the 1944 Broadway operetta about Edvard Grieg, set to the Grieg music as edited and rearranged by Robert Wright and George Forrest, who also wrote those lyrics that Mr. Grieg somehow happened to overlook.A saccharine fantasy with 45 musical numbers, 25 songs, international uvulas, and a production line of fjords, SONG OF NORWAY is no ordinary movie kitsch, but a display to turn Guy Lombardo livid with envy. The film, conceived as a kind of living postcard, is so full of waterfalls, blossoms, lambs, glaciers, folk dancers, mountains, children, suns, and churches, that, it raises kitsch to the status of art. Writer/director Andrew Stone composes every schlocky musical turn by cutting away to landscapes -- so that it becomes a visual ode to the Norwegian soul as defined by the Norwegian Tourist Office. If he sees a summit, you may rest assured that someone is romping up it, a sun is sinking behind it, or an airplane, carrying a camera, is buzzing it, while the movie's six-track stereo system pounds out still another reprise of the piano concerto. It quickly becomes exhausting as people keep breaking into impassioned warbling and frenetic hoofing every few minutes. No location is safe: a hayride, a ferry ride, a snowball fight, and a chase down winding village streets inevitably turn into cause for belting out a tune.And the music is among the worst ever put on a soundtrack. Grieg didn't write show tunes, nor did he ever imagine people would be singing hackneyed versions of his classical compositions while throwing snowballs at each other. With tunes like ""Freddie and His Fiddle,"" ""The Life of a Wife of a Sailor,"" ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" and the appropriately titled ""Strange Music,"" the film simultaneously brings joy to the eyes as the lyrics lay waste to the ears!The cast includes Toralv Maurstad, a blond Norwegian actor too elderly to play the young Grieg, Frank Porretta, a young American singer, as his best friend, and Florence Henderson, who is sometimes photographed through what looks like gauze, as his wife. If you ever paused to ask yourself: ""How come we've never seen any movies starring Florence Henderson?"" Well, the answer to that Zen-worthy riddle can be summarized in just three words: ""Song of Norway."" Yes, she can sing - but whatever charm and pleasantness she could offer for the sale of cooking oil and denture cream was nowhere to be found here.Robert Morley, Edward G. Robinson and Oscar Homolka also appear - mostly as scenic obstructions.SONG OF NORWAY was cruelly attacked by the critics. Pauline Kael's New Yorker barbecue was the most articulate: ""The movie is of an unbelievable badness; it brings back clich&eacute;s you didn't know you knew - they're practically from the unconscious of moviegoers"" Life magazine raved: 'Godawful'. The New Yorker wondered whether it had been made by trolls. The Medved Brothers dubbed Florence Henderson, 'the female Peter Frampton for the Geritol generation'.The film's failure was swift but its leading actors suffered the most: Maurstad never made another American movie, Porretta never made another film, and Florence Henderson was never trusted to appear in a movie until her cameo role in 1992's SHAKES THE CLOWN.But SONG OF NORWAY does have some small rewards -- for critics (who can quote its inane dialogue), and for general audiences (who can feel superior to it).Will there ever be an official dvd release? We can only pray.",5,Oh Where Oh Where Is This Bad Movie Treasure????,1208044800,"04 13, 2008",2008,3997,"['Andrew', 'Virginia', 'Stone', 'Julie', 'Cry', 'Terror', 'are', 'ordinary', 'movie', 'realists', '1960', 'when', 'decided', 'make', 'movie', 'sinking', 'ocean', 'liner', 'Last', 'Voyage', 'hired', 'aged', 'Ile', 'de', 'France', 'hauled', 'out', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'then', 'effectively', 'scuttled', 'interests', 'art', 'commerce', 'industry', 'where', 'big', 'par', 'Stones', 'think', 'colossal.In', '1970', 'newest', 'project', 'opened', 'Cinerama', 'Theater', 'screen', 'almost', 'as', 'wide', 'Scandinavian', 'peninsula', 'SONG', 'NORWAY', 'film', 'resurrection', '1944', 'Broadway', 'operetta', 'Edvard', 'Grieg', 'set', 'Grieg', 'music', 'edited', 'rearranged', 'Robert', 'Wright', 'George', 'Forrest', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'lyrics', 'Mr.', 'Grieg', 'somehow', 'happened', 'overlook.A', 'saccharine', 'fantasy', '45', 'musical', 'numbers', '25', 'songs', 'international', 'uvulas', 'production', 'line', 'fjords', 'SONG', 'OF', 'NORWAY', 'ordinary', 'movie', 'kitsch', 'display', 'turn', 'Guy', 'Lombardo', 'livid', 'envy', 'film', 'conceived', 'kind', 'living', 'postcard', 'so', 'full', 'waterfalls', 'blossoms', 'lambs', 'glaciers', 'folk', 'dancers', 'mountains', 'children', 'suns', 'churches', 'kitsch', 'status', 'art', 'Writer/director', 'Andrew', 'Stone', 'schlocky', 'musical', 'turn', 'cutting', 'away', 'landscapes', 'visual', 'ode', 'Norwegian', 'soul', 'defined', 'Norwegian', 'Tourist', 'Office', 'summit', 'may', 'rest', 'assured', 'someone', 'romping', 'up', 'sun', 'sinking', 'airplane', 'carrying', 'camera', 'buzzing', 'movie', 'six-track', 'stereo', 'system', 'out', 'still', 'reprise', 'piano', 'concerto', 'quickly', 'exhausting', 'people', 'keep', 'breaking', 'impassioned', 'warbling', 'frenetic', 'hoofing', 'few', 'minutes', 'location', 'safe', 'hayride', 'ferry', 'ride', 'snowball', 'fight', 'chase', 'down', 'winding', 'village', 'streets', 'inevitably', 'turn', 'cause', 'belting', 'out', 'tune.And', 'music', 'worst', 'ever', 'put', 'soundtrack', 'Grieg', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'show', 'tunes', 'did', 'ever', 'imagine', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'singing', 'hackneyed', 'versions', 'classical', 'compositions', 'throwing', 'snowballs', 'other', 'tunes', 'Freddie', 'Fiddle', 'Life', 'Wife', 'Sailor', 'Hall', 'Mountain', 'King', 'appropriately', 'titled', 'Strange', 'Music', 'film', 'simultaneously', 'joy', 'eyes', 'lyrics', 'lay', 'waste', 'ears', 'cast', 'Toralv', 'Maurstad', 'blond', 'Norwegian', 'actor', 'too', 'elderly', 'play', 'young', 'Grieg', 'Frank', 'Porretta', 'young', 'American', 'singer', 'best', 'friend', 'Florence', 'Henderson', 'who', 'sometimes', 'photographed', 'what', 'gauze', 'wife', 'ever', 'paused', 'ask', 'How', 'come', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movies', 'starring', 'Florence', 'Henderson', 'Well', 'answer', 'Zen-worthy', 'riddle', 'can', 'be', 'summarized', 'just', 'three', 'words', 'Song', 'Norway', 'Yes', 'can', 'sing', 'charm', 'pleasantness', 'could', 'offer', 'sale', 'cooking', 'oil', 'denture', 'cream', 'was', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'here.Robert', 'Morley', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'Oscar', 'Homolka', 'also', 'appear', 'mostly', 'scenic', 'obstructions.SONG', 'OF', 'NORWAY', 'was', 'cruelly', 'attacked', 'critics', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'New', 'Yorker', 'barbecue', 'was', 'most', 'articulate', 'movie', 'unbelievable', 'badness', 'back', 'clich', 'eacute', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'knew', ""'re"", 'practically', 'unconscious', 'moviegoers', 'Life', 'magazine', 'raved', ""'Godawful"", 'New', 'Yorker', 'wondered', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'trolls', 'Medved', 'Brothers', 'dubbed', 'Florence', 'Henderson', ""'the"", 'female', 'Peter', 'Frampton', 'Geritol', ""generation'.The"", 'film', 'failure', 'was', 'swift', 'leading', 'actors', 'suffered', 'most', 'Maurstad', 'never', 'made', 'American', 'movie', 'Porretta', 'never', 'made', 'film', 'Florence', 'Henderson', 'was', 'never', 'trusted', 'appear', 'movie', 'cameo', 'role', '1992', 'SHAKES', 'THE', 'CLOWN.But', 'SONG', 'OF', 'NORWAY', 'have', 'small', 'rewards', 'critics', 'who', 'can', 'quote', 'inane', 'dialogue', 'general', 'audiences', 'who', 'can', 'feel', 'superior', '.Will', 'ever', 'be', 'official', 'dvd', 'release', 'can', 'only', 'pray']",Song of Norway VHS
