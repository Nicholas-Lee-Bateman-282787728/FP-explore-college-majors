Her step-father has been the businessman who acts like he's running it, so there is the immediate conflict between step-daughter and step-father. Later we learn that there are several reasons for this hostility.Ward Bond plays a crook who is apparently a lawyer, and the local magistrate judge. This at a time when the ""real"" judges were circuit riders who only showed up every few months. He and the aunt of the girl who is supposed to inherit a ranch (another one involved in the crooked land grab) conspire to rob the girl of her inheritance, but Rocklin helps her. There are some mysterious reasons why, and he seems to be attracted to her as well as to Ella Raines, but in fact tells Gabby Hayes he steers clear of women because they are nothing but trouble. The point, I suppose, is that they just won't let him alone.If you don't know that as a standard Wayne ""famous last words"" line, you haven't seen many Wayne westerns. So there are two pretty girls, both drawn to Wayne (who is, after all, young and very macho), and I'm not going to tell you how that comes out and spoil the fun.It's not a bad movie, and Gabby Hayes is pretty funny, but it's just another Wayne Western.",2,Rather Predictable John Wayne Western,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,1412,"['John', 'Wayne', 'Rocklin', 'who', 'town', 'poker', 'game', 'be', 'crooked', 'work', 'ranch', 'out', 'run', 'fiery', 'young', 'woman', 'Ella', 'Raines', 'who', 'inherited', 'when', 'mother', 'died', 'step-father', 'been', 'businessman', 'who', 'running', 'so', 'immediate', 'conflict', 'step-daughter', 'step-father', 'Later', 'learn', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'hostility.Ward', 'Bond', 'crook', 'who', 'apparently', 'lawyer', 'local', 'magistrate', 'judge', 'time', 'when', 'real', 'judges', 'were', 'circuit', 'riders', 'who', 'only', 'showed', 'up', 'few', 'months', 'aunt', 'girl', 'who', 'supposed', 'inherit', 'ranch', 'one', 'involved', 'crooked', 'land', 'grab', 'conspire', 'rob', 'girl', 'inheritance', 'Rocklin', 'are', 'mysterious', 'reasons', 'why', 'be', 'attracted', 'as', 'well', 'Ella', 'Raines', 'fact', 'tells', 'Gabby', 'Hayes', 'clear', 'women', 'are', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'point', 'suppose', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'alone.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'standard', 'Wayne', 'famous', 'last', 'words', 'line', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'Wayne', 'westerns', 'are', 'two', 'pretty', 'girls', 'drawn', 'Wayne', 'who', 'young', 'very', 'macho', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'how', 'out', 'spoil', 'fun.It', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'Gabby', 'Hayes', 'pretty', 'funny', 'just', 'Wayne', 'Western']",N/A

All you have to do is sit back and enjoy.Rocklin (John Wayne) has come to town to work for Red Cardell, only to find he has been murdered. The KC Ranch has been inherited by beautiful easterner Clara Cardell (Audrey Long).  The sweet Clara is attracted to Wayne and wants him to come work for her, but since her mother is an absolute terror and Rocklin and his new found sidekick, freight driver Dave (Gabby Hays), both have a little ""problem"" with women, he passes on her job offer.He gets hired by another prominent outfit, but as it turns out, this one is run by a woman as well. Ella Rains is Arly Harolday, a gorgeous spitfire and cowgirl deluxe. Sparks fly and she falls for Rocklin while he begins to dig a little deeper into the crooked dealings which led to Red Cardell's murder.

Mystery plot comes from actor-writer Paul Fix, comic relief from incomparable Gabby Hayes, while convincing bravado is supplied by you-know-who. Still and all, this is a Gabby Hayes showcase, and I would think a high point of his career (  he had just left the Hopalong series). In fact, the first ten minutes are among the funniest and most satisfying of any Western on record: the chemistry between Hayes and Wayne is simply terrific and easily tops that between Wayne and his two leading ladies. This is a fine &quot;buddy&quot; picture, even if the participants are wildly unequal in age and skills. My one complaint -- special effects and art direction. Scenic shots from Sedona, AR, simply do not blend well with pedestrian shots from the San Fernando Valley, while shoddy process photography and occasional cheapjack sets also  mar final result.

The production values are just adequate even by the standards of 1944 when the film was produced. The story is good but hardly outstanding. But the acting is so compelling this hardly even registers.The DVD itself has only scene selection and a selection of John Wayne film trailers as extras. The main feature itself looks fine.

MarinRocklin (John Wayne) is a chauvinistic cowboy who arrives at the KC Ranch in Santa Inez to apply for a job as a foreman. But when he finds that the owner has died and that the ranch is now being run by two women: Clara Cardell (Audrey Long) and her aunt Miss Martin (Elizabeth Risdon), he hardheadedly refuses to work for them. But later on, Clara comes looking for Rocklin, asking his help in obtaining a letter from the town's corrupt judge Garvey (Ward Bond) that proves that Clara is old enough to be the legal owner of the ranch.Rocklin arrives in Garvey's office just after Garvey has burned the letter. The two tangle, with Rocklin sending Garvey crashing through his door. After the fight, Rocklin meets Arly Harolday (Ella Raines), another female ranch owner. Rocklin's views on women enrage Arly so much that she gets her stepfather (Donald Douglas) to hire him to work on her ranch, just so she can fire him. But in spite of Rocklin's primitive attitudes, Arly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, things are heating up as Garvey and other corrupt officials try to get control of the KC ranch. In order to get rid of Rocklin, a murder rap is pinned on him, forcing him to leave town.A hard-driving cowboy yarn with some memorable scenes.Love the scene where Elisabeth Risdon showing her composure and customary dignity are distinctly ruffled - when she is literally spanked on her bottom by a grizzly 'George 'Gabby' Hayes', two wonderful character actors in an unforgettable scene.Watch for two B-Western sidekicks Raymond Hatton and Gabby Hayes early in the film as the two are drinking -- when Gabby has a blow to his head with a gun barrel.Paul Fix (who also co-wrote the script),There are several western veterans in the supporting cast Hank Bell (with bushy mustache), Paul Fix (pre-Rifleman), Emory Parnell, Eddy Waller (Rocky Lane's sidekick Nugget) and Harry Woods (badman in early 30s).BIOS:1.

With all the westerns I saw growing up in the 1950s, I don't recall ever seeing this one until a decade ago on TNT's ole 4:00 p.m. daily westerns. I immediately went out and bought the VHS and viewed it many times over. As soon as my wife and I got home with the DVD a few days back we immediately viewed it, too. She is not much for westerns, but her comment after viewing TALL IN THE SADDLE for the first time was that it was a very good movie.I'm partial to some of the earlier John Wayne movies before he became a 'household name', one in particular: BLUE STEEL. And I rate this movie, TALL IN THE SADDLE, just as good. I would give both BLUE STEEL and TALL IN THE SADDLE more than 5-stars if possible.TALL IN THE SADDLE was made at a time when directors and actors knew how to make westerns, and this movie just has the feel of a very good one. Its excellence approaches STAGECOACH, an earlier John Wayne movie, that just barely surpasses both BLUE STEEL and TALL IN THE SADDLE.So, if you like John Wayne westerns or just westerns in general, you can do no better than this one.And George ""Gabby"" Hayes is at his best here, too. This is the first time I ever saw Ella Raines in a movie, and what an introduction to her. She is sensational as a gun-totin' woman of the range.Another item not to go unnoticed in this flick is the appearance of Raymond Hatton in the role a drunken friend of Gabby Hayes. If you look up Raymond Hatton you will see that he made more westerns than any other actor, and at one time was a box office draw right along side Bob Steele and Hoot Gibson. Another outstanding item in this movie is that of Paul Fix, long a John Wayne friend; Fix wrote the screen play for TALL IN THE SADDLE, and anyone familiar with the 1950s Rifleman on TV will certainly remember Mr. Paul Fix.Enough of all this, go watch this sensational western picture from long ago, when they still knew how to make them.Semper Fi.",5,"""A Fast-Paced Entertaining Western""",1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,2128,"['DVD', 'shelf', 'sagging', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'when', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'had', 'add', 'others.When', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'was', 'going', '1', 'year', 'age', 'westerns', 'saw', 'growing', 'up', '1950s', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'seeing', 'one', 'decade', 'ago', 'TNT', 'ole', '4:00', 'p.m.', 'daily', 'westerns', 'immediately', 'went', 'bought', 'VHS', 'viewed', 'many', 'times', 'over', 'As', 'soon', 'wife', 'got', 'home', 'DVD', 'few', 'days', 'back', 'immediately', 'viewed', 'too', 'not', 'much', 'westerns', 'comment', 'viewing', 'TALL', 'IN', 'THE', 'SADDLE', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'partial', 'earlier', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'became', ""'household"", 'name', 'one', 'particular', 'BLUE', 'STEEL', 'rate', 'movie', 'TALL', 'IN', 'THE', 'SADDLE', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'would', 'give', 'BLUE', 'STEEL', 'TALL', 'IN', 'THE', 'SADDLE', 'more', '5-stars', 'possible.TALL', 'IN', 'THE', 'SADDLE', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'when', 'directors', 'actors', 'knew', 'how', 'make', 'westerns', 'movie', 'just', 'feel', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'excellence', 'approaches', 'STAGECOACH', 'earlier', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'just', 'barely', 'BLUE', 'STEEL', 'TALL', 'IN', 'THE', 'SADDLE.So', 'like', 'John', 'Wayne', 'just', 'westerns', 'general', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'one.And', 'George', 'Gabby', 'Hayes', 'best', 'here', 'too', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'Ella', 'Raines', 'movie', 'what', 'introduction', 'sensational', 'gun-totin', 'woman', 'range.Another', 'item', 'not', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'flick', 'appearance', 'Raymond', 'Hatton', 'role', 'drunken', 'friend', 'Gabby', 'Hayes', 'look', 'up', 'Raymond', 'Hatton', 'will', 'see', 'made', 'more', 'westerns', 'other', 'actor', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'draw', 'right', 'side', 'Bob', 'Steele', 'Hoot', 'Gibson', 'outstanding', 'item', 'movie', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'long', 'John', 'Wayne', 'friend', 'Fix', 'wrote', 'screen', 'play', 'TALL', 'IN', 'THE', 'SADDLE', 'anyone', 'familiar', '1950s', 'Rifleman', 'TV', 'will', 'certainly', 'remember', 'Mr.', 'Paul', 'Fix.Enough', 'go', 'watch', 'sensational', 'western', 'picture', 'long', 'ago', 'when', 'still', 'knew', 'how', 'make', 'them.Semper', 'Fi']",N/A

31191,A1DZSBTVCJ883,0780622278,W. Walker,"[6, 6]","One of my favorite westerns. I own a copy. The plot is complex enough to be worthy of Cecil DeMille, though directed by Edwin Marin. Some have categorized this as a glorified ""B"" western, but I see nothing ""B"" about the cast of main characters nor the story line. Of course, we soon figure out that Wayne and Ella Raines' character were made for each other, but the ""right"" woman doesn't quite always end up with the hero, as for example in ""The Far Country"". We are kept in suspense through most of the film as to who killed Red Cardell and why, and who has been trying to ambush Wayne and why. We also wonder what Wayne's real motive is for sticking around after discovering that Red Cardell, whom he presumably never met, is deceased. It's always a treat to have Gabby Hayes back in a Wayne western. Ward Bond, another fixture in Wayne movies of the 1940s and 1950s, does well as a prime suspect for being responsible for the plot shenanigans and in  piecing things together at the end. Audrey Long is perfect as the prim naive beauty from the East, as is Elizabeth Risdon, as her scheming arrogant old battle-ax of an aunt. Wouldn't the latter and Gabby make a lovely couple! Ella's character may have been a more exciting lover and companion than Audrey's; but, if I were Wayne, I'd be extremely careful about getting into a relationship with such a hot-headed jealous tomboy who thinks nothing of using me for target practice with her pistol and knife! There are a few seemingly incongruous  details to the plot. Why does Ella's bodyguard hold off telling who killed Ella's brother? Does he want Wayne to take the blame? Jealous? Maybe he doesn't think anyone would believe him or doesn't believe the legal system will do justice. Or, perhaps he did tell the real reason to Ella. As is true of westerns in general, vigilante justice  seems to be condoned by the main characters as the most just and efficient way to rid societies of evil people or those who have done you personally wrong....As a side note, this film should not be confused with the later Clark Gable western with the somewhat similar title ""The Tall Men""",5,"not a ""B"" western",1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,2128,"['One', 'favorite', 'westerns', 'own', 'copy', 'plot', 'complex', 'enough', 'be', 'worthy', 'Cecil', 'DeMille', 'though', 'directed', 'Edwin', 'Marin', 'have', 'categorized', 'glorified', 'B', 'western', 'see', 'nothing', 'B', 'cast', 'main', 'characters', 'story', 'line', 'course', 'soon', 'figure', 'out', 'Wayne', 'Ella', 'Raines', 'character', 'were', 'made', 'other', 'right', 'woman', ""n't"", 'quite', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'hero', 'example', 'Far', 'Country', 'are', 'kept', 'suspense', 'most', 'film', 'who', 'killed', 'Red', 'Cardell', 'why', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'ambush', 'Wayne', 'why', 'also', 'wonder', 'what', 'Wayne', 'real', 'motive', 'sticking', 'around', 'discovering', 'Red', 'Cardell', 'whom', 'presumably', 'never', 'met', 'deceased', 'always', 'treat', 'have', 'Gabby', 'Hayes', 'back', 'Wayne', 'western', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'fixture', 'Wayne', 'movies', '1940s', '1950s', 'well', 'prime', 'suspect', 'being', 'responsible', 'plot', 'shenanigans', 'piecing', 'things', 'together', 'end', 'Audrey', 'Long', 'perfect', 'prim', 'naive', 'beauty', 'East', 'Elizabeth', 'Risdon', 'scheming', 'arrogant', 'old', 'battle-ax', 'aunt', 'Would', ""n't"", 'latter', 'Gabby', 'make', 'lovely', 'couple', 'Ella', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'exciting', 'lover', 'companion', 'Audrey', 'were', 'Wayne', ""'d"", 'be', 'extremely', 'careful', 'getting', 'relationship', 'hot-headed', 'jealous', 'tomboy', 'who', 'nothing', 'using', 'target', 'practice', 'pistol', 'knife', 'are', 'few', 'seemingly', 'incongruous', 'details', 'plot', 'Why', 'Ella', 'bodyguard', 'hold', 'off', 'telling', 'who', 'killed', 'Ella', 'brother', 'want', 'Wayne', 'take', 'blame', 'Jealous', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'believe', ""n't"", 'believe', 'legal', 'system', 'will', 'do', 'justice', 'perhaps', 'did', 'tell', 'real', 'reason', 'Ella', 'As', 'true', 'westerns', 'general', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'be', 'condoned', 'main', 'characters', 'most', 'just', 'efficient', 'way', 'rid', 'societies', 'evil', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'personally', 'wrong', 'side', 'note', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'later', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'western', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'title', 'Tall', 'Men']",N/A
