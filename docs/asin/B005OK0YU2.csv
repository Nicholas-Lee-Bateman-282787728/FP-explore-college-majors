EL ended up being fifteen bucks. I actually didn't even want this title, but I couldn't let this deal pass me by.I saw episode one once on the anime network & don't recall anything except that the beginning contained an ultra violent scene with blood everywhere and I just didn't care enough to be interested. I've brought many anime titles in the past few months & non have the x-factor to keep interested or hooked in the way Sailor Moon does.I couldn't sleep last night and all i wanted to do was watch some anime before i finally got tired enough to go back to sleep. So i decided to finally give this series a second chance. I unwrapped this set since it was gathering dust on my DVD shelf, popped it in and from the immediate opening song i felt i was in for a good show. I've noticed that most series that have awesome opening songs tend to be good shows. Elfen Lied was no exception. To my surprise, i was hooked from the first episode and was doing my best to cram in as many episodes as possible before 3AM.This is a great series and is only thirteen episodes. I'll provide a quick recap since everyone has already gone into full details in their reviews. The story is about a girl named Nyu/Lucy who escapes from some facility where she was held captive & under lock down. She has extraordinary powers and in one last attempt to capture her, a shot was taken to her helmet which skewed her memory somehow and has created a temporary memory loss or dual personality. Nyu/Lucy wakes up on the beach the next day completely unaware of what happened the night before. She meets 2 people on her journey to finding out what's going on. The show does have a sheer amount of violence, but at the same time balances the comedy, and light hearted areas really well. It wasn't non-stop violence. There were actually many moments of intimate friendship.Anyways, this is a great series and ranks up there with some of the best anime titles in film history. Buy it and you will enjoy it. The price tag is a bit over the top on AMZ but it does occasionally go on sale so pick it up. But for thirteen episodes, try not to get this item at full price. I'll be spending the day copying the DVD onto my iPod Touch, so i can enjoy this on the way to work. I'm in shock i enjoyed this so much because it is an addictive series and i really liked that this wasn't as dull as all the other titles I've been watching recently.

1496414,A3474ZR07UN1CJ,B005OK0YU2,"DL ""never slacking in pace, only lacking mist...","[17, 19]","I had heard so many things about Elfen Lied.  Mostly how it was so violent, brutal and horrific.  I finally watched it and I'm kinda blown away.  I'm left with a mixture of feelings.  So many brutal moments, so many sad moments, so many nice moments.  And the ending is also a mix of happy and tragic.  I guess what I'm so impressed with is how everything fits together in this story.  Its actually a pretty complex story for only 13 episodes.  But as the series goes on, everything comes together and fits together like pieces of a puzzle.  It seems like it was a really well thought out story!  Different events happen during the course of the show, which may seem unrelated, but in the end you see how everything is interconnected.  The 1-star review trashed this show and said it was a combination of every cliche in anime.  Well, I cannot speak to its 100% originality or any ground-breaking new concepts, as I am not that experienced or vexed of an anime viewer.  All I can tell you is that in my opinion, this is an amazing show.  If you dont feel touched emotionally at some point while watching, then something has got to be wrong with you.  There are horrendous and heart-wrenching parts, but there are also heartfelt scenes about loving, caring, values of family and friedship.  If themes like this have become too cliche for you then you might as well pass on Elfen Lied, as you have probably watched too much anime for your own good anyway.  I think its amazing how they managed to combine so many different aspects together in 1 show, and it does NOT seem forced in my opinion.  I was afraid this show was going to be too dark and depressing.  But there is enough happiness to balance out the dark, and somehow through all the horror it manages to have a satisfying ending.

1496415,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,B005OK0YU2,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[30, 95]","If you're familiar with me and my reviews, chances are you know darn well that I loathe Elfen Lied more than anything on this planet, scratch that, this whole universe.  However, since this extremely fellated animated series is being re-released (I don't know why) and since this is being showered with unanimous praise, it's time to bring some sense to the party.I saw Elfen Lied last May, thinking it would be a masterpiece, but what I got was an anime so awful, I was nearly turned off the entire genre because of it.  Fortunately, AD Police and the works of Satoshi Kon roped me back in.  What disgusts me more than Elfen Lied are the legions of imbeciles that are fellating this dreck to death because after you read my review, you'll know that these people aren't really bright.Lots of people will tell you this is a masterpiece in anime but they're DEAD WRONG.  I'm not focusing on the well known over abundance of violence and nudity, I'm focusing on how everything is contrived beyond the point of there being any shred of plausibility or coherency.  I will provide examples as of why.CHARACTERS:The characters have no semblance to reality whatsoever.  Aside from the fact that Kohta and Yuka take in a naked mentally ill girl without telling anyone, there's other examples of this problem.  Why is it that when Kohta finds out that Lucy killed his little sister and dad, he doesn't show any resentment towards Lucy?  I'm not expecting Kohta to go all ""Rambo"" on Lucy (thought that could have been a little satisfying), but wouldn't be a little more realistic if he at least verbally blasted her in a relatively passionate manner?  Also, why is it that Mayu doesn't become a severe pessimist after being molested by her stepdad and having to live off her pet dog's food?  The characters aren't deep, either; they're all shallow stereotypes.  Kohta is the clich&eacute; mousy male character who finds himself surrounded by women, Yuka and Lucy/Nuy are among the several women feuding each other for Kohta's attention, and Lucy has a split personality; when haven't we seen this stuff before?  The more snob-ish type of EL fan will over analyze this clich&eacute; and try to justify its existence by comparing it to the concepts of C.G. Jung or Freud in an attempt to make this look deeper than it really is, but it's nothing more than ripping off Tenchi Muyo or Love Hina.  Lucy's backstory about how she became a naked meatgrinder isn't the least bit impressive.  Oh look, she was bullied as a kid and they even killed her dog, how sad!!  Didn't every nu-metal band in existence abuse the whole ""I'm a victim, I hate the world!!"" theme to death in their faux-aggressive music?  Another thing is that we're supposed to see Nana as some sort of tragic figure since she's constantly getting torn up and pummeled but I think it's just her fault since she's so unbelievably passive.CARELESS MIXING OF GENRES:Elfen Lied carelessly mixes genres of anime and while the legions of shallow people hailing this as the greatest thing ever see that as original, rational people like myself are absolutely disgusted by it.  Look, certain genres don't go together.  Seeing cheap pornographic grindhouse action in one moment and seeing sappy harem comedy the next just doesn't work.PLOT-HOLES, CONTRADICTING THEMES, BAD ENDING, AND BAD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:Right from the beginning, Elfen Lied is asking you to leave your brain at the door prior to watching it.  Lucy escapes the research facility as is knocked unconscious by a sniper's bullet striking her helmet and forcing her to fall into the ocean.  Aside from not dying on impact from the water (she fell hundreds of feet), how does she not break any bones and not drown?  She's unconscious, she can't swim, so how does she survive being in the water?!!  Apparently, EL's theme is that humanity is monstrous to beings it sees as ""inhuman,"" which is supposed to explain the scientists torturing and killing the Dicloniuses.  I wouldn't have a problem with that if the message didn't contradict itself.  The Diconiuses kill people on instinct and the head of the company doing these experiments, who turns out to be a Diclonius, WANTS them to kill of humanity.  Also, the fact that this guy is a Diclonius doesn't make sense since he's in charge of this company and therefore in charge of the torturing and killing of his own species.  If I cared about anyone in EL (I don't), I'd want to see the Diclonius race get napalmed because the writers screwed up their ""message"" that badly.  EL leaves a lot of things unexplained since it not only reveals that the company head is a Diclonius towards the end, nothing is fleshed out about that afterwards.  It also has the worst ending I've ever seen in film since NOTHING is explained.  I don't mind ""spoiling"" it for those who haven't seen this abomination since it leaves you thinking that Lucy MIGHT have been killed (of course, they take the pretentious route by not showing it to leave you guessing) but Kohta comes to open the front gate of his house with a shadow on it and once he reaches for the handle, it ends.  WORST ENDING EVER.  We're introduced to Lucy as seeing her as a beast, but they later change her a little to make her sympathetic to audiences.  Apparently, seeing Lucy as Nyu is supposed to make me like her, they failed miserably.  All Nyu does is shamble around naked and say ""Nyu"" as she breaks things, this is supposed to make me overlook her insatiable blood thirst?!!  It's like they can't decide if they want me to see Lucy as a monster or an infantile bimbo; either way, she's an abhorent character.  There's a lot of ""deus ex machina"" moments that really kill off any plausibility this might have had like when Bando and his comrade corner Nyu and RIGHT before they kill her, she turns to Lucy and attacks.  The writers for Elfen Lied were either a bunch of monkeys with Microsoft Word or a bunch of lobotomized people that are equivalent to said monkeys.APPEARANCE:I hate the way everything looks in Elfen Lied, especially the character designs.  Since EL is extremely violent and pornographic, the fact that the characters look like they were plucked right out of Love Hina or Chobits (they have a ""cute"" look) will make any rational person grasp their skulls with both hands and groan continuously out of anger.  In and of themselves, the overbearing saccharine appearance of those girls with their freakishly big eyes makes me want to vomit my guts out.  Mixing ""cute"" with gratuitous violence and nudity is like using battery acid as a condiment for the Classic Italian sandwich at Quiznos.  Yeah, it's different, but it doesn't mean it's good.  The animation and artwork looks like it was made with digital imaging and animation programs, giving it a really stale look (like all other anime nowadays).  So not even the artwork and animation has any charm to it.  I really hate the Diclonius designs since they're basically the stereotypical ""catgirl"" thing infesting anime nowadays.VIOLENCE, NUDITY, AND INCEST:None of the above things offend me whatsoever since I'm not a stranger to either.  However, these things look like they were shoved in EL to attract fickle anime fans (which it unfortunately has) and to offend anyone who is a ""prude.""  These also aren't really that offensive taken by themselves since they're used so numerously that they no longer have any provocative value to them after about 20 minutes of exposure.  For those of you who are claiming that the constant use of these three things is somehow ""extreme,"" go watch Doomed Megalopolis for an excellent horror anime that utilized violence, nudity, and incest to make the overall experience unnerving rather than tedious.SOUNDTRACK:It's time to focus on the most overrated anime song ever, ""Lilium.""  Everyone thinks this is such a strong and emotional song, but it's a joke.  From an initial listen, you may think it's really emotional an whatnot, but when you see that it's grouped with extremely sugary-looking anime characters, Love Hina dramedy plot, and one of the most saccharine J-pop songs ever put in anime, it comes off as trying too hard.  The soundtracks in Ghost in the Shell and Grave of the Fireflies have much better (and much more consistent) music with an emotional punch.SYMBOLISM:When symbolism is incorporated into a movie or series properly, it enhances the viewing experience.  With EL, however, the symbolism is carelessly thrown in to make it look ""deep"" and ""intellectual.""  For one, the clock symbol in EL didn't do anything to make this any better.  ""Oh look, the broken clock represents Kohta's broken past and at the end it's fixed, and so is he!!  How genius!!""  Give me a break.  While not really symbolism, I find the use of German names in the series's name and of the names of the episodes to be loathsomely pretentious, and I don't care that this is named after a German poem.ABUSE OF GUSTAV KLIMT'S ARTWORK:The use of Gustav Klimt's paintings on the opening credits is more examples of self-awarding pretentiousness since Klimt's artwork is splendid and when saccharine-looking anime girls are thrown into his paintings, it's a severe clash in artistic styles and looks unbelievably stupid.  Klimt is rolling in his grave because of this anime.  While the more snobby Elfen Sheep will automatically praise this move on behalf of the anime simply for referencing a 20th century painter, it's just one of the many, many fronts used to cover up the ultimate lack of coherent plot structure, lack of interesting characters, lacking a consistent message, and lack of an ending that ties up at least some of the loose ends.  You know, the qualities that really matter when making any sort of show or movie.  Contrary to what the Elfen Lied fans convince themselves to think, making vague to non-existent references to Gustav Klimt and of some psychologists doesn't yield a masterpiece.  You need those basic principles I mentioned above because those are universal in making any movie or TV show worthwhile.  Without those, you can vaguely reference Gustav Klimt and old German poems all you want and it won't change the fact that the final product is a horribly, horribly jumbled mess.  This is like trying to make a giant pile of elephant excrement appetizing by covering it with butter cream frosting, sprinkles, and candles then selling it to an unsuspecting customer as a birthday cake; only in that case, people would immediately spit the ""cake"" out, but the people who love Elfen Lied continue to happily eat the ""cake"" because they refuse to see the truth.SUMMARY:Elfen Lied can be seen in several abhorrent ways.  It can be seen as an anime that wants to have its cake and eat it too.  It wants to be seen as ""deep"" and ""smart"" but at the same time wants to appeal to a bunch of hair-brained anime fans who can't get enough of harem comedy anime.  It also somehow achieved the impossible by appealing to every anime-interested demographic out there, which wouldn't happen in a rational-thinking world.  It's like the writers said to their staff ""Hey, let's make an anime that absolutely loathsome but will include every anime clich&eacute; and fetish that will draw in the furries, perverts, action fans, slasher fans, and harem fans!!  This will catch like wildfire!!""  Sadly, it has done just that.  I can't find any newer anime fan who hasn't heard of this abomination.  Lynn Okamoto (original author) and Mamoru Kanbe (made the anime) are some of the worst scum on the planet for making Elfen Lied.  They come off as horribly, horribly self-indulgent people who roll around in their own filth and because they think they created something ""unique"" and ""deep,"" they're immune to any sort of criticism.  They aren't immune to criticism and the more they receive, the better.FINAL WORD:For those who haven't seen it and will heed my advice and those who previously liked it and had ""second thoughts"" after reading my review, kudos to you; it shows that people can still think properly.  If you want to see an anime that'll really tug at your heartstrings, go watch Grave of the Fireflies; that anime will move the toughest cynic to tears.  I'll stick to MUCH, MUCH superior anime like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Armitage III (OVA), Paprika, Perfect Blue, Neo Tokyo, Memories, Doomed Megalopolis, and AD Police (original OVA) for adult anime that actually functions properly.  Finally, if I get a terminal disease, I'll spend my remaining days on Earth finding Lynn Okamoto and Mamoru Kanbe and horribly quelling their lives with a variety of heavy mining equipment and heavy duty power tools which would make the fate of DJ in Event Horizon look like child's play in comparison.If you don't like my review, feel free to vent your anger, just don't expect me to read what you have to say because it's more fun to starve trolls than to feed them.",1,Offensive to every sensibility imaginable.  0%,1245369600,"06 19, 2009",2009,12890,"[""'re"", 'familiar', 'reviews', 'chances',

Sibley,"[2, 5]","While I have yet to start watching this series I have seen some of it, and it is a good series (adults only, not meant for children especially under the age of 15). However I am annoyed with this packaging. Rather then it having a middle flap and whatnot, and each disc going in its own separate holder- they just stack all three discs on top of one another. I assume this is the legit copy as it was ordered for me through amazon for Christmas. It is very disappointing to realize that the S.A.V.E packs of anime have MUCH better packaging, safer too for the discs, then this overpriced pack. While it does have the whole series on three discs, it's simply horribly packaged. Especially with an over-sized case like this, where there is a sheet of foam on the right hand side. Hint- if you need foam on one side of the case to prevent damage, you need to use a different design on it. Also, there was no information packet or anything in it. Just discs and foam. For the price asked... I just don't know. If I can I'm going to buy jewel cases for the dvds, as I am seriously worried that they will become damaged in this flawed package. While I am stressing this, this is a GOOD SERIES! I am not saying that it isn't, just that for the price paid this needs to come in a safer package for the DVDs.

When it comes to this anime series, this one has it all. There were very little things that I did'nt like in this series. I will tell you a little about the story line in the next paragraph.It starts out with Lucy who is a mutant( She has invisible arms that can kill people and horn like bones sticking out of her head) escaping the facility that had trapped and kept her for experiments. Then the story shoots over to the other main character Kouta. He just got off the train and is heading to his new home that his relatives are letting him use while he is in college. On the way there him and his cousin pick up Lucy(who cant remember anything at all) and has developed a language problem. Eventually they go through all sorts of trouble trying to keep Lucy a secret and try to figure out where she came from. She sometimes returns to her normal self though, but only for short periods of time. The crazy part is that Kouta has memory loss as well and him and Lucy met in the past. I really can't tell you anymore.This series takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. You will experience emotions like love(indirectly if that makes sense), hate, happiness and sorrow. I would have easily have paid ten times more for this series if I had to. This is one of the best series I have seen(I have viewed around fifty) and has one of the best sound tracks as well. The characters in this series are great and even the characters with the smallest roller play a major part.

1496424,A3F9VH8916IA40,B005OK0YU2,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[12, 24]","No, cousin, I don't want to fondle your breast.That pretty much sums up my feelings for this show right there. Elfen Lied, despite what so many sappy, shallow people would tell you, is nowhere NEAR a masterpiece; I wouldn't even go so far as to call it good. It is, for all intents and purposes, a woefully inadequate attempt at a drama which falls far short of tragedy greats in anime such as Grave of the Fireflies (2-Disc Collector's Edition), Kino's Journey - The Complete Collection, Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set), and yes Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collection. It is an ant amongst giants. Fans of the series will point to the many instances of drama and ""tear jerking moments"" as proof that there is substance of any kind to be found here, but they would be wrong. Instead of coming off as depressing, the more appalling moments in this show come across as more disgusting than anything else. Whereas moments in shows like ""Now and Then, Here and There"" and EVA showed tragedy in ways which were designed to not only depress its viewers but also leave them with ""heartbreaking fondness;"" Elfen Lied simply wants to gross you out as much as humanly possible.Just about every moment of this show is saturated with fan service almost to the point, no, take that back, TO the point of absurdity. Some fan service here and there is okay, I don't really like it but its fine, but THIS MUCH!? How many times do I have to see Lucy (or Nyu, which is her alter ego) shamble around on screen wearing nothing but socks? How many times must I have to see Mayu (who's 13 BTW) take a bath with Nanna (who is also 13)? Nothing makes you feel like a pervert more than watching a couple 13 year olds take a bath together for ten minutes. Am I supposed to watch or should I look away?The show starts off with a ten minute bloodbath as a naked Lucy strolls though the hulls of a heavenly protected government research lab killing literally hundreds of well armed soldiers and guards (and one very unfortunate, very clumsy secretary). She manages to escape but is shot in the head, which then causes her to lose her memory. Washing up on a nearby beach the next morning (naked, as always) she is taken in by a pair of well meaning college students (who only go to class once during the series; I guess class attendance isn't really a top priority in Japan), Kohta and Yuka. Now let's play a little game; you see a naked, clearly mentally ill girl wash up on the beach without the ability to speak. Do you...A) Call the police.B) Give her some food and cloths and THEN call the police. Or would you...C) Take said naked girl home with you and NOT tell anyone.If you said A or B then TADA! You're a normal person. If you said C then you are a character in Elfen Lied. YEAH! I know anime isn't a genre where characters always act and talk like real people, but COME ON! Who wouldn't call the police if they found a naked mentally ill girl on the beach? (Other than perverts, that is). Is it too much to expect these characters to act at least somewhat realistically?And that's pretty much the problem with this show from beginning to end; the characters don't act like real people. The love triangle that's started up between Nyu (Lucy), Kohta, and Yuka, I guess to add a second layer of ""depth"" to the story (you know, give it something other than the whole naked girls killing lots and lots of people) comes off as more of a soap opera than anything else. What person actually asks their first cousin to fondle their breast? YUCK! Every time Kohta does anything with another girl (oftentimes just helping them out) Yuka gets jealous, calls him a jerk, maybe slaps him around, and then runs off crying. Now I can sympathize to a point, but girl GET OVER YOURSELF! It isn't the end of the world if your first cousin isn't romantically interested in you.But it isn't only that, characters who really are likable and DO have interesting back stories (Mayu for instance) are introduced, and then almost ignored. Mayu had possibly one of the saddest back stories in the whole show, and yet her past was never fleshed out or used to propel the story. I would have loved to see her run into her step father in the streets someday, or maybe she, with the help of her friends, could have tried to confront him. Although the creators of this show get props for attempting such an ambitious story, they get no credit for execution as the whole thing is more disgusting then sad and is not elaborated on during the course of the series. Mayu serves as a plot device for the rest of the series, and it is very unfortunate for the series as a whole because instead they decide to focus on Khota and Yuka who are, quite frankly, uninteresting and boring.So now for some good stuff. The little Diclonius (the race of horned mutants of which Lucy [or Nye], and Nanna are a part) girls are SO adorable that it was almost impossible to find any fault in them, even when they went on bloody rampages and killed dozens of innocent people. All they had to do was look at the screen with those giant red eyes of theirs and cry a little bit and my heart would break for them. Who knew such sadistic killers could be so cute? Despite my trashing the linier story of this show, the back story for Lucy was actually quite stunning (if a little too convenient). The part with her dog was SO depressing I was tempted to give this show more than two stars, but alas the ending didn't give it any hope of such a high rating. My favorite part, by far, is when Lucy goes to the zoo as a child and is amazed by the size of the elephants and giraffes.""Oh, it's so big, how did it get so big?"" (that's what she said) Elephant trumpet ""whow, amazing!"" (Just imagine this in the cutest little girl voice possible).It reminded me so much of my own childhood, going to the Omaha Zoo (one of the biggest in the country BTW) and begging my parents to let me see the elephants because they were my favorite.Yes, I'm a sucker when it comes to little girls suffering; probably explains why my favorite shows are ""Now and Then, Here and There"" and ""Gunslinger Girl"", and if Elfen Lied had focused on this back story instead of the inane love triangle/government conspiracy nonsense it could have very well been a masterpiece. As is, with only a few episodes dedicated to back story, the show could not stand the weight of its own self importance. Nanna was also a pretty interesting character, though at the very end of the show she did get a bit annoying.The animation for this show was actually quite good; better in fact then most anime I've seen. The backgrounds were quite stunning in their detail and the character designs were oh so cute. The music was pretty plain, although the main theme wasn't bad at all, if a little less impressive then other shows. It's the opening and ending that get on my nerves. More naked girls shuffling around while the camera zooms in on their breast. Don't believe me? It's true. The ending is some Japanese rock song with a still picture of a naked Lucy while the camera slowly zoom in on her left breast. What kind of person does it take to watch that all the way through? I wonder... maybe the same kind of person it takes to give this show a five star review.So if you're looking for tragedy, look elsewhere at the shows I've already mentioned. Elfen Lied is nothing special, that is unless you're looking for underage girls taking baths together, in which case I'd suggest you turn yourself in to your local authorities and get immediate psychiatric help.

1496426,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B005OK0YU2,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[6, 8]","This is the story of Lucy. She is a mutant with horns and special powers. There are others like her, but Lucy is believed to be the original. She is shot in the head while escaping the facility where she is being studied. She washes ashore after her escape and is found by Kohta, a college student. Lucy has lost her memory after the accident so Kohta tries to look after her. The military starts sending other mutants after her. The battles cause her to revert back to her old violent and cold self. She also remembers that she has a past connection to Kohta from childhood. She begins questioning the love he has given her and the love she has begun to feel for him.This anime is way cool. It has some great characters and a good story. There is a lot of brutal violence and nudity. In my opinion the violence and nudity go too far. Violence doesn't bother me, but there is too much stuff that I would call torture porn. If these things bother you, you should probably not watch Elfen Lied. I just don't let it bother me, it's only make believe after all. It's not worth getting bent out of shape about. I like this anime. The story is character driven, and the characters are very good. They mixed the violence and love in this story very carefully. It is brilliantly written. The animation and voice acting are very good. The soundtrack isn't all that memorable, but it's not bad by any stretch of the imagination. If you can handle people getting cut open and having their limbs torn asunder, then you will really enjoy this anime. People consider Schindler's List a masterpiece, and it goes way too far. This is no different.To sum it up.

1496427,A2ZW8FZTH5U1BE,B005OK0YU2,K. F.,"[3, 5]","Elfen Lied has its fair share of gratuitous nudity.Elfen Lied contains lots of gratuitous violence.Elfen Lied has one of the most gripping, emotional storylines I've ever experienced in any medium. I love this series.I think this is one of those things that is best to just watch without knowing anything about it before hand. I had no idea what the hell it was about before my friend brought it over, indicating only that it was ""disturbing"" and he'd only seen the first few episodes but he thought it might be all right to watch it togther. Because I knew nothing about it, I was surprised every step of the way - I think that is a crucial part of truly experiencing a story that is nearly lost in our age of overly detailed plot summaries, dust jackets, and reviews that don't seem to pay any respect to the route the author intended you to take. However, if you prefer knowing most of the details beforehand, you can look at the other reviews as well.But anyway, without being too specific, the violence and nudity are integral to the story, accentuating themes of anger and tragedy against youth and innocence, and playing a huge role in character development. Yes, some of it is just for the sake of violence and nudity, but again they're part of the core of the story and it wouldn't have the same impact or depth without them. The nudity gets fanservicey but it's also to be a relief between the darker elements of the story.

1496436,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B005OK0YU2,Scrimshaw,"[0, 2]","Elfen Lied is a 13 episode anime series based off the seinen manga of the same name by Lynn Okamoto (who's a guy by the way, despite the first name). It deals with various dark and tragic themes such as Love, Hatred, Regret, Innocence, Forgiveness, and the duality of human nature. It follows the main protagonist, Lucy, who is the ""queen"" of a mutant offshoot of humanity known as Diclonius, who are only distinguishable from ordinary humans by two cat-ear like horns on their head and invisible arms known as ""vectors"" which have the ability to slice through objects at lightning fast speed, and yes that includes human flesh. These vectors also have the ability to infect ordinary humans with the Diclonius virus, so that their children are born as Diclonius instead of ordinary humans. It deals with the interactions between these two races and the prejudice and animosity that exists between them due mostly to the fact that Diclonius have ""horns"" and human do not. It seems rather silly on the surface, but as you delve deeper into the prejudice that results from such small differences, such as skin tone, it makes far more sense. All in all, Elfen Lied is a mixed bag, on the one hand the animation, sound quality, and music is all very detailed and beautiful most of the time, really giving the series a very deep and hauntingly beautiful feel to it. The blend of dark and light elements is also quite good, as the series jumps between scenes of dark horror, sadness, and tragedy, to scenes of wacky comedy hi-jinks and ultra moe cuteness, mostly revolving around the split personality of Lucy, the innocent, childlike Nyu. It all blends quite nicely. However, there are also many negatives to this series, most notably the endless slew of blood, gore, and nudity, which all feels incredibly forced and unnecessary. In addition to this, the cruelty and malice of many characters, both human and diclonius, feels incredibly forced and unnatural, most notably a certain scene involving a lost dog and it's owner.In addition to this, the voice acting in the English version is decent at best, some characters, most notably Bando, Lucy, Nana, and Yuka are pretty good, but others like Kouta, Kurama, Mayu, and Kanae definitely could have been better. Last but not least, the entire anime series length, as well as the ending, could have been much better. In order to finish the series you have to read the manga which the anime is based off of, and it is quite clear by the ambiguous ending of the anime that it wasn't the same ending of the manga. There are still many mysteries untold and unexplained by the end of the anime series, and because of this, perhaps above all else, that ruined the overall score of the series for me. Elfen Lied had the potential to be great, but it only turned out good in the end. Quite a shame really.Now, as for the plot and characters themselves, the basic plot focuses on two teenage college students, Kouta and Yuka finding a naked horned girl on the beach after said naked girl brutally murders and decapitates hordes of armed soldiers in the first scene of the first episode, she is now far more innocent and harmless and can only say Nyu, so they take her home (without bothering to contact the police), and name her Nyu. However, her murderous, sadistic personality is not gone, and it emerges time and time again over the course of the series during the repeated attempts by the staff and scientists of the facility that contained her, to first capture and then kill her. Meanwhile, Kouta as well as Lucy, seem to share a strange mysterious bond that is left supposedly unknown until the last episodes of the series, but any well educated viewer will guess the ""bond"" they share, long before the big reveal occurs. It is these elements as well as numerous flashbacks that add a very psychological element to this series that is quite mysterious and frightening, definitely one of the strong elements. Overall, I would only recommend watching this anime if you have a hardened exterior and can easily digest such a dark, depressing, and tragic series.",3,Hauntingly Beautiful and Gruesomely Tragic,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,4098,"['Elfen', 'Lied', '13', 'episode', 'anime', 'series', 'based', 'seinen', 'manga', 'same', 'name', 'Lynn', 'Okamoto', 'who', 'guy', 'way', 'first', 'name', 'various', 'dark', 'tragic', 'themes', 'such', 'Love', 'Hatred', 'Regret', 'Innocence', 'Forgiveness', 'duality', 'human', 'nature', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Lucy', 'who', 'queen', 'mutant', 'offshoot', 'humanity', 'known', 'Diclonius', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'distinguishable', 'ordinary', 'humans', 'two', 'cat-ear', 'horns', 'head', 'invisible', 'arms', 'known', 'vectors', 'have', 'ability', 'slice', 'objects', 'lightning', 'fast', 'speed', 'yes', 'human', 'flesh', 'vectors', 'also', 'have', 'ability', 'infect', 'ordinary', 'humans', 'Diclonius', 'virus', 'children', 'are', 'born', 'Diclonius', 'instead', 'ordinary', 'humans', 'interactions', 'two', 'races', 'prejudice', 'animosity', 'due', 'mostly', 'fact', 'Diclonius', 'have', 'horns', 'human', 'do', 'not', 'rather', 'silly', 'surface', 'delve', 'deeper', 'prejudice', 'results', 'such', 'small', 'differences', 'such', 'skin', 'tone', 'far', 'more', 'sense', 'Elfen', 'Lied', 'mixed', 'bag', 'one', 'hand', 'animation', 'sound', 'quality', 'music', 'very', 'detailed', 'beautiful', 'most', 'time', 'really', 'giving', 'series', 'very', 'deep', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'feel', 'blend', 'dark', 'light', 'elements', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'series', 'scenes', 'dark', 'horror', 'sadness', 'tragedy', 'scenes', 'wacky', 'comedy', 'hi-jinks', 'ultra', 'moe', 'cuteness', 'mostly', 'revolving', 'split', 'personality', 'Lucy', 'innocent', 'childlike', 'Nyu', 'quite', 'nicely', 'However', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'negatives', 'series', 'most', 'notably', 'endless', 'slew', 'blood', 'gore', 'nudity', 'feels', 'incredibly', 'forced', 'unnecessary', 'addition', 'cruelty', 'malice', 'many', 'characters', 'human', 'diclonius', 'incredibly', 'forced', 'unnatural', 'most', 'notably', 'certain', 'scene', 'involving', 'lost', 'dog', 'owner.In', 'addition', 'voice', 'acting', 'English', 'version', 'decent', 'best', 'characters', 'most', 'notably', 'Bando', 'Lucy', 'Nana', 'Yuka', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'others', 'Kouta', 'Kurama', 'Mayu', 'Kanae', 'definitely', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'entire', 'anime', 'series', 'length', 'as', 'well', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'order', 'finish', 'series', 'have', 'read', 'manga', 'anime', 'based', 'quite', 'clear', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'anime', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'ending', 'manga', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'mysteries', 'untold', 'unexplained', 'end', 'anime', 'series', 'perhaps', 'else', 'ruined', 'overall', 'score', 'series', 'Elfen', 'Lied', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'only', 'turned', 'out', 'good', 'end', 'shame', 'really.Now', 'plot', 'characters', 'basic', 'plot', 'focuses', 'two', 'teenage', 'college', 'students', 'Kouta', 'Yuka', 'finding', 'naked', 'horned', 'girl', 'beach', 'said', 'naked', 'girl', 'brutally', 'murders', 'hordes', 'armed', 'soldiers', 'first', 'scene', 'first', 'episode', 'now', 'far', 'more', 'innocent', 'harmless', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'Nyu', 'take', 'home', 'bothering', 'contact', 'police', 'name', 'Nyu', 'However', 'murderous', 'sadistic', 'personality', 'not', 'gone', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'course', 'series', 'repeated', 'attempts', 'staff', 'scientists', 'facility', 'contained', 'first', 'capture', 'then', 'kill', 'Meanwhile', 'Kouta', 'as', 'well', 'Lucy', 'seem', 'share', 'strange', 'mysterious', 'bond', 'left', 'supposedly', 'unknown', 'last', 'episodes', 'series', 'well', 'educated', 'viewer', 'will', 'guess', 'bond', 'share', 'long', 'big', 'reveal', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'numerous', 'flashbacks', 'add', 'very', 'psychological', 'element', 'series', 'quite', 'mysterious', 'frightening', 'definitely', 'one', 'strong', 'elements', 'Overall', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'watching', 'anime', 'have', 'hardened', 'exterior', 'can', 'easily', 'digest', 'such', 'dark', 'depressing', 'tragic', 'series']",Elfen Lied Complete Collection
1496437,A1KVBBRXQ2PWJ7,B005OK0YU2,Siklootd,"[12, 15]","Elfen Lied is an anime of legend these days.  Touted by many as being ""the most violent anime series created"", there is more than meets the eye to the short series.  The anime does an excellent job of incorporating several various themes and subjects into the episodes, and captures a wide range of emotions in the process.  At first appearing to be nothing more than a exploitative series about gore, violence, murder, and the super natural, the series is actually quite deep, quite touching, and yes it is also quite depressing.The story begins in a laboratory, where a young girl is seen escaping her confines within the depths of the storage chamber in which the scientists contained her.  The girl has no problem or hesitation in killing everyone who gets in her way.  Yet, her manner of dispensing of her foes is not yet explained.  Magically all of the soldiers and scientists who confront the girl are torn to pieces, while the girl is free to continue walking, as if nothing occurred whatsoever.  The girl's name is revealed to be ""Lucy"", and it becomes obvious to the viewer that something is not right about Lucy.After escaping from the restraints of the laboratory, Lucy is found on shore of a local beach by two adolescents, one male (Kouta) and one female (Yuka).  Upon discovering her body upon shore, Lucy no longer appears to be the same violent person that was just depicted within the lab where she escaped.  Reverting to a somewhat ""child like"" personality, Lucy is no longer capable of speaking full words, resorting to one word and one word alone ""Nyu"".  As a result, the two teenagers decide to take her in as family and name her ""Nyu"".As the story progresses, the viewers find out the backstory behind Lucy/Nyu, and why she was within the lab to begin with.  Here is where the story takes a turn in emotions.  The backstory behind Lucy and her actions is quite sorrowful, and tear-jerking.  The troubles she encountered formed a psyche within the girl that she could no longer control.At times the series can depict images of things such as human decapitation, animal slaughtering, and disembowelment.  However, there are moments where Elfen Lied is sexual, with nudity and sexual jokes and innuendos.  Other times the episodes can actually be quite depressing and hard to watch.  This wide range of emotions keeps the viewer intrigued and coming back for me.  As the series progresses it becomes difficult to stop watching as the story becomes more clear and more surreal to the viewer.Elfen Lied accomplishes several things that no other anime can claim: providing a violent anime series while creating a story with characters that people can actually care about and feel for.  Not just another violent anime that goes nowhere, Elfen Lied has a story to tell, and it's a story that any anime fan should listen to.",5,"Dark, Violent, Disturbing...Yet Touching and Sorrowful",1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,2839,"['Elfen', 'Lied', 'anime', 'legend', 'days', 'Touted', 'many', 'being', 'most', 'violent', 'anime', 'series', 'created', 'more', 'eye', 'short', 'series', 'anime', 'excellent', 'job', 'incorporating', 'several', 'various', 'themes', 'subjects', 'episodes', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'process', 'first', 'appearing', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'exploitative', 'series', 'gore', 'violence', 'murder', 'super', 'natural', 'series', 'actually', 'quite', 'deep', 'quite', 'touching', 'yes', 'also', 'quite', 'depressing.The', 'story', 'laboratory', 'where', 'young', 'girl', 'seen', 'escaping', 'confines', 'depths', 'storage', 'chamber', 'scientists', 'contained', 'girl', 'problem', 'hesitation', 'killing', 'everyone', 'who', 'way', 'manner', 'dispensing', 'foes', 'not', 'yet', 'explained', 'Magically', 'soldiers', 'scientists', 'who', 'confront', 'girl', 'are', 'torn', 'pieces', 'girl', 'free', 'continue', 'walking', 'nothing', 'occurred', 'whatsoever', 'girl', 'name', 'revealed', 'be', 'Lucy', 'obvious', 'viewer', 'something', 'not', 'right', 'Lucy.After', 'escaping', 'restraints', 'laboratory', 'Lucy', 'found', 'shore', 'local', 'beach', 'two', 'adolescents', 'one', 'male', 'Kouta', 'one', 'female', 'Yuka', 'discovering', 'body', 'shore', 'Lucy', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'same', 'violent', 'person', 'was', 'just', 'depicted', 'lab', 'where', 'escaped', 'Reverting', 'somewhat', 'child', 'personality', 'Lucy', 'no', 'longer', 'capable', 'speaking', 'full', 'words', 'resorting', 'one', 'word', 'one', 'word', 'alone', 'Nyu', 'result', 'two', 'teenagers', 'decide', 'take', 'family', 'name', 'Nyu', 'story', 'viewers', 'find', 'out', 'backstory', 'Lucy/Nyu', 'why', 'was', 'lab', 'begin', 'Here', 'where', 'story', 'turn', 'emotions', 'backstory', 'Lucy', 'actions', 'quite', 'sorrowful', 'tear-jerking', 'troubles', 'encountered', 'formed', 'psyche', 'girl', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'control.At', 'times', 'series', 'can', 'depict', 'images', 'things', 'such', 'human', 'decapitation', 'animal', 'slaughtering', 'disembowelment', 'However', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'Elfen', 'Lied', 'sexual', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'jokes', 'innuendos', 'Other', 'times', 'episodes', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'quite', 'depressing', 'hard', 'watch', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'keeps', 'viewer', 'intrigued', 'coming', 'back', 'series', 'difficult', 'stop', 'watching', 'story', 'more', 'clear', 'more', 'surreal', 'viewer.Elfen', 'Lied', 'several', 'things', 'other', 'anime', 'can', 'claim', 'providing', 'violent', 'anime', 'series', 'creating', 'story', 'characters', 'people', 'can', 'actually', 'care', 'feel', 'Not', 'just', 'violent', 'anime', 'nowhere', 'Elfen', 'Lied', 'story', 'tell', 'story', 'anime', 'fan', 'should', 'listen']",Elfen Lied Complete Collection

It has a fair amount of fan service if you like to see naked Anime girls, it has a good amount of blood shed and it has a very solid story line. I felt it was well written and for the most part, well executed. My biggest complaint was that the last episode seemed rushed. I think they should have made one more episode in this series to help wrap things up. I don't want to talk about the story as I don't want to write any spoilers but I can say that as the show progresses, it flashes back on the past and everything ties together for a full circle story that is successfully executed.

It's got everything in gratuity and it's like someone thought to themselves 'how can I make the most horribly violent, messed up, psychotic anime ever and still include the harem/cute innocent cat girl themes into it? Well, that's basically what you get. The show basically flip-flops between Lucy either being a cute, stupid bimbo catgirl who is just dying to get the main male character to touch her in sexual ways, to suddenly being a sadistic hellhound out to make mincemeat of everything that moves. The show is bloody and horrifying in all the wrong ways, like the creators were trying their hardest to squeeze in more gallons of blood and torture in every fight scene just because. Then the harem aspect, ya know, just because. And in case that's not enough, you get animal cruelty, child pornography/sexual harassment/abuse/murder, and every other thing they could throw in to make you even more depressed.For me, watching anime is about seeing the creation of characters and story in ways that make me care about them, to want to watch right to the end, to laugh and cry. Elfen Lied gave me absolutely none of those things. It is depressing, loaded with gratuitous atrocities and the characters are shallow and play out every stereotypical role that has given anime a bad rap. I honestly have no idea *how* this anime has been given such a large amount of great reviews, but I am not one to follow the crowd on this one.

Now its been a few years ,and as the boy comes back to the town he ends up running in to her. As she tries to rekindle the relationship that they once had he is left clueless to who she is ,and her intentions. Not to mention overwhelmed by the other females that want his attention including his cousin who wants him for herself.

For newer fans, I can't personally vouch for the Blu-Ray, but would recommend it. The box set has been discontinued, and is very hard to get a ""like new"" or ""good"" condition for a decent price.Ok this series is for sure my favorite. solid Action, gore, mature, romance & tragedy all in 13 episodes.THAT BEING SAID, the anime was completed before manga was even finished. That left the producer to force in his own ending to wrap up the anime (was only alloted 13 episodes). I think he did a god job at doing so, but just the mere fact that the anime will only tell maybe half of the whole story will leave you with a ""WTF, that was it?"" feeling at the end. Also, aside from 1 or 2 characters, the voice overs are horrible if you're looking for a dubbed edition.

This is by far the most controversial anime ever made.STORYElfen Lied takes place in Kamakura, Japan, focusing on a new strain of the human race, Diclonius, similar to human beings with invisible arms called vectors but different at the genetic level and notable due to physical abnormalities, particularly a pair of short horn-like protrusions. One such Diclonius, Lucy, is the main character of the series: Initially held in a facility built for experimentation, located off the coast of Kamakura, she manages to escape and wreak havoc, but is injured in the process, an event which causes her to develop a secondary, childlike personality known as Nyu.Lucy is found by two locals, Kohta, who studies at the local university, and his cousin Yuka. They take her in, and become involved with the numerous, often brutal, attempts to recapture her by a Special Assault Team and a number of other Diclonius, who shift frequently from oblivious to murderous.I would hate to tell you any spoilers to this flawless anime. The story is so complex that it makes you want to keep watching to see what is next to come. This is truly the best story arms has to offer.SEXUALITYI warn you, the sexuality is rather explict, and it is not recommended for any child to watch. You will see constant breast shots, butt shots, also, this may exceed your low tolerance, but there is child molestation depicted, incest, and rape. However, these thing bring a much deeper tone to the anime.VIOLENCEThere is non stop gore throughout the entire anime. You may get a headache from all the blood, guts, and gore flying out. It's really cool too.ANIMATIONThis is definitely the best animation that has been used in anime history. The amount of value, texture, contrast, line, and color used on the characters is beyond great.VOICE ACTINGThe voice acting is most memorable, especially lucy/nyu. The english dubbing is terrific! I didn't hear the japanese dub yet. But the english dubbing is surprisingly really good.CHARACTERSEach character has their own part. No one steals the show. Since many characters are introduced throughout the series, you will be trying to focus on as much detail each character as they present themselves.SOUNDTRACKLilum, is a memorable soundtrack. It conveys meaning throughout the entire series. There is a reason fans love this soundtrack so much.VERDICTElfen lied is arguably the greatest anime ever made because of it's compelling story, it's use of symbols and foreshadowing. The series is only 13 episodes long, it includes an OVA which was never released on the North American import. Otaku's, if you have not seen elfen lied yet, you are in for something special. So check this anime out, there is a reason everyone loves it.",5,My favorite anime of all time!,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,2799,"['Elfen', 'lied', 'use', 'foreshadowing', 'play', 'viewer', 'expectations', 'far', 'most', 'controversial', 'anime', 'ever', 'made.STORYElfen', 'Lied', 'place', 'Kamakura', 'Japan', 'focusing', 'new', 'strain', 'human', 'race', 'Diclonius', 'similar', 'human', 'beings', 'invisible', 'arms', 'called', 'vectors', 'different', 'genetic', 'level', 'notable', 'due', 'physical', 'abnormalities', 'particularly', 'pair', 'short', 'horn-like', 'protrusions', 'One', 'such', 'Diclonius', 'Lucy', 'main', 'character', 'series', 'Initially', 'held', 'facility', 'built', 'experimentation', 'located', 'coast', 'Kamakura', 'escape', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'injured', 'process', 'event', 'develop', 'secondary', 'childlike', 'personality', 'known', 'Nyu.Lucy', 'found', 'two', 'locals', 'Kohta', 'who', 'studies', 'local', 'university', 'cousin', 'Yuka', 'take', 'become', 'involved', 'numerous', 'often', 'brutal', 'attempts', 'recapture', 'Special', 'Assault', 'Team', 'number', 'other', 'Diclonius', 'who', 'shift', 'frequently', 'oblivious', 'murderous.I', 'would', 'hate', 'tell', 'spoilers', 'flawless', 'anime', 'story', 'so', 'complex', 'want', 'keep', 'watching', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'come', 'truly', 'best', 'story', 'arms', 'offer.SEXUALITYI', 'warn', 'sexuality', 'rather', 'explict', 'not', 'recommended', 'child', 'watch', 'will', 'see', 'constant', 'breast', 'shots', 'butt', 'shots', 'also', 'may', 'exceed', 'low', 'tolerance', 'child', 'molestation', 'depicted', 'incest', 'rape', 'However', 'thing', 'bring', 'much', 'deeper', 'tone', 'anime.VIOLENCEThere', 'non', 'stop', 'gore', 'entire', 'anime', 'may', 'get', 'headache', 'blood', 'guts', 'gore', 'flying', 'out', 'really', 'cool', 'too.ANIMATIONThis', 'definitely', 'best', 'animation', 'been', 'used', 'anime', 'history', 'amount', 'value', 'texture', 'contrast', 'line', 'color', 'used', 'characters', 'great.VOICE', 'ACTINGThe', 'voice', 'acting', 'most', 'memorable', 'especially', 'lucy/nyu', 'english', 'dubbing', 'terrific', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'japanese', 'dub', 'yet', 'english', 'dubbing', 'surprisingly', 'really', 'good.CHARACTERSEach', 'character', 'own', 'part', 'one', 'show', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'trying', 'focus', 'as', 'much', 'detail', 'character', 'present', 'themselves.SOUNDTRACKLilum', 'memorable', 'soundtrack', 'meaning', 'entire', 'series', 'reason', 'fans', 'love', 'soundtrack', 'so', 'much.VERDICTElfen', 'lied', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'anime', 'ever', 'made', 'compelling', 'story', 'use', 'symbols', 'foreshadowing', 'series', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'long', 'OVA', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'North', 'American', 'import', 'Otaku', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'elfen', 'lied', 'yet', 'are', 'something', 'special', 'So', 'check', 'anime', 'out', 'reason', 'everyone']",Elfen Lied Complete Collection
