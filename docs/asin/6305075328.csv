446205,A34PAZQ73SL163,6305075328,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[5, 6]","In my mind, this is Allen's blackest film.  He plunges the depth of the human existence and finds that there is little redeeming about our lives.  Judaic figures like Rabbi Ben and the family father are set up as straw men who argue that God sees everything and that there is a moral center to the universe.  The character of Judah, and his actions in the movie, suggest that they were wrong.  Their views are also refuted during the Passover seder scene, and later when the philosopher who is so admired commits suicide after writing the simple phrase, ""I've gone out the window.""The worldview of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is not one that I agree with but the excellence of the film is undeniable.  The characters come together perfectly and Allen's own role of ""loser"" is outstanding.  There is considerable humor here as well, such as the documentary that is made about Lester [Allen Alda] where he is compared to Mussolini and a bellowing mule.  Yet, on the whole, the movie is more bitter than sweet, but it was a great achievement for Allen.

446206,A20IIR0422G3A5,6305075328,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[18, 20]","`Crimes and Misdemeanors' written and directed by Woody Allen may very well be Allen's best film to date. It is a straight drama with intermixed humor. It has no parody or self-reference like `Stardust Memories', it has no gimmicks like `Annie Hall', and it is not leadenly serious like `Interiors'. While this does not necessarily make it a better movie, it has what seems to be the largest `name' cast of all Allen's works, even though he is able to attract `name' actors like flies to honey. It even has a real plot where events early in the movie create situations to which you expect a resolution by the time the credits roll.There is a very neat symmetry between two parallel series of events in the movie. The parallelism and it's nature are signaled by the title and the promise is realized far better than other works with similar titles. The liner notes compare the subject in this movie with `Love and Death', but I think the comparison is strained at best. The real issues in this movie are guilt and loss.The Crime is the murder of Landau's mistress (Angelica Houston) arranged by Landau's brother (Jerry Orbach), a gangster with access to contract killers. The motive for the murder is fact that the mistress has become impatient in her expectation that Landau will leave his wife (Claire Bloom) and threatens to reveal the infidelity to Bloom and the world. What makes the risk to Landau even greater is that he is a very successful and wealthy doctor of ophthalmology who has contributed much to local hospitals and other charities.The Misdemeanor is the dalliance of Allen's character with his assistant (Mia Farrow) while his marriage with wife Joanna Gleason is souring. The connection between Allen and Landau is based on the fact that one of Gleason's brothers is a rabbi (Sam Waterston) who is going blind and is being treated by Ophthalmologist Landau. The misdemeanor plot is enriched by Gleason's other brother, a highly successful television producer gloriously played with great ambiguity by Alan Alda's slipping between attractive and unattractive traits as easily as a duck takes to water.Allen is a marginally successful documentary filmmaker whose great ambition is to do a documentary on the life of a philosopher (probably a professor at NYU, loosely based perhaps on Sydney Hook). He is hooked up with Alda's TV producer to do a biographical documentary on the producer's career for PBS. Alda recommends Allen to PBS only as a favor to his sister.While the events leading to the `Crime' causes intense guilt and remorse on the part of Landau, his connection to the crime goes undetected by the police and he wakes up one morning with his sense of guilt lifted from his shoulders. The irony is that Allen's trivial misdemeanor is published by his loosing his wife, loosing his contract to do the documentary for the producer, and loosing his potential romantic interest (Farrow) to Alda.I'm reluctant to give away much more of the plots, but I will say that the events are shot through with this kind of irony, including the fact that while Landau gets off Scott free, the rabbi, a totally virtuous character, goes blind. On top of this, the two principles are depicted in such a way that you admire the criminal, Landau and feel little sympathy for his victim or the inept, nebbish filmmaker who gets the short end of the stick from all his colleagues and relatives.And through all of this, there is a finely crafted vein of humor, including a little aphorism from Alda on the nature of humor when he says that `If it bends, its funny. If it breaks, it's not'.This movie twists and turns and bends and threatens to break, and never does. Truly one of Allen's best!.",5,"If it bends its funny, if it breaks it isn't.

His guilt feelings wear off after a while.

It's hardly funny at all, and soon begins to feel like a philosophical tract on the obvious.

In addition, the very nature of success, both of the  romantic and artistic variety, is given an extensive treatment. In vintage  Woody fashion, he asks how, in a godless, indifferent universe, can man be  expected to maintain a lasting moral structure? If the conscience of an  individual is truly without guilt and the institutions of the state have  failed to apprehend a transgressor, has he or she truly &quot;gotten away  with it?&quot; What constitutes compromise and how well can (and should) we  put up with it? Woody continues to equate awards and social praise with  artistic prostitution and the truest sign of moral bankruptcy, and he  refuses to soften the harsh reality that everything, including life, death,  and love are mere instruments, tools in a worldwide marketplace where all  is truly up for sale. But have I mentioned the acting? And the acerbic  screenplay? And the rich social satire?

446211,A1YYBC3O7KHQKK,6305075328,Carter,"[0, 0]","Very satisfying to review twenty-four years after its making, here's a film that will continue to be admired and reviewed by film lovers for another twenty-four years and well beyond. A successful and respected ophthalmologist must take action to hide from his family and his circle the affair he's been having with another woman. But just how far will his conscience allow him to go? Here's a film that pulls together all of the prime components of great cinema and dazzles scene after scene. Yet rising above all of this, and despite a picture rich in one consummate performance after another, Martin Landau is towering and shines in just about the performance of a lifetime. Love or hate his character, the debonair Landau drives the film, is absolutely captivating, and is clearly the captain of this ensemble team of well respected actors doing stellar work. Though nominated for an Academy Award for Crimes, Landau oddly didn't win the Oscar he so richly deserved. He would have to wait until 1995 to receive his statue for Ed Wood, beating out Gary Sinise's impeccable performance in Forrest Gump. The story of course raises large questions about morality, punishment, and conscience, and we eventually discover that the real question the film asks is why good people do bad things. Nothing is answered conclusively, though the story suggests some ugly possibilities about choice and the utilitarianism of human nature. But while Allen vacillates between questioning the naivete of faith (in moral structure) and then showing great reverence for it, he gives us a satisfyingly contemplative (and funny) film, as usual. It's both serious and irreverent, weighty and witty, always seeming to strike just the right balance between the sober and the comedic. This is art that deals squarely with the most difficult of topics but is at the same time joyful like all art that reminds us that life, though sometimes bitter, is also sweet.  Though the films need not be viewed in any particular order, Allen revisits these same questions many years later in the brilliant Match Point. A few might object to what they see as another example of the film-maker's excessive focus on &#8220;elitist&#8221; cerebralism, too much &#8220;living inside your head&#8221; as one amazon reviewer wrote (of another Allen film). But Allen is no elitist, and the story's central characters range from the privileged to the ordinary. Crimes and Misdemeanors has enjoyed immense critical and popular reviews over the years. For many, this is what going to the movies is all about. Allen and film-makers like him need never apologize for making thoughtful films about thoughtful people. A film can entertain without giving folks much to think about, but great films in almost every case do both. The answers to all questions raised may not be neatly wrapped up by the film's end, but &#8220;If you want a happy ending, you should go see a Hollywood movie.&#8221;",5,Landau is Towering,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,2943,"['Very', 'satisfying', 'review', 'twenty-four', 'years', 'making', 'here', 'film', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'admired', 'reviewed', 'film', 'lovers', 'twenty-four', 'years', 'well', 'successful', 'respected', 'ophthalmologist', 'must', 'take', 'action', 'hide', 'family', 'circle', 'affair', 'been', 'having', 'woman', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'conscience', 'allow', 'go', 'Here', 'film', 'together', 'prime', 'components', 'great', 'cinema', 'dazzles', 'scene', 'scene', 'rising', 'picture', 'rich', 'one', 'consummate', 'performance', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'towering', 'shines', 'just', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Love', 'hate', 'character', 'debonair', 'Landau', 'film', 'absolutely', 'captivating', 'clearly', 'captain', 'ensemble', 'team', 'well', 'respected', 'actors', 'doing', 'stellar', 'work', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Crimes', 'Landau', 'oddly', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'so', 'richly', 'deserved', 'would', 'have', 'wait', '1995', 'receive', 'statue', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'beating', 'out', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'impeccable', 'performance', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'story', 'course', 'raises', 'large', 'questions', 'morality', 'punishment', 'conscience', 'eventually', 'discover', 'real', 'question', 'film', 'why', 'good', 'people', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'Nothing', 'answered', 'conclusively', 'story', 'ugly', 'possibilities', 'choice', 'utilitarianism', 'human', 'nature', 'Allen', 'vacillates', 'questioning', 'naivete', 'faith', 'moral', 'structure', 'then', 'showing', 'great', 'reverence', 'satisfyingly', 'contemplative', 'funny', 'film', 'usual', 'serious', 'irreverent', 'weighty', 'witty', 'always', 'seeming', 'strike', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'sober', 'comedic', 'art', 'deals', 'squarely', 'most', 'difficult', 'topics', 'same', 'time', 'joyful', 'art', 'life', 'sometimes', 'bitter', 'also', 'sweet', 'films', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'viewed', 'particular', 'order', 'Allen', 'same', 'questions', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'brilliant', 'Match', 'Point', 'A', 'few', 'might', 'object', 'what', 'see', 'example', 'film-maker', 'excessive', 'focus', '8220', '8221', 'cerebralism', 'too', 'much', '8220', 'living', 'head', '8221', 'one', 'amazon', 'reviewer', 'wrote', 'Allen', 'film', 'Allen', 'elitist', 'story', 'central', 'characters', 'range', 'privileged', 'ordinary', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'enjoyed', 'immense', 'critical', 'popular', 'reviews', 'years', 'many', 'what', 'going', 'movies', 'Allen', 'film-makers', 'need', 'never', 'apologize', 'making', 'thoughtful', 'films', 'thoughtful', 'people', 'film', 'can', 'entertain', 'giving', 'folks', 'much', 'think', 'great', 'films', 'almost', 'case', 'do', 'answers', 'questions', 'raised', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'neatly', 'wrapped', 'up', 'film', 'end', '8220', 'want', 'happy', 'ending', 'should', 'go', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'movie.', '8221']",N/A
446212,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,6305075328,C. Middleton,"[1, 2]","~Crimes and Misdemeanors~ is one of Woody Allen's more acclaimed motion pictures. Not since 'Hannah and Her Sisters' had the critics as well as the American public gave it the attention and praise that most of his films deserve. Allen has commented many times that people in his native land, generally, stay away from his pictures in droves. In fact, he has also said, that aside from a small American following, and a substantial European audience, he'd be out of business completely. ~Crimes~ is a unique and decidedly intelligent film that addresses some weighty religious, philosophical and psychological questions, and still managed to gain attention and sell a few tickets at the American box office.Martin Landau (who won an Oscar for Best Actor) plays Judas - a successful optician caught at the receiving end of his mistresses (Angelica Huston) neurotic threats of revealing their two-year love affair to his wife and the world. Judas's dilemma peaks when his mistress, in a last ditch effort to get him back, threatens to reveal some unscrupulous business dealings in his past. Offers of money and pleas for forgiveness work to no avail until Judas is compelled to do something drastic. The man created two lives, and one is about to destroy the other. He decides to contact his long lost unscrupulous brother, and rationalize that the only way to solve the problem is to fix the mistress - permanently. (Crime)Woody Allen plays an unhappily married, frustrated documentary filmmaker. Pitted against his egotistical and successful filmmaker brother-in-law (Alan Alda) who hires him to make a biographical documentary about his life. It is here that the Allen character entertains the idea of having an affair with one of the producers, (Mia Farrow) and makes some feeble efforts to do so but the affair is doomed to failure. (Misdemeanor)This film is about making ethical choices in one's life and the various ways one can deal with the consequences of those choices. What is right and wrong? When one transgresses against what one perceives as ethical behaviour, personally and socially, is it human nature to justify and rationalize the transgression to the point where life is bearable enough to continue? Is our behaviour monitored by an all-seeing-eye, God, and at the end of our lives, will we be brought into account for our transgressions? In other words, is there divine justice? Is it 'only in the movies' that a murderer would turn themselves into the police, confront the evil deed, and assume responsibility?The genius of this film is its ability to address these philosophical and psychological issues and tell it in a manner that is thought provoking, humorous and entertaining all at the same time.This DVD would be a valuable addition to any serious film lover's collection, whether a fan of Woody Allen or not.",4,Thought Provoking and Humorous.,1033430400,"10 1, 2002",2002,2838,"['~Crimes', 'Misdemeanors~', 'one', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'more', 'acclaimed', 'motion', 'pictures', 'Not', ""'Hannah"", 'Sisters', 'had', 'critics', 'as', 'well', 'American', 'public', 'gave', 'attention', 'praise', 'most', 'films', 'deserve', 'Allen', 'commented', 'many', 'times', 'people', 'native', 'land', 'generally', 'stay', 'away', 'pictures', 'droves', 'fact', 'also', 'said', 'aside', 'small', 'American', 'following', 'substantial', 'European', 'audience', ""'d"", 'be', 'business', 'completely', '~Crimes~', 'unique', 'decidedly', 'intelligent', 'film', 'weighty', 'religious', 'philosophical', 'psychological', 'questions', 'still', 'managed', 'gain', 'attention', 'sell', 'few', 'tickets', 'American', 'box', 'office.Martin', 'Landau', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Judas', 'successful', 'optician', 'caught', 'receiving', 'end', 'mistresses', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'neurotic', 'threats', 'revealing', 'two-year', 'love', 'affair', 'wife', 'world', 'Judas', 'dilemma', 'peaks', 'when', 'mistress', 'last', 'ditch', 'effort', 'get', 'back', 'reveal', 'unscrupulous', 'business', 'dealings', 'past', 'Offers', 'money', 'pleas', 'forgiveness', 'work', 'avail', 'Judas', 'compelled', 'do', 'something', 'drastic', 'man', 'created', 'two', 'lives', 'one', 'destroy', 'other', 'contact', 'long', 'lost', 'unscrupulous', 'brother', 'rationalize', 'only', 'way', 'solve', 'problem', 'fix', 'mistress', 'permanently', 'Crime', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'unhappily', 'married', 'frustrated', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'Pitted', 'egotistical', 'successful', 'filmmaker', 'brother-in-law', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'who', 'make', 'biographical', 'documentary', 'life', 'here', 'Allen', 'character', 'idea', 'having', 'affair', 'one', 'producers', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'feeble', 'efforts', 'do', 'so', 'affair', 'doomed', 'failure', 'Misdemeanor', 'film', 'making', 'ethical', 'choices', 'one', 'life', 'various', 'ways', 'one', 'can', 'deal', 'consequences', 'choices', 'What', 'right', 'wrong', 'When', 'one', 'what', 'one', 'ethical', 'behaviour', 'personally', 'socially', 'human', 'nature', 'justify', 'rationalize', 'transgression', 'point', 'where', 'life', 'bearable', 'enough', 'continue', 'behaviour', 'monitored', 'all-seeing-eye', 'God', 'end', 'lives', 'will', 'be', 'brought', 'account', 'transgressions', 'other', 'words', 'there', 'divine', 'justice', ""'only"", 'movies', 'murderer', 'would', 'turn', 'police', 'confront', 'evil', 'deed', 'assume', 'responsibility', 'genius', 'film', 'ability', 'address', 'philosophical', 'psychological', 'issues', 'tell', 'manner', 'thought', 'provoking', 'humorous', 'entertaining', 'same', 'time.This', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'valuable', 'addition', 'serious', 'film', 'lover', 'collection', 'fan', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'not']",N/A
446213,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6305075328,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 2]","A good example of why the screenplay is so great is the character of Dolores Paley, played by Anjelica Huston. She is a minor character; in essence serving as the `in' to Judah Rosenthal, but Allen does not skimp. She is a fully realized character. Look at the scene where she is recalling her past with Judah, and we then see her soberly staring off into the ether. The door bell rings, she runs to it, and embraces Judah. We get the memory, which is positive, her reflection, which makes her seem to rue it, her desperation in running to the door, and then her blackmail threat. In a minute or so we get a complex arc of a character. But, while fully developed, she is also used as a device to get the viewer to sympathize with the amoral Judah. Her whininess, pettiness, self-importance, self-deceits, threats to Judah and his family, all make us dislike her, well rounded or not, and subtly make us actually want Judah to off her. Thus we are subliminally made to feel what Judah feels, and thus a small sense of complicity and guilt is rooted in most viewers. Yet, Allen does not settle for the easy out of having us totally on Judah's anti-heroic side, either. He is not Godzilla, and we do not totally want him to step on and/pr fry the scurrying little Japs that flee from his rampage. Instead, we see that he is a hypocrite and coward, unwilling (until the film's end) to accept his amorality. I earlier mentioned the scene where he invites his brother up to his home, just so he can pawn off the first mention of murder on Jack (who, in a great moment, exasperates that Judah was never comfortable playing `hardball' in life), and this act is almost as repulsive as the act of murder he finances, and Judah is an even more despicable character than his brother, for he has the means to avoid such actions, and chooses not to.Yet, the screenplay's excellence is not out of tricks, even there, for  we then get the film's resolution, which clearly rewards and glorifies those people (unethical or not) who are strong and bold, and crushes those who are equivocal and weak. Amongst the lot of `winners' are the Rosenthal brothers (especially Judah), Wendy Stern, Lester, and Barbara's date. Amongst the `losers' are Cliff Stern, Dolores Paley, Professor Levy, Barbara, and Ben the rabbi. About the only exception to the rule is the equivocal Halley, yet she is `won' by Lester. All of the winners are decisive and create their own lives, whereas Cliff and his sister indulge in romantic fantasies (he's an unemployed, married filmmaker, short and not handsome, and he really thinks Halley will choose him over the rich, single, and handsome Lester?). By contrast, the winners cut their losses, and look askance at the worst possible outcomes they could suffer. And they succeed.Unusually, the critical reception of the film was almost wholly positive. The lone exception was the Chicago Reader's ridiculously bad Jonathan Rosenbaum who wrote:The first ""serious"" Woody Allen film with Jewish characters (1989) might seem like an improvement after the pseudoprofundities of Interiors et al, but it can't be said to dig any deeper. Martin Landau plays a wealthy ophthalmologist who plots the murder of his mistress (Anjelica Huston) when she threatens to expose his adultery and embezzlement. In quasi-comic counterpoint is the plight of an unsuccessful documentary filmmaker (Allen) who's stuck in an unhappy marriage, goes to work for his obnoxious brother-in-law (Alan Alda), a successful producer of TV sitcoms, and falls in love with one of his assistants (Mia Farrow). The overall ""philosophical"" thrust--that good guys finish last and that crime does pay--is designed to make the audience feel very wise, but none of the characters or ideas is allowed to develop beyond its cardboard profile (though Alda has a ball with his part). With Claire Bloom and Sam Waterston (as the perfect all-purpose symbolic Allen character--a rabbi going blind).Cardboard characters? Does not dig deeper? What film was Rosenbaum watching? I mean, he's known for being both a poor critic and writer, but this is like claiming 2001: A Space Odyssey had bad special effects. It's simply not tenable, whether or not he subjectively `liked' the film.No, Rosenbaum is as wrong as one can be, and Judah Rosenthal and Crimes And Misdemeanors are artistic creations on par with two of Akira Kurosawa's greatest meditations on evil: the evil and victorious vice president in The Bad Sleep Well and the realism of the kidnapper in High And Low. The former film show the triumph of evil and the latter a realistic depiction of evil's randomness, which contrasts with Allen's film. And compared with two lesser takes of his own, on the same theme, Match Point and Cassandra's Dream, this film digs deeper and ends far better. Those two films have potential, but drop the ball, in the end. Judah Rosenthal didn't. He played the game, and won, and the next time he ever needs to really `win' in such a game of life, there will be no self-doubt nor flinching. He learned his lesson; that power and influence can let one cheat and kill with impunity. That's why he's real. That's why he's scary. That's why he's one of the greatest villains in not only film history, but the annals of human fiction. Because there are no supernatural Freddy Kruegers nor superhuman Hannibal Lecters in reality, only in Hollywood films; no matter how outrageous the tales are that come out about the latest serial killer du jour. But there really are Judah Rosenthals out there. They are life's `winners.' And they simply do not care about you or me. And, as the film shows and argues, why should they?",5,Masterpiece,1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,5659,"['good', 'example', 'why', 'screenplay', 'so', 'great', 'character', 'Dolores', 'Paley', 'played',

""Daniel""","[3, 4]","With INTERIORS, Woody Allen's CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS is the most pessimistic movie of the filmography of this major american director. Don't be afraid, it's not a tragic and existential movie &quot; &agrave; la Bergman  &quot; ! It's rather a tragi-comedy with laughs dying in your  throat.CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS is clearly divided into two different  stories : the first one, involving Woody Allen, is a melancholic tale about  an unhappy love affair between Allen and Mia Farrow. &quot; It's not fair  nor right &quot; is the only thought which will cross your mind at the end  of the movie. Shot in warm colours, with a jazzy musical score, it has some  vague resemblance with THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, another Woody Allen  masterpiece.The second story is raw, realistic, shot almost entirely at  night with cold blue tones. Martin Landau will get rid of his mistress, a  superb Anjelica Huston, and forget his guiltiness in front of the silence  of his conscience. It's also not fair but, hey !, I told you it was a  pessimistic movie.Woody Allen develops also two or three subtle ideas to  mark his point like the growing blindness of the Rabbi symbolizing the  disparition of a God punishing the bad ones and rewarding the good ones.  But it was only during the golden era of Hollywood that happy endings were  the common law.A scene access as sole extra-feature (thank you, thank  you, thank you !).

There is absolutely NO LOVE in ""Crimes and Misdemenors.""  Its all about male egotism.  For Allen, women exist merely for the sake a male's pleasure.  Powerful males can use any women in any way they desire and wimps like Allen are left with children to hook up with which is disgusting considering Woody Allen's personal life.  Since the main characters in this film are Jewish, one wonders if Allen is really antisemitic at heart.  His attitude has led us to the current morality of ""Sex and the City"" and ""The Sopranos.""  Angelica Houston gives a marvelous performance as the woman the powerful eye doctor paid to have murdered after he was finished with her.  She looked and sounded the part perfectly.  The only character who even alluded to love was a tv image of a psychiatrist who Allen had defenstered for no reason at all except Allen wanted him dead. Oh yes, an attractive young rabbi was kind and loving but Allen made him blind so he couldn't see what was going on around him probably.

Knoll,"[0, 0]","If you had the opportunity to rid yourself of an extremely annoying person who threatens your entire comfortable existence and emerge scot free, would you take it? Would you film a positive spin on a pompous ass of a media maven if that was the only way to secure much needed funding to finish your own heartfelt documentary about a philosopher's quest for meaning in life? Woody Allen poses such engrossing questions in his pitch black comedy of upper middle class manners, &#34;Crimes and Misdemeanors&#34;, his 25 year old masterpiece now available for the first time in a limited Twilight Time Blu-ray.Woody has been nominated 16 times for screenplay Oscars, and has won three: for &#34;Annie Hall&#34;(1977), &#34;Hannah and Her Sisters&#34;(1986) and &#34;Midnight in Paris&#34;(2011). Even in such celebrated company, &#34;Crimes&#34; stands out as the most penetrating and well knit of his New York based films as he explores the moral choices that define who his characters are and the course of their lives.While parallel story lines follow an extremely successful ophthalmologist (Martin Landau, in an Oscar nominated performance which is arguably his best) and a perennial failure of a documentary filmmaker (Woody himself, earning Best Director and Best Screenplay nominations) and their various romantic, sexual and familial relationships, no less than God himself figures prominently in the dialogue.Dr. Judah Rosenthal (Landau) finds his perfect seeming life upended by the demands of his mistress (Anjelica Huston), who morphs into a stalker when he tries to terminate their two year long affair. Driven to desperation because Dolores knows about his financial shenanigans (&#34;Moving funds around isn't stealing&#34;) as well, he plots with his hard edged brother (Jerry Orbach), to arrange a contract killing. Before and after the killing, Judah grapples with his conscience and the possibility of getting caught. In one of several soulful conversations with his life long friend Ben (Sam Waterston), a rabbi on the verge of blindness, Judah proclaims that &#34;God is a luxury I can't afford.&#34; In his fevered imagination, he interrogates his family members, especially his socialist aunt, at a long ago seder, raising profound moral and religious questions. His father espouses his belief in God, even over truth and expresses his governing credo: &#34;the eyes of God are on us always.&#34; Judah, however, is determined to put aside the guilt associated with the murder he orchestrated and continue with his life as if nothing had ever happened.Cliff, the documentary filmmaker, finds his job has been cancelled when the media mogul sees footage linking him to Mussolini; his ice princess of a wife, Wendy Stern (Joanna Gleason), who hasn't slept with him in the year since the anniversary of Hitler's birthday, has &#34;found someone&#34; as she says to her brother, the media mogul (Alan Alda) and the film producer (Mia Farrow, when the mutual flame burned hot) with whom Cliff has fallen in love, rejects him for the media mogul. The philosophy professor, whose search for meaning in what he fears is a cold and indifferent universe has been life-affirming, leaves a suicide note, saying simply, &#34;I went out the window.&#34;What's left? Well, since this is a Woody Allen movie, there are always old movies, such as the ones that Cliff watches with his niece and those he watches with the film producer, in a room surrounded with film stock andcanisters. Expert use is made of clips from Hitchcock's &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&#34;(1941),  with the line &#34;I've given you the best years of my life&#34; echoing Dolores' complaint to Judah and &#34;This Gun for Hire&#34; (1942), in which a squeamish character objects to the mention of cat gut as a murder weapon.Old music also permeates the soundtrack of &#34;Crimes&#34;; Cole Porter and Irving Berlin hold sway alongside J.S.Bach and Franz Schubert.There is so much to enjoy in &#34;Crimes&#34;, not the least of which is the evocative and perfectly lit cinematography of Sven Nykvist, the longtime medium of Ingmar Bergman, Woody's primal inspiration since the days of &#34;Love and Death&#34;(1975).&#34;Crimes&#34; is a perfect finale to a decade which began with &#34;Manhattan&#34;(1979) and embraced &#34;The Purple Rose of Cairo&#34;(1985), &#34;Hannah and her Sisters&#34; and &#34;Radio Days&#34;(1987). Savor the best video incarnation of &#34;Crimes and Misdemeanors&#34;. Appreciate its brilliance.

446224,A3B25R48M37T01,6305075328,Edward J. Baker,"[11, 46]","Examining theodicy, the enigma of reconciling a benevolent God with capricious fate and suffering, Woody Allen fails to get much beyond a dark comic-dramatization of a freshman philosophy bull session, attempting to prove heroic enlightenment by forming agnostic conclusions.Martin Landau plays an ophthalmologist having an affair with a frantic, aging stewardess threatening to disrupt his affluent contentment by confronting his wife. Not deriving solace from a kindly Rabbi patient and friend who is facing blindness and recommends honesty, Landau solicits help from his criminal brother to solve the problem with a hired killer. His bouts of conscience include reminiscing moral debates at a family Seder during his adolescence. His father, favoring a morally sensible existence, argues with a nihilistic aunt who trivializes the bible, believes God's non-existence is proven by The Holocaust, and views morality as a social contrivance.Allen plays an uncompromising documentarian falling in love with an assistant (Farrow), also pursued by his boorish brother-in-law (Alda) who produces sitcoms and relishes being perceived as a creative genius. Alda's deep thoughts include the idea that with enough passage of time, tragedy becomes laughable, believing the Lincoln assassination to be an example. Alda throws his in-law a bone by allowing him to film him at work when Allen would rather work on a portrayal of a humanistic philosopher pondering serious questions. Unlike Landau's cynical aunt, the philosopher believes an empty universe is given meaning when human beings define values for themselves.Allen's likable character turns the documentary of Alda into a satire of the man's vanity, and we gain sympathy for his protectiveness towards a favorite niece. Shielding her proves futile as Allen learns of the philosopher's suicide while on an outing with her. At a wedding reception, Allen discovers he has lost his battle for Farrow's affections to the egotist and then engages in a chance colloquy with Landau, wistful over the fading of his conscience. Allen's sadness invites us to share a resignation over the capriciousness of fate, the success of obnoxious people, the joyless end of an unmourned mistress, the unrequited love of a sensitive man, a sweet woman taken in by a cad, the blindness of a benevolent Rabbi, the despair of a man of apparent wisdom, and the return to comfort by a philanderer and murderer all serving to portray God as incompetent because life is unpredictable and joy and suffering are not proportionate to decency or malice. The answers of religion must be contrivances.However, it requires contrivances to view God as a fool. Extreme skepticism often ignores contrary evidence to its cosmic-accident interpretation of existence. If we are just &quot;a pack of neurons&quot; and our mental life nothing but electrical impulses, then we cannot explain the realm of abstract concepts, including those of science. Nor can we explain the human mind's openness to truth, the foundation of all thought. Atheists cannot explain why anything should go right, even observation and deduction, why good logic should not be as misleading as bad logic, if they are both chance movements in the brain of a bewildered ape. Atheists exalt reason, but they cannot account for reason. Neither can materialism account for consciousness, free will, value judgments, and the existence of a unitary self. In a material world such things cannot exist. Matter cannot be free or have a self. Neither could free will exist if joy and suffering existed in perfect proportion with virtue and malice reducing our functionality to stimulus-response reward-punishment contingencies like that of lab rats pursuing a piece of cheese. Love and courage could not exist.Similarly, no matter how we claim to be nonjudgmental and deny innate moral truth, we can not ignore the countering evidence of our own anger, which reminds us that there are natural expectations we have, should have, and can not avoid having of each other. Anger is the existential expression of moral outrage even when we exercise moral outrage at the very concept of moral outrage, reflexively calling anyone presenting a moral vision a hypocrite. In our sober moments, we know the life of the desperate woman is as sacred as the successful doctor. Nonetheless, we often live with the temptation to defer to ""important people,"" hoping the identification of an imaginary human genius will confer a sense of superiority on ourselves by our presumed courage in recognizing theirs. We are quick to excuse the transgressions of genius. Morality can not be enough for great minds if they represent insights that anyone can have. Allen is a brilliant satirist of human pretense, often portraying trendy sophisticates as fools, but just as often sides with their elitist conventions that view metaphysical and moral questions as hopelessly complex needing great minds to sort it out for the rest of us. The last advice from Allen's philosopher is to hope for some genius of the future to give us life's meaning, although in the interim loving our families provides meaningful hope.But since a benevolent creator implies the universal nature of important truth, the fading of conscience does not really occur so easily, and an ethical sense is innate to human decency. The killing of a man of noble purpose is still a tragedy 140 years later. So is the killing of a lonely mistress. A God with the wisdom to be subtle also invites us to find meaning in loving our families, which is precisely what we don't do when we exercise a blind faith in our self-definition. Self-worship is closer to the definition of evil. It may be that we prefer to ignore evidence that God is not idiotic because it helps us to avoid realizing that we often are. Why impeach our failures of decency if God is in no position to judge us negatively if we don't? Fortunately, as our better, God is merciful in judging our mendacity, our failures, and our acts of desperation. There is a vast body of literature examining theodicy, unfortunately most written by humble people whom intellectuals never notice.",3,God Is Not An Idiot,1078876800,"03 10,

Allen's movies have more than extreme close-ups of exquisitely sensitive people enduring the torture of being oh-so-aware.  for example, they have sparkling dialogue and an interesting plot.Crimes and Misdemeanors, Allen's most mature work, addresses the eternal question plaguing the liberal psyche:  is life nothing more than maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain?  if so, what?  and, how can we know?  needless to say, Allen doesn't carve easy answers into tablets of stone; instead, he weaves a mandala-patterned tapestry.an ophthalmologist (Martin Landau) is treating a rabbi who is going blind.  the rabbi is a thoroughly decent man who is hoping to still be able to dance with his daughter at her upcoming wedding.  the ophthalmologist is planning to have his mistress (Angelica Houston) killed because she is threatening to expose him to his wife, the IRS, etc.  the rabbi winds up blind; the ophthalmologist winds up receiving an award for professional virtue.meanwhile, a failed documentary maker (played by Allen himself) meets a film editor (Mia Farrow).  though he is already married, they find each other perfectly in tune (heh, heh).  however, she deflects his amorous attentions in favor of a grossly insensitive, egomaniacal, shallow, intellectually pretentious film producer (Alan Alda) -- who can do wonders for her career.Allen's character has been trying to finish a documentary about a psychologist/philosopher/Holocaust-survivor who counsels people that, no matter what, life *does* have meaning beyond the pleasure/pain principle.  things don't work out too well for him, either.  and, Allen's character, playing someone exactly like himself (*except*, without the big time career), winds up all alone in the end -- his 'loveability quotient' notwithstanding.

Its humor is razor sharp and sparkling and the best and funniest Woody's one-liners and comic performances belong here. As always in his best films, Allen had created a clever and elegant film out of his own weaknesses and insecurities and it shines. How much was Allen able to meditate on life, death, God, religion, morality, crimes and the responsibility, love and lust, happiness and the price one pays for it, and among those eternal subjects - how much fun it is to skip work or school and to sneak to the movies.It is universal.

He focuses with the avidness of an entomologist in the intimate life of a famous and distinguished doctor who carries an apparent and normal life who makes a tearful speech about the God eyes but that finally the moral lessons learnt in his youth perhaps, were not enough. He presents a double life, a double moral; he is adultery and this adjective doesn't derive precisely of the word adult: he has lived a marriage through twenty years and suddenly meets a furtive, lonely and desperately lone woman Angelica Huston. He brings her back the joy for life but the things seem to be out of his control. She simply does not want to live in this way and additionally he has his hand something dirty with the administration of certain money . In the other hand we have a terrible selfish man who hires to Woody for a special documental where he will expose essentially all the concerns that have beaten Allen through his life. There will be sharp reflections about religion, art, philosophical issues. As always Woody is an irreverent and shy outlaw man who works as a journalist dealing with toxic products; as you can remember Chernobyl affair was still very fresh in the collective memory.Allen will establish wonderful bits of films that will match exactly with the progressive drama; he twill try to win the love of Mia Farrow deeply fascinated by this hyper selfish : Schubert in Manhattan works out perfectly when Allen walks under a bridge with the camera moving around him and Huston; as you know we are talking about the Death and the Maiden.These are basically the dramatic nucleus in this interweaved drama; this doctor will be object of blackmail by his mistress and decides to hire a mercenary to solve the disturbing situation. But do not worry, this puzzle is not unique in NYC. We have hundred and thousand similar cases where the public behavior must prevail above the minor issues, and the impunity is just a mere formalism that will be forgotten in the next party perhaps? Lampedusa's echoes still resound even in Manhattan: all must change for getting all keeps equal. My moral must be the same for my reputation and my secure place in this enormous stage, in this multidisciplinary complicity that it must work as a perfect clock mechanism: with the required pulse of a doctor with a laser eliminating a malign tumor: no pain, no complaints and then depending of your private religion there will be always a remote escape, the confession or the Complaint Wall .As wisely answered Northrop Frye when was asked about his personal opinion about the faith: ""The faith proves that the desperation is not the only solution"".One of my top choices Woody 's pictures",5,Something smells rotten in Manhattan!,1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,2724,"['one', 'Allen', 'most', 'heavy', 'weight', 'films', 'avidness', 'entomologist', 'intimate', 'life', 'famous', 'distinguished', 'doctor', 'who', 'apparent', 'normal', 'life', 'who', 'tearful', 'speech', 'God', 'eyes', 'finally', 'moral', 'lessons', 'learnt', 'youth', 'perhaps', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'double', 'life', 'double', 'moral', 'adultery', 'adjective', ""n't"", 'derive', 'precisely', 'word', 'adult', 'lived', 'marriage', 'twenty', 'years', 'suddenly', 'furtive', 'lonely', 'desperately', 'lone', 'woman', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'back', 'joy', 'life', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'control', 'simply', 'not', 'want', 'live', 'way', 'additionally', 'hand', 'something', 'dirty', 'administration', 'certain', 'money', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'terrible', 'selfish', 'man', 'who', 'Woody', 'special', 'documental', 'where', 'will', 'expose', 'essentially', 'concerns', 'have', 'beaten', 'Allen', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'sharp', 'reflections', 'religion', 'art', 'philosophical', 'issues', 'always', 'Woody', 'irreverent', 'shy', 'outlaw', 'man', 'who', 'journalist', 'dealing', 'toxic', 'products', 'can', 'remember', 'Chernobyl', 'affair', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'fresh', 'collective', 'memory.Allen', 'will', 'establish', 'wonderful', 'bits', 'films', 'will', 'match', 'exactly', 'progressive', 'drama', 'try', 'win', 'love', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'deeply', 'fascinated', 'hyper', 'selfish', 'Schubert', 'Manhattan', 'out', 'perfectly', 'when', 'Allen', 'bridge', 'camera', 'moving', 'Huston', 'know', 'are', 'talking', 'Death', 'Maiden.These', 'are', 'basically', 'dramatic', 'nucleus', 'interweaved', 'drama', 'doctor', 'will', 'be', 'object', 'blackmail', 'mistress', 'decides', 'hire', 'mercenary', 'solve', 'disturbing', 'situation', 'do', 'not', 'worry', 'puzzle', 'not', 'unique', 'NYC', 'have', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'similar', 'cases', 'where', 'public', 'behavior', 'must', 'prevail', 'minor', 'issues', 'impunity', 'just', 'mere', 'formalism', 'will', 'be', 'forgotten', 'next', 'party', 'perhaps', 'Lampedusa', 'echoes', 'still', 'resound', 'even', 'Manhattan', 'must', 'change', 'getting', 'keeps', 'equal', 'moral', 'must', 'be', 'same', 'reputation', 'secure', 'place', 'enormous', 'stage', 'multidisciplinary', 'complicity', 'must', 'work', 'perfect', 'clock', 'mechanism', 'required', 'pulse', 'doctor', 'laser', 'eliminating', 'malign', 'tumor', 'pain', 'complaints', 'then', 'depending', 'private', 'religion', 'will', 'be', 'always', 'remote', 'escape', 'confession', 'Complaint', 'Wall', '.As', 'wisely', 'answered', 'Northrop', 'Frye', 'when', 'was', 'asked', 'personal', 'opinion', 'faith', 'faith', 'desperation', 'not', 'only', 'solution', '.One', 'top', 'choices', 'Woody', 'pictures']",N/A

446230,A192KEPM0HW6AC,6305075328,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[23, 28]","Woody Allen is the most deeply religious of movie directors; He just doesn't know it yet.""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" (an obvious nod to Fyodor Dostoyevsky) is Allen's most engrossing quest for moral order in the universe, which quest leaves him -- and the viewer -- utterly bereft.However, unlike the bleak ""Interiors"" or Allen's hilarious send-up on impending death being the impetus for finding God in ""Hannah and Her Sisters,"" Allen's treatment of God, morality and free will is multi-faceted, and doesn't come to any pat answers.In fact, it is Allen's ambivalent contemplation of religion and ethics that conservative critics find lacking at best, or disingenuous at worst.  I see it differently:  Agree or disagree with him, Allen is an atheist who is nonetheless tormented by the conclusion he has reached that there is no God.  His is no knee-jerk atheism, as he has clearly thought through the philosophical issues involved, wavering between Nietzschean will to power and outright denial, to existentialist reluctance in the face of the ultimate meaningless of life beyond the here-and-now.""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is peopled by a sterling cast, whose lives and choices are in direct conflict and contrast with one another; Yet, all speak with one voice, in Allen's exquisitely economical and pointed dialogue.Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau, in the role of a lifetime, so perfectly is the dialogue tailored to his cadence of voice and gestures), like Job, is a man who has everything he could ever want.  Unlike Job, when he sees his wealth and seemingly ideal family life (with wife Claire Bloom) jeopardized, he turns his back on God.The catalyst for Judah's life crisis is Dolores (Angelica Huston), a lonely airline stewardress with whom he's having more than a fling. When Dolores realises that she means nothing more to Judah than a mistress, and that his marital overtures to her were hollow, she turns on him with neurotic vengeance, threatening to expose not only their affair, but Judah's shady financial dealings.Frozen by fear of exposure, Judah turns to his rabbi (played by Sam Waterston) for advice.  As wise as the advice is, it leaves too much to chance, that Judah can still indeed face exposure, shame and ruin.  So, then he calls on his hit-man brother (Jerry Orbach) to quietly make Dolores -- and all Judah's problems -- disappear.And they *do* disappear, but with one hitch:  Judah is suddenly consumed with guilt, and the one distant God now appears to haunt him and watch his every move.  It is interesting watching Judah as he tries to reconcile his amoral crime with his ambivalent beliefs towards the Almighty.  The scene in which he visits his childhood home in New Jersey brings back ghosts from his past, and we see his relatives sitting around the Seder table, in heated debate over the existence of God and the search for a moral order in the universe.  Being a Woody Allen movie, of course the nasal aunt who dismisses God as a childish fantasy --  given the evidence that He did nothing to stop the Holocaust -- wins the day, thus influencing the adolescent Judah, who is being watched by the older Judah, an invisible prescence within the dining room.Two other plot threads run alternately hilarious/serious:  Allen co-stars as Clifford Stern, an independent filmmaker, who lives on the financial and emotional handouts from his sexually barren wife.  When she arranges for him to film the life of her brother, Lester, a successful commercial TV producer played by Alan Alda (whose sleazy character is a cross between Norman Lear and Ted Turner), Clifford bristles at Lester's shallowness.  Things get wilder as Cliff tries to woo Halley (played by Mia Farrow), a public TV producer.  Meanwhile, Halley -- who at first brushes off Lester's slick advances -- starts being attracted to Lester.Meanwhile, Clifford is filming the life story of a philosopher of positive thinking, Holocaust survivor Dr. Levy.  When the professor turns negative and commits suicide (and Halley simultaneously throws Cliff over for the boorish Lester), Clifford concludes that there is nothing but random moral choas, and that indeed -- echoing Nietzsche -- God is dead.The movie ends with Clifford and Judah meeting at the wedding of Rabbi Ben's daughter.  The Rabbi has now gone fully blind, despite Judah's attempts to restore his eyesight.  Yet, Judah observes, the guilt over Dolores' murder have dissipated, and confides hypothetically to Clifford that life can indeed be good for a murderer, provided he feel no moral guilt for his crimes, and that morality is but an impediment to fruitful living.  After all, he notes, his family life and fortune have been restored to him, and that the idea of retributive justice being doled out by God is a fairy tale, a figment of imagination.The conclusion is that we are each responsible for our own actions and our own lives.  Yet, Allen makes one huge error in logic:  If there is no God, he seems to imply, and if there is no moral order to the universe, then there is no moral or ethical impediment to murdering one's fellows.  Is this Allen's tacit acknowledgement of the supernatural, or is he backing up Nietzsche's notion that morality was only invented to keep lesser men from running amok, that the common mass needs laws because they are incapable of rational judgment?  It seems here that Allen is making the case for utter nihilism.  So, why is he a liberal on the political spectrum, liberalism being a philosophy that holds democratic action and altruism as its moral center?  Is Allen making a sotto voce case for fascism?Truthfully, I don't think he's doing the latter.  Nonetheless, it is refreshing to see an atheist give so much thought and obvious private anguish to the question of God.  If only the faithful did, there'd be less wanton violence commited in His name.",5,Is Woody Religious?,1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,5857,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'most', 'deeply', 'religious', 'movie',

I've only seen 3 Woody Allen films (not counting Match Point) that came out after C&M; and before MP, but I'd have to agree. Crimes & Misdemeanors is a film that ranks right up there with Allen's greatest work. Films like The Purple Rose of Cairo and Annie Hall.It's a perfect blend of drama and comedy. In fact, Match Point was kind of a retread of this film. The drama without the comedy. This movie stars Martin Landau ('Ed Wood') as Judah Rosenthal, an eye-doctor (I don't remember the term for one) who's been having an affair with a woman named Dolores (Anjelica Huston, 'Buffalo 66'). Problem is, he's tried to break it off but Dolores isn't having it. She's, instead, threatened to expose his infidelity to his wife. He's barely intercepted the letters. He looks to a patient, a rabbi (Sam Waterston, 'The Killing Fields'), for help...But it's not working. When he turns to his mobster brother Jack (Jerry Orbach, 'Law & Order') for help. Jack suggests murder. Judah reluctantly gives in. Meanwhile, a filmmaker named Cliff Stern (Allen) is tapped by his brother-in-law Lester (Alan Alda,'Mahattan Murder Mystery') to make a documentary special on him. Cliff hates Lester, but isn't getting work anywhere else. While working on it, Cliff meets Halley Reed (Mia Farrow, 'Rosemary's Baby') whom he falls for, despite being married. In typical Woody Allen style, the film is fueled mostly by conversations between the main characters. I liked his ploy of showing clips of old movies (as a character was watching them) that kind of went over what was occurring in his own movie. The movie is separated into comedy and drama, kind of like Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda."" The drama part is the Judah plot. The comedy is the Cliff plot. Although both of them drift into the other category occasionally. They both finally come together at the end. The movie simultaneously reminded me of Match Point and Manhattan. The former for obvious reasons, the latter because the endings are similar in what happens to Allen's character. Anyway, the acting is great of course. As is the dialogue, as always. There's a lot of great one-liners (""I haven't been inside a woman since I visited the statue of Liberty"") and some physical bits of humor as well.

446235,A2DJWC249EEUEH,6305075328,"Karen Braman ""HorrorGal82""","[1, 1]","One of the greatest dilemmas a director can face is making a likable, relatable film when nearly all the characters presented are thoroughly unlikable. This is one of the dilemmas Woody Allen faces with his film Crimes and Misdemeanors. Let's take a look at the main hero of the film. Here is a man, Judah, in an unhappy marriage caring on with another woman for over two years who decides it's time to kill her off before she releases his secret to his wife.How can such a man be presented as likable? Well, Woody Allen's best decision is to make him an everyman. A man caught up in the situation in which he must face his demons head on. He has made a mistake and he must deal with the consequences of such mistake. In an ordinary Hollywood film, this would mean him being caught and forced to pay for the crime that he has committed. Such is not the case here. Sure he has some regret but, by facing and admitting to what he has done, he is able to move on with his life. One of the great strengths of this film is that it doesn't shy away from what Judah has done. It doesn't make light of it and it doesn't deny that it has happen.He is simply a man who has made this mistake and is forced to go on with his life carrying this horrible mistake. Should he have gone to jail? You bet. Should he have told his wife about his adultery? Of course. But, that is not how life works. We live in a world where we don't always get what is coming to us. Great things happen to bad people everyday and vice versa. I don't believe this makes a bad guy, just a realistic one. By crafting a movie with a central character with real flaws, Woody Allen has created a movie of uncommon power. Four days after seeing it, I still can't get it out of my head.

Contemporary social life corrupts ethics - that's the theme of the film and  it's masterly done.

446237,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,6305075328,Kerry Walters,"[5, 5]","Allen has said on more than one occasion that he doesn't have the stuff to be a director/writer of the caliber of Bergman or Fellini.  But in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" he comes up to the task.  The film isn't just one of Allen's best (I'm comfortable with saying it's the very best he's ever made, except for the fact that, because Allen works in at least three genres, it's difficult to compare and contrast his films).  In my judgment, it's one of the finest films in American cinema.The film is really cut from the same cloth as the medieval passion play.  It explores themes that involve morality and God.  In a godless universe, does it make any sense to talk about right or wrong?  In a universe in which there might be a god, but one who's apparently indifferent to us, are we free to act as we wish?  Allen's conclusion seems to be not unlike Albert Camus' in The Myth of Sisyphus:  the universe may or may not be godless, but it is absurd.  Bad guys (as personified by Martin Landau's character) do what they do without apparent retribution or punishment, but may not be easy with their gains.  Good guys (as personified by Woody Allen's character) do what they do without apparent reward or acclaim, and may be just as uneasy.  Most of us are simply too self-absorbed and witless (Alan Alda's character) to know that, in the end, everybody loses.A bleak image of human existence, perhaps.  But (as in Bergman's worldview), it's lightened by fleeting moments of grace:  falling in love, moments of wonderment and happiness, relating to young people.  We all may be losers in the end, but that needn't make life totally miserable.Performances in the film, especially Alan Alda's and Martin Landau's, are superb.  The only exception is Angelica Huston's wooden performance.  But insofar as she's got to be one of the most overrated actors in the business, one doesn't expect more from her, and thus is never really disappointed.Easily five stars.",5,"Heads you win, tails I lose",1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,1953,"['Allen', 'said', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', ""n't"", 'have', 'stuff', 'be', 'director/writer', 'caliber', 'Bergman', 'Fellini', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'up', 'task', 'film', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'Allen', 'best', ""'m"", 'comfortable', 'saying', 'very', 'best', 'ever', 'made', 'fact', 'Allen', 'least', 'three', 'genres', 'difficult', 'compare', 'contrast', 'films', 'judgment', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'American', 'cinema.The', 'film', 'really', 'cut', 'same', 'cloth', 'medieval', 'passion', 'play', 'themes', 'involve', 'morality', 'God', 'godless', 'universe', 'make', 'sense', 'talk', 'right', 'wrong', 'universe', 'might', 'be', 'god', 'one', 'who', 'apparently', 'indifferent', 'are', 'free', 'act', 'wish', 'Allen', 'conclusion', 'be', 'not', 'Albert', 'Camus', 'Myth', 'Sisyphus', 'universe', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'godless', 'absurd', 'Bad', 'guys', 'personified', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'character', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'apparent', 'retribution', 'punishment', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'gains', 'Good', 'guys', 'personified', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'apparent', 'reward', 'acclaim', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'uneasy', 'Most', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'self-absorbed', 'witless', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'character', 'know', 'end', 'everybody', 'loses.A', 'bleak', 'image', 'human', 'existence', 'perhaps', 'Bergman', 'worldview', 'lightened', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'grace', 'falling', 'love', 'moments', 'wonderment', 'happiness', 'relating', 'young', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'losers', 'end', 'need', ""n't"", 'make', 'life', 'totally', 'miserable.Performances', 'film', 'especially', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'are', 'superb', 'only', 'exception', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'wooden', 'performance', 'insofar', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'overrated', 'actors', 'business', 'one', ""n't"", 'expect', 'more', 'thus', 'never', 'really', 'disappointed.Easily', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

I suggest watching this movie on a Saturday afternoon with a friend or group of people, and then going out for coffee to discuss it.  It's one of those rare movies that raises so many questions that are just waiting to be talked about.Woody Allen has always made us laugh, and it's unfortunate that his more dramatic features, such as ""Interiors"" aren't more popular.  Fortunately, he combines his wit with his wisdom in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors.""This movie is more like two short films combined to make one film.  There are two plots, and the two protagonists meet in the end.  In one, there's the typical light Woody fare with Woody playing an unsuccessful documentary filmmaker who is coerced into making a film about his obnoxious brother-in-law, a tv show producer.  He falls in love with an executive producer, which would be fine except for two things: 1.)she doesn't feel the same way, and 2)he's married.The other, more dramatic story deals with Judah Rosenthal, a successful opthmalogist , philanthropist, and family man who has a secret: he had an affair with another woman.  He borke it off, but now the woman has threatened to tell his wife and others about his infedelity and other deeds.  he speaks to a rabbi client (also Woody's brother-in-law), who says that he needs to tell his wife in order to free himself.  He also talks to his brother.  His solution?  Have her killed.The acting is absolutely riveting.  Martin Landau is terrific as a tormented man who cannot choose between his morals and the life he leads.  And Anjelica Huston is incredible as a woman pushed to the edge.  The rest of the cast shines as well.  Allen always has creative casting and it always seems to work.I cannot tell you how this movie gets into your psyche.  At one point, the rabbi tells Judah, ""It's a human life.  You don't think God sees?""  Judah's reply, ""God is a luxury I can't afford.""  Wow.  Who do we sympathize with?  The man who is guilt ridden, or the woman he strung along for two years?  The man who's in love with a woman, or his wife?  Allen never forces us to choose.My favorite scene is a flashback scene with Judah's family.  The family is at a seder (passover) dinner, and is talking about God.  This scene in particular raises such fantastic theological questions:  If we, as humans, get away with something bad that we did on earth, are we still punished in the afterlife?  Does one have to choose between God and the truth?  What would you choose?",5,Wow.

I just watched it again last night, and found it was more haunting, funny, and terrifying than ever. It makes you wonder if Woody has something dark to hide. If so, does he see the same Godless empty universe that the lead character comes to embrace? While very funny in places, make no mistake: this is a horror movie. People can and do get away with murder. This film gives no glory to the atheist or agnostic. In fact, the characters with faith and belief in a moral structure are the most endearing and resonant. I was moved to watch the blind rabbi dancing with his daughter. In the end, I didn't care much for Allen's and Landau's characters at all. One was a whiny nebbish, and the other is a heartless murderer who chose to commit an evil act out of convenience. Critics dismiss this film as some kind of bittersweet black comedy with philosophical pretensions. When in fact, it is a horror story. Martin Landau's opthamologist is a far more frightening character than Clint Eastwood's drunk gunslinger in Unforgiven. Clint's Will Munny shoots bad guys with pistols in a drunken rage. Landau's Judah is sober and contemplative as he arranges the death of an innocent woman who only wanted to be acknowledged, and loved, and to reveal the truth. I find Crimes and Misdemeanors a more terrifying film than The Shining. In light of the recently revived accusations of Mr. Allen's possible sexual abuse of a minor, this film is even more disturbing. A fictional opthamologist gets away with murder.

It is a meaty, complex film with interesting, fine-tuned characters and provoking relationships.  Many topics are examined including infidelity, murder, God and religion, moral rules of the universe, comedy, adultery and tragic situations.Cliff Stern (Woody Allen) is a struggling documentary filmmaker in a marriage that has becoming boring and meaningless.  His wife asks her brother, Lester (Alan Alda) a successful comedy star to give Cliff a job so they have income to live on.  In the meantime we see Martin Landau playing a successful ophthalmologist, Judah Rosenthal, who is having an affair with a former airline stewardess, Dolores (Anjelica Huston), who loves him deeply and is threatening to go to Judah's wife and discuss the relationship.  She wants Judah for herself and he may have made promises to her he cannot keep.  He is deeply troubled and discusses his sin to Ben (Sam Waterston, a patient and learned rabbi who is losing his eyesight but not his faith.  Ben recommends Judah tell his wife and ask forgiveness.  The relationship may change but the truth and forgiveness is the moral way out.  Judah cannot hurt his wife of 25 years and turns to his brother Jack, a man of the underworld, connected to the mob and can make things ""happen"" - in this case, get rid of Dolores who is also threatening to blackmail Judah on some fund movements between stocks and foundation monies she knows about.In separate scenes Cliff is continuing making the documentary about his pompous brother-in-law, Lester, and they are both falling for the film's producer (Halle Reed (Mia Farrow).  Even though Cliff is married, he is not happy and lets Hallie know his feelings for her.  Lester is also a ""ladies man"" and is shown flirting with starlets after hours.  He has a very high opinion of himself, and Cliff struggles with his failures and hopes.  His other project involved a professor speaking on the joys of humankind, happiness and optimism.  Ironically, Lester learns his ""star"" has committed suicide so he has to ""shelve"" his one hopeful dream project.Overall ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is a mature look at the complex rules of morality and what how each individual frames their actions, and how ""chance"" plays in the game.  One line mentioned during a Jewish Sedar was that ""If Hitler won the war, history books would have been written much differently.""",4,Mature Look at the Thin Line of Morality -,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,2438,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'directs', 'produces', 'stars', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'meaty', 'complex', 'film', 'interesting', 'fine-tuned', 'characters', 'provoking', 'relationships', 'Many', 'topics', 'are', 'examined', 'including', 'infidelity', 'murder', 'God', 'religion', 'moral', 'rules', 'universe', 'comedy', 'adultery', 'tragic', 'situations.Cliff', 'Stern', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'struggling', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'marriage', 'becoming', 'boring', 'meaningless', 'wife', 'brother', 'Lester', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'successful', 'comedy', 'star', 'give', 'Cliff', 'job', 'have', 'income', 'live', 'meantime', 'see', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'playing', 'successful', 'ophthalmologist', 'Judah', 'Rosenthal', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'former', 'airline', 'stewardess', 'Dolores', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'who', 'deeply', 'threatening', 'go', 'Judah', 'wife', 'discuss', 'relationship', 'Judah', 'herself', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'promises', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'sin', 'Ben', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'patient', 'learned', 'rabbi', 'who', 'losing', 'eyesight', 'not', 'faith', 'Ben', 'Judah', 'tell', 'wife', 'ask', 'forgiveness', 'relationship', 'may', 'change', 'truth', 'forgiveness', 'moral', 'way', 'Judah', 'can', 'not', 'hurt', 'wife', '25', 'years', 'brother', 'Jack', 'man', 'underworld', 'connected', 'mob', 'can', 'make', 'things', 'happen', 'case', 'get', 'rid', 'Dolores', 'who', 'also', 'threatening', 'blackmail', 'Judah', 'fund', 'movements', 'stocks', 'foundation', 'monies', 'about.In', 'separate', 'scenes', 'Cliff', 'continuing', 'making', 'documentary', 'pompous', 'brother-in-law', 'Lester', 'are', 'falling', 'film', 'producer', 'Halle', 'Reed', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Even', 'Cliff', 'married', 'not', 'happy', 'Hallie', 'know', 'feelings', 'Lester', 'also', 'ladies', 'man', 'shown', 'flirting', 'starlets', 'hours', 'very', 'high', 'opinion', 'Cliff', 'failures', 'hopes', 'other', 'project', 'involved', 'professor', 'speaking', 'joys', 'humankind', 'happiness', 'optimism', 'Ironically', 'Lester', 'star', 'committed', 'suicide', 'so', 'shelve', 'one', 'hopeful', 'dream', 'project.Overall', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'mature', 'look', 'complex', 'rules', 'morality', 'what', 'how', 'individual', 'frames', 'actions', 'how', 'chance', 'plays', 'game', 'One', 'line', 'mentioned', 'Jewish', 'Sedar', 'was', 'Hitler', 'won', 'war', 'history', 'books', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'much', 'differently']",N/A

446244,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,6305075328,Michael Crane,"[0, 1]","Love him or hate him, it's very hard to deny the fact that Woody Allen is extremely talented when it comes to making films and comedy.  Yes, the real Woody Allen has issues and problems, but I am able to enjoy Woody Allen as a brilliant filmmaker with a very impressive body of work.  ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" was a complete surprise for me.  It's a darker and more serious picture from Allen, but there's still enough comedy that feels real and not forced.The film focuses on two main characters.  The first is a successful ophthalmologist, Judah, who has a loving wife and family.  He seems to have it all, but his prosperous and rich life is threatened when his mistress is fed up with not being able to have all of Judah to herself and wants to come clean to his wife.  Judah has no idea what to do, and since he can't buy her off or talk her out of it, he goes to his criminal brother for advice.  When he suggests that she can be ""gotten rid of,"" Judah is faced with a serious choice to make and must consider the consequences.  The second part of the story involves a very idealistic and artsy filmmaker, Cliff.  In order to make the philosophical and human inspirited documentary he has planned, he has to stoop down to making a film centered around a goofy sitcom producer who he despises, just so Cliff can finance the project.These two stories are very different from each other, and at first you start to wonder what the significance is.  It is true that Judah's story is much more captivating, but we also need the Cliff story as this is a movie that is about tough choices, and it examines if somebody can live with the decisions they make, no matter how small or major they may be.  I will also say this much; this is a film that requires multiple viewings, because this film will most likely take you by surprise.  I would call this more of a drama than a comedy, but there are a lot of comedic touches to it as well.  The writing and directing from Allen is top notch, and this could be one of his most complex films.  The cast is also terrific with a lot of big names, and none of them disappoint.What I really enjoy about this movie is that all of the characters are fully fleshed out.  Nobody seems flat and no matter how flawed somebody may appear, you can still see traces, if not more, of humanity within them somehow.  That to me makes the movie even more chilling and dark at times.  These aren't goofy cartoon characters where you know from the start who's good and who's rotten to the core.  These people come off as being real, and that's a talent Allen has when it comes to making films that aren't so slapstick, and this is an important key that makes ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" work in the end.  The characters have real problems and obstacles, and they have to decide in the end, when the smoke is clear, if they can live with themselves with the choices they have made. -Michael Crane",5,"""We define ourselves by the choices we have made...""",1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,2917,"['Love', 'hate', 'very', 'hard', 'deny', 'fact', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'extremely', 'talented', 'when', 'making', 'films', 'comedy', 'Yes', 'real', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'issues', 'problems', 'am', 'able', 'enjoy', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'brilliant', 'filmmaker', 'very', 'impressive', 'body', 'work', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'was', 'complete', 'surprise', 'darker', 'more', 'serious', 'picture', 'Allen', 'still', 'enough', 'comedy', 'feels', 'real', 'not', 'forced.The', 'film', 'focuses', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'first', 'successful', 'ophthalmologist', 'Judah', 'who', 'loving', 'wife', 'family', 'have', 'prosperous', 'rich', 'life', 'threatened', 'when', 'mistress', 'fed', 'up', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'have', 'Judah', 'herself', 'come', 'clean', 'wife', 'Judah', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'off', 'talk', 'criminal', 'brother', 'advice', 'When', 'can', 'be', 'gotten', 'rid', 'Judah', 'faced', 'serious', 'choice', 'make', 'must', 'consider', 'consequences', 'second', 'part', 'story', 'very', 'idealistic', 'artsy', 'filmmaker', 'Cliff', 'order', 'make', 'philosophical', 'human', 'inspirited', 'documentary', 'planned', 'stoop', 'down', 'making', 'film', 'centered', 'goofy', 'sitcom', 'producer', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'Cliff', 'can', 'finance', 'project.These', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'first', 'start', 'wonder', 'what', 'significance', 'true', 'Judah', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'captivating', 'also', 'need', 'Cliff', 'story', 'movie', 'tough', 'choices', 'somebody', 'can', 'live', 'decisions', 'make', 'matter', 'how', 'small', 'major', 'may', 'be', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'much', 'film', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'film', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'take', 'surprise', 'would', 'call', 'more', 'drama', 'comedy', 'are', 'lot', 'comedic', 'touches', 'as', 'well', 'writing', 'directing', 'Allen', 'top', 'notch', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'complex', 'films', 'cast', 'also', 'terrific', 'lot', 'big', 'names', 'none', 'disappoint.What', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Nobody', 'flat', 'matter', 'how', 'flawed', 'somebody', 'may', 'appear', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'traces', 'not', 'more', 'humanity', 'somehow', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'chilling', 'dark', 'times', 'are', ""n't"", 'goofy', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'where', 'know', 'start', 'who', 'good', 'who', 'rotten', 'core', 'people', 'come', 'off', 'being', 'real', 'talent', 'Allen', 'when', 'making', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'slapstick', 'important', 'key', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'work', 'end', 'characters', 'have', 'real', 'problems', 'obstacles', 'have', 'decide', 'end', 'when', 'smoke', 'clear', 'can', 'live', 'choices', 'have', 'made', '-Michael', 'Crane']",N/A
446245,A3FVF3T2HKQES7,6305075328,"MICHAEL STODGHILL ""FILM COLLECTOR""","[1, 1]","In his nearly fifty year film career, Woody Allen has made some of the best films(&#34;Annie Hall&#34;, &#34;Manhattan&#34;, &#34;Hannah and Her Sisters&#34;) of any writer/director that continues to this day(&#34;Midnight in Paris&#34;, &#34;Blue Jasmine&#34;). Those films have covered a wide variety of topics and featured an interesting collection of characters. That can certainly be said of &#34;Crimes and Misdemeanors&#34;(1989) the film that closed out Allen's prolific Eighties period(directing eleven films). Twilight Time has now given this superb film a beautiful Blu-ray upgrade that should make fans of Allen want to have for their collection. It's a marked improvement over the Standard DVD release put out by MGM years ago with a nearly flawless video picture. The cinematography by Sven Nykvist(who worked with Bergman) is one of the highlights of the film and some of the images he creates look stunning on Blu-ray. The film's story line might not be to everyone's taste(self-inflicted punishments and guilt) but it's meaning certainly hasn't changed since it's debut in 1989.(Except the price of gas-check out the scene outside a Shell gas station where you can clearly see the Shell sign that has regular gas @ $1.03!!). Allen gets the best out of his actors with top nods going to Martin Landau and Anjelica Huston giving exceptional performances. The Audio(English 1.0 DTS-HD MA) is much improved from the Standard DVD too. &#34;Crimes and Misdemeanors&#34; is 104 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1) and only contains the following subtitle: (English SDH). Special features include only the theatrical trailer. Twilight Time limits their Blu-ray titles to only 3,000 units and many of their titles have already sold out. This is the first Woody Allen film that Twilight is bringing to Blu-ray with &#34;Broadway Danny Rose&#34; coming up next. Hopefully we'll see Blu-ray upgrades to some of his other films that he made for Orion Pictures in the Eighties(&#34;Hannah and Her Sisters&#34;, &#34;Radio Days&#34;) later this year.

446246,A27PSZX2SE0B51,6305075328,Mike Stone,"[0, 0]","Two stories run parallel to each other, destined to meet in the denouement.  Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau), a successful opthamologist, contemplates murdering his hysterical mistress (Angelica Huston).  On the flipside, Clifford Stern (Woody Allen) falls for Halley Reed (Mia Farrow), the woman producing a documentary he&#8217;s directing on his loathsome brother-in-law, a successful television producer (Alan Alda).  One narrative carries its inherent weight well.  Landau&#8217;s torment after the deed is done is palpable and painful.  The other narrative seems flighty by comparison.  Titular bad guy Alda shields himself from the daggers shot from Woody&#8217;s rolling eyes.  However, his only real sin is lechery.That being said, the two most heartbreaking moments in the film -- moments that rival in visceral emotion anything I&#8217;ve seen at the movies in some time -- come from the &#8220;flighty&#8221; narrative.  I wish I could tell you what they were, but that would spoil the surprise.  Just know that they are probably the most dramatic moments Woody Allen has ever put on film, as either director or -- and here&#8217;s the surprising part -- dramatic actor.  His work is low-key and subdued here, more so than I&#8217;ve ever seen it before.The rest of the cast is spotty at best.  Landau, who I rarely believe in his roles, comes close to completely pulling off his Judah, only he misses by a few steps.  One scene, where Judah exhibits poor judgement, had me astonished in my seat with disbelief.  Still, more commitment from Landau would have sold the scene better.  Mia Farrow gets some snappy one-liners as well as some tragic moments, but it feels like she&#8217;s forcing the issue in both respects.  Also, she has little to no chemistry with Woody (at least none that I saw on screen).  The best work is done by Alan Alda.  His role could have been an over-the-top parody (it nearly is), but Alda pulls the reigns back just enough.  His Lester isn&#8217;t really the bad man Cliff sees; he&#8217;s just a materialistic blowhard.  Nothing criminal about that.  Kudos to Alda for showing restraint, while sketching a living and breathing character.There are some truly funny moments that serve as comic relief to break up the tense drama.  Woody gets most of these, natch.  One memorable scene involves Cliff and Lester, in which Lester pauses from a conversation about Cliff filming his documentary.  He recites into a mini-taperecorder ideas about a TV farce in which a &#8220;loser&#8221; films a documentary on a successful man, and learns something in the process.  Cliff, standing right there the whole time, rolls his eyes in disbelief.  On paper, it may not come across how hearty a laugh this moment gets.The most fascinating aspect of the film was probably the discussions of morality and ethics.  God enters the picture once or twice (in discussion only), and man&#8217;s deeds are raked over the coals.  And even though it doesn&#8217;t provide the typical Hollywood movie answers, the answers the film does provide are realistic and true and, most importantly, tragic.

446250,A2GVM7RNS6ANZJ,6305075328,Paul Durgala,"[2, 2]","Having just recently viewed this film, I have to say that my appreciation of Woody Allen has grown tremendously.  I never realized how much of an artist he truly is.This film actually follows a similar pattern as the old greek plays and many of the more modern plays where you have a main plot that's more serious and cerebral, counterbalanced by a second plot that's a little more earthy and comical.  The main plot involves Judah, a successful opthomologist much beloved and respected by his family and friends, who ends up having his mistress murdered to prevent her from revealing their affair to his wife and friends.  The second plot involves Cliff, a struggling film-maker who is given the odious job of making a documentary of his boorish brother-in-law Lester, a successful TV producer.The first plot deals primarily with the shame and guilt that Judah has to endure, first over the extra-marital affair, and second, over the murder to cover up the affair.  Martin Landeau really does a brilliant job of bringing Judah's character to life.  We feel his stunned anguish when he says to his family ""I've just done a terrible thing"" and then making a quick recovery ""I left my notes at the office.""  Later, after the murder is commited, he visits his childhood home in New Jersey.  There he sees a flash back of his family gathered around the dinner table having their sader.  Judah's atheist aunt scolds his father, who's an orthodox jew, for filling the kids heads with a bunch of nonsense supersition.  There is no God.  There is no absolute moral framework.  We live in a world where might makes right, citing the murder of six million jews by the Nazis as an example.  Judah's father takes the opposite view that there is a righteous God who rewards the righteous and punishes the wicked either in this life or the next.  His aunt says that if a man can commit murder and not be troubled in conscience and not get caught, he's home free.  After a few months the murder is finally pinned falsely on someone else, Judah breathes a sigh of relief and gets on with his happy, successful life.The second plot with Cliff has a similar but not nearly as serious dilemma.  We feel sympathetic with Cliff and yet find ourselves more charismatically drawn to Lester.  In the end, Lester ends up getting his way in life while Cliff goes away penniless, with a broken marriage and no girlfriend.The moral in both of these plots is that life is not always fair, and that sometimes people treat others unfairly or do terrible things and get off scott free.I have to say although the film itself is very well done, I disagree with the conclusion.  If we operate from the premise that there is no God then certainly there is much in life that is cruel and unfair and is not brought to justice.  If on the other hand we operate from the premise that there is a righteous God who sees what we do the thought of facing His judgement is sobering if not downright troubling.  Even in Judah's case, it's doubtful that he got off scott free.  He was a good man and a man of conscience and he had to carry the guilt and shame of his terrible deed around for the rest of his life.  I've known cases where that alone drove people to the brink of insanity.Personally, I think the older plays, where the tragic character has to pay the price for his or her misdeeds is probably closer to the truth.",5,Woody's Finest,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,3381,"['Having', 'just', 'recently', 'viewed', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'appreciation', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'grown', 'tremendously', 'never', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'artist', 'truly', 'is.This', 'film', 'actually', 'similar', 'pattern', 'old', 'greek', 'plays', 'many', 'more', 'modern', 'plays', 'where', 'have', 'main', 'plot', 'more', 'serious', 'cerebral', 'counterbalanced', 'second', 'plot', 'little', 'more', 'earthy', 'comical', 'main', 'plot', 'Judah', 'successful', 'opthomologist', 'much', 'beloved', 'respected', 'family', 'friends', 'who', 'up', 'having', 'mistress', 'murdered', 'prevent', 'revealing', 'affair', 'wife', 'friends', 'second', 'plot', 'Cliff', 'struggling', 'film-maker', 'who', 'given', 'odious', 'job', 'making', 'documentary', 'boorish', 'brother-in-law', 'Lester', 'successful', 'TV', 'producer.The', 'first', 'plot', 'deals', 'primarily', 'shame', 'guilt', 'Judah', 'endure', 'first', 'extra-marital', 'affair', 'second', 'murder', 'cover', 'up', 'affair', 'Martin', 'Landeau', 'really', 'brilliant', 'job', 'bringing', 'Judah', 'character', 'life', 'feel', 'stunned', 'anguish', 'when', 'family', ""'ve"", 'just', 'done', 'terrible', 'thing', 'then', 'making', 'quick', 'recovery', 'left', 'notes', 'office', 'Later', 'murder', 'commited', 'childhood', 'home', 'New', 'Jersey', 'flash', 'back', 'family', 'gathered', 'dinner', 'table', 'having', 'sader', 'Judah', 'atheist', 'aunt', 'scolds', 'father', 'who', 'orthodox', 'jew', 'filling', 'kids', 'heads', 'bunch', 'nonsense', 'supersition', 'God', 'absolute', 'moral', 'framework', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'might', 'right', 'citing', 'murder', 'six', 'million', 'jews', 'Nazis', 'example', 'Judah', 'father', 'opposite', 'view', 'righteous', 'God', 'who', 'rewards', 'righteous', 'wicked', 'life', 'next', 'aunt', 'man', 'can', 'commit', 'murder', 'not', 'be', 'troubled', 'conscience', 'not', 'get', 'caught', 'home', 'free', 'few', 'months', 'murder', 'finally', 'pinned', 'falsely', 'someone', 'else', 'Judah', 'sigh', 'relief', 'happy', 'successful', 'life.The', 'second', 'plot', 'Cliff', 'similar', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'serious', 'dilemma', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'Cliff', 'yet', 'find', 'more', 'charismatically', 'drawn', 'Lester', 'end', 'Lester', 'up', 'getting', 'way', 'life', 'Cliff', 'away', 'penniless', 'broken', 'marriage', 'girlfriend.The', 'moral', 'plots', 'life', 'not', 'always', 'fair', 'sometimes', 'people', 'treat', 'others', 'unfairly', 'do', 'terrible', 'things', 'get', 'off', 'scott', 'free.I', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'disagree', 'conclusion', 'operate', 'premise', 'God', 'then', 'certainly', 'much', 'life', 'cruel', 'unfair', 'not', 'brought', 'justice', 'other', 'hand', 'operate', 'premise', 'righteous', 'God', 'who', 'what', 'do', 'thought', 'facing', 'judgement', 'sobering', 'not', 'downright', 'troubling', 'Even', 'Judah', 'case', 'doubtful', 'got', 'off', 'scott', 'free', 'was', 'good', 'man', 'man', 'conscience', 'had', 'carry', 'guilt', 'shame', 'terrible', 'deed', 'rest', 'life', ""'ve"", 'known', 'cases', 'where', 'alone', 'drove', 'people', 'brink', 'insanity.Personally', 'think', 'older', 'plays', 'where', 'tragic', 'character', 'pay', 'price', 'misdeeds', 'probably', 'closer', 'truth']",N/A

I know some people see this as an argument against God's existance and therefore feel a pious need to trash it. I would argue, however, that it is no such thing. There have been enough movies about how the universe tends to right the wrongs of human design, the fact is that doesn't always happen, ON THIS EARTH. To say that there is no divine hand guiding the lives of people who sail through this mortal existance is not necasserily an argument that there is no divine hand at all. This and films like it (the Seventh Seal comes to mind) are more about the truth of the human condition than the truth of the divine condition. Bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people, many times good things happen to you BECAUSE you're bad, and vice-verse. Ideally, the righteous are rewarded and the evil punished, but we do not live in an ideal world. Unfortunatley, film and literature are not resplendent with the truth of this reality. The meek have yet to inherit the earth, and that's exactly what this movie is about. It does not argue atheism, it represents human experience and presents to us the very real temptation to lose hope, but it ends with a plea from beyond the grave (the grave of someone who did lose hope) that we have faith in the small joys of life and look forward with optimism. Why should we retain hope? Because the triumph of the human spirit is that we continue to move forward, and hopefully we learn from past mistakes and our posterity may yet find that extra happiness which eluded us.Enough postulation about God and Atheism, this is a fantastic movie.

446252,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6305075328,"Promise ""promise""","[1, 1]","I love some of Allen's films and hate some.  He did really wacky comedy in his early films, which I never liked and then broke through to a more realistic, romantic and equally funny style in the wonderful Annie Hall.  His reverence for the ultra somber and serious work of Bergman spawned some of his more dreary attempts; he didn't do ""serious"" very well but I give him credit for trying.Here I am amazed at how successful he is at combining his comic view with his very serious themes.  He certainly has a handle on a segment of the population that bears charicature.  His bombastic, egotistical producer (Alan Alda) is wonderful and I loved the twist at the end when this guy gets the girl.  The successful ophtamalogist, very well played by Martin Landau, could be a source of comic contempt and he does come off that way, but still he seems human and not without his redeeming values.  His hood brother, Jack, also very well played by Jerry Orbach, gives another slice of the problem of morality.  Funniest, to me, was the picture of the elderly philosopher whom the Allan character idolizes.  Allen, the film maker, isn't afraid to demythologize this type, either.The rabbi who goes blind (Sam Waterston) seems to be the one character for whom Allen has genuine respect and he closes the film on a serious note by showing the rabbi haltingly dancing with his daughter at her wedding.  I could argue that Allen copped out at the end by tacking a serious ending on what was, up till then, a very comic film.  But I think he really did achieve something quite remarkable in this movie and I recommend it.The whole cast shines, including Mia Farrow, who looks radiant here and Angelica Huston and Claire Bloom.",4,Walking the line between comedy & tragedy,1228089600,"12 1, 2008",2008,1713,"['love', 'Allen', 'films', 'hate', 'did', 'really', 'wacky', 'comedy', 'early', 'films', 'never', 'liked', 'then', 'broke', 'more', 'realistic', 'romantic', 'equally', 'funny', 'style', 'wonderful', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'reverence', 'ultra', 'somber', 'serious', 'work', 'Bergman', 'spawned', 'more', 'dreary', 'attempts', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'serious', 'very', 'well', 'give', 'credit', 'trying.Here', 'am', 'amazed', 'how', 'successful', 'combining', 'comic', 'view', 'very', 'serious', 'themes', 'certainly', 'handle', 'segment', 'population', 'charicature', 'bombastic', 'egotistical', 'producer', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'wonderful', 'loved', 'twist', 'end', 'when', 'guy', 'girl', 'successful', 'ophtamalogist', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'could', 'be', 'source', 'comic', 'contempt', 'come', 'off', 'way', 'still', 'human', 'not', 'redeeming', 'values', 'hood', 'brother', 'Jack', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'slice', 'problem', 'morality', 'Funniest', 'was', 'picture', 'elderly', 'philosopher', 'whom', 'Allan', 'character', 'idolizes', 'Allen', 'film', 'maker', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'demythologize', 'type', 'either.The', 'rabbi', 'who', 'blind', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'be', 'one', 'character', 'whom', 'Allen', 'genuine', 'respect', 'film', 'serious', 'note', 'showing', 'rabbi', 'haltingly', 'dancing', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'could', 'argue', 'Allen', 'copped', 'out', 'end', 'tacking', 'serious', 'ending', 'was', 'up', 'till', 'then', 'very', 'comic', 'film', 'think', 'really', 'did', 'achieve', 'something', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'recommend', 'it.The', 'whole', 'cast', 'shines', 'including', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'who', 'radiant', 'here', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'Claire', 'Bloom']",N/A
446253,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6305075328,Randy Keehn,"[3, 4]","This is a movie about the wrong choices that people make in their lives.  There are many things that make this a near-great movie.  One of them is how the players weave in and out of each other's lives.  Although the movie takes place in New York City, we see very few people outside of the cast.  This gives a sense of intimacy that would be hard to achieve if the movie was handled differently.  The characters are all confronted with opportunities to do the wrong thing and we see how they fare with their various choices.  The main character is a well-respected eye doctor who is experiencing difficulties with his mistress of two years (a poor choice from the past).  His effort to deal with this &quot;problem&quot; leads to the extreme example of poor choices.  Other characters choose to have affairs which are shown in various levels of detail; some we witness, some we just hear about.  Ironically, the second worst thing that happens to someone in the movie occurs when the Rabbi goes blind.  He speaks out for making the right choices but receives no apparent reward in return.  Is this possibly a suggestion that God, in his mercy, sometimes makes wrong choices?  One individual, who we observe through the interesting perspective of documentary film clips, offers great wisdom and perspective and then makes the worst choice of anyone.  There are other choices and other mistakes culminating with a finale that shows us that the only people who are happy are those who either shouldn't be happy or, as we can see, will soon be very unhappy with their latest choice.The movie makes the case for some of the wrong choices that are made.  At least enough of a case that we, the audience, must decide for ourselves.  All this is assisted by excellent acting.  It's not a movie for everyone.  I started watching it with my 10 year old in the room.  I'm not sure if he appreciated what he was able to see before it was his bed time.

446257,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6305075328,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 4]","Woody Allen and an excellent martin Landau occupy opposite poles in this serious and cynical about high crimes and guilt.  Landau plays Judah Rosenthal, a prosperous and respected opthamologist who seems to have the perfect life.  Angelica Huston plays Dolores, his secret mistress - a stewardess who stole his heart and, when he tried to break things off, forced Judah to turn in desperation to his criminal brother, Jack (Jerry Orbach).  Though Jack can offer Judah the ultimate protection from Dolores, Judah has been an essentially honest and upstanding man for most of his life.  Agonized by the guilt for an act of murder he put into motion, and with no apparent sign that he will ever be brought to justice, Judah begins to come undone.Keeping the flick from settling into Judah's performance of self destruction, Allen plays Cliff Stern, another in the long line of losers.  Cliff is the ultimate loser - stuck to a wife who has no respect for him, forced to beg for work producing films he can't respect for people he can't stand (who are, of course, much more successful than he is), and pursuing what he must know to be a futile pursuit for the perfect women (Mia Farrow - which dates the material).  Cliff divides his time between his professional work, watching old movies and occasionally working on his masterpiece - a documentary based on the life of a famous philosopher of optimism who survived the Holocaust.  Nothing goes right for Cliff -  he is forced to turn to his brother in-law, Lester (Alan Alda) for work.  Lester embodies everything that kills Cliff - mostly how Cliff's power is inversely related to how uninspired a hack he is.  Underlying Cliff's almost sheer hatred for Lester, of course, is envy, though Cliff remains too high-minded to admit it.  Mia Farrow plays the woman sought by each - more agressively by Cliff, though you know Cliff's cause is lost the moment Farrow appears.  The last straw is the subject of Allen's documentary, who shows some obvious signs of having been patterned after Primo Levy , the famed Holocaust survivor and optimist who died years after the war under circumstances suggesting suicide.  When Allen's fictitious philosopher ends his life under much less ambiguous circumstances, and having already poisoned things with Lester, Cliff is cast adrift, floating in a melancholy fugue wondering why he's suffering while untalented hacks have all the success.  (The script makes clear that Cliff's tormentors will prosper despite themselves, not even leaving Cliff the slightest hint that his efforts will pay off, or that hacks like Lester will get what's coming to them).  Allen brilliantly sets up Cliff's predicament while Judah goes to pieces wondering if he'll ever have to face justice for having his lover offed.This was a great flick - though it feeds Allen's ego as being the creator of a non-Hollywood (read, pure) movie (we must know that nobody is going to get what they deserve, a very non-commercial prospect), it does it magnificently.  Cliff is a loser, but Allen doesn't arouse pity for him - we never get the idea that Cliff is a man who would deserve success for his work, or that he does deserve love from anybody.  And we also know what Cliff doesn't - that a troubled woman has been murdered by hired killers who will never face justice - which makes his own predicament seem ridiculous.  Yet Allen makes Cliff nonetheless sympathetic, building him up to confront Judah in the last few moments of the flick.  Finally meeting the for the first time, Cliff and Judah toss out their ideas of justice as if they were talking about a movie.  Of course neither tells the other their more personal ideas or fears.  By now, Judah has come full circle, and in hashing his simple idea of a guilt-plagued murderer who suddenly wakes up with a clean conscience, Judah has taught himself to distinguish between justice and closure - which is the difference between morality and a dramatic device.  Morality will always be open to interpretation, he essentially tells Cliff, but closure is something that exists only within the Hollywood movie.",4,"If you want justice, see a Hollywood movie",1025568000,"07 2, 2002",2002,4117,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'excellent', 'martin', 'Landau', 'opposite', 'poles', 'serious', 'cynical', 'about', 'high', 'crimes', 'guilt', 'Landau', 'Judah', 'Rosenthal', 'prosperous', 'respected', 'opthamologist', 'who', 'have', 'perfect', 'life', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'Dolores', 'secret', 'mistress', 'stewardess', 'who', 'stole', 'heart', 'when', 'tried', 'break', 'things', 'off', 'forced', 'Judah', 'turn', 'desperation', 'criminal', 'brother', 'Jack', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'Jack', 'can', 'offer', 'Judah', 'ultimate', 'protection', 'Dolores', 'Judah', 'been', 'essentially', 'honest', 'upstanding', 'man', 'most', 'life', 'Agonized', 'guilt', 'act', 'murder', 'put', 'motion', 'apparent', 'sign', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'brought', 'justice', 'Judah', 'come', 'undone.Keeping', 'flick', 'settling', 'Judah', 'performance', 'self', 'destruction', 'Allen', 'Cliff', 'Stern', 'long', 'line', 'losers', 'Cliff', 'ultimate', 'loser', 'stuck', 'wife', 'who', 'respect', 'forced', 'beg', 'work', 'producing', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'respect', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'who', 'are', 'course', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'pursuing', 'what', 'must', 'know', 'be', 'futile', 'pursuit', 'perfect', 'women', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'material', 'Cliff', 'time', 'professional', 'work', 'watching', 'old', 'movies', 'occasionally', 'working', 'masterpiece', 'documentary', 'based', 'life', 'famous', 'philosopher', 'optimism', 'who', 'survived', 'Holocaust', 'Nothing', 'right', 'Cliff', 'forced', 'turn', 'brother', 'in-law', 'Lester', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'work', 'Lester', 'everything', 'Cliff', 'mostly', 'how', 'Cliff', 'power', 'inversely', 'related', 'how', 'uninspired', 'hack', 'Underlying', 'Cliff', 'almost', 'sheer', 'hatred', 'Lester', 'course', 'envy', 'Cliff', 'too', 'high-minded', 'admit', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'woman', 'sought', 'more', 'agressively', 'Cliff', 'know', 'Cliff', 'cause', 'lost', 'moment', 'Farrow', 'last', 'straw', 'subject', 'Allen', 'documentary', 'who', 'obvious', 'signs', 'having', 'been', 'patterned', 'Primo', 'Levy', 'famed', 'Holocaust', 'survivor', 'optimist', 'who', 'died', 'years', 'war', 'circumstances', 'suggesting', 'suicide', 'When', 'Allen', 'fictitious', 'philosopher', 'life', 'much', 'less', 'ambiguous', 'circumstances', 'having', 'already', 'poisoned', 'things', 'Lester', 'Cliff', 'cast', 'adrift', 'floating', 'melancholy', 'fugue', 'wondering', 'why', 'suffering', 'untalented', 'hacks', 'have', 'success', 'script', 'clear', 'Cliff', 'tormentors', 'will', 'prosper', 'not', 'even', 'leaving', 'Cliff', 'slightest', 'hint', 'efforts', 'will', 'pay', 'off', 'hacks', 'Lester', 'will', 'get', 'what', 'coming', 'Allen', 'brilliantly', 'up', 'Cliff', 'predicament', 'Judah', 'pieces', 'wondering', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'have', 'face', 'justice', 'having', 'lover', 'offed.This', 'was', 'great', 'flick', 'Allen', 'ego', 'being', 'creator', 'non-Hollywood', 'read', 'pure', 'movie', 'must', 'know', 'nobody', 'going', 'get', 'what', 'deserve', 'very', 'non-commercial', 'prospect', 'magnificently', 'Cliff', 'loser', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'arouse', 'pity', 'never', 'get', 'idea', 'Cliff', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'deserve', 'success', 'work', 'deserve', 'love', 'anybody', 'also', 'know', 'what', 'Cliff', ""n't"", 'troubled', 'woman', 'been', 'murdered', 'hired', 'killers', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'face', 'justice', 'own', 'predicament', 'seem', 'ridiculous', 'Allen', 'Cliff', 'nonetheless', 'sympathetic', 'building', 'confront', 'Judah', 'last', 'few', 'moments', 'flick', 'Finally', 'meeting', 'first', 'time', 'Cliff', 'Judah', 'toss', 'out', 'ideas', 'justice', 'were', 'talking', 'movie', 'course', 'other', 'more', 'personal', 'ideas', 'fears', 'now', 'Judah', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'hashing', 'simple', 'idea', 'guilt-plagued', 'murderer', 'who', 'suddenly', 'up', 'clean', 'conscience', 'Judah', 'taught', 'distinguish', 'justice', 'closure', 'difference', 'morality', 'dramatic', 'device', 'Morality', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'open', 'interpretation', 'essentially', 'Cliff', 'closure', 'something', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'movie']",N/A

Thanks, Carter.Crimes and Misdemeanors is an apt title for this complex, dark, yet sometimes amusing film by Woody Allen. First, the crimes. Judah Rosenthal, a highly successful NYC eye doctor, wants to rid himself of his mistress of two years who has become threatening and dangerous to his career. He seeks the help of his brother Jack, who has connections to the underworld. Jack assures his brother that he can make his problem go away with money paid to a professional contract killer. At first the doctor is shocked and offended, but later begins to accept the suggestion as a way out of his problem. The hit is made; the crime has been committed; the doctor is free of his problem.Will the doctor get caught and punished? It used to be that we could count on Hollywood to reinforce the notion that crime does not pay, but those day are long gone and Woody Allen has no intention of reviving them. At first the doctor feels guilt, but soon that healthy emotion fades away and life goes on for him as if nothing had happened. In the crimes portion of this film the villain appears to be a good guy and he gets away with murder. Woody Allen shows us what we already knew but occasionally need to be reminded of; people who seem good are capable of murder.The Misdemeanors portion of the film shows us Allen, Cliff Stern, having fun with a pompous movie producer who commissions him to make a documentary of the producer's life. Cliff hates and despises the producer, who appears to be an outgoing, energetic, friendly person. Cliff knows better; his documentary of the producer shows him to be a vain, self-important, manipulative user. In his documentary Cliff first compares the producer to Benito Mussolini and then to a talking mule who spouts one of the producer's favorite lines: ""If it bends, it's funny; if it breaks, it's not."" Here is Woody Allen at his best, poking fun at the rich and famous.Crimes and Misdemeanors gives us no answers to life's important questions. Allen tells a story and lets us decide for ourselves how to judge the behavior of his eclectic cast of characters. His cast his uniformly excellent. Martin Landau gives a fine, tortured performance as the eye doctor who decides to have his mistress murdered. Alan Alda is also excellent as the pompous producer whom Allen skews so mercilessly. The rest of the supporting cast, including Mia Farrow, is equally effective in this thought provoking, serious, yet at times humorous film. Crimes and Misdemeanors is Woody Allen at the top of his game, both as director and star of his own show. This is a film to enjoy as good storytelling, and ponder for its thought provoking content.

This movie doesn't change that:  you'll probably love it if you like Allen, but if he always annoys you, then you shouldn't expect anything different.Like many of Allen's later day dramas, he's not playing the main character.  Instead, the film tells the story of several people who are loosely connected.  In this case, the main character is Martin Landau, a successful opthamologist who's having an affair with Anjelica Huston.  When she threatens to blow the whistle, he's forced to do something sinister to protect his marriage.The movie turns into an interesting study of right versus wrong and even asks a lot of questions about religion by focusing on Landau's story, as well as the individual stories of other characters, like a rabbi played by Sam Waterson, and a struggling documentary maker played by Allen himself.For the most part, this movie is a drama, but that doesn't mean it's free of laughs.  Allen provides plenty of comic relief through his own character.

The women he has an affair with goes crazy and threatens to destroy the man's marriage. From this point his actions unravel and the consequences ensue. Crimes and Misdemeanors follows the trend of many Woody Allen films. It is smart, human, funny, and heart breaking all at once. Overall it is very intelligent & worthwhile theater.  Anyone will most likely be able to read into the story and mediate on the truth within.  It was made in the late 80s and bears the look & feel of that time.

I also thought the subject matter was sort of heavy and not very good for entertaining purposes.The second time I saw this movie I looked at it from a dramatic perspective.  I did not expect this movie to be a comedy or a light hearted drama.  This is a full fledged heavy drama with adultry, neurosis, and murder.  The plot is constantly interesting and so are the characters.  Woody Allen's character, of course, is the best. Alan Alda and Mia Farrow are both hilarious and goofy in this movie.  The movie leaves me feeling cold only because the main character did not get caught for murder and he got away with it and felt no guilt towards the end.  There may have been more details to this complex movie that I missed out on, but other than that there is some hilarious comic dialog and situations thrown in intermittently to keep the movie from being too tedius, overwhelming, and heavy.  If you like serious dramatic movies and Woody Allen then I suggest you watch, rent, or buy this movie.Other Woody Allen movies I enjoy watching are:  Husbands and Wives, Deconstructing Harry, Interiors, Small time crooks, Radio Days, Annie Hall, and scenes from a mall.",4,Impressive after watching it a second time.,1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,1302,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'cold', 'insensitive', 'unfunny', 'personally', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'main', 'character', 'Judah', 'also', 'thought', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'sort', 'heavy', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'entertaining', 'purposes.The', 'second', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'looked', 'dramatic', 'perspective', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'movie', 'be', 'comedy', 'light', 'hearted', 'drama', 'full', 'fledged', 'heavy', 'drama', 'adultry', 'neurosis', 'murder', 'plot', 'constantly', 'interesting', 'so', 'are', 'characters', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'course', 'best', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'are', 'hilarious', 'goofy', 'movie', 'movie', 'feeling', 'cold', 'only', 'main', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'caught', 'murder', 'got', 'away', 'felt', 'guilt', 'end', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'details', 'complex', 'movie', 'missed', 'out', 'other', 'hilarious', 'comic', 'dialog', 'situations', 'thrown', 'intermittently', 'keep', 'movie', 'being', 'too', 'tedius', 'overwhelming', 'heavy', 'like', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'movies', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'then', 'suggest', 'watch', 'rent', 'buy', 'movie.Other', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'are', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'Interiors', 'Small', 'time', 'crooks', 'Radio', 'Days', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'scenes', 'mall']",N/A

Released in a limited edition of 3000, ""Crimes"" remains a deft black comedy about our moral choices focusing on a well regarded ophthalmologist Judah Rosenthal (Academy Award winner Martin Landau)who hires his brother Jack (the late great Jerry Orbach) to kill his clingy mistress Dolores (Anjelica Huston). Writer-director Allen balances this story with a second one carefully and cleverly interwoven with the first focusing on a documentary film director Clif (Allen) who, desperate for success, decides to make a documentary on his brother-in-law an egoistic TV producer (Alan Alda).Critically acclaimed at the time of its release, the film was nominated for numerous Oscars at the time and demonstrates Allen's mastery at mixing drama with black comedy. Landau gives a brilliant performance.The blu-ray receives a very nice looking transfer where colors pop and detail is exceptionally good. The mono audio sounds extremely good as well. We get English subtitles for the film.The special features are, not surprisingly, limited. Allen doesn't do commentary tracks and rarely provides any insight into his work. It would have been nice to have a commentary track from others connected with the film. We get an isolated score/sound effects track and the original trailer. Julie Kirgo provides a solid booklet discussing the film. While I am disappointed that there wasn't more of an effort made at creating new special features here including interviews with the surviving cast (Huston, Alda, Landau for example).This limited edition release (it's limited to 3000) is not region locked. This is a nice presentation of a classic film and the transfer makes this worthwhile to pick up but I do wish we had gotten more special featurs on this classic film.",5,Classic Allen film receives a strong looking blu-ray transfer but lacks special features (limited edition to 3000),1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,1872,"['One', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'finest', 'films', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'very', 'nice', 'blu-ray', 'upgrade', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'Released', 'limited', 'edition', '3000', 'Crimes', 'deft', 'black', 'comedy', 'moral', 'choices', 'focusing', 'well', 'regarded', 'ophthalmologist', 'Judah', 'Rosenthal', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'who', 'brother', 'Jack', 'late', 'great', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'kill', 'clingy', 'mistress', 'Dolores', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Writer-director', 'Allen', 'balances', 'story', 'second', 'one', 'carefully', 'cleverly', 'interwoven', 'first', 'focusing', 'documentary', 'film', 'director', 'Clif', 'Allen', 'who', 'desperate', 'success', 'make', 'documentary', 'brother-in-law', 'egoistic', 'TV', 'producer', 'Alan', 'Alda', '.Critically', 'acclaimed', 'time', 'release', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'numerous', 'Oscars', 'time', 'Allen', 'mastery', 'mixing', 'drama', 'black', 'comedy', 'Landau', 'brilliant', 'performance.The', 'blu-ray', 'very', 'nice', 'looking', 'transfer', 'where', 'colors', 'pop', 'detail', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'mono', 'audio', 'extremely', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'English', 'subtitles', 'film.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'limited', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'do', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'rarely', 'insight', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'commentary', 'track', 'others', 'connected', 'film', 'get', 'isolated', 'score/sound', 'effects', 'track', 'original', 'trailer', 'Julie', 'Kirgo', 'solid', 'booklet', 'discussing', 'film', 'am', 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'effort', 'made', 'creating', 'new', 'special', 'features', 'here', 'including', 'interviews', 'surviving', 'cast', 'Huston', 'Alda', 'Landau', 'example', '.This', 'limited', 'edition', 'release', 'limited', '3000', 'not', 'region', 'locked', 'nice', 'presentation', 'classic', 'film', 'transfer', 'worthwhile', 'pick', 'up', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'gotten', 'more', 'special', 'featurs', 'classic', 'film']",N/A

446267,A35PRTXTXU9EZF,6305075328,William T. Parnell,"[2, 3]","Woody Allen's most creative film is a masterful blend of romantic comedy and gut-wrenching drama. This is perhaps his best film and certainly should be on anyone's list of top films of the 20th century.The parallel plots revolve around Clifford Stern (Woody Allen), a struggling documentary filmmaker trying to win a girl (Mia Farrow) away from his successful brother-in-law (Alan Alda), and Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau), a prominent ophthalmologist who has an affair with a depressed stewardess (Angelica Houston). The performances are top-flight by all involved, but especially noteworthy are Allen and Landau, whose work here is probably the best of his career. Sam Waterston does a convincing turn as a Rabbi who provides conscience and counsel for Landau's conflicted character.Both of the lead characters face a moral dilemma. Will Cliff Stern stay true to his ideals or will he sell out and do a lucrative film about his brother-in-law whom he despises? And will Dr. Rosenthal listen to his father's ""voice"" and his Rabbi's advice and admit his infidelity or choose a more sinister solution? The answers are revealed in a brilliant closing scene after a chance encounter between the two men.This film is presented in a pleasing 16:9 widescreen version with excellent picture quality. The sound is mono only, which is true of most of Allen's films. The extras are limited to a trailer and a collectable booklet that features some behind the scenes tidbits from and about Allen.Allen fans will no doubt add Crimes and Misdemeanors to their list of Woody's best along with Hannah and Her Sisters, Annie Hall, and Husbands and Wives.

446268,A1COQ2DOO1O9HD,6305075328,Wing J. Flanagan,"[11, 13]","In Crimes and Misdemeanors, Woody Allen recalls the work of the great European directors (especially Bergman's soul-searching preoccupation with matters of faith). Two stories unfold in parallel: that of a successful ophthalmologist (played by Martin Landau), whose predicament with an extra-marital affair causes him to do the unthinkable; and a the serio-comic flirtations of a small-time documentary film-maker (played by Allen himself) contemplating his own extramarital romp with a production assistant (Mia Farrow).Landau's character, Judah Rosenthal, afraid of ruination, calls upon his brother (Law and Order's Jerry Orbach) to make his little indiscretion ""disappear"". She disappears, all right - into oblivion, the victim of a hit-man Orbach's character met through his years in the restaurant business.Allen's character, by far much lighter and more innocent, is trying to finance a documentary on an upbeat Holocaust survivor and Philosophy professor by condescending to make a television biography of his shallow, egotistical brother-in-law, a famous sit-com producer (Alan Alda).What these two stories have in common is a deepening ethical dilemma posed by the ambiguity of moral standards in the absence of religious faith. Although raised in a traditionally religious Jewish household, Judah is not, himself, a believer - at least, until the guilt of his mistress' murder presses down upon him almost unbearably. Then he begins to fantasize that he will be caught and punished, if only because the seeing eye of God is everywhere, and He will make certain of it. Similarly, Allen's character is driven to the point of crisis not only by his failure to snag his own mistress, but by the suicide of the professor whose life seemed the very model of spiritual triumph in the face of adversity.What emerges from the convergence of these two stories is a great envy and baleful respect for those who can have faith. Faith is a gift, as one character points out, like musical talent. It is the ability to walk in darkness, oblivious to the probable truth that there is only chaos in the Universe, and be contented in that ignorance.The DVD lacks a director's commentary or any other nice features, but it is handsomely produced, with the work of cinematographer Sven Nykvist (long-time collaborator of Igmar Bergman) beautifully showcased. Anjelica Houston and Sam Waterston lend excellent support as Judah's mistress and a rabbi patient who is gradually losing his sight.For those viewers who enjoy philosophical depth in films, and who eschew easy, predigested answers, this film is most certainly a must-see.",5,Woody Allen's finest serious film,1032048000,"09 15, 2002",2002,2621,"['Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'work', 'great', 'European', 'directors', 'especially', 'Bergman', 'soul-searching', 'preoccupation', 'matters', 'faith', 'Two', 'stories', 'unfold', 'parallel', 'successful', 'ophthalmologist', 'played', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'predicament', 'extra-marital', 'affair', 'do', 'unthinkable', 'serio-comic', 'flirtations', 'small-time', 'documentary', 'film-maker', 'played', 'Allen', 'contemplating', 'own', 'extramarital', 'romp', 'production', 'assistant', 'Mia', 'Farrow', '.Landau', 'character', 'Judah', 'Rosenthal', 'afraid', 'ruination', 'brother', 'Law', 'Order', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'make', 'little', 'indiscretion', 'disappear', 'right', 'oblivion', 'victim', 'hit-man', 'Orbach', 'character', 'met', 'years', 'restaurant', 'business.Allen', 'character', 'far', 'much', 'lighter', 'more', 'innocent', 'trying', 'finance', 'documentary', 'upbeat', 'Holocaust', 'survivor', 'Philosophy', 'professor', 'condescending', 'make', 'television', 'biography', 'shallow', 'egotistical', 'brother-in-law', 'famous', 'sit-com', 'producer', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'two', 'stories', 'have', 'common', 'deepening', 'ethical', 'dilemma', 'posed', 'ambiguity', 'moral', 'standards', 'absence', 'religious', 'faith', 'raised', 'traditionally', 'religious', 'Jewish', 'household', 'Judah', 'not', 'believer', 'least', 'guilt', 'mistress', 'murder', 'presses', 'down', 'almost', 'unbearably', 'Then', 'fantasize', 'will', 'be', 'caught', 'punished', 'only', 'seeing', 'eye', 'God', 'everywhere', 'will', 'make', 'certain', 'Similarly', 'Allen', 'character', 'driven', 'point', 'crisis', 'not', 'only', 'failure', 'snag', 'own', 'mistress', 'suicide', 'professor', 'life', 'seemed', 'very', 'model', 'spiritual', 'triumph', 'face', 'adversity.What', 'convergence', 'two', 'stories', 'great', 'envy', 'baleful', 'respect', 'who', 'can', 'have', 'faith', 'Faith', 'gift', 'one', 'character', 'points', 'out', 'musical', 'talent', 'ability', 'walk', 'darkness', 'oblivious', 'probable', 'truth', 'only', 'chaos', 'Universe', 'be', 'contented', 'ignorance.The', 'DVD', 'director', 'commentary', 'other', 'nice', 'features', 'handsomely', 'produced', 'work', 'cinematographer', 'Sven', 'Nykvist', 'long-time', 'collaborator', 'Igmar', 'Bergman', 'beautifully', 'showcased', 'Anjelica', 'Houston', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'lend', 'excellent', 'support', 'Judah', 'mistress', 'rabbi', 'patient', 'who', 'gradually', 'losing', 'sight.For', 'viewers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'philosophical', 'depth', 'films', 'who', 'eschew', 'easy', 'predigested', 'answers', 'film', 'most', 'certainly', 'must-see']",N/A
