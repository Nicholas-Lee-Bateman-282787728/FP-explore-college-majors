""The Ten Commandments"" has an AMAZINGLY beautiful picture, with very accurate colors (as with the flesh tones, for example), vivid colors, and it's EXTREMELY sharp.  The audio is excellent as well. BluRay.com lauds this blu-ray as being one of the best ever done, the standard for how to remaster a film for blu-ray, and I agree strongly.  You will be amazed, literally, by the gorgeous HD picture quality. I'm very pleased with this purchase.You can literally see the threads and other small intricacies in the clothing and backgrounds, and of course in the actors' faces, right from the movie's very beginning. GREAT job on this film's Blu-Ray picture, just beautiful HD quality.  The very best blu-ray of an older film, quality-wise, that I've seen!  The movie looks about 40 years newer than it is!I have always loved this film for its story, script, and acting.  One of my favorites; a long film that you seem to get through quickly, not tediously, every time.Both movies are split into 2 discs each, broken at the intermissions (thus 4 total discs in this package), but this is done to allow for high MbPS transfers-- just what we customers should want.No review yet for Ben-Hur, which I haven't viewed yet.",5,"AMAZING blu-ray picture for ""The Ten Commandments""",1378598400,"09 8, 2013",2013,1324,"['review', 'blu-ray', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'quality', 'etc.', 'not', 'how', 'good', 'story', 'acting', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'AMAZINGLY', 'beautiful', 'picture', 'very', 'accurate', 'colors', 'flesh', 'tones', 'example', 'vivid', 'colors', 'EXTREMELY', 'sharp', 'audio', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'BluRay.com', 'blu-ray', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'done', 'standard', 'how', 'remaster', 'film', 'blu-ray', 'agree', 'strongly', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'literally', 'gorgeous', 'HD', 'picture', 'quality', ""'m"", 'very', 'pleased', 'purchase.You', 'can', 'literally', 'see', 'threads', 'other', 'small', 'intricacies', 'clothing', 'backgrounds', 'course', 'actors', 'right', 'movie', 'very', 'beginning', 'GREAT', 'job', 'film', 'Blu-Ray', 'picture', 'just', 'beautiful', 'HD', 'quality', 'very', 'best', 'blu-ray', 'older', 'film', 'quality-wise', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', '40', 'years', 'newer', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'film', 'story', 'script', 'acting', 'One', 'favorites', 'long', 'film', 'seem', 'get', 'quickly', 'not', 'tediously', 'time.Both', 'movies', 'are', 'split', '2', 'discs', 'broken', 'intermissions', 'thus', '4', 'total', 'discs', 'package', 'done', 'allow', 'high', 'MbPS', 'transfers', 'just', 'what', 'customers', 'should', 'want.No', 'review', 'yet', 'Ben-Hur', 'have', ""n't"", 'viewed', 'yet']",Ben-Hur: The Ten Commandments

In the power play that follows, Judah is exiled and goes on an adventure that sees him rising up again from the bottom.In The Ten Commandments (1956), Heston stars as Moses in the epic biblical drama of the life of Moses.I found both of these films to be excellent in many ways, from the acting, cinematography, music, set design, story, and so on.

1613872,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B00AMSLDW4,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[3, 5]","Ben-Hur: A Tale of the ChristPrince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston of Ten Commandments fame) was raised up with his best Roman buddy Messala (Stephen Boyd). Little did they know at the time that they would grow up become adversaries, and as a result this would lead to may adventures. In the process Judah leads many different lives that parallels and crosses the life of Jesus.We see Judah in the mines, on the galleys, and even adopted by a roman Noble man as young Arrius. Mean time back at home his family is incarcerated by Messala leading to trials and tribulation that only Jesus can correct.-------------------------------------------------A lot of time and money went into this MGM production that netted 11 Academy Awards, along with many others such as BAFAT, David di Donatello, Directors Guild of America, Golden Globes, Laurel, Writers Guild of America, &#8230;etc.You will be so intrigued that you may not notice the 212+ minutes depending on the version.One highlight, the chariot race was reproduced many times in various forms.Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ===========================The definitive Ten Commandments.An interesting title as the Commandment part is a tad closer to the end of the movie. Cecil B. DeMille takes a few liberties with history; however if he did not then this would have been some dry documentary instead of a great epic. This story is more of the life and times of Moses from birth to the last farewell. We see rivalry, temptation, brick making and dancing girls.One item that Cecil tactfully worked around is where do you think Anne Baxter ...Nefretiri came from? Can you say sister? As the bloodlines from Egyptians, came through the women. That is why who ever married her would become pharaoh.The graphics are great for the time; the plagues are really spooky and we all still hold the image of the parting of the sea. The acting has that 50's epic feel. Elmer Bernstein's music adds a hidden dimension to the story and you will not be able to get it out of your head. Edward G. Robinson made a great Dathan; He gets to be a modern day Dathan in &#8220;Key Largo&#8221; (1948). Is it not interesting that Pharaoh Rameses in The Prince of Egypt - DTS (1998) looks like Yul Brynner?This is the one version most people relate too.

I want to be able to enjoy the Collectors Edition on Special occasions (Like on Yom Kippor or Passover).  I like this two in one because I can watch either one without feeling bad about opening up the collectors edition (except on the Holy Days).  Plus I can put it on my Blu-Ray/movie shelf without finding a special place for it (like I do the collectors edition).Plus they are two great Epic Movies.  Both are well done.  With great color.  Lavish sets (The 10 Commandments was filmed in alot of locations in Egypt & the Sinai Penesula Area).  And of course both have Charlton Heston (GREAT ACTING BY HIM!!!!!

Each film is presented on two disks ( total of four Blurays), and overtures as well as intermissions, etc. included). The commentaries are incredible, especially for ""The Ten Commandments"". You'll be amazed at the insights and details! Like taking a College course! Fun as can be. Multiple trailers are here, too. I'd seen ""The Ten Commandments"" many times on TV, but this is the first time I'd watched ""Ben-Hur"". All that I can say is it makes my list of all-time great films hands down! The chariot race is, of course, crazy-great, but there is so much more to it. ""Ben-Hur"" netted 11 Oscars out of 12  nominations, including Best Actor for Charleton Heston and Best Picture. It's easy to see why.(In the interest of full-disclosure, there is one scene with Heston in Jack Hawkins' chamber on the ship where there is a ""skip"" of a few film frames.

Stenroos ""Sibelius fan""","[36, 44]","I was surprised when I saw that these two Charlton Heston films had been slated for release as a Warner Brothers ""Double Feature"" with a list price under $20. I paid $14.95, or about $17 with tax through amazon.Surprised because ""Ben-Hur"" was just re-released in a painstaking and expensive ""50th Anniversary"" remastering in 2011, and that is the version included here (all that money spent and there's STILL distortion in the soundtrack at some points!). Surprised again, because ""The Ten Commandments"" received its latest and greatest remaster in 2011 as well in a 6K ""Two-Disc Special Edition,"" and that SE is the version included here. In fact, Amazon lists the price of that 2-BD SE of ""Ten"" at $21.95 (!?), which is $7 more than the selling price of the Double Feature set under review. Go figure.There are FOUR BDs in this set. Both movies time out at over 3 hours long, so they are each spread over two BDs, breaking at the most-natural point imaginable: the Intermission. I think that both movies could have been fit on one BD each, but whatever.As far as extras go, ""Ben-Hur"" contains an informative commentary by film historian T. Gene Hatcher with Charlton Heston, and a music-only track showcasing Miklos Rozsa's award-winning score and the theatrical trailers. I would mention that the UCE of this film contains an additional disc that is absolutely loaded with extra features, including the silent movie version from 1925. The extras on ""Ten"" include three trailers (with that from 1956 being of an extended length and featuring Cecil B DeMille himself), a commentary track, and a short newsreel of the 1956 NYC premiere on Disc 2.So you get these two classic films - the huge spectacle, the bad acting (""Oh, Moses, Moses!"") and everything else - for next to nothing. You can buy the films as a twofer and save around $5, or you can buy them separately for around $10 each. The fantasy that is the Bible and Bible-related fictions like Ben-Hur never looked better than they do in these 1950s Hollywood epics...and you can now get them on BD for about what it would have cost you and your date to see them in a theater back in the day.More evidence that we are fast approaching the days when hardcopy media for films and music will be a thing of the past. One can buy BDs of classic films for next to nothing these days. BDs are cheaper than DVDs ever were, just as DVDs were eventually cheaper than VHS ever was.
