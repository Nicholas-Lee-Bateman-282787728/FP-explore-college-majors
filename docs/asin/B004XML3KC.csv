Nicholas ""gotta have a book""","[8, 8]","""They finally got it right"", I heard several say, Orthodox friends who'd been there and then seen this 60 Minutes look at Mt. Athos.  CBS was refused entry to these monastic communities or to do this story for almost 30 years.  The monks have changed their minds and opened up some.  Now we have this reverent overview of the Holy Mountain, its impact through the last 1,000 years and today.I've since booked my trip to this place for 2013 and look forward to walking the dirt roads between monasteries here.  I will venerate the relics of Father Porphyrios and others who have shown us the light from this mountain.  I recommend this DVD.  Although it is available online, having a DVD to pop in the player for friends would be nice.  This is a warm story on what it is like to make an entire simple life of simply, talking to God, living in community with others, staying...near.",5,Going there.,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,881,"['finally', 'got', 'right', 'heard', 'several', 'say', 'Orthodox', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'there', 'then', 'seen', '60', 'Minutes', 'look', 'Mt', 'Athos', 'CBS', 'was', 'refused', 'entry', 'monastic', 'communities', 'do', 'story', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'monks', 'have', 'changed', 'minds', 'opened', 'up', 'Now', 'have', 'reverent', 'overview', 'Holy', 'Mountain', 'impact', 'last', '1,000', 'years', 'today.I', ""'ve"", 'booked', 'trip', 'place', '2013', 'look', 'forward', 'walking', 'dirt', 'roads', 'monasteries', 'here', 'will', 'venerate', 'relics', 'Father', 'Porphyrios', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'shown', 'light', 'mountain', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'available', 'online', 'having', 'DVD', 'pop', 'player', 'friends', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'warm', 'story', 'what', 'make', 'entire', 'simple', 'life', 'simply', 'talking', 'God', 'living', 'community', 'others', 'staying']",Mt.

1432502,AS3HPOURIPQFA,B004XML3KC,"Diane T. Granata ""Reviewer""","[1, 1]",Most monasteries on Mt. Athos do not allow for filming or pictures. I was pleased that one monastery gave a glimpse of a service. All monasteries on Mt. Athos are for men only. This is because the Theotokos (mother of God or Virgin Mary) visited the mountain and from then on no women were/are allowed. The 60 minute documentary allowed me a glimpse of what it is like on the Holy Mountain. I hope 60 minutes is allowed another visit.,5,Excellent presentation,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,434,"['Most', 'monasteries', 'Mt', 'Athos', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'filming', 'pictures', 'was', 'pleased', 'one', 'monastery', 'gave', 'glimpse', 'service', 'monasteries', 'Mt', 'Athos', 'are', 'men', 'only', 'Theotokos', 'mother', 'God', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'visited', 'mountain', 'then', 'women', 'were/are', 'allowed', '60', 'minute', 'documentary', 'allowed', 'glimpse', 'what', 'Holy', 'Mountain', 'hope', '60', 'minutes', 'allowed', 'visit']",Mt.

After reading a lot about the Byzantine Empire, which initially supported the monasteries on Mount Athos, I had bought one of the several books on the suject, which I found to be unsatisfactory because of its black and white photographs. What this program makes clear is what a beautiful place Mount Athos is, both in terms of its natural surrounding and the stunning architecture.While the interviews with the monks are short (the entire program only lasts 25 minutes), I found them to be quite interesting, unlike those in Mysteries of the Jesus Prayer.All in all, an interesting and enjoyable program.",5,Beautiful Filming and Interesting Interviews,1306886400,"06 1, 2011",2011,741,"['Having', 'foundMysteries', 'Jesus', 'Prayerto', 'be', 'intellectually', 'shallow', 'moved', 'program', 'think', 'substantially', 'better', 'reading', 'lot', 'Byzantine', 'Empire', 'initially', 'supported', 'monasteries', 'Mount', 'Athos', 'had', 'bought', 'one', 'several', 'books', 'suject', 'found', 'be', 'unsatisfactory', 'black', 'white', 'photographs', 'What', 'program', 'clear', 'what', 'beautiful', 'place', 'Mount', 'Athos', 'terms', 'natural', 'surrounding', 'stunning', 'interviews', 'monks', 'are', 'short', 'entire', 'program', 'only', '25', 'minutes', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'interesting', 'Mysteries', 'Jesus', 'Prayer.All', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'program']",Mt.

1432504,A21Y8IDJK7T4ES,B004XML3KC,"jswell ""James""","[42, 49]","I was extremely fortunate to visit Mt. Athos in 1974. Without a doubt, the most surreal experience of my life. I am not Greek Orthodox, and obtained a visa from the Greek Consulate in Chicago that I then had to take to the Greek Government in Athens. It involved flying to Thessaloniki, Greece, taking a 3 hour school bus ride, surrendering my passport, boarding a ferry for an hour trip down the Peninsula. Then a harrowing school bus ride up to the main exit. I applied as a student of Byzantine Architecture, and, as a foreigner, was separated from the three young Greek men I met who spoke English. I slept in a cell for non-Greeks. There are no female anythings on the site; so no milk, eggs; moldy cheese and bread and tomatoes. You must walk on dirt paths from one monetary to another. My Greek did me no good; the monks spoke Church Greek. Luckily, my young friends translated for me!Since I was there, they have added some electricity. Photography was allowed, but not of the monks, and the Churches were illuminated only by oil and candles. I felt as if I was literally on the moon, cut off from civilization as I was. I was well treated and it probably ranks as the most exotic place on the planet.BUY this DVD!

1432505,A68QXK0H88J4I,B004XML3KC,matt,"[7, 7]","This short segement from 60 Minutes, about 20 minutes in length, is a rare glimpse into the life of the Monks of Mt Athos, the Heart of Eastern Orthodox monasticism and prayer. With breathtaking camera shots and slow editing, the pacing of the segment reflects the tempo of the monastic life. Interviews with various monastics recount how and why they chose this uncommon way of life, which is a service of love not only to God and their fellow monks, but for the whole world on account of the power of their prayers. It is really well-done and I recommend it heartily.Viewers may also be interested in a few books related to Eastern Orthodoxy and Athos:The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality,The Jesus Prayer,The Jesus Prayer: The Ancient Desert Prayer that Tunes the Heart to GodandThe Monk of Mount Athos: Staretz Selouan 1866-1938. There are many many more. Of course, what unites all Orthodox is our bond in Christ as His Body, and this is solidified in our liturgical life. So if you are really interested in Orthodoxy, begin to attend our liturgies and talk to some folks who are seeking to live out the gospel in an Eastern tune.
