A slow, child-like character played by Tom Hulce, in his greatest performance ever.  Eugene struggles to care for Dominick and carry on a relationship with Jennifer (Jamie Lee Curtis).  Although, her character is basically very shallow, and was most likely writen into the script to bring conflict between the two main characters, but over all this film is a classic and one of Robert M. Young's best.

It's not pleasant material.However, it's a good movie and the acting is good, too. The story will sit with you awhile.""Dominick"" is the mentally-disabled guy and is played by Tom Hulce. I think this might be Hulce's best role ever. He's looked after by a med student, ""Eugene,"" played by Ray Liotta, who became a star the following year with Kevin Costner's ""Field Of Dreams.""Dominick is a goodhearted garbage man who reads ""Hulk"" comic books and loves wrestling. He's the type of ""slow"" guy that you can't help but love and root for to live a happy life.

Ray Liotta proves why he is one of our generation's best actors, while Tom Hulce impresses in a way he hasn't done since &quot;Amadeus.&quot;  I'm one of those folks who absolutely hated the heart string pulls of &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; which I found manipulative in a not-so-good-way.  This flick, in comparison, never works against the viewer, by making us choose a &quot;bad guy&quot; or be antagonistic towards the victim.  Therein lies its beauty - this tale of two brothers refuses to victimize either one of them and is therefore startling in its effectiveness.  Critics panned the flick during an era where grown men could not cry and get away with it.  Today, the message is just as powerful, only men CAN cry without being labeled as anything less than men.  This story of two men whose lives are eternally tied together despite their own challenges, hopes and dreams, is a valentine to brotherhood, fraternity and family.  In these times of war, &quot;Dominick and Eugene&quot; reminds us what it means to be a family.  A wonderful movie you will treasure forever.

A story about two brothers, Dominick (Hulce) a slow-witted garbageman with a heart of gold who supports his Med School brother Eugene (Liotta). These superb actors draw you into their relationship so convincingly that you feel you're witnessing a real life drama instead of a movie. Eugene's love for Dominick is handled with dignity and sensitivity, as he constantly tries to balance his brother's needs with his own. There are so many nuances and revelations in this story that I fear that I can spoil it if I reveal too much of it. Suffice it to say, the purpose of my review is to whet the appetite of the reader without spoiling their dinner. This movie has a lot to say and does so brillantly. Both Hulce and Liotta should have been oscar winners for their performances in this film. Tom Hulce has to be one of the most underrated actors; his performance in &quot;Amadeus&quot; was also brilliant. In that film, he and F.
