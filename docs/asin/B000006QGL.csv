494868,A18YB1FYPWXEHQ,B000006QGL,Kimberly A. King,"[3, 4]","As a retired military member, I have to admire all that Audie Murphy did for his country and for his comrades.  This is a well put together documentary, with lots of video and still photos, which reminds you that war, for the combat veteran, goes well beyond the battlefield.The documentary goes into Murphy's life after the war, and it touches your heart to think the war truly never left him.  Murphy's sister is interviewed, and the movie does a great job of showing the life of this American Hero.  It left me feeling very sad for Audie, as he gave so much, and suffered a great deal.",4,Sad and True Tale,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,588,"['retired', 'military', 'member', 'have', 'admire', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'did', 'country', 'comrades', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'documentary', 'lots', 'video', 'still', 'photos', 'war', 'combat', 'veteran', 'well', 'battlefield.The', 'documentary', 'Murphy', 'life', 'war', 'heart', 'think', 'war', 'truly', 'never', 'left', 'Murphy', 'sister', 'interviewed', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'life', 'American', 'Hero', 'left', 'feeling', 'very', 'sad', 'Audie', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'suffered', 'great', 'deal']",Biography - Audie Murphy VHS
494869,A3M6V9ANORQPAD,B000006QGL,"Nitengail ""Nite""","[1, 1]","Audie Murphy was the most decorated soldier during World War II.  He was a Texas boy and raised in poverty.  He had difficulty getting accepted into the Military because of his young age and small stature.  His older sister gave permission for him to enlist.  He was accepted into the army at age 17 after being turned down by the other branches. He was a crack shot, due to his hunting game to feed his family.  He received the Congressional Medal of Honor just before his 19th birthday, due to his actions on the battlefield.  There is a museum with pictures and all his medals at Greenville TX.  It is truly inspiring.  He was in his 40's, when he died in a plane crash.  He suffered from PTSD all his life from the horrors he saw during the war and slept with a gun under his pillow.  My only complaint was the video  was a little too short.  The biography was inspiring and well worth the money.  I would highly recommend this important piece of history.",5,Biography - Audie Murphy: Great American Hero,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,959,"['Audie', 'Murphy', 'was', 'most', 'decorated', 'soldier', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'Texas', 'boy', 'raised', 'poverty', 'had', 'difficulty', 'getting', 'accepted', 'Military', 'young', 'age', 'small', 'stature', 'older', 'sister', 'gave', 'permission', 'enlist', 'was', 'accepted', 'army', 'age', '17', 'being', 'turned', 'down', 'other', 'branches', 'was', 'crack', 'shot', 'due', 'hunting', 'game', 'feed', 'family', 'received', 'Congressional', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'just', '19th', 'birthday', 'due', 'actions', 'battlefield', 'museum', 'pictures', 'medals', 'Greenville', 'TX', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'was', '40', 'when', 'died', 'plane', 'crash', 'suffered', 'PTSD', 'life', 'horrors', 'saw', 'war', 'slept', 'gun', 'pillow', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'video', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'short', 'biography', 'was', 'inspiring', 'well', 'money', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'important', 'piece', 'history']",Biography - Audie Murphy VHS

It wasn't until much later that I learned that he was a WOrld War II Hero. His love for his country and duty should be known even today.  You should be able to ask students who Audie Murphy was and they should be able to identify him as a WWII vet and hero.  I would tell anyone that knows his for his acting ability that they should get this DVD and watch.,5,Awesome!!!!!
