907313,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B0009KA7BS,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[2, 2]","I generally hate comic book films because they suck miserably. Aside from this, The Dark Knight, Iron Man, and Hellboy, I pretty much hate everything else. I was disappointed that this film got mixed reviews from critics and moviegoers, but I enjoyed it for what it was and I believe it to be underappreciated.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The story is about John Constantine; a chain-smoking, pissed off exorcist who has been barred from the gates of Heaven, but must do God's work by deporting half-breed demons (Part human, part demon) who break the rules back to Hell, who gets caught up with a detective named Angela, who believes her sister Isabel didn't commit suicide and wants John to investigate as to why she killed herself. While this is going on, John finds out that full-fledged demons are entering the Earth when they are not permitted to and breaking the rules and now they're after him and Angela. While this is going on, a man armed with the Spear of Destiny (A spear that it Catholic beliefs killed Jesus when it pierced his side and not the crucifixion) is traveling to Los Angeles where most of the story takes place because he is possessed and as he goes along, kills animals and makes people become demon-possessed. Now John and Angela must find out what is going on both sides and why this is happening. Unfortunately, the story gets confusing and becomes difficult to follow; the lowest point of the film.MUSIC: The musical score in this film is quite good and knows how to set the mood.ACTING: Although some people complain about Keanu Reeves's (The Matrix trilogy, Speed) acting, I didn't think he was bad in this film or any other film he's been in. Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, Enemy at the Gates) has generally always been a good actress and there's no exception here. The rest of the actors were pretty good as well; except Shia LaBeouf, his character; Chazz; was just annoying as hell. The actors overall did a good job, even if the story and some parts of their dialogue were somewhat muddled.ACTION: This is where the film shines. The action scenes were generally pretty good, coupled with some of the best CGI effects you'll ever see in a film and this film gives one of the most interesting perspectives on what Hell looks like and it's quite creepy and frightening. This film has a number of clever weapon designs like the shotgun that fires ammo from golden shells made from melted crucifixes. The action scenes could be explosive and even has touches of gore. Nicely done.OVERALL: This film might offend anyone who is overly religious and they will probably claim this film to be Satanic. Those who aren't so overly touchy about religion should not be offended. If you like action flicks with an interesting twist, Constantine is definitely worth a look even if the storyline stumbles. This is indeed one of the better comic book-based films around.THE GOOD: Amazing CGI, cool actions, good acting, good music, and an interesting storyline.THE BAD: Storyline is confusing, the film can run into some moments of boredom, and Shia LaBeouf.",4,A COOL COMIC BOOK FLICK  8.5 OUT OF 10,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,3078,"['generally', 'hate', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'suck', 'miserably', 'Aside', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Hellboy', 'pretty', 'much', 'hate', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'got', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'critics', 'moviegoers', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'believe', 'be', 'underappreciated.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'story', 'John', 'Constantine', 'chain-smoking', 'pissed', 'off', 'exorcist', 'who', 'been', 'barred', 'gates', 'Heaven', 'must', 'do', 'God', 'work', 'deporting', 'half-breed', 'demons', 'Part', 'human', 'part', 'demon', 'who', 'break', 'rules', 'back', 'Hell', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'detective', 'named', 'Angela', 'who', 'sister', 'Isabel', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'suicide', 'John', 'investigate', 'why', 'killed', 'going', 'John', 'out', 'full-fledged', 'demons', 'are', 'entering', 'Earth', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'permitted', 'breaking', 'rules', 'now', ""'re"", 'Angela', 'going', 'man', 'armed', 'Spear', 'Destiny', 'spear', 'Catholic', 'killed', 'Jesus', 'when', 'pierced', 'side', 'not', 'crucifixion', 'traveling', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'most', 'story', 'place', 'possessed', 'along', 'kills', 'animals', 'people', 'become', 'demon-possessed', 'Now', 'John', 'Angela', 'must', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'sides', 'why', 'happening', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'confusing', 'difficult', 'follow', 'lowest', 'point', 'film.MUSIC', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'how', 'set', 'mood.ACTING', 'people', 'complain', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Matrix', 'trilogy', 'Speed', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'bad', 'film', 'other', 'film', 'been', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Mummy', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'Enemy', 'Gates', 'generally', 'always', 'been', 'good', 'actress', 'exception', 'here', 'rest', 'actors', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'well', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'character', 'Chazz', 'was', 'just', 'annoying', 'as', 'hell', 'actors', 'overall', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'even', 'story', 'parts', 'dialogue', 'were', 'somewhat', 'muddled.ACTION', 'where', 'film', 'shines', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'generally', 'pretty', 'good', 'coupled', 'best', 'CGI', 'effects', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'film', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'perspectives', 'what', 'Hell', 'quite', 'creepy', 'frightening', 'film', 'number', 'clever', 'weapon', 'designs', 'shotgun', 'ammo', 'golden', 'shells', 'made', 'melted', 'crucifixes', 'action', 'scenes', 'could', 'be', 'explosive', 'even', 'touches', 'gore', 'Nicely', 'done.OVERALL', 'film', 'might', 'offend', 'anyone', 'who', 'overly', 'religious', 'will', 'probably', 'claim', 'film', 'be', 'Satanic', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'overly', 'touchy', 'religion', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'offended', 'like', 'action', 'flicks', 'interesting', 'twist', 'Constantine', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'even', 'storyline', 'indeed', 'one', 'better', 'comic', 'book-based', 'films', 'around.THE', 'GOOD', 'Amazing', 'CGI', 'cool', 'actions', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'music', 'interesting', 'storyline.THE', 'BAD', 'Storyline', 'confusing', 'film', 'can', 'run', 'moments', 'boredom', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf']",Constantine

You know, the slim black tie, white collared shirt and black suit. The Matrix, Johnny Pneumonic (Oh cmon..it was pretty good) and now Constantine. His best characters have been ""Okay, stand there and look cool but don't say a whole lot"". His character is an anti-hero. He's a chain smoking self-absorbed demon hunter who thinks if he kills enough of hell's army on earth then he will be accepted into heaven. He has died once already for a brief time and knows he is going back to hell. Throw in the fact he has lung cancer and you have the character's motivation.The basic premise is Heaven vs. Hell. It's based upon a DC comic series (Comic is included) and Heaven is competing with Hell for souls. Enter Keanu's character. The story was actually very well done. I did not see this in theatres because I thought it was going to be a cheesy ""Matrix in Hell"" movie. It was actually really good, the special effects were nicely placed and the supporting cast were really good.

907316,A3TMC106MIY8S5,B0009KA7BS,A. Edward Azad,"[1, 3]","Putting aside the cheap Keanu jokes, this is his best film of this past decade. The Matrix? Pfft. Yes, I've seen The Lake House, and Something's Gotta Give, and A Scanner Darkly (actually, never finished it), and none of them boast a Keanu performance that can be honestly called 'essential'. He's good, but passable.Surprising, then, that a superhero movie based on an iconic, blond, *English* demonslayer would end up one of Reeves' definitive roles. He nails the jerkiness and been-there-done-that attitude of the character perfectly. (I would have thought James Marsters would be a better fit. Who knew?)Anyone who has seen End of Days will see similarities here. Between the two, I prefer Constantine, if only because the female lead (Rachael Weisz) isn't annoyingly weak in this one. Granted, Angela still finds herself in peril, but at least she isn't a jittery mess, unlike Robin Tunney who had to be dragged place to place by Arnold for the whole movie.The film wouldn't be half the success it is without the dual performances of Tilda Swinton and Peter Stormare as the archangel Gabriel and Satan, respectively. Stormare is supposed to be a surprise, but his version of Satan is already fairly well-known, even if the movie itself is underrated. It just proves that with awesome actors, even such well-trodden ground as a biblical action thriller can be spun in an original direction.",5,Hey cynics: worth a look,1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,1394,"['Putting', 'aside', 'cheap', 'Keanu', 'jokes', 'best', 'film', 'past', 'decade', 'Matrix', 'Pfft', 'Yes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Lake', 'House', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'actually', 'never', 'finished', 'none', 'boast', 'Keanu', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'honestly', 'called', ""'essential"", 'good', 'passable.Surprising', 'then', 'superhero', 'movie', 'based', 'iconic', 'blond', '*English*', 'demonslayer', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'one', 'Reeves', 'definitive', 'roles', 'jerkiness', 'been-there-done-that', 'attitude', 'character', 'perfectly', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'James', 'Marsters', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'fit', 'Who', 'knew', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'End', 'Days', 'will', 'see', 'similarities', 'here', 'two', 'prefer', 'Constantine', 'only', 'female', 'lead', 'Rachael', 'Weisz', ""n't"", 'annoyingly', 'weak', 'one', 'Granted', 'Angela', 'still', 'peril', 'least', ""n't"", 'jittery', 'mess', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'who', 'had', 'be', 'dragged', 'place', 'place', 'Arnold', 'whole', 'movie.The', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'success', 'dual', 'performances', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'archangel', 'Gabriel', 'Satan', 'respectively', 'Stormare', 'supposed', 'be', 'surprise', 'version', 'Satan', 'already', 'fairly', 'well-known', 'even', 'movie', 'underrated', 'just', 'awesome', 'actors', 'even', 'such', 'well-trodden', 'ground', 'biblical', 'action', 'thriller', 'can', 'be', 'spun', 'original', 'direction']",Constantine
907317,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B0009KA7BS,A. Estes,"[4, 5]","Based on the comic book, ""Hellblazer,"" ""Constantine"" tells the story of John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), a demon-hunter with special abilities who travels the country performing exorcisms and trying to get on God's good graces before he faces eternal damnation. It is established early on that he has a terminal illness, so the movie turns into a race against time. When Constantine teams up with a policewoman by the name of Angela (Rachel Weisz) whose identical twin sister may or may have not committed suicide, he sees one more chance for redemption. Following up his successful stint in the ""Matrix"" trilogy, Keanu handles the character effortlessly. I'm not too familiar with the comics, but in my head, he nailed the part. I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role (rumors say Nicholas Cage was originally set to play it...ugh). Rachel Weisz and her character compliment the character of ""Constantine"" and gives us something to be sympathetic too (she also looks great in a wet shirt). Alongside the two, the movie also co-stars Mr. Gwen Stefani himself, Gavin Rossdale (who is actually really good in this movie), Shia ""Even Stevens"" Lebeouf and Peter Stormare, who seems to have a little too much fun in the role of Satan. ""Constantine"" is full to the brim with disturbing images and arresting action sequences, as promised by the previews. No doubt, it's a pretty intense and involving movie. First time feature film director Francis Lawrence (whom, prior to this only handled music videos) shows us what he's made of and handles the movie effortlessly, with the skill of a director with much more experience. My main complaint with the movie though, is that the pace seems to be a bit chunky. Everytime a big action scene comes along, and you start to get focused on the material, it stops and we all unwind for about 20 minutes. The movie just doesn't seem to take off. It's good, no doubt, but it has that terminal flaw. It's hard to get into all the action when we keep getting relieved. It's still an exciting movie, and probably the best you're gonna see this time of year. It's got a bit of horror, a bit of black comedy, and a lot of action.

907319,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0009KA7BS,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[74, 86]","Dreadfully flawed and with a muddled story line, ""Constantine"" is nevertheless worth watching, for its occasional profound and intense beauty, and its visions of hell and its denizens, which anyone who believes that forces of evil exist and influence our world will find fascinating. Loosely based on characters from the Hellblazer comics, the script is very interesting in parts, but the audio is abysmal. The dialog sounds as if it is coming from an underwater tunnel, and I had to watch the film with subtitles. Also, this is a film that begs to be seen several times, to make some sense of the muddle.The cast is excellent, and I have always been partial to Keanu Reeves, who as John Constantine, a man dying of lung cancer, who can see, and has walked beyond this dimension, is very good in his own peculiar way. I can't imagine anyone else of his generation playing the part. As he says of the cat in the film, he's ""half in, half out,"" and Reeves also has that quality, of being in the world, but not quite of it. Rachel Weisz, who teamed with Reeves in the far less interesting 1996 ""Chain Reaction,"" is both Angela, a Los Angeles detective, and her twin sister Isabel. She looks gorgeous, and gives a sensitive, lovely performance. Others in the cast that stand out are Tilda Swinton as Gabriel, and Shia LaBeouf, as Chas, Constantine's eager apprentice.This is the feature directorial debut of Francis Lawrence, who has previously done music videos, and he certainly has an eye for bizarre imagery. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is terrific, and much of what is worthwhile in this film is due to him. It is hard to rate this film, as it is, like the battle of good and evil in the story, a mixture of opposites. Total running time is 121 minutes, it is rated R for ""violence and demonic images,"" but is comparatively mild in language and has no in-between the sheets action.

In the comic, Constantine is a foul-mouthed, beer swilling, two pack a day smoking, dirt bag of a blonde Brit. In the movie, he's Keanu Reeves. Why the producers behind this film would select a none-to-well known character like John Constantine, and then proceed to virtually dump all pre-existing character information about him, is beyond me. In my mind, you pick an established character for either the name recognition (capitalizing on a built in audience) or because that character is such a great one (in which you keep very close to the source material). Constantine chooses to eschew both these alternatives and instead goes for the dubious `let's totally change a character that nobody knows just to piss off the ones that do know' approach. And they do so successfully. While my unwitting cohorts were dazzled enough by the now expected veneer of special effects and thrown together artifact-related plot to at least not hate it, I found myself stupidly wondering at the terrible loss of potential.Tilda Swinton is great fun to watch as the archangel Gabriel, and Peter Stormare does his best to deliver some pretty bad material as Satan. Otherwise, the cast is flat and unmotivated. The plot circles around a special dagger that can somehow unleash the son of Satan into the world that otherwise only allows half demons and half angels. Needless to say, Constantine saves the day, and indirectly, himself from eternal damnation. If you are a fan of the comic, do not see this adaptation under any circumstance. If you are not a fan, then there's really no reason to see it unless you just really like Keanu Reeves.

He's a man on a mystical mission armed to his nicotine stained teeth with gold crucifix guns, chattering fright beetles and enough holy water to float even the Vatican for a month. Despite his laudable focus on ridding our Earthly plane of the foul miscreants, Constantine isn't a very likeable guy. He's not a noble priest exorcising a pea soup swilling teen of evil nor a sunny cheerleader who stakes Vampires. Constantine prowls the streets as a tortured, demon bedding, chain smoking rude guy who pretty much doesn't care anymore, because he really shouldn't even be here. His supernatural gifts are firmly tied up with his secret past, and those decisions both haunt him and drive him forward all at the same time.Keanu Reeves is again the ""chosen one"", and trades in his Matrix sunglasses and black trench coat for cigarettes and a black suit.  Fans of his from the Matrix movies can't get away from the feel that this is Neo battling demonic forces instead of cybernetic ones.  However, Reeves performance is meatier and more confident and the ""whoa"" factor of his Bill & Ted days is thankfully missing here.  He may never win an Oscar, but he's a decent enough actor and likable enough to get him over the rough spots.  Rachel Weitz shines in a dual role and her depth as an actress is developing nicely.  Art design and the visuals effects in this film are stunningly beautiful.  When used judiciously and to serve the story, digital effects don't have to make a film look like an expensive video game and Constantine's visual FX crew should be praised.  We've seen glimpses of Heaven & Hell many times in movies and here they've been reworked yet again and effectively so.Think of Constantine as a pumped up, action laden FX driven version of The Exorcist.  This film undoubtedly will never attain that classic level, however the philosophical issues of good and evil and heaven and hell are played here with the right mixture of seriousness and entertainment to satisfy any horror fan who likes films dealing in matters of biblical proportions.",4,"Decadently dashing, but decidedly doomed Demon Destroyer.",1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,2177,"['John', 'Constantine', 'demons.He', 'argues', 'hell', 'oh', 'yes', 'occasionally', 'even', 'sleeps', 'man', 'mystical', 'mission', 'armed', 'nicotine', 'stained', 'teeth', 'gold', 'crucifix', 'guns', 'chattering', 'fright', 'beetles', 'enough', 'holy', 'water', 'float', 'even', 'Vatican', 'month', 'laudable', 'focus', 'ridding', 'Earthly', 'plane', 'foul', 'miscreants', 'Constantine', ""n't"", 'very', 'likeable', 'guy', 'not', 'noble', 'priest', 'exorcising', 'pea', 'soup', 'swilling', 'teen', 'evil', 'sunny', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'Vampires', 'Constantine', 'streets', 'tortured', 'demon', 'bedding', 'chain', 'smoking', 'rude', 'guy', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'here', 'supernatural', 'gifts', 'are', 'firmly', 'tied', 'up', 'secret', 'past', 'decisions', 'haunt', 'drive', 'forward', 'same', 'time.Keanu', 'Reeves', 'again', 'chosen', 'one', 'trades', 'Matrix', 'sunglasses', 'black', 'trench', 'coat', 'cigarettes', 'black', 'suit', 'Fans', 'Matrix', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'feel', 'Neo', 'battling', 'demonic', 'forces', 'instead', 'cybernetic', 'ones', 'However', 'Reeves', 'performance', 'meatier', 'more', 'confident', 'whoa', 'factor', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'days', 'thankfully', 'missing', 'here', 'may', 'never', 'win', 'Oscar', 'decent', 'enough', 'actor', 'likable', 'enough', 'get', 'rough', 'spots', 'Rachel', 'Weitz', 'shines', 'dual', 'role', 'depth', 'actress', 'developing', 'nicely', 'Art', 'design', 'visuals', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'When', 'used', 'judiciously', 'serve', 'story', 'digital', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'expensive', 'video', 'game', 'Constantine', 'visual', 'FX', 'crew', 'should', 'be', 'praised', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'glimpses', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'many', 'times', 'movies', 'here', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reworked', 'yet', 'again', 'effectively', 'so.Think', 'Constantine', 'pumped', 'up', 'action', 'laden', 'FX', 'version', 'Exorcist', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'will', 'never', 'attain', 'classic', 'level', 'however', 'philosophical', 'issues', 'good', 'evil', 'heaven', 'hell', 'are', 'played', 'here', 'right', 'mixture', 'seriousness', 'entertainment', 'satisfy', 'horror', 'fan', 'who', 'films', 'dealing', 'matters', 'biblical', 'proportions']",Constantine

I mean, Keanu Reeves had already established himself as a great actor in The Matrix trilogy, while of course Rachel Weisz was the main reason that many people went to see the movie in the first place.  It was a great movie; I loved it.Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, an ex-cop who believes that he is the only one who can stop an invasion of demons from taking over the world- and it helps that he can actually see the demons.  This movie contains a lot of supernatural material, the main reason why I saw this movie in the first place (besides Rachel Weisz, of course), seeing as I love supernatural thrillers.Constantine's main focus is on helping skeptical policewoman Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) to solve the mysterious suicide of her twin sister (also played by Weisz), and their investigation takes them through the world of demons and angels that exists just beneath the landscape of contemporary Los Angeles. Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldy events, the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost. Constantine takes many trips to hell and back by going through a body of standing water (i.e. his bathtub, a pan of water).  There are also many sequences of demonic activity and language that almost makes a sailor blush, but I still loved this movie.Once again, I complain that Amazon's review system only goes up to 5 stars; otherwise, this would be much higher-rated.

It just won't happen.  It gets annoying hearing ""But in the comic it went like this..."" over and over again.  Get over it already.  Now, on to the movie...I went into 'Constantine' not expecting a whole lot.  I really don't like Keanu Reeves very much.  I think of him as basically an mannequin who can talk but he's actually fine here as the lead.  But I thought the premise of the film(yes fanboys, based on the comic 'Hellblazer')sounded interesting.  After watching the film, I was pleasantly surprised with it.  There was plenty of stylish action scenes that are very well done.  But the reason to see 'Constantine' is for the special effects.  They are absolutely amazing, some of the best I think I've ever seen, especially the shootout near the end of the film.  They are seamless.  As for the rest of the film: none of the acting was really that great nor was it terrible, but this is a comic book movie so I wasn't really expecting it to be Oscar caliber.  They do a workman-like job and don't drag the movie down at all.  And the script is pretty well done.  There's no real slow points and there's not any cheesy dialogue, which seems to plague comic book adaptions.Overall, 'Constantine' has an interesting little religious plot, good action scenes, some comic relief, and super-fabulous special effects.

Of course, Constantine had the film noir going on, but it's too pretentious in trying to be a pastiche in that genre. It would be nice to have a good movie that will literally focus on the meat of the story and try to develop that while having the quality of the acting, but it turns out that Constantine is an excuse, as the rest of my films released after the year 2000, to display very boring and overblown computer graphics. Come on, I want a story, not an abuse on my eyes. `3' was given for trying decently enough to get the story going, but lost points for being a waste of time. I feel like I am watching a rehash of The Matrix in The Exorcist disguise. Any time of the day, I would watch The Exorcist or The Omen over Constantine. Why? Because it was about the story.

Only this time there is no coherent plot.Start with a story so utterly illogical that even attempted explanations by other viewers (each had a different take) failed to break the puzzle...what in the world was it about?  Reeves, the Buddhist, as a wayward exorcist was about as believable as Howdy Doody in the role of Einstein. Some of the scenes were so embarrassing I actually cringed and can imagine the number of takes it took to complete without laughter.Is it God vs Satan, God's son vs Satan's son, demons vs angels or ""half breeds"" vs people? The film suggest a combination of each. Try to forget the androgynous Saint Michael, a closet nutcase? Same for Mr. Voodoo, the young assistant (who is killed off in the end) or the worst actor in history, the phony priest.  His death scene evoked gales of laughter.  Nothing makes sense - the suicides, ""seeing things"", the visits to Hell (lifted out of the Terminator), the ""secret"" underground world is about as hidden as a full moon.

907346,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,B0009KA7BS,Beau Yarbrough,"[1, 2]","Let me say this up-front: I'm a huge fan of the ""Hellblazer"" comic book, especially the long run by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon. So I was more than a little nervous about this movie. But at the same time, I also like films like this, even when they're not connected to any existing franchise.""Constantine"" feels like it both took too little from the comic books and not enough, which is a neat trick. There's likely a heck of a good movie on the cutting room floor or, more likely, in previous versions of the scripts that were sliced and spliced together to make the theatrical version of the film.Keanu Reeves plays LA detective John Constantine or, as he says it, ""John Constantine, a-hole."" That's a cute line, but it points to one of the major problems with the film: It's Schwarzeneggerized. Dialogue in the movie, for the most part, consists of clever catch phrases (and we know ""John Constantine, a-hole"" is a catch phrase because a riff is done on it by another character within the first minute of Reeves saying it in the movie). Is he an a-hole? Hard to tell: In the comics, he certainly is -- John Constantine in ""Hellblazer"" will sacrifice small children to save a city, or sell someone else's soul for a marginally improved chance of defeating an enemy. In the film, Reeves' Constantine is mostly just moody, but we never heard him say ""I'm Neo, a-hole"" or ""I'm either Bill or Ted, a-hole"" in previous movies, despite his Constantine not being dramatically different from any of his other roles. But it's a cute line, so we're stuck with it.In the comics, these clever bits that Constantine says are spaced out over several issues and we see a lot more of his street level grungy street magic. He's not a cool guy, he's a failed human being who happens to pull a rabbit out of his hat and save the day, once in a while, but at great cost to everyone around him. In the movie, we get all the cool bits and none of the context. This is Neo in wool instead of leather and using magic instead of virtual reality.Likewise, the story, involving the Devil's son, angels and demons involved in a cold war on Earth and twin psychics, is very authentically ""Hellblazer"" -- specifically, it hits a lot of the moments in the Ennis/Dillon run -- but where it should explain, it skims and where it should move quickly, it broods on arty sequences. As a result, the actual plot of the movie comes suddenly at the end, and it feels as though most of what came before was unneeded, and it probably was.Having said that, the film looks like a million bucks, whether it's cinematography, special effects or costuming. You can certainly see where they spent the money they saved on having a solid script doctor come in and clean things up afterwards.Those interested in the subject matter -- a war between Heaven and Hell in a modern urban landscape -- would be better advised to pick up the Ennis/Dillon ""Hellblazer"" paperbacks (all of which are available here at Amazon) instead.

907358,A1TR0WPC93BEC8,B0009KA7BS,"Brendan L. Agnew ""rothwyn""","[3, 5]","""Cats are good. Half-in, half-out anyway.""For fans of theological thrillers or graphic novels, there is something incredibly enticing about the character and adventures of John Constantine in the cult favorite comic Hellblazer. Seen by some as a powerful magician fighting against demons, and by others as a smarmy con-man out for a quick buck, the world behind the world that he inhabits is one ripe for a good mystery with a healthy dose of the bizarre.The movie adaptation helmed by director Francis Lawrence and starring Keanu Reeves is more of an extrapolation of some of Constantine's comic adventures rather than an adaptation of the exact world and character. John Constantine is now a dark-haired american living in a demon-infested Los Angeles (mmmm, irony) instead of the snarky blond Brit that rowls the comic pages. However, the important things about his character remain largely unchanged. He retains the same pitch-black sense of humor and ""screw you"" attitude to the minions of both heaven and hell, and Keanu himself does an admirable job in the role. Perhaps it's just that John Constantine can be such an emotionally dead character, but Keanu does what is easily his best work since donning his trenchcoat and shades in the original Matrix.The story for John is fairly simple; he sees dead people. Or rather, John Constantine has the rare ability to spot the semi-demons and quasi-angels (termed ""half-breeds"") that live among the human population. As a child, it drove him insane and desperate to the point attempted suicide. However, it didn't quite work, and now, knowing that he's destined to burn, Constantine acts as something of a bouncer for the city; whenever a demon tips the balance between good and evil by stepping too far outside the line, he deports them back to hell. he does this not for the sake of doing good, but in the forlorn hope that it'll buy him back into the good book.This grabs the attention of Racheal Dobs, a detective who can't believe that her Catholic sister would comit suicide. Suspecting foul play, she enlists the unwilling help of Constantine, and the two start down a road to unravel an unholy mystery involving the Spear of Destiny, psychic powers, and ancient prophecies.The story for the film is solid enough, but it's really the visual style and the supporting cast that make it enjoyable. Francis Lawrence creates a brilliant atmosphere for the film, along with some geniunely disturbing images of Hell, and does a great job of fitting each scene to its mood, whether it's being defined by performances or music.As for the supporting cast, they're all incredibly enjoyable. Gavin Rosdale and Tilda Swinton provide great contrast as Balthazar and Gabriel, and Djimon Honsou does a great mystery man as the militantly neutral Pappa Midnight. Even the usually annoying Shia LeBeouf is palatable, and in actually adds a lot to the character of John Constantine. As author Niel Gaiman proved in The Books of Magic, Constantine is most enjoyable to watch when he has a young charge to act as his foil. And watch for a scene-stealing performance from Peter Stormare as the Morning Star himself.Overall, the film isn't meant to be much more than an exercise in entertaiment with a heavy dose of the macabre, but it manages to be very good at what it does. With very effective use of effects and visual style, along with solid performances, if you like your supernatural thrillers with a touch of the hellish, this is where you should look.And the two-disk DVD is easily the best deal if you're planning on picking the film up.

907364,A3JOEIC2MFT1Z3,B0009KA7BS,Carol Mello,"[0, 0]","Random thoughts on this movie...response to other reviews...On Keanu Reeves: I went to see this movie because I am a Keanu Reeves fan and I enjoy him most in his action/fantasy movie roles than in his attempts at straight drama. While this movie is not as enjoyable as a ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" or a ""Matrix"", it is not the hopeless mess that so many Amazon reviewers have indicated. It is a solid 3 star (mid-range) movie.  It is a must-see and perhaps must-have for Keanu Reeves fans.  I might not watch this movie over and over again as I have watched the ""Matrix"" and ""Bill & Ted"" but I will definitely watch it again.On the movie genre: I am not an expert on nor a die-hard fan of this movie genre. So my rating of this movie is intended for people who are not fans/experts on this genre, just ordinary movie goers like me. The antecedents of this movie -- that it is based on a comic book series -- are clear. Where else would such an arcane plot come from except the panels of a comic book? I like the fact that this movie does not take itself too seriously.  The movie is not produced with the extremely polished block-buster values of a ""Batman"" or ""Spiderman"" movie. I have no problem with that. Some movies with tons of money put into production become overly-polished and bland (the equivalent of waxed apples). I like my fruit and movies unwaxed.On offensiveness to Catholics/Christians: No real Catholics or Christians were harmed in the making of this movie. The intent of the movie is neither earnest (e.g. ""Jesus Camp"") nor satiric (e.g. Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"" or ""South Park""). Its usage of the Catholic religion is a plot device only, a prop. I could detect no statements, negative or positive, about real religion in the movie. Nothing in this movie will cause a Christian to become an atheist. That said, I will state the obvious: this movie is inappropriate for impressionable and/or sensitive children (younger than 10), regardless of their religious upbringing. It is the kind of movie that would have given me nightmares as a child. (I have amended my review to add the preceding caution statement because I am always surprised at the age of children brought to some movies by their parents. What are those parents thinking? Are they crazy?)On why 3 stars: I would not have chosen to watch this movie if Keanu Reeves had not been in it. The biggest downfall of this movie is the script. There are no memorable scenes in the movie until the end. It was boring for short periods. The boring parts were never long enough for me to lose interest completely.  (I will not finish watching a thoroughly boring movie even if Keanu Reeves is the star.)Another movie in which Satan attempts to take over the world, comedy, non-comic book: Kevin Smith's ""Dogma"", solid 4 star movie, starring Ben Affleck, Matt Damon.Dogma (Special Edition)",3,enjoyable movie for Keanu Reeves fans,1194393600,"11 7, 2007",2007,2872,"['Random', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'response', 'other', 'reviews', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'am', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'most', 'action/fantasy', 'movie', 'roles', 'attempts', 'straight', 'drama', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'Excellent', 'Adventure', 'Matrix', 'not', 'hopeless', 'mess', 'so', 'many', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'have', 'indicated', 'solid', '3', 'star', 'mid-range', 'movie', 'must-see', 'perhaps', 'must-have', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'fans', 'might', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'over', 'again', 'have', 'watched', 'Matrix', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'again.On', 'movie', 'genre', 'am', 'not', 'expert', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'movie', 'genre', 'rating', 'movie', 'intended', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'fans/experts', 'genre', 'just', 'ordinary', 'movie', 'goers', 'antecedents', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'are', 'clear', 'Where', 'else', 'would', 'such', 'arcane', 'plot', 'come', 'panels', 'comic', 'book', 'fact', 'movie', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'movie', 'not', 'produced', 'extremely', 'polished', 'block-buster', 'values', 'Batman', 'Spiderman', 'movie', 'have', 'problem', 'movies', 'tons', 'money', 'put', 'production', 'become', 'overly-polished', 'bland', 'equivalent', 'waxed', 'apples', 'fruit', 'movies', 'unwaxed.On', 'offensiveness', 'Catholics/Christians', 'real', 'Catholics', 'Christians', 'were', 'harmed', 'making', 'movie', 'intent', 'movie', 'earnest', 'e.g', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'satiric', 'e.g', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Life', 'Brian', 'South', 'Park', 'usage', 'Catholic', 'religion', 'plot', 'device', 'only', 'prop', 'could', 'detect', 'statements', 'negative', 'positive', 'about', 'real', 'religion', 'movie', 'Nothing', 'movie', 'will', 'cause', 'Christian', 'become', 'atheist', 'said', 'will', 'state', 'obvious', 'movie', 'inappropriate', 'impressionable', 'and/or', 'sensitive', 'children', 'younger', '10', 'regardless', 'religious', 'upbringing', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'child', 'have', 'amended', 'review', 'add', 'preceding', 'caution', 'statement', 'am', 'always', 'surprised', 'age', 'children', 'brought', 'movies', 'parents', 'What', 'are', 'parents', 'thinking', 'Are', 'crazy', 'why', '3', 'stars', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'chosen', 'watch', 'movie', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'biggest', 'downfall', 'movie', 'script', 'are', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'movie', 'end', 'was', 'boring', 'short', 'periods', 'boring', 'parts', 'were', 'never', 'long', 'enough', 'lose', 'interest', 'completely', 'will', 'not', 'finish', 'watching', 'thoroughly', 'boring', 'movie', 'even', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'star', 'movie', 'Satan', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'comedy', 'non-comic', 'book', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Dogma', 'solid', '4', 'star', 'movie', 'starring', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Matt', 'Damon.Dogma', 'Special', 'Edition']",Constantine

I didn't like the Gabriel role or the person who played Satan.  I LOVED that fact that once again Gavin Rossdale was in a movie-and he pulled off his part well to but seemed to be stretching also.  It just felt forced acting from ALL the actors and actresses.  But, the plot was good and the special effects rocked!  So I look over the acting.  I personally wonder if many people don't like the movie because it relies heavily on religion and you may start to debate your own faith?!

Hollywood doesn't undertand religion, nevermind the Occult. And the Hellblazer comics are about the occult, black magic and neo-Paganism. Perhaps Hollywood didn't think America was ready for that, but more likely the hacks who write this kind of crap can't wrap their shrivelled brains around it.  Hellblazer's universe- excuse me, Constantine's universe- is spitefully amoral and unconcerned with sin and redemption and all the other hand-me-down theology that we are forced to sit through in equally terrible movies like the Order and Lost Souls. The Hellblazer comics are about people and non-people misusing their powers to bad ends, and the stories usually have messy, inconclusive finishes. One of my favorites was when Constantine, who was haunted by an murdered ex-girlfriend, punished her killer by loading him up on LSD and locking him in a box with a rotting corpse. This nonsense about running around with a shotgun shaped like a crucifix and loaded with shells filled with holy water would have made the real Constantine die of laughter. It surely will make Hellblazer fans daydream about filling shotguns of their own and booking a flight to La-La land...Thirdly, the cast is mostly excellent but has nothing to do. Reeves is a good physical actor- it just all falls apart when he opens his mouth. He wisely underplays his dialog and the writers wisely don't give him much. I just wish they gave him a dye job. Actually I wish they gave Clive Owen a dye job and had him play the lead, but alas, Hollywood cares little about my wishes. Tilda Swinton is wasted- a stock British baddie so beloved of talentless Tinseltown hacks. Her storyline makes not even a lick of sense and when it is ""resolved"", you will scratch your head and say ""what the hell?"". Rachel Weisz is her usual charming self, but doesn't seem to know what to do with the convoluted storyline. Gavin Rossdale is very handsome and dashing and his character is a complete waste of space and does nothing to advance the story. Peter Stormare supplies some much needed comic relief in his role as Truman Capote playing Satan, but his dialog is terrible and the whole cosmology of the story is such a slap in the face to Hellblazer readers by the time he shows up you won't care. The rest of the performances are serviceable.Giving credit where it's due, the direction and cinematography are excellent, but the script, the script....This is a throwback to the bad old days of comic book adaptions when it was painfully clear that the film-makers had contempt for the source material and just made up their own stupid story.

907374,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0009KA7BS,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[1, 3]","A lot of people say Keanu Reeves can't act...a statement which, to me, isn't exactly true...I think he can act, but just that his abilities and range are limited to the point where most of his characters come off as being something someone carved out of wood (deadwood at that)...at the very least, he's still got his good looks to fall back on, and in world dominated by superficialities, that can take you far...disagree?  Then why are so many people interested in a vacuous, untalented void, with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever, named Paris Hilton?  Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh on Ms. Hilton, but I do so tire of constantly seeing her visage plastered over every stinking media outlet as if she's someone truly worthy of the attention...based on a DC/Vertigo comic book (or graphic novel, if you prefer) called Hellblazer, Constantine (2005) was adapted for the screen by Kevin Brodbin (The Glimmer Man) and directed by Francis Lawrence, whose previous credits are limited to a TV series called `Making the Video', a show that focuses on the actual making of music videos, which, to me, is about one step below those who actually direct music videos, but hey, we all have to start some place...starring in the movie is Keanu `Mr. Woodenhead' Reeves (The Devil's Advocate, The Matrix), along with the very attractive and talented Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, Beautiful Creatures).  Also appearing is Tilda Swinton (Vanilla Sky), whom often gets confused with actress Cate Blanchett, former lead singer from the band Bush Gavin Rossdale, crazy eyeball man Pruitt Taylor Vince (Monster), Max Baker (The Island), Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator), Shia LaBeouf (I, Robot), and Peter Stormare (Fargo, The Big Lebowski) as the embodiment of all that is evil, that's right, I'm talking about Satan...can you dig it?Keanu plays John Constantine, a chain smoking demon hunter, stuck between Heaven and Hell.  Apparently God and the Devil are engaged in a wager, with the souls of all mankind at stake, and since angels and demons can't cross onto our plane of reality, both sides use what's called half breeds to peddle influence, hoping to draw individuals one way or another.  When these half-breeds, specifically the ones from Hell (as you can figure, they're notorious cheaters), break the rules, Constantine deports them back to whence they came, sort of an immigration officer of the damned.  Recently Constantine has been noticing demonic activity above and beyond what he's used to, and it appears to be tied to the suicide death of the sister of a L.A. detective Angela Dodson, played by Weisz, who believes her devoutly Catholic sister who have never risked eternal damnation by doing so, and thereby must have been murdered.  Their paths eventually cross, and Constantine's contacts begin turning up dead (as they get too close to the answer), with signs indicating a possible shift in the fragile balance between good and evil is coming, one that could mean an end to the good times here on Earth.I think this movie is a great example of what happens when one focuses so much on all the little details, and not enough on the casting, expecting any old high profile name to fit the bill and tie it all together...namely in Reeves.  Now I've had the opportunity to read the original story way back when it came out in the Hellblazer comic book, and while I can't recall many of the details, I certainly had a good idea with regards to the character of Constantine, and Reeves just didn't fit the bill, no matter how much they tried to jam his square peg into the round hole.  His character displayed the cynical attitudes and sarcastic, sometimes caustic nature, but it didn't feel like it actually emanated from within Reeves but rather something he was trying to channel from the script.  At least Weisz was there to pick up some of the slack, but there was just too much for her to handle...and so little attention was given to the supporting characters so they were unable to help in that aspect.  Also, I thought the script was somewhat weak, as the dialog added very little life to the characters, with perhaps the exception of Weisz and Stormare, who were both relatively interesting to watch...also, the script and direction seemed to expect a lot of difficult intuitive assumptions from the audience, which often resulted in some confusing aspects that didn't necessarily get cleared up by the end of the story (the Spear of Destiny aspect, in particular).  In terms of the direction, I thought there were some great individual sequences, but when tied together, they didn't work as well as they could have.  The real strength of the film lies in the production design, bringing the special effects to life and merging them in with the real life elements.  They certainly provided a visually interesting and entertaining backdrop to the story, it's just too bad Reeves was chosen to be the focal point of the story as he just couldn't pull it off, or at least that's my opinion, which in the grand scheme of things counts for very little.  I've watch much of the extras in the `making of' featurettes, so I have some idea of the amount of work that went into developing the look and feel of the film, so I wanted to give those folks credit as they worked extremely hard and held up their end very well.  Would a different lead actor have made the difference?  It certainly would have helped a lot, as Keanu's performance only helped to exacerbate the relative weaknesses, specifically in the script, and to a lesser degree, in the direction.  Overall the film was fun and somewhat interesting, but hardly one anyone should rush out to see, especially die-hard fans of the source material, as they'll probably be disappointed the most given such a lack luster, high profile showing of such an interesting and complicated character...is it me, or, for those who read the storyline featured in this film, so much more surprising in the comic than in the film?  I suppose since I knew how it was going to end, the shock value was limited, but it just felt like it came off so much more effective in the comic...I won't bother going over the boat load of extras, as the Amazon website lists them in detail adequately enough, but they did help me appreciate the film a bit more than I did after I saw it...Cookieman108By the way, I did really like those holy brass knuckles...smiting evil was never so cool...",3,"""You're the one soul I would come up here to collect myself.""",1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,6421,"['lot', 'people', 'say', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'ca',

907375,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,B0009KA7BS,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[1, 3]","Loosely based upon the dark comic book and graphic novel series published byDC Comics/Vertigo, Constantine is a supernatural thriller with amazing visual effects, thrilling action, and a great cast. Unfortunately, the film's screenplay, which was written by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello, fails to capture the spirit of the books. Rather than keeping the characters as they are in the books, the writers have taken liberties that minimalize the effect of the story. In the books, John Constantine is a blond-haired British anti-hero. Here he's played by Keanu Reeves, with black hair and an American accent. Normally I wouldn't complain about such trivial details, but the character of Constantine is further changed from his comic book counterpart. This brings me to one of the film's greatest strengths; it's original and unafraid to make changes. Breaking away from many of the conventions found in the ""superhero"" genre, Constantine dares to be somber and politically incorrect. Can you name any other ""comic book"" film where the hero has cancer, is suicidal, and generally disliked by everyone that he associates with? Nope, I didn't think so.Demon hunter and exorcist, John Constantine has never been a popular guy, but his talents are in high demand. Constantine has the ability to see damned spirits and the knowledge necessary to send them back to Hell. The only problem is that he's a chain-smoking, cynical, selfish S.O.B. and he's just been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. When Constantine is contacted by detective Angela Dodson to investigate the apparent suicide of her twin sister, Constantine discovers a demonic conspiracy to bring about the apocalypse. Relying on a small group of demon hunters, occultists, and half-breeds (a term for Earth-bound angels and demons), Constantine wages a war against the Devil. But it's only a matter of time before his cancer overpowers him and the sins of his past decide his fate in the afterlife. Will John Constantine be sent to Hell for his misdeeds, or will the gates of Heaven part for this proud and defiant sinner? In the battle between two worlds, between Heaven and Hell, between all that's good and all that's evil, between the holy and the profane... John Constantine fights for the middle ground.The big budget action/thriller features an atypical cast, which with the exception of odd man out Keanu Reeves, fits the film's anarchic atmosphere perfectly. Though Keanu gives a fine performance, his looks and his mannerisms never seem right for the character, who was supposedly modeled after Clint Eastwood asDirty Harryand Sting, the lead singer of the Police. The cast includes Rachel Weisz as Angela and Isabel Dodson, Shia LaBeouf as Chas, Tilda Swinton as Gabriel, Djimon Honsou as Papa Midnite, Gavin Rossdale as Balthazar, and Peter Stormare as Satan. Each member of the diverse cast gives a worthy performance, but the standout here is indie film star Tilda Swinton, who plays the beatific and androgynous angel Gabriel with a delicious irony.As has often been the case with films based upon characters created by Alan Moore, Constantine became a showcase for the latest computer effects rather than focusing on the deeply flawed characters that made the books so successful.With the film's blasphemous overtones, it's no wonder that many religious groups were up in arms about the portrayal of Biblical figures. Still the film serves up about as much theological discussion as similarly ironic film RoboCop did for discussions about law enforcement, which is fine by me. Not every film needs to take itself so seriously and Constantine doesn't. Another flaw of the film is the direction, which feels both forced and mechanical in its execution. Directed by music video auteur Francis Lawrence, who focuses on creating a visually stunning but emotionally devoid alternate reality populated by all manner of miscreants and lost souls. If you're looking for a thought provoking film about redemption through spirituality, then Constantine will likely disappoint. But if what you seek is a fast-paced thriller with lots of action and witty dialogue, then Constantine is for you.Also recommended:Swamp Thing: The CurseHellblazer: Original SinsJohn Constantine, Hellblazer: Dangerous HabitsWar Lord John ConstantineThe Exorcist - The Complete AnthologyKolchak: The Night StalkerThe Ninth Gate",3,John Constantine: Hellblazer,1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,4372,"['Loosely', 'based', 'dark', 'comic', 'book', 'graphic', 'novel', 'series', 'published', 'Comics/Vertigo', 'Constantine', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'amazing', 'visual', 'effects', 'thrilling', 'action', 'great', 'cast', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Kevin', 'Brodbin', 'Frank', 'Cappello', 'capture', 'spirit', 'books', 'Rather', 'keeping', 'characters', 'are', 'books', 'writers', 'have', 'taken', 'liberties', 'minimalize', 'effect', 'story', 'books', 'John', 'Constantine', 'blond-haired', 'British', 'anti-hero', 'Here', 'played', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'black', 'hair', 'American', 'accent', 'Normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'complain', 'such', 'trivial', 'details', 'character', 'Constantine', 'further', 'changed', 'comic', 'book', 'counterpart', 'one', 'film', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'original', 'unafraid', 'make', 'changes', 'Breaking', 'away', 'many', 'conventions', 'found', 'superhero', 'genre', 'Constantine', 'be', 'somber', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'Can', 'name', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'where', 'hero', 'cancer', 'suicidal', 'generally', 'disliked', 'everyone', 'Nope', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.Demon', 'hunter', 'exorcist', 'John', 'Constantine', 'never', 'been', 'popular', 'guy', 'talents', 'are', 'high', 'demand', 'Constantine', 'ability', 'see', 'damned', 'spirits', 'knowledge', 'necessary', 'send', 'back', 'Hell', 'only', 'problem', 'chain-smoking', 'cynical', 'selfish', 'S.O.B', 'just', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'inoperable', 'lung', 'cancer', 'When', 'Constantine', 'contacted', 'detective', 'Angela', 'Dodson', 'investigate', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'twin', 'sister', 'Constantine', 'demonic', 'conspiracy', 'bring', 'about', 'apocalypse', 'Relying', 'small', 'group', 'demon', 'hunters', 'occultists', 'half-breeds', 'term', 'Earth-bound', 'angels', 'demons', 'Constantine', 'war', 'Devil', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'cancer', 'sins', 'past', 'decide', 'fate', 'afterlife', 'Will', 'John', 'Constantine', 'be', 'sent', 'Hell', 'misdeeds', 'will', 'gates', 'Heaven', 'part', 'proud', 'defiant', 'sinner', 'battle', 'two', 'worlds', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'good', 'evil', 'holy', 'profane', 'John', 'Constantine', 'fights', 'middle', 'ground.The', 'big', 'budget', 'action/thriller', 'atypical', 'cast', 'exception', 'odd', 'man', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'film', 'anarchic', 'atmosphere', 'perfectly', 'Keanu', 'fine', 'performance', 'looks', 'mannerisms', 'never', 'seem', 'right', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'supposedly', 'modeled', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'asDirty', 'Harryand', 'Sting', 'lead', 'singer', 'Police', 'cast', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Angela', 'Isabel', 'Dodson', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Chas', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Gabriel', 'Djimon', 'Honsou', 'Papa', 'Midnite', 'Gavin', 'Rossdale', 'Balthazar', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'Satan', 'member', 'diverse', 'cast', 'worthy', 'performance', 'standout', 'here', 'indie', 'film', 'star', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'who', 'beatific', 'androgynous', 'angel', 'Gabriel', 'delicious', 'irony.As', 'often', 'been', 'case', 'films', 'based', 'characters', 'created', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'Constantine', 'became', 'showcase', 'latest', 'computer', 'effects', 'rather', 'focusing', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'characters', 'made', 'books', 'successful.With', 'film', 'blasphemous', 'overtones', 'wonder', 'many', 'religious', 'groups', 'were', 'up', 'arms', 'portrayal', 'Biblical', 'figures', 'Still', 'film', 'up', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'theological', 'discussion', 'similarly', 'ironic', 'film', 'RoboCop', 'did', 'discussions', 'law', 'enforcement', 'fine', 'Not', 'film', 'take', 'so', 'seriously', 'Constantine', ""n't"", 'flaw', 'film', 'direction', 'forced', 'mechanical', 'execution', 'Directed', 'music', 'video', 'auteur', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'creating', 'visually', 'stunning', 'emotionally', 'devoid', 'alternate', 'reality', 'populated', 'manner', 'miscreants', 'lost', 'souls', ""'re"", 'looking', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'redemption', 'spirituality', 'then', 'Constantine', 'will', 'likely', 'disappoint', 'what', 'seek', 'fast-paced', 'thriller', 'lots', 'action', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'then', 'Constantine', 'you.Also', 'recommended', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'CurseHellblazer', 'Original', 'SinsJohn', 'Constantine', 'Hellblazer', 'Dangerous', 'HabitsWar', 'Lord', 'John', 'ConstantineThe', 'Exorcist', 'Complete', 'AnthologyKolchak', 'Night', 'StalkerThe', 'Ninth', 'Gate']",Constantine

One guy against big odds trying to find a way to win. In this case, it's one man versus Hell and Heaven (Hell mostly) trying to stop the end of the world. Doesn't get much bigger than that odds-wise. The main character has all kinds of flaws to overcome, and that makes you pull for him even more. The story is well told, but can be a little heavy on the obscure biblical dialogue. I found myself rewinding here and there to hear some of the more obscure points revealed in the story. This is a small complaint because the monologues do fit with the vibe of the story, so just think of them as added atmosphere. The effects are all excellently done, and the visual style is both creepy and beautiful in equal measure. This is a better film than many gave it credit for when it was released.

907381,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0009KA7BS,Cubist,"[2, 4]","Constantine marks the feature film debut of music video director Francis Lawrence who, judging by the look of this movie, would like to follow in the footsteps of David Fincher. For his first time out, Lawrence takes on the daunting task of adapting the excellent comic book, Hellblazer. Its main character, John Constantine first appeared in the pages of Swamp Thing, during an illustrious run by Alan Moore. Eventually, Constantine got his own series with the launch of DC Comics' Vertigo line. Jamie Delano was the primary writer and fleshed out the character's backstory, his friends (like Chas the cabbie) and family. These stories typified late `80s comic book horror and provided a bridge between Moore and the next creative heavyweight to tackle the character, Garth Ennis. His run on Hellblazer is where the movie gets most of its material from. Constantine is a chain-smoking, hard-drinking guy suffering from terminal lung cancer. He becomes embroiled in a complex war between Heaven and Hell with humanity caught in the middle.Fans of the comic book are probably not going to like this movie. Constantine is supposed to be world-weary, a sarcastic drunk and womanizer but Reeves doesn't quite pull it off. He presents a more sanitized version of the comic book character and even that feels forced. Another major betrayal of the character is having him wield a gun (a cool-looking crucifix shotgun), something that the Constantine of the comic would never do. Reeves is unable sell the character convincingly and is miscast in this role. Guy Pearce or Clive Owen would have been a much better choice to play Constantine.Despite the miscasting of Reeves and Weisz in the two main roles, Lawrence's take on Constantine is actually quite entertaining, even more so if you haven't read the comic book. However, fans of the series will have problems with the major liberties the filmmakers have taken with the characters - especially Constantine and Chas. Like most comic book adaptations, this film only sprinkles certain elements from the source material, just enough to vaguely resemble it while watering it down for mainstream consumption. It's a shame because in the right hands, Constantine could have been this year's Hellboy instead it's closer to the flawed, missed opportunity of The Punisher.On the first DVD there is an audio commentary by Francis Lawrence, producer Akiva Goldsman and screenwriters Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello. Lawrence does his best to keep on topic and actually comment on what we are watching while Goldsman does his best to come off as very annoying and unfunny.Also included is a music video for the song ""Passive"" by A Perfect Circle. It's pretty standard stuff with the band playing through distorted visuals with lots of clips from the movie.There is also the teaser and theatrical trailer.The catch phrase of the extras on second DVD is how everyone wanted to ""stay true to the spirit ""of the comic book. Everyone involved makes a point of defending the changes made from comic to film. ""Conjuring Constantine"" traces the character's origins from The Swamp Thing to Hellblazer. Not surprisingly, Alan Moore and Garth Ennis are not interviewed as I'm sure they'd have a few things to say about the liberal changes made.""The Production from Hell"" features Lawrence talking about the pressures of making his first feature film.""Imagining the Underworld"" takes a look at the film's version of Hell. Lawrence wanted it to resemble Los Angeles' highway after a nuclear bomb test explosion. Several other special effects set pieces are examined and shown how they were put together.""Constantine Cosmology"" examines the role mythology plays in the movie and how it compares to the heroic journey according to the writings of Joseph Campbell.""Foresight: The Power of Pre-Visualization"" shows how certain scenes were mapped out in terms of point-of-view, angles, and camera moves via computer animation with an optional audio commentary by Lawrence.Finally, there are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Lawrence. He talks about why they were cut, usually for reasons of pacing. A character from the comic book, Ellie the demon, was cut from the film and her scene is included.A nice touch with this deluxe edition is the inclusion of a mini-comic book that includes stories by Delano and Ennis.",3,Fans of the comic book will be disappointed,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,4348,"['Constantine', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'music', 'video', 'director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'judging', 'look', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'David', 'Fincher', 'first', 'time', 'out', 'Lawrence', 'daunting', 'task', 'adapting', 'excellent', 'comic', 'book', 'Hellblazer', 'main', 'character', 'John', 'Constantine', 'first', 'appeared', 'pages', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'illustrious', 'run', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'Eventually', 'Constantine', 'got', 'own', 'series', 'launch', 'DC', 'Comics', 'Vertigo', 'line', 'Jamie', 'Delano', 'was', 'primary', 'writer', 'fleshed', 'out', 'character', 'backstory', 'friends', 'Chas', 'cabbie', 'family', 'stories', 'typified', 'late', '80s', 'comic', 'book', 'horror', 'provided', 'bridge', 'Moore', 'next', 'creative', 'heavyweight', 'tackle', 'character', 'Garth', 'Ennis', 'run', 'Hellblazer', 'where', 'movie', 'most', 'material', 'Constantine', 'chain-smoking', 'hard-drinking', 'guy', 'suffering', 'terminal', 'lung', 'cancer', 'embroiled', 'complex', 'war', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'humanity', 'caught', 'middle.Fans', 'comic', 'book', 'are', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'like', 'movie', 'Constantine', 'supposed', 'be', 'world-weary', 'sarcastic', 'drunk', 'womanizer', 'Reeves', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', 'more', 'sanitized', 'version', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'even', 'feels', 'forced', 'major', 'betrayal', 'character', 'having', 'wield', 'gun', 'cool-looking', 'crucifix', 'shotgun', 'something', 'Constantine', 'comic', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'Reeves', 'unable', 'sell', 'character', 'convincingly', 'miscast', 'role', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'choice', 'play', 'Constantine.Despite', 'miscasting', 'Reeves', 'Weisz', 'two', 'main', 'roles', 'Lawrence', 'take', 'Constantine', 'actually', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'comic', 'book', 'However', 'fans', 'series', 'will', 'have', 'problems', 'major', 'liberties', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'taken', 'characters', 'especially', 'Constantine', 'Chas', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'film', 'only', 'certain', 'elements', 'source', 'material', 'just', 'enough', 'vaguely', 'resemble', 'watering', 'down', 'mainstream', 'consumption', 'shame', 'right', 'hands', 'Constantine', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'year', 'Hellboy', 'instead', 'closer', 'flawed', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'Punisher.On', 'first', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'producer', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'screenwriters', 'Kevin', 'Brodbin', 'Frank', 'Cappello', 'Lawrence', 'best', 'keep', 'topic', 'actually', 'comment', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'Goldsman', 'best', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'annoying', 'unfunny.Also', 'included', 'music', 'video', 'song', 'Passive', 'Perfect', 'Circle', 'pretty', 'standard', 'stuff', 'band', 'playing', 'distorted', 'visuals', 'lots', 'clips', 'movie.There', 'also', 'teaser', 'theatrical', 'trailer.The', 'catch', 'phrase', 'extras', 'second', 'DVD', 'how', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'stay', 'true', 'spirit', 'comic', 'book', 'Everyone', 'involved', 'point', 'defending', 'changes', 'made', 'comic', 'film', 'Conjuring', 'Constantine', 'character', 'origins', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'Hellblazer', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'Garth', 'Ennis', 'are', 'not', 'interviewed', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'have', 'few', 'things', 'say', 'liberal', 'changes', 'made', 'Production', 'Hell', 'Lawrence', 'talking', 'pressures', 'making', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'Imagining', 'Underworld', 'look', 'film', 'version', 'Hell', 'Lawrence', 'wanted', 'resemble', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'highway', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'test', 'explosion', 'Several', 'other', 'special', 'effects', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'examined', 'shown', 'how', 'were', 'put', 'together', 'Constantine', 'Cosmology', 'role', 'mythology', 'plays', 'movie', 'how', 'heroic', 'journey', 'according', 'writings', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'Foresight', 'Power', 'Pre-Visualization', 'how', 'certain', 'scenes', 'were', 'mapped', 'out', 'terms', 'point-of-view', 'angles', 'camera', 'moves', 'computer', 'animation', 'optional', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Lawrence.Finally', 'are', 'four', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Lawrence', 'why', 'were', 'cut', 'usually', 'reasons', 'pacing', 'character', 'comic', 'book', 'Ellie', 'demon', 'was', 'cut', 'film', 'scene', 'included.A', 'nice', 'touch', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'inclusion', 'mini-comic', 'book', 'stories', 'Delano', 'Ennis']",Constantine

And I must say that I rather enjoyed it for the most part.  Anything with angels and demons always interests me, and this film put a quirky spin on the agents of God and Lucifer.  Since John Constantine seems to be a pretty tight-lipped fellow who doesn't reveal much of himself to anyone, Keanu Reeves seems like a pretty good pick to play the part - there's not too much acting required for this one.So what's this all about?  Well, John Constantine has this gift (or curse) to see and interact with creatures from both heaven and hell; he's already been to hell and back once - literally - and therein lies his biggest problem.  Since he did commit suicide, he's not eligible for a ticket to heaven later on - and this second life he was given is hurtling toward an impending end thanks to all those cigarettes he's chain-smoked for years.  He's content to go his own moping way, dealing with particularly difficult exorcisms when called upon and generally just bemoaning his awful fate.  Then a female cop (Rachel Weisz) shows up asking for his help; her sister supposedly committed suicide, but she doesn't believe it.  Both Rachel and her sister were pretty special, for they could also see the things Constantine sees (although it takes some rather intense training for Constantine to reawaken those abilities in his new, temporary partner).  It soon seems obvious that something big is going down.  More and more demons are trying to cross into our world, violating a big treaty between God and Lucifer (who would have thought that demons couldn't be trusted?), and that just doesn't bode well for anybody.  Before you know it, special effects are coming at you left and right, and the birth of the Antichrist is almost at hand.Now, you're probably thinking that old Mr. Pitchfork himself is behind the whole Antichrist thing - but that ain't necessarily so.  The movie manages to throw in a couple of small surprises toward the end (although it certainly breaks no new ground in showing Lucifer as a really stupid being).  I really hated the characterization of the angel Gabriel, though.  First off, I just don't see Gabriel as a woman, but more importantly, this Gabriel comes across as a far from superior being.  This isn't the first time we've seen a Gabriel who hated and conspired against humans (out of jealousy), but Constantine's Gabriel is a far cry from a similar archangel in, for example, The Prophecy.The plot of this movie isn't all that bad, but it could have been told much more effectively.  If you're not into this kind of weird subject matter, you may look upon the story as little more than an excuse to throw some impressive special effects together.  I'm giving Constantine a somewhat tentative four stars, but I'm sure there are a good many people who won't enjoy the film very much at all.",4,"I enjoyed it, but I can see why a good many others wouldn't",1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,2961,"['have', 'familiarity', 'whatsoever', 'graphic', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'can', 'only', 'address', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'part', 'Anything', 'angels', 'demons', 'always', 'interests', 'film', 'put', 'quirky', 'spin', 'agents', 'God', 'Lucifer', 'John', 'Constantine', 'be', 'pretty', 'tight-lipped', 'fellow', 'who', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'much', 'anyone', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'pretty', 'good', 'pick', 'play', 'part', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'acting', 'required', 'what', 'Well', 'John', 'Constantine', 'gift', 'curse', 'see', 'interact', 'creatures', 'heaven', 'hell', 'already', 'been', 'hell', 'back', 'once', 'literally', 'therein', 'biggest', 'problem', 'did', 'commit', 'suicide', 'not', 'eligible', 'ticket', 'heaven', 'later', 'second', 'life', 'was', 'given', 'hurtling', 'impending', 'end', 'thanks', 'cigarettes', 'chain-smoked', 'years', 'content', 'go', 'own', 'moping', 'way', 'dealing', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'exorcisms', 'when', 'called', 'upon', 'generally', 'just', 'bemoaning', 'awful', 'fate', 'Then', 'female', 'cop', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'up', 'asking', 'help', 'sister', 'supposedly', 'committed', 'suicide', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Rachel', 'sister', 'were', 'pretty', 'special', 'could', 'also', 'see', 'things', 'Constantine', 'sees', 'rather', 'intense', 'training', 'Constantine', 'reawaken', 'abilities', 'new', 'temporary', 'partner', 'soon', 'obvious', 'something', 'big', 'going', 'down', 'More', 'more', 'demons', 'are', 'trying', 'cross', 'world', 'violating', 'big', 'treaty', 'God', 'Lucifer', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'demons', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'trusted', 'just', ""n't"", 'bode', 'well', 'anybody', 'know', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'coming', 'left', 'right', 'birth', 'Antichrist', 'almost', 'hand.Now', ""'re"", 'probably', 'thinking', 'old', 'Mr.', 'Pitchfork', 'whole', 'Antichrist', 'thing', 'ai', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'so', 'movie', 'throw', 'couple', 'small', 'surprises', 'end', 'certainly', 'new', 'ground', 'showing', 'Lucifer', 'really', 'stupid', 'being', 'really', 'hated', 'characterization', 'angel', 'Gabriel', 'though', 'First', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Gabriel', 'woman', 'more', 'importantly', 'Gabriel', 'across', 'far', 'superior', 'being', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Gabriel', 'who', 'hated', 'conspired', 'humans', 'jealousy', 'Constantine', 'Gabriel', 'far', 'cry', 'similar', 'archangel', 'example', 'Prophecy.The', 'plot', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'much', 'more', 'effectively', ""'re"", 'not', 'kind', 'weird', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'look', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'excuse', 'throw', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'together', ""'m"", 'giving', 'Constantine', 'somewhat', 'tentative', 'four', 'stars', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'good', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'very', 'much']",Constantine

In the flood of recent movie production this title stands out - it doesn't need to catch your attention with streams of blood and gore as it became nearly mandatory and so common these days.John Constantine is a full-time exorcist who takes on evil forces with great experience and talent. He was born with skills to be able to see the dark forces; in the childhood he regrettably attempted a suicide - a mortal sin that prevents him to enter heaven when he dies - so he dedicates his life to fight the dark forces, and also hopes that his achievements may help him to reopen his way to heaven. Anyway, during what seems to be a routine ""service call"" to treat a possessed girl, he encounters one of the unusual and more dangerous demons that are not supposed to be normally entering our world - and John Constantine senses that something bigger is up... his judgment proves right, and John has full hands to deal with the upcoming and quickly worsening situation... The strong part of this movie is the way how supernatural matters are presented here - sort of everyday' bread, casual stuff, and with certain dark humor underlying it - the exorcist takes himself half seriously, he's a chain smoking guy, he does his job but he's not the real ""hero"", he's more of a guy to do the job when needed and as he sees it fit.  The instruments of his trade and tricks he uses in his profession are ""casual"" as well and include a cat & bucket of water or an electric chair as travel devices to hell, his weaponry includes custom cast bullets, flamethrower built from crucifix, holy water sprayed directly or dispersed through the fire sprinkler system... I watched this movie twice few months apart and enjoyed it both times while being able to catch more story details during the second viewing.I'm not familiar with the comic book Hellblazer, the movie is all I'm reviewing here.

A downbeat cynic with a grudge against his creator is given the power to help maintain the balance between good and evil on earth in an effort to ""buy"" his way into heaven.  That says a lot since most of us who do have faith pray with basically selfish motives, then act as though we're doing it to glorify God. Also, I thought the concept of Constantine's smoking captured mankind's affection for spite in a very clever and funny way. Add to that the idea of ""half-breeds"" living among us and ""the wager"", and this movie is, theologically, darn interesting.The problem with Constantine, like so many other big-budget hollywood productions, is that it tries to satisfy all audiences by blending all genres.  Sometimes that works, but not here. Constantine is not scary as a horror movie, and it's humor works more in its recurring gags than its intended comic relief. Granted I never read the comic book, but even if this is a faithful adaptation, a seasoned crew should know what wouldn't work in a transfer to the big screen. Comic relief characters are overused anyway, being that they distract more from the story than they add to it.Keanu Reeves was a good choice for the lead, but the show is nearly stolen by Tilda Swinton's gender-bending Gabriel.

But I was intrigued by the previews, and have enjoyed some other titles of DC Comics' VERTIGO line, so I decided to give this movie a shot.Surprise! I liked it. In fact, it's probably the best supernatural thriller I've seen in a while. (Did anyone else try to sit through ""The Order"" or ""Lost Souls""? Blech!) What I think helped make the film work for me was the dark comedy subtly weaved throughout the film, which kept it from taking itself too seriously. In terms of the special affects and CGI, I thought they worked well; I never felt like they overpowered the film or the actors the way they did in a film like ""Van Helsing"", so I never felt like I was watching a cartoon instead of a live action film.As for the acting, I think it's time someone took a stand for much-criticized Mr. Reeves. True, he's not a technically superior actor, but he does have a definite charisma, and I think a very good sense of both action and comedy. (I've seen Keanu give good, effective performances in a variety of films, including ""Something's Gotta Give"", ""The Gift"", ""Parenthood"", ""Speed"", and, of course, the ""Matrix"" trilogy. So give poor Keanu a break guys! It's not his fault he's so pretty!)

With that said, it fares somewhat better than I'd expected. It isn't a raging success story, but it's not a tragic insult to the rich, lengthy source material either. Keanu Reeves is a horrible choice for the lead, no doubt about that - where the funny book Constantine is a complex, witty, bitter but charismatic subculture hero, Keanu's interpretation is as nuanced as a bag of bricks. I don't know how much I can fault the actor for that - after all, he's been playing dress-up with the same character for two decades now - but regardless of where the blame lies, he lacks the unspoken authenticity that role needs to get off the ground. Fortunately, the blow is softened somewhat by a dynamite intro sequence that may as well have been ripped straight from the pages of the comic and a decent, if indulgent, central storyline. With a full-blown war between heaven and hell at its core, it would've been very easy to get overly adventurous with the film's scope, but it wisely maintains a short focal range and that keeps things mostly grounded. It won't be finding a home on anyone's top ten list, and it's not easy to look past Keanu being Keanu (with Shia freaking LaBeouf crammed in as a throwaway sidekick), but the tone is right and the special effects work is a grand success.

He commited suicied when he was a teen and went straight to hell - because it is a mortal sin. But then he came back and has worked for god, sending all the demons and ""half-breeds"" as he can back to hell. By doing this he hopes to get into heaven because he is doomed to die of lung-cancer.Rachel Weisz can also see certain things, as did her institutionalised twin sister.

All I really knew was it involved Keanu Reeves & the devil. Now I'm a huge Keanu fan, but that doesn't mean I like all of his films (ex. The Replacements, Sweet November). Now I've heard of reviewers (negatively) comparing this to The Matrix sequels, because of the special affects. But I think it has more of the feel of another great Keanu movie The Devil's Advocate. Concerning the special affects, they are needed here. It's not like when they use them in movie when a stunt person could've done it. These are big demonic affects. This film has a dark atmosphere & we get to see the main character, John Constantine's personality. This movie is basically about the power struggle between good & evil. Constantine is an exorcist who is trying to get into heaven, after having committed an inexcusable sin. Rachel Weisz is a detective who doesn't believe her twin sister would've committed suicide & eventually convinces Reeves to help her find out the truth. They also battle various demons leading up to a major power stuggle in the end. You might not know off hand what some of the religious events in the movie involve if you haven't read anything about Christian Mythology. I did know what they were talking about, but even if I didn't I don't think it would have detracted from the movie. My only quibbles are with the casting.

907418,A146D2LYLICNLS,B0009KA7BS,eric_f,"[2, 3]","I'll begin by saying that I know nothing about the Constantine comic book story, for the simple fact that I've never been into comic books. Most of the negative reviews here seem to be by those who say the movie does not follow the comic book story, so I'll take their word for it. But for someone like me, I have to judge this movie on its merits alone. And what about its merits? Well, I didn't think it was a complete disaster, but not among the better movies I've seen lately either.Whether Keanu Reeves did justice or not to the character of Constantine will be open to personal interpretation, again, mainly by those who know the comic book story. For the rest of us, it all depends on how much we like (or dislike) Keanu Reeves. If you didn't like him before, this movie won't change your mind about him, put it that way. In some areas he's as wooden as a 2x4, and yet in other areas he isn't. I've never quite figured out the mystery of Keanu Reeves. In any event, I thought he was adequate as Constantine. No, he won't win an Oscar for his performance, but this movie wasn't made to win any Oscars. Just one of the things to keep in mind as you enter the theater.One of the things this movie has going for it is the special effects. The scenes where Constantine travels to Hell are simply awesome, no doubt about it. The rest of the special effects are pretty much standard stuff. I also liked the way the movie has a nocturnal feel to it, with most shots of the city taking place at night, when the scary stuff usually happens in this world.In terms of other performances, I'll agree with other reviewers that Rachel Weisz does a nice job in her role. She's able to make us feel for her character and displays a depth not very common in that type of female role in other movies, where the main purpose is to just look pretty for the camera. But the real star has gotta be the ever-so-underrated and ever-so-underused Tilda Swinton as Gabriel. She isn't given very much screen time, but when she does come on screen, it's pure magic. Why this talented actress hasn't gotten bigger roles is beyond me (if you want to see a movie that fully allows her to show her talent, watch ""Orlando"" or ""The Beach"").""Constantine"" does have its flaws though. For one, many parts of the script are cliched to death. Case in point, Constantine's geeky sidekick who ends up saving his a** and becomes a minor hero when Constantine runs out of bullets. Looks very familiar, huh? That's because it is, done hundreds of times before. The other problem I have with ""Constantine"" is that it tries too hard at times to replicate classic horror flicks such as ""The Exorcist."" A perfect example is at the beginning of the movie with the girl and the demon. As one is watching this, they are almost expecting the infamous pea soup to fly out of her mouth. I don't have a problem with paying homage to other movies, but this is overdone to the point of trying to copy it. Sorry, there is only ONE ""The Exorcist.""All in all, I would hesitantly recommend ""Constantine."" While not very memorable and quite disposable, it has its good points. Was I presented with an outstanding quality movie? No, I wasn't. But was I entertained for 2 hours? Yes, I was.

The director/screen writer has a knack for horror humor which just blew me away.  This is an instant classing in my mind because it has so many elements of horror lacking in movies today.  I give it five stars because I left the movie with a grin on my face and I was laughing all the way home at the humor in it.  The atmosphere of the movie and everything about it is just awesome.  I guess I've been hungry for this kind of horror for a long time.  Not since the Prophecy series have we seen this sort of struggle in a movie.

907425,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B0009KA7BS,Get What We Give,"[1, 2]","Keanu Reeves will undoubtedly never win an Academy Award for acting. That is actually a shame, because I think he delivers some really great performances. He's not as annoyingly flashy as Tom Cruise, as oddly lovable as Tom Hanks, or as physically expressive as Brad Pitt, but Reeves plays his characters as extensions of himself (which, by the way, as an actor myself, is the only way any human being can actually play a role) and his own internalization of his emotions. Reeves' eyes tell the story, not his face. The way he might hold his head provides you insight that another actor might display on his face.All that said, Reeves' portrayal of John Constantine is as unique as his character of Jack Traven (Speed) was. (While I love the first Matrix, I was sorely disappointed by the director's vision and delivery of the sequels). Reeves delivers a great performance in Constantine.John Constantine has always been tortured by the gift of seeing the evil that lurks just outside of the vision of most all other humans. When it became too much for him as a teenager, he committed suicide. He was brought back 2 minutes later, empowered with the ability to return ""halfbreed"" demons to Hell when they overstepped their boundaries. Unfortunately, he was also damned to hell for having committed suicide. Constantine continues to protect humans from the half breed demons in an effort to save his own soul.With really cool sets and a script that keeps you guessing (with the exception of the ending), Constantine delivers a moody and surreal landscape for this world and that of hell. The demons are unique but not particularly scary. The scary stuff is the Biblical references.This is based on a comic from Vertigo (DC) Comics. It's a dark film and I can only suppose that the comic was equally so.I think the script was very engaging and tight up until the end. The ending of the film seems to take the easy way out. Whereas we see Constantine perform a painful and drawn outexorcism early on, the final exorcism - with ostensibly a far more powerful demon - takes place relatively quickly and easily.I love Tilda Swinton (wonderful as usual) as the angel Gabriel and Peter Stormare as Lucifer (though his performance was not so much evil as it was weirdly silly). Rachel Weitz was really interesting as the female lead. She made me completely forget her forgettable performance in The Mummy.I also particularly loved the ""move ins"" to Weitz's character that Reeves does on several occasions.

Gilbert""","[1, 2]","...what the heck, why can't I at least sort of like this movie?The first time that I saw it (yep, bought it before I saw it) I wasn't so sure.  I think in part because I didn't have the volume turned up very loud, and I missed a lot of what was being said.  Also, I've never read the comic book(s?) that the movie is based off of, which made me even more confused.  This past time that I watched it I turned on the closed caption so that I wouldn't miss anything, and that helped out quite a bit.As other reviewers have noted, the storyline is simple enough: John Constantine is trying to help prevent the Devil's son from being born on earth and terrifying all of it's inhabitents.  The special effects are incredible, and I really enjoyed the many visual aspects of the movie.The acting is, well, not the best.  I get a kick out of Keanu Reeves, but not so much because I think he's a good actor - more just because it's sort of entertaining watching him make sort of a stooge out of himself trying to look all tough (he was perfect in the Matrix - he was supposed to be the confused guy).  Rachel Weisz (Angela/Isabel Dodson) was by far (in my opinion) the best actor in the whole movie, and the only one who came off as believable for the whole movie.  Gavin Rossdale (Balthazar) is flat out laughable.  He tried to be all mysterious and evil, but he comes across more as seeming like he's in a stand-up routine in which he's trying to convince Barbie that he's far cooler than Ken doll.  It's unfortunate, because his character could have been so much more sinister.  Peter Stormare (Satan/Lucifer), on the other hand, did have the subtleness of his evil played out perfectly and he really came across as terrifying; in a charming way.  Tilda Swinton (Gabriel) was a mixture of good and bad acting: she was fine intially, but the very last scene where she's telling Constantine just how 'well he's doing' is just pathetic.I think that I can understand why this movie has had so many poor reviews - many parts of it are awkward and too long, with other parts not being explained well enough for someone unfamiliar with the story.  But I think this movie is alright, in the best sense of the world.Theologically, the movie is strong at parts and weak at others.  Suicide as always damning is not biblical, and the whole half-breed thing is also a stretch - I found the way that Gabriel, one of the Archangels in the bible, was portrayed as basically evil was unfortunate.  However, Angela is right - you can't buy your way into heaven!  Let it be clear though that I'm not trying to say these are really negative marks against the movie - this movie isn't about theology, it's about entertainment...enjoy!",4,"Well, I think I missed something, but...",1130976000,"11 3, 2005",2005,2708,"['what', 'heck', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'least', 'sort', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'yep', 'bought', 'saw', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'sure', 'think', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'volume', 'turned', 'up', 'very', 'loud', 'missed', 'lot', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'Also', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'comic', 'book', 's', 'movie', 'based', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'confused', 'past', 'time', 'watched', 'turned', 'closed', 'caption', 'would', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything', 'helped', 'out', 'quite', 'bit.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'storyline', 'simple', 'enough', 'John', 'Constantine', 'trying', 'help', 'prevent', 'Devil', 'son', 'being', 'born', 'earth', 'terrifying', 'inhabitents', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'incredible', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'visual', 'aspects', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'well', 'not', 'best', 'get', 'kick', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'good', 'actor', 'more', 'just', 'sort', 'entertaining', 'watching', 'make', 'sort', 'stooge', 'trying', 'look', 'tough', 'was', 'perfect', 'Matrix', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'confused', 'guy', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Angela/Isabel', 'Dodson', 'was', 'far', 'opinion', 'best', 'actor', 'whole', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'came', 'off', 'believable', 'whole', 'movie', 'Gavin', 'Rossdale', 'Balthazar', 'flat', 'laughable', 'tried', 'be', 'mysterious', 'evil', 'across', 'more', 'seeming', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'trying', 'convince', 'Barbie', 'far', 'cooler', 'Ken', 'doll', 'unfortunate', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'sinister', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'Satan/Lucifer', 'other', 'hand', 'did', 'have', 'subtleness', 'evil', 'played', 'out', 'perfectly', 'really', 'came', 'terrifying', 'charming', 'way', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Gabriel', 'was', 'mixture', 'good', 'bad', 'acting', 'was', 'fine', 'intially', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'where', 'telling', 'Constantine', 'just', 'how', ""'well"", 'doing', 'just', 'pathetic.I', 'think', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'poor', 'reviews', 'many', 'parts', 'are', 'awkward', 'too', 'long', 'other', 'parts', 'not', 'being', 'explained', 'well', 'enough', 'someone', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'think', 'movie', 'alright', 'best', 'sense', 'world.Theologically', 'movie', 'strong', 'parts', 'weak', 'others', 'Suicide', 'always', 'damning', 'not', 'biblical', 'whole', 'half-breed', 'thing', 'also', 'stretch', 'found', 'way', 'Gabriel', 'one', 'Archangels', 'bible', 'was', 'portrayed', 'basically', 'evil', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'However', 'Angela', 'right', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'way', 'heaven', 'Let', 'be', 'clear', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'say', 'are', 'really', 'negative', 'marks', 'movie', 'movie', ""n't"", 'about', 'theology', 'entertainment', 'enjoy']",Constantine
907427,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B0009KA7BS,Ghoulie Guru,"[4, 9]","How do you take an amazingly simple concept like HELLBLAZER and turn it into a ridiculously mundane and uninspired movie? Just cast Keanu Reeves. Evidently, Warner Brothers thought that the success of the MATRIX was due to Keanu's acting. They failed to realize that most of the credit should be going to the Wachowski brothers for having the keen insight to cast Keanu as an emotionally vacant Kung Fu master. Keanu is really good at looking emotionally vacant. But when it comes to a character like John Constantine, it would have been nice to cast someone who can actually act.For anyone that doesn't know it, this movie is based on a long-running comic book series by DC that revolves around John Constantine. Constantine is basically a modern-day incarnation of an old Raymond Chandler gumshoe that chases down demons instead of criminals. It's a great concept, which is why the comic book has a huge cult following. In the comic, John Constantine is a tortured, craggy, rugged man with white/blonde hair. The way that he's drawn usually makes me think of Rutger Hauer and Roy Batty.This thing was doomed the moment they cast Keanu Reeves. It's not just the fact that Keanu's hair is black. I'm not that much of a purist. I didn't have a hissy fit when they cast Tom Cruise as Lestat. A little peroxide will do wonders for the hair color, but what Tom had going for him was the fact that he can act. Keanu, unfortunately, cannot. He's like the male version of Tara Reid. Keanu should really just resign himself to being a bimbo. He should just stand around and look pretty, that's about all he's good for. His acting is always flat and boring. The only movie where I remember actually liking his performance was Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. And that was probably because he was just playing himself... a stoner. And it was also probably because I was also like 6 years old when I saw it.The movie itself has some good moments, and the storyline is vaguely interesting, but I really just couldn't buy Keanu as a tough guy. It's impossible for me to say whether this movie could have been better if they'd cast someone else as Constantine, because Keanu is on screen for most of the movie. His stoner voice is so distinct, it's really difficult to ignore. The storyline had potential, and the guy that played Papa Midnight was perfect, but every time that Keanu was on screen the movie just lost all of its momentum. So, whoever decided to cast Keanu as Constantine should be fired. He or she is single-handedly responsible for destroying what could have been a huge franchise for Warner Brothers.",2,Keanustantine's Excellent Adventure,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,2607,"['How', 'do', 'take', 'amazingly', 'simple', 'concept', 'HELLBLAZER', 'turn', 'ridiculously', 'mundane', 'uninspired', 'movie', 'Just', 'cast', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Evidently', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'thought', 'success', 'MATRIX', 'was', 'due', 'Keanu', 'acting', 'failed', 'realize', 'most', 'credit', 'should', 'be', 'going', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'having', 'keen', 'insight', 'cast', 'Keanu', 'emotionally', 'vacant', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'master', 'Keanu', 'really', 'good', 'looking', 'emotionally', 'vacant', 'when', 'character', 'John', 'Constantine', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'cast', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'act.For', 'anyone', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'based', 'long-running', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'DC', 'John', 'Constantine', 'Constantine', 'basically', 'modern-day', 'incarnation', 'old', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'gumshoe', 'down', 'demons', 'instead', 'criminals', 'great', 'concept', 'why', 'comic', 'book', 'huge', 'cult', 'following', 'comic', 'John', 'Constantine', 'tortured', 'craggy', 'rugged', 'man', 'white/blonde', 'hair', 'way', 'drawn', 'usually', 'think', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Roy', 'Batty.This', 'thing', 'was', 'doomed', 'moment', 'cast', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'not', 'just', 'fact', 'Keanu', 'hair', 'black', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'purist', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'hissy', 'fit', 'when', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Lestat', 'little', 'peroxide', 'will', 'do', 'wonders', 'hair', 'color', 'what', 'Tom', 'had', 'going', 'was', 'fact', 'can', 'act', 'Keanu', 'unfortunately', 'can', 'not', 'male', 'version', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'Keanu', 'should', 'really', 'just', 'resign', 'being', 'bimbo', 'should', 'just', 'stand', 'around', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'always', 'flat', 'boring', 'only', 'movie', 'where', 'remember', 'actually', 'liking', 'performance', 'was', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'Excellent', 'Adventure', 'was', 'probably', 'was', 'just', 'playing', 'stoner', 'was', 'also', 'probably', 'was', 'also', '6', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'saw', 'it.The', 'movie', 'good', 'moments', 'storyline', 'vaguely', 'interesting', 'really', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Keanu', 'tough', 'guy', 'impossible', 'say', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', ""'d"", 'cast', 'someone', 'else', 'Constantine', 'Keanu', 'screen', 'most', 'movie', 'stoner', 'voice', 'so', 'distinct', 'really', 'difficult', 'ignore', 'storyline', 'had', 'potential', 'guy', 'played', 'Papa', 'Midnight', 'was', 'perfect', 'time', 'Keanu', 'was', 'screen', 'movie', 'just', 'lost', 'momentum', 'So', 'whoever', 'decided', 'cast', 'Keanu', 'Constantine', 'should', 'be', 'fired', 'single-handedly', 'responsible', 'destroying', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'franchise', 'Warner', 'Brothers']",Constantine

He knows that Hell is his fate because he does not fit the critera for Heaven (since he sees good and evil, and has seen Hell he does not have Faith, one can't have faith if one knows the truth) so he is destined for the prison where he has send half of the inmates.

Well, you know what this means, I'm going to have to get this one once it's out on DVD. But that's not all, it's actually a good movie. It was confusing at times but I think that this movie is deeper than most say. The movie is about John Constantine, a man that can see dead people that walk on earth. He thus has to take them back to hell where they belong. The beautiful Rachel Weisz co stars also as someone who believes that the ""suicide"" of her sister isn't a suicide. The way that Constantine travels to Hell is really neat and original and the fight scenes are really neat, as he has some really cool weapons. The bible is also referenced in the movie but this isn't the same bible. This one has a ""deleted"" section where it speaks about the son of the devil.

I'm the same guy though that dissliked Scarface and Taxi Driver, so you kmow..I also found something very neat about this movie.

And the sacrifice is supposed to save the world. Not by redeeming the sins of human beings. But by preventing the birth of Lucifer's son and the total take-over of the world by him. The strangest element is that everything is purely haphazard. There is no plan, no real perspective known and controlled by anyone, especially not God, and least of all Lucifer. It is pure opportunism on their sides and human beings are always taken in-between these two famously inconsequent and irresponsible characters and they have to accept, follow and suffer what the other two in their big conflict don't even know they produce.

907485,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B0009KA7BS,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[50, 58]","I missed ""Constantine"" in theaters and thus looked forward to discovering for the first time via home viewing a quality motion picture adaptation of a popular comic book character.  And, in the end, I did enjoy the film.  Just be warned that it isn't like the ""Spider-Man"" movies.  Unlike those earlier films, ""Constantine"" is more interesting and intellectually stimulating than exciting.In particular, I enjoyed the film's somewhat subversive vision that the goals and objectives emanating from Heaven and Hell are sometimes laced with the same base political motivations that are often the springboards for the official positions held by powerful organizations here on Earth.  I liked how the bad guys could be charming and somewhat sympathetic despite their Hellish origins, and how the holy characters (I'm mostly thinking of Tilda Swinton's Angel Gabriel character here) can come up with questionable and truly bizarre plans to rid the Earth of evil, even if it means something close to apocalypse has to result in the meantime.The film skillfully mixes several genres and flavors (horror movie, detective thriller, and romance story among them), which successfully results in an entertaining whole.  It's just not a wildly entertaining whole, and you'll probably have more fun disecting the movie with a friend afterward over a beer than you did when you were watching it.I bought the two-disc special edition, and the extras on the second disc are very well done.  In fact, if you don't know much about the Constantine character beforehand it's perfectly safe to watch the first couple of featurettes on the second disc before you watch the movie; they discuss the comic book origins of the character and the goals the film makers had in adapting the character to the screen.  These featurettes don't give away any major plot points and may make it easier to appreciate the film a little more when you watch it.  As a John Constantine novice I wished that I had watched those extra features first; I would have gotten more out of my first viewing of the movie.Still, I enjoyed ""Constantine"".  After all, one has to have a soft spot for a movie that suggests that even death isn't an escape from the mundane bureaucracies of daily life, that one just trades dull rules and regulations administered by earthbound bureaucrats with mundane rules and regulations administered by angels and demons.

I agree that you are going to either like or hate this type of movie full of CGI the old worn out good versus evil plot and an actor in Reeves who is hated as much as he is admired. I for one am in the first group and think he does very interesting movies that suit his acting style and the characters he likes to play. Constatine is loosely based on a poupular comic book about a man with a special gift who is trying to redeem himself in order to get into heaven. Along the way he meets a detective who badly wants to avenge her twin sisters death and they work together batteling evil with allot of interesting characters on the side. I think critics of this movie took it too seriously. Purists think it ripped the comic book off when in fact it makes me interested in tracking it down. Second the Heaven versus Hell plot while done a million times is done well here with a few viewpoints I can actually find intriguing. The special effects are excellent and the pacing of the movie was good as it wasn't too short like some of Fox's horrendous adaptations of comics like Daredevil(which got saved by a GREAT director's cut) and Elektra.

Mainly because I had never read the comic book 'Hellblazer', that inspired the film.  Then I saw the preview and it looked like a very entertaining sci-fi/religious thrill ride in the vein of 'The Prophecy' series, ""End of Days"", and ""Hellboy"", plus Keanu looked pretty cool in one of his first post-'Matrix' action films.""Constantine"" is based on the popular Vertigo/DC Comic 'Hellblazer', which follows the demon hunting exploits of its hero John Constantine (Keanu Reeves).  Constantine is a chain smoking, wise-cracking, selfish demon hunter, whose primary goal in life is to send as many of Hell's minions back to where they belong and hopefully work his way into Heaven.  During his quest he is aided by Chaz (Shia Lebouf), Papa Midnight (Djimon Hounsou), and a seemingly duplictious angel named Gabriel (Tilda Swinton).  When a cop (Rachel Weisz) discovers her twin sister has seemingly committed suicide, she enlists the aide of Constantine in discovering what exactly happened to her God-fearing sister to cause her to end her life.  This mystery only deepens as Constantine discovers that demons are attempting to crossover into Earth's realm, and this cop, when coupled with the mythic Spear of Destiny, is the key.With terrific special effects, most notably the imaginative interpretation of Hell as being an alternate reality, so that it appears to be a constantly buring Los Angeles.  Pitch-perfect performances by the cast, that bring depth and reality to their comic book counterparts, and fast-paced editing and directing from first time movie director Francis Lawrence, ""Constantine"" is sci-fi/religious thriller that is guaranteed to keep you entertained.Though, not entirely faithful to the comic book according to fan boys and the movies own making of featurette admits this, the film is an enjoyable comic book adaptation.  The theology for the movie is steeped primarily in Catholicism, even then it's not an accurate depiction of the faith, definitely not a movie to base your religious beliefs on, but then again it never aspired for that purpose.  As I said earlier, it appeared this one would be another one of the great sci-fi/religious thrillers, and I was right.

For some reason, Amazon just lumps them in with the regular edition.I enjoyed this movie and I'm glad I shelled out for the deluxe edition, if only because of the Hellblazer comic that's included with the package.  I was hoping the extras would add more in the way of explanations for some of what happens in the film, but they don't.  This is why the entire package loses one star.  Particularly aggravating is the commentary from Akiva Goldsman and the director.  Goldsman's voice is like listening to nails on a chalkboard.  I eventually had to turn off the commentary because I couldn't take the noise anymore.

The stories he gets and his supporting cast is so good that they make him look even better and he gets a high price tag. Constantine needed an actor to play the character as a mean, intimidating, and vicious loner and who better to play that than a man who had that exact role in his previous films.So I don't see Reeves as a problem but why this film gets such low ratings could either be that it's not true to the comic like other reviewers suspected or it could be because it's not true to the history of the real Constantine. Whatever it may be with those who have the knowledge of the comic or factual history this is a good movie either way.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[10, 14]","While I wouldn't use ""Constantine"" as a source for any studies on Catholicism(or Christianity as a whole), I will admit that it is a decent flick to watch when there's a little time to kill.  I'm not familiar with the comics that this film is supposed to be based on, so I'll look at it as a stand-alone entity.The story plods along at a snails pace, but the special effects are pretty good, especially the visions of Hell.  The opening exorcism is one of the best parts of the film.  Although Keanu Reeves catches a lot of grief over his performance in this flick, I think that his acting skills were perfect for this particular story.  Rachel Weisz is also very good in this film.  She tackles a briefly dual role as psychic sisters.  Her character's supposedly Catholic beliefs come into question when she mentions that she doesn't believe in Satan.  That's almost like saying you're a Catholic and you're pro-abortion.  That's two things that just don't go together.The Catholicism in this story is treated very lightly.  It's almost as if they just used Christianity as a cool looking backdrop for Constantine to eradicate things in.  The Crucifix-looking gun was rather silly looking, but Constantine did have some other nice weapons in his arsenal.Once again, a well-known angel plays the fall guy and much like in films like ""The Prophecy,"" everything boils down to the baddie-supreme:  Satan(a.k.a. Lucifer, Beelzebub, the Devil, Angel of Light, etc.).While I won't say that everyone will enjoy this film, I'm sure fans of modest action flicks will enjoy this.  Some Catholics will probably be turned off by the sacrilege and the ability of Satan to do certain things in the film.

907506,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0009KA7BS,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 3]","The moral values of Christianity have been fostered throughout the Western world for centuries where the good go to heaven and the bad enters hell.  Time on earth is merely a diverging road through which people are influenced in one of two directions - heaven or hell.  The film Constantine spices up this notion with an additional set of thoughts that has been put into action through an agreement between God and Satan.  Earth is a place where God and Satan can act upon the humans by the means of influence, which means they can guide people to their respective direction.  The agreement also states that it is forbidden to act directly with or against the humans.The story unleashes itself on the audience through a teen girl that has been possessed by a demon.  Monstrously, as seen in other horror films such as Exorcist (1973), the girl behaves until John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) arrives to the scene with a cigarette tightly held with the lips.  Constantine places the cigarette on a dresser, as he goes to work on the girl by identifying the demon inside her.  A fight for existence between the planes is commenced between Constantine and the demon, but Constantine knows what he does, as this is something he has done before.  This opening scene is a promise of what is to come, but it does not give away the horrors that Constantine will face later.Misery and distress is eating up Constantine from within, as he discovers that his days are numbered on the earth.  The habit, which began when he was 15, has slowly clogged up his lungs as he is little by little suffocating from the big black lumps inside his lungs that are caused by his smoking.  This makes him seek out Gabriel in order to request a passage to heaven for all the good deeds he has done on earth.  However, Gabriel informs Constantine that he must commit an act of pure goodness without personal gain in order to accomplish such a feat, and as he is already pledged to go to hell it is impossible.  Stuck on earth knowing that he will be torn into pieces in hell for an eternity is too much even for a hardened hero such as Constantine who lights up another cigarette.Through Constantine's calling, the audience gets to meet Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), who has lost her sister in what the police identify as a suicide, but Angela thinks differently.  Angela's suspicions lead her to seek Constantine's help, as something peculiar seems to be in the works.  However, she has no idea how outlandish the force is that she is about to confront.  Initially, Constantine rejects to help her, but when he notices something sinister luring in the shadows he changes his mind.  Together they are about make a stand against the deadliest assault that earth has ever faced, and they have no choice other than to welcome the coming of the dark forces.Constantine is based on a comic book character, John Constantine, that first appeared in 1985 in Saga Of The Swamp Thing #37, however, eventually he earned himself his own comic book called Hellblazer.  The world of John Constantine is dark and full of despair, which is engulfed in the stale cigarette smell that surrounds him.  Constantine, in essence, is a selfish man that spreads gloom around him, as he is one of very few people that can see the true nature of the human society.  This is a gift he uses to bargain for his life, as he is aware of his future destiny, a destiny he wants to avoid at all costs.The director Francis Lawrence does a good job capturing this dark world of John Constantine.  Lawrence even pokes fun of the cigarette corporations in this film, as he states the obvious that smoking is lethal, which shines through in the final scene.  The camera work is outstanding, as it enhances the dark moments of the story, but it also helps to induce emotions with corresponding scenes.  There is, however, a few awkward moments such as when Keanu Reeves occasionally inhales cigarette smoke as if he was beginner to the habit that he supposedly began at the age of fifteen.  The dark and unexpected world of Constantine opens very well, but this anxiety-ridden tale slowly loses its grip on the audience.

I thought the movie had some good performances, an interestingly executed storyline, and some great fx.The movie's first 20 or 30 minutes started out really great and promising, but to me really seemed like it lost its steam about halfway through. There was about a half hour in the middle that really bored the heck out me, and the end picked up somewhat, but didn't do as much for me as the first part of the film did. Leaving the theater I felt satisfied, but kind of unsatisifed at the same time.

But I was surprised to discover this movie was enjoyable.Best of all was Rachel Weisz.  She is an underused actress working in films today.  Which is a shame because she is fun to watch and very generous with her costars. Her role as a detective discovering a hidden talent and investigating her sister's murder was very believable.Reeves is a very reticent and private actor.  Not many of his female costars break thru with him.  Moss almost did in the Matrix films.  But in this film, Keanu perks up and responds to Weisz whenever she enters the frame.  They have fantastic chemistry and it was great watching the emerging relationship between their characters.Rachel Weisz brings out the best in Keanu Reeves and I hope that they work together again.  If it has to be a Constantine sequel so be it.  But a comedy would fit them both very well.  Reeves has shown himself to be a deft comedian in the past.  But he has been avoiding the genre. And Weisz lit up the whole Mummy franchise.The rest of the cast was fantastic also.  Shia LaBeouf is turning into a very nice actor,Dijmon Hounsou is a blast as a witch doctor, Tilda Swinton is eerie as an angel gone mad and Peter Stormare just rocks as the Prince of Darkness.

Thriller wise the movie is not bad, good usage of camera angles, music and themes but nothing we have not already seen.Believe it or not, but it was quite humorous in some spots.

When the devil appeared and took action, I had to ask my friend next to me why in hell he was doing that... turns out I missed it amongst the dialogue that was lost amongst other things.  Other parts, I had no clue what was going on, the screenwriters could've done a much better job at making some things more obvious than others.Keanu Reeves cannot act worth his life, although I saw double the amount of Keanu's facial expressions in Constantine than I saw in The Matrix... namely two.

Alot of time was clearly put into the plot.Excellent performances were put-forth for Constantine. I really enjoyed Peter Stormare's performance in his role of Satan and Tilda Swinton's in her role of the archangel Gabriel. Although, I did find it kind of odd that a woman was cast as Gabriel... But, she handled the role so well that in the end, casting a female rather than a male in that role did seem more fitting. It really worked. But, my favorite portrayal of Gabriel is still Christopher Walken's in the Prophecy series (I recommend that series for supernatural thrillers, too!).Reeves and Weisz both put-forth great performances. I don't know why people are trying to compare Reeves's performance in this movie to that of his much earlier role in The Devil's Advocate. The way he's acting in this movie might be along the same track as Advocate's, but if so, why care? The way he portrays John Constantine is what the movie called for: a dark mind. And Contantine and Advocate are two completely different films with two completely different scenarios. The only similarity: they both deal with heaven and hell. Period. Deal with it. And don't even think of bringing up The Matrix. It's a masterpiece of filmmaking on its own wavelength. Similar concept: both Neo and Constantine are trying to save humanity. You get that alot in movies today.The special-effects were mind-blowing. Whatever team of graphic designers worked on these demons really knew what they were doing. Nothing cheesy.There is nothing wrong with Constantine. It's great. And I recommend listening to the commentary while watching it. Just give Constantine a try. Nothing bad here.

907518,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009KA7BS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","Constantine was an unusual character for a comic book, which explains why the DC/Vertigo comic book ""Hellblazer"" was rather unusual, so it is not surprising that this 2005 film is a bit different as well.  However, ""Hellblazer"" fans may well find the changes in the character to outweigh the fact John Constantine has been brought to the big screen and be disappointed.  But then they already know that from having seen director Francis Lawrence's movie in the theater.  What are left are those who never read ""Swamp Thing"" or ""Hellblazer"" and are drawn by Kenau Reeves being in the film to check out the DVD.Basically, what those viewers need to know about the hero is as follows.  John Constantine became involved with the occult when he was a youngster, and has always had a problem in that he was never really as good as he thought that he was.  Being cocky and brash works well when you are making deals with the minions of Hell, but can be problematic when you are trying to exorcize demons from little girls.  But Constantine can do magic, although he usually exaggerates what he is actually capable of doing and the legends about him are more impressive than his actual accomplishments.  He also happens to be dying of lung cancer, so whatever he is going to do in this world he has to ge done relatively soon.The tagline for ""Constantine"" encapsulates the characters situation as: ""Hell wants him.  Heaven won't take him.  Earth needs him.""  We eventually get a glimpse of Hell, which is, visually at least, an ongoing nuclear firestorm that constitutes a memorable modern version of Dante's Inferno, but for most of this film Hell is in the shadows.  Constantine (Reeves) has been busy sending half-demons back to Hell when he is not busy smoking himself to death, but now full demons are showing up on earth.  This is a violation of the agreement between God and Lucifer, so something big and bad is brewing.  The focal point for Constantine's investigation is the sudden suicide ofa mental patient, whose twince sister, Angela (Rachel Weisz), is a police detective (andt therefore a professional realist who will have trouble believing what Constantine has to say).""Constantine"" is more of a horror film than a comic book film, even with the set-up of the title character as something of a superhero.  Cinematically it is clearly going for more of a sense of film noir than we normally get in either genre, which is an interesting and effective visual style (previously Lawrence had done only music videos).  Unfortunately, the characters and plot are not up to the images (this is another movie where the best special effects pretty much show up in the trailer).  The problem may well be not just that viewers have to be brought up to speed on the character of Constantine in a way that is unnecessary with the first rank comic book heroes such as Batman and Spider-Man, but that you have to have more of an appreciation for Catholic theology than you get from having read ""The Da Vinci Code.""  The again, the Bible tends to see that great battle in terms of black and white, while the world of Constantine is pretty much gray (with blood red splatters).  After all, the angelic Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) does not seem particularly nice for a heavenly being (which gets us back to your understanding of Catholic theology) and not that different from Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale).Then again the problem could be as simple as the casting of Reeves as the reluctant hero dealing with his curse.  Reeves has a definite look in this film, but it is not the look of John Constantine.  More importantly, the character is too different from the one in the comic book.  Granted, you have to have read ""Hellblazer"" to know that, but I am here to argue that the caustic S.O.B. of the comic book would work better in this storyline than what Reeves provides, especially when Satan himself (Peter Stormare) shows up for a chat.  Whether he intended to or not, the way Reeves plays Constantine is just too much like Neo in ""The Matrix,"" which is wrong on several key levels.  Still, given the visual strengths of the production and the way Keeves wants to go with the character maybe the greatest fault with this movie lies with the basic story that Kevin Brodbin came up with (Brodbin and Frank Cappello did the screenplay) from the comic books written by Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis.  There should have been a better way of making this all work.",3,Now that they have made a movie about Constantine can we have our Hellblazer back?,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,4443,"['Constantine', 'was', 'unusual', 'character', 'comic', 'book', 'why', 'DC/Vertigo', 'comic', 'book', 'Hellblazer', 'was', 'rather', 'unusual', 'not', 'surprising', '2005', 'film', 'bit', 'different', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'Hellblazer', 'fans', 'may', 'well', 'find', 'changes', 'character', 'outweigh', 'fact', 'John', 'Constantine', 'been', 'brought', 'big', 'screen', 'be', 'disappointed', 'then', 'already', 'know', 'having', 'seen', 'director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'movie', 'theater', 'What', 'are', 'left', 'are', 'who', 'never', 'read', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'Hellblazer', 'are', 'drawn', 'Kenau', 'Reeves', 'being', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'DVD.Basically', 'what', 'viewers', 'need', 'know', 'hero', 'John', 'Constantine', 'became', 'involved', 'occult', 'when', 'was', 'youngster', 'always', 'had', 'problem', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'as', 'good', 'thought', 'was', 'Being', 'cocky', 'brash', 'works', 'well', 'when', 'are', 'making', 'deals', 'minions', 'Hell', 'can', 'be', 'problematic', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'exorcize', 'demons', 'little', 'girls', 'Constantine', 'can', 'do', 'magic', 'usually', 'what', 'actually', 'capable', 'doing', 'legends', 'are', 'more', 'impressive', 'actual', 'accomplishments', 'also', 'be', 'dying', 'lung', 'cancer', 'so', 'going', 'do', 'world', 'ge', 'done', 'relatively', 'soon.The', 'tagline', 'Constantine', 'characters', 'situation', 'Hell', 'Heaven', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'Earth', 'eventually', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Hell', 'visually', 'least', 'ongoing', 'nuclear', 'firestorm', 'memorable', 'modern', 'version', 'Dante', 'Inferno', 'most', 'film', 'Hell', 'shadows', 'Constantine', 'Reeves', 'been', 'busy', 'sending', 'half-demons', 'back', 'Hell', 'when', 'not', 'busy', 'smoking', 'death', 'now', 'full', 'demons', 'are', 'showing', 'up', 'earth', 'violation', 'agreement', 'God', 'Lucifer', 'so', 'something', 'big', 'bad', 'brewing', 'focal', 'point', 'Constantine', 'investigation', 'sudden', 'suicide', 'mental', 'patient', 'twince', 'sister', 'Angela', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'police', 'detective', 'andt', 'therefore', 'professional', 'realist', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'trouble', 'believing', 'what', 'Constantine', 'say', 'Constantine', 'more', 'horror', 'film', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'even', 'set-up', 'title', 'character', 'something', 'superhero', 'Cinematically', 'clearly', 'going', 'more', 'sense', 'film', 'noir', 'normally', 'get', 'genre', 'interesting', 'effective', 'visual', 'style', 'previously', 'Lawrence', 'had', 'done', 'only', 'music', 'videos', 'Unfortunately', 'characters', 'plot', 'are', 'not', 'images', 'movie', 'where', 'best', 'special', 'effects', 'pretty', 'much', 'show', 'up', 'trailer', 'problem', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'not', 'just', 'viewers', 'have', 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'speed', 'character', 'Constantine', 'way', 'unnecessary', 'first', 'rank', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'such', 'Batman', 'Spider-Man', 'have', 'have', 'more', 'appreciation', 'Catholic', 'theology', 'get', 'having', 'read', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'again', 'Bible', 'tends', 'see', 'great', 'battle', 'terms', 'black', 'white', 'world', 'Constantine', 'pretty', 'much', 'gray', 'blood', 'red', 'splatters', 'angelic', 'Gabriel', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'not', 'seem', 'particularly', 'nice', 'heavenly', 'being', 'back', 'understanding', 'Catholic', 'theology', 'not', 'different', 'Balthazar', 'Gavin', 'Rossdale', '.Then', 'again', 'problem', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'simple', 'casting', 'Reeves', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'dealing', 'curse', 'definite', 'look', 'film', 'not', 'look', 'John', 'Constantine', 'More', 'importantly', 'character', 'too', 'different', 'one', 'comic', 'book', 'Granted', 'have', 'have', 'read', 'Hellblazer', 'know', 'am', 'here', 'argue', 'caustic', 'S.O.B', 'comic', 'book', 'would', 'work', 'better', 'storyline', 'what', 'Reeves', 'especially', 'when', 'Satan', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'up', 'chat', 'intended', 'not', 'way', 'Reeves', 'Constantine', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'Neo', 'Matrix', 'wrong', 'several', 'key', 'levels', 'Still', 'given', 'visual', 'strengths', 'production', 'way', 'go', 'character', 'maybe', 'greatest', 'fault', 'movie', 'basic', 'story', 'Kevin', 'Brodbin', 'came', 'up', 'Brodbin', 'Frank', 'Cappello', 'did', 'screenplay', 'comic', 'books', 'written', 'Jamie', 'Delano', 'Garth', 'Ennis', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'way', 'making', 'work']",Constantine

They fizzle out in the third act, fumble the finale and are never quite sure how to wrap things up.Not ""Constantine.""The duel-with-the-devil drama starring Keanu Reeves adopts the opposite formula. Most of the interesting moments are stockpiled for the last 20 minutes. Minor characters appear to deliver a punch, and the film finally takes off.This is good.And bad. It means you have to slog through the often-sluggish first two-thirds to reach the payoff. Director Francis Lawrence, known for music videos, took on quite a challenge for his feature film debut. It's based on the ""Hellblazer"" series of graphic novels about John Constantine, a kind of exorcist detective demon-fighter.There are powerful jolt-moments of creepy-looking demon dudes, followed by calm moments, followed by more jolts. This is what you might call the film's rhythm. But when these moments are so telegraphed, the jolts lose their luster.The premise, however, is a real corker.The chain-smoking Constantine has the ability to see half-breeds (agents of good or evil who are here to mess with mankind), and he's adept at sending the bad ones to hell. The problem is: His lungs are shot, and he doesn't have long to live. He'd rather not take the down escalator and be reunited with the scum he sent to the underworld. So he's working on making it to heaven.But first he needs to help Angela (Rachel Weisz), a police detective trying to solve her twin sister's mysterious death, and steer clear of Satan's evil emissary, Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale). Along the way, he encounters the spear of destiny, secret Bible passages and a vintage electric chair.It helps that Constantine can drop in on hell, a fury-filled fiery wasteland. (Note to Hollywood: Shouldn't hell look a lot like an office, with cubicles, ringing phones, and co-workers clamoring to line up for somebody's birthday cake? Now that's scary!)He tries to explain to Angela that life is really just a grand wager between God and Satan. She doesn't buy it, preferring to trust in God's plan. ""God's a kid with an ant farm,"" spews Constantine. ""He's not planning anything.""If you've seen the trailer or commercials, you know Warner Bros. is trying to promote ""Constantine"" as a kind of effects-laden ""Matrix 4."" Considering how much people loathed the third ""Matrix,"" that's not the most brilliant marketing strategy.Reeves has that whole fearless-stoicism thing nailed. But the two most memorable cast members are Tilda Swinton and Peter Stormare.Swinton plays a gender-bending Gabriel, God's angel-agent on Earth. Stormare delivers a terrific Lucifer - powerful, threatening and campy-funny.Gabriel and Lucifer are the strength of a climax that includes basically everything: Good vs. evil, God vs. the devil, heaven vs. hell, fate vs. self-determination, sacrifice vs. selfishness, fear vs. love, and, in a nod to the current geopolitical landscape, the question of just who has the right to claim ownership of the Bible and kill ""in the name of God.""My addled brain couldn't process all that.

Constantine seems to have managed to outrage both the Hellblazer comic book crowd and the and the 'this is blasphemous' club.  After all, Constantine is intended as light entertainment, not scripture or imitation.  So let's just take a look at the film in and of itself for a moment. After all, if a film arouses this much antipathy there must be something to it.In John Constantine's (Keanu Reeves) world evil and good are locked in the age old struggle, but there are rules that the two sides play by.  The big rule is that true demons and angels cannot cross over to this plane, although there are plenty of what Constantine refers to as 'half-breeds' to make up the difference.  Constantine is something of an enforcer.  If demons get to out of line, his job is to whomp on them and send them back to hell.  How did he get the job?  It seems that when psychics commit suicide they run the risk of being both damned and restored to a job with no opportunities for advancement.  To make matters worse, John is dying for the second time - from lung cancer.Something is wronger than usual - trash scavengers have uncovered the spear of Longinus, there is unrest among the minions, and a woman commits suicide who never should have.  The woman's sister, Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) is a detective determined to understand how the tragedy could happen.  Before long Dodson and Constantine are working together and they find themselves faced with not just a few souls out of place, but a rebellion in hell that threatens to drop all humanity into the end of days.Reeves creates a Constantine who is more taciturn than the Hellblazer character, but whose grit and brusqueness still make him an interesting figure.  Weisz has more script and she fulfills her part as a foil for Constanine beautifully, This is a film which is decidedly un-sexy, regardless of the attractiveness of the leads.  The bit characters - half-angel Gabriel (played by Tilda Swinton who captures the angel's ambiguous sexuality perfectly), half-demon Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale), Midnote (Djimon Hounsou), and Beeman (Max Baker) - all have a crisp, comic book reality.  And Peter Stormare does an outstanding job as Satan twisted in a whole new fashion.Director Francis Lawrence does a notable job of capturing the feel of comic book illustration and framing within the parameters of film.  The film is carefully balanced between comic book sarcasm, humor, and the horrible seriousness of the underlying theme.  Putting everyone's 'issues' aside (and everyone seems to have one issue or another about Constantine) this is lightweight but well constructed piece of filmic fiction.",4,"""It's called pain!

907532,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0009KA7BS,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Fortunately a few years back my son discovered comic books. At least the card sets that were coming out about that time. In so doing, I helped him to find out what was behind all of those cards and found myself immersed once again in the brightly colored world of comics. Except that I soon discovered that comics were no longer a children's art form but a whole other world of graphic storytelling and imagery that was unlike anything out there with the exception of film. Tales of heaven and hell battling it out for the souls of humans, secret government agencies that allowed people to extract revenge on those who had done them wrong and heroes that actually killed people because they felt it was in the interest of society were all present. And so was John Constantine.The comic series HELLBLAZER was the story of John Constantine. And unfortunately I never found myself drawn to it. As written by Garth Ennis, it took on a legendary status among fans and helped to increase the popularity of DC's Vertigo brand, a home for more adult oriented comics like this and SANDMAN. When I heard it was going to be made into a film I was interested. And after watching this film, I may have to take the chance of picking up some of the trade paperback copies of the series.The film opens with John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) being called to a tenement apartment where a young Hispanic girl has been possessed. With the knowledge he possesses, Constantine is able to bring the demon out of the young girl and send it back to Hell. But something was different here. It seemed that the demon was about to enter our realm and leave its own.We are next introduced to a woman who dreams of another leaping to her death from the top of a building. It turns out it wasn't a dream at all and police detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) saw the death of her twin sister. Called to the scene, she seeks solace from a priest later hoping that he will allow her sister to be buried in consecrated ground. At that time, her path crosses with Contantine.Constantine is at the same church talking about the gamble between God and the devil which allowed them to put man's own free will at stake. Either side might try and influence the actions of man, but neither was allowed to be on this plane. Someone is trying to break that deal and Constantine wants to find out whom.The one fault of the film is in assuming we know all there is to know about Constantine and his battles here on earth. It is at this point that we finally begin to get a glimpse of what transpired in the past as Constantine and the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) discuss John's past and his desire to do good in the hopes of changing God's mind into allowing him admittance into Heaven.  More details of this transpire later in the film.Eventually Constantine's and Dodson's paths cross once again and they are led down the road that will help them both discover who was behind not only the death of Dodson's sister but the attempt to enter this mortal plane as well. It's a long path that leads them both, literally, to hell and back, but the journey they take is one filled with danger, fear and a believable story that draws the viewer in.The story itself here makes the film, offering a battle of good and evil on this plane that was formulated in the beginning with God and the devil. No balance of power is discussed, no self righteous name calling is produced, simply the battle that is fought is brought to our doorstep with all the souls on Earth hanging in the balance.The weakest point is Keanu Reeves. While I enjoy his work and think of him as a more accomplished actor than many give him credit for, he seem far too Neoish here. After three MATRIX movies, I see him in black and think of him there once more. He does a good job, as does Weisz, but I still have that mental image of him.The movie is well made with some great CGI effects that startle and frighten. The images of Hell are what one would expect as are the demons. But all are done with quality here.CONSTANTINE may not be the greatest movie ever made. But it is one movie that will entertain while you watch. And it may cause a few conversations to rise concerning God, the devil, Heaven and Hell. What more could you ask for in a movie?",5,HELL TO PAY,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,4271,"['Fortunately', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'son', 'discovered', 'comic', 'books', 'least', 'card', 'were', 'coming', 'out', 'time', 'so', 'doing', 'helped', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'cards', 'found', 'immersed', 'once', 'again', 'brightly', 'colored', 'world', 'comics', 'soon', 'discovered', 'comics', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'children', 'art', 'form', 'whole', 'other', 'world', 'graphic', 'storytelling', 'imagery', 'was', 'anything', 'there', 'exception', 'film', 'Tales', 'heaven', 'hell', 'battling', 'out', 'souls', 'humans', 'secret', 'government', 'agencies', 'allowed', 'people', 'extract', 'revenge', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'wrong', 'heroes', 'actually', 'killed', 'people', 'felt', 'was', 'interest', 'society', 'were', 'present', 'so', 'was', 'John', 'Constantine.The', 'comic', 'series', 'HELLBLAZER', 'was', 'story', 'John', 'Constantine', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'found', 'drawn', 'written', 'Garth', 'Ennis', 'took', 'legendary', 'status', 'fans', 'helped', 'increase', 'popularity', 'DC', 'Vertigo', 'brand', 'home', 'more', 'adult', 'oriented', 'comics', 'SANDMAN', 'When', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'interested', 'watching', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'take', 'chance', 'picking', 'up', 'trade', 'paperback', 'copies', 'series.The', 'film', 'John', 'Constantine', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'being', 'called', 'tenement', 'apartment', 'where', 'young', 'Hispanic', 'girl', 'been', 'possessed', 'knowledge', 'Constantine', 'able', 'bring', 'demon', 'young', 'girl', 'send', 'back', 'Hell', 'something', 'was', 'different', 'here', 'seemed', 'demon', 'was', 'enter', 'realm', 'leave', 'own.We', 'are', 'next', 'introduced', 'woman', 'who', 'leaping', 'death', 'top', 'building', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'dream', 'police', 'detective', 'Angela', 'Dodson', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'saw', 'death', 'twin', 'sister', 'Called', 'scene', 'solace', 'priest', 'later', 'hoping', 'will', 'allow', 'sister', 'be', 'buried', 'consecrated', 'ground', 'time', 'path', 'crosses', 'Contantine.Constantine', 'same', 'church', 'talking', 'gamble', 'God', 'devil', 'allowed', 'put', 'man', 'own', 'free', 'will', 'stake', 'side', 'might', 'try', 'influence', 'actions', 'man', 'was', 'allowed', 'be', 'plane', 'Someone', 'trying', 'break', 'deal', 'Constantine', 'find', 'out', 'whom.The', 'one', 'fault', 'film', 'assuming', 'know', 'know', 'Constantine', 'battles', 'here', 'earth', 'point', 'finally', 'begin', 'get', 'glimpse', 'what', 'transpired', 'past', 'Constantine', 'angel', 'Gabriel', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'John', 'past', 'desire', 'do', 'good', 'hopes', 'changing', 'God', 'mind', 'allowing', 'admittance', 'Heaven', 'More', 'details', 'transpire', 'later', 'film.Eventually', 'Constantine', 'Dodson', 'paths', 'cross', 'once', 'again', 'are', 'led', 'road', 'will', 'help', 'discover', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'death', 'Dodson', 'sister', 'attempt', 'enter', 'mortal', 'plane', 'as', 'well', 'long', 'path', 'literally', 'hell', 'back', 'journey', 'take', 'one', 'filled', 'danger', 'fear', 'believable', 'story', 'viewer', 'in.The', 'story', 'here', 'film', 'offering', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'plane', 'was', 'formulated', 'beginning', 'God', 'devil', 'balance', 'power', 'discussed', 'self', 'righteous', 'name', 'calling', 'produced', 'simply', 'battle', 'fought', 'brought', 'doorstep', 'souls', 'Earth', 'hanging', 'balance.The', 'weakest', 'point', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'enjoy', 'work', 'think', 'more', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'many', 'give', 'credit', 'seem', 'far', 'too', 'Neoish', 'here', 'three', 'MATRIX', 'movies', 'see', 'black', 'think', 'once', 'more', 'good', 'job', 'Weisz', 'still', 'have', 'mental', 'image', 'him.The', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'great', 'CGI', 'effects', 'startle', 'frighten', 'images', 'Hell', 'are', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'are', 'demons', 'are', 'done', 'quality', 'here.CONSTANTINE', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'movie', 'will', 'entertain', 'watch', 'may', 'cause', 'few', 'conversations', 'rise', 'concerning', 'God', 'devil', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'ask', 'movie']",Constantine

He has special powers to rid demons from earth and spends most of his time walking through the movie coughing up the results of years of smoking.  The story is simply Reeves trying to balance good and evil between God and Satan on earth.  He seeks out those old good-evil, angel-devil half breeds.  Some of his encounters are digitally amazing.  The story is mildly entertaining, but the effects are truly inspiring, if not nauseatingly inventive.  Reeves makes frequent trips to hell and the scenery is spectacular.

Rachel Weisz is actually surprisingly good in this movie and would have been better if she didn't have such a terrible co-worker but i guess there's nothing anyone can do about that so we'll move on to the plot.

907539,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0009KA7BS,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[3, 3]","I was actually really looking forward to seeing this movie. I loved the poster - it's not totally obvious first time round that Keanu actually appears in it. I'm also a big fan of the lovely Keanu. I'd never previously heard of the comic.I was kinda disappointed by the movie, and also found it really boring. It's got some cool effects, it's got a good cast, but nothing much happened for me. Keanu is great, and I was surprised I didn't find the continuous smoking a turn off, as I would normally. I'm sorry, I would not date a guy who smoked. But despite the constant chain-smoking throughout the first half of the movie, by the time the second half hits, he's too busy fighting demons to light up a cigarette.I liked Rachel Weiz's character in this, although boy, would I like to pluck her eyebrows for her!!! I wasn't so sure about the Keanu/Rachel pair up again, after what happened with Chain Reaction, but they didn't do too bad. There's no chemistry though. Also, Rachel makes a major fashion boo boo in this - she wears a white shirt with a black bra under through most of the movie. And then promptly gets wet/dunked in a bath etc. Deliberate? Could she not have worn a white bra? It was really Rachel in the scene where her character flies backwards through the building. This was achieved by strapping her to a chair on a track and moving the chair back really quickly. The surrounding office was later generated on computer to achieve the scene. She also went to the morgue as a part of the research into her character. A life-size replica of Rachel was made and used as the corpse of Angela Dodson's twin sister Isabel who committed a suicide.I've read quite a few of the press articles about this, and Gavin Rossdale (who's married to Gwen Stefani, for people who don't know) always seem to be chattering away about the movie. He hardly appears in it! He appears for a couple of scenes and that's about it! Satan appears in it for longer than him. A hard day's work that was!Apparently, after the credits, there's an epilogue to the action of the movie, with Constantine leaving his lighter on a gravestone, whereupon an angel appears. Of course, seeing it in the cinema, no one stays past the first name appearing on the credits, so I'll no doubt catch that bit on DVD. (There are no opening credits by the way, only the company logos, and the title, for people who tend to skip past the start credits on DVDs, like me.)The logos for Warner Bros, Village Roadshow Pictures, and The Donner's Company, all appear, smoulder and crumble in the hell setting.I thought the whole Hell scenes were done really well, quite a different take on normal scenes. Actually the only Hell scenes I can think of from other films is Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey! :) Or the Matrix movies, those were kinda hell-ish. Ooops, I didn't mean that! I like those!In the comic book ""Hellblazer"" on which the movie is based, the character of John Constantine is from Liverpool. In the movie, the character is from Los Angeles. It is widely believed that the character of John Constantine was changed to an American so that Keanu Reeves could play the role. The truth is the original script retained his nationality but got no response from producers. So the writer changed him to an American and the script quickly gained attention. Although the movie Constantine is based on the comic book Hellblazer, the movie title was changed because it was too similar to Hellraiser. The comic book itself was actually meant to be called Hellraiser, but Clive Barker came up with the title first.The character of Father Hennessy is a mixture of three of Constantine's allies from the comic book. They are Nige Archer who was a psychic, Ric the Vic who was a priest, and Header who was a portly substance abuser. And, like Hennessy, all are killed for being associated with Constantine.The tattoo on constantine's arms is the alchemical symbol of the Red King, which was worn (by him) for protection. It is ""the fire triangle with three radiating arrows below represents the ""Perfect Red King,"" the Sulfur of the Philosophers.""The ""Spear of Destiny"" prop is the same one as used in Hellboy. I have to admit I'd never previously heard of the spear used to kill Christ on the cross called by this before. I liked Stigmata, and there's a lot of religious imagery in that, but I don't think you're supposed to get most of the religious stuff in this. It's very different.A character named Ellie, who was a demon Constantine dealt with early on, was completely cut from the film. Francis Lawrence stated that she was left on the cutting room floor because he wanted Constantine to be completely alone when he meets Angela. He also stated that an unrated DVD would contain Ellie's scenes. Ellie was played by Michelle Mognahan.I'm still not sure what to think about this movie, it's one of those movies that doesn't know quite what it's supposed to be, and relies heavily on religious imagery. It was just OK, I guess. I reckon this will get a few bad reviews, simply because people won't 'get' it. I got the feeling that the film was also trying to portray that everything you know about religion is wrong.Oh, and if you're a fan of the comic book, you know you're going to probably hate this out of loyalty to the comic book, so it's probably best not to.",3,"Beware next time you have a bath, you might drop in on Hell",1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,5325,"['was', 'actually', 'really',

907541,ADTUS88NFTW23,B0009KA7BS,"Melkor ""dark lord""","[3, 4]","My introduction to Alan Moore's John Constantine character was in Neil Gaiman's ""Books of Magic"".  It was a series with incredible artists and writers, but the Constantine character from that story always stuck in my mind.  Later I picked up ""Hellblazer"", since I had become a huge fan of the edgy style of Ennis and Dillon.  After reading through those, along with Moore's ""Swamp Thing"", John Constantine grew to be one of my favorite comic characters.  I knew last summer that Keanu Reeves was going to play Constantine, so I had enough time to deal with the fact that this movie was not going to follow the comic.This leads to my advise for those who are fans of the comic.  If you can't watch this movie as an independent entity from ""Hellblazer"", you will hate the movie.  It doesn't really come close to the comic.  So, if you read that book and can't separate yourself, save your money.  This also means that I am going to review this film as though I were someone who knows hardly anything about the comic.I think the movie was o.k.  It was worth my money on a Friday night, or maybe a rental.  I'll deal with the negative points first.  Constantine isn't British, which I'm not too upset about.  Since they seemed set on casting Keanu as Constantine, I'm glad that he didn't play him British.  Have you seen ""Dracula"" or ""Much Ado About Nothing""?  I don't think I could have suffered through another film of Keanu struggling to do an accent.  Keanu's acting is not very solid in this film, though he's not as bad as a lot of people are saying.  I think he can, on occasion, act pretty well.  He's great in ""My Own Private Idaho"", ""Little Buddha"", and ""The Gift"".  Though, I think he rarely pulls off the action hero thing.  He was pretty good in ""Speed"", and in the first ""Matrix"" (since he barely had any lines).The movie itself jumps around a lot.  There are long spaces of nothing happening, and then suddenly a three minute action sequence or plot movement, followed by a lot of nothing again.  It doesn't flow very well as a story.  Characters pop in and out of the film without any real development.  What was the deal with the fat priest or the bowling ally guy?  Constantine's little side kick disappears for half the film and then comes back in the end when it's convenient.  There sure seems to be a lot of easy ways to visit hell. Speaking of that, I was not entirely impressed with hell.  It kept reminding me of the portrayal in that awful 1997 ""Spawn"" movie, with loud fire wind everywhere.  Finally, CG is not scary.  It can be (Gollum), but it takes a lot of money and time.  The bug demon made me and my friend and laugh pretty hard.  For a horror movie, I never really got the feeling that anyone was in real danger.  This was the director's first movie, and sometimes it shows.  His previous experience was making Will Smith and Britney Spears videos, so we're not talking about a Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry working on this movie.I give this movie a solid 3 stars, so there are some good points.  I really dig Gabriel, and thought that was a well thought out character.  Lucifer was menacing, though I think Viggo Mortensen in the ""The Prophecy"" was better portrayal of the character (since Lucifer is supposed to be a beautiful boy who can temp you).  Speaking of that, the plot was pretty close to ""The Prophecy"", but I can't say more without giving away plot points.  Anyway, if movies with magic, demons, hell, etc. interest you, ""Constantine"" isn't the best one for you to see; but it's not the worst either.  If you have nothing better to do, then go ahead and see it.  If not, I'm sure most people could probably wait to rent it.  It might even be one of those films that's a little better watching at home.",3,"Worth watching, but didn't blow me away.",1109030400,"02 22, 2005",2005,3744,"['introduction', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'John', 'Constantine', 'character', 'was', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'Books', 'Magic', 'was', 'series', 'incredible', 'artists', 'writers', 'Constantine', 'character', 'story', 'always', 'stuck', 'mind', 'Later', 'picked', 'up', 'Hellblazer', 'had', 'become', 'huge', 'fan', 'edgy', 'style', 'Ennis', 'Dillon', 'reading', 'Moore', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'John', 'Constantine', 'grew', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'comic', 'characters', 'knew', 'last', 'summer', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'Constantine', 'had', 'enough', 'time', 'deal', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'follow', 'comic.This', 'advise', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'comic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'independent', 'entity', 'Hellblazer', 'will', 'hate', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'close', 'comic', 'So', 'read', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'separate', 'save', 'money', 'also', 'am', 'going', 'review', 'film', 'were', 'someone', 'who', 'hardly', 'anything', 'comic.I', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'o.k', 'was', 'worth', 'money', 'Friday', 'night', 'maybe', 'rental', ""'ll"", 'deal', 'negative', 'points', 'first', 'Constantine', ""n't"", 'British', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'upset', 'seemed', 'set', 'casting', 'Keanu', 'Constantine', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'British', 'Have', 'seen', 'Dracula', 'Much', 'Ado', 'Nothing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'suffered', 'film', 'Keanu', 'struggling', 'do', 'accent', 'Keanu', 'acting', 'not', 'very', 'solid', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'think', 'can', 'occasion', 'act', 'pretty', 'well', 'great', 'Own', 'Private', 'Idaho', 'Little', 'Buddha', 'Gift', 'think', 'rarely', 'action', 'hero', 'thing', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Speed', 'first', 'Matrix', 'barely', 'had', 'lines', '.The', 'movie', 'lot', 'are', 'long', 'spaces', 'nothing', 'happening', 'then', 'suddenly', 'three', 'minute', 'action', 'sequence', 'plot', 'movement', 'followed', 'lot', 'nothing', 'again', ""n't"", 'flow', 'very', 'well', 'story', 'Characters', 'pop', 'film', 'real', 'development', 'What', 'was', 'deal', 'fat', 'priest', 'bowling', 'ally', 'guy', 'Constantine', 'little', 'side', 'kick', 'film', 'then', 'back', 'end', 'when', 'convenient', 'sure', 'be', 'lot', 'easy', 'ways', 'visit', 'hell', 'Speaking', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'impressed', 'hell', 'kept', 'reminding', 'portrayal', 'awful', '1997', 'Spawn', 'movie', 'loud', 'fire', 'wind', 'everywhere', 'Finally', 'CG', 'not', 'scary', 'can', 'be', 'Gollum', 'lot', 'money', 'time', 'bug', 'demon', 'made', 'friend', 'laugh', 'pretty', 'hard', 'horror', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'feeling', 'anyone', 'was', 'real', 'danger', 'was', 'director', 'first', 'movie', 'previous', 'experience', 'was', 'making', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'videos', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'working', 'movie.I', 'give', 'movie', 'solid', '3', 'stars', 'are', 'good', 'points', 'really', 'dig', 'Gabriel', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'character', 'Lucifer', 'was', 'menacing', 'think', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Prophecy', 'was', 'better', 'portrayal', 'character', 'Lucifer', 'supposed', 'be', 'beautiful', 'boy', 'who', 'can', 'temp', 'Speaking', 'plot', 'was', 'pretty', 'close', 'Prophecy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'points', 'Anyway', 'movies', 'magic', 'demons', 'hell', 'etc', 'interest', 'Constantine', ""n't"", 'best', 'one', 'see', 'not', 'worst', 'either', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'see', 'not', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'could', 'probably', 'wait', 'rent', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'one', 'films', 'little', 'better', 'watching', 'home']",Constantine

He is called upon to perform exorcisms: the first one of which is a direct steal from ""The Exorcism."" Constantine finds a child crawling along the walls of her bedroom like a crab while her mother and family say the rosary and pray until Constantine literally beats the demon out of her and onto a mirror, out of which the demon cannot escape: neat trick.Constantine is also a very sick guy and is given only a short time to live because of an advanced stage of lung cancer though he feels no compunction to stop smoking those unfiltered Chinese made cigarettes of his.One of the funky/unusual/cool things about this film is, if you are a Christian or know anything about Christianity or actually religion, the sheer amount of Christian iconography in this film will boggle your mind. There is more stuff on view here than a curio shop in Rome.After about 20 years of watching Keanu Reeves on the screen and scratching my head at the sheer audacity (remember him in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"") of his non-performances, I've either gotten used to him or gotten to appreciate him. I'm not sure which. And it started with the Matrix films in which he is not called upon to do much but look well groomed and serious.Rachel Weisz plays a cop who seeks help from Constantine to solve the murder/suicide of her twin sister. Weisz spends a lot of time in a wet tank top which is just fine with me though before undergoing a tub plunging scene she asks Constantine if she has to get naked and he says rather blandly, No. It is at this point that I realiz how sick from the cancer Constantine really is.Peter Stormare plays the Devil (yes, the real thing, not a demon) as a 70's Disco Dude and he is nasty and fun but it's probably Tilda Swinton as the angel-gone-bad Gabriel who steals the movie.""Constantine"" is not the best film ever made, but it is fun, the visual effects are first rate and you have Rachel Weisz cavorting in a wet tank top.

907548,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0009KA7BS,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[8, 9]","I've never read the Hellblazer comic, so fans looking to compare the two can move on.Are they gone?  Okay, let's talk about religion.I suspect a lot of folks didn't like this movie because they didn't understand it.  And the viewers who did understand it are probably offended by it.  Appreciating the film requires a pretty good grasp of pop-theology and Roman Catholicism, a combination you don't find in many people besides gamers.John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a former suicide that has been given another chance to walk amongst the living.  Like most pulp heroes, John is a chain smoker.  The twist here is that all the supposedly harmless smoking is a symbol of John's temptation by the vices of the flesh: as a result of his bad habit, he's dying from lung cancer.Tragic, yes.  But John knows for a fact he's going to hell.  You see, Catholic doctrine dictates that those who commit suicide go to hell.  This probably had to do a lot with the fact that martyrs in medieval times were torturing themselves in extremis until they died in twisted efforts to purify themselves.  And really, religion doesn't work all that well without living worshippers.  Thus the edict against suicide.During John's brief experimentation with killing himself, he was in hell for two minutes.  Two minutes is an eternity in hell, which looks like wherever you happen to be before you crossed over, only under the perpetual flames of a nuclear blast. Underneath all those flames and soot are the damned, gnawing and clawing each other.  It's all very Dantean.And yet John has been tasked with maintaining the balance, an eternal war beyond God's angels and the Devil's demons.  Neither is allowed on this plane of existence, so half-breeds roam the Earth instead.  Angels take the guise of humans (sans wings except for those who can see them) and demons possess people.The Exorcist established that possessed people stick to the ceiling and have blue veins and bad teeth.  John takes the roll of an exorcist, ensuring that the demons get too strong a foothold in our world.  Except that one of them tries to ""break out"" of a possessed little girl, which is a violation of the Divine Order.As an aside, the term ""plane"" was brought into popular culture through Michael Moorcock and his Elric series.  The movie uses the term liberally and it's unlikely that anyone but gamers will get it.The plot gets twisty from there.  Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), a pretty cop, has been unknowingly gunning down demons-in-human-form and feeling pretty guilty about it.  Turns out she's psychic. So is her twin, Isabel. And in order for the antichrist to return, he must be born through a psychic and ripped out of the womb by the Spear of Destiny.  That'd be the spear that pierced Christ's side.Whew, that's a lot to take in.All this culminates in John having to work twice as hard as he realizes demons aren't just trying to get into our world, they're already here and killing off the good guys.  After Angela's sister Isabel commits suicide to avoid becoming the antichrist's mother, Angela and John team up to try to stop the ensuing invasion.It soon becomes clear that the lines of good and evil are not so clearly drawn: angels do wicked things and devils come to the rescue. Waitaminute, haven't we seen this before?If it sounds familiar, it's because The Prophecy covered the same ground with the same characters: Gabriel, Lucifer, and a regular Joe who lost his faith in the middle.  The acting was better.  Lucifer was just plain creepy (played by Viggo Mortensen).  And Gabriel was played by Christopher Walken, who just rocks on toast in everything he's in.Instead, we get Peter Stormare, a Goodfellas version of Lucifer.  Tilda Swinton plays Gabriel, whose chief attribute is being androgynous-looking (see the movie Orlando). There are other quirky characters playing one-dimensional comic book types (including Pruitt Taylor Vince as a psychic priest), but they're all there to support John and get killed so he's really, really pissed when he fights the main bad guy. And of course there's the 21st century Kevin Costner of our time, Keanu Reeves.  Reeves' mumbling tested my patience and I missed out on a few important plot points because of it.  But he's merely a canvas for a bigger movie and it's unfair to overly criticize the film when ultimately Constantine's supposed to be a shlub with a bad habit.The director (Francis Lawrence) has fits of brilliance, including a scene where the holder of the Spear of Destiny walks down a road, causing a herd of cows to drop as he passes. Or Angela being sucked through wall after wall of a skyscraper, Forgotten-style, with John in hot pursuit. Or when John and Angela stand in front of a statue of the Virgin Mary to face off against hundreds of demons hovering in the darkness, just out of sight.It's easy to dismiss the movie as Van Helsing with demons.  Yes, there is a holy shotgun blowing up demons.  Yes, they do bless the sprinkler system and turn it into holy water.  So what?  This is pulp noir, dark stuff in Los Angeles, the City of Angels.  That Constantine dishes up a round of butt kicking along with its crazy theology only adds to the fun.",4,Dantean Butt Kicking Fun,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,5200,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read',

907553,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B0009KA7BS,Michael Zuffa,"[1, 4]","Yet another comic book movie graces the big screen in the adaptation of DC Comics's ""Constantine"".  John Constantine (Reeves) is cursed with the ability to see angels and demons in the world around us.  And they are everywhere.  As a child, he tried to kill himself rather than deal with what he saw.  He was unsuccessful, and now he is trying to atone for his suicide and win God's favor so that he may enter heaven upon his death.  Constantine does not really have faith though, and he finds himself tormented to one degree or another by the angel Gabriel (Swinton) and the demon Balthazar (Rossdale).  Oh yeah, and he has terminal lung cancer.  If that is not enough of a downer, Satan's son is trying to enter the ""real world"" and mess everything up.  With the help of Angela Dodson (Weisz), a Los Angeles cop, he just might be able to stop him, but it will not be easy.Keanu Reeves is still in ""Matrix"" mode, and Constantine is not too different from Neo, the character he played three times.  Unfortunately, that character is growing tiresome.  Reeves definately needs a more upbeat movie to work on next.  Swinton does a good job as the androgenyous angel Gabriel, helping and tormenting poor Constantine at the same time.  The real scene stealer is Peter Stormare as Satan himself.

907555,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B0009KA7BS,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[4, 4]","How would you feel if the rest of your future career in Hollywood was to be bent on the outcome of one film? You might have somewhat of a clue as to what Keanu Reeves might be feeling with his new action-thriller Constantine right now. Though he rose to superstardom with the lead role in the cult-classic film The Matrix in 1999, his other films since then have not been such sensational blockbusters, let alone cult classics. And even the two sequels to the famous science-fiction thriller were deemed disappointments, the last entry in the franchise not even garnering close to the box office receipts of the original years earlier, and that was before inflation. Should this chalk up another disappointment for `Neo', this could spell the end to his career, at least as far as action-thrillers go.The story centers on a man exorcising half-bred demons from the world in order to garner redemption from God to gain entry into Heaven. As a young man, John Constantine came to see things that no living human should ever be forced to see, half-bred demons and angels disguised as average earthly citizens influencing the actions and decisions of various human beings as part of a vast bet enraging between God and the Devil for the souls of all mankind. Sadly his parents only made the terrifying situation even worse for him when they had him admitted to a mental institution where he was given shock therapy and other sorts of cruel `treatments' in order to cure him of his disease. Ultimately John, not wanting to live with his `curse' any longer, commits suicide but is brought back to life against his will. In spite of the fact that he now has a new lease on life, John knows full well that no matter how he goes out he is going to end up in Hell for throwing away God's greatest gift to humanity, life itself, unless he finds some way to redeem himself and regain entry into Heaven. He decides to use his `gift' from God to engage half-bred demons and send them back to Hell where they belong, but because he does this only in his own self-interest, God has yet to grant him his `retirement' and he is quickly running out of time. Thanks to his avid chain-smoking habits since he was fifteen years old, his lungs are riddled with cancer and every day he coughs up blood, a reminder then his time is running out fast. Along comes Angela Dodson, a police detective investigating the supposed suicide of her twin sister, Isabel, at a mental institution where she had been committed, but she suspects that there might be something else behind her mysterious death. Seeking help from the loner Constantine, Angela becomes embroiled in a conflict as ancient as time itself, a war waged between Good and Evil for ultimate control of the fate of mankind.The story for Constantine is meant merely as a piece of pure entertainment, in the footsteps of The Da Vinci Code, and should not be taken for theological gospel by any sense of the word. But the film does have its fair share of sensitive, contemplative issues such as suicide, salvation, damnation, Heaven, Hell, God, Satan, Good and Evil which are all addressed quite profoundly in the script, though not at the level of which influence toward a particular side is projected onto its audience.  Constantine confidently acts as a film in which the ideas are placed in the back of your mind but are given enough space in which you are allowed to still make your own decisions on the issue. Though in the end this should be nothing more then a piece of worthy escapism with no serious religious substance to its storyline other then the basic principle assumptions of characters and items mentioned in its run, the feature's more significant moments are worth contemplating, be it on a much higher level of thinking.Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as John Constantine, one of the most unlikable comic-book superheroes you are ever going to come across, either on paper or on the silver screen. Constantine is coarse, cynical, sulky, standoffish, a chain-smoker, and reckless but, then again, how would you be if you knew that you were dying and ultimately going to end up to the place you had sent hundred of half-bred demons back down to, Hell. This is a picture of a man who has luck working against him in every conceivable way possible. He has always been alone in the world, not purely out of necessity but possibly for the fact that in the end he knows that this is going to be the path he alone must walk, but still being human he desires companionship. Rachel Weisz in a way pulls double-duty in the role of Angela Dodson, the police detective investigating the death of her twin sister, not surprisingly also played by Weisz, who she claims was not suicidal, though to be quite honest there is not much to the role of the dead twin who, conventionally, acts as a dead person should - limp and lifeless. Weisz works well in the role of a woman who is seriously conflicted, with both guilt and distress, over the death of her sister and the prospects of allowing to have had her committed to a mental institution for claiming to have witnessed images of half-bred angels and demons which she could also see but lied about in order to escape the same fate of incarceration. She desperately desires to make it up to her estranged twin sister but how does one save their sibling from an eternity of damnation in the fiery pits of Hell? Shia LaBeouf, who is coming along quite nicely as an effective performer in Hollywood, brings some much needed lighthearted moments to the rather bleak presentation in the role of Chas Chandler, Constantine's demon-slayer in training. Yes, Chandler's exit near the finale does seem to short change the audience who had built up so much hope and aspiration for this Constantine-in-training but, as is abundantly clear in the real world, life is not always as fair as we think it should be with terrible events befalling the righteous all too suddenly. It acts as a reminder of the cruel justice of life.It was actually quite clever, at least in terms of theological thinking, the way in which Tilda Swinton's take on the role of the Archangel Gabriel was presented, both in her presentation onscreen and in the way the character's actions are integrated into various parts of the script. The filmmakers, clearly not wanting to take sides on the debate of whether God or Heaven in general is a patriarchal or matriarchal in nature, give Gabriel a feminine-like quality, which is not all that uncommon with romanticized angels, while at the same time dressing him/her up in masculine business suits. It was also quite profound in the way Gabriel is dealt with near the end of the film. Though he/she has nothing but good intentions for releasing the son of Satan in order to bring about eternal salvation for mankind, one can never forget that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Peter Stormare, best known for his appearance in such Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer productions as Bad Boys II and Armageddon, enacts Satan just as you might picture him if he were based in the realm of the real world, which is that of the ultimate incarnation of evil but with a twisted comical sense of humor. The scene in which John Constantine calls upon Satan to prevent the end of the world is an intriguing piece of dialogue, probably having more to do with the way Stormare presents the character then anything else. Constantine, with every last ounce of strength he has in him, plays the fallen angel to the best of his weakness, his jealousy of the Lord and Heaven, to prevent Gabriel from unleashing his son, delivering mankind into eternal salvation and thereby losing the bet.Overall, Constantine will sadly leave those in search of arcane theological dissipation within the same context as The Passion of the Christ only relatively despondent but in part to its sophisticated blurring of the lines between theistic principles and Da Vinci Code embellishment to entertain even the least spiritual amongst us. In the long there are honestly only a scant few glitches located within the action-thriller that ultimately prevent it from achieving a higher status then it conveys to its audience but noticeable enough to be noted here. First off, how in God's name (no pun intended) did the `Spear of Destiny' wind up in Mexico City draped in a Nazi flag? In these kinds of situations it is perhaps better not to ask such detailed inquiries; it only ruins the effect, as The Da Vinci Code can attest to. Secondly, there were particular sequences and/or effects that failed to register any sense of logic or consistency to their inclusion and therefore would have been better off left on the cutting room floor. Take for example the scene in which Constantine upon leaving the gas station is attacked by a man, or whatever he was, made up entirely of insects and vermin. What was the exact point of this scene? And lastly, the lack of consonance within the rules of `the balance' as well as the theological elements on which the film's script bases itself upon, though not entirely damaging, does the hinder the audience's deep-seeded spiritual involvement in the premise as some would have wanted. On the other hand though, the special effects are positively sensational, especially concerning the filmmakers' interpretation of both Hell and Heaven as dark and light versions of our lives on Earth. Seriously, do not go into this film believing that you are about to receive the holy word of God himself or be shown down the path of true righteousness because that is not Constantine's purpose. It is meant as a little piece of escapism, of which it performs remarkably well as. There are some real issues dealt within this film's script but if you are truly searching for answers, or at least your investigative opinion on these thoughts, please visit church officials, such as the ones at your local parish, and discuss them in detail there without relying too heavily on this film for anything more then entertainment.",4,The Moose Hole - 'Constantine' Doesn't Go to

907557,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B0009KA7BS,Mir,"[0, 0]","Okay, let's face it, Keanu was not the guy who should have done this flick. Yes, he's pretty. But Constantine's character is really a down, dark guy doomed to hell. It needed an actor who could convincingly portray the emotions, that heavy negativism burying a nugget of hope that heaven might cut him some slack. I needed to see a face that reeked of internal putrefaction (the cancer, the despair) as well as obsession. We needed someone who could really dig in and pull out a performance. Keanu, photogenic as he is, even likable as he is, just can't do this. I don't believe him as a guy dying from lung cancer and well-acquainted with hellfire.Rachel Weisz and Tilda Swinton are good, Rachel VERY good. Tilda seems to be ready to make a career on playing gender-benders (see ORLANDO). She has the look for it, I guess.I kept thinking, too, that Satan should be much more beautiful (the fallen angel of light) and much more threatening. (This guy was creepy, but hardly to the levels of a Lucifer.)  This movie reminded me of The Prophecy meets The Matrix meets Spawn. (And wasn't Gabriel also human-hating in The Prophecy?) But Viggo Mortensen's Lucifer was better than this guys, hands down--seductive, yet repulsive. Bring Viggo back!The effects were good. I enjoyed the ""vacation gone really, really bad/The Day After"" vision of hell. The demons were well done. I liked the apprentice guy, and wish they'd let him do a bit more.Unlike some other reviewers, I liked the ending very much. Then again, I'm not averse to happy endings. :) In fact, I love them.

907561,A3B2P9JBRAUMGU,B0009KA7BS,M. M. Green,"[6, 7]","John Constantine is one character that you'll have fun watching over and over. I own this dvd and I'm glad I do. As many comic book fans probably already know John Constantine can be a man of mystery not just a man of the occult. He has many faces and shows in several different comic book plots in different forms. Overall, Constantine is a rough talking, rough riding, antihero we love to love. Is Constantine a villain or a hero? I don't think he fits into either category well because he's a mixture of both yet contains something more than those choices can provide. In this movie, you see the hoodoo believing, demon destroying, antihero Constantine. Constantine just wants to go to heaven and be done with the perils and pains of earthly life but fears that only Hell awaits him. He committed suicide as a teenager because the so-called gift of seeing demons felt more like a train wreck through fire. So Constantine decided to end the whole mess and got a first class ticket to Hell where the fire seers you to a crispy corpse.Constantine was brought back only to forever remember the glimpse of hell. He even has a one way open invitation back to Hell as soon as he dies. Now that's the kind of bargain no one wants. So Constantine basically spends most of his time sending demons back to Hell and fearing his beat down for doing it once he reaches Hell with them. His quirky sidekick Chas (who looks deceptively younger than he's supposed to according to the comic books) is played by Shia Labeouf. Shia does a good job in here for the little screen time he has but he proves himself to be worth watching. Midnight played by Djimon Hounsou looks so cool! He gives a great performance for his short screen time and adds a deeper flavor of coolness and masculine drive that powers the seriousness of the storyline home.I would suggest this movie for anyone who wants to see Keanu Reeves managing to make a decent Constantine. You won't be screaming in anger at this one, you'll want to get those cool tattoos on Keanu's forearms and chant, ""Into the light I command thee!"" over and over. Most importantly watch this movie if you want to know how to go to Hell just to see what it looks like. Constantine will show you how to do it, it involves a cat, some water.....hmmm anyways, watch to find out.",5,Constantine on how to go to  Hell and Back again!,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,2306,"['John', 'Constantine', 'one', 'character', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'own', 'dvd', ""'m"", 'glad', 'do', 'many', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'John', 'Constantine', 'can', 'be', 'man', 'mystery', 'not', 'just', 'man', 'occult', 'many', 'several', 'different', 'comic', 'book', 'plots', 'different', 'forms', 'Overall', 'Constantine', 'rough', 'talking', 'rough', 'riding', 'antihero', 'love', 'love', 'Constantine', 'villain', 'hero', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'category', 'well', 'mixture', 'yet', 'something', 'more', 'choices', 'can', 'provide', 'movie', 'see', 'hoodoo', 'believing', 'demon', 'destroying', 'antihero', 'Constantine', 'Constantine', 'just', 'go', 'heaven', 'be', 'done', 'perils', 'pains', 'earthly', 'life', 'fears', 'only', 'Hell', 'committed', 'suicide', 'teenager', 'so-called', 'gift', 'seeing', 'demons', 'felt', 'more', 'train', 'wreck', 'fire', 'So', 'Constantine', 'decided', 'end', 'whole', 'mess', 'got', 'first', 'class', 'ticket', 'Hell', 'where', 'fire', 'seers', 'crispy', 'corpse.Constantine', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'only', 'forever', 'remember', 'glimpse', 'hell', 'even', 'one', 'way', 'open', 'invitation', 'back', 'Hell', 'as', 'soon', 'Now', 'kind', 'bargain', 'one', 'So', 'Constantine', 'basically', 'most', 'time', 'sending', 'demons', 'back', 'Hell', 'fearing', 'beat', 'down', 'doing', 'once', 'Hell', 'quirky', 'sidekick', 'Chas', 'who', 'deceptively', 'younger', 'supposed', 'according', 'comic', 'books', 'played', 'Shia', 'Labeouf', 'Shia', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'Midnight', 'played', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'so', 'cool', 'great', 'performance', 'short', 'screen', 'time', 'deeper', 'flavor', 'coolness', 'masculine', 'drive', 'seriousness', 'storyline', 'home.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'managing', 'make', 'decent', 'Constantine', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'screaming', 'anger', 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 'get', 'cool', 'tattoos', 'Keanu', 'forearms', 'chant', 'light', 'command', 'thee', 'over', 'Most', 'importantly', 'watch', 'movie', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'go', 'Hell', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'Constantine', 'will', 'show', 'how', 'do', 'cat', 'water', '..hmmm', 'anyways', 'watch', 'find', 'out']",Constantine
907562,A1SCD2NYTIAQTY,B0009KA7BS,Mouldy Pilgrim,"[2, 4]","""Constantine"" is a movie with one cool premise, and some serious potential. Sadly, I thought much of it was wasted and lost in the final product. While this does not make the movie bad, it certainly left me feeling that it could have offered more.Basically, the story follows Constantine, a coughing, hacking and wheezing demon hunter, (he smokes too much), who is caught up in the cosmic battle between God and Satan when the delicate balance of power is upset. The shadowy agreement, which included no direct influence on humans, gets shattered and Constantine gets caught up in the whole thing.The acting is pretty much the same as anything you would expect from Keannu Reeves, and most of the acting was of the same or similar quality. Peter Stormare's portrayal of Satan was particularly laughable.The somewhat corny ending really did not suit the overall darkness of the movie and seemed to try and salvage something of a feel-good, ""good triumphs over evil"" message. I will not mention that ending for those who have not seen it.""Constantine"" was an average movie, but as I said, it could have been so much better.

Of late, I've been able to watch movies of his with my opinion of his talent secure--he will be awful, but since he's not such a bad guy personally, I'm not offended by the fact that he continues to get work (unlike such dweebs as Van Damme and Seagal, who are abominable at both acting and human being-ness).I first came to this realization in _Matrix Revolutions_, aside from being awed by the innovation that occured with writing and directing for Reeves--Neo spends almost the entire movie being unsure of the meaning behind most everything he says.  Since this is Reeves when acting anyway, I found this to be a wonderful way to make his lack of skills work for a movie.And all this let me sit back and not be bothered by his efforts in this film.  Granted, he has some 'tough guy' moments that are purely laughable, but instead I was able to get into the story despite him, and there are some real intriguing turns to this.  It would be tough to be particular about what impressed me about the storyline, for this would give away almost everything at the end, but I did like how the game between God and Lucifer for souls was played out here--how there are rules, and how neither entity is allowed to interfere directly in the human game of choice and assignment of the soul, but despite that there are some interesting moves and moves within moves to make the last 20 minutes or so of these really worth watching.So, to sum up--Keanu bad (acting wise), story thoughtful, but you do have to sweat it out until the end to get to the really interesting stuff.",4,The comfort behind Reeves' bad acting,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,1639,"['Lately', 'have', 'been', 'peace', 'just', 'how', 'lousy', 'actor', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'late', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'watch', 'movies', 'opinion', 'talent', 'secure', 'will', 'be', 'awful', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'guy', 'personally', ""'m"", 'not', 'offended', 'fact', 'get', 'work', 'such', 'dweebs', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Seagal', 'who', 'are', 'abominable', 'acting', 'human', 'being-ness', '.I', 'first', 'came', 'realization', '_Matrix', 'Revolutions_', 'aside', 'being', 'awed', 'innovation', 'occured', 'writing', 'directing', 'Reeves', 'Neo', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'being', 'unsure', 'meaning', 'most', 'everything', 'when', 'acting', 'anyway', 'found', 'be', 'wonderful', 'way', 'make', 'lack', 'skills', 'work', 'movie.And', 'let', 'sit', 'back', 'not', 'be', 'bothered', 'efforts', 'film', 'Granted', 'guy', 'moments', 'are', 'purely', 'laughable', 'instead', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'story', 'are', 'real', 'intriguing', 'turns', 'would', 'be', 'tough', 'be', 'particular', 'what', 'impressed', 'storyline', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'almost', 'everything', 'end', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'game', 'God', 'Lucifer', 'souls', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'here', 'how', 'are', 'rules', 'how', 'entity', 'allowed', 'interfere', 'directly', 'human', 'game', 'choice', 'assignment', 'soul', 'are', 'interesting', 'moves', 'moves', 'moves', 'make', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'really', 'worth', 'watching.So', 'sum', 'up', 'Keanu', 'bad', 'acting', 'wise', 'story', 'thoughtful', 'do', 'have', 'sweat', 'out', 'end', 'get', 'really', 'interesting', 'stuff']",Constantine

There they stand in front of what looks to be a religious type store that's closed for the evening with a life sized virgin Mary in the window. There Angela stands in front of the virgin Mother, Mary's arms stretched out & Angela appearing right in the middle of her arms. Its not doctrinally or historically correct on many things, of course its a fictional story. There ARE some things, though, that are accurate or hint at the knowledge that is coming to light, archaelogically & historically speaking.

Keanu Reeves, of all people, is cast as John Constantine: a man caught between Heaven and Hell.  Coming to the assistance of a detective (Rachel Weisz) whose twin sister committed suicide, Constantine faces off against half-breed demons and angels, embroiled in a plot to bring Hell to Earth.  Pseudo-catholic mythology aside, the film for the most part has an intriguing story, and the CGI effects are top notch.  Reeves is fine as an american accented John Constantine, while Weisz gives the best performance of the film.  Tilda Swinton is a nice touch as the asexual Gabriel, Bush singer Gavin Rossdale provides a few chuckles as a slimy demon, and Peter Stormare makes a great Lucifer.  As a whole, Constantine is a great mainstream thriller, even though it is a bit drawn out, and at times, a bit hokey.  With all the negative reviews that Constantine has garnered since it's initial release (from reviewers and comic fans alike), it's terribly underrated for what it really is.  Yes, John's not english or blonde (Sean Bean, who has been in everything from the first Lord of the Rings film to Troy, would have been an excellent choice had the film been more faithful to it's source material), but it's still better than many of the recent comic to film adaptations to be released as of late.

The movie presents itself as religious farce, but is simply too disconnected to achieve anything even remotely resembling coherence.  We are led to believe that demons actively battle angels on earth; yet, at the same time we are told that they cannot cross over.  We are provided with disconnected images involving various occult practices, including the use of water as an occult lubricant to facilitate travel to the other world, as well as the use of an old electric chair, formerly used to fry criminals, now used to achieve occult transcendence.  The journeys of the main character to hell are unconvincing, and the plot is virtually nonexistent.  Apparently, the Spear of Longinus, the spear used to pierce the side of Christ as he lay dying on the Cross and believed to give its bearer control over the destiny of the world, makes an appearance; however, the role of this occult relic in the main storyline seems contrived.  The movie claims to be based on Catholic theology, but entirely neglects the role of Purgatory in the process of Salvation.  Lucifer also makes an appearance, but his bare-footed character is not at all how I would imagine the Prince of Darkness.  God does not appear in this movie!

Seriously Hollywood more or less had two of the best comic book writers in the last thirty years to take from on this story and they just threw it away and went with what they thought was good.....And to top it off right before this movie came out DC made an offical version of this to be adapted to comic format and still scenes were cut and made differently before it went to the big screen....As, if to just rub salt in the wound that hollywood can't even follow it's own rules... For those who know nothing of Hellblazer or Constantine this movie can be outright confusing because the director assumed you've read the comic series which was a critcal mistake because this is a rather complex character.  Not, that it's impossible to make a two hour film on a long series comic character. Look to Spider Man 1 or Conan....Both took a well know character and took the basicness of what made them good and made a good film on them....As to those who gave this movie a 5 or 4 rating regardless of what they know about hellblazer are unfortinatly idiots that think Krull was great or Ghostbusters 2..... So, if you never were thrilled with Blair Witch, Ghostbusters 2, Aliens 3 ect....than you know to stay far far away from this film.....But, if you liked matrix 3, Robocop 3, Krull than by all means rent or buy this film.....",2,Hollywood had two great writers to use and yet prove they can burn the best,1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,2212,"['Alan', 'Moore', 'created', 'anti-hero', 'Saga', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'trench', 'coat', 'chain', 'smoking', 'english', 'man', 'would', 'become', 'one', 'back', 'stones', 'DC', 'Comics', 'modern', 'Vertigo', 'comic', 'series', 'push', 'John', 'further', 'realm', 'movie', 'based', 'Garth', 'Ennis', 'gave', 'new', 'darker', 'gritty', 'side', 'Constantine', '..', 'most', 'movie', 'based', 'Dangerous', 'Habits', 'Ennis', 'back', 'plots', 'issues', '1-10', 'other', 'various', 'parts', '200', 'saga', 'Hellbalzer', 'Yet', 'word', 'go', 'hollywood', 'able', 'take', 'simplist', 'things', 'just', 'throw', 'away', 'First', 'off', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'Contanine', 'being', 'British', 'Aye', 'film', 'was', 'overall', 'aimed', 'American', 'audience', 'when', 'been', 'bad', 'have', 'british', 'character', 'More', 'less', 'never', 'Americans', 'love', 'british', 'people', 'more', 'Keuna', 'Reeves', 'Seriously', 'Hollywood', 'more', 'less', 'had', 'two', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'writers', 'last', 'thirty', 'years', 'take', 'story', 'just', 'threw', 'away', 'went', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'good', '..And', 'top', 'off', 'right', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'DC', 'made', 'offical', 'version', 'be', 'adapted', 'comic', 'format', 'still', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'made', 'differently', 'went', 'big', 'screen', '.As', 'just', 'rub', 'salt', 'wound', 'hollywood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'follow', 'own', 'rules', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'Hellblazer', 'Constantine', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'outright', 'confusing', 'director', 'assumed', ""'ve"", 'read', 'comic', 'series', 'was', 'critcal', 'mistake', 'rather', 'complex', 'character', 'Not', 'impossible', 'make', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'long', 'series', 'comic', 'character', 'Look', 'Spider', 'Man', '1', 'Conan', '.Both', 'took', 'well', 'know', 'character', 'took', 'basicness', 'what', 'made', 'good', 'made', 'good', 'film', '.As', 'who', 'gave', 'movie', '5', '4', 'rating', 'regardless', 'what', 'know', 'hellblazer', 'are', 'unfortinatly', 'idiots', 'think', 'Krull', 'was', 'great', 'Ghostbusters', '2', '..', 'So', 'never', 'were', 'thrilled', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Ghostbusters', '2', '3', 'ect', 'know', 'stay', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'film', '..But', 'liked', '3', 'Robocop', '3', 'Krull', 'means', 'rent', 'buy', 'film', '..']",Constantine

My status as a KR fan completely aside (and undiscussed) is irrelevant.

I absolutely adore Rachel Weisz without qualification. (KR's career has been attended by so much controversy I just abstain). I feel the chemistry is sufficient, sorry I can't say more, but again put this in context - I still absolutely love this movie for some indefinable subliminal (or sublime) factor I can't put into words.

In walks Rachael Weisz playing both parts of twins trying to figure out why one of the twins committed suicide.  Of course the rest of the movie is demons trying to kill Constatine to keep him from finding out the truth.The movie is short on story and long on special effects.  the special effects are cool to watch and the film does well on this alone, but the special effects can't carry this epic and starts to fail miserably after a short while.

If you like semi-scary stuff with a conceptualized Heaven/Hell ""Spiritual warfare"" theme and you don't mind ""comic book movies"" then you should enjoy this.Reeves always gets his share of criticism for his acting or lack thereof, but he actually isn't bad in this - his character reminded me of the X-files' Fox Mulder, except darker with more character flaws. But it fit his mumbling stoic delivery better than ""Neo"" from the Matrix. His relationship with the female lead, played well by Weisz, is also very reminiscent of a post-X-files Platonic relationship. Their characters experience multiple fated meetings as the story unfolds which are warm and humorous.Reeves character, John Constantine, is an exorcist who seems to hate evil more than he loves good. He has experienced hell and fights against it's inhabitants, but he stubbornly rejects the self-sacrifice he knows he must make to attain paradise. Instead he embraces a suicidal lifestyle unbecoming of a true angel or saint. He becomes a boorish, grumpy chain-smoking ""hired-gun"" for the good guys rather than a virtuous, God-fearing hero. This is in part related by a very complex rendition of the Archangel Gabriel. He (or is it she?) is shown as being over-zealous to reveal both divine mercy and divine judgement on the entire world and plays a part in the very well-constructed climax of the film which left me guessing until the very end.There's some cheesy dialogue throughout and some incredible special effects that some may find to be over-blown.

After watching the movie and then reading a couple of the incredibly LONG reviews left on this site I realized that my initial thought of rating this movie a ""1"" really wasn't fair.  The movie is a decent action/sci fi flick with a truly memorable and notable performance by Rachel Weisz, and even some decent acting work by the Angel Gabriel.  The plot was simplistic but interesting, the animation was pretty good too.  I've read a lot of reviews where people bashed the animation as being ""computer-generated"", my view is that unfortunately (or not) there aren't any real demons, incubi, imps, devils etc and so....what can you do other than use computer generation?  Yes, you can tell it's computer generated...but then again who really thought Neo was doging those bullets in his famous move in the Matrix.  Suspension of disbelief is necessary.Reeves was a little uninspired in this movie.  I guess his acting job was decent but nothing compared to the Matrix.  Of course the entire movie was nothing compared to the matrix. In fact it would be a travesty to make any comparison between the two.  So in essence don't expect ""The Matrix"" and if you like SciFi/Action I think you'll be decently amused.  It was about as good as HellBoy or Dawn of the Dead.  I wouldn't reccomend spending the $8+ bucks/person to watch it on the big screen though.  If you're a big SciFi/Action movie fan then buy it the first week it's released at WalMart for the introductory low price $13.99.  It does have some limited rewatchability.

However, I took that as a good thing, since I had an open mind about this movie, not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised in finding myself liking the movie while I was viewing it.John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), as a child could see demons walking the earth, and was terrified of it. He tried to commit suicide and therefore knows that he will go to hell when he dies. Having seen hell, when he grows up, he decides to help people by removing demons through exorcisms and such. Now we meet Angela (Rachel Weisz), a cop who is trying to find the reason for her twin sister's death. While watching a surveillance video of her sister Isabel before her death, Isabel mentions the name `Constantine'. Therefore, Angela meets Constantine and together, they discover what's really going on, and try to stop it before it's too late.For a debut, director Francis Lawrence did an excellent job on this film. The special effects are amazing (there are so many good ones that I can't pick out any in particular). Keanu Reeves does his usual in this movie as he did in the Matrix. It's not that he didn't act well, but he is playing the same kind of roles lately, it wasn't a big surprise that he could pull this off. Rachel Weisz acted well for her role, as did the rest of the cast.

907598,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,B0009KA7BS,Richard J. Brzostek,"[8, 10]","""Constantine"" is an unusual spiritual film, which portrays frightening demons and serene angels in a world where heaven and hell are unquestionable realities.  John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is an expert in demonology and occult matters.  He performs exorcisms and is all too familiar with hell and non-Earthly entities.  The special effects are amazing in showing all sorts of demons and John's battles with them.The movie incorporates some details of the legendary spear of destiny, which is an actual artifact.  The spear pierced the side of Jesus Christ, is what actually killed Him, and not the crucifixion itself.  The film plays on the idea that the spear point is recovered in the ruins of an old church in Mexico wrapped in a Nazi flag (Hitler did in fact seize the artifact from a museum).  The story goes whoever holds the spear can control the fate of the world.Between the spear being found, and increase in demon activity on Earth, and John trying to send the demons back to hell, we have a woman.  The woman is a twin, whose sister was either killed by demonic forces or committed suicide.  As the sister had a gift and could see things others could not (various spirits without bodies), she was thought of as strange her whole life.  This resulted in her being institutionalized, which is no real surprise as psychiatrists are really nothing more than keepers of those society would rather not deal with or sadly enough, those with a different reality.  John tries to help her figure out what really happened to her twin as the fate of the world, as well as his future, all depends on it, even if he does not realize it at the time.  ""Constantine"" is a very creative film and interestingly enough, based on a comic book; I would highly recommend it for those looking for a truly unusual spiritual thriller.",5,A truly unusual spiritual thriller in a world where heaven and hell are unquestionable realities,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,1823,"['Constantine', 'unusual', 'spiritual', 'film', 'frightening', 'demons', 'serene', 'angels', 'world', 'where', 'heaven', 'hell', 'are', 'unquestionable', 'realities', 'John', 'Constantine', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'expert', 'demonology', 'occult', 'matters', 'exorcisms', 'too', 'familiar', 'hell', 'non-Earthly', 'entities', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'showing', 'sorts', 'demons', 'John', 'battles', 'them.The', 'movie', 'details', 'legendary', 'spear', 'destiny', 'actual', 'artifact', 'spear', 'pierced', 'side', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'what', 'actually', 'killed', 'Him', 'not', 'crucifixion', 'film', 'idea', 'spear', 'point', 'recovered', 'ruins', 'old', 'church', 'Mexico', 'wrapped', 'Nazi', 'flag', 'Hitler', 'did', 'fact', 'seize', 'artifact', 'museum', 'story', 'spear', 'can', 'control', 'fate', 'world.Between', 'spear', 'being', 'found', 'increase', 'demon', 'activity', 'Earth', 'John', 'trying', 'send', 'demons', 'back', 'hell', 'have', 'woman', 'woman', 'twin', 'sister', 'was', 'either', 'killed', 'demonic', 'forces', 'committed', 'suicide', 'sister', 'had', 'gift', 'could', 'see', 'things', 'others', 'could', 'not', 'various', 'spirits', 'bodies', 'was', 'thought', 'strange', 'whole', 'life', 'resulted', 'being', 'institutionalized', 'real', 'surprise', 'psychiatrists', 'are', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'keepers', 'society', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'deal', 'sadly', 'enough', 'different', 'reality', 'John', 'help', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'twin', 'fate', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'future', 'even', 'not', 'realize', 'time', 'Constantine', 'very', 'creative', 'film', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'looking', 'truly', 'unusual', 'spiritual', 'thriller']",Constantine

It's not that I'm a big Keanu fan (though I do think that folks were undeservably harsh on him in the Matrix sequels), or a Rachel Weisz fan (she's cute and all, but I've not seen her in much outside of this movie and the Mummy to judge her talent by), but I was interested in seeing a less ""mainstream"" comic book movie, shall we say? It's a comic book movie without the (anti)hero being a superhero.So, how was it? The pace was slow and sedate, for the most part, punctuated with scary/horror bits that keep things moving. It's almost as if I should be calling this a horror/drama. I'm not going to get into a discussion of the plot, so there won't be any spoilers here...let's just say that the premise is geared very much towards Catholics, more than anything else...no discussion of other religions, and all the Catholic religious trappings are on full display. The special effects are on the same level as the Mummy. Keanu gets to display a fuller range of human emotions than he did in the Matrix, and Rachel turns in a reasonable performance. Everyone else involved is turning in smaller, supporting role performances. Gavin Rossdale of the band Bush plays Balthazar, a demon type. The cinematography was OK, and the sound quality was good, though they did not use surround sound to its full potential I thought.Would I recommend it? Perhaps for rental.

907600,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B0009KA7BS,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[6, 7]","For fans of the comic book on which this movie is based -- ""John Constantine: HELLBLAZER"" -- it will doubtless be a disappointment. I myself am an avid reader of said comic, and when I think of how much better the movie could have been...SHOULD have been...it makes me a little sad. For one thing, the John Constantine of the comic lives in London, not Los Angeles, and this is a critical difference, both for the character and the story. Constantine is supposed to be British through and through, and turning him into an American -- even worse, a Californian -- just destroys the whole foundation of the character. Putting a gun (a crucifix gun?) in his hand puts the final nail in this coffin...the John Constantine I used to read about never used guns.  He never had to.The storyline they chose to adapt is one of the best of the whole series, the ""Dangerous Habits"" story in which Constantine, a lifelong smoker, is diagnosed with lung cancer, and spends the rest of the story wrapping up his affairs on Earth before taking the trip he knows he is destined for.  The movie adaptation, however, borrows only slightly from this story and then throws a bunch of predictable Hollywood crap into it to botch it up. It looks like they tried to mix the subtleties of ""Hellblazer"" with the over-the-top action of ""Blade,"" and the result is a hodge-podge mix of horror and action which really doesn't fly -- at least, not in terms of what John Constantine's followers from the comics might expect. ""Hellblazer"" is, in the end, a character-driven story more than an action story, and there's precious little character to be found in the film. And, if you know and love John Constantine as I do, the last shot of the film will leave you, as it did me, cursing at the screen in rage.Taken on its own, if I ignore the comic for a few moments, the film isn't a bad one.  The effects are well-done, and the story clips along nicely.  The visions of Hell were detailed and gruesome, and I appreciated the effort that went into them.  Keanu doesn't fully convey the nature of the lead character, but he also doesn't lapse into his usual lazy style -- not a single ""whoa"" moment to be found in the whole movie!  The real star, for me, was Rachel Weisz, as Angela.  She pretty much stole every scene she was in, and was clearly the better actor of the two leads.  Another highlight in terms of acting was Tilda Swinton as the Archangel Gabriel, trapped on Earth and giving Constantine advice on how to redeem himself.  Swinton lends a cold, androgynous quality to the angel which was quite remarkable.  There are also a few really good ""gotcha"" moments, especially for Constantine, moments when his character did glimmer through a bit.Basically, ""Constantine"" is a good action movie with horror overtones.  Those going to see it expecting nothing more than this will likely be pleased.However, those seeing it hoping for a decent adaptation of the comic book are going to be let down in a big way. This Constantine has an American accent, he uses lots of guns, and he isn't as blithe or as harsh as he could be.  In short, he's not OUR Constantine.And that last shot in the film...oh, I could just spit fire over that one.",3,"Disappointing adaptation, but worth watching...once.",1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,3207,"['fans', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'John', 'Constantine', 'HELLBLAZER', 'will', 'doubtless', 'be', 'disappointment', 'am', 'avid', 'reader', 'said', 'comic', 'when', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'sad', 'one', 'thing', 'John', 'Constantine', 'comic', 'lives', 'London', 'not', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'critical', 'difference', 'character', 'story', 'Constantine', 'supposed', 'be', 'British', 'turning', 'American', 'even', 'worse', 'Californian', 'just', 'whole', 'foundation', 'character', 'Putting', 'gun', 'crucifix', 'gun', 'hand', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'John', 'Constantine', 'used', 'read', 'never', 'used', 'guns', 'never', 'had', 'to.The', 'storyline', 'chose', 'adapt', 'one', 'best', 'whole', 'series', 'Dangerous', 'Habits', 'story', 'Constantine', 'lifelong', 'smoker', 'diagnosed', 'lung', 'cancer', 'rest', 'story', 'wrapping', 'up', 'affairs', 'Earth', 'taking', 'trip', 'destined', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'however', 'only', 'slightly', 'story', 'then', 'bunch', 'predictable', 'Hollywood', 'crap', 'botch', 'up', 'tried', 'mix', 'subtleties', 'Hellblazer', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'Blade', 'result', 'hodge-podge', 'mix', 'horror', 'action', 'really', ""n't"", 'fly', 'least', 'not', 'terms', 'what', 'John', 'Constantine', 'followers', 'comics', 'might', 'expect', 'Hellblazer', 'end', 'character-driven', 'story', 'more', 'action', 'story', 'precious', 'little', 'character', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'know', 'love', 'John', 'Constantine', 'do', 'last', 'shot', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'did', 'cursing', 'screen', 'rage.Taken', 'own', 'ignore', 'comic', 'few', 'moments', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'one', 'effects', 'are', 'well-done', 'story', 'clips', 'nicely', 'visions', 'Hell', 'were', 'detailed', 'gruesome', 'appreciated', 'effort', 'went', 'Keanu', ""n't"", 'fully', 'convey', 'nature', 'lead', 'character', 'also', ""n't"", 'lapse', 'usual', 'lazy', 'style', 'not', 'single', 'whoa', 'moment', 'be', 'found', 'whole', 'movie', 'real', 'star', 'was', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Angela', 'pretty', 'much', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'was', 'clearly', 'better', 'actor', 'two', 'leads', 'highlight', 'terms', 'acting', 'was', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Archangel', 'Gabriel', 'trapped', 'Earth', 'giving', 'Constantine', 'advice', 'how', 'redeem', 'Swinton', 'cold', 'androgynous', 'quality', 'angel', 'was', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'really', 'good', 'gotcha', 'moments', 'especially', 'Constantine', 'moments', 'when', 'character', 'did', 'glimmer', 'bit.Basically', 'Constantine', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'horror', 'overtones', 'going', 'see', 'expecting', 'nothing', 'more', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'pleased.However', 'seeing', 'hoping', 'decent', 'adaptation', 'comic', 'book', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'big', 'way', 'Constantine', 'American', 'accent', 'lots', 'guns', ""n't"", 'blithe', 'as', 'harsh', 'could', 'be', 'short', 'not', 'OUR', 'Constantine.And', 'last', 'shot', 'film', 'oh', 'could', 'just', 'spit', 'fire', 'one']",Constantine

I realize the film may not compare to the comic book, but I am judging the film alone.  As far as I am concerned, the film was one of the sleepers of the year.John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is an exorcist.  His death from lung cancer is getting closer and closer to his soul and John's guaranteed a ""Go to Hell and Do not Pass Go"" card when he dies because he attempted suicide when he was very young--and actually died for a short time.Angela (Rachel Weisz) is a cop who can pick a serial killer out of a crowd and shoot them.  She sees things, though she denies it. When her twin sister died of suicide in a mental hospital, She believes some other evil forces were at play because her sister would never have done something like that.Angela learns about Constantine from a priest and goes seeking him for help.  Though a cop, she doesn't know about the daily struggle Constantine goes through to keep the balance between Good-and-Evil and the infestation of half-demons in the world.Demon activity is increasing in LA and it's harder to kick those bad boys back to Hell.  Turns out, a homeless man named Francisco has discovered the Spear of Destiny in a remote Mexican church and is under the Devil's instructions to bring the spear to LA.  If Francisco makes it, Hell's going to win the balance.  As he gets closer to LA, things get even more dangerous.  Constantine and Angela have to team up to fight the forces of evil.This is one rare instance where I liked the book, the movie, and the DVD.

premise but falters in its' delivery.The story involves one John Constantine(Keanu Reeves)who has always had the ability to see things people weren't ""meant to see"".He has done alot of bad things in his life and he has tried to atone for them by working against evil so when he goes his path will lead up and not down.One day he is approached by a police woman named Angela Dodson(Rachel Weisz)to help her regarding her twin sister's untimely death;a plunge off of a roof.At first John balks but relents,soon realizing there is more to the death than meets the eye.John journeys to the other side and back and even assists Angela in doing the same,but they realize too late that her sisters death was basically a ruse to get at Angela.John learns that the archangel Gabriel is actually working with the son of the devil to unleash his progeny onto the world.In order to do this Angela becomes the host for the child and the angel will use the ""spear of destiny""(the actual tip of the lance that was used to kill Jesus on the cross)to open her womb and release evil to rule man.Gabriel reckons that only those that survive the time to come will be worthy of God's real salvation.In the meantime John has summoned the Devil himself in a last ditch attempt to foil the Devil's son and the archangel's plans.The Devil indeed stops the birth and renders the angel wingless and earth bound.He returns to John who asks that Angela's sister be let free from Hell in his stead.This is a sacrifice and the Devil has been tricked but in one last effort to keep John from going heavenward,he removes the lung cancer that is killing him and keeps him earth bound to live out his life;hoping one day he will slip up and be his forever.The movie has ALOT of promise throughout with an interesting plot of good versus evil playing out between a man desperate to be redeemed and the evil that would take over the world.The special effects are well done especially in the fight scenes and those involving the glimpses of Hell.However the side plots of Angela and her sister,his side kick Chas Kramer(Shia LaBeouf),his priest friend Father Hennessy(Pruitt Vince)and other characters are just dealt with so heavy handedly,that the plot's narrative flow suffers considerably everytime we go from the action scenes and back to the plot/character advancement.It's a stop/start of a roller coaster ride that detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film.The only three characters I found engaging at all and enhanced the film to any degree,besides Reeve's Constantine,were John's friend Scavenger(Jesse Ramirez),Gabriel(Tilda Swinton) and a beautifully played evil Satan by Peter Stormare.The others were just nondescript window dressing.Technically this film has been transferred well and is presented in its wide screen format.Extras include 18 minutes of so called ""additional scenes"" which are nothing other than expanded or alternate scenes;with or without commentary.There is also the theatrical trailer.This DVD is actually Disc One of the original two disc release version,just so you know.In conclusion I found Constantine one with a unique and different take on the whole Angels versus Demons,good versus evil chestnut,but overall the plot is a roller coaster of stops and starts which detract from its flow and overall enjoyment;despite the good S/FX.It could/should have been better.I recommend it as a little above average.",3,3 1/2 stars-More promise than results!,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,3555,"['Feb/2005', 'released', 'movie', 'Constantine', 'based',

907605,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0009KA7BS,Robert Moore,"[21, 28]","First, let me encourage anyone seeing this film to stay until the very end of the closing credits.  Yes, there is a bit of an add on at the very tail.  Walk out early and you'll miss it.I have to start off by confessing that I have never read any of the Hellrazer comics, so I had no prior expectations going into this film.  My experience of the film, therefore, will necessarily be different from those who had contesting conceptions of John Constantine.  All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie, though with a couple of major reservations.First, the good.  This is a great looking film, with a host of superb special effects and sets.  The Los Angeles of the film is very much the same Los Angeles of TV's ANGEL, dark, dingy, inelegant, the antithesis of the L.A. of Randy Newman's video ""I Love L.A.""  I liked the basic premise of the film:  John Constantine is an exorcist who is damned because he killed himself when younger before being resuscitated two minutes later, but enough in Catholic theology to make him permanently damned.  Again, parallels with TV's ANGEL, where the hero has committed unspeakable crimes, has become an irretrievably damned vampire, and yet as a vampire with a soul has regained a conscience and strives to balance out the evil he has brought into the world.  Fans of the comics will point out that the comic preceded the TV show, but I will point out two things.  First, it is entirely possible that the comic had some influence on the show (creator Joss Whedon is an avid comics fan).  Second, the TV show could have exerted influence on the movie (in literary circles it is not uncommon to read articles like ""W. B. Yeats influence on Blake,"" the idea being that the later poet, by appropriating and reinterpreting aspects of the earlier poet's work, influences the way that their work continues to be perceived).  I think the parallels will be obvious and difficult to ignore for anyone familiar with the TV show and watching the movie with or without prior knowledge of the comic.  Another great positive in the movie is the wonderful presence of Rachel Weisz, a beautiful and talented actress who brings far more ability to the role than is required by the genre.  Peter Stomare also has an interesting turn as Lucifer.  Most of the cast, in fact, is excellent.  The story was interesting as well.  In fact, one of the big problems I have with movies that depart from reality is that usually the premises of the film fall apart within only a few seconds thought.  Take THE ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND.  An interesting film, but if you think about the central premise, the absurdity of it becomes blatant almost immediately, quite apart from whether it is possible.  The very notion that memories can be isolated from all of their social connections is silly in the extreme (and in that movie, the Kate Winslet character, sans memories, goes to the apartment building of her former boyfriend, only to be recognized and addressed by someone who still possessed all of his memories-in other words, you can't erase memories not simply because it isn't physiologically possible, but it isn't sociologically possible).  But CONSTANTINE, while if you pushed it really hard might not hold up, nonetheless holds up if you push it only a little bit, which is much better than most other films in the genre.  From beginning to end, it was an enjoyable story.Now the bad.  First and foremost there is Keanu Reeves, one of the great mysteries of the cinema.  He is relatively likable, and definitely attractive, but he is without any possible doubt one of the least talented leading actors in the history of the movies.  He is profoundly inept at delivering lines, and lacking in the powerful screen presence that some other untalented leading actors possess.  For instance, John Wayne was not a great thespian, but he had an overwhelming presence onscreen that more than made up for a lack of acting ability.  Many actors bring more to a role than they find on a page.  Reeves leaves on the page much that he should have incarnated in his performance.  His wooden delivery of lines is astonishing for its sheer awfulness.  I'm baffled as to why he was cast in the role.  Perhaps others turned it down, but I kept wondering what the movie would have been like with a Hugh Jackman or Jeremy Northram or Christian Bale would have been like.  Or even a good actor who isn't quite right for the role, but has considerable ability, like Edward Norton.  Or even Mark Wahlberg.  I will say this:  this is at least a better movie than the last two MATRIX movies, though I'm not sure that Reeves can be given any of the credit.  Far an away, Reeves is the single biggest thing wrong with this film.  I was also very disappointed with the film's use of Tilda Swinton, whom I have long considered one of the most underutilized actresses in film.  As the mildly androgynous Gabriel (I wonder if her role in ORLANDO put the casting director in mind of her) she is uncharacteristically awful.  Not to worry though, she will be back later in the year in the plumy role of Jadis the White Witch in THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, the top fantasy film of the year.Also like ANGEL, the movie is stuffed with utterly awful theology.  On the TV show, I was as someone trained in philosophy utterly appalled at the Buffyverse idea of a detachable soul as well as other randomly utilized theological ideas.  In CONSTANTINE, there is some adherence to traditional Catholic theology, especially in regard to suicide, but much of the rest of the film embraces some of the most condemned heresies in church history.  In particular, the film depends on a nave Manichaeism which depends on a dualistic vision of the universe as divided between God and Devil, whereas Christianity whether Catholic or Protestant is nondualistic, evil being conceived not as an entity actual in itself, but negatively as being the absence of God.  (BUFFY and ANGEL suffer from the same Manichaeism).  What I find troubling about this is the randomness of the world view in play.  The creators pick and choose among the ideas that they need, and in the end the film suffers as a result.  All films involve some decisions about the kind of world in which the film will take place.  I'm just bothered when the creation of that world is especially arbitrary.All in all, I enjoyed this film, and while I can understand the criticisms of it by those who come to it from the comics, I think that many of those who are unfamiliar with it will probably enjoy it.",4,A bit better than many of the reviews here would indicate,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,6554,"['First', 'let',

Keanu Reeves has done some decent work in a few of the movies I've seen, but he was not the right guy for the part of John Constantine, nor was Shia Lebeouf the right guy for the part of Chaz Kramer.The character of John Constantine, in the comics, is a weathered englishman with a horrible smoking habit who incurs the wrath of heaven, hell and earth alike with his efforts to protect the planet and in most cases, himself.  In my humble opinion, the right guy for this movie would likely have been James Marsters, Spike from the Buffy TV Series.  The character of Chaz, again, in the comics, is an old friend of Johns that has been through the wars with him, and most of the time not without putting up a fight of his own not to be involved.  So having this young kid hanging on the coattails of the Hellblazer and wanting to learn the tricks of the trade was simply horrifying to the fans of the comic series.The movie itself was nicely done, Rachel Weisz and Tilda Swinton were both great in this as were all the peripheral people who helped make the movie an enjoyable is not somewhat tedious (for comic fans hoping for something closer to the comic) watch.And please don't misunderstand, I'm not a Keanu hater, nor do I dislike Shia, his Greatest Game Ever Played was a great movie, it's just here, in this particular instance, I think that Hollywood should have tried a little harder to keep to the formula that made the comic such a success and they could only have done that with a slightly different cast.If you see it, you'll enjoy it, the flaws are pretty apparent, but it still rates a watch, although I have yet to see it a second time.",3,"Not for comic fans, but decent.",1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,1924,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'great', 'job', 'was', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'ravaged', 'story', 'was', 'originally', 'told', 'Hellblazer', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'still', 'been', 'better', 'not', 'completely', 'awkward', 'based', 'solely', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'wanted', 'casting', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'done', 'decent', 'work', 'few', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'guy', 'part', 'John', 'Constantine', 'was', 'Shia', 'Lebeouf', 'right', 'guy', 'part', 'Chaz', 'Kramer.The', 'character', 'John', 'Constantine', 'comics', 'weathered', 'englishman', 'horrible', 'smoking', 'habit', 'who', 'wrath', 'heaven', 'hell', 'earth', 'alike', 'efforts', 'protect', 'planet', 'most', 'cases', 'humble', 'opinion', 'right', 'guy', 'movie', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'been', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Spike', 'Buffy', 'TV', 'Series', 'character', 'Chaz', 'again', 'comics', 'old', 'friend', 'Johns', 'been', 'wars', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'putting', 'up', 'fight', 'own', 'not', 'be', 'involved', 'So', 'having', 'young', 'kid', 'hanging', 'coattails', 'Hellblazer', 'wanting', 'learn', 'tricks', 'trade', 'was', 'simply', 'horrifying', 'fans', 'comic', 'series.The', 'movie', 'was', 'nicely', 'done', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'were', 'great', 'were', 'peripheral', 'people', 'who', 'helped', 'make', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'somewhat', 'tedious', 'comic', 'fans', 'hoping', 'something', 'closer', 'comic', 'watch.And', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', ""'m"", 'not', 'Keanu', 'hater', 'do', 'dislike', 'Shia', 'Greatest', 'Game', 'Ever', 'Played', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'just', 'here', 'particular', 'instance', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'should', 'have', 'tried', 'little', 'harder', 'keep', 'formula', 'made', 'comic', 'such', 'success', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'done', 'slightly', 'different', 'cast.If', 'see', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'flaws', 'are', 'pretty', 'apparent', 'still', 'rates', 'watch', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'second', 'time']",Constantine

Yet it was played out good nonetheless. I was drawn to see what would happen at the end and it was not predictable. I like the alternative ending as well on the deleted scenes but definitely the first ending is better.Don't take what a lot of these reviewers said so personally, fellow reader. Keanu Reeves is not as bad as they make him sound. He is actually pretty good in this movie and made this film quite interesting.

Here the incantations and paraphernalia of the Roman church have a great deal of efficacy in keeping the demonic forces Constantine encounters subdued and at bay.Strictly as a movie and not as a theological document, ""Constantine"" is a slightly better-than-average demonic thriller that goes back and forth between the world of humans and the shadowy netherworld inhabited by angels and demons and even a few creatures that fall somewhere in between.

We're more willing to accept the silliness of the premise knowing we have Reeves to guide us along the movie's path.  The special effects are impressive for the most part, with special credit going to the art designers for their imaginative view of hell (which looks much like a city after it's been destroyed by a nuclear explosion).  The film is, admittedly, too long and the nonsense quotient begins to run dangerously high long about the last half hour. But ""Constantine"" is, overall, sufficiently imaginative to keep us interested for most of its duration.",3,silly but better than some,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,1860,"['John', 'Constantine', 'chain-smoking', 'exorcist', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'left', 'live', 'already', 'destined', 'spend', 'eternity', 'hell', 'mortal', 'sin', 'committed', 'past', 'John', 'still', 'attempting', 'find', 'redemption', 'dedicating', 'battling', 'demonic', 'forces', 'exist', 'just', 'surface', 'known', 'reality', 'have', 'lately', 'been', 'making', 'greater', 'effort', 'cross', 'world', 'ours.I', 'imagine', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'must', 'be', 'rather', 'pleased', 'film', 'especially', 'considering', 'black', 'eye', 'suffered', 'hands', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'Here', 'incantations', 'paraphernalia', 'Roman', 'church', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'efficacy', 'keeping', 'demonic', 'forces', 'Constantine', 'encounters', 'subdued', 'bay.Strictly', 'movie', 'not', 'theological', 'document', 'Constantine', 'slightly', 'better-than-average', 'demonic', 'thriller', 'back', 'forth', 'world', 'humans', 'shadowy', 'netherworld', 'inhabited', 'angels', 'demons', 'even', 'few', 'creatures', 'fall', 'somewhere', 'role', 'not', 'far', 'removed', 'one', 'played', 'Matrix', 'movies', 'Keanu', 'once', 'again', 'functions', 'flawed', 'Everyman', 'hero', 'job', 'save', 'humanity', 'fate', 'worse', 'case', 'eternal', 'death', ""'re"", 'more', 'willing', 'accept', 'silliness', 'premise', 'knowing', 'have', 'Reeves', 'guide', 'movie', 'path', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'impressive', 'most', 'part', 'special', 'credit', 'going', 'art', 'designers', 'imaginative', 'view', 'hell', 'much', 'city', 'been', 'destroyed', 'nuclear', 'explosion', 'film', 'admittedly', 'too', 'long', 'nonsense', 'quotient', 'run', 'dangerously', 'high', 'long', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'Constantine', 'overall', 'sufficiently', 'imaginative', 'keep', 'interested', 'most', 'duration']",Constantine

So when this Francis Lawrence-helmed apocalyptic ""thriller"" topped weekend box office charts during its initial release, there's no way that money could've been directed towards the wrong feature, right?Yes and no. Let's start with the yes and get it over with. First off, very impressive visual effects. From the exorcism in the beginning of the movie, to our little hero's ventures into hell, to the wings of Gabriel. (Btw, it is very interesting to note how Gabriel is depicted as genderly ambiguous) Rachel Weisz has a very smooth way to her acting, as if she can do it so easily and flawlessly, you actually believe her character as an L.A. policewoman haunted by the mysterious death of her twin sister. Shia Laboeuf has a bit of a minor role, but he makes the most of it, shining with that unintended humor of his character, Constantine's ""slave"" chaffeur, Chas Kramer.Now, the no part. Hollywood seems to love declaring Keanu Reeves as our savior, the hero who didn't want to be a hero, called upon to save the world in one way or another. Whether it be in the machine-run era of ""The Matrix"", or a police officer trying to stop a madman from doing terrorist deeds in ""Speed."" And now, again, Reeves is called upon to save us from a clash between heaven and hell! John Constantine, a reluctant hero who has selfish ends, feeling sorry for himself, blah blah... Reeves may or may not put his all into this role, but as we all know by now, his best is never good enough. Constantine's persona is too flat, not captivating enough, further brought down by that annoying monotone drawl of Reeves' voice, and constantly needs support from the other characters in the film. Even the 20-second flashbacks of his childhood we see aren't enough to garner attention or pity for this soul branded for hell.The worst of it is that we expect this hero to maintain and carry along what little plot there is, stretched out over 2 hours. Honestly, folks, there is not much going on here. The filmmakers probably made about 5 storyboards and decided to make each one 20 minutes long. Inbetween the grueling beginning and the much-anticipated end, there's a whole lot of nothing eye-candy that manages to transfix into a bit of something, but not enough. Somehow we get from the death of a psychiatric patient to the end of the world...? And even when the movie's over, there's STILL unanswered questions. I don't mean, ""Oh, will Angela and John get together?"" nonsense but ""Uh what happened to the dead sister??"" No doubt saving for an equally painful sequel.So don't waste your money on this over-budgeted Keanu-promoting campaign...oh, oh I mean, thriller! ""The Seventh Seal,"" ""12 Monkeys,"" good flicks.

He's pretty tortured by it, and once, before he knew his seeing was a gift, he attempted suicide, was dead for two wags of a dog's tail, and, well, even though he lived, he's destined for hell for merely attempting a mortal sin. He's also graced with the knowledge that he's destined for hell.  The archangel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) tells him so. That's a helluva thing.So cop Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) walks into John's life. Her twin sister was a mental patient who climbed to the top of a skyscraper and swan dove.

907626,A1LHAXBM5GBJS2,B0009KA7BS,Scooter McGavin,"[0, 4]","Constantine is yet another movie based on a comic book that even most comic book nerd hadn't heard of.  So they take the story of John Constantine on the pursuit of riding the world of demons because of something long ago that bars him from the gates of heaven.  It's extra important to get in now because a large chunk of the residents of hell were put their by him.In the role of the title character is Keanu Reeves who will forever conjure up the thoughts of Theodore Logan no matter how serious the role.  Needless to say, the slacker surfer persona doesn't mesh well with the demon hunter.  On his quest in the movie, Constantine crosses path with the chick from The Mummy movies as a detective trying to prove that her twin didn't commit suicide.  And because ever good comic book character need a sidekick and Constantine has a cab driving apprentice played by the dude from one of the Disney Channel shows that I won't admit to watching.One of the few entertaining elements of the movie is the unintentional comedy most notable being every moment where Reeves tries to act, and be sure to watch out for Constantine's rubber ducky.  Equally questionable casting choice was the dude from Bush showing up as the bad guy.  It was extremely hard to be scared of him because whenever he comes on the screen I fell off the couch laughing.The only redeemable aspect of the movie was the scenes of hell.  They really captured what I assume hell to be, a very hot version of Earth with weird demon ready to rip the flesh.  The only part missing from my version of hell would be the members of the Backstreet Boys raping me for eternity while singing their songs.  In fact all the special effects were all well done.  Now if they can figure out to make a CGI Keanu Reeves and the movie might have been a lot better.The biggest crime of the movie is that they cut out what could have made the movie.  If you role through threw the delete scenes you find out about Constantine's tryst with a very hot (bad pun intended) half-demon who was cut out of various scenes in the movie.  If I were to ever make rules of making a good move, number one would be ""Never leave out the token hot chick.""  Because of that, this movie deserves to fail.",2,I've Got a Whole Theme Park full of Red Delights for You,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,2232,"['Constantine', 'yet', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'even', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'nerd', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'take', 'story', 'John', 'Constantine', 'pursuit', 'riding', 'world', 'demons', 'something', 'long', 'ago', 'gates', 'heaven', 'extra', 'important', 'get', 'now', 'large', 'chunk', 'residents', 'hell', 'were', 'put', 'role', 'title', 'character', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'who', 'will', 'forever', 'conjure', 'thoughts', 'Theodore', 'Logan', 'matter', 'how', 'serious', 'role', 'Needless', 'say', 'slacker', 'surfer', 'persona', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'well', 'demon', 'hunter', 'quest', 'movie', 'Constantine', 'path', 'chick', 'Mummy', 'movies', 'detective', 'trying', 'prove', 'twin', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'suicide', 'ever', 'good', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'need', 'sidekick', 'Constantine', 'cab', 'driving', 'apprentice', 'played', 'dude', 'one', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'admit', 'watching.One', 'few', 'entertaining', 'elements', 'movie', 'unintentional', 'comedy', 'most', 'notable', 'being', 'moment', 'where', 'Reeves', 'act', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'out', 'Constantine', 'rubber', 'ducky', 'Equally', 'questionable', 'casting', 'choice', 'was', 'dude', 'Bush', 'showing', 'up', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', 'extremely', 'hard', 'be', 'scared', 'whenever', 'screen', 'fell', 'off', 'couch', 'only', 'redeemable', 'aspect', 'movie', 'was', 'scenes', 'hell', 'really', 'captured', 'what', 'assume', 'hell', 'be', 'very', 'hot', 'version', 'Earth', 'weird', 'demon', 'ready', 'rip', 'flesh', 'only', 'part', 'missing', 'version', 'hell', 'would', 'be', 'members', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'raping', 'eternity', 'singing', 'songs', 'fact', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'Now', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'make', 'CGI', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better.The', 'biggest', 'crime', 'movie', 'cut', 'out', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'role', 'threw', 'delete', 'scenes', 'find', 'out', 'Constantine', 'tryst', 'very', 'hot', 'bad', 'pun', 'intended', 'half-demon', 'who', 'was', 'cut', 'various', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'ever', 'make', 'rules', 'making', 'good', 'move', 'number', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'Never', 'leave', 'out', 'token', 'hot', 'chick', 'movie', 'fail']",Constantine

Based on these great graphic novels. Constantine is about a hard-smoking & drinking guy who is not just an exorcist, but a guy who can see the Other Side.  In the film's mythology, both heaven and hell are in place with Earth.  Hell looks like L.A. during a nuclear holocaust.  So what else is new?Anyway, the film does have its share of plotholes which I found distracting.  These guys are scavenging around a junk yard in Mexico when a board breaks and a guy pulls out a knife wrapped in a Nazi flag and immediately becomes possessed by it.  The Sword is explained later in the film but not the Nazi connection.  How did it get there?  Did the Nazis use these artifacts?When our young possessed man walks, cattle fall dead at his feet which is a cool effect but not many others drop dead, just animals.  Huh?  OK, I can live with that.Rachael Weisz is the police detective whose twin sister dies jumping off a building.  I did note in these kinds of movies, glass breaking and lots of water ensue.  Quite interesting how the director uses these ploys to try to evoke mood and mythology.  At times it works, as with the green-eyed cat used by Constantine to check out Hell.  How Rachel's character's twin knows Constantine is never explained, either.Despite the insipid acting of a police detective (I mean, would you be an L.A. cop and let yourself be placed in a tub of water by a guy who lives above a bowling alley?  Yes, suspension of disbelief, but really now), the on-again-off-again Gabriel angel and the under-appreciated Shia LeBoeff, the special effects, the story and the mood went at a decent pace.  Enough to keep you interested in what happens next and the surprising but underwhelming ending.Keanu Reeves is his usual over-serious self, does a great conflicted character as he tries to buy his way into heaven despite the demerit suicide of his younger life.  Long story.My DVD had an alternate ending which was ""OK"" but still left me wanting.  The deleted scenes were thankfully deleted.  :PI'll probably pick up the Garth Ennis graphic novels first and watch this again.

The sheer laziness of director Francis Lawrence is amazing.  The editing of the film makes the story nearly incoherent.  And the script?  At one point Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) tells John Constantine (Reeves) that she fears demons have killed her (twin) sister.  Less than five minutes later she tells Constantine that she doesn't believe in the Devil!  Whoa! Doesn't someone, while filming or editing, red flag such inconsistencies?As far as the twin sister goes, that's one red herring among many - like the Spear of Destiny, insane angels, brainless ""soldier"" demons (what's the difference?), and voodoo magicians.  Much is made here of Weisz's (the ""Mummy"" lady) performance.  I don't know why.  She simply doesn't have the lines to deliver her from the mess she's in.  Reeves?  ""Constantine"" is just further evidence that he's an earlier generation's Ben Affleck.  He can't act.  And with ""Constantine,"" and its loads of special effects, he can't be insulated (this time) from that fact.  Interestingly there are two characters that do make an impression.  Tilda Swinton as gender bent angel Gabriel, who has you wondering if Gwyneth Paltrow and David Bowie have morphed into one person, and Peter Stormare's Satan.  Stormare's performance is a particular hoot.  He looks like he wandered in from the set of ""Caberet,"" and he clearly elevates things at a moment when I seemed past caring.

The movie is shot way too dark in certain scenes of the film and the special effects are tepid at the very best. Keanu Reeves gives his all but regardless of his efforts, he's not right for the role. His performance borders on way too dark to unintentionally funny plus he looks bored with what is going on. You're supposed to believe in his character but you end up just annoyed with him and that not good if you're trying to buy the story of the film. The story itself is very shaky and it makes no sense in some parts of the film. Angles and demons can't cross over into this world but yet there are half-breeds all around the city and the angle Gabriel is walking around like nothing is happing. Makes no sense but that's some of the inconstancies this movie has and it has too many of them. The only good thing of merit that the movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a complex, strong and moving performance that gives you a brief pause and makes you wonder on how this movie could have been much better off if they just centered it around her character alone, with out all the hoopla and special effects that it has now.

Besides, 'not' reading the book allowed me the oppotunity to see the movie for what it was. What 'Constantine' for me was a fun, sometimes creepy, sometimes campy film that I had a good time seeing.

Comic book based movies are now the trend and have been for quite some time.

You see he was given, or cursed, with the power to see demons, angels and things of the like.  When he was a teenager, Constantine committed suicide, which ensures his place in Hell.  However, it wasn't his time to go so now he's stuck on earth again.  Constantine now spends his better days fighting off demons who interfere with human existance and send them back to Hell.  Oh yeah, he's also dying of lung cancer. With this reputation, Constantine is feared by the inhabitants of Hell and, needless to say, hated aswell.As Constantine tries to exterminate more demons to gain passasgeway into Heaven, he because increasingly pissed off that no matter how hard he tries it just won't ever happen.  As this continues on, Constantine is drawn into the unlikely suicide of detective Angela Dodson's twin sister, Isabel.  Seeing as how there's much more to this story than just a suicide, Constantine agrees to help Angela in her quest.Now Reeves has played against the Devil before (The Devil's Advocate) and has applied some serious damage in special effect motion before (The Matrix films), but there's something about his portrayal of the angry and unwired man of solitude that that earns Reeves a head nod here. Yeah we know he can look cool in slow motion, but he puts a little something behind the his character here that gives him a little shove out of the one dimensional action character role.Everyone else is decent but none are quite as good as Reeves.  As far as the actual movie goes, there's a certain potential in the first scene with Constantine that doesn't seem to be found anywhere else.  The first scene, consisting of an exorcism, is good and even downright creepy.  After this scene, though, the movie moves in a much slower pace.  Perhaps the expectations after the first scene not being met were what caused the evident slow down.The rest of the movie is your give or take action flick.  Humorous lines and fun to watch fights/gunfights make this movie interesting.  Also, the detective angle to find out the bigger pictures also wraps the viewer in a web of curiosity that makes the movie so much more interesting.Knowing the potential the movie had brought it down some, but seeing it pass so many other comic book movies also brought it up.  Nothing spectacular here and nothing that will impact you in a deep, sensitive kind of way.  In fact, it's quite probable that Constantine will kind of drift off after its DVD release.  Either way, it still stands as an entertaining view and I give it a 7 out of 10 (or 4 stars).",4,Constantine,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,3312,"['point', 'time', 'really', 'reason', 'point', 'fingers', 'Comic', 'book', 'based', 'movies', 'are', 'now', 'trend', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'time', 'superheroes', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Spiderman', 'etc', 'grittier', 'more', 'pissed', ""'heroes"", 'Punisher', 'Spawn', 'etc', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'are', 'popping', 'up', 'bigscreen', 'everywhere.Maybe', 'was', 'because', 'maybe', 'was', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'previous', 'special', 'effect', 'box', 'office', 'smashes', 'cough', 'cough', 'Matrix', 'films', 'cough', 'cough', 'seem', 'have', 'drug', 'up', 'yet', 'gritty', 'badass', 'depths', 'underworld', 'slapped', 'bigscreen.', 'name', 'Constantine.Just', 'little', 'background', ""'hero"", 'John', 'Constantine', 'going', 'Hell', 'way', 'see', 'was', 'given', 'cursed', 'power', 'see', 'demons', 'angels', 'things', 'like', 'When', 'was', 'teenager', 'Constantine', 'committed', 'suicide', 'place', 'Hell', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'time', 'go', 'so', 'now', 'stuck', 'earth', 'again', 'Constantine', 'now', 'better', 'days', 'fighting', 'off', 'demons', 'who', 'interfere', 'human', 'existance', 'send', 'back', 'Hell', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'also', 'dying', 'lung', 'cancer', 'reputation', 'Constantine', 'feared', 'inhabitants', 'Hell', 'needless', 'say', 'hated', 'aswell.As', 'Constantine', 'tries', 'exterminate', 'more', 'demons', 'gain', 'passasgeway', 'Heaven', 'because', 'increasingly', 'pissed', 'off', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'happen', 'Constantine', 'drawn', 'unlikely', 'suicide', 'detective', 'Angela', 'Dodson', 'twin', 'sister', 'Isabel', 'Seeing', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'just', 'suicide', 'Constantine', 'help', 'Angela', 'quest.Now', 'played', 'Devil', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'applied', 'serious', 'damage', 'special', 'effect', 'motion', 'Matrix', 'films', 'something', 'portrayal', 'angry', 'unwired', 'man', 'solitude', 'head', 'nod', 'here', 'Yeah', 'know', 'can', 'look', 'cool', 'slow', 'motion', 'little', 'something', 'character', 'here', 'little', 'shove', 'one', 'dimensional', 'action', 'character', 'role.Everyone', 'else', 'decent', 'none', 'are', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Reeves', 'As', 'far', 'actual', 'movie', 'certain', 'potential', 'first', 'scene', 'Constantine', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'else', 'first', 'scene', 'consisting', 'exorcism', 'good', 'even', 'downright', 'creepy', 'scene', 'though', 'movie', 'much', 'slower', 'pace', 'Perhaps', 'expectations', 'first', 'scene', 'not', 'being', 'met', 'were', 'what', 'caused', 'evident', 'slow', 'down.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'give', 'take', 'action', 'flick', 'Humorous', 'lines', 'fun', 'watch', 'fights/gunfights', 'make', 'movie', 'interesting', 'Also', 'detective', 'angle', 'find', 'out', 'bigger', 'pictures', 'also', 'wraps', 'viewer', 'web', 'curiosity', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'interesting.Knowing', 'potential', 'movie', 'had', 'brought', 'down', 'seeing', 'pass', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'also', 'brought', 'up', 'Nothing', 'spectacular', 'here', 'nothing', 'will', 'impact', 'deep', 'sensitive', 'kind', 'way', 'fact', 'quite', 'probable', 'Constantine', 'will', 'kind', 'drift', 'DVD', 'release', 'way', 'still', 'entertaining', 'view', 'give', '7', '10', '4', 'stars']",Constantine

He has the ability to see real demons roaming the Earth & possessing the living. As the film unfolds the viewer finds out that Constantine rids the planet of these demons to buy his way into Heaven. It seems Constantine at an early age was able to see these demons that no one else can. His parents send him to the local nuthouse for a severe psych evaluation & testing (shock therapy). At the age of 15, Johnnie commits suicide & gets a glimpse of eternal damnantion in Hell. But,to his luck, John is saved & figures that if he bargains his way into Heaven, by ridding Earth of all of its demons, he may spend eternity in Heaven than in Hell (it doesn't work that way, John boy).Things change when a young woman, Angela, comes to Constantine asking for his help in the suicide/murder of her twin sister. John doesn't have much time either. Being diagnosed with severe lung cancer its time John Constantine pays the piper. Or is it?With Hell waiting for him, Heaven not wanting him, Earth needs John Constantine.The film is pretty formulaic, but decent. Keanu Reeves continues his suck-ass acting streak (I swear if he wins an Oscar, the Earth will literaly explode) as the title role coming across as a Neo/Dirty Harry smoking enough smokes to make him the new Marlboro Man.

907652,A121XO3OU9CPZ6,B0009KA7BS,"The_Opinionated_One@yahoo.com ""The Opinionate...","[0, 1]","Constantine is a movie that is suppose to make us a little bit wiser with all the spiritual logic thrown around but its the director who has a twisted logic on sprituality. It seems that the script was supposed to sound smart and supposed to make the audience understand everything that was going on but me and the others who watched this movie grasped nothing. When your pondering about whats going on storywise your hit with special effects or a battle scene or some explosion to detract from the convuluted story.The Plot-Constantine(Keanu reeves) is a tortured soul who after coming back to life from a suicide attempt when younger who now as an adult slays half-breed angels or demons who try to possess or influence people more than they should, and if they pass this barrier that is made He has to right to kill them.And in this movie Constantine develops lung cancer and feels he should go to heaven after all the demon killings he's done but is still marked for hell.(not confusing right? sure)But wait theres moreThere is an ancient sword  that has something to do with satans son being released onto earth which has to something to do with the angel gabriel when has something to do with these two twins which one commits suicide.(I know i lost you, i'm lost too.)The Action-Now this is where the movie picks up some stars.I have to say this movie does have some very good special effects which we are shown Hell, demons, heaven and very cool demon death scenes.The Battles scenes between Constantine and demons are very good and C's Arsenal is very deadly from Crucifix shaped shotguns to holy water grenade's to flamethrowers and gold plated knuckles with crucifixes engraved, cool huh?The Negatives-Well if you haven't noticed---THE STORY!!!!!!this is one story that is HARD AS HELL-pun intended- to capture and follow and all that you understand is Constantine is just one big shallow complainer.From his rants of ""I don't want to go to hell, i'm a freakin demon-slayer for christ's sake"" to ""my life sucks, i'm better off dead"" Constantine is just one big crybaby and makes for one of the worst hero's ever caught on cinema.During the last scenes of the movie i wanted Constantine to die already and just be put out of his misery already because he was making me feel miserable.In Conclusion-Good special effects, nice action scenes don't make a movie great.Maybe if this movie was released in the 80's this could have passed off as good but it's not.Confusing story, miserable lead character, weak supporting cast(even though Shia labeouf was a little amusing)and weak ending make Constantine a Weekend Rental but not a buy.Dvd bonuses include 18 minutes of additional scenes and a alternative ending(Woop-de-frickin-doo)Pros+good special effects+good action scenesCons-Dull acting-Horrible Hero-Confusing Story-weak ending2.5 stars out of 5-rounded up to 3.The Opinionated One has Spoken",3,A

His depiction as Neo Anderson in the celebrated trilogy showed more depth and ability than any other role that he had attempted in the past.  ""Constantine"" does not showcase his talents much like the ""Matrix trifecta, but manages to vividly extract every ounce of respectful acting that was once apart of him.  Reeves plays John Constantine, a cross between Same Spade and Repairman Jack from the F. Paul Wilson novels.  Constantine, a combination supernatural detective and exorcist who is on the verge of dying of lung cancer from smoking, and is a complete jerk to anyone he meets.  He deals with all kinds of supernatural occurrences all around Los Angeles. He builds a kind of reputation that is only heard in whispers and rumors and he's quite known for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) who needs his help with the mysterious suicide of her twin sister who jump off the roof of the mental hospital she was staying in. She believes that there is more to it than it seems and wants Constantine to help her figure it out.Decent yet very incoherent adaptation of the ""Hellblazer"" comic lacks that book's sense of humor and complexity and goes for the gusto in stupidity with a very poor performance by Keanu Reeves, who manages to make his last two ""Matrix"" films look like masterpieces compared to his work here. Director Francis Lawrence tries hard but lacks focus in certain scenes and lacks a sense of continually with his work. He steals from the best but lacks the substance to pull it off. The only redeeming things this movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a strong, complex and moving performance despite the fact that the movie is not worthy of it.  Overall, ""Constantine"" had a good concept, but fails with its execution. To those who want intelligence in a movie, this film certainly strained a lot of the foundation from the comic book and crammed it with religious theories and random babble. Those who want mindless action and dazzling effects, ""Constantine"" succeeds by giving them just that. But in the end, there wasn't enough action to keep that segment of the audience's attention, and the depth the film supposedly had never really showed up.",2,Constantine  (2005),1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,2617,"['Director', 'Francis', 'LawrenceCast', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Shia', 'LaBeuof', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'Max', 'Baker', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Gavin', 'Rossdale', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Peter', 'Stormare.Running', 'Time', '121', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'ghastly', 'violence', 'gore', 'language.The', 'success', 'Matrix', 'films', 'shot', 'Speed', 'Point', 'Break', 'action', 'hunk', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'stratosphere', 'stardom', 'depiction', 'Neo', 'Anderson', 'celebrated', 'trilogy', 'showed', 'more', 'depth', 'ability', 'other', 'role', 'had', 'attempted', 'past', 'Constantine', 'not', 'showcase', 'talents', 'much', 'Matrix', 'trifecta', 'vividly', 'extract', 'ounce', 'respectful', 'acting', 'was', 'once', 'apart', 'Reeves', 'John', 'Constantine', 'cross', 'Same', 'Spade', 'Repairman', 'Jack', 'F.', 'Paul', 'Wilson', 'novels', 'Constantine', 'combination', 'supernatural', 'detective', 'exorcist', 'who', 'verge', 'dying', 'lung', 'cancer', 'smoking', 'complete', 'jerk', 'anyone', 'kinds', 'supernatural', 'occurrences', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'kind', 'reputation', 'only', 'heard', 'whispers', 'rumors', 'quite', 'known', 'being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'Enter', 'Angela', 'Dodson', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'who', 'help', 'mysterious', 'suicide', 'twin', 'sister', 'who', 'jump', 'off', 'roof', 'mental', 'hospital', 'was', 'staying', 'more', 'Constantine', 'help', 'figure', 'out.Decent', 'yet', 'very', 'incoherent', 'adaptation', 'Hellblazer', 'comic', 'book', 'sense', 'humor', 'complexity', 'gusto', 'stupidity', 'very', 'poor', 'performance', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'who', 'make', 'last', 'two', 'Matrix', 'films', 'look', 'masterpieces', 'compared', 'work', 'here', 'Director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'hard', 'focus', 'certain', 'scenes', 'sense', 'continually', 'work', 'best', 'substance', 'pull', 'off', 'only', 'redeeming', 'things', 'movie', 'offer', 'performance', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'who', 'give', 'strong', 'complex', 'moving', 'performance', 'fact', 'movie', 'not', 'worthy', 'Overall', 'Constantine', 'had', 'good', 'concept', 'execution', 'who', 'want', 'intelligence', 'movie', 'film', 'certainly', 'strained', 'lot', 'foundation', 'comic', 'book', 'crammed', 'religious', 'theories', 'random', 'babble', 'who', 'want', 'mindless', 'action', 'dazzling', 'effects', 'Constantine', 'giving', 'just', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'action', 'keep', 'segment', 'audience', 'attention', 'depth', 'film', 'supposedly', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'showed', 'up']",Constantine
907655,A238M34Z3X2IBD,B0009KA7BS,Thomas E. O'Sullivan,"[3, 3]","CONSTANTINE should not work, being so divorced from its original format - the VERTIGO comic HELLBALZER, and removed so completely from the dark wit, stark horror and charm found in the original John Constantine - who is the complete opposite of a Hollywood star like Keanu Reeves.Constantine in HELLBALZER is not pretty, not sharp.  He's shapelss, lacking grace, always on the edge - but knowing where he stands, fixed between the light and the dark and the only thing keeping him in balance are his instincts, double deals and knack for killing all the right people.  And while some of this is carried over from comic to the screen - little of it makes a dent on Reeves performance (and if you want to see a near dead on perfomance of what Constantine is really like - check out James Marsters perfomance as SPIKE on both BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and ANGEL).  We all know the jokes about Reeves being wooden - and while it's true that you could almost pick up a splinter watching his performance here, it actually almost works.  But both Reeves, and the film itself, are actually hostages to style - and it's here that CONSTANTINE shines.Sterile, bleak and clean are three words you'll find yourself repeating as you watch the film.  All the edges are sharp, all the light is harsh and the darkness is brutal.  Colors are muted and often reduced to simple blacks and whites (and shades in between).  But the stand out is Hell itself.  While meant to be be horrific, the work done here is excellent (the movie gets a much needed surge in power and depth here), and you'll find yourself actually being drawn into the setting and want to know more.  It amounts in the end to nothing more than a big tease (more questions than answers), but it does really help to keep you watching the film all the way through to the credits.The story keeps to the straight and narrow.  Reeves is the star, and he's surrounded mostly by pale ghosts from the comic.  We get some names, we get some idea of their backgrounds and powers, but little is done with them.  They're there to get him from one place to another, answer a few questions, uncover the right clues at the right time and to then die off or just disappear until a sequel.  There's some attempt to build mystery and the film does try to build suspense... but can't maintain it since the Big Bad of the picture (the Son of the Devil and the Spear of Destiny) virtaully has to walk over five hundred miles before it can even remotely become a threat to Constantine or the world.  By the time it finally arrives, both we and Constantine see it coming a long way off.  But the movie does try to pull a fast one at the end with the real battle taking place between Constantine and Satan.  Peter Stormare's performance here is like a heart attack - sudden, attention grabbing and turns the world upsdie down.  There's a good reason why Reeves is already on the floor in these scenes, if he had been standing Stormare's passion for the part would have cut him off at the knees.Overall Constantine is a sharp looking picture with a lot of soft focus characters and plot.  It looks like a lot of films you've already seen (there's a strong DARK CITY vibe going on in the film), but holds enough water for it to be something worth watching.

The single disc does feature deleted scenes with optinal commentary, and while nice,(I like the original ending better - and felt that the one they used for the final film could have been blended into it easily and been that much more powerful for it) neither really add or subtract from the film.In the end, CONSTANTINE works... but only just.",3,THE BIG EMPTY,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,3858,"['CONSTANTINE', 'should', 'not', 'work', 'being', 'so', 'divorced', 'original', 'format', 'VERTIGO', 'comic', 'HELLBALZER', 'removed', 'so', 'completely', 'dark', 'wit', 'stark', 'horror', 'charm', 'found', 'original', 'John', 'Constantine', 'who', 'complete', 'opposite', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'Keanu', 'Reeves.Constantine', 'HELLBALZER', 'not', 'pretty', 'not', 'sharp', 'shapelss', 'lacking', 'grace', 'always', 'edge', 'knowing', 'where', 'fixed', 'light', 'dark', 'only', 'thing', 'keeping', 'balance', 'are', 'instincts', 'double', 'deals', 'knack', 'killing', 'right', 'people', 'carried', 'comic', 'screen', 'little', 'dent', 'Reeves', 'performance', 'want', 'see', 'near', 'dead', 'perfomance', 'what', 'Constantine', 'really', 'like', 'check', 'out', 'James', 'Marsters', 'perfomance', 'SPIKE', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'ANGEL', 'know', 'jokes', 'Reeves', 'being', 'wooden', 'true', 'could', 'almost', 'pick', 'up', 'splinter', 'watching', 'performance', 'here', 'actually', 'almost', 'works', 'Reeves', 'film', 'are', 'actually', 'hostages', 'style', 'here', 'CONSTANTINE', 'shines.Sterile', 'bleak', 'clean', 'are', 'three', 'words', ""'ll"", 'find', 'repeating', 'watch', 'film', 'edges', 'are', 'sharp', 'light', 'harsh', 'darkness', 'brutal', 'Colors', 'are', 'muted', 'often', 'reduced', 'simple', 'blacks', 'whites', 'stand', 'out', 'Hell', 'meant', 'be', 'be', 'horrific', 'work', 'done', 'here', 'excellent', 'movie', 'much', 'needed', 'surge', 'power', 'depth', 'here', ""'ll"", 'find', 'actually', 'being', 'drawn', 'setting', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'end', 'nothing', 'more', 'big', 'tease', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'really', 'help', 'keep', 'watching', 'film', 'way', 'credits.The', 'story', 'straight', 'narrow', 'Reeves', 'star', 'surrounded', 'mostly', 'pale', 'ghosts', 'comic', 'get', 'names', 'get', 'idea', 'backgrounds', 'powers', 'little', 'done', ""'re"", 'get', 'one', 'place', 'answer', 'few', 'questions', 'right', 'clues', 'right', 'time', 'then', 'die', 'off', 'just', 'disappear', 'sequel', 'attempt', 'build', 'mystery', 'film', 'try', 'build', 'suspense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'Big', 'Bad', 'picture', 'Son', 'Devil', 'Spear', 'Destiny', 'virtaully', 'walk', 'five', 'hundred', 'miles', 'can', 'even', 'remotely', 'become', 'threat', 'Constantine', 'world', 'time', 'finally', 'Constantine', 'see', 'coming', 'long', 'way', 'movie', 'try', 'pull', 'fast', 'one', 'end', 'real', 'battle', 'taking', 'place', 'Constantine', 'Satan', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'performance', 'here', 'heart', 'attack', 'sudden', 'attention', 'grabbing', 'world', 'upsdie', 'down', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'Reeves', 'already', 'floor', 'scenes', 'had', 'been', 'standing', 'Stormare', 'passion', 'part', 'would', 'have', 'cut', 'off', 'knees.Overall', 'Constantine', 'sharp', 'looking', 'picture', 'lot', 'soft', 'focus', 'characters', 'plot', 'lot', 'films', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'strong', 'DARK', 'CITY', 'vibe', 'going', 'film', 'enough', 'water', 'be', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'careful', 'viewer', 'who', 'time', 'tie', 'background', 'images', 'visual', 'clues', 'more', 'going', 'meets', 'eye.I', 'only', 'had', 'single', 'disc', 'editon', 'here', 'so', 'snazzy', 'features', 'commentary', 'are', 'lost', 'single', 'disc', 'feature', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optinal', 'commentary', 'nice', 'like', 'original', 'ending', 'better', 'felt', 'one', 'used', 'final', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'blended', 'easily', 'been', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'really', 'add', 'subtract', 'film.In', 'end', 'CONSTANTINE', 'only', 'just']",Constantine
907656,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0009KA7BS,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 2]","""Constantine"", starring Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz, is the latest big budget movie adaptation of a comic book to hit the multiplexes. Receiving almost universal bad reviews and word of mouth, the film would seem to be a surefire bomb.Perhaps because my expectation were so low, I actually thought ""Constantine"" was a good choice for a bargain matinee.John Constantine (Reeves) is working overtime. Attempting to earn a ticket into Heaven, he travels throughout Los Angeles waging a one man battle against Hell's demons. The demons are breaking through to the other side, upsetting the balance agreed upon by God and Lucifer. Angela (Weisz) runs into Constantine as they are both seeking guidance. Constantine is trying to convince the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton), that he deserves to go to Heaven. She somewhat patiently explains that he can't get in because he once committed suicide. Angela, a detective, is seeking the guidance of a priest over her twin sister's suicide at a Catholic hospital. Soon, she convinces Constantine to help her figure things out as he wages his battle with the devil.""Constantine"" has a terrific, and more importantly, consistent look. Every scene is permeated with brown tones which give it the feel of old drawings or dusty, old books from a library. This theme is carried throughout to ensure that the look of the film stays consistent. As Constantine and his driver, Chas (Shia LaBeouf, trying to channel the spirit of comic sidekicks of yesteryear) travel from one location to the next, from day to night, the film keeps us rooted in it's visual place. When the film moves the action indoors, most of the interiors are cramped and filled with millions of little objects, displaying an attention to detail that is not often shown in film today.The story of ""Constantine"" is very complex and multifaceted. Yes, his main journey is to stop Hell from breaking through, but there are a lot of facets to the story that you might not expect. Both Constantine and Angela are deeply religious, which is why they are devoting so much effort to this journey. Along the way, we learn various things about each of them, which gives them a depth you also might not expect.The performances from the supporting cast are more interesting. Pruitt Taylor Vince plays an alcoholic priest, Constantine's minder, so to speak. If a demon is trying to break through, the priest knows about it, and sends Constantine in to clean up the mess. Tilda Swinton plays the angel Gabriel. Her character plays an interesting role in the overall picture. Gavin Rossdale (lead singer of the band Bush), plays Balthazar, Constantine's main menace in the real world. His every moment is spent trying to make sure that Constantine does not win the battle or entry into Heaven. Peter Stormare plays Satan. Slightly effeminate, his role is very interesting. He seems attracted to Constantine, despite the fact that he has to do everything he can to stop him. Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz? Well, there's zero chemistry between them, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Recently, I saw Keanu Reeves interviewed on a BBC America special before the 2005 BAFTA Awards. The poor interviewer! Most of the stars were very acomodating, but not Keanu. He would barely stop. As he tried to sweep past the guy, he was asked ""How does this awards show compare to that of the Oscars?"" Keanu's response: ""It is what it is."" Well, Keanu's performance is what it always is. Keanu is always better when he doesn't have to speak a lot of lines (""Speed"", ""The Matrix""). If he doesn't have to open his mouth, we can believe most of what we are supposed to believe. If he has to act, or emote, than we run into trouble.My other big complaint is that I felt the character of Satan, as played by Peter Stormare, should have been more intelligent. He was interesting, but it seems fairly easy for Constantine to beat him. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if a human being is going to battle against the devil, it seems like it should be a fight hard won.",3,Great Visual Detail Enhances Film,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,4036,"['Constantine', 'starring', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'latest', 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'comic', 'book', 'hit', 'multiplexes', 'Receiving', 'almost', 'universal', 'bad', 'reviews', 'word', 'mouth', 'film', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'surefire', 'bomb.Perhaps', 'expectation', 'were', 'so', 'low', 'actually', 'thought', 'Constantine', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'bargain', 'matinee.John', 'Constantine', 'Reeves', 'working', 'overtime', 'Attempting', 'earn', 'ticket', 'Heaven', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'waging', 'one', 'man', 'battle', 'Hell', 'demons', 'demons', 'are', 'breaking', 'other', 'side', 'upsetting', 'balance', 'agreed', 'God', 'Lucifer', 'Angela', 'Weisz', 'Constantine', 'are', 'seeking', 'guidance', 'Constantine', 'trying', 'convince', 'angel', 'Gabriel', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'go', 'Heaven', 'somewhat', 'patiently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'once', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Angela', 'detective', 'seeking', 'guidance', 'priest', 'twin', 'sister', 'suicide', 'Catholic', 'hospital', 'Soon', 'Constantine', 'help', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'battle', 'devil', 'Constantine', 'terrific', 'more', 'importantly', 'consistent', 'look', 'scene', 'permeated', 'brown', 'tones', 'give', 'feel', 'old', 'drawings', 'dusty', 'old', 'books', 'library', 'theme', 'carried', 'ensure', 'look', 'film', 'consistent', 'Constantine', 'driver', 'Chas', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'trying', 'channel', 'spirit', 'comic', 'sidekicks', 'yesteryear', 'travel', 'one', 'location', 'next', 'day', 'night', 'film', 'rooted', 'visual', 'place', 'When', 'film', 'action', 'indoors', 'most', 'interiors', 'are', 'cramped', 'filled', 'millions', 'little', 'objects', 'displaying', 'attention', 'detail', 'not', 'often', 'shown', 'film', 'today.The', 'story', 'Constantine', 'very', 'complex', 'multifaceted', 'Yes', 'main', 'journey', 'stop', 'Hell', 'breaking', 'are', 'lot', 'facets', 'story', 'might', 'not', 'expect', 'Constantine', 'Angela', 'are', 'deeply', 'religious', 'why', 'are', 'devoting', 'so', 'much', 'effort', 'journey', 'way', 'learn', 'various', 'things', 'depth', 'also', 'might', 'not', 'expect.The', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'alcoholic', 'priest', 'Constantine', 'minder', 'so', 'speak', 'demon', 'trying', 'break', 'priest', 'Constantine', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'angel', 'Gabriel', 'character', 'interesting', 'role', 'overall', 'picture', 'Gavin', 'Rossdale', 'lead', 'singer', 'band', 'Bush', 'Balthazar', 'Constantine', 'main', 'menace', 'real', 'world', 'moment', 'spent', 'trying', 'make', 'sure', 'Constantine', 'not', 'win', 'battle', 'entry', 'Heaven', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'Satan', 'Slightly', 'effeminate', 'role', 'very', 'interesting', 'attracted', 'Constantine', 'fact', 'do', 'everything', 'can', 'stop', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Well', 'zero', 'chemistry', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Recently', 'saw', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'interviewed', 'BBC', 'America', 'special', '2005', 'BAFTA', 'Awards', 'poor', 'interviewer', 'Most', 'stars', 'were', 'very', 'acomodating', 'not', 'Keanu', 'would', 'barely', 'stop', 'tried', 'sweep', 'guy', 'was', 'asked', 'How', 'awards', 'show', 'compare', 'Oscars', 'Keanu', 'response', 'what', 'Well', 'Keanu', 'performance', 'what', 'always', 'Keanu', 'always', 'better', 'when', ""n't"", 'have', 'speak', 'lot', 'lines', 'Speed', 'Matrix', ""n't"", 'have', 'open', 'mouth', 'can', 'believe', 'most', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'act', 'emote', 'run', 'trouble.My', 'other', 'big', 'complaint', 'felt', 'character', 'Satan', 'played', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'intelligent', 'was', 'interesting', 'fairly', 'easy', 'Constantine', 'beat', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'just', 'human', 'being', 'going', 'battle', 'devil', 'should', 'be', 'fight', 'hard', 'won']",Constantine

It's especially frustrating as we just saw Frank Miller's Sin City come out not long after and stay very faithful, even down to the gritty two-color look.  I don't have a problem with Keanu Reeves but he simply was not the right guy to play a chain-smoking, run-down, sardonic Englishman that Constantine is supposed to be.  I think someone like Gary Oldman would have been a great choice to play Constantine.Keanu does the chain smoking but he looks like a guy who just started smoking yesterday, rather than the wizened, look of someone who actually HAD been chain smoking for years...add to that he does about the WORST fake coughing I've ever heard in my life.  The average ten year-old kid can fake a cough better to get out of school than Keanu does in this film.I don't mind the CGI and I think the director Francis lawrence did a pretty good job of NOT getting carried away with too many visual effects.  But how does a guy who never directed a feature film before get the reins to a film with this large a budget anyway?  While he resisted going overboard with the CGI he couldn't resist in turning what was a pure, very dark horror comic into a Van Helsing meets the Devil action flick.  There's more action in the average episode of ""This Old House"" than there is in an issue of Hellblazer.  Hellblazer is NOT an action hero...he's not a hero period.  Not even a good guy really and ultimately that's what Lawrence had him become...a pretty boy demon hunter.I won't delve too much into the script although I'd love to know why the Spear of Destiny was buried in the Mexican desert.  The film does have a pretty good supporting cast with Rachel Weisz as the cop/psychic object of the devil's search, and Peter Stromare as the devil himself in yet another oddball role he seems born to play.With all that said I'm still going to give it a slightly positive review.  I thought the story was pretty well-written although I think the plot was perhaps a bit too grand.  The affects were good, particularly those scenes in the wind-blasted desolation of hell.

Constantine is yet another movie derived from a comic book series I haven't read, but frankly, I don't get the feeling I missed that much.The writer and director have managed to almost completely recreates the Matrix plot in this new context (substitue demons for Rogue programmes and the real world / hell divide for the real world / matrix divide), which you might have thought would make it an easier adjustment for Reeves but he still fails to act, turning in yet another stirling performance as himself, which worked sort of OK-ish in the Matrix, but by now has become a little tired.Rachel Weisz plays Keanu's love interest, who is roped into Reeves' anti-demon war when her twin sister (who has been committed to a mental institution because she sees demons) kills herself and (as a good catholic) is cast into hell.Whilst some have raved about Rachel Weisz's performance here I can't help feeling its more because she's gorgeous than as a result of her acting talent. Even if her acting was of oscar winning quality, there's not much she can do about the script (her character's actions are utterly unbelieveable even within the scope of the ridiculous plot).Having said all that, I was entertained (and there are some good bits at the end where Satan appears as a snorting man in a white suit).",3,matrix style special effects fest,1122508800,"07 28, 2005",2005,1505,"['Reeves', 'denial', 'end', 'Matrix', 'franchise.Here', 'Reeves', 'unfortunate', 'exorcist', 'wandering', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'banishing', 'misbehaving', 'half', 'breed', 'demons', 'back', 'hell', 'Constantine', 'yet', 'movie', 'derived', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'feeling', 'missed', 'much.The', 'writer', 'director', 'have', 'managed', 'almost', 'completely', 'Matrix', 'plot', 'new', 'context', 'substitue', 'demons', 'Rogue', 'programmes', 'real', 'world', '/', 'hell', 'divide', 'real', 'world', '/', 'matrix', 'divide', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'make', 'easier', 'adjustment', 'Reeves', 'still', 'act', 'turning', 'yet', 'stirling', 'performance', 'worked', 'sort', 'OK-ish', 'Matrix', 'now', 'become', 'little', 'tired.Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Keanu', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'roped', 'Reeves', 'anti-demon', 'war', 'when', 'twin', 'sister', 'who', 'been', 'committed', 'mental', 'institution', 'demons', 'good', 'catholic', 'cast', 'hell.Whilst', 'have', 'raved', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'performance', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'more', 'gorgeous', 'result', 'acting', 'talent', 'Even', 'acting', 'was', 'oscar', 'winning', 'quality', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'script', 'character', 'actions', 'are', 'utterly', 'unbelieveable', 'even', 'scope', 'ridiculous', 'plot', '.Having', 'said', 'was', 'entertained', 'are', 'good', 'bits', 'end', 'where', 'Satan', 'snorting', 'man', 'white', 'suit']",Constantine

True, the story as it was orignally written deserves most of the credit.  But, the acting in this film (even the much lamented Keanu Reeves) is believable and suited well for this movie.  I do wish there had been more types of demons enountered (along with the various ways to vanquish them - similar to the opening scene), but one must review what is on the screen, not what isn't.  Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed this one - nothing was overdone (which is easy to do in this type of genre) - even the appearances of Gabriel, Balthazar, and Lucifer are convincingly presented, without being campy or cliched.  I ended up buying this one to watch again... definately recommended.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

907667,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0009KA7BS,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 10]","So what's wrong with 'Constantine'?  Contrary to my low expectations, it turned out not unentertaining film.  You get solid production designs, you get moody photography by Philippe Rousselot ('River Runs Through it'), and you get an interesting story (at least, it looked so at the beginning).  The opening ten minutes are very good even though it looks as if the ideas are borrowed from that Linda Blair film.  I don't know whether or nor Keanu Reeves can really act, but you still get Rachel Weisz and Tilda Swinton.  So why people, I mean some people, hate it?[WEAK SCRIPT] That's it, if you don't like Hollywood movies, 90 per cent of the reasons is this.  The film, based on graphic novels I don't know, is about John Constantine played by Keanu Reeves, a dismal-looking, chain-smoking, way-too-cynical guy who distrusts people in general.  And he doesn't care if his harsh words hurt the cop Angela (Weisz) whose twin sister has just been found dead.However, we have to believe that it is John Constantine who saves the world from the satanic powers (like 'The Matrix'), and that Angela holds the key to doing this job (like you know what).  To make this ambitious premises work, the screenwriters should have created much more convincing characters than the present ones.  Instead the film largely relies on the cliched ideas -- costly CGIs, gadgets provided by a 'M'-like scientist, and very basic (and misleading) concepts about heaven and hell, or the Catholic Church.[Why?  IT'S TILDA SWINTON HERE!] It is not the actors who cannot act that really look awful among the lackluster movie; it is the actors who can act that suffer from the generic dialogues.  So, it is Tilda Swinton who should have known better than playing Gabriel in ... er ... very unique costumes.  The filmmaker must have decided on casting her after seeing her 'Orlando.'  But 'Orlando' didn't require her to sport a pair of CGI-created wings on her shoulders, which add unexpected campiness to the film.  Rachel Weisz is slightly better -- her role Angela is a much more complex role -- but for all her strong acting as Angela tormented by her sister's death, it is painfully clear that she has not found a right role in Hollywood yet.  And Keanu Reeves?  All I can say is that he shouldn't have used his middle finger to show the character's anger.  If sticking up his finger is the best he can do to be in character, and it's done to Peter Stormare clad in white suit, what can I say?But like I said, he tries to save the day, and we are supposed to see things from his viewpoint.  He has a special power to see things, things in hell in particular; he can fight a bunch of nasty half-devils, and he can introduce us to many visually stunning scenes helped by modern special effects.

907668,ANN4JW1E08AS6,B0009KA7BS,tuberacer,"[3, 4]","Sorry, I don't get all the bad reviews here about this film. ""Camp-fest?"" No, not really. Not at all. Maybe that's someone's wishful thinking?  ""Juvenile lesson in pseudo-Catholic salvation?"" Huh? Methinks perhaps the movie hit too close to someone's bone? It's an action thriller, and a very good one. Even the bad reviews about Keanu Reaves don't make much sense to me. Yeah, it's Neo again, and thank God, he's not doing any Kung Fu this time. Those Matrix movies deteriorated from the first one into the most dismal action films of all time. I rate the third one as perhaps the worst movie of all time, so it was fine with me if the original Neo cool is resurrected out of that ashheap in a fresh new universe devoid of all that spinning-off-the-walls kick boxing. So what if it's deadpan Keanu? It works. This character is a man who understands that life and the emotions are ephemera and are to be experienced mostly for their desperate opportunity, and that redemption in the end is a very iffy proposition, so yeah, he's not flexing the emotional muscle a lot-it's not on his mind. When the movie was almost over, it suddenly occurred to me that no kiss had taken place. Wow, what a fantastic accomplishment that was and how great that Keanu didn't insist on one being written into the script! That alone says something to me about Keanu as an actor. Do you think any of the other major male star's agents would have let a pucker on Rachel's thick blooms slip away? No gratuitous romance! Thank you! I get enough of that everywhere else.On second thought, maybe I do understand the negative reactions and confusions of other viewers. You have to have some knowledge of the mythology that the Bible was initially built upon to understand the events in this movie--although of course, that mythology has been transposed in this movie--sometimes ridiculously as per the genre--into a comic book situation with a comic book main character. In this day when, for good or for bad, most young Americans probably know more about the traditions and details of Star Trek than the details of the so-called great books of their culture, it should probably be no surprise that the clues to meaning in this film are completely unfathomed by perhaps the majority of its viewers. Many of the Judeo-Christian references are probably no more comprehensible to many, if not most viewers, than if the details were based upon the Indian Mahabharata.I found the film intriguing--a really fascinating play with the Judeo-Christian mythology. I've not read the comics, nor even seen them. Why would I need to? This is a tight script. The universe of fallen angels and a uniquely redeemed mankind in a rigorously ruled chess match where some are trying to cheat. This is pure Book of Genesis undertext with Miltonian coloring. This is the universe that bred mainstream American Christian culture. Like I say, you need to be Biblically literate to understand it. The Book of Job would be a good place to start, and Genesis, of course. You might even start with Milton's ""Paradise Lost."" It's all part of the Genesis ""myth"" as it has evolved to today. And then, there are a few details which come out of the ""popular"" mythology rather that the great book itself.Being familiar with the mythology, I found nothing confusing about this plot, and no wasted imagery.  The special effects are spectacular. The direction is fine, and some of the acting absolutely superb. Tilda Swinton was a crisp delight as Gabriel (oh those wings!) and Rachel Weisz, yes, she was great as everyone says, but Peter Stormare's Satan was pure genius. People who think this film poorly directed should really study that Satan scene. That was a difficult character and very difficult scene to pull off successfully without flopping back on the stupid old overblown stereotype and required extreme precision by both actor and director to keep it original and as intense as it needed to be. Had a great, unexpected laugh in that scene too. Maybe Keanu's not the best of actors. I don't know, and wouldn't care.  Maybe he's the Gary Cooper of our day. Keanu carried me through this film from beginning to end and I enjoyed the whole trip, so he did a great job as far as I'm concerned. I was captivated by this fresh fleshing out of the Genesis-Revelations myth, much the same as, say, I enjoy the fleshing out of the vampire myths by Anne Rice. It gave it a tactile, up to date reality. A mix of ""The Matrix,"" ""What Dreams May Come,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" and ""The Omen."" Terrific.

907670,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0009KA7BS,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[3, 3]","CONSTANTINE follows one story of many in the life of John Constantine (played by Keanu Reeves), an addicted smoker who once tried to took committed suicide as a boy, but was miraculously brought back to life. Since that time he has been able to see the spiritual world manifested in our world wherever he goes. He sees both the forces of good & evil for what they are. However, since he committed the mortal sin of suicide, Constantine is not allowed to enter Heaven. Trying to pay his way to salvation through works, Constantine sets forth on a battle against the demons & other forces of evil to save and rescue as many souls from the clutches of Hell as possible. Along the way, he sends as many half-breed demons as he can back to Hell. Constantine has become so good at doing what he does that they say his is one of only a handful of souls that Satan himself will come to collect when he dies.Anyway, towards the beginning of the movie Constantine performs an exorcism in which a full-fledged warrior demon was attempted to cross over from the spiritual world into our world. This isn't supposed to happen and signals a shift in the balance between good & evil. Constantine knows something big is happening, but he just doesn't know what. It takes him a couple trips to Hell and back and meeting up with a psychic cop to piece the puzzle together and then it's up to Constantine and company to save the world before all Hell breaks loose.CONSTANTINE is based upon the Hellblazer comics and since I've never read the books I cannot at this time comment on the accuracy between the books and the movie. What I can say is that despite the criticism Reeves constantly gets, he does a good job in this movie. For years he has been haunted by the BILL & TED persona, but thanks to a large part to the Matrix, Reeves has come into his own. It is possible that he might now be typecast as a sort of everyman-superhero/action figure, but he fits those roles perfectly.The special effects in the film are pretty amazing, especially the visits to Hell.

907674,A38TC59GM2WW1X,B0009KA7BS,"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts""","[3, 4]","I am consistently exasperated by reviewers who go to movies like ""Constantine"" expecting it to deliver oscar-level plot and material, then criticisng it because it does not.  These movies are ""fun"", popcorn-munching movies designed to entertain; if you don't expect them to be something they're not designed to be, you'll enjoy yourself.That said, ""Constantine"" actually exceeded my expectations a litle.  I found the suspense and action to be fairly taut and well-paced.  Throughout the film I was entertained and on edge, wondering what would happen next.  It's primarily an action/""scifi"" (I use the term loosely, of course) film, with just enough references to Christian daemonology/mythology to give it a little bit of edge and depth, like how a dash of pepper really kicks a particular dish up a notch.  I enjoyed the references to the Spear of Destiny (which reputedly pierced Jesus Christ on the cross), and to various personalities of Christian daemonology (Balthazar, Mammon).  The occult aspect also adds much to the dark, brooding aspect of the film.However, the movie of course is not a traditional, dark, ""Priest-vs.-Satan"" movie; Reeves is great as the flawed hero with a wonderfully sardonic sense of humour.  I am so tired of people always bagging on Reeves, claiming he's a bad, wooden actor.  I beg to differ.  In fact, I think in this movie his personality really shines through, and he does a great job portraying the complexity of his character.  Constantine is a mix of tragedy, cynicism, self-pity, and yet also hope.  He's an ""everyman"" in which the contrasts have been magnified, viz. the good is better, and the bad is worse, but all in all I see plenty of myself in him.The always delectable Rachel Weisz as ""Angela"" not only adds female eye-candy to the ensemble, but also does a great job being the person who's the ""outsider"" to the paranormal and occult, and thus acts as an anchor for the audience to identify with.  Yet like Constantine, her character is also tinged with a bit of darkness, only in her case without the sardonic humour, so it's actually a bit creepy.  I love the sexual/romantic tension between Angela and Constantine.  It's unusually well-handled for a film of this sort.  I'm glad they didn't kiss in the end, it only strengthens the tension and adds some delicious ambiguity to their relationship.Lastly I'd like to make a quick mention of how much I loved the character of Gabriel, the fallen angel played by Tilda Swinton.  Swinton, with her big eyes, just has this unique, unusual, other-wordly kind of beauty that draws you in and yet makes you uncomfortable at the same time.  She's utterly perfect for her role, which although small, was unforgettable for me.  And there's something inexplicably sexy about Swinton as Gabriel.  Maybe it's the gender-bending touch of masculinity in her dress and behaviour, or that suave, all-knowing look swirled together with that of a confused, crazy child.  She's just....just go watch her.",4,Entertaining and delightful; 4.5 stars,1108857600,"02 20, 2005",2005,2987,"['am', 'consistently', 'exasperated', 'reviewers', 'who', 'go', 'movies', 'Constantine', 'expecting', 'deliver', 'oscar-level', 'plot', 'material', 'then', 'criticisng', 'not', 'movies', 'are', 'fun', 'popcorn-munching', 'movies', 'designed', 'entertain', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'something', ""'re"", 'not', 'designed', 'be', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'yourself.That', 'said', 'Constantine', 'actually', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'litle', 'found', 'suspense', 'action', 'be', 'fairly', 'taut', 'well-paced', 'film', 'was', 'entertained', 'edge', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'primarily', 'action/', 'scifi', 'use', 'term', 'loosely', 'course', 'film', 'just', 'enough', 'references', 'Christian', 'daemonology/mythology', 'give', 'little', 'bit', 'edge', 'depth', 'how', 'dash', 'pepper', 'really', 'particular', 'dish', 'up', 'notch', 'enjoyed', 'references', 'Spear', 'Destiny', 'reputedly', 'pierced', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'cross', 'various', 'personalities', 'Christian', 'daemonology', 'Balthazar', 'Mammon', 'occult', 'aspect', 'also', 'much', 'dark', 'brooding', 'aspect', 'film.However', 'movie', 'course', 'not', 'traditional', 'dark', 'Priest-vs.-Satan', 'movie', 'Reeves', 'great', 'flawed', 'hero', 'wonderfully', 'sardonic', 'sense', 'humour', 'am', 'so', 'tired', 'people', 'always', 'bagging', 'Reeves', 'claiming', 'bad', 'wooden', 'actor', 'beg', 'differ', 'fact', 'think', 'movie', 'personality', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'complexity', 'character', 'Constantine', 'mix', 'tragedy', 'cynicism', 'self-pity', 'yet', 'also', 'hope', 'everyman', 'contrasts', 'have', 'been', 'magnified', 'viz', 'good', 'better', 'bad', 'worse', 'see', 'plenty', 'him.The', 'always', 'delectable', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Angela', 'not', 'only', 'female', 'eye-candy', 'ensemble', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'person', 'who', 'outsider', 'paranormal', 'occult', 'thus', 'acts', 'anchor', 'audience', 'identify', 'Constantine', 'character', 'also', 'tinged', 'bit', 'darkness', 'only', 'case', 'sardonic', 'humour', 'actually', 'bit', 'creepy', 'love', 'sexual/romantic', 'tension', 'Angela', 'Constantine', 'unusually', 'well-handled', 'film', 'sort', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'kiss', 'end', 'only', 'tension', 'delicious', 'ambiguity', 'relationship.Lastly', ""'d"", 'like', 'make', 'quick', 'mention', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'character', 'Gabriel', 'fallen', 'played', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Swinton', 'big', 'eyes', 'just', 'unique', 'unusual', 'other-wordly', 'kind', 'beauty', 'yet', 'uncomfortable', 'same', 'time', 'utterly', 'perfect', 'role', 'small', 'was', 'unforgettable', 'something', 'inexplicably', 'about', 'Swinton', 'Gabriel', 'Maybe', 'gender-bending', 'touch', 'masculinity', 'dress', 'behaviour', 'suave', 'all-knowing', 'look', 'swirled', 'together', 'confused', 'crazy', 'child', 'just', '.just', 'go']",Constantine

Constantine is damned for something mysterious in his past and he's trying to work it off hoping to buy his way into Heaven. God, though, isn't buying. When Constatine realizes that demons are not possessing humans but are trying to cross over he reluctantly teams with police detective Rachel Weisz in trying to discover who was behind the death of her sister. The two meet when Weisz seeks an audience with a priest who happens to be meeting with the Earthly form of the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton).Aimed at audiences with a combination of elements from ""The Exorcist"" and action adventure movies inspired by comic books, ""Constantine"" may not be true to its source (the comic book ""Hellblazer"") but the powerful visual effects combined with strong performances makes this film worthwhile. While I had my doubts about Reeves pulling off the role of Constantine, he proved to be outstanding in the role. Unlike, say, Neo from ""The Matrix"", Constantine comes across as a selfish, rude loner interested in using his gift to see the demons that walk around uninvited in our world but not totally accepting responsibility for the consquences of his action. Weisz pulls off her role as Detective Angela Dodson with just the right mix of street smarts and disbelief at what she sees when in the company of Constantine. Gavin Rossdale comes across as a bit of a cypher as Balthazar an Earthbound half breed demon working who is Constantine's opposite in this battle for humanity.While first time film director Francis Lawrence puts together fascinating images, he occasionally loses control of the narrative causing audiences to play catch up with the story. That's OK, thouh, as it keeps the audience from guessing every twist and turn of this unusual film. The screenplay by Kevin Brodbin(the fascinating but unseen thriller ""Mindhunters"") and Frank Cappello (cult classic ""No Way Back"") borrows enough from the source material to keep this original tale interesting for fans of the comic book source and those unfamiliar with it. Many fans of the comic will, no doubt, be upset with the liberties taken with the material but I'd sugget keeping an open mind and viewing this as you would any film taken from another source.The visually stunning sequences set in Hell along with those portraying Heaven with impressive CGI effects make this a memorable film. Although it isn't perfect, the film provides a solid two hours of entertainment with a number of fascinating ideas and questions raised about this world and the next. Exceptionally good supernatural thriller although it may be too visually dense to attract the audience it needs to succeed.",4,"""The horror, the horror""",1108857600,"02 20, 2005",2005,2812,"['Fighting', 'Hell', 'Earth', 'John', 'Constantine', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'demons', 'day', 'trying', 'keep', 'balance', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'City', 'Angels', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Constantine', 'damned', 'something', 'mysterious', 'past', 'trying', 'work', 'off', 'hoping', 'buy', 'way', 'Heaven', 'God', 'though', ""n't"", 'buying', 'When', 'Constatine', 'demons', 'are', 'not', 'possessing', 'humans', 'are', 'trying', 'cross', 'reluctantly', 'police', 'detective', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'trying', 'discover', 'who', 'was', 'death', 'sister', 'two', 'meet', 'when', 'Weisz', 'audience', 'priest', 'who', 'be', 'meeting', 'Earthly', 'form', 'angel', 'Gabriel', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', '.Aimed', 'audiences', 'combination', 'elements', 'Exorcist', 'action', 'adventure', 'movies', 'inspired', 'comic', 'books', 'Constantine', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'source', 'comic', 'book', 'Hellblazer', 'powerful', 'visual', 'effects', 'combined', 'strong', 'performances', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'had', 'doubts', 'Reeves', 'pulling', 'off', 'role', 'Constantine', 'proved', 'be', 'outstanding', 'role', 'say', 'Neo', 'Matrix', 'Constantine', 'across', 'selfish', 'rude', 'loner', 'interested', 'using', 'gift', 'see', 'demons', 'walk', 'around', 'uninvited', 'world', 'not', 'totally', 'accepting', 'responsibility', 'consquences', 'action', 'Weisz', 'role', 'Detective', 'Angela', 'Dodson', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'street', 'smarts', 'disbelief', 'what', 'when', 'company', 'Constantine', 'Gavin', 'Rossdale', 'across', 'bit', 'cypher', 'Balthazar', 'Earthbound', 'half', 'breed', 'demon', 'working', 'who', 'Constantine', 'opposite', 'battle', 'humanity.While', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'together', 'fascinating', 'images', 'occasionally', 'control', 'narrative', 'causing', 'audiences', 'play', 'catch', 'up', 'story', 'OK', 'thouh', 'audience', 'guessing', 'twist', 'turn', 'unusual', 'film', 'screenplay', 'Kevin', 'Brodbin', 'fascinating', 'unseen', 'thriller', 'Mindhunters', 'Frank', 'Cappello', 'cult', 'classic', 'Way', 'Back', 'enough', 'source', 'material', 'keep', 'original', 'tale', 'interesting', 'fans', 'comic', 'book', 'source', 'unfamiliar', 'Many', 'fans', 'comic', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'upset', 'liberties', 'taken', 'material', ""'d"", 'sugget', 'keeping', 'open', 'mind', 'viewing', 'would', 'film', 'taken', 'source.The', 'visually', 'stunning', 'sequences', 'set', 'Hell', 'portraying', 'Heaven', 'impressive', 'CGI', 'effects', 'make', 'memorable', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'film', 'solid', 'two', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'number', 'fascinating', 'ideas', 'questions', 'raised', 'world', 'next', 'Exceptionally', 'good', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'visually', 'dense', 'attract', 'audience', 'succeed']",Constantine

It's obvious that Keanu Reeves needed a commercial hit again since the completion of The Matrix series, but he's not right for this gig. He's too good looking in this movie, and if he had done some serious transformation like Christian Bale(The Machinist), he probably would be more convincing. Oh well, he's definitely got 5 times more fans and bankability than Bale, even if he's a less sophisticated actor.This film didn't strike me as horror experience, it's more of a religion/spiritual thriller. In the beginning, we get to see Reeves perform an exorcism on a girl who was posessed by a demon that escaped Hell, and it was his ""job"" to capture and deport it back to The Other Dimension. It was an impressive visual, even if the girl was not Linda Blair. From that moment on, the film headed on a multi-plot direction that was kind of confusing. As for the structure of Hell and how someone will be rejected by Heaven(also known as The Other Side), it's not very acurate. Reeve's character is someone who attempted suicide at an early age, because he couldn't take it anymore dued to his overwhelming ability(gift) to see through other dimensions. He came back, and he's not eligible to go to Heaven, but he intended to regain credibility by fighting against Hell. During his journey, he encounters Rachel Weisz(playing a dual role of twins), whose sister committed suicide and she was trying to unsolve her mysterious death, since she knew that she didn't deliberately killed herself. Reeves was the only person to assist her to dig into the surface of things. Along the way, there are other characters they come across, including Reeves' sidekick(a psychic). A mysterious Archangel played by the underused Tilda Swinton who managed to steal scenes with every minute of the screen time. A Witch Doctor who had the access to both Heaven and Hell played by the very intense  Djimon Hounsou, he was so good that Keanu Reeves looked like a supporting role when they are in a scene together. Throughout the rest of this movie, Reeves and Weisz were attacked by demons and and he had to decent to Hell to investigate things, but we don't really get to know who the real mastermind of the plot to take ove the world is until the very end.The story was kind of weak, but it's got some good visuals consistently. Keanu Reeves didn't get to do very much action scenes like he did in The Matrix.

Despite that last point, it's an exciting bit of entertainment.Chain-smoking John Constantine sees demons everywhere, real demons. That sets him up with a great job as hired-gun exorcist, which gets him into and out of lots of interesting scrapes. He sees the angel Gabriel, and sees Hell as well. It's an up to date story in the heaven/hell/demons tradition. For me, it works well as an action story even though the pseudo-Catholic mythology doesn't.Reeves is Reeves, with his usual angst-laden running around and monotone voice. The pleasant surprise was Tilda Swinton as Gabriel. The role is vaguely androgynous, a good match for the gender-bending in Swinton's earlier ""Orlando."" She did a good job with her few appearances, and generally rose above the ordinary script she was given.If you like the demons-on-earth genre, you might find good entertainment here.

The story begins with the finding of the ""Sword of Destiny"" - the sword that was used to spear Jesus Christ on the Cross at Calvary - and ends with John Constantine battled none other than Lucifer himself.Constantine moves along at a good pace and provides an immersive story that will keep you engrossed. There are grand battles with flying demons, and a good working chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Rachal Weisz. Overall, you will walk away from Constantine having been entertained as well as glad you stepped into the fictional world of the ""Hellblazer.""There are some weak spots to the film. Keanu Reeves was generally very convining, but had moments (especially when he was smoking cigarettes) where he seemed a little off. There were also some blatant inconsistancies that can leave the audience scratching their collective heads. For example: in the first 45 minutes of Constantine, John Constantine is continuously smoking cigarettes, and we are shown (quite often) the severity of his lung cancer. Then, for seemingly no reason, this character issue is forgotten. There is no hint of cigarettes or lung cancer until one of the last scenes.Despite these odd defects, Constantine is worth viewing.Total Score (out of 100) = 7138 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

You also get to see a scene where their was supposed sex with the girl with the tail.

Even though he is conceited and knows where he will be going he still finds time to do some good for mankind and in the process send a few demons back where they came from.Something has gone horribly wrong with the balance.

907685,A3I92PEEL1B62O,B0009KA7BS,"wysewomon ""wysewomon""","[3, 4]","I've been reading _Hellblazer_ since the beginning.  In fact, I've been a fan of John Constantine since Alan Moore created him in _Swamp Thing._  So I viewed the prospect of a Hellblazer movie with trepidation.  The more I heard about it, the more disgusted I got with the Hollywoodization of one of my favourite characters.  I didn't see the movie in the theatre, but I rented the DVD on the first day it came out--because I knew I'd do it sometime and wanted to get it over with.  And you know, this movie isn't nearly as bad as it could have been.John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) was born with the power to see beyond this mortal coil (something that's never really explained in the book, so here they make something up).  He lives his life as a kind of roving, last-chance exorcist, getting rid of otherworldly nasties that have broken the rules that allow them to manifest on this plane.  He has his allies--a priest who hears voices and a nerdy supply agent (kind of a metaphysical ""Q""), but mostly he's a loner.  Unfortunately for him, he's diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in the beginning of the movie (this idea is losely based on Garth Ennis' ""Dangerous Habits"" storyline).  But something big is coming and he hopes that getting involved in whatever it is will end up in his spending eternity in Heaven, rather than the other place (to which it seems sure he's bound).Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) is a police detective with a psychic punch of her own. Her sister has recently met her end in an apparent suicide.  Because they're devout Catholics, to whom suicide is a mortal sin, Angela is invested in believing Isabel didn't actually take her own life.  Trying to prove it leads her to Constantine.  As an unlikely team, they try to figure out what's making the boundaries between Earth and Hell so thin and to stop it before it's too late._Hellblazer_ fans watching this movie should do what I did:  repeat to yourself, ""It's not MY John Constantine;  it's another bloke with the same name.""  This should help you get past the obvious problems with the character (like he's a dark-haired American instead of a blond Englishman--at least they axed the ""Constantine-mobile"") and allow you to enjoy what's enjoyable about the flick.  And there is quite a bit to enjoy.  The plot is pretty good;  in fact, it makes a fair stab at being many-layered.  As in many metaphysical horror type flicks, a large suspension of disbelief is required.  You just gotta accept that such-and-such an artifact calls up demons because some guy says so.  _Constantine_ the movie didn't exactly make this easy.  There was a lot of over-the-top stuff going on that didn't adhere to any internal logic.  But  if the pill was hard to swallow, at least swallowing was possible.The performances were also pretty good.  Keanu Reeves was pretty much Keanu Reeves (and as such, never my first choice for J.C.;  I would have liked to have seen James Marsters or whasisname from ""Trainspotting."")  But his standard character fit into the script well enough.  Rachel Weisz was also in a fairly standard lady-cop role.  It was the minor characters who really hooked me.  Tilda Swinton as Gabriel was an interesting casting choice, trying for the androgyny of angels (but not quite making it;  Swinton's voice was too high-pitched).  Lucifer, Papa Midnite and John's several sidemen also turned in good work.  The only one I didn't like was Chas, whose role had devolved into a wisecracking boy-hostage type.What I didn't like about this movie was pretty much what I had expected:  _Hellblazer_, though chock full of various dismemberments and disfigurements, is essentially a book of psychological horror.  John Constantine is not an action hero.  Therefore, Hollywood's insistence on making him one--complete with a dragon breath flamethrower for demon fighting (please!)--did not sit well with me.  So the movie had a jerky feel as it battled between having a coherent and interesting plot and simply blowing up zombies._Constantine's_ main fault is that it tries to do too many things at once.  There's too much melodrama and silly widgets for people looking for a thinking thriller.  For those to whom blowing up zombies is reason enough, there's too much plot getting in the way.  As a movie, it tries to straddle a line between genres and ends up shaking a lot.  Still, there were satisying moments I would consider renting it worth the money.Just remember, It's not the real John Constantine.
