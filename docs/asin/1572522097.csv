They speak very little about Gummo, or why Zeppo left the act after Duck Soup.  There seems to be an imbalanced amount of focus on the ""You Bet Your Life"" period for Groucho.There is some very interesting scenes of early test shots of one of their Broadway plays that was never made to film, as well as test shooting for a television show that was never made. Also, there are some fascinating facts about their lives; but as documentaries go this one is poorly edited and incomplete.",2,Dissapointing,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,577,"['Very', 'little', 'documentary', 'focus', 'years', 'started', 'making', 'films', 'speak', 'very', 'little', 'Gummo', 'why', 'Zeppo', 'left', 'act', 'Duck', 'Soup', 'be', 'imbalanced', 'amount', 'focus', 'Bet', 'Life', 'period', 'Groucho.There', 'very', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'early', 'test', 'shots', 'one', 'Broadway', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'test', 'shooting', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'Also', 'are', 'fascinating', 'facts', 'lives', 'documentaries', 'go', 'one', 'poorly', 'edited', 'incomplete']",N/A
186304,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,1572522097,Andrew McCaffrey,"[53, 53]","As a biography of the Marx Brothers, the documentary does a competent if not excellent job. There are numerous interviews with their few surviving friends and various Marx offspring. But if you're looking for an in-depth, detailed portrait of how they lived their lives, then I would recommend reading one of the numerous books that have been published on the subject (Harpo's autobiography HARPO SPEAKS! is particularly worthy, especially on their childhood and pre-movie period).That said, where this program shines is when it displays various pieces of scratchy old footage. Whether it was seeing Harpo's first role in a recently discovered silent movie, or an elderly Groucho trading barbs with Bill Cosby, the clips here are gems. Included here is material shot for the aborted Marx Brothers 50's TV series which (if not for Chico's deteriorating health) would have featured Groucho, Harpo, and Chico as guardian angels (the theological implications of this are astounding). There are also a few of the commercials that Harpo did for Labatt's Beer. As his son points out in one of the interviews, they're the most surreal advertisements you're likely to see. The bulk of this footage (and the documentary itself) consists of their public and television appearances after their movie careers had ended.The DVD also contains a few outtakes from Groucho's YOU BET YOUR LIFE television show. Relatively tame by today's standards (a sample, which was too raunchy for those early days of television: ""You met your wife in the dark-room? Was she well developed?""), but funny all the same. Groucho's quick wit gets him into trouble with the overbearing censors of the era, and as a disapproving contestant on You Bet Your Life tells him, ""That's going to be censored, Groucho."" The despondent reply: ""I know.""This isn't the place to go if you want to spend a couple of hours convulsed with laughter. But it is a wonderful, if light, look at the career of the Marx Brothers. The production of the documentary has a slightly cheap feel to it, and Leslie Neilson's narration is a little flat. But while it can't compete with the volumes of books written on the subject, it does do one thing that the prose can't -- show us the Brothers in action. And with material that you're not likely to have seen anywhere else, this is invaluable for any fan of the Marx Brothers.",4,Hooray For Captain Spaulding!,1044921600,"02 11, 2003",2003,2362,"['biography', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'documentary', 'competent', 'not', 'excellent', 'job', 'are', 'numerous', 'interviews', 'few', 'surviving', 'friends', 'various', 'Marx', 'offspring', ""'re"", 'looking', 'in-depth', 'detailed', 'portrait', 'how', 'lived', 'lives', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'reading', 'one', 'numerous', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'published', 'subject', 'Harpo', 'autobiography', 'HARPO', 'SPEAKS', 'particularly', 'worthy', 'especially', 'childhood', 'pre-movie', 'period', 'said', 'where', 'program', 'shines', 'when', 'various', 'pieces', 'scratchy', 'old', 'footage', 'was', 'seeing', 'Harpo', 'first', 'role', 'recently', 'discovered', 'silent', 'movie', 'elderly', 'Groucho', 'trading', 'barbs', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'clips', 'here', 'are', 'gems', 'Included', 'here', 'material', 'shot', 'aborted', 'Marx', 'Brothers', '50', 'TV', 'series', 'not', 'Chico', 'deteriorating', 'health', 'would', 'have', 'featured', 'Groucho', 'Harpo', 'Chico', 'guardian', 'angels', 'theological', 'implications', 'are', 'astounding', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'commercials', 'Harpo', 'did', 'Labatt', 'Beer', 'son', 'points', 'out', 'one', 'interviews', ""'re"", 'most', 'surreal', 'advertisements', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see', 'bulk', 'footage', 'documentary', 'public', 'television', 'appearances', 'movie', 'careers', 'had', 'ended.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'few', 'outtakes', 'Groucho', 'YOU', 'BET', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'television', 'show', 'Relatively', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'sample', 'was', 'too', 'raunchy', 'early', 'days', 'television', 'met', 'wife', 'dark-room', 'Was', 'well', 'developed', 'funny', 'same', 'Groucho', 'quick', 'wit', 'trouble', 'overbearing', 'censors', 'era', 'disapproving', 'contestant', 'Bet', 'Life', 'going', 'be', 'censored', 'Groucho', 'despondent', 'reply', 'know', ""n't"", 'place', 'go', 'want', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'convulsed', 'laughter', 'wonderful', 'light', 'look', 'career', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'production', 'documentary', 'slightly', 'cheap', 'feel', 'Leslie', 'Neilson', 'narration', 'little', 'flat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'volumes', 'books', 'written', 'subject', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'prose', 'ca', ""n't"", 'show', 'Brothers', 'action', 'material', ""'re"", 'not', 'likely', 'have', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'else', 'invaluable', 'fan', 'Marx', 'Brothers']",N/A

186310,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,1572522097,Phil S.,"[9, 9]","For longtime fans this is absolutely essential, especially for those of us who enjoy researching those missing pieces of the puzzle - the ""unknown"" stuff. There are many segments here which will leave the most determined sleuth slack-jawed. We've read about many of these late career MB TV appearances and we are treated to lengthy excerpts - so many documentaries offer ""slide show"" bits and pieces.I was unaware of most of these kinescopes and am delighted to be able to view even a few seconds of them. The Groucho guest shot on The Jack Benny Show is in very good quality; the writing and performance is excellent. Both comedy legends get to do their thing in a classy setting. A long clip features Milton Berle and Harpo and similarly we get two for the price of one. Harpo is so good soloing and clowning in front of Uncle Miltie's orchestra, that Mr. Television himself has a hard time not laughing during the piece.I was fascinated to learn more about Groucho's struggle to keep a radio show in the '30s/'40s; and the origins and development of ""You Bet Your Life"". And to have George Fenneman on hand to reminisce is a great plus.As an Amazon reviewer points out, the documentary would have benefitted by including more of Zeppo and Gummo, and by offering criticism of the movies. They made many movies but unfortunately perhaps only four can be considered classics. Considering the level of talent on this team, it's really astonishing that Hollywood seemed to make a conscious decision at one point force them to work with second-rate material and directors not really suited to them.This offer is not as sophisticated as ""In A Nutshell"", in fact, Leslie Nielson's narration is curiously low-key, but this quiet, respectful program has enduring qualities. The children of Groucho, Chico, and Harpo, speak warmly of their parents. It's a nice touch that Harpo's son wrote original music for this package.",5,High marx!,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,1914,"['longtime', 'fans', 'absolutely', 'essential', 'especially', 'who', 'enjoy', 'researching', 'missing', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'unknown', 'stuff', 'are', 'many', 'segments', 'here', 'will', 'leave', 'most', 'determined', 'sleuth', 'slack-jawed', ""'ve"", 'read', 'many', 'late', 'career', 'MB', 'TV', 'appearances', 'are', 'treated', 'lengthy', 'excerpts', 'so', 'many', 'documentaries', 'offer', 'slide', 'show', 'bits', 'pieces.I', 'was', 'unaware', 'most', 'kinescopes', 'am', 'delighted', 'be', 'able', 'view', 'even', 'few', 'seconds', 'Groucho', 'guest', 'shot', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'Show', 'very', 'good', 'quality', 'writing', 'performance', 'excellent', 'comedy', 'get', 'do', 'thing', 'classy', 'setting', 'long', 'clip', 'features', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'Harpo', 'similarly', 'get', 'two', 'price', 'one', 'Harpo', 'so', 'good', 'soloing', 'clowning', 'front', 'Uncle', 'Miltie', 'orchestra', 'Mr.', 'Television', 'hard', 'time', 'not', 'laughing', 'piece.I', 'was', 'fascinated', 'learn', 'more', 'Groucho', 'struggle', 'keep', 'radio', 'show', ""'30s/'40s"", 'origins', 'development', 'Bet', 'Life', 'have', 'George', 'Fenneman', 'hand', 'reminisce', 'great', 'plus.As', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'points', 'out', 'documentary', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'including', 'more', 'Zeppo', 'Gummo', 'offering', 'criticism', 'movies', 'made', 'many', 'movies', 'unfortunately', 'perhaps', 'only', 'four', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'classics', 'Considering', 'level', 'talent', 'team', 'really', 'astonishing', 'Hollywood', 'seemed', 'make', 'conscious', 'decision', 'one', 'point', 'force', 'work', 'second-rate', 'material', 'directors', 'not', 'really', 'suited', 'them.This', 'offer', 'not', 'as', 'sophisticated', 'Nutshell', 'fact', 'Leslie', 'Nielson', 'narration', 'curiously', 'low-key', 'quiet', 'respectful', 'program', 'enduring', 'qualities', 'children', 'Groucho', 'Chico', 'Harpo', 'speak', 'warmly', 'parents', 'nice', 'touch', 'Harpo', 'son', 'wrote', 'original', 'music', 'package']",N/A
