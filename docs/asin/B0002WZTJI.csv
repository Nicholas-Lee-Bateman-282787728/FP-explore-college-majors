It's so great to see how much they loved the 60's and how much they helped influence that generation. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members and they're all still alive.........a great video that brings back lots of memories and insights into what it was all about . I didn't realize how often they were on the Smother's Brothers TV Show (several video/music clips of them on that show). The commentary is with the band members NOW, while the music video is all with the band back in the 60's.

848803,AP3VHIZBRGO9X,B0002WZTJI,"C. ANZIULEWICZ ""Chuck Anziulewicz""","[146, 147]","I guess I developed my appreciation for the Jefferson Airplane during my college years (1977-1981). I'm no child of the sixties, but my uncle went to Woodstock, and like many college students I learned of the magical powers of certain hallucinogenic substances. There is some ineffable quality in Jefferson Airplane's music that lends itself well to the psychedelic experience, and anyone who knows where I'm coming from ought to get this DVD. Apparently produced under the auspices of Airplane guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, this disc captures some of the magic of the San Francisco music scene, circa 1965-1972, and the pivotal role Jefferson Airplane played therein. That the members of the band are still alive and still relatively LUCID is nothing short of amazing, but if you are looking for dish, you won't find much here; there's nothing in the interviews that hints of the acrimony that sometimes flared during the band's heyday. But the musical performances: WOW! Where did they dig up some of these films? And how did they preserve them so well? Particularly fascinating for me is the performance of ""It's No Secret,"" featuring the band's FIRST female vocalist, Signe Anderson. Her presence is altogether different from that of her successor, Grace Slick, but there's something about the quality of her voice that always intrigued me. The performance is a heady mixture of exultant vocals, jubilant dancing in the audience, and of course those very trippy liquid light shows that Ms. Anderson's first husband was apparently responsible for. I don't think you can overestimate the archival value of ""Fly Jefferson Airplane.""

One of the most beautiful, mysterious, profound and revolutionary rock bands in history has finally been properly and gloriously documented on DVD.Could there be a Holier Grail for any lover of the REAL music of the `60's than this DVD, which is absolutely chock full of nearly every significant bit of Airplane performance footage in existence?  This isn't a reunion, this isn't a comeback.  This is genuine vintage footage; real, authentic, edgy, brilliant, fiery, psychedelic and soul-tattooing and I LOVE IT!!!For twenty years after the end of WWII, mainstream society tried to find a way to get comfortable with the Atomic Bomb.  Somehow, it was thought, ""normalcy"" could still prevail.  We thought that if we were out grilling red meat in the backyard one evening and suddenly saw a surprise sunrise, that we'd all just calmly go down into the concrete bunker next to the cabana, taking along our little umbrella drinks and making sure to help mom in her cocktail dress and heels.  We'd just buy a big can of radiation-reflecting hairspray and cake on the SPF 10,000 sun block with a trowel, and everything could go on just like before, right?  After all, the white men with crew cuts and dark blue polyester suits had everything under control and were going to take care of us.  How could anything bad happen?By 1965, there were masses and masses of people who were whispering, saying, shouting and finally screaming, ""F-K THAT!"" and Jefferson Airplane was one of the beacons, one of the lighthouses that these people turned to in search of new ways to think and new ways to be.  They were anti-establishment and counter-culture by choice and by conscience, because the ""establishment"" had brought everyone to the brink of incineration with the cooperation of a straight culture that was really just an attempt to normalize the official madness of the cold war.  I believe that, whether they know it or not, Jefferson Airplane and others like them helped prevent a nuclear ""exchange"" between Russia and America, and I also think that they and their peers played a large part in ending the crime against humanity that was happening in Vietnam.It doesn't matter who you are, you need to own this DVD.  It is a musically beautiful, socially relevant, mind-blowing image of a band that was fighting for all of our lives, and that was calling on all of us to have the courage to love without fear, love without hesitating, love without keeping score and most of all to love ourselves enough to demand peace and justice.",5,A must-own DVD,1106524800,"01 24, 2005",2005,2626,"['Oh', 'sweet', 'loving', 'God', 'thank', 'thank', 'THANK-YOU', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'have', 'finally', 'done', 'One', 'most', 'beautiful', 'mysterious', 'profound', 'revolutionary', 'rock', 'bands', 'history', 'finally', 'been', 'properly', 'gloriously', 'documented', 'DVD.Could', 'be', 'Holier', 'Grail', 'lover', 'REAL', 'music', '60', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'chock', 'full', 'nearly', 'significant', 'bit', 'Airplane', 'performance', 'footage', 'existence', ""n't"", 'reunion', ""n't"", 'comeback', 'genuine', 'vintage', 'footage', 'real', 'authentic', 'edgy', 'brilliant', 'fiery', 'psychedelic', 'soul-tattooing', 'LOVE', 'IT', 'twenty', 'years', 'end', 'WWII', 'mainstream', 'society', 'tried', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'comfortable', 'Atomic', 'Bomb', 'Somehow', 'was', 'thought', 'normalcy', 'could', 'still', 'prevail', 'thought', 'were', 'out', 'grilling', 'red', 'meat', 'backyard', 'one', 'evening', 'suddenly', 'saw', 'surprise', 'sunrise', ""'d"", 'just', 'calmly', 'go', 'down', 'concrete', 'bunker', 'cabana', 'taking', 'along', 'little', 'umbrella', 'drinks', 'making', 'sure', 'help', 'mom', 'cocktail', 'dress', 'heels', ""'d"", 'just', 'buy', 'big', 'can', 'radiation-reflecting', 'hairspray', 'cake', 'SPF', '10,000', 'sun', 'block', 'trowel', 'everything', 'could', 'go', 'just', 'before', 'right', 'white', 'men', 'crew', 'cuts', 'dark', 'blue', 'polyester', 'suits', 'had', 'everything', 'control', 'were', 'going', 'take', 'care', 'How', 'could', 'anything', 'bad', 'happen', '1965', 'were', 'masses', 'masses', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'whispering', 'saying', 'shouting', 'finally', 'screaming', 'F-K', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'was', 'one', 'beacons', 'one', 'lighthouses', 'people', 'turned', 'search', 'new', 'ways', 'think', 'new', 'ways', 'be', 'were', 'anti-establishment', 'counter-culture', 'choice', 'conscience', 'establishment', 'had', 'brought', 'everyone', 'brink', 'incineration', 'cooperation', 'straight', 'culture', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'attempt', 'normalize', 'official', 'madness', 'cold', 'war', 'believe', 'know', 'not', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'others', 'helped', 'prevent', 'nuclear', 'exchange', 'Russia', 'America', 'also', 'think', 'peers', 'played', 'large', 'part', 'ending', 'crime', 'humanity', 'was', 'happening', 'Vietnam.It', ""n't"", 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'need', 'own', 'DVD', 'musically', 'beautiful', 'socially', 'relevant', 'mind-blowing', 'image', 'band', 'was', 'fighting', 'lives', 'was', 'calling', 'have', 'courage', 'love', 'fear', 'love', 'hesitating', 'love', 'keeping', 'score', 'most', 'love', 'enough', 'demand', 'peace', 'justice']",N/A

848813,A1SKSWWQT1CFP7,B0002WZTJI,"pattic ""pattic171""","[17, 24]","This is a difficult video for me to review in a way. Hardcore fans of the Jefferson Airplane may as well skip over this one, as my comments are directed more toward other newcomers like myself.At 44, I am a few years too young to really be part of the JA's generation, having bought my first rock album in 1974. It's amazing how even a few, short, years can place you in an entirely different musical generation. I grew-up on the progressive rock virtuoso's and hard rock bands of the 70's, and even by 1975, the ""hippie generation"" seemed as old and quaint as Hair Bands did by 1994. Things change fast. In the last few years, I've tried to expand my musical palette a bit, and have begun seeking-out bands and genres that I missed over the years. A friend told me that ""Fly Jefferson Airplane"" was an excellent way to become acquainted with the bands music and philosophy, in a relatively concise way.Well first things first. If you are expecting a documentary, telling the history and story of the bands career, you will be disappointed. This is really just a collection of (complete) performance clips alternating between interviews with the band members. If you are interested in learning more about the band's history, you will probably want to try one of the books available.As a sampling of what the band was about musically, and performance-wise, this isn't a bad place to begin, with caveats. The video, for one, only covers the band's 60's period, the latest clip being from 1970. Performance clips include the expected hits ""White Rabbit"" and ""Somebody to Love"" (the only ones I had been familar-with)taken from television appearances, as well as actual concert film clips of lessser-known LP tracks.Although it was interesting to see the band play, the sound quality of these vintage clips was understandably not so good, especially the concert footage, making much of the band's sometimes less-than-concise jamming difficult to make-out.In other words, if you're new to the bands music, you may want to borrow a CD or two, to better hear what they are actually playing first.As a non-fan, i was suprised by how raw Marty Balin's vocals were compared to the 70's crooning I was used-to. Marty could actually deliver a good ballsy, rock vocal. Who knew?I was also suprised at what a charismatic front-woman Grace Slick turned out to be. She is one of those rare people that can command your attention without doing much other than stand there singing.Unfortunately, I can't say that from what I heard, the Airplane's music was quite my cup of tea. It was chock-a-block with off-key harmonies, barely-there arrangements, and guitar notes bent wayyy out of pitch, so if you are a ""muso"" type that like their music played in a more ""technically proficient"" way, this probably won't really move you either.  However, I will say this for them, their music is very unique, and sounds like no other band I've ever heard. There's no way you could ever confuse them with anyone else, and that might be the highest praise.After all, Les Paul once said:""You may have all you licks and chops down...but can your mother recognise you on the radio?""Judged by that standard, I would say Les would be pleased.Overall this is probably a terrific video for fans, but the iffy sound quality makes it not the best introduction to the band's music.

Most of the songs are taken from live concerts. If you really enjoy the Airplane and want more of a documentary/musiic DVD,then you will enjoy this. I would have preferered just the concert. It does give you a lot of info about the songs and the group members. It was enjoyable. The sound is good and the visual is clear. The project was wellproduced. It starts with the early songs and moves towards the later hits. It contains just 13 songs. My favorites are It's No Secret, White Rabbit and Embryonic Journey.

The development of the band's music from initial powerful electric folk to on the edge improvising and political stances is well captured (the live performance of ""The Ballad of you & Me & Pooneil"" at the Family Dogg being the standout). But what makes this more than just a video of live historical TV and movie performances is its structure provides a snapshot of the SF late 1960s era plus documenting the many different and powerful personalities. Balin comes across as simple songwriter and effective singer; Kantner complicated songwriter and sci-fi freak both being well matched by the dominant Grace Slick (chosen to give them an edge locally against Big Brother with Janis Joplin) who clearly was then the spark to all the others, including getting rid of Bill Graham as their manager and pushing on the three great musicians of Dryden (getting the drum seat after Skip Spence started being unreliant, despite being jazz orinetated, from LA and older than the others as Slick gleefully covers in her lyrical inspiration for ""Lather""), and the guitar powerhouse of Kaukonen and Cassady, the latter coming across in joint interviews as being much more attuned and closer than subsequent events might have indicated.The best San Francisco 1960s music related video releases I have seen to date.",5,An historic flight with JA,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,1745,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'just', 'hearing', 'death', 'Spencer', 'Dryden', 'only', 'served', 'underline', 'sadly', 'what', 'timely', 'release', 'demise', 'other', 'group', 'members.And', 'what', 'great', 'release', 'taking', 'chronolgical', 'order', 'history', 'group', 'members', 'great', 'JA', 'few', 'others', 'notably', 'Joey', 'Covington', 'Marvellous', 'Maurice', 'Ieracci', 'telling', 'how', 'really', 'was', 'various', 'recently', 'recorded', 'snippets', 'development', 'band', 'music', 'initial', 'powerful', 'electric', 'folk', 'edge', 'improvising', 'political', 'stances', 'well', 'captured', 'live', 'performance', 'Ballad', 'Me', 'Pooneil', 'Family', 'Dogg', 'being', 'standout', 'what', 'more', 'just', 'video', 'live', 'historical', 'TV', 'movie', 'performances', 'structure', 'snapshot', 'SF', 'late', '1960s', 'era', 'documenting', 'many', 'different', 'powerful', 'personalities', 'Balin', 'simple', 'songwriter', 'effective', 'singer', 'Kantner', 'complicated', 'songwriter', 'sci-fi', 'freak', 'being', 'well', 'matched', 'dominant', 'Grace', 'Slick', 'chosen', 'give', 'edge', 'locally', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'who', 'clearly', 'was', 'then', 'spark', 'others', 'including', 'getting', 'rid', 'Bill', 'Graham', 'manager', 'pushing', 'three', 'great', 'musicians', 'Dryden', 'getting', 'drum', 'seat', 'Skip', 'Spence', 'started', 'being', 'unreliant', 'being', 'jazz', 'orinetated', 'LA', 'older', 'others', 'Slick', 'gleefully', 'lyrical', 'inspiration', 'Lather', 'guitar', 'powerhouse', 'Kaukonen', 'Cassady', 'latter', 'coming', 'joint', 'interviews', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'attuned', 'closer', 'subsequent', 'events', 'might', 'have', 'indicated.The', 'best', 'San', 'Francisco', '1960s', 'music', 'related', 'video', 'releases', 'have', 'seen', 'date']",N/A
