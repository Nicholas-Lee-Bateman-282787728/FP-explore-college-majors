If you are Republican or were a Bush supporter, you will probably hate this show, perhaps even finding it offensive as Ferrell does not hold back in the least. If you are like me instead, wherein you hated W from day #1 of his presidency and thought every act he did as President was unexplainable lunacy, then you will love it.  The highlight for me is the part which is potentially the most offensive, a sexual come on and bump and grind between W and Condeleza Rice. Ferrell has been honing his W act to perfection for years and by now he has every nuance of W's movements and voice down.  He looks like him, sounds like him, and pretty much is him ""en flagrante"" for an entire HBO special. This recreates Ferrell's Broadway show on W which was a huge success.

Funny, biting, and ridiculous as the man himself, it was comedic perfection then, and it still is now.I was not looking for an overhaul of the past 8 years, I did not want to be stuck going through all the mistakes this one man made, whether humorous or not.  I did not want an over politicized evening of hatred with a thin guise of humor.  And I am glad because ""You're Welcome, America"" is none of that.  With completely false anecdotes, actual hilarious quotes, and some of the most traumatizing images I have ever seen on a TV screen, it was nothing I was expecting, but a complete success.  If you have seen Funny or Die, you know how far he can go.Although I can agree with some that there definitely some ""safe"" parts to his performance, I was happy to see Ferrell reign it in at times (like discussing 9/11 or when discussing the lost soldiers of this current war).  It was nice to see the full range of insanity and respect in one show.Happily, the over-the-top shenanigans do not end after this program.  The special features are good as well.  W interviews himself (which did seem to run a little long for my taste) and there is a true/false trivia game to play.  All in all, a night well spent with Will Ferrell as George W.

1243502,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,B001VEJK6Y,Dave,"[0, 0]","Will did a great job delivering this show with little interruption necessary to prepare between segments.  His George Bush character is good but not the best, somewhat limited by his own physical appearance.  Parts of the show were very funny, but parts denigrated Bush and members of his cabinet with extraneous dirt that never took place for the sake of creating personally debasing humor that was undeserved.  I tried to judge his humor as an independent I am and not wed to party politics and ideologies.  From my perspective, I found much of the show to be way off base and lacking in humor or irony.  Those who hate Bush will probably love this routine, those who thought highly of Bush will not.  Those who appreciate humor and irony will most likely be disappointed.  I would have rated it with 2 stars but Ferrell's delivery elevated it a notch from its base themes.  It's too bad that this show did not take on the benefit of time where Bush could have blamed Obama for the future, even though he has withheld criticism since he left office.  Bush made mistakes but he never blamed Clinton for his mistakes.  Think about the difference in character between Bush and Obama.  Only those who would vilify Bush to exaggeration would use such to elevate Obama in comparison.

He covers a variety of issues, such as the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina (and his supposed infatuation with Condaleeza Rice- that part seems to be an embellishment).
