[Can you believe this talk?] This provides a background. Then ""Ed"" calls in about this subject! We see past history about Norman Bates. A girl gets out of an old car and makes an offer to him. [Believable?] ""Unhook me."" ""Is it a good smell?"" What was that noise? Mother talks to Norman. [You know what will happen next.] Has this story lost its shock value? [Is the movie being drawn out?] Does the talk provide any value? His father was stung to death by bees. Next we see a teenaged Norman. It keeps getting worse. Did jealousy motivate him? Is his problem due to genetics? Was his mother going crazy? Is the story embarrassing? Should they call the police? [Yes!]There is another flashback. [The convention in some murder mysteries is to have a nasty person wind up as the murder victim.] There is a squabble at the radio station. Ratings count, whatever it takes. [Note how the announcer steers the conversation.] Remember glass bottles for milk and orange juice? ""Good toast."" Can Norman learn to box? [What does he do in school?] This movie says Norman used strychnine. Does that leave signs on the victim? One false fact is Norman talking about a murder gene [in the 1950s]. Children of murderers do not become murderers (as with ""H. H. Holmes""). ""He poisoned us."" Norman increases his body count. [Two deaths but no coroner's inquest?] They certainly emphasize the horror! Will Norman's wife become the next victim? ""What are we doing here?"" [Watching the worst movie of the year.]Connie wants a strong and healthy baby. They go up the stairs. Norman gets that big butcher knife. Connie decides it is time to leave. [Again this story is drawn out for added suspense.] ""Look at yourself."" ""No more blood."" Norman appears to have recovered. He will burn down this Second Empire mansion to get rid of his memories. But his memories return. These scenes are both funny and embarrassing. ""I'm free."" [Note how that mansion is smaller on the outside than suggested by its interior rooms.] Will they live happily ever after? [I doubt it.]If the producers lost money is serves them right. Was this a surprising horror movie? Or some sort of educational movie? None of the above. [""Silence of the Lambs"" had more horror.] Would a psycho serial killer like Norman Bates ever be released in the real world?

I've got the tape, but you know, these things don't last forever. :-)I really think the Psycho films were truly among the last truly quality horror film series.  The film, unfortunately did not benefit from a theatrical release.  It was, instead, sent directly to the Showtime cable network in 1990.  This was a time when moviegoing horror fans were been subjected to the 5th ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" film and the EIGHTH in the ""Friday the 13th"" series.  I guess Psycho IV's producer weren't confident that aging psychopath Norman Bates (and aging actor Anthony Perkins) would find much of an audience among the slaser fans.And that's a shame, because both Perkins and the film itself offer a worthy conclusion to the series.  Psycho IV was written by Joseph Stefano, who wrote the original film based on Robert Bloch's novel.  Stefano, himself a long-time recipient of psychoanalysis, gives the story of Norman Bates' childhood a harrowing (yet occasionally poetic) realism.  And although Perkins' role is reduced due to about 70 percent of the story being presented as flashbacks, it just might be his best performance ouf of all four films.Now that Universal has finally given us decent DVD releases of Psycho 2 and 3, it's time to complete the series.",4,A teriffic finale to the series...now where's the DVD??,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,1371,"['Now', 'VHS', 'version', 'longer', 'even', 'available', 'Universal', 'simply', 'MUST', 'release', 'superior', 'sequel', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'got', 'tape', 'know', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'forever', 'really', 'think', 'Psycho', 'films', 'were', 'truly', 'last', 'truly', 'quality', 'horror', 'film', 'series', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'benefit', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'instead', 'sent', 'directly', 'Showtime', 'cable', 'network', '1990', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'moviegoing', 'horror', 'fans', 'were', 'been', 'subjected', '5th', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'film', 'EIGHTH', 'Friday', '13th', 'series', 'guess', 'Psycho', 'IV', 'producer', 'were', ""n't"", 'confident', 'aging', 'psychopath', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'aging', 'actor', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'would', 'find', 'much', 'audience', 'slaser', 'fans.And', 'shame', 'Perkins', 'film', 'offer', 'worthy', 'conclusion', 'series', 'Psycho', 'IV', 'was', 'written', 'Joseph', 'Stefano', 'who', 'wrote', 'original', 'film', 'based', 'Robert', 'Bloch', 'novel', 'Stefano', 'long-time', 'recipient', 'psychoanalysis', 'story', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'childhood', 'harrowing', 'yet', 'occasionally', 'poetic', 'realism', 'Perkins', 'role', 'reduced', 'due', '70', 'percent', 'story', 'being', 'presented', 'flashbacks', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'performance', 'ouf', 'four', 'films.Now', 'Universal', 'finally', 'given', 'decent', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Psycho', '2', '3', 'time', 'complete', 'series']",N/A

Alfred Hitchcock's orginal unforgettable masterpiece was something else both in it's content and it's influence. Yet, in the forty years since it's conception it has had three theatrical  sequels and one T.V. movie called Bated Motel based on the story. Don't  forget all the similar roles poor Perkins got typecast into playing. All  these films did nothing more than mimic Anthony Perkins mannerisms from the  orginal Psycho or play an updated inferior re-issue of Bernard Hermann's  classic screeching violin theme. There has been nothing substanial or even  minute gained from all these clones, homages, amd imagination-less  interptations of the 1960 Hitchcock masterwork. ENOUGH  ALREADY!  The sequel is an invention of Hollywood's lack of  creativity. I can only name  six or seven sequels that come anywhere near  the quality of the orginal film. Psycho 4 is definitely no among them.  Anthony Perkins plays the role admirably, and Joseph Stefano has some  interesting deviations on the classic Norman Bates myth., but due to all  the ineptness that came before it.

This unique framing story allows Anthony Perkins to remain in the prequel as our narrator, often injecting himself as a spectator to his own troubled past. Though many may say that PSYCHO needs no introduction, others will argue that Joseph Stefano's treatment delivers a welcomed back story to the screen's most infamous killer. With the stunning Olivia Hussey playing Mrs. Bates, it is no wonder Norman developed such an odd relationship with his mother. Norma's wicked treatment of her son through verbal castration and taunting sexual torments makes it quite clear why Norman should turn out the way he has. But Hussey also embraces the kinder moments, giving us a dual perspective that accounts for Norman's love and obsession with his mother. Henry Thomas is competent as the young Norman, but his performance is lacking in personality.

From the home he shares with his wife (a nurse from the institution), he phones in to a radio show that's featuring a program about matricide.  Gaining the compassion of the deejay (and the animosity of the psychiatrist who analyzed him at the conclusion of the first film who happens to be in the studio), Norman recalls his childhood and teenage years.  Olivia Hussey plays his mother, who definitely sets a crazy precedent for her son to follow.  Henry Thomas plays young Norman and does well, with all the appropriate twitches.  Film does have inconsistencies with the other films which fans should notice.  Some of the flashbacks we see are very well done, other scenes are laughable.

The original premise was to have Norman and a girl escape the institution and return to the house and the motel, where it is now a tourist attraction/theme park.

And for all it has going against it, I really think Psycho 4 rises up to the occassion.Mick Garris is an interesting director and he has quite a tallent at injecting the feeling of cinema into the television screen. He flirts with the melodramatic and the absurd, with the sensitive and the baroque. The screenplay is competent, but lacks the guidance and influence of Robert Bloch- who wrote the original novel. That said, it compassionatley melds old with new in this psychological thriller that lives up to the genre dictations. It is works as an Oedeipus Pyshchological-drama and delivers enough thrills to satisfy this particular fan.All of the performances are excellent, with Hussey a highlight, but it is Perkin's- the trooper, who carries the film.The resurrection of the original score is fun, especially after the synthisized gasps of part 3 and the Goldsmith imitation in part 2.This film lacks the structure and originality of the original, but contains a sensitivity the Franklin sequel lacked. That said, it lacks the brutal frights of part 2. It rekindles the Hitchockian flame, a releif after the (perhaps welcome...) departure in style that was Perkin's direction in part 3.

As well as this, the music from the original  Psycho soundtrack is included..unlike the prequels Psycho 2 and 3. This  provides tension and thrills to the movie.  Psycho 4 was an excellent idea.  All die-hard Psycho fans wanted some history on Norman and his mother. This  film provided questions we all wanted to know. What drove Norman to murder?  Why was his mother so cruel? But this film has one fatal flaw. The plot is  ignored... Mrs. Spool (apparently Norman's real mother is not mentioned in  this film ) Mrs. Bates seems to be Norman's biological mother. And the plot  is incredible in the fact that Norman Bates is found out to have murdered  again in the last film. Yet he gets out 4 years later? That doesn't make  sense. But apart from this, this is a tense thriller as Norman talks with a  radio host, telling his childhood and the possibility despite pleas from  the radio host that Norman will kill again.

Farmbrough ""Dave Farmbrough""","[2, 2]","This is surprisingly good, the return to form being more down to the return of original Psycho scriptwriter Joseph Stephano than anything else. The story again takes on a more psychological approach and analyses problems rather than just being the stalk and slash frenzy of its predecessor. That doesn't mean it lacks thrills, and there are plenty of these as the film flashes back to Norman's childhood. The recasting of the young Norman (E.T. star Henry Thomas) and his mother is effective, but once again, it's Anthony Perkins who steals the show.

The usual set of the Bates Motel is abandoned by Norman, and to some extent we feel as safe as he does in his 1980s house until he returns to the Motel at the last minute and keeps us in suspense until the end of the movie. This works well and is largely due to retaining some of the main factors that made the original work, Perkins, Stephano, but also in moving on from the hotel and changing the style slightly.

It was wonderfully written by Joseph Stefano (writer of the original Psycho). Norman (Anthony Perkins) is out on parol, after his too-funny-for-words murderous rampage in Psycho III. He calls in to a radio talk show - the topic: matricide (killing of one's mother). We soon delve into Norman's psyche - going back to his childhood, and he explains, with the help of Henry Thomas (young Norman) what drove him to killing his mother (Olivia Hussey) and several other victims.We soon find out that he is married and that his wife is pregnant. Norman is afraid that his child is going to grow up just like him, so he calls his wife and asks her to meet him at his mother's creeky house on the hill. The house is a great set piece for a fantastic conclusion to, not only this movie, but hopefully the series. Filmed at Universal Studio's, Florida.

This includes the awful remake (scene for scene almost) starring Anne Heche.Anthony Perkins did a fabulous job this time out as Norman Bates. Psycho 3 was almost the death of the series, and not to take away from Anthony Perkins and his wonderful character, but his directing job was pathetic along with much of the acting (even Anthony wasn't top-notch in Psycho 3).Back to Psycho IV, Henry Thomas did an outstanding job as the young Norman Bates. He played up the torture of this young man by his psychotic mother. Anthony Perkins is also top-notch and stole the movie as current day Norman Bates and his fight to be rehabilitated. This movie had a great story and the only thing bad about it is you are left wishing there was more, but there never will be for Anthony Perkins and those of us who were big fans of his.Olivia Hussey is amazing as a younger version of Norman's mother. She is sweet one moment and crazy the next, keeping the audience and Norman on our toes. It is nice how they explained away Norman aging his mother in his mind, because we were always left to think his mother was old. In fact since she lived on through Norman himself, she did grow older with him. Olivia's portrayal of Norman's mother is among her best acting jobs ever alongside her work in Black Christmas (another Halloween-like horror movie with lots of spooky atmosphere) and Mary in Jesus Of Nazareth. She left me wanting to see more of her scene-stealing.Speaking of stealing scenes, this movie has three actors who does so. Henry Thomas leaves you wanting to see more of him as young Norman, Olivia Hussey does the same as Norman's mother and, of course, Anthony Perkins leaves us with a great performance to remember him by. There will never be another Norman Bates like him.Mick Garris did a great job directing here. He resisted the urge to be gory, and left us with a haunting, atmospheric movie that reminds me of the great horror movies of the 70's & early 80's (Halloween, The Shining, The Fog, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday The 13th etc). Mick did such a great job directing this that I thought, in my original review, that John Landis directed this. While Landis did not direct this movie, he had a nice bit character playing the producer of the radio call-in show Norman is revealing his terrifying past to, Landis was funny, but also played his character very well for someone who normally directs, not act.This film is VERY underrated. One of the most underrated horror movies ever and should have been given a big-screen showing. If the awful remake could be shown on the big-screen, this one should have been.I liked that sex and the taboo aspect of it was played up in this movie. Norman's mother didn't want Norman thinking dirty thoughts, looking at naked women in magazines and the like, but she teased him unmercifully. This added to his resentment towards her.Story & mood had a lot to do with me liking this film. They explained away some of the mystery of the series, but at the same time added more mystery. Why was Norman's mom like she was? Why did she punish Norman yet seem to love him at times?I would love for this movie to be on DVD. Even if it is a bare-bones version like parts II & III. This movie is really up there with part II in my opinion.

296393,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6302113172,trebe,"[1, 1]","A breakthrough in horror, Psycho (1960) arguably launched the slasher genre.  After the passage of over twenty years, Psycho II (1983) continued Hitchcock's classic tale.  Psycho III (1986) picked up the story, which concluded with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), apparently on his way back to the funny farm.  In Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990), Perkins returns for the final time as Norman Bates.  Before you proceed, be advised that major spoilers follow.In the previous films, it was revealed that Norman Bates had been a mama's boy, who while a teen, killed his mother.  In Psycho IV, the details of this event are revealed in a series of flashbacks.  Norman Bates is still battling his inner demons, but somehow has been released again, and is married to a psychologist that treated him.  When a talk radio show is discussing matricide, Norman calls in and begins talking about his past.  The flashbacks feature Henry Thomas as the young Norman, and Olivia Hussey as his controlling mother, Norma Bates.Norman's relationship with his mother was twisted and dysfunctional, but matters took a turn for the worse when his mother took a live-in lover.  Being replaced by another man in his mother's life, pushed Norman over the edge, and he poisoned and killed both his mother, and her lover.  Norman also recounts how as ""Mother"", he also murdered several women who were attracted to him.In the film's third act, the focus shifts to the present, where Norman meets his pregnant wife Connie (Donna Mitchell) at the run down and decaying Bates residence.  While what happens as Norman confronts his past seems rather clich&eacute;d, it does bring to a close the Norman Bates saga with Anthony Perkins.While Psycho IV apparently clears up some questions about Norman's past, it also raises a few about the infamous voice of ""Mother"" that has been more or less constant since the original film.  The voice has been harsh, sounding like an older woman, but with no accent at all.  Olivia Hussey however, has a strong British accent.  Although Norma Bates died as a young woman, Norman strangely recreates the voice as being from someone much older, and with no British accent.Olivia Hussey seems a curious choice as Norma Bates.  While she gives a solid performance, and certainly has a strong controlling personality, her British accent just doesn't match the Psycho mythology.  Henry Thomas is easier to accept as the young Norman Bates.  He does shocked innocence well, although he doesn't display the scary edge that Perkins brings to the role, and is rather unconvincing in a wig and dress.  Perkins displays an undercurrent of madness for most of the film.  His scenes of emotional conflict with Donna Mitchell are kind of awkward, although he does a pretty fair job in the final scenes where the house is burning.  C.C.H. Pounder, is engaging as talk radio host, Fran Ambrose.While perhaps not really necessary, Psycho IV does bring closure to the saga that began thirty years before with Hitchcock's stunning shocker.  It answers some questions that a few may have been concerned about, while raising others that are mostly minor loose ends.  Under the direction of Mick Garris, the performances are good, although the story structure, which alternates between the present and violence in the past, kind of blunts tension and overall impact of the film.  If you are interested in all the Psycho sequels, the two disc Psycho triple featurePsycho II / Psycho III / Psycho IV - The Beginning (Triple Feature)is an excellent value, and currently the only way to get Psycho IV on DVD.  And for those who crave even more, there is the 2010 documentaryThe Psycho Legacy.",3,a creative and interesting finish that brings the Psycho Saga full circle...,1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,3669,"['breakthrough', 'horror', 'Psycho', '1960', 'arguably', 'launched', 'slasher', 'genre', 'passage', 'twenty', 'years', 'Psycho', 'II', '1983', 'continued', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'tale', 'Psycho', 'III', '1986', 'picked', 'up', 'story', 'concluded', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'apparently', 'way', 'back', 'funny', 'farm', 'Psycho', 'IV', 'Beginning', '1990', 'Perkins', 'final', 'time', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'proceed', 'be', 'advised', 'major', 'spoilers', 'follow.In', 'previous', 'films', 'was', 'revealed', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'had', 'been', 'mama', 'boy', 'who', 'teen', 'killed', 'mother', 'Psycho', 'IV', 'details', 'event', 'are', 'revealed', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'still', 'battling', 'inner', 'demons', 'somehow', 'been', 'released', 'again', 'married', 'psychologist', 'treated', 'When', 'talk', 'radio', 'show', 'discussing', 'matricide', 'Norman', 'talking', 'past', 'flashbacks', 'feature', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'young', 'Norman', 'Olivia', 'Hussey', 'controlling', 'mother', 'Norma', 'Bates.Norman', 'relationship', 'mother', 'was', 'twisted', 'dysfunctional', 'matters', 'took', 'turn', 'worse', 'when', 'mother', 'took', 'live-in', 'lover', 'Being', 'replaced', 'man', 'mother', 'life', 'pushed', 'Norman', 'edge', 'poisoned', 'killed', 'mother', 'lover', 'Norman', 'also', 'how', 'Mother', 'also', 'murdered', 'several', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'attracted', 'him.In', 'film', 'third', 'act', 'focus', 'shifts', 'present', 'where', 'Norman', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Connie', 'Donna', 'Mitchell', 'run', 'down', 'decaying', 'Bates', 'residence', 'what', 'Norman', 'past', 'rather', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'bring', 'close', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'saga', 'Anthony', 'Perkins.While', 'Psycho', 'IV', 'apparently', 'up', 'questions', 'Norman', 'past', 'also', 'few', 'infamous', 'voice', 'Mother', 'been', 'more', 'less', 'constant', 'original', 'film', 'voice', 'been', 'harsh', 'sounding', 'older', 'woman', 'accent', 'Olivia', 'Hussey', 'however', 'strong', 'British', 'accent', 'Norma', 'Bates', 'died', 'young', 'woman', 'Norman', 'strangely', 'voice', 'being', 'someone', 'much', 'older', 'British', 'accent.Olivia', 'Hussey', 'curious', 'choice', 'Norma', 'Bates', 'solid', 'performance', 'certainly', 'strong', 'controlling', 'personality', 'British', 'accent', 'just', ""n't"", 'match', 'Psycho', 'mythology', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'easier', 'accept', 'young', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'shocked', 'innocence', 'well', ""n't"", 'display', 'scary', 'edge', 'brings', 'role', 'rather', 'unconvincing', 'wig', 'dress', 'Perkins', 'undercurrent', 'madness', 'most', 'film', 'scenes', 'emotional', 'conflict', 'Donna', 'Mitchell', 'are', 'kind', 'awkward', 'pretty', 'fair', 'job', 'final', 'scenes', 'where', 'house', 'burning', 'C.C.H', 'Pounder', 'engaging', 'talk', 'radio', 'host', 'Fran', 'Ambrose.While', 'perhaps', 'not', 'really', 'necessary', 'Psycho', 'IV', 'bring', 'closure', 'saga', 'began', 'thirty', 'years', 'Hitchcock', 'stunning', 'shocker', 'questions', 'few', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'concerned', 'raising', 'others', 'are', 'mostly', 'minor', 'loose', 'ends', 'direction', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'story', 'structure', 'present', 'violence', 'past', 'kind', 'blunts', 'tension', 'overall', 'impact', 'film', 'are', 'interested', 'Psycho', 'sequels', 'two', 'disc', 'Psycho', 'triple', 'featurePsycho', 'II', '/', 'Psycho', 'III', '/', 'Psycho', 'IV', 'Beginning', 'Triple', 'Feature', 'excellent', 'value', 'currently', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'Psycho', 'IV', 'DVD', 'who', 'crave', 'even', 'more', '2010', 'documentaryThe', 'Psycho', 'Legacy']",N/A

296396,AP3B615GM191G,6302113172,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","After pretty much determining the future of the Norman Bates character in the terrible third sequel, this fourth effort instead takes a look back at the most grotesque mother-son relationship in the history of cinema.For a basic plot summary, ""Psycho 4"" sees Bates (Anthony Perkins) call into a late-night radio show dealing with the crime of matricide.  Through flashbacks, Norman describes the key moments of his childhood that eventually led him to become the strange character we all know.In terms of just overall plot and drama, this is a pretty good film.  It paints a very interesting portrait of Mr. Bates, and ultimately helps us understand why he makes the major, final decision of his life at the film's conclusion.  In comparison to other horror film sequels, this one stands up quite nicely.The major problem with the movie, though, are the parts set in the present-day.  The huge plot hole is that the Norman Bates we see in this installment could seemingly never have emerged from the complete maniac present at the end of part three, with little to no explanation of the dramatic turnaround.  Essentially, the flashbacks are intriguing but the ""current"" storyline goes lacking.Of course, a review of any ""Psycho"" film would not be complete without a critique of Anthony Perkins' performance, as he (once Hitchcock bowed out) become the face of the franchise.  Though I have to give Perkins credit for turning in a spectacular performance (well, four of them really), there is also a hint of desperation that is kind of sad, considering that Perkins' only other notable career role is playing Jimmy Piersall in ""Fear Strikes Out"".  However, that being said, I can't imagine the Psycho franchise without him.Thus, while this film isn't a classic by any means, it is decent horror/drama and a fitting wrap to one of the most psychologically-intriguing horror series of all-time.  It still doesn't hold a candle to the original, but also doesn't drag things on like Halloween or Friday the 13th, either.",3,The Mother Behind The Man,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,2015,"['pretty', 'much', 'determining', 'future', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'character', 'terrible', 'third', 'sequel', 'fourth', 'effort', 'instead', 'look', 'back', 'most', 'grotesque', 'mother-son', 'relationship', 'history', 'cinema.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Psycho', '4', 'sees', 'Bates', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'call', 'late-night', 'radio', 'show', 'dealing', 'crime', 'matricide', 'flashbacks', 'Norman', 'key', 'moments', 'childhood', 'eventually', 'led', 'become', 'strange', 'character', 'know.In', 'terms', 'just', 'overall', 'plot', 'drama', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'portrait', 'Mr.', 'Bates', 'ultimately', 'understand', 'why', 'major', 'final', 'decision', 'life', 'film', 'conclusion', 'comparison', 'other', 'horror', 'film', 'sequels', 'one', 'quite', 'nicely.The', 'major', 'problem', 'movie', 'are', 'parts', 'set', 'present-day', 'huge', 'plot', 'hole', 'Norman', 'see', 'installment', 'could', 'seemingly', 'never', 'have', 'emerged', 'complete', 'maniac', 'present', 'end', 'part', 'three', 'little', 'explanation', 'dramatic', 'turnaround', 'Essentially', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'intriguing', 'current', 'storyline', 'lacking.Of', 'course', 'review', 'Psycho', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'complete', 'critique', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'performance', 'once', 'Hitchcock', 'bowed', 'out', 'become', 'face', 'franchise', 'have', 'give', 'Perkins', 'credit', 'turning', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'well', 'four', 'really', 'also', 'hint', 'desperation', 'kind', 'sad', 'considering', 'Perkins', 'only', 'other', 'notable', 'career', 'role', 'playing', 'Jimmy', 'Piersall', 'Fear', 'Out', 'However', 'being', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Psycho', 'franchise', 'him.Thus', 'film', ""n't"", 'classic', 'means', 'decent', 'horror/drama', 'fitting', 'wrap', 'one', 'most', 'psychologically-intriguing', 'horror', 'series', 'all-time', 'still', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'original', 'also', ""n't"", 'drag', 'things', 'Halloween', 'Friday', '13th', 'either']",N/A
