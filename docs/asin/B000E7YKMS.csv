970123,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B000E7YKMS,Annie Van Auken,"[0, 0]","Based on Corrine Griffith's memoirs, PAPA'S DELICATE CONDITION is a turn-of-the-century story of a man who'd do anything to please his wife and family, except give up drinking. Griffith's alcoholism causes some outrageous behavior, like his awarding the next door neighbor a prize of a newly-painted house, or buying an ice cream parlor so his daughter's dessert will be just as she wants it. He also gives young Corrie an entire circus when all she'd asked for was a pony.It's a bittersweet family movie that's by turns whimsical and melancholy. Marital problems of an otherwise ""proper"" couple are not at all glossed over. The complicated Jack Griffith is arguably Jackie Gleason's best film portrayal; certainly this character's battle with Demon Booze hits close to home, as well.""Papa's"" TRIVIA--Originally planned as a 1955 starring vehicle for Fred Astaire, who lost interest in the project.

970125,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000E7YKMS,David Baldwin,"[6, 6]","When Jackie Gleason passed some years ago I remember a couple of tidbits from his obituary.  One relates a doctor telling him that he had lung cancer and suggesting that he cut back on his smoking.  Heeding his doctor's advice Gleason cut back from six packs a day to four packs.  Gleason had his own little Algonquin Round Circle that consisted of Salvador Dali and Mickey Mantle among others.  What did these seeming unlike public figures have in common?  A love of the bottle.  Gleason made something of a mark in films after his ""Honeymooners"" heyday.  He was absolutely mesmerizing as Minnesota Fats in ""The Hustler"".  I'm still waiting for a DVD release of ""Soldier in the Rain"" with Steve McQueen.  ""Papa's Delicate Condition"" is an interesting film in that it was probably promoted as a comedy but dig a little deeper it's a sober look at the scourge of alcoholism.  Gleason's Jack Griffiths is one of those larger-than-life gregarious personalities whose impulsive behaviour, usually when soused, that wins over some people particularly his impressionable six year old daughter.  Not so his wife and older daughter.  Why I don't rate this film five stars is it's not written explicitly that Griffiths is a self-destructive personality.  Gleason, probably through personal experience, reads between the lines like he implicitly knows Jack Griffiths.  This is not a slurring, stumbling, stereotypical drunk.  Griffiths on the surface appears rather sober but underneath is destroying himself with liquor.  This is an average film raised to the next level by a great performance.

970133,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000E7YKMS,Robert Badgley,"[2, 2]","I have always considered 1963's movie ""Papa's Delicate Condition"" to be a sweet,sentimental and very endearing piece of film.The movie is based on silent screen actress Corinne Griffiths' 1952 novel of the same name about her childhood in Texas.It is directed by George Marshall,famous for his working with Laurel and Hardy in the 1930s at Hal Roach studios.It certainly rates high on my list of all time favourite movies.The film stars Jackie Gleason as railroad supervisor Jack Griffith and his  wife Ambolyn played by Glynnis Johns(soon to become a household name from ""Mary Poppins"").He has two daughters teenage Augusta and the apple of his eye Corrie.Seems ""Papa"" has a more than little penchant for imbibing on occasion,much to his flustered wifes' chagrin.In these times it's teenage Augusta and Amobolyn who ""team"" up against Jack and his only ally little Corrie who adores her doting father.And who can blame little Corrie for her love of a Dad who when trying to buy a small pony and cart for his daughter,ends up buying the entire circus in which they belong? But Jack is really a misunderstood man who will go to any lengths to please his family and others.For example there was a house in the familie's neighbourhood that had an awful shade of purple painted on its' front.Ambolyn comments that she would be eternally grateful to anyone that would remove that blight from her sight.Jack immediately concocts a scheme to trick the owner into believing he has won a contest to have his house repainted(white is the only colour ""available""!).Jack and Corrie are the painters,much to Ambolyns' startling discovery,but it's the thought that earns Jack a respectful peck on the cheek from his wife.In another example to help out a young,poorly paid and mistreated employee of a local drugstore Jack buys the store lock,stock and barrel.He then makes the youngster the manager who is now boss over his former skin-flint employer! Revenge is sweet indeed.When Ambolyn finds out about this financial transaction she hits the roof.Even though Jack has obtained financial backing and part ownership from other friends which will make the store a steady income earner(no dummy is Jack!),his wife is still not assuaged.She mistakenly thinks it's another sign of his ""condition"" and takes the family back to her fathers' house in Texas,one Mayor Ghio,played well by veteran stage and screen actor Charles Ruggles.Many will recall Ruggles voice overs in the cartoons of Rocky and Bullwinkle's ""Aesop Fables"" segments.Well if the mountain won't come to Mohammed,Jack takes his circus down to Texarkana,Texas just in time to help out his father in laws' re-election campaign.During the parade Ambolyn falls after chasing Jack and Corrie in the pony and cart,hurting her hand.She is a piano player and the doctor says she may never play again.Ambolyn and family return home and Jack returns to the railroad and buries himself in his work,refusing to touch alcohol.A tearful Corrie beseeches her Grandfather to find her Dad which he promises he will and does.Jack returns home only to have second thoughts at the front gate.Ambolyn finally lets go her stubborness and the strains of Jacks' favourite song ""Bill Bailey"" are soon emanating from the household piano,which draws Jack inside and a happily ever after reunion.Rarely does this film falter and only then to try and further the plot.The relationship of father and daughter here is the keystone of this film and it works beautifully.Even though we never forget who is playing the dad,as there are alot of in-references to the real Gleason in the film,they couldn't have made a better choice for the part.The chemistry between him and little Linda Bruhl(Corrie) was magical.Johns plays the hurt and frustrated wife to a tee and Laurel Goodwin(Augusta) plays her part with just the right amount of teenage angst.To top everything this movie garnered an Oscar for best song that year;""Call Me Irrresponsible"".Sung by Gleason,in that ""condition"", to a tailors' headless dummy! It has to be seen to be appreciated.One of the Great Ones' finest on screen moments!All in all ""Papa's Delicate Condition"" is a film I recommend highly.It is presented here in a very good print and transfer in its' original widescreen aspect ratio of 1:78.It's a good and wholesome film for the entire family and,unless you're made of wood,it will tug mightily at your heart strings throughout.",4,A Sweet and Endearing Family Movie!,1224374400,"10 19, 2008",2008,4419,"['have', 'always', 'considered', '1963', 'movie', 'Papa', 'Delicate', 'Condition', 'be', 'sweet', 'sentimental', 'very', 'endearing', 'piece', 'film.The', 'movie', 'based', 'silent', 'screen', 'actress', 'Corinne', 'Griffiths', '1952', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'childhood', 'Texas.It', 'directed', 'George', 'Marshall', 'famous', 'working', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', '1930s', 'Hal', 'Roach', 'studios.It', 'certainly', 'rates', 'high', 'list', 'time', 'favourite', 'movies.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'railroad', 'supervisor', 'Jack', 'Griffith', 'wife', 'Ambolyn', 'played', 'Glynnis', 'Johns', 'soon', 'become', 'household', 'name', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '.He', 'two', 'daughters', 'teenage', 'Augusta', 'apple', 'eye', 'Corrie.Seems', 'Papa', 'more', 'little', 'penchant', 'imbibing', 'occasion', 'much', 'flustered', 'wifes', 'chagrin.In', 'times', 'teenage', 'Augusta', 'Amobolyn', 'who', 'team', 'up', 'Jack', 'only', 'ally', 'little', 'Corrie', 'who', 'doting', 'father.And', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'little', 'Corrie', 'love', 'Dad', 'who', 'when', 'trying', 'buy', 'small', 'pony', 'cart', 'daughter', 'up', 'buying', 'entire', 'circus', 'belong', 'Jack', 'really', 'misunderstood', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'go', 'lengths', 'please', 'family', 'others.For', 'example', 'was', 'house', 'familie', 'neighbourhood', 'had', 'awful', 'shade', 'purple', 'painted', 'front.Ambolyn', 'comments', 'would', 'be', 'eternally', 'grateful', 'anyone', 'would', 'remove', 'blight', 'sight.Jack', 'immediately', 'scheme', 'trick', 'owner', 'believing', 'won', 'contest', 'have', 'house', 'repainted', 'white', 'only', 'available', '.Jack', 'Corrie', 'are', 'painters', 'much', 'Ambolyns', 'startling', 'discovery', 'thought', 'Jack', 'respectful', 'peck', 'cheek', 'wife.In', 'example', 'help', 'out', 'young', 'poorly', 'paid', 'mistreated', 'employee', 'local', 'drugstore', 'Jack', 'store', 'lock', 'stock', 'barrel.He', 'then', 'youngster', 'manager', 'who', 'now', 'former', 'skin-flint', 'employer', 'Revenge', 'sweet', 'indeed.When', 'Ambolyn', 'out', 'financial', 'transaction', 'roof.Even', 'Jack', 'obtained', 'financial', 'backing', 'part', 'ownership', 'other', 'friends', 'will', 'make', 'store', 'steady', 'income', 'earner', 'dummy', 'Jack', 'wife', 'still', 'not', 'assuaged.She', 'mistakenly', 'sign', 'condition', 'family', 'back', 'fathers', 'house', 'Texas', 'one', 'Mayor', 'Ghio', 'played', 'well', 'veteran', 'stage', 'screen', 'actor', 'Charles', 'Ruggles.Many', 'will', 'recall', 'Ruggles', 'voice', 'overs', 'cartoons', 'Rocky', 'Bullwinkle', 'Aesop', 'Fables', 'segments.Well', 'mountain', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'Mohammed', 'Jack', 'circus', 'down', 'Texarkana', 'Texas', 'just', 'time', 'help', 'out', 'father', 'laws', 're-election', 'campaign.During', 'parade', 'Ambolyn', 'chasing', 'Jack', 'Corrie', 'pony', 'cart', 'hurting', 'hand.She', 'piano', 'player', 'doctor', 'may', 'never', 'play', 'again.Ambolyn', 'family', 'return', 'home', 'Jack', 'returns', 'railroad', 'buries', 'work', 'refusing', 'touch', 'alcohol.A', 'tearful', 'Corrie', 'Grandfather', 'find', 'Dad', 'will', 'does.Jack', 'returns', 'home', 'only', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'front', 'gate.Ambolyn', 'finally', 'go', 'stubborness', 'strains', 'Jacks', 'favourite', 'song', 'Bill', 'Bailey', 'are', 'soon', 'emanating', 'household', 'piano', 'Jack', 'inside', 'happily', 'ever', 'reunion.Rarely', 'film', 'falter', 'only', 'then', 'try', 'further', 'plot.The', 'relationship', 'father', 'daughter', 'here', 'keystone', 'film', 'beautifully.Even', 'never', 'forget', 'who', 'playing', 'dad', 'are', 'alot', 'in-references', 'real', 'Gleason', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'better', 'choice', 'part.The', 'chemistry', 'little', 'Linda', 'Bruhl', 'Corrie', 'was', 'magical.Johns', 'hurt', 'frustrated', 'wife', 'tee', 'Laurel', 'Goodwin', 'Augusta', 'part', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'teenage', 'angst.To', 'top', 'everything', 'movie', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'best', 'song', 'year', 'Call', 'Me', 'Irrresponsible', '.Sung', 'Gleason', 'condition', 'tailors', 'headless', 'dummy', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'appreciated.One', 'Great', 'Ones', 'finest', 'screen', 'moments', 'Papa', 'Delicate', 'Condition', 'film', 'recommend', 'highly.It', 'presented', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'print', 'transfer', 'original', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1:78.It', 'good', 'wholesome', 'film', 'entire', 'family', ""'re"", 'made', 'wood', 'will', 'tug', 'mightily', 'heart', 'strings']",N/A
