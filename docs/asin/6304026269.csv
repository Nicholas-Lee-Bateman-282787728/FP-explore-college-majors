Jackie gives a good dramatic performance, though as it is basically his first, is not terrific.  Please note the 3 stars are for Jackie and the story, not for the DVD itself.  20 or so minutes (which explains why a lot of the action happens) have been cut from this version.  This is typical of US distributed Jackie movies I have found.  Check out Amazon.co.uk for recently produced DVDs (including this one) which are not cut.  They are PAL format though.  If you are a rabid Chan-fan, and like to see Jackie stretching himself a little beyond the typical action/comedy/stunt scenario then this movie is a must see and won't disappoint, even in its reduced format.",3,Good drama,1005868800,"11 16, 2001",2001,861,"['story', 'basically', 'good', 'drama', 'action/kung', 'fu', 'scenes', 'supporting', 'story', 'unusual', 'Lo', 'Wei', 'directed', 'Jackie', 'picture', 'Hong', 'Kong', '70s', 'kung', 'fu', 'genre', 'whole', 'Jackie', 'good', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'basically', 'first', 'not', 'terrific', 'Please', 'note', '3', 'stars', 'are', 'Jackie', 'story', 'not', 'DVD', '20', 'so', 'minutes', 'why', 'lot', 'action', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'version', 'typical', 'US', 'distributed', 'Jackie', 'movies', 'have', 'found', 'Check', 'out', 'Amazon.co.uk', 'recently', 'produced', 'DVDs', 'including', 'one', 'are', 'not', 'cut', 'are', 'PAL', 'format', 'are', 'rabid', 'Chan-fan', 'see', 'Jackie', 'stretching', 'little', 'typical', 'action/comedy/stunt', 'scenario', 'then', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'even', 'reduced', 'format']",N/A

396672,A3QFE1H3RUP6Z7,6304026269,"Shantell Powell ""The ShanMonster""","[2, 2]","Dragon Fist is a classic tale of redemption and butt-kicking.  Even if you've never seen a kungfu movie before, chances are, you'll be familiar with the storyline.  I don't want to give the story away, but realize it's the same sort of plot used in many westerns, only instead of cowpokes and gunfights, we have martial artists and kungfu showdowns.Dragon Fist is an early Jackie Chan drama.  It's a film he made before he created the genre of comedy chop sokki, and it shows not only can he do comedy, but he can also do a competent job at playing serious parts.My only real qualms about this flick are the dubbing (not bad, but not great, either) and the film quality.  The video and sound quality is particularly bad in the beginning fight sequence.  The kungfu masters all look about ten feet tall and four inches thick.  It's pretty stretched out.  In addition, the sound is very muffled, and I had to turn the volume up quite a way in order to understand what was being said.That being said, I do have one other nit-pick:  all the kungfu masters wear horrible, obvious wigs!  I was waiting for the hair to fly off during one of the many excellent fight choreographies, but it just didn't happen.

It looks like it came straight from a banged-up VHS tape.Not only that, but Beverly-Wilshire claims that this version is ""widescreen,"" but what they didn't tell you is that they took a full-screen version of ""Dragon Fist"" and then cut off the tops and bottoms of the screen to make it look like it's a ""widescreen"" picture.Here is what I would do. Buy the Columbia/Tristar version. Their version is cut by about 20 minutes from it's original version, but at least it has the original language and the movie in it's original 2:35:1 aspect ratio. That way, you can see the whole fight scenes without anything cut off on the sides of the screen. Then, to get the whole story, buy the Simitar version.
