424442,A1D6DFC3AGV3JZ,6304475101,Andrew Parodi,"[22, 24]","""Around no historical figure in modern times are there such complicated myths as those that exist around the figure of Eva, second wife of Juan Peron, best-known by the affectionate diminutive, Evita."" So begins the book EVITA: THE REAL LIFE OF EVA PERON. The author, Marysa Navarro, is interviewed in this video and adds, ""(Evita) was the woman who invented her own myth, and she was very good at it, because she was an actress, a radio actress. She knows how to pretend to be something other than what she is."" So the implication is clear, anyone hoping to remove the myths, and see the woman behind the myths, is going against Evita's wishes. And this is a formidable opponent. Evita was a genius. A genius that, unfortunately, this video (and none I have yet seen) cannot fully encompass.Robert D. Crassweller, in his book PERON AND THE ENIGMAS OF ARGENTINA, notes that, ""(Evita's) brief and dazzling years were so successful because, in good part, she was so profoundly of the ethos . . . but it was the ethos of the old Hispanic Creole tradition . . . (pp. 248)."" He further notes that, ""All Hispanic life seemed to be concentrated in a series of distant opposites held in very uneasy tension. The vastly rich and the totally poor; the highest of religious ideals and the lowest of conniving practices; unquestioning loyalty and foul treachery . . . a society of disjointed dualisms, lacking any continuum (pp. 27)."" The author argues that understanding this concept of extremes, so counter to Anglo-Saxon sensibilities, is key to understanding Hispanic culture. Since Evita lived in and embodied Hispanic culture, any biography of her that does not take this into account is doomed to fall short of an enlightened depiction of her. And that is what happens with this video.Don't get me wrong; this is an interesting video. What is most interesting about this video is the wide range of people who are interviewed, most of them authors, but a few friends and admirers. These include: a photographer from Evita's modeling days, film star Libertad Lamarque, Tomas Eloy Martinez (author of SANTA EVITA), Lillian Guardo (friend who accompanied Evita on her tour of Europe), historian Felix Luna, and Maria Elena Warner (resident of the ""Evita City"" housing district, which Evita founded). This wide range of commentators, some pro-Evita and some not, is wonderful. Unfortunately, no one is really given a very long time to talk. It really leaves you wanting more.Somewhat irritating is the fact that while this video succeeds in dispelling certain myths about Evita (such as the belief that she helped free Peron from jail in 1945, thus ushering him into his first presidential term), it reinforces others. The most notable re-told myths being: the idea that Evita had Libertad Lamarque ""blacklisted"" from working in Argentine cinema (""Libertad left Argentina for Mexico in 1946... Since the Mexican movie industry was in better shape . . . Libertad Lamarque's films were always shown in Argentina, and she came back frequently to see her family."" EVITA: THE REAL LIFE OF EVA PERON, pp. 202); the assertion that Peron was a fascist (""Peronism was not fascism. Some of Peronism's adherents had a fascist outlook and mentality . . . But all this was relatively superficial. No fascist society was ever erected on a mass base of laboring and dispossessed hordes. In its own description, Peronism rejected the Fascist parallel. It was more intimately grounded in the national history and ethos than was any European fascism."" PERON AND THE ENIGMAS OF ARGENTINA, pp. 220). Thus this video claims by its title to dispel myths, but it really just perpetuates some.Interesting and eerie is the fact that never-before-shown footage of Evita's embalmed corpse is included. Evita had been dead several decades at this point, and yet her corpse is perfectly preserved like Lenin's. Unsettling to the North American observer, such an attitude toward death could be seen in light of the ""Hispanic preoccupation with death and with the splendor and dignity associated with it (PERON AND THE ENIGMAS OF ARGENTINA, pp. 248)."" Again, this cultural distinction is not mentioned by the narrator.Not surprisingly, it is Madonna herself who seems to grasps the most important aspect of Evita's life and personality: the tradition of polarization. ""I became sort of obsessed with her,"" Madonna confesses in a very brief sound bite, ""People I talked to were either completely for her or completely against her. That fascinated me. I wondered, 'What's the truth in all this?'"" That 'is' the truth about Evita, that a polarized culture created polarized myths about a polarized woman. For some she is a saint, for others the devil. For those with no concept of the polarities of Hispanic culture, she is destined to be an enigma. Unfortunately, this documentary largely overlooks this vital ingredient.Most memorable about this video are the statements made my Antonio Cafiero, Peron's Minister of Commerce: ""When you put together the combination of being a woman, and being fanatic for a cause, you have an explosion the size of an atom bomb. THAT was Eva Peron."" The more gentle quote by Mr. Cafiero being, ""She is the symbol of the eternal struggle, the fight of the poor and disinherited who want more dignity in their lives. People don't forget that."" Indeed, this year marks the 50th anniversary of her death, and here I sit writing a review for a biography of her . . .",4,"Admirable attempt, impossible objective: Evita is all myth!",1018569600,"04

424443,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6304475101,Charles Ashbacher,"[11, 14]","Until very recently, the only way a woman could achieve political power was through a powerful man. In many of those cases, those who were able to do so accomplished their task via sexual means. Eva Peron (Evita) was such a woman. Born the illegitimate daughter of a poor woman, she was beautiful and ambitious. Combine this with a significant intelligence and the willingness to go through men until she found the one she wanted, and you have Evita. She finally managed to link up with the rising star of Juan Peron, although unlike some other political marriages, this one was based on a deep genuine affection.As you can see from the footage on this tape, Evita was glamorous and deeply loved by the majority of the Argentine people. She spent an enormous amount of time and energy in helping the poor, and she had no qualms about pressing the flesh with them. Even though she was advised not to touch people who were clearly very sick, she did not hesitate to hug them. In watching the tape, it is surprising to see her with an extremely elaborate hairdo, wearing expensive jewelry and clothing, yet being adored by people who would not earn the cost of her outfit in their entire lives.However, as was almost always the case in Central and South America in those times, Juan Peron's power was maintained through the military. It was only the combination of Evita's popularity with the poor and the strong arm of the military that Peron managed to stay in power. Once Evita died in her early thirties, his regime soon collapsed and he was forced to flee the country. Evita's saga after her death was bizarre. A Spanish pathologist spent years embalming her body and after Peron fell, the new Argentine rulers did not know what to do with it. They eventually shipped it to a falsely marked grave in Italy out of fear that it would be a shrine for Peron supporters. However, when Peron came back into favor, the body was returned and buried in a place of honor.Although she was clearly a second-rate actress, Evita Peron was the biggest female star on the Latin American stage during her time. She was an excellent combination of beauty, intelligence and charm, understanding public relations in a way that no other Latin leader did. This video captures all of that. You may not approve of how she rose to power, but you cannot deny that she wielded it well.",4,Beauty and intelligence made her powerful yet loved,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,2360,"['very', 'recently', 'only', 'way', 'woman', 'could', 'achieve', 'political', 'power', 'was', 'powerful', 'man', 'many', 'cases', 'who', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'accomplished', 'task', 'sexual', 'means', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'Evita', 'was', 'such', 'woman', 'illegitimate', 'daughter', 'poor', 'woman', 'was', 'beautiful', 'ambitious', 'Combine', 'significant', 'intelligence', 'willingness', 'go', 'men', 'found', 'one', 'wanted', 'have', 'Evita', 'finally', 'managed', 'link', 'up', 'rising', 'star', 'Juan', 'Peron', 'other', 'political', 'marriages', 'one', 'was', 'based', 'deep', 'genuine', 'can', 'see', 'footage', 'tape', 'Evita', 'was', 'glamorous', 'deeply', 'loved', 'majority', 'Argentine', 'people', 'spent', 'enormous', 'amount', 'time', 'energy', 'helping', 'poor', 'had', 'qualms', 'pressing', 'flesh', 'Even', 'was', 'advised', 'not', 'touch', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'clearly', 'very', 'sick', 'did', 'not', 'hesitate', 'hug', 'watching', 'tape', 'surprising', 'see', 'extremely', 'elaborate', 'hairdo', 'wearing', 'expensive', 'jewelry', 'clothing', 'yet', 'being', 'adored', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'earn', 'cost', 'outfit', 'entire', 'lives.However', 'was', 'almost', 'always', 'case', 'Central', 'South', 'America', 'times', 'Juan', 'Peron', 'power', 'was', 'maintained', 'military', 'was', 'only', 'combination', 'Evita', 'popularity', 'poor', 'strong', 'arm', 'military', 'Peron', 'managed', 'stay', 'power', 'Once', 'Evita', 'died', 'early', 'thirties', 'regime', 'soon', 'collapsed', 'was', 'forced', 'flee', 'country', 'Evita', 'saga', 'death', 'was', 'bizarre', 'Spanish', 'pathologist', 'spent', 'years', 'embalming', 'body', 'Peron', 'fell', 'new', 'Argentine', 'rulers', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'eventually', 'shipped', 'falsely', 'marked', 'grave', 'Italy', 'fear', 'would', 'be', 'shrine', 'Peron', 'supporters', 'However', 'when', 'Peron', 'came', 'back', 'favor', 'body', 'was', 'returned', 'buried', 'place', 'honor.Although', 'was', 'clearly', 'second-rate', 'actress', 'Evita', 'Peron', 'was', 'biggest', 'female', 'star', 'Latin', 'American', 'stage', 'time', 'was', 'excellent', 'combination', 'beauty', 'intelligence', 'charm', 'understanding', 'public', 'relations', 'way', 'other', 'Latin', 'leader', 'did', 'video', 'may', 'not', 'approve', 'how', 'rose', 'power', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'wielded', 'well']",Biography - Evita:  The Woman Behind the Myth VHS
424444,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,6304475101,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[9, 9]","I wished A&E; would have had a 90 minute biography segment of Eva Peron instead. Reason being is that there is so much this woman accomplished in such an incredibly short period of time and she aroused such fierce passions that even after her death, mentioning her name would have caused riots and conflicts. But since they didn't this 50 minute biography at least gives us a glimpse into the life of this woman who not only made a name for herself but also became one of the most powerful and controversial woman in history.This biography traces her meteoric rise from her humble beginnings to becoming one of the riches woman in the world. It includes several photographs and archival film footage. For the most part, the footage is pretty clear, especially during her Rainbow Tour sequence. She looks radiant, glamourous and beautiful. I wish they would have had more footage of her attending to the poor. Apparently there were news camera men with her at all times recording her at her desk or at her many public functions but in all of the documentaries, the same footage is always used. The same goes with the photographs. Being a collector of Eva Peron (I have over 100 books/magazines), I know there are hundreds of awesome photographs of the subject that they could have used but like the archival footage used, it's always the same photos. With that said, this documentary is still an interesting view. It offers some interesting pics of Eva during her years as an actress, revealing commentaries from historians and Eva Peron's friends and rivals, and some haunting photos of Eva's beautifully embalmed corpse in full colour. This is one of the most engrossing biography's in the series. Be warned however, that there is some mis-information and at times it's quite biased but for the most part, it quite factual.To get an overview of Eva Peron, the good and the bad, I also recommend the Lifetime biography Eva Peron and of course the film musical EVITA, althought the latter should be treated solely as entertainment and NOT as a history lesson since it's extremely inaccurate in places and alot falls under the category of fantasy.In his excellent book PERON AND THE ENIGMAS OF ARGENTINA,  Robert Crassweller wrote of her (after Eva dies):""Thus she passed from the scene...She was at once admitted to legend and indeed to sacred legend... Behind her she left an amazing amalgam of grief, guilt, mythology, celebration and despair as her friends and enemies sought to adjust to an Argentine world devoid of her central presence... Above all she left a huge space and no successor...And later on he would write:...""There would be no second Evita and no pretender to that eminence.""Love her or hate her, one cannot deny the mark Eva Maria Duarte de Peron left in the pages of Latin American history books. The woman was and is a star and her star still shines, just as it did over 50 years ago when she graced the world stage.",4,Not entirely accurate but it's still intriguing.,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,2937,"['wished', 'A', 'E', 'would', 'have', 'had', '90', 'minute', 'biography', 'segment', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'instead', 'Reason', 'being', 'so', 'much', 'woman', 'accomplished', 'such', 'incredibly', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'aroused', 'such', 'fierce', 'passions', 'even', 'death', 'mentioning', 'name', 'would', 'have', 'caused', 'riots', 'conflicts', 'did', ""n't"", '50', 'minute', 'biography', 'least', 'glimpse', 'life', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'made', 'name', 'herself', 'also', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'controversial', 'woman', 'history.This', 'biography', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'becoming', 'one', 'riches', 'woman', 'world', 'several', 'photographs', 'archival', 'film', 'footage', 'most', 'part', 'footage', 'pretty', 'clear', 'especially', 'Rainbow', 'Tour', 'sequence', 'radiant', 'glamourous', 'beautiful', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'footage', 'attending', 'poor', 'Apparently', 'were', 'news', 'camera', 'men', 'times', 'recording', 'desk', 'many', 'public', 'functions', 'documentaries', 'same', 'footage', 'always', 'used', 'same', 'photographs', 'Being', 'collector', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'have', 'over', '100', 'books/magazines', 'know', 'are', 'hundreds', 'awesome', 'photographs', 'subject', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'archival', 'footage', 'used', 'always', 'same', 'photos', 'said', 'documentary', 'still', 'interesting', 'view', 'interesting', 'pics', 'Eva', 'years', 'actress', 'revealing', 'commentaries', 'historians', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'friends', 'rivals', 'haunting', 'photos', 'Eva', 'beautifully', 'embalmed', 'corpse', 'full', 'colour', 'one', 'most', 'engrossing', 'biography', 'series', 'Be', 'warned', 'however', 'mis-information', 'times', 'quite', 'biased', 'most', 'part', 'quite', 'factual.To', 'get', 'overview', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'good', 'bad', 'also', 'recommend', 'Lifetime', 'biography', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'course', 'film', 'musical', 'EVITA', 'althought', 'latter', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'solely', 'entertainment', 'NOT', 'history', 'lesson', 'extremely', 'inaccurate', 'places', 'alot', 'falls', 'category', 'fantasy.In', 'excellent', 'book', 'PERON', 'THE', 'ENIGMAS', 'OF', 'ARGENTINA', 'Robert', 'Crassweller', 'wrote', 'Eva', 'passed', 'scene', 'was', 'once', 'admitted', 'legend', 'indeed', 'sacred', 'legend', 'left', 'amazing', 'amalgam', 'grief', 'guilt', 'mythology', 'celebration', 'despair', 'friends', 'enemies', 'sought', 'adjust', 'Argentine', 'world', 'devoid', 'central', 'presence', 'left', 'huge', 'space', 'successor', 'later', 'would', 'write', 'would', 'be', 'second', 'Evita', 'pretender', 'eminence', 'Love', 'hate', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'mark', 'Eva', 'Maria', 'Duarte', 'Peron', 'left', 'pages', 'Latin', 'American', 'history', 'books', 'woman', 'was', 'star', 'star', 'still', 'just', 'did', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'graced', 'world', 'stage']",Biography - Evita:  The Woman Behind the Myth VHS

After Santa Evita died in 1952 ... Madonna brought her back to life in 1997.Eva Peron was an out-of-wedlock teenager who took the train into Buenos Aires. She went from third rate actress to First Lady. From the day she died she was embalmed and immortalized. An icon Patron Saint of Ambition played by an icon herself (Madonna) years later. This is an honest account of a woman's who had so many demons they influenced Argentine social policy during her reign.Santa Evita to the poor who adored her. A wicked witch opportunist to the rich. Only Madonna, another Patron Saint of Ambition, could play Evita on the silver screen. Both lead parallel lives ... fatherless 15-year-old daughter who ran to the big city (Buenos Aires) just like a motherless girl who hopped a place to New York at 17. Both women ran off to follow their dreams despite parental concerns. Both politically savvy, ruthless ambition, and a fire in the belly that only fame would satisfy. The similarities continue as you watch this biopic:Eva started out an actress and became a political force to be reckoned with/Madonna was a dancer who turned to singingBoth were on the cover of Time at 26Eva was the most powerful woman in South America at 26. Madonna the most powerful recording artist at the same ageTeenage Eva lived in pension rooms in boarding houses living off coffee before becoming First Lady of Argentina. Street urchin Madonna crashed at various friends' places before become the reigning Queen of PopBoth looked stunning in designer gowns by French haute couture houses in ParisBoth inspire love or hate, no middle groundBoth very misunderstood since a powerful woman who is attractive is more threatening than any alpha male around to both gendersBoth did not return to their home towns until they made something of themselves in a big big way - Eva from the balconey of the Casa Rosada, Madonna from the world stages of New York,London, Paris, etcBoth were brunettes who found fame with bottle blonde hairAnd finally ...both epitomize the lines in one of the musicals songs: You were just a backstreet girl, hustling and fighting, scratching and biting, High Flying Adored, Did you Believe in your wildest moments - all this would be yours?
