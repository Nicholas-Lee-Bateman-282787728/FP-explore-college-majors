OK, maybe James Randi and Richard Dawkins doesn't, but I do. We also have our anti-favourites, alternative ""theories"" we consider pure, utter and unmitigated bunk. Well, at least I do!The ""Ancient Aliens"" episode ""Aliens and Bigfoot"" combined the best and the worst as far as I'm concerned. I want to believe in Jeff Meldrum and his claims about the squatch being a real, flesh-and-blood animal.

Hilarious nonsense!Yet, here they come...""Aliens and Bigfoot"" is a veritable extravaganza of the good, the bad and the really ugly.

One of the talking heads actually looks like an alien! He would certainly scare me on a UFO convention, LOL.The speculations are, of course, wild. Pun intended. Are the Bigfeet or Wildmen products of alien genetic engineering? Are they alien-human hybrids? Was Goliath an alien? You know, the guy who fought with David. Or are *we* the products of alien genetic engineering? Perhaps the aliens inserted their DNA in some captured Bigfoot, thereby creating us? Or are the smelly squatches aliens themselves, living in underground caverns to avoid detection while on Earth?Ha ha ha. Yeah, sure. An entirely alien race from Zeta Ridiculous has DNA compatible with that of earthling primates...Another funny speculation: the Egyptian gods must be the result of genetic engineering by mad scientists, since they look like crosses between humans and various animals. Geezus, don't these guys know it's a shamanic thing?! I'm sure somebody can give the producers of ""Ancient Aliens"" some illicit, psychedelic substance &aacute; la Aldous Huxley or Huston Smith.

1575447,A78S48N9U3IT7,B008SBXFNM,Bernie,"[1, 2]","I've watched each season of &#34;Ancient Aliens&#34; repeatedly. I love this stuff.To say that the content is speculative is a massive understatement. Aliens are everywhere. Basically if you flip over a rock in an exotic locale, you'll find an alien under it. Except that sometimes you won't. That's my favorite thing about this show. About ninety-nine percent of the time, the cast of &#34;ancient alien theorists&#34; attribute everything to aliens. The remaining five percent consists of Giorgio declaring that one theory or another is as crazy as his hair, only to replace it with an even crazier theory. &#34;Did aliens construct Mount Everest out of recycled beer cans? No. Of course not. That's ridiculous. But did they use Mount Everest as a fortress from which to monitor humans below? Absolutely.&#34;Ever since I discovered a battered old paperback of &#34;Chariots of the Gods&#34; in the library when I was a child, I've been fascinated by things such as the Nazca lines, the Bermuda Triangle, Stonehenge, Easter Island, etc. I've heard plenty of prosaic explanations for all of those things -- and I tend to believe those explanations -- but von Daaniken and &#34;Ancient Aliens&#34; provide vastly more entertaining explanations. Unbelievable ones, to be sure, but fascinating ones.It's fun to listen to the narrator carefully avoid any definitive statements, instead casting things in the form of questions or attributing beliefs to unnamed theorists, but in a way I think these shows are great for exposing people to a larger vision of the world and to different belief systems. I don't accept &#34;Ancient Aliens'&#34; explanations at face value, but the show has informed me about places I didn't know existed. Some of these places up in the mountains of Peru or in the Middle East or wherever are incredibly cool with incredibly interesting oral histories. I wouldn't have stumbled upon those locations on my own; this show led me to them.So I don't believe the theories put forth on the show. But I love the show, because speculation is a fun mental exercise and because I've learned new things from it. Frankly, how much crazier is it to believe in ancient aliens than it is to believe in God or Allah or Buddha? Not much. Maybe it's not even as crazy as those other beliefs.",4,I love this stuff.,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,2297,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'season', '34', 'Ancient', 'Aliens', '34', 'repeatedly', 'love', 'stuff.To', 'say', 'content', 'speculative', 'massive', 'understatement', 'Aliens', 'are', 'everywhere', 'Basically', 'flip', 'rock', 'exotic', 'locale', ""'ll"", 'find', 'alien', 'wo', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'thing', 'show', 'ninety-nine', 'percent', 'time', 'cast', '34', 'ancient', 'alien', 'theorists', '34', 'attribute', 'everything', 'aliens', 'remaining', 'five', 'percent', 'consists', 'Giorgio', 'declaring', 'one', 'theory', 'as', 'crazy', 'hair', 'only', 'replace', 'even', 'crazier', 'theory', '34', 'Did', 'construct', 'Mount', 'Everest', 'recycled', 'beer', 'cans', 'course', 'not', 'ridiculous', 'did', 'use', 'Mount', 'Everest', 'fortress', 'monitor', 'humans', 'Absolutely.', '34', 'Ever', 'discovered', 'battered', 'old', 'paperback', '34', 'Chariots', 'Gods', '34', 'library', 'when', 'was', 'child', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fascinated', 'things', 'such', 'Nazca', 'lines', 'Bermuda', 'Triangle', 'Stonehenge', 'Easter', 'Island', 'etc', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'plenty', 'prosaic', 'explanations', 'things', 'tend', 'believe', 'explanations', 'von', 'Daaniken', '34', 'Ancient', 'Aliens', '34', 'provide', 'vastly', 'more', 'entertaining', 'explanations', 'Unbelievable', 'ones', 'be', 'sure', 'fascinating', 'fun', 'listen', 'narrator', 'carefully', 'definitive', 'statements', 'instead', 'casting', 'things', 'form', 'questions', 'attributing', 'beliefs', 'unnamed', 'theorists', 'way', 'think', 'shows', 'are', 'great', 'exposing', 'people', 'larger', 'vision', 'world', 'different', 'belief', 'systems', 'do', ""n't"", 'accept', '34', 'Ancient', 'Aliens', '34', 'explanations', 'face', 'value', 'show', 'informed', 'places', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'existed', 'places', 'up', 'mountains', 'Peru', 'Middle', 'East', 'are', 'incredibly', 'cool', 'incredibly', 'interesting', 'oral', 'histories', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'stumbled', 'locations', 'own', 'show', 'led', 'them.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'theories', 'put', 'forth', 'show', 'love', 'show', 'speculation', 'fun', 'mental', 'exercise', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'new', 'things', 'Frankly', 'how', 'much', 'crazier', 'believe', 'ancient', 'aliens', 'believe', 'God', 'Allah', 'Buddha', 'Not', 'much', 'Maybe', 'not', 'even', 'as', 'crazy', 'other', 'beliefs']",Ancient Aliens: Season 4

This series is a vindication of the ideas that were presented in Erich von Daniken's landmark book, ""The Chariot of the Gods"".  Now in its fifth season, the show continues to fascinate and to educate.  Each episode takes the reader on a virtual globe-hopping trip to some of the most fascinating and the most mysterious sites.  The third season went over the edge with its ideas, but this fourth season is back on track with the show's original themes.  In this particular episode, the topic is Puma Punku.Puma Punku has been mentioned on the show numerous times in the past.  But this episode is dedicated to the site and really tackles the mysteries in greater depth.  What I enjoyed most about this episode is Christopher Dunn's theory on the purpose of the stone artifacts.  He theorizes that these precisely-made stone devices were in fact elaborate door hinges.  It's really refreshing to have someone other than an archeologists present their ideas on these topics.  A skilled machinists like Dunn will have his unique perspective on these objects.  And the theory that he presents is just as valid as any other.  Dunn is one of the more interesting experts on the show.

How can one say such a contradictory thing? Well, it's fun to laugh at when I have no other pressing business. This is a subject TV never tires of using to steamroller the audience. Some of this hypothesizing goes back to the 1970s. ""Ancient Aliens"" itself as a concept for a series goes back to the mid-1990s and they did one in 2004 or 2005.I do not need to explain too strenuously that the series is about a bunch of fools - people who truly think our earth was visited by extraterrestrials, who seeded life here, gave us all our good ideas and tools. Some of these people go so far as to say Einstein and Tesla were probably aliens. They truly believe what they spew. Naturally, the goal of the series has become simple: tie aliens to EVERYTHING, from Bigfoot to the Founding Fathers.So you have on this series repeat offenders such as the tirelessly goofy David Childress and the annoyingly presumptuous Giorgio Tsoukalos (who sounds to me like he's faking a vaguely Euro-stylish accent, but only because I have heard him speak perfectly normal ""rural New York""-sounding English).Let me tell you, the way these people speak is so irritating that Gandhi and Mother Teresa would have ganged up on them to strangle them. There is a particularly persistent individual on this show, named Jason Martel, I believe (I may be mistaken about his 1st name), who must be one of the dumbest people on the planet since he can barely navigate the rules of speaking English and he's not a foreigner. Some experts!Von Daniken, in my estimation, really stepped down into the muck to appear in these episodes. On occasion there are real experts, but I question what they're doing on this dumb program. I'm as game as anybody for a nice whack-a-doodle ""theory"" once in a while, but a show that has the narrator saying ""as ancient astronaut theorists believe"" literally every other sentence is nothing more than bad propaganda. Actually, this repetitious disclaimer got so bad that in 2013, I noticed about a 45% reduction in its utterance.Naturally the show is wonderful for seeing the many places they visit - and I do often watch reruns with the sound off for that purpose. I can't stand hearing nothing but ""aliens built this"" over and over and over. Yet the sites they visit are terribly controversial as to age. These guys always say the sites predate Adam, as if they had known him personally and he assured them of it. Well, I look in the mirror a lot, I like to think I'm way younger, yet I look and feel I may be far older. But I never think aliens made me.So much for hypotheses! 2 stars only because I have to give it at least 1 star and the other is for the locations.",2,As ancient Amazon reviewers believe!,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,2783,"['ANCIENT', 'ALIENS', 'History', 'Channel', 'H2', 'TV', 'series', '2009', 'date', '5', 'seasons', 'so', 'far', 'one', 'angering', 'hoot', 'program', 'How', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'such', 'contradictory', 'thing', 'Well', 'fun', 'laugh', 'when', 'have', 'other', 'pressing', 'business', 'subject', 'TV', 'never', 'tires', 'using', 'steamroller', 'audience', 'hypothesizing', 'back', '1970s', 'Ancient', 'Aliens', 'concept', 'series', 'back', 'mid-1990s', 'did', 'one', '2004', '2005.I', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'explain', 'too', 'strenuously', 'series', 'bunch', 'fools', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'think', 'earth', 'was', 'visited', 'extraterrestrials', 'who', 'seeded', 'life', 'here', 'gave', 'good', 'ideas', 'tools', 'people', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'Einstein', 'Tesla', 'were', 'probably', 'aliens', 'truly', 'believe', 'what', 'spew', 'Naturally', 'goal', 'series', 'become', 'simple', 'tie', 'aliens', 'EVERYTHING', 'Bigfoot', 'Founding', 'Fathers.So', 'have', 'series', 'repeat', 'offenders', 'such', 'tirelessly', 'David', 'Childress', 'annoyingly', 'presumptuous', 'Giorgio', 'Tsoukalos', 'who', 'faking', 'vaguely', 'Euro-stylish', 'accent', 'only', 'have', 'heard', 'speak', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'rural', 'New', 'York', '-sounding', 'English', '.Let', 'tell', 'way', 'people', 'speak', 'so', 'irritating', 'Gandhi', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'would', 'have', 'ganged', 'up', 'strangle', 'particularly', 'persistent', 'individual', 'show', 'named', 'Jason', 'Martel', 'believe', 'may', 'be', 'mistaken', '1st', 'name', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'dumbest', 'people', 'planet', 'can', 'barely', 'navigate', 'rules', 'speaking', 'English', 'not', 'foreigner', 'experts', 'Von', 'Daniken', 'estimation', 'really', 'stepped', 'down', 'muck', 'appear', 'episodes', 'occasion', 'are', 'real', 'experts', 'question', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'dumb', 'program', ""'m"", 'as', 'game', 'anybody', 'nice', 'whack-a-doodle', 'theory', 'once', 'while', 'show', 'narrator', 'saying', 'ancient', 'astronaut', 'theorists', 'believe', 'literally', 'other', 'sentence', 'nothing', 'more', 'bad', 'propaganda', 'Actually', 'repetitious', 'disclaimer', 'got', 'so', 'bad', '2013', 'noticed', '45', '%', 'reduction', 'utterance.Naturally', 'show', 'wonderful', 'seeing', 'many', 'places', 'visit', 'do', 'often', 'watch', 'reruns', 'sound', 'purpose', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'hearing', 'nothing', 'aliens', 'built', 'over', 'sites', 'visit', 'are', 'terribly', 'controversial', 'age', 'guys', 'always', 'say', 'sites', 'predate', 'Adam', 'had', 'known', 'personally', 'assured', 'Well', 'look', 'mirror', 'lot', 'like', 'think', ""'m"", 'way', 'younger', 'look', 'feel', 'may', 'be', 'far', 'older', 'never', 'think', 'aliens', 'made', 'me.So', 'much', 'hypotheses', '2', 'stars', 'only', 'have', 'give', 'least', '1', 'star', 'other', 'locations']",Ancient Aliens: Season 4

In speaking about ancient Egyptian batteries and electric lamps, there is no question those things existed.  Rather, I think this series is a bit insulting to simply assume we the human race required intervention from aliens.  We are a curious lot.  And given enough people trying different things to understand their world (and/or to survive or offer a good /service to have a role in society), I posit it is inevitable that we discovered electricity.For example, imagine you have an ancient Egyptian woman preparing a feast for 1000 people.  She's one of a group of chefs preparing this meal. This woman is responsible for the juicing of lemons.  It's all she does for an afternoon.  After a time, she's got a terracotta urn filled with lemon juice for the hundreds of pounds of falafel dough or whatever.  As shes stirring it up, she dips her arms into the lemon juice and gets a mild shock.  On one arm, she has a bangle made of copper, on the other arm a bangle made of silver and zinc, creating a dielectric.  Not only is this scenario likely, it's inevitable.  I'm sure you've experienced the same thing with putting a gum wrapper in your mouth and having a zing from your mercury amalgam filling.It's inevitable that we discovered electricity.  Ancient people were more or less the same people we have today because evolution doesn't work that quickly.  If you can say anything it's that culture has evolved and now we are sufficiently advanced to understand exactly that we don't really know much about the past but at least we're on the court, playing the game of catch-up.",5,Great show that's a bit insulting to the intellect and curiousity of man.,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,1692,"['34', 'real', 'question', 'where', 'did', 'get', 'knowledge', '34', 'got', 'knowledge', 'curiousity', 'speaking', 'ancient', 'Egyptian', 'batteries', 'electric', 'lamps', 'question', 'things', 'existed', 'Rather', 'think', 'series', 'bit', 'insulting', 'simply', 'assume', 'human', 'race', 'required', 'intervention', 'aliens', 'are', 'curious', 'lot', 'given', 'enough', 'people', 'trying', 'different', 'things', 'understand', 'world', 'and/or', 'survive', 'offer', 'good', '/service', 'have', 'role', 'society', 'posit', 'inevitable', 'discovered', 'electricity.For', 'example', 'imagine', 'have', 'ancient', 'Egyptian', 'woman', 'preparing', 'feast', '1000', 'people', 'one', 'group', 'chefs', 'preparing', 'meal', 'woman', 'responsible', 'juicing', 'lemons', 'afternoon', 'time', 'got', 'terracotta', 'urn', 'filled', 'lemon', 'juice', 'hundreds', 'pounds', 'falafel', 'dough', 'shes', 'stirring', 'up', 'arms', 'lemon', 'juice', 'mild', 'shock', 'one', 'arm', 'bangle', 'made', 'copper', 'other', 'arm', 'bangle', 'made', 'silver', 'zinc', 'creating', 'dielectric', 'Not', 'only', 'scenario', 'likely', 'inevitable', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'same', 'thing', 'putting', 'gum', 'wrapper', 'mouth', 'having', 'zing', 'mercury', 'filling.It', 'inevitable', 'discovered', 'electricity', 'Ancient', 'people', 'were', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'people', 'have', 'today', 'evolution', ""n't"", 'work', 'quickly', 'can', 'say', 'anything', 'culture', 'evolved', 'now', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'advanced', 'understand', 'exactly', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'much', 'past', 'least', ""'re"", 'court', 'playing', 'game', 'catch-up']",Ancient Aliens: Season 4

1575520,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008SBXFNM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[45, 53]","First and foremost, History Channel's ""Ancient Aliens"" is an entertainment program and if you have an interest in the topic (whether or not you believe it), it can be a fun show. Just look at the episode titles if you are on the fence about how seriously you want to take this as science or history. Aliens really can't be responsible for everything that has ever happened on Earth, can they?  Tales of mysterious and unexplained phenomenon, folklore and legend, and intergalactic speculation cross all international boundaries and are an inherent part of ancient history and cultural iconography. And as this documentary series began in its first season, it did a good job acknowledging the various interpretations of alien myths across the globe. However, the more we progress--the theories and/or premises behind the show have become a little thinner, a little more hit or miss. I suppose that was to be expected as the program has already delved into the biggest, most well known, and most supported mysteries in earlier seasons. Thus, later seasons (while always entertaining) have had their equal share of fascinating speculation intertwined with engaging historical insights AND with episodes of eye-rolling lunacy.And I think that is exactly how I might describe Season Four's new episodes.  But let's face the honest truth.  If you are shopping for Season Four of ""Ancient Aliens,"" I don't think you need much convincing about whether you like the program or not.  For my money, these episodes (although still somewhat hit or miss) have a stronger overall impact than Season Three where some of the topics were pretty funny.  The show still has some repetition in principle themes.  Here, again, we see focus drawn to the Mayans, the pyramids, to Doomsday, to time travel and to various cover-up theories.  All of these topics have been well covered in alien mythology for years and by this show in general.  They try to take different angles, but it doesn't change the fact that you've probably sat through similar programming in the past!The ten episodes presented of Season Four are spread across two Blu-ray discs with no bonus features for approximately 7 hours and 20 minutes of programming.  I'm not sure what happened because by my count, Season Four actually has several more episodes that were delayed until later this year for broadcast but were originally counted among Season Four titles (among them are Secrets of the Pyramids, Aliens and Cover-Ups, Aliens and Electricity, the Einstein Factor, and Destination Orion). It seems they are slated to return to TV in December.  There are English and Spanish subtitle options available as well.These are the included episodes: (1) The Mayan Conspiracy, (2) The Doomsday Prophecies, (3) The Greys, (4) Aliens and Mega-Disasters, (5) The NASA Connection, (6) Mystery of Puma Punku, (7) Aliens and Bigfoot, (8) The Da Vinci Conspiracy, (9) The Time Travelers, and (10) Aliens and Dinosaurs.Personally, I could live the rest of my life without any more speculation of Da Vinci and I've grown weary of the Mayan topic.  But the Greys and Puma Punku episodes caught my interest, while Mega-disasters and Bigfoot were silly enough and amusing.  Again, as entertainment, ""Ancient Aliens"" continues to work.  As science and/or history--I'll leave how effective it meets these criteria for you.

I don't see why there's so many ridiculous reviews from people. It's like people believe one thing but not another, which is human nature. But when evidence is put in your face, you can not refute that. I wouldn't say I believe, but I won't say I am not open to the possibilities. There are far too many outlandish things out there the half of the world truly believes. I am not one of those mainstream people who play follow the leader just to be in the loop.
