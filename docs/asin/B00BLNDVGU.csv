The acting is first rate, the storyline keeps you interested, the characters well developed so you can't help but relate to some of the craziest things they come up with (stopping short of killing someone ofc).  Her portrayal of Mary pulls you in, gets you in her head so you can totally relate to some of the emotions behind the things she does. I actually came across this movie when I was searching Netflix for the first two in the American Psycho films, after watching it three times in the same week, I knew I had to own it, American Mary is now on the list of my top ten favorite movies of all time.

1635414,A2AFBVM5O9R09V,B00BLNDVGU,"Arish ""A+""","[1, 1]",I personally love this movie for its realness and boldness. Its basically a story of how a young reclusive woman who once had hopes and dreams gets disappointed. The story starts off with Mary Mason a medical student having financial issues and noone to turn too. The thing that I really love about the character is how she is portrayed as a independent soul. Mary doesn't need the validation of people she doesn't have a boyfriend she mainly spends her time alone. In the long haul she finds out that the people she looked up too in the medical field were not what she thought they were. There was a series  of life turning events that led up to the one event that finally changed her as a person. Soon after she was sucked into a world of debachery.American Mary is a realistic portrayal of how people can be judged by there appearance. It is also a good character study and shows that corporate people are hypocrites. They are just as weird and unhinged and strange as the people they judge. Mary had found a new family in the freaks which were very honest and in her corner throughout the film. Unlike the people she worshipped in the beginning and once admired. So as the story progresses she becomes more bitter and numb as time went on. There is one particular scene where you can see that she had held lot in and finally exploded. From the point after someone close to her died she became even more unconcerned about wrong or right. The film isn't really a hardcore gore fest or horrorfilm which I admire its uniqueness. But yet its a realistic portrayal of just how fed up someone could get with life and strike out on their own. The only other film I have seen similiar to this in originality was EXCISION.This is definitley worth the purchase if your looking for a different type of film with a good soundtrack. The cinematography is good the acting is ok. But over all a very unique and enjoyable experience. If you want to hear an amazing song from the sountrack check out BOSS & SWAN Raging Bull. The only issue I really had with the film was the ending credits song. I didn't think it was a good contrast with the ending of the film. I think it could have went for something slower and more emotional. Other than that this is a good film I advise to view it on Bluray to get the full effect. The story means the world to me because I am one of those people that don't need people to validate me. I am also to aloner not by choice just because I haven't found the right person to share my interest with. I also work in a corporate enviroment to make ends meet and noone understands me. When I go out on occassion it is amazing to be around people who aren't such hypocrites. Life does harden you over time and you become numb to other people. But this is definitley a extreme case in the film. This is a great film if you are one of those people and totally understand the contrast between light to darkness. It's a good character study for those who have really experienced life and had to take on life as it was handed to them.If you like this then check out :ShameGirls against boysKiss of the DamnedPassionBreaking the GirlsStokerThe lifeguardByzantiumAlbatrossNobody WalksLovelaceDisconnectThe EastExcisionOnly God Forgives ( Takes Patience not like DRIVE),5,A very UniQuE ExpErieNCe :),1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,3275,"['personally', 'love', 'movie', 'realness', 'boldness', 'basically', 'story', 'how', 'young', 'reclusive', 'woman', 'who', 'once', 'had', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'disappointed', 'story', 'Mary', 'Mason', 'medical', 'student', 'having', 'financial', 'issues', 'noone', 'turn', 'too', 'thing', 'really', 'love', 'character', 'how', 'portrayed', 'independent', 'soul', 'Mary', ""n't"", 'need', 'validation', 'people', ""n't"", 'have', 'boyfriend', 'mainly', 'time', 'alone', 'long', 'haul', 'out', 'people', 'looked', 'up', 'too', 'medical', 'field', 'were', 'not', 'what', 'thought', 'were', 'was', 'series', 'life', 'turning', 'events', 'led', 'up', 'one', 'event', 'finally', 'changed', 'person', 'Soon', 'was', 'sucked', 'world', 'debachery.American', 'Mary', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'judged', 'appearance', 'also', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'corporate', 'people', 'are', 'hypocrites', 'are', 'just', 'weird', 'unhinged', 'strange', 'people', 'judge', 'Mary', 'had', 'found', 'new', 'family', 'freaks', 'were', 'very', 'honest', 'corner', 'film', 'people', 'worshipped', 'beginning', 'once', 'admired', 'So', 'story', 'more', 'bitter', 'numb', 'time', 'went', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'had', 'held', 'lot', 'finally', 'exploded', 'point', 'someone', 'close', 'died', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'unconcerned', 'wrong', 'right', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'hardcore', 'gore', 'fest', 'horrorfilm', 'admire', 'uniqueness', 'yet', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'just', 'how', 'fed', 'up', 'someone', 'could', 'get', 'life', 'strike', 'out', 'own', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'similiar', 'originality', 'was', 'EXCISION.This', 'definitley', 'purchase', 'looking', 'different', 'type', 'film', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'cinematography', 'good', 'acting', 'ok', 'very', 'unique', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'want', 'hear', 'amazing', 'song', 'sountrack', 'check', 'BOSS', 'SWAN', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'only', 'issue', 'really', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'ending', 'credits', 'song', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'good', 'contrast', 'ending', 'film', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'went', 'something', 'slower', 'more', 'emotional', 'Other', 'good', 'film', 'advise', 'view', 'Bluray', 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'story', 'world', 'am', 'one', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'people', 'validate', 'am', 'also', 'aloner', 'not', 'choice', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'right', 'person', 'share', 'interest', 'also', 'work', 'corporate', 'enviroment', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'noone', 'understands', 'When', 'go', 'out', 'occassion', 'amazing', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'such', 'hypocrites', 'Life', 'harden', 'time', 'become', 'numb', 'other', 'people', 'extreme', 'case', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'are', 'one', 'people', 'totally', 'understand', 'contrast', 'light', 'darkness', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'who', 'have', 'really', 'experienced', 'life', 'had', 'take', 'life', 'was', 'handed', 'them.If', 'then', 'out', 'ShameGirls', 'boysKiss', 'DamnedPassionBreaking', 'GirlsStokerThe', 'lifeguardByzantiumAlbatrossNobody', 'WalksLovelaceDisconnectThe', 'EastExcisionOnly', 'God', 'Forgives', 'Takes', 'Patience', 'not', 'DRIVE']",N/A

Jen and Sylvia Soska return with their second highly-acclaimed Horror film entitled AMERICAN MARY, from 2012. Katherine Isabelle is an absolute knock-out as the sinful surgeon, lending a whole new meaning to the phrase ""Desperate times call for desperate measures"" with her peculiar new career path. MARY is teeming with dark, sadistic humor and sharply-written dialog, each of which are played out perfectly through Isabelle's twisted performance. Todd Masters lends a number of stomach-churning effects to the picture, as well. Although MARY takes us in to daring new territory as we delve in to the rarely-seen world of body modification, its message seems lost somewhere along the way. Having already earned her revenge, Mary's motives become increasingly unclear as she continues on with her bloody business towards no certain end.

Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[1, 3]","""American Mary"" is about a young female medical student (Katherine Isabel) who turns to a world of body modification surgery in order to pay her way through medical school. The movie turns too bizarre right around the middle, and as a result, it fails because of a lack of character development.In some ways this film is similar to ""Excision"" because is has a strong female lead and focuses the majority of its running time on a bizarre fixation with surgery. ""Excision"" was a success because the audience was able to connect with its lead characters. This film, however, takes a look at the underground world of plastic and cosmetic surgery, and it would all have been spectacular if the viewer was able to maintain any type of emotional connection to any of the film's stars. The cast does a good job, but the script is lacking, and at times, random characters who have nothing to do with the plot are introduced and their actions are often unexplained. As a horror film goes, this is better than most of what's out there, especially in the acting and production department.

1635423,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00BLNDVGU,C. Sawin,"[2, 4]","Mary Mason (Katharine Isabelle) is going to medical school to be a surgeon, but she's also incredibly broke. Desperate for money, Mary interviews at a strip club run by sex hungry owner Billy Barker (Antonio Cupo) but is pulled into doing some rather unorthodox underground surgery for a few grand. Now with her name making the rounds, a strange woman named Beatress Johnson (Tristan Risk) consistently contacting Mary for work, and male surgeons inviting her to bizarre get-togethers, Mary's life begins to take a different yet morbid turn albeit a more financially successful one.It seems almost shameful to compare ""American Mary"" to ""Nip/Tuck"" since ""Nip/Tuck"" was more about cosmetic surgery where things were added to someone's body and ""American Mary"" is more about body modification and altering what's already there to make a statement about yourself, but that contrast is the first thing that comes to mind especially once Ruby Realgirl (Paula Lindberg) and her desire to be doll-like are introduced.The film triumphs in the characters it introduces more than anything else. Nearly every character has his or her own unique traits to be distinguished from the rest. Mary is obviously the film's crowning jewel and has the most layers. She doesn't necessarily show a lot of emotion, but the evolution of her character is an absolute beast. It's fascinating to see how male characters like Billy, Dr. Grant (David Lovgren), and Detective Dolor (John Emmet Tracy) can be so different from one another or that Beatress and Ruby seem rather kindhearted by nature while the twins (Jen and Sylvia Soska) are more devious.You may be expecting ""American Mary"" to be really offensive and obnoxious with all of the gore being shoved into the camera and practically into the lap of the viewer, but it's actually pretty understated. The film doesn't shy away from blood, but the really disgusting moments (and there are at least a handful) aren't shown on screen, highlight the victim's screams more than anything else, and leave most of the gore to your imagination. It's that old school approach of verbally explaining what's going to be done and then the camera cutting away while you hear muffled screams. Penis Guy and Ruby's downtown surgery is about as graphic as it gets.The ending doesn't feel very gratifying, but you can look at it a few different ways. On one hand, it feels a bit rushed. On the other, it's as if everything is coming full circle and is happening as an alternative to the ending you may be expecting.In a certain light, ""American Mary"" is similar to ""The Human Centipede"" in the sense that the concept is rather horrifying, but the film itself isn't as overly graphic as you may think. Watching Mary's unpleasant journey is intriguing and each character having identifiable quirks is a strong point, but unfortunately ""American Mary"" isn't really anything all that special otherwise.

As a spoiler free primer, Mary is a med student who drops out of school and performs illegal surgeries for the body mod community.  Although she is violating medical ethics, as an unlicensed practitioner, she's providing a service who's patrons would otherwise have little access to---and at a high quality level.  It sounds like a great premise for a late night cable drama right?  Most films don't attempt this kind of complex layered conflict.  It is the mark of great upcoming horror twin auteurs, Jen and Sylvia Soska.With such a well developed core conflict, American Mary's major flaw is how it unravels at the end.  In order to make a this a film sized project, and not a miniseries sized one, the Sisters cut off Mary's story with a flimsy, undercooked villain.  They do maintain a strong core theme however, linking body modification to misogyny and female objectification.

After suddenly losing her job, and having her phone shut off, Mary goes to a strip / s&m; club to earn some extra money.  She shows up with a resume (mentioning her medical background) and auditions for a job. While auditioning for the club owner, a bouncer comes in and says there is a problem. Someone got a little carried away with torture, and a man is dying.  Mary is asked to do emergency surgery to save the man's life, and earns enough cash to pay her bills in the process.  The next day, one of the dancers contacts Mary with an offer of another job.  Soon Mary starts making a lot of money performing underground body modification surgeries.  Just when it seems everything is going well for her, she is betrayed and humiliated by some ranking surgeons from her college after being invited to one of their parties.  Mary uses her contacts from the club to exact some well deserved revenge and further her modification skills.  Up until this point, this is a tightly paced, well written revenge thriller, that keeps you rooting for the heroine and on the edge of your seat.Then, the directors show up for an awful, extended cameo that stops the movie dead in it's tracks.  Their horrible 'acting' and worse accents just completely derail  the movie and it never really recovers.  It's a totally unnecessary 'look at us' moment that goes on way too long.

1635429,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,B00BLNDVGU,Dwight,"[1, 5]","This film caught my attention when Katherine Isabelle's Nana used the word, ""Korvah!""  Whooo!  Haha.  I also really enjoyed that Amazon's product page contains the (relevant?) information that Katherine Isabelle staunchly refuses to do nude scenes which really jibes with the strength and will of her portrayal in this film.  I wasn't going to watch this film at all but I was curious to see how the girl in Ginger Snaps had turned out.  I think that she turned out in what the main character in American Psycho 2 tried but failed to convey - that quarter life period in a smart but not silver spooned young woman's life when you have an iPhone that you cannot afford along with other essentials for your happiness.This movie is full o shocking and exotic details like Tristan Risk's modified face.  Ultimately, this is a tragedy and a thwarted life but conveyed as some adventure in a girl's life for the voyeuristic audience - and that is exactly what Buffy the Vampire Slayer is - seven years of a promising young girl's life damaged and wasted, really destroyed because she was beseiged by monsters.American Mary on the other hand is a profiteer in this world with ignorance/amnesia about the fact that the voluntary body modification patients are requesting the same surgeries as Josef Mengele forced upon his victims.  The director sisters actually appear as twins with laces in their backs evoking Mengele's siamese twin experiments as well as requesting that their left arms be switched with one another.  You can see that these walking wounded with their sad alterations especially sweet-voiced but perhaps malevolent-intentioned Beatress show the audience what Mengele's victims looked like.  One ""customer"" has a star tattooed in the same place that Auschwitz's Comfort Women had ""feld hure"" tattooed on their chest.This movie is about how American Mary is constantly blocked by aggressive males and Katherine Isabelle is perfectly cast because she really comes off like those girls in college with no sense of entitlement but working hard to reach their full potential.  Hopefully, the reality at least in North America, is that American Marys make it - they don't have this happen to them because a real American girl would be on those Orgy Doctors SO FAST - she'd be on CNN and the Today Show within the same half hour.  Definitely, unbelievable and unlikely is that a girl like her would have gotten into this career made even more unbelievable in that she meets a cute guy during the interview and nothing comes of it - he just tries to get syphillis at every opportunity.  She is likeable and friendly in the same way as Ellen Page inHard Candyand they both have naturally doll-like faces but she malevolent by omission and is flawed in her agreeing to do a Barbie Doll surgery when many doctors had refused to the patient's requests.  I think this responds to claims that the victims wanted it because as a doctor, you can refuse in the best interest of the misguided patient no matter how much you need the money so is does she represent the non-Nazi mercenaries who guarded the concentration camps and carried out the pogroms?  She DOES wear a leopard fur coat in one scene so maybe the filmmakers are commenting that despite the pleasant demeanor of the Pacific Northwest culture, people underneath it all don't change from their genetic makeup.Her Barbie patient gifts her with a dress that while green is not the green of Katherine Isabelle's Celtic heritage but the wintry jewel green of colder climes like Russia and the style of the dress albeit too low cut is similar to Grecian, Roman draping and then she is raped in it.Also, her first foray into surgery occurs after ""Black"" refuses to return to the club and a Doctor Black is at the rape party (Sabines are often depicted as redheads in paintings) who seems to be wearing those englarged pupils contact lenses popular in Japan for people who have snake eyes i.e. more whites than pupil in their eyes.Throughout the film, the main character wears black nail polish indicative of the Christian Mittel/Eastern European labeling of Jews as demonic and the directors star as the ""Demon Sisters of Berlin"" while Tristan Risk's Betty Boop's character is often in read reminiscent of the Big Bad Rolf's desire for Little Red Riding Hood.  But the main character also looks more and more vampire like as the film progresses and is introduced early-on as a first-generation HUNgarian American so maybe this is a shout out the Huns and Mongols who made life so difficult in the 13th Century for Jews.  In her last outfit, she wears a white dress but her black underwear shows through as there being a black ribbon running across her dress like the negro arroyo where Walter White resides in Breaking Bad.She DOES wear a leopard fur coat in one scene so maybe the filmmakers are commenting that despite the pleasant demeanor of the Pacific Northwest culture, people underneath it all don't change from their genetic makeup.The club owner who is a predator preying on female sex workers is played by an actor with Italian heritage interesingly from Bari, Italy - once a major slave port as well as significant in the war against Nazis in World War 2.

There are so many of them produced under conventional means - i.e. follow the basic `scare' formula - but every now and then one comes along with a flair all of its own, with a style all of its own, with a look all its own.  That's a cause for celebration - however modest - because flair, freshness, and originality aren't exactly available with every feature.  AMERICAN MARY has some wonderful touches, and - on those points alone - I think it's definitely worth seeing.  Will it be entirely satisfying?  I think that depends upon your personal tastes and expectations for character development.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, this ain't it!  Still, I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Mary Mason (played by the comely Katharine Isabelle) is your typical med school student struggling to make ends meet.  She's about to be kicked out of her classes for failing to keep up on her tuition payments when she answers an advertisement at a strip club for performing erotic massage.  Before the night is over, she's swept into a world of underground surgery - fixing up a victim for the club's owner - which only opens the door to an even stranger off-the-records business of body augmentation.  Suddenly, she's up to her elbows in blood and stitches.  What's an American Mary to do?It's easy to give kudos to AMERICAN MARY for attempting something original because, largely, that's what writer/director/sisters/stars Jen and Sylvia Soska did.  Unfortunately, that's all they did, as they amped up the `weird for the sake of being weird' factor but heavily scrimped on any (and I do mean ANY) emotional connection between these characters.  That's what I found a shame to the picture - I wanted to not so much `like' Mary Mason (I don't believe filmmakers ever really intend for us to like their villainous creations) but I wanted to fully `appreciate' the journey she was on.  However, Mary - as played by Katharine Isabelle - approaches the role pre- and post-catharsis (her rape and the subsequent descent into medical madness) absolutely devoid of any emotion.  In other words, before being awakened to this weird subculture, Mary behaves mostly passionless to all things; and, after being awakened to the same, she's still pretty much passionless.  Before being raped by what must be the most downright evil portrayal of a college professor/surgeon, she's passionless about life; and, after the assault, she's still pretty much devoid of any feelings.Now, maybe (and I do say MAYBE) that's what the sisters Soska wanted - to show that Mary was always destined to be what she became, that she was never going to be a victim in her world - but, if that was the case, how is it she could still casually dismiss the only person in this world her ever cared about her - her `Nana' - by simply deleting her telephone contact once she learned she died and THEN sit sulking in the dark?  If she wasn't going to be a victim of her emotions, then why the one scene sulking?  If it was to convey ""see, she's only human after all,"" then they've changed their message.  If it that wasn't the intent, then why include such a trivial plot development at all?That's the thing about Mary - I never know how she thinks about anything.  As a character, she simply `does' what she does.  At times, much of the film felt like what others call `torture porn,' but I never got the sense as a viewer that Mary took any delight in torturing those that she did.  The only legitimate display of emotion I can recall in the entire piece was when she was almost discovered, was konked over the head by a security guard, and then got back up and beat the young man (presumably to death).  While her face showed little emotion, her body betrayed her, thumping and thumping and thumping away on the body the way she did.  That was the only real emotional development Mary suffered, so I'm still left wondering what it was all about.AMERICAN MARY is produced by IndustryWorks Pictures, 430 Productions, American Mary Productions, and Twisted Twins Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled through XLrator Media.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds mostly very solid, though there's one really strangely miked club sequence wherein vocal levels clearly are out of whack (not a big deal, I just like mentioning these little things when I see `em).  The disc offers a making of short as well as a director's commentary, if you're so inclined.RECOMMENDED.  AMERICAN MARY is slow.  At 100-plus minutes and all the glowing praise I've read for the film, I was really expecting something more than just `weird for weird's sake.'  I don't know that this world - this bizarre body modification culture - is real (I suspect it is), but I kept wondering what the Soska Sisters were trying to say about it since it didn't seem particularly `American,' particularly `Mary' (i.e. routine, predictable), or particularly anything other than the portrait of a really unconventional class of people bordering on torture porn.  When I don't know what the message is, I don't know what to take away from the experience; when I don't know what to take away, then I'm left to my own devices ... this time out, my devices haven't a clue.",3,AMERICAN MARY's Message Buried Under Blood & Stitches,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,5548,"['Horror', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'sell', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'produced', 'conventional',

For my money, though, the film makers didn't quite know what to do with it.Here's the scoop. Mary Mason (Katherine Isabelle) is a money challenged med student poised to be a surgeon. She does a solid for a local strip club owner by sewing up a guy who crossed him. The solid gets her a quick $5,000.00. Word of her work runs through underground channels to people heavy into extreme body modification. She soon becomes a cult hit with that crowd. Meanwhile, one of her professors has invited her to a higher-up party where he proceeds to drug and rape her. She has the skills to deal with him. All this starts to get out of hand.The Soska Sisters, who helmed this outing, have a good sense of the bizarre. Seeing the makeup on some of the characters, such as Beatress and Ruby Realgirl, is both unsettling and fascinating at once. But nothing is really done to delve into the mindset of that type of person. The sisters do little to raise them above the level of freaks. Then there's the story itself. The set-up is good. Poor med student finds a way to put some serious cash in her purse. At first she's beside herself. Then, she not only gets into the swing of things, she seems to like it and prospers. The incident with her professor almost seems like a sideline and introduces a British accented detective who barely performs a perfunctory investigation. And the Soska Sisters show up as twin sister clients who want something really weird done to ""join"" them but you don't really see what that something is. Then the end happens way too suddenly and unexpected in a way that seemed tacked on. Like they just needed to wrap things up.The gore is cool. The acting is decent to good.

The works pays handsomely but she sees it as a one time thing and spends days terrified of what is going to happen to her as a result of her work.  Other circumstances ensue which pull her into the bizarre world of extreme body modification.  People pay her to make them look exactly how they want even if what they want is freakish.  She also uses her skills as revenge.  There are some definitely unsettling moments in the movie.  There just wasn't much of a plot at all.  The story is the strange, unnatural surgeries that she performs.  The bit of backstory that you get doesn't really help you understand why this otherwise normal seeming woman takes so easily to this type of work.

1635439,A34HYR92HYZV0,B00BLNDVGU,Jake Justus,"[4, 6]","Jen and Sylvia Soska's AMERICAN MARY is one of best cinematic surprises to come along in years. Their debut film, DEAD HOOKER IN A TRUNK, was hugely entertaining and showed great promise. With AMERICAN MARY, the ""indy"" sensibility of HOOKER (which, admittedly, was one of its charms) has been replaced by a mature, comprehensive style. This is a film that could have been made by seasoned filmmakers with decades of experience.Although marketed as a ""horror"" movie, AMERICAN MARY is so much more. At its heart is a revenge tale. And, like all good revenge stories, the person seeking revenge undergoes a psychological change in the course of events. Katharine Isabelle creates a Mary that is no carbon-copy movie character. Despite the bloody business at hand, there's a vulnerable side to her, a thoughtful side that adds depth to the character and also keeps the audience wondering. If we lived in an alternate universe where the Academy Awards actually meant something, Katharine Isabelle would get an Oscar for this role.The Soska sisters know their stuff. DEAD HOOKER IN A TRUNK introduced us to their creative visual style and enjoyably warped perspective on life's twists and turns (emphasis on the twists). In AMERICAN MARY, they up their own ante. If there is any justice at all in this world, they will keep making movies for many years to come.AMERICAN MARY is an intriguing film from start to finish.

1635444,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00BLNDVGU,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 1]","I wasn't thrilled with this film, but I remain very interested to see what the Soska sisters do next.  Horror has plenty of remakes and recycled concepts.  So I was happy to see this film for a nice change of pace and style.  Fans of body modification should enjoy this for what it is.The scoring does a fine job enhancing the politely visceral tone as we first meet medical student Mary (Katharine Isabelle) practicing her incision and suturing skills on a store bought turkey.  Talented, but finding herself in a difficult financial situation, Mary lets a club owner hire her to play ""mob doctor"" for cash.  This slowly begins to resculpt Mary's moral compass, transforming her from almost naively innocent to readily corruptible.Shortly thereafter, we meet the surgically distorted Beatress (Tristan Risk), a cartoonishly weird character who pulls Mary deeper into her illegal medical practice.  Beatress and her friends are interested in elective surgeries that are refused by doctors because of their extremity.  As Mary accommodates these taboo surgical desires, she herself desires more novel modifications to stimulate herself.  This swings into body modifications beyond what you'd find leafing through the latest issue of Taboo magazine and she even uses her unique niche skill set to exact revenge on those who have wronged her as she climbs her way into underground subcultural fame.Needless to say, it's hard to write about this movie without ruining the surprises within.The acting falls short of the highly effective tone, the dialogue falls even shorter.  It's disappointing.  I really wanted to take these characters seriously but I found it impossible.  I was especially irked by the attempts to depict entitled, egomaniacal surgeons.  It was as if someone started the background of a masterpiece with this especially taboo tone, scored and set so well with an underutilized premise, but then filled the foreground with poor writing and stale delivery.  I thought Katherine Isabelle did VERY well in Ginger Snaps and her small role in Being Human, but now I'm left to wonder if this rigid performance was the fault of her direction or her own acting.  I'd prefer to blame the direction, which failed to impress on several other accounts as well.  And Katherine was not outperformed by any other members of the cast.This film was written and directed by Jen and Sylvia Soska. They haven't done much and I felt that it showed.  The inclusion of elective genital modification surgery, rape and surgery addicts felt forced.  These concepts are naturally shocking on their own; they don't need to be over-sold.  I really wanted to believe that this was meant to be more than another pervy exploitative shock flick.  But once I saw how Jen and Sylvia Soska wrote themselves into the movie with over-the-top body modification extremists, it was apparent that they were more concerned with celebrating body modification than they were with telling an interesting story.  They may have been passionate about this film.  But it strikes me that they never considered how others would view the film without living life through the lens of their subculture.This review comes with its share of negative criticism, but I'm also very interested to see what else the Soska sisters can do and what kinds of projects they'll pursue.  Horror has plenty of remakes and recycled concepts.  So I was happy to see this film for a nice change of pace and style.",3,I was happy to see this film for a nice change of pace and style,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,3454,"['was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'film', 'remain', 'very', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'Soska', 'sisters', 'do', 'next', 'Horror', 'plenty', 'remakes', 'recycled', 'concepts', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'film', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'style', 'Fans', 'body', 'modification', 'should', 'enjoy', 'what', 'scoring', 'fine', 'job', 'enhancing', 'politely', 'visceral', 'tone', 'first', 'meet', 'medical', 'student', 'Mary', 'Katharine', 'Isabelle', 'practicing', 'incision', 'suturing', 'skills', 'store', 'bought', 'turkey', 'Talented', 'finding', 'difficult', 'financial', 'situation', 'Mary', 'club', 'owner', 'hire', 'play', 'mob', 'doctor', 'cash', 'slowly', 'resculpt', 'Mary', 'moral', 'compass', 'transforming', 'almost', 'naively', 'innocent', 'readily', 'corruptible.Shortly', 'thereafter', 'meet', 'surgically', 'distorted', 'Beatress', 'Tristan', 'Risk', 'cartoonishly', 'weird', 'character', 'who', 'Mary', 'deeper', 'illegal', 'medical', 'practice', 'Beatress', 'friends', 'are', 'interested', 'elective', 'surgeries', 'are', 'refused', 'doctors', 'extremity', 'Mary', 'accommodates', 'taboo', 'surgical', 'desires', 'herself', 'desires', 'more', 'novel', 'modifications', 'stimulate', 'swings', 'body', 'modifications', 'what', ""'d"", 'find', 'leafing', 'latest', 'issue', 'Taboo', 'magazine', 'even', 'unique', 'niche', 'skill', 'set', 'exact', 'revenge', 'who', 'have', 'wronged', 'way', 'underground', 'subcultural', 'fame.Needless', 'say', 'hard', 'write', 'movie', 'ruining', 'surprises', 'within.The', 'acting', 'falls', 'short', 'highly', 'effective', 'tone', 'dialogue', 'even', 'shorter', 'disappointing', 'really', 'wanted', 'take', 'characters', 'seriously', 'found', 'impossible', 'was', 'especially', 'irked', 'attempts', 'depict', 'entitled', 'egomaniacal', 'surgeons', 'was', 'someone', 'started', 'background', 'masterpiece', 'especially', 'taboo', 'tone', 'scored', 'set', 'so', 'well', 'underutilized', 'premise', 'then', 'filled', 'foreground', 'poor', 'writing', 'stale', 'delivery', 'thought', 'Katherine', 'Isabelle', 'did', 'VERY', 'well', 'Ginger', 'Snaps', 'small', 'role', 'Being', 'Human', 'now', ""'m"", 'left', 'wonder', 'rigid', 'performance', 'was', 'fault', 'direction', 'own', 'acting', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'blame', 'direction', 'failed', 'impress', 'several', 'other', 'accounts', 'well', 'Katherine', 'was', 'not', 'outperformed', 'other', 'members', 'cast.This', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Jen', 'Sylvia', 'Soska', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'much', 'felt', 'showed', 'inclusion', 'elective', 'genital', 'modification', 'surgery', 'rape', 'surgery', 'addicts', 'felt', 'forced', 'concepts', 'are', 'naturally', 'shocking', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'over-sold', 'really', 'wanted', 'believe', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'more', 'pervy', 'exploitative', 'shock', 'flick', 'once', 'saw', 'how', 'Jen', 'Sylvia', 'Soska', 'wrote', 'movie', 'over-the-top', 'body', 'modification', 'was', 'apparent', 'were', 'more', 'concerned', 'celebrating', 'body', 'modification', 'were', 'telling', 'interesting', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'passionate', 'film', 'never', 'considered', 'how', 'others', 'would', 'view', 'film', 'living', 'life', 'lens', 'subculture.This', 'review', 'share', 'negative', 'criticism', ""'m"", 'also', 'very', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'else', 'Soska', 'sisters', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'kinds', 'projects', ""'ll"", 'pursue', 'Horror', 'plenty', 'remakes', 'recycled', 'concepts', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'film', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'style']",N/A

Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","&#34;American Mary&#34; is one of those films that's meant to be disturbing to mainstream audiences because it features a taboo subject, in this case extreme body modification.  It's a dark noir that's as much about turning you on as it is about squicking you out.Mary Mason (Katharine Isabelle) is a struggling medical student hoping to become a surgeon. Desperate, she decides to turn to stripping. While she's there to strip, her services are put to better use saving a tortured man for $5,000.  And just like that, Mary discovers that she can make more money sewing flesh up rather than showing it off.Word gets out and it's not long before a Betty Boop-style mostly-plastic doll named Beatress (Tristan risk)shows up to offer a new job: turning Ruby Realgirl (Paula Lindberg) into a real doll -- as in, smooth all over.  And so Mary moves from the underworld of criminal surgery to the seedy underworld of body modification.So far, so good. Mary unwisely accepts invitation to attend a party hosted by her professor, Dr. Grant (David Lovgren). Dr. Grant drugs her up and rapes her.  He's so egotistical that he leaves her, dazed and wandering, at his own place as if she were just a tipsy date.This does not go over well with Mary.  Her disillusionment with the medical establishment fuels her new career, cutting and slashing her way to success through her enemies and clients. That choice will ultimately be her downfall.&#34;American Mary&#34; is an original film with a twist on the typical revenge fantasy, but it's unfortunately marred by dream sequences and an occasionally scattershot plot that loses its focus.  It's also not quite as horrifying as it thinks -- the extreme body modification doesn't really go far enough to impress horror fans.

The acting way decent for most of its cast and its characters are fairly well developed. The lighting works well to help develop the dark and eerie mood of the film as well as the primary clothing colors (red & black) used. The story isn't new, but thankfully it's different enough to have peeked my intrest to give it a try. The stories big departure from the girl stripping to performing surgeries was both interesting and a bit of a disappointment. Let me try to explain. Mary is a top notch student and for her to take the route she does and throw away her career doesn't make much sense because of her looks and her body she could have caught up with her past due bills within 2 weeks if that. Now with that said, after her ordeal I can see her going astray to a degree, again she is a top pick who is driven and arrogant. Mary is not what you would call an emotional person nor is she kind hearted or loving. Her baggage makes it hard for me to like her, but I still feel for what she went through. I think the story could have been more believable if she wasn't at the top and could loose so much.  The doctor's interactions with Mary in the classroom were over the top when he addresses her as was the silly hospital scene when she tells a family the bad news without knowing the how's or why's. I found Mary's performance good except for some occasions when she was being serious her tone comes across as condecending. The same tone she uses when she addresses the Betty Boop's character who drove her nuts or others that she dislikes (which is most everyone). My other issues are with her skills, actions and judgements in regards to her medical training and the execution of those practices. Her first surgery was without gloves on a low life druggie who has who knows what???  When she is suturing the incisions of her plastic surgery patients she is using to large of a gauge of thread and her sutures are spaced to far appart.. She doesn't have any of the manatory medical equipment that she would need to preform the procedures that she does especially on the co writers/directors that double as twin patients. At her stage of medical school she was only practicing on her suturing skills, so she takes a huge leap forward performing all those surgeries.  With all of its issues American Mary is still one of the better B movies made especially considering its budget.Tthe writers/directors are on a steady path of honing their skills to a fine art.

It implies the situation has reached a turning point and something must be done. Something that a person would not normally choose to do. Something that will have consequences beyond the immediate need. The `Twisted Twins', Jen and Sylvia Soska, are two filmmakers who know how to take that idea and run with it in new and different ways. The pair co-wrote and co-directed ""American Mary"" a film that shows a dark and interesting path that desperation can lead to.""American Mary"" tells the story of Mary Mason (Katherine Isabelle), a talented medical school student whose intelligence and drive mark her for a great career as a surgeon... if she can finish school. Mary's financial situation is bad and getting worse as she spends her time trying figure out how she can pay the bills. The distraction caused by a lack of money puts her at odds with her instructors, especially Dr. Grant (David Lovgren), who seems to have a special interest in Mary.Mary is extremely intelligent, but she sees no way that her medical skills can help her, so she decides to use her looks instead and goes to a local adult club for an audition. The club's owner, Billy (Antonio Cupo), is warming up to her and appears ready to put her through the classic `casting couch' interview process when his bouncer comes in and tells him one of his guys is hurt. Since many of Billy's activities aren't strictly legal, he can't just take the guy to a hospital. Instead he turns to Mary and asks for help. At first she is reluctant. Practising medicine without a license could cost Mary her future, but $5000 in cash seems too good to pass up and Mary takes the job on condition that Billy tell no one.Later, Mary is approached by Beatrice (Tristan Risk) one of the club's dancers. Beatrice has a strange look about her, almost like she's a living doll and it's obvious she's had more than one surgery to make her the way she is. Surprisingly enough, the woman wants Mary to help her friend Ruby. Ruby is a fashion designer who has the same, doll-like look as Beatrice. But Ruby wants to be freed of the distractions that her sexual appeal causes her, so she wants to become a living Barbie doll: beautiful, but non-sexual. Again Mary is reluctant, but the allure of the cash is too much. Soon Mary has her own side business doing body modifications for those who can afford her quality of work.Dr. Grant notices Mary's new found financial freedom and assumes that she's selling herself, which leads him to invite her to a `surgeons party' with many of his colleagues.  Mary is honored to be invited to such an exclusive event, but she soon falls victim to Grant as he reveals the only reason any women are invited to one of the parties.Now Mary wants revenge and she's in a unique position to have it, but what will she do with a man like Grant for whom killing is too good? Her new sideline offers a world of choices, and her underworld connections help her make whatever she can imagine come true. But as Mary goes further and further down the rabbit hole into the sub-culture of body modification, will she find a way out or will her work come back to haunt her in ways she never imagined?Jen and Sylvia Soska's film ""American Mary"" is a stunningly inventive film that takes modern ideas of horror and mixes them with Hitchcockian era filmmaking. It would have been easy for the sisters to go over the top with gore and blood just for the sake of shock value, but instead they keep much of the actual cutting off the screen. They show the results, often disturbing and unsettling in themselves, but they leave most of the violence to the imagination. They make Mary's revenge scenes even more horrific as she describes what she will do without the audience having to watch each horrific act. That's not to say there isn't blood and gore. On the contrary, it is there. But unlike many modern horror films that throw it in `willy-nilly' for the shock value, ""American Mary"" uses it as an integral part of the story.Katherine Isabelle is wonderful in the role of Mary Mason, bringing the character to life emotionally. She comes across as intelligent, confident and most of all genuine. As the film progresses and Mary becomes more entwined in the subculture of the film, she grows to be a dark reflection of the world she's entered, losing touch with her old life.  It's also fun to see Jen and Sylvia appear in a small roll as a pair of twins who want to become closer and with Mary's help they may get their wish and maybe a bit more.""American Mary"" is a perfect example of what talented filmmakers can do when they are allowed to step outside of the norm. As the over the top blockbusters from Hollywood show us time and again, it is easy for studios to throw money at `safe' projects and to substitute effects for story. What these $100 million plus mega-movies often forget though is that the root of any film, horror, romance, action, or whatever, is the story. Jen and Sylvia Soska have shown they haven't forgotten that, and we can only hope they continue to bring quality back to the screen. So check out Jen and Sylvia Soska's ""American Mary"" - it's a cut and a suture above the rest.",5,American Mary is a cut above most horror,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,5218,"['Desperation', 'word',
