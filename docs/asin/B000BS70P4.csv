948875,AKV2BGUT50B1X,B000BS70P4,,"[1, 1]","This movie is a documentary featuring the philosophical ideas of FrancisSchaeffer.  His ideas are best packaged for all sorts of people in his bookHow Should We Then Live.  This movie is thus based on that book.The movie is filmed on location in Western Europe.  Schaeffer argues thatmodern man is in a state of despair in part because of the humanism whicharose out of the Renaissance.  Roman Catholic Europe has stagnated vs.Protestant north western Europe because the northern Europeans embraced theideas of the Reformation, which had God at its center while the Renaissanceput Man at the center.There are discussions of Art and Art History which emphasizes this idea.He further emphasizes that Humanism has transmitted into other political disasters, especially the French Revolution and the Bolshevik takeover in Russia.Schaeffer argues that the counter cultural revolution of the 1960s is an irrational leap of faith within the existentialist construct and the spiritualist hippies will come full circle to the despair of their parents.  (Present day-2014-news flash:  They do come full circle.)Schaeffer then goes on to describe how ""Historic Christianity"" (i.e.Protestantism) offers a solution to despair for humanity.  He makes a prettygood case.  He does this through a study of different historical ages.In this movie there are several down points.  First is that Schaeffer arguesthat a society without absolutes (his absolutes are not fully defined) drivesto a point where society itself is absolute.  This leads to tyranny.There is an unfortunate invocation of Godwin's Rule of Nazi Analogies here.  The problem is that absolutes are clearly being used in Society today.  However, those absolutes can be invented out of thin air.  Additionally, absolutes often contain principles which appear moral in one sense but can be used for wickedness in another.  For example, the civil rights era laws and ideas that advanced the interests of American Negroes are now used to advance the interests of homosexuals.  I don't wish to imply that one or the other is moral or wicked but I hope reader gets the point.So, what absolutes is Schaeffer speaking about?  He never answers clearly.The weakest point of Schaeffer's philosophy is that he fails to recognizeracial and religious conflict.  He insists that had previous generationsfollowed his ideas there wouldn't have been race slavery.  This idea ispreposterous on its face as slavery is allowed in the Bible.Additionally, he fails to recognize that some people might be using philosophy as a weapon in ethnic conflict.  One scene in the movie shows Bettina Aptheker, a Jewish protester interviewed at some 60s sit-in or another.  She endorses Communism through moral and idealistic methods.  Schaeffer argues that Communism is a humanist heresy based on Christian principles and Ms. Aptheker is just ""off"" in her idealism.This reviewer is somewhat more cynical.  Today, Ms. Aptheker is a professor at some women's studies department.  It is likely that both in 1960s and today, she is using philosophy as a weapon of ethnic conflict.  One cannot help but suspect that The Jew Aptheker's preaching of feminist ideology on sexual behavior and reproductive ""rights"" is her method to manipulate ""shiska"" to damage their reproductive organs.On the whole the movie is pretty interesting and many of Schaeffer's ideaswill last.",4,How Should One Live?

Kelley,"[51, 54]","If you have never read a general book on apologetics or seen a DVD on this subject or perhaps the history of philosophy, How Should we then Live is an excellent start. Schaeffer not only has a deep appreciation of scripture (which is not preachy & sparingly used) but also see the philosophies of the past & realizes how important it is to know that ""IDEAS HAVE CONSEQUENCES"". Understanding this, Schaeffer creates a systamatic approach toward today's cultural shortcomings by taking the manhy pieces of history, theology & philosophy & weaving this patchwork pieces into a grand blanket of scriptural, historical & social truth of our age.My favorite part is not very enjoyable but a vivid reminder of the 21st century foibles as seen from the 1st century. Early in the DVD, Schaeffer answers the questions, Why did the Roman Empire persecute the Christians?"" Many think it is because they worshipped Christ that they underwent so much punishment in the first 400 years of the church. But schaeffer skillfully shows that it was the treason of the church to buck the trend of the time and worship Christ along with Jupiter, and many other gods. The church was seen as hardheaded & treasonous because everyone was expected to say ""Caesar is Lord!!"" in public & then allowed to worship any religion they wanted to in private. But the Christians said ""Christ is Lord"" alone & would not bow to any other god/goddess. Thus they were sent as a threat to the culture of your scratch my politcal-religious back & I'll scratch yours. The Christians seemed so bull-headed & then people tried to condemn them by pointing out they could not be trusted, they were blasphomous toward emperor worship & thus, were seditious because the Christians seem to ""eat blood & flesh""in secret meetings they  called a Lord's supper, so they were obviously up to no good for the Empire.Schaeffer does a great of showing that which gave the western civilization Lex Rex and the present Constitution the US has.This is enjoyable for religious, spiritual, historic or philosophic students.",5,Excellent interpretation of our relativistic era.,1141948800,"03 10, 2006",2006,2060,"['have', 'never', 'read', 'general', 'book', 'apologetics', 'seen', 'DVD', 'subject', 'perhaps', 'history', 'philosophy', 'How', 'Should', 'then', 'Live', 'excellent', 'start', 'Schaeffer', 'not', 'only', 'deep', 'appreciation', 'scripture', 'not', 'preachy', 'sparingly', 'used', 'also', 'see', 'philosophies', 'past', 'how', 'important', 'know', 'IDEAS', 'HAVE', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'Understanding', 'Schaeffer', 'systamatic', 'approach', 'today', 'cultural', 'shortcomings', 'taking', 'manhy', 'pieces', 'history', 'theology', 'philosophy', 'weaving', 'patchwork', 'grand', 'blanket', 'scriptural', 'historical', 'social', 'truth', 'age.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'not', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'vivid', 'reminder', '21st', 'century', 'foibles', 'seen', '1st', 'century', 'Early', 'DVD', 'Schaeffer', 'questions', 'Why', 'did', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'Christians', 'Many', 'think', 'worshipped', 'Christ', 'underwent', 'so', 'much', 'punishment', 'first', '400', 'years', 'church', 'schaeffer', 'skillfully', 'was', 'treason', 'church', 'buck', 'trend', 'time', 'worship', 'Christ', 'Jupiter', 'many', 'other', 'gods', 'church', 'was', 'seen', 'hardheaded', 'treasonous', 'everyone', 'was', 'expected', 'say', 'Caesar', 'Lord', 'public', 'then', 'allowed', 'worship', 'religion', 'wanted', 'private', 'Christians', 'said', 'Christ', 'Lord', 'alone', 'would', 'not', 'bow', 'other', 'god/goddess', 'Thus', 'were', 'sent', 'threat', 'culture', 'scratch', 'politcal-religious', 'back', ""'ll"", 'scratch', 'yours', 'Christians', 'seemed', 'so', 'bull-headed', 'then', 'people', 'tried', 'condemn', 'pointing', 'out', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'trusted', 'were', 'blasphomous', 'emperor', 'worship', 'thus', 'were', 'seditious', 'Christians', 'seem', 'eat', 'blood', 'flesh', 'secret', 'meetings', 'called', 'Lord', 'supper', 'were', 'obviously', 'good', 'Empire.Schaeffer', 'great', 'showing', 'gave', 'western', 'civilization', 'Lex', 'Rex', 'present', 'Constitution', 'US', 'has.This', 'enjoyable', 'religious', 'spiritual', 'historic', 'philosophic', 'students']",N/A
