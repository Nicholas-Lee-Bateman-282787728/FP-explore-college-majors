Rhys-Meyers is handsome and passionate (if almost always wrong-headed), as opposed to the doughy, wooden George of Tim Holt in the original. The casting of Jennifer Tilly was a brave experiment: Aunt Fanny as a voluptuous, well-fed kitten of a woman rather than the spare, bird-like Fanny of (the superlative) Agnes Moorehead. Unfortunately, the director betrays her at every turn, especially in the wrestling matches in which she's obliged to engage with her nephew. I found Bruce Greenwood fairly pallid and uninvolving, though his last letter to his ""true love"" (the beautiful Madeleine Stowe, who was amazingly convincing as the very young Isabelle) did move me to tears. This film is quite an accomplishment, if also heart-breakingly misguided at times.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[30, 31]","Much ado is made about the dual ending of classic film ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" which was originally made by Orson Welles. The remake is more or less faithful to the original material, but some bad casting (Jennifer Tilly is the worst example), weird scripting, and a rather ambiguous tone scratch it up.George (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is the youngest member of the rich Amberson family, including his grandfather, mother, uncle and aunt. He's been raised as a prince, and he acts like one too -- spoiled and imperious. He falls in love with the beautiful Lucy (Gretchen Mol), the daughter of automobile innovator Eugene (Bruce Greenwood). Unfortunately, Eugene has always been in love with George's mother Isabel (Madeleine Stowe).Jealous and disapproving of the ""new money"" people, George sets out to wreck the budding relationship between his mother and Eugene. He succeeds -- but at the cost of his own relationship with Lucy. Still imperious, George continues on his way without knowing that the growing urban sprawl marks the decline of the Amberson family into poverty...It's always interesting to see how society changed in the past, as it does here and ""The Forsyte Saga."" And that's actually the most interesting part of ""Magnificent Ambersons,"" not the family saga. Unfortunately, we only get an occasional glimpse of this. The rest of the time, it's merely more of George's tedious tantrums, and his family worrying about money and relationships.Alfonso Arau seems to have been sleeping during the production of this -- he adds a sparkling grandeur to the early scenes. But the color fades quickly; pretty soon it's just a slow decline, with little to hold your interest. The only thing he adds to the production is an emphasis on the incestuous feelings between Isabel and George. It's icky, and feels like it was just pasted in.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is a good actor, but only in the last eighth of the movie do we develop any liking or understanding of his character. Greenwood is fairly good, and Stowe is a convincing wilting lily, although she doesn't do much else. Gretchen Mol brightens every scene she's in, and William Hootkins (as hearty Uncle George) is a lovable teddy, but Jennifer Tilly ruins every scene she's in with a screechy, over-the-top performance.It's interesting to see the decline of the old-money dynasties in favor of the ""riffraff.""

686035,A1QSZ53SD7QIRD,B00005UW73,"empressT ""Luv2Read""","[2, 2]","Well, Orson Welles studio-hatchet original vision of The Magnificent Ambersons (""TMA1"") is closer in scope and breadth to the tone of Booth Tarkington's early 20th century novel. A look at a turn of the century, wealthy Indianapolis family, with all of the changes enveloping the country, doesn't need much ""sprucing."" Somehow director Alfonso Arau manages to over AND under direct what should've been a sweeping spectacle.A&E; are masters at providing classic entertainment adapted from long-forgotten book masterpieces (i.e. Horatio Hornblower series), but this lagging, dragging, mess of a miniseries feels like it should NOT have been tackled because of the numerous half-stepped jobs most of the cast gave. There are some very fine actors in this (James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, William Hootkins, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Madeleine Stowe), but only Hootkins (as Uncle George Amberson) seems to really grasp the idea of Tarkington's idea of privileged, American gentility being pushed aside for self-made men and women.I've seen the majority of Jonathan Rhys Meyers's work (and am a great admirer of him in most of it), but I have to say his take on George Amberson Minafer is grating. Yes, Georgie is a snob, a self-proclaimed ""right sort of fellow,"" but there is a disconnect with the viewer. I know I'm supposed to dislike Georgie but somehow JRM's portrayal falls short (and it's not just because of the accent-although he's Irish, JRM can do a fine American, British, even a Welsh accent!). His finest moment may have come with the stare down with Greenwood's Eugene Morgan. Those blue eyes really do bore holes into your soul.Jennifer Tilly's Aunt Fanny Minafer is not even worth a mention except to say that she and Stowe's Isabelle Amberson Minafer don't seem to age even though there's a 22 year range in the series. James Cromwell provides a welcome relief to all of the hysterics when he's on screen (but that only happens for about 15 min. in the entire, bloated film!), and Gretchen Mol can emote more than just pasting a smile on her face (see her in THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAIGE for proof).Director Arau plays up this Oedipal-like idea between Georgie and Isabelle, but that is NOT evidenced in the novel. His ideas are just wrong and ""fluff-filler"" for most of the film (the opening sequence of the Tango as an example; the Tango wasn't introduced to the US until 1912, and it didn't come from Europe, but from Argentina-hence the name: Argentine Tango...small things like this added nothing to TMA2).For such a fine cast, compelling material, and a relatively large budget, TMA2 fails to make its mark. 2 stars (the costumes were lovely and authentic looking).",2,A Magnificent Slumber...,1217980800,"08 6, 2008",2008,2678,"['Well', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'studio-hatchet', 'original', 'vision', 'Magnificent', 'Ambersons', 'TMA1', 'closer', 'scope', 'breadth', 'tone', 'Booth', 'Tarkington', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'novel', 'look', 'turn', 'century', 'wealthy', 'Indianapolis', 'family', 'changes', 'enveloping', 'country', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'sprucing', 'Somehow', 'director', 'Alfonso', 'Arau', 'AND', 'direct', 'what', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sweeping', 'spectacle.A', 'E', 'are', 'masters', 'providing', 'classic', 'entertainment', 'adapted', 'long-forgotten', 'book', 'masterpieces', 'i.e', 'Horatio', 'Hornblower', 'series', 'lagging', 'dragging', 'mess', 'miniseries', 'feels', 'should', 'NOT', 'have', 'been', 'tackled', 'numerous', 'half-stepped', 'jobs', 'most', 'cast', 'gave', 'are', 'very', 'fine', 'actors', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'William', 'Hootkins', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'only', 'Hootkins', 'Uncle', 'George', 'Amberson', 'really', 'grasp', 'idea', 'Tarkington', 'idea', 'privileged', 'American', 'gentility', 'being', 'pushed', 'self-made', 'men', 'women.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'majority', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'work', 'am', 'great', 'admirer', 'most', 'have', 'say', 'take', 'George', 'Amberson', 'Minafer', 'grating', 'Yes', 'Georgie', 'snob', 'self-proclaimed', 'right', 'sort', 'fellow', 'disconnect', 'viewer', 'know', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'dislike', 'Georgie', 'somehow', 'JRM', 'portrayal', 'short', 'not', 'just', 'accent-although', 'Irish', 'JRM', 'can', 'do', 'fine', 'American', 'British', 'even', 'Welsh', 'accent', 'finest', 'moment', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'stare', 'down', 'Greenwood', 'Eugene', 'Morgan', 'blue', 'eyes', 'really', 'do', 'bore', 'holes', 'soul.Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'Aunt', 'Fanny', 'Minafer', 'not', 'even', 'mention', 'say', 'Stowe', 'Isabelle', 'Amberson', 'Minafer', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'age', 'even', '22', 'year', 'range', 'series', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'welcome', 'relief', 'hysterics', 'when', 'screen', 'only', '15', 'min', 'entire', 'bloated', 'film', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'can', 'emote', 'more', 'just', 'pasting', 'smile', 'face', 'see', 'THE', 'NOTORIOUS', 'BETTIE', 'PAIGE', 'proof', '.Director', 'Arau', 'up', 'Oedipal-like', 'idea', 'Georgie', 'Isabelle', 'NOT', 'evidenced', 'novel', 'ideas', 'are', 'just', 'wrong', 'fluff-filler', 'most', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Tango', 'example', 'Tango', 'was', ""n't"", 'introduced', 'US', '1912', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'Europe', 'Argentina-hence', 'name', 'Argentine', 'Tango', 'small', 'things', 'added', 'nothing', 'TMA2', '.For', 'fine', 'cast', 'compelling', 'material', 'relatively', 'large', 'budget', 'TMA2', 'make', 'mark', '2', 'stars', 'costumes', 'were', 'lovely', 'authentic', 'looking']",N/A
686036,A358AG4MJTFVTS,B00005UW73,E. Simpson,"[0, 0]","Everyone in this movie is well-cast and does a fine job with the material *except* (as numerous other reviewers have already noted) Jennifer Tilly and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. I found myself wishing that these 2 actors were in fewer scenes because I enjoyed the film when I didn't have to watch them: the costumes and location are lovely and if those 2 actors had performed up the the standards of the rest of the cast, this would have been a fine film with which I would still have had some issues, but it would hold up. As it was, I kept wishing that the turn-of-the-century had therapy groups so happy people like the Morgans could get help avoiding obvious psychos like the Amberson mother and son. Rhys Meyers literally delivers a performance of a lead character as a crazed, bug-eyed, petulant, brat with no redeeming social value and that would be more suited to playing a Roman Emperor. He was literally someone only a mother could love and that performance destroyed the credibility of Lucy feeling any attraction for his character - which is essential to the story.Thinking through things as I write this review, I blame the director. He clearly made choices to forego subtlety in other aspects of the film (the incestuous aspect of the mother and son, as well as some less intrusive matters like dance, for example). The tangled emotions between the unhappily married mother and her only son did not require a physical component for the modern audience to ""get"" that these 2 had issues and that ""boundaries"" were first among them. The dignified performances by James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, and Madeleine Stowe (except in scenes with the son) possess an appropriate, understated dignity that is jarringly absent in the 2 problematic performances. I have to think that the director didn't exercise proper control because the performance excesses fit within his vision. That's unfortunate.

Anyway, I soon got used to them &amp; their portrayals.  I still think Tim Holt (in the original 1942 film) did a more subtle job of portraying Georgie's casual snobbishness --  not as aggressively surly as in the remake -- but even that improves near the end.  Too bad A&amp;E determined to stick so closely to the original screenplay.  They lost the opportunity to take advantage of the lengthier running time by fleshing out the plot , restoring more details from the novel.  Anyone who enjoys the original film and/or this remake would enjoy reading the novel -- it's not as old-fashioned or wordy as other novels of its time -- it is a good fast read today and has more characters and subplots than either film.  It holds up very well.  Most of the dialogue in both films comes virtually word-for-word from the novel.  I read the novel after being dazzled by Welles's 1942 film -- as soon as I finished reading, I started right in on reading it a second time.  One of the themes in both the novel &amp; the 2 films is snobbery -- so here's a bit of trivia -- it is significant that Georgie's horse is named &quot;Pendennis&quot; -- &quot;Pendennis&quot; is the name of the title character in William Makepeace Thackeray's novel satirizing snobbery.  The novel was ahead of its time in dealing with the theme of air pollution from factories &amp; automobile exhaust -- Welles intended to deal with this in his film, but the studio cut almost all of this out.  A&amp;E's remake partially restores some of this theme, but more could have been done with this by consulting the novel.  Tarkington wrote 3 novels dealing with air pollution &amp; the decline of the quality of life -- he published the 3 novels in one volume under the collective title &quot;Growth&quot;  -- &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; is one of the 3 novels.  Now we need a DVD of the 1942 film with all the &quot;bells &amp; whistles&quot; extras.  Too bad the studio destroyed Welles's cut footage -- maybe we can hope that some brave studio insider made a copy of it and that it will eventually come to light.

While some things work, and the backstory of the declining family is more interesting than the self-absorbed creeps who are front and center, this thing flops around gasping for air for a painfully long time. Why, I kept asking myself.I have seen many of these actors in other films, and they are all competent or good. But here, every note, every speech, every aside feels forced and contrived. They even walk woodenly. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, a new one for me, is just awful, a tedious and exasperating automaton who is without a trace of humanity. OK, maybe that's the character, but why does he talk like that? And I learn he is Irish. So why, in a huge sprawling film like this, do they use an Irish actor to create a Midwestern voice? It is all wrong, never once sounding like a person. Emblematic of much more.Masterpiece Theater uses skilled actors who capture the nuances of their characters and make them spring alive. This was the most stagnant production I've ever endured. The actors are usually standing stiffly or glaring. Even the dancing was stolid. Four turgid hours of clumsiness. So if everyone is awful, the pacing is comatose, and the whole thing is chilly and cold, it must be the director. Never have I been so aware of good intentions gone awry.

His take on ""The Magnificant Ambersons"" not only fails to redeem Orson Welles' 1942 vision, it fails on the level of fundamental storytelling.It wasn't the fault of the story.Boothe Tarkington's novel about the decline of the land-wealthy, prestigious Amberson family in the face of modernization, the Industrial Revolution and growth of the middle class was a grand American tale.It wasn't for lack of money.The production had a lavish budget. It was shot at an old estate in Ireland and no expense was spared constructing a set that looked like turn-of-the-century Indianapolis.It wasn't the fault of the actors.The wonderful cast included such talented actors as James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, Madeline Stowe and Jonathan Rhys Meyers.Arau gave most of them too little to do.In the role of Major Amberson, a Civil War veteran made good on land speculation, Cromwell should have given us more insight into the actions and past of the Ambersons - how that led to the warped, rigid value system of his grandson, Georgie.Georgie Minafer (Rhys Meyers) is supposed to have charms that buffer his dark tendencies to be bigoted, narrow-minded and incestuous, he acts like a brat with attention defecit disorder, always flailing about.His character never gets to move beyond one whining, pouting note.Thus, when circumstances force a change on his part, the change seems wholely implausible.Before its release, star Madeline Stowe bemoaned the production, which probably wasn't the right thing to do.In hindsight, though, I can understand her complaint.Although her character is meant to charm two men in her life - the lost love of her youth (played by Greenwood) and her son, she seems almost robot-like.Stowe complained that Arau emphasized the incestous tendency between Georgie and his mother, Isabel, but frankly no heat or sparks of that kind were generated.Again, I blame Arau because I have seen Rhys Meyers deliver marvelous performances in ""Gormenghast,"" Ang Lee's ""Ride With the Devil"" and lesser known Irish gems such as ""Michael Collins"" and ""The Disappearance of Finbar.""I recommend you rent one of them...",2,Long-awaited and disappointing,1013472000,"02 12, 2002",2002,2422,"['delayed', 'release', 'Magnificant', 'Ambersons', 'year', 'completion', 'now', 'know', 'editors', 'hoped', 'post', 'production', 'create', 'what', 'Director', 'Alfonso', 'Arau', 'could', 'not', 'realize', 'film.With', 'quirky', 'direction', 'Arau', 'aimed', 'sublime', 'ended', 'up', 'something', 'ridiculous', 'take', 'Magnificant', 'Ambersons', 'not', 'only', 'redeem', 'Orson', 'Welles', '1942', 'vision', 'level', 'fundamental', 'storytelling.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'story.Boothe', 'Tarkington', 'novel', 'decline', 'land-wealthy', 'prestigious', 'Amberson', 'family', 'face', 'modernization', 'Industrial', 'Revolution', 'growth', 'middle', 'class', 'was', 'grand', 'American', 'tale.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'lack', 'money.The', 'production', 'had', 'lavish', 'budget', 'was', 'shot', 'old', 'estate', 'Ireland', 'expense', 'was', 'spared', 'constructing', 'set', 'looked', 'turn-of-the-century', 'Indianapolis.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'actors.The', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'included', 'such', 'talented', 'actors', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers.Arau', 'gave', 'most', 'too', 'little', 'do.In', 'role', 'Major', 'Amberson', 'Civil', 'War', 'veteran', 'made', 'good', 'land', 'speculation', 'Cromwell', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'insight', 'actions', 'past', 'Ambersons', 'how', 'led', 'warped', 'rigid', 'value', 'system', 'grandson', 'Georgie.Georgie', 'Minafer', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'supposed', 'have', 'charms', 'buffer', 'dark', 'tendencies', 'be', 'bigoted', 'narrow-minded', 'incestuous', 'brat', 'attention', 'defecit', 'disorder', 'always', 'flailing', 'about.His', 'character', 'never', 'move', 'one', 'whining', 'pouting', 'note.Thus', 'when', 'circumstances', 'force', 'change', 'part', 'change', 'wholely', 'implausible.Before', 'release', 'star', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'bemoaned', 'production', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'thing', 'do.In', 'hindsight', 'can', 'understand', 'complaint.Although', 'character', 'meant', 'charm', 'two', 'men', 'life', 'lost', 'love', 'youth', 'played', 'Greenwood', 'son', 'almost', 'robot-like.Stowe', 'complained', 'Arau', 'emphasized', 'incestous', 'tendency', 'Georgie', 'mother', 'Isabel', 'frankly', 'heat', 'sparks', 'kind', 'were', 'generated.Again', 'blame', 'Arau', 'have', 'seen', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'deliver', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'Gormenghast', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'lesser', 'known', 'Irish', 'gems', 'such', 'Michael', 'Collins', 'Disappearance', 'Finbar', 'recommend', 'rent', 'one']",N/A

Bernabo,"[19, 22]","Since the point of this version of ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" is to ""restore"" the scenes that were lost when the study cut the Orson Welles version from 148 to 88 minutes, it becomes impossible to judge it by a different standard in which we pretend this was the first time Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer Prize winning book was brought to the screen.  Ironically, if the point is to emphasize those lost scenes, then viewers need to watch the 1942 version to help you recognize the scenes when they crop up; they mostly have to do with the way modern things like the automobile change the face of the town in which the Ambersons rule.  Of course, most films suffer in comparison to the original Mercury Production.This 2002 production is handsome enough, although it lacks the distinctive cinematography and art direction of the Welles' film.  Bruce Greenwood cuts a suitably dashing figure as Eugene Morgan and Madeleine Stowe makes a tragic enough Isabel.  My problem with this version is the same as it was in the original: I can never really accept the idea that Lucy Morgan, well-played by the fetching Gretchen Mol, would ever really want to have anything to do with George Amberson Minafer, played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.  I will admit there are scenes in the later part of the film where Rhys-Meyers manages to find something charming in the character, and we do get into Lucy's thoughts on the matter at one point, but for the most part Georgie is played with such bug-eyed intensity that I find it impossible to believe his mother does not know her spoiled little brat is on a level all his own as a world-class jerk.  The film also goes a bit too far with suggesting some sort of Oedipus complex at work behind their relationship.  Isabel almost died giving him birth and could not have any more children; that is a reasonable enough explanation for what is going on here.Yes, Jennifer Tilly goes over the top as Aunt Fanny, but then when your performance is going to be compared to that of Agnes Moorhead, who received Best Actress honors from the New York Film Critics Circle of playing Fanny in the original, you are pretty much doomed.  James Cromwell has little of consequence to do as Major Amberson, but William Hootkins as Uncle George is a worthy successor to Ray Collins in the original.  He might be the black sheep of the Ambersons, but that means he simply ends up being the most grounded member of the clan.  However, it is from the performances of Greenwood and Mol that this version of ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" draws its strength.  The ending of the film, when Greenwood looks into the camera as he speaks the words of his imaginary letter to Isabel, is certainly more effective than the rather awkward ending of the original.  Anything that can end with such a note of grace deserves being watched.  Furthermore, those who have never seen the Welles' version will be able to better enjoy this film since they will not be prejudiced by memories of performances past.",4,"The ""restored"" version of the Orson Welles 1942 script",1013299200,"02 10, 2002",2002,2995,"['point', 'version', 'Magnificent', 'Ambersons', 'restore', 'scenes', 'were', 'lost', 'when', 'study', 'cut', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'version', '148', '88', 'minutes', 'impossible', 'judge', 'different', 'standard', 'pretend', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'Booth', 'Tarkington', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'book', 'was', 'brought', 'screen', 'Ironically', 'point', 'emphasize', 'lost', 'scenes', 'then', 'viewers', 'need', 'watch', '1942', 'version', 'help', 'recognize', 'scenes', 'when', 'crop', 'up', 'mostly', 'have', 'do', 'way', 'modern', 'things', 'automobile', 'change', 'face', 'town', 'Ambersons', 'rule', 'course', 'most', 'films', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'original', 'Mercury', 'Production.This', '2002', 'production', 'handsome', 'enough', 'distinctive', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'Welles', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'suitably', 'dashing', 'figure', 'Eugene', 'Morgan', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'tragic', 'enough', 'Isabel', 'problem', 'version', 'same', 'was', 'original', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'accept', 'idea', 'Lucy', 'Morgan', 'well-played', 'fetching', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'would', 'ever', 'really', 'want', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'George', 'Amberson', 'Minafer', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'will', 'admit', 'are', 'scenes', 'later', 'part', 'film', 'where', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'find', 'something', 'charming', 'character', 'do', 'get', 'Lucy', 'thoughts', 'matter', 'one', 'point', 'most', 'part', 'Georgie', 'played', 'such', 'bug-eyed', 'intensity', 'find', 'impossible', 'believe', 'mother', 'not', 'know', 'spoiled', 'little', 'brat', 'level', 'own', 'world-class', 'jerk', 'film', 'also', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'suggesting', 'sort', 'Oedipus', 'complex', 'work', 'relationship', 'Isabel', 'almost', 'died', 'giving', 'birth', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'more', 'children', 'reasonable', 'enough', 'explanation', 'what', 'going', 'here.Yes', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'top', 'Aunt', 'Fanny', 'then', 'when', 'performance', 'going', 'be', 'compared', 'Agnes', 'Moorhead', 'who', 'received', 'Best', 'Actress', 'honors', 'New', 'York', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Circle', 'playing', 'Fanny', 'original', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'doomed', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'little', 'consequence', 'do', 'Major', 'Amberson', 'William', 'Hootkins', 'Uncle', 'George', 'worthy', 'successor', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'original', 'might', 'be', 'black', 'sheep', 'Ambersons', 'simply', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'grounded', 'member', 'clan', 'However', 'performances', 'Greenwood', 'Mol', 'version', 'Magnificent', 'Ambersons', 'strength', 'ending', 'film', 'when', 'Greenwood', 'camera', 'words', 'imaginary', 'letter', 'Isabel', 'certainly', 'more', 'effective', 'rather', 'awkward', 'ending', 'original', 'Anything', 'can', 'end', 'such', 'note', 'grace', 'deserves', 'being', 'watched', 'Furthermore', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Welles', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'better', 'enjoy', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'prejudiced', 'memories', 'performances', 'past']",N/A

Here is a taste of it:""But Lucy who sat beside him lifted ineffable eyes from him [George] to her father, and shook her head.""`No, just take his hand--gently!'""She was radiant.""But for Eugene another radiance filled the room.  He knew that he had been true at last to his true love, and that through him she had brought her boy under shelter again.  Her eyes would look wistful no more.""What can one say about such leaden phrases as, ""ineffable eyes"" and ""true at last to his true love""?  That is weepy, inept pap.  The rest of the book is hardly better.On the assumption that this production does faithfully follow Orson Welles' 1942 shooting script, it is clear that he tightened up the book and made improvements throughout.  However, Tarkington's original sow's ear became no more than a much improved sow's ear.  The screenplay was no silk purse.Welles' movie of ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" mangled and mutilated though it is, retains about itself a tattered air of magnificense and--yes!--art that places it far above the book and even the screenplay.  It has an ensemble feeling that dates back to the old Mercury Theater days.  The uniformly excellent actors, all united in style and goal, were ""One equal temper of heroic hearts,"" as Tennyson might have said.  The film's overall design and cinematography achieved something far beyond anything that Tarkington might have imagined.  And more important than any of that, although much more subtle, is the unique, pervasive and unmistakable presence of Orson Welles--that truly ineffable man.In 1943, the hacked up studio version of the film won academy awards for Agnes Moorehead as best supporting actress, for best black-and-white art direction and interior decoration, for best black-and-white cinematography (Stanley Cortez) and for best picture.Now we come to this TV movie.  It offers only the original screenplay, none of the rest--and in bland TV color, yet!  The net effect is similar to that of attempting to reproduce the Mona Lisa on an Etch-A-Sketch.  What were they thinking?This new TV movie arose out of a mediocre conception and was executed by mediocre talents to achieve a mediocre goal.

To me, the biggest problem is a few obnoxious performances, despite a pretty promising cast.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I present to you one Jonathon Rhyes Meyers, and one Jennifer Tilly.  They are charged with ruining a potentially good film with thier thoroughly unlikeable characters,  strained delivery of lines,  and horribly overdone accents.  Jennifer Tilly looks like a puppet with a flapping jaw reciting lines in a loud screaching voice.  Jonathon Rhyes Meyers' character is so cocky, so over the top selfish, that I couldn't muster any concern for him at all, nor for all of the other characters who seem to just find him determined and proud.  It is hard to care about a story when you can not care about the characters. This is the position I found myself in as I watched this movie.  I also thought the movie looked a little low-budget and amatuer-ish.  The hair and makeup were also really overdone for the time period.

Jonathan Rhys-Meyers has been excellent in other movies I have seen, but his acting in this is so overblown and forced it is painful to watch, and I am not using this wording frivolously.  There were actually a couple of points during the movie where the acting was so pathetic I could not look at the screen...much like pretending to not notice when someone slips on the ice, just to save you both from the embarrassment.  Rhys-Meyers' good looks did nothing to take my attention from his terrible performance.Gretchen Mol's performance was wooden and with a plastic smile plastered over her face during most of the movie, she seems to simply be walking her way through the movie, as if she can't wait for the ""Cut!"" so she can make a break for the caterer's buffet.  Madeline Stowe's performance was acceptable as Rhys-Meyers' mother, but not up to her usual standards.  Jennifer Tilly gave her Aunt Fannie character a valiant try, but she is terribly miscast and could not seem to find it within herself to even produce tears during any of her apoplectic fits.I am SO disappointed in this movie.

686052,A26KPG4EY0JLXM,B00005UW73,Philip A. Kraus,"[18, 24]","Let's face it; Orson Welles's movie of The Magnificent Ambersons is a magnificent mess through no fault of its highly regarded director. Cut and edited to pieces by studio hacks (Robert Wise!!!) with the excised material now lost, the movie exists as a mere torso rather than a whole experience. So much is missing, that the movie is hard to follow unless you've read the book. The movie is certainly not what Welles wanted and it is unrepairable; a great tragedy in film history.The new version from A&E; may not have Welles's unique directorial ability or atmospheric lighting in black and white, but it does tell Tarkington's story coherently and on the whole, quite successfully. Director Alfonso Arau has purposely avoided the look of the Welles film, opting for a rich, epic color palette. The art direction is beautiful and you really get a flavor of turn of the century midwest American life.Many reviewers have complained of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers performance of George. Frankly it is a brave and quite accurate portrayal. Tim Holt in the Welles film was hopelessly too mature looking to play Tarkington's headstrong brat. Georgie is not a very sympathetic character in the book and Rhys-Meyers studiously avoids turning him into the bland leading man that Welles allowed Holt to portray. Those that take issue with Rhys-Meyers don't know the book. He is the right age and certainly the right look for this difficult character. He is a dynamic actor that isn't afraid to be true to a character's inate nature. He's not easy to take at times, but Georgie isn't either!Many have also criticized Jennifer Tilly's Fanny as not being the equal of Agnes Moorehead. Again, Tilly is closer to the book. Fanny is a hapless character which Tilly invests with a wonderful degree of humanity coupled with her unique brand of eccentricity. Moorehead had not an ounce of charm and frankly was miscast. Madeleine Stowe, James Cromwell, and Bruce Greenwood are all excellent as are the supporting players.Is this the ultimate version of this classic. Of course not. It is, however, a well made, BBC style television movie that is very true to Tarkington's novel and tells the story clearly, unapologetically and with some amount of panache.

The themes are interesting -- the passing of an era with the coming of the motor car, class snobbery, etc.The actors were mostly quite good and very watchable.  I loved Bruce Greenwood, especially, from the first scene---he's handsome, charming, buoyant, jovial, and good-hearted-- a true romantic hero.  Gretchen Mol, as his sunny, beautiful daughter appears to have grown up in the same family as her father, given her extremely happy personality.  (When you're watching something as long as this is, it's vital to like the folks you're looking at!)The photography is good.  Some shots are a little overly arty for my taste but it didn't really bother me.  I enjoyed the opening snowy scene with the horse-drawn carriages pulling up to the mansion--ah the good life--while it lasted!  The ballroom scenes are fun, many of the indoor scenes are rich with interesting detail.  (When you're watching something this long, it's important to like the stuff you're looking at...)The one thing that bothered me enough to subtract two stars from my rating was the ""phenomenon"" of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as George Minifer.  I haven't seen Rhys-Meyers in any other films so I don't know if it was his fault or if it was that of the director...but I found him so unpleasant to watch that it soured the whole experience for me.  I want to read the book to see how it was handled in the original.  Here, there is no hint of any goodness in this horrible fellow, which makes his final ""redemption"" highly unlikely.It's also really, really unbelievable that a young woman as beautiful, happy and bright as Lucy (and with such a good father!) could possibly fall for such a creep.  I didn't find him in the least good looking, with his perpetual sneer and snobby voice.  The fact that he was let to develop in such an extremely anti-social way didn't make sense among this family that seemed otherwise to be quite sensible.I agree, too, that the erotic stuff between Georgie and Isabel seems gratuitous and rather creepy.

Set in late 1880s, film is full of sensuality and beautiful costumes peppered by restrained mannerisms of the period.  Main story is about Amberson family who has made their money in real estate.  They are old money and they know it.  Isabel Amberson is a beautiful woman who chooses ""safe"" husband. Reliable and dull he is her safety net in the world she is so accustomed to.  Their only son George is her one and only passion in her life. The two are inseparable  and their co-dependency leads to almost incestuous relationship between overprotective mother and spoiled and jealous son.  Death of Isabel's husband makes their relationship even more complicated.  In order to restrain potential suitors from taking his beloved mother away from him, her son takes her on the indefinitely long trip around the world - until, too late, he discovers that his mother is gravely ill.  Surrounding characters: Isabel's own brother and father, her sister-in-law Fanny and her flame from her youth Eugene Morgan all make interesting characters, but are all incapable of ensuring some distance between mother and her son.  As family shrinks due to death and fortunes disappear due to Amberson family's inability to adjust to the new times, we see young George Amberson - spoiled, arrogant, jealous and overbearing grow to learn to be kind and caring, responsible and strong since his world of protection and privilege disappears right before his eyes.  This is one of those great family sagas, deep psychological exploration of human relationships at times when world to women was a closed one - when they were vitual property of their sons and husbands, where class determined one's future in terms of their profession, marriage prospectsability to prosepr thru strong social connections.

Most of the time, a person feels inclined to take the main character's side, but in this case, I definitely felt like he was a rather disagreeable character up until the end.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was an excellent villian/hero.  His poor mother, played by Madeleine Stowe, was constantly bullied by her overbearing, selfish, and extremely arrogant son.  In fact, he bullied just about everyone who came into contact with him.  His Uncle George puts it well towards the end of the film, &quot;Georgie, I have always been fond of you, but I haven't always liked you.&quot;  While this film is rather bittersweet, it's definitely something worth watching.  It's interesting to see what happpens to a young man who has always had the best of everything and then when his grandfather dies, realizes that he has to live like the people he used to see and call &quot;riffraff.&quot;  It's about this time he seems to develop some sort of conscience about his past actions and how he treats others.  It's a slow realization, but he does come to it.  I think this film actually shows how many people of that rank felt at the time, that their wealth would last forever and they need never work for it.  Many of them lost almost everything later on when the older family members, who had been the only ones dealing with the finances, finally died and are quick to find that there is nothing left except debts that can't be paid.

Unfortunately, this is an insipid interpretation of Welles' version of the novel, with some full-bloodedly bad acting by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Jennifer Tilly.  Some truly embarrassing scenes between the two of them made me wince.  Any actor who'd like a lesson in how NOT to act should watch these two go at it here.Madeline Stowe and Bruce Greenwood, taking the roles originally played by Dolores Costello and Joseph Cotten, are not at all bad, but they don't have half the charm and chemistry of the originals (although with better direction, they might have had this).  Two stars for their performances, particularly Bruce Greenwood, and, for Gretchen Mol as Lucy.What especially made me wince was the director's outpour of what should be only gently hinted:  the quasi-incestuous murmur between Isabel and young George.  George undresses in front of his mother; takes her face in his hands and kisses her lips, etc.  And Isabel's death scene is just way, way over the top.  Just gross, really.Poor Orson Welles --in 1942, his original film got chopped up by studio hacks, and now a hack job using Welles' shooting script despoils it even further; gracing it with (some) bad performances, and flat direction.
