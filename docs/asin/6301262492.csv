248478,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301262492,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Despite a slightly dated feel to the film, there is very little to complain about when considering `Running on Empty', an 80's family drama that revolves around fugitives (from the law) who are struggling to stay `hidden' when their son starts trying to establish roots.  It certainly feels very `80's', but that really isn't as much a negative as could be assumed.  The film is still very moving and involved and certainly maintains a level of poignancy, even today.`Running on Empty' tells the story of the Pope family.  The parents, Annie and Arthur, have been hiding from a past they are proud of yet eternally haunted by.  In the 60's, both Annie and Arthur set a weapons lab on fire in an attempt to hinder the government's involvement with the Vietnam War.  For years they have been altering their identities and popping in and out of cities in order to stay one step ahead of the authorities who are hot on their trail.  The Popes run into a snag when their eldest son, Danny, wants to have a real life, separated from that of his parents and their constant running away.  He is a talented musician who wants to attend Julliard.  He has met a girl who he feels he's in love with.  The point is that Danny is tired of running, but he is well aware that his decision would mean a drastic shakeup in his family dynamic.If he stays, he'll never see his parents or his brother again.Thanks to a steady and rather intimate direction by Sidney Lumet, `Running on Empty' feels very personal in areas where it could have felt distant or fragmented.  Instead, the audience truly feels a part of this family and they especially feel close to and or sympathetic towards Danny.  It's sad that the same attention isn't really given to the parents, since this is equally their story and it could have really been stirring to `feel' alongside them the same way we feel alongside Danny.  But, in the end this is majorly Danny's story (Phoenix's Supporting Actor Oscar nomination was a total joke...he isn't `supporting' anybody...this is HIS movie) and so it is with Danny that we invest most of our attention.  Thankfully, River Phoenix was (RIP) an extraordinary actor and his talents shine thoroughly here.  He really transports us into Danny's life and shows us who he is, inside and out.The rest of cast is also very good; especially Steven Hill who only has ONE scene (he plays Donald, Annie's father), but it is easily the most gut-wrenching scene in the film and his performance shines the brightest for me (even over Phoenix!).  What he brings to that one scene...the emotional honesty...it's just crippling.So, I totally recommend this film.  It is beautifully acted and really flows with a sense of urgency that helps the audience become wrapped up in every frame.  It has aged rather well, so while it isn't perfect it certainly maintains a value that many films lose over time.",4,It runs well...,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,2881,"['slightly', 'dated', 'feel', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'complain', 'when', 'considering', 'Running', 'Empty', '80', 'family', 'drama', 'fugitives', 'law', 'who', 'are', 'struggling', 'stay', 'hidden', 'when', 'son', 'trying', 'establish', 'roots', 'certainly', 'very', '80', 'really', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'negative', 'could', 'be', 'assumed', 'film', 'still', 'very', 'moving', 'involved', 'certainly', 'level', 'poignancy', 'even', 'today.', 'Running', 'Empty', 'story', 'Pope', 'family', 'parents', 'Annie', 'Arthur', 'have', 'been', 'hiding', 'past', 'are', 'proud', 'yet', 'eternally', 'haunted', '60', 'Annie', 'Arthur', 'set', 'weapons', 'lab', 'fire', 'attempt', 'hinder', 'government', 'involvement', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'altering', 'identities', 'popping', 'cities', 'order', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'authorities', 'who', 'are', 'hot', 'trail', 'Popes', 'run', 'snag', 'when', 'eldest', 'son', 'Danny', 'have', 'real', 'life', 'separated', 'parents', 'constant', 'running', 'away', 'talented', 'musician', 'who', 'attend', 'Julliard', 'met', 'girl', 'who', 'love', 'point', 'Danny', 'tired', 'running', 'well', 'aware', 'decision', 'would', 'mean', 'drastic', 'shakeup', 'family', 'dynamic.If', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'parents', 'brother', 'again.Thanks', 'steady', 'rather', 'intimate', 'direction', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'Running', 'Empty', 'feels', 'very', 'personal', 'areas', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'felt', 'distant', 'fragmented', 'Instead', 'audience', 'truly', 'part', 'family', 'especially', 'feel', 'close', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'Danny', 'sad', 'same', 'attention', ""n't"", 'really', 'given', 'parents', 'equally', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'stirring', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'feel', 'alongside', 'Danny', 'end', 'majorly', 'Danny', 'story', 'Phoenix', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'was', 'total', 'joke', ""n't"", 'supporting', 'anybody', 'HIS', 'movie', 'Danny', 'invest', 'most', 'attention', 'Thankfully', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'RIP', 'extraordinary', 'actor', 'talents', 'shine', 'thoroughly', 'here', 'really', 'Danny', 'life', 'who', 'inside', 'out.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'who', 'only', 'ONE', 'scene', 'Donald', 'Annie', 'father', 'easily', 'most', 'gut-wrenching', 'scene', 'film', 'performance', 'brightest', 'even', 'Phoenix', 'What', 'one', 'scene', 'emotional', 'honesty', 'just', 'crippling.So', 'totally', 'recommend', 'film', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'really', 'sense', 'urgency', 'audience', 'become', 'wrapped', 'up', 'frame', 'aged', 'rather', 'well', 'so', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'certainly', 'value', 'many', 'films', 'lose', 'time']",N/A

248480,ARA48345JZPZR,6301262492,Archmaker,"[11, 12]","This movie about 70's radicals living life underground and on-the-run with their two sons in tow, after their bombing of a napalm factory resulted in the paralysis and blinding of a janitor who wasn't supposed to be there, is actually a unique and beautifully told family drama, with a superbly chosen cast and some very fine writing to commend it.River Phoenix plays the oldest son Danny, who is a gifted pianist and is old enough to begin resisting the fugitive life that has been thrust on him, Jonas Abry as his little brother, Christine Lahti as his beautiful mother and Judd Hirsch as his still true-believer father.  The details of how they live their lives underground, ready to run at any instant, working the gray areas of the economy for cash as fry cook or receptionist or whatever is convincing.  Yet they have a warm and rich family life.Although the events and situations that bring enormous stress into this family, fracturing what has been a functioning, albeit odd, modus operandi revolve around the rise of the undeniable talent of Danny and his desire to pursue his own dreams, it is also a result of the numbing strain of 17 years on the run that is felt especially by Lahti's Annie.  A once Julliard-caliber musician, like her son, she threw her life away with her ""act of conscience"".  The resolution of all this rings true.If for no other reason, this movie is worth seeing for one scene, which I consider one of the finest moments by two actors ever captured on film, and that is the scene between Christine Lahti and Steven Hill as her father.  This brief meeting in a very high class New York restaraunt with the fugitive daughter and her prominent industrialist father, who hasn't seen or heard from her in many years, is gut-wrenching, heart-breaking, devastatingly honest and about as ""true"" a moment by both actors as I have ever seen.  It is remarkable.There are many good scenes in this film, and Sidney Lumet elicits superb performances here as he always seems to do in his best work.

248481,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6301262492,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Running on Empty is about a family on the run. Annie and Arthur Pope (Christine Lahti and Judd Hirsch) are political activists who have bombed a napalm factory to protest the Viet Nam war. Though it was 17 years ago, and the war is over, the FBI is still searching for them. Their two boys, Danny & Harry (River Phoenix and Jonas Abry) have lived their whole lives on the run, There is an incredibly tight family bond, but it is tested when Danny shows great musical talent and his music teacher tries to get him to go to Julliard. Plus, he is falling for his teacher's daughter, Lorna Phillips (Martha Plimpton). Danny's mother, Annie, was also musically talented, but she had to give up her dreams of Julliard and a career in music for their fugitive life. She doesn't want the same thing to happen to Danny, but it would mean that she and the family could never see him.River Phoenix did an excellent job in this film, and was nominated for an Oscar. He was uniquely qualified for this, as his own family was also very tight, and at one point they all went to South America when their parents joined a religious cult. In spite of what his parents put him through, they had a tight family bond, and he always remained loyal to his family.Also, Phoenix was very involved in music. This offered him tons of insight into his character, Danny. He felt really strongly about his character, at one point he was supposed to be caught playing classical music, and embarrassed, switch to something jazzy. River argued that his character would never be embarrassed about his music, and director Sidney Lumet made the change. He does, however, throw in a jazzy ending when showing his music teacher Mr. Phillips (Ed Crowley) that he can play, but it is not out of embarrassment. In the scenes where he is playing, it looks like it is actually River Phoenix playing. Though a professional player may have dubbed in the music, his fingers appear to be hitting the correct keys. Whether or not he was actually playing, he shows remarkable emotional range and sensitivity in his acting. River Phoenix was born to play this role, and his untimely death was so tragic, like James Dean's or Heath Ledger's.Director Sidney Lumet has made a great number of movies, often with a politically left stance. This movie is more about the consequences and the effects of political actions on the family. Whether or not it was the right thing to do is a question that remains unsettled. There is still a lot of anguish over what happened, because a janitor who was not supposed to be there, according to their plan, was seriously injured. And when a radical from their past shows up to ask them to partake in a bank robbery, they reject him and any involvement with guns. This movie doesn't preach about politics too much. It is more about family. One of the most wrenching scenes is when Annie meets with her father, who she has barely seen for 15 years.All of the actors are good in this drama, but River Phoenix really stands out, and I liked Martha Plimpton a lot. Judd Hirsch did a great job as the fugitive father. He is very familiar from the TV program Taxi, where he played cab driver Alex Reiger. That show had a lasting impact, due to him and other cast members such as Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and the wildly eccentric Andy Kaufman. Judd Hirsch was in another sit com called Dear John that some might remember, or currently he can be seen as the father of a math professor and an FBI agent who team up to solve crimes on Numb3rs. On one episode they all watch TV and he makes popcorn as they watch, what else, a re-run of Taxi. According to his bio, he does have a degree in Physics. Perhaps it qualifies as irony that in Running on Empty he is running from the FBI, but on Numb3rs, his son is an FBI agent?The family moment that stands out for me in Running On Empty is when they all sing along to You've Got a Friend by James Taylor. They also sing Happy Birthday, which they had to obtain the rights to use. Madonna and Roy Orbinson are also heard from, but for some reason, they didn't use Jackson Browne's Running on Empty, though it would have been perfect for the beginning or end, roll the credits.TEN FILMS THAT PERTAIN TO THE ACTORS OR DIRECTOR OF RUNNING ON EMPTYSneakers(1992) .... Carl Arbegast was portrayed by River Phoenix.My Own Private Idaho(1991) .... Mike Waters was one of River's best roles, and he became very close friends with both Keanu Reeves and director Gus Van Zant.Dogfight(1991) .... Eddie Birdlace is a marine about to ship out to Viet Nam in 1963.Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade - Widescreen Edition(1989) .... After playing Young Indy he became very close friends with Harrison Ford.The Mosquito Coast(1986) .... Charlie Fox was played by River in another award winning performance. Martha Plimpton played Emily Spellgood. Besides Plimpton, this movie is also like Running on Empty as it concerns a father who uproots his family to follow him on a quixotic quest. This time, the father is played by Harrison Ford, who has said that this is his favorite film, of all that he's done.Stand By Me (Special Edition)(1986) .... Chris Chambers was played by River in another award winning performance.King Of The Gypsies(1978) .... Judd Hirsch is Groffo, the King of the Gypsies, and Eric Roberts plays his son. Brooke Shields is also in this film.Ordinary People(1980) .... Judd Hirsch played Dr. Tyrone C. Berger in this Oscar winning family drama.Daniel(1983) .... Directed by Sidney Lumet, this is the most similar to Running on Empty, as it concerns a son trying to find out what happened to his parents who were convicted of being communist spies. But instead of going for the emotion, the son is rather aloof, and the movie is less effective.Network(1976) This Sidney Lumet film takes a whole different approach to radical politics. In this one, the TV Networks are encouraging terrorism because they are getting great ratings. A very black comedy that targets the media's role.Arthur Pope: Now, go out there and make a difference.

Judd Hirsch and Christine Lahti play the husband and wife and River Phoenix and Jonas Abry are their kids.There is excellent acting in this film and particularly by young Phoenix. The story shows us a good portrait of what it must be like to live in hiding. Politically, people will view this movie as they think (conservative or liberal) because it could be viewed a number of ways.To me, it showed the worst of what could have happened to young people in the '60s who believed they were doing the right thing but broke the law....and paid the consequence. The sad part, as this shows so vividly, is how it affects the rest of the family and others.I think the most powerful scene in the film is when Lahti meets her dad after 14 years in hiding: very, very emotional stuff and one of the most intense short scenes I've ever seen on film.",5,"A Well-Acted, Powerful Story",1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,1105,"['thought', 'was', 'powerful', 'movie', ""'60s"", 'radicals', 'lam', '14', 'years', 'crisis', 'when', 'family', '17-year-old', 'son', 'talented', 'enough', 'enter', 'Juliard', 'School', 'Music', 'identity', 'problems', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'play', 'husband', 'wife', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Jonas', 'Abry', 'are', 'kids.There', 'excellent', 'acting', 'film', 'particularly', 'young', 'Phoenix', 'story', 'good', 'portrait', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'live', 'hiding', 'Politically', 'people', 'will', 'view', 'movie', 'think', 'conservative', 'liberal', 'could', 'be', 'viewed', 'number', 'ways.To', 'showed', 'worst', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'young', 'people', ""'60s"", 'who', 'believed', 'were', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'broke', 'law', '.and', 'paid', 'consequence', 'sad', 'part', 'so', 'vividly', 'how', 'rest', 'family', 'others.I', 'think', 'most', 'powerful', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'Lahti', 'dad', '14', 'years', 'hiding', 'very', 'very', 'emotional', 'stuff', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'short', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film']",N/A
248483,AVCRD98TH48RN,6301262492,D. Knouse,"[4, 5]","It was my senior year when this film first hit the screens, and little did I know that I was about to witness one of the finest actors of my generation, River Phoenix, give the best performance of his career.  He simply shines here, with so many touching moments that recalling them all has me overwhelmed with admiration and sadness.  Seldom does any actor achieve this high a level of acting genious, let alone at River's young age.  His performance here is truly remarkable, and I recommend owning this film for his work alone.  But there is certainly more here to see.  Judd Hirsch, of &quot;Taxi&quot; fame, is solid as River's father and shows both compassion and fortitude.  Martha Plimpton, also in &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; with River Phoenix, is intelligent and plays off River's character so well that one can see the amazing chemistry they have written on the screen.  But the other excellent performance here belongs to Christine Lahti.  Her character is supportive of her family, but so many years on the run from the F.B.I. has made her weary.  In every scene she has she shows an underlying fatigue that is breaking her down, even as she tries to hold on to her family as it begins to fracture.  There is one scene, in particular, when she arranges &quot;through the network&quot; to see her father.  She hasn't seen him in 14 years, the last when she was a young idealistic woman wanting to change the world and now a mother on the run trying to do what's best for her family.  Her and her father exchange at least ten differnet emotions during the short scene, ultimately making it one of the most genuine moments in the movie.  That's what this movie is, &quot;geniune.&quot;  All the characters are believably realistic and likable.  It is truly a great experience when I care about every character in a film, and that happened here.  The final scene is extraordinarily sad; and it was more so seeing River Phoenix standing alone with tears in his eyes.  He was such a tremendous talent, and this film gives ample examples as to the genious of his craft.

248485,AAU7CAQIN5BAE,6301262492,"EliteLamo ""too weird to live, too rare to die""","[3, 3]","So yeah, I have wanted for sometime to review this movie. I was around 11 or so when I first saw it with my mother. I remember trying to hold back tears at the final scene, when Judd drives away in the car, and I couldn't. I was so hiding back the huge lump in my throat and the water in the corners of my eyes, but I did regardless; and I knew then, that movies, beyond all conceivable recognition, can shape, mold and understand who we are really. That scene evokes every emotion any man can muster, and if it doesn't well, then perhaps a little head examining is in order. Why can't these movies get more appreciation than they do, (of 314 reviews, 212 people gave Travolta's Face off Five Stars, sigh)During the early years of River, and not to long before Empty, when he was in Stand By Me and the absolutely remarkably engaging 'Mosquito Coast', a little gem called ""Running On Empty"" found its way into some people's hearts. Now I am not one for definitive research. I know what I know (and that's not very much) and I just go with the flow from watching the films, rather than doing research on them. With that being said, I must tell you that I wish, especially in this day and age, more films were made with such sincerity and such magic, that we, as movie lovers, can see some of the actors we may or may not know very well and completely and utterly come out and dance with their talents, and this movie here, this one that you should buy instantly, is such a film.Christine Lahti knows how to play a mom perfectly, she screams mother in all her warmth and tenderness, and still manages to understand the complexity of teenage life, as only a real mother could. The added duress the boys and her are under is so present in her moods, her actions, her on screen stress reactions to given situations, you can feel this struggle building up in every part of the film [especially the absolutely remarkable scene where she meets her father in the restaurant for lunch, and I must say I was hypnotized and choked up and this chemistry, this magic wonderment that every teenager dreaming of acting and to be 40 feet tall on the big screen should watch and learn from this. They play off each other so well, and even though the scene is what, less than a few minutes, you are instantly transported into both their heartache and understand what they are both going through, instantly]. I consider one of the greatest scenes in the history of film, ahhh Lumet... That, my friend, that in its estatic boldness, is what I believe the essential craft of two people playing off each other is about.I can sit sometimes in a theatre, and want to reach out for some actors and shake them this way and that and to and fro, and tell them, ""come on, I know you have more than that upstairs...""Judd Hirsh is superb as the stand-offish, domineering father, who's most important intrinsic belief is sticking together. If they are not cohesive in their building block of family, than they are nothing. Nothing without each other. They must be one, they must be complete, for one entity to let go is for a piece of the puzzle to be missing, and that, in his world, is utterly unacceptable, at all cost. You can see that wall, that brick foundation if you will, slowly and surely break down throughout the film, yet done graduely and professionally. What great understanding Sidney Lumet has with his actors. I wonder how many takes were, ""Ok Judd, Ok Christine, River, just go with your emotions...see where it takes you."" I am sure quite a few. In one scene in particular, River and Judd exchange very odd dialouge in regards to him sleeping with (Lorna) Ms. Plimpton; River is straight forward and direct to his father, and you can tell by both of their demeanor that River has lied to him before, and it was not accepted well. To be able to write that in a review, and to get that from a film, to predict in this imaginary world in which we are allowed to view, what happened to these characters in younger years and at odd intervals in their thwarted lives, shows me how painstakingly beautiful the world of cinema can be; either that or I need to up my lithium. :)It is a shame to know what 'could have' been for River. The Academy sure understood this pure, refined, magical talent in Mr. Phoenix. It's one of those small time movies that shows a roll can move mountains, similar to that of Leo's nomination in ""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape."" That sort of 'breakthrough' role that set them on pace with some of the greats.I once set eyes on Juilliard, I dreamt of it and believed in myself so much. I told everyone I was going there regardless of where the road led. To know Danny's (River's) dream to defy all conventional odds and be great at his fingered gift, and see this dream spilled out to us in his minds eye and have it, essentially, become reality, really hits home. I envied him.It is not often a film can make me cry and cry and think and dream and wonder, and realize how amazing life can be if we truly put our hearts into something. Maybe I am stretching this a bit far, but if you have never seen this film, and I understand there are many who have not, I implore you with every joint I can muster, buy it, watch it, delve into its magic, let it open your heart and tug at it for a bit, and let it sit there on your shelf, next to the classics, next to the tear jerkers, and allow it to magically pull you in too, as it did me, over and over again.Cheers.KenP.S. keith right on: ""He was an actor whose tank never would have run out."" --Keith Simanton",5,"A film to grow, laugh, cry and live by, eviscerated my

This is just what they've become accustomed to, even constantly living under aliases, but high school senior Danny has never really had a chance to be a kid or to freely pursue his love of the piano (but somehow still manages to always have his practice board nearby as if it's his security blanket), so every chance he gets, he becomes a kid again, whether it's putting on a showbiz hat, playing air guitar, hiking in the woods, or running on the beach, because that makes him happy (the movie also paints a beautiful picture of its setting in New Jersey, something rarely seen in movies and TV, since New Jersey is usually jokingly referred to as unappealing).  And, of course, the piano also makes Danny happy, with his obvious talent and general music appreciation passed down from his Mom (Danny is the only one in his class who knows the technical difference between pop and classical music).  His parents finally realize this, that Danny can't possibly be happy on the lam, even when Danny says he'd rather stay with them as high school graduation nears and Danny sneaks off to audition to get into prestigious Juilliard, just like his Mom had planned and dreamed to do, though, of course, her plans never materialized.  In fact, in the movie's best scene among many, Annie feels that it's best to ask her Dad (Steven Hill, ""Law and Order""), Danny's Grandfather, from whom she's estranged and has hardly seen for a couple of decades (except for fleeting meetings in airports and restaurants in order to elude the FBI), to take Danny in, and as Annie's Dad says, it's very ironic that these are Annie's wishes since she abandoned that same life, leaving her own parents behind.  Danny's life is at a crossroads:  He loves his family too much to leave them, but he's an adult now with new girlfriend ""Lorna"" (Martha Plimpton, TV's ""Raising Hope"") and relatives out there he hardly knows (you have to see the movie to see how he arranges to see his only surviving Grandma while painstakingly not being able to tell her who he is, for fear of blowing his parents' cover and losing them in the process).

In this tale about a family on the run from the law, the three leads register strong, memorable performances.  The late River Phoenix is excellent, and he earned a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for this role, which was to be a highlight of his tragically short career.On this DVD, the movie is presented in full frame (square, as in not letterboxed), which may be disappointing to some.  However, &quot;Running on Empty&quot; was initially shot full frame (or &quot;flat&quot;) on 35mm and later matted to a 1:85 aspect ratio for theatrical release -- a common practice for a lot of films, including such big budget movies like &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future.&quot;  When presented as full frame on television, the viewer is actually getting more of the image that was originally photographed than they would be if it were letterboxed.That being said, film aficionados would've appreciated a widesreen DVD presentation that would've simulated the theatrical version.  Plus, a widescreen DVD can be anamorphically enhanced for viewing on HD or HD-enhanced sets.At the time of its original release, &quot;Running on Empty&quot; received critical praise and numerous awards, but the DVD has the scantest of bonus materials. (Interestingly, its screenwriter, Naomi Foner, is the mother of actors Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal.)

This stems from the parents staging a bomb attack on a Napalm factory in their protest of the Vietnam War coupled with a factory worker getting seriously injured in the process.  Always on the move, changing identities, and having no semblance of stability in their lives, the Popes gradually become weary of the chase and are forced to question their beliefs on family unity, which is paramount to them.  Settling in New Jersey after yet another close call with authorities, Annie Pope enrolls her son in a local high school where his talent for playing the piano is quickly noticed and appreciated by his music teacher.  So much so that arrangements are put into motion for Danny to attend the Julliard School of Music on a scholarship.  Arthur and Annie Pope, kept out of the loop, eventually learn of these plans plus Danny's evolving relationship with his music teacher's daughter and his fervent desire to act on the scholarship.  The Pope family is forced to examine their lives, their beliefs, and their convictions regarding the impending consequences of finally breaking the family circle.  This leads up to a very moving and poignant climax in the movie that is nothing short of outstanding.As many reviewers have already stated, the quality of the acting in this movie is absolutely stellar.  Christine Lahti, Judd Hirsch, River Phoenix, and Martha Plimpton render such heartfelt performances that they appear to be a real family in the real world.  Although River Phoenix was nominated for an Oscar (rightly so and he was a phenomenal talent), everyone mentioned above deserved a nomination probably just as much.  Each time I watch Running On Empty, which is frequently, I always think of how River Phoenix's career would have had a meteoric rise and how much more pleasure he would have brought to movie audiences.Running On Empty is an ideal example of drama at its very best.  In regards to emotional impact, this movie pushes all your buttons from start to finish.  You'll want to laugh and cry and eventually you'll realize just how deep love, commitment, understanding, forgiveness, and hope really run in a family.

248492,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,6301262492,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[9, 9]","One of the best things about this film is found in the details. When Judd Hirsch, as the patriarch of a family constantly on the run from the FBI, throws a couple of vegetables to his son played by River Phoenix, the director, Sidney Lumet, doesn't use that old cut trick--one hand throwing, another hand catching. He actually has River catch the stuff that's thrown to him. When River plays the piano, Lumet doesn't cut away from the keyboard to show the actor's face, then cut again to the sight of hands playing. He shows River playing the piano. It's a real pity River's not here anymore. He had gallons of talent.This is a film whose emotional base is rock solid because the characters are flesh and blood, with real feelings--warmth, dignity, fear, and hope--that give the story tremendous depth and substance.One sidenote of interest. The young actor who plays the younger son in the family, Jonas Abry, was coached for this film by my mother who is a children's acting coach. (He does a great job, if I do say so myself!)Everyone in the cast is fine, but the two standouts are River Phoenix and Christine Lahti. As Judd Hirsch's wife, she is not only perfectly cast, but fits her role like a hand in a kid glove. You can't see anyone else doing this as well. Maybe Sissy Spacek, but this unique combination of toughness and warmth is not quite a Spacek character--nor is it quite a Jodie Foster character either. It's Lahti's role all the way and she's really great.One of the best things about this DVD is that it's really inexpensive.

All the performances here - Christine Lahti, Judd Hirsch, Martha Plimpton, Steven Hill et al - are standouts. The direction by Sidney Lumet is gentle and observant, the script by Naomi Foner subtle and honest.While the entire film is engaging and poignant, particularly memorable is the birthday dinner scene, where brilliant use is made of James Taylor's Fire and Rain.

I got this off amazon.com a few years ago and through the years, I have lost the interest I initially had for this movie, but it's still great - specially the scene between the mother and her own father.",3,Running on Empty,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,573,"['got', 'off', 'Netflix', 'was', 'caught', 'up', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'learned', ""'d"", 'been', 'nominated', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'role', 'here', 'scene', 'mother', 'grandfather', 'tore', 'up', 'when', 'offered', 'let', 'boy', 'go', 'reasons', 'why', 'teary', 'admissions', 'defiance', 'first', 'then', 'when', 'got', 'up', 'go', 'own', 'emotions', 'coming', 'got', 'off', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'years', 'have', 'lost', 'interest', 'initially', 'had', 'movie', 'still', 'great', 'specially', 'scene', 'mother', 'own', 'father']",N/A

I've read that this actually gives you MORE visual data than the theatrical version (as the film was supposedly originally shot in full-screen and then had the top and bottom of the screen lopped-off in theatrical rectangular shape -- and was presumably shot with this intention. And as such, the full-screen version is as good or better than what we'd get from a widescreen format.)Turns out that all of the above is not true. The full-screen version is in fact Uber-cropped.At any rate, despite the miscasting of Judd Hirsch as the ex-'60s-radical-turned-father, the movie itself is one of those rarefied things that's so good it tends to escape hype --- or even adequate attention. The drama is understated and River Phoenix is as gulp-inducing as ever.Sad, sad, sad...",5,DVD format,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,824,"['DVD', 'only', 'available', 'now', '1.33', 'full-screen', ""'ve"", 'read', 'actually', 'MORE', 'visual', 'data', 'theatrical', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'supposedly', 'originally', 'shot', 'full-screen', 'then', 'had', 'top', 'bottom', 'screen', 'lopped-off', 'theatrical', 'rectangular', 'shape', 'was', 'presumably', 'shot', 'intention', 'such', 'full-screen', 'version', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'what', ""'d"", 'get', 'widescreen', 'format', 'out', 'above', 'not', 'true', 'full-screen', 'version', 'fact', 'Uber-cropped.At', 'rate', 'miscasting', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', ""ex-'60s-radical-turned-father"", 'movie', 'one', 'rarefied', 'things', 'so', 'good', 'escape', 'hype', 'even', 'adequate', 'attention', 'drama', 'understated', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'as', 'gulp-inducing', 'ever.Sad', 'sad', 'sad']",N/A
