I happen to have British relatives, and it was very distracting to hear Arslan speak with what is considered to be oa low class accent in Great Britan.  He's a prince right?  Oh well.The animation was great and a few of the battle sequences were also nice, but there still seems to be something missing from the film.  An ending might be part of it.  But I also seemed to sense a lack of comradery.  The Lodoss War characters had a better sense of friendship.If you like epic medieval animes, this film might be right for you.  It just was'nt for me.  I still gave it 3 stars.

His novels were loosely based off of a Persian legend and myth known as &quot;Amir Arislan&quot;.  Later the story was adopted into manga form by Chisata Nakura and finally it was animated.  The four tape OAV series is well written, exciting, beautifully animated, wonderfully dubbed, and has a phenomenal sound track.The very first tape introduces the viewers to the background story and the imporant characters.  It all begins with the handsome knight Daryoon who is stripped of his command and banished by King Andragoras of Palse for questioning his military strategy regarding a battle against the invading forces of the Luisitanians.  Daryoon's uncle convinces him not to abandon the kingdom, but to instead to go and find the kind, intelligent, bishounen Prince Arislan and to protect him with his life.  It is Daryoon's promise that allows him to save the young prince from meeting his end on the battlefield at the hands of treachery within Palse, sorcery, and the invading Luisitanian army.  The two flee to the home of the brillant military strategist Lord Narsus and his companion Elam.  Also the goddess Misra sends high priestess Phrangese to protect prince Arislan.  On her way to meet up with the prince she encounters the traveling minstrel Gieve.
