You can tell that they have true raw comedic talent, but the script doesn't do anything to really showcase their abilities. Griffin was funny for like 5 seconds and then he becomes just plain annoying. Everything about this movie is like an overstuffed burrito: JUST PLAIN MESSY. I must've laughed about 2 times during the entire movie. If you MUST see this movie, don't buy it, don't rent it, just borrow it.

537700,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXTP,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","...`Double Take' has not aged very well for me.  I remember seeing this in the theaters and liking it.  It made me laugh and it had action and I was like sixteen and that was all that mattered at the moment.  After the dust cleared and my mind aged I revisited this film to find that it was nothing like I had remembered.  The laughs didn't come as readily as I had hoped and the plot was such a mess I was stumped as to how I enjoyed this at all when I had first seen it.  Then I remembered.  There are some films that knowledgably toss a recognizable and likable name in your face in order to blind you to the ridiculousness of everything going on.  In 2001, those names were Orlando Jones and Eddie Griffin.  For what it's worth, both actors are charismatic as all get out and they feed off each other rather well here.  They have their usual shtick, and it works for them, but when you cast aside their inherent likeability, the film just falls apart.  The action sequences seem out of place and the plot development is vacant.  Really, the only selling point here is the two lead actors.  I am not saying that all `buddy/action' flicks need to make sense.  I am a fan of films like `The Fast and The Furious' and even `Rush Hour', but that is because the films have more focused delivery that allocates for the implausibility of their plots.  They don't make sense but the films are still focused and deceptively cohesive.  `Double Take' doesn't understand that necessity.  It just continually lathers on the crazy without taking the time to polish it, to properly execute it.

When I first entered the theater I quickly noticed the jokes were in the seats. Not in my entire lifetime had I seen a theater so empty.
