Mostly, I'd say it was the mood, the way it took me back to a time I did not know, but now have a sense of what it might have been like.I first watched/ listened to this while packing boxes for a move. I really only intended it to be background noise while I worked, but instead I found myself coming back to it, slowing my packing progress.I now own the DVD so I can watch it at my leisure. I have since spent the time researching many of the interesting things mentioned. It must have been an amazing sight. Even for us jaded folks of the 21st century.Oddly enough, when the DVD ends, I feel just a little bit how folks might have felt when the Fair ended: a sense of loss; a sadness that it had to end.Please note: My review is a based upon the needed escapism I experienced while watching.

Perhaps it was the optimism, seen from a historic perspective, of a world at relative peace. Most definitely it was the vast wealth of new technologies that were being seen by masses of people for the very first time. But the most fascinating aspect to me was how the planning and landscape design of Frederick Law Olmstead was implemented so quickly and on such a vast scale -- and how the many architects such as Louis Sullivan, Daniel Burnham, Charles McKim, Richard Morris Hunt and a bevy of others lead construction projects to create this ""White City"" in such a short space of time. Granted, the buildings only needed to stand for the half year of the Fair, but they also had to withstand an inundation of more than 28 million visitors.""Expo"" is able to show a wide view of the story, and is a well researched and well written documentary. The narration by Gene Wilder is excellent, and it truly could have been made into a week long mini-series since there is so much of interest to such a wide variety of viewers. Since the Expo took place before ""moving pictures"" were used (in fact Thomas Edison introduced to the public the Kinetograph - the first practical moving picture camera - and the Kinetoscope at the 1893 Expo), there is no ""file footage"" to use for the documentary. This limits the film makers to doing two very annoying things: constantly panning or zooming on drawings or photos, and doing short recreation segments (thankfully not many). I also am baffled by the constant mention and footage of a belly-dancer who is featured on no less than 9 occasions, and constant shots of beer or wine being poured into mugs or glasses. Freud would have a few things to say about this, but I shall simply refrain.Overall, a very worthwhile documentary, that is entertaining and educational.

Yes, I could almost imagine being there from time to time and I was impressed at how big and detailed the fair was. They used the latest technology and that at times was very risky. More than 600acres was built on former swampland that would not support any real buildings and that land all had to be reclaimed. They used electricity and electric lighting on a scale that had never existed before. They did not sugarcoat the fair or the many problems that they faced. It was a rough and tumble situation in a rough and tumble place and time. The fair had to be done on a profit basis...and it was. There were fights as to what was to be allowed or not and almost everything was eventually allowed. There were so many displays that a person could not possibly have seen it all...Chicago has never been a perfect place and they did not have a perfect fair....but it certainly was an interesting one. One of the telling displays was done by Germany and Krupp steel. They chose to show huge cannons and much war armament.

Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[2, 2]","This historical documentary tells the story of Chicago's 1893 World's Fair, originally intended to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Columbus discovering the Americas. The DVD also provides details of many exhibits, including those by George Westinghouse (eg. a switchboard, step-up and step-down transformers, and operational railway motor), Nikola Tesla (eg. a two-phase induction motor, generators, shooting lightning from his fingers), and Thomas Edison, as well as the outside the fair side-shows, belly-dancing, Ferris wheel, the first commercial movie theater, and Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. (Excluding the latter from the Fair was a serious financial mistake.)The fair covered over 600 acres, and featured nearly 200 new, though temporary, buildings of neoclassical architecture, canals and lagoons, and exhibits from around the world (46 nations). Over 27 million attended during its six-month run. The buildings were clad in white stucco and illuminated with extensive use of street lights; they were part of the inspiration for Katharine Bates' 'America the Beautiful.' The Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building was then the world's largest; today it would rank #2 in volume and 3rd in footprint.Only two of the original fair structures are still standing - the Palace of Fine Arts and the World's Congress Auxiliary Building.The original Ferris Wheel (264 feet high, 36 cars - each capable of holding 60 people) proved to be a major attendance draw and helped put the fair into the black. Westinghouse won the bid to power the electrical needs of the fair, using AC current - proving the safety and reliability of that method and helping gain acceptance over Edison's direct current. In retaliation, General Electric banned the use of its Edison lights at the fair; Westinghouse responded with its own version that both reduced the cost and increased the life of their lights.Overall, the number of buildings and the exhibits within those buildings was incredible; one would have to make numerous repeated trips to fully benefit.",5,Overwhelming -,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,2049,"['historical', 'documentary', 'story', 'Chicago', '1893', 'World', 'Fair', 'originally', 'intended', 'commemorate', '400th', 'anniversary', 'Columbus', 'discovering', 'Americas', 'DVD', 'also', 'details', 'many', 'exhibits', 'including', 'George', 'Westinghouse', 'eg', 'switchboard', 'step-up', 'step-down', 'transformers', 'operational', 'railway', 'motor', 'Nikola', 'Tesla', 'eg', 'two-phase', 'induction', 'motor', 'generators', 'shooting', 'lightning', 'fingers', 'Thomas', 'Edison', 'as', 'well', 'fair', 'side-shows', 'belly-dancing', 'Ferris', 'wheel', 'first', 'commercial', 'movie', 'theater', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'Wild', 'West', 'Show', 'Excluding', 'latter', 'Fair', 'was', 'serious', 'financial', 'mistake', 'fair', 'covered', '600', 'acres', 'featured', 'nearly', '200', 'new', 'temporary', 'buildings', 'neoclassical', 'architecture', 'canals', 'lagoons', 'exhibits', 'world', '46', 'nations', '27', 'million', 'attended', 'six-month', 'run', 'buildings', 'were', 'clad', 'white', 'stucco', 'illuminated', 'extensive', 'use', 'street', 'lights', 'were', 'part', 'inspiration', 'Katharine', 'Bates', 'Beautiful', 'Manufactures', 'Liberal', 'Arts', 'Building', 'was', 'then', 'world', 'largest', 'today', 'would', 'rank', '2', 'volume', '3rd', 'footprint.Only', 'two', 'original', 'fair', 'structures', 'are', 'still', 'standing', 'Palace', 'Fine', 'Arts', 'World', 'Congress', 'Auxiliary', 'Building.The', 'original', 'Ferris', 'Wheel', '264', 'feet', 'high', '36', 'cars', 'capable', 'holding', '60', 'people', 'proved', 'be', 'major', 'attendance', 'draw', 'helped', 'put', 'fair', 'black', 'Westinghouse', 'won', 'bid', 'power', 'electrical', 'needs', 'fair', 'using', 'AC', 'current', 'proving', 'safety', 'reliability', 'method', 'helping', 'gain', 'acceptance', 'Edison', 'direct', 'current', 'retaliation', 'General', 'Electric', 'banned', 'use', 'Edison', 'lights', 'fair', 'Westinghouse', 'responded', 'own', 'version', 'reduced', 'cost', 'increased', 'life', 'lights.Overall', 'number', 'buildings', 'exhibits', 'buildings', 'was', 'incredible', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'make', 'numerous', 'repeated', 'trips', 'fully', 'benefit']",EXPO - Magic of the White City

Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 4]","Like so many other viewers, I came round to viewing EXPO - The Magic of the White City (""EXPO"") because I read The Devil in the White City  (The White City) first.  Sort of.  Actually, my wife read The White City years after I did and, her curiosity piqued, rented the DVD.EXPO is about the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, an exposition of such majesty, scope, corruption, and expense that it is a feat unparalleled in America today.  The closest we have to the Fair is Disney World, a lineage most explicitly drawn in The White City; Walt Disney's father, Elias, was a construction worker on some of the buildings at the fair.EXPO is narrated by Gene Wilder.  I'm admit to a bias - I'm a big fan of Young Frankenstein and he's the only ""celebrity sighting"" I've ever encountered in real life. Wilder's getting on in age (the DVD was produced in 2005), so there's now a bit of a whistle to his speech. Still, his lilting voice has enough emotion and wry humor to make his narration enjoyable.  And there is a lot of narration.We tend to think of previous American centuries as quaintly backward, where such modern notions as political correctness and global unity didn't exist.  And while EXPO is careful to point out that American culture still had its own foibles and intolerance endemic to the time, the World's Fair put all those to shame.  It was a global unification of wealth, prosperity, and cultural exchange in a way that's inconceivable in today's contentious world. We can learn a lot from the Chicago World's Fair.EXPO uses old maps and photographs to detail events at the fair whenever possible, with few computer graphics or animation.  There are occasional shots of live actors, none whom particularly add anything of value to the narrative.  In fact, it's clear that the producers felt that the medium was a little dry, because there are copious live action shots of a belly dancer interspersed with discussion of the Midway.Minor quibbles aside, EXPO works overtime to try to encompass the grandeur of such a huge undertaking without losing sight of the details. As a result, it necessarily glosses over some pieces (rampant corruption, the aforementioned Devil himself who is the subject of The White City book) and emphasizes others (global diversity, architecture, and the first appearances of American staples). That's okay though; EXPO is a huge undertaking with such a sweepingly broad subject that it's better served as a companion piece to a book.

Finally, how many such programs like this get made these days anyway? For the producers to take on a project like this shows they have great fondness for the subject. Minor complaints like too much belly dancing is irrelevant to the overall excellence of the program.

I had seen the occassional photo of ""Big Mary"" and Court of Honor, but was not familiar with the scale and history of the Exposition.I was advised that my whole family would enjoy this DVD, but my 8- and 11-year olds weren't interested.  That is, they weren't until they walked into the room where the documentary was playing.  Perhaps it's something about Gene Wilder's voice, or perhaps it's those incredible images, or simply the mystery and romance of a time when electric lights were a magical new phenomenon; but once engaged, they were completely transfixed.I can't recommend this DVD enough.  We all loved it, and it inspired each of us to seek out age-appropriate books related to the 1893 fair (I'm now reading ""Devil in the White City"" and the kids are reading ""Fair Weather"").",5,Completely captivating!

I am from Chicago and my great grandfather came to Chicago, from Germany. He was a brick layer in Berlin. Chicago was where the jobs were. I know he was in Chicago when the Columbian Expo was going on. There was very little written about family backgrounds.My wife's maiden name is Ferris. For generations her family believed they were related to George Washington Ferris, inventor of the Ferris wheel, which was first exhibited at the Chicago Columbian Expo.Further investigations revealed that the family myths were just that, myths. The DVD gave us a lot of information on the inventions of the day, why the Expo was so popular. As a youth, growing up in Chicago, one of my favorite places was the Museum of Science and Industry. The only building still standing, from the fair. I think that museum may have had a lot of influence on my career. I'm an engineer.

Everything is covered in enough detail:  the back door dealings in selecting Chicago, the actual presentations and buildings, and that this beautiful City was never meant to last.  (I would have liked to have seen more about certain displays.  But as so much was shown at the fair, each building is only given 5 - 10 minutes.)Almost the entire documentary is Gene Wilder narrating over old pictures and paintings of the fair.  I was surprised about how few pictures there were of certain buildings until the documentary explained near the end why this was.  The documentary does use a map to show where events where held but this really does not the viewer any perspective of the size or scale.  Though I have heard better narration, Gene Wilder isn't too bad with enough change in his voice to keep the viewer interested.My only complaint is in order to compensate for the lack of pictures, the producers added some very cheap looking video of the same belly dancer and animals.  I found this to be very annoying - especially as they would occasionally show these videos when Gene Wilder was actually talking about something unrelated.Overall this is a great documentary and I was left feeling that we all missed seeing an event that will probably never happen again.
