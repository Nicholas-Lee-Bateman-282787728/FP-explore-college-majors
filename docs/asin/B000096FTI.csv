752382,A3SZXYX9YEDGT6,B000096FTI,"Addison Dewitt ""I'm nobody's fool.""","[3, 3]","It's difficult to formulate what hasn't already been said about this woman without sounding lofty or fawning, but I feel compelled to write a review of this tape because it only has one other one.First, for ANY fan of Ms. Mitchell, it's a must-have.  You get the early years, lots of photographs and footage, her rise to stardom and her feelings about it all from her now 60+ perspective, which I found most telling.  All that wisdom and ""reflection back"" is great to watch.I would give this tape 5 stars, but when I first viewed this documentary via ""American Masters"" on PBS, there was more footage about her brief fling with David Crosby (after having been with G. Nash) which is missing from this version.  Also, there is additional footage added to the end of this (and sporadically throughout) of commentary by the artist as well as other edits that are different from the PBS version (early scenes of her smoking a joint with the guys, scenes of her and Graham in a car and other late 60's stuff are gone but other scenes are newly added of her 90's paintings, later performances and comments).  You end up wishing the piece was whole with all of the above included, but we'll take what we can get of this maestro.All in all, however, this documentary is a treat to watch.  Like a home movie, a diary and a confessional all in one.  She distilled what many feel about her in one sentence: ""In order to really touch people deeply, you have to first strike a chord in yourself that touches you deeply.""She has done that and more for millions, and this is only one of many telling quotes she delivers, all the while puffing on a ubiquitous cigarette, which will most likely spell her demise.  No matter, she's lived several lifetimes already and can live forever in our minds, on this tape and on her CD's.",4,Enigmatic Super-talent,1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,1810,"['difficult', 'formulate', 'what', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'woman', 'sounding', 'lofty', 'fawning', 'feel', 'compelled', 'write', 'review', 'tape', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'one.First', 'ANY', 'fan', 'Ms.', 'Mitchell', 'must-have', 'get', 'early', 'years', 'lots', 'photographs', 'footage', 'rise', 'stardom', 'feelings', 'now', '60+', 'perspective', 'found', 'most', 'telling', 'wisdom', 'reflection', 'back', 'great', 'watch.I', 'would', 'give', 'tape', '5', 'stars', 'when', 'first', 'viewed', 'documentary', 'American', 'Masters', 'PBS', 'was', 'more', 'footage', 'brief', 'fling', 'David', 'Crosby', 'having', 'been', 'G.', 'Nash', 'missing', 'version', 'Also', 'additional', 'footage', 'added', 'end', 'sporadically', 'commentary', 'artist', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'edits', 'are', 'different', 'PBS', 'version', 'early', 'scenes', 'smoking', 'joint', 'guys', 'scenes', 'Graham', 'car', 'other', 'late', '60', 'stuff', 'are', 'gone', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', 'newly', 'added', '90', 'paintings', 'later', 'performances', 'comments', 'end', 'up', 'wishing', 'piece', 'was', 'whole', 'above', 'included', ""'ll"", 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'maestro.All', 'however', 'documentary', 'treat', 'watch', 'home', 'movie', 'diary', 'confessional', 'one', 'distilled', 'what', 'many', 'feel', 'one', 'sentence', 'order', 'really', 'touch', 'people', 'deeply', 'have', 'first', 'strike', 'chord', 'deeply', 'done', 'more', 'millions', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'telling', 'quotes', 'delivers', 'while', 'puffing', 'ubiquitous', 'cigarette', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'spell', 'demise', 'matter', 'lived', 'several', 'lifetimes', 'already', 'can', 'live', 'forever', 'minds', 'tape', 'CD']",N/A
752383,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000096FTI,Alfred Johnson,"[3, 3]","I viewed the American Masters documentary on Joni Mitchell during a time when I have been re-reading Norman Mailer's Marilyn- his take on the life of the legendary screen star Marilyn Monroe. And although there is no obvious connection between the lives or the talents of the two women there is a tale of two generations hidden here. Marilyn represented for my parent's generation, the generation that survived the Great Depression and fought World War II, the epitome of blond glamour, sex and talent. To my more `sedate' generation blond-haired Joni represented the introspective, searching, quiet beauty that we sought to represent our longings for understanding of a seemingly baffling world we had not made. As this documentary and Mailer's book point out however they `represented' our fantasies they also shared a common vulnerability- attempting to be independent women in worlds dominated by men. Such is the life of the great creative talents.This well-done documentary traces Joni's life from the snow-bound Canadian farmlands to her early rise to stardom at the tail end of the folk revival of the 1960's. It also traces the later twists in her creative career as she tried to break out of the `folkie' milieu; the successful attempt to be a rocker; the less successful attempt to be a female Leonard Cohen searching the depths of her soul; the attempt to turn herself into a torch singer and later the attempt to take on the jazz idiom under the direction of the legendary Charlie Mingus: and, finally the semi-reversion to her youth under the banner of protest against some of the injustices of the world. Along the way various lovers, learners, hangers-on and fellow song writers give their takes on her place in the musical history of her time. This is always a welcome touch. Moreover, since she will have a big place in that history it helps tell us how very influential she was in that endeavor.",5,SONGS TO AGING CHILDREN,1187740800,"08 22, 2007",2007,1914,"['viewed', 'American', 'Masters', 'documentary', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'time', 'when', 'have', 'been', 're-reading', 'Norman', 'Mailer', 'Marilyn-', 'take', 'life', 'legendary', 'screen', 'star', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'obvious', 'connection', 'lives', 'talents', 'two', 'women', 'tale', 'two', 'generations', 'hidden', 'here', 'Marilyn', 'represented', 'parent', 'generation', 'generation', 'survived', 'Great', 'Depression', 'fought', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'epitome', 'blond', 'glamour', 'sex', 'talent', 'more', 'sedate', 'generation', 'blond-haired', 'Joni', 'represented', 'introspective', 'searching', 'quiet', 'beauty', 'sought', 'represent', 'longings', 'understanding', 'seemingly', 'baffling', 'world', 'had', 'not', 'made', 'documentary', 'Mailer', 'book', 'point', 'out', 'however', 'represented', 'fantasies', 'also', 'shared', 'common', 'vulnerability-', 'attempting', 'be', 'independent', 'women', 'worlds', 'dominated', 'men', 'Such', 'life', 'great', 'creative', 'talents.This', 'well-done', 'documentary', 'traces', 'Joni', 'life', 'snow-bound', 'Canadian', 'farmlands', 'early', 'rise', 'stardom', 'tail', 'end', 'folk', 'revival', '1960', 'also', 'later', 'twists', 'creative', 'career', 'tried', 'break', 'folkie', 'milieu', 'successful', 'attempt', 'be', 'rocker', 'less', 'successful', 'attempt', 'be', 'female', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'searching', 'depths', 'soul', 'attempt', 'turn', 'torch', 'singer', 'later', 'attempt', 'take', 'jazz', 'idiom', 'direction', 'legendary', 'Charlie', 'Mingus', 'finally', 'semi-reversion', 'youth', 'banner', 'protest', 'injustices', 'world', 'way', 'various', 'lovers', 'learners', 'hangers-on', 'fellow', 'song', 'writers', 'give', 'place', 'musical', 'history', 'time', 'always', 'welcome', 'touch', 'Moreover', 'will', 'have', 'big', 'place', 'history', 'tell', 'how', 'very', 'influential', 'was', 'endeavor']",N/A

Interesting to note how she adapts to a new period and always re-invents herself.  She has never gone after pop music but stayed personal in her approach.  I especially enjoyed her speaking of her guitar playing and she referred to her strange guitar tunings as a ""Chords or Inquiry"".

I played it on my laptop with my Bose earphones and my gosh!!! I forgot how much I miss that voice.  Her self taught, avant-garde style transcends any other english speaking singer, bar non.  I was especially intrigued by her somewhat normal childhood (except for her childhood polio) and her mystical rise to a non-wanted fame.  Her songs, primarily based upon her infectious loneliness and her life's travels with the many men in her life, are filled with true poetry which uses an incredible combination of visual and unconventional prose.While I was particularly intrigued with her relationship with David Crosby (her first producer), Graham Nash (her long time live-in lover) and David Geffen (her second producer and confidant), I was disturbed at the sixties logic that permiated their lives.  But again, that was the sixties.I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants a good sixties history lesson ofAmerican west coast music; you should purchase this DVD.

752387,AZFOXFBLZ63UA,B000096FTI,D. Webster,"[12, 12]","This is an essential dvd to own if the music has reached you.When I first started listening to her music, nice songs were enough. It didn't take long to see that there was something else going on with her, an unprecidented honesty and seemingly fearless ability to press boundaries. This is a rare glimse into a powerful creative spirit, willing to pay the prices required to follow a difficult journey.We see a young girl, striving for success and the opportunity to share her music, blossoming into the remarkable woman she is today. This dvd is a story of the journey, and invaluable to anyone looking for more depth than sound bites or ""clips"" to tap your toe to. As she states in the film, it was never her intention to be a human jukebox, and I'm certain not her intention to create a dvd which is nothing more than a trite collection of rock videos.This should be required viewing for anyone who has ever wrestled with the creative process in any form. Genius achieving this kind of fruition does not happen very often, and there are few pieces of life as fascinating. It's also for anyone who cares about the idealism of days gone by, and holding onto the good. It seems strangely out of synch with the state of the world as it is today, and that's a shame. All the more reason why this is required fuel for people need to remain in that place.Most artists whom we admire live their lives in obscurity. We know their stage presence, or see what their agents believe will encourage sales of the next cd, book or painting. Joni's career has been entirely different, and a window into her. Through each of her phases, I've loved what I've seen.

752388,A1DQ3KRA6AD4KI,B000096FTI,erica2,"[2, 2]","OK, first the negatives. The person who gave this a 1-star review because it didn't include full songs had a point, but a small point. I mean, you buy a documentary to learn about the artist and the artist's life, not to hear full performances. If you want that, go, as said reviewer suggested, get a concert video. That said, it was a bit frustrating that the film makers stuck to a formula of only allowing about 10 - 20 seconds of each performance and then introducing a voiceover, either  from some music authority, or from someone who knew her, or from Joni herself.The one place it is really unforgivable is on the song ""Just Like Me,"" because Joni never released this song and therefore it is impossible to listen to the full song on any of her albums. Also, some of the performances were just too stunning to cut short.The only other negative is that the people they interviewed are all from Joni's generation or a bit younger but no one was interviewed from younger generations who have been influenced by her, some of whom are very famous and their inclusion would have boosted the DVD's visibility, besides the fact that what they would have had to say would have been interesting.OK, now the positives. This DVD has incredible footage of Joni, starting with childhood photos and home movies from her native Saskatchewan and continuing through the most magical periods of her career, esp, for me, the California period around 1969-1972. Visually it's a stunning documentary, in part because Joni is so beautiful and so is the art she has created. And then there is the music....omg the music. Her talent towers so high that it makes 99% of today's recording artists seem like hacks. It's also exciting that some of these live performances exceed her studio performances, so, for example, if you want to hear a version of ""Case of You"" or ""Blue"" that in some ways is even better than the ones heard on the ""Blue"" album, you gotta hear these, even though they're only excerpts.The film makers pretty much assume an intelligent audience and they tend not to dumb down the complexities of Joni's life. However, they did need to leave out a lot, but, as another reviewer noted, there are limits to this form and you can't include everything. Still, they skipped over an album that, as time has gone by, I feel is one of Joni's very strongest:  ""Chalk Marks in a Rainstorm."" However, with a career this huge, decisions had to be made what to cut and what to leave. I found that this DVD really makes you feel Joni's spirit and exposes viewers to her intelligence as well; she's an awesome conversationalist and few people know that side of her because she has not given very many interviews. It's great that the documentarians ""came for conversation"" as well as for music and art.",4,totally worth it,1293235200,"12 25, 2010",2010,2785,"['OK', 'first', 'negatives', 'person', 'who', 'gave', '1-star', 'review', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'full', 'songs', 'had', 'point', 'small', 'point', 'mean', 'buy', 'documentary', 'learn', 'artist', 'artist', 'life', 'not', 'hear', 'full', 'performances', 'want', 'go', 'said', 'reviewer', 'suggested', 'get', 'concert', 'video', 'said', 'was', 'bit', 'frustrating', 'film', 'makers', 'stuck', 'formula', 'only', 'allowing', '10', '20', 'seconds', 'performance', 'then', 'introducing', 'voiceover', 'music', 'authority', 'someone', 'who', 'knew', 'Joni', 'herself.The', 'one', 'place', 'really', 'unforgivable', 'song', 'Just', 'Me', 'Joni', 'never', 'released', 'song', 'therefore', 'impossible', 'listen', 'full', 'song', 'albums', 'Also', 'performances', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'stunning', 'cut', 'short.The', 'only', 'other', 'negative', 'people', 'interviewed', 'are', 'Joni', 'generation', 'bit', 'younger', 'one', 'was', 'interviewed', 'younger', 'generations', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'influenced', 'whom', 'are', 'very', 'famous', 'inclusion', 'would', 'have', 'boosted', 'DVD', 'visibility', 'fact', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'say', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting.OK', 'now', 'positives', 'DVD', 'incredible', 'footage', 'Joni', 'starting', 'childhood', 'photos', 'home', 'movies', 'native', 'Saskatchewan', 'continuing', 'most', 'magical', 'periods', 'career', 'esp', 'California', 'period', '1969-1972', 'Visually', 'stunning', 'documentary', 'part', 'Joni', 'so', 'beautiful', 'so', 'art', 'created', 'then', 'music', 'music', 'talent', 'towers', 'so', 'high', '99', '%', 'today', 'recording', 'seem', 'hacks', 'also', 'exciting', 'live', 'performances', 'exceed', 'studio', 'performances', 'so', 'example', 'want', 'hear', 'version', 'Case', 'Blue', 'ways', 'even', 'better', 'ones', 'heard', 'Blue', 'album', 'got', 'ta', 'even', ""'re"", 'only', 'excerpts.The', 'film', 'makers', 'pretty', 'much', 'intelligent', 'audience', 'tend', 'not', 'dumb', 'down', 'complexities', 'Joni', 'life', 'However', 'did', 'need', 'leave', 'out', 'lot', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'are', 'limits', 'form', 'ca', ""n't"", 'include', 'everything', 'Still', 'skipped', 'album', 'time', 'gone', 'feel', 'one', 'Joni', 'very', 'strongest', 'Chalk', 'Marks', 'Rainstorm', 'However', 'career', 'huge', 'decisions', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'what', 'cut', 'what', 'leave', 'found', 'DVD', 'really', 'feel', 'Joni', 'spirit', 'viewers', 'intelligence', 'well', 'awesome', 'conversationalist', 'few', 'people', 'know', 'side', 'not', 'given', 'very', 'many', 'interviews', 'great', 'documentarians', 'came', 'conversation', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'art']",N/A

752395,A1U6B2LDK3BUVU,B000096FTI,"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are...","[4, 13]","I always liked Joni Mitchell.  I remember when she came out with her first album, and I thought it was amazing.  The first thing I noticed was her voice, her range.  Just thinking of the vocal instrument itself, she was up there with Joan Baez and Judy Collins.  Her more recent material isn't as vocally challenging as her earliest material, in terms of the range of notes she hits.She seems to have had a lot of angst in her life.  You would think she wouldn't; that she would have led a joyful life, considering that she was a big star.  You would love to change places with her and be rich and famous, but somehow she seemed to muck things up pretty much and get depressed.There's something so likeable about her.  She does her own thing.  She doesn't chase wealth and fame, and never did.  I see a lot of myself in her, in that regard.  Just be yourself and don't worry about it.  To those of you who are familiar with astrology, Joni and I share the same sun and moon signs, which is a 100-1 coincidence.  Grant Lewi, the greatest astrologer of all time, described her sun and moon combination as being part of that discriminating and appreciative public without which the arts are pointless.  She has a Scorpio sun with a Pisces moon.  Very deep, watery, intelligent woman.  Nothing superficial there.I'm not a big fan of her more current music.  It's okay.  It just doesn't grab me very hard.  She seems to be a Type Four in the enneagram system of personality types, a true original, a true artist, looking within for inspiration, not wanting to be one of the crowd, not wanting to copy anyone else.  Other Type Fours include Dylan, Alanis Morissette, Prince.  When I think of Alanis I think of her music video in which she appeared on a city street completely naked, not to be sexy, just to be herself, in a pose that was more revealing than it was flattering.  Joni Mitchell is the type that wants to express her true feelings, and it doesn't necessarily lead to record sales.",4,"Joni is a class act, an original",1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,1987,"['always', 'liked', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'remember', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'first', 'album', 'thought', 'was', 'amazing', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'voice', 'range', 'Just', 'thinking', 'vocal', 'instrument', 'was', 'up', 'there', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'Judy', 'Collins', 'more', 'recent', 'material', ""n't"", 'vocally', 'challenging', 'earliest', 'material', 'terms', 'range', 'notes', 'hits.She', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'angst', 'life', 'would', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'would', 'have', 'led', 'joyful', 'life', 'considering', 'was', 'big', 'star', 'would', 'love', 'change', 'places', 'be', 'rich', 'famous', 'somehow', 'seemed', 'muck', 'things', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'something', 'so', 'likeable', 'own', 'thing', ""n't"", 'chase', 'wealth', 'fame', 'never', 'did', 'see', 'lot', 'myself', 'regard', 'Just', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'astrology', 'Joni', 'share', 'same', 'sun', 'moon', 'signs', '100-1', 'coincidence', 'Grant', 'Lewi', 'greatest', 'astrologer', 'time', 'described', 'sun', 'moon', 'combination', 'being', 'part', 'discriminating', 'appreciative', 'public', 'arts', 'are', 'pointless', 'Scorpio', 'sun', 'Pisces', 'moon', 'Very', 'deep', 'watery', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'Nothing', 'superficial', 'there.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'more', 'current', 'music', 'okay', 'just', ""n't"", 'grab', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'Type', 'Four', 'enneagram', 'system', 'personality', 'types', 'true', 'original', 'true', 'artist', 'looking', 'inspiration', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'one', 'crowd', 'not', 'wanting', 'copy', 'anyone', 'else', 'Other', 'Type', 'Fours', 'include', 'Dylan', 'Alanis', 'Morissette', 'Prince', 'When', 'think', 'Alanis', 'think', 'music', 'video', 'appeared', 'city', 'street', 'completely', 'naked', 'not', 'be', 'sexy', 'just', 'be', 'pose', 'was', 'more', 'revealing', 'was', 'flattering', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'type', 'express', 'true', 'feelings', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'lead', 'record', 'sales']",N/A

752397,A1WLZYEOIL1HLT,B000096FTI,"Michael King ""Mike""","[49, 50]","This DVD chronicles the life, loves and career of Joni Mitchell.  She was very strong-willed, battling childhood polio and later teaching herself to play guitar.  That combination of determination and talent helped her succeed in the male dominated world of folk music.  To paraphrase her, she wanted to combine the melodicism of the big band era with the lyricism of Bob Dylan in the songs she wrote.  She soon went from the coffee houses of Greenwich Village to Carnegie Hall.  Ever the wandering spirit, she moved from New York to Laurel Canyon, LA, where she met and fell in love with Graham Nash.  During that period, when they were living together,  Graham wrote &quot;Our House&quot; and Joni wrote the album &quot;Ladies Of The Canyon.&quot;  That album included the official anthem to the sixties' most famous music festival, &quot;Woodstock.&quot;  Ironically, Joni was supposed to play at Woodstock, but her manager talked her out of it at the last minute.The DVD goes on to chronicle Joni's musical journeys into pop (&quot;You Turn Me On, I'm A Radio&quot;) rock and roll (&quot;Raised On Robbery&quot;) and jazz (&quot;Mingus&quot;), a superb album that was savaged by the critics and ignored by the record buying public.  Joni continued to release many fine albums throughout the eighties and nineties.  Joni finally won a Grammy in 1996, when &quot;Turbulent Indigo&quot; won for best pop album.  Unlike other music veterans who won Grammies late in their careers, Joni's win did not translate into huge records sales and lots of radio airplay.  Nevertheless, this multi-talented artist continues to make great music.  The DVD includes snippets of songs performed in various concerts throughout her entire career.  A bonus section features four songs, taken from her 1998 video &quot;Painting With Words And Music,&quot;  in their entirety.  The songs are &quot;Big Yellow Taxi,&quot; &quot;Amelia,&quot; &quot;Hejira&quot; and &quot;Woodstock.&quot;",5,An Entertaining Biography,1056412800,"06 24, 2003",2003,1966,"['DVD', 'life', 'loves', 'career', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'was', 'very', 'strong-willed', 'battling', 'childhood', 'polio', 'later', 'teaching', 'play', 'guitar', 'combination', 'determination', 'talent', 'helped', 'succeed', 'male', 'dominated', 'world', 'folk', 'music', 'paraphrase', 'wanted', 'combine', 'melodicism', 'big', 'band', 'era', 'lyricism', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'songs', 'wrote', 'soon', 'went', 'coffee', 'houses', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'Ever', 'wandering', 'spirit', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'LA', 'where', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'Graham', 'Nash', 'period', 'when', 'were', 'living', 'together', 'Graham', 'wrote', 'quot', 'House', 'quot', 'Joni', 'wrote', 'album', 'quot', 'Ladies', 'Canyon.', 'quot', 'album', 'included', 'official', 'anthem', 'sixties', 'most', 'famous', 'music', 'festival', 'quot', 'Woodstock.', 'quot', 'Ironically', 'Joni', 'was', 'supposed', 'play', 'Woodstock', 'manager', 'talked', 'last', 'minute.The', 'DVD', 'chronicle', 'Joni', 'musical', 'journeys', 'pop', 'quot', 'Turn', 'Me', ""'m"", 'Radio', 'quot', 'rock', 'roll', 'quot', 'Raised', 'Robbery', 'quot', 'jazz', 'quot', 'Mingus', 'quot', 'superb', 'album', 'was', 'savaged', 'critics', 'ignored', 'record', 'buying', 'public', 'Joni', 'continued', 'release', 'many', 'fine', 'albums', 'eighties', 'nineties', 'Joni', 'finally', 'won', 'Grammy', '1996', 'when', 'quot', 'Turbulent', 'Indigo', 'quot', 'won', 'best', 'pop', 'album', 'other', 'music', 'veterans', 'who', 'won', 'Grammies', 'late', 'careers', 'Joni', 'win', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'huge', 'records', 'sales', 'lots', 'radio', 'airplay', 'Nevertheless', 'multi-talented', 'artist', 'make', 'great', 'music', 'DVD', 'snippets', 'songs', 'performed', 'various', 'concerts', 'entire', 'career', 'bonus', 'section', 'four', 'songs', 'taken', '1998', 'video', 'quot', 'Painting', 'Words', 'Music', 'quot', 'entirety', 'songs', 'are', 'quot', 'Big', 'Yellow', 'Taxi', 'quot', 'quot', 'Amelia', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hejira', 'quot', 'quot', 'Woodstock.', 'quot']",N/A

Her courage, her integrity, the enormous sacrifices and the very bold daring to lay it out and reach people with her thoughts  and emotions are all the more underscored by this remarkable flim. Her best songs, her best friends, her achievements and disappointments are all detailed here. The footage of her in concert is brilliant. Her honesty rules at all moments, and perhaps with all the posturing and self-righteousness that pervade music now, it is uncannily refreshing to listen to her once more, with very open ears.I understood exactly the breakdown and recovery she went through from BLUE to FOR THE ROSES, retreating to Canada, and I can understand what is so important about such a retreat. It seems to be for her like Coltrane's retreat to his home in Philly to beat heroin, only to re-emerge as the most forward thinking artist of his generation, spiritually renewed and with a vision clearly in focus. Mitchell seems to have undergone a similar spiritual conversion and when she came back from the wilds, she was prepared to journey where none of her contemporaries could imagine.Her romances, particularly with Graham Nash and Larry Klein are presented beautifully. Her collaborations with the very best in jazz: Mingus, Metheny, Jaco, Shorter: are in retrospect incredible artistic achievements, regardless of the criticism of the folk-rock nazis of the time. She connects with people, especially artists who are trying to make sense of the world and the lives we are given. Her mission to find her daughter re-oriented her priorities profoundly.

752402,AMZYAGVDQWTS,B000096FTI,Reviews No More,"[17, 19]","Upfront, I would just like to thank my friend Rob C. for reminding me of my roots by bringing me back to my once flaming fixation for Joni Mitchell, the artist and her music.  I had forgotten how much her music meant to me as a teenager and all through my 20s as I learned to connect to the world in a more sensitive way through her interpretations of life and love.  Mitchell is perhaps one of the greatest musical rebels of song with her ""weird chords"" which have since been imitated by many who followed in her footsteps.  For years she has been hated by those who don't have a grasp on the intricacies of what it means to see and feel things on such an intimate and deeply artistic level that it comes out as something other than some cliched embodiment of crass commercialism--something that's so predictable and safe that it can be embraced as easily as a collection of Air Supply songs.  This is too disposable for those who get Joni and, while not all of us long-time fans love all of her work, we can certainly all agree that disposable is not a term you can use to describe the lady's output.I picked up my first Joni Mitchell album in November of 1980 at the age of 16.  It was her very commercially successful jazz/folk album Court and Spark which was centered around her then flame, John Guerin.  I fell in love with the album immediately, and began one of a few musical romances that have lasted roughly a quarter of a century.  The more I got into her music, however, and the more of her phases I was exposed to, I found myself asking lots of questions about her muses and what I was unsure of in her lyrics.  Now, whether you are a long-time fan of Joni's or just starting out, I feel that this biography is imperative to own, as it answers a lot of questions I've been asking for a very long time.  It's like the unfinished portrait finally has a face, and it is a joyously flawed one that's beautiful for that very reason.If you find that Joni's music speaks to you on a nearly cosmic level, then you will be ecstatic with this biography.  You are given, by her, the missing pieces to the puzzle that weren't available in old biographical accounts, and you feel the love and respect of friends and peers alike as they reflect on their comraderie with her.  You will come to feel you know her intimately yourself if her music hasn't done that already.  If it has, and you've been away for a while, this DVD bio will reawaken that passionate intimacy in you again.  I was fascinated by this poet whose hard times haven't hurt her amazingly graceful disposition, and have come to appreciate her as a genuine musical treasure people are blessed to be touched by if they get her and her music.  Intelligent and well put together, this is a great DVD full of wonderful music (naturally), insightful interviews, and tons of Joni never being artificial or uneasy--except for her displeasure at playing for so many at the Isle of Wight festival, which was understandable for such an intimate performer.  My only gripe is that none of the songs from ""Hissing of Summer Lawns"" was included, but that's okay.  It's such a small oversight for so much wonderful material.  The Bonus features are also quite excellent.  One  final note:  I am so glad that, after that jerk Chuck Mitchell manipulated her, she finally found her daughter and grandchildren!  Joni is a one of a kind natural talent, and you will not regret owning this engrossing DVD; it's some of the best 2-plus hours you will ever spend in front of your TV.",5,A Fantastic Bio for Newcomers and Old Joni Fans Alike.,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,3526,"['Upfront', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'thank', 'friend', 'Rob', 'C.', 'reminding', 'roots', 'bringing', 'back', 'once', 'flaming', 'fixation', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'artist', 'music', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'much', 'music', 'meant', 'teenager', '20s', 'learned', 'connect', 'world', 'more', 'sensitive', 'way', 'interpretations', 'life', 'love', 'Mitchell', 'perhaps', 'one', 'greatest', 'musical', 'rebels', 'song', 'weird', 'chords', 'have', 'been', 'imitated', 'many', 'who', 'followed', 'footsteps', 'years', 'been', 'hated', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'grasp', 'intricacies', 'what', 'see', 'feel', 'things', 'intimate', 'deeply', 'artistic', 'level', 'out', 'something', 'other', 'cliched', 'embodiment', 'crass', 'commercialism', 'something', 'so', 'predictable', 'safe', 'can', 'be', 'embraced', 'easily', 'collection', 'Air', 'Supply', 'songs', 'too', 'disposable', 'who', 'get', 'Joni', 'not', 'long-time', 'fans', 'love', 'work', 'can', 'certainly', 'agree', 'disposable', 'not', 'term', 'can', 'use', 'describe', 'lady', 'output.I', 'picked', 'up', 'first', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'album', 'November', '1980', 'age', '16', 'was', 'very', 'commercially', 'successful', 'jazz/folk', 'album', 'Court', 'Spark', 'was', 'centered', 'then', 'flame', 'John', 'Guerin', 'fell', 'love', 'album', 'immediately', 'began', 'one', 'few', 'musical', 'romances', 'have', 'lasted', 'roughly', 'quarter', 'century', 'more', 'got', 'music', 'however', 'more', 'phases', 'was', 'exposed', 'found', 'asking', 'lots', 'questions', 'muses', 'what', 'was', 'unsure', 'lyrics', 'Now', 'are', 'long-time', 'fan', 'Joni', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'feel', 'biography', 'imperative', 'own', 'lot', 'questions', ""'ve"", 'been', 'asking', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'unfinished', 'portrait', 'finally', 'face', 'joyously', 'flawed', 'one', 'beautiful', 'very', 'reason.If', 'find', 'Joni', 'music', 'nearly', 'cosmic', 'level', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'ecstatic', 'biography', 'are', 'given', 'missing', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'were', ""n't"", 'available', 'old', 'biographical', 'accounts', 'feel', 'love', 'respect', 'friends', 'peers', 'alike', 'reflect', 'comraderie', 'will', 'come', 'feel', 'know', 'intimately', 'music', ""n't"", 'done', 'already', ""'ve"", 'been', 'away', 'while', 'DVD', 'bio', 'will', 'reawaken', 'passionate', 'intimacy', 'again', 'was', 'fascinated', 'poet', 'hard', 'times', 'have', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'amazingly', 'graceful', 'disposition', 'have', 'come', 'appreciate', 'genuine', 'musical', 'treasure', 'people', 'are', 'blessed', 'be', 'touched', 'get', 'music', 'Intelligent', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'great', 'DVD', 'full', 'wonderful', 'music', 'naturally', 'insightful', 'interviews', 'tons', 'Joni', 'never', 'being', 'artificial', 'uneasy', 'displeasure', 'playing', 'so', 'many', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'festival', 'was', 'understandable', 'such', 'intimate', 'performer', 'only', 'gripe', 'none', 'songs', 'Hissing', 'Summer', 'Lawns', 'was', 'included', 'okay', 'such', 'small', 'oversight', 'so', 'much', 'wonderful', 'material', 'Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'excellent', 'One', 'final', 'note', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'jerk', 'Chuck', 'Mitchell', 'manipulated', 'finally', 'found', 'daughter', 'grandchildren', 'Joni', 'one', 'kind', 'natural', 'talent', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'owning', 'engrossing', 'DVD', 'best', '2-plus', 'hours', 'will', 'ever', 'spend', 'front', 'TV']",N/A
752403,A1K94LXX833JTT,B000096FTI,Sanpete,"[2, 2]","This is a fairly comprehensive video biography, with photos and videos from every stage of Mitchell's life and career (up to 2003), including the story of her childhood polio, early love for painting (when music was a secondary love), the beginnings of her performing career in Alberta, the birth of her daughter, marriages, loves, musical companions, Laurel Canyon, New York, her changes in musical direction, and thoughts on all these things from her, friends, associates and music critics.  Participants include David Crosby, Graham Nash, James Taylor, Tom Rush, Eric Andersen, David Geffen, and many more.I'm in the crowd that was and still is enraptured by Mitchell's early music and sound.  It's still incredible that anyone could sing as she did, and her music was a perfect match for her voice.  In the documentary there is generous use of video recordings of early performances.  There's some attention to her unusual guitar style, self-taught, and to her unusual chords in particular.  David Crosby called them Martian chords; she called them ""chords of inquiry,"" because they have a question mark, corresponding to her unresolved feelings; she searched for chords that felt like she felt.And how she felt, as she points out, was an essential part of her music that has changed over the years.  When she was young she was depressed and vulnerable.  She calls her depression the sand for the pearl, and remarks that when the (creative) demons leave, the angels do too.  She doesn't mean by this that she's no longer musically creative, but it's evident that the exceptional emotional intensity of her early music isn't there in the same way in the later music.  Along with physical changes, in her voice from smoking and age, and in her hands from lingering effects of the polio (she has said elsewhere that it now hurts to play acoustic guitar), this explains some of the changes in her music over the years.  Even though my heart is especially with the early work, I enjoy her more recent music too, and can hardly begrudge her not staying depressed and vulnerable or changing in other ways.The documentary proper is 92 minutes, presented in anamorphic widescreen, and there are also nine bonus ""sound bites,"" interview pieces with Mitchell a minute or two long, organized by subject.  The video and sound quality varies with the source material, of course, but is generally just fine.  There are four bonus performances on the disc, all taken from the 1998 concertPainting with Words and Music.

Learned more about JM than I'd ever read or heard in the past.  A very good documentary of her life and times.  The song snippets were appropriate for this sort of story -- easy enough to buy the entire disk/cd/tape/platter/mp3 if you want to hear more. End to end, the documentary was well thought-out, organized & produced, and is a wonderful reminder of the many influences others had on her as well as her influences on many of us.
