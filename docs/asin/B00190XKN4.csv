It is sad that the little girl was so abused, but until we outlaw hitting kids, people will overdo this stupid, senseless manner of child-rearing.  I love when,  ""Grandpa,"" Lee Majors decked the abuser.My twelve year-grandson and I watched this together.  He was mesmerized  by every second of it.A lot of very important issues were raised here-Thank you to the producer and actors!My cousin was dreadfully abused by her real father and we had no idea. He beat her because he did not like her boyfriend.We often have no idea what goes on in ""respectable"" families.",5,GREAT MOVIE!,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,630,"['loved', 'movie', 'Anything', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'family', 'friendly', 'sad', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'so', 'abused', 'outlaw', 'hitting', 'kids', 'people', 'will', 'overdo', 'stupid', 'senseless', 'manner', 'child-rearing', 'love', 'when', 'Grandpa', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'decked', 'abuser.My', 'twelve', 'year-grandson', 'watched', 'together', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'second', 'it.A', 'lot', 'very', 'important', 'issues', 'were', 'raised', 'here-Thank', 'producer', 'actors', 'cousin', 'was', 'dreadfully', 'abused', 'real', 'father', 'had', 'idea', 'beat', 'did', 'not', 'boyfriend.We', 'often', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'respectable', 'families']",When I Find The Ocean

1161149,A3L3IP5RKAA0NB,B00190XKN4,"Jackie Rowles ""Jackie""","[19, 27]","This movie boasts that it is a ""family"" movie and is rated PG.  So far, so good.  The cast is quite good--Diane Ladd, Lee Majors and Graham Greene.  Greene is an excellent actor and has received an Oscar nomination in the past.  Well, there won't be any bids for the Oscar on this one.Despite calling itself a family movie, you get to watch a little girl who cannot come to grips with her father's death, child beating (welts and cuts are all over her back making you wonder how she can walk without crying), a child who has been told that her stepfather to be is going to kill her dog, a child running away and getting caught by the type of animal traps that will snap your leg off, two mountain men left over from Deliverance who slobber over the fact they caught a pretty girl in their trap, a panther stalking the child, the Ku Klux Klan in action and a Black mother and child burning to death in their home.The camera work is clumsy and toward the end of the film it becomes atrocious.  This is the first film I have ever seen where different scenes are not blended together.  When the scene stops, the screen goes black until the next scene appears.  At first, our family thought the TV had broken. Then we were sorry it hadn't.I note that the film festivals where the film has won awards are for amateur film makers.  So, maybe I'm being too hard.  Still I can't help but wonder how really good actors got caught in it. They have a terrible time trying to portray their parts due to the script which is mostly in single sentences.  None of the parts are rounded out so all of the acting stays on the surface.  The movie attempts to show why prejudice against the Blacks is wrong and then casts Graham Greene as a stereotype Indian in a kind of 'Tonto' role which is confusing.  In fact, this is where the script loses its way.  It starts with an unhappy child running away and ends up with a sermon on racial discrimination.Don't waste your money on a home movie.",1,Good Grief!,1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,1970,"['movie', 'family', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'cast', 'quite', 'good', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Greene', 'excellent', 'actor', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'past', 'Well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bids', 'Oscar', 'one.Despite', 'calling', 'family', 'movie', 'get', 'watch', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'grips', 'father', 'death', 'child', 'beating', 'welts', 'cuts', 'are', 'back', 'making', 'wonder', 'how', 'can', 'walk', 'crying', 'child', 'who', 'been', 'told', 'stepfather', 'be', 'going', 'kill', 'dog', 'child', 'running', 'away', 'getting', 'caught', 'type', 'animal', 'traps', 'will', 'snap', 'leg', 'two', 'mountain', 'men', 'left', 'over', 'Deliverance', 'who', 'slobber', 'fact', 'caught', 'pretty', 'girl', 'trap', 'panther', 'stalking', 'child', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'action', 'Black', 'mother', 'child', 'burning', 'death', 'home.The', 'camera', 'work', 'clumsy', 'end', 'film', 'atrocious', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'where', 'different', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'blended', 'together', 'When', 'scene', 'stops', 'screen', 'black', 'next', 'scene', 'first', 'family', 'thought', 'TV', 'had', 'broken', 'Then', 'were', 'sorry', ""hadn't.I"", 'note', 'film', 'festivals', 'where', 'film', 'won', 'awards', 'are', 'amateur', 'film', 'makers', 'So', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'hard', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'really', 'good', 'actors', 'got', 'caught', 'have', 'terrible', 'time', 'trying', 'portray', 'parts', 'due', 'script', 'mostly', 'single', 'sentences', 'None', 'parts', 'are', 'rounded', 'out', 'acting', 'stays', 'surface', 'movie', 'show', 'why', 'prejudice', 'Blacks', 'wrong', 'then', 'casts', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'stereotype', 'Indian', 'kind', ""'Tonto"", 'role', 'confusing', 'fact', 'where', 'script', 'way', 'unhappy', 'child', 'running', 'away', 'up', 'sermon', 'racial', 'discrimination.Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'home', 'movie']",When I Find The Ocean

It teaches us that child abuse, animal cruelty and racism is wrong and should never be tolerated. I like Lily because she knows what is about to happen and she is looking for peace. I HATE the stepfather!!! just seeing him abuse Lily made me feel like fighting him. That guy is such a bastard!!! I was glad the police arrested him in the movie because he deserved to go to jail. Overall, the movie was good and had a great message to it. I would definately allow my friends to see it. it is a really good movie.",5,A great movie that teaches us something important,1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,603,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'borrowed', 'video', 'store', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'child', 'abuse', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'racism', 'wrong', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'tolerated', 'like', 'Lily', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'looking', 'peace', 'HATE', 'stepfather', 'just', 'seeing', 'Lily', 'made', 'feel', 'fighting', 'guy', 'such', 'bastard', 'was', 'glad', 'police', 'arrested', 'movie', 'deserved', 'go', 'jail', 'Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'had', 'great', 'message', 'would', 'definately', 'allow', 'friends', 'see', 'really', 'good', 'movie']",When I Find The Ocean
1161151,A14OJS0VWMOSWO,B00190XKN4,Midwest Book Review,"[15, 21]","An award-winning saga inspired by a true story, When I Find the Ocean is a movie about a young girl coming to terms with the loss of her father. The ocean claimed the life of Lily Strickland's father; lacking a way to say goodbye, she leaves her grandparents and mother to confront her own fears amid the challenges of the wilderness. A deeply emotional, family-friendly movie unfolds, shot against breathtaking seacoast, river, and forest natural scenery. Highly recommended.
