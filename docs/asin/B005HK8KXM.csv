A diffusion filter appears to have been used, and it softens the image, reduces detail and adds an unfortunate bloom to the whites.Worse yet, the direction, camerawork and editing are awful. There are a lot of frequent cuts and overlapping images. At times, a freeze frame is used -- a very gimmicky effect that pulls you right out of the moment and makes you aware of the director. It made me appreciate even more the crystal-clear, well-directed EuroArts Blu-rays, which successfully convey a ""you are there"" quality that adds greatly to the excitement.This was a lost opportunity.",3,"Great performances, terrible video",1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,812,"['performances', 'opinion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat.The', 'sound', 'excellent', 'slightly', 'sterile', 'sounding', 'almost', 'were', 'recorded', 'studio.The', 'video', 'poor', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'symphonic', 'performance', 'Blu-ray', 'diffusion', 'filter', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'image', 'detail', 'unfortunate', 'bloom', 'whites.Worse', 'yet', 'direction', 'camerawork', 'editing', 'are', 'awful', 'are', 'lot', 'frequent', 'cuts', 'overlapping', 'images', 'times', 'freeze', 'frame', 'used', 'very', 'gimmicky', 'effect', 'right', 'moment', 'aware', 'director', 'made', 'appreciate', 'even', 'more', 'crystal-clear', 'well-directed', 'EuroArts', 'Blu-rays', 'successfully', 'convey', 'are', 'there', 'quality', 'greatly', 'excitement.This', 'was', 'lost', 'opportunity']",N/A

The audio recording too is excellent. More is the pity then that the picture quality of this release is one of the worse I have seen for a blu ray concert disc. I feel compelled to say something as nobody has taken the French TV guys to task for this appalling lapse in video standards. The color bias in the 4 th. symphony is too much towards the yellow- orange spectrum. Then suddenly when it comes to the 5th, everything takes on a drab bluish-grayish hue, and things get even more grey in the last symphony with the conductor's features acquiring a deathly hue which no amount of twiddling with the color controls could alleviate. What is going on here ? Poor lighting / exposure ? Injudicious use of a blue filter? Whatever the reason, potential purchasers would do well to take note...as they say caveat emptor !",3,"Great performances but ,a serious flaw...",1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,1162,"['Gergiev', 'interpretation', 'orchestra', 'performance', 'Tchaikovsky', '4th,5th', '6th', 'symphonies', 'are', 'bit', 'as', 'breathtaking', 'what', 'enthusiastic', 'reviewers', 'are', 'saying', 'reminds', 'very', 'much', 'buzz', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'Mravinsky', 'legendary', 'Leningraders', 'took', 'music', 'world', 'storm', 'fresh', 'idiomatic', 'approach', 'audio', 'recording', 'too', 'excellent', 'More', 'pity', 'then', 'picture', 'quality', 'release', 'one', 'worse', 'have', 'seen', 'blu', 'ray', 'concert', 'disc', 'feel', 'compelled', 'say', 'something', 'nobody', 'taken', 'French', 'TV', 'guys', 'task', 'appalling', 'lapse', 'video', 'standards', 'color', 'bias', '4', 'th', 'symphony', 'too', 'much', 'yellow-', 'orange', 'spectrum', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'when', '5th', 'everything', 'drab', 'bluish-grayish', 'hue', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'grey', 'last', 'symphony', 'conductor', 'features', 'acquiring', 'deathly', 'hue', 'amount', 'twiddling', 'color', 'controls', 'could', 'alleviate', 'What', 'going', 'here', 'Poor', 'lighting', '/', 'exposure', 'Injudicious', 'use', 'blue', 'filter', 'reason', 'potential', 'purchasers', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'take', 'note', 'say', 'caveat', 'emptor']",N/A
1461083,A103ZG6ASSR7UT,B005HK8KXM,Clive S. Goodwin,"[17, 17]","I am one who believes that Tchaikovsky needs to be played by a Russian orchestra and conductor. In his interview on this disc, Gergiev says he believes a conductor must be a dancer to properly conduct Tchaikovsky. He doesn't mean on the podium,just understanding the dance. Judging by the seemingly endless plodding, dull, soul-less performances of these symphonies that have been churned out over the years by conductors who should know better, both of us are right!My previous favorite video version of 4,5 & 6 has been by Fedoseyev and the Moscow Radio Symphony. They are very different from Gergiev's. The former does most things fast and faster, a bit like Mravinsky used to. Gergiev takes the scherzos in all three very fast, also, but in the other movements, he uses huge amounts of rubato, at some points almost grinding to a halt.Then he accelerates very quickly at climactic points - it's all very exciting stuff. The slow movements are very tender.The Mariinsky Orchestra players(formerly the Kirov Ballet Orchestra) are wonderful. Their ensemble work is much better than Fedoseyev's band, which can get pretty ragged when pressed. They obviously know Gergiev's requirements - which are not modest.Interestingly, he uses a baton for #4 - unusual for him. This is music-making of the highest order, and a screaming deal, if you get this disc (bluray)from Amazon UK.Picture, editing and sound are flawless in the bluray version.It's to be hoped we can get more from this source. Gergiev has been doing a lot of Mahler lately, in concert and #4 & 5 on dvd. Or how about some other Russian composers?I still like my Fedoseyev a lot, but Gergiev is more interesting and introspective in this music.

1461084,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005HK8KXM,Grady Harp,"[19, 21]","Likely every classical music lover owns at least one of the sets of Valery Gergiev conducting the Tchaikovsky symphonies 4 -6 (and probably many other recordings of other conductors and orchestras of these popular masterworks), but until seeing the live performances captured in January 2010 in the Salle Pleyel in Paris and hearing how Gergiev is committed to these scores then the zenith has not been experienced.  Not usually one to purchase a DVD of a orchestral performance until the recent spate of excellent ones, the actual close-the-eyes experience of truly hearing the performance is the test.  Have n fear.  This is an exception release.  Not only is Gergiev and his 'own' orchestra splendid in the symphonies 5 and 6 as he has been in his previous recordings, here he manages to prove that he has captured the special essence of the 4th symphony as well - not always the case in live or recorded performances in the past.The sound is breathtaking, the orchestra is playing at its inimitable best, and being able to observe Gergiev's facial expressions of total involvement in these performances is, well, a wonder.  This is Tchaikovsky restored to the master he has always been.  Included in this experience is an informative interview with Gergiev in which he speaks form the heart about his honoring the master of Russian music.  This is a quiet interview, reflective, informative and adds to the experience of starting from the top and viewing this gold standard of Tchaikovsky symphonic performances again. This is an experience the listener and viewer will never forget.

This was recorded in France, and although it was probably part of an earlier tour, the playing was impressive.  The musicians don't put much physical &#34;oomph&#34; into their playing, but they really give an amazing performance of Tchaikovsky's last three symphonies.  Gergiev provides what I consider to be the best interpretations I've heard of any of these symphonies.  The sound quality is superb and the camera work is unobtrusive.

1461087,AC6R0T1FMH7AY,B005HK8KXM,Satish Kamath,"[13, 14]","I am an unabashed fan of Valery Gergiev. I have considered his interpretations of the Russian and East European Composers as one of the best. However, this recording of the last three symphonies of Tchaikovsky left me totally unsatisfied. Maybe my expectations were a tad too high when I ordered for this.I have no idea whether to blame the quality of the audio recording (I played it on my Yamaha/Bose combination and then on another good system) or the interpretation (or lack of it) by Gergiev, but the net effect is rather disappointing. The orchestra seems to have been left totally to itself to interpret, and there is no 'tightness' if I may address it so, in the cohesion and ensemble and parts of it appear even 'muddy'and maybe 'airy' to say the least. The strings sound rather tired throughout, and the various climaxes within the work seem a little sterile.The video is the real redeeming factor here. In a home-video recording, I love to see the camera flit between the main and other instruments making the music and the conductor. Otherwise it becomes more like sitting in one position and watching much more of the conductor (like in Karajan recordings) or a meaningless collage of musicians making one want to switch off the screen and listen to the music only. Kudos.Abbado with the Berlin in Japan as well as Abbado conducting in Caracas seem far more lively and spirited and bring out the essence of Tchaikovsky in their interpretations. This one comes nowhere near the other Russian greats like the old Rozhdestvensky or Mravinsky recordings (audio and interpretation), and one of the other benchmarks for me, the Ormandy/Philiadelphia ones....Given the choice, I dont think I would recommend it as a 'worth buy' stuff.",3,Nothing Very Special,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,1740,"['am', 'unabashed', 'fan', 'Valery', 'Gergiev', 'have', 'considered', 'interpretations', 'Russian', 'East', 'European', 'Composers', 'one', 'best', 'However', 'recording', 'last', 'three', 'symphonies', 'Tchaikovsky', 'left', 'totally', 'unsatisfied', 'Maybe', 'expectations', 'were', 'tad', 'too', 'high', 'when', 'ordered', 'this.I', 'have', 'idea', 'blame', 'quality', 'audio', 'recording', 'played', 'Yamaha/Bose', 'combination', 'then', 'good', 'system', 'interpretation', 'lack', 'Gergiev', 'net', 'effect', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'orchestra', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'totally', 'interpret', ""'tightness"", 'may', 'address', 'so', 'cohesion', 'ensemble', 'parts', 'appear', 'even', ""'muddy'and"", 'maybe', 'say', 'least', 'strings', 'sound', 'rather', 'tired', 'various', 'climaxes', 'work', 'seem', 'little', 'sterile.The', 'video', 'real', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'here', 'home-video', 'recording', 'love', 'see', 'camera', 'flit', 'main', 'other', 'instruments', 'making', 'music', 'conductor', 'Otherwise', 'more', 'sitting', 'one', 'position', 'watching', 'much', 'more', 'conductor', 'Karajan', 'recordings', 'meaningless', 'collage', 'musicians', 'making', 'one', 'want', 'switch', 'off', 'screen', 'listen', 'music', 'only', 'Kudos.Abbado', 'Berlin', 'Japan', 'as', 'well', 'Abbado', 'conducting', 'Caracas', 'seem', 'far', 'more', 'lively', 'spirited', 'bring', 'out', 'essence', 'Tchaikovsky', 'interpretations', 'one', 'nowhere', 'other', 'Russian', 'greats', 'old', 'Rozhdestvensky', 'Mravinsky', 'recordings', 'audio', 'interpretation', 'one', 'other', 'benchmarks', 'Ormandy/Philiadelphia', 'ones', '.Given', 'choice', 'dont', 'think', 'would', 'recommend', ""'worth"", 'buy', 'stuff']",N/A
