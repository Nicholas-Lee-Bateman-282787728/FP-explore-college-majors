41315,AU78WGAXA3IY1,0782009123,"Chelle ""Chelle""","[225, 231]","Wanting something new in the vampire genre, I went on a search for films and came across Kindred: The Embraced. It seemed vaguely familiar. After viewing it, I realized that I had seen the initial episode when it originally aired, but when I purchased it I did so thinking I was doing it sight unseen.I've since watched all eight episodes and can say that I am not disappointed. The fact that this series was based on sets of role playing novels is a mark in its favor. I say this because the series is not about the blood aspect of vampires or, as they are here, the Kindred. There is indeed action, tame violence, but if you're looking for gore and aggression, if that's what you want out of your vampire film experience, Kindred: The Embraced is not the place you`ll find it.What this series focuses on is the community that the clans of the Kindred have made for themselves, the peace they have forged to live without fear amongst humans. They have a set of laws designed to guard the Masquerade, a grand scheme to hide their identity from the world, and they have a prince to enforce those laws. That prince is Julian Luna, played by Mark Frankel, and he is the ultimate strength of the series.The character of Julian Luna is a complex one. His sense of humanity has the potential to clash dangerously with his responsibility towards the clans. He is aware of what he must do, but knows that it comes with a price, whether it be for his people or for himself specifically. And his struggle to tread that line is where the emotion lies for the viewer. Frankel was a wonderful choice for the role of Julian Luna. He is, in many respects, the quintessential vampire--beautiful, charismatic, elegant and lethal.My favorite episode is the last, ""Cabin in the Woods.""  Therein lies the potential of the show. Julian's character has started to peak, we begin to see what he is capable of, and it is bittersweet to know that nothing will follow. It would have been remarkable to see what direction this show would have taken.Certain aspects are not entirely realistic, such as the premise behind C. Thomas Howell's character, but it is easy to take that as a first season fault. And, really, it may also be because of the depth they were aiming for, which, if that is the case, is most forgivable.The only thing that I did not appreciate was how the DVDs were put together. Credits run before and after every episode. Within each you get long pauses where commercials no doubt were and they are preceded with the name of the show against a black backdrop. I don't see the necessity of keeping the shows in the original format, but since I own no other TV series to DVD set perhaps this is not so specific to Kindred.If you are thinking about buying Kindred: The Embraced without having seen it, with little knowledge of the background or the series in general, there is, in my opinion, scarce need for debating the matter. I bought it on impulse (a rarity, actually, for me) and it paid off. It's not all I've ever looked for in the vampire genre, but it fulfills some of my requirements and I not only enjoy it, but am most glad I now own it.",4,Glad I now own it!,1032048000,"09 15, 2002",2002,3140,"['Wanting', 'something', 'new', 'vampire', 'genre', 'went', 'search', 'films', 'came', 'Kindred', 'Embraced', 'seemed', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'viewing', 'realized', 'had', 'seen', 'initial', 'episode', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'when', 'purchased', 'did', 'so', 'thinking', 'was', 'doing', 'sight', 'unseen.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'eight', 'episodes', 'can', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'series', 'was', 'based', 'sets', 'role', 'playing', 'novels', 'mark', 'favor', 'say', 'series', 'not', 'blood', 'aspect', 'vampires', 'are', 'here', 'Kindred', 'indeed', 'action', 'tame', 'violence', ""'re"", 'looking', 'gore', 'aggression', 'what', 'want', 'vampire', 'film', 'experience', 'Kindred', 'Embraced', 'not', 'place', 'll', 'find', 'it.What', 'series', 'community', 'clans', 'Kindred', 'have', 'made', 'peace', 'have', 'forged', 'live', 'fear', 'amongst', 'humans', 'have', 'set', 'laws', 'designed', 'guard', 'Masquerade', 'grand', 'scheme', 'hide', 'identity', 'world', 'have', 'prince', 'enforce', 'laws', 'prince', 'Julian', 'Luna', 'played', 'Mark', 'Frankel', 'ultimate', 'strength', 'series.The', 'character', 'Julian', 'Luna', 'complex', 'one', 'sense', 'humanity', 'potential', 'clash', 'dangerously', 'responsibility', 'clans', 'aware', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'price', 'be', 'people', 'specifically', 'struggle', 'tread', 'line', 'where', 'emotion', 'viewer', 'Frankel', 'was', 'wonderful', 'choice', 'role', 'Julian', 'Luna', 'many', 'respects', 'quintessential', 'vampire', 'beautiful', 'charismatic', 'elegant', 'lethal.My', 'favorite', 'episode', 'last', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'Therein', 'potential', 'show', 'Julian', 'character', 'started', 'peak', 'begin', 'see', 'what', 'capable', 'bittersweet', 'know', 'nothing', 'will', 'follow', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'remarkable', 'see', 'what', 'direction', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'taken.Certain', 'aspects', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'realistic', 'such', 'premise', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'character', 'easy', 'take', 'first', 'season', 'fault', 'really', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'depth', 'were', 'aiming', 'case', 'most', 'forgivable.The', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'was', 'how', 'DVDs', 'were', 'put', 'together', 'Credits', 'run', 'before', 'episode', 'get', 'long', 'pauses', 'where', 'commercials', 'doubt', 'were', 'are', 'preceded', 'name', 'show', 'black', 'backdrop', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'necessity', 'keeping', 'shows', 'original', 'format', 'own', 'other', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'set', 'perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'specific', 'Kindred.If', 'are', 'thinking', 'buying', 'Kindred', 'Embraced', 'having', 'seen', 'little', 'knowledge', 'background', 'series', 'general', 'opinion', 'scarce', 'need', 'debating', 'matter', 'bought', 'impulse', 'rarity', 'actually', 'paid', 'off', 'not', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'looked', 'vampire', 'genre', 'requirements', 'not', 'only', 'enjoy', 'am', 'most', 'glad', 'now', 'own']",N/A

While the inner politics that the show promotes and explores slightly is fascinating, unfortunately the show was peppered with genre actors turning in relatively predictable performances.  Still, I would imagine that the show is 'must-see-TV' for die-hard blood sucking enthusiasts, as the show had a strong sense of novelty in exploring the mythology surrounding vampires from a different point of view.On a low note, C. Thomas Howell turns in perhaps the most wooden performance of his career.  Perhaps he was intended to be the figuative 'stake' in the heart of this series' chest, had it a larger body of work.On a high note, Mark Frankel as 'Julian' turns in a remarkable performance as Julian Luna, the prince of the clains.  While he oozes the kind of chemistry one would come to expect from the head of the blood-sucking cults, he also peppers his scenes with feelings of true angst and amusement over the uniqueness of his situation and position in society.  Also worth mentioning is Kelly Rutherford (can't this beauty find a series that lasts more than one season?) and her performance as the city editor bent on uncovering the truth behind San Francisco's bloody crimes but slowly falling in love with Julian in the process.The DVD edition is a well-done preservation of this series, and, while it doesn't answer all of the questions raised in eight episodes (the show wasn't picked up as the lead Frankel was killed tragically in an auto accident), it definitely gives the viewer some wonderful points to ponder.",2,Average-Level Bloodsucking,1021852800,"05 20, 2002",2002,1955,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'have', 'experience', 'Mark', 'Rein-Hagen', 'book', 'VAMPIRE', 'MASQUERADE', 'short-lived', 'series', 'based', 'viewing', 'eight', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'convinced', ""'d"", 'want', 'run', 'out', 'involve', 'EMBRACED', 'just-above-average', 'TV', 'fare', 'exploring', 'volatile', 'nature', 'Mafia-like', 'families', 'ancient', 'Vampire', 'clans', 'inner', 'politics', 'show', 'slightly', 'fascinating', 'unfortunately', 'show', 'was', 'peppered', 'genre', 'actors', 'turning', 'relatively', 'predictable', 'performances', 'Still', 'would', 'imagine', 'show', ""'must-see-TV"", 'die-hard', 'blood', 'sucking', 'enthusiasts', 'show', 'had', 'strong', 'sense', 'novelty', 'exploring', 'mythology', 'surrounding', 'vampires', 'different', 'point', 'view.On', 'low', 'note', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'perhaps', 'most', 'wooden', 'performance', 'career', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'figuative', ""'stake"", 'heart', 'series', 'chest', 'had', 'larger', 'body', 'work.On', 'high', 'note', 'Mark', 'Frankel', ""'Julian"", 'turns', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'Julian', 'Luna', 'prince', 'clains', 'kind', 'chemistry', 'one', 'would', 'come', 'expect', 'head', 'blood-sucking', 'cults', 'also', 'scenes', 'feelings', 'true', 'angst', 'amusement', 'uniqueness', 'situation', 'position', 'society', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Kelly', 'Rutherford', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beauty', 'find', 'series', 'more', 'one', 'season', 'performance', 'city', 'editor', 'bent', 'uncovering', 'truth', 'San', 'Francisco', 'bloody', 'crimes', 'slowly', 'falling', 'love', 'Julian', 'process.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'well-done', 'preservation', 'series', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'raised', 'eight', 'episodes', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'picked', 'up', 'lead', 'Frankel', 'was', 'killed', 'tragically', 'auto', 'accident', 'definitely', 'viewer', 'wonderful', 'points', 'ponder']",N/A

This game line rules all and I defy anyone to find a game that is darker, more realistic and better produced. That being said. What was this .... Don't get me wrong I have this Dvd and the VHS mostly because it's the only way I can see the masquerade on tv without it being on the news with some kid killing his parents and you know what I'm talking about. I'm with those of you who picked this show apart. Where are the other clans? Where are the disciplines? and when, Caine tell me when did gang and gangrel become the same thing? The Brujah were punks and not in a good way. The Toreador were the only clan that actually fit the game standards. The Nosferatu were actually pretty nice looking and yes I know that sounds bad. Where were the Tremere and my beloved Malkavians. Now I did like the idea of them being able to walk by day, I use that in my game sessions but the rest was just .... While Sasha the brujah girl was ... she was just so annoying. We know she's Brujah can she shut up about it all ready. Julian while cool to look at he had the look of a prince but he would not be able to survive he would have gotten torn apart but the Anarchs or other Primogen along time ago. That brings me to Eddie Fiori the Brujah Primogen. I know this is getting long but come on. Can you say dead man along time ago boys and girls. You attack the Prince's bodyguard, your turn the Prince's granddaughter, you defy the Prince on numerous occassions and yet that ... was still walking. Julian should have put him down like a dog in the Primogen room in front of everyone. Okay pretty rough but I take the masquerade very seriously and yes I know it's a roleplaying game so don't bother to point that out.

41330,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,0782009123,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 17]","The horror genre has had a spotty track record on television. Aside from anthology series that introduced a new tale of woe every week, most entries that dabbled in supernatural or monster themes were often more beloved than popular. I know it seems hard to imagine now with the revitalized interest in everything supernatural. Vampires, wolves, ghosts, zombies and other beasties rule the airwaves (although still mostly beyond network TV) on premium cable, CW, AMC, FX, and BBCAmerica among others. I think that's why we still remember the programs that defied conventional wisdom, that attempted something different in trying to tie an on-going mythology to the serialized drama. Sure daytime had ""Dark Shadows,"" but for every ""X-Files"" or ""Buffy"" that turned into monster cult hits, there were many more that simply vanished without a trace. Even the show that absolutely set the standard in my opinion, ""Kolchak"" couldn't stay on the air for more than one season in 1974-75 despite a series of successful TV movies.  By no means meant to be a comprehensive list, here is just a few shows with supernatural leanings that failed to cross over to big success:Werewolf (1987), Lasted One SeasonEerie, Indiana (1991), Creepiness for kids, lasted one seasonAmerican Gothic (1995), Small town craziness, lasted one seasonMillennium (1996-99) and Lone Gunmen (2001), shorter-lived X-files offshootsWolf Lake (2001), Werewolves, lasted nine episodesI guess that makes this a perfect time to revisit the short-lived and ill-fated ""Kindred: The Embraced"" from 1996. Inspired by the wildly popular Role Playing Game ""Vampire: The Masquerade,"" the show met with some initial skepticism from fans of the game.  Not meant to be a literal translation, but instead influenced by the concept and environment of the video sensation, some were disappointed by what was perceived as a lack of faithfulness to the source.  Never a particular ratings juggernaut for FOX, this Aaron Spelling production quickly faced cancellation and its fate was further sealed when one of its leading actors (Mark Frankel) perished in an unfortunate motorcycle accident.  It's a shame, too.  While I won't proclaim the show to be as fantastic as some, it was decidedly different, had an appealing cast, good production values, and an incredibly intriguing premise.  While its Pilot lacked some punch (being both overcrowded and somewhat confusing), subsequent episodes got stronger and stronger.  But with only eight episodes in the can, it feels somewhat incomplete (as you might expect).  Therefore, this release will likely appeal more for a nostalgia factor than to win new fans.The basic premise of ""Kindred: The Embraced"" revolved around five major vampire clans.  Set in San Francisco, these disparate clans navigate life in the modern world (to varying degrees of success) by maintaining an illusion of humanity.  A local cop (C. Thomas Howell) uncovers this vampiric secret while investigating a powerful mob boss (Frankel) who happens to be a vampire leader trying to hold a supernatural war at bay.  The two form an uneasy alliance in the spirit of saving the city from utter annihilation.  Where the game was focused on clan politics and the complexities of this great environment, the TV show was of a much soapier nature with betrayals, love interests, and other very human concerns.  Frankel was a terrifically complex and interesting character, Howell was much more generic and this imbalance was quite notable.  With a cast that included Stacey Haiduk, Kelly Rutherford, Jeff Kober, my favorite was the great Patrick Bauchau as Archon Raine (a role I forever associated him with).What is most impressive about this DVD release is that it is NOT just a reissue of the previously released set as I had expected.  It is a full-on Collector's set with a handsome box and plenty of cool extras.  If you think fondly of the show, this is a fitting tribute.

41336,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,0782009123,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[77, 82]","Back in the Summer of 1996 (I think) I picked up on this series, which is based on the White Wolf role playing world of the Masquerade.  Within the bounds of that game various clans of vampires struggled with each other and their inner natures to maintain the secrecy if their existence.  For discovery would mean annihilation at the hands of the Earth's other dominant species - humanity.An entire industry and literature sprang up around the Masquerade, but it was still a surprise to find it playing on my TV set.  Even more remarkable was the overall quality of the series, which included an excellent cast led by Mark Frankel playing Julian, primogen of clan Ventrue and Prince of the city, and C. Thomas Hollowell as Frank Kohanek, the human detective who wanders into the night world.  Love interest is added by Kelly Rutherford, who plays a beautiful young human newspaperwoman.Much of the series focuses on the politics of the clans - Eddie Fiori, the Bruhah primogen is jealous of Julian's power and the struggle occupies some five of the eight episodes.  But there is plenty of room for horror, suspense, and romance as well.  All beautifully filmed, depending more on good settings and acting than special effects.Because vampires as main characters limit too much of the filming to the darkness, the film's writers deviated from the orthodox formula for a vampire.  They can wander in the light for short periods of time and still seem to have their reflections.  This isn't the only time this has been done, but Masquerade's rules are extremely traditional, and it's no surprise that fans of the game are unhappy with some factors of the program.  My personal feeling is that it underlines the idea that humans are never safe,But the program itself is excellent.  At the time it finished airing I assumed it was just a Summer trial balloon that would never reappear.  What I didn't know was that it had been a success and was scheduled for a full season when Mark Frankel was killed in an accident.  Since he had literally stolen the show, there was no easy way to continue.If you want to see what an adult vampire series could have been then pick up this set, which is available at a bargain price.

As the second star says, I don't like it. That doesn't mean others won't, but it's not for me. Why? A bit of background:Normally, I'm all for supernatural shows. I enjoyed the new Teen Wolf, watched Dresden Files twice and am currently making my way through Witchblade. I like vampire and werewolf movies, and vampire/werewolf movies. In particular, I like the lore behind Vampire the Masquerade, which this show is based on. So this isn't a case of a genre mismatched to the viewer.So what exactly turned me off?First of all, the acting. I can't put my finger on whether it was the writing or the acting, but I could barely get through some of the episodes, and stopped pretty shortly into it. It rates a C, and not in a good, campy-on-purpose way. More of a ""cast lacks conviction"" way. Does it get better? I don't know. Will I ever find out? Probably not.Second, it conveys nowhere near the depth or color of VTM's World of Darkness. It borrows names and rough concepts, but throws the rest of it out the window. If you want a decent expression of this IP off pen and paper, you'll have to look up some of the PC games or perhaps a book or two. I certainly am not aware of vampires traipsing about in broad daylight unscathed in this IP.Third, the plot is just anemic. None of the situations drew me in. Perhaps this is one of the reasons I was unable to grow attached to any of the characters, but it would be dishonest of me to say that the acting had no part in it. Cobbled together, it's just uninspiring.So, do I like anything about this box? Yes. The box itself is magnificent. Whoever designed the packaging did a brilliant, if imperfect job. When you open it, papers can fall out, forcing you to reinsert them and close the faux envelope to keep it all in place.

I love Vampires and I think Kindred portrays them very well. I read a lot of bad reviews before I bought this DVD so I was expecting it to be lousy. To my surprise it was very very good. The DVD collects all eight episodes of the short-lived series. The series tells the story of five different Vampire clans in San Francisco. The clans battle one another for power like mobs. They are united by Julian (the much missed Mark Frankel) the ""prince"" of all of the clans. Julian is faced with the task of uniting the clans in a truce over the course of the eight episodes. As the series moves forward the Clans attempts at peace are threatened more and more by the Brujah clan and its thug leader Eddie Fiori (Brian Thompson from ""Buffy"" and the X-Files). As the series draws to a close the Clans have a final battle with Fiori and his thugs in ""The Rise and Fall of Eddie Fiori"" and many issues are resolved.Kindred the Embraced is really great because it is the first show to really have mafia clan Vampires. I think the concept of Vampire Clans fighting a mafia-like war is really great. It pputs a new twist on the Vampire mythology and it makes the show really cool. I really can't understand why people didn't like the show more. If you love Vampires you should buy this DVD. It is really great.

Yes, this will be another breast-beating, teeth-gnashing session about a canceled show that I really loved and didn't even make it to the end of it's first season.  Now, if you told me that Aaron freakin' Spelling was producing a vampire show based on a role-playing game I would assume it would be terrible.  And I would be wrong.  This show was unique and fantastic.  It lasted all of 8 episodes, but has remained a favorite of mine over the years and I recently revisited it to see if it's held up.  While I still find the themes and concepts irresistible, I must say that there are some cracks I didn't notice before but overall I still say this was an amazing series and I still want more nearly a decade and a half after it's cancellation.  That's the highest possible praise, really.""Kindred"" centers around a secret vampire society in San Franciso consisting of five clans, each with their own inherent interests and inborn traits.  The protagonist and Prince of the city, Julian Luna -whose job is to keep the peace amongst the clans- belongs to the aristocratic Ventrue clan, who are legitimate businessmen.  His mistress is a Toreador, who are passionate and wildly artistic by nature.  The powerful Nosferatu clan are somewhat monstrous in appearance and stick to the shadows and underground since they cannot blend in with humans.  The Brujah clan are mobsters who want nothing more then to install one of their own as Prince; the villains of the piece.  The Gangrels closely resemble a street gang and are conatantly at the throats of the rival Brujahs. The Assamites only appear in a single episode as shape-shifting assassins, but don't appear to have a seat on the council, which is wierd.  The dynamic between the 5 main clans make for some fascinating intrigue that could have been much better fleshed-out given time.  There really is nothing else like this show and that really stinks because the characters and concepts are just great.The cast is an interesting bunch, featuring Mark Frankel in the lead role as Luna, who resembles a cross between Bela Lugosi and Michael Corleone.  His different colored eyes give him a unique and unsettling look that is very effective for the role.  The romantic interests are a predatory Stacy Haiduk and Melrose Place alum Kelly Rutherford, both of whom are strikingly gorgeous.  But my pick of the cast has got to be Brigid Brannagh/Walsh (who later would have a recurring role on Angel), as Luna's disfunctional niece.  I've harbored a crush on her for many years and it has not abated a bit.  It's a real shame she has struggled to find more then bit roles becasue she's got definite star potential in my opinion.  If nothing else, one is unlikely to forget her entrance in the pilot where she vulgarly kisses her deceased grandfather on the mouth at his funeral. Chick's crazy. Also prominently featured in the pilot is Kate Vernon, who would go on to a large role in Battlestar Galactica. But the cast is occasionally a problem as well and the acting performances in the show are occasionally bad enough to warrant unintentional comedy status.  But for the most part, the characters are likeable and relatable enough.Again, my revisitation was slightly less pleasurable then before becasue of some corny acting.  One episode in particular sort of bugged me because somebody let Spelling run wild with his love of awful soft rock music and the result leaves much to be desired.  Telling the tale of the world's lamest vampire rock star is not the best idea to begin with, but the show does a decent job with it in some aspects.  It's mostly the constant comparisons to people like Kurt Cobain and Jim Morrison that is likely to annoy music fans.  If the character really came off as a crazy rocker then it would be one thing, but the guy's performances and attitude are so tame and cheesy that it is really hard to take him seriously at all.  He seems like an American Idol contestant.  Thankfully, the rest of the cast does a great job and salvages the episode, but this is one example of why I would be leary of Spelling helming a show like this.  I prefer tales of baby-snatching devolved rogue Nosferatu and the like or even a good vampire mob shoot-out. The phosphorous guns are really cool due both to the old-school look of them and the flaming barrel each blast leaves behind.  Also, the use of vampire powers, though reserved, is intriguing.  The limits of each clan/individual's powers are never explained to the audience, but are revealed as each story calls for them which leaves a lot of mystery to the show's mythology.  I like that.Eight episodes is not a lot of room, but thankfully the show's first/last major arc completes on the sixth episode and the final two eps are pretty self-contained so there was not a lot left hanging in the air when the show was abruptly canceled.  Nonetheless, there was obviously no shortage of possible routes to go and stories to tell in the Kindred universe.  Not only did the show get canceled, but the DVD set is now out of print. However, there are some region-free copies here on Amazon and on certain reputable online auction sites, and I would suggest that vampire fanatics seriously think about finding a way to check this show out.  A little bit of bad acting should not keep you away from one of the most interesting vampire properties ever to grace the screen.  Can you think of another successful adaptation of a pen-and-paper RPG?  Okay, this probably doesn't count as ""successful"" in the traditional sense, but I am talking about entertainment value here and Kindred is not lacking in that.  Check it out, for sure.4 1/2 stars rounded up for old time's sake.",5,"""I knew we were going to get along when you ordered your steak very, very rare.""",1245715200,"06 23,

41358,A1DORQXHAAR8J9,0782009123,"William H. Kelsey ""seeker of truth""","[1, 3]","The ones were vampires follow the time honoured rules (no going in the sun, no eating, drinking, or reproduction, needing to drink blood in order to stay alive, etc) and the ""New Agey"" vampire who seems to have no rules, fewer weaknesses, seems completely human, does not have to drink blood, etc. If you're like me, you'll prefer ""Forever Knight"" to this series precisely because, unlike ""Forever Knight"", this programme does not follow anything close to the classic vampire mythology. Now, I know some people are going to say, ""But it's just fantasy. It doesn't have to have rules"", but the backbone of the scifi/fantasy genre is that one is working with an established (or, as in the case of Star Wars/Trek, the authors are establishing their own myths) mythology that tells the viewer how exactly this world and this society differs from the mundane human world. For instance, in this miniseries, the vampires have no problem going in the sun, can be killed with bullets, eat, drink, and have sex. All of these go against the classic myths. Why is that important? Well, for one, because the restrictions show that vampires have paid a heavy price for immorality. They can no longer enjoy the carnal pleasures that we common humans do. The Kindred seem to have paid no price beyond not being able to reproduce (which, I guess when considering films like ""Blade"" they are staying closer to the myth than many, but still it's not enough). Also, basic biology will tell you that in order to eat, drink, and have sex, cells must forever be born and die in order to break down food and to create reproductive fluids. Now, if these vampires have that process occuring, they could not possibly be immortal because the process of celluar aging and rebirth is called aging. You eat food, the body breaks it down to create new cells, and the old ones die. Why the writers of this series couldn't figure that out is beyond me.Let me make a few things clear: one, I have never played the game upon which this series is based. If you are a player and have seen that the rules of the game match up well with the series then please let me know. Secondly, I am a major ""Forever Knight"" fan and really wanted to like this series, but it had none of the aspects that made FK great. No flashbacks, no existential crisis, no beautiful costumes, no amazing actors (Nigel Bennett is and forever will be the greatest actor to bring a vampire to life, and Lacroix is the most awesome vampire of all time), none of it. But clearly they had seen FK because there were some blantant ripoffs (the music club that Lily runs is called ""Haven"". The club Jeanette runs is called ""The Raven"". Coincidence? I think not). Thirdly, in its favour, some of the storylines are very good. I loved the creation of the Nosferatu and the various clans and their war. That was very interesting. The actor who played Julian is good, but no Nick Knight (the series' version Geraint Wyn Davis, not Rick Springfield). Other than Julian, the acting seemed rather stiff to me and many of the characters (Sasha being chief among them) were pretty one dimensional and lacking.Overall, while this series isn't horrible, it's not great either. If you're interested in buying this, check it out on SciFi channel before you do so that you know whether these are the type of vampires that will hold your interest. They didn't for me, but everyone has his own taste. Be warned, however, that if you want a truly fantastic vampire series, head over to ""Forever Knight"". I challenge anyone to find a vampire more compelling than Lacroix.",3,There Are Two Types of Vampire Tales,1221436800,"09 15, 2008",2008,3580,"['ones', 'were', 'vampires', 'follow', 'time', 'honoured', 'rules', 'going', 'sun', 'eating', 'drinking', 'reproduction', 'needing', 'drink', 'blood', 'order', 'stay', 'alive', 'etc', 'New', 'Agey', 'vampire', 'who', 'have', 'rules', 'fewer', 'weaknesses', 'completely', 'human', 'not', 'have', 'drink', 'blood', 'etc', ""'re"", ""'ll"", 'prefer', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'series', 'precisely', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'programme', 'not', 'follow', 'anything', 'close', 'classic', 'vampire', 'mythology', 'Now', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'say', 'just', 'fantasy', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'rules', 'backbone', 'scifi/fantasy', 'genre', 'one', 'working', 'established', 'case', 'Star', 'Wars/Trek', 'authors', 'are', 'establishing', 'own', 'myths', 'mythology', 'viewer', 'how', 'exactly', 'world', 'society', 'differs', 'mundane', 'human', 'world', 'instance', 'miniseries', 'vampires', 'have', 'problem', 'going', 'sun', 'can', 'be', 'killed', 'bullets', 'eat', 'drink', 'have', 'sex', 'go', 'classic', 'myths', 'Why', 'important', 'Well', 'one', 'restrictions', 'show', 'vampires', 'have', 'paid', 'heavy', 'price', 'immorality', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'enjoy', 'carnal', 'pleasures', 'common', 'humans', 'do', 'Kindred', 'seem', 'have', 'paid', 'price', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'reproduce', 'guess', 'when', 'considering', 'films', 'Blade', 'are', 'staying', 'closer', 'myth', 'many', 'still', 'not', 'enough', 'Also', 'basic', 'biology', 'will', 'tell', 'order', 'eat', 'drink', 'have', 'sex', 'cells', 'must', 'forever', 'be', 'born', 'die', 'order', 'break', 'down', 'food', 'create', 'reproductive', 'fluids', 'Now', 'vampires', 'have', 'process', 'occuring', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'immortal', 'process', 'celluar', 'aging', 'rebirth', 'called', 'aging', 'eat', 'food', 'body', 'down', 'create', 'new', 'cells', 'old', 'ones', 'die', 'Why', 'writers', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'me.Let', 'make', 'few', 'things', 'clear', 'one', 'have', 'never', 'played', 'game', 'series', 'based', 'are', 'player', 'have', 'seen', 'rules', 'game', 'match', 'up', 'well', 'series', 'then', 'please', 'let', 'know', 'Secondly', 'am', 'major', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'fan', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'series', 'had', 'none', 'aspects', 'made', 'FK', 'great', 'flashbacks', 'existential', 'crisis', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'amazing', 'actors', 'Nigel', 'Bennett', 'forever', 'will', 'be', 'greatest', 'actor', 'bring', 'vampire', 'life', 'Lacroix', 'most', 'awesome', 'vampire', 'time', 'none', 'clearly', 'had', 'seen', 'FK', 'were', 'blantant', 'ripoffs', 'music', 'club', 'Lily', 'called', 'Haven', 'club', 'Jeanette', 'called', 'Raven', 'Coincidence', 'think', 'not', 'Thirdly', 'favour', 'storylines', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'loved', 'creation', 'Nosferatu', 'various', 'clans', 'war', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Julian', 'good', 'Nick', 'Knight', 'series', 'version', 'Geraint', 'Wyn', 'Davis', 'not', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'Other', 'Julian', 'acting', 'seemed', 'rather', 'stiff', 'many', 'characters', 'Sasha', 'being', 'chief', 'were', 'pretty', 'one', 'dimensional', 'lacking.Overall', 'series', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'not', 'great', 'either', ""'re"", 'interested', 'buying', 'check', 'out', 'SciFi', 'channel', 'do', 'so', 'know', 'are', 'type', 'vampires', 'will', 'hold', 'interest', 'did', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'own', 'taste', 'Be', 'warned', 'however', 'want', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'vampire', 'series', 'head', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'challenge', 'anyone', 'find', 'vampire', 'more', 'compelling', 'Lacroix']",N/A

Oh yeah, and the lead actor got into a motor cycle accident and was decapitated (strange but true).  Lord knows Spelling, who brought us such classics as 90210 and the Love Boat, would have made much more of this if he had time.  However, time was taken away when 90% of the viewers changed channels during the opening credits.I am not trying to slam this video.  And I am glad that I bought it for the games I play.
