There are two performers that make this movie and they are Adrian Martinez and the guy who plays that crew member's father, they make this movie just right and allow us to feel silly, and awkward right along with them even though they do things we might not do.  That's another thing about this film, it goes where a Hollywood film would fear to go without comic relief immediately diffusing the drama while still containing drama and lines that aren't exactly punchlines, but they come off hilariously anyway.  Kudos to the filmmakers who truly have created one of the best independant films in that past few years. To let those who want to know a little more about this film, it's shot in a mock-documentary style so you get the feel that you're actually watching the material shot by the fictional documentary filmmaker in the film.

927405,AKYNIMNI8LOBP,B000AL72RI,"Mr. Richard K. Weems ""emperor_weems""","[13, 13]","This movie is a classic example of how a great movie is not made by star power or cgi effects, but by a solid premise and splendid execution._Mail Order Wife_ is a movie about Andrew, a young and arrogant filmmaker, who decides he'd like to make a documentary about Adrian, an NYC boy who has decided to order himself a mail order bride.  An immediate problem is presented when Andrew helps pay for Lichi, the Burmese woman, and brings up a classic dilemma about moviemaking also addressed in great films like _Man Bits Dog_--Andrew is already showing signs of getting involved with his subject matter a little too subjectively.  This is reinforced after Lichi arrives and Adrian turns out to be much less than an ideal husband, and Andrew decides that he needs to rescue this woman from an awful situation.This may sound like the premise of a light, romantic comedy, or a hackneyed Lifetime made-for-TV, but what I revealed so far is only the first 30 minutes of this 90-minute film, because things don't move along so easily, and that's because these characters aren't easily categorizable, which is also a sign of strong filmmaking.  Andrew has his own problems, with an inordinate sense of 'normalcy' and an arrogance streak that leaves him, in his own mind, justified in everything he does.  Adrian, though a twisted man, is somehow charmingly simple.  And Lichi isn't simply a quiet, victimized Asian girl, but one who has her own ulterior motives._Mail Order Wife_ is a comedy with dark undertones--there are wonderfully subtle moves, like how Andrew is always carrying his director's notebook even when involved in 'personal' conversations, and (you've seen it in the credits above) a surprising appearance by Jose Canseco, but these are also very troubling characters, played by unfamiliar actors to help make the mock-documentary motif seem all the more plausible.  The movie takes many unpredictable and sensible turns, that makes 90 minutes feel like a satisfyingly large glimpse into these people's lives.I would highly recommend this film to many, and I relish in the fact that such a small budget can result in such a wonderful endeavor.",5,a strong film,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,2152,"['movie', 'classic', 'example', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'made', 'star', 'power', 'cgi', 'effects', 'solid', 'premise', 'splendid', 'execution._Mail', 'Order', 'Wife_', 'movie', 'Andrew', 'young', 'arrogant', 'filmmaker', 'who', ""'d"", 'like', 'make', 'documentary', 'Adrian', 'NYC', 'boy', 'who', 'decided', 'order', 'mail', 'order', 'bride', 'immediate', 'problem', 'presented', 'when', 'Andrew', 'pay', 'Lichi', 'Burmese', 'woman', 'up', 'classic', 'dilemma', 'moviemaking', 'also', 'addressed', 'great', 'films', '_Man', 'Bits', 'Dog_', 'Andrew', 'already', 'showing', 'signs', 'getting', 'involved', 'subject', 'matter', 'little', 'too', 'subjectively', 'reinforced', 'Lichi', 'arrives', 'Adrian', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'ideal', 'husband', 'Andrew', 'rescue', 'woman', 'awful', 'situation.This', 'may', 'sound', 'premise', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'hackneyed', 'Lifetime', 'made-for-TV', 'what', 'revealed', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'first', '30', 'minutes', '90-minute', 'film', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'move', 'along', 'so', 'easily', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'easily', 'categorizable', 'also', 'sign', 'strong', 'filmmaking', 'Andrew', 'own', 'problems', 'inordinate', 'sense', ""'normalcy"", 'arrogance', 'streak', 'own', 'mind', 'justified', 'everything', 'Adrian', 'twisted', 'man', 'somehow', 'charmingly', 'simple', 'Lichi', ""n't"", 'simply', 'quiet', 'victimized', 'Asian', 'girl', 'one', 'who', 'own', 'ulterior', 'motives._Mail', 'Order', 'Wife_', 'comedy', 'dark', 'undertones', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'subtle', 'moves', 'how', 'Andrew', 'always', 'carrying', 'director', 'notebook', 'even', 'when', 'involved', ""'personal"", 'conversations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'credits', 'surprising', 'appearance', 'Jose', 'Canseco', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'troubling', 'characters', 'played', 'unfamiliar', 'actors', 'help', 'make', 'mock-documentary', 'motif', 'seem', 'more', 'plausible', 'movie', 'many', 'unpredictable', 'sensible', 'turns', '90', 'minutes', 'feel', 'satisfyingly', 'large', 'glimpse', 'people', 'lives.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'many', 'relish', 'fact', 'small', 'budget', 'can', 'result', 'such', 'wonderful', 'endeavor']",Mail Order Wife
927406,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B000AL72RI,Paul McGrath,"[5, 8]","That America has suffered a drastic decline in moral values or even basic decency over the last twenty years or so is so obvious that it can hardly be debated.  Hollywood, naturally, hasn't seemed to notice, but as Hollywood is obviously part of the problem, this is not exactly surprising.  It is therefore nice to see a film which consciously tackles this theme and delightful that it is so well done.It is a pseudo-documentary:  the story of a schlubby New York doorman who decides to marry a mail-order bride, and the wannabe filmmaker who documents it and whose film it is that tells the story.  Immediately we see that the doorman's goals are less than noble:  he wastes no time in using the pathetic-looking, meek Burmese girl to make tawdry pornographic films in his basement and with his huge, grotesque-looking snake.  Appalled at this awful behavior, the noble film-maker spirits her away one day and brings her into his own home, blithely basking in his magnanimity as he uses her as his personal cook, maid, and bed-mate, all the while maintaining the relationship with his girlfriend.Well, the girl gets sick of this and returns to the doorman, who begins using her again, but before long the filmmaker finally decides to make things right, once and for all.  He convinces her to leave with him by promising to love her and to marry her.But now the girl has started to learn some English, and our friend realizes that she maybe isn't such a bargain after all.  ""I want baby, I want baby, I WANT BABY!"" she screams at him.  She spends her entire allowance every week buying little pig figurines.  Ceramic pigs, plastic pigs, clay pigs, wood pigs.  ""Why are you wasting your money?"" he asks her.  ""I spend my money the way I want!"" she shrieks.  ""And beside, you spend your money on porn!""  ""But you have way more pigs than I have porn!"" he protests.  A very telling comment;  the girl has hundreds of little pigs.Well, she finally leaves him and both of them for good and about eight months later the lads discover her ad in a newer mail-order bride guide, and the rest of the story is their tragicomic plan for revenge.  Yeah.  Revenge.The film is crisply acted, carefully directed, and utterly engrossing, not at least because of the numerous cringe-inducing, uncomfortable moments it produces.  At the same time, however, the film is often quite funny.  Of course, cultural misunderstandings have often been a source of amusement in American film, but fifty years ago such concepts revolved around how far the zany Lucy would go in order to sing in the hot-tempered Ricky's band.  Nowadays, apparently, the misunderstandings stem from what level of degradation seemingly normal, law-abiding, yet decadent Americans will force upon their compliant, helpless victims.It is very thought-provoking and in the end a sad commentary on what Americans have allowed themselves to become.",5,Pigs,1153872000,"07 26, 2006",2006,2894,"['America', 'suffered', 'drastic', 'decline', 'moral', 'values', 'even', 'basic', 'decency', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'so', 'so', 'obvious', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'debated', 'Hollywood', 'naturally', ""n't"", 'seemed', 'notice', 'Hollywood', 'obviously', 'part', 'problem', 'not', 'exactly', 'surprising', 'therefore', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'consciously', 'theme', 'delightful', 'so', 'well', 'done.It', 'pseudo-documentary', 'story', 'schlubby', 'New', 'York', 'doorman', 'who', 'marry', 'mail-order', 'bride', 'wannabe', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'documents', 'film', 'story', 'Immediately', 'see', 'doorman', 'goals', 'are', 'less', 'noble', 'time', 'using', 'pathetic-looking', 'meek', 'Burmese', 'girl', 'make', 'tawdry', 'pornographic', 'films', 'basement', 'huge', 'grotesque-looking', 'snake', 'Appalled', 'awful', 'behavior', 'noble', 'film-maker', 'spirits', 'away', 'one', 'day', 'own', 'home', 'blithely', 'basking', 'magnanimity', 'personal', 'cook', 'maid', 'bed-mate', 'while', 'maintaining', 'relationship', 'girlfriend.Well', 'girl', 'sick', 'doorman', 'who', 'using', 'again', 'long', 'filmmaker', 'finally', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'once', 'leave', 'promising', 'love', 'marry', 'her.But', 'now', 'girl', 'started', 'learn', 'English', 'friend', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'such', 'bargain', 'want', 'baby', 'want', 'baby', 'WANT', 'BABY', 'entire', 'allowance', 'week', 'buying', 'little', 'pig', 'figurines', 'Ceramic', 'pigs', 'plastic', 'pigs', 'clay', 'pigs', 'wood', 'pigs', 'Why', 'are', 'wasting', 'money', 'spend', 'money', 'way', 'want', 'beside', 'spend', 'money', 'porn', 'have', 'way', 'more', 'pigs', 'have', 'porn', 'very', 'telling', 'comment', 'girl', 'hundreds', 'little', 'pigs.Well', 'finally', 'good', 'eight', 'months', 'later', 'lads', 'ad', 'newer', 'mail-order', 'bride', 'guide', 'rest', 'story', 'tragicomic', 'plan', 'revenge', 'Yeah', 'Revenge.The', 'film', 'crisply', 'acted', 'carefully', 'directed', 'utterly', 'engrossing', 'not', 'least', 'numerous', 'cringe-inducing', 'uncomfortable', 'moments', 'same', 'time', 'however', 'film', 'often', 'quite', 'funny', 'course', 'cultural', 'misunderstandings', 'have', 'often', 'been', 'source', 'amusement', 'American', 'film', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'such', 'concepts', 'revolved', 'how', 'far', 'zany', 'Lucy', 'would', 'go', 'order', 'sing', 'hot-tempered', 'Ricky', 'band', 'Nowadays', 'apparently', 'misunderstandings', 'stem', 'what', 'level', 'degradation', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'law-abiding', 'yet', 'decadent', 'Americans', 'will', 'force', 'compliant', 'helpless', 'victims.It', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'end', 'sad', 'commentary', 'what', 'Americans', 'have', 'allowed', 'become']",Mail Order Wife

At first, I accepted the film's premise that it's a documentary about ""Lichi,"" a mail-order bride from a poor 3rd world country (in this case, Burma) and Adrian, an overweight, lonely NYC doorman who orders her from a catalog.  Adrian initially appears to be a bit ignorant and unattractive, but an earnest, hard-working and decent guy.  However, after Lichi's arrival and quick marriage to him, events take a subtly dark and increasingly-abusive turn.  At several points, I wondered if some scenes, events and dialog weren't a bit staged -- would people really act out so openly in front of a camera crew?  More implausibilities kept cropping up, from minor details (i.e. why does Lichi -- a supposedly poorly-educated, destitute girl from rural Burma -- speak fluent Chinese in Chinatown?) to major plot issues (the build-up to a Jerry Springer-like finale).  Early on, I began to wonder how a theatre audience would react: women likely would howl over the overt exploitation, and human beings with a heart would recoil at the growing manipulation and opportunism, perversity, and heartache.  The film reeled me in and hooked me quite effectively: the unknown degree of truth kept me engrossed -- laughing, cringing, and wondering could this be at all true?Net: As fiction, it's perversely entertaining.  As a film, it's controversial, and worth seeing.

The husband to be is a slob, rude, and has pretty much no friends, which is equal to his love life...or lack thereof. the guy documenting this offers to pay for the wife and her plane ticket. when she gets over, she can speak very little english, but fulfills her wife dities like a stepford wife. as the filming goes on, the ordered wife tells the filmer that her husband ties her up and takes pictures of her for the internet, and other disgusting things that she doesn't want to do. at this point, the documenter and the ordered wife have a close bond that is a little more than freindly. they have a little something, and hey try to get seperated from the husband.she ends up playing them both and goes back to her country where she appears on another Mail Order Wife website/company.Its confusing because i'm still not sure if this was a real documentary that went array, or a film with a script and a little improv.anyway, its good. go rent it.",5,Documentary or Fiction Film?,1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,1163,"['movie', 'weird', 'confusing', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'tv.Its', 'guy', 'doing', 'documentary', 'process', 'man', 'ordering', 'wife', 'foreign', 'country', 'husband', 'be', 'slob', 'rude', 'pretty', 'much', 'friends', 'equal', 'love', 'life', 'lack', 'thereof', 'guy', 'documenting', 'pay', 'wife', 'plane', 'ticket', 'when', 'over', 'can', 'speak', 'very', 'little', 'english', 'wife', 'dities', 'stepford', 'wife', 'filming', 'ordered', 'wife', 'filmer', 'husband', 'up', 'pictures', 'internet', 'other', 'disgusting', 'things', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'point', 'documenter', 'ordered', 'wife', 'have', 'close', 'bond', 'little', 'more', 'freindly', 'have', 'little', 'something', 'hey', 'try', 'get', 'seperated', 'husband.she', 'up', 'playing', 'back', 'country', 'where', 'Mail', 'Order', 'Wife', 'website/company.Its', 'confusing', 'i', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'real', 'documentary', 'went', 'array', 'film', 'script', 'little', 'improv.anyway', 'good', 'go', 'rent']",Mail Order Wife
927412,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B000AL72RI,Zack Davisson,"[2, 2]","Unlike most viewers, I have had some personal experience with this subject, so I knew right off the bat that it wasn't the real documentary it tries to sell itself as.  I didn't order my wife from a catalog, and we lived together for several years in her country before moving to the US to get married, but I know for a fact it isn't nearly that easy to bring a fianc&eacute; over from Asia!  The interviews, proof of real relationship, endless forms and background checks...it takes a lot of time and a lot of money, and isn't the casual thing portrayed here!So after seriously suspending my disbelief at the unrealistic premise, I enjoyed ""Mail Order Wife"" much more than I was expecting to. In fact, everything about it was not what I was expecting.  Even knowing the nature of the film, it manages to keep you on your toes, give you that uncomfortable feeling of not knowing if you are supposed to laugh or be outraged, and then hitting you with scenes so funny you have to stop the DVD because you are laughing so hard.The first portion of the film plays it totally straight.  A tubby and lonely doorman, Adrian, orders a wife, Lichi (brilliantly played by Eugenia Yuan, star ofThe Eye 2), from a catalog.  The whole process is paid for by Andrew, a documentary film maker who gets a little too involved in the subjects.  Adrian treats Lichi like a maid and a porn star, and she finally escapes and runs to the rescue of Andrew.  Things seem to be going well, but Andrew is not the nice guy that he seems, nor is Lichi content to be the subservient housewife.  At this point, the whole story takes a turn to the ridiculous, and any trickery about this being a real documentary goes out the window.  That's when the movie gets really good.Lichi is really the star of this show.  Eugenia Yuan is an amazing actress, who can effortless pull sympathetic tears or belly-busting guffaws from viewers.  To anyone who has seen the movie, all I have to say is ""pigs"" or ""baby"" to get you laughing again. The director and lead, Andrew, has apparently tried to balance his skills as a documentary filmmaker with his desire to have things turn out the way he would like to rather than the way they are.  A previous documentary of his, about Frat House hazing, was later discovered to be full of staged acts instead of the real thing.  With ""Mail Order Bride"" he gets to have the best of both worlds, while playing with the audience as well.To those in the know, there are some major flaws in the film, like the above mentioned ease with which Adrian acquires Lichi, and the fact that even though she is supposed to be from Burma she speaks Chinese.  But that is going to happen to any movie when you know too much about the subject, and it is time to just shut off that part of your brain.The DVD has some great extra features, included deleted scenes and audition tapes.  The deleted scenes are pretty funny, but it is easy to see why the director chose to take them out as they would give away the game too early.",4,More fun than a barrel of pigs,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,3008,"['most', 'viewers', 'have', 'had', 'personal', 'experience', 'subject', 'knew', 'right', 'bat', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'documentary', 'sell', 'did', ""n't"", 'order', 'wife', 'catalog', 'lived', 'together', 'several', 'years', 'country', 'moving', 'US', 'get', 'married', 'know', 'fact', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'easy', 'bring', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Asia', 'interviews', 'proof', 'real', 'relationship', 'endless', 'forms', 'background', 'checks', 'lot', 'time', 'lot', 'money', ""n't"", 'casual', 'thing', 'portrayed', 'here', 'So', 'seriously', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'unrealistic', 'premise', 'enjoyed', 'Mail', 'Order', 'Wife', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'expecting', 'fact', 'everything', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'Even', 'knowing', 'nature', 'film', 'keep', 'toes', 'give', 'uncomfortable', 'feeling', 'not', 'knowing', 'are', 'supposed', 'laugh', 'be', 'outraged', 'then', 'hitting', 'scenes', 'so', 'funny', 'have', 'stop', 'DVD', 'are', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard.The', 'first', 'portion', 'film', 'totally', 'straight', 'tubby', 'lonely', 'doorman', 'Adrian', 'orders', 'wife', 'Lichi', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Eugenia', 'Yuan', 'star', 'ofThe', 'Eye', '2', 'catalog', 'whole', 'process', 'paid', 'Andrew', 'documentary', 'film', 'maker', 'who', 'little', 'too', 'involved', 'subjects', 'Adrian', 'treats', 'Lichi', 'maid', 'porn', 'star', 'finally', 'escapes', 'rescue', 'Andrew', 'Things', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'Andrew', 'not', 'nice', 'guy', 'Lichi', 'content', 'be', 'subservient', 'housewife', 'point', 'whole', 'story', 'turn', 'ridiculous', 'trickery', 'being', 'real', 'documentary', 'out', 'window', 'when', 'movie', 'really', 'good.Lichi', 'really', 'star', 'show', 'Eugenia', 'Yuan', 'amazing', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'effortless', 'pull', 'sympathetic', 'tears', 'belly-busting', 'guffaws', 'viewers', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'pigs', 'baby', 'get', 'laughing', 'again', 'director', 'lead', 'Andrew', 'apparently', 'tried', 'balance', 'skills', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'desire', 'have', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'would', 'like', 'rather', 'way', 'are', 'previous', 'documentary', 'about', 'Frat', 'House', 'hazing', 'was', 'later', 'discovered', 'be', 'full', 'staged', 'acts', 'instead', 'real', 'thing', 'Mail', 'Order', 'Bride', 'have', 'best', 'worlds', 'playing', 'audience', 'well.To', 'know', 'are', 'major', 'flaws', 'film', 'above', 'mentioned', 'ease', 'Adrian', 'acquires', 'Lichi', 'fact', 'even', 'supposed', 'be', 'Burma', 'Chinese', 'going', 'happen', 'movie', 'when', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'subject', 'time', 'just', 'shut', 'off', 'part', 'brain.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'extra', 'features', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'audition', 'tapes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'director', 'chose', 'take', 'out', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'game', 'too', 'early']",Mail Order Wife
