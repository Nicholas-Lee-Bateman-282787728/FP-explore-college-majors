368122,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,630329328X,Andrew Raker,"[11, 12]","It is somewhat dishonest to call this a 'Lassie' film. This film never excited in me the same feelings as many of the older Lassie films. However, there are some positive aspects to this film.First, Lassie (1994) is considerably more contemporary than most 'Lassie' films yet has a collie as the hero. (This might interest children ages 8 through 13 who enjoy action and dogs.)Second, the film has a theme I appreciate - a theme of reaching out to others when others treat you cruely or degradingly.Third, the film kept my attention more than other Lassie films or films with canine stars.[While I enjoyed Old Yeller and Air Bud (1998), many dog films such as The Shaggy Dog (both 1959 and 2006), Where the Red Fern Grows, Shiloh, Far From Home, etc. either were incredible unrealistic or failed to keep my attention for long.]However, there is merit in the response, ""This film is too violent and uses foul language."" While this Lassie film is no Stand By Me or Jaws, it isn't Mr. Roger's Neighborhood either. Some words are included in this film that parents may not appreciate their five year olds hearing, and some scenes (while not very violent) have undertones that are more likely to 'scare' parents than children.I do not desire to give away the plot to the reader. However, the film begins with Lassie's real owner being killed in a tractor-trailer accident on wet roads. Based on this description, it is possible for the reader to further realize this is not a ""sugar-coated"" motion picture.Overall, I would recommend this film to parents who have allowed their children to view 101 Dalmatians (live action) and/or films such as To Kill a Mockingbird. However, for parents with young children, Lassie films such as Lassie Come Home (1943) and Lassie (2006) might be more children friendly.",4,Lassie Choices,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,1799,"['somewhat', 'dishonest', 'call', ""'Lassie"", 'film', 'film', 'never', 'excited', 'same', 'feelings', 'many', 'older', 'Lassie', 'films', 'However', 'are', 'positive', 'aspects', 'film.First', 'Lassie', '1994', 'considerably', 'more', 'contemporary', 'most', 'films', 'yet', 'collie', 'hero', 'might', 'interest', 'children', '8', '13', 'who', 'enjoy', 'action', 'dogs', 'Second', 'film', 'theme', 'appreciate', 'theme', 'reaching', 'out', 'others', 'when', 'others', 'treat', 'cruely', 'degradingly.Third', 'film', 'kept', 'attention', 'more', 'other', 'Lassie', 'films', 'films', 'canine', 'stars', '[', 'enjoyed', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'Air', 'Bud', '1998', 'many', 'dog', 'films', 'such', 'Shaggy', 'Dog', '1959', '2006', 'Where', 'Red', 'Fern', 'Grows', 'Shiloh', 'Far', 'From', 'Home', 'etc', 'were', 'incredible', 'unrealistic', 'failed', 'keep', 'attention', 'long', ']', 'However', 'merit', 'response', 'film', 'too', 'violent', 'foul', 'language', 'Lassie', 'film', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Jaws', ""n't"", 'Mr.', 'Roger', 'Neighborhood', 'words', 'are', 'included', 'film', 'parents', 'may', 'not', 'appreciate', 'five', 'year', 'olds', 'hearing', 'scenes', 'not', 'very', 'violent', 'have', 'undertones', 'are', 'more', 'likely', ""'scare"", 'parents', 'children.I', 'do', 'not', 'desire', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'reader', 'However', 'film', 'Lassie', 'real', 'owner', 'being', 'killed', 'tractor-trailer', 'accident', 'wet', 'roads', 'Based', 'description', 'possible', 'reader', 'further', 'realize', 'not', 'sugar-coated', 'motion', 'picture.Overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'allowed', 'children', 'view', '101', 'Dalmatians', 'live', 'action', 'and/or', 'films', 'such', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'However', 'parents', 'young', 'children', 'Lassie', 'films', 'such', 'Lassie', 'Come', 'Home', '1943', 'Lassie', '2006', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'children', 'friendly']",Lassie VHS

And naturally, our main character, the dog, is gorgeous. What Lassie isn't? So a basic plot, a predictable ending, but touching at some parts, and good enough to keep your screaming toddlers and younger kids occupied.

The bitterness and resentment, as well as the goodness, deep inside of Matt's heart, are realisically portayed as he relates to his Dad, his sister, and Laura, his step-mom. Lassie, a stray the family takes in, soon finds her way into the withdrawn boy's heart, and helps him change into the responsible, intelligent, and warmhearted young man he was meant to be. But their new-life in the country threatens to unravel when the construction job that Matt's Dad moved there for falls through. But Matt encourages his Dad to hold onto the farm, and try raising sheep on their pasture land (which is the best for miles around), with Lassie's help. A touching family movie, with convincing and crisp acting, emotion, and drama. Makes you laugh and cry. The slang has changed a lot since the 90's, however, giving this movie a slightly out-moded feel. Is it just me, or do teenagers really say ""cool"" anymore?

The plot was good, except the bad rancher along with his sons who stole the horses should have been showed to get some kind of punishment for their crime. The acting was better than average.
