660369,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00005K22Z,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[3, 3]","First of all, I want to note that although this video is currently being marketed as &quot;Pilates&quot; (it was originally called &quot;Body Reform&quot;), it is definitely NOT a Pilates workout--at most, there are some Pilates-inspired moves.  Secondly, although the video is called &quot;Total Body Training,&quot; despite some minimal abdominal and chest work, the workout mainly focuses on the lower body and specifically the inner thighs.  Finally, the resist-a-ring is definitely necessary to the workout; although it is not used for every exercise, when it is used, it is vital for make the movements more focused and TOUGH.All that being said, this is a challenging workout for the lower body.  It begins with a brief warmup to lengthen and stretch the muscles and then moves on to some beginning inner thigh moves combined with concentrated abs work.  Although the latter consists mainly of traditional crunches, the resist-a-ring is incorporated to make the moves more unique and more targeted.The next section comprises the heart of the workout and mainly targets the thighs.  The exercises are are done lying on the side and using the resist-a-ring to specifically focus on the inner thighs.  The moves are small but tough, with a high number of repetitions at an increasingly quickened pace.  Following the thigh work, it's onto the hands and knees (without the ring) for some tough buttocks moves, and then the entire thigh-buttocks sequence is repeated on the other side.  Then, just when you think you can't take any more, there are several sets of pushups plus some plank moves for the abs.  Finally, the workout ends with a brief stretching segment.At 50 minutes, this workout is a definite challenge to your strength and endurance.  Instructor Karen Voight is extremely encouraging, constantly reminding you that the workout is difficult but worth the results and saying things like &quot;hang in there with us for just two more.&quot;  Karen's form is impeccable, and she provides flawless cuing to match her excellent instruction.  I know that I will continue to challenge myself with this workout and that the results WILL be worth it.",5,One of the best thigh workouts you will ever find!,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,2158,"['First', 'want', 'note', 'video', 'currently', 'being', 'marketed', 'quot', 'Pilates', 'quot', 'was', 'originally', 'called', 'quot', 'Body', 'Reform', 'quot', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'Pilates', 'workout', 'most', 'are', 'Pilates-inspired', 'moves', 'Secondly', 'video', 'called', 'quot', 'Total', 'Body', 'Training', 'quot', 'minimal', 'abdominal', 'chest', 'work', 'workout', 'mainly', 'lower', 'body', 'specifically', 'inner', 'thighs', 'Finally', 'resist-a-ring', 'definitely', 'necessary', 'workout', 'not', 'used', 'exercise', 'when', 'used', 'vital', 'make', 'movements', 'more', 'focused', 'TOUGH.All', 'being', 'said', 'challenging', 'workout', 'lower', 'body', 'brief', 'warmup', 'lengthen', 'stretch', 'muscles', 'then', 'moves', 'beginning', 'inner', 'thigh', 'moves', 'combined', 'concentrated', 'abs', 'work', 'latter', 'mainly', 'traditional', 'crunches', 'resist-a-ring', 'incorporated', 'make', 'moves', 'more', 'unique', 'more', 'targeted.The', 'next', 'section', 'heart', 'workout', 'mainly', 'thighs', 'exercises', 'are', 'are', 'done', 'lying', 'side', 'using', 'resist-a-ring', 'specifically', 'focus', 'inner', 'thighs', 'moves', 'are', 'small', 'tough', 'high', 'number', 'repetitions', 'increasingly', 'quickened', 'pace', 'Following', 'thigh', 'work', 'hands', 'knees', 'ring', 'tough', 'buttocks', 'moves', 'then', 'entire', 'thigh-buttocks', 'sequence', 'repeated', 'other', 'side', 'Then', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'more', 'are', 'several', 'sets', 'pushups', 'plank', 'moves', 'abs', 'Finally', 'workout', 'brief', 'stretching', 'segment.At', '50', 'minutes', 'workout', 'definite', 'challenge', 'strength', 'endurance', 'Instructor', 'Karen', 'Voight', 'extremely', 'encouraging', 'constantly', 'reminding', 'workout', 'difficult', 'worth', 'results', 'saying', 'things', 'quot', 'hang', 'just', 'two', 'more.', 'quot', 'Karen', 'form', 'impeccable', 'flawless', 'cuing', 'match', 'excellent', 'instruction', 'know', 'will', 'continue', 'challenge', 'workout', 'results', 'WILL', 'be']",N/A

It struck me as I did this tape for the third time that while Voight is one of the most precise exercise instructors I've ever seen on video, she is not a great Pilates instructor.  I'm not sure whether that's a big deal or not- on the one hand, she does say on the back cover that this is for people who don't have time to do Pilates, yoga or ballet in their pure form.  On the other hand, she does call this &quot;Pilates- Total Body Training&quot;.If we take it as a workout that's &quot;Pilates-inspired&quot;, it's pretty good.  Her instructions are very precise, and it's easy to follow along (even if what she's asking you to do isn't easy).However, &quot;Total Body&quot; it's not.  24 pushups and one set of planks do not an upper body workout make, and while we do work the abs through some variations on crunches and the Pilates Corkscrew, I wouldn't use this as an abdominal workout.  The focus is clearly on the lower body.I'm in the minority, but I am not very concerned with my inner thighs.  Therefore, the fact that the majority of the exercises that were performed here focused on the inner thighs annoyed me after a while.  However, if this is your &quot;problem area&quot;, you'll love this tape.  I was hoping that the work for the buttocks would be just as intense.  Though she does include some targeted exercises for the glutes, it wasn't nearly as much as it was for the inner thighs.  The inner thighs are a tiny group of muscles compared to the buttocks; I would have thought a balanced workout would have been designed the other way around.Again, if the pet peeve of your body is your inner thighs, this will be a great tape for you.  Overall, it's a good tape, just not the same &quot;great&quot; I've come to expect from Voight.  If you want to balance the workout for your lower body, cross-train with the Lotte Berk Method Muscle Eats Fat and High Round Assets.",4,"More Pilates inspiration, but still not Pilates",1079481600,"03 17, 2004",2004,2023,"[""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'learn', 'how', 'perform', 'Pilates', 'mat', 'movements', 'not', 'tape', 'want', 'start', 'struck', 'did', 'tape', 'third', 'time', 'Voight', 'one', 'most', 'precise', 'exercise', 'instructors', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'video', 'not', 'great', 'Pilates', 'instructor', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'big', 'deal', 'not-', 'one', 'hand', 'say', 'back', 'cover', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'do', 'Pilates', 'yoga', 'ballet', 'pure', 'form', 'other', 'hand', 'call', 'quot', 'Pilates-', 'Total', 'Body', 'Training', 'quot', 'take', 'workout', 'quot', 'Pilates-inspired', 'quot', 'pretty', 'good', 'instructions', 'are', 'very', 'precise', 'easy', 'follow', 'along', 'even', 'what', 'asking', 'do', ""n't"", 'easy', '.However', 'quot', 'Total', 'Body', 'quot', 'not', '24', 'pushups', 'one', 'set', 'planks', 'do', 'not', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', 'make', 'do', 'work', 'abs', 'variations', 'crunches', 'Pilates', 'Corkscrew', 'would', ""n't"", 'use', 'abdominal', 'workout', 'focus', 'clearly', 'lower', 'body.I', ""'m"", 'minority', 'am', 'not', 'very', 'concerned', 'inner', 'thighs', 'Therefore', 'fact', 'majority', 'exercises', 'were', 'performed', 'here', 'focused', 'inner', 'thighs', 'annoyed', 'while', 'However', 'quot', 'problem', 'area', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'love', 'tape', 'was', 'hoping', 'work', 'buttocks', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'intense', 'include', 'targeted', 'exercises', 'glutes', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'inner', 'thighs', 'inner', 'thighs', 'are', 'tiny', 'group', 'muscles', 'compared', 'buttocks', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'balanced', 'workout', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'designed', 'other', 'way', 'around.Again', 'pet', 'peeve', 'body', 'inner', 'thighs', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'tape', 'Overall', 'good', 'tape', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'quot', 'great', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Voight', 'want', 'balance', 'workout', 'lower', 'body', 'cross-train', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'Method', 'Muscle', 'Eats', 'Fat', 'High', 'Round', 'Assets']",N/A

660373,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00005K22Z,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[22, 22]","Karen's calm voice has such a subtle way of enticing you into challenging exercises. The workout goddess herself will guide you through the workout while you are lying on your back, stomach or sitting. But don't think that because you are on the floor, this is going to be easy.Let me tell you, this is definitely intermediate and will give you a great lower-body workout. By the time you hit the pushups, I guarantee you will be panting. Yes, the transitions are easy and the workout doesn't have any fancy steps. In fact, the entire workout consists of smooth distinctive movements based on Pilates, Yoga, Ballet, and Karen's unique and fun body-sculpting techniques.First you wake up your muscles and head into a session of squeezing your thighs together with a ""Resist-a-Ring"" providing the resistance. You need a ""Resist-a-Ring"" (14"" spring-polymer circle with inside and outside padding) and a yoga mat to do this workout. Both can be ordered from Karen's site.There are 8 minutes of stretching, 36 minutes of seated and lying toning and another 6 minutes of stretching/cool down. During the 50 minutes, you will work on your upper body for 4 minutes. The lower body emphasis lasts for 26 minutes with a concentration on Abs for 6 minutes.The use of the ""Resist-a-Ring"" helps to inspire mental concentration, proper form and precise movements set to smooth, yet upbeat jazz music.While you will feel the burn, upon completion you will also feel a subtle energy flowing through your entire body.  Karen's workouts really do make you feel good and you can see the results.If you are looking for special attention to help slim and firm your butt and things, this will give you the leaner look you desire. While you are not using weights in this workout, Karen recommends combining this exercise video with your regular routine of weights and aerobic exercise.If you enjoy this video, you will love Core Essentials and Abdominals & Back, which are part of the Body Reform/Pilates Series. YogaSculpt and Streamline Fitness are also favorites.If you want to feel the burn, this is for you!
