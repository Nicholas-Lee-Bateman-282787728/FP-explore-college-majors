Sorkin writes shows about issues we should be thinking about and raises our intelligence level just by our watching even as we argue with some of his premises.  I am grateful to find something like this to watch given that tv is loaded with vampires, sleaze, trash and pure crap reality shows.  There is much about ""Newsroom"" that is well written, entertaining and addictive.  I watch with my laptop at hand so I can research some of the ""current affairs"" featured in the series. Yes I adored ""West Wing"" and am glad to get back to some snappy dialogue.  I think Jeff Daniels is perfect as the lead, Will McAvoy.  Daniels, always an underrated actor,  has all his skills on display here. In fact, most of the characters are people you will want to get to know.  There are areas that are flawed.  Jane Fonda is too plastic as the owner of the corporation. Surprisingly, the second lead, Emily Mortimer's character ""Mackenzie""is a Sorkin miscast from a guy who really knows how to put the right actors in the right roles.  First, while Daniels and Mortimer's characters supposedly have a long-burning passion for each other, there is no chemistry between them.Second, Mortimer plays the supposedly-brilliant, war-hardened producer as a doe-eyed, incompetent, whimpering mess.  Mortimer simply cannot fill the shoes of the character she is playing.I hope Sorkin will replace the MacKenzie character with someone more dynamic . Sorry Emily.Holly Hunter comes to mind.  She was terrific in ""Saving Grace"" as a tough, damaged, sexy, smart, fully-grown woman.  Also, she is close to Daniel's age (both in their mid-fifties), unlike the youngish Mortimer .  Oh yeah, she actually created this character in the 1980's in""Broadcast News"" and was nominated for an Academy Award.

It is obvious that the ""thrust"" of the show is to showcase a nexus between the giants of TV's early days with the current crop of journalists on ACN.The approach of this series is unique.  Michigan's own Jeff Daniels portrays a ""Rockstar"" T.V. anchor who has seen his popularity wane in a day of changing demographics.  ACN tackles real-world events such as the BP oil spill in the gulf and the 2012 Republican campaign.

Is there a way to find a balance?Many viewers might be shocked at how the show takes the gloves off to go after far Rightwing Tea Party whackjobs such as Rick Santorum, Michelle Bachmann & Sarah Palin.

890860,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B0007UQ264,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[1, 3]","It is hard to beat creator Aaron Sorkin's earlier smash series the ""West Wing."" He tries here under a new theme of creating a newsroom with real issues of the day. His trademark is a sharp, intellectual, fast-paced dialogue that sometimes requires you to pause and replay.  His theme addresses a major issue in politics that has critics from every political stripe--the media. One side complains of its liberal bias while the other complains of journalistic compromise and lethargy. This focuses on the latter, a charge made many times over, that the American media bends over backwards to be fair by presenting both sides of every issue no matter how ridiculous one side may be. This is a media that no longer informs the public and no longer delivers the truth. It delivers entertainment.TV Anchor Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels) realizes that he is a part of this compromise and has a catharsis, as part of a panel on stage, prodded by someone in the audience. As part of his being journalistically born again, he promises to start reporting the truth. Sorkin makes his conversion all the more real with actual stories from real news with the shooting of Kathy Giffords in Arizona and the oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. Some politicians such as Michele Bachmann and John McCain are positively skewered with their real, recorded appearances.What is more than a little farfetched is believing Will McAvoy is really a Republican. His hyperactive and sometimes shrill producer, MacKenzie (Mac) McHale is played by Emily Mortimer. Her sudden outbursts and impulsiveness can be unnerving. Sam Waterston plays Charlie Skinner, the news division president whose idealism sometimes borders on self-righteousness. The strong point is that we are treated to facts to important issues of the day. In other words, in Will McAvoy were are treated to media giants that we used to have in Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite, Howard K. Smith, Harry Reasoner, Huntley, Brinkley, and many others.When a TV series is this realistic there is a tendency to make comparisons and attempt to associate characters with those in real life. Comparing Sorkin's work to his previous creations would not be fair. Comparing his characters to real live ones is another matter. My significant other who was forced to become more politically conscious since being with me asked; ""Is [MacAvoy] supposed to be Keith Olbermann?"" The answer is yes and no. Sorkin haunted his studio and show when looking for background. He also watched Chris Matthews, with whom the real life Republican majority whip advised newly elected Republicans to avoid like the plague. Will McAvoy  asks questions like Matthews who probes his interviewees with the same death grip a lion has on its prey but lacks the dripping sarcasm and schadenfreude of Keith Olbermann who delighted in exposing the hypocrisy his opponents.""The Newsroom"" is not quite the ""West Wing,"" but it is still top drawer entertainment.

890870,A8RIVWC35B4RA,B0007UQ264,"G. Kukis ""Loserboy""","[2, 2]","First of all, I do like Aaron Sorkin (the writer and creator of &#34;The Newsroom&#34;, and believe that &#34;Sports Night&#34; and &#34;The West Wing&#34; were two of the best shows on television.  They were hits, and this is a miss.  This show is better than much of the crap that we find on television, but don't expect the same quality in &#34;The Newsroom&#34; that is found in the previous two shows.The characters are not compelling to me; and Jeff Daniels is very dishonest, politically speaking, which I will get to later.  I am less interested in the characters than I have been in Sorkin's earlier shows; and the clever dialogue just isn't as clever as Sorkin was once capable of producing.  If I stop watching this mid-series, I will not wonder, &#34;What happened with so-and-so?  Did he ever get with his girl friend?&#34;  In &#34;Sports Night&#34; I still wonder what happened to those characters.Since this is on HBO, expect to here a much more liberal use of the f-word and profanity.  Now, I know that there are people who swear, and swear a lot.  I don't know many of them personally, and I don't tend to spend any time with a person who speaks like this.  However, everyone on &#34;The Newsroom&#34; appears to speak like a sailor on leave (forgive the stereo-type).  I was a teacher at one time, so it became normal to speak without swearing.  Jeff Daniels is a newsman, so it would be normal for him to learn how to speak without swearing.  But, not this character.  I guess what I am saying is, the swearing doesn't really add anything to the program for me.  Perhaps for you, you won't even notice.So far, in the first 6 episodes, I have not seen any nudity.One of my problems is, this series is dishonest on the political level.  Jeff Daniels is sold as a card-carrying Republican, but one with moderate views.  No way that any normal person will buy this.  Whenever there is a chance to take a shot at the TEA party or at TEA party candidates, Aaron Sorkin does.  If you are a liberal, you will love this.  If you are a conservative, this will get irritating after awhile.A false history of the TEA party is presented.  When TEA party protests began all over the United States, news stations ignored them completely.  When the second set of demonstrations began, news organizations began to cover them, but mostly in a very negative light, calling them &#34;tea baggers&#34; and being hostile towards them.  Jeff Daniels, the newscaster, also views TEA party people in a negative light, but his approach is more refined and studied.  He explains in his newscasts and in his asides that the TEA party had a good beginning, but the Koch brothers sneaked in and corrupted the whole movement.  As if, it is impossible to imagine that the Koch brothers actually agreed with the basic principles of the TEA party; and that, by donating large sums of money to the TEA party, they somehow got into the brains of TEA party people and changed their minds about everything.  They were once pure with a few good ideas, but with that Koch money, they have become the most corrupt and unrealistic movement of our day (this is how it is presented in this series).For me, all of this was very dishonest.  I would have preferred for Jeff Daniels to be presented as a left-of-center liberal, which is essentially what he is (I have watched the first 6 episodes).  Then, I could better relate to his opinions, because they would be coming from a real place.It would be nice to see him take some substantive swipes against politicians of all stripes.  So far, he has labeled liberals as losers, but has never explained what that means.In &#34;The West Wing&#34;, Sorkin introduces a conservative who actually has some sensible things to say; and he later introduces a conservative  candidate with sensible things to say.  Even coming from the left, Sorkin presented these people reasonably and not as parodies.  Not so in the Newsroom.  This is every bit as slanted to the left as &#34;The West Wing&#34; with constant attacks against the TEA party; but with pretending that Daniels is a reasoned, sensible Republican, mostly.  I just don't buy that at all.If you are a liberal, you probably will view this series as truly fair and balanced.  If you are a conservative, you will find yourself grinding your teeth.  If you do not really care much about politics, this show is more interesting than the average television show (which is not saying much), but it could have been better.  So far, there have not been explosions, people running from the explosions and gun battles.  Nor has it been riddled with sex scenes (I am only about 6 eps in, so many this will change).  I see these things as what is good about this show.However, I feel like I am watching a television show created by a Sorkin-wannabe.  That sums up my thinking on this show.",3,3 stars for Aaron Sorkin; 4 stars in general,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,4852,"['First', 'do', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'writer', 'creator', '34', 'Newsroom', '34', 'believe', '34', 'Sports', 'Night', '34', '34', 'West', 'Wing', '34', 'were', 'two', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'were', 'hits', 'miss', 'show', 'better', 'much', 'crap', 'find', 'television', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'same', 'quality', '34', 'Newsroom', '34', 'found', 'previous', 'two', 'shows.The', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'compelling', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'very', 'dishonest', 'politically', 'speaking', 'will', 'get', 'later', 'am', 'less', 'interested', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'Sorkin', 'earlier', 'shows', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'clever', 'Sorkin', 'was', 'once', 'capable', 'producing', 'stop', 'watching', 'mid-series', 'will', 'not', 'wonder', '34', 'What', 'happened', 'so-and-so', 'Did', 'ever', 'get', 'girl', 'friend', '34', '34', 'Sports', 'Night', '34', 'still', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'characters.Since', 'HBO', 'expect', 'here', 'much', 'more', 'liberal', 'use', 'f-word', 'profanity', 'Now', 'know', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'swear', 'swear', 'lot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'many', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'tend', 'spend', 'time', 'person', 'who', 'However', 'everyone', '34', 'Newsroom', '34', 'speak', 'sailor', 'leave', 'forgive', 'stereo-type', 'was', 'teacher', 'one', 'time', 'became', 'normal', 'speak', 'swearing', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'newsman', 'would', 'be', 'normal', 'learn', 'how', 'speak', 'swearing', 'not', 'character', 'guess', 'what', 'am', 'saying', 'swearing', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'program', 'Perhaps', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice.So', 'far', 'first', '6', 'episodes', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'nudity.One', 'problems', 'series', 'dishonest', 'political', 'level', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'sold', 'card-carrying', 'Republican', 'one', 'moderate', 'views', 'way', 'normal', 'person', 'will', 'buy', 'Whenever', 'chance', 'take', 'shot', 'TEA', 'party', 'TEA', 'party', 'candidates', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'are', 'liberal', 'will', 'love', 'are', 'conservative', 'will', 'get', 'irritating', 'awhile.A', 'false', 'history', 'TEA', 'party', 'presented', 'When', 'TEA', 'party', 'protests', 'began', 'United', 'States', 'news', 'stations', 'ignored', 'completely', 'When', 'second', 'set', 'demonstrations', 'began', 'news', 'organizations', 'began', 'cover', 'mostly', 'very', 'negative', 'light', 'calling', '34', 'tea', 'baggers', '34', 'being', 'hostile', 'towards', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'newscaster', 'also', 'TEA', 'party', 'people', 'negative', 'light', 'approach', 'more', 'refined', 'studied', 'newscasts', 'asides', 'TEA', 'party', 'had', 'good', 'beginning', 'Koch', 'brothers', 'sneaked', 'corrupted', 'whole', 'movement', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'Koch', 'brothers', 'actually', 'agreed', 'basic', 'principles', 'TEA', 'party', 'donating', 'large', 'sums', 'money', 'TEA', 'party', 'somehow', 'got', 'brains', 'TEA', 'party', 'people', 'changed', 'minds', 'everything', 'were', 'once', 'pure', 'few', 'good', 'ideas', 'Koch', 'money', 'have', 'become', 'most', 'corrupt', 'unrealistic', 'movement', 'day', 'how', 'presented', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'dishonest', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'be', 'presented', 'left-of-center', 'liberal', 'essentially', 'what', 'have', 'watched', 'first', '6', 'episodes', 'Then', 'could', 'better', 'relate', 'opinions', 'would', 'be', 'coming', 'real', 'place.It', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'take', 'substantive', 'swipes', 'politicians', 'stripes', 'So', 'far', 'labeled', 'liberals', 'losers', 'never', 'explained', 'what', 'means.In', '34', 'West', 'Wing', '34', 'Sorkin', 'conservative', 'who', 'actually', 'sensible', 'things', 'say', 'later', 'conservative', 'candidate', 'sensible', 'things', 'say', 'Even', 'coming', 'left', 'Sorkin', 'presented', 'people', 'reasonably', 'not', 'parodies', 'Not', 'so', 'Newsroom', 'bit', 'slanted', 'left', '34', 'West', 'Wing', '34', 'constant', 'attacks', 'TEA', 'party', 'pretending', 'Daniels', 'reasoned', 'sensible', 'Republican', 'mostly', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'all.If', 'are', 'liberal', 'probably', 'will', 'view', 'series', 'truly', 'fair', 'balanced', 'are', 'conservative', 'will', 'find', 'grinding', 'teeth', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'care', 'much', 'politics', 'show', 'more', 'interesting', 'average', 'television', 'show', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'So', 'far', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'explosions', 'people', 'running', 'explosions', 'gun', 'battles', 'been', 'riddled', 'sex', 'scenes', 'am', 'only', 'about', '6', 'eps', 'so', 'many', 'will', 'change', 'see', 'things', 'what', 'good', 'show.However', 'feel', 'am', 'watching', 'television', 'show', 'created', 'Sorkin-wannabe', 'sums', 'up', 'thinking', 'show']",The Newsroom - The Complete First Season
890871,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007UQ264,Grady Harp,"[189, 205]","Brilliant, Briskly Intelligent Writing was the title for this review when this enormously successful series premiered in June 2012. For some reason Amazon did not make this available either on Video On Demand or in a place where reviews could be written. Now the first season is complete - having finished last night with one of the finest shows of the season. And with the soon to be released DVD set of the first year, we can finally discuss it. To start with, the following response was to the first opening show:A new series launched on HBO with a star-spangled episode `We just decided to'. As conceived and written by Aaron Sorkin it is a timely, incredibly intelligently written show populated with some of our best seasoned actors as well as some very fine actors on the way up. This is the kind of television that reminds us that at one time the news programs informed us about current events and ran a continuing commentary on the development of events in this country and around the world in a manner that kept us alerted of why we as a nation needed to remain alert to both good and bad events, to celebrate when indicated and to fight back when injustices were occurring. This direction is indicated in the background imagery for the titles - running glimpses of the likes of Walter Cronkite, Edward R Murrow, Huntley/Brinkley etc who were responsible news anchors instead of the flippant celebrities more concerned with ratings of their show than the news we see today.The first episode opens with popular news anchor Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels who proves his acting chops here) being interviewed on a college campus and responds to a student question `Why is America the greatest country' by answering `We're not. We used to be' and then runs us past our history of reportage on television that proves that the country has fallen in world view because we no longer care about our initial basic rights and freedoms and concern for humanity. It is a powerful start with some of the most gut-wrenching insightful history of this country that has been written for televisionFrom there, McAvoy returns to his station to find a support team missing and a replacement named. But enter an old flame, the war correspondent fatigued Mackenzie MacHale (Emily Mortimer, never more brilliant) who has been assigned Will's new Executive Producer, and in the midst of many changes the new arrangement (not a popular one for Will) evolves into a return to actual news reporting of the significant type - all over the 2010 BP oil explosion and spill that threatened the Gulf of Mexico. It is raw, real, factual, and immediate news delivered with veracity and commitment.From this initial episode the series takes on the most significant events that have affected this country in the last 2 years - the major Wall Street disaster, the activity of the Tea Party sector of the Republican Party, the political party with which Will is aligned but in the final episode, after recuperating for a severe bout of depression, he returns to his place at the news desk in the final episode `In Name Only' and ends the season with a diatribe about the current status of his party berating them as a party for their ideological purity, compromise as weakness, a fundamentalist belief in scriptural literalism, denying science, unmoved by facts, undeterred by new information, hostile fear of progress , a demonization of education, a need to control women's bodies, severe xenophobia, tribal mentality, intolerance of dissent, and pathological hatred of the US government. 'They can call themselves the Tea Party, they can call themselves conservatives, and they can even call themselves Republicans, though Republicans probably shouldn't. But we should call them what they are, the American Taliban.'Greg Mottola and others direct with keen precision, allowing moments of comic relief to be present if subtle and keeps the momentum of the show propelling smoothly. The cast of superb actors includes John Gallagher, Jr. (brilliant), Dev Patel, Allison Pill, Sam Waterston (never better), Thomas Sadoski, Chris Chalk, Trieu Tran, Charlie Weirauch, Margaret Judson, Olivia Munn, Adina Porter, Hope Lange, Jane Fonda - and more. A more talented and committed cast would be hard to imagine. THIS is the kind of television series we so very sorely need right now.

As the show rolls along you see that fire light and he gets a good head of steam. He's not perfect and can stumble badly, but you know his head is going in the right direction as he becomes the journalist she knows he can be and the boss he thought he was.It is a very talky show. There is a lot of dialogue and the personal stories can get very mawkish on occasion, but when a news story comes in you see the team come together and flow into what we all hope real news teams have going. This is helped by the fact the stories they cover are real. Not recognizable as nicely masked real events but real things that happened in the world it becomes so much more approachable and the ethical questions real-such as the shooting of Gabbie Giffords as other networks are rushing to report her death They argue the angles-is there confirmation? are we going to be the last to report the 'news' or are the other teams getting it wrong and we have a responsibility to get it right-all in a commercial break!I've gotten bored with so much scripted tv and the less said about `reality' the better.

Emily Mortimer is sheer enchantment - somehow making a seemingly bizarre patchwork character completely believable.  And Sorkin's idealistic, quixotic take on media and politics strangely brings to mind the best of Frank Capra.

890892,AYNAA33DXK6L8,B0007UQ264,Jonathan Kissel,"[41, 105]","I am not familiar with the television work of Aaron Sorkin, but based on his film work, specifically The Social Network, I was eagerly anticipating his latest show, The Newsroom.  Combined with HBO's track record, it seemed like it would be a surefire success.  Sadly, however, something is seriously wrong on the set of News Night, the show within a show at the heart of The Newsroom.The flaws endemic to The Newsroom are many.  First, it takes place in April 2010, when a disillusioned news anchor (Jeff Daniels) reunites with his old girlfriend/executive producer (Emily Mortimer) to reimagine the anchor's news show as a forum to `speak truth to stupid' and revive the glorious journalistic traditions of Cronkite and Murrow in an age poisoned by false equivalency and the quest for ratings.  Sounds promising enough, but the recent history gimmick allows Sorkin to erect straw man after straw man, and then burn them down in flourishes of blatant obviousness.  Need to portray a character as brilliant?  Have them accurately predict the 2011 debt ceiling debacle.  Want to paint an executive as callow and unfeeling?  Have him demand that Gaby Giffords be declared dead before official confirmation.  Sorkin also has either no interest, or no conception, of how journalism is actually practiced.  In the pilot, a character breaks months worth of news on the BP oil spill because he happens to know someone willing to talk at both BP and Halliburton on the first night of the disaster.  This pattern of an employee knowing a principal in a news story is repeated over and over again, until it destroys any and all credibility the show has.  I've learned a lot about New Orleans from watching HBO's Treme.  After a season of The Newsroom, I think I actually know less about journalism and how it's practiced.The structural flaws of The Newsroom would be tolerable if the characters were written with anything resembling likeability or consistency.  The worst offender is Mortimer's character, who is described as a hardened newswoman with extensive experience in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, but the audience is never shown that person.  Instead, we get a woman who can't send an e-mail on her phone, freely admits to having no understanding of all things economic, and regularly gets into screaming matches over her frazzled romantic life, in front of her employees.  That must have gone over well with the troops.  The endless romantic entanglements ensnare every major character, culminating in a five-sided love pentagon by the end of the season.  Combined with Sorkin's vaudevillian sense of humor, mainly involving childish pratfalls, the entire show makes the viewer smack their forehead in disbelief at the sheer ridiculousness of it all.For all its problems, I will be back for this show's second season.  The actors are doing the best they can, especially Sam Waterston as a network executive, the show is directed with a sense of forward momentum (although sometimes too much, like in the early episode that takes place over six months of show time), and Sorkin is undeniably good at writing dialogue.  I agree with every point The Newsroom makes about the state of journalism and politics, but in a world that already has The Daily Show for media criticism, it is not enough to preach to the choir.  Every aspect of The Newsroom as it currently stands is flawed, but ultimately fixable.  Hopefully, Sorkin can learn from Will McAvoy and change what he's doing.",2,A shocking misstep from a talented creator.,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,3479,"['am', 'not', 'familiar', 'television', 'work', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'based', 'film', 'work', 'specifically', 'Social', 'Network', 'was', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'latest', 'show', 'Newsroom', 'Combined', 'HBO', 'track', 'record', 'seemed', 'would', 'be', 'surefire', 'success', 'Sadly', 'however', 'something', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'set', 'News', 'Night', 'show', 'show', 'heart', 'Newsroom.The', 'flaws', 'endemic', 'Newsroom', 'are', 'many', 'First', 'place', 'April', '2010', 'when', 'disillusioned', 'news', 'anchor', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'old', 'girlfriend/executive', 'producer', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'reimagine', 'anchor', 'news', 'show', 'forum', 'speak', 'truth', 'stupid', 'revive', 'glorious', 'journalistic', 'traditions', 'Cronkite', 'Murrow', 'age', 'poisoned', 'false', 'equivalency', 'quest', 'ratings', 'promising', 'enough', 'recent', 'history', 'gimmick', 'Sorkin', 'erect', 'straw', 'man', 'straw', 'man', 'then', 'burn', 'down', 'flourishes', 'blatant', 'obviousness', 'Need', 'portray', 'character', 'brilliant', 'Have', 'accurately', 'predict', '2011', 'debt', 'ceiling', 'debacle', 'Want', 'paint', 'executive', 'callow', 'unfeeling', 'Have', 'demand', 'Gaby', 'Giffords', 'be', 'declared', 'dead', 'official', 'confirmation', 'Sorkin', 'also', 'interest', 'conception', 'how', 'journalism', 'actually', 'practiced', 'pilot', 'character', 'breaks', 'months', 'news', 'BP', 'oil', 'spill', 'know', 'someone', 'willing', 'talk', 'BP', 'Halliburton', 'first', 'night', 'disaster', 'pattern', 'employee', 'knowing', 'principal', 'news', 'story', 'repeated', 'over', 'again', 'credibility', 'show', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'lot', 'New', 'Orleans', 'watching', 'HBO', 'Treme', 'season', 'Newsroom', 'think', 'actually', 'know', 'less', 'journalism', 'how', 'practiced.The', 'structural', 'flaws', 'Newsroom', 'would', 'be', 'tolerable', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'anything', 'resembling', 'likeability', 'consistency', 'worst', 'offender', 'Mortimer', 'character', 'who', 'described', 'hardened', 'newswoman', 'extensive', 'experience', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'audience', 'never', 'shown', 'person', 'Instead', 'get', 'woman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'send', 'e-mail', 'phone', 'freely', 'having', 'understanding', 'things', 'economic', 'regularly', 'screaming', 'matches', 'frazzled', 'romantic', 'life', 'front', 'employees', 'must', 'have', 'gone', 'over', 'well', 'troops', 'endless', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'ensnare', 'major', 'character', 'culminating', 'five-sided', 'love', 'pentagon', 'end', 'season', 'Combined', 'Sorkin', 'vaudevillian', 'sense', 'humor', 'mainly', 'involving', 'childish', 'pratfalls', 'entire', 'show', 'viewer', 'smack', 'forehead', 'disbelief', 'sheer', 'ridiculousness', 'problems', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'show', 'second', 'season', 'actors', 'are', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'especially', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'network', 'executive', 'show', 'directed', 'sense', 'forward', 'momentum', 'sometimes', 'too', 'much', 'early', 'episode', 'place', 'six', 'months', 'show', 'time', 'Sorkin', 'undeniably', 'good', 'writing', 'dialogue', 'agree', 'point', 'Newsroom', 'state', 'journalism', 'politics', 'world', 'already', 'Daily', 'Show', 'media', 'criticism', 'not', 'enough', 'preach', 'choir', 'aspect', 'Newsroom', 'currently', 'flawed', 'ultimately', 'fixable', 'Hopefully', 'Sorkin', 'can', 'learn', 'Will', 'McAvoy', 'change', 'what', 'doing']",The Newsroom - The Complete First Season

They see the absurdity surrounding them and comment on it, sometimes with wit, sometimes a blush.But they are, each and every one, people you want to hang around with. You want to laugh with them. You want to suffer with them when they realize they've goofed up somehow. You root for them, you get angry at them, your heart breaks for them.I want to argue with Jim. I want to hug Maggie and tell her it will be all right. I want to watch Mac and Don go at it with laser tight wit. I want to get stoned with Will and just let him talk. I want Sloan. (that's all.

I have no opinion per say on the ""Tea Party"", though in the past I have deducted when a form of media takes a ""soapbox"" position, as opposed to telling a story.  I have not done so here for several reasons:1.) I honestly don't know what the Writer's politics are.  While it may be a gross generalization, as a rule Hollywood Writers are portrayed as being Liberals2.) I found the topic to be both interesting and provide knowledge in a manner that an educated, though non-politico such as myself could understand (I.E.

He is taken off guard when his producer moves to a new show and takes his staff with him.Emily Mortimer, plays MacKenzie, an old love and now his new executive producer. Mortimer is the one thing wrong with this show.

Alison Pill, plays  Margaret &#34;Maggie&#34; Jordan: an eager associate producer of News Night. She has complicated personal relationships with Don and Jim that spill over into her work life.Alison is a true spirit and great actress. Dev Patel plays Neelamani &#34;Neal&#34; Sampat, the writer of Will's blog and news scanner of the Internet. He becomes an ncreasingly mportant member of the team. Olivia Munn plays, Sloan Sabbith. She is an economist with a show on the network, and is easily the best of the group.

Helps that I share his political orientation, but I also appreciate how he challenges your intelligence, awareness of public issues, and attention span -- not that your attention wanders, but simply that it is hard work to keep up with Sorkin's pacing.  This series, as with West Wing, Sports Night, and Studio 60, features a fine ensemble cast, sparkling dialog both witty and passionate, and the making of points that need to be made in the public space.  I've always liked Jeff Daniels, and was happy to see him get a strong leading role at last.  Among the rest of the cast, Olivia Munn stands out & has created a memorable character as an economic scholar turned reporter who just happens to speak Japanese (as she does in real life).  Sam Waterston does his usual outstanding job as the network president, forever putting out fires started by the charismatic anchor and his colleagues.  The only weak link is Emily Mortimer as the Newsroom senior producer and past/probable future love interest for Jeff Daniels' character.  She doesn't quite come across as a strong enough personality, & pales in comparison with the two great female leads in West Wing, Allison Janney and Stockard Channing.  But she's carried by a very strong ensemble and occasionally rises to the occasion.

The acting and the dialogue is riveting. My only gripe so far is with the Pilot episode in which Will McAvoy is pressured to answer a deceptively complex question, Why is America the Greatest country? There stem two major problems: whereby a news reporter is pressured repeatedly to answer a question that has no real factual or objective value, is this something that would really play out in reality? I have my doubts. Secondly, the answer suggested by Mac is ok, 'America isnt the greatest country but it can be ' plays on an entrepreneurial and aspirational  spirit that is integral to American culture, but the actual answer provided by McAvoy deviTes too far from this in which he compares our country to others highlighting where we fall short. Why is it necessary to denigrate our country in order to appreciate the achievements and rich ultures of others? That kind of dialogue is simplistic and pessimistic at best, demeaning at worst, and it turns my stomach. The great thing however, is that the show provides a forum or discourse on politics and American vLues Nd stimulates my mind, and gives me reason to reflect on where my values and take on the issues truly lie.
