While it's a joyous occasion to see the band onstage again, it's sad knowing this would be one of the last times the group would be performing onstage in the UK.There's an extremely high level of emotion on this dvd, as well as some tension. Mike Love takes over most of the show, making the rest of the group seem like a backing band. Dennis Wilson is good here but his use of drugs becomes increasingly evident with each performance. Al and Carl give the best performances. Al dlievers strong renditions of &quot;Cottonfields&quot;, &quot;Heroes And Villains&quot; and &quot;Help Me Rhonda, and Carl's heavenly voice shines above the rest on &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. Bruce Johnston remains hidden for the most of the show, but this would change later in the tour when he got his own solo spot. Brian Wilson, overweight to the nines at this point, sits perched behind a piano for most of the show, contributing a few lines on &quot;Sloop John B&quot; and &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;. The main complaint I have is the sound. The band's backing vocals on &quot;God Only Knows&quot; seem to be buried in the mix.

The boys from Hawthorne sound alive and well here (with the exception of Brian and Dennis Wilson, though they can be forgiven since they were battling personal demons at this point), and the overall song selection will not let you down.&quot;Good Timin' (Live At Knebworth England, 1980)&quot; is from the band's last appearance in the U. K. with the original lineup, though they obviously did know it at time. The band does plauy with a fiery edge as though it was the last time they're performing them. They sound youthful and ibrant on the rockers especially &quot;Help Me Rhonda&quot;, &quot;I Get Around&quot;, &quot;Surfin' USA&quot;, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; and &quot;Fun Fun Fun&quot;. The slow songs are a mixed bag. The best is Carl Wilson's beautiful rendition of &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. Al Jardine also turns in a great reading of &quot;Lady Lynda&quot;, but Brian sounds whiny on &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; and Dennis' once sparkling voice is unheard on &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot;.Despite its flaws, this is a really great dvd. It also comes with a nice Al Jardine introduction and song commentary. Here's hoping that the four remaining Beach Boys (Al Jardine, Mike Love, Bruce Johnston and Brian Wilson) get back together soon, since the world needs them in this time of horrible music, courtesy of Britney, Christina and Eminem",5,A Highly Worthwhile Live DVD,1088812800,"07 3, 2004",2004,1438,"['big', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'fan', 'found', 'dvd', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'boys', 'Hawthorne', 'sound', 'alive', 'well', 'here', 'exception', 'Brian', 'Dennis', 'Wilson', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'were', 'battling', 'personal', 'demons', 'point', 'overall', 'song', 'selection', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'down.', 'quot', 'Good', 'Timin', 'Live', 'Knebworth', 'England', '1980', 'quot', 'band', 'last', 'appearance', 'U.', 'K.', 'original', 'lineup', 'obviously', 'did', 'know', 'time', 'band', 'plauy', 'fiery', 'edge', 'was', 'last', 'time', ""'re"", 'performing', 'sound', 'youthful', 'ibrant', 'rockers', 'especially', 'quot', 'Help', 'Me', 'Rhonda', 'quot', 'quot', 'Get', 'quot', 'quot', 'Surfin', 'USA', 'quot', 'quot', 'Good', 'Vibrations', 'quot', 'quot', 'Barbara', 'Ann', 'quot', 'quot', 'Fun', 'Fun', 'Fun', 'quot', 'slow', 'songs', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'best', 'Carl', 'Wilson', 'beautiful', 'rendition', 'quot', 'God', 'Only', 'Knows', 'quot', 'Al', 'Jardine', 'also', 'great', 'reading', 'quot', 'Lady', 'Lynda', 'quot', 'Brian', 'whiny', 'quot', 'Surfer', 'Girl', 'quot', 'Dennis', 'once', 'sparkling', 'voice', 'unheard', 'quot', 'Are', 'So', 'Beautiful', 'quot', 'flaws', 'really', 'great', 'dvd', 'also', 'nice', 'Al', 'Jardine', 'introduction', 'song', 'commentary', 'Here', 'hoping', 'four', 'remaining', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Al', 'Jardine', 'Mike', 'Love', 'Bruce', 'Johnston', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'soon', 'world', 'time', 'horrible', 'music', 'courtesy', 'Britney', 'Christina', 'Eminem']","Beach Boys: Good Timin - Live at Knebworth, England 1980"

This is one of the best concert dvds that I've seen. This concert features all 5 original members ( plus late bloomer Bruce Johnston ) performing onstage together for the last time in the U. K.The boys were in fine form that memorable evening. The song selection is a mostly a hits - heavy set of oldies including &quot;California Girls&quot;, &quot;I Get Around&quot;, &quot;Be True To Your School&quot;, &quot;Fun Fun Fun&quot;, and particularly hot versions of &quot;Help Me Rhonda&quot; and &quot;Barbara Ann&quot;. They also perform a few satisfying but not as well - received newer numbers, including the pretty &quot;Lady Lynda&quot; and a smokin' &quot;Keepin' The Summer Alive&quot;. The band members themselves are top notch musically. Brian Wilson remains secluded behind the piano for the whole show, but contributes some lead vocal work on &quot;Sloop John B&quot;, as well as on the heartbreaking performance of &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;. The late Carl Wilson is just amazing on &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, and Dennis Wilson's drumming is among his best. Unfortuneately, years of drug, cigarette and alcohol abuse seem to have caught up with him. But his voice still sounds beautiful on his lone solo number, a cover of Joe Cocker's &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot;.This is a perfect show. Sad and joyful all at once. All the songs you enjoy plus some other, less familliar numbers. However, I did notice some lyrical differences between this dvd and the cd, particularly on &quot;Lady Lynda&quot;. On the cd, the a capella part is performed as, &quot;Won't You Lye Lady, Sing Your Song Of Love&quot;, while on the dvd it's &quot;Won't Lye Lady, Won't You Marry Me&quot;.

742784,A1622K3BLYEKB5,B00008HCB8,"Avalon Don ""Avalon Don""","[5, 5]","(DVD) -  The Knebworth Show is a reminder of what a great band The Beach Boys were.  First, the classic line-up is intact bringing their energy level to a live concert that will never happen again.  Second, Dennis Wilson pounding hard on the drums drives the boys thru the surf favorites like they're new.  Third, Mike Love not over performing, sings in a most professional manner.  Fourth, the set list is perfect balencing their biggest songs with forgotten gems like ""Lady Lynda"".  Fourth, even though Brian Wilson is more of a token at this concert, it's great to see him back on stage with his band.  Fifth, finally a 70 minute action packed concert from start to finish with no interruptions.  (More Beach Boys live 1970's shows on DVD, please!)  In recent years too much has been written and discussed about regarding this group instead of focusing on what these guys created.  The documentaries - i.e.  ""Endless Harmony"", ""An American Band"", and ""The Lost Concert"" are more for historical value.  This one is different.  At Knebworth The Beach Boys are mature, could still harmonize and were a group that mattered.  I followed the band as a kid since ""Surfin' Safari"".  On this night, they matter.  This is The Beach Boys as far as I'm concerned in DVD/Video format for repeated watching.  (CD) - This release is comparable to the 1973 double concert album.  The latter had an earthy feel featuring Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar.  Knebworth is more souped up as in Rock & Roll.  Listen to the revamped ""Help Rhonda"" which goes into early jam overdrive.  This is where the beach, cars, girls and crowd hit a groove that can only be found at a Beach Boys concert.  A magical moment which some of you will understand if you ever attended one of their big shows during the ""Endless Summer"" era.  From that point on this concert simply takes off.  So what if they really did vocal studio overdubs after the fact?  The Allman Brothers, The Stones and The Who did some touch up work on their great live albums.  So did Peter Frampton.  It's the finished product that counts.  Knebworth is a feel good CD, perfect for one those dreary kind on days.",5,THANK YOU DVD!,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,2151,"['DVD', 'Knebworth', 'Show', 'reminder', 'what', 'great', 'band', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'were', 'First', 'classic', 'line-up', 'intact', 'bringing', 'energy', 'level', 'live', 'concert', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'again', 'Second', 'Dennis', 'Wilson', 'pounding', 'hard', 'drums', 'boys', 'thru', 'surf', ""'re"", 'new', 'Third', 'Mike', 'Love', 'not', 'performing', 'sings', 'most', 'professional', 'manner', 'Fourth', 'set', 'list', 'perfect', 'balencing', 'biggest', 'songs', 'forgotten', 'gems', 'Lady', 'Lynda', 'Fourth', 'even', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'more', 'token', 'concert', 'great', 'see', 'back', 'stage', 'band', 'Fifth', 'finally', '70', 'minute', 'action', 'packed', 'concert', 'start', 'finish', 'interruptions', 'More', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'live', '1970', 'shows', 'DVD', 'please', 'recent', 'years', 'too', 'much', 'been', 'written', 'discussed', 'regarding', 'group', 'instead', 'focusing', 'what', 'guys', 'created', 'documentaries', 'i.e', 'Endless', 'Harmony', 'American', 'Band', 'Lost', 'Concert', 'are', 'more', 'historical', 'value', 'one', 'different', 'Knebworth', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'are', 'mature', 'could', 'still', 'harmonize', 'were', 'group', 'mattered', 'followed', 'band', 'kid', 'Surfin', 'Safari', 'night', 'matter', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'DVD/Video', 'format', 'repeated', 'watching', 'CD', 'release', 'comparable', '1973', 'double', 'concert', 'album', 'latter', 'had', 'earthy', 'feel', 'featuring', 'Blondie', 'Chaplin', 'Ricky', 'Fataar', 'Knebworth', 'more', 'souped', 'up', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Listen', 'revamped', 'Help', 'Rhonda', 'early', 'jam', 'overdrive', 'where', 'beach', 'cars', 'girls', 'crowd', 'hit', 'groove', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'concert', 'magical', 'moment', 'will', 'understand', 'ever', 'attended', 'one', 'big', 'shows', 'Endless', 'Summer', 'era', 'point', 'concert', 'simply', 'off', 'So', 'what', 'really', 'did', 'vocal', 'studio', 'overdubs', 'fact', 'Allman', 'Brothers', 'Stones', 'Who', 'did', 'touch', 'up', 'work', 'great', 'live', 'albums', 'So', 'did', 'Peter', 'Frampton', 'finished', 'product', 'Knebworth', 'feel', 'good', 'CD', 'perfect', 'one', 'dreary', 'kind', 'days']","Beach Boys: Good Timin - Live at Knebworth, England 1980"

However, it is the last DVD made that had all of the original Beach Boys in it and as such is worth having.  If you watch closely, you can see the dynamics of the group and the fissure fault lines that later developed.  Al Jardine had only 1 or 2 songs that were his, yet Mike Love(who I loved also) would inevitably take them over or dominate the performace, being the ""lead singer"" for the group.  Seeing the musical genius that was Brian Wilson was nice, as it was seeing the other guys.  The performance was actually a cold bleak night in Great Britain and not a breezy Hollywood night as one would expect.

Ewing,"[2, 2]","There is probably no good reason for me to chime in here other than to correct a previous reviewer:  Al Jardine doesn't ask Brian Wilson if he's okay, he asks if he is in A - as in the key of A, at the beginning of a song.  Well, that's my interpretation anyway.  I'll agree Brian really doesn't seem to recognize there is even an audience, and one can see the ""Don't Panic"" signs hung in the dim background light, but Brian is pounding away at the piano and sings his parts with conviction.In spite of the cold and wet weather, the Beach Boys warm the audience with songs of California Girls, the sun, surfing.  It's interesting to see the interaction between the band members.  I was surprised to see Dennis' compelling drumming since he looks to be in a washed-out state.  At one point he comes up front to sing harmonies alongside Mike Love.  Dennis points to his ear as if to say he can't hear, he moves up next to Mike, who rolls his eyes and rather than put his arm around him, gives him the cold shoulder.  Dennis doesn't seem bothered, and just continues doing his homeless-guy act. On another viewing, it may just be Dennis coyly playing the Surfer Girl, about whom they are singing.  But at the end of the song, very briefly you see Carl going at Mike about something, with Dennis being the peacemaker. There are many of these nuances that you might miss on first viewing, it's a good reason to watch it a few times with your remote control close at hand. Al Jardine, Carl Wilson, and Bruce Johnston seem to be the glue holding the show together, and in spite of the cold weather and family hostilities, all made the effort to come to England for this show. I rate it 5 stars not because it's the most wonderful performance I've ever seen, but because it's reasonably good and captures an important American band at a good time.

Although my ultimate fantasy would be an entire concert from the great 1970-71 tour when the boys were traveling with a small horn section and were performing hunks of their repertoire from &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; to &quot;Sunflower&quot;, this concert will more than hold me over until that dream is realized one day, hopefully. Having seen The Beach Boys more times than I can count, I had forgotten what a hard working band they were until I saw &quot;Live at Knebworth&quot;. Their ability to perform &quot;Live&quot; and with fidelity the gorgeous complex songs that were the soundtrack of our lives growing up in the 60's and 70's is a joy to behold on this DVD. It was the last time all 6 original members of the band (including an obviously nervous Brian) performed together on stage and you can tell the boys are working hard this night to give their British audience a memorable concert. Some of the highlights for me were their performances of Al Jardine's &quot;Lady Lynda&quot; from the L.A. Light album and a faithfully rendered version of Brian's groundbreaking &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (in spite of grandstanding from the allways creepy Mike Love). It's also apparent in this concert that Dennis is already starting on a downward slide that would ultimately  end in his untimely death in 1982. His ragged solo performance of &quot;You are so Beautiful&quot; is a poignant reminder that the end is not far off. Carl Wilson, one of the greatest vocalists in rock history, proves throughout this concert that he was the linchpin that held this band together until his tragic death in 1998 ended once and for all the band as a viable performing entity.

742788,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B00008HCB8,Giordano Bruno,"[2, 2]","... that tells all the inside scooby about The Beach Boys -- about their maniacal abusive father, about the squabbles between the Wilson brothers and cousin, about drugs and diagnosable mental states, about their tragedies as human beings that were so beatifically excluded from their music. I haven't read such a book, but the other reviews here on amazoon tell a lot. I skimmed over the wikipedia article on their history and felt saddened enough, not just because they've had beastly lives -- many artists have had beastly lives -- but because they've brought me so much joyous energy over decades and I can't pay any of it back to them.Much of the dynamics of their stress can be observed during this concert in foul weather in England in 1980. By that time, the group and most of the members were in shaky shape, particularly the core composer/performer Brian Wilson, who sits slumped at his piano, a dismal detached hulk. The program of songs include some that didn't suit the group's style very aptly, and some that were obviously waaaay under-rehearsed.

742789,A11P7PDFFZFVWO,B00008HCB8,"HUGH H. KIRKPATRICK ""Chuck Kirkpatrick""","[21, 22]","First off, nobody loves the Beach Boys more than I do.  I grew up with thier music.  As a musician, I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Brian Wilson for what he taught me about harmony.  I've seen dozens of their shows, some awful, some incredible.  And in 1983, a famous band I was in was their opening act for 3 weeks, so I got to hang with them and hear them every night.  Live performances are generally never quite up to par with studio performances, and as a performing musician, producer, and engineer, I understand that.  It's nearly impossible to achieve on stage amongst the roar of amplifiers and monitors what can be done in the studio where there is a totally controlled environment - and the ability to repair any mistakes.  ""Good Timin'"" is indeed a live performance, but it has been enhanced or 'sweetened' back in the recording studio before being released.  The backround harmonies have been supplemented by overdubs, if not all replaced completely.  A trained ear will hear the double-tracking of parts - commonplace in any studio recording.  It just makes everything sound ""fatter"".  This is nothing new.  The Eagles have done this on all their live recordings, as have Fleetwood Mac and plenty of other vocal groups.  Some groups, like the Bee Gees, will even run pre-recorded tracks at their live shows to recreate the lush wall of voices that characterize their studio recordings.  Personally, I like hearing the rough edges and rawness of a true live recording.  The Beach Boys made the best harmony records of anybody, so we know they can sing.  I don't mind hearing a missed part or flat note here & there.  I wish they'd just mixed ""Good Timin'"" the way it was.  The real beauty here is seeing The Boys all playing together for the very last time.",4,With a Little Help From The Studio,1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,1772,"['First', 'off', 'nobody', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'more', 'do', 'grew', 'up', 'thier', 'music', 'musician', 'owe', 'huge', 'debt', 'gratitude', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'what', 'taught', 'harmony', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozens', 'shows', 'awful', 'incredible', '1983', 'famous', 'band', 'was', 'was', 'opening', 'act', '3', 'weeks', 'got', 'hang', 'hear', 'night', 'Live', 'performances', 'are', 'generally', 'never', 'quite', 'par', 'studio', 'performances', 'performing', 'musician', 'producer', 'engineer', 'understand', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'achieve', 'stage', 'roar', 'amplifiers', 'monitors', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'studio', 'where', 'totally', 'controlled', 'environment', 'ability', 'repair', 'mistakes', 'Good', 'Timin', 'indeed', 'live', 'performance', 'been', 'enhanced', ""'sweetened"", 'back', 'recording', 'studio', 'being', 'released', 'backround', 'harmonies', 'have', 'been', 'supplemented', 'overdubs', 'not', 'replaced', 'completely', 'trained', 'ear', 'will', 'hear', 'double-tracking', 'parts', 'commonplace', 'studio', 'recording', 'just', 'everything', 'sound', 'fatter', 'nothing', 'new', 'Eagles', 'have', 'done', 'live', 'recordings', 'have', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'plenty', 'other', 'vocal', 'groups', 'groups', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'will', 'even', 'run', 'pre-recorded', 'tracks', 'live', 'shows', 'recreate', 'lush', 'wall', 'voices', 'characterize', 'studio', 'recordings', 'Personally', 'like', 'hearing', 'rough', 'edges', 'rawness', 'true', 'live', 'recording', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'made', 'best', 'harmony', 'records', 'anybody', 'know', 'can', 'sing', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'hearing', 'missed', 'part', 'flat', 'note', 'here', 'there', 'wish', ""'d"", 'just', 'mixed', 'Good', 'Timin', 'way', 'was', 'real', 'beauty', 'here', 'seeing', 'Boys', 'playing', 'together', 'very', 'last', 'time']","Beach Boys: Good Timin - Live at Knebworth, England 1980"

Kraut,"[7, 7]","The Beach Boys have been unfairly trivialized for their superficial, fun-in-the-sun approach to their art, but the criticism is both unfair and ironic. Behind the wave catching and gettin' around, the Wilson brothers, their cousin, Mike Love and their friends Al Jardine and, later, Bruce Johnston, could match any obviously dark band for its share of turmoil, volatility and pain. Furthermore, their music, thanks in part, but by no means completely, to brother Brian, is actually some of the most profoundly moving, innovative and relentlessly melodic material America has produced.Okay, so there's the legend.And here at Knebworth, we get a chance to witness the final embers of that creative fire. I was expecting less from Brian, who actually turns in an okay bridge to Surfer Girl and seems fairly in command of his keyboard. Dennis, just as I remember him, is liquid on feet and iron behind his drums. When he's up front, he's barely holding on, the apparently huge amount of alcohol and/or drugs threatening to wash him away. There's an unsettling instability to him that made me anxious, as it did when I saw him and the Beach Boys live in 1980 (without Brian). But when he's playing, he anchors the entire band, let alone himself. It's an amazing contrast. Mike's self-indulgence and dumb stage humor are less annoying, more benign than in many shows I've seen. He's also in good voice, unlike Dennis, whose vocal cords were so ravaged by abuse by then that even doing his Joe Cocker bit was beyond him. (To hear incredible Dennis singing - and writing - go back three years to his magnificent Pacific Ocean Blue.) Al and Bruce are as ever, solid and capable, while not really standing out. Bruce has no solo singing and Al just manages to hold on while the band rushes through Heroes & Villains. (The stellar, more recent performances of Heroes by Brian and his own band do the song much more justice.) And then there's Carl, who was always most moving to me in concert back in those days. God Only Knows alone would justify the purchase of this DVD. But for my all time favorite moment, let's go back to Dennis and Surfer Girl: In the front line, singing between Mike and Carl (I think) he announces the entrance of Brian's solo voice, ""And now ladies and gentlemen, Brian Wilson!"" Brian comes in with the bridge, ""We could ride the surf together..."" (Nice metaphor for the Beach Boys' journey.) As Brian takes off into these lines, the camera comes back to Dennis, thankfully, catching an indescribably precious smile that reflects a depth of pride, love and gratitude toward his older brother that cuts through everything else. It's a sublime moment.If you're a lover of the Beach Boys, you have to have this show. If not, it's a good start, although, as I said - along with everyone else commenting on it - it's really more of an ending.",5,A Wonderful Last Gasp,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,2852,"['Beach', 'Boys', 'have', 'been', 'unfairly', 'trivialized', 'superficial', 'fun-in-the-sun', 'approach', 'art', 'criticism', 'unfair', 'ironic', 'wave', 'catching', 'gettin', 'around', 'Wilson', 'brothers', 'cousin', 'Mike', 'Love', 'friends', 'Al', 'Jardine', 'later', 'Bruce', 'Johnston', 'could', 'match', 'obviously', 'dark', 'band', 'share', 'turmoil', 'volatility', 'pain', 'Furthermore', 'music', 'thanks', 'part', 'means', 'completely', 'brother', 'Brian', 'actually', 'most', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'innovative', 'relentlessly', 'melodic', 'material', 'America', 'produced.Okay', 'legend.And', 'here', 'Knebworth', 'get', 'chance', 'witness', 'final', 'embers', 'creative', 'fire', 'was', 'expecting', 'less', 'Brian', 'who', 'actually', 'okay', 'bridge', 'Surfer', 'Girl', 'fairly', 'command', 'keyboard', 'Dennis', 'just', 'remember', 'liquid', 'feet', 'iron', 'drums', 'When', 'up', 'front', 'barely', 'holding', 'apparently', 'huge', 'amount', 'alcohol', 'and/or', 'drugs', 'threatening', 'wash', 'away', 'unsettling', 'instability', 'made', 'anxious', 'did', 'when', 'saw', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'live', '1980', 'Brian', 'when', 'playing', 'entire', 'band', 'let', 'alone', 'amazing', 'contrast', 'Mike', 'self-indulgence', 'dumb', 'stage', 'humor', 'are', 'less', 'annoying', 'more', 'benign', 'many', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'also', 'good', 'voice', 'Dennis', 'vocal', 'cords', 'were', 'so', 'ravaged', 'abuse', 'then', 'even', 'doing', 'Joe', 'Cocker', 'bit', 'was', 'hear', 'incredible', 'Dennis', 'singing', 'writing', 'go', 'back', 'three', 'years', 'magnificent', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'Blue', 'Al', 'Bruce', 'are', 'ever', 'solid', 'capable', 'not', 'really', 'standing', 'out', 'Bruce', 'solo', 'singing', 'Al', 'just', 'hold', 'band', 'Heroes', 'Villains', 'stellar', 'more', 'recent', 'performances', 'Heroes', 'Brian', 'own', 'band', 'do', 'song', 'much', 'more', 'justice', 'then', 'Carl', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'most', 'moving', 'concert', 'back', 'days', 'God', 'Only', 'alone', 'would', 'justify', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'time', 'favorite', 'moment', 'let', 'go', 'back', 'Dennis', 'Surfer', 'Girl', 'front', 'line', 'singing', 'Mike', 'Carl', 'think', 'entrance', 'Brian', 'solo', 'voice', 'now', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'Brian', 'bridge', 'could', 'ride', 'surf', 'together', 'Nice', 'metaphor', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'journey', 'Brian', 'off', 'lines', 'camera', 'back', 'Dennis', 'thankfully', 'catching', 'indescribably', 'precious', 'smile', 'depth', 'pride', 'love', 'gratitude', 'older', 'brother', 'everything', 'else', 'sublime', 'moment.If', ""'re"", 'lover', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'have', 'have', 'show', 'not', 'good', 'start', 'said', 'everyone', 'else', 'commenting', 'really', 'more', 'ending']","Beach Boys: Good Timin - Live at Knebworth, England 1980"

True, they have no new music and true, only one original member is intact, but to be honest, I think ""Pet Sounds"" was the last good Beach Boys album.That's why I love this DVD.  They tend to stick to their early classics during this concert, such as ""California Girls,"" ""Little Deuce Coupe,"" ""Surfin' USA,"" etc.  They don't rely heavily on their 1970s material.  I think by this time, the golden oldies tour formula was beginning to take effect, and in my view, that only makes this a better concert.  Most Beach Boys fans say that the 1972 ""In Concert"" CD is the definitive concert from the band, but very few of their early hits were presented on that one.

It was close to midnight, so the day was almost over. What a way to bring it to an end. We were clapping, singing, and dancing along. I had the CD, but to actually see it was a completely different experience.By 1980, these guys had been through quite a few turbulent times- squabbles inside the group, Brian's mental illness and drug abuse, Denny's drug and alcohol abuse, the departure and return of Bruce Johnston... However, you tend to not focus on any of that so much when you are listening to the music at this concert, which was the last time all six of them would perform together on stage in the UK. I was amazed by how different their sound was. Although the sunny feeling of their music was still present, there was a rough edge to it, which sounded good. For instance, ""Little Deuce Coupe"" sounded like a hard rock song. They also performed their latest song ""Keepin' The Summer Alive"". Carl Wilson, who wrote it and sang lead, was so into it, he broke one of the strings on his guitar.You could sense some underlying tension on stage at times. During ""Surfer Girl"", you could see Mike get apprehensive when Dennis left the drums to stand next to him. The two were known for having a very volatile relationship. Carl's mind seemed to wander at times. He would take an absence from the group for about a year, starting in 1981. He wanted to go out on his own, and pursue other kinds of music. Al and Bruce seemed just happy to be there, while Mike seemed to get his biggest kick out of conversing with the audience. As for Brian, he sang a few lines of ""Surfer Girl"" and ""Sloop John B"", but he was mostly concentrating on playing piano. Denny was wild on the drums, giving it all he had. He was highly animated the entire time.Although it was a cold and rainy night, the crowd was not fazed by it. They were having a great time. I had a great time too, watching it.

This may be one of the last  recorded performances which included all five of those Beach Boys.It really saddens me that Dennis and Carl are no longer here.  It is fairly rare to see Dennis sing, despite some comments from other reviewers regarding his singing.  Too bad, that there aren't more vocal performances from him.

I am pleased to have this show to watch to remind me of just how talented these guys were before the excess of drugs, alcohol, and everything else corrupted their youthful genius.

742800,A1EOEYW5SMC6CV,B00008HCB8,S. R.,"[19, 24]","Mike Love is his usual dork-on-speed self, talking over song endings, making light of certain songs, and just generally being and idiot on stage. Dennis Wilson looks completely wasted and manages to stumble through half of the bands material. (even making a mistake with a false ending on a song) Brian looks, and acts like a zombie pounding chords on the piano. (You even get to read Al's lips as he walks over to Brian to  and ask if he's okay). The DVD is really a glimps in the dysfunctional family that was the Beach Boys, and a bit surprising that it was not edited heavily to remove all this stuff. But it was not, and that's why I respect the Beach Boys a lot, they didn't try and hide their dysfunction, they wore it loud and proud because they really had no choice, but they carried on. Kudos to them. At one point duirng the show Mike Love speaks to a dazed Dennis who seems to ignore him, so Love starts to move in closer very quickly to Dennis, just then Carl grabs Love by the arm and stops him. It's all very low key, I don't want to seem to sound like they're coming close to fisticuffs on stage, but everyone knows Love is an agressive, dominating personality, as well as the shortcomings of Dennis Wilson as a professional performer being well documented, as is Mike Love's short temper and lack of tact. Al Jardine gives a terrific performance handling the vocals and rythm guitar. Carl Wilson gives a stellar performance singing and playing guitar. What does this mean?

742801,AQ81L25HHHB18,B00008HCB8,S.W.,"[1, 3]","As I said in another review, I'm not big on live material in general, but I saw this DVD in a 2-disc set (with the CD version) for cheap, so I decided to give them a try. As big of a Beach Boys fan as I am, I am not terribly inpressed with this DVD. The picture quality is really not that good; it's rather grainy. I know this is because the concert was filmed in 1980, not 2011, but looking at it today feels a bit weird to me. I think the performances, or most of them, sound O.K., but I still much prefer the group's studio recordings. About the only performance here that I think genuinely stinks is Dennis' rendition of ""You Are So Beautiful."" Visually, I think that a couple of the group members look good, or pretty good, while others appear rather, well, shabby. The five ""original"" members (Al, Mike, and the Wilsons) had changed a LOT since the '60s. Bruce, who incidentally is the only member who lacks facial hair, looks the best (to me, anyway). Al looks much older than he is, especially in the close-up shots (look at those wrinkles!). Brian indeed looks as though he has ""let himself go"" (again? This wasn't the first time, was it?). I also think it's both kind of creepy and kind of funny to see Mike, the oldest member of the group --- and with a beard --- posturing like a girl! I assume he's doing it intentionally, at least on ""California Girls,"" though that's not the only song that he does it (or seems to me to do it) on! I'm disappointed that the ""bonus"" commentary by the group members is just in text form, not in live interviews, which were what I was expecting. Overall, I like this DVD, but don't love it. I'll probably listen to the CD (on which, by the way, the material is slightly different) more often than I'll watch the DVD, which likely won't be very often.",3,like it but don't love it,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,1795,"['said', 'review', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'live', 'material', 'general', 'saw', 'DVD', '2-disc', 'set', 'CD', 'version', 'cheap', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'big', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'fan', 'am', 'am', 'not', 'terribly', 'inpressed', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'really', 'not', 'good', 'rather', 'grainy', 'know', 'concert', 'was', 'filmed', '1980', 'not', '2011', 'looking', 'today', 'bit', 'weird', 'think', 'performances', 'most', 'sound', 'O.K.', 'still', 'much', 'prefer', 'group', 'studio', 'recordings', 'only', 'performance', 'here', 'think', 'genuinely', 'stinks', 'Dennis', 'rendition', 'Are', 'So', 'Beautiful', 'Visually', 'think', 'couple', 'group', 'members', 'look', 'good', 'pretty', 'good', 'others', 'appear', 'rather', 'well', 'shabby', 'five', 'original', 'members', 'Al', 'Mike', 'Wilsons', 'had', 'changed', 'LOT', ""'60s"", 'Bruce', 'who', 'incidentally', 'only', 'member', 'who', 'facial', 'hair', 'best', 'anyway', 'Al', 'much', 'older', 'especially', 'close-up', 'shots', 'look', 'wrinkles', 'Brian', 'indeed', 'let', 'go', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'think', 'kind', 'creepy', 'kind', 'funny', 'see', 'Mike', 'oldest', 'member', 'group', 'beard', 'posturing', 'girl', 'assume', 'doing', 'intentionally', 'least', 'California', 'Girls', 'not', 'only', 'song', 'do', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'bonus', 'commentary', 'group', 'members', 'just', 'text', 'form', 'not', 'live', 'interviews', 'were', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'Overall', 'like', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'listen', 'CD', 'way', 'material', 'slightly', 'different', 'more', 'often', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'DVD', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'very', 'often']","Beach Boys: Good Timin - Live at Knebworth, England 1980"

While I watching, I actually felt embarrassed for them, because they struggled so mightily to stay in tune and keep up with one another. The vocals were awful and the guys must have been aware they had seen better days. Brian made it all happen and Mike was the glue later. I thought Brian looked really old and haggard and dazed even though he had just turned 38 the day before the concert. Dennis was in some sort of stupor and sang the worst rendition of You Are So Beautiful"" that is humanly possible. But as the end of the DVD approached, it was like seeing some older friends for the last time, warts and all....and they didn't really care even though they wanted the crowd to be happy. And that's all they can do. It's good music and  a good time. It doesn't feel quite the same watching a DVD of some over the hill guys who should probably have realized their waning talent years before. Their harmonies used to be heaven sent, and now it's a train wreck. But I'm glad I got to share their last time together in the UK. We don't discard old friends.
