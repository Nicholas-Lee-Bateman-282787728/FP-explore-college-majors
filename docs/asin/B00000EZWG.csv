I researched the 'Net for &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; tapes and this was the most comprehensive set I could find.  What a find it is!!  The first time I watched this series, I would only let myself watch one episode a day, knowing that I had a limited supply of episodes.  I have now watched the series three times, and I have no plans to leave it in the back of my video collection any time soon.Each guest is interviewed for a while before they play the actual game.  During these interviews, you not only see people from a generation that is almost extinct, but also Groucho's wit and quick mind at full force.  No matter what the circumstance, he is always ON and ready for more.  (Side note: It is particularly interesting to look at the guests and see what they understood and what made them laugh.  This series indirectly allows you to meet people who have lived through WWII - and some through WWI.)You will have terrific fun watching this.  I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in Groucho, the Marx Brothers, or jumping in a time machine to see what it was like in the middle of the last century. (The game show questions are fun to play along with, too!)",5,Elephant in my PJ's,978307200,"01 1, 2001",2001,1214,"['must', 'Groucho', 'fans', 'researched', ""'Net"", 'quot', 'Bet', 'Life', 'quot', 'tapes', 'was', 'most', 'comprehensive', 'set', 'could', 'find', 'What', 'find', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'series', 'would', 'only', 'let', 'watch', 'one', 'episode', 'day', 'knowing', 'had', 'limited', 'supply', 'episodes', 'have', 'now', 'watched', 'series', 'three', 'times', 'have', 'plans', 'leave', 'back', 'video', 'collection', 'time', 'soon.Each', 'guest', 'interviewed', 'while', 'play', 'actual', 'game', 'interviews', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'people', 'generation', 'almost', 'extinct', 'also', 'Groucho', 'wit', 'quick', 'mind', 'full', 'force', 'matter', 'what', 'circumstance', 'always', 'ON', 'ready', 'more', 'Side', 'note', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'look', 'guests', 'see', 'what', 'understood', 'what', 'made', 'laugh', 'series', 'indirectly', 'meet', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'WWII', 'WWI', 'will', 'have', 'terrific', 'fun', 'watching', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'interest', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'jumping', 'time', 'machine', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'middle', 'last', 'century', 'game', 'show', 'questions', 'are', 'fun', 'play', 'along', 'too']",You Bet Your Life: Groucho Marx VHS

Fiebiger,"[0, 1]","I wish the DVD producers would get organized and list the episodes by the date they originally aired, the secret word for each episode, and the names of the first two guests, on both the DVD covers and on Amazon and other sales web sites, so collectors of ""YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" episodes can figure out which ones they have, and which ones they still need to buy,Far too many 'YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" DVDs are just re-hashes of the same episodes that have appeared on other DVDs, and VHS tapes, repackaged with different artwork and names for the covers, some leaving out some episodes to cash in on the interest in ""YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" episodes by splitting them into multiple volumes from larger compilations.Several hundred episodes were filmed and aired over a period of almost 14 years, and so it's frustrating to find the same relatively few episodes cropping up again and again on almost every DVD compilation.From the fragmented descriptions from other reviewers of this volume, it sounds like this is another one of those re-hash collections, and thus isn't worth the effort to buy.Until it's re-released with the above-mentioned specifics about all the episodes contained in it, this gets only one star in my book.Dan Fiebiger",1,RE-HASH OF OTHER DVDs,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,1227,"['wish', 'DVD', 'producers', 'would', 'get', 'organized', 'list', 'episodes', 'date', 'originally', 'aired', 'secret', 'word', 'episode', 'names', 'first', 'two', 'guests', 'DVD', 'covers', 'Amazon', 'other', 'sales', 'sites', 'collectors', 'YOU', 'BET', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'episodes', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'ones', 'have', 'ones', 'still', 'need', 'buy', 'Far', 'too', 'many', 'BET', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'DVDs', 'are', 'just', 're-hashes', 'same', 'episodes', 'have', 'appeared', 'other', 'DVDs', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'repackaged', 'different', 'artwork', 'names', 'covers', 'leaving', 'out', 'episodes', 'cash', 'interest', 'YOU', 'BET', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'episodes', 'splitting', 'multiple', 'volumes', 'larger', 'compilations.Several', 'hundred', 'episodes', 'were', 'filmed', 'aired', 'period', 'almost', '14', 'years', 'frustrating', 'find', 'same', 'relatively', 'few', 'episodes', 'cropping', 'up', 'again', 'again', 'almost', 'DVD', 'fragmented', 'descriptions', 'other', 'reviewers', 'volume', 'one', 're-hash', 'collections', 'thus', ""n't"", 'worth', 'effort', 'buy.Until', 're-released', 'above-mentioned', 'specifics', 'episodes', 'contained', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'book.Dan', 'Fiebiger']",You Bet Your Life: Groucho Marx VHS

Here is an example of part of one episode from memory.I watched this when I was a teenager in the 50s. I caught a few episodes on cable around ten years ago. It wears well. Groucho was a master at the double entendre. Mae West had nothing on him. One example: there was a married couple who had 19 children. Groucho asked the man why they had so many kids. The man said it was because he liked his wife. Groucho replied, &quot;I like my cigar too, but I take it out once in a while.&quot; This was more than 40 years ago, it is still timely.

Massaar ""Len Massaar""","[15, 18]","Let's face it; if you're a fan of this genius, you could see scratchy 8mm silent home movies of the back of his head and be entertained &amp; fulfilled. However, this DVD is simply a recording of three shows made in the early 60s (the show originally started in the 50s) so it was near the end of it all and was probably Groucho at his best (older &amp; slower in years, but still quick-witted and sharp as a fish knife).I was disappointed that this DVD wasn't clever extracts from that whole decade that the show ran; instead it was simply three recordings, albeit classic ones. Even the commercial breaks were missing (which would have been kewl to leave in to add to the whole 60s ambiance).Fans expecting the famous 'cigar' quip (&quot;...but Groucho I love my wife...&quot; to which he replied &quot;...I love my cigar, but I take it out once in a while...&quot;) will be disappointed.

A technical note: The video producers have restored the original network titles to the films, but  a few of the episodes were edited (by some TV station, before the video  company got them), so some of Groucho's interviews are disappointingly  short.
