1221549,A1TXPWO46J0PPQ,B001O2UTQS,Anastasia Beaverhausen,"[3, 3]","""Choke"" definitely isn't for everyone: The audience is limited by the subject matter (sex addiction) and tone (dark comedy). Fans of off-beat independent films will find ""Choke"" goes down easy. It's similar in tone to the comedies ""Igby Goes Down"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", so if you dug those films, you will probably get a kick out of ""Choke"".The film spent over eight years in development, as the director struggled to adapt the novel. The book's structure, with frequent flashbacks and a wandering plot, wasn't easily adaptable. As a fan of the book, I was surprised at how much of Chuck Palahniuk's book ended up on the screen. Gregg's version of ""Choke"" feels heavier on the sex than the choking, but that might just be the visual impact of the on-screen nudity.Sam Rockwell IS Victor Mancini. He perfectly captures the spirit of the novel, and his deadpan delivery is spot-on. Brad William Henke, as Victor's best friend, is a star in the making. Kelly Macdonald, as Dr. Paige Marshall, brings vulnerability to her character...although she's not as convincing a doctor as Marshall seemed in the book.One of the best roles, however, goes to writer/director/actor Clark Gregg, who plays Lord High Charlie. Although the character wasn't central to the novel, Gregg is hilarious as the uptight colonial re-enacter. ""F***in' knaves,"" he says at one point.The DVD is pitched as ""from the author of Fight Club,"" but this isn't ""Fight Club""--the pace is slower, and there's no violence.

The story goes something like this--a sex-addict pulls choking scams at restraunts in order to swindle cash for his dying mother who is safeguarding the truth about her son's childhood.  Sound insane?  It's also genius, irreverent, funny, and sexually-charged, this is one of the smartest and raunchiest comedies out right now.Meet Victor Mancini(Sam Rockwell), he is a petulant, sarcastic, and slightly morose sex addict who works at a cheesy colonial theme park.  He goes to some self-help meetings, but instead of finding therapy he finds some more easy scores.  His best friend isn't much of a help either, seeing how he got kicked out of art school for flogging the dolphin during a classroom nude model sketch.We slowly learn some of the reasons that most likely led to Victor's uncontrollable libido.  His half-crazy mother(Anjelica Huston) holds much of these secrets, but she is about to kick the bucket.  Oh, what to do?Somehow Chuck is able to use dark satire on a gloomy subject and make it interesting and hilarious.  Lots of nudity and sexual content, this is a twisted comedy for adults only.  Some elements do seem pretty hokey, but this is offset by some of the funniest bedroom scenes you'll ever see (like the simulated rape encounter OMG!).  4.5 stars, highly recommended!",4,"A hilarious offbeat comedy about sex, death, and choking",1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,1363,"['Only', 'gleefully', 'demented', 'mind', 'Chuck', 'Palahniuk', 'Fight', 'Club', 'story', 'something', 'sex-addict', 'pulls', 'choking', 'scams', 'restraunts', 'order', 'swindle', 'cash', 'dying', 'mother', 'who', 'safeguarding', 'truth', 'son', 'childhood', 'Sound', 'insane', 'also', 'genius', 'irreverent', 'funny', 'sexually-charged', 'one', 'smartest', 'raunchiest', 'comedies', 'out', 'right', 'now.Meet', 'Victor', 'Mancini', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'petulant', 'sarcastic', 'slightly', 'morose', 'sex', 'addict', 'who', 'cheesy', 'colonial', 'theme', 'park', 'self-help', 'meetings', 'instead', 'finding', 'therapy', 'more', 'easy', 'scores', 'best', 'friend', ""n't"", 'much', 'help', 'either', 'seeing', 'how', 'got', 'kicked', 'art', 'school', 'flogging', 'dolphin', 'classroom', 'nude', 'model', 'sketch.We', 'slowly', 'learn', 'reasons', 'most', 'likely', 'led', 'Victor', 'uncontrollable', 'libido', 'half-crazy', 'mother', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'much', 'secrets', 'kick', 'bucket', 'Oh', 'what', 'do', 'Somehow', 'Chuck', 'able', 'use', 'dark', 'satire', 'gloomy', 'subject', 'make', 'interesting', 'hilarious', 'Lots', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'content', 'twisted', 'comedy', 'adults', 'only', 'elements', 'do', 'seem', 'pretty', 'hokey', 'offset', 'funniest', 'bedroom', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'simulated', 'rape', 'encounter', 'OMG', '4.5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
1221553,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001O2UTQS,Chris Pandolfi,"[22, 24]","""Choke"" is so bizarre that I really don't know what to make of it. It's a fascinating film, but its eccentricities are at times so overplayed that it felt like they were being drilled into my head. The very concept doesn't sit that well with me. It tells the story of a sex addict who cons rich people out of their money by pretending to choke in upscale restaurants. He does this, you see, because he has hospital bills to pay, all of which go towards the care of his mentally ill mother. Basically, ""Choke"" is a strange film about really strange people. That may be part of the film's appeal, I guess, as is the fact that, in a demented sort of way, it's actually very funny, although I'd be lying if I said that I completely understood the sense of humor. This adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel has a charm about it that's oddly disturbing, which is to say that not all audiences are going to respond to it.""Choke"" begins in much the same way as another Palahniuk adaptation, ""Fight Club"": the main character/narrator, Victor Mancini (Sam Rockwell), is introduced at a twelve-step meeting with other sex addicts (one of which is played by Joel Grey). And much like Edward Norton's character, Victor doesn't go for the therapy--he goes to meet women, and he spends quite a bit of time with the woman he's supposed to be sponsoring. When he's not having sex in dimly lit rooms or at restaurants begging for the Heimlich maneuver, he gets by as an historical tour guide for a Colonial-era theme park. He doesn't get along with his superior, Lord High Charlie (Clark Gregg, the film's writer and director), who always insists on keeping everything as historically accurate as possible. The two cardinal rules: No modern amenities, and absolutely no modern English. Victor works with his best friend, Denny (Brad William Henke), also a sex addict; he eventually falls in love with an exotic dancer named Cherry Daiquiri (it's not her real name).Victor's sexual escapades aren't limited to his addiction meetings. He has had passionate encounters with virtually every nurse at the mental hospital housing his mother, Ida (Anjelica Houston). She's a surprisingly sad character, and not just because she doesn't recognize her own son when he visits; through a series of flashback sequences (which I won't describe), we discover that she wasn't that good a person. It's likely that years of guilt (and sniffing glue sticks) have contributed to her mental decline, which is probably why she wants to reveal a secret to Victor, one that would explain where he came from. This would mean a lot to Victor, who never knew his father. Unfortunately, since Ida always thinks Victor is someone else, he's no closer to learning the truth. It doesn't help that he can't let go of the past, with years of resentment holding him back.This brings me to Paige Marshall (Kelly Macdonald), who appears to be Ida's doctor. Victor immediately finds her interesting, mostly because she's the only health care specialist he hasn't slept with. She initially refuses to give into him. She does, however, care deeply Victor's mother, which is why she proposes ... let's just say an interesting method of restoring Ida's mental condition (no need to spoil it for you). Then Victor discovers his mother's old journal, written in Italian. Fortunately, Paige knows the language, so she can translate it for him. Hopefully, it will have the answers Victor is looking for. Paige eventually gives him ... let's just say an interesting explanation for where he came from (no need to spoil this one, either). Needless to say, Victor tries to have sex with Paige. But for the first time, something prevents him from going all the way. Maybe it's because she offers herself in the middle of the hospital's chapel. Could you get aroused with a crucified statue of Jesus staring down at you? Or maybe it's because Victor actually likes Paige and wants to know her as a person.I told you this was a strange movie. But that doesn't mean I disliked it. The unusual characters and offbeat plot constantly made me wonder where the film would go next, and I have to say that it was a strangely satisfying experience. I won't go so far as to say that I understood it, but I certainly enjoyed trying to figure it out. As for Victor, he isn't as clear-cut a character as you might think. No one ever is. Consider the scene after he answers a personal ad on an adult website; the woman he meets is sexually stimulated by the thought of being raped, so she wants him to wear a stocking over his head and carry a knife. But the experience is a disaster for them both because he doesn't want to follow her rules. Never mind the fact that she actually has rules for a successful rape--the simple fact is that, at that moment, a sex addict is unable to do what he does best. Why? Because he's thinking of Paige? Because he only likes submissive women? Your guess is as good as mine.Another way ""Choke"" is similar to ""Fight Club"" is that it ends with a plot twist that reverses half of what you think you know. As with most plot twists, the plausibility factor will likely undermine the cleverness, which in turn will undermine the message. How I feel about it, I'm still not entirely sure. I can say the same thing about the film in general. ""Choke"" prides itself on being an oddity, telling a story many won't understand about characters many can't identify with. That being said, I was intrigued all throughout. I found myself involved with the characters, and I wanted to know how the plot would be resolved. I'm recommending this movie, but it's obviously not going to appeal to everyone.",4,Too Big to Swallow Whole,1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,5639,"['Choke', 'so', 'bizarre', 'really', 'do', ""n't"",

1221554,A12RMAJXRPQWTY,B001O2UTQS,C.Wallace,"[0, 0]","Sam Rockwell deftly portrays Victor Mancini, a self-confessed sex addict. He supports himself and pays for his mother's stay at an expensive facility for mentally ill elderly ladies (?) by playing an Irish indentured servant in a cheesy historical reenactment village based on colonial America. He supplements this income by purposely choking in various restaurants. After a stranger rescues Victor by performing the Heimlich maneuver, Victor asks this person for money, taking advantage of the rescuer's sentimental regard for Victor. (Strange? Very.)Angelica Huston shines as Victor's mother, Ida, who goes in and out of sanity. Mostly out. Often, she does not recognize Victor. She refuses to eat, creating a central crisis in the film. Huston does a great job aging thirty years after flashbacks from the eighties when Victor (Jonah Bobo) was a boy.Sometimes it's a fine line that separates comedy from idiocy. A key part of the story is Victor's desire to find his father. Ida has only told Victor that his father was a traveling salesman with Tourette syndrome! I feel this film drifts into idiocy when it mocks some fundamental Christian beliefs during the search for Victor's ""roots.""I have not read the novel on which this film is based. The author is Chuck Palahniuk, who also wrote Fight Club.

1221555,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001O2UTQS,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Choke is not a horrible film, it's also not a great film. There seems to be a fair amount of advertising or hype around this movie, and it just doesn't seem deserved.The problem with Choke, it can't figure out if it's a big budget, high profile actor film, or an indie film. Angelica Houston turns in a fine performance as Victor's mother. Clark Gregg (Just Shoot Me and The New Adventures of Old Christine) does a decent job being a mean by the book character. Sam Rockwell, the star of the film, is reasonably good (Matchstickmen, Snow Angels, Lawn Dogs, and The Assassination of Jesse James). The rest of the cast varies from unknowns bringing in really good performances to just reading their lines. The filming was done on the cheap, or at least appears to be done on the cheap. No great sets, no perfect lighting or sound, just simple sets.It's just so hard to figure out what this film is about. Victor is a sex addict that basically couples with everyone, so there's those scenes along with conversations about being an addict. Victor is also trying to frequently visit his mother in the home, but she doesn't recognize him. There's also flashbacks to Victor's childhood as an orphan. And the movie's title comes from Victor faking choking in restaurants to make money. The viewer also finds out that Victor is supposed to be the cloned son of Christ.At this point, if you are confused, join the club. Although the film had a decent story line and moved along well, it just got so lost along the way.Production values. The editing was consistently well done. The film is about the right length. Exposure and focus are decent. And the sound was well recorded, dialog was clear. This is actually saying a lot, a film that has all these things right should be the norm, but sadly it isn't.Who would enjoy this film? It's a tough audience. There's a lot of random coupling, remember Victor's problem. There's a lot of talk about coupling and self pleasuring. There's also a thread about people in a home.

The filmmakers probably loathe any comparisons to Fight Club, Palahniuk's most famous property, but with a similarly sarcastic tone, grim protagonist and writhing, unpredictable plot, it's difficult not to tie the two together in some meaningful ways. Choke barely holds a candle to its daunting big brother, sadly; it captures none of the character or idealism that made Tyler Durden's darker hues so palatable, and the dialog - though witty in a few spots - is largely lacking in conviction and flavor. Sam Rockwell's turn as Victor, a sex-addicted scam artist in the midst of a midlife crisis, is uncharacteristically dull and bland. It's tough to root for, or even identify with, such a despicable character, even as his journey reveals the details of why he is this way. The storyline, explained via a series of long-winded, single-minded monologues, branches off in so many directions, it's often difficult to determine what's the primary message and what's just window dressing.

Just ask the old lady who sat a row behind me in the theater and continually exclaimed, ""This is just so . . . weird,"" in five minute intervals throughout the entire movie. She'll tell you. Really, ask her.Having read the book before seeing the film, I had a pretty firm understanding of what was to come. The basic story revolves around Victor Mancini, the sex addicted period re-enacting son of a severely demented mother suffering from Alzheimer's. Confused yet? Just wait, it gets better. He strip club scene from also dropped out of medical school. Oh, and he has a best friend who starts a rock collection to build a monument to nothing. Also, his mother always thinks he's someone different. Yeah, it's involved.I wondered after reading the book how anyone would ever be able to make it into a movie. Chuck Palahniuk, the book's author, commonly involves several differing story strands that tie in to one large, dramatic revelation in the end. If you have no idea what I'm talking about watch the first movie made from one of his books, ""Fight Club"". It is a prime example.The good news is that what makes ""Choke"" confusing is also what makes it great. As a viewer you find yourself perpetually meandering around in Victor's confusing life wondering what it all means. Like most people, I am all too familiar with this feeling and therefore found myself connecting with the character through all of his most bizarre foibles. Greg also manages to keep the interpretive nature of the ending in tact so that even when the film reaches a conclusion you will still find yourself asking what has happened. Some people may find this to be too much work, or simply too . . . weird, much like the lady sitting behind me. To those people I have to say, ""Pipe down.

As bizarre as it sounds, there is more to shove into this movie than can be eloquently and succinctly described in a review.  And that's part of the problem.The protagonist/narrator, Victor Mancini (Sam Rockwell), has serious issues.  In between his trysts and hospital visits, he supplements his charitable income by working in a reenactment of a colonial village where nearly everyone flouts the rules whenever unseen by tourists.  The efforts are all for his mother (Anjelica Huston), a woman that continually abandoned him as a child after teaching him unnecessary lessons while foregoing the responsibilities of a parent.  A child's love, however, brings him back to his mother time and time again, even in the hospital when she confuses her son for various acquaintances like lawyers and doctors.  To muddy the waters even further, he notices Paige Marshall at the hospital, pretty much because she's the only female at the hospital he hasn't bedded.  With Paige's help, Victor attempts to learn the identity of his father, cure his addiction, and help his mother.The details of Palahniuk books are too thoroughly bizarre, the prose too verbose to adequately squeeze down the throat of a two hour movie.  It's not that the movie is poorly made; in fact, it's quite entertaining.  It's just that there are far too many details removed to accurately translate from book to movie.  However, seeing flashbacks of the numerous sexual conquests, as well the Alzheimer encounters with his mother, are the random vignettes that make a Palahniuk story so completely his own gonzo style, and completely enjoyable.Just like Fight Club, the perverse, backward psychology permeates throughout the dialogue, and despite the illogical nature at times, it often makes sense.  I suppose that's the treat of all Palahniuk's works; one must appreciate the bizarre to get to the meat of the story.  Highly recommended for the originality, but if you've read the book already, and enjoyed it, you may be disappointed a bit.",4,"As off the wall as Fight Club, but not quite as polished",1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,2306,"['When', 'sex', 'addict', 'purposely', 'oversized', 'portions', 'food', 'up-scale', 'restaurants', 'just', 'can', 'get', 'sympathy', 'cards', 'money', 'gifts', 'wealthy', 'restaurant', 'patrons', 'can', 'pay', 'mother', 'medical', 'bills', 'then', 'know', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Chuck', 'Palahniuk', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'As', 'bizarre', 'more', 'shove', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'eloquently', 'succinctly', 'described', 'review', 'part', 'problem.The', 'protagonist/narrator', 'Victor', 'Mancini', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'serious', 'issues', 'trysts', 'hospital', 'visits', 'charitable', 'income', 'working', 'reenactment', 'colonial', 'village', 'where', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'rules', 'whenever', 'unseen', 'tourists', 'efforts', 'are', 'mother', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'woman', 'continually', 'abandoned', 'child', 'teaching', 'unnecessary', 'lessons', 'foregoing', 'responsibilities', 'parent', 'child', 'love', 'however', 'back', 'mother', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'even', 'hospital', 'when', 'son', 'various', 'acquaintances', 'lawyers', 'doctors', 'muddy', 'waters', 'even', 'further', 'Paige', 'Marshall', 'hospital', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'female', 'hospital', ""n't"", 'bedded', 'Paige', 'help', 'Victor', 'learn', 'identity', 'father', 'cure', 'addiction', 'help', 'mother.The', 'details', 'Palahniuk', 'books', 'are', 'too', 'thoroughly', 'bizarre', 'prose', 'too', 'verbose', 'adequately', 'squeeze', 'down', 'throat', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'not', 'movie', 'poorly', 'made', 'fact', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'just', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'removed', 'accurately', 'translate', 'book', 'movie', 'However', 'seeing', 'flashbacks', 'numerous', 'sexual', 'conquests', 'as', 'well', 'Alzheimer', 'encounters', 'mother', 'are', 'random', 'make', 'Palahniuk', 'story', 'so', 'completely', 'own', 'gonzo', 'style', 'completely', 'enjoyable.Just', 'Fight', 'Club', 'perverse', 'backward', 'psychology', 'permeates', 'dialogue', 'illogical', 'nature', 'times', 'often', 'sense', 'suppose', 'treat', 'Palahniuk', 'works', 'one', 'must', 'appreciate', 'bizarre', 'get', 'meat', 'story', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'originality', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'already', 'enjoyed', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'bit']",N/A

After reading CHOKE, I listened to the book on CD and was impressed by Palahniuk's reading and interview which followed.  Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed in the DVD for a number of reasons which I'll briefly describe.  For a film that was less than 90 minutes in length, it felt long in keeping my interest.  The acting was inconsistent although the characters were well developed, and I found myself wishing Sam Rockwell, not the character Victor Mancini, would actually choke and be removed from the set.  I wanted Anjelica Hutson, not the character Ida Mancini, to  walk out of the home and let someone else take the bed.  As the younger Ida, I felt she was no younger than the elder character, just dressed more darkly to convince us of her dark personality.  Paige Marshall as Kelly Macdonald worked well and the characters emotions were evident in each scene.  I thought that Beth was so benign that she could have been represented by a different actress for each of her hair styles.  Brad William Henke as Denny was so believable, especially as he caressed his rocks.  Joel Grey was superb as a stalking sexual addict in recovery.  I guess I just preferred the men in shorts in this film.  For me, the weakness of this film was in the delivery of a very serious message which was spoonfed at the end, demonstrating a weakness in the script's success in conveying the storyline on it's own.  Perhaps if I had not been familiar with Palahniuk's original work, I would not be so critical, but I can't undo what's been done.  If you have the time and interest in seeing how sexual addiction, human frailties, the symbiotic relationship between a mother and her son, lusting for love, and the reasons Victor Mancini works in a puritanical Colonial American theme park and chokes for rebirthing, monetary compensation and emotional fulfillment, then I'd recommend reading or listening to the novel instead of the film.

If he had just been a grifter who pretended to choke when he wanted a patron, that might have been cool.

He was a protegee of David Mamet.  He takes what I understand to be a complex book and creates an engaging screenplay.  The character he plays in the film, the Lord High Charlie, was not a factor in the book but becomes a major supporting role as the obsessive character always looking for an infraction of theme park rules.  Oscar winner Anjelica Houston who was great inMedium - The Fourth Seasonplays Ida Mancini, a mentally disturbed woman who now deteriorates into dementia.  Her relationship with her son Victor is touchingly pathetic.  Victor is a strange man.  He's played superlatively by Sam Rockwell who I loved in the cult classicLawn Dogsand also appeared in ""Snow Angels"" and more recently in ""Frost/Nixon.""  His penchant for trying to scam people out of money in restaurants by false sympathy generated from staged choking incidents is equal parts scary & strange.  He develops a love interest with Paige Marshall, a doctor at the nursing home where his mother resides.  Kelly Mac Donald plays the character with nutty charm.  MacDonald was nominated for a Golden Globe and Emmy for her role in ""The Girl in the Cafe"" & was also nominated for a British Academy Award for her role in ""No Country for Old Men.""  The triangle between Huston, Rockwell & MacDonald carries the film.  Brad Henke from ""The Amateurs"" & ""The Zodiac"" plays Denny, Victor's best buddy.  Denny seems as off balance as the institutionalized with his plan to build a rock house.  Gillian Jacobs plays his girlfriend Beth who he meets at a club where she disrobes.

Choke, I think, was written to appeal to the masses. He still has his off-color and cult-style appeal going for him, but it surrounds a tale so overtly moralistic and (at the same time) moralistically ambivalent that it leaves little to no impression.""I watched the film because (as may be evident) I'm a glutton for Palahniuk (and Rockewell), but I have to confess, I remember the book only in snippets.  But even the parts I remembered seem here so sterilized and pointless that what little I liked about the book (namely, Chuck's acerbic and flippant style) is barely represented.Victor (Sam Rockwell) is a sex addict who ... well, who has struggles.  Hence the term ""sex addict.""  I am hard-pressed to imagine ANY kind of narrative about a sex addict that wouldn't encompass, on some level, the issues brought up by this movie/book.  Honor, love, childhood, personal value, purpose.  The unfortunate thing is that, what I remember working in the book is not (or hardly) represented by this movie.  Other than Rockwell's usually solid performance (and a few editorial choices) the movie is as forgettable as the book.  A quick trick, no great shakes, although you'll probably miss the money a day or so after spending it.And you'll most certainly wonder, like I did, what the whole point was.  The book, at least on this score, has more coherence.  The movie, on the other hand, drops entire chunks of sub-plot in order to make room for a few more boob shots.

Much like Fight Club the novel and film when compared to Choke the novel and film (for me personally), Choke doesn't quite pack the punch that Fight Club did, but it still leaves an undeniable mark.  Sam Rockwell stars as Victor Mancini, a sex-addict and con man who frequently visits his increasingly mentally-ill mother (Anjelica Huston) and works in a colonial theme park.  His playing on other's sympathies takes a bit of a turn when he learns new facets of his past, including a divine right of birth.  Director/screenwriter/co-star Clark Gregg manages to nail Palahniuk's wicked sense of satire and dark humor down pat, and although there are elements of the novel that get lost in translation in this film adaptation, Choke still manages to work.  Rockwell is perfect as Victor, and Kelly MacDonald is delightfully fluffy as Victor's mother's doctor who seems to hold the answers.

On the theme park side, you have a repertory of actors who play up the juvenile humor (think ""Waiting"" ""Employee of the Month"" ""40 year Old Virgin"" and any generic slacker generation comedies) and pit their will against their villainous superior, and then on the more ""serious"" side, you have the big names like Angelica Huston, Kelly MacDonald (Trainspotting, No Country For Old Men) handling the main actor's unique mother-son relationship, one where he attempts to reconstruct his childhood and possible lineage to Jesus Christ.It may very well be the intention on the filmmakers part to ping pong the two stories, thereby producing a jarring feeling between one constructed reality and another.  On the serious side, the story additionally jumps between flashbacks to the main character's childhood.  As a viewer, you obviously have to gauge your enjoyment of this film by how broad your viewing pleasure is.  If you like a wide range of genres, you may be able to make it through the movie.  But once the credits roll, you may shrug with a lukewarm feeling, squint and say to yourself like I (and most of my friends) did: ""Eh...I liked it and well, it was *okay*...""It has it's moments though.  Heather Burns (who played Nicole Kidman's mousy assistant in Bewitched) pulls a hilarious over-the-top cameo as the internet date from hell.  Her sexual fantasy involves a gigantic Bowie knife that is dwarfed only by her endless list of demands for her ideal role-playing condition.  Not only was it the funniest scene in the movie, it also integrates well into the notion of fabricated reality.What I was disappointed with was the beautiful moral of the story being overtly dispatched at the end of the movie by Victor.  Once that was uttered, everything in the movie made sense.  Of course, a more well-executed translation of Palahniuk's novel would have been able to bring that message to the surface without the need for those captions to be provided.

Like most of Palahniuk's work, I found ""Choke"" entertaining, if a little thin on character and story, and I feel the same about the film.  As a first-time director, Clark Gregg does a good job of translating the book to the screen, bringing it to life rather than just reenacting it.  The only time he somewhat falters is toward the end with two climactic scenes involving pudding and poo.  I was both surprised and disappointed that these scenes were kept intact.  They worked in the book, but even as I read them, I thought they would be too off-the-wall to work in a film, and I was right.  They just seemed odd and lacked the emotional punch that they had in the novel.""Fight Club"" is another of Palahniuk's books that I thought was merely enjoyable, but David Fincher pumped it full of style and energy, taking a decent book and turning it into an unforgettable film.  I can't help but wonder if ""Choke"" could have also been pushed to greatness if a more experienced director had handled the material.Bottom line: Chuck Palahniuk fans will be satisfied, but probably not blown away.

As Fight Club is about finding your way in a world without a proper father figure, Choke is about hiding away from a world dominated by a dysfunctional mother/son relationship. And like Fight Club, the humor is sadistic, cynical, and downright nasty. The book, by Chuck Palahnuik was ok, but i wasn't crazy about it, but the film is brilliant for one simple reason: Sam Rockwell. His portrayal of Vincent is spot on. Most of the jokes that would (and probably do) offend a lot of people are only tolerable because his delivery is perfect. The rape role-playing scene is the funniest thing EVER! What other film could you get away with a line like ""Why don't you shut the f@#k up and let me rape you my way!""?The ONLY reasons I did not give it five stars (what an arbitrary scoring method...)has do do with some piss-poor continuity (reference: forementioned mock-rape scene) and the rather ""lacking"" acting ability of the Doctor (I don't remember her name off hand).

It dwells on oddities to make the story unpredictable and spontaneous, instead of presenting eccentricities just for the sake of being weird. This darkly humorous work features outstanding performances by its clever cast, as well as some of the most perversely shocking and hilariously vulgar explanations of self destruction and redemption.To pay for an expensive hospital room for his mother, who can no longer even recognize her own son, Victor Mancini (Sam Rockwell) frequently pretends to choke during meals at expensive restaurants. Planning to be saved by the wealthiest patrons, he then parasitically feeds on their heroism and sympathies for the life they've saved. Conning his rescuers through letters and updates on his life (renewing the ""savior experience"" as he calls it), he continually receives money to use for his mother.While not pulling his scam, Victor works at a Colonial Williamsburg theme park (imagine the Renaissance Festival) where he portrays the backbone of America - an Irish indentured servant. Along with his best friend Denny (Brad William Henke) he also finds time to cruise sexual addiction recovery meetings looking for quick action. But when his mother Ida (Angelica Huston) slips deeper into derangement, he seeks out murky truths about his childhood with the help of the mysterious Dr. Paige Marshall (Kelly MacDonald).As Victor narrates his piteous existence, he's on a fast track to being the most unordinary of misfits; and yet he ends up being our antihero and the least of the insane. In the world of Choke, even the nuns are scum. Although a med-school dropout, a man with few morals and an insatiable lust for meaningless sex, Victor still manages to be a character to hail. Well-placed flashbacks give us insight on his unfavorably anomalistic childhood, as well as the purity and innocence that once existed in our now corrupted paladin.The narcissism and peculiarities of the characters in Choke account for its uniqueness and its dark, vulgar humor. Although its target audience might be slim, the success of Palahniuk's only other theatrically adapted story Fight Club might boost interests in this original and highly entertaining film. The similarities between the two are limited, aside from the quirky dialogue, deviant subject matter and the frequenting of rehabilitation workshops, but the idea that the most twisted minds can eventually produce sound satisfaction is a testament to these often morbid plotlines.- Mike Massie",4,Choke Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1222300800,"09 25, 2008",2008,2600,"['extreme', 'exploration', 'sexual', 'deviancy', 'compulsions', 'abnormalities', 'Choke', 'thought-provoking', 'challenging', 'oddities', 'make', 'story', 'unpredictable', 'spontaneous', 'instead', 'presenting', 'eccentricities', 'just', 'sake', 'being', 'weird', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'work', 'features', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'clever', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'perversely', 'shocking', 'hilariously', 'vulgar', 'explanations', 'self', 'destruction', 'redemption.To', 'pay', 'expensive', 'hospital', 'room', 'mother', 'who', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'even', 'recognize', 'own', 'son', 'Victor', 'Mancini', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'frequently', 'choke', 'meals', 'expensive', 'restaurants', 'Planning', 'be', 'saved', 'wealthiest', 'patrons', 'then', 'parasitically', 'feeds', 'heroism', 'sympathies', 'life', ""'ve"", 'saved', 'Conning', 'rescuers', 'letters', 'updates', 'life', 'renewing', 'savior', 'experience', 'continually', 'money', 'use', 'mother.While', 'not', 'pulling', 'scam', 'Victor', 'Colonial', 'Williamsburg', 'theme', 'park', 'imagine', 'Renaissance', 'Festival', 'where', 'backbone', 'America', 'Irish', 'indentured', 'servant', 'best', 'friend', 'Denny', 'Brad', 'William', 'Henke', 'also', 'time', 'cruise', 'sexual', 'addiction', 'recovery', 'meetings', 'looking', 'quick', 'action', 'when', 'mother', 'Ida', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'deeper', 'derangement', 'out', 'murky', 'truths', 'childhood', 'help', 'mysterious', 'Dr.', 'Paige', 'Marshall', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', '.As', 'Victor', 'piteous', 'existence', 'fast', 'track', 'being', 'most', 'unordinary', 'misfits', 'yet', 'up', 'being', 'antihero', 'least', 'insane', 'world', 'Choke', 'even', 'nuns', 'are', 'scum', 'med-school', 'dropout', 'man', 'few', 'morals', 'insatiable', 'lust', 'meaningless', 'sex', 'Victor', 'still', 'be', 'character', 'hail', 'Well-placed', 'flashbacks', 'give', 'insight', 'unfavorably', 'anomalistic', 'childhood', 'as', 'well', 'purity', 'innocence', 'once', 'existed', 'now', 'corrupted', 'paladin.The', 'narcissism', 'peculiarities', 'characters', 'Choke', 'account', 'uniqueness', 'dark', 'vulgar', 'humor', 'target', 'audience', 'might', 'be', 'slim', 'success', 'Palahniuk', 'only', 'other', 'theatrically', 'adapted', 'story', 'Fight', 'Club', 'might', 'boost', 'interests', 'original', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'similarities', 'two', 'are', 'limited', 'aside', 'quirky', 'dialogue', 'deviant', 'subject', 'matter', 'frequenting', 'rehabilitation', 'workshops', 'idea', 'most', 'twisted', 'minds', 'can', 'eventually', 'produce', 'sound', 'satisfaction', 'testament', 'often', 'plotlines.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A
