The acting alone should have made it a total Oscar winner.Marlon Brando is extraordinary in his subtle expresiveness as Sheriff Calder, well accompanied by Angie Dickinson as his loyal wife, both trapped in a small Texan hell-hole of a town where they expect to be saved by saving enough money from his lousy job to buy a farm away from it all.Jane Fonda is excellent as Anna Reeves, the slightly neurotic wife of the escaped prisioner, Bubber Reeves (Robert Redford) who has been having an affair with the town's spoilt brat and crown prince , Jason Rogers (James Fox) and heir to Val Rogers 's fortune (played excellently by E.G. Marshall), Robert Duvall is impressive in this early role as Edwin Stewart, an office drone that works for Val Rogers and is constantly humilated by his whorish wife, played to the hilt by Janice Rule.The dialogue in this movie is particularly good, perhaps because Lillian Hellman was the writer.An excellent essay in social criticism that was much needed at the time, as it is today. Had this movie been shown enough and talked about as much as it's inherent quality merits, perhaps we would not have chosen so many presidents from this unique environment.",5,Must-See.

385052,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6303686842,Austin Somlo,"[2, 5]","Viewed: 3/08Rate: 33/08: I spotted this little known DVD movie called The Chase in some five-dollar bargain bin, and I looked at the names of the cast: Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Robert Redford, Angie Dickinson, and Robert Duvall. Looking up the director of the film, it says Arthur Penn of Bonnie and Clyde and The Miracle Worker. Finally, peering further, Sam Spiegel produced The Chase. Now, I thought to myself that I must have scored a real bargain. So, I set out to watch the movie last night and began to fall asleep not very long after a half hour. By the time I finished the movie, I couldn't believe how boring and disconnected the film was. For all The Chase could offer, I finally pinpointed the major problem: too much star power. In other words, The Chase should have been Marlon Brando's film, and he was darned capable of carving a legendary performance out of his role. Instead, he is reduced as a tool, following a routine akin to what he did during On the Waterfront, but this time with no real sense of purpose or attachment. I know that the cast seems to be dazzling, but who are we kidding here? It's painfully obvious that Robert Redford is a pretty boy with acting ability resembling the depth of a shot glass. Jane Fonda has never been a good actress to start with, and she has been riding on the coattails of her famous father just like how Kiefer did with his dad. Before he would carve a niche for himself years later, Robert Duvall is far too young to make an impact on The Chase. I am not sure if I should be really disappointed with Arthur Penn, but considering the facts, The Chase was made in 1966, the year before Bonnie and Clyde would be made. Still, The Miracle Worker was made in 1962. Speaking of Bonnie and Clyde, Marlon Brando thought the fight scenes between himself and a gang of few residents were filmed at too high of camera speed. So, he instructed Arthur Penn to reduce the speed to make the fights look more artistically, therefore be better looking. That became a strong learning tool in forming a technique that would later be applied for the great scenes during Bonnie and Clyde. Then again, Marlon Brando was probably more pissed off in how his role was reduced and sorted out. In that case, he is right. The Chase failed to entertain me as it could have been cut to ninety minutes along with a reworking of the plot. All the film did was to make me to wait and wait for something happens. When it did, the climax wasn't surprising to me, and I actually predicted that Robert Redford's character would get killed. When he did, I immediately thought when the movie was made in, and The Chase is probably incredibly outdated today and now pointless. Even more laughable are the excellently choreographed fight scenes. Now, I haven't seen anything so fake since Rocky sequels. All in all, everybody wasted their time on The Chase, and unfortunately, I ended up paying the price.",2,Horribly Superficial and Weak.,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,2928,"['Viewed', '3/08Rate', '33/08', 'spotted', 'little', 'known', 'DVD', 'movie', 'called', 'Chase', 'five-dollar', 'bargain', 'bin', 'looked', 'names', 'cast', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Looking', 'up', 'director', 'film', 'Arthur', 'Penn', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Miracle', 'Worker', 'Finally', 'peering', 'further', 'Sam', 'Spiegel', 'produced', 'Chase', 'Now', 'thought', 'myself', 'must', 'have', 'scored', 'real', 'bargain', 'So', 'set', 'out', 'watch', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'began', 'fall', 'asleep', 'not', 'very', 'long', 'half', 'hour', 'time', 'finished', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'boring', 'disconnected', 'film', 'was', 'Chase', 'could', 'offer', 'finally', 'pinpointed', 'major', 'problem', 'too', 'much', 'star', 'power', 'other', 'words', 'Chase', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'film', 'was', 'darned', 'capable', 'carving', 'legendary', 'performance', 'role', 'Instead', 'reduced', 'tool', 'following', 'routine', 'akin', 'what', 'did', 'Waterfront', 'time', 'real', 'sense', 'purpose', 'attachment', 'know', 'cast', 'be', 'dazzling', 'who', 'are', 'kidding', 'here', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'pretty', 'boy', 'acting', 'ability', 'resembling', 'depth', 'shot', 'glass', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'never', 'been', 'good', 'actress', 'start', 'been', 'riding', 'coattails', 'famous', 'father', 'just', 'how', 'Kiefer', 'did', 'dad', 'would', 'carve', 'niche', 'years', 'later', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'make', 'impact', 'Chase', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'should', 'be', 'really', 'disappointed', 'Arthur', 'Penn', 'considering', 'facts', 'Chase', 'was', 'made', '1966', 'year', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'Still', 'Miracle', 'Worker', 'was', 'made', '1962', 'Speaking', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'thought', 'fight', 'scenes', 'gang', 'few', 'residents', 'were', 'filmed', 'too', 'high', 'camera', 'speed', 'So', 'instructed', 'Arthur', 'Penn', 'reduce', 'speed', 'make', 'fights', 'look', 'more', 'artistically', 'therefore', 'be', 'better', 'looking', 'became', 'strong', 'learning', 'tool', 'forming', 'technique', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'applied', 'great', 'scenes', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Then', 'again', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'pissed', 'off', 'how', 'role', 'was', 'reduced', 'sorted', 'out', 'case', 'right', 'Chase', 'failed', 'entertain', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'reworking', 'plot', 'film', 'did', 'was', 'make', 'wait', 'wait', 'something', 'happens', 'When', 'did', 'climax', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'actually', 'predicted', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'character', 'would', 'get', 'killed', 'When', 'did', 'immediately', 'thought', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Chase', 'probably', 'incredibly', 'outdated', 'today', 'now', 'pointless', 'Even', 'more', 'laughable', 'are', 'excellently', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Now', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'so', 'fake', 'Rocky', 'sequels', 'everybody', 'wasted', 'time', 'Chase', 'unfortunately', 'ended', 'up', 'paying', 'price']",Chase VHS

The Chase is a great film, but it has a flaw.For most of the filming, Redford/Bubber was distant from the other actors and production. Most of his scenes involved shooting on location showing him running through the swamps and marshes making his way back to his hometown after the prison break. This distance of his character, since he is such a centerpiece of speculation and turmoil for the other cast members, creates a distance from the film's story to the audience. To to make this story work, it needed to be told in a non-linear fashion. The audience needed to see flash-backs to when Bubber Reeves was in town and what led up to his frame up for murder and arrest. The audience needed to see and feel a real connection to Bubber and his history with the other characters.Never-the-less, flawed greatness is still great.

385054,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,6303686842,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[6, 10]","About an hour and a half into the film, the story starts. ""A breathless, explosive story?"" This movie doesn't explode, it implodes.For all it's stars and legendary talent -- Sam Spiegel producing, Lillian Hellman writing, Arthur Penn directing, John Barry score -- The Chase is an incoherent mess, and the problem is in the script, which goes off in way too many directions at once. All the great talent and money are there on the screen, but it doesn't gel. Somehow the strong auteur vision is missing. And the liberal themes come across as cliched and phony.The ""meaningful"" exposition about the escaped ""Bubba"" character (Redford) happens in dialogue, not through action, which is among the most burdensome aspects of this movie -- a royal disconnect between action and dialogue. The story takes place in Texas but is mostly shot on the studio backlots. Every one of the mainstream Hollywood actors has to affect a Texas accent, to varying degrees of failure. Every one of them is miscast, starting, of course, with Redford, who is too handsome to ever escape prison successfully. Brando does a fine job as the sheriff, but still the script doesn't give him free reign to be at his best.And who hired John Barry to score this movie? It's not just the Texas story, which calls for some country flavor which Barry cannot deliver. I am a huge fan of John Barry, but a John Barry score with Redford or Brando on the screen is just plain WRONG.There are too many characters, too many story lines to follow. The writer overloads us with too much material, and as a result we never get to focus on one or even two people for more than 4 minutes at a stretch.I conclude that the legendary producer Sam Spiegel, fresh off his monumentally successful project, Lawrence of Arabia, felt he could do no wrong. As such, he tried to make The Chase into an epic, when it would have better been executed on a smaller and more intimate scale.But if you want to see Robert Redford just prior to his home run performance in Butch Cassidy, see this film. If you want to see Arthur Penn fail as a director just before he made Bonnie and Clyde, see this film. If you want to hear a lousy John Barry score just after he worked on Goldfinger and Thunderball, see this film. If you want to see Jane Fonda just before she and Redford became famous in Barefoot in the Park, see this film. If you want to see Brit James Fox try to play a Texas oilman, see this film.  If you want to see Brando and Duvall before they made a good film together (The Godfather), see this film.""I'm telling you Spiegel, it can't miss!""

385055,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6303686842,David Baldwin,"[7, 7]","""The Chase"" is a letdown only if you consider the starpower in front of and behind the camera.  If I'm not mistaken, there was notorious wrangling behind the scenes between director Arthur Penn, scriptwriter Lillian Hellman, and producer Sam Spiegel.  Usually when you have that kind of backstage melodrama the result on the screen is a mess of a film.  That's not the case with ""The Chase"".  The film deliberately takes it's time establishing the psychological make-up of the small sleepy town.  Inject into that the word that the town's least favorite son has escaped from the pen and fireworks erupt.  The lead up to the explosive finale is thrilling but lacks the resonance to make ""The Chase"" a classic film.  See the film for the terrific performances not the least from star Marlon Brando in a laidback performance that isn't the least bit method as the town sheriff trying to keep the cork on the potential exploding powderkeg.  Robert Redford as the escaped con and Jane Fonda as his cheating spouse give performances to suggest the better things to come.

Well so far... this hasn't been remade yet. However, there is a movie similar to this one, and that's the Miramax teen porn movie ""Kids"". The plots seem similar in the sense that everyone feels that they're indestructable, and that they don't have to answer to anyone. Now that I've gotten that out of the way back to my original statement. If there had to be a remake of this movie I'd make it even more darker than the 1966 version. Mind you not to where there was gore, and demons chasing people around, but where there was total lawlessness in this small town. For starters have the sherrif's wife killed, or so it seems by the vigilante townsmen right alongside with the black man, then where Bubber gets killed when the townsmen start to assult the sherrif have the sherrif kill all 3 townsmen who started the trouble in the first place. Then have the sherrif rip the clothes off the one party hearty woman, and kidnap her to the local motel, and break her spirit. Don't show the real hardcore rape of her, but give the implications that she's been seriously violated, and then have the sherrif go through the town branding his own version of justice as the fires are going have him shoot and kill some of the teenagers who saw the adults causing trouble, so they figured...well we can do this too, and the other party hearty girl hack her long hair off with a machete. Then bring in the surprise where the sherrif's wife is not dead, but just wounded, but enough to where she can go, and try to calm down her husband. The finale have it where the sherrif is found guilty...but mentally ill, and have committed to a insane asylum. Never again to be a sherrif. The ending keep it as is because it had a strong moment of where the mayor laments over what happened with Bubber's wife. Mind you this is a little more graphic, and they may have to give it a NC-21 rating, but like I said don't put the graphic sex scene in the movie. Have it where the woman is trying to calm down the sherrif, and then when the sherrif makes a grab for her fast cut to the outside of the motel with the woman making a blood-curdling scream...with some heavy loud music. Then cut back into the room with it almost pitch-black, and here have some cymbal and maybe some gong playing as you show the woman crying softly in the background, and the sherrif going through his transformation. The songs for this segment I would recommend ""L America"" from the Doors, and ""Genesis"" from Tangerine Dream. Another song I'd recommend where the sherrif hacks off the long hair with the machete ""Golden Glass"" from The Misunderstood. Finally at the end with the closing credits ""Ghetto Nation"" from Warrior Soul. Dark enough for you all? Well I found the 66 version to be rather graphic, and not for the innocent.

The obvious massive gap between the rich - the world of Val Rogers played by the great E.G. Marshall - and the poor such as the Mexican cheap labour, the African-Americans - is manifest. But the image of a very big American automobile - known in Australia as a Yank tank - driving down the dirt road of the centre of this southern town by the son of the richest man in town, reveals the problem facing the USA where private wealth lives and plays among public squalor so tellingly pointed up and studied by Mr Galbraith in his book The Affluent Society. Indeed, it's no stretch to suggest that the seeds of the American demise, or at least, the waning of the American Empire, is everywhere evident in this fine film.

385061,AVF60NZ99H9D5,6303686842,Kirk Alex,"[23, 29]","I realize I gave this flick 4 stars--but I also have to say that Brando gets the highest rating of 5 stars. This film could have been greater than it was...and it just may bother you for that reason. One of my problems is that it was shot on some studio backlot (probably Universal, as the set looks a lot like the set used for Back to the Future) the other weakness is Robert Redford. You want to see how great Brando was in everything he did? Just try to compare what he does with what others do? Your eyes are always drawn to him, no matter who else is in the scene with the guy--and this film had an all-star cast, too......The other thing that bugged me about this picture is just this: could a punk breaking out of prison (as does the Redford character in the film) by the name of &quot;Bubber&quot; Reeves (who ends up being falsely accused of murder) cause so much turmoil and havoc in a redneck town like this? (Blame it on the screenwriters... Never read the novel the movie was based on, so can't comment on that aspect of it.)My other complaint is also with the director, Arthur Penn. Someone else should have directed this thing--don't ask who, maybe someone like Kazan (who reportedly turned it down).First saw this thing in the sixties in Chicago as a teen, and the damn picture, or rather the Brando character stayed with me all these years. He plays a decent man trying to do the right thing in a rinky-dink redneck Texas town, does his best to protect the Reeves character from the moronic townsfolk who are eager to &quot;lynch&quot; him without a trial even.Checked the DVD out the night BEFORE Brando passed away, not sure why, just to see if the flick had withstood the test of time. Well, as you know, Brando passed on the very next day...and it left me, as it did so many others, plenty bummed out. I doubt we'll ever see another like him. So many actors try to duplicate what he did (and so often it is in your face obvious and pathetic) and all it does is makes you ache for the original (in order to take a second look at what the real thing was like.) This is why I had rented the DVD, as well as others over the years with Brando, because most actors don't even come close.Anyway, I gave The Chase four stars, felt about it as I did back in the 60's: Brando great, but the telling of the tale troubling ( maybe over the top/over-produced; too much plot for what should have remained a far simpler story).I'll say it again: should have never been made on fake studio sets. The writers tried to do too much with too many characters, etc. Probably would have worked better had it been shot in black and white, the way they did with The Last Picture Show (and they would have had a better movie than the vastly overrated Last Picture Show.)See it for Brando as Sheriff Calder.

385072,ANF5BP1SD3Z3O,6303686842,"Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01","[5, 7]","I really liked this movie.  Brando's performance is riveting.  His performance is layered and compelling and he gives depth to Sheriff Calder.  There are also suprisingly modern themes of adultery hints of swinging, drinking, racism, violence and classism with respect to justice in this drama.You know the casting is a bit of a stretch.  You know that no Texas/southern town has this many great looking people wandering around.  Brando acting is always a cut above and because of his abilities you believe him as a real small town sheriff.  Despite his looks he loses himself in the role.In some ways this movie seems dated because of the dialogue of the female characters and music more than anything.  Angie Dickinson's dialogue is just plain stupid at times.  Especially when Calder rescues a Black man from some drunken racists and he places him in custody for his own protection.  Calder is clearly disgusted by the behavior of the racist group of men and he sits down in his office and tells his wife Ruby how fed up he is with the town and the situation; Brando is clearly making a creative choice and giving her a lot of emotion as an actor.  I believe Ruby responds by getting a dreamy blank look on her face and saying ""I wish we had adopted some children."" This makes me question Dickinson's creative choice as an actress.  But Brando's character gives her a surprised look before responding; that moment is funny and priceless because you wonder if the surpise is coming from the character or the actor.It seems as if the writer did not know how to write something meaningful for a woman to say when faced with her husband's frustration over injustice.  The only female character with any depth is Jane Fonda's and she does a good job with the role of Anna.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of some of the dialogue and the casting.  In some ways with Brando they should have cast better supporting actors - in some scenes he just blows the others away and it is hard to focus on the story if he is in a scene with someone who can't keep up with him.Look for his sister Jocelyn in the role of Mrs. Biggs.",4,Edgy and surprising.,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,2135,"['really', 'liked', 'movie', 'Brando', 'performance', 'riveting', 'performance', 'layered', 'compelling', 'depth', 'Sheriff', 'Calder', 'are', 'also', 'suprisingly', 'modern', 'themes', 'adultery', 'hints', 'swinging', 'drinking', 'racism', 'violence', 'classism', 'respect', 'justice', 'drama.You', 'know', 'casting', 'bit', 'stretch', 'know', 'Texas/southern', 'town', 'many', 'great', 'looking', 'people', 'wandering', 'around', 'Brando', 'acting', 'always', 'cut', 'abilities', 'believe', 'real', 'small', 'town', 'sheriff', 'role.In', 'ways', 'movie', 'dated', 'dialogue', 'female', 'characters', 'music', 'more', 'anything', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'dialogue', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'times', 'Especially', 'when', 'Calder', 'Black', 'man', 'drunken', 'racists', 'custody', 'own', 'protection', 'Calder', 'clearly', 'disgusted', 'behavior', 'racist', 'group', 'men', 'down', 'office', 'wife', 'Ruby', 'how', 'fed', 'up', 'town', 'situation', 'Brando', 'clearly', 'making', 'creative', 'choice', 'giving', 'lot', 'emotion', 'actor', 'believe', 'Ruby', 'responds', 'getting', 'dreamy', 'blank', 'look', 'face', 'saying', 'wish', 'had', 'adopted', 'children', 'question', 'Dickinson', 'creative', 'choice', 'actress', 'Brando', 'character', 'surprised', 'look', 'responding', 'moment', 'funny', 'priceless', 'wonder', 'surpise', 'coming', 'character', 'actor.It', 'writer', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'write', 'something', 'meaningful', 'woman', 'say', 'when', 'faced', 'husband', 'frustration', 'injustice', 'only', 'female', 'character', 'depth', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'Anna.The', 'only', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'dialogue', 'casting', 'ways', 'Brando', 'should', 'have', 'cast', 'better', 'supporting', 'actors', 'scenes', 'just', 'others', 'away', 'hard', 'focus', 'story', 'scene', 'someone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'him.Look', 'sister', 'Jocelyn', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'Biggs']",Chase VHS

Set in Texas in the post war era,Horton Footes novel laid a good foundation for this film,updated to the 60's. I read the book,fully expecting to excoriate Ms. Hellman for her work,but I must say she did a fine job of turning a dour and sad story and making it a compelling story about the nature of man under the pressure of his own cconscience.This film suffers only from two problems,the low budget,forcing studio lot shooting,and the excessive editing at the insistence of the studio heads who feared fanning the flames of the civial unrest we suffered in the mid 60s. The result is,as Mr. Penn lamented,that a fine film ended up on the cutting room floor.The product we are left with is a timeless look into the heart of man,bless Lillians commie soul.Get it.

385077,A2KNX6Y72E1FVJ,6303686842,"V. Risoli ""black farmer""","[2, 2]","Sam Spiegel's film of Horton Foote's 1952 play ""The Chase"" was very much anticipated in 1966 when it was released as it boasted a script by Lillian Hellman and starred Marlon Brando in addition to Jane Fonda, Robert Redford, E.G. Marhsall, James Fox, Angie Dickinson, Janice Rule, Miriam Hopkins, Martha Hyer, Robert Duvall, Richard Bradford and many other notables including everyone's favorite (mature) teen-ager, Paul Williams.  Spiegel had just produced David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (who must really take credit for that film's ultimate triumph, but for ""The Chase"" Spiegel had Arthur Penn directing who still had not proven himself having directed ""The Miracle Worker"", but his work on ""Mickey One"" was critically applauded but misunderstood and ""Bonnie and Clyde"" with Warren Beatty was still to come.  Because there was a chance for failure, I understood the film's final cut was by the studio.  It may not be the best John Barry score, but I think it still needs to be given a chance.  It barely intrudes on the narrative, which, as written by Hellman, draws on some powerful emotions of hate, disgust and all the potential of the human spirit to bring itself down to the devil's dues.  There is a long excerpt from Barry's score at the end of the film as exit music that should be available on CD as it needs to heard repeatedly than after seeing the entire film and then being graced with the themes.  I did not see the ending coming, although the character of ""Bubba"" (Redford) sees ""his own end"" from the very beginning actually, although I think some of the acting is so ""to the hilt"" like Janice Rule and Martha Hyer, it becomes melodramatic (especially Miriam Hopkins, who has appeared in some role in every film version of Hellman's ""The Children's Hour"").  Redford, Fonda and Fox provide an admiral trio, it's too bad they were given more of the emphasis than the townspeople.  But then, it is really Brando's picture and his upright and disillusioned sheriff, overcome by lawlessness in the townsfolk ignites the screen with a power, and bravura acting including Dickinson, that adds a complementary balance to the film's message.  Arthur Penn soon after became something of an auteur in less than a year with ""Bonnie and Clyde"" receiving another AAN (he had received one for ""The Miracle Worker"") and then again for ""Alice's Restaurant.""  Sam Spiegel lined up another fabulous cast in also 1967 for ""The Happening"" (not released on home video) starring Anthony Quinn, Michael Parks, George Maharis, Robert Walker, Jr., Faye Dunaway, Martha Hyer, Oscar Homolka and Milton Berle directed by Elliot Silverstein (Cat Ballou"").  That had the great theme song sung by the Supremes.  Now, more than ever, needs a DVD release.
