I saw it years ago when it was on TV but I've never until now been able to get a copy of it. I forgot what a great story it it, you know. The wife who is married to the successful psychiatrist who is gone a lot on work projects. She meets this lonely sailor who is in port and they innocently fall into this relationship. One thing leads to another and as usual someone gets hurt. Mark Dominic (Sean Garrison's character) gets hurt in more ways than one. It's one of those delightful 1970 movies shot in France with this beautiful country side. The lovely melody written by Henry Mancini with lyrics by Johnny Mercer plays in the background. It's unfortunate that the people selling even the used copies of the DVD on amazon.com want so much for it. Look around on the internet, I'm sure you can find it for less than what they want.

I was only 11 years old when I saw it. But the impression it left was--I would love to live a life like that.

Arthur Hill played the typical ""husband"".  Always like Hill too. A real classy, modern lovetriangle.  I sound flip, but I really enjoyed this film.

56042,A1WTHRVF9UUN0R,0783226233,Oliver Penn,"[21, 22]","What an incredible theme song this lovely picture has.  Henry Mancini, along with other major composers, wrote some of the best movie themes during this era (50s &amp; 60s).  Also, during that era, songs that went on to get nominated for Oscars were first rate - unlike today's non-descript dreck.&quot;Moment to Moment&quot; is a lovely movie.  I loved the scene at the cafe when the white doves flew up into the sun (turning golden) to say &quot;goodbye to the day.&quot;  That glorious theme music crept in all through the picture, making the mood extra special.I recently bought a Mancini CD just to get the theme from this film.  Jean Seberg was a beautiful actress with perfect looks which matched the astonishingly handsome, Sean Garrison, playing the man she cheats with and believes she's killed.I could see Lana Turner playing this role, it was her kind of picture, but Seberg was just fine.  I'm just disappointed that I can't have this on DVD with possible &quot;extras&quot; of outakes, interviews, etc., especially with Mancini who created this impassioned music.  The music theme set the entire mood for the movie.

Mark Dominic (Sean Garrison) loves to sketch, he wants to become an architect, and the area is too beautiful to pass up. Kay gives him a ride to a tower he wanted a better look at, but they get side tracked along the way and enjoy lunch together. Kay is hesitant because her husband (Arthur Hill) is away, but she indulges in a few dates with Mark. One night, things go too far, and the only person Kay can trust is her kooky neighbor next door (Honor Blackman).Moment to Moment is a glorified soap opera complete with hazy photography, beautiful people, and silly situations, but I liked it in spite of myself. The melodramatic story is gripping, even though you can guess what is going to happen. There are hints planted everywhere. All of the actors give good performances, but Seberg and Blackman are the most enjoyable.

56044,A14ADG0TTI4XBV,0783226233,"Scott Coblio ""kookoo guy""","[3, 4]","""Moment to Moment"" is a movie that  screams for edgier writing & direction. Brought to you by Mervyn LeRoy (Wizard of Oz), the plot has Hitchcock written all over it:  A ""good"" woman whose husband is frequently away on business is driven by loneliness to have an adulterous affair, during which she accidentally shoots her temporary paramour --then hides his body with the help of her nosy neighbor, trying all the while to conceal her ""crime"" from investigators and ultimately from her husband and son. ""Moment to Moment"" could have been a wickedly funny, suspenseful and clever concoction in the ""Rear Window"" vein.But the comic as well as the dramatic possibilities of the premise are apparently lost on LeRoy, who seems so bent on delivering a product which can offend no one, that he inadvertently heads off all the most interesting possibilities at the pass. The most obvious casualty is Seberg's performance in the lead role. Over-coiffed and over-coutured, she sleepwalks through a series of pastel scenes with a tight-lipped and fixed expression that recalls Jessica Lang's lobotomized Frances Farmer in the last scenes of ""Frances"". Under LeRoy's direction, Seberg--magical in her best films-- is an attractive but drab presence here.When Tippi Hedren or Grace Kelly played cool society blondes-in-a-jam, they seasoned their placid characterizations with the suggestion of inner turmoils, hidden agendas, By contrast, Seberg is all surface here, completely lacking the inner fire apparent in her earlier work. Where is the Tinkerbellish, dimpled pixie of ""Breathless"", the feline duplicity of ""Bonjour Tristesse"" or the lurking malevolence of ""Lilith""?  Here she is merely pretty, a decorative ornament in a movie full of decorative ornaments.What Hitchcock could have provided, and which the movie sorely needs, is one of two things: a) a more complex character (either written or suggested), or a scene in which Seberg's character completely unravels. This would have given a seeming point to her flatness elsewhere in the film.  It's a cinematic axiom that characters this quick-frozen  must at some point in the plot be melted--undone, deconstructed, ravaged. ""Moment"" ignores this axiom,  and suffers all the more for it.Only Honor Blackman is vivid as comic relief in a secondary role as Seberg's nosy neighbor and partner-in-crime,  offering the film's only indelible character. Blackman, at least, is willing to go out on a limb in a movie which takes no risks, easily stealing the show from both her co-stars and the plot in which they flounder.",2,Snoozy Suspense Drama Cries Out for Hitchcock's Touch,1213228800,"06 12, 2008",2008,2564,"['Moment', 'Moment', 'movie', 'edgier', 'writing', 'direction', 'Brought', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'plot', 'Hitchcock', 'written', 'good', 'woman', 'husband', 'frequently', 'away', 'business', 'driven', 'loneliness', 'have', 'adulterous', 'affair', 'accidentally', 'shoots', 'temporary', 'paramour', 'then', 'body', 'help', 'nosy', 'neighbor', 'trying', 'while', 'conceal', 'crime', 'investigators', 'ultimately', 'husband', 'son', 'Moment', 'Moment', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'suspenseful', 'clever', 'concoction', 'Rear', 'Window', 'comic', 'as', 'well', 'dramatic', 'possibilities', 'premise', 'are', 'apparently', 'lost', 'LeRoy', 'who', 'so', 'bent', 'delivering', 'product', 'can', 'offend', 'one', 'inadvertently', 'most', 'interesting', 'possibilities', 'pass', 'most', 'obvious', 'casualty', 'Seberg', 'performance', 'lead', 'role', 'Over-coiffed', 'over-coutured', 'sleepwalks', 'series', 'pastel', 'scenes', 'tight-lipped', 'fixed', 'expression', 'Jessica', 'Lang', 'lobotomized', 'Frances', 'Farmer', 'last', 'scenes', 'Frances', 'LeRoy', 'direction', 'Seberg', 'magical', 'best', 'films', 'attractive', 'drab', 'presence', 'here.When', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'played', 'cool', 'society', 'blondes-in-a-jam', 'seasoned', 'placid', 'characterizations', 'suggestion', 'inner', 'turmoils', 'hidden', 'agendas', 'contrast', 'Seberg', 'surface', 'here', 'completely', 'lacking', 'inner', 'fire', 'apparent', 'earlier', 'work', 'Where', 'Tinkerbellish', 'dimpled', 'pixie', 'Breathless', 'feline', 'duplicity', 'Bonjour', 'Tristesse', 'lurking', 'malevolence', 'Lilith', 'Here', 'merely', 'pretty', 'decorative', 'ornament', 'movie', 'full', 'decorative', 'Hitchcock', 'could', 'have', 'provided', 'movie', 'sorely', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'written', 'suggested', 'scene', 'Seberg', 'character', 'completely', 'unravels', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'seeming', 'point', 'flatness', 'elsewhere', 'film', 'cinematic', 'axiom', 'characters', 'quick-frozen', 'must', 'point', 'plot', 'be', 'melted', 'undone', 'deconstructed', 'ravaged', 'Moment', 'axiom', 'suffers', 'more', 'it.Only', 'Honor', 'Blackman', 'vivid', 'comic', 'relief', 'secondary', 'role', 'Seberg', 'nosy', 'neighbor', 'partner-in-crime', 'offering', 'film', 'only', 'indelible', 'character', 'Blackman', 'least', 'willing', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'movie', 'risks', 'easily', 'stealing', 'show', 'co-stars', 'plot', 'flounder']",N/A
