The film is such  a perfect metaphor for life in an urban american city.What makes this  film even more remarkable, is that it's all true. And not one of those  washed out 'based on fact' movies. On The Ropes is a feature documentary  about real people fighting real battles in and out of the boxing ring, and  its production style is gritty, entangled and subsequently perfect, for the  metaphor continues...the lives of the people it documents is gritty and  entangled and complex.I highly recommend this film for viewing. If  you're a boxing fan, you HAVE to see it, and if you are interested in real  life drama, you have to see it.",5,The inside look from outside the ring...,953164800,"03 16, 2000",2000,842,"['Ropes', 'boxing', '.not', 'pro', 'boxing', 'where', 'everyone', 'money', 'young-people', 'boxing', 'urban', 'NY', 'where', 'fight', 'lives', 'struggle', 'break', 'quot', 'quot', 'ring', 'film', 'perfect', 'metaphor', 'life', 'urban', 'american', 'city.What', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'remarkable', 'true', 'not', 'one', 'washed', 'out', ""'based"", 'fact', 'movies', 'Ropes', 'feature', 'documentary', 'real', 'people', 'fighting', 'real', 'battles', 'boxing', 'ring', 'production', 'style', 'gritty', 'entangled', 'subsequently', 'perfect', 'metaphor', 'lives', 'people', 'documents', 'gritty', 'entangled', 'complex.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'viewing', ""'re"", 'boxing', 'fan', 'HAVE', 'see', 'are', 'interested', 'real', 'life', 'drama', 'have', 'see']",N/A

When I see what these kids did and will do for their hobbie. I feel vain and ashamed.&quot;On The Ropes&quot; follows a coach and three boxers to fighting  in the golden glove tournament. Along the way they face the reality of  their enviorment( The Bronx), their own identities and events around them  they can't control.

The film shows how success is a constant goal for the young boxers, but also how failure loss and betrayal  haunt every move they make. Each of the four is tough enough to train and  fight hard, get knocked down, and then get back up again. Each of them,  however, has been wounded by circumstances to the point that every  achievement is clouded by fear that everything will be taken away from  them. It is the best of several new documentaries I have seen recently.",5,Great documentary about hard work and haunted lives.,957139200,"05 1, 2000",2000,575,"['quot', 'Ropes', 'quot', 'documentary', 'three', 'boxers', 'trainer', 'poor', 'city', 'neighborhood', 'film', 'how', 'success', 'constant', 'goal', 'young', 'boxers', 'also', 'how', 'failure', 'loss', 'betrayal', 'haunt', 'move', 'make', 'four', 'tough', 'enough', 'train', 'fight', 'hard', 'get', 'knocked', 'down', 'then', 'get', 'back', 'up', 'again', 'however', 'been', 'wounded', 'circumstances', 'point', 'achievement', 'clouded', 'fear', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'best', 'several', 'new', 'documentaries', 'have', 'seen', 'recently']",N/A

It's shown very clearly that their lives outside of the ring are tougher than any boxing match one can imagine.

Harry got George started as a boxer. But George, the most-talented of the three fighters, caught the eye of a successful manager. The manager begins moving George away from Harry in order to push him toward the ""big time."" The viewer feels for Harry, who seems to be a decent person.The other two boxers are Tyrene and Noel. Tyrene is a young woman who shows promise in the ring.  But she must resolve drug charges before she can focus on boxing. Noel is uninteresting; he is inarticulate and shows little talent for boxing.On the Ropes leaves the viewer dissatisfied. The film tells the beginning and middle of each boxer's story, but we never see the end.
