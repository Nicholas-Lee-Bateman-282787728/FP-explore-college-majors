I had fewer problems with the choice of casting that many others here seemed to have because to me it wasn't really about the cast. Being a self-considered Lennon fan this was a little hard for me to watch and I had to ask myself if it was the human ability to want to elevate our heroes after they are gone. The nostalgia factor as it were.As another reviewer writes here, to me and what I know of John and his life, public and private, he was a complicated person, full of extremes. His talent and intelligence was unquestionable. His emotional side ran the gamete from nasty and very self-involved to very loving and giving of himself. He was, or acted like he was a little crazy. True artists, musicians and actors are often eccentric and self-absorbed. It seems go with the territory.We know from all the other media about his life that John was not perfect but I think like many of us, he strove to be... to give something back. He was VERY human, and his life, by choice as well as not, has been well documented on film (home movies as well as professional footage,) books and interviews of those that knew him best!So why would we need a semi-fictional biopic of this nature unless it had to do with money? Why was this film necessary for the director and producers to produce?Upon reflection, I wonder what the purpose really was in making this film? Was this made in search of a new artistic angle in which to view Lennon's life, or in search of money? Did the film makers have a contractual necessity to make it? Were they behind the 8-ball and had to produce something the BBC could promote? I have to keep asking myself, what was the intention?

The accent is over-the-top northern, he walks like a chimp bobbing dramatically from side to side, he has the physique of an overpumped college wrestler, and if his acting were any stiffer, it would shatter and litter the floor with a thousand pieces.  Sure Lennon was a salt-of-the-earth type of guy, yet you'd think you were watching a troglodyte when you see this bulging guy walk and talk and strain terribly every time he tries to think.  It's hopeless stuff.And the script...think of all the overtold Lennon stories and lines we already know, and they are here.Poor John, impersonated by an actor for whom subtlety is rocket science and finesse the name of a French salad.  When I think of the fine humor, the tastefulness, the wry irony, and the elegance in Lennon, I find it appalling to see how underprepared and unperceptive the people behind this movie were.  Here, Lennon strolls around like a dolt who is going through the shock of having his first idea.  Surely he deserves better.I have no beef with the flick presenting Lennon's nastier side, just don't rob people of their time with such lousy product.On the other hand, it may be worth a viewing just for the laughs...or the horror.",1,Turning In His Grave!

1376566,A29UI6C6ZVDAOH,B003YOZNCE,Christopher Ness,"[17, 24]","If you have fond feelings toward the memory of John Lennon, I would stay away from this film. It presents a pretty biased look at the final years of Lennon in the late 1960s presenting him as nothing but a radically depressed a-hole. Christopher Eccleston resembles a mid-1970s John Lennon & does a pretty good vocal impression. Im a fan of his and I wanted to like this production. Hes way too old to play the 23 year old Lennon we see in 1964 in the beginning. The Beatle wig looked silly on him. Naoko Mori is fine as Yoko. The guy who plays Paul does a good voice, but the Beatles other than Lennon dont resemble their real world counterparts, nor are they featured in much of this story. The entire tale dramatizes every depressing and negative thing that Lennon experienced/did during that era. Sure everyone can be depressed and everyone can be a cruel jerk once in a while, but thats almost all John Lennon is presented as here. What about all the fun, happy times which also fill our lives? Lennon is not permitted any. What of all the great music he created on the White Album, etc.? You wont see or hear anything about that here. Lennon left England because of the negative treatment he and Yoko received in the British press. The makers of this production seem to have never forgiven him for that and this film is their revenge.

For a long time, I couldn't see anything more than Eccleston in a wig. Looking really nothing like John didn't help matters either. Needless to say, that it took me right out of the film. However, Eccleston's ernest portrayal of John won me somewhat over by the end. The story itself is good and the acting is even better. I liked the idea of the movie since that is one topic the Lennon movies never really talk about. You really get to see the hurt Lennon you could only before really experience through his music. Kind of ironic that John hated his dad for abandoning him as a child and yet he did the same thing to his own son, Julian.

1376571,A4RGZIX3FVQ0Y,B003YOZNCE,Joyce,"[5, 9]","I agree with everyone who said the actor portraying John was much too old-looking to be him, especially in younger years.  The wig looked silly.  I did not think any of the actors looked like who they were supposed to be portraying, except perhaps for the woman who portrayed Yoko.  I also agree that John had made some bad choices in his life, and was not a perfect saint.  I also agree that he was someone who did much good in his life, or tried to.  He tried to learn from his mistakes and attempted to make amends for some of the things he did that were hurtful to others.  He did not get the chance to continue to do so, as he was judged and executed by a very sick individual who blamed John for all of his own inadequacies and abuses by others.  He became John's judge and jury, and sentenced him to death, for being human, like the rest of us.  He robbed John of his chance to try and make things right, and he robbed John's children of their father, Yoko of her partner (no matter what the truth of their relationship was), and the world of a complicated, interesting, and extremely gifted artist who never claimed to be a perfect role model to anyone.  I fault this movie for not being balanced in it's portrayal of it's subject.  It shows perhaps some of the why's of his actions/reactions, but does not show anything positive that he did or tried to do.  There are many movies that just show John as this sainted talented musician, which is also not true.  He was many things.  These movies are not accurate, but neither is this portrayal of him, as someone who was injured as a child, and so became an unpleasant person who had no positive attributes of his own.  I believe John was so hard on himself about all of the mistakes he made; do we need to be hard on him also?  Haven't all of us done things that were not right; hurting others who were innocent because we were hurting ourselves, losing our patience and taking things out on whoever was near, etc.  Why is John judged on a so much higher level than the rest of us?  Why can't we accept him for who he was, instead of holding him to impossibly high standards that are impossible to achieve?  He never claimed to be perfect, he was just a human being who loved music, and tried to survive the crazy existence of living as a famous person in our society.  He did the best he could with the life experiences he was given, as we all try to do.  He produced some of the most beautiful music ever created for all of us to enjoy, while he was in the process of trying to live his life.  Why must he be only one extreme or another?  This movie is not a fair, definitive portrayal of John.  It is just another one-dimensional portrayal of a human being, who happened to be famous.  Who is he, really?  He is John.  Simply, John.

1376573,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003YOZNCE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[21, 24]","There is so much biographical material on The Beatles and John Lennon, I was curious to see what angle the BBC's ""Lennon Naked"" might take.  A psychological portrait of loss and alienation form the crux of this film which presents the more negative aspects of a unique artist.  Charting a timeframe from 1964 to 1971, we see Lennon reconnect with an estranged father, become entangled with Yoko Ono, dismantle his marriage, disband The Beatles, take up political activism, and eventually leave Britain altogether.  As with most bio-pics, there is plenty of fact and plenty of invention.  I do think ""Lennon Naked"" portrays an interesting side to Lennon, but any historical background or context is rather rushed.  It probably helps to come into ""Lennon Naked"" with pre-existing knowledge of the events in questions.For me, the primary reason for watching ""Lennon Naked"" is Christopher Eccleston's uncompromising performance (even if he's a bit old at the outset).  Never does the screenplay try to endear us to Lennon or soften his edges.  I found that to be the most refreshing aspect of the picture.  Eccleston has literally and figuratively stripped down Lennon and presents us with a man very difficult to like, and in doing so has created something that feels very real.  Ultimately, though, your appreciation with ""Lennon Naked"" will be determined by your expectations.  There is surprisingly little actual biography--just snippets of a life lived.  This is a character piece in which Lennon systematically pushes everyone away from him with a standoffishness that is surprisingly candid.  It is the self-indulgent artist versus the world, at least until Yoko shows up.  The film eventually tries to explain some of Lennon's emotional disconnect, which results in arguably the finest dramatic scene, but can be summed up rather tritely as ""daddy issues.""In truth, I didn't love ""Lennon Naked,"" but I did admire it.  There is no doubt that Lennon was a visionary and a genius, but this film barely hints at the talent that made him unique.  Without any real glimpse of the artistic Lennon, the unpleasantness of a man who continually alienates the most important people in his life can seem a bit one-note.  At 90 minutes, there's only so much this BBC production could cover--but it's so unrepentantly bleak.  I wanted more time to see a fully rounded Lennon.  As a psychological portrait, which is the primary goal of ""Lennon Naked,"" I ultimately wanted something more in-depth.  The emotional payoff didn't offer enough dividends for me and I ended up slightly disconnected from the film.

The casting is peculiar and some characters don't even begin to resemble the real persons, physically or otherwise. I found it positively painful looking at the actor cast as George Harrison. The voice and accent of the Paul McCartney sounds like the Saturday morning cartoon character and consequently his speech is not only unintelligible, but I wanted to laugh every time he opened his mouth. Yoko Ono is a gentler and far more beautiful version of actual self, and Cynthia Powell is a plain, strident harridan in a very bad 60s wig. Eccleston vaguely channels a semi-creditable Lennon in some of the scenes, which is difficult given his advanced age. But it's the story trajectory and its mile markers that are least understandable to a Lennon fan or follower. One doesn't understand why the film picks an arbitrary point in early Beatlemania to start and then ends upon his move to New York. The timing of some major events in the arbitrary window into his life is a little skewed, as well. Too many of the characters and too much of the screenplay and script seems manipulated to give the Lennon character an adversary and justification for behaving badly in the ""legendary"" fashion in every scene; the Freddie Lennon (father) character is the most egregiously manipulated of all the straw men.If it weren't for the authentic Lennon music (and a Yoko song, which might explain the pretty Yoko actress and the Lennon permissions being granted) and the interspersed clips of real events linking the filmed scenes, it would have indeed fallen apart completely.By the way, there are apparently two versions out there, a BBC and a PBS; the latter, which I purchased, has some pointless edits for foul language.I should have listened to the other reviewers who warned us to save our money.",2,Disappointment Incarnate,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,1852,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'most', 'decisions', 'made', 'film', 'casting', 'peculiar', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'resemble', 'real', 'persons', 'physically', 'otherwise', 'found', 'positively', 'painful', 'looking', 'actor', 'cast', 'George', 'Harrison', 'voice', 'accent', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'character', 'consequently', 'speech', 'not', 'only', 'unintelligible', 'wanted', 'laugh', 'time', 'opened', 'mouth', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'gentler', 'far', 'more', 'beautiful', 'version', 'actual', 'self', 'Cynthia', 'Powell', 'plain', 'strident', 'harridan', 'very', 'bad', '60s', 'wig', 'Eccleston', 'vaguely', 'semi-creditable', 'Lennon', 'scenes', 'difficult', 'given', 'advanced', 'age', 'story', 'trajectory', 'mile', 'markers', 'are', 'least', 'understandable', 'Lennon', 'fan', 'follower', 'One', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'arbitrary', 'point', 'early', 'Beatlemania', 'start', 'then', 'move', 'New', 'York', 'timing', 'major', 'events', 'arbitrary', 'window', 'life', 'little', 'skewed', 'as', 'well', 'Too', 'many', 'characters', 'too', 'much', 'screenplay', 'script', 'manipulated', 'give', 'Lennon', 'character', 'adversary', 'justification', 'behaving', 'badly', 'legendary', 'fashion', 'scene', 'Freddie', 'Lennon', 'father', 'character', 'most', 'egregiously', 'manipulated', 'straw', 'men.If', 'were', ""n't"", 'authentic', 'Lennon', 'music', 'Yoko', 'song', 'might', 'explain', 'pretty', 'Yoko', 'actress', 'Lennon', 'permissions', 'being', 'granted', 'interspersed', 'clips', 'real', 'events', 'linking', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'indeed', 'fallen', 'apart', 'completely.By', 'way', 'are', 'apparently', 'two', 'versions', 'there', 'BBC', 'PBS', 'latter', 'purchased', 'pointless', 'edits', 'foul', 'language.I', 'should', 'have', 'listened', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'warned', 'save', 'money']",Lennon Naked
1376576,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,B003YOZNCE,TheBandit,"[12, 14]","This is a very difficult movie to get through. As anyone who has read a book or two about Lennon, or heck even a detailed article about his life, knows he has his negative side. We all are flawed and we've all made poor choices. Lennon was no exception, having abandoned his first wife and child, abused drugs, and sometimes treated friends and business partners with disregard.But, as evidenced by hours upon hours of audio and video footage, Lennon was an interesting, good humored, intensely creative person. None of that is portrayed in Lennon Naked. The film chooses to focus exclusively on the most depressing, least flattering aspects of Lennon's personality. We don't see him writing songs, playing guitar, or recording music.The basic ""plot"" finds Lennon dealing with his father, who abandoned him as a child, returning to his life. After years of not seeing him, Freddie Lennon tries to re-establish a relationship with his son. The results are mixed, as Lennon hasn't forgiven him. During all of this, we see that Lennon treats his own son Julian roughly the same way.I loved Christopher Eccleston as Doctor Who. Not only is he laughably old to be playing Lennon as 20something man (Eccleston is 46, six years older than Lennon at the time of his death), he looks nothing like him. He does a passable vocal impersonation but otherwise does very little to evoke Lennon.Some scenes reenact press conferences that the real actual footage of is readily available (in far worthier films like the 1988 documentary ""Imagine: John Lennon""). In all cases, the actual footage is FAR more compelling than the staged versions. In other words, with so many documentary films existing about Lennon there is little reason to bother with this sad movie.",1,Lennon depicted as a miserable insect,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,1748,"['very', 'difficult', 'movie', 'get', 'through', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'two', 'Lennon', 'heck', 'even', 'detailed', 'article', 'life', 'negative', 'side', 'are', 'flawed', ""'ve"", 'made', 'poor', 'choices', 'Lennon', 'was', 'exception', 'having', 'abandoned', 'first', 'wife', 'child', 'abused', 'drugs', 'sometimes', 'treated', 'friends', 'business', 'partners', 'disregard.But', 'evidenced', 'hours', 'hours', 'audio', 'video', 'footage', 'Lennon', 'was', 'interesting', 'good', 'humored', 'intensely', 'creative', 'person', 'None', 'portrayed', 'Lennon', 'Naked', 'film', 'focus', 'exclusively', 'most', 'depressing', 'least', 'flattering', 'aspects', 'Lennon', 'personality', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'writing', 'songs', 'playing', 'guitar', 'recording', 'music.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'Lennon', 'dealing', 'father', 'who', 'abandoned', 'child', 'returning', 'life', 'years', 'not', 'seeing', 'Freddie', 'Lennon', 're-establish', 'relationship', 'son', 'results', 'are', 'mixed', 'Lennon', ""n't"", 'forgiven', 'see', 'Lennon', 'own', 'son', 'Julian', 'roughly', 'same', 'way.I', 'loved', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Not', 'only', 'laughably', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'Lennon', '20something', 'man', 'Eccleston', '46', 'six', 'years', 'older', 'Lennon', 'time', 'death', 'nothing', 'passable', 'vocal', 'impersonation', 'otherwise', 'very', 'little', 'evoke', 'Lennon.Some', 'scenes', 'reenact', 'press', 'conferences', 'real', 'actual', 'footage', 'readily', 'available', 'far', 'worthier', 'films', '1988', 'documentary', 'Imagine', 'John', 'Lennon', 'cases', 'actual', 'footage', 'FAR', 'more', 'compelling', 'staged', 'versions', 'other', 'words', 'so', 'many', 'documentary', 'films', 'existing', 'Lennon', 'little', 'reason', 'bother', 'sad', 'movie']",Lennon Naked
