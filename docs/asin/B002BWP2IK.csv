1260441,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B002BWP2IK,,"[0, 0]","There's a scene at the end of &#34;Raiders Of The Lost Ark&#34; where, after they've wrested the Ark of The Covenant  from the Nazi's, who got it first, the Ark of The Covenant is seen being taken by forklift to its resting spot in a US Federal warehouse, the implication being that, as awful as its powers have been demonstrated to be, being &#34;lost&#34; in a government warehouse (as the retreating camera suggests will happen) is about the same as being lost in the desert, so we're all safe.  This is where the premise of Warehouse 13 picks up, using of course the cultural knowledge of Area 54 (or is it 51?) as something of a credibility booster.  Someone, it doesn't seem to be The Government itself, goes around and picks up super powered Artifacts that have potential for aiding World Evil, and locks them up in this, the 13th in a series of warehouses (the other 12 burned down, as we learn), where, one man, aided first by one, then two, young women, keeps them safe and locked up;  with two Secret Service agents co-opted to find, &#34;bag and tag&#34; artifacts still out there, and bring them in.An Artifact can be anything.  Lewis Caroll's (&#34;Alice In Wonderland&#34;) mirror, with the apparently psychotic Alice trapped inside;  Edgar Allen Poe's pen, and diary.  Studio 54's disco ball (don't ask).  The premise could be as scary as a right wing nutjob's nightmares, where everything he contacts scares him, but instead such ideas come as more of annoyance.  The tag line for the show runs something to the effect of &#34;We take the things we don't know or understand and lock them up in a warehouse&#34;.  Funny, but not so long ago, we would have brought in the scientists to find out what we don't know, and don't understand, which is how we got to the Moon, and built the Bomb.  And cured polio.  But now we're a society where the recent GOP convention made a big joke out of being a &#34;Fact Checker&#34;, and even the government hating conspiratorialist conservatives didn'f find that alarming, so this is a show for the times.In practice, the show runs as something of a Sci-Fi &#34;Castle&#34; with a handsome, young, unmarried,  odd-couple of sleuths, in this case Secret Service, dumped together, solving crimes that either involve an artifact; or trying to prevent someone from getting an artifact;  or often, in the beginning, going out and retrieving something that has the powers of an artifact, from someone who may not even know its significance.  Eventually, the story arc brings in an agent who's gone to the dark side, and things get a bit more interesting towards the end of Series 1.  Still, for my tastes, things resolve too neatly, too quickly, for this type of show.In any case, when it's been revealed that the loons at the NSA are spying on everybody on the planet, clearly demonstrating that the Government in real life has gone wack-o, would we even want people running around locking up all these &#34;dangerous&#34; things in one central location, under one man's control?Such questions will only ruin your pleasure in this show.  That's the real challenge of this series:  Watch But Don't Think.",3,"Entertaining and Fun, Still Not Great TV",1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,3150,"['scene', 'end', '34', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', '34', 'where', ""'ve"", 'wrested', 'Ark', 'Covenant', 'Nazi', 'who', 'got', 'first', 'Ark', 'Covenant', 'seen', 'being', 'taken', 'forklift', 'resting', 'spot', 'US', 'Federal', 'warehouse', 'implication', 'being', 'that', 'as', 'awful', 'powers', 'have', 'been', 'demonstrated', 'be', 'being', '34', 'lost', '34', 'government', 'warehouse', 'retreating', 'camera', 'will', 'happen', 'same', 'being', 'lost', 'desert', ""'re"", 'safe', 'where', 'premise', 'Warehouse', '13', 'up', 'using', 'course', 'cultural', 'knowledge', 'Area', '54', '51', 'something', 'credibility', 'booster', 'Someone', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'Government', 'around', 'up', 'super', 'powered', 'Artifacts', 'have', 'potential', 'aiding', 'World', 'Evil', 'up', '13th', 'series', 'warehouses', 'other', '12', 'burned', 'down', 'learn', 'where', 'one', 'man', 'aided', 'first', 'one', 'then', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'safe', 'locked', 'up', 'two', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agents', 'co-opted', 'find', '34', 'bag', 'tag', '34', 'artifacts', 'still', 'there', 'bring', 'in.An', 'Artifact', 'can', 'be', 'anything', 'Lewis', 'Caroll', '34', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', '34', 'mirror', 'apparently', 'psychotic', 'Alice', 'trapped', 'inside', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'pen', 'diary', 'Studio', '54', 'disco', 'ball', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'premise', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'scary', 'right', 'wing', 'nutjob', 'nightmares', 'where', 'everything', 'instead', 'such', 'ideas', 'come', 'more', 'annoyance', 'tag', 'line', 'show', 'something', 'effect', '34', 'take', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'understand', 'lock', 'up', 'warehouse', '34', 'Funny', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'scientists', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'got', 'Moon', 'built', 'Bomb', 'cured', 'polio', 'now', ""'re"", 'society', 'where', 'recent', 'GOP', 'convention', 'made', 'big', 'joke', 'being', '34', 'Fact', 'Checker', '34', 'even', 'government', 'hating', 'conspiratorialist', 'conservatives', 'didn', 'f', 'find', 'alarming', 'show', 'times.In', 'practice', 'show', 'something', 'Sci-Fi', '34', 'Castle', '34', 'handsome', 'young', 'unmarried', 'odd-couple', 'sleuths', 'case', 'Secret', 'Service', 'dumped', 'together', 'solving', 'crimes', 'involve', 'artifact', 'trying', 'prevent', 'someone', 'getting', 'artifact', 'often', 'beginning', 'going', 'out', 'retrieving', 'something', 'powers', 'artifact', 'someone', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'significance', 'Eventually', 'story', 'arc', 'brings', 'agent', 'who', 'gone', 'dark', 'side', 'things', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'end', 'Series', '1', 'Still', 'tastes', 'things', 'resolve', 'too', 'neatly', 'too', 'quickly', 'type', 'show.In', 'case', 'when', 'been', 'revealed', 'loons', 'NSA', 'are', 'spying', 'everybody', 'planet', 'clearly', 'demonstrating', 'Government', 'real', 'life', 'gone', 'wack-o', 'would', 'even', 'want', 'people', 'running', 'around', 'locking', 'up', '34', 'dangerous', '34', 'things', 'one', 'central', 'location', 'one', 'man', 'control', 'Such', 'questions', 'will', 'only', 'ruin', 'pleasure', 'show', 'real', 'challenge', 'series', 'Watch', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Think']",Warehouse 13: Season One

1260466,A3OMBJ1RKFWP5M,B002BWP2IK,"Ax20 ""Ax20""","[1, 2]","It's taken two seasons on Sy-fy before I finally checked this show out properly. Actually, I checked out the pilot when it first aired but I didn't watch for long enough (which is to say I only watched the first hour of the two hour pilot) to get a proper feel for it. Or maybe I'm just really in the mood for science fiction involving a team that researches/stops strange things (Primeval, Torchwood, Doctor Who, Sanctuary, Fringe, etc). I didn't originally like it because the first hour felt derivative, but it turned out that the first hour was meant as more of a set up to show how main characters Myka and Pete of the secret service end up working in the middle of nowhere for Warehouse 13.The plot: By-the-book Myka and child-at-heart Pete get sent to Warehouse 13, a secret government project responsible for detecting, subduing, and acquiring dangerous artifacts somehow imbued with a strong emotion/ability from its previous owner (a piece of driftwood from the Titanic freezes people, a personal makeup compact that made Lizzie Borden kill her parents, Lewis Caroll's Looking Glass...). Pete is suited to this job because he has a sort of sixth sense for danger and Myka has a photographic memory. They work with Artie who is in charge of the day to day running of the warehouse, Leena who gets vibes of people's auras (yeah, that one's a head scratcher but okay, if Pete has a sense for danger I'll go with this one too), and Claudia the teenage wiz kid who gets added to the group a few episodes into the series. They also have the occasional visits from Mrs. Frederic, a woman who seems to never age, can seemingly appear and disappear suddenly, and is the caretaker of the warehouse (giving her a special connection the building and providing her with a mental inventory of all the artifacts in the warehouse).The show started a little weak, but quickly gets better as they build on the characters' pasts and the mythology surrounding the warehouse:The Characters- In truth, I find Myka and Pete's back stories to be the weakest on the show, perhaps because their issues are resolved so early on that it doesn't really play a role for that long in who they are. (Myka, for example, has a poor relationship with her father but finally forges a better relationship with him during the show.) It is only when they bring Claudia into the picture and establish her as a part of the team that the show really finds its voice. The reason for this, I think, is that Claudia changed the dynamic. They went from being co-workers to something closer to a family. Artie is the dad, Pete and Myka are the older siblings, Claudia is the kid sister everyone looks out for. Some people would put Leena as the mom, but I don't particularly care for her, she isn't much of a character at this point. This family dynamic is what makes the characters and by extension the show more loveable. We also delve into Artie's mysterious, different-named past, which is always exciting. He's sort of the guy working towards redemption because of past mistakes.The Mythology- here is where things get a little strange but interesting. There have been twelve previous incarnations of the warehouse that have been built in a new location for one reason or another. We have learned in the last two seasons that the warehouse is alive to some degree or another and forms some sort of neural link with its caretaker (in this case Mrs. Frederic). We also learn that they consider Claudia ""destined"" to become the next caretaker. What exactly the caretaker does is a little non-specific, besides mysterious appearances and having a lot of authority. How or why is unclear and though she seems uncertain, that's a step I would love to see the show take. It would give her a more definite and necessary role on the team (right now she and Artie sort of do the same thing). Another question is whether being the caretaker makes you vampire like in that you never age and you theoretically live forever unless you are specifically killed by something.Overall, I think the show has gotten a lot stronger and I'm finding myself really enjoying it. Can't wait for it to come back though the show, having been renewed for a third season, has yet to have been given an actual return date. Can I be the only one who kind of hopes for some residual effects from the abandoned transference of caretaker power?",4,What Took Me So Long?,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,4376,"['taken', 'two', 'seasons', 'Sy-fy', 'finally', 'checked', 'show', 'out', 'properly', 'Actually', 'checked', 'out', 'pilot', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'long', 'enough', 'say', 'only', 'watched', 'first', 'hour', 'two', 'hour', 'pilot', 'get', 'proper', 'feel', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'really', 'mood', 'science', 'fiction', 'involving', 'team', 'strange', 'things', 'Primeval', 'Torchwood', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Sanctuary', 'Fringe', 'etc', 'did', ""n't"", 'originally', 'first', 'hour', 'felt', 'derivative', 'turned', 'out', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'meant', 'more', 'set', 'up', 'show', 'how', 'main', 'characters', 'Myka', 'Pete', 'secret', 'service', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Warehouse', '13.The', 'plot', 'By-the-book', 'Myka', 'child-at-heart', 'Pete', 'get', 'sent', 'Warehouse', '13', 'secret', 'government', 'project', 'responsible', 'detecting', 'subduing', 'acquiring', 'dangerous', 'artifacts', 'somehow', 'imbued', 'strong', 'emotion/ability', 'previous', 'owner', 'piece', 'driftwood', 'Titanic', 'people', 'personal', 'makeup', 'compact', 'made', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'kill', 'parents', 'Lewis', 'Caroll', 'Looking', 'Glass', 'Pete', 'suited', 'job', 'sort', 'sixth', 'sense', 'danger', 'Myka', 'photographic', 'memory', 'work', 'Artie', 'who', 'charge', 'day', 'day', 'running', 'warehouse', 'Leena', 'who', 'vibes', 'people', 'auras', 'yeah', 'one', 'head', 'scratcher', 'okay', 'Pete', 'sense', 'danger', ""'ll"", 'go', 'one', 'too', 'Claudia', 'teenage', 'wiz', 'kid', 'who', 'added', 'group', 'few', 'episodes', 'series', 'also', 'have', 'occasional', 'visits', 'Mrs.', 'Frederic', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'age', 'can', 'seemingly', 'appear', 'disappear', 'suddenly', 'caretaker', 'warehouse', 'giving', 'special', 'connection', 'building', 'providing', 'mental', 'inventory', 'artifacts', 'warehouse', 'show', 'started', 'little', 'weak', 'quickly', 'better', 'build', 'characters', 'pasts', 'mythology', 'surrounding', 'warehouse', 'Characters-', 'truth', 'find', 'Myka', 'Pete', 'back', 'stories', 'be', 'weakest', 'show', 'perhaps', 'issues', 'are', 'resolved', 'so', 'early', ""n't"", 'really', 'play', 'role', 'long', 'who', 'are', 'Myka', 'example', 'poor', 'relationship', 'father', 'finally', 'better', 'relationship', 'show', 'only', 'when', 'bring', 'Claudia', 'picture', 'establish', 'part', 'team', 'show', 'really', 'voice', 'reason', 'think', 'Claudia', 'changed', 'dynamic', 'went', 'being', 'co-workers', 'something', 'closer', 'family', 'Artie', 'dad', 'Pete', 'Myka', 'are', 'older', 'siblings', 'Claudia', 'kid', 'sister', 'everyone', 'out', 'people', 'would', 'put', 'Leena', 'mom', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', ""n't"", 'much', 'character', 'point', 'family', 'what', 'characters', 'extension', 'show', 'more', 'loveable', 'also', 'delve', 'Artie', 'mysterious', 'different-named', 'past', 'always', 'exciting', 'sort', 'guy', 'working', 'towards', 'redemption', 'past', 'mistakes.The', 'Mythology-', 'here', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'little', 'strange', 'interesting', 'have', 'been', 'twelve', 'previous', 'incarnations', 'warehouse', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'new', 'location', 'one', 'reason', 'have', 'learned', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'warehouse', 'alive', 'degree', 'sort', 'neural', 'link', 'caretaker', 'case', 'Mrs.', 'Frederic', 'also', 'learn', 'consider', 'Claudia', 'destined', 'become', 'next', 'caretaker', 'What', 'exactly', 'caretaker', 'little', 'non-specific', 'mysterious', 'appearances', 'having', 'lot', 'authority', 'How', 'why', 'unclear', 'uncertain', 'step', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'show', 'take', 'would', 'give', 'more', 'definite', 'necessary', 'role', 'team', 'right', 'now', 'Artie', 'sort', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'question', 'being', 'caretaker', 'vampire', 'never', 'age', 'theoretically', 'live', 'forever', 'are', 'specifically', 'killed', 'something.Overall', 'think', 'show', 'gotten', 'lot', 'stronger', ""'m"", 'finding', 'really', 'enjoying', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'come', 'back', 'show', 'having', 'been', 'renewed', 'third', 'season', 'yet', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'actual', 'return', 'date', 'Can', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'kind', 'hopes', 'residual', 'effects', 'abandoned', 'transference', 'caretaker', 'power']",Warehouse 13: Season One

Every series which only lasted a few seasons, died for this reason:  i.e., Star Trek died because it never really furthered any long-term plot, but was always an encounter with some alien issue, each time.Ahhh, but Star Trek has a loyal cult following, you'll counter.  Right-e-o.  Why?  Because the cast and script were so perfectly balanced, you didn't CARE that the theme was mildly varied each time, whether Klingon or Ferengi or Q or (older Star Trek).. tribbles.  You didn't care that the set was obviously plastic or plaster;  the cheesy special effects, didn't matter;  didn't matter, that the makeup was obvious, the fight scenes faked.  For the cast and script, made you love it all anyway.  Same, for the Dr. Who series.So Warehouse 13, similarly has great cast, good script (after the Pilot), wonderful ensemble chemistry.  And it's more realistic, with good special effects.  So you don't care how predictable, each episode.  In fact, the reason I started watching, was to see Saul Rubinek 'do his thing'.  I'd never seen the other actors, until this series.  Love them all.I know the plot before it begins, just a question of which 'artifact' will do what to whom, and which way they solve it.  Psychic energy stored in some object, having to be balanced against other objects in a warehouse no one is supposed to know about -- far better idea than the popular Area 51 stuff.

After a round of rather generic standalone episodes, this series bounces off once it introduces a main villain and a plot arc -- and while there's little romantic chemistry, the lead characters are a likable bunch with some nicely handled character development.After a weird incident involving an assassin and an Aztec bloodstone, Secret Service agents Myka Bering (Joanne Kelly) and Pete Lattimer (Eddie McClintock) are summoned to a run-down warehouse in the South Dakota badlands. An eccentric agent called Artie (Saul Rubinek) informs them that this is Warehouse 13, which holds dangerous and bizarre ""artifacts"" -- and their new assignment is to collect and neutralize new artifacts.Among the problems they encounter: a young man possessed by a strange Italian power, bank robberies using music, a teleportation experiment gone wrong, a device that channels enough energy to fry people to a crisp, a katana that can slice through light, a mirror that switches Myka with a malevolent creature, and a prison whose occupants are driven to madness by the ghosts of their pasts. But the most dangerous problem is a former agent of the Warehouse, who is now determined to grab the artifacts for his own purposes -- and destroy Artie and the others as well.Despite being pretty derivative of ""The X-Files"" at times (skeptical strict female agent paired with quirky wild card), ""Warehouse 13"" has a pretty brilliant concept -- basically it's about a place that seals away any dangerous historical artifacts. Among the artifacts: Poe's pen, Lewis Carroll's mirror, a Studio 54 disco ball (which plays ""I Will Survive"" when disturbed) the Tesla gun, a giant steampunky computer and a wishing kettle that produces ferrets.The stories are a solid blend of action, grimy sci-fi (the warehouse is a pretty bleak-looking place), and a bit of comedy on the side (one of the Important Artifact-Seeking Questions is, ""Do you smell fudge?""). While the first few episodes are rather generic one-offs, the plots become tighter and more intense about halfway through -- and the addition of the sociopathic MacPherson and the Regents adds a new level of potential to the arc storyline.Downsides? The dialogue can be painfully cool-kiddish at times, especially when Claudia is being annoyingly self-referential (""Couldn't any genius whiz-kid?""). And the romantic chemistry between Kelly and McClintock is almost nil.But Kelly and McClintock make a solid supernatural-detective duo -- he's a quirky pop-culture-loving weirdo (although I just can't see him as a Secret Service agent) with a weakness for cookies, while her almost-fanatical devotion to rules/plans is explained by a tragic personal loss. Allison Scagliotti does a good job as the erratic ""whiz-kid,"" although her character can be annoying. But Saul Rubinek is the ruling force in this series -- a quirky, gruff, antisocial man who is haunted by the many agents lost in pursuit of artifacts. He's absolutely brilliant.""Warehouse 13 Season 1"" is pretty derivative at times, but it's also strangely endearing and quite fun.

Examples of such items are books, mirrors, swords and chairs, some of which were possessed by famous figures from history.  Once the artifacts are retrieved, they are returned to Warehouse 13, a massive repository located in the remote American midwest.While the show is generally well written and presented, it lacks the must-see pull of shows such as ""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""Lost,"" falling more into the ""Sanctuary"" category, where special effects tend to dominate a decent story that might otherwise lack a pervasive story arc.  Translate that as: Usually, the two main characters track down an item, stick it on a shelf at the end of the show and end with some amusing banter.The aforementioned story arc (or, perhaps, series arc) revolves around the man, Artie, played by Saul Rubinek, who operates the warehouse.  His mysterious background as a former warehouse agent is touched upon in several episodes, along with details about his partner's betrayal and the group behind warehouse operations.  While this arc IS present in the first season, it suffers from a lack of mystery or surprise.  When you find out about something, you might say to yourself, ""Okay.  That's that.""  On ""BSG"" and ""Lost"" there's more of a WOW factor as information is revealed.Eddie McClintock was an excellent choice to play the male agent in ""Warehouse 13.""

1260538,AKB2PYODH0TKS,B002BWP2IK,"Grey Wolffe ""Zeb Kantrowitz""","[17, 24]","If this is the two hour pilot from SciFi then this is my review.  It looks like it will be a good program, it's like a cross between 'X-Files' and 'Fringe' and 'The Mentalist'.  All three programs have a smart woman who works for a government agency partnered with a quirky male.  In fact the woman on 13, Fringe and Mentalist all seem to buy their pants and shirts from the same store (Tight body fitting)!From what I can tell, the Warehouse is the place where they took the ""Ark"" at the end of the first Indiana Jones.  There it sits with a lot of other metaphysical and super-natural stuff and inventions that were way before their time or our time or whatever.  The three leads are all very comfortable with their characters and the secondary characters (Mrs.Fredericks played by CCH Pounder especially) add just the right little extra to make the show enjoyable.  Each week the agents will be sent out to find/rescue/destroy/kidnap/etc. some one or something related to one or more of these strange objects.  How they go about it will be the premise of each episode.Here's hoping that they don't try to make the two agents a couple but keep them as slightly off-center friends.  The woman who runs the bed-and-breakfast would be a good match for the crazy guy agent.  It will depend on how they choose to fill out the story and backgrounds of the agents that will determine whether this becomes a success or a flop.Zeb Kantrowitz",4,If this is the Pilot from SciFi,1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,1434,"['two', 'hour', 'pilot', 'SciFi', 'then', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'program', 'cross', 'X-Files', ""'Fringe"", ""'The"", 'Mentalist', 'three', 'programs', 'have', 'smart', 'woman', 'who', 'government', 'agency', 'partnered', 'quirky', 'male', 'fact', 'woman', '13', 'Fringe', 'Mentalist', 'seem', 'buy', 'pants', 'shirts', 'same', 'store', 'Tight', 'body', 'fitting', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'Warehouse', 'place', 'where', 'took', 'Ark', 'end', 'first', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'lot', 'other', 'metaphysical', 'super-natural', 'stuff', 'inventions', 'were', 'way', 'time', 'time', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'very', 'comfortable', 'characters', 'secondary', 'characters', 'Mrs.Fredericks', 'played', 'CCH', 'Pounder', 'especially', 'add', 'just', 'right', 'little', 'extra', 'make', 'show', 'enjoyable', 'week', 'agents', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'out', 'find/rescue/destroy/kidnap/etc', 'one', 'something', 'related', 'one', 'more', 'strange', 'objects', 'How', 'go', 'will', 'be', 'premise', 'hoping', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'make', 'two', 'agents', 'couple', 'keep', 'slightly', 'off-center', 'friends', 'woman', 'who', 'bed-and-breakfast', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'match', 'crazy', 'guy', 'agent', 'will', 'depend', 'how', 'choose', 'fill', 'out', 'story', 'backgrounds', 'agents', 'will', 'determine', 'success', 'flop.Zeb', 'Kantrowitz']",Warehouse 13: Season One

1260540,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002BWP2IK,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","- Dr. Artie Nielsen to his new Agents: ""And that is exactly what we do here. Take the unexplained, and we just safely tuck it away in this super-sized Pandora's Box. Well, actually, Pandora's Box is over in aisle 989-B. Empty, of course.""X-FILES rubbing up against INDIANA JONES is the tantalizing concept at the heart of WAREHOUSE 13, although, come to think of it, TNT's THE LIBRARIAN movies are even closer to theme. And to top it all off, the show's writers lob in an element of screwball. After saving the President's life at a fancy soir&eacute;e, two gifted Secret Service agents are reassigned indefinitely to the badlands of South Dakota, to the off-the-grid government storage facility called Warehouse 13. Except that Agents Pete Lattimer and Myka Bering are as incompatible as two partners can get. Lattimer is an intuitive maverick, but sort of all over the place. Agent Bering is strictly by-the-books and with a meticulous eye for detail, but she's highly irritable and uptight (although she does loosen up some as the season progresses). I guess they really are Mulder and Scully revisited. Or maybe David Addison and Maddie Hayes? Because there's a pervasive light tone to the series.Both agents regard their reassignment as a sort of punishment, and on the surface you can see why. Stuck in one of the Dakotas, gazing at a fugly structure in the middle of nowhere, and with a weird, messy-looking person offering them cookies and a tour of the place. But inside the ridiculously vast Warehouse 13 is a whole new job description. Or as Mrs. Frederick, cryptic director of the Warehouse project, puts it, this new gig is ""an invitation to endless wonder."" Now Bering and Lattimer find themselves investigating paranormal occurrences and - for the world's peace of mind - confiscating dangerous mystic artifacts and storing them in the deep confines of Warehouse 13. ""Snag it, bag it, and tag it,"" as the show's motto goes. Long as they don't run out of that neutralizing purple solution.There's such a neat factor involved around the artifacts: From the Tesla gun and the Farnsworth communication devices that the agents use to Edgar Allan Poe's pen which can bring its writer's words to life to Lewis Carroll's mirror which houses a vile spirit to Harriet Tubman's illusion-casting thimble. And because most of these knick-knacks are supernatural in nature, you don't get mired in scientific jibber-jabber. This show can pretty much come up with any wicked awesome relic it can think of. As a sports guy, maybe my favorite is the football which circles the planet when you throw it, eventually returning to the thrower like a boomerang.The agents take their orders from Dr. Arthur ""Artie"" Nielsen, the secretive Agent-in-charge who acts as caretaker to Warehouse 13. Artie is fussy, and more than a little high strung, and a perennial crankypants. In other words, actor Sal Rubinek perfectly inhabits the role. Eddie McClintock and Joanne Kelly play the two squabbling Secret Service leads and they're instantly likable, very un-Rubinek-like. I love the barbed repartee between Pete and Myka. They exude that heat. It shouldn't be long before the fans are clamoring for them to pair up.If I were to do one of those word association games and this show was mentioned, my immediate response would be ""helluva lotta fun."" WAREHOUSE 13 shares a similar thread with its sister series SANCTUARY, except that where SANCTUARY is mostly somber and moody, WAREHOUSE 13 is very much tongue-in-cheeked, and this in a way allows its audience to breathe. Pete and eventual newcomer, that cool genius teen Claudia Donovan, are unrepentant wiseacres and, as mentioned, even Myka loosens up some. And, occasionally, the episodes plonk the characters in humorous situations. Maybe my favorite episode of Season One - other than the ""Pilot"" - is the wild ""Breakdown"" episode, in which the Neutralizer Processing Center (which keeps the artifacts dormant) goes on the fritz, leaving Pete, Myka, and Claudia  trapped in a warehouse full of artifacts gone haywire. This is also when we meet the mysterious Regents, to whom Mrs. Frederick answers. ""Duped"" is a close second because it offers a different look at Myka. In ""Duped,"" Myka is caught at ground zero when the Studio 54 disco ball (which unleashes trapped desires) and Lewis Carroll's mirror clash. This episode also features Erica Cerra and Niall Matter (both from EUREKA, but playing different characters).Other noteworthy episodes: ""Resonance,"" if you're a fan of Tricia Helfer who here plays a sexy FBI agent. ""Burnout"" expands the Warehouse 13 mythology as Myka and Pete find the skeleton of a Warehouse 13 agent in the basement of a police precinct. Don't get it twisted, though, there have been bits of world-building and the establishing of thru arcs from jump. The weird ""haunting"" of Warehouse 13 in the early episodes would lead to Claudia Donovan's arrival. We learn of Artie's shady past, and its present-day ramifications. We peek into the Dark Vault, in which the most dangerous artifacts are safeguarded. And in the last arc, the agents come face to face with the greatest threat to Warehouse 13, one of its former agents James MacPherson. This guy is a nasty customer and has a beef with Artie. He also has a knack for consistently staying several steps ahead of Artie and the agents. MacPherson's machinations leave us all hanging in Season One's taut final episode. To be honest, I loved the pilot and but wasn't so into the next four or five episodes (not counting ""Claudia,"" which is pretty good). But with ""Burnout,"" things pick up and the show begins building momentum all the way to the season ender. If you're not watching this show, I say you're missing out on something good. If it's an incentive, Season 2 even features a crossover with the excellent EUREKA.WAREHOUSE 13 - SEASON ONE presents all twelve episodes on three discs and features the following bonus stuff: cast & crew commentaries on 4 episodes (the ""Pilot"" episode with actor Saul Rubinek; ""Claudia"" with actors Joanne Kelly, CCH Pounder, Allison Scagliotti, & producers Jack Kenny and Drew Z. Greenberg; ""Implosion"" with actors Joanne Kelly, CCH Pounder, producer Jack Kenny, and writer Bob Goodman; and ""Macpherson"" with actors CCH Pounder & Allison Scagliotti and producer Jack Kenny); Deleted Scenes for 7 episodes; a so-so gag reel (00:03:13 minutes long); ""Saul Searching"" - Saul Rubinek answers questions from the rest of the cast (00:02:12 minutes); ""Ye Olde Curiousity Shoppe"" - interviews with the cast and crew which cover the characters and concepts and tone of the show (00:11:24); ""Artie-Facts"" - the cast & crew talk about about the various supernatural objects of Warehouse 13 (00:04:51); ""What's in the Shadows"" - covers the dark side of WAREHOUSE 13, such as, oooooh, what's in Warehouse 13's scary Dark Vault?

Fans of X-files can watch it to re-live the guy-lady agent partnership investigating paranormal occurrence. This time round, they are working under the cover of the Secret Service agents. What they are hunting are not aliens but artifacts own by people triggering the occurrence.All the artifacts are kept in a magnetic ziplog bag to be de-sanitised (the ghostbuster part) and ultimately store in the warehouse. Watching this show, one can't help feeling that the writers are trying hard to re-live through the old memories of past achievements by great Americans. Of course it's a little peppered with other artifacts from other cultures and nations. But somehow, their fates are intimately tied to the United States. So its like a nostalgic ride of history.On another positive note, it does raise the hopes to viewers that you may have one day specialized on something and become someone great. For that matter, some intimate items you possess may capture your energy and aspiration, becoming an artifact with special powers for potential Warehouse 13 storage.Overall, I give it a 3 stars for being a entertaining nice show.

Dr. Arthur ""Artie"" Nielsen (Saul Rubenik) is their caring but grouchy boss. I could watch Rubinik read a phone book. He is the best character actor I have ever seen. And speaking of character actors here are some that bring the fun and quirky to the show:* Genelle Williams as Leena is the innkeeper and helps in the warehouse.* Allison Scagliotti as Claudia Donovan is the baby sister agent of the group, and watched over by Artie and Mrs. Frederic.* C. C. H.

The actors are all excellent and the premise is engaging.  The series starts out with the usual two leads attracted to each other but arguing and that has wisely been less a feature of season 2. They don't need that tension and the characters are better off as friends.  But here this series begins it journey and it has a few uneven moments but overall it's just alot of fun.  The dvd set looks great and is worth adding to your collection.  Sure this series has influences from past sci fi shows however this one also is a bit on the mystical side because many artifacts they hunt have 'powers'.  Saul rubinek really adds alot of presence to the whole affair too.  This show just keeps getting better and they do need to make more than just 13 eps a season. They have four lead characters to provide stories for and 20 eps could easily provide them with more adventures.  I think the overall emphasis here is on entertainment and who cares what it's comparible too? I don't , I just enjoy this show. Just like I enjoy the great 'being human' on bbc america.(that's a plug) but wharehouse 13 leaves me with a smile every episode and it's not a dark show like battlestar gallactica ( loved both versions!) but I don't watch this for darkness, it's got humour and fun galore and likeable leads so it's well worth your time.

Their constant bickering is juvenile, tedious, and makes the show feel more like a sitcom than a paranormal thriller. Joanne Kelly's ridiculous hair, make-up, and wardrobe, along with her unnaturally-enlarged lips, are a constant, irritating distraction from the story line. Eddie McClintock has all the sophistication and appeal of a fifth grader. Only thing missing is a laugh track. You wanna be able to take Federal Agents seriously, but these two make that impossible.As for the story line, it's enough to keep you vaguely interested, which is why I grudgingly gave it three stars. But the show's lack of subtlety is a huge problem. The supernatural realm is so conspicuous and easily accessed that it's practically commonplace. This makes an ongoing ""covert"" investigation seem implausible, even unnecessary. You got burglars using music to paralyze multiple victims, magic chairs causing entire groups of people to commit physical (even sexual) assault, robotic parasites jumping on people's backs and controlling their actions... It's all happening in front of scores of witnesses! How could the government possibly be investigating such events ""in secret""? Why even try?

1260679,A2U1AM4GCM9N8Z,B002BWP2IK,"Susannah ""PieGrrrl""","[32, 46]","I gave this series a chance because the idea was dreamed up by Jane Espenson, who wrote so many wonderful scripts for Buffy. After seeing the finished product, I assume she simply passed on the idea and left the development to others - because this has none of the wit, charm and style I associate with her writing.First problem: the characters with the most screen time are annoying in the extreme. It seems that every series must now have a man and woman who perpetually snark at each other, with underlying sexual tension, in the hopes of keeping viewers hanging in for the moment when they tear each other's clothing off - after which said viewers will all go away, never to watch again. This is surely the most tired trope in existence. It was great when it was Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in My Girl Friday, but that was really because the actors and the script were legendary. Now it's just sad that writers believe that every show must have two characters who argue constantly. In this case, it's particularly annoying since the sniping is not witty, and feels so very contrived. Must every show be for adolescents or, worse, 40 year old adolescents?Second problem: Clumsy exposition, in which the woman agent must explain to the man agent every reference that goes back more than two weeks since, apparently, he never had no schoolin' and don't know nothin' about nothin'. Ok, he's dim. Why should we be subjected to ongoing attempts to educate someone who has managed to reach maturity without knowing much more than my four year old niece? I frequently find myself cringing with embarrassment while watching these characters - not a feeling I enjoy overly much. Cultivated stupidity really is not appealing.Third problem: Weak stories that are poorly written, flat and predictable, with no real story arc and no discernible ideas. The predictability alone isn't enough to sink them, but the fact that there's no intrinsic interest to be found in the ""magical"" objects, or the utterly forgettable characters, or the plot, leaves little to hope for.Having said this, there's Saul Rubinek, who is a delightful actor and always worth watching. I don't believe he can carry this show by himself, however, since the other two main characters have so much screen time in which to act stupid and make faces at each other. Have I mentioned they both have the most annoying facial mannerisms? Someone may think their grimacing endearing (to each his own) but I think it's idiotic and there's a limit to how much of that kind of thing I can tolerate.There's one more thing that might incline people to give this show a chance: the wonderful steampunk look of the devices that have been built (obviously very lovingly) for the agents' use both in and outside the Warehouse. They're delightful but, again, not likely to be enough to keep viewers tuned in.I'm not one of those people who give a new show only one chance to hook me. I don't think that's fair. But this show has a lot going against it, most particularly the boring scripts that are devoid of ideas, and the infantile main characters and their strange facial antics, so it's unlikely that I'll be tuned in much beyond the first season.",2,Potential not realized,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,3200,"['gave', 'series', 'chance', 'idea', 'was', 'dreamed', 'up', 'Jane', 'Espenson', 'who', 'wrote', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'scripts', 'Buffy', 'seeing', 'finished', 'product', 'assume', 'simply', 'passed', 'idea', 'left', 'development', 'others', 'none', 'wit', 'charm', 'style', 'associate', 'writing.First', 'problem', 'characters', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'are', 'annoying', 'extreme', 'series', 'must', 'now', 'have', 'man', 'woman', 'who', 'perpetually', 'snark', 'other', 'underlying', 'sexual', 'tension', 'hopes', 'keeping', 'viewers', 'hanging', 'moment', 'when', 'tear', 'other', 'clothing', 'said', 'viewers', 'will', 'go', 'away', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'surely', 'most', 'tired', 'trope', 'existence', 'was', 'great', 'when', 'was', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'My', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'was', 'really', 'actors', 'script', 'were', 'legendary', 'Now', 'just', 'sad', 'writers', 'believe', 'show', 'must', 'have', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'argue', 'constantly', 'case', 'particularly', 'annoying', 'sniping', 'not', 'witty', 'feels', 'so', 'very', 'contrived', 'Must', 'show', 'be', 'adolescents', 'worse', '40', 'year', 'old', 'adolescents', 'Second', 'problem', 'Clumsy', 'exposition', 'woman', 'agent', 'must', 'explain', 'man', 'agent', 'reference', 'back', 'more', 'two', 'weeks', 'apparently', 'never', 'had', 'schoolin', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'nothin', 'nothin', 'Ok', 'dim', 'Why', 'should', 'be', 'subjected', 'ongoing', 'attempts', 'educate', 'someone', 'who', 'managed', 'reach', 'maturity', 'knowing', 'much', 'more', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'frequently', 'find', 'cringing', 'embarrassment', 'watching', 'characters', 'not', 'feeling', 'enjoy', 'overly', 'much', 'Cultivated', 'stupidity', 'really', 'not', 'appealing.Third', 'problem', 'Weak', 'stories', 'are', 'poorly', 'written', 'flat', 'predictable', 'real', 'story', 'arc', 'discernible', 'ideas', 'predictability', 'alone', ""n't"", 'enough', 'sink', 'fact', 'intrinsic', 'interest', 'be', 'found', 'magical', 'objects', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'characters', 'plot', 'little', 'hope', 'for.Having', 'said', 'Saul', 'Rubinek', 'who', 'delightful', 'actor', 'always', 'worth', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'can', 'carry', 'show', 'however', 'other', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'act', 'stupid', 'make', 'other', 'Have', 'mentioned', 'have', 'most', 'annoying', 'facial', 'mannerisms', 'Someone', 'may', 'think', 'grimacing', 'endearing', 'own', 'think', 'idiotic', 'limit', 'how', 'much', 'kind', 'thing', 'can', 'tolerate.There', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'might', 'incline', 'people', 'give', 'show', 'chance', 'wonderful', 'steampunk', 'look', 'devices', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'obviously', 'very', 'lovingly', 'agents', 'use', 'Warehouse', ""'re"", 'delightful', 'again', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'enough', 'keep', 'viewers', 'tuned', 'in.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'give', 'new', 'show', 'only', 'one', 'chance', 'hook', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fair', 'show', 'lot', 'going', 'most', 'particularly', 'boring', 'scripts', 'are', 'devoid', 'ideas', 'infantile', 'main', 'characters', 'strange', 'facial', 'antics', 'unlikely', ""'ll"", 'be', 'tuned', 'much', 'first', 'season']",Warehouse 13: Season One
