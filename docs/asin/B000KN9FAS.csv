1035396,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000KN9FAS,Ernest Jagger,"[3, 3]","I wasn't sure I was going to like this film, but I liked it quite a bit. I'm always on the lookout for Japanese comedies, and the film ""Train Man,"" aka ""Densha Otoku,"" was definitely a worthwhile purchase. The film itself centers around the life of a very nerdy [I would say shy] 22-year-old young man who lives with his parents. Moreover, he does not have a girlfriend. Part of this reason is that he has immersed himself in a world of anime and video games. Our protagonist may be shy, but his personal life is about to take a sudden change. This change will occur when he helps a good-looking young woman who is being harassed on the train. It is on this train ride that Train Man (Takayuki Yamada) comes to the rescue of Hermes (Miki Nakatini): For she is being harassed by a drunk.In her gratitude for helping her out, Hermes asks Train Man for his address, and eventually sends him a set of Hermes tea cups. [Hence the name of this woman he has rescued] What is he too do? Well, he immediately turns to the internet for help. Moreover, several people respond to help him out. With the help of these eager internet friends, Train Man sets out to pursue his romantic interest. I know this sounds a little silly, but this film really works. With all sorts of people trying to give him advice on how to pursue this young woman, a delightful story is brought to film.I understand that this film is based on a true incident that occurred in Japan, and that a television series was made of this incident. I have not seen these, therefore, I cannot comment on them. However, this film stands on its own. Train Man has never been on a date, and does not know what to do. He is desperate in his lonely life to seek out this woman, who for a brief moment gave him a sense of fulfillment--that there is something great missing in his life. I couldn't help but empathize with Train Man, and his attempts to use the only things he knows--the internet, as his way of reaching out to others for help, and in the process even changes those who are attempting to help him. This is a delightful film, and some of the reviewers here have given a better description of the film. I would highly recommend this film to all viewers, as it is a delightfully charming film.

Often, with other movies, I find myself frustrated with translation being not so accurate, but this film didn't irritate me.

I say that the best possible translation effort was made with a success in this film. The quality of translation matters when one watches foreign films.As a comedy I think this film is entertaining. They used this film as one of films shown for Japanese Film Festival in Miami, and I could see other audiences having good time in the theater. I thought the film conveys the culture of Japanese high-tech communication in a proper fashion. Although I am not exactly a nerd (some of my friends say I am, but I insist that I am not), I have had an experience a few years ago where I had to receive support from a certain group of anonymous Japanese persons online, who understood a very specific issue, and I think my overcoming that issue had a lot to do with the online support from people I didn't even know their names.It is true that Japanese online community has unbelievably strong bond  and influences to us in a way that wasn't so before Internet came along.

1035409,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B000KN9FAS,Zack Davisson,"[7, 9]","Based on a true story, ""Densha Otoku (literally translated as ""Train Man"")"" is the kind of romance that could only happen in Japan.  Partly due to the ubiquitous nature of 2-channel, a country-encompassing internet chat board that puts things like MySpace and YouTube to shame. Partly due to the otaku, a style of unsocial misfit that could only be cultured in the group-based society of Japan.I should say ostensibly based on a true story. Although the real Train Man and Hermes have never been identified, the origin of the phenomenon is a fact.  What is known for sure is that, a poster known as Densha Otoku started a thread on 2-channel telling about how he helped a woman on a train who was being harassed by some drunk salaryman. In gratitude, she sent him a set of teacups from Hermes department store, which would be the equivalent of Saks Fifth Avenue or Harrods in London.  Thinking that the value of the gift is far greater than the service he performed, Densha Otoku sought advice from his fellow otakus on 2-channel on what to do.  And the legend was born.There have been many adaptations of the popular story, starting with a book that reproduced the 2-channel posts, then a comic book and a TV series.  This movie, starring Takayuki Yamada and Miki Nakatani, presents the whole story and does an excellent job showing the fairy tale nature of the romance.  Densha Otoku is not a bad guy, just socially awkward and someone who never really learned how to relate to women.  His moment of bravery is nothing daring, and he is no hero, but the small gesture of protection is just what is needed at just the right moment. Miki Nakatani, a mid-level pop star in Japan, is perfect as Hermes,. She is not a great beauty, just a sweet woman who seems to have had her share of bad luck with men, and is willing to give a nice guy a chance.Aside from the two leads, much of real charm of ""Densha Otoku"" are the 2-channelers themselves.  Swept up completely in the story, they swarm the fashionable districts of Tokyo, studying up on English tea and fashionable places to buy suits and go to dinner, all so they can give the best advice to our wayward hero.  Showing the isolated nature of modern Japan, a husband and wife are both equally involved in the internet events, all though neither one realizes that their partner is also online.  Hiding under the masks of screen names, so many modern Japanese people lead secret lives on 2-channel, and it took the story of Train Man and Hermes to break them out of their shells and get them back into the living world.I'm glad to see ""Densha Otoku"" get an English-language DVD release.
