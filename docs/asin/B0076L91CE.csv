1526796,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0076L91CE,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[0, 0]","The film is bad, but that is not to say it lacks entertainment value. Entertainment value comes from the fact the film is so badly made it is funny. First off their are really only two films. The first two films are nearly 4 hours. The third film is a 2 hour version of the first two films combined.The film takes place in ""Southern City.""  It was actually filmed in Lexington, which is not too southern and most likely didn't want to be associated with the film.T.K. Kane ( Frank Farhat) is the main character. He is the ""Mad Max""/ ""Billy Jack"" hero. He joins a group of walled in people called Dregs. They must contend with two factions: the zombies and the Upper Class.The zombies can speak and reason. They only come out at night  and stay out of sun light, except that which comes through doors and windows. The zombies were created by a protein diet supplement which causes a craving for protein, any protein except horse meat.The Upper Class is a group of controlling psychos lead by Adam (Matthew Perry) former prison inmate. The control the Dregs and other sectors.Kane is seeking something, he just doesn't know what. His real identity is revealed in part 2 which includes a nice recap of part 1.Why this film is bad, but might be entertaining:1) The sound man was terrible. The hitting sounds didn't always match the blows which never landed on the individual. The clip clop of the heels of the woman walking on the bridge doesn't match her steps.2) the acting was horrible. Many of the cast have the same last name and are also part of the production crew.3) The dialogue was lame.4) Zombies engage in a fist fight. It just looked stupid.5) CG graphics are cheap.6) Sound track was lame. The guy who did it was also an extra.7) The school yard bully aspect of the initial encounter with the Upper Class was cheesy.The film teases us with some opening zombie nudity, but never repeats it. Yes, the manged to master the opening teaser, but nothing else.This would appeal to a limited audience, most likely those who praise ""Brain Dead"" productions. May be too bad even for Asylum fans.Parental Guide: F-bomb, early nude scene. 1 star for most viewers.",3,GOD TOOK THE LAST TRAIN OUT,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,2161,"['film', 'bad', 'not', 'say', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Entertainment', 'value', 'fact', 'film', 'so', 'badly', 'made', 'funny', 'First', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'two', 'films', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'nearly', '4', 'hours', 'third', 'film', '2', 'hour', 'version', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'combined.The', 'film', 'place', 'Southern', 'City', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Lexington', 'not', 'too', 'southern', 'most', 'likely', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'associated', 'film.T.K', 'Kane', 'Frank', 'Farhat', 'main', 'character', 'Mad', 'Max', '/', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'hero', 'group', 'walled', 'people', 'called', 'Dregs', 'must', 'contend', 'two', 'factions', 'zombies', 'Upper', 'Class.The', 'zombies', 'can', 'speak', 'reason', 'only', 'come', 'out', 'night', 'stay', 'sun', 'light', 'doors', 'windows', 'zombies', 'were', 'created', 'protein', 'diet', 'supplement', 'craving', 'protein', 'protein', 'horse', 'meat.The', 'Upper', 'Class', 'group', 'controlling', 'psychos', 'lead', 'Adam', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'former', 'prison', 'inmate', 'control', 'Dregs', 'other', 'sectors.Kane', 'seeking', 'something', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'real', 'identity', 'revealed', 'part', '2', 'nice', 'recap', 'part', '1.Why', 'film', 'bad', 'might', 'be', 'entertaining:1', 'sound', 'man', 'was', 'terrible', 'hitting', 'sounds', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'match', 'blows', 'never', 'landed', 'individual', 'clip', 'clop', 'heels', 'woman', 'walking', 'bridge', ""n't"", 'match', 'steps.2', 'acting', 'was', 'horrible', 'Many', 'cast', 'have', 'same', 'last', 'name', 'are', 'also', 'part', 'production', 'crew.3', 'dialogue', 'was', 'lame.4', 'Zombies', 'engage', 'fist', 'fight', 'just', 'looked', 'stupid.5', 'CG', 'graphics', 'are', 'cheap.6', 'Sound', 'track', 'was', 'lame', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'was', 'also', 'extra.7', 'school', 'yard', 'bully', 'aspect', 'initial', 'encounter', 'Upper', 'Class', 'was', 'cheesy.The', 'film', 'teases', 'opening', 'zombie', 'nudity', 'never', 'Yes', 'manged', 'master', 'opening', 'teaser', 'nothing', 'else.This', 'would', 'appeal', 'limited', 'audience', 'most', 'likely', 'who', 'praise', 'Brain', 'Dead', 'productions', 'May', 'be', 'too', 'bad', 'even', 'Asylum', 'fans.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'early', 'nude', 'scene', '1', 'star', 'most', 'viewers']",N/A

I wasted my time and money.The script in this movie is horrible; some tried to skate into the zombie ring and fell instantly and got eaten.The sound is way off from the movie, the words the actors speak are softly, and the background music overtakes that, thus you need to turn the volume up to hear the words but get too much loudness from the treble and bass.The zombies are unrealistic and actually fight back as if they were drunk and in a honky-tonk bar, at one point you can hear someone dialing out on a phone in the background of the set.The makeup is horrible, the acting is just as bad, I never heard of zombies being afraid of the daylight... I thought that was a vampire thing.  The lighting of the movie really needs to be adjusted, there are some dark scenes that you need a flashlight for and it wouldn't matter if you had one.. What you're watching would suck anyway.Any action/fight scenes in the movie were so obviously fake you need to skip them with your remote.The location being filmed is an abandoned housing project, and an even dirtier closed city set.I turned it off after the first movie, and didn't make it to the 2nd one, or the 3rd.Needless to say, as an avid zombie DVD collection collector... Owning at current every zombie movie ever made and having watched them as well, this has to be the worst zombie movie I have seen since Zombiez.Bad zombies and bad makeup, No hot chicks, no cool guns, no boobs no ass, no nudity whatsoever, No fast cars or good food, WTF?Listen to me please, Don't waste your money...
