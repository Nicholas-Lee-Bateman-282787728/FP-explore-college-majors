Crawford ""danielc_1978""","[4, 4]","I'm usually not big on movies that one has to read but this one was well worth it especially if you are interested in adoption or providing foster care to a troubled child. This movie follows a severely emotionally/behaviorally disturbed child through the foster care system until he finally finds a family that starts meeting his needs. What I liked about the movie is that it didn't fall into any stereotypes in which they made the boy look evil like most adoption movies do. I hate seeing movies that show adopted/foster children like they are demons. With that said, this movie was truthful about behaviors that these children display: self injury, animal cruelty, stealing, fighting, violence etc. The only difference is that it also showed that the boy had a good heart too. Every adopted and foster child I have taken care of deep down had a good heart regardless of the behavior they showed. They were just hurt and trying to find their way in this cruel world. They were basically lost, ""Naked"" emotionally. About 3/4th through the movie, one can see the boy start smiling for the first time and connecting. That family helped that boy become a better person even though he still struggled with making proper decisions. The foster mother kept stating she didn't know what to do about him but she kept repeating, ""He has a good heart."" Great movie and that last statement basically sums it up.",5,Very Good Movie from the point of view of a foster child.,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,1401,"[""'m"", 'usually', 'not', 'big', 'movies', 'one', 'read', 'one', 'was', 'well', 'especially', 'are', 'interested', 'adoption', 'providing', 'foster', 'care', 'troubled', 'child', 'movie', 'severely', 'emotionally/behaviorally', 'disturbed', 'child', 'foster', 'care', 'system', 'finally', 'family', 'meeting', 'needs', 'What', 'liked', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'stereotypes', 'made', 'boy', 'look', 'evil', 'most', 'adoption', 'movies', 'do', 'hate', 'seeing', 'movies', 'show', 'adopted/foster', 'children', 'are', 'demons', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'truthful', 'behaviors', 'children', 'display', 'self', 'injury', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'stealing', 'fighting', 'violence', 'etc', 'only', 'difference', 'also', 'showed', 'boy', 'had', 'good', 'heart', 'too', 'Every', 'adopted', 'foster', 'child', 'have', 'taken', 'care', 'deep', 'down', 'had', 'good', 'heart', 'regardless', 'behavior', 'showed', 'were', 'just', 'hurt', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'cruel', 'world', 'were', 'basically', 'lost', 'Naked', 'emotionally', '3/4th', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'boy', 'start', 'smiling', 'first', 'time', 'connecting', 'family', 'helped', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'even', 'still', 'struggled', 'making', 'proper', 'decisions', 'foster', 'mother', 'kept', 'stating', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'kept', 'repeating', 'good', 'heart', 'Great', 'movie', 'last', 'statement', 'basically', 'sums', 'up']",N/A
1354568,A3697UKT5TIN04,B003N2CVQI,"John ""pianoman""","[0, 0]","L'enfance Nue is about ten year old Franois (Michel Terrazon) who has just recently been taken from a foster home and put into the lives of yet another family. We get the sense, from his reaction, that this is not something new. Franois is problem child, to say the least, and takes his anger out by vandalism and killing animals, which is very extreme. Yet there is something about Franois that makes him likable, funnily enough. We see, in certain scenes, that he indeed has a good heart, and all he wants to do is be loved and accepted by the people around him. The ending gives us a glimpse of hope for this child, and will leave you with a sense of emptiness after watching. However, that is not to say the emptiness is bad. On the contrary, the emptiness is what you should feel, for you feel how poor little Franois feels and finally can understand the pain and loneliness he has been going through all along. This movie did a wonderful job at tugging my heartstring and bringing out emotions that made me feel and care about the main character in a profound way.

Hey guys, this is realism!!! Seriously, I turned the movie off at that point, and I think it was about 10 minutes into the film..prior to that, it was completely flat---nothing even remotely interesting. By contract, watch a film like The Naked Kiss by Samuel Fuller and you will understand how to open a film, how to grab the viewer's attention. There are many great films about disturbed childhoods...this is NOT one of them.
