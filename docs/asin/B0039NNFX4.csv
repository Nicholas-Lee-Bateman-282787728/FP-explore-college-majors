1333837,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0039NNFX4,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I loved `Father of the Bride'.  It made me cry.  Yes, I'm a softy.  Spencer Tracy makes me happy and Elizabeth Taylor was a goddess.  I can't help myself.  In all honesty, as great a film year as 1950 was, I'd place `Father of the Bride' toward the top of the pack.  It was smart, honest and witty.  Spencer Tracy should have won the Oscar and the amazing Joan Bennett should have at least been up for one!  With much anticipation, I settled in to watch the sequel, `Father's Little Dividend'.  Like my experience with the original, I had seen the 90's Steve Martin remake already and so my expectations were slightly skewed.Where I felt that the 91' Martin vehicle actually stayed rather close to the 1950 Tracy classic, as far as story is concerned (it isn't nearly as good as the original, but it has its moments), the 1951 `Father's Little Dividend' is vastly different than `Father of the Bride, Part II'.Instead of giving us dueling `expectant mothers', `Father's Little Dividend' focuses more on Stanley Banks' acceptance of his daughter's growing belly and his attempt to regain his youth (in a more introverted sense that Martin's antics) and his coping with his wife's emotional upheaval at the thought of her son-in-law's parents taking over everything.  While not as sharp as the original or as engaging, `Father's Little Dividend' is a respectable sequel, especially when you consider how it was basically thrown together in order to capitalize on the unexpected success of the original (it was released less than a year after the original hit theaters).  Spencer Tracy doesn't do anything new with the character, and the regurgitated `father fixes daughter's relationship' scene felt unnecessary and rather lazy, but Joan Bennett is Oscar worthy again (honestly, maybe one of the best characters created in the 50's) and the film's finale made me cry yet again.If you loved the first, you'll really like the second.",4,A nice follow up to one of the best films of the 50's...,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,1929,"['loved', 'Father', 'Bride', 'made', 'cry', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'softy', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'happy', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'was', 'goddess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'honesty', 'great', 'film', 'year', '1950', 'was', ""'d"", 'place', 'Father', 'Bride', 'top', 'pack', 'was', 'smart', 'honest', 'witty', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'amazing', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'been', 'up', 'one', 'much', 'anticipation', 'settled', 'watch', 'sequel', 'Father', 'Little', 'Dividend', 'experience', 'original', 'had', 'seen', '90', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'remake', 'already', 'so', 'expectations', 'were', 'slightly', 'skewed.Where', 'felt', '91', 'Martin', 'vehicle', 'actually', 'stayed', 'rather', 'close', '1950', 'Tracy', 'classic', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'concerned', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'moments', '1951', 'Father', 'Little', 'Dividend', 'vastly', 'different', 'Father', 'Bride', 'Part', ""II'.Instead"", 'giving', 'dueling', 'expectant', 'mothers', 'Father', 'Little', 'Dividend', 'focuses', 'more', 'Stanley', 'Banks', 'acceptance', 'daughter', 'growing', 'belly', 'attempt', 'regain', 'youth', 'more', 'introverted', 'sense', 'Martin', 'antics', 'coping', 'wife', 'emotional', 'upheaval', 'thought', 'son-in-law', 'parents', 'taking', 'over', 'everything', 'not', 'as', 'sharp', 'original', 'engaging', 'Father', 'Little', 'Dividend', 'respectable', 'sequel', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'how', 'was', 'basically', 'thrown', 'together', 'order', 'capitalize', 'unexpected', 'success', 'original', 'was', 'released', 'less', 'year', 'original', 'hit', 'theaters', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'new', 'character', 'regurgitated', 'father', 'fixes', 'daughter', 'relationship', 'scene', 'felt', 'unnecessary', 'rather', 'lazy', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'again', 'honestly', 'maybe', 'one', 'best', 'characters', 'created', '50', 'film', 'finale', 'made', 'cry', 'yet', 'loved', 'first', ""'ll"", 'really', 'like', 'second']",Father's Little Dividend - 1951

Bickert ""eagle girl""","[0, 0]","Before buying this movie for my mom I was going to purchase the cheaper DVD version until I read all of the negative feedback regarding the picture and sound quality. I was a little relieved when I then came upon this version of the movie made by digicom. I then read all the great reviews given by people who paid a little more money and received the better quality picture and sound. Needless to say I decided on buying this DVD from this company. Boy was I surprised when I put the DVD in the player for my mom. The picture quality was crystal clear, sound was perfect. Bottom line is, is you will definitely not be sorry buying from this company, spend the few bucks more and enjoy this movie. I'm glad I made my mom happy. Thank you to all the reviewers for this version as well as the cheaper version, I was glad that all of your reviews led me to buying the better DVD.",5,BUY THIS DVD AWESOME QUALITY,1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,876,"['buying', 'movie', 'mom', 'was', 'going', 'purchase', 'cheaper', 'DVD', 'version', 'read', 'negative', 'feedback', 'regarding', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'little', 'relieved', 'when', 'then', 'came', 'version', 'movie', 'made', 'digicom', 'then', 'read', 'great', 'reviews', 'given', 'people', 'who', 'paid', 'little', 'more', 'money', 'received', 'better', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'Needless', 'say', 'decided', 'buying', 'DVD', 'company', 'Boy', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'mom', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'crystal', 'clear', 'sound', 'was', 'perfect', 'Bottom', 'line', 'will', 'definitely', 'not', 'be', 'sorry', 'buying', 'company', 'spend', 'few', 'bucks', 'more', 'enjoy', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'made', 'mom', 'happy', 'Thank', 'reviewers', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'cheaper', 'version', 'was', 'glad', 'reviews', 'led', 'buying', 'better', 'DVD']",Father's Little Dividend - 1951
1333839,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B0039NNFX4,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","The cast and crew returned to make this sequel when it became clear the first film was a big hit.  In their haste to cash in, this ""addition"" to the story is a bit slapdash.  They reuse the same setup as the first film, having Spencer Tracy sitting in a chair opining to the audience about the news of his cherished daughter Kay having a baby.  Instead of treating the news with great joy, as does his wife Ellie (Joan Bennett), Stanley (Tracy) turns into a grumpy old fart, angry because this means he's now a grandpa.  He spends the bulk of this short film (82 minutes) crabby and resentful, worse, he soon turns his animosity on his grandson, at one point Stanley carelessly loses him by the side of the road while he's off playing with a bunch of kids!This film definitely has less appeal than the first one.  There's an overwhelming sense of desperation throughout, as though they were trying too hard to match the fun of the original, everything feels forced.  The fact that they allowed their copyright to lapse, forcing this film into the arena of public domain, says a lot.  If they considered it as  important as the original film, they wouldn't have tossed it away so casually.",3,"""If she took her toothbrush she's not heading for the river.""",1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,1188,"['cast', 'crew', 'returned', 'make', 'sequel', 'when', 'became', 'clear', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'big', 'hit', 'haste', 'cash', 'addition', 'story', 'bit', 'slapdash', 'reuse', 'same', 'setup', 'first', 'film', 'having', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'sitting', 'chair', 'opining', 'audience', 'news', 'cherished', 'daughter', 'Kay', 'having', 'baby', 'Instead', 'treating', 'news', 'great', 'joy', 'wife', 'Ellie', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'Stanley', 'Tracy', 'grumpy', 'old', 'fart', 'angry', 'now', 'grandpa', 'bulk', 'short', 'film', '82', 'minutes', 'crabby', 'resentful', 'worse', 'soon', 'animosity', 'grandson', 'one', 'point', 'Stanley', 'carelessly', 'side', 'road', 'off', 'playing', 'bunch', 'kids', 'film', 'definitely', 'less', 'appeal', 'first', 'one', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'desperation', 'were', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'match', 'fun', 'original', 'everything', 'feels', 'forced', 'fact', 'allowed', 'copyright', 'lapse', 'forcing', 'film', 'arena', 'public', 'domain', 'lot', 'considered', 'as', 'important', 'original', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'tossed', 'away', 'so', 'casually']",Father's Little Dividend - 1951
