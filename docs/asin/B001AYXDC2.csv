One of my favorite episodes is on this DVD, where a girl is taken to a party, not permitted to leave, and then ambushed at a gas station.  The betrayel of her supposed best friend, it's just disgusting.  Once again, Judy dispenses the justice, though one can be forgiven if they think she has an acid tongue.  Of course, most of those who get her venom rather tend to deserve it.  Oh well.  I had a great time watching it.

1169142,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B001AYXDC2,JGC,"[26, 30]","Following the release of Judge Judy's first DVD, the hugely successfulJudge Judy: Justice Served, this is the latest best-of DVD from everyone's favorite Judge. ""Judge Judy: Second to None"" is 1 DVD and a total of 1 hour and 46 minutes in length which also includes bonuses as well. (By the way, Judge Judy's new season begins on 9/8.)I love Judge Judy because she's always funny and completely wise. I've watched her show for years and what I appreciate the most about her is her consistency. She treats everyone the same and doesn't put up with any garbage. I was just watching Judge Judy the other day and some lady was suing her ex-boyfriend and she tried to bring up an affair and Judge Judy said, ""you want to talk about that, go somewhere else, but not here."" And I think that statement really embodies what her show is about. Another reason why I enjoy Judge Judy is because she is very fair and compassionate. She doesn't come to the bench spitting ricochets. Nope. It's only after her litigants either try to lie or show their complete foolishness does she get angry. The best words to describe Judge Judy and her show are: common sense. That's her show in a nutshell because she follows the laws of the land, but she also has basic common sense, which apparently some of her litigants neglect. Judge Judy also created the entire sub-genre of arbitration TV because her show is handled much more like a binding arbitrator in that she does not bang gavels and there is less reflection on money and more reflection on people and circumstances. It's no coincidence that nearly every single other court show on American TV is patterned after and adjudicated in the same method as Judge Judy's series because she set the standard.",5,order in the court,1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,1735,"['Following', 'release', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'first', 'DVD', 'hugely', 'successfulJudge', 'Judy', 'Justice', 'Served', 'latest', 'best-of', 'DVD', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'Judge', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'Second', 'None', '1', 'DVD', 'total', '1', 'hour', '46', 'minutes', 'length', 'also', 'bonuses', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'new', 'season', '9/8', 'love', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'always', 'funny', 'completely', 'wise', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'show', 'years', 'what', 'appreciate', 'most', 'consistency', 'everyone', 'same', ""n't"", 'put', 'up', 'garbage', 'was', 'just', 'watching', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'other', 'day', 'lady', 'was', 'suing', 'ex-boyfriend', 'tried', 'bring', 'up', 'affair', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'said', 'want', 'talk', 'go', 'somewhere', 'else', 'not', 'here', 'think', 'statement', 'really', 'what', 'show', 'about', 'reason', 'why', 'enjoy', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'very', 'fair', 'compassionate', ""n't"", 'come', 'bench', 'spitting', 'ricochets', 'Nope', 'only', 'litigants', 'try', 'lie', 'show', 'complete', 'foolishness', 'get', 'angry', 'best', 'words', 'describe', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'show', 'are', 'common', 'sense', 'show', 'nutshell', 'laws', 'land', 'also', 'basic', 'common', 'sense', 'apparently', 'litigants', 'neglect', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'also', 'created', 'entire', 'sub-genre', 'arbitration', 'TV', 'show', 'handled', 'much', 'more', 'binding', 'arbitrator', 'not', 'bang', 'gavels', 'less', 'reflection', 'money', 'more', 'reflection', 'people', 'circumstances', 'coincidence', 'nearly', 'single', 'other', 'court', 'show', 'American', 'TV', 'patterned', 'adjudicated', 'same', 'method', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'series', 'set', 'standard']",Judge Judy: Second to None

I have to say having watched many episodes of this programme there was only one episode that I felt her judgement was impaired, and that was the case of the housewife who had several children to look after and Judge Judy asked her why she did not have a job or could not get a job. Looking after children of school age is a job itself which I'm sure she knows but somehow overlooked.
