I don't know how many films have done exactly what Riddick has done, but the first one that comes to mind is Event Horizon.  Like Event Horizon, Riddick starts off with a promising premise. A sort of training ground, if you will. Riddick is tired of being Lord Marshall and decides not to take the oath to remain in office. As a result, a lot of people around him disrespect him and that decision and want to kill him so they can usurp the title from him.Being tired of the role he's been forced into, Riddick decides to run off and look for his home world Furya, with the help of some people that, for whatever reason, he trusts. Unfortunately, that trust is misplaced when they strand him on a fairly inhospitable world, not unlike the planet in Pitch Black. These people also attempt to kill him before stranding him, but the best they accomplish is sending him hurtling down a landslide to a broken leg. After coming to, Riddick realizes he's become complacent and rusty. He realizes he needs to hone his skills, to get his edge back. After being dropped on this eat-or-be-eaten world injured, he begins overcoming the odds by going from prey to predator using only his wits and skill. Again, an awesome starting premise.Unfortunately, this is the point where the promising start ends. At about the half-way mark in this film, the writers take an about-face and turn this film into a Pitch Black clone with slightly different rules. Instead of darkness bringing out the creatures, rain does. And that's when the killing begins, at least mostly not by Riddick's hand. Riddick also realizes he needs to get off the planet by trying to obtain a ship. Unfortunately, he has a few surly bounty hunters he needs to dispose of first. So, the remaining part of the film is about either Riddick or the creatures picking off the bounty hunter ship crew one by one until they join him or die. Riddick does have a few choice scenes in the latter half, but not enough to make up for the incredibly trite last half of the film.Riddick (the film) simply becomes a clone of Pitch Black and ultimately a been-there-done-that moment. This film doesn't deserve one star because it's at least entertaining up to the half-way mark including a few parts of the second half. The effects are reasonably decent and the jet-cycles are completely cool. If the writers had continued on with Riddick having some quality alone-time and honing his skills, then quickly making his way off the planet to go after the guy who stranded him there, I'd have been all over that plot. Unfortunately, it turned into a sentimental journey reminiscing about the Pitch Black days and also mimicking Pitch Black in the process. At the end, you're left scratching your head trying to decide what everyone really accomplished.",3,"Started out promising, ended up a clone",1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,2920,"['***SPOILERS', 'AHEAD***', 'Stop', 'reading', 'now', 'want', 'watch', 'filmRiddick', 'poster-child', 'film', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'bucked', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'exactly', 'what', 'Riddick', 'done', 'first', 'one', 'mind', 'Event', 'Horizon', 'Event', 'Horizon', 'Riddick', 'promising', 'premise', 'sort', 'training', 'ground', 'will', 'Riddick', 'tired', 'being', 'Lord', 'Marshall', 'not', 'take', 'oath', 'remain', 'office', 'result', 'lot', 'people', 'disrespect', 'decision', 'want', 'kill', 'so', 'can', 'usurp', 'title', 'him.Being', 'tired', 'role', 'been', 'forced', 'Riddick', 'run', 'off', 'look', 'home', 'world', 'Furya', 'help', 'people', 'reason', 'Unfortunately', 'trust', 'misplaced', 'when', 'strand', 'fairly', 'inhospitable', 'world', 'not', 'planet', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'people', 'also', 'attempt', 'kill', 'stranding', 'best', 'accomplish', 'sending', 'hurtling', 'down', 'landslide', 'broken', 'leg', 'coming', 'Riddick', 'become', 'complacent', 'rusty', 'hone', 'skills', 'get', 'edge', 'back', 'being', 'dropped', 'eat-or-be-eaten', 'world', 'injured', 'overcoming', 'odds', 'going', 'prey', 'predator', 'using', 'only', 'wits', 'skill', 'Again', 'awesome', 'starting', 'premise.Unfortunately', 'point', 'where', 'promising', 'start', 'half-way', 'mark', 'film', 'writers', 'take', 'about-face', 'turn', 'film', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'clone', 'slightly', 'different', 'rules', 'Instead', 'darkness', 'bringing', 'out', 'creatures', 'rain', 'when', 'killing', 'least', 'mostly', 'not', 'Riddick', 'hand', 'Riddick', 'also', 'get', 'off', 'planet', 'trying', 'obtain', 'ship', 'Unfortunately', 'few', 'surly', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'dispose', 'first', 'So', 'remaining', 'part', 'film', 'Riddick', 'creatures', 'picking', 'off', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'ship', 'crew', 'one', 'one', 'join', 'die', 'Riddick', 'have', 'few', 'choice', 'scenes', 'latter', 'half', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'incredibly', 'trite', 'last', 'half', 'film.Riddick', 'film', 'simply', 'clone', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'ultimately', 'been-there-done-that', 'moment', 'film', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'one', 'star', 'least', 'entertaining', 'up', 'half-way', 'mark', 'including', 'few', 'parts', 'second', 'half', 'effects', 'are', 'reasonably', 'decent', 'jet-cycles', 'are', 'completely', 'cool', 'writers', 'had', 'continued', 'Riddick', 'having', 'quality', 'alone-time', 'honing', 'skills', 'then', 'quickly', 'making', 'way', 'planet', 'go', 'guy', 'who', 'stranded', 'there', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'plot', 'Unfortunately', 'turned', 'sentimental', 'journey', 'reminiscing', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'days', 'also', 'mimicking', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'process', 'end', ""'re"", 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'trying', 'decide', 'what', 'everyone', 'really', 'accomplished']",N/A

I could not figure out in advance how Riddick (played by Vin Diesel) could kill the giant, scorpion-liked monsters that lived in the water.The special effects were  life-like and amazing, especially with the monsters and the hyena-liked dog. They did help make  the film more interesting.The way Riddick eliminated his hunters was also gripping. Katee Sackhoff and Jordi Moll&agrave; were convincing as bounty hunters. Matt Nable was engaging in his role. In the last half of the picture,  Jordi Moll&agrave; acted like a fool, not like the capable leader of the bounty hunters.  I did not like that.The action scenes were fast paced, decisive and interesting.There was some humor too which made the movie more enjoyable.Of course, it had big logical holes but I was able to suppress my logic to enjoy the film.According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this movie:Production Budget: $38 millionDomestic:  $41,199,570+ Foreign:  $48,000,000Worldwide:  $89,199,570So, this movie took in 51 million dollars more than its production budget.

Britzman,"[0, 0]","The Riddick movies all take place on the fringes of a futuristic human universe, far from Earth, and what we have here is a loner who apparently got himself in criminal trouble long ago, and has been on the run ever since (I haven't tried any of the Riddick video games, or read up on the backstory that goes along with them ; I only know what the three movies have shown). If Riddick is a representative specimen of the people of his native planet, Furya, then we can surmise, as always, that strong, cunning, superlatively trained and highly intelligent people that take responsibility for their actions (and inactions) will quickly run afoul of  'normal' society, where such things are feared and/or make life harder for the parasites that prey on it. As you watch the movies, you get the feeling Riddick is just another man who did what he had to at some point, and it just happened to be against the law, whatever it was (probably murder). Like in StarTrek, we never learn much about mainstream society in the Riddick universe (maybe none exists), but unlike in Trek, as humans have spread outward in the galaxy, they have encountered no other technological alien societies yet. But there are plenty of highly-evolved hostile alien animals on the various Earthlike planets Riddick finds himself on. The Necromonger episode of 'Chronicles Of Riddick' was Riddick's highest profile in the large scale events of the human universe, while both 'Pitch Black' and 'Riddick' take place more in Riddick's native context : in the backwaters and shadows, pursued by both bounty hounters and hostile alien creatures.'Riddick' is action/adventure, first and always, and as such requires the usual suspension of disbelief from the viewer, which we should all be well-practiced with by now. I gave it four stars simply because I think there are deeper scifi efforts out there, but I ain't complaining. The special effects I found to be more than adequate for immersion into the story, and the CGI dog/hyena steals every scene it's in!If this third movie seems like a repeat of former story elements, it's because Riddick is still Riddick , dealing with a Riddick life, and I love watching his style, decisions, problem solving, and coolness under pressure. In some ways, his life is like that feather blowing around at the end of Forrest Gump ; each chapter of his life sets him up for the next.

While ""Chronicles of Riddick"" tried to get too fancy, ""Riddick"" and ""Pitch Black"" proved that less is more.""Riddick"" to me is a tale of two movies. The opening moments of the film find Riddick stranded on a sun-scorched planet and find him struggling to survive his wounds, the elements and the planets creatures. The first half of the movie, while simple and less eventful, is the most interesting part. As Riddick explores and uses his instincts and survival skills to stay alive, I was completely invested and enjoying a good old fashion science fiction adventure.  Later on, mercenaries join the story as they come after Riddick for the bounty on his head.The addition of more people to the story didn't lessen the film by any means. In fact, it just pushed the movie into a different direction and it was also very interesting. What did lessen the film though, was a collage of terrible dialogue, silliness and character motivations and personalities that changed from scene to scene.  I was completely enjoying the film and was prepared to call this the surprise hit of the near-summer, until the creators failed to proofread the final third of the film.A vicious mercenary named Santana is after Riddick's head and he is vicious, except for when he's being punched in the face by the one girl in the movie or if the scene calls for him to be comic relief. A silly kicking a sword scene served no purpose except for the creators to do something new and gruesome and it was so silly it made the audience laugh. Finally, a bold prediction by Riddick as he's chained up basically spelled out the entire finale of the film, including that the one girl in the film would be straddling him at the end. From that point on, as I watched each one of Riddick's predictions come true, I couldn't stop thinking about the 'straddling' part of his story.""Riddick"" could have been good, or even great, but the filmmakers tried overtly to make things fun about halfway through the movie, not realizing that the movie was already fun. We were there. We were beside Riddick and his ability to friend a wild dog despite the dogs nature.

While Chronicles of Riddick will always be my favorite, borrowing elements (nicely) from David Lynch's Dune, this film seems a bit more like the original prequel (Pitch Black), but with a bigger budget, and with plot points that connect the three films.Without giving any spoilers away, Riddick finds himself on another harsh planet, working both with and against two teams of mercenaries.  Vin Diesel is the only guy who can play this role.  He really gets into it, alike a classical, method actor.  His facial expressions are wide-ranging and suit the various aspects of the plot.  He retains the glowing eyes/infrared vision from the rest of the series.  It's a thrilling ride with a lot of innovative creatures and plot twists.Also, where Chronicles of Riddick borrowed heavily from Dune, this film takes quite a few elements from the Aliens movies (Alien and Aliens (the sequel, which was excellent).It's a thrilling ride, innovative, and simply kick ass.My only two qualms with the film are1) The endng&#8211;I watched it digital download as soon as it was out, but the blu-ray, Director's Cut version has an alternate ending.  I'd like to see that without buying/renting it again.2) The Title &#8211; &#34;Riddick&#34; &#8211; I feel like they went the safe route and called it Riddiick, when it really is the third film in the series.  They could have given it a better/more aggressive name given that it was the third film.  I feel like calling it Riddick played it safe for audiences, when it really was the third title in the series.  But, you take what you can get.

They waste only a few minutes to bridge the gap between Chronicles and this installment.Once again, Twohy creates a fantastic world he doesn't allow us to fully appreciate.  It's either dark or distant; very little time is spent on middle ground before the clowns (bodies in waiting) descend on the big lug in the form of not one but two ships loaded with professional mercenaries (Vin and a cast of nobodies).  To complicate matters, one of the mercenaries is the father of that fake cop from the first film (the drug addict who wanted to use the girl Jack as bait).  How we're supposed to remember that requires a lot of devotion to all things Riddick.  It's ancient history and a bit late to be starting a grudge match.In this movie, there's some but not enough monsters (a wide assortment would be greatly appreciated).  The dialog is ludicrous (and not helped by Vin's bored monotone drone...........""you are getting sleepy, sleepy, sleepy"").  It's also impossible to root for someone when they're all psychos.  But I did like the jackal-beast-puppy.  As for the closing debate, is Vaako dead or alive or both................who cares?  That wouldn't be the follow-up that I'd like to see.

A subsequent viewing looked a lot better to me. But I'm still surprised it sprouted not one but two sequels. The latest ""Riddick"" is more like ""Pitch Black"" than ""The Chronicles of Riddick.""Here's the scoop. Riddick comes to on some unforgiving planet. He's got a compound fracture on one leg and a multitude of bruises and whatnot. He's also surrounded by creatures who look at him as though he's their next meal. He puts himself back together and activates a beacon at an outpost that draws the attention of two sets of bounty hunters. They want his hyde. He wants one of their ships. A storm brews that will awaken more monsters and make the two parties dependent upon one another.This is a somewhat different approach in that we see a Riddick that isn't always on top off things. An adversary gets the jump on him which is how we come to see him in his beat up state at the beginning of the flick. It's also more leisurely paced that the twp previous outings. Twohy takes time when letting Riddick mend himself, settle down and then domesticate one of the local canines. But this is some nasty stuff. I actually had to turn my head a couple of times, like when he puts his leg back together and again when he immunizes himself against the venom of one of the indigenous nasties. But when the bounty hunters arrive we see the old Riddick who is always a step ahead of his foes and it's fun. Twohy did a nice job with the hunters. They are better written than one usually finds in this kind of movie. The one odd exception was Bokeem Woodbine's character.  He was little more than a sketch and gets killed in a rather unceremonious fashion. Katee Sackhoff, of Star Trek fame, is on hand as a butt kicking sharp shooter who gets warm for Riddick's form. But it's all pretty cool. Riddick gets to do what he does best, which is to dispense people. And the tenuous bond he forms with the leader of one of the hunter groups plays pretty well.This is no great flick by any means, but for those who like the franchise, or this kind of movie in general, it delivers the goods in spades.",4,Beau-Coup Goo and Blood,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,2206,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'director', 'David', 'Twohy', 'best', 'work', 'subsequent', 'viewing', 'looked', 'lot', 'better', ""'m"", 'still', 'surprised', 'sprouted', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'sequels', 'latest', 'Riddick', 'more', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', 'Here', 'scoop', 'Riddick', 'unforgiving', 'planet', 'got', 'compound', 'fracture', 'one', 'leg', 'multitude', 'bruises', 'whatnot', 'also', 'surrounded', 'creatures', 'who', 'look', 'next', 'meal', 'back', 'together', 'beacon', 'outpost', 'attention', 'two', 'sets', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'want', 'hyde', 'one', 'ships', 'storm', 'brews', 'will', 'awaken', 'more', 'monsters', 'make', 'two', 'parties', 'dependent', 'one', 'another.This', 'somewhat', 'different', 'approach', 'see', 'Riddick', ""n't"", 'always', 'top', 'off', 'things', 'adversary', 'jump', 'how', 'come', 'see', 'beat', 'up', 'state', 'beginning', 'flick', 'also', 'more', 'leisurely', 'paced', 'twp', 'previous', 'outings', 'Twohy', 'time', 'when', 'letting', 'Riddick', 'mend', 'settle', 'down', 'then', 'domesticate', 'one', 'local', 'canines', 'nasty', 'stuff', 'actually', 'had', 'turn', 'head', 'couple', 'times', 'when', 'leg', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'when', 'venom', 'one', 'indigenous', 'nasties', 'when', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'arrive', 'see', 'old', 'Riddick', 'who', 'always', 'step', 'ahead', 'foes', 'fun', 'Twohy', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'hunters', 'are', 'better', 'written', 'one', 'usually', 'kind', 'movie', 'one', 'odd', 'exception', 'was', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', 'character', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'sketch', 'killed', 'rather', 'unceremonious', 'fashion', 'Katee', 'Sackhoff', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fame', 'hand', 'butt', 'kicking', 'sharp', 'shooter', 'who', 'warm', 'Riddick', 'form', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Riddick', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'dispense', 'people', 'tenuous', 'bond', 'leader', 'one', 'hunter', 'groups', 'pretty', 'well.This', 'great', 'flick', 'means', 'who', 'like', 'franchise', 'kind', 'movie', 'general', 'goods', 'spades']",N/A

It starts off slow and laborious until other characters are introduced. Then it does get a bit interesting. The 2 groups, which are bounty hunters, have their own agenda that does not become clear until later on. The characters are not developed enough and are bumped off rather quickly. There is only a small sequence referring back to the necromongers, which I think was a mistake. This feature tries to stand on its own, but, I think it fails. Where have the previous villains gone? What about the other characters in the prior movies, a back story would have helped. And the creatures that were designed for this slaughterfest were unimpressive. The best movie was the first, original and well written and introduced us to Riddick. The second one was a big extravaganza with a lot of visuals, but with less impact than the first.

301703,ADWQPR0LJD4J,6302219205,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[2, 3]","After nearly a 10 year gap between films, many were wondering if we really needed a sequel to &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick.&#34; The 2004 follow-up to &#34;Pitch Black&#34; veered off from the simple &#34;fight-to-survive&#34; scenario and took us into a world overstuffed with CGI razzle dazzle. What would Vin Diesel and Director Dave Twohy do with the third installment in the franchise, simply titled &#34;Riddick?&#34;What they've done is return the lead character to what he does best. I can't completely say this is a good thing. Riddick is a survivor. Whether you think him to be good or bad, the guy has a way of saving himself while &#34;accidently&#34; saving others at the same time. Strange thing is he's always rescuing people he doesn't even care about.Director/Writer David Twohy has found a way to mash together elements of &#34;Castaway&#34; and &#34;Robinson Crusoe on Mars&#34; with &#34;Aliens&#34; and &#34;Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation.&#34; In the first part of the film, the title character is banished from the city of the Necromongers. He's making his way solo through the desert fighting off all sorts of alien beasts. The second half has Riddick trapped in an abandoned outpost with a group of mercenaries and bounty hunters while fending off water monsters that have surrounded the motley bunch.The CGI and practical effects in &#34;Riddick&#34; aren't so bad. They're a lot easier to stomach than what we were served up in &#34;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.&#34; The visual effects are scaled way back from what we saw in &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick.&#34;You can tell Vin Diesel loves the character of Riddick. He fully embraces the role and savors every moment onscreen. Katee Sackhoff portrays one of the bounty hunters like she's playing a grimier version of Starbuck from &#34;Battlestar Galactica.&#34;The DVD version of &#34;Riddick&#34; only includes the theatrical version. The Blu-ray has an unrated version which I haven't had a chance to watch. Special features for the DVD include two featurettes entitled &#34;Vin's Riddick&#34; and &#34;Meet the Mercs.&#34; &#34;Riddick: Blindsided&#34; is a motion comic filling in the gap between &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick&#34; and &#34;Riddick.&#34; I don't really know why this is necessary, seeing how the beginning of the film already does a lot of that.&#34;Riddick&#34; is rated R for strong violence, language, and some sexual content/nudity. The only nudity is an extremely brief and very unnecessary shot of Katee Sackhoff in the shower. The rest is just sci-fi gore and bounty hunters cussing like sailors.For the most part, &#34;Riddick&#34; gives the viewer a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. The survivalist beginning of the movie does keep it from completely falling into retread territory. However, I'm still pretty sure it wasn't the sequel people wanted from this franchise. I can't tell you exactly what I wanted from it, but it was something different from this.",3,"""Riddick"" Returns in Disappointing Sequel",1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,2992,"['nearly', '10', 'year', 'gap', 'films', 'many', 'were', 'wondering', 'really', 'needed', 'sequel', '34', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick.', '34', '2004', 'follow-up', '34', 'Pitch', 'Black', '34', 'veered', 'simple', '34', 'fight-to-survive', '34', 'scenario', 'took', 'world', 'overstuffed', 'CGI', 'razzle', 'dazzle', 'What', 'would', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Director', 'Dave', 'Twohy', 'do', 'third', 'installment', 'franchise', 'simply', 'titled', '34', 'Riddick', '34', 'What', ""'ve"", 'done', 'return', 'lead', 'character', 'what', 'best', 'ca', ""n't"", 'completely', 'say', 'good', 'thing', 'Riddick', 'survivor', 'think', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'guy', 'way', 'saving', '34', 'accidently', '34', 'saving', 'others', 'same', 'time', 'Strange', 'thing', 'always', 'rescuing', 'people', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'about.Director/Writer', 'David', 'Twohy', 'found', 'way', 'mash', 'together', 'elements', '34', 'Castaway', '34', '34', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'Mars', '34', '34', 'Aliens', '34', '34', 'Starship', '2', 'Hero', 'Federation.', '34', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'title', 'character', 'banished', 'city', 'Necromongers', 'making', 'way', 'solo', 'desert', 'fighting', 'off', 'sorts', 'alien', 'beasts', 'second', 'half', 'Riddick', 'trapped', 'abandoned', 'outpost', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'fending', 'off', 'water', 'monsters', 'have', 'surrounded', 'motley', 'bunch.The', 'CGI', 'practical', 'effects', '34', 'Riddick', '34', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'lot', 'easier', 'stomach', 'what', 'were', 'served', 'up', '34', 'Hobbit', 'Desolation', 'Smaug.', '34', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'scaled', 'way', 'back', 'what', 'saw', '34', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick.', '34', 'can', 'tell', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'character', 'Riddick', 'fully', 'role', 'savors', 'moment', 'onscreen', 'Katee', 'Sackhoff', 'one', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'playing', 'grimier', 'version', 'Starbuck', '34', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica.', '34', 'DVD', 'version', '34', 'Riddick', '34', 'only', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Blu-ray', 'unrated', 'version', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'Special', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', 'two', 'featurettes', 'entitled', '34', 'Vin', 'Riddick', '34', '34', 'Meet', 'Mercs.', '34', '34', 'Riddick', 'Blindsided', '34', 'motion', 'comic', 'filling', 'gap', '34', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', '34', '34', 'Riddick.', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'necessary', 'seeing', 'how', 'beginning', 'film', 'already', 'lot', 'that.', '34', 'Riddick', '34', 'rated', 'R', 'strong', 'violence', 'language', 'sexual', 'content/nudity', 'only', 'nudity', 'extremely', 'brief', 'very', 'unnecessary', 'shot', 'Katee', 'Sackhoff', 'shower', 'rest', 'just', 'sci-fi', 'gore', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'cussing', 'most', 'part', '34', 'Riddick', '34', 'viewer', 'sense', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'survivalist', 'beginning', 'movie', 'keep', 'completely', 'falling', 'retread', 'territory', 'However', ""'m"", 'still', 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'sequel', 'people', 'wanted', 'franchise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'was', 'something', 'different']",N/A

301712,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,6302219205,FNDNreview,"[155, 177]","If you're a diehard Vin Diesel fan, then you probably remember him even for his lesser known roles in films that include Saving Private Ryan, Boiler Room, and Knockaround Guys.  But, the rest of us have come to know Diesel in basically two roles and two roles only:  Dominic Toretto in The Fast and the Furious franchise and Richard B. Riddick in the Riddick franchise.  Depending on how you feel about these two particular franchises - odds are that's how you judge whether you like or dislike his acting choices, which have largely included the role of the thug or tough guy.  Regardless, The Fast and the Furious franchise quickly lost its flavor without Diesel involved, eventually leading him to disappointing and lackluster roles in films, such as The Pacifier and Man Apart.  Eventually, Diesel reclaimed his role in the Fast franchise over the course of three more sequels - not to mention his fame.  And, much like Sylvester Stallone with Rocky and Rambo, Diesel hasn't forgotten the character that put him on the map.  It's been nearly 10 years since Diesel played the role of Riddick, but after a lengthy wait - the saga of the shiny-eyed convict finally continues in the second sequel (unless you count Dark Fury, then it would be the third sequel), simply titled - Riddick.David Twohy (Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick) is back to direct Riddick, starring Vin Diesel as Richard B. Riddick - a convict, last seen in The Chronicles of Riddick, had just conquered the Necromonger Empire.  However, it was only a matter of time before Riddick was betrayed by his underling, Vaako (Karl Urban).  Riddick attempts to return home, but is instead marooned on a desolate planet by the Necromongers - and must once again ward off not one, but two groups of mercenaries looking to collect the bounty on his head.  At the same time, a storm is approaching that will once again allow a massive race of predators to unleash maximum carnage.  Jordi Moll&agrave;, Matt Nable, Dave Bautista, and Katee Sackhoff also star in supporting roles.Personally, nothing pleases me more than when a franchise has the same director for all of its films.  As a devoted fan of these flicks, I believe it's of the utmost importance to establish and maintain a rock-solid continuity. It appeases the fans that have stuck with the franchise and makes the entirety of the story flow in ways that most franchises just don't care enough to sustain.  More often than not, it's brutally (but not always) obvious when a film is shot by one director, and then said director hands off the reigns to someone else.  A recent example would be Jon Favreau leaving his directing duties on Iron Man 1 & 2, giving way to Shane Black in Iron Man 3 - who obviously has a completely different style of directing than Favreau.  In any event, director David Twohy is back in the director's chair for Riddick - his third stint (out of a possible three) in the Riddick saga.  His imagination and fingerprints are all over this franchise, from the development stages to the plot direction - all of which have contributed to this pure, high-octane series of action sci-fi films.It seems relatively easy to say any given role is the best for an actor.  Since I already used the Iron Man reference, a perfect example would be me saying Iron Man 3 is Robert Downy Jr.'s best performance to date.  Some people might agree with that assessment, but it's the same character being portrayed by the same person over the course of several films, so why does it really matter?  That's the rule of thumb I'm applying to Vin Diesel in the Riddick films.  Without a shadow of a doubt, Riddick is Vin Diesel's best work.  In this case, that's not a very large stretch to say since Diesel has only had a handful of characters in his tenure as an actor.  Riddick could be comparable to Dominic Toretto, but Riddick is much more a savage character - active, deadly, and a character that says what he means and means what he says.  I suppose that's a completely backwards way of saying he's a total badass.  If you've seen the first two flicks, then Riddick is more of the same - meaning immensely enjoyable in terms of overall entertainment quality.While Diesel thrives in his role, there are still some bothersome issues about this film.  First and foremost, Riddick reflects Pitch Black too much for its own good - visually and plot-wise.  Don't get me wrong, Pitch Black was a quality flick with a pleasing plot and plenty of action, but there's still a moderate amount of disappointment surrounding the fact that after waiting nearly 10 years for more Riddick, the film is a rough rearrangement of the first film.  Speaking of disappointment - it's also a major disappointment that Karl Urban only shows up for a matter of seconds.  You heard it - he has nothing more than a brief cameo.  There's an endless amount of potential lost with writing a script that didn't include Urban, especially since he's established himself as a top name in Hollywood.  Since his role in The Chronicles of Riddick, he has ballooned into a near household name - but I suppose a brief appearance is better than no appearance at all.  Hopefully, Riddick will accumulate worldwide success and before long, Riddick will be knocking on Vaako's door in a not-so-distant sequel.Overall, Riddick is chock-full of memorable moments that will have Riddick fans screaming to the rafters with joy (present company included).  Recent news reports have cited the difficulties Diesel endured financially to make this sequel, so he should be commended for making a film for his fans - especially since there are plenty of actors out there that would have passed on such a gamble.  In my opinion, Riddick pays off with dividends in terms of action, CGI visuals, acting, characters, and complete quality of the end product. Even more impressive is the fact this movie was filmed on a reduced budget of $38 million, compared to its predecessor, which cost more than $100 million.  Obviously, this film warrants a view, but there are strings attached - and this is where Riddick might hit a snag in the ""success"" department.  The major drawback is that it's been 13 years since Pitch Black was released, and 9 years since its sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick, was released.  Naturally, that means if you haven't seen these two films, you'll need to watch them before watching Riddick - as there are heavy details from both films that tie into Riddick.  But, if you're caught up on these flicks already, you're good to go.GRADE:  BFNDNreview.com",4,"Diesel at his best in the sci-fi sequel, 'Riddick'",1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,6556,"[""'re"",

Activating an emergency beacon alerts two ships: one carrying a new breed of mercenary, the other captained by a man from Riddick's past.  most of  the Actors do a Great job with their performances and the movie is well shot.  The movie ends like it should and i highly recommend it to those who like Vin Diesel  and or like Drama Movies.  I give it a 7 Stars out of ten or 4 Stars out of Five.

Riddick had been left for dead on a hostile planet and we get to see some flashbacks and some really legit survival scenarios. Now up to the point where he calls for help, things where looking prettygood, granted I was disappointed that they didn't proceed with a Necromonger related storyline, and then we get the nextbadly paced hour and a half of this movie.The movie starts rehashing plot points from the first movie to an unapologetic degree. They're on a planet, they wantRiddick dead, a once in a blue moon event is about to occur, a lot of predators are going to come out, and they haveto go and retrieve power nodes for their ships, and after a few of them survive, it ends with each ship flying off into space.I kid you not; it's just Pitch Black with modern special effects. Now after Chronicles, I was sitting there just blown away by theending; it was unforeseen and made me jones for the third installment, but my excitement was shot dead completelyin this film; needless to say, I won't be expecting a fourth installment to the series.So what does that mean for the bottom line?

Instead of being a mere continuation of the 2nd Riddick it makes a gentle (?) break and returns to what made Vin Diesel a big star in this franchise. A number of people didn't like the 2nd Riddick film. I really enjoyed that one too. Still, I believe that that particular plot had run its course and now we get Vin Diesel at his best, a convicted , hunted, criminal with a certain sense of nobility and character amidst a dystopian world of horror where humans fight each other, Riddick and monsters deadlier than Pitch Black. Have fun with this. It is entertainment at its best. I give it a solid 4 stars. 5 stars I am very stingy with.

301757,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,6302219205,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[0, 0]","Let me start off by stating that I absolutely LOVE David Twohy's PITCH BLACK. It's not wholly original, but what it does with the genre, how it explores certain archetypes and how it creates one of the great anti-heroes of Sci-Fi are totally captivating. I'm also a fan of THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK, but much less so. It did a lot towards building the universe around the characters, but it went too high-concept. RIDDICK is very much a return to its roots kind of sequel, and again it starts off in such a compelling way and builds suspense incredibly effectively, but loses a lot of momentum when it goes for the big finale.Left for dead by Vaako (Karl Urban in nothing more than a cameo) and the Necromongers from CHRONICLES, Richard Riddick (Diesel) is stranded on a planet that he was hoping was his home planet of Furya, but is a desolate waste of a planet where everything living is trying to kill him. The first act of this film is Riddick trying to survive this harsh environment, and aside from some issues with the CG jackals, it works rather brilliantly. Then he finds a mercenary outpost long-abandoned and triggers an alert that will send mercs to once again try and capture and/or kill him, but he just wants a ship that'll take him off-planet. Two very different squads of mercs arrive with very different reasons to take him in (portrayed by the likes of Katee Sackhoff, Bokeem Woodbine, and Dave Bautista just to name a few). When they arrive, Riddick starts putting his plans into motion, killing and creeping up on the mercs like the quiet villain in a horror film while the mercs start panicking. And things are very interesting and scary and cool, including a reveal about one of the mercs that goes back to the first film. But when the creepy-crawlie giant-scorpion-like aliens start to surround them (brought on this time by a torrential downpour rather than the eclipse of the first film), the film starts to lose its tether to what makes Riddick and his adversaries interesting, and therefore, the film starts to become less interesting.From a character standpoint, most of the mercs are archetypes that Twohy puts a spin on. From righteous to religious to violent to hyper-ultra-violent. And in the midst of all this is poor Katie Sackhoff. Her character is initially cool, and aside from her original presentation as a lesbian (which is a cool idea to have that represented in a futuristic sci-fi action-horror), she is absolutely competent in her work. Until near the end of the film, it seems that Riddick intends to, for lack of a better term, cure her of her sexual preference because he's Riddick and he can do anything. That REALLY made me angry. I'm not saying that these films are intended to be the new zeitgeist of sci-fi action-horror, but PITCH BLACK and CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK did actually take the time to go beyond the adolescent male fantasy zone. Also, Riddick seems to get a little too touchy-feely with his more primal impulses towards his potential captors/killers at the end as well.Now the effects. There's almost nothing that pulls me out of a sci-fi film faster than unconvincing effects, practical or digital. Now, I know that this isn't AVATAR; it doesn't have a $200 million budget, but there are effects houses that can still do really good work on the &#34;cheap&#34;, but whoever worked on RIDDICK isn't one of those. Both the jackals and the scorpion things from a design perspective look really cool, but the digital work just isn't fluid and realistic enough to make them seem truly cool on-screen. However, the climax of the film helps these creatures simply by the fact they are now surrounded by darkness, so not as much detail needs to be given.Still, for two out of three acts, this is a five-star movie. But RIDDICK loses points at the end.",4,"The first two acts of this film are pretty awesome... the third act, not so much.",1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,3806,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'stating', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'David', 'Twohy', 'PITCH', 'BLACK', 'not', 'wholly', 'original', 'what', 'genre', 'how', 'certain', 'archetypes', 'how', 'one', 'great', 'anti-heroes', 'Sci-Fi', 'are', 'totally', 'captivating', ""'m"", 'also', 'fan', 'THE', 'CHRONICLES', 'OF', 'RIDDICK', 'much', 'less', 'so', 'did', 'lot', 'building', 'universe', 'characters', 'went', 'too', 'high-concept', 'RIDDICK', 'very', 'much', 'return', 'roots', 'kind', 'sequel', 'again', 'such', 'compelling', 'way', 'builds', 'suspense', 'incredibly', 'effectively', 'lot', 'momentum', 'when', 'big', 'finale.Left', 'dead', 'Vaako', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'nothing', 'more', 'cameo', 'Necromongers', 'CHRONICLES', 'Richard', 'Riddick', 'Diesel', 'stranded', 'planet', 'was', 'hoping', 'was', 'home', 'planet', 'Furya', 'desolate', 'waste', 'planet', 'where', 'everything', 'living', 'trying', 'kill', 'first', 'act', 'film', 'Riddick', 'trying', 'survive', 'harsh', 'environment', 'aside', 'issues', 'CG', 'jackals', 'rather', 'brilliantly', 'Then', 'mercenary', 'outpost', 'long-abandoned', 'triggers', 'alert', 'will', 'send', 'mercs', 'once', 'again', 'try', 'capture', 'and/or', 'kill', 'just', 'ship', ""'ll"", 'take', 'off-planet', 'Two', 'very', 'different', 'squads', 'mercs', 'arrive', 'very', 'different', 'reasons', 'take', 'portrayed', 'likes', 'Katee', 'Sackhoff', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', 'Dave', 'Bautista', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'When', 'arrive', 'Riddick', 'putting', 'plans', 'motion', 'killing', 'creeping', 'up', 'mercs', 'quiet', 'villain', 'horror', 'film', 'mercs', 'start', 'panicking', 'things', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'scary', 'cool', 'including', 'reveal', 'one', 'mercs', 'back', 'first', 'film', 'when', 'creepy-crawlie', 'giant-scorpion-like', 'aliens', 'start', 'surround', 'brought', 'time', 'torrential', 'downpour', 'rather', 'eclipse', 'first', 'film', 'film', 'lose', 'tether', 'what', 'Riddick', 'adversaries', 'interesting', 'therefore', 'film', 'become', 'less', 'character', 'standpoint', 'most', 'mercs', 'are', 'Twohy', 'spin', 'righteous', 'religious', 'violent', 'hyper-ultra-violent', 'midst', 'poor', 'Katie', 'Sackhoff', 'character', 'initially', 'cool', 'aside', 'original', 'presentation', 'lesbian', 'cool', 'idea', 'have', 'represented', 'futuristic', 'sci-fi', 'action-horror', 'absolutely', 'competent', 'work', 'end', 'film', 'Riddick', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'cure', 'sexual', 'preference', 'Riddick', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'REALLY', 'made', 'angry', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'films', 'are', 'intended', 'be', 'new', 'zeitgeist', 'sci-fi', 'action-horror', 'PITCH', 'BLACK', 'CHRONICLES', 'OF', 'RIDDICK', 'did', 'actually', 'take', 'time', 'go', 'adolescent', 'male', 'fantasy', 'zone', 'Also', 'Riddick', 'get', 'little', 'too', 'touchy-feely', 'more', 'primal', 'impulses', 'potential', 'captors/killers', 'end', 'well.Now', 'effects', 'almost', 'nothing', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'faster', 'unconvincing', 'effects', 'practical', 'digital', 'Now', 'know', ""n't"", 'AVATAR', ""n't"", 'have', '200', 'million', 'budget', 'are', 'effects', 'houses', 'can', 'still', 'do', 'really', 'good', 'work', '34', 'cheap', '34', 'whoever', 'worked', 'RIDDICK', ""n't"", 'one', 'jackals', 'scorpion', 'things', 'design', 'perspective', 'look', 'really', 'cool', 'digital', 'work', 'just', ""n't"", 'fluid', 'realistic', 'enough', 'make', 'seem', 'truly', 'cool', 'on-screen', 'However', 'climax', 'film', 'creatures', 'simply', 'fact', 'are', 'now', 'surrounded', 'darkness', 'so', 'not', 'much', 'detail', 'needs', 'be', 'given.Still', 'two', 'three', 'acts', 'five-star', 'movie', 'RIDDICK', 'points', 'end']",N/A

You know how some people have to put on more cologne each day just so they can smell it, while the rest of us gag? That is baseline tolerance.Now let's talk about Computer Generated Imaging: Starting with the 1973 Yul Brynner oater ""Westworld"" and decades later ""Avatar"" in 2009, we have seen so much CGI, we gag. Hollywood can't seem to smell it yet and I admit some of it is dazzling, but how about a good script? Lots of cologne can't mask a failure to bathe, nor can lots of CGI mask a lame script. Which brings me to this third installment of a third Vin Diesel franchise (""Fast and Furious"" and ""xXx"" are two others); it has brilliant CGI but some of the dialog made me wonder how the actors kept a straight face...Here they are:* Vin Diesel (""The Pacifier"") is Riddick, the legendary loner who sets his own broken leg (don't ask).* Karl Urban (""RED"") in a 30-second bait and switch. Do NOT go if you are expecting to see Mr. U. in an actual role...* Jordi Moll&agrave; (""Knight and Day"") is Santana, the bounty hunter. To him, Riddick is worth more dead than alive.* Matt Nable (""Killer Elite"") is Boss Johns, seeking Riddick to learn more about his son's death.The story? Left for dead on a sun-baked planet, our hero fights against all odds and plots revenge. That pretty much covers it.This has some of the best CGI work I have seen to date, the production design is wonderful, the photography is masterful, the story is basic but involving, and like other Diesel outings, includes an anti-drug bit.

Like many, the second film really threw me.  It wasn't that I thought it was a bad film, it was passable.  It felt out of place, not highlighting the aspects of the title character as the first film did.  In a sense, too much fluff, not enough substance.  So, when the third film was hinted at, I had mixed feelings.This one returns the character to the basics, which I think was a good thing.  Small cast, functional but not overdone locations, identifiable threat, sprinkled with a nice blend of moments of humanity and violence.  You can do so much more with a simple approach than with grand scenes full of CGI, explosions, and thousands of extras running about.  I think this film is a good example of that kind of movie.Personally, I thought him raising a pet was an interesting touch that kept him human without having him loss any of his 'badass' persona.  While the film does showcase a lot of the title character's strengths, it also keeps him grounded by weak moments, such as him dealing with sever injury or reacting to extreme moments in a softer light (the previously mentioned pet and the merc prisoner being two examples).This is the kind of film I wished the second film would have been, and if they do more in this tone, I certainly would continue to support the franchise.Buy it, rent it, stream it.

When he activates an emergency beacon that alerts two ships he must confront a band of mercenaries and the other captained by a man from Riddick's past.I have been a Vin Diesel fan for a while and like the coolness he brings to his roles and I liked the original Chronicles movie and while I was eager to see this new installment, however I felt disappointed in this sequel.  Vin Diesel was solid as his character bringing that same cool alter ego that he has with the role but even he couldn't save the storyline.  As other have said this movie seems a bit like the movie Pitch Black.  The movie starts very slow as well with very little happening other than Riddick battling the elements and some weird poorly designed CGI beasts.  The special effects and CGI part of the movie seem to be suffering the effects of a lower budget and it shows from the beasts to the flying &#34;hogs&#34; as they call them.  But I could have dealt with just the poor CGI but the story line was really the weak point here.  With the first half mainly concerned about Riddick's relationship with his alien dog and the second half more concerned about a battle of 11 to one and the last man standing kind of thing and turns into something that lacks originality in story and strays from a story with a point to one where there is nothing but Riddick showing he is superior with the goal of eliminating all the mercenaries and then goes to save them all against the beasts.As for me, a totally unsatisfying storyline for such a good character. This movie could have been so much more, Vin Diesel does all he can but with the lackluster script there is only so much you can do.

301835,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,6302219205,K. Reynolds,"[1, 2]","VIN DIESEL has skills. In &#8220;Vin&#8217;s Riddick,&#8221; a bonus feature available on both Blu-ray and DVD, executive producer Samantha Vincent says, &#8220;He started his career as a writer, director, producer, and actor. So wearing these multiple hats is something he&#8217;s done from the beginning.&#8221;Director/co-writer David Twohy says, &#8220;Vin always had a sense of himself as something bigger than what he was when I cast him in &#8216;Pitch Black,&#8217;&#8221; his first lead role. In &#8220;Chronicles of Riddick,&#8221; Diesel became a producer and, by the third film, he had secured the rights from Universal Studios. Fans wanted the Riddick story to continue after &#8220;Chronicles&#8221; and the success of Diesel&#8217;s other franchise, &#8220;Fast & Furious.&#8221;Vin himself tells us that, even 10 years after &#8220;Chronicles,&#8221; Facebook fans were saying, &#8220;If we all gave you $10 each, you could make it yourself.&#8221;Which is, essentially, what he did in &#8220;Riddick,&#8221; bringing his anti-hero back to the screen and his more vulnerable, hard-scrabble roots for an adventure we can sink our teeth into.Kind of what we imagine happens to the alien vulture that swoops down on our battered hero in the opening. Comparisons to &#8220;Pitch Black&#8221; are certain. However, the rough and ready look is easier to believe in than the polish of &#8220;Chronicles.&#8221; The first part of the movie has no dialogue. Once the king of the Necromancers, Riddick has been left for dead on a desert planet. He&#8217;s in bad shape, with a broken leg, no supplies and no shelter. He digs himself out from under an avalanche to become the target of critters who&#8217;d like to make him into Riddick chow. But this John Wayne of the space age has other plans.We follow Riddick&#8217;s healing and discovery of other cave-dwelling, venomous mud monsters. Around that time we also meet the scene stealer, an &#8220;escape artist&#8221; dog-like creature. As seen in the previews, he&#8217;s a tiger-jackal mix native that Riddick rescues as a puppy. There&#8217;s no sentiment on Riddick&#8217;s part; he needs something to experiment on to get past the cave monsters. Still, their scenes together are some of the best in the show, and it&#8217;s the dog who alerts Riddick to the planet&#8217;s hidden danger.Next thing we know, Riddick is at a mercenary maintenance station sending a beacon to let the bounty hunters know where to find him. Two teams arrive &#8211;and both quickly learn this will be no simple pick up; Riddick promises to let them leave as long as they give him a ship so he can depart himself. The pace slows as the mercs introduce themselves, but starts escalating again once Riddick begins picking them off.Both the Blu-ray and DVD are loaded with extras, although the Blu-ray gets great exclusives, such as an unrated director&#8217;s cut along with the theatrical release. The director&#8217;s cut adds 8 minutes, including an extended ending.Extras included on both discs are &#8220;Meet the Mercs,&#8221; which provides background on the actors and how they created their parts. Most interesting is learning how a sequence was created for Keri Hilson, who auditioned for the part of Dahl, a role that went to Katee Sackhoff, formerly of the new &#8220;Battlestar Galactica.&#8221; Along with &#8220;Vin&#8217;s Riddick,&#8221; there&#8217;s &#8220;Riddick: Blindsided,&#8221; a short motion-animated film showing an alternate beginning, some of which is used in the film.Blu-ray exclusives feature &#8220;The World of Riddick,&#8221; demonstrating the technical world- and set-building details from Twohy, Vincent, production designer Joseph Nemec III, visual effects supervisor Gunnar Hansen, and director of photography David Eggby, who also worked on &#8220;Pitch Black.&#8221; Hansen says inspiration for the planet came from the Bisti Badlands of New Mexico, a haunting expanse of eroded rocks and plateaus hidden away in the San Juan Basin. It might remind some of Monument Valley, where John Houston shot many of his films. Bisti is protected land and Twohy&#8217;s crew was not allowed to shoot there. Still, comparison photos of the desert and scenes from &#8220;Riddick&#8217;s&#8221; world show how Bisti plays a significant role in creating the look of the film. We also see how they used Doberman Pinschers as stop-motion capture artists, puppets and CG as the basis for the jackal-dogs.&#8220;World of Riddick&#8221; also runs through the development of the mercenary stopover or maintenance station. It&#8217;s run by solar energy and has an abandoned military post-look. Life-size space ships were built for the set. It&#8217;s amazing to learn what can be done with Styrofoam, plywood, paint and special effects, but, from ships to sets, it all looks real.There&#8217;s more to learn in &#8220;Riddickian Tech,&#8221; especially about the &#8220;jet hogs&#8221; &#8211; terrific hover bikes who owe their grit to Harley Davidson. Nemic explains they used parts from a variety of things &#8211; turbine boosters, electronics, thrusters that work like those on a Harrier &#8211; to create a &#8220;retro jet cycle.&#8221; The bikes look like a collection of rusted nuts, bolts and turbines, with a seat similar to a Western saddle, and I want one.&#8220;The Twohy Touch&#8221; pulls it all together with an interview from the director on his approach to the film.None of the featurettes are much longer than 10 minutes, which goes to show extras don&#8217;t have to be hours-long to say what they need to in an interesting and memorable way. There&#8217;s no commentary, but do we really need one? What&#8217;s good is &#8220;Riddick&#8221; itself &#8211; a return to a gritty, action-filled space adventure and a hero we&#8217;re glad to see again.",5,Blu-ray exclusives showcase

This is how the story goes: When Riddick is left for dead on a lifeless planet, however, he realizes that he is not alone. With a storm due to hit the planet, Riddick activates an emergency beacon from an abandoned outpost on the planet. 2 ships respond to the beacon's signal, one of them a mercenary ship and the other ship, piloted by someone connected to Riddick's past.The cast led by Vin Diesel (also produced) (as Riddick) is great. The directing & story & screenplay by David Twohy is great.The music by Graeme Revell is great. The cinematography by David Eggby is great. The film editing by Tracy Adams is great. The casting by Anne McCarthy is great. The production design by Joseph C. Nemec III is great. The art direction by Jean-Andre Carriere is great. The set decoration by Daniel Carpentier, set dressings by Louis Frederic Denomme is great. The costume design by Simonetta Mariano is great. The special make-up effects by Adrien Morot is great. The special effects supervised by Ryal Cosgrove is great. The visual effects supervised by Tim Carras, Ryan Epp, Gunnar Hansen, Alain Lachance, Pierre-Simon Lebrun-Chaput, Nordin Rahhali, Ollie Rankin & Mathieu Raynault, coordinated by Ryan Burcham, Cynthia Carrier, Jonathan Cronk, Charles-David Deschenes, Sabrina Gagnon, Lauren Guerard, Amelie Marcoux, Laurel Montgomery, Jessica Newhouse-Smith, Svetlana Tesnes, Mathieu Tremblay & Kelly Wong is great. The stunts coordinated by Michael Scherer & fights coordinated by Guillermo Grispo is great.This is a great second sequel in the ""Riddick"" franchise, that is well-done and well-made.

We all have different movies we like and dislike. I just ask that you read my reasons behind my thoughts and consider the point of view I'm coming from. Note there are spoilers in this write-up.First, I adore the Riddick series up to the final movie, Riddick. I've seen Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick many, many times. I love Vin Diesel and his alpha-male character. In Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick, his relationship with Kyra, the subtlety of the situation, was great. There were so many aspects of these movies that shone. The sense of man-against-the-world. The nuances of the cultures. Judi Densch was super as Aereon, the neutral entity. Karl Urban as Vaako and Thandie Newton as his conniving wife were great. There were so many characters in here which filled out the environment. The special effects were cool. It was immensely satisfying to watch.So I went into this third version of Riddick with great anticipation.The plot is pared down. That's fine. I loved the first Pitch Black and that had a fairly simple plot. In fact, it was pretty much this plot. Riddick on a planet. Mercenaries out to grab him. Riddick takes them all on. Beasties. Riddick wins.Where the first two movies had superb writing and everything that happened cohesively made sense, many aspects of this one felt as if the writers took shortcuts and didn't bother to map out an overall scenario. Why would the bad guys drop Riddick on a planet which had a fully stocked mercenary base on it? Surely they knew the reputation of this guy. I know they intended to kill him - but still, you plan for all eventualities. Surely you drop him on a completely abandoned planet with NO chance of getting off. Why would the mercenaries build a base on this planet covered with death-creatures and not leave a large warning in the base to let people know this happens occasionally? You can't tell me with all their sci-fi scanning devices that they didn't notice the bodies beneath the sand. That's what mercenaries excel at - finding hiding bodies. There's situation after situation like this. The writers could easily have made minor tweaks so all of this made sense, but they didn't bother.I do love many of the special effects in this. The puppy was quite real feeling and had expressive body language. The creatures were appropriately threatening. But in other cases the sets felt cheezy. It was clearly them standing on a stage and not a real planet. Again, just a little bit more effort would have eliminated this problem.But the real issue - the one that has me just shaking my head in disbelief - has to do with the women in this.Again, I realize this is a fantasy. But look at the first two movies! Kyra was amazing. Aereon was great. Dame Vaako was great! These were fantasy women with grit and strength. They had to be, to live in this world. They helped Riddick then become even stronger, as he dealt with and interacted with these women.So, what do we have in this latest incarnation of Riddick?Women group 1: Four totally naked slave consorts that Riddick Fs every chance he can get. They were slaves ripped from their homeworld, forced against their will to become whores. Riddick doesn't care. He Fs them as much as he can until he gets taken away.Woman 2: Captured woman who is repeaetedly Fed by the &#34;bad&#34; mercenary group. She's shaking and traumatized by her ordeal. So she's released and shot in the back. The lead merc says he was getting too fond of her so he decided to kill her. I realize this is a way of showing these mercs are bad, but still. Repeatedly raped, traumatized woman forced to be a whore. Isn't this what we had in group 1 where Riddick was the culprit?Woman 3: Starbuck!! I adore Battlestar Galactica and Katee Sackhoff. I was just so thrilled that she was in this movie as Dahl. And then my joy turned to frustration. What is Katee's role in this? To be someone every other guy wants to F. We get a view of her naked breast and Riddick comments on her nipple color. Bad merc tries to rape her. Riddick boasts that by the end of the battle she'll beg him to F her, even though she turns away all the other men. Sure enough, at the end, she asks him to F her, and one of the last lines is about Riddick wanting her to keep her &#34;box&#34; warm for him. So he can F her some more.And that's it.Good God Almighty. That's the fantasy version of women? Whores that want it, whores that are raped, and tough women who resist other guys but the hero is so studly that she gives in and begs him for sex?It's not that the Riddick series has always been like this. The first two movies were great! Where in the world did this mentality come in? And even more concerning to me, why do so many viewers not even blink an eye that this is how women are shown? Do they think it normal that women are either whores, rape victims, or women who secretly crave a tough guy to take them? You could say that at least Katee fought off her rapist. Great. But there's still the very clear statement here, in pretty much every scene, that she is there for sex. Every guy just wants to F her, and eventually the hero will break her down and make her beg for it. That's her purpose in life, to be Fed.She's a superb fighter, a great sniper, and has many other strengths - but the attention she gets is solely about a guy stripping her naked and using her.Is this really the level our fantasy movies have sunk to? That women are solely sex dolls to be grabbed, used, and discarded? Maybe killed if they get in the way?Conan had Valeria, a tough-as-nails fighter who matched him. Madmartigan had Sorsha, amazing with a sword. Riddick has ... slave whores? And a &#34;warm box&#34;?This is a fantasy world men or women want? Why not fantasize about living on a planet with cyborg sex dolls?",2,SO Disappointed - I Adored the First Two Movies - Spoilers,1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,5877,"['realize', 'many', 'Riddick',

301865,A24KZBAAUTC83R,6302219205,Mace & Lacey Gannon,"[6, 10]","This is the only franchise we like this actor in. Fast 5 movies are stupid and his acting in them is terrible.But like some other actors who totally 'fit in' perfectly in a role, Riddick is perfect for Vin Diesel. Much like Blade was for Wesley Snipes. They just have that particular character inside them, fitting like a 2nd skin.For the life of us, we can't figure how a pretty solid B-movie like Pitch Black was better recieved by fans than the bigger and better Chronicles of Riddick. HUH?! They wanted it dumbed down more. Complained that there were not any monsters in the sequel. We'll take style over substance any day of the week. Chronicles of Riddick was awesome, and we will state right here that it was hands down one of the best science fiction action movies ever made.Now, after all of these years, we finally get Riddick. We went in hoping for the best, expecting a dumbed down version that the 'fans' yelled and cried they wanted, not the story-and-character-driven and much better special effects extravaganza that Chronicles was.Now, after seeing and thinking over this much anticipated 3rd installment, we have come to the conclusion that it at least wasn't the pile of crap most half-assed sci-fi small budget movies come out with. (And it was surely better than all the Fast 5 movies we ever saw!)For what it was, (Pitch Black 2, really!), Riddick was very enjoyable. Had more laughs than most comedies, (Hangover 2 & 3 anybody!), and had TONS of creature features for the 'dumbed down' fanbase that screamed for it. The cast was good for what storyline it had. Katie Sackoff's character could have really come off much better since she has the acting chops. But for what it was, a back to B-movie basics, due to those hordes of 'stupid fans' that didn't support the bigger and much better Chronicles, director Twohy and producer/actor Vin Diesel gave us at least a fun time at the movies.A good pulp sci-fi action/adventure is in our blood. So, basically, we did like the film. But would have much more like to've seen a richer film in which the sequel was leading us to. LOVED the beginning. With Riddick being stranded on a very hostile and creature-filled savage world. Twohy and Vin Diesel did a solid job here. We love dogs, so to have Riddick get himself an alien pet was a major kudos for animal lovers out there. You don't see this being done in sci-fi/fantasy movies.I think a movie staying in this form might have been even better, just having Riddick and alien dog friend living off the harsh and brutal savage planet. Maybe running into a race of alien cannibal beings. Instead of the usual Riddick battling mercs story. And we love mercenary books and movies! (Riddick 3?) We hope so.We really didn't have any major issues with this new movie, until the end. The ending was not bad, but left us wanting more, especially in terms of 'proper endings' go. We loved how the director and Vin connected the 1st movie with this one, but leaving a certain bounty hunter alive was a stretch. Riddick would not have done this. Nor would the merc father. Rather would have seen everybody die except for Riddick riding off into the far off reaches of space with just Katie Sackoff.But, as it is, we really enjoyed the action-filled adventure of this latest Riddick. His dark humor was great. Just like the previous movies, Riddick comes up with great one-liners that don't come off as eye-rolling stupidity. We also love that Riddick doesn't pander to the PG-13 rating that most do nowadays. We expect our Riddick to be hardcore R action and sexually charged. And this one was.

Plus the fact that he's not a clean cut hero makes him more fun to watch. This third film in the series didn't disappoint, it starts with him having to survive on a hostile planet with some nasty creatures and after a while, a cool pet.Eventually he finds a mercenary base that enables him to call off world, luring a ship of mercenaries after the bounty on his head. Two teams arrive, the first want him dead, the second (led by someone with a familiar name from the first film) wants him alive. Naturally Riddick cares for neither of those options but wants one of the ships so he can leave.The film ties off the connection with the second film quite quickly and returns to the format from the original, which gets my vote. Once again we have alien monsters hunting the humans (who are better equipped than those in Pitch black, not that it helps them much), the creatures are pretty cool. Nasty and alien looking, although I preferred the design of the creatures from Pitch Black, these do make suitable bad guys.Riddick is the star of the show of course, but the members of the two crews have their moments and for Battlestar fans there's Katy Sackoff as the token female. The pacing is good, the action starts quickly and keeps going through the film.

The plot also solid because it picks right up after the last Riddick.  It made sense.

Riddick is stranded on a desolate planet populated with large jackal like dogs, and scorpion like insect creatures who want to eat him ( literally). Later on in the film we add violent bounty hunters who merely want to collect his head in a box ( literally) for the ransom payoff, as the payoff is doubled if Riddick is dead. Oh yes Riddick must also deal with no food, no water and a broken leg. The amusement is seeing how Riddick handles on this.

301886,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,6302219205,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[5, 7]","I've been a fan of Riddick (Vin Diesel) since his debut, way back in &#34;Pitch Black&#34; when the glassy-eyed badass from the underworld of space first showed us that his streetfighting skills were more than a match for sound-sensing aliens.  Three films and five years later after the last installment, he's come full circle with a movie named merely &#34;Riddick.&#34;Where last we saw Riddick, he followed the Necromonger motto of &#34;you keep what you kill&#34; to its logical conclusion, which led to him killing the Lord Marshall and taking his place, Conan-style, on the throne. But it turns out Riddick didn't quite fulfill the oath required for the office, and with assassins lurking everywhere (particularly in his harem), things simply aren't fun anymore.  Riddick wants out, and strikes a deal with Commander Vaako (Karl Urban) to take him back to his homeworld of Furya (fans will remember Riddick is a Furyan, the last of his kind). Vaako gets to be Lord Marshall in exchange.  Sounds simple, right?It's perhaps no surprise that the Necromongers are not content to let Riddick walk off into the sunset.  Krone (Andreas Apergis), Vaako's right-hand man, tries to kill Riddick off.  And for a brief moment we see Riddick with the same superpowers the previous Lord Marshall had in the last act of the previous film.  Exactly how one acquires these powers (given that he didn't take the oath) is an open question -- as well as when he loses them.  But needless to say Riddick survives the betrayal at great personal cost on a very hostile planet that isn't Furya.Despite some leaps of logic, for the first half of the film &#34;Riddick&#34; is near perfection.  It's Riddick, being his badass self, against a host of vicious creatures, ranging from jackal-like canines to mud demons.  The mud demons are the most innovative part of the film, and Riddick's discovery of their ecology is part of the joy of &#34;Riddick.&#34;  His eventual friendship with a jackal beast even makes Riddick a likable Davy Crockett of outer space.Then everybody else shows up.  To be fair, Riddick invited them there, brazenly showing his face on a distress beacon to lure mercenaries with the intent of hijacking one of their ships.  It's at this point that &#34;Riddick&#34; takes a turn for the worse as every sci-fi macho stereotype shows up to strut and spit, mucking up the elegant beauty that was the first half of the film.The first group is a bunch of space pirates led by a filthy and violent fellow named Santana (Jordi Molla).  The second is a military-style operation led by the crisp Boss Johns (Matt Nable). It's of note that accompanying Johns' team is sniper Dahl (Katee Sackhoff).  Riddick proceeds to play a cat-and-mouse game with the mercenaries, offing them one by one, interspersed with some pretty bad dialogue in which Riddick laughs at his enemies and promises to do things to the women.There are some ties to the previous films, most specifically in Boss Johns' connecting to a character from &#34;Pitch Black.&#34; It's also worth noting that the religious figure here, instead of being Muslim, is firmly Christian -- and that's a shame, as &#34;Pitch Black&#34; was willing to differentiate its future with a non-European perspective.In a sense, that's the flaw of &#34;Riddick&#34;: there's a distinct string of misogyny running throughout -- at one point, Santana tries to rape Dahl but it's no big deal because she fights him off. The fact that &#34;Dahl&#34; sounds like &#34;doll&#34; and that Sackhoff takes off her top are certainly not related.Riddick's stealth and killing skills border on Batman-levels -- which he didn't have when facing down against the mud demons.  And of course, those mud demons show up in great numbers due to a natural phenomenon. Or to put it another way, &#34;Riddick&#34; is a lot like &#34;Pitch Black&#34; only with more nudity.That said, &#34;Riddick&#34; isn't a bad film, and is still arguably better than &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick.&#34;  But setting the bar low doesn't make it an improvement.  This is a bridge film to get us to a bigger budget in the next installment.

301901,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,6302219205,M. Oleson,"[1, 2]","Theatrical review. There may be spoilers.Eight years after escaped criminal Richard Riddick endured the latest of his ""Chronicled"" adventures, producer and star Vin Diesel along with director and co-writer David Twohy bring him back to life in this less ambitious film. In fact, the filmmakers make a mostly successful stab at the feel of the original movie in the franchise, ""Pitch Black"" (2000).Here Riddick (Diesel) is double crossed after years of playing royalty on some distant planet. By his own admission, he had gotten soft. He is unceremoniously dumped on a scorched planet devoid of humans but with plenty of local carnivores. With years of a life of luxury and debauchery he had lost his edge.  Riddick is quickly forced to get it back as his broken body must now deal with the large hyena-like creatures and the nasty water-serpents, both of which are looking for a meal.Riddick stumbles upon an abandon research facility and sends out a distress signal. Once he has been identified, a couple ships of mercs (mercenaries) set down after him. One for the reward (doubled if head brought back) and one out for revenge. A reference that goes back to ""Pitch Black."" The 2 assembled crews at first are competitors but eventually must work together, not only to kill or capture Riddick but to deal with the local fauna.The all-male crews, but for lesbian (or not) Dahl (Katee Sackhoff), are your standard ruffian himbos for the most part. The most diabolical is led by Santana (Jordi Molla). The other is led by the father (Matt Nable) of the Johns character from ""Pitch Black."" He wants answers as to what happen to his son. For most of the film, Riddick is in his full Rambo mode with elaborate traps, many of which are cool if not realistic. The sets here are pretty good, but I don't see any Oscars for technical designs.I did like the creature features, especially in the final act as Riddick pulls out all the stops to escape. Is this movie an improvement over ""The Chronicles of Riddick?"" Yes, the tension and sparseness of a good ""B"" movie are there. Does it equal the terror and horror of ""Pitch Black?"" Not quite. Will there be more Riddick adventures? That depends on how well this film does.

301936,AH88AEY9F6C9K,6302219205,Orlando G. Acosta,"[0, 0]","Well&#8230; Technically, if you count Dark Fury, it&#8217;s the 4th installment but I am only counting previous live actions; Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick.Riddick falls short on quite a bit but it does a pretty good job retreading Pitch Black. Having known that this was basically a Pitch Black redux I was impressed by how well the filmmakers deceive you, throwing up all sorts of figurative smoke and mirrors and sleight of hand to trick you into believing the story is original. It&#8217;s done very convincingly by interjecting bits and pieces from Chronicles in the beginning and at the end; serving as story arch bookends of sorts. I actually did not have an issue with this &#8216;illusion&#8217; as it was executed well. As a fan of the previous two films, I felt I was thrown a pretty good sized bone in terms of giving me a bit of story to compliment Chronicles. One could think that at some point early on, David Twohy wanted to release a Chronicles of Riddick Directors Cut version 2.0, pulling a Lucas and inserting a few new scenes, and at the same time he wanted to remake Pitch Black with a bigger budget and fancier effects. He pitched this (no pun intended), was given 40 mil and instructed to put both of his ideas together and make a new film.riddickOkay&#8230;So you want to know if this is a good thing or a bad thing? It depends on how hardcore of a fan you are would be my answer. Like I said earlier, I loved the first two films. I respected them for the lush underverse world they created. The creatures, the necromongers; the overal cannon&#8230;You don&#8217;t get this level of originality too often in modern science fiction these days. Where this one hurts the franchise is it doesn&#8217;t bring a whole lot new to the table. A disposable subplot of Johns looking for answers about his son&#8217;s ill fated encounter with the Furyan goes absolutely nowhere. It makes no impact on the story but doesn&#8217;t detract from it either.On a technical side. I was bothered by the fact I knew this film was shot entirely in a confined soundstage before I even watched the special features. At times the camera is tracking the action you can tell there is no depth in the background. This can pull you out of the moment if you fixate on it long enough like I did a couple of times. Also, I know we are not watching a film like this expecting Oscar-worthy performances but some performances are really bad. Bad to the point that I&#8217;m not sure if it was done intentionally to elevate Vin Diesel&#8217;s delivery of deadpan lines or just for the &#8216;camp&#8217; effect. The Visuals are at times awe inspiring and at times they look like matte paintings. It would seem that the FX team were novices in their craft and did not realize how many FX shots go into a science fiction flick that is filmed entirely in a green box and they cut corners&#8230;A lot of corners.The score is mostly carried over from Chronicles, which is a good thing. Sometimes it has it&#8217;s rough moments but all in all it won&#8217;t make or break the experience.Bottom line.. Riddick IS enjoyable&#8230;If you liked the first two and enjoy Sci Fi action flicks. If you don&#8217;t, or are on the fence, this one won&#8217;t charm you over. It may push you further away from getting your feet wet in the pool that is this great genre. While I don&#8217;t like using numerical scores on films, I will agree with IMDB&#8217;s review average of 6.4&#8230;Maybe even go as high as 7 but no more. I hope that if there is a 4th one somebody reads this review and heeds my simple, honest gripes. This is a great world that has been created.

Didn't like this one as much as I wanted to.  Vin Diesel was great.  Special effects team first rate.  Creature animation as good as the past movies,creative and fluid.  Plot has such huge unbelievable holes they could have been made with a Death Star.  Costly film time animating a robot that does nothing.  Interstellar space ships carry no spares for their most important parts.  If they did, this move would have ZERO plot.Most of all, the insistence by a particular verbal crowd the only acceptable sci-fi is R rated because normal people cannot have sci-fi.  All sci-fi moves have to have nudity, foul language, unbelievable plots and meaningless images which have NOTHING to do with the story so only these few people and perverted critics will accept it.

301954,A3VIHZUSNOGWFY,6302219205,Peter Olafson,"[0, 0]","... but things tumble downhill ass-over-teakettle once the mercenaries arrive. The movie never recovers.Why didn't director/writer Twohy stick more closely to the Riddick character? He was on the right track. The initial premise is a good one -- Riddick against the wilderness -- and Twohy over this stretch touches the right bases. Diesel, in his element, is at his most watchable. And the story still had promise as the first act drew to a close. The film had my full attention, and that is an increasingly rare thing these days.And yet, 10 minutes later, I was beginning to tune out.The shift to the mercs 40 minutes into the film adds nothing. In fact, without a steady supply of Diesel fuel, ""Riddick"" goes slack with astonishing speed and begins to drift inexorably and anonymously through terrain plowed with greater success in Twohy's earlier ""Pitch Black.""This dim second act raises all sorts of questions. Why squander your greatest asset this way? Why rely so heavily on last-second saves? (There are a bunch of them, and it's a sloppy device that quickly extinguishes the film's by-now-flickering flame of authenticity.) Why not bring the same attention to interior production design as to the environment?And, above all, why use these bland, all-purpose, SyFy channel mercs? They are simple cannon fodder and their scenes play like cannon fodder with insipid, ultra-predictable dialog. None of them have have any personality or purpose that isn't inconsequential or simply demeaning, and I felt more for Riddick's pet jackal than I did for any of these purported human beings. Give us a merc with history like Toombs -- played with immense gusto by Nick Chinland in ""Chronicles"" -- who, after being abandoned on Crematoria, would have had a whole new reason to want to see Riddick in a cage.Chinland is not here. Instead, we get Jordi Moll&agrave; as main villain. He over-acts. He over-acts a lot. That's not necessarily a bad solution to problematic second act. If you're not permitted to play a real character, a comic-book level villain rooted in over-the-topness can be kind of fun. (John Lithgow in ""Cliffhanger"" comes to mind.)But it's not fun, foaming-at-the-mouth over-acting. It's just bad old acting, without much motivation or conviction to back it up, and when his character finally joins the ranks of cannon fodder, I felt only indifference.In fact, beyond Diesel, there's almost nothing distinctive here -- Karl Urban, battered and dipped in flour, is barely present --  and the whole Necromonger worldview, which helped make Riddick so relentlessly watchable, is given short shrift.It's surprising to me that Twohy did not allow the grandeur of ""Chronicles"" to better inform this production. Perhaps he just didn't have the funding. The earlier film may not have been a license to print money, but beside the increasingly direct-to-DVD-like ""Riddick,"" it is a positive work of art. (There -is- an effort to link ""Riddick"" back to ""Pitch Black,"" but it is faint-hearted and quickly founders on a one-note character and loud but uninspired acting.The rest of the movie pretty much defies intelligent comment. Much of the last act is bog-standard material mired in wretched cliches. Twohy doesn't seem interesting in wrapping things up in a provocative way that lays a groundwork for what might follow. Or might have followed. So flimsy and improbable was this ending that I no longer much care if anything follows.",2,A solid first half-hour ...,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,3441,"['things', 'tumble', 'downhill', 'ass-over-teakettle', 'mercenaries', 'arrive', 'movie', 'never', 'recovers.Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'director/writer', 'Twohy', 'stick', 'more', 'closely', 'Riddick', 'character', 'was', 'right', 'track', 'initial', 'premise', 'good', 'one', 'Riddick', 'wilderness', 'Twohy', 'stretch', 'right', 'bases', 'Diesel', 'element', 'most', 'watchable', 'story', 'still', 'had', 'promise', 'first', 'act', 'drew', 'close', 'film', 'had', 'full', 'attention', 'increasingly', 'rare', 'thing', 'days.And', 'yet', '10', 'minutes', 'later', 'was', 'beginning', 'tune', 'out.The', 'shift', 'mercs', '40', 'minutes', 'film', 'nothing', 'fact', 'steady', 'supply', 'Diesel', 'fuel', 'Riddick', 'slack', 'astonishing', 'speed', 'drift', 'inexorably', 'anonymously', 'terrain', 'plowed', 'greater', 'success', 'Twohy', 'earlier', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'dim', 'second', 'act', 'sorts', 'questions', 'Why', 'squander', 'greatest', 'asset', 'way', 'Why', 'rely', 'so', 'heavily', 'last-second', 'saves', 'are', 'bunch', 'sloppy', 'device', 'quickly', 'film', 'by-now-flickering', 'flame', 'authenticity', 'Why', 'not', 'bring', 'same', 'attention', 'interior', 'production', 'design', 'environment', 'why', 'use', 'bland', 'all-purpose', 'SyFy', 'channel', 'mercs', 'are', 'simple', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'scenes', 'play', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'insipid', 'ultra-predictable', 'dialog', 'None', 'have', 'have', 'personality', 'purpose', ""n't"", 'inconsequential', 'simply', 'demeaning', 'felt', 'more', 'Riddick', 'pet', 'jackal', 'did', 'purported', 'human', 'beings', 'Give', 'merc', 'history', 'Toombs', 'played', 'immense', 'gusto', 'Nick', 'Chinland', 'Chronicles', 'who', 'being', 'abandoned', 'Crematoria', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'whole', 'new', 'reason', 'want', 'see', 'Riddick', 'cage.Chinland', 'not', 'here', 'Instead', 'get', 'Jordi', 'Moll', 'agrave', 'main', 'villain', 'lot', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'solution', 'problematic', 'second', 'act', ""'re"", 'not', 'permitted', 'play', 'real', 'character', 'comic-book', 'level', 'villain', 'rooted', 'over-the-topness', 'can', 'be', 'kind', 'fun', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Cliffhanger', 'mind', 'not', 'fun', 'foaming-at-the-mouth', 'over-acting', 'just', 'bad', 'old', 'acting', 'much', 'motivation', 'conviction', 'back', 'up', 'when', 'character', 'finally', 'ranks', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'felt', 'only', 'indifference.In', 'fact', 'Diesel', 'almost', 'nothing', 'distinctive', 'here', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'battered', 'dipped', 'flour', 'barely', 'present', 'whole', 'Necromonger', 'worldview', 'helped', 'make', 'Riddick', 'so', 'relentlessly', 'watchable', 'given', 'short', 'shrift.It', 'surprising', 'Twohy', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'grandeur', 'Chronicles', 'better', 'inform', 'production', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'funding', 'earlier', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'license', 'print', 'money', 'increasingly', 'direct-to-DVD-like', 'Riddick', 'positive', 'work', 'art', 'effort', 'link', 'Riddick', 'back', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'faint-hearted', 'quickly', 'founders', 'one-note', 'character', 'loud', 'uninspired', 'acting.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'defies', 'intelligent', 'comment', 'Much', 'last', 'act', 'bog-standard', 'material', 'mired', 'wretched', 'cliches', 'Twohy', ""n't"", 'seem', 'interesting', 'wrapping', 'things', 'up', 'provocative', 'way', 'groundwork', 'what', 'might', 'follow', 'might', 'have', 'followed', 'flimsy', 'improbable', 'was', 'ending', 'no', 'longer', 'much', 'care', 'anything']",N/A

We find him already stranded on an unknown planet, left for dead. He's severely injured and immediately has to battle for his life.Through a flashback, we find out what went wrong on the necromonger ship (if you want even more of the backstory you can read the online comic), but in true Furyan fashion, his powers of recuperation have him up and running in short order.But this new planet has treacherous lifeforms ready to kill at a moment's notice. The leopard dogs and water-dwelling creatures that have a very crafty attack prove to be all a severely injured Riddick can handle, but he adapts and eventually finds some sort of a bounty hunters' PlayStation where he alerts mercs that he is alive  and waiting.Two crews show up in short order. One is intent on bringing Riddick back dead, the other has a more clandestine agenda. There is a minor twist that plays out through the rest of the movie and by the end you're mot really sure which way it plays out.There are some pretty cool kills like a merc who's killed by a couple predator-restraints and Riddick displays a fair amount of bravado. But if you liked the other two movies, particularly Pitch Black, you'll like this one. There's a storm coming and when it finally arrives, the entire environment changes.I'd give this movie 3 out of five stars. There's something cutesy that happens early on, but they keep it to a minimum and it actually plays into the story. The ending leaves room for another installment which I'd definitely be in line for.Gerald RiceAuthor ofThe Zombie Show",4,Long Live Riddick!,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,1619,"['third', 'installment', 'Chronicles', 'Riddickstarts', 'bang', 'find', 'already', 'stranded', 'unknown', 'planet', 'left', 'dead', 'severely', 'injured', 'immediately', 'battle', 'life.Through', 'flashback', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'necromonger', 'ship', 'want', 'even', 'more', 'backstory', 'can', 'read', 'online', 'comic', 'true', 'Furyan', 'fashion', 'powers', 'recuperation', 'have', 'up', 'running', 'short', 'order.But', 'new', 'planet', 'treacherous', 'lifeforms', 'ready', 'kill', 'moment', 'notice', 'leopard', 'dogs', 'water-dwelling', 'creatures', 'have', 'very', 'crafty', 'attack', 'prove', 'be', 'severely', 'injured', 'Riddick', 'can', 'handle', 'eventually', 'sort', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'PlayStation', 'where', 'mercs', 'alive', 'waiting.Two', 'crews', 'show', 'up', 'short', 'order', 'One', 'intent', 'bringing', 'Riddick', 'back', 'dead', 'other', 'more', 'clandestine', 'agenda', 'minor', 'twist', 'out', 'rest', 'movie', 'end', ""'re"", 'mot', 'really', 'sure', 'way', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'kills', 'merc', 'who', 'killed', 'couple', 'predator-restraints', 'Riddick', 'fair', 'amount', 'bravado', 'liked', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'particularly', 'Pitch', 'Black', ""'ll"", 'like', 'one', 'storm', 'coming', 'when', 'finally', 'entire', 'environment', 'changes.I', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', '3', 'five', 'stars', 'something', 'cutesy', 'early', 'keep', 'minimum', 'actually', 'story', 'ending', 'leaves', 'room', 'installment', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'be', 'line', 'for.Gerald', 'RiceAuthor', 'Zombie', 'Show']",N/A

But 2013's Riddick film redeems the character, the franchise, and it has me right back where I was 13 years ago after watching Pitch Black for the dozenth time: hoping for a sequel!In this flick, Riddick is abandoned on a desolate planet and back fighting some sick looking monsters to survive....The most vicious being the scorpion-like Mud Demons. So when Riddick realizes that major approaching rain storms will turn the planet to mud...well let's just says that you don't want to be on a muddy planet that's infested with Mud Demons. So Riddick's only hope is to make his presence on the planet known to intergalactic bounty hunters by setting off an emergency beacon. When the bounty hunters arrive looking to kill versus capture Riddick, he's got his work cut out to figure out a way off the planet alive.The movie gets an R, but (once again) I think the MPAA got it wrong and should have given it a PG-13.

302032,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,6302219205,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[13, 17]","Riddick is one of the coolest anti-heroes to come out in very, very long time. The man is an efficient killing machine, but has more depth to him than merely his talents. Riddick is a back to basics kind of movie, and gives us the character with the best of the previous renditions (which include movies, video games and a direct to video animated feature). This R rated flick is more than just the violence Riddick fans crave. It touches on different aspects of the character and gives us a better look at his view on life, the universe and such.So Pitch Black was the fan favorite. Riddick was just a bad guy who was going some good, but only because it benefited him. Then in the end we see there is more to him than just a selfish killer. Dark Fury (the animated feature) was basically lip service for the fans who craved seeing Riddick as a complete bad ass. Chronicles of Riddick (a disapointment for many... not me) put the character in a grandiose setting and while he kept talking like he was just looking out for number one there were plenty of other people he was standing up for. From these two movies we see Riddick evolve to being more than just tough guy. The fans didn't like the direction, so director David Twohy and star Vin Diesel decided to go back to the roots. However they didn't just redo Pitch Black. Far from it. This is probably the most personal Riddick movie to date.The movie starts with Riddick getting unceremoniously tossed from the Necromongers of the previous film. From there he is stuck in an alien world having to fend for himself. The first act of the film is just Riddick. You get to see how his mind works as he finds ways to survive no mans land. You also get to hear some reflection on who Riddick is and the thinking behind why he is the anti-hero that he is. It's a really nice change of pace from the previous movie, which was practically non-stop with the bravado.The second act is even more interesting. Riddick finds an abandoned outpost and hatches a plan to get off the planet, which includes signaling mercs to come get him. Riddick knows there isn't much time until this planet's monsters start coming out of the woodwork and kill everything in their path (here's the Pitch Black reference). Riddick spies on the mercs and learns more about which ones are particularly brutal and which are professional. From here it appears he picks his targets, killing off the bad mercs one by one. It's a reminder that Riddick doesn't just kill for the hell of it. He has his own moral code (the Chronicles of Riddick reference). We even get the over the top &#34;he's too bad for words&#34; example when he calls out exactly how he will kill one of the mercs... while he is captured and bound (sounds like a Dark Fury reference). If you look for it the second act is an almost complete profile of Riddick.Then the third act comes along. Tons of monsters everywhere and everybody is in a panic on how to get out. Riddick's plan is starting to come to fruition, but not without it's hiccups. This is where the full on action from Pitch Black comes into play. It feels similar of course, but at the same time it's a very different animal. Riddick has two enemies to deal with, the mercs and the monsters. There is a pretty intricate play on alliances and betrayal that moves the act to more emotionally charged (and satisfying) heights. You also get to see a back story (again a reference to Pitch Black) come full circle. All in all the story is rock solid and hits all the marks that the previous franchise items got right.The production values of this movie are remarkable. This was a low budget movie when compared to other A list sci-fi/fantasy films being made these days. It looks a lot more expensive. Sure there only a few sets, but the story was perfect for it. Sure the computer animation can be noticeable at times, but I have seen a lot worse with movies several times the budget. The pacing was right with just enough reflection at the beginning and the right amount of thrills in the end to give this film a very polished look. At $38 million dollars Twohy and Diesel were able to make a movie filled with depth, story, action and thrills. Considering all the movies done that year that were $130-$200+ million in production costs, but fell flat this is a great achievement. Add to that the fact the movie made almost $100 million worldwide (more than twice the return on investment) and I would call Riddick is standout success of the year.This Blu-Ray has scrawled on the top of it Unrated Director's Cut. Usually you see this in video releases as just a way to entice you to buy it hoping to see something shocking, titillating or just plain interesting that wasn't included, or maybe taken out to keep the rating, in the theatrical release. Often times the unrated moniker is worthless with nothing added even worth noting that. With Riddick you do get something special. It's only an additional eight minutes added to the film, but there are two big additions that make it worthwhile. The first is more time on Riddick's role as the Necromonger ruler at the beginning of the film. It's essentially a live action version of the animated short Blindsided. Though the theatrical release did a good job transitioning you from the previous film this additional time really fleshes it out more. Plus you get a lot more Karl Urban as Vaako. The other notable addition is an extended ending that eludes to a sequel. Maybe it was taking so as to not keep our hopes up. However I welcome the lead in.Like the Chronicles of Riddick blu-ray you get both the Theatrical version and the Director's Cut in this disk. Visually the disk really stands out with a 1080p/AVC transfer. Reports say the color and contrast are near perfect. Audio will be strong with with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track. The special features are a bit lean on length, but are good on content. I am a bit disappointed there isn't an audio commentary. I would think Twohy and Diesel would have loved doing one and giving the fans even more dirt on the Riddick movie and franchise. Here is a list of the other features:The Twohy Touch - A six minute featurette on director David Twohy's contributions to the Riddick franchise. There are cast and crew commentaries covering their experience with Twohy as well.Riddickian Tech - Going a bit over ten minutes this feature covers the various vehicles and weapons on the film and how they were designed and implemented on the film.The World of Riddick - An exploration on the design and inspiration for the movie's setting, &#34;Not Furya&#34;. 11 minute run time.Vin's Riddick - Similar to The Twohy Touch this featurette cover's Vin Diesel's contributions to the franchise and also includes interviews with cast and crew talking about Vin. Running time about eight minutes.Met the Mercs - An interesting compilation of interviews with the supporting cast and their comments on the characters they portray. It goes into some detail with discussion about the weapons used and clothes they wear. 11 minute run time.Riddick: Blindsided - This is the animated short that was released prior to the movie to help promote the film. It chronicles Riddicks role as the Lord Marshall of the Necromongers just before his betrayal. The animation is more like an animated comic book than full on animation.Riddick brings the best of all the previous films together into one cohesive and satisfying film. I dearly hope with the success of this movie that we will get to see Diesel and Twohy's ambitions for this character come to life with future productions.",5,Finally an unrated version worthy of

One is Dominic Toretto.  The other is Riddick.  Unlike his character in the Pacifier, he was meant to play these two characters.  No matter what the critics say, I will go see Vin Diesel in any film he portrays these characters.On Riddick's opening night, I went to see the film.  I was disappointed. Riddick is almost the same exact film as Pitch Black.Aside from a few minor differences, this film contains many of the same elements.  Allow me to list them (Beware.  Spoilers ahead.):1.  The film takes place on a desolate planet that does not have much life.2.  There are bounty hunters that want to capture him.3.  There are monsters on the planet that want to eat all of them.4.  The main plot is to get off the planet.5.  Two hot women.  One will die.6.  Scene of Riddick battling the monsters with his bare hands.7.  Scene where Riddick cuts the monster in the stomach and its guts come out.8.  Sexual frustration between the lead woman and Riddick.9.  Monsters will come out of their respective habitats once the conditions are in  their favor.10. Bounty hunters must work with Riddick in order to survive.11. Takes the team through the monsters in order to reach their goal.I thought I was going to see a film with Riddick as the Lord King Marshall of the Necromongers.  I guess with a budget of $40 million, the makers of the film could not afford to create that storyline.

302056,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,6302219205,The Cool Guy,"[0, 0]","What does that even mean?I was disappointed with this movie. I felt like it was a huge step back for the franchise. Where ""Chronicles of Riddick"" elevated what had begun in ""Pitch Black"" to epic levels, ""Riddick"" drops it all back to just being a standard action flick. It did little or nothing to advance the characters, and was not a satisfying continuation of ""Chronicles"".The story I found hard to buy into. So the emperor of the known universe is headed to Furya (later to be stranded on a planet), and he doesn't even have one advisor or security guard to accompany him? I mean, I know Riddick is awesome but I didn't think he was dumb. An emperor would have an entire entourage.And then when he activates the beacon, suddenly all these death warrants display, and mercs show up to kill him. Uh, excuse me? This is the emperor of the Necromongers here! On politics of this scale, there would be loyalist factions searching for him and trying to rescue him immediately. Especially with the Necromongers, he'd have all kind of religious freaks laying down their lives for him. There would also be opportunists trying to rescue him just in the hopes of a reward. But kill him and ONLY kill him? No, I'm not buying it. Not unless you want to forget that the entire ""Chronicles of Riddick"" movie happened, which apparently this movie does.Another annoyance to me was the role of Dahl played by Katee Sackoff. First, was it really necessary to show her topless? Not that I didn't mind looking, but it had nothing to do with anything. It was just a distraction, and a tasteless one at that. Oh wait, it was so Riddick could steal her makeup mirror... Seriously?Speaking of tasteless... The way Riddick talks to Dahl I found to be pretty disgusting. I know Riddick is cool and Riddick's the man, but the way it came off here I just didn't like. And was it not a little bit insulting that he is so charming that he turns a lesbian straight? I've heard it said in reviews that Dahl isn't supposed to be a lesbian, but is just pretending to be one so the other mercs don't hit on her. But this movie gives no indication of that. Taken as it comes, Riddick turns a gay woman straight. Ugh. Really?Or say she's secretly straight after all. But is that scenario any better? She pretends to be a lesbian, until she can no longer resist his charms. And what was it about Riddick that she found so charming, exactly? When he spied on her in the shower? Or when he talked dirty and told her he's going to rape her (sort of - she'll ask for it first)? Anyone else who did that would be labeled a perv. I didn't like this at all. I felt like Katee deserved better.That's not to say the whole movie was bad. Being a Riddick fan, I still enjoyed it a lot. It may not seem that way from my review, but I did like the movie. I just felt like it could have been much, much more. After so many years in development, it was a huge missed opportunity.I liked the role of Daddy Johns. I felt like that characterization was really well done, and a nice callback to ""Pitch Black"".I also - for the first time in my life - actually liked the CGI in a movie. For the first time that I can ever remember, the CGI looks so realistic you can forget it's CGI. I'm talking about the jackal. It was so well done - and such a good character - that it was really enjoyable to watch. I mean, you know this is a made up, CGI creature. But it looked so realistic it was uncanny. I kept feeling like I was looking at a real dog on the screen. And it interacted seamlessly with Riddick. That part of the movie was just really well done.I also liked seeing Karl Urban, if only for a cameo. Karl is a fantastic actor. After seeing him in ""Dredd"", it's hard for me to watch him take a second seat to Vin Diesel. I sure hope there's a 4th movie, one that revolves more around Karl's character, Vaako.The differences between the Theatrical version and Director's Cut here are slight. The biggest difference is the ending. The Director's Cut takes the same ending as the Theatrical version, but then adds an epilogue of sorts. The epilogue has Riddick returning to his kingdom, and hints at what happened to Vaako. It almost comes off as a spoiler for a 4th movie.Anyway, in short, I liked this movie okay but thought it was a missed opportunity. It certainly wasn't up to snuff with the previous films. If you're a Riddick fan, then you'll enjoy it. If not, why are you reading this?Thanks for your time.",2,"""Tell Dahl to keep it warm for me.""",1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,4458,"['What', 'even', 'mean', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'huge', 'step', 'back', 'franchise', 'Where', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', 'elevated', 'what', 'had', 'begun', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'epic', 'levels', 'Riddick', 'back', 'just', 'being', 'standard', 'action', 'flick', 'did', 'little', 'nothing', 'advance', 'characters', 'was', 'not', 'satisfying', 'continuation', 'Chronicles', '.The', 'story', 'found', 'hard', 'buy', 'emperor', 'known', 'universe', 'headed', 'Furya', 'later', 'be', 'stranded', 'planet', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'one', 'advisor', 'security', 'guard', 'accompany', 'mean', 'know', 'Riddick', 'awesome', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'dumb', 'emperor', 'would', 'have', 'entire', 'entourage.And', 'then', 'when', 'beacon', 'suddenly', 'death', 'warrants', 'display', 'mercs', 'show', 'up', 'kill', 'Uh', 'emperor', 'Necromongers', 'here', 'politics', 'scale', 'would', 'be', 'loyalist', 'factions', 'searching', 'trying', 'rescue', 'immediately', 'Especially', 'Necromongers', ""'d"", 'have', 'kind', 'religious', 'freaks', 'laying', 'down', 'lives', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'opportunists', 'trying', 'rescue', 'just', 'hopes', 'reward', 'kill', 'ONLY', 'kill', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'buying', 'Not', 'want', 'forget', 'entire', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', 'movie', 'happened', 'apparently', 'movie', 'annoyance', 'was', 'role', 'Dahl', 'played', 'Katee', 'Sackoff', 'First', 'was', 'really', 'necessary', 'show', 'topless', 'Not', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'looking', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'was', 'just', 'distraction', 'tasteless', 'one', 'Oh', 'wait', 'was', 'so', 'Riddick', 'could', 'steal', 'makeup', 'mirror', 'Seriously', 'Speaking', 'tasteless', 'way', 'Riddick', 'talks', 'Dahl', 'found', 'be', 'pretty', 'disgusting', 'know', 'Riddick', 'cool', 'Riddick', 'man', 'way', 'came', 'here', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'not', 'little', 'bit', 'insulting', 'so', 'charming', 'lesbian', 'straight', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'said', 'reviews', 'Dahl', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'lesbian', 'just', 'pretending', 'be', 'one', 'other', 'mercs', 'do', ""n't"", 'hit', 'movie', 'indication', 'Taken', 'Riddick', 'gay', 'woman', 'straight', 'Ugh', 'Really', 'say', 'secretly', 'straight', 'scenario', 'better', 'be', 'lesbian', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'resist', 'charms', 'what', 'was', 'Riddick', 'found', 'so', 'charming', 'exactly', 'When', 'spied', 'shower', 'when', 'talked', 'dirty', 'told', 'going', 'rape', 'sort', ""'ll"", 'ask', 'first', 'Anyone', 'else', 'who', 'did', 'would', 'be', 'labeled', 'perv', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'felt', 'Katee', 'deserved', 'not', 'say', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'Being', 'Riddick', 'fan', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'way', 'review', 'did', 'movie', 'just', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'development', 'was', 'huge', 'missed', 'opportunity.I', 'liked', 'role', 'Daddy', 'Johns', 'felt', 'characterization', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'nice', 'callback', 'Pitch', 'Black', '.I', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'actually', 'liked', 'CGI', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'ever', 'remember', 'CGI', 'so', 'realistic', 'can', 'forget', 'CGI', ""'m"", 'talking', 'jackal', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'such', 'good', 'character', 'was', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'mean', 'know', 'made', 'up', 'CGI', 'creature', 'looked', 'so', 'realistic', 'was', 'uncanny', 'kept', 'feeling', 'was', 'looking', 'real', 'dog', 'screen', 'interacted', 'seamlessly', 'Riddick', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'well', 'done.I', 'also', 'liked', 'seeing', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'only', 'cameo', 'Karl', 'fantastic', 'actor', 'seeing', 'Dredd', 'hard', 'watch', 'take', 'second', 'seat', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'sure', 'hope', '4th', 'movie', 'one', 'more', 'Karl', 'character', 'Vaako.The', 'differences', 'Theatrical', 'version', 'Director', 'Cut', 'here', 'are', 'slight', 'biggest', 'difference', 'ending', 'Director', 'Cut', 'same', 'ending', 'Theatrical', 'version', 'then', 'epilogue', 'sorts', 'epilogue', 'Riddick', 'returning', 'kingdom', 'hints', 'what', 'happened', 'Vaako', 'almost', 'off', 'spoiler', '4th', 'movie.Anyway', 'short', 'liked', 'movie', 'okay', 'thought', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'snuff', 'previous', 'films', ""'re"", 'Riddick', 'fan', 'then', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'not', 'why', 'are', 'reading', 'Thanks', 'time']",N/A

302062,A277UC8WJVAIIE,6302219205,The Wiz,"[74, 89]","This latest sequel in the Riddick series, takes us full circle as the baddest anti-hero in the galaxy finds himself betrayed by the Necromongers and left for dead.  The first part of this film is essentially a great survival story, where Riddick returns to his more feral roots however the tenor quickly changes when he finds a way to signal for ""rescue"" but instead gets reminded that he's still a wanted fugitive (VERY wanted).  At this point, the movie becomes semi-horror reminiscent of the original ""Pitch Black"" (except much better) as he reminds everyone, including the audience, just why he's so feared.This is easily the best of the trilogy in my opinion and presents a darker and more violent story than ""Chronicles"" represented by the PG-13 back to R rating however it doesn't saturate the dialogue with gratuitous profanity as in the first film; there's also very brief nudity and again, lots of violence but these things all supplement what is essentially a fierce tale of survival and a very well made sci-fi film.As I was watching Riddick at one point, surrounded by enemies in the midst of a raging storm, I was reminded of a line from a poem: ""Out of the night that covers me, black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul.

302069,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,6302219205,Tim Janson,"[1, 2]","When Pitch Black came out in 2000 it became a surprise hit and made a star out of Vin Diesel who portrayed the anti-hero, Riddick.  But the 2004 sequel The Chronicles of Riddick disappointed fans with its deviation from what made the first film work to a more space opera tone.  With Riddick (and boy these guys are not too creative with their titles are they?) the series returns to its Sci-fi Horror roots and while it might be too evocative of Pitch Black, it&#8217;s still a fun and effective film.The film begins five years after the events in Chronicles as Riddick has become bored with his life as Lord Marshall of the Necromonger fleet.  An assassination attempt prompts Riddick to give up the post to Vaako (Urban) in exchange for being taken to his home planet of Furya.  Vaako&#8217;s aide, Krone, and a handful of other soldiers accompany Riddick down to the planet.  Riddick quickly realizes that this world is not Furya and that he has been betrayed.  He barely escapes, killing several soldiers although Krone manages to get away.Riddick finds himself without weapons on a planet filled with hostile, native life including packs of Jackal-like predators and poisonous creatures that look like crosses between pincer bugs and scorpions called &#8220;mud demons&#8221;.  He makes his way to an abandoned outpost and sets off an emergency beacon which brings two rival teams of bounty hunters to the planets intent on collecting the reward for the infamous criminal.  Riddick begins a cat and mouse with the two groups, eventually managing to steal the power cores of their ships and using them to negotiate his safe passage off the planet.  But before anyone can leave the region is struck by a massive storm which causes hundreds of the mud demons to come up from underground and besiege Riddick and the bounty hunters.Riddick flies so closely to Pitch Black that it almost seems like a remake.  Riddick has to ally with those who want to imprison him and having to fight off swarms of deadly creatures which come out during the storm&#8230;which coincidentally is also in the dark.  But for all its lack of originality Riddick still works because of the central character.  Riddick is so unbelievably bad-ass that even the bounty hunters end up deferring to him as their best chance to survive.  Vi Diesel&#8217;s tombstone-grating voice adds the whipped cream on top of what continues to be a fascinating character.  While Director David Twohy doesn&#8217;t hit the same heights of terror and suspense that he did in Pitch Black, he does have a more interesting cast to play with this time around.At one point Riddick is scaling a hill, surrounded by the mud demons and fighting them off with anything he can find.  It evoked the image from Frank Frazetta&#8217;s painting of Conan poised atop a mound of bodies and fighting off scores of enemies.  Riddick is one of those movies that takes full advantage of its 5.1 DTS-HD sound and was made to be played with a sound bar or theater system as it virtually surrounds you with its resonating depth.The Blu-ray comes with both the Unrated Director&#8217;s Cut and original theatrical cut.  The Director&#8217;s Cut runs about eight minutes longer and includes an extended opening sequence and an alternate ending.  The cast features Katee Sackoff and WWE wrestler Dave Bastita, both playing mercenaries on opposite sides.Blu-ray ExtrasThe Twohy Touch (6:22) - The writer/director discusses returning to the series after nine yearsRiddickian Tech (10:14) - This featurette covers the props, weapons, and ships used in the film.Vin's Riddick (8:50) &#8211; Diesel as well as the other cast members talk about the character of RiddickMeet the Mercs (10:44) &#8211; this featurette covers the cast of the two groups of bounty hunters/Mercs and their various characters and training.The World of Riddick (10:50) &#8211; This looks at the visual effects of the film including creating the world and the various alien creatures.Riddick Blindsided (5:20) &#8211; This is a motion comic which was adapted into live-action scenes featured in the Director's Cut.",3,Getting back to the Pitch Black roots,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,4115,"['When', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'came', 'out', '2000', 'became', 'surprise', 'hit', 'made', 'star', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'who', 'portrayed', 'anti-hero', 'Riddick', '2004', 'sequel', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', 'disappointed', 'fans', 'deviation', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'work', 'more', 'space', 'opera', 'tone', 'Riddick', 'boy', 'guys', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'creative', 'titles', 'are', 'series', 'Sci-fi', 'Horror', 'roots', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'evocative', 'Pitch', 'Black', '8217', 's', 'still', 'fun', 'effective', 'film.The', 'film', 'five', 'years', 'events', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', 'become', 'bored', 'life', 'Lord', 'Marshall', 'Necromonger', 'fleet', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'prompts', 'Riddick', 'give', 'up', 'post', 'Vaako', 'Urban', 'exchange', 'being', 'taken', 'home', 'planet', 'Furya', 'Vaako', '8217', 's', 'aide', 'Krone', 'handful', 'other', 'soldiers', 'accompany', 'Riddick', 'down', 'planet', 'Riddick', 'quickly', 'world', 'not', 'Furya', 'been', 'betrayed', 'barely', 'killing', 'several', 'soldiers', 'Krone', 'get', 'away.Riddick', 'finds', 'weapons', 'planet', 'filled', 'hostile', 'native', 'life', 'including', 'packs', 'Jackal-like', 'predators', 'poisonous', 'creatures', 'look', 'crosses', 'pincer', 'bugs', 'scorpions', 'called', '8220', 'demons', '8221', 'way', 'abandoned', 'outpost', 'sets', 'off', 'emergency', 'beacon', 'two', 'rival', 'teams', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'planets', 'intent', 'collecting', 'reward', 'infamous', 'criminal', 'Riddick', 'cat', 'mouse', 'two', 'groups', 'eventually', 'managing', 'steal', 'power', 'cores', 'ships', 'using', 'negotiate', 'safe', 'passage', 'planet', 'anyone', 'can', 'leave', 'region', 'struck', 'massive', 'storm', 'hundreds', 'mud', 'demons', 'come', 'up', 'underground', 'besiege', 'Riddick', 'bounty', 'hunters.Riddick', 'flies', 'so', 'closely', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'almost', 'remake', 'Riddick', 'ally', 'who', 'want', 'imprison', 'having', 'fight', 'off', 'swarms', 'deadly', 'creatures', 'come', 'out', 'storm', '8230', 'coincidentally', 'also', 'dark', 'lack', 'originality', 'Riddick', 'still', 'central', 'character', 'Riddick', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'bad-ass', 'even', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'end', 'up', 'deferring', 'best', 'chance', 'survive', 'Vi', 'Diesel', '8217', 'tombstone-grating', 'voice', 'whipped', 'cream', 'top', 'what', 'be', 'fascinating', 'character', 'Director', 'David', 'Twohy', 'doesn', '8217', 'hit', 'same', 'heights', 'terror', 'suspense', 'did', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'have', 'more', 'interesting', 'cast', 'play', 'time', 'one', 'point', 'Riddick', 'scaling', 'hill', 'surrounded', 'mud', 'demons', 'fighting', 'off', 'anything', 'can', 'find', 'evoked', 'image', 'Frank', 'Frazetta', '8217', 's', 'painting', 'Conan', 'poised', 'atop', 'mound', 'bodies', 'fighting', 'off', 'scores', 'enemies', 'Riddick', 'one', 'movies', 'full', 'advantage', '5.1', 'DTS-HD', 'sound', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'played', 'sound', 'bar', 'theater', 'system', 'virtually', 'resonating', 'depth.The', 'Blu-ray', 'Unrated', 'Director', '8217', 'Cut', 'original', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'Director', '8217', 's', 'Cut', 'eight', 'minutes', 'longer', 'extended', 'opening', 'sequence', 'alternate', 'ending', 'cast', 'Katee', 'Sackoff', 'WWE', 'wrestler', 'Dave', 'Bastita', 'playing', 'mercenaries', 'opposite', 'sides.Blu-ray', 'ExtrasThe', 'Twohy', 'Touch', '6:22', 'writer/director', 'returning', 'series', 'nine', 'yearsRiddickian', 'Tech', '10:14', 'featurette', 'props', 'weapons', 'ships', 'used', 'film.Vin', 'Riddick', '8:50', '8211', 'Diesel', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'talk', 'character', 'RiddickMeet', 'Mercs', '10:44', '8211', 'featurette', 'cast', 'two', 'groups', 'bounty', 'hunters/Mercs', 'various', 'characters', 'training.The', 'World', 'Riddick', '10:50', '8211', 'visual', 'effects', 'film', 'including', 'creating', 'world', 'various', 'alien', 'creatures.Riddick', 'Blindsided', '5:20', '8211', 'motion', 'comic', 'was', 'adapted', 'live-action', 'scenes', 'featured', 'Director', 'Cut']",N/A

This is shaping up to be one of those.&#34; After being betrayed by the Necromongers, Riddick (Diesel) is left for dead. Alone on a remote desolate planet he is forced to regain his instincts and survive the harsh landscape. When he notices a deadly storm approaching he has no choice but to activate a beacon that draws bounty hunters to him. Now he has to find a way to escape while battling bounty hunters, an alien species and a oncoming deadly storm. First thing I should say is that I'm not a huge fan of this series. I thought Pitch Black was OK but didn't like Chronicles of Riddick. So my expectations for this were pretty low going in. Even with low expectations I wasn't impressed by this movie. The beginning was very slow movie and Vin Diesel doesn't have the chops to carry a movie where he is the only one it it for longer then 5 minutes so the first 20 was a struggle. Then it turned to the bounty hunters and Vin Diesel pretty much disappeared for awhile. When he returned the movie fell into a straight remake of Pitch Black. A group of mercenaries who want nothing more then to kill Riddick for a reward but realize they need his help with the aliens and storm.

It is inconcievable that any other actor out there could ever succesfully succeed Vin as Riddick. The set-up of the movie is clearly identifiable as a Riddick-movie and the action-sequences are great. A real popcorn-movie just as it should be.One thing however lets down the side.

Diet Riddick?First of all, most of the film is Riddick limping around trying to befriend alien dogs and immunize himself from the sting of an amphibian.  He has flashbacks to being the leader of the half-dead people he defeated in movie 2.  Big deal.  Nothing happens.  Nothing meaningful comes of these memories.  We get to see Karl Urban for five seconds.  Big deal.  Literally for NO REASON.  Go back to Almost Human.  Then, FINALLY, Riddick causes a bunch of mercs to come get him.Well, folks, the mercs don't really improve anything.  The mercs are dumb.  They set up tech that is . . . dumb.  The dialogue is . . . dumb.  Dave Bautista's character, the guy who you might think is going to give Riddick a pretty terrible one on one struggle, is pretty useless.  I'm trying so hard not to flat out tell you why.  The girl is pretty tough, which is fun.  But the mercs are all forgettable.At least there is some action.  One merc has a really lame &#34;surprise&#34; connection to a character in the first movie.  The monsters get rowdy.  That's all.  Riddick is a beast, as always.  Diesel nails his character.The ending is the absolute WORST ending I have seen in a movie in a long time.  It is as if an artsy fartsy writer/director just threw a scene together cobbled from the ludicrous philosophical ideas floating in his brain after he just dropped acid.  Transcendence.  Oh, thank you Karl Urban's two minute cameo for that incredible foreshadowing.  Huh?They have taken a great anti-hero and given him over to half-witted writing and meaningless plot devices.I am so baffled that I have to re-watch this film.
