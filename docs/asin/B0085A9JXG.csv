1546657,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B0085A9JXG,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","Like, when I first saw that this was on like the Hallmark Channel, I like thought, ""OMG!  Will and Kate!  Like the Totally Cutest Couple Ever!""  So I just like had to watch.And so I like made some popcorn, then like sat on the couch, and then like watched my most favoritist lovebirds of like all time!  Yeah.But like the best part of the movie was when they like ""meet cute.""  How William bumped into Kate, and how Kate dropped her laundry, and how The Prince then like helped her pick up her laundry!  But he's like such a Royal Gentleman that he didn't pick up her, well, underwear!  Like what a nice guy!  And like so dreamy!So, OK; you get it already, and I'm surprised if you're still, like, reading.  This film's demographic was probably 12 to 17 year old girls.  But while I hate films that play with your emotions -- this one surely does that -- and I hate films where they play cheesy music to continue to play with your emotions -- does it again -- and I really, really, really hate films where some reviewer even considers using the phrase ""meets cute"" (Yikes!  Isn't that the most annoying expression ever?  Maybe even worse than the surely-overused ""like"") -- seen above -- well, I kind of enjoyed watching this pair for some odd reason.  You surely won't have to exercise the old noggin' with this film, so you can easily multitask; how about reading a book and watching?  You should easily be able to do both.But would the Royals like it?  Well, it surely doesn't air out too much dirty Royal laundry, other than during that scene in the first Act, discussed above.  So they probably think that it's kind of cute, and it won't hurt them therefore in the old PR department.  And I think that you just might like like it too.  Well, at least think that it's ""OK.""",3,"Like, OMG!",1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,1777,"['when', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'like', 'thought', 'OMG', 'Will', 'Kate', 'Totally', 'Cutest', 'Couple', 'Ever', 'just', 'had', 'watch.And', 'so', 'like', 'made', 'popcorn', 'then', 'sat', 'couch', 'then', 'watched', 'most', 'favoritist', 'lovebirds', 'time', 'Yeah.But', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'like', 'meet', 'cute', 'How', 'William', 'bumped', 'Kate', 'how', 'Kate', 'dropped', 'laundry', 'how', 'Prince', 'then', 'helped', 'pick', 'up', 'laundry', 'Royal', 'Gentleman', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'well', 'underwear', 'what', 'nice', 'guy', 'so', 'dreamy', 'So', 'OK', 'get', 'already', ""'m"", 'surprised', ""'re"", 'still', 'reading', 'film', 'demographic', 'was', 'probably', '12', '17', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'hate', 'films', 'play', 'emotions', 'one', 'surely', 'hate', 'films', 'where', 'play', 'cheesy', 'music', 'continue', 'play', 'emotions', 'again', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'hate', 'films', 'where', 'reviewer', 'even', 'considers', 'using', 'phrase', 'meets', 'cute', 'Yikes', ""n't"", 'most', 'annoying', 'expression', 'ever', 'Maybe', 'even', 'worse', 'surely-overused', 'seen', 'well', 'kind', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'pair', 'odd', 'reason', 'surely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'exercise', 'old', 'noggin', 'film', 'can', 'easily', 'multitask', 'how', 'reading', 'book', 'watching', 'should', 'easily', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'both.But', 'would', 'Royals', 'Well', 'surely', ""n't"", 'air', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'dirty', 'Royal', 'laundry', 'other', 'scene', 'first', 'Act', 'discussed', 'probably', 'think', 'kind', 'cute', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'therefore', 'old', 'PR', 'department', 'think', 'just', 'might', 'like', 'too', 'Well', 'least', 'think', 'OK']",William & Catherine: A Royal Romance

I was hoping for something interestingly new or refreshing with this romance but it feel very short.  There was no chemistry between the main actors and the story was very flat.
