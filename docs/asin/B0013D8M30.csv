The title of this is very misleading. There is nothing to very little belly dance about it. Yes, the back cover says it is a fusion of bollywood style dancing & bellydance, but in truth it is all bollywood with maybe a few undulations thrown in. It's a very boring routine to boot. I wouldn't even rate it at a beginner level for intensity. It's not very challenging & is not likely to get your heartrate up. The back cover specifically says this is a fun workout. I kept wondering when the fun would begin. Ugh. I gave this 2 stars, 1 star for each good thing to mention. The music is good. Very original compared to many other fitness DVDs on the market. The instructor is really good. I like her personality & she cues very well. It's unfortunate that she appeared in such a bad workout. If you like bollywood dancing & don't want to do much of a workout this is for you.

Yes, I am not the most co-ordinated person in the world, but instructor / Dancer Kili Marti, gives a very helpful tutorial on how to do each step that we would be doing, so I had a, ""heads-up"" on what was coming.  Kili was exuberant and playful, and yet she put me through a great workout where I was pretty sweaty when done.  She's really good at queuing, and she breaks this dvd down into 3 dances after the initial warm up: Belly moves groove, Cleopatra Cardio Combo ( which I have to say is my absolute favorite ) and Hip Roll Hindi Combo, then of course there is the cool down.  Doing this dvd made me feel more feminine and kinda sexy, cause I was swaying my hips and moving my arms sinuously and just forgetting that I was actually doing a workout dvd.  I think this is a great intro to belly dancing ( though if you're looking for an authentic form / study of belly dancing, this probably isn't what you're looking for, as this is more an aerobic / cardio workout. ) and has made me want to explore more of this fun, sensual way of dancing / working out.
