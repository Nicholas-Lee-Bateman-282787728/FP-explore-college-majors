1697294,A3CPJYAQMCUGNR,B00KHA88PC,Chris Matthews,"[19, 703]","A few months ago, I had to completely overhaul my business Blowman's Bus Indeed  after coming under investigation with the department of health. It seemed the best way to further avoid unnecessary investigations and paperwork was to simply change my business plan. Too many parents had a problem with the mobile petting zoo and ice cream shop I ran from my renovated seatless school bus.With no formal refrigeration per say other than some coolers I picked up on clearance at Lowes. Remotely, I might see why some parents might complain. Most 'normal' kids do not eat their ice cream in a freezer, but they still had issue with that.As for the mobile petting zoo, I think they were out of line. After paying a small fare, individuals and tour groups would load up onto the bus as I drive it around the town. Many of the older or sickly animals were donated from shelters while others I would find as I drove about. For the most part, the animals were well-mannered. Keeping them in cages on a moving bus seemed rather pointless and simply cruel. Their areas were clearly marked with colored signs.You're welcome PETA.If and when any of the animals started to get slightly agitated with all the kids, I would break out the first aid kit. Then, I simply look for a place to pull the bus over and let the animal out. Preferably, a well-populated area like in front of a school, grocery store or freeway for someone else to find and care for it.Now, my bus still smelling like an animal kennel, has been converted into a mobile movie theater. I blacked out the windows with soap and spray paint, duct taped a few chairs, tables, couches and bean/dude bags. Taking refocussed liberties by stocking up on foods requiring little to no refrigeration by storing well in the summer months like boxed milk, Juice Boxes, alcohol (for the adults or relayed vebal consent) chocolates, gummy bears, nachos and popcorn. Initially, when I picked this movie up, I  thought that it would make for obvious great kiddie fare, but it turned out to be too scary. In fact, most of the kids would leave very ill. This just isn't something that I can honestly refer to other concerned parents.",1,Movie is too scary for kids,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,2167,"['few', 'months', 'had', 'completely', 'overhaul', 'business', 'Blowman', 'Bus', 'Indeed', 'coming', 'investigation', 'department', 'health', 'seemed', 'best', 'way', 'further', 'avoid', 'unnecessary', 'investigations', 'paperwork', 'was', 'simply', 'change', 'business', 'plan', 'Too', 'many', 'parents', 'had', 'problem', 'mobile', 'petting', 'zoo', 'ice', 'cream', 'shop', 'ran', 'renovated', 'seatless', 'school', 'bus.With', 'formal', 'refrigeration', 'say', 'other', 'coolers', 'picked', 'up', 'clearance', 'Lowes', 'Remotely', 'might', 'see', 'why', 'parents', 'might', 'complain', 'Most', ""'normal"", 'kids', 'do', 'not', 'eat', 'ice', 'cream', 'freezer', 'still', 'had', 'issue', 'that.As', 'mobile', 'petting', 'zoo', 'think', 'were', 'line', 'paying', 'small', 'fare', 'individuals', 'tour', 'groups', 'would', 'load', 'up', 'bus', 'drive', 'town', 'Many', 'older', 'sickly', 'animals', 'were', 'donated', 'shelters', 'others', 'would', 'find', 'drove', 'about', 'most', 'part', 'animals', 'were', 'well-mannered', 'Keeping', 'cages', 'moving', 'bus', 'seemed', 'rather', 'pointless', 'simply', 'cruel', 'areas', 'were', 'clearly', 'marked', 'colored', 'signs.You', ""'re"", 'welcome', 'PETA.If', 'when', 'animals', 'started', 'get', 'slightly', 'agitated', 'kids', 'would', 'break', 'out', 'first', 'aid', 'kit', 'Then', 'simply', 'look', 'place', 'pull', 'bus', 'let', 'animal', 'out', 'Preferably', 'well-populated', 'area', 'front', 'school', 'grocery', 'store', 'freeway', 'someone', 'else', 'find', 'care', 'it.Now', 'bus', 'still', 'smelling', 'animal', 'kennel', 'been', 'converted', 'mobile', 'movie', 'theater', 'blacked', 'out', 'windows', 'soap', 'spray', 'paint', 'duct', 'taped', 'few', 'chairs', 'tables', 'couches', 'bean/dude', 'bags', 'Taking', 'refocussed', 'liberties', 'stocking', 'up', 'foods', 'requiring', 'little', 'refrigeration', 'storing', 'well', 'summer', 'months', 'boxed', 'milk', 'Juice', 'Boxes', 'alcohol', 'adults', 'relayed', 'vebal', 'consent', 'gummy', 'bears', 'nachos', 'popcorn', 'Initially', 'when', 'picked', 'movie', 'up', 'thought', 'would', 'make', 'obvious', 'great', 'kiddie', 'fare', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'too', 'scary', 'fact', 'most', 'kids', 'would', 'leave', 'very', 'ill', 'just', ""n't"", 'something', 'can', 'honestly', 'refer', 'other', 'concerned', 'parents']",N/A

My poor Mom took me and my sister to see &#34;Psycho&#34; during it's initial run in theaters in 1960, I believe. I was 6 years old at the time and loved &#34;monster&#34; movies, and &#34;scary&#34; movies. She, and my sister and I, had no idea what we were in for. The original &#34;Night of the Living Dead&#34; was a grim, gut-wrenching hour and a half that left me and the rest of the Saturday afternoon matinee kids shell-shocked when I was about 13 or 14 years old.I watched &#34;Toy Story of Terror&#34; during its run on the Disney Channel during the Halloween season with my grownup children, and with a 5- and 8-year old brother and sister foster kids. Needless to say, we all loved it, and the little ones wanted to watch it each time it was broadcast. Sure it was scary, but in a &#34;Scooby-Do&#34; kind of way, and that's the fun of it. I will be ordering at least two copies of &#34;Toy Story of Terror,&#34; one for the kids and one for me.

When it comes to movies like Toy Story........well, ''Its like the very air I breathe,'' says I. ''I simply cannot live without it, nobody can''.
