The song was not bad but went on way too long.  I wish there was some way to skip that part of a really good DVD.  I love Ernie and Signature Sound.

1192467,A3D3AYY2YTWEVB,B001FZ6QX4,Mickey Thorne,"[4, 5]","This is different from the other videos by this group.  Over all, it is calming, but still has humor.  The songs are good, and the new pianist is great, (but I miss Roy nonetheless), I loved some of the arrangements of old songs, and the inserted photo clips are most appropriate. It seems to me that these guys sing better and better as time goes on.  I went to a concert in Beaverton, where they performed some of the songs on this album.  There were about twenty of us, and we all enjoyed the evening. I was made even more aware of what a great group of guys these singers are. I was so glad to see them perform in person, and to meet them. A few days afterward, I bought this album, and, just like the previous two, (I bought before I had ever seen them perform), I love it.I would say: If Get Away Jordan is too much for you, you would probably like this one. But then, of course, if you love Get Away Jordan, I think you would still like having one that is different. Very creative!  Doug does one song that is similar -in a way- to a Gene Autry-type western, and he does it so well. Actually, I was a bit surprised, as Doug did not seem the type, (but what do I know)?  This quartet can sing anything, and Tim seems less shy, and was fun to watch. He is a good guy in person too. They all are. Great Disc; I am happy to own it, and love to share it. God bless us one and all.If you decide to get it, I sincerely hope that you too will enjoy it.Mickey",4,good listening gospel music,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,1457,"['different', 'other', 'videos', 'group', 'calming', 'still', 'humor', 'songs', 'are', 'good', 'new', 'pianist', 'great', 'miss', 'Roy', 'nonetheless', 'loved', 'arrangements', 'old', 'songs', 'inserted', 'photo', 'clips', 'are', 'most', 'appropriate', 'guys', 'sing', 'better', 'better', 'time', 'went', 'concert', 'Beaverton', 'where', 'performed', 'songs', 'album', 'were', 'twenty', 'enjoyed', 'evening', 'was', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'aware', 'what', 'great', 'group', 'guys', 'singers', 'are', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'see', 'perform', 'person', 'meet', 'few', 'days', 'afterward', 'bought', 'album', 'just', 'previous', 'two', 'bought', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'perform', 'love', 'it.I', 'would', 'say', 'Get', 'Away', 'Jordan', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'probably', 'one', 'then', 'course', 'love', 'Get', 'Away', 'Jordan', 'think', 'would', 'still', 'having', 'one', 'different', 'Very', 'creative', 'Doug', 'one', 'song', 'similar', 'way-', 'Gene', 'Autry-type', 'western', 'so', 'well', 'Actually', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'Doug', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'type', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'quartet', 'can', 'sing', 'anything', 'Tim', 'less', 'shy', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'good', 'guy', 'person', 'too', 'are', 'Great', 'Disc', 'am', 'happy', 'own', 'love', 'share', 'God', 'bless', 'one', 'all.If', 'decide', 'get', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'too', 'will', 'enjoy', 'it.Mickey']",N/A
