I am an avid David Lynch and Charlie Kaufman fan so these types of films tend to appeal to me. However Cosmopolis was a lifeless film, it was an audiobook with pictures. I was 30 minutes into the film asking myself when will the film actually begin. The acting is monotone and when I mean monotone I mean the actors including the main character all speak like the agents in the matrix, there is no chemistry or engagements between the characters, almost like they could all be CGI talking to blue screens, most of the time they are not even looking at one another while speaking. I understand capitalism is a machine and that could be a minor explanation for the dialogue but it just does not engage the viewer one bit. It kind of reminds me of the film Waking Life but lacking in any substantial existential realizations. Paul Giamatti's 15 minute performance at the end was suberb and probably left a lasting impression on some to give it a favorable review. However this performance does not amend the fact that you just spent an hour and a half listening to dialogue as monotone as a GPS indicator and watching actors just reading lines out loud as if they were reading the script for the first time. The artistic qualities of this film have eluded me, if one finds mathematics to be an art then this film may appeal to you otherwise this film is 2 hours of wasted existence.

The Idea of the film was interesting BUT...(and I feel so disloyal for saying this) I have long suspected that Robert Pattinson was not very intelligent, he giggles during interviews and looks down at his shoes-alot. The woman he chooses to be with is shallow and inarticulate-just when people are starting to like her again, she opens her mouth and says something stupid and arrogant, when she is not dropping the F-Bomb three times in each sentence. My point is- an intelligent man would need to be with someone who had some depth to them. He is beautiful to look at and was born to play Edward Cullen (as Christopher Reeves was born to play Superman) sometimes an actor and a role just ""click"" But I'm afraid he just didn't have the intellectual depth to make this role work, he was outclassed (and out -acted ) by every single person who got into that car! Most (not all) of the people in the film were robotic and talked in a monotone  ,I understand this was done for effect -but in R-Patz case, he did it because there wasn't a single thought rolling around in that gorgeous head of his  and you could see it in his eyes. An actor was needed who could act cold and  removed -  emotionally and morally bankrupt, yet convey that there were oceans of seething emotions going on underneath all that cold detachment. Robert ( I'm saddened to say) was badly out of his depth. The stilted dialog just didn't work and was laughably bad at times.

1590219,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B009AMABH6,DanD,"[3, 7]","To say that COSMOPOLIS isn't for everyone doesn't quite capture it.  This is a film whose plot, such as it is, basically hinges around the value of Chinese currency.  Its central character, young businessman Eric Packer, spends most of the movie in his limo, on his quest across New York City in order to get a haircut that he doesn't really need.In other words: Robert Pattinson's legions of TWILIGHT fans should steer clear.  Not that they will.As far as Pattinson goes, he's aptly cast.  He's able to radiate an emotional detachment, even when he's conveying a sense of ironic enjoyment at the downturn events are taking.  (The best comparison I can think of is Keanu Reeves in THE MATRIX: an actor who, talent or lack thereof aside, was perfect for the part; that being said, Pattinson actually does have some acting talent up his sleeve, and shows it here.)  The supporting cast--featuring Jay Baruchel, Sarah Gadon, Samantha Morton, Juliette Binoche, Mathieu Amalric, Paul Giamatti, and others--rotates in and out, each shining in their own, Cronenberg-influenced way.This is definitely David Cronenberg's film; in fact, it's the first film in years that feels reminiscent of the Cronenberg of the 70s and 80s.  He takes Dom DeLillo's basically unfilmable little novel and translates it beautifully to the screen.  The film founders a bit in spots (it's a tad too long for such an intimate, moral story), and comes off as too didactic in other spots.  Of course, that's the point; there's rarely anything subtle about a Cronenberg film, and COSMOPOLIS is a shining example.  It's certainly not for everyone; but for those who dare to enter Cronenberg's devious imagination, there's a real treat to be found here.",4,"A stark, nihilistic attack on capitalism.",1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,1718,"['say', 'COSMOPOLIS', ""n't"", 'everyone', ""n't"", 'quite', 'capture', 'film', 'plot', 'such', 'basically', 'value', 'Chinese', 'currency', 'central', 'character', 'young', 'businessman', 'Eric', 'Packer', 'most', 'movie', 'limo', 'quest', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'order', 'get', 'haircut', ""n't"", 'really', 'need.In', 'other', 'words', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'legions', 'TWILIGHT', 'fans', 'should', 'steer', 'clear', 'Not', 'will.As', 'far', 'Pattinson', 'aptly', 'cast', 'able', 'radiate', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'even', 'when', 'conveying', 'sense', 'ironic', 'enjoyment', 'downturn', 'events', 'are', 'taking', 'best', 'comparison', 'can', 'think', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'actor', 'who', 'talent', 'lack', 'thereof', 'aside', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'being', 'said', 'Pattinson', 'actually', 'have', 'acting', 'talent', 'sleeve', 'here', 'supporting', 'cast', 'featuring', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'Sarah', 'Gadon', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'Mathieu', 'Amalric', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'others', 'shining', 'own', 'Cronenberg-influenced', 'way.This', 'definitely', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'film', 'fact', 'first', 'film', 'years', 'feels', 'reminiscent', 'Cronenberg', '70s', '80s', 'Dom', 'DeLillo', 'basically', 'unfilmable', 'little', 'novel', 'beautifully', 'screen', 'film', 'founders', 'bit', 'spots', 'tad', 'too', 'long', 'such', 'intimate', 'moral', 'story', 'off', 'too', 'didactic', 'other', 'spots', 'course', 'point', 'rarely', 'anything', 'subtle', 'Cronenberg', 'film', 'COSMOPOLIS', 'shining', 'example', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone', 'who', 'dare', 'enter', 'Cronenberg', 'devious', 'imagination', 'real', 'treat', 'be', 'found', 'here']",Cosmopolis

1590221,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,B009AMABH6,Dave,"[5, 11]","For reasons I may not have yet fully analyzed, I was drawn into Cosmopolis from the very beginning and it commanded my attention to the very end.  I cannot think of another film in recent memory that has held my interest at such a high level for its duration.  I may take a bit of a different view of its message.  I believe it is about a highly intelligent and successful financial/economic modeler who has made a large fortune predicting the price movement of investments.  His predictions are made using highly sophisticated computer analysis of vast amounts of information leading to ""nanosecond"" timing of investment decisions.  While he employs and consults with others, it is clear that he is the brain upon which his success was achieved.  His problem is that his financial models are run in a vacuum relative to human existence and accordingly, his life has been spent in a financial future that does not yet exist, except within his models, and it indeed may never exist outside his models.  Because his models lack any regard for humanity and his continuous view of the future is unreal, he eventually becomes depressed and sociopathic.  However, he has some recognition of what the lack of real human involvement is doing to him and begins to seek out human contact and input, but it may be too late.  He also knows that the manner in which he, and others, have made their fortunes has had a significant negative impact on society because it ignores any human impact.  The movie begins on a day when he has made unusually large investments based upon a predicted currency price outcome which could cause the collapse of his empire if he does not make a decision contrary to his model's predicted result.  I believe much of the film deals with the contradictions between a sociopath and his need for human contact and that his models do not model human existence.  I do not know if this is the gist of the filmmaker's intent, but this seemed to me to be a plausible scenario supported in varying degrees by the film's dialog and visual content.I think Cosmopolis captured and held my attention so strongly because of my financial/economic background and the less evident underlying truths upon which the economic scenario of the film appeared to be built.  However, the film is not straightforward in its disclosure of details leading me to this view so I will not pretend to profess any ""correct"" understanding if one indeed exists.  There are reviews of this film that are negative because others found it to be too different, too difficult or lacking a plot and accordingly, the film did not capture their attention as strongly as mine.  While I may not have realized the filmmakers' intent, I remain confident that many viewers will find that it has substance beyond what those reviewers perceived.The best adjective I could come up with to describe the film is ""interesting"".  It is far different from the average popular fare and its dialog may be difficult to grasp occasionally, but I thought Robert Pattison did a good job with a good but difficult script.  I did not notice any other significant artistic or technical pluses or minuses.  I rented this movie from Amazon and renters do not get the benefit of additional materials that may be included on the purchased DVD.  I do not usually view much of the additional materials supplied with DVDs because I usually do not need to have a film explained to me and I hold no fanatical interest.  But, in the case of Cosmopolis, some additional material concerning the film's substance might be helpful.  If you are looking for some lighter entertainment, this film does not meet your need.  However, if you happen to be in a pensive or analytical frame of mind, I would recommend Cosmopolis for at least one viewing.  I think it was a very good film.",4,Interesting,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,3818,"['reasons', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'yet', 'fully', 'analyzed', 'was', 'drawn', 'Cosmopolis', 'very', 'beginning', 'commanded', 'attention', 'very', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'recent', 'memory', 'held', 'interest', 'high', 'level', 'duration', 'may', 'take', 'bit', 'different', 'view', 'message', 'believe', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'successful', 'financial/economic', 'modeler', 'who', 'made', 'large', 'fortune', 'predicting', 'price', 'movement', 'investments', 'predictions', 'are', 'made', 'using', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'computer', 'analysis', 'vast', 'amounts', 'information', 'leading', 'nanosecond', 'timing', 'investment', 'decisions', 'consults', 'others', 'clear', 'brain', 'success', 'was', 'achieved', 'problem', 'financial', 'models', 'are', 'run', 'vacuum', 'relative', 'human', 'existence', 'accordingly', 'life', 'been', 'spent', 'financial', 'future', 'not', 'yet', 'exist', 'models', 'indeed', 'may', 'never', 'exist', 'models', 'models', 'lack', 'regard', 'humanity', 'continuous', 'view', 'future', 'unreal', 'eventually', 'depressed', 'sociopathic', 'However', 'recognition', 'what', 'lack', 'real', 'human', 'involvement', 'doing', 'seek', 'out', 'human', 'contact', 'input', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'also', 'manner', 'others', 'have', 'made', 'fortunes', 'had', 'significant', 'negative', 'impact', 'society', 'human', 'impact', 'movie', 'day', 'when', 'made', 'unusually', 'large', 'investments', 'based', 'predicted', 'currency', 'price', 'outcome', 'could', 'cause', 'collapse', 'empire', 'not', 'make', 'decision', 'contrary', 'model', 'predicted', 'result', 'believe', 'much', 'film', 'deals', 'contradictions', 'sociopath', 'need', 'human', 'contact', 'models', 'do', 'not', 'model', 'human', 'existence', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'gist', 'filmmaker', 'intent', 'seemed', 'be', 'plausible', 'scenario', 'supported', 'varying', 'degrees', 'film', 'dialog', 'visual', 'content.I', 'think', 'Cosmopolis', 'captured', 'held', 'attention', 'so', 'strongly', 'financial/economic', 'background', 'less', 'evident', 'underlying', 'truths', 'economic', 'scenario', 'film', 'appeared', 'be', 'built', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'straightforward', 'disclosure', 'details', 'leading', 'view', 'will', 'not', 'pretend', 'profess', 'correct', 'understanding', 'one', 'indeed', 'are', 'reviews', 'film', 'are', 'negative', 'others', 'found', 'be', 'too', 'different', 'too', 'difficult', 'lacking', 'plot', 'accordingly', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'capture', 'attention', 'as', 'strongly', 'mine', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'realized', 'filmmakers', 'intent', 'remain', 'confident', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'substance', 'what', 'reviewers', 'perceived.The', 'best', 'adjective', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'describe', 'film', 'interesting', 'far', 'different', 'average', 'popular', 'fare', 'dialog', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'grasp', 'occasionally', 'thought', 'Robert', 'Pattison', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'good', 'difficult', 'script', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'other', 'significant', 'artistic', 'technical', 'pluses', 'minuses', 'rented', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'renters', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'benefit', 'additional', 'materials', 'may', 'be', 'included', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'usually', 'view', 'much', 'additional', 'materials', 'supplied', 'DVDs', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'have', 'film', 'explained', 'hold', 'fanatical', 'interest', 'case', 'Cosmopolis', 'additional', 'material', 'concerning', 'film', 'substance', 'might', 'be', 'helpful', 'are', 'looking', 'lighter', 'entertainment', 'film', 'not', 'meet', 'need', 'However', 'happen', 'be', 'pensive', 'analytical', 'frame', 'mind', 'would', 'recommend', 'Cosmopolis', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', 'think', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film']",Cosmopolis

There's still a lot I don't get, which is all right because that's the sort of film it is: You don't have to savor every detail, bit of conflict, or other nuance in order to feel like you've been taken somewhere quite unusual, and new things will pop up with each view.The quality of the filming, acting, and everything else ranges from good to impeccable. There are many interesting characters and changes in scenery, and plenty of unexpected and often very amusing stuff happens. Nevertheless, COSMOPOLIS is driven more by ideas (conveyed mostly through dialogue)than plot or character. There are all kinds of multiple themes here: desire/greed, love/sex, creation/destruction, and it often raises the question of whether certain dual concepts that we tend to consider antonymous are actually synonymous extensions of one another. COSMOPOLIS is full of symbols: Without reaching too far, one can interpret the various details in a variety of different ways.A lot's been said about what a strange movie this is, and, well, if you like ""strange,"" you'll probably like COSMOPOLIS. The whole flavor of the film could be described as surreal or, perhaps, realistically cartoonish. For some reason, it reminded me a bit of the film adaptations of Vonnegut's novels (SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, HARRISON BERGERON, et al), not to mention BATMAN.Having said all this, I can understand why people who strongly favor realistic, action-oriented drama will probably NOT like COSMOPOLIS.

Some reviewers have loved it; others loathed it for its basic plotlessness, its static action and lengthy passages of dialogue. Basically a reflection on living in a capitalist society, the film centers on Eric Packer (Robert Pattinson) living through a single day and moving from a position of security to one of relative instability. During that time he encounters a variety of characters, including some of his fellow-speculators, a barber who knew his father, and a deus ex machina figure forcing him to reflect on the consequences of living in a money-obsessed world. The film has a morality-play feel about it, with Packer as the representative of humankind enduring a series of encounters that expose some of the unwelcome aspects of life to him. Stylistically the film is quite repetitive; most of the action takes place in claustrophobic interiors, and the basic shot/reverse shot structure is employed during most of the conversational exchanges. This is deliberate on director David Cronenberg's part, as he tries to find an appropriate style to portray a world dedicated to repetitive ritual in which such things as emotion, spontaneity and chance had been squeezed out.

1590239,A328S9RN3U5M68,B009AMABH6,Grady Harp,"[2, 5]","In trying to figure out why this film By David Cronenberg fails to work it is probably best to return to the original novel of the same name by Don DeLillo. The story's  themes - `power, technology, violence, terrorism, crowds, the movements and counter-movements of contemporary culture - are those of White Noise, Libra and Mao II. The setting, a contemporary yet futuristic New York, is familiar terrain. Stylistically, too, it's business as usual. The protagonist Eric Packer isn't someone we're meant to engage with. A running motif is his contempt for last week's big thing, especially technology. Skyscrapers, airports, phones, walkie-talkies, personal computers, vestibules, automated teller machines, assassination attempts on presidents: he finds them all comically outdated. His own gadgetry, with its flashing monitors and flowing numbers, works in another time-frame, bringing events before they happen and giving them a sharpness they lack in ""real life"". Doubt and ambiguity aren't concepts he understands. He sees himself as the future - and thinks that when he dies the world will end, not him. Packer is less a character than a cypher, a symbol of dystopian triumphalism. If he doesn't seem ""believable"" or ""realistic"", so be it: the words have no meaning in the world he inhabits.'So given the cerebral dysfunction of the novel, it is a bit easier to cope with the ennui of this film. Riding across Manhattan in a stretch limo in order to get a haircut, Eric Packer (Robert Pattinson, in a monotone, phoned in `performance'), a 28-year-old billionaire asset manager's day devolves into an odyssey with a cast of characters that start to tear his world apart. The characters are basically tropes that are attempted to be inhabited by such fine actors as Samantha Morton, Juliette Binouche, Sarah Gadon, Paul Giamatti, Juliette Binoche, Kevin Durand, Mathieu Amalric, Jay Baruchel, etc. The film begs indulgence on the audience's part and it takes a certain mindset to make it through to the end.

1590244,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B009AMABH6,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[2, 6]","From the moment I heard that Robert Pattinson, he of the sparkly vampires of TWILIGHT, had been cast as the lead in David Cronenberg's adaptation of Don Delillo's COSMOPOLIS, I knew immediately that this would be a polarizing film, and judging by the critical response and the response here, it certainly lived up to that expectation. What I didn't expect, though, is that R-Patz would be so compelling in this film, and that the film itself would be more of a return to Cronenberg's earlier career before he started making more &#34;Oscar-Caliber&#34; films like A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, EASTERN PROMISES and A DANGEROUS METHOD. COSMOPOLIS is a film that reminded me of the hallucinatory semi-futurist setting of his classic VIDEODROME, in which the hybridization of humans and technology worked to create a revolution. Here, as we follow young multi-billionaire Eric Packer (Pattinson) in his ultra-high-tech limo through the streets of New York on his way across town to get a haircut, we see not a physical transformation, but rather a mental and almost spiritual transformation as his odyssey through the streets and the people lead toward a finale of inevitability.Packer is betting his fortune against the Chinese form of currency falling, but it's not happening yet, and he is losing millions. He also is informed by his security detail that there is a potential threat on his life. But this is all just dressing for the meat of the film, which are the several liasons with different people he has throughout the day in his limo on his trek across town. He meets with his tech guru (Jay Baruschel), a seemingly teenaged currency genius (Philip Nozuka), a sexual liason with a beautiful woman (Juliette Binoche), a daily visit from a doctor which leads to a hilarious and uncomforable scene between himself and another underling (Emily Hampshire), a discussion with a technological futurist (Samantha Morton), and more as he continually meets with his new and very wealthy bride (Sarah Gadon) to share a meal with her. All of this continues pressing on throughout a sometimes clean and shiny streetscape and a sometimes frightening hellscape as anti-capitalist protesters run amok in the streets, and it's likely that one of them could be the threat against Packer's life. More sex and shocking violence occurs as the night comes to a close, and Packer finds himself face to face with his real assassin, played by Paul Giamatti.What's so striking about this film is also the reason that people looking for an old-fashioned entertaining night of watching a film will be disappointed, and that is the monologues and one-on-one dialogue exchanges throughout the film, primarily taking place in Packer's limo. The film has a great deal to say about society, technology, nature, and humanity, but none of it is set or said in a particularly realistic fashion. The hyper-stylized dialogue is like honey in your ears as it constantly flows, and the performances are compelling, dark and stripped-down in a way that only an independent film can do AND make work. Pattinson is quite good as Packer, a young man who seems like he's already lived most of his life and accomplished most of his goals. Part of what is so fascinating about Packer is how lifeless he seems, even when he's living on the edge of reason. He takes what he wants when he wants it without any thought or care about the consequences. Even his own psyche is as sterile and as ordered as the interior of his limo, until he leaves it, which is when he begins to crack. Most of the other actors who populate the film are passers-by, who are not whole characters but rather reflections or representations of parts of his mind, but that doesn't diminish their presence. Standing out here, though, is Giamatti as the crazed funhouse mirror of Packer, who has focused every element of his life into killing Packer. His performance here is almost self-parody of a sort.

1590250,A1RM3SHEBUDPI9,B009AMABH6,J. Pallow,"[8, 18]","There will be spoilers. This was my take on the film and just a little bit of what I took away from it. First of all, I loved this movie.  Another reviewer on here said that no one can describe what its about because its about so many things. I completely agree. Essentially, the main character is Eric Packer a multi-billionaire whos desperate to get across town to his fathers old barber. Along the way he meets with people, either employees, business associates,security personel, and his new bride whom he married for circumstance and not love. Hes a young man of 28 and for his age hes acheived much. But you get the sense that hes lost, he doesnt understand his place in the world and he thinks that somehow if he re lives a part of his life and remembers his innocence he will somehow understand his purpose.Thus, trying to go to the barber. A place of happy memories for him. Now the real meat of the story of which makes this film so interesting ; comes from all the characters he meets on his journey to the barber. They all have thier own point of view on how the world works, how its ever changing and never receding to simpler times. As technology advances, humans become more dull and dependant on the things they want rather than need. to have those things you need money. The world is obsessed with money and it makes us less human because of it. We become greedy and careless of others, we lose touch with humanity and what we should be. Since Eric has so much money he is in all actually a perfect example of what the problems with society are. When he finally meets up with a former employee named Benno Levin, he for the first time hears and at least trys to understand what its like for those of us who struggle while the rich lose touch with humanity. By this point he seems so desperate to feel some kind of emotional response to the activities,turmoil of the day he would do anything to just FEEL. Thus shooting himself in the hand. The film ends with Benno pointing a gun at the back of Erics head. We dont know if he shot Eric or not. I do know Eric didnt seem to worried about the fact that he could die. Throughout the whole movie you are trying to understand this man, why is he so paranoid that he gets a prostate exam daily? why cant he make a connection with his wife? why does it seem the only thing he does have feeling for is sex? Especially,whenthe animalistic nature of sex is for the reason to pro-create and yet,I find that ironic since he seems so morbidly curious about death; having heard about the death of a famous recording artist he favored and then later killing his body gaurd and feeling nothing.  Like I said theres so much going on in this film that every time you watch it you will come away having learned something new. Each character reveals to us a little nugget of truth about society and what we are becoming. Remember that was just my take on the film having watched it one time and reading the book twice. I do feel like this film is not really for entertainment purposes. I mean its entertaining to watch the actors performances. They are all just amazing and fabulously talented. But you really have to pay attention to dialogue in this film. You have to watch it will an open mind and open ears. Visually I really liked the cinematography. The limo was multifunctional. I was unsure how they could make each scene special when the characters are in one space for so long. But it works. i definitely reccomend it. Its not a blockbuster but if you want a taste of something different then what hollywood is churnning out, then Give Cosmopolis a try.",5,not for entertainment but thought provoking,1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,3610,"['will', 'be', 'spoilers', 'was', 'take', 'film', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'what', 'took', 'away', 'First', 'loved', 'movie', 'reviewer', 'here', 'said', 'one', 'can', 'describe', 'what', 'about', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'completely', 'agree', 'Essentially', 'main', 'character', 'Eric', 'Packer', 'multi-billionaire', 'whos', 'desperate', 'get', 'town', 'fathers', 'old', 'barber', 'way', 'people', 'employees', 'business', 'associates', 'security', 'personel', 'new', 'bride', 'whom', 'married', 'circumstance', 'not', 'love', 'Hes', 'young', 'man', '28', 'age', 'acheived', 'much', 'get', 'sense', 'lost', 'understand', 'place', 'world', 'somehow', 'part', 'life', 'remembers', 'innocence', 'will', 'somehow', 'understand', 'purpose.Thus', 'trying', 'go', 'barber', 'place', 'happy', 'memories', 'Now', 'real', 'meat', 'story', 'film', 'so', 'interesting', 'characters', 'journey', 'barber', 'have', 'thier', 'own', 'point', 'view', 'how', 'world', 'how', 'ever', 'changing', 'never', 'receding', 'simpler', 'times', 'technology', 'advances', 'become', 'more', 'dull', 'dependant', 'things', 'want', 'rather', 'need', 'have', 'things', 'need', 'money', 'world', 'obsessed', 'money', 'less', 'human', 'become', 'greedy', 'careless', 'others', 'lose', 'touch', 'humanity', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'Eric', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'actually', 'perfect', 'example', 'what', 'problems', 'society', 'are', 'When', 'finally', 'up', 'former', 'employee', 'named', 'Benno', 'Levin', 'first', 'time', 'hears', 'least', 'trys', 'understand', 'what', 'like', 'who', 'struggle', 'rich', 'lose', 'touch', 'humanity', 'point', 'so', 'desperate', 'feel', 'kind', 'emotional', 'response', 'activities', 'turmoil', 'day', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'just', 'FEEL', 'Thus', 'shooting', 'hand', 'film', 'Benno', 'pointing', 'gun', 'back', 'Erics', 'head', 'dont', 'know', 'Eric', 'not', 'do', 'know', 'Eric', 'didnt', 'seem', 'worried', 'fact', 'could', 'die', 'whole', 'movie', 'are', 'trying', 'understand', 'man', 'why', 'so', 'prostate', 'exam', 'daily', 'why', 'cant', 'make', 'connection', 'wife', 'why', 'seem', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'feeling', 'sex', 'Especially', 'whenthe', 'animalistic', 'nature', 'sex', 'reason', 'pro-create', 'yet', 'find', 'ironic', 'so', 'morbidly', 'curious', 'death', 'having', 'heard', 'death', 'famous', 'recording', 'artist', 'favored', 'then', 'later', 'killing', 'body', 'gaurd', 'feeling', 'nothing', 'said', 'theres', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'film', 'time', 'watch', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'having', 'learned', 'something', 'new', 'character', 'reveals', 'little', 'nugget', 'truth', 'society', 'what', 'are', 'becoming', 'Remember', 'was', 'just', 'take', 'film', 'having', 'watched', 'one', 'time', 'reading', 'book', 'twice', 'do', 'feel', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'mean', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'actors', 'performances', 'are', 'just', 'amazing', 'fabulously', 'talented', 'really', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'dialogue', 'film', 'have', 'watch', 'will', 'open', 'mind', 'open', 'ears', 'Visually', 'really', 'liked', 'cinematography', 'limo', 'was', 'multifunctional', 'was', 'unsure', 'how', 'could', 'make', 'scene', 'special', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'one', 'space', 'so', 'long', 'i', 'definitely', 'reccomend', 'not', 'blockbuster', 'want', 'taste', 'something', 'different', 'then', 'what', 'hollywood', 'churnning', 'out', 'then', 'Give', 'Cosmopolis', 'try']",Cosmopolis

1590252,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009AMABH6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[43, 60]","From the strange to the sublime, few filmmakers have fascinated me more than David Cronenberg.  The Canadian auteur has made some of my all time favorites, and his distinctive sense of macabre humor and his skewed world view is in evidence even in his most mainstream work.  With a string of great films that included Scanners, Videodrome, The Dead Zone, The Fly and Dead Ringers, he earned a nickname (a personal favorite) as the King of Venereal Horror.  But not to limit himself to genre work, he also scored accolades for his interpretation of Naked Lunch, A History of Violence, and Eastern Promises.  I love Cronenberg in case you couldn't tell!  Even his less successful pictures courted big ideas (Existenz, Spider) and/or great shock value (Crash).  Say what you will, Cronenberg makes the films he wants to make and to heck with anyone else!  I have to respect that.  That is a large preface to discussing his latest effort ""Cosmopolis,"" which in my estimation is a film that will elicit strong reactions from its viewers in both the negative and the positive sense.  Adapting Don DeLillo's novel of the same name, the film unravels like a surreal (and utterly deadpan) dream as society teeters on the brink of anarchy.Robert Pattinson veers about as far away from his Twilight role as one movie will allow.  I appreciate that he wants to stretch as an actor and Cronenberg is notoriously good with his performers (Jeremy Irons' best work is in Dead Ringers and Jeff Goldblum was never better than in The Fly).  Pattinson plays a financial genius who is betting his company's fortune on the day's events.  In the midst of increasing turmoil, however, he becomes obsessed with riding across town to seek out a barber from his past.  The cityscape as he travels very slowly in his limo is decidedly dystopian with riots and confrontations brewing.  Along the way, Pattinson holds court with various people who drop into and out of his car.  Among the bigger names that he encounters through the course of this day are Juliette Binoche, Samantha Morton, and Paul Giamatti.  The movie is basically made up of random scenes and discussions that directly relate to our fascination with money, power, technology, and information.  As the movie progresses, however, these themes lead to greater violence and even revolution.  It is a cerebral exercise as much as a movie experience.  There is a fair chance that you will be intrigued by its ideas, but an equal proportion of viewers will find the experience lacking.  I suspect there will be little middle ground.For my taste, ""Cosmopolis"" falls into the interesting failure category in Cronenberg's filmography.  The movie has a purposeful chilliness and remoteness that can make every conversation seem like it is in monotone.  There is a certain humor underlying the proceedings, and the movie does work as a deadpan satire.  It is an unrepentantly bleak indictment of modern society and its values.  Some of the character interactions are quite entertaining, some are a bit more perplexing.  There are a lot of significant points to ponder, but the screenplay tends to handle most matters with a fairly heavy hand.  By the time things start escalating out of control, I found myself not caring very much.  And the big payoff comes in the form of a confrontation with a lively Giamatti (after all the stilted talk, Giamatti appears as if in a different movie altogether).  But even this moment never really satisfies.  ""Cosmopolis"" was interesting, to say the least, but I simply found that some of its parts were stronger than it as a whole.  Not conventional in any sense, this may be a love-it or hate-it proposition.  As a huge Cronenberg fanatic, I ended up being strangely apathetic.

This is also one of the more interesting films of the year, a film that deserves repeat viewings, in order to, get into the mindset of the film itself.",5,"""Cosmopolis"" is great!",1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,1878,"['Cosmopolis', 'great', 'how', 'story', '28-year-old', 'financial', 'wizard', 'billionaire', 'Eric', 'Packer', 'Manhattan', 'stretch', 'limo', 'goal', 'haircut', 'Anthony', 'father', 'old', 'barber', 'day', 'driver', 'navigate', 'presidential', 'visit', 'attack', 'anarchists', 'rapper', 'funeral', 'Stuck', 'traffic', 'anxiously', 'value', 'yen', 'limo', 'computer.The', 'cast', 'led', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Eric', 'Packer', 'great', 'directing', 'screenplay', 'based', 'novel', 'Don', 'DeLillo', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'great.The', 'music', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'performed', 'Metric', 'great', 'cinematography', 'Peter', 'Suschitzky', 'great', 'film', 'editing', 'Ronald', 'Sanders', 'great', 'casting', 'Deirdre', 'Bowen', 'great', 'production', 'design', 'Arvinder', 'Grewal', 'set', 'designs', 'Matt', 'Middleton', 'Brad', 'Milburn', 'great', 'art', 'direction', 'Joshu', 'de', 'Cartier', 'great', 'costume', 'design', 'Denise', 'Cronenberg', 'great', 'make-up', 'design', 'Stephan', 'Dupuis', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'coordinated', 'Warren', 'Appleby', 'great', 'visual', 'effects', 'coordinated', 'Michael', 'DiCarlo', 'Naomi', 'Foakes', 'supervised', 'Wojciech', 'Zielinski', 'great', 'stunts', 'coordinated', 'John', 'Stoneham', 'Jr.', 'Layton', 'Morrison', 'great.This', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'film', 'think', 'also', 'well-made', 'well-crafted', 'film', 'also', 'interesting', 'film', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'who', 'definitely', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'directors', 'time', 'terms', 'different', 'genres', 'movies', 'done', 'past', '35+', 'years', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'subtly', 'interesting', 'performance', 'Eric', 'Packer', 'character', 'very', 'much', 'different', 'Twilight', 'character', 'Edward', 'terms', 'mindset', 'also', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'films', 'year', 'film', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'order', 'get', 'mindset', 'film']",Cosmopolis

The performances are all ratherly deliberatly deadpan, the dialogue is all very unnatural and the plot is one long series of small encounters after another. Cut down appropriately, it might actually be better as a play than a film.There is endless repetitive empty dialogue babbling about techology and money all with the spectre of ""the revolution"" lurking in the background. It gives the impression of being deep, but its all profoundly shallow. No particular insights are offered other than sort of a mindless heavy-handed tantrum against all modern life. When it runs out of empty words, the film is carried to a conclusion through violence. It doesn't even really end. It just ceases.Paul Giamatti gives by far the best performance in the film in whats probably the key role. It almost reminds me of ""heart of darkness"" in terms of plot played out in New York. Heart of Darkness usually fails as Drama because nobody can live up to being ""Kurtz"" toward the end. The film gets that part kind of right, but everything else wrong.The film is all style but no substance. All the characters are one-dimensional sockpuppets. It was interesting to watch because it was so unconventional, but its not a good film in any sense.One final note. The extras for this film are extremely interesting. There is a very long ""making of"" documentary that in some ways is better than the film itself. If its watched carefully, you can sort of figure out why the film turned out the way it did.The best bit of irony is listening to the director talk about the ""dehumanizing"" nature of technology as a theme in the film in terms of wall street. But he doesn't see how he himself has dehumanized the whole film process from treating his actors like machines to shooting his film almost entirely in a green screened digital world .... to trying to direct laying on a couch in his trailer.

Several events intervene, and that is when things starts to unravel, seemingly without sense or purpose.Several comments: to tell you that I am bewildred, and disappointed, by this movie, would be an understatement. Characters come and go, and it's hard to understand why. Juliette Binoche, who gets 2nd star lining in the movie just below Pattison, appears out of nowhere having sex with Packer in the limo and is in the movie for all of about 10 min. or so. Then there are the improbable, at times laughable lines. Such as Packer saying ""My prostate is asymmetrical"" to a woman, who responds ""What does that mean?"" and Packer responding ""I don't know"". And then later on Benni (played by Paul Giamatti) exclaiming ""I have my syndromes, you have your complexes. You did it to yourself!"", and on and on.

This is a film for the underachiever; the loser; the crank and the critic; this is a film for the 99 % and not for the 1 %. Rats are a unit of currency, and apparently, to Cronenberg, so are humans, who are basically, rats. To call this film hyperdystopic is to say the Titanic had a small leak. This is 1/3 David Lynch (the editing and the aesthetics), 1/3 David Mamet (the rapid-fire esoteric dialogue) and 1/3 Cronenberg (the opening sequence, thelast third of the film, and the ending). Only cab drivers and barbers escape Cronenberg's withering sardonic humour and sarcasm, as he jabs billionaires (played, almost effortlessly, by Robert Pattinson), bitchy wives, narcissistic men and women, lesbians (but who end up being smarter than their bosses), doctors, bodyguards, anti-globalists, Mark Rothko (his paintings prominently displayed in the closing credits),immigrants, guns, mental illness, sex, body odors, diners, agoraphobia, joggers, IT nerds, and even manages to insult rats, yes, rats. Lynchhas done this before (""Mulholland Drive"", ""Inland Empire"") and Robert Altman (""The Player""), but none of these were films about nihilism, about the eradication of reason and empathy, in the human soul. This film is a voyage through that eradication. If Cronenberg's brilliant ""Crash"" is one car crash (+ sex) after another, then ""Cosmopolis"" is one long crash (+ some sex). We just don't get to see the crash. This is a hilarious film without any laughter (and I did not laugh when I watched this film; quite the opposite). ""Gentlemen, what we have here, is a failure to communicate"". Yes, on practically every human level. The rats communicate more than the humans, who talk past each other,as they nurse their own personal demons, totally oblivious to any other human (except the barber and the cabbie turned bodyguard). Cronenberg has produced a map of nihilism and what it can, and does, do to the human soul, deprived of love, empathy, community, health, almost everything, but especially what society does to those who make too much money, and those who used to make too much money,and those, who make none at all. Why does an older generation Italian-American barber (former cabbie) bond with a middle-aged African immigrant (former cabbie), when all the middle-aged and younger White hedonists in Manhattan (Toronto as the actual site of filming) compete with each other to see, who is the most narcissistic ? We don't know, but Cronenberg seems to be saying something about race, age, profession and plunder, as different facets of human nature, but some are more humane than others. The nadir of Eric Packer's (Pattinson) journey, comes when he crosses self-pity with Richard Sheets aka Benno Levin, played with Academy Award-level quality, by Paul Giamatti. Levin (Sheets) used to work for Packer, but of course, Packer does not know him from Adam, as a CEO, he need not. Levin shoots at him, and Packer chases him down in his ""rathole"" apartment, a frightened, agoraphobic, mentally ill, man, who once stood for something important, but lost track of what it was. Packer reminds him of what it was, and Levin self-destructs, as he realizes that his life meant nothing, without his job, which he could not keep pace with. At the same time, Packer self-destructs in an orgy of narcissistic self-pity, only possibly exceeded by Levin's. Two men, one giant complex, and an asymmetric prostate. I will say no more, but the last 1/3 of the film is priceless. Both Pattinson and Giamatti are something to behold, as they try to outdo one another in self-victimhood and insanity. If you do not get this film, it is because, you are not SUPPOSED to get this film. You are supposed to feel this film and watch different facets of humanity claw their way, among the rats, for recognition and for empathy, totally incapable of generating any on their own. This is not, perhaps, Cronenberg's best film, or maybe it is (and, oh so many, to choose from). It is not didactic like ""Eastern Promises"", ""A History of Violence"" or ""A Dangerous Method"". It is the antithesis of ""eXistenZ"", the unwombing and unhybridizing of a man, who lives out of a white limousine (later, in the film, not so white), and doesn't even know how to bond with a rat. If you are a cynic, let alone, a nihilist, this film may or may not answer your questions or confirm your beliefs, but you will not forget this film for a long while, because Cronenberg does not want you to. And in that sense, Cronenberg himself, is as much the hedonist, as those he mocks, but he ISN'T out of a job.",5,A Rat is a Unit of Currency,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,5097,"['knew', 'was',

1590278,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B009AMABH6,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[2, 4]","Robert Pattison plays a role of 28 year old billionaire who has made his fortune playing the stock and currency market.  Almost the entire movie is filmed inside of his long, stretched limo where he seems to spend most of his time: meeting his business partners, hookers, friends, random people.  They talk about anarchy, money, information, art, music.  It is almost as if this young man with so much money has nothing better to do but prove that anything and everything can be bought.  As he plays the (stock) market, he suddenly decides to go across town and have a haircut in the old heighborhood where he grew up.  The old barber happens to be his father's friend and that is how we learn that this billionaire's father died when he was only five years old.  One cannot but wonder if his mathematical and methodical mind in an attempt to make sense of his fatherless childhood, prove that one can be successful (financially) even without male role model in his life.However it seems that this young man has something that he cannot buy.  His wife comes from old money and as crude and raw as he is, she is refined and cultured.  They are at odds because they seem to live on the opposite ends of the world.  He drives in a stretched limo, she takes a NYC cab around the city; his entertainment are random people that enter his limo while her world is solitude in the local bookstore; he is busy making love to women who are of questionable character while his wife goes to the theatre, elegant and quiet and the only hint of her distress is her attempt to smoke a cigarette which she does not even seem to enjoy.  His life is life of excess, her life is more measured, calm and orderly.  Their devide becomes apparent when he admits to her he is about to loose all of his money to the bet he made on the stock market against chinese yuen currency.  She  quietly offers him money so he can start fresh - in exchange for freedom (read divorce) he seems to crave.  It is only the expression on his face that makes viewer realize that this man would do anything to keep his wife, but the nature of their relationship give a whole new meaning to the term ""irreconcilable differences"".  For her, it is easy to explain her stand.  She says to him: ""I am not indifferent.  That makes me susceptable to pain.""As film progresses it almost seems that main character's internal turmoil is expressing itself with riots happening outside of his limo.  No one can make sense of it and other than anger and despair and resentment towards polarity that surrounds all protagonist - nothing particularly original.  It almost took me an hour before the film grabbed my full attention.  One action that the main character does changes the entire course of story and of course his destiny.  Seemingly with nothing left to loose: his marriage is over, his money is lost, he committs an act that is a statement that he gives up on his life; he finally decides to confront his stalker (played by Paul Giamatti) and that encounter I found somewhat disappointing.  However, the end will let you hanging and you can make you own choices on how all of these characters end up.  Subtle references to Erik Satie, Mike Rothko, anarchy and monks who set themselves to fire in order to make a (political or ideological) statement all leads us to one conclusion.  Here is a 28 year old man who has it all with nothing else left to prove.  For a man like that is there anything left in life he has not done, felt or experienced yet?

Eric is shielded from these events as his financial world goes to ruin. The world outside passes by almost in a surreal fashion and at times he blocks it out altogether.We have the destruction idea as Eric has bet against the Yuan, Chinese currency. The theory implies that China is the new empire built upon the ashes of our American empire. Don't bet against it.The people who enter Eric's cab appeal to be bits and pieces of his psyche. This is brought out when one woman who prattles on about philosophy (some key metaphor points) and claims she is his ""Chief of Theory.""

When the character is monotone and cryptic, he doesnt have to be boring, but he is here because he's MEANINGLESS. He's meaningless when nothing he says connects to our deeper understanding of his humanity - perhaps being reflected from some dark caverns of emotional connectivity. There are utterances that have no connective tissue within consensually validated meanings. In short, we have words that make no sense, or which make  non-sense.Many lines are spoken without the viewer believing the actor has any concept of who this character is; who he was or why he was saying these things. He repeats lines from memory. Its like ""we've smoked a joint; now anything we utter is cool. I am David Cronenberg, and everything I poop is gold; the chemical aids I ingest help me know it's so.""FINALLY, Paul Giamatti arrives with a brilliant performance at the end.

I've seen quite a few of his films and ever since watching it, Spider was my absolute least favorite of his. In fact, I hated that film. Well, Cosmpolis has now easily taken its place. This movie is so pretentious, bloated and dismally boring, that I'm not exactly sure what attracted such big stars as Juliette Binoche and Paul Giammati to join in. I'm excluding Rob Pattinson because I'm sure he was quite honored(and thankful) to be starring in such a different film coming off his Twilight streak.  Anyway, the plot revolves around a billionaire (Pattinson) who wants to get a haircut, way across town (Manhattan). His personal bodyguard/security is against this idea and numerous times throughout the film tries to veer him away from his haircut idea. Almost the entire movie takes place in his white stretch limo. Inside, he meets throughout the day with various people, some for business, some for pleasure. Oh yes, he even gets a prostrate exam(which he apparently does every day) in the limo by a doctor. At breakfast time and lunch he meets up with his wife, who is even more emotionally barren than he is. There is zero indication of what attracted these two to begin with. Aside from wealth (and their dead eyes), they seem to have nothing in common. Clearly, his character is a sociopath, a cheater and emotionally whacked. But none of these facts make the film any more interesting. In fact, I can't even count the times I nearly fell asleep. Too much talk, most of it seemingly random and not making much sense.

If you like seeing sex scenes in limos,including a doctor giving Pattinson a rectal for checkinghis prostate, go for it - but none of these scenes havenothing to do with the film story line, because, frankly,the the story line loses itself in realities.We gave this film the lowest rating ever in our history - zero.Note:  if you consider yourself ""extremely"" intelligent, and sawthis film, and gave it more than one star - it was solely for tryingto justify yourself to a film that is closest to the lowest commondenominator.

1590299,A1QIL7847ET6HX,B009AMABH6,xxgrendelxx,"[4, 12]","I laughed most of the way through ""COSMOPOLIS"" the way one does through most of Cronenberg's films - nervous, excited, horrified and shocked laughter - but I never laughed as hard as  when I realised that a majority of the people that will see this film are only fans of Pattinson for ""TWILIGHT"", his looks and tabloid drama. The jokes on them!To be a fan of Cronenberg means to be more than a little sadistic in your tastes, and he hasn't done a film like this since ""CRASH"", now out of print sadly. Viewers who only know his work from ""THE FLY"" or ""HISTORY OF VIOLENCE"" will expect to find a nice comfortable weird little niche and enjoy it without trying too hard on their part. Similarly, viewers of Coen Brothers films became way too comfortable with ""BIG LEBOWSKI"" and ""O BROTHER WHERE ARE THOU?"" and were therefore shocked at the violent excesses and seriousness of ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" which is the other thing they do so well after comedy. In short, if you went into a Cronenberg film and weren't expecting to have your mind flicked, you're in the wrong theater - it's your fault if you didn't like it.""I have an asymmetrical prostate..""The film is only just barely an allegory for the contemporary relationship between the neo-wealthy and the heralded ""99%"". It is also a singular story of one type of dissociated individual and how he perceives his place in the world. Walk-on characters provide musings enough for several thesis about the information age, time, fiscal uncertainty, and the relationship of the world's brightest and most creative minds to these. ""Packer""'s New York City is much like our own but retains that subtle Cronenberg split - a combination of romanticism and depravity. By the film's conclusion we are exposed to our own expectations laid bare of the neo-wealthy. It is sufficiently true, I believe, to cover the majority of people who either have nothing or have lost what little they began with.Reading the negative Amazon reviews is quite amusing. It indicates that the people who didn't like the film were expecting Pattinson doing what they expect him to do, more ""TWILIGHT"" chick-flick kind of work. The rest simply didn't have the patience or experience to watch a film that was much above, say - ""TRANSFORMERS"".But it's good that people not otherwise exposed to avant-garde or weird cinema are having their faces mashed in it. I recall how many people watched  Darren Aronofsky's ""BLACK SWAN"" because it was sweet little teetotaling Natalie Portman in a ballet movie... and people like me, familiar with Aronofsky, just laaaughed and laaaaaaaughed.*******************************************************************************************""LONG LIVE THE NEW FLESH!""Folks who reviewed 'Cosmopolis' and decided the characters weren't realistic enough to identify with, well - yeah, that's what Cronenberg does: he presents you with people whose motivations are utterly beyond anything you'd ever conceive of. This is the heart of his portrayal of horror. While the majority of us spend our lives trying to determine and come to grips with WHAT people think, the actual horror lies in that we may never know HOW they think. In the real world human synapses fire one way most of the time, time enough to mold what we consider reality or ""the way people are"" - in David's movies they fire altogether differently more often. People get turned on by car wrecks, they allow themselves to undergo surgery that creates gaming-sphincters at the base of their spine, they take violent ideological stands on issues that aren't even on the radar of the worlds they inhabit much less our own.I mean, what do you make of someone who takes pleasure in their steel prosthesis as the characters do in ""CRASH""? Or who believe sincerely that the television screen is the retina of the minds eye as in ""VIDEODROME""? These ""people"" have motivations so far out of the reach of what we think of as ""normal"", or even ""standard abnormal"", dare I say - even that of ""evil"" people.And Cronenberg, in the behind the scenes footage presented on this dvd, acknowledges this when he encourages his cast and crew to ponder what the motivations and thought processes are in the characters. Building the unreal is what he does as a filmmaker. Making it function and thrive in a world much like our own for two hours at a clip on film is his career. He's brilliant at it, too.We observe these fictional people and shake our heads in horror and shock, but there is something about a Cronenberg film that gets under one's skin. It isn't just the direct attempts at horror and the violence - that's been done to death, literally. It has something to do with the portrayal of a fictional depravity that mirrors the depravity in our own world but is not quite the same. You'll notice that never does a Cronenberg character abuse an innocent: never a child for instance, or helpless hapless female. All his secondary characters place themselves in harms way, many even delight in it. This has the effect of dissociating his audience from what they are witnessing - we are never outraged that a character is killed as we'd be in another director's film. These people are too weird to feel that strongly for them - but we are secretly thrilled and horrified. Voyeurism by the audience plays a major role in David's films and this makes the audience partly complicit in the film's action which is also why a Cronenberg film has the effect of creeping us out more than any other.Most people who die or are abused in the real world are truly victims. In David's world, they meet their demise half way and sometimes even pay for the privilege. Self-destruction is beyond doubt a wellspring of horror for Cronenberg.An American director could never achieve this, try as they might. Everything in the American spirit is based on a certain degree of venality, that and a need to affect another somehow - to be acknowledged by the other whether by violence or seduction or kindness, Americans love to draw attention to themselves and demand their film heroes do the same.David's Canadian sensibility is much more self absorbed and masturbatory. It has little interest in drawing attention to itself, which is one of the reasons Pattinson's portrayal works so well cooped up in his limousine, receiving prostate checks. David's protagonists are wrapped up in themselves in such a way that precludes judgement, by either audience or supporting fellows. They ARE. Nothing you think or say will affect their decisions, though those cinematic decisions were copied to paper months earlier by screenwriters. An act of depravity or violence by a Cronenberg protagonist is not a provocation to the audience - it is a statement, and this is why David's films leave some viewers reflecting on what they've seen and others simply insulted. He doesn't ask for your opinion... or permission.You entered the theater. Buy the ticket, take the ride.American protagonists always seem to be written in such a manner that invites criticism or agreement, and that provokes dialogue between those who identify with the character and those who don't but at least recognise them. Despite the oft-repeated platitude that David's films provoke thought (""... a thinking man's movie"") I find that what they really do is provoke a visceral response. Even his critics cannot deny that they couldn't find anything they could put into words as the reasons for their dislike (""I didn't like this movie - it was just DUMB..."") they just hated his movie. On the other side of the coin are those whose cerebrum is tickled by his concepts but ultimately thrilled and horrified by his presentation. Neither reaction can be described in terms of conscious approval or dispapproval - the response comes from the gut.""Destroy all rational thought"".No, in the end Cronenberg's films more often provoke disgust than deliberation... and this makes them, as William Burroughs might say ""like a tainted cheese"" -  deliciously horrible.",5,"""I understand none of this...""",1358035200,"01 13,
