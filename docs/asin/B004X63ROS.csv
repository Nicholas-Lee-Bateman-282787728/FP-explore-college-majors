1431456,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B004X63ROS,Chip Kaufmann,"[1, 1]","Along with QUEEN OF BLOOD (also reviewed by me on amazon), BLOOD BATH is a remarkable achievement in hybrid cinema. The fact that they were intended to be seen together as a double bill makes for a fascinating study of contrasts as QUEEN is in vivid color and BLOOD BATH is in stark black & white. Never has a movie had a more convoluted history than this film which began life as a Yugoslavian film called OPERATION TITIAN. After purchasing it Roger Corman turned it over to Jack Hill who turned it into the story of a mad painter (William Campbell) who paints women in the throes of death and then covers their bodies in wax. This is intercut with humorous statements on the nature of art using hipsters in scenes very reminiscent of Corman's 1959 cult classic BUCKET OF BLOOD.However Corman was not satisfied with Jack Hill's embellishments so he hired young up and coming director Stephanie Rothman to embellish it further. This she did by incorporating a story about the artist also turning into a vampire (who looks nothing like him). Mix that in with the beatniks, the mad artist and the Yugoslavian footage and all in 62 minutes and you have one wild, bizarre movie experience that manages to hang together into a fascinating whole. It doesn't make a lot of sense but then it doesn't have to. Later the original film was expanded to 80 minutes with more leftover footage and turned into the TV movie TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE. The original Yugoslavian footage was reedited by a young Francis Ford Coppola as the TV movie PORTRAIT IN TERROR.Now for the first time since its drive-in run it's possible to see BLOOD BATH the way it was in the theaters. We're back to the original 62 minute print with the original widescreen aspect radio restored. What really makes the movie is the astonishing black & white photography which is beautifully highlighted in this MGM Limited Edition DVD-R. Ronald Stein's creepy score and the startling paintings (which would influence NIGHT GALLERY) make for a genuinely disturbing film. This is what creative, low budget cinema is all about and its great to have BLOOD BATH and its companion piece QUEEN OF BLOOD looking even better than they did when they were first released. Try and see them both if you can but only in the MGM Limited Edition versions.",4,A Patchwork Quilt Cinema Classic,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,2290,"['QUEEN', 'OF', 'BLOOD', 'also', 'reviewed', 'amazon', 'BLOOD', 'BATH', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'hybrid', 'cinema', 'fact', 'were', 'intended', 'be', 'seen', 'together', 'double', 'bill', 'fascinating', 'study', 'contrasts', 'QUEEN', 'vivid', 'color', 'BLOOD', 'BATH', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'Never', 'movie', 'had', 'more', 'convoluted', 'history', 'film', 'began', 'life', 'Yugoslavian', 'film', 'called', 'OPERATION', 'TITIAN', 'purchasing', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'turned', 'Jack', 'Hill', 'who', 'turned', 'story', 'mad', 'painter', 'William', 'Campbell', 'who', 'women', 'throes', 'death', 'then', 'bodies', 'wax', 'intercut', 'humorous', 'statements', 'nature', 'art', 'using', 'hipsters', 'scenes', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Corman', '1959', 'cult', 'classic', 'BUCKET', 'OF', 'BLOOD.However', 'Corman', 'was', 'not', 'satisfied', 'Jack', 'Hill', 'embellishments', 'hired', 'young', 'up', 'coming', 'director', 'Stephanie', 'Rothman', 'embellish', 'further', 'did', 'incorporating', 'story', 'artist', 'also', 'turning', 'vampire', 'who', 'nothing', 'Mix', 'beatniks', 'mad', 'artist', 'Yugoslavian', 'footage', '62', 'minutes', 'have', 'one', 'wild', 'bizarre', 'movie', 'experience', 'hang', 'together', 'fascinating', 'whole', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'then', ""n't"", 'have', 'Later', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'expanded', '80', 'minutes', 'more', 'leftover', 'footage', 'turned', 'TV', 'movie', 'TRACK', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'original', 'Yugoslavian', 'footage', 'was', 'reedited', 'young', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'TV', 'movie', 'PORTRAIT', 'IN', 'TERROR.Now', 'first', 'time', 'drive-in', 'run', 'possible', 'see', 'BLOOD', 'BATH', 'way', 'was', 'theaters', ""'re"", 'back', 'original', '62', 'minute', 'print', 'original', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'radio', 'restored', 'What', 'really', 'movie', 'astonishing', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'beautifully', 'highlighted', 'MGM', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'DVD-R.', 'Ronald', 'Stein', 'creepy', 'score', 'startling', 'paintings', 'would', 'influence', 'NIGHT', 'GALLERY', 'make', 'genuinely', 'disturbing', 'film', 'creative', 'low', 'budget', 'cinema', 'about', 'great', 'have', 'BLOOD', 'BATH', 'companion', 'piece', 'QUEEN', 'OF', 'BLOOD', 'looking', 'even', 'better', 'did', 'when', 'were', 'first', 'released', 'Try', 'see', 'can', 'only', 'MGM', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'versions']",Blood Bath
1431457,AO8VEOP2V3R8Y,B004X63ROS,"Doctor Mabuse ""Evil Genius, King of Crime""","[4, 4]","The remarkable low-budget horror film BLOOD BATH is an esoteric example of accidental art whose production history is as interesting as the film itself.Uncredited Executive Producer Roger Corman hired co-director Stephanie Rothman (THE VELVET VAMPIRE) to complete an unfinished and shelved independent thriller directed by Jack Hill (SPIDER BABY), about a killer artist stalking the Beat art scene in Venice, California. Rothman's re-write transformed the villain into a vampire.Corman embellished BLOOD BATH with ten minutes of rich atmospheric footage from a Yugoslavian film, OPERATION TITIAN, which in turn was revised by Corman protege Francis Ford Coppola as a very obscure feature released exclusively to television, PORTRAIT OF TERROR. This combined the dubbed and re-edited TITIAN with new scenes featuring actors William Campbell (STAR TREK) and Patrick Magee (A CLOCKWORK ORANGE), shot by second-unit director Hill during the filming in Ireland of Coppola's first commercial feature, DEMENTIA 13.In BLOOD BATH, William Campbell's character retained the same occupation and name (artist ""Antonio Sordi"", or ""Tony"") from PORTRAIT. An early cut of the film contained even more footage from TITIAN which was trimmed for the finished theatrical edition released by American-International Productions.For the television version of BLOOD BATH entitled TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE, Corman and Rothman expanded the 62-minute theatrical cut by eleven minutes, restoring some of the Yugoslavian footage and adding out-takes from the American version (including a three-minute interpretive ballet on the beach by Lori/Linda Saunders).The most notable addition to TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE was a scene of Campbell and Magee from PORTRAIT OF TERROR, newly-dubbed to fit the existing story. The scene established a sub-plot which altered one of the supporting characters. (It also served as preparation for the nonsensical presence of Magee's ""corpse"" in the finale.)These additions and restorations emphasized the patchwork nature of the film but also enhanced the unique sense of a bizarre collage.The main debit is the jarring inclusion of awful improvisational black-comedy scenes, set in a Beat coffee-house, which look and play like out-takes from Corman's BUCKET OF BLOOD. These do, however, slyly satirize the very randomness of the film itself, enlightening us as to the ""cosmic"" effect of quantum physics on pretentious modern art. (The scenes were deleted from the TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE cut.)The film's strongest assets are its beautiful black-and-white photography (by Alfred Taylor and Nenad Jovicic) and an eerie score by Ronald Stein. It benefits from a deeply creepy performance by Campbell, a striking one by Sandra Knight (of FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER and Corman's THE TERROR), and the bikinied presence of breathtaking Saunders.In either of its variants, BLOOD BATH is a tremendously weird and compelling film that makes no sense at all on a story level but chances to succeed as low-budget surrealism worthy of Mario Bava. A dream scene effectively suggests the designs of Salvadore Dali; while a nightmarish sequence (shot with style by Rothman) of Knight tracking the vampire on shadowed streets approaches the haunting beauty of Herk Harvey's CARNIVAL OF SOULS.The MGM Limited Edition made-to-order DVD-R is the original 62-min. theatrical version of BLOOD BATH, presented in its correct aspect ratio and rarely seen since its original release. This is a good print which looks and sounds dramatically better any any of the public-domain DVD's of the TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE version. Adjust monitor's sharpness control to minimum for intermittent excess grain.RATING: 7/10 *** GOOD.",4,Quantum Art,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,3683,"['remarkable', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'film', 'BLOOD', 'BATH', 'esoteric', 'example', 'accidental', 'art', 'production', 'history', 'as', 'interesting', 'film', 'itself.Uncredited', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'hired', 'co-director', 'Stephanie', 'Rothman', 'THE', 'VELVET', 'VAMPIRE', 'complete', 'unfinished', 'shelved', 'independent', 'thriller', 'directed', 'Jack', 'Hill', 'SPIDER', 'BABY', 'killer', 'artist', 'stalking', 'Beat', 'art', 'scene', 'Venice', 'California', 'Rothman', 're-write', 'transformed', 'villain', 'vampire.Corman', 'embellished', 'BLOOD', 'BATH', 'ten', 'minutes', 'rich', 'atmospheric', 'footage', 'Yugoslavian', 'film', 'OPERATION', 'TITIAN', 'turn', 'was', 'revised', 'Corman', 'protege', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'very', 'obscure', 'feature', 'released', 'exclusively', 'television', 'PORTRAIT', 'OF', 'TERROR', 'combined', 'dubbed', 're-edited', 'TITIAN', 'new', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'actors', 'William', 'Campbell', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'Patrick', 'Magee', 'A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'shot', 'second-unit', 'director', 'Hill', 'filming', 'Ireland', 'Coppola', 'first', 'commercial', 'feature', 'DEMENTIA', '13.In', 'BLOOD', 'BATH', 'William', 'Campbell', 'character', 'retained', 'same', 'occupation', 'name', 'artist', 'Antonio', 'Sordi', 'Tony', 'PORTRAIT', 'early', 'cut', 'film', 'contained', 'even', 'more', 'footage', 'TITIAN', 'was', 'trimmed', 'finished', 'theatrical', 'edition', 'released', 'American-International', 'Productions.For', 'television', 'version', 'BLOOD', 'BATH', 'entitled', 'TRACK', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'Corman', 'Rothman', 'expanded', '62-minute', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'eleven', 'minutes', 'restoring', 'Yugoslavian', 'footage', 'adding', 'out-takes', 'American', 'version', 'including', 'three-minute', 'interpretive', 'ballet', 'beach', 'Lori/Linda', 'Saunders', 'most', 'notable', 'addition', 'TRACK', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'was', 'scene', 'Campbell', 'Magee', 'PORTRAIT', 'OF', 'TERROR', 'newly-dubbed', 'fit', 'existing', 'story', 'scene', 'established', 'sub-plot', 'altered', 'one', 'supporting', 'characters', 'also', 'served', 'preparation', 'nonsensical', 'presence', 'Magee', 'corpse', 'finale', 'additions', 'restorations', 'emphasized', 'patchwork', 'nature', 'film', 'also', 'enhanced', 'unique', 'sense', 'bizarre', 'collage.The', 'main', 'debit', 'jarring', 'inclusion', 'awful', 'improvisational', 'black-comedy', 'scenes', 'set', 'Beat', 'coffee-house', 'look', 'play', 'out-takes', 'Corman', 'BUCKET', 'OF', 'BLOOD', 'do', 'however', 'slyly', 'satirize', 'very', 'randomness', 'film', 'enlightening', 'cosmic', 'effect', 'quantum', 'physics', 'pretentious', 'modern', 'art', 'scenes', 'were', 'deleted', 'TRACK', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'cut', 'film', 'strongest', 'assets', 'are', 'beautiful', 'black-and-white', 'photography', 'Alfred', 'Taylor', 'Nenad', 'Jovicic', 'eerie', 'score', 'Ronald', 'Stein', 'benefits', 'deeply', 'creepy', 'performance', 'Campbell', 'striking', 'one', 'Sandra', 'Knight', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'DAUGHTER', 'Corman', 'THE', 'TERROR', 'bikinied', 'presence', 'breathtaking', 'Saunders.In', 'variants', 'BLOOD', 'BATH', 'tremendously', 'weird', 'compelling', 'film', 'sense', 'story', 'level', 'chances', 'succeed', 'low-budget', 'surrealism', 'worthy', 'Mario', 'Bava', 'A', 'dream', 'scene', 'effectively', 'designs', 'Salvadore', 'Dali', 'nightmarish', 'sequence', 'shot', 'style', 'Rothman', 'Knight', 'tracking', 'vampire', 'shadowed', 'streets', 'haunting', 'beauty', 'Herk', 'Harvey', 'CARNIVAL', 'OF', 'SOULS.The', 'MGM', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'made-to-order', 'DVD-R', 'original', '62-min', 'theatrical', 'version', 'BLOOD', 'BATH', 'presented', 'correct', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'rarely', 'seen', 'original', 'release', 'good', 'print', 'dramatically', 'better', 'public-domain', 'DVD', 'TRACK', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'version', 'Adjust', 'monitor', 'sharpness', 'control', 'minimum', 'intermittent', 'excess', 'grain.RATING', '7/10', '***', 'GOOD']",Blood Bath

Part of that is due to the actors giving some intense performances, but the lion's share of the credit goes to the nighttime black-and-white photography. It's not quite as stylized as typical noir or horror, but the darker scenes have an interesting edge to them, and even the scenes in daylight have an ""off"" quality. The idea of somehow capturing life or death on canvas is a good one. Sure Oscar Wilde did it with Dorian Gray, and it's been done in other pics as well, but the whole ""Dead Red Nudes"" concept is a solidly weird one. But the fact that the film throws in a bizarre vampire subplot to this already over-saturated tale just shows how off the rails an hour-long film can get.""",3,An unholy mess of a film,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,884,"['Judge', 'Gordon', 'Sullivan', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'multiple', 'directors', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'determine', 'who', 'responsible', 'what', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'Blood', 'Bath', 'impressively', 'creepy', 'Part', 'due', 'actors', 'giving', 'intense', 'performances', 'lion', 'share', 'credit', 'nighttime', 'black-and-white', 'photography', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'stylized', 'typical', 'noir', 'horror', 'darker', 'scenes', 'have', 'interesting', 'edge', 'even', 'scenes', 'daylight', 'have', 'off', 'quality', 'idea', 'somehow', 'capturing', 'life', 'death', 'canvas', 'good', 'one', 'Sure', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'did', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'been', 'done', 'other', 'pics', 'well', 'whole', 'Dead', 'Red', 'Nudes', 'concept', 'solidly', 'weird', 'one', 'fact', 'film', 'bizarre', 'vampire', 'subplot', 'already', 'over-saturated', 'tale', 'just', 'how', 'off', 'rails', 'hour-long', 'film', 'can', 'get']",Blood Bath
1431459,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B004X63ROS,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","What a weird little flick. This 62 minute quickie, directed by Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman, is about as odd an entry as I've seen in this type of movie. It's set in Venice CA. though much of the architecture seems European. It involves an artist who is the descendant of another, centuries earlier, artist who was put to death for witchcraft, though somehow it caused him to turn into a vampire. He now paints women in the throes of death, kills them and dips them in acid.I understand this was culled from other movies which explains having two directors and why the villain has two separate visages. But those other movies must have been pretty bad as they still only ended up with a 62 minute flick. The black and white cinematography, particularly in the night scenes, is stunning. And the story contains some odd notes. How many movies have you seen that try to fuse art with quantum physics? And one of the scenes is set up as though it were one of Salvidor Dali's paintings. It's a real eye opener. There is some fun jabbing at the sensibilities of artists and some pretty good cheese cake in the form of Lori Saunders in a bikini.It's cool seeing Sid Haig in his early days but, like much of the rest of the movie, it's just a curiosity. The whole thing doesn't quite hang together. Plus, the villain resides in a church tower his ancestor resided in in the 11th century. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe there was a United States in the 11th century. Still, though, this is a lot of fun and it's short enough and whacked enough to warrant the attention of ardent film fans.",3,Artsy Horror,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,1603,"['What', 'weird', 'little', 'flick', '62', 'minute', 'quickie', 'directed', 'Jack', 'Hill', 'Stephanie', 'Rothman', 'odd', 'entry', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'type', 'movie', 'set', 'Venice', 'CA', 'much', 'architecture', 'European', 'artist', 'who', 'descendant', 'centuries', 'earlier', 'artist', 'who', 'was', 'put', 'death', 'witchcraft', 'somehow', 'caused', 'turn', 'vampire', 'now', 'women', 'throes', 'death', 'dips', 'acid.I', 'understand', 'was', 'culled', 'other', 'movies', 'having', 'two', 'directors', 'why', 'villain', 'two', 'separate', 'visages', 'other', 'movies', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'bad', 'still', 'only', 'ended', 'up', '62', 'minute', 'flick', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'particularly', 'night', 'scenes', 'stunning', 'story', 'odd', 'notes', 'How', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'try', 'fuse', 'art', 'quantum', 'physics', 'one', 'scenes', 'set', 'up', 'were', 'one', 'Salvidor', 'Dali', 'paintings', 'real', 'eye', 'opener', 'fun', 'jabbing', 'sensibilities', 'artists', 'pretty', 'good', 'cheese', 'cake', 'form', 'Lori', 'Saunders', 'bikini.It', 'cool', 'seeing', 'Sid', 'Haig', 'early', 'days', 'much', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'curiosity', 'whole', 'thing', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hang', 'together', 'villain', 'resides', 'church', 'tower', 'ancestor', 'resided', '11th', 'century', 'Now', 'correct', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'United', 'States', '11th', 'century', 'Still', 'though', 'lot', 'fun', 'short', 'enough', 'whacked', 'enough', 'warrant', 'attention', 'ardent', 'film', 'fans']",Blood Bath
1431460,A2EENVGNDH8N9G,B004X63ROS,Mike,"[2, 2]","It was another cold mostly dreary winter day so I decided to watch two Prime video movies.  I'm really getting my money's worth out of my membership.  Today I went with off-beat Vampire stories.  Yes, I look for the unusual stories. The first was `Blood Bath' from 1966. Watching it I thought for sure it was Italian made.  Later I read up on it, turns out it was filmed in Serbia, of all places, and L.A.  It starred William Campbell.  I knew him best as Trelane in the original series Star Trek episode `The Squire of Gothos' and as a Klingon in another episode.  The story is about a Jekyll and Hyde like vampire.  At times he seems like a gentle but rather morbid artist. Other times he is possessed by a vampire artist ancestor of his.  The back story for his vampire ancestor was a bit confusing.  Nowadays he finds female victims and boils their bodies for some reason.  He boils them till they look like soap sculptures.  He also makes morbid death paintings of female nudes.  As in many films of this type there seems to be an endless supply of naive women victims for him to choose from.  Sometimes they're standing under gothic arches on dark streets late at night. Evidently they're waiting to become victims.  No they aren't there because they're hookers or anything close to logical like that.  Other times they`re swimming alone in bikinis on isolated beaches or hanging out alone by swimming pools at night. One female, after meeting him on the street admiring his art work in a window, is lured to his studio.  She then offers to do some modeling for him and strips without even being asked to.  Yes, even though his studio looks like it's in the Tower of London only not as cheery, the women don't seem overly concerned about the decor.  There are some attempts at surreal scenes in the movie where the director is trying to be artistic, the carousel scene for instance.  A woman is being chased on this carousel by the vampire, she begs for help yet either nobody takes her pleas seriously or they just don't care.  The best part about the film for me was the comments it contained on the nature of art and its value.  To me much of what is now considered priceless art is simply garbage in disguise; some of Andy Warhol's works come to mind as examples of expensive junk.  Is a painting  of a Campbell's soup can really worth a fortune? This movie seems to agree with me that it's not. There are some beatnik-like characters in it that think all kinds of junk are art.  One character even has what appears to be a prototype of our current paint ball guns and uses it to enhance his ""art"".  There are some very unlikely heroes that turn up. The film does succeed to some extent by being different and ends with pretty good scares even if the makeup is poor. For those reasons and its offbeat quality I give it a 2 out of 5 rating.  It was diverting.",2,One man's art is another man's chamber of horrors,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,2868,"['was', 'cold', 'mostly', 'dreary', 'winter', 'day', 'decided', 'watch', 'two', 'Prime', 'video', 'movies', ""'m"", 'really', 'getting', 'money', 'worth', 'membership', 'Today', 'went', 'off-beat', 'Vampire', 'stories', 'Yes', 'look', 'unusual', 'stories', 'first', 'was', 'Blood', 'Bath', '1966', 'Watching', 'thought', 'sure', 'was', 'Italian', 'made', 'Later', 'read', 'up', 'out', 'was', 'filmed', 'Serbia', 'places', 'L.A', 'starred', 'William', 'Campbell', 'knew', 'best', 'Trelane', 'original', 'series', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'Squire', 'Gothos', 'Klingon', 'episode', 'story', 'Jekyll', 'Hyde', 'vampire', 'times', 'gentle', 'rather', 'morbid', 'artist', 'Other', 'times', 'possessed', 'vampire', 'artist', 'ancestor', 'back', 'story', 'vampire', 'ancestor', 'was', 'bit', 'confusing', 'female', 'victims', 'boils', 'bodies', 'reason', 'look', 'soap', 'sculptures', 'also', 'morbid', 'death', 'paintings', 'female', 'nudes', 'many', 'films', 'type', 'there', 'be', 'endless', 'supply', 'naive', 'women', 'victims', 'choose', 'Sometimes', ""'re"", 'standing', 'gothic', 'arches', 'dark', 'streets', 'late', 'night', 'Evidently', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'become', 'victims', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', ""'re"", 'hookers', 'anything', 'close', 'logical', 'Other', 'times', 're', 'swimming', 'alone', 'bikinis', 'isolated', 'beaches', 'hanging', 'out', 'alone', 'swimming', 'pools', 'night', 'One', 'female', 'meeting', 'street', 'admiring', 'art', 'work', 'window', 'lured', 'studio', 'then', 'do', 'modeling', 'strips', 'even', 'being', 'asked', 'Yes', 'even', 'studio', 'Tower', 'London', 'only', 'not', 'cheery', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'overly', 'concerned', 'decor', 'are', 'attempts', 'surreal', 'scenes', 'movie', 'where', 'director', 'trying', 'be', 'artistic', 'carousel', 'scene', 'instance', 'woman', 'being', 'chased', 'carousel', 'vampire', 'help', 'yet', 'nobody', 'pleas', 'seriously', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'comments', 'contained', 'nature', 'art', 'value', 'much', 'what', 'now', 'considered', 'priceless', 'art', 'simply', 'garbage', 'disguise', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'works', 'come', 'mind', 'examples', 'expensive', 'junk', 'painting', 'Campbell', 'soup', 'can', 'really', 'worth', 'fortune', 'movie', 'agree', 'not', 'are', 'beatnik-like', 'characters', 'think', 'kinds', 'junk', 'are', 'art', 'One', 'character', 'even', 'what', 'be', 'prototype', 'current', 'paint', 'ball', 'guns', 'enhance', 'art', 'are', 'very', 'unlikely', 'heroes', 'turn', 'up', 'film', 'succeed', 'extent', 'being', 'different', 'pretty', 'good', 'scares', 'even', 'makeup', 'poor', 'reasons', 'offbeat', 'quality', 'give', '2', '5', 'rating', 'was', 'diverting']",Blood Bath
