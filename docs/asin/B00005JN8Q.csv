There are some fantastic, unique gems mingled throughout the series. I have yet to see a bad episode.From Spielberg to Scorsese, many of the most powerful directors of our generation have contributed their guidance at the helm of many stories. My personal favorite would be hard to choose. Perhaps, ""A few more Dreamers"" starring Mark Hamill from Star Wars. Or maybe the Pilot episode directed by Spielberg starring Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Costner. Amazing Stories is a series which beams with originality, with a wink towards the impossible.Hopefully, if our voices are heard, they will release (as they did with Shelly Duvall's Fiary Tale Theater) the entire saga in one release, rather than spanning it out over time. My biggest hope would be that it will be released before I have children; what could be a better gift to pass down than an incredible stir of the imagination??(Good resources for dvd releases, which would most likely be first to report would be thedigitalbits.com or videoeta.com) ~SAOS~____11.23.06Just to let you know, I now own this set. Its great to have. The quality is fantastic, and the familiar and new stories bring me into the nastalgia factory. Terrific. Thanks for releasing them!!

627747,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JN8Q,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[133, 146]","There are some things that are just special. Special things or moments that are benchmarks for a certain period in your life. Well, this show was one of them for me. Along with the likes of ""The Goonies"", ""Stand By Me"", and any John Hughes film of the 80's, this show was one of those treasures from my childhood that makes me look back fondly on it with such great nostalgia. I loved this show. I watched it regularly, and was always looking forward to seeing what strange trip Spielberg and crew were going to take us on this week. Of course, at this time Spielberg could do no wrong, so it was obvious to me that I was going to be right there for this show. I had already seen ""E.T."" and I had gone to the theaters with my dad to see ""Temple Of Doom"" 11 times. Spielberg wanted a show every week that he had described to the network would be like campfire tales. It's too bad that in it's time, the show was never really appreciated for what it was. It was not a big hit, but Spielberg was already promised a two season pick up. I have no idea why the show was not regarded very highly by people back then, and it still seems to fight for respect and recognition today. It doesn't make sense to me. Anyways, this was a wonderful and fantastic show that delivered the goods every week. Sure, not all of the episdoes were huge winners, but they never disappointed in creativity and were always fun to watch. So, what does season one have to deliver?. The premiere episode, ""Ghost Train"", is a pretty good one, but the first real classic of season one is the episode, ""Mummy, Daddy"". This is one of many that I always remember. It's about an actor named Harold who is playing a mummy in a movie. He goes to his wife who is going into labor, and doesn't know that a real mummy has come to life. Classic episode. Then there is ""The Mission"". Starring Kevin Costner, this has to be one of the most remembered episodes. A world wat II crew's belly gunner is stuck in his seat in the bottom of the plane and it appears that he will be crushed upon landing...until a miracle happens. A brilliant and magical episode. ""Fine Tuning"" is kind of a silly, but fun, episode about a teen who picks up an outer space signal that aliens are coming, and the aliens come to Hollywood and want to take people back with them. ""Mr. Magic"" has the great Sid Caesar playing an aging and fading magician who gets a new shot at his career with the help of a magical deck of cards. ""Remote Control Man"" is another favorite of mine. A harried man with a horrible family life is able to bring TV images to life. One episode that will always be cherished by moi is ""Santa '85"", a charming ep about a boy who helps Santa after he's jailed while delivering presents. Another top ep I remember quite fondly. Shot in black and white, ""No Day At The Beach"" finds a put upon GI try to save the lives of his comrades in World War II. Charlie Sheen appears in this one. John Lithgow stars in ""The Doll"", a finely written piece about a man's obsession with a doll he got for his niece. These eps are the best of the bunch. Not that the others are bad. The show got top notch talent behind the scenes with people like Richard Matheson, Martin Scorsesse, Paul Bartel, Joe Dante, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Bob Balaban, Mick Garris, and of course, Steve Spielberg. The first season also had an array of great guest stars like Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Costner, Gregory Hines, Milton Berle, Charles Durning, Sid Caesar, Charles Nelson Reilly, Harvey Keitel, Beau Bridges, Seth Green, James Cromwell, Joe Pantoliano, Forest Whitaker, Sam Waterston, Tim Robbins, Eve Arden, Griffin Dunne, and others. The show was amazing shot and filmed, and even when the stories went to the extremely goofy and silly, I think it was meant to be that way. Some were quite cheesy and hammy, but I believe that it was the show's intent to be kind of slapsticky in the old school ways. Hopefully, the show will finally get the respect it deserves. It is a fine, fine show that was wonderfully designed and brings back so many fond memories. Who knows what more Spielberg could of given us if the show had continued. Seasn two contained more of my absolute favorites, and I hope that DVD is soon on it's way. Do yourself a favor and get this DVD to rediscover the magic of this wonderful show.",5,Open Your Imagination,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,4334,"['are', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'special', 'Special', 'things', 'moments', 'are', 'benchmarks', 'certain', 'period', 'life', 'Well', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'likes', 'Goonies', 'Stand', 'Me', 'John', 'Hughes', 'film', '80', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'treasures', 'childhood', 'look', 'back', 'fondly', 'such', 'great', 'nostalgia', 'loved', 'show', 'watched', 'regularly', 'was', 'always', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'strange', 'trip', 'Spielberg', 'crew', 'were', 'going', 'take', 'week', 'course', 'time', 'Spielberg', 'could', 'do', 'wrong', 'was', 'obvious', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'right', 'there', 'show', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'E.T', 'had', 'gone', 'theaters', 'dad', 'see', 'Temple', 'Doom', '11', 'times', 'Spielberg', 'wanted', 'show', 'week', 'had', 'described', 'network', 'would', 'be', 'campfire', 'tales', 'too', 'bad', 'time', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'appreciated', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'hit', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'already', 'promised', 'two', 'season', 'pick', 'up', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'regarded', 'very', 'highly', 'people', 'back', 'then', 'still', 'fight', 'respect', 'recognition', 'today', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Anyways', 'was', 'wonderful', 'fantastic', 'show', 'delivered', 'goods', 'week', 'Sure', 'not', 'episdoes', 'were', 'huge', 'winners', 'never', 'disappointed', 'creativity', 'were', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'So', 'what', 'season', 'one', 'have', 'deliver', 'premiere', 'episode', 'Ghost', 'Train', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'first', 'real', 'classic', 'season', 'one', 'episode', 'Mummy', 'Daddy', 'one', 'many', 'always', 'remember', 'actor', 'named', 'Harold', 'who', 'playing', 'mummy', 'movie', 'wife', 'who', 'going', 'labor', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'mummy', 'come', 'life', 'Classic', 'episode', 'Then', 'Mission', 'Starring', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'remembered', 'episodes', 'world', 'wat', 'II', 'crew', 'belly', 'gunner', 'stuck', 'seat', 'bottom', 'plane', 'will', 'be', 'crushed', 'landing', 'miracle', 'brilliant', 'magical', 'episode', 'Fine', 'Tuning', 'kind', 'silly', 'fun', 'episode', 'teen', 'who', 'up', 'outer', 'space', 'signal', 'aliens', 'are', 'coming', 'aliens', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'want', 'take', 'people', 'back', 'Mr.', 'Magic', 'great', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'playing', 'aging', 'fading', 'magician', 'who', 'new', 'shot', 'career', 'help', 'magical', 'deck', 'cards', 'Remote', 'Control', 'Man', 'favorite', 'mine', 'harried', 'man', 'horrible', 'family', 'life', 'able', 'bring', 'TV', 'images', 'life', 'One', 'episode', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'cherished', 'moi', 'Santa', ""'85"", 'charming', 'ep', 'boy', 'who', 'Santa', 'jailed', 'delivering', 'presents', 'top', 'ep', 'remember', 'quite', 'fondly', 'Shot', 'black', 'white', 'Day', 'Beach', 'put', 'GI', 'try', 'save', 'lives', 'comrades', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'one', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Doll', 'finely', 'written', 'piece', 'man', 'obsession', 'doll', 'got', 'niece', 'eps', 'are', 'best', 'bunch', 'Not', 'others', 'are', 'bad', 'show', 'got', 'top', 'notch', 'talent', 'scenes', 'people', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Martin', 'Scorsesse', 'Paul', 'Bartel', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'course', 'Steve', 'Spielberg', 'first', 'season', 'also', 'had', 'array', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'Charles', 'Nelson', 'Reilly', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Seth', 'Green', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'Griffin', 'Dunne', 'others', 'show', 'was', 'amazing', 'shot', 'filmed', 'even', 'when', 'stories', 'went', 'extremely', 'goofy', 'silly', 'think', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'way', 'were', 'quite', 'cheesy', 'hammy', 'believe', 'was', 'show', 'intent', 'be', 'kind', 'slapsticky', 'old', 'school', 'ways', 'Hopefully', 'show', 'will', 'finally', 'get', 'respect', 'fine', 'fine', 'show', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'designed', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'fond', 'memories', 'Who', 'what', 'more', 'Spielberg', 'could', 'given', 'show', 'had', 'continued', 'Seasn', 'two', 'contained', 'more', 'absolute', 'favorites', 'hope', 'DVD', 'soon', 'way', 'Do', 'favor', 'get', 'DVD', 'rediscover', 'magic', 'wonderful', 'show']",Amazing Stories: The Complete First Season

627752,A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3,B00005JN8Q,Brian Reaves,"[3, 4]","In the 80's, Stephen Spielberg could almost do no wrong. He had a ton of hit movies under his belt, and decided it was time to try a project he'd been toying with for years. ""Amazing Stories"" was a show produced by Spielberg in which every episode was supposed to be a mini-movie. Indeed, most of these came from ideas he had or had read but couldn't fill out enough for a movie. Thus the world was treated to thirty-minute vignettes of sheer brilliance boasting a cast of well-known 80's icons like Charlie Sheen, Kevin Costner, Andrew McCarthy, John Lithgow, Dom DeLuise, and Kiefer Sutherland. The budget for a series like this today would be astronomical, so we'll probably never see the likes of it again.Like ""The Twilight Zone"" before it, each episode stood alone with a trip to the odd or surreal moments of life. Some were touching (like ""Vanessa in the Garden"" and ""Grandpa's Ghost""), some were funny (like ""Mummy, Daddy"" and ""The Main Attraction""), and some were just plain scary (like ""Mirror, Mirror"" and ""The Doll"")--but most were perfect.Collecting just the first season, this DVD set showcases 24 of the best episodes of the series. The production values on the episodes was amazing at the time, and as a result they really aren't as dated as you'd think. ""Remote Control Man"" is funny because you see cameos from some of TV's biggest stars at the time (Dirk Benedict of ""The A-Team"", Gary Coleman of ""Diff'rent Strokes"", Richard Simmons, and even Lou Ferrigno as the Incredible Hulk just to name a few) as a man's dream remote slowly turns his life from perfect television bliss to chaos.Other great episodes include ""Mummy, Daddy"" (my all-time favorite episode), in which an actor from a horror movie tries to get to the hospital where his wife is having a baby--while still in costume as a mummy. ""The Mission"" is a special hour long episode starring Kevin Costner and Kiefer Sutherland about a World War 2 bomber crew coming home from a brutal mission, and finding themselves forced to make a life-and-death decision for one of their own in the process. ""The Amazing Falsworth"" has Gregory Hines portraying a nightclub psychic who finds himself accidentally reading the mind of a murderer somewhere in his audience.The funny episodes are balanced out with serious ones, and that's what keeps the show from getting old. There are even moments of sheer terror in a few shows like ""Mirror, Mirror"" where a horror author sees a hooded figure trying to kill him in the mirrors.Are there duds in this set? I don't think so. And I hope they bring out the second (and final) season too because it had some great stories as well. Stars like Christopher Lloyd and Weird Al Yankovic got into the act in the second season, and of course the cartoon episode ""Family Dog"" (which later went on to become a short-lived series of its own) can't be forgotten.The set contains about 20 minutes of deleted scenes from various episodes, but that's all by way of extras. It's a shame since it would have been great to hear commentary by at least a few of the stars or directors on the shows, but at least it's something--which is more than can be said for a lot of other sets out there. While I can't say I'm thrilled with the packaging, I'm just glad to see this wonderful show finally come to DVD.",5,Spielberg's landmark series from the 80's comes to DVD,1153008000,"07 16, 2006",2006,3297,"['80', 'Stephen', 'Spielberg', 'could', 'almost', 'do', 'wrong', 'had', 'ton', 'hit', 'movies', 'belt', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'try', 'project', ""'d"", 'been', 'toying', 'years', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'was', 'show', 'produced', 'Spielberg', 'episode', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'mini-movie', 'Indeed', 'most', 'came', 'ideas', 'had', 'had', 'read', 'could', ""n't"", 'fill', 'out', 'enough', 'movie', 'Thus', 'world', 'was', 'treated', 'thirty-minute', 'vignettes', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'boasting', 'cast', 'well-known', '80', 'icons', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Dom', 'DeLuise', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'budget', 'series', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'astronomical', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'never', 'see', 'likes', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'stood', 'alone', 'trip', 'odd', 'surreal', 'moments', 'life', 'were', 'touching', 'Vanessa', 'Garden', 'Grandpa', 'Ghost', 'were', 'funny', 'Mummy', 'Daddy', 'Main', 'Attraction', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'scary', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'Doll', 'most', 'were', 'perfect.Collecting', 'just', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', '24', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'production', 'values', 'episodes', 'was', 'amazing', 'time', 'result', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'dated', ""'d"", 'think', 'Remote', 'Control', 'Man', 'funny', 'see', 'cameos', 'TV', 'biggest', 'stars', 'time', 'Dirk', 'Benedict', 'A-Team', 'Gary', 'Coleman', ""Diff'rent"", 'Strokes', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'even', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'man', 'dream', 'remote', 'slowly', 'life', 'perfect', 'television', 'bliss', 'chaos.Other', 'great', 'episodes', 'include', 'Mummy', 'Daddy', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'episode', 'actor', 'horror', 'movie', 'tries', 'get', 'hospital', 'where', 'wife', 'having', 'baby', 'still', 'costume', 'mummy', 'Mission', 'special', 'hour', 'long', 'episode', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'World', 'War', '2', 'bomber', 'crew', 'coming', 'home', 'brutal', 'mission', 'finding', 'forced', 'make', 'life-and-death', 'decision', 'one', 'own', 'process', 'Amazing', 'Falsworth', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'portraying', 'nightclub', 'psychic', 'who', 'accidentally', 'reading', 'mind', 'murderer', 'somewhere', 'audience.The', 'funny', 'episodes', 'are', 'balanced', 'out', 'serious', 'ones', 'what', 'show', 'getting', 'old', 'are', 'even', 'moments', 'sheer', 'terror', 'few', 'shows', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'where', 'horror', 'author', 'hooded', 'figure', 'trying', 'kill', 'mirrors.Are', 'there', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'hope', 'bring', 'out', 'second', 'final', 'season', 'too', 'had', 'great', 'stories', 'well', 'Stars', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Weird', 'Al', 'Yankovic', 'got', 'act', 'second', 'season', 'course', 'cartoon', 'episode', 'Family', 'Dog', 'later', 'went', 'become', 'short-lived', 'series', 'own', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'forgotten.The', 'set', 'contains', '20', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'various', 'episodes', 'way', 'extras', 'shame', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'hear', 'commentary', 'least', 'few', 'stars', 'directors', 'shows', 'least', 'something', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'lot', 'other', 'sets', 'out', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'packaging', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'see', 'wonderful', 'show', 'finally', 'come', 'DVD']",Amazing Stories: The Complete First Season

My favorites: were ""Fine Tuning,"""" ""The Doll,""  ""Santa `85"" and ""Mr. Magic."" Here are a few quick comments about those episodes:""Amazing"" is a good adjective for ""Fine Tuning,"" which is hilarious.....one of the funniest half- hour shows I've ever seen on ANY television program. .There are so many gags, both verbal and sight, that I lost count. People who know all the television references in here, from ""I Love Lucy,"" ""The Three Stooges,"" ""Burns and Allen"" to ""Ponderosa"" and at least a half dozen more, will get a lot more laughs than young people who are unfamiliar with shows. The same holds true for Milton Berle, who makes a guest appearance in here, with some funny lines. . Not only was this fantastically funny, but the ending was touching....a really nice finish that made you feel good.""The Doll"" was a change of pace....and one for the good; a wonderful story. Many viewers might find this a lot slower than the normal fare, but I really enjoyed and was touched by the sentiment. It's by far the best thing I've seen John Lithgow do. I'm not a fan of his but fair is fair, and he was absolutely terrific in this. He plays a meek, sad and lonely 42-year-old who finds love in the strangest of ways.""Santa '85"" was a nice sentimental story, even if it was predictable in the end. It was a good Christmas story and ran, of course, in the middle of December in 1985. It would have been a great show to air on Christmas Eve. Douglas Seale is excellent as Santa Claus, who winds up in jail on a ""breaking and entering"" charge! Pat Hingle plays the sheriff who arrests him and a man who desperately needs a little dose of Christmas spirit..On the whole, this story had a lot of charm to it, as well as humorSid Caesar was just great in ""Mr. Magic."". He plays ""Lou Bundles,"" a veteran magician, a guy who has performed at this same nightclub for 50 years! He's losing it, his talent and his mind but just before he's about to be fired, Lou takes a trip into an old magic shop and buys a deck of old playing cards..

Of course the adults think he is delusional until a train comes straight threw their house in the middle of the night and takes the old man on his way.Those kind of ""amazing"" stories helped Amazing Stories to gain a huge cult fan base. For years fans of the show have been awaiting for the series to arrive on DVD. Well Universal did a great job with the box set.

I loved AMAZING STORIES as a kid---I moderately like it as an adult.Most of these episodes have excellent concepts and original ideas. Some of them are even prophetic, especially ""Secret Cinema,"" which predates TRUMAN SHOW by a decade and foresees the popularity of reality TV. However, many of the episodes do not feel fully developed and end as soon as you start getting interested. Others are just plain BAD, in every department imaginable: writing, acting, pacing, effects, editing, EVERYTHING (""Fine Tuning,"" ""Hell Toupee"").The two biggest problems this series had were tone and audience. Specifically, was this series supposed to be scary? Funny? Mysterious? Cute and sweet? All of the above? And who was intended to watch it? Five-year-olds with ADHD? Geeky English grads? Lonely grandmothers? Again, all of the above? Consequently, this season, though many of the episodes are indispensable gems (""The Mission,"" ""The Doll""), feels, as a whole, a bit messy and indecisive.I feel I need to defend ""One for the Road"" and ""One for the Books,"" both of which many ""fans"" lambast.

627772,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JN8Q,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 13]","In the wake of his blockbuster films ""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" and ""E.T."", NBC got Steven Spielberg to create a television anthology series.  Spielberg's first directing gig was for one of the early episodes of Rod Serling's ""Night Gallery"" (the one with Joan Crawford as a blind woman), and of course the director was weaned on the classic anthology series ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""The Outer Limits,"" and ""One Step Beyond.""  Spielberg was going to revive the genre with ""Amazing Stories,"" a half-hour anthology series that last two seasons (1985-87), but it did not happen even though he got the likes of Kevin Costner (""The Mission""), Mark Hamill (""Gather Ye Acorns,"" and Sid Caesar (""Mr. Magic"") to star in episodes (not to mention next gen actors like Charlie Sheen and Keifer Sutherland), as well as getting Burt Reynolds (""Guilt Trip""), Clint Eastwood (""Vanessa in the Garden""), Martin Scorcese (""Mirror, Mirror""), Paul Bartel (""Secret Cinema""), and Joe Dante (""Boo!"") to direct (Note: the Michael Moore who directed ""Alamo Jobe"" is not the Michael Moore who did ""Roger & Me"" and other lighthearted documentary fare, but rather Michael D. Moore, who was the second unit director on the Indiana Jones movies).Watching these 24 first-season episodes again, there are many more mundane outings than ones we would consider to be truly amazing.  Spielberg directs two of the episodes, the ""Ghost Train"" pilot and ""The Mission,"" but he came up with the stories for another dozen episodes, so this was clearly his series.  In many ways that first episode, ""Ghost Train,"" represents the series as a whole. The point of the episode is to have a steam locomotive crash through a living room wall and drive a train through a family's house.  That is certainly a compelling image, and we get it from multiple camera angles, but the story that accompanies the stunt is not as good, despite Robert Blossom's performance as Old Pa.  ""The Mission"" is much better offering an effective portrayal of a B-17 bombing mission during World War II going wrong before pulling some magic out of a hat.For me ""Dorothy and Ben"" is far and away the best episode.  Ben Dumfy (Joe Seneca) wakes up after 40 years in a coma to find he is an old man.  He also discovers that he had talk to Dorothy (Natalie Gregory), a 7-year-old girl who has been in a coma for two weeks.  Lane Smith and Louis Giambalvo are the doctors, Kathleen Lloyd and Joe Regalbuto are Dorothy's parents, and I watched these four DVDs because I wanted to watch this episode again (several times in fact).  All of the other episodes I like, such as ""Alamo Jobe,"" ""The Amazing Falsworth,"" and ""The Doll,"" have simple ideas and play them out without becoming truly memorable.  An episode like ""Santa '85"" or Timothy Hutton's ""Grandpa's Ghost"" becomes quite representative, because once you understand the set up you can figure out the payoff.  Even with an episode ""Gather Ye Acorns,"" which I can obviously appreciate because of my own collections of comic books, baseball cards, and Buffy figures, the idea ends up being vastly superior to the execution.  I do not know why, but watching these episodes again was not as enjoyable as watching ""Zone"" episodes the second, third and umpteenth time around.If you do the math most of the episodes are ""Twilight Zone"" like in nature during this first season, including a pair written by Serling's best writer, Richard Matheson (""The Doll"" and ""One for the Books"").  But Spielberg is more willing to come up with humorous episodes, with decidedly mixed results.  ""Mummy Daddy,"" in which an actor playing a mummy in a movie makes the mistake of racing off to the hospital where his wife is giving birth without getting out of his makeup and costume or checking the fuel gauge, is pretty good.  But for the most part ""The Main Attraction,"" ""Fine Tuning,"" ""Guilt Trip,"" ""Boo!,"" and ""Hell Toupee"" try too much and lack the requisite subtlety.  ""Remote Control Man"" and ""Secret Cinema"" have unrealized potential, although any excuse to get Barbara Billingsley on camera is greatly appreciated.  This is why an episode like ""The Sitter,"" where Mabel King plays a sitter who does that voodoo she do so well to young Seth Green and his brother, becomes paradigmatic because obviously Spielberg wants ""Amazing Stories"" to skew a lot younger than Serling did with the ""Zone.""  Consequently, something like ""One for the Road"" may well run a little too dark for the kiddies.",4,"Revisiting Steven Spielberg's ""Amazing Stories"" two decades down the road",1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,4494,"['wake', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'Jaws', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'E.T', 'NBC', 'got', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'create', 'television', 'anthology', 'series', 'Spielberg', 'first', 'directing', 'gig', 'was', 'one', 'early', 'episodes', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'one', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'blind', 'woman', 'course', 'director', 'was', 'weaned', 'classic', 'anthology', 'series', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'One', 'Step', 'Beyond', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'going', 'revive', 'genre', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'half-hour', 'anthology', 'series', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', '1985-87', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'even', 'got', 'likes', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Mission', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'Gather', 'Ye', 'Acorns', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'Mr.', 'Magic', 'star', 'episodes', 'not', 'mention', 'next', 'gen', 'actors', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'as', 'well', 'getting', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Guilt', 'Trip', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Vanessa', 'Garden', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'Paul', 'Bartel', 'Secret', 'Cinema', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'Boo', 'direct', 'Note', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'who', 'directed', 'Alamo', 'Jobe', 'not', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'who', 'did', 'Roger', 'Me', 'other', 'lighthearted', 'documentary', 'fare', 'rather', 'Michael', 'D.', 'Moore', 'who', 'was', 'second', 'unit', 'director', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'movies', '.Watching', '24', 'first-season', 'episodes', 'again', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'mundane', 'outings', 'ones', 'would', 'consider', 'be', 'truly', 'amazing', 'Spielberg', 'two', 'episodes', 'Ghost', 'Train', 'pilot', 'Mission', 'came', 'up', 'stories', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'was', 'clearly', 'series', 'many', 'ways', 'first', 'episode', 'Ghost', 'Train', 'series', 'whole', 'point', 'episode', 'have', 'steam', 'locomotive', 'crash', 'living', 'room', 'wall', 'drive', 'train', 'family', 'house', 'certainly', 'compelling', 'image', 'get', 'multiple', 'camera', 'angles', 'story', 'stunt', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Robert', 'Blossom', 'performance', 'Old', 'Pa.', 'Mission', 'much', 'better', 'offering', 'effective', 'portrayal', 'B-17', 'bombing', 'mission', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'going', 'wrong', 'pulling', 'magic', 'hat.For', 'Dorothy', 'Ben', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'episode', 'Ben', 'Dumfy', 'Joe', 'Seneca', 'up', '40', 'years', 'coma', 'find', 'old', 'man', 'also', 'had', 'talk', 'Dorothy', 'Natalie', 'Gregory', '7-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'coma', 'two', 'weeks', 'Lane', 'Smith', 'Louis', 'Giambalvo', 'are', 'doctors', 'Kathleen', 'Lloyd', 'Joe', 'Regalbuto', 'are', 'Dorothy', 'parents', 'watched', 'four', 'DVDs', 'wanted', 'watch', 'episode', 'again', 'several', 'times', 'fact', 'other', 'episodes', 'like', 'such', 'Alamo', 'Jobe', 'Amazing', 'Falsworth', 'Doll', 'have', 'simple', 'ideas', 'play', 'out', 'becoming', 'truly', 'memorable', 'episode', 'Santa', ""'85"", 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Grandpa', 'Ghost', 'quite', 'representative', 'once', 'understand', 'set', 'up', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'payoff', 'Even', 'episode', 'Gather', 'Ye', 'Acorns', 'can', 'obviously', 'appreciate', 'own', 'collections', 'comic', 'books', 'baseball', 'cards', 'Buffy', 'figures', 'idea', 'up', 'being', 'vastly', 'superior', 'execution', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'watching', 'episodes', 'again', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'watching', 'Zone', 'second', 'third', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'around.If', 'do', 'math', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'nature', 'first', 'season', 'including', 'pair', 'written', 'Serling', 'best', 'writer', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Doll', 'One', 'Books', 'Spielberg', 'more', 'willing', 'come', 'up', 'humorous', 'episodes', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'results', 'Mummy', 'Daddy', 'actor', 'playing', 'mummy', 'movie', 'mistake', 'racing', 'off', 'hospital', 'where', 'wife', 'giving', 'birth', 'getting', 'makeup', 'costume', 'checking', 'fuel', 'gauge', 'pretty', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'Main', 'Attraction', 'Fine', 'Tuning', 'Guilt', 'Trip', 'Boo', 'Hell', 'Toupee', 'try', 'too', 'much', 'requisite', 'subtlety', 'Remote', 'Control', 'Man', 'Secret', 'Cinema', 'have', 'unrealized', 'potential', 'excuse', 'get', 'Barbara', 'Billingsley', 'camera', 'greatly', 'appreciated', 'why', 'episode', 'Sitter', 'where', 'Mabel', 'King', 'sitter', 'who', 'voodoo', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'young', 'Seth', 'Green', 'brother', 'paradigmatic', 'obviously', 'Spielberg', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'skew', 'lot', 'younger', 'Serling', 'did', 'Zone', 'Consequently', 'something', 'One', 'Road', 'may', 'well', 'run', 'little', 'too', 'dark', 'kiddies']",Amazing Stories: The Complete First Season

627790,A3FDO58UAHVQD1,B00005JN8Q,Servo,"[12, 13]","""Amazing Stories"" was the result of a two-season, 45-episode commitment and full creative control deal NBC offered Steven Spielberg to entice the filmmaker into television series production, and Spielberg's own desire to revive the anthology format. Unfortunately, Amazing Stories neither measured up to expectations nor found a large audience.Critics and historians argued the anthology format itself had fallen out of favor years earlier, and efforts to revive it (including two other 1985 offerings, the remakes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" which immediately followed Amazing Stories on Sunday nights at 8:30p) ultimately failed. It probably didn't help that Amazing Stories was up against CBS's ""Murder She Wrote"" and ABC's then-hot new series ""MacGyver"" at the time.While the segments from Amazing Stories were rarely ""amazing"" (though some, of course, were standout episodes), the series itself was an admirable mix of interesting storytelling. And though most of the stories were conceived (and a few directed) by Spielberg himself, the A-list of talent Spielberg amassed for the series (Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, etc.) were used accordingly. That includes legendary composer John Williams who provided the magnificent opening theme that perfectly emcompassed that sense of wonder and imagination associated with Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment.Amazing Stories - The Complete 1st Season is a 4-disc (single-sided) set featuring all 24 episodes from the 1985-1986 season, Full-Frame (1.33:1) Video, English Dolby Digital 5.1 Audio, English and Spanish subtitles, plus extras. The set has a running time of 683 min.

627791,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B00005JN8Q,Traveler,"[5, 8]","When I was younger I remember looking forward to watching this show.  I even had a few episodes recorded off air on VHS that I watched several times - especially ""No Day at the Beach"" (in this set) and ""Family Dog"" (in the second season, not in this set).Even as a teen, however, I remember frequently feeling let down by what I saw versus what was expected - ""amazing"" stories.  In many many episodes there is just zero tension as to what's going to happen next.In ""Ghost Train"" grandpa says the 407 is going to pick him up that night and smash through the house and that's exactly what happens.  Along the way we get to see some borderline campy acting.  Or there were episodes where the solution was just silly nonsensical such as with ""The Mission"" when the fighter plane is saved by a . . . drawing.  Yes, a drawing.The shows tended to either of these two patterns - either a telegraphed plot or a deus ex machina ending.I don't think the issue is just that this show was filmed in the 80s.  I've rewatched many St. Elsewhere episodes and, once they got out of the first season, most are still good by today's standards.  Ditto for ""Hill Street Blues.""After all these years the only episode ever of ""Amazing Stories"" that truly stands the test of time IMO is season two's ""Family Dog.""  I've watched it several times over the years and it's always funny.  Unfortunately, my VHS copy has worn out and it's not included in this set.The only thing that stood out to me by watching these shows was getting to see the earlier/lesser known work of various actors such as Kevin Costner, Kiefer Sutherland, Harvey Keitel and others.  Otherwise, I found myself actually fast forwarding through scenes because they were just too silly. Die hard fans might scoff and, based on the many positive reviews here, the show has held well with many viewers.  It might also be good for parents to show their pre-teen kids given the generally safe stories and topics.",3,"Liked it as a teenager, but it's campy now",1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,1952,"['When', 'was', 'younger', 'remember', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'show', 'even', 'had', 'few', 'episodes', 'recorded', 'off', 'air', 'VHS', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'especially', 'Day', 'Beach', 'set', 'Family', 'Dog', 'second', 'season', 'not', 'set', '.Even', 'teen', 'however', 'remember', 'frequently', 'feeling', 'let', 'down', 'what', 'saw', 'versus', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'amazing', 'stories', 'many', 'many', 'episodes', 'just', 'zero', 'tension', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next.In', 'Ghost', 'Train', 'grandpa', '407', 'going', 'pick', 'up', 'night', 'smash', 'house', 'exactly', 'what', 'way', 'get', 'see', 'borderline', 'campy', 'acting', 'were', 'episodes', 'where', 'solution', 'was', 'just', 'silly', 'nonsensical', 'such', 'Mission', 'when', 'fighter', 'plane', 'saved', 'drawing', 'Yes', 'drawing.The', 'shows', 'tended', 'two', 'patterns', 'telegraphed', 'plot', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'ending.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'issue', 'just', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', '80s', ""'ve"", 'rewatched', 'many', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'episodes', 'once', 'got', 'first', 'season', 'most', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'today', 'standards', 'Ditto', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'years', 'only', 'episode', 'ever', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'truly', 'test', 'time', 'IMO', 'season', 'two', 'Family', 'Dog', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'years', 'always', 'funny', 'Unfortunately', 'VHS', 'copy', 'worn', 'out', 'not', 'included', 'set.The', 'only', 'thing', 'stood', 'out', 'watching', 'shows', 'was', 'getting', 'see', 'earlier/lesser', 'known', 'work', 'various', 'actors', 'such', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'others', 'Otherwise', 'found', 'actually', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'silly', 'Die', 'hard', 'fans', 'might', 'scoff', 'based', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'here', 'show', 'held', 'well', 'many', 'viewers', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'good', 'parents', 'show', 'pre-teen', 'kids', 'given', 'generally', 'safe', 'stories', 'topics']",Amazing Stories: The Complete First Season
