1673775,A2XXBZPQT5EXHV,B00FYV7WAQ,Darren O'Neill,"[11, 11]","&#34;A Case of You&#34; is a quiet little romantic comedy for the Internet age.  It's about a struggling writer named Sam, played by Justin Long, that one day meets what he believes is the girl of his dreams in Birdie, played by Evan Rachel Wood, at his local coffee shop.  Rather than just pursue her, Sam decides to find her on Facebook and find out everything and anything that he can about her so that he could mold himself into the perfect man for her.For me, it is the Facebook twist that makes this movie interesting as it has become increasingly easy for relative strangers to find out some very intimate things about someone without them divulging the information directly.  Ten years ago if you met someone new and they liked the same bands as you or the same authors as you then you knew you had something in common.  Now, that has all changed and instead you could just be dealing with someone that has seen your profile online.The movie does a good job of showing Sam as a well-intentioned guy who just doesn't have a whole lot of skill with the ladies instead of putting him into the Internet stalker category.  I found myself rooting for him to come out of the shadow of the guy he created and to just be himself.The movie has an excellent supporting cast with Vince Vaughn, Sam Rockwell,Sienna Miller, Brendan Fraser and Busy Philipps making appearances.It is a heartfelt story and one that I'd think most people would enjoy.

1673776,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B00FYV7WAQ,DVD Verdict,"[0, 0]","A Case of You is a romantic comedy, and as such we have to expect certain things from it. There will be a couple, there will be a misunderstanding, true love will be revealed, and despite obstacles, the couple will get together. There will even be other quirky characters along the way. A Case of You does a little too much with the latter, and not enough with the former. The overall plot is rote boy-meets-girl stuff, with the angle of Sam looking for material. That's the &#34;hook&#34; that A Case of You hangs its misunderstandings on. It's not a horrible hook as far as it goes, but despite the numerous opportunities, the film has to do something new with the material, it doesn't. On the flip side, A Case of You over-invests in packing the film with &#34;quirky&#34; characters. Individually, they're amusing; I especially love Peter Dinklage's weird creation as Birdie's co-worker. However, as a parade they detract from the focus on Sam and Birdie, which is both tiresome and shows just how empty the central &#34;romance&#34; is.The one thing you can't take away from A Case of You is the cast. Though Long has been playing this kind of hapless, half-smarmy character for a while, everyone else feels surprisingly fresh. Evan Rachel Wood is charming as Birdie, and it's not hard to see why. We also get a fun appearance by Sam Rockwell as Sam's guitar teacher, and everyone from Brendan Frasier to Sienna Miller shows up to fill out the cast. Sam's editor is even played by Vince Vaughn. Peter Dinklage also once again proves he's one of the most talented actors working as he plays Birdie's co-worker. I'd have rather seen a film just about him. I don't know what Long and director Kat Coiro had on these actors to get them to appear, but it elevates the movie.The film is also not terrible. I think, given the cast, that it could have and should have been better. However, what's here is executed with energy and skill. That means those who want just another romantic comedy to watch can appreciate the expected twists and turns in the Sam and Birdie story. Fans of the actors will get to see their favorites take on quirky roles. There is some pleasure to be had, therefore, even if it's not as much as the talent involved would suggest.A Case of You (Blu-ray) is also pretty strong. The 2.40:1/1080p AVC-encoded transfer is full of rich detail. There are a lot of bright scenes that showcases nice textures, and the interior scenes of Sam and Birdie's hobbies are similarly impressive. Colors are well-saturated, and black levels stay consistent and deep. No significant digital artefacts crop up. Similarly, the DTS-HD 5.1 audio track keeps dialogue clean and clear. The surround don't get a lot of use, but there is some directionality to establish atmosphere.The set's extras include a set of interviews with the usual suspects. They're informative and light, complimenting the movie perfectly. The film's trailer is also available. Given the homegrown nature of the script (written by Long, his brother Christian, and co-star Keir O'Donnell), a commentary would have been nice.A Case of You is one of those films that sets itself a modest goal and achieves it. If you're looking for a simple rom-com with a lot of great actors, then this will probably fit the bill. If you want something particularly clever or original from your romantic comedies, this probably isn't the film for you. In either case, the decent A Case of You (Blu-ray) that's worth a rental to the interested.Gordon Sullivan, DVD VERDICTRead the full review at dvdverdict.com",4,Fans of the actors will get to see their favorites take on quirky roles,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,3564,"['Case', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'such', 'have', 'expect', 'certain', 'things', 'will', 'be', 'couple', 'will', 'be', 'misunderstanding', 'true', 'love', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'obstacles', 'couple', 'will', 'get', 'together', 'will', 'even', 'be', 'other', 'quirky', 'characters', 'way', 'Case', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'latter', 'not', 'enough', 'former', 'overall', 'plot', 'rote', 'boy-meets-girl', 'stuff', 'angle', 'Sam', 'looking', 'material', '34', 'hook', '34', 'Case', 'hangs', 'misunderstandings', 'not', 'horrible', 'hook', 'as', 'far', 'numerous', 'opportunities', 'film', 'do', 'something', 'new', 'material', ""n't"", 'flip', 'side', 'Case', 'over-invests', 'packing', 'film', '34', 'quirky', '34', 'characters', 'Individually', ""'re"", 'amusing', 'especially', 'love', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'weird', 'creation', 'Birdie', 'co-worker', 'However', 'parade', 'detract', 'focus', 'Sam', 'Birdie', 'tiresome', 'just', 'how', 'empty', 'central', '34', 'romance', '34', 'is.The', 'one', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'A', 'Case', 'cast', 'Though', 'Long', 'been', 'playing', 'kind', 'hapless', 'half-smarmy', 'character', 'while', 'everyone', 'else', 'surprisingly', 'fresh', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'charming', 'Birdie', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'also', 'get', 'fun', 'appearance', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Sam', 'guitar', 'teacher', 'everyone', 'Brendan', 'Frasier', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'up', 'fill', 'out', 'cast', 'Sam', 'editor', 'even', 'played', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'also', 'once', 'again', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'actors', 'working', 'Birdie', 'co-worker', ""'d"", 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'film', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Long', 'director', 'Kat', 'Coiro', 'had', 'actors', 'get', 'appear', 'movie.The', 'film', 'also', 'not', 'terrible', 'think', 'given', 'cast', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'However', 'what', 'here', 'executed', 'energy', 'skill', 'who', 'want', 'just', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'watch', 'can', 'appreciate', 'expected', 'twists', 'turns', 'Sam', 'Birdie', 'story', 'Fans', 'actors', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'favorites', 'take', 'quirky', 'roles', 'pleasure', 'be', 'had', 'therefore', 'even', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'talent', 'involved', 'would', 'suggest.A', 'Case', 'Blu-ray', 'also', 'pretty', 'strong', '2.40:1/1080p', 'AVC-encoded', 'transfer', 'full', 'rich', 'detail', 'are', 'lot', 'bright', 'scenes', 'nice', 'textures', 'interior', 'scenes', 'Sam', 'Birdie', 'hobbies', 'are', 'similarly', 'impressive', 'Colors', 'are', 'well-saturated', 'black', 'levels', 'stay', 'consistent', 'deep', 'significant', 'digital', 'artefacts', 'crop', 'up', 'Similarly', 'DTS-HD', '5.1', 'audio', 'track', 'dialogue', 'clean', 'clear', 'surround', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'use', 'directionality', 'establish', 'atmosphere.The', 'set', 'extras', 'include', 'set', 'interviews', 'usual', 'suspects', ""'re"", 'informative', 'light', 'complimenting', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'film', 'trailer', 'also', 'available', 'Given', 'homegrown', 'nature', 'script', 'written', 'Long', 'brother', 'Christian', 'co-star', 'Keir', ""O'Donnell"", 'commentary', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice.A', 'Case', 'one', 'films', 'modest', 'goal', ""'re"", 'looking', 'simple', 'rom-com', 'lot', 'great', 'actors', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'fit', 'bill', 'want', 'something', 'particularly', 'clever', 'original', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'probably', ""n't"", 'film', 'case', 'decent', 'Case', 'Blu-ray', 'rental', 'interested.Gordon', 'Sullivan', 'DVD', 'VERDICTRead', 'full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",A Case of You

So in order to get her he pretends as though all her interests and likes are his likes and dislikes. He does so because he thinks she is totally out of her league.When I watch Indie films and see things go wrong for a young protagonist, I often think it is a bit forced and think oh my God, why do actors to pretend this John Cera like awkwardness about them?Justin Long has no such pretentious demeanor in his portrayal of SAM. I was laughing out loud. There are some really exclusive funny scenes with Peter Dinklage (he is absolutely brilliant in his short role, no pun) and even Sam Rockwell who I mostly can't stand. Even Brendon Frazer has a nice five minutes.I liked the acting a lot. You have to make them believable in comedy and forced self deprecation. This is where A CASE OF YOU truly shines and comes to its own. I can't figure the low rating on imdb. This is far more real than other indie films that hollywood churned out in 2013. It also has a great point but let me not bore you into that.If I could change something about the film I'd change the approach to the end, the last scene was somehow pulverised by an element of cliched cheesyness which most of the film entirely lacked.

1673779,A55RQ26WDPSM0,B00FYV7WAQ,Iusedtobeacat,"[0, 0]","This movie is your cliched boy meets girl scenario,Sam an aspiring writer (who only gets hired by production companies to write books based on pre existing movies such as teen wolf) is struggling to create his own original content and creating a name for himself besides being known as a hacker writer. One day he meets Birdie a cashier at a local coffee shop, and you guessed it he gets intrigued, interested, finds her on Facebook, stalks her on Facebook and create a character for himself based on what he thinks is the man of her dreams from the information he could find on Facebook. The only problem is she gets fired from the coffee shop so he had to find another way to communicate with her and see her in person and so he does through Facebook. They meet, talk, go for a walk and finally start dating, get to know each other better, kiss, sleep together, do hobbies together and etc... falls in love? But will she love the real him? or the person she thinks is him.Well, the issue I had with this problem is this, lack of originality. This is your cookie cutter of a romantic movie. The lead male character breaks up with the female character 15 min to the end of the film. So convinced that she doesn't know him and only loves what she think he is. Then after finishing off his book who is based on his relationship with Birdie he realises that she's the love of his life and they should be together and just runs back to her, confronts his feelings, confronts the truth and guess what? she already knew he was basing himself off her Facebook page but she still had feelings for him awww so so sweet. *sarcasm*The cast is lovely, the characters though not so much. Sam like every other male has commitment problems yet does not want to die alone. Those commitment problems aren't exactly explained, has he had his heart broken? has his mother leaving him and his father had anything to do with it? He was too eager to have Birdie so why be so eager to leave her behind without a second glance? after all what he did to make her like him? Why walk away? and most importantly why have low self esteem and not just present yourself as you instead of someone else? Why was he so surprised when she said she loved him? And most importantly why did she love him?Too much questions, plot holes and thoughts come to mind. I know I know it's just a movie but Sam wasn't likeable as a character. He was too self absorbed, and too proud to admit his feelings as well as having very little confidence. Birdie on the other hand was all over the place going from one hobby to the other without having to do much work if any at all. Painting people in the street can hardly pay off your mortgage, rent, taxes, Dance classes etc... Come on! She comes across as a free spirit hippie with little to no security and worries in life. Too unrealistic.In the end of the day, this movie wasn't funny. It was watchable but surely boring. I had no network connection and this was in my files so I watched it to waste my time and it did eventually. That should be it's only purpose.The visuals were pretty enough and it had a vintage outlook so I guess that explains the 2 stars?

He has no idea how to approach her until his friend brings up the idea of looking at her Facebook profile. Sam studies what he sees and becomes everything she is looking for. When she begins to fall for him Sam rethinks his choices. I am really becoming a Justin Long fan. In every movie he is in he is very easy to like and very funny. After the amazing Best Man Down movie I was looking forward to seeing this. While this wasn't as good as that one this was still very enjoyable. What could have been a generic cookie cutter romantic comedy was changed just enough to make it interesting and fun to watch. The best part was that it wasn't 100% predictable, more like 90% but still... The movie is more or less about a non-creepy (not totally at least) stalker who gets the girl by not being himself. It had the possibility of being totally creepy and borderline scary but the performances and the writing made it sweet and funny. I did like this quite a bit and recommend it. Overall, the sweetest and least creepy stalker movie I have ever seen.
