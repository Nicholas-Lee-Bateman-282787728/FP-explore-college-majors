I'm an experienced exerciser (working out daily for the last 25 years). I prefer Cathe or Amy mostly, but like a variety. I found that Kathy is very natural and motivating in this one. She also looks nicely toned. I liked how intense the sculpt and core workouts are making the most use of the time spent. I really think what Kathy does best is core work though. It's delicious, tough and unique. Overall, there is a lot of twisting and rotating to incorporate core and obliques which an intermediate to advanced exerciser can handle, but beginners may not know how it feels to use the correct form and could hurt themselves.

The stomach section is also challenging and different than some other conventional workouts.The fact is that when you are stepping and lunging at awkward angles, when you are moving your arms and legs at the same time, and when you are carrying weights simultaneously, then you are feeling too busy to feel bored. Your mind is too engaged trying to maintain all of these activities at once. That prevents the workout from becoming boring. So, I applaud her in creating a unique and challenging workout. It's good toning and the cardiovascular aspect gets worked, too.The additional instructor in the bonus segment at the end really introduces us to an advanced way of working out, too. The types of push ups she does while lifting up a leg at the same time is pretty impressive, and Kathy Smith even has a hard time keeping up.All in all, if you opt for using weights, then this definitely is a workout for advanced exercisers.Great workout!

I was not impressed with Kathy's ""Lift Weights Volume Two,"" but I thought I'd give this ""Matrix Method"" a whirl since the review sounded good.  It is!  Kathy must be getting up there in age, but not only does she look FAB in this workout (either the lighting is good or exercise IS the key to staying young!), she provides the participant with an excellent sculpt routine.  I have seen many of these particular ""core"" moves in other workouts, but for this workout, I would suggest that beginner levels first attempt this workout without using the weights, only because the moves and pace are fast and one could easily get hurt.  Intermediate levels may want to begin with lighter weights (3-5 lbs) and work up to heavier if appropriate.  Advanced may be able to breeze through this workout as is and use heavier weights.  Regardless, a great workout will be achieved.  I used ankle weights and alternated dumbbell weights (8-12 lbs), and I was able to execute the moves and I will tell you--I felt every bit of it!Apparently, Kathy Smith ""discovered"" one of the participants, ""Angela,"" and her ""Matrix Workout"" at a popular gym, and Kathy provides an additional interview with Angela explaining the basis of this routine, as well as an approximate ten-minute advanced routine led by Angela.  As for this workout, the entire tone of the workout is upbeat, the filming, state-of-the-art, yet not distracting, the participants seem fresh and as if they are having a great time--different participants work at different levels, which provides the at-home participant with options.  Some of the participants are at top level, some mid-level, and some, like Nancy Walker, a veteran of Kathy's workouts, is at the beginner-option level, so everyone who wants to attempt this workout can because there are options.  The workout is tough, but good; fun, yet effective.  I enjoy circuit-type workouts, and while this is not a straight cardio workout, if one is beginning or using the weights and executing maximum effort, you will feel the heart pumping and receive some heartrate response!  I mentioned that I was not impressed with Kathy's ""Lift Weights Vol. 2"" workout...it seems slapped together and sloppy, and Kathy is not at her best.  This workout is fresh with plenty of moves to keep one's body in tip-top shape, and Kathy herself looks great and is in top form for the workout as well.  I would definitely recommend this workout as part of one's routine.  I can feel and see the benefits already after only one week, and it's great to see that Kathy's back with an excellent workout routine.  Aside from a few glitches in the filming (I caught a cord dangling in front of the camera, as well as someone's hand briefly waving across the lens...and yes, there are a few moves which Kathy does not repeat on the other side), this workout will do the job providing shape and tone to one's body!  I may edit this review after working out with the DVD for a few more weeks, which is usually when I notice some ""intricacies"" I may have ommitted; however, at this point, I love this workout!***To update:  I have been working out to ""The Matrix"" every week since purchase (it's basically my Saturday workout), and the benefits are really amazing!

1004086,A13700AF4X40YG,B000GH3CC0,Loves Books in MD,"[95, 96]","I've been using this workout for a few weeks now and have really enjoyed it.  Although just a few minutes over 30 minutes for the Ultimate Sculpt portion of the DVD, you're dripping with sweat when it's over and feel sore the next day in a good way.I've been exercising consistently 5-7 times a week for 3 years, primarily using The Firm for sculpting and Richard Simmons and The Firm for cardio.  So I was surprised at the level of soreness I felt from the workouts - but even more so from WHERE I was sore.  Like one of the other reviewers, I felt soreness in my rib cage area, but also from another hard to target area in the butt/glute/upper-side leg area.The exercises themselves are different from the norm, which may explain why frequent exercisers are experiencing a surprising level of soreness afterward.  This has made this DVD become a regular in my rotation.  I was born without a waist :) and I am hopeful that maybe this routine will give me firmness at the side of my waist, even if my build isn't likely to develop a real defined waist. The time moves by quickly through the routine.  It's a nice balance of being neither tricky or boring.  There is variety in the movements, but no real ""choreography"" that you have to learn - just watch and follow.One caution:  I would suggest starting out using a lighter weight for many of the moves than you would typically use in a sculpting routine.  Why?  Well, many of the moves involve a certain amount of lunging or twisting or bending.  The first time I did this routine was almost my last, as after just 10 minutes, my admittedly sensitive back was complaining and I had to stop.  I would have written this one off, but I'll confess the rib-cage soreness the next day - and after just 10 minutes of this tape - made me want to try it again because it's such an unusual place to feel muscle soreness.  So I backed it down from 7.5 to a 2.5 pound weight (Bowflex Adjustable, which increases in 2.5 increments, hence the weird amounts)and am very careful with form and have had no problems and have increased to 5 pounds, where I think I'll stay, as that's giving me a good workout.I'd recommend watching through this DVD before working out to it - or doing it without weights the first time.  This may help give you a better idea of what size weight to use.  Though this DVD is named ""ultimate sculpting"", Kathy suggests doing it some days without weights. I also consider it a cardio workout because she has your heart rate elevated and I'm always soaked when done.I have several of Kathy Smith's workouts and this is probably my most favorite of them.  I will probably use other workouts for a true upper body sculpting routine, but I think this is an excellent addition, particularly for those parts of the body often missed (at least judging from my soreness) by them.  This is available on Netflix if you want to trial this before buying - but with a price under [...], you can't go wrong.",5,Great Workout - Seems to Target,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,2956,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'using', 'workout', 'few', 'weeks', 'now', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', '30', 'minutes', 'Ultimate', 'Sculpt', 'portion', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'dripping', 'sweat', 'when', 'feel', 'sore', 'next', 'day', 'good', 'way.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'exercising', 'consistently', '5-7', 'times', 'week', '3', 'years', 'primarily', 'using', 'Firm', 'sculpting', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'Firm', 'cardio', 'was', 'surprised', 'level', 'soreness', 'felt', 'workouts', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'WHERE', 'was', 'sore', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'felt', 'soreness', 'rib', 'cage', 'area', 'also', 'hard', 'target', 'area', 'butt/glute/upper-side', 'leg', 'area.The', 'are', 'different', 'norm', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'frequent', 'exercisers', 'are', 'experiencing', 'surprising', 'level', 'soreness', 'afterward', 'made', 'DVD', 'become', 'regular', 'rotation', 'was', 'born', 'waist', 'am', 'hopeful', 'maybe', 'routine', 'will', 'give', 'firmness', 'side', 'waist', 'even', 'build', ""n't"", 'likely', 'develop', 'real', 'defined', 'waist', 'time', 'moves', 'quickly', 'routine', 'nice', 'balance', 'being', 'tricky', 'boring', 'variety', 'movements', 'real', 'choreography', 'have', 'learn', 'just', 'watch', 'follow.One', 'caution', 'would', 'suggest', 'starting', 'out', 'using', 'lighter', 'weight', 'many', 'moves', 'would', 'typically', 'use', 'sculpting', 'routine', 'Why', 'Well', 'many', 'moves', 'involve', 'certain', 'amount', 'lunging', 'twisting', 'bending', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'routine', 'was', 'almost', 'last', 'just', '10', 'minutes', 'admittedly', 'sensitive', 'back', 'was', 'complaining', 'had', 'stop', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'one', 'off', ""'ll"", 'confess', 'rib-cage', 'soreness', 'next', 'day', 'just', '10', 'minutes', 'tape', 'made', 'want', 'try', 'again', 'such', 'unusual', 'place', 'feel', 'muscle', 'soreness', 'backed', 'down', '7.5', '2.5', 'pound', 'weight', 'Bowflex', 'Adjustable', '2.5', 'increments', 'hence', 'weird', 'amounts', 'am', 'very', 'careful', 'form', 'have', 'had', 'problems', 'have', 'increased', '5', 'pounds', 'where', 'think', ""'ll"", 'stay', 'giving', 'good', 'workout.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'DVD', 'working', 'out', 'doing', 'weights', 'first', 'time', 'may', 'help', 'give', 'better', 'idea', 'what', 'size', 'weight', 'use', 'DVD', 'named', 'ultimate', 'sculpting', 'Kathy', 'doing', 'days', 'weights', 'also', 'consider', 'cardio', 'workout', 'heart', 'rate', 'elevated', ""'m"", 'always', 'soaked', 'when', 'done.I', 'have', 'several', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'workouts', 'probably', 'most', 'favorite', 'will', 'probably', 'use', 'other', 'workouts', 'true', 'upper', 'body', 'sculpting', 'routine', 'think', 'excellent', 'addition', 'particularly', 'parts', 'body', 'often', 'missed', 'least', 'judging', 'soreness', 'available', 'Netflix', 'want', 'trial', 'buying', 'price', '[', ']', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong']",Kathy Smith - Matrix Method - Ultimate Sculpt

You can tell from just watching it that it'll be a good, all-over workout. Although after viewing it I was a little concerned about being able to manage doing it entirely, I was relieved that I could afterall. I really sweat a lot each time, so I sip on water throughout. I like that the DVD breaks the workout down into multiple parts so that you can choose which segments to do (if not all), depending on how much time you have on any given day. So, you can do as little as 10 minutes and get a good workout, or you can do as much as 30 minutes (or more). Also, I like the Matrix moves. And she works the ab muscles in different ways than I've known before, a lot even while standing vs. laying on the floor. Plus, you can really feel the abs working. I've already lost 4-5 inches off my stomach and 17 pounds, and this workout combined with her Power Walk for Weight Loss, which I like even better, (in addition to cutting calories) is mainly what I owe it to in just two months time so far.Kathy Smith - Matrix Method - Power Walk for Weight Loss",4,"A Good, All-Over Workout...",1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,1145,"['watched', 'workout', 'prior', 'doing', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'familiar', 'what', 'expect', 'can', 'tell', 'just', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'be', 'good', 'all-over', 'workout', 'viewing', 'was', 'little', 'concerned', 'being', 'able', 'manage', 'doing', 'entirely', 'was', 'relieved', 'could', 'afterall', 'really', 'sweat', 'lot', 'time', 'sip', 'water', 'like', 'DVD', 'workout', 'down', 'multiple', 'parts', 'can', 'choose', 'segments', 'do', 'not', 'depending', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'have', 'given', 'day', 'So', 'can', 'do', 'as', 'little', '10', 'minutes', 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'can', 'do', 'as', 'much', '30', 'minutes', 'more', 'Also', 'like', 'Matrix', 'moves', 'ab', 'muscles', 'different', 'ways', ""'ve"", 'known', 'lot', 'even', 'standing', 'vs.', 'laying', 'floor', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'abs', 'working', ""'ve"", 'already', 'lost', '4-5', 'inches', 'stomach', '17', 'pounds', 'workout', 'combined', 'Power', 'Walk', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'like', 'even', 'better', 'addition', 'cutting', 'calories', 'mainly', 'what', 'owe', 'just', 'two', 'months', 'time', 'so', 'far.Kathy', 'Smith', 'Matrix', 'Method', 'Power', 'Walk', 'Weight', 'Loss']",Kathy Smith - Matrix Method - Ultimate Sculpt

Then at the beginning of the year I noticed I hit a plateau. I also noticed that I wasn't feeling challenged and worked out with my other forms of exercise. So I went on a hunt for something new and different. This is where Kathy Smith comes into the picture. I saw an ad in my Weight Watchers magazine for this workout dvd. I decided to look it up here at Amazon and read the reviews. With such good reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I have to say that I am NOT disappointed. I've been doing this workout 4 to 5 days a week for the last month and I can see a difference in the shape of my body. My husband has been very impressed with the changes, too. I still mix up the exercise routines with the aforementioned and Kathy Smith. I don't want my body hitting another plateau. This workout is tough but great. I highly recommend this dvd to those who consider themselves intermediate or better. I don't recommend it to beginners, though Kathy does have a woman who is supposed to be a beginner so that beginners can follow along. I personally believe it would be too much for a beginner which would and could cause discouragement.",5,Great workout but definitely not for beginners...,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,1253,"['usually', 'get', 'exercise', 'jogging', 'walking', 'treadmill', 'working', 'out', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'strength', 'training', 'Then', 'beginning', 'year', 'noticed', 'hit', 'plateau', 'also', 'noticed', 'was', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'challenged', 'worked', 'out', 'other', 'forms', 'exercise', 'went', 'hunt', 'something', 'new', 'different', 'where', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'picture', 'saw', 'ad', 'Weight', 'Watchers', 'magazine', 'workout', 'dvd', 'decided', 'look', 'up', 'here', 'Amazon', 'read', 'reviews', 'such', 'good', 'reviews', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'NOT', 'disappointed', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'workout', '4', '5', 'days', 'week', 'last', 'month', 'can', 'see', 'difference', 'shape', 'body', 'husband', 'been', 'very', 'impressed', 'changes', 'too', 'still', 'mix', 'up', 'exercise', 'aforementioned', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'body', 'hitting', 'plateau', 'workout', 'tough', 'great', 'highly', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'who', 'consider', 'intermediate', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'beginners', 'Kathy', 'have', 'woman', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'beginner', 'beginners', 'can', 'follow', 'along', 'personally', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'beginner', 'would', 'could', 'cause', 'discouragement']",Kathy Smith - Matrix Method - Ultimate Sculpt
