I do record and watch it on tv or buy episodes off of iTunes for my iPad so I can watch it anywhere. This is a skit comedy show that makes fun of movies, tv shows and celebrities. It even makes fun of itself. It is based on the humour magazine, MAD. I haven't read it, so I can't compare this to that or MADtv. There seem to mixed opinions about this show, but I think it's funny just for how silly it is. I also think that it's a show that kids and adults can enjoy. There are lot of sketches that parody movies and shows that most kids won't be familiar with, but you don't have to be familiar with said movies or shows to enjoy the skits. Although, the skits might have spoilers for the movies or shows they parody, so if you don't want spoilers for said movies or shows, then you'll want to watch them before seeing the skits. There are also short funny scenes, Spy vs. Spy [about two spies always trying to outwit each other], and fake commercials. This dvd has 13 11-minute episodes. The Season One Part Two dvd has the same amount of episodes. I wanted to write that here so that no one thinks they're getting 13 half hour episodes. So if you're looking for a funny cartoon, I would recommend this. Although, as I've said before, there seem to be mixed opinions about this show, so you may want to check out a few episodes before deciding whether or not to get this.",5,It's MAD funny!,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,1463,"['actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'dvd', '[', 'least', 'not', 'now', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'dvd', 'quality', 'do', 'record', 'watch', 'tv', 'buy', 'episodes', 'iTunes', 'iPad', 'can', 'watch', 'anywhere', 'skit', 'comedy', 'show', 'fun', 'movies', 'tv', 'shows', 'celebrities', 'even', 'fun', 'based', 'humour', 'magazine', 'MAD', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'MADtv', 'seem', 'mixed', 'opinions', 'show', 'think', 'funny', 'just', 'how', 'silly', 'also', 'think', 'show', 'kids', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'are', 'lot', 'sketches', 'parody', 'movies', 'most', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'familiar', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'familiar', 'said', 'movies', 'shows', 'enjoy', 'skits', 'skits', 'might', 'have', 'spoilers', 'movies', 'parody', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoilers', 'said', 'movies', 'shows', 'then', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'seeing', 'skits', 'are', 'also', 'short', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Spy', 'vs.', 'Spy', '[', 'two', 'spies', 'always', 'trying', 'outwit', 'other', ']', 'fake', 'commercials', 'dvd', '13', '11-minute', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One', 'Part', 'Two', 'dvd', 'same', 'amount', 'episodes', 'wanted', 'write', 'here', 'so', 'one', ""'re"", 'getting', '13', 'half', 'hour', 'episodes', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'funny', 'cartoon', 'would', 'recommend', ""'ve"", 'said', 'seem', 'be', 'mixed', 'opinions', 'show', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'few', 'episodes', 'deciding', 'not', 'get']","MAD Season 1, Part 1"

MAD TV at least had a FEW good bits to it, however this show seems to be ""written"" by former SNL writers who were fired because the sketches they came up with bombed.The ""comedy"" is so puerile, it makes the jokes on the side of a Happy Meal box look complex.This show wants to pass off as being for children, and I agree. That is if Sesame Street is too advanced for your child.Scratch that, I don't think this diarrhea of a show is worthy to be viewed by anyone, living or dead...although I'm sure that if you did sit a dead person down to watch this show, it would bring them back to life just long enough to switch the TV off.",1,Minus 5 Stars,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,765,"['show', 'only', 'funny', 'infants', 'people', 'suffering', 'severe', 'brain', 'damage.The', 'fact', 'name', 'MAD', 'nothing', 'MAD', 'TV', 'least', 'had', 'FEW', 'good', 'bits', 'however', 'show', 'be', 'written', 'former', 'SNL', 'writers', 'who', 'were', 'fired', 'sketches', 'came', 'up', 'bombed.The', 'comedy', 'so', 'puerile', 'jokes', 'side', 'Happy', 'Meal', 'box', 'look', 'complex.This', 'show', 'pass', 'off', 'being', 'children', 'agree', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'too', 'advanced', 'child.Scratch', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'diarrhea', 'show', 'worthy', 'be', 'viewed', 'anyone', 'living', 'dead', ""'m"", 'sure', 'did', 'sit', 'dead', 'person', 'down', 'watch', 'show', 'would', 'bring', 'back', 'life', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'switch', 'TV', 'off']","MAD Season 1, Part 1"
1441781,AVMAHVWDGNOKK,B0054DPM1K,Rock~N~Rolla,"[1, 1]","I've been a fan of MAD magazine since I can remember. Since the Seventies sometime, and I even still subscribe to the magazine. I have a young child in the house who loves to watch all of the latest shows for kids, and this show came on one day and caught my attention and from that day on I've been hooked.Each episode is like an animated version of the magazine. You get the movie and TV show spoofs, the celebrity parodies, lampooned commercials, and other animated segments such as Spy vs Spy, Sergio Aragones clips, and Don Martin gags. It's all there and more in great 11 minute episodes. The voice talent cast is excellent as well and really adds a lot to the jokes being presented. In fact, some of the gags based on pop culture and celebrity icons that I am not very familar with are still hilarious just to hear the zany voices blather on!If you are looking for some silly entertainment to lighten up your mood and give you some good hearty laughs then you'll be glad that you got MAD.",5,So glad I got MAD,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,995,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'MAD', 'magazine', 'can', 'remember', 'Seventies', 'sometime', 'even', 'still', 'subscribe', 'magazine', 'have', 'young', 'child', 'house', 'who', 'watch', 'latest', 'shows', 'kids', 'show', 'came', 'one', 'day', 'caught', 'attention', 'day', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hooked.Each', 'episode', 'animated', 'version', 'magazine', 'get', 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'spoofs', 'celebrity', 'parodies', 'lampooned', 'commercials', 'other', 'animated', 'segments', 'such', 'Spy', 'vs', 'Spy', 'Sergio', 'Aragones', 'clips', 'Don', 'Martin', 'gags', 'there', 'more', 'great', '11', 'minute', 'episodes', 'voice', 'talent', 'cast', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'lot', 'jokes', 'being', 'presented', 'fact', 'gags', 'based', 'pop', 'culture', 'celebrity', 'icons', 'am', 'not', 'very', 'familar', 'are', 'still', 'hilarious', 'just', 'hear', 'zany', 'blather', 'are', 'looking', 'silly', 'entertainment', 'lighten', 'up', 'mood', 'give', 'good', 'hearty', 'laughs', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'got', 'MAD']","MAD Season 1, Part 1"
