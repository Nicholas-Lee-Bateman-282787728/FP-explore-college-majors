It's actually kind of edgy for a 90's era Jennifer Aniston flick.  Ione Skye is gorgeous as ALWAYS and everyone in the cast is terrific.  When this was originally released a lot of my film-snob friends snubbed it but it's been one of my absolute favorites for years.  I hope others will discover it too!,5,"great cast, guilty pleasure",1195171200,"11 16, 2007",2007,386,"['movie', 'really', 'great', 'take', 'what', 'fun', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'actually', 'kind', 'edgy', '90', 'era', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'flick', 'Ione', 'Skye', 'gorgeous', 'ALWAYS', 'everyone', 'cast', 'terrific', 'When', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'lot', 'film-snob', 'friends', 'snubbed', 'been', 'one', 'absolute', 'years', 'hope', 'others', 'will', 'discover', 'too']",Dream for An Insomniac VHS

Patty Duke's son, Mackenzie Astin, is dreamy as the lead to Ione Skye's ideal love interest.  Her vision of the perfect man was Frank Sinatra, and Mac enters the scene and captures her heart.

This is a very underrated romantic comedy. Intelligent as hell. Tons of chemistry between Mackenzie Astin and Ione Skye, the two main characters. Great supporting role by Michael Landes, who plays Ione Skye's cousin in the film. And Jennifer Aniston is great, too, as the ditzy best friend of Frankie (Ione Skye).The first 15 minutes or so of this film are in black and white, and then it switches to color, very creatively I must say. The story is just fantastic. Any movie that quotes stuff always gets my attention... some of the references made in the film via quotes are Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Morrissey, Jim Morrison/The Doors, Kurt Cobain, and legendary philosophers like Aristotle and stuff. Brilliant screenwriting by Tiffanie Debartolo. I wish she'd make more films!Ione Skye fans should also check out Gas Food Lodging.... yet another insanely underrated film.I'll end this review by saying Dream For An Insomniac is a dream come true for a hopeless romantic (including me). It's released on DVD now (finally), and it's cheap.If you have a heart, if you're remotely romantic in any way, buy this film. ""Chick flicks"" are not just for women.

Although Ione Skye plays the girl who hasn't slept a full night since age  six, and is a truly beautiful girl, her acting is not consistantly great.  But Jennifer Aniston fills in with her excellent (and often underrated)  supporting acting, as the friend of Skye, helping her to find the one man  who will satisfy a dream she has of the type she wants for her love. (  Pardon me, but Ione Skye, with a few more pounds, would look a lot like  Monica Lewinski.) The script and production is excellent and if you want a  &quot;sweet&quot; ending, you've got.

Ione Skye's (Frankie)character is frankly unlikeable, she is a self involved bore who seems to be living on another planet from the rest of her friends.
