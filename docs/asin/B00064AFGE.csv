Hustler films always have an element of hotness (I am not sure why that is), this one even had a plausible plot (though a little coincidental at time) and some decent characters. The story was a love triangle (more like a square), with some predictable elements and few surprises; though filmed on a no budget the film had a very polished, manicured look with some very well done cinematic scenes. Though the film was visually pleasing, I felt it was lacking a bit in depth (dramatic tension), the storyline was a bit trite and predictable and I really didnt find the character of Conrad passionate enough to provoke any interest for me.

Maybe compared to all films it would rate 3.5 stars. I have a rule that certain films are judged not in comparison to all other films, but to others within the currently sparsely populated genre of gay drama.The central problem facing a reviewer of gay, non-porn movies, as I see it, is there are not enough of them to make valid comparisons. There are maybe ten thousand hetero titles in existence, and maybe a hundred gay. Therefore a gay movie does not really have to be all that good to deserve watching. A radical affirmative-action concept maybe, but only a temporary one, which I will abandon when there is enough proliferation. The thing is, we don't want to poop on the up and coming gay writers and producers, if they show promise. Okay?Four stars in this instance means this was an unpredictable, original, thought-provoking film that will please, though other reviewers are correct in saying it doesn't show much nudity. (Hey! that's not supposed to matter!) I like that none of the characters are stereotypes and all seem to be rather well-developed with their own distinct personalities.

There are flaws (some of the worse editing ever attempted, a musical score that is inappropriate at best, and some evidence of shortcuts in the flow of the story that are jarring), but for the most part this film has a rather sophisticated appearance.Conrad (Matt Walton) is an Ad Executive who has been deserted by his lover for being ""controlling"" and on a bored evening he decides to find sensual pleasure without emotional commitment via a hustler service, the hustler turning out to be one ""Tyler"" (Sean Matic whose actual name is Ian).  Conrad beds Tyler, finds an attraction, discovers through questioning that ""Tyler"" says he is a straight man, newly immigrated from Australia, who is forced into hustling as the only means available to him for making enough money to marry his girlfriend!  Conrad befriends him by giving him a job as an assistant to the photographer in his agency and there begin the problems of mistaken identities.  Conrad's art director Michael eventually falls for Ian and the truth about Ian's hustling background is made clear in a way that impacts all of the characters in the drama.The sensitivity in the film is the obvious need for people to be truthful in their relationships - at every level from acquaintance to commitment.  Each of the characters is shown to be needy, to have dark sides, and capable of change.  They are also likeable guys who just want to be happy.For a film about gay relationships 200 AMERICAN is a positive lesson.  Director LeMay tells his story with a minimum of on screen sexual acting out - to a degree that the animal appeal of the characters is minimized and that harms the film.  But with solid actors with good screen presence and a script that for the most part minimizes cliches, this is a film worth watching.

What is the endless fascination? Frankly, I'm sick of them. This movie did nothing to break out of the gay hustler cliche.The acting is acceptable and the actors pretty to look at but the dialog is unbelievably bad. (""Hello! One Life to Live called. They want their dialog back."") I admit that I did chuckle at the stuck elevator scene. Sad that some seemingly talented actors couldn't have been given some better dialog.The plot has no real story arc or climax, in fact seems to change focus halfway through the film.The characterizations are sloppy. Even some of the minor characters such as Ted and Emily and the foul-mouthed models are as likable and funny as fingernails on a chalkboard. Ian is pretty well-developed but the screenwriter doesn't seem to know where he's going with Conrad. Is Conrad a jerk? Are we supposed to feel sympathy toward him because of his recent breakup? He comes across as petty and vindictive (the blanket incident described in the elevator) and that's a dangerous position to place a major character in. In any storyline, if you have an unlikeable character as a lead and you want to engage your audience, you'd better make sure s/he has some redeeming quality.And Conrad has none. Maybe LeMay doesn't want to engage his audience.The character of the grandfather was one of the few bright spots in the film.In the end, the movie never really answers the question posed in its tagline: ""What are you worth?""

It doesn't rely on fancy production and lighting or cinematography. Most of the actors are straight playing gay roles. I was surprised to learn from the special features material that the entire cast and crew volunteer for this show, something that I can certainly relate to. The acting is acceptable but not great, because most of the actors are not that experienced. I was surprised that there was no production and wardrobe designer! The movie has some kind of charm about it, perhaps it's because it's so sincere and gimmick free, and even the love scenes are very low-key. I was very touched by the romantic plotline between the hustler and his new boss. There is something about a straight guy doing love scene with another male actor, it's very captivating.
