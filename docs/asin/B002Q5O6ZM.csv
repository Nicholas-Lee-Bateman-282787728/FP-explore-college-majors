It started out with a general description of the greed and selfishness of stockbrokers during the 1920s which led (in part) to the crash of 1929. Then, when I thought the next episodes would focus mainly on the desperate climate of the depression, they focused on 1) the Community Conservation Core, 2) the Hoover Dam, 3) the dust bowl, and finally 4) Seabiscuit. Admittedly, there was some depressing moments  especially during the dust bowl episode, but overall the episodes touched on very determined people who sacrificed themselves by building and re-shaping parts of the country that were overworked and destroyed primarily because of ignorance. I would recommend this to people that do not have a through understanding of events during the 1930s and to people who may want to rejuvenate their hopes that people are capable of incredible feats when they put their minds to it even during these trying times.",5,Good history lesson,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,1027,"['Really', 'good', 'history', 'lesson', 'regarding', 'positive', 'actions', 'taken', 'place', 'depression', '1930s', 'started', 'out', 'general', 'description', 'greed', 'selfishness', 'stockbrokers', '1920s', 'led', 'part', 'crash', '1929', 'Then', 'when', 'thought', 'next', 'episodes', 'would', 'focus', 'mainly', 'desperate', 'climate', 'depression', 'focused', '1', 'Community', 'Conservation', 'Core', '2', 'Hoover', 'Dam', '3', 'dust', 'bowl', 'finally', '4', 'Seabiscuit', 'Admittedly', 'was', 'depressing', 'moments', 'especially', 'dust', 'bowl', 'episode', 'episodes', 'touched', 'very', 'determined', 'people', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'building', 're-shaping', 'parts', 'country', 'were', 'overworked', 'destroyed', 'primarily', 'ignorance', 'would', 'recommend', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'understanding', 'events', '1930s', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'want', 'rejuvenate', 'hopes', 'people', 'are', 'capable', 'incredible', 'feats', 'when', 'put', 'minds', 'even', 'trying', 'times']",N/A
