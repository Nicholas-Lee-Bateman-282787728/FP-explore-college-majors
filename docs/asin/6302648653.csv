L'hoir,"[3, 3]","In watching this riveting British series, I was constantly reminded of John Steinbeck's magnificent image in ""The Moon is Down"" of the ""feathered steel spindles [that] came whistling down and roared to splinters."" However, ""Danger UXB"" relates the account of the many bombs that whistled down on London and its environs, but either remained silent or ticked away ominously until they could be diffused by army engineers who were true heroes during the blitz and afterwards. Too often the dud bombs ""roared into splinters"" killing the men whose average term of service was measured by weeks rather than months.When I purchased this series, I confess, I had reservations about how many ways that the writers could make bomb disposal interesting in a dozen episodes. My doubts were almost immediately dispelled though, for the technical details were among the most fascinating aspects of the series. For me, the most breath-searing episode was the one called ""Butterfly Winter"" which focused on what I suppose was the WWII equivalent of carpet bombs, designed to kill civilians. With historical hindsight, in fact, one realizes that the cunning lengths to which the Nazis went to make ""ordinary"" bombs lethal to the men diffusing them were only preludes for worse to come, with the doodlebugs, V-2, and the even more evil rocket horrors that were for wartime Britain thankfully thwarted, but for the future of the world, merely postponed.One of the things that British filmmakers do best is to develop their characters, and one must acknowledge the fine direction of an ensemble cast led by a young Anthony Andrews as Lieutenant Bryan Ash. The viewer really comes to care about every one of the men in the unit, including young Corporal Horrocks, the crusty sergeant, and the epitome of aristocratic public school good sportsmanship, Ivor (Jeremy Sinden), who deservedly becomes head of the group.Although I thought that Judy Geeson was miscast in the role of Ash's love-interest (She seemed much older than Andrews.) and that the music was awfully 1979, I wasn't bothered enough to let it spoil the series, which is not in the least bit dated.This excellent series, which lauds the courage of the British people during the blitz, is guaranteed to hold one's interest from its window-shattering beginning to its explosive end.",5,"""Feathered Steel Spindles""",1197331200,"12 11, 2007",2007,2323,"['watching', 'riveting', 'British', 'series', 'was', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'magnificent', 'image', 'Moon', 'Down', 'feathered', 'steel', 'spindles', '[', ']', 'came', 'whistling', 'down', 'roared', 'splinters', 'However', 'Danger', 'UXB', 'account', 'many', 'bombs', 'whistled', 'down', 'London', 'environs', 'either', 'remained', 'silent', 'ticked', 'away', 'ominously', 'could', 'be', 'diffused', 'army', 'engineers', 'who', 'were', 'true', 'heroes', 'blitz', 'afterwards', 'Too', 'often', 'dud', 'roared', 'splinters', 'killing', 'men', 'average', 'term', 'service', 'was', 'measured', 'weeks', 'rather', 'months.When', 'purchased', 'series', 'confess', 'had', 'reservations', 'how', 'many', 'ways', 'writers', 'could', 'make', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'interesting', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'doubts', 'were', 'almost', 'immediately', 'dispelled', 'technical', 'details', 'were', 'most', 'fascinating', 'aspects', 'series', 'most', 'breath-searing', 'episode', 'was', 'one', 'called', 'Butterfly', 'Winter', 'focused', 'what', 'suppose', 'was', 'WWII', 'equivalent', 'carpet', 'bombs', 'designed', 'kill', 'civilians', 'historical', 'hindsight', 'fact', 'one', 'cunning', 'lengths', 'Nazis', 'went', 'make', 'ordinary', 'bombs', 'lethal', 'men', 'diffusing', 'were', 'only', 'preludes', 'worse', 'come', 'doodlebugs', 'V-2', 'even', 'more', 'evil', 'rocket', 'horrors', 'were', 'wartime', 'Britain', 'thankfully', 'thwarted', 'future', 'world', 'merely', 'postponed.One', 'things', 'British', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'best', 'develop', 'characters', 'one', 'must', 'acknowledge', 'fine', 'direction', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'led', 'young', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'Lieutenant', 'Bryan', 'Ash', 'viewer', 'really', 'care', 'one', 'men', 'unit', 'including', 'young', 'Corporal', 'Horrocks', 'crusty', 'sergeant', 'epitome', 'aristocratic', 'public', 'school', 'good', 'sportsmanship', 'Ivor', 'Jeremy', 'Sinden', 'who', 'deservedly', 'head', 'group.Although', 'thought', 'Judy', 'Geeson', 'was', 'miscast', 'role', 'Ash', 'love-interest', 'seemed', 'much', 'older', 'Andrews', 'music', 'was', 'awfully', '1979', 'was', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'enough', 'let', 'spoil', 'series', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'dated.This', 'excellent', 'series', 'courage', 'British', 'people', 'blitz', 'guaranteed', 'hold', 'one', 'interest', 'window-shattering', 'beginning', 'explosive', 'end']",N/A

I didn't know much about bomb disposal, and although I knew about the blitz I didn't realize until I saw this series how dreadful it must have been to live through.When I watched the videos recently, I found out I have become a wimp.  I just couldn't take the stress and anxiety, had to leave the room a few times until my husband said it was safe to come back.So, this is fair warning - if you can't take suspense, don't watch this.  Otherwise very interesting, although Brian Ashe gets a little annoying by the end of the series.  However, the actor who played the role is great, Anthony Andrews, and he went on to play Sebastian in Brideshead revisited.

Shirley,"[8, 8]","I can add little to the superlative reviews here in terms of plot summary or overall evaluation: the individual episodes stand on their own, and the suspense is indeed nerve wracking. I do want to mention a few things about the cast. Anthony Andrews is, of course, superb, exhibiting as Lt. Ash the growth one would expect in a green officer as he becomes an expert at bomb disposal. Ken Kitson is excellent as Corporal Horrocks. The late Jeremy Sinden is superb (and thin) as the toffy, cynical, and kind-hearted Lt. Ivor Rogers. Judy Geeson, as always, is wonderful and beautiful. But the two performances that stay with me are George Innes as the conniving Wilkins and the brilliant Maurice Roves as the always correct, entirely competent, and fatherly Sergeant Baines. For those two performances alone, this series is worth buying, watching, and re-watching. As is usually the case with a BBC series, the cast is entirely too small to imitate war-time London, but it doesn't matter, because the stories, the sets, and the characters are so compelling.

325750,AFFP5R0FJXJIK,6302648653,Michael  Ziegler,"[28, 28]","In 1979, Public Television launched this important look at another set of heroes during the London blitz days of 1940. Much outside of the ordinary, this chilling, tension filled drama unravels with characters from a bomb disposal unit who constantly risked their lives in a learn -as -you- go approach to unexploded bombs. This story follows one unit headed by Lt. Ash,( Anthony Andrews) from his innocent first arrival during the confusion of pre-invasion days to his becoming a veteran of defusing live ordinance.Perhaps the most fascinating feature is the constant introduction of new inventions in order to assist UXB men in their trade. Characters come in and out in dramatic fashion, blowing up attempting to dismantle a type 17 (booby trap) bomb or by fate. We begin to believe that perhaps nothing is going to happen to Lt. Ash until &quot;The Pier&quot; episode is shown, where he becomes the victim of friendly fire. I should mention that all of the stuff that happens beyond Ash receiving the letter from his girfriend ending the relationship is created fiction beyond what Hartley had written in the book. It (the book) being rather short, the screenplay writers developed the characters admirably further on into the war and we are all the better for it. A tremendous series, one of the best ever and is in urgent need of DVD development. Watching this program through to completion will leave you with a feeling that you will never view things in the same way ever again.

The story is told through a fictional bomb disposal squad commanded by a young engineering student turned lieutenant, Brian Ash.Fascinating story and technical details when they stick to the actual bomb disposal material, but the personal stories are so much cliched fluff--the main one is that Ash falls in love with the daughter of a scientist working on the bomb disposal effort.  They are temporarily blocked by the fact that she already has a husband who is also doing an important job--he is one of the codebreakers at Bletchley Park working on the Enigma secret.  But not to worry--hubby obligingly kills himself so the lovers can get together with a clear conscience.  As the Church lady would say ""How convenient!""Also the one extra is nothing much, a documentary from the History Channel, not on the British bomb disposal effort during the War, but just a general piece on bomb disposal in general.In conclusion,  if you like realistic war stories, buy it, but use the fast forward whenever Judy Geeson says ""Oh, Brian!""",4,Great war story but skip the soap opera.,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,1241,"['One', 'great', 'period', 'pieces', 'Brits', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'story', 'British', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'squads', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'done', 'John', 'Hawkesworth', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'produced', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'story', 'told', 'fictional', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'squad', 'commanded', 'young', 'engineering', 'student', 'turned', 'lieutenant', 'Brian', 'Ash.Fascinating', 'story', 'technical', 'details', 'when', 'stick', 'actual', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'material', 'personal', 'stories', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'cliched', 'fluff', 'main', 'one', 'Ash', 'love', 'daughter', 'scientist', 'working', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'effort', 'are', 'temporarily', 'blocked', 'fact', 'already', 'husband', 'who', 'also', 'doing', 'important', 'job', 'one', 'codebreakers', 'Bletchley', 'Park', 'working', 'Enigma', 'secret', 'not', 'worry', 'hubby', 'obligingly', 'lovers', 'can', 'get', 'together', 'clear', 'conscience', 'Church', 'lady', 'would', 'say', 'How', 'convenient', 'Also', 'one', 'extra', 'nothing', 'much', 'documentary', 'History', 'Channel', 'not', 'British', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'effort', 'War', 'just', 'general', 'piece', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'general.In', 'conclusion', 'like', 'realistic', 'war', 'stories', 'buy', 'use', 'fast', 'forward', 'whenever', 'Judy', 'Geeson', 'Oh', 'Brian']",N/A

The suspense is palpable during the actual bomb disarming sequences. Plenty of neat details on the process, and a lot of good character development as well. Another reviewer noted a somewhat soap opera quality to the included love story and while that is a point, it does serve to develop the characters more so that you care what happens to them. That said, those aspects of the show do run a bit long especially in later episodes. I also think that the 'feel' of the show changed in the last few episodes with less cohesion among the main characters, something which is a bit of a let-down.

I must fall into that catergory of people who first saw it then and have not seen it since.  Still its one of those works that holds up well over the years.  The acting is superb all around.  The story draws you into the characters and the times they lived in during the Blitz in 1940.  Few productions give you this kind of qaulity production anymore.  Sure there aren't the fancy special effects stuff of today because this is a story for adult viewers, not grown-up kids wanting just a lot of noise instead of decent plot and character development.Americans don't know what its like to have all their major cities bombed as happened to the British during the Battle of Britain in 1940, commonly known as the Blitz over there.  To see this series you get some idea what daily life might have been like.  Of course the Germans would get it much worse when the Royal Air Force and US 8th Air Force returned the favor to Germany just a few years later.  Yes, there is a lot of none action in this series, which endeavors to show what life was like in that unique period for Britain.  The romance between Ash and Susan is a prime example, but it is not annoying like so many obligatory romances in these kinds of stories generally are.Everything in this series is realistic and believeable. Even the filler is interesting because it sheds light on the way people lived then.  The DVD edition would have benefited a bit by having a sub-title option because the varied accents and numerous Britishisms make the dialouge difficult to follow at times.  This is a very British production in that sense, and US viewers not familier with the lingo might have a tough time.  As they say, the UK and US are two countries seperated by a common language!  This series certainly shows that!The DVD extra feature about bomb disposal was not much of an addition.  The show hardly touches on the WW2 period in the UK, and spends most of its time with the NYPD bomb squad! You couldn't find something almost more non-related than this, even though in theory there is a connection.  I guess the A & E people had nothing else on this topic to drop in.  Too bad the BBC were not consulted for something more appropriate.  Even with these two minor issues the series still deserves 5 stars and will richly reward the viewer every time.

Even after several viewings I still find the suspense gripping and the  sorrows harrowing;  this is a series that wears well.Admittedly the  casting and writing lean on timeless British social stereotypes;  we have  (of course) the hot-tempered, whingeing, nervous Welshman;  the  shady-entrepreneurial Cockney with little courage but a kindly heart;  the  upright Geordie, the stoic and efficient Midlands farmer, and so on...  right down to the tarty wannabe-middle-class landlady's daughter, the  dithering Vicar, the petty shopkeeper, the nicely horsy County aunt.  Stereotypes all, yet somehow in this case loving stereotypes, a warm  tribute to traditional Britishness and the way of life that the War ended  for good -- celebrated here in the very moment of its destruction.  Whether  it's a video transfer problem or an intentional mannerism, the VHS copy has  a warm sepia tone that (for me) subtly underscores the nostalgia.The  acting is first rate throughout, with the possible exception of Judy Geeson  who seems sometimes a bit disconnected from her own dialogue.  She improves  with time, however, and rises to understated tragedy near the end.  But the  show is stolen by the men of Ash's company:  their nattering, grumbling,  quarrelsome, inspired dialogue and ensemble acting is what makes this a  lasting gem.  Splendid character parts come and go;  there is scarcely a  throwaway line or a background character in the whole show.Highly  recommended for anyone who loves to watch good actors at their best, or  whose interest in the history of war goes beyond John Wayne in US  propaganda flicks.

Pretty much the series is about a young officer who ends up in the 'bomb disposal' unit much to his chagrin. Anthony Andrews plays a really smart, charming and engaging character. About halfway through the series he strikes up a relationship with a married woman which was a tad boring and disappointing. Not a big fan of adultury in my fiction, especially without really good extenuating circumstances.Still, the story was engaging and the evolution of Andrew's character from naive officer to experienced veteran was interesting to watch.

325758,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,6302648653,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[35, 35]","The setting is England, 1940.  A young, newly-commissioned officer arrives at his headquarters.  Whatever he may be expecting, it is not to find out that his first appointment is heading up a bomb disposal unit.  It is an assignment in which the life expectancy is ten weeks, and the disposal men die at a rate of one per day.  When Lieutenant Brian Ash (played superbly by Anthony Andrews (Brideshead Revisited)) realizes that there has been no mistake and that, with no previous knowledge, training or understanding of bombs or bomb defusal, he is to take charge of one of the units, the look on his face is worth a thousand words.  I for one certainly felt a shiver go down my spine.  You see, as the officer in charge, it will be Ash's duty to physically disable the bombs.  The rest of the unit--the sappers, as they're called--are there to do the digging and wood-framing around the bombs so that the officer in charge can access them and so that they can be lifted out and carted away for detonation once they're disarmed.Produced and written (for the most part) by John Hawkesworth, who is most famous for having brought us both Upstairs Downstairs and The Duchess of Duke Street, Danger UXB is a 1979 production and is an absolutely superb period drama--every bit as good as his two better-known offerings and sure to be enjoyed by those who've enjoyed either of those series.  This series, which consists of thirteen 50-minute episodes, revolves around Ash and his unit as they fight the neverending battle of getting rid of unexploded bombs.  The Germans actually used to drop bombs that were designed to remain intact upon impact, often until such time as they were tampered with or until a certain amount of time had passed.  The British were initially unprepared for such a tactic, and with no instruction manuals, they had little choice but to learn about the types of bombs and how best to defuse them through observation and experimentation and with the aid of a lot of luck.  To make matters worse, the Germans kept redesigning the bombs in order to thwart the efforts of the defusers.  As a point of interest, over 20,000 UXBs were moved by disposal units during the war.DVD extras:  A 45-minute ""History Channel"" documentary (an American production) about modern-day bomb disposal units which includes interviews with the men who do the job wherein they share their experiences and reasons for choosing such a high-risk occupation.  One nice thing about this DVD set is that the four discs come in extra-skinny cases (half as thick as the usual cases), which makes it much more compact for storage!In conclusion, this is an intelligently written, superbly acted British suspense-drama (indeed, the suspense is almost unbearable at times!), and the information about the types of bombs and how they work is accurate and informative--so informative that when the series was broadcast in England, a viewer apparently realized that one of his child's toys was in fact a butterfly bomb!  This is a series which will of course be of immense interest to fans of the war genre, but the appeal is broad enough that I would highly recommend it to fans of period productions in general or to anyone looking for a good suspense drama.  Personally, I debated getting it, as I don't really care for war shows, but I'm glad I took a chance on it, as it's as much about relationships and individuals as it is about the dramatic and suspenseful war-time jobs the men do.  With a little of something for everyone, this was a show that both the men and the women in our family thoroughly enjoyed.Extremely highly recommended!",5,Rivetting World War II Suspense Drama!,1118102400,"06 7, 2005",2005,3626,"['setting', 'England', '1940', 'young', 'newly-commissioned', 'officer', 'headquarters', 'may', 'be', 'expecting', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'first', 'appointment', 'heading', 'up', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'unit', 'assignment', 'life', 'expectancy', 'ten', 'weeks', 'disposal', 'men', 'die', 'rate', 'one', 'day', 'When', 'Lieutenant', 'Brian', 'Ash', 'played', 'superbly', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'been', 'mistake', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'training', 'understanding', 'bombs', 'bomb', 'defusal', 'take', 'charge', 'one', 'units', 'look', 'face', 'thousand', 'words', 'one', 'certainly', 'felt', 'shiver', 'go', 'down', 'spine', 'see', 'officer', 'charge', 'will', 'be', 'Ash', 'duty', 'physically', 'disable', 'bombs', 'rest', 'unit', 'sappers', ""'re"", 'called', 'are', 'there', 'do', 'digging', 'wood-framing', 'bombs', 'officer', 'charge', 'can', 'access', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'lifted', 'out', 'carted', 'away', 'detonation', 'once', ""'re"", 'disarmed.Produced', 'written', 'most', 'part', 'John', 'Hawkesworth', 'who', 'most', 'famous', 'having', 'brought', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'Duchess', 'Duke', 'Street', 'Danger', 'UXB', '1979', 'production', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'period', 'drama', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'two', 'better-known', 'offerings', 'sure', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'who', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'series', 'series', 'thirteen', '50-minute', 'episodes', 'Ash', 'unit', 'fight', 'neverending', 'battle', 'getting', 'rid', 'unexploded', 'bombs', 'Germans', 'actually', 'used', 'drop', 'bombs', 'were', 'designed', 'remain', 'intact', 'impact', 'often', 'such', 'time', 'were', 'tampered', 'certain', 'amount', 'time', 'had', 'passed', 'British', 'were', 'initially', 'unprepared', 'such', 'tactic', 'instruction', 'manuals', 'had', 'little', 'choice', 'learn', 'types', 'bombs', 'how', 'best', 'defuse', 'observation', 'experimentation', 'aid', 'lot', 'luck', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Germans', 'kept', 'redesigning', 'bombs', 'order', 'thwart', 'efforts', 'defusers', 'point', 'interest', '20,000', 'UXBs', 'were', 'moved', 'disposal', 'units', 'war.DVD', 'extras', '45-minute', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'American', 'production', 'modern-day', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'units', 'interviews', 'men', 'who', 'do', 'job', 'wherein', 'share', 'experiences', 'reasons', 'choosing', 'such', 'high-risk', 'occupation', 'One', 'nice', 'thing', 'DVD', 'set', 'four', 'discs', 'come', 'extra-skinny', 'cases', 'half', 'as', 'thick', 'usual', 'cases', 'much', 'more', 'compact', 'storage', 'conclusion', 'intelligently', 'written', 'superbly', 'acted', 'British', 'suspense-drama', 'indeed', 'suspense', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'times', 'information', 'types', 'bombs', 'how', 'work', 'accurate', 'informative', 'so', 'informative', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'broadcast', 'England', 'viewer', 'apparently', 'realized', 'one', 'child', 'toys', 'was', 'fact', 'butterfly', 'bomb', 'series', 'will', 'course', 'be', 'immense', 'interest', 'fans', 'war', 'genre', 'appeal', 'broad', 'enough', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'period', 'productions', 'general', 'anyone', 'looking', 'good', 'suspense', 'drama', 'Personally', 'debated', 'getting', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'war', 'shows', ""'m"", 'glad', 'took', 'chance', 'as', 'much', 'relationships', 'individuals', 'dramatic', 'suspenseful', 'war-time', 'jobs', 'men', 'do', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', 'was', 'show', 'men', 'women', 'family', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed.Extremely', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
