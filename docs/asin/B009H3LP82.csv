I know you had to suspend belief for much of what happened on the island but I was OK with that.  It is a tv movie after all.  I liked how they showed the differences in Emma and Dean's personalities.  She is more practical, goal oriented, have a plan, organized, worrier, social butterfly.  He is more carefree (with those he cares about), aloof with others, naturally positive thinker.  He reminds me of my cocker spaniel.  That dog loves me and my other dog Juli.  He tolerates other dogs but isn't really interested in playing with them at the dog park or day care.  He pretty much ignores them because he only wants to be with Juli.  To me, Dean was like that.  I think he enjoyed being on that island with Emma, just living free.  He was interested in her before and on the island he had her all to himself.  I think after they returned to the world, he just wanted to be with her- no welcome back parties, no prom.  She played the waffling teen girl role well.  She got back to her life and tried to recapture what she had before, without him.  I could see a teenage girl being like that (Oh, he's not so popular, we never hung out before we were on the island, he's kind of an outsider, and we're not on the island anymore, and I'm kind of liking being the popular center of attention right now, but I care about him, but what would everyone else say, he's cute and we did stuff on the island and now I'm confused).

At the end, when the girl Emma with whom he shared his life for 4 months stranded on the island returns to her family and friends and  apparently backs away from/rejects Dean, the hurt and depression Brenton Thwaites shows as Dean is awesome....thtoally believable.  One can actually feel the hurt and rejection coming from hm.  That's a sign of a good actor.  No wonder he now is in Maleficent, The Signal, The Giver, Ride, etc. (all in one year).

1596642,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009H3LP82,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[24, 27]","Admit it, you were clamoring for a new interpretation of ""The Blue Lagoon!"" The 1980 original with Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins is probably more notorious than it is actually good, but that's okay. It tapped into a primal innocence and a fascination with sexual awakening that seems to have connected with viewers over time. In many ways, I think that revisiting this topic might be a good idea. A modern telling might bring a bit more frankness to the table. If, however, you are going to modernize a tale this reliant on sexual themes--the Lifetime network probably isn't the best bet to make the subject compelling or believable. ""Blue Lagoon: The Awakening,"" thus, plays more like a chaste opposites-attract teen picture with a dash of Swiss Family Robinson style survival thrown in. Nothing of consequence is really at stake and the conclusion is never in doubt.Indiana Evans plays a privileged teen beauty queen who happens to just fall off a boat. We won't discuss the specifics, you've simply got to see it to believe it! Luckily, high school slacker Brenton Thwaites is on hand to keep her company. Fortuitously, he is equipped with a surprising number of survival skills so that the two of them can make the best of a bad situation. Stranded for two months, the pair who have little in common start to grow closer. Will they find true love? Can they survive a wild animal attack? Will Thwaites ever show signs of facial hair? Everything is so by the numbers, I guess you will already know the answers to these questions. The kids are likable enough, the screenplay just doesn't give them much to do other than to act rather silly. When the climatic scene arrives, it lacks any impact. It's like the movie just ran out of time, so they slapped a conclusion on. If that wasn't bad enough, though, we now return (very unnecessarily) to high school for an even bigger anticlimax.This being Lifetime, though, I did enjoy some of the more fascinating bad movie moments. Denise Richards plays Evans' mother in a series of odd choices. After poorly executing a terrible emotional outpouring, she then remains somewhat disconnected from the realities of the situation. The screenplay, once again, doesn't have the ambition to try to dig into actual emotion. But ""Blue Lagoon: The Awakening"" doesn't have particularly lofty goals and that saves it somewhat. It is a bit of lightweight escapism. As it never feels remotely real, there is corny fun to be had in the watching. While it's easy enough to appreciate some of the movie's silliness, I'd best recommend that you catch this for free on TV when you have the chance as opposed to purchasing the DVD!

Otherwise, it would have been even better if Brooke Shields had made a lightening quick appearance in this movie.  I am glad that Atkins has a sense of humor about his past and doesn't make a big deal out of his former teen idol status, in fact it's kind of sweet that he takes the time out to appear in just such things that share the names.  But those are the only two good (or one good and one potentially good) point I can give for this movie.  Otherwise, this is some teen drama that uses the title of Blue Lagoon which really doesn't have much to do with the original save for a few cosmetic features.The two teens (gorgeous and nubile) are on a class trip to Trinidad when they get separated from their group and end up stranded on a desert island together.  While the whole time I was betting that they were actually on the empty side of the island and they would find a Holiday Inn complete with pool and bar on the other side, this is predictable and kind of annoying.  They are, naturally, from different crowds in their high schools and have a resentment towards one another.  Then when the days start to drift by they realize they have to put that angst aside and work together in order to survive.  And then they do what comes naturally.  Denise Richards as the gal's MOM?  Well, she is a mother in real life who could, possibly, be Em's mother in real life, but she comes off as far too bitchy and stiff to be liked at all.As I said, the only positive about this is Christopher Atkins's appearance to give those who remember a little smile.",2,Did you see him!?!?,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,1672,"['give', 'two', 'stars', 'Christopher', 'Atkins', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'surprise', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'Otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'had', 'made', 'lightening', 'quick', 'appearance', 'movie', 'am', 'glad', 'Atkins', 'sense', 'humor', 'past', ""n't"", 'make', 'big', 'deal', 'former', 'teen', 'idol', 'status', 'fact', 'kind', 'sweet', 'time', 'out', 'appear', 'just', 'such', 'things', 'share', 'names', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'good', 'one', 'good', 'one', 'potentially', 'good', 'point', 'can', 'give', 'movie', 'Otherwise', 'teen', 'drama', 'title', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'original', 'save', 'few', 'cosmetic', 'features.The', 'two', 'teens', 'gorgeous', 'nubile', 'are', 'class', 'trip', 'Trinidad', 'when', 'get', 'separated', 'group', 'end', 'up', 'stranded', 'desert', 'island', 'together', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'betting', 'were', 'actually', 'empty', 'side', 'island', 'would', 'find', 'Holiday', 'Inn', 'complete', 'pool', 'bar', 'other', 'side', 'predictable', 'kind', 'annoying', 'are', 'naturally', 'different', 'crowds', 'high', 'schools', 'have', 'resentment', 'one', 'Then', 'when', 'days', 'start', 'drift', 'realize', 'have', 'put', 'angst', 'aside', 'work', 'together', 'order', 'survive', 'then', 'do', 'what', 'naturally', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'gal', 'MOM', 'Well', 'mother', 'real', 'life', 'who', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'Em', 'mother', 'real', 'life', 'off', 'far', 'too', 'bitchy', 'stiff', 'be', 'liked', 'all.As', 'said', 'only', 'positive', 'Christopher', 'Atkins', 'appearance', 'give', 'who', 'remember', 'little', 'smile']",Blue Lagoon: The Awakening

Arblaster ""Eclectic Collector""","[7, 12]","Granted this is definitely not one of the best made-for-television movies that I have seen but it is a lot better than the one made decades ago with Brooke Shields in it.  Unlike that one this movie actually has a plot.It is about 2 teenagers from 2 different groups in high school who are attracted to one another but never speak.  Emma is super organized and never questions anything.  Dean is a loner who is left alone by his father more often than not.  Both are fairly nice people.  Then, of course, they trapped on an island together.  While on the island they fall in love.  Dean opens up to Emma and begins to get over his mother's death.  Emma learns to loosen up and to take things as they come.  Both teenagers mature a great deal.  Once they get rescued Emma is uncertain of how to deal with home.  She and Dean sort of go back to being the way they were before, but they can't change the fact that they've both grown up or that they still have feelings for one another.  Emma goes to prom and takes her little over-looked sister as her date.  Dean, with his father's encouragement, shows up.  Dean stands out in the rain.  Emma comes out and they get back together and end up having their first dance at home in the rain.The acting is not so bad.  The setting is beautiful.  All in all this is not a bad film.

It's all pretty much PG to maybe PG-13.This movie is everything you expect it to be. There are two young people stranded on the island, old news. They fall in love, have sex, and do the whole survival thing - way old news. The sex isn't where you see it, but after they're done.If you seen the other movies, then there's nothing really new about this one that is a must. You can either watch it or not and it won't matter because everything is too predictable in the whole movie. Sometimes it gets kind of irritating to watch the two on the screen because it all just seems too stupid to watch.What's the difference from this and the other two movies?Spoilers below.----------------------------------Spoilers below.Well this time, it's more of a modern movie and the setting is in the year 2010s. These two young couple have parents and when the kids get lost, the parents keep on looking for them during the movie. There's no one on the island but those two lovers. There's not even natives on the island. There are no visitors that goes to the island - until they are rescue. When they do return home, the two slowly learn to live in society again, but the two don't exactly know how they feel about each other yet. But, at the end, of course, they fall in love with each other again.If you want to watch this predictable and nothing worth wild to see movie go right ahead.",2,Plot is overused to death!,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,1441,"['Let', 'say', 'first', 'violence', 'nudity', 'bad', 'words', 'pretty', 'much', 'PG', 'maybe', 'PG-13.This', 'movie', 'everything', 'expect', 'be', 'are', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'stranded', 'island', 'old', 'news', 'fall', 'love', 'have', 'sex', 'do', 'whole', 'survival', 'thing', 'way', 'old', 'news', 'sex', ""n't"", 'where', 'see', ""'re"", 'done.If', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'then', 'nothing', 'really', 'new', 'one', 'must', 'can', 'either', 'watch', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'everything', 'too', 'predictable', 'whole', 'movie', 'kind', 'irritating', 'watch', 'two', 'screen', 'just', 'too', 'stupid', 'watch.What', 'difference', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'Spoilers', 'below.', 'Spoilers', 'below.Well', 'time', 'more', 'modern', 'movie', 'setting', 'year', '2010s', 'two', 'young', 'couple', 'have', 'parents', 'when', 'kids', 'get', 'lost', 'parents', 'keep', 'looking', 'movie', 'one', 'island', 'two', 'lovers', 'not', 'even', 'island', 'are', 'visitors', 'island', 'are', 'rescue', 'When', 'do', 'return', 'home', 'two', 'slowly', 'learn', 'live', 'society', 'again', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'know', 'how', 'feel', 'other', 'yet', 'end', 'course', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'again.If', 'want', 'watch', 'predictable', 'nothing', 'worth', 'wild', 'see', 'movie', 'go', 'right', 'ahead']",Blue Lagoon: The Awakening
