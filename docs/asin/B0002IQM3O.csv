836304,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B0002IQM3O,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[2, 2]","This is a mature Merle Haggard and his band performing at their best, and in an excellent environment. Merle & his band are really ""into it"" and so is the large crowd at Billy Bobs, making this one great concert dvd. I've seen the dvd of Hag performing on Austin City Limits, and this one is a whole lot better. The only thing is that Merle does not play the fiddle any during this concert, he only plays his electric guitar. However, there is a good fiddle player in his band. He has a great backing band on this dvd.As far as I am aware of, this is the Hag's most recent dvd. I recently saw Merle Haggard & his band, in person, on the first night of his 2012 tour. This was in Monroe, Louisiana, back in January. They were selling this dvd at the concert, but, I waited and purchased mine from amazon, because it was a lot cheaper. After Hag left Monroe, and continued on his tour to Macon, Georgia, he became ill, and had to cancel about 10 of his concerts. He has recovered, and is now back on tour.As far as the song list goes, it is covered by the 1st reviewer, a.k.a. the most helpful review. Overall, this is definitely a 5 star quality concert dvd. It even contains bonus material, including an interview with the Hag.",5,"Merle Haggard & Band at Their Best - Live at Billy Bobs (Fort Worth, TX - The Biggest Honky Tonk in the World!!!!",1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,1227,"['mature', 'Merle', 'Haggard', 'band', 'performing', 'best', 'excellent', 'environment', 'Merle', 'band', 'are', 'really', 'so', 'large', 'crowd', 'Billy', 'Bobs', 'making', 'one', 'great', 'concert', 'dvd', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dvd', 'Hag', 'performing', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'one', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'only', 'thing', 'Merle', 'not', 'play', 'fiddle', 'concert', 'only', 'electric', 'guitar', 'However', 'good', 'fiddle', 'player', 'band', 'great', 'backing', 'band', 'dvd.As', 'far', 'am', 'aware', 'Hag', 'most', 'recent', 'dvd', 'recently', 'saw', 'Merle', 'Haggard', 'band', 'person', 'first', 'night', '2012', 'tour', 'was', 'Monroe', 'Louisiana', 'back', 'January', 'were', 'selling', 'dvd', 'concert', 'waited', 'purchased', 'mine', 'amazon', 'was', 'lot', 'cheaper', 'Hag', 'left', 'Monroe', 'continued', 'tour', 'Macon', 'Georgia', 'became', 'ill', 'had', 'cancel', '10', 'concerts', 'recovered', 'now', 'back', 'tour.As', 'far', 'song', 'list', 'covered', '1st', 'reviewer', 'a.k.a', 'most', 'helpful', 'review', 'Overall', 'definitely', '5', 'star', 'quality', 'concert', 'dvd', 'even', 'bonus', 'material', 'including', 'interview', 'Hag']",N/A

The sound quality is riveting as this tight band backs the Hag with the perfection of a NY symphony. I notice a few new faces in this group of Strangers. The new drummer is incredible, I would have liked to see a stronger lead guitar but hey, long time band leader Norm Hamlet has put another great bunch together here. The entrance of the beautiful and talented Janie Fricke singing back-up on a couple numbers was pure bonus. I watch this and all my concerts on a 65"" HDTV and this example has risen to the top of my pile. Better lighting would have produced better skin tones, but hey.....we must remnember we are at Live at Billy Bobs, not in a TV studio. The Hag will always be immortal especially with productions like this. Buy this one! You will truly enjoy.",5,Thanks!........
