The reality was quite diffrent:The clergy openly supported fascism, even asking Hitler and Mussolini for support and at the time were still apologetic about their Conquest of Latin America.I loved the Directors ""The Killing Fields"" ""The Mission ""as one of the best movies I've seen.I didn't expect to be led into such a movie fiasco, by an director iI used to keep in high esteem.Also the portrait of two protagonist characters, living  under such incredible human stress, failed to convince me about their actions in the film.The acting was shallow and the scenes loaded with klischees.Also if you are not familiar with the spanisch civil war, like most viewers will be, how could he possibly believe that such a complex and stirring conflict could be understood by an unsuspecting audience.Realistically, this is two movies. One about the writer and his father. One about Opus Dei. The two stories are related by the thinnest of threads and the relation doesn't actually need to be there at all.I think the story about father and son, Monolo and Robert, would have been worth pursuing in more depth. The reason behind their rift is only alluded to and not explored terribly well, and their spontaneous reconciliation at the end felt forced. Deus ex machina. Perhaps a bit literally.Meanwhile, the story about Josemaria Escriva -- I can't understand why Joffe didn't show him walking on water as he did just about everything else. I found that this felt like a really nice public relations piece for Opus Dei. I guess the Church and Joffe felt they'd taken enough hits from Dan Brown and needed some positive spin.-----Of what I write now, is in response to the negative feedback I seem to catch, therefore I like to clarify a few points, to enforce my opinion:First of all, this movie polarizes viewers, you either love it or hate it.I hate it, because i believe it is trying to rewrite history. I'm not gonna tolerate lies.I watched this movie with the hope, that it would reconcile the catholic church at the time of the spanish civil war.Like other very good movies have done:La Forja de un rebelde, LIBERTARIAS, LAND AND FREEDOM, Five Cartridges (F&uuml;nf Patronenh&uuml;lsen) (1965).And than there is another movie, that will be posted soon : Los jinetes de Alba, another movie about the spanish civil war, and the catholic church, from a spanish director.The spanish have produced quite a view movies and tv miniseries during the last few years, trying to reconcile this tragic period.The catholic church of spain was well behind in times that concerned women's rights. Intellectual spanish women felt marginalized and deeply discriminated under their clerical authorities.They deeply felt a war waged against them. The spanish republic changed all that in the 1936 election, and transported spain into the age of modern civil rights.When the spanish military, supported by the facist leader Mussolini, and the nazi leader Adolf Hitler, staged their coup de etat, the catholic church did not hesitate, to put their supportbehind the spanish fascist military, with their leader Franco. There are documents that the clergy did not even hesitate do go behind their call of duty, even took on arms against their flocks.Now, I wonder why the director of this film, gets away without mentioning any of this ?",1,Painful to watch,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,3525,"['movie', 'was', 'awefully', 'pretentious', 'full', 'historical', 'lies.Uncivilized', 'left', 'wing', 'unionists', 'barbaric', 'republican', 'troops', 'well', 'meaning', 'right', 'wing', 'military', 'clergy', 'floating', 'higher', 'sheres', 'give', 'break', 'reality', 'was', 'quite', 'diffrent', 'clergy', 'openly', 'supported', 'fascism', 'even', 'asking', 'Hitler', 'Mussolini', 'support', 'time', 'were', 'still', 'apologetic', 'Conquest', 'Latin', 'America.I', 'loved', 'Directors', 'Killing', 'Fields', 'Mission', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'led', 'such', 'movie', 'fiasco', 'director', 'iI', 'used', 'keep', 'high', 'esteem.Also', 'portrait', 'two', 'protagonist', 'characters', 'living', 'such', 'incredible', 'human', 'stress', 'failed', 'convince', 'actions', 'film.The', 'acting', 'was', 'shallow', 'scenes', 'loaded', 'klischees.Also', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'spanisch', 'civil', 'war', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'believe', 'complex', 'stirring', 'conflict', 'could', 'be', 'understood', 'unsuspecting', 'audience.Realistically', 'two', 'movies', 'One', 'writer', 'father', 'One', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'related', 'thinnest', 'threads', 'relation', ""n't"", 'actually', 'need', 'be', 'there', 'all.I', 'think', 'story', 'father', 'son', 'Monolo', 'Robert', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'pursuing', 'more', 'depth', 'reason', 'rift', 'only', 'alluded', 'not', 'explored', 'terribly', 'well', 'spontaneous', 'reconciliation', 'end', 'felt', 'forced', 'Deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'Perhaps', 'bit', 'literally.Meanwhile', 'story', 'Josemaria', 'Escriva', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Joffe', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'walking', 'water', 'did', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'found', 'felt', 'really', 'nice', 'public', 'relations', 'piece', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'guess', 'Church', 'Joffe', 'felt', ""'d"", 'taken', 'enough', 'hits', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'needed', 'positive', 'spin.', 'what', 'write', 'now', 'response', 'negative', 'feedback', 'seem', 'catch', 'therefore', 'like', 'clarify', 'few', 'points', 'enforce', 'opinion', 'First', 'all', 'movie', 'viewers', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'it.I', 'hate', 'i', 'believe', 'trying', 'rewrite', 'history', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'tolerate', 'lies.I', 'watched', 'movie', 'hope', 'would', 'reconcile', 'catholic', 'church', 'time', 'spanish', 'civil', 'other', 'very', 'good', 'movies', 'have', 'done', 'La', 'Forja', 'un', 'rebelde', 'LIBERTARIAS', 'LAND', 'AND', 'FREEDOM', 'Five', 'Cartridges', 'F', 'uuml', 'Patronenh', 'uuml', 'lsen', '1965', '.And', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'posted', 'soon', 'Los', 'de', 'Alba', 'movie', 'spanish', 'civil', 'war', 'catholic', 'church', 'spanish', 'director.The', 'spanish', 'have', 'produced', 'view', 'movies', 'tv', 'miniseries', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'tragic', 'period.The', 'catholic', 'church', 'spain', 'was', 'well', 'times', 'concerned', 'women', 'rights', 'Intellectual', 'spanish', 'women', 'felt', 'marginalized', 'deeply', 'discriminated', 'clerical', 'authorities.They', 'deeply', 'felt', 'war', 'waged', 'spanish', 'republic', 'changed', '1936', 'election', 'transported', 'spain', 'age', 'modern', 'civil', 'rights.When', 'spanish', 'military', 'supported', 'facist', 'leader', 'Mussolini', 'nazi', 'leader', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'staged', 'coup', 'etat', 'catholic', 'church', 'did', 'not', 'hesitate', 'put', 'supportbehind', 'spanish', 'fascist', 'military', 'leader', 'Franco', 'are', 'documents', 'clergy', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'hesitate', 'do', 'go', 'call', 'duty', 'even', 'took', 'arms', 'flocks.Now', 'wonder', 'why', 'director', 'film', 'away', 'mentioning']",N/A

1493467,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005LKHAB6,Grady Harp,"[10, 16]","THERE BE DRAGONS is a film based on the saying 'Here be dragons' - a phrase used to denote dangerous or unexplored territories, in imitation of the medieval practice of putting sea serpents and other mythological creatures in uncharted areas of maps. Why this exceptional film did not appeal to theater audiences is possibly due to the fact of the release of another, animated film with a similar title (How to Train Your Dragon), and perhaps the title lead audiences astray.  That would be unfortunate because this true background story about the canonization of Josemar&iacute;a Escriv&aacute; (9 January 1902 - 26 June 1975) - a Roman Catholic priest from Spain who founded Opus Dei, an organization of laypeople and priests dedicated to the teaching that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life is a path to sanctity. He was canonized in 2002 by Pope John Paul II, who declared Saint Josemar&iacute;a should be `counted among the great witnesses of Christianity'.Roland Joff&eacute; (`The Mission', `The Killing Fields', `The  Scarlet Letter', `Vatel' etc) wrote and directed this film that revisits the Spanish Civil War and the events leading up to that war, the confusion about communism, fascism, anarchy, and republic that divided a country for years. A young journalist Robert (Dougray Scott) long ago rejected by his now aged and dying father Manolo (Wes Bentley) finds himself investigating one of his father's former friends, Josemaria (Charlie Cox) who is a candidate for canonization. Uncovering the two men's complicated relationship from childhood through the horrors of the Spanish Civil War unveils a compelling drama filled with passion, betrayal, love and religion. An action packed story set during a murderous time in history that ultimately serves the present by revealing the importance and timeless power of forgiveness. Manolo and Josemaria were childhood friends who joined the seminary to become priests: Manolo gave up the priesthood to embrace the outside Spanish Civil War while Josemaria felt called by God to form the Opus Dei, protecting his people and challenging the forces of evil that battled outside the church. Manolo falls under the spell of a beautiful Hungarian girl Ildiko (Olga Kurylenko) who is a freedom fighter who in turn has fallen in love with a leader of the revolution Oriol (Rodrigo Santoro). While the three fight the battle Manolo becomes a mole and is ultimately responsible for the death of Oriol and Ildiko.  The secret that Robert, years later, is investigating as he writes a book about Josemaria reflects years of anguish that is resolved as Robert's father (Manolo) reveals the true history of his life on his deathbed.The writing for the film is shaky - there are many sidebars that are never explained and the conversations among the characters feel strained.  The actors are superb and do manage to bring to life palpable character.  Some fine supporting roles are well managed by Geraldine Chaplin, Jordi Moll&agrave;. Golshifteh Farahani, Derek Jacobi, Lily Cole, Unax Ugalde, Charles Dance, Ana Torrent and others.

I saw the ratings and decided to watch it.  A great movie about love and forgiveness.  The acting was first rate and I could sympathize with the characters.  Very enlightening about the civil war in Spain.  Behind it all is the friendship of the two main characters.  They took different paths and each had to fight the dragons within.  Very tragic story of one of the two friends.  One who was eventually canonized as a saint and the other that tried to redeem himself at the end of his life.  What I would have like was more of what happened to father Jose Maria after he escaped over the mountains to eventually found Opus Dei.

1493469,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005LKHAB6,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[4, 8]","I guess that I can't say a whole lot about this film, mostly because I turned it off after a little over an hour of waiting for something interesting to happen in this nearly unbearable snooze-fest of a film. It's understandable that there are quite a few people that were and continue to be inspired by the work of St. Josemaria Escriva and Opus Dei during the Spanish Civil War, but I felt that the message, however inspired, was lost in a mire of confusing narrative structure, uncertain motivations, and sketchy characterization. Roland Joffe used to be able to make great films in his sleep, with great and powerful films like THE MISSION and THE KILLING FIELDS, but after those films, he made the so-bad-it's-good adaptation of THE SCARLET LETTER with Demi Moore, GOODBYE, LOVER, which is a terrible attempt at steamy neo-noir, and the worst of the lot is his bizarre move into psychological torture horror with CAPTIVITY.I do have to say that the main reason that I decided to see this film was for Wes Bentley. Since he showed such promise and skill over a decade ago with his major film debut as Ricky Fitts in Sam Mendes' brilliant AMERICAN BEAUTY. Since then, though, plagued by poor career choices and serious struggles with addiction, I've been dying to see him in something good. But truly awful films like GHOST RIDER, P2, and JONAH HEX have done nothing to try to put him back into a career worthy of his talents. I was hoping that this would be a film where I would start to see a glimmer of the promise he showed back then. Sadly, this was not it.Firstly, I was confused why we had a bunch of British, American and Austrailian actors playing Spaniards. That's something that so often puzzles and bothers me. I know that the urge to anglicanize films about foreign lands is powerful from a potential box office appeal standpoint, but is so often unnecessary, primarily because every country in the world has great actors and performers that can speak the language and be as good (if not better) than any of the performers in most films, but also because the accents, more often than not, become far too distracting. At least they had room for Rodrigo Santoro in the film as Oriol. Charlie Cox is decent as Escriva, but the character seems far too... happy and confident for the explosive events erupting all around him. Even more lost is Bentley as Manolo Torres, who never really seems to find his footing, especially in the unbelievably bad ""old man"" makeup. For God's sakes, almost 30 years ago, someone was able to successfuly turn F. Murray Abraham into an incredibly convincing old man in 1984's AMADEUS, but they couldn't find someone who could do it now when people are creating zombies and werewolves and bizarre creatures at every FX shop in the world? Dougray Scott seems to be sleepwalking here. The only performance I was enjoying was that of Sir Derek Jacobi, and he had about six minutes of screentime.I know that I don't really have a whole lot to say that's a reasonable review of the entirety of this film, but my impression of THERE BE DRAGONS is the first act is so plodding and messy that I can't see how it might have improved.",2,This Film Be Draggin'...,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",2012,3166,"['guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'whole', 'lot', 'film', 'mostly', 'turned', 'off', 'little', 'hour', 'waiting', 'something', 'interesting', 'happen', 'nearly', 'unbearable', 'snooze-fest', 'film', 'understandable', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'were', 'continue', 'be', 'inspired', 'work', 'St.', 'Josemaria', 'Escriva', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'felt', 'message', 'however', 'inspired', 'was', 'lost', 'mire', 'confusing', 'narrative', 'structure', 'uncertain', 'motivations', 'sketchy', 'characterization', 'Roland', 'Joffe', 'used', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'great', 'films', 'sleep', 'great', 'powerful', 'films', 'MISSION', 'THE', 'KILLING', 'FIELDS', 'films', 'made', ""so-bad-it's-good"", 'adaptation', 'THE', 'SCARLET', 'LETTER', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'GOODBYE', 'LOVER', 'terrible', 'attempt', 'steamy', 'neo-noir', 'worst', 'lot', 'bizarre', 'move', 'psychological', 'torture', 'horror', 'CAPTIVITY.I', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'main', 'reason', 'decided', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'showed', 'such', 'promise', 'skill', 'decade', 'major', 'film', 'debut', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'brilliant', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'then', 'though', 'plagued', 'poor', 'career', 'choices', 'serious', 'struggles', 'addiction', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dying', 'see', 'something', 'good', 'truly', 'awful', 'films', 'GHOST', 'RIDER', 'P2', 'JONAH', 'HEX', 'have', 'done', 'nothing', 'try', 'put', 'back', 'career', 'worthy', 'talents', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'where', 'would', 'start', 'see', 'glimmer', 'promise', 'showed', 'back', 'then', 'Sadly', 'was', 'not', 'it.Firstly', 'was', 'confused', 'why', 'had', 'bunch', 'British', 'American', 'Austrailian', 'actors', 'playing', 'Spaniards', 'something', 'so', 'often', 'puzzles', 'bothers', 'know', 'urge', 'anglicanize', 'films', 'foreign', 'lands', 'powerful', 'potential', 'box', 'office', 'appeal', 'standpoint', 'so', 'often', 'unnecessary', 'primarily', 'country', 'world', 'great', 'actors', 'performers', 'can', 'speak', 'language', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'performers', 'most', 'films', 'also', 'accents', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'become', 'far', 'too', 'distracting', 'least', 'had', 'room', 'Rodrigo', 'Santoro', 'film', 'Oriol', 'Charlie', 'Cox', 'decent', 'Escriva', 'character', 'far', 'too', 'happy', 'confident', 'explosive', 'events', 'erupting', 'Even', 'more', 'lost', 'Bentley', 'Manolo', 'Torres', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'find', 'footing', 'especially', 'unbelievably', 'bad', 'old', 'man', 'makeup', 'God', 'sakes', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'someone', 'was', 'able', 'successfuly', 'turn', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'incredibly', 'convincing', 'old', 'man', '1984', 'AMADEUS', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'do', 'now', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'creating', 'zombies', 'werewolves', 'bizarre', 'creatures', 'FX', 'shop', 'world', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'be', 'sleepwalking', 'here', 'only', 'performance', 'was', 'enjoying', 'was', 'Sir', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'had', 'six', 'minutes', 'screentime.I', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'say', 'reasonable', 'review', 'entirety', 'film', 'impression', 'THERE', 'BE', 'DRAGONS', 'first', 'act', 'so', 'plodding', 'messy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'improved']",N/A

For me, the movie was hard to follow because three of the main characters that you see the most of, all look similar.  Each one having dark hair, dark eyes, familiar sounding voice, and after five facial hair.  Blame it on my eyes maybe.  The movie also takes several odd twists and turns and is told by two different people at very random times, which also contributed to me having such a hard time following the story.  And the story isnt real clear about how or when they decide to switch viewpoints.  The cinematography was nice, but the writing was not real put together, which gave it several instances of confusion.  Surprisingly, aside from a few of the actors, the acting was not real great either.  The movie, while supposedly being based on the Opus Dei, didn't explain or dig any deeper into it.  It was just mentioned a few times in passing.  Also, while the movie states that a man is researching a priest who has ties to his father, the two didn't really cross paths that much.  So it really doesn't seem to carry the movie as the sole storyline.What I did like about the movie, was just when I thought I knew what was going to happen or what did happen, I would find I wasn't right about it at all.  In that aspect it really did keep you guessing and wondering.  The end, although obvious once revealed, took me by surprise as well.  There was also a scene (possible *Spoiler Alert*) where a beautiful, glowing, young lady, discusses her disbelief and possibly the priests disbelief as well, for God.  She talks about ""Him"" not hearing their prayers and how its hard to believe in ""Him"" afterall.  I find this to be quite a comparison to the devil tempting the priest into turning away from God. It appears that this girl is a vision that comes to him in his depths of despair.*Parental Concerns*Its a war movie and so there is language.  I wouldn't consider this a kids movie anyway but for those who like to know.....There are several instances of language. B!**h, S*!t, A**, He**, Dam*, OMG.  A man & woman have a child out of wedlock. A man shoots himself and blood is seen.  Two seperate scenes where a man shoots another person. Of course lots of explosions, destruction, blood, and war scenes.*Spoiler Alert*For those that have seen this movie, perhaps you could explain something for me.

1493484,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LKHAB6,Mark Turner,"[27, 30]","Don't rent THERE BE DRAGONS thinking you'll be watching some dungeons and dragons item. It has nothing to do with fantasy worlds or actual dragons.The movie is the true story of Josemaria Escriva, founder of Opus Dei. This group may sound familiar to you as it was used in the Dan Brown book/movie THE DAVINCI CODE. But it seems that truth is more interesting than fiction as we find out what it was all about. Also don't think this movie is a boring recitation of religious ideology, far from it.Taking place in Spain Dougray Scott plays a journalist looking into the life of Escriva for an article he's writing. When his father, Judge Manolo, learns of this, he calls for him and provides him with information Scott never realized he had. It seems that his father and Escriva grew up together in the same small town in Spain.The two began as boyhood chums but financial ruin made Escriva's family a pariah to that of Manolo. Later they have a run in at the seminary they both attend but make amends. Their lives then take to very different paths that one would think would never cross again. Instead, their lives cross at moments more important than anyone might ever know.Manolo (Wes Bentley) works with his father's company and takes on the attitude of royalty when it comes to his workers. While many are complaining and threatening strikes, influenced by the Communists viewpoints becoming popular, he continues to see himself as the person in charge who can do as he wishes. Things change with time and the factory closes but he retains his wealth and position. Manolo eventually offers his services to the military who have tried to take over the country, going undercover with the subversives who want to have Communist rule.At the same time Escriva (Charlie Cox) has become a priest, but one without enlightenment it seems. When he asks for direction from God, he receives it and then approaches his superiors with the idea he feels God sent to him. It is this idea that begins the formation of the group known as Opus Dei. But rather than be depicted as fanatical murderers we are presented with an order that follows the guidelines of everyday people uniting to worship and to follow God's word through their daily lives. Each person involved follows the same rules that priests would follow without being ordained. Escriva believes that in this way all can become closer to God.The problem with Escriva though is one that involves the church during the Spanish Civil War that is going on around them. The subversives want nothing to do with the Catholic Church, going so far as to kill priests in the streets. Escriva's group must meet behind closed doors, worshipping but not openly.While this is going on Manolo has infiltrated the subversives. He routinely sends information via radio to the military which disrupts much of which these fighters set out to accomplish. While undercover he also falls in love with one of the female fighter who wants nothing to do with him. She shares herself with the leaders and most fierce fighters, but holds back from Manolo. It just makes her more alluring to him.These two divergent paths must cross at some time and they do. But not before we witness the reality of who these two men really are, the acts they perform for their different beliefs and how their world changes around them.Director Roland Joffe has been connected with movies that take on the ideas of God and man in many forms, most notable with THE MISSION and THE KILLING FIELDS. Here he once again provides an outsiders view, a look that neither encourages nor dissuades the beliefs of the viewer. Instead we have an open minded look at a topic that is rather touchy for most.As I said at the start, the movie might sound stuffy if all you heard about was Opus Dei and the Spanish Civil War. But after watching it made me more interested in both topics. You'll find yourself surfing the web looking for info on both or seeking out reading material. And the movie itself will hold your interest from start to finish. Well made, well directed and well acted, it should have been and Oscar contender. My guess is when the subject matter of God came into play it was unofficially disqualified. Their loss perhaps but your gain should you decide to watch.",4,TOUCHED BY GOD,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,4272,"['Do', ""n't"", 'rent', 'THERE', 'BE', 'DRAGONS', 'thinking', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'dungeons', 'dragons', 'item', 'nothing', 'do', 'fantasy', 'worlds', 'actual', 'dragons.The', 'movie', 'true', 'story', 'Josemaria', 'Escriva', 'founder', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'group', 'may', 'sound', 'familiar', 'was', 'used', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'book/movie', 'THE', 'DAVINCI', 'CODE', 'truth', 'more', 'interesting', 'fiction', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'boring', 'recitation', 'religious', 'ideology', 'far', 'it.Taking', 'place', 'Spain', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'journalist', 'looking', 'life', 'Escriva', 'article', 'writing', 'When', 'father', 'Judge', 'Manolo', 'information', 'Scott', 'never', 'realized', 'had', 'father', 'Escriva', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'same', 'small', 'town', 'Spain.The', 'two', 'began', 'boyhood', 'chums', 'financial', 'ruin', 'made', 'Escriva', 'family', 'pariah', 'Manolo', 'Later', 'have', 'run', 'seminary', 'attend', 'make', 'amends', 'lives', 'then', 'take', 'very', 'different', 'paths', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'never', 'cross', 'again', 'Instead', 'lives', 'cross', 'moments', 'more', 'important', 'anyone', 'might', 'ever', 'know.Manolo', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'father', 'company', 'attitude', 'royalty', 'when', 'workers', 'many', 'are', 'complaining', 'threatening', 'strikes', 'influenced', 'Communists', 'viewpoints', 'becoming', 'popular', 'see', 'person', 'charge', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'Things', 'change', 'time', 'factory', 'closes', 'wealth', 'position', 'Manolo', 'eventually', 'services', 'military', 'who', 'have', 'tried', 'take', 'over', 'country', 'going', 'undercover', 'subversives', 'who', 'want', 'have', 'Communist', 'rule.At', 'same', 'time', 'Escriva', 'Charlie', 'Cox', 'become', 'priest', 'one', 'enlightenment', 'When', 'direction', 'God', 'then', 'superiors', 'idea', 'God', 'sent', 'idea', 'formation', 'group', 'known', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'rather', 'be', 'depicted', 'fanatical', 'murderers', 'are', 'presented', 'order', 'guidelines', 'everyday', 'people', 'uniting', 'worship', 'follow', 'God', 'word', 'daily', 'lives', 'person', 'involved', 'same', 'rules', 'priests', 'would', 'follow', 'being', 'ordained', 'Escriva', 'way', 'can', 'become', 'closer', 'God.The', 'problem', 'Escriva', 'one', 'church', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'going', 'subversives', 'want', 'nothing', 'do', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'kill', 'priests', 'streets', 'Escriva', 'group', 'must', 'meet', 'closed', 'doors', 'worshipping', 'not', 'going', 'Manolo', 'infiltrated', 'subversives', 'routinely', 'information', 'radio', 'military', 'disrupts', 'much', 'fighters', 'set', 'out', 'accomplish', 'undercover', 'also', 'love', 'one', 'female', 'fighter', 'who', 'nothing', 'do', 'shares', 'leaders', 'most', 'fierce', 'fighters', 'back', 'Manolo', 'just', 'more', 'alluring', 'him.These', 'two', 'divergent', 'paths', 'must', 'cross', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'witness', 'reality', 'who', 'two', 'men', 'really', 'are', 'acts', 'perform', 'different', 'beliefs', 'how', 'world', 'changes', 'them.Director', 'Roland', 'Joffe', 'been', 'connected', 'movies', 'take', 'ideas', 'God', 'man', 'many', 'forms', 'most', 'notable', 'MISSION', 'THE', 'KILLING', 'FIELDS', 'Here', 'once', 'again', 'outsiders', 'view', 'look', 'encourages', 'beliefs', 'viewer', 'Instead', 'have', 'open', 'minded', 'look', 'topic', 'rather', 'touchy', 'most.As', 'said', 'start', 'movie', 'might', 'sound', 'stuffy', 'heard', 'was', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'watching', 'made', 'more', 'interested', 'topics', ""'ll"", 'find', 'surfing', 'web', 'looking', 'info', 'seeking', 'out', 'reading', 'material', 'movie', 'will', 'hold', 'interest', 'start', 'finish', 'Well', 'made', 'well', 'directed', 'well', 'acted', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'guess', 'when', 'subject', 'matter', 'God', 'came', 'play', 'was', 'unofficially', 'disqualified', 'loss', 'perhaps', 'gain', 'should', 'decide', 'watch']",N/A

The story begins with Robert, a journalist, (Dougray Scott) being asked to investigate the life of Jose Maria Escriva (Charlie Cox), as he is about to be Canonised. He discovers that his estranged father went to the same seminary as him and so uses it as an excuse to reconnect with his dying patriarch.The story then starts to be told in flash back and we start around 1911 when the two boys were friends. It turns out that his father knows a lot more than most and all of their lives are sort of intertwined. The real story takes place during The Spanish Civil War (1936 -39) where Manolo (Roberts dad played by Wes Bentley) gets involved with both sides in the fighting.The story of the War is told in tandem with that of Jose Maria as he becomes the modern founder of Opus Dei and does charitable works and faces many threats; being a Priest he is particularly susceptible to summary execution at the hands of the Republicans/Communists/Socialists/Anarchists or what ever you want to call the legitimate Government.This is written and directed by Roland Joffe (`The Mission' and `The Killing Fields') and had a fairly big budget that was actually quite well spent. The battle scenes are effective, with good CGI where it is used. The direction is excellent and the acting is all above par. But the narrative drives this and as ever there are some stretches of belief required a couple of times. To say any more would be a plot spoiler. It is also just over two hours long, but it does not feel like a long film and I thought it ended quite quickly as I was up for more. So despite the flaws this is really rather good as entertainment. Despite the subject matter this is all in English, although there are attempts at Spanish accents. There are a couple of cameos from Charles Dance and Derek Jacobi too.This is not be Joffe's best film but is far from being a bad one. If you are an historically accurate fan there will be things to take issue with, and indeed has stirred up quite a few emotion so much so I have revised my star rating to reflect that for some the historical holes are just too much of a deal breaker.",3,`Every saint has a Past and Every sinner has a Future',1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,2308,"['film', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'such', 'quite', 'lot', 'poetic', 'licence', 'out', 'probably', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'especially', 'aspect', 'Church', 'involvement', 'story', 'Robert', 'journalist', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'being', 'asked', 'investigate', 'life', 'Jose', 'Maria', 'Escriva', 'Charlie', 'Cox', 'be', 'Canonised', 'estranged', 'father', 'went', 'same', 'seminary', 'so', 'excuse', 'reconnect', 'dying', 'patriarch.The', 'story', 'then', 'be', 'told', 'flash', 'back', 'start', '1911', 'when', 'two', 'boys', 'were', 'friends', 'out', 'father', 'lot', 'more', 'most', 'lives', 'are', 'sort', 'intertwined', 'real', 'story', 'place', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', '1936', '-39', 'where', 'Manolo', 'Roberts', 'dad', 'played', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'involved', 'sides', 'fighting.The', 'story', 'War', 'told', 'tandem', 'Jose', 'Maria', 'modern', 'founder', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'charitable', 'works', 'many', 'threats', 'being', 'Priest', 'particularly', 'susceptible', 'summary', 'execution', 'hands', 'Republicans/Communists/Socialists/Anarchists', 'what', 'ever', 'want', 'call', 'legitimate', 'Government.This', 'written', 'directed', 'Roland', 'Joffe', 'Mission', 'Killing', 'Fields', 'had', 'fairly', 'big', 'budget', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'well', 'spent', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'effective', 'good', 'CGI', 'where', 'used', 'direction', 'excellent', 'acting', 'par', 'narrative', 'drives', 'ever', 'are', 'stretches', 'belief', 'required', 'couple', 'times', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'also', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'not', 'feel', 'long', 'film', 'thought', 'ended', 'quite', 'quickly', 'was', 'up', 'more', 'flaws', 'really', 'rather', 'good', 'entertainment', 'subject', 'matter', 'English', 'are', 'attempts', 'Spanish', 'accents', 'are', 'couple', 'cameos', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'too.This', 'not', 'be', 'Joffe', 'best', 'film', 'far', 'being', 'bad', 'one', 'are', 'historically', 'accurate', 'fan', 'will', 'be', 'things', 'take', 'issue', 'indeed', 'stirred', 'up', 'quite', 'few', 'emotion', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'revised', 'star', 'rating', 'reflect', 'historical', 'holes', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'deal', 'breaker']",N/A
