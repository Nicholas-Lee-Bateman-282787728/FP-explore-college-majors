Then I heard about Mobsters and Mormons. I saw the preview and I thought, ""Alright, I'll give this one a try."" I didn't see it until it came out in DVD and I've never been so entertained in a movie in all of my life! The comedy in here was so funny, I had a serious side-ache by the time the movie ended.It has this tough mobster who is in hiding with his family in the good ol' State Utah. And all he wants in the world is to be left alone and have a decent cup of coffee. But alas, nothing really happens that way. Aside from the unique humor about this movie, I loved the message it was getting across about 'true love and friendship'. I was raised in this fashion and it's a good feeling when people out there are finally recognizing what Christ's love is *really* about. The ending made me smile because it left with a feeling that the mobster and his family are settled and happy where they are emotionally and spiritually.This is a definate for LDS and non-LDS members alike! :)",5,The Quality in LDS-Made Movies are Improving!,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,1099,"['When', 'saw', 'first', 'LDS-made', 'comedy', 'movie', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'swore', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'as', 'long', 'lived', 'Then', 'heard', 'Mobsters', 'Mormons', 'saw', 'preview', 'thought', 'Alright', ""'ll"", 'give', 'one', 'try', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'so', 'entertained', 'movie', 'life', 'comedy', 'here', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'had', 'serious', 'side-ache', 'time', 'movie', 'ended.It', 'tough', 'mobster', 'who', 'hiding', 'family', 'good', 'ol', 'State', 'Utah', 'world', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'have', 'decent', 'cup', 'coffee', 'alas', 'nothing', 'really', 'way', 'Aside', 'unique', 'humor', 'movie', 'loved', 'message', 'was', 'getting', 'love', 'friendship', 'was', 'raised', 'fashion', 'good', 'feeling', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'finally', 'recognizing', 'what', 'Christ', 'love', '*really*', 'ending', 'made', 'smile', 'left', 'feeling', 'mobster', 'family', 'are', 'settled', 'happy', 'where', 'are', 'emotionally', 'spiritually.This', 'definate', 'LDS', 'non-LDS', 'members', 'alike']",Mobsters and Mormons

962344,A2K7TFL2ITQWUU,B000CSNCI2,"K. Gray ""kennypop702""","[0, 2]","This movie is a somewhat enjoyable film geared towards members of the LDS faith. It has a few funny moments that and it is pretty well acted (for lower budget movies at least).The movies premise is about a Mobster who cuts a deal with the FBI (to stay out of jail) and squeels on his mob boss in return for his squeeling he and his family are put into a witness protection program and are sent to live in Provo, Utah.The movies premise is what it's like for a hard core mobster and his family to live in happy valley.Like I said this movie does have a few good laughs and the acting is good (for a low budget film).The problem with the film are as follows:1 - Too preachy... sometimes the film tries too hard to preach about the LDS faith instead of tell a story2 - On my DVD copy the sound didn't match the movement on people's lips. I would think that would be something you should check out before you start producing the film!3 - Just an average good one time watch.... nothing you would want to see over and over again. This would be a good one time rental or library movie.Decent just not great.",3,Easy to watch and enjoy but by no means great,1158105600,"09 13, 2006",2006,1101,"['movie', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'geared', 'towards', 'members', 'LDS', 'faith', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'pretty', 'well', 'acted', 'lower', 'budget', 'movies', 'least', '.The', 'movies', 'premise', 'Mobster', 'who', 'deal', 'FBI', 'stay', 'jail', 'squeels', 'mob', 'boss', 'return', 'squeeling', 'family', 'are', 'put', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'are', 'sent', 'live', 'Provo', 'Utah.The', 'movies', 'premise', 'what', 'hard', 'core', 'mobster', 'family', 'live', 'happy', 'valley.Like', 'said', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'acting', 'good', 'low', 'budget', 'film', '.The', 'problem', 'film', 'are', 'follows:1', 'Too', 'preachy', 'sometimes', 'film', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'preach', 'LDS', 'faith', 'instead', 'tell', 'story2', 'DVD', 'copy', 'sound', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'movement', 'people', 'lips', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'start', 'producing', 'film', '3', 'Just', 'average', 'good', 'one', 'time', 'watch', 'nothing', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'time', 'rental', 'library', 'movie.Decent', 'just', 'not', 'great']",Mobsters and Mormons
