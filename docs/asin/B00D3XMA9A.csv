1653580,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00D3XMA9A,Jon Wynne,"[1, 2]","The Battle of Westerplatte was the first battle of World War II during the Nazi invasion of Poland. Though doomed from the start, the 200 soldiers garrisoned at Westerplatte held out for seven days, thus serving to inspire a nation as a symbol of resistance. In the process of enduring a naval bombardment, assault troops and dive bombers, the defenders of Westerplatte kept well over 3,000 German troops busy, buying time for other parts of Poland to prepare their defenses. The fact they didn&#8217;t stand a chance only served to reinforce, in the eyes of Poland and the rest of the free world, how vital it was to stand up to Hitler.It&#8217;s great subject matter for a film, and writer/director Pawel Chochelew has come up with a winner for the most part, even managing to inject some truly artful moments into what could easily have been just another World War II film. The problem is the special effects mostly, and the staging of the battle scenes, in part. Let&#8217;s face it, audiences are more sophisticated about CGI effects these days , so if you&#8217;re going to use them, they have to be well done. The above-mentioned dive bombers are a particularly good example of bad special effects.In Poland, the title of the film is slightly different, translating as THE SECRET OF WESTERPLATTE. Apparently the secret is that the men defending Westerplatte were actually commanded by Second in Command Capt Dabrowski, and not by Major Sucharski. While this is of only passing interest to audiences simply looking for a good war movie, it does aid the human interaction during the siege.Apparently Major Sucharski had some sort of mental breakdown during the battle, which paved the way for Capt Dabrowski&#8217;s taking over command. The scenes depicting Sucharski&#8217;s breakdown (here interpreted as epilepsy) are very well done and the director manages to find a way to bring something fresh to the war movie genre. Interesting as this is, the poor special effects and sometimes ineptly shot battle scenes (the German soldiers&#8217; frontal beach assault looks ridiculous) undermine these efforts at originality.In the end, one&#8217;s enjoyment of 1939 BATTLE OF WESTERPLATTE will be determined by what is more valued: interesting human interaction or battle scenes.",3,Good but flawed account of battle.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,2281,"['Battle', 'Westerplatte', 'was', 'first', 'battle', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Nazi', 'invasion', 'Poland', 'Though', 'doomed', 'start', '200', 'soldiers', 'garrisoned', 'Westerplatte', 'held', 'out', 'seven', 'days', 'thus', 'serving', 'inspire', 'nation', 'symbol', 'resistance', 'process', 'enduring', 'naval', 'bombardment', 'assault', 'troops', 'dive', 'bombers', 'defenders', 'Westerplatte', 'kept', 'well', '3,000', 'German', 'troops', 'busy', 'buying', 'time', 'other', 'parts', 'Poland', 'prepare', 'defenses', 'fact', 'didn', '8217', 'stand', 'chance', 'only', 'served', 'reinforce', 'eyes', 'Poland', 'rest', 'free', 'world', 'how', 'vital', 'was', 'stand', 'up', 'Hitler.It', '8217', 'great', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Pawel', 'Chochelew', 'come', 'up', 'winner', 'most', 'part', 'even', 'managing', 'inject', 'truly', 'artful', 'moments', 'what', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'film', 'problem', 'special', 'effects', 'mostly', 'staging', 'battle', 'scenes', 'part', 'Let', '8217', 'face', 'audiences', 'are', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'CGI', 'effects', 'days', 'so', '8217', 're', 'going', 'use', 'have', 'be', 'well', 'done', 'above-mentioned', 'dive', 'bombers', 'are', 'particularly', 'good', 'example', 'bad', 'special', 'effects.In', 'Poland', 'title', 'film', 'slightly', 'different', 'translating', 'THE', 'SECRET', 'OF', 'WESTERPLATTE', 'Apparently', 'secret', 'men', 'defending', 'Westerplatte', 'were', 'actually', 'commanded', 'Second', 'Command', 'Capt', 'Dabrowski', 'not', 'Major', 'Sucharski', 'only', 'passing', 'interest', 'audiences', 'simply', 'looking', 'good', 'war', 'movie', 'aid', 'human', 'interaction', 'siege.Apparently', 'Major', 'Sucharski', 'had', 'sort', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'battle', 'paved', 'way', 'Capt', 'Dabrowski', '8217', 'taking', 'over', 'command', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'Sucharski', '8217', 'breakdown', 'here', 'interpreted', 'epilepsy', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'director', 'find', 'way', 'bring', 'something', 'fresh', 'war', 'movie', 'genre', 'Interesting', 'poor', 'special', 'effects', 'sometimes', 'ineptly', 'shot', 'battle', 'scenes', 'German', 'soldiers', '8217', 'frontal', 'beach', 'assault', 'ridiculous', 'undermine', 'efforts', 'end', 'one', '8217', 's', 'enjoyment', '1939', 'BATTLE', 'OF', 'WESTERPLATTE', 'will', 'be', 'determined', 'what', 'more', 'valued', 'interesting', 'human', 'interaction', 'battle', 'scenes']",N/A

The story of the start of WWII and the Poles being attacked by Germany certainly is compelling as a staring point, but I had to fast forward theu sections of this film I disliked most of it so much. First; the battle scenes are rather poor. Their is a lot of ""Poles fire 3 rounds--5 Germans fall down"" kind of action which is not compelling. Then the main story line of two contrasting leaders of the Polish defense constantly at odds with each other could have been great but...the one leader is totally brave & gung ho, and the other has severe shell shock or some other condition and is disappearing from leading his men just when they need him most over & over.

1653583,A2BOXYJTA14TTL,B00D3XMA9A,"M. Best ""Zackariah""","[2, 4]","This show looked promising.  I had never heard of this battle, or even Westerplatte prior to seeing the trailer.  So I jumped at the opportunity to see the show.  After seeing the first moments of the presentation, I realized that this was the story of the very important port town on the Baltic sea at the tip of the Danzig Corridor which had been contentious for years.  So I knew immediately that the Nazis were focused upon acquiring this strategic possession as soon as possible in the late thirties.  The stage for this theatre of conflict had been carefully prepared early in Hitler's script.Fortunately, the insight of Poland's plight during this century is common knowledge.  We all are aware of the Non-aggression pact, (Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement) signed in August of '39, and how it essentially created a demarcation line through the middle of Poland prior to the German invasion on September 01.Then that was followed by a Soviet grab of the eastern half of the country a few weeks later.  We know that Stalin had been somewhat worried about the overall intent of the Reich's intentions toward his domain for a number of years prior to the signing.  Stalin had directed his foreign minister to relay guarantees to the German's leadership of soviet support in the event that Deutschland was ever to be threatened.  Stalin was reassured by acquiring this new buffer zone that when added to his later conquest of the Finnish lands; increased his &#34;comfort level&#34; of territory between the obviously imperial designs by the Nazi leadership.  We also know that Poland's unenviable geographical position of being between Germany and the Soviet Union, was the root of much suffering during the first half of the twentieth century.We knew that Stalin was nothing more than a paranoid thug who probably couldn't even spell the word &#34;Communism.&#34;  Any true socialistic movements died with Lenin in 1924, and with the determined eradication of the remaining members of the Central Committee in the years that followed Lenin's demise, and the ice pick assassination of Leon Trotsky in Mexico City during this pivotal year of 1939.Also, Goebbels, Himmler, Hitler, and the rest of the German sadists were never in any doubt as to the eventual disposition of the soviet domain of the Ukraine, Belarus, the Caucasus, and the three Baltic states. These areas were always intended as &#34;Living Space&#34; for the Germanic peoples.  Poland's destiny was never in any doubt as being earmarked in this same manner by Hitler.  This is the Basic information that allows the viewer to understand the setting of this movie.These two maniacal leaders were just ruthless, killers seeking more power.  The conflicting dogmas of Fascism, and Communism probably never seriously crossed the minds of Stalin & Hitler.  They simply pursued the quickest path possible in all territorial acquisitional endeavors.I saw the show as essentially being a portrait of Polish Nationalism and the integrity of it's military force, and people.  The Polish are, and were a great people with unique perspective's.  They were determined to fight the Germans in 1939! This unheralded conflict for control of this critical harbor town as descripted in this presentation is a good indication of how this moment in time probably occurred.But, as a movie being watched now; &#34;The Battle of Westerplatte&#34; will flat put you to sleep after about thirty minutes!  I held on thinking it would get better, and even straightened up in my chair when the German battleships started firing upon the fortress. But, the thing was very predictable with few surprises other than the obvious determination of the Polish soldiers to not surrender regardless of the hope of success.The movie is was obviously made using a foreign language, but has an English language option.  But little effort is made to sync the English words to the German speakers.  Also, the available English subtitles do not match the actual audible English words that you hear.  It's a bit like watching those Japanese Godzilla movies that were made in the late sixties - the actor's mouth barely moves, yet entire sentences are heard!

1653584,A3MRHUNU5P67D,B00D3XMA9A,Muscovite,"[4, 9]","I expected a movie about the defense of Westerplatte, but what I watched was an interpretation of morality. Does anyone really know what the soldiers who were defending Westerplatte were thinking as the battle progressed? I am not sure that the historic value of the battle is adequately addressed by this movie. There is always the intent of the director to consider when critiquing a movie, so if the intent of the director was to have a morality play then his goal was achieved. If his intent was a historic account of the value of the battle then I believe the movie is a failure.....From a technical perspective; the overvoicing was BAD, and the language translation was not good.....Furthermore, why does a war movie need an interpretation of morality? War is in its self immoral. How can a soldier fighting to survive be expected to consider the moral implications of his dutiful actions? There is certainly a line that a soldier should never cross, such as was crossed by the Germans when they pillaged and plundered, but true soldiers are moral beings whom are caught in the midst of war. Their only choices are to fight, die, or surrender. The battle of Westerplatte could have been a little more about the fight to survive and how that fight serves to defend a country. One thing this movie does do very well is demonstrate how surrendering before all arms are expended is as immoral an act as is war.",2,somewhat confusing and not well edited,1378598400,"09 8, 2013",2013,1412,"['expected', 'movie', 'defense', 'Westerplatte', 'what', 'watched', 'was', 'interpretation', 'morality', 'Does', 'anyone', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'defending', 'Westerplatte', 'were', 'thinking', 'battle', 'progressed', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'historic', 'value', 'battle', 'adequately', 'addressed', 'movie', 'always', 'intent', 'director', 'consider', 'when', 'critiquing', 'movie', 'so', 'intent', 'director', 'was', 'have', 'morality', 'play', 'then', 'goal', 'was', 'achieved', 'intent', 'was', 'historic', 'account', 'value', 'battle', 'then', 'believe', 'movie', 'failure', 'technical', 'perspective', 'overvoicing', 'was', 'BAD', 'language', 'translation', 'was', 'not', 'good', '..Furthermore', 'why', 'war', 'movie', 'need', 'interpretation', 'morality', 'War', 'self', 'immoral', 'How', 'can', 'soldier', 'fighting', 'survive', 'be', 'expected', 'consider', 'moral', 'implications', 'dutiful', 'actions', 'certainly', 'line', 'soldier', 'should', 'never', 'cross', 'such', 'was', 'crossed', 'Germans', 'when', 'pillaged', 'plundered', 'true', 'soldiers', 'are', 'moral', 'beings', 'whom', 'are', 'caught', 'midst', 'war', 'only', 'choices', 'are', 'fight', 'die', 'surrender', 'battle', 'Westerplatte', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'fight', 'survive', 'how', 'fight', 'serves', 'defend', 'country', 'One', 'thing', 'movie', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'surrendering', 'arms', 'are', 'expended', 'immoral', 'act', 'war']",N/A

If one views war as periods of boredom punctuated by brief periods of fighting, then this film nails it.  While the film does focus on the emotional aspect of war and the often conflicting roles of duty,responsibility, and reality in such situations, there is too much time spent on silent brooding faces.That said, it is still worth watching from the historic aspect.

Millions more around the world claim full or part Polish decent.  Yet very little is known of its history.  Surprisingly few even know that the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 marked the beginning of WW11.The German blitzkrieg invasion gave no quarter.  The Soviets also joined their then German allies by invading the hapless country from the East.  The French and the British only declared war on Germany but did nothing to aid the Poles, who fought for over a month before capitulating, but never formally surrendering.  Poland kept up the fight by having in place the biggest resistance army in occupied Europe.  Many of its men and women formed the free Polish forces that fought alongside the British in almost all theatres of the European war.  From 1943 they also formed the Free Polish 1st and 2nd Polish armies that fought alongside the Soviets, and participated in the attack on Berlin in 1945.The movie Westerplatte is dubbed and, therefore, should be more accessible to a broader English speaking audience. Those expecting a huge big budget action film along the lines of the epic Battle for Warsaw 1920, as directed by the Polish director Jerzy Hoffman, would be disappointed as the action is interspersed with a storyline about the men involved in this struggle.  But then again not all war films need to be 90% very graphic battle scenes like the well made Russian WW11 film ""Fortress"", although this particular film does have its fair share of action sequences.The film presents as a well told story of Polish troops, based on a Baltic Sea peninsular near the Free City of Gdansk, holding out much longer than the required six hours against repeated German infantry attacks, heavy artillery and the bombardment by the German Navy's Holstein and the superior German Air Force.  Instead of six hours they held out for days and the German infantry losses were high.  The film depicts the battle scenes and the psychological conflicts endured by the men, particularly their commanding officer portrayed by Zebrowski.  There is also a struggle between him and his second in charge, who wanted to fight to the death.It is, overall, a well made movie depicting a WW11 story that deserves to be told, and shown to an audience interested in the lesser known stories of WWII.  I highly recommend it as a story of soldiers cut off from the rest of the world and fighting against an enemy with the upper hand in being able to attack from land, sea and air.PSI understand that an earlier Polish film about the Battle for Westerplatte was made decades ago - 1959, I believe, but is as yet not available on DVD to my knowledge.

September 1st, 1939, the Polish city of Gdansk is an important port city that the German's are looking to take control of. Trying not to scare the entire country the army decides to send a small group of 600 soldiers against the Germans with only one goal, hold out for at least 12 hours. When it becomes clear that no support is coming for them and with dwindling supplies and medical aid they have to decide to fight till the last man falls or surrender. This is a true story of the first battle of WWII. This is not a terrible war movie at all and is worth seeing but it is pretty slow moving and the war scenes leave something to be desired.
