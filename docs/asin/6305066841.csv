445801,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6305066841,Bobby Underwood,"[10, 10]","Many classic films which have fallen into the public domain over the years are often unfairly dismissed. Such is the case with this little gem. ""Pot O' Gold"" is a fun and happy little film starring Jimmy Stewart and Paulette Goddard. Released through Mary Pickford's United Artist company, the two leads are members of two feuding families who fall for each other. The riff is over music and a piece of property Jimmy's music hating Uncle Charly (Charles Winninger) wants so he can expand the lucrative health food business he wants Jimmy to help run.When Jimmy becomes a hero to the McCorckles, especially Molly (Paulette Goddard), by means of an errantly thrown tomato, he has to hide the fact that he's a Haskel. Horace Heidt, whose band has been practicing at Molly's mom's house, much to Charly's frustration, figures out who Jimmy is and the two cook up a scheme to get Charly out of town and use his radio show as a platform for the band.Once Molly discovers the truth, however, everything goes south when she announces a hefty cash sum will be given each week to get even for the ruse. Personal and legal chaos results, of course, and when Charly gets wind of what's going on live he hightails it back to the city.While this wasn't Stewart's favorite, it is bolstered by a charming atmosphere and pleasant tunes. One of those films which has weathered time, it is a fun distraction perfect for a lazy weekend. Proof that even lesser films of yesterday have more charm and entertainment value than most of what we see today.",5,A Charming Surprise,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,1531,"['Many', 'classic', 'films', 'have', 'fallen', 'public', 'domain', 'years', 'are', 'often', 'unfairly', 'dismissed', 'Such', 'case', 'little', 'gem', 'Pot', 'O', 'Gold', 'fun', 'happy', 'little', 'film', 'starring', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Paulette', 'Goddard', 'Released', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'United', 'Artist', 'company', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'members', 'two', 'feuding', 'families', 'who', 'fall', 'other', 'riff', 'music', 'piece', 'property', 'Jimmy', 'music', 'hating', 'Uncle', 'Charly', 'Charles', 'Winninger', 'can', 'expand', 'lucrative', 'health', 'food', 'business', 'Jimmy', 'help', 'run.When', 'Jimmy', 'hero', 'McCorckles', 'especially', 'Molly', 'Paulette', 'Goddard', 'means', 'errantly', 'thrown', 'tomato', 'hide', 'fact', 'Haskel', 'Horace', 'Heidt', 'band', 'been', 'practicing', 'Molly', 'mom', 'house', 'much', 'Charly', 'frustration', 'out', 'who', 'Jimmy', 'two', 'cook', 'up', 'scheme', 'get', 'Charly', 'town', 'use', 'radio', 'show', 'platform', 'band.Once', 'Molly', 'truth', 'however', 'everything', 'south', 'when', 'hefty', 'cash', 'sum', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'week', 'get', 'even', 'ruse', 'Personal', 'legal', 'chaos', 'results', 'course', 'when', 'Charly', 'wind', 'what', 'going', 'live', 'back', 'city.While', 'was', ""n't"", 'Stewart', 'favorite', 'bolstered', 'charming', 'atmosphere', 'pleasant', 'tunes', 'One', 'films', 'weathered', 'time', 'fun', 'distraction', 'perfect', 'lazy', 'weekend', 'even', 'lesser', 'films', 'yesterday', 'have', 'more', 'charm', 'entertainment', 'value', 'most', 'what', 'see', 'today']",N/A

It is a musical of sorts that features Jimmy Stewart as the nephew of a cold-hearted and disliked business man in town.  By a series of coincidences Jimmy Stewart becomes the one who hits his uncle in the face with a rotten tomato.  An event which makes him a hero to the MacCorkadales, but causes him to try and hide his true identity for a while.  It is hard to tell if it is really Jimmy Stewart who is playing the harmonica and singing, but it sure does look and sound like it is which is impressive.  Paulette Goddard as the daughter of Mrs. MacCorkadale is featured singing in a low voice which is nonetheless pleasing.  And her spirit throughout the film is charming.

All business people are evil and only artists know how to celebrate life. Violence, robbery, and deception of any kind is justified to teach the evil businessman a lesson.

Morris ""Corpsman""","[1, 1]","For some reason, ""Pot o' Gold"" hadn't come to my attention until now, and enjoyable as it is, it is not what I could have anticipated: a madcap, quasi-musical. I had to remind myself the movie was made just after the conclusion of America's more than three-and-a-half year participation in an arduous and exacting war. A heaping dose of escape and jollity was in order and this olio of almost believable nonsense must have been sweetened medicine to its audiences.""Pot o' Gold"" may be the only full length movie to come out of James Roosevelt's Globe Productions. James, the eldest son of Franklin D., was a Marine Corps hero and something of a co-founder of the O.S.S under ""Wild"" Bill Donovan; he cut his teeth in films working for Samuel Goldwyn as a vice president of productions. In 1939, and concurrent with his work at Goldwyn, Roosevelt founded Globe and began to produce short films. ""Pot o' Gold"" had been aired originally on radio before being turned into a full-length movie.In the late forties, if the American film industry had anything it had a cornucopia of magnificent supporting actors whose stage and screen experiences were solid. The cast of this zany romp runs like a mother's lode of pure silver from the top of the cast to the final billing.""Pot o' Gold"" was not made for the critics or for devotees of the fine arts; it's a nakedly tongue-in-cheek and brilliantly idiotic horsing around.

445811,A3EOYN87MMNHL1,6305066841,Phoebe Stogstill,"[4, 4]","This review is about, yes, A Big Band-Aid. A struggling Big Band needs help getting noticed and getting its big break. Jimmy Stewart (Jimmy) inherits his father's music store which is a hang-out for young, practicing, musicians. Jimmy plays a mean harmonica himself. His wealthy uncle who hosts a radio program called Harry's Happy Hour looks down his nose at the music store enterprise and offers to help Jimmy make it big if he will leave and join him. Harry hates all music and can't stand to even listen to it. Jimmy is forced to leave the foundering store and move into McCorkles' Boarding house. The beautiful McCorkle daughter (Paulette Goddard) is also the lead vocalist for the Big Band. When Jimmy and Uncle Harry both get thrown into the clinker through strange events, the uncle decides he needs to calm his nerves in Canada for a couple of weeks and leaves Jimmy in charge of his program. The whole group of musicians, Jimmy, and the McCorkles figure out a way to put the band on the air during the radio show and to even offer the listening audience a chance to win big money by spinning a wheel. The Band is a big success and gaining valuable sponsors for their air time, when Uncle Harry comes back from Canada, furious, as he did not want any music on his show. Uncle Harry has provided us with much slapstick comedy throughout the movie. The surprise in this movie (Jimmy S. is ALWAYS good) is the array of wonderful song and dance numbers and that Big Band sound. The song and dance routine in the jail cell, is very good. The ""Knife Fork and Spoon"" routine at the dining table in McCorkles' Boarding House is a work of genius, and the Rhumba numbers are glamour personified. After many spats between Jimmy and Miss McCorkle, love wins out and everyone is happy. A great movie made better by the song and dance extravaganza.",5,Big Band-Aid,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,1843,"['review', 'yes', 'Big', 'Band-Aid', 'A', 'struggling', 'Big', 'Band', 'help', 'getting', 'noticed', 'getting', 'big', 'break', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Jimmy', 'father', 'music', 'store', 'hang-out', 'young', 'practicing', 'musicians', 'Jimmy', 'mean', 'harmonica', 'wealthy', 'uncle', 'who', 'radio', 'program', 'called', 'Harry', 'Happy', 'Hour', 'down', 'nose', 'music', 'store', 'enterprise', 'help', 'Jimmy', 'make', 'big', 'will', 'leave', 'join', 'Harry', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'even', 'listen', 'Jimmy', 'forced', 'leave', 'foundering', 'store', 'move', 'McCorkles', 'Boarding', 'house', 'beautiful', 'McCorkle', 'daughter', 'Paulette', 'Goddard', 'also', 'lead', 'vocalist', 'Big', 'Band', 'When', 'Jimmy', 'Uncle', 'Harry', 'get', 'thrown', 'clinker', 'strange', 'events', 'uncle', 'calm', 'nerves', 'Canada', 'couple', 'weeks', 'Jimmy', 'charge', 'program', 'whole', 'group', 'musicians', 'Jimmy', 'McCorkles', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'put', 'band', 'air', 'radio', 'show', 'even', 'offer', 'listening', 'audience', 'chance', 'win', 'big', 'money', 'spinning', 'wheel', 'Band', 'big', 'success', 'gaining', 'valuable', 'sponsors', 'air', 'time', 'when', 'Uncle', 'Harry', 'back', 'Canada', 'furious', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'music', 'show', 'Uncle', 'Harry', 'provided', 'much', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'movie', 'surprise', 'movie', 'Jimmy', 'S.', 'ALWAYS', 'good', 'array', 'wonderful', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'Big', 'Band', 'sound', 'song', 'dance', 'routine', 'jail', 'cell', 'very', 'good', 'Knife', 'Fork', 'Spoon', 'routine', 'dining', 'table', 'McCorkles', 'Boarding', 'House', 'work', 'genius', 'Rhumba', 'numbers', 'are', 'glamour', 'personified', 'many', 'spats', 'Jimmy', 'Miss', 'McCorkle', 'love', 'out', 'everyone', 'happy', 'great', 'movie', 'made', 'better', 'song', 'dance', 'extravaganza']",N/A
