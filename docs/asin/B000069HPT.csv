707084,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B000069HPT,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[1, 1]","I really enjoy this series.  It dates to the late seventies and shows it.  The ambiance is very ""theater"" with a touch of natural outdoor settings added for verisimilitude, which gives the viewer without theater exposure some degree of understanding of the genre.  Filmed live on a stage, there are exits and enterances, props and characteristic costume, etc. that give the theater feel. Actually soap operas do the same thing for the same reasons.The stories are absolute gems and present issues that arise not only before the English bench but before most legal systems at one time or another.  More than anything the stories deal with the underlying concept of justice in principle as opposed to justice in practice; something that is very much still an issue in our own time.  They also highlight the differences between a free society ruled by law and a tyranny ruled by the whim of those in power.  Defending a person that no one likes, not even his barrister, is Rumpole's responsibility in one episode, ""Rumpole and the Fascist Beast,"" and as he rightly points out in a just society everyone has the right to due process; if exceptions are made, then everyone is at risk.  Often he defends and achieves acquittal for the guilty, but here as he notes, everyone is entitled to the best defense he can give them and it is for the prosecution to prove guilt.  While it sometimes seems wrong, especially for those for whom major losses fail to gain closure, it is the presumption of innocence and the need to prove guilt that underlies the legal system.  A person cannot be forced to admit guilt, and it is this fact that, while it may allow a guilty person to escape punishment, protects us all from abuses by authority which may force innocent people to admit to crimes they have not committed.  The tale of ""Rumple and the Show Folk"" and the case of ""Rumpole and the Age for Retirement"" are cases in point.Probably more than anything, the actual experiences of the author, himself a barrister who practiced defense law, and his knowledge of issues occuring at the time, give these episodes great credibility.  His prologue discussion to each episode bring in experiences from his cases and those of others, illuminating where a Rumpole case came from and how it took shape.  It shows too how the creative person uses events of his or her time to create works that encapsulate the true significance of them.On a personal level, Rumpole is afflicted by the prejudices of the young against the old, forcing him to retire before he is ready.  His visit to his son and daughter-in-law in Florida leave him feeling adrift, while his wife, ""she who must be obeyed"" seems to thrive in the setting.  More than anything it shows that societal prejudice against the active and useful older person arise at least in part through the ambitious machinations of younger individuals eager to compete and forge their way ahead rather than by actual inabilities by the older worker.  This is evident in these works from the 1970s and are and will be very evident now that the very large Baby Boomer generation is aging.As usual the cast of regulars makes the whole thing come alive.  The members of chamber are more like Rumpole's ""other family,"" and like so many families, its dysfunctions are as important to the narrative as are its normal relationships.  My favorites are Claude Erskin Brown whose character while sometimes a pain is also quite dear.  Phyllida becomes his wife in this series, and though she almost strays in one episode, as she points out she'd never give up ""a husband who can cook"" for an ambitious young lothario!  Guthrie Featherstone is bumbling and well intentioned.  Always trying to be the person everyone else seems to expect him to be, he is befriended by Rumpole at a key moment and is rescued from his own silliness just in time.  It is, in fact, Rumpole's dealings with his coworkers that most clearly defines his own character.  When I first viewed the series--starting with the third in the series--I didn't think I liked the man at all.  It was only through glimpses of his true character, so often disguised by his mutterings and complaints, that one comes to admire and enjoy him.  He's a very curmudeonly person, but his head is always clear and his attention focused on the central good.  He's patient with other people's weaknesses--unless they're a judge--and manages to keep many of them from injuring themselves.A lovely series of British mysteries with a lot to say about society.",5,A lovely series of British mysteries with a lot to say about society,1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,4515,"['really', 'enjoy', 'series', 'late', 'seventies', 'ambiance', 'very', 'theater', 'touch', 'natural', 'outdoor', 'settings', 'added', 'verisimilitude', 'viewer', 'theater', 'exposure', 'degree', 'understanding', 'genre', 'Filmed', 'live', 'stage', 'are', 'exits', 'enterances', 'props', 'characteristic', 'costume', 'etc', 'give', 'theater', 'feel', 'Actually', 'soap', 'operas', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'same', 'reasons.The', 'stories', 'are', 'absolute', 'gems', 'present', 'issues', 'arise', 'not', 'only', 'English', 'bench', 'most', 'legal', 'systems', 'one', 'time', 'More', 'anything', 'stories', 'deal', 'underlying', 'concept', 'justice', 'principle', 'opposed', 'justice', 'practice', 'something', 'very', 'much', 'still', 'issue', 'own', 'time', 'also', 'highlight', 'differences', 'free', 'society', 'ruled', 'law', 'tyranny', 'ruled', 'whim', 'power', 'Defending', 'person', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'barrister', 'Rumpole', 'responsibility', 'one', 'episode', 'Rumpole', 'Fascist', 'Beast', 'rightly', 'out', 'just', 'society', 'everyone', 'right', 'due', 'process', 'exceptions', 'are', 'made', 'then', 'everyone', 'risk', 'acquittal', 'guilty', 'here', 'everyone', 'entitled', 'best', 'defense', 'can', 'give', 'prosecution', 'prove', 'guilt', 'sometimes', 'wrong', 'especially', 'whom', 'major', 'losses', 'fail', 'gain', 'closure', 'presumption', 'innocence', 'need', 'prove', 'guilt', 'legal', 'system', 'person', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'forced', 'admit', 'guilt', 'fact', 'may', 'allow', 'guilty', 'person', 'escape', 'punishment', 'abuses', 'authority', 'may', 'force', 'innocent', 'people', 'admit', 'crimes', 'have', 'not', 'committed', 'tale', 'Rumple', 'Show', 'Folk', 'case', 'Rumpole', 'Age', 'Retirement', 'are', 'cases', 'point.Probably', 'more', 'anything', 'actual', 'experiences', 'author', 'barrister', 'who', 'practiced', 'defense', 'law', 'knowledge', 'issues', 'occuring', 'time', 'give', 'episodes', 'great', 'credibility', 'prologue', 'discussion', 'episode', 'bring', 'experiences', 'cases', 'others', 'illuminating', 'where', 'Rumpole', 'case', 'came', 'how', 'took', 'shape', 'too', 'how', 'creative', 'person', 'events', 'time', 'create', 'works', 'encapsulate', 'true', 'significance', 'them.On', 'personal', 'level', 'Rumpole', 'afflicted', 'prejudices', 'young', 'old', 'forcing', 'retire', 'ready', 'visit', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'Florida', 'leave', 'feeling', 'adrift', 'wife', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'obeyed', 'thrive', 'setting', 'More', 'anything', 'societal', 'prejudice', 'active', 'useful', 'older', 'person', 'arise', 'least', 'part', 'ambitious', 'machinations', 'younger', 'individuals', 'eager', 'compete', 'forge', 'way', 'ahead', 'rather', 'actual', 'inabilities', 'older', 'worker', 'evident', 'works', '1970s', 'are', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'evident', 'now', 'very', 'large', 'Baby', 'Boomer', 'generation', 'aging.As', 'usual', 'cast', 'regulars', 'whole', 'thing', 'come', 'alive', 'members', 'chamber', 'are', 'more', 'Rumpole', 'other', 'family', 'so', 'many', 'families', 'dysfunctions', 'are', 'important', 'narrative', 'are', 'normal', 'relationships', 'favorites', 'are', 'Claude', 'Erskin', 'Brown', 'character', 'sometimes', 'pain', 'also', 'quite', 'dear', 'Phyllida', 'wife', 'series', 'almost', 'strays', 'one', 'episode', 'out', ""'d"", 'never', 'give', 'up', 'husband', 'who', 'can', 'cook', 'ambitious', 'young', 'lothario', 'Guthrie', 'Featherstone', 'bumbling', 'well', 'intentioned', 'Always', 'trying', 'be', 'person', 'everyone', 'else', 'expect', 'be', 'befriended', 'Rumpole', 'key', 'moment', 'rescued', 'own', 'silliness', 'just', 'time', 'fact', 'Rumpole', 'dealings', 'coworkers', 'most', 'clearly', 'own', 'character', 'When', 'first', 'viewed', 'series', 'starting', 'third', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'liked', 'man', 'was', 'only', 'glimpses', 'true', 'character', 'so', 'often', 'disguised', 'mutterings', 'complaints', 'one', 'admire', 'enjoy', 'very', 'curmudeonly', 'person', 'head', 'always', 'clear', 'attention', 'focused', 'central', 'good', 'patient', 'other', 'people', 'weaknesses', ""'re"", 'judge', 'manages', 'keep', 'many', 'injuring', 'themselves.A', 'lovely', 'series', 'British', 'mysteries', 'lot', 'say', 'society']",N/A

Behrens ""Frank Behrens""","[25, 25]","By far, one of the more popular series that came over the Atlantic to our PBS television stations was the six-season ""Rumpole of the Bailey"" with Leo McKern as the craggy-faced barrister. Few of us realized that there was once a single Rumpole teleplay, ""Rumpole and the Confession of Guilt,"" now available on an Acorn Media DVD (AMP-6684), that inspired the series and is a Must for fans of what followed.While all six seasons have been long available on video tapes, about a year ago HBO finally came out on DVD with the first two seasons. After a wait for the rest, A&E; has suddenly put out not only the first two seasons as a redone boxed set (AAE71659)but at the same time has given us seasons three and four (AAE71664). Added to the format are introductions to each episode by Rumpole's creator, John Mortimer; but I am afraid all he talks about is the plot and reveals too much of what follows. Better to skip them on first viewing.So now we have the first 12 episodes with all the amusing characters, most of whom drive Rumpole up a wall, the leader being his wife ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"" Hilda Rumpole, played first by Peggy Thorpe-Bates, then by Marion Mathie. Most of his fellow lawyers are pretty incompetent chaps: Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles), Claude Erskine-Brown (Julian Curry), and ""Soapy Sam"" Ballard (Peter Blythe). Even worse than these are the judges-from-hell: Graves (Robin Bailey), Bullingham (Bill Fraser), and Oliphant (James Grout).The professional women are far more competent: Elizabeth Probert (played first by Samantha Bond, later by Abigail McKern) and Rumpole's favorite ""Portia,"" Phyllida Trant and later Mrs. Erskine-Brown (Patricia Hodge).Other than the humor, the insight into the British legal system, the high quality acting, and the immortal family of villains, the Timsons, we have the double plots. Each episode develops  a theme that is the basis of both the trial in question and of the events of the framing device. For example, the trial of a neo-fascist who wants a purely white England takes place after Hilda has commented on the number of non-white faces in London lately.An added inducement to purchase the first boxed set of seasons 1 and 2 is the inclusion of the feature-length story ""Rumpole's Return.""

These date from the late 1970s and early 1980s but don't seem out of date at all.  The first season's shows are all dated with the year they supposedly occured, starting with 1967 and going on until 1977. The characters all age appropriately and incidentally provide a good record of changes in British fashion. (All except Rumpole, who always dresses the same.)

707097,A3QIEISBZP4QTV,B000069HPT,"Mark E. Baxter ""Inquirer""","[3, 4]","This set is the first two seasons of ""Rumpole of the Bailey"", a British series combining comedy and law.  The series is based on  the character of Horace Rumpole, an aging London defense lawyer.  The author, John Mortimer, has written a series of novels and short stories over many years.  I highly recommend the books.  They are able to add texture that the television series can't capture.There are 4 discs, each containing 3 hour-long episodes.  There are no sub-titles available.  Since the sound quality is not the greatest, this is a real problem because there are certain parts of the dialogue that you will never get, no matter how many times you replay.  The sound quality is not horrible, just not very good - like all British based television series from the time, the production values just aren't very high.  The author, John Mortimer, introduces each episode.  Mortimer is a well-known author of books from Rumpole stories to his memoirs.  He also has written a number of screenplays and other television series.  Mortimer was also a practicing lawyer who is known for making Pornography legal in England.Each episode is based on a short-story concerning a case of Rumpole's.  Also included are side stories of Rumpole's family and co-workers.  The show is almost perfectly cast, especially Leo McKern who plays Rumpole.  The supporting cast is also well-chosen.  The series itself is wonderful because of the casting and the stories of Mortimer.  The humor of the series is its strongest point.  Each episode usually brings up some social issue like presumption of innocence or trial by jury.  I especially enjoy the police, prosecution, and judges who are all opposed and ridiculed by Rumpole.Given the current state of much of television, I much prefer popping in one of these episodes to viewing the latest garbage on the networks.  The set is rather pricy(> 5 bucks an episode), especially given the paucity of extra features.

For the uninitiated, however, be aware this may well be an acquired taste -- all the best things in life are.Here's a litmus test: see if you find this story amusing.  A judge had before him an elderly con who's been convicted so many times they are on a first name basis.  He sentences him to 20 years and the man looks up and says &quot;But, your honor, I'm a very old man and don't have too many years left.  I don't know that I can do 20 years.&quot;  &quot;Well,&quot; says the judge, &quot;you just do as much as you can.&quot;That's one of the stories that Rumpole loves to tell, and it's typical of the kinds of scenerios this barrister finds himself facing.  One of the best things about having these episodes on DVD is you can quickly skip back and reply scenes -- every single reviewing will reward you with new treats.Leo played a part written especially for him, and it's almost impossible to tell where he leaves off and Rumpole begins.  The Rumpole series has never been collected in this organized a fashion before (previous releases came in a bewildering array of assorted sets that mixed years willy-nilly) and this is a perfect place to get aquainted with the most erudite and witty barrister the other side of the Big Pond.

707102,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000069HPT,Robert Moore,"[19, 20]","Film and television has over the decades seen the appearance of a host of enormously talented character actors who have only rarely had opportunities to assuming lead or starring roles.  Charles Laughton was the great exception, somehow managing a host of starring roles over the decades.  But the great Bert Lahr, despite his considerable gifts, had a great stage career (including Samuel Beckett's landmark WAITING FOR GODOT) managed only one great film, as the Cowardly Lion in THE WIZARD OF OZ.  Robert Newton managed a few good screen roles, including a turn as the greatest Long John Silver ever in the 1950s Disney version of TREASURE ISLAND, but for the most part cinema never found a way to incorporate his considerable but over-the-top skills.  The fact is that many of our greatest character actors project a persona that is a bit too large for either film or TV.  Bert Lahr had the gigantic personality of a Warner Brothers cartoon character, and there were simply very, very few film roles that could accommodate his talent.Leo McKern is very much in this tradition of the great ham character actor whose personality outstrips all but a very few roles.  No one who had previously seen him in films like RYAN'S DAUGHTER (as Ryan) or A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS (as More's prosecutor) or the legendary TV series THE PRISONER (as the best Number Two on the show) could doubt his talent.  But the force of his personality and the power of his voice, as well as his short, stout build and globular face (as well as having a glass left eye as the result of a childhood accident), made him in appropriate for almost all film and television roles.  He wasn't merely bigger than life:  he was bigger than the silver screen and television.  Thankfully, near the end of his life he managed the role of a lifetime as Horace Rumpole in the serialization of John Mortimer's Rumpole of the Bailey stories.  The role is a perfect showcase for McKern's talents, and he clearly threw himself into it with all the gusto of which he was capable.  It is almost impossible to imagine anyone else in this role so completely does he make it his own.  To be honest, McKern is the only thing that makes these shows worth watching a quarter of a century after their first appearance.  The stories are often fun, frequently clever, and the supporting cast is consistently superb, but the fact is that there have been dozens of excellent shows over the decades, and few lay legitimate claim for our attention.  RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY does lay such claim, but almost entirely because of McKern's transcendently excellent performance as the title character.  Obviously, the show's writers knew this at the time, for every second of the show is structured to give McKern as fine a platform as possible for the display of his particular virtues as an actor.  Whether quoting English poetry, or cross-examining a witness during a trial, or wincing under the complaints of ""she who must be obeyed,"" or reacting to some inane comment by some absurd English judge, every conceivable opportunity is provided for McKern to boom out in that marvelous voice of his Rumpole's words.I don't want to imply that McKern is the only good thing in the show.  The scripts, largely adapted from stories by writer and sometimes barrister John Mortimer, are consistently interesting and contain a host of marvelous moments.  The series is also enriched by a large and highly talented cast, including Peter Bowles as Guthrie Featherstone, head of chambers for much of the series, though his ambition takes him to many new roles; Patricia Hodge as Phyllida Erkine-Brown nee Trant, whom Rumpole dubs their chambers' ""Portia; Julian Curry as Claude Erskine-Brown, whose interests in ""the Law"" run as counter to Rumpole's as possible; and, of course, the Peggy Thorpe-Bates, the first of two actresses to portray Hilda, ""she who must be obeyed.""This is not among the greatest shows ever made, but it is certainly one of the most enjoyable and contains what is unquestionably one of the great characters in the history of TV.  The cable TV network Bravo recently compiled a list of the 100 Greatest Television Characters, which was very poorly named, since it considered only American television characters.  Had English shows been included, there is little question that Horace Rumpole would have occupied a prominent place on the list.",5,Showcases one of the most unique actors ever on TV,1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,4385,"['Film', 'television', 'over', 'decades', 'seen', 'appearance', 'host', 'enormously', 'talented', 'character', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'only', 'rarely', 'had', 'opportunities', 'assuming', 'lead', 'starring', 'roles', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'was', 'great', 'exception', 'somehow', 'managing', 'host', 'starring', 'roles', 'decades', 'great', 'Bert', 'Lahr', 'considerable', 'gifts', 'had', 'great', 'stage', 'career', 'including', 'Samuel', 'Beckett', 'landmark', 'WAITING', 'FOR', 'GODOT', 'managed', 'only', 'one', 'great', 'film', 'Cowardly', 'Lion', 'THE', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'Robert', 'Newton', 'managed', 'few', 'good', 'screen', 'roles', 'including', 'turn', 'greatest', 'Long', 'John', 'Silver', 'ever', '1950s', 'Disney', 'version', 'TREASURE', 'ISLAND', 'most', 'part', 'cinema', 'never', 'found', 'way', 'incorporate', 'considerable', 'over-the-top', 'skills', 'fact', 'many', 'greatest', 'character', 'actors', 'project', 'persona', 'bit', 'too', 'large', 'film', 'TV', 'Bert', 'Lahr', 'had', 'gigantic', 'personality', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'cartoon', 'character', 'were', 'simply', 'very', 'very', 'few', 'film', 'roles', 'could', 'accommodate', 'talent.Leo', 'McKern', 'very', 'much', 'tradition', 'great', 'ham', 'character', 'actor', 'personality', 'very', 'few', 'roles', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'seen', 'films', 'RYAN', 'DAUGHTER', 'Ryan', 'MAN', 'ALL', 'SEASONS', 'More', 'prosecutor', 'legendary', 'TV', 'series', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'best', 'Number', 'Two', 'show', 'could', 'doubt', 'talent', 'force', 'personality', 'power', 'voice', 'as', 'well', 'short', 'stout', 'build', 'globular', 'face', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'glass', 'left', 'eye', 'result', 'childhood', 'accident', 'made', 'appropriate', 'almost', 'film', 'television', 'roles', 'was', ""n't"", 'merely', 'bigger', 'life', 'was', 'bigger', 'silver', 'screen', 'television', 'Thankfully', 'end', 'life', 'managed', 'role', 'lifetime', 'Horace', 'Rumpole', 'serialization', 'John', 'Mortimer', 'Rumpole', 'Bailey', 'stories', 'role', 'perfect', 'showcase', 'McKern', 'talents', 'clearly', 'threw', 'gusto', 'was', 'capable', 'almost', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'role', 'so', 'completely', 'make', 'own', 'be', 'honest', 'McKern', 'only', 'thing', 'shows', 'worth', 'watching', 'quarter', 'century', 'first', 'appearance', 'stories', 'are', 'often', 'fun', 'frequently', 'clever', 'supporting', 'cast', 'consistently', 'superb', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'dozens', 'excellent', 'shows', 'decades', 'few', 'lay', 'legitimate', 'claim', 'attention', 'RUMPOLE', 'THE', 'BAILEY', 'lay', 'such', 'claim', 'almost', 'entirely', 'McKern', 'transcendently', 'excellent', 'performance', 'title', 'character', 'Obviously', 'show', 'writers', 'knew', 'time', 'second', 'show', 'structured', 'give', 'McKern', 'fine', 'platform', 'possible', 'display', 'particular', 'virtues', 'actor', 'Whether', 'quoting', 'English', 'poetry', 'cross-examining', 'witness', 'trial', 'wincing', 'complaints', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'obeyed', 'reacting', 'inane', 'comment', 'absurd', 'English', 'judge', 'conceivable', 'opportunity', 'provided', 'McKern', 'boom', 'out', 'marvelous', 'voice', 'Rumpole', 'words.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'imply', 'McKern', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'show', 'scripts', 'largely', 'adapted', 'stories', 'writer', 'sometimes', 'barrister', 'John', 'Mortimer', 'are', 'consistently', 'interesting', 'contain', 'host', 'marvelous', 'moments', 'series', 'also', 'enriched', 'large', 'highly', 'talented', 'cast', 'including', 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'Guthrie', 'Featherstone', 'head', 'chambers', 'much', 'series', 'ambition', 'many', 'new', 'roles', 'Patricia', 'Hodge', 'Phyllida', 'Erkine-Brown', 'nee', 'Trant', 'whom', 'Rumpole', 'dubs', 'chambers', 'Portia', 'Julian', 'Curry', 'Claude', 'Erskine-Brown', 'interests', 'Law', 'run', 'counter', 'Rumpole', 'possible', 'course', 'Peggy', 'Thorpe-Bates', 'first', 'two', 'actresses', 'portray', 'Hilda', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'obeyed', 'not', 'greatest', 'shows', 'ever', 'made', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'what', 'unquestionably', 'one', 'great', 'characters', 'history', 'TV', 'cable', 'TV', 'network', 'Bravo', 'recently', 'compiled', 'list', '100', 'Greatest', 'Television', 'Characters', 'was', 'very', 'poorly', 'named', 'considered', 'only', 'American', 'television', 'characters', 'Had', 'English', 'been', 'included', 'little', 'question', 'Horace', 'Rumpole', 'would', 'have', 'occupied', 'prominent', 'place', 'list']",N/A

The lead actor's characterization is superb, the episodes presents *very* diverse scenarios (not like my favorite Law & Order by any respect), yet there are relationships that carry enough interest to be carried forward into each episode (though not in a soap opera kind of way).  The humor is very, very dry but there are some knee-slapping, laugh-aloud moments.  I liked this series enough to actually agree to purchase the others for him when they come out.  It certainly helps that it is a well-designed, well-packaged set.  I am happy to recommend this to others who are considering it as a gift for Rumpole fans.",5,Another reluctant spouse won over,1043971200,"01 31, 2003",2003,1181,"['husband', 'certainly', 'uh', 'eclectic', 'viewing', 'tastes', 'usually', 'treat', 'enthusiastic', 'ravings', 'old', 'television', 'shows', 'movies', 'roll', 'eye', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Rumpole', 'series', 'kept', 'going', 'when', 'planned', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'fell', 'scoured', 'Amazon.com', 'alternative', 'held', 'breath', 'choosing', 'purchase', 'knew', 'buying', 'DVD', 'set', 'would', 'mean', ""*I'd*"", 'have', 'watch', 'Well', 'am', 'writing', 'say', 'one', 'husband', 'LOVED', 'gift', 'two', 'surprisingly', 'so', 'did', 'lead', 'actor', 'characterization', 'superb', 'episodes', 'presents', '*very*', 'diverse', 'scenarios', 'not', 'favorite', 'Law', 'Order', 'respect', 'yet', 'are', 'relationships', 'carry', 'enough', 'interest', 'be', 'carried', 'forward', 'episode', 'not', 'soap', 'opera', 'kind', 'way', 'humor', 'very', 'very', 'dry', 'are', 'knee-slapping', 'laugh-aloud', 'moments', 'liked', 'series', 'enough', 'actually', 'agree', 'purchase', 'others', 'when', 'come', 'out', 'certainly', 'well-designed', 'well-packaged', 'set', 'am', 'happy', 'recommend', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'considering', 'gift', 'Rumpole', 'fans']",N/A

This gives a good insight into how the legal system works across the pond.  Rumpole is hilarious.  I don't see how anyone cannot love this grumpy old man.  The court scenes are also entertaining as you watch Rumpole box witnesses into corners.  As an aside,  my order arrived in great time from a great seller.",5,Great Series.,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,382,"['have', 'get', 'use', 'British', 'humor', 'really', 'appreciate', 'series', 'good', 'insight', 'how', 'legal', 'system', 'pond', 'Rumpole', 'hilarious', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'court', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Rumpole', 'box', 'corners', 'aside', 'order', 'arrived', 'great', 'time', 'great', 'seller']",N/A
