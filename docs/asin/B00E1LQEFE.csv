1663577,A234X1MVIMPMMC,B00E1LQEFE,"Akima Rolle ""Book Junkie""","[0, 0]",The movie Fruitvale Station is a gritty true life story of 22 year old Oscar Grant and his family. The movie shows the trials and tribulations of Oscar and his quest to change his life and make a better life for his family especially his daughter. Michael B. Jordan does a great job portraying Grant a good guy with a big heart who made a few mistakes early in his life and Jordan gives you a little glimpse into his life. Oscar winning actress Octavia Spencer plays Grant's mom and the emotions she showed draws you into the character so much you forget she's acting. Fruitvale Station was one of the most emotional movies I have seen and I cried for the last ten minutes of the movie. I used this movie as a learning experience for my 15 year old African American son because I want Grant's life to act as teaching experience for so many impressionable youths today.Spoiler Alert:Fruitvale Station is a heartbreaking film that shows the final days of Oscar Grant's life before he was senselessly murdered by a California police at the Fruitvale train station. I was angry because it could have been avoided and all the events leading up to the murder was like a perfect storm for a disaster.,5,Heartbreaking!!,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,1193,"['movie', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'gritty', 'true', 'life', 'story', '22', 'year', 'old', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'family', 'movie', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Oscar', 'quest', 'change', 'life', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'family', 'especially', 'daughter', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Grant', 'good', 'guy', 'big', 'heart', 'who', 'made', 'few', 'mistakes', 'early', 'life', 'Jordan', 'little', 'glimpse', 'life', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'actress', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'Grant', 'mom', 'emotions', 'showed', 'draws', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'forget', 'acting', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'emotional', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'cried', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'used', 'movie', 'learning', 'experience', '15', 'year', 'old', 'African', 'American', 'son', 'want', 'Grant', 'life', 'act', 'teaching', 'experience', 'so', 'many', 'impressionable', 'youths', 'today.Spoiler', 'Alert', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'heartbreaking', 'film', 'final', 'days', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'life', 'was', 'senselessly', 'murdered', 'California', 'police', 'Fruitvale', 'train', 'station', 'was', 'angry', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'murder', 'was', 'perfect', 'storm', 'disaster']",N/A

1663585,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00E1LQEFE,Andrew Ellington,"[10, 16]","So, walking into `Fruitvale Station', I was anticipating a film that was constructed to move me.  I expected it to paint Oscar Grant as a martyr, a saint and a moral lesson.  I expected an abundance of clich&eacute;s and stereotypes to litter the movie and I expected the political assessment of the whole unfortunate incident to be plastered across every frame.  That isn't because I read into complaints (I'm not even sure if that is a complaint, and quite frankly I don't see how it could be one unless you want to get ultra-picky and complain about the 'obviousness' regarding the conversation he has with his daughter) but because this is a biopic about a controversial subject that is recent and has similarities with yet another recent, tragic event.I assumed wrong.What `Fruitvale Station' is, is a tightly woven look at the day in the life of a young, troubled man who is shuffling responsibilities, trying to straighten out his life and maintain his identity at the same time while weighing out the consequences of growing up in a place where his options are limited.  Already been locked up once, Oscar doesn't want to go back, but his lifestyle and carefree attitude have cost him his job (fired for being late too often) and has placed his relationship with the mother of his daughter on the rocks.  When the film opens Oscar is having a minor argument with his girlfriend, Sophina, about a tryst he had with another woman.  What spoke to me was the marvelous balance that both actor Michael B. Jordan and writer/director Ryan Coogler gave to Oscar.  They showed us his flaws.  He doesn't take life seriously, he likes his narcotics, he allows temptation to get the best of him, he has a temper; and yet they also layer him with a natural charisma and charm that allow us to see his heart.  Oscar Grant was not a `bad guy', but he wasn't perfect either.As the film progresses we see Oscar plan for his mother's birthday party, contemplate his future and reflect on his past.  We see him try and rekindle things with Sophina and we get to see the natural glow of their relationship.  Both Jordan and Melonie Diaz bring such chemistry to their performances, helping draw us into their lives.But yes, the whole film seems to boil down to the inevitable.  I was worried that that was going to be a problem for me with this film.  When you know how something is going to end you tend to wait for the entirety of the film to see how that is going to play out.  You tend to want to rush the rest of the movie because you already know what everything is leading up to.  I never felt that here.  The film is a brisk 85 minutes, and things are so tightly woven that you never had a chance to want it to speed up.  We are given just enough to color in this young man's life and where he is at that given moment, right before everything is torn away from him.  The final twenty minutes or so are neckbreak chaos and tension, but perfectly honed to sustain that tension and create a real sense of panic.  It doesn't hurt that the young actors are so natural and believable in their respective roles.  The brutality of the situation is kept honest, and the awareness of how far things had gone takes shape in unexpected places.  I was really impressed with the way that Coogler handled the police officers, mainly because the depiction of their actions was so abrasive and yet when shots are fired you can read the immediate retraction in their eyes.  You can tell that they understood the gravity of their actions and so this is not just a stereotypical depiction of `the villain'.The bookends are tear jerkers, for sure.  Having actual footage of the murder and then this year's vigil outside Fruitvale Station (along with video of Grant's young daughter) was enough to reduce me to a puddle, but it was not mere surface tears, for the heart of this film speaks loudly.",5,My heart is broken...,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,3870,"['So', 'walking', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'was', 'anticipating', 'film', 'was', 'constructed', 'move', 'expected', 'paint', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'martyr', 'saint', 'moral', 'lesson', 'expected', 'abundance', 'clich', 'eacute', 'stereotypes', 'litter', 'movie', 'expected', 'political', 'assessment', 'whole', 'unfortunate', 'incident', 'be', 'plastered', 'frame', ""n't"", 'read', 'complaints', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'complaint', 'quite', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'want', 'get', 'ultra-picky', 'complain', ""'obviousness"", 'regarding', 'conversation', 'daughter', 'biopic', 'controversial', 'subject', 'recent', 'similarities', 'yet', 'recent', 'tragic', 'event.I', 'assumed', 'wrong.What', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'tightly', 'woven', 'look', 'day', 'life', 'young', 'troubled', 'man', 'who', 'shuffling', 'responsibilities', 'trying', 'straighten', 'out', 'life', 'maintain', 'identity', 'same', 'time', 'weighing', 'out', 'consequences', 'growing', 'up', 'place', 'where', 'options', 'are', 'limited', 'Already', 'been', 'locked', 'up', 'once', 'Oscar', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'back', 'lifestyle', 'carefree', 'attitude', 'have', 'cost', 'job', 'fired', 'being', 'late', 'too', 'often', 'placed', 'relationship', 'mother', 'daughter', 'rocks', 'When', 'film', 'Oscar', 'having', 'minor', 'argument', 'girlfriend', 'Sophina', 'tryst', 'had', 'woman', 'What', 'spoke', 'was', 'marvelous', 'balance', 'actor', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'writer/director', 'Ryan', 'Coogler', 'gave', 'Oscar', 'showed', 'flaws', ""n't"", 'take', 'life', 'seriously', 'narcotics', 'temptation', 'get', 'best', 'temper', 'yet', 'also', 'layer', 'natural', 'charisma', 'charm', 'allow', 'see', 'heart', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'either.As', 'film', 'see', 'Oscar', 'plan', 'mother', 'birthday', 'party', 'contemplate', 'future', 'reflect', 'past', 'see', 'try', 'rekindle', 'things', 'Sophina', 'get', 'see', 'natural', 'glow', 'relationship', 'Jordan', 'Melonie', 'Diaz', 'bring', 'such', 'chemistry', 'performances', 'helping', 'draw', 'lives.But', 'yes', 'whole', 'film', 'boil', 'down', 'inevitable', 'was', 'worried', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'problem', 'film', 'When', 'know', 'how', 'something', 'going', 'end', 'tend', 'wait', 'entirety', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'tend', 'want', 'rush', 'rest', 'movie', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'everything', 'leading', 'up', 'never', 'felt', 'here', 'film', 'brisk', '85', 'minutes', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'tightly', 'woven', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'want', 'speed', 'up', 'are', 'given', 'just', 'enough', 'color', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'where', 'given', 'moment', 'right', 'everything', 'torn', 'away', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'neckbreak', 'chaos', 'tension', 'perfectly', 'honed', 'sustain', 'tension', 'create', 'real', 'sense', 'panic', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'natural', 'believable', 'respective', 'roles', 'brutality', 'situation', 'kept', 'honest', 'awareness', 'how', 'far', 'things', 'had', 'gone', 'shape', 'unexpected', 'places', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'way', 'Coogler', 'handled', 'police', 'officers', 'mainly', 'depiction', 'actions', 'was', 'so', 'abrasive', 'yet', 'when', 'shots', 'are', 'fired', 'can', 'read', 'immediate', 'retraction', 'eyes', 'can', 'tell', 'understood', 'gravity', 'actions', 'so', 'not', 'just', 'stereotypical', 'depiction', ""villain'.The"", 'bookends', 'are', 'tear', 'jerkers', 'sure', 'Having', 'actual', 'footage', 'murder', 'then', 'year', 'vigil', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'video', 'Grant', 'young', 'daughter', 'was', 'enough', 'reduce', 'puddle', 'was', 'not', 'mere', 'surface', 'tears', 'heart', 'film', 'loudly']",N/A

It's the story of Oscar Grant, a young black man from the Bay Area who was shot and killed by BART Police while lying on his stomach and handcuffed on the floor of Fruitvale Station. What is most effective about the film is how it takes us through the last day of Oscar's life from his point of view, on New Year's Eve 2008, as he interacts with his girlfriend (Melonie Diaz), dotes on his young daughter and takes her to preschool, and prepares for his mother's (Octavia Spencer) birthday party. Oscar isn't perfect - we learn in flashback that he's done time, but he's trying to get his life back together. He can be sociable and charming, but he also has a volatile temper, which is a factor later on.  The director depicts the unfolding of events of that New Year's Eve and early New Year's Day with an effective sense of foreboding.  According to the film, Oscar is provoked into a brief fight by a former white inmate who recognizes him on the train. At the next station the transit police, thinking he and his friends are the instigators, haul them off the train and detain them at taser-point and gunpoint.  In the escalating tension and chaos that follows, Grant is handcuffed and then shot in the back.  The film seems deliberately unclear about whether the shooting was intentional or accidental, but regardless, Oscar Grant did not deserve to die that way. The incident sparked outrage after cellphone videos from fellow passengers documented the incident. As for the performances, Michael B. Jordan is excellent as Grant, Octavia Spencer is wonderful as usual, and the supporting cast is strong.

This film made me so angry that I wanted to scream. I cried and I will never forget what happened to Mr. Grant. The film does not try to make him into a saint. It just tells you about Oscar and the events that led up to his meeting with a careless cop. The film is rated R mainly for profanity. There is no sex or nudity. There is a mild scene of violence involving a gun. The film is about an African American young man who is trying to get his life together.

There was no legitimate excuse for the shooting.  Grant was shot while lying face down on the ground, with his hands cuffed behind his back.The film opens with grainy cell phone video of the actual shooting, and immediately moves back 24 hours in time and covers the last day of Oscar&#8217;s life.  Thus, the viewer knows from the opening frame that something horrible is going to happen.  Oscar (played by Michael B. Jordan) has his faults.  He served a term in jail for a drug related crime, has cheated on his girlfriend Sophia (Melonie Diaz), concealed from his loved ones that he was fired from his job at an upscale grocery store for reporting late for work, and begins the day planning to sell a stash of marijuana.  But Oscar also recognizes his faults and does his best during the course of the day to set things right.Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer gives a strong performance as Oscar&#8217;s Mother.  Jordan&#8217;s performance is masterful and, by the time the day has ended, it is impossible not to feel a genuine empathy for Oscar.  This is a powerful film and the climax is heart wrenching.  Highly recommended.There are two bonus features worth noting on the DVD version of this film.  First, there is a 21 minute segment on &#8220;The Story of Oscar Grant,&#8221; which discusses the shooting and the making of the film.

Jordan will now become a household name after his great performance. Octavia Spencer deserves an oscar for her role as the mother. Forrest Whitaker deserves one for producing this.  The movie has Oscar talking back to the police. On the actual youtube video he is not talking back. In fact he is taken and placed in a location to be executed. Many of the right wing nuts who saw this film started their conspiracies and attacked Oscar Grant even though Grant was the victim. It is said that the police officer thought he was tasering him. That is a bunch of bull. Anyone knows the difference between a taser and a gun. This reminded me of  an execution that happened in Brooklyn by the white police and young black men. A young man 14 years old was sitting on his stoop. A police car rolled up and an officer named Robert Torsney jumped out of the car and shot the teenager at point blank range in the head.Here is an excerpt of this execution. On Thanksgiving Day in 1976 an officer named Robert Torsney fired a bullet into the head of Randolph Evans, 15, outside a housing project in Brooklyn. No one could figure that one out. Officer Torsney would later claim he had been afflicted with a rare form of epilepsy that, remarkably, had never been noticed before the killing and was never seen after it.The ''epilepsy'' defense worked. Officer Torsney was acquitted of any criminal wrongdoing.Another killing that happened in New York was when a police officer named Thomas Shea killed a 10 year old Black child name Clifford Glover. Here is an excerpt from that incident  - One April morning in 1973 a veteran police officer named Thomas Shea pulled his service revolver and blew away a young black boy on a street in Jamaica, Queens. He shot the kid in the back. There was no chance of survival. Afterward, no one could figure out why the officer had done it. There was no reason for the shooting, no threat to Officer Shea of any kind. The boy's name was Clifford Glover and he was 10 years old.We now move up to the killings of Jordan Davis and Trayvon Martin. Obviously from all the police acquitals and lame excuses, white citizens are starting to think they can execute blacks and get away with it too. They are creating special coded laws to be applied by whites only to execute against blacks. In any case get this movie.

Grant was a 22 year old black man who was shot to death on the platform of Fruitvale Station in Oakland, CA by a policeman.

1663617,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00E1LQEFE,C. Sawin,"[0, 2]","&#34;Fruitvale Station&#34; generated a lot of early Oscar buzz (slight pause for the first horrible pun of the year) for lead actor Michael B. Jordan. While Jordan likely has a bright future ahead of him as an actor, his performance in the film is far from extraordinary. Jordan has one breakout scene and that's the scene where his mother (Octavia Spencer) visits him in a penitentiary in 2007. Jordan is distraught as his character goes through several different emotions that usually result in Oscar lashing out at those around him. The scene culminates with Oscar being held back by security guards as the camera looks over his mother's shoulder while she exits. The scene is explosive, intense, and emotional and the only other scene that comes close to it is when Oscar is begging for his job at Farmer Joe's. Jordan also has fantastic chemistry with Ariana Neal; the young actress that portrays Oscar's daughter Tatiana. Their time on-screen together is heartwarming, but never seems to last very long.Despite not being the biggest fan of the film, viewing the film twice was a worthwhile experience. Not only was the film slightly more enjoyable the second time around, but it's easier to notice the littler things tucked away in subtlety in films with repeat viewings. Like the importance of only seeing Oscar in the shower at the beginning of the film and then his wife and daughter sobbing and trying to make sense of things before the credits roll. While it's very common in the Bay Area and was likely inevitable to avoid while filming there, BART seems to lurk around in the background the majority of the film hinting at the sorrow that's about to come.While you can understand why anyone would want to put a film like this into production, you still question the importance of everything leading up to that moment already cemented in everyone's minds. The film tries so hard to let you know that Oscar was more than the scene of police brutality he had to suffer through and is remembered for and seeing him engage in acts of kindness that show that he's not only human but is really trying to be better for his daughter is encouraging. However seeing events like Oscar purchasing crab for his mother's birthday, holding a dog that was hit by a car as it dies, and throwing his marijuana stash away into the ocean isn't exactly riveting entertainment. Oscar feels like he's being forced back into his delinquent ways and he's a very devoted family man, but it all seems very routine and uneventful in the end. Maybe that's the point with the way things end.There are loads of talent and effort sewn into every line of dialogue and every frame of &#34;Fruitvale Station.&#34; The performances intrigue and the climax takes your breath away just as it should. But the argument is being made that the majority of the film is uninteresting. This is the story of a young man living a normal life who's taken one too many bad turns along the way and is attempting to fix them until it's all cut short. But if the rest of his life is just like yours or the guy sitting next to you or the woman walking across the street then how is that expected to keep your interest? &#34;Fruitvale Station&#34; is centered around a tragic event with a powerful message, but just lacks the momentum to actually be impressive.",3,Appalling and influential yet somehow unremarkable,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,3320,"['34', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', '34', 'generated', 'lot', 'early', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'slight', 'pause', 'first', 'horrible', 'pun', 'year', 'lead', 'actor', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'Jordan', 'likely', 'bright', 'future', 'ahead', 'actor', 'performance', 'film', 'far', 'extraordinary', 'Jordan', 'one', 'breakout', 'scene', 'scene', 'where', 'mother', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'penitentiary', '2007', 'Jordan', 'distraught', 'character', 'several', 'different', 'emotions', 'usually', 'result', 'Oscar', 'lashing', 'out', 'scene', 'Oscar', 'being', 'held', 'back', 'security', 'guards', 'camera', 'mother', 'shoulder', 'scene', 'explosive', 'intense', 'emotional', 'only', 'other', 'scene', 'close', 'when', 'Oscar', 'begging', 'job', 'Farmer', 'Joe', 'Jordan', 'also', 'fantastic', 'chemistry', 'Ariana', 'Neal', 'young', 'actress', 'Oscar', 'daughter', 'Tatiana', 'time', 'on-screen', 'together', 'heartwarming', 'never', 'last', 'very', 'long.Despite', 'not', 'being', 'biggest', 'fan', 'film', 'viewing', 'film', 'twice', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'experience', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'film', 'slightly', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'second', 'time', 'easier', 'notice', 'littler', 'things', 'tucked', 'away', 'subtlety', 'films', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'importance', 'only', 'seeing', 'Oscar', 'shower', 'beginning', 'film', 'then', 'wife', 'daughter', 'sobbing', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'things', 'credits', 'roll', 'very', 'common', 'Bay', 'Area', 'was', 'likely', 'inevitable', 'avoid', 'filming', 'there', 'BART', 'lurk', 'around', 'background', 'majority', 'film', 'hinting', 'sorrow', 'come.While', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'put', 'film', 'production', 'still', 'question', 'importance', 'everything', 'leading', 'up', 'moment', 'already', 'cemented', 'everyone', 'minds', 'film', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'let', 'know', 'Oscar', 'was', 'more', 'scene', 'police', 'brutality', 'had', 'suffer', 'remembered', 'seeing', 'engage', 'acts', 'kindness', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'human', 'really', 'trying', 'be', 'better', 'daughter', 'encouraging', 'However', 'seeing', 'events', 'Oscar', 'purchasing', 'crab', 'mother', 'birthday', 'holding', 'dog', 'was', 'hit', 'car', 'throwing', 'marijuana', 'stash', 'away', 'ocean', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'riveting', 'entertainment', 'Oscar', 'feels', 'being', 'forced', 'back', 'delinquent', 'ways', 'very', 'devoted', 'family', 'man', 'very', 'routine', 'uneventful', 'end', 'point', 'way', 'things', 'end.There', 'are', 'loads', 'talent', 'effort', 'sewn', 'line', 'dialogue', 'frame', '34', 'Fruitvale', 'Station.', '34', 'performances', 'intrigue', 'climax', 'breath', 'away', 'just', 'should', 'argument', 'being', 'made', 'majority', 'film', 'uninteresting', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'living', 'normal', 'life', 'who', 'taken', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'bad', 'turns', 'way', 'attempting', 'fix', 'cut', 'short', 'rest', 'life', 'just', 'like', 'yours', 'guy', 'sitting', 'next', 'woman', 'walking', 'street', 'then', 'how', 'expected', 'keep', 'interest', '34', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', '34', 'centered', 'tragic', 'event', 'powerful', 'message', 'just', 'momentum', 'actually', 'be', 'impressive']",N/A

1663619,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00E1LQEFE,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[57, 66]","An independent film written and directed with stunning effectiveness by newcomer Ryan Coogler, Fruitvale Station is based on a true story, and even though its story of an unarmed black male who is shot on New Year's Day, is pulled from national headlines, the film is a character study of the choices in life and how a cruel twist of fate intervenes.  It lingers in the heart and mind long after the end, and as such is one of the best films of the year.We witness video footage of police rounding up black youths at a transit train station, and while the suspects are on the ground and restrained, a gun goes off striking one of them in full view of witnesses.  What follows is a flashback account of the final day of Oscar Grant's life and the events leading up to New Year's Day 2009.  Amid the backdrop of the Oakland Bay area, Oscar (Michael B. Jordan in a breakout performance) is a young black man whose background is a mix of prison, drug dealing, and failed jobs amid a serious relationship with his girlfriend, Sophina (Melonie Diaz), and their little daughter.  He loves his family especially his mother (Octavia Spencer is rock solid) and vows to make a better life for them.  It is New Year's Eve, and he helps to prepare his mother's birthday celebration.  Just as he is on the brink of a new start, fate intervenes at a transit station and a deadly encounter with police.Oscar is a man who has a conscience and a sense of responsibility.  On the one hand he is portrayed as a devoted father, a passionate lover to his girlfriend, and loving son to his mom, and yet he lies to his loved ones and is in constant turmoil.  It is affecting to see that he genuinely wants to leave behind his broken life and get a second chance.  We root for him too, and that makes what happens at the end that much more compelling.This is the sort of subject matter, which can be viewed as an indictment of police violence and a statement on racism that might have been ideal for HBO or a filmed documentary like The Thin Blue Line.  You also expect to see a post-shooting trial, but the film focuses instead on the events and people around Oscar that lead up to the fateful moment.  It is a portrait of a young, flawed life ended before it has a chance to redeem itself.  We want to know a bit more about Oscar; what put him in prison, and what was his childhood like? Instead we get a fragment, one day in his life, about a father and his little daughter and the life they had and never will again.  The final images of Oscar's real life daughter after the events depicted in the film are touching and sobering.Coogler shows a good command of a scene and how to make it authentic.  Moments of levity such as a group countdown to New Years are counterpointed by tense confrontations from the past.  The dialogue is realistic, and you really feel you are watching a slice of real life.  The pivotal scene of the police arresting Oscar and his friends is startling and upsetting; you feel like it could happen to you.  The frantic reactions and emotions of the victims and witnesses as a shot rings out is heart wrenching.Liberal use of handheld cameras lends an immediacy and realism to the events, and there is a great shot of Sophina from behind as she reacts to the tragedy.  We don't need to see her face because we know from her body language exactly how she must feel.One wonders how much of the screenplay is based on truth, but whether this is or isn't a biased view of an event by the filmmaker, it is highly emotionally affective filmmaking. In light of other recent, racially charged headlines, it cannot help but become a hot topic.  This vivid, stark reenactment of an event that should never have happened is a relatively simple tale of a complex life, a kind of urban, American tragedy.  It is a powerful, filmic statement that raises questions that demand answers.",4,Tragedy at Fruitvale Station,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,3875,"['independent', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'stunning', 'effectiveness', 'newcomer', 'Ryan', 'Coogler', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'even', 'story', 'unarmed', 'black', 'male', 'who', 'shot', 'New', 'Year', 'Day', 'pulled', 'national', 'headlines', 'film', 'character', 'study', 'choices', 'life', 'how', 'cruel', 'twist', 'fate', 'intervenes', 'heart', 'mind', 'long', 'end', 'such', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year.We', 'witness', 'video', 'footage', 'police', 'rounding', 'up', 'black', 'youths', 'transit', 'train', 'station', 'suspects', 'are', 'ground', 'restrained', 'gun', 'striking', 'one', 'full', 'view', 'witnesses', 'What', 'flashback', 'account', 'final', 'day', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'life', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'New', 'Year', 'Day', '2009', 'backdrop', 'Oakland', 'Bay', 'area', 'Oscar', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'breakout', 'performance', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'background', 'mix', 'prison', 'drug', 'dealing', 'failed', 'jobs', 'serious', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Sophina', 'Melonie', 'Diaz', 'little', 'daughter', 'family', 'especially', 'mother', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'rock', 'solid', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'prepare', 'mother', 'birthday', 'celebration', 'Just', 'brink', 'new', 'start', 'fate', 'intervenes', 'transit', 'station', 'deadly', 'encounter', 'police.Oscar', 'man', 'who', 'conscience', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'one', 'hand', 'portrayed', 'devoted', 'father', 'passionate', 'lover', 'girlfriend', 'loving', 'son', 'mom', 'yet', 'loved', 'ones', 'constant', 'turmoil', 'affecting', 'see', 'genuinely', 'leave', 'broken', 'life', 'get', 'second', 'chance', 'root', 'too', 'what', 'end', 'much', 'more', 'compelling.This', 'sort', 'subject', 'matter', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'indictment', 'police', 'violence', 'statement', 'racism', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'ideal', 'HBO', 'filmed', 'documentary', 'Thin', 'Blue', 'Line', 'also', 'expect', 'see', 'post-shooting', 'trial', 'film', 'instead', 'events', 'people', 'Oscar', 'lead', 'up', 'fateful', 'moment', 'portrait', 'young', 'flawed', 'life', 'ended', 'chance', 'redeem', 'want', 'know', 'bit', 'more', 'Oscar', 'what', 'put', 'prison', 'what', 'was', 'childhood', 'Instead', 'get', 'fragment', 'one', 'day', 'life', 'father', 'little', 'daughter', 'life', 'had', 'never', 'will', 'again', 'final', 'images', 'Oscar', 'real', 'life', 'daughter', 'events', 'depicted', 'film', 'are', 'touching', 'sobering.Coogler', 'good', 'command', 'scene', 'how', 'make', 'authentic', 'Moments', 'levity', 'such', 'group', 'countdown', 'New', 'Years', 'are', 'counterpointed', 'tense', 'confrontations', 'past', 'dialogue', 'realistic', 'really', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'slice', 'real', 'life', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'police', 'arresting', 'Oscar', 'friends', 'startling', 'upsetting', 'feel', 'could', 'happen', 'frantic', 'reactions', 'emotions', 'victims', 'witnesses', 'shot', 'rings', 'out', 'heart', 'wrenching.Liberal', 'use', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'immediacy', 'realism', 'events', 'great', 'shot', 'Sophina', 'tragedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'face', 'know', 'body', 'language', 'exactly', 'how', 'must', 'feel.One', 'wonders', 'how', 'much', 'screenplay', 'based', 'truth', ""n't"", 'biased', 'view', 'event', 'filmmaker', 'highly', 'emotionally', 'affective', 'filmmaking', 'light', 'other', 'recent', 'racially', 'charged', 'headlines', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'become', 'hot', 'topic', 'vivid', 'stark', 'reenactment', 'event', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'relatively', 'simple', 'tale', 'complex', 'life', 'kind', 'urban', 'American', 'tragedy', 'powerful', 'filmic', 'statement', 'questions', 'demand', 'answers']",N/A

1663623,A2CNQ1JV16GHW2,B00E1LQEFE,David Cady,"[0, 1]","Ryan Coogler has made a good, but not great, film about the senseless shooting of 22 year old Oscar Grant by San Francisco transit police in the early hours of New Year's Day, 2009.  Coogler (who also wrote the screenplay) focuses on Grant's final 24 hours and, while I can sense what he was trying to do, I'm not sure that he's been wholly successful.  For me, Coogler makes far too many bids for the viewer's affection: in scene after artificial scene we're shown how kind Oscar is to children, stray dogs and strangers.  To be fair, we do see his seamier side, with a prison flashback and references to his drug dealing, but Coogler tries so hard to paint Grant as a sweet guy just trying to get by that the film starts to feel like propaganda.  (Of course, the film so obviously takes Grant's side that it would be surprising if it did not come to feel that way.)The other objection I have to ""Fruitvale Station"" is that it seems to be telling the wrong story.  Oscar's last 24 hours aren't particularly compelling or notable.  What happened AFTER his death was: the outrage, the riots, the trial and his elevation to civil rights symbol.  Again, I understand the thinking behind the film's structure.  Coogler obviously wants to create a sense of foreboding and tension, but the action is so drawn out that we feel none of those things; the pace is just too slow and flaccid.  It doesn't help that the very first image we see is the actual, famous cell phone footage of Grant being shot.  Because we've already witnessed the real thing, the murder, when recreated by actors later on, loses most of its power.What saves the film for me are the three leading performances.  Michael Jordan, Melonie Diaz and Octavia Spencer are so real, so un-actory in their approach that you really do feel as if you're watching real life and not a scripted film.

Very few motion pictures achieve this level of immediacy, and the low budget indie lack of frills only adds to the quality, as does the absolutely fine acting by everyone involved. It succeeds in being compelling even though we already know how it will end up.A couple of basic flaws: The run-over dog incident seems lifted directly fromAlways Outnumbered, based on Walter Mosley's excellent novel of the same name. There are also a few vague, patchy spots, and the story isn't as generally complete as it could be. Still, that's just part of the price paid in a film that concentrates on showing rather than telling, without being overly preachy or analytical.Some have complained about the lack of action, commentary, or anything apparently meaningful in the first hour or so. Nevertheless, the way it frames its first parts as a day-in-the-life character study of recently paroled convict Oscar Grant who, despite having his share of problems and issues, is still an affectionate (though disloyal) husband, father, and decent human being, is crucial in showing the whole significance of this true event. It is necessary for us to know Grant, his life, family, and friends a little before we plunge right into the details of his illegal shooting by Oakland's Bay Area Rapid Transit System Police(a stupid accident, really, but caused by gross negligence and at least some amount of racial profiling). The early parts of the film also provide tension and very apt foreshadowing through the use of commonplace details (police sirens, etc).Inevitably, there will be complaints that FRUITVALE STATION misrepresents this or that detail of the actual event in 2009. All I can say is that, based on what I have read--which is, admittedly, nothing beyond the raw basics--about the shooting, the makers of this film were faithful to the essential facts of the matter. I honestly do not know how the fight on the train really began, and it's possible that Oscar Grant was a bigger factor than is shown here. Nor do I know if the BART cops actually behaved this thuggishly from the get-go or how violently Grant and his friends resisted them. Regardless, the single most important fact is that one of the BART cops fatally shot the unarmed Grant in the back, stating afterward that he had mistaken his pistol for his Taser. Some idealization and oversimplification obviously took place in this film, but I can see how that was hard to avoid. It is virtually impossible to get every little fact straight in a docu-drama, and those that want to quibble are free to do so.",4,Utterly Real and Gripping: A Mesmerizing Experience,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,2730,"['4.25', 'stars', 'Regardless', 'how', 'much', 'fact', 'how', 'much', 'fiction', 'FRUITVALE', 'STATION', 'one', 'films', 'so', 'real', 'forget', 'are', 'even', 'watching', 'film', 'Very', 'few', 'motion', 'pictures', 'achieve', 'level', 'immediacy', 'low', 'budget', 'indie', 'lack', 'frills', 'only', 'quality', 'absolutely', 'fine', 'acting', 'everyone', 'involved', 'being', 'compelling', 'even', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'up.A', 'couple', 'basic', 'flaws', 'run-over', 'dog', 'incident', 'lifted', 'directly', 'fromAlways', 'Outnumbered', 'based', 'Walter', 'Mosley', 'excellent', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'vague', 'patchy', 'spots', 'story', ""n't"", 'generally', 'complete', 'could', 'be', 'Still', 'just', 'part', 'price', 'paid', 'film', 'showing', 'rather', 'telling', 'being', 'overly', 'preachy', 'analytical.Some', 'have', 'complained', 'lack', 'action', 'commentary', 'anything', 'apparently', 'meaningful', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'Nevertheless', 'way', 'first', 'parts', 'day-in-the-life', 'character', 'study', 'recently', 'paroled', 'convict', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'who', 'having', 'share', 'problems', 'issues', 'still', 'affectionate', 'disloyal', 'husband', 'father', 'decent', 'human', 'being', 'crucial', 'showing', 'whole', 'significance', 'true', 'event', 'necessary', 'know', 'Grant', 'life', 'family', 'little', 'plunge', 'right', 'details', 'illegal', 'shooting', 'Oakland', 'Bay', 'Area', 'Rapid', 'Transit', 'System', 'Police', 'stupid', 'accident', 'really', 'caused', 'gross', 'negligence', 'least', 'amount', 'racial', 'profiling', 'early', 'parts', 'film', 'also', 'provide', 'tension', 'very', 'apt', 'foreshadowing', 'use', 'commonplace', 'details', 'police', 'sirens', 'etc', '.Inevitably', 'will', 'be', 'complaints', 'FRUITVALE', 'STATION', 'detail', 'actual', 'event', '2009', 'can', 'say', 'based', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'admittedly', 'nothing', 'raw', 'basics', 'shooting', 'makers', 'film', 'were', 'faithful', 'essential', 'facts', 'matter', 'honestly', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'fight', 'train', 'really', 'began', 'possible', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'was', 'bigger', 'factor', 'shown', 'here', 'do', 'know', 'BART', 'actually', 'behaved', 'thuggishly', 'get-go', 'how', 'violently', 'Grant', 'friends', 'resisted', 'Regardless', 'single', 'most', 'important', 'fact', 'one', 'BART', 'fatally', 'shot', 'unarmed', 'Grant', 'back', 'stating', 'afterward', 'had', 'mistaken', 'pistol', 'Taser', 'idealization', 'oversimplification', 'obviously', 'took', 'place', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'hard', 'avoid', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'get', 'little', 'fact', 'straight', 'docu-drama', 'want', 'quibble', 'are', 'free', 'do', 'so']",N/A

1663635,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00E1LQEFE,FNDNreview,"[9, 13]","For those that don't remember or might not be aware of the real life incident that took place on January 1, 2009 - here's a quick refresher (no, this will not spoil the movie viewing experience).  Oscar Grant III was traveling aboard the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) with a group of his friends (returning from San Francisco) after a night of festivities for New Year's Eve.  A fight broke out on the train, involving Grant, leading to a police response at the Fruitvale BART Station platform in Oakland.  Upon their arrival, the responding officers detained Grant and a group of his friends.  In an attempt to restrain Grant, one of the officers fired his gun into Grant's back while he was face down on the ground - allegedly/mistakenly grabbing his gun instead of a Taser.  The incident was recorded via cell phone by several onlookers aboard the train.  This incident also led to a handful of protests, some of which turned to violence.  Eventually, the incident led to a high profile criminal trial for the officer that fired the shot.  In the days leading up to the incident, Grant was in the midst of making some important life changing decisions, which are the subject of the independent film, Fruitvale Station.Making his directorial debut, Fruitvale Station is directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Michael B. Jordan as Oscar Grant.  The film, based on a true story, begins as Oscar discusses his cheating indiscretion with his girlfriend and mother of his daughter, Sophina (Melonie Diaz).  Recently, Oscar has fallen on hard times, losing his job and is unsure of how he'll make money to help support his family, outside of selling drugs - for which he had already been to prison.  It also happens to be Oscar's mother's birthday and he's making preparations to celebrate with his family for dinner.  After the gathering, Oscar, Sophina, and their friends, head to San Francisco to celebrate the New Year.  However, their return trip leads to a devastating and highly controversial incident.  Octavia Spencer, Kevin Durand, and Chad Michael Murray also star in supporting roles.This film rests solely on the shoulders of Michael B. Jordan, and succeeds because of it.  If you're unfamiliar with his work, you're most likely not alone.  Jordan, a rising star in Hollywood, has previously had notable roles as Vince Howard in the final two seasons of NBC's Friday Night Lights and as Reggie Montgomery for two years on the daytime soap opera, All My Children.  His transition from television to film has clearly been smooth as he continues to impress with his knack for dramatic roles - and this role as the late Oscar Grant is no exception.  It's difficult to know how close the film's character is in comparison to the real life person, but Jordan's character is portrayed as conflicted and desperate to turn his life around.  He realizes he's made a great many mistakes in his life and wants to be a responsible provider for his family.  There are many admirable qualities about the type of man Oscar Grant is trying to be, and Jordan undoubtedly has the acting tools necessary to bring the intensity and emotion to this character's tragic final moments.  It truly is a remarkable piece of acting by this young, talent actor.Several themes can be taken from the outcome of this film, most notably that people do have the power to change if their desire to do so is strong enough.  The importance of family and relationships are also focused upon heavily over the course of this film, as Jordan's character is portrayed as a loving father, flawed (yet devoted) boyfriend, a beloved friend, and caring son.  Along with the power of change and the importance of family, other notable themes, including responsibility and loyalty, both contribute to the heavy dose of underlying thematic elements within this film.  Additionally, it's quite possible the greatest message of them all in this film is that life is a gift and you never know when tragedy will take it away.  Life is to be cherished, and never taken for granted.First time director, Ryan Coogler, has an impressive debut on his hands, no doubt setting the bar rather high for his next endeavor.  The plot and characters mesh masterfully as the film operates with a smooth, continuous flow.  Coogler even incorporates a clever text message pop-up, which plays an integral part of the story (almost like a comic book balloon caption).  The pop-up idea truly is an act of sheer brilliance, which helps keeps the audience well informed with the information that comes and goes from Grant's cell phone over the course of his final day and night.  While Coogler clearly did his homework for the character, there is one scene in the film that has been admittedly incorporated as complete fiction - that being a scene where Grant befriends a dog while at a gas station.  Allegedly, the scene was used to simply fill a gap in the day for which Grant's activity were unaccounted.Overall, director Ryan Coogler and actor Michael B. Jordan collaborate for one of the best acted and most moving films of 2013.  It's completely understandable why this film received such a high amount of attention and praise at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.  However, it's unfortunate that it had to be over such a tragic event.  Still, the film pays homage to the loving memory of Oscar Grant.  Fruitvale Station portrays a sad, heartbreaking true story that ended with very little consequence.  While it's impossible to determine whether or not the police officer really did make a mistake by reaching for his gun instead of a Taser, a jury deemed that the officer made a mistake.  Sadly, it was an incident that cost a young man his life.  He was taken at such a young age, and unfortunately, no one will ever know what type of man Oscar Grant would have become had he not been tragically killed.GRADE: A-FNDNreview.com",5,Michael B.

The opening segment shows the amateur video clips of the New Year's Eve events that led to the death of the 22 year old victim so the viewer is prepared for the end of the story. As the film unfolds, the viewer begins to see Oscar as a person. It was at this point that I was not engaged in this film. The pace is slow, the cultural street dialogue difficult to understand, and the character relationships vague. We glimpse Oscar as a fired employee due to &#34;always being late&#34;, a devoted father, an attentive son, a loyal friend, and a compassionate human being. We also see Oscar as a small time drug dealer and a prison inmate. He has survived this far due to his charm, smile, and ability to land on his feet. He's not mean; his momma says &#34;he didn't like to be alone.&#34; During the last third of the movie, we see the fates converging. His momma must live with the guilt that she urged him &#34;to take the BART so he would be safe&#34; on New Years Eve. The film ends with a poignant scene in the emergency room waiting area.

The film is thankfully a low budget film  - a factor that gives it a better sense of credibility. The cast of characters is well chosen and knowing that the film is based on reality makes it all the more blisteringly difficult to watch.The story recreates (vividly, even though there is no actual written data about the lead-up to the infamous incident) the true story of Oscar (Michael B. Jordan), a 22-year-old Oakland resident who wakes up on the morning of December 31, 2008 with a sense of something ominous: he has cheated on his girlfriend Sophina (Melonie Diaz) and is confronted with his behavior, he has been lying about having a job (he was fired for being frequently late to work in a grocery), he needs money but can only get that through dealing drugs (he has been imprisoned in San Quentin earlier and relives that in a brief flashback), and he wants to make his mother Wanda (Octavia Spencer) have a happy birthday. He decides he wants to be a better son to his mother, a better partner to his girlfriend he has emotionally abused by his infidelity, and being a better father to T (Ariana Neal), their beautiful 4 year old daughter. He starts out well, but as the day goes on, he realizes that change is not going to come easy. He crosses paths with friends, family, and strangers, each exchange showing us that there is much more to Oscar than meets the eye. But it would be his final encounter of the day, with police officers at the Fruitvale BART station that would shake the Bay Area to its very core, and cause the entire nation to be witnesses to the story of the murder of Oscar Grant by a policeman who later is given only 11 months for involuntary manslaughter.The film is shot in verismo style that suits the story well. Most viewers will require subtitles as the accents of the cast mumble the dialogue that is appropriately filled with colloquialisms difficult to translate. This is a very disturbing film, highly original and one that deserves the honors bestowed upon it. Grady Harp, January 14",4,`I told him to catch the train. I told him to catch Bart!

It is a fantastic, sad movie that hits you in your gut.  ""Fruitvale Station  covers the last day in the life of a young African American man and is based on the true story of Oscar Grant III.  It is pretty much impossible to describe what happens in the film without giving away  the story. On the other hand, the case of Mr. Grant received wide spread publicity in this country in 2009 and the film opens with actual live footage of what took place from the cell phone of a bystander at the Fruitvale Station BART stop on that awful New Year's Eve.Michael B. Jordan as  Oscar and has said in interviews that he could have literally been the young  man he plays.  He gives a totally brilliant performance, creating a character that is in every sense of the word all too human. He is neither saint nor sinner. We understand that he may not have always remained faithful to his girl friend Sophina (played by Melonie Diaz) and mother of his daughter. He has spent some time in prison, and  has recently lost his job for being late too many times. He, however,  is a devoted, loving  father who adores his young beautiful daughter, is a dutiful son to his mother (Octavia Spencer recently seen in ""The Help"") and, portrayed by Mr. Jordan, is completely sympathetic.The film has many wonderful, touching moments: the scene with Oscar and the pit bull, the scene in the hospital when his mother-- surely both Mr. Jordan and Ms. Spencer will receive Oscar nominations-- offers up a prayer for her son (""We must lift Oscar up"") that comes close to making Christians out of all of us, the shot of her later slowly walking down the hospital corridor, her words that will tear your heart out-- ""he never liked being alone.""  It is difficult to believe that such a brilliant film as  ""Fruitvale Station"" is the first full length movie made by Mr. Coogler.That this movie was released just days after the verdict in the George Zimmerman murder trial in Florida and is  based on a true event  of course is just another poignant reminder of the continuing and never ending -- it seems-- struggle that young African American men face as they are perceived  and treated by  the police  in this country. I remember years ago when I taught in a  private black college in Florida having my eyes opened when I learned from my students that  every  black mother---particularly poor ones--  in this country has a fear that her son will wind up in prison. I do not believe that was the worry of poor white mothers, and certainly not those of the middle class, in the community where I grew up.This haunting film has opened to universal praise from the critics as well it should.",5,A Day in the Life of Oscar Grant III,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,2764,"['trying', 'adequately', 'describe', 'film', 'young', 'director', 'Ryan', 'Coogler', 'run', 'superlatives', 'fantastic', 'sad', 'movie', 'gut', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'last', 'day', 'life', 'young', 'African', 'American', 'man', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'III', 'pretty', 'much', 'impossible', 'describe', 'what', 'film', 'giving', 'away', 'story', 'other', 'hand', 'case', 'Mr.', 'Grant', 'received', 'wide', 'spread', 'publicity', 'country', '2009', 'film', 'actual', 'live', 'footage', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'cell', 'phone', 'bystander', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'BART', 'stop', 'awful', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve.Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'Oscar', 'said', 'interviews', 'could', 'have', 'literally', 'been', 'young', 'man', 'totally', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'creating', 'character', 'sense', 'word', 'too', 'human', 'saint', 'sinner', 'understand', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'always', 'remained', 'faithful', 'girl', 'friend', 'Sophina', 'played', 'Melonie', 'Diaz', 'mother', 'daughter', 'spent', 'time', 'prison', 'recently', 'lost', 'job', 'being', 'late', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'however', 'devoted', 'loving', 'father', 'who', 'young', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'dutiful', 'son', 'mother', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'recently', 'seen', 'Help', 'portrayed', 'Mr.', 'Jordan', 'completely', 'sympathetic.The', 'film', 'many', 'wonderful', 'touching', 'moments', 'scene', 'Oscar', 'pit', 'bull', 'scene', 'hospital', 'when', 'mother', 'surely', 'Mr.', 'Jordan', 'Ms.', 'Spencer', 'will', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'up', 'prayer', 'son', 'must', 'lift', 'Oscar', 'up', 'close', 'making', 'Christians', 'shot', 'later', 'slowly', 'walking', 'down', 'hospital', 'corridor', 'words', 'will', 'tear', 'heart', 'out', 'never', 'liked', 'being', 'alone', 'difficult', 'believe', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'first', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'made', 'Mr.', 'Coogler.That', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'just', 'days', 'verdict', 'George', 'Zimmerman', 'murder', 'trial', 'Florida', 'based', 'true', 'event', 'course', 'just', 'poignant', 'reminder', 'continuing', 'never', 'ending', 'struggle', 'young', 'African', 'American', 'men', 'face', 'are', 'perceived', 'treated', 'police', 'country', 'remember', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'taught', 'private', 'black', 'college', 'Florida', 'having', 'eyes', 'opened', 'when', 'learned', 'students', 'black', 'mother', '-particularly', 'poor', 'ones', 'country', 'fear', 'son', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'prison', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'was', 'worry', 'poor', 'white', 'mothers', 'certainly', 'not', 'middle', 'class', 'community', 'where', 'grew', 'up.This', 'haunting', 'film', 'opened', 'universal', 'praise', 'critics', 'well', 'should']",N/A

I really, really did NOT want to screen this movie because it's based on a true, news-making tragedy that took place in the Bay Area early in the morning of New Year's Day, 2009. Based on a script by writer/director Ryan Coogler, we follow Oscar Grant as he goes through December 31, 2008, the last day of his messed-up life.We see:* Michael B. Jordan (""Parenthood"" and ""Red Tails"") does a terrific job as Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old who has several things going on in his life: A mother who loves him; a girlfriend who is trying to forgive; a daughter he adores; the loss of his job; and rent that is due.* Melonie Diaz (Lots of TV) is Oscar's concerned fianc&eacute;e. She can see him clearly, but still loves him.* Ariana Neal (""Footloose"") is Oscar's daughter; she tries to talk him out of his New Year's party because she is afraid.* Octavia Spencer (""The Help"") is marvelous as Oscar's mother, who talks him into riding the train on New Year's Eve because he and his friends will be celebrating the holiday.* Chad Michael Murray (""One Tree Hill"") and Kevin Durand (""Lost"") as the transit officers who pull the trigger.My companion felt Oscar was really trying to turn his life around. His main motivation was his love for his family, which in turn made him reexamine his behavior. This still didn't dull his hair-trigger temper, but he seemed to be moving in the right direction.If there is a lesson here, it would be: Keep your life in order because you never know when it may end.Captions on the DVD from Amazon will be a big help.",3,Keep Your Life in Order,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,1615,"['Anyone', 'who', 'followed', 'news', '2009', 'already', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'BADLY', 'really', 'really', 'did', 'NOT', 'want', 'screen', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'news-making', 'tragedy', 'took', 'place', 'Bay', 'Area', 'early', 'morning', 'New', 'Year', 'Day', '2009', 'Based', 'script', 'writer/director', 'Ryan', 'Coogler', 'follow', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'December', '31', '2008', 'last', 'day', 'messed-up', 'life.We', 'see', '*', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'Parenthood', 'Red', 'Tails', 'terrific', 'job', 'Oscar', 'Grant', '22-year-old', 'who', 'several', 'things', 'going', 'life', 'mother', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'trying', 'forgive', 'daughter', 'loss', 'job', 'rent', 'due', '*', 'Melonie', 'Diaz', 'Lots', 'TV', 'Oscar', 'concerned', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'can', 'see', 'clearly', 'still', '*', 'Ariana', 'Neal', 'Footloose', 'Oscar', 'daughter', 'talk', 'New', 'Year', 'party', 'afraid', '*', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'Help', 'marvelous', 'Oscar', 'mother', 'who', 'riding', 'train', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'friends', 'will', 'be', 'celebrating', 'holiday', '*', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'Kevin', 'Durand', 'Lost', 'transit', 'officers', 'who', 'pull', 'trigger.My', 'companion', 'felt', 'Oscar', 'was', 'really', 'trying', 'turn', 'life', 'around', 'main', 'motivation', 'was', 'love', 'family', 'turn', 'made', 'reexamine', 'behavior', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'dull', 'hair-trigger', 'temper', 'seemed', 'be', 'moving', 'right', 'direction.If', 'lesson', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'Keep', 'life', 'order', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'may', 'end.Captions', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'will', 'be', 'big', 'help']",N/A

1663649,A36IHC0K68NS2,B00E1LQEFE,"Jeffrey N. Fritz ""Nikon Jeff""","[0, 1]","In 2009, we were living in the Bay Area. We remember the New Year's shooting of Oscar Grant, the trial, the resulting riots and the protests. We saw the cellphone video of the shooting on the local news. That made watching ""Fruitvale Station"" of greater interest and importance.The first question that must be asked about ""Fruitvale Station"" is who was Oscar Juliuss Grant III? And was his life significant enough to warrant a feature film?Certainly his death on New Years Day 2009 warrants a dramatic film, but It is hard to build a 85-minute move around a ten minute event. As a result, the film spends much of its time getting into Oscar Grant's background and the relation with his family. This is important to the story, but it sets a somewhat slow, laborious pace. Once you get to the Fruitvale station shooting and hospital scenes the movie becomes gripping and powerful. The ending is rather abrupt and unexpected, however the story has been completely told so a sharp ending to the film is not out of place.Ryan Coogler's script does a good job of telling Oscar Grant's story without taking sides. The script is well written profiling the story without showing bias. Yet it shows how prejudice and racial profiling can lead to dangerous conclusions. It also shows how circumstances and coincidences can play a major role in someone's life or even death.As portrayed in the film, Oscar Grant was a decent guy who was trying, albeit not very successfully, to take care of his family. He loved his mother and was devoted to his family, but tended to mess his life up through mistakes. He was neither a saint nor a monster.As for the film's quality, both the picture and the sound leave something to be desired. The image is soft and grainy, and that can be forgiven. This film was shot in Super 16 mm format and in documentary style and so low light, grainy film works. However the dialog is muffled and many of the limes are muttered making them hard to understand. This is one American film that needs English subtitles. Whether intended or not, the audio needs to have been recorded in a clearer fashion.The script jumps around a bit between 2009, 2008, 2007. The flashbacks are informative but also confusing and, as a result, there are no markers to understand the time line.On the DVD, you can exit out of the previews with the menu button. That's a nice feature as there are far too many DVD producers who lock you into watching each and every preview before you get to the feature itself.There is no director's commentary and only two special features. Both are worthwhile watching. One, ""Fruitvale Station: The Story of Oscar Grant"" is informative and interesting. The other special feature is an interview with the director, producers and cast that took place during the premier of the film on July 12, 2013. The interview has some of the same information that is in the first special feature. However it does go into far more depth about the circumstances around the situations that faced Oscar Grant and, later, Trayvon Martin.The film entertains but also gives pause for thought for how we see and understand one another. And that's a good thing for any feature film built around real life events.",4,"Well Written, Thought Provoking Film",1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,3216,"['2009', 'were', 'living', 'Bay', 'Area', 'remember', 'New', 'Year', 'shooting', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'trial', 'resulting', 'riots', 'protests', 'saw', 'cellphone', 'video', 'shooting', 'local', 'news', 'made', 'watching', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'greater', 'interest', 'importance.The', 'first', 'question', 'must', 'be', 'asked', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'who', 'was', 'Oscar', 'Juliuss', 'Grant', 'III', 'was', 'life', 'significant', 'enough', 'warrant', 'feature', 'film', 'Certainly', 'death', 'New', 'Years', 'Day', '2009', 'warrants', 'dramatic', 'film', 'hard', 'build', '85-minute', 'move', 'ten', 'minute', 'event', 'result', 'film', 'much', 'time', 'getting', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'background', 'relation', 'family', 'important', 'story', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'laborious', 'pace', 'Once', 'get', 'Fruitvale', 'station', 'shooting', 'hospital', 'scenes', 'movie', 'gripping', 'powerful', 'ending', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'unexpected', 'however', 'story', 'been', 'completely', 'told', 'so', 'sharp', 'ending', 'film', 'not', 'place.Ryan', 'Coogler', 'script', 'good', 'job', 'telling', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'story', 'taking', 'sides', 'script', 'well', 'written', 'profiling', 'story', 'showing', 'bias', 'how', 'prejudice', 'racial', 'profiling', 'can', 'lead', 'dangerous', 'conclusions', 'also', 'how', 'circumstances', 'coincidences', 'can', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'someone', 'life', 'even', 'death.As', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'was', 'decent', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'not', 'very', 'successfully', 'take', 'care', 'family', 'loved', 'mother', 'was', 'devoted', 'family', 'tended', 'mess', 'life', 'up', 'mistakes', 'was', 'saint', 'monster.As', 'film', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'leave', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'image', 'soft', 'grainy', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Super', '16', 'mm', 'format', 'documentary', 'style', 'so', 'low', 'light', 'grainy', 'film', 'works', 'However', 'dialog', 'muffled', 'many', 'limes', 'are', 'muttered', 'making', 'hard', 'understand', 'one', 'American', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Whether', 'intended', 'not', 'audio', 'have', 'been', 'recorded', 'clearer', 'fashion.The', 'script', 'jumps', 'bit', '2009', '2008', '2007', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'informative', 'also', 'confusing', 'result', 'are', 'markers', 'understand', 'time', 'DVD', 'can', 'exit', 'previews', 'menu', 'button', 'nice', 'feature', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'DVD', 'producers', 'who', 'lock', 'watching', 'preview', 'get', 'feature', 'director', 'commentary', 'only', 'two', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'watching', 'One', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'Story', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'informative', 'interesting', 'other', 'special', 'feature', 'interview', 'director', 'producers', 'cast', 'took', 'place', 'premier', 'film', 'July', '12', '2013', 'interview', 'same', 'information', 'first', 'special', 'feature', 'However', 'go', 'far', 'more', 'depth', 'circumstances', 'situations', 'faced', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'later', 'Trayvon', 'Martin.The', 'film', 'entertains', 'also', 'pause', 'thought', 'how', 'see', 'understand', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'feature', 'film', 'built', 'real', 'life', 'events']",N/A

The fact that it happened at all is disconcerting and it should make you angry. Increasingly acts of violence against people of color here in the US, even those acts committed by law enforcement, have no consequence or at least watered-down consequences for those who commit these acts. Fruitvale Station delineates the preceding 24 hours in the arc of the commission of one such act.When you really dig into what happened to Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager who was shot to death by someone who THOUGHT he was a bad guy... and got away with it with no penalty, you begin to realize there are two systems of justice in America: one for whites and one for people of color.Fruitvale Station opens with the actual video shot on a cellphone that shows what the police did in this instance.Michael B. Jordan portrays Oscar Grant and the role is a real step up in overall performance level as an actor. He's quite well known for his work in television series with recurring roles in The Wire, All My Children, and Friday Night Lights chief among them. As you watch this performance, it feels real. He gets us to understand that people are NOT created equal... at least not here in America.Ryan Coogler is a first time director here and the spare screenplay (in most scenes, there's plenty of breathing room between the segments of dialogue), very sharp direction, and the quality of the performances he elicits from his cast belie that fact. This is one marvelous directorial effort from first frame to last.This movie is an Oscar winner and is quite deserving of that honor. It is fascinating if not so enjoyable to watch.

Having won both the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, I was very excited to see it - and it was every bit as dramatic as I hoped it would be.  The film takes the point-of-view of Oscar Grant, a young man who was killed during an early-morning altercation with the police after celebrating the New Year.  The film is presented as a slice-of-life and depicts Oscar's final day - we see Oscar spend time with his family and friends, and we can also see some of his struggles and his aspirations to improve himself.  Throughout the entire movie you feel a dramatic weight that continues to build, until finally we reach the tragic conclusion to the day's events.The filmmaker, Ryan Coogler, is a first-time director... I am very much looking forward to his future projects.  He does an excellent job with the material, working with actor Michael B. Jordan to create a main character who has true complexity.  At times, you can see the limitations of the budget - there is a lot of handheld camera work, and the image looks as if it was captured on 16mm film.

If not, the film opens with hand-held footage showing exactly what is looming for Oscar Grant.As in &#34;Elephant,&#34; the film is less concerned with the specifics of the event than the rather ordinary day that leads up to it.  Ordinary in that Oscar is one of the most well rounded characters in recent cinema, and Michael B. Jordan is the reason to see this film.  Over the course of the day, we see Oscar intimidating a co-worker, attempting to cheat on his long-term girlfriend, lovingly caring for his daughter, trying to organize a family gathering and fighting with belligerent drunks on a train.Oscar isn't a saint or a villian, he's a complex person navigating the different roles he must play during the day: partner/boyfriend, father, tough guy with friends, sensitive guy with girls.  One of the most complex moments is when he pauses to care for a dog that has been hit by a car.  He calls for help; none comes.  He strokes the dog as it whimpers.  He waits as it dies.

1663658,A3BAE79NXFDXGV,B00E1LQEFE,"Joseph P. Ulibas ""Captain Couth""","[0, 0]","Fruitvale Station is a film that is based upon the true story of Oscar Grant III and his death at the hands of a BART Police Officer.  Oscar Grant (Michael B. Jordan) is a young man who's trying to get his life together.  He has a daughter named Tatiana (Ariana Neal) and loving girlfriend Sophina (Melonie Diaz).  Grant has a troubled past but he's trying to make the right decisions and make a better life for his family.  It's New Year's Eve and after they celebrate his mother's (Octavia Spencer) birthday, Grant and Sophina are going to head to the city to watch the New Year's fireworks.  On the train ride home, Grant's street life catches up with him and after a spat with a local rival causes a fight.  The BART police break it up and sets off a chain reaction that brings this young man's life to an end.I really enjoyed the movie.  A very brilliant debut picture for director Ryan Cooglar.  Kudos also go to Michael B. Jordan who portrayed Oscar Grant.  His acting gave the role a realistic aura to it that showed what a complex person Grant was a I feel that a very few people could have pulled it off.  I really enjoyed the direction of the film, especially the last act of the film.  It was pretty intense and heart wrenching.  I hope to see more films from Cooglar in the future and more of Michael B. Jordan.The DVD is presented in 5.1 English and 5.1 in a Spanish dub.  There are two featurettes that accompany the film in the bonus section.

Not only that, I did not expect Michael B. Jordan to be playing the lead character. I have the movie Chronicle, and not only did I enjoy that particular movie, but I really admired his performance. But even then, I was sort of unfamiliar with his work as an actor. But just today after viewing Fruitvale Station for the first time, Michael B Jordan not only took me by storm, he took the ENTIRE audience by storm.Michael B Jordan plays Oscar Grant, and as I already stated his performance was absolutely terrific. When you sit down to watch this movie, and you are introduced to his character, you understand immediately what is going on here. The movie is not just about what happened that fateful night, but it shows that a person can take all the negative that may be in his or her life and make it positive for the better. Great job here; I expect a nomination.Supporting cast includes Octavia Spencer( you may remember her as Minny in the movie The Help) as Oscar's mother Wanda, Melonie Diaz as Sophina Oscar's girlfriend. Also Starring in this movie are Chad Michael Murray, and Kevin Durand as the two police officers. The Whole cast was gave passionate, memorable performances.Did I cry watching this movie? Well I will say that I was able to hold back my tears during several moments; but it was very hard.I really admired this movie; not only that, I have a new found respect for Michael B Jordan as an actor. This guy can Seriously act. Hats off to up and coming director Ryan Coogler as well. His heart and mind was definitely in the right place in making this movie. The whole set design and layout, and overall atmosphere that Fruitvale Station has makes this movie not only one of the best movies of the Summer but one of the best overall films of the year. First it was Silver Linings Playbook, last year and this year The Weinstein movie company continues to be on a unstoppable roll. And with that being said, the 2014 Academy Awards have a serious Best Actor contender and an even more serious Best Picture contender for this movie right here.

I was not disappointed.  Michael B. Jordan is superb, as is Octavia Spencer.

1663661,A1VOPP2OFITP7D,B00E1LQEFE,June Bug,"[4, 9]","Another young black man unfortunately dead.  History repeats itself, however, many of movies that are ""based on a true story"" as this is have a tendency to manipulate the actual events for many different reasons - to gain support for the person ""wronged""; to push a political agenda; to change public opinion; to make the story more interesting; to gain attention for those involved in its production; to get greater distribution; make more money; and I'm sure many other reasons I haven't considered.  It appears to me that at least some of these agenda's are in play in the movie called ""Fruitvale Station"".This movie portrays Oscar Grant as a young man of 22 trying to find his way.  We think the movie is accurate because it reveals his character flaws.  He was victimized by an unjust system repeatedly and the present state of the inner city plight is again repeated.  The problem is that critical facts are missing that translate into a clear misrepresentation of that fateful day.The movie starts early morning, December 31, 2008.  His girlfriend and baby mama comments about her recent discovery of his infidelity, he assures her of his commitment to her.  Initially, she is portrayed as ambivalent about his drug dealing.  After she leaves for work, he visits a supermarket and asks for his job back (we were led to believe he was working) but the manager refuses, Oscar's temper gets the best of him and he threatens his former boss repeatedly.  Moments earlier, he initiates a conversation with an attractive woman in the store and hits on her, this is just a few short hours after promising his girlfriend that he only wants her ""forever"".  Later we see him making a call to a client to set a meeting.  While waiting at the ocean for the client, he throws away a substantial bag ~32 oz. of what appears to be pot into the water, as he reflects on his prison stay (he had been out of jail for four months).  Yet, when his client shows, he sells him something else. Throughout the day, he talks to various family members, lying to them directly about having the day off (no one knows he was terminated).  Later, he admits to his girlfriend that he has been unemployed and the rent is due, she forgives him and reminds him of his drugs as a resource.  She becomes angry at him for throwing away the pot.Shortly after threatening his former boss with physical harm, he cries over a dog, who after getting hit by a car quickly dies.  He shouts at the driver who speeds away.  In essence, he is a poor black man, a victim with little economic opportunity struggling to survive and so we are to forgive him his flaws.  We see flashbacks of his stint in prison during his pot disposal and we are to believe Oscar is maturing and has every intention to become a good citizen (but moments later he completes a drug deal!?).The fact is that the writer admits to making up the dog scene (see Forbes article) as well as the scene where Oscar tosses the dope.  In fact, Oscar was a known drug dealer in the area (which is slightly alluded to, you aren't sure).  Of course, his flaws don't justify the fact that he was murdered in cold blood, a victim of stereotyping.However, when he and his friends are riding the BART subway train (San Francisco's mass transit) returning from seeing the New Year's Eve fireworks, he along some of these friends get involved in an altercation (all have been drinking -we suspect some may be doing drugs as well), the BART (train) officers are called, he and two others are told to sit while the cops collect the other fight participants.  The three become quite vocal and are argumentative and attempt to leave.  Meanwhile, multiple riders are shouting at the police and general chaos ensues.  A gun is fired and you realize he has been shot by an officer.  He is rushed to the hospital for extremely serious injuries, he dies hours later.  The movie closes.We, the audience are informed that the officer stated he had intended to taser him but grabbed his gun by accident -implying that it wasn't an accident particularly at the close, instead it was racially motivated homicide.  The officer was charged by the jury for 1st degree manslaughter.  Your initial reaction is horror at this injustice with great compassion and anger for his family and friends' loss.Here are some critical facts that challenge the ""truthfulness"" in the presentation of the events.  These include the following omissions:  multiple videos were taken during the incident, Grant refused to comply with being handcuffed and attempted to get way, when Pirone instructed Officer Mehserle to arrest Grant (among the phone videos, we see the four other men were compliant and two were hand-cuffed); it appears that Grant attempted to get Officer Pirone's gun when Pirone made an attempt to handcuff him, at which point, Pirone assaulted him; the autopsy showed his blood alcohol level was (0.02%) and there was Fentanyl, a potent pain reliever also in his system (so much for turning away from his life of crime); Other officer's reported that the group was aggressive and threatening; BART dismissed Pirone and his partner, Marysol Domenici, BART stated Domenici had given ""false statements"" which was proved a lie and she was reinstated including back pay; a witness, Carlos Reyes gave witness testimony at trial stating that Officer Mehserle said, ""Oh s***, I shot him"" after shooting Grant; moments earlier, Mehserle had been on a call dealing with a hoodlum, who was armed and resisted arrest by running away (this was mentioned at the trial, to give insight into his the state of mind, prior to dealing with Grant and the others).If this were true story then these facts as they relate to the event should have been presented as well - I guess that is why it wasn't presented in a documentary format and only based on a true story.  It reminds me of the pre-school game where someone whispers a sentence which gets passed along a chain.  Fifteen people later, the sentence is wildly different.After the jury verdict that were multiple protests, some of which were violent, and crimes of aggression which included arson, vandalism and theft.  The jury didn't believe he was intentionally shot in cold blood.  Unfortunately, Oscar was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  He shouldn't have been involved in a fight at 2AM on a subway under the influence of substantial alcohol and pain killers.After watching footage from multiple videos taken during this time, it would appear that Officer Pirone was aggressive but it is obvious that out of the five men in the group, Grant was the only one, resisting the officers, his body language is clear.  It is unfortunate that there was no audio.  One can understand that the officer's would be concerned when anyone resists arrest (regardless of complexion) and that the elevated adrenaline makes one highly responsive because Oscar was actively resisting them.  We don't know Oscar's state of mind given amount and combined effect of the drug and alcohol in his system but his behavior is combative.  Officer Mehserle looks stunned as realization that he shot his weapon becomes evident -if he had shot intentionally as multiple blogs suggest, would that have been his expression?Meanwhile, Pirone was fired from his job but it doesn't appear that he is restricted from being a police officer, he is not mentioned in the end summary.  I am concerned he was not stripped of his law enforcement credentials.I'm not denying that racism exists especially among police officers.  Sadly, it is prevalent in the large metropolitan area in which I reside.  I have black friends that won't drive in certain communities because DWB (Driving While Black). I have heard police in my town say racist things, this appalls me.Additionally, I can think of multiple incidents where area police have gone to the wrong house and shot a supposed drug dealer.  Why aren't films or documentaries made about these common, Joe the plumber types mistakenly being killed?  Is it because most of those victims are Caucasian or Hispanic?It is unfortunate that perhaps multiple misunderstandings occurred leading to the death of Oscar Grant.  A family is without their brother, parent's are without their son, a child is without her father, a woman is without her man but to paint him as a saint, whose halo was a bit tilted is a big stretch!  Particularly, when the movie turns this into a race issue.  There is no question that police profile people and that black men are especially targeted for unfair treatment in the justice system ( a great documentary on this issue has been done, ""The House I Live In"", its focus is about the unfair treatment of crack users (popular among the poor, particularly black community) compared to cocaine users (wealthy, typically Caucasian crowd))-please see my review.  It is unfortunate that the writer and producers made the choice of picking Oscar Grant as the poster ""child"" for racist police brutality.  Moreover, by choosing to portray Oscar in this light is almost excusing his drug dealing activities, stereotyping him as having no other options.  This is an injustice to black people, who choose to do honest work.  Being poor is not justification to turning to crime, while some choose to commit crime, others choose to work even if it isn't a career or a good use of their talents.  There are people of all races that face poverty.That aside, I thought the acting was fair and the writing poor.  Octavia Spencer is a great actress and even she didn't come across as believable in the last scene.I can't recommend this.  I feel duped, I spent about 3 hours researching the story for the facts.",2,Controversy...movie deviates from critical points from actual events,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,9670,"['young', 'black',

1663662,A3HOBP97RKKY0M,B00E1LQEFE,J. Wiles Parker,"[0, 0]","Fruitvale Station is based on the true story of 22 year old Oscar Grant who was murdered in the early hours of New Year's Day 2009.  The movie begins with some of the actual footage filmed by a passenger on the Bay Area Rapid Transit when Grant and his buddies were hauled off the train.  Knowing what's coming makes this sometimes a difficult film to watch as the focus shifts backward to the previous day's events that lead to what ultimately is a tragedy.  While it's true that we cannot know for certain how much of what's in the film actually happened, we do know that the climax did of the action did and that makes it worth watching.Oscar is played brilliantly by rising star Michael B. Jordan.  Oscar isn't perfect and his problems are as much a part of the story as the actual events leading up to his shooting.  The focus is very much on Oscar and his struggles with trying to be a better person and family man while still trying to remain true to himself.  What makes the film great is that, even knowing what is to come, Oscar is trying to better himself and to make good decisions.  It's these decisions that also make the movie so difficult to take come the end.  Despite all that and thanks to the short run time (less than and hour and a half) the film weaves through Oscar's final days and what led him there without be dragged down.  This is not only good storytelling and acting, it is the type of movie that sticks with you because it makes you realize that you cannot see your own end.  Look for moving performances from Octavia Spencer as Oscar's mother and Melonie Diaz as his girlfriend because they anchor the story and the tragedy and frame a human response.Sometimes difficult to watch but certainly worth the time, Fruitvale Station will leave you wishing the inevitable ending was different.

Too many incidents like this happen--it becomes hard to keep them straight.  Most often we hear about them for one or two days in the news, and then they vanish.This is a &#34;docu-drama&#34;--a portrayal of the events that led to the unjustified shooting of a young black man at a BART station early on New Year's Day.  As such, it sounds like it will be highly polemic, or very depressing.  I found it not exactly either one.  The script writing and direction and acting realistically depicted a few days in the life of a young black man, his girlfriend and children, his family and friends, over the course of a couple days leading up to and including the shooting.  It was sensitively done, not over-romanticizing the character and making him out to be a saint, but very briefly depicting some prior run-ins with the law, resulting in several arrests and at least one prison term before he was even 22 years old.  Nevertheless, it shows he was really struggling to avoid falling back into bad habits: to be a better father, son, boyfriend, hopefully husband, and to find honest employment.  If the movie falls down in any area, it would be a relative lack of analysis of the macroeconomic trends in our country, creating a class of permanently unemployed [or else, illegally-employed]-- mainly for those without the right education or the right job-skills; especially those living in blighted city-environments where jobs are hard to find, hard to keep, and don't pay enough to support a family; especially for young people; especially for young males; especially for young males of color.  But that was not the intent of this movie.  The intent was to personalize this problem: as experienced by Oscar Grant, by his girlfriend, his daughter, his mother and his friends.  Although their parts were performed by actors, at the very end of the film we very briefly see the scene of a protest at the location where he was shot, which includes the real mother, the real daughter, and other grieving family members.  This was both a very personal, and a universal tragedy, unfortunately.

1663668,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00E1LQEFE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","The debut feature from writer/director Ryan Coogler, ""Fruitvale Station,"" was one of the most critically lauded films of 2013.  For some reason, though, I was wary of rushing right out to see it.  Now that I've had a chance to catch up with this tight and effective little film, I want to pay it (and Coogler) an enormous compliment.  ""Fruitvale Station"" is a powerful examination of a true life tragedy.  That isn't what makes it a great movie though.  Although the subject matter is weighty, unpleasant, and important, Coogler has shown great restraint in story telling.  In other hands, this movie might have made an overwrought political statement--letting issues and debate outshine personal drama.  Instead, Coogler's film showcases an ordinary life cut short.  Its hero is neither a saint nor a villain, but a regular guy just trying to make the right choices.  The film's screenplay doesn't ask that you accept its subject as anyone other than who he was.  And he was Oscar Grant III.  Grant might have made some questionable choices in his short life, but that doesn't make what happened to him any less tragic.""Fruitvale Station"" takes a minimal approach, adding to the gut wrenching realism.  This is just a day in the life of Oscar Grant.  Unfortunately, though, it is his last.  And in his final day on earth, Grant didn't do anything spectacular.  The day was filled with the usual ups and downs, nice moments and disappointments as well.  The 22-year old Bay Area resident was trying to keep his daughter happy, make a nice birthday for his mother, and enjoy a New Years celebration in San Francisco.  He was also struggling with lost employment and trying to distance himself from dealing.  An altercation with transit cops, however, proved to be fatal.  The actual case got nationwide attention as the events were recorded by many of the witnesses.  And in a bold choice, Coogler uses actual footage of the event in opening the movie. While I might be concerned about using this as an exploitative filmmaking choice, here it strengthens the abject horror of this completely unnecessary and unjust death.""Fruitvale Station"" achieves its power from its simplicity.  It doesn't judge what happens, just lays it out for you to make your own determinations.  Michael B. Jordan serves a multi-layered performance as Grant, proving he is one to really watch!  Provided he keep choosing the right material (sadly, his next major role was in That Awkward Moment), he has the potential to do great things.  Melonie Diaz and Octavia Spencer also make a strong impact as the women in Grant's life.  Spencer, in particular, as Grant's mother has limited screen time but has such an assured dignity that it takes over her scenes.  At a tight ninety minutes, ""Fruitvale Station"" really resonates from an emotional place.  Having seen the film about a month ago, I have thought back on the experience many times.  That's saying a lot in these days when most movies are so easily forgettable.  A simple filmic structure makes you feel like a fly-on-the-wall in the last moments of Oscar Grant's life.  And by choosing to be understated, the film soars to unexpected depths.

This makes for a great film. (I have not checked how much of the film is true or fiction. This is a review of the film itself.) It is an interesting peak into a life as it proceeds towards a disastrous end.",5,Well Presented Slice of Life Flashback,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,970,"['Fruitvale', 'Station', 'film', 'something', 'difficult', 'film', 'gripping', 'story', 'where', 'audience', 'how', 'movie', 'will', 'end', 'Indeed', 'film', 'scene', 'Bay', 'Area', 'Transit', 'Police', 'shooting', 'main', 'character', 'dead', 'Viewers', 'then', 'see', 'actors', 'presenting', 'flashback', 'final', 'day', 'life', 'man', 'unaware', 'demise', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'risky', 'route', 'showing', 'something', 'negative', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'beginning', 'course', 'film', 'see', 'complicated', 'caring', 'person', 'see', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'who', 'people', 'who', 'nice', 'things', 'who', 'flaws', 'interesting', 'arc', 'where', 'characters', 'seen', 'previously', 'reemerge', 'critical', 'moments', 'great', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'checked', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'true', 'fiction', 'review', 'film', 'interesting', 'peak', 'life', 'towards', 'disastrous', 'end']",N/A
1663673,A2OKRGHIYTBQ6P,B00E1LQEFE,"Lewis A. Edge Jr. ""Happy Traveler""","[0, 0]","As the first major project for a newly graduated director, Ryan Coogler, and supported by Forest Whitaker's production company, this movie explores the life of Oscar Grant III, a 22-year-old man from Hayward, California leading up to his death at the hands of a police officer in the Fruitvale BART station.  Although I felt that this move got off to a slow start, the pace picked up in the second half and delivered some compelling and powerful messages.  I felt also that this movie deserved the critical acclaim that it has received.Oscar Grant, III is skillfully portrayed by Michael B. Jordan who reenacts the goodness, anger and character flaws of Grant, who had been imprisoned for felony drug dealing, had been previously arrested for illegal possession of a handgun, had bouts of violence, cheated on his girlfriend, lost his job due to chronic lateness, yet was incredibly loving to his young daughter and could display an almost magnetic charm.  For anyone who has followed the news reports about Grant's tragic and senseless death on January 1, 2009, the ending was predictable; in fact the ending is shown at the onset of the movie.Some of the facts were omitted and embellished, perhaps to make the movie and its lead character more endearing and interesting, but the lunacy and tragedy of what happened at Fruitvale Station on that fateful night was abundantly clear.  The elements that led to that horrible event and the resultant grief from it can be observed as a lesson to all who may be involved in something like it.  Maybe some future tragedies can be avoided if the messages from this movie are heeded.",4,"Delivers Compelling, Powerful Messages",1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,1625,"['first', 'major', 'project', 'newly', 'graduated', 'director', 'Ryan', 'Coogler', 'supported', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'production', 'company', 'movie', 'life', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'III', '22-year-old', 'man', 'Hayward', 'California', 'leading', 'up', 'death', 'hands', 'police', 'officer', 'Fruitvale', 'BART', 'station', 'felt', 'move', 'got', 'off', 'slow', 'start', 'pace', 'picked', 'up', 'second', 'half', 'delivered', 'compelling', 'powerful', 'messages', 'felt', 'also', 'movie', 'deserved', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'received.Oscar', 'Grant', 'III', 'skillfully', 'portrayed', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'who', 'goodness', 'anger', 'character', 'flaws', 'Grant', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'imprisoned', 'felony', 'drug', 'dealing', 'had', 'been', 'previously', 'arrested', 'illegal', 'possession', 'handgun', 'had', 'bouts', 'violence', 'cheated', 'girlfriend', 'lost', 'job', 'due', 'chronic', 'lateness', 'was', 'incredibly', 'loving', 'young', 'daughter', 'could', 'display', 'almost', 'magnetic', 'charm', 'anyone', 'who', 'followed', 'news', 'reports', 'Grant', 'tragic', 'senseless', 'death', 'January', '1', '2009', 'ending', 'was', 'predictable', 'fact', 'ending', 'shown', 'onset', 'movie.Some', 'facts', 'were', 'omitted', 'embellished', 'perhaps', 'make', 'movie', 'lead', 'character', 'more', 'endearing', 'interesting', 'lunacy', 'tragedy', 'what', 'happened', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'fateful', 'night', 'was', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'elements', 'led', 'horrible', 'event', 'resultant', 'grief', 'can', 'be', 'observed', 'lesson', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'involved', 'something', 'Maybe', 'future', 'tragedies', 'can', 'be', 'avoided', 'messages', 'movie', 'are', 'heeded']",N/A

1663676,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B00E1LQEFE,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[19, 24]","Living in the Bay area one could not have avoided the story of Oscar Grant, and his totally unnecessary tragedy.The story of him being shot by a BART police officer while face down on the ground at an Oakland BART station, on New Years day 2009 sparked a series of riots there.Happily, a movie has been made which brings the situation more fully to light, and it raises questions about, for example, profiling, civil rights for black people, and the simple issue of justice.  Around the same time the movie was released the George Zimmerman trial was in progress and decided. The acquittal of George Zimmerman on the grounds of self defense in the slaying of Trayvon Martin sparked outrage, and national protest.  Unfortunately, one of those protests was in Oakland where there was property damage and injuries inflicted on innocent people.May I say, the movie does not start out promising, it is low budget, and looks it, however as it went along I was totally transported by it knowing its dreadful end.  Some of the storytelling elements are clunky and obviously manipulative.  Undoubtedly, this was done to make the character look more sympathetic, but the story could have achieved the same effect with less manipulation.Told in a non linear fashion we are not always sure where we are in the scheme of things.  Oscars has faults, and the movie does not attempt to hide them.  If it played up only those faults, there would be a danger of stereotyping.  Go too far the other way and it's manipulative.  Yes, he had substance issues, yes he did time, yes he lost his job because he was unreliable.  But these are not the only things that define a character.  The director has to tread carefully in depicting a real persons tragedy both to honor Oscar Grant, and to not further wound an already hurting family and community.I felt a few things were overboard.  Visiting a store, he sees a white woman buying fish for a party, and he calls his grandmother to ask her advice, and then puts the woman on the phone to her.  He sees a dog injured in a hit and run at the side of the road, and cares for it.What is compelling though is Octavia Spensers performance as his mother.  Surely, this is deserving of at east an Oscar nomination if not the Oscar itself.  Here is a very topical theme, in which there is enormous public interest.As for Oscar himself, it does not matter what his record is, he was an innocent person returning to Oakland having spent New Years Evening in San Francisco.  He did nothing to deserve that fate.  There was no reason why one should draw a weapon and fire it on someone lying face down.  The policeman Mehserle said he mistook his gun for a tazer.  But why even pull a tazer when someone is already handcuffed?I have to admit that certain scenes in the movie were very powerful, towards the end, where Octavia Spenser playing the mother really excelled, and it's through her performance and the performance of the girlfriend and how they respond that we get the sense of the true tragedy of Oscar Grant.Mehserle was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and is currently free, and the family settled a $28 million lawsuit against the city for $2.8 million.I found this movie to be emotionally powerful, and moving, and a very important movie to see.  A few years a movie about race relations called Crash won the Academy Award for best Picture, and I hope that this movie will be fully recognised for it's timeliness and its contribution to the ongoing narrative.  And let's not forget Oscar.Given its emotional weight it is not a movie I would recommend for everyone.  If the subject matter interest you I think you will find it to be powerful. I think you will like and I hope this was helpful.",4,A small but very important movie,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,3732,"['Living', 'Bay', 'area', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'avoided', 'story', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'tragedy.The', 'story', 'being', 'shot', 'BART', 'police', 'officer', 'face', 'down', 'ground', 'Oakland', 'BART', 'station', 'New', 'Years', 'day', '2009', 'sparked', 'series', 'riots', 'there.Happily', 'movie', 'been', 'made', 'situation', 'more', 'fully', 'light', 'questions', 'example', 'profiling', 'civil', 'rights', 'black', 'people', 'simple', 'issue', 'justice', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'George', 'Zimmerman', 'trial', 'was', 'progress', 'decided', 'acquittal', 'George', 'Zimmerman', 'grounds', 'self', 'defense', 'slaying', 'Trayvon', 'Martin', 'sparked', 'outrage', 'national', 'protest', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'protests', 'was', 'Oakland', 'where', 'was', 'property', 'damage', 'injuries', 'inflicted', 'innocent', 'people.May', 'say', 'movie', 'not', 'start', 'out', 'promising', 'low', 'budget', 'however', 'went', 'was', 'totally', 'transported', 'knowing', 'dreadful', 'end', 'storytelling', 'elements', 'are', 'clunky', 'obviously', 'manipulative', 'Undoubtedly', 'was', 'done', 'make', 'character', 'look', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'achieved', 'same', 'effect', 'less', 'manipulation.Told', 'non', 'linear', 'fashion', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'sure', 'where', 'are', 'scheme', 'things', 'Oscars', 'faults', 'movie', 'not', 'attempt', 'hide', 'played', 'up', 'only', 'faults', 'would', 'be', 'danger', 'stereotyping', 'Go', 'too', 'far', 'other', 'way', 'manipulative', 'Yes', 'had', 'substance', 'issues', 'did', 'time', 'yes', 'lost', 'job', 'was', 'unreliable', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'things', 'define', 'character', 'director', 'tread', 'carefully', 'depicting', 'real', 'persons', 'tragedy', 'honor', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'not', 'further', 'wound', 'already', 'hurting', 'family', 'community.I', 'felt', 'few', 'things', 'were', 'overboard', 'Visiting', 'store', 'white', 'woman', 'buying', 'fish', 'party', 'grandmother', 'ask', 'advice', 'then', 'woman', 'phone', 'dog', 'injured', 'hit', 'run', 'side', 'road', 'cares', 'compelling', 'Octavia', 'Spensers', 'performance', 'mother', 'Surely', 'deserving', 'east', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'not', 'Oscar', 'Here', 'very', 'topical', 'theme', 'enormous', 'public', 'interest.As', 'Oscar', 'not', 'matter', 'what', 'record', 'was', 'innocent', 'person', 'returning', 'Oakland', 'having', 'spent', 'New', 'Years', 'Evening', 'San', 'Francisco', 'did', 'nothing', 'deserve', 'fate', 'was', 'reason', 'why', 'one', 'should', 'draw', 'weapon', 'fire', 'someone', 'lying', 'face', 'down', 'policeman', 'Mehserle', 'said', 'mistook', 'gun', 'tazer', 'why', 'even', 'pull', 'tazer', 'when', 'someone', 'already', 'handcuffed', 'have', 'admit', 'certain', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'powerful', 'end', 'where', 'Octavia', 'Spenser', 'playing', 'mother', 'really', 'excelled', 'performance', 'performance', 'girlfriend', 'how', 'respond', 'get', 'sense', 'true', 'tragedy', 'Oscar', 'Grant.Mehserle', 'was', 'found', 'guilty', 'involuntary', 'manslaughter', 'currently', 'free', 'family', 'settled', '28', 'million', 'lawsuit', 'city', '2.8', 'million.I', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'moving', 'very', 'important', 'movie', 'see', 'few', 'years', 'movie', 'race', 'relations', 'called', 'Crash', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'Picture', 'hope', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'fully', 'recognised', 'timeliness', 'contribution', 'ongoing', 'narrative', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Oscar.Given', 'emotional', 'weight', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'subject', 'matter', 'interest', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'powerful', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",N/A

1663683,ADTUS88NFTW23,B00E1LQEFE,"Melkor ""dark lord""","[0, 0]","""Fruitvale Station"" is a dramatization of the day that led up to the shooting of Oscar Grant III, a 22 year old young man, by police officers New Year's Day in 2009.  The movie does not try to paint Mr. Grant as a saint.  He is an ex-con who can't hold a job, has issues with drugs and struggles with his relationship.  At the same time, like any multifaceted person, he cares for his family and is trying to do right by the hand dealt him.There is a fine line between holding a person responsible for their actions and blaming society for the person being put in unreasonable circumstances in the first place.  I think ""Fruitvale Station"" does a good job of not really diving into that argument.  Rather, the film simply says, ""this is who Oscar Grant is on this particular day"".A possible criticism of the film is that it does not give equal time to the police perspective.  This argument is irrelevant.  First of all, we have the actual footage of all the onlookers which show exactly how the police overreacted and mishandled the situation.  The shooting of this young man was inexcusable and, speaking as a person who grew up in the Bay Area, this continues the long tradition of brutal, corrupt, and racist behavior by the police in the Bay Area (anyone remember Mayor Moscone and Harvey Milk?).  There is no ""other side"" or ""other perspective"", the death of this young man was inexcusable.One criticism that I will agree with is that the filmmakers do err in possibly going a little overboard to make the character likable, such as having him cry over a dog that was hit by a car or choosing that day to give up dealing drugs.  Those feel like forced decisions to garner sympathy.  If they were meant to be symbolic, it felt rather ham-handed.  The audience doesn't need situations like that to make us like the character.  Even if Grant was a complete scumbag (we only know what the film presents us in one day), that does not change the issue that he did not need to die.",4,a wonderful film,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,1980,"['Fruitvale', 'Station', 'dramatization', 'day', 'led', 'up', 'shooting', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'III', '22', 'year', 'old', 'young', 'man', 'police', 'officers', 'New', 'Year', 'Day', '2009', 'movie', 'not', 'try', 'paint', 'Mr.', 'Grant', 'saint', 'ex-con', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'job', 'issues', 'drugs', 'struggles', 'relationship', 'same', 'time', 'multifaceted', 'person', 'family', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'hand', 'dealt', 'fine', 'line', 'holding', 'person', 'responsible', 'actions', 'blaming', 'society', 'person', 'being', 'put', 'unreasonable', 'circumstances', 'first', 'place', 'think', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'really', 'diving', 'argument', 'film', 'simply', 'who', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'particular', 'day', 'possible', 'criticism', 'film', 'not', 'give', 'equal', 'time', 'police', 'perspective', 'argument', 'irrelevant', 'First', 'all', 'have', 'actual', 'footage', 'onlookers', 'show', 'exactly', 'how', 'police', 'overreacted', 'mishandled', 'situation', 'shooting', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'inexcusable', 'speaking', 'person', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Bay', 'Area', 'long', 'tradition', 'brutal', 'corrupt', 'racist', 'behavior', 'police', 'Bay', 'Area', 'anyone', 'remember', 'Mayor', 'Moscone', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'other', 'side', 'other', 'perspective', 'death', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'inexcusable.One', 'criticism', 'will', 'agree', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'err', 'possibly', 'going', 'little', 'overboard', 'make', 'character', 'likable', 'such', 'having', 'cry', 'dog', 'was', 'hit', 'car', 'choosing', 'day', 'give', 'up', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'feel', 'forced', 'decisions', 'garner', 'sympathy', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'symbolic', 'felt', 'rather', 'ham-handed', 'audience', ""n't"", 'need', 'situations', 'make', 'character', 'Even', 'Grant', 'was', 'complete', 'scumbag', 'only', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'one', 'day', 'not', 'change', 'issue', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'die']",N/A

1663690,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00E1LQEFE,M. Oleson,"[1, 3]","Theatrical review.Director and writer Ryan Coogler walks us patiently through the last day of 22 year old Oscar Grant. On New Year's Day, 2009 Grant was shot in the back by a BART policeman while lying on the ground.Portrayed with a mix of grace and anger by rising star Michael B. Jordan, Grant wasn't perfect.  He did a stint in prison (shown in flashback) for dealing drugs, and in several scenes we see he has a short fuse.  He wakes up on December 31 and decides his life of drug dealing is over and tries to get his job in a grocery store back after being fired for being tardy numerous times.  He doesn't but he still plans to walk the straight and narrow, primarily for the benefit of his 4 year old daughter, her mother and girlfriend Sophina (Melonie Diaz) and his mother (another award worthy performance by Octavia Spencer).Coogler sees Grant as a good father who loves his daughter and wants to improve his relationships with Sophina and his mother.  I couldn't help but wonder, is this man really that nice a guy?  I don't know.  Grant and Sophina are headed across the Bay to San Francisco with their friends.  Wanda (Spencer) suggests they take the train so they can drink without worrying about driving home.  Again, Coogler seems to drive this point home as if to attach the blame to Wanda.This event was played out in the press so the story is well known.  In fact, Coogler shows real footage at the beginning of the movie, which caused a shriek or two in the theater I was in.  A couple women even walked out at the end of the movie when the murder was reenacted.  It is hard to watch and for many, hard to fathom.  Unfortunately we see similar tragedies all too often.This is an excellent film, with some quality acting.  At first I was a bit put off by the use of hand-held cameras but after a while the film takes on an almost documentary style, which I suspect was the idea.

After that, the events of the last 24 hrs. unfold, and  we first see Oscar and his girlfriend Sophina arguing, as Sophina found out he had cheated on her. Later on we als learn some other less rozy things about Oscar (jail time a few years back for reasons not mentioned, although probably drug dealing; just recently losing his job at a local grocery store for tardiness; etc.). So Oscar is not the immediately likeable character or innocent angel. Yet as that 31st December unfolds, we also see Oscar being close to his young daughter, being kind to his ""momma"" and his ""grandma"", and his close friends, and deciding to make things better in his life. Not much really ""happens"". The last 20-25 min. retell the events of what happened in the train ride and at Fruitvale Station, and also the aftermath. Let me be upfront: even though we already know how it all is going to turn out, I was STILL shocked, and upset, and moved to tears.Couple of comments: this movie made a huge splash when it was first shown at the 2013 Sundance film festival, and with good reason. Kudos to first time writer-director Ryan Coogler for an outstanding delivery on all levels. Also noteworthy is the performance of Michael B. Jordan as Oscar. Jordan had already gained acclaim for various TV roles but since I don't watch a lot of TV shows, this was my first exposure to him and I was very impressed. We surely have not seen the last of him. And Octavia Spencer is her usual solid self in the role of Oscar's mother.I had been looking forward to this movie, and when it opened today here in Cincinnati, I went to see it right away. The screening was well attended for a matinee showing (and heavily tilted towards African-Americans, I might add). I hope this movie becomes a runaway hit as it deserves and NEEDS to be seen.

1663697,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B00E1LQEFE,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[5, 11]","This is a small character study based on the life of Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old man who was shot at a public transit system in 2009 and became a symbol of injustice, especially of police brutality. If you aren't sure exactly what this incident was about, that's fine. Don't let that stop you from seeing this amazing piece of cinema.The actual incident was captured on cell phones - some of this footage opens the film.The movie takes place on New Year's Eve 2008. Oscar is recently out of jail and is trying to make his life work. He has a girlfriend and a daughter, so he is trying extremely hard to stay legitimate and give up his drug-dealing past. But financial and emotional stresses make it difficult for him to stay away from the high-risk, easy money life he had before. As he and his girlfriend make plans to celebrate New Year's Eve in the city, a random decision changes their lives forever.Part of the power of this film is in how real the characters are. There is almost no violence, no screaming, no scandal. If you are looking fora gritty movie about tough street thugs full of sex, betrayal, and bullet holes, then look elsewhere. This isn't that movie.The director carefully tries to humanize the incident. He doesn't sensationalize any particular aspect. Yes, Oscar and his friends are black, and racial profiling certainly may have played a part in what happened. But the movie doesn't exploit America's racial tension. Yes, there are characters that deal drugs, but they aren't depicted as violent, greedy thugs. Yes, there are characters that are single mothers, but they aren't bitter welfare queens whose lives are crumbling around them. And yes, most of the people are poor, but they aren't shiftless, lazy bums - they hold jobs and work extra shifts.The acting in this film is amazing. I completely bought the relationships among the characters, and their daily struggles. They weren't acting their roles, they were inhabiting them. This is especially true of the main actor, Michael B. Jordan. He has had minor roles in a few movies, but is probably more recognized from television than cinema. So he kind of comes out of nowhere for this movie. He is absolutely mesmerizing. To watch him switch from sensitive father to hardened thug and back again is like watching magic. His performance is far and away the best acting I've seen all year. If he doesn't win some kind of award for this role, then there is no justice in the world.When people become victims of crimes that morph into social issues, the human becomes a victim who then becomes a martyr. Everything gets lost in the hype. This movie pulls everything back down - the martyr is made into a victim who becomes human again. And you find yourself back in real life. Where trivial decisions mix with past mistakes, and suddenly you are at a confluence of forces that you are powerless to stop.This makes the incident more surprisingly powerful and emotional than any amount of news footage.",5,an amazingly realized personal tapestry,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,2977,"['small', 'character', 'study', 'based', 'life', 'Oscar', 'Grant', '22-year-old', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'shot', 'public', 'transit', 'system', '2009', 'became', 'symbol', 'injustice', 'especially', 'police', 'brutality', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'incident', 'was', 'about', 'fine', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'seeing', 'amazing', 'piece', 'cinema.The', 'actual', 'incident', 'was', 'captured', 'cell', 'phones', 'footage', 'film.The', 'movie', 'place', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', '2008', 'Oscar', 'recently', 'jail', 'trying', 'make', 'life', 'work', 'girlfriend', 'daughter', 'trying', 'extremely', 'hard', 'stay', 'legitimate', 'give', 'up', 'drug-dealing', 'past', 'financial', 'emotional', 'stresses', 'make', 'difficult', 'stay', 'away', 'high-risk', 'easy', 'money', 'life', 'had', 'before', 'girlfriend', 'make', 'plans', 'celebrate', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'city', 'random', 'decision', 'changes', 'lives', 'forever.Part', 'power', 'film', 'how', 'real', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'violence', 'screaming', 'scandal', 'are', 'looking', 'fora', 'gritty', 'movie', 'tough', 'street', 'thugs', 'full', 'sex', 'betrayal', 'bullet', 'holes', 'then', 'look', 'elsewhere', ""n't"", 'movie.The', 'director', 'carefully', 'humanize', 'incident', ""n't"", 'sensationalize', 'particular', 'aspect', 'Yes', 'Oscar', 'friends', 'are', 'black', 'racial', 'profiling', 'certainly', 'may', 'have', 'played', 'part', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', ""n't"", 'exploit', 'America', 'racial', 'tension', 'Yes', 'are', 'characters', 'deal', 'drugs', 'are', ""n't"", 'depicted', 'violent', 'greedy', 'thugs', 'Yes', 'are', 'characters', 'are', 'single', 'mothers', 'are', ""n't"", 'bitter', 'welfare', 'queens', 'lives', 'are', 'crumbling', 'yes', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'poor', 'are', ""n't"", 'shiftless', 'lazy', 'bums', 'hold', 'jobs', 'work', 'extra', 'shifts.The', 'acting', 'film', 'amazing', 'completely', 'bought', 'relationships', 'characters', 'daily', 'struggles', 'were', ""n't"", 'acting', 'roles', 'were', 'inhabiting', 'especially', 'true', 'main', 'actor', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'had', 'minor', 'roles', 'few', 'movies', 'probably', 'more', 'recognized', 'television', 'cinema', 'So', 'kind', 'nowhere', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'watch', 'switch', 'sensitive', 'father', 'hardened', 'thug', 'back', 'again', 'watching', 'magic', 'performance', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', ""n't"", 'win', 'kind', 'award', 'role', 'then', 'justice', 'world.When', 'people', 'become', 'victims', 'crimes', 'morph', 'social', 'issues', 'human', 'victim', 'who', 'then', 'martyr', 'Everything', 'lost', 'hype', 'movie', 'everything', 'back', 'down', 'martyr', 'made', 'victim', 'who', 'human', 'again', 'find', 'back', 'real', 'life', 'Where', 'trivial', 'decisions', 'mix', 'past', 'mistakes', 'suddenly', 'are', 'confluence', 'forces', 'are', 'powerless', 'stop.This', 'incident', 'more', 'surprisingly', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'amount', 'news', 'footage']",N/A

Oscar was unarmed and lying flat on the ground when the officer shot him before a crowd of horrified onlookers, an event caught on cell phone and video cameras by a number of the witnesses. Almost immediately, the videos went viral, prompting national outrage, mass protests in the Bay Area and a trial for murder (the officer was convicted of manslaughter and served less than a year of his two-year sentence). &#34;Fruitvale Station&#34; chronicles Oscar's final 24 hours of life as he and his friends and family prepare to celebrate the coming new year.How &#34;Fruitvale Station&#34; failed to garner an Oscar nomination for Best Picture - let alone Michael B. Jordan for Best Actor - is a complete mystery to me. The movie marks an extraordinary debut for writer/director Ryan Coogler and features a career-making, off-the- charts performance by Jordan, who has impressed us in a variety of TV roles (&#34;The Wire,&#34; &#34;Friday Night Lights,&#34; &#34;Parenthood&#34;), but who here really comes into his own as a leading man.As scenarist, Coogler avoids the obvious temptation of casting his subject in a heroic light. Oscar has clearly had his share of run-ins with the law, but he is just as clearly in the process of trying to get his act together, be it as a loving son and boyfriend (despite the occasional carousing) and doting father to a little girl. What Coogler recognizes - and so many even more seasoned movie makers don't - is that actual human beings are rarely either villains or saints, but are instead a complex mixture of weaknesses and strengths. The tragedy of Oscar's case is that, for all his faults, he seemed to be growing into full manhood when he met a senseless fate, partly the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time but wholly the result of another man acting badly. Because we already know where the narrative is headed, we are alert to the many ironies that are being brought into play as the story heads to its pre-ordained conclusion. This feeling of omniscience also heightens the poignancy of the story as we watch an ordinary man going through the motions of an ordinary day not knowing that it is to be his last.Coogler's direction is so naturalistic in tone and style that we could swear we are watching real life unfolding before our very eyes. This is particularly the case in the final stretches of the film in which he recreates the fateful event with a you-are-there immediacy that is positively breathtaking. The measure of a true artist, Coogler never pushes his points, allowing even the highly volatile racial and police brutality aspects of the incident to speak for themselves.It would be impossible to overrate Jordan's beautifully modulated and understated performance, but that should not keep us from acknowledging the stellar work of Octavia Spencer as his mother, Melonie Diaz as his girlfriend, Ariana Neal as his daughter and Chad Michael Murray (&#34;One Tree Hill&#34;) as Officer Ingram.Given the newsworthy circumstances of his death, Oscar Grant could easily have become either just another statistic or a larger-than-life figurehead in a movement for social justice. &#34;Fruitvale Station&#34; rescues him from that fate by showing us that the man we lost really was a man, with all the contradictory and glorious messiness that that entails. His story also drives home in a vivid way the very fragility of life itself, the sense that we are all just living on borrowed time, and that, because we never know when the end will come for us, we need to make the most of the time we are given here. Oscar Grant was trying to do just that when he met his senseless end at the barrel of a gun. &#34;Fruitvale Station&#34; is a moving tribute to his legacy.",5,No Oscars for Oscar?,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,3969,"['2009', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'old', 'when', '22-year-old', 'African', 'American', 'name', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'was', 'fatally', 'gunned', 'down', 'white', 'police', 'officer', 'BART', 'station', 'Oakland', 'California', 'died', 'hospital', 'next', 'morning', 'Oscar', 'was', 'unarmed', 'lying', 'flat', 'ground', 'when', 'officer', 'shot', 'crowd', 'horrified', 'onlookers', 'event', 'caught', 'cell', 'phone', 'video', 'cameras', 'number', 'witnesses', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'videos', 'went', 'viral', 'prompting', 'national', 'outrage', 'mass', 'protests', 'Bay', 'Area', 'trial', 'murder', 'officer', 'was', 'convicted', 'manslaughter', 'served', 'less', 'year', 'two-year', 'sentence', '34', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', '34', 'chronicles', 'Oscar', 'final', '24', 'hours', 'life', 'friends', 'family', 'prepare', 'celebrate', 'coming', 'new', 'year.How', '34', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', '34', 'failed', 'garner', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Picture', 'let', 'alone', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'Best', 'Actor', 'complete', 'mystery', 'movie', 'extraordinary', 'debut', 'writer/director', 'Ryan', 'Coogler', 'career-making', 'off-the-', 'charts', 'performance', 'Jordan', 'who', 'impressed', 'variety', 'TV', 'roles', '34', 'Wire', '34', '34', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', '34', '34', 'Parenthood', '34', 'who', 'here', 'really', 'own', 'leading', 'man.As', 'scenarist', 'Coogler', 'obvious', 'temptation', 'casting', 'subject', 'heroic', 'light', 'Oscar', 'clearly', 'had', 'share', 'run-ins', 'law', 'just', 'clearly', 'process', 'trying', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'be', 'loving', 'son', 'boyfriend', 'occasional', 'carousing', 'doting', 'father', 'little', 'girl', 'What', 'Coogler', 'so', 'many', 'even', 'more', 'seasoned', 'movie', 'makers', 'do', ""n't"", 'actual', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'rarely', 'villains', 'saints', 'are', 'instead', 'complex', 'mixture', 'weaknesses', 'strengths', 'tragedy', 'Oscar', 'case', 'faults', 'seemed', 'be', 'growing', 'full', 'manhood', 'when', 'met', 'senseless', 'fate', 'partly', 'result', 'being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'wholly', 'result', 'man', 'acting', 'badly', 'already', 'know', 'where', 'narrative', 'headed', 'are', 'alert', 'many', 'ironies', 'are', 'being', 'brought', 'play', 'story', 'heads', 'pre-ordained', 'conclusion', 'feeling', 'omniscience', 'also', 'poignancy', 'story', 'watch', 'ordinary', 'man', 'going', 'motions', 'ordinary', 'day', 'not', 'knowing', 'be', 'last.Coogler', 'direction', 'so', 'naturalistic', 'tone', 'style', 'could', 'swear', 'are', 'watching', 'real', 'life', 'unfolding', 'very', 'eyes', 'particularly', 'case', 'final', 'stretches', 'film', 'fateful', 'event', 'you-are-there', 'immediacy', 'positively', 'breathtaking', 'measure', 'true', 'artist', 'Coogler', 'never', 'points', 'allowing', 'even', 'highly', 'volatile', 'racial', 'police', 'brutality', 'aspects', 'incident', 'speak', 'themselves.It', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'overrate', 'Jordan', 'beautifully', 'modulated', 'understated', 'performance', 'should', 'not', 'keep', 'acknowledging', 'stellar', 'work', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'mother', 'Melonie', 'Diaz', 'girlfriend', 'Ariana', 'Neal', 'daughter', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', '34', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', '34', 'Officer', 'Ingram.Given', 'newsworthy', 'circumstances', 'death', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'become', 'just', 'statistic', 'larger-than-life', 'figurehead', 'movement', 'social', 'justice', '34', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', '34', 'rescues', 'fate', 'showing', 'man', 'lost', 'really', 'was', 'man', 'contradictory', 'glorious', 'messiness', 'story', 'also', 'home', 'vivid', 'way', 'very', 'fragility', 'life', 'sense', 'are', 'just', 'living', 'borrowed', 'time', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'end', 'will', 'come', 'need', 'make', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'given', 'here', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'just', 'when', 'met', 'senseless', 'end', 'barrel', 'gun', '34', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', '34', 'moving', 'tribute', 'legacy']",N/A
1663706,AS6K15HL31TDW,B00E1LQEFE,R. Sumners,"[0, 1]","This Martin Luther King weekend, I finally had the opportunity to watch the film ""Fruitvale Station"".  I would like to believe, in my heart of hearts, that we as a nation have made great strides with regard to civil rights and racial equality since Dr. King had a dream, but this film served as a solemn reminder that we as a people have a long way yet to go, light years, really, in our trajectory towards fulfilling that dream.  The changing of laws is relatively simple compared to the changing of hearts and minds.  Oscar Grant was not a hero or a saint; he was just a human being like all of us, flawed and virtuous, a man trying to put his life back together who happened to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time...and who happened to be the ""wrong"" color.  The film was objective and straightforward in its depiction of the last day of Mr. Grant's life, and the extensive use of handheld cameras added to the sense of being there, being in the moment as events transpired.  Ryan Coogler is a gifted director--this was an astonishing film in its own right, let alone as a first effort--it reminded me of the style of Paul Greengrass, whose ""United 93"" and ""Bloody Sunday"" gave the viewer an intimate sense of chaotic reality.  The film is powerful and heartbreaking, and its depiction of Mr. Grant's senseless murder by the police is nonetheless shocking, even when we already know what is going to happen.  The officer who fired the bullet through Mr. Grant's chest that ended his life as he lay face-down on the cold, tiled floor, handcuffed, as another officer held him down with a knee on his head, insisted that he thought he had pulled his taser and not his service revolver, and confused the two in the ""heat of the moment""--yet a cellphone photo taken only moments before by Mr. Grant himself reveals that same officer with his hand on his taser, indicating that he knew full well where his taser was on his gun belt and was familiar with it.On the day that we celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King, I believe it is profoundly important that we derive from the stories of people like Oscar Grant, and Trayvon Martin, and Amadou Diallo, and many others in this country who have paid a horrible price--including Dr. King himself--that the malignant force that is racism is by no means extinct in this country, and that we as a nation still have a long way to go in the struggle to truly fulfill his dream of equality.  We all need to climb to the mountaintop.  We need to realize as human beings that what threatens the equality of people anywhere, threatens us everywhere.",5,A powerful film about a senseless tragedy.,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,2601,"['Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'weekend', 'finally', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'film', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'heart', 'hearts', 'nation', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'strides', 'regard', 'civil', 'rights', 'racial', 'equality', 'Dr.', 'King', 'had', 'dream', 'film', 'served', 'solemn', 'reminder', 'people', 'have', 'long', 'way', 'yet', 'go', 'light', 'years', 'really', 'trajectory', 'towards', 'fulfilling', 'dream', 'changing', 'laws', 'relatively', 'simple', 'compared', 'changing', 'hearts', 'minds', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'was', 'not', 'hero', 'saint', 'was', 'just', 'human', 'being', 'flawed', 'virtuous', 'man', 'trying', 'put', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'wrong', 'color', 'film', 'was', 'objective', 'straightforward', 'depiction', 'last', 'day', 'Mr.', 'Grant', 'life', 'extensive', 'use', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'added', 'sense', 'being', 'there', 'being', 'moment', 'events', 'transpired', 'Ryan', 'Coogler', 'gifted', 'director', 'was', 'astonishing', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'let', 'alone', 'first', 'effort', 'reminded', 'style', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'United', '93', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'gave', 'viewer', 'intimate', 'sense', 'chaotic', 'reality', 'film', 'powerful', 'heartbreaking', 'depiction', 'Mr.', 'Grant', 'senseless', 'murder', 'police', 'nonetheless', 'shocking', 'even', 'when', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'officer', 'who', 'fired', 'bullet', 'Mr.', 'Grant', 'chest', 'ended', 'life', 'lay', 'face-down', 'cold', 'tiled', 'floor', 'handcuffed', 'officer', 'held', 'down', 'knee', 'head', 'insisted', 'thought', 'had', 'pulled', 'taser', 'not', 'service', 'revolver', 'confused', 'two', 'heat', 'moment', 'yet', 'cellphone', 'photo', 'taken', 'only', 'moments', 'Mr.', 'Grant', 'same', 'officer', 'hand', 'taser', 'indicating', 'knew', 'full', 'well', 'where', 'taser', 'was', 'gun', 'belt', 'was', 'familiar', 'it.On', 'day', 'celebrate', 'life', 'accomplishments', 'Dr.', 'King', 'believe', 'profoundly', 'important', 'derive', 'stories', 'people', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'Trayvon', 'Martin', 'Amadou', 'Diallo', 'many', 'others', 'country', 'who', 'have', 'paid', 'horrible', 'price', 'including', 'Dr.', 'King', 'malignant', 'force', 'racism', 'means', 'extinct', 'country', 'nation', 'still', 'have', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'struggle', 'truly', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'equality', 'need', 'climb', 'mountaintop', 'need', 'realize', 'human', 'beings', 'what', 'equality', 'people', 'anywhere', 'everywhere']",N/A

The most basic plot summary gives away the ending.  I guess I expected it to be more political.  It is rather a slice of life.  Kudos to Ryan Coogler for his depiction of Oscar Grant not as a martyr but rather as a young guy with anger issues struggling to make a living and a better future for his girlfriend and particularly his daughter.  Although Coogler had the cooperation of the family's attorney and so had access to some personal detail, I imagine he had to create dialogue, scenes, perhaps characters to create a cohesive narrative.The movie is only 85 minutes long.  It ends with film from an actual memorial service that took place on the anniversary of the shooting.  Since the film incorporates real people, I wish we had been told more about how Sophina (the girl friend) and Tatiana (the daughter) are doing today.The performances are solid, anchored by Michael B. Jordan as Oscar.  His scenes with his daughter are so touching, and then he erupts into these fits of rage (usually reacting to someone who is really, really in his face).  All of the characters ring true, with special mention of the awesome Octavia Spencer as Oscar's mom.  She is the nucleus of the family and in many ways the nucleus of this movie.The camera work on the BART scene is so frenetic.  People searching for a clue that the officer was justified in shooting Oscar will be disappointed.  Ryan Coogler creates an environment where people are not all good or all bad and where life can be ended in an instant.  It feels very real and also very sad.  It's not an easy movie to watch and it will stay with you for a good while after it's over.",4,"A small, worthwhile movie",1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,1774,"['knew', 'was', 'last', 'day', 'earth', 'would', 'live', 'differently', 'question', 'kept', 'going', 'mind', 'watched', 'movie', 'most', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'away', 'ending', 'guess', 'expected', 'be', 'more', 'political', 'rather', 'slice', 'life', 'Kudos', 'Ryan', 'Coogler', 'depiction', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'not', 'martyr', 'rather', 'young', 'guy', 'anger', 'issues', 'struggling', 'make', 'living', 'better', 'future', 'girlfriend', 'particularly', 'daughter', 'Coogler', 'had', 'cooperation', 'family', 'attorney', 'so', 'had', 'access', 'personal', 'detail', 'imagine', 'had', 'create', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'perhaps', 'characters', 'create', 'cohesive', 'narrative.The', 'movie', 'only', '85', 'minutes', 'long', 'film', 'actual', 'memorial', 'service', 'took', 'place', 'anniversary', 'shooting', 'film', 'real', 'people', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'more', 'how', 'Sophina', 'girl', 'friend', 'Tatiana', 'daughter', 'are', 'doing', 'today.The', 'performances', 'are', 'solid', 'anchored', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'Oscar', 'scenes', 'daughter', 'are', 'so', 'touching', 'then', 'fits', 'rage', 'usually', 'reacting', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'really', 'face', 'characters', 'ring', 'true', 'special', 'mention', 'awesome', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'Oscar', 'mom', 'nucleus', 'family', 'many', 'ways', 'nucleus', 'movie.The', 'camera', 'work', 'BART', 'scene', 'so', 'frenetic', 'People', 'searching', 'clue', 'officer', 'was', 'justified', 'shooting', 'Oscar', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Ryan', 'Coogler', 'environment', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'good', 'bad', 'where', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'ended', 'instant', 'very', 'real', 'also', 'very', 'sad', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'will', 'stay', 'good', 'while', 'over']",N/A

Even if you are not, the film will spoil the ending with the opening scene that features cell phone footage of the event that ends with a solitary gun fire.  The move then gets fictionalized with Oscar Grant waking up the same day.  He is a father raising his daughter with her mother.  This is not a fluff piece on Grant to make us to easily hate how the story ends for him.  This is the story of his last day warts and all.  He is awoken to an accusation of infidelity (which he cops to), he has severed time for dealing drugs and he still had one foot in that world.The complexity only makes the movie better.  But it is the acting that makes the movie worth watching.  Anyone who has seen Friday Night Lights knows just how good an actor Michael B. Jordan is, and that talent is on full display as a lead actor going head to head with Oscar winner Octavia Spencer as his mother.  Jordan shows a wide range as a guy trying to get by and not sure if he should do it by any means necessary or in a way that will make his daughter and mother proud.The DVD also has two Special Features.

Grant is realistically and reasonably depicted in a fantastic performance by Michael B. Jordan as a 22 year old young man in the process of figuring out how best to handle his responsibilities and becomes an adult.  However you view his decisions, watching him live out his final day on Earth forces you to realize how a few different reactions by him or especially those that would judge him could have prevented his tragic death.While it would be interesting to learn more about Johannes Mehserle, the BART officer who killed Grant, that is the subject for another work.  Jordan and writer/director Ryan Coogler are out to tell Oscar's story, and they succeed admirably.Fruitvale Station does not seem like the first feature film of a 26 year old (now 27, the same age that Grant would be were he still alive) film school grad, and it certainly makes Coogler an artist to watch over the coming years.I was a little disappointed in the DVD release, as the movie leaves the viewer with a lot of questions about the historical event, but the extras almost entirely focus on the creation of the movie.

San Francisco/Bay area's Bay Area Rapid Transit system, or BART, has a station in this neighborhood; hence, Fruitvale Station, where the film's pivotal scene takes place. The film tells the true story of Oscar Grant III (Michael B. Jordan), a 22-year-old man with a troubled past, who is trying to turn his life around to be a better partner to his girlfriend, Sophina, Dad to their little girl, Tatiana, and son to the mother he loves so much. In a flashback to his last prison stint, his mother (The Help's Octavia Spencer) has told him that she will no longer be there for him if he can't get his life straightened out and be there for his daughter. While he loves his family deeply and wants to change, he is caught between the &#34;straight&#34; life that seems just out of reach and his former criminal one. Oscar pretends that everything is going great, but that couldn't be further from the truth.While I found this film touching and the end deeply affecting, I can't in all honesty say it's the best movie ever or even the best movie I've seen so far this year. I took issue with a few of the things depicted. That said, it does have an important story to tell and, on that level, I would definitely recommend it.Note that this movie is rated R. There are a few sexual situations, though I did not find them at all graphic, LOTS of profanity (especially when Oscar and his buddies are hanging out) and a violent ending (this is not a spoiler as the film's description on the product page gives away the ending).This film has quite the pedigree: It won the Grand Jury prize AND the Audience Award at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, and Movie of the Year at the 2014 AFI Awards.

1663714,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B00E1LQEFE,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 0]","I liked that the character was presented with weaknesses and strengths which made him very believable. It was fascinating watching a young person grow up: you can see the outline of the man he would've become as he learns from his mistakes, the way he lovingly engages in parenting his little girl, and his relationships with his lady and his family. Outstanding acting by Michael Jordon, and the cast. Outstanding writing; the writer hit it out the park by largely presenting the story as if it wasn't Oscar's last day, so we get to experience his life with him. Also the writer gave us enough information about Oscar to make him interesting, as well as surrounding him with believable characters (as when the Caucasian young woman he initiates a conversation with in the market initially leans away from his attempt to engage her. Just that accurate behavior shows how African Americans have to work just that extra bit harder to be seen as normal citizens). I predict this writer/director, if he keeps being spot on with human behavior as he demonstrates here, will be winning Oscars. In my opinion, the sign of a really good writer is how she/he writes supporting characters; to me the characters surrounding the lead are as important as the lead, in terms of providing valuable information for the audience. Because this is a believable character study, the film ends up being a celebration of too brief a life.  Well done. 4 and a half stars. A half star removed for use of the N word. Hopefully, one day soon, directors making films featuring African American characters won't feel the need to insert racial slurs into their dialogue. Film would've worked just as well and been just as believable without the slurs. And if they need to find encouragement: there are many jewish film makers but most don't have jewish characters referred to with racial slurs in their films. Just not that hard to do guys. You think what, audiences are going to walk out of films thinking to themselves ""if only one of the black characters had referred to another of the african american characters as N, then the film would've seemed so much more authentic.""

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 1]","First a note: Amazon has a policy of combining all reviews of ALL formats of a film (in theaters, Amazon Instant, David and Bluray).  So, as I post this, there are already 147 reviews posted, even though David and BD were not released until this week. My suggestion is always to sort reviews by &#8220;Newist First and also look at the format that the reviewer is discussing. Because the Amazon Instant versions do not include any bonus features, I will spend most of my time on those. This is a review of the David version.&#8220;Fruitvale Station&#8221;, an &#8220;audience&#8221; winner at both the Sundance Festival and at Cannes, is the kind of &#8220;independent&#8221; film that the Weinstein Company specializes in: Films that would not get the notoriety they deserve without promotion. Nearly every release that I&#8217;ve seen from Bob and Harvey Weinstein&#8217;s company has been &#8220;special&#8221;, and this one is no different.The 85-minute film is based on the true story of Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old San Francisco Bay area black man ( living with his &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; and their four year-old daughter), who was gunned down by a transit police officer on New Year&#8217;s Eve in 2009 at the &#8220;Fruitvale&#8221; subway transit station. It was definitely a case of racial profiling. What makes the film difficult (emotionally) to watch is that the film starts with the murder and then, immediately, flashes back 24 hours to show us what Grant was going through in his daily life. You know the end is coming (this is not a &#8220;spoiler alert&#8221; because you know up front what will happen) and seeing Grant deal with a job loss and &#8211; more importantly &#8211; watching the bond he has with his mother (the Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer &#8211; &#8220;The Help&#8221;) and his daughter (an amazing performance by the young Ariana Neal!) and knowing it will soon end. There are two scenes featuring Neal that will pull a tear from your eye. The first is the kiss she gives Grant as he leaves her at pre-school one day. The other is the final shot in the film, with Neal in the shower.Actress Spencer is listed as a Producer in the credits, but the big name that got this film made was Forest Whitaker. And, of course, the Weinsteins who got it distributed.The David includes two bonus features that, when taken together, run nearly as long as the film. First there is &#8220; Fruitvale Station: The Story of Oscar Grant&#8221;, a 21-minute featurette that features the cast and the production team (including Whitaker) and discusses, not only the film but interviews journalist on the subject of racial profiling.  Though a few scenes from the film are included, they are included sparingly. I found this bonus very helpful in understanding more about Grant and the film. The other bonus is a 27-minute &#8220;Q&A; with Cast and Filmmakers&#8221; recorded in Oakland in July 2013. It was interesting to watch but I felt that much of it repeated comments already covered in the other &#8220;bonus&#8221;.I appreciated knowing the story of Grant &#8211; which made more headlines in the West Coast than a &#8220;similar&#8221; event with Trayvon Martin in Florida &#8211; and I&#8217;m glad I saw it.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",4,"Review of David plus Bonus Features - ""A life taken way too soon""",1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,3345,"['First', 'note', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'combining', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'formats', 'film', 'theaters', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'David', 'Bluray', 'So', 'post', 'are', 'already', '147', 'reviews', 'posted', 'even', 'David', 'BD', 'were', 'not', 'released', 'week', 'suggestion', 'always', 'sort', 'reviews', '8220', 'Newist', 'First', 'also', 'look', 'format', 'reviewer', 'discussing', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'versions', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'bonus', 'features', 'will', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'review', 'David', 'version.', '8220', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', '8221', '8220', 'audience', '8221', 'winner', 'Sundance', 'Festival', 'Cannes', 'kind', '8220', 'independent', '8221', 'film', 'Weinstein', 'Company', 'Films', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'notoriety', 'deserve', 'promotion', 'Nearly', 'release', '8217', 'seen', 'Bob', 'Harvey', 'Weinstein', '8217', 's', 'company', 'been', '8220', 'special', '8221', 'one', 'different.The', '85-minute', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Oscar', 'Grant', '22-year-old', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'area', 'black', 'man', 'living', '8220', 'girlfriend', '8221', 'four', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'gunned', 'down', 'transit', 'police', 'officer', 'New', 'Year', '8217', 's', 'Eve', '2009', '8220', 'Fruitvale', '8221', 'transit', 'station', 'was', 'definitely', 'case', 'racial', 'profiling', 'What', 'film', 'difficult', 'emotionally', 'watch', 'film', 'murder', 'then', 'immediately', 'flashes', 'back', '24', 'hours', 'show', 'what', 'Grant', 'was', 'going', 'daily', 'life', 'know', 'end', 'coming', 'not', '8220', 'spoiler', 'alert', '8221', 'know', 'up', 'front', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'seeing', 'Grant', 'deal', 'job', 'loss', '8211', 'more', 'importantly', '8211', 'watching', 'bond', 'mother', 'Oscar-winning', 'actress', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', '8211', '8220', 'Help', '8221', 'daughter', 'amazing', 'performance', 'young', 'Ariana', 'Neal', 'knowing', 'will', 'soon', 'end', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'Neal', 'will', 'pull', 'tear', 'eye', 'first', 'kiss', 'Grant', 'pre-school', 'one', 'day', 'other', 'final', 'shot', 'film', 'Neal', 'shower.Actress', 'Spencer', 'listed', 'Producer', 'credits', 'big', 'name', 'got', 'film', 'made', 'was', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'course', 'Weinsteins', 'who', 'got', 'David', 'two', 'bonus', 'features', 'when', 'taken', 'together', 'run', 'nearly', 'as', 'long', 'film', 'First', '8220', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'Story', 'Oscar', 'Grant', '8221', '21-minute', 'featurette', 'cast', 'production', 'team', 'including', 'Whitaker', 'discusses', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'interviews', 'journalist', 'subject', 'racial', 'profiling', 'few', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'included', 'sparingly', 'found', 'bonus', 'very', 'helpful', 'understanding', 'more', 'Grant', 'film', 'other', 'bonus', '27-minute', '8220', 'Q', 'A', 'Cast', 'Filmmakers', '8221', 'recorded', 'Oakland', 'July', '2013', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch', 'felt', 'much', 'repeated', 'comments', 'already', 'covered', 'other', '8220', '8221', 'appreciated', 'knowing', 'story', 'Grant', '8211', 'made', 'more', 'headlines', 'West', 'Coast', '8220', 'similar', '8221', 'event', 'Trayvon', 'Martin', 'Florida', '8211', '8217', 'glad', 'saw', 'it.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",N/A

1663726,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00E1LQEFE,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[7, 12]","There is a narrative technique used a lot lately, primarily in television. The episode opens with a big showdown, guns drawn, or in the middle of a big, dramatic moment, the characters arguing with one another, and just as the moment reaches its climax, a title card pops up and we move backward in time: ""72 hours earlier"", ""5 Days Ago..."" The writers and director want to grab our attention and the true beginning of the story is static or less interesting, so they give us a preview of the climax to grab our attention.I find it to be kind of a cop-out; the writers and director are creating the story, this universe. If it doesn't have a natural hook, fix it.In ""Fruitvale Station"", first-time director Ryan Coogler's new film starring Michael P. Jordan as Oscar Grant III, the film begins in a similar fashion. Coogler shows us actual cell phone footage of the incident that happened on New Year's Eve at the BART Station. We watch the grainy footage, horrified to see the event happening to and because of real people. But I think Coogler's motives for showing us this footage are different; sure, he wants to grab our attention, but he also wants to give us proof that this event actually happened. Because it seems so incredulous that a young man could be killed. In such a way. As recently as four years ago.There may be some people out there who still can't believe this type of thing can happen - some people still believe the Holocaust never happened. But this movie was also released the weekend before the George Zimmerman verdict was issued. When something like this happens, the events depicted in the film seem even more real, senseless and heartbreaking. And the hope that something like this could never happen shrinks even more.After we watch the video footage, we join Oscar (Jordan) on the morning of New Year's Eve, 2008. He wakes up next to his girlfriend, Sophina (Melonie Diaz), feeling frisky. But before anything happens, their daughter, Thatiana (Ariana Neal) comes in and wants to sleep with them. When they wake up, we watch them get ready for the day, make preparations for Oscar's mom's (Octavia Spencer) birthday party that evening, make plans to go out and celebrate the New Year holiday later that evening. Soon, Sophina is at work and Oscar drives around trying to make some order, some sense of his life. He stops at Farmer Joe's and tries to talk his boss into giving him his job back. Oscar wants and needs to change his ways, to become the responsible adult his family needs. But old rivalries surface during his New Year's Eve celebration.This is Ryan Coogler's first film and this is evident in both good and bad ways. Because he is new to this, there seems to be less emphasis on hitting plot points at studio-recognized intervals, allowing the story to flow in a more natural way. This gives us the opportunity to go along for the ride, literally, with Oscar as he meanders around, trying to create a new persona for himself. There are dramatic plot points throughout his story, but they seem less Hollywood, less forced than most and help give us a sense of this young man's life.Because this is Coogler's first film, he doesn't have the experience to self-edit and falls victim to a few overly dramatic moments that serve to draw us out of the narrative. The most obnoxious is a moment when Oscar stops to get gas. As he is standing at the pump, a stray dog is hit by another car. Oscar runs to the dog's side and comforts him as he dies. Unfortunately, this scene really hammers home, in a none-too subtle fashion, what the rest of the film does so well. Most of the film paints a believable, subtle portrait of Oscar as a well-meaning young man, not without his problems, who is trying to put his life together, when he falls victim to a stupid, senseless shooting. Oscar's humanity is illustrated by his attempts to comfort the dog in his dying moments. And the dog's senseless death foreshadows Oscar's final moments at the Fruitvale BART Station. This moment isn't needed and its obvious message makes it stand out like a sore thumb.Michael P. Jordan is an actor who will become a major star. He has appeared in a number of film and television projects, earning impressive critiques for his work. Until now, most of the great reviews have been for his work in television - ""Friday Night Lights"", ""Parenthood"" - but that is changing with this new film. This is the type of performance that can earn a relatively unknown actor an Oscar nomination and set him on a course to make some big-budget studio mistakes (Both Coogler and Jordan are close to signing on for ""Creed"", a ""Rocky"" re-boot being marshaled by Stallone when he isn't working on ""The Expendables III"") before they get their career on track and start earning critical notices again.Riding around with Oscar all day gives us the opportunity to really become a part of his life, to see his decision-making process and to see how these decisions affect his life. As Oscar drives around, Jordan makes the character believable by just letting him be. Oscar stops by Farmer Joe's to accomplish a few things; he needs to get some crabs for his mom's birthday dinner and he needs his job back. He visits with a former co-worker, flirts with a female customer and then pleads with his former boss, trying to convince him he has changed, he will do better. Much of Oscar's life involves this sort of give and take, good and bad, nothing is a straight-forward moment.Octavia Spencer plays Wanda, Oscar's mom. She has a few short scenes but the impact of her influence on her son's life is clear; he calls her while driving and she immediately admonishes him for using a cell phone in his car. This is a small, but believable moment; we can each hear our mom admonishing us for doing the same thing.Melonie Diaz plays Sophina, Oscar's girlfriend and the mother of their child. Her performance is the equal of Jordan's in many ways. She is interacting with her boyfriend; someone she loves and cares for, but who also frustrates her. This young couple is, in many ways, both more and less mature than other people their age; they have been through some problems, helping them gain a certain maturity, but they are still young and prone to making mistakes. Watching these moments unfold in `real time' helps us to become a part of their lives.Everything is the film is designed to lead us to the inevitable moment at the end of the film. Remember, we have already watched real found footage of Oscar's last moments on the BART platform in East Oakland. Watching the cell phone recording first thing has amped us up, made us anticipate the final moments even more. Because Coogler has already shown us the most important part of the film, our anticipation heightens the drama of the moment, making it more memorable and more powerful.""Fruitvale Station"" is a very good, very raw, very powerful look at a distinct low point in our recent history. Unfortunately, we seem to continue to have these, letting history repeat itself again...And again...And again...And again.",4,"Those Who Cannot Remember the Past, Are Doomed to Repeat

This is a film dramatization of the last twenty-four hours of Oscar Grant (played by Michael B. Jordan), except some actual video footage inserted.So the comparatively short film (only 85 minutes) is more like an attempt to put a human face to the victim of the shooting than a record of the incident itself, and it largely works. The film is most effective when Octavia Spencer (&#8220;The Help&#8221;) as Oscar&#8217;s mother is on screen, bringing an emotional reality to the role.We don&#8217;t really know how much of the screenplay is based on the actual events. Did Oscar Grant befriend a stray dog at the gas station? Some scenes look forced, some drawn-out.

1663732,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00E1LQEFE,Turfseer,"[11, 26]","***This review may contain spoilers***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0At a recent screening of `Fruitvale Station', I asked director Ryan Coogler if he believed the Involuntary Manslaughter conviction of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) officer who shot Oscar Grant, was justified.  Coogler was circumspect, stating that he was just trying to make a movie about what happened but he added that he could understand how Grant's family could have been very much upset with the verdict.  An African-American man in the audience commented that that the film did a great service in pointing out the ongoing problem of police brutality in America today; again Coogler was circumspect, acknowledging that his film has engendered a multiplicity of opinions as to the proper verdict for the officer who was charged with Grant's shooting.From my point of viewpoint, despite Coogler's refusal to take sides in public, it's clear that he's seeking to manipulate his audience so that they feel outraged at Grant's shooting.  He accomplishes this by creating a fictional narrative of one last `day-in-the-life' of Grant's movements, before the fatal shooting. Perhaps Coogler was reacting to some of the unfortunate public disparagements of Grant after he was killed; but Coogler goes overboard in making him into a martyr.  By stacking a whole group of improbable incidents that emphasize what a `good guy' Grant was, into one day, the entire narrative feels manipulative and forced.And what exactly are all these incidents that may or may not have actually occurred?  Perhaps the most bathetic of Coogler's manipulations is when he has Grant give the stray pit bull that had been killed by a hit and run driver, his last `rites' by the seashore (highly unlikely that this occurred as Grant is never seen telling anyone about it!).  There are more questionable incidents for example: Grant calling his mother for some `fish fry wisdom' for the untutored female shopper and patiently convincing a shop owner to allow the women he was with (along with another pregnant passerby) to use the bathroom.  If in fact this film ISN'T designed to provoke outrage over a perceived injustice, A.A. Dowd of the A.V. Club writes that its intended impact is significantly diminished: ""Fruitvale Station plays like an uncomplicated eulogy, with little more to say on its subject than ""what a shame this bad thing happened.""While Coogler attempts to humanize his protagonist by showing him to have a serious anger management problem, Grant's anger (in Coogler's eyes) sometimes seems to be justified.  Take for example, Grant's blow-up in the flashback when he's a prisoner at San Quentin--it's the correction officers who are preventing Grant from talking to his mother.I understand that what Coogler was trying to say about Grant was that at a certain point in his life he was not perfect and had some problems, but by the time he was killed, he had gotten his life together and moved past what was going on in the past.  That may be true but sometimes `karma' has a way of catching up with you.  Grant was actually put in prison for weapons possession (a fact that Coogler does not mention).  His confrontation on the train with the ex-con who tormented him in prison led to Grant being taken off the train by the police at Fruitvale Station.  Had he not been in prison in the first place, he most likely would never have had that confrontation on the train, and would never have been taken off the train, which led to his death.  So here was a guy who was going forward but could not escape his past. This tragic theme seems a lot more truthful than Coogler's agenda which was to highlight the injustice of the verdict.Unfortunately, if one is looking for a case of classic police brutality, what happened at Fruitvale Station, does not fit the bill as the `poster child' for such incidents. The officer charged with the crime indicated that he mistakenly reached for his gun instead of his Taser.  If he was going to shoot someone intentionally, would it be in front of  witnesses who were filming the incident with their cell  phone cameras?  Clearly it was an accident.  But why does Coogler fail to mention that one of Grant's friends heard the officer say, ""I'm going to tase him.""  Because by doing so, that would be proof that the shooting was an accident and unintentional. In reality, this was a case of negligence, not brutality on the part of the police, despite Mr. Coogler's apparent stance to the contrary.Despite all the mixed messages, Coogler still should be commended for his technical expertise.  Working with a team of fellow USC students, Coogler has managed to put together a nice-looking film.  He directs his actors well, particularly during the taut, climactic scene, where the tragic action unfolds.  The neophyte director has bit off more than he can chew, attempting to dissect a topic infused with racial animus.  Next time he would be much better served churning out a less controversial, commercial product.  Whatever the case, it's likely he has a good chance of going far in today's ever-challenging film industry.",2,Protest against unjust verdict or uncomplicated eulogy?

1663736,A4YXKE5F62II8,B00E1LQEFE,Visual Bureau,"[1, 3]","&#34;A favourite at the Sundance Film Festival at 2013 (along with Don Jon's Addiction), Fruitvale Station (or known as Fruitvale, in some corners and festival patrons) is a rather simple, realistically performed, shocking, and depressing debut feature film from a 27 year old director named Ryan Coogler who graduated from USC. That component alone of it being a feature debut from a well-known university alumnus and the realistic presence of the film's portrayal before-and-after the controversial BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) shooting in 2007 to ex-convict Oscar Grant.Coogler manages to create a film that speaks a lot to its audience without becoming too preachy and racially charged in the way that Spike Lee or John Singleton would do it but provide a sort-of guerilla, student-film feel to the film that given its encircled popularity at the box office (managed to make around more than $10 million and to be screened in 1,000-so cinemas in America and Canada), Forest Whitaker's producing credentials, and the strong reviews at 93% Rotten Tomatoes or higher, it shows that this was more intriguing than I could call for. Also, the film's discussion about police brutality and force (while not lingering onto the explicit racial overtones) in correspondence to the Trayvon Martin v. George Zimmerman trial that occurred in Florida at the time. While that is a very politicised and controversial move on part of the Weinstein brothers' and Coogler's campaign to heighten awareness of the film, it is still nonetheless relevant enough to understand that some people do not always a perception of reality and the politics or beliefs on something (in this case, the blacks were the perceived suspects of the crime on the train).While the film's politics is not delved that much, it is more of an emotional, single day exploration about a man trying to do good for his family and turn his life around after spending time behind bars (it is not clear what he was arrested for but drug dealing/use maybe possible). Michael B. Jordan as Oscar Grant is compelling and believable enough (potentially if worthy of Golden Globe attention but that is a competitive business, I will admit) and knowing that Coogler and the people helping on his film seeing the real Grant family only makes the film even more believable and startling.The best scenes are surprisingly the ones where you do not actually anticipate something and it shows Grant trying to think about his life, text messaging with a clever use of CG to make the SMS graphics, and going to the supermarket Farmer Joe's to get his job back. One of the most troubling scenes for me was not only the incident but the discussions between him and his mother and wife trying to cope with him being out of the cells and sticking by knowing he did that, leave his daughter troubled but still joyous, and his mother and wife having to stick by his side. That troubles me because people who end up on the incarcerated side of life are usually unfit to have children, raise a family, or deal with regular people in society and the penal system once you get out is even more troubling to deal with regular life as they will not hire you.Needless to say, it is tragic, it is tough but not too ballsy, it can be funny at times but it is far from comedy, and it is one of those films that Ang Lee, Martin Scorsese, or Charles Burnett (who directed Killer of Sheep when during his film school years, which these two films follow a similar aesthetic of being realistic and simply done) would be proud.&#34;",3,"While life after crime is inexcusable, it is nonetheless a well-performed, realistic, and gritty film from a first-time director",1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,3547,"['34', 'favourite', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', '2013', 'Don', 'Jon', 'Addiction', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', 'known', 'Fruitvale', 'corners', 'festival', 'patrons', 'rather', 'simple', 'realistically', 'performed', 'shocking', 'depressing', 'debut', 'feature', 'film', '27', 'year', 'old', 'director', 'named', 'Ryan', 'Coogler', 'who', 'graduated', 'USC', 'component', 'alone', 'being', 'feature', 'debut', 'well-known', 'university', 'alumnus', 'realistic', 'presence', 'film', 'portrayal', 'before-and-after', 'controversial', 'BART', 'Bay', 'Area', 'Rapid', 'Transit', 'shooting', '2007', 'ex-convict', 'Oscar', 'Grant.Coogler', 'create', 'film', 'lot', 'audience', 'becoming', 'too', 'preachy', 'racially', 'charged', 'way', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'John', 'Singleton', 'would', 'do', 'provide', 'sort-of', 'guerilla', 'student-film', 'feel', 'film', 'given', 'encircled', 'popularity', 'box', 'office', 'managed', 'make', 'around', 'more', '10', 'million', 'be', 'screened', '1,000-so', 'cinemas', 'America', 'Canada', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'producing', 'credentials', 'strong', 'reviews', '93', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'higher', 'was', 'more', 'intriguing', 'could', 'call', 'Also', 'film', 'discussion', 'police', 'brutality', 'force', 'not', 'lingering', 'explicit', 'racial', 'overtones', 'correspondence', 'Trayvon', 'Martin', 'v.', 'George', 'Zimmerman', 'trial', 'occurred', 'Florida', 'time', 'very', 'politicised', 'controversial', 'move', 'part', 'Weinstein', 'brothers', 'Coogler', 'campaign', 'heighten', 'awareness', 'film', 'still', 'nonetheless', 'relevant', 'enough', 'understand', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'perception', 'reality', 'politics', 'beliefs', 'something', 'case', 'blacks', 'were', 'perceived', 'suspects', 'crime', 'train', 'film', 'politics', 'not', 'delved', 'much', 'more', 'emotional', 'single', 'day', 'exploration', 'man', 'trying', 'do', 'good', 'family', 'turn', 'life', 'around', 'spending', 'time', 'bars', 'not', 'clear', 'what', 'was', 'arrested', 'drug', 'dealing/use', 'maybe', 'possible', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'Oscar', 'Grant', 'compelling', 'believable', 'enough', 'potentially', 'worthy', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'attention', 'competitive', 'business', 'will', 'admit', 'knowing', 'Coogler', 'people', 'helping', 'film', 'seeing', 'real', 'Grant', 'family', 'only', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'believable', 'startling.The', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'ones', 'where', 'do', 'not', 'actually', 'anticipate', 'something', 'Grant', 'trying', 'think', 'life', 'text', 'messaging', 'clever', 'use', 'CG', 'make', 'SMS', 'graphics', 'going', 'supermarket', 'Farmer', 'Joe', 'get', 'job', 'back', 'One', 'most', 'troubling', 'scenes', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'incident', 'discussions', 'mother', 'wife', 'trying', 'cope', 'being', 'cells', 'sticking', 'knowing', 'did', 'leave', 'daughter', 'troubled', 'still', 'joyous', 'mother', 'wife', 'having', 'stick', 'side', 'people', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'incarcerated', 'side', 'life', 'are', 'usually', 'unfit', 'have', 'children', 'raise', 'family', 'deal', 'regular', 'people', 'society', 'penal', 'system', 'once', 'get', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'troubling', 'deal', 'regular', 'life', 'will', 'not', 'hire', 'you.Needless', 'say', 'tragic', 'tough', 'not', 'too', 'ballsy', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'times', 'far', 'comedy', 'one', 'films', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Charles', 'Burnett', 'who', 'directed', 'Killer', 'Sheep', 'when', 'film', 'school', 'years', 'two', 'films', 'follow', 'similar', 'aesthetic', 'being', 'realistic', 'simply', 'done', 'would', 'be', 'proud.', '34']",N/A
