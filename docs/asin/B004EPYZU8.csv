A number of story elements have been taken from that film. One thing that is interesting and I don't know whether it has come out of the interest in trying to explain 'Inception', is that people are now trying to explain this film.This could be a deliberate ploy of writing a story like that - hoping it will be interpreted as having different levels and that moviegoers are both ready for and want that.A few other things can be true:One - the film isn't that interesting and doesn't work at all, apart from the action scenes.Two - the film is very simple to understand and people are trying to make it seem like there was more going on by being intellectual about it.Three - it's just entertainment and none of the above matters anyway.The film was made for Blu-Ray, there is no doubt of that. The visuals and production design are something else entirely.However, I will agree that it is depressing and disturbing once you begin to put together what may not have been happening on screen to the main character, who is apparently a dancer (though we do not see this on screen). I did notice that Doctor Gorski (the mental health professional) looks very sad after the main character's 'dance' performances - this is not out of admiration for what we do not see, but rather seems to be because she knows what the dance REALLY represents. This may be because she is powerless to stop what is going on.The film could be about empowerment or loss/lack of power.I think for many the film was either a downer, was seen as sexist , had a confused plot and/or thought it was smarter than it was. Regardless, a lot of people didn't connect with it. It may have another life on home video. I will be interested to see how it is regarded in ten years.

And it's not Watchmen. Those are two phenomenal films based off of someone else's intellectual property. This is Zack Snyder's own, and in many ways it's unfair to compare Sucker Punch to those two films. What Sucker Punch is is pure exploitation; it's piled to the brim with over-the-top action sequences, and has as much fan-service as an old Burlesque film.Sucker Punch follows the Alice-in-Wonderland-like adventures of Babydoll, a twenty-year-old girl who is having the worst week of her life. Her mother has just died, and her and her sister must face a future with her stepfather. Babydoll's stepfather, a dispicable man, finds out that all of his wife's possessions were left to the two girls, and this sends him into a rage. The result of this rage puts Babydoll into a mental hospital where the orderlies have taken control. Now Babydoll faces lobotomy if she can't find a way to escape the hospital. The new world she enters completely envelopes her, and she begins her quest to find the items needed to escape her fate....Understand this about Sucker Punch: it's a fantasy film. That means suspending disbelief. A lot of the scenes are chaotic depictions of future or fantastic landscapes. Robo-Nazi-Zombies, Japanese demons, dragons fighting World War 2 era planes, and a future civilization on one of the moons of Jupiter can all be found in this movie. Zack Snyder takes a lot of liberties, and considering the themes of the story (rabbit-hole and mental illness), he does a fine job at conveying his action-oriented story.If you love 300 and Watchmen, then you should like Sucker Punch. It's filmed in the same style, gritty and oft-times violent. But if you're expecting 300 and Watchmen then no doubt you'll be disappointed. Sucker Punch's story is not a powerhouse. It's a means to drive the action of this film. It's not bad, it just isn't very substantial. Besides that, it's a very satisfying movie.

Seems our heroine isn't really that tough, mentally or physically in the real world, so she creates two separate worlds in her mind, that allows her to escape her real fate.

1400915,AIJOUSLU6MG26,B004EPYZU8,Balexander,"[1, 1]","I think the fact that I'm a psychology major lent me a different perspective than the reviews that I read prior to my ever seeing the movie.  I'm glad I endeavored to watch it despite the bad press.  Emily Browning who's stepfather kills her mother for her money finds that she's willed him out.  He turns to her daughters with the intention of apparently exploiting them.  She accidentally shoots her sister and he then throws her into an insane asylum.Asylum turned brothel with an evil orderly overstepping his bounds as the pimp running the show.  The girls are made to perform dances and then shag their clients.  The first time she is asked to dance she doesn't move (which symbolizes her refusal to open up and talk to the therapist - or the Madam) she's then told that she herself has all the weapons she needs to fight and that her fight starts now (translation - therapy can help you just have to want it badly enough to fight and regain your resolve).  The music starts playing again and in comes Scott Glen her &#34;Escape&#34; coach.  Essentially, he tells her what she needs to escape from the prison in her own mind albeit it's made to look as if she's attempting to escape the asylum itself.Every time &#34;Babydoll&#34; dances she's escaping this tortured reality she lives in.  She just lost her mother and killed her own sister and knows her stepfather arranged a lobotomy.  The adventures she runs off to in her head don't really involve anyone else only her chance to escape.  She essentially experienced 2 traumatic events one of which she was the direct cause of.  How do people cope with trauma?  In youth many will escape by dissociating which is psychologically speaking separating oneself from their own mind in order to keep away the horror/grief/guilt or whatever.  I'm speculating here but what appears to be going on is she did formulate a plan to escape (not entirely sure if they really did help her or not) but the reality that she has no one left and nowhere to go but the one person in the asylum that didn't belong was Sweet Pea (Abby Cornish). She helps her escape and &#34;be free&#34; but for her the only &#34;true&#34; escape she has is in fact the lobotomy because all that horror/grief/guilt and whatever else would be gone.I believe the trailer, like almost every trailer does, gave people the wrong idea about the movie.  They saw action and a bunch of women kicking (insert bad word here) and then they go see what promises to be an action packed kick butt movie.  So, much so that even if they realize what they were watching they were disappointed or they missed all the underlying psychological phenomenons that were occurring.  Personally, I believe it was brilliantly done and well met.  The vast majority of people will at some point experience a trauma (it doesn't have to be violent) which is so difficult for us to bear that we remove ourselves from it - aka dissociate.This was probably wayyyy too much for me to put in here but I'm hoping a different perspective might inspire people to watch a great flick.",5,Oh the bad reviews,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,3065,"['think', 'fact', ""'m"", 'psychology', 'major', 'lent', 'different', 'perspective', 'reviews', 'read', 'prior', 'ever', 'seeing', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'endeavored', 'watch', 'bad', 'press', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'who', 'stepfather', 'mother', 'money', 'willed', 'out', 'daughters', 'intention', 'apparently', 'exploiting', 'accidentally', 'shoots', 'sister', 'then', 'insane', 'asylum.Asylum', 'turned', 'brothel', 'evil', 'orderly', 'overstepping', 'bounds', 'pimp', 'running', 'show', 'girls', 'are', 'made', 'perform', 'dances', 'then', 'shag', 'clients', 'first', 'time', 'asked', 'dance', ""n't"", 'move', 'refusal', 'open', 'up', 'talk', 'therapist', 'Madam', 'then', 'told', 'weapons', 'fight', 'fight', 'starts', 'now', 'translation', 'therapy', 'can', 'help', 'just', 'have', 'want', 'badly', 'enough', 'fight', 'regain', 'resolve', 'music', 'playing', 'again', 'Scott', 'Glen', '34', 'Escape', '34', 'coach', 'Essentially', 'what', 'escape', 'prison', 'own', 'mind', 'made', 'look', 'attempting', 'escape', 'asylum', 'itself.Every', 'time', '34', 'Babydoll', '34', 'dances', 'escaping', 'tortured', 'reality', 'just', 'lost', 'mother', 'killed', 'own', 'sister', 'stepfather', 'arranged', 'lobotomy', 'adventures', 'head', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'involve', 'anyone', 'else', 'only', 'chance', 'escape', 'essentially', 'experienced', '2', 'traumatic', 'events', 'one', 'was', 'direct', 'cause', 'How', 'do', 'people', 'cope', 'trauma', 'youth', 'many', 'will', 'escape', 'dissociating', 'psychologically', 'speaking', 'separating', 'own', 'mind', 'order', 'keep', 'away', 'horror/grief/guilt', ""'m"", 'speculating', 'here', 'what', 'be', 'going', 'did', 'formulate', 'plan', 'escape', 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'really', 'did', 'help', 'not', 'reality', 'one', 'left', 'nowhere', 'go', 'one', 'person', 'asylum', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'was', 'Sweet', 'Pea', 'Abby', 'Cornish', 'escape', '34', 'be', 'free', '34', 'only', '34', 'true', '34', 'escape', 'fact', 'lobotomy', 'horror/grief/guilt', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'gone.I', 'believe', 'trailer', 'almost', 'trailer', 'gave', 'people', 'wrong', 'idea', 'movie', 'saw', 'action', 'bunch', 'women', 'kicking', 'insert', 'bad', 'word', 'here', 'then', 'go', 'see', 'what', 'be', 'action', 'packed', 'kick', 'butt', 'movie', 'So', 'much', 'even', 'realize', 'what', 'were', 'watching', 'were', 'disappointed', 'missed', 'underlying', 'psychological', 'phenomenons', 'were', 'occurring', 'Personally', 'believe', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'well', 'met', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'will', 'point', 'experience', 'trauma', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'violent', 'so', 'difficult', 'bear', 'remove', 'aka', 'dissociate.This', 'was', 'probably', 'wayyyy', 'too', 'much', 'put', 'here', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'different', 'perspective', 'might', 'inspire', 'people', 'watch', 'great', 'flick']",Sucker Punch

The whole opening sequence is essentially a 10 minute montage, and I wont give anything away but the opening action seems to be the most crucial part of the story and it is essentially glossed over.This movie had so much potential for me when I read about it, but it fell short in the story telling.  I was most emotionally attached to the movie at the beginning and spent the next 1.5 hours growing detached from the story.Compared to the other ""Teen SciFi"" which has come out recently (Push, I am Number 4, etc.)  this movie is far better in my own opinion.Bottom Line:If you are a fan of the stylistic action of movies like 300 and Kill Bill; or you want a a movie to test the limits of you stereo system;  You should definitely put this movie at least on your rental list.",3,"Visually Stunning, lacking in depth",1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,1167,"['sensory', 'overload', 'would', 'best', 'describe', 'movie.My', 'BR', 'Disc', 'Review', 'will', 'give', 'sound', 'system', 'workout', 'effects', 'images', 'are', 'word', 'Awesome', 'story', 'bit', 'convoluted', 'understand', 'taking', 'place', 'Babydoll', 'mind', 'action', 'place', 'real', 'world', 'not', 'properly', 'build', 'up', 'enough', 'understand', 'why', 'Protagonist', 'who', 'whole', 'opening', 'sequence', 'essentially', '10', 'minute', 'montage', 'wont', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'opening', 'action', 'be', 'most', 'crucial', 'part', 'story', 'essentially', 'glossed', 'over.This', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'when', 'read', 'fell', 'short', 'story', 'telling', 'was', 'most', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'movie', 'beginning', 'spent', 'next', '1.5', 'hours', 'growing', 'detached', 'story.Compared', 'other', 'Teen', 'SciFi', 'come', 'out', 'recently', 'Push', 'am', 'Number', '4', 'etc', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'own', 'opinion.Bottom', 'Line', 'are', 'fan', 'stylistic', 'action', 'movies', '300', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'want', 'movie', 'test', 'limits', 'stereo', 'system', 'should', 'definitely', 'put', 'movie', 'least', 'rental', 'list']",Sucker Punch

Miles ""DJ Warlock""","[1, 1]","Suckerpunch is one of those B movies that will end up being a cult flick, it's one of those types of movies they people love to watch again and again. Next thing you know after a fashion able amonut of time you stay hooked on it. The visuals are good (I'm a sucker for special effects). It is one of those sit back and just watch the flick. Don't go in with expectations or you will end up asking way too many questions about the logic of the movie. Some movies are made to entertain us  and ""Suckerpunch"" does exactly that. Although they killed off my favorite character with the train ride, all is forgiven.I enjoyed the fantasy scenes, I am hoping that Abbie and crew make a second part to this movie. I want our lead character to exact vengance on all her oppressors. That is why I am hoping for a sequel. I am sufferring from the ""I got more questions that need answering"" syndrome, and I am hooked on the visuals. I also like the music score I think it fitted the scenes perfectly.  The female characters were cool to watch during the fight scenes kinda Matrix like in the right places. So yeah, buy the DVD  and put it in your favorites section of your collection. The more I watch it, the more fun it is to watch, in it's predictibility. All you need are your favorite snacks, that comfortable chair or couch and it's on.There is nothing wrong with a little predictibily, especially when it is designed simply to entertain us for awhile. Suckerpunch succeeds in doing that, so I hope there will be a little more background in to the Wardens character, and the mean old fart who poisoned mom. if indeed there is a second movie made. I also want more of the fantasy scenes involving what the ""old fart"" is doing with his ill gotten gains, and and more on the dance teacher, hopefully our heroine gets even richer after she takes him out.

Many corney lines, a plot that is way to predictable, and a bunch of young girls in skimpy outfits.  That pretty much sums up the plot and movie.

1400953,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004EPYZU8,C. Sawin,"[12, 17]","Zack Snyder just hasn't made the same impact on me that he apparently has on the rest of the moviegoing population. I enjoy his work, but it always seems like there's something to be desired when his films finally fade to black. With Sucker Punch, Snyder isn't really looking to change the formula his films have become notorious for, but the storyline just didn't sit right with me. We know ahead of time that this is all taking place in Baby Doll's head? That's like knowing ahead of time that Teddy Daniels is patient 67 in Shutter Island. Oh wait, we kind of did and that still turned out pretty great. Sucker Punch is fairly disappointing on one hand, but mostly just incredibly entertaining on the other.The Zack Snyder formula mentioned usually just involves heavy use of slow motion while most of his films have a particular look to them like they're all sent through the same filter before reaching the screen while also feeling like they all taking place in the same universe. Snyder became notorious for his R-Rated films, but then broke that mold with Legend of the Guardians. Sucker Punch is Snyder's first PG-13 film, so don't expect a lot of gratuitous gore, endless strings of profanity or graphic sex scenes on spaceships that last an incredibly long time since there's none of that. If you're a fan of any of Snyder's work, Sucker Punch still hits all the same buttons that films like 300 and Watchmen did; the action sequences are still insane and the slow motion technique is used in a way that adds a bit of gusto to each scene it's used in. When the girls first arrive on the train and they're in the middle of trying to retrieve a kitchen knife, a gun is fired as we see the bullet bounce off and shatter a robot's head. The shell then flies by the screen as we hear the air in the room howl through the shell before it falls to the ground. So if you're a doubter of the PG-13 rating, it doesn't really affect much here.This film is like a man's action movie fantasy. It's like Sucker Punch tries to roll everything a guy would enjoy in a film like hot women, heavy gunfire, a mother dragon who basically makes explosions come to her, and enough insanity injected into its most adrenaline racing scenes to keep you talking around the water cooler for hours. It's like trying to combine Showgirls, the Dawn of the Dead remake, Dead Snow, The Lord of the Rings, and I, Robot into one movie. During that same train sequence, I could've sworn the score suddenly paid homage to Terminator 2. Sucker Punch makes sure to tickle all of the brain cells in your head that are still attached to action films from your past.While the film's charm mostly comes from its action scenes and the films they pay tribute to, the flaws in Sucker Punch aren't exactly minimal. The main one being that the film's constant use of music with vocals makes Sucker Punch feel like the director's cut of an extended music video. There are three songs used practically in full in the first thirty to forty five minutes of the film among countless others as the film progresses. The film also takes place within two layers of the mind in addition to what's actually happening in reality, which makes the film feel like a less complicated version of Inception. The plan that Baby Doll comes up with seems a little too grandiose for its own good with such little payoff at times. Do you really have to dance to go to another reality where you're fighting robots on a train while trying to disarm a bomb before it explodes all for nothing more than a kitchen knife? It honestly just felt like a group of guys got together and threw all their favorite action movies into a pot and created a film with an amazing looking incoherent film before coming back around and adding a story to it to try and make everything have some sort of meaning.At the end of the day, Sucker Punch is basically just a glorified music video with really spectacular eye candy. The film can also be considered a fanboy's wet dream. If you're a guy, Sucker Punch is practically guaranteed to at least touch upon at least one of the things you look for and love in an action film. Whether it's giant samurai warriors wielding Gatling guns, steam powered zombie soldiers, hideous orcs and fire breathing dragons, an overbearing clan of bloodthirsty robots, or the fact that you just like to watch scantily clad, young women annihilate their enemies with nothing more than a blade and an endless supply of bullets, Zack Snyder's latest probably has you covered. Sucker Punch may not be the best written film of the year, but it's an action film that can still be considered a hell of a lot of brainless fun.",3,Eye candy for your inner fanboy,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,4667,"['Zack', 'Snyder', 'just', ""n't"", 'made', 'same', 'impact', 'apparently', 'rest', 'moviegoing', 'population', 'enjoy', 'work', 'always', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'when', 'films', 'finally', 'fade', 'black', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'Snyder', ""n't"", 'really', 'looking', 'change', 'formula', 'films', 'have', 'become', 'notorious', 'storyline', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'right', 'know', 'ahead', 'time', 'taking', 'place', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'head', 'knowing', 'ahead', 'time', 'Teddy', 'Daniels', 'patient', '67', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'Oh', 'wait', 'kind', 'did', 'still', 'turned', 'out', 'pretty', 'great', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'fairly', 'disappointing', 'one', 'hand', 'mostly', 'just', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'other.The', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'formula', 'mentioned', 'usually', 'just', 'heavy', 'use', 'slow', 'motion', 'most', 'films', 'have', 'particular', 'look', ""'re"", 'sent', 'same', 'filter', 'reaching', 'screen', 'also', 'feeling', 'taking', 'place', 'same', 'universe', 'Snyder', 'became', 'notorious', 'R-Rated', 'films', 'then', 'broke', 'mold', 'Legend', 'Guardians', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'Snyder', 'first', 'PG-13', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'gratuitous', 'gore', 'endless', 'strings', 'profanity', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'spaceships', 'last', 'incredibly', 'long', 'time', 'none', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Snyder', 'work', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'still', 'same', 'buttons', 'films', '300', 'Watchmen', 'did', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'still', 'insane', 'slow', 'motion', 'technique', 'used', 'way', 'bit', 'gusto', 'scene', 'used', 'When', 'girls', 'first', 'arrive', 'train', ""'re"", 'middle', 'trying', 'retrieve', 'kitchen', 'knife', 'gun', 'fired', 'see', 'bullet', 'bounce', 'shatter', 'robot', 'head', 'shell', 'then', 'flies', 'screen', 'hear', 'air', 'room', 'howl', 'shell', 'ground', 'So', ""'re"", 'doubter', 'PG-13', 'rating', ""n't"", 'really', 'affect', 'much', 'here.This', 'film', 'man', 'action', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'roll', 'everything', 'guy', 'would', 'enjoy', 'film', 'hot', 'women', 'heavy', 'gunfire', 'mother', 'dragon', 'who', 'basically', 'explosions', 'come', 'enough', 'insanity', 'injected', 'most', 'adrenaline', 'racing', 'scenes', 'keep', 'talking', 'water', 'cooler', 'hours', 'trying', 'combine', 'Showgirls', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'remake', 'Dead', 'Snow', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Robot', 'one', 'movie', 'same', 'train', 'sequence', 'could', ""'ve"", 'sworn', 'score', 'suddenly', 'paid', 'homage', 'Terminator', '2', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'sure', 'tickle', 'brain', 'cells', 'head', 'are', 'still', 'attached', 'action', 'films', 'film', 'charm', 'mostly', 'action', 'scenes', 'films', 'pay', 'tribute', 'flaws', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'minimal', 'main', 'one', 'being', 'film', 'constant', 'use', 'music', 'vocals', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'feel', 'director', 'cut', 'extended', 'music', 'video', 'are', 'three', 'songs', 'used', 'practically', 'full', 'first', 'thirty', 'forty', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'countless', 'others', 'film', 'film', 'also', 'place', 'two', 'layers', 'mind', 'addition', 'what', 'actually', 'happening', 'reality', 'film', 'feel', 'less', 'complicated', 'version', 'Inception', 'plan', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'up', 'little', 'too', 'grandiose', 'own', 'good', 'such', 'little', 'payoff', 'times', 'Do', 'really', 'have', 'dance', 'go', 'reality', 'where', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'robots', 'train', 'trying', 'disarm', 'bomb', 'nothing', 'more', 'kitchen', 'knife', 'honestly', 'just', 'felt', 'group', 'guys', 'got', 'together', 'threw', 'favorite', 'action', 'movies', 'pot', 'created', 'film', 'amazing', 'looking', 'incoherent', 'film', 'coming', 'back', 'adding', 'story', 'try', 'make', 'everything', 'have', 'sort', 'meaning.At', 'end', 'day', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'basically', 'just', 'glorified', 'music', 'video', 'really', 'spectacular', 'eye', 'candy', 'film', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'considered', 'fanboy', 'wet', 'dream', ""'re"", 'guy', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'practically', 'guaranteed', 'least', 'touch', 'upon', 'least', 'one', 'things', 'look', 'love', 'action', 'film', 'giant', 'samurai', 'warriors', 'wielding', 'Gatling', 'guns', 'steam', 'powered', 'zombie', 'soldiers', 'hideous', 'orcs', 'fire', 'breathing', 'dragons', 'overbearing', 'clan', 'bloodthirsty', 'robots', 'fact', 'just', 'watch', 'scantily', 'clad', 'young', 'women', 'annihilate', 'enemies', 'nothing', 'more', 'blade', 'endless', 'supply', 'bullets', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'latest', 'probably', 'covered', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'written', 'film', 'year', 'action', 'film', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'considered', 'hell', 'lot', 'brainless', 'fun']",Sucker Punch

1400958,A2UFDTU7YDAE0D,B004EPYZU8,Dan J. Dunn,"[9, 17]","The critical response to Sucker Punch depressed me.  They just SAVAGED this movie, as if they had all received instructions to ""kill this film.""  You see, I loved this movie so much when I saw it that I couldn't believe that the reviews were real.  I had this bizarre feeling that I was dreaming.Which brings up an interesting point, considering that this movie is a dream.Sucker punch is not a realistic film.  It's not supposed to be.  It's a dream-scape.  The characters are dream characters, in a dream that *somebody* is dreaming--but who?  I could say that ""you"" are dreaming but that's not a precise use of language.  There is not some other person, some ""you,"" doing the dreaming.  I am the dreamer.  I am dreaming and the characters in Sucker Punch are dream characters in my dream.  There is no ""reality"" in the movie Sucker Punch (just as there is no reality in any movie).  But, in a way, there is MORE reality in Sucker Punch than the average film.  I'm dreaming it, after all, and within the context of the dream whatever I experience is as real as any other experience (or pain), just as long as I don't get hung up on the existence of ""others"" who really don't matter, anyway.In some films, it is my job to feel sympathy for, and compassion towards, the characters in the movie.  That's my ""job"" as a member of the audience.  But in Sucker Punch I have a different job to do.  I shouldn't walk out of the theater with the impression that I saw a movie that tried to get me to care about the characters when it did no such thing.The movies, in general, are dream-like. Sucker Punch takes that idea and runs with it.  As I watch the film, I am dreaming.  I am a person called ""Baby Doll"" and I am fighting dragons and also living in multiple worlds where I win wars, perform some kind of exotic dance, get institutionalized and eventually lobotomized.  I rescue my friends and they rescue me.  There are villains and heroes.  I even have the ability to ""jump"" from one identity to another.  Not all of the dream is ""fun.""  Some parts are nightmarish.And then I wake up.  The lights come up in the theater.  I leave the cocoon and step outside.  Now I have to ask myself if I have learned anything from the dream.  The dream told me that I should have total victory.  Total and complete.  So do I?  I do if I ""control this world.""  If the world I inhabit is another dream, then what happens to me in it is a product of my mind.  I will experience in this world what I expect to experience.  No more and no less.So what do I expect?  If I expect to be afraid and be defeated, then I will be.  But if I expect to be unafraid and undefeated, I will be.  I have all the weapons I need.  Now it's up to me to fight.  The film may (or may not) ""bleed"" into my ""real life"" in the way that some dreams do.  That's a pretty impressive piece of film-making, in my opinion, and Zack Snyder should be congratulated for it.The above interpretation of this film is not a conventional one.  I know this.  But I don't know why it can't be a valid one and leave anyone who sees this movie with the choice to accept that this film is a step further along the evolution of film from ""story telling"" through ""thrill ride"" to ""guided dream"" to ""lucid dream.""  Sucker Punch is a guided dream intended to unfold in my mind.  It is different from a ""story-telling film"" but it is not a lucid dream experience, but it is a step in that direction.  At some point in the future, movies will be ""interactive"" and the video game and movie will be one and the same--providing us with the opportunity to experience a lucid dream while fully awake, and take one more step towards the experience of an alternative, virtual reality.The objection to the idea of ""movies as guided dreaming"" is that, after all, we are accustomed to seeing a film as a story.  We peek into another person's life and, as voyeurs, we enjoy watching them.  Disbelief is suspended and we are tricked through the magic of film into believing that we are seeing ""real people"" and so we have an emotional response to them and their story--but this is not what Sucker Punch is.  Sucker Punch is not intended to ""make you think"" it is an experience that you have, not something you look at and interpret.  The only difficulty Zack Snyder had in putting this on screen is that the technology doesn't really exist (yet) to give the viewer the physical experience of the characters on screen.  When that does occur (and it will) then we'll have a true ""mind bending"" experience and we'll see where Sucker Punch has led us, for good or evil.Sucker Punch is going to go down in history as a noble experiment that failed financially.  It will also be seen as the event that demonstrated (once again) that ""the critics"" can be very, very wrong.",5,"Oh Lord, Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood!",1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,4787,"['critical', 'response', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'depressed', 'just', 'SAVAGED', 'movie', 'had', 'received', 'instructions', 'kill', 'film', 'see', 'loved', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'saw', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'reviews', 'were', 'real', 'had', 'bizarre', 'feeling', 'was', 'dreaming.Which', 'up', 'interesting', 'point', 'considering', 'movie', 'dream.Sucker', 'punch', 'not', 'realistic', 'film', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'dream-scape', 'characters', 'are', 'dream', 'characters', 'dream', '*somebody*', 'dreaming', 'who', 'could', 'say', 'are', 'dreaming', 'not', 'precise', 'use', 'language', 'not', 'other', 'person', 'doing', 'dreaming', 'am', 'dreamer', 'am', 'dreaming', 'characters', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'are', 'dream', 'characters', 'dream', 'reality', 'movie', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'just', 'reality', 'movie', 'way', 'MORE', 'reality', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'average', 'film', ""'m"", 'dreaming', 'context', 'dream', 'experience', 'as', 'real', 'other', 'experience', 'pain', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hung', 'up', 'existence', 'others', 'who', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'anyway.In', 'films', 'job', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'compassion', 'towards', 'characters', 'movie', 'job', 'member', 'audience', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'have', 'different', 'job', 'do', 'should', ""n't"", 'walk', 'theater', 'impression', 'saw', 'movie', 'tried', 'get', 'care', 'characters', 'when', 'did', 'such', 'thing.The', 'movies', 'general', 'are', 'dream-like', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'idea', 'watch', 'film', 'am', 'dreaming', 'am', 'person', 'called', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'am', 'fighting', 'dragons', 'also', 'living', 'multiple', 'worlds', 'where', 'win', 'wars', 'perform', 'kind', 'exotic', 'dance', 'get', 'institutionalized', 'eventually', 'lobotomized', 'rescue', 'friends', 'rescue', 'are', 'villains', 'heroes', 'even', 'have', 'ability', 'jump', 'one', 'identity', 'Not', 'dream', 'fun', 'parts', 'are', 'nightmarish.And', 'then', 'wake', 'up', 'lights', 'come', 'up', 'theater', 'leave', 'cocoon', 'step', 'outside', 'Now', 'have', 'ask', 'have', 'learned', 'anything', 'dream', 'dream', 'told', 'should', 'have', 'total', 'victory', 'Total', 'complete', 'So', 'do', 'do', 'control', 'world', 'world', 'inhabit', 'dream', 'then', 'what', 'product', 'mind', 'will', 'experience', 'world', 'what', 'expect', 'experience', 'more', 'less.So', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'expect', 'be', 'afraid', 'be', 'defeated', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'expect', 'be', 'unafraid', 'undefeated', 'will', 'be', 'have', 'weapons', 'need', 'Now', 'up', 'fight', 'film', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'bleed', 'real', 'life', 'way', 'dreams', 'do', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'piece', 'film-making', 'opinion', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'should', 'be', 'congratulated', 'it.The', 'interpretation', 'film', 'not', 'conventional', 'one', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'valid', 'one', 'leave', 'anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'choice', 'accept', 'film', 'step', 'further', 'evolution', 'film', 'story', 'telling', 'thrill', 'ride', 'guided', 'dream', 'lucid', 'dream', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'guided', 'dream', 'intended', 'unfold', 'mind', 'different', 'story-telling', 'film', 'not', 'lucid', 'dream', 'experience', 'step', 'direction', 'point', 'future', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'interactive', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'same', 'providing', 'opportunity', 'experience', 'lucid', 'dream', 'fully', 'awake', 'take', 'one', 'more', 'step', 'experience', 'alternative', 'virtual', 'reality.The', 'objection', 'idea', 'movies', 'guided', 'dreaming', 'are', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'film', 'story', 'peek', 'person', 'life', 'voyeurs', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Disbelief', 'suspended', 'are', 'tricked', 'magic', 'film', 'believing', 'are', 'seeing', 'real', 'people', 'so', 'have', 'emotional', 'response', 'story', 'not', 'what', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'not', 'intended', 'make', 'think', 'experience', 'have', 'not', 'something', 'look', 'interpret', 'only', 'difficulty', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'had', 'putting', 'screen', 'technology', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', 'yet', 'give', 'viewer', 'physical', 'experience', 'characters', 'screen', 'When', 'occur', 'will', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'true', 'mind', 'bending', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'see', 'where', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'led', 'good', 'evil.Sucker', 'Punch', 'going', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'noble', 'experiment', 'failed', 'financially', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'event', 'demonstrated', 'once', 'again', 'critics', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'wrong']",Sucker Punch

It totally enthralled me but it's box office was lukewarm at best as was the critical reaction.  The operative tag was style over substance.  It wasn't until it was released in the then burgeoning home video market that word of mouth made the film the classic that it's considered today.  This is not to suggest that ""Sucker Punch"" is in that same lofty category but to draw an analogy.  As memory serves ""Sucker Punch"" on it's release last Spring was met with hostile reviews and plummeting box office as word of mouth got out.  I think it's more of a case of dashed expectations.  The ad campaign led you to believe that the film was straightforward comic book fantasy, or, the filmization of ""Fox Force Five"", the fictional TV show from ""Pulp Fiction"".  Director Zack Snyder has attempted something ambitious here.  He melds psychological thriller, hyper-realism, and uber-fantasy seamlessly into a work that kept me rapt.  Snyder proved he was a master visualist with ""300"" but here he's attempting something different.  Most of the criticism I've seen says there's no narrative but nothing could be further from the truth.  It's a richly detailed stream of conscience narrative that requires close attention otherwise you miss the rewards it reaps.

I am of the opinion that a film can be good or bad as a FACT, but it's only YOUR opinion if YOU don't like it.  Get it?  Citizen Kane is a masterpiece, perfectly made film, but you may hate it.  That doesn't change the fact that it's a great film.  YOu just didn't get it or it just wasn't your cup of tea.  There is a criteria from which to judge films, varying for each genre and the specific film's intentions.  I would go into more details but it would take up the majority of this review. Some films are great or good whether you like them or not.  Battlefield: Los Angeles is not an inspired or even good movie, it's a fact, but for whatever reason you may like it or think it's one of your favorites.  Making any sense?  There's a reason why professional film critics are film critics.  They have standards, they have experience and a vast knowledge of almost every type of film to use as templates for anything they're hating or loving on.  Anyway.....I've only watched the unrated director's cut on blu ray all the way through.  I only skimmed the theatrical versionOkay, now on to Sucker Punch Zack Snyder's(Watchmen, Dawn of the Dead 04, 300) new epic fantasy film released last year to horrible reviews and even worse box office.  This film is the most upsetting of movies that don't work.  It actually has ideas and themes.  It just doesn't really get them through in a great way.  I've always said I'd rather see an epic failure by someone who is trying to say something or who is a REAL artist over some hackeneyed piece of corporate drivel(**cough, cough***Transformers III**cough, cough) without a soul or goal beyond the weekend's opening box office.  Sukcer Punch is a lot of things but it is definitely not a film made by committe with great corporate interests at hand.  It's way too much of a downer, loaded with as much physical violence as it is with mental violence.  And YES, I 'got' it.  It's not very oscure to get as some of the film's overzealous, and possibly in denial, champions would accuse this film's detractors of being.  There's no real twist to the story.  Right from the first five or ten minutes you know where you stand as a doctor hovers over our main character, Babydoll, with a needle ready to lobotomize her.  The movie never hides what's not real and what is.  There's no twist.  It states its case right off the bat.  That's also a problem of sorts.  The film goes into Babydoll's mind right before the puncture and it takes us to a brothel set in some fantasy world.  She is a new dancer set to be de-virginized by a 'high roller' in five days.  Of course she wants to escape before this but needs some help by some of the other likeminded girls around her.  Alas, her great gift is a magical burlesque dance, that we never see or experince, that distracts her captor long enough for her cohorts to get items they will need to make their escape.  Every time she goes to dance we go into a fantasy world within the fantasy world we're already in.  Get it?Here's the thing: every fantasy world within the fantasy are made up of pop culture scenarios influenced by everything from steampunk, war epics, Lord of the Rings, and anime.  We never see what her cohorts are doing to get the escape items in fantasy world number one, we just see action scenarios in fantasty world number two that sort of emulates the emotions and actions going on in fantasy world number one.  Yeah, I'm getting a headache, and no, this is not Naked Lunch or Inception, not even The Matrix.  While the action scenes are beautifully rendered and fairly exciting, at first, they all seem tedious and moot compared to what the ACTUAL plot is.  It's real visceral entertainment, and while I applaud it for that, I can't get over the fact that so much time is spent on action scenarios that have no narrative thrust, purpose or even flow when we are told they are all just fantasies to begin with.  And that's not counting the fact that the dramatic situation pre-labotomy fantasy is also TOTALLY made up and pointless at the end of the day.  I get what Snyder is going for and I appreciate his risk but he fails more than he succeeds.  To make matters worse by the third fantasy scenario you are bored and start to have the tedium of the whole thing sink in.  You don't care about the girls slaying a dragon or slo-mo fighting cyborgs delivering a bomb on a train.  You just don't because you've already been told that they don't really mean anything, and the whole time you're just wondering why so much time is spent in this fantasty number two relm.  This is the film's biggest problem.  While you may want to try and turn off your brain to this, you simply can't.  Sure, some audience memebers are simple and just like the explosions and effects, so they don't care, but these types of people aren't real movie lovers or fans.  They're just veg-heads who dig anything that's in the moment qualifying as 'KEWL' to them.  So, as a real movie buff and lover, who cares what they think anyway?  Just skim through all the over-praising reviews and you'll see what I mean.  They all talk about action, half naked chicks and special effects.  Not really something a real movie geek spends too much time talking about unless it's truly amazing and integral to the story, ala Jurassic Park, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Matrix, Inception, and many others.I say all this because I want to let you know that I may be over rating this film by a star and half due to my love of it's concept, tone and over the top visuals.  I love looking at this film.  I liked the whole concept while not really digging the execution.  This is NOT  a good film, but it's one I enjoyed and will watch over again for sure.  Zach Snyder is a Ridley Scott level visualist of the highest order.  His frames would make great stills.  He does things with visuals that hacks like Paul WS Anderson and Michael Bay wish they could do in their dreams.  Also, while his action set pieces are just as silly and over the top as a Bay or Anderson film, he knows how to compose interlocking shots and edits his films very well.  The action flows naturally and works for the most part.  ALthough, he should NEVER do slo-motion EVER AGAIN.  Actually, all directors should drop this as a tool of theirs when doing action with big effects.  Its become a parody of itself, and unless the director is trying to illicit laughter or groans through slo mo, I think it's beyond time to put it to bed for a while.  I was sick of it by the third Matrix sequel honestly.  Snyder has been quoted as saying that his upcoming Superman reboot(or whatever Hollywood calls movies that retread old ideas these days) will be lite to totally void of slo mo shots.  Thank god.  I admire and like this film to a degree.  I like what it was going for and the visuals are striking.  The first few action beats are truly fun but lose steam toward the third act.  You'll either love it or hate it, but it will never be a truly great or good film.I can't really talk much about the acting or the characters due to most of them not even being real people, but rather figments and pesonality traits of one girl wrapped up in a fantasy.  All the female actress look good and perform well enough, but there's not much to play outside of action posing.  Emily Browning, who plays the lead in all three realities, is very striking and has much charisma on screen.  She has got an exotic beauty that doesn't resemble any young actors of this era or the past.  I would like to see if she has the chops with a meatier role.  I will say that the soundtrack is awesome and integral to how the film works.  The score is interwoven with songs by Bjork and Brian Ferry among others to create a vibe that is totally unique.  I have the soundtrack and I'm a huge fan of the cabaret-esque version of Love is the Drug co-performed by the always stunning Carla Gugino.  It's a real show stopper, more so than some of the later action scenes.The blu ray looks and sounds great of course.  The special features are limited but they do include two features that make it worth it, the director's R rated cut and the Maximum Movie Mode that goes along with it on disc two.  The disc says that the R rated version is 17 minutes longer than the theatrical version, but I only skimmed the theatrical and only noticed two differences.  Firstly, the violence, while not more gratuitous, is more graphic(especially when some hero characters bite it towards the end), and some of the CGI laden action sequences have been added to in minute areas.  The biggest addition is at the ending with actor John Hamm(Tv's Mad Men) which was surprising to me, because in the theatrical version he seems to only show up for face time.  In the director's cut he plays a sort of salvation embodiment that lets the Babydoll character know that she can be free in an extended bedroom sequence in fantasy world number two.  It's a sweet and poignent scene but it's totally weird at the same time.  Why this was cut out of the theatrical version, especially with a name actor like John Hamm in the role, is beyond me.  Next up is the usually enteraining Maximum Movie Mode which Warner Home Video usually includes for its bigger blu ray titles.  It's basically the a behind the scenes doc that you watch simultaneously with the film.  Zach Snyder hosts, as he did for his director's cut of his much better movie Watchmen.  It covers everything from special effects, costumes, casting and set design.  Snyder also gives details regarding where the idea and the process of the scriptwriting came from, which may be interesting to fans and detractors alike.  Sometimes the info is played during the movie and sometimes the movie is stopped for docs and commentary.  I love this feature and I enjoyed watching this one for Sucker Punch.  The first disc of the blu ray has the theatrical version on it along with two other special features, both fairly useless.  First we get animated shorts that play as prequels or rather backstories for the fantasy heavy second realities.  They're not really animated but more on par with South Park style animation done by computers and very cut and paste.  They're pretty lame, and really only give vague backstories to what is behind some of the villains in the big action fantasy sequences.  Not really worth watching.  The most lame feature is the second one on this disc regarding the film's soundtrack and it's creation.  It's barely five minutes long and adds up to little more than a commercial for the soundtrack album. This a bummer considering how much work and thought went into the soundtrack from the composers to the pop songs chosen, most of which were sung by actress Emily Browning.  It's short and pointless.  For more in depth info regarding the soundtrack you're better off going to the Maximum Movie Mode feature on disc two.So, there you have it.  I'm totally over rating this film, but also under rating it considering that I did kind of like what it was and what it wasn't.  It's worth a peek as a rental.  Like I said you will either hate or love it.PS: Oh, yeah, Scott Glenn is in this movie too!  He's a really good actor that is totally WASTED in this film.  He shows up in each fantasy vignette as a Yoda-like character who guides our heroines and gives cliche'd lines(I think they're cliche'd on purpose though).  Nice to see him work, but I would have liked to see him more in this film....or any film.",2,"It's not great, or even that good, but I tell you, there's brilliance in it.",1309737600,"07 4,

1400969,A3CT2I82NPANNS,B004EPYZU8,Desiree Troy,"[5, 8]","I think most people have missed a very significant theme in this movie... Female empowerment and the struggle to fight male dominance.*The 50s were the height of modern day male control over society, which explains why the film takes place during this era.*Men use monikers such as Baby Doll and Blondie to objectify women, especially beautiful women. These specific names may have been more popular then than they are now, but they are still used in a derogatory manner. Over the course of the movie, the female characters refer to themselves by the same names but the tone is entirely different, this is something to pay attention to.*At the height of male dominance, women were expected to act as if they had no free will or opinions of their own, which explains the use of the highly torturous and disgusting procedure known as a lobotomy, which severs all connections between the prefrontal cortex and the rest of the brain, destroying the person's ability to make any sort of decision for him or herself. It effectively takes away their humanity and any ability to ever control their own actions or thoughts, to experience happiness or sadness... making them as empty as a doll.*The action packed scenes that we see that take place during Baby Doll's dances, I believe, signify dissociative states. For those who do not study psychology, true dissociation occurs when a person has been severely, repeatedly, traumatized. Dr. Gorski's use of music seems to be a tool to help the girls escape the objectification, humiliation, mental and physical abuse, and possible rape (there is only one rape attempt we see but the underlying themes seem to suggest this may be a possibility or accepted practice by the men who visit the girls to see them dance). If this was the case, this is not what true dissociation is like, however it is the best explanation for the cuts from her dancing to the fight scenes. Also, in dissociation, personalities can be created over time to protect the person experiencing the trauma and these personalities are very protective of the traumatized person. If you know anything about dissociative identity disorder, then you understand what I'm saying.*Of course, it's unlikely that a young girl in the 50s would fantasize about elaborate fight scenes and flying about in a helicopter, but that's not the point of the film. Those elaborate fight scenes show young women fighting men who are holding them prisoner and trying to dehumanize them. They are very well done visually and the metaphors are amazing.*The outfits worn by the female characters also prove the key theme of female empowerment. Many women might disagree with me, but as a woman who has never worn a skirt or dress in her life, I think I can safely say that skimpy skirts and low cut shirts are not just about one thing. Strong, powerful women wear high heels every day and enjoy showing off their legs, muscles, breasts, etcetera. This is a choice that a lot of women make because it is their bodies and, again, their *choice*. They do not do it because a man expects them to. In the film, the female characters are shown wearing skimpy outfits during most scenes and the main character, Baby Doll, is seen in pigtails. Tools of male objectification sure. However, in the fight scenes where female empowerment is an obvious theme, they are still shown in these outfits and, Baby Doll, with the same hairstyle. Why? Because women have come a very long way in taking back what male dominance has forced upon us for so long. It is not degrading to wear a short skirt or pigtails. It's a sign of female power to fight back using the very things men use to hold us down.*In fact, it's degrading to make assumptions about women based on these things and it's disappointing when women fight against each other using these things as a way to hurt one another. Trust between women is also a substantial theme.Overall, this is an incredible movie. I had low expectations going in because I had heard the storyline wasn't very strong. I disagree. This movie was created to make you think and not just about one thing. Go into it with an open mind, as you should with everything, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",5,Female empowerment.,1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,4202,"['think', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'missed', 'very', 'significant', 'theme', 'movie', 'Female', 'empowerment', 'struggle', 'fight', 'male', 'dominance', '50s', 'were', 'height', 'modern', 'day', 'male', 'control', 'society', 'why', 'film', 'place', 'era', '*Men', 'use', 'monikers', 'such', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'Blondie', 'objectify', 'women', 'especially', 'beautiful', 'women', 'specific', 'names', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'popular', 'then', 'are', 'now', 'are', 'still', 'used', 'derogatory', 'manner', 'course', 'movie', 'female', 'characters', 'refer', 'same', 'names', 'tone', 'entirely', 'different', 'something', 'pay', 'attention', '*At', 'height', 'male', 'dominance', 'women', 'were', 'expected', 'act', 'had', 'free', 'will', 'opinions', 'own', 'use', 'highly', 'torturous', 'disgusting', 'procedure', 'known', 'lobotomy', 'connections', 'prefrontal', 'cortex', 'rest', 'brain', 'destroying', 'person', 'ability', 'make', 'sort', 'decision', 'effectively', 'away', 'humanity', 'ability', 'ever', 'control', 'own', 'actions', 'thoughts', 'experience', 'happiness', 'sadness', 'making', 'as', 'empty', 'doll', '*The', 'action', 'packed', 'scenes', 'see', 'take', 'place', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'dances', 'believe', 'signify', 'dissociative', 'states', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'study', 'psychology', 'true', 'dissociation', 'when', 'person', 'been', 'severely', 'repeatedly', 'traumatized', 'Dr.', 'Gorski', 'use', 'music', 'be', 'tool', 'help', 'girls', 'escape', 'objectification', 'humiliation', 'mental', 'physical', 'abuse', 'possible', 'rape', 'only', 'one', 'rape', 'attempt', 'see', 'underlying', 'themes', 'seem', 'suggest', 'may', 'be', 'possibility', 'accepted', 'practice', 'men', 'who', 'visit', 'girls', 'see', 'dance', 'was', 'case', 'not', 'what', 'true', 'dissociation', 'however', 'best', 'explanation', 'cuts', 'dancing', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Also', 'dissociation', 'personalities', 'can', 'be', 'created', 'time', 'protect', 'person', 'experiencing', 'trauma', 'personalities', 'are', 'very', 'protective', 'traumatized', 'person', 'know', 'anything', 'dissociative', 'identity', 'disorder', 'then', 'understand', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', '*Of', 'course', 'unlikely', 'young', 'girl', '50s', 'would', 'fantasize', 'elaborate', 'fight', 'scenes', 'flying', 'about', 'helicopter', 'not', 'point', 'film', 'elaborate', 'fight', 'scenes', 'show', 'young', 'women', 'fighting', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'holding', 'prisoner', 'trying', 'dehumanize', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'visually', 'metaphors', 'are', 'amazing', 'outfits', 'worn', 'female', 'characters', 'also', 'prove', 'key', 'theme', 'female', 'empowerment', 'Many', 'women', 'might', 'disagree', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'worn', 'skirt', 'dress', 'life', 'think', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'skimpy', 'skirts', 'low', 'cut', 'shirts', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'Strong', 'powerful', 'women', 'wear', 'high', 'heels', 'day', 'enjoy', 'showing', 'off', 'legs', 'muscles', 'breasts', 'etcetera', 'choice', 'lot', 'women', 'make', 'bodies', 'again', '*choice*', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'man', 'film', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'shown', 'wearing', 'skimpy', 'outfits', 'most', 'scenes', 'main', 'character', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'seen', 'pigtails', 'Tools', 'male', 'objectification', 'sure', 'However', 'fight', 'scenes', 'where', 'female', 'empowerment', 'obvious', 'theme', 'are', 'still', 'shown', 'outfits', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'same', 'hairstyle', 'Why', 'women', 'have', 'come', 'very', 'long', 'way', 'taking', 'back', 'what', 'male', 'dominance', 'forced', 'so', 'long', 'not', 'degrading', 'wear', 'short', 'skirt', 'pigtails', 'sign', 'female', 'power', 'fight', 'back', 'using', 'very', 'things', 'men', 'use', 'hold', 'down', '*In', 'fact', 'degrading', 'make', 'assumptions', 'women', 'based', 'things', 'disappointing', 'when', 'women', 'fight', 'other', 'using', 'things', 'way', 'hurt', 'one', 'Trust', 'women', 'also', 'substantial', 'theme.Overall', 'incredible', 'movie', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'going', 'had', 'heard', 'storyline', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'strong', 'disagree', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'make', 'think', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'Go', 'open', 'mind', 'should', 'everything', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised']",Sucker Punch
1400970,AU32ZJ0LGMBSA,B004EPYZU8,"dgdbear ""David""","[7, 12]","Zack Snyder has got to be one of the more ambitious directors around today. After doing a decent job retelling George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, making an awesome graphic novel-to-movie interpretation of 300, to making the love-or-hate, also graphic novel turned movie in The Watchmen; Zack Snyder has a good reputation of having style, if nothing else. But how does his own, original work fare? Well for most, not so well. Most have made plenty of comparisons to Inception and The Matrix. However, Snyder set out to make one thing: a movie that was to be fun, loud, and completely insane...and that's what he delivered. Is it original, no, but it is a fun movie that has some stellar action scenes with cool use of slow-motion. Outside of the action, the interpersonal stories of Babydoll, Sweet Pea, Rocket, Amber, and Blondie work for this type of movie. While the story isn't perfect, and has some plot holes, this is infinitely times better than some movie Hollywood puts out today. Style wins over substance with Sucker Punch, and sometimes, that's all a movie needs.*The Extended Cut ( original R-rated version ) doesn't add much to the movie. You get an extra scene with Rocket and Babydoll, a couple extended fight scenes, and a more robust ending ( just because of the extra footage of the High Roller and Babydoll )PQ- as with most Warner Bros. titles, Sucker Punch is a stunner. Reference material? Just about. When the girls are in the asylum, the colors are clear, but sometimes look a bit flat, skin tones look a bit pale, and grain occasionally rears (to some's taste, but not mine) its ugly head. I know that this is probably how Snyder wanted it to look, given the atmosphere. However, when the Babydoll an the other girls are in the fantasy worlds, LOOK OUT! Mainly due to the ambient pieces being CGI, and different cameras being in use, colors are bright, clear, and this shows the quality of Blu-ray. Black levels are dark without being indistinguishable, skin tones are spot on, and grain is a no-show. Overall, when watching this in a theater with a digital projector, I was blown away. Watching this at home on a 1080p t.v., I am speechless.AQ- lossless audio, what a friend you are when watching a movie like this. Speech levels were perfect, gunshots were loud, and explosions will shake your speakers. Even the music that played in the background had awesome delivery. What else can I say. Even if you hate the movie, the sound field should make you a happy camper.Extras- surprisingly light, but at the same time, informative. You have 4 animated shorts corresponding to the 4 different fantasy worlds that average around 2.5 minutes long. While neat with their motion comic design, they really didn't add anything to the main story, and while they are prequels to Babydoll and co.'s story, again, they could have been left out. Then there is an inside look at the soundtrack to Sucker Punch, which in essence, is a documentary on the atmosphere and the style of music they play. Although finding out Emily Browning, who played Babydoll, sang a few songs in the movie was really neat.Overall, like The Watchmen, Sucker Punch will be a love/hate movie. I loved it, especially the actions scenes because they were fast, loud, and adrenaline-pumping. If you go into this movie expecting the next Nolan or Spielberg masterpiece, you will quickly be disappointed.

Hager,"[1, 1]","On seeing the theatrical trailers, I remember thinking &#34;That chain gun wielding samurai looks pretty cool&#34; but that the movie just sort of looked like it would be a loud mess. Decided to skip seeing it in the theatre (sadly, much pickier about which movies I'll see in the theatre than I was 20 years ago).I ended up catching the movie on cable and was really surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's not a great movie by any stretch, but it's eye and ear candy. Some of the imagery & action sequences are really just amazing to watch and I greatly enjoyed the soundtrack paired with the visuals. I liked it enough that I bought the BlueRay so I could see it in full high definition with great sound - and I was NOT disappointed.I convinced my wife to watch with me and her review was &#34;It's like a teenage boy's fantasy come to life.&#34; She didn't exactly dislike it and there were elements that she did like (some of the music and, again, some of the imagery). However, the long action sequences definitely did not have the same draw for her.Perhaps a good litmus test of whether you should spend the time/money on this movie: Does the idea of a slight, sword wielding woman fighting 3 giant samurai make you think &#34;neat&#34; or does it make you groan?Personally, I enjoyed the soundtrack (particularly the new versions of &#34;Sweet Dreams,&#34; &#34;White Rabbit&#34; and &#34;Where is my Mind&#34; enough that I also bought the soundtrack.",4,Better than I expected,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,1461,"['seeing', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'remember', 'thinking', '34', 'chain', 'gun', 'wielding', 'samurai', 'pretty', 'cool', '34', 'movie', 'just', 'sort', 'looked', 'would', 'be', 'loud', 'mess', 'Decided', 'skip', 'seeing', 'theatre', 'sadly', 'much', 'pickier', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'see', 'theatre', 'was', '20', 'years', 'ago', '.I', 'ended', 'up', 'catching', 'movie', 'cable', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'stretch', 'eye', 'ear', 'candy', 'imagery', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'amazing', 'watch', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'soundtrack', 'paired', 'visuals', 'liked', 'bought', 'BlueRay', 'could', 'see', 'full', 'high', 'definition', 'great', 'sound', 'was', 'NOT', 'disappointed.I', 'convinced', 'wife', 'watch', 'review', 'was', '34', 'teenage', 'boy', 'fantasy', 'come', 'life.', '34', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'dislike', 'were', 'elements', 'did', 'like', 'music', 'again', 'imagery', 'However', 'long', 'action', 'sequences', 'definitely', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'draw', 'her.Perhaps', 'good', 'litmus', 'test', 'should', 'spend', 'time/money', 'movie', 'idea', 'slight', 'sword', 'wielding', 'woman', 'fighting', '3', 'giant', 'samurai', 'make', 'think', '34', '34', 'make', 'groan', 'Personally', 'enjoyed', 'soundtrack', 'particularly', 'new', 'versions', '34', 'Sweet', 'Dreams', '34', '34', 'White', 'Rabbit', '34', '34', 'Where', 'Mind', '34', 'also', 'bought', 'soundtrack']",Sucker Punch

Watching them defy gravity while kicking some serious CGI arse--while scantily clad, mind you--does wonders for one's libido.  However, the onslaught of eye candy that is the essence of SUCKER PUNCH brings beauty but no substance; this sweet tooth fantasy causes cavities.  Sure, it's a graphic novel brought to the silver screen, but it still fails to deliver any modicum of stability or sensibility.  This belly wobbler is nonstop nonsense that wreaks havoc on suspension of disbelief; it's hard to enjoy all the aesthetic goodies while constantly rolling one's eyes.Told from the point of view of Babydoll (a platinum blonde Browning), we are privy to the mental unraveling of a persecuted babe about to undergo a lobotomy in a mental asylum.  And the asylum suddenly becomes some sort of surreal brothel, and while Babydoll enchants onlookers while dancing (and we never see the dances) she imagines herself and her fellow femme fatales battling dragons and robotic Samurai and zombies and every nutty thing in between; so the story is an illusion of an illusion of an illusion.  As additions to the super hawt babe cast we find a misused Scott Glenn and underwhelming Oscar Isaac and Carla Gugino (sporting a Russian accent, for cryin' out loud).  The visuals and CGI effects are impressive, yet cannot overcome a lame pizza story with a goofball ending; SUCKER PUNCH at least gets two stars for suckering me to watch the entire fiasco--eye candy and all.--D.

The film starts with a few minutes of really beautiful, moody dark imagery by cinematographer Larry Fong, lovely and striking and extremely well done. Then we get into the 'plot' line, which is just ridiculous, with stiff amateurish dialog, almost a parody of a bad movie. Next we have the 'action' sequences, which are computer animated in the style of video games, with Steampunk Nazi Zombies thrown in. Hard not to laugh. It's all pasted together with some incomprehensible bits of 'philosophy' from the mind of the director, so pathetically stupid that it defies comment. Filmaker Zach Snyder has some talent, but it's limited; he was given way too much latitude in this production. He started life producing TV ads for cars and never developed the intellectual capacity for a feature film. He has a lot in common with Michael Bey, with whom he went to school, and the ""Transformer"" series - mindless, loud and violent movies which nevertheless find an adolescent audience. If this movie had been just an extended music video, just the dream sequences and skipping the dialog and computer game stuff, it could have been memorable.And yet there is the soundtrack, which is very good, with some exquisite pieces of the highest quality. Emiliana Torrini singing ""White Rabbit"" is otherworldly and memorable, worth the price of the whole experience. So what gives with such an uneven and inconsistent mess of a movie? Drek like this shows us how Hollywood does business; they give an idiot like Snyder $20M to play with in spite of his incoherent thinking. The only explanation - they must think they will make money. The reviews here on Amazon are all over the place, from enthusiasts to those who feel that God owes them back the wasted two hours of their lives - but on the other hand there are 500 reviews!!

1400978,A28LF7R0AS5VQ5,B004EPYZU8,DP07,"[3, 5]","Can't say it better any other way, this movie is a day dream. We all experience them and they are usually created by what we want or have to do, and what inside us makes us do it, or not do it.Interestingly, this movie is much more complex that what many reviewers give it credit for. They think it is gratuitous and shallow.SPOILER ALERTThis movie is about the blond girl you see on the cover, who is the lead in the movie, BUT, the story is not hers. It eludes to this several times in the very begining, and throughout. The story is in fact about the least interesting character in the movie, Rocket's older sister. You won't pick up on this at all the first time you watch it, in fact, when blondy literally says this at the end, you'll just think 'Whatever, you're just pulling at straws now"". Believe me, watch it again and you'll see it is NOT her story! This is probably the biggest hurdle to make because by watching the movie, you're not thinking it's going to be hard to wrap around.END SPOILER ALERTI was surprised, I usually like Scott Glenn (think Silverado), but there was something about him that didn't work. I think it was a little bit of writing, and a little bit of how he played his character. Part of me thinks it is intentionally played hollow - because I know Scott's a good actor. He was so far off, I fail to see how that could have been wrapped.The effects are outstanding. Not only that, but there is an abundance of understated mindblowers - things that get lost in the mundane but are insanely awesome if you notice it. For example, there is a scene with three girls talking and they are all facing backstage mirrors. The camera is slowly going around them in a circle, and when it gets to the side, it keeps going - the scene completely flips, and the girls are still looking at themeselves in the same mirrors. But, it's done so low key, in a subtle way, that it's almost more mindblowing that they didn't make a big production out of it. I mean, if I was the guy you created that scene, I'd would have walked into the frame and said ""okay pause, did you just see that? Hell yeah that was me. Rewind this a couple times and appreciate that - BAM"".A GOOD RULE is to read reviews here and see if they think the movie is about the blond girl, then rule them out. Then look at the other movies they ahve reviews. Many reviewers here just want to rant or complain to show how large their vocabulary is and how much they seemingly know about everything.

Sucker Punch is no different, but for me, where it has a lot of style, it is missing substance.Browning plays Baby Doll, a young girl institutionalized by her abusive stepfather. She dreams an alternate reality in which she is in a dance hall/whorehouse, and devises a plan of escape. What makes it more crazy, is she creates another alternate reality, within the alternate reality. Whenever she is supposed to be dancing, she's actually fighting alongside her fellow inmates against hordes of demon Nazis searching for the things she needs to escape.I can see how writers Snyder and Steve Shibuya are trying to make something out of all of this, how we sacrifice for those we love, but it's just an excuse for a creation of another fantasy world where all the sexy girls are dangerous assassins, carrying big guns and samurai swords. They kill demons, fight a dragon, and blow stuff up.These action scenes are pretty cool, but as they exist as a coping mechanism of Baby Doll's incarceration in a mental institute, they are incidental and unnecessary. Just an excuse for action scenes.Ultimately, Sucker Punch feels like two different movies jammed into one.

1400984,A3S1YIQQW7AZO,B004EPYZU8,EMAN NEP,"[19, 33]","[NO SPOILERS]Before seeing this movie, I was fully aware of its low Metacritic rating. In spite of that, I decided to give it a try. After all, BATTLE: LA got trashed by critics and I found that movie to be not as bad as everyone said. Not only that, but I love airships, steampunk creations, WWII battles, fantasy novels, feudal Japan and photogenic women. You'd think this would be my perfect movie. I wish it was! . . . but it wasn't.The biggest complaint I heard for Suckerpunch were the slow-motion scenes. Honestly, the slow-motion didn't bother me one bit. In fact, it was actually a RELIEF to be able to see the action instead of feeling sea-sick due to shaky-cam techniques so jarring that you'd think that Jaws was holding the camera in his mouth during a frenzied attack.But while the slow-motion wasn't an issue, there were tons of other things that were:1) The movie uses slow-motion to make everything look ""cool"". Bullet cases raining down, huge monsters sliding across the ground, gravity-defying acrobatics that would make any ninja jealous. Unfortunately, it's not like we haven't seen any of this before, so it may not impress you for very long.2) There is almost no emotional attachment to any of the characters. When things happened to them, I felt as empty as the clockwork Nazis and robots that they killed by the hundreds.3) Baby Doll's surreal music-triggered worlds are certainly entertaining at times, but the harsh truth is that probably 2/3 of the movie takes place in a depressing asylum and boring bordello dance-school. In fact, it seems like the only way they could prolong this surreal world escapism was by resorting to slow-motion while fighting copious groups of enemies.4) Finally, I could have done without all the narrator-spoken philosophical questions used to try and4pass this movie off as ""intelligent"" and ""serious"". The ending, instead of blowing you away, bores you with admonishment. I thought this was going to be a mindless, surreal fantasy romp, not AESOP'S FABLES.ALTERNATIVES:If you like the ""Girl uses her imagination to replace reality"" plotline, then I highly recommend PAN'S LABYRINTH--a film with a far better story and engaging soundtrack.If you're into perverted chef's and weird characters in general, try Mervyn Peake's GORMENGHAST books. You won't find a more twisted chef than Abiatha Swelter.This movie tries to show that you can use the power of your mind to make realities more palatable.

1400991,A3JD8FDS3CO3GH,B004EPYZU8,FairiesWearBoots8272,"[2, 6]","Zack Snyder is very passionate about geek culture. That's very obvious from his cinematic body of work, (Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen). Sucker Punch, Snyder's fifth effort as director - he also helmed the 2010 animated film Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole - is a film that oozes that very passion. It contains everything that fanboys crave and is likely to have limited appeal outside of the ComicCon set. Sucker Punch tells the story of ""Babydoll"", a young girl who is consigned to a mental hospital against her will by her stepfather. While there, she re-imagines the institution as a cabaret dance club and conspires to escape with several other girls. Their attempts at escape become outlandish fantasy-action sequences in which Babydoll and the other girls are gun and sword wielding heroines.Sucker Punch is like a dream that a geek would have after a lengthy binge on video games, comic books and anime. It is a fantastical melange of action, science fiction and fantasy elements. You get the feeling that Snyder wrote the story by hanging out with friends and throwing out ideas. ""Wouldn't it be cool if she fought a 15-foot samurai with a machine gun??"" Pretty much any far-out idea that comes into Snyder's head turns up in the flick. Through the course of Sucker Punch's 110 minutes the audience bears witness to (in addition to the aforementioned fifteen-foot samurai) mechanical German soldiers and WWII dirigibles, a fire-breathing dragon and robots programmed with sick martial arts skills. Some of these ideas feel half-baked and, indeed, I did have that feeling about the movie as a whole; that Sucker Punch was a series of very cool scenes in search of a coherent story. The framing ""real world"" story of a girl in a mental hospital couldn't possibly compete with robots and giant samurai. The film does tend to bog down a bit in the dramatic scenes of the girls, Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung chit-chatting and discussing their plans.The movie is very well made. Visually, it's absolutely incredible. I literally cannot wait to pop in the Sucker Punch blu-ray and see this baby in 1080p. It has a video game look and feel which I'm sure where intended by Snyder. The colors are desaturated and the flesh tones tend to look very computer generated. Emily Browning's Babydoll in particular looks like she has just hopped out of a Final Fantasy game. The action sequences are amazing to look act and lots of fun, if a little too chaotic. Snyder's love for slow-motion fight scenes is once again on display here. Acting is about what you would expect for an action-fantasy film. Emily Browning, the human star of the movie, speaks very little and wears the same expression on her face as if she's about to burst into tears for the entire movie. Carla Gugino does some nice work as the madam/dance instructor/whatever and Oscar Isaac is an appropriately slimy villain.I do get the sense that there is more here than meets the eye. I do not think that Zack Snyder merely intended this film to be an empty excuse for cool action scenes, but on a single viewing any profound messages or themes eluded me. I'm not sure what to make about the opening and closing  gobbledygook voice-over about angels. However, I will be seeing Sucker Punch again and I will pay closer attention to the subtleties of this story in hopes to grasp any such profundity. Despite some misgivings, I had a good time with Sucker Punch and look forward to a second viewing. Warner Bros will be releasing an extended cut on blu-ray which I will view and possibly amend this review accordingly. Clearly this movie is not for everybody. Critical reviews have been understandably very mixed. As I said earlier, the movie is not likely to find an audience outside of the comics and video game crowd. Zack Snyder is trying hard to do something bold and outside the box and I give him much credit for that. Sucker Punch may not totally succeed as a movie, but at least it tries! If nothing else, it's a fascinating and enjoyable failure.",4,"Dragons and guns and warriors, oh my!",1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,4077,"['Zack', 'Snyder', 'very', 'passionate', 'geek', 'culture', 'very', 'obvious', 'cinematic', 'body', 'work', 'Dawn', 'Dead', '300', 'Watchmen', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'Snyder', 'fifth', 'effort', 'director', 'also', 'helmed', '2010', 'animated', 'film', 'Legend', 'Guardians', 'Owls', ""Ga'Hoole"", 'film', 'very', 'passion', 'everything', 'crave', 'likely', 'have', 'limited', 'appeal', 'ComicCon', 'set', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'story', 'Babydoll', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'consigned', 'mental', 'hospital', 'will', 'stepfather', 'there', 'institution', 'cabaret', 'dance', 'club', 'conspires', 'escape', 'several', 'other', 'girls', 'attempts', 'escape', 'become', 'outlandish', 'fantasy-action', 'sequences', 'Babydoll', 'other', 'girls', 'are', 'gun', 'sword', 'wielding', 'heroines.Sucker', 'Punch', 'dream', 'geek', 'would', 'have', 'lengthy', 'binge', 'video', 'games', 'comic', 'books', 'anime', 'fantastical', 'melange', 'action', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'get', 'feeling', 'Snyder', 'wrote', 'story', 'hanging', 'out', 'friends', 'throwing', 'out', 'ideas', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'cool', 'fought', '15-foot', 'samurai', 'machine', 'gun', 'Pretty', 'much', 'far-out', 'idea', 'Snyder', 'head', 'up', 'flick', 'course', 'Sucker', 'Punch', '110', 'minutes', 'audience', 'witness', 'addition', 'aforementioned', 'fifteen-foot', 'samurai', 'mechanical', 'German', 'soldiers', 'WWII', 'dirigibles', 'fire-breathing', 'dragon', 'robots', 'programmed', 'sick', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'ideas', 'feel', 'half-baked', 'indeed', 'did', 'have', 'feeling', 'movie', 'whole', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'was', 'series', 'very', 'cool', 'scenes', 'search', 'coherent', 'story', 'framing', 'real', 'world', 'story', 'girl', 'mental', 'hospital', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'compete', 'robots', 'giant', 'samurai', 'film', 'tend', 'bog', 'down', 'bit', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'girls', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'chit-chatting', 'discussing', 'plans.The', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'Visually', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'literally', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'pop', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'blu-ray', 'see', 'baby', '1080p', 'video', 'game', 'look', 'feel', ""'m"", 'sure', 'where', 'intended', 'Snyder', 'colors', 'are', 'desaturated', 'flesh', 'tones', 'tend', 'look', 'very', 'computer', 'generated', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'Babydoll', 'particular', 'looks', 'just', 'hopped', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'game', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'amazing', 'look', 'act', 'lots', 'fun', 'little', 'too', 'chaotic', 'Snyder', 'love', 'slow-motion', 'fight', 'scenes', 'once', 'again', 'display', 'here', 'Acting', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'action-fantasy', 'film', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'human', 'star', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'same', 'expression', 'face', 'burst', 'tears', 'entire', 'movie', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'nice', 'work', 'madam/dance', 'instructor/whatever', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'appropriately', 'slimy', 'villain.I', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'more', 'here', 'eye', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'merely', 'intended', 'film', 'be', 'empty', 'excuse', 'cool', 'action', 'scenes', 'single', 'viewing', 'profound', 'messages', 'themes', 'eluded', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'opening', 'closing', 'gobbledygook', 'voice-over', 'angels', 'However', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'again', 'will', 'pay', 'closer', 'attention', 'subtleties', 'story', 'hopes', 'grasp', 'such', 'profundity', 'misgivings', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'look', 'forward', 'second', 'viewing', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'will', 'be', 'releasing', 'extended', 'cut', 'blu-ray', 'will', 'view', 'possibly', 'amend', 'review', 'accordingly', 'Clearly', 'movie', 'not', 'everybody', 'Critical', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'understandably', 'very', 'mixed', 'said', 'earlier', 'movie', 'not', 'likely', 'find', 'audience', 'outside', 'comics', 'video', 'game', 'crowd', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'trying', 'hard', 'do', 'something', 'bold', 'box', 'give', 'much', 'credit', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'may', 'not', 'totally', 'succeed', 'movie', 'least', 'nothing', 'else', 'fascinating', 'enjoyable', 'failure']",Sucker Punch
1400992,A150QZUUQAN21X,B004EPYZU8,Fallout Girl,"[7, 16]","WARNING: SPOILERS!Don't tell me how ""deep"" it is and how ""I didn't get it"". If you dismiss the negative reviews on this film with a ""they didn't get it"", you're as close-minded and condescending as those who dismiss action movies on the assumption that action and CGI can't coexist with intelligent, good-quality films.I got it all right. And I guess it IS deep... Like the sludge in the sewers is deep.One reviewer said that this movie can only be appreciated by those who love videogames. I beg to differ. I'm a long-time gamer, but I'd rather suffer through a brutal migraine attack than watch this dreck again. There are actual games that deal with the subject of mental illness and imaginary worlds way better than this so-called movie (American McGee's Alice series, for example). Combined with mediocre acting and dreadful music, this movie is an absolute disaster. Yes, it has some very cool visuals and action scenes, but its visual beauty is completely smothered by its cerebral ugliness. It's all style over substance, poorly conceived and blatantly insulting to the viewer's intelligence. The first fantasy world tells us it's bad to exploit women, and the second fantasy world is a paragon of female exploitation. How does this work? It doesn't! Characters fly hundreds of feet into the air and slam into solid stone shattering it, with not a single bruise or scrape inflicted... Yes, I get it, I get it, it's a fantasy world, but seriously, if we the audience know no one's going to get hurt or killed, where's the suspense? Why should we care at all about any of them?How can anyone think of this movie as being ""empowering to women"" is beyond me. If anything, it's blatantly the opposite. An underage-looking, scantily clad, heavily made-up nymphet named ""Baby Doll"" who fantasizes about being a prostitute is not empowering to women. Yes, she and her girlfriends kick butt, but they do it in an adolescent male's fantasy world. To add insult to injury, the ""dance"" Baby Doll performs every time she enters this over-the-top videogame fantasy world is quite obviously a metaphor for her having sex with whichever man needs to be ""distracted"" (which is why the actual dancing is never shown). Yeah, nothing empowers a girl like prostituting/being raped! (Now, apparently, there's a plot line about the impending sale of Babydoll's virginity in the extended edition that tramples the sex argument... I haven't seen it, so I can't comment).It seems that very little thought went into anything here except ""we have to make it look hot to sell it to as many teen boys as we can"". If Snyder cared to do his homework, he would realize that the message this movie seems to promote (whether he meant it that way or not) is actually deeply insulting to abuse victims. The character gets to go to a ""happy place"" where she has power, because in the real world she doesn't have any. If you've ever experienced/survived abuse, it's heart-wrenching to watch, not because it shows the psychology of an abuse victim, but because it shamelessly glorifies it.Was Zack Snyder thinking about the viewers when he came up with the title for this mess?

There are many other reviews here, good and bad.However, if considering a purchase, I want to stress to be sure you order the combo pack, which includes the Extended Edition. (The theatrical and extended editions each come on separate Bluray Disks in the pack).I enjoyed the theatrical film when I saw it in the theater, but the extended edition flows much better and is a much more satisfying experience. I'm not sure how many people and critics who hated the movie in theaters will be swayed by the extended cut, but I think that most people who at least somewhat enjoyed the original cut will get much more out of the extended cut.For people who missed Sucker Punch in theaters, skip the standard edition and go right for the extended edition. It provides a much fuller experience and it's easier to understand than the cut down theatrical cut.It should be noted that the extended edition is Rated R, not NR. It is the cut of the film that the director had intended for theatrical release. The studio insisted on the movie being released as PG13, which is why we got the less satisfying, more confusing theatrical release. After watching the extended cut, I came to two very clear conclusions: The MPAA ratings board system is completely broken for giving the extended edition an R rating and the Studio made a horrible decision in forcing a cut that would prune the rating to PG13. It's beyond me how the deleted scenes would raise the rating from PG13 to R. It's also beyond me how the studio believed it would be better to have a somewhat ""crippled"" PG13, that really suffers from the cuts, rather than just going with the much better R rated version.Also, shame on the studio for not offering the extended cut on the standard bluray edition, nor in the DVD edition.

1401004,A13O1YCZCYT76I,B004EPYZU8,Greg,"[4, 6]","Well, I saw Sucker Punch.  I'm not sure how that happened, but here I am.  And I do feel like I've been punched.  I know I'm not the first to make that joke, but, seriously, what else could that title be referring to?  It makes no sense in the context of the movie, other than to say 'look out, audience, this is gonna hurt!'.Sucker punch is a perfect little microcosm of successes and failures and some more failures that encompasses everything that is good, bad, and awful about Zack Snyder as a film maker.  Unfortunately, though perhaps not surprisingly, it's much more bad than good.I think the worst of the problems are hinted at in the very opening; we have a slow motion, dialogue-less montage where we learn about our leading lady (Baby Doll is her name, more on that later) and her troubles with her... father?  Step-father maybe?  And the accidental death of her sister, resulting in Baby Doll's incarceration in some kind of very specific mental hospital for gorgeous and thin twenty-something girls who act like teenagers.  It was an interesting choice; the visuals are clear (if a bit juvenile) and it tells the story well enough.  The problems are that a scene like that never happens again, making it stylistically superfluous, and the following scene gives all the exact same information only spelled out for the audience in ridiculous detail.  Making the opening completely superfluous to telling the story as well.  That first scene of dialogue, after the opening montage, also goes out of it's way to rape logic, as evil step/dad and rapey orderly work out their nefarious plot to ice-pick Baby Doll's brain... right in front of her... while she stands literally in between them and an authority figure who could stop the whole movie if Baby Doll would open her damn mouth and take some initiative.  But she doesn't, she doesn't...I'm off on a little bit of a tangent, but I think it sums up the movie - overdone visuals, poor story-telling and a healthy dose of chauvinism masked as grrrrl power.The gimmick here, of course, is that we spend a bulk of the movie in Baby Doll's fantasy world.  ...or ALL of the movie, it's not really clear.  The main setting shifts from the asylum to some sort of fantasy, parallel bordello, with the same actors playing parallels of themselves.  There's no warning for this shift or explanation, it just sort of happens and deal with it.  And then, from there, Baby Doll slips into yet ANOTHER fantasy world whenever she dances for men; partly because she's escaping the horrors of something, but partly because it's painfully obvious that Emily Browning can't dance.I'm fine with this as a concept - the problem here is that the jumps are so artlessly handled that we have no idea how the fantasy world translates to the real world.  When they're peeling potatoes in the bordello, are they peeling potatoes in the hospital?  When someone gets killed in the double fantasy world, do they die in the hospital?  How?  Did they ever exist?  Yes, children can and do build thick layers of fantasy for themselves to escape trauma and abuse; so thick they can confuse it with the real world (the girls in this situation are a bit old for that, but whatever) but we, the audience, need to know what the stakes are and what the rules are at least in a general sense.  The oddball, action oriented ""missions"" the girls take in the double fantasy world are so loosely connected to their plan to get out of the hospital/bordello/whatever that they start to feel like seven or eight music videos strung together instead of a movie.I'm sure this concept could be done well... oh, wait!  It was!  InPan's Labyrinth, a movie of stunning beauty that expertly weaves a young girls fantasy's with her horrible realities and shows us clearly how one influences the other.Huh.  Maybe Zack Snyder should have watched that one first.I'm being negative, but it's not all bad.  There are some great performances by everyone except Emily Browning, especially the core group of girls except Emily Browning.  Most notably, Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone who are clearly working very hard for this retarded script.  Some of the actions scenes are very, very well done - I'm remembering the choreography in a battle in WWI style trenches, which is an excellent blend of gun play and close-quarters combat.  Pretty exciting stuff.  Also, and I mean this in the most sexless way possible, the girls all look incredibly impressive holding their guns.  Large rifles are heavy and awkward and the girls clearly went through a good deal of weapons training to look like pros and it really come across.  Very impressed, I was.Again, all that would be wonderful if they were trying to make one or two music videos.  It's not enough to hold up a movie.The awful icing on top, though, is just how grimy and sexist the movie feels.  I know it takes place in a world where these girls are abused (in a vague, non-specific, but probably sexual sort of way) but I'm talking in a meta sense, in an 'outside looking in' sense.  It's clearly a movie that was made so grown men could watch young girls in short skirts; the creepy part is that it pretends to NOT be that.  It's a movie where girls murder hordes of faceless monsters, but only in their fantasies to escape the real world where they're raped and used (if I understand what little subtext there is).  We're never actually shown them trying to solve a problem and, in the end, they utterly fail as Baby Doll is lobotomized and all but one of them end up dead (I think).  Spoiler's ahoy.  Hell, the character's don't even get NAMES, they get PET NAMES, like 'Baby Doll' and 'Blondie' and 'Sweat Pea'; you know, the type of things you'd call something you possess but don't think too highly of.  Again, I'm not saying these ideas couldn't work, but it comes across as an older man's masturbation fantasy that he's tried to dress up in a way that can be sold to young girls.  If that isn't creepy, I don't know what it.I'm being overly harsh, and in no way am I accusing anyone of anything overly rude or illegal.  But the movie is just such an artless mess of images and ideas that it's easy (and kinda fun) to nit-pick it to death.  I wouldn't call it lazy and I hesitate to call it stupid.  But it's certainly a craftless, jumbled... yeah, okay, stupid mess of a movie.  It's not a complete failure, but it really rides the line.And you know what the kicker is?  I can't think of anything else to suggest watching in its place.  The Kill Bill movies, maybe?  Seriously, I go nothing over here......Still feels like I've been punched, though.

But I thought it was thrilling and provocative.  Now.  Did I completely understand it?  Not even hardly.  And all I can say in favor of its originality is that it ""appropriated"" from interesting sources (especially anime, videogames and music videos) and made good use of them.  But it so excels in three specific features that I'm willing to forgive a lot, because these are features that matter a lot to me (if they don't matter to you, you might hate it):1) It is visually stunning.  That alone will never make me like a movie, but it sure can make up for some uneven performances and thin plotting--which ""Sucker Punch"" also contains.  But the look of the thing paved over enough other weaknesses that I could appreciate...2) ...an awesome soundtrack.  The action and eye-popping settings were well-wed to some wonderfully creative takes on classic songs from Queen, The Eurhythmics, Jefferson Airplane, and Bjork, among others.  It even closes, after some of the credits, with a fascinating little duet version of Roxy Music's ""Love is the Drug."" But what I've described so far only marks ""Sucker Punch"" as perhaps an appealing extended music video, on par perhaps with something likeHeavy Metal [Blu-ray]. What, for me, distinguishes ""Sucker Punch"" is its...3) ...surreal and complex storyline.  Did the ending undercut the entire meaning of the film?  I think it did.  But did it?  I don't know.  Was the story uplifting or nihilistic, or worse yet, messianic?  Again, not entirely sure.  And I love that.  It hasn't let me go yet.  I might end up realizing that I've been ruminating on nothing--that there is ""no there, there.""  But from where I sit right now, and trusting the director of the substantialWatchmen: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)as I do, I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and assume that it's worth some thought.  And to me that is the ultimate compliment that I can pay any film--that I don't immediately forget it the moment it's over.Those who hate ""Sucker Punch,"" I get it.

So she has 5 days to escape the asylum. Whilst inside she makes 4 friends - Amber (played by Jamie Chung), Blondie (played by Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (played by Jena Malone) and Sweet Pea (played by Abbie Cornish) - and with these 4 other girls concocts a plan to escape the asylum: they have to get hold of 5 objects - a map, fire, a knife, a key and a fifth, unrevealed item requiring great sacrifice - which will grant them their freedom. The plan to obtain these objects revolves around Babydoll doing a special erotic dance for Blue Jones (the director of the asylum, played by Oscar Isaac), distracting him whilst the other 4 girls retrieve the objects. We find that each time Babydoll does her erotic dances (which she presumably hates) she escapes into her imagination and we are transported to spectacular fantasy worlds where Babydoll and her 4 friends - guided by the mentor known only as The Wise Man - battle fearsome foes including fire-breathing dragons, demon samurai, advanced cyborgs and steampunk Nazis in World War II; questing in these fantasy worlds to retrieve the items they need to escape from the asylum in real life. And it is the fantasy parts of the film, with its superior CGI and kicking soundtrack that really make the film: these parts of the film where Babydoll escapes into a fantasy world in her own imagination are insane and brilliantly done with wonderful fighting moves from our 5 kick-ass babes and brilliant CGI and prevent this from being a boring movie. But will the girls' plan to escape the asylum succeed? You'll have to see the movie. Is the movie any good? I immensely enjoyed the fantasy sequences but the movie just didn't feel strung together as a coherent whole. Without the fantasy sequences the film falls apart and because it doesn't feel like a whole just isn't interesting enough. Blue Jones' character (the man who runs the asylum) is a nasty piece of work and because of him certain people die who shouldn't. We never see the supposedly amazing erotic dances that Babydoll does, presumably so that this film could get its 12 rating, seeming to imply that the subtext of this film was about the exploitation of women and the fight for freedom from exploitation. I'm not sure why the girls have the nicknames that they do, except perhaps to make the movie seem cool. And the fantasy sequences are cool but by the end of the film I felt as if I had eaten a meal that hadn't managed to satisfy my hunger. And the way events eventually play out in this movie is a cop out: what exactly was Zack Snyder (the film's director) trying to say? And why doesn't the main protagonist Babydoll talk for the first 10 or so minutes of the film? At first I thought she was mute! In the final analysis this film will be remembered for its fantasy sequences (clips from which make up the trailer). But these are not enough to make the film a coherent whole.

Also, it looks this way on the DVD cover, and after watching it I feel lied to and sick because of this abuse. In the beginning after her mother is probably murdered by the abusive father and when the young girl accidently kills her younger sister in a failed attempt to protect her from their evil abusive father, I hoped that she would at least kill this disgusting abuser but she doesn't and he then pays to have her put in a bleak mental institution, and this is when I knew this is not the light Action movie I believed it would be. I thought it might get better if she grows up to escape and kills her abusive father but she doesn't and it gets worse. The girls in the institution are in many ways further abused. Sucker Punch is a movie about young girls being constantly abused. The DVD cover should say Sucker Punch is about abuse. Even if there is a few scenes with girls in skirts, I could not even look at them as being attractive because of knowing how in the institution they are being abused by abusers and this abuse is sickening. The actors and animation scenes were ok, had it not been for the theme of abuse. Then some of the young girls after being exploited, manipulated, and abused, are killed and thus don't escape. I felt sucker punched by not knowing before that the main theme is young girls being constantly abused. Do NOT buy Sucker Punch.

1401045,AXOO7BPM22BDO,B004EPYZU8,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[10, 16]","Sucker Punch, starring Emily Browning, arrived with a lot of hype and more than a few expectations.  But when a movie starts making you wish you were watching Matrix: Reloaded, you're in trouble.We start out on a dark and stormy night with Browning's unnamed character in her room awaiting the inevitable bad news of her mother's death.  She tries to comfort her little sister, but Slimy Stepdad can't be more thrilled about this- until he finds out the girls are left all the money.  One too many drinks later he barges into Browning's room; she scratches his face and locks him out, so he goes after the sister.  Browning finds his gun and fires, missing but somehow taking out her little sister.  SS has her institutionalized at Lennox House for the Mentally Insane (sic) run by Dr. Gorski (Carla Guigino) and bribes the Head Intern (Oscar Isaac- King John from Robin Hood) to schedule her for a lobotomy.At a critical moment, Browning funnels her surroundings into an elaborate fantasy- much like Keyser Soze in Usual Suspects. Browning, now called Babydoll, re-imagines the institution as a burlesque club/bordello of sorts run by Blue (Isaac), while Gorski (Guigino) becomes the matron and dance instructor.  In this fantasy she meets the other girls- Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), her little sister Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung)- who seem to like spending all their time in fishnets and bustiers.  Babydoll then drifts into her own fantasy- sort of like Inception, a dream within a dream.  Here she meets the Wise Man (Scott Glenn) whose fortune-cookie advice sets her on the path.Back at the bordello, Babydoll gets the others to follow her in a lame scheme (it is a fantasy, after all) to collect five blatantly foreshadowed items to help them escape.  As each opportunity to collect these items arises, Babydoll returns to the Wise Man for a mission briefing, with the girls in tow.  Once engaged, they all strut around in even more stripper-riffic costumes, blasting the CGI scenery into hash as Babydoll guides them to their level achievements... I mean, objectives.  But their problems are far from over: one of the missions costs a girl her life even as Blue suspects trouble and confirms it from an unlikely source.This flick is built upon pop culture references and homages.  From Robocop to Terminator to Star Wars, Crouching Tiger, The Matrix and yes, even Kill Bill, this is pure Fanboy Fantasy from start to finish.  Snyder pushes all the buttons- hot babes, samurais, katanas, orcs, dragons, steampunk, kung-fu and other assorted bad-a$$ery are lovingly served up in slo-mo CGI closeups focusing on the Hot Blondes while the Token Asian and Sultry Brunette take up the background.  Problem is you'll be nodding to sleep waiting for the next sequence to happen.  The plot is nonsense, especially as you're practically told twenty minutes in how it's gonna end.  The only question that remains is how it all ties together, and it's pretty corny when it does.  It's not like you're expecting this to be a tour-de-force, but a little something to work with would've been nice.Even the soundtrack is a little grating.  While the soundtrack itself is smoking hot, the songs are inserted at the start of every fantasy sequence like markers, which at full volume got a little annoying (Hey- look what we're doing now! LOOK!  IT'S METAPHOR!!!).

1401047,A3CJKAXWFE7L8R,B004EPYZU8,"John Smith ""Bad Johnny""","[10, 22]","Sucker Punch was a long awaited film(at least since Christmas for me)especially after the endlless string of mediocre, dud films that were released this last summer through fall.I was hoping for more, but at the same time I wasn't entirely surprised when Sucker Punch didn't measure up to the hype of the trailer. Personally, I'm getting a tad tired of the ""alternate reality/mind game/Matirix"" plot driven films.Sucker Punch (as anticipated)was visually stuning, but it was largely left to the viewer to translate the rest of the film as it stalled and dragged on from one mission to the next.It seems that this film was largely depending on the ""exploitation"" of the female cast to ""sell it"" and fill in the blanks where the film lacked substance.When in doubt, dress a hot girl like a porn star,put her in lingerie or something else tight and/or revealing and have her dance around to maintaim the male audience's interest.Kind of like what I call the ""Michael Bay soloution"", except this film uses ""skin"" and allot of ""suggestion"" instead of bullets and explosions(although there is plenty of that too).Granted,I have to give credit where credit is due.It had originality and potential and some good art style/direction.It borrows heavily from ""Steam Punk/Heavy Metal fantasy and Samurai/Japanese film/animation, but the ""you have 5 tasks"" to complete plot and the mysterious,""only you know the answer to the riddle"" question to win your freedom has been done to death a hundred times.Boiled down to its basics, Baby Doll is sent to an asylum by her evil step father where the girls are used(or sold) I should say to the highest bidder as sex slaves and/or objects of affection.Baby doll creates her own fantasy world to win her freedom and escape for herself and others to ultimately keep from being labotomized. Guess what happens?I liked the the visuals, but a film being ""visually attractive"" isn't enough.Just because a film has fantastic CG and visuals doesn't make it an outstanding film let along an entertaining one.Often it played out(or reminded me) of some elaborate video game as the heroines pranaced around dressed up like Jappanese Anime characters and who (miraculasly) had super human strength and intricate knowlege of  martial arts and warfare. I know that was ""part of the fantasy"" and that being part of the gag, but it can only work for so long.In the end,I found myself wanting more from this film than it was capable of giving.Sucker Punch will be worth renting and certainly when released on Blueray and viewed on a large Plasma/LCD screen it will look great.However,if you are looking for a storyline that will keep you going, this one is left on auto pilot virtually from the begining hoping to bedazzle you with pretty faces,tight bodies,over the top action and CG. I wouldn't pay to see an evening show at the theater,and watching a matinee is really pushing it.The title itself has no realtion to the film at all,its just ""catchy"" and looks/sounds cool. What I can say is, ""don't be a sucker"" and pay to see it in the theater let alone buy the film when released on DVD.While I thoroughly enjoyed Sin City and 300, Sucker Punch can't deliver what is promised, not even on a strictly ""entertainment level"" which both 300 and Sin City were capable of doing. Simply put...""don't believe the hype"" because in the end, all it ends up being is just a cool movie trailer.",2,"Oh, and one more thing...",1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,3399,"['Sucker', 'Punch', 'was', 'long', 'awaited', 'film', 'least', 'Christmas', 'especially', 'endlless', 'string', 'mediocre', 'dud', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'last', 'summer', 'fall.I', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'same', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'surprised', 'when', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'did', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'hype', 'trailer', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'getting', 'tad', 'tired', 'alternate', 'reality/mind', 'game/Matirix', 'plot', 'driven', 'films.Sucker', 'Punch', 'anticipated', 'was', 'visually', 'stuning', 'was', 'largely', 'left', 'viewer', 'translate', 'rest', 'film', 'stalled', 'dragged', 'one', 'mission', 'next.It', 'film', 'was', 'largely', 'depending', 'exploitation', 'female', 'cast', 'sell', 'fill', 'blanks', 'where', 'film', 'lacked', 'substance.When', 'doubt', 'dress', 'hot', 'girl', 'porn', 'star', 'put', 'lingerie', 'something', 'else', 'tight', 'and/or', 'revealing', 'have', 'dance', 'maintaim', 'male', 'audience', 'interest.Kind', 'what', 'call', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'soloution', 'film', 'skin', 'allot', 'suggestion', 'instead', 'bullets', 'explosions', 'plenty', 'too', '.Granted', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due.It', 'had', 'originality', 'potential', 'good', 'art', 'style/direction.It', 'heavily', 'Steam', 'Punk/Heavy', 'Metal', 'fantasy', 'Samurai/Japanese', 'film/animation', 'have', '5', 'tasks', 'complete', 'plot', 'mysterious', 'only', 'know', 'answer', 'riddle', 'question', 'win', 'freedom', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'hundred', 'times.Boiled', 'down', 'basics', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'sent', 'asylum', 'evil', 'step', 'father', 'where', 'girls', 'are', 'used', 'sold', 'should', 'say', 'highest', 'bidder', 'sex', 'slaves', 'and/or', 'objects', 'affection.Baby', 'doll', 'own', 'fantasy', 'world', 'win', 'freedom', 'escape', 'herself', 'others', 'ultimately', 'keep', 'being', 'labotomized', 'Guess', 'what', 'liked', 'visuals', 'film', 'being', 'visually', 'attractive', ""n't"", 'enough.Just', 'film', 'fantastic', 'CG', 'visuals', ""n't"", 'make', 'outstanding', 'film', 'let', 'entertaining', 'one.Often', 'played', 'out', 'reminded', 'elaborate', 'video', 'game', 'heroines', 'pranaced', 'dressed', 'up', 'Jappanese', 'Anime', 'characters', 'who', 'miraculasly', 'had', 'super', 'human', 'strength', 'intricate', 'knowlege', 'martial', 'arts', 'warfare', 'know', 'was', 'part', 'fantasy', 'being', 'part', 'gag', 'can', 'only', 'work', 'so', 'end', 'found', 'wanting', 'more', 'film', 'was', 'capable', 'giving.Sucker', 'Punch', 'will', 'be', 'worth', 'renting', 'certainly', 'when', 'released', 'Blueray', 'viewed', 'large', 'Plasma/LCD', 'screen', 'will', 'look', 'great.However', 'are', 'looking', 'storyline', 'will', 'keep', 'going', 'one', 'left', 'auto', 'pilot', 'virtually', 'begining', 'hoping', 'bedazzle', 'pretty', 'tight', 'bodies', 'top', 'action', 'CG', 'would', ""n't"", 'pay', 'see', 'evening', 'show', 'theater', 'watching', 'matinee', 'really', 'pushing', 'it.The', 'title', 'realtion', 'film', 'just', 'catchy', 'cool', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'sucker', 'pay', 'see', 'theater', 'let', 'alone', 'buy', 'film', 'when', 'released', 'DVD.While', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Sin', 'City', '300', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'what', 'promised', 'not', 'even', 'strictly', 'entertainment', 'level', '300', 'Sin', 'City', 'were', 'capable', 'doing', 'Simply', 'put', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'hype', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'just', 'cool', 'movie', 'trailer']",Sucker Punch

1401050,AEOCEVUWO5B7P,B004EPYZU8,J. Page,"[18, 40]","I did not catch Sucker Punch when it was in the theater being shown in IMAX.  I had seen the lackluster reviews on Rotten Tomatoes but since I have enjoyed Zack Snyder's other efforts (300, Watchmen) I thought critics were just being particularly hard on him with this newest effort.I was wrong.From the very opening scenes this entire turkey of a movie simply stinks from beginning to end.  No amount of gorgeous women running around in skimpy outfits with huge guns and swords can change the fact that this movie has a terrible plot that barely makes sense, action sequences that look like they were pulled from some of the worst ""B"" comic books of the past decade, and acting that is just simply completely atrocious.Don't get me wrong, I like big spectacle movies that try to wow the audience with gorgeous visuals.  I LOVED Kick Ass!  I even thought Tron was decent because the visual styling was a masterpiece of light and color and the plot and acting, while sub-par were at least watchable.  Sucker Punch though is in a whole other category of film.  It goes beyond the bubble gum styled visual spectacle that has a weak plot and mediocre acting.  Sucker Punch is basically an ego trip for a writer who thought it would be great fun to shoot scenes of giant robots fighting Germans in WWI trenches.... or maybe it is mental masturbation when you scribble together a few weak sauce lines and try to call it a story.  I did not even think the visuals were that good and I have a top of the line 65"" Plasma TV to watch on, so I should know what looks good.All in all this is a terrible movie.  I literally watched this disc (which I purchased here), struggled through to the end (by 20 minutes into the movie I was already debating turning it off) and promptly put it up for auction on eBay because I have absolutely zero desire to see this cornball piece of crap ever ever again.  I think at points during the movie I literally felt myself getting stupider.

1401054,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B004EPYZU8,judy,"[4, 11]","Yuck what a piece of mess this film was man did i hate this film it was completely the exact oposite of what i thought this film would be. This film is just bad. One of those trashy films that directors think will make money so they put it in a good month instead of January or September where this film should have been. This is on my Worst Films Of 2011 list by far it is probably in my top ten now it is just yuck. How could a Director with a good acting and visuals mess this film up? Well i'll tell you starting with the good to bad. With the two things listed above being the only good things that kept this film from completely taking number 1 as the years crapiest film of the year. Ok so the two good things include the acting, and the visuals. Ok so the acting was really decent but the actors just looked to pretty as action stars there acting was excellent but as said before its not convincing if you look like a model. The only actress that gains both points for her acting and looks is... The Rising Star Jena Malone. She looks just like an action star and she acts perfect while acouple others to note are Emily Browning and Abbie Cornish while neither look totally action star worthy ( Emily Browning the main problem in looks but great in acting) they act excellent, Emily Browningthe better of all of them she just does not look the part , she did try her best but she is just to sexy and hot. Some actress's including Jamie Chung are not given alot of screen time to act in the movie they are just not in the film enough for me to recomment them or highlight their acting sadly. And so we move on to our next and last good thing which is - The Visuals. Ok so the visuals are excellent probably the reason why the film got a Solid March release date instead of an end of January release date. I mean the visuals look fantastic, they are probably the main use of the budget actually. The visuals are not ground breacking but they do look magnificent and the 3D shots with the visual effects is pretty neat too. The visuals were well detailed as well with the creatures looking realistic in a cool and slightly desturbing way. Now on to the bad stuff people which include the script, the cast(i already talked about this so i will not say anything for it) the title (a rare catagory) the run time, the release date, the poster (also a rare catagory), the parts that are not action scenes, the director , and its sexist. Ok the script is by far one of the worst things to be included in this film, i mean the lines are stupid and one liner alot of times i mean god why did you give us this dreadful film that has little action scenes and takes place in a mental hospital a where women dance almost naked for men then the men pay for them and do it with themoh and girls are raped often. Yes that is the script and the action scenes take place when she is dancing for men Oh My God this films script sounds pretty stupid and dull to me and yes this film has alot of Sexist and Rape i hope you decide to skip the movie now its a waist of time which could be sent living and watching a good movie like The Hobbit which was amazing and actually good. Yuck !!! The Title for this film is just something horrible, thats why i decided to say something about it. I mean Sucker Punch wow its just stupid and has nothing to do with the film itself its just bad yuck i could have thought of a better title even my dog could have i swear!!! The run time for this film just dragges on and on i just can't handle it ,it is just way to long i now of some scenes that could have been cut to save time, alot of scenes actually to get the film to 1 hour and 20 minutes which i rarly support actually i usually critisise a film for being to short never for a film being to long but this film is just so dull and gloomy that it makes me want it to be shortened and thats saying something. The release date of the film was bad to i mean March 25th a solid release date and month no way nop don't waste the date on thi \s crap, instead give it a late January opening where i'm shere it will make decent money against a mostly weak month yet still stay away from the good months which are for good movies not this. The Poster for this film was just such a lie most of this film does not have any action yet the film is being marketed as the next expendables movie. Come on who are these players playing this is just like the poster for Bednobbs and Broomsticks where they advertised the film as almost all animated scenes yet the film features about 10 minutes of animated scenes at the end of the over long three hour film come on, the best scenes were the animated scenes any way so wow. All the parts in the film that take place in the mental house place are dull, boring, and the worst thing yet i pray for the awesome 20 minutes of action that takes place all throughout the film man this film is just so boring. I never liked Zack Snyder at all he is just a horrible excuss for a director and it just so happens he also wrote this films script which i hated as well his films are just made to make money and are as boring as can be i swear !!!! And this film besides Mulan and anoher film whcih title i forgot was sexist. Men abuse the women in this film attempt to rape, and hit women and shot them and do any horrible thing they can think of to the women in the mental house it just is not right.

Honestly I have no idea other than it was super cheap on a Black Friday and sale and boy am I glad that I got the extended version as it makes the movie so much better!The bluray quality is amazing during the fight scenes. The picture quality is very clear to see in the first fight scene alone. The blend of the cool, dreary winter exterior scenes mixed with the warm interior firelight (and fiery explosions!) is stark and captivating. The action pops off the screen and really draws your eye to all the subtle details you'd normally dismiss or ignore like the wooden support beams splintering with the bullet impacts of the sinister red glow of the samurai eyes. The fire effects look so real you'd almost think they literally blew up a building instead of the heavy green screening they used. That's just one example.The sound is so much beefier on the bluray I sometimes wonder if I even watched the same movie in the theater. The extended song and dance number with Carla Gugino & Oscar Isaac is so well done I found myself wishing they'd have left it in for the theatrical version. And I'm very much NOT a musical person, but there was no way you can sit and listen to that number and not be sucked into it. Along with the added visuals, which they stupidly omitted to keep the run time in check, the viewer misses out on a lot.If you have any interest in this movie at all, pick up this extended version. It's down to a good price now and well worth the money.

Sorry, but it was WEIRD.The CGI was FANTASTIC, a definite 5 plus.  The music was pretty hip.  It was kickin' at another 5, assuming you like heavy-beat rock with some rap.  It made me feel like dancing myself!  The story was a ZERO -- nada, zilch, zippo.  Don't get me wrong though, I could easily watch it again for the CGI.The movie begins with a young girl (age 18 or so?) and her sister (age 8?).  Their mother dies and they are left all the inheritance while their step-father gets nothing.  Boy, is he mad!  He comes after the oldest girl, obviously attempting to do her harm.  She escapes and comes back with a gun, too late to save her now dead sister.  With the blood on her hands from caressing her sister, she shoots the gun but does not kill daddy.  Daddy calls the authorities and says the girl did it.  Next thing you know, the girl is in the Lennox House for the criminally insane in Vermont.  (This all happens in the very beginning.) Daddy does some wheeling and dealing with an orderly there to make sure the girl never gets to talk about it, but the girl decides she is going to get out and enlists the help of others she is in there with.  (From here, most of us would probably expect certain things to happen and have already formulated the expected ending in our minds.--Guess what?  Nope!) From here, she goes off into several scenarios of fantasy fighting her inner demons with the help of her friends.  The scenarios are different and jump all around.I don't want to tell you anymore about the plot.  I will admit that I stayed with the movie the whole time and was very interested, but I am fascinated by great CGI, so the CGI with the thumpin' heavy-beat music was enough for me.In generalizing, I would say this is a movie mostly for the younger folks (age 18 - 38 or so, and 38 may be on the high side).  Most people 40 or over would probably give it a negative rating.  If you are on the fence about it, I suggest you rent it for a buck from the big red box before you buy it.",3,Great CGI.

Loria,"[4, 8]","There a many reasons I was (and remain) excited for the release of Suckerpunch:1) An original concept by the director of such Graphic Novel adaptations as 300, Watchmen and the Upcoming Man of Steel Superman reboot project, too.2.) I'm always ready for Retro-Neo-Anime-kick-a$$-Chicks, including the lovely  Emily Browning as an institutionalized girl slated for a lobotomy who escapes to a reality as Babydoll along with 4 equally hot inmates the brash Rocket (Jena Malone), the street-wise Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), the loyal Amber (Jamie Chung) and dear-reluctant Sweet-Pea (Abbie Cornish) as fact and fiction merge.3.)Suckerpunch is the first mainstream DieselPunk movie since 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,' or 'Dark City' although it is not a pure example of the sub-genre as there's modern firearms and fantasy aspects present which diverges from traditional Dieselpunk. If you aren't familiar with the genre DieselPunk it's a term coined by  by game designer Lewis, to include a WW II  look along with stylistic influences of that period like Art Deco, pulp serial film cliffhangers , film noir, even  pinups.Ultimately Suckerpunch's premise of removing us and characters from the 'real'  world provides ammo for over-the-top action, but at the cost of creating cliched characters. While one can make an argument for the archetypes and roles assumed here, it can also be argued it can be too formulaic. The film's action scenes are epic, no question, but opportunities are missed to develop them. In the end a needed narrator closes the gaps in on-screen exposition with what can also be construed as a stylistic element and not a flaw incharacter development or storytelling.The story is largely akin to Alice in Wonderland meets the Anime feature of your choice.,, our incarcerated heroines band together to escape the hands of Blue (Oscar Isaac), Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) and the High Roller (Jon Hamm) by collecting 5 symbolic items,  a map, fire, a knife,  a key and a mystery all while building their own sense of self-worth, of course.Having grown up with the Star Wars saga, the storytelling aspects of film scoring is a very important consideration for me; here Suckerpunch is a knockout (sorry). The soundtrack merges nicely with it's visuals, single songs framing scenes using clever covers, mash-ups and remixes from Queen, Bjork, The Pixies, The Beatles, Jefferson Airplane, Iggy Pop.

1401064,A1NJAHBDRV1I94,B004EPYZU8,KG Truth=Freedom,"[6, 11]","Sucker Punch is a grand slam, 5-star, diamond studded allegorical tale of the triumph of the human spirit over the dark forces of misogyny, malevolence and grindingly wicked evil. Come-on, we've all encountered these ""gutter rat characters,"" in real life, albeit for most of us in lesser form. Don't you want to see the pimp, schoolyard bully, morally corrupt politician, obnoxiously controlling boss, or rapaciously greedy Wall Street Financier get obliterated? Sure you do! These and other societal miscreants imprison, manipulate and control for their own selfish purposes. And, I'm sure you can conjure up other communal deviants; they are all represented in this movie by the step-father and certain staff members at the insane asylum who are then cast in the metaphoric form of the zombie storm troopers, orcs and mindless robots in Babydoll's dreams where she and her companions destroy them: Domina  Victoria!  And here Babydoll, empowered by her dreams (remember, dreams are all that she has - she's locked up in an insane asylum awaiting a lobotomy) finds her true inner strength and saves herself and her other companions,  if only in self- redemption, while Sweat Pea is literally saved. Good triumphs over evil while Love triumphs over lechery, avarice and the objectification of the powerless female, or any human being enslaved by undeserved, ill-fated circumstances. In this movie, the innocent victims empower themselves and ultimately triumph -- a noble theme in a mostly ignoble world today. It is truly inspiring, especially if you've ever been figuratively ""sucker-punched"". Assuming we all have (been sucker-punched) this movie becomes universally relevant. And, the music fits like a cashmere glove on this unfolding allegorical tale as it completely envelopes and immerses  you into the story. Haven't you ever fallen into a metaphorical rabbit hole ... like Alice in Wonderland or, as in the movie, Babydoll entering the insane asylum? Been in a place where all is not apparent and much is hidden?  Been the victim of, for example, a destructive and manipulating malignant narcissist?  Well, in this movie they are all destroyed. Vaporized! Finally, simpler, better lines could not have been written for a movie ... they are captivating, especially those at the end and also from the character played by Scott Glenn. The director skillfully unfolds this well written and produced allegorical masterpiece through the rhetorical device of metaphor and in doing so achieves a work of Genius!  Go ""through the looking glass"" again. See it a 2nd time with some intellectual flare, fired-up imagination and eyes wide open.",5,"5 Star, Diamond Studded, Allegorical Masterpiece",1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,2641,"['Sucker', 'Punch', 'grand', 'slam', '5-star', 'diamond', 'studded', 'allegorical', 'tale', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'dark', 'forces', 'misogyny', 'malevolence', 'grindingly', 'wicked', 'evil', 'Come-on', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'gutter', 'rat', 'characters', 'real', 'life', 'most', 'lesser', 'form', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'pimp', 'schoolyard', 'bully', 'morally', 'corrupt', 'politician', 'obnoxiously', 'controlling', 'boss', 'rapaciously', 'greedy', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Financier', 'get', 'obliterated', 'Sure', 'do', 'other', 'societal', 'miscreants', 'imprison', 'manipulate', 'control', 'own', 'selfish', 'purposes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'conjure', 'up', 'other', 'communal', 'deviants', 'are', 'represented', 'movie', 'step-father', 'certain', 'staff', 'members', 'insane', 'asylum', 'who', 'are', 'then', 'cast', 'metaphoric', 'form', 'zombie', 'storm', 'troopers', 'orcs', 'mindless', 'robots', 'Babydoll', 'dreams', 'where', 'companions', 'destroy', 'Domina', 'Victoria', 'here', 'Babydoll', 'empowered', 'dreams', 'remember', 'dreams', 'are', 'locked', 'up', 'insane', 'asylum', 'awaiting', 'lobotomy', 'true', 'inner', 'strength', 'other', 'companions', 'only', 'self-', 'redemption', 'Sweat', 'Pea', 'literally', 'saved', 'Good', 'triumphs', 'evil', 'Love', 'triumphs', 'lechery', 'avarice', 'objectification', 'powerless', 'female', 'human', 'being', 'enslaved', 'undeserved', 'ill-fated', 'circumstances', 'movie', 'innocent', 'victims', 'empower', 'ultimately', 'triumph', 'noble', 'theme', 'mostly', 'ignoble', 'world', 'today', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'figuratively', 'sucker-punched', 'Assuming', 'have', 'been', 'sucker-punched', 'movie', 'universally', 'relevant', 'music', 'cashmere', 'glove', 'unfolding', 'allegorical', 'tale', 'completely', 'story', 'Have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'fallen', 'metaphorical', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'movie', 'Babydoll', 'entering', 'insane', 'asylum', 'Been', 'place', 'where', 'not', 'apparent', 'much', 'hidden', 'victim', 'example', 'destructive', 'manipulating', 'malignant', 'narcissist', 'Well', 'movie', 'are', 'destroyed', 'Vaporized', 'Finally', 'simpler', 'better', 'lines', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'movie', 'are', 'captivating', 'especially', 'end', 'also', 'character', 'played', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'director', 'skillfully', 'well', 'written', 'produced', 'allegorical', 'masterpiece', 'rhetorical', 'device', 'metaphor', 'doing', 'so', 'work', 'Genius', 'Go', 'looking', 'glass', 'again', 'See', '2nd', 'time', 'intellectual', 'flare', 'fired-up', 'imagination', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open']",Sucker Punch

'Sucker Punch' is a perfect example of a good concept that was ALL show and an ambiguous lack luster storyline.  It tried the ""dream within a dream"" motif that worked so well for 'Inception' and instead of drawing audiences into it's fantasy world, it fell FLAT.  The storyline was mediocre at best and tried to wow audiences with it's photoshop filters, special effects, & soundtrack.  I felt like I was trapped inside a psychedelic video game the entire movie and was wondering what drugs Zack was on when he wrote this movie.  And the Yoda like message at the end was laughable at best after viewing that mess.  The message I took was, ""There is freedom in your own delusions.""  Which is exactly what many who are fans of this genre do to escape the reality of their own lives.  This was by far the most disappointing movie I've seen in the last 2 years and I felt 'Sucker Punched' atter paying to see it.  I actually felt sorry for the actresses who did a great job with their performances.  I'm frightened to think what Zack Snyder is going to do with the Superman franchise after seeing this train wreck. And does anyone actually think an extended cut of this film is going to be any better?

1401066,ALNRF3NGCQ0IK,B004EPYZU8,$ko7,"[4, 16]","I watched this movie on opening day and boy did I feel ripped off... I've also read allot of reviews over the months and wanted to try and convey exactly what is really going on with this film to help others make a logical choice weather to buy the ticket and take the ride.Honestly, I really wanted to like it :(People who review the film throw words and phrases around like ""misguided"" or ""misunderstood""... I'd agree, things like using Sweet Dreams in the opening sequence was terribly misguided by the director and set's an odd tone right from the word go in my opinion.This movie is supposed to be a story about empowerment, which is admirable. The two biggest flaws in it seem to be as follows. The trailer leads you to believe it's going to have allot of sexy girls in short skirts leaping around fighting crazy robots and monsters with swords and machine guns. Which it does have, however this accounts for less then half the film... about 40-50 minutes on the generous side, broken into 4 sequences through out the film.The majority of the film is more like Little Orphan Anne meets Moulin Rouge, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What is bad however is in order to get a PG-13 rating allot of this portion of the film had scenes of a mature nature cut or trimmed way down. This kills allot of momentum of the film, but most importantly it removes the feeling of danger and pearl we should feel for all the main characters. At first I felt it was because the story is ""a dream, within' a dream"", but have since realized it's because it's PG-13. There's a cap on what we will see as an audience which brings the level of engagement way down. Nothing on screen will be as terrible as what we can imagine in the same situation. When a scene comes that leads us to believe something unsavory is about to happen, we automatically know it won't be that bad, due to the rating... something will intervene to keep us safe at PG13.  Together these two elements really hurt the film because we, as an audience quickly realize two things. First, due to it being a dream, the characters are never really in true pearl and secondly that in situations where the characters are in a position to have unthinkable physical harm befall them, on or off screen it's never as terrible because it's a PG-13 dream... honestly, it would have been better if it was exactly the same movie but with an R rating so the viewer isn't preconditioned by the rating to understand how far things will actually go.I was hoping the dvd/blueray would have the additional material put back in to see if the film plays out any better, but if the run time is accurate on this listing that doesn't appear so. I think ultimately, the concept wasn't bad and was even an admirable attempt, the special effects and fight scenes are spectacular and worth a look. I just found myself not caring about any of the characters and just wishing the movie was over about 25 minutes in so I could do something more constructive with my afternoon.",2,Not Exactly What Is Advertised.,1308096000,"06 15, 2011",2011,3004,"['watched', 'movie', 'opening', 'day', 'boy', 'did', 'feel', 'ripped', ""'ve"", 'also', 'read', 'allot', 'reviews', 'months', 'wanted', 'try', 'convey', 'exactly', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'film', 'help', 'others', 'make', 'logical', 'choice', 'weather', 'buy', 'ticket', 'take', 'ride.Honestly', 'really', 'wanted', 'People', 'who', 'review', 'film', 'throw', 'words', 'misguided', 'misunderstood', ""'d"", 'agree', 'things', 'using', 'Sweet', 'Dreams', 'opening', 'sequence', 'was', 'terribly', 'misguided', 'director', 'set', 'odd', 'tone', 'right', 'word', 'go', 'opinion.This', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'story', 'empowerment', 'admirable', 'two', 'biggest', 'flaws', 'seem', 'be', 'trailer', 'believe', 'going', 'have', 'allot', 'sexy', 'girls', 'short', 'skirts', 'leaping', 'fighting', 'crazy', 'robots', 'monsters', 'swords', 'machine', 'guns', 'have', 'however', 'accounts', 'less', 'then', 'film', '40-50', 'minutes', 'generous', 'side', 'broken', '4', 'sequences', 'film.The', 'majority', 'film', 'more', 'like', 'Little', 'Orphan', 'Anne', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'What', 'bad', 'however', 'order', 'get', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'allot', 'portion', 'film', 'had', 'scenes', 'mature', 'nature', 'cut', 'trimmed', 'way', 'down', 'allot', 'momentum', 'film', 'most', 'importantly', 'feeling', 'danger', 'pearl', 'should', 'feel', 'main', 'characters', 'first', 'felt', 'was', 'story', 'dream', 'dream', 'have', 'realized', 'PG-13', 'cap', 'what', 'will', 'see', 'audience', 'level', 'engagement', 'way', 'down', 'Nothing', 'screen', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'terrible', 'what', 'can', 'imagine', 'same', 'situation', 'When', 'scene', 'believe', 'something', 'unsavory', 'happen', 'automatically', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'due', 'rating', 'something', 'will', 'intervene', 'keep', 'safe', 'PG13', 'Together', 'two', 'elements', 'really', 'hurt', 'film', 'audience', 'quickly', 'realize', 'two', 'things', 'First', 'due', 'being', 'dream', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'true', 'pearl', 'secondly', 'situations', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'position', 'have', 'unthinkable', 'physical', 'harm', 'befall', 'screen', 'never', 'as', 'terrible', 'PG-13', 'dream', 'honestly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'exactly', 'same', 'movie', 'R', 'rating', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'preconditioned', 'rating', 'understand', 'how', 'far', 'things', 'will', 'actually', 'go.I', 'was', 'hoping', 'dvd/blueray', 'would', 'have', 'additional', 'material', 'put', 'back', 'see', 'film', 'out', 'better', 'run', 'time', 'accurate', 'listing', ""n't"", 'appear', 'so', 'think', 'ultimately', 'concept', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', 'even', 'admirable', 'attempt', 'special', 'effects', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'spectacular', 'look', 'just', 'found', 'not', 'caring', 'characters', 'just', 'wishing', 'movie', 'was', '25', 'minutes', 'so', 'could', 'do', 'something', 'more', 'constructive', 'afternoon']",Sucker Punch

A young girl's dream world provides the ultimate escape from her darker reality. Unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place, she is free to go where her mind takes her, and her incredible adventures blur the lines between what's real and what is imaginary. She has been locked away against her will, but Babydoll has not lost her will to survive. Determined to fight for her freedom, she urges four other young girls--the outspoken Rocket, the street-smart Blondie, the fiercely loyal Amber and the reluctant Sweet Pea - to band together and try to escape their terrible fate at the hands of their captors, Blue, Madam Gorski and the High Roller. Led by Babydoll, the girls engage in fantastical warfare against everything from samurais to serpents, with a virtual arsenal at their disposal. Together, they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice in order to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man, their unbelievable journey - if they succeed - will set them free.The cast led by Emily Browning (as Babydoll), Abbie Cornish (as Sweet Pea), Jena Malone (as Rocket), Vanessa Hudgens (as Blondie), Jamie Chung (as Amber), Carla Gugino (as Dr. Vera Gorski), Oscar Issac (as Blue), Jon Hamm (as High Roller / Doctor) & Scott Glenn (as Wise Man) is great.

Swanson,"[0, 0]","It's nice eye candy, especially if you like watching hundreds of people shot at close range in eye-popping color and all sorts of sordid near-rapes and so on, but in the end the acting and script are too hare-brained and harshly violent for this to be much fun.It's kind of a women-take-revenge-on-evil-men-flick, and there are some gorgeous CGI effects, but halfway through I was already ready for it to end. After a while it felt like the whole thing was just a set-up for selling the accompanying video game. It's a comic book, true, but even then one wants characters with more than comic book depth to them.And when the incredible effects almost always end up in brutal violence, it gets old and wearing pretty fast.

Baby Doll, the main character, and her svelte companions are on a quest for freedom.  Simple enough.  Just go with it.  Let the CG fantasy worlds wash over you.  Rock and roll to the rattle of machine gun fire.  Watch Baby Doll get busy with her samurai sword and stainless steel handgun.  Enjoy the gorgeous faces (and figures) of Jamie Chung and Vanessa Hudgens.  Again, just go with it.  Don't analyze it to death.  Towering samurai warriors, steampunk zombie soldiers, orcs, and terminator-type robots... all getting whacked by a contingency of young commando babes.  There's a lot of visual goodness here.  If you paid for and then disliked this movie, you didn't do your homework.  If you think Fight Club or American Beauty are ""important"" films then something like Sucker Punch may be a bit too straightforward for you.  To the director's credit, Sucker Punch never becomes preachy (like Avatar), and it doesn't pretend to be more than what it is (like the overblown Matrix Trilogy).  The plot rambles much less than the second Transformers film (Revenge of the Fallen) and you'll care more about the main characters, especially Rocket who befriends Baby Doll and then deliberately makes the ultimate sacrifice.  If you liked Underworld Evolution or The Crow you'll probably like Sucker Punch.The movie gives you exactly what you should expect in abundance: entertainment with rich visuals, highly-stylized characters, and thumpin' beats.  The film is a mixture of A Series of Unfortunate Events (unwanted orphans with inheritance), Inception (dream sequences), Resident Evil Afterlife (machine guns, zombies, sword play), and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (with Baby Doll being Randle McMurphy and Sweet Pea as Chief Bromden).  Or you could simply remake the Shawshank Redemption with battle mecha and Mila Kunis in lingerie with the fighting skills of Jet Li.  Then add one big dragon, a snazzy bad guy named Blue, a statuesque Polish psychotherapist, and a brooding Gotham City atmosphere.  Many reviews mention the sexual aspects of the film.  Except for the skimpy outfits and moderate innuendo, the movie is not overtly sexual.  There is an element of fan service, but no nudity or even a love scene.  There is only one kiss in the movie and it's stolen.  The theatrical cut is rated PG-13.  Many rap and pop music videos are considerably more tawdry than this movie.  I also find it odd that a few negative reviews call the movie ""pornographic"" without also mentioning the really disturbing bits: a little girl (Baby Doll's sister) is killed by her greedy sadistic stepfather, and later in the film two young women are shot to death at point-blank range in cold blood (no graphic details are shown, but it's still very disturbing).",4,It's like Megan Fox in Alcatraz with Sigmund Freud and a Glock 357,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,2885,"['Abused', 'exploited', 'falsely-imprisoned', 'girls', 'are', 'looking', 'way', 'Lennox', 'House', 'insane', 'asylum', 'lovely', 'Brattleboro', 'Vermont', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'main', 'character', 'svelte', 'companions', 'are', 'quest', 'freedom', 'Simple', 'enough', 'Just', 'go', 'Let', 'CG', 'fantasy', 'worlds', 'wash', 'Rock', 'roll', 'rattle', 'machine', 'gun', 'fire', 'Watch', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'get', 'busy', 'samurai', 'sword', 'stainless', 'steel', 'handgun', 'Enjoy', 'gorgeous', 'figures', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'Again', 'just', 'go', 'Do', ""n't"", 'analyze', 'death', 'Towering', 'samurai', 'warriors', 'steampunk', 'zombie', 'soldiers', 'orcs', 'terminator-type', 'robots', 'getting', 'whacked', 'contingency', 'young', 'commando', 'babes', 'lot', 'visual', 'goodness', 'here', 'paid', 'then', 'disliked', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'homework', 'think', 'Fight', 'Club', 'American', 'Beauty', 'are', 'important', 'films', 'then', 'something', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'straightforward', 'director', 'credit', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'never', 'preachy', 'Avatar', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'more', 'what', 'overblown', 'Matrix', 'Trilogy', 'plot', 'much', 'less', 'second', 'Transformers', 'film', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', ""'ll"", 'care', 'more', 'main', 'characters', 'especially', 'Rocket', 'who', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'then', 'deliberately', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'liked', 'Underworld', 'Evolution', 'Crow', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'Sucker', 'Punch.The', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'should', 'expect', 'abundance', 'entertainment', 'rich', 'visuals', 'highly-stylized', 'characters', 'thumpin', 'beats', 'film', 'mixture', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'unwanted', 'orphans', 'inheritance', 'Inception', 'dream', 'sequences', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Afterlife', 'machine', 'guns', 'zombies', 'sword', 'play', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'being', 'Randle', 'McMurphy', 'Sweet', 'Pea', 'Chief', 'Bromden', 'could', 'simply', 'remake', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'battle', 'mecha', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'lingerie', 'fighting', 'skills', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Then', 'add', 'one', 'big', 'dragon', 'snazzy', 'bad', 'guy', 'named', 'Blue', 'statuesque', 'Polish', 'psychotherapist', 'brooding', 'Gotham', 'City', 'atmosphere', 'Many', 'reviews', 'mention', 'sexual', 'aspects', 'film', 'skimpy', 'outfits', 'moderate', 'innuendo', 'movie', 'not', 'overtly', 'sexual', 'element', 'fan', 'service', 'nudity', 'even', 'love', 'scene', 'only', 'one', 'kiss', 'movie', 'stolen', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'Many', 'rap', 'pop', 'music', 'videos', 'are', 'considerably', 'more', 'tawdry', 'movie', 'also', 'find', 'few', 'negative', 'reviews', 'call', 'movie', 'pornographic', 'also', 'mentioning', 'really', 'disturbing', 'bits', 'little', 'girl', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'sister', 'killed', 'greedy', 'sadistic', 'stepfather', 'later', 'film', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'shot', 'death', 'point-blank', 'range', 'cold', 'blood', 'graphic', 'details', 'are', 'shown', 'still', 'very', 'disturbing']",Sucker Punch

1401084,A1R17YELPTSM5T,B004EPYZU8,MacJunegrand,"[3, 4]","Zack Snyder has gained notoriety for his extremely visually-appealing films.  If there's something you can't say about his movies is that they don't look pretty.  When Sucker Punch was being marketed, people wowed at the looks of the movie, but they were mostly at odds at what to think at what little they knew about the film's plot.  Some people didn't care, because they knew they'd at least be entertained, while others pointed out that Snyder's most famous and best films have been adaptations, while this story was wholly original, and they didn't trust Snyder had what it takes to write a compelling story.When the movie was released it was inmediately panned by most critics and audiences.  I admit that was the reason I didn't go see this film in theaters.  Heck, even after I purchased the Blu Ray I let it sit there for weeks until I got the courage to watch it.  Everyone complained about the fantastic visuals being wasted in a poor story with bad characters.  On the one hand, it gave me hope, since it would mean people would finally be taking into account good stories in their films instead of just the visuals.  On the other hand, it gave me pause, since except for this particular event, people kept and still keep proving to this day that movies with terrible stories and awful characters are still successful, even with visuals much weaker than the ones in this film, or even terrible (for instance, the Twilight series).What happened then?  Why is that movies with worse elements had been less despised, or even loved?  Sometimes you can suffer from very bad marketing (like Green Lantern did), sometimes you'll have people believing so hard a movie will fail that they'll be conditioned to dislike it even after watching it (like happened to The A-Team).  And sometimes... sometimes a movie will simply be terribly misunderstood.  This is, I believe, what happened to Sucker Punch.I got this movie's Blu Ray on a whim, and I have to say, I don't regret having purchased it, and I do regret not having seen it on a theater.  The visuals are fantastic, period.  You know that, going to a Zack Snyder movie.  The story, though, can be confusing to the point of people not believing there's actually one.  Reading a bunch of reviews, I can see were the reviewers are coming from, but it looks like they didn't consider a movie that looked this good could have a good story and they didn't really bother to look for it.  On the other hand, I only saw the extended cut, and maybe the theatrical cut is harder to understand.  In any case, there's absolutely no doubt that lots of people failed to understand it, for one reason or another.Emily Browning plays the protagonist, a girl whose mother died and left her and her sister everything in her will.  Her stepfather, mad at that fact, decides to kill the daughters, starting with the younger one.  Emily's character escapes, gets hold of the stepfather's gun, wounds him but accidentally kills her sister (this part is ambiguous, the sister might be dead before she arrives, but there's no question she blames herself for her sister's death).  The stepfather takes this as an opportunity and interns her in an asylum, claiming she went insane and secretly paying a shady employee to get her a lobotomy.  Five days later, as the procedure is about to start, we get to see the story of those five days unfold as a fantasy inside her head.  That story involves her plan to escape the brothel with a bunch of other girls she befriends.Yes, a brothel.  As it happens, those five days are set in a brother instead of the asylum.  Why?  Well, you see, it's heavily implied (make no mistake, this movie's story doesn't hold your hand, that's one of the main reasons so many people misunderstood it) that the girls in the asylum are victims of rape.  The brothel fantasy makes the protagonist put some sense into a situation that's already happening without the girls' consent.  She knows they're having sex with strangers, but in her fantasy, they're not being forced, they're choosing to do it.  Also, the fantasy replaces her lobotomy with the loss of her virginity.  As an aside, she and her friends go by codenames, like Rocket, Blondie or Sweet Pea.  The protagonist goes by Baby Doll.After saving a girl from a tragedy, Baby Doll befriends her and her pals and devises a plan to escape, thanks to the one element of the movie that can be attributed to supernatural forces instead of mere fantasy: a guardian angel, an instructor, a wise man.  The plan involves getting a bunch of items from the asylum/brothel, which are stolen by her friends while she distracts the staff by dancing.  You see, Baby Doll can dance so wonderfully she mesmerizes everyone who watches.  Now, people who watch this and take it literally might (and will) scoff at the concept, but you have to realize that, leving aside the fact that this is a fantasy, the rating (PG-13) won't allow them to mention what's REALLY happening.  ""Dancing"" is code for, depending who you ask, either ""stripping"" or ""having sex"".  This is a brothel, of course it wouldn't make any sense to have a girl dancing fully clothed and that somehow being so good to distract everyone around.  Then again, since the entire five-days wait is for her to ""lose her virginity"" I'd say sex is out the question in the fantasy brothel.  I believe the easiest way to explain what happens is this: in the real world (asylum) she's having sex to distract people while her friends steal the items, while in the fantasy world (brothel) she's either stripping or masturbating (or both) while her friends steal the items, but this is called ""dancing"" for the purposes of keeping the PG-13 rating.In any case, you'd realize that neither of those would be a good fantasy for her to have while the stealing happens, so she replaces that with a Inception-style fantasy within a fantasy.  Every time she has to ""dance"" her mind switches to an alternate steampunk world where she and her friends are a group of sword-wielding gun-totting monster-bashing fighters on a mission to obtain an item that's a representation of whatever item in the real world they're out to obtain.  The best action of the film happens on these sequences, which are visually stunning and stylistic.  Every time the sequence ends and they obtain the item, we go back to the brothel, where Baby Doll stops ""dancing"" while her friends have the real item in their hands.So, as you can see, the film borrows heavily from a couple of known movies, such as The Matrix, Inception or Shutter Island.  The problem with the back-and-fort between fantasies is that it probably confuses some people who are not used to movies not telling them exactly what's going on.  I have to say, you might have to watch it more than once to get what's really happening.  I don't think it will be necessary, since I only saw it once and understood it perfectly, but you can clearly see by reading the reviews of the theatrical release that A LOT of people didn't understand it.I will concede a couple of points for the early reviews, though.  Despite this supposedly being a fantasy inside a girl's head, visually it's definitely a male fantasy.  Hot girls in skimpy outfits, doing cool, stylized moves with swords and guns while doing sexy poses is not something most girls would fantasize about.  And, of course, the story isn't very original (as I said, it borrows heavily from other films).  So, it's Sucker Punch a female-empowerment tale?  Not really.  Is it demeaning to girls, then?  No, not that either.  Is it all style and no substance?  No, the substance is there, but sometimes the style will distract you from seeing it.  Is it a bad film?  No.  It's not a fantastic film either, but it's definitely a good one.",4,Misunderstood little gem,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,7771,"['Zack', 'Snyder', 'gained', 'notoriety', 'extremely',

I suppose this is not the first time I have judged a book by its cover and decided something was awful before every really giving it a chance.  And it is not the first time that I have been completely wrong.  I LOVED this movie.  First off, and without question, it is visually stunning.  Zack Snyder sure can paint a pretty picture.  I thought the CGI was perfect and the atmosphere totally pulled me in.  If you like steampunk you will certainly enjoy this movie.  Secondly, being an action fan, I was not at all disappointed with that aspect.  I guess the easy way to describe the action is by simply saying that it is COOL. Someone described this movie to me as one long music video.  That is somewhat an accurate description.  And the soundtrack is great.  Guess I don't understand all the hate that this movie has received.  Will it win any Oscars? Definitely not for the acting or the script, though those are not at all what I would call weak.  Everyone involved does a good job.  Perhaps most of the critics were like me and judged this movie based on the trailer without actually watching it.  I suggest watching it from start to finish before making any final decisions.  I think it is better than 300, which i felt was overrated anyway.  Just my opinion.  And as we all know, critics are often wrong and who really cares if it wins any awards?  I can think of numerous Oscar-winning and critically acclaimed films that, for lack of a better term, sucked.  And I can think of many films that were panned by mainstream critics and are excellent.  So if you watch this movie in its entirity and still feel its terrible then that is your call.

1401088,A129YBX5BVNW2,B004EPYZU8,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 1]","""Sucker Punch"" gets so close - it really does. For about 50% of its duration - it absolutely rocks. Employing visuals that borrow heavily from Guillermo Del Toro's ""Hellboy"" and The Wachowski Brothers' ""Matrix"" (falling empty shell casings, running up and down walls with big guns and even bigger swords) - it serves up huge action set pieces that come at you with the breathtaking audacity of a Punk band doing their first gig. But I'm afraid that's where the good news end, because there is also so much 'wrong' with this film...The story goes something like this - the principal female character (the permanently soppy-faced Baby Doll played by Emily Browning) has five days to escape before the 'High Roller' comes into town and has his perverted way. Baby Doll and her fellow inmates are then instructed by a wise warrior (Scott Glenn) to gather up 5 items from 4 battles - a map, a knife, fire and a Key - the fifth item being an unknown - a mythical thing that will set them free if only Baby Doll can recognize what it is. It helps of course that the heroines look like a SEAL team from St. Trinians - tooled-up twenty-something nubiles with protruding cleavage, laced-up leather bodices, frilly skirts and Cheerleader ponytails.It all sounds like great fun - and as I say - in parts it is. But all that hard-won admiration goes right out the window when we encounter the real world and the 'other' storyline...The girls are really in a Vermont Sanatorium - orphaned and under the watchful eye of a violent slimeball called Blue (Oscar Isaac). The Lennox House for the Mentally Insane is a place where cruelty is an institutionalized norm and use of their bodies a lucrative side business. To alleviate all of this authority-ignored abuse of the inmates, Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino) teaches each pretty young lady how to dance and thereby 'escape' to where there is no fear and they are free. ""...That place can be as real as any pain..."" she wisely councils them - poncing about the theatre area in her own ludicrously provocative outfit that's a composite of teacher, Madam and slut. And as you can imagine - it's these slyly staged scenes that will sorely test the patience of even the most open-minded of viewers. I hate to come across like an old prude here - but the 'girlpower' theme is so obviously exploitive - and worse - the film is blatantly guilty of voyeuristic sleaze it supposedly abhors.But that's not the worst part - there's sickening cruelty doled out by men on the girls. Instead of empowerment of women we get assaults in kitchens, beatings in offices and lap dancing for grotesque male patrons. And ""Sucker Punch"" somehow seems to gloat on it too. It smacks of appalling hypocrisy and has of course caused an outcry in the States (as did the graphic violence to children in the sick ""Watchmen""). Women's Groups everywhere may quite rightly feel that Director Zack Snyder needs to be taken outside - given a good slap - and told to grow up.It's a damn shame because you can't help but think that with some obvious rejiggering of the plot - put all the fantasy action sequences together in one go with the Asylum stuff at the end - thereby giving you a big reveal and also giving the girls a freedom of sorts - Snyder might have indeed produced a genre masterpiece that actually said something into the bargain. The actresses themselves could also be accused of being 'suckered' into such an obvious mix of titillation and torture, but they were probably having too much fun swinging around on pulleys to notice.""Sucker Punch"" is not a movie I'm going to watch again willingly - let alone buy - and it's hard to forgive its staggeringly convenient theme about the empowerment of women through sexy clothes and fighting.

1401091,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B004EPYZU8,maskedgamer,"[1, 1]","The film has plenty of pretty girls, skimpy outfits, great action sequences and yet it doesn't have any substance to it. There's nothing to really connect it all so it just seems random and slapped together. Usually when a movie comes out like this people try to put some deeper meaning to it and run to the usual &#34;you just didn't get it&#34; statements. This is an action movie that didn't make any sense and has the dialogue of a Sunday newspaper comic strip. If it weren't for all the pretty girls wearing skimpy outfits I'd have probably looked for another movie to watch. I just wish this movie had more to it than really just being a series of adolescent day dreams. Maybe a spoiler here *The main character Babydoll gets lobotomized and the twist is that she willingly accepts it.* Probably to forget about her mother dying, her sister being killed, and her step father screwing her over by dumping her in a mental institution so he can claim the mothers estate and assets.Not a very happy movie and not one that makes itself very clear. In the real world the girls at the mental institution are being sexually abused by the character Blue. The story is about them trying to escape Blue and the institution. Zack Snyder has made some movies I loved like 300 and some movies I couldn't stand and highly hated like &#34;Watchmen&#34;. Sucker Punch just seemed like an expensive experiment.

What could possibly be bad about this movie?Other than, like, everything?This movie was abysmal. Watching someone play UNCHARTED is more interesting than this movie because at least that video game has interesting characters, a good plot and is coherent. Look, COULD this have been a good movie? Yes. But the storytelling is completely incomprehensible and when it's not, it's insipid.Zach Snyder does action brilliantly, but he is not a storyteller. Here, he even created the story, so it's doubly awful. Dark themes, a mental asylum, girls in danger and a prison escape are all great pieces - as is the idea of a girl creating her own world to escape from the horrors of her reality. But it needs to be cohesive. There is no connection between the real world, the imagined world, and the dreamworld.In the climax of THE MATRIX, we are concerned about what happens to our characters when they're in the Matrix because we know it will affect them in reality. We're also brought back and forth between those worlds to understand the consequences of actions and decisions made in each world. We see both sides. SUCKER PUNCH eschews these cinematic rules in favor of ten-minute video game fight levels that hold no suspense because it all happens in the main characters mind and no one can get hurt. If these sequences mirror what is happening in the real world, we either never see it or it's so poorly connected that all suspense disappears.Zack Snyder is not Christopher Nolan.

Bartelt ""buyer of stuff""","[2, 6]","Yes, you read my title and rating right.Sucker Punch is probably the most visually appealing bad movie ever made.I see where the director was trying to take the story.  I understand what he was trying to do.  He failed.  Miserably.  Beautifully.  The pretentious dialogue, which would have detracted from a really great movie, at the end was even the icing on the cake and was the final cringe before the credits rolled.Personally, the movie would have been much better if the girls had been wearing skimpier clothing.  They were far too covered up and in the end, detracted what could have been an interesting suspenseful T&A; movie.  It fails.Disjointed fantasies could have worked if they were tied together with some plot more than ""we need a map, fire, a key, a knife and some really good drugs so we can make it all work.""  Sadly, it doesn't.Baby Doll is such an amazing dancer, everyone sees her fantasy.  Except that we never see her dance.  Not even at the end.  Perhaps white girl can't really dance?  Who would have known.Unfortunately there is no extreme in this movie except for extreme CGI.  It could have been really good.  Unfortunately all it really becomes is a teenaged JO movie that was too afraid to go in any direction and holds itself back at every turn... that it had none.The beauty of the movie is lost from direction and scriptwriting that was too afraid to push it away from a PG-13 rating.  I never saw the theatrical cut and after watching the extended cut, I never want to.  All I know is that this movie tops the hall of shame and is ideal to present to friends when there is nothing better to watch and want to cringe on how beautiful a horrible movie really can be.I wish the director would have sat down and watched a few truly disturbing movies and decided to take it off the worn path.For what it's worth, Terry Gilliam's Tideland is one of my favorite movies.  At least Gilliam was able to push the movie in a direction that none other have gone and wasn't afraid to do it.  Sucker Punch could have been one of those movies that everyone will remember.

My biggest complaint on most chick-driven action flicks is how unconvincing the gun-shooting and fighting sequences are. But not the case in ""Sucker Punch"" These women are as proficient in their use of weapons and tactics as Navy ""S.e.a.l.s"" Totally convincing! You will never look at your girlfriend or wife the same way again. And if one word sums up Zack's movies, it's COOL. What makes Zack's films so much better than the average action flick is his use of a virtual 3-D camera environment which totally immerses you in the experience, unlike most film-makers who are linear in their action. Just as in ""Alien"" you are never not quite sure of what you're looking at until the camera completes it's roll, pitch and yaw. The results are a movie audience that is totally glued to their seats and to the screen. I am totally surprized that other directors haven't copied his style already. Just as in the fighting sequences of 300, Zack smacks you in the face (SuckerPunches"" you with the action and gritty realism. Visual imagery is astounding, music and sound effects plus the sighs and grunts of the female warriors composed into the score's background are dead on. Cast and costumes are sexy but totally functional. A well cast movie. Only wish there would have been an extended version of the 300 fight scenes. That movie always left me wanting more. Unfortunately he boxed himself in and never produced an extended version of the movie and left it no where to go. The only complaint on this movie is the ending. Didn't like it. And that the stepfather gets away with murder. Not a cool thing in my review of the movie. But other than that...WELL DONE ZACK. But again Zack why box yourself in. There is no where to go with a sequel in this universe. What if the audience wants to see more of ""Babydoll"" and her cool worlds and cool friends. Maybe Zack does not like sequels. Well what-ever, get the movie you will love it. Never listen to the critics. It's like someone trying to tell you how good a steak is.

It's like a video game with insanely good graphics got together with a comic book and deided to make an anime music vidio mash up, Are ypu still with me. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. As long as you not looking for a complex plot or 4 star acting. Sucker Punch is built on it's action sequences and it's clear from go that this were SAnyder's priority you sort of get the feeling that he circled back around to squeeze a story in with the deadline coming up fast. which is a shame because the story had real potential. leaving that aside and as long as you don't mind having almost the entire plot given away near the begining of the movie, Sucker Punch fires on all the cylinders that most people go to action movies for. guns,knives, a sword. creatures futuristic zombies, lots of things that go boom and hot girls in shrt skirts. it's PG13 though so if strings of profanity and sex are must haves for you, you won't find it here. So why did I give it four stars, because the action was great amd the imagery was fantastic  But above all I liked Sucker punch because I went into the theater thinking that I already know what the film would be and it ended up being somthing else amost entirely. and I love when I movie suprises me. I'll say briefly that a major plus for me was was that Babydoll dosn't stand around looking holding a gun and looking sexy while she waits for the hero to rescue her, I know this deviation from the usual action movie plot is not unheard of... Underworld, Kill Bill, Tomb Raider ect.. it's still nice to see. A quick note on the music. I think not going for a tradtional action movie score was the right call here,the songs chosen encapsulted the film and represented the characters far batter. An orchestral would have been awkward given the overall look and feel of the film.

M.,"[6, 9]","I sincerely believe that reviewers should be more honest and simply decline to write about films that they don't understand because the only problem with this film is that some people just don't get it.They only see the gun-bearing hot girls in anime-like clothes and automatically assume it's a brainless visual feast. Well, it IS a visual feast but it's WAY more than that, and by the way, the hot girls CAN act. The problem is that many people are not accustomed to use their brains during films. If it is outside the formulaic storytelling structure that most films use, it's automatically considered bad.Sucker Punch isn't a film to be simply watched.

That said, you're either going to decide this is a picture that wanted a bunch of attractive women in sexy clothing running around with Katanas, guns and other such things that go bang or you're going to see that this over the top action picture is trying to say something more of the human experience even if it isn't always elegantly presented. And it really is an over the top action picture in the spirit of a video game or high octane action comic book/graphic novel. The special effects are colorful and brilliant even if they don't always tie in to the story and viewers not familiar with comic books or video games will be put off and/or confused by the sudden shifts into the fantasies of a young girl who is going to be lobotomized in five days (it actually is a fantasy within a fantasy at times). In fact, probably less than 20 minutes are real time and most of the tale takes place in the dreams/perceptions of the main character who is trying to escape with her fellow inmates. The over the top action girls were clearly trained so they don't look dorky and the acting is above average or better mostly though some of the themes are too much on the noise at times (you're your only limitation so ""fight!""). By the way, don't expect a happy ending here. It's bittersweet at best. Most of the fantasies tie in to the real story five elements for the planned escape but they show it sometimes in a confusing or off manner so people not watching intently will miss it. Extreme feminists are claiming this picture exploits women as sexual objects and nothing more but they're dead wrong. Critics have mostly been negative towards the film and the North American Box Office total has been disappointing but it has done all right overseas and I'm sure the DVD market will help it along.STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; SPECIAL EFFECTS: B plus to A minus; THEME DELIVERY: B minus to B; OVERALL GRADE: B; WHEN WATCHED: early September 2011MEMORABLE DIALOGUE: ""Who honors those we love with the very life we live?

It's almost as if Zack Snyder went down the check list of everything you could throw into an action film. You have your giant samurai warriors, WWI era German soldiers who are full of steam rather than blood, medievil knights, orcs, dragons, a robot army and five good looking girls with big guns. This is not going to win any awards, but I had a blast. If you liked Snyder's other movies (300, Watchmen) you can pretty much expect the same CGI bonanza, but at least it's used in moderation. All of the fantasy sequences come from the main character's imagination, who just happens to be stuck in a mental hospital and looking for a way out.I know some have found the plot confusing. In fact, I overheard some guys leaving the theater saying that they liked the music and visuals, but didn't undertand it. I did not find it that hard to follow, but it could have used a little more work when it came to layering the story. I'm pretty sure a Director's Cut Blu-ray will be released with an R rating and hopefully some more scenes to help clear a couple of things up.There is a lot of music in this film and not just a background score. The lead actress, the ever so cute Emily Browning, actually sings an entire cover of ""Sweet Dreams"" over the opening scenes and the classic rock tune ""White Rabbit"" gets covered at length as well as some other nice songs.The acting and dialogue are adequate, with nobody really standing out other than the main girl.

This movie is senseless.In a nutshell, the hero does various dirty dance routines (presumably - because we never actually see the dances) in order to distract people so that her friends can steal a series of items in order to escape some sort of mental institution that doubles as a brothel.  Got all that?Why don't we see the dances you ask?  Because whenever a dance starts our hero goes into a fantasy trance and we are transported into a dream sequence where her and her fellow dancers take on zombie Nazis, dragons, robots, etc.  For example, one of the items that they need to steal is a lighter.  Therefore, the fantasy sequence involves the squad of women cutting the throat of a baby dragon, ripping out two fire crystals, and then a chase sequence with the mother dragon.I'll admit that the fantasy parts are pretty well done.  However, after the first two I found myself asking - ""Is this all there is?  Do I have to go through this two or three more times?""  In that sense, I suppose Sucker Punch is a lot like a vasectomy.  The first one is a bit of a surprise, but the second one usually hurts a little more.  Party because you know what to expect... partly because... well... it's a vasectomy.  Sucker Punch was just like that.  The first cut scene was a bit of a surprise, but then you get through it and have to endure the second one.  Unfortunately, there are more than two in this case and no warm towel to soften you up!  This movie made me want to spend two days sitting on an ice pack.In the end, I just wondered what the point was.  This movie was just barely good enough so that I didn't turn it off.  That's the only reason it gets two stars instead of one.  One star is reserved for absolute trash like GI Joe.You know how you can really tell how bad this movie is?  By how much many of the 5 star reviewers spend their time defending it.  Uhhhh... If it was five stars, it would speak for itself, right?  Apparently not, because many 5 star reviews spend time advising everyone how they ""don't get it"" etc, etc.  Yes, yes, yes... the critics were wrong, the poor reviewers are wrong... blah, blah, blah.

The problem with the action offered in Sucker Punch is that it heavily favors style over substance. Yes the action is great but it plays off more times than not as tongue and cheek. What makes it worse is that it feels like the film makers where either oblivious to this fact or masked it as well as they could.Pretty much,if you've ever played any video game from the final fantasy series think Final Fantasy X part 2 and this pretty much sums up Sucker Punch. Only this film attempts to take itself way more seriously than the before mentioned game.The extended cut of Sucker Punch is well worth watching and the cabaret style rendition of ""Love is the Drug"" is worthy viewing several times by itself.Sucker Punch is a fun experiment of a movie and is worth watching at least twice.

In my honest opinion that number is quite simply ridiculous. Sucker Punch so far has been one of the greatest films of 2011.Yes there are some scenes in this movie which some view as rip-offs of other films. Here is what I said about Hollywood in response, so what?  We live in a world where remakes come out every other week and their sequels made to 30 year old films that have no business being revisited. Sucker Punch did nothing wrong here, Sucker Punch saw great movies and said to itself what can I do better?And there were plenty of things that Sucker Punch did that were better. Look at the scene that mirrors, Lord of the Rings. Now, Lord of the Rings is one of the most treasured franchises in all of cinema but its protagonists were incredibly annoying. Sucker Punch did something that J.R.R. Tolkien was afraid to do, introduced hot women the equation. Is that really so wrong?There are other parts of this movie the mirror Kill Bill. But where Kill Bill faltered, Sucker Punch succeeded. There was only one good-looking girl in Kill Bill. Sucker Punch had several. Once again, this is much better.Other critics have said this movie too closely resembles the videogame. My answer, no such thing. Videogames try and look real, movies John look real. If every review videogame said, this looks too real then no video games would sell. The double standard in Hollywood is ridiculous here.What does it say about we as a nation when we cannot appreciate the true gems that Hollywood has put forth? Director Zack Snyder has made a masterpiece here and yet only 22% of all critics can appreciate. This is absurd.  I highly encourage you to check this movie out. You will not regret it. This movie does not set out forth to abolish laws set by its predecessors. It comes rather, to complete, and it does so quite well.Sucker Punch had so far been the greatest movie of 2011, bar none.

I expected nothing from this little movie except some eye candy and maybe some silly video game scenes- but it actually has a story which draws you in and makes you feel for the characters- if you let it. In between the CGI, eye candy, and the music is a little layered story of suffering and sacrifice, and (spoiler)....... in the end Babydoll doesn't get her wings of freedom but through her sacrifice perhaps earns a spot in a different 'paradise' (future angel?). You can make from this movie what you will, a lot, or a little which is part of its charm.As far as story telling goes this movie is great. It's paced well, has excellent music, and lots of good trippy visuals. It was a suprise to me. Instead of laughing at it I really enjoyed it.

There were a lot of flashy action scenes and something I think was supposed to be substance, but overall I merely found it average.After the death of her mother, accidental murder of her sister (she was trying to save her from her father), Baby Doll finds herself in the mental institution.  Scheduled for lobotomy, she retreats and imagines herself in a brothel where dances are the key entertainment.  Every time she dances she retreats to a fantasy world where she (and later the other girls) have to fight different beings in order to achieve their objectives.  These visions help her to understand that if she obtains some key items, she'll be able to escape.  The other girls help  her along in her plan as they struggle against their oppressors.Characters:Emily Browning: Baby DollAbbie Cornish: Sweet PeaJena Malone: RocketVanessa Hudgens: BlondieJamie Chung: AmberCarla Gugino: Vera GorskiOscar Isaac: Blue JonesJon Hamm: Doctor/High RollerScott Glen: Wise ManGerard Plunkett: StepfatherLet's face it, none of these characters were probably hired for their acting, but rather for their looks.  They did do a good job at what they did have to act at though.  In particular, Carla Gugino was very great as Vera Gorski.  At least, I liked her character the best as she was interesting.  Baby Doll I wasn't as fond of, while being slightly crazy, she seemed a little too wise for her character at times and it just wasn't realistic (yes I know, its a mental institution with delusions, but still).  The other girls probably would have been great, but it almost seemed like their roles were stifled in favor of Baby Doll's.The plot was a bit convoluted.  There was delusions within delusions and it could get somewhat confusing at times.  Honestly, I don't think this movie was aimed at me as a viewer base but rather teenage boys.  There was a lot of pretty girly type scenes and actions scenes with swords, guns, and monsters.  Despite this though, there was nothing really graphic or strong language used much so I would say that it definitely is ok for younger viewers.  I do have to comment that the special effects were done very well.  All of the scenes were great but I especially liked the scene where the monsters spewed steam instead of blood.  It was just a great effect and not gory as most are.  The music was pretty good too, all of it was haunting but it fit in with the movie very well.It was ok, but as said before, I don't think that it was aimed at me as a viewer group.  I'm sure other people would love it a lot more than I did.Review by M.

1401118,A2K6VDHSE2NU4R,B004EPYZU8,Nachtjager,"[2, 2]","There are a lot of hardcore &#34;love it&#34; or &#34;hate it&#34; reviews on this movie.  I got it and watched it last weekend with my wife and nursing school-age daughter, not expecting a whole lot except for very nice visual effects.  You do get a LOT of very nice visual effects - the CG work in the film is stunning and the camera work throughout the movie is fantastic.  About twenty minutes into this movie, you will think you've got the whole thing completely figured out and it does seem rather simplistic and predictable if you've got any film smarts at all.  So, I was impressed by the visuals but not so much the story - until the last ten minutes of the movie!Those who don't understand why this is called &#34;Sucker Punch&#34; or who don't like the film simply did not understand the end of the movie.  I'm a feature editor for a publishing company and do a lot of writing myself, and I NEVER saw this ending coming, and it does completely rearrange the entire movie and instantly made me want to scan back through it.  We watched it again late the next day, and sure enough, the director planted countless signals throughout the movie that tied into the ending that you simply don't notice until you know to look for them.  The way this thing ended makes it a brilliant piece of writing and it made the otherwise seemingly &#34;shallow&#34; story very deep indeed.On that note, as mentioned, I watched it with my wife and daughter, who are both darned clever (in my opinion) and while I was sitting there on the couch going &#34;Whoa!&#34;  at the end, they were both looking rather confused.  I knew they hadn't &#34;got it&#34; and asked them to explain what we'd just watched, and sure enough, neither one of them &#34;got it&#34; at all.  Once I forked over the explanation, they were both going &#34;OH!!! Well that make sense!&#34; and tossing around &#34;Never saw that coming&#34; and things of that nature - which led to us watching the movie again the next night.As to those complaining about the scanty clothing - please!  Generally the girls are wearing dance practice attire, no different than was seen throughout &#34;White Christmas&#34; back in 1954 and nobody's thrown into a fit over that.  You'll see a lot more skin watching practically anything, and you certainly see a lot more sexy outfits if you go to any grown-up Halloween party.  There are no boobs shown here, no naked butts, and the girls only appear in their vampy outfits shown on the cover and in all the Youtube videos when they're in the fairly short fantasy combat sequences.Over all, if you liked Inception, Shutter Island, Moulin Rouge, or just like action movies in general, you'll probably like this movie.  If you like movies that take you by surprise and make you rethink them and analyze them (like I do), then you'll probably love this movie.  If you want something simple and linear, like &#34;The Hangover&#34; crap like that, you will hate this film because you will not understand it - sorry, but there it is.  If you love Duck Dynasty and you think American Idol is actually real, avoid this movie because you won't understand it.On a parting note with regards to some of the other reviews, this is NOT &#34;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&#34; - which is a movie that's similar in its dark and stylistic CG work, but was a complete failure in having a decent story line.  As much as I wanted to like THAT movie (which I ended up not liking at all), I was rather expecting the same out of Sucker Punch.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised that my initial impressions of Sucker Punch were completely wrong, and this ended up being a VERY interesting little movie - and the music's pretty good too!

1401120,A11S26M1MUM7O7,B004EPYZU8,Neil Ford,"[1, 2]","I think that Sucker Punch is a much better and more interesting film than many critics give it credit for. I don't, however, think that the subtle machinations of the plot layers are the point of the film, or should be used to intellectually justify it by saying ""complex=good"". For me, this film is less an intellectual exercise than a stream-of-consciousness expression of emotion; it's about feeling powerless, and escaping that feeling through fantasy. The mechanics of the plot are just there to support the emotional content.After the plot's complexity, the most controversial part of the film is the ""video game"" action sequences. Honestly, I am a bit iffy about them conceptually, as their relationship to the main plot is extremely tenuous, but to my surprise I found these sequences mostly very engaging and even moving. The exception to this was the sequence that most needed to be emotionally engaging - the train heist. It might have been because it was poorly directed, or because I was worn out by the preceding action scenes. Whatever the reason, I found this part just didn't work. It's the one big flaw of the piece.Another controversial element often mentioned is the skimpy outfits the heroines wear. I don't think the allegations of sexism are valid as generally stated. If women are working at an exotic dance club, it is natural that they would ""hang out"" in their costumes or in their underwear - this is pretty much standard for back-stage behaviour. I didn't find the photography at all leering. What might be questionable is the fetish outfits* the heroines wear during the ""video game"" sequences. This is part of a wider argument about the double-image of feisty female protagonists, going back at least to the Alien movies, and I don't think Sucker Punch will solve the argument conclusively for either side.Maybe these diverse criticisms are inevitable if you try to combine accessible contemporary action with arthouse explorations of plot and emotion.

1401127,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B004EPYZU8,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[10, 15]","Sucker Punch has such an extraordinary trailer that there ought to be an Oscar category for trailers, just to reward it. That may be the only recognition the film ever gets, because no full length feature film in history could live up to that kind promise, just in terms of sheer bombast. And, judging by the initial critical reaction, nor has this one got a Babydoll's chance in a House for the Mentally Insane of getting any industry recognition: it's going down like a burning zeppelin with the critics. A ""crass women's penitentiary picture reconceived for today's manga- and vidgame-savvy crowd"" says one (presumably not manga- and ""vidgame"" savvy) critic; ""built so as to dispense with the need for narrative logic"" says another. A pity, because I think the critics are wildly wrong here. With any luck the public will have a different view, because Sucker Punch almost lives up to its trailer.It could be the greatest fantasy motion picture sinceThe Matrix. It could also be the greatest disaster since The Hindenburg. In either case the ringside seat is a scorcher.Let's see, then.In fairness, the film does miss a couple of the trailer's features: There's no Led Zeppelin on the soundtrack, for one thing. Nonetheless, Zack Snyder uses every trick in the book. It's beautifully shot. Every frame is a gem. The technology - there's more green screen here than inSky Captain & The World Of Tomorrow- is sympathetic, clever and impressive. It's artistic. It oozes style. It is in glorious two dimensions.There's a little preamble which winds up in an all-girl asylum before things descend impossibly into a psychotic imaginarium of kick-ass ninja dolls, samurai, monster robots, fire-breathing dragons, sepia-tinted Nazi zeppelins and crash-&-burning bi-planes: yea: all of the above. Amongst it all, statuesque, like a serene core at the eye of the storm is super-cool Scott Glenn, a multiple personality avatar dispensing one-line platitudes to his jailbait harem as if the structural integrity of universe required it. He intones Alexander Hamilton's aphorism: ""Stand for something, or you'll fall for anything"".Sucker Punch, indeed, stands for everything. Anything, even. So much does it play like a seventeen-year-old's wet dream that it is tempting to write it off as one.It would appear many critics have been duly tempted. Their major complaints: Lack of wit. No plot. Wafer-thin characters. Gratuitous girlitude. The last two, sure - but, come on: the context is comic book bravura. What did you expect:Kurosawa? Yes, parts of it are like stages of a video game, they are meant to be. Sucker Punch borrows from The Matrix, but repays with interest.But lack of wit? This is a brilliantly funny picture. And no plot? Au contraire: that's a different story. In their haste to write this off, I fear the critics have forgotten to pay attention. Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury: before you bemoan a lack of intellectual endeavour, use some of your own: at least have a go at trying to puzzle things out. And there are some puzzles, if you only look for them: narrative peculiarities which Snyder has gone to some lengths to achieve. It's only fair to suppose he did this for a reason.Firstly, the opening scene: pay attention. We open in a vaudeville theatre. The velvet curtains open on a set that is a young girl's bedroom. We see a blonde girl sitting on her bed with her back to us. Take note: This is a theatrical set of some description. It's a play. It's not real. The camera tracks in and around the girl on the bed, and as it does so the set resolves into an actual house. Then we see the girl's face. It is Babydoll (Emily Browning). Note how we are introduced to Babydoll: on a stage. It is important.Babydoll's mother is dead. An Evil Stepfather circles like a vulture. He tries to have his way with Babydoll. She resists. He locks the door, and turns to Babydoll's little sister. Babydoll tries to intervene, but little sister winds up dead. Again, remember this. Look out for parallels with other characters later in the movie.Babydoll is framed for her sister's murder and corruptly declared insane. She is institutionalised and maliciously scheduled for a quick lobotomy. Again, note how this happens: To a reworking of Eurhythmics' Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This), a Black Maria rolls up the hill to ""Lennox House"", an institution ""FOR THE MENTALLY INSANE"" - or just of sweet dreams? Warders and orderlies leer. Babydoll is given a tour. She winds up in a common room full of crazies called ""the theatre"". At this point there is a sudden and jarring transition from Asylum to Bordello. Suddenly we are in a Burlesque Club of some sort - where did the Asylum go? We meet a showgirl Sweetpea, during a rehearsal. She breaks off, mid scene, aghast at the notion that the production should contemplate her character, an orphan, being sent to an asylum for a lobotomy. Again, note this scene.These are hardly subtle clues. Yet still this secret seems to have eluded Hollywood's finest: Is this film really about Babydoll? It is not. Whose world is imaginary and whose is real?Sucker Punch is certainly not perfect - it's 20 minutes too long, and for a film featuring five bombshells in their knickers, it is oddly sexless. Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac) is a bloodless villain. But as far as science fiction/fantasy goes, it is so much more sophisticated and imaginative thanAvatar,The Last Airbenderor utterly pitiful Mars Needs Moms as indeed to seem like Kurosawa. It is stylish. It is witty. It has more bombast than Elton John's birthday. It has an attention span of about thirty seconds.A Matrix, therefore, for the YouTube generation.

1401128,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B004EPYZU8,Only-A-Child,"[3, 4]","Basically ""Sucker Punch"" is an $80+ Million laser light show; projected laser beams set to music (in this case nicely produced by Marius De Vries and Tyler Bates).  This type of entertainment was quite popular in the theaters during the 1970's (see ""Freaks and Geeks"") as a psychedelic entertainment (Pink Floyd, ELO, Blue Oyster Cult).  Laser light was useful in entertainment because the coherent nature of laser light allows a narrow beam to be produced, so optical scanning can draw patterns and images on walls, ceilings or other surfaces. Reflected beams can be bounced to targeted positions with mirrors to create laser sculptures.  Focused minds are held spellbound by the focused and concentrated light rays.  With the advent of computer generated special effects, recreational drugs like ecstasy, and polysubstance use (kitty flipping anyone?); the light show has evolved into a feature film form.  ""Sucker Punch"" being one of the most ambitious.  One segment of the audience connects with this experience and another one does not, then both get on the internet and lament their disbelief that others are showing so much hate (or love) toward the film.  Few find a middle ground as illustrated by the paucity of three star ratings.In the case of ""Sucker Punch"",  far more were disappointed than were impressed.  Much the same reaction occurred with Tim Burton's 2010 laser light show titled ""Alice In Wonderland"".  So if you hated that film you would be wise to avoid ""Sucker Punch"".  Although liking Burton's film is no guarantee that you will like ""Sucker Punch"", as Burton is a skilled acting for the camera director and there was simply no indication that such a skill set was present during the production phase of ""Sucker Punch"".At about the 25 minute mark of ""Sucker Punch"" I was beginning to believe that it was something special.  In just 25 minutes the film had taken its main character (nicely underplayed by Emily Browning) through three stages of madness.  I was expecting this progression (or descent) into madness to continue in the manner of a high budget and surreal homage to Polanski's ""Repulsion"" (1965).  That is as a hellbound train that never looks back; with it's heroine's point of view fracturing in a steady progression of more bizarre realities.  Unfortunately, ""Sucker Punch's"" train spent itself in those early minutes and spends the remainder of the film disappointingly vacillating between the 2nd and 3rd stages of madness, before mercifully bookending itself with a return to the 1st stage.The problem is that by its nature a laser light show lacks or struggles with certain cinematic elements; like audience to character identification, sensuality, suspense, and challenge to the imagination (there is nothing to imagine when the fundamental construct is one of visual illustration).  Which is fine if you connect with what it brings (in place of these missing elements) to its audience; like off-kilter production design, dazzling special effects, eye-popping action. But it is important for a viewer to be aware of the nature and limitations of this type of entertainment if they are to avoid frustration and disappointment.Then again, what do I know?

Given all the negative press, I went in with low expectations, hoping at the very least to see a visually cool bit of entertaining action fluff. But Sucker Punch couldn't even get over that rather low bar, expecting audiences to take its bad writing, bad acting, unoriginal/overdone slo-mo effects, and ridiculous premise as serious, metaphysically weighty drama -- yes folks, you're supposed to CARE and THINK DEEPLY about those underage uzi-and-fake-eyelash-toting hookers shooting zombie Krauts in the face while sporting sequined Sailor Moon outfits! Forget ""The Matrix,"" this movie has even grander and dumber ambitions, fashioning itself as something like a new version of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" only with 100% more CG dragons and ninjas.Even most of the music is offensive, with some of rock's coolest tunes butchered in distractingly bad fashion by newer acts (including the lead actress, whose bad acting can be partly excused by the awful script, but whose weak take on Eurythmics' ""Sweet Dreams"" is nobody's fault but her own). Using the original songs would actually have helped the movie a little bit, e.g., the epic-carnage-loving geek in me might have enjoyed seeing a helicopter shoot missiles at a moving train if the song playing in the background had been the awesome original version of the Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" (one of the more bada*s songs of the '60s) instead of a lame cover by new indie artists who shoulda known better.Look, I am by no means a movie snob -- I love good action flicks whether they're thought-provoking or terminally dumb, so long as they're entertaining and don't insult the audience's intelligence. But this multimillion-dollar turkey is not worth even renting. And don't get me started on all those five-star commentators who spend much of their reviews deriding the many professional critics and theater-goers who panned the movie, lamenting that we didn't ""get it."" Newsflash, folks: just b/c we think the movie is a piece of crap doesn't mean we didn't understand it, so why don't you keep your reviews focused on the movie itself rather than on people who disagree with you?

1401144,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B004EPYZU8,P. Hardy,"[2, 5]","AFTER HEARING SO MUCH BAD about Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch, I really expected to dislike this movie. However, I'm glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised by what I've watched and this is the theatrical cut of the film I'm talking about (I've seen at least three deleted scenes exclusive to the BLU-RAY on YouTube and it's simply up to my mind to fill in the blanks when I watch the movie on DVD and those particular scenes happen to be missing).For the most part, I think I'll just skip over my opinions on the all the Feminist arguments and follow-the-leader ""I'll compare to this movie to a movie that came out a year earlier"" commentary that I've seen on around the internet. I'll simply say that for the most part, I think most of the things said about this movie are in fact valid as far as Feminist critique is concerned. Zack Snyder, try as he might, doesn't understand feminism and empowerment for women and shamelessly attempts to cover his fantasy behind a flimsy veil of fan service and a love for how certain types of anime depict females. It wants to subvert the degrading ways women are depicted in media, but it fails in every way possible on this aspect. But is the movie bad because of it? No, not really. It's more embarrassing than anything because it reflects just how badly feminism is misunderstood and seen by general [male] populace on a whole.However, when it comes to knocking an otherwise enjoyable action flick for being an ""Inception"" / ""Matrix"" ripoff, this is where a lot of the complaints lose me. People did the same thing with ""PUSH(2009)"", a sci-fi/superhero movie (I that I loved) that  has almost nothing in common with 2008's ""JUMPER"" (a poor adaption of an otherwise great sic-fi novel by Steven Gould) outside of the ""Evil Organization out to get the protagonist"" plot and what movie doesn't use that theme? Sucker Punch has superficial similarities to ""Inception"" (who's concept is by no means as original as its EXECUTION) and the ""Matrix"" and that's where the buck stops.If I have anything bad to say about this movie it's the fact that you cannot skip the DVD Advertisement to get to the DVD Menu (at least on the Rental DVD version). There has to be a told of six to ten minutes worth of BLU-RAY-COMING SOON-NOW ON DVD ads shoved down your throat and you can't skip any of it. That aside, the storyline is as simple as it gets:[A girl, codenamed ""Baby Doll"", and her unnamed little sister have suffered the loss of their equally unnamed their mother and are left with a rotten stepfather as their guardian. When he discovers that his wife has left everything to her two daughters, he throws a fit and decides he's going to have his way with the oldest girl. However, when she rebels, he locks her in her bedroom and goes after her little sister (who ends up evading him and locking herself in a closet with his keys). In a panic, Baby Doll exits her bedroom through her window and reenters the house armed with a gun just as the stepfather kicks the closet door open.However, she misses her intended target and kills her sister instead. She's understandably grief stricken that she's robbed herself of the one person that mattered to her and is left with the one she could do without and run from the house. The cops find her at her mother's grave and her stepfather gets her admitted to a presumably all-female insane asylum where she awaits a lobotomy in five days. However, Baby Doll has no intentions of waiting to a hole punched into her head and enlists the help of four girls (Sweet Pea, Rocket, Amber and Blondie) to get her and themselves out of the madhouse. In order to do this, they need five items (a Lighter, Map, Key, Knife and one unnamed item that will be the decider of how the plan goes), but all of them are under the guard of those who would keep them locked inside the madhouse (or brothel, depending how Baby Doll depicts her reality).]Other than that, the enjoyment of the movie hinges on how well the actresses perform and how much you enjoy stylized action sequences straight out of an anime realized by someone who knows how to blend the overtop with visually stunning universes out of a fantasy book and not detract from the overall point of the movie. And with that, for a movie that literally runs on the fuel of a screenplay written by himself, Snyder does a good job. He gets the point of his tale across better than most would be willing to admit. It's certainly not the tasteless and fetishized movie a lot of people made it out to be.When the characters interact with one another it doesn't come off an contrite or something made to kill time between action sequences; on more than one occasion, three out of the five female characters have a actual conversation with each other and the movie is better for it, I think. The relationship between sisters, Rocket and Sweet Pea, as unexplored as it is, for me, was the most genuine part of the movie. The actors Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone, made me believe that they were siblings on polarizing ends of a situation that was guaranteed to fail if something went wrong.However, the one thing he does fail on is the entire concept of a Sucker Punch. Granted, it's no surprise what happens to Baby Doll (they show it at the beginning of the movie for goodness sake), but Between Scott Glenn and Jon Hammm, I'm not sure who gave away the meaning of the entire ending more. The Doctor/High Roller or the Wiseman who likes quote Grandpa from ""The Jackie Chan Adventures""? If I was surprised by anything it was how abrupt the cut between the close up on Baby Dolls face to the lobotomy needle was, other than that, one of the two the characters I wanted to see get out of that place alive, did and therefore I was content.I, for one, enjoyed all four universes created by Baby Doll, paricularly the Medieval Japan and Futuristic city that bookend the first and final acts of the movie. The action sequences, complemented with a impressive soundtrack of varying sounds and styles of cover songs or remixes of the better known singles of days gone bye, are executed with perfection. The music video feel of it all works well with the interpretation that Baby Doll's dances are interpreted by her mind through violence and a way to achieve her goals which coincide with one another.  I'm not even disappointed in the fact that we never get to see her dance as that was never one of the things I was dying to see in this movie.The acting for the most part is good. Emily Browning isn't a terrible actress, she gets the personality (or lack thereof) and determination of Baby Doll's character across to the audience rather well, but if anything she was one of the weaker performers of the primary cast. Vanessa Hudgens doesn't do a bad job in a movie that is basically her way of trying to become an adult in the wrong way most young actresses tend to do, but she isn't awful until she tries to cry on screen.The actress who plays Amber isn't given anything to do except play wingman for most the movie and therefore has the weakest performance in the movie because she isn't given anything worth its weight in significance. Honestly, the strongest actors in the movie are Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone, who are given more do in the action and non-action sequences any of the other girls combined, especially if you adopt the idea that the tale of the movie is basically a story told in the second person narrative and the story is really about the two sisters (the oldest in particular). I was a little more than misty-eyed at one particular scene between the two (in both realities) just because of how they performed.The orderlies and doctors were just there, I really had no emotional investment in any of them and therefore really can't comment on them other than to say, the orderly-turned-pimp's mustache was the only thing I could look at when he was one screen and, yes, indeed, the Polish accent for the doctor is something out of Rocky and Bulwinkle, but it's hardly distracting in any sense that it's bad. At least the actress is consistent.All in all Sucker Punch is a good movie that does a excellent job of blending fantasy with action and anime with live-action (even if that was unintended or not even a thought in the visual effects artists mind). The movie is a beauty to look at on every level possible. Snyder's direction is competent, but it's nowhere near what he did for ""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""Watchmen"". I don't think Sucker Punch is great by any means or that I'm even in love with it, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. [4 Out of 5]",4,"""Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream.

And that's what the movie (on the surface) wants you to buy into.Pretty girls who dance and show skin and seduce their clientele while secretly.....trying to escape the near prison like circumstances they live in.  The movie itself has a comic book/surrealistic (pillow) aspect to itA very seductive soundtrack adds a lot to the movie itself and I think enhances every scene.

1401151,A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ,B004EPYZU8,Private Quentin Tarantino Fan,"[210, 283]","Note: I wrote an original review for the film only way back when I saw it, which was actually on opening day.  Now that I have acquired the Blu-Ray version of Sucker Punch, I will write a review.  My consensus though is to purchase the Blu-Ray package over the DVD, so if you just want to read my thoughts on the movie, skip this section.  I will review the Blu-Ray.  If you are wanting to know everything about the layout and the general features, Amazon is correct with both product descriptions, so you can trust them.When I first saw Sucker Punch in theaters, the art direction, CGI, and the colors was absolutely jaw dropping; this was one of the movies that I could see blasting on my TV screen. Well, I am happy to report that Sucker Punch looks and sounds terrific on Blu-Ray.  Given the sensory overload Sucker Punch provides, one can only imagine how the potential of the , and the transfer does its justice and brings Sucker Punch to complete life upon your HD TV.  The picture is crystal clear and sharp, which gives way to an absolutely dazzling high definition picture on screen.  Sucker Punch's intense colors, elaborate architecture, and stylized visuals all come to life onscreen, with a visual intensity on the same boat as any high production value video game would be able to achieve (Think Uncharted 2 or God of War 3.  Sucker Punch can surely compete with both games in terms of visual splendor).  All the little details of the visual intensity absolutely stand out and are crystal clear.  You can see everything little snow-flake, bit of explosion, and piece of dust, yet the little details don't substantiate the stylized and beautiful landscape and architecture.  I give the picture an easy 10.  It looks absolutely amazing.  So safe to say, it is ABSOLUTELY worth buying for television viewing.The audio is not quite as impressive as the picture of the film (seems fitting, however, given the visual approach to the film), but the sound is no slouch either (I think this has to do with the fact that the Sound design by default is not as good as, say, Saving Private Ryan or Lord of the Rings).  Sucker Punch will still work out your home theater system, so if you have a great sound system, it's time to watch Sucker Punch with it.  The movie really takes advantage of the DTS Sound track, as you will be able to hear the explosions surround you, the bullets clanking, whizzing, and whining and all around you, and the adjacent sound effects to the visual keys that Zack Snyder is so fond of using is crystal clear and satisfying.  Your theater will rumble, and you will be totally surrounded by the immersive sound to really match the whole movie.  What else could you ask for?  I give the sound a 10, although the sound design is a 9.As most of you already know, the Blu-Ray version of Sucker Punch adds 18 minutes to the movie.  This is a whole 18 minutes of new film footage. More dialogue is added to certain scenes, and while they really don't radically make the story better in a way, it does add some fluency and color to the movie.  These add more color and life to the characters and situations.  There is also more action to make those peaks and valleys of the action more effective, and there are a couple more graphic shots to the action scenes, as there is a bit more gore.  There is also the cut scene that Snyder had to remove (which deals with a sexual encounter),  The most prominent addition to the film is a eye catching and theatrical musical number, and it doesn't at all tone down the pure visual and aural onslaught the movie previously had.  I'm not going to give out spoilers but the is worth seeing and makes the movie even more of a blast than it was in theaters.  Really, what else can you ask for?As far as the rest of the special features go, here they are.Maximum Movie Moment with Zack Snyder: The informative and fun special feature from the Watchmen Blu-Ray returns for another round, with Zack Snyder stepping out of the director's chair to give us more insight as to how the film was made, all interactive and almost feels hands-on to an extent.  In the Maximum Movie Moment, Zack Snyder discusses how certain interesting and intricate shots and portions of the film were made, which really satisfy the question of ""How did they film that?"".  He is not on-screen the whole time, but there's more than enough useful information to make the feature very worthwhile and awesome.  In addition, some sketches and storyboards are thrown into the mix.  Zack Snyder really shows how, and with something as interesting and useful as what he does with MMM, who needs it?*Sucker Punch: Behind the Soundtrack-A somewhat interesting mini-feature regarding the unique and stylistically interesting sound track.  Unfortunately, it's wait too short.  Giving the short running time (only 3 minutes), Zack Snyder and and company do not go into much detail when it comes to the soundtrack.  They basically just give a loose overview of how they came up with the soundtrack.  That's it.  Sure, it's interesting, but honestly, however, it's not a must see special feature.*Four motion comics: These four ""comics"" remind me of a moving graphic novel of sorts.  I think they are not substantial, but they do give background and interesting that further flesh out parts of the film.  On the downside, each of them are only 3-4 minutes, and there are only four of them.  At least they cut to the chase, which, actually, may strengthen their impact.In addition, the Blu-Ray Combo pack, as you can tell, also comes with a Digital copy and a DVD of the theatrical release (NOT a Blu-Ray version).  Be quick though with the Digital copy; however, as all of the digital copies I have owned eventually expire.Finally, should you get Blu-Ray or DVD?  As mentioned before, I do not own the DVD, however, my best advice would be to spend the extra money on the Blu-Ray version of the movie.  The Sucker Punch DVD is a bit too bare bones, as the two special feature that the DVD have the run time of less than 20 minutes.  Another nail in the coffin when it comes to the two is that the price of the Blu-Ray is not much greater than the DVD.  Personally, I would recommend springing for the Blu-Ray version, hands down.  If you do not own a Blu-Ray player and have no intention of ever getting one, I can see why one could settle for the DVD.  But if you in any way have a choice between the two, I would recommend spring for the Blu-Ray version for sure.ORIGINAL REVIEW:After being disappointed with Battle: LA in theaters a couple weeks ago, I crossed my fingers and hoped that Sucker Punch would be the good Spring movie that kicks a major amount of @$$, like Kick @$$ did last year.  Well, I put my trust in Zack Synder, and he didn't disappoint.  Sucker Punch has got some critical backlash, but what for?  Who cares anyway?  Sucker Punch, with thrilling action, a massive scope, the patented Zack Snyder style of film making, and absolutely GORGEOUS imagery sensory overload, make this film a must see.  It also happens to have some actual decent acting (well, a little over the top, but for this movie it makes sense) and a plot that actually not half brain dead.So what is this movie about anyway?  Well Sucker Punch, while not totally original (the film conjures up many other works as influences, such as Alice in Wonderland, Philip K. Dick, and The Matrix), is a film that blends themes such as freedom, reality, identity, the power of imagination, and escapism, among other things.  Sucker Punch is a film that deals with a young girl who is framed for murder, and is about to experience a lobotomy.  Given five days of her sanity, she then makes a list of things she needs to escape the institution.  Through dancing in order to distract certain members of the mental institution/brothel to get the things she needs to escape (yes, you read that right), she teams up with four other patients to escape the place they have been held in.Character development, I'll admit, is pretty sparse here.  You pretty much know the characters themselves very quickly, and there's nothing too revealing or deep about them.  Thankfully though, the film manages to make the characters interesting and likable, thanks to the acting.  Sure, you don't find any Oscar winning performances here, but I think it works by just letting the actresses and actors just act like, well human beings, and it's very much present here (that is, if people actually pay attention).  I actually think this work better than trying to add a bunch of stupid back stories that we've all heard a million times before; a cheap way to try to humanize a character if you ask me.  Snyder is also able to milk the likability of these young actresses to make, them, well, likable, so for all of it's positive aspects characters are not really a problem.  As long as you are not expecting the character study that Snyder's Watchmen was a couple years ago, there won't be much problem here.Sucker Punch, also, has a very emotional undercurrent to it's dilemmas, which was all the more powerful and effective.  There's something about the motives of these people and what they are doing that really gives the film the various subtexts it needs, no small feet there.  Sure, it's still an action film at heart, but Sucker Punch does leave quite a bit to talk about, and no harm can come from that.  All well and good, but that's not even the best part of the movie.....The best part though, is this film is a VISUAL medium no halls barred.  I've seen three Snyder films, and Sucker Punch outclasses both 300 AND Watchmen.  Snyder sure knows how to really use the visual film medium, and Sucker Punch holds nothing back.  Iconic slow motion everywhere, massive sweeping cinematography, and a unique melding of aesthetic make Sucker Punch have more visual delights in one film that the most of the other bid budget films released every year do combined.  Most importantly, Snyder has a sense of wonder and awe that so many countless big budget action films are sorely lacking, the imagery forces your to look on.  I must have sat in the theater with my jaw dropped the whole two hours.  From huge castles and dragons, dark and grimy asylum halls, Gothic WW1 wastelands with zombies, to a truly awesome futuristic land of trains, futuristic cities set in a galaxy next to a planet.  In addition, music and sound also plays a integral role as well, with tons of great sound effects, and a soundtrack with songs from Jefferson Airplane, Pixies, and The Beatles filtered through a dark, almost cyberpunk type of aesthetic, as sweeping as the imagery on screen.  Indeed, everything about the film making is first rate.The elaborate worlds that Babydoll and company are thrust into are amazing to look at. Massive, eclectic, and designed with incredible detail, Snyder did not stop at all in making truly immersible and jaw dropping worlds. Add that with Snyder's great use of music, and you got one heck of a great movie experience. These worlds are as imaginative as you would expect from any Grade A video game, and Snyder doesn't hold anything back in his head. You won't get any lukewarm art design when these action scenes hit the screen (in case you haven't figured it out, all the action scenes are in their head). Speaking of the action, it's, for a lack of a better word, absolutely thrilling. It's just as good as you would expect from Snyder. Massive monster fights from cool looking Samurais to dragons, lot's of guns, huge explosions, heart stopping action that feels like it can pirouette on a dime, it's all here and more. It doesn't let up the intensity either, and each one is a roller coaster ride of sheer movie delight. It has all the giddy thrill you would get from watching movies such as Transformers, 300 (yes, same director I know), or Kill Bill (although obviously not R rated), so that's a big compliment on Snyder's part.Alright, if my rambling hasn't convinced you already that this movie is worth seeing, then you might as well skip it.  Ignore the critical backlash Sucker Punch has received.  It's totally worth seeing.  It's clear that Zack Snyder always takes pride in his films and loves making them to make them, and it shines through here.  As long as you are not expecting Andrei Rublev or a Mike Leigh film, you should at least go into the movie knowing what you are going to get.  Sucker Punch, thanks to the visionary and imaginative directing of Zack Snyder, is easily an action film that, well, beats out the competition.

1401152,A34SB80MWK7BOQ,B004EPYZU8,"Raggson Media ""RM""","[4, 6]","I'll break down my review into the following sections:1. Initial thoughts on movie2. Video, Audio Quality3. Special Features1. I initially heard a ton of bad reviews about this movie; most people were disappointed with the execution considering all the hype. I never saw the movie in a  theater, but rather rented it on blu-ray and then decided to buy it, especially when I found out that the Two-Disc Extended Edition had an R-rated version of the film that had an additional ~20 minutes. I also wanted to see the extra features. As far as the film goes, it's a got a pretty simple story that is easy to follow, a linear plot (for the most part), and plenty of visually impressive effects, typical of Zack Snyder. The few complaints that I have about the film itself is that the characters are not very well developed (which is improved slightly in the extended version), and some of the more visually impressive scenes are not well integrated into the story and seem more like they were incorporated as a means of showing off the capabilities of CG. 7/10 in this aspect.2. In regards to the actual video and audio quality, the blu-ray transfer was excellent and the video quality, even for blu-ray is pretty incredible. I cannot imagine watching this film is anything less than full 1080p high-resolution. The audio is synced well and complements the stunning visual effects well throughout the film. Multiple coding options are available on the disc, so it can be optimized for any home theater setup. 9/10 here.3. The special features, while not incredibly extensive, make a huge difference when choosing to rent or buy this film. The extended version does not dramatically change the quality of the film, but does provide a little more time for character development without interrupting the flow of the narrative. A relatively unique feature is ""Maximum Movie Mode"" which is also found on Watchmen and is basically a visual commentary by Director Zack Snyder. If you are into the film-making process, this alone makes this product worth buying. There are a lot of photo galleries and stills that I don't find very interesting, but overall the special features are top notch. 7/10 for these.",4,"Visually striking, Good Extras, Not 300 or Watchmen quality",1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,2196,"[""'ll"", 'break', 'down', 'review', 'following', 'sections:1', 'Initial', 'thoughts', 'movie2', 'Video', 'Audio', 'Quality3', 'Special', 'Features1', 'initially', 'heard', 'ton', 'bad', 'reviews', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'were', 'disappointed', 'execution', 'considering', 'hype', 'never', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'rather', 'rented', 'blu-ray', 'then', 'decided', 'buy', 'especially', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Two-Disc', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'had', 'R-rated', 'version', 'film', 'had', 'additional', '~20', 'minutes', 'also', 'wanted', 'see', 'extra', 'features', 'As', 'far', 'film', 'got', 'pretty', 'simple', 'story', 'easy', 'follow', 'linear', 'plot', 'most', 'part', 'plenty', 'visually', 'impressive', 'effects', 'typical', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'few', 'complaints', 'have', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'improved', 'slightly', 'extended', 'version', 'more', 'visually', 'impressive', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'integrated', 'story', 'seem', 'more', 'were', 'incorporated', 'means', 'showing', 'off', 'capabilities', 'CG', '7/10', 'aspect.2', 'regards', 'actual', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'was', 'excellent', 'video', 'quality', 'even', 'blu-ray', 'pretty', 'incredible', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'watching', 'film', 'anything', 'less', 'full', '1080p', 'high-resolution', 'audio', 'synced', 'well', 'stunning', 'visual', 'effects', 'well', 'film', 'Multiple', 'coding', 'options', 'are', 'available', 'disc', 'can', 'be', 'optimized', 'home', 'theater', 'setup', '9/10', 'here.3', 'special', 'features', 'not', 'incredibly', 'extensive', 'make', 'huge', 'difference', 'when', 'choosing', 'rent', 'buy', 'film', 'extended', 'version', 'not', 'dramatically', 'change', 'quality', 'film', 'provide', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'interrupting', 'flow', 'narrative', 'relatively', 'unique', 'feature', 'Maximum', 'Movie', 'Mode', 'also', 'found', 'Watchmen', 'basically', 'visual', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'are', 'film-making', 'process', 'alone', 'product', 'worth', 'buying', 'are', 'lot', 'photo', 'galleries', 'stills', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'very', 'interesting', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'top', 'notch', '7/10']",Sucker Punch

Or at least, if we're getting different cuts of movies. Because I've often found myself walking out going ""Did I see a different movie than the critics?""Of course, Snyder is no stranger to critical disdain. He may be the most misunderstood director out there. True his films aren't foreveryone, but if you look close enough you may just find something there. And Sucker Punch is the biggest example of how big a visionary he is- Here he manages to bring to the table a satisfying and exciting new vision.I was in right from the opening scene. A cover of Sweet Dreams set to a fantastic and tone setting scene depicting her abuse from her wicked stepfather. WHAT an opening scene.We are then transported to Mount Pleasant Insane Asylum, once a performing arts venue. Baby Doll is just a drop in the ocean of howmany beautiful girls who can dance. Baby Doll doesn't know this until she saves Rocket, another one of the girls. There she meets the rest of the gang, and the sexy Goski, a doctor who has a form of therapy- dance. When Baby Doll dances, she can slay dragons, fight robots, wield swords, etc. The girls love her- but as it stands, she's dancing... to escape from the asylum with the girls.The concept may not sound dazzling- but wait till you see it. Sucker Punch is what its title states- a conceptual sucker punch. Nothing can prepare you for what you will experience. You are in the world with Baby Doll- you feel as if you are experiencing Baby Doll's therapy with her. Snyder totally does a great job with this aspect, and as a theatre nerd and dance lover, arts as therapy really hit home because it's very true, and I've experienced that euphoria from being a performer.The acting is fantastic, and Emily Browning is great as both an action chick and a confused, disturbed girl. Cugino is sexy and adds her usual charm to her role. Hamm as Blue is easily the best, as his villain is certainly convincing.Add to that, one of the best soundtracks ever put to film. Working with Tyler Bates, Browning covers a few songs, and quite a few others contribute too. And Bjork's ""Army of Me"" has never sounded cooler.I was skeptical- Snyder has struck gold with 300, Watchmen and Guardians, but could he manage to make one of his original ideas spark?As a result he can- and he did. Do NOT be a puppet of the critics- experience Sucker Punch with an open mind.

Allen""","[1, 2]","Format: Blu RayPros:Got the three disc edition for under $8Came with a free comicAbbie Cornish, Emily Browning, Jenna Malone, Jamie Chung, Carla Gugino are all great actressesThe music selection is very goodCons:Empty storyOverly darkPoor use of high caliber starsVery Grainy Blu Ray transfer5.1 sound is awful and constantly having to raise and lower volumeWith a cast like this, I was hoping for a better movie. I really enjoy Zack Snyder's work. I loved Watchmen and Man of Steel looks promising (going to see it in a few days). This film though...something was definitely missing. The opening felt contrived and forced. It was overly dark and it made me feel like Zack knew he was skimping on the opening so he tried like hell to make the film dark to get the despair of the characters across. It didn't work at all and in the end, I didn't really care about what happened to them. While the visuals are nice at times, I felt like I was being bombarded with constant visual assault. I understand Zach has a certain style that he goes for, but it felt as if he just kept layering it on over and over to the point where I stopped watching the film at several times (I actually watched the extended version of the film over a 5 day span, constantly stopping it out of boredom and annoyance). As previously mentioned, the sound isn't all that great. I absolutely hate it when the dialog in films is kept at an unnecessarily low level. While characters were speaking in this film, I was constantly having to raise the volume so I could hear them. Then as soon as an action scene kicked in I had to lower it or be overpowered by gunfire and blasting music.Regardless of the sound issue, Zach did pick some good music for the film. I instantly recognized Bjork's Army of Me which I've owned on CD for several years (was on the soundtrack for the film Tank Girl). It was nice to see Carla Gugino in another one of his films. I liked her performance as Silk Spectre. She did a good job here as well. The rest of the previously named actresses could probably carry their own films without a problem. Unfortunately, I felt their talents were underutilized in this movie. Abbie Cornish in particular had a great performance in the film Bright Star. I knew this being an action film we wouldn't see the same performance from her, but I felt bad knowing that with all her talent she was held in place by a hollow and boring character.I'm also a little happy for them as they were able to let go of their more serious roles and just cut loose and kick some butt in this movie. It was nice to see them all having a good time with the sword and gun play. I think the overbearing visual effects hurt their good time though as they are constantly tugging at your eyes when you should be paying attention to the characters.Overall, this film for me was a snoozer. I just got bored with it so many times that I almost didn't finish it. I'd seen it in stores for a few weeks, but never picked it up as I'd read some bad reviews. When I saw that it was under $8, I thought what the hell. I'll give it a look. I can see why there were so many bad reviews though. I won't say the film is trash because it does provide a little fun if you have a couple of hours to spare. If you like a movie with some depth and a solid story though, you may want to look elsewhere.2.5 / 5",3,A Visual Assault with a Lackluster Story,1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,3350,"['Format', 'Blu', 'RayPros', 'Got', 'three', 'disc', 'edition', '8Came', 'free', 'comicAbbie', 'Cornish', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'Jenna', 'Malone', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'are', 'great', 'actressesThe', 'music', 'selection', 'very', 'goodCons', 'Empty', 'storyOverly', 'darkPoor', 'use', 'high', 'caliber', 'starsVery', 'Grainy', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'transfer5.1', 'sound', 'awful', 'constantly', 'having', 'raise', 'lower', 'volumeWith', 'cast', 'was', 'hoping', 'better', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'work', 'loved', 'Watchmen', 'Man', 'Steel', 'looks', 'promising', 'going', 'see', 'few', 'days', 'film', 'something', 'was', 'definitely', 'missing', 'opening', 'felt', 'contrived', 'forced', 'was', 'overly', 'dark', 'made', 'feel', 'Zack', 'knew', 'was', 'skimping', 'opening', 'so', 'tried', 'hell', 'make', 'film', 'dark', 'get', 'despair', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'visuals', 'are', 'nice', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'bombarded', 'constant', 'visual', 'assault', 'understand', 'Zach', 'certain', 'style', 'felt', 'just', 'kept', 'layering', 'point', 'where', 'stopped', 'watching', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'actually', 'watched', 'extended', 'version', 'film', '5', 'day', 'span', 'constantly', 'stopping', 'boredom', 'annoyance', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'sound', ""n't"", 'great', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'when', 'dialog', 'films', 'kept', 'unnecessarily', 'low', 'level', 'characters', 'were', 'speaking', 'film', 'was', 'constantly', 'having', 'raise', 'volume', 'could', 'hear', 'Then', 'as', 'soon', 'action', 'scene', 'kicked', 'had', 'lower', 'be', 'overpowered', 'gunfire', 'blasting', 'music.Regardless', 'sound', 'issue', 'Zach', 'did', 'pick', 'good', 'music', 'film', 'instantly', 'recognized', 'Bjork', 'Army', 'Me', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'CD', 'several', 'years', 'was', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'Tank', 'Girl', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'one', 'films', 'liked', 'performance', 'Silk', 'Spectre', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'previously', 'named', 'actresses', 'could', 'probably', 'carry', 'own', 'films', 'problem', 'Unfortunately', 'felt', 'talents', 'were', 'underutilized', 'movie', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'particular', 'had', 'great', 'performance', 'film', 'Bright', 'Star', 'knew', 'being', 'action', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'same', 'performance', 'felt', 'bad', 'knowing', 'talent', 'was', 'held', 'place', 'hollow', 'boring', 'character.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'little', 'happy', 'were', 'able', 'let', 'go', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'just', 'cut', 'loose', 'kick', 'butt', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'sword', 'gun', 'play', 'think', 'overbearing', 'visual', 'effects', 'hurt', 'good', 'time', 'are', 'constantly', 'tugging', 'eyes', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'paying', 'attention', 'characters.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'snoozer', 'just', 'got', 'bored', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', ""'d"", 'seen', 'stores', 'few', 'weeks', 'never', 'picked', 'up', ""'d"", 'read', 'bad', 'reviews', 'When', 'saw', 'was', '8', 'thought', 'what', 'hell', ""'ll"", 'give', 'look', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'reviews', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'trash', 'provide', 'little', 'fun', 'have', 'couple', 'hours', 'spare', 'like', 'movie', 'depth', 'solid', 'story', 'may', 'want', 'look', 'elsewhere.2.5', '/', '5']",Sucker Punch

There were a handful of dissenters, notably Betsy Sharkey of the LA Times, who said she wouldn't have missed it for the world, but there always are a few eccentric responses to anything. So, when the DVD slid into the player last night I fully expected momentarily to go screaming from the room in agony because fumbling for the remote would take too long. I didn't.Did the mainstream critics and I see the same movie? Many of the reviews were written by people I respect and with whom I usually agree. I don't agree this time. I saw the same movie Betsy did and I'm with her. Yes, of course this film exploits adolescent fantasies. I don't think the trailers hid that aspect. Do we need to list the many highly regarded movies that play to adolescent fantasies?Basic plot: wrongfully committed to a high security asylum by a corrupt stepfather, ""Baby Doll"" seeks freedom while indulging in two layers of fantasy.Just go with the flow of this surreal and beautifully filmed movie. It does make sense in its own dark way. It's true that video game references are not original to this film (see Scott Pilgrim as one example), but this movie handles them well. The heroine's journey is not a warm and fuzzy one.  It won't leave you feeling cheerful inside. But I didn't leave the room.Clearly a lot of people truly hate this movie, and I can't guarantee you won't be one of them.

It started off bad, but once I finished, I found myself pleased with the movie and surprisingly good enough to buy.The storyline while a little confusing at first, actually attracted my interest. It isn't completly original in the main goal, but the development of the characters, what Babydoll's visions were, the paralleling of the dream sequences to real events kept me watching. I found myself caring for the characters and felt sad when things turned out bad for them.Now the ending I liked but it has a missing scene that is extremely helpful. Babydoll is told she needs ""Map, Fire, Knife, Lock and the reason"", well the theatrical cut, does not have the scene where she finds the reason. She does sort of say she figures it out, but it isn't enough for most viewers. Go to youtube and look up Sucker Punch uncut ending it's about 7 minutes. It's a pity studios decided to cut that scene out as it properly concludes the story.Now why three stars? Purely becuase this movie is more of an eye candy film then Snyder's other movies, only a select few will appreciate the film and its messages and unlike Source Code (which is similer in terms of making you think and being powerful yet simple) the ending can easily be misinterpreted.

Ultimately I believe the film is about empowerment and how we are all born with the weapons needed to empower ourselves to take action. The message is delivered in two very stylized worlds which may be where the problem seem to have is. One world is more like Moulin Rouge with bright colors and musical numbers. The other is a gold colored world of kick ass action sequences set in varying geek-bate locals. Maybe I liked the film more than most because I like action movies as well as musicals.

Ok that said lets get to the un-explained:1) The Dance the female lead in the movie does this dance that makes people just focus only on her they are aware of nothing going on around them. What is this dance we have no idea we never get to see anymore then her swaying back and forth for a few seconds.2) The fight scenes at first she is alone in them then in the second fight scene she is joined with others how is that are they danceing also are they aware of the fight scene?3) we have all watched movies where part of it takes place in a dream world but now we have a movie where the dream world has a dream world.4) The core story that started the movie what happen to it.

1401166,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B004EPYZU8,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[2, 6]","Not much of a story, but fun to watch, nonetheless:This film possesses the elements I generally look for in a film.  Gorgeous girls, and in this case, hot young girls dressed in scantily clad fighting gear and even just tangible scraps of clothing that could pass for military uniforms.  They did quite well at keeping it all ""sexy-looking.""  And I like cool, dark world visuals.  So, babes and dark dystopian landscapes are two strong elements I seek in a film.  Sometimes, I really don't care if there is little to no real story.  This film is basically ALL about eye-candy!After I've watched this, I try to look at this film as how the original concept was perceived.  I have to think that somebody who's really creative at fabricating graphic, very detailed, dark worlds and over-the-top fighting scenes in these fantasy worlds, had concocted a few pre-conceived five minute visuals designed by computer graphics (of course) and then they had to figure out how to write a story to put these various unrelated fantasy scenes together to make a movie somehow.As a story, this was really lame.  Very empty.  Directionless. This could not possibly be an interesting book, even if they included a few pictures.  So, that alone, should tell you that there is no real story here.  Just great artwork brought to life.  And there is nothing wrong with that.  I like films that have cool visuals, and this film has many.Parents should have no problem allowing their children (even as young as 10) to watch this film.  There are no real bloody scenes, and no fowl language.  I respect the makers of this film for making this film a treat for a family audience of all ages.I noticed in the movie trailer that they used Led Zeppelin's ""When the Levee Breaks"" as background music.  Perhaps that was to attract an older audience.  Well, that did capture my interest, for sure.  But, in the movie, they used Bjork's ""Army of Me"" which has a similar rhythm and beat.  But, that song is cool too.Yeah, I'll get the Blu-Ray when this film comes available for release.  It makes for a great background movie to have on, whether I choose to actually sit down and watch it, or not.If you like ""babefest"" films with girls fighting, check out ""D.O.A. Dead or Alive"", and ""B!tch Slap.""  Other good ""babefest"" films are ""D.E.B.S."", ""Chasing Papi"", ""Man of the House"", ""Bride and Prejudice"" (the semi-Bollywood version with Aishwarya Rai and Namrata Shiradkar), ""Cloud 9"", ""So Close"" and even the Japanese Criterion Collection masterpiece of Seijun Suzuki's ""Gate of Flesh.""I don't buy a lot of new movies these days.  Hardly any. Semi-stimulating stories are diminishing.  Dramas are directed more towards the female audience anymore, so all that's left for me to enjoy in any new film is if it looks cool on the screen, and if it is not too offensive.  I don't need blood, guts, and gore to be entertained.  And today's idea of comedy, is just too stupid.  Comedies today try too hard to be funny and so it fails to be, to me.  The situation comedy of film seems to have faded away, these days.  Making parodies of past films seems to be the goal of today's comedies, and it all just stinks.But, with all that said, this quirky film, with the girls, and the graphic detailed artwork, apparently works for me.  It was a good time for me at the theatre when I went with my girl.

1401177,A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,B004EPYZU8,Senor Zoidbergo,"[426, 461]","The extended cut of Sucker Punch adds approximately 17 minutes and 45 seconds of additional footage, and is R-rated.  The extended cut is much darker than the theatrical cut; while not necessarily being more visually explicit, previously implied suggestions are now explicitly overt.  The violence and action scenes have also been extended as well, with two re-inserted battle sequences, one with the orcs at the castle (arterial spurts of green orc blood), and the other with the German World War I zombies.I don't think I quite understand Snyder's multi-layered metaphorical comparisons between the brothel, asylum, and Baby Doll's fantasy worlds, but I will say that the movie (especially the action sequences) are visually stunning, and the colors beautifully contrasted.  Credit especially to the actresses for their proficient firearms handling (but where exactly did they store all those extra magazines I wonder?).  However, it would be superficial to suggest that Sucker Punch is only about girls in anime costumes fighting monsters in fantasy worlds, though that is certainly an interpretation shared by many critics who panned the movie.Here are the main differences between the Extended Cut and Theatrical Cut; NOTE, SPOILERS FOLLOW, so continue reading at your own risk.(1) Baby Doll shoots at the stepfather a second time (as compared to a single time in the theatrical cut), resulting in some CG blood and an arm bullet wound, which the stepfather grabs at.(2) When Sweet Pea first meets Baby Doll (with Blue and the priest), Sweet Pea says, ""the priest brought you here from the orphanage to lose your virginity, right?"".  Then Blue says, ""The High Roller is coming in 5 days to do a little flower picking..""  There is no such comment about deflowering in the theatrical cut.(3) Rocket takes Baby Doll on an extended tour of the nightclub, showing her a backstage area where clients are not allowed.  She shows Baby Doll the cleaning closet where new girls are assigned cleaning duties.  They pass by the kitchen where the chef makes a lewd face at the girls, who ignore him, and walk onwards.(4) Full dance number of ""Love is a Drug"" as performed by Blue & Vera.  It's quite extravagant.(5) The cook attacks Rocket more violently and physically in the extended cut.(6) The backstage scene where Baby Doll explains her plans is extended.  Vera writes the order of the dancers, with Sweet Pea performing first.  Rocket and Sweet Pea then sit down, and Sweet Pea tells Rocket that she won't help Baby Doll.(7) In the World War I scene, the Wiseman briefs the girls for a little longer.  The map they are to capture is a map of the trenches and troop locations, the map will be sent via courier by zeppelin.  The Wiseman then asks Amber how she likes the mech, to which Amber replies in the affirmative.  The Extended Cut includes a great shot of the girls slowly walking out of the fog into no man's land, and additional shots of zombie German troops rushing out of their respective trenches.  Amber shoots down several attack German fighters before herself flying skyward, and Blondie grabs her Daewoo K3 and mows down a horde of attacking zombies, littering the battlefield with their corpses.  There is additional hand-to-hand and (hatchet-to-bayonet vis a vis Blondie) combat in the trenches, and Baby Doll fights the Zombie commander initially in an extended sword fight.  I'm glad they extended the WWI sequence, it looks fantastic.(8) Vera tries to cheer up Baby Doll pre-performance with a quote by Mark Twain about illusions.(9) The orc/castle/knight siege scene has been heavily extended, most prominently featuring a new scene of the girls jumping into the courtyard, and decimating the orcs using firearms and edged weapons, while performing various acrobatic maneuvers.  Green orc blood spray across the screen.  Additional shot of knights trying to break through the gate with a tree trunk.  Extended combat scene of girls versus knights, and slow-motion scene of Blondie firing the side machine gun.(10) Blue tells Baby Doll that he will ""pop that smile right off of her face"", whereas in the theatrical cut, he falters without completing the sentence.(11) The sequence where Amber is killed shows Blue's gun being fired twice, rather than the slight vibration in the wine glass.  Blue shoots Blondie when she's on the ground an additional time.  Nothing graphic is shown.(12) Blue attacks Baby Doll for a longer period of time (and more physically) in the extended cut, when backstage.(13)  After Baby Doll is knocked unconscious, Sweet Pea steals a white dress while on the lam.(14) During the last, infamous scene between the High Roller and Baby Doll, white gloved hands undress Baby Doll down to her skivvies.  High Roller and Baby Doll talk, and High Roller doesn't just want to deflower Baby Doll; rather, he wishes to grant her freedom from everything, in essence, granting her absolution.  Baby Doll seems quite taken and the two begin to kiss passionately, but no nudity is shown.  The Extended Cut directly links Baby Doll's deflowering in the brothel to her lobotomy in the real world; I can understand why this scene was cut to make the PG-13 rating, as it's rather sexually suggestive.",5,Sucker Punch Extended Cut vs. Theatrical Cut Differences,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,5228,"['extended', 'cut', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'approximately', '17', 'minutes', '45', 'seconds',

1401192,AJN24TVEGZEI4,B004EPYZU8,Steve,"[5, 8]","Truthfully, there has been a lot of disdain, complaining and moaning about this movie, but personally, I though it was pretty good, was exceptionally entertaining and was visually stunning.  Additionally, the movie soundtrack was great as the fight scenes were perfectly choreographed to the music and the music was perfectly picked for the fight scenes.  The story line for this movie was pretty good, was intriguing and was very fast paced.  The action and fight scenes were fast, were exciting and kept you wanting more and more.  The ending to this movie was great; it added a nice twist and was not blatantly obvious.  I do have one particular complaint about this movie; basically, the characters were not developed enough.  Even the main character was not developed.  All we know about the main character is that she was sexually abused by her stepfather and that she tried to kill him.. end of story, and even worse we know less about the other girls... Yes, the character development absolutely sucked!  I do wish that the director would have expanded on this more than he did.  I notice a lot of people complaining about the ""misogyny"" and the sexualization of the women... get a grip on reality! Sex and violence sells.. Attractive girls blasting and chopping through hoards of goblins, undead, dragons or anything for that matter will sell and ultimately film is a business and is about what sells most.  Lastly, the addition scenes in the uncut version are great.  Many of the fight scenes were expanded and were made even more stunning, the final scene with the ""High Roller"" was expanded and elaborated, and contained a phenomenal juxtaposition of human sexuality, freedom and human emotionality.The main plot of the movie follows a girl who is abused by her step father and whom she tries to kill.  She is brought to a 1950s era insane asylum.  Throughout the movie the girl disassociates herself from reality by creating intricate fantasies and by ultimately dulling the pain of her reality through visions and fantasies of self empowerment.  In essence the girls who she is locked up with, plan an escape from the asylum but they need to obtain 5 hard to get items to do it.  The end provides a real twist and adds a third layer to the ultimate plot.  I dont want to expand any further than this in risk of ruining the charm of the movie.Many of the persons who underrated this movie complained about plot holes and the like, and how shallow the movie was.. I think that there was quite a bit going on, and that ultimately the movie was more than a comic book movie, but instead was a post-modern expansion of how the human mind deals with pain and psychological stressors by disassociating themselves from them and by creating fantasy worlds to live in.. Truthfully, this is not farfetched; I would say it was a pretty accurate portrayal of this type of behavior.I think that you should definitely check this movie out as it was very well thought out and was very well done.

1401194,A8LFXWE1VZ94A,B004EPYZU8,SylvesterFox007,"[3, 8]","""Sucker Punch"" is gorgeous.  And I'm not just talking about its quintet of leading ladies, who are all undeniably attractive.  Every shot of the movie is absolutely drool-worthy.It's no ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Casablanca.""  But who expects it to be?  Anyone familiar with director Zack Snyder's previous films (the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""300"", ""Watchmen"") or anyone who's seen a trailer of the movie, should know exactly what to expect.It's hard to describe the plot because there's plenty open to interpretation.  The movie follows a girl, played by Emily Browning, known to the audience mostly as ""Babydoll.""  Locked away in an insane asylum, she and/or the other girl(s) cope with reality by retreating into one or more levels of fantasy.  Now's not the place to get into my interpretation of the plot.  Suffice it to say the ""story"", while being a little bit deeper than what you'd expect from your typical action flick, is still just a line to hang jaw-dropping action scenes on.As Snyder's first completely original screenplay, ""Sucker Punch"" is exactly what you would expect from the imagination of the man who directed ""Watchmen"".  Almost every male fantasy conceivable is brought to life on screen, from the beautiful women (obviously), to samurai swords, epic fantasy and science fiction landscapes, heavy artillery, evil robots, and more.  Snyder doesn't exactly have a flare for dialogue, and some of the lines feel clunky.  So, thankfully, not much talking is done.  The dramatic opening sequence, after a little bit of narration, is silent except for a cinematic cover of ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"", telling the audience everything they need to know through action and the actor's expressions.  Similarly, not much talking gets done during the movie's big action set pieces, definitely the highlights of the film.As with Snyder's other films, it's easy to compare the way certain scenes are shot to a video game or a music video.  The soundtrack is perfect, incorporating covers of classic and modern rock songs perfect for each scene they accompany, including some performed by Emily Browning herself in an enchanting, haunting voice.  Even the incidental music adds to the movie's excitement.Being a movie with five major characters that's less than two hours long, not all of the characters feel fully developed.  Jena Malone as ""Rocket"" delivers the best acting performance, sharing most of the movie's dramatic scenes with Abbie Cornish as ""Sweet Pea.""  Vanessa Hudgens as ""Blondie"" actually does surprisingly well during the action scenes, but her voice still seems too sweet for this kind of role, and she's not going to help audience forget she's a graduate of ""High School Musical"" anytime soon.  Emily Browning does a fine job with the leading role, conveying more through her big eyes and pouty lips than any of her lines.  Jamie Chung as ""Amber"", personally my favorite character, sadly gets very little screen time.  As far as supporting performances go, Carla Gugino delivers yet another solid acting job, Jon Hamm adds a touch of class, and Scott Glenn intrigues as the mysterious, homespun wisdom spurning ""Wiseman.""  Oscar Isaac is noteworthy as a nasty who doesn't seem like a typical Hollywood villain but an all-too-real sleaze ball audiences should love to loathe.But for the most part, dialogue and story aren't Zack Snyder's strong suits.  The CGI is breathtaking, the action choreography's plenty of fun, the girls all look great, and the cinematography is a feast for the eyes.  And not just during action scenes.  Each time the camera panned around the murky corners of the asylum, I found myself turning my head to try to see what was coming.  ""Sucker Punch"" may not be for everyone, but it delivers everything the marketing promises.  It's a visual feast with a script that, while not sensational, manages to be just good enough to stay out of the way.",5,Visually Gorgeous,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,3904,"['Sucker', 'Punch', 'gorgeous', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'quintet', 'leading', 'ladies', 'who', 'are', 'undeniably', 'attractive', 'shot', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'drool-worthy.It', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Casablanca', 'who', 'be', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'director', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'previous', 'films', 'remake', 'Dawn', 'Dead', '300', 'Watchmen', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'trailer', 'movie', 'should', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect.It', 'hard', 'describe', 'plot', 'plenty', 'open', 'interpretation', 'movie', 'girl', 'played', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'known', 'audience', 'mostly', 'Babydoll', 'Locked', 'away', 'insane', 'asylum', 'and/or', 'other', 'girl', 'cope', 'reality', 'retreating', 'one', 'more', 'levels', 'fantasy', 'Now', 'not', 'place', 'get', 'interpretation', 'plot', 'Suffice', 'say', 'story', 'being', 'little', 'bit', 'deeper', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'typical', 'action', 'flick', 'still', 'just', 'line', 'hang', 'jaw-dropping', 'action', 'scenes', 'Snyder', 'first', 'completely', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'imagination', 'man', 'who', 'directed', 'Watchmen', 'Almost', 'male', 'fantasy', 'conceivable', 'brought', 'life', 'screen', 'beautiful', 'women', 'obviously', 'samurai', 'swords', 'epic', 'fantasy', 'science', 'fiction', 'landscapes', 'heavy', 'artillery', 'evil', 'robots', 'more', 'Snyder', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'flare', 'dialogue', 'lines', 'feel', 'clunky', 'So', 'thankfully', 'not', 'much', 'talking', 'done', 'dramatic', 'opening', 'sequence', 'little', 'bit', 'narration', 'silent', 'cinematic', 'cover', 'Sweet', 'Dreams', 'Are', 'Made', 'telling', 'audience', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'action', 'actor', 'expressions', 'Similarly', 'not', 'much', 'talking', 'done', 'movie', 'big', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'definitely', 'highlights', 'film.As', 'Snyder', 'other', 'films', 'easy', 'compare', 'way', 'certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'video', 'game', 'music', 'video', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'incorporating', 'covers', 'classic', 'modern', 'rock', 'songs', 'perfect', 'scene', 'accompany', 'including', 'performed', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'enchanting', 'haunting', 'voice', 'Even', 'incidental', 'music', 'movie', 'excitement.Being', 'movie', 'five', 'major', 'characters', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'not', 'characters', 'feel', 'fully', 'developed', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Rocket', 'best', 'acting', 'performance', 'sharing', 'most', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'Sweet', 'Pea', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'Blondie', 'actually', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'action', 'scenes', 'voice', 'still', 'too', 'sweet', 'kind', 'role', 'not', 'going', 'help', 'audience', 'forget', 'graduate', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'anytime', 'soon', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'fine', 'job', 'leading', 'role', 'conveying', 'more', 'big', 'eyes', 'pouty', 'lips', 'lines', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'Amber', 'personally', 'favorite', 'character', 'sadly', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'As', 'far', 'supporting', 'performances', 'go', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'yet', 'solid', 'acting', 'job', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'touch', 'class', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'mysterious', 'homespun', 'wisdom', 'spurning', 'Wiseman', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'noteworthy', 'nasty', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'villain', 'all-too-real', 'sleaze', 'ball', 'audiences', 'should', 'love', 'loathe.But', 'most', 'part', 'dialogue', 'story', 'are', ""n't"", 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'strong', 'suits', 'CGI', 'breathtaking', 'action', 'choreography', 'plenty', 'fun', 'girls', 'look', 'great', 'cinematography', 'feast', 'eyes', 'not', 'just', 'action', 'scenes', 'time', 'camera', 'panned', 'murky', 'corners', 'asylum', 'found', 'turning', 'head', 'try', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'everything', 'marketing', 'promises', 'visual', 'feast', 'script', 'not', 'sensational', 'be', 'just', 'good', 'enough', 'stay', 'way']",Sucker Punch

I didn't like the ending as they attempted to make a statement when none was needed. Baby Doll's mother dies. The step-dad was left out of the will so he kills Baby doll's sister and blames her during a goth version of ""Sweet Dreams"" (Annie Lennox). Baby Doll is committed to the Lennox asylum in Brattleboro, Vt. She is supposed to get a lobotomy in 5 days, during which she plans an escape.The asylum has a stage where the girls perform. Baby Doll has a dance which mesmerizes people, a dance, we the audience never get to see. While Baby Doll dances she goes into a trance or dream world where she imagines she is battling all kinds of creatures (zombies, orcs etc). This is all done to a great soundtrack and computer graphics. In this aspect, the movie reminded me of ""Heavy Metal"", a series of stories loosely connected by a plot. This actually works well, unfortunately when the movie deviates from it, it doesn't work at all. During the first dance Baby Doll is told to get certain objects so she can escape. During her subsequent dances she entrances the males in the audience while her fellow inmates steal the item they need. The item they steal relates to the surreal imagination of Baby Doll.No nudity, no sex, and the language was acceptable. Girls run around in short skirts with tight black hip boots.

I was so hyped that I even totally disregarded the negative reviews it generated right after its launch. I should have listened to IMDB.It is OK to have a movie mainly based on action and violence. We need to vent off the anger of living in this world somehow. But even when we are hellbent on seeing things explode and people and creatures get slaughtered, in the back of our minds; deep inside a small crevice we also desire to see some coherence; some connection to the hero and some immerison in what's going on in the silver screen.Unfortunately, Sucker Punch is just a hollow punch.

1401210,A2J9COKR9JAZUQ,B004EPYZU8,"Trey David Wood ""The Sleeper Must Awaken""","[2, 2]","Every so often a movie comes along that gains a poor reputation for no apparent reason.  It becomes the target of unfairly harsh criticisms on the part of cynical mobs of professional and ""armchair"" critics alike.  Such a movie is Sucker Punch, one of the most visually dazzlingly and narratively experimental action/fantasy movies of all time.Let me begin by pointing out its only real flaw:  It isn't long enough for the story; which means there isn't enough time to fully establish its group of femme fatales. Even after seeing the much better extended version, I still feel like the characters needed more ""down time"" to breathe and interact between the insane action vignettes that are its main attraction.  The theatrical version seems stiff and remote because of this, although it is significantly improved by the extra footage in the extended version-- just not as much as you would want. I think Sucker Punch would be stronger overall if each of the five main girls were fleshed out (not a pun) a little more.  Perhaps as little as ten extra minutes of characterization would have helped.  Anyway, that is my only legitimate gripe.  Stay tuned for a comically illegitimate one later on.As you might imagine, the visuals in the movie are awesome.  That is at least one thing the movie's detractors will allow it: it looks and sounds amazing.  The battles are well-staged and exciting, and I find it hard to imagine that anyone could not be entertained by watching these particular scenes.If you are confused about the nature of these scenes because you have seen video clips here and there of giant samurais, machine guns,  World War II planes, dragons, etc.  then I have a simple explanation:  each of these scenes is an metaphor.  That's it.  They aren't dreams or visions,  just wildly imaginative metaphors for each stage of the girls' struggle to escape from the asylum they are forced to live in. Some people find this difficult to understand.  It isn't.Now, I will address one more thing before I close.  There have been charges that the movie is chauvinistic and degrading toward women, that the girls are dressed scantily all the time, that the movie panders to drooling neanderthals who only want to see T&A;, etc.  Well, fortunately (and unfortunately), this is not the case.  During the action vignettes, the girls are dressed only mildly inappropriately for the conditions of the fight-- by which I mean, you might see a bit of thigh or midriff, but they aren't wearing chain mail bikinis ala Red Sonja.  Their fight-scene garb should not raise any eyebrows.  During the ""real"" part of the story, which I forgot to add is the first layer of metaphor that blankets most of the movie, the girls are metaphorically in a 1920's style club where they have to entertain the rich and significant.  Well, not much of the movie actually deals with their interactions with patrons, or their dancing for that matter, so you still end up not seeing that much T&A; even when logically you would expect to see a fair amount of it.  So, the movie under-delivers on this score and yet is unfairly said to contain too much of it.  There is no nudity in the entire movie, I might add.  Sucker Punch has a solid R rating, but only because of stylized violence and language.  Sin City has quite a bit of nudity and scantily dressed vixens, yet this is generally not counted against it in reviews.  Anyway,  as I was mentioning earlier about a comically illegitimate complaint, it is only that given the R rating and the fact that you have five dazzling girls as leads in a shady dance club, it is oddly disappointing that you never do see anything truly tantalizing.  Yes, I know, silly of me to mention it, but I'm sure someone was wondering.In closing, I think Sucker Punch is a really entertaining and innovative action-fantasy movie and deserves far better treatment that it has received thus far.

Though I like ""Love Actually,"" the lengthy romantic comedy would have been much better with a director other than Richard Curtis. There are also some creative directors who shouldn't write. Visually dazzling as it may be, ""Sucker Punch,"" for which director Zack Snyder himself wrote the original story, needs a better writer.After the film's introduction that tells the back story of a young girl nicknamed ""Baby Doll"" (Emily Brown), we are ushered into the Lennox House, a mental asylum where Baby Doll is locked up by her abusive step-father and will have to undergo a lobotomy surgery. There, as a way to escape from the grim reality, Baby Doll creates a fantasy world of her own, where she and four other heroine (or ""dancers"") - Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone) and Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) - will fight the WWI German zombie soldiers and dragons.The screenplay by Zack Snyder and Steve Shibuya looks like a whimsical assortment of ideas they came up with brainstorming. It does not even try to explain why Baby Doll has to fight three giant samurai in Japanese temple. Scott Glenn shows up as The Wise Man, telling her to collect five items to be free, and that's all. Well, I really don't care these things as long as the film offers some creative and original ideas, which it fails to do.Let's face it. For all nice costumes of the heroines, most things you see in the noisy CGI-heavy battles are derivative. The idea of Baby Doll fighting a giant samurai, which should be given more originality, soon becomes stale with unimaginative combat styles that you saw somewhere before. A bigger problem is that initial excitement fades soon because in the fantasy world (or the ""real"" world) there is no one to root for. The visual extravaganza is like watching someone playing the video game.Clearly the players did a considerable amount of training for the stunt, and you can see that in their fight sequences.

It's a bit difficult to follow at times as it's a somewhat disjointed venture.You've basically got three themes running throughout this picture, and it takes a bit sometimes to see where they're connecting or overlapping.You have reality, which is really pretty dark and not totally logical, an altered/enhanced (dressed up?) reality which is the main theme hooking in the fantasy reality theme.Reality:It's dark and a bit disturbing as I mentioned at the beginning, but it's also not really logical - to me it's really quite a stretch to see how she ends up being committed to an Insane Asylum.Altered Reality:Not quite as dark, but it's presented as a managed brothel where the girls are essentially slaves with no say or way to escape.This brings in the dancing thing, where whenever she dances we hook into the fantasy part which impacts reality/altered reality - I guess her dancing is supposed to hypnotize everyone or something, I don't know.Fantasy:This is what you see in the Trailers, and is the real draw of the movie, with the only drawback being that this girl just suddenly becomes some super uber Martial Arts/Fighter without having any training/exposure to it what so ever - maybe all that was cut on the editing floor, who knows, but it was a disappointment.[Spoiler]The plot in the end, doesn't even end up about her, she's just a vehicle to help someone else escape.In the end she end's up getting an Icepick Lobotomy (without Anesthesia no less) - like they still do those these days, especially after only five days in the Asylum.I wasn't really crazy about the music.A fair amount was some shreds (maybe shredded would be more accurate) of better known songs, where I'm guessing the target audience is more of the Punk scene - just not for me.The two star are primarily for the Fantasy portions of this movie, they were decent, it's just too bad they couldn't have been wrapped into a better package than the overall Movie.I've no doubt this will probably end up with a Cult following, it was too dark and had too many holes for my liking though.",2,Visuals are best selling point (some spoiler).,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,2291,"['saw', 'Trailers', 'noted', 'overall', 'rating', 'here', 'Amazon', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'bad', 'things', ""'d"", 'heard.This', 'somewhat', 'fairly', 'dark/creepy', 'insinuated', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'Movie', 'right', 'start', 'bit', 'difficult', 'follow', 'times', 'somewhat', 'disjointed', 'venture.You', ""'ve"", 'basically', 'got', 'three', 'themes', 'running', 'picture', 'bit', 'sometimes', 'see', 'where', ""'re"", 'connecting', 'overlapping.You', 'have', 'reality', 'really', 'pretty', 'dark', 'not', 'totally', 'logical', 'altered/enhanced', 'dressed', 'up', 'reality', 'main', 'theme', 'hooking', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'theme.Reality', 'dark', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'mentioned', 'beginning', 'also', 'not', 'really', 'logical', 'really', 'quite', 'stretch', 'see', 'how', 'up', 'being', 'committed', 'Insane', 'Asylum.Altered', 'Reality', 'Not', 'quite', 'dark', 'presented', 'managed', 'brothel', 'where', 'girls', 'are', 'essentially', 'slaves', 'say', 'way', 'escape.This', 'brings', 'dancing', 'thing', 'where', 'whenever', 'hook', 'fantasy', 'part', 'reality/altered', 'reality', 'guess', 'dancing', 'supposed', 'hypnotize', 'everyone', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Fantasy', 'what', 'see', 'Trailers', 'real', 'draw', 'movie', 'only', 'drawback', 'being', 'girl', 'just', 'suddenly', 'super', 'uber', 'Martial', 'Arts/Fighter', 'having', 'training/exposure', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'maybe', 'was', 'cut', 'editing', 'floor', 'who', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Spoiler', ']', 'plot', 'end', ""n't"", 'even', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'vehicle', 'help', 'someone', 'else', 'end', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'Icepick', 'Lobotomy', 'Anesthesia', 'no', 'less', 'still', 'do', 'days', 'especially', 'only', 'five', 'days', 'Asylum.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'crazy', 'music.A', 'fair', 'amount', 'was', 'shreds', 'maybe', 'shredded', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'better', 'known', 'songs', 'where', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'target', 'audience', 'more', 'Punk', 'scene', 'just', 'not', 'me.The', 'two', 'star', 'are', 'primarily', 'Fantasy', 'portions', 'movie', 'were', 'decent', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'wrapped', 'better', 'package', 'overall', 'Movie.I', ""'ve"", 'doubt', 'will', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'Cult', 'following', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'holes', 'liking']",Sucker Punch

1401219,A2Z89JF8PR7F1S,B004EPYZU8,"Wearbe ""We got tactical smart-missles, phased...","[4, 6]","We rented Sucker Punch on standard DVD from Redbox today and it was quite an experience.  It was a visual orgy that mixes my AP English Composition teacher's sadism with music videos, Alice in Wonderland, and a JapAnime-Loving teen's wet dream all together into what is basically a 45 minute film, story-wise, that stretches out to almost 2 hours as a result of a handful of metaphorical sequences that have little to do with the story but create opportunities for the Zack Snyder Film Team to show what cutting edge technology and visionaries with keen eyes and healthy imaginations can do for movies.  It was visually striking on my big TV so in Digital 3D on a big theater screen I bet it was breath taking.  While the visuals were fun, the movie DOES actually have more than meets the eye (as far as I can tell since I just finished watching it and have not yet read anything beyond those opening week reviews).There are 4 levels to this movie:1. Reality in a Asylum (1940-1955 era when lobotomies were being performed)2. Drugged reality in the Brothel3. Music-fueled, dancing imagination-wars4. Metaphysical super-reality that includes and transcends 1, 2 & 3In the first level (the 45 minute story part) the movie is about 2 young women.  One experiences a family tragedy which cascades her into the asylum and kicks off the drugged, 2nd level of the movie.  The other woman was already at the asylum and is the key to the development of the metaphysical level of the movie.  It is the intersection of these two women that provides the structure to everything and I think much of the initial poor critical reception that I saw during the first week was probably due to people missing this.The second level kicks off shortly after the arrival at the asylum once the mind-numbing drugs are introduced.  The perceived reality shifts to that of a brothel populated by unwillingly held women and the handful of low-life males who control them. It is in this world that all the relationships are forged and the plans are drawn for escape.  A key component to executing each portion of the plan is the distraction dances that the lead girl does while her accomplices carry out the escape plans behind the backs of the gawking men.The third level, the dancing imagination-wars, is what we are presented with when the distraction dances are done. Rather than watch an actual dance number, the viewer is transported to a visual interpretation of the dancer's emotional and psychological state. The dancing imagination-wars have Lord of the Rings-style castle sieges (complete with orks and dragons), Samurai Giants in Feudal Japan, WWI steam-punk trench warfare, and future-scape iRobot terrorists on floating bullet trains... and the heroines dive into all the battles using modern automatic rifles, swords, knives, and some other small arms that look like they were plucked out of various points in history.  If you have ever dreamed of modern paratroopers dropping in to reinforce Aragorn and Frodo, this is your chance to see just such a lop-sided battle... with the bonus of the cleavage-heavy reinforcements skull stomping while wearing cute mini-skirts.  All this takes place with some pretty decent modern rock music fueling the artistry of it all.  Bjork was one of the featured, which left me scratching my head, but aside from her infamous vocals it worked well enough.The fourth level runs concurrently with everything else that is seen. Taken by itself it is only a few minutes long and everything else in the movie is simply its supporting argument. The Wise Man/Commander/Angel (Scott Glenn) (with the help of the narrator) takes care of telling this portion, laying out the thesis statement in the opening scenes and the closing statement at the end while also physically appearing throughout, tying the whole mess together.I liked this movie for 2 reasons: It was sci-fi, fantasy, gun blasting action with respectably good acting from the hotties AND it fed my brain something to think about on the level of the fun stuff we were agonizing over and writing about back in AP English.  If you hated writing English papers you might not ""get"" this movie enough to appreciate it... or if you hate noisy action flicks, you probably won't get past the gratuitous eye candy and overwhelming audio in order to study the brain food. While it isn't as deep as Watchmen, it is cut from a similar cloth, so I'd wager that Watchmen lovers will enjoy this.My only gripe is that it is a PG-13 movie that deals with very dark themes that are obviously hard-core R. I'm not complaining about the lack of gore or nudity (they wouldn't have improved the movie), but there is no way I'd let my kids see this when they hit 13.  I would have been upset if I had unknowingly taken a young teen to this at a theater.It isn't getting 5 stars because it has low re-watch-ability. It is amazing, beautiful, well executed and thought provoking, but it is a bit like Pan's Labyrinth or Watchmen in that, at its core, it is NOT fun and its darkness does not beckon for a second viewing.  I'll stick to ""Star Wars"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Ella Enchanted"" for multiple viewing movies.4/5 or 8.5/10",4,"A visual orgy mixing an AP English Comp teacher's

I really enjoyed Zach Snyder's 300 and liked parts of Watchmen, and I knew from those films he could be counted on to provide a visually impressive motion picture.  However, this new film really only comes alive in the fantasy sequences.  What happens is that the title character, Baby Doll, is unjustly imprisoned in an insane asylum by an evil stepdad eager to get his hands on her late mom's riches.  It turns out the asylum has a profitable sideline going, a pleasure-for-hire business involving the nubile inmates/ dancers and run by one of the orderlies.  Or I guess that's a level of fantasy in itself, removed from the grubby reality of the actual asylum.  Within that ""private dancer"" / inmate fantasy, Baby Doll has her own fantasy world she retreats into while she's dancing.  In that world, Scott Glenn is a sensei / commander, and after an initial solo battle, Baby Doll is joined by her fellow hot inmates on three ""missions"" that will lead to their escape from the asylum in the higher fantasy plane.  (Yes, shades of Inception in the two layers of fantasy.) One battle involves a fight against steam-powered nazi undead (!), the 2nd against a dragon, and the final, futuristic one against shiny robots protecting a bomb.  The ""missions"" are each quite striking visually (although the first solo battle is only so-so), but the action REALLY DRAGS when events switch back to the asylum.  I found myself wishing the asylum scenes would be over quickly so we could get back to the ""missions.""

Like I said in my title blurb, it is a spectacular production with absolutely stunning women, particularly Abbie Cornish and Emily Browning, and it is entertaining in many ways; unfortunately, the story is only moderately interesting.Browning plays ""Baby Doll"" in the 1950s, whose wicked stepfather takes her to a mental asylum to receive a lobotomy. He wants to shut her up to hide his crimes, of course. She resorts to fantasy to escape her predicament, imagining herself and the other people at the asylum in a mob-owned brothel. When she's forced to dance at the ""brothel"" she withdraws further into wild fantasies involving feudal Japan, World War I German soldiers, a dragon and an assortment of other bizarre imaginations.There's some depth here. The film's not all hot babes in lingerie and CGI-laden action fantasies. But I'll have to watch it a couple of more times to figure it out. The multi-layered nature of the plot -- reality turning to fantasy and then fantasy within fantasy -- is somewhat off-putting and tends to take one out of the story. As it is, the entertainment value is pretty much limited to the women and the outlandish action sequences. The story of the girls trying to get out of the brothel or asylum is only mildly compelling. Still, it's not bad and I may upgrade my rating after future viewings.The film runs 110 minutes and the extended cut 127 minutes (I own the shorter version and that's more than enough for me).GRADE: C+ or B- (but the women are a definite A+)",3,"Spectacular production and women, but so-so story",1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,1581,"[""'ve"", 'seen', '2011', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'twice', 'now', 'struck', 'same', 'times', 'said', 'title', 'blurb', 'spectacular', 'production', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'women', 'particularly', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'entertaining', 'many', 'ways', 'unfortunately', 'story', 'only', 'moderately', 'interesting.Browning', 'plays', 'Baby', 'Doll', '1950s', 'wicked', 'stepfather', 'mental', 'asylum', 'receive', 'lobotomy', 'shut', 'up', 'hide', 'crimes', 'course', 'fantasy', 'escape', 'predicament', 'imagining', 'other', 'people', 'asylum', 'mob-owned', 'brothel', 'When', 'forced', 'dance', 'brothel', 'further', 'wild', 'fantasies', 'involving', 'feudal', 'Japan', 'World', 'War', 'German', 'soldiers', 'dragon', 'assortment', 'other', 'bizarre', 'depth', 'here', 'film', 'not', 'hot', 'babes', 'lingerie', 'CGI-laden', 'action', 'fantasies', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'couple', 'more', 'times', 'figure', 'out', 'multi-layered', 'nature', 'plot', 'reality', 'turning', 'fantasy', 'then', 'fantasy', 'fantasy', 'somewhat', 'off-putting', 'take', 'one', 'story', 'entertainment', 'value', 'pretty', 'much', 'limited', 'women', 'outlandish', 'action', 'sequences', 'story', 'girls', 'trying', 'get', 'brothel', 'asylum', 'only', 'mildly', 'compelling', 'Still', 'not', 'bad', 'may', 'upgrade', 'rating', 'future', 'viewings.The', 'film', '110', 'minutes', 'extended', 'cut', '127', 'minutes', 'own', 'shorter', 'version', 'more', 'enough', '.GRADE', 'C+', 'B-', 'women', 'are', 'definite', 'A+']",Sucker Punch

Now I have clear picture and clear sound, I find it near-impossible to dislike it. Sure, in some ways it's absurd and I'm guessing some male critics were afraid to admit they liked it because of all the skimpy clothing, but I have to admire Zack Snyder's boldness. (It's interesting that two of the three most favorable reviews were written by women. Maybe they enjoyed seeing women kill the villains without a lot of help from men and without having to be ornaments for heroes???)""SP"" is demented, delirious, and sometimes delightful.When she tries to prevent her stepfather from raping her sister, a young woman accidentally kills that sister. The loathsome stepfather eventually has her committed to a mental institution where she's about to receive a lobotomy when.... she enters a dream world wherein she works in a brothel. What happens there is near-indescribable. But it gets a bit loud at times.I can understand all the objections to this movie. I just can't hate it. Much of it I'm really enjoying. (I'm half through it.)I'm not much of a fan of action movies and some of the battle scenes in this seem too long but they're so over-the-top I almost have to admire them.I'm curious to see if this sells a lot of DVDs and/or becomes a cult favorite.Here's a little oddity: I removed the paper sleeve so I could scan it for a review and I discovered there's artwork on the (usually white) INSIDE of the sleeve. Plus the art features the person who is the film's true protagonist. Snyder gives a hint or two very early about whom the story really centers, then he spends the rest of the movie throwing you curves. I wonder if that major mystery is solved more clearly in the extended version??? Did Warner Brothers insist on cuts that muddied the story and helped sink the movie at the box office? Blast! Now I want to buy the extended version!************************************* UPDATE: 16 Dec 2011 ***********************I don't have a Blu-Ray player but I saw this set for only $10 including shipping.
