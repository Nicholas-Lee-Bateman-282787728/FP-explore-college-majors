The only catch is they have to dance with the single women on board.  Herb, the one who doesn't even want to be there, is the only one of the two that takes this job seriously, and in the process falls for Vivian (Gloria De Haven), a recently widowed woman who's tagged along with her daughter on her honeymoon.  Charlie on the other hand has his eye on the younger, wealthier Liz (Dyan Cannon).  All the while their plans of romance are thrown off by the high-strung cruise director Gil Godwyn (Brent Spiner) who's vying for a promotion.

It begins at a race track where Walter Matthau is betting on horses ... he loses the first race. He stakes his money on a long shot and collects about $3,000.00. Then an Italian ""loan shark"" meets up with him and collects part of the $5,000 loan he gave Walter. Walter visits his pal, Jack Lemon, his brother-in-law, who is celebrating his wedding anniversary ... alone, while talking to a photo of his deceased wife. Walter goes to Jack's closet to borrow a suit and proposes how they can go on a Caribbean cruise ... without paying a dime.Walter and Jack embark on a Caribbean cruise on the Holland America Ship, Westerdaam. They participatge in a ""bon voyage"" champagne party to meet some wealthy ladies ... Jack makes small talk with a lovely mature lady, the first who has caught his eye since his wife died. Meanwhile Walter eyes the wealthy ones ... Walter leads Jack to the upper class suites, where they plan to unpack that is ... until the cabin steward leads Dyan Cannon and her mother to the room. Both Walter Matthau and Jack Lemon go to their lower deck cabin. Later, they 'suit up' to become ""dance hosts"" which is how they earn their free cruise. They meet Brent Spiner, the ambitious Cruise Director, whose management style is 'total control' as he aims to influence Rue Mchalanahan (owner of the ship) to advance his career.As luck would have it, Walter Matthau selects Rue as his dance partner, and shows her moves with his feet and hands like no other dance host on board ... the other dance hosts stare in awe and amazement, as the Cruise Director seithes with anger, while alter essentially paws his dance partner during dips and twirls. She is thrilled with the experience to the chagrin of the Cruise Director ... Walter manages to feign a foot injury, and gets into a card game with Wall Street businessmen. He wins a few hands of poker and receives an $18,000.00 check from the loser, impressing Dyan Cannon, who appears to be wealthy young woman but is a ""gold digger"" ... looking to find a ""sugar daddy"".Afterwards, Walter separates Dyan away from the Wall Street mogul and he escorts her on a land tour in Mexico. The Cruise Director follows him,  trying to prove he faked injury and thereby make him pay for the cruise, at double cost. The chase is on ... with marvelous scenes including a plane ride by the lady passengers, whom Walter and Jack are trying to win over. Needless to say, using clever ploys each man wins the lady of his dreams. Brent Spiner is tricked into ""performing"" in ways he never imagined, to influence Rue to select him for career advancement.

They are amusing and seem to be able to sense how to react together without having to think about. That quality is present in ""Out to Sea"" but it is not enough to carry the weight of the entire film.The premise is one of two elderly genltemen without wives. One is a batchelor and schemer and the other is a widower who is straight laced. Neither are what could be called wealthy. The schemer cons his friend (and former brother in law) into taking a cruise. The htich is that he has signed them up to work as professional dance partners to dance with the ladies. When this comes to light, Mr. Straight hits the ceiling and is ready to leave. Unfortunately the ship has already left and he is stuck working or paying a huge bill. The schemer has a reason for his deception, however. He is looking to get a wealthy wife. His friend has no such ambitions.The plot is one with much potential for comedy. Indeed, there are plenty of moments for smiles and laughs. So too are there more tender moments that can tug at the heartstrings. The problem is that it just doesn't hold together was well as it could.

Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon star as a pair of friends who go to sea as Gentlemen Escorts to find new romance. In essence they are free dance partners for the many single woman on board.Jack promptly falls for Vivian (Gloria DeHaven) as a true romance, while Walter Matthau schemes to seduce a younger woman (Dyan Cannon) who appears wealthy and single. The ship is the Holland Westerdam, an actual luxury cruise ship. You get to see a lot of scenes on the ship - from the pool area, the restaurant, the ballroom and the deck.I really loved the smaller parts played by Hal Linden and especially Brent Spiner. The ""Data"" from Star Trek really shines here as the commanding cruise director.What makes the movie so special is that, in its release year of 1997, you had Lemmon being 71 years old, and Matthau being 77. The two men are still great actors. It gives you a great sense of how vibrant old age can be, if you keep your mind and body healthy. Sadly, both have since passed away, so this movie is a collector's item.What was even more surprising to me is how young Dyan Cannon looks. I loved her in Deathtrap, and while I watched this movie I thought she was a great actress but way too young for the Matthau character. I kept thinking of him as a cradle robber. Actually, she was born in 1937 - so she was 50 in the movie!

Both were in their 70s by this time but still active and what great troopers they were here just as in all their other movies. I loved them in Grumpy Old Men and this was their 10th out of 11 movies where they were teamed up, this time as a pair of dance hosts on a cruise ship. Matthau, however, can't dance (although Lemmon can) but is scheming to get a wealthy widow. The plot thickens when they find out that dance hosts are forbidden from fraternizing outside with the women guests. He sets his sights on Dyan Cannon who is in the company of a stuffy British passenger.Dyan Cannon and Brent Spiner rounded out the cast and it was great to see Spiner in a different role from Star Trek's the Next Generation's Data, the android. If someone wasn't familiar with Star Trek they might not even know who he was. The backdrop of the cruise ship was perfect and having taken at least one cruise since this movie came out (1997) when I was much younger and met a few of the dance hosts, their parts/roles were more meaningful for me.

433278,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,6304698305,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[11, 11]","Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are considered one of the great film teams.  Their partnership created 11 films (one film Walter starred in Jack directed and two films they both appeared in but were not the costars) over 32 years and created the one of the most beloved pairings, Oscar Madison and Felix Unger.Out to Sea was the 10th film and it is a rehash of many of their other films (together and apart).  Herb (Lemmon) is a widower.  Charlie (Matthau) is his brother-in-law.  Just as Oscar and Felix, Herb and Jack are opposites.  Charlie has gotten into some trouble with loan sharks and needs to get away for a while.  He decides to take a cruise and takes his brother in law along.The thing that he doesn't tell him is the reason it is free is that they are to be dance hosts.  And there is one strict rule that they are not to fraternize with the paying guests.  But Charlie is planning to catch himself a rich widow.  And on the airplane Herb meets a beautiful widow (Gloria DeHaven).  But Charlie introduces Herb as his doctor.  Herb runs into her, of course, on the boat and tries to keep up his cover.Charlie stumbles into a state room and meets an heiress (Dyan Cannon) and her mother (Elaine Strich.)  Of course Charlie goes after the daughter.  And the cruise director (Brent Spiner) is trying to catch the boys.There is a lot of deception going on but it is not just the boys.  In the end the boys get the girls and we have a happy ending.Jack and Walter are masters of their craft. And while this film is as creaky as they come, the cast make it work.  Dyan Cannon gives one of her best performances (probably since her Oscar nominated work in Heaven Can Wait.)  And it is great to see Gloria DeHaven back in front of the cameras - and looking fabulous!  Donald O'Connor gets to show he still can dance as one of the host along with Hal Linden.  Golden Girl Rue McClannahan also makes an appearance as the owner of the ship.As I have said before a bad Lemmon Matthau film is better than most other films.DVD EXTRAS: None",4,Lemmon and Matthau make the best of a weak script,1148083200,"05 20, 2006",2006,2037,"['Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'are', 'considered', 'one', 'great', 'film', 'teams', 'partnership', 'created', '11', 'films', 'one', 'film', 'Walter', 'starred', 'Jack', 'directed', 'two', 'films', 'appeared', 'were', 'not', 'costars', '32', 'years', 'created', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'pairings', 'Oscar', 'Madison', 'Felix', 'Unger.Out', 'Sea', 'was', '10th', 'film', 'rehash', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'together', 'apart', 'Herb', 'Lemmon', 'widower', 'Charlie', 'Matthau', 'brother-in-law', 'Just', 'Oscar', 'Felix', 'Herb', 'Jack', 'are', 'opposites', 'Charlie', 'gotten', 'trouble', 'loan', 'sharks', 'needs', 'get', 'away', 'while', 'take', 'cruise', 'brother', 'law', 'along.The', 'thing', ""n't"", 'tell', 'reason', 'free', 'are', 'be', 'dance', 'hosts', 'one', 'strict', 'rule', 'are', 'not', 'fraternize', 'paying', 'guests', 'Charlie', 'planning', 'catch', 'rich', 'widow', 'airplane', 'Herb', 'beautiful', 'widow', 'Gloria', 'DeHaven', 'Charlie', 'Herb', 'doctor', 'Herb', 'course', 'boat', 'tries', 'keep', 'up', 'cover.Charlie', 'state', 'room', 'heiress', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'mother', 'Elaine', 'Strich', 'course', 'Charlie', 'daughter', 'cruise', 'director', 'Brent', 'Spiner', 'trying', 'catch', 'boys.There', 'lot', 'deception', 'going', 'not', 'just', 'boys', 'end', 'boys', 'get', 'girls', 'have', 'happy', 'ending.Jack', 'Walter', 'are', 'masters', 'craft', 'film', 'as', 'creaky', 'come', 'cast', 'make', 'work', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'probably', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'work', 'Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'great', 'see', 'Gloria', 'DeHaven', 'back', 'front', 'cameras', 'looking', 'fabulous', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'show', 'still', 'can', 'dance', 'one', 'host', 'Hal', 'Linden', 'Golden', 'Girl', 'Rue', 'McClannahan', 'also', 'appearance', 'owner', 'ship.As', 'have', 'said', 'bad', 'Lemmon', 'Matthau', 'film', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'films.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",Out to Sea VHS

His show-numbers alone are worth watching this film. And there is Donald O'Connor in a small but wonderful part (you don't believe his age if you see him dance - just amazing!).
