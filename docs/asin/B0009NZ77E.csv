Erland,"[7, 8]","`Flight From Death - The Quest for Immortality' (`03) is a thought provoking journey into the most basic of all mans' fears, the fear of impending death. Using Ernst Becker's classic work `The Denial of Death' as a springboard, this documentary explores the ongoing research by a group of cultural anthropologist and their formulation of what they call, ""Terror Management Theory.""Overall I found this documentary to be intelligent, informative and at times emotional. Its one weakness in my estimation is its brief meandering into international politics and its convert sermonizing on the evil within. I sincerely doubt that our reaction to the events of 9/11 were based on our quest for immortality.

909287,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B0009NZ77E,J from NY,"[4, 4]","""The Flight From Death: The Quest For Immortality"" is a moving documentary and deals with the subject that, indeed, most people spend their lives trying to avoid: mortality--for all that, though, it isn't a very good representation of Ernest Becker's actual ideas.There seems to be a  misunderstanding on the part of Greg Bennick and Patrick Shen, the writers of the documentary, that Becker's life changing and devastating sociological/existential tome ""The Denial of Death"" is a different book than Irvin Yalom's ""Existential Psychotherapy"".  Despite having undeniable similarities, they are two different thinkers.  The majority of the documentary is spent politely blaming religion for most of the wars in the world and most human conflicts, though there are a few times when economic strife is mentioned.  Professor Sheldon Solomon, a colorful commentator and university teacher, says at one point ""My god is better than your god and we'll kick your butt to prove it.""  Then the film cuts to a series of footage with people beating each other up in mass crowds, including a rally headed by Mao Zedong.  Strangely enough it is not mentioned that Mao was a ruthless secularist, or that thousands of people have been martyred in Communist countries for holding religious beliefs.While I'm not denying that religion has contributed to wars and that ""belief"" in a God has for some been an ""immortality project"", Becker himself often put more emphasis on military force and man's lust for power as being an immortality ideology than religion.  If I recall correctly, ""The Denial of Death"" is more informed by the ideas of Soren Kierkegaard and Paul Tillich than it is by any hard line materialists.The cultural fabrication/collective death denial that Becker wrote about may included some forms of *religion*, but he left a very definite door open to the transcendent, as evidenced by every book he wrote.After 9/11 a lot of politicans used the word ""evil"" as a way to describe the events, and this is somehow wrong in the view of the filmmakers?  What else do we call it when two buildings full of thousands of people are rammed into by planes?  The reaction to September 11th was not religious in nature at all (here I am referring to the invasion of Iraq, not Afghanistan) but a deliberately deceitful series of political maneuvers by men interested in money and power.On a more positive note, one is not going to leave this documentary unaffected.  The ephemeral nature of our material existence is driven home with real poetry and force, and one cannot help but be impressed by the plight of the female cancer survivor who greets death not with horror or depression, but with a graceful acceptance.  Commendable also is the depth of thought and the sympathy for the poor demonstrated by Professor Sheldon.  If you're interested in an actual elucidation of Ernest Becker's work, though, I'd suggest reading his books.",4,Very touching,1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,2920,"['Flight', 'From', 'Death', 'Quest', 'Immortality', 'moving', 'documentary', 'deals', 'subject', 'indeed', 'most', 'people', 'spend', 'lives', 'trying', 'avoid', 'mortality', 'though', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'representation', 'Ernest', 'Becker', 'actual', 'ideas.There', 'be', 'misunderstanding', 'part', 'Greg', 'Bennick', 'Patrick', 'Shen', 'writers', 'documentary', 'Becker', 'life', 'changing', 'devastating', 'sociological/existential', 'tome', 'Denial', 'Death', 'different', 'book', 'Irvin', 'Yalom', 'Existential', 'Psychotherapy', 'having', 'undeniable', 'similarities', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'thinkers', 'majority', 'documentary', 'spent', 'politely', 'blaming', 'religion', 'most', 'wars', 'world', 'most', 'human', 'conflicts', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'economic', 'strife', 'mentioned', 'Professor', 'Sheldon', 'Solomon', 'colorful', 'commentator', 'university', 'teacher', 'one', 'point', 'god', 'better', 'god', ""'ll"", 'kick', 'butt', 'prove', 'Then', 'film', 'cuts', 'series', 'footage', 'people', 'beating', 'other', 'up', 'mass', 'crowds', 'including', 'rally', 'headed', 'Mao', 'Zedong', 'Strangely', 'not', 'mentioned', 'Mao', 'was', 'ruthless', 'secularist', 'thousands', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'martyred', 'Communist', 'countries', 'holding', 'religious', 'beliefs.While', ""'m"", 'not', 'denying', 'religion', 'contributed', 'wars', 'belief', 'God', 'been', 'immortality', 'project', 'Becker', 'often', 'put', 'more', 'emphasis', 'military', 'force', 'man', 'lust', 'power', 'being', 'immortality', 'ideology', 'religion', 'recall', 'correctly', 'Denial', 'Death', 'more', 'informed', 'ideas', 'Soren', 'Kierkegaard', 'Paul', 'Tillich', 'hard', 'line', 'materialists.The', 'cultural', 'fabrication/collective', 'death', 'denial', 'Becker', 'wrote', 'about', 'may', 'included', 'forms', '*religion*', 'left', 'very', 'definite', 'door', 'open', 'transcendent', 'evidenced', 'book', '9/11', 'lot', 'politicans', 'used', 'word', 'evil', 'way', 'describe', 'events', 'somehow', 'wrong', 'view', 'filmmakers', 'What', 'else', 'do', 'call', 'when', 'two', 'buildings', 'full', 'thousands', 'people', 'are', 'rammed', 'planes', 'reaction', 'September', '11th', 'was', 'not', 'religious', 'nature', 'here', 'am', 'referring', 'invasion', 'Iraq', 'not', 'Afghanistan', 'deliberately', 'deceitful', 'series', 'political', 'maneuvers', 'men', 'interested', 'money', 'power.On', 'more', 'positive', 'note', 'one', 'not', 'going', 'leave', 'documentary', 'unaffected', 'ephemeral', 'nature', 'material', 'existence', 'driven', 'home', 'real', 'poetry', 'force', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'impressed', 'plight', 'female', 'cancer', 'survivor', 'who', 'death', 'not', 'horror', 'depression', 'graceful', 'acceptance', 'Commendable', 'also', 'depth', 'thought', 'sympathy', 'poor', 'demonstrated', 'Professor', 'Sheldon', ""'re"", 'interested', 'actual', 'elucidation', 'Ernest', 'Becker', 'work', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'reading', 'books']",Flight From Death - The Quest for Immortality
