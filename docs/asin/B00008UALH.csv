747448,A3HH9LJEBCYOZP,B00008UALH,"AmericanBulldogger ""Foreign Film Lover""","[6, 6]","I looked in every book and cranny I could find about the Moxley murder through the years. I have always been intrigued by the case and wondered why it took so long for someone to finally put this into television/movie form.  If the Moxley murder interests you, I highly recommend this movie.  It compliments the book nicely and gives a unique, creative perspective to looking through the glass darkly.  I am convinced they finally got the right man, even though I don't necessarily agree with the way it all went down.  Just think... if those rich folks had only told the TRUTH in the beginning and accepted the punishment, Michael would have been charged as a juvenile and most likely been out by now! He would have hopefully gotten some help and possibly even turned into a productive member of society. Instead, his own family contributed to his personal hell by bouncing him around reform schools and such, only adding to his misery, as well as to that of the Moxleys.  The state attorney's office and those corrupt officials who sat and did NOTHING on this case for twenty something years should truly be ashamed of themselves.  It's despicable and disgraceful!  God Bless the Moxley family who had to wait so long to see justice for Martha.  I'm glad the story continues to be told, that we shall never forget what happened to this beautiful, young lady in the town of Greenwich on Hacker's night in 1975.",5,Gripping,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,1411,"['looked', 'book', 'cranny', 'could', 'find', 'Moxley', 'murder', 'years', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'intrigued', 'case', 'wondered', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'someone', 'finally', 'put', 'television/movie', 'form', 'Moxley', 'murder', 'interests', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'book', 'nicely', 'unique', 'creative', 'perspective', 'looking', 'glass', 'darkly', 'am', 'convinced', 'finally', 'got', 'right', 'man', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'agree', 'way', 'went', 'down', 'Just', 'think', 'rich', 'folks', 'had', 'only', 'told', 'TRUTH', 'beginning', 'accepted', 'punishment', 'Michael', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'charged', 'juvenile', 'most', 'likely', 'been', 'out', 'now', 'would', 'have', 'hopefully', 'gotten', 'help', 'possibly', 'even', 'turned', 'productive', 'member', 'society', 'Instead', 'own', 'family', 'contributed', 'personal', 'hell', 'bouncing', 'around', 'reform', 'schools', 'such', 'only', 'adding', 'misery', 'as', 'well', 'Moxleys', 'state', 'attorney', 'office', 'corrupt', 'officials', 'who', 'sat', 'did', 'NOTHING', 'case', 'twenty', 'something', 'years', 'should', 'truly', 'be', 'ashamed', 'despicable', 'disgraceful', 'God', 'Bless', 'Moxley', 'family', 'who', 'had', 'wait', 'so', 'long', 'see', 'justice', 'Martha', ""'m"", 'glad', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'shall', 'never', 'forget', 'what', 'happened', 'beautiful', 'young', 'lady', 'town', 'Greenwich', 'Hacker', 'night', '1975']",N/A

I enjoyed Mark Fuhrman's book however, I think there could have been a better job done with this movie.  The music gave it a haunting mood, but it was so shallow and left out so much of how that creep Michael Skaekel and his uber-rich family did everything in their power to bury this by pure avoidance of the law using their name, money, political connections and big-time  lawyers to do their dirty work (Chappaquiddick anyone?).  I would love to see a real movie with the in-depth murder, history of the Skaekels, Moxley's, the years and years of time and people involved to finally put this sad tale to rest. I give Mark Fuhrman kudos for working on this case and finally getting some satisfaction by putting a murderer in jail after that joke of a trial and horrible double murder he got sucked into that ultimately made a mockery of everything and let a killer have a not guilty verdict.

747451,A1HO9J4DCQDGP9,B00008UALH,"Kali ""bengaligirl""","[11, 17]","In the early 1970s a young girl was brutally murdered in a wealthy conclave.  For 25 years there was a wall of silence around her death, everyone knew who had done it but no one was saying, for the murderer was part of the then fireproof Kennedy clan.  For 25 years a mother waited in vain for her daughter's killer to be bought to justice and eventually her patience paid off but not before a lot of dark secrets had been exposed and a lot of people were forced to confront their own ruthless ambitions and indifference to a vicious and senseless murder.This movie really surprised me.  I didn't expect it to be any good but it was such a bargain at 80c I had to buy it!However I was pleasantly surprised at how good the acting was, and I especially liked the way the Director jumped from the past to the present, to show the audience which way the present day investigation was going.I wasn't sure how I was going to react to the protagonist, Mark Fuhrman who was the real life racist police officer in the OJ Simpson case, however Christopher Meloni was excellent and gave a good portrayal as a man troubled by his past but moving on from his mistakes for good or bad.This movie could have been really disjointed; the Director took a real chance and in my humble opinion he did a pretty good job overall.However I have to say the best part of the film was the narration, done by an unknown actress called Maggie Grace who portrays Martha Moxley in the film.  I found it spooky and touching to have the story unfolded before me by the dead girl herself, talking about what had happened to her, and what she might have done in her life if she had lived.I suspect the movie itself is more of a fairy tale than fact but it was well presented, well acted and was very enjoyable.  I do however think the wall of silence that Mark Fuhrman ""hit"" during his investigation was probably based on fact, no one in the wealthy little town that Martha died in wanted their past dirty linen exposed; least of all those who helped perpetrate the cover up in the first place.There is also a haunting musical score that links the past to the present, including some great 1970s tracks to separate the two timelines, very tastefully and artistically done for what is obviously quite a low budget film in comparison to the many Blockbusters that are chucked at us nowadays.A final pointer but poignant pointer is that if Martha Moxley had been Black, I doubt very much if this movie would have been made, because her murder would still be unsolved even now in 2004, the fact she was young, beautiful and white, meant that for her that eventually justice was served.",4,Surprisingly good movie,1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,2647,"['early', '1970s', 'young', 'girl', 'was', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'wealthy', 'conclave', '25', 'years', 'there', 'was', 'wall', 'silence', 'death', 'everyone', 'knew', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'one', 'was', 'saying', 'murderer', 'was', 'part', 'then', 'fireproof', 'Kennedy', 'clan', '25', 'years', 'mother', 'waited', 'vain', 'daughter', 'killer', 'be', 'bought', 'justice', 'eventually', 'patience', 'paid', 'off', 'not', 'lot', 'dark', 'secrets', 'had', 'been', 'exposed', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'forced', 'confront', 'own', 'ruthless', 'ambitions', 'indifference', 'vicious', 'senseless', 'murder.This', 'movie', 'really', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'such', 'bargain', '80c', 'had', 'buy', 'However', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'especially', 'liked', 'way', 'Director', 'jumped', 'past', 'present', 'show', 'audience', 'way', 'present', 'day', 'investigation', 'was', 'going.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'react', 'protagonist', 'Mark', 'Fuhrman', 'who', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'racist', 'police', 'officer', 'OJ', 'Simpson', 'case', 'however', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'was', 'excellent', 'gave', 'good', 'portrayal', 'man', 'troubled', 'past', 'moving', 'mistakes', 'good', 'bad.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'disjointed', 'Director', 'took', 'real', 'chance', 'humble', 'opinion', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'have', 'say', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'narration', 'done', 'unknown', 'actress', 'called', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'who', 'Martha', 'Moxley', 'film', 'found', 'spooky', 'touching', 'have', 'story', 'unfolded', 'dead', 'girl', 'talking', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'life', 'had', 'suspect', 'movie', 'more', 'fairy', 'tale', 'fact', 'was', 'well', 'presented', 'well', 'acted', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'do', 'however', 'think', 'wall', 'silence', 'Mark', 'Fuhrman', 'hit', 'investigation', 'was', 'probably', 'based', 'fact', 'one', 'wealthy', 'little', 'town', 'Martha', 'died', 'wanted', 'past', 'dirty', 'linen', 'exposed', 'least', 'who', 'helped', 'perpetrate', 'cover', 'up', 'first', 'place.There', 'also', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'past', 'present', 'including', 'great', '1970s', 'tracks', 'separate', 'two', 'timelines', 'very', 'tastefully', 'artistically', 'done', 'what', 'obviously', 'quite', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'comparison', 'many', 'Blockbusters', 'are', 'chucked', 'nowadays.A', 'final', 'pointer', 'poignant', 'pointer', 'Martha', 'Moxley', 'had', 'been', 'Black', 'doubt', 'very', 'much', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'murder', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'unsolved', 'even', 'now', '2004', 'fact', 'was', 'young', 'beautiful', 'white', 'meant', 'eventually', 'justice', 'was', 'served']",N/A

There's a true unsolved murder begging for justice.  With those ingredients, one would think it would be hard to misstep.
