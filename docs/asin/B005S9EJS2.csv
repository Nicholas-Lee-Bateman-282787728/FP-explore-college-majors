This is an ACTION movie---not drama, not thriller, not romance, not comedy, not oscar material. Plain and simple it is an action movie that will keep you entertained for its entire duration. Stallone is Stallone. He's tough, he's irascible, he's macho, he's a hero. And even when he plays a character with a seedy and violent history, he's still a hero! He's tough and merciless on the bad guys, but he still has a soft spot in his heart for his movie daughter, so don't mess with her or you will incur his wrath! As a hitman in this movie he plays his role well, and there is plenty of action with bullets flying in all directions numerous times. Another aspect of the plot involves his teaming up with a DC detective---both of them want to find the bad guys who killed their respective partners. As is predictable they ride in the same car so they spend a lot of time arguing about procedures and about their plans to catch those who double-crossed them. All the bad guys look real menacing---great acting by all.  Sarah Stahl does only an ok job in her character as Stallone's daughter. The plot is all credible and makes sense, except maybe for the required mano-a-mano fight between Stallone and the baddest bad guy in the end. We all know it's macho hormones at work, but it was well choreographed. I thoroughly enjoyed this film: good acting, good plot, great action.

Don't let the critics fool you, this is a must see if you are a fan of this type of film. My girlfriend who is not a fan, even liked this movie. We found ourselves laughing at the banter between Stallone and his new partner, who happens to be an Asian cop. Stallone is constantly throwing racist comments at him, but it is all in good fun. Stallone's age works to his advantage, his face is chiseled from years of wear and tear, as is the rest of his body. He looks like he was carved out of stone. There is no other actor like him. Christian Slater plays a small, but good roll, as a crooked lawyer. The masquerade ball he throws for his guests is done well. It's fun to watch Stallone creeping around the party wearing a strange mask. I don't want to give a bunch of this film away, so i will just say this. High energy, well acted, well directed, characters are very believable. Go see the movie then buy it when it comes out. It is a keeper! Oh, did I mention Stallone gets into an ax fight??

Whereas Sam Spade didn't quite cozy to Miles Archer contract killer Jimmy Bonomo(Sylvester Stallone) liked his. Detective Taylor Kwan(Sung Kang) comes to the Big Easy to investigate the hit on a dirty cop from his turf, the District of Columbia, and finds the local constabulary less than helpful.  Not by choice but through convenience Bonomo and Kwan join forces to find the killers.  What they find is a cesspool of dirty cops, shifty lawyers, unscrupulous land developers, and ice cold mercenaries.  It's up to the uneasy duo to navigate this tangled web of deceit, double crosses, and triple crosses.  This a return to form on two fronts.  Director Walter Hill has been absent from the scene for almost ten years.  Here he is revisiting the setting of some of his biggest successes, ""Southern Comfort"" and ""Johnny Handsome"" come to mind.  His early work suggests a Sam Peckinpah influence but here he also seems to be channeling John Woo.  A lot of critics have thrown dirt on the career of Stallone, that it was as dead as an antelope carcass.  His resume would suggest otherwise but that's beside the point.  His work here seems to indicate that Stallone waited until he became sufficiently scarred and weather beaten to tackle the part and his performance is outstanding.  Stallone and Kang have a decent rapport though the latter comes off as wooden at times but Stallone compensates for that.  Jason Momoa is memorably chilling as Keegan the hit man out to get Jimmy.  The source of the movie is from a graphic novel and it does have a classic pulp feel to it.  I remember this film released in the dead of Winter to decent reviews but laid an egg at the box office.

1499662,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B005S9EJS2,David Girod,"[0, 0]","As a child of the 80's, I grew up on Stallone's action films. I have fond memories of seeing &#34;Tango & Cash&#34;, &#34;Cobra&#34; and the &#34;Rambo&#34; movies in the theater. I was really looking forward to &#34;Bullet to the Head&#34;, having Stallone face off against Jason Momoa (Khal Drogo in &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;) seemed like it would be a lot of fun. Toss director Walter Hill (&#34;The Warriors&#34;, &#34;48 Hrs.&#34;) into the mix and it seems like a can't miss.Stallone plays Jimmy Bonomo, an old hitman who is set up after he and his partner take out a corrupt cop. Jimmy's partner is killed and he's been stiffed on getting on paid for the hit. Jimmy must team up with a detective from Washington, the corrupt cop's former partner, to find out was behind the hit and to get revenge on the people who killed his partner.The Good:*Jason Momoa - The guy is huge and has charisma. While not properly used here, the scene that he's part of just pop.*The Fight Scenes - Unlike most of the action movies filmed today, where we get a bunch of quick cuts, or shaky cam. Hill knows how to showcase a good fight scene, and can ratchet up the tension as it plays out.The Bad:Everything else.The movie starts really strong with Stallone and his partner taking out the corrupt cop, and even carries over into the next scene where Jimmy's partner gets killed in a honky tonk. But from there the film starts to decline, and never really recovers. Stallone delivers his lines in a sleepy monotone, and he's partnered with Sung Kang (The Fast and the Furious). I'm not sure if it's Kang, or if it's the way his character is written, but he's horrible!! There is no chemistry between he and Stallone, why he's been wedged into this film is something I really wonder about? He's supposedly a straight arrow cop, yet he's allowing Stallone to carry out his mission of revenge saying things like &#34;I'll get you when this is over&#34;, and in the next scene he let's Stallone kill someone else, then repeats how he'll get him the next time.There is just no fun to this film. They try to inject humor here and there, but it falls flat every time. Jason Momoa's character finally gets to exhibit some personality at the end of the film, but by then it's too late. I'm not even sure what his character's motivation is in the movie??? The final gripe I had is that the movie is simply so dark. Most of the film is very underlit. Even the daytime shots are muted, and the finale takes place in an abandoned factory, and most of the action takes place in the shadows or in darkened rooms.Pass this one over. If you want to see a modern take on old school action flicks, pick up Swarzenegger's &#34;The Last Stand&#34;.

It seems unless filmmakers can bore you to death with hours on end of CGI, they are not happy.  They need to rethink things just a little...The story here is very simple:  Sylvester Stallone plays a hit man who goes about his business with the precision of a seasoned surgeon.  He dissects what needs to be dissected and he does not rethink what grief or misery he may have caused.  He know that his age and the business he is in do not account for any remorse.  In the opening scene, he and his partner take down a bad guy and this ""hit"" does not go unnoticed.  His partner soon meets a very violent end, and Sylvester Stallone is now out for revenge.  He meets an Asian detective (who has also lost a partner) and thus a very tentative liaison begins.  This may have been the biggest problem for the movie--there is absolutely NO chemistry between Stallone and his co-star.  However, there is non-stop action and the viewer will soon see why the film was named ""Bullet to the Head.""This film does not claim to be a cinematic masterpiece.

He's very much been in the limelight recently. The 67-year old actor won't be held down by his age. After a 3-year hiatus back in 2003, he returned to the ring by acting in and directing ""Rocky Balboa."" Not content to just re-visit one of his most well-known characters, Stallone also put the headband back on for a fourth helping of ""First Blood"" in ""Rambo.""James Bonomo (Sylvester Stallone) is a New Orleans hitman whose partner (Jon Seda) was just murdered in a double-cross. Washington D.C. detective Taylor Kwan (Sung Kang) is sent to Louisiana's capital city to investigate the death of his former colleague (Holt McCallany). Bonomo and Kwan form an unlikely alliance after they discover the two killings are somehow linked.After the two star-filled ""Expendables"" films, Stallone obviously felt it was time to test his merit as a one-man show with ""Bullet to the Head."" Unfortunately, audiences didn't respond so well to his first solo outing as an action anti-hero. It's a real shame, because the movie is an entertaining return to the high-octane and high body count days of the 1980s and 1990s.I'm not saying ""Bullet to the Head"" features only Stallone providing all the excitement. It's very much a buddy-cop film and co-star Kang provides plenty of thrills himself. Nonetheless, Stallone is obviously the one carrying all the star power.We can debate all day whether he's right or wrong in his use of steroids. Let's just talk about the surface issue here. Stallone looks darn good for a guy who could be a great-grandfather. He's ripped and his upper body resembles a King Cobra about to strike. He doesn't look half-bad in a fitted three-piece suit, either.Stallone does what he does best in ""Bullet to the Head."" He plays a tough guy with a calm demeanor who doesn't say much. Instead, he lets his fists and guns do the talking. He might have a stunt double that does all his fighting for him, but Stallone still moves effortlessly in every scene. You never stop once to ask whether Director Walter Hill yelled cut and put someone else in to fight Jason Momoa or any of the other guys his character gets into scraps with.Director Walter Hill uses ""Bullet to the Head"" as a reminder to audiences that he once made violent action films like this for a living. He's the same guy who gave us such classic popcorn flicks as both the ""48 Hrs."" movies, ""The Warriors,"" ""Red Heat,"" and others. I'm not going to say that this is better or worse than any of those films, but it's an enjoyable way to blow 90-minutes after a hard day at work or on a Saturday afternoon.""Bullet to the Head"" works hard to earn its R rating. Like any good action film from the 1980s, there's plenty of violence. The blood spray from gunshot wounds and actual onscreen carnage is much heavier here, though. There's also plenty of nudity and loads of bad language. Its everything one would expect from these types of movies.The DVD version of ""Bullet to the Head"" includes a couple extra features. There's audio commentary provided by Director Walter Hill.

1499679,A25GMONBLGQE1U,B005S9EJS2,"H. Ross ""biblemonkey""","[1, 1]","What do you get when you take a complete misunderstanding of the noir genre and combine it with action movie clich&eacute;s and bad acting? You get ""Bullet to the Head"".James Bonomo is a hit man for hire who has all the personality and charm of your average brick. He is played by Sylvester Stallone who yawns out his lines like he's being paid to be as dull as possible. James and his partner Hank (Holt McCallany) are sent to kill a crooked cop who is blackmailing a crooked lawyer and his crooked business partner (Christian Slater and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje respectively). That's a lot of crooked folks and there are more to come. They complete the hit, minus the cop's hooker date, and turn up to receive their fee. Unfortunately for them their bosses don't want anyone who has come in contact with the evidence to remain alive so they send psychotic mercenary Keegan (Jason Mamoa of ""Conan the Barbarian"" reboot fame) to take care of them.So you have hitmen being hit by another hitman because the bosses don't trust the first hitmen. Why do the bosses trust the second hitman? How do they know he won't turn on them? Well, they don't. Spoiler: They should have thought this through better. But, then again clear thinking isn't really this movie's strong point.Enter Sung Kang as Taylor Kwon, a cop from D.C. investigating the death of his ex-partner, the crooked cop. Kwon has a smartphone with which he can gather seemingly omniscient information at the drop of a hat. Is there an app for that? Where do I sign up? Kwon uses his phone rather than his brain so often that he can't see the glaringly obvious plot devices until they are holding a gun to his head. Literally. It doesn't help that Sung Kang plays the part as though he just took an Ambien. To call his performance lack luster is an insult to lack luster.What follows from here is a dull slog through half understood noir film clich&eacute;s, action movie clich&eacute;s, and digital blood splatters. Someone needed to tell Stallone and company that ""noir"" doesn't mean ""slow and boring"" and that ""action"" needs a ""reason"" if we are to ""care"". Stallone's hitman seems about as torn up about his partner's death as he would over his T.V. breaking. He seems bored and unsure of what to do. This is not exactly a driving passion, but rather seems like he is thinking, ""Hey, I got nothin' better to do. Might as well avenge somethin'"". He is so disinterested in his quest that the audience has no reason to care either. The same goes for Sung Kang and his search for the killers of his partner. He says repeatedly that he just wants to arrest the ""Big Guys At The Top"" and that he didn't even like his partner, so there is no personal stake at all. Then why does he need James? Kwon provides nearly every piece of useful information with his godlike phone and he constantly whines about how James does things, so why doesn't he go it alone? Oh, right. This is a buddy cop comedy. Or is it a noir? Or an action movie? The constant narration leads us to think ""noir"", but the action is so pointlessly violent that we think ""action movie"". And the banter leads directly to ""buddy cop comedy"". So which is it? I have given up trying to figure out what their intent was and I think the director did, too.The plot holes are too numerous to mention, such as James saying his life is perfect for a hitman because he has ""no kids, no family"" and then within 15 minutes we are introduced to his daughter. And one idiot plot point after another rolls of the screen like so much liquid waste. Does the daughter have a tragic past? Is the hero cop a genius one minute and a drooling moron the next? Will the psychotic mercenary Keegan go insane for no apparent reason and challenge James to a fight using conveniently place fire axes? If you have seen more than one badly written action film in your time you know the answer to these questions and more posed by the film. Don't forget to keep an eye out for the amazingly obvious and totally unneeded romance subplot to complete your ""crappy movie bingo"" card.This is a movie without a brain, a cast, or a point. It is boring, nonsensical, and just plain lazily written. Even recommending it as a guilty pleasure would be to do the viewer a disservice. If you like guilty pleasure/cheesy action movies, find yourself a copy of ""Commando"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger and you will be far more entertained.I can't believe I just wrote that.",2,Noir For Dummies,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,4440,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'take', 'complete', 'misunderstanding', 'noir', 'genre', 'combine', 'action', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'bad', 'acting', 'get', 'Bullet', 'Head', 'Bonomo', 'hit', 'man', 'hire', 'who', 'personality', 'charm', 'average', 'brick', 'played', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'who', 'out', 'lines', 'being', 'paid', 'be', 'as', 'dull', 'possible', 'James', 'partner', 'Hank', 'Holt', 'McCallany', 'are', 'sent', 'kill', 'crooked', 'cop', 'who', 'blackmailing', 'crooked', 'lawyer', 'crooked', 'business', 'partner', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaje', 'respectively', 'lot', 'crooked', 'folks', 'are', 'more', 'come', 'complete', 'hit', 'cop', 'hooker', 'date', 'turn', 'up', 'receive', 'fee', 'Unfortunately', 'bosses', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'who', 'come', 'contact', 'evidence', 'remain', 'alive', 'send', 'psychotic', 'mercenary', 'Keegan', 'Jason', 'Mamoa', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'reboot', 'fame', 'take', 'care', 'them.So', 'have', 'hitmen', 'being', 'hit', 'hitman', 'bosses', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'first', 'hitmen', 'Why', 'do', 'bosses', 'trust', 'second', 'hitman', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'turn', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'Spoiler', 'should', 'have', 'thought', 'better', 'then', 'again', 'clear', 'thinking', ""n't"", 'really', 'movie', 'strong', 'point.Enter', 'Sung', 'Kang', 'Taylor', 'Kwon', 'cop', 'D.C.', 'investigating', 'death', 'ex-partner', 'crooked', 'cop', 'Kwon', 'smartphone', 'can', 'gather', 'seemingly', 'omniscient', 'information', 'drop', 'hat', 'app', 'Where', 'do', 'sign', 'up', 'Kwon', 'phone', 'rather', 'brain', 'so', 'often', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'glaringly', 'obvious', 'plot', 'devices', 'are', 'holding', 'gun', 'head', 'Literally', ""n't"", 'help', 'Sung', 'Kang', 'part', 'just', 'took', 'Ambien', 'call', 'performance', 'lack', 'luster', 'insult', 'lack', 'luster.What', 'here', 'dull', 'slog', 'half', 'understood', 'noir', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'action', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'digital', 'blood', 'splatters', 'Someone', 'needed', 'tell', 'Stallone', 'company', 'noir', ""n't"", 'mean', 'slow', 'boring', 'action', 'reason', 'are', 'care', 'Stallone', 'hitman', 'torn', 'partner', 'death', 'would', 'over', 'T.V', 'breaking', 'bored', 'unsure', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'exactly', 'driving', 'passion', 'rather', 'thinking', 'Hey', 'got', 'nothin', 'better', 'do', 'Might', 'as', 'well', 'somethin', 'so', 'disinterested', 'quest', 'audience', 'reason', 'care', 'either', 'same', 'Sung', 'Kang', 'search', 'killers', 'partner', 'repeatedly', 'just', 'arrest', 'Big', 'Guys', 'Top', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'like', 'partner', 'personal', 'stake', 'Then', 'why', 'need', 'James', 'Kwon', 'nearly', 'piece', 'useful', 'information', 'godlike', 'phone', 'constantly', 'how', 'James', 'things', 'so', 'why', ""n't"", 'go', 'alone', 'Oh', 'right', 'buddy', 'cop', 'comedy', 'noir', 'action', 'movie', 'constant', 'narration', 'think', 'noir', 'action', 'so', 'pointlessly', 'violent', 'think', 'action', 'movie', 'banter', 'directly', 'buddy', 'cop', 'comedy', 'So', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'intent', 'was', 'think', 'director', 'did', 'too.The', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'such', 'James', 'saying', 'life', 'perfect', 'hitman', 'kids', 'family', 'then', '15', 'minutes', 'are', 'introduced', 'daughter', 'one', 'idiot', 'plot', 'point', 'rolls', 'screen', 'so', 'much', 'liquid', 'waste', 'daughter', 'have', 'tragic', 'past', 'hero', 'genius', 'one', 'minute', 'drooling', 'moron', 'next', 'Will', 'psychotic', 'mercenary', 'Keegan', 'go', 'insane', 'apparent', 'reason', 'challenge', 'James', 'fight', 'using', 'conveniently', 'place', 'fire', 'axes', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'one', 'badly', 'written', 'action', 'film', 'time', 'know', 'answer', 'questions', 'more', 'posed', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'amazingly', 'obvious', 'totally', 'unneeded', 'romance', 'subplot', 'complete', 'crappy', 'movie', 'bingo', 'card.This', 'movie', 'brain', 'cast', 'point', 'boring', 'nonsensical', 'just', 'plain', 'lazily', 'written', 'Even', 'recommending', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'would', 'be', 'do', 'viewer', 'disservice', 'like', 'guilty', 'pleasure/cheesy', 'action', 'movies', 'find', 'copy', 'Commando', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'will', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'entertained.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'just', 'wrote']",N/A

1499691,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B005S9EJS2,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Every once in a while a movie comes along where I have a hard time articulating how I felt about it. Well, Bullet to the Head is one of those films. It comes out swinging and doesn't let up until the final piece of narration is spoken by Stallone. It's a non-stop action film, but if fails to be anything more than that. In fact, it fails to even try. Now that I think about it, I think this is where most of my distaste stems from. It's not that I'm against some mindless action, but at least give me a story that feels different. Give me something substantial. Unfortunately, Bullet to the Head fails in both of these regards.You follow a hitman by the name of Jimmy Bobo (Stallone). The movie starts with him and his partner Louis (Jon Seda) killing a corrupt policeman, but because of Jimmy's ""no women, no children"" code, he leaves the prostitute Lola (Weronika Rosati) alive. No surprise to the viewer, Lola goes to the police and out-of-state Washington Police Detective Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang) concludes that Jimmy and Louis were the ones who killed Greely - the corrupt policeman. After Louis is killed at a bar, Jimmy makes it his duty to find his killer - Keegan (Jason Momoa) - all while hooking up with unlikely accomplice Detective Kwon. This mismatched duo soon realize that they both need each other if wish to succeed in their missions.If I had to narrow it down, my biggest issue with Bullet to the Head is how formulaic it is. They give you a little bit of dialogue, then there's a firefight, some more dialogue, a fistfight, and then they rinse and repeat. While the movie is only 90 minutes long, this repetitiveness makes it feel much longer than it actually is. Not only that, but only a few of these action sequences feel new or doing anything inventive. Most of the time these firefights hold strong similarities to action films in the past which only bogs down the experience even more. With that said, though, the ax fight towards the end of the movie was probably one of the most memorable sequences from the entire film. It was unlike anything I've ever seen from an action flick and I enjoyed it immensely despite it feeling extremely scripted.Another thing I noticed was that, at times, there was too much going on in the story. You see, you're not just following Jimmy and Taylor. There's also a corrupt politician from South America named Robert Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). In reality he's kind of the backbone for the entire story, but they don't explain his character well enough or give him enough screen time to make a difference. He has a few very brief scenes throughout the entire movie which makes it difficult to keep up with - or care about - what's going on in his side-story. Which ultimately leads into my final complaint.I found that the lack of character progression became frustratingly annoying as the movie progressed. Not only that, but it seemed as if we were given little-to-no information on a great deal of the supporting cast. I would have loved to find out more about Keegan, but they didn't touch on his character's back-story at all. I guess we're supposed to assume that he's just another hitman, but part of me felt like there could have been much more to the character than that. Now part of this stems from seeing his reactions to certain things, but I also found myself curious as to why he was so angry and ruthless. Finally, I couldn't fight the feeling that no one really changed by the end of it all. Jimmy was still Jimmy and Taylor was still Taylor. Life went on and I doubt anyone made any changes in their life when it was all said and done.Finally, the casting and the film's score, composed by Steve Mazzaro, were both alright. While neither of them blew my mind, they got the job done and I guess that's all I could ask for. Stallone and Kang were probably the best out of the entire cast and I found myself surprised at how well they worked together on-screen. Aside from them, Mamoa was the only other standout, though. While his character didn't have a lot of dialogue, he seemed like the perfect fit for the stoic and ruthless Keegan. The score, on the other hand, was kind of hit and miss throughout the entire film. Some pieces worked really well while others could have been better. Not the best score I've heard all year, but I've definitely heard worse.Overall Score: 6.5/10 - When you really break it down, the biggest problem with Bullet to the Head is that it fails to do anything new. It draws inspiration from action films of old, but it doesn't do anything to differentiate itself from previous works. Not only that, but it's coupled with a sub-par cast, a mediocre score, and some poor character progression. While I don't regret taking the hour and a half to sit down and watch it, it's not something I can see myself watching again. If you had your eye on this when it was in theaters I would consider making it a rental.",3,6.5/10 - It's ok,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,4970,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Every', 'once', 'while', 'movie', 'where', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'articulating', 'how', 'felt', 'Well', 'Bullet', 'Head', 'one', 'films', 'out', 'swinging', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'final', 'piece', 'narration', 'spoken', 'Stallone', 'non-stop', 'action', 'film', 'fails', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'fact', 'even', 'try', 'Now', 'think', 'think', 'where', 'most', 'distaste', 'not', ""'m"", 'mindless', 'action', 'least', 'give', 'story', 'different', 'Give', 'something', 'substantial', 'Unfortunately', 'Bullet', 'Head', 'regards.You', 'follow', 'hitman', 'name', 'Jimmy', 'Bobo', 'Stallone', 'movie', 'partner', 'Louis', 'Jon', 'Seda', 'killing', 'corrupt', 'policeman', 'Jimmy', 'women', 'children', 'code', 'prostitute', 'Lola', 'Weronika', 'Rosati', 'alive', 'surprise', 'viewer', 'Lola', 'police', 'out-of-state', 'Washington', 'Police', 'Detective', 'Taylor', 'Kwon', 'Sung', 'Kang', 'Jimmy', 'Louis', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'killed', 'Greely', 'corrupt', 'policeman', 'Louis', 'killed', 'bar', 'Jimmy', 'duty', 'find', 'killer', 'Keegan', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'hooking', 'up', 'unlikely', 'accomplice', 'Detective', 'Kwon', 'mismatched', 'duo', 'soon', 'realize', 'need', 'other', 'wish', 'succeed', 'missions.If', 'had', 'narrow', 'down', 'biggest', 'issue', 'Bullet', 'Head', 'how', 'formulaic', 'give', 'little', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'then', 'firefight', 'more', 'dialogue', 'fistfight', 'then', 'rinse', 'repeat', 'movie', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'repetitiveness', 'feel', 'much', 'longer', 'actually', 'Not', 'only', 'only', 'few', 'action', 'sequences', 'feel', 'new', 'doing', 'anything', 'inventive', 'Most', 'time', 'firefights', 'hold', 'strong', 'similarities', 'action', 'films', 'past', 'only', 'down', 'experience', 'even', 'more', 'said', 'ax', 'fight', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'sequences', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'action', 'flick', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'feeling', 'extremely', 'scripted.Another', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'times', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'story', 'see', ""'re"", 'not', 'just', 'following', 'Jimmy', 'Taylor', 'also', 'corrupt', 'politician', 'South', 'America', 'named', 'Robert', 'Morel', 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaje', 'reality', 'kind', 'backbone', 'entire', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'explain', 'character', 'well', 'enough', 'give', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'make', 'difference', 'few', 'very', 'brief', 'scenes', 'entire', 'movie', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up', 'care', 'what', 'going', 'side-story', 'Which', 'ultimately', 'final', 'complaint.I', 'found', 'lack', 'character', 'progression', 'became', 'frustratingly', 'annoying', 'movie', 'progressed', 'Not', 'only', 'seemed', 'were', 'given', 'little-to-no', 'information', 'great', 'deal', 'supporting', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'Keegan', 'did', ""n't"", 'touch', 'character', 'back-story', 'guess', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'assume', 'just', 'hitman', 'part', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'Now', 'part', 'seeing', 'reactions', 'certain', 'things', 'also', 'found', 'curious', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'angry', 'ruthless', 'Finally', 'could', ""n't"", 'fight', 'feeling', 'one', 'really', 'changed', 'end', 'Jimmy', 'was', 'still', 'Jimmy', 'Taylor', 'was', 'still', 'Taylor', 'Life', 'went', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'made', 'changes', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done.Finally', 'casting', 'film', 'score', 'composed', 'Steve', 'Mazzaro', 'were', 'alright', 'blew', 'mind', 'got', 'job', 'done', 'guess', 'could', 'ask', 'Stallone', 'Kang', 'were', 'probably', 'best', 'entire', 'cast', 'found', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'worked', 'together', 'on-screen', 'Aside', 'Mamoa', 'was', 'only', 'other', 'standout', 'though', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'seemed', 'perfect', 'fit', 'stoic', 'ruthless', 'Keegan', 'score', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'kind', 'hit', 'miss', 'entire', 'film', 'pieces', 'worked', 'really', 'well', 'others', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Not', 'best', 'score', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'year', ""'ve"", 'definitely', 'heard', 'worse.Overall', 'Score', '6.5/10', 'When', 'really', 'break', 'down', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Bullet', 'Head', 'do', 'anything', 'new', 'inspiration', 'action', 'films', 'old', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'differentiate', 'previous', 'works', 'Not', 'only', 'coupled', 'sub-par', 'cast', 'mediocre', 'score', 'poor', 'character', 'progression', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'taking', 'hour', 'half', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'again', 'had', 'eye', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'would', 'consider', 'making', 'rental']",N/A

I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]Bullet to the Head - we own the Blu Ray, DVD, Ultraviolet Digital Copy editionMovie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):Bullet to the Head is an old-school sort of action flick.  Jimmy Bonomo aka ""Bobo"" is a not so nice guy who just happens to get himself into a lot ofboo-boos when he uncovers a deep plot involving politicians, mercenaries and worst of all, lawyers.  All he wanted to do was off this scumbag for money, and look what happens.  He ends up teamed with a cop and a beautiful young lady to try and get this whole mess taken care of.This film was essentially a no-brainer of fun.  There was some awesome action and a good amount of explosions.  Jason Momoa (Keegan, a hired man who really takes pride in serving up death on a stick), a real up and comer of the action genre, is a perfect compliment to Sly Stallone's skill and many years of experience.  It is like the old era meets the new era and puts a bullet in it.  The partnership of Bobo and Kwon provided some humor, though I have to say I never liked the cop.  Maybe I just like the bad guys?  Who knows...What I loved:The story was actually a little better put together than expected.The New Orleans style was all over the film.  It was pretty cool.The way that it ended.  I did not expect it to end quite like that.What I did NOT like:I was annoyed, at best, by Kwon.  I know buddy opposites work in films but this one, I don't know, at some points it felt forced.The marketing of this movie was non-existent.  I did not even know it had been made until I happened upon it as a new release on Amazon.Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

1499693,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B005S9EJS2,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[0, 1]","Sorry, kids, but the first thing that comes to mind in reviewing ""Bullet to the Head"" is how Stallone is aging and doing it well. My boomingness takes note of such things: skin is a bit crepy but muscles are fine-tuned, taunt, and distinct. No sag there! Since my gen is still making action movies (may I point out that Mick just turned 70?), I cannot avoid looking for and at the age factor.That said, ""Bullet to the Head"" is valid use of two hours. The most amazing scene is the axe fight. What? Stallone with an axe? The old man simply is not old. He fights the good fight and in this case, gets a little help.But I always get ahead of myself. Stallone plays a hit man, one world-weary, yet confident, strong, yet paired with a partner. And there presents the rub. The partner is offed during a double-cross and by a dirty, underhanded series of stabbings with a relentless blade. Being a man of loyalty, Jimmy Bobo (Stallone) must avenge his partner's death.A new pairing results. A New York detective goes to New Orleans to investigate the death of one of their own, a dirty cop. Why did he become corrupt and for whom? The uneasy pairing was not inspiring or logical. A cop bound to the letter of the law working with a hit man? It did not work for me. Nor did the particular actor, Sung Kang. (The pairing of Kathryn Heigel and Seth Rogan worked about as well.)After Stallone, the most effective actor is Jason Momoa as the assassin on the opposing side. Unlike Bobo, who kills for money, Momoa's characters kills for enjoyment. He's Dexter on steroids. Christian Slater plays a corrupt character with his usual breathy elegance. When the New York detective says he will make Slater talk by using psychology on him, Bobo proves the threat of torture will produce results in spades! It's a great, ironic scene!And no one is indispensable except Bobo, the detective, and Bobo's daughter. I expected tough girl stuff from her character, but was disappointed. She's just a girly girl covered in tats. However, for the ""bad guys,"" in a dark world of corruption and deal making, one's place in the universe is never secure.My biggest complaint (and a mild one) is that the New Orleans setting was not used to advantage. It was a prop, a city of corruption, a city just ripe ""for the taking."" Yuk!Overall, the movie held my attention. I was entertained. Did I learn anything new? Hmmm. If one is a hit man, be prepared to eliminate your living quarters if threatened by the enemy. But I already knew that from a Jason Statham movie.",4,"Stallone, dude!

After all, he's the star.  As far as I'm concerned this was,in certain ways one of his best films.There's a twist to this action film in that Stallone plays the ostensibly badcharacter--an assassin for hire.  As circumstances have it, he (reluctantly)pairs up with an Asian-American police detective (another loose sort ofassociation with Woo's film) to catch some especially bad guys, whokilled his co-worker.  So at the outset there's a tension at work: for thedetective. this is about solving a crime and catching the bad guys (of whichStallone himself is one), while for Stallone's character it's about revenge,and perhaps about making sure he's not next on someone's list....Sure, there's plenty of shooting, fighting, some nudity--everything you'dask for in an R-rated movie.  What there is also is Stallone deliveringsome of his funniest-ever lines in a movie.  Remember how he&#34;couldn't act&#34; [what they say about most male action stars] ?  Well,clearly there were some good script writers, but his delivery was alsospot-on.  For an action-suspense movie, this had me repeatedlybreaking up---all of it at Stallone's lines.

The first 10 minutes of the film were actually pretty good - but then, things went south, past Louisiana and even the American continent, straight towards Antarctica.The main culprit here is of course the scenario - or rather the lack of it (understandable - as we remember, it was eaten). Everything in this film can be anticipated, there is a complete lack of originality, dialogs are VERY lame, there is very little humour and let's not even talk about action scenes! In good action scenes the vilains (or the disposable sidekicks) make at least an effort and if possible put up a fight, offer a challenge, at least I don't know, show that they care a little about NOT dying - here, with just one exception, everybody dies immediately, the moment Stallone or Jason Momoa enter the room. That is not action, it is just boring slaughter.The idea of pairing up a hit man and a cop on a mission of revenge was very promising, but it was comprehensively FUBAR-ed. Part of responsability lays here with Sung Kang, the guy who plays the cop. This guy CAN'T act at all and his character is a laughable obscene abomination - I can't imagine how Walter Hill could accept such a lamo p-u-s-s-y as one of the two heroes of an action film. Honestly, if you want to see a film in which a hit man and a (former) cop team up in an uneasy alliance, see ""Best seller"", a 1987 movie with James Woods and Brian Dennehy - that is one bad@ss crime/action film!In fact, even if this film was adapted from a French graphic novel, Walter Hill tried to repeat here a little the same story as in his greatest hit, ""48 hours"" - but in this latter film he had a good scenario, two actors who could actually act and two vilains who were really scary dudes and put up a realistic big fight. In this film, not only the scenario is MIA but out of two heroes only Stallone makes an effort and the vilains are mostly laughable gun fodder. Christian Slater is completely wasted in this film (as he probably is most of the time in the real life) and the other vilain, played by British actor Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, is just a useless caricature, insanely stupid to the point of insulting and agravating permanently a 10-feet tall blue whale sized psychopatic killer, whom he doesn't control entirely...That leaves Jason Momoa, who actually tries to save this film a little - but he is not really allowed to play. I am certain however that he found the scenario completely indigest (remember - he ate part of it) as he painfully smiles a lot, trying to cover a painful grin...)))The scene of fight between Jason Momoa and Stallone characters is involuntarily funny. I really like Sly, even in his bad films, but he is now a senior citizen and the very idea of him going toe-to-toe against a colossus half his age and twice his size is pretty laughable - and in fact Jason Momoa clearly had to control himself strenuously not to puff...)))Amongst the very few good things in this film is the completely naked prostitute Lola who appears in the beginning of the film. She is pretty hot (good breasts, great butt) and she shows herself very generously to her public, but being Polish I particularly appreciated that she is played by Weronika Rosati, the daughter of our former minister of foreign affairs. Her dad must be so proud of her...)))I always liked Stallone, for many reasons, not the leaqt of which is that he is so much detested and mocked by cinema critics, pinko press and all the snotty Hollywood primadonnas. But honestly, this is a bad film, only for the most rabid Stallone's fans.

His base of operations - The Big Easy. A throwback film complete with noir-ish voice over narration and the seedy revelations of an ugly underbelly which polite society gracefully ignores. Jimmy and his partner in crime have just competed another successful job. But their upcoming payoff isn't what they were expecting. Instead, the assassins are themselves targeted for assassination.Beaten, bruised, but alive - he escapes his own contract. Unfortunately, his partner wasn't as fortunate. And now Jimmy's sincerely pissed. He's going to focus all his energies to find out why and to whom he will deliver retribution plus interest.And in a night where partners are lost, enter Detective Taylor Kwon. Turns out that the target of the original hit was his old ridealong, a disgraced officer recently fired for a multitude of professional and personal failings. As Kwon tracks down the murderers of his former partner, he realizes that the two deaths are connected. Now he wants a sit-down with Jimmy.Dialogue, characters, and plot were straight out of the Walter Hill catalog - comedic one liners and reasonably clever quips woven into a crime drama with two very mismatched partners. Not that that's a bad thing; nor is it particularly dated, since many modern filmmakers still trace this outline for their productions. But what this film lacked was a crisper script, one more attuned to the edgier and quicker pace of action flicks of today. Instead, 'Bullet' felt stodgy and sluggish in places, a bit too throwback.However, the grand final&eacute; of ""old school vs new school"" was wickedly fun. A pulse-pounding battle with bumboocha badass, Jason Momoa, as a private contractor who doesn't give a bleep about money. He delivered the goods despite his character having been mismanaged in the screenplay. A creative loss that could've and should've produced a stronger, more satisfying finish. The ""viking"" fight almost making up for 'Bullet's' other shortcomings.Almost.Overall, being amazed at Stallone's trademark cannons and physical conditioning was nearly worth the price of admission. So let's give credit where credit is due. It must take a helluva lot of work to look that ripped at an age where most of his chronological peers are settling down for retirement, early bird dinners, and a widening caboose. The man looked absolutely fantastic, easily passing for a decade younger than his birthdate.Loved that the co-star in 'Bullet' is asian. Believe it: I'm no mob-inspired, politically-correct, neo brown-shirt drone. In fact, I detest the mindless Huxleyian world sheeple have built for themselves in modern America. But just the fact that a non-caucasian was in a role that didn't involve martial arts or an organized crime family is damn near enough to call this movie a solid success.However, that incidental accolade aside, this flick was reasonably decent enough to pass an evening.Personal Notes:- If you're somehow able to get stunning and ridiculously delicious Sarah Shahi to do a nude scene, you maximize that to the absolute flipping max. What you don't do is wastefully execute the throwaway trope of walking-out-of-the-tub-and-briefly-dropping-the-towel bit. A sad and tragic loss.- Longtime director Walter Hill can still do some amazing work. Check out 'Undisputed' with Ving Rhames, Wesley Snipes, and the late great Peter Falk. An action flick favorite.Movie Note:- This year marks the return of Arnold to the big screen - and in keeping with their friendly feud - I would say this defeats Arnie's 'Last Stand', but only just barely.",3,Reasonably Decent Enough To Pass An Evening,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,3709,"['Not', 'bad', 'Better', 'was', 'expecting.Staged', 'functional', 'predictable', 'screenplay', 'Sly', 'James', 'Bonomo', 'contract', 'killer', 'base', 'operations', 'Big', 'Easy', 'A', 'throwback', 'film', 'complete', 'noir-ish', 'voice', 'narration', 'seedy', 'revelations', 'ugly', 'underbelly', 'polite', 'society', 'gracefully', 'Jimmy', 'partner', 'crime', 'have', 'just', 'competed', 'successful', 'job', 'upcoming', 'payoff', ""n't"", 'what', 'were', 'expecting', 'Instead', 'assassins', 'are', 'targeted', 'assassination.Beaten', 'bruised', 'alive', 'own', 'contract', 'Unfortunately', 'partner', 'was', ""n't"", 'fortunate', 'now', 'Jimmy', 'sincerely', 'pissed', 'going', 'focus', 'energies', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'whom', 'will', 'deliver', 'retribution', 'interest.And', 'night', 'where', 'partners', 'are', 'lost', 'enter', 'Detective', 'Taylor', 'Kwon', 'out', 'target', 'original', 'hit', 'was', 'old', 'ridealong', 'disgraced', 'officer', 'recently', 'fired', 'multitude', 'professional', 'personal', 'failings', 'Kwon', 'down', 'murderers', 'former', 'partner', 'two', 'deaths', 'are', 'connected', 'Now', 'sit-down', 'Jimmy.Dialogue', 'characters', 'plot', 'were', 'straight', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'catalog', 'comedic', 'one', 'liners', 'reasonably', 'clever', 'quips', 'woven', 'crime', 'drama', 'two', 'very', 'mismatched', 'partners', 'Not', 'bad', 'thing', 'particularly', 'dated', 'many', 'modern', 'filmmakers', 'still', 'trace', 'outline', 'productions', 'what', 'film', 'lacked', 'was', 'crisper', 'script', 'one', 'more', 'attuned', 'edgier', 'quicker', 'pace', 'action', 'flicks', 'today', 'Instead', 'felt', 'stodgy', 'sluggish', 'places', 'bit', 'too', 'throwback.However', 'grand', 'final', 'eacute', 'old', 'school', 'vs', 'new', 'school', 'was', 'wickedly', 'fun', 'pulse-pounding', 'battle', 'bumboocha', 'badass', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'private', 'contractor', 'who', ""n't"", 'give', 'bleep', 'money', 'delivered', 'goods', 'character', 'having', 'been', 'mismanaged', 'screenplay', 'creative', 'loss', 'could', ""'ve"", 'should', ""'ve"", 'produced', 'stronger', 'more', 'satisfying', 'finish', 'viking', 'fight', 'almost', 'making', 'up', ""'Bullet"", 'other', 'shortcomings.Almost.Overall', 'being', 'amazed', 'Stallone', 'trademark', 'cannons', 'physical', 'conditioning', 'was', 'nearly', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'So', 'let', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'must', 'take', 'helluva', 'lot', 'work', 'look', 'ripped', 'age', 'where', 'most', 'chronological', 'peers', 'are', 'settling', 'down', 'retirement', 'early', 'bird', 'dinners', 'widening', 'caboose', 'man', 'looked', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'easily', 'passing', 'decade', 'younger', 'birthdate.Loved', 'co-star', ""'Bullet"", 'asian', 'Believe', ""'m"", 'mob-inspired', 'politically-correct', 'neo', 'brown-shirt', 'drone', 'fact', 'detest', 'mindless', 'Huxleyian', 'world', 'sheeple', 'have', 'built', 'modern', 'America', 'just', 'fact', 'non-caucasian', 'was', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'involve', 'martial', 'arts', 'organized', 'crime', 'family', 'damn', 'near', 'enough', 'call', 'movie', 'solid', 'success.However', 'incidental', 'accolade', 'aside', 'flick', 'was', 'reasonably', 'decent', 'enough', 'pass', 'evening.Personal', 'Notes', ""'re"", 'somehow', 'able', 'get', 'stunning', 'ridiculously', 'delicious', 'Sarah', 'Shahi', 'do', 'nude', 'scene', 'maximize', 'absolute', 'flipping', 'max', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'wastefully', 'execute', 'throwaway', 'trope', 'walking-out-of-the-tub-and-briefly-dropping-the-towel', 'bit', 'sad', 'tragic', 'loss.-', 'Longtime', 'director', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'can', 'still', 'do', 'amazing', 'work', 'Check', 'out', ""'Undisputed"", 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'late', 'great', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'action', 'flick', 'favorite.Movie', 'Note', 'year', 'return', 'Arnold', 'big', 'screen', 'keeping', 'friendly', 'feud', 'would', 'say', 'Arnie', ""'Last"", 'Stand', 'only', 'just', 'barely']",N/A

In this action thriller he plays an assassin (naturally one with a code) who is double crossed after a hit. He teams up with a cop to find who set him up, it turns into a bit of a buddy movie at that point.The action is good and considering his age Stallone still has some good moves (I know good camera work helps, so don't burst my bubble!), it's fast paced from start to finish. The humour isn't quite as strong, there's continued sparring between the two leads which for the most part works, but occasionally falls a bit flat.A good action film needs a suitable bad guy and Jason Momoa provides just that, he's not the head honcho, more the muscle. He has the bulk and the moves and while he has the warrior look, he doesn't quite make the bad guy in this. I can't quite put my finger on why, I think it's because it looks like he's having fun all the way through it.Still that is forgiven for the end fight, there needs to be more battles with axes.

It's a good, solid movie with professional efforts by both its star, Sylvester Stallone, and its director, Walter Hill. Hill has built a career on filming great action based thrillers that involve the protagonist struggling against seemingly insurmountable odds. This one is no different. Stallone plays a professional hitman who marches to the beat of his own drummer. He's so good at assuming this role that you forget he's acting. He remains perhaps one of the most underrated actors of our time. He looks the part, too, being in fantastic physical shape. Hill's movies are essentially buddy flicks, and this time Stallone is paired with Sung Kang, who plays an NYPD detective sent to the Big Easy to run down a case. The two are uneasy partners at first, mirroring the tension Hill gave to the pairing of the cop and the convict in 48 Hours, but eventually develop a mutual respect for each other. Like all Walter Hill movies there is plenty of action which sets the stage for the climax where Stallone and the formidable bad guy go toe-to-toe in a fight to the finish. Some might call it predictable, but it's masterfully done. It harkens back to an era when movies were about characters and story instead of mindless special effects and CGI images designed to hide the thinness of the plot.

He still has the moves and his demeanor is pure kick-ass.His real nemesis is Jason Momoa as Keegan, and he is also in good shape,but much younger of course.While Stallone's character's moves are street driven,Momoa's,according to his background,is much in the military vein.When the action comes,little or no punches are pulled and it gets hot pretty quick.I suppose the major drawback here is the meandering plot,which drifts from one scene to the next and drags the story along with it.The spectacular fights seemed staged to draw your attention away from the weaknesses.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette on the making of the film.All in all,despite the weaknesses,I liked the film.Stallone is certainly the box office draw,but his screen partners also get lots of time to shine themselves.I think it an average to above average film,nicely watched on a Friday with some popcorn and the one you love beside you.3- 3 1/2 stars.",4,Testosterone fueled action romp!,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,4581,"['Bullet', 'Head', 'released', 'Nov/12', 'stars', 'others', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'James', 'Bobo',

His latest retread of glory's past, it seriously looks like a  movie that he has already made. The fact that it is directed by the legendary Walter Hill, one of my personal favorite filmmakers makes this all the more depressing. Like Sly, Hill is doing a retread of film's past, in his case 48HRS. or Red Heat, and looking seriously old and out of touch by doing soIt all begins exciting enough with a bullet shooting it`s way through the Warner Bros. and Dark Castle logos. Alas, this is where the inspired filmmaking abruptly ends and the generic script begins.Stallone stars as Jimmy Bobo, a black suit clad hitman. Who with his partner Louis (Jon Seda) are double crossed by their employers. Louis is killed and Bobo vows revenge. A D.C. Korean-American cop named Taylor Kwan (Sung Kang) is looking for the same guys as Stallone, so the two form a problematic partnership.Stallone is still a good action star, and assumes this anti-hero noir hero role well. Kang is an amiable screen presence, best known for his work as Han in three of the Fast and the Furious movies. But together they have no chemistry, they are simply mismatched and not just in the film sense.Playing Bullet to the Head's chief heavy is Jason Momoa. Obviously cast because somebody was under the misguided belief that Conan the Barbarian was gonna make him a superstar. But he is no star, he is a terrible actor who looks like he may be able to grunt his lines. He has no charisma to speak of either. He isn't menacing, just kind of stupid looking. And he really does make Stallone look like Brando by comparison.In all fairness, there are a few inspired moments though like when we get to see Sly's mug shots through the ages, we get to watch him age in front of our eyes, going from Death Race 200-era to possibly the Expendables 2. We also have a nice bluesy soundtrack score by Steve Mazzaro. Bullet to the Head also looks great, the visual style is awesome, the only thing to let us know that Hill wasn't asleep in his director's chair. The scenes of Louisiana after dark are great too, filled with beautiful nourish style.Bullet to the Head is a movie with a lot of good things about it, but it is by no means a good movie. It is more a sad stroll down memory lane than a new chapter in anyone's film legacy. Stallone and Hill can pretend no time has passed since they were stars, but they are fooling no one, least of all  anyone who cares, meaning there fans.Bullet to the Head is loaded with extreme violence and plentiful female nudity.  But still manages to be boring. It's just so darn familiar and incredibly routine, it's also slow moving and dull to boot. The whole moving seems to be on autopilot with one terrible worn out clich&eacute; followed by another. We the audience know where this movie is headed every step of the way with few if any surprises coming along the way.It all plays out like a movie that is decades out of date. And even it were not so, it would not have been one of Stallone's or Hill's best by a long stretch.The screenplay is by Alessandro Camon and it is based on a graphic novel titled ""Du Plomb dans la tete"" which is by Alexis Nolent, if the novel is anything like the screenplay it is uninspired and filled to capacity with clich&eacute;s. Stallone as a hitman who doesn't work with cops and gives us a whole speech about how he kills  ""no woman, no children"". Sly's sense of humor is anything but, at least in this movie. There is a lot of dumb dialogue, lame jokes about ""old school"" antics and a string of truly lousy unfunny ethnic jokes.There are a lot of scenes with Stallone and Kang pointing there guns at each other. And poor Sly is saddled with the stupidest name of any of his characters before. Combined with a plot point that seems significant, the meaning of the tattoo shared by both his daughter and the Russian hooker, but is never revealed, serves as nothing more than a time waster.  Bullet to the Head is actually a notch or two below a lot of direct-to-DVD movies that have starred Van Damme, Lundgren, Snipes, Berenger, Seagal and the like.It has been well publicized that this was not a happy production. The original director was Wayne Kramer (the Cooler, Running Scared), who apparently clashed with Stallone and was quickly replaced. Then the film's original co-lead, Thomas Jane, was abruptly let go by the producers. Hill didn't finish the movie. Producer Joel Silver just ended his long partnership with the WB after decades of calling them home, and leaving behind such lucrative franchises as Lethal Weapon, the Matrix and the Robert Downey, Jr. Sherlock Holmes movies. Add to that the fact that Bullet to the Head has been gathering dust sitting on a shelf for almost a year, it even still carries a 2012 copyright.Hill is a director who I have always admired. Bullet to the Head marks his first theatrical work in over a decade. Until now he had made very few bad movies, but Bullet to the Head joins the ranks of Brewster's Millions and Another 48 HRS. as the only films from the maestro that I have to give a flunking grade too. Coming just weeks after Arnold Schwarzenegger's big screen flop the Last Stand, I am starting to sense a trend here, one that makes these old timers truly once and for all expendable.see my reviews at

1499760,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B005S9EJS2,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[0, 0]","Let's get another thing out of the way too: if you like Sylvester Stallone's oeuvre of film then you'll like this a good deal too.  Here Sly plays an age-defying hitman whose partner is offed in a bar by actor Jason Mamoa (Conan the Barbarian), playing the lead villain looking like a clean-cut grizzly bear.  Why does he do this?  Who cares!  Because he does what he needs to do in playing the sadistic but idealistic bad guy antagonist to Stallone's protagonist making Sly look the part of the underdog (dude is short but staunch while Mamoa is tall and double-wide at the shoulders) and making us wonder why more fights don't come down to two gnarly dudes duking it out in big warehouses with fire axes more often?My review so far may sound a little tongue-in-cheek and it's meant to.  Part of the fun of this movie is its throwback to Stallone's machismo big screen glory days where in every film the camera got closer up and closer up to his face.  The camera does pull back more in this film, partly because it allows the other characters (the upright cop, Sly's bodacious daughter, Mamoa, and a few other bit players) their time to shine.  The movie has a few moments of excitement, is appropriately R-rated brutal and bloody with a dash of nudity and sexuality and course language, and enough grit in its two main mean men to raise a dude's level of testosterone while they watch it.  But it is also largely recycled plot points and straightforward story telling.  Take it for what it's worth.  It's a good enough time and you'll remember that final fight and maybe a few other things about the movie but in the end it's interchangeable with a good many other films.  3.5 stars.",3,Let's get one thing out of the way up front: Sly looks amazing for his age!,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,1686,"['Let', 'get', 'thing', 'way', 'too', 'like', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'oeuvre', 'film', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'good', 'deal', 'too', 'Here', 'Sly', 'age-defying', 'hitman', 'partner', 'offed', 'bar', 'actor', 'Jason', 'Mamoa', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'playing', 'lead', 'villain', 'looking', 'clean-cut', 'grizzly', 'bear', 'Why', 'do', 'Who', 'what', 'do', 'playing', 'sadistic', 'idealistic', 'bad', 'guy', 'antagonist', 'Stallone', 'protagonist', 'making', 'Sly', 'look', 'part', 'underdog', 'dude', 'short', 'staunch', 'Mamoa', 'tall', 'double-wide', 'shoulders', 'making', 'wonder', 'why', 'more', 'fights', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'down', 'two', 'gnarly', 'dudes', 'duking', 'out', 'big', 'warehouses', 'fire', 'axes', 'more', 'often', 'My', 'review', 'so', 'far', 'may', 'sound', 'little', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'meant', 'Part', 'fun', 'movie', 'throwback', 'Stallone', 'machismo', 'big', 'screen', 'glory', 'days', 'where', 'film', 'camera', 'got', 'closer', 'up', 'closer', 'up', 'face', 'camera', 'pull', 'back', 'more', 'film', 'partly', 'other', 'characters', 'upright', 'cop', 'Sly', 'bodacious', 'daughter', 'Mamoa', 'few', 'other', 'bit', 'players', 'time', 'shine', 'movie', 'few', 'moments', 'excitement', 'appropriately', 'R-rated', 'brutal', 'bloody', 'dash', 'nudity', 'sexuality', 'course', 'language', 'enough', 'grit', 'two', 'main', 'mean', 'men', 'raise', 'dude', 'level', 'testosterone', 'watch', 'also', 'largely', 'recycled', 'plot', 'points', 'straightforward', 'story', 'telling', 'Take', 'what', 'worth', 'good', 'enough', 'time', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'final', 'fight', 'maybe', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'movie', 'end', 'interchangeable', 'good', 'many', 'other', 'films', '3.5', 'stars']",N/A
1499761,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B005S9EJS2,Tim Janson,"[1, 1]","Walter Hill has been one of the best directors of gritty action films for forty years.  He&#8217;s helmed such movies as The Driver (1978), The Warriors (1979), Southern Comfort (1981), Red Heat (1988), Last Man Standing (1996), and Undisputed (2002).  With Bullet to the Head, Hill returns to the odd couple comedy/ action film he made most famous with 48 Hours in 1982, but with mixed results.Hill recycles the cop and convict team-up formula that pairs Stallone as aging hitman Jimmy Bobo, with Washington D.C. Detective Taylor Kwon (Kang).  In New Orleans, Bobo and his partner Louis have completed a hit on a corrupt cop who was Kwon&#8217;s former partner.  While celebrating at a bar, Louis is killed by another hitman named Keegan (Mamoa).  Kwon &#8216;s investigation leads him to Bobo where the two form an uneasy alliance to find out who wanted the cop dead and who killed Louis.Fairly standard fare for movies of this type and left to those ends, Bullet to the Head might have been an enjoyable homage to those 1980&#8217;s action films whose fire Hill is clearly trying to rekindle.  Unfortunately his choppy direction and the muddled script of Alessandro Camon, weighs down the script with far too many bad guys and plot elements.  A corrupt businessman Robert Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), his shyster lawyer Marcus Baptiste (Christian Slater), and a local mob boss named Baby Jack, not to mention Mamoa&#8217;s character, all leave you wondering who the heck is the real antagonist.In 48 hours you had wonderful comic interplay between Nick Nolte, who was a strong actor, and Eddie Murphy who is a great comedian.  Bullet to the Head unfortunately has neither.  Outside of a few chuck-inducing deadpan one-liners from Stallone, the comedy bits come off far too forced.  When the two characters are not saving each other&#8217;s lives, they are threatening to kill each other in increasing hostile and unfunny ways.For Mamoa, who enjoyed a short but memorable run in Game of Thrones, Bullet to the Head marks his first feature film since the disastrous Conan the Barbarian.  He seems far more comfortable in this supporting role where he doesn&#8217;t have to carry the action.  And frankly, he makes a much better villain anyway.Of course an action film has to come down to the final battle between hero and villains and you have to at least give Walter points for originality for the film&#8217;s climactic fight.  In The Warriors, it was a duel with baseball bats between The Warriors and the baseball uniform-wearing Furies.  Here, Bobo and Keegan square off with fireman&#8217;s axes in an abandoned warehouse.  And you have to give credit for Stallone as well who at 67 years of age, holds his own with Mamoa who is half his age.There&#8217;s no doubt that some thirty years after his prime as an action film star Stallone is still a commanding presence on the screen.  But while he was teamed with a host of diverse personalities in the two Expendables films, Sung Kang simply isn&#8217;t strong enough or charismatic enough to take the load off Sly.Blu-Ray ReviewsMayhem, Inc.

I was a little surprised to know they had never worked together before, but anyway I thought ""Bullet To The Head"" would be a great opportunity for their belated collaboration. About 20 minutes in, however, I began to feel something was not quite right with the result. Sylvester Stallone looks great as a contract killer with his own set of ethics. Sung Kang as a strait-laced Washington D.C detective is not bad.Perhaps it is the weak storyline that is to be blamed. Here is a time-tested ""48 Hrs."" buddy movie formula, but Walter Hill fails to make full use of the premise of the mismatched duo. Sung Kang's detective takes out his BlackBerry and locates their next ""target."" Old school killer Stallone is not impressed. A few amusing one-liners. The two arrive at the destination, do what they do, and go on to the next place. There is not much chemistry between them, no real surprise about what they can do, or cannot.When a beautiful tattoo artist Lisa (Sarah Shahi) steps in, I thought finally the film was going to do something different. I was wrong as she was just another plot device.  Walter Hill never gives a chance to be interesting to the supporting players including Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Jason Momoa and Christian Slater. I don't know anything about the French graphic novel by Alexis Nolent upon which the film is based. I don't know why the filmmakers were attracted to the source material, either.To be fair, the action scenes are decent and Stallone's performance is compelling.

Yes, I know: there are times when Stallone can be extremely annoying to me with some of his action films (The Expendables comes immediately to mind).  But, in the end, I actually kind of liked Bullet to the Head.  I actually like a good, mindless action film as long as it doesn't get too incredibly stupid and as long as the acting is halfway decent.  That pretty much describes Bullet to the Head for me.  Stallone does well with his role here as a nearly impervious assassin hellbent on revenge. That is as it should be in this all-too-familiar type of anti-hero type genre; the badass assassin who doesn't give a rip about anybody or anything let alone something like rules and laws and all of that kind of useless nonsense.  That's what anti-heroes are all about: being a badass.  So, having said that and understanding that, you will be treated to an hour and a half of decent, mindless entertainment where a lot of people are getting killed in sometimes interesting ways. This is just pure popcorn entertainment fare here, folks; not Citizen Kane.  This is Dirty Harry turf here; just not as good.  Still, Stallone can deliver his little short snarky lines with great comic timing with that one-of-a-kind adenoidal Stallone voice. Stallone's muscles are still there, just in a more ropey and somewhat wrinkly format these days.  Even so, would that most of us his age had even a minute portion of those ropes.Anyway, all I can say is that I was pleasantly surprised by Bullet to the Head, but not surprised surprised, if that makes any kind of sense.  I enjoyed it.  I'll probably watch it again at some point.  Which brings up an interesting point--if not dilemma--for me personally.  There are a number of films that are far, far greater than movies like Bullet to the Head; movies that I will probably never watch again.  &#34;Precious&#34; comes to mind here, as just one example of this dilemma.  &#34;Precious&#34; was a film of enormous impact on me as a film goer.  It rattled me to the bone.  It haunts me still when I think of it.  It was a masterpiece.  And yet, I never want to see it again; or, at least for a very long time.  On the other hand, I will probably wind up watching Bullet to the Head and other shallow, entertainment only movies like it a number of times.  Perhaps I am just shallow; perhaps even a little jaded or mentally challenged or something.  Whatever.  I like being entertained and action movies like this often serve that purpose better for me than many of the more &#34;serious&#34; movies like Precious.  That doesn't mean I won't see those &#34;more important&#34; and &#34;better&#34; movies; it just means that when it comes to repeated viewings, I often prefer the more &#34;shallow&#34; stuff.  So be it.But this review is about Bullet to the Head which is probably not even deserving of all of this verbiage, so let me cut to the chase: if you like action movies involving a lot of mayhem and shootings and such, watch it.  If you prefer more refined entertainment, skip it.",3,"There's no intelligence here, simply pure and simple mindless and often fun action",1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,3108,"['Bullet', 'Head', 'pure', 'Stallone', 'turf', 'here', 'mean', 'best', 'sense', 'Yes', 'know', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Stallone', 'can', 'be', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'action', 'films', 'Expendables', 'immediately', 'mind', 'end', 'actually', 'kind', 'liked', 'Bullet', 'Head', 'actually', 'good', 'mindless', 'action', 'film', 'as', 'long', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'as', 'long', 'acting', 'halfway', 'decent', 'pretty', 'much', 'describes', 'Bullet', 'Head', 'Stallone', 'well', 'role', 'here', 'nearly', 'impervious', 'assassin', 'hellbent', 'revenge', 'should', 'be', 'all-too-familiar', 'type', 'anti-hero', 'type', 'genre', 'badass', 'assassin', 'who', ""n't"", 'give', 'rip', 'anybody', 'anything', 'let', 'alone', 'something', 'rules', 'laws', 'kind', 'useless', 'nonsense', 'what', 'anti-heroes', 'are', 'being', 'badass', 'So', 'having', 'said', 'understanding', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'hour', 'half', 'decent', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'where', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'getting', 'killed', 'sometimes', 'interesting', 'ways', 'just', 'pure', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', 'fare', 'here', 'folks', 'not', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'turf', 'here', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Still', 'Stallone', 'can', 'deliver', 'little', 'short', 'snarky', 'lines', 'great', 'comic', 'timing', 'one-of-a-kind', 'adenoidal', 'Stallone', 'voice', 'Stallone', 'muscles', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'just', 'more', 'ropey', 'somewhat', 'wrinkly', 'format', 'days', 'Even', 'so', 'would', 'most', 'age', 'had', 'even', 'minute', 'portion', 'ropes.Anyway', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Bullet', 'Head', 'not', 'surprised', 'surprised', 'kind', 'sense', 'enjoyed', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'point', 'up', 'interesting', 'point', 'not', 'dilemma', 'personally', 'are', 'number', 'films', 'are', 'far', 'far', 'greater', 'movies', 'Bullet', 'Head', 'movies', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'watch', 'again', '34', 'Precious', '34', 'mind', 'here', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'dilemma', '34', 'Precious', '34', 'was', 'film', 'enormous', 'impact', 'film', 'goer', 'rattled', 'bone', 'still', 'when', 'think', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'yet', 'never', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'least', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'other', 'hand', 'will', 'probably', 'wind', 'up', 'watching', 'Bullet', 'Head', 'other', 'shallow', 'entertainment', 'only', 'movies', 'number', 'times', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'just', 'shallow', 'perhaps', 'even', 'little', 'jaded', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'something', 'being', 'entertained', 'action', 'movies', 'often', 'serve', 'purpose', 'better', 'many', 'more', '34', 'serious', '34', 'movies', 'Precious', ""n't"", 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', '34', 'more', 'important', '34', '34', 'better', '34', 'movies', 'just', 'when', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'often', 'prefer', 'more', '34', 'shallow', '34', 'stuff', 'So', 'be', 'it.But', 'review', 'Bullet', 'Head', 'probably', 'not', 'even', 'deserving', 'verbiage', 'so', 'let', 'cut', 'chase', 'like', 'action', 'movies', 'involving', 'lot', 'mayhem', 'shootings', 'such', 'watch', 'prefer', 'more', 'refined', 'entertainment', 'skip']",N/A

For example, Slater's character gives an ENORMOUS info dump during an interrogation--info no criminal would give so freely, in so many sentences, and with so much clarification and explanation.  It is laughable!  Worse, he gives up all this crucial info. after Stallone hits him . . . ONCE!!!!  LOL.  Ridiculous.Then the writers try to make a big deal out of the old assassin's lack of reliance on technology, like cell phones.  The cop gets info from it.  Wow!  Big deal.  He gets info by USING it to contact other cops!!!!  No assassin is going to have access to databases unless they are hacked.  Yet, the story drops it and it goes nowhere.  The assassin does not gradually ease into its use and then suddenly use it at a key moment in the plot.  Nothing unique develops.When the movie turns violent, the action is satisfying.  But . . . there is not enough action.  When the cop actually gets to fight, it is way too late in the movie to care.  Yet he has skills!  In my opinion, these two guys should have been put up aginst an army of bad guys.  Instead the movie limps between action scenes.  Just enough action to keep you watching.I will say, though, that Momoa STEALS the movie at least as much as Stallone.  I never expected much from him--I was WRONG!  He is an excellent actor as well as an excellent villainous action star.  Every time he arrived on camera, you feared what was going to go down.  Nice!  His action scenes with Stallone are the best in the movie--by far!The relationship between the cop and the assassin is not developed.  In fact, if Stallone's character had simply killed the cop and forged ahead, the movie would not suffer.  Another annoying part of this film is the spontaneous relationship between the tattoo artist and the cop.  Why?  For what?  It has no purpose.In fact, the weakest aspect of this movie is the characterization.  It's frustrating to see excellent actors given cardboard cut-out parts.  As a viewer, you relate to the actor more than the character because the movie gives you basically nothing to admire, despise, contemplate, about them as people.  Such a common Hollywood writing failure.  The movie and the actors deserved more.  Add thirty minutes, for the gods' sakes!!!DO NOT BUY.  (Like I did.)  :(  But definitely rent it.  It's a decent action movie.",3,Mediocre But Satisfyingly Violent,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,2430,"['Well', 'movie', 'nothing', 'special', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'boring', 'insultingly', 'basic', 'example', 'Slater', 'character', 'ENORMOUS', 'info', 'dump', 'interrogation', 'info', 'criminal', 'would', 'give', 'so', 'freely', 'so', 'many', 'sentences', 'so', 'much', 'clarification', 'explanation', 'laughable', 'Worse', 'up', 'crucial', 'info', 'Stallone', 'ONCE', 'LOL', 'Ridiculous.Then', 'writers', 'try', 'make', 'big', 'deal', 'old', 'assassin', 'lack', 'reliance', 'technology', 'cell', 'phones', 'cop', 'info', 'Wow', 'Big', 'deal', 'info', 'USING', 'contact', 'other', 'cops', 'assassin', 'going', 'have', 'access', 'databases', 'are', 'hacked', 'story', 'nowhere', 'assassin', 'not', 'gradually', 'ease', 'use', 'then', 'suddenly', 'use', 'key', 'moment', 'plot', 'Nothing', 'unique', 'movie', 'violent', 'action', 'satisfying', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'When', 'cop', 'actually', 'fight', 'way', 'too', 'late', 'movie', 'care', 'skills', 'opinion', 'two', 'guys', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'up', 'army', 'bad', 'guys', 'Instead', 'movie', 'action', 'scenes', 'Just', 'enough', 'action', 'keep', 'watching.I', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'Momoa', 'STEALS', 'movie', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'Stallone', 'never', 'expected', 'much', 'was', 'WRONG', 'excellent', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'villainous', 'action', 'star', 'time', 'arrived', 'camera', 'feared', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'down', 'Nice', 'action', 'scenes', 'Stallone', 'are', 'best', 'movie', 'far', 'relationship', 'cop', 'assassin', 'not', 'developed', 'fact', 'Stallone', 'character', 'had', 'simply', 'killed', 'cop', 'forged', 'ahead', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'suffer', 'annoying', 'part', 'film', 'spontaneous', 'relationship', 'tattoo', 'artist', 'cop', 'Why', 'what', 'purpose.In', 'fact', 'weakest', 'aspect', 'movie', 'characterization', 'frustrating', 'see', 'excellent', 'actors', 'given', 'cardboard', 'cut-out', 'parts', 'viewer', 'relate', 'actor', 'more', 'character', 'movie', 'basically', 'nothing', 'admire', 'despise', 'contemplate', 'about', 'people', 'common', 'Hollywood', 'writing', 'failure', 'movie', 'actors', 'deserved', 'more', 'Add', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'gods', 'sakes', 'DO', 'NOT', 'BUY', 'did', 'definitely', 'rent', 'decent', 'action', 'movie']",N/A
