She's nuts about all the DVDs we own (and so am I), but not this one.  I found it quite lame, corny (Barney is supposed to be corny, not Sesame Street) and boring.  Too many ""people"" in it with ""people"" skits interrupting Muppet skits.  Sesame Street is nothing without the Muppets, so I found this DVD was filled with a lot of filler.  With such high hopes for this one, it was only worth it for the Disco Grover skit which was worth 2 stars.

I was thrilled because after a few minutes I wasn't sure that I could've sat through it anyway. We were very disappointed. I tried it again a month or so later (making her 16 months) and she enjoyed it. The more she watched it, the more it grew on me. Now we sing the songs and really get a kick out of the video.",4,Give it a chance!,1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,383,"['first', 'time', 'put', 'one', 'daughter', 'walked', 'away', 'TV', 'was', 'thrilled', 'because', 'few', 'minutes', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'could', ""'ve"", 'sat', 'anyway', 'were', 'very', 'disappointed', 'tried', 'again', 'month', 'so', 'later', 'making', '16', 'months', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'watched', 'more', 'grew', 'Now', 'sing', 'songs', 'really', 'get', 'kick', 'video']",N/A

They LOVE to dance and sing and LOVE Sesame Street, so I'm thinking &#34;win-win&#34;, right?  Not so fast.  While they do enjoy the video, it's over in like 20 minutes.  So unbelievably disappointing.  Bear in mind, as well, that this video is REALLY old.  Early 1970's old.  That's from MY childhood.  Not saying there's anything wrong with that.

There are a few bits that can be from 1969 (the disco scene, obviously!), but the live action scenes were from the 80's, judging by the way the clothes look.It's a nice video and my daughter seems to like it.
