I love Gabrielle Union, so I'll watch her in anything, but it's a shame that things like this get made without any real style.  Substance can, at times, be substituted if there is some spunk, some sharpness involved, but this film is just kind of bland.

This character was a bit unbearable to watch.  Extremely bossy, nosey, meddlesome, cruel, nasty, obnoxious characters such as this was not amusing for me.  It may seem funny to watch for some, but there are actual people that treat others like this.  The worst thing a person can do is let others run their lives.  It doesn't matter if its a family member, which could be more devastating.Sure they were poking fun at relationships such as this, but it became overbearing.  The sisters depended on each other for support, but there has to be a line drawn.  It was apparent that Eva was an unhappy person, and her sister's felt compelled to give her their support. It was obvious, that they were getting a little tired of her behavior as well.  It seems as though they did not want to hurt her feelings.  But again, there has to be a line drawn.

601190,A3H1PU959E7MXG,B00005JLI6,"clarence a connelly, jr.","[0, 0]","The movie &#34;Deliver Us From Eva&#34; has a very good cast including Gabrielle Union, LL Cool J, Duane Martin, Essence Atkins and others.  The plot is pretty straight forward as some men involved in relationships need to have Evageline Dandridge out of their way so that their relationships can progress without her heavy duty controlling of her sister's lives.  Eva has strong opinions about men and never hesitates to voice these opinions much to the chagrin of the men and the women involved.  The men come up with the idea of getting someone to date Eva to take her mind off of their and their women's lives.  Enter LL Cool J who is basically a playboy who loves women and leaves them.  It should be noted that Eva controls the purse strings of a trust so the sisters are sort of under her control.Naturally in this case, the LL Cool J character, Raymond, falls for Eva in a big way and cannot dump her which was the plan.  When she moves to Chicago from LA for a new job, he even pursues her to tell her he actually does love her.  They ride off into the sunset in Chicago together.The unfortunate part of the film is the fake funeral that the men plan after kidnapping Ray and keeping him tied up in an abandoned warehouse because they believe that he has double crossed them by not dumping Eva as was the original deal.This part of the movie keeps the movie from being better than it is.  Therefore, I would say that seventy five per cent of the movie is fine but twenty five per cent of it is very weak.  Oh well, you cannot have everything.There are no surprises in the movie and everything that happens is pretty much predictable.  The cast is fine and very good looking,  the script is okay except for the aforementioned funeral scene.  All in all, I liked the movie and a lot of people will enjoy it.  It is what it is, a romantic comedy featuring a mostly Black cast.  Not nearly as good as &#34;The Best Man&#34; but worth the time and money to watch and enjoy.",4,A Super Cast and a Good Premise Make for Enjoyable Viewing,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,1977,"['movie', '34', 'Deliver', 'Us', 'From', 'Eva', '34', 'very', 'good', 'cast', 'including', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'Essence', 'Atkins', 'others', 'plot', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'men', 'involved', 'relationships', 'need', 'have', 'Evageline', 'Dandridge', 'way', 'relationships', 'can', 'progress', 'heavy', 'duty', 'controlling', 'sister', 'lives', 'Eva', 'strong', 'opinions', 'men', 'never', 'hesitates', 'voice', 'opinions', 'much', 'chagrin', 'men', 'women', 'involved', 'men', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'getting', 'someone', 'date', 'Eva', 'take', 'mind', 'women', 'lives', 'Enter', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'who', 'basically', 'playboy', 'who', 'women', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Eva', 'purse', 'strings', 'trust', 'so', 'sisters', 'are', 'sort', 'control.Naturally', 'case', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'character', 'Raymond', 'Eva', 'big', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'dump', 'was', 'plan', 'When', 'Chicago', 'LA', 'new', 'job', 'even', 'tell', 'actually', 'love', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'Chicago', 'together.The', 'unfortunate', 'part', 'film', 'fake', 'funeral', 'men', 'plan', 'kidnapping', 'Ray', 'keeping', 'tied', 'up', 'abandoned', 'warehouse', 'believe', 'double', 'crossed', 'not', 'dumping', 'Eva', 'was', 'original', 'deal.This', 'part', 'movie', 'movie', 'being', 'better', 'Therefore', 'would', 'say', 'seventy', 'five', 'cent', 'movie', 'fine', 'twenty', 'five', 'cent', 'very', 'weak', 'Oh', 'well', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'are', 'surprises', 'movie', 'everything', 'pretty', 'much', 'predictable', 'cast', 'fine', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'script', 'okay', 'aforementioned', 'funeral', 'scene', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'what', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'featuring', 'mostly', 'Black', 'cast', 'Not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', '34', 'Best', 'Man', '34', 'time', 'money', 'watch', 'enjoy']",Deliver Us From Eva
601191,A2I1HGEQASZW8D,B00005JLI6,"C. Pompey ""c-nice""","[7, 8]","I never got a chance to go see this movie when it hit the theaters. I rented it not knowing what to expect. After watching it on DVD, I can say that I would not have minded paying the price of the movie ticket to see this movie. It's not all that glamorous, but what it is is a nice feel-good, respectable movie. Gabrielle Union does a nice job playing a rude, obnoxious, man-hating sister by the name of Eva. At times she takes it over the top, but that's acting and that's what she gets paid to do. Eva is bent on taking care of her little sister's who all lean to her for advice instead of their men. The sister's love Eva and listen to her as if her word were the gospel. The men, on the other hand, hate her guts and want nothing more than to see her leave town. She often interferes with her sisters' relationships and makes it a point to drive her sisters' men crazy. So, in order to bring proper order to their respected relationships the men plot to get Eva out of their lives. Thus the need for Ray (LL Cool J). Ray is a smooth-talking playa with serious game. The men talk Ray into dating Eva to get her out of their lives. Ray agrees and thus the story begans with two people falling in love with each other that weren't supposed to fall in love. That's when things get messy for Ray and Eva. Some parts of the movie were a little outrageous and the ending was not the best, but all in all it was still a pretty good movie. I've read some of the reviews on this movie and other movies as well. My thing is that if you want real life situations, go watch a drama or a real life story. This is comedy...comedy's not supposed to be real. It's really an escape from reality. Don't we all need that right about now? Anyway, besides the ending, this movie was well done with the supporting actors doing a great job of playing out their respected roles. Furthermore, the women in this movie are pretty fine. Also, LL did a nice job playing Ray. I have a lot of respect for him as an actor. He didn't over play his part, but he made it believable. All in all, I give this movie a B+.

601194,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00005JLI6,Deborah Earle,"[1, 1]","While I would have to agree with a previous review that denounced the misogynistic response to the title character's domineering behavior, I will note this film's redeeming qualities.A strong charismatic and beautiful Gabrielle Union plays Evangeline (""Eva"") Dandridge, a young woman who had to grow up quickly, beginning work as a health inspector to support her younger sisters after the deaths of their parents in a car accident when she was 18.But now that her sisters, Kareenah( Essence Atkins), Bethany(Robinne Lee),and Jacqui(Megan Good), are financially set as a doctor, beautician, and college student respectively, doing alright for themselves, and are either married or in relationships, the three men, including Kareenah's husband, Tim( Mel Jackson), Jacqui's husband Darrell(Dartanyan Edwards), and Bethany's boyfriend, Mike( Duane Martin), resent Eva's frequent encroachment upon their lives, and the sisters' mindlessly following her lead to the detriment of their relationships with them.We see Eva as a perfectionist in both her job, as a tough and intimidating health inspector, and as the conductor of her church choir.The story reaches a crucial point when a decision is made about the sister's inheritance, that the men dislike.Meeting at a bar, they hire a womanizing player with a history of instability named Ray Adams(L.L. Cool J) to date Eva in order to decrease her influence over  their lives.But as Eva has left many men emotionally damaged in her wake, it will be quite a task.Along for this excursion are Kym Whitley as Ormandy and Royale Watkins as Telly, Bethany's co-workers in the beauty shop that is a ""woman's sanctuary"" into which most males justifyably fear to tread, and during an encounter with Eva's old flame, Lucius Johnson(Dorian Gregory) and his wife, Renee( Kenya Moore), we see how much Eva had to sacrifice when she was young, but the uncomfortable moment is comically redeemed by Ray.Instead of wanting to date Eva for money, Ray actually comes to love Eva, who changes as a result.But once given a professional opportunity for advancement, which could easily result in the men getting what they want, Eva may decide to give that up as well because of Ray. In the meantime, the men's scheme backfires because now, all the sisters do is talk about Ray and Eva, and they are still deprived of more time with their respective wives/sweethearts.A nasty confrontation with Ray after he backs out of the deal leads to the truth of their scheme coming out, and there is the bitterness of betrayal, and separation before all will be resolved.Having known too many African American males who are willing to bring down high achieving and assertive female counterparts who display moral values, I'd say this tale rings true to a degree. But I can feel a little better about a final desire for an honorable relationship in the end.Perhaps even that Bard of Stratford-Upon-Avon would be amused.",4,'The Taming of the Shrew ' for the Hip-Hop Generation,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,2931,"['would', 'have', 'agree', 'previous', 'review', 'denounced', 'misogynistic', 'response', 'title', 'character', 'domineering', 'behavior', 'will', 'note', 'film', 'redeeming', 'qualities.A', 'strong', 'charismatic', 'beautiful', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'Evangeline', 'Eva', 'Dandridge', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'grow', 'up', 'quickly', 'beginning', 'work', 'health', 'inspector', 'support', 'younger', 'sisters', 'deaths', 'parents', 'car', 'accident', 'when', 'was', '18.But', 'now', 'sisters', 'Kareenah', 'Essence', 'Atkins', 'Bethany', 'Robinne', 'Lee', 'Jacqui', 'Megan', 'Good', 'are', 'financially', 'set', 'doctor', 'beautician', 'college', 'student', 'respectively', 'doing', 'alright', 'are', 'married', 'relationships', 'three', 'men', 'including', 'Kareenah', 'husband', 'Tim', 'Mel', 'Jackson', 'Jacqui', 'husband', 'Darrell', 'Dartanyan', 'Edwards', 'Bethany', 'boyfriend', 'Mike', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'resent', 'Eva', 'frequent', 'encroachment', 'lives', 'sisters', 'mindlessly', 'following', 'lead', 'detriment', 'relationships', 'them.We', 'see', 'Eva', 'perfectionist', 'job', 'tough', 'intimidating', 'health', 'inspector', 'conductor', 'church', 'choir.The', 'story', 'crucial', 'point', 'when', 'decision', 'made', 'sister', 'inheritance', 'men', 'dislike.Meeting', 'bar', 'hire', 'womanizing', 'player', 'history', 'instability', 'named', 'Ray', 'Adams', 'L.L', 'Cool', 'J', 'date', 'Eva', 'order', 'decrease', 'influence', 'lives.But', 'Eva', 'left', 'many', 'men', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'wake', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'task.Along', 'excursion', 'are', 'Kym', 'Whitley', 'Ormandy', 'Royale', 'Watkins', 'Telly', 'Bethany', 'co-workers', 'beauty', 'shop', 'woman', 'sanctuary', 'most', 'males', 'justifyably', 'fear', 'tread', 'encounter', 'Eva', 'old', 'flame', 'Lucius', 'Johnson', 'Dorian', 'Gregory', 'wife', 'Renee', 'Kenya', 'Moore', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'Eva', 'had', 'sacrifice', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'uncomfortable', 'moment', 'comically', 'redeemed', 'Ray.Instead', 'wanting', 'date', 'Eva', 'money', 'Ray', 'actually', 'love', 'Eva', 'who', 'result.But', 'once', 'given', 'professional', 'opportunity', 'advancement', 'could', 'easily', 'result', 'men', 'getting', 'what', 'want', 'Eva', 'may', 'decide', 'give', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'Ray', 'meantime', 'men', 'scheme', 'backfires', 'because', 'now', 'sisters', 'do', 'talk', 'Ray', 'Eva', 'are', 'still', 'deprived', 'more', 'time', 'respective', 'wives/sweethearts.A', 'nasty', 'confrontation', 'Ray', 'deal', 'truth', 'scheme', 'coming', 'out', 'bitterness', 'betrayal', 'separation', 'will', 'be', 'resolved.Having', 'known', 'too', 'many', 'African', 'American', 'males', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'bring', 'down', 'high', 'achieving', 'assertive', 'female', 'counterparts', 'who', 'display', 'moral', 'values', ""'d"", 'say', 'tale', 'rings', 'true', 'degree', 'can', 'feel', 'little', 'better', 'final', 'desire', 'honorable', 'relationship', 'end.Perhaps', 'even', 'Bard', 'Stratford-Upon-Avon', 'would', 'be', 'amused']",Deliver Us From Eva

But suprise, LL Cool J (whom I can't really stand as an actor, nor a singer) didn't ruin the film and it turned out to be a success. The success of the film lies in Gabrielle Union (who plays Eva.) Her character plays a head strong liberal female who is a constant pain. She teaches everything she learns to her three sisters, who in turn, use all the advice on their men. After a while the three men finally find a way to get rid of Eva...set her up with a local player, (LL Cool J) Ray -- for the price of $5,000. Ray takes the challenge and soon after him and Eva are getting to know each other a little too well, and the three men can't stand the fact that Eva and Ray fall in love and both are giving her sister's advice, defeating the purpose of Ray and leading to the inevitable showdown. This film was a big suprise, it has both heart and laughter, a DVD that I will surely pick up very soon!

Eva has a sweet face but a steely disposition: a few choice words from her and a once-confident man becomes a virtual basket case. Eva has been in charge of her younger sisters ever since their parents died, many years ago. The mere fact that they're married or engaged hasn't deterred her one bit from continuing to take charge of their lives. But the cost of putting family first has been the deferral of her own dreams--and the assumption of a harder-than-nails personality that no man has been able to crack. Eva's uncanny ability to interfere with her sisters' affairs has not endeared her to their spouses and partners. The men would also like to close out and divide the family trust fund that Eva oversees.

It was recommended to me by the same friend who recommended American History X to me. He wasn't wrong about that movie and he wasnt wrong here. I was skeptical about seeing Gabrielle Union(who is too fine for words) playing a feisty character but the movie was a lot better than the previews led me to believe.Story: 3 brothers who are constantly hen-pecked by their girlfriends' sister Eva hire a player named Raymond(played by LL Cool J) to date her so they can spend more time with their mates. Raymond ends up falling for Eva when he realizes that there is more to her than meets the eye.Gabrielle Union was perfect as the high-strung Eva. I never looked at her the same after this role until I watched the movie recently and saw that her character wasnt that bad. The people that really annoyed me were the black three stooges Mike, Tim and Darrell. I mean, kidnapping Raymond because his relationship was making theirs look bad was in bad taste. I know it's just a movie but that was pretty low what they did. I laughed a lot at Eva when her attitude changed around once she started to date Raymond. The scene where she was in the beauty salon after a night of passion with Raymond had me on the floor rolling. I know women tend to act funny after receiving great sex but man was she goofy. I'll admit that LL Cool J and Gabrielle Union made a great looking couple on screen. There is actually chemistry there and LL lends a certain charm to his character Raymond. I think we need to give LL a little more credit as an actor. When he did his first lead in Out Of Sync I laughed at him but now he's lot better. He was good in Edison Force, S.W.A.T., Deep Blue Sea, Kingdom Come and here in Deliver Us From Eva.Critics are being too hard on this movie. Of course it's predictable but what movie isnt these days? I wasnt checking my watch every minute so that has to be a good sign. It was pretty funny at times and it was sweet. As a retelling of Shakespear's Taming Of The Shrew its pretty good.

I knew even before my boyfriend rented it that this was not going to appeal to me, but I thought just maybe I would be pleasantly surprised...... HOWEVER it was even Worst than I thought. From the first opening scene with the Dancers and singers... what was up with that??? I mean am I watching a Video or a movie is this like the new trend with Urban Movies to have your movies look like a Music Video?I mean who directed this? Gabrielle was OVER THE TOP in her reactions and mannerisms (sp?) I kept rolling my eyes when she would go off (which she did quite a bit)and the way she spoke to everyone. I've seen her do a better job, but every African American actress has to have their own {BAPS} right? LOLLL Cool J still doesn't look comfortable (at least to me) in his acting. I would probably say that LL did better in {Any Given Sunday} the other actors in this movie were also a bit nerve racking, and I sensed a bit of &quot;cooning&quot; on all parts, but that seems to be &quot;okay&quot; in todays Urban Comedies...As I mentioned the storyline/plot is pretty much {Taming of the Shrew} but they throw in some other things into the story that made me wonder why they were even in the movie. This movie was not even THAT funny to me I mean I may have laughed after watching for a 1/2 hour in. Eva has so much control over her sisters that it was not even BELIEVABLE after a point and the men are made to look like they have no Juevos at all.. which I find hard to believe with Brothas it just got to the point where her control wasn't even plausible.

601221,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00005JLI6,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[7, 14]","I wanted to escape Deliver Us From Eva after watching about ten minutes of the movie. This depressing movie loosely based on Shakespeare's The Taming of the shrew grates on the nerves and makes the stomach queasy. I'm going to have to start bringing a barf bag to these black romantic comedies. The abuse that passes as love in black romantic comedies makes me sick to my stomach.The story of Eva revolves around the men who date and are married to the Dandridge sisters, a quartet of girls led by the hostile, man hating, man devouring Matriarchal sister Eva (Gabrielle Union). The men who are dating and married to the other Dandridge sisters can't do anything with their women because the sheep won't do anything without their older sister's approval. In a mean and sinister plan to get control over their households, and the sister's trust fund, the men recruit Ray, a player (LL Cool J) and pay him to date and dump Eva. After several predictable plot twists, Ray falls in love with Eva, and she's forced to choose between him and a big promotion in Chicago. The guys who hired him aren't happy because Eva is supervising the trust fund and the sisters plan on giving it all to her. To get a cut of the money and cut Eva out of their lives, they chain up Ray somewhere and fake his death. Ray busts out of the chains and heads over to the church to reveal the truth to Eva. Eva gets angry and leaves for Chicago. Ray gives up everything he works for and heads to Chicago to convince her to take him back. We get our happy ending and the credits roll. It doesn't matter that Eva or any of the characters haven't grown or changed from their experiences; they all still have the same bad character traits at the end of the movie that they had at the beginning.I wound up sick to my stomach from the mean spirited misogynistic picture presented onscreen as black love. Like The Brothers and The Best Man, Deliver Us From Eva is a shallow movie with cynical message about black romance. Eva presents a even more bitter picture of Black on Black Love than the latter two films, showing it as a war between the sexes where black men and black women don't see each other as human beings deserving love or being capable of it. The dark skinned Eva is shown as evil to the audience because she has an opinion and asserts herself. In this movie Eva's assertion of self is a negative character trait and any black woman who acts in such a fashion is a nasty, hostile person who men can't love. The males in this movie have to humiliate and degrade her before one of them sees her as lovable. But Eva's lighter skinned sisters are as perfect mates. The other three Dandridge Sisters are docile and submissive creatures with no personalities, no opinions of their own and no sense of direction without the guidance of a master. They're never shown as trying to have an opinion of their own or disagreeing with Eva. And the men are never shown as remorseful for their unethical inhuman behavior towards Eva or making an effort to change the way to they treat the black women in their lives. If this is the current state of romance in the black community it's a sad state of affairs. I'd like to think African-Americans could treat each other better.Director Gary Hardwick and his two screenwriters do a poor job putting this film together, wasting time with frames that don't move the story along. The three-minute opening music video sequence where the credits roll is a waste of time that could have been cut. More time needed to been spent developing the characters into real people. Because the three writers barely skim the surface, the film the characters act like stereotypes and we barely get to know anyone. There were so many loose ends that needed tying up on this movie. I wanted to see the other Dandridge sisters develop personalities and opinions instead of being a bunch of zombies. They should have been trying to break away from Eva as much as the men wanted her gone. The men should have learned that the women in their lives were human beings with their own opinions. However, the cinematography on this film was excellent, and the production values top notch.The one-dimensional acting combined with the one-dimensional script makes Eva come off like a made for TV movie instead of a feature film. No one makes the extra effort to needed give their characters the three dimensions needed in a feature film performance. Gabrielle Union takes it way over the top playing Eva. Her facial expressions border on cartoonish. Duane Martin does his frustrated ""All of Us"" character while LL Cool J is his smooth ""Marion Hill"" character from in the House. Essence Atkins is DeeDee from Half and Half. Meegan Goode is flat.Avoid this misogynistic cruel movie posing as a romance. For a real love story, pick up Tyler Perry's Diary of a Mad Black Woman or Darryl Roberts' How U Like me Now. Directors Darren Grant and Darryl Roberts portray black love as something beautiful with balanced healthy pictures of black men and black women.",1,"Mean, misogynistic movie posing as a romance with

The men who are dating these women are up to their ears with her controlling ways, so they call upon the help of Ray (LL Cool J), whom they pay to date and dump Eva so she can stop meddling into their private lives.  I would have been more forgiving if &quot;Deliver Us From Eva&quot; were smooth enough to glide over its flaws, but they stick out like zits on a 14-year-old.  While the film is watchable, the script sometimes tries too hard to get its point across, has clumsy dialogue and predictable one-liners, and is mostly surprise-free to the average moviegoer.  Plus, I often found it hard to believe that these grown women are so empty-headed that they'll uncritically follow whatever instructions their sister gives them.  I mean, what's so great about Eva? How did she get on such a high pedestal and what makes her so incredibly superior to the other ladies?  The movie doesn't give a convincing answer and falters as a result.  But it's still worth a look solely for Union, who lights up the screen in a role that's simultaneously irritating yet hilarious.  Leaving no room for ambiguity, Eva makes it clear to everyone (even her local minister) that her way is the right way.  LL Cool J (credited as James Todd Smith in this movie) continues to show promise as an actor, but if his performance indicates anything, it's that he still needs to learn how to completely relax in front of a camera.  Still, Smith possesses a warmth in &quot;Eva&quot; we haven't witnessed in his prior films such as &quot;Any Given Sunday.&quot;  To be honest, &quot;Deliver Us From Eva&quot; is really a 2-star movie, but I'm feeling generous today, so I'll give it an extra star solely because of Gabrielle Union.  Even as the movie threatens to collapse, she holds herself together, which is no mean feat considering the second-rate material she had to work with here.",3,Deliver Us From Predictability.,1060300800,"08 8, 2003",2003,2486,"['behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'featured', 'quot', 'Deliver', 'Us', 'From', 'Eva', 'quot', 'DVD', 'star', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'quot', 'are', 'lot', 'firsts', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'ever.', 'quot', 'Well', 'having', 'watched', 'film', 'can', 'attest', 'comment', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'true', 'quot', 'Deliver', 'Us', 'From', 'Eva', 'quot', 'actually', 'charted', 'territory', 'script', 'really', 'urbanized', 'retelling', 'quot', 'Taming', 'Shrew.', 'quot', 'Union', 'ball', 'Eva', 'no-nonsense', 'take-the-bull-by-the-horns', 'woman', 'who', 'lives', 'three', 'sisters', 'relationships', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'dating', 'women', 'are', 'up', 'ears', 'controlling', 'ways', 'call', 'help', 'Ray', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'whom', 'pay', 'date', 'dump', 'Eva', 'can', 'stop', 'meddling', 'private', 'lives', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'forgiving', 'quot', 'Deliver', 'Us', 'From', 'Eva', 'quot', 'were', 'smooth', 'enough', 'glide', 'flaws', 'stick', 'out', 'zits', '14-year-old', 'film', 'watchable', 'script', 'sometimes', 'too', 'hard', 'get', 'point', 'across', 'clumsy', 'dialogue', 'predictable', 'one-liners', 'mostly', 'surprise-free', 'average', 'moviegoer', 'often', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'grown', 'women', 'are', 'so', 'empty-headed', ""'ll"", 'uncritically', 'follow', 'instructions', 'sister', 'mean', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'Eva', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'high', 'pedestal', 'what', 'so', 'incredibly', 'superior', 'other', 'ladies', 'movie', ""n't"", 'give', 'convincing', 'answer', 'falters', 'result', 'still', 'worth', 'look', 'solely', 'Union', 'who', 'up', 'screen', 'role', 'simultaneously', 'irritating', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'Leaving', 'room', 'ambiguity', 'Eva', 'clear', 'everyone', 'even', 'local', 'minister', 'way', 'right', 'way', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'credited', 'James', 'Todd', 'Smith', 'movie', 'show', 'promise', 'actor', 'performance', 'anything', 'still', 'learn', 'how', 'completely', 'relax', 'front', 'camera', 'Still', 'Smith', 'warmth', 'quot', 'Eva', 'quot', 'have', ""n't"", 'witnessed', 'prior', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday.', 'quot', 'be', 'honest', 'quot', 'Deliver', 'Us', 'From', 'Eva', 'quot', 'really', '2-star', 'movie', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'generous', 'today', 'so', ""'ll"", 'give', 'extra', 'star', 'solely', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'Even', 'movie', 'collapse', 'together', 'mean', 'feat', 'considering', 'second-rate', 'material', 'had', 'work', 'here']",Deliver Us From Eva

601230,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JLI6,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","Two good leads James Todd Smith aka LL Cool J (so the credit goes) and gifted Gabrielle Union raise this romatic comedy film's quality one notch higher.  The film suffers from its predictable story and some awfully stereotyped characters, but certainly there is chemistry between Ms. Union and Mr. Smith which sprinkles considerable charms on the screen.Yet another modernized variation of Shakespearean love theme, 'Deliver Us From Eva' features Eva (Union), uptight woman who could mercilessly beat the men with her fast-spitting rapid-fire words.  Today, she organizes a book-reading meeting with three sisters of hers, and the book happens to be Toni Morrison's 'Beloved,' accompanied with the video starring Oprah.  Three guys who live with the sisters (not Eve), claims that they want to see a football game on TV, but as you see, their slightest hope is crushed by Eve before they knew it.So, the three unhappy men talk suave lady's man Raymond (Smith) into asking man-hater Eve for date, in order to get rid of Eva' influence to other sisters, and their life.  Cool Raymond, who in turn asks for reward $ 5,000, finally agrees, and he approaches to her.  The results?  Now you know it.It's not the thin characters that hold the center of the film, and definitely not the familiar story -- what is really wonderful is the acting of the two leading players, LL Cool J and Gabrielle Union.  LL Cool J is always a reliable actor in actions, but in this comedy he shows more tender, likable side.  But more impressive is Ms. Union, whose character Eve is not always an amiable person, who often looks like a caricature of bossy woman with an icy heart.  Actually she is not, as it turns out, but without her skilled acting Eve would have been more mean-spirited, nasty creation who makes every viewer think 'Deliver us from her.'The film is produced by FOCUS film (which gave us gritty '21 grams'), and that is a bit surprising, but more surprising thing is that the film, unlike that Sean Penn film, lacks the bite this company could have added.  Not that I complain; but 'Deliver Us From Eva' though it is cozy and warm, could be different, different in a better, more unpredictable  way.",3,"Decent, Ordinary Romantic Comedy Upgraded by Two Good Leads",1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,2193,"['Two', 'good', 'leads', 'James', 'Todd', 'Smith', 'aka', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'credit', 'gifted', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'raise', 'romatic', 'comedy', 'film', 'quality', 'one', 'notch', 'higher', 'film', 'suffers', 'predictable', 'story', 'awfully', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'certainly', 'chemistry', 'Ms.', 'Union', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'considerable', 'charms', 'screen.Yet', 'modernized', 'variation', 'Shakespearean', 'love', 'theme', 'Us', 'From', 'Eva', 'features', 'Eva', 'Union', 'uptight', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'mercilessly', 'beat', 'men', 'fast-spitting', 'rapid-fire', 'words', 'Today', 'book-reading', 'meeting', 'three', 'sisters', 'hers', 'book', 'be', 'Toni', 'Morrison', ""'Beloved"", 'accompanied', 'video', 'starring', 'Oprah', 'Three', 'guys', 'who', 'live', 'sisters', 'not', 'Eve', 'want', 'see', 'football', 'game', 'TV', 'see', 'slightest', 'hope', 'crushed', 'Eve', 'knew', 'it.So', 'three', 'unhappy', 'men', 'talk', 'suave', 'lady', 'man', 'Raymond', 'Smith', 'asking', 'man-hater', 'Eve', 'date', 'order', 'get', 'rid', 'Eva', 'influence', 'other', 'sisters', 'life', 'Cool', 'Raymond', 'who', 'turn', 'asks', 'reward', '5,000', 'finally', 'results', 'Now', 'know', 'it.It', 'not', 'thin', 'characters', 'hold', 'center', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'familiar', 'story', 'what', 'really', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'two', 'leading', 'players', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'always', 'reliable', 'actor', 'actions', 'comedy', 'more', 'tender', 'likable', 'side', 'more', 'impressive', 'Ms.', 'Union', 'character', 'Eve', 'not', 'always', 'amiable', 'person', 'who', 'often', 'caricature', 'bossy', 'woman', 'icy', 'heart', 'Actually', 'not', 'out', 'skilled', 'acting', 'Eve', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'mean-spirited', 'nasty', 'creation', 'who', 'viewer', 'think', ""'The"", 'film', 'produced', 'FOCUS', 'film', 'gave', 'gritty', 'grams', 'bit', 'surprising', 'more', 'surprising', 'thing', 'film', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'film', 'bite', 'company', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'Not', 'complain', ""'Deliver"", 'Eva', 'cozy', 'warm', 'could', 'be', 'different', 'different', 'better', 'more', 'unpredictable', 'way']",Deliver Us From Eva
