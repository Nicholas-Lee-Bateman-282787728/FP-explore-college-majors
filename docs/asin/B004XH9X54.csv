The contestants are a mix of lazy short order cooks (Lacey), braggarts (Seth), and those who operate in an manner with the utmost integrity (Paula) . .Perhaps I love this show because many of those who pass through the doors are a reflection and mirror image of a workforce that many supervisors & managers (myself included) encounter each and every day; only the location and environment is different.  Not for the faint of heart if your ears are sensitive, but this is one show that seems to get better each and every year.",5,If you love to watch train wrecks before they actually happen . .,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,855,"['Many', 'people', 'probably', 'think', 'Ramsay', 'total', '%', '^', '^', 'see', 'stuff', 'supposed', 'chefs', 'try', 'pull', 'times', 'wonder', 'out', '.and', 'great', 'part', 'DVD', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'totally', 'uncensored', 'even', 'more', 'realistic', 'view', 'going', 'contestants', 'are', 'mix', 'lazy', 'short', 'order', 'cooks', 'Lacey', 'braggarts', 'Seth', 'who', 'operate', 'manner', 'utmost', 'integrity', 'Paula', 'love', 'show', 'many', 'who', 'pass', 'doors', 'are', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'image', 'workforce', 'many', 'supervisors', 'managers', 'included', 'encounter', 'day', 'only', 'location', 'environment', 'different', 'Not', 'faint', 'heart', 'ears', 'are', 'sensitive', 'one', 'show', 'get', 'better', 'year']",N/A

This season, teamwork spirit is strong, friendships and respect appear everywhere. The challenges are great, Ramsay delivers some of his more memorable lines (Episode 10). And everything else is amazing.That sums it up right there, this is season 4 on a much better scale.But like with season 4 it has two weaknesess.1)""Idiots"" who can't function on the show stay on the show for a while.2)I spotted the correct final two a mile away, it wasn't hard once the black jackets came.Easily one of the best seasons of the show, if not the best.
