753067,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00009AOBM,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 2]","In Heathers Christian Slater was really funny. He was channeling Jack Nicholson, I'll give you that, but his brand of dry humor really made Heathers a cult comedy classic. In Kuffs, he continues with the same shtick, but it really gets old because the movie is not very good, and though I like Christian Slater's Nicholson impression even better than Nicholson's own brand of self parody, it needs something to play against. It needs, at bare minimum, a good movie to surround Slater's Nicholson impression. Kuffs was not that movie.Anytime a movie has to start out with an expository scene explaining an implausible situation in the vain hope that you will suspend disbelief you know you're doomed. Kuffs explains that George Kuffs' brother runs a business in San Francisco called a special patrol, where the citizens and business owners of a neighborhood hire their own private police force to protect them. When his brother is killed by a brazen hit man Kuffs inherits the business. It is a very stupid idea, and the movie continues in that stupid vein, getting stupider and stupider.Another sign of Danger, Danger, Will Robinson, is the next scene, the first time we see our ostensible hero George Kuffs, he and his girlfriend Maya Carlton (Milla Jovovich) are dancing, and his shirt comes off. Right from the first he just seems like a narcissistic jerk. Aren't I cute? Look at me! His shirt comes off a lot, but every time it does it is totally gratuitous. I'll grant you that he does take Maya's outer garments off, too, but that is integral to the 'plot.'And he talks to the camera. I like that technique sometimes, where they tear down the fourth wall, like in (500) Days of Summer or High Fidelity, but, again, unless you have a good movie to back it up that kind of stuff just comes off like self indulgence.Bottom line is that Kuffs is a bad film, and unless you are a big fan of Christian Slater--or you are his mother--and don't care how bad the movie is, as long as he's in it; or if you hate Slater and want to laugh at him, not with him, and would get off with some kind of perverse schadenfreude at Slater's self-immolation, kindly step away from Kuffs.

In that respect, KUFFS will be a majordisappointment for those expecting Judd to be at thecenter stage.In reality, the protagonist is the Jack Nicholson wannabeor hopeful of the time, Christian Slater as well as thecity of San Francisco. Much like the other movie, also inSan Francisco, (TWISTED with Ashley Judd), that city isprominently shown in various aspects, namely the worldreknowned bridge, and some surroundings of the area,parks, hills, etc.The story is not entirely serious, which is a benefit,considering most people going to the movies want to relax,so in this sense, the picture is successful, if not forthe not tasteless but redundant nudity involving Slaterand the lovely and young Milla Jovovich, playing his girlfriend.The movie, from a visual point of view, works extremelywell, with many varied, sharp,colored and interestingstreets, buildings and filming locations chosen. Anyonenot having done tourism in that city or area will benefit,much like that which is the case in another movie, showingRaleigh, NC, ""Kiss the Girls"" with Morgan Freeman, for example.There is a focus on the clothes people wear, obviously, asthe characters seem to only wear pastel-colored items that manyfor some were trendy at the time, as made clear from othermovies, such as Miami Vice, also from the 80's, for example.Ironically, in the opening sequence, the bad guy has his mugshot stenciled onto his pastel T-Shirt, yet is covering hisface with a scarf, to avoid being later recognized. Howhis victims would fail to remember to police the image seen on hisT-Shirt, to track him down, is less understood.The weak spot, clearly, is the music, as it is had considerablyaged and seems considerably unsophisticated. In reality, the music mayor may not be a liability, considering often there's adiscrepancy in tastes and musical experience among theaudience, regardless of age, who themselves are very differnetfrom one another.A a recurring jingle is obviously inspired from the one heardon Beverly Hills Cop, a big commercial success at about thesame year KUFFS was released.Overall, KUFFS completely wasted Judd's acting talents, asonly 90 seconds were shown.
