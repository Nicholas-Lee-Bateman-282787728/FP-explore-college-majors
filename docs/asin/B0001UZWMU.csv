If you think that courage is a great Christian virtue, then this is a movie that you will treasure.  An absolutely magnificent supporting cast powerfully backs up Ingrid Bergman in her finest role.  How that one woman overshadows such a powerful cast is a study in acting all by itself.Ths story is ageless.  An illiterate peasant girl from nowhere in France responds to a godly call and literally changes the world.  Saint Joan reversed the course of the Hundred Years War, forever ended English ambitions on the Continent, and invented the concept of nationalism.

Although the earlier movie focused only on her trial and execution, this update covers more of her life, but with much less verve and fervency.Bergman is the maid of Lorraine who convinces the Dauphin (Charles VII) that divine voices have commanded her to lead the French army against the English. Bergman has a bewildered look about her that is always on the verge of becoming hand-wrenching: there is little strength of character behind her (one assumes she would need plenty), except for maybe in the one battle scene. In fact, that scene is just about the only rousing thing in the whole picture.The burning at the stake climax, where passion is absolutely required (and where Falconetti achieved screen immortality) is reduced by Bergman to tears and talk. At least they restored the thing to its rightful 145 minutes; the cut version (which is what the VHS copies are, usually), which was 45 minutes shorter, was a travesty (the cuts were done so crudely you could actually see where they were made).

813408,A2RD0B8LLOSMCQ,B0001UZWMU,"Christian Lehrer ""Christian Lehrer""","[34, 36]","For my birthday I received the new DVD of Victor Fleming's 1948 Technicolor production of ""Joan of Arc"" starring the ever radiant Ingrid Bergman.  Image produced the DVD and the UCLA film archive spent years restoring the film and putting in all the footage trimmed from its original 146 minute release.  Many of us saw a shortened and doctored print of this film on television growing up.  I did not know than that the film had not only been cut down, but additional footage, including the maps showing Joan's journey had actually been added along the way.  This edited version was released on VHS by Sterling Video and on Laserdisc by VidAmerica.  Both editions have been unavailable for some time.  I managed to rent the Laserdisc after reading another review that said it featured the ""shorter version"".  It corresponded to what I remembered watching on TV so it dawned on me that I had never seen the entire film.  I assumed the rest was probably lost and I never would, but thanks to the painstaking efforts of the UCLA film archive with help from the Motion Picture Academy, private collecters and even (according to the insert) a film museum in the Netherlands, we have the complete film magnificently restored.  Ingrid Bergman turns in a wonderful perfomance along with Jose Ferrer, Cecil Kellaway and host of other well known faces from that time.  George Zucco even has a small part as captain of a border guard and for once does not play a heavy.  Ingrid Bergman caught some flak at the time for playing against type herself as her own personal life came under scrutiny.  Despite this she was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award.  The film won three Oscars including a special award to producer Walter Wanger, Cinematography and Costume Design.  It was also nominated for Supporting Actor-Jose Ferrer, Art Direction, Film Editing and Score.  Thanks to Image entertainment for bringing yet another classic gem to DVD!

Ingrid Bergman played Joan of Arc with as much reverence and solemnity as she did in the Bells of St. Mary's. She wore a very short hair, not unlike her look in ""For whom the bell tolls"". She looked convincingly young, brave and strong to shoulder such a daunting task of fighting against the Burgundians and English. The major battle scene, though not shot at actual site, was engaging nonetheless.Joan of Arc's convictions and determination led her people to victory. But what was true then is still true now. Leaders have the final say. Coronation of a short-sighted and corrupted king underlied the tragic end of Joan of Arc. And Ingrid Bergman had the depth and sophistication to handle the agony, frustration and disappointment when she was later betrayed by her own king, then captured by the enemies and in the end faced the grand trial. She revealed her struggles - at one time she submitted when she could hold out no longer; and came to peace only when she accepted her destiny.

I give it a one-star rating, though, to me, it doesn't even deserve that. But, I give it one star because it's better than nothing at all. I did not receive the DVD version that was issued with the cover as shown on this Review above. I have seen that version from renting it from my local Public Library. That version is very good and it was the kind of version and quality I was expecting to get. It was a cleaned-up version and the cinematography was clear and colourful and everything. But, for this DVD/Film which amazon.com advertised, for a common DVD price of around $15. (give or take), it is a Korean-marketed version. The cover has mostly Korean on it.  Now, I really don't mind that so much, as long as the DVD or Film itself is good. But, it isn't. The good things about the Korean-version is the quality of the plastic case and the cover design is okay. but, beyond that, as far as the meat and potatoes of the Film/DVD, the visuals are ""fuzzy"" and the colouring is horrific. You can hardly make out the images. I mean, you CAN, but, not as readily. The colours bleed into each other like a bad watercolour. I was so initially disappointed that I wanted to just throw it away and count my money as a loss, and another ""lesson learned"". But, I kept it only because I love the Film a lot and I can't, at this point, find a good version of it anywhere else to purchase for my own, that is without paying an exorbitant amount. I am not paying $80. for this DVD when it ought to cost no more than any other common DVD. I would not recommend this version I received to anyone. Sorry on this one, amazon. Usually amazon sells good quality products, or has good quality ones sold through them. But, this one is an absolute bomb, to me. Like I said, I am keeping it. But, once I find a better quality version at a decent DVD price, I'll plan to purchase that and I will get rid of the one that I just bought.

Holly ""piper909""","[28, 31]","This DVD hasn't been released yet, but from the details that are supplied it looks to be the complete  theatrical roadshow version that has been unavailable in the US, at least, for  35 years or longer (I have faint memories of seeing this on TV, in two parts, in the Sixties).  Finally!  I understand that this has involved a major film restoration project and will hope that the technical results have been worth it, since this is the best English-language Joan of Arc film to have been made, still.  (More recent films have been marred by slipshod performances, weak scripts, and dubious historical accuracy at best.)  This movie has been previously released on home video in a criminally butchered 100-minute version and even that is long out of print.This important movie belongs in the collection of anyone with a serious interest in learning something about the life and career of Jeanne d'Arc.Update, May 21, 2004:  The DVD is available now; I have viewed about half of this so far and can report that it is a spectacular job of film restoration.  The colors are vivid and distinct, the image sharp, and the soundtrack clear and distinct even in its monophonic mix.  This 56-year old Technicolor movie looks like it was released last week.  All the fantastic detail work in the backgrounds, costumes, and matte paintings is clearly visible and Ingrid glows more beatifically than ever before.

The story follows the well-known outlines of the short life of the 15th century French saint, Joan of Arc...Guided by divine Voices, the visionary daughter of a plowman, Joan (Ingrid Bergman), wearing men's clothes, leaves Domremy her village town in Lorraine and takes her long journey to Chinon to meet the Dauphin Charles VII (Jose Ferrer).Inspired by God to free France from the ravages of the invading English, the peasant girl persuades the indecisive Dauphin to recruit an army and run out the ruthless invaders clearing the way for him to be crown King of France...Joan leads the French Army to victory over the English forces at Orleans and stands proudly besides her king - as she promised - at his coronation in Rheims' Cathedral...The Maid's followers believed that she came from God and the Burgundians and English were stricken with fear at her success... But Charles was tricky, ambition and deceitful in his goals... A counterplot was at work as a mean truce is suddenly signed with England, frustrating Joan's zeal to rid France of the enemy...In an ironic twist of fate, the Maid of Lorraine becomes a political prisoner... She is closely guarded and kept in irons, and is tried as a witch by an English-dominated church court...With no council to aid her, except her Voices, we see the intrigued illiterate girl, pitted against Bishop Pierre Cauchon (Francis L. Sullivan) trained in all the complexities of legal exhausting questioning...We may ask ourselves how so many ideas and intuitions are to be found in a person so simple as she was saintly... Joan is, above all things else, the wisdom of a good people... She is the people of France, the plain people of the countryside of Lorraine which is sweet and clean through the courage and faith of the people as much as through the smell of woods and orchards...Ingrid Bergman portrays with deep conviction her role as the delicate innocent virgin who raised the spirit of the French to hope for better times... She curbed savage England and stopped the spoiling and burning of France... Bergman's smiling face invoked spiritual revelation, the required light of a charismatic true heroine...",4,The Maid who was sent from Heaven to support her failing France...,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,2243,"['are', '1429', 'period', 'Hundred', 'Years', 'War', 'France', 'England', 'story', 'well-known', 'outlines', 'short', 'life', '15th', 'century', 'French', 'saint', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'Guided', 'divine', 'Voices', 'visionary', 'daughter', 'plowman', 'Joan', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'wearing', 'men', 'clothes', 'Domremy', 'village', 'town', 'Lorraine', 'long', 'journey', 'Chinon', 'meet', 'Dauphin', 'Charles', 'VII', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', '.Inspired', 'God', 'free', 'France', 'ravages', 'invading', 'English', 'peasant', 'girl', 'indecisive', 'Dauphin', 'recruit', 'army', 'run', 'out', 'ruthless', 'invaders', 'clearing', 'way', 'be', 'crown', 'King', 'France', 'Joan', 'French', 'Army', 'victory', 'English', 'forces', 'Orleans', 'proudly', 'king', 'promised', 'coronation', 'Rheims', 'Cathedral', 'Maid', 'followers', 'believed', 'came', 'God', 'Burgundians', 'English', 'were', 'stricken', 'fear', 'success', 'Charles', 'was', 'tricky', 'ambition', 'deceitful', 'goals', 'counterplot', 'was', 'work', 'mean', 'truce', 'suddenly', 'signed', 'England', 'frustrating', 'Joan', 'zeal', 'rid', 'France', 'enemy', 'ironic', 'twist', 'fate', 'Maid', 'Lorraine', 'political', 'prisoner', 'closely', 'guarded', 'kept', 'irons', 'tried', 'witch', 'English-dominated', 'church', 'court', 'council', 'aid', 'Voices', 'see', 'intrigued', 'illiterate', 'girl', 'pitted', 'Bishop', 'Pierre', 'Cauchon', 'Francis', 'L.', 'Sullivan', 'trained', 'complexities', 'legal', 'exhausting', 'questioning', 'may', 'ask', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'ideas', 'intuitions', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'person', 'so', 'simple', 'was', 'saintly', 'Joan', 'things', 'else', 'wisdom', 'good', 'people', 'people', 'France', 'plain', 'people', 'countryside', 'Lorraine', 'sweet', 'clean', 'courage', 'faith', 'people', 'as', 'much', 'smell', 'woods', 'orchards', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'deep', 'conviction', 'role', 'delicate', 'innocent', 'virgin', 'who', 'raised', 'spirit', 'French', 'hope', 'better', 'times', 'curbed', 'savage', 'England', 'stopped', 'spoiling', 'burning', 'France', 'Bergman', 'smiling', 'face', 'invoked', 'spiritual', 'revelation', 'required', 'light', 'charismatic', 'true', 'heroine']",Joan of Arc

Many versions of this extraordinary girl's life have been put onto film stretching right back to the silent era but as so little is really known of her character and what she actually looked like; each of these screen interpretations is at best a partial recreation of this incredible young girl. The Victor Fleming 1948 version for RKO starring Ingrid Bergman in one of her most famous roles is still one of the best known versions and it certainly has gathered both its admirers and critics over the years since its initial release. The chief criticism of ""Joan of Arc"", centred around its sound stage bound appearance and the fact that Ingrid Bergman was 33 years of age when she portrayed the teenage peasant girl who led the French armies to victory. Despite these obvious failings I feel the film still has much to offer and Ingrid Bergman in a role she had already played on stage gives a wonderfully sincere and restrained performance as the young maid who saved France from England's occupying forces only to be later burnt as a witch.",4,"Ingrid Bergman In One Of Her Best Remembered Roles As ""The Maid of Orleans"".",1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,1256,"['Joan', 'Arc', 'Patron', 'Saint', 'France', 'young', 'girl', 'long', 'revered', 'French', 'saviour', 'country', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'certainly', 'lofty', 'character', 'actress', 'try', 'portray', 'screen', 'Many', 'versions', 'extraordinary', 'girl', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'film', 'stretching', 'right', 'back', 'silent', 'era', 'so', 'little', 'really', 'known', 'character', 'what', 'actually', 'looked', 'screen', 'interpretations', 'best', 'partial', 'recreation', 'incredible', 'young', 'girl', 'Victor', 'Fleming', '1948', 'version', 'RKO', 'starring', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'roles', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'known', 'versions', 'certainly', 'gathered', 'admirers', 'critics', 'years', 'initial', 'release', 'chief', 'criticism', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'centred', 'sound', 'stage', 'bound', 'appearance', 'fact', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'was', '33', 'years', 'age', 'when', 'portrayed', 'teenage', 'peasant', 'girl', 'who', 'led', 'French', 'armies', 'victory', 'obvious', 'failings', 'feel', 'film', 'still', 'much', 'offer', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'role', 'had', 'already', 'played', 'stage', 'wonderfully', 'sincere', 'restrained', 'performance', 'young', 'maid', 'who', 'saved', 'France', 'England', 'occupying', 'forces', 'only', 'be', 'later', 'burnt', 'witch']",Joan of Arc

Maxwell Anderson's play was creaking at the timbers even in 1948, and the screenplay remains resolutely theatrical despite one good battle scene. Ingrid Bergman is okay in her quiet moments, but handles her big declamatory scenes with extreme clumsiness - it's one of those performances where you can all too easily spot where she's marked her script, and too often it's more about hitting artificial cues than giving a fluid or convincing reading. If anything, you find yourself wondering why her nose looks so big all the time and marvel at how the more inspired Joan is, the more Swedish she sounds. Instead, the film belongs to Jose Ferrer, making a remarkable debut as the weak and feminine Dauphin. It's watchable enough, but there's a cosy feeling about the film: even the burning at the stake seems more photogenic than horrendous.
