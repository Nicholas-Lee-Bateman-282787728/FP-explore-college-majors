I was thinking with the animation and somewhat recognizable voices, it would be an easy and enjoyable watch.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.  We did not make it halfway through the movie before we decided to turn it off.  Yes we are &#34;believers&#34; but this movie was not the right fit for my kids (12, 15) and I was just simply fooled into thinking since it was animated they would enjoy it like the other ones.Solid message they are sharing, just at a very basic (maybe under 8 yrs old?) age group.",2,"For the very, very young.",1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,583,"['was', 'so', 'bummed', 'when', 'threw', '3D', 'player', 'Easter', 'watch', 'was', 'thinking', 'animation', 'somewhat', 'recognizable', 'voices', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'halfway', 'movie', 'decided', 'turn', 'off', 'are', '34', 'believers', '34', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'fit', 'kids', '12', '15', 'was', 'just', 'simply', 'fooled', 'thinking', 'was', 'animated', 'would', 'enjoy', 'other', 'ones.Solid', 'message', 'are', 'sharing', 'just', 'very', 'basic', 'maybe', '8', 'yrs', 'old', 'age', 'group']",The Lion of Judah

Back-up music sounded a little too Black gospel rock for the on-screen visuals until I realized it was a South African production in which case it was perfect! Story has some ah-ha moments and is tied into the final days of Jesus. It basically focuses on the last lamb to be sacrificed in the Temple while the Lamb of God is being sacrificed on the cross. His side-kick, among others, is the rooster that somehow gets lost and befuddled in an agitated Jerusalem and crows three times. In the end all the animals are saved and set free--as we all were/are--through the mission of Jesus.",3,Story of Jesus' sacrifice and mission as told by participating farm animals,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,642,"['Animation', 'quite', 'good', 'stylistic', 'sort', 'non-USA', 'way', 'Back-up', 'music', 'sounded', 'little', 'too', 'Black', 'gospel', 'rock', 'on-screen', 'visuals', 'realized', 'was', 'South', 'African', 'production', 'case', 'was', 'perfect', 'Story', 'ah-ha', 'moments', 'tied', 'final', 'days', 'Jesus', 'basically', 'last', 'lamb', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'Temple', 'Lamb', 'God', 'being', 'sacrificed', 'cross', 'side-kick', 'others', 'rooster', 'somehow', 'lost', 'befuddled', 'agitated', 'Jerusalem', 'three', 'times', 'end', 'animals', 'are', 'saved', 'set', 'free', 'were/are', 'mission', 'Jesus']",The Lion of Judah

I confess that I was worried the kids wouldn't like it.  But by the end of the movie and the animals realized why Jesus died on the cross, even the teenagers were saying it was very good.
