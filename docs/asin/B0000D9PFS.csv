The first song called, ""Bow Wow, Wow, Wow"" that's very cute, because it talks about any dog, including Wags and his puppies, (The Wagattes), to get a bone from his owner.  There's something else that was pretty funny, too.Captain Feathersword surprised Greg by pretending to be a flower and called himself, Captain Flowersword.  That's the most wonderful part of all in Top of the Tots DVD.",5,It's Quite A Blast On Stage!,1074384000,"01 18, 2004",2004,474,"['already', 'watched', 'Wiggles', 'Top', 'Tots', 'DVD', 'once', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'first', 'song', 'called', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'Wow', 'Wow', 'very', 'cute', 'dog', 'including', 'Wags', 'puppies', 'Wagattes', 'get', 'bone', 'owner', 'something', 'else', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'too.Captain', 'Feathersword', 'surprised', 'Greg', 'pretending', 'be', 'flower', 'called', 'Captain', 'Flowersword', 'most', 'wonderful', 'part', 'Top', 'Tots', 'DVD']",N/A

It's neat to see them at the Great Wall of China, New York City, etc., to introduce children to various occupations and how they help us.  You don't usually hear words like ""botanist"" and ""horticulturalist"" in children's songs, but you'll hear it in this video!  I just love the educational value of these videos and all the positive reinforcement they provide.  It's just refreshing to see something positive for a change.  My child loves this video and really enjoyed the ""Feeling Chirpy"" song.  Pretty funny stuff there!  That song alone is worth the price of the DVD.  Try keeping that one out of your head!  Going through many occupations in this video, the Wiggles do a great job explaining what each person does and how they help us.  It also is a great idea that they included going to the doctor and the dentist on it - this is a great way to get rid of any hesitations that your child may have.  My little one just loves this DVD.  I like hearing him singing along to ""Bow Wow Wow Wow.""  No, the Wiggles are not dancing as much in this one but oh well.  It's a great video.  The only part I didn't like was the swimming section.  It's a little dry and could have used some spicing up a bit.  You HAVE to get the DVD to see the interview that Murray is doing with Shamus (one of the children in the video).  Murray starts off asking Shamus about baking bread, but he winds up telling Murray this great fishing story!  It's pretty hysterical!  Plus the out-takes of the making of the ""Cold Spaghetti"" western are great fun!  That pirate is something else once again.  He should get awards for what he does.

777125,AGFW667QNHDOY,B0000D9PFS,S. Lipson,"[11, 11]","I think this Wiggles video is good because it offers a nice selection of teaching with the usual Wiggles song and dance format. I like the character career profiles and their simplistic job descriptions. I'm not particularly put off about the predominence of ""professional dancers"" over the original Wiggles. I think this format is a refreshing change, but retains enough of the familiarity of the more traditional Wiggles releases. The DVD offers an extensive (about 20 minutes) ""making of"" preview of a yet to be released Cold Spaghetti Western. There is a significant amount of behind the scenes footage as well as outtakes and documentary interview-type profiles of actors and characters. The DVD has a Jukebox song selection where you may chose to watch//listen to individual songs. There is also a photo gallery which I believe is not narrated. The songs are new and refreshing- not dull and drippy like I thought they were in Wiggle Bay. At least one of the songs I have previously seen on the TV series (i.e. Central Park New York). I think this DVD is worth buying, especially for any Wiggles fan (we have at least 10). If you are new to the Wiggles, this would make a fine start. You might be interested in knowing however, that earlier releases (before their rocket to fame) generally are much simpler, less flashy productions, and focused more on just upbeat singing and dancing of the Wiggles themselves and little kids.",4,A very good Wiggles choice.,1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,1433,"['think', 'Wiggles', 'video', 'good', 'nice', 'selection', 'teaching', 'usual', 'Wiggles', 'song', 'dance', 'format', 'character', 'career', 'profiles', 'simplistic', 'job', 'descriptions', ""'m"", 'not', 'particularly', 'put', 'off', 'predominence', 'professional', 'dancers', 'original', 'Wiggles', 'think', 'format', 'refreshing', 'change', 'enough', 'familiarity', 'more', 'traditional', 'Wiggles', 'releases', 'DVD', 'extensive', '20', 'minutes', 'making', 'preview', 'yet', 'be', 'released', 'Cold', 'Spaghetti', 'Western', 'significant', 'amount', 'scenes', 'footage', 'as', 'well', 'outtakes', 'documentary', 'interview-type', 'profiles', 'actors', 'characters', 'DVD', 'Jukebox', 'song', 'selection', 'where', 'may', 'chose', 'watch//listen', 'individual', 'songs', 'also', 'photo', 'gallery', 'believe', 'not', 'narrated', 'songs', 'are', 'new', 'refreshing-', 'not', 'dull', 'drippy', 'thought', 'were', 'Wiggle', 'Bay', 'least', 'one', 'songs', 'have', 'previously', 'seen', 'TV', 'series', 'i.e', 'Central', 'Park', 'New', 'York', 'think', 'DVD', 'worth', 'buying', 'especially', 'Wiggles', 'fan', 'have', 'least', '10', 'are', 'new', 'Wiggles', 'would', 'make', 'fine', 'start', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'knowing', 'however', 'earlier', 'releases', 'rocket', 'fame', 'generally', 'are', 'much', 'simpler', 'less', 'flashy', 'productions', 'focused', 'more', 'just', 'upbeat', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Wiggles', 'little', 'kids']",N/A
