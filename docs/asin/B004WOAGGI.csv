1430863,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B004WOAGGI,Amanda Richards,"[2, 7]","Short attention span summary:1. `80s cupcake Lea Thompson makes tiny cupcakes in a small town2. `80s rebel Judd Nelson plays her police officer husband.3. Conned into entering the mayoral race, the cookie crumbles when the incumbent mayor bites off more than he can chew.4. It doesn't take a college degree to see that there's something rotten in the state of the town.5.  Predictable movie follows.Sure, it's sweet and all, but the bad guys are clich&eacute;d, and unfortunately so is much of the storyline. Those old enough to have seen The Breakfast Club will get a chuckle out of Judd Nelson jamming to a familiar tune, but other than memorable music and a few cameos, there isn't much more here.Recommended rental for purposes of nostalgia.Amanda Richards, July 27, 2011",3,Regular cupcake,1311724800,"07 27, 2011",2011,775,"['Short', 'attention', 'span', 'summary:1', '80s', 'cupcake', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'tiny', 'cupcakes', 'small', 'town2', '80s', 'rebel', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'police', 'officer', 'husband.3', 'Conned', 'entering', 'mayoral', 'race', 'cookie', 'crumbles', 'when', 'incumbent', 'mayor', 'more', 'can', 'chew.4', ""n't"", 'take', 'college', 'degree', 'see', 'something', 'rotten', 'state', 'town.5', 'Predictable', 'movie', 'follows.Sure', 'sweet', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'unfortunately', 'so', 'much', 'storyline', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'seen', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'will', 'get', 'chuckle', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'jamming', 'familiar', 'tune', 'other', 'memorable', 'music', 'few', 'cameos', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'here.Recommended', 'rental', 'purposes', 'nostalgia.Amanda', 'Richards', 'July', '27', '2011']",Mayor Cupcake
