Oberkrieser,"[1, 2]","I should probably have more to say, but I think my feelings are pretty simple...I loved ""Spin City"" when it was on TV, so the show going to DVD was a long time coming.  Michael J. Fox has, had, and will always have a witty sense of humor.  The show's writers were amazing, providing the cast with memorable lines and opportunities for great comedy.  The cast members were perfect for each other, and by season 2 everyone was pretty well established in their characters.  I've always loved workplace comedies; ""News Radio,"" ""The Office,"" ""Frasier,"" ""Sports Night.""  If you like any of those, you will also enjoy ""Spin City.""",5,It's about damn time...,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,623,"['should', 'probably', 'have', 'more', 'say', 'think', 'feelings', 'are', 'pretty', 'simple', 'loved', 'Spin', 'City', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'show', 'going', 'DVD', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'had', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'witty', 'sense', 'humor', 'show', 'writers', 'were', 'amazing', 'providing', 'cast', 'memorable', 'lines', 'opportunities', 'great', 'comedy', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'perfect', 'other', 'season', '2', 'everyone', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'established', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'workplace', 'comedies', 'News', 'Radio', 'Office', 'Frasier', 'Sports', 'Night', 'like', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Spin', 'City']",Spin City: Season 2

1222201,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B001O4KBO6,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[5, 6]","New York City's most lovable (if not always savvy) deputy mayor returns to City Hall for more laughs in this 24-episode season two.Getting divorced from Helen, the Mayor then prowls for female companionship.  And in an urbane and cosmopolitan city such as New York, the development would not present a problem. After all, elected officials need companionship too!Except in ""Paul Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". The Mayor's initial attempts at forging new relationships do not go smooth. It's hard to just get out and date when you are an elected official.And in ""Gentleman's Agreement"" he must quickly learn the taboos of having joined a social club which excludes membership from women.Himself the caring father of a daughter (""They Shoot Horses Don't They"") the Mayor does not hate women, he just did not grow up socializing with them as equals.  Uh-oh! Not the best move to navigate the `gender gap' during election time.His good-natured cluelessness again gets deliciously illustrated in the two-parter ""Family Affair"".On a visit to her son the deputy Mayor, Macy Flaherty (a very cleverly-cast Meredith Baxter Birney) and the Mayor start up an innocent but flirty relationship. It REALLY creeps Mike out.This good-hearted but socially nave mayor initially and honestly does not notice Mike's blatant discomfort with their relationship. It's up to his mother to make this all-critical connection...and things right again. She breaks off the relationship.A different kind of uncomfortable social arrangement unfolds when Stuart, the office womanizer becomes Carter Heywood's roommate (""Single White Male""). Their ensuing `out of office' scripts consequently provide reliable hijinks for the rest of this series.Carter gets a solo pivotal episode ""In the Heat of the Day"" when the city police, apparently unaware who the City's ""Minority Liaison"" personally is, apprehend him for a `mugger' during a city park jog.While the police convince themselves they are `preventing crime' through this proactive monitoring, Carter realizes that they targeted him only because of skin color. A white jogger would have been left alone.Having the resources to challenge this stereotyping, he also wants to ensure the police fight crime without unfairly harming law-abiding citizens, including those who cannot fight back with similar resources readily at their disposal.Finally, we cannot forget ""The Goodbye Girl"". This episode is where Stacy Paterno (Jennifer Esposito) comes on board as Mike's wise-cracking, but wise secretary. She will remain with the rest of the series, providing strong chemistryExtras include a featurette on Fox's foundation work.This administration always works around the clock. They reliably deliver first-class comedy to their `constituents'--in New York--and Nationwide!
