1378609,A1IGF1LQJ7JTNN,B00402FG8U,16beest,"[2, 3]","The movie that we wanted to replace was rock-a-doodle.  A story about a rooster who leaves the farm and is kept away by some very interfering owls.  Then it is up to Edmund a little boy (who was turned into a kitty by the grand duke the leader of the owls) and all of the roosters friends back on the farm to find him and bring him home.  There's a lot more to the story that I'm leaving out but I don't want to spoil it.  It's a great family movie for kids 10 and under, or if you watched this as a kid like I did.  The Penguin movie is for kids 5 and under.  It's very cute but definetly for little kids.",5,Rock-a-doodle,1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,606,"['movie', 'wanted', 'replace', 'was', 'rock-a-doodle', 'story', 'rooster', 'who', 'farm', 'kept', 'away', 'very', 'interfering', 'owls', 'Then', 'Edmund', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'turned', 'kitty', 'grand', 'leader', 'owls', 'roosters', 'friends', 'back', 'farm', 'find', 'bring', 'home', 'lot', 'more', 'story', ""'m"", 'leaving', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'kids', '10', 'watched', 'kid', 'did', 'Penguin', 'movie', 'kids', '5', 'very', 'cute', 'definetly', 'little', 'kids']",Pebble & The Penguin/ Rock-A-Doodle

1378612,A2XVEYNWYI2PFM,B00402FG8U,LGW,"[0, 0]","After I heard about this movie I just had to see it because it was about a chicken, and I LOVE Chicken, So after I watched this movie, I thought it was just okay. The story, animation, and the charcter of Chanticleer and his songs were all just fine. The rest were either just okay or just plain bad. For starters, the rest of the characters weren't all that intersting, there really wasn't much to them, they have that just to be there feel to them. The songs from Chanticleer like I said were just fine. The rest songs mostly coming from The Grand Duke of Owls were either okay or just plain pointless. The character of Edmund, while not terrible, he can be pretty annoying.So overall, Rock a Doodle is just okay, if you really want to see it, then this dvd is really worth getting.So lets look at The Pebble and the Penguin, Now unlike Rock a Doodle, this film has a lot more postives and very little negatives. The animation is mostly nice, the voice acting, the characters, the story, and the songs are great. The true negative is that animation while mostly fine has some moments that look unfinshed, like at times, the animation looks incomplte in some scenes, and in the ""Good Ship Misery"" song, there are moments when the charcters are frozen while the song is going. But overall this film is great. So if your just wanting to get this for Rock a Doodle, this is the best deal, and The Pebble and the Penguin is a nice bonus.",4,Bought it for Rock a Doodle,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,1434,"['heard', 'movie', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'was', 'chicken', 'LOVE', 'Chicken', 'watched', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'story', 'animation', 'charcter', 'Chanticleer', 'songs', 'were', 'just', 'fine', 'rest', 'were', 'either', 'just', 'okay', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'starters', 'rest', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'intersting', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'have', 'just', 'be', 'there', 'feel', 'songs', 'Chanticleer', 'said', 'were', 'just', 'fine', 'rest', 'songs', 'mostly', 'coming', 'Grand', 'Duke', 'Owls', 'were', 'either', 'okay', 'just', 'plain', 'pointless', 'character', 'Edmund', 'not', 'terrible', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'annoying.So', 'overall', 'Rock', 'Doodle', 'just', 'okay', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'then', 'dvd', 'really', 'worth', 'getting.So', 'lets', 'look', 'Pebble', 'Penguin', 'Now', 'Rock', 'Doodle', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'postives', 'very', 'little', 'negatives', 'animation', 'mostly', 'nice', 'voice', 'acting', 'characters', 'story', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'true', 'negative', 'animation', 'mostly', 'fine', 'moments', 'look', 'unfinshed', 'times', 'animation', 'incomplte', 'scenes', 'Good', 'Ship', 'Misery', 'song', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'charcters', 'are', 'frozen', 'song', 'going', 'overall', 'film', 'great', 'So', 'just', 'wanting', 'get', 'Rock', 'Doodle', 'best', 'deal', 'Pebble', 'Penguin', 'nice', 'bonus']",Pebble & The Penguin/ Rock-A-Doodle

1378617,A2JEDX851ET4Y8,B00402FG8U,"Pumpkin Toss ""Dearest""","[3, 4]","This release has only one DVD inside of the case. However, one one side is rock a doodle, and the other is Pebble and penguin. If you are a fan of both or only one of these movies you'll feel it's worth the price (cheap) for these films. The quality is like any other dvd (good). The movies, to the best of my knowledge, are uncut...same films that were released in theaters, vhs, and now dvd. There are no special behind the scenes features that are worth mentioning.Rock a doodle is about a rooster named ""Chanticleer"" who raises the sun with his singing. One day the farm he lived in rejects him, and he starts a singing career in ""Pinky Wood"". A boy, who is turned into a cat, goes on a wild adventure looking for dear Chanticlee. It's a good movie, though adults will spot story imperfections.  I loved this silly movie when I was a kid, and still get a kick out of it today. The songs are awesome, some of the characters are really likable, and for a few bucks it's worth buying. The only thing I never cared for was how they made Chanticleer into an Elvis spoof later in the film. I suppose the director thoat this was a cool concept.The pebble and the penguin has never been one of my favorite movies, but I had re-watched it on this dvd. It's about a male penguin who goes on a weird adventure to bring a meteor (the pebble) to the girl he loves. Of course the buff jock penguin wants the girl all to himself,and that is the closest you'll get to any thing resembling a story plot with this film.",5,Still a good movie,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,1505,"['release', 'only', 'one', 'DVD', 'case', 'However', 'one', 'one', 'side', 'rock', 'doodle', 'other', 'Pebble', 'penguin', 'are', 'fan', 'only', 'one', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'price', 'cheap', 'films', 'quality', 'other', 'dvd', 'good', 'movies', 'best', 'knowledge', 'are', 'uncut', 'same', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'theaters', 'vhs', 'now', 'dvd', 'are', 'special', 'scenes', 'features', 'are', 'worth', 'mentioning.Rock', 'doodle', 'rooster', 'named', 'Chanticleer', 'who', 'sun', 'singing', 'One', 'day', 'farm', 'lived', 'rejects', 'singing', 'career', 'Pinky', 'Wood', 'boy', 'who', 'turned', 'cat', 'wild', 'adventure', 'looking', 'dear', 'Chanticlee', 'good', 'movie', 'adults', 'will', 'spot', 'story', 'imperfections', 'loved', 'silly', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'still', 'get', 'kick', 'today', 'songs', 'are', 'awesome', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'likable', 'few', 'bucks', 'worth', 'buying', 'only', 'thing', 'never', 'cared', 'was', 'how', 'made', 'Chanticleer', 'Elvis', 'spoof', 'later', 'film', 'suppose', 'director', 'thoat', 'was', 'cool', 'concept.The', 'pebble', 'penguin', 'never', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'had', 're-watched', 'dvd', 'male', 'penguin', 'who', 'weird', 'adventure', 'bring', 'meteor', 'pebble', 'girl', 'course', 'buff', 'jock', 'penguin', 'girl', 'closest', ""'ll"", 'get', 'thing', 'resembling', 'story', 'plot', 'film']",Pebble & The Penguin/ Rock-A-Doodle
