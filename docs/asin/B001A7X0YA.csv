The plot on this was a little bit thin, not that that matters for a movie aimed at 5 year olds, but a woman who wants to become, not the ruler of the world, but the only ""singing muse""  So she resorts to evil and murder to do so. WHAT?? I had an especially good time explaining to my daughter the scene in which the barmaid pours water over one of the ""player"" princes heads... ""why did she do that mommy?""  ""well you see honey, its because he had sex with her then didn't call her back ever again...this is commonly referred to as a one night stand""  yeah right!No but the music was just okay, silly storyline, and it gets really old how Barbie is just the pillar of morals in every movie... even when she is sharing screen time with her bff, she is still the one who does everything ""perfectly""... figures out the riddle, gives her food to the starving woman, takes Melody on when Alexa wont go, risks her life to switch the mirrors at the beginning, etc.All in all, my girls watch it, but its not the one they ask for.",3,Not Our Fave....,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,1120,"['Well', 'review', 'title', 'stated', 'was', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'yes', 'have', 'plot', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'thin', 'not', 'matters', 'movie', 'aimed', '5', 'year', 'olds', 'woman', 'who', 'become', 'not', 'ruler', 'world', 'only', 'singing', 'muse', 'evil', 'murder', 'do', 'so', 'WHAT', 'had', 'especially', 'good', 'time', 'explaining', 'daughter', 'scene', 'barmaid', 'pours', 'water', 'one', 'player', 'princes', 'heads', 'why', 'did', 'do', 'mommy', 'well', 'see', 'honey', 'had', 'sex', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'call', 'back', 'ever', 'again', 'commonly', 'referred', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'yeah', 'right', 'No', 'music', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'silly', 'storyline', 'really', 'old', 'how', 'Barbie', 'just', 'pillar', 'morals', 'movie', 'even', 'when', 'sharing', 'screen', 'time', 'bff', 'still', 'one', 'who', 'everything', 'perfectly', 'out', 'riddle', 'food', 'starving', 'woman', 'Melody', 'when', 'Alexa', 'wont', 'go', 'life', 'switch', 'mirrors', 'beginning', 'etc.All', 'girls', 'watch', 'not', 'one', 'ask']",Barbie & The Diamond Castle

Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list""","[4, 5]","Really a 3 and a half as far as I am concerned - it is more like Magic of Pegasus than one of the musical's that Barbie has done so well at. My girls and I loved Princess and the Pauper, and the Island one, but this one doesn't really work for me. It is more like Barbie as Rapunzel or Magic of Pegasus - it doesn't have the witty lyrics and great fun the other two musicals have had.This story takes a long time to set up. First there is Barbie and Theresa who are singing, then Barbie's sister comes in and has had a fight with her best friend, so Barbie tells her the story of Alexa and Liana - best friends. By the time the story of Alexa and Liana begins it is a good way into the movie! It is all about sticking together and working together - as friends you can do anything.Even once we get the story of these two it takes a while before the real story begins - where Alexa and Liana have to help Melody defeat the evil Muse and return to Diamond Castle for the Magical instruments.There are two likely lads, but they aren't as mature as they have been in other movies, these are Jack the Lads, with English accents and while they are helpful, they are also somewhat annoying as characters.It is interesting looking at all the tie in merchandise - most of it has very little to do with the story at all - there are flying horses which come in once when the muses are released - a carriage - used once when the girls return to their home right at the end, the little Kelly characters which turn up briefly at the end for less than 2 minutes - and so on.This part of the merchandising really peeves me - at least they could be less cynical about selling stuff - incorporate the figures more fully into the story if you are going to flog them off after.Anyway - it is all right but not fabulous - your little girls will probably like it, but I don't think it will be a family favourite - and take away all the mechandising stuff inside the DVD case before yoru kids start begging for it!",3,"Not the best, but my girls like it - stick to Princess and the pauper",1222905600,"10 2, 2008",2008,1991,"['Really', '3', 'half', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'more', 'Magic', 'Pegasus', 'one', 'musical', 'Barbie', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'girls', 'loved', 'Princess', 'Pauper', 'Island', 'one', 'one', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'more', 'like', 'Barbie', 'Rapunzel', 'Magic', 'Pegasus', ""n't"", 'have', 'witty', 'lyrics', 'great', 'fun', 'other', 'two', 'musicals', 'have', 'had.This', 'story', 'long', 'time', 'set', 'up', 'First', 'Barbie', 'Theresa', 'who', 'are', 'singing', 'then', 'Barbie', 'sister', 'had', 'fight', 'best', 'friend', 'so', 'Barbie', 'story', 'Alexa', 'Liana', 'best', 'friends', 'time', 'story', 'Alexa', 'Liana', 'good', 'way', 'movie', 'sticking', 'together', 'working', 'together', 'friends', 'can', 'do', 'anything.Even', 'once', 'get', 'story', 'two', 'while', 'real', 'story', 'where', 'Alexa', 'Liana', 'have', 'help', 'Melody', 'defeat', 'evil', 'Muse', 'return', 'Diamond', 'Castle', 'Magical', 'are', 'two', 'likely', 'lads', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'mature', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'Jack', 'Lads', 'English', 'accents', 'are', 'helpful', 'are', 'also', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'characters.It', 'interesting', 'looking', 'tie', 'merchandise', 'most', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'story', 'are', 'flying', 'horses', 'come', 'once', 'when', 'muses', 'are', 'released', 'carriage', 'used', 'once', 'when', 'girls', 'return', 'home', 'right', 'end', 'little', 'Kelly', 'characters', 'turn', 'up', 'briefly', 'end', 'less', '2', 'minutes', 'so', 'on.This', 'part', 'merchandising', 'really', 'least', 'could', 'be', 'less', 'cynical', 'selling', 'stuff', 'incorporate', 'figures', 'more', 'fully', 'story', 'are', 'going', 'flog', 'off', 'after.Anyway', 'all', 'right', 'not', 'fabulous', 'little', 'girls', 'will', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'family', 'favourite', 'take', 'away', 'mechandising', 'stuff', 'DVD', 'case', 'yoru', 'kids', 'start', 'begging']",Barbie & The Diamond Castle

In the first scene in which they appear, some women in a tavern are mad at them for one-night stands when they expected love. The men flee and then follow the Barbie girls to try to seduce them. At first the Barbies don't want to have much to do with them and one says ""you're kidding?!""It should be noted here:  is this reviewer AWARE of the age group that these Barbie movies are being marketed to? Do they really think that the children watching this are really going to ""pick-up"" on these kinds of ""messages""?I don't think so.But, be that as it may, here are my thoughts.The Diamond Castle is my favorite of the Barbie movies, (& I have over a dozen of them), because it has an extremely compelling story line, but most of all, because of the music.  I spent many years in music, & the songs, & the importance of music in this movie, are integral to the movies plot.It is an EXTREMELY exciting story, as the race comes down to who can restore things right, between Alexa & Liana to find the castle, & Lydia's attempt to stop them.When Liana & Alexa finally realize how to bring the castle back, that was absolutely brilliant what Liana figured out what the ""key"" really was!NO, taking into account the age group that these Barbie movies are marketed to, I see no problem with this or any of the other Barbie movies.BTW: I am a 57 y/o male who also runs an online animation forum, so I have a much less ""biased"" view of this movie!I MOST definitely recommend this movie!",5,To clear up a few misconceptions...........,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,1593,"['..about', 'movie', 'One', 'negative', 'review', 'said', 'two', 'princely', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'princes', 'instead', 'Lotharios', 'first', 'scene', 'appear', 'women', 'tavern', 'are', 'mad', 'one-night', 'stands', 'when', 'expected', 'love', 'men', 'flee', 'then', 'follow', 'Barbie', 'girls', 'try', 'seduce', 'first', 'Barbies', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'one', ""'re"", 'kidding', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'here', 'reviewer', 'AWARE', 'age', 'group', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'are', 'being', 'marketed', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'children', 'watching', 'are', 'really', 'going', 'pick-up', 'kinds', 'messages', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.But', 'be', 'may', 'here', 'are', 'thoughts.The', 'Diamond', 'Castle', 'favorite', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'have', 'over', 'dozen', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'story', 'line', 'most', 'music', 'spent', 'many', 'years', 'music', 'songs', 'importance', 'music', 'movie', 'are', 'integral', 'movies', 'plot.It', 'EXTREMELY', 'exciting', 'story', 'race', 'down', 'who', 'can', 'restore', 'things', 'right', 'Alexa', 'Liana', 'find', 'castle', 'Lydia', 'attempt', 'stop', 'them.When', 'Liana', 'Alexa', 'finally', 'realize', 'how', 'bring', 'castle', 'back', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'what', 'Liana', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'key', 'really', 'was', 'NO', 'taking', 'account', 'age', 'group', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'are', 'marketed', 'see', 'problem', 'other', 'Barbie', 'movies.BTW', 'am', '57', 'y/o', 'male', 'who', 'also', 'online', 'animation', 'forum', 'have', 'much', 'less', 'biased', 'view', 'movie', 'MOST', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie']",Barbie & The Diamond Castle

Up to now, the DVDs have had classic stories with age appropriate dialogue and sequences. The Barbie DVDs remain delightfully innocent and playful.This latest DVD starts from the outset hinting at lesbian tendencies in the songs (which may confuse young viewers as to the intent behind the words). This theme is reinforced by two smooth tongued men seeking sex with the two heroines. They evolve in helping the two friends and end up looking like frat boys with good hearts. At the conclusion, it is left somewhat ambiguous as two whether Barbie and her best friend are indeed straight. There are some nice special effects, like the redone Stargate Atlantis ""castle"" rising from the water. Rainmaker Effects took the same dazzling sequence and cartooned it up and made it girly, to represent the Diamond Castle, instead of the city of Atlantis, from the hit SciFi TV show.While not an open declaration of lesbian celebration, this latest Barbie DVD is quite a departure from the sweet and innocent titles so far to date.

1165386,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B001A7X0YA,Marshall Lord,"[33, 39]","This latest Barbie video, a cross between ""Best Friends"" and fairytale, is one of the more original films Mattel have produced and my seven-year old children thoroughly enjoyed it.It begins with Barbie and Teresa practicing a guitar duet when a smaller girl bursts in having just had a terrible row with her best friend. Barbie starts to tell her a story of two friends who were put in great danger because each thought her friend had betrayed her, but their friendship won out in the end ...The friends concerned, Liana and Alexa, share everything, including their love of music. One day they are given a magic mirror - and find a girl, Melody, magically hiding inside it.Melody is an apprentice to the three muses who use the magical ""Diamond castle"" to inspire and spread music through the land. Unfortunately one of the muses, Lydia, wants to be the sole ruler of music. With the aid of her magical flute and an evil winged serpent called Slider, Lydia has turned her fellow muses to stone. Melody has the secret key to the Diamond castle, so Lydia and Slider are searching for her.Alexa and Liana set out to help Melody rescue the petrified muses and overthrow Lydia - they will face dangers and deception along the way.The story is one of friendship rather than romance, but ""Ken"" makes an appearance as Ian and Jeremy, a pair of rascally but warm-hearted twins who are travelling musicians. Ian and Jeremy share the role of comic relief with two adorable puppies, Sparkles and Lily: the twins have been given some quite amusing dialogue with plenty of ironic banter, probably intended to keep adults who are watching the film with their offspring amused.Before we first rented one of the Barbie videos for my daughter, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, over-sugary and over here. However, I have been pleasantly surprised.Yes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccarine count, but the quality of the Barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented, including ""The Diamond Castle"" was significantly higher than I would have originally expected, and the quality has kept rising as each successive Barbie film seems to be more beautifully made than the last. They have not just kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - but introduced them to some beautiful stories and truly wonderful music.Prsonally I love classical music and want my children to have the opportunity to learn to appreciate it. So it was a big positive for me when I was listening to CDs of classics such as Beethoven's pastoral symphony, or ""The Queen of the Night's aria"" from Mozart's magic flute, and my daughter, then aged five, recognised the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. (""Magic of Pegasus"" and ""Mermaidia"" respectively.)With one exception the soundtrack to ""The Diamond Castle"" isn't taken from the classics, the songs in the musical are all modern. (The exception is a pastiche of Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" which plays when the castle finally appears near the climax of the film. The orchestral accompaniment was recorded by a top rank classical orchestra, the Czech Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra. In my opinion Arnie Roth, who conducted the orchestra and co wrote the music with David Blamire, did a good job of it - almost as good the music he wrote for ""The Princess and the Pauper"" which has the best soundtrack of those Barbie films which have new music rather than raiding the classics.Those people who enjoy criticising what the Barbie franchise represents will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then this film and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them.And the female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility: I'm not worried that watching this is going to give my own daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality. However, if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy female body shape is, it is not quite impossible that this film may contribute to it.Barbie is often accused of reinforcing gender stereotyping, but I don't think the charge is entirely fair, and even less for this film than most of the others - insofar as gender stereotypes are present in ""The Diamond Castle"" the film appears to be taking the mickey out of them.On the plus side: it is beautifully made, it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so.Or alternatively, if you want to watch it with your children, there are a fair number of more sophisticated jokes thrown in to keep you amused.",4,"Another treat for little girls (and boys),",1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,4897,"['latest', 'Barbie', 'video', 'cross', 'Best',

Barbie's faceher face is so different! It's morphing into a more plastic-y form. The nose is tiny, and her eyes aren't as deep and beautiful a blue.2. The movies are becoming so different. No romance! Call me crazy but I personally love true-love romance (like in Swan Lake, where the two lovers loved each other more than themselves and would die to save the other. Mmm... :) so sweet.)3. The dogs, Lily and Sparkles, aren't like real puppies at all. They practically talk to their humans and walk on two feet! I prefer the cats on the Princess and the Pauper. Much more realistic, and cuter, too!Other than that, this is a very enjoyable movie. The princes, I must admit are wierd and make you uncomfortable at times, but they are funny in their sarcastic, carefree manner and faked arrogance. And they are far more handsome than some of the other princes. (i.e. Louis, from the 3musketeers, who is the worst-looking prince I've ever seen in a barbie movie.) I didn't really care for the way Liana and Alexa's dresses magically changed at the gateway. There's always a change from Barbie's old, plain dress to the signature, fancy, movie-cover dress, and they were just trying to get that change in there, and a little magic is good for little girls. And it turned out looking kinda cheesy. But the other parts are much more mature and interesting for older girls. It's aimed more towards preteens and early teens. Adults might enjoy, too. I love this movie and I'm glad to see some more mature issues without being too mature and keeping the magical little-girl sense. But one more thing, something other reviews have said was that the girls were lesbian. WHAT? Come on people, when you were little, wasn't it your dream for your very best friend to live in the same house as you? I used to imagine we were sisters, so I could be with her every day. Don't make something like that up and smear mud on a kid's movie. If this were an adult movie, sure, it'd be concerning, but it's not! It's a movie for little girls who know nothing about that and I hate to see parents going, ""oh, they must be lesbian"" and thus having to explain to their kids why they tossed the movie out.
