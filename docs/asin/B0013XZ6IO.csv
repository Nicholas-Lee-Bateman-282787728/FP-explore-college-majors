The camera work was great, giving you a better option to see the various players as if you had a telescope.  The music was wonderful.  We intend to do this again.

What I both loved and then wasn't sure about was the fact that i finally knew in english what the vocalists were singing.  I had been curious before whenever I heard the 9th but wasn't really concerned because one doesn't have to know the words to appreciate the beauty of the music.  When sung in foreign language, you sort of  imagine what the words are  when you hear them.  And thus  sometimes when you know the translation, the reality often can fall  short of the imagination.  The beauty of the Ninth to me was not dependent on the religious nature of the words and I almost prefer not to know the English.  On the DVD you have the option to go at it either way, with or without the titles.  Whatever, but  I liked having the subtitles and they weren't in any way a nuisance to me.  Anyone who has purchased the Lara Fabian concert DVD's would understand.  Something can be lost in the translation, but not so here.  And the soloists were very good if not excellent.  I am not a professional reviewer and not technically all that knowledgable but i don't think enjoyment requires that level.  I do know this is likely the most intense conductor ever but i have always loved seeing him work.  I don't know if a better performance exists on DVD, if so I would love to have it but this one satisfies me on all levels.",5,"Intensity, intensity and more.",1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,1391,"['was', 'stunning', 'work', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'performance', 'What', 'loved', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'fact', 'finally', 'knew', 'english', 'what', 'vocalists', 'were', 'singing', 'had', 'been', 'curious', 'whenever', 'heard', '9th', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'concerned', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'know', 'words', 'appreciate', 'beauty', 'music', 'When', 'sung', 'foreign', 'language', 'sort', 'imagine', 'what', 'words', 'are', 'when', 'hear', 'thus', 'sometimes', 'when', 'know', 'translation', 'reality', 'often', 'can', 'fall', 'short', 'imagination', 'beauty', 'Ninth', 'was', 'not', 'dependent', 'religious', 'nature', 'words', 'almost', 'prefer', 'not', 'know', 'English', 'DVD', 'have', 'option', 'go', 'way', 'titles', 'Whatever', 'liked', 'having', 'subtitles', 'were', ""n't"", 'way', 'nuisance', 'Anyone', 'who', 'purchased', 'Lara', 'Fabian', 'concert', 'DVD', 'would', 'understand', 'Something', 'can', 'be', 'lost', 'translation', 'not', 'so', 'here', 'soloists', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'excellent', 'am', 'not', 'professional', 'reviewer', 'not', 'technically', 'knowledgable', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'enjoyment', 'level', 'do', 'know', 'likely', 'most', 'intense', 'conductor', 'ever', 'i', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'seeing', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'performance', 'exists', 'DVD', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'one', 'levels']",N/A
1144363,A2JT1O6JIN3DOE,B0013XZ6IO,"RaabH ""Rob""","[14, 15]","Aside from featuring a superb performance of Beethoven's (and arguably music's) greatest symphony, this DVD also delivers an exciting and unintrusive visual experience thanks to the thoughtful direction of Sir Humphrey Burton. Unlike later video productions of the BPO that were directed by Karajan himself, this one does not attempt any fancy video effects or spend too much time focusing on the conductor. Instead the camera seems to instinctively know what we want to see, whether it is a particular instrumental or vocal soloist, the entire orchestra tearing into a climax, or the moment in the fourth movement when the chorus finally stands up after being seated for over an hour.Since I grew up admiring Karajan's work and particularly have enjoyed his recordings from the 60's and 70's, this production provided a fantastic opportunity for me to watch him conduct a live concert when he was at the height of his fame. Remarkably, he stands before the orchestra with no podium and no score, and shows an economy of gesture that is perhaps the direct opposite of the more demonstrative style of his contemporary Leonard Bernstein.Video and sound quality are both excellent, especially considering their 1970's vintage.",5,A great orchestra and their conductor at their peak,1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,1223,"['Aside', 'featuring', 'superb', 'performance', 'Beethoven', 'arguably', 'music', 'greatest', 'symphony', 'DVD', 'also', 'exciting', 'unintrusive', 'visual', 'experience', 'thanks', 'thoughtful', 'direction', 'Sir', 'Humphrey', 'Burton', 'later', 'video', 'productions', 'BPO', 'were', 'directed', 'Karajan', 'one', 'not', 'attempt', 'fancy', 'video', 'effects', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'focusing', 'conductor', 'Instead', 'camera', 'instinctively', 'know', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'particular', 'instrumental', 'vocal', 'soloist', 'entire', 'orchestra', 'tearing', 'climax', 'moment', 'fourth', 'movement', 'when', 'chorus', 'finally', 'up', 'being', 'seated', 'hour.Since', 'grew', 'up', 'admiring', 'Karajan', 'work', 'particularly', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'recordings', '60', '70', 'production', 'provided', 'fantastic', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'conduct', 'live', 'concert', 'when', 'was', 'height', 'fame', 'Remarkably', 'orchestra', 'podium', 'score', 'economy', 'gesture', 'perhaps', 'direct', 'opposite', 'more', 'demonstrative', 'style', 'contemporary', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein.Video', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'considering', '1970', 'vintage']",N/A
1144364,A2QLUJK62YAJSF,B0013XZ6IO,Terry,"[2, 2]","This is one of my all time favorite videos.  I have it on VHS, which is the main reason I kept my VHS player hooked up.  I was waiting for the dvd, and here it is!  Beethoven is my favorite composer, and this is my favorite piece of music ever.  I also admire Karajan conducting, and will buy his version of productions first, especially the Germanic composers.  Besides the performance, what I like about this video is that the filming lets you see the whole orchestra, and is a better concert experience.  I thought I bought this performance on dvd a few years back, but it was a different version that relied too much on close ups of the instruments and Karajan's baton.  Not the case here.  Best of all, look at Karajan's face at the end of the performance, and the kiss to the orchestra.
