To forgive for no...","[0, 0]","""Here's the mail; it never fails.It makes me want to wag my tail.When it comes I want to wail....MAIL!""Hands down, Blue's Clues is the only real rival to Sesame Street (my opinion) in regards to children's programming.  The show was developed by a Nickelodeon team with child development consultants and educators.  Blue's Clues is essentially about a young man (Steve) who's puppy (Blue) wants to do something new at the beginning of every episode and since Blue can't talk, it's ours and Steve's job to figure out what Blue wants to do by piecing together the clues that Blue leaves around the house, or backyard, or wherever.  The majority of the songs in the show are repetitive, fun and easy to learn so both you and your children can sing them together.  About 2 months ago when my child was 11 months old she started throwing her hands up in the air after hearing the ""Mail Song"" - lol.  My husband and I didn't even know she had been paying attention that much to the show!  We also started noticing that when the show was about to end and Steve was singing the goodbye song, she would wave at the screen.  Clearly, the creators of Blue's Clues have put together a show that knows how to catch a child's attention and gets them to respond.Another nicety about Blue's Clues is that for the most part it is peaceful (lol).  Much of children's programming (even some of the really good ones on PBS) are way too chaotic.  It seems like some of these shows are going so fast that the child watching doesn't have time to think about what is being asked of them... no wonder attention spans have dropped significantly.  Blue's Clues actually has a conversation with the kids watching and with the other characters on the show.  They are not yelling at each other, zipping to and fro all over the place or flashing different scenes at you within a nano-second which allows kids watching to process the information they've been given!Sesame Street is still tops, but Blue's Clues is very close and worth 5 stars!""And now it's time for so long,but we'll sing just one more song.Thanks for doing your part,you sure are smart.You know with me and youand my dog BlueWe can do anything that we wanna do!""The songs are so catchy and fun that I couldn't resist listing a few lines!",5,"""mail time, Mail Time, MAIL TIME!""

784132,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B0000UJLAK,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[103, 107]","""Classic Clues"" is truly classic in that the episodes on it are never-before-seen episodes featuring Steve, the classic host of the show before his ""brother,"" Joe, took over in the fifth season. Most of the other favorite characters are around too, all as delighful as always.Viewers who were turned off by the seemingly rushed format of the school activities depicted in ""Blue Takes You to School"" will delight in Blue's pretend school in ""Blue's School."" Even though the episode is the same length as any other episode, everything just seems a lot less rushed and more with a sense of fun. ""Something to Do Blue"" features a fairly decent song that previously could only be heard on one of the ""Blue's Clues"" albums. It also teaches neat ways for beating boredom by encouraging imagination.Steve is in fine form in both of these ""lost"" episodes featured on this video. Twice he's seen with a guitar, although that doesn't work out quite as he would probably like! His interactions with Pawprint are as fun as ever and he's even up to his old, classic, sock puppet mischief.The only thing that I should post a caution about is that the video, like other such videos, contains about ten minutes of promos at the very beginning for pretty much every current Nick Jr. show and related DVDs and videos. So unless that actually holds you or your kids' interest, I would recommend fast-forwarding at the start by about that amount and remembering to rewind only back to the point.All-in-all, this is an important video (or DVD, should you choose that option) that shouldn't be missed by fans of the show, especially since these episodes will probably never be aired on television.",5,"Steve, It's a ""Classic Clue!""
