1259373,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B002B5AWDM,Artist & Author,"[6, 17]","Frankly, I was disappointed in this movie.  We see a day in the life of a girl living in horrible conditions, one who is a talented basketball player, but we see nothing of what she did to better herself or how she did it.  All of Charles Dickens's or Horatio Alger's characters grew up in situations just as bad as Agnes.  But, their stories are really about how the boys or girls managed to better their situation to become successful as adults.  There is none of that in this movie other than a little statement at the end that says Agnes grew up to write and direct the movie.  I felt that this was the first of a trilogy of movies, with the second - her struggle to overcome her situation and to be accepted as an honorable person - and the third - what she has done to become successful as an adult - missing.I might add that we have had over 150 kids stay with us over the years, and quite a few were from situations quite similar to that of Agnes, including children of prostitutes.  Both my father and grandfather were 'slumlords' in Detroit and Atlanta, and we got to know many children from horrible situations.  But, they knew that we loved each one and that we treated them with dignity.  The kids would run to my grandfather and he'd hug them like he did his own grandchildren.  I remember one seven-year-old girl who one time jumped into my arms with a ragged dress and panties so dirty they left my clothes smelling.  But, how could I help but give such an eager little soul a hug and tell her she was very special?  Most of the kids were satisfied to stay in the slums, but every once in a while one would stand out - we called them 'superkids' - and seek us out for mentoring.  Many are now successful adults.I've never heard of one of those 'at risk' children who became a successful adult who did not have at least one adult in his or her life who challenged and encouraged them.  We see none of this in this movie.  Is the writer saying that she became successful without any outside encouragement?  Without seeing some evidence of how she overcame her circumstances, just following a typical day in the life of a girl growing up in horrible circumstances is ultimately unsatisfying.",3,Too Much is Missing,1272412800,"04 28, 2010",2010,2204,"['Frankly', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'see', 'day', 'life', 'girl', 'living', 'horrible', 'conditions', 'one', 'who', 'talented', 'basketball', 'player', 'see', 'nothing', 'what', 'did', 'better', 'how', 'did', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Horatio', 'Alger', 'characters', 'grew', 'up', 'situations', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'Agnes', 'stories', 'are', 'really', 'how', 'boys', 'girls', 'managed', 'better', 'situation', 'become', 'successful', 'adults', 'none', 'movie', 'other', 'little', 'statement', 'end', 'Agnes', 'grew', 'up', 'write', 'direct', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'first', 'trilogy', 'movies', 'second', 'struggle', 'overcome', 'situation', 'be', 'accepted', 'honorable', 'person', 'third', 'what', 'done', 'become', 'successful', 'adult', 'missing.I', 'might', 'add', 'have', 'had', '150', 'kids', 'stay', 'years', 'quite', 'few', 'were', 'situations', 'quite', 'similar', 'Agnes', 'including', 'children', 'prostitutes', 'father', 'grandfather', 'were', ""'slumlords"", 'Detroit', 'Atlanta', 'got', 'know', 'many', 'children', 'horrible', 'situations', 'knew', 'loved', 'one', 'treated', 'dignity', 'kids', 'would', 'run', 'grandfather', ""'d"", 'hug', 'did', 'own', 'grandchildren', 'remember', 'one', 'seven-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'one', 'time', 'jumped', 'arms', 'ragged', 'dress', 'panties', 'so', 'left', 'clothes', 'smelling', 'how', 'could', 'help', 'give', 'such', 'eager', 'little', 'soul', 'hug', 'tell', 'was', 'very', 'special', 'Most', 'kids', 'were', 'satisfied', 'stay', 'slums', 'once', 'while', 'one', 'would', 'stand', 'out', 'called', ""'superkids"", 'seek', 'out', 'mentoring', 'Many', 'are', 'now', 'successful', 'adults.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'one', ""'at"", 'risk', 'children', 'who', 'became', 'successful', 'adult', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'adult', 'life', 'who', 'challenged', 'encouraged', 'see', 'none', 'movie', 'writer', 'saying', 'became', 'successful', 'outside', 'encouragement', 'seeing', 'evidence', 'how', 'overcame', 'circumstances', 'just', 'following', 'typical', 'day', 'life', 'girl', 'growing', 'up', 'horrible', 'circumstances', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying']",The Poker House
