It's funny, sad and it really does make you think.  All she really wanted was to love a certain someone.  However, facing rejection, her view is changed, and she goes through several changes before finding ""herself"" in a physical way.  This is a person in whom many may be able to relate (in some form or fashion).  I'm going to get a copy for myself to enjoy.

1410708,A29YYQA9H58WAP,B004IFYMUW,"Serious Reader ""mstanford7""","[10, 11]","I will admit, One of the main reasons I wanted to see this movie was because of the buzz about it being one of the most sexually explicit movies ever made in the non-porn industry. I didn't really expect to find the movie interesting, I just wanted to see what everyone was talking about.The first minute or so was nothing but explicit sex and I almost turned the movie off thinking it was going to be pointless, that this was all there was to the movie, but I had nothing better to do so I kept watching.This movie is not porn, nor is it erotica. This movie IS an uncensored look at the truth about love and sex, and is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is brutally honest, thought provoking, intense at times, and funny at others. These are characters that we can relate to, because they are real.I can not say enough positive things about this movie, it is art, it is truth, it is exceptional.",4,Another work of art from LEE,1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,915,"['will', 'admit', 'One', 'main', 'reasons', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'buzz', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'non-porn', 'industry', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'find', 'movie', 'interesting', 'just', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'everyone', 'was', 'talking', 'first', 'minute', 'so', 'was', 'nothing', 'explicit', 'sex', 'almost', 'turned', 'movie', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'pointless', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'so', 'kept', 'watching.This', 'movie', 'not', 'porn', 'erotica', 'movie', 'uncensored', 'look', 'truth', 'love', 'sex', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'brutally', 'honest', 'thought', 'provoking', 'intense', 'times', 'funny', 'others', 'are', 'characters', 'can', 'relate', 'are', 'real.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'positive', 'things', 'movie', 'art', 'truth', 'exceptional']",N/A
