Full of symbolism and clues along the way, Patricia Arquette is brilliant as the Stigmatic and Gabriel Byrne who plays the priest trying to save her, equally so.This film received mixed reviews in the UK, some of them not too flattering, I am just so glad that I watched it regardless.  The soundtrack is wicked, so much so, I bought the CD.Some people have taken this film as an affront to religion, I did not see it that way at all, on the contrary, the wounds of Christ that were appearing on the character in the film sent a thousand and one messages out to the viewer.I have seen this film five times now and I know, that I will watch it again, thoroughly enjoyable with a very different storyline.Keep an eye open for the small text at the end of the film regarding the hidden gospel, because that really does make you think.",5,Great film - I would watch this again,1039564800,"12 11, 2002",2002,960,"['Stigmata', 'was', 'intriguing', 'intensely', 'watchable', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'storyline', 'as', 'good', 'get', 'Full', 'symbolism', 'clues', 'way', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'brilliant', 'Stigmatic', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'who', 'priest', 'trying', 'save', 'equally', 'so.This', 'film', 'received', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'UK', 'not', 'too', 'flattering', 'am', 'just', 'so', 'glad', 'watched', 'regardless', 'soundtrack', 'wicked', 'so', 'much', 'bought', 'CD.Some', 'people', 'have', 'taken', 'film', 'affront', 'religion', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'way', 'contrary', 'wounds', 'Christ', 'were', 'appearing', 'character', 'film', 'sent', 'thousand', 'one', 'viewer.I', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'five', 'times', 'now', 'know', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'different', 'storyline.Keep', 'eye', 'open', 'small', 'text', 'end', 'film', 'regarding', 'hidden', 'gospel', 'really', 'make', 'think']",Stigmata VHS

They made the movie look like it was a modern day Exorcist, which it isn't. It is a story about faith, with stupendous performances by Gabriel Byrne (this man is amazing, and so expressive without ever saying a word or going over the top), Patricia Arquette, Rade Serbedzija and Jonathan Pryce (who gives a chilling performance). Rupert Wainwright does a great job directing this religious drama/thriller. His choice of camera angles and moves, as well as the special processing ('skip bleaching') of the film stock help add to the surrealness of the film. Rounding it out is an amazing score by three different artists--Billy Corgan (of the Smashing Pumpkins), Mike Garson (a world renouned pianist), and film composer Elia Cmiral. Together these artists have created a strong film.The dvd contains a commentary track from the director, deleted scenes, Natalie Imbruglia's vidoe for ""Identify"", which Corgan and Garson wrote (and the video is filmed in an interesting way--it is worth watching, regardless of how you feel about the song).

474144,A1GS2EXQFPJH6,6305718903,Alamo_guy,"[3, 4]",STIGMATA is an erotically crafted tale of suspense. I suppose it can be classified as a close cousin to the genre that brought us THE EXORCIST yet looks visually closer to DON'T LOOK NOW. Gabriel Byrne once again delivers a lethargically quintessential performance as a priest who dutifully fulfills his assignments ordered by arbitrary leadership from the Vatican. The plot is almost superficial to the highly stylistic visual aura that is employed here.  Patricia Arquette's nude scene in the bathtub is a captivatingly alluring piece of erotica beautifully photographed and edited. Her naked beauty and the wounds that her body undergoes mesmerize Bern as he begins to investigate Arquette's s manifestations of the STIGMATA. The lashing and scourging montage of Arquest's exquisitely arched naked back as her quivering flesh wrenches lash after lash to an almost climatic utterance of screams is unusually enthralling and alluring.

It reminds me of the ambient(Trip Hop Music) that I love so much. This movie has a very dark and gothic vibe too it which I feel is beautifully filmed. Patricia Arquette is one of the best at conveying quirky or unusual characters. For an hour and 47 mins, you are definitley in Frankie Page's world. I know that a lot of Christians will have a problem with the message that this film is trying to convey. And I think that is one of the reasons it didn't do as well as it should have. I love it because you rarely get a film that goes into a persons life style as this one did.&quot;Very Brief Plot to this Story!&quot;Frankie Page (Patricia Arquette)is a beautiful alternative female that is d'void of faith. She is extremley egotistical, and very spoiled to some extent. She is possessed by a preacher that died before he could convey the pages that were hidden in the Bible. So basically she recieves the Stigmata because the preacher she is possessed by had it, and she is his messenger. Basically a self proclaimed atheist, recieves a quick lesson that God does exist. Now the whole stigmata is a gift thing,I don't quite understand? Also I don't understand why a Preacher would possess a womans body and act in such a belligerent manner? But anyway, the Church doesn't want this secret out and will do anything to protect it, Including homocide! See Patricia in &quot;Lost Highway -(Masterpiece) and Goodbye Lover&quot; another interesting experience. The soundtrack is very trippy and I recommend it as well.

For those who want to automatically call it an EXORCIST rip off, it certainly is not.  The story is very different and fully based on the presence of the stigmata.The story is original, believable and much effort is put into the special effects.  But the script does not totally flow and the scares and suspense just aren't really there.  Maybe it is overproduced.  Again, the acting is superb.  patricia Arquette has an acting tour de force as Frankie, the young woman who is stricken by the stigmata as is Gabriel Byrne as Father Kiernan the investigative priest sent to study her.  They also play very well off each other.  Also, each scene in which she is stricken by another sign of the stigmata is very efefectively shown.But all the other pieces just don't mesh.  I think the producers and writers took on too much and didn't give the movie and storyline the dedication it deserved.  It is certainly not a bad movie and has some of the best acting you will ever see.  But Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne are certainly let down by the material they are given.  They carry it as best they can.Had this film been handled more carefully it could have become a very important, popular film with a message that put it in the same genre as THE EXORCIST but kept it a standout film in its own right.  People see the clips etc. and think its just another film about a possessed girl.  This is so not true and sadly the opportunity to tell the story well is wasted as is the excellent acting.

474167,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6305718903,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 4]","Stigmata isn't painful, but it does have the stigma of not being very good. It is a horror film but in this case the monster that terrorizes our young protagonist is Jesus Christ--or someone carrying a message from him. It compares to The Exorcist and The DaVinci Code, but is not as good as either. By straddling the two genres of horror and dramatic Vatican thriller, it succeeds at neither. The stigmata scenes aren't scary and they overuse sloppy special effects. Why is there always water dripping, and why does Frankie Paige, a hairdresser in Pittsburgh, always smell flowers whenever she is having an episode? And how do two hairdressers living together afford such a large albeit somewhat scummy but artfully decorated loft?The film is based on an interesting premise, that the Vatican is suppressing certain gospels that have turned up by Peter, Mary Magdalene and even Judas. This plot pivots around one written by Thomas--and such a text does exist though its veracity is questioned. The film, however, is a little sloppy with the details, claiming it was written in Aramaic, a language spoken in Jesus' day, but it is actually in Coptic, an ancient Egyptian language based on the Greek alphabet. Here is a quote from Stigmata that was taken from The Gospel of Thomas, verse 77:-------------------------[Frankie is possessed by Father Alameida]Frankie: Jesus said... the Kingdom of God is inside you, and all around you, not in mansions of wood and stone. Split a piece of wood... and I am there, lift a stone... and you will find me.-------------------------At one point our stigmatized hairdresser ostensibly writes Aramaic on the walls of her loft, but the director actually had her write in ancient Hebrew because he thought it looked cooler. But I quibble. I am not sure if, as Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) claims, that St Francis of Assisi was the first to receive stigmata, but I have a whole pack of fact checkers working on it and you will be the first to know should they unearth any verification. Another interesting factoid gleaned from Father Kiernan was that the nails in a crucifixion actually go through the wrists, because palms couldn't support the weight. This is in spite of all the crucifixes you see showing the nail through the palm. Another Vatican cover up?Though not a great film, it is at least mildly entertaining, with performances by Patricia Arquette as Frankie Paige--the stigmatized hair dresser, Gabriel Byrne, Enrico Colantoni as Father Dario, and Jonathan Pryce as the sinister Cardinal Daniel Houseman.Patricia's character, Frankie, for short, is named Francis, and this is an allusion to St. Francis of Assisi, the first person believed to be stigmatized. Patricia is younger sister to Rosanna Arquette, and also a sister to David Arquette, and therefore is sister-in-law to Courtney Cox. She is also the grand daughter of star of stage and screen, Cliff Arquette, best known for the character 'Charlie Weaver' that he created for the Jack Paar Show. An interesting bit of Patricia trivia is that Tom Waits' wife called Patricia a Bonsai Aphrodite, and Tom used that line in the song ""Black Market Baby"" from The Mule Variations. She is quite the Bonsai Aphrodite, though I didn't recognize her at first, but upon further investigation I found that she played the medium, Allison Dubois, on the TV program: Medium.-------------------------[Frankie is possessed by Father Alameida]Father Andrew Kiernan: Frankie? Frankie... who are you?Frankie: The messenger is not important.-------------------------If, as Marshall McLuhan posits, The Medium is the Message, and the messenger is not important, what does that portend?Other Patricia Arquette film credits include Ed Wood, with Johnny Depp; Little Nicky, with Adam Sandler; a dual role in Lost Highway, directed by David Lynch; and finally, she played Linda Loveless opposite Charlie Sheen, who (in quite a stretch) portrayed Chuck Traynor, in Deeper Than Deep. Though Stigmata is not her best work, she at least had the best line:-------------------------Dr. Reston: And are there any problems with a significant other?Frankie: Yes...Dr. Reston: Which is?Frankie: I'm not very significant.-------------------------This could serve as the film's epitaph.Gabriel Byrne was the priest who investigates miracles and debunks them with science. Byrne is from Dublin, and his slight bit o' brogue didn't seem out of place on a Catholic Priest. I last recall seeing him in Little Women with Winona Ryder, but he also played Byron in Gothic, and was one of the usual suspects in The Usual Suspects. In 1999, besides Stigmata, Byrne was also in The End Days. Both performances earned him Razzies for worst supporting actor, but Stigmata also won him a best supporting actor award--but it was from Blockbuster.Jonathan Pryce is probably now best known for playing Governor Weatherbee Swann from The Pirates of the Caribbean. I liked his off beat brother-in-law Norman in The Rachel Papers far better. Other notable films worth the Pryce were Brazil, Glengarry Glen Ross, and De-Lovely. De-Lovely was a bio pic of Cole Porter starring Kevin Kline, and Pryce's character Gabe sang Porter's ""Blow, Gabriel, Blow."" However, as the embodiment of Vatican corruption and cover-up in Stigmata, he didn't really measure up to my expectations.-------------------------Cardinal Daniel Houseman: [while trying to strangle Frankie] I'll not let you destroy my church!-------------------------Not buying it, Pryce!Enrico Colantoni might be familiar to you from Just Shoot Me! where he played the photographer, or from Veronica Mars where he played Veronica's father, a former cop turned private eye. Now he is playing a SWAT cop on a new show, Flashpoint, but we will see if that isn't just another flash-in-the-pan.According to the credits, Portia de Rossi played Jennifer Kelliho in Stigmata, but I would have to watch it again to see who she was and how she does. Portia has also had her most successful roles on television, notably as ""Ice Queen"" lawyer Nell Porter on Ally McBeal, Lindsay Bluth F&uuml;nke on Arrested Development, and Olivia Lord on Nip/Tuck. By the way, Portia married Ellen DeGeneres on August 16, 2008 at Ellen's house in Beverly Hills, California attended by Ellen's mother and her mother.

Another in a long series of movies apparently put together by music-video directors, Stigmata attempts to cover up its hole-ridden plot with a lot of jump-cuts, cross-fades, and tiresome montages. There are a few interesting visual ideas, but you get the feeling that's the only thing the director brought to the movie, since the screenplay has no real meat. The characters are typically one-dimensional and live only to serve the plot. Many times during the movie, you can see them jump up and walk angrily out of the shot, or deliver a dramatic one-liner and exit (usually to another jump-cut), precisely when the dialogue would force them to say something substantive, or force the screenplay to tip its hand and reveal that there's no real meat to the story. The actors do fine with the roles they're given, but frankly, those roles don't amount to much. Every time this movie comes close to doing something genuine, it hides behind another blaring music-video montage, and ultimately, that's all it has going for it.

474176,A9QXVJYKCFPNH,6305718903,"Dave Y. ""nobody777""","[5, 7]","This movie, often billed under the category of &quot;supernatural thriller&quot; or &quot;horror movie&quot;, in my opinion is difficult to define entirely by either label though I suppose it has its moments which allude to these descriptions. Stigmata presents a good story, complete with intrigue and emotion, nice special effects and a quite surprisingly hard hitting message that leaves the viewer with some measurable food for contemplation.The story is about a 23-year-old hairdresser by the name of Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) who also happens to be an atheist. She's just an ordinary non-religious person, with ordinary friends. After Frankie's mother sends her a gift, which happens to be a cross from a deceased stigmata priest in Brazil, things change. She begins to experience the phenomenon of stigmata; bleeding like Jesus Christ did on the cross with wounds appearing in her hands, feet, head and back. Frankie's stigmata experience is also accompanied by intense visions of the crucifixion of Christ which are portrayed more violently and dramatically then I had seen in any other movie which depicted the crucifixion of Jesus. Frankie's disturbing encounters, which she can't understand, causes her to go to doctors and psychologists who determine she must either be suicidal or epileptic. Her chance encounter with a local Catholic priest brings a Vatican investigator, Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne), to document her episodes. Confronted with the powerful force that has taken control of Frankie, Kiernen immediately recognizes this phenomenon as an actual miracle of God. She has become a messenger for God to reveal a lost Gospel supposed to have been written by Jesus Himself. This revelation uncovers a conspiracy to keep the Catholic Church, not Jesus, as central to faith. Former priests come forward to validate the truth of this so-called Gospel by Jesus. Frankie and Andrew develop a unique friendship as the film progresses, and eventually both are met individually with their own confrontation of the question of faith over religion as well as to deal with the conspiracy at hand which has some officials in the ranks of the Catholic Church prepared to pursue whatever means necessary to silence the messenger and the Gospel she is compelled by her experience to convey. The intensity builds as the story progresses, leading the audience to a dramatic and powerful close.To say any more would be to spoil the climax and conclusion of this movie, but I will say that what was most striking to me was the message conveyed through the film that &quot;the Kingdom of God is within you... not in mansions of wood and stone...&quot; signifying that God is not found in mere religious structure or traditions of men, but He is living and real and desires to indwell the hearts of people. Of course anyone familiar with their Bible knows that this message is boldly conveyed throughout the Scriptures and not merely in some lost pages of an ancient alleged Gospel, but the movie confronts the topic of faith head on and I feel does so brilliantly. The interesting twist of this picture is that God uses an atheist to proclaim His message; someone completely non-religious who is touched by religion in a very disturbing yet powerful and intimate way - in that she is identified with Christ through His sufferings.Probably not a whole lot of Christians will jump at the opportunity to buy this film, because of some of its disturbing scenes and language at points, not to mention the &quot;dark&quot; feel of the movie (which includes themes of demonic possession, crucifixion, etc.).  That is completely understandable and I certainly wouldn't classify this film as a &quot;Christian&quot; movie, but I would recommend it nonetheless because no matter your religious affiliation, the movie is powerful and the story is great and makes some strong points about religion versus relationship. There is also a short clip that portrays a very strong anti-abortion message, which was quite surprising as well.  The film-work, acting and even the music was decent. I gave it three stars because there are better movies out there and this one is on the &quot;dark side&quot; as far as movies go.  I would also classify it as not appropriate for children because of some bad language at times and disturbing, violent scenes. I saw it twice at the theater and enjoyed it both times.  I have both the DVD version (which is great because there is commentary through the movie by the director) and the VHS.",3,"Interesting Movie, Good Story, Good Message!",946339200,"12 28, 1999",1999,4521,"['movie', 'often', 'billed', 'category', 'quot', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'quot', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'opinion', 'difficult', 'define', 'entirely', 'label', 'suppose', 'moments', 'allude', 'descriptions', 'Stigmata', 'good', 'story', 'complete', 'intrigue', 'emotion', 'nice', 'special', 'effects', 'quite', 'surprisingly', 'hard', 'hitting', 'message', 'viewer', 'measurable', 'food', 'contemplation.The', 'story', '23-year-old', 'hairdresser', 'name', 'Frankie', 'Paige', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'atheist', 'just', 'ordinary', 'non-religious', 'person', 'ordinary', 'friends', 'Frankie', 'mother', 'gift', 'be', 'cross', 'deceased', 'stigmata', 'priest', 'Brazil', 'things', 'change', 'experience', 'phenomenon', 'stigmata', 'bleeding', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'did', 'cross', 'wounds', 'appearing', 'hands', 'feet', 'head', 'back', 'Frankie', 'stigmata', 'experience', 'also', 'accompanied', 'intense', 'visions', 'crucifixion', 'Christ', 'are', 'portrayed', 'more', 'violently', 'dramatically', 'then', 'had', 'seen', 'other', 'movie', 'depicted', 'crucifixion', 'Jesus', 'Frankie', 'disturbing', 'encounters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'go', 'doctors', 'psychologists', 'who', 'determine', 'must', 'either', 'be', 'suicidal', 'epileptic', 'chance', 'encounter', 'local', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Vatican', 'investigator', 'Andrew', 'Kiernan', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'document', 'episodes', 'Confronted', 'powerful', 'force', 'taken', 'control', 'Frankie', 'Kiernen', 'immediately', 'phenomenon', 'actual', 'miracle', 'God', 'become', 'messenger', 'God', 'reveal', 'lost', 'Gospel', 'supposed', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'Jesus', 'Himself', 'revelation', 'conspiracy', 'keep', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'not', 'Jesus', 'central', 'faith', 'Former', 'come', 'forward', 'validate', 'truth', 'so-called', 'Gospel', 'Jesus', 'Frankie', 'Andrew', 'develop', 'unique', 'friendship', 'film', 'eventually', 'are', 'met', 'individually', 'own', 'confrontation', 'question', 'faith', 'over', 'religion', 'as', 'well', 'deal', 'conspiracy', 'hand', 'officials', 'ranks', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'prepared', 'pursue', 'means', 'necessary', 'silence', 'messenger', 'Gospel', 'compelled', 'experience', 'convey', 'intensity', 'story', 'leading', 'audience', 'dramatic', 'powerful', 'close.To', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'spoil', 'climax', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'what', 'was', 'most', 'striking', 'was', 'message', 'conveyed', 'film', 'quot', 'Kingdom', 'God', 'not', 'mansions', 'wood', 'stone', 'quot', 'signifying', 'God', 'not', 'found', 'mere', 'religious', 'structure', 'traditions', 'men', 'living', 'real', 'indwell', 'hearts', 'people', 'course', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'Bible', 'knows', 'message', 'boldly', 'conveyed', 'Scriptures', 'not', 'merely', 'lost', 'pages', 'ancient', 'alleged', 'Gospel', 'movie', 'topic', 'faith', 'head', 'feel', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'interesting', 'twist', 'picture', 'God', 'atheist', 'proclaim', 'message', 'someone', 'completely', 'non-religious', 'who', 'touched', 'religion', 'very', 'disturbing', 'yet', 'powerful', 'intimate', 'way', 'identified', 'Christ', 'sufferings.Probably', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'Christians', 'will', 'jump', 'opportunity', 'buy', 'film', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'language', 'points', 'not', 'mention', 'quot', 'dark', 'quot', 'feel', 'movie', 'themes', 'demonic', 'possession', 'crucifixion', 'etc.', 'completely', 'understandable', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'classify', 'film', 'quot', 'Christian', 'quot', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'nonetheless', 'matter', 'religious', 'affiliation', 'movie', 'powerful', 'story', 'great', 'strong', 'points', 'religion', 'versus', 'relationship', 'also', 'short', 'clip', 'very', 'strong', 'anti-abortion', 'message', 'was', 'quite', 'surprising', 'as', 'well', 'film-work', 'acting', 'even', 'music', 'was', 'decent', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'are', 'better', 'movies', 'there', 'one', 'quot', 'dark', 'side', 'quot', 'as', 'far', 'movies', 'go', 'would', 'also', 'classify', 'not', 'appropriate', 'children', 'bad', 'language', 'times', 'disturbing', 'violent', 'scenes', 'saw', 'twice', 'theater', 'enjoyed', 'times', 'have', 'DVD', 'version', 'great', 'commentary', 'movie', 'director', 'VHS']",Stigmata VHS

Glasgow,"[0, 1]","When a film centers its plot as strongly around the practices of a particular religious sect as &quot;Stigmata&quot; does Catholicism, one can assume the film will be an attempt to comment on that sect, or at least  some aspect of that sect's traditions.&quot;Stigmata,&quot; though,  steps quickly out of the path of genuine, or even alarmist, commentary as  Arquette's &quot;Frankie&quot; becomes more and more deeply involved in the  weird spiritual legacy symbolized by the rosary of a dead South American  priest.This priest, whose position on the &quot;good guy-bad guy&quot;  scale is at best questionable throughout the film, has given his life to  the pursuit of the &quot;true&quot; historical Christ.  Does director  Wainwright admire or condemn him for this?  It's hard to tell--in the  theater version of the film, we see the late priest only as demon possessor  (the source, perhaps, of the &quot;Exorcist&quot; echoes); it's only in the  DVD's deleted prologue that we see the priest, tormented by his struggle  against the Catholic hierarchy, fling himself from his church steeple.  Perhaps this scene had been intended to win our sympathies for the poor  source of Frankie's suffering.  But even with the scene included, we still  are left to wonder just whose side God is on--or is Wainwright trying to  say that the church has killed God?  (And if so, why the optimistic  alternate ending?)As theologically vague and spiritually empty as the  film seems to be, though, it does qualify in my book as a high-quality  psychological thriller.

She uses her face  and gaze as a precision knife. Great body too. I suppose I am a fan.The  movie is about the mysterious in our life. Stigmata (the wounds of Christ  inflicted on very spiritual persons) must be one of the more colorful  elements of Christian mythology, and it is fascinating to see them realized  within the modern world. Our heroine, Frankie, gets the wounds even though  she is unreligious and quite earthly - but she is honest. How does an  honest person react to the sacred, to the otherworldly, to a mysterious and  overwhelming visit by God? Think of it. It is just a very interesting idea  and this movie makes it justice.There are two other themes in the story:  a scientist priest who falls out of love with the church and into love with  Frankie, and a (quite fictitious) gospel of Christ and the Vatican's  efforts to suppress it. There is also a demonic thread in the story which I  personally found off-key. All of these themes are joined into a well  crafted movie with intelligent use of color, music and Christian symbols  aplenty (streams of water, drops of blood, pigeons, fire).

It explains that the DVD  comes with an alternate ending, and to please watch the entire movie WITH  the alternate ending (as opposed to watching the alternate ending as a  seperate scene after viewing the theatrical version).

Litton,"[1, 1]","Upon watching Stigmata again, this time with the alternate ending on the DVD edition, I found that this version of the film is a much more emotional one, and definitely the better of the two. Also, some things were missed by  me in my first viewing of the film, things, I regret to say, make my first  review of the film obsolete. The scenes in which Frankie is being attacked  by the stigmata are full of religious overtones, especially the scene in  the subway where she is stretched out as if she were Jesus on the cross. I  also enjoy the scenes in Frankie's apartment, where her candles give the  room a sort of calm sense. The movie wonderfully portrays 90's culture and  its clash with the church. Performances given by Byrne and Arquette are  very believable and unique, especially for a very religious actress playing  a confirmed athiest.

I've always been curious to know what they think about demons, angels and demonic possessions and the way they are depicted in horror movies. At first, i thought that stupidity, non-sense  and heresy would be the main comments i would get in regards to horror but i was far from the truth. A few people indeed admitted that horror was nothing more than non-sense for them but a majority of them actually liked the genre and the movies for what it is. We had an interesting discussion about it and i was surprised to see that yes, some of those movies were indeed able to bring a little message of faith across  people who never really had a opinion on it, but mostly, those movies were also seen and praised for entertainment purposes, basically just to have a good time, like everybody else. STIGMATA was one of those movies, it was raw, scary, entertaining and at the same time carrying a very strong message of faith..Stigmata was not a big Hollywood production movie, i never consider it like that, it was simple and straight to the point. No big Hollywood stars, no crazy special effect, just a good story with punch. I would consider it as ""Religious Horror"", so as any movies involving demonic possessions and exorcisms.  It is the story of Frankie Paige, a young atheist who seemed to have received what is consider as ""Stigmata"", marks and sores corresponding to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ. Father Andrew Kiernan will help Frankie figure this out and find out why these things are happening to her. It appears Frankie might be holding the key to what would appear to be a gospel in the exact words of Jesus Christ (The Gospel of Thomas). Father Kiernan will have to get to the bottom of this, eluding a conspiracy to keep this gospel from coming out.Definitely recommend it to any religious horror fans. A good movie with a strong message! And remember, Jesus said... the Kingdom of God is inside you, and all around you, not in mansions of wood and stone.

Nothing like that had been done before and it caught many off guard. But it had a good script, good performances, a good subtext and William Friedkin at the the helm. So, of course, many chased it trying to achieve that level of expertise and success. This might have been closer than many, but, for my dollar, it still came up short.Here's the scoop. Patricia Arquette plays Frankie Paige. She's a beautician in Philly who begins to experience odd events including classic symptoms of stigmata. Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) works for the Vatican as an investigator or these sorts of phenomenon. He's put on the case and wants to dismiss it because Arquette is an atheist, and atheists don't experience stigmata. Odd things pile up and he begins to change his mind.I found this all to be overwrought. In ""The Exorcist"", as intense as things got, it all hung together and effected the viewer at a deep level. Part of that might have been the late 60s, 'the world is changing', subtext. But it had great gravity. Here I got the impression the director, Rupert Wainright, was just trying too hard. He really went after it and that might be the problem. Everything was just too. And Patricia Arquette, even though she'd been in the biz for awhile didn't work for me. With the exception of a couple of scenes, I don't feel as though she found the right notes. I like Gabriel Byrne and he doesn't disappoint here. Jonathan Pryce, as Cardinal Houseman, was also good. He exemplified the self righteous and corrupt posture of the Vatican in its wanting to squash anything that might chip away at its position of power.This isn't a bad watch by any means.

Arquette in  particular continues a career of great performances; this lady can act!  But, as I reached the conclusion, I couldn't help but wonder if the  screenwriters got confused on which direction they were headed.  At some  points, Arquette's character is clearly antagonistic toward priests and  nuns--ala &quot;The Exorcist&quot; in a few scenes--but later we're told  she's the messenger for Jesus's words as revealed through the departed  spirit of a Brazilian Catholic priest.

It is more like a modern melodrama with a heavy dose of religious subject matter, nice performances and some nice editing but unfortunately  not much more. The subject matter is sure to stir up some controversy but  that could easily be done be reading the basic ideas in a book, a film is  made to entertain and deliver something whether it's tears, laughs or  scares. While not a very bad film, 'Stigmata' just doesn't score in any  cinematic genre, it tries to swing violently between them but never scores.  Patricia Arquette, as always, fails to make an impression but gets the job  done well enough. Gabriel Byrne gives the best performance in the cast and  decided to play it mellow, which is a good thing and we never get weary of  his character. The main problem here is that explores subjects it couldn't  possibly tackle. Basically, it stirs up some intriguing and controversial  ideas but leaves you wanting. And also the filmmakers added some blood and  violence near the end so the audience would get their moneys worth but  ended up bringing the film down. It also has a heavy dose of 'The Exorcist'  on the 'scary scenes'. And also the ending is dull and unsatisfying. It  ultimately feels like a half-baked idea made into a movie.

474193,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305718903,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 1]","SPOILER WARNING:  This comment contains specific references to plot elements that reveal the ending.  It is strongly recommended that you see the film before reading this review.`Stigmata' uses as its premise the  actual existence of the gospel of Thomas, a gospel taken from a scroll  found in 1945, and condemned by the Catholic Church as heresy.  This gospel  gives essentially the same message as the gospel in the film, that the  kingdom of God is of this earth and it is not about heaven, churches or  religion.  But clearly, the gospel in the film is not Thomas, despite the  allusion at the end of the film.  Thomas was written in Greek not Aramaic,  and has been dated by scholars to the second century, hardly  contemporaneous with Jesus.  The film is a highly contrived fictional yarn  that imaginatively invents a scroll of Jesus' words and then takes the  religious mythos of stigmata and combines it with the mythos of possession  (in ways not consistent with either) as a device to reveal the plot of the  Church to keep the gospel a secret.We are asked to believe that an  atheist gets stigmata (no such event has ever been reported) as the result  of possession by the spirit of a dead human whom she never knew (this is  the purview of the devil; human spirits are not thought to possess living  beings) because she touched his rosary beads (also touched by her mother,  the boy who sold them to her and Father Kiernan without effect).  Ok, I  guess that's what fantasy films are supposed to do, conjure improbable  situations out of the imagination.  Still, it takes liberties that distort  and misrepresent religious beliefs, which is always risky business.  While  watching this film, I had to pretend I didn't know what I know.  Once over  this hurdle, it was an fascinating, engaging and frightening story.There  are other strange inconsistencies and unanswered questions though.  Father  Alameida was a good and pious man.  Yet he possesses Frankie with an evil  vengeance and attempts to use Frankie to sexually seduce Kiernan, beating  him from pillar to post when he doesn't consent.  That's just not  consistent with who Alameida was.  Also, why was Frankie strong enough to  throw Kiernan around the room like a rag doll, but helpless to stop  Cardinal Houseman from choking her?  And what was all the dripping water  about?  If that was explained somewhere, I must have missed it.Comparisons between this and `The Exorcist' are misplaced.  They really  had nothing in common other than the fact that the main character was  possessed.  There is one scene during the rage following Frankie's  seduction attempt of Kiernan that had obvious elements of comparison but  that was about it.  This was not an exorcism and the devil was nowhere to  be found.From a filmmaking standpoint, this film was terrific.  Rupert  Wainwright does a marvelous job from start to finish with this film.  The  photography was fantastic.  The use of the camera perspectives, scene set  up and various techniques including slow motion, double exposures, rapid  fire jump cuts and reverse slow motion were all fabulous (though sometimes  used to excess) and added power and impact to create some very scary  footage.  I've read complaints about the sound, but the sound on the DVD  copy I had was great with excellent surround effects.  It was a bit loud at  times but not so much that I had to ride shotgun on the volume  control.This was a marvelous breakthrough performance for Patricia  Arquette.  When she was in Frankie mode she was sometimes arrogant and self  centered, and at others sweet, helpless and terrified.  When in possession  mode she was powerful and frightening.  She handled all these states  believably and with aplomb.Gabriel Byrne also gave a wonderful  performance as Father Kiernan.

Yet, the producers brazenly add a concluding unscientific postscript about the gospel of Thomas discovered in 1945.  This movie overdid the trashed apartment theme a la Blake Edwards of Pink Panther lore.  The male voice coming from the woman probably sealed the priest's vow to remain celabite.  The supernatural power in the woman that trashed the New York subway train was apparently careless of the safety of the people on the subway, as well as reckless in disregard of the insurance claims.  The priests in this movie must have been modeled on the Anti Defamation League in their consummate fanaticism.  The one priest was fanatical, the other a borderline libertine.  Ironically, both appeal to the spirit of Hollywood and serve its purposes in giving credance to gnosticism by discrediting symbols of Christiandom.  However, in its ad hominem attacks, gnostic Hollywood stays free and clear from addressing any factual questions, such as the actual dating of the socalled gospel of Thomas.  If the ""kingdom of God lies within you,"" then why are people so selfish, greedy and rotten?  Gnostic Hollywood cannot answer this question.  What is brainwashing?  Who has that as their priority?  Brainwashing creates the appearance of appealing to the intellect while all the long censoring the person from contravening facts and arguments.  We don't hear both sides of the story in this film.  All we get is the classic informal fallacies of appeal to emotion and ad hominem attacks.  I hope the viewing public has enough self respect to pick up work written by Christian scholars who, unlike Hollywood, actually give you facts and information.I recommend reading John A. T. Robinson's book ""Redating the New Testament,"" or F. F. Bruce's book ""The New Testament Documents: Are they Reliable,"" or Geisler and Nix's book ""Guide to the Bible.""

Gilbert""","[5, 5]","...but don't be put off by the reviews of others who seem to have an axe to grind against this movie.The synopsis is simple enough.  Frankie (Patricia Arquette), a 'trendy, hip' hairstylist suddenly receives the stigmata (apparently transferred to her from a rosery who used to belong to an excommunicated priest), and Father Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) is sent from Rome to investigate.  Their relationship changes throughout the movie from simple aquaintence to falling slightly in love, to frustration and anger, to a relationship that may be best described as father/daughter; all while Father Kiernan is trying to solve the perplexing mystery as to why she has received the stigmata.  Eventually Father Kiernana figures out that he's being used as a pawn to silence the supernatural in an attempt to make the ""church"" rule supreme over personal faith - a faith described by the Gospel of St. Thomas.  The movie closes by mentioning in passing what the Gospel of Thomas allegedly is, and pointing out the fact that the Catholic Church has rejected it.I have heard people complain that this is too much of just a montoge of scattered images, but i don't think that that's a fair criticism.  The movie does have more of a photographic feel to it, in that it reads like groupings of photographs about particular moments in the character's lives over a period of time - as opposed to a completely smooth, seamless film.  If more segmented filming isn't your thing, you probably won't like the way the filming of this movie is handled - don't buy it.In my opinion, the imagery in the movie is quite breathtaking and very visually interesting.  Both main characters, Frankie and Father Keirnan, play opposite to the dramatic scenery; that is they're both really rather matter-of-fact down to earth; something other people have reviewed as 'boring.'  Watch for yourself and see if you like the mixture.A couple words about the DVD.  First, as many people have mentioned, the DVD does come with an alternate ending, and I agree with DJD - watch it with the director's ending, which is much more powerful, and just makes more sense.  Second, I should mention the one thing that I don't like about the DVD's extras: you have no choice but to watch all of the deleted scenes if you want to see any of them.  It's not a big deal, but it'd be nice to see all the choices instead of having to watch them all to see them all.On a final note, I have to say that although I really enjoyed the movie (my wife and I just bought it because we both liked it so much), it does have a theological bent that I disagree with.  Although I'm not Catholic (I graduated from a Protestant Seminary), I do agree with the Catholic church in deciding to not cannonize the Gospel of St. Thomas.  I agree that faith is personal and is not regulated by the Church, but the gospel of Thomas consists of more than ""The Kingdom of God is within you..."" etc. etc., (the section that was continually quoted in the movie).  By the time you get to the end of The Gospel of St. Thomas, you find that Jesus is saying all sorts of things that are out of line with the cannonized gospels, and that he's a male chauvinist; far from the Jesus who took time to love and care even for a woman caught in adultry (John 8:3-11).  So, it's a good film about the tensions behind the scenes in religious communities, but this movie certainly does have a bias about a truly questionable document.Enjoy the movie!",5,This movie is apparently not for everyone...,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,3454,"['do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'reviews', 'others', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'axe', 'grind', 'movie.The', 'synopsis', 'simple', 'enough', 'Frankie', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', ""'trendy"", 'hip', 'hairstylist', 'suddenly', 'stigmata', 'apparently', 'transferred', 'rosery', 'who', 'used', 'belong', 'excommunicated', 'priest', 'Father', 'Kiernan', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'sent', 'Rome', 'investigate', 'relationship', 'changes', 'movie', 'simple', 'aquaintence', 'falling', 'slightly', 'love', 'frustration', 'anger', 'relationship', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'described', 'father/daughter', 'Father', 'Kiernan', 'trying', 'solve', 'perplexing', 'mystery', 'why', 'received', 'stigmata', 'Eventually', 'Father', 'Kiernana', 'out', 'being', 'used', 'pawn', 'silence', 'supernatural', 'attempt', 'make', 'church', 'rule', 'supreme', 'personal', 'faith', 'faith', 'described', 'Gospel', 'St.', 'Thomas', 'movie', 'closes', 'mentioning', 'passing', 'what', 'Gospel', 'Thomas', 'allegedly', 'pointing', 'out', 'fact', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'rejected', 'it.I', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'montoge', 'scattered', 'images', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fair', 'criticism', 'movie', 'have', 'more', 'photographic', 'feel', 'groupings', 'photographs', 'particular', 'moments', 'character', 'lives', 'period', 'time', 'opposed', 'completely', 'smooth', 'seamless', 'film', 'more', 'segmented', 'filming', ""n't"", 'thing', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'filming', 'movie', 'handled', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'it.In', 'opinion', 'imagery', 'movie', 'quite', 'breathtaking', 'very', 'visually', 'interesting', 'main', 'characters', 'Frankie', 'Father', 'Keirnan', 'play', 'opposite', 'dramatic', 'scenery', ""'re"", 'really', 'rather', 'matter-of-fact', 'earth', 'something', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'reviewed', ""'boring"", 'Watch', 'see', 'like', 'mixture.A', 'couple', 'words', 'DVD', 'First', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'come', 'alternate', 'ending', 'agree', 'DJD', 'watch', 'director', 'ending', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'just', 'more', 'sense', 'Second', 'should', 'mention', 'one', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'DVD', 'extras', 'have', 'choice', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'want', 'see', 'not', 'big', 'deal', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'choices', 'instead', 'having', 'watch', 'see', 'all.On', 'final', 'note', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'wife', 'just', 'bought', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'theological', 'bent', 'disagree', ""'m"", 'not', 'Catholic', 'graduated', 'Protestant', 'Seminary', 'do', 'agree', 'Catholic', 'church', 'deciding', 'not', 'cannonize', 'Gospel', 'St.', 'Thomas', 'agree', 'faith', 'personal', 'not', 'regulated', 'Church', 'gospel', 'Thomas', 'more', 'Kingdom', 'God', 'etc', 'etc.', 'section', 'was', 'continually', 'quoted', 'movie', 'time', 'get', 'end', 'Gospel', 'St.', 'Thomas', 'find', 'Jesus', 'saying', 'sorts', 'things', 'are', 'line', 'cannonized', 'gospels', 'male', 'chauvinist', 'far', 'Jesus', 'who', 'took', 'time', 'love', 'care', 'even', 'woman', 'caught', 'adultry', 'John', '8:3-11', 'So', 'good', 'film', 'tensions', 'scenes', 'religious', 'communities', 'movie', 'certainly', 'have', 'bias', 'truly', 'questionable', 'document.Enjoy', 'movie']",Stigmata VHS

Lincoln ""The Truth is Absolutely No...","[0, 0]","Stigmata will challenge your indoctrinated thought-cells, or make you reflect upon the fact that only a few decades ago, this movie could not have been made. To perpetuate the Repression of Free-Thought and the Power of Dogmatic teachings, the church has controlled everything from education (modern history included) to personal sexuality...and communion with God. This film reveals some of the Inversive teachings and disinformation the church has used to stay in power. Obviously, everyone knows the Extremes the church has gone to, in order to perpetuate false teachings, such as the Earth being the center of the Solar System and all the other things men and women were forced to recant, because some guy in a big hat had an Ego problem the size of the Great Pyramid.... However, how many people know just how far the church has gone, down the path of insanity, to prevent anyone from becoming a Free-Thinker? After-all, they created the Inquisition--which has been proven to be a rampage of murderous carnage--inspired by madness, ignorance and power-tripping, egomaniacal nonsense. This movie awakens us to some of the truth....but, how much more is Hidden within the vaults of the vatican...denied to Intelligent eyes that are not a part of the system?  I have read a few Papal Bulls....sounds like insanity, to me...but, at-least they are appropriately named. No wonder the Freemasons were persecuted so much, throughout time, and continue to be persecuted today. The funny thing is, if the church would just release the truth, they could regain their dignity and be a source of inspiration to mankind, instead of wallowing in pompous lies and blaming everyone-else for their inner demons. This movie is the closest thing I have seen to a revelation of the inner hierarchical ridiculousness of the former most-powerful organization on Earth (which is Flat! God says so!), so buy a copy and watch it with your friends. The film is very-much designed for &quot;Gen-X&quot; and has the feel of a Music Video, during various segments.

474198,A9YTARTKZRXL,6305718903,"""greysky""","[7, 7]","Stigmata is by far one of the best movies I've seen- it is really incredible in comparison with other movies that try to achieve its success.This movie is strange, and sometimes even slightly sinister in  its portrayal of a woman named Frankie Paige in New York (Patricia  Arquette) who is afflicted with the Stigmata, or the wounds of Christ. An  open minded priest (Gabriel Byrne) ends up meeting with her, and is  extremely surprised to find that this claim of Stigmata occurences is true,  despite the fact that Frankie doesn't go to church. In fact, Frankie isn't  very religious at all, and lives the shallow, hip life of a partying  hairstylist. The contrast between the Church and the life of this young  woman is brilliant and stunningly effective.The rest of the movie is  spent discovering more about the situation that Frankie is in, and the  possible implications it could have to the church, and to the religion  itself. In the end this movie is a deeply thought provoking exploration of  religion itself, how everything that is accepted by the church may not be  the truth, and how what many of us follow could be completely backwards. It  really makes you think.This already strong movie is further enhanced  with the visual effects- so much so that you could buy this movie just for  the incredible scenes. All of the wounds of Christ shown in the film are  very realistically, enough so that many squeamish people may have to turn  away from the screen during these moments. The the way the wounds are shown  to occur (chaotically, and in sudden flashses) is incredible, adding to the  suspense. Also, in the climax of the film there is one particularly  rewarding scene which you might just have to watch over and over (it's too  cool!)This movie is definitely and incredible achievment in filmaking,  with a great and intellectual plot expressed with beauty. Some people may  not like it as much if they are sensitive to graphic scenes, or if they  don't like content that has to do with religion.

I watched this film with a bunch of friends and I don't think they enjoyed it very much. But I really liked this film. I think if you look closer into the movie, just try to enjoy it and see its message then I'm sure you will be able to appreciate the film a lot more. Stigmata is surprisingly very intelligent. It explains with excellent cleverness exactly what is happening to the main character. The film also searches into the depths of religions and pulls out things we never knew about and some great philosophies about God. The movie is also visually stunning. We get slow motion, blood and water drips splashing spookily, statues crying and brilliant makeup and special effects. When you see what is happening to Frankie as a retread of what happened to God while he was on the cross, you feel like you can actually hear the whip lashing, or feeling the nails going into your wrists. So, the movie is smart, intriguing, looks great and has an interesting moral. What more do you want? Perhaps the movie could've cut the romance story, which really peeved me off, and there were a couple of boring parts. The end sort of leaves on an unexciting note. However, the big picture is a movie that has a great meaning and terrified me with its scenes of intense violence. This movie is not for the faint-hearted and hard-out Christians, but I recommend Patricia Arquette fans, thriller and supernatural movie fans and people who enjoy good visuals and eerie settings to watch Stigmata.NOTE: I loved the production notes and alernate ending to the movie on the DVD, but felt they could've had something that journied a little further into the genius of the excellent visuals.

The allure of sex and a sadomasochistic slant heighten the viewer's interest certainly to a voyeuristic level of curiosity but the film never delivers or explores what it seems to imply. Gabriel Byrne looks as confused as the rest of us. Padre Pio, who is mentioned in the film, was a real priest who had bore the stigmata for over fifty years. This is well documented but I truly believe it had little to do with Vatican politics. His stigmata was a sign of devotion and sacrifice.

This film is one more stone along that road. It is an incredible story, meaning a story that cannot be believed, just as if when dealing with the Christian god there were no limits whatsoever as for the lack of any logic or reason. The haunting of a non believer by an Aramaic document that she has never seen, what's more understood, to the point of getting the victim of the reproduction  in her flesh of Jesus' stigmata and her writing on a wall the full text of the document still in Aramaic is unbelievable. A human being can only be haunted by something that has had a concrete connection or contact with that person. It is not the beads of a dead priest from Brazil, stolen by some non identified local person, bought by the mother of the victim in the village, who at least visited the place where that dead priest used to preach, and received via mail by the victim from her mother, that can justify that haunting of that person. Then the contradictory discourse of a priest who is originally a scientist and who turns a believer in empathy more than reason for the girl justifies in his blindness the extreme defensive attitude of the hierarchy of the church that prefers killing the evidence to accepting the disturbing truth, if truth it is.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",4,Time wasted in anti-catholic bigotry,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,1627,"['amazing', 'see', 'amount', 'time', 'energy', 'mental', 'fuel', 'vain', 'consumed', 'build', 'rebuild', 'plot', 'theory', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'hijacked', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'gospel', 'love', 'gospel', 'domination', 'control', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'stone', 'road', 'incredible', 'story', 'meaning', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'believed', 'just', 'when', 'dealing', 'Christian', 'god', 'were', 'limits', 'whatsoever', 'lack', 'logic', 'reason', 'haunting', 'non', 'believer', 'Aramaic', 'document', 'never', 'seen', 'what', 'more', 'understood', 'point', 'getting', 'victim', 'reproduction', 'flesh', 'Jesus', 'stigmata', 'writing', 'wall', 'full', 'text', 'document', 'still', 'Aramaic', 'unbelievable', 'human', 'being', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'haunted', 'something', 'had', 'concrete', 'connection', 'contact', 'person', 'not', 'beads', 'dead', 'priest', 'Brazil', 'stolen', 'non', 'identified', 'local', 'person', 'bought', 'mother', 'victim', 'village', 'who', 'least', 'visited', 'place', 'where', 'dead', 'priest', 'used', 'preach', 'received', 'mail', 'victim', 'mother', 'can', 'justify', 'haunting', 'person', 'Then', 'contradictory', 'discourse', 'priest', 'who', 'originally', 'scientist', 'who', 'believer', 'empathy', 'more', 'reason', 'girl', 'justifies', 'blindness', 'extreme', 'defensive', 'attitude', 'hierarchy', 'church', 'prefers', 'killing', 'evidence', 'accepting', 'disturbing', 'truth', 'truth', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",Stigmata VHS

In fact, they did it so blatently hard that Stigmata did horrible in the box office.  Many people go by what the critics say and Stigmata is living proof that you shouldn't, this is a very entertaining film so don't listen to everyone. And as you can see, the Amazon readers ""for the most part"" seem to enjoy the movie more than the big guys do. I've heard comments that ""people enjoyed the movie when it came to DVD moreso than they did when they watched it on the big screen. Why is this? I'm not really sure. Maybe it seems more like a made for ""TV Movie"" but I don't feel that is the case. It doesn't seem to be a ""cheaply"" made movie by any means and the actors are known. Nonetheless...It's no Exoricst or Gone with The Wind, but Stigmata is fun and anyone that enjoys a tale about religion/horror movie in general, should give it a chance. Gabriel Burne (Father Andrew Kiernan) plays the role of the slash scientist/priest quite well. I always thought he was a wonderful actor. He also played Satan in End of Days and played a big role in ""Point of No Return"" with Bridgette Fonda. His wonderful acting skills are very well done. This great popcorn movie puts a stab into religion in general and some might be offended, but remember, it's just a movie!!! Once again, the Catholics are attacked, but it's all believeable and fun at the same time. Patrica Arquette does a substantial job as her role as a self admitting atheist who gets inflicted with the Stygmata. A simple hairdresser brought into the madness.She kind of looks bored through some her scenes and she needs to show a little more emotion and spunk in my opinion, but ""Gabriel"" saves most of the scenes when they are both together. The movie takes a lot of it's general ideas from the Exorcist, same idea, just a different time and infliction only now with a twist.  I felt the movie is very suspenseful, clever, dramatic and the acting is very well done. This movie won't bring you any closer to God, that's not what it's trying to do, it's just trying to do something different and fun, and I think Stigmata succeeds! Buy it now if you haven't seen it.

I had forgotten that the film was based upon the Gospel according to St. Thomas, a gospel that is not recognized by the Roman Catholic Church and is not included in the New Testament. The Gospel according to Thomas is not about the life of Jesus. Rather, it is about the things that Jesus said. There are one hundred and fourteen such sayings that have been translated. One of those sayings is at the heart of this film. ""Split a piece of wood, and I am there. Lift up a stone and you will find me.""The film is about an investigative Jesuit  priest, a young atheist who suffers from the stigmata, and a conspiracy within the Roman Catholic Church to suppress a certain gospel, as if fears its destruction should that gospel become public. The investigative priest, Father Andrew Kiernan, is played with appropriate gravity by Gabriel Byrne, a serious man with a faith issue, as he is not just a man of the cloth, he is also a scientist with a degree in chemistry. He travels around the world investigating alleged miracles. The young atheist suffering from Stigmata is Frankie, a twenty-three year old hairdresser played with great sincerity by a young and nubile Patricia Arquette. Cardinal Houseman, the politically savvy church official seeking to suppress the perfidy of the Church, is played with zealous determination by Jonathan Pryce.I loved everything about this film. While there are elements of horror intertwined with its underlying intellectual theme, these two odd bedfellows merely make the film more interesting. I certainly did not find the juxtaposition of these two elements incompatible. The special effects do not overwhelm the film, but, instead, serve to enhance the experience of the viewer in understanding the film's themes and message. The film also boasts a wonderful soundtrack that meshes perfectly with the film and adds to its drama. Moreover, the film boasts stellar performances by its entire cast.This is a very entertaining film that is well worth having in one's personal film collection.

474235,A19WRXQ7EG8QF5,6305718903,"L. Carol ""carolcecilia, D.V.""","[2, 3]","When I first saw the movie in 2000, I was deeply moved by the central theme propounded by the Gospel according to Thomas, best paraphrased in the screenplay as: ""The Kingdom of God is within you and all around you, not in buildings of wood and stone. Split a piece of wood and I am there, lift a stone and you will find me"".The special effects in the scenes where stigmata was inflicted upon Patricia Arquette, the protagonist personifying modern-day St. Francis di Assisi, were also visually striking and left a vivid imprint on my mind. The screenplay was also neat in its linkage of stigmata* with the uncorrelated Thomas Gospel and made an engaging tale of it. While the movie may come across to some as contrived, church-bashing, irreverent and blasphemous, it was artfully filmed and conveyed the meritorious theme that it is more important to look upon Jesus' teachings and how much God loves us all, not didactic doctrines which may veer towards downright propaganda supporting the ongoing financial needs surrounding much of organised religion.However, being more exposed to biblical and extra-biblical research on the subject matter now, I would like to share with viewers that the central premise of the movie may well be flawed. John P. Meier, in his 'A Marginal Jew', the volume of three books touted by scholars as one of the foremost studies ever written on the historical Jesus, advanced the theory that ""the Gospel of Thomas did depend, directly or indirectly, on some if not all of the canonical Gospels (of Luke, Mark, Matthew and John)"", thereby trashing the belief that it was independently written, not least being the definitive source recording of the sayings of Jesus written without any narrative structure. This is not to say that there is no redeeming grace to the oft-quoted theme in the movie because, speaking in one voice with many secular scholars and unconventional Christian thinkers, I too desire to take hold of the message that the Kingdom of God is here and now. For viewers who are interested in gaining a perspective and the controversial anomalies of the gospel, I highly recommend ""The Gospel of Thomas"" by Professor Stevan Davies. This book is written by one of the foremost scholars in Thomasine who, for over three decades, studied the text of the ancient book found inside a sealed jar in a small desert cave at the base of an Egyptian cliff near Nag Hammadi in 1945.*For a detailed and well-research account on the mystery of sacred stigmata, check out Michael Freze's ""They Bore the Wounds of Christ"", a book where the screenwriters of Stigmata the movie probably drew myriad ideas from. The author's work was meticulous as he covered the A-Z of sacred stigmata, from the pre-requisites/qualifications to the pain/suffering to the physical manifestation to every nitty-gritty that pertained to what defined stigmatists/stigmatics, in a tightly written 300+ page-turner. The author, a Roman Catholic of the Franciscan Order (followers of St. Francis di Assisi), wrote with great devotion of his faith in God's work through the saints being called to this particular act of trial and tribulation. His depth of knowledge of the Bible as well as the documents produced by the Vatican were well punctuated throughout the book to afford readers independent cross-referencing. Personally, I find the discussion on 'The Holy Shroud of Turin' (the ancient cloth alleged to be the burial shroud of Jesus; the chronology / biography of stigmatists; and the appendix on interviews with priests who served or personally knew modern-day stigmatics thought-provoking. For those who are squeamish, ceveat emptor: pictures of modern-day stigmatists depicted in the book are not for the faint-hearted. While I refrain from drawing any conclusions on the author's interpretation of the phenomenon (to largely afflict laypersons/women/Italian by origin) based on purely anecdotal evidence, the book's greatest merit was the author's fervent desire to be right with God. Whether readers find sacred stigamta authentic or not, this devotional material presented a timely wake-up call and faith renewal to self-professed God-believers, not least a satiating supplement to our quest for intellectual stimulation.",3,"Visually Gratifying, Atmospheric Movie",1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,4237,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', '2000', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'central', 'theme', 'propounded', 'Gospel', 'according', 'Thomas', 'best', 'paraphrased', 'screenplay', 'Kingdom', 'God', 'not', 'buildings', 'wood', 'stone', 'Split', 'piece', 'wood', 'am', 'there', 'lift', 'stone', 'will', 'find', 'special', 'effects', 'scenes', 'where', 'stigmata', 'was', 'inflicted', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'protagonist', 'personifying', 'modern-day', 'St.', 'Francis', 'di', 'Assisi', 'were', 'also', 'visually', 'striking', 'left', 'vivid', 'imprint', 'mind', 'screenplay', 'was', 'also', 'neat', 'linkage', 'stigmata*', 'uncorrelated', 'Thomas', 'Gospel', 'made', 'engaging', 'tale', 'movie', 'may', 'come', 'contrived', 'church-bashing', 'irreverent', 'blasphemous', 'was', 'artfully', 'filmed', 'conveyed', 'meritorious', 'theme', 'more', 'important', 'look', 'Jesus', 'teachings', 'how', 'much', 'God', 'not', 'didactic', 'doctrines', 'may', 'veer', 'towards', 'downright', 'propaganda', 'supporting', 'ongoing', 'financial', 'surrounding', 'much', 'organised', 'religion.However', 'being', 'more', 'exposed', 'biblical', 'extra-biblical', 'research', 'subject', 'matter', 'now', 'would', 'like', 'share', 'viewers', 'central', 'premise', 'movie', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'flawed', 'John', 'P.', 'Meier', 'A', 'Marginal', 'Jew', 'volume', 'three', 'books', 'touted', 'scholars', 'one', 'foremost', 'studies', 'ever', 'written', 'historical', 'Jesus', 'advanced', 'theory', 'Gospel', 'Thomas', 'did', 'depend', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'not', 'canonical', 'Gospels', 'Luke', 'Mark', 'Matthew', 'John', 'thereby', 'trashing', 'belief', 'was', 'independently', 'written', 'not', 'least', 'being', 'definitive', 'source', 'recording', 'sayings', 'Jesus', 'written', 'narrative', 'structure', 'not', 'say', 'redeeming', 'grace', 'oft-quoted', 'theme', 'movie', 'speaking', 'one', 'voice', 'many', 'secular', 'scholars', 'unconventional', 'Christian', 'thinkers', 'too', 'desire', 'take', 'hold', 'message', 'Kingdom', 'God', 'here', 'now', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'gaining', 'perspective', 'controversial', 'anomalies', 'gospel', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Gospel', 'Thomas', 'Professor', 'Stevan', 'Davies', 'book', 'written', 'one', 'foremost', 'scholars', 'Thomasine', 'who', 'three', 'decades', 'studied', 'text', 'ancient', 'book', 'found', 'sealed', 'jar', 'small', 'desert', 'cave', 'base', 'Egyptian', 'cliff', 'Nag', 'Hammadi', '1945', '*For', 'detailed', 'well-research', 'account', 'mystery', 'sacred', 'stigmata', 'check', 'out', 'Michael', 'Freze', 'Bore', 'Wounds', 'Christ', 'book', 'where', 'screenwriters', 'Stigmata', 'movie', 'probably', 'drew', 'myriad', 'ideas', 'author', 'work', 'was', 'meticulous', 'covered', 'A-Z', 'sacred', 'stigmata', 'pre-requisites/qualifications', 'pain/suffering', 'physical', 'manifestation', 'nitty-gritty', 'pertained', 'what', 'defined', 'stigmatists/stigmatics', 'tightly', 'written', '300+', 'page-turner', 'author', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Franciscan', 'Order', 'followers', 'St.', 'Francis', 'di', 'Assisi', 'wrote', 'great', 'devotion', 'faith', 'God', 'work', 'saints', 'being', 'called', 'particular', 'act', 'trial', 'tribulation', 'depth', 'knowledge', 'Bible', 'as', 'well', 'documents', 'produced', 'Vatican', 'were', 'well', 'punctuated', 'book', 'afford', 'readers', 'independent', 'cross-referencing', 'Personally', 'find', 'discussion', ""'The"", 'Holy', 'Shroud', 'Turin', 'ancient', 'cloth', 'alleged', 'be', 'burial', 'shroud', 'Jesus', 'chronology', '/', 'biography', 'stigmatists', 'appendix', 'interviews', 'priests', 'who', 'served', 'personally', 'knew', 'modern-day', 'stigmatics', 'thought-provoking', 'who', 'are', 'squeamish', 'ceveat', 'emptor', 'pictures', 'modern-day', 'stigmatists', 'depicted', 'book', 'are', 'not', 'faint-hearted', 'refrain', 'drawing', 'conclusions', 'author', 'interpretation', 'phenomenon', 'largely', 'afflict', 'laypersons/women/Italian', 'origin', 'based', 'purely', 'anecdotal', 'evidence', 'book', 'greatest', 'merit', 'was', 'author', 'fervent', 'desire', 'be', 'right', 'God', 'Whether', 'readers', 'find', 'sacred', 'stigamta', 'authentic', 'not', 'devotional', 'material', 'presented', 'timely', 'wake-up', 'call', 'faith', 'renewal', 'self-professed', 'God-believers', 'not', 'least', 'satiating', 'supplement', 'quest', 'intellectual', 'stimulation']",Stigmata VHS

Is it a scathing commentary against the Catholic Church?  I really couldn't tell.  While the story is flimsily entertaining, and the effects creative and almost overwhelming, the film and its message can barely hold itself together.  The acting is sufficient, so I have to blame the screenplay.The basic premise is: a young woman - - who happens to be an atheist - - is stricken with stigmata (a condition where the wounds of Christ's crucifixion appear on a body) after receiving a religious item from a priest who has recently died.  The handsome, hip, priest who is assigned to investigate her case is then caught in the midst of Vatican politics fueled by Church self-preservationists.  The woman, meanwhile, goes through a very ""Exorcist""-like transformation.  There are some very dumbed-down plot points that you have to just swallow in order to stay with the story.  Does anyone today really not have any idea what a rosary is?  Especially anyone who lived through the late '80s - - and is familiar with Madonna, Cher, or any other of the myriad of celebrities who have rosaries tattoed to their bodies?  Does a priest, particularly a priest who is stationed out of the Vatican itself, really need to be explained about the variety of Gospels, where they came from, and why they vary?  Would a hospital really release a patient whom they believed just jammed a pointed object cleanly through both wrists?  Wouldn't they put you on suicide watch or something?  Especially after you keep coming back with other mysterious wounds and no logical explanation for them?  And the biggest farce of them all - - how does a hairdresser get medical insurance where her doctor immediately wants to implant neuro-sensors into her head to investigate the cause of her seizure-like problem?  I have a government job and I have to get an ungodly number of authorizations and referrals just to have a mole removed!The best part of this movie is seeing Enrico Colantino, the guy who played Elliot the photographer from the tv series 'Just Shoot Me', in character as a Vatican toady with a thick Italian accent.The problem with 'Stigmata' is most of the characters are utterly under-developed, as is the primary plot line, and the focus is placed on the special effects, including some not-so-dazzling attempts at utilizing symbolism.

Frankie Paige played by Patricia Arquette is a hair stylist who has no strong religious convictions until odd things start happening to her after she's given a rosary by her mother: she begins speaking with another person's voice; unknown and unseen forces start to attack her; and she develops stigmata. Some people believe that a holy miracle has been visited on Frankie, though no one can say why. A Cardinal from the Vatican played by Jonathan Pryce sends a priest, Father Andrew Kiernan enjoyably portrayed by Gabriel Byrne, to investigate Frankie and her condition; after getting a first-hand look, Father Andrew finds himself less concerned with whether Frankie's wounds are a legitimate miracle and more concerned with saving her life.",4,Title says it all.,974592000,"11 19, 2000",2000,911,"['movie', 'well', 'shot', 'Plenty', 'foreshadowing', 'helps', 'make', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'watch', 'Stigmata', 'supernatural', 'suspense', 'story', 'good', 'evil', 'faith', 'Frankie', 'Paige', 'played', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'hair', 'stylist', 'who', 'strong', 'religious', 'convictions', 'odd', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'given', 'rosary', 'mother', 'speaking', 'person', 'voice', 'unknown', 'unseen', 'forces', 'start', 'attack', 'stigmata', 'people', 'believe', 'holy', 'miracle', 'been', 'visited', 'Frankie', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'why', 'Cardinal', 'Vatican', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'priest', 'Father', 'Andrew', 'Kiernan', 'enjoyably', 'portrayed', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'investigate', 'Frankie', 'condition', 'getting', 'first-hand', 'look', 'Father', 'Andrew', 'less', 'concerned', 'Frankie', 'wounds', 'are', 'legitimate', 'miracle', 'more', 'concerned', 'saving', 'life']",Stigmata VHS

To call it a monumental disappointment is an understatement.First of all it was promoted as an ""Exorcist"" styled psychological chiller.  Naturally I was psyched to see it based on that but in truth ""Stigmata"" is nothing like the ""Exorcist"" in story, style, or quality.  After seeing it it was obvious that this comparison was merely a shameless promotional scheme meant to deliberately deceive the viewer.Furthermore, and not the least of its problems, was the casting. Gabriel Byrne was fantastic, as usual, even with the dull material he had to work with.  I swear the guy must be an alchemist but instead of turning lead into gold he achieves the same result with garbage.  Patricia Arquette on the other hand could suck the life out of an Ed Wood production.  She's the only actress I can think of that's guilty of underacting and here she is with top billing!  All the while they had Portia de Rossi in the cast who's an extraordinary and capable actress, despide credits the likes of Ally McBeal and Scream 2, and she's in the movie for less than twenty minutes.  I defy you to find the logic in this.So what we have here is a miserable addition to the ""end times"" cadre of films that experienced a mercifully short life in '99.  It had a few chilling visuals but in the end it utterly squandered any potential it may have had.

It should please many of the genre's fans.Father Andrew Keirnan was a scientist before he became a priest. He has an interesting job. He works directly for the Vatican and travels the world checking out reported visions and miracles. Most of these turn out to be bogus, but in South America, he witnesses an event that he cannot disprove. Upon the death of a priest there, a statue of the Virgin Mary in the local church begins to weep blood. While all this is going on, a boy steals the dead priest's rosary and sells it to an American tourist, who sends it to her daughter as a present. As soon as it arrives, the girl begins to experience a condition know as the stigmata. She begins to suffer the wounds that Christ suffered on the cross. What makes it all the more mysterious is that the girl isn't Catholic. In fact, she doesn't even believe in God. Father Keirnan becomes involved in ways he never dreamed possible. And a Cardinal back in Rome is willing to do anything to hush the whole matter up.Patricia Arquette is marvelous as the victim, Frankie Page. She throws herself into the role, and while it isn't a part worth losing sleep over, I can't help but admire Arquette's energy. She should have a long and successful career. Gabriel Byrne gives his usual serviceable performance as Father Keirnan, a man who long ago lost his own faith. Jonathan Price is suitably creepy as the nefarious Cardinal Houserman, while Nia Long does okay in the thankless role of Frankie's best friend.This brings us to the fly in the ointment - the plot. The Catholic church was particularly upset over Stigmata. I'm not Catholic, so to me it was basically just another movie. Still, the whole thing is illogical, and I suspect that the screenwriter was either a former Catholic with something against the Church or someone who didn't do their research. The stigmata is supposed to be the blood of Christ. It would seem that, if such an experience really occurred, it would bring the person to a higher plane of existence. Instead, after a particularly horrific episode, Frankie and her friend decide that the best idea is to go to the local disco. After all, it's Friday night. Later, Frankie goes through a demonic possession straight out of The Exorcist. This scene is in total opposition to the original notion that she is made to suffer for the purpose of some greater good. The story becomes a muddled mess of theological mayhem, but I do not think the Church will suffer any irreparable harm from this Hollywood Stigmata.",3,"Absurd plot, of course, but  still chilling horror flick",1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,2657,"['Stigmata', 'did', 'well', 'boxoffice', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'off', 'well', 'made', 'horror/thriller', 'should', 'please', 'many', 'genre', 'fans.Father', 'Andrew', 'Keirnan', 'was', 'scientist', 'became', 'priest', 'interesting', 'job', 'directly', 'Vatican', 'travels', 'world', 'checking', 'out', 'reported', 'visions', 'miracles', 'Most', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'bogus', 'South', 'America', 'event', 'can', 'not', 'disprove', 'death', 'priest', 'there', 'statue', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'local', 'church', 'weep', 'blood', 'going', 'boy', 'dead', 'priest', 'rosary', 'American', 'tourist', 'who', 'daughter', 'present', 'As', 'soon', 'girl', 'experience', 'condition', 'know', 'stigmata', 'suffer', 'wounds', 'Christ', 'suffered', 'cross', 'What', 'more', 'mysterious', 'girl', ""n't"", 'Catholic', 'fact', ""n't"", 'even', 'believe', 'God', 'Father', 'Keirnan', 'involved', 'ways', 'never', 'dreamed', 'possible', 'Cardinal', 'back', 'Rome', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'hush', 'whole', 'matter', 'up.Patricia', 'Arquette', 'marvelous', 'victim', 'Frankie', 'Page', 'role', ""n't"", 'part', 'worth', 'losing', 'sleep', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire', 'Arquette', 'energy', 'should', 'have', 'long', 'successful', 'career', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'usual', 'serviceable', 'performance', 'Father', 'Keirnan', 'man', 'who', 'long', 'ago', 'lost', 'own', 'faith', 'Jonathan', 'Price', 'suitably', 'creepy', 'nefarious', 'Cardinal', 'Houserman', 'Nia', 'Long', 'okay', 'thankless', 'role', 'Frankie', 'best', 'friend.This', 'fly', 'ointment', 'plot', 'Catholic', 'church', 'was', 'particularly', 'upset', 'over', 'Stigmata', ""'m"", 'not', 'Catholic', 'so', 'was', 'basically', 'just', 'movie', 'Still', 'whole', 'thing', 'illogical', 'suspect', 'screenwriter', 'was', 'former', 'Catholic', 'something', 'Church', 'someone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'research', 'stigmata', 'supposed', 'be', 'blood', 'Christ', 'would', 'seem', 'such', 'experience', 'really', 'occurred', 'would', 'bring', 'person', 'higher', 'plane', 'existence', 'Instead', 'particularly', 'horrific', 'episode', 'Frankie', 'friend', 'decide', 'best', 'idea', 'go', 'local', 'disco', 'Friday', 'night', 'Later', 'Frankie', 'demonic', 'possession', 'straight', 'Exorcist', 'scene', 'total', 'opposition', 'original', 'notion', 'made', 'suffer', 'purpose', 'greater', 'good', 'story', 'muddled', 'mess', 'theological', 'mayhem', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Church', 'will', 'suffer', 'irreparable', 'harm', 'Hollywood', 'Stigmata']",Stigmata VHS

If you're devoutly religious, then you'll know what the stigmata is. I've never heard of it, and I found I learned quite a lot - what the stigmata's are, where they appear etc. And finding out some cool trivia - every crucifix, whether on a necklace or in a church, is technically 'wrong'. Christ did not have the nails driven through his palms, cos the nails would just rip right through the flesh. Instead, the nails were driven through the wrists, which is more correct. And this is where the marks appear on Patricia Arquette.Who, by the way, is a great actress! Apart from her, I could have seen Cate Blanchett in this role, but Patricia Arquette plays the part of Frankie almost too well. It's very realistic, and you have to remind yourself it's just a film.The beginning credits have some very cool scenes, which is a quick look at what Frankie is like. Her life is full of clubbing, hairdressing, and guys. And she's in no way religious. Kinda obvious what's going to happen, considering the best part of the film is about religion.Some of the scenes featuring flashbacks to the stigmatas/Christ are very realistic and too scary to watch. They happen very abruptly, and in the weirdest places, for no apparent reason. It's almost painful to watch Patricia Arquette act out receiving the stigmatas.I found this film quite good, and learned a bit from it.

Eventually the Vatican gets to hear of it and send miracle detective Father Kiernan (Byrne) to find out if it's a true miracle.  Upon arrival it soon becomes apparent that this is no ordinary case: Frankie is experiencing more of the five wounds of Christ than any stigmatic ever has before and, anyway, she doesn't believe in God.Obviously there's a lot of comparisons to be made to 'The Exorcist', but this is actually an entirely different movie.  For one thing, it's about as modern as any movie could hope to be, with techno music and electric photography.  Secondly there's a lot here to suggest that this isn't your usual horror.  Interestingly, rather than focusing squarely on Frankie's personal hell it also takes into accounts the Church as Father Kiernan discovers an elaborate conspiracy in the Vatican.  It turns out that Frankie is more than just a stigmatic but is trying to uncover the secret of an entirely new gospel, that of Jesus' own words.This plot is not only controversial but incredibly interesting in a day when most modern horror movies merely ape their predecessors.  Here the hope doesn't lie in religion, in fact it's the exact opposite, with the Church being portrayed as a powerful and anything but benevolent force.  Doubtless this will offend many, although the concept is nothing short of original.The acting is very good indeed as well, especially Arquette and Byrne as the two leads.  Plus, despite not being especially frightening, the violent scenes have been directed with great care, looking a lot more at Frankie than at the act itself.  It's not often that you can call a horror movie visually arresting.

474268,A2L7WYA5OENV03,6305718903,Reticuli,"[4, 5]","I need to address some comments made by Pat McCullough.  I agree that the film takes some liberty in saying that the Gospel of Thomas predates the New Testament.  At the very least it comes from the same period as Mathew and Luke.  However, it shows a striking resemblance to the hypothetical source document for those gospels, the &quot;Q&quot;, which must have existed in parallel to the Gospel of Mark for Mathew and Luke to be written.  It is this still hypothetical Q Gospel that may have possibly predated even the earliest version of Mark, which was probably written around 40 AD.  And Coptic is considered a form of Egyptian, not Greek.  A fragment of an earlier version written in Greek had already been discovered, so it is presumed that the original language of the Gospel of Thomas is Greek, which makes sense if one assumes it to be a partially Gnosticized version of the Q (Gnostics were like a cross between the Greek Sophists and early Christians).  The idea that Jesus was anti-orthodoxy, however, is not a uniquely Gnostic trait and still survived to some degree in the New Testament.  So even if one throws out the goofy anti-flesh &amp; circular philosophy portions of Thomas, you could still end up with a resemblance of the Q Gospel saying such things as &quot;the kingdom of heaven is inside you and all around you, but you do not realize it&quot;.

474269,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305718903,Reviewer,"[3, 8]","An ambitious project that falls short because it tries too hard to be more than it is, ""Stigmata,"" directed by Rupert Wainwright proffers itself on one hand as a scholarly endeavor, while on the other it gives way to blatant sensationalism.  Writers Tom Lazarus and Rick Ramage use the pretext of examining the suppression of the Gospel of Thomas to weave an unlikely story of a young woman, Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette), an atheist living in Pittsburgh, who is afflicted with the stigmata.  Ultimately, the Vatican sends in Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) to investigate.  Kiernan is not only a priest, but a scientist; his job is to travel the world and document alleged miracles or supernatural occurrences with overtones that may have some bearing on the Universal Church.  It's an interesting premise, somewhat engrossing up to a point, and something of a mystery; enough, in fact, that the writers should have quit while they were somewhat ahead.  Instead they attempted to add more intrigue to the mystery by introducing subjective ruminations concerning corrupt political machinations of the Church into the story, specifically in the guise of one Cardinal Daniel Houseman (Jonathan Pryce), who seems bent on keeping the ""truth"" about the ""real"" teachings of Jesus hidden away.  And why?  To protect the Church.  It asserts that the Church is more interested in icons and wealth than it is about evangelizing the Word of The Living God, and it's just not so.  The disturbing thing about it is that it's told in such a way as to have the audience believe that there is some basis in truth to it all, including a brief epilogue that attempts to give it the credibility of documentation.  All it does, however, is take a somewhat entertaining piece of fiction down to the level of tabloid exploitation that casts a pall over the entire project.  Which is a shame, because taken at face value and purely as entertainment, this is a decent movie, with notable performances, especially by Arquette and Byrne.  Pryce unfortunately doesn't come off quite as well, but it has nothing to do with his ability as an actor; it's more a case of the messenger taking one for the team.  There was really little he could do with his character, as it was written to be a means to an end, inundated with cliche and totally lacking in credibility.  It's a shame that an actor of Pryce's stature should have been shackled with such a role, though presumably he was not forced to do it; to which one can only say that even good actors occasionally make bad choices.  Besides Lazarus and Ramage, director Wainwright is culpable as well, for attempting to sell a story of unsound (and unfounded) theological postulations to an unsuspecting audience (but then again, that's his job).  But it lands him in some pretty murky waters; better he should have stayed within the waters of Spielberg and ""Jaws,"" rather than make a shallow imitation of ""The Exorcist"" minus the integrity of that film.  In the final analysis, ""Stigmata"" is a movie about faith and truth that is inherently dishonest, which makes it nothing less than contradictory at it's core.  Performance wise and visually, it has it's moments; unfortunately, all of the positive aspects of the film are denigrated by the message.  And that's a shame.

While many of you may be turned off imediately by a film with a title like &quot;Stigmata&quot;, this is a great film. Stigmata is about persons with a deep religious faith who take  on the outward signs of crusifixtion as Christ did. These people develop  thorn cuts on their heads, bleed from the hands and feet, and wounds in  their side. This is a film that brings elements of possible demonic  possessions with the response of the Catholic Church. At times the audience  may wince at the gore but also be entertained at how it is presented. As I  sat watching this film, I wondered what I would do if I encountered a  person floating in the air hanging on an imaginary cross....would calling  911 bring the relief or help I seek? I could just imagine a Milwaukee cop  showing up and quickly leaving (but still having enough time to stop and  give me a parking ticket first.) This film will cause you to wonder....do  these things really happen? Do other religions other than Catholics have  stigmatas, and how come they don't make movies with non-Catholic priests  responding....here comes Jim or Tammy Faye to take care of a demon, now  that might sell. The film is well done, it keeps your attention, it  challenges you, and is well acted and filmed. Bottom line...if you are  looking for a thriller that leaves you questioning a few components of your  personal faith, then this film is for you.",4,First of all...I really liked it.,950486400,"02 14, 2000",2000,1438,"['First', '.I', 'really', 'liked', 'many', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'imediately', 'film', 'title', 'quot', 'Stigmata', 'quot', 'great', 'film', 'Stigmata', 'persons', 'deep', 'religious', 'faith', 'who', 'take', 'outward', 'signs', 'crusifixtion', 'Christ', 'did', 'people', 'develop', 'thorn', 'cuts', 'heads', 'bleed', 'hands', 'feet', 'wounds', 'side', 'film', 'elements', 'possible', 'demonic', 'possessions', 'response', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'times', 'audience', 'may', 'wince', 'gore', 'also', 'be', 'entertained', 'how', 'presented', 'sat', 'watching', 'film', 'wondered', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'encountered', 'person', 'floating', 'air', 'hanging', 'imaginary', 'cross', 'calling', '911', 'bring', 'relief', 'help', 'seek', 'could', 'just', 'imagine', 'Milwaukee', 'cop', 'showing', 'up', 'quickly', 'leaving', 'still', 'having', 'enough', 'time', 'stop', 'give', 'parking', 'ticket', 'first', 'film', 'will', 'cause', 'wonder', 'things', 'really', 'happen', 'Do', 'other', 'religions', 'other', 'Catholics', 'have', 'stigmatas', 'how', 'come', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'non-Catholic', 'priests', 'responding', '.here', 'Jim', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'take', 'care', 'demon', 'now', 'might', 'sell', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'attention', 'well', 'acted', 'filmed', 'Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'looking', 'thriller', 'questioning', 'few', 'components', 'personal', 'faith', 'then', 'film']",Stigmata VHS

Gabriel Byrne-- okay, well, every woman I know thinks he's the bees' knees. Jonathan Pryce really CAN play a scary guy. Interesting soundtrack, if a  little on the silly side (are you really going to hear pop electronica at  any club whose main piece of decor is chain link fence, one wonders?). Very  loose basing on factual events surrounding Nag Hammadi, and I mean VERY  loose (Brazilian priest yes, possessed stigmatic no). And despite this odd  wave of religious-themed media these days, film, at least, seems to be  taking a more intelligent approach to it than television. Instead of  mindless pap like Touched by an Angel and Providence, Stigmata seems to be  drawing from the Blatty/Friedkin axis, and that cannot ever be a bad thing  (well, okay, except for Exorcist II). You know the plot, right? Atheist  suddenly finds herself plagued with Christ's wounds, speaking in dead  languages, and writing on the walls of her apartment. Actually, it kind of  reminds me of a sexy blond John Denver in Oh, God. Happily, Byrne is a lot  more attractive than George Burns was.Once again, I walked out of  the theater with a sense of underwhelment that stemmed only from the film's  last ten minutes, just like in Sleepy Hollow. Stigmata is a stylized,  slick, well-processed tour-de-force right up until the end, where instead  of wrapping things up nicely (despite the fact that things COULD have been  wrapped up nicely quite easily, in any one of five or six different ways),  suddenly the screen goes black and we get some overlay text about Nag  Hammadi. All well and good, but what happened? Do Gabe and Patty get  married, go off, and make babies? Does Patty kick off and get a really nice  funeral? Does Gabe ever actually finish getting the haircut Patty starts to  give him? Does Patty's not-so-significant other get jealous and kill them  both in a fit of rage? And is that stupid statue really a miracle? All this  and more... we dunno. Still, I'd prefer the loose ends rather than Sleepy  Hollow's artificial tying-together, if not by much.(Note: I have been  told by others who saw the DVD version that it contains an alternate ending  that wraps everything up... so you may want to shell out the extra for the  DVD version.)",3,Strong film... weak ending,961286400,"06 18, 2000",2000,2316,"['So', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'cheap', 'seats', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'yum', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'okay', 'well', 'woman', 'know', 'bees', 'knees', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'really', 'CAN', 'play', 'scary', 'guy', 'Interesting', 'soundtrack', 'little', 'silly', 'side', 'are', 'really', 'going', 'hear', 'pop', 'electronica', 'club', 'main', 'piece', 'decor', 'chain', 'link', 'fence', 'one', 'wonders', 'Very', 'loose', 'basing', 'factual', 'events', 'surrounding', 'Nag', 'Hammadi', 'mean', 'VERY', 'loose', 'Brazilian', 'priest', 'yes', 'possessed', 'stigmatic', 'odd', 'wave', 'religious-themed', 'media', 'days', 'film', 'least', 'be', 'taking', 'more', 'intelligent', 'approach', 'television', 'Instead', 'mindless', 'pap', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'Providence', 'Stigmata', 'be', 'drawing', 'Blatty/Friedkin', 'axis', 'can', 'not', 'ever', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'well', 'Exorcist', 'II', 'know', 'plot', 'right', 'Atheist', 'suddenly', 'plagued', 'Christ', 'wounds', 'speaking', 'dead', 'languages', 'writing', 'walls', 'apartment', 'Actually', 'kind', 'reminds', 'sexy', 'blond', 'John', 'Denver', 'Oh', 'God', 'Happily', 'Byrne', 'lot', 'more', 'attractive', 'George', 'Burns', 'was.Once', 'again', 'walked', 'theater', 'sense', 'underwhelment', 'stemmed', 'only', 'film', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'just', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'Stigmata', 'stylized', 'slick', 'well-processed', 'tour-de-force', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'where', 'instead', 'wrapping', 'things', 'up', 'nicely', 'fact', 'things', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nicely', 'quite', 'easily', 'one', 'five', 'six', 'different', 'ways', 'suddenly', 'screen', 'black', 'get', 'overlay', 'text', 'Nag', 'Hammadi', 'All', 'well', 'good', 'what', 'happened', 'Do', 'Gabe', 'Patty', 'get', 'married', 'go', 'off', 'make', 'babies', 'Does', 'Patty', 'kick', 'off', 'get', 'really', 'nice', 'funeral', 'Does', 'Gabe', 'ever', 'actually', 'finish', 'getting', 'haircut', 'Patty', 'give', 'Does', 'Patty', 'not-so-significant', 'other', 'get', 'jealous', 'kill', 'fit', 'rage', 'stupid', 'statue', 'really', 'miracle', 'more', 'dunno', 'Still', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'loose', 'rather', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'artificial', 'tying-together', 'not', 'much', 'Note', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'others', 'who', 'saw', 'DVD', 'version', 'alternate', 'ending', 'wraps', 'everything', 'up', 'so', 'may', 'want', 'shell', 'out', 'extra', 'DVD', 'version']",Stigmata VHS

That's where the whole plot starts. Next, Patricia Arquette's character begins experiencing cataclymic changes in her life that makes everyone think she is losing her mind. For example, she causes one huge destruction on a subway train while being beaten on her back repeatedly by an unseen force. She also gets bloody holes in her palms. The same thing happens 2 times and she is sent to the hospital 2 times, and a  bunch of other really strange stuff happens that she can't explain. My guess is because she said she isn't religious in this movie. Her character then writes  either latin or aramiac on the wall and, in another scene, shouts that language in a male voice. Every answer leads to another question and her only hope is an exorcism. It seems like another kind of ""Exorcist"" movie to me. If it sounds good to you, I recommend it.

474278,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,6305718903,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[3, 3]","""Stigmata"" is a thought provoking, if sometimes religiously confused, MTVesque journey through the possession/stigmata of Frankie Page (Patricia Arquette), a twentysomething atheist raver who suddenly exhibits stigmata (the wounds that Christ received on the cross) after receiving a recently deceased priest's rosary in the mail (her name, combined with later symbolism (the doves feeding from her hands, the statue of St. Francis in the garden), is an obvious nod to St. Francis of Assisi-one of the original working titles was ""St. Frankie of Pittsburgh""). However, director Rupert Wainwright appears fundamentally confused on basic issues, confusing stigmata (which appear to devout Christians) with possession (Frankie speaks in tongues, stabs herself, levitates, and scribbles in Aramaic on the walls).Gabriel Byrne is fantastic (as usual) as Father Andrew Kiernan, an Irish organic chemist turned man of the cloth, who is sent around the globe to investigate bleeding statues and religious sightings. Frankie has an attack in the subway that is witnessed by a priest, and word filters down to the Vatican, where Father Kiernan is hastily reassigned after discovering an authentic bleeding statue of the Virgin Mary in Brazil. Angry at being silenced, Kiernan arrives to find Frankie seeing hallucinations, hearing voices, and sporting some gaping holes in her wrists (the hospital staff fears self-mutilation and suicide attempts) that continue to bleed.The film follows the pair as Frankie's condition deteriorates and the attacks become more violent as another mystery, this one inside the walls of the Vatican, unfolds.  The ""Stigmata"" tagline says it all: the messenger must be silenced. The explanation for the phenomenon is unexpected, as are the two different endings: the theatrical ending and the director's ending. Due to poor test screenings the theatrical ending was substituted, but Wainwright's ending fits in more with the predictions of Father Andrew. There are several deleted scenes, including an alternate opening that explains Father Almeida's death. Factual errors run rampant, including Father Kiernan's assertion that no one had ever received all five stigmata (untrue, St. Francis received all five at once), that St. Francis of Assisi was 23 when he first received the stigmata (he was in his forties), and the fact that Cardinal Houseman wears a goatee (prohibited by the Vatican).The visuals are striking if overwhelming. Multitudes of candles are present in almost every shot, as is water, doves, and blood. The scenes of Frankie receiving the stigmata are almost seizure-inducing-strobe lights, split-second flashes of nails being hammered into wrists, Frankie's bloodied face from several angles, all without transitions, rushed and drowned in a hard-rock soundtrack (the visuals alone built up a sufficient atmosphere of foreboding; the hard rock was overkill) penned by Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan. Sinead O'Connor and the Afro-Celt Sound System contribute, as does Natalie Imbruglia, and David Bowie.""Stigmata"" is entertaining, although it is extremely violent, gory, contains graphic sex, and is easily religiously offensive. There really is no Satanic demonic possession, rather something using Frankie as a messenger for good (albeit with extreme Machiavellian means).  The movie casts a less than flattering light on the Catholic Church and the Vatican, and seems to glorify Frankie's hedonistic lifestyle. But the stigmata and Father Kiernan inevitably leave a large impact on Frankie's life, Frankie, who was once so self-assured in her partying ways and the non-existence of God.

Because I'm not catholic, there were certain aspects of the movie I did not understand, but I still thought the movie was interesting.  For some people the subject matter may be a bit much, especially during some of the more violent scenes.  This film should have been in the thriller genre in my opinion.  This is not a horror film, but a supernatural thriller.  The film really delves into religion, and pulls out things we never knew about God. The movie is visually stunning. Slow motion effects of blood and water drips splashing spookily, statues crying and brilliant makeup and special effects. The film has a message, and if you don't pay attention, you may not truly understand what that message is. The film is about a young woman Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette), an atheist living in Pittsburgh, who is afflicted with the stigmata.  Which is unusual being that Stigmata's usually only occur in people who are devout.  Frankie starts going through this after receiving a gift from her mother.  Her mother on vacation in Brazil, sends her a rosary, that belongs to the recently deceased Father Alameida.The Vatican sends in Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) to investigate. Kiernan is not only a priest, but a scientist; his job is to travel the world and document alleged miracles or supernatural occurrences with overtones that may have some bearing on the Universal Church.Watching Frankie receive the Christ like wounds in her feet and hands is very intense.  When you see what is happening to Frankie as it happened to God while he was on the cross, you feel like you can actually hear the whip lashing, or feeling the nails going into your wrists. That aspect of the film is pretty amazing to me. I've seen the Exorcist, and to me there is no comparison between the two movies.  Frankie is not demonically possessed.  She is possessed by the spirit of Father Alameida.  Nia Long(The Best Man, Fresh Prince of Bell air) and Portia DeRossi(Ally McBeal, Arrested Development) have small roles in this movie.If you are into supernatural thrillers, are open minded, and like movies that are thought provoking, then this is an interesting movie to watch.",3,This movie should NOT be compared to the Exorcist.,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,2291,"[""'m"", 'not', 'religious', 'person', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'library', 'was', 'curious', 'decided', 'give', 'movie', 'look', ""'m"", 'not', 'catholic', 'were', 'certain', 'aspects', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'still', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'people', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'especially', 'more', 'violent', 'scenes', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'thriller', 'genre', 'opinion', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'film', 'really', 'religion', 'out', 'things', 'never', 'knew', 'God', 'movie', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Slow', 'motion', 'effects', 'blood', 'water', 'drips', 'splashing', 'spookily', 'statues', 'crying', 'brilliant', 'makeup', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'may', 'not', 'truly', 'understand', 'what', 'message', 'film', 'young', 'woman', 'Frankie', 'Paige', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'atheist', 'living', 'Pittsburgh', 'who', 'afflicted', 'stigmata', 'Which', 'unusual', 'being', 'Stigmata', 'usually', 'only', 'occur', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'devout', 'Frankie', 'going', 'receiving', 'gift', 'mother', 'mother', 'vacation', 'Brazil', 'rosary', 'recently', 'deceased', 'Father', 'Alameida.The', 'Vatican', 'Father', 'Andrew', 'Kiernan', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'investigate', 'Kiernan', 'not', 'only', 'priest', 'scientist', 'job', 'travel', 'world', 'document', 'alleged', 'miracles', 'supernatural', 'occurrences', 'overtones', 'may', 'have', 'bearing', 'Universal', 'Church.Watching', 'Frankie', 'receive', 'Christ', 'wounds', 'feet', 'hands', 'very', 'intense', 'When', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'Frankie', 'happened', 'God', 'was', 'cross', 'feel', 'can', 'actually', 'hear', 'whip', 'lashing', 'feeling', 'nails', 'going', 'wrists', 'aspect', 'film', 'pretty', 'amazing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Exorcist', 'comparison', 'two', 'movies', 'Frankie', 'not', 'demonically', 'possessed', 'possessed', 'spirit', 'Father', 'Alameida', 'Nia', 'Long', 'Best', 'Man', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bell', 'air', 'Portia', 'DeRossi', 'Ally', 'McBeal', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'have', 'small', 'roles', 'movie.If', 'are', 'supernatural', 'thrillers', 'are', 'open', 'minded', 'movies', 'are', 'thought', 'provoking', 'then', 'interesting', 'movie', 'watch']",Stigmata VHS

The 5.1 surround is also a plus, as the eerie score comes at you from all  directions.

The scenes are a longer more explicit sex scene between Frankie and Steve, a alternative beginning where Alameda kills himself by jumping off the church, a scene where Frankie is in the salon alone and stuff starts flying around poltergeist fashion, a scene where Frankie kicks Steve out of her apartment after a fight, a more explicit scene where Frankie stabs her wrist and finally a alternative ending where it is implied that Frankie dies.

It takes a real hit on Catholicism, and at times, religion in general. Obviously, ""Stigmata"" isn't a film for all audiences, people with strong religious beliefs, for instance, and is certainly not appropriate for younger viewers. The production has so many good qualities, it's a shame to ultimately conceive that the flaw that sunk the motion picture is not its story or characters, but the individual scenes themselves.  Director Rupert Wainwright succeeds in making a very intense, engrossing picture; however, ""Stigmata"" is a jigsaw puzzle in which there are many interestingly shaped and colorful pieces, but, unfortunately, they do not fit together to create a final piece of work.The film opens with an acclaimed and dedicated Priest/scientist named Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Bryne in a fine performance) investigating a bizarre occurrence in a Brazilian church where a religious statue bled from its eyes. After noticing a few unique things in this town, however, after he returns home to Cardinal Daniel Houseman (Jonathan Pryce), Kiernan pleads to be sent back to this area to investigate further, but his requests are suspiciously denied. ""Stigmata""; however, centers on a young atheist woman named Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) lives an independent life in Pittsburgh where she is occupied as a hair stylist with her fellow coworkers, including close friend Donna (Nia Long).  Things drastically heat up for Frankie after she receives a rather significant gift from her mother who was shopping on vacation. This is an item from a salesperson off the streets whom himself stole from a dead Brazilian priest. Soon, Frankie begins to suffer violent, disturbing visions and appearing on her afterwards are wounds resembling the ones suffered by Christ, a symptom called the stigmata.After more and more stigmata attacks are inflicted on Frankie, Kiernan is sent to Pittsburgh where he investigates. It is when Frankie explains to Kiernan that she does not believe in God when he then denies the occurring stigmata attacks on her. You see, usually the stigmata happens to deeply religious Catholics, and Frankie is anything but; on the other hand, never before has each one of the five stigmatic wounds taken place on one individual person, and by the time this film is over, guess how many Frankie will have suffered. ""Stigmata"" contains the kind of plot that I liked to experience; a deep, involved and revealing storyline that focuses on touchy subjects. The characters are lost in their dialogue, but if the audience buys the premise, they allow themselves to be sucked in the events that transpire. The person who I saw this movie with found the plot too absorbing for her, and I have a feeling that this is how the majority of an audience will feel, therefore, although it is a close call for me, I am not recommending the film. I do feel, however, that there is a group of individuals out there who, like I somewhat was able to do, will happen to enjoy this production for what it is worth. If the film fit together a bit more, I think there may have been much potential here. But in the end, ""Stigmata,"" gets lost in its controversial atmosphere and forgets that movies like this need explanation and a through-line, not brief grizzly scenes that repeat themselves over and over again.",3,Stigmata  (1999),1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,3606,"['Director', 'Rupert', 'WainwrightCast', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'Gabriel', 'Bryne', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'Nia', 'Long', 'Thomas', 'Kopache', 'Rade', 'Serbedzija', 'Enrico', 'Colantoni', 'Dick', 'Latessa', 'Portia', 'Rossi.Running', 'Time', '103', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'intense', 'violent', 'sequences', 'language', 'sexuality.Stigmata', 'very', 'strange', 'film', 'real', 'hit', 'Catholicism', 'times', 'religion', 'general', 'Obviously', 'Stigmata', ""n't"", 'film', 'audiences', 'people', 'strong', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'instance', 'certainly', 'not', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'viewers', 'production', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'qualities', 'shame', 'ultimately', 'conceive', 'flaw', 'sunk', 'motion', 'picture', 'not', 'story', 'characters', 'individual', 'scenes', 'Director', 'Rupert', 'Wainwright', 'making', 'very', 'intense', 'engrossing', 'picture', 'however', 'Stigmata', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'are', 'many', 'interestingly', 'shaped', 'colorful', 'pieces', 'unfortunately', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'together', 'create', 'final', 'piece', 'work.The', 'film', 'acclaimed', 'dedicated', 'Priest/scientist', 'named', 'Andrew', 'Kiernan', 'Gabriel', 'Bryne', 'fine', 'performance', 'investigating', 'bizarre', 'occurrence', 'Brazilian', 'church', 'where', 'religious', 'statue', 'bled', 'eyes', 'noticing', 'few', 'unique', 'things', 'town', 'however', 'home', 'Cardinal', 'Daniel', 'Houseman', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'Kiernan', 'be', 'sent', 'back', 'area', 'investigate', 'further', 'requests', 'are', 'suspiciously', 'denied', 'Stigmata', 'however', 'centers', 'young', 'atheist', 'woman', 'named', 'Frankie', 'Paige', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'independent', 'life', 'Pittsburgh', 'where', 'occupied', 'hair', 'stylist', 'fellow', 'coworkers', 'including', 'close', 'friend', 'Donna', 'Nia', 'Long', 'Things', 'drastically', 'heat', 'up', 'Frankie', 'rather', 'significant', 'gift', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'shopping', 'vacation', 'item', 'salesperson', 'streets', 'whom', 'stole', 'dead', 'Brazilian', 'priest', 'Soon', 'Frankie', 'suffer', 'violent', 'disturbing', 'visions', 'appearing', 'afterwards', 'are', 'resembling', 'ones', 'suffered', 'Christ', 'symptom', 'called', 'stigmata.After', 'more', 'more', 'stigmata', 'attacks', 'are', 'inflicted', 'Frankie', 'Kiernan', 'sent', 'Pittsburgh', 'where', 'when', 'Frankie', 'Kiernan', 'not', 'believe', 'God', 'when', 'then', 'occurring', 'stigmata', 'attacks', 'see', 'usually', 'stigmata', 'deeply', 'religious', 'Catholics', 'Frankie', 'anything', 'other', 'hand', 'never', 'before', 'one', 'five', 'stigmatic', 'wounds', 'taken', 'place', 'one', 'individual', 'person', 'time', 'film', 'guess', 'how', 'many', 'Frankie', 'will', 'have', 'suffered', 'Stigmata', 'kind', 'plot', 'liked', 'experience', 'deep', 'involved', 'revealing', 'storyline', 'touchy', 'subjects', 'characters', 'are', 'lost', 'dialogue', 'audience', 'premise', 'allow', 'be', 'sucked', 'events', 'transpire', 'person', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'found', 'plot', 'too', 'absorbing', 'have', 'feeling', 'how', 'majority', 'audience', 'will', 'feel', 'therefore', 'close', 'call', 'am', 'not', 'recommending', 'film', 'do', 'feel', 'however', 'group', 'individuals', 'who', 'somewhat', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'will', 'happen', 'enjoy', 'production', 'what', 'worth', 'film', 'fit', 'together', 'bit', 'more', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'potential', 'here', 'end', 'Stigmata', 'lost', 'controversial', 'atmosphere', 'forgets', 'movies', 'need', 'explanation', 'through-line', 'not', 'brief', 'grizzly', 'scenes', 'repeat', 'over', 'again']",Stigmata VHS

All told, Stigmata is a rather uneven effort, but one with a thought-provoking combination of theology and thrills served up in a thoroughly modern, stylish package. Gabriel Byrne plays Father Kiernan, a young Jesuit priest whose degree in chemistry makes him a sort of priest/detective as he investigates weeping Marys and the like around the world. Meanwhile, Frankie (Patricia Arquette), a rave-generation Pittsburgher, is afflicted with the stigmata--holes that appear in her wrists, resembling the wounds of Christ. The young woman's symptoms filter back to the Vatican and Father Kiernan is assigned to the case. The priest is puzzled by Frankie's atheism; usually the stigmata only appear on the devout (hence the age-old controversy of miracles vs. hysteria).

(pun intended) But when I saw the cast, and found a copy of the video for cheap, I had to investigate.Both Burne and Arquette were wonderful in this, and the visual images were arresting and beautiful. (The flashes of images of crucifixion made religious stories so much more real to me than dunking one's head in a bucket o' blood, like Some Other Movies have done.) But I found the point of the movie to be thrilling, and it instigated in me a lot of new thought and hope.I was so glad to see how many other people have questioned religion without giving up faith -- or the quest for truth. I had heard of the Nag Hammadi Gospels, but didn't really know what they were. This was a lovely way to introduce me to them, and it inspired me to check them out.The teachings of the man who threw the moneychangers out of the temple, who came to tell people that there's more to religion than sacrificing a pigeon, have been turned into another monstrous institution that crushes people under the wheels of its machinery. This film dares to question what this Religion has become, and to invite people to hear the words of a simple rabbi in Galilee, who -- far from owning the world's most expensive real estate -- owned nothing more than the clothes on his back.Great entertainment, intriguing and thought-provoking, and a reward for those who don't follow The Gospel of Movie Critics.",5,Opened new windows in my mind,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,1467,"['do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'watch', 'kind', 'movie', 'thougth', 'was', 'avoid', 'religiously', 'pun', 'intended', 'when', 'saw', 'cast', 'found', 'copy', 'video', 'cheap', 'had', 'investigate.Both', 'Burne', 'Arquette', 'were', 'wonderful', 'visual', 'images', 'were', 'arresting', 'beautiful', 'flashes', 'images', 'crucifixion', 'made', 'religious', 'stories', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'real', 'dunking', 'one', 'head', 'bucket', 'o', 'blood', 'Other', 'Movies', 'have', 'done', 'found', 'point', 'movie', 'be', 'thrilling', 'instigated', 'lot', 'new', 'thought', 'hope.I', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'questioned', 'religion', 'giving', 'up', 'faith', 'quest', 'truth', 'had', 'heard', 'Nag', 'Hammadi', 'Gospels', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'was', 'lovely', 'way', 'introduce', 'inspired', 'check', 'out.The', 'teachings', 'man', 'who', 'threw', 'moneychangers', 'temple', 'who', 'came', 'tell', 'people', 'more', 'religion', 'sacrificing', 'pigeon', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'monstrous', 'institution', 'people', 'wheels', 'machinery', 'film', 'question', 'what', 'Religion', 'become', 'invite', 'people', 'hear', 'words', 'simple', 'rabbi', 'Galilee', 'who', 'far', 'owning', 'world', 'most', 'expensive', 'real', 'estate', 'owned', 'nothing', 'more', 'clothes', 'back.Great', 'entertainment', 'intriguing', 'thought-provoking', 'reward', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Gospel', 'Movie', 'Critics']",Stigmata VHS

Maybe I am wrong, but I felt the movie wanted to say that ""god is everywhere"" and that human beings do not need someone to stand between them and god. My feelings about religion were always such that religion is supposed to bring happiness, comfort and support and not engage in war, conflicts and guilt or the acquisition of power.Another reason for liking this movie was Patricia Arquett. She is so sweet, candid and fresh that her ""purity"" seems to come out of the screen. You do believe she was somehow ""chosen"" even if the necklace reached her hands by coincidence.As for my criticism. This movie can be described as an horror/thriller. Frankie Page, a hairdresser is starting to hallucinate and have outbursts of acute pains, causing severe wounds in her body. These turn out to be very typical of a situation called Stigmata where strong believers in Christianity totally identify with the suffering of Jesus Christ.An investigator, sent by the church to check on this case, is drawn to Frankie and keeps on inquiring her case in spite of the fact that she is no believer, a basic criteria for stigmata. As typical to thrillers, our investigator is alone without any help from outside sources. As usual the whole (Christian) world is against him. As usual our investigator arrives in the last moment to save the day. However, the movie, and especially its last part is filled with ""horror""/unnatural parts which were much too much for my taste. I liked the first part of the movie when we did not know yet what is true and what isn't and I was waiting for a logical explanation for everything we saw. I like to be on the thin line between reality and the unnatural, but this film moves towards the unreal in a very firm way. I could accept some ""miracles"", especially since the movie explains in such a beautiful way how people ""need"" the miracles and how such signs of god become the cornerstone of their belief, yet it was a little too muchI would like to add that the movie succeeded in presenting Jesus suffering in a way that makes him, so I felt, closer to any human being (this coming from a Jew) in the sense that one cannot remain indifferent to his suffering after ""feeling"" them together with Frankie.

At the basis of this overwrought dreck is a Catholic conspiracy revolving around a hidden gospel written by Jesus himself. A gospel that the church doesn't want anyone to know about. Their line of thought focuses on the belief that this testament would somehow challenge the basic tenants of Catholic faith. Most pointedly in the removal of a mid-point between man and god. Essentially saying that you wouldn't have to talk to god through the church and follow it's methods of repentance, (hail marys and whatnot). Unfortunately for the pretentious drivel that is Stigmata, there is a simple flaw that makes this film completely null and void. Apparently everyone involved in the production of Stigmata wasn't aware that all evolutions of protestant faith are already based on the iconoclastic tenant of a direct connection with god. Growing up a baptist I am well aware of it. I'm also aware that it's nothing new, and catholocism isn't any worse for wear because of it. Stigmata's intensely self involved delusion is, quite frankly, pathetic. That this film actually caused any ripples whatsoever in the Catholic community is beyond me.Beyond that more obvious failing, this film has loads more. Logic leaps and plot contrivances are par for the course. We also get to revel in and underlying cheapness. This is most apparent in the occasionl and utterly pointless nudity of Patricia Arquette. Not that she's not a pleasure to look at, but it doesn't serve any purpose other than a thrill. Neither do the over stylized and over loud effects. At one point she is possessed by some kind of demon who procedes to toss Byrne around, trashing the place. The only reason it happens is so they could have some sort of evil and menacing presence in all this mumbo jumbo.

He had just investigated a case of stigmata, namely evidence of reopening the wounds Christ sustained on the cross at Calvary, in the case of a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary at a church in a small Brazilian town.  He observed the evidence of blood appearing in the appropriate places on the statue.Byrne is stymied when his immediate superior, Jonathan Pryce, a cardinal stationed at the Vatican, dampens his enthusiasm and then sends him on to a case in Pittsburgh, which involved Arquette, whom he meets at her place of employment, a beauty parlor.  Initially he states his conviction that future investigation is unnecessary.  His reasoning is that in former cases of individuals bearing the stigmata, such as St. Francis of Assisi and, more recently, the Italian Catholic priest Padre Pio, were all devout believers.Byrne and Arquette become strongly attracted to each other, and the priest concedes that he became a priest in later adulthood and had enjoyed conjugal relations before that point.  Eventually Pryce comes to Pittsburgh, and, behind Byrne's back, begins to perform an exorcism.  The drama heightens as does the clash between Byrne and Pryce over the direction of the Roman Catholic Church in regard to manifestations of stigmata and what they ultimately mean.The camera work is brilliant, as are the special effects revealing Arquette's experiences, but considering the importance of the doctrinal clash being posed, the issues could have been better fleshed out in the script.",3,A Clash of Forces,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,1958,"['British', 'director', 'Rupert', 'Wainwright', 'Stigmata', 'presents', 'sharply', 'clashing', 'forces', 'good', 'evil', 'petite', 'blonde', 'beauty', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'professed', 'atheist', 'attacked', 'spiritual', 'elements', 'same', 'manner', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'was', 'so', 'plagued', 'seventies', 'Exorcist', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Irish', 'actor', 'who', 'initially', 'gained', 'fame', 'stage', 'Dublin', 'famous', 'Abby', 'Playhouse', 'group', 'idealistic', 'young', 'priest', 'working', 'Rome', 'Vatican', 'had', 'just', 'investigated', 'case', 'stigmata', 'namely', 'evidence', 'reopening', 'wounds', 'Christ', 'sustained', 'cross', 'Calvary', 'case', 'statue', 'Blessed', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'church', 'small', 'Brazilian', 'town', 'observed', 'evidence', 'blood', 'appearing', 'appropriate', 'places', 'statue.Byrne', 'stymied', 'when', 'immediate', 'superior', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'cardinal', 'stationed', 'Vatican', 'enthusiasm', 'then', 'case', 'Pittsburgh', 'involved', 'Arquette', 'whom', 'place', 'employment', 'beauty', 'parlor', 'Initially', 'conviction', 'future', 'investigation', 'unnecessary', 'reasoning', 'former', 'cases', 'individuals', 'bearing', 'stigmata', 'such', 'St.', 'Francis', 'Assisi', 'more', 'recently', 'Italian', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Padre', 'Pio', 'were', 'devout', 'believers.Byrne', 'Arquette', 'become', 'strongly', 'attracted', 'other', 'priest', 'became', 'priest', 'later', 'adulthood', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'conjugal', 'relations', 'point', 'Eventually', 'Pryce', 'Pittsburgh', 'Byrne', 'back', 'perform', 'exorcism', 'drama', 'clash', 'Byrne', 'Pryce', 'direction', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'regard', 'manifestations', 'stigmata', 'what', 'ultimately', 'mean.The', 'camera', 'work', 'brilliant', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'revealing', 'Arquette', 'experiences', 'considering', 'importance', 'doctrinal', 'clash', 'being', 'posed', 'issues', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'fleshed', 'out', 'script']",Stigmata VHS
