A bit slow in a place or two, love the movie though. OSCAR is very entertaining. Stallone is not a bad funny actor, I like his funny stuff better than some of his action. BIG TROUBLE was pretty good too. Not really a &#34;bad&#34; movie in the pack. 2 discs... the only way I would have liked it better was if there were 3 discs, or maybe if it were cheaper. :)",5,Already had OSCAR,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,443,"['bought', 'pack', 'even', 'had', 'one', 'movie', 'already', 'THE', 'CREW', 'favorite', 'bit', 'slow', 'place', 'two', 'love', 'movie', 'OSCAR', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Stallone', 'not', 'bad', 'funny', 'actor', 'funny', 'stuff', 'better', 'action', 'BIG', 'TROUBLE', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'Not', 'really', '34', 'bad', '34', 'movie', 'pack', '2', 'discs', 'only', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'better', 'was', 'were', '3', 'discs', 'maybe', 'were', 'cheaper']",N/A

Oscar is OK and does have its moments but just does't come off as well as the other two in my opinion.

1540412,A369KP0JV77JYT,B00803PG3A,Jon,"[0, 0]","Well, I tried to find a copy of the movie adaptation of Dave Barry's hilarious and riveting book, Big Trouble, and all I could find were ridiculously-expensive copies and this three-movie set.  I remember many years ago watching each of the other two movies (The Crew and Oscar), in addition to Big Trouble, but neither were worth remembering to me - they are an added bonus for my purposes.Big Trouble has a very good cast of people.  Many were little-known at the time, such as Sofia Vergara, Jason Lee, Ben Foster, Zooey Deschanel, and perhaps others.  It is a goofy movie, and strays from the book in a few ways (but in ways that make sense for the film version), but it will make you crack up.  Dennis Farina deadpans throughout the movie like his character did in Snatch.Any movie that has a character ask annoyingly, ""was that a goat?"" after encountering a goat on the freeway can't be bad.",5,DVD worth buying just for Dave Barry's Big Trouble,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,897,"['Well', 'tried', 'find', 'copy', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Dave', 'Barry', 'hilarious', 'riveting', 'book', 'Big', 'Trouble', 'could', 'find', 'were', 'ridiculously-expensive', 'copies', 'three-movie', 'set', 'remember', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'watching', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'Crew', 'Oscar', 'addition', 'Big', 'Trouble', 'were', 'worth', 'remembering', 'are', 'added', 'bonus', 'purposes.Big', 'Trouble', 'very', 'good', 'cast', 'people', 'Many', 'were', 'little-known', 'time', 'such', 'Sofia', 'Vergara', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'perhaps', 'others', 'goofy', 'movie', 'strays', 'book', 'few', 'ways', 'ways', 'make', 'sense', 'film', 'version', 'will', 'make', 'crack', 'up', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'movie', 'character', 'did', 'Snatch.Any', 'movie', 'character', 'ask', 'annoyingly', 'was', 'goat', 'encountering', 'goat', 'freeway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad']",N/A

I would've bought The Crew just for the cast, but it's really funny.  Oscar is an all-time favorite at my house.  The plot, the timing, the clever humor makes this one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Sylvester Stallone may be best known for his action movies, but in my opinion, they don't hold a candle to Oscar.  Plus, Oscar is pretty family friendly without being maudlin or dull.
