There is nothing contrived or false, just honest storytelling with a little humor thrown in.

Seems others recall seeing this 25 years ago on cable, as I do, but have not been able to locate a copy to own. I was in radio at the time, and had a few lonely Christmases under my belt, so I was able to identify with this superb, quiet, witty comedy. If you like ""Local Hero"", you'll recognize similar devices here: the struggle between capitalism and individualism, the smart but oddball characters that never distract from the plot but decorate it, and the underlying sadness at a past that has no future. Even though I saw it twice in the mid '80s and never since, this is of my all time favorites. It's a real antidote to the smarmy, sugary junk Americans are drawn towards this time of year.There is another film of the same name, and it is exactly what I mean by ""smarmy and sugary"".

It's quirky, subtle, introspective, and delightful. The writing (Bill Forsyth) is clever, the acting (particularly Bill Patterson) is excellent, the soundtrack (Mark Knopfler/Dire Straits) is wonderful, and the cinematography/scenery of Glasgow in winter is magnificent. Bare in mind this isn't a Hollywood-made comedy (i.e. no potty gags aimed at 12-year-olds), so you have to pay attention to appreciate the humor. In addition, I struggled somewhat with the local accents my first go-around (I made the mistake of watching it late at night after a long day at work). Nevertheless, I can safely say this is the most intelligent and fun holiday film I've seen. Let's hope that Universal gets it together someday soon and releases this on DVD in Region 1.",5,"A different, yet perfect holiday film",1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,943,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'fill', 'schmaltzy', 'cloying', 'over-the-top', 'faux', 'heart-warming', 'Christmastime', 'movies', 'can', 'appreciate', 'good', 'films', 'then', 'Comfort', 'Joy', 'perfect', 'holiday', 'flicker', 'quirky', 'subtle', 'introspective', 'delightful', 'writing', 'Bill', 'Forsyth', 'clever', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Bill', 'Patterson', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'Mark', 'Knopfler/Dire', 'Straits', 'wonderful', 'cinematography/scenery', 'Glasgow', 'winter', 'magnificent', 'Bare', 'mind', ""n't"", 'Hollywood-made', 'comedy', 'i.e', 'potty', 'gags', 'aimed', '12-year-olds', 'so', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'addition', 'struggled', 'somewhat', 'local', 'accents', 'first', 'go-around', 'made', 'mistake', 'watching', 'late', 'night', 'long', 'day', 'work', 'Nevertheless', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'most', 'intelligent', 'fun', 'holiday', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Let', 'hope', 'Universal', 'together', 'someday', 'soon', 'DVD', 'Region', '1']",Comfort & Joy VHS
494680,AO3E3KUHAQVT0,B000006J0K,"Ray Drury ""Dru""","[1, 1]","Comfort and Joy is an underrated gem of a Christmas movie. Bill Paterson plays Alan ""Dickie"" Bird, a popular radio personality experiencing a mid-life crisis sparked by his girlfriend's unexpected departure (a marvelously written and realized scene). Feeling rather superficial, underused and overqualified professionally, Alan embarks on a journey of self-realization, culminating in his brokering a deal between two bickering ice cream truck families embroiled in a turf-war (what?). This gentle and charming film demonstrates writer/director Forsyth's penchant for quirky, subtle humour and for stories possessing much more meaning than one would realize upon first glance. Some favorite scenes (besides the aforementioned ""break-up"") include Alan's numerous tapings of radio commercials, the ""Godfatheresque"" meeting between Alan and the patriarch of one of the feuding ice cream families, and an appointment with a therapist in dire need of therapy himself. A wonderful film, rivaling many of Forsyth's more well-known efforts, including Local Hero and Gregory's Girl. Purchase Comfort and Joy (hopefully released on DVD region 1 soon, as that is my only reason for witholding the coveted 5th star) for your Christmas film library.

494681,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000006J0K,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[30, 30]","Comfort and Joy (Bill Forsyth, 1984)It's kind of hard to describe the appeal of Bill Forsyth's fourth (yes, there was one before Gregory's Girl) feature film, Comfort and Joy, without sounding like a raving lunatic. Not that that's ever stopped me before. A popular radio DJ, Alan 'Dickie' Byrd (Bill Paterson [Foyle's War, Truly Madly Deeply]), has his girlfriend Maddy (Eleanor David [White Hunter Black Heart, he Wolves of Willoughby Chase]) move out on him a few days before Christmas. While trying to get over it, he spies a gorgeous woman in an ice cream truck and, on a whim, pursues her, and it, to the outskirts of town, where it's attacked by a band of masked robbers. One of them recognizes Alan, which gets him involved in a turf war between the rival ice cream vendors Mr. McCool and Mr. Bunny. Which results, of course, in everyone around him thinking he's utterly mad.While it's not Forsyth's best work (that title is reserved for Housekeeping), Comfort and Joy is, well, a joy. Forsyth's use of visual tricks and sight gags makes for a wonderful experience, and as for the plot, well, what can be better than warring ice-cream factions? An overlooked gem that's begging for a DVD release. **** ",4,Horribly underrated.,1094515200,"09 7, 2004",2004,1210,"['Comfort', 'Joy', 'Bill', 'Forsyth', '1984', 'kind', 'hard', 'describe', 'appeal', 'Bill', 'Forsyth', 'fourth', 'yes', 'was', 'one', 'Gregory', 'Girl', 'feature', 'film', 'Comfort', 'Joy', 'sounding', 'raving', 'lunatic', 'Not', 'ever', 'stopped', 'popular', 'radio', 'DJ', 'Alan', ""'Dickie"", 'Byrd', 'Bill', 'Paterson', '[', 'Foyle', 'War', 'Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', ']', 'girlfriend', 'Maddy', 'Eleanor', 'David', '[', 'White', 'Hunter', 'Black', 'Heart', 'Willoughby', 'Chase', ']', 'move', 'out', 'few', 'days', 'Christmas', 'trying', 'get', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'whim', 'outskirts', 'town', 'where', 'attacked', 'band', 'masked', 'robbers', 'One', 'Alan', 'involved', 'turf', 'war', 'rival', 'ice', 'cream', 'vendors', 'Mr.', 'McCool', 'Mr.', 'Bunny', 'Which', 'results', 'course', 'everyone', 'thinking', 'utterly', 'mad.While', 'not', 'Forsyth', 'best', 'work', 'title', 'reserved', 'Housekeeping', 'Comfort', 'Joy', 'well', 'joy', 'Forsyth', 'use', 'visual', 'tricks', 'sight', 'gags', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'plot', 'well', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'warring', 'ice-cream', 'factions', 'overlooked', 'gem', 'begging', 'DVD', 'release', '****']",Comfort & Joy VHS
494682,AEEJKRPXS9J9X,B000006J0K,Scott Jackson,"[1, 1]","Wikipedia's summary of this movie is totally without any understanding of Glasgow or the background to the movie.  Here is the history: In the same way that the Chinese run laundries in  California the Italians run ice cream shops in Scotland.  The Italians came to Scotland in the 1800s and opened ice cream shops. It is said that they all came  from the same region of Italy which was suffering some economic depression at the time.  Their reputation for gelatos was probably the root cause of their success in this business in Scotland.  So now to the movie.  The movie has to do with a war between two ice cream companies, both Italian of course.  This war was meant to be a spoof on American gang war movies that featured mostly Italians.  Of course there are no killings in this movie which makes is a low scale spoof.  All in all the idea that Glasgow is the Scottish equivalent of Chicago is the joke that runs through the whole movie. Another movie with a link between Glasgow and Chicago is My American Cousins. This is also worth watching.",5,A Delightful Spoof,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,1050,"['Wikipedia', 'summary', 'movie', 'totally', 'understanding', 'Glasgow', 'background', 'movie', 'Here', 'history', 'same', 'way', 'Chinese', 'run', 'laundries', 'California', 'Italians', 'run', 'ice', 'cream', 'shops', 'Scotland', 'Italians', 'came', 'Scotland', '1800s', 'opened', 'ice', 'cream', 'shops', 'said', 'came', 'same', 'region', 'Italy', 'was', 'suffering', 'economic', 'depression', 'time', 'reputation', 'gelatos', 'was', 'probably', 'root', 'cause', 'success', 'business', 'Scotland', 'So', 'now', 'movie', 'movie', 'do', 'war', 'two', 'ice', 'cream', 'companies', 'Italian', 'course', 'war', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'spoof', 'American', 'gang', 'war', 'movies', 'featured', 'mostly', 'Italians', 'course', 'are', 'killings', 'movie', 'low', 'scale', 'spoof', 'idea', 'Glasgow', 'Scottish', 'equivalent', 'Chicago', 'joke', 'whole', 'movie', 'movie', 'link', 'Glasgow', 'Chicago', 'American', 'Cousins', 'also', 'worth', 'watching']",Comfort & Joy VHS
