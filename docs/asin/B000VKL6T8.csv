1102250,A2UQJK29MKIPGM,B000VKL6T8,Allen Bowers,"[3, 15]","First of all let's be clear on a couple of things:number 1 I don't hate this movie 'cause it's what some may refer to as a ""Chick Flick""(true I am a man but I don't even believe in the term ""Chick Flick"" anyway. And second I love Scarlett for her beauty,grace,sex appeal,(and let's face it she's one of the few actresses lately who's more than just a ""pretty face""). Now that being said the problem is that not only does this reprehensible piece of sh** TOTALLY SUCK but on top of that it's the worst movie she's been in since A Love Song For Bobby Long! I mean for starters there's that really corny opening using museum exhibits as completely confusing metaphors! Also there's that B.S. with her starting out referring most everybody by aliases to begin with(ie Mr. and Mrs.X and Harvard Hottie! How moronic is that!) And then at the end when you realize you don't even care anymore you find out the said characters ""real names""! Next the only character who's name you do get to know about right away is the kid's! And then of all the stupidest names they could give him his name is Grayer! What the f*** kind of a name is that! Grayer than what a cloudy sky, an old lady's hair,WHAT! HA HA LOL! Anyway the script was pure Dogsh** and the scene where Scarlett Johanssen and Alicia Keys are singing along with George Michael's Freedom was sheer embarrassment! Especially since a)I hate George Michael and b) When Scarlett was standing up while the car was moving and dancing while wearing sunglasses she looked ridiculous! Oh and that scene in some bar where all these guys are criticizing her for being a nanny she spouting one h*** of a corny line afterwards! And I hate Laura Linney and the fact that Alicia Keys had very little part in it!

Unfortunately, she fails to impress in this one, which may or may not be the fault of the script, but damn - she looks and acts vapid, brainless and clueless.Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Annie wants to be an anthropologist2. Her mom wants her to be a financier3. She ends up as a nanny4. As you may have already predicted, she learns that money doesn't buy happiness, love comes when you least expect it, and an assortment of other chick flick clich&eacute;s.5. Laura Linney gives the only performance worth your rental fee, while Paul Giamatti is still wondering what he was doing there in the first place.  Alicia Keys and Chris Evans also have small dumbed-down parts.6.

1102252,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000VKL6T8,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","There have been many comparisons made between this film and last years `The Devil Wears Prada' and I think that this comparison is an unfair one at that.  `The Devil Wears Prada' was a superior film, but that doesn't mean that `The Nanny Diaries' is a waste of time.  No, in fact `The Nanny Diaries' was a splendid little film that sported some fine performances (or one killer performance) and a nice little moral at the end that is nothing short of heartwarming.  Comparing this to `Devil' is a little harsh.  `Devil' received critical acclaim; it sported Meryl's star power not to mention her Oscar nominated performance (even if it was a bit unworthy) and it had that spicy Emily Blunt who just blew up from her scene stealing role.  `The Nanny Diaries', when in comparison, comes off a bit below par, but when taken on its own, separated from its predecessor, it suffices as a nice family film.The film follows Annie Braddock, a recent college graduate who decides that, in an attempt to discover who `Annie' really is, she is going to become a full time nanny.  Her employer, Mrs. X, is anything but sympathetic, warm or generous and becomes the focal point of the viewer's attention.  This has much to do with Laura Linney's marvelous performance, but I'll get to that in a moment.  Annie forms an attachment to the X's son Grayer, a hyper little boy who is suffering from lack of attention on the part of his self obsessed parents.  Mr. X is a piece of work (or you could substitute another word there instead of `work' if you get my drift) and his actions weigh heavy on the X family.  Annie is torn between telling her boss off and leaving or staying for Grayer's sake.Annie's bond with Grayer is sweet and sincere.  Scarlett Johansson (who has done much better than this) does a decent job of maneuvering her character from scene to scene.  I expected a little more depth from her, but what she did was really nothing to complain about.  Young Nicholas Reese Art was fantastic as Grayer, convincing and touching.  We believe him in every scene and understand his pain in losing his nannies.Donna Murphy has a few nice scenes, but nothing monumental.  She's barely used, which is a shame because in her few scenes she evokes a pure command of attention.  Alicia Keys and Paul Giamatti on the other hand are wasted.  Giamatti looks as if he's reprising his role from `Big Fat Liar' and Keys just doesn't have anything that makes us pay attention.  She takes on the `best friend/side kick' role and does it thanklessly as apposed to pulling a Cusack and making it shine brightly.This brings us to Linney who was so delicious here I'm pulling for a surprise Oscar nomination (it won't happen but it would be such a delight if it did).  Her performance as Mrs. X one-upped Streep's last year in that she brought a real sense of emotion to her character.  I loved Streep in `Devil' but never though of her performance as award worthy.  It was strong and commanding but never came off as human to me.  Laura Linney on the other hand came off as genuine in every frame.  We could see what was lying underneath that harsh exterior and we longed for her to be broken only so she could truly be healed.  I adored her performance immensely.The film may be a little generic at times but it's heartfelt and sweet.  It's a film that tries hard to deliver a message and actually delivers a very strong and moving message when all is said and done.  Sure, it could have been better, but honestly people, this movie is far from bad.",4,This diary deserves a read...,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,3525,"['have', 'been', 'many', 'comparisons', 'made', 'film', 'last', 'years', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'think', 'comparison', 'unfair', 'one', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'was', 'superior', 'film', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Nanny', 'Diaries', 'waste', 'time', 'No', 'fact', 'Nanny', 'Diaries', 'was', 'splendid', 'little', 'film', 'sported', 'fine', 'performances', 'one', 'killer', 'performance', 'nice', 'little', 'moral', 'end', 'nothing', 'short', 'heartwarming', 'Comparing', 'Devil', 'little', 'harsh', 'Devil', 'received', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'sported', 'Meryl', 'star', 'power', 'not', 'mention', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'even', 'was', 'bit', 'unworthy', 'had', 'spicy', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'who', 'just', 'blew', 'up', 'scene', 'stealing', 'role', 'Nanny', 'Diaries', 'when', 'comparison', 'off', 'bit', 'par', 'when', 'taken', 'own', 'separated', 'predecessor', 'nice', 'family', 'film.The', 'film', 'Annie', 'Braddock', 'recent', 'college', 'graduate', 'who', 'attempt', 'discover', 'who', 'Annie', 'really', 'going', 'become', 'full', 'time', 'nanny', 'employer', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'anything', 'sympathetic', 'warm', 'generous', 'focal', 'point', 'viewer', 'attention', 'much', 'do', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'marvelous', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'get', 'moment', 'Annie', 'attachment', 'X', 'son', 'Grayer', 'hyper', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'suffering', 'lack', 'attention', 'part', 'self', 'obsessed', 'parents', 'Mr.', 'X', 'piece', 'work', 'could', 'substitute', 'word', 'there', 'instead', 'work', 'get', 'drift', 'actions', 'weigh', 'heavy', 'X', 'family', 'Annie', 'torn', 'telling', 'boss', 'leaving', 'staying', 'Grayer', 'sake.Annie', 'bond', 'Grayer', 'sweet', 'sincere', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'decent', 'job', 'maneuvering', 'character', 'scene', 'scene', 'expected', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'really', 'nothing', 'complain', 'Young', 'Nicholas', 'Reese', 'Art', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Grayer', 'convincing', 'touching', 'believe', 'scene', 'understand', 'pain', 'losing', 'nannies.Donna', 'Murphy', 'few', 'nice', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'monumental', 'barely', 'used', 'shame', 'few', 'scenes', 'pure', 'command', 'attention', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'wasted', 'Giamatti', 'reprising', 'role', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'Keys', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'pay', 'attention', 'best', 'friend/side', 'kick', 'role', 'thanklessly', 'apposed', 'pulling', 'Cusack', 'making', 'shine', 'brightly.This', 'brings', 'Linney', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'delicious', 'here', ""'m"", 'pulling', 'surprise', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'would', 'be', 'such', 'delight', 'did', 'performance', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'one-upped', 'Streep', 'last', 'year', 'brought', 'real', 'sense', 'emotion', 'character', 'loved', 'Streep', 'Devil', 'never', 'performance', 'award', 'worthy', 'was', 'strong', 'commanding', 'never', 'came', 'off', 'human', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'other', 'hand', 'came', 'off', 'genuine', 'frame', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'lying', 'underneath', 'harsh', 'exterior', 'longed', 'be', 'broken', 'only', 'so', 'could', 'truly', 'be', 'healed', 'adored', 'performance', 'immensely.The', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'generic', 'times', 'heartfelt', 'sweet', 'film', 'hard', 'deliver', 'message', 'actually', 'very', 'strong', 'moving', 'message', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'Sure', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'honestly', 'people', 'movie', 'far', 'bad']",N/A

I like Scarlett Johansson and Laura Linney -they are good actresses and they can show depth in characters in other movies. So somehow I expect more from this movie. The lovely child, the affluent Manhattan, the handsome love interest and the nurse mother who wishes her daughter (Scarlett Johansson) to make the most out of her degree seems to be a promising start.However, something amisses. The actors and actresses are good but the characters don't seem real. It is difficult to imagine wealthy people will ignore their adorabale child's thirst for affection and immerse themselves completely in merger (for the father) and benefits (for the mother). The love interest seems unreal too. It can't be that his classmates are all insensitive jerks and he the only one who shows emphathy and respect for others.So the only real characters I can relate to are the nurse mother ( a caring and concerned mom) and Alicia Keys (gorgeous and witty). As for the leading lady, she makes the movie more watchable. But the story itself (I don't know about the book) makes the superficial wealthy people look so unbelievably ridiculous.

Blah blah blah.  It's the sort of the movie that's supposed to make us feel better about being working poor, among the hoi polloi, the Great Unwashed: hey, look! -- the rich are more miserable than us!  Let's laugh at their dysfunction!  Let's indulge in our working-class snobbery by enjoying how these potentates are unable to be good parents!  Unfortunately for the class warriors, it's likely that very wealthy people have at least as good a chance of being effective parents as working-class folks have of being neglectful or abusive parents.  There are plenty of reasons to despise the rich, but emotional assumptions about their parental skills won't bring on the Revolution, babe.  Oh well, at least the script has the decency to admit that a gorgeous Caucasian like Scarlett Johansson is about as common in the nanny trade as the moon entering eclipse.None of the above is particularly interesting.  What struck me while watching this freebie on Prime is the sexual tension between Laura Linney, the determinedly phony and seemingly frigid Park Avenue matriarch, and our Jersey Girl Johansson.  Perhaps both actors would deny this, but clearly both of them were bored, and it seems to me that they were playfully adding some subtext to a domestic situation that was not really in the script.  I think the writer inadvertently laid the groundwork for doomed passion between the two by having each woman be a bee in each other's bonnet -- they're rather obsessed with each other throughout the proceedings -- and, imo, Linney and Johansson ran with the idea.  Take note of the dominant/submissive posture between Linney and Johansson, respectively.  Each of them play it to the hilt, particularly Johansson, who cowers in dewy awe of Linney in almost every scene they're in together.  Beyond the actors' behavior, there are scenes like the one where Linney's asking Johansson to zip up a red-alert red dress.  Linney barges in on Johansson while she's in bed wearing a tank.  Such scenes are erotically charged, both &#34;in situ&#34; and as performed by the actors, and lead me to consider that the writers were in on the joke after all -- it's kind of hard to tell, given the mainly commercial agenda of the movie.  And of course the Crisis (as they call it in screenwriting manuals) involves an indiscretion (poorly staged and written) between hubby Paul Giamatti and Johansson.  Watch Linney carefully during the confrontation with Johansson -- the jealousy about the younger woman's boyfriend is palpable.  &#34;I wasn't born YESTERDAY!&#34;  The actors dutifully go about pursuing their &#34;official&#34; motivations, but the intensity between the women is &#34;outside the script&#34;.But hey, maybe I'm just wishfully thinking.Anyway, the other thing that caught my attention was Donna Murphy's ambitions for her daughter Johansson, which struck me as about 20 years past its sell-by date.  Murphy's a working-class nurse, and as far as she's concerned, if her daughter isn't a CFO of a major corporation, wearing skirt-suits with shoulder pads the width of a Spanish galleon, then Johansson will have wasted Murphy's time and indeed will have let down women the world over.  In 2007, when this movie was released, (almost) all careers were, and still are, open to women -- if Johansson wants to be an anthropologist rather than a corporate hack, then what the hell's the problem?  The movie can't decide if it wants to mock the wealthy into submission or have its working-class heroines merely supplant the existing order.

Directed and written by the husband-wife team of Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini (who previously partnered on the smart and quirkyAmerican Splendorabout underground comic book writer Harvey Pekar), this movie would seem ripe for a sharp satire about the privileged class on the Upper East Side. However, the trite life-lessons orientation of this modern-day fairy tale escapes their idiosyncratic grasp, and the result is a superficial slog with a particularly narcissistic perspective.The story centers on New Jersey-bred Annie Braddock, freshly graduated with honors from NYU, who realizes during a corporate interview that she doesn't know what she wants to do with her life. As an anthropology major, she sees life as a series of Museum of Natural History dioramas (a particularly contrived device used repeatedly in the film). By happenstance in Central Park, she is recruited to become a nanny for the unfortunately named Grayer, the towheaded son of a glamorous, designer-clothed society matron referred to as Mrs. X. The trappings are luxurious at Mrs. X's apartment, but things go sour almost immediately when Mrs. X's demands on Annie become excessive. It turns out that the Mrs. X is in a bad marriage which has left the Mrs. desperate for her workaholic husband's attentions while ignoring her son. As this personal drama unfolds, Grayer becomes attached to Annie, and she responds in kind, which of course, can only lead to complications.As much as I like Scarlett Johansson, she is not a natural at this type of character-driven comedy (unless you count the skits she does onSaturday Night Livewhere she plays Lexie, the glammed-up Jersey girl pointing repeatedly to chandeliers and marble columns). She just isn't that credible as a dowdy, nave post-graduate perhaps because she has already been seen in past films as a savvy and often world-weary bombshell. Her physical antics here seem especially strained and her tirades rather forced. It's not a bad performance as much as it is a misuse of her talent. Faring somewhat better is the always reliable Laura Linney, who gets to look gorgeous for a change and then uncover a wickedly vituperative woman rattled by her deep-seeded insecurity. The relationship between the two characters will likely remind you ofThe Devil Wears Prada, a much better adaptation of a lightweight roman-a-clef, although Mrs. X is not as complex or intimidating a character as fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly.Relegated to the sidelines is Paul Giamatti properly villainous as Mr. X, an adulterous, insensitive lout of a husband and father. Chris Evans colorlessly plays Harvard Hottie, Annie's preppy, kind-hearted suitor upstairs, while Nicholas Art simply doesn't register any real warmth as Grayer. Broadway great Donna Murphy shows up effectively as Annie's working-nurse mother, Julie White has a few funny moments as an unctuous training seminar leader, and pop singer Alicia Keys plays the requisite best pal role with bohemian spunk. The story's resolution feels particularly pat. The 2007 DVD has a few extras - no commentary track but a standard making-of featurette about 17 minutes long. The second short, ""Confessions from the Original Nannies: The Authors of the Bestselling Book"", is marginally more interesting as the book's co-authors Kraus and McLaughlin discuss their own experiences as nannies and the book-to-movie transformation. Lastly, there is an amazingly dull blooper reel plus the original theatrical trailer.",2,Superficial Life Lessons Eked Out of a Trivial Urban Fairy Tale,1199491200,"01 5, 2008",2008,3728,"['disheartening', 'see', 'such', 'sparkling', 'cast', 'put', 'motions', 'tiresome', 'mainstream', 'trifle', '2007', 'adaptation', 'lightweightbestseller', 'same', 'nameby', 'one-time', 'nannies', 'Emma', 'McLaughlin', 'Nicola', 'Kraus', 'Directed', 'written', 'husband-wife', 'team', 'Shari', 'Springer', 'Berman', 'Robert', 'Pulcini', 'who', 'previously', 'partnered', 'smart', 'quirkyAmerican', 'Splendorabout', 'comic', 'book', 'writer', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'movie', 'would', 'seem', 'ripe', 'sharp', 'satire', 'privileged', 'class', 'Upper', 'East', 'Side', 'However', 'trite', 'life-lessons', 'orientation', 'modern-day', 'fairy', 'tale', 'escapes', 'idiosyncratic', 'grasp', 'result', 'superficial', 'slog', 'particularly', 'narcissistic', 'perspective.The', 'story', 'centers', 'New', 'Jersey-bred', 'Annie', 'Braddock', 'freshly', 'graduated', 'honors', 'NYU', 'who', 'corporate', 'interview', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'anthropology', 'major', 'life', 'series', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'dioramas', 'particularly', 'contrived', 'device', 'used', 'repeatedly', 'film', 'happenstance', 'Central', 'Park', 'recruited', 'become', 'nanny', 'unfortunately', 'named', 'Grayer', 'towheaded', 'son', 'glamorous', 'designer-clothed', 'society', 'matron', 'referred', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'trappings', 'are', 'luxurious', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'apartment', 'things', 'go', 'sour', 'almost', 'immediately', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'demands', 'Annie', 'become', 'excessive', 'out', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'bad', 'marriage', 'left', 'Mrs.', 'desperate', 'workaholic', 'husband', 'attentions', 'ignoring', 'son', 'personal', 'drama', 'unfolds', 'Grayer', 'attached', 'Annie', 'kind', 'course', 'can', 'only', 'lead', 'complications.As', 'much', 'like', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'not', 'natural', 'type', 'character-driven', 'comedy', 'count', 'skits', 'onSaturday', 'Night', 'Livewhere', 'Lexie', 'glammed-up', 'Jersey', 'girl', 'pointing', 'repeatedly', 'chandeliers', 'marble', 'columns', 'just', ""n't"", 'that', 'credible', 'dowdy', 'nave', 'post-graduate', 'perhaps', 'already', 'been', 'seen', 'past', 'films', 'savvy', 'often', 'world-weary', 'bombshell', 'physical', 'antics', 'here', 'seem', 'especially', 'strained', 'tirades', 'rather', 'forced', 'not', 'bad', 'performance', 'as', 'much', 'misuse', 'talent', 'Faring', 'somewhat', 'better', 'always', 'reliable', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'look', 'gorgeous', 'change', 'then', 'uncover', 'wickedly', 'vituperative', 'woman', 'rattled', 'deep-seeded', 'insecurity', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'will', 'likely', 'remind', 'ofThe', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'much', 'better', 'adaptation', 'lightweight', 'roman-a-clef', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'not', 'complex', 'intimidating', 'character', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'editor', 'Miranda', 'Priestly.Relegated', 'sidelines', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'properly', 'villainous', 'Mr.', 'X', 'adulterous', 'insensitive', 'lout', 'husband', 'father', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'colorlessly', 'Harvard', 'Hottie', 'Annie', 'preppy', 'kind-hearted', 'suitor', 'upstairs', 'Nicholas', 'Art', 'simply', ""n't"", 'register', 'real', 'warmth', 'Grayer', 'Broadway', 'great', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'up', 'effectively', 'Annie', 'working-nurse', 'mother', 'Julie', 'White', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'unctuous', 'training', 'seminar', 'leader', 'pop', 'singer', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'requisite', 'best', 'pal', 'role', 'bohemian', 'spunk', 'story', 'resolution', 'feels', 'particularly', 'pat', '2007', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'commentary', 'track', 'standard', 'making-of', 'featurette', '17', 'minutes', 'long', 'second', 'short', 'Confessions', 'Original', 'Nannies', 'Authors', 'Bestselling', 'Book', 'marginally', 'more', 'interesting', 'book', 'co-authors', 'Kraus', 'McLaughlin', 'discuss', 'own', 'experiences', 'nannies', 'book-to-movie', 'transformation', 'Lastly', 'amazingly', 'dull', 'blooper', 'reel', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

Too bad it wasn't as killer as it could have been.""The Nanny Diaries"" is the screen adaptation of the bestselling book of the same name.  Scarlett Johansson plays Annie, a recent college graduate who is trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life.  During a job interview, she is thrown by the question, ""Who is Annie?"" and realizes that she doesn't really know.  A chance meeting with a rich Manhattan stay-at-home mom (Laura Linney) and her young son propels Annie into a new career - nanny (and incidental servant) to the ""X"" family.  Hilarity ensues as Annie tries to balance her new job and an extremely demanding boss with a having a life and finding out who she really is.I wanted to like this movie, I really did.  But in many ways it kind of felt like a watered-down version of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" - young 20-something trying to make her way in NYC, with a boss from hell and impossible situations.  However, ""The Nanny Diaries"" lacked the same bite that ""The Devil Wears Prada"" did.  I think the movie could have worked, despite that, except for one problem - the leading lady.  After seeing Scarlett Johansson in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and now in ""The Nanny Diaries,"" I'm beginning to think she has only one expression - wide-eyed deer in the headlights.  Johansson's performance is lackluster and she seems to be a little too mellow in spite of the craziness she's constantly finding herself in.  The only time she really lets loose with any emotion is when she's talking to the nanny cam near the end of the movie, and even then, she's not that expressive.The movie also fails to develop Annie's relationship with the Harvard Hottie.  He just seems to see her in these embarrassing moments, and suddenly wants to date her, even after she mouths off to all his friends.  Since he's one of the only saving graces to her job, it would have been nice if the Harvard guy had some depth to his character.That said, Laura Linney is great as Mrs. X, making her seem like a person you'd want to avoid and feel sorry for at the same time.  The anthropological visual tie-in with the displays at the Museum of Natural History are also cleverly executed.  But while Annie is obviously pursuing something in the anthropology field, by movie's end we're still not sure what she wants to do - or if she can answer the question, ""Who are you?""Since she can't answer that, and the movie can't answer that either, I'd recommend just getting this from your local library if you're absolutely dying to see it.

Is there any hope for the human race with parents as incompetent as this? To the film's credit, it attempts to elevate the ""mother"" to the position of a caring person. After all, she now can eat peanut butter and jelly directly from the jar -- what a woman!! But it's all too little too late. The sight of the crying, abandoned child and the heartless, cold ""father"" dumping his son's puppy on the departing nanny was enough to depress me for weeks.This story was bad enough when I read it.

It was based on the experiences of its two authors who served as nannies for some very wealthy New York clients.  The book introduced readers to a culture which, as the film suggests, is very foreign to middle-class people.  It demonstrated the fact that many wealthy people are not interested in raising children, they are interested in getting them into the ""right"" school, and socializing with the ""right"" people.  The fathers are involved in their work and the mothers are involved in themselves, which means that the children are pawned off on nannies and ignored.  The movie gets the point across, but some of the best moments in the book are left out.  There is a wonderful section in the book which describes a typical nanny Christmas in which the nanny shops for expensive gifts for her employers' staff, friends, and family, and then she herself receives only a pair of earmuffs as a gift.

Nanny Diaries includes a hint of Mary Poppins along with a museum-type look at family norms and not so norms throughout the movie. This film has elements of terrible sadness and that is why my daughter didn't like it. The viewer gets to see the inside of a very unhealthy family. Annie (Johannson) doesn't come from much healthier stock with a mom who is over-bearing and hard to please and a father who is a non-figure in her life.Annie hits her crossroad moment when a potential new employer asks her who she is. Annie discovers who she is by her short time as a nanny.I was impressed with the total lack of on-screen sexuality. Annie has a behind closed doors moment with a kissing scene leading up to it and Mr. X is in two compromising situations that mostly play out off camera. One or two F-Bombs and a smattering of the usual curse words give it the PG-13.I was pleased with the ending and overall really liked this film.

""The Nanny Diaries"" stars Scarlett Johansson as Annie, a recent college grad who decides to postpone her impending business career and takes a job as a nanny for Grayer, a young boy who lives on the Upper East Side in New York City. Annie quickly discovers that her new life as ""Nanny"" isn't all it's cracked up to be. Grayer's father, Mr. X (Paul Giamatti),  is an adulterous workaholic who's never at home, and Mrs. X (Laura Linney) is a completely hands-off mom who is also the Employer from Hell. Even though she desperately wants to quit her job, Annie decides to stick it out because she can't bear to leave poor little Grayer alone with his crazy inattentive parents.Overall, I enjoyed this film. It wasn't quite as funny as the book, but the cast is excellent, especially Johansson and Linney. This is one of those rare instances where a lot of elements from the book were changed for the big screen adaptation, and most of the changes didn't bother me all that much (having Annie live with the X's, Mr. X making a pass at Annie, etc.). The ending of the movie is different from the book, in that Mrs. X actually manages to grow a heart at the end of the film, which SO does not happen in the novel! I prefer the way the book gave an honest depiction of the fact that there are a lot of horrible parents in the world who will just never change, but I'm sure the Hollywood types prefer a happy ending whenever possible, and that's what they gave this film. As a standalone movie, I think the ending was perfectly fine...I just like the book version better, that's all.In spite of a few minor flaws, ""The Nanny Diaries"" really delivers.

Hoping to get some downtime and get her head together, Annie takes a job as a nanny with ""Mr. and Mrs. X"" for their son Greyer.Mr. and Mrs. X, as you might guess, are appalling people (think the Real Housewives of Orange County) who mistreat their son and are far more concerned about image than reality.  Annie, who grows to love and pity Greyer, finds that she's become his sole emotional support, and so puts up with all the abuse Mrs. X dishes out, as well as the creepy advances of Mr. X (who is a lecher, though Mrs. X is desperately in denial) in order to support him.All of this was very poignant and realistic.  However, it seems like the filmmakers wanted to make a feel good movie, and the above is not feel-good material.  Thus, a plastic romantic interest and an ending where everyone learns their lesson is added in to assure the audience that it's all in good fun.  I was left very skeptical of how quickly various characters came to momentous decisions.Still, Nanny Diaries is a movie with a lot going for it.  The acting is wonderful throughout, with Mr. and Mrs. X (played by Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney) in particular giving very vivid performances.  There are also a few cute and funny scenes scattered inbetween the depressing bits of Mrs. X being a shrew and Mr. X cheating.Nanny Diaries is a movie worth seeing, but don't be surprised if the ending makes you feel a bit blindsided.",3,Feel-good movie.,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,1557,"['basic', 'story', 'Annie', 'recently', 'graduated', 'Anthropology', 'student', 'panics', 'pressure', 'mother', 'putting', 'become', 'businesswoman', 'Hoping', 'get', 'downtime', 'get', 'head', 'together', 'Annie', 'job', 'nanny', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'son', 'Greyer.Mr', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'might', 'guess', 'are', 'appalling', 'people', 'think', 'Real', 'Housewives', 'Orange', 'County', 'who', 'mistreat', 'son', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'concerned', 'image', 'reality', 'Annie', 'who', 'love', 'pity', 'Greyer', 'become', 'sole', 'emotional', 'support', 'so', 'up', 'abuse', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'creepy', 'advances', 'Mr.', 'X', 'who', 'lecher', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'desperately', 'denial', 'order', 'support', 'him.All', 'was', 'very', 'poignant', 'realistic', 'However', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'above', 'not', 'feel-good', 'material', 'Thus', 'plastic', 'romantic', 'interest', 'ending', 'where', 'everyone', 'lesson', 'added', 'assure', 'audience', 'good', 'fun', 'was', 'left', 'very', 'skeptical', 'how', 'quickly', 'various', 'characters', 'came', 'momentous', 'decisions.Still', 'Nanny', 'Diaries', 'movie', 'lot', 'going', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'played', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'particular', 'giving', 'very', 'vivid', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'cute', 'funny', 'scenes', 'scattered', 'depressing', 'bits', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'being', 'shrew', 'Mr.', 'X', 'cheating.Nanny', 'Diaries', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'ending', 'feel', 'bit', 'blindsided']",N/A

Beyond trafficking in just about every stereotype and clich&eacute; imaginable - the heartless, neurotic, slave-driving elitists; the sensitive knight-in-shining armor love interest (Chris Evans); the nagging, free-living best friend; the lecherous, nanny-chasing husband (Paul Giamatti) - the movie is woefully unsuccessful even at treading that fine line between cleverness and cuteness that can make or break a film of this type.  There is an affectionate tribute to ""Mary Poppins"" that - early on at least - suggests that the movie might actually try to do something a little daring, a little different.  But that air of fanciful creativity is quickly squelched in favor of formulaic storytelling and cookie cutter characterizations.Interestingly, the filmmakers, for all their championing of the women employed as nannies, seem to have almost as low an opinion of the profession itself as do the elite snobs who appear on screen.All told, Johansson is really the only decent thing about ""The Nanny Diaries"" (well, little Nicholas Art is pretty cool too), but even her staunchest admirers would be well advised to look the other way when it comes to this film.",2,cookie-cutter comedy,1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,1762,"['**1/2Recent', 'college', 'grad', 'Annie', 'Braddock', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'set', 'career', 'business', 'when', 'quite', 'literally', 'position', 'nanny', 'four-year-old', 'son', 'Nicholas', 'Art', 'snooty', 'self-absorbed', 'Upper', 'East', 'Side', 'socialite', 'named', 'Alexandra', 'X', 'played', 'sadly', 'miscast', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'many', 'movie', 's', 'wearisomely', 'cutesy', 'touches', 'not', 'giving', 'surname', 'family', '.Based', 'novel', 'Emma', 'McLaughlin', 'Nicola', 'Kraus', 'Nanny', 'Diaries', 'unfortunately', 'bit', 'predictable', 'trite', 'simpleminded', 'premise', 'would', 'lead', 'one', 'expect', 'Beyond', 'trafficking', 'just', 'stereotype', 'clich', 'eacute', 'imaginable', 'heartless', 'neurotic', 'slave-driving', 'elitists', 'sensitive', 'knight-in-shining', 'armor', 'love', 'interest', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'nagging', 'free-living', 'best', 'friend', 'lecherous', 'nanny-chasing', 'husband', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'movie', 'woefully', 'unsuccessful', 'even', 'treading', 'fine', 'line', 'cleverness', 'cuteness', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'film', 'type', 'affectionate', 'tribute', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'early', 'least', 'movie', 'might', 'actually', 'try', 'do', 'something', 'little', 'daring', 'little', 'different', 'air', 'fanciful', 'creativity', 'quickly', 'squelched', 'favor', 'formulaic', 'storytelling', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'characterizations.Interestingly', 'filmmakers', 'championing', 'women', 'employed', 'nannies', 'seem', 'have', 'almost', 'low', 'opinion', 'profession', 'do', 'elite', 'snobs', 'who', 'appear', 'screen.All', 'told', 'Johansson', 'really', 'only', 'decent', 'thing', 'Nanny', 'Diaries', 'well', 'little', 'Nicholas', 'Art', 'pretty', 'cool', 'too', 'even', 'staunchest', 'admirers', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'advised', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'when', 'film']",N/A

1102351,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000VKL6T8,Terry Mesnard,"[20, 27]","The Nanny Diaries fits into the same category as The Devil Wears Prada.  Both feature women who take a plunge into a society that's not prepared for them and, more importantly, they aren't prepared for.  In the Devil Wears Prada, the target is fashion.  Here, the target is more broad: upper class Manhattanites with no time for their families.The movie owes even more to The Devil Wears Prada (including a brief snippet that features the main character reading the novel in a wink-wink, nudge-nudge homage) and contains, unfortunately, none of the spark and cutting edge that the former had.  Here we have the always beautiful  Scarlett Johansson as an Anthropology student named Annie who is uncertain about her future and what she wants to be in the real world.  Instead of facing the future, she stumbles upon Mrs. X (played with icy chill by Laura Linney) who mistakes her name Annie as ""nanny"" and immediately the park seems crowded with Manhattanites who want her services.Long story short, she gets the job and, like a certain fashionista, discovers she bit off more than she can chew.  Along the route, she meets the ""Harvard Hottie"" (Chris Evans) and the lecherous and incredibly creepy Mr. X (played by Paul Giamatti in a role very unlike his others) and learns about love, life and the importance of ""following your dreams""(tm).While the story is humorous in parts and I really enjoyed the framing as an anthropology experiment where it's Annie looking from the outside in and learning about this absolutely foreign culture, it suffers from pacing problems.  The beginning was amusing and fun and so was the ending.  How they got there, though, was not worth the time.  Director Shari Springer Berman worked magic in her adaptation of American Splendor (also featuring Paul Giamatti), but none of that spark is found here.I will say it has a great cast.  Paul Giamatti is terrific as is Laura Linney, who I've always enjoyed.  Even Chris Evans who has come a long way from his roots in Not Another Teen Movie is enjoyable.  This strong cast led by the always pretty Scarlett Johansson really helps the movie and carry the film.  Unfortunately, their parts don't truly resonate the way they should.  I think this is what separates this movie from The Devil Wears Prada.  Whereas the characters in Prada felt real and carried a spark, here they merely feel like caricatures.There's some really cute and good scenes, but overall it's too little too late, especially when faced with the tremendously better The Devil Wears Prada of last year.  I'd recommend waiting for a renter.Cute, for what it is.",3,Not half as good as it wants you to think it is,1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,2608,"['Nanny', 'Diaries', 'same', 'category', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'feature', 'women', 'who', 'take', 'plunge', 'society', 'not', 'prepared', 'more', 'importantly', 'are', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'target', 'fashion', 'Here', 'target', 'more', 'broad', 'upper', 'class', 'Manhattanites', 'time', 'families.The', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'including', 'brief', 'snippet', 'main', 'character', 'reading', 'novel', 'wink-wink', 'nudge-nudge', 'homage', 'unfortunately', 'none', 'spark', 'cutting', 'edge', 'former', 'had', 'Here', 'have', 'always', 'beautiful', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Anthropology', 'student', 'named', 'Annie', 'who', 'uncertain', 'future', 'what', 'be', 'real', 'world', 'Instead', 'facing', 'future', 'Mrs.', 'X', 'played', 'icy', 'chill', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'name', 'Annie', 'nanny', 'immediately', 'park', 'crowded', 'Manhattanites', 'who', 'want', 'services.Long', 'story', 'short', 'job', 'certain', 'fashionista', 'bit', 'off', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'route', 'Harvard', 'Hottie', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'lecherous', 'incredibly', 'creepy', 'Mr.', 'X', 'played', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'role', 'very', 'others', 'about', 'love', 'life', 'importance', 'following', 'dreams', 'tm', 'story', 'humorous', 'parts', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'framing', 'anthropology', 'experiment', 'where', 'Annie', 'looking', 'outside', 'learning', 'absolutely', 'foreign', 'culture', 'pacing', 'problems', 'beginning', 'was', 'amusing', 'fun', 'so', 'was', 'ending', 'How', 'got', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'time', 'Director', 'Shari', 'Springer', 'Berman', 'worked', 'magic', 'adaptation', 'American', 'Splendor', 'also', 'featuring', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'none', 'spark', 'found', 'here.I', 'will', 'say', 'great', 'cast', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'terrific', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Even', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'who', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'roots', 'Not', 'Teen', 'Movie', 'enjoyable', 'strong', 'cast', 'led', 'always', 'pretty', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'really', 'movie', 'carry', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'truly', 'resonate', 'way', 'should', 'think', 'what', 'movie', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'characters', 'Prada', 'felt', 'real', 'carried', 'spark', 'here', 'merely', 'feel', 'caricatures.There', 'really', 'cute', 'good', 'scenes', 'overall', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'especially', 'when', 'faced', 'tremendously', 'better', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'last', 'year', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'waiting', 'renter.Cute', 'what']",N/A
