901989,A1YCDZ4K4G0CN3,B00095L94W,David Carlin,"[19, 19]","I enjoyed this documentary.  I've read a few of the other reviews and I guess I am confused as to what some of these viewers expected.  This is not an engineering documentary on Moog synthesizers in any regard, What we have here is a very good overview of the Man himself.  Bob Moog comes across as a very easy-natured person who was initially very interested in electrical engineering but was luckily diverted into musical audio technology.  In this video you can see him interacting with musicians and learning how they use his instruments.  He learned not just the electrical side but the artistic side of the musicians he listened to when developing ideas.  This was constant.  I am currently reading a very good documentary on Moog and this video complements it very well.  Since Moogs Passing in August of 2005, this video will shed much light on his character and his life interests.  Bob never gave the impression he wanted to be rich from the fruit of his labors, but wanted to stay inquisitive to all aspects of his life.- Dave Carlin",5,Great Overview and Insite into Moogs Private world.,1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,1044,"['enjoyed', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'read', 'few', 'other', 'reviews', 'guess', 'am', 'confused', 'what', 'viewers', 'expected', 'not', 'engineering', 'documentary', 'Moog', 'synthesizers', 'regard', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'overview', 'Man', 'Bob', 'Moog', 'across', 'very', 'easy-natured', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'initially', 'very', 'interested', 'electrical', 'engineering', 'was', 'luckily', 'diverted', 'musical', 'audio', 'technology', 'video', 'can', 'see', 'interacting', 'musicians', 'learning', 'how', 'use', 'instruments', 'learned', 'not', 'just', 'electrical', 'side', 'artistic', 'side', 'musicians', 'listened', 'when', 'developing', 'ideas', 'was', 'constant', 'am', 'currently', 'reading', 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'Moog', 'video', 'very', 'well', 'Moogs', 'Passing', 'August', '2005', 'video', 'will', 'shed', 'much', 'light', 'character', 'life', 'interests', 'Bob', 'never', 'gave', 'impression', 'wanted', 'be', 'rich', 'fruit', 'labors', 'wanted', 'stay', 'inquisitive', 'aspects', 'life.-', 'Dave', 'Carlin']",Moog

Alas, this premise goes awry from the outset.  This mishmash of a documentary feels like a collection of outtakes from a better work.  I don't need to see Robert Moog talking about pepper plants and Money Mark diddling around on a synthesizer.MOOG demonstrates that sometimes it's best to not rely on the subject of the documentary as the subject matter expert of the film.  Robert Moog is not the most well-spoken advocate and historian of his life's work.  Likewise, showing the electronic guts of his machines doesn't do much to explain how they work or why Moog's work is important to the music world.When utilizing archive footage, MOOG works.  Unfortunately, these moments are few and far between leaving MOOG a mumbling, muttering mess for its interminable seventy-two minutes.  Moog and electronica deserve better.",2,"mumbling, muttering mess",1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,937,"['documentary', 'Robert', 'Moog', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'figures', 'electronic', 'music', 'Yes', 'please', 'sign', 'up', 'Alas', 'premise', 'awry', 'outset', 'mishmash', 'documentary', 'feels', 'collection', 'outtakes', 'better', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'Robert', 'Moog', 'talking', 'pepper', 'plants', 'Money', 'Mark', 'diddling', 'around', 'synthesizer.MOOG', 'best', 'not', 'rely', 'subject', 'documentary', 'subject', 'matter', 'expert', 'film', 'Robert', 'Moog', 'not', 'most', 'well-spoken', 'advocate', 'historian', 'life', 'work', 'Likewise', 'showing', 'electronic', 'guts', 'machines', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'explain', 'how', 'work', 'why', 'Moog', 'work', 'important', 'music', 'world.When', 'utilizing', 'archive', 'footage', 'MOOG', 'Unfortunately', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'leaving', 'MOOG', 'mumbling', 'muttering', 'mess', 'interminable', 'seventy-two', 'minutes', 'Moog', 'electronica', 'deserve', 'better']",Moog
901991,A1VP2TWZD6KSFC,B00095L94W,Mike Virgil,"[0, 0]","Well worth the time spent on watching it.You can see how this man was able to change the face of all music genre from electronic to hip-hip to prog rock by thinking outside the box. You can also see the parallels between how Robert Moog thought and how a modern dj thinks.It also reveals that no matter what age you are in humanity in general tends to react to change the same way. Skepticism and fear on the instrument abounded, until something triggers the change and then it becomes broadly accepted if the right conditions are given. Now we hear those kind of sounds every day.Very good jokes by Rick Wakeman.I was a little bit let down they didn't credit Jordan Rudess who's in the back playing with Rick Wakeman at what probably was Moogfest.What Robert Moog says at the end is the most important thing and I think is what motivates musicians to be on stage on the first place.",5,Satisfactory documentary,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,883,"['Well', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'it.You', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'man', 'was', 'able', 'change', 'face', 'music', 'genre', 'electronic', 'hip-hip', 'prog', 'rock', 'thinking', 'box', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'parallels', 'how', 'Robert', 'Moog', 'thought', 'how', 'modern', 'dj', 'thinks.It', 'also', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'are', 'humanity', 'general', 'tends', 'react', 'change', 'same', 'way', 'Skepticism', 'fear', 'instrument', 'abounded', 'something', 'triggers', 'change', 'then', 'broadly', 'accepted', 'right', 'conditions', 'are', 'given', 'Now', 'hear', 'kind', 'sounds', 'day.Very', 'good', 'jokes', 'Rick', 'Wakeman.I', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'let', 'did', ""n't"", 'credit', 'Jordan', 'Rudess', 'who', 'back', 'playing', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'what', 'probably', 'was', 'Moogfest.What', 'Robert', 'Moog', 'end', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'think', 'what', 'musicians', 'be', 'stage', 'first', 'place']",Moog

I did go to his memorial service... a little late, I admit. But this DVD gives so much insight into the realm of the synth. There's a fair amount of footage from the 50th anniversary event ""Moogfest"" at BB King's in NYC, in May of 2004. I attended that show, and was just one table from the stage, right in front of Keith Emerson and his monster-moog. There is also some segments of Bob and Rick Wakeman back stage (It was Rick Wakeman's birthday).Anyway- good stuff... I would buy it if I were you.

Mr. Fjellestad was working on an extremely limited budget, so how much can you complain when it's clear nobody else was willing to share his dream, or at least help pay for it.
