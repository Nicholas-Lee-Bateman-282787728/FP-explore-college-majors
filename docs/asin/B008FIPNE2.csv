I still have all of my books & some of the videos. I just remembered the story of the boy obsessed with strawberry ice cream and the dum-waiter fell on him and took off his head. Well yea that and 5 other episodes,ghost beach awesome ants and some others. Great if you remember the show and have kids and want to show em what you were into when you were a kid.

1551802,A1WVA7V02PQOY6,B008FIPNE2,Dad of Divas,"[1, 1]",This was a fun and spooky DVD. If you are a fan of the Goosebumps series (either in book format or the show) you will enjoy this. Each of the episodes will leave you looking over your shoulder (at least a bit) which for me is fun. Saying this though I may still say that this may not be appropriate for younger children as it could give them bad dreams. My oldest daughter and I watched these and she thoroughly enjoyed them and asked if we could watch them again which is always a good sign! All-in-all this was a great collection of shows that I would highly recommend!,5,A Spine Chilling DVD,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,571,"['was', 'fun', 'spooky', 'DVD', 'are', 'fan', 'Goosebumps', 'series', 'book', 'format', 'show', 'will', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'will', 'leave', 'looking', 'shoulder', 'least', 'bit', 'fun', 'Saying', 'may', 'still', 'say', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'children', 'could', 'give', 'bad', 'dreams', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'watched', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'asked', 'could', 'watch', 'again', 'always', 'good', 'sign', 'All-in-all', 'was', 'great', 'collection', 'shows', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
