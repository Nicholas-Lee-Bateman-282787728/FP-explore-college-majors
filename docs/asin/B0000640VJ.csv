Yes, it's intelligent, well-acted and witty.

From 'Dignan' in Bottle Rocket to 'Max Fischer' in Rushmore and now 'Royal Tenenbaum'.Gene Hackman is a great actor and has done many great performances though none have grabbed me like this. With such a cast it would be difficult for the most seasoned actor to stand out though this is exactly what Hackman does at every turn. This film belongs to Hackman and everyone else is just along for the ride.If you have read any of my reviews you will know I am not one to go into plot details but more into why I liked or loathed a film so much, so once again I will spare you the fodder.The Royal Tenenbaums is certainly not a film for everyone and the better for it. The characterization is only akin to The Simpsons as although these people can not be real they are oh so real. They have all the traits of people you know or have known and although they seem like parodies somehow they are not. You become totally engrossed with their lives and this is in no part due to the excellent narration as supplied by Alec Baldwin.The interaction between the actors is phenominal, truly recalling the interaction you have with your own family and acquaintences if not less cluttered. Like Rushmore before it Anderson's film has a deeply cynical streak and is defined as a very black comedy. The atmoshere reached throughout is all encombersing, so your desire to turn it off is either non existent or heightened. This is one of those films that leaves a lasting effect no matter what you thought of it, like the aftertaste of coffee.Fine print.Watch it.Love it or loath it.But you must see it!.I can not sway you any way so make up your own mind based on these above words.",5,...Dammit!

While the movie is definitely open to criticism, I find the family dynamics to be scarily reminiscent to my own--minus the adopted Margot thread. A film about my family is sure to have a limited audience, since most people don't care about the same things we care about. However, if you're willing to look about some of Anderson's randomness, the heart of his film is very powerful and had me laughing more than any other film of recent memory.",5,"Hillarious, Intelligent, Quirky",1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,578,"['Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'very', 'rare', 'film', 'perfect', 'blend', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'unique', 'style', 'best', 'talent', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'definitely', 'open', 'criticism', 'find', 'family', 'dynamics', 'be', 'scarily', 'reminiscent', 'own', 'adopted', 'Margot', 'thread', 'film', 'family', 'sure', 'have', 'limited', 'audience', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'same', 'things', 'care', 'However', ""'re"", 'willing', 'look', 'Anderson', 'randomness', 'heart', 'film', 'very', 'powerful', 'had', 'laughing', 'more', 'other', 'film', 'recent', 'memory']",The Royal Tenenbaums
697670,A371MODFVOA0QW,B0000640VJ,Abraham Brezo,"[3, 5]","I can even describe how much I enjoyed this movie. It has to beone of the best movies I have ever seen. It's safe to say I boughtthe DVD today when it was released. Not only is the movie sucha joy to watch, but the DVD was produced by The CriterionCollection, which means the presentation of the film will be veryspecial to view. Rushmore, Wes Anderson's prior film, was quiteincredible, but The Royal Tenenbaums is just so detailed andexquisite, that it kindly goes beyond Rushmore, and many people'sheads for that matter. I particularly enjoy the art on the cover of thisedition of the film. I believe that Anderson's brother created thedrawing, as well as other production sketches that are includedinside the DVD case. In fact, I love the cover, it has to be one ofthe best covers I've ever seen for a Criterion release. It showsRitchie as a young buy releasing his falcon Mordecai. You can seethe Tenenbaum Tower where Ritchie is standing. Now, if only I canfind a huge poster to hang in my room. Ebay here I come!What makes the film so great is the attention to detail. There is so much story to describe, that only bywatching the movie multiple times, will you be able to absorb every fabric that the feature has to offer.The supplemental material that comes with the DVD is fantastic, it describes every room in the houseto the slightest detail. The sketches were drawn before production began on the movie so Wes wouldhave more detail in which to show his crew.The Royal Tenenbaums is basically about a father attempting to reconcile with his family after manyyears of neglect and abuse. Now, why he's doing it, and how he will do this, is another story altogether.Let's see how much story I can cram in a paragraph. Ready? Here goes!Ok, Three siblings, one is adopted, Ritchie, Chas, and Margot. Ritchie is a Tennis superstar, Chas isa brilliant accountant, and Margot is a marvelous playwright. Simple right? Yeah right. Ritchie is in lovewith Margot (his adopted sister) which when the news of her marriage comes around, ruins hisperformance as a tennis player causing him to retire from the sport. Chas suffers a tragic loss when hiswife passes away in a tragic accident, and becomes paranoid with his two boys. Margot becomesbored in her marriage, and begins an affair with wannabe Tenenbaum Ejiah. Let's not forget about Mr.Tenenbaum himself, he's been living in a hotel room since his seperation (and impressionment) from hiswife. He's an estranged father and husband that needs to find a new home before he is permanetanlyremoved from his hotel room. And Mrs. Tenenbaum? Well, let's just say she doesn't miss her husbandtoo much.The film goes into detail of every child's past, displaying where the damage was done and by whom.Failure is a recurrent theme in the movie, as in all of Anderson's pictures. The detail in the storytellingis incredible, and I'd love to describe it all, but all I have to say is that you must watch this film, or own itif you can. Chas' dalmation mice are so adorable, and play a part of the plot, as does every aspect of themovie. Why did Royal shoot Chas with a BB gun? Why is Margot missing a finger? Why does Elijahwant to become a Tenenbaum so badly? What does the song Needle in the Hay mean? And why doesRitchie attempt suicide? These are questions, and many more questions, that can only be ansered bywatching this excellent movie. While you're at it, watch Rushmore too. The soundtrack for both filmsare great, and greatly enhance the film.Well, Amelie is being released next week, can't wait for that...",5,"Family isn't a word, it's a sentence....",1026172800,"07 9, 2002",2002,3558,"['can', 'even', 'describe', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'beone', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'safe', 'say', 'boughtthe', 'DVD', 'today', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'sucha', 'joy', 'watch', 'DVD', 'was', 'produced', 'CriterionCollection', 'presentation', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'veryspecial', 'view', 'Rushmore', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'prior', 'film', 'was', 'quiteincredible', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'just', 'so', 'detailed', 'andexquisite', 'kindly', 'Rushmore', 'many', ""people'sheads"", 'matter', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'art', 'cover', 'thisedition', 'film', 'believe', 'Anderson', 'brother', 'created', 'thedrawing', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'production', 'sketches', 'are', 'DVD', 'case', 'fact', 'love', 'cover', 'be', 'one', 'ofthe', 'best', 'covers', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Criterion', 'release', 'showsRitchie', 'young', 'buy', 'releasing', 'falcon', 'Mordecai', 'can', 'seethe', 'Tenenbaum', 'Tower', 'where', 'Ritchie', 'standing', 'Now', 'only', 'canfind', 'huge', 'poster', 'hang', 'room', 'Ebay', 'here', 'come', 'What', 'film', 'so', 'great', 'attention', 'detail', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'describe', 'only', 'bywatching', 'movie', 'multiple', 'times', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'absorb', 'fabric', 'feature', 'offer.The', 'supplemental', 'material', 'DVD', 'fantastic', 'room', 'houseto', 'slightest', 'detail', 'sketches', 'were', 'drawn', 'production', 'began', 'movie', 'so', 'Wes', 'wouldhave', 'more', 'detail', 'show', 'crew.The', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'basically', 'father', 'attempting', 'reconcile', 'family', 'manyyears', 'neglect', 'abuse', 'Now', 'why', 'doing', 'how', 'will', 'do', 'story', 'altogether.Let', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'can', 'cram', 'paragraph', 'Ready', 'Here', 'Ok', 'Three', 'siblings', 'one', 'adopted', 'Ritchie', 'Chas', 'Margot', 'Ritchie', 'Tennis', 'superstar', 'Chas', 'isa', 'brilliant', 'accountant', 'Margot', 'marvelous', 'playwright', 'Simple', 'right', 'Yeah', 'right', 'Ritchie', 'lovewith', 'Margot', 'adopted', 'sister', 'when', 'news', 'marriage', 'around', 'hisperformance', 'tennis', 'player', 'causing', 'retire', 'sport', 'Chas', 'tragic', 'loss', 'when', 'hiswife', 'away', 'tragic', 'accident', 'paranoid', 'two', 'boys', 'Margot', 'becomesbored', 'marriage', 'affair', 'wannabe', 'Tenenbaum', 'Ejiah', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'Mr.Tenenbaum', 'been', 'living', 'hotel', 'room', 'seperation', 'impressionment', 'hiswife', 'estranged', 'father', 'husband', 'find', 'new', 'home', 'permanetanlyremoved', 'hotel', 'room', 'Mrs.', 'Tenenbaum', 'Well', 'let', 'just', 'say', ""n't"", 'miss', 'husbandtoo', 'much.The', 'film', 'detail', 'child', 'past', 'displaying', 'where', 'damage', 'was', 'done', 'whom.Failure', 'recurrent', 'theme', 'movie', 'Anderson', 'pictures', 'detail', 'storytellingis', 'incredible', ""'d"", 'love', 'describe', 'have', 'say', 'must', 'watch', 'film', 'own', 'itif', 'can', 'Chas', 'dalmation', 'mice', 'are', 'so', 'adorable', 'play', 'part', 'plot', 'aspect', 'themovie', 'Why', 'did', 'Royal', 'shoot', 'Chas', 'BB', 'gun', 'Why', 'Margot', 'missing', 'finger', 'Why', 'Elijahwant', 'become', 'Tenenbaum', 'so', 'badly', 'What', 'song', 'Needle', 'Hay', 'mean', 'why', 'doesRitchie', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'are', 'questions', 'many', 'more', 'questions', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'ansered', 'bywatching', 'excellent', 'movie', ""'re"", 'watch', 'Rushmore', 'too', 'soundtrack', 'filmsare', 'great', 'greatly', 'enhance', 'film.Well', 'Amelie', 'being', 'released', 'next', 'week', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait']",The Royal Tenenbaums

It's a shame, because Rushmore is almost a perfect movie, charmingly demented and touching all at once.TRT lacks these virtues absolutely; it is a precious, gaseous zeppelin of bombast that sets the stage for greater crimes of self-indulgence to follow in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.  The Life Aquatic is recommended only to those who have not yet worked up the courage required for suicide.There is nothing remotely real about any of these characters; they even fail on a symbolic level.  The people of TRT have the depth and sensibility of Roz Chast cartoons, with none of the wit.  A truly brilliant cast is completely squandered in this love song to smugness.  Undiscriminating viewers are certain to confuse the presumption of hipness with content, an increasingly common mistake.Beware.  TRT has one purpose and one purpose alone.  It is not to make you laugh, or to make you feel.  It is not to thrill you with well-crafted drama that excites the imagination and prompts interest.  It certainly isn't to provide you with food for thought, much less food for your soul.

Now, for the people who do have a dark sense of humor: this is a must-see. I went to see it in the theaters a couple of weeks after it came out, and I immediately wanted to see it again! I found the whole movie to be so royally entertaining that I just couldn't see why anyone would dislike it. It has a great ensemble cast that includes Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bill Murray, Gene Hackman, Danny Glover, Anjelica Huston, and BOTH of the Wilson brothers - and everyone is at their best. There was not one bad performance throughout the whole movie. It is true: this is a VERY quirky film, and some of the characters' actions sometimes seem to make no sense (the scene near the end with Owen Wilson and his painted face...well, I still don't understand that one - and Bill Murray's young sidekick--who was he, and why was he always around?), but it is as charming and tragic as it is quirky. The standout in the whole movie, in my opinion, would have to be Gwyneth Paltrow, as the family's &quot;adopted daughter&quot; Margot. With her dark eyelined eyes and almost constant frown she plays the part perfectly, and it really makes you like her as an actress. So anyway, if you have an appreciation for a kind of humor other than slap-stick, then you definitely should check this one out. Some say it's boring, but I say it's a fine film with a fine cast.

697677,A2APWO4YN1CX18,B0000640VJ,"Amazon Customer ""beagle master""","[2, 10]","Rushmore was one of the most exciting films of its year.  As a fellow filmmaker, I reveled in Wes Anderson's virtuosity...his character and plot cues were precise and compelling.  Everything moved the story forward, and then looped back on itself, and revealed the closest equivalent to literary layers I've seen in a movie in some time.The Royal Tenenbaums captured me with its visual intensity -- the expert eye behind its framed precision -- but I'm afraid I felt nothing for the goings on or the outcome.  Because of the star caliber of its cast, you can't help but wait and see what a film by Anderson and Wilson does with Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelica Huston in the same scene.  Unfortunately, it does nothing.  The offbeat conceits -- and there are many -- never quite gel.  The film has a couple of false climaxes that make a not-too-long movie feel like it was over twenty minutes ago.  Gene Hackman courses through his scenes with terrific verve and gravity, but the subject matter that surrounds him can't catch up.  Wes Anderson is always on his toes, but like Andy Boyle in A Life Less Ordinary, he blisses out on his own genius.  The net effect is merely satisfying.Happily, Anderson's preoccupation with individuality and the comfort in eccentricity are all intact.  And the Wilson brothers, in character, share some terrifically understated moments of tenderness.  I think Luke Wilson dragged this movie kicking and screaming out of the cerebrum and into the visceral world of human hurt and failing.  He was terrific even when he wasn't doing anything but looking abandoned and broken.Here's to the director with the best eye for filming beautiful children.

Like 'Rushmore' and 'Election', this film is populated with self-absorbed characters that are all but totally unlikable (another bad trend from this new generation of 'hip' annoying filmmakers), which in the end makes you unsure of how you want the film to resolve itself in the end.The cast is certainly noteworthy, and a particular mention should go to Gene Hackman, who is excellent (as we have come to expect) as the Family Patriarch who is trying to mend some long-burned bridges late in life. Gwyneth Paltrow looks great and gives a solid low-key performance as well. Danny Glover and (particularly) Bill Murray are all but wasted in supporting roles. The cast as a whole does a great job, and they are easily the best part of the production; the film is almost worth seeing for the great work of the 'all star' cast.It is too bad...that the filmmakers were so desperate to prove how quirky they can be.

697679,A14B73GG8OFXKH,B0000640VJ,Amazon Customer,"[0, 3]","First of all, let me say that this is one of my favorite movies of the year.  If I had never heard of Wes Anderson before seeing this movie, I may have been completely blown away.  However, having seen Rushmore and Bottle Rocket probably a dozen or more times, I went into the theater with certain expectations; namely, that Royal Tenenbaums would be one the best movies I'd ever seen.  These expectations were reinforced by the critics, who  are calling this one of the best of the year, better than Rushmore, one of the greatest comedies ever.The main problem with the RT's for me was that it was too complicated -- I don't mean that it was cryptic or confusing, just that there were too many characters and too many plots happening at once.  There have been movies that have had more characters, such as Short Cuts, that were very successful, but these movies are motivated by the interaction between characters and by coincidences, whereas the RT's is really about character development, as are all of Anderson's films.  And the problem is that there just isn't enough time to develop all the characters, and many of them are treated superficially.Don't get me wrong.  There are incredibly funny scenes in this movie, and overall it is very intellegent and worth seeing.

697680,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000640VJ,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 5]","I think I mentioned before that Wes Anderson is a little hit or miss with me.  Sometimes he really nails it (`Fantastic Mr. Fox') and other times his chaotic mixture of comedic absurdity and dramatic tension is a little out of balance and somewhat annoying (`Rushmore').  `The Royal Tenenbaums' was the first film I ever saw by Anderson, and it still remains my favorite.  The film is simply stunning, the perfect balance of drama and humor, with a winning cast who makes the most out of every second they are on screen.This film sadly comes in second to `Gosford Park' in both ensemble and screenplay for me this year, but it is a VERY close second.This film tells the story of Royal Tenenbaum, an aging patriarch to a family of geniuses.  Royal is a very hard man to get along with, and his family has grown quite detached from him.  As he approaches the end of his life he becomes aware of his failings as a father and desires to make amends.  As with any relationship, the longer it goes unattended the harder it is to mend.  Despite his efforts, Royal doesn't seem to understand how to fix the mess he created.But of course, where there is a will there is a way.The screenplay is honestly a work of genius.  I mean, both this and `Gosford Park' probably constitute two of the best screenplays of the entire decade (both would lose to `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', but that is one of the greatest screenplays ever written in the entire history of cinema).  Anderson and co-writer (and one of the films stars) Owen Wilson really work comedic magic, weaving these absurd yet surprisingly deep and moving characters through a whirlwind of inspiring and original sub-plots that never once become tedious or confusing.  Everything here only serves to deepen our appreciation for the story being told.And that appreciation is immortalized in the films ensemble.  Like with their screenplays, both this film and `Gosford Park' are two of the best ensembles of the decade (they may actually be the two best).  Every performance here is on point and perfectly compliments the other.  Gene Hackman (one of the best actors to ever walk the earth) is perfection here, cultivating a deadpan comedic delivery that rivals Bill Murray's masterful work in `Lost in Translation'.  Ben Stiller, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, Owen Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow (total highlight), Luke Wilson, (the glorious) Anjelica Huston and the hysterical Kumar Pallana all add to the films comedic core with richly detailed performances.With scenes that will stay with you long after the film has ended (that car crash scene alone is cinematic perfection), `The Royal Tenenbaums' is, like my title suggests, comedic royalty.I understand that this film is not for everyone.  Like I personally admitted, Wes Anderson is not a director whose vision is universally understood or even appreciated.  I don't even appreciate all his work, but I admire and respect his dedication to his craft.  At least he has a vision.  He isn't a generic director.  His work speaks loudly as to the man that he is and the visionary he has become.  You know a Wes film when you see it, and that is the mark of a true auteur.  Whether you love him, hate him or are still trying to make up your mind, we all can respect him for what he has achieved.He has a achieved a lot with this magnificent film!",5,This film is comedic royalty!,1271376000,"04 16, 2010",2010,3349,"['think', 'mentioned', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'little', 'hit', 'miss', 'Sometimes', 'really', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'other', 'times', 'chaotic', 'mixture', 'comedic', 'absurdity', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'little', 'balance', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'Rushmore', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'Anderson', 'still', 'favorite', 'film', 'simply', 'stunning', 'perfect', 'balance', 'drama', 'humor', 'winning', 'cast', 'who', 'most', 'second', 'are', 'screen.This', 'film', 'sadly', 'second', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'ensemble', 'screenplay', 'year', 'VERY', 'close', 'second.This', 'film', 'story', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'aging', 'patriarch', 'family', 'geniuses', 'Royal', 'very', 'hard', 'man', 'get', 'family', 'grown', 'quite', 'detached', 'end', 'life', 'aware', 'failings', 'father', 'make', 'amends', 'relationship', 'longer', 'unattended', 'harder', 'mend', 'efforts', 'Royal', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'how', 'fix', 'mess', 'course', 'where', 'will', 'way.The', 'screenplay', 'honestly', 'work', 'genius', 'mean', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'probably', 'constitute', 'two', 'best', 'screenplays', 'entire', 'decade', 'would', 'lose', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'one', 'greatest', 'screenplays', 'ever', 'written', 'entire', 'history', 'cinema', 'Anderson', 'co-writer', 'one', 'films', 'stars', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'really', 'work', 'comedic', 'magic', 'weaving', 'absurd', 'yet', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'moving', 'characters', 'whirlwind', 'inspiring', 'original', 'sub-plots', 'never', 'once', 'become', 'tedious', 'confusing', 'Everything', 'here', 'only', 'deepen', 'appreciation', 'story', 'being', 'told.And', 'appreciation', 'immortalized', 'films', 'ensemble', 'screenplays', 'film', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'ensembles', 'decade', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'two', 'best', 'performance', 'here', 'point', 'perfectly', 'compliments', 'other', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'ever', 'walk', 'earth', 'perfection', 'here', 'cultivating', 'deadpan', 'comedic', 'delivery', 'rivals', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'masterful', 'work', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'total', 'highlight', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'glorious', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'hysterical', 'Kumar', 'Pallana', 'add', 'films', 'comedic', 'core', 'richly', 'detailed', 'performances.With', 'scenes', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'film', 'ended', 'car', 'crash', 'scene', 'alone', 'cinematic', 'perfection', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'title', 'comedic', 'royalty.I', 'understand', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'personally', 'admitted', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'not', 'director', 'vision', 'universally', 'understood', 'even', 'appreciated', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'appreciate', 'work', 'admire', 'respect', 'dedication', 'craft', 'least', 'vision', ""n't"", 'generic', 'director', 'work', 'speaks', 'loudly', 'man', 'visionary', 'become', 'know', 'Wes', 'film', 'when', 'see', 'mark', 'true', 'auteur', 'love', 'hate', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'can', 'respect', 'what', 'achieved.He', 'achieved', 'lot', 'magnificent', 'film']",The Royal Tenenbaums

It is one of the most darkly funny movies I have seen in recent years, and definitely one of the most entertaining.Wes Anderson's gift lies in his characters, and he introduces quite a few uniques ones in this movie. At the center of the movie is the hilariously disfunctional family, the Tenebaums. The father, Royal (Gene Hackman), after years of estrangement from both his wife and children, tries to get back into their lives. The history of the family is, as you will find out, is as checkered as their present. Ben Stiller plays the former child prodigy of the business world who, after losing his wife, devotes his to insanely watching over his two children. Gwenyth Paltrow plays a depressed, washed-up, chain-smoking playwrite who hasn't produced anything for years. Luke Wilson plays a former tennis pro who give up the game to wander the world in limbo, carrying some emotional scars with him (you'll find out when watch the movie). Royal now wants to set things right with his family, but meets some resistence, obviously he wasn't the best father and husband. Anjelica Houston, Bill Murray, and Danny Glover have terrific supporting roles.Wes Anderson's trademark of cut scenes, flashbacks, and outrageous theatrics all blend to make &quot;The Royal Tenebaums&quot; a wholly pleasing experience. It is depressing at times, though, and more serious than Anderson's earlier films. Still, it is dark comedy at it's best.The DVD edition contains loads of extras, spanning 2 DVDs.

Gene Hackman (""The French Connection"") and Anjelica Huston (""Ever After"") are Royal and Etheline Tenenbaum, the parents whose breakup sends their three children into turmoil.

All are successful, all are miserable.Until, that is, Royal decides he wants his family together again, and that the only way to do that is to pretend to be suffering from a terminal disease.Dark and moody, this film is nevertheless brilliantly written and executed with a great cast that also includes Danny Glover (""Lethal Weapon"") and Bill Murray (""Ghostbusters""). The only downside for me was the inclusion of co-writer Owen Wilson (""Shanghai Noon"") as the neighbor/would-be-Tenenbaum Eli Cash. I'm sorry, I just can't stand the guy as an actor. He always comes across as wooden and not funny and he looks like he's got a broken nose.

So I didn't really get the sense that he was the reason his kids turned out to be such failures. Overall I would simply have to say that as a comedy it failed, ditto in the drama department, and I barely made it through the entire thing.

That there are many who do not ""get"" it only adds to that appeal.  I have friends who are intelligent and love movies and have great senses of humor, yet they have watched this movie and upon returning it have told me they just didn't enjoy it. That happens with this movie.Yet I still think this is one of the funniest films I have ever seen.  And yes: the fact that it appeals only to certain of us makes it even more endearing.For those of you who are reading this and wonder if you will like TRT, consider this: did you likeArrested Development: The Complete Series, orCurb Your Enthusiasm?  How aboutJuno?  Mind you, these are not absolute, but if you enjoy absurdist family humor that is fairly ""dry,"" then TRT might just be for you.The movie is directed by Wes Anderson, who co-wrote the movie with Owen Wilson. Anderson has a history of quirky movies (Rushmore,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) in which he seems to revel in letting his actors expand within their characterizations and take over the movie.  He also has an expert touch with cinematography; his sets are intimate and charming, creating a homey quality that comes next to claustrophobic, reveling in an expert sense of capturing the moments of character discovery that so often happen within his movies.Here it is no different, as plot is almost secondary to characterization.  It is our coming to terms with these wealthy, privileged but ultimately lost human beings that drives our appreciation of the movie.  In short, if you don't like the characters here, you won't like this movie.  As such, I think discussion of the characters is more important than any real plot summary ...Royal Tenenbaum, played by everyman actor Gene Hackman, is the head of a severely crippled family that is more or less stumbling on forward with life.  Perhaps the truest synopsis of this family's problems is that they achieved success too early and are wading aimlessly now in the tide pool of that success, trying to find their way ahead.  Though the movie begins with the estranged Royal explaining his upcoming divorce to his three grown children, it is only in the broadest sense that it could be said the movie is told from his perspective, in that we observe this mess of a family from the outside looking in.His wife is Etheline, played by the marvelous Anjelica Huston.  A noted archeologist, that she is attempting to divorce her husband is no surprise, but Henry, her accountant and the man she hopes to someday marry, is played by Danny Glover and he could be no more different than Royal if he tried.  He is careful, tactful, thoughtful...and quite dull.The children consist of:Chas, obsessively played by an angry Ben Stiller:  An international finance expert, Chas sued his father when he was in his early teens due to his father's theft of his savings bonds.  Most importantly, however, he is a frenetic father whose inability to deal with his wife's death in a plane crash leads him to cling to his children like a mother hen in a doghouse. He openly hates his father, who shot him in the back with a BB gun when he was young.Margot, portrayed by a wispy Gwyneth Paltrow.  She is adopted - a fact her father continuously refers to in front of her -- she is a playwright who won a grant when she was a high school freshman, but now spends her days eluding her husband by soaking in a bathtub and secretly smoking.  She has half a finger missing but will not tell her family how it happened.Richie, ably played by Luke Wilson: A tennis pro who broke down and quit in the midst of a title match at the peak of his career, he is obsessed with adopted sister, and likely quit as a reaction to her marriage.  He spends his time living as a passenger on an ocean liner.Eli, played by an achingly hopeful yet sad Owen Wilson, is NOT a Tenenbaum, but dearly wishes to be.  He is a young author of Western novels who now spends his days addled on drugs.

697701,A1M1F4Y0GYNT1N,B0000640VJ,"Brian E. Lewis ""onouris""","[8, 12]","So many people wanted to like this movie, and so few did. So few really seem to understand what Wes Anderson does. Why is that? People aren't stupid, they just have preconceptions. People go to see a Wes Anderson movie, thinking they're going to see a comedy. This movie isn't a comedy. It's a highly idiosyncratic drama that happens to be funny. If people approached him that way, I think they'd leave happier. To be fair, the trailers for this movie were horrible: they chopped it up and tried to make it look like something it wasn't: a comedy.Wes Anderson is that rarest of filmmakers: subtle. He also manages to be idiosyncratic and clever without being derivative, crass, expoitative, or facile. You know, like Quentin Tarantino, Hack of the Century. It's no surprise that Tarantino's best film, Jackie Brown, is the one that most eschews the stylistic tics he's best known for. I actually enjoy his films, but he's had the unfortunate side effect of creating a vast undead legion of imitators. For that alone, he's the worst thing to happen to film in many many years. QT's films are essentially the cinema equivalent of Bazooka Joe: a plastic brick wrapped in a shiny, appealing wrapper.  Anyway, this review is supposed to be for Tenenbaums...Like most Anderson films, this is about fathers and families, and it's remarkably sensitive. Don't make the mistake of seeing only the eccentricities: those are just a storytelling technique. This movie is ultimately about squandered potential, self-sabotage, and that painful realization that you're NOT a genius. The Tenenbaums had the childhood we all though we deserved: adulation and recognition. They lost it, and the film is really about coming to terms with that loss, and constructing an identity outside of those unreal expectations. For Royal, it's about reclaiming something he gave away, something his self-image kept him from knowing that he wanted. The point is that all too often it takes staggering, heart-breaking failure before we'll really confront ourselves.The various quirks of the characters, while well drawn and amusing, are there for a purpose: they are magnifications of the idiosyncrasies we all have. Dramatically, they also save it from being yet another of those student-film talky ""family dysfunction"" movies. Despite their cartoonish natures, I find the interaction of the characters much more true to life than most such dramas.Anderson is a remarkable director: his attention to detail and ability to sympathize with the characters, as well as wring the most from his actors, is truly admirable. But he's best as a writer. The script, just as in Rushmore, is remarkably subtle. All the conversations are oblique and rich in subtext. Again, this is so important: pay attention to people, and you realize that we seldom ever say exactly what we're thinking, and when we do, we may not really mean it. Nothing in this film is unmotivated, random, or false. And most importantly, the style, which is pronounced, serves the story, not vice versa.If you're sick of McMovies, music videos blown up to 90 minutes, and trivia rants mixed with violence and served up as cinema, by all means check out this movie. If you think Reservoir Dogs was the best thing to ever happen to film, pass on by, and God help you.",5,"Underrated, underappreciated beauty.",1102464000,"12 8, 2004",2004,3291,"['So', 'many', 'people', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'so', 'few', 'did', 'few', 'really', 'seem', 'understand', 'what', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Why', 'People', 'are', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'just', 'have', 'preconceptions', 'People', 'go', 'see', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'movie', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'comedy', 'movie', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'highly', 'idiosyncratic', 'drama', 'be', 'funny', 'people', 'approached', 'way', 'think', ""'d"", 'leave', 'happier', 'be', 'fair', 'trailers', 'movie', 'were', 'horrible', 'chopped', 'up', 'tried', 'make', 'look', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'comedy.Wes', 'Anderson', 'rarest', 'filmmakers', 'subtle', 'also', 'be', 'idiosyncratic', 'clever', 'being', 'derivative', 'crass', 'expoitative', 'facile', 'know', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Hack', 'Century', 'surprise', 'Tarantino', 'best', 'film', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'one', 'most', 'eschews', 'stylistic', 'tics', 'best', 'known', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'films', 'had', 'unfortunate', 'side', 'effect', 'creating', 'vast', 'undead', 'legion', 'imitators', 'alone', 'worst', 'thing', 'happen', 'film', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'QT', 'films', 'are', 'essentially', 'cinema', 'equivalent', 'Bazooka', 'Joe', 'plastic', 'brick', 'wrapped', 'shiny', 'appealing', 'wrapper', 'Anyway', 'review', 'supposed', 'be', 'Tenenbaums', 'most', 'Anderson', 'films', 'fathers', 'families', 'remarkably', 'sensitive', 'Do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'seeing', 'only', 'eccentricities', 'are', 'just', 'storytelling', 'technique', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'squandered', 'potential', 'self-sabotage', 'painful', 'realization', ""'re"", 'genius', 'Tenenbaums', 'had', 'childhood', 'deserved', 'adulation', 'recognition', 'lost', 'film', 'really', 'about', 'coming', 'terms', 'loss', 'constructing', 'identity', 'unreal', 'expectations', 'Royal', 'reclaiming', 'something', 'gave', 'away', 'something', 'self-image', 'kept', 'knowing', 'wanted', 'point', 'too', 'often', 'staggering', 'heart-breaking', 'failure', ""'ll"", 'really', 'confront', 'ourselves.The', 'various', 'quirks', 'characters', 'well', 'drawn', 'amusing', 'are', 'there', 'purpose', 'are', 'magnifications', 'idiosyncrasies', 'have', 'Dramatically', 'also', 'save', 'being', 'yet', 'student-film', 'talky', 'family', 'dysfunction', 'movies', 'cartoonish', 'natures', 'find', 'interaction', 'characters', 'much', 'more', 'true', 'life', 'most', 'such', 'dramas.Anderson', 'remarkable', 'director', 'attention', 'detail', 'ability', 'sympathize', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'wring', 'most', 'actors', 'truly', 'admirable', 'best', 'writer', 'script', 'just', 'Rushmore', 'remarkably', 'subtle', 'conversations', 'are', 'oblique', 'rich', 'subtext', 'Again', 'so', 'important', 'pay', 'attention', 'people', 'realize', 'seldom', 'ever', 'say', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'when', 'do', 'may', 'not', 'really', 'mean', 'Nothing', 'film', 'unmotivated', 'random', 'false', 'most', 'importantly', 'style', 'pronounced', 'story', 'not', 'vice', 'versa.If', ""'re"", 'sick', 'McMovies', 'music', 'videos', 'blown', 'up', '90', 'minutes', 'trivia', 'rants', 'mixed', 'violence', 'served', 'up', 'cinema', 'means', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'think', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'happen', 'film', 'pass', 'God', 'help']",The Royal Tenenbaums

His entire family is eccentric and bizarre and that is what is explored in detail with Stiller, Wilson and Paltrow as his grown children and Huston as his estranged wife. Stiller cannot get over his wife's death in a crash and has become morbidly overprotective of his own children.  Paltrow is just downright weird and the major part of her story is her unrequited (or is it?) love for her brother (Luke Wilson) who is not her brother by blood.  His story is the flip of hers.  Huston wants to finally divorce Hackman (Royal Tenenbaum) so she can marry Danny Glover who is a bit of a stuffed shirt.

Newman ""moodindigo2""","[3, 5]","The trailers for ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" offered glimpses of a film I knew would be different than the usual tripe one gets from a Hollywood comedy these days.  Don't get me wrong, films like ""Dumb and Dumber"" by the Farrelly brothers have their place and are a necessary evil in the world of comedies to maintain balance.  But the 5000 [others] that followed suit have tilted the American comedy towards a less and less appealing mediocrity.So when a film like this comes along that dares and strives to be different in a humorous sense, the balance is restored, and Wes Anderson champions again the dry and sly wit that makes one perpetually chuckle instead of occasionally laugh.  As he did in ""Rushmore"", Anderson has elevated dead-pan comedy to another level.  Much like the Coen brothers did for ""Barton Fink"" and ""Fargo"", Wes Anderson points out the absurdities of reality, and lets these subtle idiosynchrasies speak for themselves.  It's Zen-comedy that tries by not trying.  And it works.Luke Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow play parts that seem as if written for them (and an excellent vehicle for Gwyneth to show her hidden talents as an actress).  The neurotic Ben Stiller and remedial Danny Glover seem a bit our of place in a film that moves like an Austrian cuckoo clock between scenes, but Gene Hackman does an excellent job portraying the asinine father that binds the family together against their will.So if you're looking for humor dumbed-down for easy accessibility, you're coming to the wrong film.  But if you enjoy comedic style perfected by the British in the sixties and revamped and modernized by the Coens and Wes Anderson in the 21st century, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a must-have for those who like to chuckle for two hours straight.",4,For those thirsty for dry humor,1029110400,"08 12, 2002",2002,1758,"['trailers', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'offered', 'glimpses', 'film', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'usual', 'tripe', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'comedy', 'days', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'films', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'have', 'place', 'are', 'necessary', 'evil', 'world', 'comedies', 'maintain', 'balance', '5000', '[', 'others', ']', 'followed', 'suit', 'have', 'tilted', 'American', 'comedy', 'less', 'less', 'appealing', 'mediocrity.So', 'when', 'film', 'along', 'dares', 'strives', 'be', 'different', 'humorous', 'sense', 'balance', 'restored', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'champions', 'again', 'dry', 'sly', 'one', 'perpetually', 'chuckle', 'instead', 'occasionally', 'laugh', 'did', 'Rushmore', 'Anderson', 'elevated', 'dead-pan', 'comedy', 'level', 'Much', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'did', 'Barton', 'Fink', 'Fargo', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'out', 'absurdities', 'reality', 'subtle', 'idiosynchrasies', 'speak', 'Zen-comedy', 'tries', 'not', 'trying', 'Wilson', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'play', 'parts', 'seem', 'written', 'excellent', 'vehicle', 'Gwyneth', 'show', 'hidden', 'talents', 'actress', 'neurotic', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'remedial', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'seem', 'bit', 'place', 'film', 'Austrian', 'cuckoo', 'clock', 'scenes', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'asinine', 'father', 'family', 'together', 'will.So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'humor', 'dumbed-down', 'easy', 'accessibility', ""'re"", 'coming', 'wrong', 'film', 'enjoy', 'comedic', 'style', 'perfected', 'British', 'sixties', 'revamped', 'modernized', 'Coens', 'Wes', 'Anderson', '21st', 'century', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'must-have', 'who', 'like', 'chuckle', 'two', 'hours', 'straight']",The Royal Tenenbaums

Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), has three kids who are all geniuses, and a wife. He leaves the family for several years, and finally decides to come back home to get his family back together. But now his kids are all grown up. Chas Tenenbaum (Ben Stiller) never got over the fact that his father was never there for him and even fired him from the job they both owned. Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson) was a professional champion tennis player at a very young age until he quit unexpectedly. And Margot Tenenbaum (Gwyneth Paltrow) wrote her own plays and later when she grew up, seduced a bunch of men and married a much older man, named Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray). The mother, Dr. Ethel Tenenbaum (Angelica Houston) is now an archaeologist and has fallen in love with another man, Henry Sherman (Danny Glover). Royal comes back to his family claiming to have cancer and six weeks left to leave. They all feel guilty, so they let him stay. But when the family finds out that Royal was faking his illness, he has to prove to his family that he is worth their time and tries to win them back.With an all-star cast and a superb script written by Anderson and Owen Wilson (who also costars in the film as Richie's best friend, Eli Cash), ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is not to be missed. It's hilarious and witty. The criterion collection DVD is also a must, with special bonus features including interviews with the cast and filmmakers, outtakes, and more. The DVD comes in wide screen format. The film is also narrated by Alec Baldwin. One of the best films of last year.I highly recommend ""The Royal Tenenbaums"".Score:100/100A+",5,A comedy fit for a royal.,1034380800,"10 12, 2002",2002,1725,"['Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'directed', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'three', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'geniuses', 'wife', 'family', 'several', 'years', 'finally', 'decides', 'come', 'back', 'home', 'get', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'now', 'kids', 'are', 'grown', 'up', 'Chas', 'Tenenbaum', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'never', 'got', 'fact', 'father', 'was', 'never', 'there', 'even', 'fired', 'job', 'owned', 'Richie', 'Tenenbaum', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'was', 'professional', 'champion', 'tennis', 'player', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'quit', 'unexpectedly', 'Margot', 'Tenenbaum', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'wrote', 'own', 'plays', 'later', 'when', 'grew', 'up', 'seduced', 'bunch', 'men', 'married', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'named', 'Raleigh', 'St.', 'Clair', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'mother', 'Dr.', 'Ethel', 'Tenenbaum', 'Angelica', 'Houston', 'now', 'archaeologist', 'fallen', 'love', 'man', 'Henry', 'Sherman', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Royal', 'back', 'family', 'claiming', 'have', 'cancer', 'six', 'weeks', 'left', 'leave', 'feel', 'guilty', 'let', 'stay', 'when', 'family', 'out', 'Royal', 'was', 'faking', 'illness', 'prove', 'family', 'time', 'tries', 'win', 'back.With', 'all-star', 'cast', 'superb', 'script', 'written', 'Anderson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'Richie', 'best', 'friend', 'Eli', 'Cash', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'hilarious', 'witty', 'criterion', 'collection', 'DVD', 'also', 'must', 'special', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'interviews', 'cast', 'filmmakers', 'outtakes', 'more', 'DVD', 'wide', 'screen', 'format', 'film', 'also', 'narrated', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'One', 'best', 'films', 'last', 'year.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', '.Score:100/100A+']",The Royal Tenenbaums

Or consider the synopsis of the plot - a family of dsyfunctional geniuses reconcile after decades of failure.  Open the package of this DVD and you will immediately notice the love in which the film was made, right down to the personable scetches created by the director's brother.Now imagine watching this movie and have all you're expectations met or exceeded.  That was my experience. This movie has become one of my all-time favorite films, something I've treasured and pondered long after I watched it.Nothing at all is ordinary in this film.  The presense of Angelia Huston gave me the impression of a modern-day Addams Family, most everything bizarre and fascinating like that family was.  The exiled head of the family, Royal Tenenbaum, attempts to reconcile with everyone by pulling a [quick one] on them.  Richard Tenenbaum falls in love with his sister and lives in a tent in the middle of his room.  Clas Tenenbaum is a childhood business mogol who is obsessed with safety after his wife dies, and thus dresses himself and his children in identical, bright-red jumpsuits.Each scene plays out like the characters - highly defined, quick witted and quick paced, backed with energy and emotion, and before you realized everything you saw, you're on to the next one.  The conflicts resolve in a satisfying yet never-predictable way - nothing you ever are hoping for happens, and yet everyone ends up happy.  The messages of redemption after failure are my favorite, and give this movie itself greatest weight.

Though far from a masterpiece, it's a highly entertaining film, though its' attempts at being quirky for quirky's sake threaten to undermine the picture on more than one occasion.  The highly  dysfunctional Tennenbaum clan is the crux of the story, with backstory on the characters and other parts of the film  narrated deftly by Alec Baldwin.

Fairing less well are the remaining male cast, particurly Ben Stiller(doing his  umpteenth take on ""the weirdest one in the crowd"")and Luke Wilson, who continues to mistake his brand of laid-back  acting as some tiny ray of talent(sorry, but I have yet to  see it).

697718,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B0000640VJ,Christopher Culver,"[4, 9]","After gaining attention with his quirky early films BOTTLE ROCKET and RUSHMORE, writer and director Wes Anderson was able to bring together a wide Hollywood cast for his ambitious 2001 effort THE ROYAL TENNEBAUMS. As the movie opens, we are shown the rise of the three children of the Tannebaum family, prodigies who excel in business, sports and literature respectively. The upbringing of these little geniuses is left to their mother Etheline (Angelica Huston) after their father Royal (Gene Hackman) leaves the family. We flashforward to the present day, where the family has fallen from glory. Chas Tennenbaum (Ben Stiller) is too crushed by the death of his wife to focus on business, Margot (Gwenyth Paltrow) hasn't written a play in years and sulks most of the day in the bathtub, and Richie (Luke Wilson) retired from tennis after mysterious blowing his last game. It is at this time that their father returns, and the reconciliation between the family members is the story of the film.Wes Anderson retains his quirky sense of humour here. Though ostensibly set in the present day, the lives of the characters occasionally seem bound in traditions of a century ago, as when Royal has an Indian servant, and one of Etheline's suitors is a polar explorer, and this gives a certain charm to the picture. Another amusing Anderson touch is the sheer detail of the sets, with background items like newspaper clippings, portraits and bookshelf contents providing a feeling that these characters are fully formed and have a past. I think that the best part of the film may in fact be the supporting cast. Bill Murray, who plays Margot's husband, was to go on to play this type of jaded, unhappy middle-aged man in several films until it just stopped being fun anymore, but this early go at it is quite entertaining. Owen Wilson's character Eli Cash is hilarious, an author of Western novels who gets so caught up in the mythology of the Old West that he starts taking mescaline and descends into drug addiction. In some respects, Cash is similar to Wilson's character Hansel inZoolanderof the same year.Unfortunately, I think the film is flawed. Anderson has certainly learnt much from earlier film-makers, especially the great European auteurs of the 1950s and 1960s, but there's too often a sense that the film is imitation instead of original insight. This sense of discomfort only increases on re-watching the film. I also find the soundtrack extremely incongruent with the rest of the production.

Wes Anderson, the critically acclaimed director of Rushmore, has served up a heartbreaking yet hilarious picture.  Brilliant dialogue, melancholy/beautiful cinematography, and one of Gene Hackman's finest performances, The Royal Tenenbaums is a terrific film.Gene Hackman plays Royal Tenenbaum, an entrepreneur who has recently fallen on hard times.  His family hates him, he has no money, and his ex-wife (despite the fact they're not legally divorced) is about to marry the family accountant.  In one last effort to win his family back, Royal tells his ex-wife (played by Angelica Huston) that he's dying of cancer.  Soon, the entire family knows and Royal begins his task of winning his family back.The film's greatest virtue is the characters.  Like Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, the characters are all incredibly quirky, but they're all completely relatable.  Why?  Because they're dealing with situations that we deal with everyday, and that's what makes Wes Anderson such a creative new talent.  As weird as everyone is, you really do care about what happens to them.As I said, the film contains one of Hackman's best performances to date.  But he's not the only one.  Luke Wilson is particularly enjoyable as Richie Tenenbaum, the ex-tennis player who is deeply in love with his adopted sister Margot (Gwenyth Paltrow).  Ben Stiller gives his best performance to date as Chas, Royal's hate-filled son.  Gwenyth Paltrow gives one of her only tolerable performances ever.

697722,AS558SNWF1DXG,B0000640VJ,Clare Quilty,"[38, 44]","I'm a Wes Anderson fan and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" was my favorite movie of the year.(just for a reference, the others were ""Hedwig & the Angry Inch,"" ""Ali,"" ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" and ""Training Day,"" and Ken Burns ""Jazz"" and ""The Sopranos: Season 3,"" both of which may have been on TV but are of a scope and caliber far beyond most multiplex efforts)But ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" took me a while.  It took me two viewings to fully appreciate the ""Tenenbaums,"" and a third to convince me I loved it.This is a rich movie, full of detail that initially moved too fast for me to absorb.  It was only after I was able to watch the film without wondering where it was going and what was going to happen that I was able to sit back and fully appreciate it.  There's a lot of quirkiness here, and that gives the whole thing a feeling of insincerity, but this is not an insincere film.Many critics have pointed out that this movie is like a lot of other things; they mention Dickens, John Irving, Salinger, and Louise Fitzhugh and ""The Magnificent Ambersons.""  And all of those comparisons are true.But what really struck me about the film, personally, is that so much of it didn't remind me of anything else.  The open credit sequence, for example, fills my heart with joy, just the way all the characters are introduced in a stylised yet somehow naturalistic way.  You have to love a movie (or at least *I* have to love a movie) in which characters' introductions include their book jackets.There's also the Gene Hackman aspect.  I'm a huge Hackman fan but he works so often and in so many different directions it's sometimes hard to remember what makes him so distinctive.  In this movie, it's all on display.  He is truly inspired.  The fact that he was ignored by the Academy means that I don't have to take anything they say seriously, ever again.Also, the scenes set in Eli Cash's apartment gave me more laughter than any comedy I've seen since ""Kingpin.""  And the scene, near the end, in the ambulance (set to Nico's ""Fairest of Seasons"") made me genuinely sadder than any recent movie I can think of.This is not a particularly easy movie.

Some people are completely lost anyway, given the number of factual errors that occur in the reviews printed here.A brief summary: The story starts with all of the Tenenbaum children, who appear to be in their thirties, moving back to their mother's home, a castle-sized house located somewhere in New York. Explanations are skimpy for this at best. At the same time, across town, their father, estranged from the family for years, needs a free place to stay.So, for the first time in 18 years, all of the Tenenbaums are together under one roof.The mood of the film varies like the weather. Sometimes it is beautiful and sunny; sometimes it is grey and snowing.Flashback to 18 years ago: Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman)  is a successful litigator, his wife, Etheline (Angelica Huston) an anthropologist, the three children are prodigies:Ritchie  (Luke Wilson), a tennis championChas (Ben Stiller), a wizard at businessAdopted daughter Margot (Gweneth Paltrow), a successful playwrightThe marriage breaks up, the children grow up but not well, Etheline dates but does not remarry, in fact, she and Royal are still not divorced.What little action there is seems to be spurred by Etheline's deciding to get married again (to her accountant, played hesitantly by Danny Glover). Royal's competitive juices, so long dormant, are revived, and he stages a play for Etheline's love and sympathy by pretending to be dying of cancer (despite eating a lot of cheeseburgers).The deus ex machina, that moves the story along to completion, is provided by a family friend called Eli Cash (Owen Wilson), who is presented as a drug-addicted novelist but who is really addicted to the Tenenbaum family.In contrast to the narrator, who gives a perfectly flat delivery, the music functions as a barometer of affect for each scene.Don't expect to get it all the first time; pick up this snow globe and give it another shake.",5,Tell me a story. . .,1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,2389,"['Tell', 'story', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'started', 'out', 'book', 'one', 'ofthose', 'books', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'illustrations', 'can', 'imagine', 'characters', 'mostly', 'bit', 'help', 'author.As', 'story', 'not', 'fact', 'book', 'am', 'going', 'say', 'snow', 'globe', 'tiny', 'universe', 'sense', 'press', 'nose', 'up', 'glass', 'squint.Without', 'narrator', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'lost', 'people', 'are', 'completely', 'lost', 'anyway', 'given', 'number', 'factual', 'errors', 'occur', 'reviews', 'printed', 'here.A', 'brief', 'summary', 'story', 'Tenenbaum', 'children', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'thirties', 'moving', 'back', 'mother', 'home', 'castle-sized', 'house', 'located', 'somewhere', 'New', 'York', 'Explanations', 'are', 'skimpy', 'best', 'same', 'time', 'town', 'father', 'estranged', 'family', 'years', 'free', 'place', 'stay.So', 'first', 'time', '18', 'years', 'Tenenbaums', 'are', 'together', 'one', 'roof.The', 'mood', 'film', 'varies', 'weather', 'Sometimes', 'beautiful', 'sunny', 'grey', 'snowing.Flashback', '18', 'years', 'ago', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'successful', 'litigator', 'wife', 'Etheline', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'anthropologist', 'three', 'children', 'are', 'prodigies', 'Ritchie', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'tennis', 'championChas', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'wizard', 'businessAdopted', 'daughter', 'Margot', 'Gweneth', 'Paltrow', 'successful', 'playwrightThe', 'marriage', 'up', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'not', 'well', 'Etheline', 'not', 'remarry', 'fact', 'Royal', 'are', 'still', 'not', 'divorced.What', 'little', 'action', 'be', 'spurred', 'Etheline', 'deciding', 'get', 'married', 'again', 'accountant', 'played', 'hesitantly', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Royal', 'competitive', 'juices', 'so', 'long', 'dormant', 'are', 'revived', 'play', 'Etheline', 'love', 'sympathy', 'pretending', 'be', 'dying', 'cancer', 'eating', 'lot', 'cheeseburgers', '.The', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'story', 'completion', 'provided', 'family', 'friend', 'called', 'Eli', 'Cash', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'who', 'presented', 'drug-addicted', 'novelist', 'who', 'really', 'addicted', 'Tenenbaum', 'family.In', 'contrast', 'narrator', 'who', 'perfectly', 'flat', 'delivery', 'music', 'functions', 'barometer', 'affect', 'scene.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'get', 'first', 'time', 'pick', 'up', 'snow', 'globe', 'give', 'shake']",The Royal Tenenbaums
697725,A51IK68MWKV5R,B0000640VJ,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[4, 7]","You want to talk about pretentious?  The title of this review is pretentious.  The movie?  Well...let's just say it's incomplete.I enjoyed many aspects of the Royal Tenenbaums, most of all Royal Tenenbaum himself.  One of Hackman's greatest roles, and he dives in head first.  The filmmakers have done a wonderful job of making a sympathetic character out of a bad man.  But he's funny.  Oh, is he funny.  He has all of the film's best lines.  And they're delivered naturally because they're organic.  Anderson and Wilson weren't just forcing some great one-liners for a cheap laugh; you can tell that they are things that a totally non-empathetic guy like Royal would say.On the other hand, why was Bill Murray's character (something St. Clair? I can't even remember his name) even here except to be someone for Margot to leave.  And that boy, Dudley.  Is it just me, or is that Tim Burton, Jr.?Generally Owen Wilson draws my attention in whatever he is in, but here he seems to be wasted in a thankless role of author/druggie/Tenenbaum-wannabe.  But that's the sign of a good writer/actor: not writing yourself the best role.I was entertained by most of the film (the narration by Alec Baldwin didn't even bug me), but about two-thirds of the way through, I started losing interest.  Sure, the ending wrapped everything up nicely, but perhaps it was too nicely?  Should a movie about these people even have a happy ending (such as it was)?But, anyway, I wouldn't know whether to recommend this or not.  It's not a great film, and even some fans of their previous works don't seem to like it, but it appears to be attracting a devoted following, so I guess it's just one of those films that stands alone and draws its own crowd slowly.

697726,A1Y67BEMZMU7SD,B0000640VJ,"Cromulus ""Magnus Cromulus""","[12, 15]","""I've had a rough year, dad"".  That the most moving moment in the entire film is Chas' moment of recognition and admission is no surprise.  Recognition and admission is what this movie is really about.Perhaps one of the many reasons so many people feel a disconnect between themselves and ""The Royal Tennebaums"" is that so much of the film's visual fiber is connected with the characters in order to amplify their idiosyncrasies.  And these peccadilloes get augmented until they're so grotesque and bizarre that no one feels at ease around them.It's hard to relate to a guy who wears nothing but a red warm-up suit through most of the movie.  It's hard to relate to a character who wears a Bjorn Borg bandana on his head and a grizzly Adams beard until he tries to kill himself.  Never mind that he also has a crush on his own sister.  And what's the deal with a guy who dresses up like Custer literally crashing a wedding party while wearing Indian paint on his face?  And just where the hell are we?  Is that New York or Never Land?""The Royal Tennenbaums"", apart from being very sweet and very, very funny, is a subtly uncomfortable movie and it's hard to pin down exactly why that is until you really start to look closely at the characters and what these eccentricities actually mean.  That Ebert sees the characters as islands unto themselves is no great feat since that doesn't really get to the heart of the matter.  Yes, they are islands, but why are they all like Easter Island?The reason that they are all like their own version of Easter Island is because they are all hiding something, most of the time from themselves.  And the movie is over only when the characters have admitted their problems to themselves and each admission is accompanied by a change in the character's image, thereby turning the bizzaro level down and making them humans to whom we can relate to.It is not a surprise that when Chas finally admits that he's had a ""rough year"" he is no longer sporting his warm up suit.  With the moment of recognition, a moment of shedding his old skin has also arrived.  With the weight goes the image.But this is late in the movie.  Earlier than Chas' admission, Richie confronts himself.  That he should be looking in the mirror moments before he tries to kill himself should come as a shock to no one; nor should the fact that he shaves his beard and removes the bandana.  This divorcing himself from the image is integral to the movie.  The image of the character that has been established as one that has a problem is erased.  Admission of the problem (in this case the problem is that he's in love with his own sister) accompanies the change in the visual makeup.  Don't believe me?  Fast forward to the slowest ""member"" of the Tennenbaums, the last to confront his own demons - Eli Cash.  Why do you suppose the guy who's always dressed as a cowboy appears with Indian paint on his face at the end, moments before he admits his own problems with drugs?The fact that Michael Medved doesn't see this is merely testimony to his own near sightedness and ineptness.  There should be a prerequisite test given to all critics that they should only be allowed to comment on that with which they can converse.  Because not understanding something means that they ought to either study it or let it be lest they want to come across as incompetent.""The Royal Tennenbaums"", like all great movies, offers a lot more to discover upon viewing and reviewing.  Why does Chas genetically engineer rodents and what does that have to do with his sons?  Why is the movie set in such a mysterious locale?  What's the deal with the hawk?  And why did Margot really lose her finger?  Thinking about these tings is endlessly rewarding to me and I hope they will be to you, too.  Hopefully the right people will start thinking about this film the way it should be thought about and they can finally elevate it to where it belongs - the pantheon of great films.",5,"The Royal Tennenbaums, image and admission.",1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,3961,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'rough', 'year', 'dad', 'most', 'moving', 'moment', 'entire', 'film', 'Chas', 'moment', 'recognition', 'admission', 'surprise', 'Recognition', 'admission', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about.Perhaps', 'one', 'many', 'reasons', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'feel', 'disconnect', 'Royal', 'Tennebaums', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'visual', 'fiber', 'connected', 'characters', 'order', 'amplify', 'idiosyncrasies', 'peccadilloes', 'get', 'augmented', ""'re"", 'so', 'grotesque', 'bizarre', 'one', 'ease', 'them.It', 'hard', 'relate', 'guy', 'who', 'nothing', 'red', 'warm-up', 'suit', 'most', 'movie', 'hard', 'relate', 'character', 'who', 'Bjorn', 'Borg', 'bandana', 'head', 'grizzly', 'Adams', 'beard', 'kill', 'Never', 'mind', 'also', 'crush', 'own', 'sister', 'what', 'deal', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'Custer', 'literally', 'crashing', 'wedding', 'party', 'wearing', 'Indian', 'paint', 'face', 'just', 'where', 'hell', 'are', 'New', 'York', 'Never', 'Land', 'Royal', 'Tennenbaums', 'apart', 'being', 'very', 'sweet', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'subtly', 'uncomfortable', 'movie', 'hard', 'pin', 'down', 'exactly', 'why', 'really', 'start', 'look', 'closely', 'characters', 'what', 'eccentricities', 'actually', 'mean', 'Ebert', 'characters', 'islands', 'unto', 'great', 'feat', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'heart', 'matter', 'Yes', 'are', 'islands', 'why', 'are', 'like', 'Easter', 'Island', 'reason', 'are', 'own', 'version', 'Easter', 'Island', 'are', 'hiding', 'something', 'most', 'time', 'movie', 'only', 'when', 'characters', 'have', 'admitted', 'problems', 'admission', 'accompanied', 'change', 'character', 'image', 'thereby', 'turning', 'bizzaro', 'level', 'down', 'making', 'humans', 'whom', 'can', 'relate', 'to.It', 'not', 'surprise', 'when', 'Chas', 'finally', 'had', 'rough', 'year', 'no', 'longer', 'sporting', 'warm', 'up', 'suit', 'moment', 'recognition', 'moment', 'shedding', 'old', 'skin', 'also', 'arrived', 'weight', 'image.But', 'late', 'movie', 'Earlier', 'Chas', 'admission', 'Richie', 'should', 'be', 'looking', 'mirror', 'moments', 'kill', 'should', 'come', 'shock', 'one', 'should', 'fact', 'beard', 'bandana', 'divorcing', 'image', 'integral', 'movie', 'image', 'character', 'been', 'established', 'one', 'problem', 'erased', 'Admission', 'problem', 'case', 'problem', 'love', 'own', 'sister', 'change', 'visual', 'makeup', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Fast', 'forward', 'slowest', 'member', 'Tennenbaums', 'last', 'confront', 'own', 'demons', 'Eli', 'Cash', 'Why', 'do', 'suppose', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'dressed', 'cowboy', 'Indian', 'paint', 'face', 'end', 'moments', 'own', 'problems', 'drugs', 'fact', 'Michael', 'Medved', ""n't"", 'see', 'merely', 'testimony', 'own', 'near', 'sightedness', 'ineptness', 'should', 'be', 'prerequisite', 'test', 'given', 'critics', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'allowed', 'comment', 'can', 'converse', 'not', 'understanding', 'something', 'means', 'ought', 'study', 'let', 'be', 'lest', 'want', 'come', 'incompetent', 'Royal', 'Tennenbaums', 'great', 'movies', 'lot', 'more', 'discover', 'viewing', 'reviewing', 'Why', 'Chas', 'genetically', 'rodents', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'sons', 'Why', 'movie', 'set', 'such', 'mysterious', 'locale', 'What', 'deal', 'hawk', 'why', 'did', 'Margot', 'really', 'lose', 'finger', 'Thinking', 'tings', 'endlessly', 'rewarding', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'Hopefully', 'right', 'people', 'will', 'start', 'thinking', 'film', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'thought', 'can', 'finally', 'elevate', 'where', 'pantheon', 'great', 'films']",The Royal Tenenbaums
697727,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0000640VJ,C. Sawin,"[8, 9]","A fair number of individuals are still gushing over ""Moonrise Kingdom."" It's bound to make several best of lists by the end of the year even though it seems like we still have so much left to see with unlimited potential. Wes Anderson has always impressed as far as his filmmaking goes. While you wait for ""Moonrise Kingdom"" to come to Blu-ray, Criterion Collection is getting ready to release ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" on Blu-ray. Speaking as someone who hadn't seen ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" previously, it seemed like the perfect chance to finally get around to doing so.""The Royal Tenenbaums"" looks amazing on Blu-ray. Colors flourish and Anderson's visual style only seems to benefit from high definition. That 70s sense of style also seems to jump out quite a bit, but maybe it already did before the jump to Blu-ray. Anderson gives intricate attention to detail like the wallpaper in the hotel or the paintings in Eli's house and it is just exquisite. All of Anderson's films up until ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" were rated R, but ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" seems to have a darker tone in comparison to all of Anderson's other work. The humor is darker and there's such an emphasis on suicide in the middle of the film. In fact, the exchange of dialogue between Chas (Ben Stiller) and Richie (Luke Wilson) is some of the most humorous material in the entire film.There's always an easy connection or automatic sense of relatability whenever a film revolves around a family suffering from a father who just doesn't care. When you go through something similar, it just speaks to you more than the average person. The way Royal (Gene Hackman) is so manipulative and a pathological liar along with the way he still feels like his family owed him what he thought he deserved felt very familiar. Royal tries to make up for lost time though and even seems to be doing so by the end of the film. It's always rewarding when a film can end the way you wish your life could.With all of Anderson's trademarks and personal connections aside, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is good but not nearly as great as some of Anderson's other work. Most of the characters felt very similar, which was probably done on purpose since most of them were from the same family and they were all tainted by Royal just not giving a damn about anyone but himself. But none of the performances really pull you in. The quirkiness was there as was Anderson's dry humor; you can't have a Wes Anderson film without either of those.

697728,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0000640VJ,Cubist,"[2, 4]","The Royal Tenenbaums is set to the same wistful, sentimental tone as A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965), but in many respects, the narrative structure of the movie is similar to Wes Anderson's previous film, Rushmore (1998). The latter film was structured like a play yet organized by month, while the former is arranged like a novel, complete with chapter breaks. However, Anderson and his co-screenwriter, Owen Wilson, are much more ambitious with Tenenbaums as they introduce many more protagonists, each with their own storyline. These storylines are distinctive and fully realized to such a degree that the characters develop past their eccentric quirks into emotionally attachable figures.Tenebaums evokes the work of J.D. Salinger and his short stories about the Glass family of genius children who never really grow up. The characters in both Tenenbaums and Salinger's fiction inhabit a mythical New York City that doesn't really exist except in the romantic notions of their respective authors.For all of its literary trappings, The Royal Tenenbaums is also very cinematic in nature. It evokes The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) with the way it introduces the Tenenbaum family (both films even use an omniscient narrator) and also feels like one of Hal Ashby's films -- in particular, Harold and Maude (1971) or Being There (1979). Anderson, like Ashby champions innocent dreamers in a cynical world that threatens to crush them.The first disc is an audio commentary by Wes Anderson and is delivered in his trademark low-key style. He talks about the themes of Tenenbaums, recounts many anecdotes that occurred during the making of the movie and divulges all sorts arcane trivia. This is an informative commentary essential for any fan of Anderson's work.The second disc carries the bulk of the supplemental material. There is a massive collection of stills, a spot-on parody of The Charlie Rose Show, With the Filmmaker, a 27-minute documentary that originally aired on the Independent Film Channel, and a nice collection of interviews with the cast that can be viewed individually or as a whole.The folks at Criterion come through again with this top notch two-DVD set. Presented in a picture-perfect anamorphic transfer with a 5.1 DTS soundtrack and an excellent collection of supplemental material support a fantastic film. The Royal Tenenbaums is of the best movies the year it came out and is Wes Anderson's strongest effort to date. This is an essential purchase for any film buff's collection.",5,another masterpiece from Criterion!,1054252800,"05 30, 2003",2003,2506,"['Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'set', 'same', 'wistful', 'sentimental', 'tone', 'A', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', '1965', 'many', 'respects', 'narrative', 'structure', 'movie', 'similar', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'previous', 'film', 'Rushmore', '1998', 'latter', 'film', 'was', 'structured', 'play', 'yet', 'organized', 'month', 'former', 'arranged', 'novel', 'complete', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'However', 'Anderson', 'co-screenwriter', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'ambitious', 'Tenenbaums', 'introduce', 'many', 'more', 'protagonists', 'own', 'storyline', 'storylines', 'are', 'distinctive', 'fully', 'realized', 'such', 'degree', 'characters', 'develop', 'eccentric', 'quirks', 'emotionally', 'attachable', 'figures.Tenebaums', 'evokes', 'work', 'J.D', 'Salinger', 'short', 'stories', 'Glass', 'family', 'genius', 'children', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'grow', 'up', 'characters', 'Tenenbaums', 'Salinger', 'fiction', 'inhabit', 'mythical', 'New', 'York', 'City', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', 'romantic', 'notions', 'respective', 'literary', 'trappings', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'also', 'very', 'cinematic', 'nature', 'Magnificent', 'Ambersons', '1942', 'way', 'Tenenbaum', 'family', 'films', 'even', 'use', 'omniscient', 'narrator', 'also', 'feels', 'one', 'Hal', 'Ashby', 'films', 'particular', 'Harold', 'Maude', '1971', 'Being', '1979', 'Anderson', 'Ashby', 'champions', 'innocent', 'dreamers', 'cynical', 'world', 'crush', 'them.The', 'first', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'delivered', 'trademark', 'low-key', 'style', 'themes', 'Tenenbaums', 'many', 'anecdotes', 'occurred', 'making', 'movie', 'sorts', 'arcane', 'trivia', 'informative', 'commentary', 'essential', 'fan', 'Anderson', 'work.The', 'second', 'disc', 'bulk', 'supplemental', 'material', 'massive', 'collection', 'stills', 'spot-on', 'parody', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'Show', 'Filmmaker', '27-minute', 'documentary', 'originally', 'aired', 'Independent', 'Film', 'Channel', 'nice', 'collection', 'interviews', 'cast', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'individually', 'whole.The', 'folks', 'Criterion', 'come', 'again', 'top', 'notch', 'two-DVD', 'set', 'Presented', 'picture-perfect', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', '5.1', 'DTS', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'collection', 'supplemental', 'material', 'support', 'fantastic', 'film', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'came', 'out', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'strongest', 'effort', 'date', 'essential', 'purchase', 'film', 'buff', 'collection']",The Royal Tenenbaums
697729,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B0000640VJ,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 3]","Who knew Owen Wilson could write?  I sure didn't, but then I stumbled upon the comedic masterpiece known as `The Royal Tenenbaums' and I was quickly put in my place.  With fantastic work by the entire cast, this film succeeds in becoming a smart, witty and deep comedy that far surpasses what passes today as a good laugh.Gene Hackman does a brilliant job as Royal, prick-father to three genius yet dysfunctional children who decides he wants to make peace with his family and become the father he never was.  His children are splendidly played by Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow.Stiller plays Chas, the athletic financier who buries himself in work to avoid confronting the death of his wife.  He's slowly becoming the father he always hated to his two sons yet he won't accept that and thus refuses to accept his fathers attempt to reconcile.  Wilson plays Richie, the tennis star who hit a slump after his adopted sister Margot marries Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray) and thus becomes somewhat of a hermit.  Paltrow plays Margot, the playwright who's estranged from her family and quite the downer.  Together with their mother Etheline (Anjelica Huston) they make up one of the most eccentric families the screen has ever seen, but they are certainly one of the most entertaining.Along with his sidekick Pagoda (the hilarious Kumar Pallana), Royal tries his hardest to reach his families hearts, albeit going about it in all the wrong ways, but he must contend with Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), Etheline's fianc&eacute;, who is determined to make his efforts fail.  With brilliant performances by the entire cast (Hackman, Paltrow and Stiller stealing most of the show) and a hilarious car crash scene involving family friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) that had me reeling, `The Royal Tenenbaums' is a unique comedy that is sure to please and be remembered for time to come.

Sanderman,"[5, 7]","THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS achieves something that I thought was impossible: to produce a movie containing both Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson that I enjoyed.  It may sound like a joke, but I'm being completely serious.  I normally cannot stand either of these actors because they tend to just play themselves in every movie that they make.  But THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS creates an intelligent enough comedy to prevent them from lapsing into their comedic stupidity.THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS chronicles the sad story of a family of very talented children (Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, & Gwenyth Paltrow) whose lives are torn apart by the parental failings of their father.  Gene Hackman is perfectly cast as the ""Royal"" Tenenbaum, an actor who is perfectly able to portray a man who is both sympathetic and despicable at the same time.  What impressed me about THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is that it manages to send you all over the emotional map.  Rather than just stick to laughs, this film quickly establishes itself as something else entirely.This is a very weird and striking comedy: delightfully hilarious at one moment and disturbingly awkward and depressing the next.  It definitely explores the whole range of human emotion: all eight octaves.  I enjoyed its humor and range; however, it seems  clear to me that viewers will either love it or hate it.  The film leaves room for a variety of interpretations and, while good, it is not good enough to silence those who criticize it for being somewhat awkward.

Give me something different, give me something unique that goes out on the edge.  From the first frame, Wes Anderson tells his story in a unique way.  Also know that the movie is not always comic.CHAPTER 3...  It is easy to look at the track suits, and the costumes and they think that this is going to be a riot.  This is a film about family and genius....eccentric, wise and true to it's world.  Yes, comic things happen(In some ways it reminded me of John Irving's Hotel New Hampshire) but they come from a character based heart. CHAPTER 4... I think alot of negative stuff comes from the fact that something happens that we have never seen before, the film isn't what we expected and so we deem it boring.  This is exactly why I loved it.  Give me the unique and interesting.....Also, with the DVD Anderson comes off extremely well.  Smart, funny, calm, really well versed in film, and completely visionary.  And it shows...CHAPTER 5...the performances are exemplary(Tell me another person who could've pulled this off like Gene Hackman.)...and the vision is uncompromising..........EPILOGUE...So, there it is.

It was nice to see Ben Stiller playing a regular guy instead of the screwball characters he usually plays.  Gene Hackman was definitely the highlight of the film for me.  Royal Tenenbaum is a wonderfully slimy character when we meet him, but it is nice to see him change a bit later in the film and redeem himself.  The three Tenenbaum children seem a tad bit too exceptional.  Perhaps it would have been better if one of them had been ordinary.  Still, I did enjoy them, even though I didn't connect with them like I did with Royal.  The film is brilliantly shot and well executed.  I like the fact that the humor is dark, and subtle, unlike many comedies that sledge hammer one with their humor.The DVD is nice, with a thoughtful commentary on disc 1 and then leaving disc 2 for all of the extras and it is packed with them, including interviews with cast, outtakes, galleries of the art in the film, and an Independent Film Channel Documentary.  It is great that Criterion has done the only DVD release, rather than Touchstone doing a Vanilla DVD & Criterion doing the Special Edition, as was done with Rushmore.  The packaging is a nice compromise.  The outside sleeve is a photographic cover, which Touchstone probably wanted, but the actual DVD case has the artwork of Eric Anderson, which is in the same style as the Criterion Rushmore cover.  The booklet inside is informative and thoughtfully written. There is also a wonderful insert that gives a layout of each room in the Tenenbaum house, similar to the map in the Rushmore package which had a map highlighting the important places in the film.A great package which I'm sure will have Blockbuster cringing as they don't normally carry Criterion collection versions of films.  This release obviously has the financial backing of Touchstone as it is much cheaper than other Criterion titles.Recommended.",4,A Royal Treat...,1026259200,"07 10, 2002",2002,2005,"['friend', 'took', 'film', 'theater', 'birthday', 'was', 'best', 'present', 'got.All', 'performances', 'were', 'really', 'terrific', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'playing', 'regular', 'guy', 'instead', 'screwball', 'characters', 'usually', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'was', 'definitely', 'highlight', 'film', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'wonderfully', 'slimy', 'character', 'when', 'meet', 'nice', 'see', 'change', 'bit', 'later', 'film', 'redeem', 'three', 'Tenenbaum', 'children', 'seem', 'tad', 'bit', 'too', 'exceptional', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'one', 'had', 'been', 'ordinary', 'Still', 'did', 'enjoy', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'connect', 'did', 'Royal', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'shot', 'well', 'executed', 'fact', 'humor', 'dark', 'subtle', 'many', 'comedies', 'sledge', 'hammer', 'one', 'humor.The', 'DVD', 'nice', 'thoughtful', 'commentary', 'disc', '1', 'then', 'leaving', 'disc', '2', 'extras', 'packed', 'including', 'interviews', 'cast', 'outtakes', 'galleries', 'art', 'film', 'Independent', 'Film', 'Channel', 'Documentary', 'great', 'Criterion', 'done', 'only', 'DVD', 'release', 'rather', 'Touchstone', 'doing', 'Vanilla', 'DVD', 'Criterion', 'doing', 'Special', 'Edition', 'was', 'done', 'Rushmore', 'packaging', 'nice', 'compromise', 'outside', 'sleeve', 'photographic', 'cover', 'Touchstone', 'probably', 'wanted', 'actual', 'DVD', 'case', 'artwork', 'Eric', 'Anderson', 'same', 'style', 'Criterion', 'Rushmore', 'cover', 'booklet', 'inside', 'informative', 'thoughtfully', 'written', 'also', 'wonderful', 'insert', 'layout', 'room', 'Tenenbaum', 'house', 'similar', 'map', 'Rushmore', 'package', 'had', 'map', 'highlighting', 'important', 'places', 'film.A', 'great', 'package', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'have', 'Blockbuster', 'cringing', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'carry', 'Criterion', 'collection', 'versions', 'films', 'release', 'obviously', 'financial', 'backing', 'Touchstone', 'much', 'cheaper', 'other', 'Criterion', 'titles.Recommended']",The Royal Tenenbaums

Wes Anderson is an original artist in a world full of sequels and spinoffs of comic books and TV shows.  That he attracts first-rate casts to help him realize a vision says plenty about Anderson's talent.  Gene Hackman is at the top of any credible list of ""World's Great Actors,"" and he gives what seems like his 100th superb performance here.  As the central figure of the movie Hackman has a lot on his shoulders and he carries it off with style, timing, and heart.  The other standouts in the cast are Danny Glover and Anjelica Huston, but really, the movie works best as an ensemble piece: these folks have great chemistry together on screen and they help Anderson (and cowriter Owen Wilson) realize his vision.  In addition to being creative and funny, sometimes in an unexpected and silly way, the film is emotionally moving at several points, most of them involving Hackman.  The montage with Gwyneth Paltrow growing up as a girl who likes her cigarettes and her men (and women!) is wonderful on its own, but Bill Murray's reaction to it takes the scene to the level of priceless.  On the down side, the movie's visual style and structure often are contrived and the style draws too much attention to itself, but these are the flaws of someone learning to develop a vision.  Anderson enjoys movies and moviemaking, and we enjoy his enthusiasm as he scores key scenes with well-known and not-so-well known music.  My favorite: using Bob Dylan's instrumental from the Sam Peckinpah film ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" for the sequence in which cheeseburger-eating-stomach-cancer-faker Royal (Hackman) gets booted from the Tenenbaum residence.  Some might say Anderson is self-indulgent; I think he enjoys popular culture and people and does a fine job of helping his audience share the enjoyment.  Now, for the extras: outstanding.  Major cast members get interviewed, there are some choice outtakes and a few surprises, and even the covers of books that the characters in this very text-oriented movie have written (for example, ""Old Custer"" by Owen Wilson's character Eli Cash, a bestselling author with elements of Tom Wolfe, Hunter Thompson, Richard Brautigan, and others thrown in.).  In sum, Royal Tenenbaums documents the emergence of a potentially great director, Wes Anderson.  His humor and perspective will not work for everyone, and certain elements of the film feel like inside jokes for those who were involved, but the movie will hold up on repeated viewings.  It will also stand as one of the movies that shows Gene Hackman's skills to great effect, and that's saying a lot considering his track record.  The Hack-Man puts on a clinic in acting that expresses the symbiosis of hilarity and tragedy that we know as real life.",4,An Emerging Great Director?,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,2854,"['waited', 'long', 'time', 'release', 'film', 'finally', 'see', 'wish', ""'d"", 'looked', 'sooner', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'original', 'artist', 'world', 'full', 'sequels', 'spinoffs', 'comic', 'books', 'TV', 'shows', 'first-rate', 'casts', 'help', 'realize', 'vision', 'plenty', 'Anderson', 'talent', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'top', 'credible', 'list', 'World', 'Great', 'Actors', 'what', '100th', 'superb', 'performance', 'here', 'central', 'figure', 'movie', 'Hackman', 'lot', 'shoulders', 'off', 'style', 'timing', 'heart', 'other', 'standouts', 'cast', 'are', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'really', 'movie', 'best', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'folks', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'screen', 'help', 'Anderson', 'cowriter', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'realize', 'vision', 'addition', 'being', 'creative', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'unexpected', 'silly', 'way', 'film', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'several', 'points', 'most', 'involving', 'Hackman', 'montage', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'growing', 'up', 'girl', 'who', 'cigarettes', 'men', 'women', 'wonderful', 'own', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'reaction', 'scene', 'level', 'priceless', 'down', 'side', 'movie', 'visual', 'style', 'structure', 'often', 'are', 'contrived', 'style', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'are', 'flaws', 'someone', 'learning', 'develop', 'vision', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'moviemaking', 'enjoy', 'enthusiasm', 'key', 'scenes', 'well-known', 'not-so-well', 'known', 'music', 'favorite', 'using', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'instrumental', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'film', 'Pat', 'Garrett', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'sequence', 'cheeseburger-eating-stomach-cancer-faker', 'Royal', 'Hackman', 'booted', 'Tenenbaum', 'residence', 'might', 'say', 'Anderson', 'self-indulgent', 'think', 'popular', 'culture', 'people', 'fine', 'job', 'helping', 'audience', 'share', 'enjoyment', 'Now', 'extras', 'outstanding', 'Major', 'cast', 'members', 'get', 'interviewed', 'are', 'choice', 'outtakes', 'few', 'surprises', 'even', 'covers', 'books', 'characters', 'very', 'text-oriented', 'movie', 'have', 'written', 'example', 'Old', 'Custer', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'character', 'Eli', 'Cash', 'bestselling', 'author', 'elements', 'Tom', 'Wolfe', 'Hunter', 'Thompson', 'Richard', 'Brautigan', 'others', 'thrown', 'in.', 'sum', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'documents', 'emergence', 'potentially', 'great', 'director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'humor', 'perspective', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'everyone', 'certain', 'elements', 'film', 'feel', 'inside', 'jokes', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'movie', 'will', 'hold', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'will', 'also', 'stand', 'one', 'movies', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'skills', 'great', 'effect', 'saying', 'lot', 'considering', 'track', 'record', 'Hack-Man', 'clinic', 'acting', 'symbiosis', 'hilarity', 'tragedy', 'know', 'real', 'life']",The Royal Tenenbaums

There is nothing remotely appealing in the characters; in fact, neither my wife nor I cared one iota for any of them.  And we could easly do without elongated narration of very boring material.

697750,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0000640VJ,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[30, 72]","Ye gods. What a wretchedly bad, bad, bad, bad, tedious, tedious, tedious movie. Why did people like it? (Or... did they??) This flick is such a shamblesome, interminable, wanky waste of time and talent... Whoever ordained director Wes Anderson as an auteur probably regrets it now: the most remarkable thing about him is his immense hubris in baldly recycling all the strained humor of the ""wacky"" counterculture comedies of the last four decades, and condensing it into one, horribly dull, overlong film. I mean, look, I really do ""get"" that the whole point of this style of humor lies in its excessiveness; but that doesn't mean that everything the director does is instantly going to be ""good""... and this trainwreck of a film is definitely NOT GOOD. Anderson's directorial philosophy seems to be make it funny -- no, wait: even funnier -- by constantly upping the ante... Every single detail of the film has to be odd, quirky, off-center, out there and bizarre. The technique is so mannered and predictable that it's incredibly boring. Couldn't he have worked on the plot, or the premise, or the acting, instead of his own insatiable uber-cleverness? Besides, wasn't this film a disaster before, when they made it as ""Hotel New Hampshire?"" Perhaps I wouldn't have been so turned off had it not been for all the...packaging on the DVD copy I rented -- I mean, really... a 2-CD set deluxe set complete with an entire extra disc of ""bonus"" material?

697751,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B0000640VJ,D. Litton,"[15, 22]","Three words come to mind when trying to describe Wes Anderson's &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; in a positive manner: quirky, witty, and delightful. I also have three words for the film: long, laborious, and quirky (I say quirky twice because it works for and against the movie). As an exercise in subtle humor and acting zeal, Anderson's much-anticipated follow-up to his acclaimed &quot;Rushmore&quot; hits all the rights notes, but his style and storytelling are hit-and-miss, and the slight moments of comedic brilliance are few and far between.If for nothing else, you must see &quot;Tenenbaums&quot; for its terrific cast, led by Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum, the matriarch of a family destined for dysfunction from the minute he said &quot;I do.&quot; The movie begins with his divorce from his wife, Etheline (Anjelica Houston), which has some serious effects on his already-otherworldly children, Chas, Richie, and Margot, the adopted daughter whom Royal sees fit to disclude from major family events. As the children grow in the education-oriented household of their mother, they go on to become great successes in their time, eventually going their separate ways into adulthood.Picking up many years later, everyone is much older, and things have changed. Margot has lost touch with her play-writing ability and confines herself in the bathroom endless hours of the day. Chas sees it fit to hold emergency fire drills for his two children as a result of the death of his wife. Richie has been sailing around the world, all the while thinking of Margot and falling in love with her. Ethel is on the brink of marriage to her business partner, Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), and Royal is flat broke and in need of a place to stay.I must say, I think this is probably the best ensemble cast for a movie since Paul Thomas Anderson's &quot;Magnolia.&quot; Hackman is anything but lacking in his performance as a man who knows exactly how his family and friends feel about him, and doesn't give a second thought to it. He has a delightful way with words that makes Royal a real treat to watch, adding small touches of comedy to scenes that would otherwise be melodramatic. His scenes with the equally brilliant Houston are funny and engaging; Houston, after a somewhat lengthy absence from the screen, manages to employ a real sense of motherhood in her character, the kind of warmth and quirkiness that one easily warms to.As adults, the Tenenbaum children are played by Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Stiller, as Chas, exacts a frantic sense of paranoia that will later become the tie that binds him with his father, and carries it off with humor and zeal intact. Wilson, as Richie, is kind and caring, seeing people for their good rather than their bad; as Royal's sole companion throughout much of the film, he will try to use this to keep his family together. As Margot, Paltrow almost steals the show all for herself, playing her character's depression and restrained angst in a manner that brings to mind Thora Birch's character in &quot;Ghost World.&quot;The story hook comes when Royal announces his impending death, which gives him cause to seek out his family and reconcile with them within the six weeks he has been given to live. Of course, we soon know he is not really dying, but the change in him as a result of being surrounded by his family is quite evident, and his quest takes on a greater meaning. All the while, each of the characters is subjected to some part of their past, or their present fears and inhibitions, and must learn to realize them, face them, and overcome them. This allows the cast to really show audiences what they are made of, accepting the challenge of portraying each Tenenbaum's personal struggle realistically; of course, they succeed in doing so.This is all done in an absolutely off-the-wall approach by director Wes Anderson, who employs such an offbeat feel that it almost becomes unbearable. I was tickled by the fact that no one hardly ever changes clothes throughout the movie... Paltrow with her single red hair clip, Luke Wilson with his headband and sunglasses. The opening credits and title sequences, the music (including the classic Peanuts' theme &quot;Christmastime Is Here&quot;), all strive to elevate the movie to a magical level, but the heavy reliance on quirkiness, as well as a stark absence of continuous comedy, all seems to overpower the potential that it has. It uses the wit of its cast to its advantage, but there is nothing within the story that will provoke a guffaw instead of a mere grin or a chuckle here and there.Looking back on &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums,&quot; I realize that my reservations about the movie are my own fault: I expected too much in terms of outright humor. The laughs here is subtle, which is a tough pill to swallow at times, especially when the material shows great comedic potential. Overall, I enjoyed the movie for much of its dry humor, its strong characterization, and its wonderful use of such a brilliant cast.",4,A cast fit for a king.,1011312000,"01 18,

Why it wasn't nominated for more than Best Original Screenplay at this year's Oscars is beyond me. The same went for his sophomore effort (and what I feel is his best film of the three) ""Rushmore.""One of many of Anderson's gifts lies in his appreciation of and ability to identify deadpan humor. My three favorite moments of the film are when Richie suffers a breakdown at his tennis match and tosses his racquet at the returned ball he lightly served over the net in the first place, when Chas holds a mock fire drill and tells his boys that they all would have died, including their dog, because it took them four and a half minutes to get out of the house, and when Raleigh St. Clair replies to the question ""Can the boy tell time?"" with ""Heavens, no.""He also has the uncanny ability of accompanying his films with the perfect music (though he has been ostracized for not including certain songs that appear in his films on the actual soundtrack.) He did it in ""Rushmore"" with British Invasion songs and he doesn't falter here. The absolute best moment of the film (in a depressing, psychotic kind of way) is when Richie attempts to kill himself by slicing his wrists. The reason for this wholly rests on the fact that the entire montage was accompanied by Elliot Smith's haunting song ""Needle in the Hay.""The other reason Anderson gets good marks is because of the fabulous ensemble cast. Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Danny Glover, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bill Murray, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson are all at their best here.Kudos to everyone involved in this film; it is sure to gain classic status years from now.

the upcoming The Third Wheel,and Old School)I knew that it would be the best.I did see it and I saw it twice.I enjoyed everything about it.The Story:Royal Tenenbaum(Gene Hackmen)and his wife Etheline Tenenbaum(Angelic Huston) bought the house on 111 Archer Avenue and had three children before they sperated.Chas Tenenbaum(Ben Stiller)was a bunisskid who understood everything about the value of a dollar.Margot Tenenbaum(Gwen Palthrow)was a playwright and won the Poultzter Prize in the 9th Grade.Her first play was preformed on her 11th birthday the last time she ever saw or spoke to Royal.Richie Tenenbaum(Luke Wilson)was a tennie champ and went pro at 17 years of age.He ran away with Margot one winter and has loved her ever since.She was adopted at age 2 so it's ""not wrong really.""He has a friend who lives with his aunt in a two room apartment.His name is Eli Cash(Owen Wilson).27 years later Chas married a women named Racheal and had too sons named Ari(Grant Rosenmeyer) and Ozi(Johan Meyerson).They had a dog named Buckly.Rachel died in a car crash the summer before the story starts.Ever since Chas has been abessed with safty.Margot has married a man named Desmond and divorced after nine days.Later she married the writer Raleign St.Clair(Bill Murrey)who does experements on a child named Dudley.Margot is having an affair with Eli who has become a writer and a cowboy.Richie quit tennis and has been trying to get rid of his love for Margot by riding on an oceanliner.Etheline has become an arceologist and has become an item with her accountent and bridge partner Henry Sherman.Henry asks Etheline to marry him and she thinks about it.Royal has been living in the Lindberg Palace Hotel for 27 years.He is still a cheat but is broke and is still in love with his ex.He fakes stomach cancer so he could woo her over and get a place to live with his friend and ex housekeeper Pagoda(Kumar Pallena).His other only friend is Dusty(Semyor Cassel)who is an elevator operator at the hotel.Now all the Tenenbaum children are under one roof in this dark comendy directed by the genius Wes Anderson.The Score:Mark Mothersburgh composed a great score for The Royal Tenenbaums.Score Selection are 111 Archie Avenue,Lindberg Palce Hotel Suite,Look at That Old Grizzly Bears,Mothersburgh Cannon,Scrapping and Yelling,Pagoda's Theme,I Always Wanted to be a Tenenbaum,Racheal Evens Tenenbaum(1965-2000),and Sparkplug Minute.The Writer:Owen Wilson continued to help Wes Anderson write the script to The Royal Tenenbaums.The Narractor:The narractor is never really the main part of a film but without one here the story of the Tenenbaum children cannot not be told so I put a special section for Alec Baldwin(Beetlejuice,Pearl Harbor,and an episode of

If you prefer clever dialogue, smart acting, and a more European or independent approach to comedy, you may like this film.  Look at it this way, Criterion is well-known for putting out solid DVDs on quality foreign films which may not always be to the general public's taste but have been shown over time to be influential or very good in their own right.  Well, Criterion released this Disney film on DVD, so that pretty much says it all.The film is basically about a dysfunctional family, headed by the long-in-exile father Gene Hackman.  Now, he wants to work his way back into the family's good graces when he learns that his wife (they never divorced) wants to marry another man.  Sounds like the setting for a typical French comedy, so if you approach the film that way, you'll enjoy it just fine.  Like me.  Never saw it in the theaters, just bought it on a total whim, and enjoyed it very much.  The cast is great - I loved Paltrow's Tuesday Addams impression, and the Bjorn Borgish family member's tennis meltdown is waaay funny in a classy way.One last word - I especially like the &quot;Peter Bradley&quot; interview on the extras DVD.  It looks and feels like a real and serious PBS-type interview with cast members, but the sheer incompetence of the questions and answers (nothing outrageous, just hilarious in context) is classic.

His movies have always been strange, as Bottle Rocket and Rushmore can attest to.  But they have been both funny and dramatic.  They didn't seem like Anderson was trying too hard.  This movie reeks of writing not translating to the screen.  I can imagine the script really did look excellent on paper, and if I had read it I probably would have chuckled.  But the movie comes off haphazardly, and the jokes just aren't funny.  It's not that his movies have been laugh-out loud funny, but they are amusing.  Royal Tenenbaums is just weird.  People are giving him too much credit, different or weird doesn't mean it's good.  The acting is all great, the characters are typically eccentric, the situations extreme.

697760,A15TNUM2PBS6F0,B0000640VJ,"Ei ""crzybookmoovielover""","[1, 4]","This movie is the third of Director Wes Anderson's, who co-wrote it with Owen Wilson.  Owen is also in the movie as the neighbor who invites himself over, and grows up to be a druggie.I loved Rushmore, which was the second movie, and I also was very fond of Bottle Rocket. TRT is not like either of these movies.  It was funny in some respect, but it was just far too dark and dreary to have the same affect on the viewer that Rushmore did. I did like the way that the film was directed, the cinematography, costuming, and the way the story was told -- as if it were a book or a play.  That part was original.I also thought that some of the acting was just wonderful especially by Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum. You don't know whether or not to like his character, but he is the only character that really made me laugh. As usual, The Owen Brothers, Luke and Owen are both very good.  It was nice to see Luke not playing ""the straight/nice guy"".  His character, Richie, was a little on the dark side, and it was a refreshing yet somewhat odd change for him.  The rest of the actors were all very good, I just think that Luke Wilson and Gene Hackman were in the best form.  Gwyneth Paltrow(playing the adopted smoking sister), Ben Stiller(playing the uptight/angry businessman brother), Angelica Huston(playing the mother and the glue that holds the family together, and Danny Glover(playing Hustons' new love interest) also appear in this film.The film itself is a drama that has comedy peppered in at opportune moments.  I don't think everyone is going to laugh at this movie.  In previews it looks like comedy, but it is more dramatic, and depressing and dark at times.  There have been so many movies made about families with dysfunction in them, and I think that the creators of the movie really try to bring some originality out of it.  It's a good effort on their part, but I don't think it is the best.  The soundtrack is also very good, as it was in ""Rushmore"".While this certainly isn't the cheeriest of films, it has great ensemble acting and an fresh perspective into the look of the dysfunctional family.",3,The Royal Tenenbaums,1012262400,"01 29, 2002",2002,2118,"['movie', 'third', 'Director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Owen', 'also', 'movie', 'neighbor', 'who', 'up', 'be', 'druggie.I', 'loved', 'Rushmore', 'was', 'second', 'movie', 'also', 'was', 'very', 'fond', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'TRT', 'not', 'movies', 'was', 'funny', 'respect', 'was', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'dark', 'dreary', 'have', 'same', 'affect', 'viewer', 'Rushmore', 'did', 'did', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'cinematography', 'costuming', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'were', 'book', 'play', 'part', 'was', 'original.I', 'also', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'like', 'character', 'only', 'character', 'really', 'made', 'laugh', 'usual', 'Owen', 'Brothers', 'Luke', 'Owen', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Luke', 'not', 'playing', 'straight/nice', 'guy', 'character', 'Richie', 'was', 'little', 'dark', 'side', 'was', 'refreshing', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'change', 'rest', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'just', 'think', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'were', 'best', 'form', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'playing', 'adopted', 'smoking', 'sister', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'playing', 'uptight/angry', 'businessman', 'brother', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'playing', 'mother', 'glue', 'family', 'together', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'playing', 'Hustons', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'also', 'appear', 'film.The', 'film', 'drama', 'comedy', 'peppered', 'opportune', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'everyone', 'going', 'laugh', 'movie', 'previews', 'comedy', 'more', 'dramatic', 'depressing', 'dark', 'times', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'made', 'families', 'dysfunction', 'think', 'creators', 'movie', 'really', 'try', 'bring', 'originality', 'good', 'effort', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'best', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'Rushmore', '.While', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'cheeriest', 'films', 'great', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'look', 'dysfunctional', 'family']",The Royal Tenenbaums

Directed by Anderson this film has a wonderful touch with an all-star Hollywood cast (Gene Hackman, Angelica Houston, the Wilson brothers-Owen & Luke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Bill Murray and Danny Glover) with the combination of Anderson regulars.  The style that Anderson shoots is just so intriguing to watch.  Things are constantly appealing, the scenes, the movement, and the background action.  ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is pure witty humor at its finest.  The cast is just outstanding, all the character parts were sensational.  Anderson really is a genius at work, this movie is really that good.  The soundtrack is also one of the best I've heard in a while, the music really blends with the picture and gives the right atmosphere to the scenes.If you've seen either of the previous Wilson/Anderson works-""Bottle Rocket"" & ""Rushmore"" you'll love this film.

Whether you're on the side that loves it or the side that was mostly bored with it, you'll probably think it's a weird movie.I didn't think it was weird, though I thought it was slow. After watching this movie and seeing all the rave reviews, I would've loved to have watched it with someone who actually laughed throughout the movie, just to see where it was supposed to be funny. When scenes were introduced showing potentially uncomfortable situations between the characters, like when the adopted sister confronts her brother about him being in love with her, she confronts him, and then we get a scene change, and we're left wondering what was said between the two. Maybe we're supposed to use our imagination, but I think that's a cheap way out. A pack of cigarettes drops out of her coat pocket. Her brother asks her about it. She says it's not hers, he says they fell out of her pocket, and again we cut away to another scene and we never return to that one. ""You dropped your cigarettes"". ""Those aren't mine"". ""They fell out of your pocket"". And the scene goes away.If this is the funny dialogue, it didn't work for me. I don't get how it worked for anybody.A handful of times I laughed out loud. Just as many times, I felt like turning off the movie. By the end, though I was involved in the movie, I felt like it was a waste of time. I was a little touched by Chas at the end.

Given its insufferable air of twerpy self-adoration, one is less inclined to itemize its numerous inadequacies than to simply beat it up after school. Unless you're desperate to pass yourself off as some kind of hipster, avoid this at all costs.That eminent philosopher, David Lee Roth, once explained that the reason music reviewers rave over Elvis Costello records is that music reviewers all *look* like Elvis Costello. I suspect a similar dynamic applies in this case. A person who writes about movies for a living is likely to have been an art-geek in high school, erotically fixated on his female siblings as an unthreatening alternative to pursuing available girls, cultivating his semi-ironic taste in pop culture into a hermetic language with which to keep the pain of unpopularity at bay - all of which are traits glorified in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". It's not so much that I begrudge Wes Anderson his naked wish fulfillment; creative people in many fields do it all the time.

Probably the only reason I saw it was I loved Wes Anderson films. This is possibly his greatest. The storyenvolves Royal  an uptight, ornery man whose children are amazing (Ben Stiller playes Chas Tenenbaum, a stock market expert who started buying real estate in his teens, Margot Tenenbaum (Gwynneth Paltrow) is an acclaimed playright who won a Pulitzer Pized at the age of 9 (She is adopted, though). Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson) was a tennis player in the top ten rankings in America at one point. There dad is very mean though (played brilliantly by Gene Hackman). When the kids grow up, they all start to be very starnge and different. Chas, who's wife has died is a safety freak. Margots plays are actually worse than when she was nine. She is married to a character played by Bill Murray. Richie broke down in a tennis game and turns to be suicidal. This is actually a funny film, yet a dark comedy. Owen Wilson, who plays a very weird Eli Cash, is director Wes Andersons co-writer.  The film has some perfect scenes-and here they are:1. ""Cast of Characters""2.  ""Me and Julio Down By The Schoolyard""3. ""Needle in the Hay""The dvd is criterion, so you know that it's very good. It has a director approved transfer, 5.1, commentary just by Wes Anderson (its only okay; many people think Richies breakdown tennis scenes commentators are his brother, a different Wilson (not Owen), and Jason Scwartzman, from Wes's previous film, Rushmore, which, by the way, has an excellent criterion collection.

697772,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B0000640VJ,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 5]","I finished this film scratching my head over the raves I've been hearing about it.  The cast is terrific, but the material is quite mediocre as was the box office.  I can only assume that Wes Anderson's dark, straight faced comedy must really have found a niche that is starved for this style of humor.This is a film that pretends to take itself very seriously while delivering one absurd situation after another.  There is something cleverly ironic about that, but mostly the film is too serious to be funny and too weird to be melodramatic.  It really fails to identify itself.  It might be viewed as a lampoon of wealth, power and wunderkinds, but it lacks the satirical punch to succeed in that vein.The acting is delightful given the material with which they had to work.  The ensemble is brimming with notables, all of whom are at the top of their game.  Gene Hackman is a good choice for Royal.  Hackman is an accomplished dramatic and comedic actor and he was the best of the cast members at walking the line between earnestness and the inanity required by the script.  Anjelica Huston seems almost like she can't believe she is saying some of the lines she is given, delivering half of them fighting to hold back a grin a mile wide.  Ben Stiller does a nice job of portraying the neurotic widower and father hater, obsessed with the safety of his kids.  Luke Wilson comes closest to delivering a believable character, playing the highly eccentric former tennis star that had a nervous collapse over the love of his adopted sister.  Luke's brother Owen Wilson is far less funny in this film than in others I've seen, but in his defense, he didn't have a lot with which to work.  Gwyneth Paltrow abandons her normally sweet demeanor and does a nice rendition of the psychologically troubled Margot, complete with despondent personality, blank stare and a variety of nervous habits.  Bill Murray and Danny Glover round out the cast in minor roles that amount to little more than cameos.This is one of those films that you either love it or you can't connect.  I couldn't find enough meat to classify it as much better than fair.  I rated it 6/10.

A few came close, but this is the film I was waiting for the whole time! Most dark comedies usually take place all at night, which is fun for a while, but gets old. Just because a movie has a twisted sense of humor, doesn't mean it has to be night all the time! This is the movie that steps aside and says, ""Like me for what I am. I'm different.""The whole cast shines in the film that finally fufills dark comedy lovers. I don't recall a single scene that is dark, the whole film is presented in bright, beautiful pastels. It's certainly not for everyone, it is more than twisted. It makes you laugh and cry without trying. My personal favorite character was Chas (Ben Stiller) not just because I like him as an actor, but because his charcter had so much depth and layers. Although, I'm not saying anything bad about everybody else.The DVD is just what the film deserved...bulky, beautiful, and loaded with extras. We get the full widescreen here, not some cheap immitation. Everything is great, and I have absolutely nothing to complain about. When this film was originally released, I had wanted to see it, but never got around to doing so. I would actually like to thank Daniel Radcliffe (a.k.a. Harry Potter) for reccomending this, because I had forgotten all about it. It's a shame this movie wasn't all that big. Definitely a love-it or hate-it movie.

This time the film was co-written with Owen Wilson.A dandy home on the corner of a NYC residential block is where Royal Tenenbaum resides. He, the patriarch of the family and his wife Ethel, (Anjelica Huston) live each on separate floors of the home.  All of Tenebaum's children are gifted...so much so that the mother, Ethel writes a novel of her life with the young prodigies.Why so smart? Is it the isolation between the children or their parents? Or are they just plain gifted?Chas Tenenbaum, (Ben Stiller) is a financial wizard...buying real estate from the age of 12.Margot Tenenbaum, (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a prize winning playwright as a young girl.Finally, we have Richie, (Luke Wilson) a child prodigy of tennis.These are the Tenenbaum children.  We see them in their habitats. We watch them as if they are goldfish swimming in individual tanks.  Each child has an extreme personality and each child is utterly independent from the family as a whole.One day the family dynamics change forever. Royal, (Gene Hackman) decides he must leave.  For the next twenty years or so life progresses without a father.  The children grow up..each becoming a dehydrated model of what they once were.But each Tenenbaum child also becomes ordinary...Margot marries a man who knows nothing of her (played by Bill Murray).  He doesn't even know she smokes.  Her days of writing plays over.Chas, the financial wizard grows into a red, jumpsuit-wearing father of two, who lost his wife in an accident.  He is also a paranoid safety phobic.Richie lost the tennis match of his life and hides behind long hair and a beard as an adult.Each Tenenbaum kid seems to have a few OCD's.Fun begins when Royal Tenebaum is broke, living away from home so long that he pioneers a plot to win back his family's affections. He pretends to have cancer.  They don't believe him, nor do they care...but Royal moves back in the home with bad timing. His wife wants to remarry...she has fallen in love with Henry Sherman, (Danny Glover) who was her former accountant.  One by one the Tenenbaum children migrate back to the home they grew up in.The entire story is narrated by Alec Baldwin.Each character is so detailed and developed it's kind of creepy.  The movie oozes bottom-of-the-barrel-humor.  A dry comedy with fabulous imagination.Some scenes make me laugh and others become quite serious and I laugh too.  I ask myself ""Am I sick for finding this funny?""I think that is the point.The movie is strange enough to annoy some movie-goers, but grab the rare few who decide not to HAVE to ""get it"".It's like watching ""Vanilla Sky""... a great movie, but relax and enjoy..don't ponder too much, or you miss the finer elements.I enjoyed the Royal Tenenbaums with all their dysfunctional weirdness and quirks...and I must say this may be the performance of a lifetime for Gene Hackman.",5,Dysfunctional Fun,1032220800,"09 17, 2002",2002,2993,"['***The', 'Rise', 'Fall', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums***', 'rise', 'again', '.Another', 'masterpiece', 'humor', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'who', 'brought', 'Rushmore', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'co-written', 'Owen', 'Wilson.A', 'home', 'corner', 'NYC', 'residential', 'block', 'where', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'resides', 'patriarch', 'family', 'wife', 'Ethel', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'live', 'separate', 'floors', 'home', 'Tenebaum', 'children', 'are', 'gifted', 'so', 'much', 'mother', 'Ethel', 'novel', 'life', 'young', 'prodigies.Why', 'smart', 'isolation', 'children', 'parents', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'gifted', 'Chas', 'Tenenbaum', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'financial', 'wizard', 'buying', 'real', 'estate', 'age', '12.Margot', 'Tenenbaum', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'prize', 'winning', 'playwright', 'young', 'girl.Finally', 'have', 'Richie', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'child', 'prodigy', 'tennis.These', 'are', 'Tenenbaum', 'children', 'see', 'habitats', 'watch', 'are', 'goldfish', 'swimming', 'individual', 'tanks', 'child', 'extreme', 'personality', 'child', 'utterly', 'independent', 'family', 'whole.One', 'day', 'family', 'dynamics', 'change', 'forever', 'Royal', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'must', 'leave', 'next', 'twenty', 'years', 'so', 'life', 'father', 'children', 'grow', 'up..each', 'becoming', 'dehydrated', 'model', 'what', 'once', 'were.But', 'Tenenbaum', 'child', 'also', 'ordinary', 'Margot', 'man', 'who', 'nothing', 'played', 'Bill', 'Murray', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'smokes', 'days', 'writing', 'plays', 'over.Chas', 'financial', 'wizard', 'red', 'jumpsuit-wearing', 'father', 'two', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'accident', 'also', 'paranoid', 'safety', 'phobic.Richie', 'lost', 'tennis', 'match', 'life', 'hides', 'long', 'hair', 'beard', 'adult.Each', 'Tenenbaum', 'kid', 'have', 'few', ""OCD's.Fun"", 'when', 'Royal', 'Tenebaum', 'broke', 'living', 'away', 'home', 'so', 'long', 'plot', 'win', 'back', 'family', 'affections', 'have', 'cancer', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'do', 'care', 'Royal', 'back', 'home', 'bad', 'timing', 'wife', 'remarry', 'fallen', 'love', 'Henry', 'Sherman', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'who', 'was', 'former', 'accountant', 'One', 'one', 'Tenenbaum', 'children', 'migrate', 'back', 'home', 'grew', 'up', 'in.The', 'entire', 'story', 'narrated', 'Alec', 'Baldwin.Each', 'character', 'so', 'detailed', 'developed', 'kind', 'creepy', 'movie', 'bottom-of-the-barrel-humor', 'dry', 'comedy', 'fabulous', 'imagination.Some', 'scenes', 'make', 'others', 'become', 'quite', 'serious', 'laugh', 'too', 'ask', 'Am', 'sick', 'finding', 'funny', 'think', 'point.The', 'movie', 'strange', 'enough', 'annoy', 'movie-goers', 'grab', 'rare', 'few', 'who', 'decide', 'not', 'HAVE', 'get', 'watching', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'great', 'movie', 'relax', 'enjoy..do', ""n't"", 'ponder', 'too', 'much', 'miss', 'finer', 'enjoyed', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'dysfunctional', 'weirdness', 'quirks', 'must', 'say', 'may', 'be', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Gene', 'Hackman']",The Royal Tenenbaums

He had just directed two wildly popular indie films ('Bottle Rocket' and 'Rushmore') and wanted to do something big. With a big ensemble cast and a better budget, Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson have delivered the funniest movie in years, and one that will definately be remembered.Royal Tenenbaum (played with pinache by Gene Hackman) has spent the last 22 years of his life in a hotel after an ugly seperation from his wife, Etheline (Anjelica Huston). Etheline raised their kids in the house at 111 Archer Avenue with strange results; the children are brilliant, if not a bit eccentric. Chas was buying and selling real estate in his early teens, Margot (the adopted one) wrote successful plays and got a $50,000 grant in the 9th grade, and Richie was a tennis pro at a very young age.Years later, after Chas' (Ben Stiller) wife dies in a plane crash that he survived, he moves back to the house at 111 Archer with his mother. When Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) hears of this, she moves back as well, as she's unhappy with her marriage to the neurologist Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray). Richie (Luke Wilson), who has been traveling abroad on a cruise ship for many years, returns home also. Even childhood friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) comes back.When Royal hears that everyone is back together, he wants to get to know them and make amends for his past inadequacies. This is not an easy thing, because the whole family (with the exception of Richie) distrusts him. So, he lies to Etheline and tells her that he is dying, and wants to spend the last 6 weeks of his life with the children. Chaos (and subsequent hilarity) ensues when Etheline's latest suitor, accountant Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), exposes Royal as a fraud.This is in all actuality a dark comedy. There are several references to death and even a graphic suicide attempt. You're asking yourself, 'how can this be funny?'. To tell you the truth, you have to see it for yourself. Like TV's 'Everybody Loves Raymond', much of 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is predicated on reaction and subtlety. The quirky characters are endearing and the relationships between those characters are even juicier. for example, Margot is married to Raleigh, but is having an affair with Eli.

697792,A11GVIS6AXDEAX,B0000640VJ,James Chong,"[11, 14]","Wes Anderson's follow up to his cult classic ""Rushmore"" (a sort of 90s equivalent to ""Heathers"" in terms of its intelligent and brutally hilarious examination of young people) cements a filmmaking style that can now rightly be coined ""Andersonian."" ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" once again displays Anderson's remarkable ability to create completely self-enclosed, whimsical, fairy-tale environments and then populate them with extraordinary, but always real, characters who must overcome real human dilemmas. In this case, the central dilemma is whether or not three precocious, brilliant children (similar to J.D. Salinger's Glass family) who grew up to become troubled, lonely adults can find it within themselves to forgive their selfish, but genuinely regretful father, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) -- the rejected patriarch of the Tenenbaum family.Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson have lovingly drawn the characters of Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Richie (Luke Wilson) and have infused each of them with a poignancy that stays with you long after you leave the theater. You get a strong sense that inside each of their cold, brittle hearts is a tenderness that longs for the love and acceptance of their father, to whom they feel they were never quite good enough.In one particularly revealing scene, Royal confronts the older Margot (played beautifully by Paltrow in a role that harkens back to her small, dark, but always unforgettable early performances in films like ""Hard 8"" and ""Se7en"") on a staircase. He says to her, ""You were a genius once,"" to which she replies glumly, ""No, I wasn't."" He says, ""Well, that's what people said, anyway,"" as if he had needed confirmation from others as to the brilliance of his own children. This is a small example of the type of honesty that Anderson and Wilson bring to their treatment of each of their characters. There are simply no easy solutions to the problems that the central characters in this film deal with, and Anderson and Wilson do them (and us) the justice of allowing them to grow only as quickly as each of them are able. Even something as simple as Margot attempting, but failing, to quit smoking in the film exemplifies this treatment.Some reviewers have criticized Anderson by saying that he spent more time fabricating his unique, filmic world than in developing his characters. While it is true that ""Rushmore"" presented us with a much more fully realized character (Max Fischer), it is unfair to compare that film to ""Tenenbaums,"" since the latter is clearly meant to be an exploration of an entire family (thus the tagline, ""Family isn't a word, it's a sentence""), and ensemble pieces are rarely, if ever, as tight as singe-character pieces. No, the gift that ""Tenenbaums"" presents us with is, by the end, making us want to be a part of this grand family, as troubled and unpredictable and loopy though it may be. Not only this, but the film made me want to get on better terms with my own family, and for that, I feel like I owe a debt of thanks to Mr. Anderson and Mr. Wilson.",5,A world uniquely Andersonian,1008547200,"12 17, 2001",2001,3068,"['Wes', 'Anderson', 'follow', 'up', 'cult', 'classic', 'Rushmore', 'sort', '90s', 'equivalent', 'Heathers', 'terms', 'intelligent', 'brutally', 'hilarious', 'examination', 'young', 'people', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'can', 'now', 'rightly', 'be', 'coined', 'Andersonian', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'once', 'again', 'displays', 'Anderson', 'remarkable', 'ability', 'create', 'completely', 'self-enclosed', 'whimsical', 'fairy-tale', 'environments', 'then', 'populate', 'extraordinary', 'always', 'real', 'characters', 'who', 'must', 'overcome', 'real', 'human', 'dilemmas', 'case', 'central', 'dilemma', 'not', 'three', 'precocious', 'brilliant', 'children', 'similar', 'J.D', 'Salinger', 'Glass', 'family', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'become', 'troubled', 'lonely', 'adults', 'can', 'find', 'forgive', 'selfish', 'genuinely', 'regretful', 'father', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'rejected', 'patriarch', 'Tenenbaum', 'family.Anderson', 'co-writer', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'have', 'lovingly', 'drawn', 'characters', 'Chas', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Margot', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Richie', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'have', 'infused', 'poignancy', 'long', 'leave', 'theater', 'get', 'strong', 'sense', 'cold', 'brittle', 'hearts', 'tenderness', 'love', 'acceptance', 'father', 'whom', 'feel', 'were', 'never', 'quite', 'good', 'enough.In', 'one', 'particularly', 'revealing', 'scene', 'Royal', 'older', 'Margot', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Paltrow', 'role', 'back', 'small', 'dark', 'always', 'unforgettable', 'early', 'performances', 'films', 'Hard', '8', 'Se7en', 'staircase', 'her', 'were', 'genius', 'once', 'glumly', 'No', 'was', ""n't"", 'Well', 'what', 'people', 'said', 'anyway', 'had', 'needed', 'confirmation', 'others', 'brilliance', 'own', 'children', 'small', 'example', 'type', 'honesty', 'Anderson', 'Wilson', 'bring', 'treatment', 'characters', 'are', 'simply', 'easy', 'solutions', 'problems', 'central', 'characters', 'film', 'deal', 'Anderson', 'Wilson', 'do', 'justice', 'allowing', 'grow', 'only', 'as', 'quickly', 'are', 'able', 'Even', 'something', 'as', 'simple', 'Margot', 'attempting', 'failing', 'quit', 'smoking', 'film', 'treatment.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'criticized', 'Anderson', 'saying', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'fabricating', 'unique', 'filmic', 'world', 'developing', 'characters', 'true', 'Rushmore', 'presented', 'much', 'more', 'fully', 'realized', 'character', 'Max', 'Fischer', 'unfair', 'compare', 'film', 'Tenenbaums', 'latter', 'clearly', 'meant', 'be', 'exploration', 'entire', 'family', 'thus', 'tagline', 'Family', ""n't"", 'word', 'sentence', 'ensemble', 'pieces', 'are', 'rarely', 'ever', 'as', 'tight', 'singe-character', 'pieces', 'No', 'gift', 'Tenenbaums', 'end', 'making', 'want', 'be', 'part', 'grand', 'family', 'troubled', 'unpredictable', 'loopy', 'may', 'be', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'made', 'want', 'get', 'better', 'terms', 'own', 'family', 'feel', 'owe', 'debt', 'thanks', 'Mr.', 'Anderson', 'Mr.', 'Wilson']",The Royal Tenenbaums

The Royal Tannenbaums isn't like that, there's nothing ""Hollywood"" about it (well except for most of the actors).  The plot is loose and almost doesn't really matter, because the writing flows so well.  We never get to know any character, yet they all entertain us.And like Rushmore, the soundtrack rules the movie.  Each and every song has its purpose.  The songs drive the plot, they give the characters as much if not more emotion than their dialogues.  Its sort of like watching the Monkees on TV.  The characters talk for a minute, then next thing you know they are up to something and the music kicks right in.What Wes Anderson really has developed nicely throughout his oeuvre is his visual sense.  The Tannenbaums even tops the set design and composition of Rushmore.  The warm lighting, use of color, everything is set so perfectly.

Margo(Gwyneth Paltrow) is actually not a Tenenbaum, she's adopted and Royal never lets her forget it. She's a tad introverted and dark. Ritchie(Luke Wilson) is a world class tennis player who has fallen from grace. He's probably the most &quot;normal&quot; of the Tenenbaums but wait, oh yeah, he's in love with his sister!?! How does this all work? I'm not really sure but it does and does with flying colors. Owen Wilson plays Eli Cash, the next door neighbor who always longed to be a Tenenbaum.

697803,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,B0000640VJ,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[53, 73]","The latest film from director Wes Anderson and writer Owen Wilson, the Royal Tennenbaums tells the story of Royal Tennenbaum (Gene Hackman).  Royal and his wife Elise (Anjelica Huston) managed to sire (and adopt) a clan of three geniuses -- financial wizard Chas (Ben Stiller), former tennis star Richie (Luke Wilson), and terminally depressed and adopted daughter Margot (Gwynneth Paltrow) who is an award-winning playwright.  After being acclaimed as youthful children, the Tennenbaum geniuses are soon forgotten by the rest of the world and all three sink into self-imposed obscurities.  Margot, who is missing half the finger as the result of a macabre incident that I won't ruin by going into here, ends up married to a dull behavioral analyst (Bill Murray) while having an affair with a childhood friend, Eli (Owen Wilson) who -- desperately wanting to be a part of the acclaimed Tennenbaum geniuses -- has driven himself both to write a best-selling Western and into the depths of a dangerous drug addiction.  Chas, still recovering from the death of his wife a year earlier, has become obsessively over protective of his two children.  Meanwhile, Richie's tennis career has self-destructed, largely as a result of his obsession with his adopted sister.  And what of Royal, the man whose constant criticism drove this clan to genius and whose permanently self-centered personality helped drag it down?  Royal, having recently completed a prison term and disbarred from practicing law (for reasons that, again, I won't ruin by divulging here) hasn't seen his children for ten years.  Then, he finds out that Elise is considering the marriage proposal of her kindly accountant, Henry (Danny Glover).  Still in love with his wife (and flat broke as well), Royal returns to his family.As the above outline makes obvious, the Royal Tennenbaums is not a film that can be summed up in one sentence.  Much like Anderson and Wilson's previous Rushmore, this is a film that leaves you feeling as if you've just read an obscure but brilliant book.  (This point is made even more obvious by the use of a narrator -- Alec Baldwin giving his most likeable performance in years -- and the fact that all of the characters are published authors in some way.)  This is a film that takes the most stereotypical of ideas -- an errant father returns to heal his family -- and, in its quirky way, shakes up both its audience and its characters in unexpected, often haunting ways.  Royal never becomes a saint and, even as its quirky characters and throw-away one liners are often hilarious, this film never loses its thoughtful, melancholy feel.  The Royal Tennenbaums is a moody, introspective drama disguised as a comedy.  As such, several viewers seem to have been left scratching their heads at the film, asking the ever popular question, &quot;What was the point!?&quot; Like a great novel, the point is what the viewer chooses to take away from it. This is a film that requires you to think even after the final credit rolls and all the more power to it.Which is not to say that this film is perfect.  Its not and -- of Anderson's three films -- its probably the weakest.  Then again, considering that those other films were Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, how huge a criticism is this?  Its like complaining that Scorsese's latest isn't as good as Goodfellas or Raging Bull. Paltrow, while giving an adequate performance, is never one hundred per cent believable in her role -- she always seems like a star showing off.  Both Luke Wilson and Stiller give excellent performances (with Luke probably doing his best work to date) but its hard to accept nervy New Yorker Stiller as laid back Texan Wilson's brother.  However, the joys of the film more than make up for the film's flaws.  First amongst these joys is the performance from Gene Hackman.  Hackman finds the character's humanity without making us forget that this is not a wonderful guy.  It may be a clich&eacute; to say but in this film, Hackman proves himself to be a great actor.  Danny Glover, who at first seems to be almost an offensive stereotype, also turns in great work.  To Anderson's credit, the film gradually reveals the complexity of Glover's character until finally, its clear that Glover is actually the strongest character.  As drug-addicted Eli, Owen Wilson is a comic marvel and Seymour Cassel is hilarious as always in a nicely developed cameo role.At one point, we are told that one of Margot's autobiographical plays closed after two weeks after receiving mixed reviews.  One fears that this might also be the fate of this film.  Certainly, I know that many of the people I saw this quirky, melancholy, at times frustrating, but in the end rather moving film with were left feeling that somehow they had been cheated.  They'd come down to the theaters expecting to see either a heart warming family film or a wild comedy and instead they found themselves watching a film featuring flawed, at times rather closed-off people that didn't even have the decency to wrap everything up neatly at the end.  As the woman in front of me said, &quot;The characters were all great but that story -- well, there was no story.&quot;  No, lady, the characters were the story.  Michael Bay can't always be there to explain, step-by-excruciating-step, what everything means and how you're supposed to react.  Sometimes, a director is actually willing to ask an audience to think for itself -- thank goodness for small miracles.  Thank goodness for Wes Anderson.",4,&quot;It closed after playing two weeks to mixed reviews...&quot;,1010361600,"01 7, 2002",2002,5514,"['latest', 'film', 'director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'writer',

There are no human beings in the movie. Yes, actors occupy sets, wear costumes, say lines. Sometimes they smoke cigarettes.

Symmetrical framing, used effectively in ""Rushmore"", takes on a creepy, compulsive air: in practically every shot, these Glass wanna-bes look like objects carefully arranged on a shelf.

Like its brothers, it scales the daunting task of pairing quirkiness with sincerity.  It is a truly ensemble work; every character brings a different meaning to the whole.  Because of this, it may seem at times that Anderson has overextended himself.  However, the film never bites off more than it can chew.  Like Anderson's subtle coming-of-age &quot;Rushmore,&quot; it is a study in the process of personal revelation and redemption.  It's different from other movies with similar motives, though -- it's fun to watch.The 2-disc DVD set is nifty.  The art (which is the only reason I'd ever even think of scrapping my plain-jane &quot;Rushmore&quot; DVD for the Criterion Edition) is unbelievably sad and funny and labored, which is a good thing.  The interviews are pretty boring, and like some of the other DVD Extras, awfully self-indulgent.  But some nerd will like the Extras, and simply for the sake of thoroughness, they're a plus to the DVD and not a minus.  Pleasantly, this movie got a direct-to-Criterion release, and for good reason.  It's just a really great movie.

I wanted to see it so bad because Wes Anderson is one of my favorite directors of all time and Rushmore is my 2nd favorite film.Alot of the audience was laughing at the suttle wit and comedy the camera had.  I felt they just didn't get understand it.  I figured many of them were there just to see the cast.  That's not to say the cast is bad.  Almost every one of the actors/actresses gives an amazing performance.  I've never see Ben Stiller this serious before.  Gene Hackman deserves an oscar for this, as does Gwen Paltrow.On some parts of the film I couldn't stop lauhing.  And on some parts I was dead silent.  The film takes so many different twists turns, kinda like a rollercoaster.And to the end the review I will say this: Wes Anderson deserves an oscar.  First they pass him by for Bottle Rocket.

Period.Maybe it's me, but I always have trouble relating to 'oh so depressed' wealthy characters who do 'kooky' things (like Richie Tenenbaum's sailing around on a cruise ship, depsondent after having a breakdown at a tennis tournament... or Margot Tenenbaum's cigarette smoking that nobody knows about, not even her husband-- I don't get this at all. If my girlfriend smoked, I'd figure it out pretty quickly). I suppose it wouldn't be utterly boring if these quirks were supported by actual DEVELOPMENT OF CHARACTER!!! No one says anything towards deveolping themselves as real human beings and narrative gaps are filled in by omnicient narrator Alec Baldwin.Think about that for a minute.If I were to tell you, gentle reader, that I'm going to take you to a film where a Baldwin narrates each 'chapter' of the film for you so that you'll know why everyone is so dour, anxious and devoid of personality WOULDN'T YOU RUN SCREAMING? I would have. But, then again, I didn't know it was a Baldwin until afterwards. Knowing this has signed, sealed and delivered my total distaste for this film.Now there are other hideous cinematic crimes committed here. First and foremost is the misuse of Bill Murray. Ingeniously written and played in 'Rushmore', but here he's made a cuckold (in, and by, the film).This is also a film where, except for Hackman (and Glover/Huston during their more tender moments), no one smiles. No one shows even the slightest inclination to move one inch towards the other end of the emotional spectrum. Yeah, everyone's depressed. I get it. But even the depressed crack a smile now and again, don't they? Can't someone in this film be human? Jeez... I saw 'A Beautiful Mind' and it's protagonist has a lot to be despondent about but he delivers some COMIC RELIEF every now and then. Why not in this film which purports, in part, to be comedy? Wes, Owen... they've got some great new pharmaceuticals for whatever condition it is that your condition is in. Try popping a few of them before making your next 'dramedy', ok? OK.What else was bad? Oh, Anjelica Huston was a wasted talent here... Stiller over-acted and was too angry (but why? Oh yes. Alec told me why at the beginning of that 'chapter')... Paltrow unimpressive as usual... really hokey ending which I laughed at after the film was over (including an awkward nod to 'The Graduate' when Owen Wilson comes barelling down the street in a white convertible sports car to interrupt a Tenenbaum wedding)... some inappropriate drama which goes nowhere (Richie's attempted suicide)... and misuse of 'quirky' soundtrack featuring The Clash, Bob Dylan or Nick Drake or whoever (Anderson uses such music as a cheap device for getting out of a scene that's falling apart)What was good? Hackman. He's good in everything. Also the scene where Richie throws the tennis match. I laughed hard at that scene.Don't dismiss Wes Anderson entirely.

And gee, that's a really exciting scene, to have druggy Wilson crash his car into a house and kill a little dog. Wow, what drama. Or was that supposed to be funny? What was the purpose of that scene I wonder? Or the purpose of most scenes in this movie.The story tries to focus on the great patriarch, Gene Hackman, trying to make it up to his family. But the story really goes nowhere. There's too many silly little subplots that go nowhere, dialog that puts you to sleep, and scenes that make apparently no sense.I wish that the reviews on the rentals would accurately tell you what a film is about.

Director-coscreenwriter Wes Anderson creates a fascinating, hilarious dysfunctional clan in the Tenenbaums, especially with the three children, who are all geniuses in one way or another, but have all burned out for different reasons. The style of the movie is also initially exhilarating, too: it's presented as a kind of cinematic novel, with a prologue introducing the main characters (via narration by Alec Baldwin), eight chapters, and then an epilogue.Despite a blazing start, though, the final impression I get from THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is of a movie that strikes me as a too precious and self-indulgent for its own good. This story of how the Tenenbaum patriarch (Gene Hackman), who separated from the family when the children were young, and who reappears and helps to reenergize their lives, could have made more a genuinely touching story. Instead, the story is undermined by Wes Anderson's apparent desire to show everyone that he is such a clever guy. The obviously-composed frames, the laid-back direction of the actors---those kinds of mannerisms all add up to overwhelm the emotional substance of a story. By the end I didn't feel genuine poignancy in the final image---just the impression that, had Anderson dialed down some of the wackier elements of the plot (really, did we absolutely need Richie Tenenbaum's almost-incestuous lust for adopted sister Margo?) and made less of a show out of cuteness and wit, this might have been a much more effective movie. It's rather a shame. Wes Anderson was much more successful in his previous film RUSHMORE in balancing both his idiosyncratic style and the emotional content of its plot. I was truly touched at the end of that film in a way that I wasn't with this one.Still, I can't say that this is a terrible movie. As in RUSHMORE, Anderson's refusal to descend into insufferable bathos with plots that invite sentimental treatment is admirable. He is admittedly a fresh director, with a distinctive, offbeat style that will probably appeal to some people more than it does to others. And, among its large ensemble cast, there is one consistently great performance in this movie, Gene Hackman's portrayal of the family patriarch Royal Tenenbaum. I'll leave it to others to analyze why his performance works all the way through; for me, though, I just found him a sheer pleasure to watch. He gives such a complete performance compared to some of the one-note portrayals of the other actors that you truly miss him when he is not onscreen. His great performance is not enough, though, to save what is ultimately a disappointing movie, one that is not without its occasional charms but is overall perhaps too self-consciously clever and offbeat for its own good.",3,Potentially touching film undermined by mannered style,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,2836,"['first', 'hour', 'THE', 'ROYAL', 'TENENBAUMS', 'might', 'make', 'believe', 'may', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'terrific', 'movie', 'Director-coscreenwriter', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'fascinating', 'hilarious', 'dysfunctional', 'clan', 'Tenenbaums', 'especially', 'three', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'geniuses', 'one', 'way', 'have', 'burned', 'out', 'different', 'reasons', 'style', 'movie', 'also', 'initially', 'exhilarating', 'too', 'presented', 'kind', 'cinematic', 'novel', 'prologue', 'introducing', 'main', 'characters', 'narration', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'eight', 'chapters', 'then', 'epilogue.Despite', 'blazing', 'start', 'though', 'final', 'impression', 'get', 'THE', 'ROYAL', 'TENENBAUMS', 'movie', 'too', 'precious', 'self-indulgent', 'own', 'good', 'story', 'how', 'Tenenbaum', 'patriarch', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'who', 'separated', 'family', 'when', 'children', 'were', 'young', 'who', 'reappears', 'reenergize', 'lives', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'story', 'Instead', 'story', 'undermined', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'apparent', 'desire', 'show', 'everyone', 'such', 'clever', 'guy', 'obviously-composed', 'frames', 'laid-back', 'direction', 'actors', '-those', 'kinds', 'mannerisms', 'add', 'up', 'overwhelm', 'emotional', 'substance', 'story', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'genuine', 'poignancy', 'final', 'image', '-just', 'impression', 'had', 'Anderson', 'dialed', 'down', 'wackier', 'elements', 'plot', 'really', 'did', 'absolutely', 'need', 'Richie', 'Tenenbaum', 'almost-incestuous', 'lust', 'adopted', 'sister', 'Margo', 'made', 'less', 'show', 'cuteness', 'wit', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'movie', 'rather', 'shame', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'previous', 'film', 'RUSHMORE', 'balancing', 'idiosyncratic', 'style', 'emotional', 'content', 'plot', 'was', 'truly', 'touched', 'end', 'film', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'one.Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'terrible', 'movie', 'RUSHMORE', 'Anderson', 'refusal', 'descend', 'insufferable', 'bathos', 'plots', 'invite', 'sentimental', 'treatment', 'admirable', 'admittedly', 'fresh', 'director', 'distinctive', 'offbeat', 'style', 'will', 'probably', 'appeal', 'people', 'more', 'others', 'large', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'one', 'consistently', 'great', 'performance', 'movie', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'portrayal', 'family', 'patriarch', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'others', 'analyze', 'why', 'performance', 'way', 'just', 'found', 'sheer', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'complete', 'performance', 'compared', 'one-note', 'portrayals', 'other', 'actors', 'truly', 'miss', 'when', 'not', 'onscreen', 'great', 'performance', 'not', 'enough', 'though', 'save', 'what', 'ultimately', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'one', 'not', 'occasional', 'charms', 'overall', 'perhaps', 'too', 'self-consciously', 'clever', 'offbeat', 'own', 'good']",The Royal Tenenbaums

Gene Hackman is the divorced father, Anjelica Huston is the mother, and Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow and Luke Wilson play the grown children. All give good performances.  But the screenplay is so weirdly eccentric that I couldn't relate to it at all. It's supposed to be a comedy drama, but I neither laughed out loud nor felt any emotion during the times of pathos.  Much of the script is delivered deadpan and that's supposed to be funny.  Mostly, there's a feeling of vague discomfort throughout as the writers show off their cleverness.  The critics love it and I wouldn't be surprised if the film won some awards.  But, frankly, I can't understand how the script even got to the screen and get a budget big enough to attract big stars.

This nerdy auteur is batting a thousand on my scorecard. With BOTTLE ROCKET, RUSHMORE and now with THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, Anderson and his cohorts (especially the Wilson bros.) prove that smart movies can also be fun and incredibly entertaining. And RT is definitely all three and then some. As in RUSHMORE I am amazed at how much background he gives each character, usually with a simple montage, and even more so here as this ensemble cast is rather large. These are fully fleshed out creations who you know are living their lives in some parallel world right now. The dialogue is brilliant, the performances are top notch (although Murray's character is a bit of a throwaway), and the set/costume design create a strangely unfamiliar New York City (we know the movie takes place in the present because of the G4 Macs, etc., but it feels timeless and anachronistic). The tragi-comic situations that the characters go through rival those of characters in books by the likes of John Irving and Kurt Vonnegut. This also gives the movie (like RUSHMORE again) a more literary than cinematic feel. If this had been a book I would have loved it. As a movie it's simply marvelous.

Following the downfall of the lives of 3 childhood geniuses, Anderson and Owen Wilson's screenplay is both heartwrenching and hearwarming at the same time. Having burned out at such an early age, the Tenenbaum family tries to constantly regain their former glory, mainly unable to release the past they know they need to escape. Oddly enough, the only man able to help them accomplish this is their father, Royal, who seperated from his wife (and family in general for the most part) decades before. Having lost nearly everything to his name and needing a place to stay, Royal uses a scheme that he's on his death bed to weasel his way into his family's good graces. Anderson approaches a wide range of topics and relationships in general in a fresh light, showing a unique perspective on the human spirit, both good and bad. Tenenbaums is highlighted by a career high performance of the title character by the lovable Gene Hackman who is supported by strong performances by Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Ben Stiller as the grown up Tenenbaum clan. I should mention that if you aren't a fan of Anderson's previous ventures, Tenenbaums may not be your cup of tea (it might be anyways) as he and partner Owen Wilson have their own unique style to bring us memorable characters and places.",5,Wes Anderson strikes again!,1026259200,"07 10, 2002",2002,1389,"['Wes', 'Anderson', 'up', 'critical', 'success', 'Rushmore', 'gem', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Following', 'downfall', 'lives', '3', 'childhood', 'geniuses', 'Anderson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'screenplay', 'heartwrenching', 'hearwarming', 'same', 'time', 'Having', 'burned', 'out', 'early', 'age', 'Tenenbaum', 'family', 'tries', 'constantly', 'regain', 'former', 'glory', 'mainly', 'unable', 'release', 'past', 'know', 'need', 'escape', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'only', 'man', 'able', 'help', 'accomplish', 'father', 'Royal', 'who', 'seperated', 'wife', 'family', 'general', 'most', 'part', 'Having', 'lost', 'nearly', 'everything', 'name', 'needing', 'place', 'stay', 'Royal', 'scheme', 'death', 'bed', 'weasel', 'way', 'family', 'good', 'graces', 'Anderson', 'wide', 'range', 'topics', 'relationships', 'general', 'fresh', 'light', 'showing', 'unique', 'perspective', 'human', 'spirit', 'good', 'bad', 'Tenenbaums', 'highlighted', 'career', 'high', 'performance', 'title', 'character', 'lovable', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'who', 'supported', 'strong', 'performances', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'grown', 'up', 'Tenenbaum', 'clan', 'should', 'mention', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Anderson', 'previous', 'ventures', 'Tenenbaums', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'might', 'be', 'anyways', 'partner', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'have', 'own', 'unique', 'style', 'bring', 'memorable', 'characters', 'places']",The Royal Tenenbaums

697851,A152C8GYY25HAH,B0000640VJ,Matthew Horner,"[3, 5]","Did you ever sit stone faced while those around you were roaring with laughter? I certainly have. Aside from the fear that everyone is looking at me funny and might soon direct their laughter at me, the worst part is not knowing why they get it, and I don't. This problem has a flip side, of course. When I saw ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", I found myself among the minority that was laughing. This suggested to me that a) the rest were laughing inside, or b) many audience members were having a bad day, or c) this movie is not for everyone. Guess I'll go with ""c"".Come to think of it, director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson [yes, the movie star] always create films that are quirky and not easily accessible. Some critics think that their two previous movies, ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"" were better, but I found ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" to be their best work. All three movies have a degree of sadness lurking underneath the jokes, and this element is what some people can't relate to. Should they should be laughing when such awful things are happening to these characters? To me, the situations are humorous because I can relate to them. They are part of the human comedy and are portrayed in a whimsical, ""you must be kidding"" manner rather than in a cruel way.The poor Tenenbaum family! Its members are beyond dysfunctional. All of the siblings were child prodigies. Charles [Ben Stiller] was a Wall Street financier while still in high school. As a kid, Margot [Gwyneth Paltrow] won a $50,000 prize for a play she wrote, while Richie [Luke Wilson] was a star tennis player. Since those glory days, life's been down hill for them. All of their lives are a mess. One by one, they wind up back home with their very odd mother, Ethel [Anjelica Huston], who is less than thrilled to see them. All hell breaks loose when their deadbeat Dad, Royal [Gene Hackman], who walked out of their lives years ago, announces that he, too, wants to return to the roost. He says it because he has a terminal illness. This isn't true. He just needs a place to crash because he's broke. If his real purpose it to make amends, he can never bring himself to say so. Not that anyone in the family cares what he does. He's probably the reason they are all totally neurotic today. Forgiveness is easier thought about than done, and I doubt even a saint would find it easy to forgive a self-possessed rascal like Royal.The cast performs this outrageous tale of family values turned upside down with finesse. Hackman has a field day with Royal, one of those people who always says the wrong thing, never apologizes for it, and then leaves the listener to figure out if he meant what he said or not. Huston is perfection as Ethel, a woman who has never really listened to anybody in her whole life. Paltrow, Stiller and Wilson are colorful as the children, all of whom are of that peculiar breed that experiences great success very young, then spends the rest of life wondering where it went. The excellent supporting cast includes Owen Wilson, Danny Glover and a very funny Bill Murray.A key to enjoying a movie by Wes Anderson is knowing that it takes place in a fantasy world. If you look closely at the setting for ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", you realize that, while it may look like New York City, it isn't. The family lives on 375th Street. No such street exists. Even the house itself is somehow unreal. It's the same throughout the movie. I think this is Anderson's way of showing that it's all a joke.

I dislike movies that treat their eccentric characters too preciously.  The characters in such movies are usually eccentric for eccentricities sake -- and they usually end up being the butt of the joke (""Oh, how weird they are!  How eccentric!"").I'm happy to report that my prejudices against THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS were wrong.  In fact, it's quite a good movie.  I just finished watching it, and I'm still trying to get my head around why I liked it so much.The movie is funny.  I would classify it as a comedy.  But it's definitely a character film, too.  The reason it works so well is because the characters, despite their eccentricities, are well-drawn.But director Wes Anderson tweaks the film in such a way that makes it very interesting:  at the very beginning of the film, after an introduction that sets up the characters, Anderson shows his hand by giving screen credit to the actors (i.e. ""Angelica Houston as Etheline Tenenbaum"").  This is a litle disarming -- aren't actors supposed to ""disappear"" into the characters?  Instead, Wes Anderson trumpets their casting.Anderson also uses a book motif throughout the film.  He flashes to pages of a ""Royal Tenenbaum"" book ... chapter one, chapter four, etc.  At first, not knowing a lot about this movie, I thought it was adapted from a novel!  No, it's another interesting way that Anderson is telling the story.THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS reminded me a lot of an early John Irving book.  The characters are literary stars, playwrites, or geniuses.But the crux of the film is the Tenenbaum family.  The basic story is that Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) comes back into his family's life after an absence of many years and tries to set things straight.Wes Anderson has directed a comedy, but a very smart one.  Characters fall in holes and dogs get run over, but this movie has a heart.  I actually cried at the end when Ben Stiller's character makes his peace.  As Chas Tenenbaum, Stiller perpetually wears a red track suit (duplicated on his two children!) -- this is funny!  At a funeral, the track suit is changed ... to a black one.  Funny!  But, Chas is a well-written character too, and it is easy to understand why he acts as he does.I almost feel as if I should see THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS again.  It's got a lot of detail to it.  However, I'm satisfied after my first viewing of it.  It's a great film.

Anderson mines the same territory here that he did in &quot;Rushmore&quot;: the American Upper Middle Class...ridiculing it's apparent faults and foibles.Even though all the characters can produce a witticism about which we can wryly chuckle, the Tenenbaums are not cozy, not particularly nice nor do we much care for any of them except maybe the erstwhile &quot;villian,&quot; Royal Tenenbaum portrayed by Gene Hackman who brings a whole lotta life to the proceedings.Royal Tenenbaum, supposedly on his last legs physically and definitely penniless, after getting thrown out of his hotel of 22 years for non-payment of rent, descends upon the Tenenbaum home looking for a place to stay and maybe die. At the same time all the rest of family comes home to live for various reasons mostly having to do with one form of paranoia or another.This motley crew proceeds to grate on each other's nerves, close up emotionally and generally act in as ungracious a manner as possible.  So what else did you expect?All of this said, the film does have a certain &quot;Addams Family&quot; charm and ultimately succeeds by way of the art of accumulation: all the strangeness, all the dry wit, all the petulance, all the snotty comments and neurotic behavior beats us into submission and we leave the theater not better maybe, but somehow wiser.",4,Wit so Dry it Cracks,1010361600,"01 7, 2002",2002,1501,"['quot', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'quot', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'ode', 'dysfunctional', 'American', 'family', 'tell', 'astringently', 'dry', 'emotionally', 'cold', 'mannner', 'Anderson', 'same', 'territory', 'here', 'did', 'quot', 'Rushmore', 'quot', 'American', 'Upper', 'Middle', 'Class', 'ridiculing', 'apparent', 'faults', 'foibles.Even', 'characters', 'can', 'produce', 'witticism', 'can', 'wryly', 'chuckle', 'Tenenbaums', 'are', 'not', 'cozy', 'not', 'particularly', 'nice', 'do', 'much', 'care', 'maybe', 'erstwhile', 'quot', 'villian', 'quot', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'portrayed', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'who', 'whole', 'lotta', 'life', 'proceedings.Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'supposedly', 'last', 'legs', 'physically', 'definitely', 'penniless', 'getting', 'thrown', 'hotel', '22', 'years', 'non-payment', 'rent', 'Tenenbaum', 'home', 'looking', 'place', 'stay', 'maybe', 'die', 'same', 'time', 'rest', 'family', 'home', 'live', 'various', 'reasons', 'mostly', 'having', 'do', 'one', 'form', 'paranoia', 'another.This', 'motley', 'crew', 'proceeds', 'grate', 'other', 'nerves', 'close', 'up', 'emotionally', 'generally', 'act', 'as', 'ungracious', 'manner', 'possible', 'what', 'else', 'did', 'expect', 'said', 'film', 'have', 'certain', 'quot', 'Addams', 'Family', 'quot', 'charm', 'ultimately', 'way', 'art', 'accumulation', 'strangeness', 'dry', 'wit', 'petulance', 'snotty', 'comments', 'neurotic', 'behavior', 'beats', 'submission', 'leave', 'theater', 'not', 'better', 'maybe', 'somehow', 'wiser']",The Royal Tenenbaums
697858,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B0000640VJ,Michael Crane,"[5, 8]","This is one of those movies where you're either going to love it or hate it.  I think that most of the people who hated this film was expecting it to be a full-blown comedy.  Well...it's not.  Although, I must confess, I laughed harder and more during this film than most of the comedy blunders that have come out this year or last year.  So, if this does not sound like your type of movie, then stop reading the review and rent something like ""Shallow Hal,"" ""Dumb and Dumber,"" ""Saving Silverman,"" ""Scary Movie,"" ""Freddy Got Fingered,"" or ""Not Another Teen Movie.""  Not knocking those movies, just suggesting that those might be the type of movies your looking for.  There is nothing wrong with people not liking this film.  It is a unique one, at that.With that said, I think that ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a magnificent and brilliant picture.  A very rare breed of film, it is.  I feel it's very underrated, but then again that's because it's not a movie for everyone.  Very much like ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Vanilla Sky,"" this is a movie that will only appeal to a certain amount of people.  However, I feel that this is a great movie that plays on all of your emotions.The movie is quite simple; or at least the main storyline.  I will only give you a brief outline of it, because I do not want to give anything away.  A lot of the humor is so subtle and surprising, that if you know about it ahead of time, you will not find it as funny as you would've having not knowing what was coming.  The Tenenbaums is a family of geniuses; only problem is that they're dysfunctional as hell.  Mainly thanks to the father, Royal Tenenbaum, who has been out of the family picture for quite some time.  Over twenty years later, Royal decides it's time to be a part of the family again, being that his wife is thinking about marrying again.  So, knowing that his wife will not let him see them again unless something was seriously wrong, Royal pretends to be dying.  The results are unpredictable and outrageous.  And yet, very subtle.This film has the best cast that I have seen in a long time.  Look at it: Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny Glover, Bill Murray, and Luke and Owen Wilson.  Gene Hackman should've won something for his performance, because he steals the show.  He is so funny and sarcastic in this film.  Bill Murray is also hillarious, and dosen't get the recognition he deserves.  Owen Wilson is great as Elie Cash, who was the kid across the street who always wanted to be a Tenenbaum.  And you don't even recognize Luke Wilson until later on in the film.  But really, everyone is great.The movie is directed by Wes Anderson, who did ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore.""  Although I enjoyed those two films, I enjoyed this one much more.  It's also written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson.  Let me tell you, the screenplay in this movie is AMAZING.  Very convincing and witty.This isn't really a comedy.  It's a comedy-tragedy.  There are times where it's funny, sad, touching, dark, and sarcastic.  Again, I think that's where people got the wrong idea.  Well, at least now you know, and you can't say nobody told you so.  I just love how subtle the comedy is.  You won't find crude or toilet humor in this movie, so be warned.  Oh, and don't expect another ""Rushmore,"" please.  I cannot tell you how many reviews I read that complained that this wasn't like ""Rushmore.""  Expand your horizons, people!  You want ""Rushmore,"" this is what you do:  Watch ""Rushmore,"" and watch this when you're in the mood to see ""The Royal Tenenbuams.""What I love most is, belive it or not, this might be the first movie that I won't have to re-buy on DVD.  OH MY GOD!  That is a first.  Finally, they did it right.  They came out with a version of the movie that is ALREADY full of extras.  Cool!  Thought that was unheard of!  Wow.  Mind-blowing, man!  Well, the extras are awesome.  There's so much.  Interviews, commentary, drawings, trailers, and much MUCH more.Technical features also top-notch.  The picture is great.  Sound is great, giving you a choice between Dolby Digital and DTS.  Outstanding sound.  Brings the music to life.All in all, this movie is fantastic.  It has a great script, great cast of characters, great story, and just overall, it is a great movie.  Again, this isn't a movie for everyone.  I hope this review has helped some.

697859,A9VCD9JX1G7Y5,B0000640VJ,Michael James Allen,"[33, 39]","After viewing the film ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" I left the theater in an odd state of mind. And after digesting the film a little while, something one MUST do after watching a Wes Anderson/Owen Wilson film, I've concluded it as the best comedy of the year and one of the top five films of the year (and the same thing happend when I viewed the film ""Rushmore"" a few years earlier). Then I decided to check what other people thought of the film and came onto Amazon.com to read people's reviews. I was very distraught with what I read, not so much because people disliked the film (some people, I should not lump ALL people in this category; there are SOME innovative filmgoers amongst you all) but because of why they didn't. People complained that there were no laughs to be had. Granted, there are not belly laughs and guffaws to be had at ""Tenenbaums,"" but this should be expected considering how ""Rushmore"" was set up and executed. Wes Anderson and his writing partner do not go for the cheap laughs and the slapstick sight gags that make so many current movies the cheap, raunch fare that they are. Being a writer myself I've come to realize that there is much more to comedy than making a person jiggle with laughter. In fact, no where in the definition of the term ""comedy"" is the word ""laugh"" used. Comedy deals with a general feeling it bestows upon an audience member. One of humor and affection (be it dark or otherwise).Anyway, to get back to the point, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is solely structured on giving off a feeling of comedy while also playing for more psychological and emotional connections with it's audience. I will openly admit I laughed outloud less than ten times throughout the film (although when I did laugh, it was very well deserved). I did, however, have a smile on my face throughout the ENTIRE thing. And that's what comedy, at least one designed like this one, is meant to do. I commend Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson for making such a remarkably structured film and reccommend it to anyone who has the desire to see the ""Thinking Man's Comedy.""",5,"In Defense of ""Tenenbaum"" - Comedy doesn't always = laughs",1012521600,"02 1, 2002",2002,2076,"['viewing', 'film', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'left', 'theater', 'odd', 'state', 'mind', 'digesting', 'film', 'little', 'while', 'something', 'one', 'MUST', 'do', 'watching', 'Wes', 'Anderson/Owen', 'Wilson', 'film', ""'ve"", 'concluded', 'best', 'comedy', 'year', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'films', 'year', 'same', 'thing', 'happend', 'when', 'viewed', 'film', 'Rushmore', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'Then', 'decided', 'check', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'thought', 'film', 'came', 'Amazon.com', 'read', 'people', 'reviews', 'was', 'very', 'distraught', 'what', 'read', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'people', 'disliked', 'film', 'people', 'should', 'not', 'lump', 'ALL', 'people', 'category', 'are', 'SOME', 'innovative', 'filmgoers', 'amongst', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'People', 'complained', 'were', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'Granted', 'are', 'not', 'belly', 'guffaws', 'be', 'had', 'Tenenbaums', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'considering', 'how', 'Rushmore', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'executed', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'writing', 'partner', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'slapstick', 'sight', 'gags', 'make', 'so', 'many', 'current', 'movies', 'cheap', 'raunch', 'fare', 'are', 'Being', 'writer', ""'ve"", 'come', 'realize', 'much', 'more', 'comedy', 'making', 'person', 'jiggle', 'laughter', 'fact', 'where', 'definition', 'term', 'comedy', 'word', 'laugh', 'used', 'Comedy', 'deals', 'general', 'feeling', 'audience', 'member', 'One', 'humor', 'affection', 'be', 'dark', 'otherwise', '.Anyway', 'get', 'back', 'point', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'solely', 'structured', 'giving', 'off', 'feeling', 'comedy', 'also', 'playing', 'more', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'connections', 'audience', 'will', 'openly', 'admit', 'laughed', 'outloud', 'less', 'ten', 'times', 'film', 'when', 'did', 'laugh', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'deserved', 'did', 'however', 'have', 'smile', 'face', 'ENTIRE', 'thing', 'what', 'comedy', 'least', 'one', 'designed', 'one', 'meant', 'do', 'commend', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'making', 'such', 'remarkably', 'structured', 'film', 'reccommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'desire', 'see', 'Thinking', 'Man', 'Comedy']",The Royal Tenenbaums

Well, actually it could be from anywhere in the galaxy as you may not come across a more strange slew of characters in one place anywhere on God's green earth. For openers, Gene Hackman plays a hysterical deadbeat dad who had been alienated by the rest of his bizarre family for ignorance to them and vulgarity to others which can include even us the audience. Yet at the same time the viewer will be sympathetic to him and his mischievous routine and rebellious nature given his sly warmheartedness and charm. The trio of the children's life stories (wild and wholly tales portrayed in retrospect and real-time by Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow & Luke Wilson) surround this rude and complex father shortcomings in spectacular fashion while combative yet dignified mom played by Angelica Houston is a steady presence amongst the chaos. Owen Wilson and Bill Murray round out the supporting cast for this fun-filled comedy.

697862,A1VLHZ9KXRGVE0,B0000640VJ,Mike,"[2, 2]","The Royal Tenenbaums is the kind of film that you will be talking about long after you've seen it, and trying your hardest to convince literally everyone you know to see it as well.The plot revolves around Royal Tenenbaum, played by Gene Hackman, who split up with his wife, Etheline, while their three genius children were still in their youth. Growing up each with their own special skills, they hit their peak too early on in life, and the family drifted apart. Now, quite some years later, they reunite, and all come together in a humorous, yet somewhat saddening way. Ben Stiller plays the role of Chas Tenenbaum, a genius accountant, who started buying property at the tender age of ten. Chas's two children are well-loved by their father, yet Chas himself is all-together overprotective of them. The lovely Gwyneth Paltrow gives a dazzling performance as Margot Tenenbaum, a prodigy of a playwright, who as a child, was awarded a $50,000.00 grant for one of her plays. She is now married to the fabulous Bill Murray's character, Raleigh St. Claire, who loves his wife, but has doubts as to whether or not she loves him back. Luke Wilson is absolutely stunning as Richie Tenenbaum, a tennis pro, who is only trying to keep the peace within the Tenenbaum family. Eli Cash is played by co-writer of the film, Owen Wilson, and delivers an on-screen performance that rivals his fantastic work in the wonderful Bottle Rocket. Eli is a childhood friend of the Tenenbaums, and currently a writer of incredibly cheesy western novels. He has always wanted to be a Tenenbaum, and his adult life harbors a rather dark secret. Etheline is now set to marry Mr. Sherman, played by Danny Glover, and Royal himself claims to be dying of stomach cancer, therefore bringing the entire Tenenbaum family together once again.The Royal Tenenbaums is one of those rare films which you don't quite want to turn off, even well after the credits are rolling. The sheer pureness of the script, the cast, and the director all come together in something that is genuinely satisfying. Never since Bottle Rocket or Rushmore have I been so spellbound with a movie in my whole life. Altogether, a great film rich in heart and emotional spirit, and delivers laughs that are subtle and genuine. The Criterion Collection Two-Disc DVD loads up on well-deserved special features that include full commentary, interviews, and the great quality picture and sound that DVD owners have come to expect. Altogether, a terrific movie, and yet, an even better DVD.",5,"A Great Film, and an Even Better DVD!",1026432000,"07 12, 2002",2002,2524,"['Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'kind', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'talking', 'long', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trying', 'hardest', 'convince', 'literally', 'everyone', 'know', 'see', 'well.The', 'plot', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'played', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'who', 'split', 'up', 'wife', 'Etheline', 'three', 'genius', 'children', 'were', 'still', 'youth', 'Growing', 'up', 'own', 'special', 'skills', 'hit', 'peak', 'too', 'early', 'life', 'family', 'drifted', 'apart', 'Now', 'quite', 'years', 'later', 'reunite', 'come', 'together', 'humorous', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'saddening', 'way', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'role', 'Chas', 'Tenenbaum', 'genius', 'accountant', 'who', 'started', 'buying', 'property', 'tender', 'age', 'ten', 'Chas', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'well-loved', 'father', 'yet', 'Chas', 'all-together', 'overprotective', 'lovely', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'dazzling', 'performance', 'Margot', 'Tenenbaum', 'prodigy', 'playwright', 'who', 'child', 'was', 'awarded', '50,000.00', 'grant', 'one', 'plays', 'now', 'married', 'fabulous', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'Raleigh', 'St.', 'Claire', 'who', 'wife', 'doubts', 'not', 'back', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Richie', 'Tenenbaum', 'tennis', 'pro', 'who', 'only', 'trying', 'keep', 'peace', 'Tenenbaum', 'family', 'Eli', 'Cash', 'played', 'co-writer', 'film', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'delivers', 'on-screen', 'performance', 'fantastic', 'work', 'wonderful', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'Eli', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Tenenbaums', 'currently', 'writer', 'incredibly', 'cheesy', 'western', 'novels', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'Tenenbaum', 'adult', 'life', 'rather', 'dark', 'secret', 'Etheline', 'now', 'set', 'marry', 'Mr.', 'Sherman', 'played', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Royal', 'be', 'dying', 'stomach', 'cancer', 'therefore', 'bringing', 'entire', 'Tenenbaum', 'family', 'together', 'once', 'again.The', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'want', 'turn', 'off', 'even', 'well', 'credits', 'are', 'rolling', 'sheer', 'pureness', 'script', 'cast', 'director', 'come', 'together', 'something', 'genuinely', 'satisfying', 'Never', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'Rushmore', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'spellbound', 'movie', 'whole', 'life', 'Altogether', 'great', 'film', 'rich', 'heart', 'emotional', 'spirit', 'delivers', 'laughs', 'are', 'subtle', 'genuine', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Two-Disc', 'DVD', 'up', 'well-deserved', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'full', 'commentary', 'interviews', 'great', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'DVD', 'owners', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'Altogether', 'terrific', 'movie', 'yet', 'even', 'better', 'DVD']",The Royal Tenenbaums
697863,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B0000640VJ,Mike Stone,"[10, 15]","The following review will only discuss the features on ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" Special Edition DVD put out by Criterion.------------After the stunning success of the Criterion DVD for ""Rushmore"", Wes Anderson has gone back to that same company to produce a special edition of ""The Royal Tenenbaums"".  It does not disappoint.Disc one contains a stunning widescreen transfer of the movie, and a commentary track.  Wes does the honours alone this time, and his track is loaded with juicy tidbits.  He's got this fragile little voice, barely above a whisper, but he speaks with such authority about the kind of film he was trying to make.  Everything seems to be under his control, from the set designs (about which he can't help go on and on, to the point where he remarks that his comments are probably getting quite tedious; uh, they aren't), to the music, to the camera shots, to the colour, etc., etc., etc.  But on the other hand, there are several moments where he just can't explain why a line of dialogue or a visual is included, but he knew intuitively that it would work.  Invariably, it does.  The ""Coltrane"" comment is a great example of this, as is the colour of Chas' workout suit (one of the best anecdotes has Wes admitting that the reason he gave Ben Stiller for the colour of the suits was made up on the spot, having never come up with a real reason of his own; he just knew that that was what he wanted).  He's also quite unapologetic about stealing moments from movies that influenced him.  References to Cocteau, Bunuel, and Truffaut abound; he points out that the opening is lifted directly from Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons""; and he provides the much sought after reference explaining the mysterious line Luke Wilson speaks into the mirror.  Wes is a director who wears his influences proudly on his sleeve, but is still able to mix them up in a way that seems fresh and original.On Disc two we get a whole load of supplementals.  ""With the Filmmaker"" is a 25-minute documentary, I believe for the Independent Film Channel, that follows Wes around during preproduction of the movie.  It's great to see his inventiveness and his attention to detail shown full-force.  Wes, as a screen persona, reminds me a lot of R. Crumb, if Crumb were 20 years younger, had less of a drawl, and a more stable family.  Wes comes across as an unabashed geek in this feature, but a geek who knows what he wants to do with the power he's been given.  It's a real treat.""The Peter Bradley Show"" is a bizarre mock talk show segment, hosted by an actor (whose name is mentionned at some point, but escapes me now) as Bradley, a Charlie Rose-esque interviewer.  He's a befuddled and confused man, who appears to believe that the men he's interviewing are real actors, when in fact they are merely Anderson's non-actor friends, each of whom have bit parts in his movies.  Most interesting revelations: the film's namesake, Brian Tenenbaum, works selling steel over the phone, and Sanjay Mathew's (a childhood friend of Wes' who plays Richie Tenenbaum's tennis opponent) favourite drug to prescribe to his psychiatric patients is Remeron.  I can't figure out where this segment came from, but I'm pretty sure it's not meant to be taken seriously.  Or is it?  Must be seen to be believed.The disc features a number of graphical sections, owing their inclusion to Wes' passion for background ephemera.  You get: a slide show of photos taken from the set; the covers of all the fake books that appeared in the movie; all of Richie Tenenbaum's portraits of his sister (complete with a bibliography of the plays she is shown reading in those pictures: Ionesco, Brecht, Beckett, etc.); details of Richie's wall murals; details of the paintings of Miguel Calderon that inspired Eli Cash's madness, etc.  All included in toto for your perusal.  For those of you (us) who love to get lost in the backgrounds of Wes' films, here's another opportunity to indulge your passions.Also included are some quick, candid moments from the set (including Angelica Huston's hair catching fire, and Kumar Palana's plate spinning act).In a movie so full of on-disc extras and goodies, I'm shocked to report that the set's greatest treasures can be found in its liner notes.  Two separate foldouts come in the case.  The first is an epic collection of Eric Chas Anderson's (Wes' brother) drawings, detailing the floor plans and interior designs of the Tenenbaum's home.  Eric's drawing style is delightfully juvenile, innocent and colourful and vivacious.  It's good to know that Wes isn't the only one in the Anderson clan obsessed by detail.  Mies van der Rohe would be most proud.  The second foldout has a wonderful, lengthy essay on Anderson's oeuvre by Kent Jones.  Jones, a contributing editor of 'Film Comment' and a contributor to 'Cahiers du Cinema' and 'The Village Voice', dissects ""Bottle Rocket"", ""Rushmore"", and ""Tenenbaums"" with the skill of a surgeon and the unabashed passion of Casanova.I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" when it played in theatres, and am looking forward to years of enjoyment, repeatedly playing this wonderful

This oddball dramedy is one of the most original movies in years.  It is the story of the ultimate dysfunctional family, the Tenenbaums.  Despite their uncaring and self-involved patriarch, Royal Tenenbaum, the three children all attained fame as child prodigies.  Not surprisingly, as they've grown up they've remained trapped in the emotional wasteland of their childhood.  Royal's return to the family circle forces each to confront their childhood resentments and to re-evaluate their family relationships.  It would be an injustice to classify this movie strictly as a comedy.  The movie is far too emotionally honest not to be considered a drama.  Despite the outlandishness of the characters, they are very human and surprisingly sympathetic.  The comedy is multi-layered, from the broad visuals to the subtle dialogue, and always delightful.  The all-star cast is consistently superb, so much so that it's impossible to pick any particular standouts.

The Royal Tenenbaums centers around Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) and his estranged, dysfunctional family including his ex-wife Etheline (Anjelica Houston) and his three former child genius children (Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, and Luke Wilson).  All of whom are brought back together after years of seperation when word of Royal's terminally ill status is revealed, and this is where The Royal Tenenbaums truly shines.  Anderson co-wrote with co-star Owen Wilson (as a drug addicted literary celebrity) and brings the rich, emotionally comedic story to life.  Hackman absolutely shines in his role, and the rest of the cast is great as well, although there are a certain number of parts that just seem a bit unbelieveable and sometimes the story can get a bit uneven, but the unique comedy (much like Anderson's Rushmore) make The Royal Tenenbaums a winner.  Danny Glover co-stars as Etheline's soon to be new husband which Royal must contend with, and Bill Murray also stars as Paltrow's psychiatrist husband and Alec Baldwin provides the film's narration.

And it's an interesting, engaging film. It's nicely edited and put together, the format works well, and dividing the film into narrative chapters gives it a sense of rhythm and direction.Which isn't to say it actually has one. I came out of the film scratching my head a bit, wondering if I'd missed something. But when I thought about it, I couldn't figure out what there was to miss.The Royal Tenenbaums ambles along for a couple of hours without ever cohering, or even trying to: the characters are wildy exaggerated in random directions for no apparent reason other than the sight gag - which invariably isn't funny (a bright red 1970s red tracksuit? Har Har. 1970s Bjorn Borg getup? Har Har). Their adventures are similarly overblown. Now, this sort of approach works in two circumstances: genuine slapstick (e.g. Abbott & Costello), and dark irony (e.g. the Coen Brothers).Royal Tenenbaums sure isn't slapstick - other than for the occasional moment which produced a genuine cackle (for example, a marital celebrant being shoved down a flight of stairs) - and though it it holds itself out as a black comedy, it just isn't. While it has a few unsettling images, it can't be: It doesn't make a point, it doesn't have anything to say, and it ends on a horribly saccharine note which would undermine any irony in the film anyway.

Plainly stated, you either love his work, or hate it. It is also known that Mr. Anderson's view of comedy is VERY dry...almost sarcastic and very realistic. (I mean, lets face it, there aren't that many Will Ferrels in everyday life) AND his use of this ""stellar cast"" in the film is almost a satire. He has the chance to use each talented member of the cast to the fullest, but chooses not to...almost to see how ""realistic"" each person can be...and how convincing each is to there own characters role...So, all of the above in consideration...(and strictly in my opinion) I believe this is one of the single most entertaining films I have ever seen. Further more...I will even go as far as to say it is one of the BEST American films ever created. If people don't watch this movie for any other reason, it should be watched for Luke Wilson's performance. The ""bathroom scene"" is one of my favorite scenes in cinema, and possibly Luke at his finest.The Wilson Brothers really had me since Bottle Rocket, but Luke stole the show in this...Great movie with a lot to it, and a great plot that plays out in almost a fairytale way.

697884,A3U4VUSBJMR5KP,B0000640VJ,Patrick A. Hayden,"[7, 11]","""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is the third collaboration between director Wes Anderson and writer/actor Owen Wilson.  While it is not as perfect as their previous film, ""Rushmore"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums is still an instant classic, with an outstanding cast at the top of their game, beautiful Cinematography & Art Direction, yet another great soundtrack, and a beautiful story about love, family and redemption.The story of the film is thus: Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), patriarch of a family of gifted children, has been estranged from them for close to 20 years.  He has been seperated, but not divorced, from his wife for that same period of time.  All in all, it appears he could really care less about them, until he discovers that his wife, Etheline (Anjelica Huston), has been proposed to by her accountant, Henry Sherman (Danny Glover, in a great understated performance, probably his best since ""The Color Purple).  This stirs something in Royal, so he cooks up a scheme to get back into her and the children's lives.  He pretends he is dying.  Don't worry, it's not a spoiler, and is clear from the very beginning.Meanwhile, the children have all grown up twisted, in their own way.  Ritchie (Luke Wilson), the oldest and Royal's favorite, was a Tennis phenom who melted down during a match and has been traveling the world on a steamer ever since, and is still clad in his tennis gear, posing for pictures as ""the 'Baumer"".  He is in love with his sister, Margot (Gweneth Paltrow), who is adopted and a perpetually depressed playwrite, who is married to Raleigh St. Claire (Bill Murray, giving yet another understated yet hilarious pefromance), a nuerologist and lecturer.  She is cheating on him with Eli Cash (Owen Wilson), Ritchie's best friend and drug-addicted English Lit professor who just gained noteriety for his book ""Old Custer"".  Finally, there is Chaz (Ben Stiller), who was always a financial wiz, and who is obssessed with the safety of his sons after his wife dies in a plane crash.  Once he moves back into their home, ther rest of the kids come back, and then Royal re-enters their lives and the movie takes off.The film is a comedy, yes, but it is bittersweet and sad at the same time.  Each of the children is severely disfunctional, primarily because of Royal.  he characters are extreme, yes, but in a way I think the film was meant to be a portrait of any family where things get rocky, where favortisim is showed to one child over the others, where love is not in the equation.  Eventually, the film is about redemption, and not just Royal's but some other characters as well.  The story itself is beautiful and absurd enough to know that it came from the slightly skewed perspectives of Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson.Gene Hackman would have dominated this movie had he been the only name actor cast.  I'm not saying other, lesser known actors woouldn't have been just as good.  I'm just saying that everyone else is so perfectly cast, it becomes almost forgiveable that Hackman was not nominated for an Oscar for this role.  Almost.  It's still a crime.  Royal is corrupt but likable, tactless but sweet in his own way.  Hackman takes the role and makes it his own.  Other cast standouts are Danny Glover, showing a gift for the sly comedy Anderson and Wilson are known for, Luke Wilson in his performance of Ritchie shows a range he has not been able to stretch in his Hollywood roles, and while Gweneth Paltrow and Ben Stiller also give excellent performances, special notice must be given to Kumar Pallana as Pagoda, Royal's valet, an Indian actor used in ever Anderson film, starting with ""Bottle Rocket"".  Here he is given a major role, and every one of his lines is a solid laugh.  He really shines here, and although I'm sure you won't see him until the next Anderson film, he's worth seeing here.The score by Mark Mothersbaugh is twinkly and beautiful, as were his scores for ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"".  Mothersbaugh used to be in DEVO, and you get the impression that he and Anderson understand each other on a wierd level.  The art direction is terrific.  The Tenenbaum house looks like something out of a dream, as does the New York City Anderson shows us in the film, a gentler side to the city that is rarely seen.  The film looks terrific.The folk at Criterion have done a great job on the Special Edition.  There are a couple of deleted scenes, an outtake or two, interviews with all the cast members that focus on their approach to the characters, two video features, one a serious look at Wes Anderson as a filmmaker, one a hilarious takeoff on Charlie Rose type shows.  There is also a large gallery of the art produced for the film.  It is simple and elegant, and captures the innocence of youth tha Anderson goes for in his early scenes in the movie.  There is also a little audio on the two bizzare paintings at Eli Cash's house that must be heard to be believed.""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a fine film by a director who is still underappreciated by Hollywood as a whole, a director who seems to be an actor's director.  He's shown that he can get great performances out of anybody.

Nothing gets developed, nothing really matters and when one character decides to slit their wrists all you feel is as my wife put it, ""One less boring character to follow.""It's amazing what you can do if you take an all star cast and shoehorn them into a film that isn't really as good as they are.  Certainly Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston are pretty good and do well with their material but the rest of the first rate cast just seem to drift unable to make lemonade out of the lemon they are given.Ironically this might have worked as a sitcom or mini series.

The emotional pack is just slightly missing the fuse at times but other than that, think of this movie as the story of dysfunctional family through the eyes of a director that likes silly people. Yes, it's a quirky looking world the Tenenbaums inhabit and dress for, so if you don't tolerate a director who revels in some visual horseplay here and there, don't watch it! I love it personally, Anderson can play up a satirical look at people while making it all his own vision.As for the plot, Royal is the patriarch of the family who was exiled long ago for his constant affairs. Gene Hackman plays him as still the same jovial, wild-hearted swindler who realizes when his wife is going to get remarried that he's angry about it. He tries to recapture her interest and tries to make amends with all his children while he's at it. So the movie is essentially a swim through a family's closet of skeletons, arrested angers and hurts, yet the redeeming part is Royal is at least working to try and get everyone a family again, despite his still shallow morals. If there's anything that's a let down about this hilarious trip through the ghosts of a family's past... it's that Bill Murray got a bit part and has no good lines, and other than that there's a love interest subplot that was sort of bittersweet.",5,The inevitability of family dysfuction... and a comedy,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,1379,"['not', 'favorite', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'film', 'second', 'favorite', 'emotional', 'pack', 'just', 'slightly', 'missing', 'fuse', 'times', 'other', 'think', 'movie', 'story', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'eyes', 'director', 'silly', 'people', 'Yes', 'quirky', 'looking', 'world', 'Tenenbaums', 'inhabit', 'dress', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'tolerate', 'director', 'who', 'visual', 'horseplay', 'here', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'love', 'personally', 'Anderson', 'can', 'play', 'up', 'satirical', 'look', 'people', 'making', 'own', 'vision.As', 'plot', 'Royal', 'patriarch', 'family', 'who', 'was', 'exiled', 'long', 'ago', 'constant', 'affairs', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'still', 'same', 'jovial', 'wild-hearted', 'swindler', 'who', 'when', 'wife', 'going', 'get', 'remarried', 'angry', 'recapture', 'interest', 'tries', 'make', 'amends', 'children', 'movie', 'essentially', 'swim', 'family', 'closet', 'skeletons', 'arrested', 'angers', 'hurts', 'yet', 'redeeming', 'part', 'Royal', 'least', 'working', 'try', 'get', 'everyone', 'family', 'again', 'still', 'shallow', 'morals', 'anything', 'let', 'down', 'hilarious', 'trip', 'ghosts', 'family', 'past', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'got', 'bit', 'part', 'good', 'lines', 'other', 'love', 'interest', 'subplot', 'was', 'sort', 'bittersweet']",The Royal Tenenbaums

I can't berate those reviewers who panned the film, the film just didn't work for them as it did for me. I gave it five stars. I did not care for Bottle Rocket or Rushmore from the same director but The Royal Tenenbaums is terrific.The cast is first rate of course, most of the negative reviews commented on the plot and did not pan the cast. The plot? Its about a father (Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum) alienated from his dysfunctional family. Broke and thrown out of the hotel he has lived in for many years, he manipulates his way back into the household only to discover he really does care about these people. The family has problems because he wasn't around and he tries to make things right. That's it. There is a lot going on but that is essentially the story.The circumstances and the dialog rings true.

I remember slumping in my seat after 45 minutes realizing this dreck was as good as it was going to get.  I bought into the hype by film critics who should know better.This black comedy about a dysfunctional family misses in every way.  Sure the casting is offbeat, but so what if Ben Stiller wears a 70's track suit, or Gwnyeth Paltrow smokes cigarettes on the sly and looks unattractive, is that it?  Where does that go?  I cared nothing for any of the characters, the Luke Wilson character was just morbid.  Ha ha he's a fallen tennis pro, ha ha, Owen Wilson crashes his car, what was the point of it all?  Gene Hackman tries his best, but despite his good reviews, he is wasted here.  I saw nothing original here, nothing that inspired me, it's a sad commentary on today's movie that people who should know better love just anything that seems offbeat.

697898,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0000640VJ,RMurray847,"[1, 2]","I readily admit this movie is not for everyone.  It does have a pretty skewed sense of humor, and is light on physical comedy and heavy on irony, verbal humor and hysterical costumes.It's the story of the Tenenbaum family, headed by Royal (Gene Hackman) and his wife (Angelica Huston). In a VERY funny opening sequence, we are told the story of the early days of their children, the brilliant inventor/businessman (grows up to be Ben Stiller), the award-winning playwright (become Gwyneth Paltrow) and the tennis prodigy (grows into Luke Wilson).  These kids are supremely [messed] up, and it only gets worse when their parents split and Hackman moves out.Many years later, Hackman finds himself down and out, and so he tells everyone that he is dieing, and naturally he is taken in (although reluctantly).  He begins to realize that he would like to ""make things right"" with his family, despite their HUGE reluctance.  But change does come, and it's sweet to see.And this is all VERY funny.  Everyone gives fantastically funny performances, including Owen Wilson (who co-wrote) as a drugged-out family friend, Danny Glover as Angelica's current beau and Bill Murray as Gwyneth's husband.  Everyone is terrific.  The characters are all outrageous, but the performers make them touching and believable.And Hackman was ABSOLUTELY ROBBED by not getting an Oscar nomination.  His development from beginning to end is so subtle.  We go from hate to respect over the course of the movie, and it never feels forced. The movie, for me, was full of huge laughs, but also several very touching moments, particularly with Ben Stiller, of all people.If you enjoyed the comedies of the Coen brothers (RAISING ARIZONA, for example) you will probably like this.  If you enjoyed RUSHMORE or ELECTION, you will certainly like it.

697900,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000640VJ,Robert Moore,"[43, 51]","I loved this film, but I can completely understand many, many people not enjoying it.  In fact, I was one of the few people, it seems, who disliked Anderson's second film, RUSHMORE (though I loved BOTTLE ROCKET, Wes Anderson's first film).  The reason that so many will either love or hate this film is Anderson continually skirts the edges of cinematic convention.  There is a great deal of subtlety in his work, and one will either enjoy that and analyze it, or find that it leaves them bored and disinterested.Anderson wrote this screenplay with he usual screenwriting partner, Owen Wilson (who played Eli, the Tennenbaums across-the-street neighbor).  The screenplay is filled with many wonderful and marvelous moments, and while one might complain that the whole is less than the summation of the parts, the parts are nonetheless very exquisite.  The film is stuffed with marvelous moments that are almost throwaways, like a scene in which Chas (Ben Stiller) and his father Royal (Gene Hackman) escape to a closet to argue.  The closet is filled with every board game one can possibly imagine, which provides a startling contrast by implying that there was a time when the family perhaps sat around together playing these precise games.  Or when one of the characters attempts suicide and then leaves the hospital, a haunting, gorgeous song by Nick Drake, &quot;Fly&quot; is played.  The song is a marvelous paean to second chances, and many of the lyrics seem to refer to specific moments in the film.  But what is more poignant is the fact that Drake is one of rock's most celebrated suicides, albeit primarily to his cult following.  Another detail is the fact that every cab that is seen in the entire film are &quot;Gypsy Cabs&quot; and are the most dilapidated, battered cabs one can imagine.The soundtrack is exquisite, and one that even those not enjoying the movie would be tempted to buy.  The selections are marvelous, whether it is Ravel's String Quartet, or the Ramones, or the Clash, or Lou Reed, or the Stones.  One word of complaint, however.  As a Stones fan and as one who owned vinyl versions of most of their albums, and the two Stones songs that Luke Wilson and Gwenyth Paltrow listen to in his tent are not the songs that are on the actual vinyl album.  &quot;Ruby Tuesday,&quot; for instance, is not the second cut but the third, and the song that appears first is actually a couple of cuts after &quot;Ruby Tuesday.&quot;The cast is absolutely first rate, though many of the actors are playing roles that are somewhat at odds with what we normally expect of them.  This is especially true of the three Tennenbaum children.So, while I expect that many people seeing this will dislike it, many others will enjoy it thoroughly.

697901,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B0000640VJ,Robert Morris,"[1, 3]","I include this film among those which do not easily fit into a category other than ""comedy."" For example, Beat the Devil (1953), A Thousand Clowns (1965), A Fish Called Wanda (1988), Cold Comfort Farm (1995), Waking Ned Devine (1998), and Gosford Park (2002). Oh sure, each has a plot of sorts but not much really happens. Several memorable characters. Highly literate dialogue. In some instances, brilliant exterior cinematography. However, in my opinion, the appeal of such films is largely explained in terms of the bizarre relationships they portray between and among characters, most of whom are oddballs. That is certainly true of the members of the Tanenbaum family, with the possible exception of Etheline (Anjelica Huston). Royal Tanenbaum (Gene Hackman) is the family's, indeed the film's gravitational center.For reasons best revealed in the film, Royal has been alienated from his wife, two sons, and daughter for many years. A convicted felon and disbarred attorney, Royal seeks a reunion with his family for economic as well as emotional reasons. Working brilliantly with a screenplay co-authored by director Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson (who also plays a Tanenbaum wannabe, Eli Cash), Hackman displays a full range of comic gifts previously evident in other films, notably Young Frankenstein (1974), Get Shorty (1995) and The Birdcage (1996). I hasten to add that Hackman's immense talent also allows him to invest the character of Royal Tanenbaum with dimensions and nuances of decency which (for me) offset his reckless and sometimes contemptible behavior. Royal has moments of poignancy which are almost palpable.  Perhaps these brief remarks help to suggest why I find this film so difficult to categorize. The direction is crisp and the acting consistently first-rate. The screenplay combines zany humor with human deficiencies which are at times endearing. When Royal Tanenbaum selected an epitaph for himself, he also inadvertently provided an appropriate affirmation of this film's essential spirit.The two-disc DVD version includes several special features which include a commentary by Anderson, ""With the Filmmaker: Portraits by Albert Maysles, featuring Wes Anderson""; exclusive video interviews and behind-the-scenes footage of Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and Danny Glover; and ""The Peter Bradley Show,"" featuring interviews with additional cast members.",5,Regal Dysfunction,1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,2454,"['include', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'easily', 'fit', 'category', 'other', 'comedy', 'example', 'Beat', 'Devil', '1953', 'Thousand', 'Clowns', '1965', 'Fish', 'Called', 'Wanda', '1988', 'Cold', 'Comfort', 'Farm', '1995', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Devine', '1998', 'Gosford', 'Park', '2002', 'Oh', 'sure', 'plot', 'sorts', 'not', 'much', 'really', 'Several', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Highly', 'literate', 'dialogue', 'instances', 'brilliant', 'exterior', 'cinematography', 'However', 'opinion', 'appeal', 'such', 'films', 'largely', 'explained', 'terms', 'bizarre', 'relationships', 'portray', 'characters', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'oddballs', 'certainly', 'true', 'members', 'Tanenbaum', 'family', 'possible', 'exception', 'Etheline', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Royal', 'Tanenbaum', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'family', 'indeed', 'film', 'gravitational', 'center.For', 'reasons', 'best', 'revealed', 'film', 'Royal', 'been', 'alienated', 'wife', 'two', 'sons', 'daughter', 'many', 'years', 'convicted', 'felon', 'disbarred', 'attorney', 'Royal', 'reunion', 'family', 'economic', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'reasons', 'Working', 'brilliantly', 'screenplay', 'co-authored', 'director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'who', 'also', 'Tanenbaum', 'wannabe', 'Eli', 'Cash', 'Hackman', 'full', 'range', 'comic', 'gifts', 'previously', 'evident', 'other', 'films', 'notably', 'Young', 'Frankenstein', '1974', 'Get', 'Shorty', '1995', 'Birdcage', '1996', 'hasten', 'add', 'Hackman', 'immense', 'talent', 'also', 'invest', 'character', 'Royal', 'Tanenbaum', 'dimensions', 'nuances', 'decency', 'offset', 'reckless', 'sometimes', 'contemptible', 'behavior', 'Royal', 'moments', 'poignancy', 'are', 'almost', 'palpable', 'Perhaps', 'brief', 'remarks', 'help', 'suggest', 'why', 'find', 'film', 'so', 'difficult', 'categorize', 'direction', 'crisp', 'acting', 'consistently', 'first-rate', 'screenplay', 'zany', 'humor', 'human', 'deficiencies', 'are', 'times', 'endearing', 'When', 'Royal', 'Tanenbaum', 'selected', 'epitaph', 'also', 'inadvertently', 'provided', 'appropriate', 'affirmation', 'film', 'essential', 'spirit.The', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'version', 'several', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'commentary', 'Anderson', 'Filmmaker', 'Portraits', 'Albert', 'Maysles', 'featuring', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'exclusive', 'video', 'interviews', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Peter', 'Bradley', 'Show', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'additional', 'cast', 'members']",The Royal Tenenbaums

Great quality and looks great on most screens.  Once again, these things are aimed at those lucky few with widescreen monitors.  Expect awesome playback.Audio:  Comes with Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 audio.  Talk about sweet sounding.  Whether you're playing this on a laptop or in your banging home theater, the clear center speaking audio, the right left music, and nice surround sound use makes the audio track shine.  Very clear with no odd ambient noises, clicking, or strange hissing.  And since this movie is heavily driven by music (check out the CD for this one) it's nice to know that rich sound comes through loud and clear.Disc one Commentary:  The commentary by Wes Anderson is a great thing to see.  It's got great insight, some humor, wonderful detail, and really ties together points that seem to make sense but might need a little clarification or interpretation.  Not intrusive or pervasive, nor idiotic or pedantic like some of the more superfluous commentaries I've heard (I.E. Warwick Davis in Willow, quaint but I'd rather hear from Ron Howard thank you).Disc 2:  This disc is packed with about 5+ hours of extras from a 30-minute long behind the scenes with the director to in depth interviews with all of the major cast members from Gene Hackman to Owen Wilson about the details of each character and their part in the whole Tenenbaum Tragicomedy.  It also includes many stills and a couple of sections that show the artwork of Eric Anderson's wall paintings that were used in the house.The Bad:  There were only two things that bothered me.  First, if you are going to put ""outtakes"" on the box, then show some.  There were two somewhat funny shots of between take action and one REAL outtake that wasn't really that funny.  Slap on the wrist Criterion, you can do better than that.  Second, ""The Peter Bradley Show: Interviews with the other cast members"" - which is based off of ""The Peter Bradley Show"" that's used in the movie - is a waste of good DVD space.  Personally, this section did nothing for me and wasn't really all that interesting.  They could have saved the room for some actual outtakes rather than making them Easter eggs, especially in a movie that passes itself off as a comedy, even if it's a dark one.  Hell, Death to Smoochy had more outtakes!The Final Word:  Minor issues aside, this is one that should be in every DVD collection.  A great film and a great DVD set.

697904,AO19QQOF7E2SX,B0000640VJ,roger,"[63, 68]","Wes Anderson's ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" exists on a knife edge between comedy and sadness. There are big laughs, and then quiet moments when we're touched. Sometimes we grin at the movie's deadpan audacity. The film doesn't want us to feel just one set of emotions. It's the story of a family who at times could have been created by P.G. Wodehouse, and at other times by John Irving. And it's proof that Anderson and his writing partner, the actor Owen Wilson, have a gift of cockeyed genius.The Tenenbaums occupy a big house in a kind of dreamy New York. It has enough rooms for each to hide and nurture a personality incompatible with the others. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), the patriarch, left home abruptly some years before and has been living in a hotel, on credit, ever since. There was never actually a divorce. His wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) remains at home with their three children, who were all child prodigies and have grown into adult neurotics. There's Chas (Ben Stiller), who was a financial whiz as a kid; Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), who was adopted, and won a big prize for writing a school play, and Richie (Luke Wilson), once a tennis champion.All three come with various partners, children and friends. The most memorable are Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), a bearded intellectual who has been married to Margot for years but does not begin to know her; Eli Cash (Owen Wilson), who lived across the street, became like a member of the family, and writes best-selling Westerns that get terrible reviews; Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), who was Etheline's accountant for 10 years until they suddenly realized they were in love, and such satellites as Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal's faithful servant (who once in India tried to murder Royal and then rescued him from ... himself ...) and the bellboy Dusty (Seymour Cassel), who impersonates a doctor when Royal fakes a fatal illness.Trying to understand the way this flywheel comedy tugs at the heartstrings, I reflected that eccentricity often masks deep loneliness. All the Tenenbaums are islands entire of themselves. Consider that Margot has been a secret smoker since she was 12. Why bother? Nobody else in the family cares, and when they discover her deception they hardly notice. Her secrecy was part of her own strategy to stand outside the family, to have something that was her own.One of the pleasures of the movie is the way it keeps us a little uncertain about how we should be reacting. It's like a guy who seems to be putting you on, and then suddenly reveals himself as sincere, so you're stranded out there with an inappropriate smirk. You can see this quality on screen in a lot of Owen Wilson's roles--in the half-kidding, half-serious way he finds out just how far he can push people.The movie's strategy of doubling back on its own emotions works mostly through the dialogue. Consider a sort of brilliant dinner-table conversation where Royal tells the family he has cancer, they clearly don't believe him (or care), he says he wants to get to know them before he dies, the bitter Chas says he's not interested in that, and Royal pulls out all the stops by suggesting they visit their grandmother. Now watch how it works. Chas and Richie haven't seen her since they were 6. Margot says piteously that she has never met her. Royal responds not with sympathy but with a slap at her adopted status: ""She wasn't your real grandmother."" See how his appeal turns on a dime into a cruel put-down? Anderson's previous movies were ""Bottle Rocket"" (1996) and ""Rushmore"" (1998), both offbeat comedies, both about young people trying to outwit institutions. Anderson and the Wilson brothers met at the University of Texas, made their first film on a shoestring, have quickly developed careers, and share a special talent. (That Owen Wilson could co-write and star in this, and also star in the lugubrious ""Behind Enemy Lines,"" is one of the year's curiosities.) Like the Farrelly brothers, but kinder and gentler, they follow a logical action to its outrageous conclusion.Consider, for example, what happens after Royal gets bounced out of his latest hotel and moves back home. His wife doesn't want him and Chas despises him (for stealing from his safety deposit box), so Royal stealthily moves in with a hospital bed, intravenous tubes, private medical care, and Seymour Cassel shaking his head over the prognosis. When this strategy is unmasked, he announces he wants to get to know his grandkids better--wants to teach them to take chances. So he instructs Chas' kids in shoplifting, playing in traffic and throwing things at taxicabs.""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is at heart profoundly silly, and loving. That's why it made me think of Wodehouse. It stands in amazement as the Tenenbaums and their extended family unveil one strategy after another to get attention, carve out space, and find love. It doesn't mock their efforts, dysfunctional as they are, because it understands them--and sympathizes.",5,"profoundly silly, and loving",1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,4982,"['Wes', 'Anderson',

They thought, ""Ben Stiller in an athletic suit with a bad haircut? Oh, yeah, this oughta be funny!"" I certainly was expecting slapstick too. I had forgotten who directed the movie. But I settled right in anyway to the fact that I was not going to bust a gut watching this. The Royal Tenenbaums is the newest, most hi-profile addition to the genre of independent tragicomedy, the kind of stuff that say, Todd Solondz and the Coens do that's really odd, but you don't want to laugh too hard, because the characters are having a time of it. Wes Anderson, the director of the movie, has given this genre Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. Rushmore is his crowning achievement so far, but Tenenbaums is no slouch. Sorry if you didn't laugh like a hyena during the movie. Sorry if you couldn't deal with what this film was instead of what it wasn't-you've probably missed one of the more well done films of last year. Now I hate saying things like that, because I hate movie snobs. I don't like everything that is 'independent' or 'arty'. I just think some people rented or went to the wrong movie. Those of us who recognize the genre and like it, will be quite satisfied with this portrait of a wealthy, gifted family that splinters into eccentricity due to a lack of guidance and love by its patriarch, and the sly way he tries to sneak back into their strange lives by faking terminal illness.

697907,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B0000640VJ,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 5]","""The Royal Tennenbaums"" is not a comedy that will appeal to everybody. The titular family, ruled by Gene Hackman (Royal Tennenbaum) and Anjelica Huston, was split between the conflicting forces of their prodigal children, but mostly due to Royal's relentless opportunism. Chas (Stiller) was a brilliant businessman by the age of nine - looking and living the part (his bedroom looks more like an office than somebody's bedroom, complete with linoleum). Richie (Luke Wilson, though unrecognizable behind beard and glasses for much of the film) was a tennis champ who turned pro by 17. Margot (Paltrow), Royal's adopted daughter, was an award-winning playwright by 11. By the start of the flick, they're all grown-up and damaged in some way or another - Richie's secret love for Margot has destroyed his tennis career, while Margot is all but clinically depressed and creatively blocked. The death of Chas's wife in a private airplane crash has turned him compulsively safe. Royal, disbarred and briefly imprisoned (we learn that Chas had Royal disbarred, and his half of the house expropriated) is out of cash, and is forced to return to the little house on Orchard Street.  Royal manages to worm his way back claiming he's dying of stomach cancer, and the family only reluctantly takes him back. Though Chas loudly opposes the family's having anything to do with Royal, only Danny Glover, as a romantic contender for Mrs. Tennenbaum, is able to see through Royal's schemes.If you've seen ""Rushmore"", then you'll find Wes Anderson's direction here strikingly. (meandering plot lines, understated characters and a script that is light handed to the point of being non-existent) Of course the cinematography is the clearest link between the two - with many scenes being less scenes than simply snapshots in which there is movement. (I think Anderson's point is that his characters are people whose achievements have eclipsed their identities, so much that they're lives easily boil down to the quick bios found behind their books, but that's just my blathering take on it all).  Not a lot really makes sense in this film - Royal first returns home because he's out on the street, but he tries to worm his way into their lives as well, only increasing the chances that they'll be fed up enough to see through his lies.  Richie is destroyed by Margot's marriage to a professional melancholic played by Bill Murray, but we soon learn that she was famously unfaithful, almost following a compulsive infidelity already - so why did she marry? Chas hates Royal for many reasons, though we're not sure which has cemented their bad blood (a BB, permanently lodged in Chas's hand when he was shot by Royal, doesn't quite explain things; Chas is more affected by his wife's death, though that's got nothing to do with Royal). Eli Cash (Owen Wilson), who grew up across the street from the Tennenbaums, is a bigger mystery - it seems that he harbored a love of Margot himself, but that was a mystery to her even by the time he's foresworn her.  Though inwardly envious of the Tennenbaum's for the sake of being simply a Tennenbaum which is weird enough, Cash has no connection in the film to Royal, who has made the family everything it is.  Hopelessly hooked on Mescaline (climaxing in a tragic act of recklessness at the movie's end), Eli's place in the film, so unconnected with its other characters, is hard to explain. He gives the film some much needed energy, but little else.The biggest mistake is how the script tries to create a multitude of characters patterned after Max from ""Rushmore"" (Max loves attending the elite prep school, Rushmore, even though he's a hopeless academic failure; He lives just to be near his cozy school, much as the characters here long to return to the family home, but little more than that. ""Rushmore"" worked because Max's quirks seemed so out of place and wonderfully highlighted against the rest of the world in that film. Here, everybody is as nutty and directionless as Max. For that reason, I can't really recommend this flick unless you've already seen and loved ""Rushmore"". Otherwise, you'll be staring numb at your tube for 110 minutes wondering why you're not laughing.",3,"Not a film you'll like unless you loved ""Rushmore""",1028505600,"08 5, 2002",2002,4204,"['Royal', 'Tennenbaums', 'not', 'comedy', 'will', 'appeal', 'everybody', 'titular', 'family', 'ruled', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Royal', 'Tennenbaum', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'was', 'split', 'conflicting', 'forces', 'prodigal', 'children', 'mostly', 'due', 'Royal', 'relentless', 'opportunism', 'Chas', 'Stiller', 'was', 'brilliant', 'businessman', 'age', 'nine', 'looking', 'living', 'part', 'bedroom', 'more', 'office', 'somebody', 'bedroom', 'complete', 'linoleum', 'Richie', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'unrecognizable', 'beard', 'glasses', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'tennis', 'champ', 'who', 'turned', 'pro', '17', 'Margot', 'Paltrow', 'Royal', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'was', 'award-winning', 'playwright', '11', 'start', 'flick', ""'re"", 'grown-up', 'damaged', 'way', 'Richie', 'secret', 'love', 'Margot', 'destroyed', 'tennis', 'career', 'Margot', 'clinically', 'depressed', 'creatively', 'blocked', 'death', 'Chas', 'wife', 'private', 'airplane', 'crash', 'turned', 'compulsively', 'safe', 'Royal', 'disbarred', 'briefly', 'imprisoned', 'learn', 'Chas', 'had', 'Royal', 'disbarred', 'half', 'house', 'expropriated', 'cash', 'forced', 'return', 'little', 'house', 'Orchard', 'Street', 'Royal', 'worm', 'way', 'back', 'claiming', 'dying', 'stomach', 'cancer', 'family', 'only', 'reluctantly', 'back', 'Though', 'Chas', 'loudly', 'family', 'having', 'anything', 'do', 'Royal', 'only', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'romantic', 'contender', 'Mrs.', 'Tennenbaum', 'able', 'see', 'Royal', 'schemes.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Rushmore', 'then', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'direction', 'here', 'strikingly', 'meandering', 'plot', 'lines', 'understated', 'characters', 'script', 'light', 'handed', 'point', 'being', 'non-existent', 'course', 'cinematography', 'clearest', 'link', 'two', 'many', 'scenes', 'being', 'less', 'scenes', 'simply', 'snapshots', 'movement', 'think', 'Anderson', 'point', 'characters', 'are', 'people', 'achievements', 'have', 'eclipsed', 'identities', 'so', 'much', ""'re"", 'lives', 'easily', 'boil', 'down', 'quick', 'bios', 'found', 'books', 'just', 'blathering', 'take', 'Not', 'lot', 'really', 'sense', 'film', 'Royal', 'first', 'home', 'out', 'street', 'worm', 'way', 'lives', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'increasing', 'chances', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fed', 'up', 'enough', 'see', 'lies', 'Richie', 'destroyed', 'Margot', 'marriage', 'professional', 'melancholic', 'played', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'soon', 'learn', 'was', 'famously', 'unfaithful', 'almost', 'following', 'compulsive', 'infidelity', 'already', 'so', 'why', 'did', 'marry', 'Chas', 'Royal', 'many', 'reasons', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'cemented', 'bad', 'blood', 'BB', 'permanently', 'lodged', 'Chas', 'hand', 'when', 'was', 'shot', 'Royal', ""n't"", 'quite', 'explain', 'things', 'Chas', 'more', 'affected', 'wife', 'death', 'got', 'nothing', 'do', 'Royal', 'Eli', 'Cash', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'street', 'Tennenbaums', 'bigger', 'mystery', 'harbored', 'love', 'Margot', 'was', 'mystery', 'even', 'time', 'foresworn', 'inwardly', 'envious', 'Tennenbaum', 'sake', 'being', 'simply', 'Tennenbaum', 'weird', 'enough', 'Cash', 'connection', 'film', 'Royal', 'who', 'made', 'family', 'everything', 'Hopelessly', 'hooked', 'Mescaline', 'climaxing', 'tragic', 'act', 'recklessness', 'movie', 'end', 'Eli', 'place', 'film', 'so', 'unconnected', 'other', 'characters', 'hard', 'explain', 'film', 'much', 'needed', 'energy', 'little', 'else.The', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'how', 'script', 'create', 'multitude', 'characters', 'patterned', 'Max', 'Rushmore', 'Max', 'attending', 'elite', 'prep', 'school', 'Rushmore', 'even', 'hopeless', 'academic', 'failure', 'just', 'be', 'cozy', 'school', 'much', 'characters', 'here', 'long', 'return', 'family', 'home', 'little', 'more', 'Rushmore', 'worked', 'Max', 'quirks', 'seemed', 'so', 'place', 'wonderfully', 'highlighted', 'rest', 'world', 'film', 'Here', 'everybody', 'nutty', 'directionless', 'Max', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'loved', 'Rushmore', 'Otherwise', ""'ll"", 'be', 'staring', 'numb', 'tube', '110', 'minutes', 'wondering', 'why', ""'re"", 'not', 'laughing']",The Royal Tenenbaums

Nevertheless this movie doesn't quite cohere.  At times if feels as if art direction is its priority, rather than character or story, and the actors, though wonderful in some scenes, seem in others only to be posed to convey a mood.  Tennenbaums often resembles a series of portraits rather than a narrative.

Director Wes Anderson follows up the outstanding RUSHMORE by bringing his unique vision to the dysfunctional Tannenbaum family.  Presented as a cross between a fable and a documentery, the film is both a comedy and a drama.There are outstanding performances by Gene Hackman as the father trying to reintegrate himself into the family after years of absence, Angelica Houston playing the mother who had kept the family together and Luke Wilson, Gwenyth Paltrow and Ben Stiller as the children, all who had acheived great things in their youth only to fail upon reaching adulthood.  Owen Wilson plays the neighbor and family friend who also has acheived success as an author only to see it slip away.  Danny Glover gives an excellent performance as the accountant/suitor of Mrs. Tannenbaum. The only flaw in the film is that Bill Murray who was so great in RUSHMORE does not seem to well utilized in his charecter here as Gweyth Paltrow's suffering husband.The humor in the film is understated and subtle with a surreal element woven into it. The jokes are not set up and then delivered, but are casually observed in the interactions of the charecters or sometimes as visuals in the background. The superb soundtrack and cinematography are essential to the success of the films mood.I would highly recommend this, however with a warning.  If you are a fan of comedy of a broad nature or are expecting a riveting family portrait, you may be disappointed.  This is a unique film which requires the viewer to meet it on it's own terms, which is not standard Hollywood procedure.

In fact, the movie's greatest assets rest in the untold and unexplained bits of the film and the tongue-in-cheek stabs at all of the characters, people (with the exception of Pagoda, The Butler) who have been taking themselves way too seriously for way too long and their discomfort around their father, a man who never took anyone seriously in his life, least of all himself.

Royal Tenenbaum is the father of genius children, that really do not like him.  He is a self centered, manipulating jerk.  He was an attorney until he got disbarred.  You have the children, very depressing Margot who is a playwright.  Richie is a tennis pro, and Chas who is a finance genius and father of two boys.  He is a widower and very, very protective of his sons.  They were raised by Etheline their mom.  Despite their success, they all wish they had that family dynamic that is missing in their lives.  When Royal gets kicked out of the hotel he was living in, he schemes his way back into his family?s life by claiming he is sick.  The family is living together in the house and still trying to maintain their own lives, while dad is attempting to make up for all his wrong doings.  Etheline is engaged to Henry Sherman and Royal is doing everything to prevent that marriage from happening.  Will the family ever come to terms with the problems in the family or will they remain at odds with each other?  Owen Wilson co-wrote and was Executive Producer of this film in addition to acting in the movie.Though the movie had a wonderful cast, I felt the movie dragged on and I started to lose interest quick.  I was not drawn into any of the characters or their plot lines at all.  I did not feel sorry for anyone, and was at the point where I just wanted the movie to end.  Even when Chas had his crisis happen, he bounced back so quick you did not have time to even respond to what he did to himself.  The emotion displayed in the movie was so misplaced.  The film was just dull.  It?s categorized as a comedy, but I think it?s more of a dark comedy.

Royal Tennenbaum (Hackman) tries to work his way back into his ex-wife's and children's lives after years of distance and neglect.  While there isn't one really redeemable character in the whole movie, the movie's one cohesive theme is redemption of character.  The one complaint I had with the film was that Stiller, Paltrow, and Wilson portrayed the grown children as having endured years of electroshock and antipsychotic drug therapy. Zombie flat.  I found it hard to relate to their emotions, or better put - lack of emotions. But to be fair, these characters are written as severely damaged goods.  Hackman turns in one of the finest, three-dimensional roles of his career.

The sound track is superb, one of the best I have heard in years.  This is the second film this year that I have fallen in love with a house (the first being ""Gosford Park"").  The Tanenbaum manse is a marvelous turreted Victorian pile with stunning windows, bow fronts, and room upon mysterious room.Synopses made me think of Kaufman &amp; Hart's ""You Can't Take It With You"" and Shaw's ""Heartbreak House"" two brilliant and hilarious bittersweet plays featuring wildly dysfunctional, genius-grade eccentric families.  I couldn't wait to see what such a stellar cast would do with the premise.""The Royal Tenenbaums"" contains disparate set pieces lacking a link to tie them together.  The cast, with the exception of Ben Stiller, was likable sometimes lovable individually but nothing seemed to tie them together.  I felt as if I were watching individual stand-ups where the actors mailed in their performances without interacting at all.  Gene Hackman seemed to sense the flaw and used his marvelous skills subtly to cast a net of connectedness through the story, but was thwarted by the storyline.  I thought of the 100,000 starving talented actors who could have more than adequately filled the roles that were wasted on Danny Glover, Bill Murray, and Gwnyth Paltrow.  Sight gags (which was in essence Paltrow's entire role) can enhance a film but cannot carry it.  The best sequence in the film was Hackman taking his grandsons on a totally inappropriate Afternoon Outing.  It sparkled with fun, action, and a series of quick shots that breathed life into a movie that badly needed it.Anjelica Huston was wonderfully eccentric; Hackman was comic, rough and endearing, and a very special nod to Stephen Lea Sheppard as Dudley Heinsbergen, Bill Murray's truly weird test subject.Sorry, I really wanted to like this movie.",3,Great Expectations,1027036800,"07 19, 2002",2002,1946,"['regretted', 'missing', 'big', 'screen', 'version', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'feel', 'fortunate', 'such', 'fine', 'DVD', 'rendition', 'sound', 'track', 'superb', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'heard', 'years', 'second', 'film', 'year', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'house', 'first', 'being', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'Tanenbaum', 'manse', 'marvelous', 'turreted', 'Victorian', 'pile', 'stunning', 'windows', 'bow', 'fronts', 'room', 'mysterious', 'room.Synopses', 'made', 'think', 'Kaufman', 'amp', 'Hart', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'Shaw', 'Heartbreak', 'House', 'two', 'brilliant', 'hilarious', 'bittersweet', 'plays', 'featuring', 'wildly', 'dysfunctional', 'genius-grade', 'eccentric', 'families', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'stellar', 'cast', 'would', 'do', 'premise', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'disparate', 'set', 'pieces', 'lacking', 'link', 'tie', 'together', 'cast', 'exception', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'was', 'likable', 'sometimes', 'lovable', 'individually', 'nothing', 'seemed', 'tie', 'together', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'individual', 'stand-ups', 'where', 'actors', 'mailed', 'performances', 'interacting', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'seemed', 'sense', 'flaw', 'used', 'marvelous', 'skills', 'subtly', 'cast', 'net', 'connectedness', 'story', 'was', 'thwarted', 'storyline', 'thought', '100,000', 'starving', 'talented', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'more', 'adequately', 'filled', 'roles', 'were', 'wasted', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Gwnyth', 'Paltrow', 'Sight', 'gags', 'was', 'essence', 'Paltrow', 'entire', 'role', 'can', 'enhance', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'carry', 'best', 'sequence', 'film', 'was', 'Hackman', 'taking', 'grandsons', 'totally', 'inappropriate', 'Afternoon', 'Outing', 'sparkled', 'fun', 'action', 'series', 'quick', 'shots', 'breathed', 'life', 'movie', 'badly', 'needed', 'it.Anjelica', 'Huston', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'eccentric', 'Hackman', 'was', 'comic', 'rough', 'endearing', 'very', 'special', 'nod', 'Stephen', 'Lea', 'Sheppard', 'Dudley', 'Heinsbergen', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'truly', 'weird', 'test', 'subject.Sorry', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie']",The Royal Tenenbaums

The story has been described by many people, so I will just say that this is one of those movies where the story dosen't really matter because you are so enamored by the characters.  This movie is basically a character study but with a whole family and their various friends, children, and spouses.  Everything about the set, the costumes, and the way the actors portray their characters is  fairy tale like and almost seems like a metaphor for something more ordinary, but is just beautiful and filled with tiny details that draw you into their world with an open heart.The movie is wonderfully written and acted, although some people may not get the humor or may be expecting easy laughs, so they will not really &quot;get&quot; or enjoy the movie because they don't know what to think. For the most part, this movie does not dictate to the audience what is funny about it, and it does not dictate who to like and what to think about the film.  This leaves some less patient audience members feeling unsatisfied and like they have missed something, which they have.  Many people I know who have seen this movie are expecting Ben Stiller ala There's Something About Mary, or Bill Murray ala Ghostbusters, but this is not the usual &quot;popular comedy&quot; sort of performance these actors give in this movie.  Bill Murray says nothing directly funny at all, he just mopes around with a beard and a patient named Dudley, which is only funny if you take his character as a whole and stop to notice the subtle humor in his character and how he reacts to what goes on. It is the same for all the characters.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who will appreciate a quirky, complex, understated dramedy, because the experience will stay with you for a long time.",5,a beautiful film that may not be appreciated by everyone,1085529600,"05 26, 2004",2004,1888,"['Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'beatiful', 'movie', 'very', 'full', 'life', 'graced', 'poetic', 'characters', 'story', 'been', 'described', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'story', 'dose', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'are', 'so', 'enamored', 'characters', 'movie', 'basically', 'character', 'study', 'whole', 'family', 'various', 'friends', 'children', 'spouses', 'Everything', 'set', 'costumes', 'way', 'actors', 'portray', 'characters', 'fairy', 'tale', 'almost', 'metaphor', 'something', 'more', 'ordinary', 'just', 'beautiful', 'filled', 'tiny', 'details', 'draw', 'world', 'open', 'heart.The', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'acted', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'humor', 'may', 'be', 'expecting', 'easy', 'laughs', 'will', 'not', 'really', 'quot', 'get', 'quot', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'not', 'dictate', 'audience', 'what', 'funny', 'not', 'dictate', 'who', 'like', 'what', 'think', 'film', 'less', 'patient', 'audience', 'members', 'feeling', 'unsatisfied', 'have', 'missed', 'something', 'have', 'Many', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'are', 'expecting', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Something', 'Mary', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'ala', 'Ghostbusters', 'not', 'usual', 'quot', 'popular', 'comedy', 'quot', 'sort', 'performance', 'actors', 'give', 'movie', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'nothing', 'directly', 'funny', 'just', 'around', 'beard', 'patient', 'named', 'Dudley', 'only', 'funny', 'take', 'character', 'whole', 'stop', 'notice', 'subtle', 'humor', 'character', 'how', 'what', 'same', 'characters', 'Overall', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'appreciate', 'quirky', 'complex', 'understated', 'dramedy', 'experience', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time']",The Royal Tenenbaums

This is exactly the case here with the &quot;Royal Tenenbaums&quot;.There is a cast at hand which needs no introductions: Gene Hackman, Angelica Houston, Paltrow etc. There is the idea of making all of them members of an ultra weird family (the Tenenbaums). This, providing the right script, should amount to a wacky comedy with subtle but also dark humor, a film that should be able to take on the best &quot;indies&quot; out there.But that never happens. Primarily because the biggest joke on this candidate comedy is the script itself.It's a story that never takes off really and tires even the most patient of viewers as they wait for something to finally happen. Hackman, as usual, produces another great performance, Angelica Houston is great, and that's about the only two reasons why i watched this film even though it drags painfully and pointlessly.The problem is that it doesn't matter whether you got a couple of great actors on your cast doing their darn best.

It wasn't very funny.  Some have said it was a drama, which is probably the closest one could come to categorizing it, though that is far from an exact fit.  The longer, more accurate, description would be slightly funny, slightly dramatic American 'art film'.While I am far from in love with this film, there is a certain appeal to it that made watching enjoyable enough.  It takes place in a sort of fantasy New York, being defined by no strict geography or time period.  For that, it was a visually interesting movie. I loved the old fashioned elevator operators and their uniforms.Perhaps, if there is anything to relate to, it is the nutty, strange, and yet common craziness that tends to pervade families.

And for those of you who aren't sure, you can actually dislike this movie even if your IQ is above 85.  :)  I generally enjoy controversy in the reviews, but the elitism shown in these reviews is simply wretched.For those who don't know, the story is about the reunion of Royal Tenenbaum (Hackman) and his dysfunctional family (Huston, Stiller, Paltrow, and  Luke Wilson).  When his 3 children were young, Royal was a critical, unstable father who played favorites.  Though all of the children were geniuses, they all came undone by their 30's due to their father's dispiriting influence and mother's detached upbringing.Right as all 3 children were hitting their lowest lows in their 30's, Royal gets kicked out of his housing because he has no money.  He schemes his way back into their lives, and so all 5 are living under one roof again, with the notorious neighbor (Owen Wilson) still nearby.  Will reconciliation ever happen?  Should it happen?  Does Royal actually care?The movie allows the characters to breath - it allows them to be complex and mysterious and irrational.  It also allows for a subtle ironic and circumstantial humor.However, that said, I thought the movie dragged quite a bit and was ultimately very empty.  There was little in it that engaged me emotionally; I was not drawn into any one character's plotline  (let alone all of them).  I didn't need closure because I didn't care, and I'd rather the story have ended sooner.  Even the very poignant (though twisted) moment of Luke Wilson's crisis was trivialized as things bounce back to &quot;normal&quot; so quickly.As a final criticism, the movie had unnecessary (though brief) nudity.  I think I should have expected it in this movie, but it could have easily been left out.  All in all, some subset of movie watchers might really enjoy the unique journey of this film.

This movie is like no other that I have seen.  I usually do not like narrated films, but luckily, there was not enough to ruin this movie.  The characters are developed nicely from youth to adult age.  We are allowed a look at the past to see why they are the way they are in the present.  The name of the movie comes from the Character of Gene Hackman, who plays Royal Tenebaums.  Once a pone a time, being a Tenenbaum really meant something, but after two decades of misfortune, they have all but been forgotten for their brilliance.  The body of this movie takes place in the present when all the children are not only grown up, but messed up in the head as well.  When Mrs. Tenebaum is proposed to, Royal seeks to reunite with his family in hopes to break up his wife and her new found love and win her back.  After pretending to be dying, Royal moves back in with his wife (all the children due to their own special circumstances, have also moved back home.)  Once the family finds out that Royal is not dying, he is kicked out on the streets.  Royal realizes that the past six days he has spent with his family have been the best of his life.

In fact, there is more that is funny, more to see, better characters and wittier dialog than ""Rushmore"" had.The humor is so layered that I found myself laughing at something an hour later when thinking over a scene in the movie from a different perspective. My partner thought that I was crazy on the drive home in the car as I quoted one particular line and laughed my head off.I'm certain that this movie won't appeal to everyone. It isn't an everyman movie, although it certainly has enough surface humor to be somewhat amusing to almost anyone. It really is something that you have to pay close attention to in order to appreciate. I'm sure that there's lots that I missed, although I'll be seeing it again on video or DVD.One of the unusual things in the movie that I only got late: While all the cars, cloths, houses, styles are stuck in the 70's, the movie definitely seems set in 2001, since there are lots of indicators to let you know this. The family is stuck in the past.Some of the best dialog is from the narrator, superbly voiced by Alec Baldwin. He had the very best line in the entire movie and lots of other stingers. I would love to listen to only the narration all the way though. In fact, one of the weaknesses of the movie was not having the narrator narrate each and every ""chapter"" of the movie.The last movie that had me lauging this way was the Coen brother movie ""The Big Lebowski"".

697945,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000640VJ,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","After all, the title tells everything: it's about the Tenenbaums, one strange dysfunctional family with the perhaps best collection of oddball characters in recent years.  But unlike director Wes Anderson's previous work ""Rushmore,"" the new film lacks one thing: story.  So, be warned: this is not our usual laugh-out-loud comedy, but it certainly tickles your funny bones ... if you're in the mood.  If you're not ... , then you won't laugh in the next ten years.And if you have seen some good American movies made since the 70s, or just happen to know the name of Gene Hackman, you soon realize that he is the best thing of the show, and actually he is.  Hackman charmingly plays the sire of the family, the most irreponsible father Royal Tenenbaum, who returns to his home after 22 years, now deprived of his license of a lawyer, and severely short of money, kicked out of the hotel he had been living in.Now, the time has come for the reunion of the former members of the family, ex-genious children: Paltrow, Stiller, and Luke Wilson.  Surrounding the dying father (so he insists), they somehow start to heal the old wounds (including that of BB guns) received during the childhood ...It is Hackman that you always are attracted to, inspite of his personality, and it is only natural, considering his talent.  But other actors are also good, particularly Paltrow with black eyelids, whose shady past full of secrets (and married to Bill Murrey!) is recounted in a short flashback with a Ramones song ""Judy is a Punk.""  This is the moment Wes Anderson is at  his best, showing witty, playful skills of his own.But there are some flaws in the film, and one of them is that clearly the film is overcrowded with too many chracaters, and because of that, the story gets behind these portraits, getting thinner than that of ""Rushmore,"" which revolves around the hilarious, entangled relations between Jason Schuwartzman - Olivia Williams - Bill Murrey.  In the new film Bill Murrey's role doesn't mean much, and those of Owen and Luke Wilson just don't function well, compared with that of Hackman and Angelica Huston.  Some intrguing themes (like the near-incest relation between sister and brother) are taken up, and then left unsolved, and when we see these flaws, we remember the tight, original structure of ""Rushmore.""After all, this is a unique version of unique family by one od the most unique directors in America.  There are lots of reference to the films in the past, as the signature of the post-Tarantino generations, but Anderson's film is consciously avoiding making it come to the forefront.  Instead, he presents his original view of the family with his meticulously designed photography.  This film may not suit everyone's taste as a comedy, but as a drama it still has universal appeal as long as how Royal Tenenbaum and his family act under this not-so-usual situations.",4,Strangely Funny But Not Exactly Everybody's Cup of Tea,1033948800,"10 7, 2002",2002,2890,"['title', 'everything', 'Tenenbaums', 'one', 'strange', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'perhaps', 'best', 'collection', 'oddball', 'characters', 'recent', 'years', 'director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'previous', 'work', 'Rushmore', 'new', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'story', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'usual', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'funny', 'bones', ""'re"", 'mood', ""'re"", 'not', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'next', 'ten', 'years.And', 'have', 'seen', 'good', 'American', 'movies', 'made', '70s', 'just', 'happen', 'know', 'name', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'soon', 'realize', 'best', 'thing', 'show', 'actually', 'Hackman', 'charmingly', 'sire', 'family', 'most', 'irreponsible', 'father', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'who', 'home', '22', 'years', 'now', 'deprived', 'license', 'lawyer', 'severely', 'short', 'money', 'kicked', 'hotel', 'had', 'been', 'living', 'in.Now', 'time', 'come', 'reunion', 'former', 'members', 'family', 'ex-genious', 'children', 'Paltrow', 'Stiller', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Surrounding', 'dying', 'father', 'somehow', 'start', 'heal', 'old', 'wounds', 'including', 'BB', 'guns', 'received', 'childhood', 'Hackman', 'always', 'are', 'attracted', 'inspite', 'personality', 'only', 'natural', 'considering', 'talent', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'particularly', 'Paltrow', 'black', 'eyelids', 'shady', 'full', 'secrets', 'married', 'Bill', 'Murrey', 'recounted', 'short', 'flashback', 'Ramones', 'song', 'Judy', 'Punk', 'moment', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'best', 'showing', 'witty', 'playful', 'skills', 'own.But', 'are', 'flaws', 'film', 'one', 'clearly', 'film', 'overcrowded', 'too', 'many', 'chracaters', 'story', 'portraits', 'getting', 'thinner', 'Rushmore', 'hilarious', 'entangled', 'relations', 'Jason', 'Schuwartzman', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Bill', 'Murrey', 'new', 'film', 'Bill', 'Murrey', 'role', ""n't"", 'mean', 'much', 'Owen', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'function', 'well', 'compared', 'Hackman', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'intrguing', 'themes', 'near-incest', 'relation', 'sister', 'brother', 'are', 'taken', 'up', 'then', 'left', 'unsolved', 'when', 'see', 'flaws', 'remember', 'tight', 'original', 'structure', 'Rushmore', 'unique', 'version', 'unique', 'family', 'one', 'od', 'most', 'unique', 'directors', 'America', 'are', 'lots', 'reference', 'films', 'past', 'signature', 'post-Tarantino', 'generations', 'Anderson', 'film', 'consciously', 'avoiding', 'making', 'come', 'forefront', 'Instead', 'original', 'view', 'family', 'meticulously', 'designed', 'photography', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'suit', 'everyone', 'taste', 'comedy', 'drama', 'still', 'universal', 'appeal', 'as', 'long', 'how', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'family', 'act', 'not-so-usual', 'situations']",The Royal Tenenbaums

The movie revolves around a rich, but extremely eccentric man name Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman).  Royal and his wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) had three children:  Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson).  In the 1970s the Tenenbaums were one of America's premier families:  Margot was a famous playwright, Richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive U.S. Nationals, and Chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen.  That was almost thirty years ago and the Tenenbaums have largely been forgotten.  Betrayal, failure, and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died.  What's worse is that Royal's children and wife blame him for all their failures.  Royal senses that his time is Earth is waning and he wishes to set things right.  With the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend, Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family's eyes.I'm a pretty big fan of Wes Anderson and have seen all four of his films.  THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is Anderson's most critically acclaimed and his most popular picture.  However, it is my least favorite of his movies.  Like all Anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and witty dialogue.  The film is about the redemption of a man in the eyes of his family, a theme that I enjoy.  Yet, the film just didn't resonate with me as much as Anderson's other pictures.  I really don't know why that is.  That's not to say THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is a bad movie because it's not.  In addition to everything else mention it also has some good acting, brilliant set designs, etc.  I just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic-drama about a sea-voyaging documentarian instead.",4,"Rich, Brilliant, Quirky, but Dysfunctional Family.",1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,1977,"['ROYAL', 'TENENBAUMS', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'third', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'movie', 'rich', 'extremely', 'eccentric', 'man', 'name', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaum', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Royal', 'wife', 'Etheline', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'had', 'three', 'children', 'Chas', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Margot', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Richie', 'Luke', 'Wilson', '1970s', 'Tenenbaums', 'were', 'one', 'America', 'premier', 'families', 'Margot', 'was', 'famous', 'playwright', 'Richie', 'was', 'junior', 'tennis', 'champion', 'who', 'later', 'won', 'three', 'consecutive', 'U.S.', 'Nationals', 'Chas', 'started', 'first', 'real', 'estate', 'business', 'early', 'age', 'earning', 'first', 'million', 'dollars', 'was', 'thirteen', 'was', 'almost', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'Tenenbaums', 'have', 'largely', 'been', 'forgotten', 'Betrayal', 'failure', 'disaster', 'have', 'haunted', 'family', 'laurels', 'youthful', 'days', 'have', 'withered', 'died', 'What', 'worse', 'Royal', 'children', 'wife', 'blame', 'failures', 'Royal', 'time', 'Earth', 'waning', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'assistance', 'faithful', 'servant', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'Pagoda', 'Kumar', 'Pallana', 'Royal', 'motion', 'plan', 'redeem', 'family', 'eyes.I', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'big', 'fan', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'have', 'seen', 'four', 'films', 'ROYAL', 'TENENBAUMS', 'Anderson', 'most', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'most', 'popular', 'picture', 'However', 'least', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Anderson', 'films', 'movie', 'filled', 'quirky', 'characters', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'film', 'redemption', 'man', 'eyes', 'family', 'theme', 'enjoy', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'as', 'much', 'Anderson', 'other', 'pictures', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'not', 'say', 'THE', 'ROYAL', 'TENENBAUMS', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'addition', 'everything', 'else', 'mention', 'also', 'good', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'set', 'designs', 'etc', 'just', 'prefer', 'movie', 'thieve', 'brothers', 'film', 'precocious', 'teenage', 'genius', 'comic-drama', 'sea-voyaging', 'documentarian', 'instead']",The Royal Tenenbaums

Altman's films have a hit or miss quality. They are either marvelous, inventive and groundbreaking or hopeless messes full of arty pretense. Clearly the later group was an influence on Anderson and Wilson.It's pretentious and precious all at the same time and, the worst part is, the makers of the film knowingly wink at his as if somehow we'll benefit by participating in this inside joke. Whatever merits Rushmore had (and it did have quite a few despite a stodgy structure and predictable, uninvolving central character)doesn't translate to this film.The cast are all very good and it's clear why they took the roles--the characters are eccentric and rooted in their own corner of reality. That's the type of character that attracts Oscars and Academy attention come awards time. That's also the same problem with the film. It's a meandering mess full of predictable plot twists and outcomes.The cinematography is one of the few stand outs in this boring mess. The selection of music also works to offset some of the tedium. This isn't a horrible film just a self important one. What's most disturbing is the way a lot of critics and audience members (usually those that feel they have to ""get"" the film otherwise they're not cool)were sucked into this large, empty canvas. These are the same type of folks that would have gone to see Deep Throat in the 70's and pointed out its virtues.It's a pity as there are far more deserving films coming from indepedents that are virtually ignored. I'd recommend Rabbit Proof Fence instead of this meandering waste of time.
