So, the feel of the film is kinda like a Bad Lieutenant/Maniac/Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, types of movies. You feel like you need a shower after spending time with these characters. Most of the interactions between the characters seem natural, like you are peeping in on someone's (degenerate) life (degenerate is not an insult). The intensity of Joey's need to get to Jennifer forebodes something that 'something more than what meets the eye is afoot'. That, along with the conflictual situations he got into along the way, created an atmosphere of ' nothing good will come of this' that fully emerges around the 'latter middle to beginning of the end' part, when they stay at that condemned hotel when his friend goes home and lets him use the car. I knew that we had made a sharp left at that point and it did not disappoint from then on. The rest of the film exposed the deranged underbelly beneath the seemingly normal facade. I liked that. The movie is really not bad for what it is: a microbudget, independent, gritty/seamy/fringe walks of life, shot on iphone. You need to adjust your expectations bigtime if you expect anything like that to blow your mind. I appreciate the seamy, underbelly type characters, and the depraved and twisted stories that go along with them. There was nothing in the movie that severely undermined the effect it was going for. The acting was competent and the scenes were adequately shot. I've seen far, far, worse. For that I rounded up to a 4. I'm glad I grew up a horror fan in the golden age of horror, when we appreciated anything that was able to take us on a strange trip. I can only imagine if some of the classic B flicks that we loved back then had come out now. Horror viewers are such whiners nowadays.",4,"Horror Junkie's review: 3.5 really, a micro budget film about obsession",1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,1911,"['i', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'given', 'reviews', 'gave', 'shot', 'watching', 'not', 'prime', 'time', 'viewing', 'hours', 'had', 'do', 'mindless', 'tasks', 'So', 'feel', 'film', 'kinda', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant/Maniac/Henry', 'Portrait', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'types', 'movies', 'feel', 'need', 'shower', 'spending', 'time', 'characters', 'Most', 'interactions', 'characters', 'seem', 'natural', 'are', 'peeping', 'someone', 'degenerate', 'life', 'degenerate', 'not', 'insult', 'intensity', 'Joey', 'need', 'get', 'Jennifer', 'forebodes', 'something', ""'something"", 'more', 'what', 'eye', 'afoot', 'conflictual', 'situations', 'got', 'way', 'created', 'atmosphere', 'nothing', 'good', 'will', 'come', 'fully', ""'latter"", 'middle', 'beginning', 'end', 'part', 'when', 'stay', 'condemned', 'hotel', 'when', 'friend', 'home', 'use', 'car', 'knew', 'had', 'made', 'sharp', 'left', 'point', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'then', 'rest', 'film', 'exposed', 'deranged', 'underbelly', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'facade', 'liked', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'what', 'microbudget', 'independent', 'gritty/seamy/fringe', 'walks', 'life', 'shot', 'iphone', 'need', 'adjust', 'expectations', 'bigtime', 'expect', 'anything', 'blow', 'mind', 'appreciate', 'seamy', 'underbelly', 'type', 'characters', 'depraved', 'twisted', 'stories', 'go', 'along', 'was', 'nothing', 'movie', 'severely', 'undermined', 'effect', 'was', 'going', 'acting', 'was', 'competent', 'scenes', 'were', 'adequately', 'shot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'far', 'worse', 'rounded', 'up', '4', ""'m"", 'glad', 'grew', 'up', 'horror', 'fan', 'golden', 'age', 'horror', 'when', 'appreciated', 'anything', 'was', 'able', 'take', 'strange', 'trip', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'classic', 'B', 'flicks', 'loved', 'back', 'then', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'now', 'Horror', 'viewers', 'are', 'such', 'whiners', 'nowadays']",To Jennifer

Some things unravel at the end, but not in an overzealous way. After a moment you'll be thinking, so wait he, so how did, oh man! This is why watching TO JENNIFER a couple times is worth it. Plus, producer, writer, director, and editor James Cullen Bressack entertains us playing the role of Steven. Friends on a road trip all have their own personalities that can and will clash, but Steven always somehow made a bad situation comical with his sarcasm.You'll probably be able to relate some of your friends with the characters in the film. I felt like I was watching one of my friend's video from college. Except instead of IPhones, we had a video cameras that would rest on your shoulder.TO JENNIFER was actually believable, the mishaps, insulting and mocking each other, having fun and their commitment to helping a friend when their girlfriend cheats on them. As the film moves along, Joey's obsession and anger grows. We learn early by his panic attack on the plane that he's a little unstable. Therefore, his outbursts and reactions are believable, but not exaggerated too much.Just a few of my highlights:* I'm going to Google ""how to hack Facebook"" just like Joey did. It sounds so much easier to find out if your girlfriend is cheating on you than a stakeout.* Prostitute scene.

1659784,AQ2UN38CMK119,B00DNJ96KK,P. Mann,"[4, 5]","OK, so I gather that this film was shot entirely on a iPhone 5. That's impressive. And the producers managed to get the film distributed on DVD. That's impressive, too. But neither of these facts makes the film enjoyable. There's also a good twist here that links the beginning and the end well. In fact, it's a really good idea. But the ending is botched and the middle is annoying, at least to me.The problem here is that the premise of the film is that a man has discovered that his girlfriend is cheating on him, so he decides to make a film for her so that she can see the effect her infidelity is having on her. He and two friends go on a semi-aimless road trip that includes all sorts of bizarre events, most notably a pair of prostitutes. And throughout far too much of it, Joey simply screams. The film, according to the commentary, is supposed to explore the theme of madness, but undifferentiated shouting that goes on far too long did not convey to me madness; it just became annoying.I do appreciate the difficulty of guerrilla filmmaking. And I appreciate the cleverness of the ending. However, starting with a script would have helped. (That's not hyperbole or sarcasm. The filmmakers state in the audio commentary that they did not have a script at the start.) Unfortunately, I think a clever idea was ruined by a slapdash approach to the film.",2,Too much shouting,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,1360,"['OK', 'gather', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'entirely', 'iPhone', '5', 'impressive', 'producers', 'managed', 'get', 'film', 'distributed', 'DVD', 'impressive', 'too', 'facts', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'also', 'good', 'twist', 'here', 'beginning', 'end', 'well', 'fact', 'really', 'good', 'idea', 'ending', 'botched', 'middle', 'annoying', 'least', 'me.The', 'problem', 'here', 'premise', 'film', 'man', 'discovered', 'girlfriend', 'cheating', 'so', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'effect', 'infidelity', 'having', 'two', 'friends', 'go', 'semi-aimless', 'road', 'trip', 'sorts', 'bizarre', 'events', 'most', 'notably', 'pair', 'prostitutes', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'Joey', 'simply', 'film', 'according', 'commentary', 'supposed', 'explore', 'theme', 'madness', 'undifferentiated', 'shouting', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'did', 'not', 'convey', 'madness', 'just', 'became', 'annoying.I', 'do', 'appreciate', 'difficulty', 'guerrilla', 'filmmaking', 'appreciate', 'cleverness', 'ending', 'However', 'starting', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'not', 'hyperbole', 'sarcasm', 'filmmakers', 'state', 'audio', 'commentary', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'script', 'start', 'Unfortunately', 'think', 'clever', 'idea', 'was', 'ruined', 'slapdash', 'approach', 'film']",To Jennifer
