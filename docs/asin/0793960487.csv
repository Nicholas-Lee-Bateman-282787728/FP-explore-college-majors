It lasted 3 seasons, which is a miracle considering the wasteland of network TV! Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) was / is one of the most complex characters to ever appear in any television series.

James Wong and Glen Morgan, who took over the show with season 2, ruined what could have been a solidly realistic, creepy and entertaining program.The quality of the transfers vary.

159961,A33G2XG1S5NSH1,0793960487,"Bryant Burnette ""Bryant Burnette""","[31, 33]","Season One of ""Millennium"" has got to rank as the most grim season of any television series ever broadcast on network TV.  There is an air of misery, despair, and doom that hangs over every episode.  Other shows have gone further in terms of gore -- ""CSI"" leaps immediately to mind -- but none of them have gone as far in terms of tone.  For a lot of people, that makes this first season hard to watch, but if you're game for it, then I think it's probably Chris Carter's finest single season on any of his shows.  A dark, brooding masterpiece.Season two still bears Carter's name, but he was busy working on the ""X-Files"" movie, and consequently left Glen Morgan and James Wong in charge of ""Millennium"" this particular year.  Some fans see the second season as a too-abrupt change of pace from season one, and indeed there is a palpable difference in both content and tone.  The show is still dark, but the plot opens up to become a bit more of a standard ""X-Files""-like conspiracy show, with the Millennium Group put a bit more front and center.  To me, this seems like a natural outgrowth of the first season, so no complaints.  And about half season two's episodes are not just good, they're GREAT -- this season is HIGHLY recommended.Unfortunately, season three is a colossal disappointment.  Without giving anything away, let's say that season two ended on, well, a BIT of a cliffhanger, and one that seemed as if it was pushing the series in a very specific direction.  The beginning of season three almost totally ignores that intended direction, and if you're one of the people who feel that season two went against the grain of the first season, well, maybe that's a good thing.  For everyone else, it just feels like a huge cheat.  Again, I don't want to say too much, lest I spoil parts of the plot for newcomers; but suffice it to say that I just DO NOT accept the direction the third season took.  It definitely doesn't match with season two, but I personally don't think it matches with season one, either.  It's not a complete waste of time, as the production values remained high, Lance Henriksen remained awesome as Frank, and several individual episodes managed to be good ones.  But there are also a few that are laughably bad, and all in all, it's just not good.Still, the first two seasons are absolutely terrific, so this set as a whole is definitely recommended.",4,"two great seasons, one mediocre season = pretty good",1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,2387,"['Season', 'One', 'Millennium', 'got', 'rank', 'most', 'grim', 'season', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'broadcast', 'network', 'TV', 'air', 'misery', 'despair', 'doom', 'episode', 'Other', 'shows', 'have', 'gone', 'further', 'terms', 'gore', 'CSI', 'immediately', 'mind', 'none', 'have', 'gone', 'far', 'terms', 'tone', 'lot', 'people', 'first', 'season', 'hard', 'watch', ""'re"", 'game', 'then', 'think', 'probably', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'finest', 'single', 'season', 'shows', 'dark', 'brooding', 'masterpiece.Season', 'two', 'still', 'Carter', 'name', 'was', 'busy', 'working', 'X-Files', 'movie', 'consequently', 'left', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'James', 'Wong', 'charge', 'Millennium', 'particular', 'year', 'fans', 'see', 'second', 'season', 'too-abrupt', 'change', 'pace', 'season', 'one', 'indeed', 'palpable', 'difference', 'content', 'tone', 'show', 'still', 'dark', 'plot', 'up', 'become', 'bit', 'more', 'standard', 'X-Files', 'conspiracy', 'show', 'Millennium', 'Group', 'put', 'bit', 'more', 'front', 'center', 'natural', 'outgrowth', 'first', 'season', 'complaints', 'half', 'season', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'good', ""'re"", 'GREAT', 'season', 'HIGHLY', 'recommended.Unfortunately', 'season', 'three', 'colossal', 'disappointment', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'let', 'say', 'season', 'two', 'ended', 'well', 'BIT', 'cliffhanger', 'one', 'seemed', 'was', 'pushing', 'series', 'very', 'specific', 'direction', 'beginning', 'season', 'three', 'almost', 'totally', 'intended', 'direction', ""'re"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'season', 'two', 'went', 'grain', 'first', 'season', 'well', 'maybe', 'good', 'thing', 'everyone', 'else', 'just', 'feels', 'huge', 'cheat', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'lest', 'spoil', 'parts', 'plot', 'newcomers', 'say', 'just', 'DO', 'NOT', 'accept', 'direction', 'third', 'season', 'took', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'match', 'season', 'two', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'season', 'one', 'not', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'production', 'values', 'remained', 'high', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'remained', 'awesome', 'Frank', 'several', 'individual', 'episodes', 'managed', 'be', 'good', 'ones', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'are', 'laughably', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'good.Still', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'so', 'set', 'whole', 'definitely', 'recommended']",N/A

159963,A2WI503YTC6S2C,0793960487,con kangas,"[0, 0]","The Millenium Series is still one of my favorite TV series of all time. I especially loved the way the supernatural was introduced into what initially appeared to be an especially dark drama serieson serial killers with an anti-hero as its key protagonist. It is a dark series, perhaps that darkest series of all time, and that is what led to its downfall.  The music is also a highpoint. The very first episode Kingdom Come begins with Nine Inch Nails. Fans forget how good Millenium was, especially the excellent use of songs that only The Sopranos exceeded.Millenium like the X-Files worked on the conspiracy theory but the twist was, one of the conspirators was personified evil, a demon, if not Satan himself, up against Frank Black. Add to this the ambivalent Peter Watts who is the link to the mysterious Millenium Group. The Millenium Group was not too dissimilar from the group that the Smoking Man represented in the X-Files.Supernatural theme -  I enjoyed the  supernatural Millenium episodes the most. To this day I believe that the 18th episode in Series 1 - Lamentation - is still the most frightening and darkest TV you will ever see. The episode immediately after Lamentation called  -  Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions  - really raised the bar. These two episodes introduce the viewer to the now iconic - Lucy Butler.  ALL episodes including Lucy Butler were brilliant but especially, Room Without a View and Antipas. The supernatural enters the Millenium series midway through Series 1 and all though the second series.  Series 2 is excellent mainly due to the stenghth of the writers James Wong & Glen Morgan.The Third series removes the supernatural and apart from a few quick glimpses in two episodes, this series settles on standard series killer episodes very similar to Criminal Minds. Apart from the Lucy Butler episode, Antipas, the episodes in the Third Series are highly  predictable. Chris Carter alleges that he sacked the Series Two writers - James Wong &  Glen Morgan - and wrote most of the Third Series and ""put Millenium back on track"". The Third Series suffered from exceedingly poor ratings. Millenium does suffer from ""filler episodes."" If you removed the filler episodes from Series 1 and 3, you would without a doubt one of THE best series of all time.The Millenium Legacy - The CSI shows, Supernatural, some Dexter episodes but mostly Criminal Minds, heavily borrow from Millenium.  Criminal Minds at times appears to blatantly copy Millenium.The time is in fact NOT only near ....but time to re-launch Millenium.5 Stars for Millenium.

I give this tape only four stars because  although the series got off to an excellent start it didn't really hit its  stride until the last third of the first season, when elements of the  supernatural started creeping (and creep is definitely the operative word  here) into it, and Millennium slowly transformed into the absolute best  horror/fantasy/sf series ever. Although it was always just as much a drama,  too. Forget TV, I can't even think of very many films in the genre that can  touch this program for subtlty and smarts.  For instance, in the brilliant  episode &quot;Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions,&quot; it  becomes fairly apparent that one character is an angel and another is a man  posessed by a demon, but nothing is ever explicitly indicated.  Now, in  pretty much any other show or film they'd hit you over the head with it.  They'd probably have the demon-guy's eyes glow red when no one's looking or  just have him outright state something that makes his identity  unmistakable. They'd probably have the angel-guy sprout wings at some  point.  But Millennium was almost unique in the extent to which it always  demonstrated unusual faith in the intelligence of its audience.

159969,A391UWNYC7K7JS,0793960487,"Gary Gardner ""Your resident dillettante""","[7, 7]","&quot;Millennium&quot; was indeed a rare bird for American television: It was fresh, inventive, intelligent, frightening, eccentric, and uncompromising. For these reasons, it was cancelled. Too bad. Television may never be this strong again. Lance Henriksen starred as Frank Black, an ex-FBI agent who gets seriously burned out tracking insane killers; he retires when things start affecting his family, and he returns home to Seattle. His life takes an unexpected turn when another ex-FBI agent named Peter Watts (played by the excellent Terry O'Quinn) vies to recruit Black into the ranks of the enigmatic Millennium Group, a cabal intent on controlling (or stopping, we're never really sure which) the End Times. The reason? Black has the ability to &quot;see&quot;, in his mind's eye, the intent and bizarre reasoning of the killer's actions; therefore, Frank's powers are attractive to Watts and the Group. In the first part, &quot;Pilot,&quot; Frank helps the Seattle P.D. and the Group try to apprehend the Frenchman, a serial killer who feasts on strippers and assorted city drifters, and leaves clues in French. &quot;Gehenna&quot;, the second part of the tape, pits Frank against one of the &quot;Millennium&quot; fandom's favorite arch-rivals, the sinister Gehenna devil, an evil incarnate force that Black will meet several times throughout the length of the show's life. I regret the shameful way Fox and Chris Carter treated this series, as if it were an also-ran to &quot;The X-Files&quot;. The fact is, this series was in many ways superior to its more popular counterpart in the Carter sphere. The show was a bit hard to swallow and undoubtedly heavy-handed. But it was always thought-provoking and never, ever dull. The lame way Frank Black's quest was ended on an &quot;X-Files&quot; episode last season did little to dispel the evil that was so present in his world. I refuse to believe that the Millennium Group just disappeared into the mists of time after surviving many millennia of the themselves. I think a movie or two to clear up these loose ends is in order.

159973,A1J2LQPDI4NKRG,0793960487,Kirk McElhearn,"[13, 17]","I have spent the past month or so watching all three seasons of Millenium, attracted originally by the fact that it was created and produced by Chris Carter, the man behind X Files. Unfortunately, this series fails in several ways, from a lack of direction, and an abandonment by its creator.In the three seasons of Millenium, there are three totally different tones. In the interviews at the end of each season, it's obvious why. Chris Carter wanted to create a ""murder mystery"" show, a pretty standard type of series, unlike X Files. So the first season is just that: each episode is a murder mystery, almost all involving serial killers, and most with a lot of blood. But Carter didn't have time to do more than just oversee the beginnings of this series, and, as often happens with TV series today, handed it off to others to continue. The first season is actually the weakest, being quite predictable, with some spookiness added to the serial killings to make it a bit different. Too much time was spent with Frank Black's wife and daughter. While the second season took these characters and integrated them better into the series, most of their presence in the first season seemed like they were there simply as a counterpoint to the violence.The second season was produced and managed by Glen Morgan and James Wong, who turned it into a much more interesting series, with an over-arching story line of conspiracy among the Millenium Group, who, in the first season, were simply a group of ex-FBI agents who consulted for law enforcement. Under Morgan and Wong, this group had its own plans that went far beyond simply solving mysteries. There were some brilliant episodes in this season, and an amazing 9 1/2 minute sequence in the final episode set to Patti Smith's ""Land"", a powerful song.In the third season, Carter took back control, and grudgingly continued in the same direction as the second season. While not quite as fulfilling, this final season did have more of a narrative than the first season. Moving Frank Black to Washington DC, and adding a new character (Emma Hollis), as his partner, the tone was different. There were more ""murder mysteries"", though the conspiracy thread continued. In the end, though, Carter's vision was at conflict with what the second season had developed, making things a bit of a muddle at times. The show was cancelled at the end of the third season, leaving many things up in the air. (Though an episode of the 7th season of X Files tries to tie up some of the loose ends.)This series could have been good if Morgan and Wong ran it for its entirety. Carter tried to make a banal mystery series with lots of blood, but Morgan and Wong gave it substance. There are some excellent episodes in the last two seasons (less so in the first), but there are also a lot of lemons. While the acting is good, and the direction similar to that of X Files, the show just didn't have the kind of direction it needed.I was driven to watch the entire three seasons, but only after I started watching the second season. At the end of the first, I wasn't sure I wanted to keep watching, because its episodes were so similar. Worth watching if you have nothing else to do, but I can't help think that I wasted a lot of my time.",3,Mediocre series that could have been much better,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,3259,"['have', 'spent', 'past', 'month', 'so', 'watching', 'three', 'seasons', 'Millenium', 'attracted', 'originally', 'fact', 'was', 'created', 'produced', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'man', 'X', 'Files', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'several', 'ways', 'lack', 'direction', 'abandonment', 'creator.In', 'three', 'seasons', 'Millenium', 'are', 'three', 'totally', 'different', 'tones', 'interviews', 'end', 'season', 'obvious', 'why', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'wanted', 'create', 'murder', 'mystery', 'show', 'pretty', 'standard', 'type', 'series', 'X', 'Files', 'first', 'season', 'just', 'episode', 'murder', 'mystery', 'almost', 'involving', 'serial', 'killers', 'most', 'lot', 'blood', 'Carter', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'oversee', 'beginnings', 'series', 'as', 'often', 'TV', 'series', 'today', 'handed', 'off', 'others', 'continue', 'first', 'season', 'actually', 'weakest', 'being', 'quite', 'predictable', 'spookiness', 'added', 'serial', 'killings', 'make', 'bit', 'different', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'Frank', 'Black', 'wife', 'daughter', 'second', 'season', 'took', 'characters', 'integrated', 'better', 'series', 'most', 'presence', 'first', 'season', 'seemed', 'were', 'there', 'simply', 'counterpoint', 'violence.The', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'produced', 'managed', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'James', 'Wong', 'who', 'turned', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'series', 'over-arching', 'story', 'line', 'conspiracy', 'Millenium', 'Group', 'who', 'first', 'season', 'were', 'simply', 'group', 'ex-FBI', 'agents', 'who', 'consulted', 'law', 'enforcement', 'Morgan', 'Wong', 'group', 'had', 'own', 'plans', 'went', 'far', 'simply', 'solving', 'mysteries', 'were', 'brilliant', 'episodes', 'season', 'amazing', '9', '1/2', 'minute', 'sequence', 'final', 'episode', 'set', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'Land', 'powerful', 'song.In', 'third', 'season', 'Carter', 'took', 'back', 'control', 'grudgingly', 'continued', 'same', 'direction', 'second', 'season', 'not', 'quite', 'fulfilling', 'final', 'season', 'did', 'have', 'more', 'narrative', 'first', 'season', 'Moving', 'Frank', 'Black', 'Washington', 'DC', 'adding', 'new', 'character', 'Emma', 'Hollis', 'partner', 'tone', 'was', 'different', 'were', 'more', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'conspiracy', 'thread', 'continued', 'end', 'Carter', 'vision', 'was', 'conflict', 'what', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'developed', 'making', 'things', 'bit', 'muddle', 'times', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'end', 'third', 'season', 'leaving', 'many', 'things', 'up', 'air', 'episode', '7th', 'season', 'X', 'Files', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'Morgan', 'Wong', 'ran', 'entirety', 'Carter', 'tried', 'make', 'banal', 'mystery', 'series', 'lots', 'blood', 'Morgan', 'Wong', 'gave', 'substance', 'are', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'less', 'so', 'first', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'lemons', 'acting', 'good', 'direction', 'similar', 'X', 'Files', 'show', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'direction', 'was', 'driven', 'watch', 'entire', 'three', 'seasons', 'only', 'started', 'watching', 'second', 'season', 'end', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'wanted', 'keep', 'watching', 'episodes', 'were', 'so', 'similar', 'Worth', 'watching', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'wasted', 'lot', 'time']",N/A

159975,A19B0WUZCH8I4R,0793960487,Lionheart,"[0, 0]","Millennium, when it first appeared, cut through the frequent comic stylings of the X-Files to present a harsher vision of the world, or at least one that was more cynical, or it took the best ideas from the X-Files and did not flinch away from them this time on the basis that people might find them ""unpalatable."" This is dark, dreary stuff, with almost no comic or romantic undertones. It also foreshadows a ton of similar ""profiler-based"" television shows, from ""Bones"" to the various CSI incarnations.That it ultimately did not succeed does not negate its overall importance -- the failure speaks more to the shame of the FOX network than anything else. Or it was just a sign of the times (a Millennium probably could not succeed for long in the era in which it was born, no matter how well done).It was like nothing on tv, but now fans of shows like Dexter will recognize similarities. Intelligence where there was otherwise stupidity, or sitcoms. Or AFHV.It was also one of the first real mature-audience oriented television shows to appear on network television, so there is that.Frank Black is the protagonist, a former FBI profiler who has been engaged by the ""Millennium Group"" to do consulting work on certain criminal cases, specifically, serial homicides. But really, he's just a man trying to piece his life back together again after a nervous breakdown. He has a wife and a miracle child, and is just trying to keep them safe. He wants the house, the fence, the two-car garage. Unfortunately for him, vast events are unfolding, the ""end times"" are quickly approaching, and the ""Group"" is a kind of cult consisting of former FBI agents who believe that the apocalypse is something that must be controlled by them in order to ensure mankind's ultimate moral survival: and they need him. More specifically, they need access to the mysterious visions granted him, which allow him to ""see what the killer sees."" Frank can become the killer, it seems: he does not identify or profile anymore. He occupies. Which was what led to his breakdown in the first place.The first season is the weakest of the three. Frank hunts a serial-killer-of-the-week while trying to maintain a healthy home life. The plots are smart and often intriguing, but there is something repulsive about getting excited about following a maniac's obscure crime scene clues. Dead is dead, and though we appreciate the gritty theater, and Hendrickson's great performance, something is decidedly missing. Also, he needs to be a romantic lead to his wife, this Frank Black guy, and he just can't do it. We don't buy it for a second. Who would ever be attracted to this guy, except a platonic friend? The Millennium Group angle, when it crops up, is fun because it is smart and evolves over episodes, like the X-Files ""mythology"" thing. But it's rarely there. The best episode is the last, but is needlessly confusing: Frank has a stalker who may or may not be demonic, but he relies these days on one of Frank's serial-killers-of-the-week to get his fun from Frank. It is not a direct attack until his murderous buddy is caught. Convoluted nonsense put down on paper with no other objective than to deceive the viewer.The second season is better, adding new characters, shedding the ""killer of the week"" scenario, and more directly involving Frank and his family in the Millennium Group's activities. Smarter, deeper mysteries involving history and religion, and casting doubt on Frank's allies: are they the good or bad guys? Just what is he getting for what he is sacrificing? The ""family man"" angle has been abandoned. Frank is no longer the romantic lead, but a pivotal player is some kind of monstrous play being enacted over the ages leading to a final ""end day."" Late in the second season, it appears Chris Carter and folks (the guys and gals behind this show, who also created and developed the X-Files) got word that there might not be a third, so they decided to advance the subplots and go all out for the finale: the result of which is an absolutely breathtaking episode. Smart, thrilling, blow-your-mind kind of stuff. Could've been a movie, it's that good. Worth the price of the DVD set in itself.The third season is unjustly underrated. Still intelligent, still dark and gritty, but it's got a couple problems: Frank's wife is dead, who was one of the pivots of the series. He doesn't flow well without her, seems like just another wayward loser, to be ""Frank"" about the situation. The second problem is that the season finale in season two was an end-of-the-world scenario, but now the writers have to continue on. Their solution, that only about eighty people died in the Pacific Northwest (including Frank's wife) does not jibe with the plot of the finale. The writers want to take it back, leave the world intact, because hey, lookie here, we got renewed after all. It doesn't work.Nonetheless, I enjoyed it nearly as much as the second. There's a lot more about the Millennium group, deeper mysteries, more suprises. Frank's new ""partner"" is an interesting character, and his often antagonistic relationship with the FBI is fun to watch. Then there's the Jordan subplots, which grow more entertaining and complex the older she gets. The finale is surprisingly entertaining, resolving many issues from past episodes. But it does suffer from the absence of Frank's wife.Why does this show ultimately fail? 1. What are these visions of Frank's? They usually provide nothing for the viewer to latch onto. A few dramatic shots of slashings and hackings, little else. It's like whoever wrote the episodes did not even do them, but they were put in later by the producers because that was just what Frank does. Eliminate them all, and the episodes (mostly) could've been told just as well. 2. We buy Frank as a family man, but not as a lover. We never believe any of his romantic scenes with his wife. The one sexual scene he has with her is just painful to look at. Fast forward. 3. The initial killer-of-the-week thing, combined with its airing on the same night as the X-Files, meant many people saw it as Chris Carter's adulterated version of that show. They were not willing to consider it beyond that attitude. 4. They tried to back away from the season 2 finale, which was definitive. Frank, remaddened by the death of his wife in a post-apocalyptic world, was remade into Frank the single father rejoining the FBI to investigate the Millennium group in a world redrawn as it was before the season 2 plague, which is now referred to as merely an ""outbreak."" The season 3 writers did not have enough courage to continue what they had begun the previous year. 5. Lance is too one-dimensional to support the whole world himself -- that's why he needed the beautiful wife, or at least the intriguing new partner. And his season 3 partner, although good, is not good enough. She can't pick up the slack. A romantic entanglement could have saved the series, but Lance wasn't capable, in my opinion.",4,"A smarter, dingier X-Files",1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,6988,"['Millennium', 'when', 'first',

159977,A38K01P0FW7ZL4,0793960487,Ming Ciao,"[3, 3]","How do I describe this show? It's easily the most depressing episodic drama I've ever seen. Gone are the picturesque faces of Gillian Anderson, and David Duchovny. So get used to Lance Henrikson's cavernous wrinkles. And my God, is this show depressing. At times, in the ""comically self-serious"" vein. To be fair, it warns its viewers with the theme song setting the morose tone with the violin, sunset, and sad lady, and...my God this show is depressing. Ergo, English majors will totally love this.Millennium is also incredibly engaging, with moments of brilliance. You're better off to part with Season 3. Don't worry. You're not missing anything. Unless you want to see Lance Henriksen rocking silver hair.If I had to summarize this series....Season 1 conveys Mr. Sad (Frank Black) walking around, solving murders. Intense murders with flashes of ""Seven"" (according to Wikipedia this was Carter's pitch to FOX. ""Seven in Seattle"".)Season 2 has Mr. Sad solving murders with a hot chick who chain smokes. Occasionally dipping into comedy, and vague sensationalistic spiritualism. Also much denser in plot with the Millennium group.Like anybody really cares, but Chris Carter (show creator) oversaw Season 1 (for better, or worse.) Afterwards, Morgan, and Wong (the dudes who wrote the first ""Final Destination"") took over as show runners for Season 2, and took the taut, focused narrative of Season 1, and basically drugged the series with mushrooms, and force fed it rainbow sprinkles to give it a blood sugar/mushroom high. Resulting in a variegated season with bizarre comedic numbers, and ill-defined spiritual tangents. But someone wasn't feelin' it.Which is why....Season 3 is Carter being a knob, and undoing the ambitious work of Morgan/Wong.",4,The X-Files Sans Prozac,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,1752,"['How', 'do', 'describe', 'show', 'easily', 'most', 'depressing', 'episodic', 'drama', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Gone', 'are', 'picturesque', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'So', 'get', 'used', 'Lance', 'Henrikson', 'cavernous', 'wrinkles', 'God', 'show', 'depressing', 'times', 'comically', 'self-serious', 'vein', 'be', 'fair', 'viewers', 'theme', 'song', 'setting', 'morose', 'tone', 'violin', 'sunset', 'sad', 'lady', 'God', 'show', 'depressing', 'Ergo', 'English', 'majors', 'will', 'totally', 'love', 'this.Millennium', 'also', 'incredibly', 'engaging', 'moments', 'brilliance', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'part', 'Season', '3', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'re"", 'not', 'missing', 'anything', 'want', 'see', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'rocking', 'silver', 'hair.If', 'had', 'summarize', 'series', '1', 'conveys', 'Mr', 'Sad', 'Frank', 'Black', 'walking', 'around', 'solving', 'murders', 'Intense', 'murders', 'flashes', 'Seven', 'according', 'Wikipedia', 'was', 'Carter', 'pitch', 'FOX', 'Seven', 'Seattle', 'Season', '2', 'Mr', 'Sad', 'solving', 'murders', 'hot', 'chick', 'who', 'chain', 'smokes', 'Occasionally', 'dipping', 'comedy', 'vague', 'sensationalistic', 'spiritualism', 'Also', 'much', 'denser', 'plot', 'Millennium', 'group.Like', 'anybody', 'really', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'show', 'creator', 'oversaw', 'Season', '1', 'better', 'worse', 'Afterwards', 'Morgan', 'Wong', 'dudes', 'who', 'wrote', 'first', 'Final', 'Destination', 'took', 'over', 'show', 'runners', 'Season', '2', 'took', 'taut', 'focused', 'narrative', 'Season', '1', 'basically', 'drugged', 'series', 'mushrooms', 'force', 'fed', 'sprinkles', 'give', 'blood', 'sugar/mushroom', 'high', 'Resulting', 'variegated', 'season', 'bizarre', 'comedic', 'numbers', 'ill-defined', 'spiritual', 'tangents', 'someone', 'was', ""n't"", 'feelin', 'it.Which', 'why', '.Season', '3', 'Carter', 'being', 'knob', 'undoing', 'ambitious', 'work', 'Morgan/Wong']",N/A

I still remember watching this show back when it first aired in 1996 after The X-Files. I was 12 at the time and I recall this show being 1,000 times scarier than that other Chris Carter show. Both are great by the way, but as I watched Millennium from the first to last episode again, I realized there is just something so intoxicating about it. Take a beautifully creepy opening theme song and visual montage, add a mesmerizing performance from Lance Henriksen and some really scary storylines that are above average or great 90% of the time, then you get a show as special as this. Millennium had more gore and carnage than any program that came before it. CSI owes a lot to this one.Seasons 1 and 2 are both outstanding, but the quality does drop off quite a bit for the 3rd. I hated the partner he had and some of the episodes really stunk.Lance Henriksen will forever be Bishop (from Aliens of course) and Frank Black to me. He gives it his all each and every episode and made a character that is both dark and complex. It's also worth mentioning that John Locke was a mysterious guy long before he got to the LOST island.

It had the fear of the time down to a science, complete with the horrors that were goign to take us all out. These were far worse than Y2K or any virus like that and, depending on the season, it seemed far worse or far, far worse. The one thing that made it for me was Frank Black and the way he felt about the world and Chris Carter and the way he wanted this world to feel. it made a mixture that was quite the beast.When you look at each season, you can tell what is swaying each of them. you have the first and the way that it was something seperate from the notions that powered the X-files. There were dark strings and murder here, but there was also a thread of the Millenium Group and what they might bring. When the second portion of this ride kicks off, you go from this feeling to a new feeling of what the show is becoming. It becomes an X-files like show in some respects, and the paranoid approach and the hidden things sleep everywhere. The group cannot be trusted, who can, and the world seems like it is shrouded in a deep bank of crypticness. The third season turns and goes back a bit, allowing some things to return while stifling other things. It is a strange journey and an interesting one and it is powerful if you enjoy ideas like this.Another thing to add is that, in X-files, the group appears sometimes. One of the last seasons has a wrap-up segment of sorts and i mention this because it sort of gave me a place to stand and pause. I could recall Frank when he was a scared man and then here, once more, human and hurting. It was solid and it reminded me and, well, i cannot say I haven't been impacted by stuff like this.Far from it.To get all three seasons is a feat, and a grand one. you see all the extras and you can get all the show. It has little tendrils that you might not get in some little loose ends, but loving something that much won't make it hard. Besides, there is always Video on Demand if you just want one of two pieces after the fact.I think this is a 5/5, easily, and hope rewatching it brings back that Chris Carter feeling. Now, in 2011, I miss all of that a lot.
