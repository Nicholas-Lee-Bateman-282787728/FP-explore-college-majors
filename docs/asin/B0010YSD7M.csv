1127940,A1RXOY2VOGNEU5,B0010YSD7M,"Alan H. Treiber ""Doc In CT""","[4, 9]","The ""Ark of Truth"" is basically what should have/would have been 3 or even 4 episode had the series continued on television.But it's not.  It's a rather hurried 100 minutes of a mixed story line retreading the same themes: replicators endangering the ship and crew, the ""evil"" manipulations of the IOA, the uncompleted Ori story line, the small band of humans overcoming impossible odds to save the galaxy and mankind etc.Frankly it leaves lot's of plot questions unanswered by its conclusion, just too many gaps in the story along with inconsistencies with the ""Stargate history"".  It does have some of the back story explaining the issues between the Ori and the Ancients and the creation of the Ark.Robert Cooper wrote, directed and produced this direct to DVD video. I find doing all three things generally doesn't lead to better movies or videos.  Besides the weak story and plot line, the dialog is rather flat compared to numerous other SG-1 episodes.  Based on reviews I've seen, SG-1 fans will likely enjoy the DVD movie, but it is not the best effort of the series.Image quality is good and looks nice upscaled by a Toshiba HD-A20 on a 62inch screen.  The accompanying sound track is ok.PSHave not yet watched the story behind extra (the DVD is really light in extras).  The prelude is a quick set of snippet from the entire Ori story arc, but is just that snippets (or visual sound bites).  It does nothing to advance the story.PPSJust for the blog ninja - I am a long time fan of the series ever since it made it debut (even have all episodes on DVD plus the original movie).  The series has had it's ups and downs, this movie is a bit of the latter.",3,A triple play that is a bit tired and lame,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,1662,"['Ark', 'Truth', 'basically', 'what', 'should', 'have/would', 'have', 'been', '3', 'even', '4', 'episode', 'had', 'series', 'continued', 'not', 'rather', 'hurried', '100', 'minutes', 'mixed', 'story', 'line', 'retreading', 'same', 'themes', 'replicators', 'endangering', 'ship', 'crew', 'evil', 'manipulations', 'IOA', 'uncompleted', 'Ori', 'story', 'line', 'small', 'band', 'humans', 'overcoming', 'impossible', 'odds', 'save', 'galaxy', 'mankind', 'etc.Frankly', 'lot', 'plot', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'conclusion', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'gaps', 'story', 'inconsistencies', 'Stargate', 'history', 'have', 'back', 'story', 'explaining', 'issues', 'Ori', 'Ancients', 'creation', 'Ark.Robert', 'Cooper', 'wrote', 'directed', 'produced', 'direct', 'DVD', 'video', 'find', 'doing', 'three', 'things', 'generally', ""n't"", 'lead', 'better', 'movies', 'videos', 'weak', 'story', 'plot', 'line', 'dialog', 'rather', 'flat', 'compared', 'numerous', 'other', 'SG-1', 'episodes', 'Based', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'SG-1', 'fans', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'movie', 'not', 'best', 'effort', 'series.Image', 'quality', 'good', 'nice', 'upscaled', 'Toshiba', 'HD-A20', '62inch', 'screen', 'accompanying', 'sound', 'track', 'ok.PSHave', 'not', 'yet', 'watched', 'story', 'extra', 'DVD', 'really', 'light', 'extras', 'prelude', 'quick', 'set', 'snippet', 'entire', 'Ori', 'story', 'arc', 'just', 'snippets', 'visual', 'sound', 'bites', 'nothing', 'advance', 'story.PPSJust', 'blog', 'ninja', 'am', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'series', 'ever', 'made', 'debut', 'even', 'have', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'original', 'movie', 'series', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'movie', 'bit', 'latter']",Stargate - The Ark of Truth

1127944,AMIGVTZZIWS6I,B0010YSD7M,Amazon Customer,"[4, 6]","All I can say is, ""Wow!""  This film was a lot of fun and while the ending was just a little contrived it did what was intended: tied up the Ori storyline so the team can move on to other adventures.  First, let me say that I'm not one of those people who thinks the Sci Fi Channel was doing the bidding of Satan by cancelling Stargate SG-1.  It was time, in my opinion, for the long-running series to leave the air.  The Ori storyline, which I never liked, was dragging on forever and it seemed the writers of the series were just rehashing old sci-fi plot devices to fill out a full season.  Second, this film goes a long way to redeeming the Stargate franchise and reminding us just how great Stargate was in its heyday.  The only missing link in this film was an appearance by Richard Dean Anderson's Jack O'Neill.One of the major positives about this movie is that each character gets his or her moments to shine.  Tel'c especially has a wonderful scene with Tomin in which they discuss the terrible things they've done and about the idea of forgiveness.  Probably was one of finest moments for Christopher Judge in years.  Another stand-out is the character of Cam Mitchell.  In his two years on the series I never really warmed to this character, which always surprised me since I'm such a huge fan of Ben Browder's performance in Farscape.  In this movie, I think the character really comes into his own as an individual and a leader.  Of course, Sam and Daniel have their great moments, and the saving grace of Stargate's final two seasons, Vala, is as funny and dramatic as ever. Claudia Black is truly an underused actress. Her scenes with Tomin (played wonderfully by Tim Guinee) are some of the best in the movie.It goes without saying the special effects were as good or better than the series, which were already fantastic for something made on low-budget cable money.  It's also worth mentioning the music was great and reminded me a lot of the music in the original Stargate movie.This is not the best film for new viewers of Stargate, but a nice prelude that catches you up is included on the DVD, so new viewers shouldn't stay away. What this film does is tie up the loose ends from season 10 of Stargate SG-1 and allow for the beginning of some new adventures.

I greatly appreciate that the Ori storyline was wrapped up in this movie, since there were a lot of dangling threads at the end of season 10.Among the things I enjoyed:- all of the actors did a great job, as usual, and there was excellent continuity with the series mythology (case in point, the Asgard core that was obtained in the final aired episode)- excellent production values, especially entering the Supergate and Adria's flaming powers (though the series always did a great job of making every dollar count in special effects)- the very best lines given to Christopher Judge in 10 years as Teal'c and Tomin discussed guilt and redemption- the moving scene where Daniel breaks down, at the limit of his faith and enduranceThings I did not enjoy so much:- the one-dimensional IOA bad guy- some very big scene jumps that had me confused for a while (ie, after entering the Supergate, suddenly Vala, Daniel and Tomin are undercover on an Ori world meeting with the underground)- bringing the replicators back was repetitive, and isolated Carter and Mitchell from the Ori saga- the replicator-zombie was just gross, and not particulary originalAfter listening to the writer/producer/director's commentary, I wish he had spent less attention on production values and more on increasing the emotional resonance of the story.  The fact is, most fans have followed SG-1 so loyally because they love the characters, and would like to see their reactions and interactions with each other.  This story felt detached somehow -- I have felt much more invested in the characters in some of the season finales than in this movie, and the season finales were never short of action, so I was suprised that the writing didn't seem up to the same standard.  Without that emotional connection, the battle and even the victory seemed a bit hollow to me.That said, it was wonderful to revisit with my favourite TV show again, and I hope they make more DVD movies!",4,"Excellent production values, story a bit hollow",1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,2015,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'own', '10', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'Ori', 'storyline', 'was', 'wrapped', 'up', 'movie', 'were', 'lot', 'dangling', 'threads', 'end', 'season', '10.Among', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'usual', 'there', 'was', 'excellent', 'continuity', 'series', 'mythology', 'case', 'point', 'Asgard', 'core', 'was', 'obtained', 'final', 'aired', 'episode', 'excellent', 'production', 'values', 'especially', 'entering', 'Supergate', 'Adria', 'flaming', 'powers', 'series', 'always', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'dollar', 'count', 'special', 'effects', 'very', 'best', 'lines', 'given', 'Christopher', 'Judge', '10', 'years', 'Teal', 'c', 'Tomin', 'discussed', 'guilt', 'redemption-', 'moving', 'scene', 'where', 'Daniel', 'down', 'limit', 'faith', 'enduranceThings', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'so', 'much', 'one-dimensional', 'IOA', 'bad', 'guy-', 'very', 'big', 'scene', 'jumps', 'had', 'confused', 'while', 'ie', 'entering', 'Supergate', 'suddenly', 'Vala', 'Daniel', 'Tomin', 'are', 'undercover', 'Ori', 'world', 'meeting', 'underground', 'bringing', 'replicators', 'back', 'was', 'repetitive', 'isolated', 'Carter', 'Mitchell', 'Ori', 'saga-', 'replicator-zombie', 'was', 'just', 'gross', 'not', 'particulary', 'originalAfter', 'listening', 'writer/producer/director', 'commentary', 'wish', 'had', 'spent', 'less', 'attention', 'production', 'values', 'more', 'increasing', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'story', 'fact', 'most', 'fans', 'have', 'followed', 'SG-1', 'so', 'loyally', 'love', 'characters', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'reactions', 'interactions', 'other', 'story', 'felt', 'detached', 'somehow', 'have', 'felt', 'much', 'more', 'invested', 'characters', 'season', 'finales', 'movie', 'season', 'finales', 'were', 'never', 'short', 'action', 'was', 'suprised', 'writing', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'up', 'same', 'standard', 'emotional', 'connection', 'battle', 'even', 'victory', 'seemed', 'bit', 'hollow', 'said', 'was', 'wonderful', 'revisit', 'favourite', 'TV', 'show', 'again', 'hope', 'make', 'more', 'DVD', 'movies']",Stargate - The Ark of Truth

It concludes the Ori battle and yet ends with SG-1 starting another mission. Something SG-1 has not had time to do for a couple years. Let's face it most of us have missed Jack and the exploring they use to do. The bulk of the movie is finding a weapon to destroy the Ori, but it turns out it is not where they first thought and when they find it, it doesn't do what they originally thought either. However they are victorious and there are changes of loyalty from a place you might not expect. Overall I was not at all disappointed, but I must admit the scene with Teal'c walking across a desert after being shot by a Ori weapon was a bit much.The wife and I were a bit disappointed that Richard Dean Anderson didn't even put in a cameo appearance. Excellent production values as always, they won't seem better as the TV series was so good that we were all spoiled by them. The DVD includes plenty of extras including a prelude you can play previous to watching the movie. The prelude is snapshot segments from several episodes from the last two seasons and that lead up to the final battle. I bought a copy because I loved the series and it wouldn't be complete without this movie. They made it clear another movie is in the works.

1127962,A282A0P69UT137,B0010YSD7M,"Captain Hornblower ""captainhornblower""","[48, 82]","As a fan who has watched the show from the beginning and has loved it all along, I must say that this film was overall a disappointment.But let me start with some positives.  The production values of the film were awesome, and I loved the location filming in the mountains.  The photography in this was quite beautifully done.  And the actors did magnificent as always.  I also liked the elements of the story involving Tomin and his facing the actions he took as an Ori soldier, with Teal'c being the one most interested in and capable of helping him through it.  This also gave Christopher Judge a chance to really show his dramatic acting capabilities, when most of the time his role is based more on physicality.But beyond that, I thought that the film had three major flaws that detracted from the quality and enjoyability of the film.  One-the whole plot device of the Ark of Truth was an overly simplistic solution to the Ori problem.  Open a box, let a Prior see it, and all the Ori followers will see the error of their ways and be nice from now on.  Come on!!  I know that they had to come up with some kind of simplified solution to the Ori problem because they didn't have a whole season to wrap the story, but this was a just plain stupid idea!Two-bringing back the replicators!!  As soon as I saw that metallic bug, I hung my head and went ""Argh, give me a (bleeping) break!""  The replicators were a lot of fun for a villain back when they were first introduced, but at this point, they have just gotten old!  I'm sick of them!  They've almost become an excuse for them to bring out big guns with really big ammo magazines so they can show a plethera of clips of really loud guns being fired by really cool looking dudes!  They could've thrown in Jean Claude Van Damm and made this a B action film.  I think if they had focused on the Ori story instead of devoting a full third of the film to the replicators, the film might have been much better served!  Instead, I felt like I had seen all of the replicator stuff before.  Of course, I had, in Seasons 4, 5, 6, 7, and a whole lot in Season 8!Third-the replicator element brings us to the final problem I had with this film-Replicator Man!  At least, that's what I like to call the replicator-controlled zombie that Colonel Mitchell fights.  Through this whole sequence, I thought I was watching some cheesy zombie film mixed in with a little action-movie style fight scenes.  Replicator Man was a stupid enough plot device on its own, but then the sequence dragged on and on and on.  Only Ben Browder's whit in between the punches kept me even partially interested.As I said, disappointing film overall that had some good points, but was rather poorly executed in terms of writing and plot.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","The ending of the ""Stargate SG-1"" TV show left some threads dangling -- for one thing, the Ori were still threatening the world with conversion or death.Fortunately that particular thread is decisively tied up in the direct-to-DVD movie that followed: ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" While it doesn't quite have the unique flavour of the TV series -- and the Ark seems like a rather pat quickie solution -- the movie does bring back all the favorite characters in a satisfactory ending.""The Ark of Truth"" is an Ancient device that brainwashes people -- and SG-1 is searching for it, where they run into Vala's ex-hubby Tomin (who ends up teaming up with them). But soon they have a lead on where the Ark might be, and head for Celestis in the hopes of finding a bloodless method of stopping the Ori once and for all.Unfortunately they have a slew of new problems -- Ori motherships are approaching Earth with the intent to convert or destroy, a nasty IOA rep has created and loosed a very familiar enemy on the Odyssey, and Vala's malevolent daughter Adria has gained godlike power. Fortunately SG-1 has a powerful ally of their own.Since ""The Ark of Truth"" is basically intended to wrap up loose ends, and as such they're not quite as satisfying as the television show was. Unfortunately it sometimes feels rather rushed and has a somewhat out-of-the-blue solution (hello magic fix-all!), as well as a subplot involving ANOTHER superpowerful villain race that seems likely but a bit misplaced.But as half of the series finales, it's a solid piece of work -- lots of action, space battles, mysterious artifacts, and a way bigger budget that a TV episode would ever have allowed. Fortunately that budget doesn't mean it jettisons the intriguing twists (Adria has an unexpected new position) or the moral dilemmas raised by the Ark (and the question of fighting evil faux gods vs. their followers).It also has excellent scripting: plot threads drawn from the TV series, ""Star Trek"" homages, witty dialogue (""Well, you don't expect me to remember."" ""With the fate of two galaxies hanging in the balance, yes, I expect you to remember the essential clue!""), and some nice quiet moments, such as Teal'c talking with Tomin about their bloodstained pasts.And seeing the actors as their SG-1 characters is like putting on a comfortable old shoe. Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks are suitably brilliant and courageous, and Ben Browder does a good strong, slightly quirky soldier. Christopher Judge gets to shine in  as a powerful, wise warrior, and Black gets to be both funny (""I have broken every nail"") and emotional.While it's a bit rushed and contrived, ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" is a solid enough finale to the Ori storyline.

Loved the show.Although ""The Ark of Truth"" was released in March 2008, I held off watching it until October 2009, primarily to savor what few unviewed SG-1 adventures were left to me.  It was a thrill being back with the SG-1 team as it engaged the Ori one last time.The movie plays like a long episode of ""Stargate SG-1,"" with improved special effects and somewhat of a double storyline (i.e. two threats to SG-1, earth, the galaxy, et cetera).  The usual SG-1 team banter is present along with its typical locations of operation: Cheyenne Mountain, forests and space as well as various planets and Ori strongholds.Villain #1 is obviously the Ori and its minions.  When Villain #2 appears, we get somewhat of a regurgitated storyline from a later SG-1 season.  It didn't particularly bother me, but I thought I'd point it out.  I won't reveal Villain #2's identity, but let you discover it for yourself.Another issue is that SG-1 is--once again--reliant on acquiring and implementing Ancient technology (the Ark of Truth) in order to defeat the Ori.  This lends yet another god-from-the-machine-like aspect to the tale, where SG-1 must merely hustle about with lots of derring-do until it finally deploys the technology in a nick-of-time scenario.On to the cast.  Michael Shanks looks somewhat chunkier, but not as much he does in season two of ""Burn Notice.""  Christopher Judge has grown even more hair.  Amanda Tapping, Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Gary Jones and Beau Bridges all look about the same.Overall, an enjoyable adventure.

1127999,AHB0L35LOICAN,B0010YSD7M,"GB Banks (publisher, author) "", author""","[0, 0]","As a long time Stargate SG-1 fan who has come and gone throughout the ten-year run of the series, and had been watching quite regularly for the last couple of years, I was sad to hear that the show was finally coming to an end. When you grow so close to characters that you feel they are as much a part of your life as the real people in your life, the thought of losing these characters can really instill an impending sense of loss within you. And in some ways, I was feeling this very thing as the show neared its end.And then I began hearing about the Stargate movies. While excited to see the films when they came out, I was also apprehensive, because the fatal flaw inherent in the act of anticipation is that such things can rarely live up to one's high expectations. But as it turns out, Stargate - The Ark of Truth far exceeded my expectations.The film picks up and completes the Ori saga which had dominated the series for its last two seasons, and takes us into the Ori galaxy in search of The Ark of Truth, the only device capable of stripping the Ori of their powers by revealing the ""truth"" to their devout followers. The movie is classic Stargate, except it feels bigger, more grand in scale and scope. Even though it wasn't shown on a big screen, you get a bit of the cinematic experience when watching SG-1 travel to the Ori galaxy and doing battle on several different fronts, as always walking on the brink of disaster. While each of the characters get their just moments in the spotlight, Cam Mitchell (played excellently as always by Ben Browder) steals the show with some of the best action scenes I've ever seen in a Stargate show. The movie is a fitting ending to the series as a whole, and also puts a nice cap to the Ori saga.The DVD extras are also nice. My favorites were the behind the scenes special which runs about half an hour, and the footage of the Q &A; session filmed at ComicCon. Getting to see Ben Browser, Amanda Tapping, and Christopher Judge as themselves was quite fun. And for those not familiar with the series or the Ori storyline, there is a prelude which will catch you up on the storyline and lead you right into ""The Ark of Truth.""So if you are a fan of Stargate, or of good adventurous Science Fiction, give ""Stargate - The Ark of Truth,"" a try!- Gregory Bernard Banks, author, reader, reviewer",5,An Exciting Adventure for Loyal Stargate Fans!,1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,2345,"['long', 'time', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'fan', 'who', 'come', 'gone', 'ten-year', 'run', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'watching', 'quite', 'regularly', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'was', 'sad', 'hear', 'show', 'was', 'finally', 'coming', 'end', 'When', 'grow', 'so', 'close', 'characters', 'feel', 'are', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'life', 'real', 'people', 'life', 'thought', 'losing', 'characters', 'can', 'really', 'instill', 'impending', 'sense', 'loss', 'ways', 'was', 'feeling', 'very', 'thing', 'show', 'neared', 'end.And', 'then', 'began', 'hearing', 'Stargate', 'movies', 'excited', 'see', 'films', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'also', 'apprehensive', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'inherent', 'act', 'anticipation', 'such', 'things', 'can', 'rarely', 'live', 'up', 'one', 'high', 'expectations', 'out', 'Stargate', 'Ark', 'Truth', 'far', 'exceeded', 'expectations.The', 'film', 'up', 'Ori', 'saga', 'had', 'dominated', 'series', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'Ori', 'galaxy', 'search', 'Ark', 'Truth', 'only', 'device', 'capable', 'stripping', 'Ori', 'powers', 'revealing', 'truth', 'devout', 'followers', 'movie', 'classic', 'Stargate', 'bigger', 'more', 'grand', 'scale', 'scope', 'Even', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'big', 'screen', 'get', 'bit', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'when', 'watching', 'SG-1', 'travel', 'Ori', 'galaxy', 'doing', 'battle', 'several', 'different', 'fronts', 'always', 'walking', 'brink', 'disaster', 'characters', 'get', 'just', 'moments', 'spotlight', 'Cam', 'Mitchell', 'played', 'excellently', 'always', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'show', 'best', 'action', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Stargate', 'show', 'movie', 'fitting', 'ending', 'series', 'whole', 'also', 'nice', 'cap', 'Ori', 'saga.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'nice', 'favorites', 'were', 'scenes', 'special', 'hour', 'footage', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'filmed', 'ComicCon', 'Getting', 'see', 'Ben', 'Browser', 'Amanda', 'Tapping', 'Christopher', 'Judge', 'was', 'quite', 'fun', 'not', 'familiar', 'series', 'Ori', 'storyline', 'prelude', 'will', 'catch', 'up', 'storyline', 'lead', 'right', 'Ark', 'Truth', 'So', 'are', 'fan', 'Stargate', 'good', 'adventurous', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'give', 'Stargate', 'Ark', 'Truth', 'try', 'Gregory', 'Bernard', 'Banks', 'author', 'reader', 'reviewer']",Stargate - The Ark of Truth

The only episodes I didn't like were the 100th (Wormhole Extreme) and the 200th - and even these had a few good moments.  So when I say I was disappointed in ""The Ark of Truth,"" I say that as someone who greatly appreciates almost every aspect of this show.  I think I may have expected too much from this movie.  When the Ori story arc began, it not only breathed new life into the show, it created an expectation of almost non-stop excitement.  Each new Ori-related episode kept the excitement going and kept adding a little bit more, until I (like so many others, I'm sure) couldn't wait to see the resolution of the story arc.  That's why this was somewhat of a let-down.  It almost seemed in this move that they just wanted to get the Ori over with so they could move on to some other story line.  The final resolution had a very artificial feel to it.  I realize that the show's  weakness (other than it's forays into comedy, which never quite worked) was a tendency to rely too much on a ""Deus Ex Machina"" type of resolution; and that's exactly what happened here.  The resolution didn't proceed from or rise out of the struggles of the SG-1; it was just kind of tacked on at the end.  Don't get me wrong: it was still well worth buying and watching; and I guarantee you, if I had never seen any other Stargate SG-1 story, I'd be shouting its praises from the rooftops.  But I have seen other stories - ten seasons worth of stories.

I know of many occations where a succcessful movie was bled for episodic television fare.  I was delighted in the differance from the Big Screen production and found it's quality writing and winning cast very addictive and enjoyable.  When after Ten years it was taken off Broadcast televison and going to Direct to DVD I was crossing my fingers that this trend would move forward to the new format.  After the first Made for DVD I must say it is a mixed bag.The story attemped to take alot of the concepts the producers were planning for the 11th season and it seems like they tried to jam them into a single feature length setting.  I think knowing the cast and the character development from the past ten years made a big diffeance for me to help  fill in the blanks that they had to race over to make it fit.  I am not sure if it will work the same magic for the newcommer.It had alot of things mixed together in a small box such as the Ori and the Replicators and the Giant Space Gate.  In the end the most evil cuts come from our earthbound evil element in the form of a misguied and compromized EOC agent who makes more of a mess then the Stargate team can handle...Well almost.The sound quality and picure is first rate and the special effects are a point above average from the televison series and the extras are reasonalbe and informative for both new viewers and the more experiance viewer.I concider this a must have for a true SG1 fan and would recomend it for almost any serious fan of good Sci Fi,4,SG1 the next incarnation,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,1607,"['When', 'Stargate', 'SG1', 'first', 'appeared', 'Showtime', 'Pay', 'network', 'was', 'there', 'bit', 'dread', 'know', 'many', 'occations', 'where', 'succcessful', 'movie', 'was', 'bled', 'episodic', 'television', 'fare', 'was', 'delighted', 'differance', 'Big', 'Screen', 'production', 'found', 'quality', 'writing', 'winning', 'cast', 'very', 'addictive', 'enjoyable', 'When', 'Ten', 'years', 'was', 'taken', 'off', 'Broadcast', 'televison', 'going', 'Direct', 'DVD', 'was', 'crossing', 'fingers', 'trend', 'would', 'move', 'forward', 'new', 'format', 'first', 'Made', 'DVD', 'must', 'say', 'mixed', 'bag.The', 'story', 'attemped', 'take', 'alot', 'concepts', 'producers', 'were', 'planning', '11th', 'season', 'tried', 'jam', 'single', 'feature', 'length', 'setting', 'think', 'knowing', 'cast', 'character', 'development', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'made', 'big', 'diffeance', 'help', 'fill', 'blanks', 'had', 'race', 'make', 'fit', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'work', 'same', 'magic', 'newcommer.It', 'had', 'alot', 'things', 'mixed', 'together', 'small', 'box', 'such', 'Ori', 'Replicators', 'Giant', 'Space', 'Gate', 'end', 'most', 'evil', 'cuts', 'come', 'earthbound', 'evil', 'element', 'form', 'misguied', 'compromized', 'EOC', 'agent', 'who', 'more', 'mess', 'then', 'Stargate', 'team', 'can', 'handle', 'Well', 'almost.The', 'sound', 'quality', 'picure', 'first', 'rate', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'point', 'average', 'televison', 'series', 'extras', 'are', 'reasonalbe', 'informative', 'new', 'viewers', 'more', 'experiance', 'viewer.I', 'concider', 'must', 'have', 'true', 'SG1', 'fan', 'would', 'recomend', 'almost', 'serious', 'fan', 'good', 'Sci', 'Fi']",Stargate - The Ark of Truth

1128020,A2QNS95WGN35G9,B0010YSD7M,Jason,"[84, 93]","This review is spoiler free!!I have to preface this review with the statement that I am an avid Stargate fan, and as such, my review may be biased (but I think not!)After enduring season 4 of Atlantis this year, it is nice to get back to the show I truly love, Sg-1.  Opposed to Atlantis, SG-1 takes place on earth, spends time on the explorations, and takes into account ancient mythologies, opposed to Atlantis, which is more action oriented, with dumbed down dialog, and shooting anything that moves.I have been awaiting this release since it was announced, it finally came to my home yesterday, I watched the movie, then the extras (comic con conference which was really cool! and a behind the scenes which was great as well (this is almost 1 hour of material), I then watched the movie again, this time with commentary (again, I love SG-1).This dvd has a ""prelude"" which basically goes over everything you need to freshen up on to fully enjoy and prepare for this viewing.  As someone who has seen each episode of stargate countless times, I found this prelude a great review, as it has been a while since I watched it all.The movie then follows, and it is a great movie. The scenery in this movie is astounding, it looks much better than we are used to seeing on the TV show.  The pacing is slower, more akin to when the show aired on Showtime, which works well, as the aspect of stargate that i enjoy most, is the interactions between the characters, the explorations of new worlds and civilizations, and how everyone reacts to the culture.This brings the conclusion to a satisfying end.  I think several of the cliffhangers are drawn out a bit much (putting a tad too much tension near the end), but all in all, I enjoyed the movie.This reminds me of why I love this show, I know they are coming out with another movie soon (this one will have Richard Dean Anderson in it), and word on the streets is, it should arrive this July.I truly hope people are not just downloading bootleg copies of this dvd, and I really hope everyone will buy this dvd, and the next one.  I really want this show to continue on, if the studios do not get the results they are looking for, this could be the end.I really hope the dvds do sell well, maybe they can continue to do movies throughout the year, and maybe even a mini series or another season.  There are many aspects of the Stargate world that have gone unexplored, and unfinished.I hope the producers read this review, and understand that what make stargate work is not the snappy dialog, the wonderful interactions, the brilliantly designed enemies, sound design, artwork, and constant tension, but the exploration of new worlds, the ability to learn something (ancient history, see ancient figures, the Egyptian gods) and the exploration of these foreign cultures.  Something Stargate Atlantis completely misses, which is why I do not enjoy it as much.I truly hope everyone will buy this dvd, enjoy it, and more get made.I also must comment on the beautiful video quality and sound design, the show has never looked or sounded this good (they did use 35mm film) and it shows.Please keep up the great work, and I hope everyone enjoys this fantastic dvd.(note, if you are a fan of the movie, and haven't watched too much of the series (last 2 seasons--9 and 10) this dvd is likely not for you, do yourself a favor, and buy the complete series collection, and catch up, then enjoy this fantastic dvd, as you will not be able to understand much of what is going on)Also, the creators of the show, are working on a third show, that deals with the ninth chevron, tentatively called ""Stargate Universe"" which is set in present time.

Shocked at the death of their Prior, the Ori soldiers surrender.  When the Ark is activated and opened, the Doci is caught by the beam and made to see that the Ori are not gods and spreads this belief to all of the Priors in the Ori galaxy and through them their followers.

I'm hoping it will be released on CD soon.I was also glad to find that the film did not go ""over the top"" and remained about as family-friendly as the TV series did through the years.

The current story arc was not finished.  This movie did what it needed to do:  it put a satisfying bow on the package.This extended episode has all the elements that made Stargate a phenomenal series.  As always, the writing and dialogue are excellent, the characters have fun and interact well, the sets and effects are what we have come to expect, the plot was fast paced and interesting, and there were balanced amounts of humor and tension and of action and science.  The musical underscoring was superb.  It added to the story, and was delightful to listen to.  And of course, good triumphs over evil, and our heroes ride off to their next adventure, hinting at even more to come.There are only two minor issues with The Ark of Truth.  1.  No Jack.  I really like the new SG-1, but I miss Jack.  2.  As stated earlier, the movie completes the Ori story arc, but it did no more.  It had all the excellent elements of the series, but no more.

Some very hard to even read. How did that get past someone?  Just a nit, but it made me wonder what I was in for.  Caution, spoilers follow.First, I was disappointed that the story revolved around a magic weapon that solves all our problems if we can only find it, which of course we know we will eventually.  That made the whole adventure more or less predictable.What follows is a lot of lets say very conveniently written stuff with some strange transitions.  We've got the Odyssey going through the Super Stargate in one scene and immediately Vala and Daniel are sitting at a table in a villiage in Ori occupied space.  That was easy.Then here come the replicators, again.  Replicators have already been done in the SG-1 series, where they were an original idea to the series, and in Atlantis, where it made me think the Atlantis writers had run out of ideas, and now here they are again!  Once again we are treated to scene after scene of heavy and light machine guns mowing down replicators while the bullets do absolutely no damage to anything that isn't a replicator.  It got corny a while ago, folks.  By the way, why did the characters weld and bolt the doors to the Asgard Core room shut if it had already been established in the show that the little bugs can just melt their way through metal?Then there's the new twist: the gross zombie replicator human, and the endless fight between this thing and Mitchell, which ends with the terminator (er..oops..replicators) forming a human skeleton after all the flesh has been burned away.Why is it that all of a sudden these Ori mother ships aren't so tough, and four of them can pound away at the Odyssey for endless minutes while the replicator problem is taken care of, and then once the replicators are defeated the Ori ships all of a sudden become an urgent threat again?How can Teal'c get a Ori weapon blast in the back, get left for dead, and in the morning feel great enough to go mountain climbing, complete with incredibly corny not-too-Stargate-like melodramatic music playing?  He falls flat on his face but gets supernatural help to recover.  Later, he somehow penetrates the Ori city and shows up in a Pryor's uniform to rescue our heros, but we never get to see how he did it!One thing I forgot to mention at first, Samantha Carter seems to come across more like a soccer mom than a military person.  Maybe because her hair seemed long for a military person, or because she baked cookies for Mitchell and kissed him on the cheek while she had her hair completely down while on base at the end of the episode.  I don't know, but something seemed tweaked about Sam.  Of course, I'm not caught up on season four of Atlantis.Finally, the super villian in this story is dispatched just the way the super villian Anubis is dispatched in the Threads episode.Anyway, I thought will all the extra time available to make this movie I'd get to see something fresh and somewhat original, but it was the same old same old.  At least the Ori story arc was brought to a close.Bottom line: see if you can see it without paying full retail.",3,The truth is I was disappointed.,1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,3425,"['Sure', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'characters', 'more', 'old', 'friends', 'now', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'ended', 'long', 'awaited', 'TV', 'movie', 'felt', 'more', 'two', 'average', 'episodes', 'anything', 'hoped', 'would', 'be.I', 'thought', 'something', 'was', 'strange', 'when', 'opening', 'credits', 'were', 'white', 'letters', 'white', 'snow', 'mountains', 'very', 'hard', 'even', 'read', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'someone', 'Just', 'nit', 'made', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'Caution', 'spoilers', 'follow.First', 'was', 'disappointed', 'story', 'revolved', 'magic', 'weapon', 'problems', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'course', 'know', 'will', 'eventually', 'made', 'whole', 'adventure', 'more', 'less', 'predictable.What', 'lot', 'lets', 'say', 'very', 'conveniently', 'written', 'stuff', 'strange', 'transitions', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Odyssey', 'going', 'Super', 'Stargate', 'one', 'scene', 'immediately', 'Vala', 'Daniel', 'are', 'sitting', 'table', 'villiage', 'Ori', 'occupied', 'space', 'was', 'easy.Then', 'here', 'come', 'replicators', 'again', 'Replicators', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'SG-1', 'series', 'where', 'were', 'original', 'idea', 'series', 'Atlantis', 'where', 'made', 'think', 'Atlantis', 'writers', 'had', 'run', 'ideas', 'now', 'here', 'are', 'again', 'Once', 'again', 'are', 'treated', 'scene', 'scene', 'heavy', 'light', 'machine', 'guns', 'mowing', 'down', 'replicators', 'bullets', 'do', 'absolutely', 'damage', 'anything', ""n't"", 'replicator', 'got', 'while', 'ago', 'folks', 'way', 'why', 'did', 'characters', 'weld', 'bolt', 'doors', 'Asgard', 'Core', 'room', 'shut', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'established', 'show', 'little', 'bugs', 'can', 'just', 'melt', 'way', 'metal', 'Then', 'new', 'twist', 'gross', 'zombie', 'replicator', 'human', 'endless', 'fight', 'thing', 'Mitchell', 'terminator', 'er..oops..replicators', 'forming', 'human', 'skeleton', 'flesh', 'been', 'burned', 'away.Why', 'sudden', 'Ori', 'mother', 'ships', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'tough', 'four', 'can', 'pound', 'away', 'Odyssey', 'endless', 'minutes', 'replicator', 'problem', 'taken', 'care', 'then', 'once', 'replicators', 'are', 'defeated', 'Ori', 'sudden', 'become', 'urgent', 'threat', 'again', 'How', 'can', 'Teal', 'c', 'get', 'Ori', 'weapon', 'blast', 'back', 'get', 'left', 'dead', 'morning', 'feel', 'great', 'enough', 'go', 'mountain', 'climbing', 'complete', 'incredibly', 'corny', 'not-too-Stargate-like', 'melodramatic', 'music', 'playing', 'flat', 'face', 'supernatural', 'help', 'recover', 'Later', 'somehow', 'Ori', 'city', 'up', 'Pryor', 'uniform', 'rescue', 'heros', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'did', 'One', 'thing', 'forgot', 'mention', 'first', 'Samantha', 'Carter', 'come', 'more', 'soccer', 'mom', 'military', 'person', 'Maybe', 'hair', 'seemed', 'long', 'military', 'person', 'baked', 'cookies', 'Mitchell', 'kissed', 'cheek', 'had', 'hair', 'completely', 'down', 'base', 'end', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'something', 'seemed', 'tweaked', 'Sam', 'course', ""'m"", 'not', 'caught', 'up', 'season', 'four', 'Atlantis.Finally', 'super', 'villian', 'story', 'dispatched', 'just', 'way', 'super', 'villian', 'Anubis', 'dispatched', 'Threads', 'episode.Anyway', 'thought', 'will', 'all', 'extra', 'time', 'available', 'make', 'movie', ""'d"", 'get', 'see', 'something', 'fresh', 'somewhat', 'original', 'was', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'least', 'Ori', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'brought', 'close.Bottom', 'line', 'see', 'can', 'see', 'paying', 'full', 'retail']",Stargate - The Ark of Truth

My entire experience with this series has been through the DVD releases and while I have enjoyed most of the seasons, there have been more than their fair share of poorly produced episodes, yet I've stuck with the series.Having purchased every set of the Stargate SG-1 series as well as Stargate Atlantis, I was amped up when I purchased this DVD, the final battle with the Ori and never, in my life, have I been so disappointed in this series than I have with Stargate: The Ark of Truth.First off, MGM had overhyped this release to death giving fans of the series the impression that this was the end all battle with the Ori. After finally purchasing this DVD I was so severely disappointed with the movie that I felt robbed of the $18 I had spent on it.Instead of getting a feature length movie of SG1's battle with the Ori, we're treated to an hour and ten minutes (1:10) of battle with the Replicators. The Ori are nowhere to be seen with the small exception of the opening of the movie as well as the ending of the movie during the final battle with Adria.While I'm not dismissing the series at all, I would suggest that if you're thinking about buying this movie, don't.

1128055,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B0010YSD7M,Matthew Kresal,"[5, 7]","Leaving the Ori storyline unresolved at the end of Sg-1's final season, the makers of the show give us this film. The Ark Of Truth lives up the hype of fans hoping for an epic end to the storyline that drove the show's final two seasons.  Indeed, The Ark Of Truth proves to be both an epic and fitting end to the Ori storyline.In fact one might go so far as to assume that the show never ended. From the performances of SG-1's members, it's just like picking up where Unending left off. In particular Michael Shanks and Ben Browder both get to shine in their roles of Daniel Jackson and Cameron Mitchell. That's not to say the rest of cast doesn't, but Shanks and Browder really do stand out in this. The supporting cast does too from Beau Bridges to Sarah Strange, from Sarah Strange to the villainous Julian Sands and the absolutely evil Morena Baccarin. The real stand out of the supporting cast however is Currie Graham as Merrick, the double crossing IOA supervisor.The rest of the production is also first rate for the film, in both writing and production values, is epic. There is a scope to the film that wasn't possible for the show on television. The story feels epic, taking us from Earth to the Ori galaxy and back again. The story has so much going on though that we don't get to see some of the things fans would like to have seen but we see enough to keep everyone happy. The effects and photography aren't just as good as they were on the show, they're better. They go from mountains in the opening credits, the ruins of Dakarra and the Altaran city, to the Ark itself: something that was hard (if not impossible) for the series to do with even a two-part two of the series. There's also one or two moments that evoke memories of the original movie from years ago and fans should get a smile out of it. There's one other thing to mention: the music. The music by Joel Goldsmith is just as epic as the film, evoking not just the original Stargate theme by David Arnold but the Germanic chants of the Ori themes and heroic themes for the team. But the real treat of the music is that while it may be familiar, you've never heard it played this. Fans of the series won't be disappointed. Everything that made us love the series is still here and thriving.Not to say the film is perfect, which it isn't. Some parts of the film don't make a lot of sense such as the IOA's actions. They don't make much sense especially when they resurrect an old enemy from the series in the process. I won't spoil it because it makes for a great plot twist, but in retrospect it just feels like padding. There's also the odd flashbacks to the Altarans involving the Ark which, while they add some texture, really might not have been needed. But these are minor flaws, and its hard to find anything without any.The DVD has bonus features for any of the series to enjoy. From Comic-Con to a making of documentary, fans get the chance to go behind the scenes of the film and its promotion. There's also a short semi-preview of the second direct to DVD SG-1 movie to tease fans with. But the mains tar of the bonus features is the commentary by writer/director Robert C. Cooper, cinematographer Peter Woeste, and actor Christopher Judge. Their commentary talks about not just the making of the film, but the attempts to make the film larger and better then the series and the difficulties in doing so. For fans the commentary is a must-hear.In short, The Ark Of Truth is a good film. It does exactly what it was supposed to do: be both an epic and fitting end to the Ori storyline. It succeeds for the most part, though it does have some flaws to it. While non-fans might want to watch the Prelude on the DVD to catch-up on all the plotlines going on in the film, fans should enjoy it. If this and Continuum, the yet to be released second film, are to be the final end of Stargate SG-1, they will be the fitting end of the series.",5,The Fitting And Epic End Of The Ori Storyline,1205280000,"03 12, 2008",2008,3921,"['Leaving', 'Ori', 'storyline', 'unresolved', 'end', 'Sg-1', 'final', 'season', 'makers', 'show', 'give', 'film', 'Ark', 'Truth', 'up', 'hype', 'fans', 'hoping', 'epic', 'end', 'storyline', 'drove', 'show', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'Indeed', 'Ark', 'Truth', 'be', 'epic', 'fitting', 'end', 'Ori', 'storyline.In', 'fact', 'one', 'might', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'assume', 'show', 'never', 'ended', 'performances', 'SG-1', 'members', 'just', 'picking', 'up', 'where', 'Unending', 'left', 'off', 'particular', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'get', 'shine', 'roles', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'not', 'say', 'rest', 'cast', ""n't"", 'Shanks', 'Browder', 'really', 'do', 'stand', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'too', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Sarah', 'Strange', 'Sarah', 'Strange', 'villainous', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'absolutely', 'evil', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'real', 'stand', 'supporting', 'cast', 'however', 'Currie', 'Graham', 'Merrick', 'double', 'crossing', 'IOA', 'supervisor.The', 'rest', 'production', 'also', 'first', 'rate', 'film', 'writing', 'production', 'values', 'epic', 'scope', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'possible', 'show', 'television', 'story', 'feels', 'epic', 'taking', 'Earth', 'Ori', 'galaxy', 'back', 'again', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'things', 'fans', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'see', 'enough', 'keep', 'everyone', 'happy', 'effects', 'photography', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'as', 'good', 'were', 'show', ""'re"", 'better', 'go', 'mountains', 'opening', 'credits', 'ruins', 'Dakarra', 'Altaran', 'city', 'Ark', 'something', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'impossible', 'series', 'do', 'even', 'two-part', 'two', 'series', 'also', 'one', 'two', 'moments', 'evoke', 'memories', 'original', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'fans', 'should', 'get', 'smile', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'mention', 'music', 'music', 'Joel', 'Goldsmith', 'just', 'as', 'epic', 'film', 'evoking', 'not', 'just', 'original', 'Stargate', 'theme', 'David', 'Arnold', 'Germanic', 'chants', 'Ori', 'themes', 'heroic', 'themes', 'team', 'real', 'treat', 'music', 'may', 'be', 'familiar', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'played', 'Fans', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'Everything', 'made', 'love', 'series', 'still', 'here', 'thriving.Not', 'say', 'film', 'perfect', ""n't"", 'parts', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'such', 'IOA', 'actions', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'especially', 'when', 'resurrect', 'old', 'enemy', 'series', 'process', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'great', 'plot', 'twist', 'retrospect', 'just', 'feels', 'padding', 'also', 'odd', 'flashbacks', 'Altarans', 'involving', 'Ark', 'add', 'texture', 'really', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'needed', 'are', 'minor', 'flaws', 'hard', 'find', 'anything', 'any.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'series', 'enjoy', 'Comic-Con', 'making', 'documentary', 'fans', 'get', 'chance', 'go', 'scenes', 'film', 'promotion', 'also', 'short', 'semi-preview', 'second', 'direct', 'DVD', 'SG-1', 'movie', 'tease', 'fans', 'mains', 'tar', 'bonus', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Robert', 'C.', 'Cooper', 'cinematographer', 'Peter', 'Woeste', 'actor', 'Christopher', 'Judge', 'commentary', 'talks', 'not', 'just', 'making', 'film', 'attempts', 'make', 'film', 'larger', 'better', 'then', 'series', 'difficulties', 'doing', 'so', 'fans', 'commentary', 'must-hear.In', 'short', 'Ark', 'Truth', 'good', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'do', 'be', 'epic', 'fitting', 'end', 'Ori', 'storyline', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'flaws', 'non-fans', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'Prelude', 'DVD', 'catch-up', 'plotlines', 'going', 'film', 'fans', 'should', 'enjoy', 'Continuum', 'yet', 'be', 'released', 'second', 'film', 'are', 'be', 'final', 'end', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'will', 'be', 'fitting', 'end', 'series']",Stargate - The Ark of Truth

However, there are still unresolved stories -- like whatever happened to the Harsesis (spelling correct?) child, or Laira from A Hundred Days, or the Tok'ra.  Were all the Tolans really killed, so whatever happened to Schroedinger the cat?  What about the Furlings, and who are the enemy/rescuers in episodes Enemies and Grace?  The Ori story thankfully comes to an end, but not a spectacular one.  It would have been far more interesting to have gotten all the Ancients to finally have battled the Ori, but the writers didn't go there.  Still, this episode is quite good, with really fine acting from Shanks and Tapping and Judge.  For the Farscape cast, Claudia Black seems a bit out of character, like she's tired of Vala (so am I) -- and a grinning Tomin doesn't seem quite right either -- but Browder does well, right in character, though he does get beaten up a lot.  The soundtrack is often intrusive, as if they want you to know that this is a true film and not just part of the series, where the soundtrack never intruded.  And there are portions that include singing like Gregorian chants, okay if you like that stuff but annoying otherwise.  Sorry to say, the writers also brought back an old, dead plot element -- it seems like whenever they don't know what to do, either in SG-1 or Atlantis, they resurrect the replicators.  Ho-hum.  And at the end, they could have spent a bit more time building the drama, since for me it fell a little flat.  I did enjoy Beau Bridges, who is the best of the Stargate generals.

BABYLON 5 and STARGATE SG-1 both have some pretty fanatical fans.  As a television series, I think BABYLON 5 was much the better of the two.  It took greater risks in its storytelling and did more to develop the possibilities of television SF.  On nearly every level, B5 was the more substantial show.  Nonetheless, most of the B5 movies simply were not very good.  STARGATE SG1: THE ARK OF TRUTH is, on the other hand, very good indeed.Of course, one reason the movie is so good was because a number of important plot threads were left unresolved.  Gestures had been made toward the resolution of the Ori story, but it certainly hadn't been completed.  And I loved the fact that the series finale was devoted not to plot resolution but to spending time with the main cast members.  It was a very satisfying, relatively unambitious series finale.  But since the main appeal of the show had always been the main group of characters, it was completely appropriate.  ARK OF TRUTH managed to very satisfyingly wrap up the Ori story.I suppose any individual might find reason to complain about one or other aspect of the film.  I always enjoy more rather than less Daniel Jackson, but here he didn't get as much of a hand in the story as usual.  I also really love a lot of Vala, especially when wearing nice midriffs, but as Claudia Black was pregnant during the filming of the film that wouldn't work.  I'm not sure precisely how pregnant she was, but let's just say she got to wear a lot of body armor in this one.We not only got a resolution to the Ori arc, but we got to revisit our friends the Replicators.  Always got to love the Replicators.This movie historically could prove to be of considerable importance, for good or ill.  Studios have been struggling with the whole idea of direct to DVD movies.  They are aware that there are several shows that have a cadre of extremely dedicated fans.  The question so far has been how to take advantage for the studio of this core group of fans in a way that satisfies the fans and makes business sense for the studios.  The main show in this regard has been FIREFLY.  Although cancelled after only 11 episodes were broadcast (though others were made), the series became one of the steadiest selling series in the history of television.  But here is where the story gets complex.  Turning FIREFLY into the movie SERENITY proved a box office disaster, with the movie failing to make back its costs.  But then once again the story gets complex.  SERENITY became a significant profit maker due to its DVD sales, to the point where a new and expanded DVD was released, which continues to sell well.  Now Universal is contemplating a second SERENITY movie.  But here is the dilemma.  Do they make another regular theater release film?  Or do they just go direct to DVD?This is why STARGATE -- THE ARK OF TRUTH is so important.  If its sales are good and make a profit for the studio (also, there is a second STARGATE coming out this summer), then it could encourage other studios to take a risk with direct to DVD movies.  If both the STARGATE movies make money, then we might not only see SERENITY 2 (different studio, but this is something the industry is watching) but other beloved shows continue through direct to DVD productions.So keep your fingers crossed!  Better yet, go buy a copy of the movie.  If this movie does well, we all stand to benefit not merely by additional STARGATE films, but other films and shows as well.",4,A very pleasant surprise -- definitely builds on the series,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,3580,"[""'m"", 'going', 'open', 'politically', 'charged', 'statement', 'bear', ""'m"", 'trying', 'make', 'sense', '5', 'STARGATE', 'SG-1', 'have', 'pretty', 'fanatical', 'fans', 'television', 'series', 'think', 'BABYLON', '5', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'two', 'took', 'greater', 'risks', 'storytelling', 'did', 'more', 'develop', 'possibilities', 'television', 'SF', 'nearly', 'level', 'B5', 'was', 'more', 'substantial', 'show', 'Nonetheless', 'most', 'B5', 'movies', 'simply', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'STARGATE', 'SG1', 'ARK', 'OF', 'TRUTH', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'good', 'indeed.Of', 'course', 'one', 'reason', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'number', 'important', 'plot', 'threads', 'were', 'left', 'unresolved', 'Gestures', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'resolution', 'Ori', 'story', 'certainly', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'completed', 'loved', 'fact', 'series', 'finale', 'was', 'devoted', 'not', 'plot', 'resolution', 'spending', 'time', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'was', 'very', 'satisfying', 'relatively', 'unambitious', 'series', 'finale', 'main', 'appeal', 'show', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'main', 'group', 'characters', 'was', 'completely', 'appropriate', 'ARK', 'OF', 'TRUTH', 'managed', 'very', 'satisfyingly', 'wrap', 'up', 'Ori', 'story.I', 'suppose', 'individual', 'might', 'find', 'reason', 'complain', 'one', 'other', 'aspect', 'film', 'always', 'enjoy', 'more', 'rather', 'less', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'hand', 'story', 'usual', 'also', 'really', 'love', 'lot', 'Vala', 'especially', 'when', 'wearing', 'nice', 'midriffs', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'was', 'pregnant', 'filming', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'precisely', 'how', 'pregnant', 'was', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'got', 'wear', 'lot', 'body', 'armor', 'one.We', 'not', 'only', 'got', 'resolution', 'Ori', 'arc', 'got', 'revisit', 'friends', 'Replicators', 'Always', 'got', 'love', 'Replicators.This', 'movie', 'historically', 'could', 'prove', 'be', 'considerable', 'importance', 'good', 'ill.', 'Studios', 'have', 'been', 'struggling', 'whole', 'idea', 'direct', 'DVD', 'movies', 'are', 'aware', 'are', 'several', 'shows', 'have', 'cadre', 'extremely', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'question', 'so', 'far', 'been', 'how', 'take', 'advantage', 'studio', 'core', 'group', 'fans', 'way', 'fans', 'business', 'sense', 'studios', 'main', 'show', 'regard', 'been', 'FIREFLY', 'cancelled', 'only', '11', 'episodes', 'were', 'broadcast', 'others', 'were', 'made', 'series', 'became', 'one', 'steadiest', 'selling', 'series', 'history', 'television', 'here', 'where', 'story', 'complex', 'Turning', 'FIREFLY', 'movie', 'SERENITY', 'proved', 'box', 'office', 'disaster', 'movie', 'failing', 'make', 'back', 'costs', 'then', 'once', 'again', 'story', 'complex', 'SERENITY', 'became', 'significant', 'profit', 'maker', 'due', 'DVD', 'sales', 'point', 'where', 'new', 'expanded', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'sell', 'well', 'Now', 'Universal', 'contemplating', 'second', 'SERENITY', 'movie', 'here', 'dilemma', 'Do', 'make', 'regular', 'theater', 'release', 'film', 'do', 'just', 'go', 'direct', 'DVD', 'why', 'STARGATE', 'ARK', 'OF', 'TRUTH', 'so', 'important', 'sales', 'are', 'good', 'make', 'profit', 'studio', 'also', 'second', 'STARGATE', 'coming', 'out', 'summer', 'then', 'could', 'encourage', 'other', 'studios', 'take', 'risk', 'direct', 'DVD', 'movies', 'STARGATE', 'movies', 'make', 'money', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'SERENITY', '2', 'different', 'studio', 'something', 'industry', 'watching', 'other', 'beloved', 'shows', 'continue', 'direct', 'DVD', 'productions.So', 'keep', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'Better', 'yet', 'go', 'buy', 'copy', 'movie', 'movie', 'well', 'stand', 'benefit', 'not', 'merely', 'additional', 'STARGATE', 'films', 'other', 'films', 'as', 'well']",Stargate - The Ark of Truth
