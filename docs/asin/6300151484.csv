If you come across this one, whatever you do with it, don't watch it. You'll regret it.The bad acting at the beginning of the film tips you off to the crap that will follow. A man gets an unwanted TV in the mail. It won't turn off, even when he unplugs it, and the only thing it plays is a movie called ""Zombie Blood Massacre."" The zombies climb out of the TV and kill the guy.Later, another family moves into the house. The parents are out of the country, so it's just the teenage son and daughter. The son discovers the TV, brings it to his room, and some weird naked chick comes out of it. I might mention that the zombie makeup is terrible, and while they don't talk, they're very cartoonish and have a really bad sense of humor.Well the next time the Texan comes to visit, the boy lets him in. He tells a really ludicrous story about the ""video dead"" who believe they're still alive and get really angry when they see themselves in a mirror. So the way to convince them they're dead is to kill them like you would a person. Which lead to an almost-laughable scene where they're shooting zombies with bows and arrows. [groan]Avoid this piece of zombie fodder at all costs. I don't know what the writer was thinking, or if he was thinking at all, when he wrote this.

Months later, a new family moves in the same house yet it's only a sister and her brother as he discovers the TV in his room. However, the undead are unleashed in the woods near the house as it starts killing off some neighbors as they must try to find a way to kill them to send them back into the TV.This 1987 supernatural zombie horror film is typical of the low budget direct to video films of it's day yet it did had a limited theatrical release in some places. It has bad acting, a weak plot and some cheesy make-up yet there is some good dosage of gore like chainsawing, flesh-eating including that creepy nightmare of the Zoe getting her hand eaten off and all that with some nudity like a very sexy lady played by Jennifer Miro who comes out nude to seduce Jeff. This movie does have similarities to the Japanese ""Ringu"" movies but this was made years before that movie and i'm sure this inspired them big time, i remembered renting this movie when it first came out when i was 6 and thought it was decent.I gotta say it's one of those so bad it's good kind of films that anyone can do home MST3K-ing with and it has never had a DVD release until now on the Video-Dead/Terrorvision double feature blu-ray/DVD combo pack from Scream Factory.",3,A decent 80s zombie film,1367798400,"05 6, 2013",2013,1514,"['mysterious', 'unmarked', 'crate', 'been', 'delivered', 'houseowner', 'revealing', 'ordinary', 'looking', 'TV', 'zombie', 'movie', 'TV', 'yet', 'however', 'dark', 'magic', 'magic', 'force', 'zombies', 'TV', 'kill', 'owner', 'Months', 'later', 'new', 'family', 'moves', 'same', 'house', 'yet', 'only', 'sister', 'brother', 'TV', 'room', 'However', 'undead', 'are', 'unleashed', 'woods', 'house', 'killing', 'off', 'neighbors', 'must', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'kill', 'send', 'back', 'TV.This', '1987', 'supernatural', 'zombie', 'horror', 'film', 'typical', 'low', 'budget', 'direct', 'video', 'films', 'day', 'yet', 'did', 'had', 'limited', 'theatrical', 'release', 'places', 'bad', 'acting', 'weak', 'plot', 'cheesy', 'make-up', 'yet', 'good', 'dosage', 'gore', 'chainsawing', 'flesh-eating', 'including', 'creepy', 'nightmare', 'Zoe', 'getting', 'hand', 'eaten', 'off', 'nudity', 'very', 'sexy', 'lady', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Miro', 'who', 'out', 'nude', 'seduce', 'Jeff', 'movie', 'have', 'similarities', 'Japanese', 'Ringu', 'movies', 'was', 'made', 'years', 'movie', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'inspired', 'big', 'time', 'i', 'remembered', 'renting', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'i', 'was', '6', 'thought', 'was', 'decent.I', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'one', 'bad', 'good', 'kind', 'films', 'anyone', 'can', 'do', 'home', 'MST3K-ing', 'never', 'had', 'DVD', 'release', 'now', 'Video-Dead/Terrorvision', 'double', 'feature', 'blu-ray/DVD', 'combo', 'pack', 'Scream', 'Factory']",Video Dead VHS
197450,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6300151484,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","The Video Dead (Robert Scott, 1987)Somewhat surprisingly, The Video Dead is not the dumbest movie I've seen this month. In fact, it's not even the dumbest movie I've seen all day, though it was in the running for quite a while. Once you've been immersed in this mess long enough, however, if you're old enough--forty or so, old enough to have been in high school when it appeared--it develops of sort of nostalgic, if masochist, charm. It really is that dumb, and it transcends dumb into a sort of odd cheesy glory.We open with a reclusive man getting a TV delivered. No word on why, as he's as confused as we are. Cut to that night, and a horrible scream. Fast forward three months, and a family is moving into the same house--well, actually, the advance guard of the family, consisting of college student Zoe Blair (Roxanna Augesen, who according to IMDB appeared onscreen only this once) and her high school aged brother Jeff (Rocky Duvall, who likewise never appeared onscreen again). While poking around in the house, Jeff discovers the TV from the first scene in the attic and brings it downstairs. Cue ominous music. We soon find out what happened to the guy from the first scene, as the TV, when activated, spews zombies. Yes, folks, zombies come out of the TV. While they didn't leave the house during the opening scene, they soon find themselves wandering around the neighborhood, killing the neighbors in amusing ways, while brother and sister try and figure out how to stay alive.If you've seen a few late eighties horror movies solidly in the B realm, you've probably got an idea of what to expect here. Really silly humor, average-at-best special effects, a script that attempts to tug at the heartstrings (and most often fails), but, especially when compared to today's microbudget horror movies, competent acting, direction, and especially lighting. No parts that aren't too dark to see. Hallelujah! Of course, there's not a great deal here you couldn't miss, but it's still kind of fun if you remember it from back in the day, or movies like it. **",2,"Oh, such silliness.",1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,2065,"['Video', 'Dead', 'Robert', 'Scott', '1987', 'Somewhat', 'surprisingly', 'Video', 'Dead', 'not', 'dumbest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'month', 'fact', 'not', 'even', 'dumbest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'day', 'was', 'running', 'while', 'Once', ""'ve"", 'been', 'immersed', 'mess', 'long', 'enough', 'however', ""'re"", 'old', 'enough', 'forty', 'so', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'appeared', 'sort', 'nostalgic', 'masochist', 'charm', 'really', 'dumb', 'dumb', 'sort', 'odd', 'cheesy', 'glory.We', 'open', 'reclusive', 'man', 'getting', 'TV', 'delivered', 'word', 'why', 'as', 'confused', 'are', 'Cut', 'night', 'horrible', 'scream', 'Fast', 'forward', 'three', 'months', 'family', 'moving', 'same', 'house', 'well', 'actually', 'advance', 'guard', 'family', 'consisting', 'college', 'student', 'Zoe', 'Blair', 'Roxanna', 'Augesen', 'who', 'according', 'IMDB', 'appeared', 'onscreen', 'only', 'once', 'high', 'school', 'aged', 'brother', 'Jeff', 'Rocky', 'Duvall', 'who', 'likewise', 'never', 'appeared', 'onscreen', 'again', 'poking', 'around', 'house', 'Jeff', 'TV', 'first', 'scene', 'attic', 'Cue', 'ominous', 'music', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'guy', 'first', 'scene', 'TV', 'when', 'activated', 'spews', 'zombies', 'Yes', 'folks', 'zombies', 'come', 'TV', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'house', 'opening', 'scene', 'soon', 'find', 'wandering', 'neighborhood', 'killing', 'neighbors', 'amusing', 'ways', 'brother', 'sister', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'stay', 'alive.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'late', 'eighties', 'horror', 'movies', 'solidly', 'B', 'realm', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'got', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'here', 'Really', 'silly', 'humor', 'average-at-best', 'special', 'effects', 'script', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'most', 'often', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'today', 'microbudget', 'horror', 'movies', 'competent', 'acting', 'direction', 'especially', 'lighting', 'parts', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'dark', 'see', 'Hallelujah', 'course', 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'here', 'could', ""n't"", 'miss', 'still', 'kind', 'fun', 'remember', 'back', 'day', 'movies', '**']",Video Dead VHS
197451,A3UA046AA3DXFD,6300151484,Sid the Elf,"[0, 0]","As this review is being written we're still attempting to understand exactly what it is that we just watched. To call this movie B would be an understatement of epic proportions as it would fall more into a D grade at best. To some this would be a turnoff, but for us this is a fantastic selling point. We've never strayed from a challenge. We believe this fearless movie viewing was established when we were just kids. That day we stumbled across a VHS copy of Wicked Games in our local video store set the tone for our movie viewing future. Even when the video clerk said ""I don't know if I can rent this out, I don't even know how this got here"" we didn't accept his discouragement. No sir! We forged ahead and watched one of the worst films to ever be created , and we did it with gusto. After that moment we just knew that finding the world's worst B's was going to be a lifetime hobby that's still going strong. We can assure you that if we stumbled across The Video Day all those years ago, it would have been watched with a great amount of laughs and may have even become legendary like a Wicked Games. Now just to be clear, this movie is absolutely horrible in every way possible. However, it is highly enjoyable when you're sporting a nice pair of rose tinted-B movie viewing glasses.We'll do our best to explain this plot but can't guarantee it will make a whole lot of sense. We open with a couple of delivery men dropping off an unmarked box for some guy who looks like he hasn't seen a shower in a couple weeks. He reluctantly accepts and finds the package contains a tv. The tv turns on by itself and only tunes in to what appears to be a zombie movie. However, this tv is not of this world. Turns out the zombies use it as a portal to come through to our world and they kill the living, starting with un-showered slob. We awkwardly flash forward three weeks as a new family moves into the house. For some reason the parents are not around, but their kids Jeff and Zoe move in without them. These highly challenged actors are our main characters. This was probably the first and last time they got the opportunity to be labeled as ""main characters"" in anything. Jeff stumbles upon this tv in the attic and brings it into his room. Some weird guy with a cowboy hat shows up at the door talking about the evil tv, but Jeff's not buying it. Once the zombies start plowing through the house he reconsiders quickly. Eventually the cowboy reappears and he and Jeff team up to stop the zombie force. For some reason the zombies wander around the woods aimlessly despite knowing exactly where their victims live, so our demented duo hit the woods to stop the chaos. These two are the most incredible duo since Zap Rowsdower and Troy McGregor took the silver screen by storm. Now we're gonna go in there and take this place by storm. The acting between these two is so horrendous that you're brain will barely be able to process what's going on. In fact you'll be rooting for the zombies. These two puds are so useless that they make no progress and wind up being killed by the zombies they were hunting. This leaves Zoe to be the only remaining soul to save the day. She does this by inviting the zombies in the house for dinner and treating them like normal people. I guess they're like bees and won't attack unless they smell fear. When she invites them into the basement for dancing lessons, this actually happened, she gets them to pile back into the tv saving the day for the time being.If you needed to watch a movie with crater sized pot holes and some of the film industries worst acting, then The Video Dead is an absolute perfect fit. Conceptually the film was fantastic with a pretty solid idea taking place. Having zombies plow through your tv is a situation nobody would want to be involved in. Somehow they managed to take this concept and mess it all up in the end. The movie consisted of about 10 characters total (including the zombies) in which not a sole could act their way out of a paper bag. The poorly spouted lines were a thing a pure hilarity at every turn. It almost appeared as if they were ad libbing, but none of them could be intelligent enough to pull that off.  At no moment will you really know what's going on, but that's the beauty of films like these. Forget a film you don't have to think about. With this one you won't even need to be conscious. Quite possibly the best part is when the cowboy ties Jeff up so he's dangling from some trees as human bait. This is to lure the zombies in while the cowboy picks them off one by one. When the cowboy takes an impromptu nap the zombies just about rip Jeff's legs off while he screams like a 5 years old girl. It is a classic scene that should have won multiple awards if the film academy wasn't so corrupt. We strongly recommend The Video Dead for one of those nights you need a mindless 80's B horror to take away an hour and a half of your life. At no point will it make sense, but you will laugh on way more than one occasion.",4,You kids and your video machines!,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,5019,"['review', 'being', 'written', ""'re"",
