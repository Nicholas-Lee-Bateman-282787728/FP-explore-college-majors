1678713,AIWDJ3S85O10Q,B00GLT2TR6,Edward Aycock,"[14, 16]","In the first episode of Season two, Lila tells a character that the beach at the China Beach R&R Center is closed as it's being swept for mines and we know we're in new territory of the show. In Season One, the Vietnam War was present but more of a backdrop. In Season Two of &#34;China Beach,&#34; the horrors of war are dealt with straight on as various characters face the reality it has on themselves and others.  So what's new in Season Two?  Well, Laurette the USO singer is gone and McMurphy (Dana Delany who won an Emmy for this season) has two new roommates: former Saigon weathergirl Airman Wayloo Marie Holmes and the memorable Pfc. Frankie Bunsen (played by the wonderful Nancy Giles.)  John Wells joined as a producer in Season Two and from the start, you can see his handiwork.  The season premiere two-parter moves fast, introducing characters and situations and disposing of others.  We learn more about the characters themselves- from Boonie's mysterious war injury to Becket's romance with a Vietnamese widow. Lila has been retrofitted from some mother hen character in Season One to tough Army brass and Cherry finds her voice.  The season also has some real surprises- a shocking death, the episode &#34;Vets&#34; where real-life Vietnam vets discuss their experiences during the war and McMurphy visiting home to a strange new world.  Season Two is top notch all the way.  It's funny and moving and sad.

No, not the P.R. mission from SAIGON to HANOI to DA NANG or wherever.  This show lets us have a glimpse into the Hearts and Minds of all its characters who serve either in the medivac hospital unit at China Beach or the troops who pass through to or from the front lines. If you're thinking &#34;MASH&#34; think again. This show is short on laughs and long on realism. We see the war through the eyes of a NURSE LT COLLEEN McMURPHY played by Dana Delany, who I was deeply IN LOVE WITH back when the show was on. After the first couple of episodes I'm IN LOVE AGAIN. The characters are wonderful. A good example is the Donut Dolly named CHERRY. What a NAME for a girl in the 'NAM.  Well, Let me tell you something.

Brown""","[1, 7]","China Beach was a ground-breaking series not just because it was an unapologetic view of war but centered on fully dimensional women.  Strong writing, beautiful imagery, and a sense of humor while showing the horrors of war.  The main cast is almost exclusively made up of characters who aren't on the front lines, but are nonetheless in a war zone, and there isn't a film that does a better job at telling the stories of that American experience than this television series.If I was rating and reviewing this based on the content alone, it would be the highest rating possible.Unfortunately, the quality of the DVDs is sub-par at best.  I expected a low-definition resolution and a lot of black on the screen because it was filmed we , and that's aside from the not including the  at best.
