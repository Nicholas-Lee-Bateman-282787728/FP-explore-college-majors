If you like British drama I would advise you to give this a try, I'm sure you will not regret it as it blends a good storyline with great acting and high production values. It accurately portrays the Welsh valleys of the time, (early 1960's), with both serious and comedic elements, very highly recommended.",5,"A little gem, highly recommended",1330560000,"03 1, 2012",2012,544,"['programme', 'was', 'original', 'shown', 'afternoon', 'BBC', 'UK', 'subsequently', 'be', 'shown', 'several', 'more', 'times', 'more', 'peak', 'viewing', 'times', 'was', 'due', 'great', 'acclaim', 'received', 'critics', 'public', 'alike', 'like', 'British', 'drama', 'would', 'advise', 'give', 'try', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'good', 'storyline', 'great', 'acting', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'accurately', 'Welsh', 'valleys', 'time', 'early', '1960', 'serious', 'comedic', 'elements', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended']",Indian Doctor Series One

There is something about the new guy in town that puts peoples' backs up-until the new guy has to save the day.  The point of view is that of the observer, seldom of the new guy.  It takes some skill to get the observers-in this case the viewers-into the mind set of the new guy-and the communiity in which s/he is found.  Put a South Asian in South Wales and it is going to take awhile to get it-but get it one does and it is wonderful.  Doc Martin moved to Cornwall and we all got used to it.  The Indian Doctor is as good and the magnificent Welsh scenery is better-and more realistic.  (The sun never once stopped shining in COrnwall in the DOc Martin series-at least there is a cloud or two coming in over the soon to be disused coal mines.)
