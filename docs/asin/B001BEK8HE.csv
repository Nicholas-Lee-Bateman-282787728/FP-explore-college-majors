1171990,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B001BEK8HE,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[8, 9]","I'm a fan of Bill Engvall, one of the nicest, most family-friendly of the 'blue-collar' comedians, and ""Bait Shop"" plays to his strengths, as the debt-ridden but easy-going owner of a run-down bait shop frequented by an array of likable oddballs. With the bank calling in his mortgage, he is about to lose everything, and resign himself to a menial job with his smarmy, successful father-in-law, 'The Mattress King' (Harve Presnell)...but the Bass Masters Professional Fishing Tournament is in town, with a $50,000 prize, and a rules loophole that allows him (an amateur and past champion) to compete...against the world's greatest angler, egotistical Hot Rod Johnson (Billy Ray Cyrus). Can Engvall, with his rusty boat, ancient equipment, and long-latent fishing instincts, defeat state-of-the-art, high-powered 21st century technology? Do you have any doubt?This isn't 'classic' comedy in any sense, but it never falls into the rut of 'toilet humor' (a frequent problem of the films of Engvall's peers), and it does promote positive family values, which is a happy 'plus'. Engvall is a 'natural', on camera, possessing the same kind of screen 'likability' as Tim Allen, and he and Cyrus play off each other surprisingly well.""Bait Shop"" isn't a 'must-have' kind of film, but makes a pretty good 'family movie night' entry!",3,"Innocuous, Family-Friendly Comedy...",1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,1324,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'one', 'nicest', 'most', 'family-friendly', ""'blue-collar"", 'comedians', 'Bait', 'Shop', 'strengths', 'debt-ridden', 'easy-going', 'owner', 'run-down', 'bait', 'shop', 'frequented', 'array', 'likable', 'oddballs', 'bank', 'calling', 'mortgage', 'lose', 'everything', 'resign', 'menial', 'job', 'smarmy', 'successful', 'father-in-law', 'Mattress', 'King', 'Harve', 'Presnell', 'Bass', 'Masters', 'Professional', 'Fishing', 'Tournament', 'town', '50,000', 'prize', 'rules', 'loophole', 'amateur', 'past', 'champion', 'compete', 'world', 'greatest', 'angler', 'egotistical', 'Hot', 'Rod', 'Johnson', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'Cyrus', 'Can', 'Engvall', 'rusty', 'boat', 'ancient', 'equipment', 'long-latent', 'fishing', 'instincts', 'defeat', 'state-of-the-art', 'high-powered', '21st', 'century', 'technology', 'Do', 'have', 'doubt', ""n't"", ""'classic"", 'comedy', 'sense', 'never', 'rut', ""'toilet"", 'humor', 'frequent', 'problem', 'films', 'Engvall', 'peers', 'promote', 'positive', 'family', 'values', 'happy', ""'plus"", 'Engvall', ""'natural"", ""'"", 'camera', 'possessing', 'same', 'kind', 'screen', ""'likability"", 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Cyrus', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'Bait', 'Shop', ""n't"", ""'must-have"", 'kind', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', ""'family"", 'movie', 'night', 'entry']",Bait Shop

I had just recently watched a comedy movie with him called ""Delta Farce"", that was a fun way to spend an afternoon in front of the tube. This movie is about Bill, the owner of an old bait shop at a big bass lake, who has a balloon payment coming up on the shop's mortgage. He has a collection of friends that hang out daily, some of whom are freeloaders, and the shop is not doing well. Things are bad enough before a nationally famous fisherman named ""Hot Rod Johnson"" comes to town. Billy Ray Cyrus as Hot Rod as a character is mean, arrogant, a braggart and a bully. Bill decides to enter the big bass tournament to save his shop, while even his own son seems enamored with the fishing superstar. Good supporting cast.

The only difference is the swearing and the beer.  Ultimately, I think this was simply a starring vehicle for stand-up comedian Bill Engvall (there's a reference to his popular bit ""Here's Your Sign"" right at the beginning), and I'm just fine with that.  I've always been a big Bill Engvall fan and this film just embraces that ""Simple Man"" persona that this funny man has always brought to the stage.  If you're a Bill Engvall fan like me, you should very well add this to your collection.  Heck, even Bill Ray Sirus was watchable, though I enjoyed the two commentaters during the fishing competition more...and you don't wanna miss the film's characters' consideration to give Mr. Sirus the deeath penalty.

1172000,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B001BEK8HE,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 2]","""Bait Shop"" is a predictable, often corny, family-approved blue collar comedy revolving around a bass fishing tournament. Conceived and written by the amiable Bill Engvall, the film opens with down-on-his-luck bait shop owner Bill Dugan (Engvall, in a role that's not much of a stretch for him) and his band of crazed friends hanging out at the shop dwelling on poor Bill's bad luck, lack of business prowess, and personal problems with his overbearing father-in-law, Jack (veteran character actor Harve Presnell, ""The Mattress King"") who wants him to close the shop and enjoys berating him for his personal failures. Add to this his disinterested teen son Scott (Vincent Martella,) who is entitled and lazy, and poor Bill has his hands full. When he gets the letter from the bank giving him a week to come up with a $15,000 balloon payment on the shop, the future looks bleak.The one person with a seemingly fabulous future is Hot Rod Johnson (Billy Ray Cyrus, in a role he described as his personally most challenging...really; watch the extras,) the number one bass fisherman in the world. Hot Rod is all flash but is incredibly shallow, arrogant, and egotistical. He also wears sequined fishing jumpsuits; his motto: ""Fishing is war!"" It is clear that the plot is going to turn this into another in a long string of character-driven underdog versus big shot movies, the only questions are what will be Hot Rod's undoing and how long will it take? For those looking for foreshadowing, please examine the somewhat ludicrous subplot about Scott (a teen with zero prior interest in fishing) being lured (if you'll pardon the pun) by Hot Rod's personal magnetism. It seems somewhat (OK, totally) unbelievable that Scott would become one of Hot Rod's minions, but that's how it unfolds, much to the consternation of Bill and his longsuffering wife Laura (Mary Rachel Dudley.) Could it be that this seemingly ludicrous plotpoint will be Hot Rod's undoing? I won't tell.Interspersed with bouts of physical comedy (Bill in a bass suit, Bill's boat sinking, Bill falling out of the boat, Bill wrestling with a fish, etc.) the film focuses on the entire cast (minus Hot Rod, of course) learning that family and friends are more important than winning or success in the eyes of outsiders. The plot comes down to weighing the fish at the end of the tournament, and you get no points for guessing who wins and who gets banned from bass fishing for life for cheating, an event summarized by the question ""Is there a death penalty in bass fishing?""The film has a bit of added credibility due to the official participation of ESPN, who sent real fishing commentators Mark Zona and Keith Alan to do the moderating; it's an effort that pays off and does add to the film's visual experience. There is much to roll your eyes at here too, of course: all the characters are caricatures that are tailor made for an extended Engvall routine, and much of the dialogue is beyond corny (""I am not a freak! I'm a bass!"") but while the film definitely breaks no comedic ground I am giving it three stars for its palatability for families (there is no objectionable material or language in the film) and the fact that it does in its own way make a moral stand for fair play and against arrogance and cheating. The extras are brief and are forgettable, with ""Opening the Bait Shop"" the best of the bunch and the gag reel the worst of the lot. If you like Bill Engvall, Billy Ray Cyrus, or fishing and want to see a comedy that is not especially nuanced but that has a positive underlying message, ""Bait Shop"" is a film for you.",3,Bill Engvall And Billy Ray Cyrus: The Martin And Lewis Of Bass Fishing?,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,3599,"['Bait', 'Shop', 'predictable', 'often', 'corny', 'family-approved', 'blue', 'collar', 'comedy', 'revolving', 'bass', 'fishing', 'tournament', 'Conceived', 'written', 'amiable', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'film', 'down-on-his-luck', 'bait', 'shop', 'owner', 'Bill', 'Dugan', 'Engvall', 'role', 'not', 'much', 'stretch', 'band', 'crazed', 'friends', 'hanging', 'out', 'shop', 'dwelling', 'poor', 'Bill', 'bad', 'luck', 'lack', 'business', 'prowess', 'personal', 'problems', 'overbearing', 'father-in-law', 'Jack', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Harve', 'Presnell', 'Mattress', 'King', 'who', 'close', 'shop', 'berating', 'personal', 'failures', 'Add', 'disinterested', 'teen', 'son', 'Scott', 'Vincent', 'Martella', 'who', 'entitled', 'lazy', 'poor', 'Bill', 'hands', 'full', 'When', 'letter', 'bank', 'giving', 'week', 'come', 'up', '15,000', 'balloon', 'payment', 'shop', 'future', 'one', 'person', 'seemingly', 'fabulous', 'future', 'Hot', 'Rod', 'Johnson', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'Cyrus', 'role', 'described', 'personally', 'most', 'challenging', 'really', 'watch', 'extras', 'number', 'one', 'bass', 'fisherman', 'world', 'Hot', 'Rod', 'flash', 'incredibly', 'shallow', 'arrogant', 'egotistical', 'also', 'sequined', 'fishing', 'jumpsuits', 'motto', 'Fishing', 'war', 'clear', 'plot', 'going', 'turn', 'long', 'string', 'character-driven', 'underdog', 'versus', 'big', 'shot', 'movies', 'only', 'questions', 'are', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'Hot', 'Rod', 'undoing', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'take', 'looking', 'foreshadowing', 'please', 'examine', 'somewhat', 'ludicrous', 'subplot', 'Scott', 'teen', 'zero', 'prior', 'interest', 'fishing', 'being', 'lured', ""'ll"", 'pardon', 'pun', 'Hot', 'Rod', 'personal', 'magnetism', 'somewhat', 'OK', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'Scott', 'would', 'become', 'one', 'Hot', 'Rod', 'minions', 'how', 'much', 'consternation', 'Bill', 'longsuffering', 'wife', 'Laura', 'Mary', 'Rachel', 'Dudley', 'Could', 'be', 'seemingly', 'ludicrous', 'plotpoint', 'will', 'be', 'Hot', 'Rod', 'undoing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell.Interspersed', 'bouts', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Bill', 'bass', 'suit', 'Bill', 'boat', 'sinking', 'Bill', 'falling', 'boat', 'Bill', 'wrestling', 'fish', 'etc', 'film', 'entire', 'cast', 'Hot', 'Rod', 'course', 'learning', 'family', 'friends', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'winning', 'success', 'eyes', 'outsiders', 'plot', 'down', 'weighing', 'fish', 'end', 'tournament', 'get', 'points', 'guessing', 'who', 'wins', 'who', 'banned', 'bass', 'fishing', 'life', 'cheating', 'event', 'summarized', 'question', 'death', 'penalty', 'bass', 'fishing', 'film', 'bit', 'added', 'credibility', 'due', 'official', 'participation', 'ESPN', 'who', 'sent', 'real', 'fishing', 'commentators', 'Mark', 'Zona', 'Keith', 'Alan', 'do', 'moderating', 'effort', 'off', 'add', 'film', 'visual', 'experience', 'much', 'roll', 'eyes', 'here', 'too', 'course', 'characters', 'are', 'caricatures', 'are', 'tailor', 'made', 'extended', 'Engvall', 'routine', 'much', 'dialogue', 'corny', 'am', 'not', 'freak', ""'m"", 'bass', 'film', 'definitely', 'comedic', 'ground', 'am', 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'palatability', 'families', 'objectionable', 'material', 'language', 'film', 'fact', 'own', 'way', 'make', 'moral', 'stand', 'fair', 'play', 'arrogance', 'cheating', 'extras', 'are', 'brief', 'are', 'forgettable', 'Opening', 'Bait', 'Shop', 'best', 'bunch', 'gag', 'reel', 'worst', 'lot', 'like', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'Cyrus', 'fishing', 'want', 'see', 'comedy', 'not', 'especially', 'nuanced', 'positive', 'underlying', 'message', 'Bait', 'Shop', 'film']",Bait Shop
