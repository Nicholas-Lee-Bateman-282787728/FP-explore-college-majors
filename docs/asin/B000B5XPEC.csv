Now she is of value to some people and a threat to others. How is she going to get out of this pickle?A well executed formula movie. At one time we were innovated by movies where a secret formula, or radiation, or LSD experiments create a superset of senses. And of course the experiment hast to be covered up. The main experimentee is usually more moral than the experimenter. Others, usually the government, want to use the abilities for their own nefarious purposes.So the story is not unique however the acting and details are exceptionally good. You can tell that this is a pilot and it makes you wonder who will survive to make the program.For sci-fi lovers you may recognize George Takei (Sulu on Star Trek), and John de Lancie (Q on Star Trek: Voyager), together again.The only thing missing would be the mystique of a missing film maker.

The story was very original and entertaining.  It made me want to research the incident that it is suposed to have been based on.  This movie would have been a block buster if it would have had Julia Roberts or Nicole Kidman playing the part of patient 14.  The comentary on the DVD mentioned that it was developed to be a pilot for a TV series and I  certinly would be interested in seeing stories developed using Liza's  talents.",5,A sleeper movie that I really liked,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,512,"['bought', 'movie', 'used', 'buck', 'did', 'ever', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'original', 'entertaining', 'made', 'want', 'research', 'incident', 'suposed', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'block', 'buster', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'playing', 'part', 'patient', '14', 'comentary', 'DVD', 'mentioned', 'was', 'developed', 'be', 'pilot', 'TV', 'series', 'certinly', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'stories', 'developed', 'using', 'Liza', 'talents']",Eavesdropper
936295,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000B5XPEC,Dorrie Wheeler,"[6, 6]","Eavesdropper is an absolutely fascinating movie. The film's DVD box claims that the movie is based on ""shocking true events."" Knowing this information makes the film appealing. However after digging under the surface a little its not clear exactly what is true and what isn't. The films website claims the films director Andrew Bakalar was kidnapped upon completing the film. It seems like the whole based on a true story and the film maker missing claim was created to bolster interest in the film. However, this hoopla, whether true or false was not needed. Eavesdropper is the story of a woman who survived a horrible robbery that left her husband dead and her deaf. The incident leaves her broken down mentally and financially and she finds herself living in a shelter. At the shelter she decides to participate in an experiment to re-store her hearing. She knows it's a government experiment with unproven results but she is desperate to restore her hearing. Her hearing returns immediately after the surgery. Soon after that she starts hearing voices in her head. The voices she is hearing are not her own. She is hearing other peoples thoughts-the good, the bad and the things people don't want you to hear. The other patients who were a part of the experiment are dying or driven to suicide. When she tries to escape the program her life is endangered.Eavesdropper is an interested film compromised mostly of a C list cast, but its definitely worth checking out.",4,Really Good Movie,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,1470,"['Eavesdropper', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'film', 'DVD', 'box', 'claims', 'movie', 'based', 'shocking', 'true', 'events', 'Knowing', 'information', 'film', 'appealing', 'However', 'digging', 'surface', 'little', 'not', 'clear', 'exactly', 'what', 'true', 'what', ""n't"", 'films', 'claims', 'films', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Bakalar', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'completing', 'film', 'whole', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'maker', 'missing', 'claim', 'was', 'created', 'bolster', 'interest', 'film', 'However', 'hoopla', 'true', 'false', 'was', 'not', 'needed', 'Eavesdropper', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'survived', 'horrible', 'robbery', 'left', 'husband', 'dead', 'deaf', 'incident', 'broken', 'down', 'mentally', 'financially', 'living', 'shelter', 'shelter', 'participate', 'experiment', 're-store', 'hearing', 'government', 'experiment', 'unproven', 'results', 'desperate', 'restore', 'hearing', 'hearing', 'returns', 'immediately', 'surgery', 'Soon', 'hearing', 'voices', 'head', 'voices', 'hearing', 'are', 'not', 'own', 'hearing', 'other', 'peoples', 'thoughts-the', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'other', 'patients', 'who', 'were', 'part', 'experiment', 'are', 'dying', 'driven', 'suicide', 'When', 'escape', 'program', 'life', 'endangered.Eavesdropper', 'interested', 'film', 'compromised', 'mostly', 'C', 'list', 'cast', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",Eavesdropper

I was mesmerized by the fact that hearing could be so acute as to hear the electric activity of brain cells. The idea that this was real and not a made up story, made it more exciting to me. I can understand why the goverment wanted to use this person to fight against terrorism or in interviews with serial killers, as they said the enemy would never know that their thoughts were heard. This is still almost unbelievable that this could happen. As the saying goes truth is stranger than fiction. I have recomended this DVD to several people.
