Joe with science fiction and anime-flavorings, Exo-Squad focused on a group of futuristic soldiers led by J.T. Marsh, whose weapons of choice happen to be battle-heavy exo-suits.  As said before in previous reviews, the series as a whole didn't really feature stand-alone episodes, but worked as an overarching season arc instead, in which our heroes battle the powerful and genetically engineered Neo-Sapiens.  This collection features all 13 first season episodes, and while watching Exo-Squad now finds the series hasn't aged all that well (particularly the animation), the series is still notable for some striking mature themes and an ever-compelling storyarc and characters you actually end up caring about.

1222449,AHF97M45JFCB,B001OD8E2I,ONENEO,"[61, 62]","Sixteen years is a long time.  Children born during Exosquad's broadcast on USA network are now old enough to drive, quit school, and get married (parent signature required in most states).  But I digress, to those of us who have waited patiently for all these long years; Universal Studios Home Entertainment's announcement that Exosquad is coming to DVD is prime proof of the phrase ""better late than never"".Exosquad - Season 1 is the first of two seasons from the animated USA Network series that debuted in 1993 and will be followed by three more 2-disc sets totaling 52 episodes.The show, for those who don't know, is considered by many to be the closest domestic attempt at Japanese anime to date.  ExoSquad's creative staff weaved an ongoing tale centering on a single combat unit (the ExoSquad) and their exploits in a cosmic war raging between human beings and our own rebellious genetic creations, Neo-Sapiens.  The setting spans the rocky planets of our solar system (Venus, Earth, Mars) with occasional visits to the asteroid-laden rings of gas-giant Saturn.Like most anime entries, the 52-episode saga does not consist of 52 individual episodes but rather 52 parts of a single tale.  Episodes typically end very abruptly and pick up in the next episode exactly where the previous one left off.  Additionally the show doesn't candy-coat concepts such as death or betrayal.  Like real wars, there are casualties and the team you happen to be rooting for doesn't always come out on top.  Finally the use of mecha (in this case they are called E-Frames or ExoFrames) takes another chapter from the typically considered Japanese area of expertise.Previously released across several VHS tapes, this set collects the first 13 episodes together in one package for the first time. Episodes will be presented in full frame video, with English Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo audio and English subtitles.Here are the episodes contained:1 Pirate Scourge2 Seeds of Deception3 Hidden Terrors4 Blitzkrieg5 Resist!6 Target: Earth7 A Traitor Among Us8 Scorched Venus9 Sabotage10 Abandoned11 The Brood12 Betrayal13 Defying Olympus",5,Finally- Exosquad Gets the DVD treatment it deserves,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,2118,"['Sixteen', 'years', 'long', 'time', 'Children', 'Exosquad', 'broadcast', 'USA', 'network', 'are', 'now', 'old', 'enough', 'drive', 'quit', 'school', 'get', 'married', 'parent', 'signature', 'required', 'most', 'states', 'digress', 'who', 'have', 'waited', 'patiently', 'long', 'years', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'announcement', 'Exosquad', 'coming', 'DVD', 'prime', 'proof', 'phrase', 'better', 'late', 'never', '.Exosquad', 'Season', '1', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'animated', 'USA', 'Network', 'series', 'debuted', '1993', 'will', 'be', 'followed', 'three', 'more', '2-disc', 'sets', 'totaling', '52', 'episodes.The', 'show', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'closest', 'domestic', 'attempt', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'date', 'ExoSquad', 'creative', 'staff', 'weaved', 'ongoing', 'tale', 'centering', 'single', 'combat', 'unit', 'ExoSquad', 'exploits', 'cosmic', 'war', 'raging', 'human', 'beings', 'own', 'rebellious', 'genetic', 'creations', 'Neo-Sapiens', 'setting', 'rocky', 'planets', 'solar', 'system', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'occasional', 'visits', 'asteroid-laden', 'rings', 'gas-giant', 'Saturn.Like', 'most', 'anime', 'entries', '52-episode', 'saga', 'not', 'consist', '52', 'individual', 'episodes', 'rather', '52', 'parts', 'single', 'tale', 'Episodes', 'typically', 'end', 'very', 'abruptly', 'pick', 'up', 'next', 'episode', 'exactly', 'where', 'previous', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'Additionally', 'show', ""n't"", 'candy-coat', 'concepts', 'such', 'death', 'betrayal', 'real', 'wars', 'are', 'casualties', 'team', 'happen', 'be', 'rooting', ""n't"", 'always', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'Finally', 'use', 'mecha', 'case', 'are', 'called', 'E-Frames', 'ExoFrames', 'chapter', 'typically', 'considered', 'Japanese', 'area', 'expertise.Previously', 'released', 'several', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'set', 'first', '13', 'episodes', 'together', 'one', 'package', 'first', 'time', 'Episodes', 'will', 'be', 'presented', 'full', 'frame', 'video', 'English', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'Stereo', 'audio', 'English', 'are', 'episodes', 'contained:1', 'Pirate', 'Scourge2', 'Seeds', 'Deception3', 'Hidden', 'Terrors4', 'Blitzkrieg5', 'Resist', '6', 'Target', 'Earth7', 'Traitor', 'Us8', 'Scorched', 'Venus9', 'Sabotage10', 'Abandoned11', 'Brood12', 'Betrayal13', 'Defying', 'Olympus']",Exosquad: Season 1
