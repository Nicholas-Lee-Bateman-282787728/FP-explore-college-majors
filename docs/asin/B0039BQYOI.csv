But after reading a few good reviews, I decided it was time to correct that oversight.  And after viewing the film for the first time, I'm prepared to call ""She Devil"" a minor classic.  There are other reviews that give you the details of the plot, but I think this is one that's best enjoyed with very little foreknowledge.  Suffice it to say that if you like low-budget films that somehow succeed on creativity and raw nerve (not to mention a quite committed performance from the leading lady), you'll probably have a good time with this one.Like other recent genre releases from Olive Films such asInvasion of the Body Snatchersand the oft-overlookedThe Space Children, the transfer on this one is top-notch.  I viewed the anamorphic widescreen DVD on my Blu-ray player connected to a 60"" plasma screen, and was very satisfied with the results. Unfortunately, there are no extras at all, just some generic chapter stops.  But if you're a fan of the film, my guess is that you'll be delighted to have such a fine copy for your collection.  And if, like me, you're just discovering She Devil, you will probably appreciate that such apparent care has been taken in offering this top-notch presentation of the film.",4,Terrific transfer of a pretty solid b-movie,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,1306,"['much', 'love', '50', 'sci-fi', 'monster', 'movies', 'one', 'somehow', 'eluded', 'years', 'reading', 'few', 'good', 'reviews', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'correct', 'oversight', 'viewing', 'film', 'first', 'time', ""'m"", 'prepared', 'call', 'Devil', 'minor', 'classic', 'are', 'other', 'reviews', 'give', 'details', 'plot', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'little', 'foreknowledge', 'Suffice', 'say', 'like', 'low-budget', 'films', 'somehow', 'succeed', 'creativity', 'raw', 'nerve', 'not', 'mention', 'quite', 'committed', 'performance', 'leading', 'lady', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'one.Like', 'other', 'recent', 'genre', 'releases', 'Olive', 'Films', 'such', 'asInvasion', 'Body', 'Snatchersand', 'oft-overlookedThe', 'Space', 'Children', 'transfer', 'one', 'top-notch', 'viewed', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'connected', '60', 'plasma', 'screen', 'was', 'very', 'satisfied', 'results', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'extras', 'just', 'generic', 'chapter', 'stops', ""'re"", 'fan', 'film', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'be', 'delighted', 'have', 'fine', 'copy', 'collection', ""'re"", 'just', 'discovering', 'Devil', 'will', 'probably', 'appreciate', 'such', 'apparent', 'care', 'been', 'taken', 'offering', 'top-notch', 'presentation', 'film']",She Devil (1957)

With it they cure a moribund tuberculosis victim.  Once she is well her personality completely changes.  She is out for herself and doesn't care who she mows down in her selfish quests.  Her hair changes from brunette to platinum blonde on its own and changes back when she commits mayhem.  The doctors spend the bulk of the film trying to stop this Frankenstein monster they inadvertently created.  The DVD from Olive Films has no extras but is in excellent condition.

The film is totally horrible as was the television script it was based on but I will never forget seeing it at the Town theater in downtown Miami.  It was a little theater sandwiched in between the Paramount and some gift shop and a Sloppy Joes, orange and sandwich stand.  I loved the movie and even though it has been almost 55+ maybe more years since I saw it, I will never forget it.  I totally loved this sci-fi/trashy film and my eyes didn't droop once.  I was just so fascinated by the plot, the bosoms on Ms. Blanchard and the fair performances.  No special effects.  This all relied on telling a story and suspending any disbelief you might have.  I remember every moment to this day, especially that moment when Ms. Blanchard is trying to steal something out of a dress shop and she's in the dressing room and looks down at the sink with this ""what am I gonna do, what am I doing here, why did I do what I just do"" and suddenly she looks up at herself and she's no longer the mousy brunette but a spectacular blonde with a suddenly not so innocent look on her face.  Honestly, this film is a blast and a keeper, especially if you are stuck in your house on a rainy day or have encephalitis or menengitis or something that's keeping you in bed.  It'll take your mind off of it as you all of a sudden realize that not all good stuff is entertaining.  If Ms. Blanchard could have a half way descent career off of crap like this and I can remember what a knockout she was, then I think that speaks volumes.  Go ahead.

1333820,AROVSENHMWEXO,B0039BQYOI,orvuus,"[4, 4]","This review is for the blu ray from Olive Films.  The image quality is superb, as is the audio.  There are no extras and no subtitles.  I would like to deduct a point for no subtitles alone on all Olive Films (and Warner), but this bizarre flick from the fifties is truly a B-movie masterpiece.  Mari Blanchard shines in her role as a woman reanimated from certain death with an experimental drug, which has the side effect of making her ruthlessly independent, self-seeking, and death-proof!  Albert Dekker, always entertaining, has to struggle with some truly awkward scriptwriting, but the combined talents of just about all the actors in the film make it entertaining enough.  You could take the entire film allegorically, as being anything from a glimpse into the horrors of women stepping outside their established, stereotyped roles, to a criticism of the hypocrisy of men, as the anti-heroine wraps them around her little finger.  Or better yet, just enjoy this film for what it is (even if a bit overpriced for just the film alone), and be sure to spot all the medical/science errors!  The doctors take great delight in traipsing about a T.B. patient's room without masks, and the lung x-rays look surprisingly clear of disease all around, to name just two.",4,The real monster from the Fifties -- the liberated woman!,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,1266,"['review', 'blu', 'ray', 'Olive', 'Films', 'image', 'quality', 'superb', 'audio', 'are', 'extras', 'subtitles', 'would', 'like', 'deduct', 'point', 'subtitles', 'alone', 'Olive', 'Films', 'Warner', 'bizarre', 'flick', 'fifties', 'truly', 'B-movie', 'masterpiece', 'Mari', 'Blanchard', 'shines', 'role', 'woman', 'reanimated', 'certain', 'death', 'experimental', 'drug', 'side', 'effect', 'making', 'ruthlessly', 'independent', 'self-seeking', 'death-proof', 'Albert', 'Dekker', 'always', 'entertaining', 'struggle', 'truly', 'awkward', 'scriptwriting', 'combined', 'talents', 'just', 'actors', 'film', 'make', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'could', 'take', 'entire', 'film', 'allegorically', 'being', 'anything', 'glimpse', 'horrors', 'women', 'stepping', 'established', 'stereotyped', 'roles', 'criticism', 'hypocrisy', 'men', 'anti-heroine', 'wraps', 'around', 'little', 'finger', 'better', 'yet', 'just', 'enjoy', 'film', 'what', 'even', 'bit', 'overpriced', 'just', 'film', 'alone', 'be', 'sure', 'spot', 'medical/science', 'errors', 'doctors', 'take', 'great', 'delight', 'traipsing', 'T.B', 'patient', 'room', 'masks', 'lung', 'x-rays', 'look', 'surprisingly', 'clear', 'disease', 'around', 'name', 'just', 'two']",She Devil (1957)

But when I ordered this crisp new DVD release, I wondered if it would hold up after all these decades.No need to worry! It's still as enjoyable as ever, with the additional bonus of being faithful to the classic sci-fi short story on which it's based, Stanley Weinbaum's ""The Adaptive Ultimate"" -- and how often does that happen? It may be modest in scope & budget, but it makes the most of what it's got -- and what it's got the most of is Mari Blanchard, playing the happily amoral Kyra Zelas with trampy zest. Just watch her sashay up those steps after confronting the drab, boring, but filthy rich couple in the garden. Clearly she was having a wonderful time with the role, and she just eats up the screen.And as I watched the film again, I realized that I was still rooting for her to succeed, even though she's supposedly the monster of the story. One of the doctors refers to her as a goddess at one point, and he's not far wrong -- she's a bolt of lightning in the drab, male-dominated world of the 1950s -- and of course the gods aren't held to the same standards as mere mortals. Yes, she's got men stopping in their tracks to follow her anywhere, but they're all too willing to go along. I love the old housekeeper's sour glances at young, besotted Dr. Scott -- you can tell she's thinking, ""You big dumb sap!""In the end, of course, she has to be punished for asserting herself. The only difference between her & the gaggle of rich men she meets is that she doesn't put on the facade of respectability. She may go after what she wants, but she's open & honest about it. And she never really seems truly evil -- after all, she's just trying to survive in an alien (i.e., men's) world. Oh, she's a bad girl, and no mistake ... but you can't help liking her.A minor film, certainly no masterpiece -- but it's great entertainment -- highly recommended!",4,Solid B-movie that delivers beyond its meager budget,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,2024,"['previous', 'reviewers', 'recall', 'movie', 'TV', 'reruns', 'boyhood', 'having', 'been', 'boy', 'just', 'right', 'age', 'then', 'especially', 'recall', 'Mari', 'Blanchard', 'when', 'ordered', 'crisp', 'new', 'DVD', 'release', 'wondered', 'would', 'hold', 'up', 'decades.No', 'need', 'worry', 'still', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'ever', 'additional', 'bonus', 'being', 'faithful', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'short', 'story', 'based', 'Stanley', 'Weinbaum', 'Adaptive', 'Ultimate', 'how', 'often', 'happen', 'may', 'be', 'modest', 'scope', 'budget', 'most', 'what', 'got', 'what', 'got', 'most', 'Mari', 'Blanchard', 'playing', 'happily', 'amoral', 'Kyra', 'Zelas', 'trampy', 'zest', 'Just', 'watch', 'sashay', 'up', 'steps', 'confronting', 'drab', 'boring', 'filthy', 'rich', 'couple', 'garden', 'Clearly', 'was', 'having', 'wonderful', 'time', 'role', 'just', 'up', 'screen.And', 'watched', 'film', 'again', 'realized', 'was', 'still', 'rooting', 'succeed', 'even', 'supposedly', 'monster', 'story', 'One', 'doctors', 'refers', 'goddess', 'one', 'point', 'not', 'far', 'wrong', 'bolt', 'lightning', 'drab', 'male-dominated', 'world', '1950s', 'course', 'gods', 'are', ""n't"", 'held', 'same', 'standards', 'mere', 'mortals', 'Yes', 'got', 'men', 'stopping', 'tracks', 'follow', 'anywhere', ""'re"", 'too', 'willing', 'go', 'along', 'love', 'old', 'housekeeper', 'sour', 'glances', 'young', 'besotted', 'Dr.', 'Scott', 'can', 'tell', 'thinking', 'big', 'dumb', 'sap', 'end', 'course', 'be', 'punished', 'asserting', 'only', 'difference', 'gaggle', 'rich', 'men', ""n't"", 'put', 'facade', 'respectability', 'may', 'go', 'what', 'open', 'honest', 'never', 'really', 'truly', 'evil', 'just', 'trying', 'survive', 'alien', 'i.e.', 'men', 'world', 'Oh', 'bad', 'girl', 'mistake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'liking', 'her.A', 'minor', 'film', 'certainly', 'masterpiece', 'great', 'entertainment', 'highly', 'recommended']",She Devil (1957)
