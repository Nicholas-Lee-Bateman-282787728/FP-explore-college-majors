He will never perform like that again!  This one doesn't come close, but hey, sometimes concert performances are rare and you have to settle for anything.As usual, he has the audience revved up and interactive.  The man is a true performer.  But, for ""I Am I Said"", that passionate, lonesome feeling he is able to emote just doesn't come through on this show.  ""Headed For the Future"" shows the music video he did for this song.Filmed live at the Aquarius Theatre in Los Angeles in 1988 and it is punctuated by his 80s music with the few 70s classics included the fun ""Forever in Blue Jeans.""  He also offers a tribute song to John Lennon.Linda Press, the sole female in the band joins him for millionth time for ""You Don't Bring Me Flowers.""  Neil, give that poor girl another song too sing!  She has been doing this song and only this song at your concerts for years, even today!!!So, enjoy an o.k. performance, but for a magical experience get ""Love at the Greek.""  .....MzRizz",4,Not his best!

Filmed before a small audience at the Aquarius Theatre in Los Angeles in 1988 it appears that Diamond was just going through the motions.The performance, while it does include some of his best work, seems oddly disconnected and lifeless. The mix is adequate but nothing special. There are times when the camera cuts to a member of the band and you can't really hear the instrument he is playing.I have seen Mr. Diamond twice before and I know that there are better performances out there. The song selection could have been boosted to add some more of the classics.All in all you need to take what you can get but this DVD is disappointing.",2,Bit of A Disappointment,1195257600,"11 17, 2007",2007,752,"['Unfortunately', 'not', 'lot', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'available', 'video', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'Live', 'rather', 'hit', 'miss', 'Filmed', 'small', 'audience', 'Aquarius', 'Theatre', 'Los', 'Angeles', '1988', 'Diamond', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'motions.The', 'performance', 'include', 'best', 'work', 'oddly', 'disconnected', 'lifeless', 'mix', 'adequate', 'nothing', 'special', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'camera', 'member', 'band', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'hear', 'instrument', 'playing.I', 'have', 'seen', 'Mr.', 'Diamond', 'twice', 'before', 'know', 'are', 'better', 'performances', 'out', 'there', 'song', 'selection', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'boosted', 'add', 'more', 'classics.All', 'need', 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'DVD', 'disappointing']",Neil Diamond - Greatest Hits Live

The problem is it defaults to PCM. So go to the main menu and select the audio button and you  will see the 5.1. I also recommend increasing the center channel volume  about 4db.

The performance was okay and pretty much what I expected but I guess I must have evolved out of liking this sort of music.  It is music; most of what comes out of the pop world today really can't be called music. Diamond performed professionally and sang well enough especially when compared to what the pop world churns out today.  The thrill of live performance was there in spades and that made it worth watching but it's not something I'll watch very often.,3,Neil Diamond,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,498,"['was', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'performance', 'was', 'okay', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'expected', 'guess', 'must', 'have', 'evolved', 'liking', 'sort', 'music', 'music', 'most', 'what', 'pop', 'world', 'today', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'called', 'music', 'Diamond', 'performed', 'professionally', 'sang', 'well', 'enough', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'what', 'pop', 'world', 'out', 'today', 'thrill', 'live', 'performance', 'was', 'there', 'spades', 'made', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'something', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'very', 'often']",Neil Diamond - Greatest Hits Live
