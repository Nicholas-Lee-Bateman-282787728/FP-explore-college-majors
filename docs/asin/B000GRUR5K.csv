1006748,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000GRUR5K,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","Imagine joining a dozen other people inside a cramped 1956 van for a 600-mile trek across Argentina just to attend a wedding.  It's the middle of summer, and there's no air conditioning.  Any volunteers?  Now imagine that all your fellow travelers are - Egad! - your family.  Yes, Rolling Family (Familia Rodante) presents the nightmare scenario of one such journey, from Buenos Aires to Misiones (on the Argentina-Brazil border).  You can just imagine all of the humor and drama sure to arise from such conditions.  It's a long, hard trip for an old 1956 Chevy Viking camper, but mechanical problems are the least of this family's worries, as the trip takes both a physical and an emotional toll on all involved.So who do we have here?  We must start with Emilia (Graciana Chironi), the matriarch of the family.  It was her idea for the whole family to travel with her to Misiones for the marriage of her niece.  From her position as the very heart of both the family and the film itself, Emilia's endurance is pushed to the limits by the heat, cramped conditions, and general behavior of family members she can criticize but never control.  Sisters Claudia and Marta are married to Oscar (or ""Fatso"") and Ernesto, respectively - but that doesn't keep Ernesto from putting the moves on Marta (and you know no good can come from that).  A further generation down, you have Paula, who's brought her baby along after another row with her boyfriend (and that certainly makes for a volatile situation when said boyfriend shows up).  There's also Yanina, who has the hots for her cousin Gustavo, who in turn prefers the friend Yanina brought along on the trip with her (although he's not averse to messing around with his cousin, as well).  Young Matias is actually the sanest and most civil one of the whole lot - all he does is sneak a dog along for the ride.Much is made of Graciana Chironi's performance as Emilia - and rightfully so, as she's wonderfully real and human in the role.  What makes her performance particularly impressive is the fact that she had never acted professionally before - although she did have quite a rapport with the director.  She is in fact director Pablo Trapero's very own grandmother.  And that's not the only thing that makes this a story particularly close to Trapero's heart.  The whole thing was inspired by his own childhood memories of family camping trips - trips that were made in the very same van used in the filming of this movie.Rolling Family is really an unabashed look at the interdynamics of family life.  Feelings and emotions that might have festered beneath the surface for years explode under the pressure of these mucho caliente conditions.  It's hot, it's loud, it's basically just crazy.  I can't say I found the film all that heartwarming, though - real, yes, but heartwarming, not so much (there's certainly nothing in the way of a fairy tale ending to be found here).  This has a lot to do with the ending, which is an ending rather than a conclusion.  The lack of cloture sort of bothered me initially, but I'm coming around to the idea that it's really a fitting way to end things.  After all, there's no cloture in life itself; there's never a moment when we know for sure what has gone down in our lives, and there's certainly no point in which something worrisome doesn't loom somewhere in the future.This was my first Argentinean film (and I should point out that the DVD does have English subtitles).  Besides reminding me that I've forgotten everything I ever used to know about Spanish, the film served up a wonderful, albeit limited, introduction to the Argentinean countryside and, to some extent, the people.  One scene in particular puzzled me, but I'm sure that is due to my relative ignorance of the cultural aspects of Argentina.  There's no trouble understanding what this film is really about, though, as family is family wherever you are and whatever language you speak.",5,"An entertaining, illuminating look at family life across four generations",1161648000,"10 24, 2006",2006,3946,"['Imagine', 'joining', 'dozen', 'other', 'people', 'cramped', '1956', 'van', '600-mile', 'trek', 'Argentina', 'just', 'attend', 'wedding', 'middle', 'summer', 'air', 'conditioning', 'volunteers', 'Now', 'imagine', 'fellow', 'travelers', 'are', 'Egad', 'family', 'Yes', 'Rolling', 'Family', 'Familia', 'Rodante', 'nightmare', 'scenario', 'one', 'such', 'journey', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'Misiones', 'Argentina-Brazil', 'border', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'humor', 'drama', 'sure', 'arise', 'such', 'conditions', 'long', 'hard', 'trip', 'old', '1956', 'Chevy', 'Viking', 'camper', 'mechanical', 'problems', 'are', 'least', 'family', 'worries', 'trip', 'physical', 'emotional', 'toll', 'involved.So', 'who', 'do', 'have', 'here', 'must', 'start', 'Emilia', 'Graciana', 'Chironi', 'matriarch', 'family', 'was', 'idea', 'whole', 'family', 'travel', 'Misiones', 'marriage', 'niece', 'position', 'very', 'heart', 'family', 'film', 'Emilia', 'endurance', 'pushed', 'limits', 'heat', 'cramped', 'conditions', 'general', 'behavior', 'family', 'members', 'can', 'criticize', 'never', 'control', 'Sisters', 'Claudia', 'Marta', 'are', 'married', 'Oscar', 'Fatso', 'Ernesto', 'respectively', ""n't"", 'keep', 'Ernesto', 'putting', 'moves', 'Marta', 'know', 'good', 'can', 'come', 'further', 'generation', 'down', 'have', 'Paula', 'who', 'brought', 'baby', 'row', 'boyfriend', 'certainly', 'volatile', 'situation', 'when', 'said', 'boyfriend', 'up', 'also', 'Yanina', 'who', 'hots', 'cousin', 'Gustavo', 'who', 'turn', 'prefers', 'friend', 'Yanina', 'brought', 'along', 'trip', 'not', 'averse', 'messing', 'around', 'cousin', 'well', 'Young', 'Matias', 'actually', 'sanest', 'most', 'civil', 'one', 'whole', 'lot', 'sneak', 'dog', 'ride.Much', 'made', 'Graciana', 'Chironi', 'performance', 'Emilia', 'rightfully', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'real', 'human', 'role', 'What', 'performance', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'fact', 'had', 'never', 'acted', 'professionally', 'did', 'have', 'quite', 'rapport', 'director', 'fact', 'director', 'Pablo', 'Trapero', 'very', 'own', 'grandmother', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'story', 'particularly', 'close', 'Trapero', 'heart', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'inspired', 'own', 'childhood', 'memories', 'family', 'camping', 'trips', 'trips', 'were', 'made', 'very', 'same', 'van', 'used', 'filming', 'movie.Rolling', 'Family', 'really', 'unabashed', 'look', 'interdynamics', 'family', 'life', 'Feelings', 'emotions', 'might', 'have', 'festered', 'surface', 'years', 'explode', 'pressure', 'mucho', 'caliente', 'conditions', 'hot', 'loud', 'basically', 'just', 'crazy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'found', 'film', 'heartwarming', 'real', 'yes', 'heartwarming', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'way', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ending', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'lot', 'do', 'ending', 'ending', 'rather', 'conclusion', 'lack', 'cloture', 'sort', 'bothered', 'initially', ""'m"", 'coming', 'around', 'idea', 'really', 'fitting', 'way', 'end', 'things', 'cloture', 'life', 'never', 'moment', 'when', 'know', 'sure', 'what', 'gone', 'down', 'lives', 'certainly', 'point', 'something', 'worrisome', ""n't"", 'loom', 'somewhere', 'future.This', 'was', 'first', 'Argentinean', 'film', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'DVD', 'have', 'English', 'subtitles', 'reminding', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'everything', 'ever', 'used', 'know', 'Spanish', 'film', 'served', 'up', 'wonderful', 'albeit', 'limited', 'introduction', 'Argentinean', 'countryside', 'extent', 'people', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'puzzled', ""'m"", 'sure', 'due', 'relative', 'ignorance', 'cultural', 'aspects', 'Argentina', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'about', 'though', 'family', 'family', 'are', 'language', 'speak']",N/A

Still, it is certainly worth seeing.  On one level it works as a cautionary tale of the extended family vacation you'd never want to take.  On another it shows an Argentina far from the rush and glitz of Buenos Aires.  It is also a dead-on portrayal of Argentine character types that will be immediately recognizable to anyone who has spent time in the country.  And, finally, it is a serious comedy or maybe a comic drama -- I haven't decided which.  The acting is uniformly good, the director knows family dynamics (how much of the film may be autobiographical is unclear) and, even as they endure the rigors of the crowded quarters of an ancient van, the moments of affection and bickering in the journey both affirm and change each individual's life.",4,Deep in the Heart of Argentina,1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,910,"['do', ""n't"", 'put', 'Rolling', 'Family', 'up', 'favorite', 'Argentine', 'movies', 'such', 'Headless', 'Woman', 'two', 'films', 'Fabian', 'Belinsky', 'Nine', 'Queens', 'Aura', 'Still', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'one', 'level', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'extended', 'family', 'vacation', ""'d"", 'never', 'want', 'take', 'Argentina', 'far', 'rush', 'glitz', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'also', 'dead-on', 'portrayal', 'Argentine', 'character', 'types', 'will', 'be', 'immediately', 'recognizable', 'anyone', 'who', 'spent', 'time', 'country', 'finally', 'serious', 'comedy', 'maybe', 'comic', 'drama', 'have', ""n't"", 'decided', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'good', 'director', 'family', 'dynamics', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'autobiographical', 'unclear', 'even', 'endure', 'rigors', 'crowded', 'quarters', 'ancient', 'van', 'moments', 'affection', 'bickering', 'journey', 'affirm', 'change', 'individual', 'life']",N/A

Well, I think that in this film Argentinian director Pablo Trapero illustrates that concept well, even though the main characters in his movie are related and generally get along.The story that ""Rolling family"" tells begins when Emilia (Graciana Chironi), an elderly grandmother that also happens to be the matriarch of a large family, decides that she wants to go to the wedding of a niece she hasn't seen in a very long time. Her niece lives faraway, so Emilia takes advantage of the situation and invites her whole family on the trip.As a favor to her, Emilia's relatives accept her proposal, even though they don't feel eager to share too much time with each other. That is the beginning of a chaotic cross-country journey, from Buenos Aires to Misiones. Did I mention that the trip is made in an old camper that has more than a few mechanical problems? And that everybody is crammed inside it? Certainly not comfortable travel arrangements, but it makes for good comedy, with more than a few ingredients of drama.On the whole, I think that ""Rolling family"" is a very good film, that you are likely to enjoy. The scenery is beautiful, and the traditional Argentinian music something you will appreciate, but the real treat this movie offers you is a glimpse into the life of a family so well depicted that it seems real.

As she celebrates her birthday she reveals her desire to travel across country to the wedding of a distant nice. They eagerly join her in a cross-country quest to the border of Brazil.Rolling Family then becomes a drama staged around the journey in a 1956 Chevy Viking Camper. As they come to terms with the complexity of all traveling in a cramped space, their lives are jolted into new territory where they must face love, loss and life-changing decisions. That anger, sorrow, passionate attractions and a few emotional outbursts keeps the energy flowing through the story.Director Pablo Trapero choice to cast his own grandmother, Graciana Chironi, in the role of Emila was an excellent decision. I loved seeing her tending to her garden and it reminded me of my grandmother and how she always took care of her roses in the backyard. She takes so naturally to the role that you would never imagine she was not a professional actress. Her loving presence adds great warmth to the film. I loved that the camper was the same one the director's family spent time in when he was a child.The scenery and locations are all beautiful and you feel like you could step into this movie and you would be home.~The Rebecca Review",5,Family Drama in Argentina,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,1270,"['Emila', 'warm', 'personality', 'draws', 'story', 'birthday', 'desire', 'travel', 'country', 'wedding', 'distant', 'nice', 'eagerly', 'join', 'cross-country', 'quest', 'border', 'Brazil.Rolling', 'Family', 'then', 'drama', 'staged', 'journey', '1956', 'Chevy', 'Viking', 'Camper', 'come', 'terms', 'complexity', 'traveling', 'cramped', 'space', 'lives', 'are', 'jolted', 'new', 'territory', 'where', 'must', 'face', 'love', 'loss', 'life-changing', 'decisions', 'anger', 'sorrow', 'passionate', 'attractions', 'few', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'keeps', 'energy', 'flowing', 'story.Director', 'Pablo', 'Trapero', 'choice', 'cast', 'own', 'grandmother', 'Graciana', 'Chironi', 'role', 'Emila', 'was', 'excellent', 'decision', 'loved', 'seeing', 'tending', 'garden', 'reminded', 'grandmother', 'how', 'always', 'took', 'care', 'roses', 'backyard', 'so', 'naturally', 'role', 'would', 'never', 'imagine', 'was', 'not', 'professional', 'actress', 'loving', 'presence', 'great', 'warmth', 'film', 'loved', 'camper', 'was', 'same', 'one', 'director', 'family', 'spent', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'child.The', 'scenery', 'locations', 'are', 'beautiful', 'feel', 'could', 'step', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'home.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A
