1660542,A1WVA7V02PQOY6,B00DQFWFMC,Dad of Divas,"[6, 7]","This was a great new DVD perfect for the upcoming holiday season. My daughters are both My Little Pony fans, so they got right into this and afterwards when I asked what they liked best, they both said ""all of it"", good description right? I have to say that in watching this, I loved some of the underlying themes that were in it regarding friendship and sharing. While these two messages are ones that I have seen in other My Little Pony shows. This was a great throwback and because it originally came out when my oldest was only one she did not see it previously. Overall, this is a great movie for any family to get their hands on especially if your family are fans of My Little Pony, but also if you enjoy exposing your kids to well done cartoons that have positive messages. I highly recommend!*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*",5,Thanks for bringing this back!,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,856,"['was', 'great', 'new', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'upcoming', 'holiday', 'season', 'daughters', 'are', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'fans', 'got', 'right', 'afterwards', 'when', 'asked', 'what', 'liked', 'best', 'said', 'good', 'description', 'right', 'have', 'say', 'watching', 'loved', 'underlying', 'themes', 'were', 'regarding', 'friendship', 'sharing', 'two', 'messages', 'are', 'ones', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'was', 'great', 'throwback', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'oldest', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'previously', 'Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'family', 'get', 'hands', 'especially', 'family', 'are', 'fans', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'also', 'enjoy', 'exposing', 'kids', 'well', 'done', 'cartoons', 'have', 'positive', 'messages', 'highly', 'recommend', '*I', 'received', 'copy', 'review', 'opinions', 'are', 'own*']",My Little Pony: A Very Minty Christmas
