While not as intense as shows like AMAZING RACE or SURVIVOR, it was entertaining and also really funny with a lot of LOL moments. I was completely wrong about who the MOLE was as well.

While  I would agree that this season doesn't stack up to its predecessors, it isn't that bad.  It has some hillarious moments and sure, the players are light-hearted but I wouldn't say they weren't taking the game seriously.  Kathy was a vigorous note-taker and Michael and Erik were very intense at times.  In addition, Frederique amounts to being a very good mole, far better than Bill or Kathryn, so in that respect, this season has a leg up on the first two.  The challenges are also pretty darn good.

797406,A3GOJ0VNVZSZPQ,B0001A7UZW,Raymond C. Ruether,"[10, 11]","I'd been waiting for another MOLE season for quite some time, and when the first Celebrity Mole edition was originally produced, it was a bit of a letdown.  With Anderson Cooper gone to CNN and with celebrities featured as players instead of everyday people, I approached the series with some trepidation.  Elements that were so integral to the game would seemingly vanish (for example, language and culture barriers, no contact with the outside world, etc.), so my expectations were really not that high.  However, as the show aired I was pleasantly surprised.  The celebrities injected quite a bit of fun into the game, and the challenges (although they weren't quite the caliber of the original Mole) were quite  entertaining and well-thought-out.  It was hilarious watching Corbin Bernsen overanalyze everything in front of him, Frederique was gorgeous and used her charms and her accent quite adeptly, and Kathy Griffin was a hoot as always!  I also give a lot of credit to Ahmad Rashad; he had a very tough act to follow and he was a very amiable host with a great sense of humor.  It's really unfair to compare him side-by-side with Anderson Cooper; let's just say Ahmad did a fantastic job in his own right as host.  You'll get the entire Celebrity Mole:  Hawaii season here, as well as a host of out-takes and deleted scenes.  Bottom line, it may not exactly be THE MOLE that we've been craving for several years now, but CELEBRITY MOLE:  HAWAII is still highly enjoyable.",4,Better than I had expected!,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,1481,"[""'d"", 'been', 'waiting', 'MOLE', 'season', 'quite', 'time', 'when', 'first', 'Celebrity', 'Mole', 'edition', 'was', 'originally', 'produced', 'was', 'bit', 'letdown', 'Anderson', 'Cooper', 'gone', 'CNN', 'celebrities', 'featured', 'players', 'instead', 'everyday', 'people', 'approached', 'series', 'trepidation', 'Elements', 'were', 'so', 'integral', 'game', 'would', 'seemingly', 'vanish', 'example', 'language', 'culture', 'barriers', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'etc', 'expectations', 'were', 'really', 'not', 'high', 'However', 'show', 'aired', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'celebrities', 'injected', 'quite', 'bit', 'fun', 'game', 'challenges', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'caliber', 'original', 'Mole', 'were', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'well-thought-out', 'was', 'hilarious', 'watching', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'overanalyze', 'everything', 'front', 'Frederique', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'used', 'charms', 'accent', 'quite', 'adeptly', 'Kathy', 'Griffin', 'was', 'hoot', 'always', 'also', 'give', 'lot', 'credit', 'Ahmad', 'Rashad', 'had', 'very', 'tough', 'act', 'follow', 'was', 'very', 'amiable', 'host', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'really', 'unfair', 'compare', 'side-by-side', 'Anderson', 'Cooper', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Ahmad', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'own', 'right', 'host', ""'ll"", 'get', 'entire', 'Celebrity', 'Mole', 'Hawaii', 'season', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'host', 'out-takes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Bottom', 'line', 'may', 'not', 'exactly', 'be', 'THE', 'MOLE', ""'ve"", 'been', 'craving', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'CELEBRITY', 'MOLE', 'HAWAII', 'still', 'highly', 'enjoyable']",Celebrity Mole - Hawaii

797408,ABWHLZFEM5SZY,B0001A7UZW,R. Jensen,"[0, 0]","This season while amusing definutly ranks below other seasons of the mole for many reasons.Let's start out with what's good about this season. First the humor like I said is quite good, be it remarks from the cast/host or fails on assignments or music in a specific moment: you should be laughing your heads off while watching this. Also if you know any of these celebrities you should enjoy seeing them on camera and have a good time with them. The assignments are clever, every cast member has reasons you want them to stick around, (Except maybe the first one booted) or for being the mole (Again except for the first one booted). The mole did a fantastic job and interal conflicts between the cast really aid the show.Now here's the bad side of the coin. Being a smaller cast half the people go before you can really view everyone long enough to form suspishions about them (The first two excecuted later reveal that's why they left). Also shorter cast and shorter seasons made ties happen more often, which didn't suit me. Also the last assignment had a possible penalty option that was really ineffective to the point it didn't even matter that the penalties occured. The cast also doesn't develop at all which was something, that hooked me to the first two seasons and later the 5th one. Also the host's personality (while good, doesn't have the same effect as Anderson Cooper).I did enjoy watching but probubly won't buy the dvds and just watch it from another source because it does merit rewatches, just not well enough to own it unless it's a combo deal.",3,Good for the humor and conflict but thats it (SPOILER ALER NO NAMES),1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,1565,"['season', 'amusing', 'definutly', 'ranks', 'other', 'seasons', 'mole', 'many', 'reasons.Let', 'start', 'what', 'good', 'season', 'First', 'humor', 'said', 'quite', 'good', 'be', 'remarks', 'cast/host', 'fails', 'assignments', 'music', 'specific', 'moment', 'should', 'be', 'laughing', 'heads', 'off', 'watching', 'Also', 'know', 'celebrities', 'should', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'camera', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'assignments', 'are', 'clever', 'cast', 'member', 'reasons', 'want', 'stick', 'around', 'maybe', 'first', 'one', 'booted', 'being', 'mole', 'Again', 'first', 'one', 'booted', 'mole', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'interal', 'conflicts', 'cast', 'really', 'aid', 'show.Now', 'here', 'bad', 'side', 'coin', 'Being', 'smaller', 'cast', 'people', 'go', 'can', 'really', 'view', 'everyone', 'long', 'enough', 'form', 'suspishions', 'first', 'two', 'excecuted', 'later', 'reveal', 'why', 'left', 'Also', 'shorter', 'cast', 'shorter', 'seasons', 'made', 'ties', 'happen', 'more', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'suit', 'Also', 'last', 'assignment', 'had', 'possible', 'penalty', 'option', 'was', 'really', 'ineffective', 'point', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'matter', 'penalties', 'occured', 'cast', 'also', ""n't"", 'develop', 'was', 'something', 'hooked', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'later', '5th', 'one', 'Also', 'host', 'personality', 'good', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'effect', 'Anderson', 'Cooper', '.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'probubly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'dvds', 'just', 'watch', 'source', 'merit', 'rewatches', 'just', 'not', 'well', 'enough', 'own', 'combo', 'deal']",Celebrity Mole - Hawaii
797409,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0001A7UZW,trebe,"[1, 1]","The Mole was one of ABC's early forays into ""reality"" TV.  The concept involved ten individuals taking part in various group tasks, that added money to a community pot.  At the end of each episode, one player was eliminated, with the eventual winner getting the entire amount in the pot.  The twist in the game which is known to everyone, is that one of the players is actually The Mole, a player who is not out to win the cash, but instead is acting to gum up the works, and try and keep money from being contributed to the pot.  The object of the game is to avoid becoming a victim of The Mole.Celebrity Mole Hawaii takes the original concept, and puts `celebrities' into the game.  Participants include actors Corbin Bernsen, Michael Boatman, Erik von Detten, Kim Coles, Steven Baldwin, model Frederique, and comic Kathy Griffin.  Altogether, not the most physically fit group.The Big Island of Hawaii, provides the setting for tasks that include walking on hot lava rack, cliff diving, surfing, dancing the hula and hanging over a waterfall.  For this event, a serious host like Anderson Cooper probably isn't appropriate.  So while a little dull, Ahmad Rashad does an adequate job.If you enjoyed the original, CMH might be worth checking out. With `celebrities' are involved, there's more of a focus on the players and their interaction with each other, with less excitement and suspense generated by the actual playing of the game.  The group is diverse mix of personality types, which leads to some spirited and entertaining exchanges between the players.",3,The Mole . . .
