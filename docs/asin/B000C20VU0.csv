954471,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000C20VU0,A Customer,"[2, 2]","There's nothing particularly wrong with Roman Polanski's new Oliver Twist, it looks great and has a lovely musical score, but there's something wrong when at the movie's end all you can talk about are the sets, lighting, costumes, and music. One gets the feeling that the award-winning director, who so moved us with the Pianist a few years ago, just didn't have his heart in it or was unable to connect emotionally to the story. Technically sound and surprisingly faithful to its source material, this Oliver Twist comes across as rather uninspired and flat.Most frustrating is that we hardly need another movie adaptation of Oliver Twist when there are other Dickens books that haven't been given the major movie treatment that would better suit Polanski's talented vision. Which begs the question of why it was even made. I'm not quite sure why this version of Oliver Twist doesn't work, all the attributes are there, it has high production values and inspired character actors. It's all totally acceptable, yet the movie seems to lack passion.Polanski does, however, breath some life into the essential themes of the novel. The juxtaposing forces of human misery and kindness are all there, along with the scathing social comment. Oliver's life is indeed tragic. His story begins at an orphanage, but he is soon kicked out for bad behavior. His next stop is working for a coffin-maker, but mistreatment causes him to run away. After a cruel, seven-day trek to London, he meets Artful Dodger (Harry Eden) and becomes one of the merry band of thieves ruled by the rapacious Fagin (Ben Kingsley).A chance encounter with a wealthy businessman, Mr. Brownlow (Edward Hardwicke), gives Oliver a chance at a better life, but Fagin and his cutthroat associate, Bill Sikes (Jamie Foreman) are unwilling to let him move on. They find a way to pull him back in and use Mr. Brownlow's affection for Oliver to their advantage. Only Nancy, (Leanne Rowe) Bill's wife, shows compassion for poor Oliver. But of course, will the evil Bill out to get her, Nancy's days are most likely numbered.Perhaps the biggest problem with Oliver Twist is Barney Clark as the courteous and innocent Oliver. He looks great, but like the rest of the movie, he is presentable without being compelling. For the story to work, sympathy with Oliver is mandatory, but Clark's acting and Polanski's direction keep the character at arm's length. Only two performances - that of Leanne Rowe as Nancy Sikes and Jamie Foreman as Bill Sikes - have power and force. You really care about Nancy and obviously want Bill to get retribution, but Oliver comes across as strangely negligible.Polanski's interpretation is very much a Masterpiece Theater style adaptation, with higher production values. It looks good and hits all the high points, but it's ultimately cool and unemotional. It doesn't help that much of the melodramatic elements of the book have been toned down, when they should have been played up!

954473,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B000C20VU0,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[33, 34]","I have not seen any of the many film or TV versions of Charles Dickens' 1837 classic, and have no basis of comparison for Polanski's take on Oliver Twist. That may be a good thing, as I have no preconceived notions of what this film ought to be. Barney Clark's portrayal of the foundling born in a countryside workhouse, enslaved at age 10 by a feeble funeral director and his imposing wife, and escaped to the bowels of London, is nothing short of magnificent.Polanksi's account of Oliver's tragic childhood, survival and ultimate adoption by the kindly rich gentleman, Mr. Brownlow (Edward Hardwicke), fits precisely into the image painted in Dickens' lengthy page turner. As one would expect, he embellishes the film with extraordinarily realistic scenes of the 19th century British countryside, hardscrabble streets and alleyways of London's ""Spittlefield"" slum and Brownlow's suburban mansion.But Polanski also engaged impressive performances from Ben Kingsley as Fagin, the bent (and evil) old fence and the leader of London thieves and pickpockets, Jamie Foreman as the house-breaker and murderer Bill Sykes, and Leanne Rowe as the motherly Nancy who in the end saves Oliver's life at the cost of her own. Kingsley's Fagin is every bit as conniving and devious as readers recall. But he also occasionally shines with glints of kindness towards Oliver, the Artful Dodger (Harry Eden) and the rest of his youthful gang, not to mention remorse over Nancy's fate, thus inspiring viewers' sympathies for the poor and downtrodden in 19th Century England and consideration of the very real moral dilemmas of that age.Of course, no two-hour movie could possibly include all the intricacies or characters of a Dickens novel, and this one is no exception. Thus, some readers may miss Oliver's half-brother Monks, Widow Corney and the story line concerning Oliver's history. But this in no way detracts from the movie's success. Nor does it prevent Polanski from hitting home runs with bit parts--for example, Alun Armstrong as the foul-tempered magistrate, Mr. Fang, and Mark Strong as the dandy Toby Crackit, an accomplice to the evil Bill Sykes.In the main, however, Polanski zeros in on the tragedy of Oliver's life. There's something heroic in him, to be sure. And the happy ending is indeed welcome. But this doesn't erase the horrors that he suffers before his final rescue--his mother's death in the workhouse, starvation, enslavement, abuse,  kidnapping, and the destruction of his innocence by men who exploit children.In short, Polanski strikes the chords that have made Oliver's story a hit for nearly 170 years: He brings the hero's suffering to life and touches the lost child in all of us, young and old alike.--Alyssa A.

954474,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000C20VU0,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","The story of `Oliver Twist' is very widely known and has been done time and time again for the big as well as the small screen.  When you attach an Oscar winning director like Roman Polanski to the more recent adaptation of the Dickens classic you start to get your hopes up, because in all technicality it should be amazing.  Well, technically speaking it is.  The sets are flawless, the costumes are accurate, the mannerisms and speech of the characters seems to fit well.  Everything seems to work, but for some reason it just doesn't.  I found myself dreadfully bored throughout most of the film, and the facets of the film that were so lauded upon its release (they actually threw Kingsley into contention during the Oscar race) were found by me to be ridiculously over-praised.I don't think I need to go into the story behind `Oliver Twist' since just about everyone knows what this film is about.  Young Oliver, an orphan, finds himself taken in by a band of young thieves, all controlled by the devious Fagin.  When Oliver jeopardizes Fagin's livelihood and dastardly Bill Sykes makes it his mission to take care of Oliver.The acting is decent at best, aside from a few standouts.  Barney Clark is not very strong in my opinion.  He manages to grow with the film, and by the films closing I either was used to his blemishes or he had actually corrected most of them.  Jamie Foreman is no where near as villainous as he should have been.  Sure, we hate the character of Bill Sykes, but here we are more or less hating his actions as apposed to his person.  A better actor would have really made us loathe everything about him.  Kingsley is a mess as Fagin.  In my humble opinion he is the worst thing about this movie.  His performances is ridiculously comical and honestly takes away from the seriousness of the film.  Then there is Leanne Rowe and Harry Eden, two shining stars in a vast sea of mediocrity.  As Nancy and the Artful Dodger respectively these two actors really `get' their characters.  Rowe is soft and sincere and Eden is superbly cast in a role that really should have been the only one getting any sort of Oscar attention.What the film lacks in the cast it does make up for in picture.  The cinematography is splendid to say the least; truly gorgeous to look at, and like I mentioned, the set pieces and costumes and all that comes with it are fantastic as well.  Polanski captures a mood with this film, and I admired that, but for some reason the film as a whole comes across rather dull and uninspired to me.I know that my distaste for this film is not really the popular vote here.  Maybe I just watched this on a bad day or something and probably should give it another try before I go around condemning it (which is not what I'm doing for it does have its redeeming factors).  I just don't think that this is the version to go with.  It looks updated and glossy and prettier than the previous adaptations, but the older versions in my opinion have a little more heart and are much more endearing.  This version just doesn't have that extra something to keep my interest.  Polanski is a masterful director and this style really suits him (`The Pianist' is one of my favorite films) but this is not one of his grandest attempts and the end result is much less than I personally expected.",3,It truly looks beautiful; it just feels rather bland...,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,3318,"['story', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'very', 'widely', 'known', 'been', 'done', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'big', 'as', 'well', 'small', 'screen', 'When', 'attach', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'more', 'recent', 'adaptation', 'Dickens', 'classic', 'start', 'get', 'hopes', 'up', 'technicality', 'should', 'be', 'amazing', 'Well', 'technically', 'speaking', 'sets', 'are', 'flawless', 'costumes', 'are', 'accurate', 'mannerisms', 'speech', 'characters', 'fit', 'well', 'Everything', 'work', 'reason', 'just', ""n't"", 'found', 'dreadfully', 'bored', 'most', 'film', 'facets', 'film', 'were', 'so', 'lauded', 'release', 'actually', 'threw', 'Kingsley', 'contention', 'Oscar', 'race', 'were', 'found', 'be', 'ridiculously', 'over-praised.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'go', 'story', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'just', 'everyone', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'Young', 'Oliver', 'orphan', 'taken', 'band', 'young', 'thieves', 'controlled', 'devious', 'Fagin', 'When', 'Oliver', 'Fagin', 'livelihood', 'dastardly', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'mission', 'take', 'care', 'Oliver.The', 'acting', 'decent', 'best', 'aside', 'few', 'standouts', 'Barney', 'Clark', 'not', 'very', 'strong', 'opinion', 'grow', 'film', 'films', 'closing', 'was', 'used', 'blemishes', 'had', 'actually', 'corrected', 'most', 'Jamie', 'Foreman', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'villainous', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Sure', 'hate', 'character', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'here', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'hating', 'actions', 'apposed', 'person', 'better', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'made', 'loathe', 'everything', 'Kingsley', 'mess', 'Fagin', 'humble', 'opinion', 'worst', 'thing', 'movie', 'performances', 'ridiculously', 'comical', 'honestly', 'away', 'seriousness', 'film', 'Then', 'Leanne', 'Rowe', 'Harry', 'Eden', 'two', 'shining', 'stars', 'vast', 'sea', 'mediocrity', 'Nancy', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'respectively', 'two', 'actors', 'really', 'get', 'characters', 'Rowe', 'soft', 'sincere', 'Eden', 'superbly', 'cast', 'role', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'one', 'getting', 'sort', 'Oscar', 'film', 'cast', 'make', 'up', 'picture', 'cinematography', 'splendid', 'say', 'least', 'truly', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'mentioned', 'set', 'pieces', 'costumes', 'are', 'fantastic', 'well', 'Polanski', 'mood', 'film', 'admired', 'reason', 'film', 'whole', 'rather', 'dull', 'uninspired', 'me.I', 'know', 'distaste', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'popular', 'vote', 'here', 'Maybe', 'just', 'watched', 'bad', 'day', 'something', 'probably', 'should', 'give', 'try', 'go', 'around', 'condemning', 'not', 'what', ""'m"", 'doing', 'have', 'redeeming', 'factors', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'version', 'go', 'updated', 'glossy', 'prettier', 'previous', 'adaptations', 'older', 'versions', 'opinion', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'heart', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'endearing', 'version', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'extra', 'something', 'keep', 'interest', 'Polanski', 'masterful', 'director', 'style', 'really', 'suits', 'Pianist', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'not', 'one', 'grandest', 'attempts', 'end', 'result', 'much', 'less', 'personally', 'expected']",N/A
954475,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B000C20VU0,Andrew Raker,"[4, 4]","I am an aficionado of Charles Dickens. I know his literary works inside and out. I consider him a great author (even if he was a bit eccentric and long-winded.) However, after watching this film, (which I purchased for a very low price), I have two questions I would like to have asked the producers and script-writers.(1) What was the purpose of making another version of Charles Dicken's classic 400 page novel?(2) Did you really expect the film to sell well considering how many other competing versions are in existence?In answer to the first question, I think people in charge of the production believed that there were not enough other wonderful versions of the novel. Polanski in an interview noted that the last really good Oliver Twist film was the musical ""Oliver!"" from 1968 with Mark Lester Ron Moody. It won 6 academy awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Maybe its success could be duplicated?!In answer to the second question, it is possible that people believed if the acting was well-done (which I think it was), the sets were well-created (I think they were), and the story seemed believable (I think it does) then people would be willing to spend money to see the film in theaters.Now, the film did not perform very well at the box office even though I believe Barney Clark and Ben Kingsley both played their roles wonderfully (especially Kingsley). I believe the reasons are as follows:People know the major elements of plot of Oliver Twist. It is a very famous work of classic British Literature. Children read it in middle school, in high school, and in college. Few aficionado's of literature could possibly have missed understanding the basic plot of the novel. What some people (at least this writer) would have liked to have seen more of is addressing of the subplots (i.e. those concerning Monks, Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble, the Dodger's court scene,  etc.) These aspects are not addressed AT ALL in this film, which instead changes some of the action, (i.e. Mr. Brownlow's house is ""robbed"" in Polanski's version.)If the acting in this film could have been created into a miniseries like the BBC Oliver Twist miniseries of 1985 with Ben Rodska and Eric Porter (only with better acting and better sets), it could have done well on television. People would have watched it. However, clearly this would not be practical from a financial standpoint.In short, this 120 minute film gives good acting, an interesting plot (even if subplots are lost), and decent extra-features. However, it fails to play out the book - the one aspect that might hold more people's interests.

While the 1968 Oliver film is rated ""G"", this version is rated ""PG-13"" for violence.  However, I would not hesitate to give it as a gift to someone under 13.  I feel the movie is very well done, and the special features do a great job in illustrating how the movie was made.  My only complaint is what another reviewer noted.  Namely, I found some of the dialogue hard to understand due to the accent of the actors.  Hence, I give the movie four stars rather than five.

954480,A29COAL60SB48B,B000C20VU0,Donna Di Giacomo,"[4, 6]","Roman Polanski has a talent that a minute number of directors in the world possess and that is to accurately translate a book to the big screen.  He did it with Rosemary's Baby in 1968, The Tenant in 1976, Tess in 1979 and now with Oliver Twist.While it may not be the ""definitive version"" of the Charles Dickens tale, Polanski pretty much spelled out 19th century London (and its countryside) that Dickens described in his book (to *great* detail).For those who have read the novel, you'll know that it's not a very cheery tale (which would explain the dreary look of many scenes).  Sure, little Oliver wins out in the end because of Mr. Brownlow's generosity and Nancy's being a mother figure to him, but what Oliver has to go through to win in the end is nothing short of tragic.  He was treated terribly in the orphanage, was put into an apprenticeship where he was a slave/punching bag, spent days walking to London, unknowingly gets caught up with a group of thieves (and is reluctant to be a criminal), finally finds someone willing to give him charity only to be kidnapped back into the gang.  As I read the book all I could think was, ""How many more obstacles is this poor kid going to have to face?  Give the poor thing a break already!""  I wanted to wrap my arms around little Oliver and tell him someone cared (before Mr. Brownlow came along).  Dickens used his experience in poorhouses for the storyline but boy did he stretch it!The only complaint I have (if you can call it that) is that the running time was too short.  Some details of the book were changed for celluloid and it's a shame because I really believe Roman would have spelled out those scenes beautifully.But he did a great job with what he had.  The costumes, the scenery, the dialogue, the cast (Barney Clark was the perfect Oliver and Nancy was portrayed even prettier than I had imagined) - the wait for this was well worth it ... and then some!Watching a Polanski film is quite the experience!

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","THE ADVENTURES OF OLIVER TWIST by Charles Dickens, published in 1838, has been a standard classic that - for some strange reason- reminds me of Twain's ""Pudd'nhead Wilson"". No one seems to want to read it through. Films of it are another matter.Oddly, when we consider film versions of ""Oliver"", we think of the Fagins - what I call the ""sweet role"" of a work.In this version (2005, the ""Ben Kingsley version"" as he plays Fagin) we have a brightened up, altogether sunnier version. It is colorful, well acted, well detailed and I love the extended sequence of Oliver (a sweet and talented Barney Clark) walking to the city.Oliver is meant to be about an innocent little angel's voyage through hell, but this film dumbs it down a lot. Another mystery for me: why were so many characters left out, some left in, some totally changed (such as Oliver's grandfather)?Certainly Kingsley's Fagin deserves mention. He did copy quite a bit from Guinness' classic 1948 version (vid. my review), but here Kingsley opted for a lot more pathos. His cackling voice, his twinkling eyes may be too much for an unnatural old vagabond, but Kingsley sells it well.As to the 1948 classic: I think this movie in many instances is a shot-for-shot remake. Certainly filmed in many of the same places and the sets are nearly identical. In this newer version, much is made of Oliver's apprenticeship to the undertaker, but I suspect that is a mere muddling of the original story. Nonetheless highly enjoyable.In any case, I cannot recommend this film enough as a family-oriented, fun version - and not too shallow for all that. You must have this in your collection!I subtracted one star for the copying from the 1948 film and for the further muddling of what should have been a superior modern classic film.",4,"Please sir, could we have some more?",1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,1783,"['ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'OLIVER', 'TWIST', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'published', '1838', 'been', 'standard', 'classic', 'strange', 'reason-', 'reminds', 'Twain', ""Pudd'nhead"", 'Wilson', 'one', 'want', 'read', 'Films', 'are', 'matter.Oddly', 'when', 'consider', 'film', 'versions', 'Oliver', 'think', 'Fagins', 'what', 'call', 'sweet', 'role', 'work.In', 'version', '2005', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'version', 'Fagin', 'have', 'brightened', 'up', 'altogether', 'sunnier', 'version', 'colorful', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'detailed', 'love', 'extended', 'sequence', 'Oliver', 'sweet', 'talented', 'Barney', 'Clark', 'walking', 'city.Oliver', 'meant', 'be', 'innocent', 'little', 'angel', 'voyage', 'hell', 'film', 'down', 'lot', 'mystery', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'left', 'out', 'left', 'totally', 'changed', 'such', 'Oliver', 'grandfather', 'Certainly', 'Kingsley', 'Fagin', 'mention', 'did', 'copy', 'quite', 'bit', 'Guinness', 'classic', '1948', 'version', 'vid', 'review', 'here', 'Kingsley', 'opted', 'lot', 'more', 'pathos', 'cackling', 'voice', 'twinkling', 'eyes', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'unnatural', 'old', 'vagabond', 'Kingsley', '1948', 'classic', 'think', 'movie', 'many', 'instances', 'shot-for-shot', 'remake', 'Certainly', 'filmed', 'many', 'same', 'places', 'sets', 'are', 'nearly', 'identical', 'newer', 'version', 'much', 'made', 'Oliver', 'apprenticeship', 'undertaker', 'suspect', 'mere', 'muddling', 'original', 'story', 'Nonetheless', 'highly', 'case', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'enough', 'family-oriented', 'fun', 'version', 'not', 'too', 'shallow', 'must', 'have', 'collection', 'subtracted', 'one', 'star', 'copying', '1948', 'film', 'further', 'muddling', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'superior', 'modern', 'classic', 'film']",N/A

Although it is not a perfect representation of the book, the director, Roman Polanski, did a commendable job of bringing to life a well known story.The film, just like the book, is a dark and depressing story of a young orphan, Oliver Twist (well played by Barney Clark) who grows up in a cruel and uncaring world of Victorian England. The movie was well made, with authentic costumes of the Victorian era and beautiful photography. The gloomy setting in the wet, stinky and dingy London captures the cruel and depressing environment that Oliver lived.Barney Clark played the role of Oliver Twist very well as an innocent child who grows up in a workhouse where food was scarce, then at an undertaker before finally fleeing to London to fall into the company of a gang of pickpockets.  The movie unfolds to reveal and remind us of the themes of child abuse, orphans, women abuse, and problems of poverty as well as reminding us that despite the gloomy and depressing environment that people may find themselves, there are always some good and compassionate people around.A depressing and action packed movie with good acting all round that is well worth watching.",4,A Good Movie,1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,1266,"['read', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'school', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'saw', 'movie', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'perfect', 'representation', 'book', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'did', 'commendable', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'well', 'known', 'story.The', 'film', 'just', 'book', 'dark', 'depressing', 'story', 'young', 'orphan', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'well', 'played', 'Barney', 'Clark', 'who', 'up', 'cruel', 'uncaring', 'world', 'Victorian', 'England', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'made', 'authentic', 'costumes', 'Victorian', 'era', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'gloomy', 'setting', 'wet', 'stinky', 'dingy', 'London', 'cruel', 'depressing', 'environment', 'Oliver', 'lived.Barney', 'Clark', 'played', 'role', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'very', 'well', 'innocent', 'child', 'who', 'up', 'workhouse', 'where', 'food', 'was', 'scarce', 'then', 'undertaker', 'finally', 'fleeing', 'London', 'fall', 'company', 'gang', 'pickpockets', 'movie', 'reveal', 'remind', 'themes', 'child', 'abuse', 'orphans', 'women', 'abuse', 'problems', 'poverty', 'as', 'well', 'reminding', 'gloomy', 'depressing', 'environment', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'are', 'always', 'good', 'compassionate', 'people', 'around.A', 'depressing', 'action', 'packed', 'movie', 'good', 'acting', 'round', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

954487,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000C20VU0,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","Charles Dickens' famous story of the perseverance of the individual in the crumbling society of poverty in mid 19th century London has been scripted for film many times: the catalogue lists 19 versions and that doesn't include some films using the matrix of the story only.  The results are variably successful: David Lean's 1948 version is brilliant, Renny Rey's 4 part mini series in 1999 was good, Tony Bill's TV film in 1999 had the flavor, the musical version 'Oliver!' was a resounding success, and even Jacob Tierney's 'Twist' from 2003 with the pickpockets as male hustlers had its magic moments.  Now here comes Roman Polanski with yet another adaptation of the warhorse novel, and while there are many fine aspects of this version, there are many problems that seem to be overlooked.Polanski creates a visual masterpiece of England and especially London of 1850, opting for sepia and brown tones to give the dark film a sense of the muck and filth that were de rigueur in that time of dirt streets and horse drawn carriages.  His sets do appear to be backstage constructions but they offer the right atmosphere.  There are some fine actors involved, especially Ben Kingsley as one of the more successful Fagin interpreters.  But somewhere along the line Polanski let the scenery and costumes take over and the screenplay and direction offer us the shell outline of the story but the fine actors are not given the opportunity to become fleshed out adequately to allow us to really care about them.At 130 minutes the film seems to drag and to lack attention to character development, but it is a visual treat.  The ingredients are all here but somehow the cake didn't rise. As with Dickens' novel, Oliver Twist needs to tug at our hearts: this one just doesn't.

As another reviewer noted, Monks & Mrs. Corney have been eliminated from this screen version, as have been Mrs. Bumble, Doctor Losberne, Harry Maylie, Mrs. Maylie and my favourite character from the book, Rose Maylie.

954491,A28ILXH590CMRJ,B000C20VU0,Hazen B Markoe,"[66, 75]","Ever since Charles Dickens first penned OLIVER TWIST in 1837, no one ever thought that this sentimental tale of an orphan boy bounced between a gang of thieves and all-too-often uncaring London society would be the classic that it is today.  Soon, however, its wealth of rich and eccentric characters would capture the imagination of both readers and filmmakers alike.  By now, most everyone is familiar with the story of Oliver Twist, an orphan who is brutalized in the Poorhouse system of Victorian London.  Eventually, while escaping his tragic circumstances, he inadvertently falls in with the roguish Fagin and his band of young pickpockets. Feeling sorry for him, one of the gang, Nancy, will help the boy find his loving family, at the cost of her own life. There have probably been at least 19 film and television adaptations of this story, with the stand outs being the 1948 David Lean version and the 1968 musical OLIVER!  Noted and controversial director Roman Polanski now tries his hand at the oft-told tale, with his efforts resulting in a good, but far from definitive, adaptation.For starters, the film is basically a bare bones version of the story, with many of its wonderful characters and dramatic plotlines either shortened or cut completely.  For example, gone are such fantastic characters as Oliver's evil half-brother Monks, as well as the harridan-like Widow Corney.  Also gone is the entire plotline linking Oliver to his past.  As a result of such tinkering, the film tends to drag in parts during its basically two hour running time.On the other hand, there are also many things to enjoy as well.  While he might lack the sparkle and grandness that Alec Guinness and Ron Moody brought to the role, Ben Kingsley makes for a credible and sympathetic Fagin.  Kingsley plays the role with a soft voice and manner, highlighting the emphasis of Fagin as a warped, yet somehow endearing, father figure to young Oliver.  As the title character, Barney Clark is a perfect example of wide-eyed innocence, without being overly cute.Edward Hardwicke, best known to PBS viewers as Dr. Watson in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series, brings warmth and steel to the role of the kindly Mr. Brownlow.  Harry Eden is stellar, but doesn't get nearly enough screen time, as the Artful Dodger, while Jamie Foreman is appropriately brutish at the vicious Bill Sykes.  Alun Armstrong and Mark Strong make vivid impressions in smaller roles.  Special note must be taken of Leanne Rowe's heart-rending portrayal of the tragic Nancy.  Rowe brings a wonderful combination of lost innocence and hard living to the role.  Visually, the film is a treat for the eyes with rich colors contrasting with the dark and dingy world of Fagin's gang.  Rachel Portman's music also solidly adds to the atmosphere of the film.In the end, Polanski succeeds in creating a movie that, while it is a solid version, falls somewhat short of the more classic film versions of the Dickens novel.  Still, this is still a film worth recommending.",4,"Polanski presents an honorable, but not definitive, version of TWIST",1128384000,"10 4, 2005",2005,3026,"['Ever', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'first', 'penned', 'OLIVER', 'TWIST', '1837', 'one', 'ever', 'thought', 'sentimental', 'tale', 'orphan', 'boy', 'bounced', 'gang', 'thieves', 'all-too-often', 'uncaring', 'London', 'society', 'would', 'be', 'classic', 'today', 'Soon', 'however', 'wealth', 'rich', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'would', 'capture', 'imagination', 'readers', 'filmmakers', 'alike', 'now', 'most', 'everyone', 'familiar', 'story', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'orphan', 'who', 'brutalized', 'Poorhouse', 'system', 'Victorian', 'London', 'Eventually', 'escaping', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'inadvertently', 'roguish', 'Fagin', 'band', 'young', 'pickpockets', 'Feeling', 'sorry', 'one', 'gang', 'Nancy', 'will', 'help', 'boy', 'find', 'loving', 'family', 'cost', 'own', 'life', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'least', '19', 'film', 'television', 'adaptations', 'story', 'stand', 'being', '1948', 'David', 'Lean', 'version', '1968', 'musical', 'OLIVER', 'Noted', 'controversial', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'now', 'hand', 'oft-told', 'tale', 'efforts', 'resulting', 'good', 'far', 'definitive', 'adaptation.For', 'starters', 'film', 'basically', 'bare', 'version', 'story', 'many', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'dramatic', 'plotlines', 'shortened', 'cut', 'completely', 'example', 'gone', 'are', 'such', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'Oliver', 'evil', 'half-brother', 'Monks', 'as', 'well', 'harridan-like', 'Widow', 'Corney', 'Also', 'gone', 'entire', 'plotline', 'linking', 'Oliver', 'past', 'result', 'such', 'tinkering', 'film', 'drag', 'parts', 'basically', 'two', 'hour', 'running', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'things', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'lack', 'sparkle', 'grandness', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Ron', 'Moody', 'brought', 'role', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'credible', 'sympathetic', 'Fagin', 'Kingsley', 'role', 'soft', 'voice', 'manner', 'highlighting', 'emphasis', 'Fagin', 'warped', 'somehow', 'endearing', 'father', 'figure', 'young', 'Oliver', 'title', 'character', 'Barney', 'Clark', 'perfect', 'example', 'wide-eyed', 'innocence', 'being', 'overly', 'cute.Edward', 'Hardwicke', 'best', 'known', 'PBS', 'viewers', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'series', 'warmth', 'steel', 'role', 'kindly', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'Harry', 'Eden', 'stellar', ""n't"", 'get', 'nearly', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'Jamie', 'Foreman', 'appropriately', 'brutish', 'vicious', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'make', 'vivid', 'impressions', 'smaller', 'roles', 'Special', 'note', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'Leanne', 'Rowe', 'heart-rending', 'portrayal', 'tragic', 'Nancy', 'Rowe', 'wonderful', 'combination', 'lost', 'innocence', 'hard', 'living', 'role', 'Visually', 'film', 'treat', 'eyes', 'rich', 'colors', 'contrasting', 'dark', 'dingy', 'world', 'Fagin', 'gang', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'music', 'also', 'solidly', 'atmosphere', 'film.In', 'end', 'Polanski', 'creating', 'movie', 'solid', 'version', 'somewhat', 'short', 'more', 'classic', 'film', 'versions', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'Still', 'still', 'film', 'recommending']",N/A

954493,A7PZZXJJZM4N2,B000C20VU0,Isaac,"[26, 27]","Little Oliver Twist (Barney Clark) stands up after finishing his bowl of gruel, meekly approaches the grumpy dining supervisor, and asks timidly, ""Please, sir, I want some more."" Only the opening line of ""A Tale of Two Cities"" is more recognizable in the world of Charles Dickens, but it is this line that reminds us of a character's inherent innocence, and how he is doomed to live a childhood of cruel inferiority.Dickens' Oliver Twist has endured several film adaptations. One was a musical, another was an animated Disney feature, but none of them can hold a candle to Roman Polanski's masterstroke version. Either this is the purest and most timeless Dickens tale or Polanski is one of the greatest directors of our time, and, in case you want to know my opinion, I believe both to be true. With Oliver Twist, Dickens discovered his true writing style, creating a boy hero stuck in a world of detailed and colorful characters. In the film, Polanski paints a beautiful portrait of the world that Oliver inhabits, and it is undoubtedly the world that Dickens had in mind.Its no secret that Dickens is one of the most talked about authors of literature. He himself grew up on the brink of poverty. One can logically conclude that he was mistreated by grown-ups, and one can also logically conclude that he developed a hatred for the upper-class. In most of his stories, the heroes, usually children, are abused and mistreated by snobbish, ignorant adults, and most of these adults are very wealthy; even Tiny Tim was inevitably at the mercy of Scrooge's stinginess. I think that Oliver Twist is the character that Dickens most identified with. The fact that he is one of the great heroes of literature gives the film a good reason to be of the highest order, because without a character that we can have sympathy for, a film is destined to fall dead in the water.But since the book is such an immortal classic, Polanski's vision is destined to be, as well. The screenplay is disposable, I think; its transferring the screenplay to the screen that's the trick. We are given the story of a pitiful orphan boy who is struggling to survive at a time in which children are horrifically treated. He sees the world with his young eyes, and it is a world of vivid characters who are either his friends or enemies. Pretty much the only people who are kind to Oliver are those who break the law.That would be Fagin (an unrecognizable Ben Kingsley), a grotesque but kind-hearted old man who runs a gang of young pickpockets. Oliver meets him through the Artful Dodger (Harry Eden) upon arriving in London, and begins to learn the tricks of stealing. After developing a bond with the boys, and the beautiful Nancy (Leanne Rowe), Oliver becomes caught in misunderstanding that sets off a chain reaction plot.A pickpocketing goes awry and Oliver is arrested but pardoned by the man who was robbed, Mr. Brownlow (Edward Hardwicke), the only wealthy man in the story that Dickens doesn't antagonize. He takes Oliver into his home, treats him with proper medical care and every luxury that he desires, and offers to give Oliver a proper education. But there is a dark shadow surrounding the boy hero, for the evil Bill Sykes (Jamie Forman), is out to use the boy as a pawn in a crime that eventually threatens Oliver's life.Morality is an issue that Dickens so often explored, and both the book and the film solemnly argue that Fagin and his thieves are struggling for survival. 1850s London was a time in which the poor were treated unfairly by the government and the wealthy. So stealing food and money is necessary for Fagin and the boys. But is it still a crime or is it a justified way of life?""Oliver Twist"" brings this concept to life in an array of brilliance. There are many things about the film that are wonderful--the screenplay, the performances--but the film's ultimate triumph is offering a vision much like the one we materialize in our imaginations when we read the book. The characters are on display for the purposes of dragging the story along, but instead they carry it, and they are all played by actors and actresses who hit all the right notes. Barney Clark is the perfect Oliver. Ben Kingsley is a delightful Fagin, who is eventually exploited as a good man on the verge of becoming evil. Jamie Foreman is easily the scariest and most sinister Bill Sykes ever, and he seems to present an additional cruelty that Dickens did not create.Everything about the film is display and conformation. We can imagine Charles Dickens falling in love the characters he created and concluding that these are those characters. In a year in which the Star Wars series has ended in a blaze of perfection, and when cinematic mediocrities can snatch six bucks from your wallet, here is a graceful movie that has a passion for its source material and never, not for a moment, loses an ounce of its potential greatness. What an extraordinary film. - IsaacRated PG-13; 130 minutes; Directed by Roman Polanski",5,Oliver Twist,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,4995,"['Little', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'Barney', 'Clark', 'up', 'finishing', 'bowl', 'gruel', 'meekly', 'grumpy', 'dining', 'supervisor', 'timidly', 'Please', 'sir', 'want', 'more', 'Only', 'opening', 'line', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Cities', 'more', 'recognizable', 'world', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'line', 'character', 'inherent', 'innocence', 'how', 'doomed', 'live', 'childhood', 'cruel', 'inferiority.Dickens', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'endured', 'several', 'film', 'adaptations', 'One', 'was', 'musical', 'was', 'animated', 'Disney', 'feature', 'none', 'can', 'hold', 'candle', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'masterstroke', 'version', 'purest', 'most', 'timeless', 'Dickens', 'tale', 'Polanski', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'time', 'case', 'want', 'know', 'opinion', 'believe', 'be', 'true', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'Dickens', 'discovered', 'true', 'writing', 'style', 'creating', 'boy', 'hero', 'stuck', 'world', 'detailed', 'colorful', 'characters', 'film', 'Polanski', 'beautiful', 'portrait', 'world', 'Oliver', 'undoubtedly', 'world', 'had', 'mind.Its', 'secret', 'Dickens', 'one', 'most', 'talked', 'authors', 'literature', 'grew', 'up', 'brink', 'poverty', 'One', 'can', 'logically', 'conclude', 'was', 'mistreated', 'grown-ups', 'one', 'can', 'also', 'logically', 'conclude', 'developed', 'hatred', 'upper-class', 'most', 'stories', 'heroes', 'usually', 'children', 'are', 'abused', 'mistreated', 'snobbish', 'ignorant', 'adults', 'most', 'adults', 'are', 'very', 'wealthy', 'even', 'Tiny', 'Tim', 'was', 'inevitably', 'mercy', 'Scrooge', 'stinginess', 'think', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'character', 'most', 'identified', 'fact', 'one', 'great', 'heroes', 'literature', 'film', 'good', 'reason', 'be', 'highest', 'order', 'character', 'can', 'have', 'sympathy', 'film', 'destined', 'fall', 'dead', 'water.But', 'book', 'such', 'immortal', 'classic', 'Polanski', 'vision', 'destined', 'be', 'well', 'screenplay', 'disposable', 'think', 'transferring', 'screenplay', 'screen', 'trick', 'are', 'given', 'story', 'pitiful', 'orphan', 'boy', 'who', 'struggling', 'survive', 'time', 'children', 'are', 'horrifically', 'treated', 'world', 'young', 'eyes', 'world', 'vivid', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'friends', 'enemies', 'Pretty', 'much', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'kind', 'Oliver', 'are', 'who', 'break', 'law.That', 'would', 'be', 'Fagin', 'unrecognizable', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'grotesque', 'kind-hearted', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'gang', 'young', 'pickpockets', 'Oliver', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'Harry', 'Eden', 'arriving', 'London', 'learn', 'tricks', 'stealing', 'developing', 'bond', 'boys', 'beautiful', 'Nancy', 'Leanne', 'Rowe', 'Oliver', 'caught', 'misunderstanding', 'off', 'chain', 'reaction', 'plot.A', 'pickpocketing', 'awry', 'Oliver', 'arrested', 'pardoned', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'robbed', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'Edward', 'Hardwicke', 'only', 'wealthy', 'man', 'story', 'Dickens', ""n't"", 'antagonize', 'Oliver', 'home', 'proper', 'medical', 'care', 'luxury', 'give', 'Oliver', 'proper', 'education', 'dark', 'shadow', 'surrounding', 'boy', 'hero', 'evil', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'Jamie', 'Forman', 'out', 'use', 'boy', 'pawn', 'crime', 'eventually', 'Oliver', 'life.Morality', 'issue', 'so', 'often', 'explored', 'book', 'film', 'solemnly', 'Fagin', 'thieves', 'are', 'struggling', 'survival', '1850s', 'London', 'was', 'time', 'poor', 'were', 'treated', 'unfairly', 'government', 'wealthy', 'So', 'stealing', 'food', 'money', 'necessary', 'Fagin', 'boys', 'still', 'crime', 'justified', 'way', 'life', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'concept', 'life', 'array', 'brilliance', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'wonderful', 'screenplay', 'performances', 'film', 'ultimate', 'triumph', 'offering', 'vision', 'much', 'one', 'materialize', 'imaginations', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'characters', 'are', 'display', 'purposes', 'dragging', 'story', 'instead', 'carry', 'are', 'played', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'Barney', 'Clark', 'perfect', 'Oliver', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'delightful', 'Fagin', 'who', 'eventually', 'exploited', 'good', 'man', 'verge', 'becoming', 'evil', 'Jamie', 'Foreman', 'easily', 'scariest', 'most', 'sinister', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'ever', 'present', 'additional', 'cruelty', 'did', 'not', 'create.Everything', 'film', 'display', 'conformation', 'can', 'imagine', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'falling', 'love', 'characters', 'created', 'concluding', 'are', 'characters', 'year', 'Star', 'Wars', 'series', 'ended', 'blaze', 'perfection', 'when', 'cinematic', 'mediocrities', 'can', 'snatch', 'six', 'bucks', 'wallet', 'here', 'graceful', 'movie', 'passion', 'source', 'material', 'never', 'not', 'moment', 'ounce', 'potential', 'greatness', 'What', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'IsaacRated', 'PG-13', '130', 'minutes', 'Directed', 'Roman', 'Polanski']",N/A

And you would be wrong. But what can it bring that could be new on a subject we all know since this book and this story are classics that everyone knows and that are even at times kind of over-repeated. Roman Polanski decides to renew the treatment of the theme by using the fact that we know all major events and episodes by going as fast as possible on the core of the episodes and insisting on what is around, before or after. If the episode is hard, like Nancy's death, he uses an ellipse that shortens it. If the episode is over-known, like the begging for more porridge, he centers the scene on the drawing of who is going to volunteer, and then on what comes before and follows. That enables Polanski to avoid melodrama and a sentimentalese treatment and to concentrate on the human side of things. He is helped in his attempt by the admirable acting of Ben Kingsley as Fagan. Of course Polanski cannot bring anything new on the subject and he concentrates on the pictorial and plastic beauty of this color adaptation and on the extreme sincerity of the actors, good or evil. But is it able to erase the unforgettable post-war black and white adaptation in our memory? Probably not, but they are so different that they don't compete.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,Polanski prefers beauty to sentimentality,1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,1480,"['recent', 'adaptation', 'Dickens', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'long', 'long', 'series', 'would', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'what', 'can', 'bring', 'could', 'be', 'new', 'subject', 'know', 'book', 'story', 'are', 'classics', 'everyone', 'knows', 'are', 'even', 'times', 'kind', 'over-repeated', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'renew', 'treatment', 'theme', 'using', 'fact', 'know', 'major', 'events', 'episodes', 'going', 'as', 'fast', 'possible', 'core', 'episodes', 'insisting', 'what', 'around', 'episode', 'hard', 'Nancy', 'death', 'ellipse', 'episode', 'over-known', 'begging', 'more', 'porridge', 'scene', 'drawing', 'who', 'going', 'volunteer', 'then', 'what', 'before', 'Polanski', 'avoid', 'melodrama', 'sentimentalese', 'treatment', 'concentrate', 'human', 'side', 'things', 'helped', 'attempt', 'admirable', 'acting', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Fagan', 'course', 'Polanski', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'subject', 'pictorial', 'plastic', 'beauty', 'color', 'adaptation', 'extreme', 'sincerity', 'actors', 'good', 'evil', 'able', 'erase', 'unforgettable', 'post-war', 'black', 'white', 'adaptation', 'memory', 'Probably', 'not', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'compete.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

954496,A96AUNSF6GESO,B000C20VU0,Janeite,"[0, 0]","Having been a huge Dickens fan for as long as I can remember, I enjoy seeing all the film versions of his novels whenever I can. I just found this one on my cable company's On Demand menu and watched it with my husband. I know the story quite well although I haven't re-read the novel in quite a few years, but my husband says he's never read it or seen any film adaptation of it at all. His opinion of the movie would have been to rate it with 5 stars, but I withhold the highest rank from it for a few relatively minor things that my husband, not being familiar with the story to begin with, didn't even notice. First off, many of the novel's characters and storylines have been pruned away, leaving a pretty bare-bones version of the tale. This causes the movie to go along at a steady pace that allows it to fit into a two hour running time, but it robs the story of much of its richness. Not only are we missing some interesting characters, but some of the plot lines, such as the one involving the orphan Oliver's discoveries about his heritage, leave a rather gaping hole in the story when they are absent. Related to this point is the fact that character development seems sorely lacking. The characters are all quite uni-dimensional (though I'm not sure that's a real word; sorry) and lacking in depth. Bill Sykes, for example, is just your basic evil person, selfish and violent with nary a shred of humanity in evidence. The relationships between Oliver and Mr. Brownlow and between Oliver and Nancy fail to show any dimensions or depth at all, and this takes away a good bit from the story as a whole. Without seeing how or why Nancy and Brownlow respond so keenly to Oliver, the viewer can't discern the motivations of their characters very well.  The decision seems to have been made to remove much of the melodrama and overt coincidence from the story, which makes it more realistic but less colorful. Many scenes which smack of melodrama and seem designed to wrench tears from the audience have been tidied up in such a way as to make them seem more likely to have happened, in a purely literal way, less sensational, but also minimizes their impact. The movie has a great &#34;look&#34; to it with wonderful costumes, sets, and digital imagery that give the movie a wonderful sense of time and place. Along with this sense of verisimilitude, most of the acting is likewise quite realistic. The only, rather glaring, exception, is the character of a burglar, played by Mark Strong in garishly-colored garb and Ronald McDonald hair. He seems like a cartoon walking around amongst the other, more downplayed, less caricature-like characters. That  being said, most of the acting is subdued and well-done, with standouts being those actors portraying the Artful Dodger and Nancy. Ben Kingsley rarely disappoints, and his Fagin is both subtle and sympathetic. He shows that he is capable of kindness and affection, but in the end he fails to rise above his own motive of self-preservation. In particular, Fagin's final scene is probably the film's finest, being moving without succumbing to heavy melodrama. This version did a great job of focusing on how the characters' reaction, or failure to react, to Oliver's overwhelming youth, innocence, and naivete can be their salvation or their damnation. People respond to Oliver's helplessness in two basic ways: either they want to protect him or take advantage of him. The movie clearly shows the result of each reaction. While sympathy for Oliver may lead a person into danger, it ultimately gives him or her the opportunity for compassion and humanity to overcome baser motivations. After watching the film, my husband and I had a terrific conversation about this being one possible theme of the novel. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for an entertaining and thoughtful rendition of Oliver Twist just so long as they realize that much of the novel's richness of detail is absent from this film.",4,A Solid Interpretation,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,3972,"['Having', 'been', 'huge', 'Dickens', 'fan', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'film', 'versions', 'novels', 'whenever', 'can', 'just', 'found', 'one', 'cable', 'company', 'Demand', 'menu', 'watched', 'husband', 'know', 'story', 'quite', 'well', 'have', ""n't"", 're-read', 'novel', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'husband', 'never', 'read', 'seen', 'film', 'adaptation', 'opinion', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rate', '5', 'stars', 'withhold', 'highest', 'rank', 'few', 'relatively', 'minor', 'things', 'husband', 'not', 'being', 'familiar', 'story', 'begin', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'First', 'many', 'novel', 'characters', 'storylines', 'have', 'been', 'pruned', 'away', 'leaving', 'pretty', 'bare-bones', 'version', 'tale', 'movie', 'go', 'along', 'steady', 'pace', 'fit', 'two', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'story', 'much', 'richness', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'missing', 'interesting', 'characters', 'plot', 'lines', 'such', 'one', 'involving', 'orphan', 'Oliver', 'discoveries', 'heritage', 'leave', 'rather', 'gaping', 'hole', 'story', 'when', 'are', 'absent', 'Related', 'point', 'fact', 'character', 'development', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'uni-dimensional', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'real', 'word', 'lacking', 'depth', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'example', 'just', 'basic', 'evil', 'person', 'selfish', 'violent', 'nary', 'shred', 'humanity', 'evidence', 'relationships', 'Oliver', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'Oliver', 'Nancy', 'fail', 'show', 'dimensions', 'depth', 'away', 'good', 'bit', 'story', 'whole', 'seeing', 'how', 'why', 'Nancy', 'Brownlow', 'respond', 'so', 'keenly', 'Oliver', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'discern', 'motivations', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'decision', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'remove', 'much', 'melodrama', 'overt', 'coincidence', 'story', 'more', 'realistic', 'less', 'colorful', 'Many', 'scenes', 'smack', 'melodrama', 'seem', 'designed', 'wrench', 'tears', 'audience', 'have', 'been', 'tidied', 'up', 'such', 'way', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'likely', 'have', 'happened', 'purely', 'literal', 'way', 'less', 'sensational', 'also', 'impact', 'movie', 'great', '34', 'look', '34', 'wonderful', 'costumes', 'sets', 'digital', 'imagery', 'give', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'sense', 'verisimilitude', 'most', 'acting', 'likewise', 'quite', 'realistic', 'only', 'rather', 'glaring', 'exception', 'character', 'burglar', 'played', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'garishly-colored', 'garb', 'Ronald', 'McDonald', 'hair', 'cartoon', 'walking', 'around', 'other', 'more', 'downplayed', 'less', 'caricature-like', 'characters', 'being', 'said', 'most', 'acting', 'subdued', 'well-done', 'standouts', 'being', 'actors', 'portraying', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'Nancy', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'rarely', 'Fagin', 'subtle', 'sympathetic', 'capable', 'kindness', 'affection', 'end', 'rise', 'own', 'motive', 'self-preservation', 'particular', 'Fagin', 'final', 'scene', 'probably', 'film', 'finest', 'being', 'moving', 'succumbing', 'heavy', 'melodrama', 'version', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'focusing', 'how', 'characters', 'reaction', 'failure', 'react', 'Oliver', 'overwhelming', 'youth', 'innocence', 'naivete', 'can', 'be', 'salvation', 'damnation', 'People', 'respond', 'Oliver', 'helplessness', 'two', 'basic', 'ways', 'want', 'protect', 'take', 'advantage', 'movie', 'clearly', 'result', 'reaction', 'sympathy', 'Oliver', 'may', 'lead', 'person', 'danger', 'ultimately', 'opportunity', 'compassion', 'humanity', 'overcome', 'baser', 'motivations', 'watching', 'film', 'husband', 'had', 'terrific', 'conversation', 'being', 'one', 'possible', 'theme', 'novel', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'looking', 'entertaining', 'thoughtful', 'rendition', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'just', 'so', 'long', 'realize', 'much', 'novel', 'richness', 'detail', 'absent', 'film']",N/A

954500,A2B9WOSXCU7LDM,B000C20VU0,"Jordan ""brainofj72""","[3, 5]","When I first heard Roman Polanski was going to make Oliver Twist his next project, I found it curious. Why would he go from The Pianist in 2002, a harrowing, realistic account of Holocaust horrors, to Oliver Twist, something of an uplifting, child-friendly story, three years later? Did he just want to lighten up and take a breather? He says he wanted to make a film his children could relate to. This makes Oliver Twist, the film, seem more and more curious to me. Because Polanski's Oliver Twist is a very dark and very deep film.We all know the story - an orphan boy tries to escape a life of dreadful torment and winds up in a gang of young pickpockets, lead by a flamboyant old man named Fagin.Now, I have not read Charles Dickens' novel, so I cannot critique Oliver Twist as an adaptation. However, the film is so delicate and emotional that I feel it transcends any critiques on adaptation accuracy. This film is not a lighthearted fairy tale, but a beautiful drama crafted by an experienced master of cinema.First of all, Polanski has a gift for getting great performances out of his actors. The most striking performance in Twist is delivered by Ben Kingsley, whom Polanski extracted such a terrific performance from eleven years prior in Death and The Maiden. He exhibits such a charming and exuberant nature, you can't help but feel a certain fondness for him, no matter how sinister he may seem at times. He's just a loveable old man. Jamie Foreman does a great job as Bill Sykes, creating one of the most menacing and easily hate-able villains I've ever seen. Barney Clark does a pretty good job for a child actor. He's never irritating and pulls off the introspective, passive nature of the character quite well. The rest of the cast is fairly strong all around, as well.I could go on and on about how Oliver Twist is masterfully lit and how well the cinematography works, but it rises above technical critiques. I felt such a consistently overwhelming string of emotions while viewing it that I find it difficult to compose this review. The film made me feel uplifted and hopeful before devastating me with disappointment, and then did it all again and again and again, and that, to me, is a remarkable feat. (On a side note, I would also like to add that this is all underscored wonderfully by Rachel Portman's excellent score.)And this is just one way in which Polanski is a true master of cinematic perspective. The viewer experiences every emotion that Oliver experiences, and Polanski does it not through gimmicks or manipulation, but through what is shown and not shown. When Oliver is torn away from what could prove to be a loving household, which he has never experienced, he is left with a terrible feeling of guilt and fear. Fear not of what is going to happen to him, but of what his wonderful almost-parents will think of him. The viewer never sees their reaction, but is left with an unbearable sense of not knowing. It's like a punch to the gut, and it hurts.In a lot of ways, Oliver Twist is a surprisingly logical progression from The Pianist. Both are films that examine the best and worst elements of humanity, and ultimately portray a message of hope. While The Pianist used the real-life horror of The Holocaust to convey this, Oliver Twist uses a fictional 19th Century England. Polanski uses moments of horrible cruelty (including a particularly hard to watch scene of incredibly brutal violence) and moments of nearly inexplicable kindness and decency to create a poignant tapestry of humanity and all that it is capable of. He even does it, at times, with a simple juxtaposition of imagery. Just brilliant.Oliver Twist is a gorgeous, moving, and enlightened masterpiece from a seasoned director who knows exactly what he wants and how to achieve it. Roman Polanski is one of the true masters of the motion picture, and if Oliver Twist does prove to be his last film, it is an unexpectedly strong note to go out on.",5,A Moving Masterpiece From An Amazing Filmmaker,1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,3955,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'next', 'project', 'found', 'curious', 'Why', 'would', 'go', 'Pianist', '2002', 'harrowing', 'realistic', 'account', 'Holocaust', 'horrors', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'something', 'uplifting', 'child-friendly', 'story', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'Did', 'just', 'want', 'lighten', 'up', 'take', 'breather', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'children', 'could', 'relate', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'more', 'curious', 'Polanski', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'very', 'dark', 'very', 'deep', 'film.We', 'know', 'story', 'orphan', 'boy', 'tries', 'escape', 'life', 'dreadful', 'torment', 'up', 'gang', 'young', 'pickpockets', 'lead', 'flamboyant', 'old', 'man', 'named', 'Fagin.Now', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'can', 'not', 'critique', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'adaptation', 'However', 'film', 'so', 'delicate', 'emotional', 'feel', 'critiques', 'adaptation', 'accuracy', 'film', 'not', 'lighthearted', 'fairy', 'tale', 'beautiful', 'drama', 'crafted', 'experienced', 'master', 'cinema.First', 'Polanski', 'gift', 'getting', 'great', 'performances', 'actors', 'most', 'striking', 'performance', 'Twist', 'delivered', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'whom', 'Polanski', 'extracted', 'terrific', 'performance', 'eleven', 'years', 'prior', 'Death', 'Maiden', 'charming', 'exuberant', 'nature', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'certain', 'fondness', 'matter', 'how', 'sinister', 'may', 'seem', 'times', 'just', 'loveable', 'old', 'man', 'Jamie', 'Foreman', 'great', 'job', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'creating', 'one', 'most', 'menacing', 'easily', 'hate-able', 'villains', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Barney', 'Clark', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'child', 'actor', 'never', 'irritating', 'off', 'introspective', 'passive', 'nature', 'character', 'quite', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'fairly', 'strong', 'around', 'well.I', 'could', 'go', 'how', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'masterfully', 'lit', 'how', 'well', 'cinematography', 'technical', 'critiques', 'felt', 'consistently', 'overwhelming', 'string', 'emotions', 'viewing', 'find', 'difficult', 'compose', 'review', 'film', 'made', 'feel', 'uplifted', 'hopeful', 'devastating', 'disappointment', 'then', 'did', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'remarkable', 'feat', 'side', 'note', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'add', 'underscored', 'wonderfully', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'excellent', 'score', 'just', 'one', 'way', 'Polanski', 'true', 'master', 'cinematic', 'perspective', 'viewer', 'emotion', 'Oliver', 'experiences', 'Polanski', 'not', 'gimmicks', 'manipulation', 'what', 'shown', 'not', 'shown', 'When', 'Oliver', 'torn', 'away', 'what', 'could', 'prove', 'be', 'loving', 'household', 'never', 'experienced', 'left', 'terrible', 'feeling', 'guilt', 'fear', 'Fear', 'not', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'what', 'wonderful', 'almost-parents', 'will', 'think', 'viewer', 'never', 'reaction', 'left', 'unbearable', 'sense', 'not', 'knowing', 'punch', 'gut', 'lot', 'ways', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'surprisingly', 'logical', 'progression', 'Pianist', 'are', 'films', 'examine', 'best', 'worst', 'elements', 'humanity', 'ultimately', 'portray', 'message', 'hope', 'Pianist', 'used', 'real-life', 'horror', 'Holocaust', 'convey', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'fictional', '19th', 'Century', 'England', 'Polanski', 'moments', 'horrible', 'cruelty', 'including', 'particularly', 'hard', 'watch', 'scene', 'incredibly', 'brutal', 'violence', 'moments', 'nearly', 'inexplicable', 'kindness', 'decency', 'create', 'poignant', 'tapestry', 'humanity', 'capable', 'even', 'times', 'simple', 'juxtaposition', 'imagery', 'Just', 'brilliant.Oliver', 'Twist', 'gorgeous', 'moving', 'enlightened', 'masterpiece', 'seasoned', 'director', 'who', 'exactly', 'what', 'how', 'achieve', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'one', 'true', 'masters', 'motion', 'picture', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'prove', 'be', 'last', 'film', 'unexpectedly', 'strong', 'note', 'go', 'out']",N/A

954504,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000C20VU0,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 2]","Does the audience need another cinematic adaptation of the great novel Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens?  There has already been great ones such a David Lean's version from 1948 where Alec Guinness provides a brilliant portrayal of the villain Fagin.  Then there is the silent masterpiece of Oliver Twist that Frank Lloyd directed in 1922 while Oliver Twist that also received a unique musical treatment directed by Carol Reed in 1968.  At first thought, maybe no, but after some deliberation in Roman Polanski's perspective, I must say yes.  The audience definitely needs to see Polanski's version of the legendary tale of the orphan Oliver Twist.There are significant parallels between the director Roman Polanski's childhood and the fictional character Oliver Twist's upbringing.  Both faced brutality and injustice while being completely dependent on others for their survival amidst a time of great difficulty.  The story of Oliver Twist does not need much explanation here, however, to understand Polanski's version one should understand his upbringing at the age of ten.  Polanski was born in Paris, but his parents moved back to Poland in 1937.  Six years later, Polanski had reached the age of ten and he had to evade the Nazis after his parent's apprehension.  His escape brought him from the Krakow Ghetto to the Polish countryside where he most likely survived with the help of strangers that probably exploited the situation.The beauty of Polanski's Oliver Twist is that he captures Dickens' social criticism of the time while also making use of the opportunity to display society's impact on countless orphan youths.  Just as Polanski prematurely tests his own wings, many others faced life alone without the protection of parents, in this case Oliver Twist (Barney Clark).  In situations such as these, children are extremely susceptible to the actions of others, which often have life long consequences for the children.  Nonetheless, on rare occasions a few sunflower children emerge with strong enough character to resist the corrupting evils.  In this case, Oliver's innocence helps protect his virtue, which the audience learns more about as the film unfolds.  However, the film presents another interesting notion, how does the orphan upbringing affect the child once they have entered adulthood?In the opening, it is evident that the obese gentlemen that runs the orphanage exploits the young children to pad his own fat and wallet while the children find themselves dreamless in hunger.  The worst thing with these men is that they have the law and religion on their side, but it is to be expected, as these men seem to be the ones that influence the moral code in their favor.  It is much like a despotic micro society. Later, Fagin (Ben Kingsley) tries to deceive Oliver that his trade, theft, is an honorable trade.  Yet, one could not deny that Fagin's assistance is far healthier than the legal oppression of the children that the orphanage poses on the children.  With Fagin, the children learn how to stand on their own legs, but do so without consideration of others.  Then there is the vicious Bill Sykes (Jamie Foreman) who uses children as tools for personal gain without regard to their safety or well-being.  These three steps, from the orphanage to Sykes, provides an intriguing notion of how many children are fostered when they seek the streets and what happens to them when love and affection is not nurtured for them.Polanski also portrays Dickens' version the judicial system where the judge throws judgment upon people without consideration of humanity, compassion, and fairness.  The film illustrates society's callous machinery that affects the lives of children and the future of a nation. Polanski goes so far to provide the notion that the innocence of children is what the society should be embracing, as it does not hate or cause bedlam.  Oliver's innocence turns out to be a source of goodness, which society tends to ridicule due to its nave perspective of the world.  However, it also raises the idea that what one does not know, one could not do.  This emerges strongly in the scene where Artful Dodger (Harry Eden) and the thuggish kids point out Oliver's ""green"" character.All of the characters in Oliver Twist have all once been innocent children including the rich men at the orphanage, Fagin, and Sykes.  Along these men's upbringing, they have changed their innocence to rough and uncaring characters in order to survive, or make life better for themselves.  Some has been more fortunate and learned how to share and love such as Mr. Brownlow (Edward Hardwicke) whose kindness does not know limits, as the audience learns in the film.  Unfortunately, the audience never learns what happens to Oliver when he grows old, but most likely, something good happened to him.  However, the audience has the fortune to view Polanski as an adult, and the events through his life.  Some of his choices have not been exemplary, and the ending maybe tosses some light on how Polanski feels himself.  Thus, Polanski's film presents an intriguing cinematic perspective on Oliver Twist with a strong personal touch where Polanski exorcises his own demons from his past.",5,Another Marvelous Twist on

954505,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000C20VU0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","One of the things that made the movie version of the musical ""Oliver!"" work was that when they were not singing everybody was playing their characters like they were in a regular drama (although it helped that Alan Bates' memorable turn as Bill Sykes was done without him singing his song, ""My Name"").  So Roman Polanski returning to the novel by Charles Dickens seems like a no-brainer, even if you do not know that when the director was the same age as the 10-year-old Oliver, he was orphaned by the Holocaust.  The parallels between the Nazi death camps and the workhouse of Dickensian London are rather obvious, and while most horrors pale against the Holocaust, there is something odious about the way the British upper class treated the lower class (i.e., they were enlightened people who you think should have known better).The story is of the orphaned Oliver Twist (Barney Clark) who is sold from the workhouse for daring to ask for more gruel and finally escapes from this life and heads to the metropolis of London.  There he meets the Artful Dodger (Harry Eden), a pickpocket, who takes Oliver to the lair of Fagin (Ben Kinglsey), who teaches young boys to steal.  However, chance puts Oliver in the care of the kindly Mr. Brownlow (Edward Hardwicke), but the vicious Bill Sykes (Jamie Foreman) considers the boy to be a loose end that has to be tied up and Oliver's life is put into danger.The look of this 2005 production of ""Oliver Twist"" is everything you would hope it to be thanks to cinematographer Pawel Edelman (""The Pianist""), production designer Allan Starski (""Schindler's List""), senior art director Jindrich Koci (""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen""), set decorator Jille Azis (""Gladiator""), and costumer Anna B. Sheppard (""Around the World in 80 Days"").  The cast, with the obvious exception of Kingsley, is full of veteran British character actors where you may recognize the face but not recall the name (chances are you never knew the name of Foreman or Hardwicke to begin with, but the faces should be familiar).  However, all of the roles, with the exception again of Kingsley's Fagin, are rather underplayed by Dickensian standards.  This might be a more realistic approach, but it is hardly more affective.  The most compelling performance is that of Leanne Rowe as Nancy, and that underscores a basic problem because Sykes has to be as evil as Nancy is good, and that is just not the case.In this cinematic version the title character is basically blown around by circumstances.  Except for an unfailing politeness that disappears only when he is half scared to death or is weak from hunger, there is little to recommend Oliver's character.  Like most of the cast, the role is underplayed, and if I did not have my knowledge of the story (originally ingrained by the Classic's Illustrated comic book version that I still possess), I would not be able to fill in the gaps and remember that this is a story of a young boy trying to take control of his life in a cruel and heartless world where kindness is not easily found.Consequently, Polanski's ""Oliver Twist"" has the look, but neither the heart nor the soul of the Dickens' novel.  Maybe Polanski made this film too soon after he did ""The Pianist,"" because the tone is quite similar, but without the net effect.  I think that if you go back and watch ""Oliver!"" and skip (or fast forward) through the songs, that the net effect will still be the musical is a more moving drama.  The other obvious choice, of course, is David Lean's 1948 version of the tale with Alec Guiness as Fagin.  I would say that remains the best adaptation to date, but then I have not seen either the two television movies or two televison mini-series that have been made since ""Oliver!"" came out in 1968 (with George C. Scott, Richard Dreyfuss, Eric Porter and Robert Lindsey as the respective Fagins).  So if this one does not ring true enough for you, there are other possibilities for you to track down to find one that does.",4,"Polanski captures the look, but neither the heart nor the soul of ""Oliver Twist""",1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,3993,"['One', 'things', 'made', 'movie', 'version', 'musical', 'Oliver', 'work', 'was', 'when', 'were', 'not', 'singing', 'everybody', 'was', 'playing', 'characters', 'were', 'regular', 'drama', 'helped', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'memorable', 'turn', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'was', 'done', 'singing', 'song', 'Name', 'So', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'returning', 'novel', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'no-brainer', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'when', 'director', 'was', 'same', 'age', '10-year-old', 'Oliver', 'was', 'orphaned', 'Holocaust', 'parallels', 'Nazi', 'death', 'camps', 'workhouse', 'Dickensian', 'London', 'are', 'rather', 'obvious', 'most', 'horrors', 'pale', 'Holocaust', 'something', 'odious', 'way', 'British', 'upper', 'class', 'treated', 'lower', 'class', 'i.e.', 'were', 'enlightened', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', '.The', 'story', 'orphaned', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'Barney', 'Clark', 'who', 'sold', 'workhouse', 'daring', 'ask', 'more', 'gruel', 'finally', 'life', 'heads', 'metropolis', 'London', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'Harry', 'Eden', 'pickpocket', 'who', 'Oliver', 'lair', 'Fagin', 'Ben', 'Kinglsey', 'who', 'young', 'boys', 'steal', 'However', 'chance', 'puts', 'Oliver', 'care', 'kindly', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'Edward', 'Hardwicke', 'vicious', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'Jamie', 'Foreman', 'boy', 'be', 'loose', 'end', 'be', 'tied', 'up', 'Oliver', 'life', 'put', 'danger.The', 'look', '2005', 'production', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'everything', 'would', 'hope', 'be', 'thanks', 'cinematographer', 'Pawel', 'Edelman', 'Pianist', 'production', 'designer', 'Allan', 'Starski', 'Schindler', 'List', 'senior', 'art', 'director', 'Jindrich', 'Koci', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'set', 'decorator', 'Jille', 'Azis', 'Gladiator', 'costumer', 'Anna', 'B.', 'Sheppard', 'World', '80', 'Days', 'cast', 'obvious', 'exception', 'Kingsley', 'full', 'veteran', 'British', 'character', 'actors', 'where', 'may', 'recognize', 'face', 'not', 'recall', 'name', 'chances', 'are', 'never', 'knew', 'name', 'Foreman', 'Hardwicke', 'begin', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'However', 'roles', 'exception', 'again', 'Kingsley', 'Fagin', 'are', 'rather', 'underplayed', 'Dickensian', 'standards', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'approach', 'hardly', 'more', 'affective', 'most', 'compelling', 'performance', 'Leanne', 'Rowe', 'Nancy', 'basic', 'problem', 'Sykes', 'be', 'as', 'evil', 'Nancy', 'good', 'just', 'not', 'case.In', 'cinematic', 'version', 'title', 'character', 'basically', 'blown', 'around', 'circumstances', 'unfailing', 'politeness', 'only', 'when', 'half', 'scared', 'death', 'weak', 'hunger', 'little', 'recommend', 'Oliver', 'character', 'most', 'cast', 'role', 'underplayed', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'knowledge', 'story', 'originally', 'ingrained', 'Classic', 'Illustrated', 'comic', 'book', 'version', 'still', 'possess', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'fill', 'gaps', 'remember', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'trying', 'take', 'control', 'life', 'cruel', 'heartless', 'world', 'where', 'kindness', 'not', 'easily', 'found.Consequently', 'Polanski', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'look', 'heart', 'soul', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'Maybe', 'Polanski', 'made', 'film', 'too', 'soon', 'did', 'Pianist', 'tone', 'quite', 'similar', 'net', 'effect', 'think', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'Oliver', 'skip', 'fast', 'forward', 'songs', 'net', 'effect', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'musical', 'more', 'moving', 'drama', 'other', 'obvious', 'choice', 'course', 'David', 'Lean', '1948', 'version', 'tale', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'Fagin', 'would', 'say', 'best', 'adaptation', 'date', 'then', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'two', 'television', 'movies', 'two', 'televison', 'mini-series', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Oliver', 'came', 'out', '1968', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'Robert', 'Lindsey', 'respective', 'Fagins', 'So', 'one', 'not', 'ring', 'true', 'enough', 'are', 'other', 'possibilities', 'track', 'down', 'find', 'one']",N/A

Now, if you have read the book and decided you want something closer to the author's novel, Roman Polanski's film adaptation isn't perfect, but it is worth having a look-see.  In fact, I bought mine previously viewed at a video chain store and was mostly impressed with this version regardless of my own negative personal feelings about Polanski in other facets of his life.  It has no bearing on his profession as a good director, and that's what's important.For the sake of avoiding too much time on an already long film, a lot of the subplots in the Dickens novel are cut out here, and a few details of the story are redirected to accommodate that move, but Polanski's version is impressively close to the telling that Dickens would probably give a courteous nod to.Since I've only viewed this version and the musical, comparisons are unavoidable.  Barney Clark is heartbreakingly adorable as the title character, but I prefer Mark Lester's performance just a bit more.  Oliver Reed was the best and most fearsome Bill Sikes of the two, but Ben Kingsley--who really is the big draw in this film--is an outstanding nicer version of Fagin, and actually very comical in an otherwise heavy story.  As for our lady of the evening with the heart of gold, Leanne Rowe was very good, but give me Shanie Wallace over her any day.  Harry Eden is totally cool as the Artful Dodger and carries the role well enough that, though he's not in your face all the time like Jack Wild was in 1968, he makes his presence well known when he doesn't even say a word.What makes this version of Oliver work is Polanski's attention to detail and impressively touching accout due to his own childhood background.  You can feel that he really cares about this story a lot, and he also has great respect for Dickens, which is a big plus.  The extras are also very nice touch.  Diehard Dickens fans may have a problem with this version, but for those of us who've seen too many movies stray far afield from their humble novelesque origins, Polanski's Twist, is a breath of exceedingly rare fresh air.",4,Fairly Good Adaptation of the Dickens Novel.,1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,2263,"['loved', '1968', 'musical', 'classic', 'tale', 'took', 'quite', 'few', 'liberties', 'sake', 'very', 'good', 'musical', 'score', 'quite', 'permissible', 'due', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Now', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'decided', 'want', 'something', 'closer', 'author', 'novel', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'film', 'adaptation', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'worth', 'having', 'look-see', 'fact', 'bought', 'mine', 'previously', 'viewed', 'video', 'chain', 'store', 'was', 'mostly', 'impressed', 'version', 'regardless', 'own', 'negative', 'personal', 'feelings', 'Polanski', 'other', 'facets', 'life', 'bearing', 'profession', 'good', 'director', 'what', 'important.For', 'sake', 'avoiding', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'already', 'long', 'film', 'lot', 'subplots', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'are', 'cut', 'out', 'here', 'few', 'details', 'story', 'are', 'redirected', 'accommodate', 'move', 'Polanski', 'version', 'impressively', 'close', 'telling', 'Dickens', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'courteous', 'nod', 'to.Since', ""'ve"", 'only', 'viewed', 'version', 'musical', 'comparisons', 'are', 'unavoidable', 'Barney', 'Clark', 'heartbreakingly', 'adorable', 'title', 'character', 'prefer', 'Mark', 'Lester', 'performance', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'was', 'best', 'most', 'fearsome', 'Bill', 'Sikes', 'two', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'who', 'really', 'big', 'draw', 'film', 'outstanding', 'nicer', 'version', 'Fagin', 'actually', 'very', 'comical', 'otherwise', 'heavy', 'story', 'lady', 'evening', 'heart', 'gold', 'Leanne', 'Rowe', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'give', 'Shanie', 'Wallace', 'day', 'Harry', 'Eden', 'totally', 'cool', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'role', 'well', 'enough', 'not', 'face', 'time', 'Jack', 'Wild', 'was', '1968', 'presence', 'well', 'known', 'when', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'version', 'Oliver', 'work', 'Polanski', 'attention', 'detail', 'impressively', 'touching', 'accout', 'due', 'own', 'childhood', 'background', 'can', 'feel', 'really', 'story', 'lot', 'also', 'great', 'respect', 'Dickens', 'big', 'plus', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'touch', 'Diehard', 'Dickens', 'fans', 'may', 'have', 'problem', 'version', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'stray', 'far', 'afield', 'humble', 'novelesque', 'origins', 'Polanski', 'Twist', 'breath', 'exceedingly', 'rare', 'fresh', 'air']",N/A

Ben Kingsley turns in a top notch performance as Fagin, the lord of a band of pickpockets, with his bent visage and wizened knowledge.

Polanski has made a technically polished film that conveys a sense of authenticity, but this ""Oliver Twist"" has nothing to really distinguish it. I got a vague sense that Polanski was trying to make Oliver's plight more empathetic than previous versions of the story, but I don't think he succeeds. Oliver Twist (Barney Clark) is an orphaned boy who can't even find a home in the abysmal conditions of the workhouse. So, at the age of 10, he runs away to London, where he is taken in by an infamous fence, Fagin (Ben Kingsley), and his young gang of pickpockets. When hapless Oliver is wrongly accused of stealing a book, the respectable and well-to-do Mr. Brownlow (Edward Hardwicke) takes pity on him. But wily Fagin isn't inclined to let the boy out of his grasp.""Oliver Twist"" was filmed entirely on sets in Prague, where the streets of 19th century London were recreated on a studio backlot. It looks good in the sense that the city looks ""realistic"" without being too grimy, which is probably suitable for this material. But this adaptation doesn't work as a children's film in spite of that being Polanski's intention. It's too murky. The cinematography is expert, but the frequent use of low-key lighting leaves most of the image in obscurity. The same goes for the accents. I had trouble understanding the cockney. American children who have never heard a cockney accent won't be able to make it out. I don't think that films should be dumbed down for children, but Polanski's dose of ""realism"" in ""Oliver Twist"" requires an audience with a long attention span and unerring concentration. Yes, London's 19th century interiors really were dark and dank. And the accents of its ruffians were, and are, more garbled than those in this film. But ""Oliver Twist"" is a fable that needs to be easily understood. Although it picks up the pace toward the end, this ""Oliver Twist"" is too long, too dull, and too muddy.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2006): ""Twist with Polanski"" (28 min) follows the film from pre-production to casting, filming, and on to post-production through interviews with Roman Polanski, screenwriter Roland Harwood, the cast and producers.

Sheppard, and director of photography Pawel Edelman. In ""Kidding with Oliver Twist"" (5 min), young actor Barney Clark reads several days of his diary entries that he made during filming, which are cut with behind-the-scenes footage. He also talks about the film a year later after seeing the finished product. Subtitles for the film are available in English and French.

Until a few days ago. After 1h 41m the movie got stuck! Took it out of the player, carefully examined the DVD surface... not the slightest scratch or dust particle to be seen. Put it back in, jump to the scene and... stuck again. I have another player... guess what, it gets stuck already at the annoying SONY Pictures opening logo. Tried the disc in two different PCs, same problem: SONY Pictures logo and then... nothing. Ultimately tried to make a copy using DVDFab, a wonderful program that usually helps out, but nope: error reading disc. Of course it is too late now to send it back. I did like the movie though, so I'll spend another 10 bucks for a new copy. Hopefully I can then return here to add some more stars.OK, I re-ordered the DVD and this one is working all the way.

and buy my ticket.well, as it turned out, i wound up at the very last showing-3:15 on a thursday afternoon.the theater was half full at best.we were lucky viewers that afternoon.what an excellent film.after it was over i chatted on my cell phone with my friend about it for 45 minutes.i wanted to take him to go see it too but it left the area that day.i was not pleased that it did not stay in town longer and i wonder why?poor box office i would imagine.about the film: the young lad who played Oliver was excellent as was the entire cast.three images from the film in particular haunted me and i mean that in a good way.the first was a scene with Oliver walking down a country dirt road when around the bend comes a very large, horse-drawn coach filled to the top with passengers. all dressed in black. the coach towered over the young boy as it passed him by.the second image is of the kindly old lady that took Oliver in for a night on his way to London. as she watches him go off the next morning the camera stays close up on her face-a face of love and concern. she reminded me of every loving mother in the world.the third image that made such an impression on me (spoiler alert here).............was shot looking up a darkened flight of stairs just after Nancy's friend had come to see her. she has just opened the door to find her friend dead in a pool of blood (which we do not see) and in shock, all of her groceries and things including a large pale of milk go flying violently out of her arms down the steep steps.i loved the accent Ben Kingsley used for his Fagan. a delight.i loved the kindly elderly book seller that takes Oliver under his wing.there are several scenes of faces looking out of windows, the window panes framing their face. i could not help but associate these with past Polanski faces in windows from his other movies such as The Tenant and Tess.by the way, i recently watched the Dvd edition of Tess and in the added interview with the director he deems The Tenant ""a failure"". unless he means in a purely commercial sense, this statement baffles me!i so badly would love to see Polanski's Oliver Twist again in a dark cinema.but until that day i will buy the DVD when it comes out i'm sure.incidentally, after falling in love with this new Oliver Twist i went out and rented the 1948 version directed by David Lean(which i had never seen) and loved the comparisons made between this older version and the new version.thank you Roman. a wonderful wonderful job!",5,thank you Roman for your Oliver Twist,1130716800,"10 31,

Suffice it to say that the selection of actors, sets, costumes, cinematographer, etc. is satisfying in the extreme.  For those who love Dickens, this is a film that will be pleasing and perhaps surpassing in its understanding of the author, his depth of identification with his protagonist, and his intent - Polanski is a man who understands all too well.  For those who aren't familiar with the book, this film is a revelation.  Social conscience, outrage at the system, and sensitivity to the consequences of turning the lives of other human beings over to some self-congratulatory and deeply flawed social services agency weren't invented by Hollywood actors, Liberals, or Anarchists.

The first half of this version seemed to me almost exactly what you would get if you cut the songs out of ""Oliver!"" which is not criticism, just an observation.  It almost could have been done with the same costumes and sets.  The effect is a film that's a bit gloomier, but more poignant.In the second half there's more to the plot than the musical version, and it's more interesting.

954515,AU1E6KDG1FMG6,B000C20VU0,Rebekah A. Lane,"[0, 0]","This is one of the better versions of Oliver Twist, the classic novel by Charels Dickens. The casting was fairly good, with such characters as Fagin, ""flash"" Toby Cratchit, the Artful Dogder, Charley Bates, and Noah Claypole carrying their parts naturally, and Barney Clark was pure genious as Oliver. Dicken's Oliver is a very complex character, and must be very hard to cast, but Clark plays him effortlessly, and you can't help loving him. The Artful Dogder they chose was also execptional. He looked the part, and brought the right attitude to the role, even when managing what appears to be a delicate balencing act between the corrupted youth of the novel, and the more likable fellow of the Disney film. Sikes and Mr. Bumble were a bit of a disapointment, but I can't help comparing them with the actors who filled those roles in the BBC version. I was also very dissapointed that there was no Monks, no Rose, and no Rose's hopeless would-be-lover. This movie had good directing, good acting, great filming, excellent location and the right music, but somehow it's less than Oliver Twist without him coming to peace with where he came from, the evil and the good -- embodied in the persons of Rose, his cousin, and Monks, his half-brother. Also Rose is needed for the viewer to get the full impact of Nancy's plight. Rose was an unfortunate girl who someone helped, and Nancy was an unfortunate girl who someone used. Dicken's was trying to show how far a little compassion goes, that it can ultimately mean the difference between life and death. With such a great cast, it leaves you wishing they could have gone just a little further and made it perhaps the best adaption of the 21st century. But it's still good, particuarly because of Clark's potrayel of Oliver. He is precious without being adorable, resolute wthout being self-rightous, and forgiving without lowering his ideals. The end was very touching.

This comes closes to some of the story, but still omits some characters and subplots. David Lean's version has the best cinematography, but Nancy is far too sophisticated looking. This Nancy is a bit too milk-maidish healthy to suit me. Shani Wallis came close with her crude good looks. I think Nancy must have been a rather wasted looking girl.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 0]","Whenever I'd go to my grandparents' house, my aunt or my grandmother would watch musicals and I'd sing and dance along.  I loved every single musical number within ""Oliver Twist"" the most, specifically ""I'd Do Anything.""  I think the boy who plays Oliver Twist in this movie is adorable, and it breaks my heart to see him go through all of the issues that happened to him as an orphan.  In the movie (I have not read the book and judging from other reviewers who have, I think I'll pass), an orphan whose mother has died is put into an orphanage but the owners are cruel.  After Oliver makes the mistake of asking for a little bit more food (I can do the ""Please, suh, I want some more"" impression to a tea), he's kicked out of the orphanage in the winter to find shelter.  After a potential owner sees that Oliver won't put up with any comments about his mother, he is shoved into a basement full of coffins.  A loose window is discovered and he escapes to London.  This is when the fun starts!He's found friendship in a pickpocket crew full of thieves and crooks, but he's content there. He sees past their ""career paths"" and embraces the humanity beneath them. They are people who are just trying to get by the same way he is.  (As for the reviewers who say children will have nightmares, I saw this movie when I was in elementary school and never had one nightmare about it.  I did think I was pretty tight on the dance floor after watching it though, no matter how bad I sucked at their moves.  There is murder, domestic violence, theft, and runaways within the film, but every single time something like this happened, there was a lesson to be learned.  To be furious with this movie telling some real life situations that happen when a child runs away or in locations full of runaway children should make you want to donate to organizations that try to help these kids; this isn't just a movie. This stuff is really happening.)Twist ends up going through quite the journey to find a home to call his own, and the film sings his travels through.  I loved this movie as a child, and this weekend, I drove to two stores and online shopping before I found it again in the middle of a thunderstorm.  I didn't care. I wanted this movie!  After rewatching it, although I'm not crazy about the Confederate flags but it's realistic to the times, I still love it just as much.

It looks like a Polanski film for the most part, but the edge has been dulled: like the too spick and span streets in the Prague sets, there's no feeling that this film has been lived in. It's also curious how little impact almost any of the cast make aside from Leanne Rowe's Nancy or Edward Hardwicke's Mr Brownlow, but then with the exception of the chimney sweep none of them are given much of an introduction. Too many, like Ben Kingsley's underwhelming Fagin, are just discovered as part of a scene without any weight or emphasis. Even Bill Sykes is a figure of near disinterest, but then despite having the breeding (his father is a notorious London villain), Jamie Foreman has always lacked menace on screen.

The good things were:1)Ben Kingsley as Fagin.  This was a better-than-I-could-have-imagined-it incarnation of one of Dickens' most intriguing charactars, there can be no arguing that Ben Kingsley is THE Fagin from now on.  He looked it, he acted it, he simply was the charactar.  2)Nancy, who looks exactly as I thought Nancy would.  I don't hold much with Phiz's illustrations of her, I think he makes her too ugly. 3)the undertaker, firstly that they even put him in, secondly that he was well-cast, and thirdly that they put that part about the coffin-shaped snuff-box! It delighted me no end.  4) Mr. Bumble, who was everything that insufferable beadle ought to be.All that said, on the whole, this was not a very interesting movie, which is unfortunate because the story really is very good.  I think the main problem with this movie was the soundtrack by Rachel Portman.  When I first heard the soundtrack to 'Emma', done by the same, I loved it.  When I heard the soundtrack to 'Nicholas Nickleby', also by Portman, I noted that it sounded exactly the same, but it was still okay.  The Oliver Twist soundtrack sounds like more of the same except absolutely no interesting musical ideas whatever.

954526,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000C20VU0,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 6]","Why did Roman Polanski think about making this Dickens classic? His new `Oliver Twist' has the look and feel of the original book, but it seems he forgot to put its heart in it. Some say David Lean version is too old, and some say musical version `Oliver!' is irritating (not me) with dancing Fagin. But they had the spirit of Dickens, inimitable creator of unforgettable characters and gripping storyteller.The film is faithful to the book (perhaps more faithful to David Lean version) though some changes, largely acceptable ones, are made. You know the story of young Oliver (played by Barney Clark) an orphan ill-treated by pompous Mr. Bumble and very mean Noah. Dickensian episodes like Oliver sleeping among the coffins are preserved intact, and there is naturally that scene in which Oliver is forced to proceed and say `Please, sir, I want some more.'The difference is, I think, that Polanski treats these materials too seriously. To me, except for the horrifying part about fate of Sikes, Nancy and Fagin, `Oliver Twist' is a well-made comedy. It could be called a dark comedy, but whatever the definition of comedy is, Bumble and his parochial attitudes are there to be laughed at. Polanski presents these episodes in such a somber color that I thought I was watching a Thomas Hardy adaptation.But there is another set of characters for which `Oliver Twist' is remembered, and you meet them in the London streets (actually recreated for the film with the costly set in a Czech studio).Artful Dodger (Harry Eden) and Nancy (Leanne Rowe) are both good, giving us the convincing and sympathetic portraits of the characters who have to live in the underground world. Jamie Forman's Bill Sikes is just OK, but true menace of the villain is absent from the performance. And top-billed Ben Kingsley as Fagin did not leave a strong impression on me probably because his acting is all make-ups and accents. It is strange, but the more Polanski tries to explore the relations between Oliver and Fagin, the less the character of Fagin gets interesting. Fagin is, to most of us I think, an incorrigible, hopeless, melodramatic baddie you meet only on stage and screen, but Polanski attempts to establish kind of friendship or sympathy between the boy and the fence. His interpretation is not uninteresting, but has no ring of truth.Like the melodious but repetitious riff of Rachel Portman score, this `Oliver Twist' constantly offers beautiful images of the 19th century England from the beginning to the end. But the story is auto-pilot, and the characters are mostly soulless, without Dickens' distinctive touch of horror and humor.",3,"""Please Sir...

But it truly disappointed me and fell short of my expectations from a Polanski film, who ""wowed"" us with Tess and The Pianist.  Scenery lovely, costumes well done, sets very accurate to the early Victorian age, and very gloomy settings with fog, mud, and muck that you can almost smell London, as was.  Sadly, the greatness ended there.  Changes made throughout left the story rather bland and the acting was flat, which I am surprised, as the cast was excellent.  Poor directing can be the only fault, here. The only character who actually had some true spark to her, was Nancy.  Oliver rarely smiled or seemed moved, Fagin seemed too weak and meek, rather than the clever, twisted man he was meant to be. Even Bill Sikes did not have me shivering when he walked on a scene. Only the last scene made you swallow your tears back...the rest of it dragged a bit.  I have seen 5 other versions of this novel to film, and I have to say, this is not a favourite.  They also left out a great deal of characters, like Monks, Rose, her fiance, the Claypoles, and some of the gang. Nothing about the fate of Oliver's mother, nor Oliver living with Rose, nor what happens to Dodger and the rest of the thieving gang.  For a fuller story, see the 6 hour Masterpiece Theatre version; for another dark one, see David Lean's version. For better acting, see the musical. This would be similar to the musical, only darker and no singing and dancing-it isn't supposed to be a party, anyhow!  But too much was left out of this version, which is sad, because it had so much potential.
