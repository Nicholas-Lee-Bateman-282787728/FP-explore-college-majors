349949,AT54Q2ERA4PBR,630299408X,Ben J Korgen,"[2, 2]",I love this movie because it not only reveals practices some football teams have used to win games more often than the native ability of its coaches and players might predict; it also reveals how the same teams work hard to fabricate &#34;squeaky clean&#34; images in spite of using these practices.  The movie accomplishes this while making the overall story exciting.,5,An Outstanding Football Movie About Winning Games At The Expense Of Ethics And Fair Play,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,369,"['love', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'practices', 'football', 'teams', 'have', 'used', 'win', 'games', 'more', 'often', 'native', 'ability', 'coaches', 'players', 'might', 'predict', 'also', 'how', 'same', 'teams', 'work', 'hard', 'fabricate', '34', 'squeaky', 'clean', '34', 'images', 'spite', 'using', 'practices', 'movie', 'making', 'overall', 'story', 'exciting']",Program VHS

349953,AY12DBB0U420B,630299408X,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Since 1954, until my retirement a couple years ago, I've always been part of a university in capacities such as student, graduate student, faculty, visiting faculty or lower-level administration. I've been at The University of Colorado, the University of Washington, Stanford University, the University of Montana and San Diego State University and all have had strong football programs. I particularly enjoyed the UC, UW and SDSU programs, especially the Don Coryell days at SDSU. It seems that a football program has always been a part of my life in one way or another, so I picked up ""The Program"" DVD Starring James Caan in an instant after finding it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart.""The Program"" is an interesting movie and well worth watching. However, the movie is somewhat flawed in several ways and I'd have to say the main fault probably lies with Director Davis Ward. The movie depicts campus life and, specifically that tied in with the football program. My gripe would be that although all of the things depicted go on, and nobody would deny it, the depiction is exaggerated. Everything comes out larger than real life. Trust me on this one. When it comes to campus life, I've been there, done that. The football players come across as ""animals"" rather than some of the fine young men that I've been aware of. The coeds, well, let's just say that every campus has such coeds, but they're not nearly as prominent and abundant as illustrated in the movie. Again, it's a basic truth, but exaggerated. I have nothing against exaggeration when it's used to make a point in a story but this movie has such an across-the-board exaggeration that it actually detracts from the story being told. It's football stuff that you might get from reading newspapers and magazines, not the stuff of real life on an actual campus.Okay, it's a pretty good movie and the only problem it has is that it's tainted by my 58-year university life. If you haven't been on a campus, or you've been on one without a football program, you probably wouldn't even notice. Go ahead and enjoy the movie. It's well done. I can see it as being worth four stars.Gary Peterson",4,Life On A College Campus.

The Program may not be a good movie, but it is a fun one guaranteed to leave you pumped for college football.The Program follows players and coaches at a powerhouse football school (a very thinly disguised FSU) through a mediocre season.  There are a lot of vicious hits, some adequate game day drama, plenty of drinking on a school night, and the quarterback beating a college tennis player in racquetball.  Everybody (I mean EVERYBODY) is a stereotype, but they're generally well done.  Unsurprisingly, a young Omar Epps and a young Halle Berry outshine their still largely unknown co-stars.  Surprisingly, James Caan delivers a weak and wooden performance.

James Caan plays a football coach for the ESU Timberwolves(or wolves) a potential bowl competing team being quarterbacked by superstar 'Joe Kane' played by Craig Sheffer(somebody who I have never seen in another movie).  The team is not without their troubles as the movie follows several different players and gives us insight into their personal issues while on the team.The movie starts off with a scene showing us the Timberwolves losing a game that knocks them out of the playoffs for the year.  Determined, coach Winters(Caan) works towards building the team for next year, recruiting players and assessing the best strategy and position for each player.  As training camp begins, the players return and one in particular, Lattimer, appears to have taken steroids in the off season.There's other scenes in the first part of the movie, including Darnell Jefferson(Omar Epps) and his introduction to the school.  He is the teams savior, only problem is he fumbles and he is behind in his grades.  The quarterback, Joe Kane, who has an alcoholic parent and who himself drinks to ""blow off steam"" after a game.  Then there's Alvin Mack(Duane Davis) a standout defensive lineman who hopes to one day play in the NFL and essentially puts all his hopes into playing career, skipping classes and cutting out the whole 'educational' part to his college experience.As the movie progresses, these characters and a few others develop over the team's season and we see how their problems are escalated or handled.  At times, there's enough issues in this movie to make you think that there's no dependable character in the movie other than Kristy Swanson's character who plays Joe Kane's caring girlfriend.  Some of the issues seemed liked they're a little glossed over, but the characters are all college kids so as the audience we can understand/relate to the pressures they're going through.In some ways this movie is similar to Higher Learning(1995), but without the depth or issues of that movie.

Sonny Corleone vacillated between a ginzo accent and a southern accent for parts of the movie. Pretty impressive. Playing for coach Cann was Alvin Mack the stud LB who liked to say crazy crazy to the offense before the snap. Alvin was the heart breaker in this one. He was a sure-fire NFL prospect who talked smack to the wrong Iowa guard and got his leg snapped. On the bright side Cann goes to visit him in the hospital and the two give us a lesson in B emotion. There were a couple other problems like Lattimer the juicehead gorilla DE back when DE were bulkyheaded white guys instead of freaks of nature like Cameron Wake. Yeaaaah buddy! He gave us one of the best scenes though when he finds out he's starting opening day and immediately jeopardized it by head butting 4 car windows. The real star of the show of course was #13 QB Joe Kane the western PA trash with the golden arm a drinking problem and an affinity for cheating death on his hog. He was Dylan McKay as a heisman candidate. If that's not B...Fantastic movie and due to Cann's mailing in coupled with Omar Epps playing the gangster RB with the heart of gold who is apparently the team's only receiver and Joe Kane's dad this was a superior effort. Joe's dad even said ""Merry f'in Christmas"" to show you he was really guttersnipe tripe. We actually had to take a star away here for the fact that this would have been very disappointing years ago. 27 year old Hallie Berry was in this movie playing J Reed's love interest and they didn't have her in even a bikini once.

Unfortunately, there aren't too many out there. While I did find The Program somewhat entertaining, I thought that it tried to appeal to way too many *types* of viewers by convoluting any one clear and relevant plotline with a host of subplots.At the beginning of this movie, you may be led to believe that the movie is going to be a sort of expose on the business that college athletics has become. We start out by seeing the college's well-planned attempt at trying to recruit a blue chip running-back (Omar Epps). James Cann is great as the 3-dimensional cool-headed coach, who understands that college football is big money (I like contrasting this to the mean sum'va'bitch coach that Jon Voight plays in Varsity Blues). This underscores the idea that education is a secondary concern to many university officials.There are some great moments in the movie about NCAA corruption. Star linebackers take alumni bribes in the movie. Issues of steroid addiction and grade fixing are touched upon, but never examined to full capacity. Don't get me wrong, normally, I like my sports movies with plenty of sports, but I don't think that the proper set up was there for this to be called a solid 100% sports flick.While the movie toys with the idea of being a sort of expose, it never quite gets off the ground. I think this is largely due to the fact that the makers of the film tried to rig it to appeal to too many different audiences.For example, for the non-sports fans, there are 2 romantic subplots. One involving the moping pariah star QB, Joe Cain, and his passion for the girl who doesn't date jocks (touching...yawn). And yet, another involving Epp's and Halle's characters. For the sports diehards, there is the oh so very cliche big game with the classic slow motion play that always works. For the sentimental crowd there is another subplot involving Joe Kain's tobacco-roadish alcoholic father who never goes to see him play. There is, yet another subplot about Kain's rehab from eposodic alcoholism.Like I said, normally I like my sports movies with plenty sports, but this movie frames itself up to deal with the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; issues and just doesn't come through. Yes, NCAA football is a dirty business. Shoot to kill! Who gives a damn whether Omar Epps and Joe Kane find true romance?By the way, the guy who played Lattimer deserved an Oscar for best supporting actor!",3,"Too Many Subplots, but still a Good Effort",1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,2546,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'overall', 'feel', 'curtain', 'NCAA', 'college', 'football', 'about', 'ai', ""n't"", 'one', 'Unfortunately', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'there', 'did', 'find', 'Program', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'tried', 'appeal', 'way', 'too', 'many', '*types*', 'viewers', 'convoluting', 'one', 'clear', 'relevant', 'plotline', 'host', 'subplots.At', 'beginning', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'led', 'believe', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'sort', 'expose', 'business', 'college', 'athletics', 'become', 'start', 'out', 'seeing', 'college', 'well-planned', 'attempt', 'trying', 'recruit', 'blue', 'chip', 'running-back', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'James', 'Cann', 'great', '3-dimensional', 'cool-headed', 'coach', 'who', 'college', 'football', 'big', 'money', 'like', 'contrasting', 'mean', ""sum'va'bitch"", 'coach', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'idea', 'education', 'secondary', 'concern', 'many', 'university', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'movie', 'NCAA', 'corruption', 'Star', 'linebackers', 'take', 'alumni', 'bribes', 'movie', 'Issues', 'steroid', 'addiction', 'grade', 'fixing', 'are', 'touched', 'never', 'examined', 'full', 'capacity', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'normally', 'like', 'sports', 'movies', 'plenty', 'sports', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'proper', 'set', 'up', 'was', 'there', 'be', 'called', 'solid', '100', '%', 'sports', 'movie', 'idea', 'being', 'sort', 'expose', 'never', 'quite', 'ground', 'think', 'largely', 'due', 'fact', 'makers', 'film', 'tried', 'rig', 'appeal', 'too', 'many', 'different', 'audiences.For', 'example', 'non-sports', 'fans', 'are', '2', 'romantic', 'subplots', 'One', 'involving', 'moping', 'pariah', 'star', 'QB', 'Joe', 'Cain', 'passion', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'date', 'jocks', 'touching', 'yawn', 'yet', 'involving', 'Epp', 'Halle', 'characters', 'sports', 'diehards', 'oh', 'so', 'very', 'cliche', 'big', 'game', 'classic', 'slow', 'motion', 'play', 'always', 'sentimental', 'crowd', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Joe', 'Kain', 'tobacco-roadish', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'who', 'never', 'see', 'play', 'yet', 'subplot', 'Kain', 'rehab', 'eposodic', 'alcoholism.Like', 'said', 'normally', 'like', 'sports', 'movies', 'plenty', 'sports', 'movie', 'up', 'deal', 'quot', 'scenes', 'quot', 'issues', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'Yes', 'NCAA', 'football', 'dirty', 'business', 'Shoot', 'kill', 'Who', 'damn', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'Joe', 'Kane', 'find', 'true', 'romance', 'way', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Lattimer', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor']",Program VHS
349966,A1FT7QFKNHL9DT,630299408X,Wolfe Moffat,"[2, 3]","Yeah, a football movie. But one to be admired? Nope. Is there lots of hard hitting action? Yep. But are there better? Uh-huh. This movie just tries too hard. And James Caan has had better performances, for example, ""Brian's Song"". As for Craig Sheffer, this isn't his best either. You could probably give the hot spot to Omar Epps just for his hard work to try to make mediocrity into something worth watching.We have football movies with better quality than this. While I can watch this a few times, and laugh at some of the dumb humor, it just doesn't stand up. ""The Program"" has been since buried by good stuff, such as ""Remember The Titans"" and most recently ""Friday Night Lights"". It tried to match the standard of classics like ""Brian's Song"" and ""Rudy"". Most of the humor stacks up there with the likes of ""Little Giants"".I think this also finds itself looking for originality. This stumbles under pressure, and tries way, way too hard! With quotes such as ""PLACE AT THE TABLE!"", you may be seated, but don't ask me for seconds after the indigestion. Keep looking for dinner.
