Chapdelaine ""film collector""","[4, 22]","i just finished the series about a half an hour ago and let me tell you it's almost not worth the time. i didn't really understand the first episode until the very end but even then there are so many gaps that you have to draw your own conclusion. the only reason i'm giving this series 3 out of 5 is because the other 24 episodes (out of 25) are awesome. they are filled with mystery, sword play, demons, love, and the meaning of true friendship. all the ideal key points of an excellent fantasy series. to bad the series had to end. not recommended unless you like horrible anime endings. i'd say this was the worst i've ever seen. second and third would have to be neon genesis evangelion and gantz. these terrible closers aren't even as bad as berserk though. if you'd like to read 4 million manga comics i guess you might want to consider investing time and money into this crap but i like an animated series to close itself. i don't want to have to read to comprehend a MOVIE. that's why it's called anime (animation) not readime. i'm very glad i watched the entire series on youtube before i rushed out and bought it (which i almost did). i would highly recommend that you do the same. that's youtube.com.",3,very disappointed !!!,1144195200,"04 5, 2006",2006,1212,"['i', 'just', 'finished', 'series', 'half', 'hour', 'ago', 'let', 'tell', 'almost', 'not', 'time', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'first', 'episode', 'very', 'end', 'even', 'then', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'gaps', 'have', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusion', 'only', 'reason', 'i', ""'m"", 'giving', 'series', '3', '5', 'other', '24', 'episodes', '25', 'are', 'awesome', 'are', 'filled', 'mystery', 'sword', 'play', 'demons', 'love', 'meaning', 'true', 'friendship', 'ideal', 'key', 'points', 'excellent', 'fantasy', 'series', 'bad', 'series', 'had', 'end', 'not', 'recommended', 'like', 'horrible', 'anime', 'endings', 'i', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'worst', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'second', 'third', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'neon', 'genesis', 'evangelion', 'gantz', 'terrible', 'closers', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'as', 'bad', 'berserk', ""'d"", 'like', 'read', '4', 'million', 'manga', 'comics', 'i', 'guess', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'investing', 'time', 'money', 'crap', 'i', 'animated', 'series', 'close', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'read', 'comprehend', 'MOVIE', 'why', 'called', 'anime', 'animation', 'not', 'readime', 'i', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'i', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'youtube', 'i', 'rushed', 'out', 'bought', 'almost', 'did', 'i', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'do', 'same', 'youtube.com']",Berserk: Season 1
774829,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B0000CABH8,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[11, 12]","Berserk, as a series, is one of those anime that starts out--at least after the first episode--slowly, and in many moments, boringly. It's essentially a character introduction in a series. We are dragged along by the will of the creators as they show us this massive, angry man named Guts. During the series, we learn of his willpower, his skill with the sword, and of his penchant for murder. Also, we meet two people intricately tied to him, Caska and Griffith, one a future lover, the other a future enemy. Odd thing is, it isn't that clear between the two which is which until about halfway through.Berserk is a dark fantasy, literally. It takes place in a fantasy setting, often drenched in blood and dread, and men are constantly hewing other men in half with swords, spears, axes, or halberds. There are few morals beyond loyalty and brotherhood in battle, a moral found in every anime, TV show, or movie that deals with war. But the themes are there, and all of the them are dark, dealing mostly with murder, vengeance, and greed (or just about every one of the Seven Deadly Sins). But what's clear is that Berserk never tries to be anything else. It doesn't mislead you with slapstick, or with constant, giggly characters. The atmosphere is thick, and it never lets up. If you don't like the first episode, then you won't like the series. It immediately tries to scare away the faint of heart early on.Though at times the animation quality could be better, the style here is a little different in that they follow few of the regular anime guidelines. Some of the characters have big eyes, but beyond that they are proportioned perfectly, giving the animation a sense of reality, which of course only adds to the intensity of the story. The animation gets a little better during moments of single combat, usually when Guts is swinging his sword, making the action scenes worth watching. Though rarely, they do recycle animation (moments that's found earlier on in an episode, like firing a volley of arrows, repeated in a later scene or after a commercial break), which can be off-putting at times. Most of this, though, is done in the earlier episodes, so it's easy to forget about.Beyond that, other bonuses include a decent fantasy soundtrack that matches well to the mood of the scenes in the anime. Most of the characters are unique in some way to anime. And, though this can't really be considered a bonus for some, it has plenty of violence, enough to spread across two or even three different anime. So, if you like this in your anime, then here it is.It's hard to recommend this anime because Berserk doesn't compare to many other fantasy anime, besides Record of Lodoss War. It does compare to other anime outside Berserk's genre, however, so if you enjoyed 3 x 3 Eyes, Doomed Megalopolis, or are now enjoying Gantz or Elfen Lied, then pick this up. Berserk is a great series, not one of the best, but still close. It has a solid story, with interesting characters that drive the action and the plot.",5,"Death, Demons, and Guts Galore",1136937600,"01 11, 2006",2006,3018,"['Berserk', 'series', 'one', 'anime', 'out', 'least', 'first', 'episode', 'slowly', 'many', 'moments', 'boringly', 'essentially', 'character', 'introduction', 'series', 'are', 'dragged', 'will', 'creators', 'show', 'massive', 'angry', 'man', 'named', 'Guts', 'series', 'learn', 'willpower', 'skill', 'sword', 'penchant', 'murder', 'Also', 'meet', 'two', 'people', 'intricately', 'tied', 'Caska', 'Griffith', 'one', 'future', 'lover', 'other', 'future', 'enemy', 'Odd', 'thing', ""n't"", 'clear', 'two', 'halfway', 'through.Berserk', 'dark', 'fantasy', 'literally', 'place', 'fantasy', 'setting', 'often', 'drenched', 'blood', 'dread', 'men', 'are', 'constantly', 'hewing', 'other', 'men', 'half', 'swords', 'spears', 'axes', 'halberds', 'are', 'few', 'morals', 'loyalty', 'brotherhood', 'battle', 'moral', 'found', 'anime', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', 'deals', 'war', 'themes', 'are', 'there', 'are', 'dark', 'dealing', 'mostly', 'murder', 'vengeance', 'greed', 'just', 'one', 'Seven', 'Deadly', 'Sins', 'what', 'clear', 'Berserk', 'never', 'be', 'anything', 'else', ""n't"", 'mislead', 'slapstick', 'constant', 'giggly', 'characters', 'atmosphere', 'thick', 'never', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'first', 'episode', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'series', 'immediately', 'scare', 'away', 'faint', 'heart', 'early', 'on.Though', 'times', 'animation', 'quality', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'style', 'here', 'little', 'different', 'follow', 'few', 'regular', 'anime', 'guidelines', 'characters', 'have', 'big', 'eyes', 'are', 'proportioned', 'perfectly', 'giving', 'animation', 'sense', 'reality', 'course', 'only', 'intensity', 'story', 'animation', 'little', 'better', 'moments', 'single', 'combat', 'usually', 'when', 'Guts', 'swinging', 'sword', 'making', 'action', 'scenes', 'watching', 'Though', 'rarely', 'do', 'recycle', 'animation', 'moments', 'found', 'earlier', 'episode', 'firing', 'volley', 'arrows', 'repeated', 'later', 'scene', 'commercial', 'break', 'can', 'be', 'off-putting', 'times', 'Most', 'though', 'done', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'easy', 'forget', 'about.Beyond', 'other', 'bonuses', 'include', 'decent', 'fantasy', 'soundtrack', 'well', 'mood', 'scenes', 'anime', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'unique', 'way', 'anime', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'considered', 'bonus', 'plenty', 'violence', 'enough', 'spread', 'two', 'even', 'three', 'different', 'anime', 'So', 'like', 'anime', 'then', 'here', 'is.It', 'hard', 'recommend', 'anime', 'Berserk', ""n't"", 'compare', 'many', 'other', 'fantasy', 'anime', 'Record', 'Lodoss', 'War', 'compare', 'other', 'anime', 'Berserk', 'genre', 'however', 'enjoyed', '3', '3', 'Eyes', 'Doomed', 'Megalopolis', 'are', 'now', 'enjoying', 'Gantz', 'Elfen', 'Lied', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'Berserk', 'great', 'series', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'still', 'close', 'solid', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'drive', 'action', 'plot']",Berserk: Season 1

There are quiet a number of suss moments, especially between Guts and Griffith and how Guts just wants to be near Griffith and protect him. Also the fact that Griffith slept with another man for money and the water fight Guts and Griffith had - where I'll say that Guts was clothed but Griffith was only in his birthday suit. Some lovely slash moments are featured in this series. Some of which are carried further with the outtakes.Though there are quiet a number of disturbing bits for Yaoi Fans from Disc 5 onwards, I just skip them. They always include Coska. Truthfully if this series was true to history she wouldn't be in the army - which would have made the series a lot better. She annoys me with the average `plight' she's in. If it was more believable maybe I woulda cared?The best part (yes even better then the Anime) was the outtakes.

774833,A3PAMMMH9F56K9,B0000CABH8,Giacomo C.,"[1, 1]","Berserk really is a cut above most anime series.  All its elements come together to form a very satisfying whole aimed at an older audience.The one big disappointment that most fans come to face is the fact that the story is imcomplete - a 2nd season that has yet to surface is needed to complete what was begun in the 1st.  This situation has arisen due to the fact that the comic book upon which it is based was still running at the end of the series, and thus there was no ending to animate.  Hopefully those with the means will give the public what it wants, and produce a 2nd season to complete the excellent work that was begun in the 1st.These issues should not deter you from viewing what actually has been done though - it is too good to pass up, if you are a fan of the somewhat unusual in animation.  Another bonus is that this series has no 'filler' episodes whatsoever, each and every one is essential to the development of the story.

One more thing: the music is great, both in the episodes as well as during the beginning and ending.

The show has characters you'll love, enemies you'll hate, love and compassion.  This had everything I loved about the series. It is a very dark and some what scary series.  It's very very disturbing also.  The best thing about this series are the characters that you'll fall in love with and of course......Gutts..Spoiler ALERT..sort of*Poor Gutts.  This guy has one of the most screwed up life ever.  You'll feel for this guy.  I mean what ever the poor guy does he always ends up paying for it.  He was given birth by his deceased mother(that is correct...deceased)and to make things worse, the man who took care of him tries to murder him and sadly Gutts was at the wrong moment at the wrong time.  Then to add some more to the ingriedeant he finally finds friends he can be with and finally share compassion with and see's them as his home and family(the hawks)but sadly they all get torn apart and eatin by demons.  Oh were not done yet, the woman he loves and has a child with(Caska)ends up getting raped and tortured by a demonic creature who was once human and his friend(Griffith).  But that's not over for Gutts yet...He slices off his own arm so he can prevent the rape of the woman he loves with no success of course and ends up losing his right eye to a demon.  Poor poor gutts.  SPOILER DONE..Berserk is a very chilling series.  It's dark and not for many people who are looking for something fun and happy like Pokemon.  Berserk also has one of the most saddest, darkets and down right depressing endings ever.  I will assure you that on the last 10 seconds of the last episode as Gutts is walking down to his next destination to get vengance on those who put him through hell(literaly)you will get chills.  I will never forget that ending when he was walking down the desert with a close up on his face and you see nothing except his left and right eye(which is blinded cause of a demon).  Very chilling ending.Berserk is also a very violent series.  It holds nothing back and has some really unsettling scenes(some involving his final moments with the Hawk on the last episode).  So if you have young one I don't recommend seeing this series as It is recommended to people ages 17 or up.  The series has a really great storyline, lots of twist and turns until the final episode.  Overall this series is awesome and I recommend it.The reason I didn't give it a 5 is because of the way it ends.  But I will assure you that if you know a store that sells the manga go out and read them!  I have read all the way up to Vol 16 and the series is not getting pretty at all(not after what Gutts go's through on vol 13).  Overall Berserk is everything I want in a series and is not for the faint and weak ones.  In the end I give this amazing series a...4.9 out of 5 stars.Again this is recommended to a mature audience.  You could maybe compare this with Spawn(hey c'mon Al Simmons go's through just as much pain as Gutts)Lates",4,My favorite anime series...,1104278400,"12 29, 2004",2004,3007,"['Berserk', 'doublt', 'best', 'anime', 'ever', 'next', 'Neon', 'Genisis', 'show', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'love', 'enemies', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'love', 'compassion', 'had', 'everything', 'loved', 'series', 'very', 'dark', 'what', 'scary', 'series', 'very', 'very', 'disturbing', 'also', 'best', 'thing', 'series', 'are', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'love', 'course', 'Gutts..Spoiler', 'ALERT..sort', 'of*Poor', 'Gutts', 'guy', 'one', 'most', 'screwed', 'up', 'life', 'ever', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'guy', 'mean', 'what', 'ever', 'poor', 'guy', 'always', 'up', 'paying', 'was', 'given', 'birth', 'deceased', 'mother', 'correct', 'deceased', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'man', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'tries', 'murder', 'sadly', 'Gutts', 'was', 'wrong', 'moment', 'wrong', 'time', 'Then', 'add', 'more', 'ingriedeant', 'finally', 'friends', 'can', 'be', 'finally', 'share', 'compassion', 'see', 'home', 'family', 'hawks', 'sadly', 'get', 'torn', 'apart', 'eatin', 'demons', 'Oh', 'were', 'not', 'done', 'yet', 'woman', 'child', 'Caska', 'up', 'getting', 'raped', 'tortured', 'demonic', 'creature', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'human', 'friend', 'Griffith', 'not', 'Gutts', 'yet', 'off', 'own', 'arm', 'can', 'prevent', 'rape', 'woman', 'success', 'course', 'up', 'losing', 'right', 'eye', 'demon', 'Poor', 'poor', 'gutts', 'SPOILER', 'DONE..Berserk', 'very', 'chilling', 'series', 'dark', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'fun', 'happy', 'Pokemon', 'Berserk', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'saddest', 'darkets', 'down', 'right', 'depressing', 'endings', 'ever', 'will', 'assure', 'last', '10', 'seconds', 'last', 'episode', 'Gutts', 'walking', 'down', 'next', 'destination', 'get', 'vengance', 'who', 'put', 'hell', 'literaly', 'will', 'get', 'chills', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'ending', 'when', 'was', 'walking', 'down', 'desert', 'close', 'up', 'face', 'see', 'nothing', 'left', 'right', 'eye', 'blinded', 'cause', 'demon', 'Very', 'chilling', 'ending.Berserk', 'also', 'very', 'violent', 'series', 'nothing', 'back', 'really', 'unsettling', 'scenes', 'involving', 'final', 'moments', 'Hawk', 'last', 'episode', 'So', 'have', 'young', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'seeing', 'series', 'recommended', 'people', 'ages', '17', 'up', 'series', 'really', 'great', 'storyline', 'lots', 'twist', 'final', 'episode', 'Overall', 'series', 'awesome', 'recommend', 'it.The', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'way', 'will', 'assure', 'know', 'store', 'manga', 'go', 'out', 'read', 'have', 'read', 'way', 'Vol', '16', 'series', 'not', 'getting', 'pretty', 'not', 'what', 'Gutts', 'go', 'vol', '13', 'Overall', 'Berserk', 'everything', 'want', 'series', 'not', 'faint', 'weak', 'ones', 'end', 'give', 'amazing', 'series', '4.9', '5', 'stars.Again', 'recommended', 'mature', 'audience', 'could', 'maybe', 'compare', 'Spawn', 'hey', ""c'mon"", 'Al', 'Simmons', 'go', 'through', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'pain', 'Gutts']",Berserk: Season 1

The first thing you will notice is that this series has so much camera pans in it that it sometimes feels like you are watching a still picture slideshow with voiceovers. The next annoying thing is the animation, which is pretty recycled and bad. With that said I will say that the storyline is addictive until about the last two or three episodes at the end of the series, when it basically turns from believable to fantasy/ ridiculous. Out of nowhere it seems like the story turns from something interesting and passionate to ..well, garbage. I have read some of the manga so I expected the series to be about this character named Guts fighting demons but it ended up being a 24 episode flash back. The mood was set through the whole series to be about war and friendship, love and growing up and then suddenly they switch from this mood (which was going very very well) to the mood of the manga which is different and it ends up spoiling all that was built up. Despite it being a flashback the history of the character is very interesting and it will keep you interested but if you were expecting a demon slaying action series there are only about 3 episodes of that, mostly it is human war. The good thing about the boxed set is the actual box which is done very good with great artwork and will make you want to keep it. I would suggest that instead of buying the whole thing, rent all of the episodes one time and watch them. It is interesting to see the story of these characters evolve but after watching it through once there is no real reason to want to see long pans, bad animation and the extremely poorly done conclusion over again.",3,Good but ..,1097452800,"10 11, 2004",2004,1755,"['was', 'pretty', 'good', 'anime', 'are', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'actually', 'want', 'buy', 'first', 'thing', 'will', 'notice', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'camera', 'sometimes', 'are', 'watching', 'still', 'picture', 'slideshow', 'voiceovers', 'next', 'annoying', 'thing', 'animation', 'pretty', 'recycled', 'bad', 'said', 'will', 'say', 'storyline', 'addictive', 'last', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'end', 'series', 'when', 'basically', 'believable', 'fantasy/', 'ridiculous', 'nowhere', 'story', 'something', 'interesting', 'passionate', '..well', 'garbage', 'have', 'read', 'manga', 'so', 'expected', 'series', 'be', 'character', 'named', 'Guts', 'fighting', 'demons', 'ended', 'up', 'being', '24', 'episode', 'flash', 'back', 'mood', 'was', 'set', 'whole', 'series', 'be', 'war', 'friendship', 'love', 'growing', 'up', 'then', 'suddenly', 'switch', 'mood', 'was', 'going', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'mood', 'manga', 'different', 'up', 'spoiling', 'was', 'built', 'up', 'being', 'flashback', 'history', 'character', 'very', 'interesting', 'will', 'keep', 'interested', 'were', 'expecting', 'demon', 'slaying', 'action', 'series', 'are', 'only', '3', 'episodes', 'mostly', 'human', 'war', 'good', 'thing', 'boxed', 'set', 'actual', 'box', 'done', 'very', 'good', 'great', 'artwork', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'keep', 'would', 'suggest', 'instead', 'buying', 'whole', 'thing', 'rent', 'episodes', 'one', 'time', 'watch', 'interesting', 'see', 'story', 'characters', 'evolve', 'watching', 'once', 'real', 'reason', 'want', 'see', 'long', 'pans', 'bad', 'animation', 'extremely', 'poorly', 'done', 'conclusion', 'again']",Berserk: Season 1

774849,A3A1NTONWQ1SP7,B0000CABH8,Sylvantha,"[2, 2]","Okay, I have been reading some fairly negative reviews about this series and thought I would provide some clarification on apparently the biggest complaint - the ending.  First of all, you have to understand that Berserk is a bi-weekly comic book published in Japanese and these DVD's are simply an animated version of the books that was playing late night in Japan.  The animation, if memory serves me correct, covers books 1 through 13 of the comics and ends there.  However, the comic books series continue much more (and even on-going as I write this today) and currently the comics are at 26!  So all I am trying to say is these DVD's should not be criticized for their ending because that is not how the story ends... the animation only ends and in the comics, Guts is adventures are continuing strongly.But for many of you, who do not live in Japan or do not have access to the Japanese comics... here is a summary of what happens next (WARNING!  SPOILERS AHEAD!)1.  After being rescued from &quot;hell&quot; by the skull helmed warrior, Guts and Casca are returned to the mountain where he trained after immediately leaving the Falcon Army.2.  Caska has gone insane from her experiences and gives birth to a half demon child (who immediately disappears to reappear numerous times later).3.  Leaving Casca, Guts sets out to hunt down the various disciples of God Hand and kills quite a few.4.  Upon returning back home, he realizes that Casca has disappeared (wandered off) and he sets out on a quest to find her.5.  During the quest, after defeating some disciples, he rescues Casca.  However, in the craziness surrounding the rescue, Gryphis returns to the normal mortal plane.6.  Having a mortal body, Gryphic reforms the Falcon Army which is then used to defeat Midland from the invading armies of Kushan.7.  Meanwhile, Guts, accompanied with Casco, a young witch, a thief, and a former inquistor and her body guard travel to find Gryphis.8.  Guts get superpowered up by gaining a Dwarven Armor that makes him unbelievably strong (and it is hinted that this is the same type of armor worn by the skull helmed warrior).That is about where the comic ended today.  Anyways, I hope that this was of some help to some people but.. let me just say this, for those who loved the animation.. the comics are infinitely better.

The tales of Guts and his quest to destroy the Godhand were never told as this series was all buildup to that.The series is basically the first set part of the story on how Guts eventually came to hate the Godshand and their hords of Demons.  The battles are violent and the story is actually very good (with good voice acting as well).  It plays off as more of a Fantasy epic that ends with a Holy S--- ending that leaves you craving more.  The story is very well told but sadly like so many other Anime series the full tales are never told as the series did not last past season 1.  Thus there is a major feeling of incompletness that can now only be fullfilled with the Mangas.  However what is here is an incredible series that combines wonderful story telling with gut wrenching violence.  Highly recomended.,5,Awsome Series that should of lived longer,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,870,"['Berserk', 'so', 'many', 'Anime', 'Series', 'incomplete', 'one', 'tales', 'Guts', 'quest', 'destroy', 'Godhand', 'were', 'never', 'told', 'series', 'was', 'buildup', 'that.The', 'series', 'basically', 'first', 'set', 'part', 'story', 'how', 'Guts', 'eventually', 'came', 'hate', 'Godshand', 'hords', 'Demons', 'battles', 'are', 'violent', 'story', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'good', 'voice', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'off', 'more', 'Fantasy', 'epic', 'Holy', 'S', 'ending', 'craving', 'more', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'told', 'sadly', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Anime', 'series', 'full', 'tales', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'last', 'season', '1', 'Thus', 'major', 'feeling', 'incompletness', 'can', 'now', 'only', 'be', 'fullfilled', 'Mangas', 'However', 'what', 'here', 'incredible', 'series', 'wonderful', 'story', 'telling', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'violence', 'Highly', 'recomended']",Berserk: Season 1
