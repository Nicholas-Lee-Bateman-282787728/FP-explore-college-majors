236230,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300270203,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","There is a subtle yet all-consuming darkness that permeates `Rachel, Rachel', giving the audience a marvelous sense of pure, organic realism.  In fact, there are few films that say so much without really thrusting in your face (as is the Hollywood trend).  I should have known this film would be this way.  Paul Newman (greatest actor to ever walk the face of the earth) became so great because of his brilliant use of subtlety within his own acting.  He brings so much of what made him great into his directorial debut, a small yet poignant film about a brittle woman learning to understand her own strengths.`Rachel, Rachel' tells the story of Rachel, a middle-aged woman who is trapped within her own existence.  Ever since she was a child she has been slightly out of place within her own skin, and as the years press on she continues to become even more lost.  Living with her mother (and basically becoming her caretaker after the passing of her father), Rachel does very little for herself, not only out of necessity but also out of a sick sense of convenience.  She uses her circumstances as a way to limit her interactions with others, thus lightening her emotional load.  She has become conditioned, through the faults of those around her but also through her own faults, and so she becomes a fragile shell of a woman.But spontaneity and aimlessness collide sometimes, and the results are usually far more than we bargained for.I don't want to get too much into the actual plot progression here, because seeing it for yourself and watching the seemingly simple escapades unfold is all part of the beauty of this film.  I will say that `Rachel, Rachel' uses what may appear to be a normal progression of events in order to establish the emotional state with which Rachel finds herself.  She is forced to make some very mature decisions and this forces her to come to terms with who she really is, or at least begin to do so.The film is littered with flashback sequences and internal conversations that shed a small light on the woman growing inside Rachel.  What I love so much about the way Newman handled with storytelling aspect of the film is that he never gives away too much.  In fact, even after all is said and done you still have that aching wonderment in the back of your mind that only elevates Rachel's story.  You still don't quite `know' her, and maybe that is because Rachel still doesn't quite `know' herself; but you are both starting to put the pieces together.With astonishing performances by the entire cast (especially Oscar nominees Joanne Woodward and a remarkable Estelle Parsons), `Rachel, Rachel' really gets under the skin and settles there.I wanted to take a brief second to commend the screenwriters for creating a `mother' character that was not a ridiculous clich&eacute;.  There are so many films that create monsters within their demanding parental figures, and Rachel's mother easily could have diverted to that category, but she doesn't.  She remains surprisingly human, which only helps to confirm that Rachel herself is her own worst enemy and the only person who is truly holding her back.  This film really understands the importance of fleshing out the woman that is Rachel and allowing the audience to study her.Easily one of the more poignant and underrated films of the 60's.",5,"Remarkable, Remarkable",1283385600,"09 2, 2010",2010,3327,"['subtle', 'yet', 'all-consuming', 'darkness', 'Rachel', 'Rachel', 'giving', 'audience', 'marvelous', 'sense', 'pure', 'organic', 'realism', 'fact', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'thrusting', 'face', 'Hollywood', 'trend', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'greatest', 'actor', 'ever', 'walk', 'face', 'earth', 'became', 'so', 'great', 'brilliant', 'use', 'subtlety', 'own', 'acting', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'made', 'great', 'directorial', 'debut', 'small', 'yet', 'poignant', 'film', 'brittle', 'woman', 'learning', 'understand', 'own', 'strengths.', 'Rachel', 'Rachel', 'story', 'Rachel', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'who', 'trapped', 'own', 'existence', 'Ever', 'was', 'child', 'been', 'slightly', 'place', 'own', 'skin', 'years', 'press', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'lost', 'Living', 'mother', 'basically', 'becoming', 'caretaker', 'passing', 'father', 'Rachel', 'very', 'little', 'not', 'only', 'necessity', 'also', 'sick', 'sense', 'convenience', 'circumstances', 'way', 'limit', 'interactions', 'others', 'thus', 'lightening', 'emotional', 'load', 'become', 'conditioned', 'faults', 'also', 'own', 'faults', 'so', 'fragile', 'shell', 'woman.But', 'spontaneity', 'aimlessness', 'collide', 'sometimes', 'results', 'are', 'usually', 'far', 'more', 'bargained', 'for.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'actual', 'plot', 'progression', 'here', 'seeing', 'watching', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'escapades', 'unfold', 'part', 'beauty', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'Rachel', 'Rachel', 'uses', 'what', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'normal', 'progression', 'events', 'order', 'establish', 'emotional', 'state', 'Rachel', 'forced', 'make', 'very', 'mature', 'decisions', 'come', 'terms', 'who', 'really', 'least', 'begin', 'do', 'so.The', 'film', 'littered', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'internal', 'conversations', 'shed', 'small', 'light', 'woman', 'growing', 'Rachel', 'What', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'way', 'Newman', 'handled', 'storytelling', 'aspect', 'film', 'never', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'fact', 'even', 'said', 'done', 'still', 'have', 'aching', 'wonderment', 'back', 'mind', 'only', 'Rachel', 'story', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'maybe', 'Rachel', 'still', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'are', 'starting', 'put', 'pieces', 'together.With', 'astonishing', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'especially', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'remarkable', 'Estelle', 'Parsons', 'Rachel', 'Rachel', 'really', 'skin', 'settles', 'there.I', 'wanted', 'take', 'brief', 'second', 'commend', 'screenwriters', 'creating', 'mother', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'ridiculous', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'create', 'monsters', 'demanding', 'parental', 'figures', 'Rachel', 'mother', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'diverted', 'category', ""n't"", 'surprisingly', 'human', 'only', 'confirm', 'Rachel', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'truly', 'holding', 'back', 'film', 'really', 'importance', 'fleshing', 'out', 'woman', 'Rachel', 'allowing', 'audience', 'study', 'her.Easily', 'one', 'more', 'poignant', 'underrated', 'films', '60']",N/A

Everything is done so carefully and meticulously that there is hardly any room for anyone to breathe. But at the same time there are some things that work very well - especially the flashbacks, some only a few seconds in lengh.Joanne Woodward plays a sexually suppressed and totally sheltered middle-aged school teacher. She lives with her mother and her life is so insulated she doesn't know how to even talk to anyone outside her limited circle. One day a schoolmate returns to town (played wonderfully by James Olsen) and seduces her. She immediately falls for him, and so ardently that she frightens him away. Then she thinks she's pregnant, which forces her for the first time to think of her own life, but it turns out to be only a cyst. The whole incident, though, has shaken her into action, and at movie's end she's heading to Oregon and a new life (maybe).The movie is slow and spare, deliberately so, and at times seems to be weighted down into inertia.

236236,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6300270203,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 3]","""Rachel, Rachel"", which won two Golden Globe Awards back in 1969 for ""Joanne Woodward - Best Motion Picture Actress - Drama"" and ""Paul Newman - Best Motion Picture Director"" and was also nominated for four Academy Awards.The film would feature Paul Newman in his first directorial debut and wife Joanne Woodward as the main actress in a 1968 film that still is relevant today.The film is about a 35-year-old school teacher Rachel Cameron.  Rachel has a ho-hum life.  She lives at home with her mother and takes care of her needs since her mother has a heart condition.  Always at home, Rachel tends to imagine the worst things happening to her.She feels her life is slipping away now that she is 35 and wants to be a normal woman.  To be married, to have children but she's stuck at home.Having to take care of her mother who has a heart condition and thus her life has been just work and taking care of her mother and each year as she gets older, she feels that her life is just continuing to get worse but Rachel, really wants to break out of her shell.I would imagine that this film would strike a chord with many viewers at that time.  I've read of how controversial the film was but with the film 41 years old, so accustomed to seeing things now, you can only imagine how shocking certain things were back then.The film touches upon pregnancy and although not implicit, I would imagine abortion, two women kissing each other (one quick scene) and a use of a device which I am not quite clear what that thing was.  Growing up and either having a life or staying at home and taking care of your aging parents, it was relevant then and it's still relevant now.Paul Newman does a wonderful job for his directorial debut but what truly shined was Joanne Woodward's performance as Rachel.  There were so many layers to this character.  You wonder how miserable she is as an adult.  Why does she dream about when she was young or the time with her father?  Why does she feel compassion for a student who always misses school?  There is sadness but yet a glimpse of happiness and then independence with the character of Rachel.  A wonderful performance!VIDEO & AUDIO:The DVD is featured in a ""matted"" widescreen format preserving the aspect ratio of its original, theatrical exhibition, enhanced for widescreen TV's.  For a 1968 film, the video quality was actually pretty good.  I've seen films in the 70's exhibit a lot of grain but for a late 60's film, it looks as if the video source was kept in good condition and picture quality was overall pretty good.The audio is Dolby Digital stereo.  The film is dialogue-based, so no need for special effects or anything.  There is music which was composed and conducted by Jerome Moross which was quite nice.  But overall,  the audio is all about the acting in this film!SPECIAL FEATURES:""RACHEL, RACHEL"" comes with two special features:* Vintage ""A Jest of God"" Exhibitor Promo Footage (Silent) - About five minutes long, this silent footage features Paul Newman behind the camera and literally behind-the-scenes look at the filming.* Theatrical Trailer - This is not your standard trailer. This trailer starts off with Joanne Woodward winning an Oscar back in 1958 for ""The Three Faces of Eve"" and then the film goes into Paul Newman commenting on the film, working with his wife and his directorial debut.  A different type of trailer that didn't show just scenes from the film but behind-the-scenes photos of Paul Newman working with his wife and the cast.JUDGMENT CALL:The 1968 film ""Rachel, Rachel"" is now available on DVD and part of Warner Bros. ""Paul Newman Film Series"".  One of the films showing tribute by Warner Bros. to Newman (who passed away on Sept. 2008) as an actor and director.""Rachel, Rachel"" is one of those films that an actress is given a chance to shine, that is if she could pull off a complex character such as Rachel.  Joanne Woodward manages to pull it off.Rachel Cameron is a woman that feels that her life of being alone, just taking care of her mother and not having any social life, no man in her life, no children and thus feeling old and her life going downhill.As mentioned, the film was released in 1968 but 41-years later, I feel that this film still has its relevance because anyone who has to make a decision of taking care of their elder parents or have a life.  I don't know how many times I was told by my grandparents that we must succeed in order to take care of our parents as they age.  And for the character of Rachel, her father died at the time she graduated college and thus moved back home to take care of her mother.  Her mother didn't want to be alone.  Her mother felt that her daughter must be there for her at all times because of her heart condition.  And so Rachel, showing her obligations as a daughter and caretaker but at the same time, feeling she was stuck in the small town, stuck caring for her mother.  It was indeed a performance that was acted marvelously by Julianne Woodward.As for Paul Newman, the man knows film.  Having appeared in many films himself, there was no doubt that a popular talent would know what kind of shot he wanted and what performance he wanted to get.  In fact, during the theatrical trailer commentary, he talked about how tough it was for him to direct his wife.  But the two and also the rest of the cast and crew managed to pull it off.I'm sure this film was controversial when it was released in theaters especially during that time in film.  But I would assume the film also was important showing a woman's thoughts, emotions and her gaining the strength to become independent and able to make her own choices.A classic worth watching!",4,"A great collaboration of Paul Newman as director with wife, Joanne Woodward.

She is thirty-five, a virgin, and dominated by her mother... During the summer, she has an affair with an old schoolmate... It proves disappointing, but she now knows that she can be loving, and determines to leave town and do something about her life--a move that seems only tentatively hopeful...Woodward gives her finest performance as the confused, frequently beaten but ultimately indestructible woman... She has an extraordinary ability to look natural or simple and still reveal an inner radiance...There are many touching moments: her timidness at the religious meeting; her awkward experiences with men; her late-night discussion with a likable male friend; and, most unforgettable, her face causing change from joyous expectancy to merely suppressed hysteria to a painful outburst of tears when she discovers that, contrary to her hopes, she is not pregnant...Newman shows a natural cinematic sense in his perceptive depictions of small town life, the frenzied activity of a revival meeting and the anxieties of a first sexual experience; and in his clever, rarely impressive juxtaposition of Rachel's present with her fantasies and childhood memories... He gets excellent performances from Estelle Parsons as another lonely teacher and James Olson as the cynical big-city man who lets Rachel down...Both Newman and Woodward won Golden Globe Awards...

Rachel teaches by day, wearing simple, practical dresses and her hair up. By night she caters to her domineering mother by preparing refreshments for her parties. This sexually repressed spinster schoolteacher, however, gets one last chance at romance in her small Connecticut town. Woodward mixes just the right amounts of loneliness and sweetness in the leading role.

236241,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6300270203,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Joanne Woodward effectively plays a bored and boring middle-aged school teacher who still lives with her mother at a funeral home in Connecticut. She's on the verge of mental collapse, but hides it well and pretends everything's okay. I guy from her childhood comes to town from the big city (James Olson) and her appetite for change comes to the fore.This potent drama was Paul Newman's first stab at directing and it's the best cinematic depiction of the inward struggle of flesh and spirit -- id and superego -- I've ever seen. This struggle explains why it's called &#34;Rachel, Rachel.&#34; Rachel is experiencing the undercurrent conflict between spiritual and carnal impulses. She's stuck between goody-goody Rachel and libertine Rachel and is therefore in living limbo. Various outside factors encourage this lifeless state: Disturbing childhood memories of living in a funeral home, a mother who essentially views Rachel as her personal servant and a genuine friend who's love is starting to become unhealthy (Estelle Parsons).The film features a mind-blowing pentecostal church sequence that lasts 10-12 minutes. I can't believe Newman had the cojones to include this scene and it's pulled off expertly with Terry Kiser as the guest preacher who &#34;speaks in tongues,&#34; which is what Calla (Parsons) tells Rachel when it's reveal that he's the speaker. Parsons is fabulous here, by the way.Due to the subject matter and the fact that this is a drama there are some boring stretches, so you have to be in the mood for a serious drama. Nevertheless, the film deserves credit for having the gonads to show real life and refusing to be politically correct -- an amazing drama.In case you didn't know, Newman and Woodward were husband & wife for 50 years, up to his death in 2008.The film runs 101 minutes and was shot in Connecticut.GRADE: A-",5,Conservative Rachel and libertine Rachel,1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,1853,"['Joanne', 'Woodward', 'effectively', 'bored', 'boring', 'middle-aged', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'still', 'mother', 'funeral', 'home', 'Connecticut', 'verge', 'mental', 'collapse', 'well', 'everything', 'okay', 'guy', 'childhood', 'town', 'big', 'city', 'James', 'Olson', 'appetite', 'change', 'fore.This', 'potent', 'drama', 'was', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'first', 'stab', 'directing', 'best', 'cinematic', 'depiction', 'inward', 'struggle', 'flesh', 'spirit', 'id', 'superego', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'struggle', 'why', 'called', '34', 'Rachel', 'Rachel.', '34', 'Rachel', 'experiencing', 'undercurrent', 'conflict', 'spiritual', 'carnal', 'impulses', 'stuck', 'goody-goody', 'Rachel', 'libertine', 'Rachel', 'therefore', 'living', 'limbo', 'Various', 'outside', 'factors', 'encourage', 'lifeless', 'state', 'Disturbing', 'childhood', 'memories', 'living', 'funeral', 'home', 'mother', 'who', 'essentially', 'Rachel', 'personal', 'servant', 'genuine', 'friend', 'who', 'love', 'starting', 'become', 'unhealthy', 'Estelle', 'Parsons', '.The', 'film', 'mind-blowing', 'pentecostal', 'church', 'sequence', '10-12', 'minutes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Newman', 'had', 'cojones', 'include', 'scene', 'pulled', 'off', 'expertly', 'Terry', 'Kiser', 'guest', 'preacher', 'who', '34', 'speaks', 'tongues', '34', 'what', 'Calla', 'Parsons', 'Rachel', 'when', 'reveal', 'speaker', 'Parsons', 'fabulous', 'here', 'way.Due', 'subject', 'matter', 'fact', 'drama', 'are', 'boring', 'stretches', 'have', 'be', 'mood', 'serious', 'drama', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'credit', 'having', 'gonads', 'show', 'real', 'life', 'refusing', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'amazing', 'drama.In', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Newman', 'Woodward', 'were', 'husband', 'wife', '50', 'years', 'up', 'death', '2008.The', 'film', 'runs', '101', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'Connecticut.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A
