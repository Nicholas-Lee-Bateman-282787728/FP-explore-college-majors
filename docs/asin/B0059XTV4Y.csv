The past scenes were shot beautifully.  I think it is worth watching just for the period filming.  I just didn't think there was much substance to the movie in general.  It seemed more like a fashion show than a movie.,2,Beautifully Filmed But Silly,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,354,"['loved', 'present-day', 'romance', 'took', 'place', 'film', 'alongside', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'Duke', 'Windsor', 'romance', 'past', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'think', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'period', 'filming', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'much', 'substance', 'movie', 'general', 'seemed', 'more', 'fashion', 'show', 'movie']",W.E.
1451690,A1HEXCPIK7F1HE,B0059XTV4Y,AMY6700,"[0, 0]","If  you have any interest in the Windsors, this is a great movie to watch.  The monarchy of England could have been so different if Edward remained the king, this movie gives new insight on Wallis Simpson.I had low expectations, probably because Madonna was the director, so I expected a smutty and vulgar film, but the cinematography and scenery was a big surprise.  There is massive attention to detail- costumes, jewelry, cars, locations, hairstyles, all the little expensive production items that make a film worth watching.  The acting is so-so, however.  Abbie Cornish was great and Andrea Riseborough was superb as Wallis.  James D'Arcy was just ok.  Possibly there could have been a different choice.  I didn't always buy that this man was so obsessed that he gave up the throne of England for her, although that HAS to be hard to convey on film.  Maybe the chemistry was a tad off.  I also didn't like Abbie's severe look with harsh black dyed hair, although I got that they were trying to make her look like Wallis.This is a great story, one of the great love stories of our time, and they told it from Wallis' perspective, which is probably the first time this has been done (with Wallis telling her side).  Although you can't really say &#34;poor Wallis...&#34;, you do get a new perspective, and don't just write her off as the most hated pariah of her time.  This story needed to be told, Edward's abdication was UNHEARD of, and he was pressured.  How easy it was to place all the blame on Wallis.  As you find out through the film, she did give up a lot as well.  They were banished from England from a long time, stripped of royal dignity and became laughingstocks of the time.The way the movie moves between past and present is easy to follow, although I don't know if the Abbie Cornish storyline was necessary, I think the movie could have been told strictly through Wallis' eyes.  I also think the movie got negative publicity because Madonna is attached to it.  I think if they would have made this movie through the BBC or even a Masterpiece mini series it could have been phenomenal.",4,"Very good, however Wallis/Edward story could have stood on its own without the modern day parallel",1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,2105,"['have', 'interest', 'Windsors', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'monarchy', 'England', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'different', 'Edward', 'remained', 'king', 'movie', 'new', 'insight', 'Wallis', 'Simpson.I', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'probably', 'Madonna', 'was', 'director', 'so', 'expected', 'smutty', 'vulgar', 'film', 'cinematography', 'scenery', 'was', 'big', 'surprise', 'massive', 'attention', 'detail-', 'costumes', 'jewelry', 'cars', 'locations', 'hairstyles', 'little', 'expensive', 'production', 'items', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'acting', 'so-so', 'however', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'was', 'great', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'was', 'superb', 'Wallis', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'was', 'just', 'ok', 'Possibly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'choice', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'buy', 'man', 'was', 'so', 'obsessed', 'gave', 'up', 'throne', 'England', 'be', 'hard', 'convey', 'film', 'Maybe', 'chemistry', 'was', 'tad', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'Abbie', 'severe', 'look', 'harsh', 'black', 'dyed', 'hair', 'got', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'look', 'Wallis.This', 'great', 'story', 'one', 'great', 'love', 'stories', 'time', 'told', 'Wallis', 'perspective', 'probably', 'first', 'time', 'been', 'done', 'Wallis', 'telling', 'side', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', '34', 'poor', 'Wallis', '34', 'do', 'get', 'new', 'perspective', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'write', 'off', 'most', 'hated', 'pariah', 'time', 'story', 'needed', 'be', 'told', 'Edward', 'abdication', 'was', 'UNHEARD', 'was', 'pressured', 'How', 'easy', 'was', 'place', 'blame', 'Wallis', 'find', 'out', 'film', 'did', 'give', 'up', 'lot', 'well', 'were', 'banished', 'England', 'long', 'time', 'stripped', 'royal', 'dignity', 'became', 'laughingstocks', 'time.The', 'way', 'movie', 'past', 'present', 'easy', 'follow', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'storyline', 'was', 'necessary', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'strictly', 'Wallis', 'eyes', 'also', 'think', 'movie', 'got', 'negative', 'publicity', 'Madonna', 'attached', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'BBC', 'even', 'Masterpiece', 'mini', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'phenomenal']",W.E.

She has also been involved in movies, and her career in Hollywood has not been as successful as she probably wished. So it was a surprise that she got green-lighted to direct W.E.,"" a period film, with a moderate budget - big risk, I would say. But the movie, I believe, works. It is an honest, passionate and elegant look at one of the most controversial romances of all time.The film's main story is about the love affair between King Edward VIII (James D'Arcy) and Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough). However, instead of telling the story as is, Madonna chose to include a parallel, contemporary story involving Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) and William Winthrop (Richard Coyle). The film opens with Wallis Simpson waiting for her first husband, Winfield Spencer, to have dinner together. He shows up late and is unhappy that his dinner is not served. He beats Wallis, who is pregnant, causing a miscarriage. We then move to 1998, and meet Wally Winthrop, who is also waiting for her husband, to have dinner together, something that also doesn't happen. In this case, her husband was having fun with other ladies. In her lonesomeness, Wally (who was named after Wallis Simpson), visits an exhibition featuring King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson's memorabilia, which would later be sold in an auction. While viewing the objects, she daydreams about their famous romance, in which King Edward VIII surrendered his crown to marry Wallis, a twice-divorced American woman. It was a scandal at the time, which caused the couple to live in exile. The rest of the movie deals with Wally's problems with her husband, intertwined with aspects of the royal controversy.""W.E."" is quite stylish and with a great, eclectic soundtrack. I found the comparisons of both couple's problems very interesting. And this is understandable, as Madonna Louise Ciccone has been known to be vocal on women's rights. This film, in addition of being about the King Edward VIII-Simpson sacrilegious romance, is also about courageous women and true love. I would venture to say that this film should be viewed together with ""The King's Speech,"" also a Weinstein production/Anchor Bay release, because it deals with the Duke of York, the brother that succeeded and inherited King Edward VIII's throne.

1451699,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B0059XTV4Y,Charity Bishop,"[6, 9]","There are two sides to every story, and in this carefully crafted biopic merged with fiction, Madonna tries to tell us the story of Wallis Simpson, the commoner a monarch left his kingdom to marry. Though maligned by the critics, W.E. is an exquisite film.Young Wally (Abbie Cornish) has inherited more from Wallis Simpson than her name. Her mother and grandmother were obsessed with the American divorcee, and so is Wally. Once an employee at a world-renowned auction house, now an upper society housewife with too much time on her hands, she is in a marriage of convenience for security and longs for a romance like Wallis had. Her psychologist husband (Richard Coyle) spends most of his time at work... or with his cell phone off, leaving her to pace her beautiful upper Manhattan apartment and dream.In the late 1930's, Wallis (Andrea Riseborough) is married to a good-natured man after a disastrous first marriage that ended in abuse and left her unable to bear children. Though suffering from a bad cold, she insists on being present at a party in which His Royal Majesty the Prince of Wales, ""David"" (James D'Arcy) to his family and friends, is in attendance. There are immediate sparks between them, but for a time Wallis merely ""looks after him"" for one of her friends. But when that friendship turns into something more, their love affair threatens to tear a nation apart on the eve of war.Critics have slammed this film for everything from its directorial style to the script. I happen to think they are all wrong. For a debut film by a first-time director, this is a masterpiece. Madonna knows movement and how to use it. She knows how to tell a story through female protagonists. She knows how to tug on our heartstrings and make a woman overshadowed by scandal and rumors a likable figure. That is what she did for me: she took a scandalous, notorious woman and made me like her. Not just a little bit, but a lot. Films from this era take a position on the scandal, either in favor of it or against it. This one doesn't. It presents the relationship for what it was, a unique and at times absurd affair. Yes, it is somewhat soft on their fondness for socializing and does its best to gloss over their Nazi empathies, but never did it feel overly defensive or contrived. In the end, it is a film about normal people who just happen to have titles attached to their names.The past setting is exquisite, with beautifully crafted costumes, jewelry, and a perfect cast that expands to include Laurence Fox, Natalie Dormer, and Oscar Isaac. If there is one fault with the script, it is that most of it revolves around present time and Wally, while her story is less interesting than that of Wallis. I raised my brow a bit to find out that the past and present characters would interact, but it works out well, with their lives intersecting and paralleling one another from time to time. I would have liked a bit more with Wallis and David, but there is enough. The musical score is also beautiful, ranging from passionate piano pieces to more modern pop songs. But rather than being jarring, they give us a sense of excitement and fun.Either this is a movie you are going to love, or hate. Much like public opinion on the romance itself, there is no middle ground. It glosses over some of the unsavory aspects of this couple (such as David's meanness to his brother Bertie) but doesn't hesitate to show us the brutal truth about everything Wallis went through. David may have given up his throne to be with her... but she gave up everything else.Parental Concerns: brief backside nudity, a scene in which a man drags a woman naked from a bathtub and beats her up (resulting in a miscarriage). 5 f-words, one abuse of Jesus' name.",4,Changed My Thoughts on Wallis Simpson,1336003200,"05 3, 2012",2012,3737,"['are', 'two', 'sides', 'story', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'biopic', 'merged', 'fiction', 'Madonna', 'tell', 'story', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'commoner', 'monarch', 'left', 'kingdom', 'marry', 'Though', 'maligned', 'critics', 'W.E', 'exquisite', 'film.Young', 'Wally', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'inherited', 'more', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'name', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'were', 'obsessed', 'American', 'divorcee', 'so', 'Wally', 'Once', 'employee', 'world-renowned', 'auction', 'house', 'now', 'upper', 'society', 'housewife', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'security', 'longs', 'romance', 'Wallis', 'had', 'psychologist', 'husband', 'Richard', 'Coyle', 'most', 'time', 'work', 'cell', 'phone', 'leaving', 'pace', 'beautiful', 'upper', 'Manhattan', 'apartment', 'dream.In', 'late', '1930', 'Wallis', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'married', 'good-natured', 'man', 'disastrous', 'first', 'marriage', 'ended', 'abuse', 'left', 'unable', 'bear', 'children', 'suffering', 'bad', 'cold', 'being', 'present', 'party', 'Royal', 'Majesty', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'David', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'family', 'friends', 'attendance', 'are', 'immediate', 'sparks', 'time', 'Wallis', 'merely', 'looks', 'one', 'friends', 'when', 'friendship', 'something', 'more', 'love', 'affair', 'tear', 'nation', 'apart', 'eve', 'war.Critics', 'have', 'slammed', 'film', 'everything', 'directorial', 'style', 'script', 'happen', 'think', 'are', 'wrong', 'debut', 'film', 'first-time', 'director', 'masterpiece', 'Madonna', 'movement', 'how', 'use', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'female', 'protagonists', 'how', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'make', 'woman', 'overshadowed', 'scandal', 'rumors', 'likable', 'figure', 'what', 'did', 'took', 'scandalous', 'notorious', 'woman', 'made', 'Not', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'lot', 'Films', 'era', 'take', 'position', 'scandal', 'either', 'favor', 'one', ""n't"", 'relationship', 'what', 'was', 'unique', 'times', 'absurd', 'affair', 'Yes', 'somewhat', 'soft', 'fondness', 'socializing', 'best', 'gloss', 'over', 'Nazi', 'empathies', 'never', 'did', 'feel', 'overly', 'defensive', 'contrived', 'end', 'film', 'normal', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'have', 'titles', 'attached', 'names.The', 'past', 'setting', 'exquisite', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'costumes', 'jewelry', 'perfect', 'cast', 'include', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'one', 'fault', 'script', 'most', 'present', 'time', 'Wally', 'story', 'less', 'interesting', 'Wallis', 'raised', 'brow', 'bit', 'find', 'out', 'past', 'present', 'characters', 'would', 'interact', 'out', 'well', 'lives', 'intersecting', 'paralleling', 'one', 'time', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'bit', 'more', 'Wallis', 'David', 'enough', 'musical', 'score', 'also', 'beautiful', 'ranging', 'passionate', 'piano', 'pieces', 'more', 'modern', 'pop', 'songs', 'rather', 'being', 'jarring', 'give', 'sense', 'excitement', 'fun.Either', 'movie', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'hate', 'Much', 'public', 'opinion', 'romance', 'middle', 'ground', 'unsavory', 'aspects', 'couple', 'such', 'David', 'meanness', 'brother', 'Bertie', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'show', 'brutal', 'truth', 'everything', 'Wallis', 'went', 'David', 'may', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'throne', 'be', 'gave', 'up', 'everything', 'else.Parental', 'Concerns', 'brief', 'backside', 'nudity', 'scene', 'man', 'woman', 'naked', 'bathtub', 'up', 'resulting', 'miscarriage', '5', 'f-words', 'one', 'abuse', 'Jesus', 'name']",W.E.

1451706,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B0059XTV4Y,Dr. James Gardner,"[13, 27]","If you're a fan of films like ""The King's Speech"" (2010), ""The Queen"" (2006), and ""Anonymous"" (2011) that give you a peek behind the screen of the royal family, you're going to be woefully disappointed in ""W.E."", a 2012 film about the love affair between King Edward VIII and a married American woman, Wallis Simpson - an affair that led to Edward's abdication in December 1936 and the ascension of George VI whose eldest daughter Elizabeth, reigned for more than 50 years and as of this date, remains on the throne.In addition to a cursory examination of the Wallis/Edward (hence W.E.) affair, there is a concurrent story about a former Sotheby researcher who is obsessed with the story, not only because she was named after Wallis, but also because her own marriage is under strain and she hopes in some way that learning more about Wallis and Edward may assist her.Two half told stories do not a good film make. Indeed, half told tales diminish rather than enhance a film, so that the two parts of this film - Edward and Wallis in the 1930s and Wally and William in the present - really do injustice to both stories.But all is not lost, because the contemporary story gives us a look at a really fine actress, Australia born Abbie Cornish whose work has been primarily in Australian and British TV and films. Cornish plays the modern day Wallis, and she does such a fine sensitive job that I wish this were a film about her, rather than a device to serve as a counter point to the Wallis/Edward affair.James D'Arcy plays King Edward. D'Arcy had primarily been a British TV actor. He's probably best known for co-starring in ""Master and Commander"" (2003) as 1st Lt. Tom Pullings.Pretty Andrea Riseborough plays Simpson. She was nominated for a BAFTA for the TV movie ""Margaret Thatcher"" The Long Walk to Finchley"" (2008) and the British Independent Film Society nominated her for ""Most Promising Newcomer"" for ""Brighton Rock"" (2010). She is virtually unknown to US audiences.James Fox, who plays King George V, is the only well known actor (""Patriot Games"", ""The Servant"", ""A Passage to India""), but if you sneeze you'll miss him.Given the talented actors, what went wrong? Apart from the half told tale problem alluded to above, perhaps the major fault with the film is that it is virtually impossible to see what attracted Edward to Wallis. The film ignores anything to do with the central question - why would a man give up a kingdom for a woman? The film continually tells us that Edward is obsessed with Wallis, and it shows us Edward being obsessed with Wallis, but we are left to wonder why. In an aside, it's suggested that she dressed better than anyone else, and as seemingly silly as this may be, it is the only clue we have.There's another problem with the film, and this is the continual shifting between real footage (news reels and newspapers) of Edwards and Wallis and reconstructed footage with the actors superimposed. There seems to be no pattern to when this happens, leading me to think that they simply ran out of money to complete the task. As presented, the shift is jarring and is a constant reminder that we are watching a film with actors - a deadly thrust at the heart of any film.All these problems can be laid at the foot of writer/director Madonna who is best known as a singer, although her second career in film is also notable. She acted in more than 20 films, winning a Golden Globe for ""Evita"" (1996) although winning a Razzie (worst actress) for ""Swept Away"" (2002), ""Die Another Day"" (2002), ""The Next Best Thing"" (2000), ""Four Rooms"" (1995), ""Body of Evidence"" (1993), ""Who's That Girl"" (1987) and ""Shanghai Surprise"" (1986).W.E. is her fourth film as a writer and second film as a director. None of her other efforts received any type of award, although W.E. did get an Oscar nomination for Costume Design.Of course the film is not totally without merit. It is visually attractive and it's always good to get a peek at actors who otherwise appear on TV and films in other countries. There are also a few moments when the camerawork is exceptional as it visually tracks extreme closeups of facial features while underscoring the theme offered in the scene (something Sergio Leone did very well in a very different context). But these few crumbs will not provide sufficient sustenance for a 2+ hour film.Roger Ebert called it ""an elegant, ambitious and relentlessly monotonous film"" and said ""there is little human interest or excitement."" The Hollywood Reporter called it ""as easy on the eyes and ears as it is embalmed from any dramatic point of view.""The film opened in February 2012 and did less than $50,000 in its opening weekend. Poor as this may appear, films like this generally don't do well when they open - ""The Queen"" (2006) made only $122,014 and ""The King's Speech"" made $355,450. ""Anonymous"" was an exception with more than $1 million.Bottom line - a dull film that offers no insight into the Wallis/Edward affair.",2,Dull and lacking insight,1331078400,"03 7,

SIMPSON with Edward Fox in the title role.  Madonna's version of the tale juxtaposes the story with a present-day tale involving Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish), her violent husband William (Richard Voyle) and a Russian intellectual employed at Sotheby's in New York, Evgeni (Oscar Isaac).  The parallels are obvious enough: Wally identifies with Mrs. Simpson and contrasts her own mundane existence with that of the royal lover.  Eventually she comes to realize that she has the kind of life-choices denied to Mrs. Simpson.  Shot in rock-video style, with fast cuts preventing any real identification with the characters, W.E. actually seems like an attempt by director Madonna to make sense of her own life as a singer/actress/celebrity.  The settings are well drawn; the performances competent (even though D'Arcy looks nothing like the real Duke of Windsor).

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[4, 8]","Wallis Warfield Simpson was one of the most controversial figures of the 20th century -- a twice-divorced American whose love affair with King Edward VIII led to his abdication.So you would THINK that even Madonna could wring a decent dramatic movie out of the woman. Some passion, some intensity, some controversy... SOMETHING. But ""W.E."" ends up being a choppy, jumbled affair that leaves you desperately hoping for something other than total fluff. And you never, ever get it.It's not actually the story of Wallis herself, but of Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish), the wife of a wealthy doctor in present-day New York. Wally's husband neglects her (he's obviously having an affair) and doesn't want to have a baby with her, so she wanders to Sotheby's to ogle the for-sale possessions of the legendary Duchess of Windsor.She also falls in love with an attentive Russian guard after a savage beatdown by her husband. For some reason, she also starts... hallucinating? Seeing visions? Communing with the ghost of Wallis?Well, whatever happened, she starts seeing Wallis' (Andrea Riseborough) past -- her introduction to the Prince of Wales (James D'Arcy), the affair that sprang up, the glamorous life they had together, and his obsessive love for her that led him to abdicate, even though Wallis was desperate for him not to do so.Anyone expecting a semi-balanced depiction of Wallis and Edward should keep looking, because  ""W.E."" is basically a cinematic fanfic written by a starry-eyed Wallis fangirl. Wallis and Edward are shiny, perfect, idealized dolls who are everything noble and glamorous, and anyone who dislikes them is just a mean ol' hater who irrationally loathes poor wittle Wallis.In fact, Madonna is so wedded to this depiction that she either ignores (Wallis' other affairs, her botched abortion) or dismisses (Nazi sympathies) every imperfection that either of them had. She tries to justify it with a cache of fictional ""secret"" letters, but it all rings hollow.Sadly, the rest of the movie is all flashy, glamorous prettiness with no substance. Madonna's direction is a constant assault of choppy, fragmented edits -- for instance, an intimate kiss between Wallis and Edward is interrupted by a random pan right up a palm tree. The most surreal? A drug-fueled scene where Wallis hikes up her dress and does a suggestive dance with another woman... IN FRONT OF A CROWD.And on the rare occasions when Madonna DOES try to give us a deep emotional moment, it comes across as artificial and clumsy (""People seem to only focus on what he gave up for her. But what about what she gave up?""). It's like a teenage ""Twilight"" fan directed this.As the final indignity, Wallis' complex story is just window-dressing for the story of Wally. Madonna tries to ram the ""similarities"" down our throat (Wally's rotten husband is referred to as ""our own Prince of Wales""), but in the end there is almost nothing in common between these two women. So, they're alike because their marriages didn't work? That's all? Who CARES about Wally?The actors... well, they do the best they can.

Wally Winthrop, a rich, married and miserable New Yorker, finds solace in an exhibition recently opened at Sotheby's celebrating the circa 1930's romance of then Prince Edward and Wallis Simpson, an American woman for whose love he forfeited his throne.And by that feeble thread hangs this hollow bauble of a film.  From Cartier jewelry boxes and bottles of Chanel No. 5 to repeated flashes of uncorked Mot, every frame is a page from Vanity Fair.  The present-day Wally seemingly exists for no other purpose than to justify these gratuitous advertisements: she once had a job at Sotheby's, yet even the unhappy marriage for which she gave it up has not dulled her eye for the finer things.  Indeed, when she's not moping about her impossibly posh apartment she's moping about in Sotheby's, bringing herself to tears as she covets the luxurious artifacts from Wallis's and Edward's life together.  And once their romance is (rather quickly) established as the excuse for Wally to indulge her predilection, it only takes one awful dialogue - there are many of these, but the one that follows is perhaps the most audacious (and therefore the worst) - to drag the film from rather absurd into quite absurd: a security guard from Sotheby's has developed a crush on Wally, and he approaches her one day after an auction:Guard: So are you or aren't you?Wally: Huh?Guard: Going to bid on something?Wally: Oh god no!Guard: Why?Wally: Too nerve-wrecking.And that's as tense as it gets, I'm afraid.  No wait.  The next day Wally bids $10,000 on a pair of Wallis Simpson's gloves.  Some pantomime spousal abuse is then shoe-horned in to give Wally's story some gravitas.  As for Prince Edward, his devotion to Wallis Simpson becomes so slavish that it's embarrassing.  Historically accurate or artistic license?  I haven't bothered to check, but it's cringingly insipid either way.In conclusion, this is an altogether pointless film in that, when it isn't advertising in its artistically artless way, it depicts improbable persons suffering unbelievable traumas.Clearly intended as a stopgap for Sex and the City 3.",1,W.E.ak fantasy,1336521600,"05 9, 2012",2012,2190,"['***SPOILERS***W.E.althy', 'people', 'Beautiful', 'people', 'W.E.ary', 'people.The', 'year', '1998', 'Wally', 'Winthrop', 'rich', 'married', 'miserable', 'New', 'Yorker', 'solace', 'exhibition', 'recently', 'opened', 'Sotheby', 'celebrating', 'circa', '1930', 'romance', 'then', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'American', 'woman', 'love', 'forfeited', 'throne.And', 'feeble', 'thread', 'hangs', 'hollow', 'bauble', 'film', 'Cartier', 'jewelry', 'boxes', 'bottles', 'Chanel', 'No', '5', 'repeated', 'flashes', 'uncorked', 'Mot', 'frame', 'page', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'present-day', 'Wally', 'seemingly', 'other', 'purpose', 'justify', 'gratuitous', 'advertisements', 'once', 'had', 'job', 'Sotheby', 'yet', 'even', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'gave', 'up', 'not', 'dulled', 'eye', 'finer', 'things', 'Indeed', 'when', 'not', 'moping', 'impossibly', 'posh', 'apartment', 'moping', 'about', 'Sotheby', 'bringing', 'tears', 'luxurious', 'artifacts', 'Wallis', 'Edward', 'life', 'together', 'once', 'romance', 'rather', 'quickly', 'established', 'excuse', 'Wally', 'indulge', 'predilection', 'only', 'one', 'awful', 'dialogue', 'are', 'many', 'one', 'perhaps', 'most', 'audacious', 'therefore', 'worst', 'drag', 'film', 'rather', 'absurd', 'quite', 'absurd', 'security', 'guard', 'Sotheby', 'developed', 'crush', 'Wally', 'one', 'day', 'auction', 'Guard', 'are', 'are', ""n't"", 'Wally', 'Huh', 'Guard', 'Going', 'bid', 'something', 'Wally', 'Oh', 'Guard', 'Why', 'Wally', 'Too', 'nerve-wrecking.And', 'as', 'tense', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'wait', 'next', 'day', 'Wally', '10,000', 'pair', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'gloves', 'pantomime', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'then', 'shoe-horned', 'give', 'Wally', 'story', 'gravitas', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'devotion', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'so', 'slavish', 'embarrassing', 'Historically', 'accurate', 'artistic', 'license', 'have', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'check', 'cringingly', 'insipid', 'way.In', 'conclusion', 'altogether', 'pointless', 'film', 'when', ""n't"", 'advertising', 'artistically', 'artless', 'way', 'improbable', 'persons', 'suffering', 'unbelievable', 'traumas.Clearly', 'intended', 'stopgap', 'Sex', 'City', '3']",W.E.
1451714,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0059XTV4Y,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","The much maligned, brief theatrical film by Madonna - W.E. - fairs better on the small screen than it likely did in the movie houses. The stories are bifurcated, each one resembling a television creation - one a docudrama biopic, the other a contemporary soap opera. That Madonna, who directed and wrote the screenplay with Alek Keshishian, decided to mix the two stories is a bit daring but in some ways it works very well. In other ways the parallel stories seem like time traveling cars on the same highway that never quite travel at the same speed or quality.The film mixes the notorious affair between King Edward VIII and American divorc&eacute;e Wallis Simpson with a contemporary romance between a married woman and a Russian security guard. The time is 1998 and at an auction of the estate of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor unhappily married ex-Sotheby employee Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) becomes obsessed by their historic love story. Her own marriage to womanizing, abusive psychiatrist William (Richard Coyle) undermines her feelings of worth and as she learns more about the sacrifices involved in the famous affair, she gains her own courage to find happiness.The film flips back and forth between the present and the 1930s and it is the historical aspect of the film that is almost flawless. We get to know Wallis Simpson (in a brilliant portrayal by Andrea Riseborough) and understand her failed first two marriages (at the time we meet her she is still married to Ernest Simpson played by David Harbour), and see the American sizzle that made her the talk of England. When Wallis wrangles her way to meet Prince Edward, better known as David, (James D'Arcy) there is a chemistry that develops to the point of passion and ultimately leads to Wallis divorcing Ernest to marry Edward - a deed that leads to Edward's abdication of the throne for `the woman I love', which he had assumed when King George V (James Fox) dies, to his stammering brother Bertie (Laurence Fox) and his caustic wife Elizabeth (Natalie Dormer). The paparazzi make their life miserable and the couple is not allowed to return to England until Edward dies, with the faithful Wallis supportively by his side through 36 years of marriage.Wally - meanwhile - longs to be pregnant but sustains such abuse from William that she ultimately yields to the loving friendship the auction house Russian security guard Evgeni (Oscar Isaac) and begins her life again. The two stories are connected by Wally's obsession with the royal couple's notorious affair and at auction's end she is given access to private letters between Wallis and Edward that have been in the possession of Mohamed Al-Fayed (Haluk Bilginer) - a tacked on ending that feels ill at ease and redundant.Everyone connected to the biopic angle of this film is excellent and Madonna shows that she knows how to direct affairs of the heart in a royal situation very well indeed. Both Andrea Riseborough and James D'Arcy are superb and the costumes and music and cinematography of this historical portion are exceptionally well done. Though the idea of the contemporary sluggish story is reasonable, Abbie Cornish seems uncomfortable with the script: Oscar Isaac shines as her new love. In all the film, though spotty, has merit and it not a bad debut for Madonna as director.

1451715,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B0059XTV4Y,Jack E. Levic,"[3, 4]","I was looking forward to W.E. thinking it was a historical drama based on the love story of the 20th Century. The King of England renounced his throne to be with the woman he loved. What could make a better story?Unfortunately, Madonna's version is scrambled between fact, fiction and fantasy. The first minutes were confusing as two parallel stories are running. It is the story of Wallis and Edward but it is also the story of Wally, a woman trapped in a loveless marriage in the late 90's dreaming of the romance her namesake enjoyed.So much potential is missed in this story and often fascinating aspects of the royal love affair are glazed over. We are taken back and forth between stories as Wally connects items at the Duke and Duchess auction at Sotheby's. Wally looks at a tablecloth and that is the transition to the past as that tablecloth is being laid for a dinner party held by the Duke and Duchess.Kudos should be given to the costume designer and art director of this film. They do take us back to an authentic feeling 1930's England. The detail is remarkable so it is disappointing that this film needs to tell two parallel stories without concentrating on one story. It would be beyond fascinating to be taken deeper into the mind of Wallis Simpson. Just as her king gave up his throne, she gave up all semblances of the life she knew to live a semi-nomadic life as an outcast. David, as he was lovingly known by his family, could not return to England and was all but banished by his family. It would have been intriguing to further explore his relationship with his German-born mother Queen Mary and his relationship with his brother and sister-in-law who ascended the thrown after his abdication. George VI, the current Queen of England's father, is portrayed as a weak and ineffectual man prone to stuttering while his wife, Queen Elizabeth (later to be known as the Queen Mother) is potrayed as rather vile, domineering and heartless. What was the real story?The idea that once Edward (aka David) abdicated there was no turning back for Wallis Simpson. She was now forever tied to the ex-king. Nothing could be changed and she was destined to be his wife. How happy was the marriage? Was she manipulated by a needy husband who had literally given up the world for her?Our modern Wally begins to unravel the truth in this not so fairy tale romance. She ""interacts"" with Wallis as if the two are one and she begins to understand Wallis in a symptathetic way that has never been seen before. Wallis is no longer the evil twice-divorced dragon who almost tore an empire apart. She did not want Edward to abdicate, yet he did and the rest was hisory.Obviously, this film is visually stunning in its scenes from the 1930's. The elegate jewelry and clothing of the Duchess show that an ordinary looking woman can become an object of stunning beauty and inspiration. The film is just lost in its need to run a parallel story set in modern times.

1451716,A1V3TRGWOMA8LC,B0059XTV4Y,"James Beswick ""Thanks for your time""","[4, 5]","Andrea Riseborough rescues this film, providing a portrayal of Wallis Simpson that elevates her storyline from two-dimensional melodrama to fine art. The historical part is well shot and for the most part quite engaging although doesn't really offer anything particularly new. The theme of the film is that the rich and famous aren't worth associating with and it's better to get connected with true salt-of-the-earth types which may be true but seems somewhat forced given the historical context.The modern day B-story is a disaster. Abbie Cornish gets routinely beaten up by her husband, mirroring Wallis' opening scene, and there's little explanation about how these two women are connected other than their dismally abusive spouses. Supposedly an auction of Wallis and Edward's personal items provides the flashback opportunity for Cornish's character who's for no reason obsessed with their history. It's a weak plot device and might have worked if the modern story had any substance whatsoever. And the predictably feminist angle that Madonna injects feels out of place in the historical storyline and creates risably thin detestable men in the modern plot.This isn't a bad film and has elements of being a great movie. The score is atmospheric if slightly overbearing at times. It's dressed up beautifully and looks every part as good as The King's Speech. Even the dialog is mostly very good and then occasionally stumbles with anachronistic terms that remind you that it's good but uneven.

E. directed and co-written by Madonna.Although panned by critics and burdened with dismal box-office receipts, Madonna's glossy ensemble drama of a young 1990's lonely New Yorker who juxtaposes her life with the famous American divorcee Wallis Warfield Simpson has several redeeming features.After all the films about the Dutchess of Windsor-and all the books-a new and fresh look!W. E. has at its center the Sotheby 1998 Windsor auction in NYC...from the Al Fayed collection.Wally Winthrop is not a typical housewife. A former employee of Sotheby's of New York, she has accepted a generous allowance from an abusive and philandering psychiatrist husband to stay at home. She is also obsessed by the ultimate love story of Edward VIII's abdication for a dark, beautiful, slight American beauty some six decades ago. On her almost daily visits to the Sotheby auction, she meets and falls in love with a Russian security guard. She also purchases a pair of the Duchess's white leather gloves for an astounding sum.The film is well cast....especially the two Wally's. Abbie Cornish as Wally Winthrop and Andrea Riseborough as the Duchess give amazing performances. The costumes and jewelry are spectacular and the title song ""Masterpiece"" is haunting. ""Masterpiece"" won a Golden Globe and was short-listed for the Academy Awards' Best Original Song. Costume design was critically acclaimed and nominated for an Oscar. Two of the Fox acting dynasty family played important roles. Laurence Fox is Bertie and his father James Fox portrays George V. Although I was not too pleased with James D'Arcy's role as the former king of England...it's really coincidental...or is it?...that my favorite Edward VIII is Edward Fox (the brother of James Fox) in the 1978 British mini-seriesEdward & Mrs. Simpson.The morals of this tale: Be careful for what you wish...history can be misleading in matters of the heart.Jane",4,Wally and the Duchess of Windsor....,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,1963,"['Valentine', 'present', 'romantics', 'review', 'movie', 'W.', 'E.', 'directed', 'co-written', 'Madonna.Although', 'panned', 'critics', 'burdened', 'dismal', 'box-office', 'receipts', 'Madonna', 'glossy', 'ensemble', 'drama', 'young', '1990', 'lonely', 'New', 'Yorker', 'who', 'life', 'famous', 'American', 'divorcee', 'Wallis', 'Warfield', 'Simpson', 'several', 'redeeming', 'features.After', 'films', 'Dutchess', 'Windsor-and', 'books-a', 'new', 'fresh', 'look', 'W', 'E.', 'center', 'Sotheby', '1998', 'Windsor', 'auction', 'NYC', 'Al', 'Fayed', 'collection.Wally', 'Winthrop', 'not', 'typical', 'housewife', 'former', 'employee', 'Sotheby', 'New', 'York', 'accepted', 'generous', 'allowance', 'abusive', 'philandering', 'psychiatrist', 'husband', 'stay', 'home', 'also', 'obsessed', 'ultimate', 'love', 'story', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'abdication', 'dark', 'beautiful', 'slight', 'American', 'beauty', 'six', 'decades', 'ago', 'almost', 'daily', 'visits', 'Sotheby', 'auction', 'love', 'Russian', 'security', 'guard', 'also', 'purchases', 'pair', 'Duchess', 'white', 'leather', 'gloves', 'astounding', 'sum.The', 'film', 'well', 'cast', '.especially', 'two', 'Wally', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'Wally', 'Winthrop', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'Duchess', 'give', 'amazing', 'performances', 'costumes', 'jewelry', 'are', 'spectacular', 'title', 'song', 'Masterpiece', 'haunting', 'Masterpiece', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'was', 'short-listed', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Original', 'Song', 'Costume', 'design', 'was', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Two', 'Fox', 'acting', 'dynasty', 'family', 'played', 'important', 'roles', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'Bertie', 'father', 'James', 'Fox', 'George', 'V.', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'pleased', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'role', 'former', 'king', 'England', 'really', 'coincidental', 'favorite', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'brother', 'James', 'Fox', '1978', 'British', 'mini-seriesEdward', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson.The', 'morals', 'tale', 'Be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'history', 'can', 'be', 'misleading', 'matters', 'heart.Jane']",W.E.
1451718,A2VF18R0GPVA2J,B0059XTV4Y,"Janet Swanborn ""virtualcleo""","[5, 6]","By modern American standards, our modern-day heroine, Wally, married a prince. She's not yet thirty and married to a psychiatrist who keeps her in luxury--and behaves as if he owns her. He ignores her, abuses her, cheats on her, and won't let her spend his money or earn her own. He is wholly unsympathetic with her attempts at starting a family (she shoots up fertility drugs on the sly). And his name begins with a ""W""--as did that of the Duchess of Windsor's abusive first husband, Win Spencer.Wally was named after Wallis Simpson, and has internalized the message that a ""great love"" will make life into a bowl of cherries. Wally is a former Sotheby's employee who, after a six-year absence, starts hanging around Sotheby's when they feature the Windsors' possessions in 1998. In the meantime, she rekindles a neglected work friendship. Her white-collar friend, Tenten, chides Wally about her desire to be back at Sotheby's, working for ""no"" money. Enter a new, BLUE-collar Sotheby's friend: a security guard. And his name begins with an ""E""--as did that of Wallis' loving and beloved second husband, Ernest Simpson.Wally goes into daydreams (that just might have a psychic element) while admiring and handling the Windsors' possessions, and thus she lives though early 20th-century scenes in Wallis' life. A couple of times, Wallis Simpson talks to her. In due course, Wally secures permission to read some of the Duchess' unpublished letters, and learns that Wallis really loved and wanted to keep her second husband. (This is the belief of Anne Sebba, author of THAT WOMAN, a recent Wallis Windsor biography.) Wally starts to see parallels between her marriage and Wallis' disastrous first one.Madonna, as director and writer, postulates that the premarital relationship between Edward and Wallis was chaste. Most people think this is preposterous, but it's what Edward claimed. Madonna runs with it. The relationship between Wally and her security guard is chaste, too, as long as her marriage really lasts.There are errors of fact that I can't help believing are deliberate: A fake newsreel that refers to George V as George III and refers to Edward VIII as having been ""crowned."" But Madonna knows her material, and I think that in a fine-tuned labor of love like this, such errors are meant to show the deafness and crudeness of the press.Most of us know something of the Edward/Wallis story, but too many know too little. Therefore, I should be less astounded than I am at the critics who don't get this movie. They literally don't understand what the auteur is trying to say. This is a symmetrical work of art with a definite point of view. Madonna does not HAVE to be right in all her facts; indeed, some can only be guessed at. She chooses her interpretation like a historical novelist.I have not come close to doing justice to all the strands in this lovely cobweb of a movie.",5,"Ignore the Critics, 'Cause They Don't Get It",1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,2892,"['modern', 'American', 'standards', 'modern-day', 'heroine', 'Wally', 'married', 'prince', 'not', 'yet', 'thirty', 'married', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'luxury', 'behaves', 'cheats', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'spend', 'money', 'earn', 'own', 'wholly', 'unsympathetic', 'attempts', 'starting', 'family', 'up', 'fertility', 'drugs', 'sly', 'name', 'W', 'did', 'Duchess', 'Windsor', 'abusive', 'first', 'husband', 'Win', 'Spencer.Wally', 'was', 'named', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'internalized', 'message', 'great', 'love', 'will', 'make', 'life', 'bowl', 'cherries', 'Wally', 'former', 'Sotheby', 'employee', 'who', 'six-year', 'absence', 'hanging', 'Sotheby', 'when', 'feature', 'Windsors', 'possessions', '1998', 'meantime', 'neglected', 'work', 'friendship', 'white-collar', 'friend', 'Tenten', 'Wally', 'desire', 'be', 'back', 'Sotheby', 'working', 'money', 'Enter', 'new', 'BLUE-collar', 'Sotheby', 'friend', 'security', 'guard', 'name', 'E', 'did', 'Wallis', 'loving', 'beloved', 'second', 'husband', 'Ernest', 'Simpson.Wally', 'daydreams', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'psychic', 'element', 'admiring', 'handling', 'Windsors', 'possessions', 'thus', 'early', '20th-century', 'scenes', 'Wallis', 'life', 'couple', 'times', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'talks', 'due', 'course', 'Wally', 'permission', 'read', 'Duchess', 'unpublished', 'letters', 'Wallis', 'really', 'loved', 'wanted', 'keep', 'second', 'husband', 'belief', 'Anne', 'Sebba', 'author', 'THAT', 'WOMAN', 'recent', 'Wallis', 'Windsor', 'biography', 'Wally', 'see', 'parallels', 'marriage', 'Wallis', 'disastrous', 'first', 'one.Madonna', 'director', 'writer', 'premarital', 'relationship', 'Edward', 'Wallis', 'was', 'chaste', 'Most', 'people', 'think', 'preposterous', 'what', 'Edward', 'claimed', 'Madonna', 'relationship', 'Wally', 'security', 'guard', 'chaste', 'too', 'as', 'long', 'marriage', 'really', 'are', 'errors', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'believing', 'are', 'deliberate', 'fake', 'newsreel', 'George', 'V', 'George', 'III', 'refers', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'having', 'been', 'crowned', 'Madonna', 'material', 'think', 'fine-tuned', 'labor', 'love', 'such', 'errors', 'are', 'meant', 'show', 'deafness', 'crudeness', 'press.Most', 'know', 'something', 'Edward/Wallis', 'story', 'too', 'many', 'know', 'too', 'little', 'Therefore', 'should', 'be', 'less', 'astounded', 'am', 'critics', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'literally', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'auteur', 'trying', 'say', 'symmetrical', 'work', 'art', 'definite', 'point', 'view', 'Madonna', 'not', 'HAVE', 'be', 'right', 'facts', 'indeed', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'guessed', 'interpretation', 'historical', 'novelist.I', 'have', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'doing', 'justice', 'strands', 'lovely', 'cobweb', 'movie']",W.E.

1451725,AEL6AD2AL2UX8,B0059XTV4Y,"Kevin ""Revolution""","[2, 2]","W.E. is the story of socialite Wallis Simpson who possessed Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor enough that it prompted him to give up the throne of England to marry this woman.  This move caused quite a stir at the time for various reasons.  One of them was that Wallis left her second husband for him and she was an American.  She and this guy were celebrities, both immensely loved, vilified and ostracized by society all at the same time.  Who better to tell that story than someone like Madonna who is one of those rare people who has lived a life that most of the world will never have or experience.The movie paints a portrait of this love affair that took place juxtaposed with another story in modern day time revolving around another woman, Wally Winthrop.  Wally is a fictional character who is an abusive relationship and fixates on this love story between Wallis and the Prince.  She fantasizes and obsesses over it to the point of hanging out in a museum that is dedicated to the historical artifacts of Wallis Simpson.  The subplot could've stood on its own in another film, but not this one.  The way the movie jumps from the subplot to the affair between the Prince and Wallis is disjointed and confusing.  It also stalls the momentum.  The same was done in the Meryl Streep film, Julie & Julia.  Focus on the main public figure and avoid creating a fictitious subplot as it rarely works.W.E. does have a nice sleepy art-house feel to it and it will probably be more popular with Europeans who seems to have an appreciation for this genre.  I can't see very many Americans liking this film and then you have those who will simply ban, knock and criticize this movie after discovering Madonna is the Director.  You would never have guessed it watching this as it was pretty good.The movie is watchable and the attention to detail with the sets, costume design and actors is top notch.

1451726,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0059XTV4Y,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[12, 13]","After seeing Madonna's love letter to controversial Wallis Simpson ""W.E"" get savaged by the mainstream media, I was somewhat apprehensive about the film. The love affair between Simpson and King Edward VIII is a stunning and momentous true-life story that resulted in him abdicating the crown and becoming a lifelong exile from the country he had served. It is unparalleled in terms of historical significance. What a fantastic subject! I knew that Madonna had a particular interest in Simpson's side of the story, so this seemed a novel approach to a somewhat familiar tale. From advance previews, it seemed that the film was positioned to be a sweeping romance so I didn't really expect a by-the-numbers historical biography. And in truth, I learned little new about the pair that I hadn't seen in countless other representations. But even taken on its own terms, I don't know that ""W.E."" really accomplishes what it set out to do. It's not all bad, by any stretch, but the movie keeps the viewer at arm's length throughout.In a strange decision, Madonna and her co-writer Alek Keshishian filter the famous love story through the eyes of a modern woman (Abbie Cornish). Cornish plays a rather expressionless upscale housewife tortured by an extravagant lifestyle and an inattentive husband. Just to elicit some sympathy for her plight of complete freedom and wealth, her husband is made out to be a cackling caricature of evil. Cornish is obsessively fixated on Wallis Simpson in a very creepy way (Simpson stories play non-stop on the radio and TV, she spends every waking moment studying memorabilia from the time period, and she has imaginary conversations with her idol). Of course, this aloof and troubled married woman is like catnip to a museum security officer (Oscar Isaac) and we all know where that is headed. In a fugue state, we see flashbacks to the courtship between Simpson and the King. Luckily, the scenes from the past are certainly more compelling than the contemporary plot thread which did not elicit my interest at all.Andrea Riseborough and James D'Arcy are actually quite good in the titular roles and any opportunity to escape into their world is a welcome one. However, if you want solid history, this isn't going to provide it. It's a bare bones examination of the political climate, the other members of the monarchy, or anything of substance. The more controversial aspects of the pair are mentioned, but dismissed as sheer rumor without any introspection. Okay, fine, than hopefully this is a stunning romance. Well, not really. I never felt the real chemistry between these two. In fact, Simpson (especially in their courtship) seems to be manipulating the relationship from the start. I'm willing to believe this was a tremendous love story in real life, but this screenplay never convinces me in the film. And when we're supposed to view Simpson with great empathy at what she's sacrificed, her supposed misery and suffering just hasn't been well established.And yet, for its faults, I must admit that this is one gorgeous movie! The shot compositions are interesting, the sets are extravagant, the Oscar nominated costumes are lovely, the orchestrations are lush and beautiful. Technically, ""W.E."" is extremely impressive. The film's shortcomings have little to do with the actors. If half of the movie hadn't been spent in modern times, this might well have been an entirely more satisfying experience.

She's obsessed with the story of Wallis Simpson and Edward VII  (called ""W.E."") and wonders what it was like to be so loved that a man would give up his crown for you.  The movie jumps between the lives of the two Wallises following the royal romance and the end of Wally's marriage.Visually, there's a lot to like:  The sets are elaborate, the costumes elegant, and the 30s period is reproduced in lovely detail.  The movie falls flat, however, for several reasons:  The story jumps so quickly and randomly between the past and present that it's chaotic (and too much like ""Julie and Julia"") and there's no real connection between the two stories.  None of the leading characters is likable, the royals being spoiled and self-centered and the NYC folks being relentlessly dreary.  No new insights are given to the famous W.E. union and neither the royal story nor the modern story is developed in depth.

I watched it after ""Young Adult""(very good) and ""Chronicle"" (stupid) and of course it was free to me.  I was glad I did not pay to watch.  I have to admit that from a visual point of view the part of the movie that revolves around Wallis and Edward, rather than Wallie and whatever her husband's name was, is visually stunning (particularly the costumes, makeup, hair).  The contemporary part is flat and monochromatic and frankly all I could think of through most of it was ""Snap out of it and leave him for Pete's sake!""  That was a marriage that was beyond dysfunctional.  I suppose Madonna was trying to send some message about smart women who nonetheless find themselves in controlling relationships, but it fell flat with me.  As for any historical interest in the Wallis and Edward part, you can forget about it - it is highly superficial (providing only a platform for the previously mentioned costumes, makeup, hair) and there were certain aspects that really bothered me (eg the height difference between the actors playing Wallis and Edward - in real life the difference was not that great and in the movie he towers over her).  As to whether the couple were fascist sympathizers or simply freeloaders who went wherever room, board and glamor beckoned is something I frankly don't care about - they certainly had poor judgment about where they went and who they were photographed with.The real standout in this movie and what made it absolutely worth watching was the romantic soundtrack by Abel Korzeniowski.

Edward VIII gave up a throne he never really wanted, but this film asks us to consider what Wallis Simpson surrendered.  Most histories see her as having gained advantage by her position, this film suggests otherwise, and rightly so. As for Wallis and Edward, watching him ask her to dance for his amusement, even in old age, says it all.I had heard some of the negatives, but wanted to see Madonna's interpretation, and I found the film quietly effective. I'm not a Maddona fan, but as a director she was foreign territory.  She did well, intertwining the two stories, the overlay of emotions and the gentle stripping away of a veneer that's been so frequently painted over the story.  I followed the modern narrative with more interest than expected, and overall found the film very satisfying. The attitudes of George V and his wife are speculation, (they're portrayed as weak and shrewish) as the film overlooks how much they were forced to sacrifice when Edward VIII abdicated.  After all, the stress and pressure of the throne were serious factors in George V's early demise.Perhaps Madonna is saying something about her own misery with fame (albeit, self inflicted) perhaps not, but forget she's there and enjoy the film.

Granted she's only directed two but without the celebrity status she brings to a picture why would anyone hire her to direct when so many good directors are looking for their next project?W.E. is the story of Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee, and Edward, the next King of England, and their romance. Well for most the story would be about that. Instead Madonna puts a new twist on the story that's been told time and time again. And of course that twist is more lurid than most films choose to use.But rather than just stick with the one story we have another running first and alongside the famous romance. A young woman is trouble with her marriage to her husband and keeps coming back to an auction house selling off pieces of Simpson's past. What a great way to go back and forth in time and allow for some glimpses of newer lingerie.Its been said that the point of this film was less about presenting an historically accurate telling of the same tale once more but more about discussing celebrity and people's desire to have that notoriety. In the way this story is told that seems to be the only thing that interests Wallis Simpson. In an unhappy marriage (on her part at least) she seeks fame and attention. She wants the hoi paloi to take notice of her, to talk about her parties and her friendships. Edward comes off as little more than a party boy who goes from one woman to the next. I could be wrong but I think there was more to their story than that and using them to tell a story completely foreign to their real lives seems a bit much.  Rather than do so why not just use a fictional couple instead? Using historical figures involves viewers bringing with them the baggage of knowing what they know about them already. To try and present them as something else just causes confusion.But that's not the worst of it. The worst of it is that the film is completely boring. There are no characters to sympathize with, to care about or to feel involved with. Everyone is self serving and watching them prance about from one party to another is just tedious.One thing will result from this movie. Those who are die hard fans of Madonna will rise to the occasion and defend it as a work of art. They will attack anyone who dares try to say different. Fortunately this is a minority from the look of the box office results for this film as well as DVD sales.

E. is a handsome film, co-written and directed by Madonna, which deals with the scandalous romance between Edward, the Duke of Windsor, and his American Duchess, twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.Like JULIE & JULIA, the picture tells two parallel stories.  One deals with Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) an unhappily married woman during the 1990swho is totally obsessed with Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough), and even imagines having conversations with her.  Indeed, in one of these fantasy moments, Simpson turns to Wally and snaps, ""Get a life!""  The other story follows the path of Edward (James D'Arcy) and the woman who caused him to abdicate the throne of England.The actors are excellent, as is Madonna's direction.  The problem with this film is that the modern story, which dominates, is really not as intriguing as the historical one, even though we know how that one will turn out.  Unfortunately, it's apparent from the start how the fictional Wally Winthrop's saga is going to end also.The movie does, however, make some interesting points about the difference between the legendary ""fairy tale"" romance and reality.Oscar Isaac, Natalie Dormer, Richard Coyle and James Fox co-star in the film, released in a 3-disc (DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital) set by Anchor Bay Entertainment.

Simpson (an excellent Andrea Riseborough, ""Never Let Me Go"") was the married American who King Edward (The ""E."") gave up the British throne for.  This film deals with their trials and tribulations but primarily from the perspective of Simpson.  We see this played out in numerous time jumps between the 1930's and the late 1990's as another Wally (Abbie Cornish, ""Limitless"") envisions the pair 6 decades earlier.Wally has just married a successful clinical psychiatrist, but the marriage isn't going well.  She wants a child; her husband appears to want to just fool around on the side.  An auction at Sotheby's provides additional interest for Wally (named after Ms. Simpson) as many of the royal couple's personal belongings are being auctioned off.  There she meets one of the firm's security personnel played by Oscar Isaac (""Drive"").  This meeting will have consequences down the line.I believe this is Madonna's first time as a director of a feature film and I do think she has promise.  She also co-wrote this film which is the biggest problem.  At times the movie plays like a Zalman King soft porn film but without the soft porn.  The soundtrack, while pretty, puts the scenes to sleep on occasion not to mention the audience.  But there are also some nice bits, mostly with Ms. Riseborough.  In one scene, she dances with a black woman at a party in France.  While not risqu&eacute;, it was attention getting.  In another dance sequence she does Chubby Checker's ""The Twist"" for her dying husband in 1972.The film has a nice look to it, both in the modern and flashback sequences.  This isn't a great movie, but isn't terrible either.  It would have likely gotten better press if not for Madonna's name being attached.There is certainly nothing to complain about with the 1080p Blu ray transfer.

Wally Winthrop is an upper class wife of a blue blooded psychiatrist in Manhattan who feels trapped in her loveless and abusive marriage in 1998.  She was named after Wallis Simpson whose scandalous romance with the future King of England Edward VIII rocked 1930's England when he decided to give up the throne for the love of this woman and to marry her. Wally becomes obsessed with the story of Wallis and Edward (W.E.) when their belongings are auctioned at Sotheby's.  The two stories transition back and forth between the two Wallys and one of the main questions in the story is what defines true love and what does one have to sacrifice for true love if it's found?  Why would King Edward give up being king and an entire country for a woman?  What did Wallis Simpson give up to be with the king and spent the rest of her life hated by the press and ostracized by so many?

1451745,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B0059XTV4Y,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[4, 4]","This year seems to be the year of Wallis Simpson.  For some reason, there were many books nad movies made about the American woman who was twice divorced and yet managed to marry British King.  He had to abdicate his throne in order ""to be with the woman he loves"" and he did so probably without fully realizing the consequences of such decision.  Historians consider Edward as a kind of royal that would make an inadequate king: he liked to party, he was always surrounded by women and he had uncanny affinity towards Germans, that in late 1930s made many nervous.Wallis on the other hand, was from humble background.  Growing up,she always depended on her rich cousins and her goal in life was to marry good, financially stable and reliable husband.  Her first marriage was tragic, because her husband, a professional soldier, turned out to be a drunk.  Her second husband who had business interest in England was boring yet well of and reliable.  It is through his social circles that she met british royalty.This movie gives parallel stories of Wallis and Edward's affair compared to the modern day couple: a successful NYC doctor and his young and beautiful stay at home wife who incidentally bears the name Wallis.  Modern day Wallis is fascinated with the other Wallis woman and she ha romantic view of the relationship that many labled as the ""biggest romance of the century"".  Isolated, lonely and largely ignored by her husband she finds solace in researching the life and love of Wallis and Edward.  In her pursuit to learn more, she goes to the Sotheby's auction of Wallis Simpson's personal possessions.Madonna directed this film and seems to have tried to make it an art film.  But other than realy nice costumes and make up I found movie disappointing.  There is no depth in any of the characters.

1451747,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0059XTV4Y,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[3, 3]","Coming out at around the same time asThe King's Speechand purporting to explore the love affair between King Edward VIII  and twice-divorced American woman Wallis Simpson (the catalyst for the events of the aforementioned ""King's Speech"") this Madonna directed film is certainly big on style yet sadly low on substance.The problem is that the story of Wallis and Edward is told through the irrelevant framing device of a contemporary woman desperate to get pregnant with a husband who grows steadily more abusive as the film goes on. It's hard understand why we should care about any of this when the focus should obviously be on the couple that the film is named after.Wally Winthrop has two things in her life: an unhappy marriage and a strange obsession with Wallis Simpson. The latter leads her to do a number of vaguely creepy things such as dressing like Wallis, haunting the Wallis and Edward exhibition at the auction house, spending thousands of dollars on a pair of gloves that belonged to Wallis, lying her way into a meeting with Mohammed al Fayed in order to read Wallis's letters (how is this even POSSIBLE?) and carrying on a number of conversations with Wallis which I can only assume are meant to be elaborate delusions.Whilst all this is going on she kindles a romance with an employee at the auction house who is described by another character as (I kid you not) ""a Russian intellectual slumming as a security guard"". He's handsome and charming and mysterious and sensitive. He makes an offhand comment early on that Wally reminds him of his wife, and sure enough, we learn later that he's not a divorcee but a lonely widower whose Bohemian apartment is filled with literature and art. Honestly, he's as much a fantasy as Wally's hallucinations of Wallis are.When one gets hold of a movie called ""W.E."", one doesn't expect it to be about a rather strange woman's attempt to gain control of her own life by daydreaming about another woman. I think Madonna (co-writer/director) *may* have been trying to make a statement about how ordinary people can become too swept up in the love stories of celebrities, often forgetting to live their own lives in the meanwhile. Hey, if anyone could give us an insightful look on that theme it's Madonna, but what we get is the story of a woman living a life of wealth and luxury with an obsessive interest in Wallis Simpson and a sleazebag for a husband. Wait, wasn't this released at about the same time as Madonna's divorce? The whole thing comes across as an elaborate fan-fiction starring Abbie Cornish as Madonna's self-insert OC, making herself the focus of a film that's technically meant to be about Wallis and Edward.It's with them that the interest truly lies, and it's a darn shame that they're so short-changed. Andrea Riseborough is beguiling as Wallis, capturing the woman's speech patterns and mannerisms, and James D'Arcy manages to portray Edward as utterly besotted without rendering him emasculated. Madonna also ensembles a wonderful supporting cast for the period half of the film: Natalie Dormer, Katie McGrath, James Fox, Laurence Fox and Judy Parfitt, but they only get a couple of scenes each before the story reverts back to Wally and her comparatively banal unhappiness.Things like the courtship and secret love affair between Edward and Wallis are glossed over and there are simply too many gaps in their love story for it to have any resonance. Having watched the film, I gained no real understanding as to why Edward chose to give up his throne for Wallis. They meet, they flirt, and suddenly Edward is declaring his intense passion for her. Likewise, I never got a sense of the affair's historical impact or how scandalous it was at the time. Edward's reading of his abdication speech plays out with a lot of emotion, but it exists in a void. There's no sense of how it affects the country or the royal family on a larger scale. It just sort of happens.The film also raises some questions concerning the happiness of the marriage and the couple's association with Hitler, but doesn't even try to offer any answers. Every time it begins to reveal some insight into how exactly Wallis felt about the constitutional crisis that she (partially) caused, we're treated to another twenty minutes of Abbie Cornish's curiously expressionless face.But regardless of its problems, this is an exceptionally beautiful film to look at. Lavish attention is given to costumes, props, music, hair, makeup and other technical aspects, rendering this a feast for the eyes and ears. There are endless montages of the rich and famous dancing, feasting, socializing and enjoying themselves - and let's be honest, we all secretly love watching that sort of thing, even if it's just to complain about it. If you can focus solely on the period scenes it works well as a companion piece to ""The King's Speech""; in fact in some cases it's better. Andrea Riseborough completely embodies Wallis Simpson, and although Colin Firth walked away with the Oscar for his portrayal of Albert, I think Lawrence Fox bore a greater resemblance to the man.It's a strange little movie really, and probably appealing only to those interested in the subject matter. Whereas ""The King's Speech"" was accessible even to those who didn't know a thing about the history and figures involved, ""W.E."" requires at least partial awareness of the historical context. Try and enjoy its visual flair and keep the remote handy for fast-forwarding the irrelevant stuff.",3,"""He Used Me to Escape his Own Prison Only to Incarcerate Me in My Own...""",1370390400,"06 5,

She lifted so much from those sources it was a little embarrassing to watch.  Then to top it all off she uses the formula from the film ""The Hours"", where the viewer was forced to jump back and forth between the life of Virginia Wolf and other women without rhyme or reason.  Madonna has some fascination with filming domestic violence since she insinuates that Wallis was somehow bashed around by her husband and so couldn't have children when all accounts of her first two marriages were that she was treated very very well...but social climbers will do as they do. This film is beautifully filmed but unfortunately doesn't have anything poignant to say about anything in particular, the story line is trite, she adds no new insight nor even a new vision or perspective on Wallis and Edward.  She rudely portrays the Queens mother and father in the worst light when they were known to be very low key family whom had the thrown pushed on them.

1451759,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B0059XTV4Y,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[10, 19]","The story of Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII is a fascinating one. Even as they passed through The King's Speech in a supporting storyline(played then by Guy Pearce and Eve Best), the idea of a monarch giving up his throne to be with his multi-divorced, American socialite lover is the stuff storybook romances are made of. Madonna, who co-wrote the script and makes her first feature directorial effort since 2008's Filth and Wisdom(which nobody saw and for good reason), clearly sees something of herself in Wallis, a woman who to the very lenient was an innocent bystander as the American paparazzi skewered her on a regular basis. More critical eyes will note Wallis' guile and opportunistic nature in all things, but most obviously in how she used her charms to woo her way into the upper echelons of society, even if it meant thrusting England into a constitutional crisis at a time when it could least afford it. The various interpretations of Simpson and Edward's scandalous affair is part of what makes them so intriguing, but Madonna has no interest in exploring any of that, content only with the thinnest representation as possible.Yet, Madonna's decision to present such an idealized view of Wallis(Andrea Riseborough) and Edward(James D'arcy), the future King of England, would have been tolerable if not for the questionable way in which she chooses to tell it. Divided into two separate but connecting stories, one set in 1998 and following poor Wally Winthrop(Abbie Cornish), the beleaguered wife of an arrogant but highly successful doctor. Essentially a trophy wife, Wally endures his emotional and physical abuse, even as she struggles to get pregnant through a series of fertility injections. Finding an emotional void in her life, Wally becomes obsessed with the story of Wallis and Edward, which she sees as the perfect fairy tale romance. Unable to resist hovering around a collection of their personal belongings up for auction, she looks for answers to her own problems by looking at their pasts, and in the process maybe finds new love with a surprisingly astute security guard(Oscar Isaac).Slipping back and forth through time to draw some rather slim parallels between the two women, it becomes increasingly less clear why Madonna split the narrative this way when clearly her interests lie in the past. The best way to explain it is that she had an overabundance of artistic energy and no idea how to harness it, as some of her flourishes make no sense. Sometimes it's hard to tell if she's shooting a biopic or a bad commercial for blue jeans or perfume. The confusion is amplified by an oddly selected soundtrack, especially when a drug fueled party thrown by Wallis and Edward roars to life accompanied by the Sex Pistols.Even if some of the creative choices are bizarre, at least the historical segments have some flair to them. The present day scenes are a crashing bore and shot in as flat a tone as possible. Abbie Cornish, usually such a firecracker on screen, is helpless against the bland cinematography and silly, melodramatic script. There has scarcely been a love more dull than that of Wally and her all too perfect Russian guard who comes off a little stalkerish as he watches her anxiously through the security cameras.Wallis was treated pretty shabbily in The King's Speech, but Andrea Riseborough tries to give her a touch more depth despite not having much to work with on the writing front. We see Wallis' intensity and devotion to the man she loves, even as she knows she'll be forever hated for taking the King away from his people. D'arcy is forgettable as Edward, especially when compared to Guy Pearce's previous charismatic turn. It's really unfortunate that this film had to come out in the wake of the 2010 Best Picture winner, because it's impossible not to compare, and when done so W.E. is found to be severely lacking.",2,An amazing story gone to waste,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,3884,"['story', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'fascinating', 'one', 'Even', 'passed', 'King', 'Speech', 'supporting', 'storyline', 'played', 'then', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Eve', 'Best', 'idea', 'monarch', 'giving', 'up', 'throne', 'be', 'multi-divorced', 'American', 'socialite', 'lover', 'stuff', 'storybook', 'romances', 'are', 'made', 'Madonna', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'first', 'feature', 'directorial', 'effort', '2008', 'Filth', 'Wisdom', 'nobody', 'saw', 'good', 'reason', 'clearly', 'something', 'herself', 'Wallis', 'woman', 'who', 'very', 'lenient', 'was', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'American', 'paparazzi', 'skewered', 'regular', 'basis', 'More', 'critical', 'eyes', 'will', 'note', 'Wallis', 'guile', 'opportunistic', 'nature', 'things', 'most', 'obviously', 'how', 'used', 'charms', 'woo', 'way', 'upper', 'echelons', 'society', 'even', 'meant', 'thrusting', 'England', 'constitutional', 'crisis', 'time', 'when', 'could', 'least', 'afford', 'various', 'interpretations', 'Simpson', 'Edward', 'scandalous', 'affair', 'part', 'what', 'so', 'intriguing', 'Madonna', 'interest', 'exploring', 'content', 'only', 'thinnest', 'representation', 'possible.Yet', 'Madonna', 'decision', 'present', 'such', 'idealized', 'view', 'Wallis', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'Edward', 'James', ""D'arcy"", 'future', 'King', 'England', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tolerable', 'not', 'questionable', 'way', 'tell', 'Divided', 'two', 'separate', 'connecting', 'stories', 'one', 'set', '1998', 'following', 'poor', 'Wally', 'Winthrop', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'beleaguered', 'wife', 'arrogant', 'highly', 'successful', 'doctor', 'Essentially', 'trophy', 'wife', 'Wally', 'emotional', 'physical', 'abuse', 'even', 'get', 'pregnant', 'series', 'fertility', 'injections', 'Finding', 'emotional', 'void', 'life', 'Wally', 'obsessed', 'story', 'Wallis', 'Edward', 'perfect', 'fairy', 'tale', 'romance', 'Unable', 'resist', 'hovering', 'collection', 'personal', 'belongings', 'up', 'auction', 'answers', 'own', 'problems', 'looking', 'pasts', 'process', 'maybe', 'new', 'love', 'surprisingly', 'astute', 'security', 'guard', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', '.Slipping', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'draw', 'rather', 'slim', 'parallels', 'two', 'women', 'increasingly', 'less', 'clear', 'why', 'Madonna', 'split', 'narrative', 'way', 'when', 'clearly', 'interests', 'lie', 'past', 'best', 'way', 'explain', 'had', 'overabundance', 'artistic', 'energy', 'idea', 'how', 'harness', 'flourishes', 'make', 'sense', 'hard', 'tell', 'shooting', 'biopic', 'bad', 'commercial', 'blue', 'jeans', 'perfume', 'confusion', 'amplified', 'oddly', 'selected', 'soundtrack', 'especially', 'when', 'drug', 'fueled', 'party', 'thrown', 'Wallis', 'Edward', 'life', 'accompanied', 'Sex', 'Pistols.Even', 'creative', 'choices', 'are', 'bizarre', 'least', 'historical', 'segments', 'have', 'flair', 'present', 'day', 'scenes', 'are', 'crashing', 'bore', 'shot', 'flat', 'tone', 'possible', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'usually', 'such', 'firecracker', 'screen', 'helpless', 'bland', 'cinematography', 'silly', 'melodramatic', 'script', 'scarcely', 'been', 'love', 'more', 'dull', 'Wally', 'too', 'perfect', 'Russian', 'guard', 'who', 'off', 'little', 'stalkerish', 'anxiously', 'security', 'cameras.Wallis', 'was', 'treated', 'pretty', 'shabbily', 'King', 'Speech', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'tries', 'give', 'touch', 'more', 'depth', 'not', 'having', 'much', 'work', 'writing', 'front', 'see', 'Wallis', 'intensity', 'devotion', 'man', 'even', ""'ll"", 'be', 'forever', 'hated', 'taking', 'King', 'away', 'people', ""D'arcy"", 'forgettable', 'Edward', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'previous', 'charismatic', 'turn', 'really', 'unfortunate', 'film', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'wake', '2010', 'Best', 'Picture', 'winner', 'impossible', 'not', 'compare', 'when', 'done', 'so', 'W.E', 'found', 'be', 'severely', 'lacking']",W.E.

W.E. is one of the worst films I've ever seen-it was murky and lame.Madonna spent almost USD$40 million (or $20 million British pounds) to make essentially a love letter to a bunch of royals and fashion victims with' Nazi sympathies and in some cases PROVEN COLLABORATIONS which she claims are ""libel""(sic).

1451761,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0059XTV4Y,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 3]","Following her ""Filth and Wisdom"" (2008), Madonna directs a film, this time about a life of ""W.E."" - Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII. (Actually there is another ""W.E."" but about that, later). The story of ""the romance of the century"" is so famous that I don't think I have to repeat it here. Wallis Simpson is played by Andrea Riseborough; King Edward VIII is by James D'Arcy.Somehow Madonna (who also co-wrote the script with Alek Keshishian, director of ""With Honors,"" ""Love and Other Disasters"" and a documentary ""Madonna: Truth or Dare"") thought that the subject matter needs an unconventional narrative style. As a result, about half of the film is spent on the story of another W.E. living in 1998, New York: two fictional characters Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish), wife of a successful psychiatrist, and Evgeni (Oscar Isaac), Russian security guard working for Sotheby's. Neglected and mistreated by her husband, Wally is obsessed with Wallis Simpson.Though panned by critics, ""W.E."" is not that bad. Actors all deliver fine performances. Period costumes are beautiful (the film is Oscar nominated for the costume designer Arianne Phillips' brilliant work). The dynamic musical score of Abel Korzeniowski is impressive. Some of the songs Madonna chooses (including The Sex Pistols and Chubby Checker) are used in an unpredictable way.But the film as a whole is a mess. ""W.E."" is ambitious, maybe too ambitious. The film struggles to fit two stories separated by sixty years into one narrative, but the result is not good. The editing is too busy and confusing; character of Wally is hard to connect with; camerawork (including too many close-ups) is hectic and intrusive, detracting from the story of the real W.E. we really want to know. Clearly there are so many good ingredients here, but somehow the film is overcooked.",2,Not That Bad  Actually: Had It Focused on One W.E.
