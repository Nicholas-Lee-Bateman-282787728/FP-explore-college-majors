(I would DEFINITELY agree on the nickname Drop Dead Fred gave the mom in the flick; and its funny seeing it now for a few reasons....(although my fiance had to get us a different copy cause this one was British....but THAT'S Not what this reviews about.) I saw the trailer to this when I was a kid (and I wanted to see this because back then I'd been watching The Young Ones......Living with The Young Ones ( and Drop Dead Fred was always my Favorite from the show (which my British Friend Jon....thought was REALLY cool; cause big surprise....he loves the show 2! ) And I saw it So many times growing up I lost count.....then I watched it again on TV .....in around 2003......and I got more of the Plotline. I still REALLY hated that mother, and Carrie Fischer....( Because they're trying to put Pheobe Cates (in the Only movie I do like her in) into They're perception of how she should live....AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT! That's just not how it works; if you're kids an Outcast, you Should be happy; because that means your SOMEONE interesting....someone better, not just some snobby cardboard cut-out. Now I had known that for years.....so how come I didn't get that in the movie? Well I liked her as Drop Dead Fred's love SO much, that I hadn't gotten that she was supposed to be with her friend she had met years later (her friend from when she was a kid. Now I did like Pheobe Cates dad, and agreed with him fully when he didn't agree with the mom taking Drop Dead Fred away....just because she thought it would make her daughter more like her.....again THAT ticks me off! And speaking of.....Carrie Fischer You are NOT acting sane by causing that scene......You're the one who's acting like a nut. But that doesn't mean I don't like the film.....(No no....I think the point was made VERY well, and with a lot of people they just didn't understand the ending.......but I'm NOT done yet....No no.....cause I haven't talked about the ending yet, SO here we go!) I wanna be free....but I need some help, I need a friend to come with me......but sometimes even when you know what you want......and you know your friend can help you......they can't do it themselves......So in My version when I open the door....and see A Head Cheerleader from High school, who I KNOW stands for teenage popularity.....I yell &#34;I DON'T HAVE TO BE LIKE YOU! And the door will slam closed. Walking over to my bed to an 8 year old version of myself with red tape on my blanket.....I notice there's a framed picture of Corey Feldman on my nightstand. I smile at the 8 year old version of me and undo the tape. &#34;Don't worry, you can live happily ever after.&#34; I say and when I wake up from my dream I go outside and see a girl who's 8 years old. &#34;Hey! I said a large smile on my face......figuring Drop Dead Fred would help another Outcast girl be an original.....and don't worry , you'll all get to hear the rest of this story later......and remember....Believe in yourself!",5,It Brings Your Childhood Back,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,3103,"['Hey', 'Sunnydale', 'Chick', 'here', '..I', 'Always', 'had', 'mom', 'rent', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'MUCH', 'nicer', 'then', 'one', 'movie', 'would', 'DEFINITELY', 'agree', 'nickname', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Fred', 'gave', 'mom', 'flick', 'funny', 'seeing', 'now', 'few', 'reasons', 'fiance', 'had', 'get', 'different', 'copy', 'cause', 'one', 'was', 'British', '.but', 'Not', 'what', 'about', 'saw', 'trailer', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'wanted', 'see', 'back', 'then', ""'d"", 'been', 'watching', 'Young', 'Ones', 'Living', 'Young', 'Ones', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Fred', 'was', 'always', 'Favorite', 'show', 'British', 'Friend', 'Jon', '.thought', 'was', 'REALLY', 'cool', 'cause', 'big', 'surprise', 'show', '2', 'saw', 'So', 'many', 'times', 'growing', 'up', 'lost', 'count', '..then', 'watched', 'again', 'TV', '2003', 'got', 'more', 'Plotline', 'still', 'REALLY', 'hated', 'mother', 'Carrie', 'Fischer', ""'re"", 'trying', 'put', 'Pheobe', 'Cates', 'Only', 'movie', 'do', ""'re"", 'perception', 'how', 'should', 'live', '.AND', 'YOU', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'DO', 'THAT', 'just', 'not', 'how', ""'re"", 'kids', 'Outcast', 'Should', 'be', 'happy', 'SOMEONE', 'interesting', '.someone', 'better', 'not', 'just', 'snobby', 'cardboard', 'cut-out', 'Now', 'had', 'known', 'years', 'how', 'come', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'Well', 'liked', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Fred', 'love', 'SO', 'much', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'friend', 'had', 'met', 'years', 'later', 'friend', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Now', 'did', 'like', 'Pheobe', 'Cates', 'dad', 'agreed', 'fully', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'mom', 'taking', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Fred', 'away', '.just', 'thought', 'would', 'make', 'daughter', 'more', '..again', 'off', 'speaking', '..Carrie', 'Fischer', 'are', 'NOT', 'acting', 'sane', 'causing', 'scene', ""'re"", 'one', 'who', 'acting', 'nut', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', '..', 'No', '.I', 'think', 'point', 'was', 'made', 'VERY', 'well', 'lot', 'people', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'ending', '.but', ""'m"", 'NOT', 'done', 'yet', '..cause', 'have', ""n't"", 'talked', 'ending', 'yet', 'SO', 'here', 'go', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'free', '.but', 'need', 'help', 'need', 'friend', 'come', 'sometimes', 'even', 'when', 'know', 'what', 'want', 'know', 'friend', 'can', 'help', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'So', 'My', 'version', 'when', 'open', 'door', '.and', 'see', 'Head', 'Cheerleader', 'High', 'school', 'who', 'KNOW', 'stands', 'teenage', 'popularity', '..I', 'yell', '34', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'HAVE', 'TO', 'BE', 'LIKE', 'YOU', 'door', 'will', 'slam', 'closed', 'Walking', 'bed', '8', 'year', 'old', 'version', 'red', 'tape', 'blanket', '..I', 'notice', 'framed', 'picture', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'nightstand', 'smile', '8', 'year', 'old', 'version', 'undo', 'tape', '34', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'can', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.', '34', 'say', 'when', 'wake', 'up', 'dream', 'go', 'outside', 'see', 'girl', 'who', '8', 'years', 'old', '34', 'Hey', 'said', 'large', 'smile', 'face', 'figuring', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Fred', 'would', 'help', 'Outcast', 'girl', 'be', 'original', '..and', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'ll"", 'get', 'hear', 'rest', 'story', 'later', 'remember']",N/A

However at a certain age this becomes an absurd idea and therefore the friend must leave. The concept has been put forth in many movies such as ""The Curse of the Cat People"" (1944), and books such as ""Peter Pan"" or ""Mimsy Were the Borogroves"" by Henry Kuttner and C.L. Moor,which depicts a child's mindset as alien to those of humans.------------------------------------------------------------------------Elizabeth As a child (Ashley Peldon) had her share of problems as a friend and also had her own supposedly imaginary-friend ""Drop Dead Fred"" (Rik Mayall). Of whom she was supposed to outgrow. She had a little help from her mother who locked Fred away in a Jack-in-the-box.Now Elizabeth (Phoebe Cates) is once again having problems with a recent divorce along with many other disasters. She makes the strategic error of moving back home. She finds where Fred is confined and pretends to frees him; guess who she finds out is not imaginary and is still waiting as if time had not passed at all. This happens when one goes home again. Now Fred is appalled to find that Snot Face is all grown up and that she even did it like the pigeons. How ever Fred is just as mischievous, ornery, and destructive as ever.It is up to the two codependent entities to help free each other from a static situation; Liz needs to grow up and Fred needs to move on the next kid. In the process Elizabeth meats a girl Natalie Bunce (Kelly Benson), that seems to be annoying the babysitter. And she claims it was ""You know who"".-------------------------------------------------------------------------Will Elizabeth finally take control of her life and out grow the need for Fred?If so will she ever see him again?The movie is worth it on different levels or diffident angles. We have the fun of the interacting and antics of Fred, Elisabeth and boogers. There is a true underlying psychological story that includes a trip through ones mind.

302846,A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,6302229847,Bruce P. Barten,"[0, 5]","I enjoy watching this movie.  It is comic, with mildly romping music in the background for a few funny bits.  If you subtract the comedy, you are left with a cast of five major characters, plus two little girls, a few marriages breaking up, psychological problems for which the main character is supposed to take some green pills, and scenes shot in the Twin Cities, where the Mississippi River has some boats, one of which has two red paddlewheels.  Drop Dead Fred wants to play pirates on that boat, which is the biggest catastrophe in the movie.Except for the scene in the shrink's waiting room, only one character in this movie is playing a mother, but she dominates the early scenes.  It is amazing how well a few lines can capture the mother and daughter situation:I'm perfect the way that I am.Don't disagree with your mother.Now that we're home, everything is perfect.As crazy as some of the situations get, things resolve reasonably well for the daughter.  Drop Dead Fred has been locked up in a toy since the main character was a little girl, and Fred is not prepared for the sexual approach when her husband suddenly wants to make up, make out, or something.  As he says, This isn't how the pigeons do it.During a *what a lovely dress* conversation, Drop Dead Fred even feels like he is with two girls.  The guys in this movie seem more clueless than usual, and they don't get much respect in lines like:What are you doing?I'm running for Congress!  What does it look like I'm doing?The cartoon credits at the beginning of the movie has some cute moves.  A fisherman in a boat during the credit for casting might even remind some people of Minnesota.  The Director of Photography credit should remind people of making sausage.  The special effects whenever someone sneezes because of the gladiolas in a few scenes are funny enough to remember after you see them a few times.  Even though they named this movie for Drop Dead Fred, he could easily be considered the worst part of the film.

302858,A6A38ESR48ZPK,6302229847,"grundle2600 ""grundle2600""","[26, 30]","On the surface, &quot;Drop Dead Fred&quot; is a comedy. And as a comedy, it's a great one. Rik Mayall, of course, if very funny. Phoebe Cates displays a genuine talent for physical comedy in several scenes - at the restaurant, at the classical music concert, and at the wine tasting party. And I just LOVE the scream that Cates lets out when Fred scares her while she's standing in front of the mirror wiping the makeup off of her face. Carrie Fisher is also very funny as a super-rigid super-serious lawyer.However, at it's heart, this movie is a drama with some very serious issues and some very serious messages. Ultimately, this movie is about standing up for yourself. It's about taking control of your life. It's about standing up to defend yourself from the people who are tormenting you. Anyone who's ever been bullied stands to benefit from seeing this film. It really is a good form of therapy. You'll know that you're not alone. You'll know that there are other people who know how you feel. And that's one of the reaons why I love this movie so much.Of course another reaosn I love this movie is Phoebe Cates. Her characer here is so sweet and wonderful. How can any guy see this movie and not think he's in love with her? And honestly, I think she's a better actress when she keeps her clothes on, as she does here. Throughout the course of the movie, Cates displays just about every emotion that there is. She's truly a great actress.Kudos also go to Ashley Peldon, who does a remarkable job as the child version of Elizabeth. Tim Matheson does a perfect job portraying the jerk husband. Marsha Mason is fantastic as the evil mother. All the other actors do their jobs very well. Every role is cast perfectly.Every scene in the movie is necessary. Nothing is wasted. Every line of dialogue counts. The flashbacks to childdhood are integrated perfectly into the rest of the movie.There are some interesting camera angles here that I've never seen before. For example, in the flashback to where the mudpie gets made in the dining room, young Elizabeth is sitting on the chair, shaky and scared because her mother had just yelled at her. While the camera is focused on her, the camera pans 90 degrees, and then her face lights up with a smile and she says, &quot;Hi Fred!&quot; I've never seen that particular kind of camera shot before. I also like the way, later on when grown up Elizabeth is making the salad, the camera is *under* the pepper grinder. And during the end of the dream sequence towards the end of the movie, the various lighting and camera angles suggest a play that is being performed live on a stage.The low budget cheesy special effects give a nice, old fashioned touch to the film. For example, the cheap physical effects of gears and other things that are shown when Velcro Head's head explodes simply would not have had the same charm if it had been done in expensive CGI.The movie is timeless. The only real clue to when the movie takes place is that in the flashback to the breakfast scene, young Elizabeth's father is reading a newspaper with the heading about the first man on the moon.The best part of the movie, in my opinion, is the dream sequence, and everything that comes afterwards. The last 25 minutes of this movie are what really elevate it to what it is. This is the part that really moves me the most. Of course, in order to understand it, you need to see the entire movie. And that's a good thing, because the entire movie is worth watching.This is a movie for anyone who remembers what it's like to be a child, and for anyone who has a sense of fun and a love of life, and for anyone who's ever been hurt because of bullying. This movie has a big heart, a big sense of fun, a big sense of humor, and a big love of life.",5,"At its heart, this is a movie about self empowerment.",1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,3772,"['surface', 'quot', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Fred', 'quot', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'great', 'one', 'Rik', 'Mayall', 'course', 'very', 'funny', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'genuine', 'talent', 'physical', 'comedy', 'several', 'scenes', 'restaurant', 'classical', 'music', 'concert', 'wine', 'tasting', 'party', 'just', 'LOVE', 'scream', 'out', 'when', 'Fred', 'standing', 'front', 'mirror', 'wiping', 'makeup', 'face', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'super-rigid', 'super-serious', 'lawyer.However', 'heart', 'movie', 'drama', 'very', 'serious', 'issues', 'very', 'serious', 'messages', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'standing', 'up', 'taking', 'control', 'life', 'standing', 'up', 'defend', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'tormenting', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'bullied', 'stands', 'benefit', 'seeing', 'film', 'really', 'good', 'form', 'therapy', ""'ll"", 'know', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone', ""'ll"", 'know', 'are', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'feel', 'one', 'reaons', 'why', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'much.Of', 'course', 'reaosn', 'love', 'movie', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'characer', 'here', 'so', 'sweet', 'wonderful', 'How', 'can', 'guy', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'think', 'love', 'honestly', 'think', 'better', 'actress', 'when', 'clothes', 'here', 'course', 'movie', 'Cates', 'just', 'about', 'emotion', 'truly', 'great', 'actress.Kudos', 'also', 'go', 'Ashley', 'Peldon', 'who', 'remarkable', 'job', 'child', 'version', 'Elizabeth', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'perfect', 'job', 'portraying', 'jerk', 'husband', 'Marsha', 'Mason', 'fantastic', 'evil', 'mother', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'jobs', 'very', 'well', 'role', 'cast', 'perfectly.Every', 'scene', 'movie', 'necessary', 'Nothing', 'wasted', 'line', 'dialogue', 'counts', 'flashbacks', 'childdhood', 'are', 'integrated', 'perfectly', 'rest', 'movie.There', 'are', 'interesting', 'camera', 'angles', 'here', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'example', 'flashback', 'where', 'mudpie', 'made', 'dining', 'room', 'young', 'Elizabeth', 'sitting', 'chair', 'shaky', 'scared', 'mother', 'had', 'just', 'yelled', 'camera', 'focused', 'camera', '90', 'degrees', 'then', 'face', 'up', 'smile', 'quot', 'Hi', 'Fred', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'particular', 'kind', 'camera', 'shot', 'also', 'way', 'later', 'when', 'grown', 'up', 'Elizabeth', 'making', 'salad', 'camera', 'pepper', 'grinder', 'end', 'dream', 'sequence', 'end', 'movie', 'various', 'lighting', 'camera', 'angles', 'suggest', 'play', 'being', 'performed', 'live', 'stage.The', 'low', 'budget', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'give', 'nice', 'old', 'fashioned', 'touch', 'film', 'example', 'cheap', 'physical', 'effects', 'gears', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'shown', 'when', 'Velcro', 'Head', 'head', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'charm', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'expensive', 'CGI.The', 'movie', 'timeless', 'only', 'real', 'clue', 'when', 'movie', 'place', 'flashback', 'breakfast', 'scene', 'young', 'Elizabeth', 'father', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'heading', 'first', 'man', 'moon.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'opinion', 'dream', 'sequence', 'everything', 'afterwards', 'last', '25', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'elevate', 'what', 'part', 'really', 'most', 'course', 'order', 'understand', 'need', 'see', 'entire', 'movie', 'good', 'thing', 'entire', 'movie', 'watching.This', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'what', 'be', 'child', 'anyone', 'who', 'sense', 'fun', 'love', 'life', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'hurt', 'bullying', 'movie', 'big', 'heart', 'big', 'sense', 'fun', 'big', 'sense', 'humor', 'big', 'love', 'life']",N/A

302862,A276BSDSBYTULH,6302229847,"Jason Kleeberg ""J. Kleeberg""","[0, 0]","Drop Dead Fred (1991)Director:  Ate de JongWriter:  Carlos Davis, Elizabeth LivingstonStarring:  Phoebe Cates, Rik Mayall, Marsha Mason, Tim MathesonWatching Drop Dead Fred as an adult is 100% different from watching Drop Dead Fred as a kid.  Yes, I know that certain movies are like that - you'll pick up on jokes that you didn't get when you were eight years old...however, most don't give you an entirely different experience.If you haven't seen Drop Dead Fred, the basic synopsis is about a girl who goes to live with her (terrible) mother after she loses her car, her husband, and her job.  As a kid, I remember cracking up at Fred's antics, flinging boogers at people and looking up the skirts of unsuspecting women.  As an adult, this movie really ventures into dark territory. It's about a girl, verbally (and possibly physically) abused by her mother - so much so that her father ends up leaving.  Finally an adult, she escapes the throngs of her household only to find herself completely co-dependent on men, and ends up in another abusive relationship - this time with an abusive husband.  All the while, she conjures up an imaginary friend named Fred (who has a British accent, much like her father).Watching this as an adult, this movie has some heavy things going for it.  Lizzy, the main character, definitely has issues upon issues.  It's actually fun to see her transformation from co-dependent to independent.Fred's humor doesn't exactly do it for me anymore, but the scenes in which he's simply making Lizzy's body move are still hilarious (a standout scene in an Italian restaurant comes to mind).  The acting is fairly pedestrian, the only real standout being Phoebe Cates as Lizzy.  Since this, the director went back overseas and hasn't done any movies that I've heard of since then.Kids movies were definitely different back then.  Watching this now, I can honestly say that I don't think this is a good movie for kids, but if you saw it when you were younger, it's definitely worth another exploration now.Final Score: 3/5",3,"Much, much different watching this as an adult.",1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,2047,"['Drop', 'Dead', 'Fred', '1991', 'Director', 'Ate', 'JongWriter', 'Carlos', 'Davis', 'Elizabeth', 'LivingstonStarring', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'Rik', 'Mayall', 'Marsha', 'Mason', 'Tim', 'MathesonWatching', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Fred', 'adult', '100', '%', 'different', 'watching', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Fred', 'kid', 'Yes', 'know', 'certain', 'movies', 'are', ""'ll"", 'pick', 'up', 'jokes', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'when', 'were', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'however', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'entirely', 'different', 'experience.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Fred', 'basic', 'synopsis', 'girl', 'who', 'live', 'terrible', 'mother', 'car', 'husband', 'job', 'kid', 'remember', 'cracking', 'up', 'Fred', 'antics', 'flinging', 'boogers', 'people', 'looking', 'up', 'skirts', 'unsuspecting', 'women', 'adult', 'movie', 'really', 'ventures', 'dark', 'territory', 'girl', 'verbally', 'possibly', 'physically', 'abused', 'mother', 'so', 'much', 'father', 'up', 'leaving', 'Finally', 'adult', 'throngs', 'household', 'only', 'find', 'completely', 'co-dependent', 'men', 'up', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'time', 'abusive', 'husband', 'while', 'up', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'named', 'Fred', 'who', 'British', 'accent', 'much', 'father', '.Watching', 'adult', 'movie', 'heavy', 'things', 'going', 'Lizzy', 'main', 'character', 'definitely', 'issues', 'issues', 'actually', 'fun', 'see', 'transformation', 'co-dependent', 'independent.Fred', 'humor', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'do', 'anymore', 'scenes', 'simply', 'making', 'Lizzy', 'body', 'move', 'are', 'still', 'hilarious', 'standout', 'scene', 'Italian', 'restaurant', 'mind', 'acting', 'fairly', 'pedestrian', 'only', 'real', 'standout', 'being', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'Lizzy', 'director', 'went', 'back', 'overseas', ""n't"", 'done', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'then.Kids', 'movies', 'were', 'definitely', 'different', 'back', 'then', 'Watching', 'now', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'kids', 'saw', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'definitely', 'worth', 'exploration', 'now.Final', 'Score', '3/5']",N/A

During one viewing, they asked me why someone would have an imaginary friend.  Both said they had never had one.  I told them that, based on what we were seeing in Drop Dead Fred, children invent imaginary friends because they are having hard times with childhood, they might have sad family problems or mean parents.  Inventing an imaginary friend is apparently one way to cope with such conditions.Well, the kids took this information to school with them, and spread it all around.  Seems a few of the kids in their social orbits had (or in the past had had) imaginary friends, so all of a sudden it is rumored in school that these kids come from abusive or problem homes with bad or mean mothers.

It was cheap, and I've got a little bit of a thing for Rik Mayall, he's funny, and he knows how to make you laugh. I only really knew Phoebe Cates from Gremlins, but thought why not?What I didn't think I would be feeling, upon finishing watching Drop Dead Fred, was sad. It was actually a really sad film, and I didn't expect to feel sad after it finished. Yes, it has it's funny moments, but oh my god, it was sad.The story goes that when Lizzie finds herself separated from her cheating rat of a husband (cut it off, that will teach him), and living back home with her ever so slightly controlling mother, she brings back her imaginary childhood friend - Fred, a zany guy, who does everything he can to make her look and sound strange to her friends and her mother. Leads for some very funny moments, but also some very sad moments, when Lizzie realises that she wants to get back with her husband (idiot) and tries to stop Fred being there so much.I think I perhaps would have felt differently about it if I had seen it many years ago, when it originally was out. I think it can be seen differently through the eyes of an adult and a child. A child will see the zany goofiness, the adult will see and understand the controlling atmosphere that Lizzie had to put up with, and why she brings back Fred.The finale was the saddest part for me, with it being almost set up for a sequel, something tells me though it wouldn't have worked, and the absolute sad although predictable, ending. Yes, you can see it coming. You know exactly what's going to happen, in fact it's regularly used for this kind of film.Drop Dead Fred is something that needs to be picked up for cheap, and watched immediately. Although Rik is more toned down than he is for example in Bottom, he's still hilarious, with the zany faces, and funny clothes.

I remember my father who had passed away, went and took me to this movie, and I had always wanted a realistic imaginary friend like Fred (played by Rik Mayall). This movie has a lot of fun memories for me. Phoebe Cates plays a now adult Lizzie who is still struggling against standing up for herself against her mom and now husband. You get to see how her and Fred hook up and why he's there in flashbacks to her childhood. To help her have fun during the rough times in her when she was little and until she's happy and standing on her own as an adult. Because that's what an imaginary friend does he/she let's you escape from realities.Some may not get this movie. But it is a campy, classic, comedy for about young adults to adults.

It's really touching, and endearing.Phoebe Cates plays Lizzie, a 20-something frumpy housewife who is going through a dozen crisis' at once: the theft of her car, the loss of her job, and her emminent divorce - ALL within one hour! So, homeless and distraught, she reluctantly returns to her childhood home to stay with her overbearing mother (Marsha Mason). While there, she rediscovers a long-forgotten toy: a music-box toy that plays 'pop-goes-the-weasle'. When she removes the yellowed taped, out pops Drop Dead Fred (Rik Mayall), who had been trapped in there for over 20 years!Almost immediately, Fred starts getting Lizzie into major trouble. His intentions are honorable, but his executions are always cause for alarm. While trying to help her get back with Charles (Tim Matheson), he accidentally sinks the home of Lizzie's friend, Janie (Carrie Fisher). While trying to alleviate Lizzie's stress, he inadvertantly adds to it by making it appear to everyone that Lizzie is, in fact, crazy.Well, in the end, Fred actually does help Lizzie out, sans bad outcomes. He takes her on a trip into her own mind, where she must battle caricatures of those controlling her life (Mason &amp; Matheson), and free her trapped-self (Ashley Peldon). Now that Lizzie is no longer alone (she now has herself within herself), Fred isn't needed. He disappears (seemingly for good), and Lizzie finally has to courage to stand up to her adulterous husband, and escape the shell her mother has kept in for twenty years.As she is getting her life back together, she visits an old friend, Mickey Bunce (Ron Eldard). While they are talking, the babysitter walks out, claiming that Mickey's daughter, Natalie (Kelly Benson), has made a mess in the kitchen. Natalie defends herself, saying that it was not her, but (surprise) Drop Dead Fred!I highly recommend this movie.

I  now say it isn't the stupidest, just one of the stupidest.It is abouta 26 yr. old woman named Lizzy who is very messed up emotionally due to her troubled childhood.  When her husband leaves her, her childhood imaginary friend named Drop Dead Fred comes back into her life.  The only one who believes her is her childhood friend Mickey who also pops back into her life during her (as well as his) divorce.There is a lot of vulgarity in this film.  I didn't think all the curse words were necessary and Drop Dead Fred was far from childlike in terms of innocence.  However, I have rented the film many times mainly because Mickey is hot and also there are some hilarious scenes that still make me double over with laughter.  The funniest is when Lizzy and Mickey are eating in a restaurant and Fred appears and physically makes Lizzy do all kinds of crazy stuff.  Of course no one can see Fred, so Mickey and everyone in the restaurant think she is voluntarily flinging food around the place, making strange gestures, etc.This is definitely not a film for young children.

Phoebe Cates is well cast as the girl with an unfaithful husband, an overbearing mother, a stolen car, and a lost job.  At that stress level, any girl is entitled to resurrecting her one and only imaginary friend.  Enter Fred with one problem.  Phoebe has grown up and Fred hasn't.  Though Phoebe is reluctant, Fred is unwittingly a great tonic.  Things start to happen!The faithless husband who is about to dump Phoebe gets a most satisfying comeuppance.  Marsha Mason, who cannot give a bad performance, is icily perfect as the mother who wants to create Phoebe in her own image.  Their shopping trip where Phoebe ends up identically clad as Mom is worth the price of admission.  A nice supporting role by Carrie Fisher who plays Phoebe's older, worldly-wise friend is well paced and lively.To the editorial nay-sayers, it only Fred that does these disgusting things, and he does them with the flair of any average five-year old.  If everyone in the audience hasn't at least pulled some of the antics that Fred did, I am certain he or she had far too sedate a childhood.

302889,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,6302229847,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[1, 3]","Drop Dead Fred is a movie about growing up as a empowered person in this case an empowered woman.  The core premise of this movie is you must take full responsible constant ownership of your self and YOUR LIFE or else suffer the humourous and or disasterous consiquences!The main character now a young lady starts off the movie a child in an adults body.  She was not a grown up in heart for she was not an empowered woman at all she was slave to her mother, husband and freds every whim for she had no backbone.  She had a lamer playboy disrespectful skanktrap cheating husband who functioned as a father figure she lost earlier in life.  She had a domineering mom who did everything to give her daughter the appearance of respect for her decisions in adulthood but in truth merely paid lip service to loving her daughter while ordering every aspect of her childs existence.From an early age the young lady invested all her pains angers confustions and child like fantasy's into a special world.  These unresolved issues took the form of Drop Dead Fred this YES sick twisted rude ego-centric totally self absorbed endlessly playful child like being in a weird carrot topped male adult body.  A child is not polite or nice their fantasy's are annoying and crude which is just what Fred was, I find his nerve wrecking style in this protrayal to be perfect and accurate.Well once her childhood inner friend only she can see by the way is rediscovered Drop Dead Fred is released and instantly takes the young lady in the picture on a mad childish romp through polite society.  The moral of this story is simple you must always be master of your destiny or by default someone else is using you for their purposes.Once you are in command of your own life this movie tells you the most vital lesson one can learn.  ENJOY LIFE AS A CHILD WOULD LET GO AT TIMES.  BE REAL STOP CREATING ARTIFICAL WORLDS THAT ARE CAGES IN WHICH YOU DEPOSIT YOURSELF UNTIL DEATH.  STEP OUT INTO THE WORLD EMBRACE FUN AND CHANGE BY THE SIMPLE ACT OF NEVER LIVING TO PLEASE OTHERS.  HELP OTHERS LOVE OTHERS BUT LIVE FOR YOURSELF AND TAKE SOME TIME IN LIFE TO JUST PLEASE YOURSELF SOMETIMES. LIFE IS A BLAST.This film tells you that in childs play sometimes their is the greatest of adult wisdom.  No matter how complex, intelligent  and sophisticated the adult being their must always in life be room made for the simplicity of play.  The movie shows that if the basic human need for play is not met consciously it will satisfy itself unconsciously.  This movie just lets us have a histerically funny peek into the wild psyche as this mad romp to play comes forth to rescue the young lady in the picture from herself.  In the end she finds her backbone and becomes an empowered woman.Trust me their is nothing on earth more beautiful to behold than a person who owns themselves because they are fully empowered to love both themselves and others in a spirit of unending fun and joy!  This movie teaches empowerment in such a way that me a dull witted old thing me caught the movies empowering message real good.  I like the heavy handed way it hits I understand bluntness and you can't get any more blunt or fun than this movie!This is the wisdom this movie shared with me when I watched it on VHS.",5,ITS AWESOME!,1061078400,"08 17, 2003",2003,3268,"['Drop', 'Dead', 'Fred', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'empowered', 'person', 'case', 'empowered', 'woman', 'core', 'premise', 'movie', 'must', 'take', 'full', 'responsible', 'constant', 'ownership', 'self', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'else', 'suffer', 'humourous', 'disasterous', 'consiquences', 'main', 'character', 'now', 'young', 'lady', 'movie', 'child', 'adults', 'body', 'was', 'not', 'grown', 'up', 'heart', 'was', 'not', 'empowered', 'woman', 'was', 'slave', 'mother', 'husband', 'freds', 'whim', 'had', 'backbone', 'had', 'lamer', 'playboy', 'disrespectful', 'skanktrap', 'cheating', 'husband', 'who', 'functioned', 'father', 'figure', 'lost', 'earlier', 'life', 'had', 'domineering', 'mom', 'who', 'did', 'everything', 'give', 'daughter', 'appearance', 'respect', 'decisions', 'adulthood', 'truth', 'merely', 'paid', 'lip', 'service', 'loving', 'daughter', 'ordering', 'aspect', 'childs', 'early', 'age', 'young', 'lady', 'invested', 'pains', 'angers', 'confustions', 'child', 'fantasy', 'special', 'world', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'took', 'form', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Fred', 'YES', 'sick', 'twisted', 'rude', 'ego-centric', 'totally', 'self', 'absorbed', 'endlessly', 'playful', 'child', 'being', 'weird', 'carrot', 'topped', 'male', 'adult', 'body', 'child', 'not', 'polite', 'nice', 'fantasy', 'are', 'annoying', 'crude', 'just', 'what', 'Fred', 'was', 'find', 'nerve', 'wrecking', 'style', 'protrayal', 'be', 'perfect', 'accurate.Well', 'once', 'childhood', 'inner', 'friend', 'only', 'can', 'see', 'way', 'rediscovered', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Fred', 'released', 'instantly', 'young', 'lady', 'picture', 'mad', 'childish', 'romp', 'polite', 'society', 'moral', 'story', 'simple', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'master', 'destiny', 'default', 'someone', 'else', 'using', 'purposes.Once', 'are', 'command', 'own', 'life', 'movie', 'most', 'vital', 'lesson', 'one', 'can', 'learn', 'ENJOY', 'LIFE', 'A', 'CHILD', 'WOULD', 'LET', 'GO', 'AT', 'TIMES', 'BE', 'REAL', 'STOP', 'CREATING', 'ARTIFICAL', 'WORLDS', 'THAT', 'ARE', 'CAGES', 'IN', 'WHICH', 'YOU', 'DEPOSIT', 'YOURSELF', 'UNTIL', 'DEATH', 'STEP', 'OUT', 'INTO', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'EMBRACE', 'FUN', 'AND', 'CHANGE', 'BY', 'THE', 'SIMPLE', 'ACT', 'OF', 'NEVER', 'LIVING', 'TO', 'PLEASE', 'OTHERS', 'HELP', 'OTHERS', 'LOVE', 'OTHERS', 'BUT', 'LIVE', 'FOR', 'YOURSELF', 'AND', 'TAKE', 'SOME', 'TIME', 'IN', 'LIFE', 'TO', 'JUST', 'PLEASE', 'YOURSELF', 'SOMETIMES', 'LIFE', 'A', 'BLAST.This', 'film', 'tells', 'childs', 'play', 'sometimes', 'greatest', 'adult', 'wisdom', 'matter', 'how', 'complex', 'intelligent', 'sophisticated', 'adult', 'being', 'must', 'always', 'life', 'be', 'room', 'made', 'simplicity', 'play', 'movie', 'basic', 'human', 'need', 'play', 'not', 'met', 'consciously', 'will', 'satisfy', 'unconsciously', 'movie', 'just', 'have', 'histerically', 'funny', 'peek', 'wild', 'psyche', 'mad', 'romp', 'play', 'forth', 'rescue', 'young', 'lady', 'picture', 'herself', 'end', 'backbone', 'empowered', 'woman.Trust', 'nothing', 'earth', 'more', 'beautiful', 'behold', 'person', 'who', 'are', 'fully', 'empowered', 'love', 'others', 'spirit', 'unending', 'fun', 'joy', 'movie', 'empowerment', 'such', 'way', 'dull', 'witted', 'old', 'thing', 'caught', 'movies', 'empowering', 'message', 'real', 'good', 'heavy', 'handed', 'way', 'understand', 'bluntness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'blunt', 'fun', 'movie', 'wisdom', 'movie', 'shared', 'when', 'watched', 'VHS']",N/A
