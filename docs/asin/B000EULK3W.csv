Taylor ""Wyld Weasil""","[51, 51]","Hopefully the first of many post Dime releases, this DVD isn't so much about Pantera or Damageplan at all, but more of a celebration of what he was. The disc contains classic dimebag solos as well as his off the wall personality, playing pranks and stuff. I was suprised at how much old footage from the 80s they were able to pull out. There is one part where they show an early version of Pantera covering Metallica's ""Seek and Destroy"" flawlessly! They even show some earlier solos that went on to become some classic Pantera guitar solos. Aside from the goofy nature of dime, the video gets tasteful with a nice montage of photos through the years and the hour and 15 minute video ends with an inspirational speech from dime that damn near brought me to tears.

If we're reviewing this DVD, then we're fans as well.  However, I'm a little upset at the first installment of Dimevision.Dimevision is just a collection of rare footage as seen through the eyes of Dime and through his family and closest of friends.  Most of these moments are backstage or at Dime's home in Dallas.  What's great is the fascinating footage of Dime as a teen playing in clubs and as opening acts for the likes of Metallica and others.What I didn't like about this DVD is that it should've been more of a documentary of Dime's life with interviews and timelines and whatnot.  I know it's just a collection of his works throughout his time, but I feel that the DVD was poorly organized and didn't really tell the true story of how this great legend came to be.  As a fan, I feel empty knowing that Dime's guitar playing is gone forever.  There is no more Damageplan, there is no more Pantera.  I have a hard time finding a replacement.  Part of me knows there is none and part of me wants there to be none.  This is why Dimevision should've been more of an in depth view into Dime's life with some sense of organization rather than just some random clips from here and there.A legend like Dime deserves a lot more.  I would love to hear the thoughts from Dime's family and friends.  And yes, I had a HUGE problem that Phil was excluded from any scene in this DVD.  I am not a big Phil fan, but you can see the agenda of this DVD a mile away.  That doesn't serve Dime true justice.  But who knows, maybe I'm just not fully appreciating this DVD for what it really is.  Maybe the other volumes will be better.

The positives are video footage of a very young Dimebag playing (and SINGING!) Metallica's ""Seek and Destroy"" live in concert (date not given), various awesome clips of his guitar solos, and a wonderful self-filmed-in a mirror monologue by Dimebag himself talking about recording music, and what comes from the heart.The negatives, while few, are necessary to note.  There seems to be an endless number of clips of Dimebag throwing lit fireworks on friends and bandmates (literally, there's at least 10 different clips), and a clip of Dimebag and a friend driving a truck through the mud on his front lawn that goes on WAY too long.  Plus, there's a dig at Phil Anselmo, and no footage of him is shown in the Pantera concert footage.Nonetheless, it's a great deal for the 10.99 that is being asked for it.  Just don't expect to be blown away.  The best way to describe it is an hour long video of people having fun with a video camera.

I got the Kiss comic that had their blood in the ink in 3rd grade too, remember that.

Music is as personal as any other preferences you have and your personal preferences will change over time, but don't ignore greatness in when it is obvious. If you get this DVD you will be impressed. There's a lot of footage of Dime as a kid playing better than most pro's writing columns for different guitar magazines who are supposed to be in their prime. Dime was incredibly talented and this DVD shows how deep that talent goes, but he was by all accounts (except for one foot-in-the-mouth Anselmo type) a great guy. And if you are looking at reviews for this DVD, you'll see why would you probably would have liked to have met the guy yourself.The audio isn't perfect and neither is the video, but it's just supposed to be what Dime or someone else recorded for posterity's sake.THE DVD IS AWESOME!!!",5,Still in awe ...,1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,1196,"['3rd', 'grade', 'opted', 'new', 'Kiss', 'Double', 'Platinum', 'album', 'instead', 'G', 'Joe', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'grip', 'got', 'Kiss', 'comic', 'had', 'blood', 'ink', '3rd', 'grade', 'too', 'remember', 'Back', 'sunday', 'school', 'classes', 'when', 'evils', 'metal', 'were', 'proclaimed', 'was', 'getting', 'info', 'pick', 'next', 'album', 'buy', 'other', 'words', ""'ve"", 'been', 'partial', 'kind', 'music', 'long', 'time', 'Music', 'as', 'personal', 'other', 'preferences', 'have', 'personal', 'preferences', 'will', 'change', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'greatness', 'when', 'obvious', 'get', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'lot', 'footage', 'Dime', 'kid', 'playing', 'better', 'most', 'pro', 'writing', 'columns', 'different', 'guitar', 'magazines', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'prime', 'Dime', 'was', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'DVD', 'how', 'deep', 'talent', 'was', 'accounts', 'one', 'foot-in-the-mouth', 'Anselmo', 'type', 'great', 'guy', 'are', 'looking', 'reviews', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'would', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'met', 'guy', 'yourself.The', 'audio', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'video', 'just', 'supposed', 'be', 'what', 'Dime', 'someone', 'else', 'recorded', 'posterity', 'sake.THE', 'DVD', 'IS', 'AWESOME']",N/A
979133,A25JHXYK10F0A6,B000EULK3W,"Thomas D. Ryan ""American Hit Network""","[18, 38]","Oh, man. This video is a complete train wreck...and I mean that as a compliment. ""Dimevision Vol 1: That's the Fun I Have"" is a complete mess of the ridiculous and near-ridiculous, interspersing home footage that rivals ""Jackass"" with live clips that convey what Dimebag Darrell was all about. The live clips date back to Pantera circa 1984, including ten minutes from an early gig in Texas where the audience members number less than twenty. Hundreds of photos flash by while a soundtrack plays some of his best recorded moments. Contemporary clips focus almost exclusively on Dimebag's extended solos, as he wrenches all sorts of screams, squawks, and feedback from his much-abused guitar, which seems to be begging for mercy.""Does he play anything nice?""...My wife actually asked me this question while we watched the video together. The answer is ""No, he doesn't."" It's all screeching, brain-numbing guitar solos. Some of the live clips drag on for a bit, but fans will appreciate every second of footage, so it's easy to justify their inclusion here.As for the home videos, insight is not required. Quite obviously, Dimebag had an obsession with fireworks, and I pity anyone who ever passed out in his presence. The video offers plenty of examples of snoozing friends and bandmembers being awakened by a bottle rocket or Roman candle fired in their direction. Stupid tricks with fireworks notwithstanding, the home video footage can be pretty funny, and thankfully, nobody got seriously hurt.Watching this video, it is impossible to understand why anyone - even an insane person - would want to murder this guy. He might have been a complete nut, but the video makes it fairly obvious that he was also a really nice guy who was great to his fans and ultimately harmless. He may not be a household name, but virtually anyone who came of age in the late `80s knows who he is, and this video is for them. I myself didn't know much about the guy, but after watching this video, I think I'm gonna miss him, too.B+  Tom Ryan",3,The First Posthumous Installment,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,2023,"['Oh', 'man', 'video', 'complete', 'train', 'wreck', 'mean', 'compliment', 'Dimevision', 'Vol', '1', 'Fun', 'Have', 'complete', 'mess', 'ridiculous', 'near-ridiculous', 'interspersing', 'home', 'footage', 'Jackass', 'live', 'clips', 'convey', 'what', 'Dimebag', 'Darrell', 'was', 'live', 'clips', 'date', 'back', 'Pantera', 'circa', '1984', 'including', 'ten', 'minutes', 'early', 'gig', 'Texas', 'where', 'audience', 'members', 'number', 'less', 'twenty', 'Hundreds', 'photos', 'flash', 'soundtrack', 'best', 'recorded', 'moments', 'Contemporary', 'clips', 'focus', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'Dimebag', 'extended', 'solos', 'sorts', 'screams', 'squawks', 'feedback', 'much-abused', 'guitar', 'be', 'begging', 'mercy', 'play', 'anything', 'nice', 'wife', 'actually', 'asked', 'question', 'watched', 'video', 'together', 'answer', 'No', ""n't"", 'screeching', 'brain-numbing', 'guitar', 'solos', 'live', 'clips', 'drag', 'bit', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'second', 'footage', 'easy', 'justify', 'inclusion', 'here.As', 'home', 'videos', 'insight', 'not', 'required', 'Quite', 'obviously', 'Dimebag', 'had', 'obsession', 'fireworks', 'pity', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'passed', 'out', 'presence', 'video', 'plenty', 'examples', 'snoozing', 'friends', 'bandmembers', 'being', 'awakened', 'bottle', 'rocket', 'Roman', 'candle', 'fired', 'direction', 'Stupid', 'tricks', 'fireworks', 'notwithstanding', 'home', 'video', 'footage', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'funny', 'thankfully', 'nobody', 'got', 'seriously', 'hurt.Watching', 'video', 'impossible', 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'even', 'insane', 'person', 'would', 'want', 'murder', 'guy', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'complete', 'nut', 'video', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'was', 'also', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'great', 'fans', 'ultimately', 'harmless', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'household', 'name', 'virtually', 'anyone', 'who', 'came', 'age', 'late', '80s', 'knows', 'who', 'video', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'guy', 'watching', 'video', 'think', ""'m"", 'gon', 'miss', 'Tom', 'Ryan']",N/A
