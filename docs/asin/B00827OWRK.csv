1544666,A2Q05I3W8HAROC,B00827OWRK,"Amanda Jane Volovik ""Chava""","[0, 0]","Reviewed by Amanda Volovik ""Chava"": When I was watching this movie, I saw the partial correlation with M. Night Shyamalan's 'Devil' but this is without the occult elements. Another reviewer mentioned this too.  There's only so much variety you can expect in a plot set in a stuck, overfilled elevator with an added threat of danger and death. In this case you have to rely on the cast, contrasts between characters, tension and the final reveal of how this trauma transforms these individuals from strong to weak, weak to strong, unassuming to courageous, or just how disaster causes folks to show their true colors.I am not saying this film was intended to be a deep philosophical venture, but to me it's certainly worth 4 stars and the money spent as I enjoyed the symbolic aspects of it. I'm a bit confused by others reviewing this as 'badly acted' I do not find that true at all. It was strongly acted with an excellent ensemble.There are 'messages' throughout the movie about corporate greed and corporate victims, anger at society, unfaithfulness, racism, suicide and other social problems. This represents a cross-section of society playing out their dramas, brought to equality through fear for their mortality -  where they must help each other if they like it or not. The surprise for me was a final burst of heroism and selflessness that added depth to the whole meaning of the movie.",4,"Despite the Partial Retread: Strong Cast, Acting and Heroism Save the Day",1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,1395,"['Reviewed', 'Amanda', 'Volovik', 'Chava', 'When', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'saw', 'partial', 'correlation', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', ""'Devil"", 'occult', 'elements', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'too', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'variety', 'can', 'expect', 'plot', 'set', 'stuck', 'overfilled', 'elevator', 'added', 'threat', 'danger', 'death', 'case', 'have', 'rely', 'cast', 'characters', 'tension', 'final', 'reveal', 'how', 'trauma', 'individuals', 'strong', 'weak', 'weak', 'strong', 'unassuming', 'courageous', 'just', 'how', 'disaster', 'folks', 'show', 'true', 'colors.I', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'film', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'venture', 'certainly', 'worth', '4', 'stars', 'money', 'spent', 'enjoyed', 'symbolic', 'aspects', ""'m"", 'bit', 'confused', 'others', 'reviewing', ""'badly"", 'acted', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'true', 'was', 'strongly', 'acted', 'excellent', 'are', ""'messages"", 'movie', 'corporate', 'greed', 'corporate', 'victims', 'anger', 'society', 'unfaithfulness', 'racism', 'suicide', 'other', 'social', 'problems', 'cross-section', 'society', 'playing', 'out', 'dramas', 'brought', 'equality', 'fear', 'mortality', 'where', 'must', 'help', 'other', 'like', 'not', 'surprise', 'was', 'final', 'burst', 'heroism', 'selflessness', 'added', 'depth', 'whole', 'meaning', 'movie']",N/A

I don't exactly regret having watched it, but I won't recommend it, either.I honestly don't think the actors were bad at all.  The script was even all right as far as the dialog went, imho, but it was the ending that was a real let down.  After all that happened, the ending was so ""meh"" that I felt cheated.Sort of spoilerish, but not bad as this is revealed early on -The people on the elevator are going to a party, the purpose of it being that the big-wig of a company will announce his retirement with a 75 million dollar payout - to himself.  One of the passengers, resentful and hurt by the actions of this man and his company, has a ""message"" to deliver.  This ""message"" is not fated to be delivered as planned, as all become stuck in the elevator, which was not the person's intention.The little girl who causes all of the trouble is so annoying that I wish I could have slapped her.  She was so frustrating that it was over the top annoying for me.  I do admit that towards the ending of the movie I liked her better in that she regretted her actions and showed true remorse.  I don't think she'll ever be the same spoiled brat again. But again, the ending was so ""meh"" that you can't really be sure.The passengers take a moronically long time to even consider trying to open the doors, and then when that route fails, to try any other way to dispose of the bomb.  I know that having any of them show any intellect would have ruined the story, but on the other hand, a better writing team should have anticipated this and created realistic obstacles, not just have these people behave like stupid puppets.After all, if you only have minutes left to live, would you stand around moralizing or dicking around???  No!  That part was VERY frustrating and if it wasn't for the fact that the movie was about to finish I would have abandoned it.The three stars mean that I didn't hate the movie.  Three stars, or a ""qualified"" high 2 score shows that I think it had potential to be better executed than it turned out being.All in all, this is better than a lot of the movies that Amazons offers free on Prime, but I would have regretted it if I had purchased this.If the ending had been better, or at least tried to tie up some of the drama between the passengers or with their lives, it would have been better.

That glitch resolved at the point where she's dead, there's blood all over the elevator and one passenger is seriously injured.  What in the world happened???With that in mind, my review is somewhat speculative.  I enjoyed the movie even with the major glitch.

1544684,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00827OWRK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 4]","Elevator (Stig Svendsen, 2011)I find myself at something of a disadvantage as I write this review. I have not seen John Erick Dowdle's Devil, the movie which I assume Elevator is a mockbuster. (Oddly, this is the second mockbuster I've seen today, viz. the Terror Trap review, not produced by The Asylum; Quite Nice Pictures, the company who bankrolled this, makes their debut here.) The basic premise is the same, though Elevator doesn't have the supernatural bent; you get a bunch of disparate people who don't really like each other all that much and trap them in an elevator.In this case, we have nine different ones who are on their way up to the penthouse of a midtown office building, where the rarely-seen CEO of a major investment firm, Henry Barton (The Social Network's John Getz), is going to be making an announcement. Barton, along with his spoiled-brat granddaughter Madeline (played at various times by the Pace twins, Amanda and Rachel, who have a recurring role on the TV series Weeds), is on the elevator. Three of his employees are also there--Don Handley (3 Days Gone's Christopher Backus), who's brought along his fiancee Maureen (Argo's Tehmina Sunny), a local newscaster); Celine Fouquet (La Monja's Anita Briem), who works in the cubicle next to Don; and their pal Martin Gossling (Surrogates' Devin Ratray). Also along for the ride are George Axelrod (Boston Public's Joey Slotnick), a stand-up comic who's a last-minute replacement for an entertainer who had to cancel; Jane Redding (Paul Blart: Mall Cop's Shirley Knight), a major investor with the firm; and Mohammed (The Men Who Stare at Goats' Waleed Zuaiter), the building's security guard. Axelrod is claustrophobic, and is having problems being crammed into an elevator with so many people; while Redding offers him a bit of Dutch courage (which he gratefully accepts), Madeline, who's the kind of brat you just want to slap senseless every time she opens her mouth, decides to hit the emergency stop button and give Axelrod a scare. Well, girls will be girls, no harm no foul--except that the sudden stop messes with the elevator's brakes, causing the bunch to be stuck there. Tensions boil to the surface almost immediately; Axelrod has made no secret of his racism, directing barbed comments at Mohammed since he got on the elevator, Jane has a bone to pick with Don, Madeline's a bitch, Celine is pregnant (and if you've ever been, or known anyone, pregnant, you know what that means for being without a restroom for any length of time), and the list goes on.  Things get a great deal worse when--I would consider this a spoiler, but it's in the Netflix plot synopsis, and according to Amazon it's also part of the jacket copy--the denizens of the elevator discover that one of them is carrying a bomb.I realize that thrillers, almost as much as the horror movies of which I am so fond, rely on much of their plot advancement coming at the expense of stupid characters making bad decisions. But the characters in this movie are so stupid that... well, I'll put it this way: it takes them until minute forty-nine of the movie's eighty-one-minute running time to decide to try opening the doors to find out whether the elevator got stuck in a place where they would actually be able to simply walk out of it. Are you serious? How is that not the first thing that came into someone's head? And when there are nine heads in the elevator, the problem is nine times worse, as far as I'm concerned. I've watched thousands of movies over the course of my life (my quite incomplete spreadsheet lists over 3,500), and in that time, I have turned off less than a dozen without any intention of ever going back and finishing watching them. When this movie hit minute thirty without anyone coming up with that idea, I was sorely tempted. In all honesty, I probably only kept watching for Briem, who's ridiculously gorgeous, but who may well have the worst agent in the world; every movie I've seen her in has been awful. Usually she ends up being a very big fish, acting-wise, in a very small pond, but that wasn't the case here; Svendsen, a New Jersey-educated Norwegian, assembled quite a cast for this dog, and he still couldn't manage to get anything good out of it. If you're going to have a Jew and a Muslim throwing epithets at each other for eighty minutes, you should at least recognize you're playing to clich&eacute; and try to put some sort of interesting spin on it, no? No. At least, not in this case. And yet for some reason I decided to finish the movie in some vain hope that it might get better. More fool me. ",1,Cut the cables.

1544688,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00827OWRK,trebe,"[0, 0]","Directed by Stig Svendsen, Elevator (2012) is a very engaging suspense thriller, set mostly inside an elevator car, where while on their way to a gathering in the penthouse, a group of passengers end up stuck inside an elevator car facing death.  There are a number of twists to the story, so the film is probably best viewed without too much foreknowledge, however the DVD cover which depicts a woman crawling out from the car is misleading.  Mild spoilers follow.Henry Barton (John Getz), the CEO of an investment company, boards an elevator with his granddaughter Madeline (played by twins Rachel and Amanda Pace), on his way to a party in the penthouse of a building owned by his company.  Nine passengers find themselves in trouble, when the car unexpectedly stops near the top, and then drops several floors, before coming to rest over forty floors up.  The group uses the phone in the cab to call for help, but apparently it will be some time before assistance arrives.As events play out, each of the characters gets an opportunity to assume the spotlight, but it is the Barton's who emerge as key figures.  Henry Barton's actions caused a personal tragedy for one of the passengers, which has made the current situation much more than a mere mechanical failure.  And young Madeline Barton's penchant for pushing elevator buttons, has disastrous results.  Matters inside the car escalate to radical levels, ultimately becoming desperate and bloody, as things do not end in a tidy storybook fashion.The group are able to use their cell phones to call out, and even stream video, but considering their dire situation, the level of communication seems remarkably low.  The dreadfully slow response by those outside, leaves the group to their own devices, for far too long.While some elements don't make too much sense, if you buy into to the premise, the movie is extremely entertaining, as the writing manages to make what happens believable.  The dialog is edgy and quite pointed, and the acting is outstanding.  George Axelrod (Joey Slotnick) a standup comic, and Mohammed (Waleed Zauiter) a security guard, are both a little over the top, and bring a racial element to the situation.  As the movie reaches critical mass, Axelrod unexpectedly steps up, and takes over.  Veteran actors Shirley Knight and John Getz both deliver key performances, while Christopher Backus, Anita Briem (The Nun), Devin Ratray, and Tehmina Sunny, are also very good.Although the elevator car seems much larger than it should be, Stig Svendsen does a nice job of making what happens inside the car seem quite real.  The film could have had more to say, and the ending could definitely have been stronger, and tied up a few more loose ends, but Elevator is still a solidly entertaining movie well worth seeing.",4,a nightmarish trip up to the penthouse...,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,2795,"['Directed', 'Stig', 'Svendsen', 'Elevator', '2012', 'very', 'engaging', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'set', 'mostly', 'elevator', 'car', 'where', 'way', 'gathering', 'penthouse', 'group', 'passengers', 'end', 'up', 'stuck', 'elevator', 'car', 'facing', 'death', 'are', 'number', 'twists', 'story', 'film', 'probably', 'best', 'viewed', 'too', 'much', 'foreknowledge', 'however', 'DVD', 'cover', 'woman', 'crawling', 'out', 'car', 'misleading', 'Mild', 'spoilers', 'follow.Henry', 'Barton', 'John', 'Getz', 'CEO', 'investment', 'company', 'boards', 'elevator', 'granddaughter', 'Madeline', 'played', 'twins', 'Rachel', 'Amanda', 'Pace', 'way', 'party', 'penthouse', 'building', 'owned', 'company', 'Nine', 'passengers', 'find', 'trouble', 'when', 'car', 'unexpectedly', 'stops', 'top', 'then', 'drops', 'several', 'floors', 'coming', 'rest', 'forty', 'floors', 'up', 'group', 'phone', 'cab', 'call', 'help', 'apparently', 'will', 'be', 'time', 'assistance', 'arrives.As', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'characters', 'opportunity', 'assume', 'spotlight', 'Barton', 'who', 'emerge', 'key', 'figures', 'Henry', 'Barton', 'actions', 'caused', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'one', 'passengers', 'made', 'current', 'situation', 'much', 'more', 'mere', 'mechanical', 'failure', 'young', 'Madeline', 'Barton', 'penchant', 'pushing', 'elevator', 'buttons', 'disastrous', 'results', 'Matters', 'car', 'escalate', 'radical', 'levels', 'ultimately', 'becoming', 'desperate', 'bloody', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'tidy', 'storybook', 'fashion.The', 'group', 'are', 'able', 'use', 'cell', 'phones', 'call', 'out', 'even', 'stream', 'video', 'considering', 'dire', 'situation', 'level', 'communication', 'remarkably', 'low', 'dreadfully', 'slow', 'response', 'outside', 'group', 'own', 'devices', 'far', 'too', 'long.While', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'too', 'much', 'sense', 'buy', 'premise', 'movie', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'writing', 'make', 'what', 'believable', 'dialog', 'edgy', 'quite', 'pointed', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'George', 'Axelrod', 'Joey', 'Slotnick', 'standup', 'comic', 'Mohammed', 'Waleed', 'Zauiter', 'security', 'guard', 'are', 'little', 'top', 'bring', 'racial', 'element', 'situation', 'movie', 'critical', 'mass', 'Axelrod', 'unexpectedly', 'up', 'over', 'Veteran', 'actors', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'John', 'Getz', 'deliver', 'key', 'performances', 'Christopher', 'Backus', 'Anita', 'Briem', 'Nun', 'Devin', 'Ratray', 'Tehmina', 'Sunny', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'elevator', 'car', 'much', 'larger', 'should', 'be', 'Stig', 'Svendsen', 'nice', 'job', 'making', 'what', 'car', 'seem', 'quite', 'real', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'say', 'ending', 'could', 'definitely', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'tied', 'up', 'few', 'more', 'loose', 'ends', 'Elevator', 'still', 'solidly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A
