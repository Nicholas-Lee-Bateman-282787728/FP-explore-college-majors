Its full meaning is so subtle, I'm not sure I completely grasped it.  As an overview, ""Skellig"" is a beautiful, touching and fascinating movie, even if some of the pieces never seem to gel.  For example, what's with all those insects, not only serving as Skellig's food, but making an appearance in the boy's school?  And in the long run, who the heck is Skellig, anyway?I bought this because I'm a fan of John Simm, and although he's something of a background character, he delivers sympathetically and emotionally as always.  Tim Roth, a fabulous actor, is predictably believable and great.Ultimately, this is an uplifting story, although it's a bit uncomfortable getting there.
