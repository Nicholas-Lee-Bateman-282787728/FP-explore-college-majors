The only way you could write up a good review for this junk is if you worked on the movie, other wise I just call B.S. on any review higher then 2 stars. This is one of those ""Monster"" movies that is better left in the shadows and not in the light as you can plainly see this lame actor is wearing a costume with no make up. Why would you use a bright light in every other scene to light up every flaw in the costume and not use a little make up to blend it all in ? It really is worth seeing just so you can point and mock at the sad final cut. If your are not into seeing poor film making, bad acting and shoddy story telling stay away from this mess.",1,What a waist of time,1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,753,"['What', 'waist', 'time', 'really', 'cool', 'spike', 'costume', 'Who', 'good', 'movie', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'write', 'up', 'good', 'review', 'junk', 'worked', 'movie', 'other', 'wise', 'just', 'call', 'B.S', 'review', 'higher', 'then', '2', 'stars', 'one', 'Monster', 'movies', 'better', 'left', 'shadows', 'not', 'light', 'can', 'plainly', 'see', 'lame', 'actor', 'wearing', 'costume', 'make', 'up', 'Why', 'would', 'use', 'bright', 'light', 'other', 'scene', 'light', 'up', 'flaw', 'costume', 'not', 'use', 'little', 'make', 'up', 'blend', 'really', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'point', 'mock', 'sad', 'final', 'cut', 'are', 'not', 'seeing', 'poor', 'film', 'making', 'bad', 'acting', 'shoddy', 'story', 'telling', 'stay', 'away', 'mess']",Spike

It's sort of a cross between BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (EDWARD THISTLEHANDS?) w/ a bit more blood. I did enjoy the female characters, including a tough, resourceful chick w/ medical knowledge. There's also a guy who spends most of the movie on his back, bleeding. As for the ""monster"" himself, he's an emotional wreck, unable to get past the lost love of his life. Is it sappy? Yes. Does it drag on? Yes. Is it a complete catastrophe? No. I liked the beginning and the ending. The middle part gets long-winded, meandering a lot. If this had been about 20-30 minutes shorter, it could have been a classic...

It's a bizarre love story, a tragic fairy tale, and/or a retelling of Beauty and the Beast.  For all you gorehounds out there, this film is pretty much garbage.  Sorry, it's like making love to a cactus.I suffered and took one for the team.  Now I'll make this quick and painless.  A group of people have a tire blow out in the woods and get attacked by a thorny monster.  Well, actually they aren't attacked, this poor spiked freak just wants to be loved.  His inability for human interaction is so sad.This prickly idea might have stood a chance if it wasn't for the retarded dialogue.  (Thorn man speaking to woman with rose belt)--""His love of 80 years couldn't compare to my love of just one day"".  Gag!  Maybe I am just an insensitive prick, but that fiercely grated on my nerves.  Throw in the fact this had no real sense of danger or suspense after the first half hour, and this movie drastically misses the mark.  Well, I suppose I am not the target audience.SPIKE would have been cool as a gory comedy.  Several rape scenes with heavy sarcasm would have been hilarious.  Or a misunderstood monster wallowing in self-pity as his dates get poked in more ways than one.  Maybe play some MC Hammer ""Can't touch this"" in the background.  That would have been awesome.Okay, sorry to poke fun.

They come face to face with a beast that shares a connection with one of them.The good news is that the costume design is great.  For being a low-budget flick, the overall video quality was better than most Redbox movies.The bad news is that the movie is just boring.  Lots of mediocre acting, laughably bad animal scenes, minimal gore, and the most annoyingly emo monster in film history.  The romantic dialogue is corny, and the film's pacing is awful.  To make matters worse, Amazon and IMDB both are completely littered with fake positive reviews for the film.Beauty and the Beast has left the building.

I wouldn't even have seen this if it wasn't on the list at my local Redbox. It looked cool and the spike monster looked cool. I thought it couldn't hurt to rent this.Boy, was I ever wrong. The plotline seems reasonable enough at first for a horror-movie with a bunch of young'uns skidding off the road after a spike causes a flat tire (which is actually several spikes attached to what looks like flesh/skin) but it quickly degenerates into a silly plot (and I do mean quickly) Infact, I'd have to say the ending was the best part of the film. Not just because it was over, but it ended on such a tragic note *SPOILER ALERT* that I could not help but laugh after the general cheesiness of the rest of the film... the girl accidentally gets impaled on the spikes when she falls over a cliff and Spike Man pulls her back up and pulls her close, thus impaling her on his body, and she dies. Woohoo derpity derp.The best thing about the movie was the spike costume. Seriously. Out of EVERYTHING in the film, the spike costume was better than anything else.On top of that, there is no subtitle option at all, or closed captioning. It is 20-freaking-10, there is NO excuse to not include one and/or the other onto DVDs, so most of the time, I had no idea what was being said since my hearing sucks. But I didn't have to hear the dialogue to know this movie was bad.
