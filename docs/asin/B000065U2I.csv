700002,A2XXV9HF169LCF,B000065U2I,A. Trotter,"[29, 31]","The start of the DVD, where you have to go through all the company's crud that made the DVD, is really really annoying. Scott is fairly easy to follow, but I'm still not all the way through the DVD. I wish he went into some stretches, and how you're supposed to breathe and all a bit more; he goes a bit fast, sometimes. Which may seem a strange complaint, given he's moving in slooooow motion, but this is the very first time I've ever tried this stuff; I'm not just in it to learn the forms, I'm in a remote area and have no other way to learn this stuff. I guess I was hoping for a bit more of an introduction to Tai Chi; but if you already have a bit of experience in yoga or martial arts, and just want to learn &amp; practice with the basic forms, this is a good DVD.",4,Good for begining,1035676800,"10 27, 2002",2002,773,"['start', 'DVD', 'where', 'have', 'go', 'company', 'crud', 'made', 'DVD', 'really', 'really', 'annoying', 'Scott', 'fairly', 'easy', 'follow', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'way', 'DVD', 'wish', 'went', 'stretches', 'how', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'breathe', 'bit', 'more', 'bit', 'fast', 'sometimes', 'Which', 'may', 'seem', 'strange', 'complaint', 'given', 'moving', 'slooooow', 'motion', 'very', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'tried', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'learn', 'forms', ""'m"", 'remote', 'area', 'have', 'other', 'way', 'learn', 'stuff', 'guess', 'was', 'hoping', 'bit', 'more', 'introduction', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'already', 'have', 'bit', 'experience', 'yoga', 'martial', 'arts', 'just', 'want', 'learn', 'amp', 'practice', 'basic', 'forms', 'good', 'DVD']",Discover Tai Chi for Beginners - Workout Essentials Digital

I've done his workouts and never felt tired while doing them, but I felt the results all day, so I know the workouts work. A good buy for anyone not familiar with Tai Chi and wants a good workout. He also has some great workout tips, eating and health tips on the feature portions of his DVD's. The workouts are usually 45 minutes, which are designed to take you through the movements. Then at the end of the DVD is the whole workout which you can do once you are familiar with the movements.

I thought this would be more comfortable than something obviously marketed to women.I was wrong.While I have nothing against, Tai Chi for the exercise value, I am not into waving my arms around to usher ""waves of self love and acceptance"" over me.  What a pile!  Come on!  Really?I think the audience would be better served without the psuedo-spiritual dung pile that accompanies any actual physical exercise.

That is why he meets with no difficulty."" ~Lao TzuFirstly this workout DVD has so many features it was quite amazing. If you are new to Tai Chi this is a perfect place to start. The music is soothing and exotic, the scenery is beautiful and the instructor's voice is calming.Secondly, I could actually do the workout on the first try. Tai Chi looks difficult when it is done too quickly. On many other DVDs I felt that I could not learn the moves fast enough so I gave up. Scott Cole moves at a perfect pace.Scott Cole focuses on guiding you through Tai Chi postures and training techniques. He blends martial and healing arts in order to empower you and motivate you to move in a healing direction. He was named one of the Top 5 Fitness Instructors in the world and has appeared in over 300 publications worldwide.DVD Contents:1. Play Features - Plays all the features2. Chapter Selections - Pushing the Wave, Beautiful Woman Turns Her Waist, Grounded Chi Journey in Hawaii, Parting Horses Mane3. Special Features - Postures with Narration, Postures With Music, Workbook Slideshow, Hawaii Workout to Music.4. Audio Features - Dolby Digital 2.0 and 5.1The benefits of this DVD are immediately apparent:Renewed StrengthUpper Body Warming - blood flow definitely increases in the upper body.Increased FlexibilityIncrease in Energy and ConfidenceThis Tai Chi workout is the best I've ever tried. It was easy to learn the exercises and I also had a few great laughs because, well, some of the postures and movements are rather funny the first time you do them.Once you have learned the moves you can then try the workouts with just music. Once you have memorized the workouts you may find yourself wanting to do the exercises outside. The exercise routines can be done almost anywhere and you need very little space to do them indoors at home.~The Rebecca Review",5,Perfect Introduction to Tai Chi,1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,1897,"['alive', 'difficulty', 'why', 'difficulty', 'TzuFirstly', 'workout', 'DVD', 'so', 'many', 'features', 'was', 'quite', 'amazing', 'are', 'new', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'perfect', 'place', 'start', 'music', 'soothing', 'exotic', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'instructor', 'voice', 'calming.Secondly', 'could', 'actually', 'do', 'workout', 'first', 'try', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'difficult', 'when', 'done', 'too', 'quickly', 'many', 'other', 'DVDs', 'felt', 'could', 'not', 'learn', 'moves', 'fast', 'enough', 'gave', 'up', 'Scott', 'Cole', 'perfect', 'pace.Scott', 'Cole', 'guiding', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'postures', 'training', 'techniques', 'martial', 'healing', 'arts', 'order', 'empower', 'motivate', 'move', 'healing', 'direction', 'was', 'named', 'one', 'Top', '5', 'Fitness', 'Instructors', 'world', 'appeared', '300', 'publications', 'worldwide.DVD', 'Contents:1', 'Play', 'Features', 'features2', 'Chapter', 'Selections', 'Pushing', 'Wave', 'Beautiful', 'Woman', 'Her', 'Waist', 'Grounded', 'Chi', 'Journey', 'Hawaii', 'Parting', 'Horses', 'Mane3', 'Special', 'Features', 'Postures', 'Narration', 'Music', 'Workbook', 'Slideshow', 'Hawaii', 'Workout', 'Music.4', 'Audio', 'Features', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', '5.1The', 'benefits', 'DVD', 'are', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'Renewed', 'StrengthUpper', 'Body', 'Warming', 'blood', 'flow', 'definitely', 'upper', 'body.Increased', 'FlexibilityIncrease', 'Energy', 'ConfidenceThis', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'workout', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'tried', 'was', 'easy', 'learn', 'exercises', 'also', 'had', 'few', 'great', 'laughs', 'well', 'postures', 'movements', 'are', 'rather', 'funny', 'first', 'time', 'do', 'them.Once', 'have', 'learned', 'moves', 'can', 'then', 'try', 'workouts', 'just', 'music', 'Once', 'have', 'memorized', 'workouts', 'may', 'find', 'wanting', 'do', 'exercises', 'exercise', 'routines', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'almost', 'anywhere', 'need', 'very', 'little', 'space', 'do', 'indoors', 'home.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Discover Tai Chi for Beginners - Workout Essentials Digital
