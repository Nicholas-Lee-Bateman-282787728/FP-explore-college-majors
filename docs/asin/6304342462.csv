415663,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304342462,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I remember growing up adoring this little film.  I was about eleven or so when the film was released and it was such a huge hit in my circle of friends.  I probably saw the film nearly fifty times before my thirteenth birthday.  Sadly, I haven't seen the movie since, but the minute my wife asked me `have you ever seen `That Thing You Do?' memories instantly came pouring back and I got really excited.  When she told me that she had never seen it I immediately rented it and forced her to watch it with me.Ten years later and `That Thing You Do' is still as good as I remember.I will say this right off; the film is littered with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, but it's done in such a charismatic and likable way that each of the predictable plot points are easily forgiven.  I am a tad partial, I mean this is a gem of a memory from my youth, so maybe I would be less forgiving had this been the first time I had seen the film, but regardless of my reasoning, my rating is genuine and my adoration of this film is unwavering.It really is that wonderful!The film tells the story of a band called the `One-ders' (eventually changing the spelling to the more understandable `Wonders') who rise to fame in the 60's.  Jimmy is the arrogant lead singer; or the `talent' as some call him.  Lenny, the guitarist, is the crazy one and their bass player (he never gets a name) has joined the army and will only have a short time left with the band.  When Chad, their drummer, acts a fool and breaks his arm the band recruits Guy (the `smart' one) and with Guy's talent and savvy attitude the band is launched into superstardom.  With a business smart manager, a major label, and their own personal fan (Faye, Jimmy's girlfriend), `The Wonders' hit the road as their hit single `That Thing You Do' skyrockets up the charts.But what goes up must come down.As the bands fame continues to grow their loyalties to one another start to fray.  Jimmy allows himself to get too self-consumed; Lenny allows his own sporadic tendencies to tamper with his ability to perform; the bass player (that's so weird, I swear he had a name) allows his future goals to get in the way of his bands success, and left in the wake is Guy who just wants to play, for music is his life.The acting is really golden here, and the entire cast work to elevate the material, making each and every scene memorable and entertaining.  Tom Everett Scott (who totally looks like Tom Hanks in `Big') is great as Guy, evoking the young mans dire passion for his livelihood.  Johnathon Schaech is a completely believable wreck; Steve Zahn (who I am never truly sold on) is utterly hysterical and completely adorable; Ethan Embry is soft and awkward to perfection and Giovanna Ribisi and Charlize Theron really make the most of their limited screen time.  To me though, the films acting chops come from two sources; Liv Tyler and Tom Hanks.  I am not a usual fan of Hanks.  I find him vastly overrated, but here he possesses such a collected cool, a controlled and natural charisma that permeates his every move.  Tyler is a doll, an utter doll here.  She has such a natural beauty, inside and out, and she makes even the most clich&eacute;d and or corny material seem effortlessly realistic.So, you may not fall as deep in love with this little gem as I have, but then again, hopefully you will.  It is nothing short of endlessly entertaining.  The film is about as catchy as the theme song, which never gets old, no matter how many times you head it.",5,I'm totally loving that thing this movie does...,1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,3508,"['remember', 'growing', 'up', 'adoring', 'little', 'film', 'was', 'about', 'eleven', 'so', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'such', 'huge', 'hit', 'circle', 'friends', 'probably', 'saw', 'film', 'nearly', 'fifty', 'times', 'thirteenth', 'birthday', 'Sadly', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'minute', 'wife', 'asked', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Thing', 'Do', 'memories', 'instantly', 'came', 'pouring', 'back', 'got', 'really', 'excited', 'When', 'told', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'immediately', 'rented', 'forced', 'watch', 'me.Ten', 'years', 'later', 'Thing', 'Do', 'still', 'as', 'good', 'remember.I', 'will', 'say', 'right', 'off', 'film', 'littered', 'clich', 'eacute', 'clich', 'eacute', 'done', 'such', 'charismatic', 'likable', 'way', 'predictable', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'easily', 'forgiven', 'am', 'tad', 'partial', 'mean', 'gem', 'memory', 'youth', 'maybe', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'forgiving', 'had', 'been', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'regardless', 'reasoning', 'rating', 'genuine', 'adoration', 'film', 'unwavering.It', 'really', 'wonderful', 'film', 'story', 'band', 'called', 'One-ders', 'eventually', 'changing', 'spelling', 'more', 'understandable', 'Wonders', 'who', 'rise', 'fame', '60', 'Jimmy', 'arrogant', 'lead', 'singer', 'talent', 'call', 'Lenny', 'guitarist', 'crazy', 'one', 'bass', 'player', 'never', 'name', 'joined', 'army', 'will', 'only', 'have', 'short', 'time', 'left', 'band', 'When', 'Chad', 'drummer', 'fool', 'breaks', 'arm', 'band', 'Guy', 'smart', 'one', 'Guy', 'talent', 'savvy', 'attitude', 'band', 'launched', 'superstardom', 'business', 'smart', 'manager', 'major', 'label', 'own', 'personal', 'fan', 'Faye', 'Jimmy', 'girlfriend', 'Wonders', 'hit', 'road', 'hit', 'single', 'Thing', 'Do', 'skyrockets', 'up', 'charts.But', 'what', 'up', 'must', 'come', 'bands', 'fame', 'grow', 'loyalties', 'one', 'start', 'fray', 'Jimmy', 'get', 'too', 'self-consumed', 'Lenny', 'own', 'sporadic', 'tendencies', 'tamper', 'ability', 'perform', 'bass', 'player', 'so', 'weird', 'swear', 'had', 'name', 'future', 'goals', 'get', 'way', 'bands', 'success', 'left', 'wake', 'Guy', 'who', 'just', 'play', 'music', 'life.The', 'acting', 'really', 'golden', 'here', 'entire', 'cast', 'work', 'elevate', 'material', 'making', 'scene', 'memorable', 'entertaining', 'Tom', 'Everett', 'Scott', 'who', 'totally', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Big', 'great', 'Guy', 'evoking', 'young', 'mans', 'dire', 'passion', 'livelihood', 'Johnathon', 'Schaech', 'completely', 'believable', 'wreck', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'who', 'am', 'never', 'truly', 'sold', 'utterly', 'hysterical', 'completely', 'adorable', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'soft', 'awkward', 'perfection', 'Giovanna', 'Ribisi', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'really', 'make', 'most', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'films', 'acting', 'chops', 'come', 'two', 'sources', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'am', 'not', 'usual', 'fan', 'Hanks', 'find', 'vastly', 'overrated', 'here', 'collected', 'cool', 'controlled', 'natural', 'charisma', 'move', 'Tyler', 'doll', 'utter', 'doll', 'here', 'natural', 'beauty', 'inside', 'even', 'most', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'corny', 'material', 'seem', 'effortlessly', 'may', 'not', 'fall', 'as', 'deep', 'love', 'little', 'gem', 'have', 'then', 'again', 'hopefully', 'will', 'nothing', 'short', 'endlessly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'as', 'catchy', 'theme', 'song', 'never', 'old', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'head']",That Thing You Do VHS

The downside is that they become another victim of the title 'one hit wonder'. The film takes place in the 1960's and that's a great way to have this movie. Tom Hanks himself appears in a supporting role as the band's manager. The cast is great. Their characters come off as real people. Tom Everett Scott, who plays Guy, comes off in a very charming, appealing Tom Hanks-y way. He's a star to look forward too in the future. The music itself is superb.

415668,A2582KMXLK2P06,6304342462,B. E Jackson,"[0, 6]","That Thing You Do! was a major disappointment for me.  I believe the only reason the movie became so successful is because it includes Tom Hanks and Liv Tyler, two top name actors and actresses.  The ironic part is that neither one of them is actually involved in a main character moment.  Tom Hanks is the record manager for a young aspiring band called the Wonders, but he never does anything particularly interesting.  Liv plays the role of the girlfriend of a band member but her presence was never really noteworthy or interesting either.  They were both *there* but could have easily been replaced by other actors.The main problem however is that the storyline never does a single exciting thing.  Ever.  Normally when a young band makes it big and releases a hit song, we know where this is going- a crooked manager is going to come out of nowhere and offer them a deal they can't refuse, so they sign it with the assumption that they will remain on top of the world forever.  However Tom Hanks was more or less an honest straight forward man.  He was never someone whose intention was to screw the band over so they never had to suffer the consequences of signing a contract.The band dissolves when friction arises and one key member eventually quits.  From there the band falls apart.  The problem?  It takes over *90 minutes* for this to happen.  All the stuff in between is total fluff involving the band members becoming big, touring, performing concerts, and meeting their idols and other famous people to help their career rise even higher.  It was totally boring.Overall, not one of the more interesting ""aspiring young band makes it big"" type movies out there.  In fact it's one of the worst.

For one thing the advertising banner - ""In every life there comes a time when that dream you dream becomes that thing you do"" hit me the wrong way. After all, 95% of us never wind up doing the dream we dream...there is no WHEN in our lives for this event. Plus, I just figured it was an attempt by Tom Hanks to go highbrow via a directorial debut after those back-to-back Academy Awards. I finally saw the movie over Christmas vacation this year and really loved it. The first half is very upbeat as the band gets started out. They truly are the ""One-ders"", just like many other bands of the Beatles' transitional era. They wrote and performed one song that got them national attention, and then couldn't follow up with anything else. That's too bad, because the band does get one lucky break after another at the start. The guy in the camper that shoves a bowl of stew and a contract in front of them and tells them to ""trust me"" could have had them signing anything. They got lucky that he was legitimate and really did intend to get the record on the air and not steal it from them. That's what makes the disintegration of the band at the end so sad. One by one, they just walk away from their dream. To me, if the movie had any flaw, it was this - the bandmembers just acted like the whole thing was one big amusement park ride rather than a once-in-a-lifetime life changing opportunity.Finally, I also loved all of the authentic looking stage designs. The home appliance store really brought back memories. These type of family owned appliance stores were all over the place back in the 1960's before the big box stores gradually made them extinct. Plus, the appliances being sold looked just like what was available in 1964 right down to the brand names and the styles.I liked the movie so much I went out and got the DVD - it's quite cheap now considering it's over ten years old. The DVD extra content includes six theatrical trailers. The two music videos for the Wonders' songs ""That Thing You Do!"" and ""Dance With Me Tonight"" are included too. There is a 13 minute long ""The Making of That Thing You Do!"" featurette that includes a fair amount of behind the scenes shots and information from Tom Hanks on the film's creation.

415675,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,6304342462,Carlisle Wheeling,"[0, 0]","How do I love That Thing You Do?  Let me count the ways...1.  I've owned the original theatrical release when it first came out on VHS.2.  I bought the excellent, authentic sounding soundtrack.3.  Placed promo and google images of the movie and cast all over my work station at my last job.4.  Purchased the director's two-disc DVD version.In other words, I LOVE this movie and all the things it does.  Great outing for Tom Hanks as a director, this movie tells the story of a group of young hopefuls from Eery, Pennsylvania who are not unlike so many other groups that were influenced by the Beatles and dream of something bigger than playing to the Three Rivers crowd from whence they come.  There is Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) , the drummer who once was in the army, jazz fanatic, and now works in his dad's appliance store while dating the most vain and idiotic girl on earth, Tina, played by a gorgeous Charlize Theron (""Music group"" she says, and Guy lets her get away with it, not using his touted smarts on this one), Jimmy (Johnathan Schaech) who is talented, good-looking, egomaniacal (""I'm reluctant to sign anything that's got to do with my music""--Oh, brother!), and treats his girlfriend Faye (Liv  Tyler) like crap.  At least you can see how they ended up together for a few years because she picks out stupid names for bands like he does.  ""Oneders,"" as in One-ders, which nobody gets except them, just like ""Chord-vettes.""  We have Lenny Haise (Steve Zahn), the crazy funny guy who just wants to have fun.  Yes, he's funny but, just like most of the girls in this film, I wouldn't go out with him either.  And then there's T.B. Player, which is funny all by itself.  We never know his real name, but we know he wants to join the service and has a big jones on for the prettiest member of the Supremes-like Chantrellines.Then we have Tom Hanks who plays their manager Mr. White from Playtone records.  You just know, since Tom Everett Scott looks so much like a younger version of our director, that he would have played the role of Guy himself if he'd dreamed this film up in the early 80s.  The movie follows this group of one-hit Wonders--admittedly great spelling change--on their short-lived rise to the top, resulting in lots of interband turmoil and several comic episodes.One thing that would have made this movie greater is a longer story, and you get it in this edition.  The director's cut, of course, has abrupt freezes to different cuts and ""How many times have I told you not to put milk in the coffee"" keeps popping up, but I enjoy the extra time and info this version provides.  In fact, this is the only version of the movie I play anymore, though some people don't like it.  That's not the point.  The movie is fun, touching, full of lively characters, great retro music, and looks very authentic to 60s enthusiasts or anyone who was old enough to remember the decade the first time around.  In the director's cut, we get to understand the relationship between all the characters better, and we understand Guy's family better too.  They're like mine, and maybe even yours.  The second disc is loaded with great extras, including interviews with most of the cast and they look like they're having fun remeniscing.  There is a making of, pormo spots, and much more.  The features are easily accessible and, even if you don't like the director's cut, the original theatrical release is included here as well, so there's something for everyone on this edition.  Not a bad price for everything you get, and some of the most entertaining moments I've spent with a rock flick, add TTYD with the director's cut and special features to your collection, because even the theatrical version with the extras is enough by itself.

415676,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6304342462,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 2]","That Thing You Do is about a band from Erie, Pennsylvania that got together right around the time that The Beatles were making such a hot fuss. When their drummer breaks his arm just before a big talent show, they recruit Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott). The story is mostly told through his shades, and he is also the catalyst that catapults them to fame, when, nervously, he speeds up their song and wins the contest.-----------------------------Guy: I hadn't played in front of people in so long, so I was nervous, but it sounds better fast. Jimmy wanted it slow, but he was wrong, it's an up-tempo number. And we won!========================================Tom Everett Scott as Guy Patterson is very appealing. He reminds you of a young Tom Hanks, looks-wise. He is very serious about his drums, though he prefers Jazz, and is wise beyond his years -- though he still has some lessons to learn. Like, why is Faye Dolan (Liv Tyler) still with Jimmy Mattingly (Johnathon Schaech) the temperamental songwriter/guitarist who doesn't even treat her very nice when she would be perfect for him?Lenny Haise, played by Steve Zahn, is the clown of the group. He has most of the funny lines, and he also seems to enjoy their quick rise to fame the most. When their record shows signs of being a fluke hit he doesn't worry that it might be their last. He just enjoys the whole rush of fame as if it were a roller coaster ride.------------------------Mr. White: It is very important that you don't stink today.Lenny Haise: Hey, I make no guarantees.================================For a first time director, this is a good effort. Hanks has great love for the era and music, and he tells the story well without becoming too sentimental or cloying, for the most part. His Mr. White is a bit cynical, or maybe just realistic, knowing for The Wonders, a hit song might just be a fluke, and they could end up as One Hit Wonders.------------------Mr. White: You guys look great in red, have I told you that?=============================Is he exploiting them? Maybe just a little, but he is also watching over them. He has seen it before, the common tale of a One-Hit Wonder group. It's not a tragedy if you only have one hit song in life -- one more than most people -- but it can be if you can never get over it. He tries to keep them grounded, but also encourages them to make the most of it while they can.------------------Mr. White: You guys look great in black, have I told you that?=============================They took a lot of care getting the music right, and their song, That Thing You Do, sounds like it could have been a hit in the early 60's. They hired Dwight Twilley to write a song, but the one they ended up using was written by Adam Schlesinger, the bassist of Fountains of Wayne, in response to a contest being held by the studio. All the scenes where music is played work well, from the talent show back in Erie, Pennsylvania, to their cross country tour, all the way to Hollywood, California.Jersey Girl(2004) ....

That said, what really impresses me about ""TTYD"" are the small touches. Director Tom Hanks has been quoted as saying that the songs by Adam Schlesinger (and score by Howard Shore) are original songs- that is, they were written for this film, but they were made, in tempo and arrangement, to *sound* like they came out of the 60's. That's amazing- especially when you re-listen to them. Also impressive are various bits of the day-glo color cinematography, art direction, set pieces (like the Play-Tone 'big record' stage), and even some of the co-stars in their cross country tour (the singer of ""Mr. Downtown"" paying an obvious tribute to Johnny Rivers, and the beautiful ""Chantrellines"" trio a spot-on amalgam of the Crystals, Shirelles, and the Supremes, right down to the coiffed wigs, dresses, hand-claps, and position of the microphones).(P.S.: While I enjoyed Tom Everett Scott immensely, I don't see the resemblance to Tom Hanks that everyone's talking about.

415682,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,6304342462,Craig MACKINNON,"[32, 38]","That this is a charming, fun, all-ages film is obvious simply by listening to the title song, for which the film is named.  It is 1964 and 4 pals have joined together to form a band.  Thee band members are instantly recognisable as ""types,"" but the performances are so genuine and heartfelt that we forgive two-dimensionality.  The lead singer (the brooding genius) has written a catchy tune that allows the band to win a battle of the bands, which in turn lands them a gig at a diner, which in turn.... Well, you get the idea.  The song eventually ends up at #7 on the Billboard chart.  That is the beginning of the end for the Wonders, as they start to disintegrate as a band - the guitar player (the goofball) is content to enjoy the ride, the bass player (the straightlaced one) runs off to the Marine Corps, while the Brooder knows that the only way to develop is to get in the studio and cut an album of all original songs.Holding the band together are the two central characters - Liv Tyler as the Brooder's girlfriend (and unofficial 5th member) and the drummer Guy.  Guy grew up destined to stay in his home town, inheriting the family business (selling appliances).  He sits in the basement at night with his beat-up drum kit and plays along with jazz records.  At one point, he asks a bellhop where he can find some ""good"" jazz, and when he passes a skill-testing question (""Who played cornet on so-and-so's album in 1956?"" Of course, Guy knows the answer), he is directed to a bar and ends up meeting one of his idols, a jazz pianist who is also in audience that night.The great thing about the film is that it is straightforward and earnest.  There are no artificial obstacles set in the band's way - Guy's father lets him go on tour without a second thought because he knows his son will never be happy as an appliance salesman.  When the band starts its inevitable meltdown, it's because of the personalities of the band members being true to their personalities, not because some greedy executive is taking advantage of them, or some other external reason.  We can therefore relax, knowing the plot isn't going to artificially jerk us around.  We can laugh along at the antics on the screen and we're happy at the end, even knowing intellectually that we haven't grown as human beings in the process.  The film is not perfect - the title song is overplayed like a catchy advertising jingle and you get a little sick of it.  But because the rest of the film is so fun, we can forgive such small problems.Comparisons with American Graffiti are inevitable.  Although they have different subjects, they both try to invoke the fun of a simpler time in the United States, that of the prosperous and morally simplistic 60's, before free love, anti-Vietnam protests, and race riots.  That Thing You Do! is sort of like American Graffiti lite, and it even includes a ""what happened to the main characters"" synopsis at the end.  It's a measure of the heart of the two films that the Bass Player becomes a marine and survives his tours of duty in Vietnam, whereas Terry in American Graffiti is killed in his tour.Unfortunately, I've deducted a star for the poor level of extras on the DVD.  There are a couple music videos (besically full-length versions of the songs), a making of short (which is a shameless extended-trailer promotional bit), and that's about it.  Tom Hanks is an interesting guy, and this is his directorial debut - why isn't there a director's commentary?",3,"A fun film, but a featureless DVD",1105833600,"01 16, 2005",2005,3481,"['charming', 'fun', 'all-ages', 'film', 'obvious', 'simply', 'listening', 'title', 'song', 'film', 'named', '1964', '4', 'pals', 'have', 'joined', 'together', 'form', 'band', 'Thee', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'instantly', 'recognisable', 'types', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'genuine', 'heartfelt', 'forgive', 'two-dimensionality', 'lead', 'singer', 'brooding', 'genius', 'written', 'catchy', 'tune', 'band', 'win', 'battle', 'bands', 'turn', 'gig', 'diner', 'turn', 'Well', 'get', 'idea', 'song', 'eventually', 'up', '7', 'Billboard', 'chart', 'beginning', 'end', 'Wonders', 'start', 'disintegrate', 'band', 'guitar', 'player', 'goofball', 'content', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'bass', 'player', 'straightlaced', 'one', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'Brooder', 'only', 'way', 'develop', 'get', 'studio', 'cut', 'album', 'original', 'songs.Holding', 'band', 'together', 'are', 'two', 'central', 'characters', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Brooder', 'girlfriend', 'unofficial', '5th', 'member', 'drummer', 'Guy', 'Guy', 'grew', 'up', 'destined', 'stay', 'home', 'town', 'inheriting', 'family', 'business', 'selling', 'appliances', 'basement', 'night', 'beat-up', 'drum', 'kit', 'plays', 'jazz', 'records', 'one', 'point', 'bellhop', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'good', 'jazz', 'when', 'skill-testing', 'question', 'Who', 'played', 'cornet', 'so-and-so', 'album', '1956', 'course', 'Guy', 'answer', 'directed', 'bar', 'up', 'meeting', 'one', 'idols', 'jazz', 'pianist', 'who', 'also', 'audience', 'great', 'thing', 'film', 'straightforward', 'earnest', 'are', 'artificial', 'obstacles', 'set', 'band', 'way', 'Guy', 'father', 'go', 'tour', 'second', 'thought', 'son', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'happy', 'appliance', 'salesman', 'When', 'band', 'inevitable', 'meltdown', 'personalities', 'band', 'members', 'being', 'true', 'personalities', 'not', 'greedy', 'executive', 'taking', 'advantage', 'other', 'external', 'reason', 'can', 'therefore', 'relax', 'knowing', 'plot', ""n't"", 'going', 'artificially', 'jerk', 'around', 'can', 'laugh', 'along', 'antics', 'screen', ""'re"", 'happy', 'end', 'even', 'knowing', 'intellectually', 'have', ""n't"", 'grown', 'human', 'beings', 'process', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'title', 'song', 'overplayed', 'catchy', 'advertising', 'jingle', 'get', 'little', 'sick', 'rest', 'film', 'so', 'fun', 'can', 'forgive', 'such', 'small', 'problems.Comparisons', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'are', 'inevitable', 'have', 'different', 'subjects', 'try', 'invoke', 'fun', 'simpler', 'time', 'United', 'States', 'prosperous', 'morally', 'simplistic', '60', 'free', 'love', 'anti-Vietnam', 'protests', 'race', 'riots', 'Thing', 'Do', 'sort', 'like', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'lite', 'even', 'happened', 'main', 'characters', 'synopsis', 'end', 'measure', 'heart', 'two', 'films', 'Bass', 'Player', 'marine', 'tours', 'duty', 'Vietnam', 'whereas', 'Terry', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'killed', 'tour.Unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'deducted', 'star', 'poor', 'level', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'couple', 'music', 'videos', 'besically', 'full-length', 'versions', 'songs', 'making', 'short', 'shameless', 'extended-trailer', 'promotional', 'bit', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'interesting', 'guy', 'directorial', 'debut', 'why', ""n't"", 'director', 'commentary']",That Thing You Do VHS

415684,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,6304342462,Cubist,"[4, 6]","That Thing You Do! is Tom Hanks' tribute to the slew of rock `n' roll bands that followed in the wake of the Beatles' phenomenal worldwide success. Record companies in the 1960s were desperate to find the American equivalent in the hopes of making the same kind of profit. The result was a lot of one hit wonder wannabes. Hanks' film (his directorial debut) is a fictionalized account about one of these bands. With this new DVD, he has revisited the film, adding 39 minutes of deleted scenes to it.For his directorial debut, Hanks wisely doesn't try to bite off more than he can chew. He keeps his ambitions modest and isn't too flashy with the camerawork. He understands that nothing should get in the way of the story or the characters. However, his script does show a lack of experience as little things, like a repeating gag of Guy proclaiming, ""I am Spartacus,"" wears thin very quickly. With this new extended cut he has provided too much of a good thing. The additional scenes pad out the running time to over two hours and what was once a tight, pop song has become a bloated power ballad. Fortunately, the perfectly fine theatrical cut is included as well.That Thing You Do! is an affectionate, nostalgic look back at simpler, more innocent times, just before the country became mired in the Vietnam War and the social and political climate changed radically and with it the music. Hanks recaptures a time when hundreds of screaming teenage girls would mob the bands that they worshipped, a time before the Internet so that music was promoted via the radio which had the power to make or break a band.There is the music video for ""Feel Alright"" that features a montage of clips from the movie.""The Wonders! Big in Japan!"" takes a look back at the promotional tour for the movie in Japan with footage of the actors goofing around at the time. The actors recount amusing anecdotes about their experiences. They even showed up to talk shows dressed in character performing ""That Thing You Do.""""The Story of The Wonders"" is a promo featurette done at the time of the film's original release. This is pretty standard fare with interview soundbites with Hanks and the cast with lots of clips from the movie.""Making That Thing You Do"" examine the creation of the movie and was done at the time of the film's release. From Hanks writing the screenplay to the finished product, this is much more substantial than the previous featurette and goes through the casting process and then takes a look at how the four lead actors learned how to actually play their instruments and act like a band.Easily the best extra is ""That Thing You Do!

415686,A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4,6304342462,Daniel Hurley,"[0, 0]","This is a great entertaining film of a small band from Erie Pennsylvania that picks up a classic blues drummer who alters the tempo of a ballad making it a hit pop tune. Great acting and humor by fresh faced actors by Scott, Schaech, Zahn, and Embry as the band and playing the sweet and innocent girlfriend is Liv Tyler. Of course Hanks pulls it all together as the band manager in his version of an American mid 60s version of the Beatles. The movie evolves with the song that is played often through out as the song evolves from a surprise hit in a small college contest to a cut that permeates the radio and plays constantly on tour with several great songs that fit the period well with entertaining songs by other bands and vocalists on tour. The film gives you all the fun and excitement of a youthful band climbing the charts with tension that seems to join success. Zahn keeps it loose with a sarcastic wit that keeps things light as the lead singer/writer emotes into a sulky driven artist looking to fulfill his own version of destiny.In contrast to the original DVD, the second disc includes several scenes that were cut that add to a less innocent side of the individual characters causing them to lose some of their freshness. Some of the scenes that were deleted include more adult relationships with their girlfriends and a more obvious portrayal of Hank's version of Brian Epstein along with a glimpse of his personal life. The darker cut is worthwhile to watch and an interesting contrast but the cuts not featured in the original demonstrate why it was the successful cut, it keeps the characters looking fresh and innocent making them attractive as the small band underdogs from Erie, Penn that make it big, with a real world ending.",5,Two Discs: Original versus the Uncut -  Warm & Innocent versus the Less Innocent,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,1753,"['great', 'entertaining', 'film', 'small', 'band', 'Erie', 'Pennsylvania', 'up', 'classic', 'blues', 'drummer', 'who', 'tempo', 'ballad', 'making', 'hit', 'pop', 'tune', 'Great', 'acting', 'humor', 'fresh', 'faced', 'actors', 'Scott', 'Schaech', 'Zahn', 'Embry', 'band', 'playing', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'girlfriend', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'course', 'Hanks', 'together', 'band', 'manager', 'version', 'American', 'mid', '60s', 'version', 'Beatles', 'movie', 'song', 'played', 'often', 'out', 'song', 'surprise', 'hit', 'small', 'college', 'contest', 'cut', 'radio', 'constantly', 'tour', 'several', 'great', 'songs', 'fit', 'period', 'well', 'entertaining', 'songs', 'other', 'bands', 'vocalists', 'tour', 'film', 'fun', 'excitement', 'youthful', 'band', 'climbing', 'charts', 'tension', 'join', 'success', 'Zahn', 'loose', 'sarcastic', 'wit', 'things', 'light', 'lead', 'singer/writer', 'sulky', 'driven', 'artist', 'looking', 'fulfill', 'own', 'version', 'destiny.In', 'contrast', 'original', 'DVD', 'second', 'disc', 'several', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'add', 'less', 'innocent', 'side', 'individual', 'characters', 'causing', 'lose', 'freshness', 'scenes', 'were', 'deleted', 'include', 'more', 'adult', 'relationships', 'girlfriends', 'more', 'obvious', 'portrayal', 'Hank', 'version', 'Brian', 'Epstein', 'glimpse', 'personal', 'life', 'darker', 'cut', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'cuts', 'not', 'featured', 'original', 'demonstrate', 'why', 'was', 'successful', 'cut', 'characters', 'looking', 'fresh', 'innocent', 'making', 'attractive', 'small', 'band', 'underdogs', 'Erie', 'Penn', 'make', 'big', 'real', 'world', 'ending']",That Thing You Do VHS

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","Alas, the musical landscape is dotted with them:  obscure groups--each sporting unique, often bizarre names--that burst onto the scene with a red-hot hit before fading into Billboard memory.THAT THING YOU DO! gives us the ambitious story of an eager garage band from 1964 Pennsylvania:  the enthusiastic One-ders (i.e. &quot;Wonders&quot;).  Long on talent but short on savvy, the band relies on a rather copious &quot;school of hard knocks&quot; as it attempts to break through via its signature song, &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot;  Subsequent misfires and setbacks are ultimately trumped by &quot;discovery&quot;--by a wily, seasoned manager from a major record label, the smirking Mr. White (Tom Hanks).  Thus the &quot;Wonders&quot; travel to southern California and start the clock on their fifteen minutes of fame:  a whirlwind of events that takes the band from the pinnacle to the slush pile in a mere manner of hours, as the Wonders implode from their own immature naivete.Tom Hanks is simply brilliant, both behind and in front of the camera.  The mostly unknown, ensemble cast--Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler (very well known now), Johnathon Schaech, Steve Zahn, Ethan Embry--fuels the story like a leg-twitching terrier looking for a fire hydrant.  This movie gets up and moves, both visually and audibly.

Hanks has shown for some time that he is the closest modern actor to the late, great Jimmy Stewart in the superb naturalness of his acting in every movie genre from comedies to drama. But with this film he shows himself also to be a talented writer and director as well. The movie chronicles the rise and dissolution of a 1960's rock band which writes and records a single top-ten hit. Personally I've always wondered why so many early rock groups were one-hit-wonders. If a band is good enough to make one hit record, why isn't it capable of making several -- or at least a few -- more? The answer presented in this movie is that the one-hit Wonders self detruct due to a combination of ego conflicts, the pressures of success, and just the vagaries of circumstance. This movie could have been a mildly entertaining quasi-documentary. Instead, as written and directed by Hanks and played by the talented young cast he assembled -- the most outstanding of whom is Tom Everett Scott and Liv Tyler (who recently played the beautiful elf Arwen in The Lord of the Rings) -- this is a fun film from beginning to end.

Moreover, the longer version has a few additional scenes that portray the Liv Tyler ""Faye"" character in an inconsistent unpleasant light.Moreover, not only are the extras on the second disc not particularly enjoyable, but inexplicably, despite having an additional disc, the two disc version leaves off the two performance videos extras -- the best extras -- from the original single disc version, adding a musical video of a song NOT performed by the Wonders.

Maybe it was partly the company, but I found the movie enjoyable but not outstanding.  In other words, I was disappointed. Maybe I was jaded, having just recently turned 40.  Maybe it seemed silly to someone at that stage of life.Then last winter, I caught just a bit of it on VH1, and it made me want to see it again.  I saw it recently at my local grocery store for ($) and picked it up.  Finally I had the chance to sit down and watch it in its entirety once again, and I cannot convey what an enjoyable experience it was!  It totally recaptured what, for me, was great about growing up in the '60s...that feeling that anything could happen, that your radio could explode with another classic any second, that, if you were a musician, you could be on the radio yourself if you got a band together and wrote a good song.  Well, I was just a kid then, but I believed.This movie was obviously a labor of love for Tom Hanks - his attention to period detail is amazing.  He puts you right in the middle of the early summer of '64 in every way.  His soundtrack is just superb.  Rather than use actual songs from that time period, he creates, with help from other songwriters, his own pastiche of the sounds of '64, with splendid and amusing results.The movie bounced off of me the first time I saw it...and I'm not quite sure why.  All the performances are sterling, and there is really so much to appreciate...the song (That Thing You Do) getting better and better as they gain popularity, the acquisition of 'professional instruments' as they go on tour; most of all, the pure joy that is conveyed the first time they hear their song on the radio.  That moment, that magic moment, is conveyed with incredible excitement.  You feel like you are inside the characters as they react to the giddy shock of hearing their song on the airwaves.Like reality, the giddyness is bound to end and reality set in; hence the last third of the movie is a sober affair.  It was a letdown when I saw it the first time, but now it is a brilliant resolution and, really, very believable.  Here was a group with no foundation, no history, just a lucky happenstance.  It simply couldn't last.  The end was believable and, really, happy.The performances and direction are subtle.  The movie gets better with each subsequent viewing.

It's funny but also typically American. There are so many sharks going around looking for young teenage would-be rock stars that it is impossible not to be noticed by one, one day, not to become some one overnight and not to dissolved as soon as the top is reached. To stay at the top is really difficult. A band in those days, and in the USA, was the normal way for anyone who wanted to do some music on the stage to go around but bands did not last long. Everyone is not the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, you know. This is the story of the short-lived Wonders and yet the four boys and the one girl who were there at the first public appearance in the boonies, all eventually did something with their skin and their brains, if they had any, both skin and brains. Today that adventure still exists in the USA but it has also taken names like Myspace music, Youtube, Daily Motion and some others. Permanence of course is nothing in that business in 99% of the cases, but chance is also essential for those who have something in their veins. A career is often 50% talent and 50% chance, some would say opportunity. But the film is funny, though so banal that it should be a warning to anyone who wants to imitate these young teenagers. As the old Paxton would say: look after your money, women and a few other things of that type.

415717,A3CWEK9HY2VPDL,6304342462,J. Green,"[7, 8]","The story of an Erie, PA garage band in 1964 who scores a big hit when they replace their drummer (who breaks his arm goofing around) with another friend.  Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) works in his family's appliance store and loves Jazz music, but he fills in during a talent show and changes the beat from a slow ballad to a dance-able tune and starts a chain reaction.  They record the song and get picked up by a talent scout and later a ""record label"" and end up in Hollywood with a top-ten Billboard hit.  Along the way they change their name from the ""One-ders"" (which everyone is constantly mispronouncing) to the ""Wonders"" and eventually have a melt-down as personalties clash and they drift in separate directions.  They end up as just another ""one-hit wonder"" but the trip is fun as you share in their excitement.  I especially liked the scene at the talent show and later when their song is first played on the radio.Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't get tired of the hit song ""That Thing You Do"" or the other songs they play.  The other bands and their music are so true to the era that I was surprised to learn that none of the music in the film is from actual singers or bands, but all are entirely fictional.  I especially liked ""Time to Blow,"" the song Guy plays with the fictional Del Paxton (and if anyone can point me to similar music, ie. piano and drums jazz w/o horns, I'd appreciate it).  In fact, I liked the music so much that I bought the soundtrack and still enjoy listening to it.  Although it's all a bit before my time, it all looks and sounds like authentic early 60's.  And the other actors (Tom Hanks, Liv Tyler, Steve Zahn, Johnathon Schaech, and Ethan Embry who is known simply as the Bass Player) are all great and from what I've seen on VH1 all learned to look like they were actually playing the right notes and chords.  Overall, a great clean movie that I love to put on every once in a while.  I think it was a shame that it didn't do better when it was in the theaters.",5,"Great movie, great music, and very under-rated",1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,2020,"['story', 'Erie', 'PA', 'garage', 'band', '1964', 'who', 'big', 'hit', 'when', 'replace', 'drummer', 'who', 'arm', 'goofing', 'friend', 'Guy', 'Patterson', 'Tom', 'Everett', 'Scott', 'family', 'appliance', 'store', 'Jazz', 'music', 'talent', 'show', 'beat', 'slow', 'ballad', 'dance-able', 'tune', 'chain', 'reaction', 'record', 'song', 'get', 'picked', 'up', 'talent', 'scout', 'later', 'record', 'label', 'end', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'top-ten', 'Billboard', 'hit', 'way', 'change', 'name', 'One-ders', 'everyone', 'constantly', 'mispronouncing', 'Wonders', 'eventually', 'have', 'melt-down', 'personalties', 'clash', 'drift', 'separate', 'directions', 'end', 'up', 'as', 'just', 'one-hit', 'wonder', 'trip', 'fun', 'share', 'excitement', 'especially', 'liked', 'scene', 'talent', 'show', 'later', 'when', 'song', 'first', 'played', 'radio.Unlike', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'tired', 'hit', 'song', 'Thing', 'Do', 'other', 'songs', 'play', 'other', 'bands', 'music', 'are', 'so', 'true', 'era', 'was', 'surprised', 'learn', 'none', 'music', 'film', 'actual', 'singers', 'bands', 'are', 'entirely', 'fictional', 'especially', 'liked', 'Time', 'Blow', 'song', 'Guy', 'fictional', 'Del', 'Paxton', 'anyone', 'can', 'point', 'similar', 'music', 'ie', 'piano', 'drums', 'jazz', 'w/o', 'horns', ""'d"", 'appreciate', 'fact', 'liked', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'still', 'enjoy', 'listening', 'bit', 'time', 'looks', 'sounds', 'authentic', 'early', '60', 'other', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Johnathon', 'Schaech', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'who', 'known', 'simply', 'Bass', 'Player', 'are', 'great', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'VH1', 'learned', 'look', 'were', 'actually', 'playing', 'right', 'notes', 'chords', 'Overall', 'great', 'clean', 'movie', 'love', 'put', 'once', 'while', 'think', 'was', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'when', 'was', 'theaters']",That Thing You Do VHS

From the start with the frustrations of relationships within a neighborhood rock and roll band, to the development into a number one hit, this movie takes you on the ride from small Erie, PA across the country to Hollywood.Hanks does a tremendous job bringing together some unknowns to develop a great idea.  This band, the Oneders - then the Wonders - goes through changes and the movie seems to be like the life of both the early Beatles and the Monkees combined.  There is a 60s quality to the movie that gives it a very pleasant charm.  Innocence is really shown in the movie, then characters develop and become a little more experienced in life.The life of the bands working on a cross country trip as part of a record label as they track their meteoric rise to the top is especially interesting.There is one scene in the movie that actually can give you the chills, you really get a kick out of the joy the band feels as Liv Tyler and friends run down a busy Erie street, probably State Street, screaming and yelling and jumping up and down when their new song has hit the airwaves for the first time.  If there was ever a scene showing immense joy, this is possibly it.Well casted, well produced, the movie is a fun romp through the development of a Wonder.  The extras in the DVD are fun as well.

415723,A1WX6R3Q4U37DQ,6304342462,"Joseph Morris ""Joe Morris""","[4, 4]","Man I love this film.Its the story of the Wonders - thoroughly entertaining and (yes) movingThe Tom Hanks extended (by a half hour!) cut..I've always been fond of this film. The music is great (the soundtrack cd is especially wonderful - even the tracks by Tom Hanks himself like ""Love you lots and lots"" - though good luck finding the songbook!)There are wonderful lines (""I...quit. I quit. I quit I quit I quit. I quit Mr White."") Theres a touching love story..Watching the extended cut again, I'm reminded of the recent Tolkien films, where they added so much footage in so seamlessly, and it added a lot to the point that you would never watch the theatrical cut ever again (unless you had to be somewhere by a certain time and couldn't afford the longer time!)I like the added time given to Guy Stevens and Faye (Liv Tyler)'s relationship. I can see why some stuff was left out of the theatrical cut - its fun to see Tom Hank's Mr White character bickering with his date, but its not essential.But if you love this film (it IS a very likable film - even Hanks wife and son have cameos) you really have to get this then.I like how Guy gets along with his dad, theres a good relationship with his family at work (I like how they don't pay the sister!) Its not cliched - these are just regular kids from Erie Pennsylvania who happen upon a hit song, pretty much by accident..Theres a strong American Graffiti influence (the end credits tell what happened to the Wonders after) and theres also little nods to Spinal Taps (the Wonders play while aircrafts pass overhead).Did I mention the music? Yes I have. Dude from the Fountains of Wayne (an actual place in Wayne NJ!) wrote the catchier songsAnd thank God they're GOOD catchy songs, cos ""That thing you do"" is played ad nauseum throughout the film, as the group promote it while on tour (often playing no other number!) and then on tv.Keep an eye out for Peter Scolari (of Bosom Buddies, and friend to Hanks) as the MC on that. Jonathan Demme has a cameo as (what else) a director. White flirts with him btwIts not a dark film by any means, which is why I like it so much I bet. No rock screw ups in this, who drive themselves and everyone around them to ruin. The worst you get is an egotistical songwriter in the group who rubs everyone else the wrong way.The dvd extras - well, they're wonderful: interviews with the cast, talking about the film (apparently a lot of kissing in the scene with Cherlize Theron). Heck, you can even play the That Thing You Do single at 78 rpm if you so choose (just click on the speed knob on the title menu while the dvd is loading!)Again - the deleted scenes DO add a lot to the film. I was watching the deleted scenes for Tootsie recently (4-5 of them all told) and I watched them once, never peered at them again (and I've seen Tootsie at least 20, 25 times all told - even owned the video pre-dvd and watched it on laserdisc besides)But I tend to watch the extended cut for TTYD. I like how it fleshes out the story more. You see more of Guy talking with his hero Del Paxton, and doing interviews with him and his musical cronies. Which is great.Nice little scenes - you see the sweet T.B. Player (The Bass Player) hooking up with one of the Tritone singers on tourAlso - I didn't pick up on this first time I saw this film - Tom Hanks is probably the only character besides Guy who cares for Faye. Hanks got a good role here - he has fun with it, you can see hes having a good time; gets a kick from the music. His manager character is an outsider (he tends to be standoffish with the Wonders, although he cares for them and genuinely likes them). But you can tell hes having fun - hes doing what he wants to do, even if hes not given the credit (a great added scene where the head of Tritone takes credit for the Wonders - Guy asks him about it, and White just says ""Never mind. Did you like Texas?"")So this could be one of the better roles Tom Hank has ever had. His first film role at age 29 (in He Knows You're Alone) was just a cameo where he was a student, basically commenting on the film itself; here hes having a good time - doesn't really let his guard down, but lets it loose when he wants (theres a great shot of him at one of the Wonders live performances of ""Dance with me tonight"" and hes completely internalized but thoroughly enjoying the performance)And Shades! Guy Patterson's shades make you think back on all the ridiculous gimmicks people in bands have done to stand out. You got the Beatles having the long hair, the Byrds Roger McGuinn wearing different colored shaded glasses, Lennon doing the whole granny glasses bit, Love's Arthur Lee walking around with one shoe.. Groups really are marketed, and the drummer has a whole set of shades he to wear AT ALL TIMES! To make him ""dangerous"" - great stuff.Very highly recommended film, theatrical OR extended. Very entertaining, especially if you're nostalgic for the 60s (and after all who isn't?) The period background is totally believable, what with the old models of tvs and radios, especially in the Paterson's Appliance store!

415724,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,6304342462,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[3, 3]","With the added length of this new director's cut, the fun, bouncy ""That Thing You Do!"" is now the fun, bouncy, semi-epic ""That Thing You Do!""  But that's okay... if the film plays a little long now, it IS on DVD and you can always take a break and stretch a bit before resuming the fun.For what it's worth, I enjoyed the added scenes.  You get more details related to the rise of ""The Wonders"" and more details once the group really hits its stride and does TV, movies, and packed-house concerts.  The added Charlize Theron/dentist scenes are also amusing, and happily don't overwhelm the film because there aren't all that many of them and they aren't drawn out.More importantly, this new cut makes the conclusion of the movie work a little better.  I always thought that the break up of ""The Wonders"" pretty much came out of left field, as if the producers said to themselves, ""well, the movie's about to end, so we gotta break them up to keep the whole one-hit wonder thing in place.""  Now, there are a few subtle pieces of set-up throughout the movie, showing that lead singer Jimmy isn't always the easist person to get along with and maybe has a bit of an ego problem.  So, now, when the dressing room scene comes along where Jimmy is annoyed with the group and his girlfriend and generally pretty much everything else around him, and quits the group, it no longer feels like it's coming out of nowhere.  The scene wasn't fatal to the movie before- as sometimes things DO come out of nowhere- but the scene works much better now.The extended cut also doesn't interfere with the well-done flavor of the film's closing moments in general.  There was always a nice balance between the characters saying to themselves ""yeah, it's sad that the group is breaking up"" and the more upbeat ""well, we knew deep down it wouldn't last forever, so let's just be happy about the really great ride we had"".

415727,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,6304342462,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[1, 1]","After a movie star hits it big, really big, they usually get the chance to bring a pet project to fruition. Bruce Willis brought out what he thought was a well thought out project in &#8220;Hudson Hawk&#8221; which garnered reviews as possibly one of the worst movies in film history. John Travolta, after his career resurgence in the mid-90&#8217;s, brought us &#8220;Battlefield Earth&#8221; which replaced &#8220;Hudson Hawk&#8221; as a contender for the worst film in movie history. Tom Hanks on the heels of his success in &#8220;A League of Their Own,&#8221; &#8220;Philadelphia,&#8221; &#8220;Sleepless in Seattle,&#8221; &#8220;Forrest Gump,&#8221; &#8220;Apollo 13,&#8221; and even &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; brought us &#8220;That Thing You Do!&#8221; is an example of personal filmmaking at it&#8217;s best.&#8220;That Thing You Do!&#8221;, which was written and directed by Hanks and he plays a supporting role in the film, is the story of small town rock band in 1964, which through a series of accidents and coincidences suddenly finds itself with a hit record, on a rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll tour, and on the fast track to Los Angeles for a major label. The movie captures the sense of innocence and naivet&eacute;  of the characters as they get carried along this stream, but it also captures the fun and excitement of the moment. The scene when they&#8217;re walking down the main street listening to transistor radios and they hear their song on the radio for the very first time! has a palpable sense of excitement and joy in the moment. I can&#8217;t remember another movie that has captured that so well.The movie is well acted, Tom Everett-Scott plays the focal character of the film, Guy Patterson, &#8220;Erie&#8217;s one beatnik&#8221; who is asked to sit in for The Oneders (pronounced wonders) drummer and whose input changes the destiny of the band. Johnathon Schaech plays Jimmy Mattingly the serious, talented and ambitious leader of the band who has penned the song that will take them to the top, &#8216;That Thing You Do!&#8217;. Steve Zahn plays the goofy lead guitar player who is in the band for the girls, and Ethan Embry plays the bass player (who never gets a name in the movie except to be called &#8216;the bass player&#8217;) who is just going along for the ride and is more interested in joining the Marines than being in a rock band. Liv Tyler plays Faye, Jimmy&#8217;s girlfriend and mascot of the band. Hanks himself plays Mr. White, the Play-Tone A&R; man guiding the band along it&#8217;s path of rock touring and recording. Although, these roles seem like they&#8217;re clich&eacute;s none is played as a clich&eacute; and that gives each character a freshness, likeability and room for character development present even in the unnamed character of &#8216;the bass player.&#8217; A special mention should be made to Obba Babatunde as Lamar, the bellman at the Los Angeles hotel the (renamed) Wonders are staying at, again this could be a stock character played as a clich&eacute; but Lamar is given life and a vibrance by Babatunde.The bonus features on the &#8216;Tom Hanks Extended Cut&#8217; include a music video for &#8220;Feel Alright,&#8221; &#8220;The Wonders Big in Japan,&#8221; &#8220;The Making of That Thing You Do!&#8221; &#8220;The Story of the Wonders.&#8221; &#8220;Reunion; The Wonders,&#8221; and &#8220;HBO First Look: That Thing You Do!&#8221;  All are interesting and give some great background on how Hanks came up with the idea for the movie and his bringing it to the screen. The only shortcoming is the HBO First Look featurette is pretty redundant of &#8220;The Making of&#8221; featurette, one of them could have been left off.This is a movie you&#8217;ll want to see and the DVD you want to have!",5,Personal Filmmaking at it's Best!,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,3772,"['movie', 'star', 'big', 'really', 'big', 'usually', 'get', 'chance', 'bring', 'pet', 'project', 'fruition', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'brought', 'out', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'project', '8220', 'Hudson', 'Hawk', '8221', 'garnered', 'reviews', 'possibly', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'film', 'history', 'John', 'Travolta', 'career', 'resurgence', 'mid-90', '8217', 's', 'brought', '8220', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', '8221', 'replaced', '8220', 'Hudson', 'Hawk', '8221', 'contender', 'worst', 'film', 'movie', 'history', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'heels', 'success', '8220', 'A', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', '8221', '8220', 'Philadelphia', '8221', '8220', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', '8221', '8220', 'Forrest', 'Gump', '8221', '8220', 'Apollo', '13', '8221', 'even', '8220', 'Toy', 'Story', '8221', 'brought', '8220', 'Thing', 'Do', '8221', 'example', 'personal', 'filmmaking', '8217', 'best.', '8220', 'Thing', 'Do', '8221', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Hanks', 'supporting', 'role', 'film', 'story', 'small', 'town', 'rock', 'band', '1964', 'series', 'accidents', 'coincidences', 'suddenly', 'hit', 'record', 'rock', '8216', '8217', 'roll', 'tour', 'fast', 'track', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'major', 'label', 'movie', 'sense', 'innocence', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'characters', 'get', 'carried', 'stream', 'also', 'fun', 'excitement', 'moment', 'scene', 'when', '8217', 're', 'walking', 'down', 'main', 'street', 'listening', 'transistor', 'radios', 'hear', 'song', 'radio', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'palpable', 'sense', 'excitement', 'joy', 'moment', 'can', '8217', 'remember', 'movie', 'captured', 'so', 'well.The', 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'Tom', 'Everett-Scott', 'focal', 'character', 'film', 'Guy', 'Patterson', '8220', 'Erie', '8217', 'one', 'beatnik', '8221', 'who', 'asked', 'sit', 'Oneders', 'pronounced', 'wonders', 'drummer', 'input', 'destiny', 'band', 'Johnathon', 'Schaech', 'Jimmy', 'Mattingly', 'serious', 'talented', 'ambitious', 'leader', 'band', 'who', 'penned', 'song', 'will', 'take', 'top', '8216', 'Thing', 'Do', '8217', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'goofy', 'lead', 'guitar', 'player', 'who', 'band', 'girls', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'bass', 'player', 'who', 'never', 'name', 'movie', 'be', 'called', '8216', 'bass', 'player', '8217', 'who', 'just', 'going', 'along', 'ride', 'more', 'interested', 'joining', 'Marines', 'being', 'rock', 'band', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Faye', 'Jimmy', '8217', 'girlfriend', 'mascot', 'band', 'Mr.', 'White', 'Play-Tone', 'A', 'R', 'man', 'guiding', 'band', '8217', 's', 'path', 'rock', 'touring', 'recording', 'roles', 'seem', '8217', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'none', 'played', 'clich', 'eacute', 'character', 'freshness', 'likeability', 'room', 'character', 'development', 'present', 'even', 'unnamed', 'character', '8216', 'bass', 'player.', '8217', 'special', 'mention', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'Obba', 'Babatunde', 'Lamar', 'bellman', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'hotel', 'renamed', 'Wonders', 'are', 'staying', 'again', 'could', 'be', 'stock', 'character', 'played', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Lamar', 'given', 'life', 'vibrance', 'Babatunde.The', 'bonus', 'features', '8216', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Extended', 'Cut', '8217', 'include', 'music', 'video', '8220', 'Feel', 'Alright', '8221', '8220', 'Wonders', 'Big', 'Japan', '8221', '8220', 'Making', 'Thing', 'Do', '8221', '8220', 'Story', 'Wonders.', '8221', '8220', 'Reunion', 'Wonders', '8221', '8220', 'HBO', 'First', 'Look', 'Thing', 'Do', '8221', 'are', 'interesting', 'give', 'great', 'background', 'how', 'Hanks', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'movie', 'bringing', 'screen', 'only', 'shortcoming', 'HBO', 'First', 'Look', 'featurette', 'pretty', 'redundant', '8220', 'Making', '8221', 'featurette', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'off.This', 'movie', '8217', 'want', 'see', 'DVD', 'want', 'have']",That Thing You Do VHS

Well, I watched it and you know what, I didn't find the expanded version so great.  We do get more of Charlize Theron's character.  But she's awful even at full length (I mean the character, not the delightful actress who plays her), and the emphasis on her back story comes, to me, at the expense of Liv Tyler's character and she's supposed to be the heroine!  Why don't we know as much about Tyler as we do about Theron--her family, the other guys in her life, her dreams and hopes?  Other reviewers keep calling her the unofficial fifth member of the band, but in the film itself it's only Guy Patteron who accords her this status, and she seems resigned to being a nothing.  She doesn't even try.  In a way, her resignation is appropriate for the period of the film, in which few women )especially those without musical talent) muscled their way into rock groups.  But otherwise it was just like, if Faye didn't land Jimmy, and you can tell from frame one that she won't, then it's up to Guy to make an honest woman out of her.The movie has a bad case of the Kindly Black Stranger syndrome, doesn't it, just like every other Tom Hanks film.  That's when black people show up on screen but only to provude the clueless white hero with some direction in life.  It happens to our boy Guy Patterson not once but twice.  First he idolizes the fictional Ray Charles like piano player idol Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs, from THE ULTIMATE GIFT), and then he meets his idol who changes his life.  Then he meets a helpful black doorman at the Ambassador Hotel (Obba Babbatunde, playing ""Lamarr"") who sends up the helpful black stranger thing with his unbelievably bad acting--I think it was just plain refusal to play his bad scenes as written.  I won't spoil the movie for you by telling you his function in it.Meanwhile, I kept thinking (after seeing BOBBY, the movie about Bobby Kennedy's last day of life) that this film must have really influenced Emilio Estevez and the other people who made BOBBY!  They seem to have imported every hotel character in THAT THING YOU DO and just brought them over wholesale directly into BOBBY!  Check out the beauty parlor scene in both films--and then ask yourself which movie has Sharon Stone as the fading, rueful beautician?  You can't remember, because they're the same movie!  I figure that the Lamarr character later ages and becomes the Harry Belafonte character in BOBBY, while the hotel cafe where the romantic action takes place in THAT THING YOU DO is, of course, the tragic mise en scene of BOBBY!

There were undoubtedly good reasons to leave some celluloid on the cutting room floor in the first place.The additional scenes on this DVD not only do not add much to the original, they actually detract from it. The tight pacing of the shorter version is interrupted. SOme of the scenes introduce an element of sexuality into the film that takes away from one of the chief charms of the original. This was a movie that, on paper, should have been a flop because it was too tame. No sex, no drugs, no cursing. Yet it was embraced by mature movie-going audiences. Scenes involving Guy and Tina, The Bass Player and the Chantrelline, and --- above all -- Mr. White and ""Lloyd"", go a long way towards making this movie like all the others. And the movie is good precisely because it's not like all the others.

415741,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,6304342462,Marty Gillis,"[6, 6]","I have waited quite a while for 'That Thing You Do!' to be released in high definition.  My 2 disc DVD collectors set had very nice picture quality and included a very large amount of extras so it was safe to assume (so I thought) the BD release would greatly up the ante for both picture and sound.Well, I got half of it right....  The sound has been greatly enhanced with a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  If only the picture quality could have enjoyed the same bump in quality.  Right off, I would give the overall audio presentation a solid 4 to 4.5 out of 5 and since this film revolves around music that is a very good thing!As it stands, this Blu Ray has proven to be a major disappointment in the video area. Yes it mostly looks better than the DVD  but in many cases it actually looks WORSE. How can that be you ask? Your answer is as good as mine but there a MANY scenes that display a murky out-of-focus quality that just didn't exist on the NTSC DVD release.  While colors (for the most part) are strong, skin tones fluctuate and vary greatly during the film and there are MANY instances of actual ""color smearing"" that are not noise reduction related.Print damage is minimal and mostly stable. Edge enhancement and some aliasing is evident from time to time and there are a few horrendous issues with black crush. At times this transfer looks like a million bucks, other times it plumbs the depths of the 99 cents store.Mind you, the average viewer will most likely find this release to be fine, even desirable.  Compared to the Blu Ray release of , say , 'The Blues Brothers' this film loses the PQ challenge and other titles including 'Ghostbusters' and 'Beverly Hills Cop' also best 'That Thing You Do!'  It IS , however, better than the original 'Arthur' and especially better than '48 Hours' which for my personal collection holds the current title of my worst catalog transfer.ALL the extras seem to have been ported over from the 2-disc DVD release and they are plentiful but presented in SD.. For those that care, this BD is housed in another el-cheapo Eco case (I HATE them) and I find the artwork plus the menu system on the DVD set to be superior to what is on offer here.I still give this product 5 stars and the reasons are very simple.  First, this is IT as far as getting 'That Thing You Do!' on HD and for the foreseeable future AND the audio is greatly improved which ALMOST makes up for the very (at times) lackluster picture quality of this release.  If you already own the DVD set, you most likely know this film inside and out and will notice most all of the same things I have pointed out in this review on the new Blu Ray. I can definitely say THIS Blu Ray release will best broadcasts on your HD premium channels  with better sound and a richer looking image.If only this film had been carefully remastered for this release.  There is just NO WAY Mr. Tom Hanks shot a film that projected this way in the theater. Nope, something went wrong between the negatives and this shiny disc and the only possible explanation I can give is PERHAPS this was sourced from a preexisting HDTV master and just punched up a bit.  If not, then I would love to hear the excuse from those responsible.  For me, another disappointing BD, but I still must give it a full 5 star rating as a wonderfully re-watchable and original film that will strike just the right chord with Boomers.

The drama is barely there, the plot is predictably simple, and the soundtrack is dominated by the nigh-endless repetition of the titular song. But, to me at least, it is, and I've probably put it into the vcr at bedtime about two dozen times over the last few years. The movie is as catchy as the song; there are a series of mildly amusing moments that just make the scenes fun to watch. Somehow Hanks conveys the giddiness the young band experiences as they rise to stardom, and we wish them all well. We want Liv and Guy to get together, and their flirtations are full of sweetness and genuine warmth.

415744,A18IPB2PPWUZCI,6304342462,Max Fabien,"[0, 0]","&#34;That Thing You Do&#34; has been one of my favorite films from its initial theatrical release in 1996. Tom Hanks does an excellent job in getting the essence of the period. But now, after purchasing the blue ray disc, and viewing the extended director's cut, I'm amazed at how even better the film is. So much of the storyline was left out originally. In the extended version Charlize Theron's part is greatly enhanced. Her relationship with Thomas Everett Scott is delved into more deeply. Also, she gets involved with another character that is totally missing from the theatrical release. And there is another relationship that is also totally missing from the original. It involves Tom Hanks. I won't reveal fully what it is. I'll just say, notice in the film he is not wearing a wedding ring.  The title tune is so catchy, I never got tired of hearing it. It should've won the Oscar for &#34;Best Song&#34; that year because it was the embodiment of the film. It was its own character, essential to the story. As for the Blue Ray transfer, others have criticized the below par quality I generally disagree. I thought the picture was as sharp as most other Blue Ray discs, with the exception of one scene toward the end of the film that appears not as sharp and clear. It is when Guy and Faye are talking in the coffee shop. It's as if that scene in the film got skipped when being processed. But to me it's a minor flaw that does not take away from the sheer enjoyment. And the Blue Ray soundtrack is superb. When the band is playing to the audiences, the surround sound is so vivid, you are there in the middle of the crowd, keeping the beat, and sharing in the excitement and wonder of the Wonders. A gentle caution to parents of very young children: The extended version does have a few scenes not in the theatrical release that are a little suggestive, that might be given a PG-13 rating.",5,"Excellent movie when originally released, EXTENDED version even BETTER!",1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,1900,"['34', 'Thing', 'Do', '34', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'initial', 'theatrical', 'release', '1996', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'excellent', 'job', 'getting', 'essence', 'period', 'now', 'purchasing', 'blue', 'ray', 'disc', 'viewing', 'extended', 'director', 'cut', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'how', 'even', 'better', 'film', 'So', 'much', 'storyline', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'originally', 'extended', 'version', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'part', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'relationship', 'Thomas', 'Everett', 'Scott', 'delved', 'more', 'deeply', 'Also', 'involved', 'character', 'totally', 'missing', 'theatrical', 'release', 'relationship', 'also', 'totally', 'missing', 'original', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'fully', 'what', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'notice', 'film', 'not', 'wearing', 'wedding', 'ring', 'title', 'tune', 'so', 'catchy', 'never', 'got', 'tired', 'hearing', 'should', ""'ve"", 'won', 'Oscar', '34', 'Best', 'Song', '34', 'year', 'was', 'embodiment', 'film', 'was', 'own', 'character', 'essential', 'story', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'transfer', 'others', 'have', 'criticized', 'below', 'par', 'quality', 'generally', 'disagree', 'thought', 'picture', 'was', 'as', 'sharp', 'most', 'other', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'discs', 'exception', 'one', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'sharp', 'clear', 'when', 'Guy', 'Faye', 'are', 'talking', 'coffee', 'shop', 'scene', 'film', 'got', 'skipped', 'when', 'being', 'processed', 'minor', 'flaw', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'sheer', 'enjoyment', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'soundtrack', 'superb', 'When', 'band', 'playing', 'audiences', 'surround', 'sound', 'so', 'vivid', 'are', 'there', 'middle', 'crowd', 'keeping', 'beat', 'sharing', 'excitement', 'wonder', 'Wonders', 'gentle', 'caution', 'parents', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'extended', 'version', 'have', 'few', 'scenes', 'not', 'theatrical', 'release', 'are', 'little', 'suggestive', 'might', 'be', 'given', 'PG-13', 'rating']",That Thing You Do VHS

415748,A12DP14GPRZF7E,6304342462,M. E. Volmar,"[64, 68]","This is a delightful movie, probably unlike any you've ever seen. All the characters are so well balanced and adorable, and their story is so well told that it makes you feel it's a true story about real people. It's refreshing, sweet, entertaining and charming.A group of friends puts together a music band and they record a song. The song gets on the radio and quickly climbs the music charts, making them an overnight success. Their unexpected and speedily growing fame puts their relationships, as well as individual integrity and self-respect, to the test. Troubles arise, and with them the characters show their true natures, good and bad, making their musical career as a rock group as brief and ephemeral as lightning.But despite the obstacles the characters face, a few good things derive from them, new relationships are formed, old ones are strengthened, and all the characters make the choices that allow them to successfully follow their dreams after having lived through a life-changing, once-in-a-lifetime experience.The score of the film is great and the songs are true to the style and the music of the sixties, which is the period in which the movie takes place. The clothing and sets are accurate and the characters are wonderfully adapted to the fads of the time. The writing, plot and dialogues are superbly well done (by Tom Hanks) and makes each and every character come alive, even those with just a few minutes of screen time. The cast is exquisitely chosen, including Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler and Tom Hanks, and their performances are natural and enjoyable.This movie is a delight to watch time and again; each time you'll discover new details from the richly layered, yet realistic and simple personality of each character.

He weans them along slowly while the lead singer thinks it is too slow.  As their popularity grows (and they take the name The Wonders), the lead singer's patience wanes and he feels too big for his girlfriend (Liv Tyler), who has stood by him through the band's struggles to get to the top.  As he pushes her away, she drifts more towards the band's drummer, who seems to be the most caring of the group.The movie has an amazing scene where the drummer goes to a ""jazz"" club and meets his all time idol, who turns out to be a regular guy and not the prima donna that the Wonders' lead singer is.Though the groups and the songs were made for the movie, they all sound like they could have been made in the 60's and would have been definate hits!I am surprised that this movie was not a mega-hit because it is really that good.",5,Excellent!,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,1051,"['Tom', 'Hanks', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'time', 'band', 'manager', 'fictional', 'record', 'company.A', 'group', 'small', 'town', 'teens', 'Erie', 'Pennsylvania', 'have', 'amazing', 'sound', 'catchy', 'song', 'Hanks', 'attention', 'along', 'slowly', 'lead', 'singer', 'too', 'slow', 'popularity', 'grows', 'take', 'name', 'Wonders', 'lead', 'singer', 'patience', 'wanes', 'too', 'big', 'girlfriend', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'who', 'stood', 'band', 'struggles', 'get', 'top', 'away', 'more', 'band', 'drummer', 'who', 'be', 'most', 'caring', 'group.The', 'movie', 'amazing', 'scene', 'where', 'drummer', 'jazz', 'club', 'time', 'idol', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'regular', 'guy', 'not', 'prima', 'donna', 'Wonders', 'lead', 'singer', 'groups', 'songs', 'were', 'made', 'movie', 'sound', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', '60', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'definate', 'hits', 'am', 'surprised', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'mega-hit', 'really', 'good']",That Thing You Do VHS

415753,A25LP5X4SEZ7NT,6304342462,Mike in Elmhurst,"[149, 152]","Last week, I saw ""That Thing You Do!"" on one of the cable movie channels. I had not seen it for a while and had a couple of hours staring me down, so I sat back and watched it. The film itself is a nice piece of work by Mr. Hanks. He did himself proud. And that song! What a catchy, get-under-your-skin-in-your-brain pop tune!Then, two days later, I was in Best Buy (humming That Thing You Do, by the way) and this new edition DVD appears before me unexpectedly, on sale. Without thinking, I bought it, took it home and I have watched it three times since (the theatrical release, once and the extended version, twice) and I will watch many times more.This new release of That Thing You Do! underscores why ""The Director's Cut"" genre in DVD releases has become so invaluable to film aficionados like myself.The theatrical version is priceless (still), but the ""Director's Cut"" is incredible and a major revelation. So many gaps in the plot have been filled in (gaps that I wasn't even aware of, so well put-together was the original version). This newer version has made the film a mini-masterpiece.As in the original, the cast is excellent, the plot is believable and charming, the performances are funny, vibrant, true-to-life, and in this version, quite poignant.Charlize Theron's character, Tina, and her relationship with Guy, in particular, suddenly become crucial elements to the early plot development (she is a minor character in the original version). Her character is fleshed-out, and she has one HYSTERICAL scene (in the dentist's chair) that caught me so off-guard with its humour, that I nearly choked to death with laughter!!Even Tom Hanks character as the group's manager, Mr. White, becomes more developed and there is an interesting scene and dialogue when the group is in Los Angeles at ""the same hotel Lucy and Ricky stayed at"" between Guy (who is gently drunk), Mr. White and a guy named Lloyd.Even The Bass Player (the Wonder's bass player who is never given a name), played by the adorable Ethan Embry, has a scene or two not in the original film that adds to the sweetness of his character (as well as some sly sexiness).Liv Tyler's role as Jimmy's girlfriend, Faye, becomes even more developed and she is such a marvelous actress in this film. She really is the heart and soul of the movie, and the newer version only adds to her wonderful mystique in this film.And of course, Steve Zahn as Lenny, is still as funny as ever and is the one band member who has no fear to ""push the envelope"" and ride the roller-coaster of success to wherever it takes them.I recommend this new version of ""That Thing You Do!"" whole-heartedly. Whether it is the original or the extended-cut, it is a lively, spirited, upbeat and thoroughly delightful viewing experience.And, I am STILL humming ""That Thing You Do!""",5,A Mini-Masterpiece,1186272000,"08 5, 2007",2007,2820,"['Last', 'week', 'saw', 'Thing', 'Do', 'one', 'cable', 'movie', 'channels', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'while', 'had', 'couple', 'hours', 'staring', 'down', 'sat', 'back', 'watched', 'film', 'nice', 'piece', 'work', 'Mr.', 'Hanks', 'did', 'proud', 'song', 'What', 'catchy', 'get-under-your-skin-in-your-brain', 'pop', 'tune', 'Then', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'was', 'Best', 'Buy', 'humming', 'Thing', 'Do', 'way', 'new', 'edition', 'DVD', 'unexpectedly', 'sale', 'thinking', 'bought', 'took', 'home', 'have', 'watched', 'three', 'times', 'theatrical', 'release', 'once', 'extended', 'version', 'twice', 'will', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'more.This', 'new', 'release', 'Thing', 'Do', 'underscores', 'why', 'Director', 'Cut', 'genre', 'DVD', 'become', 'so', 'invaluable', 'film', 'aficionados', 'myself.The', 'theatrical', 'version', 'priceless', 'still', 'Director', 'Cut', 'incredible', 'major', 'revelation', 'So', 'many', 'gaps', 'plot', 'have', 'been', 'filled', 'gaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'so', 'well', 'put-together', 'was', 'original', 'version', 'newer', 'version', 'made', 'film', 'mini-masterpiece.As', 'original', 'cast', 'excellent', 'plot', 'believable', 'charming', 'performances', 'are', 'funny', 'vibrant', 'true-to-life', 'version', 'quite', 'poignant.Charlize', 'Theron', 'character', 'Tina', 'relationship', 'Guy', 'particular', 'suddenly', 'become', 'crucial', 'elements', 'early', 'plot', 'development', 'minor', 'character', 'original', 'version', 'character', 'fleshed-out', 'one', 'HYSTERICAL', 'scene', 'dentist', 'chair', 'caught', 'off-guard', 'humour', 'nearly', 'choked', 'death', 'laughter', 'Even', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'character', 'group', 'manager', 'Mr.', 'White', 'more', 'developed', 'interesting', 'scene', 'dialogue', 'when', 'group', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'same', 'hotel', 'Lucy', 'Ricky', 'stayed', 'Guy', 'who', 'gently', 'drunk', 'Mr.', 'White', 'guy', 'named', 'Lloyd.Even', 'Bass', 'Player', 'Wonder', 'bass', 'player', 'who', 'never', 'given', 'name', 'played', 'adorable', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'scene', 'two', 'not', 'original', 'film', 'sweetness', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'sly', 'sexiness', '.Liv', 'Tyler', 'role', 'Jimmy', 'girlfriend', 'Faye', 'even', 'more', 'developed', 'such', 'marvelous', 'actress', 'film', 'really', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie', 'newer', 'version', 'only', 'wonderful', 'mystique', 'film.And', 'course', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Lenny', 'still', 'as', 'funny', 'ever', 'one', 'band', 'member', 'who', 'fear', 'push', 'envelope', 'ride', 'roller-coaster', 'success', 'wherever', 'them.I', 'recommend', 'new', 'version', 'Thing', 'Do', 'whole-heartedly', 'original', 'extended-cut', 'lively', 'spirited', 'upbeat', 'thoroughly', 'delightful', 'viewing', 'experience.And', 'am', 'STILL', 'humming', 'Thing', 'Do']",That Thing You Do VHS

415768,A1S4E1QSHSAD8O,6304342462,R. D. Clark,"[3, 3]","I confess that I love this movie all out of proportion to its stature. It won't change anyone's life or give them profound insights into the human condition but, especially for people who grew up in the Sixties, it provides a perfect little picture of a time and a place and a milieu -- the dawn of the modern rock era in a typical small American city -- and it does so with spark, humor, and excellent characterization. It's fun, but it's grounded in the real lives that some of us actually led.This new Director's Cut restores a great deal of footage. Fortunately for newcomers to the film, the original theatrical cut is also included, and it's the version that should be seen first. There really was nothing wrong with that version at all; I always thought of it as ""a perfect little film.""The longer version isn't ""little"" any more, but it's still pretty much perfect. What's added does slow the pace of the first half of the movie considerably (undoubtedly why it was removed), and now it takes much too long for the core narrative, tracing the short but forgettable career of The (one-hit) Wonders, to get going.But once you know the story, you won't care, and you'll love the added sequences expanding on the relationship between Guy (Tom Everett Scott) and the shallow, ambitious Tina (Charlize Theron) who sees much more of a future with a hunky dentist (Keith Neubert) than with a drummer in a rock band. The quality of the writing and acting in these and other restored scenes is fully consistent with the rest of the movie.It's too bad there's no commentary track, but the second disc's extras are worth watching, and one of them -- The Story of the Wonders -- almost serves the function of a commentary, as Hanks and the actors talk about the backstories and personalities of their characters. Additional extras provide the usual array of making-of and behind-the-scenes footage.Should you replace your old DVD? If this is a movie you keep coming back to, then yes, you'll want to have the Director's Cut.

415769,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6304342462,Reviewer,"[4, 5]","Tom Hanks wrote and directed this paean to the glory days of rock n' roll, an era in which even the wildest music still reflected a certain innocence, long since gone if not forgotten, before the advent of Metal, Rap and Grunge.  It's 1964, and ""That Thing You Do!"" is about to become a hit record for a small band out of Erie, Pa., who call themselves the ""Oneders (pronounced Wonders),"" but who are destined to begin their musical odyssey know as the ""Oh-NEED-ers.""  Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) works in his father's appliance store, but when the band's drummer breaks his arm right before a gig, Guy is asked to sit in for him.  And it winds up being a case of being in the right place at the right time for Guy, like when Ringo joined The Beatles, and the rest-- as they say-- is history.It's a lively, upbeat tale in which luck, talent and chance all play a part.  Hanks presents the upside of making it in the music business, including the adrenaline rush of hearing one's own song on the radio for the first time, as well as all the hoopla that surrounds those who happen to be in the spotlight at the moment.  But he also shows the downside:  The creative differences and in-fighting which plagues just about any band ever formed to some degree at one time or another, the personality conflicts and petty jealousies that are apt to surface at any time, and the reality of dealing with bloated egos, adoring fans and rude, insensitive record label executives who could care less about the talent that is putting the coins in their coffers, as long as they're selling records.For the most part, Hanks keeps it lighthearted and cheerful, which-- along with the original songs (some of which he helped write)-- makes this an entertaining, fun and thoroughly enjoyable movie.  He sugar-coats the dark side of it all to a certain extent, which makes the bad things that happen a bit easier to swallow, though it compromises the impact of the events somewhat as they unfold.  Then again, he manages to maintain the credibility and integrity of his story, and after all, ""this"" is the film he wanted to make, and he presents it exactly as intended.  Hanks captures a sense of time and place with this film, and also that same sense of reality conveyed by The Beatles' film, ""A Hard Day's Night,"" intentionally avoiding the more stoic reality of the more recent ""Almost Famous.""  All three films are fairly true to life, but with varying degrees of honesty.  It's a matter of whether to ""imply,"" as Hanks has done, or to be explicit, as Cameron Crowe chose to do with his film.With this film Hanks proves that he is equally as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it; he knows exactly where he wants to take his audience and when, and he does it quite successfully.  He also extracts some nice performances from his actors, especially Scott, Johnathon Schaech (Jimmy, the lead singer), Steve Zahn (Lenny, on guitar) and Liv Tyler as Faye Dolan, Jimmy's girlfriend, who takes the brunt of the blunt edge of Jimmy's sudden notoriety.  Hanks also turns in a notable performance himself, as Mr. White, the representative of one of the labels interested in the Oneders.The supporting cast includes Ethan Embry (The Bass Player), Charlize Theron (Tina), Obba Babatunde (Lamarr), Giovanni Ribisi (Chad), Chris Ellis (Phil), Alex Rocco (Sol), Bill Cobbs (Del Paxton), Peter Scolari (Tony), Rita Wilson (Marguerite), Chris Isaak (Uncle Bob) and Kevin Pollak (Boss Koss).  What ""Happy Days"" was to television, ""That Thing You Do!"" is to movies; a film that evokes that perceived sense of  innocence of a time when life at least seemed simpler.  For the more distance you put between the present and the ""Good old days,"" the better they get.  In reality, they may not have been better, but Hanks preserves that illusion by giving us a picture of the way we'd at least like to think things were.  And it's more than a pleasant diversion; this is a feel-good film you'll be able to enjoy time and again, because it takes you to a place you'd like to be-- a place you've been to before at one time or another, in one way or another, if only in your mind.  And that Hanks can take you there so readily is not only a credit to his talent, but another fine example of the pure magic of the movies.",4,Hanks Makes The Magic With The Music!,987897600,"04 22, 2001",2001,4301,"['Tom', 'Hanks', 'wrote', 'directed', 'paean', 'glory', 'days', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'era', 'even', 'wildest', 'music', 'still', 'reflected', 'certain', 'innocence', 'long', 'gone', 'not', 'forgotten', 'advent', 'Metal', 'Rap', 'Grunge', '1964', 'Thing', 'Do', 'become', 'hit', 'record', 'small', 'band', 'Erie', 'Pa.', 'who', 'call', 'Oneders', 'pronounced', 'Wonders', 'who', 'are', 'destined', 'begin', 'musical', 'odyssey', 'know', 'Oh-NEED-ers', 'Drummer', 'Guy', 'Patterson', 'Tom', 'Everett', 'Scott', 'father', 'appliance', 'store', 'when', 'band', 'drummer', 'arm', 'right', 'gig', 'Guy', 'asked', 'sit', 'up', 'being', 'case', 'being', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'Guy', 'when', 'Ringo', 'joined', 'Beatles', 'rest', 'say', 'history.It', 'lively', 'upbeat', 'tale', 'luck', 'talent', 'chance', 'play', 'part', 'upside', 'making', 'music', 'business', 'including', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'hearing', 'one', 'own', 'song', 'radio', 'first', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'hoopla', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'spotlight', 'moment', 'also', 'downside', 'creative', 'differences', 'in-fighting', 'just', 'band', 'ever', 'formed', 'degree', 'one', 'time', 'personality', 'conflicts', 'petty', 'jealousies', 'are', 'apt', 'surface', 'time', 'reality', 'dealing', 'bloated', 'egos', 'adoring', 'fans', 'rude', 'insensitive', 'record', 'label', 'executives', 'who', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'talent', 'putting', 'coins', 'coffers', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'selling', 'records.For', 'most', 'part', 'Hanks', 'lighthearted', 'cheerful', 'original', 'songs', 'helped', 'write', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'dark', 'side', 'certain', 'extent', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'bit', 'easier', 'swallow', 'impact', 'events', 'somewhat', 'unfold', 'Then', 'again', 'maintain', 'credibility', 'integrity', 'story', 'film', 'wanted', 'make', 'exactly', 'intended', 'Hanks', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'film', 'also', 'same', 'sense', 'reality', 'conveyed', 'Beatles', 'film', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'intentionally', 'avoiding', 'more', 'stoic', 'reality', 'more', 'recent', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'fairly', 'true', 'life', 'varying', 'degrees', 'honesty', 'matter', 'imply', 'Hanks', 'done', 'be', 'explicit', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'chose', 'do', 'film.With', 'film', 'Hanks', 'equally', 'adept', 'camera', 'front', 'exactly', 'where', 'take', 'audience', 'when', 'quite', 'successfully', 'also', 'nice', 'performances', 'actors', 'especially', 'Scott', 'Johnathon', 'Schaech', 'Jimmy', 'lead', 'singer', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Lenny', 'guitar', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Faye', 'Dolan', 'Jimmy', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'brunt', 'blunt', 'edge', 'Jimmy', 'sudden', 'notoriety', 'Hanks', 'also', 'notable', 'performance', 'Mr.', 'White', 'representative', 'one', 'labels', 'interested', 'Oneders.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'Bass', 'Player', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Tina', 'Obba', 'Babatunde', 'Lamarr', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Chad', 'Chris', 'Ellis', 'Phil', 'Alex', 'Rocco', 'Sol', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'Del', 'Paxton', 'Peter', 'Scolari', 'Tony', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Marguerite', 'Chris', 'Isaak', 'Uncle', 'Bob', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'Boss', 'Koss', 'What', 'Happy', 'Days', 'was', 'television', 'Thing', 'Do', 'movies', 'film', 'perceived', 'sense', 'innocence', 'time', 'when', 'life', 'least', 'seemed', 'simpler', 'more', 'distance', 'put', 'present', 'Good', 'old', 'days', 'better', 'get', 'reality', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Hanks', 'illusion', 'giving', 'picture', 'way', ""'d"", 'least', 'think', 'things', 'were', 'more', 'pleasant', 'diversion', 'feel-good', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'time', 'again', 'place', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'place', ""'ve"", 'been', 'one', 'time', 'one', 'way', 'only', 'mind', 'Hanks', 'can', 'take', 'there', 'so', 'readily', 'not', 'only', 'credit', 'talent', 'fine', 'example', 'pure', 'magic', 'movies']",That Thing You Do VHS

The last great one before this was &quot;American Graffiti.&quot; Tom Hanks takes a very easy-going hand with the direction of this excellent movie, which is one of the film's strong points. It moves at a fast, yet leisurely pace and has a good story to tell about one of the millions of one hit wonder band that crop up, have a hit or two, and then just when they are about to become the hugest group in the world, disappear into oblivion. The group in this movie, therefore is, aptly called the &quot;Wonders.&quot; (The original spelling of their name, the &quot;One-ders&quot; has to be changed because people kept pronouncing it &quot;Oh needers&quot;.) This movie is a very light, fun musical comedy/drama with a bouncy, authentic-sounding score, highlighted by the excellent title number and some other faux-60s pop hits, and delightful performances from an exuberant cast. Hanks even has a small part as their manager, in a very downplayed, tasteful performance.  This movie is wise to never take itself or its plot too seriously, acknowledging throughout, even during the breakup, that the &quot;Wonders&quot; was really a whim more than anything else throughout their shortlived history. Many clever set pieces compare the &quot;Wonders&quot; to parts of Beatle history, the difference being that the Beatles had more than one or two hit singles. All in all, this movie is a fun, vibrantly colorful look at the 60s music industry, that gently and subtly parodies the era while celebrating it simulaneously. P.S. Look for a fabulous cameo by Rita Wilson, Hanks' real-life wife as a cocktail waitress.",5,Finally on DVD!!!,988156800,"04 25, 2001",2001,1713,"[""'re"", 'not', 'likely', 'find', 'more', 'sweet', 'affectionately', 'drawn', 'portrait', 'time', 'era', 'film', 'last', 'great', 'one', 'was', 'quot', 'American', 'Graffiti.', 'quot', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'very', 'easy-going', 'hand', 'direction', 'excellent', 'movie', 'one', 'film', 'strong', 'points', 'fast', 'yet', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'good', 'story', 'tell', 'one', 'millions', 'one', 'hit', 'wonder', 'band', 'crop', 'up', 'have', 'hit', 'two', 'then', 'just', 'when', 'are', 'become', 'hugest', 'group', 'world', 'disappear', 'oblivion', 'group', 'movie', 'therefore', 'aptly', 'called', 'quot', 'Wonders.', 'quot', 'original', 'spelling', 'name', 'quot', 'One-ders', 'quot', 'be', 'changed', 'people', 'kept', 'pronouncing', 'quot', 'Oh', 'needers', 'quot', 'movie', 'very', 'light', 'fun', 'musical', 'comedy/drama', 'bouncy', 'authentic-sounding', 'score', 'highlighted', 'excellent', 'title', 'number', 'other', 'faux-60s', 'pop', 'hits', 'delightful', 'performances', 'exuberant', 'cast', 'Hanks', 'even', 'small', 'part', 'manager', 'very', 'downplayed', 'tasteful', 'performance', 'movie', 'wise', 'never', 'take', 'plot', 'too', 'seriously', 'acknowledging', 'even', 'breakup', 'quot', 'Wonders', 'quot', 'was', 'really', 'whim', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'shortlived', 'history', 'Many', 'clever', 'set', 'pieces', 'compare', 'quot', 'Wonders', 'quot', 'parts', 'Beatle', 'history', 'difference', 'being', 'Beatles', 'had', 'more', 'one', 'two', 'hit', 'singles', 'movie', 'fun', 'vibrantly', 'colorful', 'look', '60s', 'music', 'industry', 'gently', 'subtly', 'era', 'celebrating', 'simulaneously', 'P.S', 'Look', 'fabulous', 'cameo', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Hanks', 'real-life', 'wife', 'cocktail', 'waitress']",That Thing You Do VHS
415773,A1BRXLFWILNICE,6304342462,Robin McDonald,"[3, 3]","This is a formula film about the rise and fall of a small 60s garage band.  It touches all the expected bases, but it manages to get the formula right including managing to center the film around a really great title song. It has fun likeable characters from the father who runs the appliance store, to the band members and even the waitress in the bar later in the film.  I don't think the story would have been less fun if you focused on anyone in the film. It is a story that likes people in the style of the old Capra films. There are so many nice bits like the running gags about the store lights and the name of the band.  But the things that make you fall in love with the film are joyful touches like the first time the band's song is heard on the radio.  You can't help but feel happy right along with them. Liv Tyler is a great as the girlfriend and Tom Everett Scott the drummer is terrific as what amounts to a younger alter ego of Tom Hanks. Its almost like watching Hanks mentor himself. That Thing You Do is a film you want to watch when you just want to have a good time. It doesn't have any dark shadowy areas.  It is forthright and unpretentious about what it is...fun.

Thankfully this new version is mostly a success. With no major scenes added (Besides a funny cameo from Kevin Pollack) this 2 1/2hr cut is a much more layered film with worthy character development (the family back home and more Charlize Theron..surprise)  and a lot more insight into the behind the scenes of 60' entertainment and the backstage life of a Rock&Roll; band. The now classic anthem title track still manages to hold out for the duration of the film, a much better compliment than the original(TV Movie) score. With great wardrobe, set design, a quick pace, and sharp script by Hanks the movie really deserves it's now epic length.

415776,A1LHAXBM5GBJS2,6304342462,Scooter McGavin,"[1, 1]","Going all the way back to the Bosom Buddies days, I have been a big Tom Hanks guy (no pun intended, okay, maybe a little). Many kids today probably never heard of that show or even now that Hanks was arguably one of the funniest men of the eighties. This may be thanks to his back to back academy awards for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump along with the one that got away, Apollo 13. With that trio of films, Hank pretty much had carte blanche to do as he pleased in Hollywood and after a few serious films, Hands decided for a lighter fair that he decided to write and direct himself.That Thing You Do! followed the rise of a sixties band, the One-ders, from talent shows in Erie, Pennsylvania to the Billboard charts thanks their the uber-catchy song that shares the name of the movie. Even though stars in the movie, he doesn't show up until the middle of the movie as the bands' big time manager who wisely changes the band's name to the Wonders to avoid confusion and mispronunciation. Instead Hanks leaves the movie in the hands of a cast who were relative unknowns back in 1996.Leading the way was the Tom Hanks look-alike Tom Everett Scott (Dead Man on Campus) as the last minute replacement for a talent show as the band's original drummer, played by Earl Hickey's old pal Ralph, broke his hand right before the show. Not that he endeared himself to his new band mates, primarily principle writer Johnathon Schaech (The Sweetest Thing), who song Scott speeds up as Schaech wrote That Thing You Do as a balled. But the rest of the band, Steve Zahn (Saving Silverman) the rambunctious guitarist, and Ethan Embry (Can't Hardly Wait) filling out the quiet one quota in the band.And Hanks isn't the only one in the cast with a little golden man as the film was one of the first times anyone saw Charlize Theron (Sweet November) as she shows up as Scott's disinterested girlfriend. Then there was Liv Tyler (Jersey Girl), who may be a little more well versed in seventies rock than sixties pop, as the unofficial fifth member of the band and Schaech's main squeeze. Hanks wasn't shy about also giving some work to his friends and family as both his wife and kid, Colin in his first on screen roll, make cameos as well as his former Bosom Buddy Peter Scolari who hosts the Ed Sullivan like show the Wonders performs on.Just as important as the casting was the role of writing a song that actually could have been a hit back in the sixties. And they definitely were successful with that with That Thing You Do, a catchy ditty written by Adam Schlesinger, who later got a hit singing about Stacy's Mom with his band Fountains of Wayne years later. The song was so good that not only did the song fictitiously land in the top ten on the Billboard charts in the sixties, it peaked at forty-one back in 1996 for real.Over ten years after its initial release, the movie gets a special edition treatment with the Tom Hanks' Extended Cut with over thirty minutes of footage of scenes that originally saw the cutting room floor for the original theater version. This does make the the Extended Cut a little long in the tooth in parts of the film (but you can always check out the Original Theatrical Release if the extended version is too long for you). There is also a second disk chalk full of extras that includes three featurettes, a reunion of the cast, HBO First Look, your garden variety of TV spots and trailers, and more.",4,"You Gotta Keep Playin', No Matter with Who",1181260800,"06 8, 2007",2007,3422,"['Going', 'way', 'back', 'Bosom', 'Buddies', 'days', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'guy', 'pun', 'intended', 'maybe', 'little', 'Many', 'kids', 'today', 'probably', 'never', 'heard', 'show', 'even', 'now', 'Hanks', 'was', 'arguably', 'one', 'funniest', 'men', 'eighties', 'may', 'be', 'thanks', 'back', 'back', 'academy', 'awards', 'Philadelphia', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'one', 'got', 'away', 'Apollo', '13', 'trio', 'films', 'Hank', 'pretty', 'much', 'had', 'carte', 'blanche', 'do', 'pleased', 'Hollywood', 'few', 'serious', 'films', 'Hands', 'decided', 'lighter', 'fair', 'decided', 'write', 'direct', 'himself.That', 'Thing', 'Do', 'followed', 'rise', 'sixties', 'band', 'One-ders', 'talent', 'shows', 'Erie', 'Pennsylvania', 'Billboard', 'charts', 'thanks', 'uber-catchy', 'song', 'shares', 'name', 'movie', 'Even', 'stars', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'middle', 'movie', 'bands', 'big', 'time', 'manager', 'who', 'wisely', 'band', 'name', 'Wonders', 'avoid', 'confusion', 'mispronunciation', 'Instead', 'Hanks', 'movie', 'hands', 'cast', 'who', 'were', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'back', '1996.Leading', 'way', 'was', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'look-alike', 'Tom', 'Everett', 'Scott', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Campus', 'last', 'minute', 'replacement', 'talent', 'show', 'band', 'original', 'drummer', 'played', 'Earl', 'Hickey', 'old', 'pal', 'Ralph', 'broke', 'hand', 'right', 'show', 'Not', 'endeared', 'new', 'band', 'mates', 'primarily', 'principle', 'writer', 'Johnathon', 'Schaech', 'Sweetest', 'Thing', 'who', 'song', 'Scott', 'up', 'Schaech', 'wrote', 'Thing', 'Do', 'balled', 'rest', 'band', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Saving', 'Silverman', 'rambunctious', 'guitarist', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'filling', 'out', 'quiet', 'one', 'quota', 'band.And', 'Hanks', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'cast', 'little', 'golden', 'man', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'times', 'anyone', 'saw', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Sweet', 'November', 'up', 'Scott', 'disinterested', 'girlfriend', 'Then', 'was', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Jersey', 'Girl', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'well', 'versed', 'seventies', 'rock', 'sixties', 'pop', 'unofficial', 'fifth', 'member', 'band', 'Schaech', 'main', 'squeeze', 'Hanks', 'was', ""n't"", 'shy', 'also', 'giving', 'work', 'friends', 'family', 'wife', 'kid', 'Colin', 'first', 'screen', 'roll', 'make', 'cameos', 'as', 'well', 'former', 'Bosom', 'Buddy', 'Peter', 'Scolari', 'who', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'show', 'Wonders', 'performs', 'on.Just', 'as', 'important', 'casting', 'was', 'role', 'writing', 'song', 'actually', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hit', 'back', 'sixties', 'definitely', 'were', 'successful', 'Thing', 'Do', 'catchy', 'ditty', 'written', 'Adam', 'Schlesinger', 'who', 'later', 'got', 'hit', 'singing', 'Stacy', 'Mom', 'band', 'Fountains', 'Wayne', 'years', 'later', 'song', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'song', 'fictitiously', 'land', 'top', 'ten', 'Billboard', 'charts', 'sixties', 'peaked', 'forty-one', 'back', '1996', 'real.Over', 'ten', 'years', 'initial', 'release', 'movie', 'special', 'edition', 'treatment', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'footage', 'scenes', 'originally', 'saw', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'original', 'theater', 'version', 'make', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'little', 'long', 'tooth', 'parts', 'film', 'can', 'always', 'check', 'out', 'Original', 'Theatrical', 'Release', 'extended', 'version', 'too', 'long', 'also', 'second', 'disk', 'chalk', 'full', 'extras', 'three', 'featurettes', 'reunion', 'cast', 'HBO', 'First', 'Look', 'garden', 'variety', 'TV', 'spots', 'trailers', 'more']",That Thing You Do VHS

Yes, we sat drinking Cokes and trying to think of a name for the band, yes, we were in talent shows, yes, we anxiously awaited the airplay of our first record. And yes, many a good band fell by the wayside thanks to egotistical singers that never made it. Tom Hanks wrote and directed this film,  he also wrote or co-wrote much of the soundtrack and found parts for his wife and kids and many friends.This ""Director's Cut"" adds another 40+ minutes of film rescued from the cutting room floor. The additional footage does not change the story or better explain any of the scenes, proving once again that the editing people really do earn their salaries. The extra add ins to the new version really do enhance the film watching experience. There are many ""gee I didn't know that"" moments. Making it a must have purchase. I do wish they would put together a package sale price that would include the music CD as well.An additional area where this film shines is it's ""continuity"" the musical instruments, cars and fashions are impecably accurate. Even down to the ""tolex"" covering on the Fender Amplifiers being the right color and reflecting the new color as it came out.

415787,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,6304342462,Tim Janson,"[2, 2]","Tom Hanks wrote, directed, and stars in this 1964 era tale about a Pennsylvania garage rock -n- roll band hitting the big time.  The band consists of singer Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech) Guitarist Lenny (steve Zahn), Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) and the bass player who is never named (Ethan Embry).  They call themselves the Oneders but it becomes a running gag that people keep calling them the ""O-need-ers"" They write a little ballad called ""That Thing you Do"" but when they play it at a local talent show, drummer guy goes to fast and a ballad becomes a snappy, upbeat and danceable tune.  They become popular locally and cut a 45"" to sell at the clubs they play.They soon are discovered by Mr. White, (Hanks) who is a record executive and manager and immediately changes the spelling of the band's name to ""The Wonders"" and gets them on a tour with a number of other acts from their record label.  The band eventually makes their national TV debut on a ""Ed Sullivan-like"" variety show.The movie is intended to be sort of an American-ized Beatles with a group of four good looking lads, screaming teenage girls, and a rapid rise to fame.  The bandmembers all have their own unique ideas: lenny Just wants to get famous and loves life, Jimmy is the one who's overly serious about his music and always worried about compromising his beliefs, Guy at heart would rather be playing jazz.Tom Hanks is really marvelous as manager Mr. White.  A quick-witted, fast talking, but honest guy who gets the Wonders gigs in 60's beach movies, and on the radio and TV.  hanks also did a great job as director in capturing the look and feel of the small pennsylvania town in 1964.  Guys father runs an appliance store and it is thoroughly detailed down to the big, stereo consoles and 60's era toasters.The music of the film was also written by Hanks along with the great Howard Shore and is pure 60's.  If you didn't know any better you'd swear it was right out of 1964 rather than 1996.  it really captured the music of the times with its Beatles-like melodies.I should also mention Liv Tyler as Jimmy's loyal girlfriend Faye who soon finds herself taking a backseat to Jimmy's music as well as adoring female fans.Just a fantastic movie.",5,CATCHY LITTLE 1960'S NOSTALGIA,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,2236,"['Tom', 'Hanks', 'wrote', 'directed', 'stars', '1964', 'era', 'tale', 'Pennsylvania', 'garage', 'rock', '-n-', 'roll', 'band', 'hitting', 'big', 'time', 'band', 'singer', 'Jimmy', 'Johnathon', 'Schaech', 'Guitarist', 'Lenny', 'steve', 'Zahn', 'Drummer', 'Guy', 'Patterson', 'Tom', 'Everett', 'Scott', 'bass', 'player', 'who', 'never', 'named', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'call', 'Oneders', 'running', 'gag', 'people', 'keep', 'calling', 'O-need-ers', 'write', 'little', 'ballad', 'called', 'Thing', 'Do', 'when', 'play', 'local', 'talent', 'show', 'drummer', 'guy', 'fast', 'ballad', 'snappy', 'upbeat', 'danceable', 'tune', 'become', 'popular', 'locally', 'cut', '45', 'sell', 'clubs', 'play.They', 'soon', 'are', 'discovered', 'Mr.', 'White', 'Hanks', 'who', 'record', 'executive', 'manager', 'immediately', 'spelling', 'band', 'name', 'Wonders', 'tour', 'number', 'other', 'acts', 'record', 'label', 'band', 'eventually', 'national', 'TV', 'debut', 'Ed', 'Sullivan-like', 'variety', 'show.The', 'movie', 'intended', 'be', 'sort', 'American-ized', 'Beatles', 'group', 'four', 'good', 'looking', 'lads', 'screaming', 'teenage', 'girls', 'rapid', 'rise', 'fame', 'bandmembers', 'have', 'own', 'unique', 'ideas', 'lenny', 'Just', 'get', 'famous', 'life', 'Jimmy', 'one', 'who', 'overly', 'serious', 'music', 'always', 'worried', 'compromising', 'beliefs', 'Guy', 'heart', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'playing', 'jazz.Tom', 'Hanks', 'really', 'marvelous', 'manager', 'Mr.', 'White', 'quick-witted', 'fast', 'talking', 'honest', 'guy', 'who', 'Wonders', 'gigs', '60', 'beach', 'movies', 'radio', 'TV', 'hanks', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'director', 'capturing', 'look', 'feel', 'small', 'pennsylvania', 'town', '1964', 'Guys', 'father', 'appliance', 'store', 'thoroughly', 'detailed', 'down', 'big', 'stereo', 'consoles', '60', 'era', 'toasters.The', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'written', 'Hanks', 'great', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'pure', '60', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', ""'d"", 'swear', 'was', 'right', '1964', 'rather', '1996.', 'really', 'captured', 'music', 'times', 'Beatles-like', 'melodies.I', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Jimmy', 'loyal', 'girlfriend', 'Faye', 'who', 'soon', 'taking', 'backseat', 'Jimmy', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'adoring', 'female', 'fans.Just', 'fantastic', 'movie']",That Thing You Do VHS

The theatrical cut is far superior as the director's cut is mainly more stuff with Tina and it's all just filler material that really adds nothing to the story. I was in a band back in high school so some of this film is quite relatable but this review is more about the technical side of things.Picture Quality:A few scenes look decent on Blu Ray but, overall, it's very low quality video. It looks more like an upscaled dvd and there are a lot of soft edges and moments that just look straight up out of focus. It's painful to see a good movie get a half a**ed treatment like this. Some movies that have suffered this fate upon initial release, ""The Fifth Element"" have later been reissued correctly but I don't get why this can't be done properly the first time. You'd think a Tom Hanks movie, his directorial debut no less, would have been more carefully scrutinized during the transfer process.Audio Quality:I know that everyone has different speaker setups but for me, with a 5.1 system, the volume fluctuates wildly when the songs start up. I get that they're supposed to be louder but it sounds like it goes from 5 to 10 instantly and sometimes the drums sound too loud in the mix.Maybe one day this cool movie will get a proper HD release but this sure isn't it.",2,A Huge Blu-Ray Disappointment,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,1290,"['like', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'far', 'superior', 'director', 'cut', 'mainly', 'more', 'stuff', 'Tina', 'just', 'filler', 'material', 'really', 'nothing', 'story', 'was', 'band', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'so', 'film', 'quite', 'relatable', 'review', 'more', 'technical', 'side', 'things.Picture', 'Quality', 'few', 'scenes', 'look', 'decent', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'overall', 'very', 'low', 'quality', 'video', 'more', 'upscaled', 'dvd', 'are', 'lot', 'soft', 'edges', 'moments', 'just', 'look', 'straight', 'focus', 'painful', 'see', 'good', 'movie', 'get', 'half', 'a**ed', 'treatment', 'movies', 'have', 'suffered', 'fate', 'initial', 'release', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'have', 'later', 'been', 'reissued', 'correctly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'properly', 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'think', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'movie', 'directorial', 'debut', 'less', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'carefully', 'scrutinized', 'transfer', 'process.Audio', 'Quality', 'know', 'everyone', 'different', 'speaker', 'setups', '5.1', 'system', 'volume', 'wildly', 'when', 'songs', 'start', 'up', 'get', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'louder', '5', '10', 'instantly', 'sometimes', 'drums', 'sound', 'too', 'loud', 'mix.Maybe', 'one', 'day', 'cool', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'proper', 'HD', 'release', 'sure', ""n't""]",That Thing You Do VHS

Tom Hanks plays the record executive who mentors their group, appropriately named ""The Wonders"" as they are put through their paces.My favorite scene is the one in which Hanks' character ""Mr. White"" chats with drummer Guy Patterson (played by the appealing Tom Everett Scott)--the only one of the four with a good head on his shoulders.  Hanks' exec has seen dozens of these groups come and go, and has no trouble sizing up each band member.  While White assesses the arrogant lead singer as ""the talent"", he clearly recognizes the reflective percussionist as ""the smart guy"".Indeed, it is the drummer Guy Patterson who really loves music for its own sake--not as just a ticket to nominal success--and who, while The Wonders are in LA, seeks out a classic jazz club and hangs out with the musicians he truly admires.  Make sure to watch for Hanks' real life wife Rita Wilson as a waitress at the club.It is also worth noting that a young Liv Tyler plays the girl friend of the lead singer--and the girl who the thoughtful young drummer years for! Charlize Theron plays Guy's erstwhile girlfriend.  It is also interesting to observe that Tom Everett Scott looks very much like a young Tom Hanks.

415798,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,6304342462,Wanda B. Red,"[1, 5]","This is a sweet film. Not only did Tom Hanks write and direct it; he also composed some of the songs. Set in the early 1960s, the film chronicles the rise of the (entirely fictional) band ""The Wonders"" (aka the ""One-ders"" as in they end up with only a single hit). Their hit song ""That Thing You Do"" rises in the charts, and they cross the country playing state fairs, finally ending in Hollywood.This concept allows us all the pleasures of nostalgia for a far more innocent time (at least as it's portrayed here): the cars, the clothes, the hair styles, the step-and-fetch-it bellboy who attempts to micromanage the love interest from his spot in the taxi-line. Liv Tyler and Charlize Theron are, of course, gorgeous, and the guys are so cute too. Tom Hanks' boyish grin has never been brighter. And despite the inevitable tensions that cause the band to break up, the film comes to a sunny and satisfying end -- Nothing really bad ever seems to happen to this crew. The whole thing would be hard to believe if in fact it were not entirely ficitonal, including the pseudo-biographies that tell us what each character is ""doing now."" Oddly that chutzpah (giving us the real history of made-up folks) signals both the movie's strengths and weaknesses.Its singleminded optimism is why this isn't a five-star movie, for all its charm. All bright surface, the film becomes a tad repetitive. Case in point: The sheer number of times that the hit song ""That Thing You Do"" is played. It's a snappy tune, no doubt, but we don't need to hear it five hundred times (well, maybe it was only about twelve). This could still have been a sweet and adorable movie with just a little more preparation for some of the character flaws that lead to the conclusion. Definitely fun to watch, but still too predictable.We WANT to think that nothing was going on in this time period but aspiring bands competing with the Beatles, soda fountains, neon signs, princess phones, and cute girls with curlers in their hair, but actually -- as Hanks clearly knows -- that bass player who volunteers for the Marines is heading off to Vietnam and that bellboy will be marching for civil rights in a quick shake of the hourglass.I'm not against innocent pleasures, but this film is aggressively cheerful and one-dimensional. A more interesting and entertaining movie could have been made about these same themes.",4,Pleasant and Predictable,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,2379,"['sweet', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'write', 'direct', 'also', 'composed', 'songs', 'Set', 'early', '1960s', 'film', 'rise', 'entirely', 'fictional', 'band', 'Wonders', 'One-ders', 'end', 'up', 'only', 'single', 'hit', 'hit', 'song', 'Thing', 'Do', 'charts', 'cross', 'country', 'playing', 'state', 'fairs', 'finally', 'ending', 'Hollywood.This', 'concept', 'pleasures', 'nostalgia', 'far', 'more', 'innocent', 'time', 'least', 'portrayed', 'here', 'cars', 'clothes', 'hair', 'styles', 'step-and-fetch-it', 'bellboy', 'who', 'micromanage', 'love', 'interest', 'spot', 'taxi-line', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'are', 'course', 'gorgeous', 'guys', 'are', 'so', 'cute', 'too', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'boyish', 'grin', 'never', 'been', 'brighter', 'inevitable', 'tensions', 'cause', 'band', 'break', 'up', 'film', 'sunny', 'satisfying', 'end', 'Nothing', 'really', 'bad', 'ever', 'happen', 'crew', 'whole', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'believe', 'fact', 'were', 'not', 'entirely', 'ficitonal', 'including', 'pseudo-biographies', 'tell', 'what', 'character', 'doing', 'now', 'Oddly', 'chutzpah', 'giving', 'real', 'history', 'made-up', 'folks', 'signals', 'movie', 'strengths', 'weaknesses.Its', 'singleminded', 'optimism', 'why', ""n't"", 'five-star', 'movie', 'charm', 'bright', 'surface', 'film', 'tad', 'repetitive', 'Case', 'point', 'sheer', 'number', 'times', 'hit', 'song', 'Thing', 'Do', 'played', 'snappy', 'tune', 'doubt', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'hear', 'five', 'hundred', 'times', 'well', 'maybe', 'was', 'only', 'about', 'twelve', 'could', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'sweet', 'adorable', 'movie', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'preparation', 'character', 'lead', 'conclusion', 'Definitely', 'fun', 'watch', 'still', 'too', 'predictable.We', 'WANT', 'think', 'nothing', 'was', 'going', 'time', 'period', 'aspiring', 'bands', 'competing', 'Beatles', 'soda', 'fountains', 'neon', 'signs', 'princess', 'phones', 'cute', 'girls', 'curlers', 'hair', 'actually', 'Hanks', 'clearly', 'bass', 'player', 'who', 'Marines', 'heading', 'off', 'Vietnam', 'bellboy', 'will', 'be', 'marching', 'civil', 'rights', 'quick', 'shake', 'hourglass.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'innocent', 'pleasures', 'film', 'aggressively', 'cheerful', 'one-dimensional', 'more', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'same', 'themes']",That Thing You Do VHS

For several weeks it seemed that whenever I sat down and started flipping around the channels, this was playing on VH-1.  After watching bits and pieces of it over this time period, I finally happened to tune in one night just as it was beginning.  It's a rare movie in that I was able to comfortably watch it with my two children, and even more rare that they asked me to play the cd when we were out and about in the racing mini van.  The two scenes that always get me are the scene where they play their first club date with Shades and he accidentally kicks the tempo of Jimmy's masterpiece up to it's correct level.  The actors did a great job of portraying a group coming to terms with the fact that they've indeed caught lightning in a bottle.  Another great scene is where they are first hearing the song on the radio.  Several times I've found myself joining in on their excitement and I have to remind myself that this is just a movie.  Well, it may be just a movie, but it's one that never seems to get old, and that has to be worth something.",5,Count me in.
