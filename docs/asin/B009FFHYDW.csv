I am the type of person that gets bored easily with DVD workouts, but this DVD and the episodes within it kept me engaged and motivated to keep coming back for more. I have been finding that even though I have been using this now for a few days I am still getting winded and tired after every workout (and I am not in the worst of shape). One of the things that I liked was that the videos are short, but pack a ton into the time that you have to workout. One other thing that I will add is that I used to use more intense workouts that were harder on my body and I find that I am getting just as much of a workout with this without the constant pressure on my body (which is a nice change).*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*",5,A Workout That Will Challenge You!,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",2013,861,"['not', 'easy', 'routine', 'will', 'challenge', 'daily', 'make', 'really', 'get', 'back', 'shape', 'time', 'flat', 'am', 'type', 'person', 'bored', 'easily', 'DVD', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'kept', 'engaged', 'motivated', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'have', 'been', 'finding', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'now', 'few', 'days', 'am', 'still', 'getting', 'winded', 'tired', 'workout', 'am', 'not', 'worst', 'shape', 'One', 'things', 'liked', 'was', 'videos', 'are', 'short', 'pack', 'ton', 'time', 'have', 'workout', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'will', 'add', 'used', 'use', 'more', 'intense', 'workouts', 'were', 'harder', 'body', 'find', 'am', 'getting', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'workout', 'constant', 'pressure', 'body', 'nice', 'change', 'received', 'copy', 'review', 'opinions', 'are', 'own*']",The Biggest Loser: 30-Day Power X-Train

You will definitely sweat; I also love the music on this one. It makes you want to move and groove for sure. Once again, Bob Harper is the one who really makes you sweat or want to snap! I nearly try to get through it. He also messes with Ramon, but he lost a lot of weight on this one compared to &#34;Calorie Knockout&#34; DVD by Biggest Loser too. He also cut that beautiful hair he once had.This one doesn't really offer modified moves except with Bob...I was surprised I made it through this one. I borrowed from the library and hope to get in the future.

Sometimes the Biggest Loser videos are only so-so because while I enjoy Bob's portion the other instuctors are just fair. But Dolvett Quince is just as good in this video.

The Biggest Loser Power Ab Blast. The name alone scared me because I am not allowed (as per my doctor) to do ab focused exercises but was able to do much of the DVD and thought it was great.
