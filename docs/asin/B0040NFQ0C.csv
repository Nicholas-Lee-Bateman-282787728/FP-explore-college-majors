1379520,A3F26MQYV4KTPS,B0040NFQ0C,"Deep83 ""the deeper I go""","[14, 17]","Please note that amazon has reviews bundled together for BOTH the old ""Complete Series"" collection (which was nothing more than all 10 individually released seasons shrinkwrapped together) and the new, amazing ""Yearbook"" edition, which is the definitive BH 90210 Box set that fans have been waiting for.I took the plunge and bought this without finding very many pictures online of the inside contents. It's very expensive so I had to sell off all my season sets which I faithfully purchased as they were released through the years. My Yearbook edition JUST came today, so I will not be reviewing the video content, which I have not watched yet. I am assuming that it is the same content from the other releases but I can't confirm that yet.As for the packaging, this box is HUGE and HEAVY! There are 72 discs packed into 2 custom-designed yearbooks. It looks like a lot of care went into the design. Show trivia and pictures of the cast are throughout the books. They also included pictures of supporting characters like Emily Valentine, Brandon's girlfriend Nikki, Donna's boyfriend Joe, etc. Little blurbs like ""Friends forever"" , ""current couple alert!"", ""Prom!"", ""The wedding that almost was"", etc are sprinkled throughout among the photos. It looks like things a young girl would write inside her own yearbook (The whole package is VERY girly, but I'm a guy. Hey, what can I say? I LOVED this show!) Both the outer box and the books are very sturdy. The ""pages"" inside the yearbooks are thick, glossy cardstock and not flimsy paper pages. This had to be the case because the pages in the books hold the discs in slots. I suppose sliding the discs in and out of the slots may cause some scuffs over time, but I would suggest handling them as delicately as possible.The actual discs are not the same ones from the previous releases as they have new graphics which are uniform throughout the set. All the discs are white, but they have color-accents which are unique for each season (For example Season 1 is blue, Season 2 is green, etc.) Again, I have not watched any of the discs yet so I can't comment on the video quality, or if these are the edited versions of the show with the alternate music. This set, however, does come with a BONUS disc (which is the 72nd disc) that contains a few extras like the 1 Year Reunion show from 2003, a new ""look back"" segment, and a ""Behind the scenes"" featurette from the early 90's. Oh, I also forgot to mention that it looks like the ""Extras"" from the previous discs also carried over onto these discs as those extras were listed in the book alongside the episode summaries.Overall, I'm very impressed with this box and I'm glad I have it. It's a great keepsake for any fan of the show. Try to get it when it goes on sale. Amazon have had it as low as $148.",5,Review For The New Yearbook Edition DVD Set,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,2803,"['Please', 'note', 'amazon', 'reviews', 'bundled', 'together', 'BOTH', 'old', 'Complete', 'Series', 'collection', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', '10', 'individually', 'released', 'seasons', 'shrinkwrapped', 'together', 'new', 'amazing', 'Yearbook', 'edition', 'definitive', 'BH', '90210', 'Box', 'set', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'for.I', 'took', 'plunge', 'bought', 'finding', 'very', 'many', 'pictures', 'online', 'inside', 'contents', 'very', 'expensive', 'had', 'sell', 'off', 'season', 'sets', 'faithfully', 'purchased', 'were', 'released', 'years', 'Yearbook', 'edition', 'JUST', 'came', 'today', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'reviewing', 'video', 'content', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'yet', 'am', 'assuming', 'same', 'content', 'other', 'releases', 'ca', ""n't"", 'confirm', 'yet.As', 'packaging', 'box', 'HUGE', 'HEAVY', 'are', '72', 'discs', 'packed', '2', 'custom-designed', 'yearbooks', 'lot', 'care', 'went', 'design', 'Show', 'trivia', 'pictures', 'cast', 'are', 'books', 'also', 'included', 'pictures', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Emily', 'Valentine', 'Brandon', 'girlfriend', 'Nikki', 'Donna', 'boyfriend', 'Joe', 'etc', 'Little', 'blurbs', 'Friends', 'forever', 'current', 'couple', 'alert', 'Prom', 'wedding', 'almost', 'was', 'etc', 'are', 'sprinkled', 'photos', 'things', 'young', 'girl', 'would', 'write', 'own', 'yearbook', 'whole', 'package', 'VERY', 'girly', ""'m"", 'guy', 'Hey', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'LOVED', 'show', 'outer', 'box', 'books', 'are', 'very', 'sturdy', 'pages', 'yearbooks', 'are', 'thick', 'glossy', 'cardstock', 'not', 'flimsy', 'paper', 'pages', 'had', 'be', 'case', 'pages', 'books', 'hold', 'discs', 'slots', 'suppose', 'sliding', 'discs', 'slots', 'may', 'cause', 'scuffs', 'time', 'would', 'suggest', 'handling', 'as', 'delicately', 'possible.The', 'actual', 'discs', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'ones', 'previous', 'releases', 'have', 'new', 'graphics', 'are', 'uniform', 'set', 'discs', 'are', 'white', 'have', 'color-accents', 'are', 'unique', 'season', 'example', 'Season', '1', 'blue', 'Season', '2', 'green', 'etc', 'Again', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'discs', 'yet', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'video', 'quality', 'are', 'edited', 'versions', 'show', 'alternate', 'music', 'set', 'however', 'come', 'BONUS', 'disc', '72nd', 'disc', 'few', 'extras', '1', 'Year', 'Reunion', 'show', '2003', 'new', 'look', 'back', 'segment', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'early', '90', 'Oh', 'also', 'forgot', 'mention', 'Extras', 'previous', 'discs', 'also', 'carried', 'discs', 'extras', 'were', 'listed', 'book', 'episode', 'summaries.Overall', ""'m"", 'very', 'impressed', 'box', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'great', 'keepsake', 'fan', 'show', 'Try', 'get', 'when', 'sale', 'Amazon', 'have', 'had', 'as', 'low', '148']",N/A

The book style of the cases is fine. But the discs, standard dvds, slide into slots in cardboard pages. This is just begging for scratches. Even if you get a bonus disc in the set, don't fall for it.

1379523,AGKR0WED80PF5,B0040NFQ0C,swimgym1285,"[157, 166]","Dear Fans,Remember when Dylan and Brenda broke up in season three and Brenda listened to ""Losing My Religion"" on a loop?  Yeah.  Well if you buy these dvds, you won't be hearing that.  Remember when Kelly and Dylan spent the night on the beach, also in season 3, and Sophie B. Hawkins, ""Damn I wish I was your lover"" played in the background.  That's gone too.So is ""Can't Cry Hard Enough"" when Dylan sees himself as a child after his dad ""dies.""  So is Guns n Roses' ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" after Scott dies in season 2.  So is ""Nobody Knows Me"" by Lyle Lovett after Antonia dies in season six.  So is ""Graduation Day"" by Chris Isaak in the beginning of Graduation Day in the season 7 finale.  So is ""Living in a Fantasy"" by the Rainbow Band when David starts using drugs in season four.You get the gist here?  Every song that you relate to this series has been taken from you through these dvds.  In Slumber Party in season one, the girls still sing to ""Mony Mony"" but the music playing in the background is different.  In season one's Perfect Mom, entire scenes have been removed because Jim Walsh originally plays keyboard throughout this episode.  And this trend only increases significantly throughout the series when the dvds begin to feature entire episodes that have been heavily edited from their original broadcasts. The edits are so extensive that they even cut the rush song in season four because the rights to ""Que Sera Sera"" weren't acquired. This practice saves CBS money at your expense.By not buying these dvds, you can send a message to CBS that it's not ok with us, the fans of the show, that they're profiting on these altered dvds and that they have tricked us into spending a great deal of money on cheap imitations of one of FOX's longest running series. If you love this show, please do not purchase this item.  Other studios and merchandisers have dealt with the music licensing issue in a much more appropriate and considerate manner by replacing songs that could not be cleared with other songs that correspond to the scenes and fall within the time period.  In these dvds however, CBS has without prejudice, replaced all of the music with in-house muzak that has never been heard since and will never be heard again.  This show and the people who worked on it deserve better than this.Please join me in boycotting these dvds and instead watch the show when it airs on SoapNet (starting with episode one as of yesterday) or even buy pirated dvds from websites like sell.com.  The people who did this don't deserve to profit on this release, and us fans do not deserve to be taken advantage of this way, especially when CBS was not willing to spend a little more money to make this a quality product for us.Sincerely,A 90210-er for life.1610 Lighthouse RoadSanta Monica, CA",1,Yeah....
