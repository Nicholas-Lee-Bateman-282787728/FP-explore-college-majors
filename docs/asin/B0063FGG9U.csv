1509148,A31VYFJN38A8QI,B0063FGG9U,Dangerous Dan,"[1, 1]","My wife came from a fairly strict home.  The family didn't have a TV past the early 70s.  When she was very little she remembered watching a show with her dad that involved characters named Jeremy, Jason, and Joshua.  She even thought about using those names for our kids.  It was fun to watch her as she slowly realized that this was the show she watched all those years ago when she was just 4.They don't make shows like this anymore, and truthfully, back then they rarely made them.  If you are looking for a show about logging in the Seattle area during the 1800s, this about your only choice.  The simple plot lines surrounding romantic and business problems resolved by people on their way to building a life together still resonate.  Robert Brown leads the cast as Jason Bolt, the oldest of the Bolt brothers.  Bobby Sherman and David Soul got their starts on this show.  The cast also includes Mark Lenard who would go on to play Spock's father on Star Trek. The show's original instrumental theme is interspersed throughout the discs.  That was the only reason I liked the show when I was little.  If you were a fan of the original show this set is a must.At  the time of this writing, the price for the set is still in the low to mid $20s.  Compare that to the $175 to $195 Sony is asking for the Season 1 discs and you have a winner.  The only extras are a halting commentary from an expert on the show.  Some of these are interesting and they don't force you to watch a complete show while people involved with the show ramble on in the background.

1509154,AQLDURX81AGIA,B0063FGG9U,"H. L. Cripe ""cooncat3""","[1, 1]","I don't know why I like this show so much -- it's nothing at all like what I usually watch, if I watch anything at all. I started watching it in the reruns because Mark Lenard was in it and I had always liked him from his appearances in the several iterations of Star Trek. I was even lucky enough to meet him and talk to him and get his autograph while he was still doing the convention circuits.The stories are much better than people realize. They are consistently good with very different twists just where you expect cliches. True, there are a few that get bogged down is corny social justice or the humdrum, but on the whole, they are far better and more imaginative than the junk you see today. Most of the acting is also good, and it's great fun to watch actors on their way up, some in a holding pattern, and a few on their way down. Some of the best and most interesting and durable character actors have good parts in this series. The scenery is gorgeous and the show is very pretty to watch. Sure, nobody in pioneer Seattle had such beautiful clean clothes, such perfect teeth, and so much hair done in such complicated styles (some of which doesn't match what shows of the the actresses' real hair color). The show's child actors are also very pleasant and refreshing, not the usual mouthy brats showing off and trying to run things. They do sometimes get into trouble, but rather quietly and according to deductions and logic that make sense to them.The only faults I see with the series are the way the characters of Biddie Cloom and Captain Clancy are handled. Biddie is a comic character, and in several places the writers almost give her a brain, then lapse back into dumb actions and an irritating giggle. Skillful writing could have kept the comic aspects of the character but made her a real person, and the actress was certainly up to creating that kind of character. I can't, however, forgive anybody for Captain Clancy, with his drunk act and overdone fake Irish accent. Nobody as stupid as Clancy could have managed a rowboat, let alone a voyage around the treacherous tip of South America. And no class act like Lottie the saloon owner could possibly have tolerated such a clod for five minutes. Clancy, like Biddie, had the potential for being a very strong character instead of a travesty, and I can't tell whether it was the fault of the writers or the actor -- probably some of both.I am glad that both seasons of this show are now available on DVDs. As I said before, I don't exactly know why I like it so much, but I do -- it's one of those shows combining good stories, good acting, action, comedy, emotion, and visual delight that is always a pleasure to watch. And I can always turn down the volume when I can't stand Captain Clancy any longer.",4,Season Two At Last!,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,2779,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'nothing', 'what', 'usually', 'watch', 'watch', 'anything', 'started', 'watching', 'reruns', 'Mark', 'Lenard', 'was', 'had', 'always', 'liked', 'appearances', 'several', 'iterations', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'even', 'lucky', 'enough', 'meet', 'talk', 'get', 'autograph', 'was', 'still', 'doing', 'convention', 'circuits.The', 'stories', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'people', 'realize', 'are', 'consistently', 'good', 'very', 'different', 'twists', 'just', 'where', 'expect', 'cliches', 'True', 'are', 'few', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'corny', 'social', 'justice', 'humdrum', 'whole', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'imaginative', 'junk', 'see', 'today', 'Most', 'acting', 'also', 'good', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'actors', 'way', 'up', 'holding', 'pattern', 'few', 'way', 'down', 'best', 'most', 'interesting', 'durable', 'character', 'actors', 'have', 'good', 'parts', 'series', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'show', 'very', 'pretty', 'watch', 'Sure', 'nobody', 'pioneer', 'Seattle', 'had', 'such', 'beautiful', 'clean', 'clothes', 'such', 'perfect', 'teeth', 'so', 'much', 'hair', 'done', 'such', 'complicated', 'styles', ""n't"", 'match', 'what', 'actresses', 'real', 'hair', 'color', 'show', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'pleasant', 'refreshing', 'not', 'usual', 'mouthy', 'brats', 'showing', 'off', 'trying', 'run', 'things', 'do', 'sometimes', 'get', 'trouble', 'rather', 'quietly', 'according', 'deductions', 'logic', 'make', 'sense', 'them.The', 'only', 'faults', 'see', 'series', 'are', 'way', 'characters', 'Biddie', 'Cloom', 'Captain', 'Clancy', 'are', 'handled', 'Biddie', 'comic', 'character', 'several', 'places', 'writers', 'almost', 'give', 'brain', 'then', 'lapse', 'back', 'dumb', 'actions', 'irritating', 'giggle', 'Skillful', 'writing', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'comic', 'aspects', 'character', 'made', 'real', 'person', 'actress', 'was', 'certainly', 'up', 'creating', 'kind', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'however', 'forgive', 'anybody', 'Captain', 'Clancy', 'drunk', 'act', 'overdone', 'fake', 'Irish', 'accent', 'Nobody', 'as', 'stupid', 'Clancy', 'could', 'have', 'managed', 'rowboat', 'let', 'alone', 'voyage', 'treacherous', 'tip', 'South', 'America', 'class', 'act', 'Lottie', 'saloon', 'owner', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'tolerated', 'clod', 'five', 'minutes', 'Clancy', 'Biddie', 'had', 'potential', 'being', 'very', 'strong', 'character', 'instead', 'travesty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'fault', 'writers', 'actor', 'probably', 'both.I', 'am', 'glad', 'seasons', 'show', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'DVDs', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'know', 'why', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'do', 'one', 'shows', 'combining', 'good', 'stories', 'good', 'acting', 'action', 'comedy', 'emotion', 'visual', 'delight', 'always', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'can', 'always', 'turn', 'down', 'volume', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Captain', 'Clancy', 'longer']",Here Come The Brides: Season 2

And waited and waited and waited.  Finally, years after almost every one had completely given up hope comes the exciting news that Shout Factory was planning to release this season on DVD in early 2012!!!  Fans of BRIDES are thrilled and here's hoping this DVD set becomes one of the biggest sellers in Shout Factory's history!!This superb program was never a blockbuster hit but has had a devoted following of fans since day one for it's unique blend of comedy and drama in a western setting.  The cast is superb headed by Robert Brown who is fantastic as the dashing, salt-of-the-earth Jason Bolt who is something of a father figure figure to his younger brothers Joshua (David Soul, several years before STARSKY AND HUTCH) and Jeremy (Bobby Sherman, then at the peak of his teen idol fame).  Joan Blondell is a delight as Lottie who runs the local saloon yet is something of a den mother to the hundred prospective brides the Bolts have brought into Seattle.  Miss Blondell was Emmy nominated for Best Actress both years of the show's run and this program was one of the highlights of her nearly 50-year Hollywood career.  Mark Leonard as the frequently villainous Aaron Stemple and Bridget Hanley as Jeremy's girlfriend Candy add much as well to the series as do several actors in semi-regular roles.I'm hoping there are some nice extras in this set - maybe a few other tv appearances by cast members - but if it comes with nothing beyond every episode of season two that's more than enough to give this set five stars - HERE COME THE BRIDES home at last!!",5,After a Six Year Wait - HERE COME THE BRIDES!!!!,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,1743,"['Fans', 'series', 'HERE', 'COME', 'THE', 'BRIDES', 'were', 'thrilled', 'when', 'Sony', 'released', 'first', 'season', 'unique', 'program', 'back', '2006', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'second', 'final', 'season', 'DVD', 'waited', 'waited', 'waited', 'Finally', 'years', 'almost', 'one', 'had', 'completely', 'given', 'up', 'hope', 'exciting', 'news', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'was', 'planning', 'release', 'season', 'DVD', 'early', '2012', 'Fans', 'BRIDES', 'are', 'thrilled', 'here', 'hoping', 'DVD', 'set', 'one', 'biggest', 'sellers', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'history', 'superb', 'program', 'was', 'never', 'blockbuster', 'hit', 'had', 'devoted', 'following', 'fans', 'day', 'one', 'unique', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama', 'western', 'setting', 'cast', 'superb', 'headed', 'Robert', 'Brown', 'who', 'fantastic', 'dashing', 'salt-of-the-earth', 'Jason', 'Bolt', 'who', 'something', 'father', 'figure', 'figure', 'younger', 'brothers', 'Joshua', 'David', 'Soul', 'several', 'years', 'STARSKY', 'AND', 'HUTCH', 'Jeremy', 'Bobby', 'Sherman', 'then', 'peak', 'teen', 'idol', 'fame', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'delight', 'Lottie', 'who', 'local', 'saloon', 'yet', 'something', 'den', 'mother', 'hundred', 'prospective', 'Bolts', 'have', 'brought', 'Seattle', 'Miss', 'Blondell', 'was', 'Emmy', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'years', 'show', 'run', 'program', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'nearly', '50-year', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'Mark', 'Leonard', 'frequently', 'villainous', 'Aaron', 'Stemple', 'Bridget', 'Hanley', 'Jeremy', 'girlfriend', 'Candy', 'add', 'much', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'do', 'several', 'actors', 'semi-regular', 'roles.I', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'are', 'nice', 'extras', 'set', 'maybe', 'few', 'other', 'tv', 'appearances', 'cast', 'members', 'nothing', 'episode', 'season', 'two', 'more', 'enough', 'give', 'set', 'five', 'stars', 'HERE', 'COME', 'THE', 'BRIDES', 'home', 'last']",Here Come The Brides: Season 2
