This drama is very quiet at times, the characters only speak when they have something valuable to say, well maybe expect Stewart's character who is sassy and has a sailor's mouth. Anyway, what I like about this film is how real and raw it is. Doug (Gandolfini) and Lois (Leo) play husband and wife who's marriage has been falling apart ever since the death of their teenage daughter Emily. Doug goes on a business trip to New Orleans and that's where he meet's Stewart's character, Mallory who's an underage stripper. Doug takes Mallory under her wing and tries to fix her destructive life but along the way, Doug learns that's not always an easy thing.

1371513,A1Z63FBHYURF19,B003Y5H4W0,A. Garvin,"[2, 4]","This was a very good movie, deserves four stars instead of five if we consider crude language that overpowers the theme, but will give it five because of Melissa Leo. There was too much license with trying to shock our sensibilities with crude and vulgar language; the point is that the main character, Kristen Stewart, is uneducated and has no filters when it comes to language and I felt that the language detracted from the film and suspended empathy for Ms. Stewart's character. Otherwise, this was a great vehicle for James Gandolfini to show that he has the chops to move from the small screen to the big screen and the big screen allows him a breadth of emotion that he cannot as easily display on a television series. He not only moved to the big screen with ease, but he owns it in this film.  Equally brilliant is Melissa Leo who plays his neurotic and damaged wife and her performance is the best in this film: Melissa Leo embodies characters and we forget that she is an actress and this film allows her to soar. Watching her face and her emotions is like watching a palette of her range. Returning to Kristen Stewart's role, the crudity of her language became a character on its own and it overpowered her performance; during one scene in a bathroom where Leo's character attempts to help Ms. Stewart there was an opportunity to allow real tenderness, but the scene is sullied by crude language - the language diminishes the depth of character - and our sympathy is stopped short. Melissa Leo's acting turns this film from a good one to a great one and without giving too much away her scene in the diner is the best in the film.",5,Great Range for Both Gandolfini and Melissa Leo,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,1642,"['was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'consider', 'crude', 'language', 'theme', 'will', 'give', 'five', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'license', 'trying', 'shock', 'sensibilities', 'crude', 'vulgar', 'language', 'point', 'main', 'character', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'uneducated', 'filters', 'when', 'language', 'felt', 'language', 'detracted', 'film', 'suspended', 'empathy', 'Ms.', 'Stewart', 'character', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'great', 'vehicle', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'show', 'chops', 'move', 'small', 'screen', 'big', 'screen', 'big', 'screen', 'breadth', 'emotion', 'can', 'not', 'easily', 'display', 'television', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'moved', 'big', 'screen', 'ease', 'film', 'Equally', 'brilliant', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'who', 'neurotic', 'damaged', 'wife', 'performance', 'best', 'film', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'characters', 'forget', 'actress', 'film', 'soar', 'Watching', 'face', 'emotions', 'watching', 'palette', 'range', 'Returning', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'role', 'crudity', 'language', 'became', 'character', 'own', 'overpowered', 'performance', 'one', 'scene', 'bathroom', 'where', 'Leo', 'character', 'attempts', 'help', 'Ms.', 'Stewart', 'was', 'opportunity', 'allow', 'real', 'tenderness', 'scene', 'sullied', 'crude', 'language', 'language', 'depth', 'character', 'sympathy', 'stopped', 'short', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'acting', 'film', 'good', 'one', 'great', 'one', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'scene', 'diner', 'best', 'film']",Welcome to the Rileys

Lois has become an agoraphobic unable to leave the house, whereas Doug seems to be just numbly going through the motions of work. When Doug discovers, while visiting his daughter's grave, that his wife has already purchased plots for the both of them, it hits him that, as far as his wife is concerned, the two are merely marking time until death.While on a business trip to New Orleans, Doug wanders into a seedy strip club and meets Mallory, a teenage runaway surviving as a stripper and prostitute. The shattered, lost girl brings out Doug's paternal instinct, and he makes a bold decision to stay in New Orleans indefinitely to take care of her. This decision creates enough panic and desperation in Lois to motivate her to finally leave the prison of her house and travel to New Orleans to talk sense into Doug, and in the process Lois develops feelings for the troubled girl as well.The film's director wisely keeps things understated and simple, and plays to the project's greatest strength, which are the three outstanding lead actors. James Gandolfini gives a sensitive, heartbreaking performance, shedding all of the alpha male mannerisms of his Tony Soprano persona. Melissa Leo, like she did in ""Frozen River"", offers a raw, brave portrayal of a desperate, ordinary person. And Kristen Stewart, as she did in ""The Runaways"" proves that, despite her success with the ""Twilight"" franchise, she is really a gifted character actress, and not a bland romantic leading lady. She holds her own with Gandolfini and Leo, and manages to avoid all the clich&eacute;s often associated with similar characters.Like ""Leaving Las Vegas"", ""Welcome to the Rileys"" is a story about the redemptive power of love, even when those involved are broken, flawed, and even hopelessly self-destructive. Although the film's ending may be a bit too neat and tidy for my taste, it did offer an open-endedness that kept the whole film from falling into either of two traps: phony sentiment or bleak nihilism.",4,Purgatory,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,2255,"['1/2', 'Welcome', 'Rileys', 'yet', 'example', 'how', 'film', 'merely', 'decent', 'script', 'can', 'be', 'elevated', 'performances', 'great', 'actors.Doug', 'Lois', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'sort', 'purgatory', 'death', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'almost', 'decade', 'ago', 'Lois', 'become', 'agoraphobic', 'unable', 'leave', 'house', 'whereas', 'Doug', 'be', 'just', 'numbly', 'going', 'motions', 'work', 'When', 'Doug', 'discovers', 'visiting', 'daughter', 'grave', 'wife', 'already', 'purchased', 'plots', 'that', 'as', 'far', 'wife', 'concerned', 'two', 'are', 'merely', 'marking', 'time', 'death.While', 'business', 'trip', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Doug', 'seedy', 'strip', 'club', 'meets', 'Mallory', 'teenage', 'runaway', 'surviving', 'stripper', 'prostitute', 'shattered', 'lost', 'girl', 'brings', 'out', 'Doug', 'paternal', 'instinct', 'bold', 'decision', 'stay', 'New', 'Orleans', 'indefinitely', 'take', 'care', 'decision', 'enough', 'panic', 'desperation', 'Lois', 'motivate', 'finally', 'leave', 'prison', 'house', 'travel', 'New', 'Orleans', 'talk', 'sense', 'Doug', 'process', 'Lois', 'feelings', 'troubled', 'girl', 'well.The', 'film', 'director', 'wisely', 'things', 'understated', 'simple', 'project', 'greatest', 'strength', 'are', 'three', 'outstanding', 'lead', 'actors', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'sensitive', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'shedding', 'alpha', 'male', 'mannerisms', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'persona', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'did', 'Frozen', 'River', 'raw', 'brave', 'portrayal', 'desperate', 'ordinary', 'person', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'did', 'Runaways', 'success', 'Twilight', 'franchise', 'really', 'gifted', 'character', 'actress', 'not', 'bland', 'romantic', 'leading', 'lady', 'own', 'Gandolfini', 'Leo', 'avoid', 'clich', 'eacute', 'often', 'associated', 'similar', 'characters.Like', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Welcome', 'Rileys', 'story', 'redemptive', 'power', 'love', 'even', 'when', 'involved', 'are', 'broken', 'flawed', 'even', 'hopelessly', 'self-destructive', 'film', 'ending', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'neat', 'tidy', 'taste', 'did', 'offer', 'open-endedness', 'kept', 'whole', 'film', 'falling', 'two', 'traps', 'phony', 'sentiment', 'bleak', 'nihilism']",Welcome to the Rileys

Just like real life.Then you meet Kristen Stewart. Man this actress is talented. Every once in a while an actor comes along that can fulfill roles that have been languishing on the shelf... waiting for someone capable of fulfilling the character. Kristen doesn't really ""act"".

It's about when a man named Doug loses his daughter, Emily, & heads on a business trip to New Orleans where he meets a stripper name Mallory (Kristen Stewart). Mallory tries to seduce him but when Doug refuses to have sex with her, he instead accompanies her home & promises to pay her $100 a day to replace her home  if he lets her stay there for a few days. Doug's wife, Louise, eventually shows up in New Orleans to be with her husband where she meets Mallory, who is ALSO the same age as Emily when she died. Lois befriends Mallory as they go out to eat one night, along with shopping & conversations about Emily. Lois & Mallory has a fight one night when Mallory goes out to the club & Lois tries & holds her back. Lois accidently hits Mallory after she asked her something unpleasant, & then an outraged Mallory storms out of the house. The married couple finds her & tries to take her back home, but she ran out the car away from them proclaiming &#34;She's nobody's little girl anymore.&#34; Months later, Mallory calls Doug & tells her she's doing just fine & thanking him for the money he left her. She also apologizes to his wife for the way she acted towards her. Doug tells Mallory he loves her before he got off the phone with her, & Mallory tells him she loves him.

It also serves as the title of this fine little film written by Ken Hixon and directed by Jake Scott that examines how the loss of a 15-year-old daughter Emily in an automobile accident has resulted in the crumbling of the parent's marriage and relationship.  Doug (James Gandolfini) has an affair with younger waitress Vivian (Eisa Davis) while Lois (Melissa Leo) becomes so isolated in her agoraphobic state and psychotropic mediations that she is no longer available to Doug. A crisis occurs when Vivian dies in cardiac arrest and in Doug's honest grief he visits her grave only to find that Lois has unilaterally purchased a headstone with Doug's and Lois' names on it beside the grave of their departed Emily, a fact that enrages Doug.Doug goes to New Orleans on a convention and there encounters stripper/prostitute Mallory (Kristen Stewart), a 16 year old unkempt, foul mouthed runaway from Florida: Mallory sees the kind Doug as a john but Doug's interest is in her plight, not her business offerings. Doug obviously responds to Mallory as though she were his lost daughter, moving into her filthy apartment, trying to improve her view of life.  Doug phones Lois that he is going to stay in New Orleans a while, a message that gives Lois the courage to actually leave her home and drive to New Orleans: during Lois' somewhat comedic trip she stops for food and a strange man comes on to her - something that awakens her self esteem before she reaches New Orleans. Once Lois arrives at her destination she is proud of overcoming her agoraphobia and Doug is happy to see the healing Lois.  Together they stay with Mallory, facing the fact that for both of them Mallory represents the chance to restore their love for the daughter they've lost.  How the three cope is the remaining of the film.The three leads offer polished performances - some of the finest work we have seen from both Gandolfini and Leo who together make this film better than the sum of its parts.  Kristen Stewart immerses herself in Mallory and though she still remains a rather monochromatic actress, this role offers her the ability to stretch her acting chops: she is convincing as the victim of the dregs of society and makes us care about a character who seems to have few redeeming qualities.  This trio of actors plays well as a small ensemble and the result is a film that has been far too overlooked by the general public.  Recommended.

While they still live under the same roof, one is having and affair that ends with the significant other dying, and the other won't leave the house out of a fear that developed after the loss of their child.

But there's a reason for his wife's frigidity and her desperately lonely pill taking - not to mention Doug's quiet sobbing in the garage with a cigarette in the dark. Both Doug and Lois lost their 15-year old daughter Emily in an avoidable car accident in 2001 - and with unspoken hurt and unallocated blame - have been escalating damaged goods ever since. But when Vivien his diner-lover of 4 years dies (a subtle performance by Eisa Davis) and Doug goes on a business holiday to New Orleans - he gets more than he bargained for when he goes upstairs with a 17-year old pole dancer and hooker. And this is where the real story begins...The acting in ""Welcome To The Rileys"" is top class and goes a long to forgiving the largely terrible picture quality (a lot of night shots with little or no clarity). First up is a magnificent turn by Gandolfini. In what could have been such a pervy role, he lends his big-bruiser Doug a good-man's gravitas that is wholly believable. Melissa Leo gets the toughest role - and she eats it up with a performance that keeps you glued. And then there's the talented and beautiful Kristen - her jumpy malnourished creation is all spotty skin, blurred eye shadow and bruised limbs. Mallory has been dumped on all of her life - and her street-fighting cornered-rat mistrust of everything takes some breaking through. But Doug is determined - and so is his wife - who comes after Doug and has to make some major life-adjustments herself. All three have been rightly applauded for their work in this...Ok - ""Welcome To The Rileys"" is perhaps a little implausible at times - but the writing and the storytelling will slowburn their way into your heart. And it has an ending that isn't pat - despite the huge pressure there must have been on Jake Scott to deliver just that - happy families all the way...A bit of an overlooked gem frankly.

1371544,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B003Y5H4W0,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[8, 8]","Welcome to The Rileys drew me in more and more as the movie progressed; at first I thought it was a bit too slow but when the pace picked up with the backdrop of New Orleans I was rather impressed by what it had to say. The casting couldn't have been better; Melissa Leo gives an outstanding performance as a guilty housewife punishing herself for a long-ago car accident that took her daughter's life; and James Gandolfini  turns in a masterful performance as her husband Doug who just can't seem to get past his grief and personal demons. The choreography and the cinematography enhance the movie and the musical score does a great job of making the film even better, too.Lois Riley (Melissa Leo) and her husband Doug (James Gandolfini) are still most unhappy even though it's been eight years since the death of their daughter in a car accident. Lois hasn't left the house since the car accident; indeed, Lois has been so depressed that she already has headstones for her and Doug next to their late daughter's grave, a fact that gives Doug the creeps. Doug also has a long standing affair with a waitress named Vivian (Eisa Davis). However, when Vivian suddenly dies of a heart attack Doug is very upset and sadder still; and he suffers in silence because he doesn't know that Lois knew about him and Vivian for quite some while already.Doug goes to a business convention in New Orleans; and being still upset about Vivian's death (he had wanted to take her there for her birthday) and also feeling out of place in a city very different from where he lives with his wife, Doug leaves the convention early one day and wanders into a strip joint where he meets an underage call girl who goes by several different names including Mallory (Kristen Stewart of ""Twilight"" fame). Doug and Mallory begin a most unconventional relationship; she reminds Doug of his daughter. So, what does Doug do? He phones Lois to tell her he's staying in New Orleans indefinitely without giving Lois any reason; he moves in with Mallory paying her $100 a day to stay with her in her very rundown apartment in a home that was abandoned after Hurricane Katrina and Doug tries desperately to get Mallory to grow up with a combination of love and confrontation that Mallory needs.Meanwhile, Lois decides to finally leave their home after nearly eight years of staying indoors--she's determined to drive to New Orleans and find Doug there by calling him on his cell phone. Of course, the rest of what transpires gives us a very solid story line and some fine entertainment.I could tell you more; but there won't be any spoilers here even though it may seem like I've told you much too much already! Suffice it to say the rest of the plot should hold your attention very well. In addition, look for very good performances by Tiffany Coty as Tara and Lance E. Nichols in an all-too-brief appearance as Hamilton 'Ham' Watkins, another businessman at the convention.The DVD also comes with an extra about the making of the film.I recommend this film for anyone interested in gritty family drama or drama in general; and of course fans of the actors in this movie would do well to add this to their collections.",4,"not perfect, but solid performances and that New Orleans backdrop make for a rather good movie",1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,3182,"['Welcome', 'Rileys', 'drew', 'more', 'more', 'movie', 'progressed', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'slow', 'when', 'pace', 'picked', 'up', 'backdrop', 'New', 'Orleans', 'was', 'rather', 'impressed', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'casting', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'guilty', 'housewife', 'punishing', 'long-ago', 'car', 'accident', 'took', 'daughter', 'life', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'masterful', 'performance', 'husband', 'Doug', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'grief', 'personal', 'demons', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'enhance', 'movie', 'musical', 'score', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'too.Lois', 'Riley', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'husband', 'Doug', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'are', 'still', 'most', 'unhappy', 'even', 'been', 'eight', 'years', 'death', 'daughter', 'car', 'accident', 'Lois', ""n't"", 'left', 'house', 'car', 'accident', 'indeed', 'Lois', 'been', 'so', 'depressed', 'already', 'headstones', 'Doug', 'next', 'late', 'daughter', 'grave', 'fact', 'Doug', 'creeps', 'Doug', 'also', 'long', 'standing', 'affair', 'waitress', 'named', 'Vivian', 'Eisa', 'Davis', 'However', 'when', 'Vivian', 'suddenly', 'heart', 'attack', 'Doug', 'very', 'upset', 'sadder', 'still', 'silence', ""n't"", 'know', 'Lois', 'knew', 'Vivian', 'quite', 'already.Doug', 'business', 'convention', 'New', 'Orleans', 'being', 'still', 'upset', 'Vivian', 'death', 'had', 'wanted', 'take', 'birthday', 'also', 'feeling', 'place', 'city', 'very', 'different', 'where', 'wife', 'Doug', 'convention', 'early', 'one', 'day', 'wanders', 'strip', 'joint', 'where', 'underage', 'call', 'girl', 'who', 'several', 'different', 'names', 'including', 'Mallory', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Twilight', 'fame', 'Doug', 'Mallory', 'begin', 'most', 'unconventional', 'relationship', 'Doug', 'daughter', 'So', 'what', 'Doug', 'do', 'Lois', 'tell', 'staying', 'New', 'Orleans', 'indefinitely', 'giving', 'Lois', 'reason', 'Mallory', 'paying', '100', 'day', 'stay', 'very', 'rundown', 'apartment', 'home', 'was', 'abandoned', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'Doug', 'desperately', 'get', 'Mallory', 'grow', 'up', 'combination', 'love', 'confrontation', 'Mallory', 'needs.Meanwhile', 'Lois', 'finally', 'leave', 'home', 'nearly', 'eight', 'years', 'staying', 'indoors', 'determined', 'drive', 'New', 'Orleans', 'find', 'Doug', 'calling', 'cell', 'phone', 'course', 'rest', 'what', 'very', 'solid', 'story', 'line', 'fine', 'entertainment.I', 'could', 'tell', 'more', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'spoilers', 'here', 'even', 'may', 'seem', ""'ve"", 'told', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'already', 'Suffice', 'say', 'rest', 'plot', 'should', 'hold', 'attention', 'very', 'well', 'addition', 'look', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'Tiffany', 'Coty', 'Tara', 'Lance', 'E.', 'Nichols', 'all-too-brief', 'appearance', 'Hamilton', ""'Ham"", 'Watkins', 'businessman', 'convention.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'extra', 'making', 'film.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'interested', 'gritty', 'family', 'drama', 'drama', 'general', 'course', 'fans', 'actors', 'movie', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'add', 'collections']",Welcome to the Rileys

In fact, I think she has no talent and is not even attractive. However, I have to admit that she did a good acting job in this movie and managed to be fairly attractive!  In my opinion, this is the first movie that Kristen Stewart acted well in.  Of course, the other actors in this movie are experienced professionals and are brilliant!  The movies premise is wonderful. This movie is also well-written. It's thought provoking and deals with serious issues without depressing you!  Not an easy feat!  It's a very well done movie!  Very entertaining and enjoyable! It's a true pure movie!",5,Excellent movie!,1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,678,"['excellent', 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'written', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'fact', 'think', 'talent', 'not', 'even', 'attractive', 'However', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'good', 'acting', 'job', 'movie', 'managed', 'be', 'fairly', 'attractive', 'opinion', 'first', 'movie', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'acted', 'well', 'course', 'other', 'actors', 'movie', 'are', 'experienced', 'professionals', 'are', 'brilliant', 'movies', 'premise', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'also', 'well-written', 'thought', 'provoking', 'deals', 'serious', 'issues', 'depressing', 'Not', 'easy', 'feat', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'true', 'pure', 'movie']",Welcome to the Rileys
