She wrote, directed and stars in it and she's great. She did a great job of addressing the stereotypes that Asian Americans face, and the plight of poor people, too. As this style of mistaken identity plot goes, this is a really nice treatment.My main recommendation, though, is that it's a must see for Gale Harold fans. Gale isn't exactly a household word, but he's got an avid and loyal fan base who go to rather extreme lengths to see his movies, up to and including tracking down the producers and lobbying for distribution. Until now, Gale's movies tended to be very dark, laden with violent deaths, emotionally tense story lines and exceedingly unhappy endings. I'm sure they were great parts for an actor who takes his craft seriously, but for a fan that just wants to revel in the work of their favorite actor, they weren't exactly films you could share with your family, watch with your uninitiated friends or just enjoy over and over. This goes at the top of my list of Chick Flicks I'll watch dozens of times, and yes, that's a very good thing. It's such a relief to see Gale using his considerable comedic skills for a change!There are also interesting appearances by Stephanie March, her husband Bobby Flay, Margaret Cho, Christine Baranski, B.D. Wong and Lewis Black, all of whom are perfectly cast for their particular roles.Highly recommended for lovers of romantic comedies.

The main story is about a Chinese American woman, Grace, that lies about her identify to get into this high class committee. Then, she meets this white guy, Andrew, two times his white girlfriend for Grace. That's right. Grace doesn't know he already dating someone and what's worse is that the couple was about to get married too. (Otherwise, if Grace would had know this, you think really Grace would had gone out with him? No way. Unless, she wanted drama with him. But, what do you think?)Eventually, the truth about Grace's identify comes out and Andrew leaves Grace. (And, Andrew wasn't being truthful to her either.) Then, Andrews gets back with original girlfriend. (It was that simple for him to do that. His girlfriend never knew that he cheater on her in the first place with Grace. WOW!) The whole story should had just ended there, but it didn't.At this point, both women still don't know, Andrew playing two different women. (Amazing skills man. What a player.)The Andrew, the cheater, should had stopped while he was ahead, but he doesn't stop. He wants to go the distance. (Okay. Why not? lol) He goes running back to Grace and supposedly dumps his original girlfriend for Grace. (But we don't actually know that. We never actual see that in the movie. He never actually dumps his girlfriend. It doesn't show it. I mean both women don't know about each other still. Nope. Never happened. Andrew could actually be keeping his girlfriend on the sidelines still for awhile longer. Nice!)Then, it shows that he actually decides to marry Grace in a photo.
