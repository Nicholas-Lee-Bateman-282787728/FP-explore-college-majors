There is adequate explanation, but not too much to distract you from relaxation. There is good instruction on breathing and muscle strengthening. The atmosphere is beautiful and calming, so is the music. I like Desi's approach: its friendly and peaceful without being too crunchy and spacey. Its the perfect balance of upbeat and calming. At first I was just going to borrow it from our library, but I decided on buying it and using it at home in place of a physical yoga class.",5,Great Prenatal DVD,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,610,"['second', 'pregnancy', 'have', 'used', 'prenatal', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'love', 'mood', 'instructions', 'postures', 'DVD', 'adequate', 'explanation', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'distract', 'relaxation', 'good', 'instruction', 'breathing', 'muscle', 'strengthening', 'atmosphere', 'beautiful', 'calming', 'so', 'music', 'like', 'Desi', 'approach', 'friendly', 'peaceful', 'being', 'too', 'crunchy', 'spacey', 'perfect', 'balance', 'upbeat', 'calming', 'first', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'borrow', 'library', 'decided', 'buying', 'using', 'home', 'place', 'physical', 'yoga', 'class']",Prenatal Yoga with Desi Bartlett

I have been using it through my 2nd and 3rd trimesters. I used to find Desi's voice a little distracting but now I'm used to it. I like the standing poses, and feel like I get a good stretch by the end.",4,Enjoyable,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,299,"['Overall', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'more', 'relaxing', 'challenging', 'good', 'thing', 'days', 'have', 'been', 'using', '2nd', '3rd', 'trimesters', 'used', 'find', 'Desi', 'voice', 'little', 'distracting', 'now', ""'m"", 'used', 'standing', 'poses', 'feel', 'get', 'good', 'stretch', 'end']",Prenatal Yoga with Desi Bartlett
1221737,A2TCWRKFDUYL9D,B001O4C6JE,"Emily J. Fuller ""Mug""","[0, 0]","This is my first pregnancy and I spent the first four months super ill and tired.  I was a little bit into home DVD yoga before (still a novice for sure) and when I was finally ready to move a bit (around week 23) but still didn't have a ton of energy this was the PERFECT DVD to help get back into a fitness routine.  This routine gives you plenty of energy and only takes 45 minutes, the DVD also has the ability to break out the workout into smaller portions if you only have a moment, or only want to meditate.  The poses and flows are perfect for beginners, but would also work great for those who have been in to yoga for a while and just need to move a bit while pregnant.I highly recommend this.My only criticism, if you can even call it that, is the music in the background - it can be a bit much at times, so I've started just turning the volume down.  Totally NOT a deal breaker.  The routine says it requiresd a blanket and yoga blocks, but I just skip the one move that requires the blocks - you won't miss anything.",5,Excellent When You're Finally Feeling Up to a Little Working Out,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,1029,"['first', 'pregnancy', 'spent', 'first', 'four', 'months', 'super', 'ill', 'tired', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'home', 'DVD', 'yoga', 'still', 'novice', 'sure', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'ready', 'move', 'bit', 'week', '23', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'ton', 'energy', 'was', 'PERFECT', 'DVD', 'help', 'get', 'back', 'fitness', 'routine', 'routine', 'plenty', 'energy', 'only', '45', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'also', 'ability', 'break', 'out', 'workout', 'smaller', 'portions', 'only', 'have', 'moment', 'only', 'want', 'meditate', 'poses', 'flows', 'are', 'perfect', 'beginners', 'would', 'also', 'work', 'great', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'yoga', 'while', 'just', 'need', 'move', 'bit', 'pregnant.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'this.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'can', 'even', 'call', 'music', 'background', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'times', ""'ve"", 'started', 'just', 'turning', 'volume', 'down', 'Totally', 'NOT', 'deal', 'breaker', 'routine', 'blanket', 'yoga', 'blocks', 'just', 'skip', 'one', 'move', 'blocks', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything']",Prenatal Yoga with Desi Bartlett

The actual content of the video isn't my favorite. This was my first pre-natal yoga session and I like that it is divided into sections, but I don't find that I care for Desi Bartlett all that much - I find myself wondering how experienced she is. I have been a fan of Rodney Yee for years and I trust his Giaim videos and prefer them to most others. However, a quick search for pre-natal yoga on YouTube returned results that I have used over and over again compared to the handful of times I have done this video. I would advise you to save your money and try Katie Appleton's 10 minute pre-natal yoga sessions on YouTube first.",3,Okay Basic/Beginner Yoga,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,771,"['downloaded', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Prime', 'Video', 'quality', 'okay', 'not', 'superior', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'actual', 'content', 'video', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'was', 'first', 'pre-natal', 'yoga', 'session', 'like', 'divided', 'sections', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'care', 'Desi', 'Bartlett', 'that', 'much', 'find', 'wondering', 'how', 'experienced', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'years', 'trust', 'Giaim', 'videos', 'prefer', 'most', 'others', 'However', 'quick', 'search', 'pre-natal', 'yoga', 'YouTube', 'returned', 'results', 'have', 'used', 'over', 'again', 'compared', 'handful', 'times', 'have', 'done', 'video', 'would', 'advise', 'save', 'money', 'try', 'Katie', 'Appleton', '10', 'minute', 'pre-natal', 'yoga', 'sessions', 'YouTube', 'first']",Prenatal Yoga with Desi Bartlett

First, it starts with a nice, calming meditation, and overall, the whole DVD flows at a calm pace. Even though it is calming, I still broke a sweat! The standing routine was challenging for me!
