It is great that there are different types of love portrayed in this film: heterosexual and homosexual because both groups can watch it. I love that Keanu Reeves's character and Charlize Theron's character have great chemistry. I find Charlize's character amazing because she loves life. She's a huge believer in living life to the fullest. Unfortunately, she has a sickness that limits her lifestyle. I love how they use San Francisco as a background for one of their scenes. It made me nostalgic and there are some nice songs in this movie. Charlize's character is a bit peculiar, but this is great. It made me want to know more about her character. I love that Keanu's character chose to stay with her after he discovered that she had an illness. The gay guys are amazing. The ending of this film is not great, but it's realistic in the sense that these things happen in real life.",5,A Wonderful Film About Love With A Not-So-Great End,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,948,"['movie', 'love', 'friendship', 'universal', 'subject', 'great', 'are', 'different', 'types', 'love', 'portrayed', 'film', 'heterosexual', 'homosexual', 'groups', 'can', 'watch', 'love', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'character', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'character', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'find', 'Charlize', 'character', 'amazing', 'life', 'huge', 'believer', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'Unfortunately', 'sickness', 'lifestyle', 'love', 'how', 'use', 'San', 'Francisco', 'background', 'one', 'scenes', 'made', 'nostalgic', 'are', 'nice', 'songs', 'movie', 'Charlize', 'character', 'bit', 'peculiar', 'great', 'made', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'character', 'love', 'Keanu', 'character', 'chose', 'stay', 'discovered', 'had', 'illness', 'gay', 'guys', 'are', 'amazing', 'ending', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'realistic', 'sense', 'things', 'happen', 'real', 'life']",N/A

538297,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXV4,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","I think I can honestly say that `Sweet November' is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It's actually so bad that I'm at a loss for words at really what to say here.  I am truly baffled by all the four and five star reviews, but I'm not here to judge other reviewers, just this atrocious movie.`Sweet November' has the disadvantage of sporting a preposterous story that makes little to no sense and is chuck full of so many clich&eacute;s one may can guess each and every plot point just by reading the film description.  Sara Deever is a sweet single woman who engages in month-long relationships with men in order to help them change their lives for the better.  She shies away from any real commitment because she is very ill and so she makes sure she warns them before agreeing to take them on that they are not allowed to fall in love with her, no matter what.  Her `November' is Nelson Moss, an advertising executive who is a workaholic, devoid of any real life.  After a chance meeting she decides to invite him to live with her so she can `help' him.Yes, it's a ridiculous premise.  No self respecting woman would invite total strangers to come live with them, and no sane male would take her up on the offer.  He may go home for the night, but he's not moving in.I understand that films don't always make sense; they are in fact works of fiction; and if the plot were the only issue I may be compelled to forgive it a little and enjoy what else I can from the film, but the plot is the least of its worries.  There is a major problem with the two stars of this film, especially Reeves, but Theron does little to rectify the problem.  Keanu Reeves is seriously one of the worst actors of our generation.  He has almost no emotional depth and is almost always one-note.  In fact the only role he seemed suited for and actually delivered in was `The Matrix', for it was the only role that required his dry personality.  Here he falls flat and proves uninteresting and ridiculously mechanical.  His performance is laughably bad, nothing honest coming from him in any way.  Theron is better, but she can't rescue the film.  She is charming but her quirkiness tends to be a drawback.  Her character comes off as rather insane instead of interesting.  She is gorgeous, there is no denying that, but pretty is not enough.I honestly thought that this movie was going to be sweet, but I can't stress enough how deceiving the films title really is.  I want to rent the original now, just to see if it is as horrible.  Somehow I doubt that.  I took my ex-girlfriend to see this film when it was first released, thinking that it would be a great date movie, but it proved to be a horrible experience for the both of us, and while I don't blame this movie for our eventual breakup (which happened less than a week later) I do find it slightly ironic and like to joke that this movie was our downfall.  I recently caught this movie on Cable and sat through it, just to see if my feelings for the film were tainted by my feelings for my ex, and their not; the movie is genuinely horrendous.If you want to see something romantic and charming this is not the route to go.  Rent `Love Story' or `The Notebook' or `While You Were Sleeping' instead.",1,This November is anything but sweet...,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,3244,"['think', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'Sweet', 'November', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'actually', 'so', 'bad', ""'m"", 'loss', 'words', 'really', 'what', 'say', 'here', 'am', 'truly', 'baffled', 'four', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'not', 'here', 'judge', 'other', 'reviewers', 'just', 'atrocious', 'movie.', 'Sweet', 'November', 'disadvantage', 'sporting', 'preposterous', 'story', 'little', 'sense', 'chuck', 'full', 'so', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 'one', 'may', 'can', 'guess', 'plot', 'point', 'just', 'reading', 'film', 'description', 'Sara', 'Deever', 'sweet', 'single', 'woman', 'who', 'month-long', 'relationships', 'men', 'order', 'help', 'change', 'lives', 'better', 'away', 'real', 'commitment', 'very', 'ill', 'so', 'sure', 'agreeing', 'take', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'fall', 'love', 'matter', 'what', 'November', 'Nelson', 'Moss', 'advertising', 'executive', 'who', 'workaholic', 'devoid', 'real', 'life', 'chance', 'meeting', 'invite', 'live', 'can', 'help', 'him.Yes', 'ridiculous', 'premise', 'self', 'respecting', 'woman', 'would', 'invite', 'total', 'strangers', 'come', 'live', 'sane', 'male', 'would', 'take', 'up', 'offer', 'may', 'go', 'home', 'night', 'not', 'moving', 'in.I', 'understand', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', 'are', 'fact', 'works', 'fiction', 'plot', 'were', 'only', 'issue', 'may', 'be', 'compelled', 'forgive', 'little', 'enjoy', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'film', 'plot', 'least', 'worries', 'major', 'problem', 'two', 'stars', 'film', 'especially', 'Theron', 'little', 'rectify', 'problem', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'seriously', 'one', 'worst', 'actors', 'generation', 'almost', 'emotional', 'depth', 'almost', 'always', 'one-note', 'fact', 'only', 'role', 'seemed', 'suited', 'actually', 'delivered', 'was', 'Matrix', 'was', 'only', 'role', 'required', 'dry', 'personality', 'Here', 'flat', 'uninteresting', 'ridiculously', 'mechanical', 'performance', 'laughably', 'bad', 'nothing', 'honest', 'coming', 'way', 'Theron', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rescue', 'film', 'charming', 'quirkiness', 'tends', 'be', 'drawback', 'character', 'off', 'rather', 'insane', 'instead', 'interesting', 'gorgeous', 'denying', 'pretty', 'not', 'enough.I', 'honestly', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'sweet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'enough', 'how', 'deceiving', 'films', 'title', 'really', 'want', 'rent', 'original', 'now', 'just', 'see', 'horrible', 'Somehow', 'doubt', 'took', 'ex-girlfriend', 'see', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'date', 'movie', 'proved', 'be', 'horrible', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'movie', 'eventual', 'breakup', 'happened', 'less', 'week', 'later', 'do', 'find', 'slightly', 'ironic', 'joke', 'movie', 'was', 'downfall', 'recently', 'caught', 'movie', 'Cable', 'sat', 'just', 'see', 'feelings', 'film', 'were', 'tainted', 'feelings', 'ex', 'not', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'horrendous.If', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'romantic', 'charming', 'not', 'route', 'go', 'Rent', 'Love', 'Story', 'Notebook', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'instead']",N/A

Charlize Theron gives an excellent lead performance as a free-spirited young woman who unlocks the guarded heart of a cold and selfish advertising executive (Reeves), getting him to leave his job behind and awaken to his real emotions. She shows him the best parts of life and then goes all terminal illness on us--yup, we've all seen it a thousand times before. The spin here is that Theron's performance is so warmhearted that the lesser moments of the film (like all the scenes involving Liam Aiken, a poster child for planned parenthood if ever I've seen one) maybe won't be forgiven but at least they can be cheerfully ignored. Reeves' performance, unfortunately, is so very wooden even by his standards that his scenes without his leading lady will make you turn green (watch the part where he pitches an account to a hot dog company: it's the clearest case I've ever seen of an actor who has absolutely no idea what the scene is about).",4,Surprisingly good romantic goo,1003449600,"10 19, 2001",2001,1006,"['Keanu', 'Reeves', 'movie', 'one', 'actually', 'lot', 'heart', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'excellent', 'lead', 'performance', 'free-spirited', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'guarded', 'heart', 'cold', 'selfish', 'advertising', 'executive', 'Reeves', 'getting', 'leave', 'job', 'awaken', 'real', 'emotions', 'best', 'parts', 'life', 'then', 'terminal', 'illness', 'yup', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thousand', 'times', 'spin', 'here', 'Theron', 'performance', 'so', 'warmhearted', 'lesser', 'moments', 'film', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Liam', 'Aiken', 'poster', 'child', 'planned', 'parenthood', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'maybe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'forgiven', 'least', 'can', 'be', 'cheerfully', 'ignored', 'Reeves', 'performance', 'unfortunately', 'so', 'very', 'wooden', 'even', 'standards', 'scenes', 'leading', 'lady', 'will', 'make', 'turn', 'green', 'watch', 'part', 'where', 'account', 'hot', 'dog', 'company', 'clearest', 'case', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'actor', 'who', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'what', 'scene']",N/A

IMO, the stars of this updated version are more appealing than the  stars of the first version, which I didn't much enjoy.

Much to my surprise, I also saw here that Charlize Theron may have quite a bit more acting ability than most former models do.  I think the two do a very good job with these roles and they kept me watching this film to the end.  If I used letters, I'd probably go with a C+ overall.  What works against them is the script which is way over the top, with a terminally ill woman, Theron, taking on a different man every month, to show him how to value life, something she does not have much more of.  Reeves is the man for November.  The month idea is pretty good fantasy wise.  How many women would turn down a month of Keanu Reeves?  In their heart of hearts, I suspect not many.  The way this illness is handled is preposterous though and the scriptwriters must have spent too much time zoned out in La-La land as opposed to investigating terminal patients as they wound into their story pitch.

538304,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,B00003CXV4,casualsuede,"[2, 2]","Sweet November is one of those movies where cold hard reality doesn't really exist in it's ficticious little world. However, having said that, director Pat O'Connor does his best to create a little bohemian world that is inviting, mainly due to the charisma of the two main leads.Nelson is an ad exec that exists in a world where they are forced to implant a phone to their brain, forgo their personal lives and become ratrace automatons. He meets Sara (in a way that only exists in movies), at the DMV. After getting her accidently kicked out, she starts intruding into his life by telling him about her ""one month"" boyfriend idea, where she takes a lover for one month and improves his life. Nelson, already thinking she is crazy is mortified and justifiable dumps her. Then he is dumped by his girlfriend, but that is just the beginning.Eventually in a presentation to a hot dog company, that would never exist in real life (I could of done a better pitch job...Market Demographic Reports anyone?), he is canned and takes her up on the offer. She teaches him to respect life and take control of it. Of course, it is easy to do such things when you don't need a job to support yourself, which is too easily explained as Sara being a E-commerce guru. I don't need Sara to show me how to live life, I need to win the lottery....There are some plot twists that turn this story into a twisted Pretty Woman/Romeo&juliet; story and it ends on a somber note. I won't go into this because I don't want to give away plot points (even though they were pretty easy to see a mile away).Anyone who lives an existance which is composed of all work, having no friends, hobby or romantic life will find this movie appealing (like me). This is our fantasy, to find an attractive mate that will ""be your slave"", never work, visit beaches and eat good food; but it just will never happen, that's why I see this movie as more of a whimsical fantasy rather than a serious romance. There is nothing that works on the sensible side of my brain. If I came at it for what it is, I would say this is a non-sensical movie that stereotypes 1. Gay men 2. Corporate Executives 3. the Standard Protagonist among others. There are some very hokey points in the movie as well, one which involves very bad singing by Keanu and another which involves 12 lame presents including a dishwasher. Also, the whole setup of finding, serving and improving a person for one month is bizarre and would indicate that Sara needs some major psychological help. Luckily, I kept that part of my brain shut off for this movie.However, I did like the ending, an ending which I wish ""Pretty Women"" had. Too often in these movies, the man changes and the woman falls into his arms, to live happily ever after. This doesn't happen and the way that O'connor ends it provides a much more powerful statement that anything julia roberts and richard gere did in their ""fairytale romance"".Overall, this movie is not bad. While it is overly sentimental and unrealistic, it is lovely to look at (especially the charismatic leads) and does have moments of both serendipity and retrospect that make it worth watching...Rating: C+",3,A romance where real life isn't important,1011830400,"01 24, 2002",2002,3166,"['Sweet', 'November', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'cold', 'hard', 'reality', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', 'ficticious', 'little', 'world', 'However', 'having', 'said', 'director', 'Pat', ""O'Connor"", 'best', 'create', 'little', 'bohemian', 'world', 'inviting', 'mainly', 'due', 'charisma', 'two', 'main', 'leads.Nelson', 'ad', 'exec', 'world', 'where', 'are', 'forced', 'implant', 'phone', 'brain', 'forgo', 'personal', 'lives', 'become', 'ratrace', 'automatons', 'Sara', 'way', 'only', 'exists', 'movies', 'DMV', 'getting', 'accidently', 'kicked', 'out', 'intruding', 'life', 'telling', 'one', 'month', 'boyfriend', 'idea', 'where', 'lover', 'one', 'month', 'life', 'Nelson', 'already', 'thinking', 'crazy', 'mortified', 'justifiable', 'dumps', 'Then', 'dumped', 'girlfriend', 'just', 'beginning.Eventually', 'presentation', 'hot', 'dog', 'company', 'would', 'never', 'exist', 'real', 'life', 'could', 'done', 'better', 'pitch', 'job', 'Market', 'Demographic', 'Reports', 'anyone', 'canned', 'up', 'offer', 'respect', 'life', 'take', 'control', 'course', 'easy', 'do', 'such', 'things', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'job', 'support', 'too', 'easily', 'explained', 'Sara', 'being', 'E-commerce', 'guru', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'Sara', 'show', 'how', 'live', 'life', 'need', 'win', 'lottery', 'are', 'plot', 'twists', 'turn', 'story', 'twisted', 'Pretty', 'Woman/Romeo', 'juliet', 'story', 'somber', 'note', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'points', 'even', 'were', 'pretty', 'easy', 'see', 'mile', 'away', '.Anyone', 'who', 'existance', 'composed', 'work', 'having', 'friends', 'hobby', 'romantic', 'life', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'appealing', 'fantasy', 'find', 'attractive', 'mate', 'will', 'be', 'slave', 'never', 'work', 'visit', 'beaches', 'eat', 'good', 'food', 'just', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'why', 'see', 'movie', 'more', 'whimsical', 'fantasy', 'rather', 'serious', 'romance', 'nothing', 'sensible', 'side', 'brain', 'came', 'what', 'would', 'say', 'non-sensical', 'movie', '1', 'Gay', 'men', '2', 'Corporate', 'Executives', '3.', 'Standard', 'Protagonist', 'others', 'are', 'very', 'hokey', 'points', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'very', 'bad', 'singing', 'Keanu', '12', 'lame', 'presents', 'including', 'dishwasher', 'Also', 'whole', 'setup', 'finding', 'serving', 'improving', 'person', 'one', 'month', 'bizarre', 'would', 'indicate', 'Sara', 'major', 'psychological', 'help', 'Luckily', 'kept', 'part', 'brain', 'shut', 'off', 'movie.However', 'did', 'ending', 'ending', 'wish', 'Pretty', 'Women', 'had', 'Too', 'often', 'movies', 'man', 'changes', 'woman', 'arms', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way', ""O'connor"", 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'statement', 'anything', 'julia', 'roberts', 'richard', 'gere', 'did', 'fairytale', 'romance', '.Overall', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'unrealistic', 'lovely', 'look', 'especially', 'charismatic', 'leads', 'have', 'moments', 'serendipity', 'retrospect', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'Rating', 'C+']",N/A

Litton,"[70, 74]","Charlize Theron brings on her charm, and Keanu Reeves turns in a surprisingly worthy performance in &quot;Sweet November,&quot; a movie that's as light as a fall breeze. Slammed by most critics as a soggy romance with no star chemistry, the movie's premise centers around two people who, through an unlikely series of events, fall in love, though not without hardship.Let it be known, the movie is not that bad. In fact, when put in comparison with movies like &quot;Bounce&quot; and &quot;The Wedding Planner,&quot; &quot;Sweet November&quot; is actually kind of refreshing in it's own little way. Yes, the way in which the two develop their romance is a bit tough to swallow at first, but if you can ignore that and allow their growing relationship to touch your heart, then the movie succeeds on those terms.Keanu Reeves plays Nelson Moss, a man who is all work and no play (when leaving for work one morning, he tells his girlfriend, &quot;I have a life, and I'm late for it&quot;) as a big ad executive. While taking a test at the DMV, he runs into Sara Deever, played by Charlize Theron, who gives him an answer and gets caught cheating. What does Sara do? She milks the situation for everything she can in order to get Nelson to her home.Her offer? To allow him to live in her house for a month, no more, no less, in order to help him get rid of all of his life's stresses and restrictions. She takes it to the extreme, too, giving his clothes to a homeless man, telling him he cannot go to work (he got fired, anyway), and taking him out into the town to show him the ways in which life can be fun.Like any movie relationship, there are complications. Sara is reluctant to reveal anything about her past or her family, or her reasons for taking in a new man each month. All she will reveal is what she does to help each one of them. Near the end, there will come a revelation that will put the stability of their bond in jeopardy.It seems preposterous, but with a movie like this, the events come in such an order that you can forgive these little pitfalls. Their budding romance really does have a kick to it, and despite the outside criticism, Theron and Reeves do have some good onscreen chemistry that lights up the screen in moments and provides for some very touching moments.The film also has a lot of warm-hearted laughs. A scene in which Sara stands outside Nelson's apartment and begins shouting risque comments at people in order to gain his attention will have you chuckling, while her neighbors, two homosexuals who host a dinner party for the four of them in drag, are a riot. And the overall sweet nature of the relationship between the two is something to smile about, as well as shed a few tears over.In one of his better roles, Keanu Reeves is convincingly emotional as Nelson. In the beginning, her perfectly portrays the egotistical attitude and outlook of his character, and then makes a very believable segue to someone who is so in love he is willing to change his whole life. Charlize Theron is, as always, a gem, bringing a touch of warmth and cheerfulness to her role as Sara. Her acting embodies her character with the zest for life needed to sell us on Sara's motives, and Theron captures that completely.While it's not on par with many other romances on the market, &quot;Sweet November&quot; is nowhere near as bad as critics have made it out to be. In fact, it's a charming movie that is very uplifting, due in part to the moving relationship that Reeves and Theron bring to their characters. It met all of my expectations, which were few, but the fact that it met them is enough to recommend the film.",4,"Charming, moving, uplifting, and surprisingly good!",995932800,"07 24, 2001",2001,3641,"['Charlize', 'Theron', 'charm', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'surprisingly', 'worthy', 'performance', 'quot', 'Sweet', 'November', 'quot', 'movie', 'as', 'light', 'fall', 'breeze', 'Slammed', 'most', 'critics', 'soggy', 'romance', 'star', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'premise', 'centers', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'unlikely', 'series', 'events', 'fall', 'love', 'not', 'hardship.Let', 'be', 'known', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'fact', 'when', 'put', 'comparison', 'movies', 'quot', 'Bounce', 'quot', 'quot', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sweet', 'November', 'quot', 'actually', 'kind', 'refreshing', 'own', 'little', 'way', 'Yes', 'way', 'two', 'develop', 'romance', 'bit', 'tough', 'swallow', 'first', 'can', 'ignore', 'allow', 'growing', 'relationship', 'touch', 'heart', 'then', 'movie', 'terms.Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Nelson', 'Moss', 'man', 'who', 'work', 'play', 'when', 'leaving', 'work', 'one', 'morning', 'girlfriend', 'quot', 'have', 'life', ""'m"", 'late', 'quot', 'big', 'ad', 'executive', 'taking', 'test', 'DMV', 'Sara', 'Deever', 'played', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'who', 'answer', 'caught', 'cheating', 'What', 'Sara', 'do', 'milks', 'situation', 'everything', 'can', 'order', 'get', 'Nelson', 'home.Her', 'offer', 'allow', 'live', 'house', 'month', 'more', 'less', 'order', 'help', 'get', 'rid', 'life', 'stresses', 'restrictions', 'extreme', 'too', 'giving', 'clothes', 'homeless', 'man', 'telling', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'work', 'got', 'fired', 'anyway', 'taking', 'out', 'town', 'show', 'ways', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'fun.Like', 'movie', 'relationship', 'are', 'complications', 'Sara', 'reluctant', 'reveal', 'anything', 'past', 'family', 'reasons', 'taking', 'new', 'man', 'month', 'will', 'reveal', 'what', 'help', 'one', 'end', 'will', 'come', 'revelation', 'will', 'put', 'stability', 'bond', 'jeopardy.It', 'preposterous', 'movie', 'events', 'come', 'order', 'can', 'forgive', 'little', 'pitfalls', 'budding', 'romance', 'really', 'have', 'kick', 'outside', 'criticism', 'Theron', 'Reeves', 'do', 'have', 'good', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'up', 'screen', 'moments', 'very', 'touching', 'moments.The', 'film', 'also', 'lot', 'warm-hearted', 'laughs', 'scene', 'Sara', 'outside', 'Nelson', 'apartment', 'shouting', 'risque', 'comments', 'people', 'order', 'gain', 'attention', 'will', 'have', 'chuckling', 'neighbors', 'two', 'homosexuals', 'who', 'host', 'dinner', 'party', 'four', 'drag', 'are', 'riot', 'overall', 'sweet', 'nature', 'relationship', 'two', 'something', 'smile', 'about', 'as', 'well', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'over.In', 'one', 'better', 'roles', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'convincingly', 'emotional', 'Nelson', 'beginning', 'perfectly', 'egotistical', 'attitude', 'outlook', 'character', 'then', 'very', 'believable', 'segue', 'someone', 'who', 'so', 'love', 'willing', 'change', 'whole', 'life', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'always', 'gem', 'bringing', 'touch', 'warmth', 'cheerfulness', 'role', 'Sara', 'acting', 'embodies', 'character', 'zest', 'life', 'needed', 'sell', 'Sara', 'motives', 'Theron', 'completely.While', 'not', 'par', 'many', 'other', 'romances', 'market', 'quot', 'Sweet', 'November', 'quot', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'have', 'made', 'be', 'fact', 'charming', 'movie', 'very', 'uplifting', 'due', 'part', 'moving', 'relationship', 'Theron', 'bring', 'characters', 'met', 'expectations', 'were', 'few', 'fact', 'met', 'enough', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

While at the DMV, he meets a quirky, high spirited girl named Sara (played by Charlize Theron). She offers him the opportunity of devoting herself to him for the month of November if he will give up work (he's already lost his job, so why is this an issue anyway?) so she can &quot;show him life as it should be lived.&quot;  It's supposed to be a platonic relationship, but of course, they sleep together after spending only hours together.

538314,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXV4,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 4]","This lackluster romantic tragedy is a weak treatment of a threadbare storyline, further diminished by spotty acting.  The story is shamelessly familiar.  Boy falls in love with girl who he learns is dying, and he becomes transformed by his love for her as she wastes away.  Kleenex stock rises.Anyone who saw ""Autumn In New York"" with Winona Ryder and Richard Gere, released earlier the same year, probably had an overwhelming sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu watching this film, right down to the season.  This film could very well have been titled ""Autumn in San Francisco"".  It was basically the same film with different topography and local color.  However, while the first was well acted with sensitive and insightful character development, this is just a schmaltzy bouillabaisse of sappiness that is spread broadly but thinly.Keanu Reeves, who should have been perfect for the part, wasn't.  In the beginning of the film, he plays a high powered advertising executive with a presentation that is so forced it can only be described as robotic.  Once he wades back into more familiar waters and settles into the romantic role, he seems to be more comfortable and natural, but he still presents a character that is far to stoic to be endearing.  In contrast, Charlize Theron gives a charming and emotionally compelling performance and single-handedly keeps the film from foundering.  Theron gives her character great range and endows her with a kookiness that belies her depth.  Unfortunately, Reeves is so inert in this film that the romantic chemistry between them is as exciting as last night's dishwater.Director Pat O'Connor (""Inventing the Abbots"") did what he could to enliven the film with some nice location shots around San Francisco and some well assembled romantic montages (that might have crossed the line into the overkill zone).  However, his handling of Reeves was poorly done.  I have seen Reeves give numerous performances that were far better than this.  When a solid actor comes off this uninspired, I put the blame squarely at the feet of the director.  Also, I feel that the character development was sorely lacking, with O'Connor content to present superficial skits rather than delve into anyone's psyche.Though not awful, this film requires a strong cup of coffee or an incredibly sentimental viewer.  I rated it a 5/10.  Anyone who liked Keanu Reeves in films like ""The Matrix"" and ""Speed"" should prepare to deduct a point or two.

Charlize Theron is excellent as usual, but there was something missing from her character, as endearing as she was. The biggest problem is character development. Their characters are literally thrown together. He gives up his life, having lost his job and girlfriend, and decides to live with someone he just met and doesn't even like?

Something else to watch -- Keanu loves motorcyles, and Nelson's office at the ad agency is decorated with photos of motorcycles.

538331,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXV4,Matthew Horner,"[1, 4]","While watching Sweet November it occurred to me that I might be wrong in always blaming Hollywood for its seeming inability to make a decent romantic movie these days. Perhaps, I thought, society has changed so profoundly in the last thirty or forty years that the genre is no longer viable. Some people believe that movies influence society's behavior, but I am inclined to think that they merely reflect our collective points of view at any given time. And, frankly, my dears, I suspect society at large no longer gives a damn about romance. This Sweet November is a remake. The original came out in 1969, back when people still laughed at how material we could be. Now materialism is king. It's the new religious order and demands to be taken with utter seriousness. In such a climate, romance is forced to take a back seat, and I don't mean in a fun way. You'll see what I am talking about as you read on.Nelson is a driven ad agency exec whose current girl friend is about to pack her bags because Nelson is so obsessed with his work that he pays her no attention. He seems to have it all - the lavish loft apartment in a trendy section of San Francisco, a car that costs as much as some people's houses, designer suits, a fat paycheck, and, since he is played by Keanu Reeves, good looks. All of this success has gone to his head, and he's now a spoiled brat on his way to becoming a tyrant. One day he meets the gorgeous Sara [Charlize Theron], a woman with a definitively alternative lifestyle. When she announces that she's chosen him to be her man for the month of November, he blows her off. He rethinks her proposal the day he is deservedly fired. She promises that in the month they are together, she will make a new man of him, one who appreciates the really good aspects of life. When he asks why they'll be together only thirty days, she gives him some silly answer. In truth, Sara has good reason to limit her time in relationships, but she soon finds that Nelson is turning into a man she can't easily let go of, for in him she discovers that most elusive of emotions - love.Reeves and Theron make an attractive couple and exude a good bit of chemistry. Their initial meetings are fairly silly and unconvincing, but once they get serious about each other, they are interesting to watch. I don't normally think of Reeves as a romantic lead, but the casting is appropriate here because Nelson must turn from a jerk into a nice guy. Nice guys are right up Reeve's alley.I suspect the problem with Sweet November is connected to all that materialism we see today. I think it breeds a culture of permanent adolescence. A witty and urbane lead character is rarely seen now. In updating the story, Sweet November's writers created a modern man in Nelson, and that man comes off as childish, petty, vain and egotistical. It's someone we see more and more of in movies. It's hard to root for a someone like that, especially in the first half of the film. It also makes it harder to relate to the woman. You keep wondering why she would fall for a guy like that. If that's all that's available, then romance is truly doomed.",2,Okay remake of an okay movie,1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,3132,"['watching', 'Sweet', 'November', 'occurred', 'might', 'be', 'wrong', 'always', 'blaming', 'Hollywood', 'seeming', 'inability', 'make', 'decent', 'romantic', 'movie', 'days', 'Perhaps', 'thought', 'society', 'changed', 'so', 'profoundly', 'last', 'thirty', 'forty', 'years', 'genre', 'longer', 'viable', 'people', 'believe', 'movies', 'influence', 'society', 'behavior', 'am', 'inclined', 'think', 'merely', 'reflect', 'collective', 'points', 'view', 'given', 'time', 'frankly', 'dears', 'suspect', 'society', 'large', 'longer', 'damn', 'romance', 'Sweet', 'November', 'remake', 'original', 'came', 'out', '1969', 'back', 'when', 'people', 'still', 'laughed', 'how', 'material', 'could', 'be', 'Now', 'materialism', 'king', 'new', 'religious', 'order', 'demands', 'be', 'taken', 'utter', 'seriousness', 'such', 'climate', 'romance', 'forced', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'fun', 'way', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'read', 'driven', 'ad', 'agency', 'exec', 'current', 'girl', 'friend', 'pack', 'bags', 'Nelson', 'so', 'obsessed', 'work', 'attention', 'have', 'lavish', 'loft', 'apartment', 'trendy', 'section', 'San', 'Francisco', 'car', 'as', 'much', 'people', 'houses', 'designer', 'suits', 'fat', 'paycheck', 'played', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'good', 'looks', 'success', 'gone', 'head', 'now', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'way', 'becoming', 'tyrant', 'One', 'day', 'gorgeous', 'Sara', '[', 'Charlize', 'Theron', ']', 'woman', 'definitively', 'alternative', 'lifestyle', 'When', 'chosen', 'be', 'man', 'month', 'November', 'off', 'proposal', 'day', 'deservedly', 'fired', 'month', 'are', 'together', 'will', 'make', 'new', 'man', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'good', 'aspects', 'life', 'When', 'why', ""'ll"", 'be', 'together', 'only', 'thirty', 'days', 'silly', 'answer', 'truth', 'Sara', 'good', 'reason', 'limit', 'time', 'relationships', 'soon', 'Nelson', 'turning', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'easily', 'let', 'go', 'most', 'elusive', 'emotions', 'love.Reeves', 'Theron', 'make', 'attractive', 'couple', 'exude', 'good', 'bit', 'chemistry', 'initial', 'meetings', 'are', 'fairly', 'silly', 'unconvincing', 'once', 'get', 'serious', 'other', 'are', 'interesting', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'think', 'Reeves', 'romantic', 'lead', 'casting', 'appropriate', 'here', 'Nelson', 'must', 'turn', 'jerk', 'nice', 'guy', 'Nice', 'guys', 'are', 'right', 'Reeve', 'alley.I', 'suspect', 'problem', 'Sweet', 'November', 'connected', 'materialism', 'see', 'today', 'think', 'culture', 'permanent', 'adolescence', 'witty', 'urbane', 'lead', 'character', 'rarely', 'seen', 'now', 'updating', 'story', 'Sweet', 'November', 'writers', 'created', 'modern', 'man', 'Nelson', 'man', 'off', 'childish', 'petty', 'vain', 'egotistical', 'someone', 'see', 'more', 'more', 'movies', 'hard', 'root', 'someone', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'also', 'harder', 'relate', 'woman', 'keep', 'wondering', 'why', 'would', 'fall', 'guy', 'available', 'then', 'romance', 'truly', 'doomed']",N/A

It's great to see them starring alongside each other again, after igniting the screen during Devil's Advocate. It's a similar situation to Devil's Advocate, but a different storyline, just extremely similar characters. Keanu and Charlize have a great terrific chemistry, and when you see them behind the scenes in the extras, they seem to get on well together. They're almost the next Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.This isn't really a date film, a film you would go see with your boyfriend, as they would most likely end up slagging off Keanu's performance and then drooling over Charlize. This is a film you would go see with your girlfriends, or sit at home and watch alone, so you don't have to be ashamed of crying!Both actors are great in this film, and both don't really have to stretch themselves much, as they've played these characters in the past. Some people will slag off Keanu's performance, but these people are just jealous.There are a few very nice topless shots of Keanu, showing off his infamous scar on his torso and since it was around the same time as Matrix, he's still very much muscular and bulked up - gorgeous. Although not quite as bulked up as he was for Speed, just lots of definition.It's not obvious to start with that Sarah (Charlize's character) is ill - sorry to spoil it, but if you've heard about this film, you'll know it's a tearjerker. She seems scatterbrained, and extremely dizzy, and likes dogs. As the film progresses, you notice little bits and pieces, and her face looking more and more drawn, before it gets discovered, by Nelson (Keanu's character). This film must have been hard for Keanu to film, as it's about cancer and a terminal illness. Any Keanu fan will know one of his sisters has had cancer on and off for the past few years, and although she was in remission, the cancer reappeared around the time of the Matrix films. So this film may have hit a chord with Keanu, he probably would have agreed to do it, just because of that, and not because it's a big Hollywood blockbuster.The brilliant Enya backs some of the most romantic and poignant scenes in the film, and it really sets the tone of the film. I used to be a fan of hers when I was young, as the music is so peaceful and always makes me teary.

I was untouched by Sara's and Nelson's (Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves) romantic interlude.Sara's and Nelson's relationship starts off with them being at odds with each other and then it,eventually, develops into one of friendship and love. Charlize's character is that of a dying woman who is trying to live the last of her days by developing a relationship with a man a month and then sending them on their way. She does not want Nelson to be a part of her dying because she wants him to remember their relationship( and her) as one that was beautiful and happy. I did not find that to be touching. I saw it as an act of selfishness and unbelievable. Keanu Reeves' character ( Nelson) was one of a high strung, uptight, money making executive who later adapts the unconventional, bohemian lifestyle of Sara's out of love for her. I found Reeves to be out of his element as an actor, and his performance as a romantic fell flat. In her efforts to portray a free-spirited, uninhibited, happy-go-lucky person,Theron comes across as silly and extremely irritating. Her character is unbelievable as she gives Nelson's expensive clothes to a homeless guy and gives Nelson less expensive casual duds that belong to her gay friend. In my opinion, I feel that Reeves and Theron both did a poor job of portraying their characters, and I simple disliked the movie. I gave the movie  2 stars, only, because I find Keanu Reeves to be very handsome, and I enjoy looking at him. There was nothing else about this movie that I liked.

I recommend you just look at the ratings given, then buy this DVD and see for yourself.  Yes, its an oft-times manipulative romance, clumsily executed.  But its heart is in the right place, and it has much to say about modern city life.  In mannerisms, costumes, and decor, the filmmakers reinforce the notion that the intense competitiveness of modern urban life, which worships the 'top dog' above all others, snuffs out any sense of our connectedness to one another, our need to nurture and be nurtured.  That need is perhaps only recognized once again when it is almost literally too late.  It would seem to be too late for Nelson Moss, the hard-driving ad executive, but he hasn't yet met Sara Deever, who somehow knows otherwise.  This movie transcends its genre through the star quality of its two main actors, Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves, and through the last 10 minutes of film.  A city is full of walls, and the highest are spiritual.  She encourages him to drop his guard, but can she drop hers? To nurture and be nurtured you have to drop your guard, revealing that you're really just feeling your way along in life, as if blindfolded.

Or, to put it mildly, she takes a new lover every month. Nelson (Keanu Reeves) is, at the start of the film, obsessed with one thing...himself. He's selfish, arrogant, and a workaholic. Sara (Charlize Theron) is a free spirit who decides that Nelson needs her ""help.""

The month ends, but Nelson doesn't want the relationship to. He tries his hardest to win Sara over and make her forget about her ""one month only"" rule, but Sara has a secret that forces her to stick to her rule, and it's this secret that is the most devastating to Nelson. Keanu & Charlize are good together, and the film has some tender moments, but the end was a letdown for me. As far as Keanu's role goes, he seemed more comfortable in the role of laid-back nice guy instead of the arrogant person that he started out as. Of course, I will never have anything bad to say about him, as I worship the ground he walks on. Charlize gives a fine performance, as well. Frank Langella has a juicy bit part as a man who is so nasty and cold, it gave me chills, and he must have given Nelson the chills, too, because we see in his eyes a slight change as he sees in Langella what he doesn't want to become.

As I happened upon this movie on cable one night, just as it started, The first 30 minutes, I sat through with a cocked eyebrow, watching Reeves weave his character, Nelson Moss, into life. Then along came Theron, as the quirky, mysterious, wise beyond her years, captivating, and poignant Sara Deever, and after that, I was hooked.Truly, as it is infamously told in the reviews, the last act of the film, to it's end was absolutly heartwrenching. I was just starstruck by Charlize Theron's character in this movie, her performance, everything. I also found that this is actually a REMAKE of the original from the 50's with Sandra Dee. I've yet to see it, but it peaked my interest. Although I doubt it would hold a candle to this version.
