It is perfect for them to watch the show whenever they want or take it in the car.  There is lots of singing and dancing which I love because it gets my boys up and moving.  I mean really how could you not want to dance along?  Its also very energetic since Lance was actually performing it live.",4,Get Up and Move!,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,449,"['were', 'actually', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'Yo', 'Gabba', 'Gabba', 'Party', 'My', 'City', 'when', 'was', 'here', 'Chicago', 'boys', 'still', 'talk', 'perfect', 'watch', 'show', 'whenever', 'want', 'take', 'car', 'lots', 'singing', 'dancing', 'love', 'boys', 'up', 'moving', 'mean', 'really', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'want', 'dance', 'along', 'also', 'very', 'energetic', 'Lance', 'was', 'actually', 'performing', 'live']",Yo Gabba Gabba: There's a Party in My City!

I had seen their television show before and my kids have enjoyed them since they were young. They blend of music and excitement is contagious and the kids thrive on it. This DVD is great and incorporates wonderful music and engages kids in the concert itself. So even if you are not able to attend a live concert you can have a live concert right in your own family room. One word of caution though, the songs are very contagious and by watching us don't be surprised if your kids start singing the songs day in and day out, and before you know it, you will be too. This is a great DVD for the entire family.",5,A Great DVD,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,722,"['have', 'never', 'seen', 'Yo', 'Gabba', 'Gabba', 'live', 'concert', 'when', 'received', 'DVD', 'knew', 'was', 'treat', 'had', 'seen', 'television', 'show', 'kids', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'young', 'blend', 'music', 'excitement', 'contagious', 'kids', 'thrive', 'DVD', 'great', 'wonderful', 'music', 'kids', 'concert', 'So', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'able', 'attend', 'live', 'concert', 'can', 'have', 'live', 'concert', 'right', 'own', 'family', 'room', 'One', 'word', 'caution', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'contagious', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'kids', 'start', 'singing', 'songs', 'day', 'day', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'great', 'DVD', 'entire', 'family']",Yo Gabba Gabba: There's a Party in My City!

Since she seemed to really love the show (not that I'm complaining about it), I thought this would be cool for her to have.The show itself is great, and it was mildly interesting to see how the show had evolved by the time it made its way here (near the end of the tour). For example, there was far less ""Hey Detroit!"" in the show we saw live, while this video has loads of ""Hey Los Angeles!"".Loads of Los Angeles.Guess where everyone is? In Los Angeles, is where.I think it's a touch confusing for kids who aren't in Los Angeles, but you think that's my Midwestern inferiority complex shining though. Okay, fair enough. Here's my real contention: at least a third of the show is cutaways to the audience. And the cutaways aren't the slightest bit graceful or additive to what's happening in the show.For instance, as DJ Lance introduces the other characters, rather than cutting to the characters he's calling out, we get clips of a three year old dancing, or the backs of the characters. It's like someone learning Final Cut has been asked to give three different reels of the same show equal time. It's a mess that makes the live show difficult to follow, which is rather unfortunate considering the live show is mostly rehashed from the Nick Jr. series.""DJ Lance said Biz Markie, but that woman in the audience looks kinda like Gwen Stefani. Is it? Wait never mind, there's Biz...""The three ""behind the scenes"" extras are more cohesive, but even those go from ""engaging to my 4 year-old"" to ""entertaining to me"" and back again in a 10 minute segment.If I had it to do over again, I'd probably have crossed my fingers and hoped for Nick Jr. to run it, or for the disc to be in the Redbox as a one-time rental.",2,I'd skip this one.,1331683200,"03 14, 2012",2012,1828,"['should', 'probably', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'took', 'daughter', 'see', 'show', 'when', 'came', 'Detroit', 'seemed', 'really', 'love', 'show', 'not', ""'m"", 'complaining', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'have.The', 'show', 'great', 'was', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'show', 'had', 'evolved', 'time', 'made', 'way', 'here', 'end', 'tour', 'example', 'was', 'far', 'less', 'Hey', 'Detroit', 'show', 'saw', 'live', 'video', 'loads', 'Hey', 'Los', 'Angeles', '.Loads', 'Los', 'Angeles.Guess', 'where', 'everyone', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where.I', 'think', 'touch', 'confusing', 'kids', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'Los', 'Angeles', 'think', 'Midwestern', 'inferiority', 'complex', 'shining', 'though', 'Okay', 'fair', 'enough', 'Here', 'real', 'contention', 'least', 'third', 'show', 'cutaways', 'audience', 'cutaways', 'are', ""n't"", 'slightest', 'bit', 'graceful', 'additive', 'what', 'happening', 'show.For', 'instance', 'DJ', 'Lance', 'other', 'characters', 'rather', 'cutting', 'characters', 'calling', 'out', 'get', 'clips', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'dancing', 'backs', 'characters', 'someone', 'learning', 'Final', 'Cut', 'been', 'asked', 'give', 'three', 'different', 'reels', 'same', 'show', 'equal', 'time', 'mess', 'live', 'show', 'difficult', 'follow', 'rather', 'unfortunate', 'considering', 'live', 'show', 'mostly', 'rehashed', 'Nick', 'Jr', 'series', 'DJ', 'Lance', 'said', 'Biz', 'Markie', 'woman', 'audience', 'kinda', 'Gwen', 'Stefani', 'Wait', 'never', 'mind', 'Biz', 'three', 'scenes', 'extras', 'are', 'more', 'cohesive', 'even', 'go', 'engaging', '4', 'year-old', 'entertaining', 'back', 'again', '10', 'minute', 'segment.If', 'had', 'do', 'over', 'again', ""'d"", 'probably', 'have', 'crossed', 'fingers', 'hoped', 'Nick', 'Jr.', 'run', 'disc', 'be', 'Redbox', 'one-time', 'rental']",Yo Gabba Gabba: There's a Party in My City!
