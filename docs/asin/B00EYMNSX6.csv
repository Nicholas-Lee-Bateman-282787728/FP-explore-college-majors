1669698,A2YRWE73IZYN0P,B00EYMNSX6,John F. Jamele,"[35, 45]","In 2004, my dream of a Red Sox World Championship came true- and a few months later, I was able to enjoy a recap of the events leading to that magic moment with the official World Series film of that year.  The emotion, the drama, the suspense- everything was there in a job very well done.  Three years later, the Red Sox celebrated another championship, and I was able to celebrate another brilliantly-done World Series DVD.This year, I pre-ordered the WS DVD within days of the Red Sox winning their third title this century, received it on the day of it's release, and watched it immediately.  What a disappointment.First, the 2004 and 2007 versions featured a great deal of coverage concerning the Sox' opponents in the World Series- the Cardinals and the Rockies, respectively.  This year, the National League Champions are almost ignored, as if they are bystanders in the final drama.  But that's a minor quibble compared to the real problem in this DVD- it all comes off as very flat and dull- every interview of the players, coach and execs is from the same angle and same distance from the camera lens, clearly in the same studio and the same background (jeesh, the color of the background couldn't even be changed between interviews?  Couldn't some of the interviews have been held outside at the park, or in the locker room, or ANYWHERE other than a studio in front of the same ugly screen?) It all comes off as very bland and repetitive, and the excitement doesn't come out at all.The clips from the games are generally fine, but the best aren't always selected- I would rather relive what I saw on television than the view from some fan's camcorder in the stands.  Also, I'd rather hear what I heard during the games- the use of several different color guys calling the same shot sounds disjointed and awkward, reminding the viewer that they are watching a DVD compilation, making it more difficult to relive the actual moment (Jumping from regular speed to slow-motion for the same play has the same effect.)  I don't know why they always insist on doing this- when I watch one of these DVDs, I want to imagine as best I can that I am watching the game again.  I don't want to be reminded that I'm watching a film made up of various clips.Also unlike the 2004 and 2007 films, the regular season is barely touched on in this film.  A lot of time (too much, in my opinion) is used reminding us of the Boston Marathon bombing. Yes, it was an important moment, and yes, it had a big impact on the team.  But including so much of it in this DVD clearly meant sacrificing coverage of the season.  One or two minutes on the bombing would have been appropriate- instead, it feels at times like this film is almost as much about the bombing as it is about the Red Sox winning the World Series again.This is a good film- but unlike the 2004 and 2007 DVDs, it is not a GREAT film.  It's really quite dull at times and comes off as hurried and by-the-numbers.  I've watched the previous Sox WS DVDs many times each- I doubt I'll be popping this in the player anywhere near as often.  Come on, MLB- you can do much better than this.  I know, because you did in the past.(Added after several viewings:  The Bonus Chapters include the end of each series, which is done very well, and EVERY World Series hit by David Ortiz.  By itself, the Bonus Chapters probably earn this DVD another star.)",3,Disappointing compared to the 2004 and 2007 versions,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,3391,"['2004', 'dream', 'Red', 'Sox', 'World', 'Championship', 'came', 'true-', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'recap', 'events', 'leading', 'magic', 'moment', 'official', 'World', 'Series', 'film', 'year', 'emotion', 'drama', 'suspense-', 'everything', 'was', 'there', 'job', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Three', 'years', 'later', 'Red', 'Sox', 'celebrated', 'championship', 'was', 'able', 'celebrate', 'brilliantly-done', 'World', 'Series', 'DVD.This', 'year', 'pre-ordered', 'WS', 'DVD', 'days', 'Red', 'Sox', 'winning', 'third', 'title', 'century', 'received', 'day', 'release', 'watched', 'immediately', 'What', 'disappointment.First', '2004', '2007', 'versions', 'featured', 'great', 'deal', 'coverage', 'concerning', 'Sox', 'opponents', 'World', 'Series-', 'Cardinals', 'Rockies', 'respectively', 'year', 'National', 'League', 'Champions', 'are', 'almost', 'ignored', 'are', 'bystanders', 'final', 'drama', 'minor', 'quibble', 'compared', 'real', 'problem', 'DVD-', 'off', 'very', 'flat', 'dull-', 'interview', 'players', 'coach', 'execs', 'same', 'angle', 'same', 'distance', 'camera', 'clearly', 'same', 'studio', 'same', 'background', 'jeesh', 'color', 'background', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'changed', 'interviews', 'Could', ""n't"", 'interviews', 'have', 'been', 'held', 'outside', 'park', 'locker', 'room', 'ANYWHERE', 'other', 'studio', 'front', 'same', 'ugly', 'screen', 'off', 'very', 'bland', 'repetitive', 'excitement', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'all.The', 'clips', 'games', 'are', 'generally', 'fine', 'best', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'selected-', 'would', 'rather', 'relive', 'what', 'saw', 'television', 'view', 'fan', 'camcorder', 'stands', 'Also', ""'d"", 'rather', 'hear', 'what', 'heard', 'games-', 'use', 'several', 'different', 'color', 'guys', 'calling', 'same', 'shot', 'sounds', 'disjointed', 'awkward', 'reminding', 'viewer', 'are', 'watching', 'DVD', 'compilation', 'making', 'more', 'difficult', 'relive', 'actual', 'moment', 'Jumping', 'regular', 'speed', 'slow-motion', 'same', 'play', 'same', 'effect', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'always', 'insist', 'doing', 'this-', 'when', 'watch', 'one', 'DVDs', 'want', 'imagine', 'best', 'can', 'am', 'watching', 'game', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'reminded', ""'m"", 'watching', 'film', 'made', 'various', 'clips.Also', '2004', '2007', 'films', 'regular', 'season', 'barely', 'touched', 'film', 'lot', 'time', 'too', 'much', 'opinion', 'used', 'reminding', 'Boston', 'Marathon', 'bombing', 'Yes', 'was', 'important', 'moment', 'yes', 'had', 'big', 'impact', 'team', 'including', 'so', 'much', 'DVD', 'clearly', 'meant', 'sacrificing', 'coverage', 'season', 'One', 'two', 'minutes', 'bombing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appropriate-', 'instead', 'times', 'film', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'bombing', 'Red', 'Sox', 'winning', 'World', 'Series', 'again.This', 'good', 'film-', '2004', '2007', 'DVDs', 'not', 'GREAT', 'film', 'really', 'quite', 'dull', 'times', 'off', 'hurried', 'by-the-numbers', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'previous', 'Sox', 'WS', 'DVDs', 'many', 'times', 'each-', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'be', 'popping', 'player', 'anywhere', 'as', 'often', 'Come', 'MLB-', 'can', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'know', 'did', 'past', 'Added', 'several', 'viewings', 'Bonus', 'Chapters', 'include', 'end', 'series', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'EVERY', 'World', 'Series', 'hit', 'David', 'Ortiz', 'Bonus', 'Chapters', 'probably', 'earn', 'DVD', 'star']",N/A

(We open a can of B&M;, and have our hot dogs with that)  But after an 86 year lag, the Red Sox won their first 21st century World Series in 2004, and then added some whipped cream to that sweet, sweet moment by winning again in 2007 and 2013.In 2012, they were the bottom ranked team in Major League Baseball. Not so in 2013!  This film gives you all the highlights of their battle to go from &#34;Worst to First.&#34; Watch Papi and the boys play some amazing baseball and cheer them on the whole time.

I'm sure the announcers did a decent job, I just like to watch the boys with people I know or with no one at all.The video is outstanding, and will show you plays from angles you never saw before.
