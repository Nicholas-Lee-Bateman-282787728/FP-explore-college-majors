754204,AUW8TCRK9EDQ6,B00009MEAL,Andre LeBlanc,"[7, 8]","I too was very much looking forward to seeing David Suchet's version of Murder on the Orient Express.  I've never been a big fan of Albert Finney as Poirot.  Suchet's version was disappointing to say the least and doesn't even come close to the award winning Albert Finney version.  I can now understand why authors put clauses in their wills preventing people from carrying on their work.  In this case, somebody came along with a Christian agenda and heavily imposed it on the story line.  Poirot comes across as a cold, self righteous, and judgemental Catholic fanatic.  He is dark and unlikeable.  On top of that the filming comes across as chaotic, featuring choppy cuts and weird angles.  The other actors and actresses in the film were poorly chosen and just don't work well within their roles.  The movie just isn't very enjoyable to watch.I don't think Appointment With Death was as bad as some reviewers have described it, but at the same time it is clearly not one of Suchet's better Poirot films.  The Third Girl is the best of the three movies and is most closely comparable to Suchet's previous work as Poirot.As an unexpected surprise, the set does include a wonderful documentary of David Suchet taking a ride on the Orient Express.  He interviews staff about the train, including its history, and takes the viewer along on every step of his journey (including the meals he ate on board).  It was a real treat to watch.  It's a shame the feature film didn't compare.As an overall assessment, I would only recommend this set for loyal fans who have already purchased all the other Poirot sets (featuring David Suchet).Murder on the Orient Express:  1 star (out of 5)The Third Girl:  3.5 starsAppointment With Death: 3 starsDavid Suchet's Orient Express documentary: 5 stars",3,Somewhat Disappointing,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,1788,"['too', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'David', 'Suchet', 'version', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Poirot', 'Suchet', 'version', 'was', 'disappointing', 'say', 'least', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'award', 'winning', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'version', 'can', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'authors', 'put', 'clauses', 'wills', 'preventing', 'people', 'carrying', 'work', 'case', 'somebody', 'came', 'along', 'Christian', 'agenda', 'heavily', 'imposed', 'story', 'line', 'Poirot', 'across', 'cold', 'righteous', 'judgemental', 'Catholic', 'fanatic', 'dark', 'unlikeable', 'top', 'filming', 'across', 'chaotic', 'featuring', 'choppy', 'cuts', 'weird', 'angles', 'other', 'actors', 'actresses', 'film', 'were', 'poorly', 'chosen', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'roles', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Appointment', 'Death', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'reviewers', 'have', 'described', 'same', 'time', 'clearly', 'not', 'one', 'Suchet', 'better', 'Poirot', 'films', 'Third', 'Girl', 'best', 'three', 'movies', 'most', 'closely', 'comparable', 'Suchet', 'previous', 'work', 'Poirot.As', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'set', 'include', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'David', 'Suchet', 'taking', 'ride', 'Orient', 'Express', 'staff', 'train', 'including', 'history', 'viewer', 'step', 'journey', 'including', 'meals', 'ate', 'board', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'watch', 'shame', 'feature', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'compare.As', 'overall', 'assessment', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'set', 'loyal', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'purchased', 'other', 'Poirot', 'sets', 'featuring', 'David', 'Suchet', '.Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', '1', 'star', '5', 'Third', 'Girl', '3.5', 'starsAppointment', 'Death', '3', 'starsDavid', 'Suchet', 'Orient', 'Express', 'documentary', '5', 'stars']",N/A

Some of her best likeAgatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, andDeath on the Nilehave been made several times with quite impressive casts.  This set includes some very dramatic episodes exquisitely filmed.  The exotic ambiance of the Middle East in both Murder on the Orient Express and Appointment with Death are breath taking.  The experience of the steam train making its way into Yugoslavia and becoming stalled by a snow drift in a mountain wilderness is wonderful.As usual, the events take place in the 1930s.  The dress, hairstyles, makeup and attitudes are period appropriate and subtly create an ambiance for the viewer that is at once familiar and alien, a time of our grandfathers and great grandfathers.  The Third Girl is the only one of the three that has a classic ""manor house"" character, although the confinement of the suspects to one car of the train in Murder on the Orient Express certainly partakes of the idea if not the setting.My favorite is Appointment with Death, partly because I have lived in the Middle East and partly because I know a little about Agatha Christies' life.  The author's second husband was the renowned British archaeologist Sir Maxim Mallowan whom she often accompanied on his expeditions in Egypt, Iraq and Syria.  (In fact, one of the archaeological journals--Antiquity, I think--had a lovely obituary for her in 1976 when she died, probably the only author of murder mysteries ever to be honored in that fashion!)  She was thus able to create fairly accurate locale settings for her mysteries, not only with respect to indigenous culture and to archaeological technique, but as to the interpersonal friction that such endeavors tend to engender.  I once read that Mrs. Mortimer Wheeler was very disliked on her husband's expeditions and that Christie wrote one of her murder mysteries using this as a take-off point.  (For my own experience, while the expedition I was to have joined failed to get funding, I had friends who came back from theirs with ""funny"" stories laced with considerable hostility towards some of the other participants.)All three stories are very dark.  Of the three, Appointment with Death is the darkest, though Murder on the Orient Express (which seems to harken back to the Lindberg kidnapping) is a close second.  Neither is a ""happily ever after"" sort of story.  The Third Girl is somewhat lighter but not much.  The character of Ariadne Oliver, played by Zo Wanamaker the flight instructor and Quidich coach ofHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray], is delightful.  Although she is not quite as I pictured her in the Christie stories, I like Ms Wanamaker's version much better.",4,Dark stories but cinematically stunning.,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,2778,"['enjoyed', 'Agatha', 'Christies', 'works', 'am', 'happy', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'made', 'films', 'best', 'likeAgatha', 'Christie', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'andDeath', 'Nilehave', 'been', 'made', 'several', 'times', 'quite', 'impressive', 'casts', 'set', 'very', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'exquisitely', 'filmed', 'exotic', 'ambiance', 'Middle', 'East', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'Appointment', 'Death', 'are', 'breath', 'taking', 'experience', 'steam', 'train', 'making', 'way', 'Yugoslavia', 'becoming', 'stalled', 'snow', 'drift', 'mountain', 'wilderness', 'wonderful.As', 'usual', 'events', 'take', 'place', '1930s', 'dress', 'hairstyles', 'makeup', 'attitudes', 'are', 'period', 'appropriate', 'subtly', 'create', 'ambiance', 'viewer', 'once', 'familiar', 'alien', 'time', 'grandfathers', 'great', 'grandfathers', 'Third', 'Girl', 'only', 'one', 'three', 'classic', 'manor', 'house', 'character', 'confinement', 'suspects', 'one', 'car', 'train', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'certainly', 'idea', 'not', 'setting.My', 'favorite', 'Appointment', 'Death', 'partly', 'have', 'lived', 'Middle', 'East', 'partly', 'know', 'little', 'Agatha', 'Christies', 'life', 'author', 'second', 'husband', 'was', 'renowned', 'British', 'archaeologist', 'Sir', 'Maxim', 'Mallowan', 'whom', 'often', 'accompanied', 'expeditions', 'Egypt', 'Iraq', 'Syria', 'fact', 'one', 'archaeological', 'journals', 'Antiquity', 'think', 'had', 'lovely', 'obituary', '1976', 'when', 'died', 'probably', 'only', 'author', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'ever', 'be', 'honored', 'fashion', 'was', 'thus', 'able', 'create', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'locale', 'settings', 'mysteries', 'not', 'only', 'respect', 'indigenous', 'culture', 'archaeological', 'technique', 'interpersonal', 'friction', 'such', 'endeavors', 'tend', 'engender', 'once', 'read', 'Mrs.', 'Mortimer', 'Wheeler', 'was', 'very', 'disliked', 'husband', 'expeditions', 'Christie', 'wrote', 'one', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'using', 'take-off', 'point', 'own', 'experience', 'expedition', 'was', 'have', 'joined', 'failed', 'get', 'funding', 'had', 'friends', 'who', 'came', 'back', 'theirs', 'funny', 'stories', 'laced', 'considerable', 'hostility', 'other', 'participants', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'dark', 'three', 'Appointment', 'Death', 'darkest', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'harken', 'back', 'Lindberg', 'kidnapping', 'close', 'second', 'happily', 'ever', 'sort', 'story', 'Third', 'Girl', 'somewhat', 'lighter', 'not', 'much', 'character', 'Ariadne', 'Oliver', 'played', 'Zo', 'Wanamaker', 'flight', 'instructor', 'Quidich', 'coach', 'ofHarry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'delightful', 'not', 'quite', 'pictured', 'Christie', 'stories', 'like', 'Ms', 'Wanamaker', 'version', 'much', 'better']",N/A

Too many of the stories involving Poirot tend to make the character overly comical (more caricature than character).  In this movie, he is painfully human.  Third Girl was fun primarily because of Zoe Wanamaker as novelist Ariadne Oliver.  She's the perfect foil for Poirot.  Appointment with Death was unique because it's the first time I've seen Tim Curry (as Lord Boynton) tone it down and actually play a role without overdoing it to death.This is a set I will enjoy for many years.

L'hoir,"[1, 1]","To me, the Poirot series simply gets better and better as far as production values are concerned.I have read and have enjoyed each of these books. If this splendid BBC production does not capture Agatha Christie's every word (and her complex prose, word-for-word, would likely not survive its transition to television), it captures their essence. Moreover, each title represents a different facet of Christie's art of detective fiction.""Murder on the Orient Express"" exemplifies the ""locked room"" puzzle, which, since we all know ""who dunnit"" by this time, is no longer a puzzle. However, Britain's A-list cast, which, besides David Suchet, includes David Morrissey, Eileen Atkins, Samuel West, and Barbara Hershey, more than compensates for any lack of suspense. The production also recreates the magnificent elegance of what it used to be like for the privileged few to travel on that train, whose very name conjures up an aura of mystery and adventure. The story also gives us a Poirot who wrestles with the consequences of his solving the mystery, both emotionally and spiritually. He becomes so much more than a cardboard character urging others to ""use the little grey cells"" and contemplating a life of retirement to cultivate vegetable marrows (aka Zucchini).""The Third Girl,"" which features Agatha Christie's eccentric alter ego, Ariadne Oliver--delightfully rendered by Zoe Wanamaker--who is said to have penned mystery novels about a Finnish Detective, invites us to accompany Oliver and Poirot to an aristocratic weekend party at a stately country home, where Peter Bowles is, once again, to the manor born. In addition to the skeet shooting, more murders occur, more false clues are planted and unmasked, and at the end, all the guests are assembled in the drawing room, where Poirot astounds them--and us--with the solution to the mystery.""Appointment with Death"" which features a stunning Elizabeth McGovern--falls into the category of Christie's archaeological mysteries--fascinating because she accompanied her husband-archaeologist on his excavations and knew her subject. The mystery evokes the exotic ambience of Syria, in what turned out to be the last decade of the British Empire. The departure from the original story, which begins in Jerusalem and ends in the rose-red city of Petra (Jordan), probably stems both from political and monetary considerations. The production is still lovely to behold.I was interested in reading criticisms below that complain about the absence of Miss Lemon and Hastings. Well, if one actually reads ""Express"", ""Girl,"" and ""Appointment,"" one will discover that Christie included neither of these characters in any of them. Furthermore, Miss Lemon appeared as a character only in several stories, and, if we can believe the words of Ariadne Oliver, who called her Finnish detective's assistant his ""idiot friend,"" Christie became bored with Hastings, who was little more than a Dr. Watson surrogate. Another criticism lamented the darkness of these mysteries. If one reads Christie carefully, though, her mysteries are indeed dark. Furthermore, she kept evolving as a writer, so there is no reason that the BBC renditions should remain stuck in the Hastings/Lemon mode. We still get the ""little grey cells""!This series exemplifies the best of the BBC: top-drawer actors; splendid costumes and elegant settings.

Combined they make any British Mystery viewer salivate. Add top guest stars in each, SUBTITLES for the hearing and dialect challenged, and kick in some of the best filmed period mystery ever produced. It's what fans have come to expect with Poirot, Agatha Christie, Masterpiece Mystery, and the untouchable as Hercule Poirot--David Suchet. The best Poirot yet, of what I've seen.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS--Perhaps the best of A. Christie's books. It was written in 1934 and the story begins Sep. 26, 1938.Poirot is allowed to fill an unoccupied birth as the Orient Express moves out from Istanbul to England. The luxury car he rides includes American Samuel Ratchett (Toby Jones), a princess (Eileen Atkins of `Cold Mountain'), railroad director Bouc, a doctor,&...well a dozen travelers. The Orient Express gets stuck in a snowdrift (a true event that inspired A. Christie) and the group is also visited with a murder in the train car. There is proof the murderer is yet on the train and Poirot (with the help of the railroader and doctor) intends to find him/her. That's the plot, simple enough, but the deed, and the unveiling of the killer is what makes this story so exceptional, memorable, and emotional. You'll want to watch it a second and third time....47 minutes of Suchet hosting a tour of the present Orient Express is an interesting documentary added. He took the ride prior to playing the part for this movie. Also bonus on this disc includes `120 years with Agatha Christie', a list of Poirot books, & filmographies. 89 minute feature.THIRD GIRL--The 1966 published book begins with Norma Restarick (Jemima Rooper) asking Poirot for help as she MAY have murdered. Poirot's crime writer friend, Ariadne (Zoe Wanamaker) gets in on the case after Norma's ex-nanny's suicide proves to be murder. Peter Bowles plays a blind uncle, James Wilby plays Norma's father, and these and other fine stars make the excellent suspense and mystery come to life--or should we also say `to death?'  Top mystery and crime drama....bonus is only filmographies, but the feature is 93 minutes.APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH--The book was published in 1938, but the story is Syria, 1937. An archaeological dig after the head of John the Baptist is visited by Lord Boynton (Tim Curry) the dig head, domineering Lady Boynton (Cheryl Campbell), son Leonard Boynton, adopted adult children Raymond, Carol, Jinny, writer Westholme (Elizabeth McGovern), Dr Sarah King, a nun, an aged nanny, others, and of course Poirot. Lady Boynton is about as popular as the sand fleas and ends up dead, giving Poirot a case, and plenty of suspects. Also plenty of bodies begin to pile up looking something like an episode in ""Midsomer Murders."" A fascinating finish, as expected from Agatha Christie....some film written notes by Curry, and cast filographies make up the bonus. 93 min. feature.There is perfection in these Agatha Christie Poirot stories.There is finesse in the acting from Suchet and many, many others.There is quality in the production of these DVDs by Acorn Media.There are subtitles provided by Acorn Media.And personally, my wife and I enjoyed the documentary and history of riding on the Orient Express train as much as we did the movies.

754229,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,B00009MEAL,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[2, 2]","This set of Agatha Christie adaptations starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot has gotten mixed reviews. The reasons are for the most part due to the departures from the text (though most reviews tolerate the changes to Third Girl) and the tone of two movies (again, Third Girl being the exception).Someone who's read the originals will have a different take than those who didn't. I will make some comments on the first two that I have read as far as a comparison, but for the most part I'll try to aim for those who have not read the books.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. This was my first exposure to Agatha Christie, viewing the movie with Albert Finney. As far as Suchet's, it's the darkest adaptation I've seen, and while I think our society is focusing too much on the edgy and dark, I don't think it was bad here. This story shows a Poirot who is wrestling with his convictions and views of justice. No, it's not the most enjoyable adaptation, but I think the writing was creative.Some reviewers don't like that this one and ""Appointment With Death"" deal with Poirot's Catholicism (something I never noticed in Christie's books, but something that wouldn't be surprising for a Belgian in the '30's). No, it is not a pro-Christian agenda; if anything, it questions religious absolutism. In fact, one scene was a parallel of Jesus' parable of the Pharisee and the Publican, having on a split screen the pompous prayer of Poirot and the penitent petition of the perpetrator. (I know, I overdid the alliteration. Sorry.)One last comment. It mentions several stars in this movie, but one not mentioned was Jessica Chastain, who was the bright spot in this story.THIRD GIRL. While Orient Express was my first impression of Agatha Christie, Third Girl is the most recent. The writers took liberties with the story, with differences showing up in the revelation of the killer; I think some were improvements and others, to be kind, weren't. Peter Bowles from ""To The Manor Born"" stole the show.APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH. I watched the movie adaptation with Peter Ustinov, but forgot the title. This one took so much liberties that I saw similarities but was not sure it was the same story. One reviewer made a list of how this differed from the original story. Actually, I probably enjoyed it more not knowing it was the same story as the movie I saw. It had some disturbing images, but I don't think it's as terrible as other reviewers. It did feature one of my favorite actors, Tim Curry, and he had some bright spots but didn't give life to the movie as well as Bowles did to Third Girl.Allow me to mention something about one of the differences pointed out, which is how late in the story Poirot gets involved. I don't see that as a problem. After all, this is a movie. Would you want the star to not be involved for half the movie? That difference is very excusable. I will comment that I actually liked the film's ending better than the Ustinov movie.A brief summary: I probably won't rewatch Orient Express, but the reasons are because of its quality, not due to a lack of it. I'd gladly give Third Girl another view. Appointment With Death is one I'd not go out of the way to watch, nor would I go out of the way to avoid watching it either.",5,Three Interesting (Though Not The Most Faithful) Adaptations of Three Poirot Novels,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,3245,"['set', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'adaptations', 'starring', 'David', 'Suchet', 'Hercule', 'Poirot', 'gotten', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'reasons', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'due', 'departures', 'text', 'most', 'reviews', 'tolerate', 'changes', 'Third', 'Girl', 'tone', 'two', 'movies', 'again', 'Third', 'Girl', 'being', 'exception', '.Someone', 'who', 'read', 'originals', 'will', 'have', 'different', 'take', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'will', 'make', 'comments', 'first', 'two', 'have', 'read', 'as', 'far', 'comparison', 'most', 'part', ""'ll"", 'try', 'aim', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books.MURDER', 'ON', 'THE', 'ORIENT', 'EXPRESS', 'was', 'first', 'exposure', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'viewing', 'movie', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'As', 'far', 'Suchet', 'darkest', 'adaptation', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'think', 'society', 'focusing', 'too', 'much', 'edgy', 'dark', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'bad', 'here', 'story', 'Poirot', 'who', 'wrestling', 'convictions', 'views', 'justice', 'No', 'not', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'adaptation', 'think', 'writing', 'was', 'creative.Some', 'reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'Appointment', 'Death', 'deal', 'Poirot', 'Catholicism', 'something', 'never', 'noticed', 'Christie', 'books', 'something', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprising', 'Belgian', ""'30"", 'No', 'not', 'pro-Christian', 'agenda', 'anything', 'questions', 'religious', 'absolutism', 'fact', 'one', 'scene', 'was', 'parallel', 'Jesus', 'parable', 'Pharisee', 'Publican', 'having', 'split', 'screen', 'pompous', 'prayer', 'Poirot', 'penitent', 'petition', 'perpetrator', 'know', 'overdid', 'alliteration', 'Sorry', 'One', 'last', 'comment', 'several', 'stars', 'movie', 'one', 'not', 'mentioned', 'was', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'who', 'was', 'bright', 'spot', 'story.THIRD', 'GIRL', 'Orient', 'Express', 'was', 'first', 'impression', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Third', 'Girl', 'most', 'recent', 'writers', 'took', 'liberties', 'story', 'differences', 'showing', 'up', 'revelation', 'killer', 'think', 'were', 'improvements', 'others', 'be', 'kind', 'were', ""n't"", 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'Manor', 'Born', 'stole', 'show.APPOINTMENT', 'WITH', 'DEATH', 'watched', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'forgot', 'title', 'one', 'took', 'so', 'much', 'liberties', 'saw', 'similarities', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'same', 'story', 'One', 'reviewer', 'made', 'list', 'how', 'differed', 'original', 'story', 'Actually', 'probably', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'not', 'knowing', 'was', 'same', 'story', 'movie', 'saw', 'had', 'disturbing', 'images', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'terrible', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', 'feature', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'had', 'bright', 'spots', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'life', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Bowles', 'did', 'Third', 'Girl.Allow', 'mention', 'something', 'one', 'differences', 'pointed', 'out', 'how', 'late', 'story', 'Poirot', 'involved', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'problem', 'movie', 'Would', 'want', 'star', 'not', 'be', 'involved', 'movie', 'difference', 'very', 'excusable', 'will', 'comment', 'actually', 'liked', 'film', 'ending', 'better', 'Ustinov', 'movie.A', 'brief', 'summary', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rewatch', 'Orient', 'Express', 'reasons', 'are', 'quality', 'not', 'due', 'lack', ""'d"", 'gladly', 'give', 'Third', 'Girl', 'view', 'Appointment', 'Death', 'one', ""'d"", 'not', 'go', 'way', 'watch', 'would', 'go', 'way', 'avoid', 'watching']",N/A

Beins ""Diversity Encouraged""","[3, 3]","I must admit, I put off watching Murder on the Orient Express for some time due to the mixed reviews it had received, particularly when compared to the old film starring Albert Finney.I shouldn't have.The story is so well known that instead of trying to maintain suspense they chose to deepen the moral complexity of the situation and Poirot's reaction to it.  I was very pleased with this approach.The original film was designed for maximum, guiltless entertainment and star turns and succeeded admirably on that basis (although I admit that I never cared for Finney's interpretation).This new version deals more compellingly with what is really at stake to 'take the law into your own hands', even when we feel entitled and justified to do so, and where such thinking can lead.  And Poirot, who has always maintained the rule of fact and truth is deeply troubled by the choice he makes at the end.  One of Poirot's most comforting characteristics is his impartiality.  He is true justice, meted out equally on the basis of truth and neither personality or position or appeals to sentiment can sway him.  The choice he makes is chaos entering his well-ordered world of fact, moral certainty and justice.  His decision may be humane but it is not a course of action to be trusted in ordering a civilized world. And his final, impassioned speech when confronted by the results of his 'little gray cells' is brilliant.  One can only hope that those who have asked him to compromise his principles of a lifetime will learn the truth of his words and face a judgement of their own making.The other two stories are well done, the mysteries hold together well, and, although liberties are taken with the original texts, they work very well on their own terms.I would also say that, yes, I DO like the darker tone of these A&E; treatments.  They are more mature, open more lines of thought, and in general update and breath new life into Poirot.  And since this is a free world, I can like the more frivolous but charming Ustinov Poirot, the dead on, perfect Suchet Poirot and the darker, richer A&E; Poirot.

I had recently both reread the book and seen the all-star extravaganza with Albert Finney (probably the only really good all-star one of its generation). I felt like about the Davis Suchet version (much as I adore him in the role) that the writers took off in the same way Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings --- basically the writers wrote their own story. Given, Ingrid Bergman's role in the older movie was created for her, so basically netted her an Oscar for a character that does not appear in the book ""teaching little brown babies more backwards than myself."" The character is there; it is not fleshed out to this extent. In this version, the characters are all there but the solution is slightly changed (the 12th murderer is WHO?) and I have to agree with some of the negative reviews. The characters are flat, really the script is weak compared to both the book and the older movie. The decision to show the result of the case he was wrapping up in Palestine (the denouement is very dark) and its effect on him did not work for me. (He is wrapping up a case in both the book and the older movie, but the outcome is not described in either, and you get the impression he was happy with the results. Poirot as dapper, a little eccentric without realizing he is eccentric, flamboyant at Finney played him.

754239,AOCVPRFNS2IKN,B00009MEAL,Lover of English,"[9, 12]","I agree with everything said in the review ""Abomination"".  I was terribly disappointed in ""Murder on the Orient Express"".  I have been waiting years for David Suchet to make the movie since I hated the Albert Finney version which was completely over the top.  I don't like movies that have many, many stars.  Since they all have a short time on screen they go overboard in trying to make their small contribution significant.David Suchet has owned the role of Poirot for many years now although I was a reluctant convert to his genius.  He was quite different from my picture of Poirot as portrayed in the books, all of which I had read many, many times.  But I was won over by his charm, his never-failing courtesy to every person he encountered, his smile and his twinkling eyes.  Alas, all were missing from ""Murder on the Orient Express"".  It was dark, he was dour, manic (what was that business with the rosary?) and nearly apoplectic at the end.  I suspect that some PC snuck in here.  Agatha Christie didn't have any problem suggesting that justice had indeed been done at the end and Poirot didn't agonize over it.  The 1930s were not the 2000s.  Leave the past aloneOne of the joys of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is the silent character - the train.  I love train travel and am planning a trip on the new Orient Express.  This train is platinum class just as the original Orient Express was.  Another way that the producers managed to ruin this movie was to let the train get frozen on the inside.  This would never have happened.  They would have kept the train heated.  This was just another little bit of nastiness.The author of ""Abomination"" asked how David Suchet could have lent his talents to these contortions of the original books.  But he is not without blame.  I read an interview with him a couple of years ago and he stated that he was exploring the darker side of human nature (something like that).  ""Murder on the Orient Express"" and ""Appointment with Death"" are not the first of his performances wherein he has abandonded his smile in favor of dark introspection.I enjoyed ""The Third Girl"" but ""Appointment with Death"" was really painful to watch.  There was some sadism going on in this production.  The scenes of little children being whipped was played over and over.  There is someting sick about the minds of people who like to produce art (movies, books, paintings, sculpture) that depicts torture.  This is what I cannot understand Suchet lending his name to.Update: I was so disgusted with the presentation of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" that I put the video away intending to donate it to my local public library, but in reading a couple of other reviews I noticed a commentary on the train itself as part of the special features and I have just watched it.  It was marvelous.  I have the video put out by the V/S Orient Express itself but this special feature is so much better that I will now keep the DVD just for this feature.  It is even more inexplicable now that the movie should have turned out so badly - so dark, so dreary, so overlaid with unusual fanatic overtones, so devoid of humor, so lacking in charm, so deficient in details about the train itself - because Suchet took the trip from London to Prague before he made the movie and was full of excitement about the train and the trip because, as he said, ""I'm going to play Poirot in the Orient Express movie"".  This really has me baffled.  It's as though there were a dark angel hovering over the recent productions who sapped all the joy out of the characters, all the humor out of the plots and all the charm out of the earlier productions.",2,Abomination redux,1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,3650,"['agree', 'everything', 'said', 'review', 'Abomination', 'was', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'years', 'David', 'Suchet', 'make', 'movie', 'hated', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'version', 'was', 'completely', 'top', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'have', 'many', 'many', 'stars', 'have', 'short', 'time', 'screen', 'go', 'overboard', 'trying', 'make', 'small', 'contribution', 'significant.David', 'Suchet', 'owned', 'role', 'Poirot', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'was', 'reluctant', 'convert', 'genius', 'was', 'quite', 'different', 'picture', 'Poirot', 'portrayed', 'books', 'had', 'read', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'won', 'over', 'charm', 'never-failing', 'courtesy', 'person', 'encountered', 'smile', 'twinkling', 'eyes', 'Alas', 'were', 'missing', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'was', 'dark', 'was', 'dour', 'manic', 'what', 'was', 'business', 'rosary', 'nearly', 'apoplectic', 'end', 'suspect', 'PC', 'snuck', 'here', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'suggesting', 'justice', 'had', 'indeed', 'been', 'done', 'end', 'Poirot', 'did', ""n't"", 'agonize', '1930s', 'were', 'not', '2000s', 'Leave', 'past', 'aloneOne', 'joys', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'silent', 'character', 'train', 'love', 'train', 'travel', 'am', 'planning', 'trip', 'new', 'Orient', 'Express', 'train', 'platinum', 'class', 'just', 'original', 'Orient', 'Express', 'was', 'way', 'producers', 'managed', 'ruin', 'movie', 'was', 'let', 'train', 'get', 'frozen', 'inside', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'train', 'heated', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'nastiness.The', 'author', 'Abomination', 'asked', 'how', 'David', 'Suchet', 'could', 'have', 'lent', 'talents', 'contortions', 'original', 'books', 'not', 'blame', 'read', 'interview', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'stated', 'was', 'exploring', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'something', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'Appointment', 'Death', 'are', 'not', 'first', 'performances', 'wherein', 'abandonded', 'smile', 'favor', 'dark', 'introspection.I', 'enjoyed', 'Third', 'Girl', 'Appointment', 'Death', 'was', 'really', 'painful', 'watch', 'was', 'sadism', 'going', 'production', 'scenes', 'little', 'children', 'being', 'whipped', 'was', 'played', 'over', 'someting', 'sick', 'minds', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'produce', 'art', 'movies', 'books', 'paintings', 'sculpture', 'torture', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'Suchet', 'lending', 'name', 'to.Update', 'was', 'so', 'disgusted', 'presentation', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'put', 'video', 'away', 'intending', 'donate', 'local', 'public', 'library', 'reading', 'couple', 'other', 'reviews', 'noticed', 'commentary', 'train', 'part', 'special', 'features', 'have', 'just', 'watched', 'was', 'marvelous', 'have', 'video', 'put', 'out', 'V/S', 'Orient', 'Express', 'special', 'feature', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'will', 'now', 'keep', 'DVD', 'just', 'feature', 'even', 'more', 'inexplicable', 'now', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'so', 'badly', 'so', 'dark', 'so', 'dreary', 'so', 'overlaid', 'unusual', 'fanatic', 'overtones', 'devoid', 'humor', 'so', 'lacking', 'charm', 'so', 'deficient', 'details', 'train', 'Suchet', 'took', 'trip', 'London', 'Prague', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'full', 'excitement', 'train', 'trip', 'because', 'said', ""'m"", 'going', 'play', 'Poirot', 'Orient', 'Express', 'movie', 'really', 'baffled', 'were', 'dark', 'angel', 'hovering', 'recent', 'productions', 'who', 'sapped', 'joy', 'characters', 'humor', 'plots', 'charm', 'earlier', 'productions']",N/A

The episodes feature David Suchet as the dapper Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot, Hugh Fraser as his bumbling but loyal friend Capt. Arthur Hastings, Philip Jackson as Chief Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard, and Pauline Moran as Poirot's fastidious secretary Miss Lemon, though she only appears in ""The Double Clue"" on this disc. The cast and deco/modernist production design are in fine form in these three episodes, but I award Set 5 only 4 stars, because the plots of the first two episodes are not up to the highest standard of these early seasons of the Poirot series. The episodes are:Poirot and Capt. Hastings have traveled to a small town, very much out of their way, on false pretences in ""The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor"". Poirot was summoned by an inn-keeper who would like the detective to solve a baffling mystery...in a novel he is writing. Unimpressed, Poirot hastens to leave town but is intercepted when the owner of Marsdon Manor, Mr. Jack Maltravers (Ian McCulloch), is found dead on his estate, apparently of a hemorrhage due to stomach problems. His young wife Susan Maltravers (Geraldine Alexander) is convinced that her husband was frightened to death by the ghost of a young woman believed to haunt the Manor. Inspector Japp is on the case, and Poirot exploits the culprit's superstitions to solve the crime.Poirot is not very active in ""The Double Clue"", which he spends infatuated with a lady, the elegant Russian Countess Vera Rossakoff (Vera Markham). Chief Inspector Japp implores Poirot to save his job, which is in jeopardy due to a series of unsolved jewel robberies. The forth robbery occurs at a party thrown by jewel collector Marcus Hardman (David Lyon). A necklace that once belonged to Catherine de' Medici disappears from this safe while the guests attend a concert in the garden. Three of the guests returned to the house during the concert, however, including the Countess. Enchanted with the Russian exile, Poirot seems to abandon his friends and Japp to spend time with her. So Capt. Hastings and Miss Lemon try to solve the mystery themselves.""The Mystery of the Spanish Chest"" features one of the more gruesome murders of Poirot's career. An old acquaintance, Lady Caroline Chatterton (Antonia Pemberton), asks Poirot to investigate Mr. Edward Clayton (Malcolm Sinclair), the husband of her friend Marguerite (Caroline Langrishe). She fears that Edward, whose mood has turned violent recently, may murder his wife. But it is Edward Clayton who is murdered...right under Poirot's nose. His body is found inside a large Spanish chest in the home of Major John Rich (Pip Torrens), a competitor for Marguerite's affections. He was apparently killed during a party which Poirot attended with the intention of observing Edward. Inspector Japp arrests Major Rich, the obvious suspect, but Poirot is skeptical.The DVD (Acorn 2003): Bonus features are a text interview with David Suchet, a text bio of Agatha Christie, and a list of Poirot books. Those are the same features that are on every Collector's Set disc. There are also filmographies of 9 actors and an essay entitled ""Poirot's Art Deco World"" which briefly discusses the Art Deco movement and design themes as relates to Poirot episodes.

Perhaps the 1974 film has a better ensemble cast than the David Suchet's cast.  The real gem of this disk was the tour on the Orient Express by David Suchet.Next, the ""Third Girl"" was marvelous and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and wished that the movie was longer.  David Suchet was excellent.Enjoyed ""Appointment with Death"", but I kept thinking of Agatha Christie's other Poirot movie set in old Iraq at a archeology dig.

754248,A42GFMF12V7XR,B00009MEAL,Paul J. Mular,"[85, 94]","First I want to make it clear that I have compared the Acorn Media DVDs to the PBS broadcast.  The Acorn Media DVDs clock in from 89 to 94 minutes long while the PBS broadcast ended around the 85 minute mark, and this includes their Masterpiece Mystery open & host introduction. There is a Masterpiece Mystery logo at the beginning, but I think Acorn Media had to tag that on to connect it to PBS.  This is the UK Version.  I did not do a scene by scene comparison to see what PBS cut.Regardless of the sequence listed on the box, I feel the first viewing should be  THE THIRD GIRL (2009 - 94 minutes). Even though in the book canon it is much later that Orient Express, here it feels earlier. Poirot is at home in his apartment & full of the zest to excite his ""Little Gray Cells"" to solve a mystery.  One almost expects to see Captain Hastings & Inspector Japp turn up even though they are well gone from the series.  Of the three mysteries in this set, this one most feels like the earlier hour-long episodes.  Production values, while good, are not as high as on the latter two destination mysteries.  The action is mostly indoors, restricted to a dozen or so sets, just as in the short story adaptations.  I found this to be the most fun to watch in this set, maybe because it felt familiar.  A psychological mystery of a girl who thinks she may have committed a murder & the strange people around her will keep you wondering just what is up.  Clocking in 4 minutes over an hour and a half guarantees that the PBS version will be missing scenes that are on this DVD.Next I recommend watching APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH (2009 - 93 minutes). Some liberties were taken here while adapting Agatha Christie's 1938 novel, but I feel it makes for a great cinematic mystery. Serious Christie fans have a right to complain about taking liberties with her work since atrocities have been done in the past. I have read the book and seen this DVD and this time I feel it is for the better.  I am not saying they are improving on the original book, I am just saying the book would not have directly translated well to a mystery movie.  Poirot appears in this movie right from the start and the mystery of who these characters are and what brings them there is withheld for a while in the movie, helping to build the atmosphere & character.  The book gives Poirot an obligatory appearance at the start & then he disappears while the mysterious characters of the story are introduced right away.  A transcript interview with David Suchet reveals that they veered away some what from the original story in adapting the book.  While he wishes to stay true to the mysteries he seems to feel the same way as me.  Guest-star Tim Burton also has a transcripted interview talking about how he wanted to do a Poirot mystery with David Suchet & how he got on it.  Again, this runs over the Hour and a Half mark.In MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (2010 - 89 minutes) David Suchet now portrays a more troubled & aged Poirot, one who no longer seems to get the pleasure of using his ""little gray cells"".  He battles between the concept of Truth & Justice while upholding the written law when the law seems unjust.  Poirot also looks ill, much like the last episodes of Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes.  Yet when you watch the bonus documentary with David Suchet traveling on the present day Orient Express you see that the actor is energetic & well.  It is also fun to hear David talk in his true voice in this documentary.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS was produced in Hi Definition & Acorn will be releasing a Blu-ray version later this year.Agatha Christie Poirot: Murder On the Orient Express (2010) (Blu-ray)I did a comparison of this standard DVD, using a Blu-ray player to unconvert it to 1080p, to PBS's Hi-Def 1080i broadcast on a HD-TV.  I saw little difference over all, the many lush exterior shots of the train and the landscape seem to take advantage of the Hi-Def picture more that the interior shots.  In both cases grain was at a minimum, but the trees & landscape took on more depth in the HD broadcast.  Keep in mind that the Blu-ray presentation will be in 1080p as opposed to PBS's 1080i broadcast, and I was watching a ""Clear QAM"" transmission of the PBS signal over a Cable TV system.  These factors mean that the Hi-Def picture I watched over PBS would not be as sharp as a Blu-ray disc.  However this presentation looks fine over a HD-TV monitor smaller than 36"".  Since the Blu-ray release is planned to be a stand-alone disc, you may want to consider your screen size before dishing out the extra bucks.The other two mysteries are hold-overs from last year and were not produced in Hi-definition.  While they look good, they are not quite as sharp.All are Anamorphic Widescreen presentations with optional subtitles to help with the accents.",5,Acorn Media delivers the original uncut U.K.

754250,A2GKUYCO6SGUIB,B00009MEAL,Peter N. Breitman,"[80, 99]","The reviews of this Poirot release are pretty much evenly split between pro and con. Therefore, I shall go both ways.PROI have read all of the Poirot books and short stories, but that was many years ago (I am well past being a sexagenarian). Even if some slight changes from the book were made to ""Third Girl,"" the episode was perfect Suchet Poirot, just like the TV series and most, but not all, of the movies. It was well thought out and well presented. The story was told in logical sequence; Poirot gathered the facts and reached his conclusion in the end.CON""Murder on the Orient Express"" was more than murder; it was a disaster. All of the actors were totally wooden, amateurish and just did not present their parts effectively. Many feel that movies laden with ""stars"" suffer from the process; however, not the Albert Finney version. Each character was beautifully described and acted (Ingrid Bergman received an Academy Award). Take especial note of Mrs. Hubbard. In both the book and the Finney version, she just didn't shut up. In the Suchet version, we barely knew she was there. She was the mastermind who set up the entire plot and tried to create red herrings. In the finale of both the book and the Finney movie, Poirot, with a little soul searching, felt that justice would be best served by allowing the perpetrators to go unpunished, and presented the ""phony"" solution to the Yugoslavian police. In the Suchet version, Poirot almost goes crazy, yelling that this is not the way to go, but he is forced to do so. He almost has an apoplectic fit. NO, this version does not deserve viewing.""Appointment with Death"" was even worse. As a result of some of the negative reviews, and after seeing the movie, I reread the book (my paperback contains 192 pages). There were so many changes to the book as to almost make it a completely different story. Sometimes changes benefit a story. In this case, they were all to its detriment.The following are the significant differences between the book and the movie. I'm sure I have forgotten to mention one or two.1. The movie begins with a significant excavation being conducted in Egypt by Mrs. Boynton's archeologist husband. He was looking for the skull of John the Baptist. In the book, Mrs. Boynton was a widow, there were no excavations, and everyone was merely sightseeing.2. The first 56 pages of the book involved a thorough fleshing out, or description, of the Boynton family members and the other important characters. Poirot did not appear until page 56 when he simply emerged from an elevator. He did not reappear until page 81, AFTER Mrs. Boynton's death. When the crime was committed, he was in a completely different location. In the movie, he was present with all the other characters. It was not until page 99 that he arrived upon the scene.3. A nun enters near the beginning of the movie (later to be determined to be involved in white slavery). There was no nun in the book, nor any reference to white slavery.4. Lady Westholme was in both the movie and the book, but there was absolutely no similarity between them, and that completely changed the complexion of the story. Miss Pierce, who was always at Lady Westholme's side in the book, and also played a significant part in the mystery, was absent from the movie. Lennox Boynton's wife, Nadine, was also absent from the movie. She, too, played a significant part.5. In the movie, Lennox Boynton had a very outgoing and pushy personality. In the book he was way past docile. He had been mentally beaten into that state by his mother.6. The movie contained the nanny of the children when they were young. There was no nanny in the book. The subsequent death of the nanny could not have occurred in the book since she did not exist there.7. Throughout the movie there were flashbacks of the children crying in the bedroom, and visions, looking through a partially-open bathroom door, of the nanny physically abusing the children, amid their screams, and with Mrs. Boynton watching. The book contained no nanny, no flashbacks and no physical abuse. It was stated more than once that Mrs. Boynton was a ""mental sadist."" There was no physical abuse.8. In the movie, the daughter, Ginny, was just another child of Mrs. Boynton. She was even the aggressor and stole a kiss from another character, and fell asleep in his arms. In the book she was the youngest child, the one most affected by her mother's mental sadism from which she sought shelter in a dream world.9. I won't go into detail, but Jefferson Cope was a completely different person from book to movie.10. WHO committed the murder and HOW was it committed? The movie and book are significantly different in both respects.11. Finally, the denouement, the revelation of the crime and the guilty was so completely different from the book as to make them two stories that had no relation to one another.David Suchet has appeared in so many Poirot mysteries, and has performed so well in them. WHY did he ever consent to be present in this abomination? This is a definite mark against his reputation as the ultimate Poirot.If ""Third Girl"" is ever issued singly, I shall purchase it and donate this set to the public library. At least I will get a tax deduction out of it.ADDENDUM at April 25, 2011I have solved my problem.

754253,A9CRL5P1MG0HD,B00009MEAL,revit,"[0, 0]","By RevitMurder on the Orient Express is one of Dame Agatha Christie's greatest mysteries. Most of us who are fans of this author have become familiar with the preferences, intentions, and feelings she conveys in her stories. We know that she wants to entertain her readers and wants everybody to be happy. She decries lying, cheating and most of all murder. She values justice but views it as being a little different than a literal interpretation of the law. It is expected that scene writers, directors and actors making films based on her stories are respectful and follow her preferences. When the excellent film Murder on the Orient Express staring Albert Finney as Poirot with an all star cast was released in 1974 we were all delighted with it. The book the movie was based on ends when Poirot who had just related two solutions for the murder of Ratchett to the assembled travelers in the Calais Coach has asked the Director of the Orient Express Line to select one of the solutions and present it to the Jugo-Slavian police when they arrive. At that point Poirot says ""having placed my solutions before you I have the honour to retire from the case..."" Thus Agatha Christie had succeeded in getting her favorite detective out of the case without presenting any un-factual information to the police. As we know Hollywood prefers an ending that complies with the law so in the film the selected solution is placed before the police.When a remake of the movie was made in 2013 with David Suchet in the staring role, some of us were surprised with the outcome. It was a major rewrite that has a slightly different approach than Agatha Christie's masterpiece. One might even conjecture that Agatha Christie would not have liked the remake at all; but she may have loved it. It includes a few newly written segments that were not part of the original book and in my view would probably never have been written by Agatha Christie. At the beginning of the film there was a several minute scene in Syria where Poirot repeatedly and aggressively accused a distinguished young officer of lying to him to the point of causing the young man to draw his pistol and shoot himself in front of his superior officer, his friends and Poirot. The officer who was assigned to see Poirot off to the boat that would take him to Istanbul timidly slipped a comment in at the end of his carefully prepared speech to the effect that he didn't think the young officer who shot himself should have had to pay such a heavy price for one small mistake.There was a fairly long series of scenes in the back streets of Istanbul where Poirot saw a young couple witness a crowd descend on a girl, who had been accused of adultery, spit on her and stone her to death. When Poirot boarded the Orient Express he saw the young woman who had witnessed the stoning. When she began to express compassion for the girl who had been killed, Poirot responded saying that the girl had to suffer a violent death because it was the penalty for what she had done under the law she knew and lived by.For many years we have been spoiled with Suchet's brilliant interpretations of Hercule Poirot. We loved all of the early episodes when he lived in a marvelous Art Deco apartment house and had Miss Lemon, Captain Hastings and Chief Inspector Japp to keep the cases running smoothly. When his Art Deco apartment was replaced by a smaller apartment with warm brown mahogany paneling, and Captain Hastings and Miss Lemon had faded away to be replaced by a gentleman's gentleman, Poirot grew a little less tolerant of the cheats, liars and murderers. Still he remained a gentleman and focused on apprehending wrong doers. In this most recent 2013 version of Murder on the Orient Express, he has changed a lot. He has become a little cranky and a more demanding old man who insists on the law being obeyed. His focus has shifted to include more religion and he holds the blind goddess of justice and law high above everything else. The end of the movie took place in the Calais Coach of the train with all of the passengers locked in the dining car. The electricity was out, and at night it was dark and cold. The atmosphere was foreboding. Poirot insisted that those who had stabbed Ratchett were guilty of murder; he spent a sleepless night. When the tracks were cleared of snow, the police arrived and the sun came up shining Poirot re-evaluated the situation. With his conscience tearing at his heart he presented the conductors uniform to the police telling them of an unidentified man, probably Mafia related, who had boarded the train at a station, murdered Ratchett, and left the train in the night at another station. Poirot retreated in silent tears.I did not enjoy it the first time I saw it; I do not agree with the way the original story has been changed, If you read Curtain: Poirot's Last case you will understand that Poirot does not develop in the way depicted in this movie. But there is a lot to be said for holding justice and the law up high.",2,What happened to the Poirot we knew so well?,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,5014,"['RevitMurder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'one',

The best thing about these 3 movies is the short documentary of David Suchet riding on the Orient Express. This is the only portion of this set that is filmed and edited well. The 3 movies in this set stray so severely from the original stories, you just can't watch them with those stories in mind. If you go on to view these, view them with the idea that they are just different stories all together. Even if you are a Tim Curry fan and think that it would be fun to watch Appointment With Death just because of his acting presence, don't bother. It is a made up, weak role, and I can't imagine why Mr. Curry would have been bothered. The overly dramatic and dark Murder on the Orient Express shoves Poirot into a position of religious, and moral soul searching that fans of this detective are unaccustomed to. A better buy is the version filmed with Albert Finney. It is filmed much better and is a better entertainment value. Which brings up the last point that these are simply filmed and edited poorly.

This is the first time I didn't find Poirot amusing and likeable.  He may be always be ,haughty about his fame and ability to solve crimes yet he is always likeable, but not here.  Over many years, I've seen David Suchet as Poirot in just about every single episode and movie he has done.  I like the earliest ones with Hastings and Miss Limon the best, but even the later ones are not as bad as how he is portrayed here in Murder on the Orient Express. I've seen the one with Albert Finey and that movie was much better,  though David Suchet, except in this one, is the ultimate Poirot. Finey was just passable.  I'll watch the Albert Finey one again for all the great old movie stars in it,and the better acting by them.  If it were not for the Third Girl and Appointment With Death, where Poirot seems to be almost his old self, I'd throw this DVD away and never watch any further episodes that come out after these. I know the stories are changed from the books, sometimes they are almost entirely different, but that does not bother me.  Oh, and I did love the train, itself, the Orient Express.  Maybe I'll watch again just for that.  Almost forgot to say the DVDs play very nicely and look very good on my old T.V.",3,"Yes, Give Us Back The Old Poirot",1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,1304,"['agree', 'everyone', 'who', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'pretty', 'awful', 'first', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Poirot', 'amusing', 'likeable', 'may', 'be', 'always', 'be', 'haughty', 'fame', 'ability', 'solve', 'crimes', 'yet', 'always', 'likeable', 'not', 'here', 'many', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'David', 'Suchet', 'Poirot', 'just', 'single', 'episode', 'movie', 'done', 'earliest', 'ones', 'Hastings', 'Miss', 'Limon', 'best', 'even', 'later', 'ones', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'how', 'portrayed', 'here', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'Albert', 'Finey', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'David', 'Suchet', 'one', 'ultimate', 'Poirot', 'Finey', 'was', 'just', 'passable', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'Albert', 'Finey', 'one', 'again', 'great', 'old', 'movie', 'better', 'acting', 'were', 'not', 'Third', 'Girl', 'Appointment', 'Death', 'where', 'Poirot', 'be', 'almost', 'old', 'self', ""'d"", 'throw', 'DVD', 'away', 'never', 'watch', 'further', 'episodes', 'come', 'out', 'know', 'stories', 'are', 'changed', 'books', 'sometimes', 'are', 'almost', 'entirely', 'different', 'not', 'bother', 'Oh', 'did', 'love', 'train', 'Orient', 'Express', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'Almost', 'forgot', 'say', 'DVDs', 'play', 'very', 'nicely', 'look', 'very', 'good', 'old', 'T.V']",N/A

If you're a fan of the Christie novel, you might prefer the 1974 version, as it is a bit more faithful to the novel than this one is. This one focuses a bit more on Poirot and his background.

Several of his later works lack the intensity and flamboyance present in his early work that made his character so popular. At the same time, his once superb mustache has become flat and lifeless.If you like Suchet, you will like this series.  But it lacks the punch of his earlier works.The one exception is Murder on the Orient Express.  What should have been a crowning achievement is a major disappointment. All the clever little quirks and details that brought the famous detective to life are completely missing from his performance. You could have replaced him with a cardboard cutout and spoken his lines from offstage with the same effect. The whole cast seems to follow Suchet's lead, delivering lifeless performances in a stale atmosphere. It's as if the ending was a foregone conclusion. There is no tension over the murder, no background buzz about the gaiety and thrill of the adventure from riding the fabulously exotic, luxurious and perhaps slightly decadent Orient Express. The location is completely wasted. They might as well have filmed this on a public transit bus.I do appreciate that this movie tried to bring a fresh angle to the story and character. The film opens in Turkey, where Poirot witnesses a vicious attack by a crowd upon a woman accused of adultery, and her death by stoning. At the time he appears unmoved and does not interfere, but it obviously affects his later decision about serving justice to the guilty.  I wish they had delved into his feelings about that more deeply, and especially how his character had arrived at his decision. It was a perfect chance to give the audience an intimate look into the character of Poirot, and it was completely missed.Trivia:Did you know Suchet played a role in a Poirot movie starring Peter Ustinov?

Mejia-Gewe,"[3, 4]","As a huge Agatha Christie fan, I have read all of the Hercule Poirot books and have watched all of David Suchet's renditions of Poirot in movies and the TV series of short stories.  I was particularly looking forward to the release of Series 5 because it has Murder on the Orient Express, Christie's most famous and most creative book.  But I was very disappointed by the way that the writers of this set deviated from the books to change the nature of the story and of Poirot himself.I understand that all the movies of her books must contain some deviations from the book to make for good film, but in the earlier renditions of Christie's books, they stayed true to the essence of the book and of Hercule Poirot himself.  There was no reason for them to deviate from the books this time around.Christie's genius was most apparent in Murder on the Orient Express, and the movie could have been very successful if it had stayed true to the nature of Agatha Christie's creation.  But instead of the highly controlled, methodical Poirot, we saw a Poirot who yelled and screamed and made decisions based upon his Catholic faith, which was not characteristic of the true Poirot.  I was especially upset that they actually changed the ending of the book!In the ""Making of"" extra that accompanied Appointment with Death, David Suchet claimed that the original book was impossible to make into a movie, a claim I found difficult to believe.  They twisted the story into something that hardly resembled the original book.I was very disappointed with this set and only give it three stars because the acting itself was excellent, and if you were not familiar with the original books, you might enjoy it.  But if you are a true Agatha Christie fan, you will be very disappointed at the way the Hercule Poirot books have been twisted as much as the Miss Marple books have been of late.",3,"Good acting, but not true to Poirot!",1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,1874,"['huge', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'fan', 'have', 'read', 'Hercule', 'Poirot', 'books', 'have', 'watched', 'David', 'Suchet', 'renditions', 'Poirot', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', 'short', 'stories', 'was', 'particularly', 'looking', 'forward', 'release', 'Series', '5', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'Christie', 'most', 'famous', 'most', 'creative', 'book', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'way', 'writers', 'set', 'deviated', 'books', 'change', 'nature', 'story', 'Poirot', 'himself.I', 'understand', 'movies', 'books', 'must', 'contain', 'deviations', 'book', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'earlier', 'renditions', 'Christie', 'books', 'stayed', 'true', 'essence', 'book', 'Hercule', 'Poirot', 'was', 'reason', 'deviate', 'books', 'time', 'around.Christie', 'genius', 'was', 'most', 'apparent', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'successful', 'had', 'stayed', 'true', 'nature', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'creation', 'instead', 'highly', 'controlled', 'methodical', 'Poirot', 'saw', 'Poirot', 'who', 'yelled', 'screamed', 'made', 'decisions', 'based', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'was', 'not', 'characteristic', 'true', 'Poirot', 'was', 'especially', 'upset', 'actually', 'changed', 'ending', 'book', 'Making', 'extra', 'accompanied', 'Appointment', 'Death', 'David', 'Suchet', 'claimed', 'original', 'book', 'was', 'impossible', 'make', 'movie', 'claim', 'found', 'difficult', 'believe', 'twisted', 'story', 'something', 'hardly', 'resembled', 'original', 'book.I', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'set', 'only', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'were', 'not', 'familiar', 'original', 'books', 'might', 'enjoy', 'are', 'true', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'fan', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'way', 'Hercule', 'Poirot', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'twisted', 'as', 'much', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'late']",N/A
