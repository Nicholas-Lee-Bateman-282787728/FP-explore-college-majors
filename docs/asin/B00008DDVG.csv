I did not view this dvd as I bought it for a gift for my girlfriend who is a huge Gerard Butler fan.  She has viewed it and it played well.  I have seen this before and enjoyed it.  Anyone who is a G.B. fan and is in search for some of his earlier work will like it as he has a large part in it.  His range of emotion is superb, as always, and his acting outstanding. The trial storyline is interesting, but the interaction of the jurors and their life challenges are equally as interesting.  The plot is good and the acting excellent.  The price is wonderful as I paid $145.00 for mine in 2003 when there was nothing out there by G.B.  Dumb me. Lesson learned.

739011,A2QZQBINBG6B5N,B00008DDVG,Charles S. Houser,"[94, 97]","What a powerful piece of drama! Incredible, powerhouse acting and brilliant writing--loaded with subtext. It's impossible to speak too highly of this 6-episode dramatic mini-series.This story focuses on seven of the jurors chosen to serve on an especially grisly murder trial (a Sikh teenager is accused of slaying a classmate with a ceremonial sword). These jurors are a mix of people, some are eager to serve (a woman in an emotionally stifling marriage; a single mom who is estranged from her mother, but who must ask her mother to care for her daughter while she serves on the jury; a lonely older woman with inoperable cancer; a married man whose powerful sense of civic duty is more than matched by a nagging sense of underachievement); some are reluctant (a seminary student who is unsure whether he wants to continue on his path to the priesthood; a recovering alcoholic just out of rehab; a married man who lost all his family's savings due to a bad business venture he was talked). The story, like the trial it revolves around, is a study of mixed motives, changes of heart, and living with fear. In the process of revealing each characters personal daily struggles we discover just how much of the human experience is comprised of learning to endure and deal with violence. In this drama we see the defendant and witnesses badgered by clever lawyers, friends manipulated by friends, and boundary-violating in-laws prying confidential information out of their son-in-law who is serving as a juror. Even the alcoholic's AA sponsor has a touch of the autocrat about him. And the young woman who has fled to jury duty as a way of creating an adventure for herself ends up using her womanly charms to manipulate a man into falling in love with her (even though she is fully aware that she is not free or capable of taking on a romantic relationship with him). I defy anyone to watch this compelling drama without questioning their own propensity to abuse power. We are all capable of being bullies.

I've heard comparisons to Henry Fonda's 12 Angry Men and I would use that comparison to describe this movie to someone who hasn't seen The Jury.  However, 12 Angry Men is a better movie.  The Jury has some post-modern ideas thrown in that I dislike -such as using ""feelings"" to determine innocence and guilt. The movie made it plain that the people who wanted to analyze facts and not emotion where a bunch of ""un-feeling bigots.""  Absurd.  While there may be times that one needs to rely on feelings - that is not how a court case is to be decided (I won't go too much in depth for those who haven't seen this movie). Reason and rationality are to be valued.  People who rely on ""feelings"" are easily manipulated and are not people I'd want to be deciding my fate.  Henry Fonda used reason and that won the day, which is why I prefer 12 Angry Men.  That said, this movie is worth watching because the writing is excellent.

It is an emotional journey into the lives of seven jurors serving on a murder trial. It is also an in depth look at the trial. A 16 year old boy is accused of murdering a schoolmate that bullied him. I don't want to ruin the ending, but the outcome of the trial is pure genius and will really leave you thinking. As for the seven jurors, they all have different backgrounds and come from completely different walks of life. One woman is involved in an unhappy marriage and seeks comfort from another juror. One man is a recovering alcoholic. One man suffers from lack of money due to buying and selling stocks. One man is having trouble with his father-in-law, who wants to be involved in the trial and pesters him with questions about the trial, which he is not allowed to talk about. One man is in the process of becoming a priest, but hesitates because  he still has feelings for an old girlfriend. One woman suffers from a brain tumor and is tomented by memories of a lost son. One woman suffers from the lack of a relationship with her mother, who she is forced to call to watch her daughter while she serves as a juror. Although these seven people are different, thay all play a part in helping one another with their problems and together must determine the fate of a 16 year old boy. Like most people who buy this movie, I bought it because of Gerard Butler, but after seeing it, I could have cared less if he were in it. It is a wonderful series, very emotional and very touching. I highly recomend this to everyone because there is a little something in it for everyone. No matter what types of movies you like, there is some of everything in it.

Price ""kreisleriana""","[2, 2]","I was so impressed (and smitten) by Gerard Butler in The Phantom of the Opera that I picked up The Jury just to see more of him.  I did see more -- I saw an actor of great range in a gentle, achingly realistic portrayal of a recovering alcoholic finding his way sober.  His contribution was beautiful and I loved it.  And happily, there is much more to The Jury.This is an ensemble piece.  The cast includes Derek Jacobi, Helen McCrory, Sylvia Syms, Nicholas Farrell, Sonnell Dadral, and many equally talented actors, each wearing heart on sleeve.  We glimpse into the lives of these jurors, selected at random and pulled from their routines to serve.  Their stories are touching and true-to-life.  In fact, having recently ended an important but failed relationship of my own, I was stunned to find my feelings of grief and loss mirrored in the life of one of the jurors.It is also a compelling crime story depicting the trial of a Sikh teenager accused of the violent slashing murder of a classmate who had tormented him.  The trial unfolds through unembellished evidence and testimony.  While not portrayed minute-to-minute, this aspect of the show is scripted so well that you feel you are in the public gallery.  We struggle too as each juror endeavors to sort through the facts of this horrifying crime to come to a verdict -- the right verdict.  The overwhelming responsibility of their task is revealed in its time.  The script does not lead you to jump to conclusions; the outcome is believeable and not completely comfortable.The musical score is very moving.

The print transfer is terrible.  Grainy, washed out colors, low contrast, and the sound quality rates only one out of five stars.

Butler was much better at showing his talent in Dracula 2000, Attila the Hun, Tombraider: Cradle of Life and The Phantom of the Opera.It is perfectly fitting that defense attorney Sir Derek Jacobi's last film was ""DEAD AGAIN"".

THE JURY is a very interesting ensemble piece - almost a soaper - interweaving the lives of seven of the twelve members of a present-day jury that is hearing a teenage murder case in London's Old Bailey courthouse. Antony Sher (Shakespeare In Love), as coldly calculating and always smiling Prosecuting Attorney Gerald Lewis, is exceptionally riveting. Derek Jacobi (I, Claudius, Gladiator, Gosford Park) gives a warmer, more humane, and often witty performance as Attorney for the Defense, George Cording. Michael Maloney (The Last Place On Earth, Henry V), as high-strung jury foreman Peter Segal, delivers one of the more interesting performances, trying to fend off his ever interfering father-in-law, who is determined to solve the case and influence Peter's vote. Helen McCrory (Anna Karenina, Lucky Jim) as Rose Davies, a woman who is doing jury duty in order to escape a dull and smothering marriage, is also quite interesting, changing her clothes and makeup at the courthouse each day to become a different person from the one she is at home.But the real standout is Gerard Butler (Beowulf And Grendel, Phantom Of The Opera, Dear Frankie) as Johnnie Donne, a recovering alcoholic who has just gotten out of rehab and is unsure if he can emotionally handle a high-profile court case. Halfway through the trial, he finds himself falling in love with Rose, whom he doesn't realize is married, and being punished for it physically by her husband. Things go from bad to worse when Johnnie discovers that Rose is married. But he rises to the occasion in the jury room to convince one of his fellow jurors to cast the deciding vote in the trial. Butler does an exceptional job selling his character and fulfilling all promises in his more emotionally charged scenes. He did this coming off Attila, in which he played the title role - a 180-degree different type character from Johnnie - and one in which he  also excelled. Butler was helped in the role of Johnnie by having struggled with alcoholism in his own life, which he readily is willing to discuss.Some viewers may be disappointed by the visual blandness of THE JURY. It does not hold your attention in that regard. As a matter of fact, I was very disappointed when I first saw it, having become used to such visually stunning British dramas as Horatio Hornblower and Pride And Prejudice. However, what it lacks visually, it pretty much makes up for dramatically. I think I was first pulled into the story by the discussion over the blood-drenched shirt of the defendant versus his red school tie. Which was it that the crossing attendant (the ""lollypop man"") saw? The filmmakers, and the lawyers, handled that question masterfully, and had my respect from that point on.You won't be disappointed.
