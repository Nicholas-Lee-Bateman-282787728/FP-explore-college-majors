His performance in that movie was great, But I think that he really out does himself in this movie. He really is a martial artist and he displays his skills beautifully in blood & bone. If you like UFC or fight movies or even MMA in general you will love this movie. This isn't just a bunch of fight scenes put together, there's an actual story to the movie and everything ties together great! a must for any MMA fan.",5,FINALLY A FIGHT MOVIE WTH STORY TO IT,1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,490,"['first', 'heard', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'Universal', 'Solider', 'Return', 'performance', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'think', 'really', 'out', 'movie', 'really', 'martial', 'artist', 'skills', 'beautifully', 'blood', 'bone', 'like', 'fight', 'movies', 'even', 'MMA', 'general', 'will', 'love', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'bunch', 'fight', 'scenes', 'put', 'together', 'actual', 'story', 'movie', 'everything', 'ties', 'together', 'great', 'must', 'MMA', 'fan']",N/A

I loved it. I wish there was more fighting in it. Actually let me clarify, I wish there was someone to give Michael Jai White's character of ""Bone"" more competition in the film because he just destroys everybody. Seriously, it's crazy how many guys he runs through in the film. That said I want a sequel!!You see this is a martial arts film with some actual heart and soul to it. The story isn't just there to get from fight to fight. It is a cliched plot, but something doesn't become a cliche if it doesn't work. But the plot only gives us a glimpse into the man ""Bone"" and his backstory, and I wanted more just from one line/scene in te film. Without giving anything away because they never elaborate on the issue, at some point in the past ""Bone"" had a twin that was mistakenly killed instead of ""Bone."" This left me wondering why he had a hit out on him. Also we later see he's good with a gun too, and another question arises, why is he so damned proficient at hurting and killing and why was he in jail? These questions are never answered and would make great subject matter for the sequel. Other than that this was a great film to show off exactly what Michael Jai White is capable of. So Please let there be a sequel.",5,"So Good, it NEEDS a Sequel!!",1253232000,"09 18, 2009",2009,1339,"['So', ""'ve"", 'read', 'previous', 'reviews', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'Well', 'will', 'throw', '2', 'cents', 'loved', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'fighting', 'Actually', 'let', 'clarify', 'wish', 'was', 'someone', 'give', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'character', 'Bone', 'more', 'competition', 'film', 'just', 'everybody', 'Seriously', 'crazy', 'how', 'many', 'guys', 'film', 'said', 'want', 'sequel', 'see', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'actual', 'heart', 'soul', 'story', ""n't"", 'just', 'there', 'get', 'fight', 'fight', 'cliched', 'plot', 'something', ""n't"", 'become', 'cliche', ""n't"", 'work', 'plot', 'only', 'glimpse', 'man', 'Bone', 'backstory', 'wanted', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'line/scene', 'te', 'film', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'never', 'elaborate', 'issue', 'point', 'past', 'Bone', 'had', 'twin', 'was', 'mistakenly', 'killed', 'instead', 'Bone', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'had', 'hit', 'out', 'Also', 'later', 'see', 'good', 'gun', 'too', 'question', 'why', 'so', 'damned', 'proficient', 'hurting', 'killing', 'why', 'was', 'jail', 'questions', 'are', 'never', 'answered', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'subject', 'matter', 'sequel', 'Other', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'show', 'off', 'exactly', 'what', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'capable', 'So', 'Please', 'let', 'there', 'be', 'sequel']",N/A
1266878,A3HN7D7HEQGM1R,B002FU8JTW,"Brendan Foy ""Foy""","[0, 1]","I want to just start off and say that this movie is definitely worth checking out.  The action is satisfying with fast and slick martial arts moves, if unrealistic at times.  I am not an MMA buff or a martial arts enthusiast but I have been a sucker for these types of films since American Ninja, Blood Sport and Enter the Dragon first captured my imagination when I was a kid.  I just enjoy seeing an on screen tough guy kicking butt and taking names.Michael Jai White has magnificent screen presence.  He is a tall, muscular, good looking guy with loads of charisma and confidence.  I'm sure he is a big hit with the ladies and his machismo certainly makes him appealing to guys as well, particularly action fans such as myself.  He is clearly an accomplished martial artist (I believe he has 7 black belts) and his movements are so quick and punishing that he looks like a modern Bruce Lee.  I like him a lot and would like to see him get more work, but I have to say that his acting does seem limited from what I have seen him in.  I first remember him from Spawn and have caught his work in several other films as well and the characters he plays really isn't much different than the character he plays in this film.  I'll have to check out Black Dynamite to see how he fairs at comedy but so far he seems to fall back on the same stone faced, man of few words tough guy in most of his films.  In Blood and Bone, I can't recall many scenes where he showed any emotion at all.  Pain, fear and anger would seem like no brainers in a movie like this but there also moments where he could have done a better job at expressing sorrow and anxiety, yet nothing.  His characters have ice water running through their veins and though that may appeal to many writing reviews here, it does not make for a well rounded movie, even a martial arts spectacle like this.Ok so you don't have to be a great actor to make a great martial arts flick, but Michael Jai White seems to suffer from what I call the 'Steven Seagal complex'.  Steven Seagal used to always irritate me in his films because he would never get hurt.  He was untouchable in most of his films, a pony tailed superman who never kicked with his legs.  Guys would attack him one by one and he tossed each of them through a window, one by one.  In this movie, Michael Jai White is indestructable, he can't be touched (though he certainly puts on a much more entertaining show than Seagal ever could).  He beats the crap out of everyone, never breaks a sweat and never looks vulnerable for even the most fleeting of moments.  Chances are the good guy is going to save the day no matter what, but by making this character so untouchable, it removed any tension what so ever these movies usually need to have to stay interesting.  I loved the choreography, but otherwise I found myself bored with the too tough and too cool for school nature of the Michael Jai White character.  Not only does he have complete control over his physical encounters, but he never falters emotionally or psychologically either, he is the perfect specimen!  If he is so perfect, then what the heck was he doing in a Maximum security prison with murderers and rapists in the beginning of the film?  We never get to know this character.  Tony Jaa is my favorite modern martial artist in film, and he combines breathtaking stunts and moves with the right amount of tension and character depth which this movie lacks.Another drawback are the villains in the film, I just didn't hate or fear them enough to the point where I couldn't wait to see Michael Jai White kick the crap out of them.  The main villain is played by the talented Eamonn Walker, of Oz fame, but this character starts to fall apart all too soon in the film.  I pitied him more than anything, which is too bad because Walker definitely has the talent to take a villain to Hannibal Lecter/Joker levels if he only had better writing to work with.I see a lot of the people praising the story in this film but I just don't see where the praise comes from.  It's a razor thin plot focused on revenge.  The hero, as I just talked about, is incredibly one dimensional and every other character in the film other than Eamonn Walker's, a truly gifted actor, is quite shallow.  The plot itself is predictable and the writing at times can be cheesy, though it is engaging enough.  There is also a clear racial subtheme which echoes the black power themes of 70s blaxploitation flicks.  I like this theme in the older blaxploitation movies but it just doesn't quite resonate in this film or in this era.  While watching the movie, I don't recall seeing a single good white male in the entire film.  The one female white lead is purely a sex object and there are plenty of references, verbally or visually, to inequity and inustice.  Eamonn Walker does have a very witty response to a racist remark uttered by a British crime lord that had me laughing out loud though, it was great.  Whatever racial theme the writer may have been trying to put forth really isn't deep enough to resonate with the viewer in my opinion.After watching this film I have decided that Michael Jai White belongs in more movies, but he would make a much better antagonist.  He has such screen presence and looks invincible as soon as he enters a scene that he would make a great villain.  The bad guy, as long as he is not the star of the movie, can be more one dimensional and get away with it.  The whole movie could be spent dreading that final battle between the hero and the seemingly indestructable Michael Jai White.  It actually worked in Universal Soldier: The Return, an otherwise terrible movie that White made watchable.I think as I get older I like my martial arts films a little deeper and a little more complex.  Redbelt is one of my favorites to come out in a long time, but I still enjoyed and definitely recommend Blood and Bone.",3,One of the better DTV releases you will see,1282089600,"08 18,

1266884,A7356DZOBFOJQ,B002FU8JTW,E Rice,"[0, 0]","I'll keep this short.  Blood and Bone is simply amazing and could have easily gone to theaters with movies such as Never Back Down (which I also enjoyed) doing the same.  The story was good enough, better than Never Back Down, but the action is really, really awesome.  MJW is too raw man. He's like a freak of nature.  He's super cut up but so quick and nimble its ridiculous.  He holds 7 blackbelts in real life and you can tell earned every one of them in this movie.Action- The real gem of the movie.  The fight scenes are great, no spectacular, because they are continuously shot (no breaks in between, just pure choreography) and have none of the high wire crap that has become so popular.  The fights look believable and you can tell that all the fighters, not just MJW, are really talented.  My only complaint would be that I wish the end fight sequence was longer, not because it was too short, but rather it was so awesome that I wanted more.  As a martial artist myself I was pleased with the fight scenes. I felt they were realistic enough, not as realistic as Never Back Down (although, those fight scenes were somewhat unrealistic as well).Story/Plot- I don't want to give anything away but like I said it is better than Never Back Down, but not ground breaking in anyway, but who cares, nobody watches these types of movies for a real plot anyway.  My only minor gripe about the story is that they never explained MJW characters origin and how he becomes the ultimate fighter.  Admittedly I know that's really trivial of me, however, MJW character is so ridiculously skilled as a fighter, I couldn't help but wonder who trained this man and how he came to be. Also, MJW manager is hilarious in this movie.Production Values- The production values are surprisingly high for a straight to DVD flick.  I wonder if this movie was initially planned to be released in theaters first, but went straight to DVD later in post-production.Bottom Line- Awesome movie with awesome fight scenes, decent plot, and quality production values.

1266885,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B002FU8JTW,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","This is a street fighter movie through and through. The road map is set, all that needs to be done is to fill in the blanks.Here's the scoop. Bone is in prison. His cell mate is killed and, in his dying word, he asks Bone to take care of his wife and son. Turns out a big player in the street fighting biz, James, set the cellmate up in the first place and put the hit out on him so he could grab the wife. Now she's strung out on horse. Bone enters the street fight game so he can work his way up to fight James' best guy, take the whole mess down, and save mom and the kid. James is trying to elevate himself to the real big white guy outfit so he also sees Bone as a way in.This is a paint by numbers film. You see Bone rent a room in a home that's in a less than nice neighborhood. He strikes up a relationship with the nice landlady and the young boy who is 'waiting for his mom and dad to return.' You see him in an escalating series of fights as he allows himself to be handled by a very colorful manager. All this plays out in standard fashion. So the big things is how will it end? This is peppered with some decent characters. Michael Jai White is good as Bone. Eamonn Walker is also good as James. He's an African American trying to elevate himself above the ghetto. He doesn't swear, drink or do drugs. He wants to be white. Dante Basco, as Bone's manager Pinball, is a real hoot. He's a colorful character who helps break things up and keeps it all from getting too heavy. The other players don't rise much above cardboard cut-outs. The fight scenes are staged well though you've probably seen better. Overall it's directed and cut well. The music is fitting.This movie knows what it has to do and has created the main characters well enough for the viewer to care. Is it good art? Nope. Just good craft but, for a flick like this, that's all you need.

1266888,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B002FU8JTW,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[7, 8]","BLOOD & BONEI have been waiting for a martial arts film or what most call a ""fighting"" movie that actually had a real storyline and interesting characters. After all the searching I finally came across this wonderful piece of filmmaking called ""Blood & Bone"". This movie is very enjoyable with excellent fight scenes, wonderful acting, and a great story behind it all. The great thing is that a review I recently posted I thought the director did not do the greatest job ever [Dragonball Evolution], but he did a great job on this. I may have really got this for Gina Carano who is way to fine and some Mixed Martial Artists this film turned out to be great.Isaiah Bone [Michael Jai White] is a recently released con who is looking to move on with his life. There is only one thing standing in his way of doing that, a jail house promise he made to a now deceased friend behind the walls. James [Eamonn Walker] is a big time hustler on the streets who basically runs every thing for some higher ups; the thing is he has something that is not his. Bone's friend was set up by James in order for James to steal his girl; he is also the guy who had the guy killed in jail. So the only way that Bone knows how to get close to the guy is to enter the street fights in which James manages the champ on the streets, Hammerman [Bob Sapp]. With the help of Pinball [Dante Basco] Bone makes a name for himself leading to a showdown with the man who killed his friend.Michael Jai White who is actually a real martial artist and you may remember from a little film called ""Spawn"" is excellent in this movie. First off his fighting is excellent and is completely realistic even mixing in some jiu-jitsu [love it]. Also and this may surprise some who have not seen him in other things his acting is superb. Eamonn Walker is just as excellent as James the man who had his best friend killed. Julian Sands is great as the man above James; you may remember him from the first two Warlock movies or Stargate SG-1. Dante Basco is very funny in the role of Pinball the man who helps Bone get into the underground fight scene. Nona Gaye is great and gives one of the most realistic performances of the film as the woman who takes Bone in. Michelle Belegrin the sexy wife of James who was stolen away from her real husband is just as good in this film as a junkie.Of course you know that I was all about this film with all the MMA stars that were involved with big Bob Sapp having the most significant role. Sapp plays the Hammerman in this film who is the undefeated street fighter who works for James. Sapp is great in this and as always looks menacing but is also funny. The super hot Gina Carano is just that and super fine all at the same time, she is regulated to a cameo but she straight beats down this one girl. Kimbo Slice who I am now a huge fan of [I used to hate him in Elite XC] actually shows some acting chops in his brief role in this film. Kimbo's role turns really funny during the credits, you will see. Former WCW wrestler and actual martial artist Ernest ""The Cat"" Miller gives a nice performance in his fight with MMA star Maurice Smith who also is good in this. There are more real martial artists in this film and every one in this film is good for their parts.Written by Michael Andrews who like many others involved with this is an actual martial artist did a great job with the story. Director Ben Ramsey who also directed the ""Dragonball Evolution"" film steps up his game with this one delivering a great flick. The acting in this film is great and very believable and the action is just as believable which is usually a problem in these types of films. There is one scene in particular that is a favorite of mine involving James and crew at a dude's house while a certain song is playing. This is a really entertaining movie and I would highly recommend it to any one.",5,FOR THIS TYPE OF FLICK THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST,1254528000,"10 3, 2009",2009,3876,"['BLOOD', 'BONEI', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'what', 'most', 'call', 'fighting', 'movie', 'actually', 'had', 'real', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'characters', 'searching', 'finally', 'came', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'called', 'Blood', 'Bone', 'movie', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'excellent', 'fight', 'scenes', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'thing', 'review', 'recently', 'posted', 'thought', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'greatest', 'job', 'ever', '[', 'Dragonball', 'Evolution', ']', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'may', 'have', 'really', 'got', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'who', 'way', 'fine', 'Mixed', 'Martial', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'great.Isaiah', 'Bone', '[', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', ']', 'recently', 'released', 'con', 'who', 'looking', 'move', 'life', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'standing', 'way', 'doing', 'jail', 'house', 'promise', 'made', 'now', 'deceased', 'friend', 'walls', 'James', '[', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', ']', 'big', 'time', 'hustler', 'streets', 'who', 'basically', 'thing', 'higher', 'ups', 'thing', 'something', 'not', 'Bone', 'friend', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'James', 'order', 'James', 'steal', 'girl', 'also', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'guy', 'killed', 'jail', 'only', 'way', 'Bone', 'how', 'get', 'close', 'guy', 'enter', 'street', 'fights', 'James', 'champ', 'streets', 'Hammerman', '[', 'Bob', 'Sapp', ']', 'help', 'Pinball', '[', 'Dante', 'Basco', ']', 'Bone', 'name', 'leading', 'showdown', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'friend.Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'who', 'actually', 'real', 'martial', 'artist', 'may', 'remember', 'little', 'film', 'called', 'Spawn', 'excellent', 'movie', 'First', 'fighting', 'excellent', 'completely', 'realistic', 'even', 'mixing', 'jiu-jitsu', '[', ']', 'Also', 'may', 'surprise', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'things', 'acting', 'superb', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'just', 'as', 'excellent', 'James', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'best', 'friend', 'killed', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'great', 'man', 'James', 'may', 'remember', 'first', 'two', 'Warlock', 'movies', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'Dante', 'Basco', 'very', 'funny', 'role', 'Pinball', 'man', 'who', 'Bone', 'get', 'underground', 'fight', 'scene', 'Nona', 'Gaye', 'great', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'performances', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'Bone', 'Michelle', 'Belegrin', 'sexy', 'wife', 'James', 'who', 'was', 'stolen', 'away', 'real', 'husband', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'junkie.Of', 'course', 'know', 'was', 'film', 'MMA', 'stars', 'were', 'involved', 'big', 'Bob', 'Sapp', 'having', 'most', 'significant', 'role', 'Sapp', 'Hammerman', 'film', 'who', 'undefeated', 'street', 'fighter', 'who', 'James', 'Sapp', 'great', 'always', 'menacing', 'also', 'funny', 'super', 'hot', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'just', 'super', 'fine', 'same', 'time', 'regulated', 'cameo', 'straight', 'beats', 'down', 'one', 'girl', 'Kimbo', 'Slice', 'who', 'am', 'now', 'huge', 'fan', '[', 'used', 'hate', 'Elite', 'XC', ']', 'actually', 'acting', 'chops', 'brief', 'role', 'film', 'Kimbo', 'role', 'really', 'funny', 'credits', 'will', 'see', 'Former', 'WCW', 'wrestler', 'actual', 'martial', 'artist', 'Ernest', 'Cat', 'Miller', 'nice', 'performance', 'fight', 'MMA', 'star', 'Maurice', 'Smith', 'who', 'also', 'good', 'are', 'more', 'real', 'martial', 'artists', 'film', 'one', 'film', 'good', 'parts.Written', 'Michael', 'Andrews', 'who', 'like', 'many', 'others', 'involved', 'actual', 'martial', 'artist', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'story', 'Director', 'Ben', 'Ramsey', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Dragonball', 'Evolution', 'film', 'up', 'game', 'one', 'delivering', 'great', 'flick', 'acting', 'film', 'great', 'very', 'believable', 'action', 'just', 'believable', 'usually', 'problem', 'types', 'films', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'favorite', 'mine', 'involving', 'James', 'crew', 'dude', 'house', 'certain', 'song', 'playing', 'really', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one']",N/A

It's good thing he passed them so he could be in this.Visceral, vicious, gruelling, brutal, cruel, heart-breaking, yet an understandably sympathetic hero who's an enigma at first then turns out to have a heart of gold with a mission, there was no way I could go wrong with this film. Imagine being an ex-con getting out of jail and getting into the underground fight scene. Yeah, if you anything about the MMA scene (let alone the underground fight scene), you can imagine how brutally vicious the style of the movie would be. Seems like a straightforward B-fighting movie at first, but therein lies the mystery behind the character.There's an equal balance between plot- and character-driven story here that goes beyond most indie-made flicks. Isaiah is a man with a heart of gold and, as time passes, you see it and want to cheer for him. His enemy, a very rich entrepeneur, is pretty much one-dimensional in his tact and style, so you can always tell he'll try to do something devastating, even if you can't tell precisely what it will be everytime.Other characters can have their own style as well, though some, like Pinball, are straight-up out there and seem to know nothing but talk and endlessly jabber on. Then again, towards the end, he shows he can know how to pull off a good thing or two that's helpful.A ""modern western"" as Michael Jai White described in the making-of?

Blood and Bone was definitely cut from a different mold. The plot was great. The actors in the movie were pretty good. The movie contained some comedy, a lot of fighting, some touching moments and a lot of turns and twists that kept my attention piqued. Not to mention I was surprised when I saw Nona Gaye; she's absolutely gorgeous. Anyway, the fight scenes were amazing (simply put). The fight choreography was top notch. Kudos to Michael Jai White; I knew that he knew martial arts but I didn't know that he was doing it like that. He's something else to watch when he's doing his thing. Bottom line, if you like a good martial arts movie with a lot of good fighting and an excellent, touching plot then this movie is for you.

Even though this is direct-to-video it's much more entertaining than most of the crap that gets released theatrically, martial arts or otherwise.  Competently directed and acted, with some sweet fights and a story that I can't say is terrific but definitely good, especially for this demographic.Michael Jai White (""The Dark Knight"", ""Undisputed 2"") tears it up as Bone, an ex-con on a mission to become the king of L.A. street fights... and take care of some personal business along the way.  After convincing a small time promoter (Dante Basco, Rufio from ""Hook"") to get him a money fight, Bone wastes dude after dude, until he has to fight Hammerman, the undefeated monster who fights for the ambitious and philosophical hustler, James (Eamonn Walker, who's fantastic).  James may have some serious investment plans for Bone should he win.I know it doesn't sound original but I loved how the movie has you pulled in for a long time before you understand Bone's motives.  I figured as long as he kept kickin' tail, who cares why he's doing it?The fights credit numerous choreographers but the stunt coordinator is listed as J.J. ""Loco"" Perry, who mastered Michael Jai White and Scott Adkins in the awesomeness that is ""Undisputed 2"", one of the best direct-to-video martial arts flicks that I've ever seen.  I don't think the fights are quite as good here, but definitely worthy of comparison.  In that film White plays a boxer who adopts some MMA techniques, so his leg movements are necessarily limited.  This, however, is the first film where White really gets to show off his stuff as a martial artist and it's about time.  Some fights are better than others but I doubt anyone will complain.  Fast and occasionally quite complex, especially the finale against Matt Mullins.  They could've toned down the amount of spin kicks a little but that's my only real gripe.  Okay, fine; the editing isn't perfect, but when is it?  Still much better than usual.The DVD is distributed by Sony and has LOTS of trailers and a sweet ""behind the scenes"" documentary.  No other special features except for cast and filmmaker commentary.  In English or French with optional subtitles of both languages.  If you like martial arts films this definitely should not be missed.

1266903,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B002FU8JTW,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","Michael Jai White's solo career has been on a role: couple withUndisputed II - Last Man Standingfrom three years before and the simultaneously-releasedBlack Dynamite, the release of ""Blood and Bone"" must have big-name Hollywood studios kicking themselves for not utilizing the man's substantial physical talents for their own benefit. It's another solid notch in a career that seems to be hitting its stride; while I didn't like ""Blood and Bone"" as much as the aforementioned other two titles, it goes to further demonstrate how White has already surpassed the DTV world's other top stars and is fully deserving to be headlining in Hollywood once more.The story: a Los Angeles ex-con (White) enters the world of underground street fighting to fulfill his promise to a dead friend - thereby taking on a ruthless and sadistic gangster (Eamonn Walker,Oz).Top production values are immediately evident and consistent throughout the movie; while it's possible to guess at certain shots that you're watching a DTV film, this one won't alienate Hollywood purists on account of shoddy camerawork or incompetent editing. Director Ben Ramsey (Love and a Bullet) is commendable for really maximizing his resources. It'll depend on your standards if you figure the acting content on-par with the production values, but personally, I remember that this is a low-budget movie and am content with what I get: White is adamantly badass, Eamonn Walker is a thoroughly hateable villain, and Nona Gaye (Ali) and Michelle Belegrin (""Desire"") fill their roles solidly. Julian Sands (Leaving Las Vegas) has a satisfyingly tense exchange with Walker at one point, but I think his secondary villain is kind of redundant and unnecessary. Despite being 35, Dante Basco (Hook) still acts like he's a kid and plays his role as White's sidekick with the same loudmouthed enthusiasm he's known for; decide for yourself if your nerves can handle him.It's safe to say, though, that the movie's fight scenes are what most viewers will be really after. Foremost, I have to point out that even though the movie advertises the presence of legitimate fighters Bob Sapp, Kimbo Slice, Gina Carano, Ernest Miller, and a few others, the vast majority of them are stuck in cameo roles and don't get to show off anything necessarily worthwhile. Sapp is the notable exception, but know that in the face of Michael Jai White, no opponent lasts long or even gets to exert much offense. There are literally only two encounters in which the battle isn't entirely one-sided, and while the predominant one-hit knockouts that Mike bangs out are gloriously athletic, they are but momentary adrenaline rides. The only real standout mano-e-mano match he has is at the end of the movie against up & coming martial artist Matt Mullins, who's done some work prior to this movie (e.g.Adventures of Johnny Tao) but who ought to see his resume expand deservingly now that he has this fight under his belt. On the downside, the awesome Ron Yuan (Ring of Fire) plays an almost completely non-physical role as Walker's right-hand crony. Shame.This movie is as good a place as any for new fans of White to start and for old fans to get back into the game now that their hero has some decent vehicles to his name. While this isn't the all-out actionfest I had been hoping for, it's a perfectly solid action/drama that you don't have to be a devotee to enjoy.

This is the only other movie she has appeared in and she has only one line, delivered after beating another girl fighter to a pulp.So what is the rest of the movie about?  I wasn't expecting much and certainly from a plot perspective, didn't get much.  The staged street fighting scenes on the other hand are first rate and as good as anything you'll see today.  Michael Jae White headlines as Isaiah Bone (OK, whatever you say) who opens the show kicking butt in a prison brawl just before his release.  We never learn why he was in, but I guess it doesn't matter.  He is taken in as a border with a family consisting of an older man, a 30-something woman and several foster children she watches over.Bone's occupation is that of a fighter and he's a good one, quickly dispatching numerous thugs in high stakes street fights.  He comes to the attention of the neighborhood gangsta' chief, named James (Eamonn Walker, TV's ""Chicago Fire"").  He wants him to fight for the really big money ($5 million) against his boss's (Julian Sands) fighter.Bone strings him along but he has other plans.  Let's just say everyone gets what they deserve.  This is all pretty conventional, but when the fighting starts things get interesting.  White obviously has some skills and they are convincingly displayed as he wipes out all-comers including small groups.  The best fight and scene comes at the end when he takes on McVeigh's (Sands) guy.

Yup, it's a straight to video street fighter action film, and plotwise there is zip original about it, but yet.......it's friggin' great!  I've always said you can make a movie about anything, even something that's been done to death, and make it entertaining, because it's all in the presentation.  Here, all the right elements fall into place.First off, many have mentioned(and rightly so) is the performance of Michael Jai White.  Now here is an underrated action star and actor if I ever saw one.  I didn't love Spawn or anything, but White was actually very charismatic in that part.  And lets not forget Black Dynamite, which White also wrote.  He was spot on in that spoof of Blaxploitation.Here he's in the Lionheart/Hard Times role of a guy recently released from the slammer and jumps into the world of illegal street fighting.  Why does he do it?  Ha!  I'm not gonna tell you, but his reasons are a bit different than what you normally see in this kind of film.White pounds the snot out of everyone in his path and attracts the attention of the local mob boss who wants to recruit White for a major bout that will get him into the big time crime syndicate.  Hell, he even goes so far as offering his woman to White!!  White refuses and the screws are tightened on him to go ahead with the bout as there is much at stake.Very, very well done movie.  Again, special mention must be made of White, as he does some incredible martial arts moves in this movie.  The guy is in terrific shape, and he's gotta be in his forties at least(the guy was in Toxic Avenger 2 and 3 for crying out loud).  Acting wise, he's not really called upon to do anything extraordinary, and his character is the typical man-of-few-words buttkicker, but he does lend a bit of realism to it all.  Even the subplot of him romancing his landlord is well handled.Also I gotta mention Eamonn Walker as the villain.  I love this guy.  Ever since I saw him as Kareem Saiid in OZ, and then as Howlin' Wolf in Cadillac Records, I just love this actor.  He makes a great villain here, a real cut above the usual that you would see in this kind of movie.  He is truly threatening and bad to the bone.Julian Sands(another fave of mine) is decent, yet fairly underused as the top dog that Walker is trying to impress.All in all, this movie really entertained me.  With so many films out there like it, you can cut straight through the BS and check this one out, as it definitely deserves your time.  And Michael Jai White definitely deserves more credit!",4,Got Me Bonin',1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,2570,"['Blood', 'Bone', 'truly', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Yup', 'straight', 'video', 'street', 'fighter', 'action', 'film', 'plotwise', 'zip', 'original', 'yet', '.it', 'friggin', 'great', ""'ve"", 'always', 'said', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'anything', 'even', 'something', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'make', 'entertaining', 'presentation', 'Here', 'right', 'elements', 'fall', 'place.First', 'off', 'many', 'have', 'mentioned', 'rightly', 'so', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'Now', 'here', 'underrated', 'action', 'star', 'actor', 'ever', 'saw', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'Spawn', 'anything', 'White', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'charismatic', 'part', 'not', 'forget', 'Black', 'Dynamite', 'White', 'also', 'wrote', 'was', 'spot', 'spoof', 'Blaxploitation.Here', 'Lionheart/Hard', 'Times', 'role', 'guy', 'recently', 'released', 'slammer', 'jumps', 'world', 'illegal', 'street', 'fighting', 'Why', 'do', 'Ha', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'tell', 'reasons', 'are', 'bit', 'different', 'what', 'normally', 'see', 'kind', 'film.White', 'pounds', 'snot', 'everyone', 'path', 'attention', 'local', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'recruit', 'White', 'major', 'bout', 'will', 'get', 'big', 'time', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'Hell', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'offering', 'woman', 'White', 'White', 'refuses', 'screws', 'are', 'tightened', 'go', 'ahead', 'bout', 'much', 'stake.Very', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'Again', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'White', 'incredible', 'martial', 'arts', 'moves', 'movie', 'guy', 'terrific', 'shape', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'forties', 'least', 'guy', 'was', 'Toxic', 'Avenger', '2', '3', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'Acting', 'wise', 'not', 'really', 'called', 'upon', 'do', 'anything', 'extraordinary', 'character', 'typical', 'man-of-few-words', 'buttkicker', 'lend', 'bit', 'realism', 'Even', 'subplot', 'romancing', 'landlord', 'well', 'handled.Also', 'got', 'ta', 'mention', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'villain', 'love', 'guy', 'Ever', 'saw', 'Kareem', 'Saiid', 'OZ', 'then', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'Cadillac', 'Records', 'just', 'love', 'actor', 'great', 'villain', 'here', 'real', 'cut', 'usual', 'would', 'see', 'kind', 'movie', 'truly', 'threatening', 'bad', 'bone.Julian', 'Sands', 'fave', 'mine', 'decent', 'yet', 'fairly', 'underused', 'top', 'dog', 'Walker', 'trying', 'impress.All', 'movie', 'really', 'entertained', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'can', 'cut', 'straight', 'BS', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'definitely', 'time', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'definitely', 'more', 'credit']",N/A

If you have not sinned greatly then God would not have sent a punishment as great such as me."" - Genghis KhanBlending Asian philosophy, hard-hitting fast-paced fight sequences and urban gangster drama, director Ben Ramsey's ""Blood and Bone"" is pretty solid as a martial arts actioner. Despite the unoriginal premise and flimsy plot devices, the film stays aloft with the displays of bloody, brutal fights and the skills of one Michael Jai White (Spawn) who just grabs the screen with his charisma. This is his follow-up to the highly entertaining ""Undisputed 2"" and the man delivers the blows to break the ""bone"".Isaiah Bone (Michael Jai White) is an ex-con who after being paroled, goes on to rent a room in a not-so desirable neighborhood. He hooks up with a small-time street fighting promoter named Pinball (Dante Basco), to conquer the Los Angeles underground street fighting circuit who is ruled by a mob boss named James (Eamonn Walker). Bone goes through the competition one by one, each fight is harder than the one before until he calls attention to himself that James recruits him for the biggest underground pay off of them all; James sets him up to fight against the ""Consortium's"" best fighter. But Bone has a hidden agenda and things aren't the way they seem...""Blood and Bone"" has a plot that is very unoriginal. We've all seen this premise in movies such as ""Lion Heart"", ""Fatal Contact"" and ""Hard Times"" and quite frankly the film offers hardly anything new. An ex-con with a heart of gold who wants to have a shot at redemption and a sleazy selfish gangster who dreams of the real ""big time"" are formulas that have been overused many times. Some details of the plot require a suspension of disbelief and characterization on the part of its supporting characters are very flimsy but the direction covers up the flaws in the script with the way it overloads the screen with numerous exciting fight sequences.Director Ben Ramsey portrays the ""Bone"" character as something out of the pages of a chambara film and spaghetti westerns. The man is an enigma as we really don't know much about him until the second half. He is a fantastic fighter and obviously he is a man on a mission. The plot is a little predictable to those used to these types of films; yet, I found the main character very interesting and thought that the mysteries of his persona to be the film's main strength. We don't really know how he learned to fight like that and he seemed to appear at times when he is needed. Yes, the film leaves a lot of the plot details to the imagination and honestly, some may say that it is lazy storytelling but the direction keeps the pace fairly tight despite the amenities of its plot. The links to Bone and Angela (sexy Michelle Belegrin) is predictable but at least the screenplay doesn't attempt to be pretentious and it only has one goal...to entertain with fight scenes.Now does the film deliver in the fight scenes? Michael Jai White always knew his stuff and I was very impressed with him in ""Undisputed 2""; White doesn't disappoint with this film. For a large man, he is agile and is amazingly quick; and what is more amazing is the fact that he shuns all wire work and does the moves the old-fashioned way, skill. Much of his opponents are your typical street fighters, tough and dirty but most do lack discipline. The last fight with Price (Matt Mullins) was very good and cool in its own way and this was the only time that I felt Bone had the risk of losing. I was a little disappointed that the final fight wasn't as well-choreographed and that the katana sword looked very fake (this is a major sin in action films). Despite the flaw there was no doubt that Bone was going to prevail, this was a good Michael Jai White show.So what makes an action film stay aloft? It usually depends on how convincing the main actor is in the role and White has the appearance of a highly-skilled fighter. The fights were brutal and bloody (some CGI to enhance the old-fashioned gore effects) that action junkies will not be disappointed. ""Blood and Bone"" is a low-budget affair but it isn't your usual ""direct-to-dvd"" popcorn snooze. It plays all its cards right; it doesn't pretend to be anything else and provides solid action entertainment.Recommended!
