1220378,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,B001NNTGFS,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[11, 11]","""The Great Depression"" is a four chapter documentary of the Great Depression during the 1930's.  Each is interesting and can be watched separately as it will take over 3 hours to watch all four.  They are 1) The New Deal, 2)Mass Media, 3) Marathon Dancing, and  4)Hard Times and American Hobo.  This is a great historical time and shows the foundations of many of today's organizations, media and government programs.  The History Channel does an excellent job and Mario Cuomo narrates and introduces each piece - without political coloring.  It is interesting how his family survived during the Depression as well as thrived when the economy recovered.Tidbits learned in the first segment include information about the popularity (and depravity) of dance marathons early in the Depression (45 minutes on, 15 minutes off, with 7 meals a day; they sometimes continued for months), that the Depression prodded many to 'go West' - either in their own autos or through riding the rails (Robert Mitchum James Michener, and Melvin Belli were hobos), and the fact that the Dust Bowl coincided with an worsened the Great Depression. The second segment tells us that movies were a great escape from reality and often had air-conditioning; actors worked very long hours, and movie sales took a two-year dive in 1931. Day labor earned about 50 cents/day. Radio use grew during the Great Depression and FDR made the most of this via his 'Fireside Chats.'I also learned tidbits on where ""Depression Glass"" came from and how it was connected to the movies - eating/drinking items made of glass used to be entirely hand-made and very expensive. However, shortly after the Great Depression began they began making these items with automated machinery, drastically lowering the costs to the point where movie theatres often gave pieces out as enticements.",5,Excellent Background -,1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,1838,"['Great', 'Depression', 'four', 'chapter', 'documentary', 'Great', 'Depression', '1930', 'interesting', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'separately', 'will', 'take', 'over', '3', 'hours', 'watch', 'four', 'are', '1', 'New', 'Deal', '2', 'Mass', 'Media', '3', 'Marathon', 'Dancing', '4', 'Hard', 'Times', 'American', 'Hobo', 'great', 'historical', 'time', 'foundations', 'many', 'today', 'organizations', 'media', 'government', 'programs', 'History', 'Channel', 'excellent', 'job', 'Mario', 'Cuomo', 'narrates', 'introduces', 'piece', 'political', 'coloring', 'interesting', 'how', 'family', 'survived', 'Depression', 'as', 'well', 'thrived', 'when', 'economy', 'recovered.Tidbits', 'learned', 'first', 'segment', 'include', 'information', 'popularity', 'depravity', 'dance', 'marathons', 'early', 'Depression', '45', 'minutes', '15', 'minutes', '7', 'meals', 'day', 'sometimes', 'continued', 'months', 'Depression', 'prodded', 'many', ""'go"", 'West', 'own', 'autos', 'riding', 'rails', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'James', 'Michener', 'Melvin', 'Belli', 'were', 'hobos', 'fact', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'coincided', 'worsened', 'Great', 'Depression', 'second', 'segment', 'tells', 'movies', 'were', 'great', 'escape', 'reality', 'often', 'had', 'air-conditioning', 'actors', 'worked', 'very', 'long', 'hours', 'movie', 'sales', 'took', 'two-year', 'dive', '1931', 'Day', 'labor', 'earned', '50', 'cents/day', 'Radio', 'use', 'grew', 'Great', 'Depression', 'FDR', 'made', 'most', ""'Fireside"", 'Chats', 'also', 'learned', 'tidbits', 'where', 'Depression', 'Glass', 'came', 'how', 'was', 'connected', 'movies', 'eating/drinking', 'items', 'made', 'glass', 'used', 'be', 'entirely', 'hand-made', 'very', 'expensive', 'However', 'shortly', 'Great', 'Depression', 'began', 'began', 'making', 'items', 'automated', 'machinery', 'drastically', 'lowering', 'costs', 'point', 'where', 'movie', 'often', 'gave', 'pieces', 'out', 'enticements']",N/A
1220379,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B001NNTGFS,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[6, 6]","The Great Depression is an informative, educational and even captivating documentary; I learned so much from watching this! Mario Cuomo, former Governor of New York, hosts and sometimes narrates during the archival footage; and there's lots of archival footage at that! There are some re-enactments but it's all very well done. The story of the Great Depression unfolds at a good pace that didn't drag me into boredom; the musical score enhances the film as well.There's so much to learn from watching this film that I scarcely know where to begin. True, some believe this is a type of ode to the liberal FDR administration ""saving"" the country from the Depression; but there are so many stories of people suffering that I don't believe that the film has a true liberal slant. In addition, the film is divided into four parts concerning The New Deal; the effect of mass media on the American people and the role of entertainment at the time. Hoboes riding the rails; labor strikes and often violent confrontations between anguished citizens and police are also highlighted.The film show how ill equipped Hoover was when The Depression began; he tried lowering income taxes but when taxes were only $6 on the average $4,000 per year salary there wasn't much to lower for struggling Americans.  By stark contrast, FDR promised he could solve the economic crisis; and his magnetic personality as opposed to the blame people leveled at Herbert Hoover personally made Hoover an easy target in 1932 and of course as we know FDR won that election in a landslide victory. Even FDR had his problems, though--some of his plans were thrown out by the Supreme Court while others like the NRA were introduced with mixed results.The film covers many different angles of the times; this impresses me. We see political battles including the sobering and most unpleasant effect Huey Long had on numerous other politicians including FDR; and there is a wonderful segment on Dorothea Lange who took so many poignant photographs of people barely surviving during the 1930s, including her very famous photograph of a starving woman in the plains with her two children turning their heads away from the camera. Dorothea got results, too--after that particular incident, within days food was being sent to the makeshift camps where that woman and others were living.There's still much, much more; and all of it is first-rate material. I highly recommend this documentary for anyone studying The Great Depression; the history of the FDR administration and even the Hoover administration; and people who appreciate historical documentaries with social and cultural aspects.",5,The Great Depression ~~ a fine history lesson,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,2648,"['Great', 'Depression', 'informative', 'educational', 'even', 'captivating', 'documentary', 'learned', 'so', 'much', 'watching', 'Mario', 'Cuomo', 'former', 'Governor', 'New', 'York', 'hosts', 'sometimes', 'narrates', 'archival', 'footage', 'lots', 'archival', 'footage', 'are', 're-enactments', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'story', 'Great', 'Depression', 'good', 'pace', 'did', ""n't"", 'drag', 'boredom', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'well.There', 'so', 'much', 'learn', 'watching', 'film', 'scarcely', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'True', 'believe', 'type', 'ode', 'liberal', 'FDR', 'administration', 'saving', 'country', 'Depression', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'stories', 'people', 'suffering', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'film', 'true', 'liberal', 'slant', 'addition', 'film', 'divided', 'four', 'parts', 'concerning', 'New', 'Deal', 'effect', 'mass', 'media', 'American', 'people', 'role', 'entertainment', 'time', 'Hoboes', 'riding', 'rails', 'labor', 'strikes', 'often', 'violent', 'confrontations', 'anguished', 'citizens', 'police', 'are', 'also', 'highlighted.The', 'film', 'show', 'how', 'ill', 'equipped', 'Hoover', 'was', 'when', 'Depression', 'began', 'tried', 'lowering', 'income', 'taxes', 'when', 'taxes', 'were', 'only', '6', 'average', '4,000', 'year', 'salary', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'lower', 'struggling', 'Americans', 'stark', 'contrast', 'FDR', 'promised', 'could', 'solve', 'economic', 'crisis', 'magnetic', 'personality', 'opposed', 'blame', 'people', 'leveled', 'Herbert', 'Hoover', 'personally', 'made', 'Hoover', 'easy', 'target', '1932', 'course', 'know', 'FDR', 'won', 'election', 'landslide', 'victory', 'Even', 'FDR', 'had', 'problems', 'though', 'plans', 'were', 'thrown', 'out', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'others', 'NRA', 'were', 'introduced', 'mixed', 'results.The', 'film', 'many', 'different', 'angles', 'times', 'see', 'political', 'battles', 'including', 'sobering', 'most', 'unpleasant', 'effect', 'Huey', 'Long', 'had', 'numerous', 'other', 'politicians', 'including', 'FDR', 'wonderful', 'segment', 'Dorothea', 'Lange', 'who', 'took', 'so', 'many', 'poignant', 'photographs', 'people', 'barely', 'surviving', '1930s', 'including', 'very', 'famous', 'photograph', 'starving', 'woman', 'plains', 'two', 'children', 'turning', 'heads', 'away', 'camera', 'Dorothea', 'got', 'results', 'too', 'particular', 'incident', 'days', 'food', 'was', 'being', 'sent', 'makeshift', 'camps', 'where', 'woman', 'others', 'were', 'still', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'first-rate', 'material', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'anyone', 'studying', 'Great', 'Depression', 'history', 'FDR', 'administration', 'even', 'Hoover', 'administration', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'historical', 'documentaries', 'social', 'cultural', 'aspects']",N/A
