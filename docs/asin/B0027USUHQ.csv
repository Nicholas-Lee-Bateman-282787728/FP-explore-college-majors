This DVD offers a sweat-inducing workout of a yoga practice that WILL help you lose weight. If you can stay focused throughout, it is also a great yoga practice, but the pace is a challenge, at least for me. She also offers an interesting set of wall exercises towards the end. The production quality of this DVD is better than most yoga video material.

1254445,A2ZAOT2HEBQOUW,B0027USUHQ,Eva H.,"[1, 1]","One of the best features of this DVD is the modularity. It offers around 10 modules from which you can configure your own workout, according to your own personal preferences and time availability. The feature allows you to get a very calm, no heart-pumping yoga session and heart racing, vigorous workout from the same DVD, depending on which modules you choose to combine.I tried Sadie's Youtube videos, yoga sequences for weight loss many time, before purchasing this DVD. Sadie uses many of her 'signature' moves she uses in the Youtube videos such as the ""Shakti kicks"", extending of a leg in downface dog etc. in this DVD. I was impressed by the vigorousness of these Youtube workouts and proceeded to buy this DVD.It may be my body that has adjusted to the level of these workouts, but I don't seem to get the same heart pumping workout experiences from doing the workouts in the DVD as I used to from Sadie's Youtube videos. I was interested in yoga to tone my body rather than calm my mind down or heighten spirituality. So now I have moved on from this yoga video to another one, ballet conditioning.Though I don't expect to use the DVD very often in the future, while it lasted (2 months), this DVD helped me to strengthen physiques and add more flexibility.",4,"Modular DVD, Strengthening Yoga",1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,1268,"['One', 'best', 'features', 'DVD', 'modularity', '10', 'modules', 'can', 'configure', 'own', 'workout', 'according', 'own', 'personal', 'preferences', 'time', 'availability', 'feature', 'get', 'very', 'calm', 'heart-pumping', 'yoga', 'session', 'heart', 'racing', 'vigorous', 'workout', 'same', 'DVD', 'depending', 'modules', 'choose', 'combine.I', 'tried', 'Sadie', 'Youtube', 'videos', 'yoga', 'sequences', 'weight', 'loss', 'many', 'time', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'Sadie', 'many', ""'signature"", 'moves', 'Youtube', 'videos', 'such', 'Shakti', 'kicks', 'extending', 'leg', 'downface', 'dog', 'etc', 'DVD', 'was', 'impressed', 'vigorousness', 'Youtube', 'workouts', 'proceeded', 'buy', 'DVD.It', 'may', 'be', 'body', 'adjusted', 'level', 'workouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'same', 'heart', 'pumping', 'workout', 'experiences', 'doing', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'used', 'Sadie', 'Youtube', 'videos', 'was', 'interested', 'yoga', 'tone', 'body', 'rather', 'calm', 'mind', 'down', 'heighten', 'spirituality', 'So', 'now', 'have', 'moved', 'yoga', 'video', 'one', 'ballet', 'conditioning.Though', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'use', 'DVD', 'very', 'often', 'future', 'lasted', '2', 'months', 'DVD', 'helped', 'strengthen', 'physiques', 'add', 'more', 'flexibility']",Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga: Total Body Transformation and Weight Loss with Sadie Nardini

I have been seriously practicing ashtanga yoga for a couple of years now, and thought this would be a good variation to my practice Well it is and it isnt. It is a good workout, but not a good ""yoga"" workout. The moves involve multiple repetitions of challenging (in terms of strength) positions and really does get you sweating, yet it feels very little like yoga the way I know it. The positions are challenging in the sense of requiring a lot of strength and stamina but I never get the feeling it is doing anything for me at a deeper level.

1254448,A127MY5UD6ZJM6,B0027USUHQ,"R. Goss ""rgoss99""","[3, 3]","I first encountered Sadie Nardini's Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga DVD after moving to another city in late 2008 and not being able to find a decent vinyasa yoga instructor or class. After several months of frustration, I turned to Amazon for help and ended up purchasing a number of highly recommended DVDs.Although I've had different degrees of success with each of the DVDs I've bought and really enjoy some of the practices, there are none that I've found as consistently good as this one. Being as I'm not the most flexible guy or experienced yoga student in the world, Sadie's practices provided an appropriate level of challenge without going beyond a level that I'm not capable of. In fact, I think I'm better at yoga now BECAUSE of doing these routines.Mind you, this DVD has some really challenging parts, and I can't say that I am yet able to do everything on it. But even so, there's enough diversity here for me to customize my practice--and whenever I get to a point where I feel really challenged, she always seems to know when to let off and bring me back into my comfort zone while helping me stretch and unwind the targeted areas in a suitable manner.I might add that it's not a perfect DVD. There are a few flaws here and there. Her oral coaching, for instance, sometimes differs from what's on the screen by several seconds, and the timing of how long she works out each side, left and right, is occasionally off by quite a bit as well. But these imperfections, to my mind, are minor when compared with the many benefits this DVD offers.If you have practiced yoga before and have at least some degree of balance, flexibility and general yoga knowledge, then I would highly recommend this DVD. It may take you a few playings to find out which rewards work best for you, but the reward for the research you do will be well worth the effort in the long run.",5,Still my favorite home yoga DVD,1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,1870,"['first', 'encountered', 'Sadie', 'Nardini', 'Core', 'Strength', 'Vinyasa', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'moving', 'city', 'late', '2008', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'decent', 'vinyasa', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'class', 'several', 'months', 'frustration', 'turned', 'Amazon', 'help', 'ended', 'up', 'purchasing', 'number', 'highly', 'recommended', 'DVDs.Although', ""'ve"", 'had', 'different', 'degrees', 'success', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'really', 'enjoy', 'practices', 'are', 'none', ""'ve"", 'found', 'consistently', 'good', 'one', 'Being', ""'m"", 'not', 'most', 'flexible', 'guy', 'experienced', 'yoga', 'student', 'world', 'Sadie', 'practices', 'provided', 'appropriate', 'level', 'challenge', 'going', 'level', ""'m"", 'not', 'capable', 'fact', 'think', ""'m"", 'better', 'yoga', 'now', 'doing', 'DVD', 'really', 'challenging', 'parts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'am', 'yet', 'able', 'do', 'everything', 'even', 'so', 'enough', 'diversity', 'here', 'customize', 'practice', 'whenever', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'feel', 'really', 'challenged', 'always', 'know', 'when', 'let', 'off', 'bring', 'back', 'comfort', 'zone', 'helping', 'stretch', 'targeted', 'areas', 'suitable', 'manner.I', 'might', 'add', 'not', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'are', 'few', 'flaws', 'here', 'there', 'oral', 'coaching', 'instance', 'sometimes', 'differs', 'what', 'screen', 'several', 'seconds', 'timing', 'how', 'long', 'out', 'side', 'left', 'right', 'occasionally', 'off', 'quite', 'bit', 'as', 'well', 'imperfections', 'mind', 'are', 'minor', 'when', 'compared', 'many', 'benefits', 'DVD', 'offers.If', 'have', 'practiced', 'yoga', 'have', 'least', 'degree', 'balance', 'flexibility', 'general', 'yoga', 'knowledge', 'then', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'may', 'take', 'few', 'playings', 'find', 'out', 'rewards', 'work', 'best', 'reward', 'research', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'effort', 'long', 'run']",Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga: Total Body Transformation and Weight Loss with Sadie Nardini

My favorite pose is moving half-moon where you do half moon on each side and then curl down to bent knee forward bend and then stretch open to half moon on the opposite side.
