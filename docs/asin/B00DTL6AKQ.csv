He does a great job of playing a spastic neurotic boss in this series.  There's so many funny things that he does that just crack me up. I've never seen him playing a part like this and he does it so well that I hope he comes across another part like this. He's got great comedic timing.This series has the regular cast of good and bad guys.  Bad guys and girls that turn good.  Evil rich people.  You know, the usual cast of characters for a K-drama.  Park Shi Hoo's character throws in enough wackiness amongst the seriousness that it's very refreshing to see.  Plus, I loved the bunnies!  I want a set of them!I watched this on the internet and decided that I needed to get the dvd's.  Today, my region free blu-ray player arrived so I will be able to watch it in a better format.  I hope the subtitles are translated as well as they were online.  Sometimes they differ.I'm so excited to see it on my big screen TV and not the smaller pc monitor.",5,Great K-drama Series!,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,1011,"['love', 'Park', 'Shi', 'Hoo', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'series', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'spastic', 'neurotic', 'boss', 'series', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'things', 'just', 'crack', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'playing', 'part', 'so', 'well', 'hope', 'part', 'got', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing.This', 'series', 'regular', 'cast', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'Bad', 'guys', 'girls', 'turn', 'good', 'Evil', 'rich', 'people', 'know', 'usual', 'cast', 'characters', 'K-drama', 'Park', 'Shi', 'Hoo', 'character', 'enough', 'wackiness', 'seriousness', 'very', 'refreshing', 'see', 'loved', 'bunnies', 'want', 'set', 'watched', 'internet', 'decided', 'needed', 'get', 'dvd', 'Today', 'region', 'free', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'arrived', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'better', 'format', 'hope', 'subtitles', 'are', 'translated', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'online', 'Sometimes', 'differ.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'TV', 'not', 'smaller', 'pc', 'monitor']","Cheong Dam Dong Alice(Korean drama, Region 3 DVD!)"

It's an interesting description of the class system. Not sure if it represents actual discrimination in Korea or if this is totally fiction. About an hour into it, I was fully engaged in watching it. It made the fashion industry interesting too. At first I thought I was watching a Korean version of, The Devil Wears Prada. It was a fun romance to watch with a little mystery thrown in.",4,It's Good But A Little Goofy,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,497,"['version', 'saw', 'was', 'Netflix', 'had', 'English', 'subtitles', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'third', 'way', 'interesting', 'description', 'class', 'system', 'Not', 'sure', 'actual', 'discrimination', 'Korea', 'totally', 'fiction', 'hour', 'was', 'fully', 'engaged', 'watching', 'made', 'fashion', 'industry', 'interesting', 'too', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'Korean', 'version', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'was', 'fun', 'romance', 'watch', 'little', 'mystery', 'thrown']","Cheong Dam Dong Alice(Korean drama, Region 3 DVD!)"
1661197,A3L4DIB3CUWTII,B00DTL6AKQ,LoveBug,"[0, 1]","Han Se Kyung is a fledgling fashion designer, but can't get hired because her outward appearance and schooling show she comes from a poor family. She finally gets hired, but her dream job ends up being a go-to-assistant for the company president's wife, her high school enemy.Han Se Kyung believes love can get people through anything, even a substantial amount of debt. But her attitude soon changes. When her current boyfriend leaves her and runs off with her money, she decides to get help from her high school enemy and land a rich husband and become a ""cheongdam-dong"" daughter-in-law. (trophy wife) The man she plans to pursue (her white rabbit) is an eccentric CEO of an expensive clothing store. While pursuing her white rabbit, Han Se Kyung has another shot at love. Which puts her at a crossroads. Should she choose money or love? Or is there a possibility of getting both?I love the main actress in this drama, but the show itself was creative, but alright. Mostly because of two reasons. First, it was only 16 episodes, but the drama seemed drawn out. Second, I personally didn't care for the main actor. His cheerful, giddy, and eccentric personality was too over the top to my liking, even though his character was supposed to be that way. But because of his way too cheery take on the character and his facial expressions I didn't think the main characters made a good romantic couple. Their relationship didn't feel believable to me. It felt more like a nice brother-sister friendship. Plus the kissing romantic scenes were a bit pathetic and disappointing until the very, very end of the drama. One of the most anticipated moments of a good romantic drama is the first kiss scene, right? (*spoiler) - The first kiss was just a very quick peck on the lips with no deep emotion. This also contributed to what I didn't like about the show.However, I'm glad I watched this drama. The main actress was still awesome and the other characters were great. I liked the ""Alice in Wonderland"" ""white rabbit"" reference on the show. I would still recommend watching this. I just personally didn't care for the main actor in this particular role.",3,"Pursue the ""White Rabbit""",1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,2149,"['Han', 'Se', 'Kyung', 'fledgling', 'fashion', 'designer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'hired', 'outward', 'appearance', 'schooling', 'show', 'poor', 'family', 'finally', 'hired', 'dream', 'job', 'up', 'being', 'go-to-assistant', 'company', 'president', 'wife', 'high', 'school', 'enemy.Han', 'Se', 'Kyung', 'love', 'can', 'get', 'people', 'anything', 'even', 'substantial', 'amount', 'debt', 'attitude', 'soon', 'changes', 'When', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'off', 'money', 'get', 'help', 'high', 'school', 'enemy', 'land', 'rich', 'husband', 'become', 'cheongdam-dong', 'daughter-in-law', 'trophy', 'wife', 'man', 'pursue', 'white', 'rabbit', 'eccentric', 'CEO', 'expensive', 'clothing', 'store', 'pursuing', 'white', 'rabbit', 'Han', 'Se', 'Kyung', 'shot', 'love', 'Which', 'crossroads', 'Should', 'choose', 'money', 'love', 'possibility', 'getting', 'love', 'main', 'actress', 'drama', 'show', 'was', 'creative', 'alright', 'Mostly', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'was', 'only', '16', 'episodes', 'drama', 'seemed', 'drawn', 'out', 'Second', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'main', 'actor', 'cheerful', 'giddy', 'eccentric', 'personality', 'was', 'too', 'top', 'liking', 'even', 'character', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'cheery', 'take', 'character', 'facial', 'expressions', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'main', 'characters', 'made', 'good', 'romantic', 'couple', 'relationship', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'believable', 'felt', 'more', 'nice', 'brother-sister', 'friendship', 'kissing', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'were', 'bit', 'pathetic', 'disappointing', 'very', 'very', 'end', 'drama', 'One', 'most', 'anticipated', 'moments', 'good', 'romantic', 'drama', 'first', 'kiss', 'scene', 'right', '*spoiler', 'first', 'kiss', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'quick', 'peck', 'lips', 'deep', 'emotion', 'also', 'contributed', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'show.However', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'drama', 'main', 'actress', 'was', 'still', 'awesome', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'great', 'liked', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'white', 'rabbit', 'reference', 'show', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'watching', 'just', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'main', 'actor', 'particular', 'role']","Cheong Dam Dong Alice(Korean drama, Region 3 DVD!)"
1661198,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00DTL6AKQ,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","CHEONG DAM DONG ALICE is one of the most intricately plotted movies I have ever seen. Based loosely on themes from Carroll's novel ALICE IN WONDERLAND, this movie portrays the results that inevitably occur when a starry-eyed dreamer leaves the safety of the ""real"" world to pursue the imagined delights looming at the end of the rabbit hole. In this case Cheong Dam Dong is the real life glitzy center of Seoul's elite who work and live in near fantasy level of existence that places a sign at the door: ""All Ye Who Were Not Born Rich Do Not Even Think To Enter."" But one such dreamer does dare to enter Han Se Kyung (Moon Geun-Young), a fashion designer who applies for a job as a designer of elite clothes only to find that her real duty is to be a gofer. Apparently, hard work and determination are insufficient to gain entrance to the Inner Circle of the glittery people, but she soon notices that her new boss Seo Yoon-Joo (So Yi-Hyun) has somehow miraculously done exactly that. In high school Se Kyung and Yoon-Joo were bitter rivals but Yoon-Joo soon agrees to help her by telling her that for a poor working girl to hit the big time, she must find a ""white rabbit"" a rich man she can marry. The first half of the 16 episode series centers on the mental adjustments that Se Kyung must make as she chooses her own white rabbit Cha Seung Jo (Park Shi Hoo), a wealthy scion whom she views as her next meal ticket. The second half shifts focus from the grubby reality that underlies the surface glitziness of Cheong Dam Dong to the philosophical mushiness that inevitably entraps all those who, like Yoon-Joo and Se Kyung, seek to debase themselves by looking only at the goal of success (marriage to a white rabbit) and ignoring the price.Part of the enjoyment I found in CHEONG DAM DONG ALICE was the gradual unveiling of the inner turmoil of those who succeeded in gaining entrance only to find that gaining entrance does not equate to gaining acceptance by those who were born to the elite life. Yoon-Joo has been married for three years to her own rabbit and in her initial hostility to Se Kyung I thought that she was the wicked Red Queen, but the truly wicked Red Queen was her own sister-in-law Shin In Hwa (Kim Yoo Ri) who has long despised Yoon-Joo as a ""water snake"" gold digger. As the series moves toward the end, the film implies that it is far better to live in a world of poverty-stricken half-reality than to enjoy the comfort of a totally unreal world of opulent riches that at any moment may pull the plug even from one like Yoon-Joo who thought her position secure. CHEONG DAM DONG ALICE is a stern reminder to anyone who seeks entrance past the velvet rope of No Trespassing. Getting past that rope has many totally predictable perils. Just ask Yoon-Joo.",5,Feed Your Head,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,2779,"['CHEONG', 'DAM', 'DONG', 'ALICE', 'one', 'most', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Based', 'loosely', 'themes', 'Carroll', 'novel', 'ALICE', 'IN', 'WONDERLAND', 'movie', 'results', 'inevitably', 'occur', 'when', 'starry-eyed', 'dreamer', 'safety', 'real', 'world', 'pursue', 'imagined', 'delights', 'looming', 'end', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'case', 'Cheong', 'Dam', 'Dong', 'real', 'life', 'glitzy', 'center', 'Seoul', 'elite', 'who', 'work', 'live', 'near', 'fantasy', 'level', 'existence', 'sign', 'door', 'Ye', 'Who', 'Were', 'Not', 'Born', 'Rich', 'Do', 'Not', 'Even', 'Think', 'Enter', 'one', 'such', 'dreamer', 'dare', 'enter', 'Han', 'Se', 'Kyung', 'Moon', 'Geun-Young', 'fashion', 'designer', 'who', 'job', 'designer', 'elite', 'clothes', 'only', 'find', 'real', 'duty', 'be', 'gofer', 'Apparently', 'hard', 'work', 'determination', 'are', 'insufficient', 'gain', 'entrance', 'Inner', 'Circle', 'glittery', 'people', 'soon', 'notices', 'new', 'boss', 'Seo', 'Yoon-Joo', 'So', 'Yi-Hyun', 'somehow', 'miraculously', 'done', 'exactly', 'high', 'school', 'Se', 'Kyung', 'Yoon-Joo', 'were', 'bitter', 'rivals', 'Yoon-Joo', 'soon', 'help', 'telling', 'poor', 'working', 'girl', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'must', 'find', 'white', 'rabbit', 'rich', 'man', 'can', 'marry', 'first', 'half', '16', 'episode', 'series', 'centers', 'mental', 'adjustments', 'Se', 'Kyung', 'must', 'make', 'own', 'white', 'rabbit', 'Cha', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'Park', 'Shi', 'Hoo', 'wealthy', 'scion', 'whom', 'next', 'meal', 'ticket', 'second', 'half', 'shifts', 'focus', 'grubby', 'reality', 'surface', 'glitziness', 'Cheong', 'Dam', 'Dong', 'philosophical', 'mushiness', 'inevitably', 'entraps', 'who', 'Yoon-Joo', 'Se', 'Kyung', 'seek', 'debase', 'looking', 'only', 'goal', 'success', 'marriage', 'white', 'rabbit', 'ignoring', 'price.Part', 'enjoyment', 'found', 'CHEONG', 'DAM', 'DONG', 'ALICE', 'was', 'gradual', 'unveiling', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'who', 'succeeded', 'gaining', 'entrance', 'only', 'find', 'gaining', 'entrance', 'not', 'equate', 'gaining', 'acceptance', 'who', 'were', 'born', 'elite', 'life', 'Yoon-Joo', 'been', 'married', 'three', 'years', 'own', 'rabbit', 'initial', 'hostility', 'Se', 'Kyung', 'thought', 'was', 'wicked', 'Red', 'Queen', 'truly', 'wicked', 'Red', 'Queen', 'was', 'own', 'sister-in-law', 'Shin', 'Hwa', 'Kim', 'Yoo', 'Ri', 'who', 'long', 'despised', 'Yoon-Joo', 'water', 'snake', 'gold', 'digger', 'series', 'end', 'film', 'far', 'better', 'live', 'world', 'poverty-stricken', 'half-reality', 'enjoy', 'comfort', 'totally', 'unreal', 'world', 'opulent', 'riches', 'moment', 'may', 'pull', 'plug', 'even', 'one', 'Yoon-Joo', 'who', 'thought', 'position', 'secure', 'CHEONG', 'DAM', 'DONG', 'ALICE', 'stern', 'reminder', 'anyone', 'who', 'entrance', 'velvet', 'rope', 'Trespassing', 'Getting', 'rope', 'many', 'totally', 'predictable', 'perils', 'Just', 'ask', 'Yoon-Joo']","Cheong Dam Dong Alice(Korean drama, Region 3 DVD!)"
