It was not the huge success that some of the others have been, and I can understand why.  No &quot;Silly Songs&quot;, no opening segment with Larry and Bob, etc. (Though I loved the opening sequence showing the children of Veggie Tales employees).  Instead, this particular Veggie Tale tells a straigtforward Bible story, one especially loved by Christians and Jews alike, namely, the story of Esther -- the Queen who saved her people.Like other Veggie Tales, the humor is on two levels.  Kids will enjoy the songs and animation; adults will appreciate the &quot;godfatheresque&quot; storytelling, accents, emphasis on &quot;family&quot; and the like.The producers of Veggie Tales took a risk with this one -- and to my mind, succeeded in their purpose.

I remember thinking &quot;Man, when is something FUN going to happen??!&quot; Big Idea does capture the meaning of the Esther story (and, by the way, I kinda figured out that our Veggie-Esther was a wild onion, but it took me a few minutes), but unlike all the other videos, this one just wasn't fun. I'm not sure why this one didn't turn out as well as all the others...perhaps they were just too busy working on &quot;321 Penguins,&quot; but I have no idea how much merit that has since I have yet to watch it. Of course, perhaps I'm putting a little too much emphasis on all this, seeing as how I'm a 20 year old college student with no children, but I guess everyone needs a diversion.

I was extremely excited about this one with &quot;Esther&quot; in particular, because it would have a female lead character.  [I am the mom of a little girl, and that's my only real complaint about VeggieTales - hardly any female main characters.  Laura the Carrot is the only recurring female really, and she gets very little air time compared to the guys.  Since I'm trying to raise a devout Christian woman, I'd like some help with a couple of female role models!].How sad I was when I bought this one though - the female lead, Esther, is a whiny, pouty, obnoxious little thing [and I can't even identify her as an actual vegetable - she looks more like a green stick to me].  The wonderful VeggieTale format has been altered with this one [no intro with Bob and Larry, no Silly Song, no closing comment from Querty], much to the detriment of this video, in my opinion.  The whole tone of this story is very dark compared to the others, and there are two scenes that include a very scary Grim Reaper who comes out with a feather to take the 'bad guys' to the &quot;Island of Perpetual Tickling&quot;.  The Grim Reaper scared my two year old to tears, however, and now she screams &quot;No, I'm scared of the Tickling Guy!&quot; and cries if we try to watch Esther again.  Not a big plus.There are some good things about this one however - the animation in particular is spectacular.  Also, Pa Grape makes a great showing as Esther's wise cousin Malachai, Mr. Lundt is a very entertaining villian, and Mr. Nezzer as the King is wonderful as well.I wouldn't neccessarily reccommend Esther - and definitely I'd get all the other VeggieTales first, but this one is probably worth owning for a die hard Veggie Fan.",2,A Big Dissappointment [I regret to say],975196800,"11 26, 2000",2000,1848,"['really', 'hate', 'say', 'thought', 'Esther', 'was', 'huge', 'dissappointment', '*adore*', 'VeggieTales', 'own', '[', 'love', ']', 'was', 'extremely', 'excited', 'one', 'quot', 'Esther', 'quot', 'particular', 'would', 'have', 'female', 'lead', 'character', '[', 'am', 'mom', 'little', 'girl', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'VeggieTales', 'hardly', 'female', 'main', 'characters', 'Laura', 'Carrot', 'only', 'recurring', 'female', 'really', 'very', 'little', 'air', 'time', 'compared', 'guys', ""'m"", 'trying', 'raise', 'devout', 'Christian', 'woman', ""'d"", 'like', 'help', 'couple', 'female', 'role', 'models', ']', '.How', 'sad', 'was', 'when', 'bought', 'one', 'female', 'lead', 'Esther', 'whiny', 'pouty', 'obnoxious', 'little', 'thing', '[', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'identify', 'actual', 'vegetable', 'more', 'green', 'stick', ']', 'wonderful', 'VeggieTale', 'format', 'been', 'altered', 'one', 'intro', 'Bob', 'Larry', 'Silly', 'Song', 'closing', 'comment', 'Querty', ']', 'much', 'detriment', 'video', 'opinion', 'whole', 'tone', 'story', 'very', 'dark', 'compared', 'others', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'include', 'very', 'scary', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'who', 'out', 'feather', 'take', ""'bad"", 'guys', 'quot', 'Island', 'Perpetual', 'Tickling', 'quot', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'scared', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'tears', 'however', 'now', 'screams', 'quot', 'No', ""'m"", 'scared', 'Tickling', 'Guy', 'quot', 'cries', 'try', 'watch', 'Esther', 'again', 'Not', 'big', 'plus.There', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'one', 'however', 'animation', 'particular', 'spectacular', 'Also', 'Pa', 'Grape', 'great', 'showing', 'Esther', 'wise', 'cousin', 'Malachai', 'Mr.', 'Lundt', 'very', 'entertaining', 'villian', 'Mr.', 'Nezzer', 'King', 'wonderful', 'well.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'neccessarily', 'reccommend', 'Esther', 'definitely', ""'d"", 'get', 'other', 'VeggieTales', 'first', 'one', 'probably', 'worth', 'owning', 'die', 'hard', 'Veggie', 'Fan']","VeggieTales - Esther, The Girl Who Became Queen VHS"

Instead, the video focuses completely on the story of the girl picked to be queen who discovers God has placed her there in order to save her people.

I completely missed the references to ""The Godfather,"" but as others have mentioned, this explains the reference to ""family"" and not ""the Jews"" in the story line.  While I missed the ""Silly Songs with Larry"" segment, it would have broken the flow and tone of the story, and I'm glad it was left out.  Instead, we have the hilarious ""Lost Puppies"" song from the audition scene.  And Esther gets several great songs.

563733,AENS008HCBVC5,B000051WAF,Theodore Illenberg,"[1, 1]","Esther, The girl who became queen is a retelling of the story of Esther for children. Like the other veggietales videos it presents difficult biblical topics in a a fun way at a child's level. The story is about a young Hebrew girl who becomes the wife of the King of Persia. Esther is witnessing her people being persecuted.This veggietales story tells how God has a plan for his people and he will always be their to protect them eventhough they might not see it. This is a very tough concept that is presented to children in a way that they can understand. Many children today are going through difficult times. Many children come from broken homes and since September 11th many children are fearful of terrorist attacks. It is hard to see God's perpose through all these bad things. The story of Esther shows that God does care and he has a plan for everyone.I was fortunate to able to attend the Intervarsity Urbana Missions Conference in '87 and again in '93. During the 1987 conference one of the main speakers stated that we cannot readily see God's plan for us but he shows us enough to be able to take one step then shows us enough to take another step.This is the message of Esther, in that God plan for us my not be totally clear but he is there to guide oursteps. This veggietales video shows that God is faithful to those who are obediant to him and he gives his people encouragement to fullfill the plan that he has for each and everyone of us.",4,Good Biblical Message,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,1459,"['Esther', 'girl', 'who', 'became', 'queen', 'retelling', 'story', 'Esther', 'children', 'other', 'veggietales', 'difficult', 'biblical', 'topics', 'fun', 'way', 'child', 'level', 'story', 'young', 'Hebrew', 'girl', 'who', 'wife', 'King', 'Persia', 'Esther', 'witnessing', 'people', 'being', 'persecuted.This', 'veggietales', 'story', 'how', 'God', 'plan', 'people', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'protect', 'might', 'not', 'see', 'very', 'tough', 'concept', 'presented', 'children', 'way', 'can', 'understand', 'Many', 'children', 'today', 'are', 'going', 'difficult', 'times', 'Many', 'children', 'come', 'broken', 'homes', 'September', '11th', 'many', 'children', 'are', 'fearful', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'hard', 'see', 'God', 'perpose', 'bad', 'things', 'story', 'Esther', 'God', 'care', 'plan', 'everyone.I', 'was', 'fortunate', 'able', 'attend', 'Intervarsity', 'Urbana', 'Missions', 'Conference', ""'87"", 'again', ""'93"", '1987', 'conference', 'one', 'main', 'speakers', 'stated', 'can', 'not', 'readily', 'see', 'God', 'plan', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'one', 'step', 'then', 'enough', 'take', 'step.This', 'message', 'Esther', 'God', 'plan', 'not', 'be', 'totally', 'clear', 'there', 'guide', 'oursteps', 'video', 'shows', 'God', 'faithful', 'who', 'are', 'obediant', 'people', 'encouragement', 'fullfill', 'plan', 'everyone']","VeggieTales - Esther, The Girl Who Became Queen VHS"

The Animation in this video, like all the veggie tales vidoes, is outstanding almost on a par with the best of disney. The tittle Character is a bit oddly drawn however. After trying to figure what kind of veggitable she was I settled on a weirdly shaped string bean. She is a whiny weakling kind of character with a lack of depth but that is a valid part of the story, she is an ordinary girl who is thrown into extra ordinary circumstances. The video does suffer from not having Bob and Larry as well as Qwerty. And finaly I was very confused by the Grim Reeper with the feather (What kind of mixed message is that?) Having said all of that, this is still better than most of the junk that passes itself off as kid videos theses days. While there are some funny lines in the video and a few funny sight gags (Such as an early mass trasinit system with the slogan &quot;Why wait for the A.D.&quot;) it is far from the funniest veggie Tales, worth buying but disappointing coming from veggietales.",4,Good but not the best Veggietale,976406400,"12 10, 2000",2000,1091,"['critisisms', 'prior', 'reviews', 'Esther', 'are', 'valid', 'perhaps', 'little', 'over', 'stated', 'Animation', 'video', 'veggie', 'vidoes', 'outstanding', 'almost', 'par', 'best', 'disney', 'tittle', 'Character', 'bit', 'oddly', 'drawn', 'however', 'trying', 'figure', 'what', 'kind', 'veggitable', 'was', 'settled', 'weirdly', 'shaped', 'string', 'bean', 'whiny', 'weakling', 'kind', 'character', 'lack', 'depth', 'valid', 'part', 'story', 'ordinary', 'girl', 'who', 'thrown', 'extra', 'ordinary', 'circumstances', 'video', 'suffer', 'not', 'having', 'Bob', 'Larry', 'as', 'well', 'Qwerty', 'finaly', 'was', 'very', 'confused', 'Grim', 'Reeper', 'feather', 'What', 'kind', 'mixed', 'message', 'Having', 'said', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'junk', 'off', 'kid', 'videos', 'days', 'are', 'funny', 'lines', 'video', 'few', 'funny', 'sight', 'gags', 'Such', 'early', 'mass', 'trasinit', 'system', 'slogan', 'quot', 'Why', 'wait', 'A.D.', 'quot', 'far', 'funniest', 'veggie', 'Tales', 'worth', 'buying', 'disappointing', 'coming', 'veggietales']","VeggieTales - Esther, The Girl Who Became Queen VHS"
