The leading characters are superb and it is a fantastic story of love and devotion; not sex.  VERY well photographed, directed, produced and scripted.  Music superb.  The acting is grade A; the story modern and moving. Best of all, it does all of this without having to descend into bare skin (a plus or minus depending upon what you want for the evening).

While surfing the internet, he stumbles across an ad for a new ""app"" called ""eCupid,"" which is ""guaranteed"" to find your true love.  He downloads it, but, when the screen blanks out, assumes it didn't work.  He soon finds out that eCupid is at work, significantly more intrusive and controlling of his life than he ever imagined it could be.  But, perhaps, that could be what he needs?It's a cute idea, working as a gay dating fantasy, as well as a tongue-in-cheek satire about how Smartphone ""apps"" and chronic texting have taken over some people's lives.  More than anything else, it celebrates the value of relationships, and is an excellent film to show to mixed gay/straight audiences. The musical score is refreshingly good, and it features a talented young cast, and you may glimpse a couple of familiar faces, including a gay member of ""The Real World: DC"" cast and the hunky Irish guy on ""TMZ on TV.""  There's also Morgan Fairchild, in a scene-stealing role as a coffee shop waitress.From the writer-director who gave us the entertaining ""Is It Just Me?"" and the amusing web series ""Steamroom Stories.""

Calciano, Is It Just Me?, but I have to admit it was a little low budget and you could see it. In eCupid this perception is almost nada, and almost everything is perfect, from the chosen cast to the setting to the music. True, there are some gay stereotypes, the frat boy, the party boy, the twink, the buddy friend, but no one of them is exaggerated, or depicts in a way that is offensive, it's more a way for the main character to realize he is in love with his boyfriend, and that he has to do everything he can to mend the break between them.Gabe has few to do on his side, since, from how I see it, he only tried to not overcome his lover with his trouble, when he knew Marshall had few of his own. Gabe is sweet and kind, and really the perfect boyfriend. Marshall is simply having a 7 years scratch itch, and with the intervention of a very useful Apps, eCupid, he will understand how stupid he has been.Houston Rhines, in the role of Marshall, is perfect, if not a little ""couch potato"", meaning that he is waiting for the solution to come to him and not viceversa. He is not that bad, but he has to grow a back bone ;-) said that he is cute, and he really doesn't do anything to alienate his sweet boyfriend, and so he has the right to have him back.Noah Schuffman as Gabe is more than cute, and he is also sweet and kind, and yes, sexy, way sexier than all the other men Marshall will meet. He is the right catch, and rightly, once he is ""temporarily"" free, he will have the line in front of him.eCupid is so good I can see it out of the gay themed indie circuit to try the mainstream circuit.",5,eCupid (2012) directed by J.C.

Obviously, his casting personnel have done their best to provide us with cute and hunky co-leads, as well as a fun group of major supporting actors (mention of some, below).  It was a rare moment when their character arcs didn't ring true (obviously, the writing helped here).  As to Storyline, it's as much one of ""today's world"" as it could possibly be....giving us an enjoyable ride and any number of lessons to be learned.BUT having said all that, a large reservation remains for me....and it involves the Romantic angle of a story like this.  So let me be the Bad Guy in this group and explain my last statement in the following way:Some pre-release photo shots and a preview trailer led this Fan to believe, or hope, that our Good Director Calciano had perhaps read and paid attention to a past review of mine (""Is It Just Me?""), in which I took he and other Gay Romance film directors to task for NOT providing realistic kissing scenes.  About his last film's attempts, I basically stated:  ""Blink and you'll miss 'em.""  ....And STILL, in this latest work, it seems if you ""double-blink,"" you'll miss 'em.  Maybe that's because our two ""eCupid"" lead actors give little more than quick pecks on the lips or cheek (surely not a case of:  ""Folks will think I'm Gay""!?).  Though I must concede that Frat-Boy Dawson was really ""persistent"".....and fellow worker, Keith (Matt Lewis, in an exciting performance) gave his lip-lock a really good shot.Other main supporting actors of note include Andy Anderson (Chris 1).....and of course, the inestimable Morgan Fairchild, as the Divinity Drive-In's Mother Confessor....and Guru of Love (she probably even out-angels Gabriel in this film).Now, let's hope there is some ""learning"" being derived from reviews put out there by nonprofessional guys such as you and I.  Let's also hope for better film productions in future.  (Still and all, I'd buy another of this Director's films.)By George...I think I've got it!  I believe I'll just close out these comments with my parting review words re: our Director's last film:""So, how to end all this? Let me do it by asking: Is it fun and cute and attention-holding? Well, yes....for the most part. But that doesn't mean it couldn't have been better....and my rating reflects that. (And yes, yes, yes....I have watched it more than once before butting in).""",4,Directors should heed their Fan's reviews at.......,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,2591,"['such', 'elsewhere.And', 'yes', 'let', 'get', 'right', 'there', 'up', 'front', 'well-done', 'production', 'Calciano', 'very', 'good', 'surrounding', 'capable', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'folks', 'little', 'fault', 'Obviously', 'casting', 'personnel', 'have', 'done', 'best', 'provide', 'cute', 'hunky', 'co-leads', 'as', 'well', 'fun', 'group', 'major', 'supporting', 'actors', 'mention', 'was', 'rare', 'moment', 'when', 'character', 'arcs', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'obviously', 'writing', 'helped', 'here', 'Storyline', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'today', 'world', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', '.giving', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'number', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned.BUT', 'having', 'said', 'large', 'reservation', '.and', 'Romantic', 'angle', 'story', 'let', 'be', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'group', 'explain', 'last', 'statement', 'following', 'way', 'pre-release', 'photo', 'shots', 'preview', 'trailer', 'led', 'Fan', 'believe', 'hope', 'Good', 'Director', 'Calciano', 'had', 'perhaps', 'read', 'paid', 'attention', 'past', 'review', 'mine', 'Just', 'Me', 'took', 'other', 'Gay', 'Romance', 'film', 'directors', 'task', 'NOT', 'providing', 'realistic', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'last', 'film', 'attempts', 'basically', 'stated', 'Blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', '.And', 'STILL', 'latest', 'work', 'double-blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'Maybe', 'two', 'eCupid', 'lead', 'actors', 'give', 'little', 'more', 'quick', 'pecks', 'lips', 'cheek', 'surely', 'not', 'case', 'Folks', 'will', 'think', ""'m"", 'Gay', 'must', 'concede', 'Frat-Boy', 'Dawson', 'was', 'really', 'persistent', '..and', 'fellow', 'worker', 'Keith', 'Matt', 'Lewis', 'exciting', 'performance', 'gave', 'lip-lock', 'really', 'good', 'shot.Other', 'main', 'supporting', 'actors', 'note', 'include', 'Andy', 'Anderson', 'Chris', '1', '..and', 'course', 'inestimable', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'Divinity', 'Drive-In', 'Mother', 'Confessor', '.and', 'Guru', 'Love', 'probably', 'even', 'out-angels', 'Gabriel', 'film', '.Now', 'let', 'hope', 'learning', 'being', 'derived', 'reviews', 'put', 'out', 'there', 'nonprofessional', 'guys', 'such', 'Let', 'also', 'hope', 'better', 'film', 'productions', 'future', 'Still', ""'d"", 'buy', 'Director', 'films', 'George', 'think', ""'ve"", 'got', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'just', 'close', 'out', 'comments', 'parting', 'review', 'words', 're', 'Director', 'last', 'film', 'So', 'how', 'end', 'Let', 'do', 'asking', 'fun', 'cute', 'attention-holding', 'Well', 'yes', '.for', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'mean', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', '.and', 'rating', 'yes', 'yes', 'yes', '.I', 'have', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'butting']",eCupid

And to have Marshall allow himself to be essentially bullied by an app just seems a little too weird for me. If he really was that shallow, then who would actually to be in a relationship with that kind of a guy?The acting was a little flat, admittedly, with many of the supposedly comedic scenes somehow not playing how quite right from a timing perspective. It's hard to say precisely if it's all because of acting being less that what was needed or if they somehow lacked direction - it was probably an odd mix of both.For many queer fans, the real gem of the movie was the involvement of Morgan Fairchild who was both the voice of eCupid and another character later on - I won't tell you who. Oh yes, we love our icons and to be fair, she still looks quite stunning regardless of your sexual orientation. And in a way, her involvement in this movie seemed as ethereal and magical as eCupid itself.On the whole, the movie still has a decent message even though it has a somewhat roundabout way of telling it. Then again, if you've watched enough romantic comedies in your life, then you can pretty much predict the movie's almost fairy tale ending.eCupid could have been so much more, I feel, but it's still better than most of the mindless pink flicks that come out.

1508773,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0062QHZJU,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[0, 0]","Yes another gay rom com and if that is your bag then this sort of delivers. The plot is that Marshall (Houston Rhines) is approaching 30 and a mid life crisis with equal tenacity. This is not helped by his boyfriend of seven years Gabriel (Noah Scuffman) who is working so hard at his cafe that all he wants to do is come home and go to bed, to sleep that is. Marshall is a semi unsuccessful advertising exec and starts to hate his job along with his situation, his boss though gets some of the best one liners, that would get him in an employment suit as quick as you can say `outdated bigot' - brilliant.So with no bed time activity other than snoring on the menu, Marshall plays with his mobile phone, and gets to download a free app. This is eCupid, where love is guaranteed. Then stuff starts to happen and he goes from being terminally frustrated to the centre of the gay universe pretty much over night.This has a fair few laughs and a big moralistic tale written all over its assured face. From director J.C. Calcianno (`Is it just me?') this is well acted and directed and has some very easy on the eye moments, mind you we do get two of the most lack lustre gogo boys ever, but I can forgive them that as it is supposed to be lunchtime (where is this bar?). It does come across as predictable, but also very warm, I wish there really was such an app and I'd be down the Smart phone shop quicker than a prize winning thorough bred. We also have a shoe horned cameo from Morgan Fairchild and bless her for adding some down at heart glamour as Venus the waitress who oozes old world charm and homely advice.This won't really get your pulse racing, it won't change your life but you might get a nice warm feeling and enjoy a genuinely nice gay movie.",4,Gay Rom Com that is as predictable as it is fun,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,1756,"['Yes', 'gay', 'rom', 'com', 'bag', 'then', 'sort', 'delivers', 'plot', 'Marshall', 'Houston', 'Rhines', 'approaching', '30', 'mid', 'life', 'crisis', 'equal', 'tenacity', 'not', 'helped', 'boyfriend', 'seven', 'years', 'Gabriel', 'Noah', 'Scuffman', 'who', 'working', 'so', 'hard', 'cafe', 'do', 'come', 'home', 'go', 'bed', 'sleep', 'Marshall', 'semi', 'unsuccessful', 'advertising', 'exec', 'hate', 'job', 'situation', 'boss', 'best', 'one', 'liners', 'would', 'get', 'employment', 'suit', 'as', 'quick', 'can', 'say', 'outdated', 'bigot', 'brilliant.So', 'bed', 'time', 'activity', 'other', 'snoring', 'menu', 'Marshall', 'mobile', 'phone', 'download', 'free', 'app', 'eCupid', 'where', 'love', 'guaranteed', 'Then', 'stuff', 'happen', 'being', 'terminally', 'frustrated', 'centre', 'gay', 'universe', 'pretty', 'much', 'night.This', 'fair', 'few', 'laughs', 'big', 'moralistic', 'tale', 'written', 'assured', 'face', 'director', 'J.C.', 'Calcianno', 'just', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'very', 'easy', 'eye', 'moments', 'mind', 'do', 'get', 'two', 'most', 'lack', 'lustre', 'gogo', 'ever', 'can', 'forgive', 'supposed', 'be', 'lunchtime', 'where', 'bar', 'come', 'predictable', 'also', 'very', 'warm', 'wish', 'really', 'was', 'such', 'app', ""'d"", 'be', 'down', 'Smart', 'phone', 'shop', 'quicker', 'prize', 'winning', 'thorough', 'bred', 'also', 'have', 'shoe', 'horned', 'cameo', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'bless', 'adding', 'down', 'heart', 'glamour', 'Venus', 'waitress', 'who', 'old', 'world', 'charm', 'homely', 'advice.This', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'pulse', 'racing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'life', 'might', 'get', 'nice', 'warm', 'feeling', 'enjoy', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'gay', 'movie']",eCupid
