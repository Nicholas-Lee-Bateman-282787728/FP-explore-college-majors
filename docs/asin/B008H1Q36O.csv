I fell sound asleep during it, and when I tried to watch the rest it fried my DVR ...It's ... just awful.  Not fun awful.  It's just ... something a relative would 'create' and you have to dutifully sit through it.There's this dog who 500 years ago helped his owner kill Dracula, the last vampyre (who nobody in this world has apparently heard of) and got bit by Vlad Tepes by mistake, and has been living with the descendants of the owner for centuries.  The last guy dies and sends Fang (clever, eh?) to go live with the new owner, a 12 year old kid (who looks disturbingly like Jessica Alba) who just moved to Moose Jaw with his widowed mother.You see, there's this school, and it's going to be closed, and only she can save it by revitalizing it's music program (which consists of 12 bored kids that can't play a note) so it can win the battle of the bands, at which point it will become a charter school and live forever.  The principal is trying to foil this and force the school to close for reasons never revealed to us.  To this end he's apparently hired the kid's mom to save the music program even though that's the exact opposite of what he wants.  Much much later in the film, he's offered a bribe to close the school by someone he's never met before, so we still don't know why he wanted to close it before, and we never find out why the evil woman that bribed him wants it closed, either.Said evil woman is trying to create a go away wrinkles product that she's already presold millions of units to KillMore Cosmetics (that's the biggest laugh to be found here) and somehow realizes that she needs the DNA of a vampire dog to complete the formula and luckily the only one there is just moved to Moose Jaw ... the dog needs to eat 'Red Jelly' constantly (apparently in Canada they call Jello 'Jelly' and 'Red' is a flavor)  New kid is the bestest drummer of them all but can't play in front of other people, and his new friend Skye is the science wiz who realizes that all Fang needs to do to run in the sunlight is take over the counter generic allergy medication (and why he eats Red Jelly).  Lots of action takes place in the school lunch kitchen, which is just a regular kitchen with one stove/oven and two lunch ladies.The kid tells Fang not to ever talk in front of his mother ... for no reason whatsoever.  The mean girls win the battle of the bands so for the most part, evil triumphs, and the school they hate is saved.  The principal is fired and the evil cosmetics woman and her goofy assistant arrested by the cop on charges of 'chasing kids around'  It's never made clear why they don't just offer the kid $5 for some dog DNA - it's not like they want it for any bad reason, it's just wrinkle cream, and they don't want a sample of brain tissue or anything.  From the writer of ... hmm, she has no other credits of any kind whatsover, and from the director of ... some special FX work on Tru Calling.  The dog's voice is the worst part; the Skye actress is the best.

1553002,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008H1Q36O,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[0, 0]","I guess I need to be wary of movies that use the word ""dog"" in their titles, it just might represent truth in advertising! What do you think about when you hear ""Vampire Dog?"" Right away, I conjured dozens of wacky sight gags, silly puns, and ridiculous spoofs. Just the notion of this dog having vampiric tendencies (even comical ones) opens up a myriad of mental images and potentially humorous situations. The problem with ""Vampire Dog"" is that its screenplay is so lazy, it never makes a convincing argument that Fang (the doggie in question, voiced by Norm MacDonald) is supernatural or even special. It cracks wise, to be sure, but is never particularly funny. What makes it a vampire exactly? Apparently it's very old, comes from Transylvania, moves like lightning, and consumes red jelly (this is actually Jello, but I guess they couldn't afford brand royalties). That's the back story of Fang in a nutshell.Fang is taken in by an awkward youth (Collin MacKechnie). The primary message of the movie is that it's okay to be yourself. While that's always a welcome inspiration, a little cleverness in the telling would have been greatly appreciated. In addition to helping MacKechnie fit in at school (and score his first girlfriend), the plot also has a couple of evil scientists pursuing the canine. These two bumble along in slapstick scenarios to get close to Fang in order to develop an anti-aging technology. At best, it's mildly amusing. At worst, it's the sloppiest kind of filmmaking. At times, whole scenes seem to be missing as the action isn't tied together in any tangible way. One example: the bad guys are shown approaching Fang's house one evening. The scene then cuts away, and never returns to this action. Later, though, Fang says something like ""oh, it's you guys again"" when encountering the duo. But they've never interacted before! Another example: MacKechnie's girlfriend hears Fang speak and thinks it's ventriloquism. There is a cut-away and in the next conversation, she is having a heart to heart with the dog about his past. Huh? Just how much of this movie was left on the cutting room floor?I could go on and on about the screenplay's inconsistencies. Fang can't be in sunlight but he's outside in dozens of scenes. That's another winner. The dialogue is leaden and the performances are wooden. A complete misfire on almost every level, the only time I laughed were during the outtakes over the end credits. I never expected ""Vampire Dog"" to be a great movie, but I had hoped to be somewhat entertained. If you're going to take a silly premise, just run with it! It would have been easy to make this fun, clever, and/or outrageous. It's none of those things, unfortunately. It's a cheapie production that might be passable for free on Saturday morning TV for very young children. I don't suspect, however, that the little ones will be clamoring for repeat DVD viewings.
