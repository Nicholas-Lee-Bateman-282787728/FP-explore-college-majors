1535198,A3G2MJPURQSCBD,B007OAAK0O,Big Miles Davis Fan,"[0, 0]","In this video the concert in New York's Central Park was scheduled for a Thursday evening in the summer of 1983. The concert began in clear weather and, according to radio commentary, was attended by a crowd of 800,000- said to be the largest in the history of the park. Diana Ross first appeared in a beautiful bright orange body suit that fit tightly- a leotard. She then added a cape that fluttered in the strong wind which rushed in seemingly out of nowhere and followed quickly by a heavy down pour. The thunderstorm forced the show to end. If the first day's performances actually lasted 45 minutes we have about 15 minutes only of that at the beginning of this DVD, including TV news video clips and commentary about the event. Miss Ross kept her promise to the crowd to return the next day. Friday brought bright sunshine throughout.Of the many concert DVDs that I own this is the one about which I can state emphatically that much of the audio is out of sync with the video. It does get better towards the end (or is it rather that I adjusted to it?) but if you've watched TV with the audio muted while you played another thing (a music CD, for example) you did that for a reason- your attention was divided. Watching this DVD will similarly divide your attention between audio and video; it is distracting.Considering the age of the original material that was just released on DVD the picture quality is quite impressive. Diana put on a very good show and the DVD gives us 25 chapters of it. The camera focused mostly on Miss Ross but also on the large crowd. Band and any background singers were hidden from view until the very end.The original two channel audio was well distributed into all seven loud speakers of my sound system even if it did not sound as crisply as DTS audio does- (I am yet to find a Shout Factory concert DVD with DTS audio). This is a concert that cries out for release as a blue-ray disk with audio flaws corrected.

But enough with audience participation. Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh. The greatest concert ever on Earth is Diana Ross' ""The Boss"" concert in 1979 from Caesar's Palace. This concert, in 1983 I believe, was good, but for the fact that she stopped singing and asked the audience to finish verses and stanzas. Enough audience participation already. If she just asked the audience to sing on ""Reach Out and Touch Somebody's Hand"" like she did in the 79 concert, that would have been fine. But on every song? I did not buy this dvd(actually I bought 2, in case one gets worn) to hear the audience sing on every song. Diana stopped singing on so many of her hit songs, and held the mic out for the audience to finish verses. The throngs loved her almost as much as I did(do).This is the only reason I gave this dvd 3 stars, not her performance. Her performance was five stars. The quality of the dvd was five stars. I was into every song. I love Diana Ross.

Miss Ross has performed better shows, but the legacy of this show is the most lasting of any of her performances. Its a great time capsule, a superb reflection of where music and Miss Ross were in 1983. This show was an enormous gamble, a testament to the ability of the superstar to realize her dreams. The viewer should remember that she was less than 3 years removed from her risky move to leave Motown, was a single Mom with 3 girls, and had a lot to lose if this show would not have been pulled off. She battled not only the elements but the odds in pulling this off, more than just pulling it off, Diana Ross created a moment that is instantly identifiable in the world of popular entertainment.Film critic Pauline Kael once said that Diana Ross' efforts to star in THE WIZ may have been the single most dramatic example of will ever exhibited by a movie star.

1535210,A3SR2FSNU40ZSD,B007OAAK0O,"L. Boki ""L. Boki""","[52, 57]","When it was first announced that Diana would join the short list of exclusive artists to perform in Central Park. Diana was riding a 5 year wave of uptrending popularity from her critically acclaimed/platinum album, ""The Boss"", to the mega-success of the Chic produced ""diana"" album that went onto sell 10 million copies globally, followed closely by what Billboard has declared some 30 years later, ""The Biggest Duet of AllTime"" w/""Endless Love"" to her platinum RCA/EMI debut, ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love"", it's follow-up the near platinum ""Silk Electric"" with the Michael Jackson written and produced single, ""Muscles"" to the album that would spearhead this global concert, ""Ross '83"". (Diana was already one of those rare artists to have her career be ever stronger in its third decade. The Supremes dominated the charts from 1964-1970. Then Diana's first solo surge happened  immediately in 1970 when the Grammy nominated ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" would be her first solo #1. Then her movie career blossomed from 1972-76 as she got an Oscar nod for ""Lady"" and a French Cesar for ""Mahogany"". This next surge began in 1979 with ""The Boss"").Throughout the 70s and early 80s, Diana Ross concerts were like love-ins. It seemed no matter what you had felt about her and/or body of work, she had a unique gift to entertain audiences into gleeful nirvana. She had been a pupil of Werner Earhard's ""EST"" which seem to draw her even closer to her audiences. I imagined Central Park to be a great big love-in. I had been traveling annually to New York since 1972/73. I had the privilege of seeing her at Radio City a number of times before this engagement. I  thought I knew New York. But a decade later, there were clearly a lot of things I needed to learn. Her audiences were usually comprised of about 60% white, 20% black and 20% multi-racial. Though the Chic produced ""diana"" album stayed ontop of the Billboard R&B; Album chart for nearly 18 weeks, her core audiences were not black. Arriving at the park by noon on 21 July 1983, the park was already beginning to fill up for a show not scheduled to start until dusk, 6:00 p.m. The audience was already heavily populated with her black and Hispanic fans. Even the normally strong alliance with the LGBT community was not as evident as it usually was.It was an extremely hot July day with a powerful sun beaming down. To keep the burgeoning crowd entertained, they attempted to show ""Lady Sings the Blues"" on the jumbotron. However, the bright sun made it difficult to always see the screen. Radios were blasting Diana songs. Industrious New Yorkers were selling ice cubes and water to the sweltering audiences. When she finally hit the stage at around 6:00 p.m., the wind was beginning to whip up. The dancers on stage struggled through the wind as Diana's hair blew wildly in the wind. The first highlight was a touching rendition of ""Family"" from ""Dreamgirls"". New Yorkers knew the cast album, but, were pleasantly surprised that Diana had included this in the repertoire despite all the gossip that Diana had ""issues"" with the award winning Broadway show. The wind continues to blow wildly. The audiences continued to mimmick the wind. Wild is the wind! And then seemingly out of nowhere, a dark cloud began to dominate the New York skies. For the first half hour, Diana tried admirably to confront mother nature......only to have the weather make the definitive statement. The rain followed and it only got stronger and stronger. The New York audiences seem to join Diana in defying mother nature. Would the rain ""Stop! in the name of Love"" or would Diana urge her audience to, ""Come in from the Rain"". Even if you are Diana Ross, you don't mess with mother nature. (I truly believed the rain had to happen to diffuse the electricity of the wild audience).The Supremes medley during the rain ranks as one of her most compelling performances. She improvised brilliantly! She remained true to ""The show must go on"" and she created an iconic moment that will forever be branded into our entertainment psyche. (even her staunchest critics could not deny that the lady seemed to get more and more beautiful as the rain poured down. One marywilson commented enviously that her Lancme make-up did not run at all though the rain came down furiously).The next day, she returned to that stage completely re-energized. The setlist was altered from the day before. Opening with the appropriate ""I'm Coming Out"", she was determined to fully entertain the 400,000 plus that either returned for more or decided to join in the celebration now that the show was being rescheduled. Highlights include the second single, ""Let's Go Up"" that sounded like a #1 record as the colorful balloons floated up the sky. When she sung, ""God Bless the Child"", her conviction to the lyrics rivaled her performance of that song during her 1980 HBO special. This time, it sequed into a scorching version of ""Mirror, Mirror"" that may be the most commanding performance of the day. She kept things contemporary offering a fun take on Michael Sembello's ""Maniac"" from the 80s blockbuster, ""Flashdance"". When she returned to the stage in a breathtaking Issey Miyake yellow ensemble, she made Stevie Wonder's recent, ""Ribbon in the Sky"" her own.... underscoring yet another turn of his catalog that begs for her to do an album of Stevie's songs.....she does them so well. As she toyed with her recent Top 10, ""Muscles"".....audience participation got very comical. She even got the New York Police involved in the fun antics to ""Muscles"". Her solo version of ""Endless Love"" was combined with the duet version and it moved the diva to real emotional tears. You could not help but wonder if she was reflecting on the roller coaster ride of the last couple of days or simply touched by the fact that she had kept her end of the bargain, and gave New York one of the most memorable Central Park concerts. Whether you believe the adjusted report that she pulled in an audience of 400,000 or you believe like I did and the New York Daily News reported that the first day commanded over 800,000 fans.....the fact that 400,000 returned for the encore underscored that she drew the biggest audience ever to Central Park.....a record that still stands today (though the Park Commissioner no longer allows random attendance, and  capacity taps out at 100,00. Tickets are allocated before hand to insure crowd control). This was truly an event! It is hard to believe it was 30 years ago because Diana looks as vibrant today, as she did then. It is one of Diana's finest hours, in a career with many. In fact, nearly 20 years later, she gave another astounding New York performance in tribute to the 20th anniversary of ""Lady Sings the Blues"" at her pay-per-view, ""Stolen Moments"" concert at the old New York Ritz. Clearly, New York is her town and this show proves it undoubtedly. It is finally here and somehow it seems like the right time!",5,It's Taken Nearly a Lifetime BUT It is Finally Released!,1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,6947,"['When', 'was', 'first', 'announced',

But, Diana Ross, being the 'true' professional that she is was determined to stay ON STAGE and perform to the HUGE flock that attended and what a HUGE flock it was.  As the CROWD roared the RAIN poured and finally someone had the sense to stop the show so that no one would get hurt, including Diana Ross.She agreed to come back the following day and do it all over again...only this time with PLENTY of SUNSHINE pouring down upon her along with much adulation from the crowd.  And what a crowd it was and what a show it was ~ memorable to say the least.

Isn't it ironic that the first concert begins and ends with this song?  Or maybe it's poetic justice which describes how the wind and the rain do stop Ms. Ross and this first concert.  Perhaps it's an act of God. So we have a new song or play of sorts being enacted, live from New York, staged at Central Park where no man, no woman, including Ms. Ross, can stand against the forces of nature.What actually happens to end the first shortened concert so abruptly?First, it starts to rain, but Ms. Ross continues to perform.  Then, even though the wind is strong enough to push Ms. Ross back, Ms. Ross continues to perform.  Finally, the strong winds and heavy rains force Ms. Ross to stop the show.  As this short concert ends, Ms. Ross makes a promise to return the next day.The next day is a new day, bright, and sunny - a day full of promise.  Ms. Ross returns to fulfills her promise. In this second and lengthened concert, she is  energetic, sexy, emotional, classy, and professional.Both concerts have huge numbers of people gathered at Central Park, along with a heavy police presence, ""the boys in blue"".  It's interesting to watch the dynamics between the police and the public, with Ms. Ross as the moderator.  She uses tact and wisdom in dealing with the audience, giving instruction when necesssary.The DVD video quality is not the same as a new DVD today.  The quality is the same as watching a regular standard television in 1983.  The audio is also not like a CD.

But not Diana Ross  :)The 2nd concert is great, but the concert during the storm makes this DVD outstanding documentation of a major event and demonstration of the qualities that made Diana Ross a long time superstar.Ms. Ross' talent and her genuine love for her audience, and them to her, are apparent in both shows.  But in the first show, we see it all....the Diva....as the wind keeps blowing hair in her face, she turns to the wind and says ""cool it"".....the business woman giving onstage direction to stagehands ....her sense of drama as she throws her arms up to the storm....the guardian of her audience as she safely directs them from the park and ..yes...her temper...yelling to the NYC Policemen to stop pushing.  (The next day, she thanked and flirted with them from the stage)But Diana Ross can't stop the storm and it finally must end.  She stays on stage while the audience leaves, watching her lifelong dream of doing a great outdoor concert melt.  That's when she throws caution to the wind and says, ""We'll do this again tomorrow.""And so the show does go on ...the next day...on a beautiful day with a cloudless sky.  Diana Ross is at one of her many career peaks...riding off her hit album with CHIC's producers and signing one of the biggest recording contracts up to that time.  Her energy, talent and beauty are all great.  But again, it's the connection between Diana Ross and the audience...strong and loving...which is so amazing.Incredibly, the concert was not fully appreciated in its time. Because a second show was added, the concert made no profits, which were promised to the city to build a playground in Central Park. The NYC Mayor, Ed Koch,  publicly complained  that Diana Ross did not follow through on the deal, despite the cost to the city to stage the concert.  Ultimately, Diana Ross paid the city $250,000 (approximately $500,000 in today's dollars)and the Diana Ross playground was built.  Luckily, now that the controversy is fully gone, we have this dvd to fully appreciate the concert.A few years ago, I read someone spotted Diana Ross sitting in the playground that bears her name, in sunglasses, alone, no one approaching. So, the writer went up to her and said, ""Thank you"".  Whether true or not, I wonder what Ms. Ross would be thinking while she was sitting in the playground..was it of the cheering crowd, or asking ""Where Did Our Love Go?"" or continuing optimism in the face of life's storms.In any case... ""Thank you, Ms. Ross""  and from all your fans, the love is still there.",5,"WOW!!!!

Unfortunately the concert was not registered on DVD as a result of the bancrupcy of the organisation. The dvd is good in sound and picture, but it is very nineties! No grand stageworks, but a simple concert. Nowadays the artists perform their songs at live concerts with the same punctuality as a studio recording. In the seventies and eighties during the live concerts, the songs would be pitched up, like as twice the speed. I still don't understand why.

I'm surprised at how well the tape was kept in great condition for the transfer they used. i don't know for sure if this was at all remastered, or if it was in digital format, but it looks great after all these years. please pick this up.Diana Ross:Live in Central Park",5,My review.,1337558400,"05 21, 2012",2012,1797,"['one', 'have', 'bothered', 'writing', 'up', 'kind', 'review', 'owning', 'DVD', 'so', 'here', 'DVD', 'case', 'strong', 'sturdy', 'DVD', 'front', 'cover', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'can', 'see', 'photos', 'back', 'little', 'bit', 'concert', ""'ve"", 'already', 'uploaded', 'photos', 'back', 'DVD', 'insert', 'DVD', 'insert', 'DVD', 'cover', 'case', 'art', 'dual', 'sided', 'where', 'inside', 'see', 'group', 'shot', 'several', 'thousand', 'fans', 'central', 'park.its', 'really', 'great', 'cover.now', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'rain', 'shortened', 'concert', 'nice', 'opening', 'scene', 'beginning', 'new', 'York', 'central', 'park', 'busy', 'streets', 'NYC', ""'re"", 'brought', 'teens', 'doing', 'sort', 'African', 'dance', 'miss', 'Diana', 'Ross.the', 'shortened', 'version', 'entire', 'shortened', 'concert', 'full', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'asking', 'fans', 'please', 'leave', 'slowly', 'safely', 'point', 'rain', 'coming', 'down', 'buckets', 'so', 'much', 'rain', 'seen', 'falling', 'amazing', 'lasted', 'full', 'version', 'concert', 'where', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'first', '15min', 'pretty', 'much', 'original', 'previous', 'night', 'news', 'commentators', 'nite', 'talking', 'people', 'who', 'went', 'storm', 'coming', 'how', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'promised', 'be', 'back', 'next', 'night', 'newspaper', 'clippings', 'actual', 'evening', 'news', 'are', 'shown', 'recap', 'where', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'running', 'out', 'trailer', 'stage', 'cameraman', 'her.i', 'would', 'totally', 'recommend', 'buying', 'DVD', 'part', 'NYC', 'history', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'tape', 'was', 'kept', 'great', 'condition', 'transfer', 'used', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'was', 'remastered', 'was', 'digital', 'format', 'great', 'years', 'please', 'pick', 'up.Diana', 'Ross', 'Live', 'Central', 'Park']",N/A

As a small kid I recall watching her on TV for the first time when I saw ""Mahogany"" and loved her acting, her voice and most of all her presence. Years went by and I only grew to love Diana even more as 1980 was a banner year for Diana with ""I'm Coming Out"" and ""Upside Down"" topping the charts worldwide.On July 20th, 1983 the small coal-mining town I was living in (and still reside) finally got cable television meaning no longer were we only able to view two channels, but 20! On a small Alberta independent TV station the next day I watched Diana Ross live in New York's Central Park. This was the first time I had ever seen her perform and was not disappointed.As most know the concert was dealt a severe rain storm and that image of Diana being pelted by the rain and breeze while belting out song after song (especially her ""Endless Love"") will remain vivid in my memory forever. The concert was cancelled, but not before Diana told the crowd she would return the next day and perform again. She kept her word.Now finally after 29 years this concert (one of the best in my opinion) is out on DVD for people to enjoy for years of posterity.I have watched this concert multiple times and I never tire of it and you won't either as you watch a professional show what it is to be a singer, but more than that, a superstar of the highest order.",5,"""TOTALLY AMAZING!!!""",1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,1513,"['have', 'never', 'been', 'discreet', 'when', 'telling', 'people', 'who', 'idols', 'are', 'always', 'mention', 'Doana', 'Ross', 'one', 'five', 'most', 'influential', 'people', 'entire', 'life', 'small', 'kid', 'recall', 'watching', 'TV', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'saw', 'Mahogany', 'loved', 'acting', 'voice', 'most', 'presence', 'Years', 'went', 'only', 'grew', 'love', 'Diana', 'even', 'more', '1980', 'was', 'banner', 'year', 'Diana', ""'m"", 'Coming', 'Out', 'Upside', 'Down', 'topping', 'charts', 'worldwide.On', 'July', '20th', '1983', 'small', 'coal-mining', 'town', 'was', 'living', 'still', 'reside', 'finally', 'got', 'cable', 'television', 'meaning', 'no', 'longer', 'were', 'only', 'able', 'view', 'two', 'channels', '20', 'small', 'Alberta', 'independent', 'TV', 'station', 'next', 'day', 'watched', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'live', 'New', 'York', 'Central', 'Park', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'perform', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.As', 'most', 'know', 'concert', 'was', 'dealt', 'severe', 'rain', 'storm', 'image', 'Diana', 'being', 'pelted', 'rain', 'breeze', 'belting', 'out', 'song', 'song', 'especially', 'Endless', 'Love', 'will', 'remain', 'vivid', 'memory', 'forever', 'concert', 'was', 'cancelled', 'not', 'Diana', 'told', 'crowd', 'would', 'return', 'next', 'day', 'perform', 'again', 'kept', 'word.Now', 'finally', '29', 'years', 'concert', 'one', 'best', 'opinion', 'out', 'DVD', 'people', 'enjoy', 'years', 'posterity.I', 'have', 'watched', 'concert', 'multiple', 'times', 'never', 'tire', 'wo', ""n't"", 'either', 'watch', 'professional', 'show', 'what', 'be', 'singer', 'more', 'superstar', 'highest', 'order']",N/A

Shortly after she began, a huge thunderstorm rolled in and drenched the crowd, but that did not stop Miss Ross. Through the high winds and heavy rains and lightning, she just kept on singing, and refused to go anywhere, as she told her fans. And as she gave it her all and sang her heart out, the rain got even heavier. Unfortunately, she finally had to cut the concert short, but not before promising that she would be back the next day to do it all over again. And she did--under clear blue skies and an even rowdier Friday night crowd. (I heard that there were a lot of arrests due to purse snatching and fights after the second performance)I wasn't born until 6 years later in June 1989, but I am a big fan of Diana's music, and I highly enjoy ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"" ""Reflections,"" ""Pieces of Ice,"" ""Let's go up"" and ""Endless Love"" (which was my parents' wedding song.) I would have definitely watched this had I been my current age, in 1983. And if I lived walking distance from Central Park I would've tried to go to this concert. I had no idea that she even did this until recently and so I had to buy a copy of it to watch it. I am amazed at the clear picture quality of the DVD (there are parts near the end which are blurry for some reason) after seeing low quality clips of it on Youtube. The commentary is great too, which gives great behind the scenes insight. I like the Day 2 recap with clips of various news stories about the concert from later that night, and sound bytes of the weatherman predicting severe thunderstorms for that evening when the show began, and other announcements from various radio programs, and what Miss Ross had to say when she was interviewed on the local news the next morning. I also enjoy the opening of the show, which has an African tribal themed dance, and stills of Diana hiding in the tall grass like she's stalking her prey, intertwined with shots of the busy NYC streets.Only gripe is Pieces of Ice being cut from the dvd for licensing issues, but I found a good quality clip of it on Youtube and downloaded it.Just goes to show you that she is a true diva, superstar and legendary performer, not letting any rain or wind (or winter storm) make her suddenly stop her show.",5,"Amazing, literally electrifying performance from the queen of Motown",1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,2433,"['steamy', 'hot', 'summer', 'evening', 'NYC', 'July', '1983', 'thousands', 'die', 'hard', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'fans', 'crammed', 'Central', 'Park', 'much', 'anticipated', 'free', 'concert', 'being', 'broadcast', 'live', 'world', 'Shortly', 'began', 'huge', 'thunderstorm', 'rolled', 'drenched', 'crowd', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'Miss', 'Ross', 'high', 'winds', 'heavy', 'rains', 'lightning', 'just', 'kept', 'singing', 'refused', 'go', 'anywhere', 'told', 'fans', 'gave', 'sang', 'heart', 'rain', 'got', 'even', 'heavier', 'Unfortunately', 'finally', 'had', 'cut', 'concert', 'short', 'not', 'promising', 'would', 'be', 'back', 'next', 'day', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'did', 'clear', 'blue', 'skies', 'even', 'rowdier', 'Friday', 'night', 'crowd', 'heard', 'were', 'lot', 'arrests', 'due', 'purse', 'snatching', 'fights', 'second', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'born', '6', 'years', 'later', 'June', '1989', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Diana', 'music', 'highly', 'enjoy', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'No', 'Mountain', 'High', 'Enough', 'Reflections', 'Pieces', 'Ice', 'Let', 'go', 'up', 'Endless', 'Love', 'was', 'parents', 'wedding', 'song', 'would', 'have', 'definitely', 'watched', 'had', 'been', 'current', 'age', '1983', 'lived', 'walking', 'distance', 'Central', 'Park', 'would', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'go', 'concert', 'had', 'idea', 'even', 'did', 'recently', 'so', 'had', 'buy', 'copy', 'watch', 'am', 'amazed', 'clear', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'are', 'parts', 'end', 'are', 'blurry', 'reason', 'seeing', 'low', 'quality', 'clips', 'Youtube', 'commentary', 'great', 'too', 'great', 'scenes', 'insight', 'like', 'Day', '2', 'recap', 'clips', 'various', 'news', 'stories', 'concert', 'later', 'night', 'sound', 'bytes', 'weatherman', 'predicting', 'severe', 'thunderstorms', 'evening', 'when', 'show', 'began', 'other', 'announcements', 'various', 'radio', 'programs', 'what', 'Miss', 'Ross', 'had', 'say', 'when', 'was', 'interviewed', 'local', 'news', 'next', 'morning', 'also', 'enjoy', 'opening', 'show', 'African', 'tribal', 'themed', 'dance', 'stills', 'Diana', 'hiding', 'tall', 'grass', 'stalking', 'prey', 'intertwined', 'shots', 'busy', 'NYC', 'streets.Only', 'gripe', 'Pieces', 'Ice', 'being', 'cut', 'dvd', 'licensing', 'issues', 'found', 'good', 'quality', 'clip', 'Youtube', 'downloaded', 'it.Just', 'show', 'true', 'diva', 'superstar', 'legendary', 'performer', 'not', 'letting', 'rain', 'wind', 'winter', 'storm', 'make', 'suddenly', 'stop', 'show']",N/A
