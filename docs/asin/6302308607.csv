306794,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302308607,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","Livin' Large, 1991 filmThis is a drama-comedy about the media and its effects on society. A leader in the ""Boy Guides"" is photographed coming out of an X-rated bookstore. He allows an interview which results in damage to his personal life. The result is another hostage situation and a shooting. A passer-by picks up the microphone and camera to interview the shooter, and gets 15 minutes of fame for Dexter Jackson and a chance to leave his job in a tailor shop for a television show. He does the news to expose the time it takes to answer a 911 call in various neighborhoods in Atlanta Georgia (one of the highest murder rates in the country). [Does your favorite TV news show offer similar exploitative news programs?] The audience wants sensations: crime, sex, and violence. ""If it bleeds, it leads.""An interview at a barbershop reveals its hidden side on the air. The interviewed person runs away, a perfect ending to a story! Their ratings escalate, the reporter is the star. Will success spoil him? Does he exploit his subjects? Dexter gets a new car (but it is leased). Is marriage a good career move? Kate asks Mary about moving up. Dexter moves to a more expensive high-rise apartment now. He visits a small restaurant to expose their cooking secrets. [Do you know what they do in your favorite restaurant?] Mary makes her moves (a hidden agenda?). [Note the screens on his girlfriend's windows.] Missy interviews a pair of Siamese twins. Unbelievable! Has Dexter changed? A tip leads to a crime in progress, which has consequences for a friend. There is more news about a shooting at a drugstore. There is an explosive climax! They plan for co-anchors next (for better ratings).Ever wonder why there are changes in news shows personnel? ""Its for the ratings."" Who is changing? Dexter meets his wife's parents for the first time. ""Its Showtime."" Friends and relatives of the groom attend the wedding. [Are they all actors?] ""Are you ok?"" ""Roll the commercial."" Somebody doesn't follow the script. Who will get the blame? Dexter explains how ""hype"" replaced real news on TV. [These scenes are like the ""Jerry"" show.] Dexter gets back to his true love for a happy ending. There is a surprise ending.The legend of Faust told of a man who sold his sold his soul to the devil then came to regret it. But that can never happen in the real world, can it? How often do the people on a news show get replaced? Do they all seem like clones of each other?",3,A Comedy About Society,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,2454,"['Livin', 'Large', '1991', 'filmThis', 'drama-comedy', 'media', 'effects', 'society', 'leader', 'Boy', 'Guides', 'photographed', 'coming', 'X-rated', 'bookstore', 'interview', 'results', 'damage', 'personal', 'life', 'result', 'hostage', 'situation', 'shooting', 'passer-by', 'up', 'microphone', 'camera', 'interview', 'shooter', '15', 'minutes', 'fame', 'Dexter', 'Jackson', 'chance', 'leave', 'job', 'tailor', 'shop', 'television', 'show', 'news', 'expose', 'time', 'answer', '911', 'call', 'various', 'neighborhoods', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia', 'one', 'highest', 'murder', 'rates', 'country', '[', 'favorite', 'TV', 'news', 'show', 'offer', 'similar', 'exploitative', 'news', 'programs', ']', 'audience', 'sensations', 'crime', 'sex', 'violence', 'interview', 'barbershop', 'hidden', 'side', 'air', 'interviewed', 'person', 'away', 'perfect', 'ending', 'story', 'ratings', 'escalate', 'reporter', 'star', 'Will', 'success', 'spoil', 'exploit', 'subjects', 'Dexter', 'new', 'car', 'leased', 'marriage', 'good', 'career', 'move', 'Kate', 'Mary', 'moving', 'up', 'Dexter', 'more', 'expensive', 'high-rise', 'apartment', 'now', 'small', 'restaurant', 'expose', 'cooking', 'secrets', '[', 'Do', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'favorite', 'restaurant', ']', 'Mary', 'moves', 'hidden', 'agenda', '[', 'Note', 'screens', 'girlfriend', 'windows', ']', 'Missy', 'pair', 'Siamese', 'twins', 'Unbelievable', 'Has', 'Dexter', 'changed', 'tip', 'crime', 'progress', 'consequences', 'friend', 'more', 'news', 'shooting', 'drugstore', 'explosive', 'climax', 'plan', 'co-anchors', 'next', 'better', 'ratings', '.Ever', 'wonder', 'why', 'are', 'changes', 'news', 'shows', 'personnel', 'ratings', 'Who', 'changing', 'Dexter', 'wife', 'parents', 'first', 'time', 'Showtime', 'Friends', 'relatives', 'groom', 'attend', 'wedding', '[', 'Are', 'actors', 'Are', 'ok', 'Roll', 'commercial', 'Somebody', ""n't"", 'follow', 'script', 'Who', 'will', 'get', 'blame', 'Dexter', 'how', 'hype', 'replaced', 'real', 'news', 'TV', 'scenes', 'are', 'Jerry', 'show', ']', 'Dexter', 'back', 'true', 'love', 'happy', 'ending', 'surprise', 'ending.The', 'legend', 'Faust', 'told', 'man', 'who', 'sold', 'sold', 'soul', 'devil', 'then', 'came', 'regret', 'can', 'never', 'happen', 'real', 'world', 'can', 'How', 'often', 'do', 'people', 'news', 'show', 'get', 'replaced', 'Do', 'seem', 'clones', 'other']",Livin Large VHS

306796,A2F8ZRSX7MDOCT,6302308607,"Brandon Wiggins ""Glass Onion Child""","[1, 5]","Obviously, this movie was made in the early 90s and so I guess you have to allow for a little more understanding regarding the overly racial characatures. This would have been a decent comedy, but there is a definite effort to insert a 'message'. However, this movie's message was nothing more than a blurry ambiquity that made no real sense.This movie tells the story of a black guy from the hood, Dexter Jackson, who gets into the news business and is manipulated by white people. The farther he gets into the business, the 'whiter' he becomes. (there is even a recurring nightmare of an extremely creepy white Dexter Jackson) Basically, white people in the movie were super articulate and completely ignorant to black culture in general (dude), while black people were all from the hood with an urban dialect and no clue (homeboy).Becoming 'white' is portrayed as an absolute state of being that is bred by success and is ultimately bad in contrast to the black person Dexter was. In the end, this movie had good intentions (i think), but did nothing in the way of removing any racial barriers or helping lack of understanding. The plot is absurd and the characters are absolutely ridiculous because of their rapidly morphing personalities and two dimensional nature.I admit, the beginning of the movie was entertaining and funny (then again, it was 3am and I was kinda bored). But by the end, I was laughing at the absolute crap it had turned into.",1,Not sure what the point of this movie was....,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,1452,"['Obviously', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'early', '90s', 'so', 'guess', 'have', 'allow', 'little', 'more', 'understanding', 'regarding', 'overly', 'racial', 'characatures', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'comedy', 'definite', 'effort', 'insert', ""'message"", 'However', 'movie', 'message', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'blurry', 'ambiquity', 'made', 'real', 'sense.This', 'movie', 'story', 'black', 'guy', 'hood', 'Dexter', 'Jackson', 'who', 'news', 'business', 'manipulated', 'white', 'people', 'farther', 'business', ""'whiter"", 'even', 'recurring', 'nightmare', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'white', 'Dexter', 'Jackson', 'Basically', 'white', 'people', 'movie', 'were', 'super', 'articulate', 'completely', 'ignorant', 'black', 'culture', 'general', 'dude', 'black', 'people', 'were', 'hood', 'urban', 'dialect', 'clue', 'homeboy', '.Becoming', ""'white"", 'portrayed', 'absolute', 'state', 'being', 'bred', 'success', 'ultimately', 'bad', 'contrast', 'black', 'person', 'Dexter', 'was', 'end', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'intentions', 'i', 'think', 'did', 'nothing', 'way', 'removing', 'racial', 'barriers', 'helping', 'lack', 'understanding', 'plot', 'absurd', 'characters', 'are', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'rapidly', 'morphing', 'personalities', 'two', 'dimensional', 'nature.I', 'admit', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'then', 'again', 'was', '3am', 'was', 'kinda', 'bored', 'end', 'was', 'laughing', 'absolute', 'crap', 'had', 'turned']",Livin Large VHS
306797,A1QV10EMDQALXS,6302308607,Darryl Wren,"[1, 1]","Livin' Large is an old cool fun movie with a good message...'stay true to yourself and no matter where life takes you never forget where you came from and the people who helped and supported you along the way'!  That being said; my man T.C. Carson (who's from 'The Chi' where I'm from...otherwise known as Chicago) pre 'Living Single', the always lovely Lisa Arrindell and Nathaniel Hall (who narrates the movie) give 'knock out' performances (as &#34;Dexter&#34;, &#34;Toynelle&#34; and &#34;Baker&#34; respectively...) which makes the movie both relatable and believable.  &#34;Dexter's&#34; relationship with &#34;Kate&#34; (Blanche Baker) the 'all about the ratings' producer while acrimonious does offer some moments of funny and real clarity (&#34;Dexter's&#34; pronunciation of the word 'ask' as 'axe' and &#34;Kate&#34; picking up an 'axe' from the wall and semi threatening him with it saying &#34;this is an axe&#34;) is one of the funnier moments in the film.  Also, &#34;Dexter's&#34; relationship with &#34;Clifford Worthy&#34; (Bernie McInerney) who takes a liking to &#34;Dexter&#34; and offers him 'words of wisdom' throughout the film is poignant.  The end of the movie is predictable but a lot of fun!  Trust me...there are worse things you can do for 90 minutes...watching this movie isn't one of them.

I ignored it in the 90's because I assumed it wasn't anything worth watching, but recently caught it on cable because nothing else was on. Hey I was bored, maybe that's a reason I got into it, but all and all it's okay. It won't have you rolling over laughing, but it is kind of funny. This is not a film I'd recommend you spend any money on but it's a good film to take in if you got nothing better to do. The end is the funniest part. Dexter has to marry the weatherlady, Missy and the entire wedding is supposed to go on air. These scenes are hilarious!  Unfortunately it takes too long for the movie to get to this part and there are some very draggy parts included for it to be a comedy. I actually caught myself dozing twice.This film is very outdated now, considering that the style was strictly early 90's (and everything in this movie proves that). TC was pretty good and kept the film going. Sure, a lot of the other actors sucked but don't just rag on this movie if you haven't seen it.

Im not the least bit surprised that the negative reviews are not even reviews but written down babble from people who couldnt write a review to save their lives and always use the same kind of criticism to describe EVERY movie they hate. Stupid, predictable sheep. At any rate, Livin Large came and went for the simple fact that it was smarter than its target audience. Beyond the humor is a message to behold.Terrence T.C. Carson plays Dexter Jackson, a somewhat narcissistic brother that dreams of one day being a top anchorman for Channel 4 news. He gets his chance after the passing of a news reporter. In the process, an unscrupulous news executive named Kate(Blanche Baker) is trying to change him while he desperately tries to hold on to his identity.Livin Large is funny at times and is pretty smart in its message which is simple: dont sell your soul to be accepted by ""them"". If you're black then be black. The funniest scene would have to be the wedding scene where Dexter is forced to marry a tramp news reporter in order to be an anchorman. Livin Large will offend those that are against it's message while being praised by those that are smart enough to embrace it. Terrence Carson was pretty funny in this movie and his gorgeous  girlfriend Toynell(played by Lisa Arrindell)is fine as hell.
