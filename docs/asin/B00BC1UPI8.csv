The one negative feature of the movie (as released outside of Taiwan) is the subtitling.

1624395,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00BC1UPI8,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 5]","Throughout history, many countries have suffered from famines.  Famines have destroyed cities, led to internal collapses of civilization, diseases/plagues and has led to unrest.While one can read of great famines in Ireland, the United States, Ethiopia, India and Russia.  And for China, the country has suffered many centuries of famine, where millions upon millions have died.But during World War II, because of Japanese occupation and politics, the famine that took place in Henan, China was downplayed and even to the point of not existing, until a Time magazine journalist named Theodore H. White, who was stationed in Chungking, China's wartime capital, was able to see and document the refugees (who were affected by the famine) and yet were being killed by the Japanese during bombing raids and turned back by their own government who did not have a solution to feed millions of people, nor to have millions stay in their city.Unfortunately, the truth was censored by the Nationalist government of China at the time and even his editors rewrote his stories at Time Magazine.  So, Theodore White went on to write his account of what he saw in China along with Annalee Jacoby, in the book ""Thunder Out if China"".For filmmaker Feng Xiaogang, it has been a challenge for him to get the novel of Zhenyu Liu, based on the famine in the Henan province to be made into a film.  After several attempts, in 2010, ""Back to 1942&#8243; would eventually receive a film adaptation.Known for his films ""A World Without Thieves"", ""If You Are the One"", ""Cell Phone"", ""The Banquet"" and becoming one of China's most successful filmmakers.  ""Back to 1942&#8243; would eventually win the A.I.C. Award for ""Best cinematography"" and the ""Golden Butterfly Award"" during its premiere at the International Rome Film Festival and ""Best Film of Mainland and Taiwan"" at the 32nd Hong Kong Film Awards.VIDEO:""Back to 1942&#8243; is a film that was intentionally desaturated and given almost a greenish/brownish tinge at times.  While costume design and production design are top notch, and the cinematography by Yue Lu look wonderful, I think that the choice of colors of not being natural was a bit of a surprise.  Sometimes they were, sometimes they were cooler, sometimes they were warmer but for the most part, I assume this was Lu and filmmaker Feng Xiaogang's intention.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Back to 1942&#8243; is presented in Mandarin/English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  Mandarin being the primary language spoken, while Tim Robbins and Adrien Brody's scenes are in English.  There is good use of surround usage during the more wartime scenes.  From the Japanese attacks on the refugees to the attacks on Chinese cities, there is good use of the surround channels and LFE during those scenes.  But the film is primarily dialogue driven and sometimes allows for use of crowd ambiance.Subtitles are in English and Chinese.SPECIAL FEATURES""Back to 1942&#8243; comes with a theatrical trailer.EXTRAS:""Back to 1942&#8243; comes with a slipcover.JUDGMENT CALL:""Back to 1942&#8243; is a thought-provoking film and also a war film that many filmmakers have not even tried to pursue.In the past few years, we have seen films that dealt with Japanese occupation and the atrocities that took place, especially in Nanjing or other areas of China such as the film ""City of Life and Death"" and ""The Children of Huang-Shi"" but having taken a Chinese history class and have watched countless historical documentaries of famine that have destroyed civilizations throughout our history, ""Back to 1942&#8243; was the first film that exposed me to the famine of Henan.China is a country that has suffered from famine for centuries, while ""The Great Chinese Famine"" (1958-1961) were widely reported in the press, while journalist Theodore H. White tried his best to get the Chinese Nationalist government and his own bosses to report on the starving refugees, it was not widely reported and if anything, the government downplayed the death toll as seen in the film to around over a thousand people dying, while the truth is that 300 million may have died.  And unfortunately because it was downplayed, the exact figures were not ever recorded.Why would this happen?Journalist Theodore H. White garnered attention with what he wrote from his own personal first-person account, ""Famine and flood are China's sorrow. From time out of mind Chinese chroniclers have recorded these recurrent disasters with beating, persistent note of doom. Always in their chronicles Chinese historians have judged the great dynasties of the past by their ability to meet and master such tragic emergencies. In the concluding years of the war against Japan such a famine ravaged the north and tested the government of Chiang Kai-shek.""Also, the government continued their trend of taxing the poor farmers who planted their grain, getting a large percentage of it and left very little for them to survive on.  To make things worse, those who must meet the grain quota had to sell their animals, land and property to raise money to buy the grain from others.Chinese independent newspapers tried to get the word out of what was happening in Henan, but the government closed down the newspaper.""Back to 1942&#8243; does show some of the horrors that White had written about.  People eating bark from trees and also leaves, dead people left on the side of the trail to be eaten by dogs.You would think the government would respond, but White would write, "" The Chinese government failed to foresee the famine; when it came, it failed to act until too late. As early as October (1942), reports of the situation were arriving in Chungking. In November two government inspectors visited Honan, traveled the main motor roads, and returned to say the that the crisis was desperate and something must be done immediately. The Central Government dismissed the matter by appropriating $200,000,000 -paper money-for famine relief and sending a mandate to provincial authorities to remit taxes. The banks in Chungking loaded the bales of paper currency on trucks and sent a convoy bearing paper not food, to the stricken. It would have been hopeless to try to move heavy tonnage of grain from central China over the broken, mountainous communications to northern China and Honan. Yet just across the provincial border from Honan was the province of Shensi, whose grain stores were more than ample. A vigorous government would have ordered grain from Shensi into neighboring Honan immediately to avert disaster. But cracking down on Shensi in favor of Honan would have upset the delicate balance of power the government found so essential to its functioning. Grain might also have been moved to Honan from Hupeh, but the war commander in Hupeh (Hubei) would not permit it.""Suffice to say, as the film is an adaptation of the novel by Liu Zhenyun, who also wrote the film, the one narration at the end of how he tried to interview his grandmother, a refugee who survived the ordeal, she rather not talk about it.  The fact is that millions of them were unfortunately betrayed by their own government.  By greed, by politics, be the lack of decision-making and unfortunately, the war had a lot to do with it as well.While China has moved past their ties of Nationalism to Communism and the film does provide fodder for how a Nationalistic government betrayed their own people (and in ways, also showcases Chiang Kai Shek as a poor leader), unfortunately, the tale of ""Back to 1942&#8243; can be applied in so many countries that suffered from famine and even natural disasters.Filmmaker Feng Xiaogang is known for capturing the human emotion and spirit through disaster but also capturing intense battle sequences which are featured in this film.  This latest film was his most intense yet and possibly the first major attempt to reach out to an international audience thanks to the casting of both Tim Robbins and Adrien Brody.  While Tim Robbins' scenes were probably not even needed in the film, Adrien Brody's role as Theodore H. White is important as his article is what gained international attention.As for the Blu-ray release, the film does take an interesting visual style, especially when it comes down to color use (some may not like the saturated green/earth-tone tinge).  The film also has wonderful cinematography, costume and production design and for the most part, filmmaker Feng Xiaogang was able to create a thought-provoking, important film about the famine and the betrayal and the suffering of the Chinese refugees.  The lossless audio also utilizes the surround channels when needed but dialogue is crystal clear.  It is unfortunate that for a powerful film such as ""Back to 1942&#8243;, not one special feature (but a theatrical trailer) was included on the Blu-ray release.  I'm absolutely surprised by that and it is a bit disappointing.Overall, ""Back to 1942&#8243; is a powerful, thought-provoking film that opens your eyes to many factors of how millions of people in Henan, China suffered and possibly millions have died back in 1942 due to the great famine and also poor decision made by the government.  This is a film that showcases emotional suffering, death and enormous tragedy from an unfortunate time in China's history that many people in this world may not even know about and will probably never know about as this tragedy was kept secret and not documented by the government of that time.It's a little lengthy, devoid of special features but yet, ""Back to 1942&#8243; is an epic film from filmmaker Feng Xiaogang that is recommended on Blu-ray!",4,"""Back to 1942&#8243; is a powerful, thought-provoking film!",1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,9606,"['history', 'many', 'countries', 'have',

The fact that the Japanese intensely dislike Amy Tan'sThe Joy Luck Clubbecause the scene of the war refugees suffering on the road ""makes Japan look bad"" is why ""Back to 1942"" tells the misleading story that it does.And there is a strong hint throughout that the government/governer did not offer relief to drought/famine/Japanese ""visit"" - afflicted people of Henan in order to MAKE them flee their homes so that they would not be cannon fodder nor actually DINNER for the cannibalist Japanese.  Just as with the Koreans, this movie again drives home that starving Chinese would eat their dead to seemingly mitigate the shock and horror of the Japanese eating their Chinese victims as well as forcing home-invaded Chinese family members to eat pieces of one another for the entertainment of the Japanese ""visitors.""Even if you have the time to CONVINCE the already deeply impoverished Chinese majority of what will happen if they are found in their homes by the Japanese, it is still not effective in getting them to leave their homes and take their chances of dying on the road, miles from home and starving instead of the Hellraiser alternative that is their fate if they stay in situ.  The Japanese made sure that the Chinese died as slowly and painfully as possible.  No Xingxing treaured daughter, no newborn grandson, no peaceful demise for the elderly mother.  China's leaders understand the people well and it is not a hard decision to make the most effective choice to minimize the violence done to them by the Japanese waging an everlasting regretless war.Throughout, the Japanese are depicted as being above (it all) and looking down upon the Chinese in their ZEROES.  The filmmakers resist the urge to mention that the Japanese would poison or drug the food relief offered to Chinese villagers and communicates the terror of being captured by the Japanese soldiers by having it result in EMPLOYMENT which is really about the stubborn Japanese ""investment"" in China today.

Three million people are starved to death or killed in combat in henan province china in 1942. We follow two families as they try to escape to another province. The realistic bombing scenes are very horrible as people and animals are blown to bits by the merciless Japanese. The whole movie is like one long horror that never ends, and it's a true horror. The Japanese were responsible for 30 million deaths duruing the war, and many were in China. The acting here is superb and the lead actor loses everything and everyone and that is conveyed with a incredible performance from him. Tim Robbins and Adrian brody have small roles in this one and both are excellent as you would expect.  The story does jump back to Chang kai sheck as he tries to fight the war and deal with the famine. Corruptoin only makes it worse in the HEnan province for everyone including him. I think we can never understand how bad things can really be on this planet, but the lead character does when he tells his dead wife ""in your next life don't come back here' and who could blame him. After watching this movie , one can only be thankful never to have gone through a famine. Although if the carbon levels continue to climb the people of even future America will experience mass famine and crop failure , at least they won't have to be in the middle of a World war though!.

1624408,A2K6VDHSE2NU4R,B00BC1UPI8,Nachtjager,"[34, 34]","Bought this as a recommended movie because I'm primarily a WWII and history buff.  I must say, I was stunned at how truly EPIC this movie is.  The cinematography is absolutely spectacular - some of the best work I've ever seen from a foreign film and it rivals anything I've ever seen from any movie for that matter.  Unlike most foreign movies, this one doesn't have that ""Gee, I'm watching a foreign movie"" feel to it.If you do not like reading subtitles, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE.  THIS IS A MOVIE YOU MUST READ, UNLESS YOU SPEAK CHINESE.  It is 2-1/2 hours long, so watching it and reading it at the same time is challenging at times and I did pause the disc and go back a few times just to catch everything - there are many scenes where incredible scenes are unfolding but you're busy reading the text so you can't fully appreciate what's going on.  I personally don't mind doing that, but if it bothers you, then that's something to consider.The story is just what people have said, so I'll not rehash that - it is a horrifying and tragic chapter of WWII history that has been completely glossed over and forgotten, but perhaps thanks to this remarkable film, it will get some long overdue attention.  The roles played by Adrien and Tim Robins are bit parts, so their contribution to the movie is minimal, which is also great for me, personally, because I don't particularly care for either of them.  Anybody could've played their parts and the movie would've been just as good - the Chinese characters carry this film and they are OUTSTANDING.The CG work on the aerial attack scenes is slightly sub-par compared to most modern movies and has a bit of a video game look to it, but I've seen much worse - and that is the only thing I can even halfway criticize this film for.  They had a cast of thousands for this movie, used actual locations instead of doing a ton of CG work, the explosions are real (and there are a lot of them), the wounds are gruesome and realistic to the point of being just as disturbing (if not more so) as what you see in Saving Private Ryan.I cannot recommend this movie highly enough - it is a REMARKABLE achievement in every possible respect.  The story line is incredible, and even better, it apparently is largely true because it is based on interviews with a Chinese girl who lived through the experience, which was conducted by an American reporter who was there first-hand in 1942 and witnessed it himself.  If I understand it correctly, this collaboration of their record of events was published in 1964, and that work serves as the story line for this movie - thus the name, ""Back to 1942"" - it was a return to a horrifying time in their lives for both the reporter and the woman he was interviewing.If you're a WWII history fanatic, this is an essential movie you MUST have in your collection.  They NAILED all the details of the Chinese and Japanese weapons, uniforms, vehicles, and everything else throughout the movie - incredible attention to detail.

1624409,A3KQX5YJVP1R54,B00BC1UPI8,Oliver Conant,"[0, 0]","An epic of suffering in a rural Chinese province afflicted with a multitude of disasters both natural and man-made. There are sequences of bombing and strafing runs by Japanese planes on combined civilian and military columns that for realism and immediacy easily rival any number of recent films about World War II, including Saving Private Ryan. The Nationalists and their Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek are shown alternately withholding or cynically and selectively bestowing (never enough) aid for masses of starving refugees. When Adrien Brody, who plays the American journalist Theodore White, tells Chiang that there have been reports of cannibalism among the refugees, the response is that &#34;no Chinese would ever do that.&#34; The Chinese, of course, went on to do just that during Mao's induced famines, which were on a scale that eclipsed the death toll from the drought in Henan. The multiple producer /executive producer credits suggests that the staggering scale of Back to 1942 is the beneficiary of all the new money in China. But surely it could not have been made without the go ahead and resources of her present Communist rulers. Along with showing how (Nationalist) Chinese officials at the highest levels played politics with millions of lives, the film clearly and, at moments, crudely, is appealing to small &#34;n&#34; nationalist and anti-Japanese sentiment.",4,A Party Line Epic,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,1386,"['epic', 'suffering', 'rural', 'Chinese', 'province', 'afflicted', 'multitude', 'disasters', 'natural', 'man-made', 'are', 'sequences', 'bombing', 'strafing', 'runs', 'Japanese', 'planes', 'combined', 'civilian', 'military', 'columns', 'realism', 'immediacy', 'easily', 'rival', 'number', 'recent', 'films', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'including', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Nationalists', 'Generalissimo', 'Chiang', 'Kai', 'Shek', 'are', 'shown', 'alternately', 'withholding', 'cynically', 'selectively', 'bestowing', 'never', 'enough', 'aid', 'masses', 'starving', 'refugees', 'When', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'who', 'American', 'journalist', 'Theodore', 'White', 'Chiang', 'have', 'been', 'reports', 'cannibalism', 'refugees', 'response', '34', 'Chinese', 'would', 'ever', 'do', 'that.', '34', 'Chinese', 'course', 'went', 'do', 'just', 'Mao', 'induced', 'famines', 'were', 'scale', 'eclipsed', 'death', 'toll', 'drought', 'Henan', 'multiple', 'producer', '/executive', 'producer', 'credits', 'staggering', 'scale', 'Back', '1942', 'beneficiary', 'new', 'money', 'China', 'surely', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'go', 'ahead', 'resources', 'present', 'Communist', 'rulers', 'showing', 'how', 'Nationalist', 'Chinese', 'officials', 'highest', 'levels', 'played', 'politics', 'millions', 'lives', 'film', 'clearly', 'moments', 'crudely', 'appealing', 'small', '34', '34', 'nationalist', 'anti-Japanese', 'sentiment']",N/A
