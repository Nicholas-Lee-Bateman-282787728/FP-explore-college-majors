OK this makes sense.MacLaine spontaneously enacts revenge by sleeping with the handyman whom she's known for literally 30 seconds.As if things could not get any worse the FOUR of them decide to spend Christmas together at a ski lodge. Things becomes further complicated when their 20 year old daughter unexpectedly drops in with her fianc&eacute;e. Now add Derek's father. All SEVEN of these characters sleeping under the same roof is pure hell.While a plot this wacky sounds like a comedy, it's not! Nothing funny or entertaining happens at all. The opening credit sequence is of Derek in a hot tub is not worth the 90 minutes of pure agony that follows.I have no idea who the hell thought this or any other ""open relationship"" movie would be funny but they made the right move by casting Bo Derek. I suspect many others have fallen for this trap. Do not make the same mistake!!!

Dibert ""the wessel DVD Collector and ...","[1, 2]","This picture opened in theaters on December 1 1980 starring Shirley MacLane as Karin Evans, Anthony Hopkins as Adam Evans and the young and gorgeous Bo Derek as Lindsay Rutledge. This movie was about Adam Evans who's a professor at the local college is over 40 years old and has had affairs with some of his students. Along comes Lindsay Rutledge who's one off Evans students and the one he's having an affair with now. One night at a friends house the subject of affair came between Adam, Karin and there friends. The subject didn't bother there friends but it bother Karin. So on there way home Karin asked Adam if he indeed was having an affair and he said yes. Adam and Karin have been married for some 21 years and to Karin that means something, but to Adam it really means nothing. Karin stayed home raised the children and kept his house clean and washed his clothes which in these times it hard to find a good woman that would do all those things. Adam is planning to take a trip to Montreal and Karin tells Adam she wants to go and he tells her not this time. Instead of taking Karin, Adam takes Lindsay instead. While Adam is in Montreal, Karin is home by herself when she hears noises coming from the kitchen. So she goes down to investigate and finds a strange man in her kitchen feeding birds a peanut butter sandwich. The young mans named is Pete and his there to build a book shelf for Adam Evans. When questioned by Karin, Pete pulls out a slip of paper to show Karin that work is for real. Karin said okay and tells Pete that she's going to bed and then she asks Pete if he wants to come along. When Adam comes back from Montreal and walks into his house it looks like a storm hit and that's not all he found. Does Adam go with Lindsay or is she just a fling? What else did Adam find in his house? What does Karin do to Adam if anything? I love this movie because it just goes to show you that men can be real ***holes. Adam had a great home life, a great job and a beautiful wife but that wasn't enough. He wants more and he got more and Adam got what he deserved. As far as Bo Derek, she was fantastic. The way she started the film by coming up out of that water was beautiful. The shower scene was even better and I especially liked her part in the ending. I no some people didn't give this movie very go rating, however despite there review I give this movie 10 weasel stars for Bo Derek acting and beauty.",5,Bo Derek was Fantastic,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,2427,"['picture', 'opened', 'theaters', 'December', '1', '1980', 'starring', 'Shirley', 'MacLane', 'Karin', 'Evans', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Adam', 'Evans', 'young', 'gorgeous', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'Lindsay', 'Rutledge', 'movie', 'was', 'Adam', 'Evans', 'who', 'professor', 'local', 'college', '40', 'years', 'old', 'had', 'affairs', 'students', 'Lindsay', 'Rutledge', 'who', 'one', 'off', 'Evans', 'students', 'one', 'having', 'affair', 'now', 'One', 'night', 'friends', 'house', 'subject', 'affair', 'came', 'Adam', 'Karin', 'friends', 'subject', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'there', 'friends', 'bother', 'Karin', 'So', 'way', 'home', 'Karin', 'asked', 'Adam', 'indeed', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'said', 'yes', 'Adam', 'Karin', 'have', 'been', 'married', '21', 'years', 'Karin', 'something', 'Adam', 'really', 'nothing', 'Karin', 'stayed', 'home', 'raised', 'children', 'kept', 'house', 'clean', 'washed', 'clothes', 'times', 'hard', 'find', 'good', 'woman', 'would', 'do', 'things', 'Adam', 'planning', 'take', 'trip', 'Montreal', 'Karin', 'tells', 'Adam', 'go', 'not', 'time', 'Instead', 'taking', 'Karin', 'Adam', 'Lindsay', 'instead', 'Adam', 'Montreal', 'Karin', 'home', 'when', 'noises', 'coming', 'kitchen', 'down', 'investigate', 'strange', 'man', 'kitchen', 'feeding', 'birds', 'peanut', 'butter', 'sandwich', 'young', 'mans', 'named', 'Pete', 'build', 'book', 'shelf', 'Adam', 'Evans', 'When', 'questioned', 'Karin', 'Pete', 'out', 'slip', 'paper', 'show', 'Karin', 'work', 'real', 'Karin', 'said', 'okay', 'Pete', 'going', 'bed', 'then', 'Pete', 'come', 'along', 'When', 'Adam', 'back', 'Montreal', 'walks', 'house', 'storm', 'hit', 'not', 'found', 'Does', 'Adam', 'go', 'Lindsay', 'just', 'fling', 'What', 'else', 'did', 'Adam', 'find', 'house', 'What', 'Karin', 'do', 'Adam', 'anything', 'love', 'movie', 'just', 'show', 'men', 'can', 'be', 'real', '***holes', 'Adam', 'had', 'great', 'home', 'life', 'great', 'job', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'more', 'got', 'more', 'Adam', 'got', 'what', 'deserved', 'As', 'far', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'was', 'fantastic', 'way', 'started', 'film', 'coming', 'up', 'water', 'was', 'beautiful', 'shower', 'scene', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'especially', 'liked', 'part', 'ending', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'very', 'go', 'rating', 'however', 'review', 'give', 'movie', '10', 'weasel', 'stars', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'acting', 'beauty']",A Change of Seasons

This could easily have been a tearjerker(it`s a depressing theme - ""a middleaged husband replaces wife with a 20-year-old""), but the story goes comic and Mary Beth Hurt is hilarious as Shirl and Tony`s daughter. This is the only film(with 10)-  of the mainstream character - that Bo Derek did in her early career(although as young teenagers - we loved her in the soft-porn Bolero and Ghosts can`t do it hehe.)It`s good to see how young Anthony Hopkins once was and the film is filled with great acting talent...The bathtub scene... aaaaaa how I dreamt I could be TonyHopkins with Bo... I did even dream that...  Since Bo Derek rocketed to fame in 1979-80 we haven`t had the pleasure of a runner-up...  It`s a shame she never was given a James Bond-role - but she`s still gorgeous... so who knows? Maybe they`ll come to their senses and cast her one day as a Bond-dame?",4,GREAT FUN,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,872,"['could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'tearjerker', 's', 'depressing', 'theme', 'middleaged', 'husband', 'replaces', 'wife', '20-year-old', 'story', 'comic', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Hurt', 'hilarious', 'Shirl', 'Tony', 's', 'daughter', 'only', 'film', '10', 'mainstream', 'character', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'did', 'early', 'career', 'young', 'teenagers', 'loved', 'soft-porn', 'Bolero', 'Ghosts', 'can', 't', 'do', 'hehe', 's', 'good', 'see', 'how', 'young', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'once', 'was', 'film', 'filled', 'great', 'acting', 'talent', 'bathtub', 'scene', 'how', 'dreamt', 'could', 'be', 'TonyHopkins', 'Bo', 'did', 'even', 'dream', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'rocketed', 'fame', '1979-80', 'haven', 't', 'had', 'pleasure', 'runner-up', 's', 'shame', 'never', 'was', 'given', 'James', 'Bond-role', 's', 'still', 'gorgeous', 'so', 'who', 'Maybe', 'll', 'come', 'senses', 'cast', 'one', 'day', 'Bond-dame']",A Change of Seasons
892973,A2GPEV42IO41CI,B0007WQHGC,Kona,"[10, 13]","40ish college professor Adam Evans (Anthony Hopkins) is having a fling with his 20-year old student, Lindsey (Bo Derek).  When his wife (Shirley MacLaine) finds out, she doesn't get mad, she gets even, by starting an affair with a carpenter half her age.  Rather than being shocked at this, Adam takes it in stride and suggests the two couples spend a ski vacation together.With this cast, I expected so much better, but the ridiculous script spoils everything.  It tries way too hard to be hip and with-it and ever-so-nonchalant about the extra-marital affairs, with non-stop banter that consists entirely of sarcastic one-liners.  There are no pauses, just rapid-fire zingers fired off by poker-faced actors who never become real.  Even with Bo Derek's topless hot tub romp, there is nothing even remotely sexy or romantic here; indeed, the word ""love"" is never mentioned.  Hopkins' wonderful voice and subtle facial expressions are wasted, as there are no close-ups of him (or anyone else) and no time to search their faces for anything resembling jealousy, pain, rage, or even pleasure (emotions that are all lacking in the script).  I did like MacLaine's understated performance and Bo is breathtakingly beautiful (this movie was made just as ""10"" came out), but it all comes to nothing.  And the theme song that runs throughout the film, ""Where Do I Catch the Bus for Tomorrow?"" is so hopelessly corny and dated that it's just laughable.This movie is a curious and disappointing footnote in the careers of Hopkins and MacLaine.Kona",2,Winter blahs,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,1537,"['40ish', 'college', 'professor', 'Adam', 'Evans', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'having', 'fling', '20-year', 'old', 'student', 'Lindsey', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'When', 'wife', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'out', ""n't"", 'get', 'mad', 'even', 'starting', 'affair', 'carpenter', 'half', 'age', 'Rather', 'being', 'shocked', 'Adam', 'stride', 'two', 'couples', 'spend', 'ski', 'vacation', 'together.With', 'cast', 'expected', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'ridiculous', 'script', 'spoils', 'everything', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'hip', 'with-it', 'ever-so-nonchalant', 'extra-marital', 'affairs', 'non-stop', 'banter', 'entirely', 'sarcastic', 'one-liners', 'are', 'pauses', 'just', 'rapid-fire', 'zingers', 'fired', 'off', 'poker-faced', 'actors', 'who', 'never', 'become', 'real', 'Even', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'topless', 'hot', 'tub', 'romp', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'sexy', 'romantic', 'here', 'indeed', 'word', 'love', 'never', 'mentioned', 'Hopkins', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'subtle', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'wasted', 'are', 'close-ups', 'anyone', 'else', 'time', 'search', 'anything', 'resembling', 'jealousy', 'pain', 'rage', 'even', 'pleasure', 'emotions', 'are', 'lacking', 'script', 'did', 'MacLaine', 'understated', 'performance', 'Bo', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'just', '10', 'came', 'out', 'nothing', 'theme', 'song', 'film', 'Where', 'Do', 'Catch', 'Bus', 'Tomorrow', 'so', 'hopelessly', 'corny', 'dated', 'just', 'laughable.This', 'movie', 'curious', 'disappointing', 'footnote', 'careers', 'Hopkins', 'MacLaine.Kona']",A Change of Seasons
