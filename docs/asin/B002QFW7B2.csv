1284021,ADEVBXUS0RSIR,B002QFW7B2,"Alain B. Burrese ""Author, Speaker, Mediator, ...","[1, 2]","Wudang Kung Fu: Fundamental Training with Zhou, Xuan-yun is an introductory program for warm-ups, basic stances, punches, and kicks from this art from Wudang Mountain.  Zhou is a Daoist monk and Wudang Kung Fu is an art that the monks of Wudang Mountain developed by blending Daoist concepts with traditional Chinese fighting arts, integrating physical and spiritual practices in this internal-style of Wudang Kung Fu.The DVD is well produced, as I've come to expect from YMAA.  The menus are easy to navigate.  From the main menu, you can play all in English or Chinese or go to chapters.  Zhou instructs in Chinese, and if you watch the English version there is an English translation voice over.  Both tracts have the English translation in subtitles across the bottom. The chapters are broken down like this:  About Xuan Yun, Introduction, The Meaning of Internal Arts, Warm Up, Stances, Striking Drills, Kicks, Sequence - Slow, Sequence - Fast, Martial Applications, and Conclusion.The footage of Zhou in the short section about him at the beginning demonstrates that he is an extremely accomplished martial artist, and seeing him perform in the scenic settings was a good way to start the program.  I also enjoyed the beautiful scenes as the history of Wudang was explained with a voice over in the introduction.The section on the meaning of internal arts is short and provides a simple explanation and then the program goes into the warm up.  The warm up section begins by showing Zhou doing a couple of warm up exercises and encourages the viewer to warm up before training.  Due to time, it does not instruct on a complete warm up, but illustrates squats, various pushups, leg stretches, splits, waist turning, and wrist stretches.  Most martial artists will be familiar with these.  If not, you may want to consult other resources for more detailed instruction on stretching and warming up.  These first four sections of the DVD take 21 minutes.Zhou instructs that stance training is beneficial in itself to establish your roots, and as a type of stretching.  Side and Straight Horse Stances, Bow Stance, Crouching Stance, Empty Stance, and Side Stance are the stances illustrated.Zhou teaches the striking drills by themselves before incorporating them into longer forms.  Horse Stance Punchs, Side Horse Stance Punches, Bow Stance Punches, and Elbow Strikes are performed.In the Kicks section, a brief history of Wudang kicking is explained while Zhou is shown demonstrating various kicks.  Zhou opens with saying he won't teach all the kicking combinations, but will show 24 basic kicks.  There is not a lot of detail in the instruction, just the basics of each of the 24 kicks and then Zhou demonstrates.  He demonstrates applications with a partner holding pads for most of the kicks.  I do caution anyone regarding the use of crescent type kicks, or any kicks for that matter, to kick a weapon, especially a knife, from someone's hand.  I know many martial arts teach this, but to actually do so is a different story.  I wish Zhou wouldn't have mentioned this.  Zhou does give tips along the way, but again, there is not a lot of detail in the instruction.  A novice will need more instruction on kicking, especially for some of the jumping and turning kicks included here, but for an overview of the kicks in the system this DVD is very good.The forms (Sequence) section starts with some general comments about forms while Zhou performs outside.  Then the DVD moves back inside and Zhou illustrates the first form.  It's also shown outside too.  Even though this first form is the simplest form taught at Wudang Mountain, it's a fairly long and complicate form compared to some of the simple beginning forms of some arts.  It is a very beautiful form to watch as Zhou performs, especially outside.After the demonstrations of the form, Zhou breaks down and demonstrates the various moves from the form and applications of the moves.  I really liked this, because I think having an application to a move helps learn forms.  There is also a written insert in the DVD that contains the 24 postures/moves of the basic form in English and Chinese.Zhou concludes by thanking his assistants and shares a couple of words regarding training and then the final scene shows him playing a Chinese flute.  The entire program was 97 minutes long.  The DVD also contains the standard YMAA extras with catalog and video previews.I thought this was an excellent introduction and overview of the basics of Wudang Kung Fu.  To learn the style, a person will need more than this video, but that can be said of any martial art.  For the person who is studying this style, this will complement their instruction nicely.  If you are studying a similar style, this will also be very complementary.  For those that are just interested in various styles, this is a great overview.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of the DVD set Hapkido Cane.",4,Excellent introduction and overview of the basics

In this video, he effortlessly bounces, jumps, kicks and glides through movement after movement. He quickly moves from warm-ups to basic and then advanced movements. It was a good workout to keep up: this style of kung fu is not for the elderly or overweight. If you have heart problems, are not physically active, or are pregnant, I would not advise trying to actually duplicate what is shown in this video.Unlike some instructional videos I've seen, each movement is explained, and demonstrated at slow and full speed. It gives the viewer a good basis upon which to judge their own performance. Some of the movements simply cannot be performed by the average person, or even the average martial artist, which is a weak point in the video, as suggestions and guidance on improving to the point one could accomplish these things is simply not there.Others have also commented on Zhou's enthusiasm (or lack thereof) during the warm-up portion. To this I can only reply that the instructor isn't a polished Hollywood type with the gift for gab and a fake smile. To do and perform is where the instructor finds his love of what he does, and it shows. His demonstrations of techniques and forms are powerful and graceful examples of the full promise of Martial Arts.The instructor's command of the English language is impressive, considering his background. I hope that as he does more of these, he becomes more comfortable in front of a camera. It seemed quite frequently that he did not know what to do with his hands, always appearing to try to be doing something other than giving his full attention to the camera when he was speaking. This problem went away the moment he went into demonstration mode.I would recommend this video to anyone who leads an active lifestyle, and is under the age of 45. I really hate to use definite age limits on these, so please view this as a reasonable suggestive range of the material presented.(On a complete aside, and not a knock on the production of this video in particular, but I personally would like to see the full potential of DVDs realized in martial arts instruction. Let the viewer decide if they want to see previews of other videos, don't lock them into it. Let the viewer decide if and when they want to view/read a biographical account of the instructor. How about photos of each movement, provided in a manner in which the viewer can move from one still to the next, and broken down into segments of stances, punches, kicks, holds/grabs, throws, and miscellany? It just seems like Martial Arts instructional DVDs stick to the ABCs, and leave the production value at face-value. I expect more from a DVD. VHS is gone, so quite stuffing VHS videos onto a DVD and calling it good. It seems like an industry-wide epidemic.)",4,A Master in his Glory,1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,2873,"['Xuan-Yun', 'Zhou', 'impressive', 'athlete', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'formidable', 'martial', 'artist', 'video', 'effortlessly', 'jumps', 'kicks', 'glides', 'movement', 'movement', 'quickly', 'warm-ups', 'basic', 'then', 'advanced', 'movements', 'was', 'good', 'workout', 'keep', 'up', 'style', 'kung', 'fu', 'not', 'elderly', 'overweight', 'have', 'heart', 'problems', 'are', 'not', 'physically', 'active', 'are', 'pregnant', 'would', 'not', 'advise', 'trying', 'actually', 'duplicate', 'what', 'shown', 'video.Unlike', 'instructional', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movement', 'explained', 'demonstrated', 'slow', 'full', 'speed', 'viewer', 'good', 'basis', 'judge', 'own', 'performance', 'movements', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'performed', 'average', 'person', 'even', 'average', 'martial', 'artist', 'weak', 'point', 'video', 'suggestions', 'guidance', 'improving', 'point', 'one', 'could', 'accomplish', 'things', 'simply', 'not', 'there.Others', 'have', 'also', 'commented', 'Zhou', 'enthusiasm', 'lack', 'thereof', 'warm-up', 'portion', 'can', 'only', 'reply', 'instructor', ""n't"", 'polished', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'gift', 'gab', 'fake', 'smile', 'do', 'perform', 'where', 'instructor', 'love', 'what', 'demonstrations', 'techniques', 'forms', 'are', 'powerful', 'graceful', 'examples', 'full', 'promise', 'Martial', 'Arts.The', 'instructor', 'command', 'English', 'language', 'impressive', 'considering', 'background', 'hope', 'more', 'more', 'comfortable', 'front', 'camera', 'seemed', 'quite', 'frequently', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'hands', 'always', 'appearing', 'try', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'other', 'giving', 'full', 'attention', 'camera', 'when', 'was', 'speaking', 'problem', 'went', 'away', 'moment', 'went', 'demonstration', 'mode.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'video', 'anyone', 'who', 'active', 'lifestyle', 'age', '45', 'really', 'hate', 'use', 'definite', 'age', 'limits', 'so', 'please', 'view', 'reasonable', 'suggestive', 'range', 'material', 'presented', 'complete', 'aside', 'not', 'knock', 'production', 'video', 'particular', 'personally', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'full', 'potential', 'DVDs', 'realized', 'martial', 'arts', 'instruction', 'Let', 'viewer', 'decide', 'want', 'see', 'previews', 'other', 'videos', 'do', ""n't"", 'lock', 'Let', 'viewer', 'decide', 'when', 'want', 'view/read', 'biographical', 'account', 'instructor', 'How', 'photos', 'movement', 'provided', 'manner', 'viewer', 'can', 'move', 'one', 'still', 'next', 'broken', 'down', 'segments', 'stances', 'punches', 'kicks', 'holds/grabs', 'throws', 'miscellany', 'just', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'instructional', 'DVDs', 'stick', 'ABCs', 'leave', 'production', 'value', 'face-value', 'expect', 'more', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'gone', 'quite', 'stuffing', 'VHS', 'videos', 'DVD', 'calling', 'good', 'industry-wide', 'epidemic']",N/A

The program is clearly presented and expertly demonstrated by Master Zhou, Zuan-Yun, a Taoist monk who trained and later taught martial arts and qigong on Wudang Mountain.The program begins with a brief biography of Master Zhou, an introduction describing Wudang Mountain and an informative overview of internal martial arts (Wudang kung fu is considered an internal or soft style martial art.) The introductory sections are beautifully filmed and presented, and although brief, they are inspiring and compliment the training that follows.The training portion of the DVD begins with warm up exercises and movements. Beginners take note: Master Zhou warns that neglecting to warm up the body properly and sufficiently at the beginning of each training session could lead to injury. Master Zhou encourages students to take their time to warm up sufficiently and - for those who aren't flexible - gradually work towards the movements demonstrated.In the next three sections, Master Zhou explains and demonstrates the basic stances, strikes, and kicks that are the foundation of the fundamental training. Beginners considering this DVD should be aware that diligently practicing these basic skills is essential to learning and progressing with this program. Since all of these stances, strikes and kicks will be encountered in the Wudang forms, it's important to continuously drill and practice these skills in order to build the strength, accuracy, speed, coordination and force required to execute forms properly.Next, Master Zhou demonstrates and explains Ji Ben Tao Lu, the first form taught to students on Wudang Mountain. According to Master Zhou, the first form is designed primarily to help students develop an underlying awareness of their body and learn how to exert force through strikes.Ji Ben Tao Lu is demonstrated several times at slow and fast speeds, and is broken down into individual movements during the martial applications section. The inclusion of the martial applications section helps to clarify the form and will be especially helpful to beginners who may otherwise find the form difficult to learn.Wudang Kung Fu--Fundamental Training, is a well produced and expertly demonstrated program featuring a fascinating, Taoist based, internal martial art that, until recently, has not been readily available in the United States.

Hence the name of this particular style of Kung Fu, which gained widespread notoriety with the release of the martial arts film,Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It also gives you a brief yet informative overview of Wudang Kung Fu, which is an internal martial art similar to Aikido or Tai Chi.After the brief introduction, the next chapter begins with basic warm up exercises and body movements. And although this section, like the rest of the video, was very well presented and professionally done, I have to question the actual stretching demonstration performed by Master Zhou. I felt that he didn't explain it very well, especially when it came to the ballistic stretching that he was demonstrating. This is rarely, if every, a good way to stretch and especially for beginners this can be very detrimental not only to their training, but also their long term health and longevity. Although Master Zhou does warn the viewer about the dangers of not warming up and stretching the body properly before training.The training portion of the DVD begins with warm up exercises and movements. Beginners take note: Master Zhou warns that neglecting to warm up the body properly and sufficiently at the beginning of each training session could lead to injury. Master Zhou encourages students to take their time to warm up sufficiently and, for those who aren't flexible, gradually work towards the movements demonstrated.In the next three chapters, Master Zhou explains and demonstrates the basic stances, strikes, and kicks that are found in Wudang Kung Fu, all of which are also seen in many other martial arts styles. The video ends with a very well done demonstration of the very first form taught in this style. This form is demonstrated several times at various speeds and angles and is broken down into individual movements and their applications.I have to admit that I was a bit confused after watching this video as this style of Kng Fu is purported to be of a soft style, yet it seemed more like a hard style than anything. But maybe that was just me.Shawn KovacichCreator of numerous books and DVD's.",5,Great Basic Introduction to This Internal Martial Art,1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,2262,"['DVD', 'short', 'biography', 'Master', 'Xuan-Yun', 'Zhou', 'who', 'Taoist', 'monk', 'who', 'trained', 'later', 'taught', 'martial', 'arts', 'qigong', 'Wudang', 'Mountain', 'Hence', 'name', 'particular', 'style', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'gained', 'widespread', 'notoriety', 'release', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'also', 'brief', 'yet', 'informative', 'overview', 'Wudang', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'internal', 'martial', 'art', 'similar', 'Aikido', 'Tai', 'Chi.After', 'brief', 'introduction', 'next', 'chapter', 'basic', 'warm', 'up', 'exercises', 'body', 'movements', 'section', 'rest', 'video', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'professionally', 'done', 'have', 'question', 'actual', 'stretching', 'demonstration', 'performed', 'Master', 'Zhou', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'explain', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'when', 'came', 'ballistic', 'stretching', 'was', 'demonstrating', 'rarely', 'good', 'way', 'stretch', 'especially', 'beginners', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'detrimental', 'not', 'only', 'training', 'also', 'long', 'term', 'health', 'longevity', 'Master', 'Zhou', 'warn', 'viewer', 'dangers', 'not', 'warming', 'up', 'stretching', 'body', 'properly', 'training.The', 'training', 'portion', 'DVD', 'warm', 'up', 'exercises', 'movements', 'Beginners', 'take', 'note', 'Master', 'Zhou', 'neglecting', 'warm', 'up', 'body', 'properly', 'sufficiently', 'beginning', 'training', 'session', 'could', 'lead', 'injury', 'Master', 'Zhou', 'students', 'take', 'time', 'warm', 'up', 'sufficiently', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'flexible', 'gradually', 'work', 'movements', 'demonstrated.In', 'next', 'three', 'chapters', 'Master', 'Zhou', 'basic', 'stances', 'strikes', 'kicks', 'are', 'found', 'Wudang', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'are', 'also', 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'martial', 'arts', 'styles', 'video', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'demonstration', 'very', 'first', 'form', 'taught', 'style', 'form', 'demonstrated', 'several', 'times', 'various', 'speeds', 'angles', 'broken', 'down', 'individual', 'movements', 'applications.I', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'bit', 'confused', 'watching', 'video', 'style', 'Kng', 'Fu', 'purported', 'be', 'soft', 'style', 'seemed', 'more', 'hard', 'style', 'anything', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'me.Shawn', 'KovacichCreator', 'numerous', 'books', 'DVD']",N/A

1284029,A1XFI340SHOS5K,B002QFW7B2,Zenpony,"[1, 2]","This DVD is rated at the lowest skill level. The instructor, Zhou, Xuan-Yun is master level and he performs all of the material at that level. It's good to see how things should be done at a expert level. However, as a beginner, I think a few more instructions would have been welcome.For example, a full split is shown, but no modified or beginner level adjustments were offered. I, for one, can't picture myself in that full split and I have 15 years tai chi experience. Most of the kicks and punches were shown at full speed and full power. Movements done repeatedly and at a greatly reduced speed would have been helpful.I practice with a Xing-Yi, Bagua teacher who once was a Shaolin coach and many of these kicks and punches are used in his classes. As stated in the DVD, the Southern and Northern styles were integrated somewhat after the training halls were reopened in later years. We practice each kick about 10 times in each class, three times a week. Master Zhou says that beginning Wudang training consists of 30 kicks on each side, in each set, done in sets of three  everyday. That is why his form and power are so beautiful to watch. If that is beginning training, what is advanced?The DVD is very clear and easy to view. The narrator speaks in a nicely paced voice. Opening chapter tells a little about the history of Wudang Mountains and the monks who trained there. I for one, did not know that Wudang is the tallest peak in the range and points to Heaven. All other mountains in the chain lean in and point to Wudang.We are told to warm up each and every time we begin a session and to rest if it becomes too intense. Master Zhou repeats that several times during the film. If we are not warmed up, injury will occur. He even states that stances and punches and kicks can be boring and hard to do for a long time, but we must practice them correctly before learning the form.Clear instruction is given for the warm ups, punching, kicking and form work. Applications are also shown for each move. The insert in the DVD case lists the sequence of the form.This DVD is a five star product, but I feel the skill level is off the mark. It is High Level work done by High Level instructors and a must for any serious internal arts practitioner of the Wudang style.",5,Highest skill level,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,2278,"['DVD', 'rated', 'lowest', 'skill', 'level', 'instructor', 'Zhou', 'Xuan-Yun', 'master', 'level', 'material', 'level', 'good', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'expert', 'level', 'However', 'beginner', 'think', 'few', 'more', 'instructions', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome.For', 'example', 'full', 'split', 'shown', 'modified', 'beginner', 'level', 'adjustments', 'were', 'offered', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'picture', 'full', 'split', 'have', '15', 'years', 'tai', 'chi', 'experience', 'Most', 'kicks', 'punches', 'were', 'shown', 'full', 'speed', 'full', 'power', 'Movements', 'done', 'repeatedly', 'greatly', 'reduced', 'speed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful.I', 'practice', 'Xing-Yi', 'Bagua', 'teacher', 'who', 'once', 'was', 'Shaolin', 'coach', 'many', 'kicks', 'punches', 'are', 'used', 'classes', 'stated', 'DVD', 'Southern', 'Northern', 'styles', 'were', 'integrated', 'somewhat', 'training', 'halls', 'were', 'reopened', 'later', 'years', 'practice', 'kick', '10', 'times', 'class', 'three', 'times', 'week', 'Master', 'Zhou', 'beginning', 'Wudang', 'training', 'consists', '30', 'kicks', 'side', 'set', 'done', 'sets', 'three', 'everyday', 'why', 'form', 'power', 'are', 'so', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'beginning', 'training', 'what', 'advanced', 'DVD', 'very', 'clear', 'easy', 'view', 'narrator', 'nicely', 'paced', 'voice', 'Opening', 'chapter', 'little', 'history', 'Wudang', 'Mountains', 'monks', 'who', 'trained', 'there', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'Wudang', 'tallest', 'peak', 'range', 'points', 'Heaven', 'other', 'mountains', 'chain', 'lean', 'point', 'Wudang.We', 'are', 'told', 'warm', 'up', 'time', 'begin', 'session', 'rest', 'too', 'intense', 'Master', 'Zhou', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'warmed', 'up', 'injury', 'will', 'occur', 'even', 'stances', 'punches', 'kicks', 'can', 'be', 'boring', 'hard', 'do', 'long', 'time', 'must', 'practice', 'correctly', 'learning', 'form.Clear', 'instruction', 'given', 'warm', 'ups', 'punching', 'kicking', 'form', 'work', 'Applications', 'are', 'also', 'shown', 'move', 'insert', 'DVD', 'case', 'sequence', 'form.This', 'DVD', 'five', 'star', 'product', 'feel', 'skill', 'level', 'mark', 'High', 'Level', 'work', 'done', 'High', 'Level', 'instructors', 'must', 'serious', 'internal', 'arts', 'practitioner', 'Wudang', 'style']",N/A
