It appears to be a higher-end production (relative to ultra-low budget) with seemingly ok camera quality, lighting, editing, sound, etc.  However, this delusion is quickly stripped away as the actors talk and action begins.  The movie concept is ridiculous, wickedly overplayed, acting terrible.  The zombie genre has been flogged to death, so any new entrants to this overcroweded category need to do something interesting to stand out.  Unfortunately, the film does stand out, but for the wrong reason; it stands out as so bad, so unwatchable that I can't believe a company agreed to distribute the film.I'm a huge fan of awful movies.  But in each case, there is something that draws me to the film, such as an actor I particularly like, a (sub)genre I love, good writing, good camera work, etc.  Also, those films must at least be watchable, which means the acting is at least not so bad that you cringe at the dialogue.  Again, this film fails on all accounts.  The dialogue is cringe-inducing, the concept tired.

It's an organism that is spread rapidly through direct human contact. The Infected are enslaved by the invading swarm intelligence and driven by an insatiable appetite to consume the Living. When they return home, the infection begins to  spread quickly to their fellow classmates and others. Little by little, more and more people fall victim to the plague, which triggers an epidemic that spawns a horde(and I do mean Horde) of hungry zombies. The horde grows. A campus security guard who's obsessed with conspiracy theories leads a group of students to safety as they and a small group of uninfected townspeople set out to find other humans in an attempt to discover the source of the virus and, ultimately, save the world.Even though this movie is more of the same that we've seen in, practically, every zombie movie that's been made lately, Humans vs. Zombies is a pretty decent low-budget zombie flick. Overall, though, I liked it. The characters are likable and somewhat memorable. The story is good, although a little overused in zombie flicks. It has a good twist at the end.

And then, early on in the movie, when a character ask another character; who is bleeding from their eyes, ""Are you okay?"" ... well, I really thought the movie was going to suck big time! But no, the movie got better! I rather enjoyed the first half of it. However, this is one of those movies that seems to not be completely thought out and becomes rushed toward the end. Script and character development could have used more in-depth thought and several major rewrites ... one such case being that the character of Tommi is a bad ass and has her crap together, she is ready to get up and go with a plan of escape! And then she gets all soft and cuddly,  she then has a freak out segment like a stereo-typical ""horror movie girl"" and then quickly snaps out of that to regain her bad ass self.  There is a lot about the characters that needs to be explained... like why does ""jock"" boy like his comic book reading, HvZ playing, Freshman roommate, especially when ""jock's"" best friend is ""Jack Black""? And why is ""jock"" boy so attracted to bad assed gamer girl who for some reason folks tend to think is a lesbian? And where are they getting the lesbian idea from? Nothing about Tommi's appearance looks like a lesbian! And what makes conspiracy theory campus security guard come to their rescue in the 1st place and what was he doing when the outbreak 1st hit the campus?  Why didn't he try and help some folks then? Really, why is he even in the movie at all? He is the weakest and lamest character (aside from the preacher!) in the whole movie.... I would think that if folks have been playing H vs. Z for a while, wouldn't it have been interesting to make a movie were H vs. Z players were the ones who had the skills and knowledge to survive and help others during a infected / zombie outbreak????Now, with all that said... the acting was pretty good from some of the major cast and though there were a few places of lame, unrealistic dialogue, the 1st half of the movie was pretty believable, and it tied in with the movie`s title. Now, the movie really starts going down hill when they decide to leave a campus building, which I think would probably be easier to lock up and make zombie proof, and run to a hardware store with huge plate glass windows!  H running from Z! Sure, said hardware store has hatchets and machetes and the oh so cool pitchforks that campus security guard is so fascinated by...  but once they get there, do they try and cover up the HUGE glass windows??? No! they get all cozy, eat some Twinkies, have some sex and cuddle until morning!  The movie continues to spiral downward as they somehow are able to see that the infected don't seem to bother with a church and so,  they decide to go there. In the church there is an incredible waste of film as preacher and campus security babble nonsense ...  their budget is just big enough for them to buy a new window for the church cause zombies pop through the window and then the end... or better yet... they decide to end the movie with video footage of zombies eating what could be our final survivors...(H eaten by Z) and who is supposedly shooting said footage?  Instead of making a zombie movie, maybe they should have all gotten together and played H vs. Z for a few months, talked / interviewed folks who played H vs. Z and took notes, written an interesting zombie story, made a script from their story, and then make their zombie movie!",3,Where's the Vs.?,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,3567,"['When', 'saw', 'previews', 'other', 'movies', 'studio', 'produced', 'were', 'directed', 'same', 'director', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'suck', 'then', 'early', 'movie', 'when', 'character', 'ask', 'character', 'who', 'bleeding', 'eyes', 'Are', 'well', 'really', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'suck', 'big', 'time', 'movie', 'got', 'better', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'half', 'However', 'one', 'movies', 'not', 'be', 'completely', 'thought', 'out', 'becomes', 'rushed', 'end', 'Script', 'character', 'development', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'in-depth', 'thought', 'several', 'major', 'rewrites', 'one', 'such', 'case', 'being', 'character', 'Tommi', 'bad', 'ass', 'crap', 'together', 'ready', 'get', 'up', 'go', 'plan', 'escape', 'then', 'soft', 'cuddly', 'then', 'freak', 'out', 'segment', 'stereo-typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'girl', 'then', 'quickly', 'regain', 'bad', 'ass', 'self', 'lot', 'characters', 'be', 'explained', 'why', 'jock', 'boy', 'comic', 'book', 'reading', 'HvZ', 'playing', 'Freshman', 'roommate', 'especially', 'when', 'jock', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Black', 'why', 'jock', 'boy', 'so', 'attracted', 'bad', 'assed', 'gamer', 'girl', 'who', 'reason', 'folks', 'tend', 'think', 'lesbian', 'where', 'are', 'getting', 'lesbian', 'idea', 'Nothing', 'Tommi', 'appearance', 'lesbian', 'what', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'campus', 'security', 'guard', 'come', 'rescue', '1st', 'place', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'when', 'outbreak', '1st', 'hit', 'campus', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'help', 'folks', 'then', 'Really', 'why', 'even', 'movie', 'weakest', 'lamest', 'character', 'aside', 'preacher', 'whole', 'movie', 'would', 'think', 'folks', 'have', 'been', 'playing', 'H', 'vs.', 'Z', 'while', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'make', 'movie', 'were', 'H', 'vs.', 'Z', 'players', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'had', 'skills', 'knowledge', 'survive', 'help', 'others', 'infected', '/', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'Now', 'said', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'major', 'cast', 'were', 'few', 'places', 'lame', 'unrealistic', 'dialogue', '1st', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'believable', 'tied', 'movie', 's', 'title', 'Now', 'movie', 'really', 'going', 'down', 'hill', 'when', 'decide', 'leave', 'campus', 'building', 'think', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'easier', 'lock', 'up', 'make', 'zombie', 'proof', 'run', 'hardware', 'store', 'huge', 'plate', 'glass', 'H', 'running', 'Z', 'Sure', 'said', 'hardware', 'store', 'hatchets', 'machetes', 'oh', 'so', 'cool', 'pitchforks', 'campus', 'security', 'guard', 'so', 'fascinated', 'once', 'get', 'there', 'do', 'try', 'cover', 'up', 'HUGE', 'glass', 'windows', 'No', 'get', 'cozy', 'eat', 'Twinkies', 'have', 'sex', 'cuddle', 'morning', 'movie', 'spiral', 'downward', 'somehow', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'infected', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bother', 'church', 'so', 'decide', 'go', 'there', 'church', 'incredible', 'waste', 'film', 'preacher', 'campus', 'security', 'babble', 'nonsense', 'budget', 'just', 'big', 'enough', 'buy', 'new', 'window', 'church', 'cause', 'zombies', 'pop', 'window', 'then', 'end', 'better', 'yet', 'decide', 'end', 'movie', 'video', 'footage', 'zombies', 'eating', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'final', 'survivors', 'H', 'eaten', 'Z', 'who', 'supposedly', 'shooting', 'said', 'footage', 'Instead', 'making', 'zombie', 'movie', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'together', 'played', 'H', 'Z', 'few', 'months', 'talked', '/', 'interviewed', 'folks', 'who', 'played', 'H', 'Z', 'took', 'notes', 'written', 'interesting', 'zombie', 'story', 'made', 'script', 'story', 'then', 'make', 'zombie', 'movie']",N/A

1523685,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B006ZNPUR4,Stuart Conover,"[2, 3]",Humans vs. Zombies was directed by Brian T. Jaynes and written by both him and Devan Sagliani. It's a tribute to the fans of zombies who have played Humans Versus Zombies on campuses across the United States using Nerf guns and other homemade 'fun' defensive weapons. The game itself is a fun concept and puts us in a good frame of mind for people who may think they are ready for a zombie outbreak - even when they are nowhere near prepared.While the film itself doesn't have the most rock solid of plots or tension building it is a fun watch. I'd recommend watching it with friends so you can get some group effort going to appreciate the humor and mistakes people make as its easily a film that's more fun to watch with a group of friends instead of by yourself. The film itself shows that the zombie apocalypse in this world comes from a strain of H1N1 and gives us a group of geeks and one jock who have 'knowledge' on how to deal with the undead from their years of being drowned in pop culture that has to do with zombies. Throw in a love story between an unlikely couple and you almost have a teen smash hit movie! Just without the teens or hit.I'm really not saying the movie was 'bad' just that it could have been a lot better. Also the introduction to the film could have been much shorter. I LOVED the concept of the movie itself. It was a great lead in to why people think they can survive a zombie outbreak and really have no right to be anywhere but zombie chow or hiding somewhere. The film itself takes the first half to let us know about the characters and the ZVH game that is such a hit on campus. Honestly if they had cut out the getting to know about the characters and got us to the second half of the film quicker it would have worked much better. Honestly I loved the HVZ game theme and mixing that in but I really could have cared less about the characters when we finally got to the second half of the movie (also known as when the zombie outbreak actually hit.)When zombies actually hit we get to see that the special effects are actually decent. The fight scenes that occur are fun to watch and the actors are great to ridicule. Not all of them mind you but some of them use defensive or offensive ideas that were clearly from the comic books or video games that they love with zombies. The problem is fantasy and 'reality' don't quite mash up as they try to use completely ridiculous ideas to stay alive. Fortunately most of the people that follow fantasy don't survive.The end of the film itself I also felt didn't quite fit. It was rather abrupt it how it came to a close. I won't spoil it for you but I felt that it wasn't needed and didn't fit with the close of the film. Possibly if I cared more about the characters or felt that they had a good way to close the film the way they did it would have worked. Sadly though when the end credits rolled you will probably be a little annoyed having the end of the film fall a bit flat and feel as if it was an afterthought to what it looked like they were building to.,3,Too much inexperience drove what could have been a fun zombie flick back into the ground,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,3047,"['Humans', 'vs.', 'Zombies', 'was', 'directed', 'Brian', 'T.', 'Jaynes', 'written', 'Devan', 'Sagliani', 'tribute', 'fans', 'zombies', 'who', 'have', 'played', 'Humans', 'Versus', 'Zombies', 'campuses', 'United', 'States', 'using', 'Nerf', 'guns', 'other', 'homemade', 'defensive', 'weapons', 'game', 'fun', 'concept', 'good', 'frame', 'mind', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'think', 'are', 'ready', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'nowhere', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'most', 'rock', 'solid', 'plots', 'tension', 'building', 'fun', 'watch', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'friends', 'can', 'get', 'group', 'effort', 'going', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'mistakes', 'people', 'make', 'easily', 'film', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'group', 'friends', 'instead', 'film', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'world', 'strain', 'H1N1', 'group', 'geeks', 'one', 'jock', 'who', 'have', ""'knowledge"", 'how', 'deal', 'undead', 'years', 'being', 'drowned', 'pop', 'culture', 'do', 'zombies', 'Throw', 'love', 'story', 'unlikely', 'couple', 'almost', 'have', 'teen', 'smash', 'hit', 'movie', 'Just', 'teens', 'hit.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'saying', 'movie', 'was', ""'bad"", 'just', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'Also', 'introduction', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'shorter', 'LOVED', 'concept', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'lead', 'why', 'people', 'think', 'can', 'survive', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'really', 'have', 'right', 'be', 'anywhere', 'zombie', 'chow', 'hiding', 'somewhere', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'let', 'know', 'characters', 'ZVH', 'game', 'hit', 'campus', 'Honestly', 'had', 'cut', 'out', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'got', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'quicker', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'Honestly', 'loved', 'HVZ', 'game', 'theme', 'mixing', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'characters', 'when', 'finally', 'got', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'also', 'known', 'when', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'actually', 'hit', 'When', 'zombies', 'actually', 'hit', 'get', 'see', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'actually', 'decent', 'fight', 'scenes', 'occur', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'ridicule', 'Not', 'mind', 'use', 'defensive', 'offensive', 'ideas', 'were', 'clearly', 'comic', 'books', 'video', 'games', 'love', 'zombies', 'problem', 'fantasy', ""'reality"", 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'mash', 'up', 'try', 'use', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'ideas', 'stay', 'alive', 'Fortunately', 'most', 'people', 'follow', 'fantasy', 'do', ""n't"", 'survive.The', 'end', 'film', 'also', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'was', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'how', 'came', 'close', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'close', 'film', 'Possibly', 'cared', 'more', 'characters', 'felt', 'had', 'good', 'way', 'close', 'film', 'way', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'Sadly', 'when', 'end', 'rolled', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'little', 'annoyed', 'having', 'end', 'film', 'fall', 'bit', 'flat', 'feel', 'was', 'afterthought', 'what', 'looked', 'were', 'building']",N/A
1523686,A2LC4CQ9J0A6WS,B006ZNPUR4,"The Chief ""The Voice of Reason among hyper-in...","[0, 1]","Humans Vs. Zombies begins succinctly - overtop the credits, we're treated to an essentially silent stream of images that set the stage.  A viral outbreak of some sort is released, which, no surprise, leads to a zombie infestation.  So far so good, but as soon as the title sequence is over, the movie descends into an interminable character-building first act which might be excusable if the characters were anything more substantive than cardboard.  The jock, the jock's crazy fat-muscle buddy, the nerd, the crazy conspiracy-theory-obsessed security guard, the slut, the smart cute girl, the defenseless cute girl - I believe that some of these characters actually had names in the film, but I can't remember any of them.Once these stereotypes are finally established, the zombie craze, which has been sneaking up on them during the first act, finally breaks full tilt.  This is where this movie gets as good as it's going to get, with the survivors attempting to leave the college grounds where the menace overtakes them and hightail it somewhere they can defend.  Still, there's nothing very new here, and to make it worse, the group makes a lot of decisions that seem questionable to ardent zombie junkie fans.  For instance, seeking shelter in a Hardware Store seems sound,  but not one with more windows than walls.There are a couple of twists in the last third of the story - nothing really to raise it above and beyond average.  The actors are just ok - this is a lower budget film, so I give a pass to acting and special effect deficiencies, although the effects aren't bad here at all.  In fact, if they had been in the service of a more inventive plot, then they would fit right in.

1523687,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B006ZNPUR4,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 2]","The film starts out with a zombie virus infection breach then goes headlong into a world infestation. There is a 2 weeks interval between the events. The comic book that comes with the DVD goes into more detail, but really doesn't add anything to the explanation which was given later in the film, one which I really appreciated as it pretended to have some basis in fact. The action takes place on a college campus where students engage in a game called ""Humans vs. Zombies."" These students believe they are zombie experts and then the apocalypse happens (Rev. 20:13).Zombie movies are pretty much the same. Find a safe haven, purge zombies. It is the characters that separate great zombie films from pack. I liked the zombies eating people in front of the ""Humanities"" building and the characters in this film:Tommi (Dora Madison Burge): She has a gamer web site and is a hot cyber chick all the guys want, especially James. She is pretty, smart, savvy, and can make quick decisions. She is the person in charge in the room.James (Jesse Ferraro): He is the football player who wants Tommi and the man she wouldn't have sex with even if he was the last man on earth...not to be taken as an omen or anything. He could have any girl, but wants the one he can't have.Danny (Jonah Priour): He is the studious roommate of James who engages in zombie games. He is our voice of reason, our Jesse Eisenberg from ""Zombieland."" He likes Amanda and shares with her the secret of the zombie metaphor.Amanda (Melissa Carnell): Pretty coed whose clothes everyone borrows. She also has a working shower...I think you know where this is going.Frank (Frederic Doss): Campus Security guard who believes in conspiracy theories. He contends the Illuminati let loose this virus and fellow guard Billy (Matthew Downs) is an alien. In a way he is glad this infection has happened as a point of vindication. Favorite line: ""Back the F-up, zombie trash.""Brad (Chip Joslin): He is the reason I FIVE starred this film. He is the ""Jack Black"" of zombie killers; a humorous over-the-top slightly overweight guy who has funny quips like ""You don't take a sandwich to the beach."" He lives to kill zombies. I wish he was in more scenes.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, brief sex, nudity (Taylor Kowald whose shower is broke.)
