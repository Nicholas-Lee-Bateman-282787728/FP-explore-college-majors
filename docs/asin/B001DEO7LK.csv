There are anywhere between 1-3 discs a case, but there are absolutely no scratch worries whatsoever. I only wish there was a episode guide insert for the season sets, but thats a small issue from where I stand.If there is any complaint, besides the aforementioned non-existant episode guide, it would be the Live in Las Vegas CD album is not in the case.
