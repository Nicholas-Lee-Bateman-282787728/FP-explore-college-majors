Other songs came from Broadway or Tin Pan Alley. The corporate media rarely play Guthrie&#8217;s songs nowadays (they may no longer be relevant to today&#8217;s world). The Great Depression of the 1920s-1930s was the worst economic depression in US history. Most economists could not understand or explain or provide a solution to this condition. If people didn&#8217;t have jobs and money they couldn&#8217;t buy anything, except maybe the necessities. Without sales factories shut down, increasing unemployment and decreasing sales. Calvin Coolidge refused a second term because of this problem Herbert Hoover believed his experience would allow him to do better; it didn&#8217;t.Before the rise of &#8220;rock and roll&#8221; in the 1950s radio music was divided into three categories: country & western (or ethnic music), Broadway show tunes, and classical music. The percentages depended on the locality. Nowadays there&#8217;s a lot of &#8220;talk shows&#8221;. Some are recorded, others allow people to offer their opinions (true or not). A biography of Guthrie would be more educational but wouldn&#8217;t have his songs. This movie has his songs but is not a complete biography. Watch the movie, then read the biography z(if available). Woody&#8217;s support for working people and unions would limit his air play today, even if he hadn&#8217;t developed an incapacitating wasting disease. Maybe more songs and less drama would have made this a better movie? Or a better story that included more history?",4,This was Made for You and Me,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,1652,"['Bound', 'Glory', '1976', 'filmThis', 'movie', 'world', '1930s', 'life', 'Woodrow', 'Wilson', 'Guthrie', 'famous', 'singer', 'folk', 'songs', 'Other', 'songs', 'came', 'Broadway', 'Tin', 'Pan', 'Alley', 'corporate', 'media', 'rarely', 'play', 'Guthrie', '8217', 's', 'songs', 'nowadays', 'may', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'relevant', 'today', '8217', 's', 'world', 'Great', 'Depression', '1920s-1930s', 'was', 'worst', 'economic', 'depression', 'US', 'history', 'Most', 'economists', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'explain', 'provide', 'solution', 'condition', 'people', 'didn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'jobs', 'money', 'couldn', '8217', 'buy', 'anything', 'maybe', 'necessities', 'sales', 'factories', 'shut', 'down', 'increasing', 'unemployment', 'decreasing', 'sales', 'Calvin', 'Coolidge', 'refused', 'second', 'term', 'problem', 'Herbert', 'Hoover', 'believed', 'experience', 'would', 'allow', 'do', 'better', '8217', 'rise', '8220', 'rock', 'roll', '8221', '1950s', 'radio', 'music', 'was', 'divided', 'three', 'categories', 'country', 'western', 'ethnic', 'music', 'Broadway', 'show', 'tunes', 'classical', 'music', 'percentages', 'depended', 'locality', '8217', 's', 'lot', '8220', 'talk', '8221', 'are', 'recorded', 'others', 'allow', 'people', 'offer', 'opinions', 'true', 'not', 'biography', 'Guthrie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'educational', 'wouldn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'songs', 'movie', 'songs', 'not', 'complete', 'biography', 'Watch', 'movie', 'then', 'read', 'biography', 'z', 'available', 'Woody', '8217', 's', 'support', 'working', 'people', 'unions', 'would', 'limit', 'air', 'play', 'today', 'even', '8217', 'developed', 'incapacitating', 'wasting', 'disease', 'Maybe', 'more', 'songs', 'less', 'drama', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'movie', 'better', 'story', 'included', 'more', 'history']",N/A

He ran out on his wife and children in a time when folks were really starving in our fat land. Some one else has to see to his family in a time before we had welfare to assist people who were in need. He went out to California and got involved in labour unions, after seeing the shoddy way the incoming oakie's and other folks who had to migrate west, were treated. Got beaten up, run out of town etc. Took up with other women, then after finally getting a gig to sing on a radio station, he sends for his wife and kids, then basically ignores them once they arrive. She finally leaves and I guess goes back to Texas, and he continues with his labour union attempts to rouse the migrants to protest the way they are treated.

149349,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,0792843568,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","The late Hal Ashby was one of the great maverick directors of the Seventies.  After making his mark as an editor(""In the Heat of the Night"") Ashby helmed many offbeat and personal films.  My personal faves are ""Harold and Maude"" and ""Being There"".  I'm still waiting for his directorial debut, ""The Landlord"", to become available on DVD.  ""Bound for Glory"" was a very enigmatic film for me.  I admired how Ashby depicts the breadth of the suffering during the Great Depression from the dust parched Texas landscapes to the harsh conditions of the California workfarms.  Cinematographer Haskell Wexler can be thanked for a large part of the film's power.  As a biography, however, I think the film falls short.  I didn't know much about Woody Guthrie before watching this film and quite frankly I don't think ""Bound for Glory"" offers much insight into the man.  My knowledge of Guthrie mainly consists of him being Arlo's father and mentor to Bob Dylan.  Like Dylan, Guthrie is portayed as a man of contradictions and enigmas.  But there's nothing here that suggests why Guthrie became the spokesperson for the long-suffering working class.  David Carradine is a good actor but he is unable to make sense to the viewer what Guthrie is all about.

149351,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,0792843568,Dr. James Gardner,"[0, 1]","""Bound for Glory"" is a 1976 Oscar winning biography about folk singer Woody Guthrie, based on Guthrie's own 1943 autobiography of the same name. It covers the period 1936 to 1940 when Guthrie left Texas and went to California, and having established himself as a successful artist, left for New York. Guthrie (1912-67) virtually invented the ""folk"" genre of music with songs like ""This Land is Your Land"" and ""Plane Wreck at Los Gatos"", and was a major influence on the careers of Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and John Mellencamp (among others).""As I was walking a ribbon of highway I saw above me an endlessskyway I saw below me a golden valley This land was made for youand me.""David Carradine (1936-2009) stars as Guthrie. To older people, David Carradine will always be best remembered as the Emmy and Golden Globe nominated Kwai Chang Caine from the TV series ""Kung Fun"", but for younger people, he is the notorious Bill in the ""Kill Bill"" films. Carradine received 4 Golden Globe nominations over his career (""Kung Fu"" in 1972, ""Bound for Glory"" in 1976, ""North and South"" in 1985, and ""Kill Bill 2"" in 2004).Cute Melinda Dillon (1939) plays Guthrie's wife. Dillon is best known for her roles in ""Close Encounters"" (1977) and ""Absence of Malice"" (1981) for which she received Oscar nominations.""I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps To thesparkling sands of her diamond deserts And all around me avoice was sounding This land was made for you and me.""Ronny Cox (1938) plays Ozark Blue, a union organizer who hires Woody as a singer. Cox made his film debut as one of the dueling banjo players from ""Deliverance"" (1972) and went on to appear in nearly 100 films and TV shows. He's probably best known for his co-starring roles in the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""RoboCop"" films.Randy Quaid plays an Okie who befriends Guthrie. Quaid was Oscar nominated for ""The Last Detail"" (1973) and received 3 Emmy nominations - ""Elvis"" (2005), ""LBJ"" (1987), and ""Streetcar Named Desire"" (1984).""The sun comes shining as I was strolling The wheat fields wavingand the dust clouds rolling The fog was lifting a voice comechanting This land was made for you and me.""Look for James Hong (1929) as a chili store owner. Hong appeared with Carradine in his ""Kung Fu"" Series but is probably best known for the ""Kung Fu Panda"" films though his best work was as Lo Pan in ""Big Trouble in Little China"" (1986).Hal Ashby (1929-88) directs. He won an Oscar for ""In the Heat of the Night"" (1967) and was nominated for ""Coming Home"" (1978) and ""The Russians are Coming"" (1966). He was nominated 3 times for a Golden Globe - ""Bound for Glory"" (1976), ""Coming Home"" (1978) and ""Being There"" (1979).Haskell Wexler (1926) won his second Oscar for cinematography for this film, and had 3 more nominations over his career. In this film he introduced the use of the Steadica (during the migrant camp sequence).  Personally I think his best work was ""Medium Cool"" (1969).The top grossing films in 1976 were ""Rocky"", ""A Star is Born"", ""All the President's Men"", and ""The Omen"". The big Oscar winners were ""Rocky"" (Picture, Director) and ""Network""  (Actor, Actress, Supporting Actress). Other notable films that year were ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Marathon Man"", and ""Midway"".""As I was walkin' - I saw a sign there And that sign said - notress passin' But on the other side .... it didn't say nothing!Now that side was made for you and me!""""Bound for Glory"" won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Music. It was nominated for Costume Design, Film Editing, Picture, and Writing. The film received 4 Golden Globe nominations (Picture, Actor, Director, Actress) and Carradine won an NBR for Best Actor.Roger Ebert called the film ""so beautiful"" and ""the most visually accomplished film since ""Barry Lyndon"", but he found it ""slow moving"". The Village Voice called it a ""musical odyssey"" and praised Carradine as ""magnificent"".The film is more than 2 hours long, and the first 30 minutes is exceedingly slow. I suppose the director is trying to set a pace and re-create an era, but 30 minutes seems excessive. The film picks up when he leaves Texas to join the Okies migration to California in 1936.It's hard to watch this film and not compare it with ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1939), the John Ford/Henry Fonda classic film about the depression and the farm workers in California (Interestingly enough, David Carradine's father John had a major part in this film). Personally I think ""GoW"" is a far better portrait of the era, which isn't to say that ""Glory"" doesn't do a good job. Perhaps it is the stark black and white photography or the fact that ""GoW"" had truly great performances""In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple Nearthe relief office - I see my people And some are grumblin' andsome are wonderin' If this land's still made for you and me.""Bottom line - a good film that will appeal to fans of folk music and Americana.",4,Unusual film

They try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives, and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives.  This is not one of those films.  It just covers Woody Guthrie's adult life, from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer, and his passionate defense of the working man.  The look of the film is deliberate, in that it's washed out.  The hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film.  They're really lively, where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves.  The film has a real genuine feel to it, like you're actually watching real people.  David Carradine is amazing as Woody Guthrie.  He makes you think you're actually watching Woody himself.  He did his own singing and stuntwork on the film.  Ronny Cox is excellent as well, and he does his own singing too (remember, Cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in Deliverance).

It is a long movie, and if you are not interested in Guthrie or his music it might be too long. If, like me, you are a follower of Guthrie and his music, it just might end up being too short. One of the chief characters is not actually real. Ronny Cox plays a man named Ozark Beule (sp?) who turns out to be a composite of several people who were influential in Guthrie's life who introduces the restless young man to life as a radio performer. This is his first real start in bringing his songs to the public and he does so very well. He and Ozark travel together trying to get people, especially migrant workers, interested in joining a union and getting in trouble with the law while they do so. The movie itself has plenty of Guthrie songs, as well as him singing songs written by others, but the closing credits is when you hear other famous singers sing his songs and is something I look forward to whenever I watch this movie. It was tragic that he more or less deserted his wife and children while traveling country writing and singing songs, but it was something in him he could not suppress or deny.

This has been a common technique in radio to allow the listener to create in their own mind, what is being expressed to them.  Sometimes; this is referred to as ""visual imagery"".The movie ""Leadbelly"" attempts to do both.  Create from the book which is a meandering ofWoody Guthrie's attempt to put into words what he lived......... and yet; he was basically illiterate. So he ""described"" as best he could what he lived or experienced because what he saw was real to him.Such is the case with this movie which I'll admit takes some creative license from the book; but my guess is that the author did the same too.The biggest difference between the book and the movie is the obvious:  Hearing the music.The performances are accurate and if you don't know the music at all, it will at least interest you to want to buy the ""original soundtrack"" but that is only part of the story.To hear Woody's voice singing about what he's experiencing can only be done by someone who has ""lived"" what they are writing about.  There is a different feeling and expression and it comes through but either way; to the ""laymen"" you still get to hear the music.Woody Guthrie is yet another tragic figure who knew his time on earth was ""limited"" and thankfully; we have his son Arlo who has managed to avoid the sickness his father died from and has been able to combine his own style, technique and personality to his own music; while paying tribute to his father.  Yet, he is not overwhelmed by his famous father.Get the DVD.  Allow for some of the imperfections and inaccuracies unless you are ""nit-picker"" in which case; I can't argue with you because you are already right and can't change your mind.In the end, you will come away with a movie that will teach you about a unique man who lived the life he wrote about (Jimmy Rodgers a.k.a. the brakeman as a second suggestion) and a piece of Americana which offers a straightforward look into what makes someone become what they are and the price they paid for it.

His prolific song writing, grass roots activism, and even his influence on other song writers like Bob Dylan and Steve Earle are only partially responsible for that legend.  Woody represents a classic American type - the ramblin' man with no fixed home who champions the underdog wherever the wind may blow him, and therein lies the heart of the legend. This film captures that aspect of Woody superbly.`Bound for Glory' covers Woody's life from just before he left dust bowl Texas to his first sojourn into the sugar bowl of California. It expertly captures the harsh conditions and brutal treatment that inspired many of Woody's songs. From dust storms, desperate migrations via highway and railway, to the squalid conditions of California migrant camps, this film recreates the world that Woody saw.David Carradine gives a career best performance as Woody. He captures Guthrie's ambiguous nature - from his genuine concern for the downtrodden and oppressed to his irresponsibility in shirking his obligations to his own family. His performance powerfully embodies Guthrie's fierce independence, restlessness, and gut-level dissatisfaction with the system.This film is a superb addition to the Guthrie legend.
