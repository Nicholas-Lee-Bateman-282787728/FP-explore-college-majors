497293,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,B00000F39T,Bruce Rux,"[14, 17]","One of the best of the early 1970s T.V. horror movies.Newlyweds Kim Darby and Jim Hutton inherit Darby's recently deceased grandmother's house, where her grandfather mysteriously disappeared decades ago.  Darby wants to open the bricked-up basement fireplace to convert the room into a study, but old family handyman William Demarest adamantly opposes the idea, insisiting that ""some things are best left alone.""  She opens it anyway, and soon finds herself bedeviled at night by three little green men now released from their prison.  They whisper to her and laugh, menace her with straight-razors, and even murder the interior decorator before anyone begins to believe she isn't imagining seeing the nasty little things.  Darby's friend, Barbara Anderson, and handyman Demarest, try to convince Hutton before it's too late that his wife's life is in grave danger.  In fact, whatever the little men have in store for her might be even worse  -  they seem to want to take Darby away with them forever, even if they have to do so with her kicking and screaming the whole way...This movie succeeds for a number of reasons, one of which is its short-story brevity  -  it runs only seventy-two minutes  -  which keeps the suspense and the atmosphere menacing, throughout.  The production itself is gorgeous, with good use of light and shadow and an especially eerie Billy Goldenberg score.  The performers are all terrific  -  Darby, especially, who never turns in a poor performance, and Demarest as the haunted man who knows much more than he can safely reveal.  The little gremlins are downright upsetting, and the effects used to make them look so small are pretty convincing.  The story concludes with most of its own questions unanswered, leaving the viewer deeply unsettled by the movie's chillingly creepy ambiguous ending.On an interesting side-note, this shuddery human-abducting little-green-men story was released three weeks before Halloween, at the height of the biggest UFO wave ever seen in the United States.",5,Gremlins and Goblins and Little Green Men,1031788800,"09 12, 2002",2002,2021,"['One', 'best', 'early', '1970s', 'T.V', 'horror', 'movies.Newlyweds', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'Darby', 'recently', 'deceased', 'grandmother', 'house', 'where', 'grandfather', 'mysteriously', 'disappeared', 'decades', 'ago', 'Darby', 'open', 'bricked-up', 'basement', 'fireplace', 'convert', 'room', 'study', 'old', 'family', 'handyman', 'William', 'Demarest', 'adamantly', 'idea', 'insisiting', 'things', 'are', 'best', 'left', 'alone', 'anyway', 'soon', 'finds', 'bedeviled', 'night', 'three', 'little', 'green', 'men', 'now', 'released', 'prison', 'whisper', 'laugh', 'menace', 'straight-razors', 'even', 'murder', 'interior', 'decorator', 'anyone', 'believe', ""n't"", 'imagining', 'seeing', 'nasty', 'little', 'things', 'Darby', 'friend', 'Barbara', 'Anderson', 'handyman', 'Demarest', 'try', 'convince', 'Hutton', 'too', 'late', 'wife', 'life', 'grave', 'danger', 'fact', 'whatever', 'little', 'men', 'have', 'store', 'might', 'be', 'even', 'worse', 'seem', 'want', 'take', 'Darby', 'away', 'forever', 'even', 'have', 'do', 'so', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'whole', 'way', 'movie', 'number', 'reasons', 'one', 'short-story', 'brevity', 'only', 'seventy-two', 'minutes', 'suspense', 'atmosphere', 'menacing', 'production', 'gorgeous', 'good', 'use', 'light', 'shadow', 'especially', 'eerie', 'Billy', 'Goldenberg', 'score', 'performers', 'are', 'terrific', 'Darby', 'especially', 'who', 'never', 'poor', 'performance', 'Demarest', 'haunted', 'man', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'safely', 'reveal', 'little', 'gremlins', 'are', 'downright', 'upsetting', 'effects', 'used', 'make', 'look', 'so', 'small', 'are', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'story', 'most', 'own', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'deeply', 'unsettled', 'movie', 'chillingly', 'ambiguous', 'interesting', 'side-note', 'shuddery', 'human-abducting', 'little-green-men', 'story', 'was', 'released', 'three', 'weeks', 'Halloween', 'height', 'biggest', 'UFO', 'wave', 'ever', 'seen', 'United', 'States']",Don't Be Afraid of the Dark VHS

I am appalled that Amazon doesn't keep the prices in line. I don't care if it is out of print, that's no excuse for selling it at 6 or more times what you paid for it. Your Kharma will teach you the error of your ways scalpers.All time classic spooky TV movie with the Victorian house, demons,  and good acting to give the right elements to make it memorable. My wife says she loves it since she never forgot it since seeing it  years ago. Only one problem I see here is that this wonderful movie is hard to get on DVD and Amazon lets scalpers sell it on VHS for outrageous prices. Personally I waited for the DVD since with this cast and good story, sets, music, et cetera some bright studio exec will distribute it soon.The story premise is a couple move into an old victorian home and start to renovate it. Rumors begin to be revealed as to it's history being steeped in dark secrets of nefarious activities. We are left to draw our own conclusions but when things start to happen to the woman that lend credence we all feel a cold chill run down our spine and it is to late to stop. Be prepared to have nightmares or at least be looking over your shoulder or doing a double take on shadows.I'm glad I was lucky enough to get a 30th Anniversary DVD from movietracker while they had some.

Fear and paranoia reign supreme in this twisted tale that recently received the remake treatment thanks to Guillermo del Toro and director Troy Nixey. Kim Darby plays the unassuming Sally Farnham, whose curiosity gets the best of her when she betrays the handyman's warnings and opens the bolted furnace found in a secret study. We watch as she slowly begins to lose her mind as the small, rat-like creatures terrorize her in an attempt to steal her soul. Darby is fantastic in the role, truly selling her fear and anxiety while her husband dismisses her pleas for help as childish fantasy. Ed Graves' impressive production designs convincingly scale the monsters down to their miniature size, while the most frightening moments of the film arrive when the creatures beckon Sally with their wicked voices from deep within the darkness.

When I finally saw it I was pleasantly surprised -- it holds up very well.  It's highly enjoyable and eerie with a couple of moments to make you jump.  There's no denying that it screams ""70's TV movie!"" but it works.  In fact, after watching it back to back with the 2010 version I can say that I preferred the original.  Obviously the remake has a bigger budget, much better FX, sets and production values (it's a pretty good fright film too) but the original beats it hands-down for spooky nostalgic fun.  Well worth seeing -- go get it!A NOTE ON THE DVD:  Warner Archives has released this twice.  The older version (in a blue case with a small color photo) is very dark and murky.  It's hard to even see what's going on in some scenes.  Then, Warner remastered and re-released it when the remake came out.  The difference is like night and day.  The picture is bright and sharp with strong, vivid colors, there's no comparison at all.  Unfortunately there's no blu-ray available, but the DVD looks remarkably good for a TV movie from 1973.

The DVD itself working fine in my Bluray player and the menu had a simple Play option and instructions to hit the forward and back buttons to go back and forward 10 minute intervals. The movie itself looked pretty good considering its age! There were a few specs here and there and it obviously had not been cleaned up or remastered, but it wasn't bad at all.

Don't Be Afraid of the Dark was originally made for TV back in 1973. There are movies that stick with you for the rest of your life- this movie stuck with me!! It's the creepiest movie that I have ever seen. I saw it a few years ago on late night TV and it scared me just as much as it did when I was a kid!!  Don't Be Afraid of the Dark starts with a young couple inheriting an old victorian style house. They don't know that the house is inhabited by three small demons that are locked in a blocked off fireplace.  The caretaker, played by William Demarest(Uncle Charlie from &quot;My Three Sons&quot;) warns Sally,played by Kim Darby, that some things are better left alone when she wants the old fireplace opened up. Sally attempts to open the fireplace thus releasing the three small demons into the house.They then want her for thier own. Strange things begin to happen around the house and Sally at first begins to question her own sanity. She sees the demons and her husband Alex, played by Jim Hutton, does not believe her.  I think the scariest part of this movie is how vulnerable Sally feels. She cannot feel safe even at a dinner party (she sees one of the demons on her lap under a napkin)  The demons cannot stand light and only attack in the dark. I can still hear the whispering whenever I think of this movie. Sally.....Sally......Sally.....Sally.....  Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is the creepiest movie ever made.

These were those long gone days  before the advent of video, dvds, cable, ect. Both myself, and older brother, happened to be alone in the house that evening. And being just kids we found the promos for ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"" quite intriguing, to say the least. Nothing could have prepared me for the terror that this supernatual thriller would impress upon my young, undeveloped mind. Leave it to say, these demonic creatures, who were unknowingly released via a closed-up fireplace (*probably a gateway to hell itself*) unnerved me like nothing else before it. Kim Darby's character of Sally was in continual peril since opening up this ""Pandora's Box"". I remember both myself, and my brother, pleading loudly for Sally's husband, girlfriend, ""OR ANYBODY"" TO GET HER OUT OF THAT OLD CREEPY VICTORIAN HOUSE.Sadly for Sally, and all of us helplessly watching, this was not meant to be. Instead we watched in utter horror as Sally is literly dragged down to hell by these (*Hob-Goblins maybe??) satanic creatures. After this, I remember our mother turning off the lights when both me, and my brother, had gone to bed. But sure enough, when the coast was clear, one of us would jump up and turn those friggin' lights right back on. This only went on for about a month or six. I'd imagine that during the premiere of this film the surrounding electric companies must have made a fortune, scatching their heads, trying to figure out why?? I'm sure Con Ed made a bundle from our house alone. I have recently watched the film on dvd again after all these years. It still hasn't lost it's bite. I think before going to bed tonight I'll at least put in a new lightbuld and check the fuses for good measure. As far as the re-make is concerned, I never bothered with it and most likely never will. Just like the carpenter, Mr. Harris, had said in the original film; ""Some things are simply better left alone"", I most certainly agree. Anyway, it's getting dark. So I'd better check up on those lightbulbs..:(p.s.

The first time I saw this on TV I was scared silly, afraid to go to sleep, every whisper in the house suddenly became suspect.  Of course now, decades later, it seems rather tame.  A variation on the haunted house genre, this particular mansion has previous occupants residing in the fireplace.  They want out.  ""Set us free!""I love how this movie starts with the disembodied voices of the little creatures paired with images of the empty house, continuing on with the voices of the new owners, as of yet also unseen.  It's a great story not used to its best advantage.  The pacing could have been better, the suspense tighter, the acting more uniform (Jim Hutton's bluster seems oddly extreme under the circumstances, while Kim Darby was almost complacent at times when fear was due).  I admit that my love for this movie is more sentimental and nostalgic than because of any artistic merit.  Still, it is a fun movie to watch as long as your expectations are clearly aligned with the realization that this was done for television back in 1973, the frights aren't going to be as graphic.

It is a generally dark looking movie with very few daytime scenes. It does have lots of slow parts with people standing around doing the drama thing (which I don't really mind in 70s / 80s movies for some reason) but the creeping menace is always right around the corner. The score is deeply disturbing and is ever present which really helps maintain the eerie mood. This scary flick culminates in a nail-biting ending that is truly nightmarish! In fact I'd say that the creepier scenes in this movie do indeed have that seriously scary 'nightmare' quality that eludes lesser horror films. Check it out if you haven't already!

When Sally starts the redecorating along with her pompous decorator she comes across a locked room in the house. After arguing with the handyman (William Demarest ""Uncle Charlie"" on ""My Three Sons)who insists she should leave the room locked, she finally gets the key. But once she opens her father's old study and has the bricks from the fireplace removed, strange things begin to happen. Sally begins to see small creatures everywhere, but no one will believe her. Her husband dismisses her as neurotic and her friend thinks Sally may be loosing her mind. But things take a deadly serious turn when the decorator trips at the top of the stairs and falls to his death. Sally sees a rope lying across the place where he tripped, but when she picks it up to take it, a horrifying little creature pulls it from her grasp. Is she crazy? Or has Sally released demons in the house, demons her father summoned?This is one of the best '70's suspense movies that was made for TV (or even the theater!) and still has yet to be released to DVD.

497327,A366S12KCZ280V,B00000F39T,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[1, 1]","Way back in the day when television was interesting to watch, meaning before reality TV programs, they use to have what they called movies of the week. Usually an hour and a half in length and usually low budget these TV movies were sometimes not very good but a lot of times they could make some really good entertaining movies. One of those movies being ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"". Starring Kim Darby ( of ""True Grit"" fame) and Jim Hutton they play a young couple who has inherited an old house from a family member who died. Upon moving in Kim Darby finds a fireplace she would love to able to use except it is closed up with bricks and cement. Also the metal door use to open to clean out the chimmny is bolted shut with a warning from the local handyman not to try to open it under no circumstances. Of course you probably can figure out what happens next. Kim Darby's character, named Sally, just has to find a way to look inside the fireplace and is able to remove the bolt and open the door. Unknown to her there are three demon like critters that had been sealed up inside that has now be let loose and they are coming after Sally. From there I don't want to tell anymore about the plot for the benefit of anyone who has not seen the TV movie version of ""Don't Be Afriad Of The Dark"" or who may have seen it decades ago when it first on TV and don't remember what happens next.I have read many reviews here on Amazon on the made for TV flick and by far the most common comment I read is how the reviewer first saw this movie as a kid and was scared to death by it. Count me among that group to. I would have been 17 myself when I saw the TV debut of ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"" and it was one of the scariest movies I rememeber seeing at that time. It was well acted with good film editing that could give you a good creepy feeling while watching. The special effects were decent for the times. By todays standards many folks might say the special effects are cheesy at best. They might say the same thing to about the plot of the movie as well. You have to remember though that as a movie of the week there wasn't a hugh budget to work with. Plus they didn't have the luxury of time to put the film together and shoot it and certainly at that time didn't have the technical equipment on hand to make really outstanding special effects. Still with what they had to work with this is a first rate movie and I would have to agree with a statement I read about ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"" that it is the best horror movie ever made for television. I would also rate it as one of the best overall made for TV movies ever filmed. I would rate it up there with some other made for TV movies like ""Trilogy Of Terror"" (starring Karen Black) and ""The Night Stalker"" (which would lead to the TV series ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" starring Darren McGavin).

Jim hutton plays her husband who does not beleive her when she tells him that she sees these things and they want her for some reason. William Demerest who played uncle charlie on ""My three son's"" is also on hand as a handy man who is aware of the houses sinister inhabitants but says nothing about them for fear of retaliation.  this film works on the notion that less is more. The three demon like thing are very spooky to see. The miniature sets are wonderfully done and give the illusion that the demons are actually quite small but scary.

497333,A72A8JDQK4D8S,B00000F39T,John A. Lind,"[4, 6]","This film was made for the 1973 season of the ABC Movie of the Week (Wednesday evenings).which filled a 1-1/2 hour (90 minute) time slot with original movies made specifically for television.broadcast. As such they were low budget, approx. $400k, and were shot in TV studios and sound stages, not cinema. As a 1973 film, it was done in 1.33:1 (aka &#34;Academy ratio&#34;) for the 4:3 analog NTSC TVs on which it would be viewed. Run time is 74 minutes to fit into the 90 minute time slot with 18% (16 minutes) allocated to commercials and station breaks, the standard for that era (in 1980 it was 20%; today it's 30%). There is no widescreen original film. Because they were made for TV broadcast, these films also had to comply with the &#34;Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters,&#34; an industry code that was akin to cinema's Draconian &#34;Hays Code&#34; and even stricter in some aspects. It was set up to keep the Congress and FCC out of their knickers over objectionable content (which was continuously threatened). In spite of how mild broadcast TV was then, groups of people would complain (to FCC and elected govt. officials) about everything broadcast.With that in mind, this one was right up to the boundaries of what was allowed in 1973 regarding its &#34;horror&#34; content. Note also that you NEVER see Hutton and Darby in bed together -- it's either one or the other -- and you hear most of the violence occur, but don't see it actually happen, just what it looks like afterward. There's also zero blood. This is actually one of the better ABC Weekly movies from the early 1970's and it deservedly has a cult following. In spite of the constraints which result in a fair amount of goofiness for a horror film, it still has some suspense and tension. I did not expect the ending which I won't describe as it would be an enormous spoiler.Regarding the video and audio quality, the Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo audio is OK considering the original monaural made for 1973 era TV set lo-fidelity sound reproduction. High fidelity sound was just barely making it into some cinema theaters and the films were, for the most part, still monaural ; it would have been a complete waste of budget to do anything special. Video quality is the enormous disappointment. Dirt, hairs, emulsion pits, scratches and dropouts are quite prevalent throughout. Remastered? What was remastered? The film used for transfer was quite obviously not cleaned and nothing was done with the digital scan to deal with all the film flaws (e.g. scratches). Perhaps there was something done with the color, brightness, contrast and gamma. If so, it isn't evident. The only thing that had any special treatment was the audio. In spite of the specs and the DVD case (for the Remastered, Special Edition DVD), the audio is Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo at 192 kbps, either from an original stereo sound recorded during filming, or the original monaural remixed. In any event it's obviously stereo and not 2-channel monaural.The movie gets 3-1/2 stars as it's one of the better ABC &#34;Movie of The Week&#34; films from the early 1970's but it's not anything that would garner consideration for any awards, TV or cinema. Certainly worthy of its cult status though. The production design, props and special effects all reflect its budget and the need to film it very quickly (having to produce an original 1-1/4 hour movie per week). The technical aspects of the DVD transfer get 1-1/2 stars with a half-star up from just 1 for the decent stereo remix, but the shoddy video drags it way down.",3,Remastered??

ABC's Movie of the Week was working hard to draw viewers from NBC and CBS in the early 70's, and it worked. Many of the ABC TV flicks were high quality.  Of course, the budgets were very low.  But imaginations ran high, and talented filmmakers like Dan Curtis, Steven Speilberg and John Newland (One Step Beyond) decided to make a name for themselves using TV as their platform.Newland helmed Don't be Afraid..., and the plot is very simple.  A young woman, who's had mental difficulties in the past, starts seeing tiny monsters in her brand new home.  Of course, her husband thinks she's having another breakdown. Why are these monsters after her? Who knows? Hitchcock would call the reason a MacGuffin (a plot device that keeps the story moving, but is not important in itself).Newland keeps the house VERY dark, to create atmosphere and also to hide certain shortcomings.  But the movie works on a psychological level.  A child's fear of the dark (the vast majority of the viewing audience had to be under 18). Simple, and very effective.As far as the DVD, this is the only TV movie of that era and genre yet to be released.  I'd say it's just a matter of time.

If you own this movie on VHS or the previous DVD incarnation, let me say that this is definitely worth the upgrade. You can actually see what is going on instead of just hearing it and seeing a dark, grainy screen. Is it perfect? No, but it looks pretty darn good for a 40 year old made for TV movie. A flick like this probably isn't going to win over many new fans in this day and age when people are used to lightning-quick-editing and digital effects but if you are in the mood for a creepy haunted house story, which emphasizes atmosphere, and a slow, suspenseful build, this is one you'll want to watch - alone, in the dark, with your cell phone off. Great acting, quick moving story, awesome ending!The only complaint I have is that some scenes towards the end of the movie have not been remastered correctly, they were shot in the daytime and were supposed to be readjusted to look like night, but they forgot to do it in this edition and so we wind up with some ridiculously obvious daytime scenes that are supposed to pass for nighttime.The only ""extras"" are a commentary by some ""fans"" of the movie which seems to me like a Mystery Science Theater 3000 type of thing that I have zero interest in.Recommended for nostalgia purposes for people who saw it years ago, or for fans of 1970's haunted house creepers.",5,"You Don't Have To Be Afraid of The ""Dark"" Any Longer With This New Remastered DVD",1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,1501,"['Widely', 'considered', 'be', 'best', 'made-for-TV', 'horror', 'flick', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'finally', 'lights', 'turned', 'little', 'remastered', 'edition', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'own', 'movie', 'VHS', 'previous', 'DVD', 'incarnation', 'let', 'say', 'definitely', 'worth', 'upgrade', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'instead', 'just', 'hearing', 'seeing', 'dark', 'grainy', 'screen', 'perfect', 'No', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', '40', 'year', 'old', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'flick', 'probably', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'over', 'many', 'new', 'fans', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'used', 'lightning-quick-editing', 'digital', 'effects', 'are', 'mood', 'creepy', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'atmosphere', 'slow', 'suspenseful', 'build', 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'alone', 'dark', 'cell', 'phone', 'off', 'Great', 'acting', 'quick', 'moving', 'story', 'awesome', 'ending', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'scenes', 'end', 'movie', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'remastered', 'correctly', 'were', 'shot', 'daytime', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'readjusted', 'look', 'night', 'forgot', 'do', 'edition', 'so', 'wind', 'up', 'ridiculously', 'obvious', 'daytime', 'scenes', 'are', 'supposed', 'pass', 'nighttime.The', 'only', 'extras', 'are', 'commentary', 'fans', 'movie', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'type', 'thing', 'have', 'zero', 'interest', 'in.Recommended', 'nostalgia', 'purposes', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'fans', '1970', 'haunted', 'house', 'creepers']",Don't Be Afraid of the Dark VHS

497337,AVL3JQB3S2JIC,B00000F39T,"Kurt Hausch ""ronin""","[2, 2]","I was a kid growing up on the island of St.Thomas,U.S.V.I.when I saw this movie.It was broadcast from the 40 mile distant island of St.Croix on channel 8.The islands were nowhere near getting cable t.v. In those days,everything came in on the airwave UHF band.About 13 at the time,I was a certified N.A.U.I. diver with a considerable amount of bottom time,(I literally dove every day).Thought I was pretty tough for a kid.Till I saw this movie...My parents were off island,I was more or less on  my own,(It was a different time.) sat back and watched this thing on the tuesday night movie of the week.You can become indifferent to T.V. after a while,putting the broadcast on the background while you do chores or whatever.This movie got my attention immediately.Its pace was different,the unidentifiable sense of dread drew me in.I was a veteran of all the horror classics of the time.Thought (and still do) that the genre was very underrated.Still,""Dark"" caught me off guard.Such a nightmare like quality,the unknowing unease,the horror of discovery,the trapped panic of the encounters and the subsequent guerrilla like attacks wove a tapestry that was unlike anything I'd seen.The fact that the director didnt show the creatures all the time,made them...low tech that they might be...more scary than they really were. There wasnt a need for special effects of the T.V. kind,this could have just as easily been done on a stage.It had a reality to it.At the end (like a bad acid experience)I was traumatized,exhausted and confused. The elation I felt from the experience of something decent on T.V. and the ""Man, I gotta get the hell outta here"" sense of unease that resulted, was pulling me in two different ways.(years later, when I found a copy,I actually hesitated on buying it.)It was the first time that something produced for T.V. entertained me.I wasnt use to it.In those days, ours was the only house on that part of the island.An old,old,old,Danish place from the sugar cane days,so high up in the hills,we couldnt even get a phone line installed.W.A.P.A., the local water and power authority,had a lot of problems back then.We had ""blackouts"" all the time.Just as I was recovering from the mental and physical beating that""Dark"" had given me...The power goes out.This movie took something that was mundane and harmless,and made it really pretty freaky.The power didnt come back on till 4 a.m. I did manage to sleep,but only with my back to the wall.Later...when my mom asked me why I had a flashlight taped to my speargun,I could only smile and say it was just an idea.I still watch this movie from time to time, and I do manage to sleep with the lights out.But then it is easier,what with my M-4 with the surefire light attached. I just know that they're out there...As a post script, I would like to point out that I have written this review previously.But someone,for some neurotic reason, felt somehow offened by my opinion, and complained to Amazon.So due to that persons shallow sensibilities,I have to rewrite this review for this really cool little movie.",5,Dont be afraid of the movie...,1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,3074,"['was', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', 'island', 'St.Thomas', 'U.S.V.I.when', 'saw', 'movie.It', 'was', 'broadcast', '40', 'mile', 'distant', 'island', 'St.Croix', 'channel', '8.The', 'islands', 'were', 'nowhere', 'getting', 'cable', 't.v', 'days', 'everything', 'came', 'airwave', 'UHF', '13', 'time', 'was', 'certified', 'N.A.U.I', 'diver', 'considerable', 'amount', 'bottom', 'time', 'literally', 'dove', 'day', '.Thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'tough', 'kid.Till', 'saw', 'movie', 'parents', 'were', 'off', 'island', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'own', 'was', 'different', 'time', 'sat', 'back', 'watched', 'thing', 'tuesday', 'night', 'movie', 'week.You', 'can', 'become', 'indifferent', 'T.V', 'while', 'putting', 'broadcast', 'background', 'do', 'chores', 'whatever.This', 'movie', 'got', 'attention', 'immediately.Its', 'pace', 'was', 'different', 'unidentifiable', 'sense', 'dread', 'drew', 'in.I', 'was', 'veteran', 'horror', 'classics', 'time.Thought', 'still', 'do', 'genre', 'was', 'very', 'underrated.Still', 'Dark', 'caught', 'off', 'nightmare', 'quality', 'unknowing', 'unease', 'horror', 'discovery', 'trapped', 'panic', 'encounters', 'subsequent', 'guerrilla', 'attacks', 'wove', 'tapestry', 'was', 'anything', ""'d"", 'seen.The', 'fact', 'director', 'didnt', 'show', 'creatures', 'time', 'made', 'low', 'tech', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'scary', 'really', 'were', 'need', 'special', 'effects', 'T.V', 'kind', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'easily', 'been', 'done', 'stage.It', 'had', 'reality', 'it.At', 'end', 'bad', 'acid', 'experience', 'was', 'traumatized', 'exhausted', 'confused', 'elation', 'felt', 'experience', 'something', 'decent', 'T.V', 'Man', 'got', 'ta', 'get', 'hell', 'outta', 'here', 'sense', 'unease', 'resulted', 'was', 'pulling', 'two', 'different', 'ways', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'found', 'copy', 'actually', 'hesitated', 'buying', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'something', 'produced', 'T.V', 'entertained', 'me.I', 'wasnt', 'use', 'it.In', 'days', 'ours', 'was', 'only', 'house', 'part', 'island.An', 'old', 'old', 'old', 'Danish', 'place', 'sugar', 'cane', 'days', 'so', 'high', 'up', 'hills', 'couldnt', 'even', 'get', 'phone', 'line', 'installed.W.A.P.A.', 'local', 'water', 'power', 'authority', 'had', 'lot', 'problems', 'back', 'then.We', 'had', 'blackouts', 'time.Just', 'was', 'recovering', 'mental', 'physical', 'beating', 'Dark', 'had', 'given', 'power', 'out.This', 'movie', 'took', 'something', 'was', 'mundane', 'harmless', 'made', 'really', 'pretty', 'freaky.The', 'power', 'didnt', 'come', 'back', 'till', '4', 'a.m', 'did', 'manage', 'sleep', 'only', 'back', 'wall.Later', 'when', 'mom', 'asked', 'why', 'had', 'flashlight', 'taped', 'speargun', 'could', 'only', 'smile', 'say', 'was', 'just', 'idea.I', 'still', 'watch', 'movie', 'time', 'time', 'do', 'manage', 'sleep', 'lights', 'out.But', 'then', 'easier', 'what', 'M-4', 'surefire', 'light', 'attached', 'just', 'know', ""'re"", 'there', 'post', 'script', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'have', 'written', 'review', 'previously.But', 'someone', 'neurotic', 'reason', 'felt', 'somehow', 'offened', 'opinion', 'complained', 'Amazon.So', 'due', 'persons', 'shallow', 'sensibilities', 'have', 'rewrite', 'review', 'really', 'cool', 'little', 'movie']",Don't Be Afraid of the Dark VHS

Well the scariness wore off over the last 38 years.A neurotic housewife named Sally and her business exec husband move into Sally's family house, a spooky two story Victorian mansion. When Sally starts the redecorating along with her pompous decorator she comes across a locked room in the house. After arguing with the handyman who insists she should leave the room locked, she finally gets the key. But once she opens her father's old study and has the bricks from the fireplace removed, strange things begin to happen. Sally begins to see small creatures everywhere, but no one will believe her. Her husband dismisses her as neurotic and her friend thinks Sally may be losing her mind. But things take a deadly serious turn when the decorator trips at the top of the stairs and falls to his death. Sally sees a rope lying across the place where he tripped, but when she picks it up to take it, a horrifying little creature pulls it from her grasp. Is she crazy? Or has Sally released demons in the house, demons her father summoned?These little puppets are terrorizing Kim Darby as she moves in to an old house left to her by her grandmother. These puppets have been locked away in a sealed fire place by Uncle Charlie from My Three sons.(William Demerest) Kim lets them out and the terrorizing begins. The puppets aren't scary.

497353,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00000F39T,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[12, 14]","The Farnhams, a young couple, move into a suspicious looking but beautiful house in California owned by the wife's father.  Nobody has satisfactorily explained how Sally's father died in the old house.  Only handyman Harris (William Demarest, AKA ""Uncle Charlie"") appears to know the truth - and he's not talking.  (Demarest never looks happy, but he conveys a persistent attitude that things would be better for everybody if the Farnham's just moved out and sealed up the place).  Instead, Sally (Kim Darby who's made to appear prematurely frumpy) tries to unseals a mysteriously bricked-up fireplace in a darkened room deep within the house.  Opening up the ashbox, she does not realize that the sealed fireplace is really a prison, not for the cast of ""My Three Sons"" but for a race of homicidal imps.  They know who Sally is, and they've got plans for her.  But first they'll have some fun.  Soon learning that she's released something, something that can't stand light (whether because the creatures are too evil, or simply because they've been stuck in that darkened fireplace for too long), Sally refuses to stay in the dark.  Her upwardly mobile husband has no plans to leave the house (and walk away from equity?), and isn't about to listen to any stories of killer dwarves.  The imps put in appearances in the obligatory embarassing moments - like a doomed dinner party - but soon decide to dispatch their prey.  Sally has the light on her side, but this is a film with a dark bent, and Sally is pretty much outclassed.This is one of those paradoxic movies of our 1970's youth - made for TV but more memorable than most feature films.  Whether it's ""Trilogy of Terror"", ""Gargoyles"", ""Salem's Lot"" or this flick, we've watched them wondering the same thing:  how did this flick make it to TV.  And more importantly, how does a TV flick which looks like a TV flick (down to the house, which was probably used countless times on Aaron Spelling shows and in other TV movies) manage to sustain such suspense?  Who cares - this is simply one more underappreciated classic that hasn't been seen on screen for years (basic cable is too busy repetedly running ""I know what you did"" movies).  The direction is perfect, showing us exactly what we need to see about the creatures, no more and no less.  The script is perfect also, actually benefiting from holes in the plot (like, why doesn't Demarest just tell Sally what happened - even if she can't believe in the imps, she can't ignore the fact of her father's strange death and the other weird stuff).  The connection between the creatures, their obsession for Sally and the house itself are perfectly kept obscure, leading up to a pulse pounding climax that Hollywood can't touch.  Supposedly, this flick is being remade for a 2004 release.  I'm expecting the full Hollywood treatment -CGI effects covering up an uninspired script - so stick with this version.",4,How did this ever get to TV,1030492800,"08 28, 2002",2002,2914,"['Farnhams', 'young', 'couple', 'move', 'suspicious', 'looking', 'beautiful', 'house', 'California', 'owned', 'wife', 'father', 'Nobody', 'satisfactorily', 'explained', 'how', 'Sally', 'father', 'died', 'old', 'house', 'Only', 'handyman', 'Harris', 'William', 'Demarest', 'AKA', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'know', 'truth', 'not', 'talking', 'Demarest', 'never', 'happy', 'persistent', 'attitude', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'everybody', 'Farnham', 'just', 'moved', 'out', 'sealed', 'up', 'place', 'Instead', 'Sally', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'who', 'made', 'appear', 'prematurely', 'frumpy', 'unseals', 'mysteriously', 'bricked-up', 'fireplace', 'darkened', 'room', 'deep', 'house', 'Opening', 'up', 'ashbox', 'not', 'realize', 'sealed', 'fireplace', 'really', 'prison', 'not', 'cast', 'Three', 'Sons', 'race', 'homicidal', 'imps', 'know', 'who', 'Sally', ""'ve"", 'got', 'plans', 'first', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun', 'Soon', 'learning', 'released', 'something', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'light', 'creatures', 'are', 'too', 'evil', 'simply', ""'ve"", 'been', 'stuck', 'darkened', 'fireplace', 'too', 'long', 'Sally', 'stay', 'dark', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'husband', 'plans', 'leave', 'house', 'walk', 'away', 'equity', ""n't"", 'about', 'listen', 'stories', 'killer', 'dwarves', 'imps', 'put', 'appearances', 'obligatory', 'embarassing', 'moments', 'doomed', 'dinner', 'party', 'soon', 'decide', 'dispatch', 'prey', 'Sally', 'light', 'side', 'film', 'dark', 'bent', 'Sally', 'pretty', 'much', 'outclassed.This', 'one', 'paradoxic', 'movies', '1970', 'youth', 'made', 'TV', 'more', 'memorable', 'most', 'feature', 'films', 'Trilogy', 'Terror', 'Gargoyles', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'wondering', 'same', 'thing', 'how', 'did', 'flick', 'make', 'TV', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'TV', 'flick', 'TV', 'flick', 'house', 'was', 'probably', 'used', 'countless', 'times', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'shows', 'other', 'TV', 'movies', 'manage', 'sustain', 'such', 'suspense', 'Who', 'simply', 'one', 'more', 'underappreciated', 'classic', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'screen', 'years', 'basic', 'cable', 'too', 'busy', 'repetedly', 'running', 'know', 'what', 'did', 'movies', 'direction', 'perfect', 'showing', 'exactly', 'what', 'need', 'see', 'creatures', 'more', 'less', 'script', 'perfect', 'also', 'actually', 'benefiting', 'holes', 'plot', 'why', ""n't"", 'Demarest', 'just', 'tell', 'Sally', 'what', 'happened', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'imps', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'fact', 'father', 'strange', 'death', 'other', 'weird', 'stuff', 'connection', 'creatures', 'obsession', 'Sally', 'house', 'are', 'perfectly', 'kept', 'obscure', 'leading', 'up', 'pulse', 'pounding', 'climax', 'Hollywood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'touch', 'Supposedly', 'flick', 'being', 'remade', '2004', 'release', ""'m"", 'expecting', 'full', 'Hollywood', 'treatment', '-CGI', 'effects', 'covering', 'up', 'uninspired', 'script', 'so', 'stick', 'version']",Don't Be Afraid of the Dark VHS

Boone ""TheatreX""","[7, 7]","Considering some of the OTHER stuff that Warner Brothers has given real DVD releases to, I can't beleive that this is only available as a Warner Archive DVD-r.  I guess maybe they don't realize how many people saw this back in the 70's and that the film has stuck with them all this time.  The DVD is a little on the dark side, and while I think another reviewer said that it was ""LOADED"" with scratches, I think that's a bit of an exaggeration.  There are a couple here and there, nothing particularly distracting.Of course,  the story (if you don't know it) is that of a young couple that move to an big old inherited monster of a house.  The woman (Kim Darby) wants her grandfather's old study for ""her spot"", but is rather upset the fireplace has been bricked up.  And that the ash door is bolted shut.  Their handyman/carpenter, William Demarest, was hired to do all that years ago by grandma, and urges Darby to leave it alone and this room too, but of course you know she doesn't, and unwittingly sets free some little creatures that want her for their very own.I may have seen this when it was first aired, because in the days before cable and video and all that, one did what one had to, to catch the weird or scary stuff in TV.  For a made-for-TV movie, it had quite an impact, and you can tell from the number of people that have reviewed it and remember it.  Which is what kind of upsets me that it wasn't given a PROPER DVD release.Still though, my old VCR is not working so well these days, and my big box USA VHS tape of this film is kind of collecting dust, so it is nice to have this on DVD, even if only a DVD-r with no extras.

I watched it. And again, it scared the hell outta me. Let's hope it will be released on DVD so I can buy it, watch it, and be scared to hell yet again!There are 2 things I love about this film.The first is that the ""creatures"" are shown very rarely, and when they do appear, it's done to startle you. You never really get a long enough look at them to see what they are or how good the make-up effects are, BUT they scare you evertime. There's also a spiritual thing about them, like they're ghosts of some sort. Only Sally sees and hears them calling her name (which also creeped me out-nothing like going to bed and hearing your name being whispered).Secondly, I love the fact that the antagonist (the creatures/ghosts in this case) wins in the end. In most horror films the antagonist loses, gets killed, or is sent back to where it came from. And there's usually a sequel. Guess what? In this film the antagonist lives, the protagonist dies, and there is no sequel.Enjoy. It's creepy as all hell. Don't turn out the lights whatever you do.If you like this film, I suggest watching ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"". Another 70's classic horror/suspence film.",4,Afraid of the Dark?

Sorry he wasn't hot enough for you, he died of cancer not too many years after this was shot, so maybe he wasn't  feeling so hot !Really turned my stomach, so i stopped listening.",4,Be careful what you wish for!,1337558400,"05 21, 2012",2012,1708,"['Warning', 'Spoilers', 'What', 'delight', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'only', '3', 'yrs', 'old', 'when', 'appeared', 'tv', 'i', 'missed', 'i', 'am', 'glad', 'i', 'caught', 'up', '40', 'Can', 'really', 'see', 'how', 'back', 'then', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'freaked', 'people', 'out', 'watching', 'now', 'having', 'seen', 'bunch', 'horror', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'scare', 'did', 'hold', 'attention', '70', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'America', 'was', 'love', 'anything', 'everything', 'relating', 'occult', 'movie', 'was', 'right', 'line', 'what', 'viewers', 'wanted', 'Sally', 'main', 'character', 'perfect', 'brought', 'about', 'unique', 'emotion', 'one', 'i', 'have', 'never', 'felt', 'victim', 'character', 'being', 'i', 'actually', 'was', 'rooting', 'demons', 'get', 'was', 'such', 'miserable', 'whining', 'character', 'sad', 'lonely', 'life', 'whole', 'time', 'i', 'was', 'thinking', 'speed', 'plow', 'fellas', 'let', 'get', 'show', 'road', 'can', 'get', 'Sally', 'down', 'there', 'shut', 'up', 'course', 'end', 'did', 'get', 'bless', 'hearts', 'old', 'saying', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'just', 'might', 'get', 'did', 'ever', 'right', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'whining', 'voice', 'prevailed', 'WOW', 'eternity', 'Sally', 'hell', 'Re', 'CommentaryWent', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'commentary', 'looking', 'forward', 'fun', 'filled', 'romp', 'three', 'guys', 'watching', 'film', 'well', 'two', 'guys', 'kept', 'ripping', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'looks', 'how', 'was', ""n't"", 'attractive', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'husband', 'how', 'men', 'back', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'good', 'looking', 'etc', 'etc', 'REALLY', 'guys', 'Sorry', 'was', ""n't"", 'hot', 'enough', 'died', 'cancer', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'shot', 'so', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'so', 'hot', 'Really', 'turned', 'stomach', 'i', 'stopped', 'listening']",Don't Be Afraid of the Dark VHS

I made the 'mistake' (in the not-being-able-to-sleep plus being afraid to go down in my basement) of watching it when i was around 5, and it made such an impression on me (notably, the little green gremlin-like creatures) that at the age of 40, i popped for a copy of this on DVD to relive my childhood freakout, when i saw it was available.  I was not disappointed - this is a pretty good made-for-TV film, and achieves a bit of suspense as Sally tries to convince everyone that she's not crazy and is not hallucinating seeing the creatures.  There are a couple of minor plot holes (which i won't get into here, at the risk of spoiling stuff from the film) but overall, if you're into 70's horror, this is a pretty good film, if a bit tame by today's standards.  The creatures are pretty cool looking.  This film would probably be a good candidate for a remake today, with better effects and a bit of a more macabre director's vision.This is part of the Warner Archives series - made-to-order DVD's in DVD-R form.  There are really no extras (other than plugs for other titles in the WB Archives), and the movie chapter stops are in 10 minute increments (not necessarily by scenes) but the transfer itself is actually relatively clean (couple of scratches/etc) and exceeded my expectations, as i hadn't bought any titles in the WB Archives prior to this one.",3,Pretty good made-for-TV horror movie from the 70's,1261612800,"12 24, 2009",2009,1435,"['remember', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', '70', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'kid', 'made', ""'mistake"", 'not-being-able-to-sleep', 'being', 'afraid', 'go', 'down', 'basement', 'watching', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'around', '5', 'made', 'such', 'impression', 'notably', 'little', 'green', 'gremlin-like', 'creatures', 'age', '40', 'i', 'popped', 'copy', 'DVD', 'relive', 'childhood', 'freakout', 'when', 'i', 'saw', 'was', 'available', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'pretty', 'good', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'bit', 'suspense', 'Sally', 'convince', 'everyone', 'not', 'crazy', 'not', 'hallucinating', 'seeing', 'creatures', 'are', 'couple', 'minor', 'plot', 'holes', 'i', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'here', 'risk', 'spoiling', 'stuff', 'film', 'overall', ""'re"", '70', 'horror', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'bit', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'creatures', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'looking', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'good', 'candidate', 'remake', 'today', 'better', 'effects', 'bit', 'more', 'macabre', 'director', 'vision.This', 'part', 'Warner', 'Archives', 'series', 'made-to-order', 'DVD', 'DVD-R', 'form', 'are', 'really', 'extras', 'other', 'plugs', 'other', 'titles', 'WB', 'Archives', 'movie', 'chapter', 'stops', 'are', '10', 'minute', 'increments', 'not', 'necessarily', 'scenes', 'transfer', 'actually', 'relatively', 'clean', 'couple', 'scratches/etc', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'i', 'had', ""n't"", 'bought', 'titles', 'WB', 'Archives', 'prior', 'one']",Don't Be Afraid of the Dark VHS
497365,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00000F39T,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","Made for tv in 1973, DON&#8217;T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is a chilling tale of terror about a woman named Sally Farnham (Kim Darby). Sally and her husband Alex (Jim Hutton) move into an old mansion inherited from Sally&#8217;s recently deceased grandmother. Sally is in the process of redecorating the house, but there is a mysterious room in the basement that is locked. Sally discovers the key hidden away upstairs and unlocks the room. She discovers a very dark and secluded room that apparently used to be a study. The room includes a fireplace that is completely bricked up and a small side door for cleaning that is bolted shut. Sally requests that the handyman, Mr. Harris (William Demarest), who worked on the house while Sally&#8217;s grandmother was alive, begin un-bricking the fireplace. Mr. Harris refuses, stating that there are things that are better off left alone and that he couldn&#8217;t do it even if he wanted to because the fireplace is bricked six-feet deep with steel bars and concrete. After Mr. Harris leaves, Sally unbolts the side door and instead of a fireplace discovers a large, walled off horizontal shaft that descends into the subbasement. Shortly after, Sally begins hearing voices that call her name and she begins to see strange events happening at the corner of her eye, such as an ash tray falling off her night stand. It soon becomes clear that Sally is either going insane or she has unleashed something terrible from the fireplace.For a tv movie made in 1973, DON&#8217;T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK holds up incredibly well. Although the movie is a horror movie, it was made for the television and follows the codes of the time. These standards actually enhance the terror of what is seen. For instance, most of the violence occurs off screen and can only be heard and imagined. The imagination is far more powerful than anything that can be shown on screen. Darby gives a fine and nuanced performance as Sally and William Demarest as the handyman, Mr. Harris does well illustrating a man who knows far more than he will ever acknowledge. Jim Hutton&#8217;s portrayal of Alex is a bit stilted and lackluster until the film&#8217;s third act, but that has more to do with the way the character is written instead of Hutton&#8217;s acting.Overall, DON&#8217;T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is an often-overlooked horror movie gem that despite being made for tv and having a low budget remains a chilling and creepy horror film. Modern audiences who enjoy torture porn might find DON&#8217;T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK cheesy, but students of film and those who like classic horror will find plenty to enjoy.",4,Let the Light Shine In,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,2628,"['Made', 'tv', '1973', 'DON', '8217', 'T', 'BE', 'AFRAID', 'THE', 'DARK', 'chilling', 'tale', 'terror', 'woman', 'named', 'Sally', 'Farnham', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'Sally', 'husband', 'Alex', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'move', 'old', 'mansion', 'inherited', 'Sally', '8217', 'recently', 'deceased', 'grandmother', 'Sally', 'process', 'redecorating', 'house', 'mysterious', 'room', 'basement', 'locked', 'Sally', 'key', 'hidden', 'away', 'upstairs', 'room', 'very', 'dark', 'secluded', 'room', 'apparently', 'used', 'be', 'study', 'room', 'fireplace', 'completely', 'bricked', 'up', 'small', 'side', 'door', 'cleaning', 'bolted', 'shut', 'Sally', 'handyman', 'Mr.', 'Harris', 'William', 'Demarest', 'who', 'worked', 'house', 'Sally', '8217', 'grandmother', 'was', 'alive', 'begin', 'un-bricking', 'fireplace', 'Mr.', 'Harris', 'stating', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'left', 'alone', '8217', 'do', 'even', 'wanted', 'fireplace', 'bricked', 'six-feet', 'deep', 'steel', 'bars', 'concrete', 'Mr.', 'Harris', 'Sally', 'side', 'door', 'instead', 'fireplace', 'large', 'walled', 'off', 'horizontal', 'shaft', 'subbasement', 'Shortly', 'Sally', 'hearing', 'voices', 'call', 'name', 'see', 'strange', 'events', 'happening', 'corner', 'eye', 'such', 'ash', 'tray', 'falling', 'off', 'night', 'stand', 'soon', 'clear', 'Sally', 'either', 'going', 'insane', 'unleashed', 'something', 'terrible', 'fireplace.For', 'tv', 'movie', 'made', '1973', 'DON', '8217', 'T', 'BE', 'AFRAID', 'THE', 'DARK', 'up', 'incredibly', 'well', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'codes', 'time', 'standards', 'actually', 'enhance', 'terror', 'what', 'seen', 'instance', 'most', 'violence', 'screen', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'heard', 'imagined', 'imagination', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'shown', 'screen', 'Darby', 'fine', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Sally', 'William', 'Demarest', 'handyman', 'Mr.', 'Harris', 'well', 'illustrating', 'man', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'will', 'ever', 'acknowledge', 'Jim', 'Hutton', '8217', 'portrayal', 'Alex', 'bit', 'stilted', 'lackluster', 'film', '8217', 's', 'third', 'act', 'more', 'do', 'way', 'character', 'written', 'instead', 'Hutton', '8217', 'acting.Overall', 'DON', '8217', 'T', 'BE', 'AFRAID', 'THE', 'DARK', 'often-overlooked', 'horror', 'movie', 'gem', 'being', 'made', 'tv', 'having', 'low', 'budget', 'chilling', 'creepy', 'horror', 'film', 'Modern', 'audiences', 'who', 'enjoy', 'torture', 'porn', 'might', 'find', 'DON', '8217', 'T', 'BE', 'AFRAID', 'THE', 'DARK', 'cheesy', 'students', 'film', 'who', 'like', 'classic', 'horror', 'will', 'find', 'plenty', 'enjoy']",Don't Be Afraid of the Dark VHS
