For those who insist on old-fashioned entertainment it is sure to please. However, a tritely written script doesn't help the proceedings no matter how much it may dwell upon love. Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs and score greatly improve the journey after a consequentially slow start. The results are mixed, but the best songs, particularly ""June Is Bustin' out All Over"" and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" give some badly needed zest even though the screenplay repeats itself or ineffectively borrows from elements of 'Our Town' and 'It's a Wonderful Life'. A comparison to Oscar and Hammerstein's best musicals, including 'Oklahoma' and 'The Sound of Music' will reveal this musical to be an inconsistent carnival ride to be sure.(*Based on information from Wikepedia.)",3,Up and Down Ride,1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,874,"['Allegedly', 'innovative', 'time', 'tragic', 'elements', 'overture', 'herald', 'musical*', 'who', 'insist', 'old-fashioned', 'entertainment', 'sure', 'please', 'However', 'tritely', 'written', 'script', ""n't"", 'help', 'proceedings', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'may', 'dwell', 'love', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'songs', 'score', 'greatly', 'improve', 'journey', 'consequentially', 'slow', 'start', 'results', 'are', 'mixed', 'best', 'songs', 'particularly', 'June', 'Is', 'Bustin', 'out', ""'ll"", 'Never', 'Walk', 'Alone', 'give', 'badly', 'needed', 'zest', 'even', 'screenplay', 'ineffectively', 'borrows', 'elements', ""'Our"", 'Town', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'comparison', 'Oscar', 'Hammerstein', 'best', 'musicals', 'including', ""'Oklahoma"", 'Sound', 'Music', 'will', 'reveal', 'musical', 'be', 'inconsistent', 'carnival', 'ride', 'be', 'sure', '*Based', 'information', 'Wikepedia']",N/A

Considered by Rodgers as the personal favourite of all his works, and based on the play ""Liliom"" by Ferenc Molnar; the story concerns innocent factory-girl Julie Jordan (Shirley Jones) and jaded carnival barker Billy Bigelow (Gordon MacRae).  Despite coming from the opposite sides of the track, the two fall in love, but their relationship is tempered by Billy's violent outbursts and inability to find an honest job.  When Julie becomes pregnant, he is talked into committing a robbery, but the plan backfires when he falls on his own knife and dies while trying to escape the police.  Now in Heaven, Billy is given one last chance to redeem himself and to reconcile his now-teenaged daughter.  Filled with haunting songs like ""If I Loved You"" and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"", CAROUSEL remains a very moving film experience.This DVD has been available for a while in the UK and Australia, and will finally get a US release this November.  Extra features will include audio commentary from Shirley Jones and Nick Redman; an all-new featurette ""Turns on the Carousel"", vintage performances from the ""General Foods"" Rodgers & Hammerstein TV tribute (original Broadway leads John Raitt and Jan Clayton performing the complete Bench Scene/""If I Loved You"").

Jones ""Howard Jones""","[1, 1]","Originally a play called ""Liliom"" by the Hungarian playwright and novelist Ferenc Molnar, this was the second collaboration by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, a successor to their show Oklahoma. The Broadway show dates from 1945 and the film from 1956. It tells the story of the romance between a cotton mill worker (Shirley Jones) and a carousel barker (Gordon Macrae) who works at a fairground. It was filmed in CinemaScope and Eastmancolor and contains another crop of fresh tunes, some of which have become ""evergreens"": `You'll never walk alone', `If I loved you', `June is bustin' out all over', and the Carousel waltz that opens the show. Waltzes were a speciality amongst Rodgers' many compositions with both Hart and Hammerstein. The film is a little wistful in that our hero, Billy Bigelow, the barker, dies in an attempted robbery, but he is allowed back to earth for a while to see how his daughter has grown up, which also gives him a chance to repent for his sins. The original story is not one that lends itself to adaptation as a happy-go-lucky musical and other reviewers are right to question the whole morality of the piece. However, I'm sure the storyline made for good dramatic theatre. The music is sumptuously orchestrated and played by the studio orchestra conducted by Alfred Newman, who has very many film scores to his credit.

457874,A3M3FG82ZE1J8I,6305282854,"Ed N ""Ed""","[16, 18]","Until about a month ago, I knew almost nothing about this musical, Carousel.  I only had a vague awareness of one tune (&quot;If I Loved You&quot;).  However, I came across an LP (yes!) of the film soundtrack  and, on a whim, decided to buy it (what the heck, it was only 10 cents).  After listening to the entire LP, I was thoroughly astounded.  I happen to  love Hollywood musicals, yet here was a new one for me.  Shirley Jones and  Gordon McRae sounded fantastic on the soundtrack, and I quickly purchased  the DVD of Carousel.  Needless to say, it is one of my most pleasing DVD  purchases.  For those who do not know, Carousel is Roger and Hammerstein's  second Broadway musical, after Oklahoma, from the mid-1940s and was made  into a film in the mid-1950s. It was supposedly filmed in cinemascope 55  (actually 35) and reunited Jones and McRae, who had starred together in the  film version of Oklahoma.The film was a flop when it was released,  unfortunately.  The reasons are multifold.  First, the film cut out a few  of the songs from the musical and cut out parts of other songs. These songs  are present in full length on the soundtrack.  Personally, this did not  bother me, as I felt the cut songs are a little weaker than the rest, and  the partially cut songs only had the intros cut, which wasn't a big deal  for me.  But it probably disturbed the purists during the film's initial  release.  Secondly, the musical, beautiful as it might be, is a bit of a  downer at the end, which might have turned some audiences off.  By the time  West Side Story made it to the big screen, audiences' tastes had changed  sufficiently but not yet at Carousel's initial release.  Thirdly, the  storyline is changed somewhat in the movie from the Broadway version; it  starts at the end and is told mostly in flashback.  I feel this was  probably a bad decision on the screenwriters but was probably their way of  compensating for the melancholy ending.  At any rate, on my DVD, I just  skip the first seven minutes and watch the film from there, so no problem.  Lastly, some of the original choreography from the play was changed in the  film; it was retained for the Louise's Ballet near the end but changed  elsewhere.  Again, this did not bother me, but then again, I haven't seen  the theater version, so I cannot judge for sure.  However, the choreography  for Louise's Ballet was quite beautiful.Anyways, the story deals with  the bittersweet love between a young Maine girl and a carousel barker and  the consequences that befall them after they run off to get married and  return to the girl's coastal town.  Along the way, we get to hear some  truly breath-taking singing by Shirley Jones and Gordon McRae, especially  in &quot;If I Loved You,&quot; McRae's &quot;Soliloquy,&quot; and  &quot;What's the Use of Wond'rin.&quot;  I've rarely heard better singing  in a musical.  And the rest of the singing cast is superb as well,  especially in the songs &quot;When the Children are Asleep&quot; and  &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone.&quot;The DVD has been THX-remastered and  it sounds quite heavenly (however, you need to change audio to hear it, as  the DVD will by default start with the original 2-channel soundtrack).  The  picture quality is good enough (not superb, since there are some blemishes  and the film's age shows here and there), but overall, the film looks  great.  Plus, we get to see some of the astounding cinematography of the  cinemascope process that usually gets chopped when seen on TV.I'm glad I  finally saw this musical.  For whatever faults the film version may  possess, I think the music and the dancing and the poignancy of the  storyline make this truly a worthwhile film to see.  It is at any rate  better than South Pacific or King and I or State Fair.For lovers of  musicals, I highly recommend Carousel!",4,One of Roger and Hammerstein's most under-rated musicals,963360000,"07 12, 2000",2000,3850,"['month', 'ago', 'knew', 'almost', 'nothing', 'musical', 'Carousel', 'only', 'had', 'vague', 'awareness', 'one', 'tune', 'quot', 'Loved', 'quot', 'However', 'came', 'LP', 'yes', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'whim', 'decided', 'buy', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'only', '10', 'cents', 'listening', 'entire', 'LP', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'astounded', 'happen', 'love', 'Hollywood', 'musicals', 'yet', 'here', 'was', 'new', 'one', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Gordon', 'McRae', 'sounded', 'fantastic', 'soundtrack', 'quickly', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'Carousel', 'Needless', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'pleasing', 'DVD', 'purchases', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Carousel', 'Roger', 'Hammerstein', 'second', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'Oklahoma', 'mid-1940s', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'mid-1950s', 'was', 'supposedly', 'filmed', 'cinemascope', '55', 'actually', '35', 'reunited', 'Jones', 'McRae', 'who', 'had', 'starred', 'together', 'film', 'version', 'Oklahoma.The', 'film', 'was', 'flop', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'unfortunately', 'reasons', 'are', 'multifold', 'First', 'film', 'cut', 'out', 'few', 'songs', 'musical', 'cut', 'out', 'parts', 'other', 'songs', 'songs', 'are', 'present', 'full', 'length', 'soundtrack', 'Personally', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'felt', 'cut', 'songs', 'are', 'little', 'weaker', 'rest', 'partially', 'cut', 'songs', 'only', 'had', 'intros', 'cut', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'probably', 'disturbed', 'purists', 'film', 'initial', 'release', 'Secondly', 'musical', 'beautiful', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'downer', 'end', 'might', 'have', 'turned', 'audiences', 'off', 'time', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'made', 'big', 'screen', 'audiences', 'tastes', 'had', 'changed', 'sufficiently', 'not', 'yet', 'Carousel', 'initial', 'release', 'Thirdly', 'storyline', 'changed', 'somewhat', 'movie', 'Broadway', 'version', 'end', 'told', 'mostly', 'flashback', 'feel', 'was', 'probably', 'bad', 'decision', 'screenwriters', 'was', 'probably', 'way', 'compensating', 'melancholy', 'ending', 'rate', 'DVD', 'just', 'skip', 'first', 'seven', 'minutes', 'watch', 'film', 'there', 'problem', 'Lastly', 'original', 'choreography', 'play', 'was', 'changed', 'film', 'was', 'retained', 'Louise', 'Ballet', 'end', 'changed', 'elsewhere', 'Again', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'then', 'again', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'theater', 'version', 'can', 'not', 'judge', 'sure', 'However', 'choreography', 'Louise', 'Ballet', 'was', 'quite', 'beautiful.Anyways', 'story', 'deals', 'bittersweet', 'love', 'young', 'Maine', 'girl', 'carousel', 'barker', 'consequences', 'befall', 'run', 'off', 'get', 'married', 'return', 'girl', 'coastal', 'town', 'way', 'get', 'hear', 'truly', 'breath-taking', 'singing', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Gordon', 'McRae', 'especially', 'quot', 'Loved', 'quot', 'McRae', 'quot', 'Soliloquy', 'quot', 'quot', 'What', 'Use', ""Wond'rin."", 'quot', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'heard', 'better', 'singing', 'musical', 'rest', 'singing', 'cast', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'songs', 'quot', 'When', 'Children', 'are', 'Asleep', 'quot', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'Never', 'Walk', 'Alone.', 'quot', 'DVD', 'been', 'THX-remastered', 'quite', 'heavenly', 'however', 'need', 'change', 'audio', 'hear', 'DVD', 'will', 'default', 'start', 'original', '2-channel', 'soundtrack', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'enough', 'not', 'superb', 'are', 'blemishes', 'film', 'age', 'here', 'there', 'overall', 'film', 'great', 'get', 'see', 'astounding', 'cinematography', 'cinemascope', 'process', 'usually', 'chopped', 'when', 'seen', 'TV.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'saw', 'musical', 'faults', 'film', 'version', 'may', 'possess', 'think', 'music', 'dancing', 'poignancy', 'storyline', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'see', 'rate', 'better', 'South', 'Pacific', 'King', 'State', 'Fair.For', 'lovers', 'musicals', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Carousel']",N/A

But I must caution the investor of the this Box Set.THE GOOD NEWS: These are the greatest Rodgers & Hammerstien II musicals now in a Box set.  They have all been digitally remastered both picture & sound.  The colors, picture quality excellent and the sound crystal clear.  THE BAD NEWS:  All this work but  ""State Fair"" is lost in the WideScreen aspect ratio presentation.Qualifying Statement:  I am a Home Theatre, HDTV - 55"" x 16:9  WidesScreen, Progressive Scan DVD, Dolby Prologic Sound System owner.  I have over 400 DVD movies ,mostly remastered, WideScreen (preserved in the original theatrical aspect ratio), Anamorphic or enhanced for 16:9 TV's.NOTE: Full Screen - 4:3 (1:33 to 1 ratio) made for TV or film before 1953.  WideScreen - 4:3 letterbox (horizontal top & bottom black bars adjusted for any aspect ratio 165/185/225 to 1 etc. It is still letterbox) are movies made after 1953. (to compete with the popularity of Television)  ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN IS THE ONLY TRUE HDTV 16:9 PRESENTATION.  This format automatically adjusts to the Television being used.  To get the High Definition picture the DVD MUST BE ANAMORPHIC & ENHANCED FOR 16:9 TELEVISIONS!!!!!!Now in SUMMARY:  STATE FAIR Full Screen Technicolor is the best presentation and the movie.  Oklahoma, Carousal, The King & I and South Pacific are WideScreen (4:3 Letterbox - small picture horizontal & vertical black bars) great color, music but small picture very disappointing.  Finally the Sound of Music was adjusted to an Anamorphic WideScreen but was not enhanced for the HDTV 16:9 format.  The results is a very grainy picture.Bottomline - Now that the Home Theatre environment is becoming more common it is time to sort the GOOD from the BAD DVD's. This is only from a dedicated videophile of old classic movies who enjoys the total viewing & listening Home Theatre experience.  The movies themselves are the main ingredient but unfortunately Film Studios don't always give us what we think we are getting.  (Quality vs Quantity)  Another words they are already re-releasing DVD movies with these mentioned enhancements & special features for WideScreen TV's etc  SO WE NEED TO BUY RIGHT THE FIRST TIME & not repeat buying on the same movie as we upgrade our Televisions & Home Theatres.  REMEMBER - ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN & ENHANCED FOR 16:9 TELEVISIONS adjusts automatically to any size aspect ratio television!!!!!

After watching it again on this wonderful DVD I understand the mixed reactions.  This is a beautiful story, beautifully told with beautiful music but it is dark.  Boy is it ever dark!  American movie audiences weren't ready for this sort of thing in the `50s but that was their loss.Despite the movie's Bowdlerization of the story --  Billy Bigelow dies accidentally rather than by his own hand, as the original Broadway show had it - it's still wonderful.  It's easy to forget what great voices both Shirley Jones (Julie Jordan) and Gordon McRae (Billy Bigelow) had.  McRae's rendering of Soliloquy was both beautiful and deeply movie, and Jones' combination of youth, beauty, and singing talent couldn't have been more appealing.Equally appealing is the ballet, featuring Susan Luckey as young Louise Bigelow and Jacques D'Amboise as her carnival dancing partner.  The choreography was based on the great Agnes De Mille's choreography for the original Broadway procuction.The film's original 2.55:1 formatting and multi-channel soundtrack have been retained.

The 1956 film version showcases the best performance, before or since, that this magnificent score has ever received.  Beautifully photographed on location in CinemaScope and Technicolor, the poignant and tragic love story of barker Billy Bigelow and factory worker Julie Jordan unfolds with compassion and conviction. Gordon McRae gives the performance of a lifetime as Billy and his stunning rendition of the seven-minute &quot;SOLILIQUY&quot; is one of the greatest vocal performances of the 20th Century. Shirley Jones, ravishingly young and beautiful in only her second film appearance, is equally effective as Julie, a naive inexperienced young woman who finds in tragedy an inner strength she never knew existed within her.CAROUSEL's greatest strength is, however, the great songs, which are woven seamlessly into the story. What else can you say about a score that includes such standards as &quot;YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE' and 'IF I LOVED YOU&quot;?  In the capable hands of the legendary composer/arranger/conductor Alfred Newman, Richard Rodgers' soaring melodies are taken to heights of brilliance undreamed of in the Broadway original.  This is especially evident in &quot;Louise's Ballet.&quot;  Ken Darby's excellent choral arrangements and wonderful vocals by MacRae, Jones, Claramae Turner, Barbara Ruick, Robert Rounseville and Cameron Mitchell all add up to the most perfect performance of this musical ever.See this movie with someone you love and bring extra handkerchiefs. Also prepare to be dazzled with the glorious New England scenery rendered flawlessly on this superbly produced DVD and Rodgers and Hammerstein's greatest score in genuine 6 channel discrete stereo.CAROUSEL is the kind of movie they just don't make any more.

457890,A35NQ8A4NN870A,6305282854,Jaime Costa,"[1, 10]","I confess that I was never fond of Rodgers & Hammerstein's film versions. I purchased the Rodgers & Hammerstein Collection only for the music, because I saw the films when they were released, and though I was a real fan of musicals (the Kelly and Donen and Minnelli ones) I hated CAROUSEL, THE KING AND I and SOUTH PACIFIC. Later I saw OKLAHOMA (not in Todd-AO, because in my country Uruguay was released only in the CinemaScope print) with several songs deleted, and I was not very fond of it either. And I never wanted to see THE SOUND OF MUSIC, probably because I had seen DIE TRAPP FAMILY already, an awful german film (corny, schmalzy and sugary), and I thought the Robert Wise version would made me the same impression, which I confirmed later, when I saw it with my kids. So, why should I buy THE RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN COLLECTION? Well, in the first place because I'm buying all the musicals that I can get, and second, because the films were remastered, with the two versions of STATE FAIR (the first one good, the remake awful), the rare Fritz Lang's french version of LILIOM and the opportunity to find out, once and for all, why THE SOUND OF MUSIC is the most loved family film of all times. And I must recognize that I couldn't find the reason. The film is better than I remembered, and Julie Andrews certainly steals the show, but that's all. I can stand OKLAHOMA (except for the unbearable Gloria Grahame) because the music is glorious. And the same goes for SOUTH PACIFIC (with an impossible Rossano Brazzi, dubbed and a lousy actor), but THE KING AND I is simply unpleasant. Deborah Kerr (dubbed in the songs by Marni Nixon) is a good actress, but why she tries all the time to be adorable when she is simply mellifluous and corny? And Yul Brynner (who stole the Oscar in 1956 from Laurence Olivier in RICHARD III, Rock Hudson and James Dean in GIANT and Kirk Douglas in LUST FOR LIFE) is always overacting, ignoring that a cinematic performance shouldn't be a stage recreation. I can't stand him. I never could. So, the films are all watchable (the prints are really good), the extras are always interesting and the music is, most of the times, worth listening. The films (all of them) are second rate, dated, overlong, boring and the best way to demonstrate WHICH IS THE WORST WAY TO ADAPT A STAGE PLAY TO THE SCREEN. Gene Kelly, Vincente Minnelli, Stanley Donen, Charles Walters, George Sidney and George Cukor, among others, knew it.

457910,A120V3RVSK1O1K,6305282854,K. Ostrowski,"[1, 5]","This review contains a few spoilers.  I'm also reviewing this from the perspective of the decade in which it was released, so you may find me a bit paranoid.The things that I most enjoy about films from this era is their virtually-ironclad understanding of ethics and fear of God.  It's for this reason that initially, I was turned off by Carousel.  There were times, in fact, midway through the film, where I felt that it was genuinely trying to lose me, and working hard to ditch both the ethical and theological beliefs of its audience, but after having thought about it for a while, however, I'm no longer convinced of that.Carousel is a Rodgers & Hammerstein production, and like all of their classic productions, it's rich with music and dance, and the singing is excellent.  They clearly had to go to a lot of trouble to find talent for films like this, and I appreciate the work they did.  Before computers started taking the place of actors, this was how it was always done, though certainly they did it better than most.  The sets are nice, the costumes appropriately-tasteful for the most part, though not extravagant, and the performances of dancing and singing were impressively-done.In this film, a carousel barker named Billy Bigelow falls for a young girl named Julie, and they later elope together.  Billy, however, has never been able to control his temper, and is more than a little arrogant and self-righteous to boot, to say nothing of being rash, impulsive and having an easy time justifying acts of wickedness, if he thinks he can get something out of it, and he's the main character of the drama.Eventually, it turns out that Julie is pregnant, and Billy commits to assisting a delinquent friend of his (even worse than him) in robbing a rich man in order to help support his own family.  However, the robbery doesn't go off as planned, and Billy dies in the process.  He ends up in a place that certainly isn't Heaven, but doesn't quite seem to be Hell either, and there, he's given one day to go back to Earth and change things for the betterment of his wife and daughter, who is now fifteen.Billy is depicted as a reprobate at every turn.  For a while, I figured this film would pull out of that trend, much like Groundhog Day or Liar Liar.  However, much to my surprise, the character retains his rash, foolish, arrogant demeanor up to the very end, regardless of any positive character traits that he might also have.At first, that confused me, because many of the other characters seemed so accomodating to his behavior, even to the point of treating his abuse like it was something other that what it was; a lack of real consideration for other people's feelings.  I just couldn't make heads or tails of what they were trying to say.I was ready to pronounce firm judgement on this film based on that alone, when it occurred to me to look at it in a different way, and suddenly, I found that the film, while still imperfect, wasn't trying to tear ethics to shreds anymore.  If I were to rate this film, though, I would label it PG-13, because moral people will dislike it unless they look at it in one specific way.  Just the fact that I have to think about it this way, though, is probably a point for it, rather than against it.This movie is essentially the story of an anti-hero struggling for redemption, while still burdened by all his own faults.  In some ways, this story is tragic, and the character of Billy Bigelow is tragic as well, because his own behavior and pride are what keep him from this redemption, but he is at least able to change enough that the people closest to him don't suffer too much from his presence in their lives.In that respect, it's a bit like trying to filter ""It's a Wonderful Life"" through ""The Picture of Dorian Gray.""  They go out of their way to imply that Billy is definitely as much of a jerk as he seems to be; that he really is guilty of everything the other characters accuse him of, and that he has absolutely no regrets about it, aside from the way things turned out.  However, he does still seem to have this desire to not hurt the people in his life, even though it doesn't motivate any of his real actions until the very end of the picture.The other characters, however, give him much more leeway than he deserves, and he, predictably, abuses their trust.  Again and again, he makes a mess of his life, and it's only by great care and subtlety that he manages to avoid destroying his wife and daughter too.This, I'm convinced, was the real point of the movie; the fact that our actions do have consequences for the people in our lives, for good or ill.  By dwelling on this wicked man, and how he ruined his own life, we can be led to question our own actions; are we truly doing the right thing, or are we leading ourselves down a path of despair and emptiness by thinking too much of our own desires, when others depend on us?Watching the film with this mentality dispels all my issues with it except two, and these two are the reason why I gave it one star down.  The first is that half the musical numbers felt surreal and abstract, as if they didn't really belong where they were put, and didn't have much to do with the plot of the movie as a whole, but this is just a design choice when you get down to it, and it's not movie-wrecking on its own.The second point is Louise on the beach in her invisible stockings and shoes.  Near the end of the film, one of the characters says that Louise is on the beach in stockings and shoes, just like Billy used to be, but when we see her, she's completely barefoot, and not only that, but she does several dance moves which reveal virtually her whole legs under her dress, just before a selection of oddly-dressed circus performers dance out and imitate a carousel.  Not only is this completely out of nowhere, but if this were a more recent film, I'd almost accuse it of doing this whole sequence for shock value.  Heck, if it were a more recent film, it WOULD have been done for shock value, and it would have been a lot more shocking and revealing, so I'm glad it wasn't a more recent film.  I hope no one ever re-makes this movie, based on this alone.  What's going on on the screen may seem tame to us, but in the fifties, this was what it meant to push the bar, and I'm not really in favor of doing that.On the whole, though, this is not an unenjoyable movie.  Just don't show it to kids, because the mixed messages are so thick, you could cut them with a broadaxe.  I said earlier that I'd rate this PG-13, and I stand by that.  If you show this to your kids, be prepared to do a lot of parental guiding.",4,"Mixed Messages, for a Film this Old...",1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,6639,"['review', 'few', 'spoilers', ""'m"",

It was released three weeks ago in Australia and must surely be available at Amazon within the next few weeks. It has been released with two disc special editions here of ""the King and I"" and ""South Pacific""(the best of the set) and of course ""Oklahoma"" and ""State Fair"" which have been available in the States for some time. Why three of these musicals were kept from release in the States is one of the mysteries of the age. Regardless ""Carousel"" is finally in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen and unlike the current print available is a beautifully remastered, clear as bell color print finally restoring this movie to its long overdue glory. Two discs have several features (not as many as the other R&H movies)some nice tidy specials and sequences from the 1954 Ford Anniversary special with the Original Broadway cast doing the entire 14 minute bench scene. The big disappointment is the audio commentary, for even though it has Shirley Jones and Nick Redman chatting away merrily (as in ""Oklahoma"") their knowledge of the movie is scant to say the least. They have to struggle to remember Robert Rounseville and Gene Lockhart's names(did not anyone supply them with a cast list) and even though there are some interesting vignettes along the way (such as how Barbara Ruick died so young and was married to John Williams the movie composer),they need some more info on the script of the musical itself.For instance, Shirley has played in the movie and when recording the commentary was playing Cousin Nettie on stage, yet no one seemed to ever tell her that Billy Bigelow always committed suicide in the stage versions and his falling on his knife was a cop out for the movie version to soften the darkness of the script and his intent. She says she loved the Lincoln Centre production, but clearly missed the lines about suicide and makes an idiotic comment about the falling on the knife being an idea they copied from ""Oklahoma"" (only the screenwriters, Shirley).This takes away from an otherwise delightful release, hopefully you will get it in the States soon.",4,Carousel in all its glory  at last,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,2163,"['Fans', 'movie', 'Carousel', 'be', 'prepared', 'last', 'two', 'disc', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'way', 'was', 'released', 'three', 'weeks', 'ago', 'Australia', 'must', 'surely', 'be', 'available', 'Amazon', 'next', 'few', 'weeks', 'been', 'released', 'two', 'disc', 'special', 'editions', 'here', 'King', 'South', 'Pacific', 'best', 'set', 'course', 'Oklahoma', 'State', 'Fair', 'have', 'been', 'available', 'States', 'time', 'Why', 'three', 'musicals', 'were', 'kept', 'release', 'States', 'one', 'mysteries', 'age', 'Regardless', 'Carousel', 'finally', '16:9', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'current', 'print', 'available', 'beautifully', 'remastered', 'clear', 'bell', 'color', 'print', 'finally', 'restoring', 'movie', 'long', 'overdue', 'glory', 'Two', 'discs', 'have', 'several', 'features', 'not', 'as', 'many', 'other', 'R', 'H', 'movies', 'nice', 'tidy', 'specials', 'sequences', '1954', 'Ford', 'Anniversary', 'special', 'Original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'doing', 'entire', '14', 'minute', 'bench', 'scene', 'big', 'disappointment', 'audio', 'commentary', 'even', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Nick', 'Redman', 'chatting', 'away', 'merrily', 'Oklahoma', 'knowledge', 'movie', 'scant', 'say', 'least', 'have', 'struggle', 'remember', 'Robert', 'Rounseville', 'Gene', 'Lockhart', 'names', 'did', 'not', 'anyone', 'supply', 'cast', 'list', 'even', 'are', 'interesting', 'vignettes', 'way', 'such', 'how', 'Barbara', 'Ruick', 'died', 'so', 'young', 'was', 'married', 'John', 'Williams', 'movie', 'composer', 'need', 'more', 'info', 'script', 'musical', 'itself.For', 'instance', 'Shirley', 'played', 'movie', 'when', 'recording', 'commentary', 'was', 'playing', 'Cousin', 'Nettie', 'stage', 'yet', 'one', 'seemed', 'ever', 'tell', 'Billy', 'Bigelow', 'always', 'committed', 'suicide', 'stage', 'versions', 'falling', 'knife', 'was', 'cop', 'out', 'movie', 'version', 'soften', 'darkness', 'script', 'intent', 'loved', 'Lincoln', 'Centre', 'production', 'clearly', 'missed', 'lines', 'suicide', 'idiotic', 'comment', 'falling', 'knife', 'being', 'idea', 'copied', 'Oklahoma', 'only', 'screenwriters', 'Shirley', '.This', 'away', 'otherwise', 'delightful', 'release', 'hopefully', 'will', 'get', 'States', 'soon']",N/A

I was unprepared for ""Carousel.""  The themes in this movie are dark and the protagonist is not particularly sympathetic.  Much of the music is deeper and the tunes are less catchy than those in other musicals.  In spite of these differences, this musical does have its moments and has an ending worth waiting for.Billy Bigelow (Gordon MacRae, ""By the Light of the Silvery Moon"" and ""Oklahoma"") is the barker at a carousel on the coast of Maine.  Billy is smooth-talking and has a way with women.  When Billy meets beautiful Julie Jordan (Shirley Jones in one of her earliest roles), a woman changes him for the first time in his life.Billy fails to get into the spirit of being married.  Indeed, he hits Julie in a scene that positively made me cringe.  Billy seems to be on the verge of going back to being a single carousel barker.  I think I would have been happier for Julie as opposed to having her married an abuser, but Julie tells him that he is going to be a father.  Billy realizes that he has to get serious about his responsibilities as a father and a husband.  Unfortunately, he allows a ""friend"" to talk him into taking part in a robbery that goes awry, and Julie and future daughter Louise no longer have a husband and father.We meet Billy at the beginning of the movie in heaven, having yet to learn of Billy's past.  Billy seems introspective and less than happy with being in heaven.  Billy learns that there is trouble on earth with his daughter.  Billy talks with his boss in heaven and describes the events in his life leading up to how he came to heaven, thus enabling us to learn why Billy is unhappy.  Because there may be some people who have yet to see this movie, I am going to stop describing the plot at this point.The painful part of this movie is dreading what will happen to Billy.  We know he is in heaven, but we sense that he has not yet found redemption for his behavior on earth.  Somehow it seems that he needs to return to earth to redeem not only himself, but us for our patience in waiting for the end of the movie.  Indeed, some of our dread may be that our waiting will be in vain.  Never fear, the end of the movie is satisfying and you will be glad you waited.Enjoy!",4,A Dark & Poignant Musical,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,2410,"['have', 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'musicals', 'think', 'liked', 'nearly', 'including', 'Music', 'Man', 'Oklahoma', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'Seven', 'Brothers', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'many', 'more', 'was', 'unprepared', 'Carousel', 'themes', 'movie', 'are', 'dark', 'protagonist', 'not', 'particularly', 'sympathetic', 'Much', 'music', 'deeper', 'tunes', 'are', 'less', 'catchy', 'other', 'musicals', 'spite', 'differences', 'musical', 'have', 'moments', 'ending', 'worth', 'waiting', 'for.Billy', 'Bigelow', 'Gordon', 'MacRae', 'Light', 'Silvery', 'Moon', 'Oklahoma', 'barker', 'carousel', 'coast', 'Maine', 'Billy', 'smooth-talking', 'way', 'women', 'When', 'Billy', 'beautiful', 'Julie', 'Jordan', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'one', 'earliest', 'roles', 'woman', 'first', 'time', 'life.Billy', 'get', 'spirit', 'being', 'married', 'Indeed', 'Julie', 'scene', 'positively', 'made', 'cringe', 'Billy', 'be', 'verge', 'going', 'back', 'being', 'single', 'carousel', 'barker', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'happier', 'Julie', 'opposed', 'having', 'married', 'abuser', 'Julie', 'going', 'be', 'father', 'Billy', 'get', 'serious', 'responsibilities', 'father', 'husband', 'Unfortunately', 'friend', 'talk', 'taking', 'part', 'robbery', 'awry', 'Julie', 'future', 'daughter', 'Louise', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'husband', 'father.We', 'meet', 'Billy', 'beginning', 'movie', 'heaven', 'having', 'yet', 'learn', 'Billy', 'past', 'Billy', 'introspective', 'less', 'happy', 'being', 'heaven', 'Billy', 'trouble', 'earth', 'daughter', 'Billy', 'talks', 'boss', 'heaven', 'events', 'life', 'leading', 'up', 'how', 'came', 'heaven', 'thus', 'enabling', 'learn', 'why', 'Billy', 'unhappy', 'may', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'movie', 'am', 'going', 'stop', 'describing', 'plot', 'point.The', 'painful', 'part', 'movie', 'dreading', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Billy', 'know', 'heaven', 'sense', 'not', 'yet', 'found', 'redemption', 'behavior', 'earth', 'Somehow', 'return', 'earth', 'redeem', 'not', 'only', 'patience', 'waiting', 'end', 'movie', 'Indeed', 'dread', 'may', 'be', 'waiting', 'will', 'be', 'vain', 'Never', 'fear', 'end', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'waited.Enjoy']",N/A

Gordon Macrae is the carousel barker, Billy Bigelow, who falls in love with the lovely millworker, Julie Jordan, portrayed by the talented Shirley Jones. The road to happiness is paved with wife abuse, criminal acts, and tragedy, not the usual items found in musicals.The score of ""Carousel"" is probably one the greatest ever composed for the musical theatre. ""If I Loved You"" is sung by the couple in a lovers' lane setting where their attitudes and emotions are conveyed by Rodgers' bittersweet melody and Hammerstein's wonderful lyrics. ""June is Bustin' Out All Over"" is danced and sung by the ensemble of youthful denizens of the Maine town where the story is set. The choreography is delightful, somewhat reminiscent of the athletic-balletic dancing in ""7 Brides for 7 Brothers"". Gordon Macrae's moving performance of ""Soliloquy"" along the rocky seashore with its crashing waves is nothing short of perfection. Frank Sinatra was originally to have the role, but to be frank, he looked a little silly in the costume worn by the character as seen in a still photograph shown in a documentary about Rodgers and Hammerstein.The cinematography is spectacular using the Cinemascope 55 process. Of course, the film must be seen in its widescreen version available on DVD and soon to be re-released on DVD in a 2 disc 50th Anniversary edition. I first saw ""Carousel"" at the Roxy Theatre when it opened in 1956. The huge screen seemed like a window looking out on the world of these star-crossed characters. The sound was stereophonic and still is in its video incarnations.Supporting performances are also fine. Cameron Mitchell is Billy's bad influence. Barbara Ruick and Robert Rounsville have magnificent voices and sing the lovely ""When the Children Are Asleep"" against the panoramic scenery of a June sailboat ride to a clambake. At the clambake, the chorus lead by Claramae Turner sings the heart out of ""A Real Nice Clambake"". Turner also sings the anthem ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" at a tragic turning point in the film.The best way to see ""Carousel"" is in a theatre, but see it. It is sometimes shown on the Fox Movie Channel in its original widescreen version.

It's currently unavailable on DVD, and really deserves to be more widely known.  While it's not an R&H; musical -- which I guess gave the '62 Pat Boone musical re-make an edge for inclusion here -- it's probably the most accurate screen production of the best-selling novel by Phil Stong.  With Will Rogers, Janet Gaynor, and Lew Ayres as the stars, and a very low-key, gentle sense of humor that brings out the warmth of the story, I'm sure that many would see it as the real inspiration for the excellent R&H; musical film from a dozen years later.  Heck, the 1933 film even includes extensive background shots of the actual Iowa State Fair, although I don't think the stars were photographed on location.  (Frankly, I could live without the Pat Boone version, which unaccountably transfers the state fair from its Iowa origin to Texas, although I do like Tom Ewell and Alice Faye very much.)I hope that Fox will soon release State Fair (1933) -- perhaps as part of the highly anticipated (by me, anyway) third Will Rogers box set.",5,"Great films, but missing one great ancestor",1220400000,"09 3, 2008",2008,1260,"['R', 'H', 'films', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'presentations', 'great', 'musicals', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more', 'detailed', 'positive', 'comments', 'them.But', 'do', 'wish', 'first', 'version', 'State', 'Fair', '1933', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'currently', 'unavailable', 'DVD', 'really', 'be', 'more', 'widely', 'known', 'not', 'R', 'H', 'musical', 'guess', 'gave', ""'62"", 'Pat', 'Boone', 'musical', 're-make', 'edge', 'inclusion', 'here', 'probably', 'most', 'accurate', 'screen', 'production', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'Phil', 'Stong', 'Will', 'Rogers', 'Janet', 'Gaynor', 'Lew', 'Ayres', 'stars', 'very', 'low-key', 'gentle', 'sense', 'humor', 'out', 'warmth', 'story', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'would', 'see', 'real', 'inspiration', 'excellent', 'R', 'H', 'musical', 'film', 'dozen', 'years', 'later', 'Heck', '1933', 'film', 'even', 'extensive', 'shots', 'actual', 'Iowa', 'State', 'Fair', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'stars', 'were', 'photographed', 'location', 'Frankly', 'could', 'live', 'Pat', 'Boone', 'version', 'unaccountably', 'state', 'fair', 'Iowa', 'origin', 'Texas', 'do', 'Tom', 'Ewell', 'Alice', 'Faye', 'very', 'much', 'hope', 'Fox', 'will', 'soon', 'release', 'State', 'Fair', '1933', 'perhaps', 'part', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'anyway', 'third', 'Will', 'Rogers', 'box', 'set']",N/A

So what did they do? Oh, just merely edit out two movie sequences containing the songs ""You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan"" and ""Blow High, Blow Low"". Hello? And how long was the classic 1939 ""Gone With the Wind""? Over three hours? What a pity, because Rodgers & Hammerstein's wonderful ""Carousel"" (their personal favorite musical) deserved to be seen complete, no matter how long it may have been!! The deleted scenes added to the story and the songs were great. Luckily the two deleted songs can be heard on the VERY COMPLETE movie CD soundtrack (see my review of it). Since so many DVDs these days are coming out with Director's Cut versions of more recent movies, perhaps ""Carousel"" may one day be re-released in it's glorious entirety, that is unless the Hollywood morons of 1956 threw away the deleted film!! For the time being, let's be thankful for the ""Carousel"" of which I'm writing. Highly Recommended.UPDATE:On the recently reissued 2-CD set of ""Carousel"" is the 1934 french film ""Liliom"", in which ""Carousel"" is based upon.

They come from different backgrounds, she, a cotton factory worker, and he, a Carousel barker. However, their love for one another does not separate them despite the fact that Bigelow experiences hard times, losing his job as a Carousel barker, and the most tragic, dying from a knife wound.  Julie presses on, and 15 years pass when Bigelow has the opportunity come back to earth to meet his teenage daughter, and for a brief moment during her graduation, express his love for Julie and his daughter.Rodgers and Hammertein's CAROUSEL is a wonderful musical that the entire family will enjoy.  How can one not love the dramatic acting by Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae, and their glorious singing with songs, such as ""Never Walk Alone"" and ""If I loved You?"" The film contains a non-stop presentation of unforgettable and long drawn choreography scenes (check out the Riverdance like number) and period costumes that offer the viewer a glimpse of a Maine fishing village possibly during the nineteenth or turn of the century; the costumes and dance numbers are amazing enough to take a first or second look at one legendary production of a film.CAROUSEL and its THX sound and re-mastered Cinemascope Technicolor will be a delight for the avid movie lover.

Raitt is a somewhat stronger high baritone than Gordon MacRae, but both in my view served the role well vocally.I won't get into the plot and performances which are covered extensively in other reviews, but did want to comment on Shirley Jones' commentary--especially regarding Frank Sinatra, who was supposed to play Billy--prerecorded the songs, but dropped out of the movie, it was said, because he didn't want to do an extra take for the cinemascope cameras. Shirley doesn't shed any light on this, and Frank told her he didn't want to discuss it.Sinatra was at the peak of his powers as a singer in the mid-50s.I've heard tapes of some of his ""Carousel"" 1955 pre-recordings, and he sings very well, though he lacks the strong highs MacRae brought from his vocal training. Sinatra, however, had more depth as an actor, and would have made the dark ""tough"" side of Billy more vivid.Shirley Jones, on the other hand, had great chemistry with MacRae, evident previously in ""Oklahoma"", and you wonder why he hadn't been the first choice.Contrary to what Shirley says, Frank did pre-record Soliloquy in 3 takes, subsequently recorded it again for release in 1963 and, remarkably, sang it in concert in his 70s which was released in 1995. In the latter he used the original ""barroom"" lyrics from the initial Broadway production cut from the movie. He also used these lyrics in his original Columbia recording in 1946. Sinatra had great savvy with a lyric, and he obviously relishes ""Soliloquy"", expecially the concert version in his 70s, which I think, incredibly, is his best effort.He sings it like a guy who has been there, done that--with a great deal of  conviction.Perhaps he regretted not playing the role.One wonders what kind of a movie ""Carousel"" would have been with Sinatra as Billy. And Vincente Minnelli as Director instead of Henry King.What would Minnelli have done with the sets? Safe to say it would have been different--on both counts.",5,What if MacRae... was Sinatra?,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,2702,"['count', 'Carousel', 'one', 'three', 'best', 'American', 'theater', 'musicals', 'ever', 'Porgy', 'Bess', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'R', 'H', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'musicals', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'best', 'music', 'best', 'story', '50th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'blu-ray', 'two', 'CDs', 'high', 'quality', 'video', 'lots', 'extras', 'highlighted', 'commentary', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'duet', 'Loved', 'original', 'Broadway', 'Jan', 'Clayton', 'John', 'Raitt', '1954', 'TV', 'show.I', 'sang', 'group', 'included', 'Jan', 'Clayton', 'understudy', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'member', 'chorus', 'local', 'production', 'show', 'Clayton', 'slightly', 'darker', 'soprano', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'pixie', 'quality', 'not', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'who', 'introduced', 'duet', 'TV', 'show', 'Raitt', 'somewhat', 'stronger', 'high', 'baritone', 'Gordon', 'MacRae', 'view', 'served', 'role', 'well', 'vocally.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'plot', 'performances', 'are', 'covered', 'extensively', 'other', 'reviews', 'did', 'want', 'comment', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'commentary', 'especially', 'regarding', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'play', 'Billy', 'prerecorded', 'songs', 'dropped', 'movie', 'was', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'extra', 'take', 'cinemascope', 'cameras', 'Shirley', ""n't"", 'shed', 'light', 'Frank', 'told', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'discuss', 'it.Sinatra', 'was', 'peak', 'powers', 'singer', 'mid-50s.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'tapes', 'Carousel', '1955', 'pre-recordings', 'very', 'well', 'strong', 'highs', 'MacRae', 'brought', 'vocal', 'training', 'Sinatra', 'however', 'had', 'more', 'depth', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'dark', 'tough', 'side', 'Billy', 'more', 'vivid.Shirley', 'Jones', 'other', 'hand', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'MacRae', 'evident', 'previously', 'Oklahoma', 'wonder', 'why', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'first', 'choice.Contrary', 'what', 'Shirley', 'Frank', 'did', 'pre-record', 'Soliloquy', '3', 'subsequently', 'recorded', 'again', 'release', '1963', 'remarkably', 'sang', 'concert', '70s', 'was', 'released', '1995', 'latter', 'used', 'original', 'barroom', 'lyrics', 'initial', 'Broadway', 'production', 'cut', 'movie', 'also', 'used', 'lyrics', 'original', 'Columbia', 'recording', '1946', 'Sinatra', 'had', 'great', 'savvy', 'lyric', 'obviously', 'Soliloquy', 'expecially', 'concert', 'version', '70s', 'think', 'incredibly', 'best', 'effort.He', 'sings', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'great', 'deal', 'conviction.Perhaps', 'regretted', 'not', 'playing', 'role.One', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'Carousel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Sinatra', 'Billy', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'Director', 'instead', 'Henry', 'King.What', 'would', 'Minnelli', 'have', 'done', 'sets', 'Safe', 'say', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'counts']",N/A

She was so innocent, so vulnerable looking, so beautiful, so talented.  After seeing this again, it is still Shirley Jones who makes this worthwhile.  But there are nagging difficulties that I can't get past.Some of the songs and dance numbers are simply wonderful--""June is Bustin' Out All Over,"" ""If I Loved You,"" for examples.  Then there are some long and seemingly pointless bits, such as the interminable dance on the beach by Billy's daughter et al.But the most distressing element is the closing ""message,"" that a woman hit by a man who loves her doesn't feel the hurt.  It goes with the song with the line ""He's your fella' and you love him, and that's all there is to that.""  Well, nonsense.  That isn't something I'd want to teach my daughter, not something my wife or any other rational woman would stand for today.  ""Stand By Your Man"" may be the mantra of some in the trailer parks, but it's wrong.  I can't help but cringe, even though I know that in the ethos of the 1950s few moviegoers complained.  After all, Ricky turned Luci over his knee and spanked her when she spent too much money, and people watching on TV were amused by it.  Lynching blacks was also approved by many people at one time.That moral takes away a great deal from the movie.

It can be difficult today to understand how groundbreaking this show was, not only in terms of subject matter, but in the way Rodgers and Hammerstein revolutionized the treatment of songs and their relationship to plot and characterization. Before R&amp;H, few musicals addressed serious issues. The musical numbers tended to be showstoppers designed to showcase the strengths of the performer: it wasn't unusual to lift a number out of one show and insert into another to suit the whims of whoever was the star of the moment. After Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein this became impossible: one could never, for example, take a song from The King and I and arbitrarily put it into Oklahoma! Gordon MacRae might not be John Raitt, but he's wonderful in this film, and Shirley Jones gives one of the best performances in the history of American movie musicals. There really isn't a weak link in this cast. I'll admit that, by today's standards, Carousel might seem a bit sentimental. If you're at all interested in American theatre history, you must see this.

The story contains the characters of Julie (Shirley Jones), a young lady who works at the mill, and Billy (Gordon McRae), a carousel barker. Both find love in the most unexpected place-each other. And because of that, they both lose their jobs. Then, when they both go to live with Julie's cousin, Billy, unemployed, is driven angry with nothing to do and abuses his wife, Julie. During the annual clam bake, his friend Jigger convinces him to take a knife to try to rob the mill owner of his money. Caught with nowhere to run, Billy accidently lands on his knife and is killed. (the scene where Julie comes to be by her husband's side in his final moments is very moving-my favorite scene.) Then up with the stars, he finds out he can go back for one day, to help his 15-year-old daughter (Julie just found out she was pregnant right before he was killed) keep from making the same mistake he did. During her graduation, he finally gets to show the love he has for his family, because he never had the chance to say it when he was alive.

The restored color, 2.55 ratio wide-screen for CinemaScope 55, and remastered sound are awesome.  This is like opening night in 1956 New York.CAROUSEL is based on Molnar's Hungarian play LILIOM, which was filmed by Fritz Lang in 1934 France with a superb Charles Boyer.  A complete studio print of Lang's LILIOM is just one of many bonuses on disk two.  Rodgers and Hammerstein added some of their most memorable songs (""You'll Never Walk Alone,:"" ""If I Loved You,"" ""June is Bustin' Out All Over""), built up the role of Julie to make her a strong and likeable heroine, and gave the whole show a Heaven framework.  (LILIOM has Julie in a supporting role, no songs, and Heaven only shown in the last reel.)  Billy Bigelow is a carnival barker in a New England seaport (location filming was done in Maine) who loses his job, marries shy and lovely Julie, gets her pregnant, then dies during an evocative clambake.

I think Everyone else told what It Is about, My favorite part Is where the 2 teams of Dancers are competing against each Other, They get a smoking. I would like to see this movie on Blu-Ray though there are around 30 movies that I would like on Blu-Ray some are Not yet available on Blu-Ray yet as Mary Poppins, Song Of Norway, April In Paris, Hello Dolly, April Love, and some other movies. I usually buy movies used on VHS or DVD save much money buying used. If Its a black & white or a cartoon then I will buy It on VHS If Its a very good movie I will buy It on DVD but If Its a classic I buy It on Blu-Ray but I think Blu-Ray Is over priced after all when People bought DVD They though They were buying the best Not knowing They were being lied to by these corporations trying to sell them a new copy that has been compressed or should I say stripped. In the 1970's & 80' & 90's a large screen CRT was 25 Inch and People did Not complain about the picture quality If They got a good reception & the vertical hold was Not off but People want a television with good color and the old CRT which People I read on web still wish made which has a brighter clearer more colorful picture than these newer plasma and LCD televisions and now they are trying to get Us for more money coming out with LED television. People have asked Is It worth buying Blu-Ray If have standard television? Absolutely, I just said movies on DVD were compressed or should I say stripped so You will notice a difference. I have watched this movie on both standard CRT television and My Computer LCD wide screen monitor, the standard CRT looks better but It cuts some of the picture off but the wide screen more of the picture Is visible and I Am Not just saying that, this Is a true wide screen movie shot on 70 mm film Not a compressed or chopped off picture to look like wide screen.",5,good movie,1289347200,"11 10, 2010",2010,1871,"['Good', 'movie', 'think', 'Everyone', 'else', 'told', 'what', 'about', 'My', 'favorite', 'part', 'where', '2', 'teams', 'Dancers', 'are', 'competing', 'Other', 'get', 'smoking', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'movie', 'Blu-Ray', 'are', '30', 'movies', 'would', 'like', 'Blu-Ray', 'are', 'Not', 'yet', 'available', 'Blu-Ray', 'yet', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Song', 'Norway', 'April', 'Paris', 'Hello', 'Dolly', 'April', 'Love', 'other', 'movies', 'usually', 'buy', 'movies', 'used', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'save', 'much', 'money', 'buying', 'used', 'black', 'white', 'cartoon', 'then', 'will', 'buy', 'VHS', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'will', 'buy', 'DVD', 'classic', 'buy', 'Blu-Ray', 'think', 'Blu-Ray', 'priced', 'when', 'People', 'bought', 'DVD', 'were', 'buying', 'best', 'Not', 'knowing', 'were', 'being', 'lied', 'corporations', 'trying', 'sell', 'new', 'copy', 'been', 'compressed', 'should', 'say', 'stripped', '1970', '80', '90', 'large', 'screen', 'CRT', 'was', '25', 'Inch', 'People', 'did', 'Not', 'complain', 'picture', 'quality', 'got', 'good', 'reception', 'vertical', 'hold', 'was', 'Not', 'off', 'People', 'want', 'television', 'good', 'color', 'old', 'CRT', 'People', 'read', 'web', 'still', 'wish', 'made', 'brighter', 'clearer', 'more', 'colorful', 'picture', 'newer', 'plasma', 'LCD', 'televisions', 'now', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'Us', 'more', 'money', 'coming', 'out', 'LED', 'television', 'People', 'have', 'asked', 'worth', 'buying', 'Blu-Ray', 'have', 'standard', 'television', 'Absolutely', 'just', 'said', 'movies', 'DVD', 'were', 'compressed', 'should', 'say', 'stripped', 'so', 'will', 'notice', 'difference', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'standard', 'CRT', 'television', 'My', 'Computer', 'LCD', 'wide', 'screen', 'monitor', 'standard', 'CRT', 'better', 'picture', 'off', 'wide', 'screen', 'more', 'picture', 'visible', 'Am', 'Not', 'just', 'saying', 'true', 'wide', 'screen', 'movie', 'shot', '70', 'mm', 'film', 'Not', 'compressed', 'chopped', 'off', 'picture', 'look', 'wide', 'screen']",N/A

In  fact, it is critical of Billy Bigelow's abuse of his wife.Other than  the controversial themes examined in this movie, I think few would argue  that the score contains some of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein's  best work, particularly &quot;If I Loved You&quot; and &quot;You'll Never  Walk Alone&quot; which are heartachingly beautiful pieces.

Alas it is not one of the most successful or widely seen possibly because it opens with its weakest scene - Billy in some after life ""polishing the stars"".  I almost gave up on the movie after seeing that both surreal and corny set despite having seen and loved the stage production but thankfully the rest of the movie is much much better.  Though it has dark themes the movie is quite beautiful to look it with much of it filmed on location at the Maine coast with many colorful costumes and of course the songs are both memorable and well performed.  Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae are perfect as Julie and Billy a couple who should have never gotten together romantically but tragically somehow did.  Some have felt that the movie condones spousal abuse because Julie excuses Billy's violence toward her but I saw his hitting as just another example of his many character flaws and her acceptance a part of her dangerously sweet nature and the audience should be smart enough to connect the dots that this is a BAD way to behave.  The other characters in the play are shocked by it and I believe we are supposed to be also.  The movie is quite long and though well executed the long dance scenes don't play as well on film as they do in live theater and could have used some pruning.  There is some comic relief from the well played Carrie and Enoch Snow and their eventual nine children and practical Cousin Nettie and slimy Jigger also add interest.  The closing scene where Billy's spirit somehow forces Louise's spirit to listen to the wise words in the graduation speech is very moving.  Wise words for us all to live by in that no one can change what their parents might be or have been and that instead of worrying about whether people like us we would do better worrying about liking people.",5,One Of The Best Films From A Broadway Musical,1184889600,"07 20, 2007",2007,1921,"['CAROUSEL', 'one', 'best', 'many', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'made', 'movies', 'came', 'out', '1950', '1960', 'Alas', 'not', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'widely', 'seen', 'possibly', 'weakest', 'scene', 'Billy', 'life', 'polishing', 'stars', 'almost', 'gave', 'up', 'movie', 'seeing', 'surreal', 'corny', 'set', 'having', 'seen', 'loved', 'stage', 'production', 'thankfully', 'rest', 'movie', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'dark', 'themes', 'movie', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'look', 'much', 'filmed', 'location', 'Maine', 'coast', 'many', 'colorful', 'costumes', 'course', 'songs', 'are', 'memorable', 'well', 'performed', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Gordon', 'MacRae', 'are', 'perfect', 'Julie', 'Billy', 'couple', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'gotten', 'together', 'romantically', 'tragically', 'somehow', 'did', 'have', 'felt', 'movie', 'condones', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'Julie', 'Billy', 'violence', 'saw', 'hitting', 'as', 'just', 'example', 'many', 'character', 'flaws', 'acceptance', 'part', 'dangerously', 'sweet', 'nature', 'audience', 'should', 'be', 'smart', 'enough', 'connect', 'dots', 'BAD', 'way', 'behave', 'other', 'characters', 'play', 'are', 'shocked', 'believe', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'also', 'movie', 'quite', 'long', 'though', 'well', 'executed', 'long', 'dance', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'do', 'live', 'theater', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'pruning', 'comic', 'relief', 'well', 'played', 'Carrie', 'Enoch', 'Snow', 'eventual', 'nine', 'children', 'practical', 'Cousin', 'Nettie', 'slimy', 'Jigger', 'also', 'add', 'interest', 'closing', 'scene', 'where', 'Billy', 'spirit', 'somehow', 'forces', 'Louise', 'spirit', 'listen', 'wise', 'words', 'graduation', 'speech', 'very', 'moving', 'Wise', 'words', 'live', 'one', 'can', 'change', 'what', 'parents', 'might', 'be', 'have', 'been', 'instead', 'worrying', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'worrying', 'liking', 'people']",N/A

It is the product of a time period in film making history that produced great, extraordinaire, & epic musicals that could never be topped. The music and the story were written by the dynamic duo known as Rodgers and Hammerstein. Carousel is essentially about a carney barker criminal type named Billy Bigelow. He is employed as a hype man for a carnival carousel.  This doesn't necessary sound like the backdrop for the greatest story ever told, but with the proper direction Henry King was able to turn this number into a classic of the big band song & dance variety.  The story is basically about Billy Bigelow falling in love, dying young, and returning to make things right.

To some degree, that is true.  Yes, the screenplay does  &quot;soften&quot; it by giving away a major plot point at the beginning of  the movie, so it would be easier to take.  (I won't say more, in case you  haven't seen it)  And some of the score was deleted from the final print,  which hurts it in the beginning.  On stage, &quot;If I Loved You&quot; is  dialogue with musical interludes leading up to the song itself.  It is a  beautiful scene, as the music is used to express emotions the characters  can not speak, to thrilling effect.  But on film, it's just dialogue  leading up to the (shortened) song, which cuts away some of the power and  impact.  The spell cast on stage is not to be found here, though Gordon  McRae and Shirley Jones sing well.  The deleted &quot;You're a Queer One,  Julie Jordan&quot; is also missed.But after the dissapointing beginning,  &quot;along come&quot; the spirited rendition of &quot;June Is Bustin' Out  All Over&quot; by the cast.  From then on, the film is much more engaging  and better all around.  McRae and Jones, while not really up to par  dramatically, are capable of emoting enough and remain vocally stellar,  which is what we paid for, anyway, (though it shouldn't have been that  way).  McRae's &quot;Soliloquy&quot; is a true tour de force, and his  reprise of &quot;If I Loved You&quot; is truly poigniant. Jones'  &quot;What's the Use of Won'drin&quot; is beautiful and touching.  The rest  of the cast is fine, too, and certain of the later scenes retain the power  of the stage version and are just as touching.  Unfortunatly, I haven't  seen this in widescreen or on the big screen, so I can't vouch for the  much-lauded visual scope of Boothbay Harbor, Maine,  but I'm sure it's  spectacular.  (Nope, it's not all that exciting in pan-and-scan)This is  worth seeing, especially, I'm sure, in widescreen, but what you really  should do is get the film's soundtrack, which restores the deleted songs  and many of the deleted verses of other songs to better effect, and a  decent cast recording of the stage version, and see a good stage production  in your area.  Only then will you truly experience the beauty and power of  this magnificent musical.",3,"Better than it's usually given credit for, but....",960854400,"06 13, 2000",2000,2449,"['film', 'version', 'what', 'consider', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'best', 'stage', 'production', 'quot', 'Carousel', 'quot', 'generally', 'been', 'dismissed', 'critics', 'familiar', 'stage', 'show', 'poor', 'representation', 'stage', 'version', 'degree', 'true', 'Yes', 'screenplay', 'quot', 'soften', 'quot', 'giving', 'away', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'beginning', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'take', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'score', 'was', 'deleted', 'final', 'print', 'beginning', 'stage', 'quot', 'Loved', 'quot', 'dialogue', 'musical', 'interludes', 'leading', 'up', 'song', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'music', 'used', 'express', 'emotions', 'characters', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'thrilling', 'effect', 'film', 'just', 'dialogue', 'leading', 'up', 'shortened', 'song', 'away', 'power', 'impact', 'spell', 'cast', 'stage', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Gordon', 'McRae', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'sing', 'well', 'deleted', 'quot', ""'re"", 'Queer', 'One', 'Julie', 'Jordan', 'quot', 'also', 'missed.But', 'dissapointing', 'beginning', 'quot', 'come', 'quot', 'spirited', 'rendition', 'quot', 'June', 'Bustin', 'Out', 'All', 'Over', 'quot', 'cast', 'then', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'engaging', 'better', 'around', 'McRae', 'Jones', 'not', 'really', 'par', 'dramatically', 'are', 'capable', 'emoting', 'enough', 'remain', 'vocally', 'stellar', 'what', 'paid', 'anyway', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'way', 'McRae', 'quot', 'Soliloquy', 'quot', 'true', 'tour', 'force', 'reprise', 'quot', 'Loved', 'quot', 'truly', 'poigniant', 'Jones', 'quot', 'What', 'Use', ""Won'drin"", 'quot', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'rest', 'cast', 'fine', 'too', 'certain', 'later', 'scenes', 'retain', 'power', 'stage', 'version', 'are', 'just', 'touching', 'Unfortunatly', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'widescreen', 'big', 'screen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'vouch', 'much-lauded', 'visual', 'scope', 'Boothbay', 'Harbor', 'Maine', ""'m"", 'sure', 'spectacular', 'Nope', 'not', 'exciting', 'pan-and-scan', 'worth', 'seeing', 'especially', ""'m"", 'sure', 'widescreen', 'what', 'really', 'should', 'do', 'get', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'deleted', 'songs', 'many', 'deleted', 'verses', 'other', 'songs', 'better', 'effect', 'decent', 'cast', 'recording', 'stage', 'version', 'see', 'good', 'stage', 'production', 'area', 'Only', 'then', 'will', 'truly', 'experience', 'beauty', 'power', 'magnificent', 'musical']",N/A

This package includes a generous bunch of extras: documentaries, deleted material, alternate versions, interviews, running commentaries, soundtrack albums, performances by stars from the original stage productions, even a remake of STATE FAIR from 1962.

However, that is not where the issues end. The layer change is one of the most abrupt I have ever encountered, pausing long enough to make one think the disc is locking up. The image itself also is full of defects. In Chapter 13 (the soliloquy) Gordon McCray's trousers, as well as some of the background, begin to shimmer, and blend in together. In at least two places, the image jumps. Most noticeable is the scene on the dock where Julie hugs Nettie. If you step through the images using slow motion, it is easy to see the jump was a transfer ""hiccup"".This is a great movie....rather dark for a musical.
