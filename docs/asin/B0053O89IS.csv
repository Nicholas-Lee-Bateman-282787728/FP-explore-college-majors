It's really nice to have an intelligent, complicated, somewhat frightening procedural drama without babies!!! Relationships aren't everything.Little Baby Michael gets to meet his Grand Dad, and that subplot ruined the show. I'm glad that Angela and Hodges are thrilled with their baby, but I don't think he belongs at work. Baby and kiddie issues don't help this kind of drama. It's really annoying.Does anyone ever watch BBC-TV's procedurals? Luther (Luther) doesn't have babies. Boyd (Waking the Dead) has a son, but the kid never shows up at work. In fact, the kid is missing. MI-5 has a little girl, but interactions with her aren't cutesy.It seems that on American TV, shows sooner or later have to conform to some saccharine Perfect Little Family ideal, even if it shreds the dramatic composition of the show. Possibly the reason is that the corporations paying for the show are deathly afraid of any controversy and reality, and hogtie the creators. Unwittingly, they make a mess of the shows, people walk, and their very expensive ads go unseen.I have always LOVED Bones, but I've about had it with the pregnancies and babies. I like gritty, snarky procedurals, like this one USED to be. Remember the Gravedigger series?? I was truly afraid of her. Max made me really nervous.Now, it's all about sleep deprivation and child rearing theories. Too bad.

I think the main virtue of this shortened season (abbreviated to accommodate Emily Deschanel's real pregnancy)is that it was just the right mix of the old and the new. The old is all the original cast, but with a healthy salting of our favorite recurring characters, Caroline Julian, Max Keenan, Billy Gibbons, Hank Booth (Ralph Waite) and Colin Fisher (Joel David Moore). To this is added Brennan's pregnancy, a brand new relation between Brennan and Booth, and a new, very dangerous, serial killer. I dare not say more about that character, for fear of giving away some important spoilers. I will say that the new antagonist leads to what may be one of the series' most dramatic season cliffhanger, in a show which has had its share of better than average cliff hanger season enders.I case you did not notice, this season's set has only 13 episodes, instead of the usual 23 - 26. That was due to the hiatus added to allow for Deschanel's pregnancy. What is puzzling is that they did not add in episodes from ""The Finder"", a spin-off created by Hart Hanson which, as far as I can tell, only created 13 episodes. That would have created an very nice 26 episode package.The jaw-dropping final episode appears to promise that Season 8 will remain fresh, now that the event which seemed inevitable from early in the first season has finally happened, that is, Brennan and Booth become romantically linked in a substantial way, with the risk that that will dull the interchange between them, which ""drives"" the show (that turn of phrase was intentional, since most of their best conversations happen while they are driving, a tradition which dates back to season 1, episode 1, when they were not nearly as chummy as they are now.)",5,"Short season, entering new territory.",1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,1804,"['usual', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'reviews', 'hard', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'say', 'think', 'main', 'virtue', 'shortened', 'season', 'abbreviated', 'accommodate', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'real', 'pregnancy', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'old', 'new', 'old', 'original', 'cast', 'healthy', 'salting', 'favorite', 'recurring', 'characters', 'Caroline', 'Julian', 'Max', 'Keenan', 'Billy', 'Gibbons', 'Hank', 'Booth', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'Colin', 'Fisher', 'Joel', 'David', 'Moore', 'added', 'Brennan', 'pregnancy', 'brand', 'new', 'relation', 'Brennan', 'Booth', 'new', 'very', 'dangerous', 'serial', 'killer', 'dare', 'not', 'say', 'more', 'character', 'fear', 'giving', 'away', 'important', 'spoilers', 'will', 'say', 'new', 'antagonist', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'series', 'most', 'dramatic', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'show', 'had', 'share', 'better', 'average', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'season', 'enders.I', 'case', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'season', 'set', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'instead', 'usual', '23', '26', 'was', 'due', 'hiatus', 'added', 'allow', 'Deschanel', 'pregnancy', 'What', 'puzzling', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'episodes', 'Finder', 'spin-off', 'created', 'Hart', 'Hanson', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'only', 'created', '13', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'created', 'very', 'nice', '26', 'episode', 'package.The', 'jaw-dropping', 'final', 'episode', 'promise', 'Season', '8', 'will', 'remain', 'fresh', 'now', 'event', 'seemed', 'inevitable', 'early', 'first', 'season', 'finally', 'happened', 'Brennan', 'Booth', 'become', 'romantically', 'linked', 'substantial', 'way', 'risk', 'will', 'dull', 'interchange', 'drives', 'show', 'turn', 'phrase', 'was', 'intentional', 'most', 'best', 'conversations', 'happen', 'are', 'driving', 'tradition', 'back', 'season', '1', 'episode', '1', 'when', 'were', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'chummy', 'are', 'now']",Bones: Season 7

This episode discovers the killer but fails to take him down, so that is left for future episode, or episodes.  We see The Bones & Booth childbirth is closing in (6 weeks estimated), and the home that Booth finds for them is a massive renovation and restoration project in need of an Architect, and a major building contractor before it can be usable.  I would have liked them to drag back Zack Addey for his intellect to match wits with the new opponent, but sadly not a mention of the old character so many of us enjoyed.  The episode is well written and as always superbly executed by this amazingly talented cast.  The formula still works, the whole story line is open and filled with possibility, so it will hopefully continue on to another season after this.I have but one criticism, and that is the loving relationship between Bones & Booth doesn't come off as well as Booths past love interests, the intimacy between a couple who have only been lovers for about a year isn't believable. When one factors in that Booth has pined away for all those prior episodes, he doesn't seem to be as elated by his newly established intimacy with the love of his life. It all feels stiff and contrived between them, and it shouldn't.As for the freebe Finder premier episode, the basic premise is too super hero to be credible. Also these people have No Credible Means of Support.  They 'hang out' at a bar with no patrons, work for a kid who can't pay them, and drive and fly wherever they need to with money being no objection, yet no source for it.

Temperance got pregnant and this season we are going to see her delivering a child. To bring the father back into the picture because the plot needed it the baby is a girl? SO THAT Temperance is going to relive her bad experience with her father when she was a girl and he abandoned her, and her brother. But you all know that. They decide to name the girl Christine, I guess in honor of the film and the book by John Carpenter and Stephen King respectively.This season knits together some cases that solved in one episode and a couple of others that go beyond the episode structure. In that case even one that goes beyond the season structure. Suspense requires such tricks. TV is a Trickster. My favorite is ""The Don't In The Do"" in which there is no Indian but a hair fetishist who believe in scalping. Tie up your hair ladies, especially if you are gentlemen.The series uses of course many interns, rotating interns, which enables us to see some faces only episodically from time to time but repetitively every two or three episodes. That concentrates our attention on the six or so regulars and at the same time that gives us some new blood that titillates our interest.The mother Temperance is even worse than the doctor Bones. She is anxious, afraid, over protective, quasi paranoid, definitely on the verge of neurosis, which is anything but rational, and she turns every one around her completely upside down and crazy if they dare follow her along that line. You have to learn how to let the mother rant and rave about all the dangers that menace her child and hope one day she might let that child grow up, and some anxiety is needed to grow up, some challenge some would say.The most interesting part of this series is that the crimes are always extreme cases of asocial behavior and at time sociopathic derangement. It is practically always some hidden situation unknown of everyone that produces a reaction that brings forward a dead body. But in this series they always choose the grossest way to deliver the body, to wrap it up, to make it decay and rot, etc. There is no end along that line. It is always possible to make a body look more disgusting than what you have achieved in the previous episode. The rule is that you need to see the bones and to deal with the bones. You have to feel it in your buns.A last note will be about the follow up story that ends up unfinished this season. Temperance Bones is at stake and is menaced. She was too often over positive and over affirmative. It is her time to get challenged. First she is wrong about the age of the bones of a body by fifteen years over and then she becomes the main target. Luckily she has a daughter, a loving husband and a resourceful father. What will be left of her integrity after that? At least the child has been christened just in time.One thing is sure: this series tried to follow the antics of Supernatural this season and they have a dead body on the set of the film that will come out next summer on Bones, ""Bone of contention"". Real crime in a virtual crime story. In fact virtual real crime in a virtual virtual crime story.

1438528,A19XE6G6NDZFPS,B0053O89IS,Joanna Mechlinski,"[0, 1]","Season 7 of this popular drama about the relationship between a genius anthropologist (Emily Deschanel) and a cocky FBI agent (David Boreanaz) kicks off with the duo adjusting to their unplanned pregnancy and their new shared life. Although Brennan and Booth have long spent much of their waking hours together, both in and out of work, things are vastly different when they're also living under the same roof.Much of the previous seasons' conflicts stem from, and center upon, the two's clashing personalities and approaches toward life, so naturally, that also comes into play when faced with decisions on how to raise their baby daughter.Although the season is only thirteen episodes - shortened because of Deschanel's real-life pregnancy and maternity leave - a number of key episodes and plots are featured. These include ""The Hot Dog in the Competition,"" where a new intern, Finn Abernathy (Luke Kleintank) joins the Jeffersonian squints. A genius who completed years of schooling in record time, Finn would be a welcome addition to the lab - if he didn't also have a questionable past that causes some of the others to worry.In ""The Male in the Mail"" Ralph Waite returns as Booth's grandfather Pops. This time, he brings disturbing news of Booth's long-estranged father, which of course evokes Booth's memories of his troubled childhood and in turn his feelings toward being a father himself.Booth's son Parker (Ty Panitz) makes only one appearance this season, in episode 10 (""The Warrior in the Wuss"") when he returns from England and meets his baby sister. Booth and Brennan worry about how the 11-year-old, who's been an only child up to this point, will adjust to a new sibling and to the new family situation overall.Ryan O'Neal makes two guest appearances as Brennan's father Max, first in ""The Family in the Feud,"" where he offers to babysit little Christine, causing his daughter to revisit her mistrust of Max over his abandonment of Brennan as a teen. Then, in the season finale - ""The Past in the Present"" - Max again appears, this time to help his daughter and granddaughter when their lives are threatened by computer genius serial killer Christopher Pelant.As always, Tamara Taylor as Dr. Cam Saroyan, TJ Thyne as Dr. Jack Hodgins, Michaela Conlin as Angela Montenegro and John Francis Daly as Dr. Lance Sweets do an incredible job as supporting cast!

1438607,A1YQS7S1IE53SB,B0053O89IS,Wendy C. Rigney,"[40, 43]","You get season 7 of ""Bones"".While the season was only 13 episodes long, because of Emily Deschanel's pregnancy and Fox's desire to test ""The Finder"", it managed to cram in some huge changes - and big plotlines - into that short season.With the start of the season, we saw Brennan and Booth both adjusting to their new life together, awaiting the birth of their child. We also saw them let go of the last vestiges of their single lives and find a ramshackle home (which, with Wendall's FAST off screen help!) to move into. With the birth of their daughter, Christine, came a new sense of family.For many episodes, the family angle was played up. Some might even say it was played up *too much*, but with tonight's finale, I think there was a point to it, so I can understand the reasoning, even if I felt the season was drama light. Starting with ""The Crack in the Code"", we meet the likely reason for the emphasis on family. His name is Christopher Pelant, a hacker who had messed with the government and ended up with an ankle monitor for his trouble. But the viewers see that is not the end of his ""fun"", by any means. He is, very much so, an equal to the folks at the Jeffersonian in terms of brilliance. In the first episode we meet him, he manages to murder a reporter and have the remains cremated before they can be examined by altering government red tape. He also manages to fry Angela's expensive equipment when she tries to scan the bones of another erstwhile victim of his by putting malware inside said bones.An average criminal, he clearly is not.In between the Pelant arc, the audience gets a shout-out episode - using Easter eggs and hybrid staff names - as a wink and thank you to the fans, as one of Brennan's novels gets filmed into a movie. We also see how Angela and Hodgins are, themselves, adjusting to parenthood, often with Angela using her experiences to help Brennan deal with her own worries.Maybe TPTB knew there was limited time in which to really dig deep into the drama, so the fluff was used much more prevalently, in my opinion, than in past seasons, hence four stars instead of five. I like fluff, but the show is ostensibly a dramedy and there was a bit too little ""dram"" versus ""edy"". Still, I think that was to make things easier on Ms. Deschanel, and to give the viewers a quiet reprieve from the drama of the prior season.And, naturally, to really build up the happiness before Pelant made his creepy presence felt once again - in a *big way* - for the finale. In which a parallel between Booth/Brennan and Brennan's own past is made. I will not spoil what happens but, needless to say, echoes of Brennan's past make its way into the present with some heart-wrenching choices when it seems circumstances play against her. Which puts the future of Booth, Brennan, and their baby as a family in jeopardy.And with those unanswered questions, I look forward to seeing how things resolve in Season 8, which, on the bright side, looks to be a full, regular season come fall, including four ""bonus"" episodes that were ordered for either the summer or for the new season; recently, it was announced these four episodes would be included in Season 8 as stand-alone episodes (versus the usual episodes that seem to have a continuing arc).So, the moral is, enjoy the fluff while it is around - even if a bit too much - because the drama will always kick back in. Hart Hanson and Company have proven it once again.ETA: 06/20/2012: Oddly, while no release date for this set is still posted here, Amazon's Canadian site, Amazon.ca, is also taking orders and has a release date now for October 9th.
