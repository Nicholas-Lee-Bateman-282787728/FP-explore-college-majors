He takes his lawyer Nancy with him. Then he runs to a waiting car to make a getaway. Elsewhere a man returns home from work and talks to his wife about their family. Will they break-up and sell their large home? The gang switches cars and hides the getaway car. The police release that lawyer. The gang drives through an expensive neighborhood to select a home to break in. They want the keys to their station wagon. ""Trust me"" he says. They search the house for money and jewelry. Michael wants Nora to make a telephone call to Nancy. One robber finds a pistol on top of a tall dresser. The husband returns home to find a surprise! ""Why my house?"" The son returns home to play a video game.""No guns"" says Nora. Tim talks to the leader. They watch the news. Michael talks to Wally. Lawyer Nancy gets the message. The plumber rings, he is sent away with a check. Michael keeps control of things, he has the pistol. Tim receives a knife wound. That lawyer is followed, she uses a pay telephone. The police will retrieve that last number. Zack falls off the roof. The Real Estate man visits and finds bad luck. Albert uses that found gun, he wants to leave alone. He takes the Mercedes-Benz and drives off. Tim is sent to get $10,000 from his bank. There is a penalty for cancelling a CD before maturity. Tim doesn't count his cash! Tim returns home and gives the cash to Michael. The police get a report about a lone man at a country gas station. Albert runs and hides. Will he surrender peacefully? [The smart thing to do.] His pistol is traced to the Cornells. Later Nancy calls Michael to get his address. ""Its almost over."" The police offer a deal to Nancy.Nancy drives to the Cornell house. She is untouched by the police. A truck with many lights drives up to the house, Tim talks to him, this boyfriend wants to see his daughter; then they drive away. Tim gets into his car, an FBI supervisor talks to him. When the gang leaves the FBI begin firing with automatic weapons! Michael sneaks back to the house. Tim gets a pistol from one of the captured bank visitors. Michael's pistol is out of bullets! [There was a trick.] Tim drags Michael out the front door. ""Do not move"" is the order. There is a penalty for non-compliance. The good guys use guns to stop the bad guys. The Cornell family is saved. Will this affect them for the better? [We hope so.]This version is different from the 1956 version. In some ways it is better. The dim light from the night scenes is a drawback. Filming at night must have reduced costs. You can infer the purposes of these changes. Did the actions of lawyer Nancy seem believable? Not to me. Was the 1956 version more believable? The idea of criminals taking over your home must be the worst nightmare of any family.

135961,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,079283495X,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 6]","When you see the name Anthony Hopkins you automatically think `good movie'.  I made that mistake before (with `Alexander' and `The Human Stain') and apparently I made that mistake again.  In fact, `Desperate Hours' is so bad that it actually made me question whether or not Anthony Hopkins is really a good actor.  Then again, you hear the name Michael Cimino and you recall the brilliance that was `The Deer Hunter' and you think `this has got to be good'.  Honestly, Cimino is probably the worst thing about this movie.  The films poor execution and lack of intelligence sucked all the charisma and charm and realism out of its cast and left us with a vapid and ridiculous waste of a free evening.The film follows escaped convict Michael as he breaks into Nora's home with his brother Wally and their criminal partner Albert.  Michael just needs a place to hold up until his girlfriend Nancy can meet up with him.  Nora has some problems of her own.  She is separated from her cheating husband Tim and is constantly fighting with him.  When Tim shows up at the house, as well as their two children May and Zack, the family becomes hostages fighting for their survival from these ruthless men.The plot is rather ridiculous as the character make decision after decision that no normal human being would make, and the script leaves no room for real tension within all the stupidity.  It's a shame, because I hear that the original film is actually very, very good, but this film was so horrid that I actually deleted the original off my DVR before I had a chance to watch it.Now I have to wait until it's reaired.The acting is a major sore spot here as well.  Like I said, you hear the name Anthony Hopkins and you think `great movie'.  He has a reputation for being a great actor.  He's won an Oscar and countless other awards and he's held with high esteem in the acting community.  That said; his performance here is atrocious.  Hopkins has this very calm and mannered delivery of lines that perfectly suits him for period films and somewhat pigeonholes him.  That delivery does not work well in this sort of movie.  Mimi Rogers is also somewhat out of her element, but I admit that I don't truly know what her element would be.  Elias Koteas is a mess, and David Morse (and actor I actually really enjoy) is just plain comical here.No one is as bad as Kelly Lynch, but I don't even want to get into that hot mess.Mickey Rourke is the only one that comes away with some dignity, but not much when you think about it.  In a way he just mimicked a better actor.  I dare you to watch his performance and not see Bruce Willis.  He talks like him, acts like him and even looks like him here.  They should have just gotten Willis himself; but perhaps he had better sense than to attach himself to this mess.  So, Rourke actually turns out a charismatic and interesting performance, but only because he's calling to mind another more talented actor.So in the end I cannot recommend this movie for any reason whatsoever because the movie is a total waste of time.  Like I said in my review title; only see this movie out of extreme desperation, and by extreme I mean like if you were Will Smith and the whole world was filled with flesh eating zombies and you only had a dog for a companion and the local video store was recently burnt down by the zombies and the only video that was left unscathed was `Desperate Hours'.  Then, and only then, should this movie be watched.Okay, that was kind of harsh.EDIT:  I just want to make it clear that I gave this movie ONE star...as in an F...yet it for some reason saved it as TWO stars...so, just know that I think this movie deserves ONE, not TWO stars...",2,Watch only out of desperation...,1225411200,"10 31, 2008",2008,3694,"['When', 'see', 'name', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'automatically', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'made', 'mistake', 'Alexander', 'Human', 'Stain', 'apparently', 'made', 'mistake', 'again', 'fact', 'Desperate', 'Hours', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'made', 'question', 'not', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'really', 'good', 'actor', 'Then', 'again', 'hear', 'name', 'Michael', 'Cimino', 'recall', 'brilliance', 'was', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'think', 'got', 'be', 'good', 'Honestly', 'Cimino', 'probably', 'worst', 'thing', 'movie', 'films', 'poor', 'execution', 'lack', 'intelligence', 'sucked', 'charisma', 'charm', 'realism', 'cast', 'left', 'vapid', 'ridiculous', 'waste', 'free', 'evening.The', 'film', 'escaped', 'convict', 'Michael', 'Nora', 'home', 'brother', 'Wally', 'criminal', 'partner', 'Albert', 'Michael', 'just', 'place', 'hold', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'Nancy', 'can', 'meet', 'up', 'Nora', 'problems', 'own', 'separated', 'cheating', 'husband', 'Tim', 'constantly', 'fighting', 'When', 'Tim', 'up', 'house', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'children', 'May', 'Zack', 'family', 'hostages', 'fighting', 'survival', 'ruthless', 'men.The', 'plot', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'character', 'make', 'decision', 'decision', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'would', 'make', 'script', 'room', 'real', 'tension', 'stupidity', 'shame', 'hear', 'original', 'film', 'actually', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'horrid', 'actually', 'deleted', 'original', 'DVR', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'it.Now', 'have', 'wait', 'reaired.The', 'acting', 'major', 'sore', 'spot', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'said', 'hear', 'name', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'think', 'great', 'movie', 'reputation', 'being', 'great', 'actor', 'won', 'Oscar', 'countless', 'other', 'awards', 'held', 'high', 'esteem', 'acting', 'community', 'said', 'performance', 'here', 'atrocious', 'very', 'calm', 'mannered', 'delivery', 'lines', 'perfectly', 'suits', 'period', 'films', 'somewhat', 'delivery', 'not', 'work', 'well', 'sort', 'movie', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'also', 'somewhat', 'element', 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'truly', 'know', 'what', 'element', 'would', 'be', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'mess', 'David', 'Morse', 'actor', 'actually', 'really', 'enjoy', 'just', 'plain', 'comical', 'here.No', 'one', 'as', 'bad', 'Kelly', 'Lynch', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'get', 'hot', 'mess.Mickey', 'Rourke', 'only', 'one', 'away', 'dignity', 'not', 'much', 'when', 'think', 'way', 'just', 'mimicked', 'better', 'actor', 'dare', 'watch', 'performance', 'not', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'acts', 'even', 'looks', 'here', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'gotten', 'Willis', 'perhaps', 'had', 'better', 'sense', 'attach', 'mess', 'So', 'Rourke', 'actually', 'out', 'charismatic', 'interesting', 'performance', 'only', 'calling', 'mind', 'more', 'talented', 'actor.So', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'movie', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'said', 'review', 'title', 'only', 'see', 'movie', 'extreme', 'desperation', 'extreme', 'mean', 'were', 'Will', 'Smith', 'whole', 'world', 'was', 'filled', 'flesh', 'eating', 'zombies', 'only', 'had', 'dog', 'companion', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'was', 'recently', 'burnt', 'down', 'zombies', 'only', 'video', 'was', 'left', 'unscathed', 'was', 'Desperate', 'Hours', 'Then', 'only', 'then', 'should', 'movie', 'be', 'watched.Okay', 'was', 'kind', 'harsh.EDIT', 'just', 'want', 'make', 'clear', 'gave', 'movie', 'ONE', 'star', 'F', 'yet', 'reason', 'saved', 'TWO', 'stars', 'so', 'just', 'know', 'think', 'movie', 'ONE', 'not', 'TWO', 'stars']",N/A
135962,A3IBYRSA490ZOA,079283495X,C. Chow,"[5, 6]","`Desperate Hours' calls us to question why do we do the things we do? Or rather why do these characters do the things they do? Neither the villains or heroes actions seem to make any sense.The plot: Mickey Rourke in the role he was born to play stars as a brilliant armed robber who escapes from prison with the help of his beautiful girlfriend and attorney Kelly Lynch.Rourke reunites with his henchmen whom are not as smart as the Three Stooges. Together they head for the suburbs of Utah and hold the state's only nuclear family, Anthony Hopkins, Mimi Rogers and their two kids hostage in their mansion.FBI agent Lindsey Crouse is hot on their trail with an army of cops to take Rourke down without harming the Hopkins family.Why it works. As I said Rourke truly gives the performance of his career and a hansom devil psycho. Hopkins and Rogers also work especially Rogers as the house wife next door. We really hate Rourke and we really love the family.The production quality is also very high. From costume design to photography to editing, to the score which is reminiscent of the 1940s noir thrillers on which the film was based. The production quality really is good enough to make the whole film worth while.The big flaw the film makers have to overcome is WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? Why is the now freed Rourke only exposing himself of more heat be kidnapping the family. While his stated motive is because he is waiting to reunite with Kelly Lynch, a far better idea would be to hide out unseen. Secondly why is Lynch leading to police right to Rourke's front door? Shouldn't she be hiding too? And if Rourke is so psychotically evil why does he not physically harm the family?That's the annoying thing. There are many lapses in logic. 1. Rourke escapes from a courthouse cell with Lynch's inner thigh pistol and disables the one single guard on duty.2. Lynch in police custody plans to pretend to be an innocent. Wouldn't she already be guilty of bringing a gun into the court house?3. Why is Rourke holding the family hostage if not to harm them?4. The hostages themselves are equally incompetent. They have many chances to escape and do not. Rourke even allows the teenage daughter to go out on a date with her boyfriend. I think most people would change their plans and give up a date save their family by going to the police.5. The police themselves are silly. They allow the apprehended Lynch to enter the house and warn Rourke of the hundreds of cops outside.6. The police rather than using sniper rifles use submachine guns at one point spraying the entire house with bullets with reckless disregard for the family. Yet they hit only one of the criminals.7. Another odd sequence of evens is when one of the gang is told to get rid of the corpse of the family's murdered Realtor. Was the basement full? Why draw more attention? The criminal draws attention to himself by driving erratically and takes to body out into the country. Instead of hiding he goes to the nearest gas station covered in blood asking for help. The first people he meets are Playmates. His lucky day but what are the odds? He then returns to the shallow grave where he is met by dozens of SWAT team members. How'd they get their so fast? And why are they just waiting around for him to show up?",5,Great Production and Acting Salvage Improbable Plot,1192579200,"10 17, 2007",2007,3281,"['Desperate', 'Hours', 'calls', 'question', 'why', 'do', 'do', 'things', 'do', 'rather', 'why', 'do', 'characters', 'do', 'things', 'do', 'villains', 'heroes', 'actions', 'seem', 'make', 'sense.The', 'plot', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'stars', 'brilliant', 'armed', 'robber', 'who', 'prison', 'help', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'attorney', 'Kelly', 'Lynch.Rourke', 'henchmen', 'whom', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'smart', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Together', 'head', 'suburbs', 'Utah', 'hold', 'state', 'only', 'nuclear', 'family', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'two', 'kids', 'hostage', 'mansion.FBI', 'agent', 'Lindsey', 'Crouse', 'hot', 'trail', 'army', 'cops', 'take', 'Rourke', 'down', 'harming', 'Hopkins', 'family.Why', 'said', 'Rourke', 'truly', 'performance', 'career', 'hansom', 'devil', 'psycho', 'Hopkins', 'Rogers', 'also', 'work', 'especially', 'Rogers', 'house', 'wife', 'next', 'door', 'really', 'hate', 'Rourke', 'really', 'love', 'family.The', 'production', 'quality', 'also', 'very', 'high', 'costume', 'design', 'photography', 'editing', 'score', 'reminiscent', '1940s', 'noir', 'thrillers', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'production', 'quality', 'really', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'whole', 'film', 'while.The', 'big', 'flaw', 'film', 'makers', 'have', 'overcome', 'WHY', 'IS', 'THIS', 'HAPPENING', 'Why', 'now', 'freed', 'Rourke', 'only', 'exposing', 'more', 'heat', 'be', 'kidnapping', 'family', 'stated', 'motive', 'waiting', 'reunite', 'Kelly', 'Lynch', 'far', 'better', 'idea', 'would', 'be', 'hide', 'out', 'unseen', 'Secondly', 'why', 'Lynch', 'leading', 'police', 'right', 'Rourke', 'front', 'door', 'Should', ""n't"", 'be', 'hiding', 'too', 'Rourke', 'so', 'psychotically', 'evil', 'why', 'not', 'physically', 'harm', 'family', 'annoying', 'thing', 'are', 'many', 'lapses', 'logic', '1', 'Rourke', 'courthouse', 'cell', 'Lynch', 'inner', 'thigh', 'pistol', 'one', 'single', 'guard', 'duty.2', 'Lynch', 'police', 'custody', 'pretend', 'be', 'innocent', 'Would', ""n't"", 'already', 'be', 'guilty', 'bringing', 'gun', 'court', 'house', '3', 'Why', 'Rourke', 'holding', 'family', 'hostage', 'not', 'harm', '4', 'hostages', 'are', 'equally', 'incompetent', 'have', 'many', 'chances', 'escape', 'do', 'not', 'Rourke', 'even', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'go', 'out', 'date', 'boyfriend', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'change', 'plans', 'give', 'up', 'date', 'save', 'family', 'going', 'police.5', 'police', 'are', 'silly', 'allow', 'apprehended', 'Lynch', 'enter', 'house', 'warn', 'Rourke', 'hundreds', 'cops', 'outside.6', 'police', 'rather', 'using', 'sniper', 'rifles', 'use', 'submachine', 'guns', 'one', 'point', 'spraying', 'entire', 'house', 'bullets', 'reckless', 'disregard', 'family', 'hit', 'only', 'one', 'criminals.7', 'odd', 'sequence', 'evens', 'when', 'one', 'gang', 'told', 'get', 'rid', 'corpse', 'family', 'murdered', 'Realtor', 'Was', 'basement', 'full', 'Why', 'draw', 'more', 'attention', 'criminal', 'draws', 'attention', 'driving', 'erratically', 'body', 'out', 'country', 'Instead', 'hiding', 'nearest', 'gas', 'station', 'covered', 'blood', 'asking', 'help', 'first', 'people', 'are', 'Playmates', 'lucky', 'day', 'are', 'odds', 'then', 'shallow', 'grave', 'where', 'met', 'dozens', 'SWAT', 'team', 'members', 'How', ""'d"", 'get', 'fast', 'why', 'are', 'just', 'waiting', 'around', 'show', 'up']",N/A

I think they could have picked a better lead detective and Kelly Lynch as the lawyer/fiance is confusing at times. In the beginning you see she's been brainwashed by this man and brings the gun in for him. Then things do a 180 as soon as she's questioned which they both knew the police would be watching her and inevitably lead them to Michael.

How has the suspense's concept altered for the new audiences?We know about the professed sympathy of Cimino for Rourke. We saw him in The year of the Dragon. And somehow Mickey doesn't look credible as the distorted mind criminal. He is too rational and cold to represent that hard character. The illumination is another serious problem. The whole drama looks extremely theatrical: Anthony Hopkins looks uncomfortable with the role and Mimi Rogers is inexpressive. Elias Koteas is simply out of context and perhaps that's why the insipid dialogue. Maybe David Morse shows certain wild tendency. There is a rigidity in the dialogue. Obviously you assist to the common places: the internal disagreements in the policy procedure. Lindsay Cruise is assertive in this role. But the initial sequence of the getaway is terrific. It looks too artificial and the viewer' adrenaline simply is not emanated. The sumptuous photography saves the film of the collapse. The music didn't help to maintain the suspense. It is not easy to readapt a classic film of the fifties. Something similar happened with Cape fear `s remake.The question might be around the new approach of the suspense and the new technologies.

135966,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,079283495X,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[15, 24]","If anyone was ever meant to bring the excessive, hugh productions of Andrew Lloyd Webber to the stage, its Michael Cimino.  With his grandiosque vision and tendency towards pushing his actors to give the broadest, most theatrical performances possible, Cimino is perhaps the greatest Opera director of our time.  Unfortunately, Cimino became a filmmaker instead and soon specialized in creating overblown, overbudget movies whose huge proudction values serve only to reveal their painfully slight stories.  Never has this been more obvious than his remake of the nail-biting 1955 film Desperate Hours (itself based on an acclaimed, often-revived play).  The plot is simple -- criminal Mickey Rourke escapes from prison and ends up hiding out in a suburban home while waiting for his girlfriend (Kelly Lynch) to meet him.  While he waits, he holds a dysfunctional family (Mimi Rogers, Shawnee Smith, and Anthony Hopkins) hostage.  This is the type of suspense thriller that demands an intimate touch so of course, Cimino shoots everything in wide screen so we can see how vast all of his locations are.  Seeing all that land out there, it makes you realize how easily any of the characters could escape if not for the fact that Cimino has two hours (actually more than two hours) to fill.At times, it seems that Cimino specifically tried to cast this film with the least suitable actors imaginable.  As such, we get perennial nice guy David Morse trying to be a threatening thug.  Daughter Shawnee Smith at one point says she's a pain because, &quot;I can be.&quot;  (No, Shawnee, its because Cimino can't be bothered to come up with anything more imaginative.)  Kelly Lynch sleepwalks through her role (and wanders around naked in scenes that would be titilating if not for how strangely pointless they are) while Mimi Rogers chews every piece of scenery available as a strident housewife who'll remind you why most people in the suburbs hate their neighbors.  Worst of all is federal marshall Lindsay Crouse who basically allows a steady stream of profanity, a big cast on her leg, and the worst Southern accent in a long line of bad Southern accents, serve as her performance.Still, as bad as the above mentioned are, Hopkins and Rourke are actually far worse because they actually could be acting if they wanted to.  Rourke's playing a sociopath so he whispers all of his line and adds a few extra helpings of gel to his hair.  Hopkins is a broken-down divorced Dad so he doesn't shave before his scenes.  I hope both of them did wonderful things with their paychecks because they certainly made filmgoers suffer for that money.Most bad films leave you feeling as if there actually was a good film hiding in there somewhere.  Desperate Hours leaves you feeling that there was indeed a good film and it was playing in the theater next door.

I figured since Anthony Hopkins and Mickey Rourke star in this, it must be a good movie, right?...well sort of. Mickey Rourke makes a slick believable sociopath, which in itself made this movie worth watching. I think Mickey Rourke was the essence of psychotic coolness back then along with Christian Slater in the late 80's.  Anthony Hopkin's acting was good, but nothing phenomenal.  Kelly Lynch is smoking hot in this film, even with her ridiculous 80's hairdo. She brought back fond short skirt memories of Roadhouse for me. :o)Here are some really comical scenes that weren't meant to be comical:One scene you see one of the wanted criminals dumping a body in the Utah Wilderness.  Next scene shows stock footage of a large buck wondering through the woods.. Ok, it's suddenly a nature film...too funny, talk about killing the killing mood.In another scene you see the same criminal, now totally covered in blood; looks like he just ate the deer with his bare hands... and he comes across two ""college girls"" parked at a gas station and one is using a payphone on the side of the road.  Ok, here we see the age of the film.. for one thing, the girl is using a payphone, not a cell phone and they are both wearing the most ridiculously short Daisy Dukes I've ever seen.  The two girls' shorts are so short and riding up that I had to chuckle. The bad guy drenched in blood tries to hitch a ride and casually asks ""What college do you girls go to?"" as a friendly ice breaker.  She tells him to F-off and runs into her truck and drives off, leaving her friend behind... too comical.  I swear this scene looks like something from a B movie in the early 70's.Here's another cheesy scene that added no value to the movie.  While the family is being held hostage the daughter's boyfriend calls wanting to go out and the bad guys idiotically let her talk to him on the phone. She tells him ""I'm busy"". He asks ""Why are you being such a bitch?"" and she snaps back ""Because I can be.""  Haha.. the classic bitch line, seriously outdated, but probably cool two decades ago...The ending scene after Mickey gets gunned down is so badly filmed and the music is so outdated, that alone made me want to burst out laughing.  The high powered butch semi-lesbo police captain with her deep male voice and average acting abilities limps off  screen in what is suppose to be a dramatic ending, but really quite pathetic.Ok, my caffeine high from too much coffee is wearing off, so this review must come to an end...",3,"Started strong, ended hilariously poorly",1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,2602,"['Ok', 'only', 'watched', '20', 'year', 'old', 'movie', 'share', 'boredom', 'finding', 'on-demand', 'xfinity', 'figured', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'star', 'must', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'right', 'well', 'sort', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'slick', 'believable', 'sociopath', 'made', 'movie', 'watching', 'think', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'was', 'essence', 'psychotic', 'coolness', 'back', 'then', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'late', '80', 'Anthony', 'Hopkin', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'nothing', 'phenomenal', 'Kelly', 'Lynch', 'smoking', 'hot', 'film', 'even', 'ridiculous', '80', 'hairdo', 'brought', 'back', 'fond', 'short', 'skirt', 'memories', 'Roadhouse', 'o', 'Here', 'are', 'really', 'comical', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'comical', 'One', 'scene', 'see', 'one', 'wanted', 'criminals', 'dumping', 'body', 'Utah', 'Wilderness', 'Next', 'scene', 'shows', 'stock', 'footage', 'large', 'buck', 'wondering', 'woods..', 'Ok', 'suddenly', 'nature', 'film', 'too', 'funny', 'talk', 'killing', 'killing', 'mood.In', 'scene', 'see', 'same', 'criminal', 'now', 'totally', 'covered', 'blood', 'just', 'ate', 'deer', 'bare', 'hands', 'two', 'college', 'girls', 'parked', 'gas', 'station', 'one', 'using', 'payphone', 'side', 'road', 'Ok', 'here', 'see', 'age', 'film..', 'one', 'thing', 'girl', 'using', 'payphone', 'not', 'cell', 'phone', 'are', 'wearing', 'most', 'ridiculously', 'short', 'Daisy', 'Dukes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'two', 'girls', 'shorts', 'are', 'so', 'short', 'riding', 'up', 'had', 'chuckle', 'bad', 'guy', 'drenched', 'blood', 'tries', 'hitch', 'ride', 'casually', 'What', 'college', 'do', 'girls', 'go', 'friendly', 'ice', 'breaker', 'F-off', 'truck', 'off', 'leaving', 'friend', 'too', 'comical', 'swear', 'scene', 'something', 'B', 'movie', 'early', ""70's.Here"", 'cheesy', 'scene', 'added', 'value', 'movie', 'family', 'being', 'held', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'wanting', 'go', 'out', 'bad', 'guys', 'idiotically', 'let', 'talk', 'phone', ""'m"", 'busy', 'Why', 'are', 'being', 'such', 'bitch', 'back', 'can', 'be', 'classic', 'bitch', 'line', 'seriously', 'outdated', 'probably', 'cool', 'two', 'decades', 'ending', 'scene', 'Mickey', 'gunned', 'down', 'so', 'badly', 'filmed', 'music', 'so', 'outdated', 'alone', 'made', 'want', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'high', 'powered', 'butch', 'semi-lesbo', 'police', 'captain', 'deep', 'male', 'voice', 'average', 'acting', 'abilities', 'limps', 'off', 'screen', 'what', 'suppose', 'be', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'really', 'quite', 'pathetic.Ok', 'caffeine', 'high', 'too', 'much', 'coffee', 'wearing', 'off', 'review', 'must', 'come', 'end']",N/A

Just wanted you to know that if you are looking for a pretty good film called ""The Desperate Hours,"" this is NOT the one you want to watch. You want to watch the 1955 version with Humphrey Bogart and Fredric March. This is the 1990 ""remake"" with Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins. The original is a taunt drama in which a man discovers that his home has been invaded and his family taken hostage by a trio of gangster escaped from prison and focuses on his desperate attempts to save their lives. This remake is exercise in terror in which the sadistic violence of the criminals becomes the driving force of the story and the goal is to see how far they will go before they are finally stopped. On paper you would have thought Anthony Hopkins could do a marvelous job in the role of the father, but the script pretty much makes that impossible. Turning the bad guy into a major league psychotic just destroys the psychological chess game that made the original so compelling. Rourke is simply the wrong choice for the role, always coming across as a sick punk rather than a criminal menace, but then few actors are going to be able to play against Hopkins, even when he is in low gear. I cannot believe anybody would watch this film twice; I only watched it because I was interested to see how they updated the original, the ending of which I just watched again on television. Of course the ending would be more violent, but it was the elegance of the ending of the original, as the hero saves his family with an unloaded gun, that made it stand out. This one is just a splatter flick dressed up a bit to fool you. Go check out the original because like Rourke's character, you do not want this in your house anywhere near your family.",2,"This version is a very bad ""remake"" of a very good film",1029628800,"08 18, 2002",2002,1762,"['Greetings', 'one', 'Just', 'wanted', 'know', 'are', 'looking', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'called', 'Desperate', 'Hours', 'NOT', 'one', 'want', 'watch', 'want', 'watch', '1955', 'version', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Fredric', 'March', '1990', 'remake', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'original', 'taunt', 'drama', 'man', 'home', 'been', 'invaded', 'family', 'taken', 'hostage', 'trio', 'gangster', 'escaped', 'prison', 'focuses', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'save', 'lives', 'remake', 'exercise', 'terror', 'sadistic', 'violence', 'criminals', 'driving', 'force', 'story', 'goal', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'are', 'finally', 'stopped', 'paper', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'could', 'do', 'marvelous', 'job', 'role', 'father', 'script', 'pretty', 'much', 'impossible', 'Turning', 'bad', 'guy', 'major', 'league', 'psychotic', 'just', 'psychological', 'chess', 'game', 'made', 'original', 'compelling', 'Rourke', 'simply', 'wrong', 'choice', 'role', 'always', 'coming', 'sick', 'punk', 'rather', 'criminal', 'menace', 'then', 'few', 'actors', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'Hopkins', 'even', 'when', 'low', 'gear', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'anybody', 'would', 'watch', 'film', 'twice', 'only', 'watched', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'updated', 'original', 'ending', 'just', 'watched', 'again', 'television', 'course', 'ending', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'violent', 'was', 'elegance', 'ending', 'original', 'hero', 'family', 'unloaded', 'gun', 'made', 'stand', 'out', 'one', 'just', 'splatter', 'flick', 'dressed', 'up', 'bit', 'fool', 'Go', 'check', 'original', 'Rourke', 'character', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'house', 'anywhere', 'family']",N/A

It's a map only the writer and the director could conceiveably read. The audience rarely knows where it is at any point in the story.A beautiful young attorney helps her lover / client to escape from jail. They try to make it look as though the woman was forced to help the guy. The police don't buy it, but decide to let her go, hoping she will lead them to the escapee.Meanwhile, bad boy and his two buddies decide to take refuge in a house in an upscale neighborhood and to hold the family living there hostage. As if the poor family didn't have enough problems already! The husband and wife are in the middle of a hostile divorce, the house is for sale, and neither the couple nor their two kids wants to be in the house in the first place.The bad guy is supposed to have a genius IQ, so why does he come up with such an idiotic plan? There's no real reason to terrorize the family, except that there'd be no movie if he didn't. But even in the confines of the house, there's no rational to his actions. [I can't say more without using plot spoilers.] The only characters who are dumber than this guy are the cops. Their plans and actions truly defy belief and only serve to add a lot of gratuitous violence.Aside from the silly script, the movie also fails as a thriller because the camera leaves the house too often to cover events occurring elsewhere.

135978,A220FJEQNGMSRN,079283495X,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 1]","With superb performances from Frederic March, Humphrey Bogart and Arthur Kennedy, a taut script and on the money direction from William Wyler, The Desperate Hours is one of the great thrillers of all time. Unfortunately, this is Desperate Hours, one of the worst films of the nineties, or any other decade for that matter.The first 15 minutes are great: tight, controlled and fairly convincing, with a surprisingly on-form Mickey Rourke. It doesn't last. As soon as he and his fellow unstable escaped murderers hide out in the home of Anthony Hopkins and Mimi Rogers' dysfunctional family it goes down the toilet faster than bleach. Logic is quickly abandoned, there are some dazzlingly obvious continuity errors and before long you feel almost as much a hostage as the truly obnoxious family themselves.Mickey Rourke is initially very good, but the performance is not properly thought through and falls to pieces around the halfway mark. Hopkins, the most ridiculous Vietnam vet the screen has yet produced, is just appalling, Crouse bullish and one note while Kelly Lynch displays her breasts at every available opportunity - even in the opening jailbreak! - and to heck with logic or necessity.With Desperate Hours, Michael Cimino finally made a film as bad as Heaven's Gate was supposed to be (but wasn't). Actually make that two, if you include The Sicilian. On the plus side, David Mansfield's score is very good indeed. Nothing else is. Avoid.",1,Cimino's worst movie,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,1450,"['superb', 'performances', 'Frederic', 'March', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Arthur', 'Kennedy', 'taut', 'script', 'money', 'direction', 'William', 'Wyler', 'Desperate', 'Hours', 'one', 'great', 'thrillers', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'Desperate', 'Hours', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'nineties', 'other', 'decade', 'matter.The', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'are', 'great', 'tight', 'controlled', 'fairly', 'convincing', 'surprisingly', 'on-form', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', ""n't"", 'last', 'As', 'soon', 'fellow', 'unstable', 'escaped', 'murderers', 'hide', 'out', 'home', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'down', 'toilet', 'faster', 'bleach', 'Logic', 'quickly', 'abandoned', 'are', 'dazzlingly', 'obvious', 'continuity', 'errors', 'long', 'feel', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'hostage', 'truly', 'obnoxious', 'family', 'themselves.Mickey', 'Rourke', 'initially', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'not', 'properly', 'thought', 'falls', 'pieces', 'halfway', 'mark', 'Hopkins', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'Vietnam', 'screen', 'yet', 'produced', 'just', 'appalling', 'Crouse', 'bullish', 'one', 'note', 'Kelly', 'Lynch', 'breasts', 'available', 'opportunity', 'even', 'opening', 'jailbreak', 'heck', 'logic', 'necessity.With', 'Desperate', 'Hours', 'Michael', 'Cimino', 'finally', 'made', 'film', 'as', 'bad', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'was', ""n't"", 'Actually', 'make', 'two', 'include', 'Sicilian', 'plus', 'side', 'David', 'Mansfield', 'score', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'Nothing', 'else', 'Avoid']",N/A
