1041206,A1K31NF81TS0CO,B000LXGXWK,"Dubyac99 ""Dubyac99""","[0, 4]","A very nice season, and a great ending to a wonderful show.  Funky last show, I truly believe that it was a last minute decision to cancel this season.  The end felt funky.  Bert marrying Agnes seemed off kilter and silly, and not in range of immature Herbert's normal behavior.  He may be a mesh, but he's not milque toast.Why did a ""family reunion"" for Herbert entail his entire family coming to him?  If they were so self-centered, why would they be willing to travel 3,000 miles to see him?  Why didn't the reunion occur near where the majority of the attendees live?  This was completely illogical.  Especially considering the way they (his family) were described by Herbert himself.  Anyone else find this illogical?  The writers should have written it, to have Herbert travel to New York instead.Also, when Herbert got married, nobody from his family came to the wedding?  Or was it because they all had just come the week before, and didn't have enough for airfare?  Stupid!  And we're supposed to believe MacGillicuddy, Herbert's arch nemesis, came to his wedding (was even invited?) and was one of his best men?  Now that's very hard to believe  Why not make the ""extra's"" guests, people supposedly from Herbert's family?  Why was everyone in the office automatically invited to the wedding?  And even if they were invited, why did they automatically have time to attend?On a positive note, it was funny seeing the ""Big Ragu"" from ""Laverne and Shirley"" fame as the ""heavy.""  Funny stuff!And about the office crew.  Did you notice that the co-workers in the office, NEVER changed the whole five year run of this show?  I'd love to get in touch with the HR staff and turn-over crew at this office to learn their secrets.  Hell, even office jobs in real life have horrendous turnover problems, employees rarely staying longer than two years.  It would have been nice to see some different folks, around the office, some fresh blood.But I can't believe not one other reviewer hasn't questioned the audacity of this show to do this?  Why only 13 shows in the season?  Come on!  Ridiculous!  13 shows?  You're kidding me?  NOT ACCEPTABLE!  Incomplete!!!  My professors dropped the grade one level, for incompletes.  Well, I'm dropping my rating 1 star for this atrocity!  4.5 starts drops to 3.5.  And 1/2 star drop for shaky set ups and plots.On a positive note, this season was much better than season 4, and certainly gave season 3 a run for its money.  Too bad they cancelled it, seemingly unknown to the stars.  I know the set up in the last show of the season was an act, very much like all the other times they broke the 4th wall, and talked directly to the audience.Many would argue that Moonlighting fought against the low number of episodes, with unique and ""living outside of the box"" acting and writing.  I can think of plenty of other shows that did this, and still managed to get 20 - 28 shows per season.  13 is far, far too few!'nuff said.MC White said:  Very good, too bad too short!",3,Why only 13 episodes?...,1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,3004,"['very', 'nice', 'season', 'great', 'ending', 'wonderful', 'show', 'Funky', 'last', 'show', 'truly', 'believe', 'was', 'last', 'minute', 'decision', 'cancel', 'season', 'end', 'felt', 'funky', 'Bert', 'marrying', 'Agnes', 'seemed', 'off', 'kilter', 'silly', 'not', 'range', 'immature', 'Herbert', 'normal', 'behavior', 'may', 'be', 'mesh', 'not', 'milque', 'toast.Why', 'did', 'family', 'reunion', 'Herbert', 'entail', 'entire', 'family', 'coming', 'were', 'so', 'self-centered', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'travel', '3,000', 'miles', 'see', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'reunion', 'occur', 'where', 'majority', 'attendees', 'live', 'was', 'completely', 'illogical', 'Especially', 'considering', 'way', 'family', 'were', 'described', 'Herbert', 'Anyone', 'else', 'find', 'illogical', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'written', 'have', 'Herbert', 'travel', 'New', 'York', 'instead.Also', 'when', 'Herbert', 'got', 'married', 'nobody', 'family', 'came', 'wedding', 'was', 'had', 'just', 'come', 'week', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'airfare', 'Stupid', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'MacGillicuddy', 'Herbert', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'came', 'wedding', 'was', 'even', 'invited', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'men', 'Now', 'very', 'hard', 'believe', 'Why', 'not', 'make', 'extra', 'guests', 'people', 'supposedly', 'Herbert', 'family', 'Why', 'was', 'everyone', 'office', 'automatically', 'invited', 'wedding', 'even', 'were', 'invited', 'why', 'did', 'automatically', 'have', 'time', 'attend', 'positive', 'note', 'was', 'funny', 'seeing', 'Big', 'Ragu', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'fame', 'heavy', 'Funny', 'stuff', 'office', 'crew', 'Did', 'notice', 'co-workers', 'office', 'NEVER', 'changed', 'whole', 'five', 'year', 'run', 'show', ""'d"", 'love', 'get', 'touch', 'HR', 'staff', 'turn-over', 'crew', 'office', 'learn', 'secrets', 'Hell', 'even', 'office', 'jobs', 'real', 'life', 'have', 'horrendous', 'turnover', 'problems', 'employees', 'rarely', 'staying', 'longer', 'two', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'different', 'folks', 'office', 'fresh', 'blood.But', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'not', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', ""n't"", 'questioned', 'audacity', 'show', 'do', 'Why', 'only', '13', 'shows', 'season', 'Come', 'Ridiculous', '13', 'shows', ""'re"", 'kidding', 'NOT', 'ACCEPTABLE', 'Incomplete', 'professors', 'dropped', 'grade', 'one', 'level', 'incompletes', 'Well', ""'m"", 'dropping', 'rating', '1', 'star', 'atrocity', '4.5', 'starts', 'drops', '3.5', '1/2', 'star', 'drop', 'shaky', 'set', 'ups', 'plots.On', 'positive', 'note', 'season', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'season', '4', 'certainly', 'gave', 'season', '3', 'run', 'money', 'bad', 'cancelled', 'seemingly', 'unknown', 'stars', 'know', 'set', 'up', 'last', 'show', 'season', 'was', 'act', 'very', 'much', 'other', 'times', 'broke', '4th', 'wall', 'talked', 'directly', 'audience.Many', 'would', 'argue', 'Moonlighting', 'fought', 'low', 'number', 'episodes', 'unique', 'living', 'outside', 'box', 'acting', 'writing', 'can', 'think', 'plenty', 'other', 'shows', 'did', 'still', 'managed', 'get', '20', '28', 'shows', 'season', '13', 'far', 'far', 'too', 'few', 'said.MC', 'White', 'said', 'Very', 'good', 'too', 'bad', 'too', 'short']",Moonlighting: Season 5 - The Final Season

1041214,AEGQWVR6KWBV,B000LXGXWK,"Ron Cronovich ""Ron""","[26, 26]","The 5th season was an odd season for Moonlighting.  Many fans berate season 4 for keeping David and Maddie apart so long.  But at least David still loved Maddie, and in pursuit of her went through many trials (prison, lemaze classes, parenting books, Maddie's father).  At the end of Season 4, we learn Maddie still loves David.Season 5 starts strong with Womb with a View, which revisits the connection between them.  In the following episodes, though, there's no connection or chemistry.  There's Maddie pulling away, and David feeling dejected and eventually pulling away.  In an odd way, these episodes are reminiscent of Season 1, before anything ever happened between D & M.  Except for the white elephant in the room:  they hardly even acknowledge their former intense feelings for each other.  These middle episodes have a few pleasant moments and some classic Moonlighting comedy bits.  But truthfully, getting through them was a bit of a chore, they only remind you of how great Moonlighting was when there was real tension and passion between D & M.Things look up in the last few episodes, when David meets Maddie's cousin Anne.  It seems Maddie is finally over David, though it's not clear he's over her.  We wonder if he's using Anne to get back at Maddie for moving on, something that would be despicable.  Or maybe David is genuinely happy, maybe this new relationship is the healthy, stable, loving relationship he never had with Maddie.  In the end, David once again sacrifices his own well-being for someone else (as we -- but not Maddie -- saw him do so often in Season 4).Lunar Eclipse ends with a funny wedding, and then our beloved friends (and we loyal viewers) have to come to grips with their fate.

The beginning-of-the-end began with the mistake of the ""consumation"" twist--coupled with the unpleasant, ubiquitous, overbearing presence of the incredibly charmless, irritating and humorless Curtis Armstrong.  MOONLIGHTING became a turgid mellodrama consisting mainly of the wallowing Bruce Willis' tedious, nauseating EMOTING. I managed to get through half of season four, but then, broken-hearted, I couldn't bear it anymore. HOWEVER--WhoKnew that in the last season they came to their senses and made an attempt to return to the original delightful premise/atmosphere. They wisely put the dreary Sturm und Drang on the back-burner and tried to recapture the Magic that had completely dissapeared. In this last season we're taken back to the original Blue Moon Detective Agency with Maddie and David solving bizarre ""cases"" with wonderful humor and repartee.
