You get out of your truck because it quit running.  You see a tornado coming towards you.  And you get back in your truck and try starting it again?  No go, then take off running down the road still directly in its path.  I guess that speaks to the writing and not the acting.  Still, I liked this movie.  I continue to search for another first rate movie like Night of the Twisters.

It was kind of slow and lame in a few spots, But to me the real story stands out. I have been thru a few Tornadoes in my day and I take the warnings seriously.
