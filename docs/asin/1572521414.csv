It's a terribly European film in style (no bad thing).  It relies primarily on dialogue and even more on extended monologue, not action, to tell its story.  The story might seem sordid - but is it?  Its glory is  that it lays bare the yearning at the core of human existence.  Its tragedy is that the two people most concerned don't believe,  having found in each other a solace for that yearning, that their solace has a hope in the world they live in. The film itself makes very little comment on its content, nor will it provide you any ready-made moral ""answers"".  It won't do a bit of your thinking for you.  But watch it - and reflect. It may stretch your heart - and God knows, the world needs that.",4,It will push your boundaries - which is an added plus!,923270400,"04 5, 1999",1999,814,"['film', 'French-Canadian', 'patois', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'willing', 'deal', 'subtitles', 'Do', 'so', 'please', 'terribly', 'European', 'film', 'style', 'bad', 'thing', 'primarily', 'dialogue', 'even', 'more', 'extended', 'monologue', 'not', 'action', 'tell', 'story', 'story', 'might', 'seem', 'sordid', 'glory', 'yearning', 'core', 'human', 'existence', 'tragedy', 'two', 'people', 'most', 'concerned', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'having', 'found', 'other', 'solace', 'yearning', 'solace', 'hope', 'world', 'live', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'comment', 'content', 'will', 'provide', 'ready-made', 'moral', 'answers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'bit', 'thinking', 'watch', 'reflect', 'may', 'stretch', 'heart', 'God', 'world']",N/A
185973,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,1572521414,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","This Canadian film in Montreal, in the local lingua, is luckily subtitled otherwise no one could understand it except the small minority of people who can speak the local French-like dialect. And that would be a shame because it is a great film.A young man, Yves, is confronted to a police inspector who is trying to understand the crime for which this young man summoned the police, accusing himself of a murder. He summoned the police in the chambers of a judge, hence using keys he had and should not have, and after informing the local press of the situation. When we know Yves is a hustler the judge's chambers' keys in his possession become understandable though disturbing if it becomes public. The presence of the press outside makes the whole thing appear as an attempt to blackmail a judge.But we know about the murder because we saw it in black and white at the beginning. The problem, for us as much as for the police inspector, is to understand why it happened, and only the murderer can tell us.The situation yet is disquieting. Claude, the lover who hired the hustler, is a student at the university, is supposed to be heterosexual, has a girlfriend in Quebec where he is from, etc. Yet it is obvious the crime is a sex crime and it took place while a sex act was being performed and this sex act was absolutely consensual. So why did the hustler kill the customer?Yves finally cracks up or breaks down and starts telling his story. And that's when it becomes very disturbing.Yves fell in love with Claude who had fallen in love before him. How can a hustler be in love with his customer? How can a customer be in love with a hustler? The relation becomes habitual. It lasts and that is the troublesome element. It becomes a real love affair. A normal hustler would take the money and do his job but will not fall in love. If he did he would at once move on and drop the adventure that would become a caper. Too dangerous. Yves did not and even experienced extreme happiness when he and Claude experienced extreme ecstasy, total communication in pleasure, full sharing of physical, mental and emotional orgasm.And that's the rub.Yves loves Claude so much and Claude loves Yves so much that Yves realizes there will be a difficult moment when Claude will have to face the fact that he is gay in a society and an environment that is not necessarily tolerant about it, and for Yves the love and pleasure he experiences with Claude would become bitter and hateful when the real situation is found out and made public for both of them. Yves wants Claude to live forever in his pleasure and he wants to face his fate, and his end if necessary, with Claude in him, pregnant with Claude and his love in a way.That's why in the trance of his pleasure and orgasm shared with the pleasure and orgasm of Claude, he kills Claude for him to fully remain forever in this state and for himself to inherit this living pleasure inside his own self.Yves is motivated by the ""peur de l'autre bord de la m&eacute;daille"", the other side of the coin Claude will have to face one day. He wants Claude to die in his pleasure, to die of pleasure, not seeing the perversion that Claude does not DIE, but IS KILLED, hence not OF pleasure but WITHIN pleasure. And yet that is love. To love someone to the point of offering that one to die of pleasure and live in me till my real death comes.And there again there is something perverted. The offering to pleasure would be complete if Yves offered himself to his own pleasure containing the pleasure of Claude now dead. Instead of killing himself on top of Claude he has just killed, he runs away and around for two days and finally calls the police and sets up a strange confession cession.But it is such a beautiful film about love when it is turned into a merchandize and when life turns it back into a passion. Love cannot be both an emotion and a commodity. As an emotion and a passion it is beautiful. As a commodity it would be vain, aimless and frustrating. That latter choice can only be for a short while and then it has to be terminated or it will turn sour, bitter, hateful, dangerous.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,To be in love till death ensues,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,4153,"['Canadian', 'film', 'Montreal', 'local', 'lingua', 'luckily', 'subtitled', 'otherwise', 'one', 'could', 'understand', 'small', 'minority', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'speak', 'local', 'French-like', 'dialect', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'great', 'film.A', 'young', 'man', 'confronted', 'police', 'inspector', 'who', 'trying', 'understand', 'crime', 'young', 'man', 'summoned', 'police', 'accusing', 'murder', 'summoned', 'police', 'chambers', 'judge', 'hence', 'using', 'keys', 'had', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'informing', 'local', 'press', 'situation', 'When', 'know', 'hustler', 'judge', 'chambers', 'keys', 'possession', 'become', 'understandable', 'disturbing', 'public', 'presence', 'press', 'whole', 'thing', 'appear', 'attempt', 'blackmail', 'judge.But', 'know', 'murder', 'saw', 'black', 'white', 'beginning', 'problem', 'as', 'much', 'police', 'inspector', 'understand', 'why', 'happened', 'only', 'murderer', 'can', 'tell', 'us.The', 'situation', 'yet', 'disquieting', 'Claude', 'lover', 'who', 'hired', 'hustler', 'student', 'university', 'supposed', 'be', 'heterosexual', 'girlfriend', 'Quebec', 'where', 'etc', 'obvious', 'crime', 'sex', 'crime', 'took', 'place', 'sex', 'act', 'was', 'being', 'performed', 'sex', 'act', 'was', 'absolutely', 'consensual', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'hustler', 'kill', 'customer', 'finally', 'up', 'breaks', 'down', 'telling', 'story', 'when', 'very', 'disturbing.Yves', 'fell', 'love', 'Claude', 'who', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'How', 'can', 'hustler', 'be', 'love', 'customer', 'How', 'can', 'customer', 'be', 'love', 'hustler', 'relation', 'habitual', 'troublesome', 'element', 'real', 'love', 'affair', 'normal', 'hustler', 'would', 'take', 'money', 'do', 'job', 'will', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'did', 'would', 'once', 'move', 'drop', 'adventure', 'would', 'become', 'caper', 'Too', 'dangerous', 'Yves', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'experienced', 'extreme', 'happiness', 'when', 'Claude', 'experienced', 'extreme', 'ecstasy', 'total', 'communication', 'pleasure', 'full', 'sharing', 'physical', 'mental', 'emotional', 'orgasm.And', 'rub.Yves', 'Claude', 'so', 'much', 'Claude', 'so', 'much', 'realizes', 'will', 'be', 'difficult', 'moment', 'when', 'Claude', 'will', 'have', 'face', 'fact', 'gay', 'society', 'environment', 'not', 'necessarily', 'tolerant', 'love', 'pleasure', 'Claude', 'would', 'become', 'bitter', 'hateful', 'when', 'real', 'situation', 'found', 'made', 'public', 'Claude', 'live', 'forever', 'pleasure', 'face', 'fate', 'end', 'necessary', 'Claude', 'pregnant', 'Claude', 'love', 'way.That', 'why', 'trance', 'pleasure', 'orgasm', 'shared', 'pleasure', 'orgasm', 'Claude', 'Claude', 'fully', 'remain', 'forever', 'state', 'inherit', 'living', 'pleasure', 'own', 'self.Yves', 'motivated', 'peur', ""l'autre"", 'bord', 'la', 'm', 'eacute', 'daille', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'Claude', 'will', 'have', 'face', 'one', 'day', 'Claude', 'die', 'pleasure', 'die', 'pleasure', 'not', 'seeing', 'perversion', 'Claude', 'not', 'DIE', 'IS', 'KILLED', 'hence', 'not', 'OF', 'pleasure', 'WITHIN', 'pleasure', 'yet', 'love', 'love', 'someone', 'point', 'offering', 'one', 'die', 'pleasure', 'live', 'till', 'real', 'death', 'comes.And', 'there', 'again', 'something', 'perverted', 'offering', 'pleasure', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'Yves', 'offered', 'own', 'pleasure', 'containing', 'pleasure', 'Claude', 'now', 'dead', 'Instead', 'killing', 'top', 'Claude', 'just', 'killed', 'away', 'two', 'days', 'finally', 'police', 'up', 'strange', 'confession', 'cession.But', 'such', 'beautiful', 'film', 'love', 'when', 'turned', 'merchandize', 'when', 'life', 'back', 'passion', 'Love', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'emotion', 'commodity', 'emotion', 'passion', 'beautiful', 'commodity', 'would', 'be', 'vain', 'aimless', 'frustrating', 'latter', 'choice', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'short', 'while', 'then', 'be', 'terminated', 'will', 'turn', 'sour', 'bitter', 'hateful', 'dangerous.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

I'm sure this is not the first film about killing the one you love... and It will not be the last. Mr. GoodBar comes to mind, but he was just a nut out to get his jollies at the right moment.As Yves tells the inspector,'you cannot explain it in words, it doesn't work, the feelings cannot be described as one thinks them'.You have to draw on your imagination to get to the agonizing and hopelessness of Yves demented love for claude.We do not get to have a deeper evaluation of Claude's psyche. P>Halfway decent gay themed movies are hard to find, and I cannot imagine what Hollywood would have done with this flick, but, if you can take the heavy darkness of this movie it will leave you thinking, about the obsessions of love and how it can deform your psyche.
