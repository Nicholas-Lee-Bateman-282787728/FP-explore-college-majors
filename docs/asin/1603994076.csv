I laughed and still gush over &#34;Sam&#34; Jennie Kwan in every episode. I feel like a kid again watching these. Some episodes were a little weird, like the episode with Tony & his friend from the &#34;Hood&#34; who acted a bit suspect. Lol, but other than that, I thought it was a great episode and the message was well received and understood. I have no complaints about the show at all, just wished they had a few more features, like behind the scenes or bloopers. I hope that once they release season 5 all that will be on there and more. I have seasons 1-3 so far and going to buy season four a bit later. Great buy for anyone who loved the series and enjoyed the hope and innocence of the 90's.",5,California Dreams...don't wake me up if i'm dreaming,1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,834,"['received', 'DVD', 'other', 'day', 'season', 'three', 'great', 'look', 'back', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'hope', 'show', 'gave', 'child', 'laughed', 'still', 'gush', 'over', '34', 'Sam', '34', 'Jennie', 'Kwan', 'episode', 'feel', 'kid', 'again', 'watching', 'episodes', 'were', 'little', 'weird', 'episode', 'Tony', 'friend', '34', 'Hood', '34', 'who', 'acted', 'bit', 'suspect', 'Lol', 'other', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'episode', 'message', 'was', 'well', 'received', 'understood', 'have', 'complaints', 'show', 'just', 'wished', 'had', 'few', 'more', 'features', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'hope', 'once', 'release', 'season', '5', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'have', 'seasons', '1-3', 'so', 'far', 'going', 'buy', 'season', 'four', 'bit', 'later', 'Great', 'buy', 'anyone', 'who', 'loved', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'hope', 'innocence', '90']",N/A

193365,A2BE3MTUT0YBF0,1603994076,"Michael Griswold ""Michael Griswold""","[4, 4]","Season Three of California Dreams experienced a great deal with the departure of Matt Garrison (Brent Gore) and the arrival of Lorena and Mark. But the episodes of season three gravitated towards more serious issues like steroid use and smoking and characters began to add depth as the viewer saw that Sly was not absolutely shallow and money consumed in the episodes where he dates Allison a blind girl played brilliantly by Nikki Cox. With all this being said, despite the turn towards becoming a more moralistic and edgy show there's still plenty of fun episodes from the laid back crew of California Dreams. There are no extras other than the video jukeboxes featured on every disk, but Shout Factory has a limited budget on these titles and I think most longtime Dreams fans although perhaps wanting more extras will take the trade off to have episodes on the DVD since it hasn't been syndicated in years.",5,The Dreams They are a Changing,1299888000,"03 12, 2011",2011,910,"['Season', 'Three', 'California', 'Dreams', 'experienced', 'great', 'deal', 'departure', 'Matt', 'Garrison', 'Brent', 'Gore', 'arrival', 'Lorena', 'Mark', 'episodes', 'season', 'three', 'gravitated', 'towards', 'more', 'serious', 'issues', 'steroid', 'use', 'smoking', 'characters', 'began', 'add', 'depth', 'viewer', 'saw', 'Sly', 'was', 'not', 'absolutely', 'shallow', 'money', 'consumed', 'episodes', 'where', 'Allison', 'blind', 'girl', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Nikki', 'Cox', 'being', 'said', 'turn', 'towards', 'becoming', 'more', 'moralistic', 'edgy', 'show', 'still', 'plenty', 'fun', 'episodes', 'laid', 'back', 'crew', 'California', 'Dreams', 'are', 'extras', 'other', 'video', 'jukeboxes', 'featured', 'disk', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'limited', 'budget', 'titles', 'think', 'most', 'longtime', 'Dreams', 'fans', 'perhaps', 'wanting', 'more', 'extras', 'will', 'take', 'trade', 'have', 'episodes', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'been', 'syndicated', 'years']",N/A
