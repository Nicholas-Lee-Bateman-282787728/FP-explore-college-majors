This film is heartwarming, romantic, and inspiring. Despite the subject matter it is not a heavy movie. The majority of the film is very upbeat, even humorous, at times. Yvette Mimieux gives an endearing performance as the sweet, joyfull and childlike Clara Johnson. Olivia de Havilland is very convincing as her loving but conflicted mother, Meg. And a young George Hamilton delivers what is perhaps his finest performance ever, as the charming and sensitive Italian boy, Fabrizio, who falls madly in love with Clara.

1503042,A3DDPQ9342UNMY,B005SYZZ9E,"N. Doyle ""film buff""","[6, 6]","I have just seen the REMASTERED EDITION (from Warner Archives) of the recent DVD for LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA which came out a few months ago.Olivia de Havilland is a worried mother travelling through scenic Italian locations with daughter Yvette Mimieux, who is mentally retarded. When a young Italian starts courting her daughter and showing up in the most unlikely places, de Havilland's predicament becomes apparent. Should she tell the truth or let her daughter marry the rather simple-minded Italian boy? It's a predicament that is nicely solved by the time we get to the fadeout with de Havilland declaring: ""I did the right thing...I know I did.""Under Guy Green's direction, and photographed with gorgeous images of Italy's landmarks in Rome and Florence, the latest DVD transfer of ""Light in the Piazza"" is a sight to behold. And the intimate story of a mother's wish to find happiness for her daughter rather than giving in to the idea of shutting her away, is told with a good deal of humor and charm thanks to splendid performances from the stars and an intelligent script.The Epstein brothers have given the screenplay some grace and humor--and de Havilland is superb as the doting mother. Rosanno Brazzi adds his brand of charm to the boy's father and there is a light touch of romance between him and de Havilland.George Hamilton is surprisingly convincing and utterly charming as the smitten Italian youth, Yvette Mimieux shines as the girl and Barry Sullivan does what he can with the thankless role of her stubborn father who would rather see her placed in an institution. All of it is nicely photographed in Italian locales and in wide-screen Technicolor (see the letterbox version if you can).This unappreciated film is a minor gem--poignant, touching and humorous. Olivia de Havilland, decked out in a Christian Dior wardrobe, is very attractive in one of her best mature roles. Her chemistry with Rossano Brazzi is so strong that you wish more had been made of the romantic feelings developing between them, but all of their scenes together are expertly played with fine nuances.Like fine wine, it gets better with time.",5,Like fine wine...a film that gets better with time...,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,2137,"['have', 'just', 'seen', 'REMASTERED', 'EDITION', 'Warner', 'Archives', 'recent', 'DVD', 'LIGHT', 'IN', 'THE', 'PIAZZA', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'months', 'de', 'Havilland', 'worried', 'mother', 'travelling', 'scenic', 'Italian', 'locations', 'daughter', 'Yvette', 'Mimieux', 'who', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'When', 'young', 'Italian', 'courting', 'daughter', 'showing', 'up', 'most', 'unlikely', 'places', 'de', 'Havilland', 'predicament', 'apparent', 'Should', 'tell', 'truth', 'let', 'daughter', 'marry', 'rather', 'simple-minded', 'Italian', 'boy', 'predicament', 'nicely', 'solved', 'time', 'get', 'fadeout', 'de', 'Havilland', 'declaring', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'know', 'did', 'Guy', 'Green', 'direction', 'photographed', 'gorgeous', 'images', 'Italy', 'landmarks', 'Rome', 'Florence', 'latest', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'Light', 'Piazza', 'sight', 'behold', 'intimate', 'story', 'mother', 'wish', 'find', 'happiness', 'daughter', 'rather', 'giving', 'idea', 'shutting', 'away', 'told', 'good', 'deal', 'humor', 'charm', 'thanks', 'splendid', 'performances', 'stars', 'intelligent', 'script.The', 'Epstein', 'brothers', 'have', 'given', 'screenplay', 'grace', 'humor', 'Havilland', 'superb', 'doting', 'mother', 'Rosanno', 'Brazzi', 'brand', 'charm', 'boy', 'father', 'light', 'touch', 'romance', 'de', 'Havilland.George', 'Hamilton', 'surprisingly', 'convincing', 'utterly', 'charming', 'smitten', 'Italian', 'youth', 'Yvette', 'Mimieux', 'shines', 'girl', 'Barry', 'Sullivan', 'what', 'can', 'thankless', 'role', 'stubborn', 'father', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'placed', 'institution', 'nicely', 'photographed', 'Italian', 'locales', 'wide-screen', 'Technicolor', 'see', 'letterbox', 'version', 'can', '.This', 'unappreciated', 'film', 'minor', 'gem', 'poignant', 'touching', 'humorous', 'Olivia', 'Havilland', 'decked', 'out', 'Christian', 'Dior', 'wardrobe', 'very', 'attractive', 'one', 'best', 'mature', 'roles', 'chemistry', 'Rossano', 'Brazzi', 'so', 'strong', 'wish', 'more', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'romantic', 'feelings', 'developing', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'expertly', 'played', 'fine', 'nuances.Like', 'fine', 'wine', 'better', 'time']",Light in the Piazza

I'm as familiar with 40's Bette Davis as I am with Lars Von Trier (thanks TCM).  And so after all these stories and directors and years of research ---- I've discovered two of my favorite films are by a director I had never heard of.  That likely goes for you too.  His name is Guy Green.  His two best I've seen are Sidney Poitier's A PATCH OF BLUE and the charming feature LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA.  Both stories are about a young love... an impossible love... where love conquers all.  Sure, old school melodrama, but if the very words 'Harry Potter' make you sick at modern cinema, you've just found two gems for your jewelry box.I won't say anything more about this movie but to say it's the type of movie you can watch with a child or grandmother in the room and never flinch once.  That said, it's charming beyond words, and wall to wall eye and heart candy.  Don't fear it's some sappy Hallmark Hall Of Fame silliness.  There are adult issues... and they're handled in an admirably adult way.The reason I offer this new 'remastered' DVD only 3.7 stars is that it isn't remastered in the slightest.  If I'm wrong, if it actually is remastered, the original print must have been used toilet paper.  This faded speckled mess of a print is an education in the difference between remastering and restoring a classic film.LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA is not only deserving of a restoration... but a re-release.
