569681,A3PAMMMH9F56K9,B000056MMA,Giacomo C.,"[4, 6]","Much in this production promised well, but alas this promise goes unfulfilled...The film has a fairly strong sense of style that is kept up throughout, but is lacking in substance.  The plain fact of the matter is that I was rather bored with it - from beginning to end.  Yes, there were some good things, but these were just not enough to chase away the strong sense of ennui...  which is remarkable considering that there is so much going on that really SHOULD have been interesting...As just about all the othe reviews have mentioned, the animation is dated though it certainly must have seemed impressive at the time (which was only 1989 - surprising how much the average quality level of anime in general has gone up in the following decade).In the sound department, there is a fairly nice stereo soundstage for the effects.  The music on the other hand left much to be desired - including some unfortunate testaments to the quality of 80s synthesizers (may they rest in pieces!).In conclusion, this effort was simply wanting.  I would really rate it with two stars, but the seriousness of intent on the part of the makers that is so evident throughout earns them another star - albeit somewhat grudgingly.If only they had been able to fully realize their vision..",3,Unfulfilled promise...,1100390400,"11 14, 2004",2004,1269,"['Much', 'production', 'promised', 'well', 'promise', 'unfulfilled', 'film', 'fairly', 'strong', 'sense', 'style', 'kept', 'up', 'lacking', 'substance', 'plain', 'fact', 'matter', 'was', 'rather', 'bored', 'beginning', 'end', 'Yes', 'were', 'good', 'things', 'were', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'chase', 'away', 'strong', 'sense', 'ennui', 'remarkable', 'considering', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'really', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'just', 'othe', 'reviews', 'have', 'mentioned', 'animation', 'dated', 'certainly', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'impressive', 'time', 'was', 'only', '1989', 'surprising', 'how', 'much', 'average', 'quality', 'level', 'anime', 'general', 'gone', 'up', 'following', 'decade', 'sound', 'department', 'fairly', 'nice', 'stereo', 'soundstage', 'effects', 'music', 'other', 'hand', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'including', 'unfortunate', 'testaments', 'quality', '80s', 'synthesizers', 'may', 'rest', 'pieces', '.In', 'conclusion', 'effort', 'was', 'simply', 'wanting', 'would', 'really', 'rate', 'two', 'stars', 'seriousness', 'intent', 'part', 'makers', 'so', 'evident', 'star', 'albeit', 'somewhat', 'only', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'fully', 'realize', 'vision..']",Blood Reign - Curse of the Yoma
569682,A26O0T192IBKY1,B000056MMA,J. Alford,"[0, 0]","This late-80s 2-part OVA was probably one of the first horror anime to be released in English. Originally released in subtitled VHS as Curse Of The Undead Yoma, it was later re-released on dubbed VHS and DVD as Blood Reign: Curse Of The Yoma. Adapted from the short-lived manga series Yoma by Sengoku Nights creator Kei Kusunoki, this was first billed as &#34;ninjas vs. zombies&#34; years before zombies were made popular again thanks to the Dawn Of The Dead remake.Set in feudal Japan, a young skilled ninja named Hikage is charged with tracking down his childhood friend/fellow ninja Marou who has deserted his clan and is feared to leak the death of their leader who was killed by yoma which are Japanese demons. Hikage's quest leads him to a village inhabited by stragglers and derelicts. All its inhabitants are really sacrifices for the yoma, and grizzly giant spiders harvest them for their leader, who turns out to be Marou, that is really a yoma himself apparently born from the ground itself. Marou escapes, and then the next episode takes place two years later with Hikage still on his trail. This has Hikage getting into a feudal war between the yoma clans and his ninja clan, facing all matter of beasts and monsters. Everything from flesh-eating horses, wolf-taurs, butterfly-women, giant snakes, and other video game bosses that even Ash from Evil Dead say &#34;Screw this! I'm going home!&#34;Toho handled this animation for this, and for a late-80s production it actually is pretty damn good. There is some serious full-scale gore in store for anyone who wants just a good slasher flick, and they don't skip on the details during the disemboweling. This also makes for a great ninja story too, not Ninja Scroll mind you, but a close second. The dub is pretty stale though, so you might wanna just watch it in Japanese.",3,Ninjas vs. Zombies!,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,1836,"['late-80s', '2-part', 'OVA', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'first', 'horror', 'anime', 'be', 'released', 'English', 'Originally', 'released', 'subtitled', 'VHS', 'Curse', 'Undead', 'Yoma', 'was', 'later', 're-released', 'dubbed', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'Blood', 'Reign', 'Curse', 'Yoma', 'Adapted', 'short-lived', 'manga', 'series', 'Yoma', 'Sengoku', 'Nights', 'creator', 'Kei', 'Kusunoki', 'was', 'first', 'billed', '34', 'zombies', '34', 'years', 'zombies', 'were', 'made', 'popular', 'again', 'thanks', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'remake.Set', 'feudal', 'Japan', 'young', 'skilled', 'ninja', 'named', 'Hikage', 'charged', 'tracking', 'down', 'childhood', 'friend/fellow', 'ninja', 'Marou', 'who', 'deserted', 'clan', 'feared', 'leak', 'death', 'leader', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'yoma', 'are', 'Japanese', 'demons', 'Hikage', 'quest', 'village', 'inhabited', 'stragglers', 'derelicts', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'really', 'sacrifices', 'yoma', 'grizzly', 'giant', 'spiders', 'harvest', 'leader', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Marou', 'really', 'yoma', 'apparently', 'born', 'ground', 'Marou', 'then', 'next', 'episode', 'place', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'Hikage', 'still', 'trail', 'Hikage', 'getting', 'feudal', 'war', 'yoma', 'clans', 'ninja', 'clan', 'facing', 'matter', 'beasts', 'monsters', 'Everything', 'flesh-eating', 'horses', 'wolf-taurs', 'butterfly-women', 'giant', 'snakes', 'other', 'video', 'game', 'even', 'Ash', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'say', '34', 'Screw', ""'m"", 'going', 'home', '34', 'Toho', 'handled', 'animation', 'late-80s', 'production', 'actually', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'serious', 'full-scale', 'gore', 'store', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'good', 'slasher', 'flick', 'do', ""n't"", 'skip', 'details', 'disemboweling', 'also', 'great', 'ninja', 'story', 'too', 'not', 'Ninja', 'Scroll', 'mind', 'close', 'second', 'dub', 'pretty', 'stale', 'might', 'wan', 'na', 'just', 'watch', 'Japanese']",Blood Reign - Curse of the Yoma

569687,A3SP37JLGH5KFY,B000056MMA,punkviper,"[15, 15]","This is some old anime, 1989 to be exact.  So when people bellyache about it not being up to snuff technically, then there's why.  If you judge it by other anime of that period, then it holds up just fine.The story is meant to be moody and semi-cryptic (imagine that!  cryptic anime!) and when I watched it at about 3AM it genuinely weirded me out.  There is much deceit and decadence, and the traditionally clueless main character, questing though he's not quite sure why or how.Surely this is no Ninja Scroll or Samurai X (Rurouni Kenshin), the storytelling aspect is not nearly as well done.  But on a more basic level of horror and intrigue, it succeeds well.  I think it all depends on what you're expecting when you first view the film.  Don't approach Blood Reign thinking you're in for the second coming of Akira and you will be pleased.

Lately i watched the english version and now i want to tell all of you who read this - DON'T watch the syncronized version ! Even though you might not like watching movies with subtitles but this pictures loses A LOT in it's translated state.The cute squeekish voice of Aya has turned into an average female anime girl voice, the yoma sound as if they have no lust in preying on the humans anymore - in short words - the whole vocal cast is totally messed up. Alone the way they speak out the name of the main person, Hikage (which they do a lot in the flic) is a pain to the ears.
