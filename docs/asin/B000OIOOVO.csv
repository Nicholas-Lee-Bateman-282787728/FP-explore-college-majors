While these are all valid points, nonetheless, having watched this season recently, it made me laugh as much as any other. Maybe we're in danger of focussing on the trees and missing the forest - despite all the negatives, Seinfeld remained, and still remains, absolutely hilarious. How many other shows from the 90s bear rewatching now, and manage to retain the charm and humour they had at the time? Very few, it seems to me. There is a timelessness in this show that makes it a gem.

1064358,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000OIOOVO,calvinnme,"[49, 52]","""Seinfeld"" did a pretty good job rebounding from Larry David's departure from the show. Jerry doesn't have as many segments featured around him this season, possibly because of the stepped up demands on his time behind the camera. However, the ones in which he is featured are very funny. For example, Jerry has a check bounce, and the unfriendly merchant puts the returned check on display in his store. Word gets back to Jerry's parents, and they jump to conclusions and decide that Jerry must be broke. Jerry's dad decides to return to work to help support Jerry. Unfortunately, the job his dad takes is working for Elaine, and the situation doesn't work out for anyone.George, reeling from the mixed emotions he had at losing Susan at the end of season seven, prepares to go on without her, but finds that he really can't. Instead, Susan's parents start a charitable foundation in her memory and have George installed on the board with a large framed photograph of Susan framed on the wall in the room where the foundation meetings are held. Later in the season, George does meet a woman he is interested in, and she seems to be interested in him. George, always trying to better his position through lying but usually just worsening his lot because of it, does the same thing in this instance. The woman believes George is a tourist from Arkansas, and George decides to continue the deception by faking a move to the city so he can continue the relationship. The way George sees it, if you condense everything he has accomplished in the last ten years into just a few weeks, it seems quite impressive.Elaine enters an alternate universe when she meets Kevin and his friends, who turn out to be the opposite of Jerry and his friends in every way. She likes the fact that Kevin and his friends inspire her to be a better person - they are genuinely kind and helpful and they enjoy reading. However, ultimately Elaine is just not cut out to be among them because of her own selfish personality traits. Perhaps the funniest episode featuring Elaine is ""The English Patient"", titled after the Best Picture winner of 1996. Her boss, the eccentric Peterman, loves the film and forces her to go see it with him. Elaine hates the movie, and just can't take sitting through it in its entirety without blurting out how she feels. Peterman gives her a chance to do penance for her bad attitude which involves a most hilarious assignment. In ""The Susie"", due to a series of mix-ups, Elaine winds up with an alternate identity at work - ""Susie"". Her coworkers begin discussing her as though Elaine and Susie are two different people. Her ultimate solution to the problem is to have Susie ""die"", complete with a memorial service for the fictitious woman that winds up packed with mourners.Of course, Kramer's adventures are as unbelievable as ever. This season his apartment turns into ""The Red Planet"" due to a neon sign from the Kenny Rogers Roasters restaurant shining through his window all night. At first he is doing everything he can to put the restaurant out of business, but when he and Jerry temporarily switch apartments the pressure is off, and Kramer finds himself addicted to the restaurant's food. In another episode, Elaine's boss Jay Peterman is trying to write his memoirs, but finds his own life isn't very interesting. His solution is to buy Kramer's life story and use it as his own. Kramer and Peterman eventually get into an argument over the details of the  arrangement, and Kramer answers back by starting his own ""Peterman Reality Tours"". Finally, Kramer is incensed by the fact that he can no longer find a public place in which he can light up a cigar, and opens a smoking lounge in his own apartment. As a result of all of the exposure to tobacco smoke, Kramer ages prematurely and goes to his attorney friend, the fast-talking and flamboyant Jackie Chiles, to file suit against the tobacco companies. When Kramer negotiates a deal with the tobacco companies without Jackie's approval, Jackie declares the results to be ""the most public of his many humiliations"".In summary, this season is very good with more of an emphasis on fast-paced zaniness rather than the comedy that made more of a commentary on human nature that you saw during the Larry David years.

1064371,A21M6XJHHBQSEC,B000OIOOVO,G. Kroener,"[3, 3]","Finally, we hold it in our hands, the 8th season of maybe the best sitcom ever created.In season 8, cast and crew, and especially the writers, found themselves in an awkward position. On one hand, they had just finished what some consider Seinfeld's best season (number 7), and a successful season 8 was almost guaranteed, but on the other hand, half of the series' genius spirit, Larry David, had just left the show.As it is mentioned in the fantastic featurette ""Jerry Seinfeld: Submarine Captain"", this meant a total restructuring of the writing process. Unlike in the previous seven seasons, where Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld would revise other writers' scripts and have the final saying, season 8 is much more of a team effort.That also meant much more storylines of the individual writers would get to the editing room as they were conceived by them.The result is a show that takes all the characters' qualities, and human misbehaviours that were established in earlier seasons, and turns them almost into a life action cartoon.In The Comeback for instance, when the writers take George's envy and (previously subtle) anger, and make it larger than life, so that in the end, he flies from New York to Akron, Ohio, just to come back at a guy with a witty one-liner that he didn't think of earlier.I always enjoy the audio commentaries, of which there are far more in this season than in season 7, and I like it how the writers aren't shy of criticising themselves. That's really an attitude that I don't think anyone but Seinfeld writers can have.In The Bizarro Jerry, for instance, writer David Mandel charmingly explains, without rest or full stop, why season 8 and 9 have a different feeling, and how the show commented on itself.Tom Gamill and Max Pross, whose first episode was ""The Glasses"", have their last show in this season, and quite frankly, I think that was for the better. The ""Notes About Nothing"" subtitles list all their episodes, and to my surprise I discovered that they had written all the episodes that I found least enjoyable and too far out there.Now, I find seasons 8 and 9 as hilarious and great as all seasons gone before, but for different reasons. And director Andy Ackerman describes it perfectly when he says that they felt like the teacher had gone out of the classroom, and the students could now have some fun.And by god, they did!They took all the pure comedy potential the characters always had, and milked it completely dry.I also find that the final three seasons featured the series' best permanent characters: ""Jacopo"" Peterman (""Where is my pineapple?"") and George Steinbrenner (""Big Stein can't be floppin' and twitchin'!"")A human caricature like Peterman could never work in seasons 1 through 6.That being said, I know very well that some people think the show lost its zing, and I fully understand why they think that. This Seinfeld is not a different Seinfeld, but Seinfeld brought to the brink of the absurd. The thing is, the characters and their unbreakable bond of unfounded hostility (formerly the almost inperceptible cruelty of daily life) are so strong that they can take it without collapsing. Even more, I think the separation of the storylines into four distinct ones for every character brought each actor to his or her full blossoming.But that, make no mistake, goes all to the expense of the ensemble performance.Every character has much to do in each episode, which contradicts the series' label as the ""show about nothing"". They all have their hands full, and that's a huge part of why season 8 feels different.Some people may tell you that all storylines are intertwined. That's not quite the truth. Yes, they come together in the end, but before that, each character goes his own way.In rewatching early seasons, you'll find that Seinfeld's best moments were always the ensemble moments, when two people more or less had the same or (in Kramer's case) no storyline. Remember George and Kramer visiting the busboy? Or Jerry and Elaine in The Pen? Or Jerry, George and Kramer at Ackman the healer? Or the Jerry/George scenes with the NBC executives?And lengthier face to face conversations are very rare now, too. It all more or less boils down to a daily debrief at the coffee shop. Why?

There is something you may call a Seinfeld experience, and I want to appraise the 8th installment of it.The eight season marked two departures: one of the co-creator/scriptwriter/producer Larry David, and second of the show itself into the realm of pure wackiness. The season seven much-maligned finale, 'The Invitations' (S07E22), can be properly understood only in the context of general quality of season eight, which was one of craziness let loose. Susan's death marked the exact moment in which the entire show made 'ping!', and flew way off into the space of absurd. From the word go in 8ht's season's opener, 'The Foundation (S08E01)', there is no way you can relate to the characters as real people. Right until the very last episode they will be first and foremost CHARACTERS - ones we all love and we all laugh our brains out at - but, nonetheless, CHARACTERS. In all of the previous seasons - despite the famous claim that it's all about nothing - there was a sense that IF any of those people encounter a real-life tragedy that touches them personally, they would stop cracking jokes and cry just as you or me would (remember Elaine's tears shed on behalf of the bubble boy...?). 'The Invitations' proved otherwise and the show really became one about nothing: just the four pop-culture characters thrown into wackier and wackier situations. To my mind, this time no Sein-imation is needed, since season 8 (and 9) simply is the live-action equivalent of traditional cartoon.And what a cartoon it is! One of the benefits of a then well-established mega-popularity of the show is the delight the screenwriters take in self-references. One of the most hilarious episodes of this season, 'The Bizarro Jerry' (S08E03), is the best example of what I'm talking about. It takes for granted our familiarity with all the patterns, all the characters and all the soundstages even - and twirls them around in a way that makes the entire episode a comment on the Seinfeld universe itself. By showing us the opposite (ha!) of Jerry's world within the 'Seinfeld' world, and laughing it up, the show gives a finger to all the reality that didn't absorb Seinfeld and even had the nerve to denounce it's mastery (of the domain). And no, I'm not misinterpreting the show's nose-scratching for an offensive gesture (or even for an actual pick).The key word to the last two seasons of Seinfeld is irony: the show has become so self-aware, that it could go either way: mocking itself, mythologizing itself, aping itself - and the audience would love it even more than before because it was all so wacky and so familiar at the same time. The ideas were so crazy you sometimes went ""Sweet holy Moses"" - but the little kicks never stopped. And we all loved every minute of them.The 8 & 9 season are my favourites. To my mind they simply are the muffin tops: with all the stems of society, emotion and common sense neatly sliced off.
