Come on, you see a poster of DVD sleeve displaying Liv Tyler washing a car in a tight-fitting dress, foam and all that - what do you think you are going to see? It is a comedy, for goodness sake! Cut them some slack, be a bit more realistic in what you hope to be watching and I promise you'll have a good time.NOTE: If drooling at unspeakable beauty of Liv Tyler is your thing, then you will have an absolutely turbo-charged fantastic time and don't bother renting because you're going to buy this anyway.The makers of this film could have done much, much worse. When you have Liv Tyler, you could just show her for 90 minutes reading newspaper, ironing clothes or walking around and hundreds of thousands of males would watch this happily time after time. Well, they have done much more than that. The plot is good, dialogue is strong (although comedy charge is at times flagging), and actors are really pulling their weight.Michael Douglas, who has a tiny role in this film, is exceptionally good and frankly this is his best appearance since Wall Street.I liked this movie.

Jewel's second favourite thing in the world is water. Numero Uno is, not surprisingly; doing the WILD THANG!! The motives of the men (played by John Goodman, Matt Dillon and Paul Reiser) for pursuing Jewel are varied. See if you can match up the reason with the actor. 1 guy is a cop and knows she's a thief, another is in it for the nookie and the last guy worships the ground Jewel walks on, sad fool that he is. You don't have to be a brain surgeon to figure it out. Despite a good cast ONE NIGHT AT McCOOLS is very repetitive and tiresome, which is sad, because Michael Douglas is excellent as usual and also co-produced the movie. As for Liv Tyler, she has never been hotter, but she keeps her bra on during the sex scenes. I hate that. It's totally unrealistic. Her dress is so tight it's amazing that her boobs don't pop out. And this movie is so predictable and obvious that it's unbelievable that the viewer's brain doesn't start leaking out of his/her ears.

Liv Tyler gives a very sexy performance in the best tradition of film noir goddesses as a double-crossing vixen who always gets her way.

The plot weaves and weaves like a spider spinning a very complicated web, convincing you that it will end up in a very clever and surprising way. However, a very violent and simplistic ending that seems to have been written by a grade-schooler is the outcome, leaving the audience angry for having been cheated into such an empty experience.

It was a welcome diversion after a hard day's work. Hands down, Michael Douglas is the funniest person in the film. I have to give him enormous credit for letting himself be made over cosmetically into the most ridiculous looking guy you've ever met with full pompadour hairdo. But there are many other solid performances too. Liv Tyler does a really good job as the beautiful bombshell who comes into men's lives as their dream pick-up only to turn their lives upside down. In fact, contact with her may make you end up dead as she has a way of waltzing into troublesome, dangerous situations. It was great seeing Matt Dillon for a change playing a role where he is the one totally out of control in the hands of the wrong woman. Paul Reiser as Dillon's lawyer cousin who wants Tyler as his dominatrix is very funny too and his solo scene at the end of the movie had me doubled over with laughter. John Goodman, however, is too much over the top as is Andrew Dice Clay. Their roles are almost cartoon-like they are so broad. Tyler is proving herself very well as an actress.

Maybe it is just one long set up for a Village People gag, but it's fun to stay at the YMCA. They have assembled a very interesting cast, and everyone contributes, making the whole equal to more than the sum of its parts. The story is told like a Faulkner novel, from multiple viewpoints. It's Rashamon Time, as Randy the bartender (Matt Dillon); his cousin, the lawyer Carl Harding (Paul Reiser); and grieving widower Detective Dehling (John Goodman), all tell different versions of the events that happened One Night at McCool's. Each of the men have someone to tell their story to: Carl tells Dr. Green (Reba McEntire), Dehling tells Father Jimmy (Richard Jenkins), and Randy tells Mr. Burmeister (Michael Douglas), the hitman he has hired to take care of his ""problem.""Randy's problem is Jewel Valentine (Liv Tyler), the woman he encountered One Night at McCool's. She has driven him, along with Carl and Detective Dehling, stark raving crazy. All she really wants is to have a nice house full of nice furniture and things, but what won't she do to get them? Or, what won't she make the men do?Liv Tyler is well cast as a woman with the the power to drive men wild. She has a certain charisma, but at the same time she's kind of a dork. See Stealing Beauty for further evidence of her beautiful brand of dorkiness. Paul Reiser was best known for the sit com, ""Mad About You,"" but One Night at McCool's gives him the opportunity to stretch his comedic envelope. Richard Jenkins, as Father Jimmy, turns in yet another brilliant character actor turn. He has finally gotten some recognition with an Oscar nomination for ""The Visitor."" As the lead, not supporting, Jack. John Goodman is a good man, Matt Dillon is always willin' to go that extra mile, and Michael Douglas is a hit as the hitman.

668519,A2F3U8FECR2C3R,B00005NGAU,Dr Jack L Edwards,"[2, 2]","I just watched this movie for the first time and had been engaged in a low-level struggle to finish it.  I like Goodman and Douglas and they, more than the others, OK ""Jewel"" (Tyler) provided numerous watchable moments, kept me committed to the end.  Then, in about the last 10 minutes, unlike the editorial review, the movie ""hits full speed"" and I'm right there with the characters.  The ending was a wonderful and a shockingly funny surprise that linked up with an earlier comment in the movie by Reiser, but off just enough to avoid clich&eacute;d predictability and that ending started me laughing for about 20 minutes.  I liked Tyler's sensitive choice at the end regarding Dillon's character.What a delight!  Why the hell isn't it out on DVD, or is it?  Tyler played her role well and after I stopped laughing, I wanted to believe the McCool's had followed the movie, Falling Down and Douglas' character in that movie.  I so wanted to imagine that his character, Mr. Burmeister in McCool's was a reprise, with a vengeance, of William 'D-Fens' Foster in Falling Down.  The makeup of the two characters seemed similar to me, but the ""character"" of Burmeister was a great counterpoint to that of Foster.  The ending of this film definitely justifies the time spent.I must disagree with Roger Ebert's comment at the time that the film ""is so busy with its crosscut structure and its interlocking stories that it never really gives us anyone to identify with.""  By the end of the movie, there is plenty of character with which to identify and the ""crosscut structure and interlocking stories"" are a easy gig for today's multi-taskers.A minor annoyance in the film was that they could have let the song at the end of the movie play out a bit longer to help retain the feeling.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[20, 22]","What happens when you mix together a con man, a con man's twin brother, a bartender,a shrink, a hit-man, a priest, a cop, 2 lawyers and a sultry siren?  Well, the result will be something like ONE NIGHT AT McCOOL's.  As with any mixed drink of this sort, you may not get what you expect, but you'll leave the bar happy.If ever there were such a thing as a dark romantic comedy, this would be it.  If you think you're getting another couples-friendly run-of-the-mill romantic comedy, you're wrong.  Whether that is good or bad depends on the viewer.The movie features an all-star cast that includes Matt Dillon, Michael Douglas, Paul Reiser and John Goodman.  However, the performance that carries the film is that of Liv Tyler as the gorgeous femme fatal who is bad news for everyone.  Not only does she possess the physical assets to pull off the part, but she is a bona-fide good actress on top of that.  The car wash scene by itself is worth the modest price of the DVD.The best reason to buy this flick is that it is utterly hilarious.  The way it hits on every man's fantasy will be appealing to male viewers, while the fact that it at the same time mocks these fantasies will be something women will find amusing.  The film finds humor in rather bizarre situations, but it will nonetheless leave you in stitches.So, with this in mind, go out and spend a night at McCool's.  Stick around awhile and enjoy your drink - it all goes down smooth.  Then at the end of the night, click your feet three times and say &quot;There's no place like home, there's no place like home, there's no place like home.&quot;  And, by the way, home is where the DVD is...",5,A night to remember,1045440000,"02 17, 2003",2003,1656,"['What', 'when', 'mix', 'together', 'con', 'man', 'con', 'man', 'twin', 'brother', 'bartender', 'shrink', 'hit-man', 'priest', 'cop', '2', 'lawyers', 'sultry', 'siren', 'Well', 'result', 'will', 'be', 'something', 'ONE', 'NIGHT', 'AT', 'McCOOL', 'mixed', 'drink', 'sort', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'what', 'expect', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'bar', 'happy.If', 'ever', 'were', 'thing', 'dark', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'would', 'be', 'think', ""'re"", 'getting', 'couples-friendly', 'run-of-the-mill', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'good', 'bad', 'depends', 'viewer.The', 'movie', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'John', 'Goodman', 'However', 'performance', 'film', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'gorgeous', 'femme', 'fatal', 'who', 'bad', 'news', 'everyone', 'Not', 'only', 'possess', 'physical', 'assets', 'pull', 'off', 'part', 'bona-fide', 'good', 'actress', 'top', 'car', 'wash', 'scene', 'modest', 'price', 'DVD.The', 'best', 'reason', 'buy', 'flick', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'way', 'man', 'fantasy', 'will', 'be', 'appealing', 'male', 'viewers', 'fact', 'same', 'time', 'mocks', 'fantasies', 'will', 'be', 'something', 'women', 'will', 'find', 'amusing', 'film', 'humor', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'situations', 'will', 'nonetheless', 'leave', 'stitches.So', 'mind', 'go', 'out', 'spend', 'night', 'McCool', 'Stick', 'awhile', 'enjoy', 'drink', 'down', 'smooth', 'Then', 'end', 'night', 'click', 'feet', 'three', 'times', 'say', 'quot', 'place', 'home', 'place', 'home', 'place', 'home.', 'quot', 'way', 'home', 'where', 'DVD']",One Night at McCool's

Three men are all in love with Jewel, and they all have their own story to tell.  This is where the Pulp Fiction reminder comes in as there are three different subplots that all eventually lead up to something similar.The movie starts with Randy, played by Matt Dillon, going to see Michael Douglas's character, play Bingo, and he tells Douglas his story. Douglas is a contract killer.Paul Reiser goes to see a psychiatrist, played by country western singer, Reba Macintyre.  She is sporting an awful haircut, and in my opinion, should stick to her country western schtick.John Goodman goes to see a priest/friend because he has something very important to tell him.One night (all in the same night) at McCool's bar they all meet Jewel, and they all fall captive to her.Jewel and her so-called ""boyfriend"" Utah, played by a somewhat unrecgonizible Andrew Dice Clay, are trying pull off robberies by getting a sympathetic character like Matt Dillon's Randy to allow Jewel into their homes so they can rob him.  Jewel falls for Randy, and suddenly wants out of the robbery  way of life, and gets it by shooting Utah right as he is about to rob McCool's bar, where Randy is the bartender.She takes up with Randy and then takes over his house.  Paul Reiser is Randy's Lawyer cousin who develops a Walter Mitty like fantasy over Jewel, and eventually has an affair with her.  John Goodman is the suspicious police detective that gets involved with the murder cases. Yes, there is more than one.It took a little while for this movie to get going. It was a little boring in the beginning, and then as more characters were introduced, I became more interested.  It's very funny and the ending totally took me by surprise.

Hottie Tyler comes to jerkwater town running a con and ruins the lives of five men, four who end up dead.  This is all in the name of attaining a house that in her words could be featured in a magazine, but this dream is in reality just [an] enclave of bad taste, like when hillbillies rob an armored car.  In the end, she prances off unscathed and oblivious to the lives she's ruined. Paul Riser is contemptable as usual, John Goodman is just going though the motions, Michael Douglas is pratically cadaverous looking as a hitman with a high rise wig.  I think the main reason he is in this movie is because it is his production company or something like that.  Matt Dillon's performance is harmless enough, but the true surprises are Reba McEntire as a shrink and Andrew Clay as the vengeful brother at the film's climax, a shootout which borrows from True Romance (they may have borrowed it, too). Liv Tyler is barely on screen and when she is they don't give her too many lines; it's mainly a sausage parade.

I definately expect to see more from Harald Zwart in the future, but on to the movie.Everyone wants to be with Liv Tyler's character, Jewel (subtle, I know).  In the beginning of the film three characters, Randy (Matt Dillon), Carl (Paul Reiser), and Detective Dehling (John Goodman), describe basically the same events surrounding how they met Jewel and how it has changed their lives.  &quot;It all started one night at McCool's,&quot; they all begin, Randy to a hitman (Michael Douglas), Paul to a shrink (Reba McEntire), and Detective Dehling to a priest (Richard Jenkins).  These stories will all lead (with some bizarre subplots along the way) to the present where the wacky film concludes.This movie is a little different because it tells the same story from three different perspectives.  And they really are different.  Each character sees Jewel in a different way.  Randy likes her because she sort of reminds him of his mother, Carl likes her because he sees her as this sex kitten, a contrast to his rather dull suberban life, and Detective Dehling sees her as a reincarnation of his deceased wife. Equally funny is each man's perspective on each other.I think this film works.  Especially if it is taken for what it is.  A light, quirky comedy.  The audience is never given the true motivation of the film's catalyst, Jewel.  Her character is only presented through the eyes of the other characters until the very end, so it is hard to gain a true sense of her being.  This sort of ambiguity was well played by Tyler.  The other performances were also fun.  Michael Douglas really tripped me out, he does not normally play characters like this.One Night at McCool's, not bad.

Occasionally, as in the case of One Night at McCool's, one has managed to put me out...The movie is about a woman named Jewel [Liv Tyler] and the impact she has on three men who meet her one fateful evening at a neighborhood bar. Each man perceives her differently, both from the other two and from what she really is. Randy [Matt Dillon], the bartender, thinks she is the sweet young thing he has been dreaming about. His cousin, Carl [Paul Reiser], is a lawyer who believes her to be the hot woman he has always wanted. Detective Dehling [John Goodman] sees her as a damsel in distress that only he can save. What she really is is a conniving, self-centered material a girl. There have been a lot of good movies dealing with the idea of a person's appearing different to various people, but One Night at McCool's is not one of them. It's more about how some men's brains turn to mush around a sexy female. As a character Jewel isn't that interesting, so we don't ultimately care how these guys react to her.Tyler has been good on other movies, but this one's attempts to turn her into a sex symbol doesn't do her any favors. In one scene she hoses herself down while washing a car...  Goodman and Reiser are adequate in their thankless roles, as is Michael Douglas, who plays a hit man. Douglas also had the misfortune to be one of the movie's producers. Dillion is believable as the bartender, but only because he'd probably make a better bartender than he does an actor.Most movies usually work on some level.

I'd seen some of Zwart's earlier works, like HAMILTON and the controversial music video for A-HA, and the fella did seem to be talented (albeit somewhat commercial). In addition to this, ONE NIGHT AT MCCOOL's fronted a strong cast (although I'm not Mat Dillon's number one fan) and a storyline that claimed to lend influence from Coen films (and you gotta love them Coen brothers). So my question is; Where did it all go wrong? Well, the film is just too unoriginal. The jokes are old. It's no longer funny seeing a fat police officer stand behind a cuffed man so that it would appear they're doing ""you know what"". It's been done to death. This is certainly the film's main problem. Another thing that didn't quite ""click"" for me was the performance of Liv Tyler. I find the notion of a film where the main character is not the center of narration, as quite intruiging, but Liv Tyler's character remains pretty much the same even though we view her from the perspectives of three different men. It would have been nice to see some traces of changes in her character. The ending is also not a lot to scream about ... So with all these things hampering the film, it doesn't really matter that the film fronts strong visuals (which is often the case when the director has a background doing music videos) and a gallery of what could have been interesting characters.

I thought the movie would be based around Liv being an evil temptress who uses her good looks and sexuality to manipulate men into committing murders and other crimes.  I was wrong though, the previews tell you nothing about the movie at all.  So, in the end, I was pleasantly surprised and I gained some respect for Liv's acting ability.The story revolves around Liv's character, Jewel Valentine, and is told from three different points of view: Randy the bartender (Matt Dillon), Carl the lawyer (Paul Reiser), and detective Dehling (John Goodman).  All three men get mixed up with Jewel after a robbery goes wrong at Randy's bar (McCool's) and the movie is comprised of the 3 men telling about their involvement with her to a hit man, a shrink, and a priest (respectively).  It all started....one night at McCool's.I can't say too much about the plot because it is too complicated for a non-spoiler summary...you'll just have to see it.  The film was fun to watch because of the whole story telling thing going on between the 3 men and the listeners (the hit man, the psychologist, and the priest)...each guy has a skewed memory and it's interesting to see how they all recall events a little differently.  There are lots of flashbacks in the film, when the men are remembering things about Jewel, and each guy makes her out to be way sexier than she really was...she was sexy, but the guys remember her as being this oozing sex bucket (which is kinda funny).Recommendation:  This movie was entertaining, it had a lot of big laughs, and it was interesting because the story was told from three different points of view.  Girls will like it because it makes fun of the way men think (it's funny to see the way the men confused their fantasy with reality and made Liv extra sexy in their heads) and guys will like it because Liv Tyler is gorgeous and she has some really sexy scenes (which, again, were actually the fantasies of the men involved in the story).",3,One Night At McCool's -- Popkorn Junkie's (and my) review,1020124800,"04 30, 2002",2002,2125,"['really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'like', 'movie', 'previews', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'spraying', 'water', 'ala', 'soft', 'core', 'porn', 'flick', 'Aerosmith', 'video', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'based', 'Liv', 'being', 'evil', 'temptress', 'who', 'good', 'looks', 'sexuality', 'manipulate', 'men', 'committing', 'murders', 'other', 'crimes', 'was', 'wrong', 'previews', 'tell', 'nothing', 'movie', 'So', 'end', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'gained', 'respect', 'Liv', 'acting', 'ability.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Liv', 'character', 'Jewel', 'Valentine', 'told', 'three', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'Randy', 'bartender', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Carl', 'lawyer', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'detective', 'Dehling', 'John', 'Goodman', 'three', 'men', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'Jewel', 'robbery', 'wrong', 'Randy', 'bar', 'McCool', 'movie', 'comprised', '3', 'men', 'telling', 'involvement', 'hit', 'man', 'shrink', 'priest', 'respectively', 'started', '.one', 'night', ""McCool's.I"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'too', 'complicated', 'non-spoiler', 'summary', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'whole', 'story', 'telling', 'thing', 'going', '3', 'men', 'listeners', 'hit', 'man', 'psychologist', 'priest', 'guy', 'skewed', 'memory', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'recall', 'events', 'little', 'differently', 'are', 'lots', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'when', 'men', 'are', 'remembering', 'things', 'Jewel', 'guy', 'out', 'be', 'way', 'sexier', 'really', 'was', 'was', 'sexy', 'guys', 'remember', 'being', 'oozing', 'sex', 'bucket', 'kinda', 'funny', '.Recommendation', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'had', 'lot', 'big', 'laughs', 'was', 'interesting', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'three', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'Girls', 'will', 'like', 'fun', 'way', 'men', 'think', 'funny', 'see', 'way', 'men', 'confused', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'made', 'Liv', 'extra', 'sexy', 'heads', 'will', 'like', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'gorgeous', 'really', 'sexy', 'scenes', 'again', 'were', 'actually', 'fantasies', 'men', 'involved', 'story']",One Night at McCool's

668543,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B00005NGAU,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[2, 3]","This film ended up being much more entertaining than I thought.  The cast is great.  Paul Reiser, John Goodman, Michael Douglas, Reba McEntire, and others. I've never cared much for Matt Dillon but this role for him worked pretty good here.But, who really makes the film great was the gorgeous femme fatale, Liv Tyler.  I've loved her in many films.  She's got this natural trashy demeanor that is just so sexy.  The kind of girl you'd hope to meet if you had to walk through some delapitated trailer park, and she happens to be sitting on her porch looking for any guy who just happens to walk by.She's got such a convincing innocent look on her face while her intentions are devious as ever.  That's the magic of this film's appeal.  No one else could have played this part better than her.  Well, maybe Marisa Tomei.She ended up entering into the lives of three unsuspecting guys, and tears their heart's apart.  Well, actually about six guys, but the main focus is on just the three.  And all she wanted in the end was just a roof over her head, and a DVD player.My new sharper imaging 32"" LCD HDTV really helps add to the detailed appearance of how ugly and run-down Matt Dillon's old house looks on the outside.  This contributes to putting some art into this film.  Plus, Liv Tyler's trashy dresses throughout the film.God, I wonder want she would do for a guy who would give her two DVD players.",4,It's seems like all she wanted was just a silly DVD player.,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,1403,"['film', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'cast', 'great', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Reba', 'McEntire', 'others', ""'ve"", 'never', 'cared', 'much', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'role', 'worked', 'pretty', 'good', 'here.But', 'who', 'really', 'film', 'great', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Liv', 'Tyler', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'many', 'films', 'got', 'natural', 'trashy', 'demeanor', 'just', 'so', 'sexy', 'kind', 'girl', ""'d"", 'hope', 'meet', 'had', 'walk', 'delapitated', 'trailer', 'park', 'be', 'sitting', 'porch', 'looking', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'walk', 'by.She', 'got', 'such', 'convincing', 'innocent', 'look', 'face', 'intentions', 'are', 'devious', 'ever', 'magic', 'film', 'appeal', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'part', 'better', 'Well', 'maybe', 'Marisa', 'Tomei.She', 'ended', 'up', 'entering', 'lives', 'three', 'unsuspecting', 'guys', 'tears', 'heart', 'apart', 'Well', 'actually', 'six', 'guys', 'main', 'focus', 'just', 'three', 'wanted', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'roof', 'head', 'DVD', 'player.My', 'new', 'sharper', 'imaging', '32', 'LCD', 'HDTV', 'really', 'add', 'detailed', 'appearance', 'how', 'ugly', 'run-down', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'old', 'house', 'outside', 'putting', 'art', 'film', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'trashy', 'film.God', 'wonder', 'want', 'would', 'do', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'two', 'DVD', 'players']",One Night at McCool's
668544,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,B00005NGAU,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[2, 2]","Movie Summary: Randy is a bartender at McCool's. His life isn't anything special, but he gets by. Until one night at McCool's when he meets up with Jewel and everything changes. Jewel quickly moves into Randy's life and tears it apart. She also wreaks havoc in the lives of Randy's cousin Carl, and Police detective Dehling both of whom she met that same night at McCools. As Randy desperately tries to get rid of her, both Carl and Dehling try to win her. But in the end only Jewel gets what she wants.My Opinion: I heard negative reviews of ONAM before seeing it and this lowered my expectations. I have found that my expectations have a lot to do with how much I like or dislike a movie. Some of the biggest and best surprises have come from movies that I heard were &quot;no good&quot; and some of the worst movie experiences have come from movies that had gotten built up in my mind. In the case of ONAM my expectations were rightfully dropped. The movie seems to have many of the pieces that make a great picture, but the ones it has just don't gel. There are some good performances by Matt Dillion, Paul Reiser, and Andrew Dice Clay and there are some funny situations, but they just seem to go flat. I found the plot a little hard to swallow. Although I like Liv Tyler, I couldn't buy Jewel as being that magnetic and magical as to lure these men into destruction. In the end I think the alternate ending on the DVD shows that even the director didn't know where the movie was going. In one ending Jewel smashes the snow globe, and in the other she does not.  If the director can't decide where the movie is going, how can the viewer?DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1. Good picture quality. Sound: DD 5.1 My Love Is Alive sounded pretty good. I wondered what happened to Joan Osborne. Extras: Deleted scenes including an alternate ending, Making Of, Comentary. Menus: Snow Globe Menu is interesting. This is a fairly decent DVD release.What You Should Do: Rent it if you are going to check it out. If you can lower your expectations enough, then it is worth seeing.Related Movies To Check Out: Something About Mary, Snatch, Meet The Parents",3,I'm over here now!,1005868800,"11 16, 2001",2001,2163,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'Randy', 'bartender', 'McCool', 'life', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'one', 'night', 'McCool', 'when', 'up', 'Jewel', 'everything', 'changes', 'Jewel', 'quickly', 'Randy', 'life', 'tears', 'apart', 'also', 'wreaks', 'havoc', 'lives', 'Randy', 'cousin', 'Carl', 'Police', 'detective', 'Dehling', 'whom', 'met', 'same', 'night', 'McCools', 'Randy', 'desperately', 'get', 'rid', 'Carl', 'Dehling', 'try', 'win', 'end', 'only', 'Jewel', 'what', 'wants.My', 'Opinion', 'heard', 'negative', 'reviews', 'ONAM', 'seeing', 'lowered', 'expectations', 'have', 'found', 'expectations', 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'how', 'much', 'like', 'dislike', 'movie', 'biggest', 'best', 'surprises', 'have', 'come', 'movies', 'heard', 'were', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'worst', 'movie', 'experiences', 'have', 'come', 'movies', 'had', 'gotten', 'built', 'up', 'mind', 'case', 'ONAM', 'expectations', 'were', 'rightfully', 'dropped', 'movie', 'have', 'many', 'pieces', 'make', 'great', 'picture', 'ones', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'gel', 'are', 'good', 'performances', 'Matt', 'Dillion', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'are', 'funny', 'situations', 'just', 'seem', 'go', 'flat', 'found', 'plot', 'little', 'hard', 'swallow', 'like', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Jewel', 'being', 'magnetic', 'magical', 'lure', 'men', 'destruction', 'end', 'think', 'alternate', 'ending', 'DVD', 'even', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'one', 'ending', 'Jewel', 'snow', 'globe', 'other', 'not', 'director', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'where', 'movie', 'going', 'how', 'can', 'viewer', 'DVD', 'Quality', 'Video', 'Widescreen', 'Anamorphic', '1.85:1', 'Good', 'picture', 'quality', 'Sound', 'DD', '5.1', 'My', 'Love', 'Is', 'Alive', 'sounded', 'pretty', 'good', 'wondered', 'what', 'happened', 'Joan', 'Osborne', 'Extras', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'alternate', 'ending', 'Making', 'Comentary', 'Menus', 'Snow', 'Globe', 'Menu', 'interesting', 'fairly', 'decent', 'DVD', 'release.What', 'Should', 'Do', 'Rent', 'are', 'going', 'check', 'out', 'can', 'lower', 'expectations', 'enough', 'then', 'worth', 'seeing.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Out', 'Something', 'Mary', 'Snatch', 'Meet', 'Parents']",One Night at McCool's

Even more surprisingly, I found this fabulous film in my local Wal-Mart's $5.50 bin. Their low, low prices were my big, big DVD collection gain, as this is one movie I will never part with. The story revolves around 3 men's recounting of one night at McCool's, the local bar, where they each become smitten with a beautiful young woman named Jewel (Liv Tyler). But she's not as sweet and innocent as she looks. She knows how to play each of them to get exactly what she wants. Matt Dillon as the bartender, Paul Reiser as the lawyer and John Goodman as the cop all get in over their heads with Jewel. It's fun to watch this whole thing unfold before your eyes and the end includes a very interesting scene you definitely don't expect which makes this movie all the more fun.
