This movie has comedy,intrigue, unique plot twists, and interesting magic tricks.  I don't want to say too much without being fearful of giving plot twists away, but I will say if you are a fan of the genre, I would recommend this movie as it is unlike anything I have seen before in the genre and I feel it is unique.

Derek Yee, ""Shinjuku Incident"", ""Protege"", ""One Nite in Mongkok"") comes a Hong Kong action fantasy film starring Tony Leung Chiu Wai (""Hero"", ""2046&#8243;, ""Infernal Affairs"", ""In the Mood for Love""), Lau Ching-wa (""Mad Detective"", ""Black Mask"", ""Running Out of Time"") and Zhou Xun  (""Painted Skin: The Resurrection"", ""Flying Swords of Dragon Gate"", ""Cloud Atlas"", ""Suzhou River"").The film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Well Go USA Entertainment in March 2013.VIDEO:""The Great Magician"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  The film is presented in 16:9 widescreen and picture quality is very good.  From close-up details and seeing the textures on the clothing, visual effects such as flames/fires and computer generated smoke look good especially outdoor scenes in which colors are vibrant.  Skin tones look natural and black levels are nice and deep. Overall, picture quality is very good!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Great Magician"" is presented in Mandarin (Original) and English DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio and Mandarin and English 2.0.  Both Mandarin and English lossless tracks feature good surround sound activity.  Live shows inside the theater during a magic performance utilizes audience clapping through the surround channels, fireworks come alive through the surround channels as well as ambiance.  Also, music is utilized through the surround channels.  Dialogue is crystal clear as with the musical score by Leon Ko.But a action fantasy film that with plenty of surround activity, especially during the action scenes towards the end of the film.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Great Magician"" come with the following special features:Making the Magic - (37:55) The making of ""The Great Magician"" featuring interviews with Tung-Shing Yee and the cast.  Behind-the-scenes on the making of various scenes.Trailer - (:59) Theatrical trailer for ""The Great Magician"".JUDGMENT CALL:Featuring a wonderful pairing of two great HK actors Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Lau Ching-wa with elegant actress Zhou Xun , ""The Great Magician"" is a film that is well-acted, features plenty of humor, action and fantasy elements.For the most part, the film is a comedy.  Lau Ching-wa plays the warlord Bully who is rumored to be a tyrant, but in truth, he is kindhearted and  doesn't like to see people getting hurt.  But he knows the importance of his power as a warlord and despite his lieutenant Liu wanting to exert power on the people, Bully resists.  Part of the charm of Bully Lei is that he is so unlike the warlord that people think of him as.Clumsy and naive, Lau Ching-wa is a versatile actor who knows how to get people to laugh through facial movements and his action and he achieves it in ""The Great Magician"".For Bully is mostly a man that is dedicated in growing his empire but finding a way to have his seventh wife, Liu Yin love him.Liu Yin is an independent woman who has been kept confined by Liu Yin.  A woman who just wants her father to be freed and will never submit to him or any man.  Actress Zhou Xun has done a fantastic job in many films, playing the cold or somewhat emotionless characters.  In ""The Great Magician"", she is a woman who was left behind by her fiance Chang and now that he has returned, she is not sure if she has any love for him any more.Typically, you don't see to many Hong Kong films, especially one set in the 1920&#8242;s where a woman is portrayed as strong and not the typical damsel in distress role.  The character is portrayed as independent and strong.Meanwhile, the role of Chang is wonderfully performed by veteran Tony Leung Chiu-wai.  A suave and confident magician, he wants to save his former fiance and her father, but realizes how much she has changed in years because it took so long for him to come back for her.A film showcasing a love triangle, it becomes more interesting when Bully comes to the magician Chang in hopes to learn magic to woo his seventh wife Liu Yin. But since Yin's father is a master magician and her former boyfriend is also a magician, she has seen it all.The film does feature a storyline about corrupt Chinese working with the evil Japanese who seek to cause disruption in Bully's land.  While the Lt. Liu Kun Shan (portrayed by Wu Gang) is seen as the primary antagonist, part of the problem of the film is that it tries to be a film about a love triangle, yet tries to incorporate this behind-the-scenes planning of a coup between Liu and the Japanese.  Because the film is a comedy, the antagonists action can't be taken as anything too deep.  And as a viewer, it's not easy to care for this other side story as you are more invested on Chang and whether or not he can free his former love and her father.For the most part, at 129 minutes, you feel that the pacing is off as too much of the plot involving the coup attempt is going too fast and feels rushed.But as a fan of Derek Yee's films, it's good to see him doing something outside of crime thrillers.  Not emotional, dark or deep, this is a film that is bound with humor, visual effects and is quite enjoyable as a comedy.The film does look wonderful on Blu-ray and the visual effects on the magic used throughout the film is nicely done.  Costume design is also well done and cinematography is very good.  Especially the wire-work for stunts throughout the film.  The lossless soundtrack is well-done and is quite immersive.  I wish there were more special features but I am glad that a  38-minute featurette was included as most Asian cinema tend to only have short featurettes and a trailer.Overall, ""The Great Magician"" is a fun, witty action fantasy film featuring wonderful performances by Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Lau Ching-wa and Zhou Xun.  But with a lengthy film with frenetic pacing of its intricate plot full of twists and turns, while entertaining, some portions of the film does lose its luster due to frenetic pacing.  Still enjoyable and a Hong Kong film worth watching!",4,"""The Great Magician"" is a fun, witty action fantasy film featuring wonderful performances by Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Zhou Xun",1364601600,"03

1616812,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00ATXIL54,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[5, 7]","I've always liked magic.  As a kid, I even gave it a go, but I was never the showman I hoped I'd be.  Magicians have to be consummate entertainers willing to put themselves out there knowing all the while that the sleight of hand relies entirely on them - no amount of fancy glitter or smoke can salvage a trick gone bad.  In their own humble way, films are perhaps the most complete magic act out there - they require an audience to suspend their disbelief long enough to be swept up by the play of light cleverly situated between all of the pieces of the magical puzzle.  When it's done right, it quickly becomes the kind of thing you want to share with friends and family.  When it's done wrong, it's something you moan and groan at until the credits roll.THE GREAT MAGICIAN is far from `great,' but it's good enough entertainment for a lazy afternoon or, better, a quiet evening in with the kids.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and character.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Zhang Xian (played by the likeable Tony Leung) is more than just a magician hoping to throw a few abracadabras into a crowd.  Walking out of a crowd on a busy street, he bests the local magic act, all with the secret purpose of securing a local venue.  What is his true secret?  He's back to get the girl he left behind - loved, even - in the worst vanishing act of his career; and it'll take surviving not only a confrontation with the local warlord but also outsmarting elements trying to put China under Japanese control in order for this take to reach its happy ending!Adapted from the novel by Zhang Haifan, THE GREAT MAGICIAN tries too hard to win over its audience with some shticky comedy the likes of which North America hasn't seen since the days of the Three Stooges or (perhaps more aptly) Abbott & Costello or the Marx Brothers.  It's a grand comedy of errors - flirting desperately with elements of farce - but, in doing so, it's far too heavily weighted down with a cast of characters that feels much larger than it need be.  Award-winning director Derek Yee populates the motion picture with tones of wonderful smaller moments that end up being too far apart because of far too many unimportant bigger moments that don't deliver as well as they should.Still, all of the players - Leung and his co-horts including Lau Ching-wan as the appropriately-named warlord Bully Lei and the lovely Zhou Xun as Lin (a love interest who spends most of the film sparring with both romantic leads) - embrace their right parts and give it enough honest respect that it's hard not to like MAGICIAN.  What starts out seemingly as another heavy period piece quickly becomes something that the audience possibly never expected, and that's some of the beauty of the flick: it's all one big magic act where you're waiting for the big reveal.  Watching these three work together is a wonderful experience, indeed; and when they're away for too long you probably (like I did) find yourself wishing they were back.Some of the politics of the picture might not make perfect sense to American audiences.  Suffice it to say, it took me a few moments to let it all sink in.  Once it did, I rolled with it, and I think most folks will do likewise.  If you like magic, you could do far worse than spend a single evening with THE GREAT MAGICIAN.THE GREAT MAGICIAN is produced by Bona International Film Group, Emperor Motion Pictures, and Film Unlimited.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled through Well Go USA.  For those needing to know, this is a Mandarin-spoken language picture, but there is either an English-dubbed or English-subtitled version available.  As for the technical specifications, the picture looks and sounds excellent, and clearly no expense was shared in capturing this silly-little-adventure on film.  As is often the case with these foreign imports, there are no substantive extras available - there's a brief `making of' featurette along with the theatrical trailers, but the magic ends right there, folks.RECOMMENDED.  No, it may not all be perfect magic, but there's so much in THE GREAT MAGICIAN that it's a benign charm.  Sure, it's much too long to be a fully effective period-piece caper; and, yes, it's way too bloated to be the harmless farce all involved intended for it to be; but it's still effective in its own right.  Tony Leung does what he can to steal the show, but it's a winning ensemble that makes the trick work just the way a good magician would've intended.  I would've named it ""The Good Magician"" to soften up the expectations.  I also would've cut out at least thirty minutes of some of the lesser bumbling.  And maybe - just maybe - it would've worked better.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA provided me with an advance DVD copy of THE GREAT MAGICIAN by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,Nothing Is Quite What It Seems With THE GREAT MAGICIAN,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,5185,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'magic',

1616818,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00ATXIL54,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","Set in the early 20th century of China, years after the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the Revolution in 1911, ""The Great Magician"" revolves around Tony Leung Chiu Wai's renowned illusionist Chang Hsien arriving in a town where a powerful warlord Lei Bully (Lau Ching-wan) rules. While Lei Bully tries to win the heart of his ""seventh wife"" Liu Yin (Zhou Xun), the magician seems interested in the same girl imprisoned by the warlord.This is an entertainment-oriented movie from Tung-Shing Yee (Derek Yee), director of such intense crime dramas as ""One Nite in Mongkok"" and ""Shinjuku Incident."" ""The Great Magician"" is a light-hearted fantasy action movie - at least that is what it strives to be - but the overlong film (the running time exceeding two hours) simply needs a better story.]The best part of the film is the stars Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Lau Ching-wan and Zhou Xun. The characters they play are not exactly convincing, but their superb performances almost succeed in making them look credible, together with the great production values.However, there are so many characters that pop up and disappear unceremoniously, as well as so many intrigues going on involving the Qing Dynasty supporters, Japanese military officers and Chinese revolutionaries. There are also subplots about the secret of magic spell.So what the film is all about? It is a love story, I think, but the love story is suddenly replaced by something else in the final chapter. Perhaps the idea of a great magician as a hero of a special effects-ridden action is to be blamed. So where is the magic?
