1594740,AGEIT17HENDIS,B009C30ROU,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 2]","Live fast, die young, and make a good corpse is a mantra that Hank Williams' who last ride before his premature death is the subject of the film under review, ah, called The Last Ride,  lived by. Every generation, every niche cultural enclave has its iconic wild boys (thus far mainly wild boys, although if things even out the wild women, wild women in my sense, should not be far behind) who stirred the imagination, who made their devotees believe, believe that the moment had to be seized and shaken for what it was worth. Names like John Reed, Hemingway, the young Marlon Brando, James Dean, Jack Keroauc (and his mad band of associates, Neal Cassady, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso and William Burroughs), Jim Morrison of The Doors, Hunter Thompson and so on. Not all of them died young as Hank William did, although not for not trying, but they all listened to their own drummer and left a cultural marker on the planet.Of course Hank's niche was new style (then new style -okay) country music that shifted the beat from slow mournful old timey Jimmy Rodgers back road and Carter Family mountain-etched music to more contemporary and personal concerns with a jump band as back up. My connection, my tenuous and rebellious connection, to Hank's kind of music was hearing it waft through my growing up in the late1950s house in Hullsville south of Boston when my father, a son of Appalachia, would play or listen to old Hank and companions. I, a child of rock and roll insistent in listening  my own drummer, took a long time, a very long time to learn to appreciate Hank beyond my father's hard rock-etched  dreams.All this above as prelude to the simple fact that as a late-comer I was not privy to a lot of Hank Williams' life story and so rather let his music speak for him. So I was not aware until viewing this film about the manner of his death, although I had an inkling from reading liner notes on some of his CDs that he was another in that short line of wild boys who had to keep moving, had to keep pushing the envelope, had to live out there on edge city where the wild boys need to hang out.So the plot here is not what drives this film, hell, the title says it all, it's a cinematic recreation of Hank's last ride but what drive it is the bonding between an essentially lonely, sick man (at only 29 so you know he sowed some serious wild oats) and the last man who saw him alive, his young hired for the ocassion of getting him to his next concert chauffer.What drives this thing is the interplay between the two, between the country boy chauffer's coming of age and Hank's tumble into that die young good night. Most of the interchange done inside that big old Caddy that was a symbol that one had arrived in the big time in America. And that simple plot interplay worked whatever the cinematic licenses were taken about the actual facts of Brother Williams' death. But see dying young for some guys (or gals) is only prelude, some sixty years later his songs like Cold ,Cold Heart that I heard like I said almost from the cradle still sound fresh. And the soundtrack here has some very good material acting as backdrop as Hank moves to that last long lonely ride.",4,The Wild Boys -Part 264,1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2013,3184,"['Live', 'fast', 'die', 'young', 'make', 'good', 'corpse', 'mantra', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'who', 'last', 'ride', 'premature', 'death', 'subject', 'film', 'review', 'ah', 'called', 'Last', 'Ride', 'lived', 'generation', 'niche', 'cultural', 'enclave', 'iconic', 'wild', 'boys', 'thus', 'far', 'mainly', 'wild', 'boys', 'things', 'even', 'wild', 'women', 'wild', 'women', 'sense', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'far', 'who', 'stirred', 'imagination', 'who', 'made', 'devotees', 'believe', 'believe', 'moment', 'had', 'be', 'seized', 'shaken', 'what', 'was', 'worth', 'Names', 'John', 'Reed', 'Hemingway', 'young', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'James', 'Dean', 'Jack', 'Keroauc', 'mad', 'band', 'associates', 'Neal', 'Cassady', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'Gregory', 'Corso', 'William', 'Burroughs', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Doors', 'Hunter', 'Thompson', 'so', 'Not', 'died', 'young', 'Hank', 'William', 'did', 'not', 'not', 'trying', 'listened', 'own', 'drummer', 'left', 'cultural', 'marker', 'planet.Of', 'course', 'Hank', 'niche', 'was', 'new', 'style', 'then', 'new', 'style', '-okay', 'country', 'music', 'shifted', 'beat', 'slow', 'mournful', 'old', 'timey', 'Jimmy', 'Rodgers', 'back', 'road', 'Carter', 'Family', 'mountain-etched', 'music', 'more', 'contemporary', 'personal', 'concerns', 'jump', 'band', 'back', 'connection', 'tenuous', 'rebellious', 'connection', 'Hank', 'kind', 'music', 'was', 'hearing', 'growing', 'up', 'late1950s', 'house', 'Hullsville', 'south', 'Boston', 'when', 'father', 'son', 'Appalachia', 'would', 'play', 'listen', 'old', 'Hank', 'companions', 'child', 'rock', 'roll', 'insistent', 'listening', 'own', 'drummer', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'Hank', 'father', 'hard', 'rock-etched', 'dreams.All', 'as', 'prelude', 'simple', 'fact', 'late-comer', 'was', 'not', 'privy', 'lot', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'life', 'story', 'so', 'rather', 'let', 'music', 'speak', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'viewing', 'film', 'manner', 'death', 'had', 'inkling', 'reading', 'liner', 'notes', 'CDs', 'was', 'short', 'line', 'wild', 'boys', 'who', 'had', 'keep', 'moving', 'had', 'keep', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'had', 'live', 'out', 'there', 'edge', 'city', 'where', 'wild', 'boys', 'need', 'hang', 'out.So', 'plot', 'here', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'hell', 'title', 'cinematic', 'recreation', 'Hank', 'last', 'ride', 'what', 'drive', 'bonding', 'essentially', 'lonely', 'sick', 'man', 'only', '29', 'so', 'know', 'sowed', 'serious', 'wild', 'oats', 'last', 'man', 'who', 'saw', 'alive', 'young', 'hired', 'ocassion', 'getting', 'next', 'concert', 'chauffer.What', 'thing', 'interplay', 'two', 'country', 'boy', 'chauffer', 'coming', 'age', 'Hank', 'tumble', 'die', 'young', 'good', 'night', 'Most', 'interchange', 'done', 'big', 'old', 'Caddy', 'was', 'symbol', 'one', 'had', 'arrived', 'big', 'time', 'America', 'simple', 'plot', 'interplay', 'worked', 'cinematic', 'licenses', 'were', 'taken', 'actual', 'facts', 'Brother', 'Williams', 'death', 'see', 'dying', 'young', 'guys', 'gals', 'only', 'prelude', 'sixty', 'years', 'later', 'songs', 'Cold', 'Cold', 'Heart', 'heard', 'said', 'almost', 'cradle', 'still', 'sound', 'fresh', 'soundtrack', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'material', 'acting', 'as', 'backdrop', 'Hank', 'last', 'long', 'lonely', 'ride']",The Last Ride

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[13, 13]","I admit that I'm not an expert on Hank Williams though I think I've reviewed every reissue of his music over the last 15 years and I got the soundtrack CD earlier this year. I missed the film when it played in theaters and was anxious to see it on DVD/BD.  Overall I liked it, but don't expect ""Oscar"" winning performances. It was pretty much independently produced in 2010 but didn't get a distributor (Fox) until 2012. And it took till this year (2013) to get to home video.You'll hear a lot about Hank Williams in the review but not hear his name mentioned in the film - except on the radio. Even the intro refers to ""Luke the Drifter"", Williams ""alter-ego"". And the screen says ""Based on a true story"" at the beginning but in the bonus feature (more on that in a minute) they say that most of it is fiction. I don't think I'm giving anything away ( I hate spoilers too) by saying that ""Luke"" dies in the back of his Cadillac, and that is true. Whether anyone else was inside is not known for certain.The film features lots of music including alol Hank Williams' hits as well as new songs performed by a band, whose members I didn't recognize. Of the musicians on the score, I did recognize one name, Jimmy Capps, who is a regular on Larry Black's ""Country's Family Reunion"" TV show. So country and Hank fans will enjoy this.Hank/Luke is played by Henry Thomas - who has certainly grown since he starred in ""E.T.""! I think he overdoes the ""drunken""  thing but not enough to dissuade folks from seeing this. If you spot Kaley Cuoco's name on the package and lover her - as I do - from The Big Bang Theory, you will find that she doesn't appear until 2/3 of the way through the film and doesn't get a lot of screen time. So don't come here expecting a lot of Kaley.The sole bonus - at least on the Bluray-  is a 6 minute  featurette "" A  Look Inside The Last Ride"", which contains interviews from three of the cast members but not the Director or Screenwriter. I'm not sure it added much. And, unlike the film which is in widescreen 1.78:1 screen ratio, the bonus is in full screen aspect. Strange.So I give the film a ""thumbs up"" because it's entertaining and worth a watch. But, know going in, that is not a factual biography.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,Review of Bluray- Fictional film on country music legend.
