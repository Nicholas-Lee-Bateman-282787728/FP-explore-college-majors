Take a neurotic, self-absorbed shrink who projects her own issues onto her patients and let the good times roll. Unfortunately, the show is unrelentingly crude and also focuses on Wentworth's idea of ethnic humor, essentially jeering at Jews. There were some laughs as the celebrity guest stars improvised with Wentworth as therapist but for me it wasn't enough to sustain interest.I suspect if Ali Wentworth were not George Stephanopoulos' wife, and therefore part of the ""elite"", this show would not have seen daylight.",1,SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING BETTER,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,601,"['show', 'was', 'built', 'good', 'idea', 'created', 'starring', 'Ali', 'Wentworth', 'Take', 'neurotic', 'self-absorbed', 'shrink', 'who', 'projects', 'own', 'issues', 'patients', 'let', 'good', 'times', 'roll', 'Unfortunately', 'show', 'unrelentingly', 'crude', 'also', 'Wentworth', 'idea', 'ethnic', 'humor', 'essentially', 'jeering', 'Jews', 'were', 'laughs', 'celebrity', 'guest', 'stars', 'improvised', 'Wentworth', 'therapist', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'sustain', 'interest.I', 'suspect', 'Ali', 'Wentworth', 'were', 'not', 'George', 'Stephanopoulos', 'wife', 'therefore', 'part', 'elite', 'show', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'daylight']",N/A
