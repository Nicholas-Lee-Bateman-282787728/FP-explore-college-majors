I then saw it again in the 80's on TV and was hooked on the story it told. Today as a student of modern history and University Lecturer of International Relations, I have a fascination with this period of history. Having studied in Prague and having listened to the tales of what the Nazis did to the peoples of what is now Czech Republic and Slovakia I wanted to buy this film to watch the killing of Heydrick one more time. I also have a historical fascination with Heydrick, as he was probably the man most likely to have replaced Hitler if the Nazi State had succeeded in its ambitions and had not collapsed in 1945. I searched for many years to try and get a copy of this film and finally bought it on Amazon.This film tells the fascinating story of the assassination of one of the key men in the Nazi regime. It starts in England and follows the story of the brave Czech soldiers who were airlifted into the Czech Protectorate with the one aim of assassination. The story it tells is one of bravery and then mass murder, as the Nazi regime systematically goes about terrorising the nation until it finds the killers. There are some factual errors but they do not detract from the story.The film itself was obviously shot on a low budget and filmed predominantly in Prague itself. The acting of Anton Diffring is suburb and you do feel he is Heydrick. Despite its low budget the film tells a fascinating story and is worth watching.One word of advice, as stated by other reviewers, I bought a Korean copy where the German is not translated into English and there are no subtitles, which does distract from the film, as large swathes of Diffring's dialogue is not translated.Great historically based film which does stick closely to the facts.

This film is an absolute classic - based on a true story of how Czechs managed to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich, one of Hitler's closest friends.  Although this version was made in 1975, an earlier black and white version was made by the Czechs themselves in 1968 (I saw part of it on a documentary once) - and it looked as though the 1970s version was filmed in very much the same way as the previous version had been.  Like Tom Cruise's ""Valkyrie"" which has been recently in the cinemas, this is a true story that does not have a happy ending for the guys who were on the mission.  Like Valkyrie - however - the film does tinker with the actual facts .... in real life the assassins were dragged out of the church, tried, and then hung with piano wire.  Far too gory for 1970s film audiences, I would assume .... but the rewritten ending with the haunting music that plays over the final scenes it brilliantly written, filmed and acted (by Timothy Bottoms, Anthony Andrews and a pre ""Professionals"" Martin Shaw) and indeed does leave (even male viewers) in tears.  You also feel sorry for the hapless German soldiers sent into the church in waves to be simply mown down in a hail of bullets whilst their Nazi-supporting commanders waited outside to avoid the carnage. That piece of film music which plays in the final scene is one of the most dramatically poignant pieces of music for film ever written and deserves a CD release all of its own.  Shame on American and British DVD producers for failing to release this classic on DVD - and leaving it to other nations to do so.

Ferrigno ""firehouse444""","[8, 9]","Simply suberb dramatization of the events surrounding the assassination of much feared Nazi SS-Obergruppenfhrer and Acting Reichsprotector of Bohemia and Moravia, Reinhard Heydrich in May 1942. The raid was carried out by Czech resistance fighters, trained by the Britsh Army, who parachuted back into Czechoslovakia, and were further assisted by undercover members of local Czech resistance networks.A strong cast of predominantly English actors, with the exception of American Timothy Bottoms as the Czech commando Jan Kubis, and German Anton Diffring as the ice cold, emotionless Reinhard Heydrich all contribute intelligent and believable performances. The film is based on the best selling book ""Seven Men at Daybreak"" by Alan Burgess, and directed by UK director Lewis Gilbert who had previously demonstrated his flair for directing solid WWII drama with films such as ""Sink the Bismarck"" and ""Carve Her Name With Pride"". ( Gilbert was also a key director of three of the James Bond series of films )  Although the film was obviously made on a modest budget, it in no way detracts from the strength of the story and the manner in which the actors effectively recreate the atmosphere of fear and terror that the Nazi's brought to occupied countries.The film's final half hour is particulary moving and heart breaking as the Czech commando's realise they have been betrayed and the hordes of Nazi soldiers close in on their hiding place in the crypt of an old church. My only small gripe about the film, is that in several sequences there is German being spoken by the actors ( most notably by Anton Diffring ), however no subtitles are provided for the audience ?Definitely, a lesser known ""sleeper"" amongst WWII movies, ""Operation Daybreak"" is well worth seeking out for fans of intense, character driven drama.",5,Effective recreation of heroism in occupied WWII Europe,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,1817,"['Simply', 'suberb', 'dramatization', 'events', 'surrounding', 'assassination', 'much', 'feared', 'Nazi', 'SS-Obergruppenfhrer', 'Acting', 'Reichsprotector', 'Bohemia', 'Moravia', 'Reinhard', 'Heydrich', 'May', '1942', 'raid', 'was', 'carried', 'out', 'Czech', 'resistance', 'fighters', 'trained', 'Britsh', 'Army', 'who', 'parachuted', 'back', 'Czechoslovakia', 'were', 'further', 'assisted', 'undercover', 'members', 'local', 'Czech', 'resistance', 'networks.A', 'strong', 'cast', 'predominantly', 'English', 'actors', 'exception', 'American', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'Czech', 'commando', 'Jan', 'Kubis', 'German', 'Anton', 'Diffring', 'ice', 'cold', 'emotionless', 'Reinhard', 'Heydrich', 'contribute', 'intelligent', 'believable', 'performances', 'film', 'based', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'Seven', 'Men', 'Daybreak', 'Alan', 'Burgess', 'directed', 'UK', 'director', 'Lewis', 'Gilbert', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'demonstrated', 'flair', 'directing', 'solid', 'WWII', 'drama', 'films', 'such', 'Sink', 'Bismarck', 'Carve', 'Her', 'Name', 'Pride', 'Gilbert', 'was', 'also', 'key', 'director', 'three', 'James', 'Bond', 'series', 'films', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'modest', 'budget', 'way', 'strength', 'story', 'manner', 'actors', 'effectively', 'recreate', 'atmosphere', 'fear', 'terror', 'Nazi', 'brought', 'occupied', 'countries.The', 'film', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'particulary', 'moving', 'heart', 'breaking', 'Czech', 'commando', 'realise', 'have', 'been', 'betrayed', 'hordes', 'Nazi', 'soldiers', 'close', 'hiding', 'place', 'crypt', 'old', 'church', 'only', 'small', 'gripe', 'film', 'several', 'sequences', 'German', 'being', 'spoken', 'actors', 'most', 'notably', 'Anton', 'Diffring', 'however', 'subtitles', 'are', 'provided', 'audience', 'Definitely', 'lesser', 'known', 'sleeper', 'amongst', 'WWII', 'movies', 'Operation', 'Daybreak', 'well', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', 'fans', 'intense', 'character', 'driven', 'drama']",Operation Daybreak VHS

The Warner Brothers release, however, is only 106 minutes long, whereas the film itself has a running time of 118 minutes.  Perhaps the loss of 12 minutes of running time moves the action forward somewhat, but the film was made with some care and I myself would prefer to see the entire film, without cuts.  That is possible with an alternate version that is available, but unfortunately not with the Warner Brothers release of this very important WWII film.

This has been done to the DVD releases of The Big Easy and Like Water for Chocolate, and enthusiasts are still waiting for a release of Midway that includes the 20-30 minutes at the start about the Battle of the Coral Sea.

354973,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,6303082637,Richard Masloski,"[30, 32]","The main body of my review below was written before the Warner Brothers Archive Collection DVD release of the film late last year.  My comments as to the DVD are below the review.The recent ""Valkyrie"" and ""Defiance"" are not bad films at all - but they pale in comparison to ""Operation Daybreak"" in their depiction of  heroic strikes against Hitler and Hitlerism in every particular.  No film about the Holocaust or a Nazi-occupied country has EVER made me feel as involved, as claustrophobically surrounded by the madness of Fascism as this film.  ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" ""The Pianist,"" ""Sophie's Choice,"" ""Defiance,"" - all great movies dealing with lives controlled and stolen by the Third Reich - but compared to this film, they all come across as seeming like, well, what they are....films.  But this movie...wow...it transcends the artful feel of cinema and if ever a film did it, this one does - it makes you feel like you are there!  And the added glory is that this is a true story that follows the historic truth with very little liberty taken.  It is the ultimate study of Heroic Hopelessness.  The acting, the settings, the cinematrography, the absolutely hauntingly beautiful (and unrecorded!) music score, all of it - this is a MUST see.  I won't go into plot detail to spoil it for those who know nothing or little of this true story.  When I first saw it, I knew absolutely nothing about what would happen next.  That is the best way to experience this film (and all films, actually).  Suffice it to say that, as the credits rolled, I wept. I wept more tears after watching this movie than I've shed from all the other World War II films I have seen combined.  And that is saying alot!  And to movie score CD makers:  don't let this emotionally rivetting score remain in unheard oblivion.As to the WB Archive Collection DVD release:  I just watched it and am glad to have this fantastic film on disc and presented in a widescreen format. The image quality and sound are wonderful.  What is NOT wonderful is the pathetic presentation of this cinematic gem.  I couldn't believe it when I popped this into the DVD player and, lo and behold, no Menu!  No subtitles, no chapter stops, no extras!  While I rejoice in the fact that the film is available on disc...I am also appalled at the shabby presentation - or lack thereof - of this truly great and memorable film.  I always say - if you are going to do something, do it right!  The WB Archive Collection put NO thought or consideration in releasing this film - they just...threw it out there.  I have seen some of the worst movies EVER made get the royal treatment in their DVD presentation.  And here is a movie that - being based on an historical event - has not ONE extra!  There was a History Channel show about these events - and that would have been a fantastic extra (provided WB could have gotten the rights to it.)  But even so, no chapter stops!  Anyway, despite the flaws (the DVD case also has one of the worst covers I have ever seen; it looks more like a cover for a comedy!  They at least should have stuck with the picture on the VHS tape)...despite the flaws, see this movie!",5,A Masterpiece - and on DVD at Last!,1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,3178,"['main', 'body', 'review', 'was', 'written', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'release', 'film', 'late', 'last', 'year', 'comments', 'DVD', 'are', 'review.The', 'recent', 'Valkyrie', 'Defiance', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'films', 'pale', 'comparison', 'Operation', 'Daybreak', 'depiction', 'heroic', 'strikes', 'Hitler', 'Hitlerism', 'particular', 'film', 'Holocaust', 'Nazi-occupied', 'country', 'EVER', 'made', 'feel', 'involved', 'claustrophobically', 'surrounded', 'madness', 'Fascism', 'film', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Diary', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Pianist', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'Defiance', 'great', 'movies', 'dealing', 'lives', 'controlled', 'stolen', 'Third', 'Reich', 'compared', 'film', 'come', 'seeming', 'well', 'what', 'are', '.films', 'movie', 'wow', 'artful', 'feel', 'cinema', 'ever', 'film', 'did', 'one', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'added', 'glory', 'true', 'story', 'historic', 'truth', 'very', 'little', 'liberty', 'taken', 'ultimate', 'study', 'Heroic', 'Hopelessness', 'acting', 'settings', 'cinematrography', 'absolutely', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'unrecorded', 'music', 'score', 'MUST', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'detail', 'spoil', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'little', 'true', 'story', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'knew', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'best', 'way', 'experience', 'film', 'films', 'actually', 'Suffice', 'say', 'that', 'credits', 'rolled', 'wept', 'wept', 'more', 'tears', 'watching', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'shed', 'other', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'combined', 'saying', 'alot', 'movie', 'score', 'CD', 'makers', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'emotionally', 'rivetting', 'score', 'remain', 'unheard', 'oblivion.As', 'WB', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'release', 'just', 'watched', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'fantastic', 'film', 'disc', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'format', 'image', 'quality', 'sound', 'are', 'wonderful', 'What', 'NOT', 'wonderful', 'pathetic', 'presentation', 'cinematic', 'gem', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'when', 'popped', 'DVD', 'player', 'lo', 'behold', 'Menu', 'No', 'subtitles', 'chapter', 'extras', 'rejoice', 'fact', 'film', 'available', 'disc', 'am', 'also', 'appalled', 'shabby', 'presentation', 'lack', 'thereof', 'truly', 'great', 'memorable', 'film', 'always', 'say', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'something', 'do', 'right', 'WB', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'put', 'NO', 'thought', 'consideration', 'releasing', 'film', 'just', 'threw', 'out', 'there', 'have', 'seen', 'worst', 'movies', 'EVER', 'made', 'get', 'royal', 'treatment', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'here', 'movie', 'being', 'based', 'historical', 'event', 'not', 'ONE', 'extra', 'was', 'History', 'Channel', 'show', 'events', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'extra', 'provided', 'WB', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'rights', 'even', 'so', 'chapter', 'Anyway', 'flaws', 'DVD', 'case', 'also', 'one', 'worst', 'covers', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'more', 'cover', 'comedy', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'picture', 'VHS', 'tape', 'flaws', 'see', 'movie']",Operation Daybreak VHS

The former mentioned survived mainly because it was about Berlin, otherwise goodness knows what would have happened to that one. 'Operation Daybreak' is a true story that has survived but in both cases the music score has been lost. Both movies contain some of the most beautiful movie sountrack ever written.
