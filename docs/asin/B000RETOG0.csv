Basic story line, nothing spectacular but fun and of course it's great to see Ms. Eartha Kitt in film in her later years and she did a great version as the mother. Worth watching and like seeing shows that don't need all the nasty language and skin scenes that make up too many films today.  I like it very much. Ms. Williams is very talented and pretty as well.",3,Cute and clean,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,507,"['was', 'general', 'cute', 'film', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'career', 'chose', 'have', 'child', 'rather', 'then', 'wait', 'husband', 'then', 'later', 'love', 'Basic', 'story', 'line', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'fun', 'course', 'great', 'see', 'Ms.', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'film', 'later', 'years', 'did', 'great', 'version', 'mother', 'watching', 'seeing', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'nasty', 'language', 'skin', 'scenes', 'make', 'up', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'today', 'very', 'much', 'Ms.', 'Williams', 'very', 'talented', 'pretty', 'as', 'well']",And Then Came Love

1081116,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000RETOG0,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","**1/2Julie (the lovely and appealing Vanessa Williams) is a writer and a single mother who conceived her only child through artificial insemination.  When the boy begins having trouble at school, she goes in search of the anonymous sperm donor to find out if the man was really the Ivy League genius he claimed to be on his application.  Naturally, meeting him leads to all sorts of personal complications and romantic entanglements, especially since Julie is already going steady with a well-meaning executive who, in spite of all his protestations to the contrary, is actually every bit as commitment-phobic as she is.Despite a fair number of halfway decent scenes and an overall feeling of generosity and goodwill, ""And Then Came Love"" is simply too slick, too contrived and too insubstantial to rank as anything more than just a negligible romantic comedy.  For even though the movie earns points for neither sanctifying nor demonizing its major characters, the set-up and resolution are far too formulaic and pat to be taken very seriously.  Moreover, the performances tend to be a trifle rough around the edges, except for the wonderful Eartha Kitt, who steals every scene she's in playing Julie's high-strung, intrusive, and hyper-critical mother.",2,middling romantic comedy,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,1254,"['**1/2Julie', 'lovely', 'appealing', 'Vanessa', 'Williams', 'writer', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'conceived', 'only', 'child', 'artificial', 'insemination', 'When', 'boy', 'having', 'trouble', 'school', 'search', 'anonymous', 'sperm', 'donor', 'find', 'out', 'man', 'was', 'really', 'Ivy', 'League', 'genius', 'claimed', 'be', 'application', 'Naturally', 'meeting', 'sorts', 'personal', 'complications', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'especially', 'Julie', 'already', 'going', 'steady', 'well-meaning', 'executive', 'who', 'spite', 'protestations', 'contrary', 'actually', 'bit', 'as', 'commitment-phobic', 'fair', 'number', 'halfway', 'decent', 'scenes', 'overall', 'feeling', 'generosity', 'goodwill', 'Then', 'Came', 'Love', 'simply', 'too', 'slick', 'too', 'contrived', 'too', 'insubstantial', 'rank', 'anything', 'more', 'just', 'negligible', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'even', 'movie', 'points', 'sanctifying', 'demonizing', 'major', 'characters', 'set-up', 'resolution', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'formulaic', 'pat', 'be', 'taken', 'very', 'seriously', 'Moreover', 'performances', 'tend', 'be', 'trifle', 'rough', 'edges', 'wonderful', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'who', 'scene', 'playing', 'Julie', 'high-strung', 'intrusive', 'hyper-critical', 'mother']",And Then Came Love

Imagine her shock, then, when her now-six-year-old son, Jason, demonstrates his growing need for a paternal role model by misbehaving in school. Julie soon sets out on a quest to find the original sperm donor youngish, self-effacing actor Paul, hoping he will take some responsibility for Jason's awry behavior. Father and son do indeed forge a strong relationship; but in Julie's wildest imagination, she never expected to fall in love with this new acquaintance.
