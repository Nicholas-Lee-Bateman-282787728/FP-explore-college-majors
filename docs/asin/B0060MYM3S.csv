With no disrespect to George R. R. Martin, when I tried the books after viewing the show, I wasn't really a fan of then in written form, which may sound odd considering that the show is supposed to be pretty reflective of the books, but I found that the writing and the ways in which the characters are presented in the show versus the books came off differently.Wonderful show, and highly recommended once again!",5,Lives up to Season 1!,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,1281,"['Loved', 'second', 'season', 'definitely', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'would', 'completely', 'recommend', 'product', 'blu', 'rays', 'are', 'top', 'quality', 'was', 'thrilled', 'have', 'digital', 'copies', 'download', 'Season', '1', 'digital', 'copies', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Complete-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B00AB55BS0/ref=sr_1_1', 's=movies-tv', 'ie', '=UTF8', 'qid', '=1368277822', 'sr', '=1-1', 'keywords', '=game+of+thrones+season+1', 'download', 'took', 'over', 'week', 'iTunes', '.This', 'show', 'really', 'one', 'best', 'quality', 'have', 'come', 'really', 'long', 'time', 'writing', 'amazing', 'acting', 'amazing', 'characters', 'are', 'multi-dimensional', 'real', 'cases', 'inspiring', 'love', 'strong', 'women', 'Daenerys', 'really', 'show', 'what', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'fans', 'books', 'may', 'still', 'enjoy', 'show', 'disrespect', 'George', 'R.', 'R.', 'Martin', 'when', 'tried', 'books', 'viewing', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'fan', 'then', 'written', 'form', 'may', 'sound', 'odd', 'considering', 'show', 'supposed', 'be', 'pretty', 'reflective', 'books', 'found', 'writing', 'ways', 'characters', 'are', 'presented', 'show', 'books', 'came', 'off', 'differently.Wonderful', 'show', 'highly', 'recommended', 'once', 'again']",Game of Thrones: Season 2

Personally, I completely missed the first season, but started watching the second. It took about five episodes of ""compulsory watching"", but then I was hooked! This series apparently slowly gets to you. And poisons you? I mean, it's all just a fictionalized account of the Early Middle Ages, with some Roman orgies thrown in for good measure. Or...? ;-)It seems that the main weakness of the series (about a dozen story lines with characters whose number is legion) is also its biggest strength. It's difficult not to find *some* character that captivates you, if only for a couple of episodes. Even so, ""Game of Thrones"" probably wouldn't have worked without the previous success (until the last episode) of ""Lost"", which also had innumerable characters and a near-impenetrable plot.Personally, I'm fascinated by Tyrion, the manipulative dwarf who is actually one of the good guys. His philosophy is to trick evil people into doing the right thing - somehow, that squares with my own view of politics. Arya is another interesting character, and then there's Daenerys Targaryen, Melisandre and her pseudo-Zoroastrian religion, and ""The Others"" beyond The Wall. (The Others are coming!) However, I readily admit that I can't make out all the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, mercenaries and prostitutes...yet.Be that as it may, I will nevertheless award this quasi-high fantasy series five stars. But here's a prediction: George R. R. Martin will probably die before he finishes ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", making the last episode of ""Game of Thrones"" even less bearable than that of ""Lost"".

There's absolutely no way to skip them (menu button doesn't work, fast forward buttons don't work, stopping the disc then hitting menu doesn't work).  I PAID for these discs, I shouldn't be required to watch commercials for HBO every time I try to watch them.  I won't be buying any more HBO DVD sets, just because of this issue.  Do the companies putting these unskippable promos on their products really think that irritating their customers every time they put a disc in the player is good for business?Update - I wrote the above after watching just the first two episodes.  It turns out the remaining discs don't have the unskippable promos before the menu.  Still annoying that disc 1 is that way though.  Complaining about here probably won't do much good, but on the off chance a DVD producing company should be reading this - most people watching your discs would be more likely to buy other products you're selling if you put the promos as an option that can be watched from the menu, rather than ruining the viewing experience with these unskippable commercials.",1,NO ONE wants to watch those unskippable previews,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,1287,"['love', 'show', ""'m"", 'giving', 'DVD', 'set', '1', 'star', 'review', 'one', 'reason', 'one', 'reason', 'only', 'nearly', 'four', 'minutes', 'HBO', 'promos', 'have', 'sit', 'EVERY', 'TIME', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'absolutely', 'way', 'skip', 'menu', 'button', ""n't"", 'work', 'fast', 'forward', 'buttons', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'stopping', 'disc', 'then', 'hitting', 'menu', ""n't"", 'work', 'PAID', 'discs', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'required', 'watch', 'commercials', 'HBO', 'time', 'try', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying', 'more', 'HBO', 'DVD', 'sets', 'just', 'issue', 'Do', 'companies', 'putting', 'unskippable', 'promos', 'products', 'really', 'think', 'irritating', 'customers', 'time', 'put', 'disc', 'player', 'good', 'business', 'Update', 'wrote', 'above', 'watching', 'just', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'out', 'remaining', 'discs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'unskippable', 'promos', 'menu', 'Still', 'annoying', 'disc', '1', 'way', 'Complaining', 'here', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'good', 'off', 'chance', 'DVD', 'producing', 'company', 'should', 'be', 'reading', 'most', 'people', 'watching', 'discs', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'buy', 'other', 'products', ""'re"", 'selling', 'put', 'promos', 'option', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'menu', 'rather', 'ruining', 'viewing', 'experience', 'unskippable', 'commercials']",Game of Thrones: Season 2
1507227,A20IIR0422G3A5,B0060MYM3S,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[0, 0]","Lord of the Rings has ruled the fantasy roost for over 60 years, reinvigorated by the recent 3 part film version. Game of Thrones has much in common with LOTR (not the least of which is that Sean Bean gets killed off at the end of the first installment.) but as filmed works, there are a few really big differences, which are illuminating about the TV versus feature film medium, which has a far higher budget per hour of viewing time. The feature film can have many more elaborate effects, including truly epic battles. LOTR has two battle scenes which would exhaust the budget of a TV series year in that 30 minutes of film. So how does the small screen make up the difference. In a word, it is Sex. The earlier series ""Rome"" had at least one sexually explicit scene per episode. ""Game of Thrones"" is even more explicit, including at least one homosexual bedroom scene. The good side of this is that the lead cast is almost perfectly balanced (roughly 14 out of 30 lead characters are women, if you don't count the headliner, Peter Dinklage, who is in a class by himself.) This is a dramatic change from LOTR, which had only three women in important roles, and that was done by major expansion of Arwen Evenstar's role over what we read in the novels. So, even though I know LOTR has a lot of female fans, ""Game of Thrones"" is a far better narrative for woman's roles, mostly as advisors and behind the back deal makers and game changers for the make kings. There is even a full blooded queen pretender to the ""Iron Throne"".Regarding the DVD release, I'm really happy with the additions. Every episode has a voice over commentary, but some, from the writers, directors, creators, and lead adult actors is better than those done by the child actors. That is not to say their performances on screen are not first rate. Maisie Williams as Arya Stark and Isaac Hempstead-Wright as Bran Stark are both exceptional.And... Peter Dinklage clearly deserves the several acting awards he has received for his role in the series.

However, each can be appreciated in their own right.  I was greatly disappointed in how Arya is portrayed in the series.  She shows more initiative and guile in the book; I found her a little annoying in the series.  One of my favorite characters is Tyrion, played to perfection by Peter Dinklage and the other Jon Snow.  His (Snow) characteristics, I like are that he is strong and silent (meaning that he pay attention to what is happening and reserves judgement) with a sense of right and wrong.  I actually enjoyed the series so much that at the end of season 2 I had to buy all the books available in Jamaica on the  ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", as I could not wait to find out what happens in season 3. Though with all the changes, I am glad that I started with book 1 and not book 3 as I would probably be perplexed.  I am half way into book 2 and the book version is better in most ways than the series, however the battle for King's Landing in the series was excellent.

The first 2 episodes of the show were simply ridiculous. Every 15 minutes the drama, for what it was, completely ground to a halt in order to introduce the Bob Guccione Penthouse soft core porn scene, entirely inessential to the plot. In one case you had your now politically correct gay sex scene, in another your few rapes. At some point the directors and writers must have come to their senses because all the sex scenes disappeared - at the start of episode 3. At this point, naturally, the storyline, for what it is, began to improve. By episode 5 or 6 the show got dramatically better and by the end was excellent. But anyone hoping for a consistently excellent show ought to look elsewhere or at least have the patience to wade through the first few episodes.

Not only is this currently one of the most exciting and well-acted shows on TV, it's one of the best shows in recent memory. It can be a tricky task to translate a book to the small or big screen, but the creators behind GoT have really nailed it; the locations, the costumes, the imagery, the culture...it's all there. Much like Peter Jackson did with the LoTR trilogy, the show runners have picked all the right locations for filming and have made the viewing experience as authentic as possible.Above all, and what makes the show so great, is the performances given by the actors. Each role was cast wonderfully and there aren't any changes, in my opinion, that would make the show better or more watchable. I could try to name a few standouts but honestly the entire cast is undeniably great.There are several changes the show made compared to the original book, but at no point did I feel like it took away from the overall story. If you haven't read it, I won't spoil anything but there's some awesome storylines in this season, including Jon Snow's, Arya's, and Tyrion's.I know it seems like I'm being vague with this review.

1507301,AMFMVWHYF2Q6T,B0060MYM3S,D. C. Obraztsov,"[520, 671]","I LOVE this show.  Yes, I'm a hugeee book fan and don't appreciate all of the changes in the show, but overall I am a huge fan.Rating guide:Non-readers: 4-5 starsGeneral book readers: 3.5-4.5 starsBook purists/fanatical: 0-2 starsThis is a great show, but in my eyes it's just not as good as season 1.  It is definitely better compared to most of what is on television and the acting is superb and extremely well cast.  However, my problems with this season revolve around two main issues:#1) the severe deviations from the books that the D.B. Weiss and David Benioff have taken.  In the first season deviations existed, but mostly to the point to help with time/budget constraints.  The writers still generally stayed true to the characters.Season 2 is a whole different story.  GRRM has spoken many times of the Butterfly Effect.  The more the writers change things, the more the story is going to change in the long run.  With the huge amount of characters in the series, seemingly little changes can have huge implications.  While season 1 generally stayed true to the novel (which I gave five stars to), season 2 took a life of its own.  Many story lines were completely invented or so heavily modified that they barely were anything like the books.I know that television/movies adaptations MUST be different from the books.  However, I think it's crucial that the writers still accurately capture the essence of the characters.  When the writers started to play with the characters and get cute, I decided that they weren't doing it due to budget/time constraints, but because they thought they were *better.*  And they're not.#2) It isn't as nearly as good overall this season compared to last, REGARDLESS book deviations.  Storylines drag, some dialogue is so bad that it seems like it was taken out of a cheesy soap opera (cliches abound), there are really disjointed and awkward scenes, and they can't seem to do much else except have two people in a room talking to each other.  The pacing to me was just off this season.More in-depth look at my problems with season 2:*Important scenes and character arcs are modified beyond recognition.  While some changes must be made for the sake of adaptation, that's not true for everything.  There was no reason to completely change The House of the Undying scene, which was one of the most interesting scenes in the entire series to something that was so irrelevant and had nothing to do with a ""song of ice and fire.""  it wouldn't have hurt to use a little more caution with Jon's character as well, because his famous ""kill"" was confusing and its intentions unclear to many viewers.  Arya's storyline was not a bad one in the show, but looked like a Disney version of what was in the books.  I was looking forward to seeing the gritty brutality of it, and instead it just fell flat.  Robb Stark....I don't even want to go there.  It may be his storyline that infuriates me the most out of them all.  In the books he was a fool that I could sympathize with; in the show he's not only a fool, but a jerk (to put it mildly). I won't go into details due to spoilers and you may not understand if you haven't read the books, but his character is butchered beyond redemption.*Women are dramatically different in the show than the books.  The writers feel the need to make the majority of the female cast ""badass,"" ruthless, and/or bratty.  An example is Tyrion's whore, Shae.  In the books she is very obedient to Tyrion and very much acts like a prostitute (which she is).  She shows signs of cleverness, but most of their interactions are based on sex and lust.  In the show, Shae has a huge potty mouth, acts like a big ""tough girl,"" and doesn't treat Tyrion like someone of high noble birth in the slightest.  The writers think they are making a more complex and dynamic character by making Shae witty and rebellious, because that seems like Tyrion's type of gal.  However, nothing's ever so simple.  One of Tyrion's biggest weaknesses is his naivety in love and even though he *knows* Shae is at the root, just a whore in it for money, he can't stay away from her.  It's a richly layered story that doesn't need assistance from the writers.  They also changed Robb's love interest to someone completely different, and once again she was more of a ""bratty rebel.""  Dany is another character that is also much more cruel in the show.  The writers have no imagination when it comes to writing/modifying the women in the book.  And Sansa, one of the main characters in the books, is hugely neglected for most of the season.  I guess she just isn't ""cool enough.""Not to mention, Dany's entire storyline in Qarth was different.  Hardly any of it was from the books.  I understood and expected that, considering she was rather inactive for most of book two and her chapters were admittedly pretty boring, but instead of changing it for the better, they somehow managed to turn it into a ridiculous soap opera that made little to no sense.*Cheesiness.  One of the things I love about GRRM is that he is never a cheesy romance writer.  I DO enjoy scenes that show true emotion and express things I can empathize with, such as love for others.  I DON'T enjoy super contrived, cheesy romance stories that are so cliche and boring that not even my most ""hopeless romantic"" friends can enjoy it.  And there was just too much of that in this show, especially between Robb and a certain love interest.  The dialogue was just atrocious.  But David Benioff DID write Troy, so that explains quite a bit.*Two characters talking to each other in a room.  It seems like practically every scene is two people in a room talking to each other.  The writers don't seem to excel particularly well at writing group scenes, and like the one-on-one talks.  This is alright to an extent, but I think sometimes it makes it come off as a cheesy medieval soap opera.  Not good.An example of this is Arya Stark and Tywin Lannister in Harrenhal.  Charles Dance and Maisie Williams have amazing on-screen chemistry together and are a joy to watch, but they had their little back-and-forth banter for what....4 episodes?  It got a little old.  Arya is supposed to be going through a living HELL while at Harrenhal, not hanging out with Daddy Warbucks all the time.*All of the little mistakes.  A few mistakes is normal and expected - a ton is not and a sign of lazy writing.  These writers claim to making a somewhat faithful adaptation of ASOIAF, yet they continue to mess up religions, locations, and simple Westerosi facts the entire show.  And these weren't things that had anything to do with budget constraints.  Having northern men referencing to praying to the Seven for instance, is completely unfaithful to the books, and the only reason I can come up with them changing it is simple - lazy writing.  The Old Gods were already mentioned several times in season 1, so there is no reason to have men of the North praying to gods of the South.  A bunch of little things like that add up over time and seem like a disservice to book readers.  Most of us highly appreciate the little things in the books being acknowledged and done correctly.  Not to mention, these errors could be seen by even a non-reader, considering religions have already been established and explored to a degree in the first season.If you are a book reader and can completely separate the books from the show in your head, you can still enjoy this.  It's entertaining, suspenseful, and brutal.  It moves at a rather uncomfortably slow pace, but gains some momentum toward the end.  Also, the show is mostly very good at staying true to Theon's arc, which is one of the most interesting in the series.  The Battle at Blackwater Bay Episode (8) was also phenomenal, and written by GRRM himself.  It is possibly the greatest battle scene in television HISTORY.  If only he could be a writer in every episode!I would also like to add that GRRM does NOT have any sort of veto power or control over the script and final decision making.  He can loosely be called a ""consultant"" and has one episode a season to write, but that's it.  He has said himself that D&D; can do whatever they want (turn the characters to zombies or getting abducted by aliens is all within their right - HIS WORDS) and he can't stop it.  The show is D&D;'s baby, not his.  He doesn't ""approve"" or ""sign off"" on anything.  I know that D&D; probably for the most part kind of want to stay true to the books, but they DO NOT HAVE TO.  Proof is in my second comment - and that's in reference to the very faithful first season, not season 2.Great things about this season?-Amazing CGI and battle scenes, including the direwolves.  Grey Wind is fierce and Ghost is just beautiful.-Superb casting.  Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister, Conleth Hill as Varys, Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister, Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy, and the list goes on and on.  We also have the addition of Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth and many other new characters, and Christie as Brienne is just perfection.  She IS Brienne.-With a few exceptions, Theon Greyjoy's storyline was an excellent book to television translation. It's a shame how quickly the seasons have to move, because it's one of the most intriguing storylines in the entire series.  Alfie Allen also gave a stellar performance as Theon.-Brienne/Jaime scenes were classic and they have great on-screen chemistry.-The behind the scenes look at the Loras/Renly/Margaery triangle was very well done.And that's just a few.  It's great in MANY ways and is beautifully done on so many levels.I would also make a list of things that book purists wouldn't like, but that would be about 20 pages (not kidding).So, do I recommend this?  Definitely not to a severe book purist, but yes in general and definitely to a non-reader.  I personally don't enjoy the major deviations and wish they would stay truer to the novel, but it all depends on the viewer.  I'm not trying to say that this a terrible show, because it's not.  It's beautiful and I'm thrilled to see some of my favorite characters ever come to life.  It's simply just becoming more and more different from the books, and for some people like me, that's not appreciated.  Just remember, this isn't A Song of Ice & Fire this season, but a loose adaptation of it set in an ASOIAF world.  And not to mention, in my opinion this is a downgrade from the first season, book reader or not.I have faith though that things will become better in the future, however, because A Storm of Swords will be broken up into two seasons.  That will give the writers some more leeway and time to develop things (hopefully).  Also, we have some great new cast members for next season, such as Iwan Rheon (probably as Ramsay Bolton), Ciar&aacute;n Hinds (as Mance Rayder and played Caesar in HBO's Rome), Tobias Menzies (as Edmure Tully and was in HBO's Rome as Brutus [funny, huh?]), Clive Russell as Brynden ""The Blackfish"" Tully, Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell, and a host of other new cast members.  Lots to look forward to!",4,Review from a diehard book fan,1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,11139,"['LOVE', 'show', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'hugeee', 'book', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'changes', 'show',

I basically agree with her review, and to anyone reading this, please read the books first, then watch the DVD/recorded series. You will not get an accurate portrayal of the stories otherwise. The producers strayed so far the books, it was in a word, pathetic. The Undying scene for instance, wasn't anything like the book. There was so much more to Jon's story left out. The battle scene towards the end in the book, was nothing like the DVD. Tyrion was in the heat of the battle on one of the sinking ships, when saved by his squire, not out side the castle walls. There was no mention or sight of his famous chain in the river. There was so many important parts of the story left out, that to me, the series made little sense. The producers should have taken the time to write the adaptation more acturately and include a few more episodes if necessary, to get it right. Yes I realise they have a budget, but it's the old story, do it right, or don't do it at all.

Game of Thrones Season Two not only picks up where Season One left off, but carries us deeper into intrigue and betrayal and mystery and magic.Since so much of this show is based on very believable scenes of a society loosely based in the days of knights and sword-fighting, I was a bit worried about how it would work when they ramped up the magic end of things, but they did very well.  Not only are the special effects very well done, but they are tasteful, as well.The characters remain fascinating, some of whom you grow to love and some of whom you come to hate.  However, no one in this show is perfect and everyone has their part in the ""game,"" even if they wished they didn't have to.Tyrion, the ""half-man"" definitely comes into his own in this series as he shows that, deep down, he can not only care, but care deeply.  Joffrey, the current king whose backside polishes the Iron Throne is a horrid spoiled, cowardly at heart, and downright nasty little boy...yet the others who are vying for his position turn out to be not much better.  While, Theon realizes that going after what he thought he wanted has serious consequences that he never wanted.  All the while, winter is coming and Snow, up beyond the Wall in the North (beautifully filmed in a bleak, lonely, and ice -covered landscape)comes face to face with the worst nightmares of those of the South.  Oh, and about those dragons...definitely this season has built into it shades of what's to come.Despite the magic that crops up now and again in the plot, this show is very realistic in its portrayal of the best and worst of human nature.

1507381,A3G7W5O2OX8MTC,B0060MYM3S,"Grey ""b09boy""","[0, 0]","Season one was great. Fantastic, even. It contained very nearly everything one could wish for in a book to show adaption, telling the story faithfully while still offering its own unique take on certain features. And while season 2 offers some great continuation to that story, other sections miss the mark for a variety of reasons. Let's take it by region.King's Landing remains the highlight of the show. Tyrion's tale is easily the best done and is solid all around. Yes, there are adjustments to the book, but they fit well and truly serve the story. Sansa, on the other hand, suffers. During the season we see her mope around some, and for good reason. Mostly she's just there to showcase the cruelty of Joffrey, and that's fine. But so much was cut out. Her interactions with Dontos and especially Sandor makes for much missing potential in one of the more interesting storylines within the series, and serves to poorly set up the finale between herself and Sandor which could further haunt the series down the road. Despite this, the climax to King's Landing storyline is an absolute splendor to watch, consisting of an episode-long epic battle in which it becomes difficult to decide who to root for.Stannis and his storyline is of similar quality, but suffers poor editing. There are multiple occasions where a scene is placed strangely in order with the others, and much of the oomph is lost because of this. Premiere among in this is his inevitable climax with his brother, leaving off at a cliffhanger one episode only to resolve it somewhat anticlimactically the next when it would have been better to resolve and then witness the fallout the following episode. There's just so little flow between scenes despite how well they might be penned due entirely to the editing process.From here let's take a look at Robb, who takes a welcome deviation from the books so we can witness some of what he is up to. The scenes are welcome and the character continues to shine, but there's other issues present. The show decides upon taking most of his time to develop his budding romance with a camp follower, all the while other plots surrounding him are dropped. Greatjon is cut from the series and while Roose and Karstark are present, we never get to see the bond he develops with his troops or his more loyal supporters while Jaime's escape attempt ends up greatly diminished and somehow even more glossed over than the brief description we received in the books. So while it's nice seeing Robb more, it largely feels like wasted potential for the sake of telling a romance.And from here, we get to Arya. Now this story ends up a decent adaption, but it never tries to push much beyond that. It doesn't truly detract from the potential of her storyline, but following her travels with Yoren, things never come close to reaching her high in the books. Yeah, we get a small glimpse at the horror of Gregor and her budding darkness of the three kills she receives, and her interactions with Tywin are a truly interesting addition to the series. However, none of this reaches the grim hopelessness and depravity of the books, and the fantastic book climaxes end up cut entirely, leaving this all feeling more like an interesting little side adventure than a clever survival of a truly horrifying situation.Meanwhile, across the narrow sea...Dany's storyline is hard to judge. It's not as strong as her first chapter, and weaker as well to what follows, but that's sort of how it is in the books as well. Her book tale in Clash is dreadfully dull excepting a grand finale which would not translate well to the screen. In many ways they actually improve upon this in the show, creating some intrigue where there previously was none. Could they have done better? Yes. But they also didn't want to stray too far off the rails and that seems to be much of what keeps this storyline in check. End of the day, though, despite the finale not being as interesting as in the books (largely because that'd be impossible without outright spoiling the rest of the show) Dany's tale is actually stronger here than in the books. Though some characters do exit early, the development and intrigue is much more present and interesting.But now we go to Winterfell and here's where things begin really getting ugly. Theon tries, bless his soul, and becomes one of the great highlights of the season, but he ends up a shining point of light surrounded by filth. So much was cut down from Winterfell that there isn't much left for Bran to interact with and even those surrounding Theon just sort of end up dull and some of the changes don't end up making sense (like the ironborn's obvious and eventual betrayal when they would eventually have to face the likes of the remaining Greyjoys). Everything floats so much around how far Theon falls and kicking him while he's down that the actual intrigue to the storyline never sees the light of day, all the while the rest of the story has to run to catch up because so many characters who are supposed to be having an impact soon haven't even been introduced. That's truly bad storytelling there, when not only does what is presented not stand up, but weakens what is to come.If Winterfell weakens future storylines, though, north of the Wall tries its damndest to destroy them. Where last we left Jon he'd gone through a rather important character arc. He'd gone from spoiled brat with dreams of glory to a brother, friend, and protector. Someone who chose duty over passion. So where do we go from here? Well, the show tells us this tale of a an inexperienced kid in over his head, slowly learning what it means to follow. He screws up every chance he gets and generally causes trouble for everyone around him unintentionally. In the end, he begins a bantering friendship/rivalry with a cute wildling woman who is a joy to watch. Ok, a little pathetic, but certainly the storyline will take us to someplace he'll very soon redeem himself a little. Unless you have actually read the storyline and know just how much this one got screwed up. See, Jon doesn't need to learn to follow in the books, he already understands that. He was told this outright in the previous story and has been following to learn to lead his entire life. He's an obedient and hard worker that is chosen for the ranging (not begs for it) due to his training, background, likely eventual position within the Watch, and, yes, his connection with his dire wolf. Here he proves an effective member of the team, always learning and using the skills he has to the betterment of the mission. Where the show bumbles him through mistakes in an attempt to jumpstart his relationship with a wildling half a season early, the books are focusing on teaching Jon the depths of duty and sacrifice, of choosing the right man for the right job and the necessity of having to send men to their deaths in order to accomplish a greater mission or even just allow the rest to survive. It is a grim tale of survival and an interesting character piece...which is entirely cut from the show so we can get quips from a wildling. And the worst part? This character the show sacrificed this storyline for is going to be around awhile. We'll still be able to get these interactions. And that story of redemption you think may be coming? It's not. There's so much time between this point and any real chance at redemption for him that his tale of incompetence here will grow cold. What does this leave then? A kind of boring story where, getting down to it, nothing of particular note happens until the end and even then what happens is mostly just setup for the next season. Really? That's it?But then what's worse, you have all these promotions for the season and one of the highlights is the three horn blasts. Many know what's coming. We're eagerly awaiting it, eager to see what is largely glossed over in the books. The white walkers arrive. Season over. What? WHAT? All this season you're promoting this singular event only to leave it basically where the promotions left off and give us a cliffhanger? WHAT??? The books went into more detail about this fantastic battle and all we got from those is flashbacks from a guy who was cowering and didn't even participate. It's pathetic. You have this storyline that accomplishes nothing all season long and then, just when it's about to go somewhere, you cut out. Who wrote these sections this season? Who approved of it? This entire storyline wasn't just dull, it screws the story to come.In the end this season was enjoyable, but there are just far too many problems with it. Some parts are dull when they shouldn't be, others held back too much, and far too many important storylines are going to be running to catch up because of how weakly they were developed this season, often not even due to lack of time or budget restrictions due to casting or effects, but because they ended up focusing time away on scenes which don't serve purpose or otherwise go nowhere. In its own right the season probably deserves three stars, but when I see what could have been and how much it will screw things up for multiple seasons down the road, I think it's lucky to earn two.",2,"Interesting, but too much wasted potential and weakened storylines.",1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,9196,"['Season', 'one', 'was', 'great', 'Fantastic', 'even', 'contained', 'very', 'nearly',

1507387,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0060MYM3S,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[10, 16]","Winter is coming. War is here. Season 2 of the epic GAME OF THRONES rolls out ten episodes, expands on its cast roster, meets and then surpasses expectations. Somewhere lurking nearby, George R.R. Martin is cackling maniacally as his brain child keeps on getting lauded. I encourage those with a yen for full-on gratification to NOT read the books until the television show has adapted them. Sucks for me that I read the novels years ago and so what happens next is still seared on memory.Seven kingdoms at war, is where we're at. Sundry contentious nobles, nursing dreams of conquest, all playing the game of thrones, with Robb Stark shockingly emerging as a charismatic warlord. We track seven or eight anchor characters, and the wonder of the show is that it retains clarity and manages to keep us absorbed - to one extent or another - with each plot trajectory. I think one of the most eagerly anticipated characters is the sinister fire priestess, Melisandre, or as I like to call her, Miss ""The night is dark and full of terrors."" Carice van Houten portrays her with dangerous and enigmatic charm, and, even in a show packed with accomplished femme fatales, she stands out. And yet she's only one of several new and intriguing female characters introduced in Season 2. My favorite is probably the spunky Ygritte (played by a lively Rose Leslie). She gives Jon Snow's arc a much needed boost. Jon Snow and the Night's Watch, beyond the Wall, sort of needed to get a move on with their narrative. Even Joss Whedon is impressed with George R.R. Martin's strong portrayal of his women characters. Whedon may even be appalled by the frequency with which Martin kills off his characters. Or maybe not.So a sprawling cast sprawls on, too many to mention, really. It's a busy show. Inasmuch as someone in an ensemble cast can dominate attention, Peter Dinklage, fresh off his Emmy win, is that culprit. He takes over from Sean Bean as the series' predominant focus. I think we were all looking forward to Tyrion Lannister's arrival at King's Landing as the newly appointed Hand of the King. We realize that the imp is galaxies more devious than the foolishly direct and honorable Ned Stark. And, yes, Tyrion doesn't waste time carving out his sizable niche, bedeviling his adversaries by dint of clever retorts and wily strategies and a healthy bump of self-preservation and pragmatism. In a pit of vipers, Tyrion finds himself at home and very much enjoying the game. I say, pencil Dinklage in for another Emmy. One of my very favorite interactions are those between Tyrion and his fabulously sarcastic bodyguard Bronn (Jerome Flynn). Not lagging too far behind are those marvelous exchanges between Jon Snow and Ygritte and between the disguised Arya and Lord Tywin.There's only so much room, only an hour per episode, only ten episodes a season. To service new characters and new story arcs, several of the established characters get short shrift. I feel that Daenerys's arc suffers the most. The Khaleesi still wanders the desert, her lips all chapped, her tribespeople slowly dying around her. When she arrives at a fabulous desert metropolis, she finds herself quickly at odds with the unimpressed city council as she tries to gain support for her cause. I'm frankly disappointed in her lack of character progression. I'd venture to say that she even regresses some in Season 2.Cersei recedes into the background for most of Season 2 but makes a roaring comeback in the ""Blackwater"" episode. Lena Headey is always sensational when given camera time, exuding brittleness and venom and a sort of twisted maternal tenderness. We get the sense that Cersie has realized to her horror that she'd allowed things to slip away from her control. There's an unforgettable moment between her and her despised brother, Tyrion, - dang, I forget which episode but you'll know the scene - which pretty much encapsulates their relationship. In that moment, a desolate Cersei was in dire need of comfort and you could feel Tyrion wanting to reach out, but...GAME OF THRONES is currently the best show on television, good on HBO for going all in with George R.R. Martin's vision and sparing no expenses. Everything about the series is top notch, everything. The sharp writing, the exceptional cast, the production values, on and on and on. Even the sex and nudity are classily handled and work to propel the narrative. In Season 2, the magical elements ramp up. We glimpse a witch at work and her smoke monster, a faceless man, and revenants. In the backdrop hurtles a meteor, signifying mystical portent. And, as always, there be dragons. In a season comprised of magnificent episodes, the highlight of highlights is the effing brilliant ""Blackwater."" This is the episode to which the showrunners dedicated most of the season's budget. ""Blackwater"" features not only some indelible character moments but also the most number of wicked awesome kill scenes.And maybe now we can ease off a bit on Sansa. Turns out, she's not too shabby at playing the game.And that depraved boy king Joffrey... how much do you want to wring his neck? Even Carter Burke from ALIENS says Joffrey is a tool. Dolores Umbridge agrees.",4,"My friend played the Game of Thrones, and he got beheaded",1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,5195,"['Winter', 'coming', 'War', 'here', 'Season', '2', 'epic', 'GAME', 'OF',

Here is one amazing show that will immediately grab the attention of most people. Wicked teenage King Joffrey shows no mercy to friends and enemies alike and there is danger in the kingdom as several pretenders have a more legitimate claim to the thrown than Joffrey.Joffrey is the son of the deceased king of Baratheon clan but he is 100% Lannister though his mother and his biological father. Yes, we learn in Season One that the good Queen's children have all been fathered by her brother. We've learned soon enough that GAME OF THRONES is also a game of sexual misconduct - as if the political intrigue is not fascinating enough.Season 2 does not disappoint anyone who was hooked on Season One. The drama and suspense continues. GAME OF THRONES is not hesitant to shock or surprise us. We lost a lead character in Season One so expect more in Season 2. No one is safe and no one will find mercy. This is a time of fear and violence in Westeros. No one is safe and no one can be trusted. It is a chore trying to keep all the characters in mind and to remember who they are in the scheme of life..who is related to whom and who betrayed a trusted friend..no to mention who is having an affair with a secret lover.Peter Dinklage is a stand-out in Season Two. Tyrion Lannster, ""The half-man,"" as he often refers to himself, finds love and courage in Season 2. Tyrion is a dwarf who is barely tolerated by his Lannister father and siblings, yet he, alone, has a semblance of decency and humanity in his heart. The self-proclaimed coward finds the courage to fight for the Lannister Dynasty despite the evil and treachery of his nephew King Joffrey and his sister the Queen. Tyrion is redeemened in an absolutely amazing sea battle that is a keystone of Season Two. Tyrion's brilliance helps save the kingdom but praise will not come his way.GAME OF THRONES is amazing on so many levels. The diverse and beautiful scenery and real. The snowy wastelands scenes were filmed in Iceland and were not computer generated. The amazing crew is beyond brilliant and stunning. Again, the hard part of GAMES OF THRONES is keeping track of everyone. The blu-ray does have a drop down menu to give you information on the characters throughout the episodes. I found it confusing and distracting and hard to read from a distance. I felt the blu-ray had some flaws in its menu and presentation but GAME OF THRONES is brilliant and I am waiting for Season 3.",5,ALL HAIL GOOD KING JOFFREY...,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,2553,"['be', 'prepared', 'lose', 'head', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'THE', 'GAME', 'OF', 'THRONES', 'TV', 'theaters', 'Here', 'one', 'amazing', 'show', 'will', 'immediately', 'grab', 'attention', 'most', 'people', 'Wicked', 'teenage', 'King', 'Joffrey', 'mercy', 'friends', 'enemies', 'alike', 'danger', 'kingdom', 'several', 'pretenders', 'have', 'more', 'legitimate', 'claim', 'thrown', 'Joffrey.Joffrey', 'son', 'deceased', 'king', 'Baratheon', 'clan', '100', '%', 'Lannister', 'mother', 'biological', 'father', 'Yes', 'learn', 'Season', 'One', 'good', 'Queen', 'children', 'have', 'been', 'fathered', 'brother', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'soon', 'enough', 'GAME', 'OF', 'THRONES', 'also', 'game', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'political', 'intrigue', 'not', 'fascinating', 'enough.Season', '2', 'not', 'disappoint', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'hooked', 'Season', 'One', 'drama', 'suspense', 'GAME', 'OF', 'THRONES', 'not', 'hesitant', 'shock', 'surprise', 'lost', 'lead', 'character', 'Season', 'One', 'so', 'expect', 'more', 'Season', '2', 'one', 'safe', 'one', 'will', 'find', 'mercy', 'time', 'fear', 'violence', 'Westeros', 'one', 'safe', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'chore', 'trying', 'keep', 'characters', 'mind', 'remember', 'who', 'are', 'scheme', 'life..who', 'related', 'whom', 'who', 'betrayed', 'trusted', 'friend..no', 'mention', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'secret', 'lover.Peter', 'Dinklage', 'stand-out', 'Season', 'Two', 'Tyrion', 'Lannster', 'half-man', 'often', 'love', 'courage', 'Season', '2', 'Tyrion', 'dwarf', 'who', 'barely', 'tolerated', 'Lannister', 'father', 'siblings', 'yet', 'alone', 'semblance', 'decency', 'humanity', 'heart', 'self-proclaimed', 'coward', 'courage', 'fight', 'Lannister', 'Dynasty', 'evil', 'treachery', 'nephew', 'King', 'Joffrey', 'sister', 'Queen', 'Tyrion', 'redeemened', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'sea', 'battle', 'keystone', 'Season', 'Two', 'Tyrion', 'brilliance', 'save', 'kingdom', 'praise', 'will', 'not', 'come', 'way.GAME', 'OF', 'THRONES', 'amazing', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'diverse', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'real', 'snowy', 'wastelands', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'Iceland', 'were', 'not', 'computer', 'generated', 'amazing', 'crew', 'brilliant', 'stunning', 'Again', 'hard', 'part', 'GAMES', 'OF', 'THRONES', 'keeping', 'track', 'everyone', 'blu-ray', 'have', 'drop', 'down', 'menu', 'give', 'information', 'characters', 'episodes', 'found', 'confusing', 'distracting', 'hard', 'read', 'distance', 'felt', 'blu-ray', 'had', 'flaws', 'menu', 'presentation', 'GAME', 'OF', 'THRONES', 'brilliant', 'am', 'waiting', 'Season', '3']",Game of Thrones: Season 2

We've got a little girl wandering around the countryside just trying to get home, and what she does just to survive, and another young lady just trying to stay alive, living among her enemies.  We've got one little boy left in charge of the homestead and trying to keep the home fires burning.  We've got a young man trying to find his place upon the Wall and beyond it, and another who could possibly jeopardize his war for independence due to his hormones.  Add into the mix, two brothers who can't seem to come to terms, a trusted friend turned traitor, a stalwart amazonian female knight charged with the daunting task of protecting a prized prisoner, a red witch, dragons, emerging magic, a cameo appearance of a familiar face from season one, and an awesome season end shot of what creeps and crawls beyond the Wall.  This is a recipe you can't wait to sample when it's done cooking!The cast is amazing, but then, was there any doubt?  Who does not love the irrepressible Tyrion, (Peter Dinklage)?  He's accused of many things he hasn't done, but doesn't get the credit for the good things he has done, yet he always seems to take it in stride.  Close on his heels is Jamie, (wonderfully played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau).  Next to Tyrion, he's got some of the best one liners, ""Where did you find that massive beast?"" (referring to Brianne (loved that!).  Bronn (Jerome Flynn), is great as Tyrion's muscle.We get a couple of brief glimpses into Cersei's (Lena Heady) attempt at humanity when she laments to Tyrion about what her and Jamie's actions may have brought about.  But it's not enough to allow us to sympathize with her a whole lot, as she's still a hateful manipulative person.  Tywin (superbly executed by Charles Dance) is cold and unyielding, but delightful to watch.Arya (Maise Williams) is magnificent as she's thrust into an unknown world and tries to adapt as best she can.  Sansa, (Sofie Turner) although still naive in a lot of respects, is starting to use her wits somewhat, and knows the right things to say and do to keep from getting beat by her ""beloved Joffrey's"" henchmen, or worse.  She's learning the game. Littlefinger, (Aiden Gillen) and Varys, (Conleth Hill) are, as always, the snake and the spider. Both are wonderful in their roles.Bran, (Issac Hemstead Wright) tries to run Winterfell as best he can in the absence of his brother and mother.  At least he has Maester Luwin for council, as well as wildling Osha, and let's not forget his surrogate legs, Hodor.Jon's (Kit Herrington) oath and loyalty will be tested as the Night's Watch ventures beyond the Wall to gather information.  The constant badgering and harassing of Jon by wildling Ygritte is delightful to watch.  She definitely gets under his skin.  Robb does his best to continue to win battles and loses his heart, while Catelyn (Michelle Fairley) will do whatever it takes to bring her girls home.  Speaking of loyalty, Dany (Emilia Clarke) finds out who her friends are and who aren't.  We see a different side to the Theon (Alfie Allen) we've known, and see a much more sadistic side to Joffrey (Jack Gleeson), (me thinks the apple doesn't fall too far from this family tree).I am a ASoIaF book reader, (on book 4, a Feast for Crows).  After watching spellbound to season 1, I decided to pick of the books.  I'm glad I did.  Having watched the show before having read the books allowed me to put faces to names, got a sense of places and of course the magnitude of the ever imposing Wall.  It greatly helped in understanding this immense world known as Westeros.  Let me tell you, it can get confusing, it's that big!And, because it's so big, HBO had to streamline some events and/or characters.  Keep in mind, this is an adaptation.  If the show followed the books word for word, that would be boring, because we'd know everything that was going to happen.  At that point, why watch at all?  There is no element of suprise, such as there is now with these (what I feel is minor) changes.  This way, it keeps book readers on their toes.Some events which were not in the books are in the show.  Does that devalue the story of the books?  In my opinion, no... not really.  While interaction between Arya and Tywin never took place in the book, I loved the fact their paths crossed in the show, and personally that's an event which would have played out well in the book.  The scene of the council of 13 in Qarth with Pyat Pree was fabulous, and I could have easily seen it as part of the book.  True, there was no ""weasel soup"" but with an undertaking of this massive size, some events just have to go, some characters have to do double duty to knit the storyline together.  Yes, they've deviated from the sacred books, but I do understand the necessity of it.A couple of places in the show were muddied just a little bit.  They should have gone more in depth and been more succinct over the importance of Arya's ""list"", as well as clarifying what was happening between Qhorin Halfhand and Jon.  It can be a bit confusing to non-book readers. While I thought they could have done the House of the Undying a bit better, it was nice to see a familiar face.  Other than that, I've got no complaints about the season.  The story and our characters progressed, some a little more than others.  Even with the changes and deviations, this is by far, the best show out there.  It bites that we have to wait almost a year before season 3.Definitely a keeper.

1507405,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0060MYM3S,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[3, 7]","My review of the previous season of GAME OF THRONES was that it was really good, but did have some glaring problems, such as how the characters of the Lannisters, particularly Jaime, who just seemed to be, for the most part, intensely unlikable villains with no real reason to exist other than to hate.I was very glad to see that problem was cleared up in the second season, which is superior to the first in just about every way.I might get into some spoiler-ish territory here, so tread lightly.Now, I am coming at this from the perspective of someone who hasn't read the books, so I'm not going to get too heavily into specifics of what I think didn't work, because there still were some problems. The most glaring issue to me was that of the relationship between Robb and Talisa, but there's so much going on here that I'm willing to overlook the speed in which their relationship grows from slightly adversarial to nuptual. I'm assuming that certain plot points needed to be handled with a degree of expediancy to catch up with the rest of the story, which is unfolding slower in some areas but with greater effect.The change of allegiance of Theon Greyjoy also seems a tad forced from a dramatic point of view, but again, this could very much be a product of the world these characters live in, rather than a more modern world.The adventure of Jon Snow beyond the Wall is really riveting, and I'm very much looking forward to the appearance of Mance Rayder.The various troubles of of Arya and Sansa are also very compelling, and I am absolutely in love with Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister.Of course, while the cast does really compelling work, it's ultimately raised to that AMAZEBALLS level by Peter Dinklage, fully embracing his top billing on the program and episode after episode crushing the role of Tyrion Lannister. While his work continues to stun, also much credit needs to go to Alan Taylor, director of many of the episodes of this show. While he's now just breaking into feature films with the next THOR feature, we have a veteran of feature film coming and lending his expertise to what is by far the best episode of this season.That director is Neil Marshall (DOG SOLDIERS, THE DESCENT, DOOMSDAY, CENTURION) and that episode is ""Blackwater"" as the forces of Stannis Baratheon begin their siege of King's Landing. It hits every beat it needs to, from the actual assault to Tyrion's St. Crispin's Day speech to the breathless last moments of the episode with Cersei, and it does it with such cinematic assurance that it's an award-worthy piece of directing.Also a big step up for the show is making Cersei and Jaime a little more three-dimensional (even though Jaime is still a tad less crisply characterized), and that's due in large part to Lena Headey and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Also still bringing majesty to her role is Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen, and Iain Glen as her most-trusted aide Ser Jorah is excellent as well.All we have to do now as viewers is hunker down and wait, since winter is coming.",5,Please can I have a direwolf now?,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,3033,"['review', 'previous', 'season', 'GAME', 'OF', 'THRONES', 'was', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'did', 'have', 'glaring', 'problems', 'such', 'how', 'characters', 'Lannisters', 'particularly', 'Jaime', 'who', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'most', 'part', 'intensely', 'unlikable', 'villains', 'real', 'reason', 'exist', 'other', 'hate.I', 'was', 'very', 'glad', 'see', 'problem', 'was', 'cleared', 'up', 'second', 'season', 'superior', 'first', 'just', 'way.I', 'might', 'get', 'spoiler-ish', 'territory', 'here', 'so', 'tread', 'lightly.Now', 'am', 'coming', 'perspective', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'too', 'heavily', 'specifics', 'what', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'still', 'were', 'problems', 'most', 'glaring', 'issue', 'was', 'relationship', 'Robb', 'Talisa', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'here', ""'m"", 'willing', 'overlook', 'speed', 'relationship', 'slightly', 'adversarial', 'nuptual', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'certain', 'plot', 'points', 'needed', 'be', 'handled', 'degree', 'expediancy', 'catch', 'up', 'rest', 'story', 'unfolding', 'slower', 'areas', 'greater', 'effect.The', 'change', 'allegiance', 'Theon', 'Greyjoy', 'also', 'tad', 'forced', 'dramatic', 'point', 'view', 'again', 'could', 'very', 'much', 'be', 'product', 'world', 'characters', 'live', 'rather', 'more', 'modern', 'world.The', 'adventure', 'Jon', 'Snow', 'Wall', 'really', 'riveting', ""'m"", 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'appearance', 'Mance', 'Rayder.The', 'various', 'troubles', 'Arya', 'Sansa', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'compelling', 'am', 'absolutely', 'love', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'Tywin', 'Lannister.Of', 'course', 'cast', 'really', 'compelling', 'work', 'ultimately', 'raised', 'AMAZEBALLS', 'level', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'fully', 'embracing', 'top', 'billing', 'program', 'episode', 'episode', 'crushing', 'role', 'Tyrion', 'Lannister', 'work', 'stun', 'also', 'much', 'credit', 'needs', 'go', 'Alan', 'Taylor', 'director', 'many', 'episodes', 'show', 'now', 'just', 'breaking', 'feature', 'films', 'next', 'THOR', 'feature', 'have', 'veteran', 'feature', 'film', 'coming', 'lending', 'expertise', 'what', 'far', 'best', 'episode', 'season.That', 'director', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'DOG', 'SOLDIERS', 'THE', 'DESCENT', 'DOOMSDAY', 'CENTURION', 'episode', 'Blackwater', 'forces', 'Stannis', 'Baratheon', 'begin', 'siege', 'King', 'Landing', 'beat', 'actual', 'assault', 'Tyrion', 'St.', 'Crispin', 'Day', 'speech', 'breathless', 'last', 'moments', 'episode', 'Cersei', 'such', 'cinematic', 'assurance', 'award-worthy', 'piece', 'directing.Also', 'big', 'step', 'up', 'show', 'making', 'Cersei', 'Jaime', 'little', 'more', 'three-dimensional', 'even', 'Jaime', 'still', 'tad', 'less', 'crisply', 'characterized', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'Also', 'still', 'bringing', 'majesty', 'role', 'Emilia', 'Clarke', 'Daenerys', 'Targaryen', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'most-trusted', 'aide', 'Ser', 'Jorah', 'excellent', 'well.All', 'have', 'do', 'now', 'viewers', 'hunker', 'down', 'wait', 'winter', 'coming']",Game of Thrones: Season 2

1507428,ANFQPAT5AOMCS,B0060MYM3S,J. Hedgepeth,"[1, 4]","There are plenty shows that I love and are completely brilliant, and I can't say I spend all my time around GOT. However, GOT is the best show I have ever seen. The level of quality this show maintains is spectacular.The writing and story: Inspired by George R. R. Martin's ""A Song of Fire and Ice series,"" GOT revolves around a very creative and captivating world. I have yet to read the series, so I can't speak directly for its staying true to the series. Although, from what I have heard, it stays true. I also know that the author is active in the show and has even written some of the episodes. My point being, its a creative bombshell of a show. But beyond creativity, the writing, the dialog itself is fantastic. The most disappointing thing a great creative show can do is have poor dialog. It needs to be compelling yet realistic, and this show does not fail at either. Creativity and good dialogue, that is one of the most important characteristic to a great show.And of course the acting: For a creative and well written script to be successfully it needs good casting and talented actors and actresses. The cast is fantastic. There are some known faces and some unknown. However, even the smallest of parts do their characters justice. And there are those that excel even more than most.Lastly, a show has to be visually stimulating. A good show needs good special effects and directing. GOT is filmed in various locations in Europe; I don't know exactly where. The locations engulf you into the world of GOT, and leave you begging for more.Now this is the second season, so I suppose I should talk about how has progressed. I thought it was just as good as the first season. In fact, I thought it was better, but that is mostly because I like the direction it is going becoming more magical. Of course its more than that. Its the politics mixed with a creative world of wonder that never ceases to amaze.Oh, and a quick word about the packaging. Naturally, the amazon packaging was efficient enough. The Blu-ray package is beautiful. The cardboard cover has an image of the iconic golden crown. It evens includes a level of texture to the embroidery of the crown, which is nice touch. I also think the image is a better representation of what the show is about than that of the first season. Of course that's just my opinion.SPOILER-SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FIRST SEASON--The first season showed Eddard Stark. He was a major character, but I figured being represented on the cover made him pretty damn important therefore safe. Well, imagine my denial and shock upon his death. Of course, that just speaks to the shows compelling writing.Anyways, the crown shows the main conflict that this show revolves around.Now, as for the rest of the packaging, it was clean and seemed to be secure. The Blu-ray cardboard case did have a line along the spine like it was folded before it had even been opened. It was caused by the pocket where slips of info were stored which caused it to deform. It wasn't major but noticeable. Still not worth more than half a star on a 5 star scale.I also want to add how great a value this is. With a DVD, digital, and Ultraviolet copies in addition to the Blu-ray. At $30, its even cheaper than the DVD copy. itAnd here is a TIP to amazon buyers:when you go to the website to get the digital copy, select amazon. It will then produce a code (different from slip provided) to which you go to Amazon and redeem it. Upon redemption, it does not give you the copy, it gives you the money value credit--the value of the HD Copy season. It can only be applied to GOT2, so go ahead and redeem it by just clicking the one click button. Now, Go back to the site that you got the Amazon code with and backspace back a few sites and select the iTunes option. It will send you to iTunes and prompt you for the code which is the one on the original slip of paper. At which point it will process the entire digital season in HD.",5,I haven't ever seen a show equal to this.,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,3977,"['are', 'plenty', 'shows', 'love', 'are', 'completely', 'brilliant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'spend', 'time', 'around', 'GOT', 'However', 'GOT', 'best', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'level', 'quality', 'show', 'spectacular.The', 'writing', 'story', 'Inspired', 'George', 'R.', 'R.', 'Martin', 'A', 'Song', 'Fire', 'Ice', 'series', 'GOT', 'very', 'creative', 'captivating', 'world', 'have', 'yet', 'read', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'directly', 'staying', 'true', 'series', 'what', 'have', 'heard', 'true', 'also', 'know', 'author', 'active', 'show', 'even', 'written', 'episodes', 'point', 'being', 'creative', 'bombshell', 'show', 'creativity', 'writing', 'dialog', 'fantastic', 'most', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'great', 'creative', 'show', 'can', 'do', 'have', 'poor', 'dialog', 'be', 'compelling', 'yet', 'realistic', 'show', 'not', 'fail', 'Creativity', 'good', 'dialogue', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'characteristic', 'great', 'show.And', 'course', 'acting', 'creative', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'be', 'successfully', 'good', 'casting', 'talented', 'actors', 'actresses', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'are', 'known', 'unknown', 'However', 'even', 'smallest', 'parts', 'do', 'characters', 'justice', 'are', 'excel', 'even', 'more', 'most.Lastly', 'show', 'be', 'visually', 'stimulating', 'good', 'show', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'directing', 'GOT', 'filmed', 'various', 'locations', 'Europe', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'locations', 'engulf', 'world', 'GOT', 'leave', 'begging', 'more.Now', 'second', 'season', 'suppose', 'should', 'talk', 'how', 'progressed', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'fact', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'mostly', 'like', 'direction', 'going', 'becoming', 'more', 'magical', 'course', 'more', 'politics', 'mixed', 'creative', 'world', 'wonder', 'never', 'amaze.Oh', 'quick', 'word', 'packaging', 'Naturally', 'amazon', 'packaging', 'was', 'efficient', 'enough', 'Blu-ray', 'package', 'beautiful', 'cardboard', 'cover', 'image', 'iconic', 'golden', 'crown', 'level', 'texture', 'embroidery', 'crown', 'nice', 'touch', 'also', 'think', 'image', 'better', 'representation', 'what', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'course', 'just', 'opinion.SPOILER-SKIP', 'TO', 'NEXT', 'PARAGRAPH', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', ""N'T"", 'SEEN', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'SEASON', 'first', 'season', 'showed', 'Eddard', 'Stark', 'was', 'major', 'character', 'figured', 'being', 'represented', 'cover', 'made', 'pretty', 'damn', 'important', 'therefore', 'safe', 'Well', 'imagine', 'denial', 'shock', 'death', 'course', 'just', 'shows', 'compelling', 'writing.Anyways', 'crown', 'main', 'conflict', 'show', 'around.Now', 'rest', 'packaging', 'was', 'clean', 'seemed', 'be', 'secure', 'Blu-ray', 'cardboard', 'case', 'did', 'have', 'line', 'spine', 'was', 'folded', 'had', 'even', 'been', 'opened', 'was', 'caused', 'pocket', 'where', 'slips', 'info', 'were', 'stored', 'caused', 'deform', 'was', ""n't"", 'major', 'noticeable', 'Still', 'not', 'more', 'star', '5', 'star', 'scale.I', 'also', 'want', 'add', 'how', 'great', 'value', 'DVD', 'digital', 'Ultraviolet', 'copies', 'addition', 'Blu-ray', '30', 'even', 'cheaper', 'DVD', 'copy', 'itAnd', 'here', 'TIP', 'amazon', 'buyers', 'when', 'go', 'website', 'get', 'digital', 'copy', 'select', 'amazon', 'will', 'then', 'produce', 'code', 'different', 'slip', 'provided', 'go', 'Amazon', 'redeem', 'redemption', 'not', 'give', 'copy', 'money', 'value', 'credit', 'value', 'HD', 'Copy', 'season', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'applied', 'GOT2', 'so', 'go', 'ahead', 'redeem', 'just', 'clicking', 'one', 'click', 'button', 'Now', 'Go', 'back', 'site', 'got', 'Amazon', 'code', 'backspace', 'back', 'few', 'sites', 'select', 'iTunes', 'option', 'will', 'send', 'iTunes', 'prompt', 'code', 'one', 'original', 'slip', 'paper', 'point', 'will', 'process', 'entire', 'digital', 'season', 'HD']",Game of Thrones: Season 2

I'm not sure why an excellent story like this needed scenes of very graphic sex acts, includingacts of homosexuality, to enhance the story.

We could hardly wait for this second season to come out on DVD because we enjoy the show so much that once we start watching the series we cannot stop until we are done.  The season was very good and there was a lot of action, particularly in the last two episodes.This season spends a lot of time building on the plot and the inter relationships between the characters.  I won't go into the story line and give any spoilers, but let's just say that it was fun to watch.  My wife loved it and she gave it a solid 5 stars.  I thought it needed some more action in the early part of the season and that the last two episodes were spectacular. The acting was exceptional and the story just keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next thing to happen.While I love all of the characters, even the evil and the good, I particularly like Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) as this role is just special.  He possibly plays the smartest character and the best leader out of the bunch who are vying to be king and yet no one considers him to possibly be the king because of his size.This season is fast moving with old characters making great strides in achieving their goals in the war and new characters coming into the story.

The story continues the efforts of Rob Stark to avenge the execution of his father, the journey of Jon Snow as a man of the Watch, the adventures of their two sisters, the Dragon Queen's trials and, in my opinion the most interesting of all, the development of the Lannister family runt, the dwarf, played superbly by Peter Dinklage. There are also several other new key sub-stories. The power of this series is in the extensive cast and this allows a lot of scope for killing characters off. This continues in Season Two but is offset by the inclusion of many new interesting characters. It all allows for the whole gamut the human condition to be explored. People make poor decisions and risk horrific consequences. There are battles, murders and betrayals. Alliances shift and new players emerge to replace those who fail.

Nominated for thirteen Emmy awards (among many other accolades), ""Game of Thrones"" proves that TV doesn't have to dumb things down or play to the lowest common denominator. To bring this massive story to the screen, certain liberties were taken with the source material but that's undoubtedly to be expected on a project so large. Thankfully, though, the creators and HBO did not approach things halfheartedly. Multi-layered and ambitious, this sprawling tale charts a powerful story of intrigue, political machinations, and violence amidst the brutal landscape of a nation divided. To do justice to the novel's intricacies required a massive cast, extensive period sets and costumes, lavish effects and a focused and intelligent screenplay. ""Game of Thrones"" has all that and much more.Season Two consists of ten episodes and portrays an embittered and embattled landscape. You might just need a scorecard to keep track of the major players in the early episodes as everyone seems to have a claim on the throne. With King Joffrey's birthright in question, both of the Baratheon siblings think they're entitled to their shot at leadership. Meanwhile, Rob Stark (and clan) continues his campaign against the Lannisters. And several unexpected events make former foes friends and former friends foes. Everyone is divided across the land, and that makes Season Two a particularly challenging event. This is not light viewing. When you settle down to watch an episode of ""Game of Thrones,"" it requires your full attention! But, the show does a remarkable job juggling hundreds of characters and dozens of storylines. It would be impossible to delineate the plotlines completely in short form and I won't try, but this season had many incredibly memorable moments. From supernatural side plots, to an episode devoted to one epic battle (an easy Emmy contender for writing and directing), to the long promised and stunning finale. It seems Winter finally is Coming!A true stand-out (apart from Sean Bean) in Season One, Peter Dinklage (coming off a Golden Globe and an Emmy win) continues to impress as the Imp Tyrion Lannister. But some of the supporting cast, due to the immense sprawl of the show, have had a chance to develop into richer and more interesting characters. Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark, Maisie Williams as Arya Stark, Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy, Richard Madden as Robb Stark, Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister, and Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon are all given more complex storylines and each is exemplary in taking on the challenge. Emilia Clarke continues to be one of the show's most intriguing characters as Daenerys Targaryen, still trying to reclaim her family's former glory while mothering her darling dragon babies. And Kit Harington, as Jon Snow, just might find out what lurks behind the wall.Once again, no commentary on the show would be complete without a nod to the technical aspects of the production. The show looks absolutely fantastic. The editing, score, and effects are as good, or in most cases better, than any comparable feature film. In a TV landscape filled with procedurals and reality programming, I'm pleased that HBO has expended the resources to produce something truly unique. ""Game of Thrones"" continues to be the smartest and best acted program on the air. It may not be for everyone, though, with nudity, language, brutality, and barbarism. But if you love and appreciate quality programming, I found Season Two to be even more ambitious, complex and rewarding than its debut year. The show currently rests at the high peak of the Metacritic scoreboard with 26 professional critics giving Season Two an average rating of 88/100 and it's easy to see why.

There may be a grain of truth to the accusations.  However, if the show wasn't so good, no one would bother.  Game of Thrones is the best series on TV, in spite of a few flaws.  HBO should hire the crew who put together that parody, because of their exceptional work, and keen perception of the material!Season 2 was fantastic, the highlight being Episode 9, written by George R.R. Martin himself.  It was like a top-notch feature film.The TV version of Game of Thrones is an interpretation of the original books.  David Benioff and D.B. White use their own expertise to bring the books to the screen.  It's not child's play. They are thoroughly familiar with the source material and bring it to life in an entertaining way.  Their work is groundbreaking.My only complaint was in Episode 10.  While I've been able accept CG direwolves and dragons, I was disappointed with the CG White Walker on a horse.  A cartoon isn't scary enough.  Hopefully, the production team can come up with a better idea...Meanwhile, fans are anticipating a great Season 3.

1507559,AK1298ALMMYK0,B0060MYM3S,Mushroom Samba~,"[0, 1]","Reviewing this set feels like a repeat of season one, in that it is another excellent release from HBO.  They really know how to release a quality blu-ray set, from the handsome packaging down to the special features on the discs themselves.  Here's what you get -- All 12 episodes, each with commentary- Special features further exploring the world of Westeros- Digital copies of both the episodes and the special featuresAs usual the episodes look beautiful on blu ray.  The color, depth, texture, and contrast visible in virtually any given scene are downright stunning.  This is the hallmark of HBO blu ray releases, and I'm glad to see that the blu ray transfer for GoT season 2 is as amazing as it was for season 1.  The audio is also top notch whether it's quiet moments being shared or the raucous din of combat.The special features are pretty decent too.  The standout for me is the commentaries.  Each episode gets a commentary track but each track is different.  Some tracks feature writers/showrunners Benioff and Weiss which makes for a very technical, also very interesting, and information heavy commentary.  But then other commentaries feature the actors which are probably my favorite.  For example one commentary features the actors playing the Stark daughters, which is hilarious!  while another features the actors playing the Greyjoy children.  This variation keeps the commentaries from growing stale, is often hilarious, and feels much more intimate - like you're getting to know the people who make the show - than traditional commentaries.  If you're like me you'll find yourself re-watching the episodes then re-watching them again just to hear all of the commentaries.As to the other special features they're also quite nice if you're interested in exploring the rest of Westeros.  If you haven't ready the books, and I can't blame you if you haven't, these are probably going to be incredibly useful.  Locations, characters, families, and histories are provided for different locales throughout Westeros and Essos.  These special features are by no means comprehensive, but they go a long way to helping you understand more about this world, e.g. what is the significance of &#34;The Rains of Castamere&#34; when Bron sings it before the &#34;Battle of Blackwater&#34;, what does that say about the Lannisters?  Tywin?  etc.  Good stuff.Lastly you get some digital copies.  I'm not a fan of digital copies as I'd rather simply not watch something as opposed to watching it on a mobile device, but for those of you who dig them this is a nice bonus.  I am glad that HBO seems to be including these on all of their releases now, and it's nice to have the option of downloading them in HD or SD.  So there's that.In a nutshell the Game of Thrones season 2 blu-rays are the best way to watch and enjoy season 2.  I would recommend this set to anyone.  Period.

As others have already pointed out that HBO  took some liberties with the source material and added scenes that were not even mentioned  in the book and changed some characters completely mostly to titillate the audience. It is still a great show, however I wish they would stay true to the original story. I just reread the 2nd book again and it is pretty clear in my memory. (SPOILER AHEAD) - nowhere in the book do you find any mention that Lord Renly is gay. Nowhere in the book is any description that Joffrey (as evil as he may be)tortures 2 naked prostitutes - one apparently to death. Arya's escape with the assistance of the black brother does not come to a sudden halt by being captured (and most of them killed) at their first rest stop, as a matter of fact they beat the Lanister's knights back and NOBODY was killed - what happens later is another story. And there are more of these inconsistencies just in the first 4 airings of series 2. The story also gets a bit ahead of itself and I have to agree that viewers who did not read the books might find it confusing to figure out the new characters, which where not already introduced in series 1, since there is no explanation of relationships, different houses, loyalties to one or the other, etc., which might become clear later, but by then a few uninitiated viewers might very well have given up trying to figure it out.All in all I enjoy the series so far - just hope they do not get too far away from the original story - which happened with ""True Blood"", which is not recognizable any more in relationship to the books and frankly is getting just awful after a promising start.",4,Great with a few exceptions,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,1787,"['was', 'amazed', 'pleased', 'series', '1', 'especially', 'how', 'close', 'followed', 'book', 'base', 'review', 'first', '4', 'episodes', 'series', '2', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'HBO', 'took', 'liberties', 'source', 'material', 'added', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'book', 'changed', 'characters', 'completely', 'mostly', 'titillate', 'audience', 'still', 'great', 'show', 'however', 'wish', 'would', 'stay', 'true', 'original', 'story', 'just', 'reread', '2nd', 'book', 'again', 'pretty', 'clear', 'memory', 'SPOILER', 'AHEAD', 'nowhere', 'book', 'do', 'find', 'mention', 'Lord', 'Renly', 'gay', 'Nowhere', 'book', 'description', 'Joffrey', 'as', 'evil', 'may', 'be', '2', 'naked', 'prostitutes', 'one', 'apparently', 'death', 'Arya', 'escape', 'assistance', 'black', 'brother', 'not', 'come', 'sudden', 'halt', 'being', 'captured', 'most', 'killed', 'first', 'rest', 'stop', 'matter', 'fact', 'beat', 'Lanister', 'knights', 'back', 'NOBODY', 'was', 'killed', 'what', 'later', 'story', 'are', 'more', 'inconsistencies', 'just', 'first', '4', 'airings', 'series', '2', 'story', 'also', 'bit', 'ahead', 'have', 'agree', 'viewers', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'might', 'find', 'confusing', 'figure', 'out', 'new', 'characters', 'where', 'not', 'already', 'introduced', 'series', '1', 'explanation', 'relationships', 'different', 'houses', 'loyalties', 'one', 'other', 'etc.', 'might', 'become', 'clear', 'later', 'then', 'few', 'uninitiated', 'viewers', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'trying', 'figure', 'out.All', 'enjoy', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'just', 'hope', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'original', 'story', 'happened', 'True', 'Blood', 'not', 'recognizable', 'more', 'relationship', 'books', 'frankly', 'getting', 'just', 'awful', 'promising', 'start']",Game of Thrones: Season 2

I haven't read the books in awhile, so take that into account.First, it should be obvious that you really need to either have seen season one or read the first book before watching this season.I didn't think this season was that much worse than season one. However, there is a decline in the quality of the acting simply because we lost two great actors in season one and the several new actors don't measure up:Boring new actors: those playing the roles of Stannis and ""Yara""(Asha).Okay new actors: those playing the roles of Margery Tyrell, Davos, Melisandre, Balon Greyjoy (Theon's father), Craster, Talisa (a character invented for the show, Robb's love interest this season - takes the place of Jeyne Westerling), Jaqen, Ygritte, Xaro, Brienne (is she only 6' 3""? They make her look 7 feet tall), Pyat PreeOutstanding new actors: noneI didn't have any major problems with the actors of season one, only how their characters were written (for example, Cersei was too nice in season one. She gets meaner in this season.)Littlefinger - almost too nasty this season. Well, alright, season one firmly established him as one of the bad guys.Theon - People who haven't read the books will be confused by him. In season one, he appeared to be completely loyal to the Starks. Now, he is shown to be otherwise. I've read 4 out of 5 of the books at least twice each and still don't get his character. Does ""selfish traitor"" cover it, or is there more to him?Jorah Mormont- looking too old to be a potenetial love interest for Dany.Old Man Mormont on the Wall - not as respectable as in the books.Pycelle - the writers messed up the ""manhood"" joke.Arya - too old to pass for a boy.Other reviewers have noted the various discrepancies between the novels and the series. These may not be large enough to damage the story, but since we don't have the entire story yet, it's too early to tell.Features on the 5 Bluray discs(I haven't gone through all of these, so my advise is to avoid them until you've seen the episodes, to avoid spoilers.)-19 ""animated"" (motion comic style) history clips-these are about 2-5 minutes long and are told from the viewpoint of individuals characters, with their biases. This helps give the viewers who haven't read the books (or those of us who need a refresher) a lot of back history that they couldn't cram into the episodes. To unlock these, you have to play the episode through; if you fast-forward through the episode you won't be able to watch them. This feature is part of the-an In Episode guide, which also gives you brief descriptions of the characters in the scene you're watching, as well as showing where (on a tiny map) the scene is taking place.-War of the Five Kings- an interactive guide to the ins and outs of the war-Hidden ""Dragon"" eggs- So far, four of these have been discovered- each containing a deleted scene-12 commentaries-The Religions of Westeros- Martin and the writers discuss these for 7 1/2 minutes-Game of Thrones Inner Circle- roundtable discussion between 4 of the actors, Benioff, and Weiss-Creating the Battle of Blackwater Bay--History and Lore- the 19 animated history clips all in one placeFeatures on the 2 double-sided DVD discs-None.

I think a more assertive warrior type individuals were called for in these pivotal roles.  My impressions have not changes after two seasons.Religion played a larger role - or at least it was mentioned more often. Old gods new gods we shall see who prevails.The fantasy elements were more developed in season 2. Most viewers are aware, I'm sure, there is a fine line between truly frightening images and just weirdness for weirdness sake. So far I have been impressed - in this area less is better, I say.We saw more damp, dreary courtyards and castles - after a while one looked just like another. Therefore I was so impressed to see the city of Qarth with it's tropical settings and brightly clothed inhabitants. I was hoping we would spend more time in the magicians tower but, alas, a fiery puff from Daenery's dragons put an end to that!I do not subscribe to HBO so I am always a year behind the GOT released episodes. When I purchased GOT 2 it had been over a year since I had viewed GOT 1. I was lost! I did not want to jump into GOT 2 unless I was reasonably knowledgeable about who was related to who etc. I purchased and read an excellent guide ""Inside HBO Game Of Thrones"", not only was it lavishly illustrated but provided extensive background on the characters - more that you would learn from just watching the HBO films. Certainly I could have read the books, but then I would ""know"" what was to happen and that would take away from the pleasure of discovery.Fortunate folks watching GOT3! Well I have something to look forward too in 2014. I read on the News recently - 4/3/2013 - the GOT has been renewed for a 4th season - great!Why 4 stars?

There is so much porn in the show its ridiculous, it detracts so much from it. I've never been one to say this but I was hoping some regular cable network would show it like tbs and cut all of the crap out. Its so out of place feeling, its like this book i read once it was literately two separate authors, there was the actual author who wrote this wonderful tale and the book editor that added material to turn it into a trashy romance novel for women. And you knew immediately when the editor took over because the voice was completely different and because they used modern slang and language in a 16 century period piece novel. There are times nudity may make sense, like when  khaleesi steps from the fire unburned, of course all her clothing would. But HBO has this idea to turn every show into soft core porn frankly to get the male viewers in the target group of 18 to 34 to watch. I have had many of my friends say they find it weird and confusing to them, and completely out of place alot of times. And a few saying if they wanted to watch porn they would watch porn but they don't want to watch game of thrones for porn. They watch it because they like the story lines and many have read the books. And I know some people are disappointed with it feeling like the bad guy always wins but its because its not the good guy wining all the time which is what they are use to. George R.R. Martin was in my opinion saying look in real life bad s*** happens..you could have the most bad ass person who can still die suddenly..and it's predictable to have this main character the series is based on that somehow manages to live through all of these things happening to them...but it isn't realistic...And honestly is speaks of the periods in time such as the medieval times of europe where it was dangerous to be in a position in the monarchy cause your whole family could get wiped out for that reason or you could die of starvation if you weren't...it was a harsh world and so is the game of thrones world...",3,"Liked the story, minus the porn",1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,2124,"['story', 'interesting', 'enough', 'where', 'keep', 'watching', 'yet', 'skip', 'most', 'episode', 'just', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'porn', 'show', 'ridiculous', 'so', 'much', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'one', 'say', 'was', 'hoping', 'regular', 'cable', 'network', 'would', 'show', 'tbs', 'cut', 'crap', 'out', 'place', 'feeling', 'book', 'i', 'read', 'was', 'literately', 'two', 'separate', 'authors', 'was', 'actual', 'author', 'who', 'wrote', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'book', 'editor', 'added', 'material', 'turn', 'trashy', 'romance', 'novel', 'women', 'knew', 'immediately', 'when', 'editor', 'took', 'over', 'voice', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'used', 'modern', 'slang', 'language', '16', 'century', 'period', 'piece', 'novel', 'are', 'times', 'nudity', 'may', 'make', 'sense', 'when', 'khaleesi', 'steps', 'fire', 'unburned', 'course', 'clothing', 'would', 'HBO', 'idea', 'turn', 'show', 'soft', 'core', 'porn', 'frankly', 'get', 'male', 'viewers', 'target', 'group', '18', '34', 'watch', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'friends', 'say', 'find', 'weird', 'confusing', 'completely', 'place', 'alot', 'times', 'few', 'saying', 'wanted', 'watch', 'porn', 'would', 'watch', 'porn', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'game', 'thrones', 'porn', 'watch', 'like', 'story', 'lines', 'many', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'disappointed', 'feeling', 'bad', 'guy', 'always', 'not', 'good', 'guy', 'wining', 'time', 'what', 'are', 'use', 'George', 'R.R', 'Martin', 'was', 'opinion', 'saying', 'look', 'real', 'life', 'bad', 's***', 'happens..you', 'could', 'have', 'most', 'bad', 'ass', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'still', 'die', 'suddenly..and', 'predictable', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'series', 'based', 'somehow', 'live', 'things', 'happening', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'honestly', 'speaks', 'periods', 'time', 'such', 'medieval', 'times', 'europe', 'where', 'was', 'dangerous', 'be', 'position', 'monarchy', 'cause', 'whole', 'family', 'could', 'get', 'wiped', 'out', 'reason', 'could', 'die', 'starvation', 'were', ""n't"", 'was', 'harsh', 'world', 'so', 'game', 'thrones', 'world']",Game of Thrones: Season 2

1507628,A1BPCX5TX2HNRQ,B0060MYM3S,Russ Nickel,"[422, 485]","I am unthinkably lucky. My favorite book series of all time has been turned into one of the best television shows of all time.And I'm not the only one who thinks so! Critics love it, award shows laud it, and record-breaking millions of viewers are tuning in.The dialog is superb, flowing with hidden subtext, overt emotion, political posturing, unfortunate truths, nave admissions, and much more. And each line is perfectly acted! I don't know how they managed to fill an ensemble cast of this scope with such talented actors, but even the children are impeccable. Joffrey conjures uncontrollable hatred, managing to be one of the most contemptible characters to grace the screen, and at such a young age! I feel bad for that kid. There's no way anyone will be able to look at him the same again.Season 2 picks up after the shocking events of season 1, which I won't mention in case you haven't seen it. And if that's the case, what are you doing? Go watch it right now!The death of a monarch has left the land of Westeros in political turmoil, rulers declaring themselves kings on every corner of the map. As the inevitable war ensues, we follow the various leaders, rooting for the most honorable, but simultaneously fearing for their lives, for this is a dark show, and the most just cause is often the most treacherous. Our heroes do not have the strength of numbers, but rather the strength of character, and that does not win wars.The season launches us headfirst into this maelstrom of a power struggle, introducing us to even more characters than before. For people who haven't read the books, it may be a bit hard to follow, but the show does its best and usually manages to pull it off. The two newest additions to the battle for dominance are Stannis Baratheon, eldest brother to the late king, and Balon Greyjoy, father of Theon Greyjoy and perpetual enemy of house Stark.From the moment you meet these characters, you'll be awestruck by just how high quality this show is. HBO spares no expense, and their money is put to good use. The new sets are stunning, from Stannis's table carved into a likeness of all of Westeros, to Balon's fireplace, crafted into a giant Kraken.Back in King's Landing, we once again finds ourselves enjoying Peter Dinklage's Tyrion as he continues to cleverly maneuver the human chess pieces that make up the court. He's definitely this season's hero, and he strikes a perfect balance between likability, morality, and underhanded politicking. As the season goes on, even more people die, the stakes are raised, and a sense of impending doom settles across the land.If you love the realism of the series, you may be shocked when things take a turn for the magical partway through the season. Still, the sorcery is artfully done, and while it's a bit hard to fathom, there isn't much of it to get used to. By the halfway point, situations have become truly dire. War is most certainly brewing, the lands north of the wall promise ever-increasing danger, and the clash of kings continues.And what a clash it is! Episode 9 presents us with what is quite possibly the most incredible battle in television history. Only on HBO could a show achieve such heights. The tension of the women awaiting the outcome, the gruesome brutality of war, the chilling fact that no matter how much you prepare, in the end your fate is decided as much by random chance as by skill--it's all awe-inspiring. Whatever stalling the season might be guilty of is justified in this amazing episode.And it definitely is guilty of some stalling. Daenerys doesn't accomplish much, but the resolution to her storyline is satisfying. And even if you didn't think that was enough of a season final&eacute;, I have just one word for you: zombies. Or maybe two words: zombie horse.This is a show of deceit and of honor, of love and betrayal and politics, of war and the base desires of man, of monsters and of loyalty, of sex and lies and conniving. It is made with the utmost sincerity, doing service to the source material, and expands upon that material with brilliant scenes we could not have witnessed in the novels.There is plenty of violence and nudity, so bear that in mind, but that is not the heart of the show. Rather, those aspects serve to underscore the themes of the story. These characters live in a dark world, and they must make the best of it while they can. After all, Winter is Coming.UPDATE: Packaging is gorgeous, although the DVD case is somewhat flimsy, but what can you do? Getting the digital copy was super easy. I followed the instructions and downloaded all the episodes off Amazon Unbox without any problems, and was able to watch them on my PS3 immediately.

It seemed to me that the show strayed quite a bit from the book and yet it was still riveting and entertaining and somehow true to the original.Major deviations:Danaerys &#8211; The show&#8217;s changes in her storyline were the most effective since there was very little suspense in the book, where she was essentially trying to get someone, anyone to sponsor her trip to Westeros. The show changed all that and made her story richer and all the more dramatic.Arya and Tywin Lannister &#8211; In the book they never meet yet in the show Tywin Lannister somehow sees through her gender disguise and what more chooses her as his cupbearer. He is perceptive enough on that score and on the fact that she&#8217;s a Northerner yet doesn&#8217;t seem as suspicious as he ought to about her true identity. However, Tywin and Arya&#8217;s scenes are noteworthy in that you can see Arya&#8217;s begrudging admiration of him fighting against her wish to kill him. The show also makes a more realistic scenario of how/why she doesn&#8217;t name him right off the bat as someone she wants killed.Brienne and Jaime Lannister &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if this is going to be in a subsequent book or the show just completely changed everything but Catelyn Stark letting Jaime free herself was an eyeopener. The actress they cast was perfect!Robb & his lady &#8211; Again, I don&#8217;t know if this is going to be in a later book but I guess the young wolf should get a little play time for all his warring. Interesting development.Jon Snow & Egrid &#8211; The book hinted at something that might develop later but the show really fleshed out a more prolonged interaction which leads me to believe these two will be tangling really soon.Can I say how much I love that last scene of the last episode??!!!

The contents of this Blu-ray/DVD combo pack are great!  Not only do you get the high quality blu-ray version with a plethora of special features, but this also comes with the entire season on DVD as well as a code for the digital copy.  That's an amazing deal, especially considering there have been times when I've hoped to watch certain movies/shows but I only have a dvd player available and since not all Blu-rays are offered in a combo pack I don't have copies that will work everywhere.  This solves that problem, which is great for people that have multiple tv's but only one blu-ray player or perhaps people that have dvd players at work and are allowed to bring in entertainment while on shift.  I have noticed that some people have complained about not recieving the code for the digital copy.  I did notice that the portion of the package that houses the dvd's also has &#34;& digital copy&#34; printed on it, yet the code was located inside the blu-ray disc package with the rest of the paper booklets and advertising that accompanies this set.  I don't know if that is the case with the other reviewers or not, but I definitely recieved a code to download the digital copy.  The picture and sound on the blu-ray copy are first rate and it is a really enjoyable viewing experience on your home theater.

1507653,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B0060MYM3S,Sky,"[42, 63]","I went into the first season of Game of Thrones without having read any in the popular book series titledA Song of Ice and Fire.  By the end of the first season I was so captivated by the story that I decided to read the books.Upon reading Game of Thrones, Book 1 in the series, I was surprised and delighted by how closely the HBO series mirrored the 700+ page book. And it was really cool to have faces and persona with all of the characters...especially that of Tyrion Lannister played precisely by Peter Dinklage.I am halfway through (as of this writing) the second book (this one almost 800 pages) of the series titled A Clash of Kings and based on how closely the HBO adaptation has once again almost mirrored the written work, I probably will abandon the extremely wordy George RR Martin and just stick with watching the show.And the show is excellent. Season 2 has taken more liberties from the source material than I noticed with season 1, and some of the detail in some of the most memorable scenes in the book have been lightened a tad for TV (i.e. when Tyrion confronts Pycelle); but it's all good and obviously anyone who has not read the book(s) will be none-the-wiser. I suppose that a standout descrepany from book to screen is that the ages of several of the prime characters have been elevated from teen to young adult. I guess that HBO was not ready to push the envelope with all of the graphic material...especially the sex...involving teens.We all know the fate of season 1's main character Ned Stark, so this year's main character is certainly Tyrion (even though Tyrion really stole the show last year too). I had hoped that season 2 would continue with more detail of Daenerys' (and her dragons) plight, but there is clearly a reduced role there in season 2.The best story arcs in season 2 are seen through the eyes of Tyrion and Arya. You don't want to move from your seat when it's their turn for the screen. Tyrion's wit and banter are as sharp as presented in the books, and it's easy to empathize with Arya's perilous predicament and feel like you're right there journeying along side of her as one of her youngling companions. Tyrion and Arya's escapades are more entertaining to watch than anything on TV right now. (I will say that anyone believing that Arya is a boy is a tough sell that needs to be taken with a grain of salt for the first few episodes of season 2.)As per the book, you also see arcs presented through the eyes of Sansa, Catelyn, Jon, Bran and Theon. However some deviations from sticking to seeing through the eyes of the main characters are present in order to better develop certain characters and/or story lines.The HBO crew has created magic with Game of Thrones. It is must see TV for any fan of the book series. It's a fantastic drama aimed towards an adult audience, and any fan of the fantasy genre not watching this should be thrown into one of the Black Cells.",5,"How They Loved to Promise Heads, These Men Who Would Be King",1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,2922,"['went', 'first', 'season', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'having', 'read', 'popular', 'book', 'series', 'titledA', 'Song', 'Ice', 'Fire', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'so', 'captivated', 'story', 'decided', 'read', 'books.Upon', 'reading', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Book', '1', 'series', 'was', 'surprised', 'delighted', 'how', 'closely', 'HBO', 'series', 'mirrored', '700+', 'page', 'book', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'have', 'persona', 'characters', 'especially', 'Tyrion', 'Lannister', 'played', 'precisely', 'Peter', 'Dinklage.I', 'am', 'halfway', 'through', 'writing', 'second', 'book', 'one', 'almost', '800', 'pages', 'series', 'titled', 'A', 'Clash', 'Kings', 'based', 'how', 'closely', 'HBO', 'adaptation', 'once', 'again', 'almost', 'mirrored', 'written', 'work', 'probably', 'will', 'abandon', 'extremely', 'wordy', 'George', 'RR', 'Martin', 'just', 'stick', 'watching', 'show.And', 'show', 'excellent', 'Season', '2', 'taken', 'more', 'liberties', 'source', 'material', 'noticed', 'season', '1', 'detail', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'book', 'have', 'been', 'lightened', 'tad', 'TV', 'i.e', 'when', 'Tyrion', 'confronts', 'Pycelle', 'good', 'obviously', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'read', 'book', 's', 'will', 'be', 'none-the-wiser', 'suppose', 'standout', 'descrepany', 'book', 'screen', 'ages', 'several', 'prime', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'elevated', 'teen', 'young', 'adult', 'guess', 'HBO', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'push', 'envelope', 'graphic', 'material', 'especially', 'sex', 'involving', 'know', 'fate', 'season', '1', 'main', 'character', 'Ned', 'Stark', 'so', 'year', 'main', 'character', 'certainly', 'Tyrion', 'even', 'Tyrion', 'really', 'stole', 'show', 'last', 'year', 'too', 'had', 'hoped', 'season', '2', 'would', 'continue', 'more', 'detail', 'Daenerys', 'dragons', 'plight', 'clearly', 'reduced', 'role', 'there', 'season', '2.The', 'best', 'story', 'arcs', 'season', '2', 'are', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Tyrion', 'Arya', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'move', 'seat', 'when', 'turn', 'screen', 'Tyrion', 'wit', 'banter', 'are', 'as', 'sharp', 'presented', 'books', 'easy', 'empathize', 'Arya', 'perilous', 'predicament', 'feel', ""'re"", 'right', 'there', 'journeying', 'side', 'one', 'youngling', 'companions', 'Tyrion', 'Arya', 'escapades', 'are', 'more', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'anything', 'TV', 'right', 'now', 'will', 'say', 'anyone', 'believing', 'Arya', 'boy', 'tough', 'sell', 'be', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', '2', 'book', 'also', 'see', 'arcs', 'presented', 'eyes', 'Sansa', 'Catelyn', 'Jon', 'Bran', 'Theon', 'However', 'deviations', 'sticking', 'seeing', 'eyes', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'present', 'order', 'better', 'develop', 'certain', 'characters', 'and/or', 'story', 'lines.The', 'HBO', 'crew', 'created', 'magic', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'must', 'see', 'TV', 'fan', 'book', 'series', 'fantastic', 'drama', 'aimed', 'adult', 'audience', 'fan', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'not', 'watching', 'should', 'be', 'thrown', 'one', 'Black', 'Cells']",Game of Thrones: Season 2

It's s-l-o-w-e-r. I think a couple of days, or maybe weeks, passes during the entire season. Not much forward movement at all, but plenty of shocks and surprises.The focus is not on the same characters. It couldn't really be because many of the main characters in the first one were killed. This adds some interest, but sort of takes you on a whole different journey too. The characters change. Some, like Tyrion, seem to evolve with the changing events. Some, like Catlyn, make inexplicable decisions that are completely out of character. The new characters are, in many cases, odd additions. It feels a bit Twilight Zonish. (Just a tiny gripe- why did they cast Natalie Dorman? She's so Anne Bolyn in EVERYTHING. Blech).There is a lot going on. At times I thought the story jumped the shark as the fantasy elements are a bigger part of things now. Not sure I like that part. Dragons and White Walkers are fine, but it's gone off the deep end now. Still there are LOTS of brutal surprises that keep me watching. Just when I think, ""eh, it's time to turn this off"" something unpredictable and quite compelling happens. So, yes, it's a keeper.Just one more (odd) note. One of the things I found most intriguing is the way that this series does death. In most movies, they slow things way down. Fight scenes last minutes. There can be dialog about revenge, hate, or whatever before foes kill each other. Not so here. It's more realistic. It's ""slash, die"" with no fan fare. Life goes on around you and that's that.

Only Tyrion Lannister (Emmy award winner Peter Dinklage)seems to have his wits about him enought o try and restrain the sadistic stream that Joffrey demonstrates.The second season receives a stunning transfer for Blu-ray. Blacks are rock solid throughout. This is a nearly flawless presentation in terms of the quality of the video and is presented in 1080p, AVC encoded transfer (1.78:1). Audio sounds terrific as well with an active surround mix even during the subtle, dialog driven scenes.I have read about some issues with the packaging on this set here from other reviews but, aside from minor scuffs on the enclosed extra DVDs/digital copies (which are dual-sided and, let's be honest, most fans HATE dual sided DVD's)which are packaed in their own cardboard container, the set I received had all the discs and there was no problem playing any of the discs. I wonder if having BD-Live enabled MAY play a role in the issues with some of these discs playing (as that has been an issue before with some discs).Having said that, though, it might be wise to take a look (briefly so that if you haven't seen the entire series before you avoid spoilers)and briefly play all of your discs to make sure there aren't any issues.The special features are terrific and include the following commentary tracks:""The North Remembers"" - Executive Producers/Writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss""The Night Lands"" - Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy) and Gemma Whelan (Yara Greyjoy)""What Is Dead May Never Die"" - Writer Bryan Cogman and Director Alik Akharov with a secondary commentary track with Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), and Isaac Hampstead Wright (Braan Stark)""Garden of Bones"" - Carice Van Houten (Melisandre) and Liam Cunningham (Davos Seaworth)""The Old Gods and the New"" - Kit Harington (Jon Snow), Rose Leslie (Ygritte), and Co-Executive Producer/Writer Vanessa Taylor""A Man Without Honor"" - Executive Proudcers/Writers David Denioff and D.B. Weiss""The Prince of Winterfell"" - Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister) and Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark)""Blackwater"" - Co-Executive Producer/Author of Game of Thrones, George R.R. Martin / Commentary 2 with Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister), and Director Neil Marshall""Valar Morghulis"" - Rainer Gombos and Steve Kullback of the Visual Effects Team along with a secondary commentary track featuring Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen) and Director Alan TaylorThe quality of the commentary tracks vary a bit and, to be honest, I haven't had time to listen to all of them yet particularly the multiple commentary tracks but the three or so I've listened to have been pretty informative and provide interesting background including changes from George R. R. Martin's novel.Other special features include character bios presented with interviews of the various cast members, ""In Episode Guides"" which give fans (both those who have read and haven't read the novels) background on Martin's universe as portrayed in that particular episode and a terrific featurette on the Battle of Blackwater Bay.Additional extras include ""War of the Five Kings"" a featurette on those vying for the thorne as well as ""Game of Thrones Inner Circle"" a great roundtable discussion between the producers/writers and cast members about the evolution of the series and characters.""Religions of Westeros"" gives us the motivation behind the action for some of the factions in the show. There are also a number of ""Dragon"" eggs and I haven't found them all just yet.Winding things up is a fold out booklet that tells us about the various characters, factions on the show which also includes episode information.The set is handsomely packaged in a box and the Blu-rays are in an accordian style fold-out holder with, as mentioned, the DVD/digital copies housed in a separate cardboard container.The second season of ""Game of Thrones"" continues to be as challenging, involving and intriguing as the first with some unexpected plot developments. For those who have read the novels there may be some disappointment over how the battle on the bay is presented or the briefer presentation of Jon Snow and his ""captive"" wilding but, over all, this is still a terrific presentation of a terrific show.Highly recommended.",5,4 1/2 stars for the second season as the plot thickens,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,4572,"['second', 'season', 'Game',

1507720,A3M17XG8HL7JRF,B0060MYM3S,"Who Am I? ""Me!""","[0, 0]","Definitely not meant to be watched this children as it is full of violence and explicit sexual scenes.  This show is wonderfully written (most of the time) and expertly acted- which is so rare unfortunately for tv that it's popularity has soared just as the expertly written and performed Downton Abbey is.  You would think the popularity of such productions would get producers to see that talent in the writing room and in front of the camera is the thing audiences starve for most, but alas- for every one good show there seems to be a hundred that are terrible.I do love season two, but it moves a little slower than season 1 did.  There are even a couple of episodes where- dare I say it?- things get a little bit boring because there is long stretches of not much story moving along.  But even those episodes aren't bad and the acting remains great.  The full frontal nudity that seems to be required of every female actress on the show becomes a bit comical because there is no real point to it most of the time.  In all the sex scenes the women are completely naked (the young and pretty ones that is) while all the men seem to magically be able to screw with their pants and shoes on. Showing blatant inequality between what is expected of the male actors and what is expected of the female ones.  There is one very brief scene with full frontal male nudity, but it is not sexual and only done once. Also espite this being set in an age where women are expected to stay celibate until marriage (except for the prostitutes), all the unmarried women who are not prostitutes too often show to have no problem having pre-marital sex and quickly succumb when asked. It has gotten so that it's obvious the nudity is just the director and writers wanting to see a new actress's goodies so it takes you out of the production a bit. Perhaps a professional critic said it best QUOTE:  """"Sometimes Game of Thrones uses sexual scenes to shed light on character. But quite often, it shows naked women because it can. At times, the show appears to be trying to cover up clunky exposition with naked flesh, and at other moments, the vibe comes off as, 'Hey! It's HBO! Here are some boobs!'"" end quote.But here's the interesting thing... despite all of these distractions from the story, the dialogue is often so good and acted so well that it still remains an amazing show.",4,Not perfect but still excellent,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,2367,"['Definitely', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'watched', 'children', 'full', 'violence', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'show', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'most', 'time', 'expertly', 'acted-', 'so', 'rare', 'unfortunately', 'tv', 'popularity', 'soared', 'just', 'expertly', 'written', 'performed', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'would', 'think', 'popularity', 'such', 'productions', 'would', 'get', 'producers', 'see', 'talent', 'writing', 'room', 'front', 'camera', 'thing', 'audiences', 'starve', 'most', 'alas-', 'one', 'good', 'show', 'there', 'be', 'hundred', 'are', 'terrible.I', 'do', 'love', 'season', 'two', 'little', 'slower', 'season', '1', 'did', 'are', 'even', 'couple', 'episodes', 'where-', 'dare', 'say', 'things', 'get', 'little', 'bit', 'boring', 'long', 'stretches', 'not', 'much', 'story', 'moving', 'along', 'even', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'acting', 'great', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'be', 'required', 'female', 'actress', 'show', 'bit', 'comical', 'real', 'point', 'most', 'time', 'sex', 'women', 'are', 'completely', 'naked', 'young', 'pretty', 'ones', 'men', 'seem', 'magically', 'be', 'able', 'screw', 'pants', 'shoes', 'Showing', 'blatant', 'inequality', 'what', 'expected', 'male', 'actors', 'what', 'expected', 'female', 'ones', 'one', 'very', 'brief', 'scene', 'full', 'frontal', 'male', 'nudity', 'not', 'sexual', 'only', 'done', 'once', 'Also', 'espite', 'being', 'set', 'age', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'expected', 'stay', 'celibate', 'marriage', 'prostitutes', 'unmarried', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'prostitutes', 'too', 'often', 'show', 'have', 'problem', 'having', 'pre-marital', 'sex', 'quickly', 'succumb', 'when', 'asked', 'gotten', 'so', 'obvious', 'nudity', 'just', 'director', 'writers', 'wanting', 'see', 'new', 'actress', 'goodies', 'production', 'bit', 'Perhaps', 'professional', 'critic', 'said', 'best', 'QUOTE', 'Sometimes', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'shed', 'light', 'character', 'quite', 'often', 'naked', 'women', 'can', 'times', 'show', 'be', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'clunky', 'exposition', 'naked', 'flesh', 'other', 'moments', 'vibe', 'off', ""'Hey"", 'HBO', 'Here', 'are', 'boobs', 'end', 'quote.But', 'here', 'interesting', 'thing', 'distractions', 'story', 'dialogue', 'often', 'so', 'good', 'acted', 'so', 'well', 'still', 'amazing', 'show']",Game of Thrones: Season 2
1507721,A218HWVG3OAM92,B0060MYM3S,"William M. Feagin ""A thousand miles can lead ...","[0, 0]","I have read all five of the books in the Song of Ice and Fire series, and I have now seen both of the first two seasons of this TV series.  I suppose I could complain, like so many of the book readers, that too many details have been altered to one degree or another or omitted entirely - why, for instance, did they cut Meera and Jojen Reed from the story?  Or what happened to Stannis Baratheon's wife (homely, humourless, introduced him to the religion of the fire god) and daughter (afflicted with greyscale, best and only friend is the foole they brought from across the Narrow Sea to entertain the court at Dragonstone)?  Why does Robb Stark go after an entirely different girl than the one in the books (and who doesn't actually appear until the third book, A Storm of Swords)?  And the scene with Joffrey having the two whores beat each other savagely - is this necessary, especially if we already understood the character to be cruel and capricious, like his mother and &#34;uncle&#34;?But what would be the point?  We all know that our favourite books, when made into movies or TV series, will be altered, sometimes for the better (Shawshank Redemption, where the story was made more concise, and Fight Club, where it was given more linear continuity, are two examples that spring to my mind) but usually for the perceived worse.  Grouse though we may, this is what happens.  I think we can learn to appreciate a well-done story, regardless of the changes.And this one is pretty good, despite the changes I mentioned above.  The writers have still stuck mostly by the original story, easing back on the sometimes burdensome details George R.R. Martin included in the books.  The casting is impeccable - Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, for one, is absolutely perfect; Natalie Dormer plays Margaery Tyrell somewhat sexier than I'd pictured her in the books, but that makes her more appealing; Lena Headey really shines as Cersei Lannister - and the choice of shooting locations absolutely amazing.  Northern Ireland, of course, has been the stand-in for the North of Westeros; Iceland for the far North, beyond the Wall and to the Fist of the First Men; Dubrovnik, Croatia, has provided both King's Landing and some of the interior scenery of Qarth, with Morocco providing the deserts outside.  The story, of course, continues to be gripping, which makes me wonder how they're going to straighten up the narrative once they get to the fourth (A Feast for Crows) and fifth (A Dance With Dragons) books, where the continuity is stopped for a bit; half of ADWD takes place along AFFC's timeline (read Martin's notes in both books), so it's going to need to be tightened up considerably.  But I'm particularly looking forward to the third season, since the body count really soars in the third book and some drastic changes take place.

I love the HBO series which I find to be the perfect culmination of excellent casting and plot, beautiful sets and cinematography, and a haunting score.Since I don't subscribe to HBO, I waited almost a year for this series to be made available on DVD and I think it is worth all the wait.Season 2 picks up where Season 1 left off, with political turmoil within the Seven Kingdoms being the backdrop. With regards to the books, this season dramatizes the events found in the second book of the series, i.e. A Clash of Kings (HBO Tie-in Edition): A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two. One thing I have to mention here is that the series is not 100% faithful to the books but certainly worth appreciating on its own merits. I love the series for its strengths, independent of the novels. The series is to be commended for being able to capture the complexity of the inter-connected story lines, a spider's web of court intrigues, supernatural machinations, romance, and adventure, all of which commingle to provide viewers with one of the best small screen experiences ever. I consider GoT to the be one of the best TV series I've ever watched and certainly ranks as my all time favorite fantasy series.Btw, for those (like me) who like to develop a better understanding of all the characters and their specific roles in the stories, then there are several sites that do a good job of providing all the relevant background information -awoiaf dot westeros dot orggameofthrones dot wikia dot comThe boxed set DVD for the Second Season comes in an attractive package.
