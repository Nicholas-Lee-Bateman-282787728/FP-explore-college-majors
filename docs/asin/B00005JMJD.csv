619915,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B00005JMJD,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[2, 3]","Sylvia is a powerful and haunting film by director Christine Jeffs. Poet Sylvia Plath portrayed by the always great Gwyneth Paltrow struggles with suicides, depression, her insecuirty as a writer and a wife is all discussed here. This movie touches me to the core and i am not sure why. Something about it is so auhtentic and disturbing. Plath meets and falls in love with another poet Ted Hughes, after a 4-month courtship they decide to marry and continue working on their individual writings. Hughes exceles greatly as a poet while Plath struggles with poem after poem trying to find a ""theme."" Although much of the film's focus doesn't focus heavily on Plath's gorgeous poems, it focuses more on Plath's self-destructive marriage to Hughes. Their love for eachother is evident but eventually becomes strained by Plath's ever-growing worry that Hughes is unfaithful to her, which ultimately becomes a ironic reality. I am a huge fan of Sylvia Plath, she was gifted, torturted by the death her beloved father at nine, and still her loneliness and self-doubt could not be overcomed with her genius and her love for her two young children. Paltrow is perfect as always in her fragile portrayal of Plath. Plath would go on to sell million copies of her best volume of poetry ""Ariel"" but Plath would not be witness to any of this success, she killed herself on February 11, 1963 by lighting the oven and inhaling the fumes. If you are a fan of Plath, i highly recommend watching this film, great cinematography, great acting, and great story.

619916,A2DV9NNNS0Z31Q,B00005JMJD,"Alma Lavandeery ""Alma""","[2, 2]","I'd have given this movie 3 stars if it weren't for the brilliant performances of its cast. Despite an unforgettable portrayal from Gwyneth Paltrow of a haunted, tormented soul in a performance that is almost disturbing, the film glossed over Sylvia Plath's relationship to her art while focusing mainly on her relationship to her husband, poet Ted Hughes.The movie version showed collaboration between the two poets only during their courtship phase, with Sylvia losing touch with her art shortly after her marriage. However, biographies of Sylvia stress how, for several years during her marriage, and before its collapse, there had been a period of productivity and fruitful collaboration between her and her poet husband, where they both helped, encouraged and inspired one another. The relationship the-movie-Sylvia had with her poetry seemed marginal, and after her marriage, nearly non-existent.Was it that the film-makers, with eyes on the box-office, feared to ""alienate"" their average customers with any emphasis on poetry, so they decided to flatten out the story, believing that focusing on her mental disturbance and putting ""that bit about art"" on the backburner would sell better? Or was it simply that Hollywood is completely out of its depth whenever there is any depth to be dealt with?So, the-movie-Sylvia was this deeply disturbed woman, jealous of nearly everything her husband did, and her own relationship with poetry and her work was skimmed over and presented in a most superficial manner. Daniel Craig's performance was sophisticated, leaning more towards the portrait of an estranged husband rather than a womanizing scoundrel. Other supporting cast were excellent.If viewers didn't know much about Sylvia Plath, the impression they would get from this movie would be that she was a mentally disturbed soul, but not a serious artist.

The new book,American Isis: The Life and Art of Sylvia Plath, tries to parallel Plath with Marilyn Monroe(?) and the Egyptian goddess Isis who seeks the body of her beloved husband Osiris. Persephone, the daughter of the Earth goddess Demeter and wife of Hades, the god of the dead, would've been more an appropriate parallel. Or the self-destructive Phaedra of Greek mythology... whose tale Ted Hughes translated from the French inPh&egrave;dre: A Play""Sylvia"" has stunning visuals and a gorgeous soundtrack by Gabriel Yared. It potently depicts Plath's downward spiral into depression and suicide. Gwyneth Paltrow is a shallow Plath;it's not surprising that towards the end, she tells a poet friend that she's hollow. We only get the surface of Plath's personality. Daniel Craig brings more depth as Plath's husband Ted Hughes. He embodies Hughes' ferocity&machismo.; His fierce masculinity attracts Plath. Paltrow's mother, Blythe Danner, is excellent as Plath's mother, Aurelia. In one telling scene, Aurelia tells Hughes, ""She scared other men away. You're the only one who scared her."" The screenplay fails to mention Plath's other lovers... and while the movie has Plath&Hughes; immediately falling into bed with each other, it doesn't show how Plath pursued Hughes. In the movie, Plath discusses her suicide attempts in the post-coital afterglow. Paltrow's attempts to convey Plath's self-destructive nature come across as one-dimensional. Plath comes across as more of an attention-seeking drama queen than a depressive who struggled with her inner demons after her father's death. Craig's portrayal of Hughes is sympathetic. There are hints of Hughes' infidelity... from him kissing a lady at the beach to curling up close to a female student. The literary equivalent of Bond girls. Hughes is overwhelmed by Plath's self-destructiveness... their relationship has aSkyfallThe family life of Hughes and Plath is largely passed over. We see the birth of their first child, Frieda, and Nicholas suddenly appears. It's odd that we get to see the sudden consummation of Plath&Hughes;' relationship after a poetry reading... and later, Hughes with his mistress Assia Wevill (Amira Casar) The latter is frenzied&physical...; in contrast to the bedroom poeticizing of the former.""Sylvia"",in the ends, succeeds despite its flaws.

Then there's some vague mention of a transcript and suddenly they're in America, and married, no less.At that rate, it was impossible to empathize with either character without having already known about the history and writing of the two characters.Additionally, Sylvia's discourses on her attempted suicides come off as little more than bids for attention.

Let me point out first that 'Sylvia' is quite similar to the movies, like 'The Hours', 'Frida', in that it depicts the artistic career of a woman with love problems. For this reason, you can either get engaged with the movie easily, or you might stop watching it, because you've seen similar scenes before. But the Paltrow effect will probably cause you to choose the first option.To give some bit of introduction as far as what happens in the movie: Syliva Plath is a young poetess, who's been submitting her poems to magazines to receive a review. She finally gets one. But it's a degrading review, written quite harshly. At the magazine's gathering in the evening, Sylvia finds the man who reviewed her, and enchants him with her beauty. This man is Ted Hughes, who also writes poems, good ones. They marry each other. And this marriage is what the whole film focuses on, which is for you to see.The cinematography is dealt in a perfect fashion, I'm still amazed at how well they revive the old years in the movies. Details such as Louis Armstrong playing on the small radio in the kitchen, Sylvia's mother telling Sylvia of the fold at the bottom of her dress, german words which are squeezed into conversations such as 'Ubermensch' or 'Bienenkonig' make up very enjoyable moments throughout the movie.

619922,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00005JMJD,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","The film Sylvia deals with the second half of poet Sylvia Plath's life, primarily on her marriage and motherhood and final great creative efforts. It is a tragic tale. It is tragic for within the wonderful creative person is growing depression, anxiety, and suspicion.  The film reminds us that the human condition is fragile despite the strength and brilliance of creativity and genius. Of course there has been much back and forth around who was right and who was wrong in the Ted Hughes-Sylvia Plath marriage. I must say that the film is extremely fair and even-handed, never fully taking the part of Hughes over Plath or Plath over Hughes.It is extremely difficult to make an interesting movie about a depressed creative genius and at least this film attempts to explore the untreated clinical depression that plagued Plath and made her life miserable and drove her husband away.  What a complete tragedy that the artist found that the very quality within her that was making her miserable also drove away the person she loved most and thus even made her more miserable.  Is there any character in mythology who found that the more they approached the beloved, the more the very act of approach drove the beloved away?  This was the dilemma that Plath faced.I was also touched by the struggle that Plath underwent being pulled into the world of the living by her children, her guilt about leaving them motherless, and yet the depressed undercurrent continually pulling her into the land of the dead.  There is a scene of almost unspeakable pain where Plath puts her children in a car and drives to the ocean where she plans to drown herself. She looks back at the car before walking into the rough surf and sees the tiny innocent eyes of her children watching her every move.  She just could not kill herself at that point and reluctantly and defeated she returns to the world of the living.Yet there is a flaw in the film that is difficult to address. For basically we see a terrible tragedy of a depressed woman lose her husband through jealousy and insecurity and then finally commit suicide and yet we only get a few glimpses of her brilliance. What a struggle her life must have been and yet there were periods of great creativity as evidenced by her life's workGwyneth Paltrow does a great job and is perfectly matched by Daniel Craig as Ted Hughes.

Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent as Plath, as she shows the poet's emotional transformation from just before her marriage, when she was hopeful, to the desolation leading to her suicide.  The movie focuses almost exclusively on the relationship between Plath and poet Ted Hughes (Daniel Craig), and in this, does an admirable job of showing how Plath could not escape the shadow of her husband's fame despite her own ambitions.  His infidelity and her incessant jealousy destroy their marriage while leading to some of Plath's best poetry, the volume titled Ariel that posthumously vaulted Plath to the status she had craved her entire adult life.The acting is generally excellent, with Blythe Danner and Michael Gambon turning in skilled supporting performances. Unfortunately, this biopic lacks balance.  In its relentless push toward Plath's suicide, it forgets that Plath's life was not only about her death.  Her relationship with her children is only faintly hinted at and then usually bleakly; one scene shows her contemplating suicide at the edge of the ocean while the somber face of her daughter, peering out of the car window, pulls her back.  But where is Plath's motherly dedication prior to that?  And while the screenplay portrays Plath's temporary passion for her work after Hughes leaves her, the film leaves little sense of her poetic nature.""Sylvia"" is a good, but not great, film.  Those who know a lot about Plath may be bothered by the omissions, but this is a moving, often compelling, introduction to Plath the woman.

Ted Hughes was played by Daniel Craig, the love interest of Angelina Jolie's ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"", but yet again if you compared the two you would see no physical or even spoken similarities.

619929,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B00005JMJD,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 2]","The ambience created by Christine Jeffs in her 2003 film ""Sylvia"" starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Daniel Craig as married poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes uncomfortably cocoons the viewer within the darker recesses of the creative process gone wrong.  Through the use of shadowy lighting and stark locales, she invites the audience into a world where the feel of artistic angst associated with the uncertainty of breaking with the mainstream flow of life can become a tangible and destructive force.  Here, the paradox of finding the necessary solitude required to devote to one's art becomes equated with a paranoid sense of alienation that defeats all purposes.  With this in mind, realize from the get-go that ""Sylvia"" is not a happy film, but a biopic filled with the frustration of wasted life.The soundtrack by Gabriel Yared emphasizes the film's overwhelming melancholy and dire, already known, outcome to the extreme; as the music uncomfortably meanders and soars, taking on a life of its own, it sets up the fatalistic mood so well that this reviewer and anyone else who isn't familiar with Plath's eventual suicide will indeed wince each time the tragedy motif begins to play. So effectively does it signal the quickening momentum of the pain to come for this member of the Dead Poet's Society.After graduating from Smith College in 1955 and receiving a Fulbright Scholarship to Cambridge, Plath, eventual author of the novel ""The Bell Jar"" and two collections of poems ""The Colossus and Other Poems"" and ""Ariel Poems by Sylvia Plath,"" meets fellow poet Ted Hughes and falls madly in love.  The two passionately discuss poetry, unabashedly spout Shakespeare, and deliberately move forward into their lives together as married academics.  Nonetheless, despite the romantic rebelliousness of their intellectual pursuits, a bleak unhealthiness invades what could have been an idyllic partnership.We get an inkling of the impending doom as Sylvia confides in Ted of a suicide attempt while in college where she crawled under her house after taking an overdose of sleeping pills. The ""why"" of this is never explored within the content of the film.  Perhaps the expectations of her time force her spirit into a plummeting downward spiral. She is not alone in her pre-feminist 60's dilemma--being comfortable with the itch and angst associated with the artistic voice and yet desiring the conventional track of domestic happiness and contentment does not necessarily align well.Already contemplating death before her meeting with Hughes, Plath suffers from the internal stress of not being quite good enough.  When compared to her husband she considers herself an amateur, immature poet where her inability to craft automatic gifted verse results in an obsessive bout of cake baking and many hours of introspective nothingness. Perhaps, Ted symbolizes some intrinsic struggle with being a member of the `second sex.'  Perhaps Plath as a fledgling poetess wanting to compete with her male counterparts succeeds only over time as she cultivates a rage and anger sufficient enough to measure with words. Maybe her real world accountability where the day-to-day moments of juggling teaching and raising children while managing her inner desires simply becomes too meaningless. Enjoying herself and life ventures into territory that is unknown when compared to the more complex desires of expressing a self she could not fully define.Jeffs suggests all these images of Plath's shadow universe with dimly lit interiors, moody music and infinitely nuanced moments where Paltrow as Plath measures herself against Hughes in terms of her worthiness in different venues and social engagements with a wary arch of her neck and an angry pair of pressed-together lips.Paltrow shines with the translucent insouciance of someone with great promise that is unaware of her possibilities.  As the character sinks into depression, Paltrow becomes more ethereal, a creature like Shakespeare's Ariel of whom Plath writes. Paltrow's maternal-automaton portrayal of Plath's last act of putting bread and milk out as breakfast for her children before she kills herself, as well as the slow motion blurring of the film death and discovery-of-the-body sequence suggests an ultimate `poetry in motion' that screams of Plath's defiance for that last tumultuous line of verse fleshing out a situation of which only she could irreparably control like no pen and ink poem ever could.  Clearly Hughes and his children were forever scarred.John Brownlow's screenplay focuses on Hughes' infidelity with Assia Wevill (who became Hughes second wife and ironically also committed suicide) and Plath's almost paranoid concern that Hughes' popularity as a poet and an attractive man with a ""come-hither"" accent made him a magnet for women of all shapes and sizes.  But as Plath already struggled with her self-worth or the seemingly meaninglessness of the world, the trigger of Hughes' popularity and subsequent flirtations seems only a surface diagnosis to the real problem at hand which is never really explored within the film.Why Plath felt the way she did will never be fully understood.  Her repeated attempts at suicide as depicted in her novel ""The Bell Jar"" are not touched upon in this film.  Perhaps flashbacks depicting her life as a child with her parents, her mental state during her guest editorship at Mademoiselle magazine, her overdose of pills and her commitment to a mental facility prior to meeting Hughes would have rounded out her story and not put the sole blame of her melancholy on Hughes, his celebrity, his philandering and her dissatisfaction with her marital life.As there is a lot of emotional ground to cover in the two hour running time of this film, much emphasis is placed on the dysfunctional relationship between Hughes and Plath.  Nonetheless as this is a story about literary figures, it seems strange that the only time either of the pair waxes poetic in the film is to recite some other poet's work.  The audience gets to hear some of ""Daddy,"" but otherwise hears nothing of the works of either Plath or Hughes.  On that purely literary level, hearing some of Hughes ""Birthday Letters: Poems"" verse or Plath's posthumous ""Ariel"" would have placed the audience in their mindspace where from individual perspectives would have come better understanding of the whole angst-ridden tale.Bottom line?  ""Sylvia,"" directed by Christine Jeffs, deals with a somber theme that is sure to depress even lovers of the poetry of Sylvia Plath and poet Laureate Ted Hughes.  Melancholy music and dimly lit spaces create an ambiance of overwhelmingly ill-fated disaster that portrays the dark side of genius in an extreme albeit ethereal way that suggests rather than defines Plath's ultimate motive.  The dialogue of the film severely lacks recitation of either of the poets' works but good performances by Gwyneth Paltrow, Daniel Craig and Blythe Danner convince the audience to remain seated until the film's bleak climax.  Recommended only to those who want to wallow inside Plath's complex mindset.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",3,The Society of Dead Poets,1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,7121,"['ambience',

I don't pretend to be a very understanding person when it comes to poetry. However, it seemed to me that Ted and Sylvia Hughes didn't know how to present the communicated word to each other in thier marriage. There were 2 rather good performances in here with Gwynnth Paltrow as Sylvia, and Daniel Cage as Ted. Thrusted together by thier love of poetry, and cut down by the real world of ""Hey you 2 are married; be a team, and not two separate players."" I feel that's what had happened. The marriage seemed rather good in the beginning, and you could see that as inspiration ran on both Ted and Sylvia, but the realization of being a family instead of a couple just didn't sit too well, and Sylvia went on a trip to post partum depression, and Ted went on a trip to drive Sylvia what seemed to be crazy. With Sylvia's depression running rampant he should've been trying to help her, and not going off to tend to business. Sylvia's welfare should've been his business. However, Sylvia's behavior seemed to just falter more and more as she'd suspect Ted cheating on her, and finally he does so with another female poet. The last few moments of this movie focused on the possibility that Ted and Sylvia getting back together, and this is what Sylvia is hoping, but Ted says that the other woman is pregnant, and he can't leave her. This finally pushes Sylvia over the edge, and she commits suicide on Feb. 11, 1963. She was very young, and to me she died way too early. She had more to offer the world, but when depression kicks into high gear the only thing you can think of is death. I know that's how it was with my late wife I did, or so I thought everything I knew how to to keep my wife happy, but in the end it still wasn't enough. She wanted to die, and she died in a hot parking lot on June 11, 2003. This movie was, or so I thought rather slow moving, and at many times not an upbeat movie.

As someone who writes herself, I have long admired the mesmerizing, exposed, raw depth that is Sylvia's talent. Sylvia's poems (and life), move the on looker deep inside of her core in such a way that no other can do. This was not captured in the movie. This movie was a surface display that skims the honesty and history of Sylvia. It's as if the director was provided a &quot;summary&quot; of Sylvia's life (and only part of her life, her life with Ted) and stretched that summary out for an hour and fifty minutes. The movie was slow and this could have been avoided if more of her life was explored. To see the essence of Sylvia, you need to see her earlier years (her childhood, her father and mother, her hospital stay, her internship, The Bell Jar) and delve inside of her mind and her need to purge through her writings. There was also an evolution in the development of Sylvia's poems, in her real life, that the movie completely by passed. Her poems initially were written with the aide of a thesaurus and tended to be classic and calculated, while the final poems, written before her death came pouring out in shorter, smashing truth. Her best poems written at her deepest point. There is a creative story to be told her then, as well. Her poems growth, tell multiple stories in themselves. I learned nothing new, and in fact mostly noticed what was missing. The movie was emotional, but too direct as to why (there was more to the why). Any movie that has such an ending, would touch the viewer. However, it was actually my prior knowledge of Sylvias demise that moved me through the movie, not the movie itself.

Sylvia Plath is a poet who come into her own after her famous suicide - an act that was a reflection of her troubled life and failed previous childhood suicide attempt. Now her novel &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; and her most famous collection of poems &quot;Ariel&quot; have earned her a seat in the high echelon of American poets.  Would she have achieved that status were it not for her life as wife of the enigmatic poet Ted Hughes, with all the highs and lows that marriage afforded is a question that will never be answered.  But at least in SYLVIA we have a beautifully and lovingly rendered version of what happens in the poet's mind as directed by Christine Jeffs.The entire cast is well selected and the performances are subtle, quality ones.  Gweneth Paltrow captures the fragility and paranoia/depression mind state of Plath as well as any actress could.  Her mother in the film is played to perfection by Blythe Danner, Paltrow's real life mother.  Ted Hughes is portrayed by Daniel Craig who manages to maintain our empathy despite the acts that on screen are seen as contributory to Plath's demise.  Those acts just happen to likewise have contributed to the content and flavor and message of her poems.The cinematography is wondrous, illuminating not only the exteriors of London and Devon, England, but also exploring the interiors of the dark places Sylvia and Ted had lived. These dark places are wonderful metaphors for the spaces within the mind that comes unwound.  Yes, there may be other versions of Plath's life, especially now that Ted Hughes &quot;Birthday Letters&quot; were published recently just before Hughes dies.

What this movie does so well is make the downward spiraling of Plath interesting without stooping to cheap sentiment or sensationalism. Much of the credit for this film's success must go to Gwyneth Paltrow who is quite mesmerizing as the tragic poet. She literally becomes Sylvia Plath. Conventional wisdom is that Ted Hughes, played here by Daniel Craig, was basically a cad and treated Plath badly. That may in fact be true, but this film portays him as someone who for a long time worked hard to save a relationship that was doomed from the beginning. In her increasing paranoia, Plath accused him of having affairs with almost everyone he met, practically driving him into the arms of other women-- at least according to this film version.Certainly these two extremely talented poets join the ranks of other famous couples who though passionately in love cannot live together.

The movie begins when Sylvia is studying in Britain on a scholarship.  In the beginning, we watch as Sylvia Plath encounters harsh reviews of her writing and then the man whom would play a huge role in her demise, famed British poet Ted Hughes.  The rest of the movie depicts the married life of Ted and Sylvia, which I think would have been a more appropriate title for this movie.  Gwyneth Paltrow does a fantastic job of portraying the volatile emotions of Sylvia Plath.  On one hand loving her man with a burning intensity not very often displayed by women.  On the other hand, she is extremely jealous and has outbursts when she feels unloved or disrespected by Ted.  Finally, we see the demise of Sylvia when Ted leaves her, and how she struggles with inner demons in the last days of her life, culminating in her suicide.I don't agree with a previous reviewer that this movie is only meant for Plath fans.  There is fantastic acting and quite a bit of depth to each of the characters.

619939,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00005JMJD,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[84, 89]","Director Christine Jeffs manages to strike an evenhanded tone in her biopic &quot;Sylvia,&quot; which deals with the last few years in the life of poet Sylvia Plath. Jeffs doesn't place all the blame for Ms. Plath's suffering, deep depression and subsequent suicide on Ted Hughes, (which many Plath fans do), nor does she glorify the poet's pain. However, the complexities of Plath's psyche, illness, motivations and goals, the intricacies of her relationship and marriage to Hughes, and her roles as mother and poet, are short shrifted. I don't know if this flaw is due to the limitations of the medium or to problems with the screenwriting and direction. This is a film about a woman with a suicidal past who writes poetry, loves, marries, becomes depressed, insecure and jealous, has children, is &quot;deceived,&quot; falls deeper into depression and turns on the gas - the main character just happens to be Sylvia Plath. I really would have liked to have seen more of an emphasis given to Plath's writing and love of literature. Ms. Plath also placed tremendous importance on parenting her children and often found much pleasure in being a mother and a wife, as well as a poet. This is not evident in the movie.Sylvia Plath's story is a desperate and tragic one. However, the movie dwells on her depression to the extent that it appears the writer never had a happy moment after her honeymoon. Even the film's use of color reflects this unhappy mood. Plath dresses in warm colors up until her wedding, after which her clothes and the ambient colors become darker and darker. Her writer's block is clearly shown but her periods of extreme productivity, especially toward the end of her life, when, writing through the nights she poured poetry onto the page with almost manic energy, are not really portrayed. All the biographies I have read on Sylvia Plath discuss the joy she found in motherhood. Her exhaustion caring for two small children, taking care of her home and writing is evident throughout the movie, as it was in real life. But nowhere is Ms. Plath shown laughing and playing with her children, with the exception of a brief Christmas scene. Her small daughter is almost always shown toddling behind her mother, a bewildered, sad expression on her face. Nor does the movie show Ms. Plath's tremendous struggle to live, fighting against her overwhelming depression. The contrasts between happiness and deep sorrow, energy and listlessness, struggle for control over her demons and loss of control are strangely absent. The character of Sylvia Plath ultimately comes across as a relatively passive figure, at the mercy of her mental illness, whose moods are closely tied to her husband's demonstrations of affection and attention.Gwyneth Paltrow does a wonderful job, as always, given the material she had to work with. Her performance is sensitive and intense. The few times she recites poetry, including a wonderful scene where she does a small bit from Chaucer's &quot;Wife of Bath&quot; in Middle English, are extraordinary. Daniel Craig as Ted Hughes is excellent, capturing the magnetic charisma of the poet, his bewilderment as his relationship falls apart, and his careless indifference toward Sylvia's suffering and his children's vulnerability. Blythe Danner, Paltrow's mother in real life, is excellent in the role of Plath's mother and Michael Gambon does an extraordinary job as the sympathetic downstairs neighbor.I have been a big fan of Sylvia Plath's poetry for many years and have read some excellent biographies on the poet as well as work by Ted Hughes. This is a difficult review for me to write because I want to be objective about the film, which does oversimplify Ms. Plath's life. We get the facts but not the depth. There is a tremendous lack of scope here. If one is not familiar with Plath and her work I am not sure that the movie would inform with more than a melodramatic overview of her life. As stated above, the acting is fine and the photography appropriately moody. For a more comprehensive experience I would suggest reading some of Ms. Plath's exceptional poetry, if you haven't already, before viewing the film.JANA",3,Excellent Performances But &quot;Sylvia&quot; Lacks Depth.,1080345600,"03 27, 2004",2004,4169,"['Director', 'Christine', 'Jeffs', 'strike', 'evenhanded', 'tone', 'biopic', 'quot', 'Sylvia', 'quot', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'life', 'poet', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'Jeffs', ""n't"", 'place', 'blame', 'Ms.', 'Plath', 'suffering', 'deep', 'depression', 'subsequent', 'suicide', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'many', 'Plath', 'fans', 'do', 'glorify', 'poet', 'pain', 'However', 'complexities', 'Plath', 'psyche', 'illness', 'motivations', 'goals', 'intricacies', 'relationship', 'marriage', 'Hughes', 'roles', 'mother', 'poet', 'are', 'short', 'shrifted', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'flaw', 'due', 'limitations', 'medium', 'problems', 'screenwriting', 'direction', 'film', 'woman', 'suicidal', 'past', 'who', 'poetry', 'marries', 'becomes', 'depressed', 'insecure', 'jealous', 'children', 'quot', 'deceived', 'quot', 'deeper', 'depression', 'gas', 'main', 'character', 'just', 'be', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'emphasis', 'given', 'Plath', 'writing', 'love', 'literature', 'Ms.', 'Plath', 'also', 'placed', 'tremendous', 'importance', 'parenting', 'children', 'often', 'found', 'much', 'pleasure', 'being', 'mother', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'poet', 'not', 'evident', 'movie.Sylvia', 'Plath', 'story', 'desperate', 'tragic', 'one', 'However', 'movie', 'depression', 'extent', 'writer', 'never', 'had', 'happy', 'moment', 'honeymoon', 'Even', 'film', 'use', 'color', 'unhappy', 'mood', 'Plath', 'dresses', 'warm', 'colors', 'up', 'wedding', 'clothes', 'ambient', 'colors', 'become', 'darker', 'darker', 'writer', 'block', 'clearly', 'shown', 'periods', 'extreme', 'productivity', 'especially', 'end', 'life', 'when', 'writing', 'nights', 'poured', 'poetry', 'page', 'almost', 'manic', 'energy', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'portrayed', 'biographies', 'have', 'read', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'joy', 'found', 'motherhood', 'exhaustion', 'caring', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'taking', 'care', 'home', 'writing', 'evident', 'movie', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'nowhere', 'Ms.', 'Plath', 'shown', 'laughing', 'playing', 'children', 'exception', 'brief', 'Christmas', 'scene', 'small', 'daughter', 'almost', 'always', 'shown', 'toddling', 'mother', 'bewildered', 'sad', 'expression', 'face', 'movie', 'show', 'Ms.', 'Plath', 'tremendous', 'struggle', 'live', 'fighting', 'overwhelming', 'depression', 'contrasts', 'happiness', 'deep', 'sorrow', 'energy', 'listlessness', 'struggle', 'control', 'demons', 'loss', 'control', 'are', 'strangely', 'absent', 'character', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'ultimately', 'across', 'relatively', 'passive', 'figure', 'mercy', 'mental', 'illness', 'moods', 'are', 'closely', 'tied', 'husband', 'demonstrations', 'affection', 'attention.Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'wonderful', 'job', 'always', 'given', 'material', 'had', 'work', 'performance', 'sensitive', 'intense', 'few', 'times', 'poetry', 'including', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'where', 'small', 'bit', 'Chaucer', 'quot', 'Wife', 'Bath', 'quot', 'Middle', 'English', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'excellent', 'capturing', 'magnetic', 'charisma', 'poet', 'bewilderment', 'relationship', 'apart', 'careless', 'indifference', 'Sylvia', 'suffering', 'children', 'vulnerability', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'Paltrow', 'mother', 'real', 'life', 'excellent', 'role', 'Plath', 'mother', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'extraordinary', 'job', 'sympathetic', 'downstairs', 'neighbor.I', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'poetry', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'read', 'excellent', 'biographies', 'poet', 'as', 'well', 'work', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'difficult', 'review', 'write', 'want', 'be', 'objective', 'film', 'oversimplify', 'Ms.', 'Plath', 'life', 'get', 'facts', 'not', 'depth', 'tremendous', 'lack', 'scope', 'here', 'one', 'not', 'familiar', 'Plath', 'work', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'would', 'inform', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'overview', 'life', 'stated', 'acting', 'fine', 'photography', 'appropriately', 'moody', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'experience', 'would', 'suggest', 'reading', 'Ms.', 'Plath', 'exceptional', 'poetry', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'viewing', 'film.JANA']",Sylvia

619942,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00005JMJD,J from NY,"[3, 3]","""Sylvia"" does a solid job of communicating the tragedy of Plath's life to devoted readers and the average viewer alike: Gwyneth Paltrow gives a notable performance as the disturbed, intense, and tragically flawed poetess who, with only two collections of verse, changed the face of modern poetry and never lived to bask in the fruits of her own greatness.Since Plath's suicide a lot of baseless assumptions have been made from her work and certain aspects of her tumultuous, but very accomplished, life: the most absurd of which is that husband and poet Ted Hughes was somehow responsible for her self-immolation.  If only it were that simple.As shown very candidly in this film, Sylvia Plath was a woman with the ambition of a Caesar and the ego of Alexander the Great.  The unrelenting pressure she put on herself to produce poetry (without which we might not have ""Daddy"", ""Ariel""?) may have accelerated whatever imbalance she had to begin with.  Before she even met Hughes a serious suicide attempt had been made.  Her intensity was painful and frightening.Not that the marriage helped--Hughes was a womanizing alcoholic who was more than willing to set aside ethical qualms to satisfy his slightest whims.  In later life this all caught up to him and he developed something of a conscience, but by then it was far too late and he had left two dead women and one murdered child in his wake.This movie gets very dark very fast, as you might expect.  At the beginning, though, we are treated to a realistic and vivid portrayal of two great poets meeting one another in the heat of the muse's grip: reciting poetry with the speed of a computer, obsessing over every second that passes without a word written, and flinging verses at each other, some of them medieval and archaic.Another reviewer said there ""wasn't much of the writing"" in the film.  I'd have to disagree.  While Hughes poems and Plath's poems aren't given exclusive attention, we hear Chaucer, Yeats, Lowell, and hosts of other poets referenced and quoted continually.Even with the contagious romanticism of the film and of the poet's lives,Plath and figures like her (Anne Sexton, Virginia Woolf, and similar male poets) have left some very dangerous and negative stereotypes as a result of their self-destruction.  Decadence is miserable and not creative in the slightest.  Poetry is particularly prone to this myth.  After the movie I wondered: what if Plath had thought about her poetry before she stuck her head in that oven?  Or her children?  Imagine what poetry we would have today.  All that aside, this is definitely a worthwhile film for anyone interested in the life of a real poet.",4,Intense film about an intense figure,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,2661,"['Sylvia', 'solid', 'job', 'communicating', 'tragedy', 'Plath', 'life', 'devoted', 'readers', 'average', 'viewer', 'alike', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'notable', 'performance', 'disturbed', 'intense', 'tragically', 'flawed', 'poetess', 'who', 'only', 'two', 'collections', 'verse', 'changed', 'face', 'modern', 'poetry', 'never', 'lived', 'bask', 'fruits', 'own', 'greatness.Since', 'Plath', 'suicide', 'lot', 'baseless', 'assumptions', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'work', 'certain', 'aspects', 'tumultuous', 'very', 'accomplished', 'life', 'most', 'absurd', 'husband', 'poet', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'was', 'somehow', 'responsible', 'self-immolation', 'only', 'were', 'simple.As', 'shown', 'very', 'candidly', 'film', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'was', 'woman', 'ambition', 'Caesar', 'ego', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'unrelenting', 'pressure', 'put', 'produce', 'poetry', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'Daddy', 'Ariel', 'may', 'have', 'accelerated', 'imbalance', 'had', 'begin', 'even', 'met', 'Hughes', 'serious', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'intensity', 'was', 'painful', 'marriage', 'helped', 'Hughes', 'was', 'womanizing', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'willing', 'set', 'aside', 'ethical', 'qualms', 'satisfy', 'slightest', 'whims', 'later', 'life', 'caught', 'up', 'developed', 'something', 'conscience', 'then', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'had', 'left', 'two', 'dead', 'women', 'one', 'murdered', 'child', 'wake.This', 'movie', 'very', 'dark', 'very', 'fast', 'might', 'expect', 'beginning', 'though', 'are', 'treated', 'realistic', 'vivid', 'portrayal', 'two', 'great', 'poets', 'meeting', 'one', 'heat', 'muse', 'grip', 'reciting', 'poetry', 'speed', 'computer', 'obsessing', 'over', 'second', 'word', 'written', 'flinging', 'verses', 'other', 'medieval', 'archaic.Another', 'reviewer', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'writing', 'film', ""'d"", 'have', 'disagree', 'Hughes', 'poems', 'Plath', 'poems', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'exclusive', 'attention', 'hear', 'Chaucer', 'Yeats', 'Lowell', 'hosts', 'other', 'poets', 'referenced', 'quoted', 'continually.Even', 'contagious', 'romanticism', 'film', 'poet', 'lives', 'Plath', 'figures', 'Anne', 'Sexton', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'similar', 'male', 'poets', 'have', 'left', 'very', 'dangerous', 'negative', 'stereotypes', 'result', 'self-destruction', 'Decadence', 'miserable', 'not', 'creative', 'slightest', 'Poetry', 'particularly', 'prone', 'myth', 'movie', 'wondered', 'what', 'Plath', 'had', 'thought', 'poetry', 'stuck', 'head', 'oven', 'children', 'Imagine', 'what', 'poetry', 'would', 'have', 'today', 'aside', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'anyone', 'interested', 'life', 'real', 'poet']",Sylvia
619943,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JMJD,Joe Sherry,"[4, 6]","A film by Christine Jeffs""Sylvia"" is a film about the life of the American poet Sylvia Plath (Gwyneth Paltrow).  The film begins with Plath in college and being all upset about the review of her poetry in a magazine (it might have been a university magazine, but that is never made clear).  Soon after she is told about another young poet named Ted Hughes (Daniel Craig).  They meet and fall in lust, and despite the title of the movie being ""Sylvia"" the movie quickly becomes about Sylvia and Ted.  Perhaps this is my greatest problem with ""Sylvia"", that we don't see Sylvia Plath as her own woman.  Instead we see Sylvia Plath only in relation to Ted Hughes.  I do not know too much about the life of Plath, but since her journals were posthumously published, and she is the author of ""The Bell Jar"", ""Ariel"" and won the Pulitzer Prize (also posthumously) for her collected poetry, surely she was a strong enough personality to actually be the subject of a movie which is supposedly about her.  But, perhaps I'm wrong about that.This is a depressing movie.  Sylvia Plath was fairly depressive in her own life, and ""Sylvia"" gets this right.  She is manic and unstable and emotionally beat down by Ted Hughes.  Her marriage of ups and downs is mostly downs and apparently she is never able to find her focus in writing, though she does manage to publish a couple of books of poetry.  She is still overshadowed by her more successful husband.  At this point, I think ""I"" want to stick my head in an oven.  It feels like Plath gets yanked around from place to place and is her own emotional rollercoaster and gets no emotional support from her husband who ends up cheating on her anyway.We never really get to see Sylvia writing her poetry, or speaking her poetry, or using any of her intellectual talents other than in one early scene which sets up the lust between Plath and Hughes.  The reason for this is probably because Sylvia Plath's daughter would not permit the filmmakers to use any of her mother's poetry, which meant that only whatever could be legally used outside of that permission was used.  This left us with only a couple of brief lines of poetry from a very famous poet.  This unquestionably harms the movie because we have no sense in why Plath is famous and remembered.  All we have is what we see and hear in the movie and that is a depressed poet who doesn't write is having an unhappy life.  Let me see ""that"" movie!The problem is not the casting.  Gwyneth Paltrow does an excellent job in portraying Sylvia Plath and she even looks remarkably like the pictures I have seen of Sylvia Plath.  Daniel Craig does a fine job of Ted Hughes, though I have no sense of comparison.  The problem is that this is a very dreary movie and it gives us no reason to care for these characters, especially the heroine.  ""Sylvia"" is dull, it is boring.  This was a good role for Gwyneth Paltrow to play, but she would have been better served in a different movie about Sylvia Plath.

619944,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00005JMJD,Josh Hitchens,"[23, 24]","When Frieda Hughes wrote a poem in protest of this film, she called it ""Sylvia Suicide Doll."" It turns out that she wasn't that far off. This is a mediocre movie in many respects, and a decent one in others. Overall, it is a misfire.Sylvia Plath (Gwyneth Paltrow) was an American poet who found her soul mate in British poet Ted Hughes, played here by Daniel Craig. Sylvia was obsessed with her poetry, and was a little resentful when her husband's star eclipsed hers. Their passionate marriage deteriorates when Hughes cheats on Sylvia and she discovers it, moving with her two children to London. Worn down by depression, Sylvia Plath killed herself in 1963, at the age of thirty, but not before writing the brilliant ""Ariel"" poems, which secured her place in the canon of American poets.Gwyneth Paltrow's performance as Sylvia Plath is the reason to see this movie. She is especially effective in the second part of the film, when Sylvia separates from Ted Hughes and plunges into a deep depression. In these scenes Paltrow looks and acts so much like the real Plath that you get goose bumps. The resemblence is eerie. Paltrow creates a woman desperate for love and recognition, but who dealt with intense suicidal urges all her life. Many people have decided to cast Sylvia Plath as a saint, with Hughes as the devil who drove her to suicide. Paltrow makes it clear that Sylvia's death wish was there from the beginning, and dares to make Plath unlikeable at times. You can understand why Ted Hughes left her, but also sympathize with her as she falls apart. The scene where Sylvia burns the letters that Ted's mistress wrote him makes your heart break. Gwyneth Paltrow gives a very strong, brave performance. It's a tragedy that nearly everything surrounding it is inferior.The supporting cast, with the exception of Michael Gambon and Blythe Danner, is forgettable. Daniel Craig is hopeless as Ted Hughes, he is simply not a very good actor. The first choices for the part of Ted were Russell Crowe and Colin Firth, who both refused, no doubt because the script for ""Sylvia"" is weak. It fails to give you a sense of who Plath was as a writer, and is full of holes. In one scene, Sylvia says that she can't write anymore. In the very next, she is celebrating the publication of ""The Colossus,"" her first book. The cinematography for this movie is breathtakingly beautiful, one of the best of the year.The one thing that I cannot forgive this movie for is its ending. It perpetuates the myth that Sylvia Plath is a martyr to suicide, that it is somehow noble that she abandones her two young children and her career. In the film, as Sylvia looks into the oven, a heavenly golden light shines upon her. There is no excuse for this ending. Sylvia Plath's suicide was a tragic loss to her family and to literature, not a noble act.See this movie for the cinematography and for Gwyneth Paltrow's great performance. One day there will be a great movie made about the life of Sylvia Plath.

Yes. It would be the perfect study for a poet, writer, mother, one-time-depressed-person-who-doesn't-kill-herself like me.I also knew Gwyneth Paltrow was in it so it must have merit from that alone.I read several of the reviews here and was prepared for anything - not liking it, loving it, not caring about it.I found myself pulled into the imagery from the beginning - ironically, to the aliveness which seemed to inform Sylvia's creativity... like the energy of the wind pushing their leaves into dancing or the movement of the row boat upon the ocean when she was ""unable to write"".One of the reviewers spoke of this piece being presented from the viewpoint of Plath's husband, poet Ted Hughes, played in this film by Daniel Craig..  I felt it was balanced - and truthful - it didn't sugar-coat either ""side"", it instead simply unfolded the story that bound these two (and those around them) forever.Some of my favorite images from the film were Ted leaving, once again, and the focus being strongly on the couple and then seeing their daughter, alone, playing quietly outside as her Daddy leaves them.  It is like the child is a shadowy afterthought, perhaps like Plath saw herself following her Father's death when she was only 9 years old.Another image is Plath preparing to write (typewriter in place, paper and pencils at attention, everything ""perfect"") and nothing coming from her mind or heart onto the page.I also appreciated seeing Plath's intuitive side picking up on her husband's ultimate marriage breaking affair during a seemingly innocent incident, which was followed by an incredible line (and I wonder if it came from any of Plath's writing?"") ""The truth comes to me. The truth loves me.""I also appreciated the subtlety of Plath's ever-present mental illness. Throughout the movie there were times when she would simply repeat, ""I am tired. I am sooooo tired.""She wears the same skirt in many of the scenes, day after month after year.I also tuned into the quietness of Plath's depression - the wordlessness of it - the inability to speak it or write it into the air.  She finally speaks it to a friend, saying ""I'm hollow.""Yes, there is much to consider, to study, to revel in from this movie.  The facial expressions from Paltrow and Craig are enough to fill several pages.Watch it. Sit with it. Watch it. Sit with it.

619947,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B00005JMJD,K. Boullosa,"[5, 6]","In her effort to avoid blaming the much-maligned Ted Hughes for Sylvia Plath's 1963 suicide, the director of ""Sylvia"" reduces the period covering Plath's graduate studies at Cambridge University, her marriage to Hughes, the birth of their two children, and Plath's descent into morbid depression and suicide, to a series of rapid brushstrokes.  These brushstrokes, unfortunately, are too shallow to convey the complexity of Plath's relationship with Hughes, let alone her relationship with the emotional demons that had haunted Plath since puberty.  The problem is, this shallowness not only doesn't tell the whole truth, it alters it.Absent from the film is Sylvia's tortured psychological relationship with the father she lost at the age of eight; her equally complex relationship with her emotionally repressed mother is barely referenced (the scene in which the beautiful Blythe Danner, as Sylvia' mother, tells Hughes that Sylvia loves him because he's the only man she's ever been afraid of, as all other men have been afraid of her, is totally out of character given even a passing knowledge of Aurelia Plath); Sylvia's unrealistic yearnings toward men and marriage as expressed through her dogged search for the perfect Uber-Mate who was part Great Hunter/part Great Poet; Hughes's complex relationship with his sister, Olwyn, with whom Plath felt intensely competitive; Hughes's propensity to occasional violence; and, lastly, Hughes's willingness to allow Plath's more overt ambition to serve his work as well, while he posed as the purer spirit who didn't care whether his work was published or not.  It is a great irony that Hughes went on to become Poet Laureate of England, because Plath devoted herself as much to circulating his work as hers in the early years of their marriage, in a way that he either was not willing or organized enough to do.  It is doubtful that Hughes would have gotten as well known as he did, as early as he did, without her efforts.  Sylvia, in her unabashed ambition, was as quintessentially American as Hughes was quintessentially English in his public demurral of ambition.  Because of her ambition, her obvious desire to marry Hughes, and the intense emotional persona that many had observed, Hughes's friends were stunned at his choice.  This reviewer has always suspected that Hughes found Plath so attractive because her ambition served as a shield behind which he could hide his own.The bottom line is that neither of these two intense, gifted, and unusual people was a bed of roses to live with.  Yet we see in the film only that Sylvia is riddled with suspicion about her husband's fidelity, that she suffered from some writer's block at one point that caused her to be jealous of his steady output, and that suddenly her fears re his infidelity materialized.  The film doesn't make clear which came first: her increasingly bizarre behavior, or his increasing loss of interest in the marriage and in sustaining an emotionally unstable partner.  In an extraordinarily bitchy memoir, Dido Merwin, who got to know the couple when they moved permanently to England, places the blame for Hughes's defection from the marriage with Asia Wevill squarely on Plath's suspicions, which Merwin clearly felt drove Hughes to shrug his shoulders and act on those suspicions - a monstrously oversimplified view that absolves Hughes of any responsibility for how he handled the mounting tensions in his marriage.In addition to searching for the Uber-Mate, Plath was obsessed with being one.  By all accounts she was an attentive mother and an accomplished cook and housewife.  When she wasn't parenting, laundering, cleaning, and cooking, Plath found time to write some more than respectable poetry, her one novel (""The Bell Jar"", published first under the pen name Victoria Lucas), and keep her own work and that of her husband's (she retyped all his manuscripts) in constant circulation.  And, while Hughes's adoration of their first child, Frieda, is included in the film, his peculiar resentment and emotional distance from their second child, Nick, is not.By the time the Hughes's moved to the countryside in Devon, Plath had gone from a striking and vibrant, if troubled blonde, to a dowdy, harried mother with long brown braids, trying to keep bees, grow flowers and vegetables, run a large house with few modern conveniences, care for two small children, and, in the few hours before dawn she could call her own, write.  The house was nearly impossible to heat - in winter the indoor temperature settled in the mid-40 degrees and Plath was constantly sick.The film does not illustrate Plath's lifelong penchant for unrealistic idealizations - she plunges eagerly into the idea of English country life without weighing the intellectual consequences of isolation from the cultural stimulation of London and its literary life, or the cost to her writing in time spent running the large, old country house, its kitchen gardens, etc. - much as Plath did not stop to think about the consequences of marrying a stunningly charismatic (ask any woman who heard Hughes read in his prime), gifted, equally complex, husband with a surprisingly old-fashioned view of marriage.  The realities of the move to Devon, in my opinion, dealt a crushing blow to the Hughes marriage, from which it never recovered.Gwyneth Paltrow, bland and fashionably anorexic looking as ever, is woefully miscast as the statuesque, fiery, and deeply disturbed Sylvia. She just doesn't have the candlepower to be plausible as the woman who wrote ""Ariel"".  Daniel Craig, a better and more charismatic actor than Paltrow, does well as far as he's allowed to as Ted Hughes, it's just that he isn't allowed to go too far.  But Craig is also somewhat miscast - with all due respect, despite the dyed dark hair, Craig is fair and on the short side.  Most of the time I am not wedded to exact verisimilitude in these matters.  But those who have read widely about her know that the 5'9"" Plath was nearly obsessed with finding a tall, rugged man as her mate, and that the very tall, dark Hughes seemed tailor-made to her eyes (""And then I saw him, that big, dark, hunky boy, the only one there huge enough for me"" as she excitedly described him in her journal after seeing Hughes for the first time at that fatal party in Cambridge).  To ignore these portions of Plath's psyche is to eliminate crucial pieces of the puzzle of why she chose who she did, and why things turned out the way they did.  Craig is intense and intelligent, and not exactly lacking in erotic appeal, but, nevertheless, he was the wrong actor for this part.  The more you know about these two writers, the less these two actors fit the bill.There are, finally, simply too many unaccounted-for gaps in ""Sylvia"" between what happened and why.  In order to fill in those gaps, Jeffs would have had to make a different, more complex film, one in which Plath and Hughes are each shown as much less sympathetic, but far more dimensional.  All we have here is a rushed cartoon that adds up to the ""Cliff Notes On The Last Years Of Sylvia Plath.""",3,"The Hughes-Plath Marriage, In Shorthand",1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,7109,"['effort',

Try to keep away the fans who have devoured every biography of Plath and every memoir by everyone who knew her even tangentially.  The DVD is pretty shoddy, there are no features where there could have been plenty!  But that might be because apparently the tyrannical Plath Estate refused to let the producers use any of Plath's poetry and denied them cooperation in every other way as well, and young Frieda attacked the film without having seen any of it, but she seems to be rather a touchy person but who could blame her?  Anyhow the film is as flat as an old souffle, Gwyneth looks a lot like Sylvia, Blythe Danner is simply horrible playing Aurelia, and the house she shows off to Ted makes her seem like a millionairess with black servants in a vast mansion, which in no way reflects the true economic status of Aurelia and Otto, you just watch the engagement party sequence with your jaw hanging open, the movie never really recovers from this terrible faux pas.  But outside of that, it's pretty good.  Michael Gambon is in it, reminding us of why ""Gambon"" is the French word for HAM.The two young actors who play David and Assia Wevill are also perfectly cast.

619950,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00005JMJD,Larry VanDeSande,"[3, 5]","Gwyneth Paltrow is at her most powerful and persuasive in this portrayal of troubled American poet and author Sylvia Plath. The principal actor in this drama -- who appears in every scene -- gives a subtle, textured and three dimensional portrait of the young wife, mother and author of poetry about death, despair and foreboding. Her work parallels her life in the drama.All the players in this biopic turn in fine work including Daniel Craig as Ted Hughes, the noted poet and Plath's husband who loved his wife and children, yet typically found answers to family conflict at the bottom of a liquor bottle or in another woman's bed. Other players -- including a sympathetic neighbor and Paltrow's real life mother, Blythe Danner, who played her mother in the movie -- turn in equally believable work.Director Christine Jeffs deserves credit for the uniformly outstanding work by the actors. Each fills a niche in this somewhat naive and transparent look at a famous person's life, and each does fine work in their own right, supporting the best work of Paltrow's career.This film is less electric and less kaleidoscopic than another depressing life story, ""Hilary and Jackie"", that covers much of the same ground.

619951,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMJD,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","There was a point early on when I was struck by the thought of the degree to which the 2003 film &quot;Sylvia&quot; is burdened with our knowledge that in the end Sylvia Plath is going to stick her head in an oven in one of the most famous suicides of the 20th century.  The next thing I know Ted Hughes (Daniel Craig) is telling Sylvia (Gwyneth Paltrow) that to write poetry she just needs to pick a subject &quot;and stick her head in it.&quot;  Ouch.Of course the great irony is that Ted Hughes' infidelity inspired Plath's best work and her suicide made her immortal.  However, I would be inclined to think the admirers of Plath's poetry are going to be disappointed for two major reasons.  First, the screenplay by John Brownlow establishes from the beginning of the film the idea that Plath was a suicide waiting to happen.  A suicide attempt that almost succeeded before she went to college in England becomes the key to everything that happens follows and for those who have blame Hughes for Plath's death there is considerably less support for that idea than they might expect to see.  The precipitous event, if you would put your finger on one thing in the film, ends up being the pregnancy of the woman with whom he was having an affair.  The argument been that Plath killed herself because her husband had left her for another woman (a fellow poet named Assia Wevill, who was also married), but there is a certain ambiguity to the scene where Hughes speaks more of not being able to return.  You can see that in the film if you want to find it, but objectively the film puts most of the responsibility on Plath.  Nor does it point out that Wevill would eventually kill herself and the daughter she had by Hughes, using gas, just as Plath did, which certainly strike you as an additional condemnation as well.Second, and this point applies more to those of us who are not really familiar with the poetry of either Plath or Hughes, the film is pretty much devoid of their work.  Frieda Hughes, Plath's daughter and literary executor, refused to cooperate with the producers of this film, specifically refusing to allow them access to her mother's poetry, and also publicly denounced the film in a published poem of her own: &quot;They think/ I should give them my mother's words/ To fill the mouth of their monster/ Their Sylvia suicide doll.&quot;  Granted, it is difficult to make a film that captures the literary experience of writing, but it is certainly easier if you are dealing with poetry or drama (i.e., &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;) than a novel.  I have to believe that this would have been a powerful film that celebrated Plath's creativity at the same time it depicts her hurtling towards death.Plath's poems were passionate about death and I can well imagine those who have committed some of her poems to memory inserting them at the right points in the film.  Despite solid performances by Paltrow and Craig the end result is that &quot;Slyvia&quot; is an incomplete performance, smacking of voyeurism rather than an attempt at understanding.  This would be akin to watching &quot;Amadeus&quot; without the music of &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot; without the paintings.",4,"The life and death of Slyvia Plath, but without the poetry",1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,3205,"['was', 'point', 'early', 'when', 'was', 'struck', 'thought', 'degree', '2003', 'film', 'quot', 'Sylvia', 'quot', 'burdened', 'knowledge', 'end', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'going', 'stick', 'head', 'oven', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'suicides', '20th', 'century', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'telling', 'Sylvia', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'write', 'poetry', 'just', 'pick', 'subject', 'quot', 'stick', 'head', 'it.', 'quot', 'Ouch.Of', 'course', 'great', 'irony', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'infidelity', 'inspired', 'Plath', 'best', 'work', 'suicide', 'made', 'immortal', 'However', 'would', 'be', 'inclined', 'think', 'admirers', 'Plath', 'poetry', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'two', 'major', 'reasons', 'First', 'screenplay', 'John', 'Brownlow', 'establishes', 'beginning', 'film', 'idea', 'Plath', 'was', 'suicide', 'waiting', 'happen', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'almost', 'succeeded', 'went', 'college', 'England', 'key', 'everything', 'who', 'have', 'blame', 'Hughes', 'Plath', 'death', 'considerably', 'less', 'support', 'idea', 'might', 'expect', 'see', 'precipitous', 'event', 'would', 'put', 'finger', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'pregnancy', 'woman', 'whom', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'argument', 'been', 'Plath', 'killed', 'husband', 'had', 'left', 'woman', 'fellow', 'poet', 'named', 'Assia', 'Wevill', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'married', 'certain', 'ambiguity', 'scene', 'where', 'Hughes', 'more', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'return', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'want', 'find', 'objectively', 'film', 'most', 'responsibility', 'Plath', 'point', 'out', 'Wevill', 'would', 'eventually', 'kill', 'daughter', 'had', 'Hughes', 'using', 'gas', 'just', 'Plath', 'did', 'certainly', 'strike', 'additional', 'condemnation', 'well.Second', 'point', 'more', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'familiar', 'poetry', 'Plath', 'Hughes', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'devoid', 'work', 'Frieda', 'Hughes', 'Plath', 'daughter', 'literary', 'executor', 'refused', 'cooperate', 'producers', 'film', 'specifically', 'refusing', 'allow', 'access', 'mother', 'poetry', 'also', 'publicly', 'denounced', 'film', 'published', 'poem', 'own', 'quot', 'think/', 'should', 'give', 'mother', 'words/', 'fill', 'mouth', 'monster/', 'Sylvia', 'suicide', 'doll.', 'quot', 'Granted', 'difficult', 'make', 'film', 'literary', 'experience', 'writing', 'certainly', 'easier', 'are', 'dealing', 'poetry', 'drama', 'i.e.', 'quot', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'quot', 'novel', 'have', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'powerful', 'film', 'celebrated', 'Plath', 'creativity', 'same', 'time', 'hurtling', 'death.Plath', 'poems', 'were', 'passionate', 'death', 'can', 'well', 'imagine', 'who', 'have', 'committed', 'poems', 'memory', 'inserting', 'right', 'points', 'film', 'solid', 'performances', 'Paltrow', 'Craig', 'end', 'result', 'quot', 'Slyvia', 'quot', 'incomplete', 'performance', 'smacking', 'voyeurism', 'rather', 'attempt', 'understanding', 'would', 'be', 'akin', 'watching', 'quot', 'Amadeus', 'quot', 'music', 'quot', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'quot', 'paintings']",Sylvia

I was very surprised to find that Paltrow's portrayal of Sylvia Plath was, for the most part, somewhat one-dimensional.  One does not really see the depth of emotion in Paltrow's performance that one would get from reading Plath's poetry.  The show really belongs to Daniel Craig, who, in most of his movies, achieves a sense of being the ""mystery man.""  His Ted Hughes is fantastic, but the film tries to work around taking sides here.  Many have blamed Hughes for Plath's eventual suicide, but the film tries to remain neutral, only making things a bit confusing.  Are we supposed to like Hughes?  Are we supposed to believe that he was the cause of her death?  Remember, too, that Plath had already tried to commit suicide twice before.  This seems to be one of the faults in John Brownlow's writing.  Everyone but the actors seem new to film; Christine Jeffs has only directed one other film, and Brownlow has written for television, but not for film.  One of the other faults to this film is bringing in actors like Blythe Danner and Michael Gambon and not giving them a worthwhile part.  Danner does work hard at her small role as Plath's mother, as does Gambon as the downstairs neighbor, but anyone could really have done these jobs.  When I see extremely talented actors like Gambon and Danner, I expect to see greatness, not small bit parts.  Other than these problems, the story was decent, and Craig's acting carried the movie.  I wish Focus Features could have delivered something a bit better, but all I have seen is a decent, so-so adaptation of the life of Sylvia Plath.",3,"Not Bad, Not Bad",1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,1768,"['Being', 'fan', 'literature', 'film', 'expected', 'great', 'things', 'film', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'so-so', 'tale', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'disturbed', 'poets', 'American', 'literature', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'find', 'Paltrow', 'portrayal', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'somewhat', 'one-dimensional', 'One', 'not', 'really', 'see', 'depth', 'emotion', 'Paltrow', 'performance', 'one', 'would', 'get', 'reading', 'Plath', 'poetry', 'show', 'really', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'most', 'movies', 'sense', 'being', 'mystery', 'man', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'fantastic', 'film', 'tries', 'work', 'around', 'taking', 'sides', 'here', 'Many', 'have', 'blamed', 'Hughes', 'Plath', 'eventual', 'suicide', 'film', 'remain', 'neutral', 'only', 'making', 'things', 'bit', 'confusing', 'Are', 'supposed', 'like', 'Hughes', 'Are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'was', 'cause', 'death', 'Remember', 'too', 'Plath', 'had', 'already', 'tried', 'commit', 'suicide', 'twice', 'before', 'be', 'one', 'faults', 'John', 'Brownlow', 'writing', 'Everyone', 'actors', 'seem', 'new', 'film', 'Christine', 'Jeffs', 'only', 'directed', 'one', 'other', 'film', 'Brownlow', 'written', 'television', 'not', 'film', 'One', 'other', 'faults', 'film', 'bringing', 'actors', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'not', 'giving', 'worthwhile', 'part', 'Danner', 'work', 'hard', 'small', 'role', 'Plath', 'mother', 'Gambon', 'downstairs', 'neighbor', 'anyone', 'could', 'really', 'have', 'done', 'jobs', 'When', 'see', 'extremely', 'talented', 'actors', 'Gambon', 'Danner', 'expect', 'see', 'greatness', 'not', 'small', 'bit', 'parts', 'Other', 'problems', 'story', 'was', 'decent', 'Craig', 'acting', 'carried', 'movie', 'wish', 'Focus', 'Features', 'could', 'have', 'delivered', 'something', 'bit', 'better', 'have', 'seen', 'decent', 'so-so', 'adaptation', 'life', 'Sylvia', 'Plath']",Sylvia

619959,A3SF2N0BJF0YJS,B00005JMJD,N. Caine,"[6, 8]","I have a theory, one which largely influences this review.  I have found that true stories which make you say, &quot;That would make a great movie&quot; are the hardest to make a good movie of, and they often end up looking a lot like cliche television movies-of-the-week. This is probably due to the fact that the director and writer are locked into playing out the story elements.  The problem is compounded when the true story is a biography:  we inevitably get each of the most famous moments of the person's life dramatized in order.On the other hand, true stories which seem too simple to make good movies of, often become brilliant movies because there's so much room for the director to add subtety and humor.  Thus, two simple true stories produced the two best movies I've seen this year:  &quot;In America&quot; and &quot;Moonlight Mile.&quot;&quot;Sylvia&quot; is a perfect example of the former.  Reading through a book biography of Plath, or the lengthy Vanity Fair article biography, one can't help thinking, &quot;This would be a great movie!  I can just see this brash American girl in her scarlet dress nail handsome poet Hughes at a party.  I can just see him jumping up at a pub and reciting brilliant poetry.  I can just see her manic episodes come to life as these two great personalities clash.  And oh her famous ending dramatized!&quot;  But if you know her story at all, the movie lacks any creativity, and seems to just to dramatize each favorite moment scene by scene.  Do the actors or script provide some intimate interpretation of the story, one which makes us wonder?  Not really.  Paltrow is a beautiful and talented actress, but her casting was far too safe for the role, and she plays it by the book, while not capturing enough of Plath's Americaness.  It would have been interesting to see Scarlett Johannsen in that role --a woman I think looks more like Plath, and one who might fit the dresses and the settings of the era in a typically American way (i.e. less thin and pseudo-British than Paltrow).  It was hard for me to get past Paltrow as &quot;an actress playing Plath,&quot; especially when the script and direction provided no added subtlety to the story.  The director only seems interested in making the sets and locations truthful:  a common pitfall of directing biographies of famous people.If you know Plath's story, I think you'll be disappointed by the film.

Finally catching up with it on DVD, I give it high technical kudos(photographed extremely well, sound is superb).  As far as biography goes, however...I should say that I have been interested in Sylvia Plath since college.  While not the stereotypical angst-ridden college girl, my Plath-loving roommate was...But her interest finally inspired me to read the famous poems that this most famous suicide wrote.  Surprise!  They were *great*.  Plath's poems deserved all the notoriety they'd gotten.  And yes, when a body of work that's so famously dark(mostly)is the product of a woman who very famously killed herself, you DO want to learn more about the personal life of the poet.  And once you begin to delve into one or two Plath biographies-oh, my.  What a fascinating, infuriating, brilliant, troubled woman she was.  Truly, this was a life story that begs for a decent film treatment.  Sadly, after an opening credit sequence that perfectly captures the strange, haunting effect of Plath's poetry, the ""story"" of the film-that is, the screenplay-is pretty darn lame: a by-the-numbers romance of a troubled girl and her troubling husband.  And crimes of crimes-it's done *boringly*.  So much is glossed over-or wildly over-emphasized.  Real-life, documented events that were exciting are for some strange reason restaged to make them less so.  And there's zero chemistry between the ""passionate"" couple.  Daniel Craig is totally miscast as the man so handsomely LARGE that Plath's friend Anne Sexton called him ""Ted Huge"": he looks puny and unattractive.  Paltrow is trying much, much too hard to ""be"" Sylvia Plath; she should have just relaxed a bit(no matter how uptight the real woman was), been less ""careful"" with her every gesture. Better yet-they should have cast someone who looked less ""like"" Sylvia and embodied her better-Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Cate Blanchett, any number of great actresses could have helped.  But the fatal flaw is the lousy screenplay.

Zwick,"[4, 5]","***1/2 What is it about an artist dying young - particularly if it is at his or her own hands - that strikes such a deep chord in so many of us?  Is it the fact that this rare and special person achieves a kind of mastery of fate at the last moment, a perfect conclusion to this messy business of life that we mere mortals can never hope to attain?  Could it be that this early death is just one more instance of an artist taking the elements of raw reality and transforming them into something stylized, transcendent and meaningful for the rest of us to brood over and contemplate?  When poet and novelist Sylvia Plath committed suicide in 1963, she became the archetype of the tortured artist - particularly for sensitive young people who came to romanticize her end and her suffering in ways that lifted her and her work to iconic status.  The biopic, entitled simply ""Sylvia,"" gets the ""tortured"" part pretty much right, but has considerably less success with the ""artist.""The film focuses mainly on the tumultuous relationship between Plath and her husband of eight years, famed poet Ted Hughes.  The story begins in 1956 with their love-at-first-sight meeting when they were both students at Cambridge University.  The film moves quickly through the years, showing how, after a short period of relative marital bliss, Ted's philandering began to take its toll on the relationship.  As portrayed in the movie, Sylvia, despite her notable talent, is a mass of neuroses and insecurities, always toiling in the shadows of her (initially at least) much more well known and commercially successful husband.  But her feelings of inadequacy and jealousy over Ted's infidelities cannot, in and of themselves, entirely account for her paranoia, her outbursts of anger and her suicidal tendencies.  Those resulted mainly from the clinical depression that tormented the woman from the time of her father's death early in her childhood to her own tragic end.  The movie sidesteps the electroshock therapy Plath underwent at various times in her life (though it very subtly hints at them), yet the film still manages to convey just how great a victim she was of this disease she could not overcome.Thanks to John Brownlow`s rather singlemindedly depressing screenplay, there's a tremendous feeling of sadness hovering over the film.  Director Christine Jeffs brings a raw intensity to many of the confrontation scenes involving the pain-wracked, benighted couple.  As Sylvia and Ted, Gwyneth Paltrow and Daniel Craig give rich, moving and sensitive performances, and Michael Gambon leaves his mark as a sympathetic neighbor who tries but does not succeed at saving Sylvia.If there is a flaw in ""Sylvia,"" it is one common to films that attempt to portray the lives of artists, particularly writers.  Although a scenarist can dramatize the details of an artist`s life, it is virtually impossible for him to capture the richness and power of the art itself in the different medium of film.  We never get the sense of how Sylvia either overcomes the difficulties of her life to succeed in her writing or how she uses those difficulties to enhance her art.  What we do get is a few shots of Sylvia sitting in front of a typewriter, a comment or two about a book that has been or is soon to be published, a few references to critical reviews, and a smattering of voiceover recitations of Plath's poetry.  What we don't get and what it is virtually impossible for film to capture is the essence of the writing itself.  For this, one needs to return to the source material, the works that have lived on after the woman herself all these years.  If the movie inspires new people to explore Sylvia Plath's writing, it will not have been in vain.",3,Ok bio but misses some of the spirit of its subject,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,3727,"['***1/2', 'What', 'artist', 'dying', 'young', 'particularly', 'own', 'hands', 'strikes', 'such', 'deep', 'chord', 'so', 'many', 'fact', 'rare', 'special', 'person', 'kind', 'mastery', 'fate', 'last', 'moment', 'perfect', 'conclusion', 'messy', 'business', 'life', 'mere', 'mortals', 'can', 'never', 'hope', 'attain', 'Could', 'be', 'early', 'death', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'instance', 'artist', 'taking', 'elements', 'raw', 'reality', 'transforming', 'something', 'stylized', 'transcendent', 'meaningful', 'rest', 'brood', 'contemplate', 'When', 'poet', 'novelist', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'committed', 'suicide', '1963', 'became', 'archetype', 'tortured', 'artist', 'particularly', 'sensitive', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'came', 'romanticize', 'end', 'suffering', 'ways', 'lifted', 'work', 'iconic', 'status', 'biopic', 'entitled', 'simply', 'Sylvia', 'tortured', 'part', 'pretty', 'much', 'right', 'considerably', 'less', 'success', 'artist', 'film', 'mainly', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'Plath', 'husband', 'eight', 'years', 'famed', 'poet', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'story', '1956', 'love-at-first-sight', 'meeting', 'when', 'were', 'students', 'Cambridge', 'University', 'film', 'moves', 'quickly', 'years', 'showing', 'how', 'short', 'period', 'relative', 'marital', 'bliss', 'Ted', 'philandering', 'began', 'take', 'toll', 'relationship', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'Sylvia', 'notable', 'talent', 'mass', 'neuroses', 'insecurities', 'always', 'toiling', 'shadows', 'initially', 'least', 'much', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'commercially', 'successful', 'husband', 'feelings', 'inadequacy', 'jealousy', 'Ted', 'infidelities', 'can', 'not', 'entirely', 'account', 'paranoia', 'outbursts', 'anger', 'suicidal', 'tendencies', 'resulted', 'mainly', 'clinical', 'depression', 'tormented', 'woman', 'time', 'father', 'death', 'early', 'childhood', 'own', 'tragic', 'end', 'movie', 'electroshock', 'therapy', 'Plath', 'underwent', 'various', 'times', 'life', 'very', 'subtly', 'hints', 'yet', 'film', 'still', 'convey', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'victim', 'was', 'disease', 'could', 'not', 'overcome.Thanks', 'John', 'Brownlow', 's', 'rather', 'singlemindedly', 'depressing', 'screenplay', 'tremendous', 'feeling', 'sadness', 'hovering', 'film', 'Director', 'Christine', 'Jeffs', 'raw', 'intensity', 'many', 'confrontation', 'involving', 'pain-wracked', 'benighted', 'couple', 'Sylvia', 'Ted', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'give', 'rich', 'moving', 'sensitive', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'mark', 'sympathetic', 'neighbor', 'who', 'not', 'succeed', 'saving', 'Sylvia.If', 'flaw', 'Sylvia', 'one', 'common', 'films', 'attempt', 'portray', 'lives', 'artists', 'particularly', 'writers', 'scenarist', 'can', 'dramatize', 'details', 'artist', 's', 'life', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'capture', 'richness', 'power', 'art', 'different', 'medium', 'film', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'Sylvia', 'difficulties', 'life', 'succeed', 'writing', 'how', 'difficulties', 'enhance', 'art', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'few', 'shots', 'Sylvia', 'sitting', 'front', 'typewriter', 'comment', 'two', 'book', 'been', 'soon', 'be', 'published', 'few', 'references', 'critical', 'reviews', 'smattering', 'voiceover', 'recitations', 'Plath', 'poetry', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'film', 'capture', 'essence', 'writing', 'one', 'return', 'source', 'material', 'works', 'have', 'lived', 'woman', 'years', 'movie', 'new', 'people', 'explore', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'writing', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'vain']",Sylvia

Whitney ""Ross Whitney""","[0, 0]","Competent photographers and cinematographers take care that the light sources for their photography do not bounce from highly reflective surfaces into the camera lens. If, for example, a studio light reflects from a wall painted with high-gloss paint, it will be recorded on film as an annoying and distracting mass of glaring white behind the subject being photographed. It will overwhelm and disturb the balance, between foreground and background, that everyone expects in a good photography&#8212;and, as a result, make the viewer uneasy. The film director, Christine Jeffs, violates the convention again and again, especially in the rooms occupied by Plath and Hughes. It always reminds us, subliminally or otherwise, that things are out of kilter between these two principal characters. Such techniques are extremely effective at establishing this feeling. Some of the walls almost appear to be oiled. In addition to that, the walls are of the colors we associate with comic book art: garish but somber shades of green, blue, gray or yellow. It is an externalizing of an internal state: the descent, by Plath, into madness&#8212;or alternately, during Plath's manic moments of ecstasy, an ascent into it. If Ted Hughes&#8217; goal in the movie is success, Sylvia Plath&#8217;s goal seems to be death and the peaceful annihilation she believes it will bring. The rooms they inhabit are cramped, claustrophobic, and maze-like. They are abodes dreamed up in a nightmare. Even the sunniest outdoor scenes, and even the most optimistic encounters in their relationship, always present a sense of foreboding, peril and grief. The fine musical score contributes greatly to the effect, and it supplements the visuals perfectly.However well or poorly the film conveys the actual life story of Plath, it is a brilliant piece of art. All the performances are engagingly convincing. Scenes in which Gwyneth Paltrow&#8217;s mother plays Plath&#8217;s mother are fascinating. How a young, driven artist would interact with a highly cultured and sensitive mother is captured magnificently. Some Amazon reviewers have complained that Paltrow&#8217;s performance is shallow or flat. On the contrary, it is delivered with subtlety, nuance, and multiple layers of depth. Plath was a person torn by doubt and uncertainty, fluctuating between manic highs and desperately depressing lows. That one can&#8217;t easily get a handle on the complexities of Plath&#8217;s character may lead one to believe that she is not adequately revealed. But the important thing is that her inadequacies are sublimely well revealed. And that is the point of the movie.This work of brilliance is intended to raise more questions than can be answered. It does not satisfy in the way nearly all movies do. Indeed, it is as unsatisfying and puzzling as real life so often tends to be. This film was designed to haunt the viewer&#8217;s consciousness, and it does. An anguished soul struggles for light, finds it (though still immersed in darkness), and loses it in death. That there&#8217;s nothing neat about this story or it&#8217;s resolution is for many viewers unsatisfactory. For this viewer, this is cinematic art at its profoundest.",5,A brilliant work,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,3202,"['Competent', 'photographers', 'cinematographers', 'take', 'care', 'light', 'sources', 'photography', 'do', 'not', 'bounce', 'highly', 'reflective', 'surfaces', 'camera', 'example', 'studio', 'light', 'wall', 'painted', 'high-gloss', 'paint', 'will', 'be', 'recorded', 'film', 'annoying', 'distracting', 'mass', 'glaring', 'white', 'subject', 'being', 'photographed', 'will', 'overwhelm', 'disturb', 'balance', 'foreground', 'background', 'everyone', 'good', 'photography', '8212', 'result', 'make', 'viewer', 'uneasy', 'film', 'director', 'Christine', 'Jeffs', 'convention', 'again', 'again', 'especially', 'rooms', 'occupied', 'Plath', 'Hughes', 'always', 'subliminally', 'otherwise', 'things', 'are', 'kilter', 'two', 'principal', 'characters', 'Such', 'techniques', 'are', 'extremely', 'effective', 'establishing', 'feeling', 'walls', 'almost', 'appear', 'be', 'oiled', 'addition', 'walls', 'are', 'colors', 'associate', 'comic', 'book', 'art', 'garish', 'somber', 'shades', 'green', 'blue', 'gray', 'yellow', 'externalizing', 'internal', 'state', 'descent', 'Plath', 'madness', '8212', 'alternately', 'Plath', 'manic', 'moments', 'ecstasy', 'ascent', 'Ted', 'Hughes', '8217', 'goal', 'movie', 'success', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', '8217', 's', 'goal', 'be', 'death', 'peaceful', 'annihilation', 'will', 'bring', 'rooms', 'inhabit', 'are', 'cramped', 'claustrophobic', 'maze-like', 'are', 'abodes', 'dreamed', 'up', 'nightmare', 'Even', 'sunniest', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'even', 'most', 'optimistic', 'encounters', 'relationship', 'always', 'present', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'peril', 'grief', 'fine', 'musical', 'score', 'contributes', 'greatly', 'effect', 'visuals', 'perfectly.However', 'well', 'poorly', 'film', 'conveys', 'actual', 'life', 'story', 'Plath', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'art', 'performances', 'are', 'engagingly', 'convincing', 'Scenes', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', '8217', 'mother', 'plays', 'Plath', '8217', 'mother', 'are', 'fascinating', 'How', 'young', 'driven', 'artist', 'would', 'interact', 'highly', 'cultured', 'sensitive', 'mother', 'captured', 'magnificently', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'Paltrow', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'shallow', 'flat', 'contrary', 'delivered', 'subtlety', 'nuance', 'multiple', 'layers', 'depth', 'Plath', 'was', 'person', 'torn', 'doubt', 'uncertainty', 'fluctuating', 'manic', 'highs', 'desperately', 'depressing', 'lows', 'one', 'can', '8217', 'easily', 'get', 'handle', 'complexities', 'Plath', '8217', 's', 'character', 'may', 'lead', 'one', 'believe', 'not', 'adequately', 'revealed', 'important', 'thing', 'inadequacies', 'are', 'sublimely', 'well', 'revealed', 'point', 'movie.This', 'work', 'brilliance', 'intended', 'raise', 'more', 'questions', 'can', 'be', 'answered', 'not', 'satisfy', 'way', 'nearly', 'movies', 'do', 'Indeed', 'unsatisfying', 'puzzling', 'real', 'life', 'so', 'often', 'be', 'film', 'was', 'designed', 'haunt', 'viewer', '8217', 's', 'consciousness', 'anguished', 'soul', 'light', 'still', 'immersed', 'darkness', 'death', '8217', 'nothing', 'neat', 'story', '8217', 's', 'resolution', 'many', 'viewers', 'unsatisfactory', 'viewer', 'cinematic', 'art', 'profoundest']",Sylvia

Paltrow gets a sense of this across but only to the degree that we see how this ingrained trait destroyed her relationship with Hughes and ultimatey her. Paltrow gives a credible performance as I feel the sense of lacking derives from a ""phase"" focussed script, that is that the script looks solely at the struggles of the Hughes/Plath relationship and their need to both achieve in the literary world and steer a smooth personal course which gave both what they needed. The film pays lip service to Sylvia's sense of early loss and the damage this inflicted on her adult personality, which in my estimation, left her feeling half a soul and half a bleak and empty vessel filled only with pain and pointlessness. In this sense the potrayal, intense as it is, displays a woman who is desperately needy and at times intensely irritating and fickle, for no apparant reason.A woman who seemingly sows the seeds of her own destruction, with little sense of the root of her desperate and highly damaged sense of self, to add this dimension would have done Plath more credit.The portayal from script, of Hughes is infinitely more sympathetic and one feels a truer sense of his attempt to provide Plath with all she her needs, and the growing realisation that this is impossible and that he will fall foul of her focussed destruction and seemingly powerless to change it, it seems here his affair was almost inevitable. An interesting point which would have displayed the toxicity of Plaths inner most destruction is that the woman Hughes left her for killed herself and her daughter just three years after Sylvia died.As good as Paltrow is I could not help feel an older actress may have brought the sense of who and why Sylvia was rahter just give us a one dimesional portrayal of her destruction and creation. But I imagine her in lies the quandry since Plath was just 31 when she died so to give the role to say a Meryl Streep just would not work chronologically. Craig's performance was the better of the two for me, so intensley studied as to get both the accent and sound of Hughes absolutely perfect.A worthy attempt all round, nonetheless, to convey some of what was an enormously interesting and tortured life.",4,Distinctly lacking a sense of Sylvia...,1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,2331,"['fudemental', 'truth', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'was', 'life', 'almost', 'constantly', 'balanced', 'creation', 'destruction', 'Paltrow', 'sense', 'across', 'only', 'degree', 'see', 'how', 'ingrained', 'trait', 'destroyed', 'relationship', 'Hughes', 'ultimatey', 'Paltrow', 'credible', 'performance', 'feel', 'sense', 'lacking', 'derives', 'phase', 'focussed', 'script', 'script', 'solely', 'struggles', 'Hughes/Plath', 'relationship', 'need', 'achieve', 'literary', 'world', 'steer', 'smooth', 'personal', 'course', 'gave', 'what', 'needed', 'film', 'lip', 'service', 'Sylvia', 'sense', 'early', 'loss', 'damage', 'inflicted', 'adult', 'personality', 'estimation', 'left', 'feeling', 'soul', 'bleak', 'empty', 'vessel', 'filled', 'only', 'pain', 'pointlessness', 'sense', 'potrayal', 'intense', 'woman', 'who', 'desperately', 'needy', 'times', 'intensely', 'irritating', 'fickle', 'apparant', 'reason.A', 'woman', 'who', 'seemingly', 'seeds', 'own', 'destruction', 'little', 'sense', 'root', 'desperate', 'highly', 'damaged', 'sense', 'self', 'add', 'dimension', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'Plath', 'more', 'credit.The', 'portayal', 'script', 'Hughes', 'infinitely', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'one', 'truer', 'sense', 'attempt', 'provide', 'Plath', 'needs', 'growing', 'realisation', 'impossible', 'will', 'fall', 'foul', 'focussed', 'destruction', 'seemingly', 'powerless', 'change', 'here', 'affair', 'was', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'interesting', 'point', 'would', 'have', 'displayed', 'toxicity', 'Plaths', 'inner', 'most', 'destruction', 'woman', 'Hughes', 'left', 'killed', 'herself', 'daughter', 'just', 'three', 'years', 'Sylvia', 'died.As', 'good', 'Paltrow', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'older', 'actress', 'may', 'have', 'brought', 'sense', 'who', 'why', 'Sylvia', 'was', 'rahter', 'just', 'give', 'one', 'dimesional', 'portrayal', 'destruction', 'creation', 'imagine', 'quandry', 'Plath', 'was', 'just', '31', 'when', 'died', 'so', 'give', 'role', 'say', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'just', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'chronologically', 'Craig', 'performance', 'was', 'better', 'two', 'so', 'intensley', 'studied', 'get', 'accent', 'sound', 'Hughes', 'absolutely', 'worthy', 'round', 'nonetheless', 'convey', 'what', 'was', 'enormously', 'interesting', 'tortured', 'life']",Sylvia

The movie focuses on the marriage of Plath and Ted Hughes (played diffidently by Daniel Craig), who was at least at the time the more famous poet.It's really impossible to capture on film what made Plath and Hughes talented writers. They gaze into the distance, have an inspiration, write it down. At least in the movie POLLOCK we got to see the result of all the brow furrowing. There's a lot more attention paid to Plath's mental illness, but only on a superficial level. Plath is unhappy almost constantly, but because of the lack of context, it seems like all her problems are caused because Hughes isn't nice to her.I suspect it was a good deal more complicated than that.

A film just draws more attention that way.That is where where I was left wanting in this...that I didn't believe that it was jealousy that unravelled her, or that had he ""made her happy"" she would not have killed herself. The illness was there, and the death of her father brought it to the surface for the first time. It was a disease.The fascinating thing about the disease of mental illness, is that the same thing that disconnects a person from the world around them, seems to be the thing that enables them to be extra sensitive to other sensations, and maybe to their own inner workings as well. My favorite line of the movie is when she says that the truth loves her. She sees more.I think that we're learning more and more that it is a myth to think that a person cannot be creative or tap into genius without continually slipping into insanity, or risking it.

You will see Ms. Paltrow, who did a really good job, and you will see beautifully shot images, and ... that's all.Though the film is titled 'Sylvia,' it is mainly about the relations between her and Ted Hughes.  Probably you are a kind of movie fan who want to see this 'high-brow' drama, so you don't need any further explanations about them.  I only add that it starts with their Cambridge days, and ends with the fatal day and the gas oven.Now, the problem is this; 'Sylvia' sidesteps many questions about her complicated life, concentrating too much on the turbulent relations with Ted Hughes.

Sylvia's life thus is portrayed as a painful one, as the housewife playing the second violin or neglected wife who must stay at home, but clearly, these pains, immediate and real as they are, do not explain the personality of Plath.  And that personality is only to be found in her poems.Good acting from Gwyneth Paltrow as Plath, Daniel Craig as Hughes, Jared Harris, Michael Gambon, and very clever casting of the real-life mother of Paltrow Blyth Danner as Sylvia's mother, good music score (thanks to Gabriel Yared, 'Cold Mountain'), and good period costumes by Sandy Powell ('Shakespeare in Love').

619974,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B00005JMJD,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[3, 4]","Sylvia Plath was a woman living a relatively normal life as a poet. Her husband, fellow poet Ted Hughes, eventually maintained an affair and left her. Sylvia was devastated and later killed herself. The story is a simple one; in fact, some suggest that had Plath not been famous most would consider it a tale not worth telling on screen at all. Though I agreed in my initial reaction to the film, as I think about it more the film is not simply a feminist accusation against men and how their actions drive women to ""the edge,"" but it is a quiet, minor study of depression and its effects.With poetic camera work and Gwyneth Paltrow's subtle but shattering turn, Christine Jeffs has much to work with. Though the story rolls along much too slowly and without anything new to add to infidelity in cinema, what she shows us about depression is interesting. Some say Hughes was to blame for Plath's suicide, but isn't it really Plath's depression that would eventually lead her to take such action? I'm not saying that Jeffs intends to shed positive light on Hughes' actions as a husband. What I'm saying is that the depression exhibited in ""Sylvia"" is the self-destructive sort; it throws away rationality and causes one to make impulsive, unwise decisions one would not necessarily make otherwise. Thus, Plath's suicide becomes all the more devastating and relevant. Though the film certainly does not represent all aspects of her suicide, I would like to take note of its correct decision in making depression almost a character in itself, directing Plath in most of what she did in her later life, even inspiring some of what are considered her masterworks.Depression numbs the mind and soul of human beings. In Plath's piece ""Lady Lazarus,"" her attempted suicides are spoken of with nonchalance, as if she were simply playing some game at a fair over and over till she won a teddy bear for her lover. While these facts revealed themselves throughout the film, all I could think was of the utter malignancy of intense depression; though Jeffs was not successful in pacing, she provokes an appropriate amount of thought. If only the film had been as passionate, haunting, and beautiful as Plath's poetry, then it would have been truly memorable.",3,Hmm...more like three-and-a-half stars,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,2245,"['Sylvia', 'Plath', 'was', 'woman', 'living', 'relatively', 'normal', 'life', 'poet', 'husband', 'fellow', 'poet', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'eventually', 'maintained', 'affair', 'left', 'Sylvia', 'was', 'devastated', 'later', 'killed', 'story', 'simple', 'one', 'fact', 'suggest', 'had', 'Plath', 'not', 'been', 'famous', 'most', 'would', 'consider', 'tale', 'not', 'worth', 'telling', 'screen', 'agreed', 'initial', 'reaction', 'film', 'think', 'more', 'film', 'not', 'simply', 'feminist', 'accusation', 'men', 'how', 'actions', 'drive', 'women', 'edge', 'quiet', 'minor', 'study', 'depression', 'effects.With', 'poetic', 'camera', 'work', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'subtle', 'shattering', 'turn', 'Christine', 'Jeffs', 'much', 'work', 'story', 'along', 'much', 'too', 'slowly', 'anything', 'new', 'add', 'infidelity', 'cinema', 'what', 'depression', 'interesting', 'say', 'Hughes', 'was', 'blame', 'Plath', 'suicide', ""n't"", 'really', 'Plath', 'depression', 'would', 'eventually', 'lead', 'take', 'such', 'action', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Jeffs', 'shed', 'positive', 'light', 'Hughes', 'actions', 'husband', 'What', ""'m"", 'saying', 'depression', 'exhibited', 'Sylvia', 'self-destructive', 'sort', 'away', 'rationality', 'one', 'make', 'impulsive', 'unwise', 'decisions', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'necessarily', 'make', 'otherwise', 'Thus', 'Plath', 'suicide', 'more', 'devastating', 'relevant', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'represent', 'aspects', 'suicide', 'would', 'like', 'take', 'note', 'correct', 'decision', 'making', 'depression', 'almost', 'character', 'directing', 'Plath', 'most', 'what', 'did', 'later', 'life', 'even', 'inspiring', 'what', 'are', 'considered', 'masterworks.Depression', 'mind', 'soul', 'human', 'beings', 'Plath', 'piece', 'Lady', 'Lazarus', 'attempted', 'suicides', 'are', 'spoken', 'nonchalance', 'were', 'simply', 'playing', 'game', 'fair', 'till', 'won', 'teddy', 'bear', 'lover', 'facts', 'revealed', 'film', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'utter', 'malignancy', 'intense', 'depression', 'Jeffs', 'was', 'not', 'successful', 'pacing', 'appropriate', 'amount', 'thought', 'only', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'passionate', 'haunting', 'beautiful', 'Plath', 'poetry', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'memorable']",Sylvia
