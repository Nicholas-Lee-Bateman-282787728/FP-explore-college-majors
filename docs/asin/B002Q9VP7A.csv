The only reason I continued was hope that they would in fact get some part of the history correct.There were 2 other attempts of people from Donner Pass trying to leave for help, but due to the weather were pushed back, this is when the idea of snow shoes come into play and the 15 forlorn Hope head out to California. With Stanton and his guides, there is only one native guide with Stanton in the film when there was in fact 2, that showed up with him in that camp.Finally at 55 min into the movie you get some historic accuracy when the men draw sticks, and the short stick offers up their own life to feed the others in the party.The surviving members were not found, but came across an Indian village that sheltered and fed them, then guided them to the town.Of the original 87 members? There was 91 that were in the original Donner party. This movie wasn't about the Donner party, but some uneducated view of the forlorn Hope, which is how this movie should have been Accurately named.They leave you to think that the Eddy house hold was selfish, and uncaring of the other members of the party, when Mrs. Eddy, never turned anyone away from food,giving what little she could spare, especially to the children. Though to keep herself and child safe, the party never new how much meat she had. Only one member of the Donner party Camp had partaken in human flesh, and that was well after the second group of rescuers took survivors over the mountain to California.Movies like this, with their inaccuracy, uninformed, and unorganized research is what leads people to the wrong conclusion. Everyone associates the Donner Party with Cannibalism, when in fact it was the Forlorn Hope, and surviving 7 that were the cannibals.",1,Beyond irritating,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,1945,"['research', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'research', 'information', 'learn', '7th', '8th', 'grade', 'tragic', 'event', 'so', 'completely', 'base', 'was', 'hardly', 'bearable', 'watch', 'only', 'reason', 'continued', 'was', 'hope', 'would', 'fact', 'get', 'part', 'history', 'were', '2', 'other', 'attempts', 'people', 'Donner', 'Pass', 'trying', 'leave', 'help', 'due', 'weather', 'were', 'pushed', 'back', 'when', 'idea', 'snow', 'shoes', 'come', 'play', '15', 'forlorn', 'Hope', 'head', 'California', 'Stanton', 'guides', 'only', 'one', 'native', 'guide', 'Stanton', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'fact', '2', 'showed', 'up', 'camp.Finally', '55', 'min', 'movie', 'get', 'historic', 'accuracy', 'when', 'men', 'draw', 'sticks', 'short', 'stick', 'up', 'own', 'life', 'feed', 'others', 'party.The', 'surviving', 'members', 'were', 'not', 'found', 'came', 'Indian', 'village', 'sheltered', 'fed', 'then', 'guided', 'town.Of', 'original', '87', 'members', 'was', '91', 'were', 'original', 'Donner', 'party', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'Donner', 'party', 'uneducated', 'view', 'forlorn', 'Hope', 'how', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Accurately', 'named.They', 'leave', 'think', 'Eddy', 'house', 'hold', 'was', 'selfish', 'uncaring', 'other', 'members', 'party', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Eddy', 'never', 'turned', 'anyone', 'away', 'food', 'giving', 'what', 'little', 'could', 'spare', 'especially', 'children', 'keep', 'child', 'safe', 'party', 'never', 'new', 'how', 'much', 'meat', 'had', 'Only', 'one', 'member', 'Donner', 'party', 'Camp', 'had', 'partaken', 'human', 'flesh', 'was', 'well', 'second', 'group', 'rescuers', 'took', 'survivors', 'mountain', 'California.Movies', 'inaccuracy', 'uninformed', 'unorganized', 'research', 'what', 'people', 'wrong', 'conclusion', 'Everyone', 'Donner', 'Party', 'Cannibalism', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'Forlorn', 'Hope', 'surviving', '7', 'were', 'cannibals']",N/A

1283720,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B002Q9VP7A,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[31, 33]","This movie, with some moderately well-known actors in the cast, never seems to have had a general release before going to DVD. As such, and strictly speaking, it is not about the Donner Party itself, trapped high in the Sierra Nevada Mountains over the winter of 1847-47. The plot really focuses on an element of that party, who called themselves the Forlorn Hope, and made a desperate gamble to walk out of the mountains on snowshoes: They took sparingly of supplies, hoping to leave more for those remaining behind, and set out for the nearest settlement down in the foothills below. In this version of the story, the Forlorn Hope includes an older man, Franklin Graves (Mark Boone, Jr.) and his two daughters, William Eddy (Clayne Crawford) and his hired man, William Foster (Crispin Gover), the best hunter among the party, who left his own wife and child behind. Charles Stanton (Christian Kane) has come from Sutter's fort with a meager amount of supplies, and Louis, a Mexican-Indian muleteer: they will guide the rest of the party to safety - or so it is hoped. But their hopes slowly unravel, in the face of misery, starvation, madness - and murder.Alas, this account is not strictly accurate in historical detail: There had been no food cached for them by Stanton, farther down the mountains. There was no drawing of lots, for one of the party to be killed in order to feed the rest - although it was discussed, at least once, according to survivors. There were two murders committed during the ordeal of the Forlorn Hope, but not in the way depicted in this account. The sense of despair, and the slow dissolving of so-called civilized norms are probably fairly accurate, as well as incidents such as Eddy's wife hiding a portion of dried meat in his pack, and of how he was able to bring down a deer to feed the survivors. Something of the bleakness of their experience is reflected in the colors - in that it seems there is barely any color at all. The snow is white, the trees seem black against the sky, their trunks are gray. The characters are dressed all in dark colors - seemingly only a splash of blood now and again makes any color at all.I was actually quite interested in reviewing this DVD, having written a novel, about a pioneer wagon-train party being stranded under the same circumstances and in the same place -To Truckee's Trail- a party which proceeded the Donner Party by several years, but which survived their ordeal, and emerged from it with all members alive and in good health. So I watched this with a an especially critical eye for period detail - which was excellent. With regard to absolute historical fidelity, there were some liberties taken, as noted above. This is a movie which does manage to be psychologically accurate in relating a true story - but at the end, having put the characters and the audience through a wringer, concludes without any other resolution or insight other than having demonstrated what people are capable of doing to survive. Perhaps that was the point - but I would have liked to have been drawn into knowing a deeper knowledge about each character.One final curiosity: ""The Donner Party"" was shot on location in and around Truckee, California, where the original Donner Party was stranded, and along the trail followed by the Forlorn Hope.",3,Forlorn Hope in the Sierra Nevada,1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,3313,"['movie', 'moderately', 'well-known', 'actors', 'cast', 'never', 'have', 'had', 'general', 'release', 'going', 'DVD', 'such', 'strictly', 'speaking', 'not', 'Donner', 'Party', 'trapped', 'high', 'Sierra', 'Nevada', 'Mountains', 'winter', '1847-47', 'plot', 'really', 'element', 'party', 'who', 'called', 'Forlorn', 'Hope', 'made', 'desperate', 'gamble', 'walk', 'mountains', 'snowshoes', 'took', 'sparingly', 'supplies', 'hoping', 'leave', 'more', 'remaining', 'behind', 'set', 'out', 'nearest', 'settlement', 'down', 'foothills', 'version', 'story', 'Forlorn', 'Hope', 'older', 'man', 'Franklin', 'Graves', 'Mark', 'Boone', 'Jr.', 'two', 'daughters', 'William', 'Eddy', 'Clayne', 'Crawford', 'hired', 'man', 'William', 'Foster', 'Crispin', 'Gover', 'best', 'hunter', 'party', 'who', 'left', 'own', 'wife', 'child', 'behind', 'Charles', 'Stanton', 'Christian', 'Kane', 'come', 'Sutter', 'fort', 'meager', 'amount', 'supplies', 'Louis', 'Mexican-Indian', 'muleteer', 'will', 'guide', 'rest', 'party', 'safety', 'hoped', 'hopes', 'slowly', 'unravel', 'face', 'misery', 'starvation', 'madness', 'murder.Alas', 'account', 'not', 'strictly', 'accurate', 'historical', 'detail', 'had', 'been', 'no', 'food', 'cached', 'Stanton', 'farther', 'mountains', 'was', 'drawing', 'lots', 'one', 'party', 'be', 'killed', 'order', 'feed', 'rest', 'was', 'discussed', 'least', 'once', 'according', 'survivors', 'were', 'two', 'murders', 'committed', 'ordeal', 'Forlorn', 'Hope', 'not', 'way', 'depicted', 'account', 'sense', 'despair', 'slow', 'dissolving', 'so-called', 'civilized', 'norms', 'are', 'probably', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'as', 'well', 'incidents', 'such', 'Eddy', 'wife', 'hiding', 'portion', 'dried', 'meat', 'pack', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'bring', 'down', 'deer', 'feed', 'survivors', 'Something', 'bleakness', 'experience', 'reflected', 'colors', 'barely', 'color', 'snow', 'white', 'trees', 'seem', 'black', 'sky', 'trunks', 'are', 'gray', 'characters', 'are', 'dressed', 'dark', 'colors', 'seemingly', 'only', 'splash', 'blood', 'now', 'again', 'color', 'all.I', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'interested', 'reviewing', 'DVD', 'having', 'written', 'novel', 'pioneer', 'wagon-train', 'party', 'being', 'stranded', 'same', 'circumstances', 'same', 'place', '-To', 'Truckee', 'Trail-', 'party', 'proceeded', 'Donner', 'Party', 'several', 'years', 'survived', 'ordeal', 'emerged', 'members', 'alive', 'good', 'health', 'watched', 'especially', 'critical', 'eye', 'period', 'detail', 'was', 'excellent', 'regard', 'absolute', 'historical', 'fidelity', 'were', 'liberties', 'taken', 'noted', 'movie', 'manage', 'be', 'psychologically', 'accurate', 'relating', 'true', 'story', 'end', 'having', 'put', 'characters', 'audience', 'wringer', 'concludes', 'other', 'resolution', 'insight', 'other', 'having', 'demonstrated', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'capable', 'doing', 'survive', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'point', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'knowing', 'deeper', 'knowledge', 'character.One', 'final', 'curiosity', 'Donner', 'Party', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Truckee', 'California', 'where', 'original', 'Donner', 'Party', 'was', 'stranded', 'trail', 'followed', 'Forlorn', 'Hope']",N/A
1283721,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B002Q9VP7A,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[1, 1]","My mother is a huge history fanatic when it comes to stories of the Donner party. During this film she didn't say much, except to interject with little bits of history that the movie either didn't include or got wrong. Even with my love for Crispin Glover, I couldn't make up my mind as to what my true feelings were for this movie.The film says that it covers the Donner party when it only covers the group ""The Forlorn Hope"" that left to find help from civilization. A band of survivors set out with only one person (Eddy) knowing how to hunt for food, so before long they have to resort to cannibalism in order to survive.Really... there's a huge amount of glaring errors here. Like one reviewer said, there's scenes where a seemingly hobbled together cabin shows an interior that's far bigger than what it should be, complete with tables & other fixtures that shouldn't be there. Settlers did travel with some furniture, but nothing like this & after most of the livestock was killed for food or taken by thieves, the heaviest stuff (aka the furniture) would have been the first to go. Since stuff like that would've been hard to build, it really is something that I can't see being all that realistic. Plus they have one of the characters (Foster) unable to shoot at the beginning of the film, yet when he has to take a character off into the woods he suddenly becomes a sharpshooter capable of killing a man from over 6-10 feet away.The actors try their hardest & the movie was decent enough that I finished it, but it felt like it was more than a bit of a chore to slog through. By the time the movie finished, I couldn't help but think that the film could've been far shorter... and then I realized that the film was already short enough as it was. There's really not a lot of plot here & my two sentence synopsis above really is the whole gist of the movie. There's not a lot of character development & rather than show HOW the settlers got into such a bad predicament (a fascinating story in its own right) or show how the settlers back at the camp were faring, we're treated to scene after scene of Glover & company whining about how hungry they are. Oh, and we're supposed to cheer for Eddy, who has been treated as being the ""good guy"" of the movie who is the only one who is smart enough to conserve food & attempts to keep from cannibalism. By the end of the film I just didn't care what happened to any of them. I would have been able to overlook the historical inaccuracies if the film was great, but unfortunately this film isn't. It's mediocre at best, which disappoints me because usually Glover films are brilliantly done.After the film was said & done, I couldn't make up my mind whether or not to give this one, two or three stars. In the end I figured I'd give it two. I managed to finish the film, but the more I think about the movie, the less I seem to like it. If you're looking for something to kill an hour & a half, I recommend looking for some of the documentaries out there or going for the movie ""Alive"". This film really doesn't do the true story of the Donner Party justice, which is a shame. The true story & all of the legends surrounding this story are fascinating in their own right.",2,Still not sure if I liked it or not...,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,3223,"['mother', 'huge', 'history', 'fanatic', 'when', 'stories', 'Donner', 'party', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'interject', 'little', 'bits', 'history', 'movie', 'either', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'got', 'wrong', 'Even', 'love', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'true', 'feelings', 'were', 'movie.The', 'film', 'Donner', 'party', 'when', 'only', 'group', 'Forlorn', 'Hope', 'left', 'find', 'help', 'civilization', 'band', 'survivors', 'set', 'out', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'Eddy', 'knowing', 'how', 'hunt', 'food', 'so', 'before', 'long', 'have', 'resort', 'cannibalism', 'order', 'survive.Really', 'huge', 'amount', 'glaring', 'errors', 'here', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'scenes', 'where', 'seemingly', 'hobbled', 'together', 'cabin', 'interior', 'far', 'bigger', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'complete', 'tables', 'other', 'fixtures', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'there', 'Settlers', 'did', 'travel', 'furniture', 'nothing', 'most', 'livestock', 'was', 'killed', 'food', 'taken', 'thieves', 'heaviest', 'stuff', 'furniture', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'go', 'stuff', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hard', 'build', 'really', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'realistic', 'have', 'one', 'characters', 'Foster', 'unable', 'shoot', 'beginning', 'film', 'yet', 'when', 'take', 'character', 'off', 'woods', 'suddenly', 'sharpshooter', 'capable', 'killing', 'man', '6-10', 'feet', 'away.The', 'actors', 'try', 'hardest', 'movie', 'was', 'decent', 'enough', 'finished', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'bit', 'chore', 'slog', 'time', 'movie', 'finished', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'far', 'shorter', 'then', 'realized', 'film', 'was', 'already', 'short', 'enough', 'was', 'really', 'not', 'lot', 'plot', 'here', 'two', 'sentence', 'synopsis', 'really', 'whole', 'gist', 'movie', 'not', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'rather', 'show', 'HOW', 'settlers', 'got', 'such', 'bad', 'predicament', 'fascinating', 'story', 'own', 'right', 'show', 'how', 'settlers', 'back', 'camp', 'were', 'faring', ""'re"", 'treated', 'scene', 'scene', 'Glover', 'company', 'whining', 'how', 'hungry', 'are', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'cheer', 'Eddy', 'who', 'been', 'treated', 'being', 'good', 'guy', 'movie', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'smart', 'enough', 'conserve', 'food', 'attempts', 'keep', 'cannibalism', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'overlook', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'unfortunately', 'film', ""n't"", 'mediocre', 'best', 'usually', 'Glover', 'films', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'film', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'not', 'give', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'stars', 'end', 'figured', ""'d"", 'give', 'two', 'managed', 'finish', 'film', 'more', 'think', 'movie', 'less', 'seem', 'like', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'kill', 'hour', 'half', 'recommend', 'looking', 'documentaries', 'out', 'there', 'going', 'movie', 'Alive', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'do', 'true', 'story', 'Donner', 'Party', 'justice', 'shame', 'true', 'story', 'legends', 'surrounding', 'story', 'are', 'fascinating', 'own', 'right']",N/A
1283722,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B002Q9VP7A,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[2, 2]","One of the most harrowing disasters in pioneer history, the Donner Party migration of 1846 to California has resisted film treatment. The dark subject matter involves fate, unimaginable suffering, and cannibalism. It's more than a lurid tale, but if you're going to make a film on this subject, you better have a budget. Rookie writer/director T.J. Martin appears to have barely a dime in his 2009 film ""The Donner Party."" But that doesn't stop him from trekking through the snow with an unknown cast in this straight-to-video release.With the exception of the brilliant 1992 documentaryThe American Experience: The Donner Party, film treatments have been forgettable. There was a 1978 TV filmDonner Pass:Road to Survival [VHS] which madeBest of Bonanza (34 episodes)seem like high art. Walt Disney made the mediocre 1994 TV film ""One More Mountain"" starring Chris Cooper. Even controversial director Roman Polanski was developing a big budget production before the death of his wife Sharon Tate, prompting him to leave Hollywood and drop all projects.So Martin travels a rare path, though with a budget only Roger Corman could love. He attempts to detail a single aspect of the story known as The Forlorn Hope. Trapped in the snowy mountains, desperate pioneers were running out of food and dying. The healthiest 15 men and women fashioned snow shoes and attempted to hike over the pass to notify California residents of their dire situation. Food ran out and they became hopelessly lost. Pummeled with intense blizzards, people died, some were cannibalized and yet somehow, a few emaciated survivors made it to civilization after 33 days. What happened to The Forlorn Hope is a nightmarish and tragic tale.Martin has a great story to work with. But for whatever reason, he changes names, alters events and creates an unnecessary villain. ""The Donner Party"" also has the unforgivable feel of a cheap horror film. Casting Crispin Glover in the role of William Foster is questionable at best, though I must admit he gives an interesting performance. Martin has altered his character into a version of James Reed, a wealthy, semi-leader of the party who was banished months before The Forlorn Hope (and who had already reached California). There's a concocted rivalry between Foster and William Eddy (Clayne Crawford) which is false. Charles Stanton (Christian Kane) initially leads the group with the promise of food provisions, which is also not true. The drawing of straws to decide who would die so others could live was considered, but it did not take place. There's ridiculous dream sequences to fill in dramatic gaps and one important character, who in fact survived The Forlorn Hope, appears to be murdered for revenge. And on we march, liberties taken for no good reason other than a filmmaker's laziness.One of the most unthinkable tragedies of The Forlorn Hope is the fate of Luis and Salvador, two Consumne Native Americans who accompanied the infamous snowshoe party as guides. Once again, Martin alters history by eliminating Salvador, though he does include Luis. If you're inspired by a true story, why change the facts? Otherwise, what's the purpose of making the film? Anyway, Luis's fate in the film is essentially accurate.I can see what Martin was attempting as he details the breakdown of civility and humanity. The overwhelming conditions of starvation slowly forces the group into an ""every man for himself"" dynamic. But the depth of Martin's examination barely achieves the level of a high school play. To Martin's credit, the cannibalism is mostly insinuated and the on-location filming in the Sierra Nevada mountains is effective. But friend, it's all in the details. Healthy, fresh-faced actors emote unconvincing lines of starvation. Period clothes remain dry and wrinkle free. The dramatic flow incoherently stumbles through the hills without suspense. And then it abruptly ends. Yes, it's a mess.To know the truth, readOrdeal by HungerorDesperate Passage: The Donner Party's Perilous Journey Westinstead.",2,It's all in the details...,1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,4033,"['One', 'most', 'harrowing', 'disasters', 'pioneer', 'history', 'Donner', 'Party', 'migration', '1846', 'California', 'resisted', 'film', 'treatment', 'dark', 'subject', 'matter', 'fate', 'unimaginable', 'suffering', 'cannibalism', 'more', 'lurid', 'tale', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'film', 'subject', 'better', 'have', 'budget', 'Rookie', 'writer/director', 'T.J.', 'Martin', 'have', 'barely', 'dime', '2009', 'film', 'Donner', 'Party', ""n't"", 'stop', 'trekking', 'snow', 'unknown', 'cast', 'straight-to-video', 'release.With', 'exception', 'brilliant', '1992', 'documentaryThe', 'American', 'Experience', 'Donner', 'Party', 'film', 'treatments', 'have', 'been', 'forgettable', 'was', '1978', 'TV', 'filmDonner', 'Pass', 'Road', 'Survival', '[', 'VHS', ']', 'madeBest', 'Bonanza', '34', 'episodes', 'seem', 'high', 'art', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'made', 'mediocre', '1994', 'TV', 'film', 'One', 'More', 'Mountain', 'starring', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Even', 'controversial', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'was', 'developing', 'big', 'budget', 'production', 'death', 'wife', 'Sharon', 'Tate', 'prompting', 'leave', 'Hollywood', 'drop', 'projects.So', 'Martin', 'rare', 'path', 'budget', 'only', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'could', 'love', 'detail', 'single', 'aspect', 'story', 'known', 'Forlorn', 'Hope', 'Trapped', 'snowy', 'mountains', 'desperate', 'pioneers', 'were', 'running', 'out', 'food', 'dying', 'healthiest', '15', 'men', 'women', 'fashioned', 'snow', 'shoes', 'attempted', 'hike', 'pass', 'notify', 'California', 'residents', 'dire', 'situation', 'Food', 'ran', 'out', 'became', 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'Pummeled', 'intense', 'blizzards', 'people', 'died', 'were', 'cannibalized', 'yet', 'somehow', 'few', 'emaciated', 'survivors', 'made', 'civilization', '33', 'days', 'What', 'happened', 'Forlorn', 'Hope', 'nightmarish', 'tragic', 'tale.Martin', 'great', 'story', 'work', 'reason', 'names', 'alters', 'events', 'unnecessary', 'villain', 'Donner', 'Party', 'also', 'unforgivable', 'feel', 'cheap', 'horror', 'film', 'Casting', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'role', 'William', 'Foster', 'questionable', 'best', 'must', 'admit', 'interesting', 'performance', 'Martin', 'altered', 'character', 'version', 'James', 'Reed', 'wealthy', 'semi-leader', 'party', 'who', 'was', 'banished', 'months', 'Forlorn', 'Hope', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'reached', 'California', 'concocted', 'rivalry', 'Foster', 'William', 'Eddy', 'Clayne', 'Crawford', 'false', 'Charles', 'Stanton', 'Christian', 'Kane', 'initially', 'group', 'promise', 'food', 'provisions', 'also', 'not', 'true', 'drawing', 'straws', 'decide', 'who', 'would', 'die', 'others', 'could', 'live', 'was', 'considered', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'ridiculous', 'dream', 'sequences', 'fill', 'dramatic', 'gaps', 'one', 'important', 'character', 'who', 'fact', 'survived', 'Forlorn', 'Hope', 'be', 'murdered', 'revenge', 'march', 'taken', 'good', 'reason', 'other', 'filmmaker', 'laziness.One', 'most', 'unthinkable', 'tragedies', 'Forlorn', 'Hope', 'fate', 'Luis', 'Salvador', 'two', 'Consumne', 'Native', 'Americans', 'who', 'accompanied', 'infamous', 'snowshoe', 'party', 'guides', 'Once', 'again', 'Martin', 'alters', 'history', 'eliminating', 'Salvador', 'include', 'Luis', ""'re"", 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'why', 'change', 'facts', 'Otherwise', 'what', 'purpose', 'making', 'film', 'Anyway', 'Luis', 'fate', 'film', 'essentially', 'accurate.I', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'Martin', 'was', 'attempting', 'details', 'breakdown', 'civility', 'humanity', 'overwhelming', 'conditions', 'starvation', 'slowly', 'group', 'man', 'dynamic', 'depth', 'Martin', 'examination', 'barely', 'level', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'Martin', 'credit', 'cannibalism', 'mostly', 'insinuated', 'on-location', 'filming', 'Sierra', 'Nevada', 'effective', 'friend', 'details', 'Healthy', 'fresh-faced', 'actors', 'emote', 'unconvincing', 'lines', 'starvation', 'Period', 'clothes', 'remain', 'dry', 'wrinkle', 'free', 'dramatic', 'flow', 'incoherently', 'hills', 'suspense', 'then', 'abruptly', 'Yes', 'mess.To', 'know', 'truth', 'readOrdeal', 'HungerorDesperate', 'Passage', 'Donner', 'Party', 'Perilous', 'Journey', 'Westinstead']",N/A

Brown""","[12, 15]","The obvious approach for a film about THE DONNER PARTY, one of the most infamous stories of deadly misadventure in American history, would be horror. But in T.J. Martin's THE DONNER PARTY, the historic event gets a well deserved dramatic approach that makes it all the more unsettling. Like most dramatic retellings, the ultimate end is known, but the journey, quite literally in this case, is more important than the end result. Martin's screenplay is a thriller focusing on the psychological ordeal of starvation and extreme weather. Martin takes liberties creating dramatic tension between members of the party, but otherwise the story is painstakingly accurate. Film at the actual Donner Pass in only 12 days, the stark beauty of a seemingly tranquil winter forest is countered with the increasing desperation only those on the brink of survival can feel. Personal conflicts are barely kept in check, and facades slowly start to wear the longer the party goes without provisions. It seems everyone has the eyes of a villain, and is trying to figure out who might turn on the rest. It's an impressive feat considering most of the action is either walking, or sitting around a fire, requiring the actors to emote their desperation with gravitas. The cannibalism is not glorified; everyone conveys a mixture of disgust and desperation in the few scenes where flesh is eaten. While the entire cast does a respectable job, and Crispin Glover is refreshingly cast against type, the standout performance is by Mark Boone, Jr. Boone (BATMAN BEGINS, MEMENTO) is usually typecast as a thug. But in THE DONNER PARTY he is the moral compass of the story, and does it well. In a pivotal moment, with very few words and tight camera work, Boone steals the movie.",4,Well Deserved Dramatic Approach to True Horror,1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,1752,"['obvious', 'approach', 'film', 'THE', 'DONNER', 'PARTY', 'one', 'most', 'infamous', 'stories', 'deadly', 'misadventure', 'American', 'history', 'would', 'be', 'horror', 'T.J.', 'Martin', 'THE', 'DONNER', 'PARTY', 'historic', 'event', 'well', 'deserved', 'dramatic', 'approach', 'more', 'unsettling', 'most', 'dramatic', 'retellings', 'ultimate', 'end', 'known', 'journey', 'quite', 'literally', 'case', 'more', 'important', 'end', 'result', 'Martin', 'screenplay', 'thriller', 'focusing', 'psychological', 'ordeal', 'starvation', 'extreme', 'weather', 'Martin', 'liberties', 'creating', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'members', 'party', 'otherwise', 'story', 'painstakingly', 'accurate', 'Film', 'actual', 'Donner', 'Pass', 'only', '12', 'days', 'stark', 'beauty', 'seemingly', 'tranquil', 'winter', 'forest', 'countered', 'increasing', 'desperation', 'only', 'brink', 'survival', 'can', 'feel', 'Personal', 'conflicts', 'are', 'barely', 'kept', 'check', 'facades', 'slowly', 'start', 'wear', 'longer', 'party', 'provisions', 'everyone', 'eyes', 'villain', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'might', 'turn', 'rest', 'impressive', 'feat', 'considering', 'most', 'action', 'walking', 'sitting', 'fire', 'requiring', 'actors', 'emote', 'desperation', 'gravitas', 'cannibalism', 'not', 'glorified', 'everyone', 'mixture', 'disgust', 'desperation', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'flesh', 'eaten', 'entire', 'cast', 'respectable', 'job', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'refreshingly', 'cast', 'type', 'standout', 'performance', 'Mark', 'Boone', 'Jr.', 'Boone', 'BATMAN', 'BEGINS', 'MEMENTO', 'usually', 'typecast', 'thug', 'THE', 'DONNER', 'PARTY', 'moral', 'compass', 'story', 'well', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'very', 'few', 'words', 'tight', 'camera', 'work', 'Boone', 'movie']",N/A

1283729,A1DPCXO7RDZM0S,B002Q9VP7A,Mick McAllister,"[24, 26]","It's hard to come up with a single positive thing to say about this miserable, nasty film. It was shot at Truckee (Donner) Lake, but the photography is so mediocre that even this doesn't count for much.As for the story: It doesn't merely ""stray from the historical record,"" it invents malicious lies about people who deserve better. As one of many examples: In the film, Bill Eddy is depicted as a selfish hoarder who refuses to share with the rest of the suffering families. In fact, the opposite was true. Eddy's entire family died, in part because he foolishly shared food with people who, when the time came, did not reciprocate. Never mind that none -- not a meager few, but NONE, not even the least friendly -- of the historical records agree with this bizarre assassination of Eddy's character. Eddy is depicted as the paid leader of the party, when in fact his was merely one small family among nearly a dozen. This would not be significant, except that ""Mr. Foster"" (who is depicted as the financial and spiritual leader of ""the Donner Party"" for reasons never explained) berates Eddy for taking money to lead them and then causing the disaster of their entrapment in the Sierras.Foster, of course, was a minor player, a son-in-law of one of the older women, not the central figure of the group. The film goes on at great length about Eddy's refusal to share a cabin with the ""Fosters"" (actually the Murphys) when in fact Eddy DID share a cabin with them. But that's only the beginning, as far as twisting the facts is concerned. The Donners, the Reeds, and the Breens, making up 70% of the camp population and the real leadership, are simply not present in the film (except for one reference to the ""30 people"" left behind at ""the Donner camp""). Will McCutcheon and Milt Elliot (two singularly different people) get conflated into one character, and then killed off in his first scene. Eddy finally makes it to help by abandoning the rest, who end up killing each other in a squabble.So it's fiction, tricked out with historical names for no discernible reason. As fiction, it doesn't fare much better than as history. The viewer is faced with some problems that didn't need to be there. First, the cobbled-up ""cabins"" that we see from the outside (one appears to be bedsheets on a clothesline), turn out to have interiors that would have been spacious living quarters in the era, complete with tables, lamps, and dinnerware. Second, in the spirit of casting perversity, the characters are all plump, round-faced, and obviously well-fed (and at least three of the men appear to have made their careers on the strength of their resemblance to William Peterson), so the jawing about hunger is no more convincing than Mrs. Quayle's appeal to her missing lunch. For reasons no one explains, the ""Forlorn Hope"" carries the snowshoes they made so laboriously instead of wearing them; no, I did not make that up. There is one brief scene, a few seconds long, around the middle of the hour-long depiction of the trek, in which they wear them. However, they do frequently use them as walking sticks. And the ""handmade"" snowshoes, by the way, are beautifully crafted top-of-the-line REI specials.Of course, the ""money shot"" in the story is the cannibalism (which is, frankly, the least interesting element of the real story of the Donner Party), and they even manage to botch that. The moment they run out of food, someone says, ""Well, I guess we'll have to eat each other,"" and they immediately begin working out the details. The tone is almost, ""Well, I'M not missing lunch!!"" Suffice it to say that the details end up being a brave soul marching out into the snow so another brave soul can shoot him. Then a character who borders on obese (who cast this thing?) kills himself to add to the ham stock. By the time they get to ""Sutter Fort"" (they can't even get that right), they have killed four members of the party and chewed on some chunks of what looks like thawed chicken breast. We should be grateful, probably, that the producers couldn't afford ""special effects.""Watching this film, with its dopey, stilted dialog (everyone refers to everyone as ""Mr."" and ""Mrs."", even while chowing down on the addressee's spouse), its bizarre culture fantasies (on at least three occasions, husbands put their uppity wives in their place, once with the threat of a backhand, and the group spends as much time praying as they do marching), the cheesy cost-cutting (there is no blizzard, and the snow is at most a few feet deep), and its garish insincerity (much is made of the common humanity of the Indian ""Louis,"" but the actor playing him is not listed in the credits!), I have to think that ""straight to disc"" is too good for it.
