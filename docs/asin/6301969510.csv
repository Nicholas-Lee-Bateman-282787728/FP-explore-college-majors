The opening scenes talk about the ""wily Pathan"" as if to show attitudes out of date and lacking reality. [Is it funny? Perhaps it's a cultural thing.] A truck hits a mine. The talk goes on for a need to fill up time. Filmed scenes of Dunkirk are inserted to contrast with the film. The comedy goes on with various stunts. ""When will it ever end?"" So the film runs on with more of the same. Whose biplane was shot down? After a while there are more scenes then the babbling colonel again. Can they capture land for a cricket pitch? Can anything save this film?After a while they seem to be in Europe not North Africa. A prop wooden frame house is demolished. ""I knew this would happen."" Inane conversations continue.

281121,A14XW8BJGEBM91,6301969510,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[2, 2]","To most film lovers, Beatle extraordinaire John Lennon is probably best known for the movies that he made with the Beatles, such as ""A Hard Day's Night"" (1964) and ""Help"" (1965), both directed by Richard Lester. But Lennon also starred in another Lester film, ""How I Won the War,"" which originally was not a critical success, but with time has deservedly become an anti-war comedy classic. And this treasure is finally available on DVD, a true movie collector's dream.The film's main star is Michael Crawford, a respected English actor, who sadly is mostly known in the United States for his role of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" but whom I fondly remember from ""The Games"" (1970). In ""How I Won the War,"" he plays Lt. Earnest Goodbody, a truly incompetent officer who commands one of the worst units in the British army. It begins in the Rhine, Germany, in 1945, when Goodbody is captured by the Germans. From there, it goes back and forth between his days in the battlefield to conversations with his German captor. We witness when he is recruited by an officer that tells him, ""Funny things happen when the killing starts. Some don't like it. That's when you come in..."" He is given a mission that takes him to Tunisia, where he is sent with his brigade of musketeers. One of his soldiers happens to be the sarcastic Gripweed (John Lennon), who, like his partners, feels uncomfortable with Goodbody's inept command. In particular, I enjoyed Lee Montague as Sergeant Transom, an experienced officer also under Goodbody's command, who pretty much keeps them alive. We follow the musketeers, as they are killed one by one, some in the most silly of circumstances. We also meet a high commanding officer, who reminded me of Col. Kilgore in ""Apocalypse Now,"" who tells Goodbody that ""fascism is something you grow out of."" In the end, Goodbody learns that ""what is wrong with the army in general, is that there is not enough humanity in it."" Oddly enough, most of these situations are hilarious.""How I Won the War"" is a mix of many things: comedy, drama, and even surreal. Lester's use of color is fascinating and refreshing. There are also scenes of actual war footage, which Lester uses for dramatic purposes. The film has been compared to Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and I agree that it probably belongs to the same league. They are both complex and at times hard to follow, but they truly deliver. Perhaps, one of the most anti-war messages in the movie is when a soldier is told, ""You'll be fighting in a war that may well turn out to be a crusade."" This was in 1967, and it may sound familiar to some today. (UK, 1976, color, 111 min).

281122,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6301969510,Deborah Earle,"[3, 3]","Under Richard Lester's direction, Patrick Ryan's ""How I Won the War"", which he wrote with Ernest Goodbody(portrayed  by a lean, freckled, and witless young Michael Crawford)is brought to the big screen.Not having read the book on which the darkly comic film was based, I will note that the film stands on its own as a notable feature of the British anti-war film genre, during which an artistic community depict the very war which imperiled them during their earliest years of life as a device to express their objection to U.S. involvment in Vietnam.Inevitably the war depicted in the film, and the time of its release play key factors in the significance of this film, and given that the same destruction of life, families, and property take place in all wars, the film still has much relavance now.In flashbacks, fantasy sequences, actual footage of World War II campaigns, and via Goodbody's stint in a German P.O.W. camp where he converses with the German officer, Odlebog(Karl Michael Vogler), we learn of his ordeal, and that of the ill-fated unit serving under him, including Gripweed(Beatle John Lennon, who though in reality going against military regulations, manages to keep a bit of his trademark shag hairdo), Clapper(Roy Kinnear)who worries about his wife's (Fanny Carby) infidelity, Juniper(Jack MacGowran), Transom (Lee Montague), and the non-compliant Melancholy Musketeer(Jack Hedley).The objective of this unit --the 3rd Troop, the 4th Musketeers of a fictional regiment, is to set up an ""Advanced Area Cricket Pitch"" behind enemy lines in Tunisia. In fact, we catch our first glimpse of  most of the principals on a lovely English cricket field before they go into uniform.Goodbody is under the command of officer Grapple (Michael Hordern). In a scene where he takes his place in a trench before an entrance way with a triple 13 over it, we have our first omen of the dreadful situation at hand, and Goodbody's not having gone much further than Grammar School in a key factor in the disaster that is to come.We periodically glimpse the homefront, but spend much time following these men through the desert of North Africa to the theme song from ""Lawrence of Arabia"".At one point they accidently shoot down an Allied plane, The Melancholy Musketeer is confronted for hiding when he should be performing his duties, and a series of events during which Goodbody proves to be an inept leader cost him one man after another. But their differently colored ghosts, dressed in World War I uniforms complete with puttees and pan-shaped helmets, return to perform their duties in silence.A scene of a bullet-ridden and felled John Lennon in a German field, facing a camera, and saying, ""You knew what was going to happen to me, didn't you?"" would develop more ominous tones some thirteen years after this film's release.Along for this misadventure (which Goodbody is too blind to view as such) are Ronald Lacey's Spool, James Cossin's Drogue, Alexander Knox as and American General, Robert Hardy as a British General, Bill Dysart as a paratrooper, and many others.It all ends with a haunting reunion whose moral a contemporary audience of Vietnam War protesters could appreciate upon the revelation that one officer's so-called cowardly behavior resulted in his being the only other man in attendance.While the absurdist style and skipping back and forth can make it difficult to watch, ""How I Won the War"" serves as a warning against the jingoism, megalomania, and arrogance of incompetent leaders in all areas of life.",5,Formidable Epitome of the '60s British Antiwar Film Genre,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,3531,"['Richard', 'Lester', 'direction', 'Patrick', 'Ryan', 'How', 'Won', 'War', 'wrote', 'Ernest', 'Goodbody', 'portrayed', 'lean', 'freckled', 'witless', 'young', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'brought', 'big', 'screen.Not', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'darkly', 'comic', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'will', 'note', 'film', 'own', 'notable', 'feature', 'British', 'anti-war', 'film', 'genre', 'artistic', 'community', 'depict', 'very', 'war', 'imperiled', 'earliest', 'years', 'life', 'device', 'express', 'objection', 'U.S.', 'involvment', 'Vietnam.Inevitably', 'war', 'depicted', 'film', 'time', 'release', 'play', 'key', 'factors', 'significance', 'film', 'given', 'same', 'destruction', 'life', 'families', 'property', 'take', 'place', 'wars', 'film', 'still', 'much', 'relavance', 'now.In', 'flashbacks', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'actual', 'footage', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'campaigns', 'Goodbody', 'stint', 'German', 'P.O.W', 'camp', 'where', 'German', 'officer', 'Odlebog', 'Karl', 'Michael', 'Vogler', 'learn', 'ordeal', 'ill-fated', 'unit', 'serving', 'including', 'Gripweed', 'Beatle', 'John', 'Lennon', 'who', 'reality', 'going', 'military', 'regulations', 'keep', 'bit', 'trademark', 'shag', 'hairdo', 'Clapper', 'Roy', 'Kinnear', 'who', 'wife', 'Fanny', 'Carby', 'infidelity', 'Juniper', 'Jack', 'MacGowran', 'Transom', 'Lee', 'Montague', 'non-compliant', 'Melancholy', 'Musketeer', 'Jack', 'Hedley', '.The', 'objective', 'unit', '3rd', 'Troop', '4th', 'Musketeers', 'fictional', 'regiment', 'set', 'up', 'Advanced', 'Area', 'Cricket', 'Pitch', 'enemy', 'lines', 'Tunisia', 'fact', 'catch', 'first', 'glimpse', 'most', 'principals', 'lovely', 'English', 'cricket', 'field', 'go', 'uniform.Goodbody', 'command', 'officer', 'Grapple', 'Michael', 'Hordern', 'scene', 'where', 'place', 'trench', 'entrance', 'way', 'triple', '13', 'have', 'first', 'omen', 'dreadful', 'situation', 'hand', 'Goodbody', 'not', 'having', 'gone', 'much', 'further', 'Grammar', 'School', 'key', 'factor', 'disaster', 'come.We', 'periodically', 'glimpse', 'homefront', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'following', 'men', 'desert', 'North', 'Africa', 'theme', 'song', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'one', 'point', 'accidently', 'shoot', 'down', 'Allied', 'plane', 'Melancholy', 'Musketeer', 'confronted', 'hiding', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'performing', 'duties', 'series', 'events', 'Goodbody', 'be', 'inept', 'leader', 'cost', 'one', 'man', 'differently', 'colored', 'ghosts', 'dressed', 'World', 'War', 'uniforms', 'complete', 'puttees', 'pan-shaped', 'helmets', 'return', 'perform', 'duties', 'silence.A', 'scene', 'bullet-ridden', 'felled', 'John', 'Lennon', 'German', 'field', 'facing', 'camera', 'saying', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', 'develop', 'more', 'ominous', 'tones', 'thirteen', 'years', 'film', 'release.Along', 'misadventure', 'Goodbody', 'too', 'blind', 'view', 'such', 'are', 'Ronald', 'Lacey', 'Spool', 'James', 'Cossin', 'Drogue', 'Alexander', 'Knox', 'American', 'General', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'British', 'General', 'Bill', 'Dysart', 'paratrooper', 'many', 'others.It', 'ends', 'haunting', 'reunion', 'moral', 'contemporary', 'audience', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'protesters', 'could', 'appreciate', 'revelation', 'one', 'officer', 'so-called', 'cowardly', 'behavior', 'resulted', 'being', 'only', 'other', 'man', 'absurdist', 'style', 'skipping', 'back', 'forth', 'can', 'make', 'difficult', 'watch', 'How', 'Won', 'War', 'warning', 'jingoism', 'megalomania', 'arrogance', 'incompetent', 'leaders', 'areas', 'life']",N/A

281124,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6301969510,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 5]","As the Vietnam War was looming and more people around the world continued to protest, Patrick Ryan would write a novel titled ""How I Won the War"" and it was later received a film adaptation by Charles Wood, known for his work in 1965 for the Beatles film titled ""Help!"" and a film directed by Richard Lester, known for directing Beatles films ""Help!"" and ""A Hard Day's Night"", including the the second and third ""Superman"" films.But back in 1967, Patrick Ryan's screenplay would be much different compared to the novel as the novel featured different infantry units which featured campaigns in Italy and Greece.  But despite the differences, both would have a similarity in the fact that the film would focus on the pointlessness of war.While the film was not exactly critically well-received, part of the allure of the film is the fact that Beatles star John Lennon appeared in a non-Beatles film and it would be the first film to showcase Lennon with short-hair and what would become his trademark eyeglasses (which the music artist would where from here on in...) and it has been rumored that while on the set, Lennon wrote ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".""How I Won the War"" is a black comedy that takes place during World War II and focuses on main character Lt. Goodbody (played by Michael Crawford), an ultimately inept leader who not only is idealistic but also naive. The film begins as the Lt. leads his troops and in a moment, we see one of his own soldiers aiming a rifle at him, knowing they can take out their leader.  But doesn't go through with it.Eventually Lt. Goodbody is captured by the Nazi's and as he is about to be killed, Goodbody begins telling the Nazi soldier his story and begins saying that ""war is the noblest of games"" while he and his soldiers are playing a game of cricket and thinking that his soldiers look up to him, while the soldiers turn to the camera and say how they really feel about their leader.When Goodbody goes to Egypt, he is given a mission from another person in command.  As he knows that Goodbody wants to prove himself a leader, so he assigns Lt. Goodbody to lead a group of musketeers to North Africa but instead of participating in the invasion, he has three days to create a cricket pitch in the middle of nowhere.As Lt. Goodbody wants to show his true worth, he will do whatever it takes to make this cricket pitch, and despite being educationally trained, it doesn't make him a great leader on the battlefield and throughout the film, it's because of Goodbody making inept decisions, the members of the platoon eventually meet their demise.""How I Won the War"" is released on the anniversary of John and Yoko Ono's highly publicized ""Bed-In"" protesting the Vietnam War and John and Yoko's wedding.  The DVD under the supervision of Richard Lester has been fully remastered.VIDEO & AUDIO:""How I Won the War"" is presented in widescreen and audio via Dolby Digital. Under the supervision of director Richard Lester, the DVD has been fully remastered.  With that being said, the film does start off with the message that the film has been manufactured using the best source material available.While ""How I Won the War"" looks very good for its age, the film does have its share of dust and speckles and some haloing as well at the edges and tehre are some lines that show from time to time which leads me to believe that the original film elements had some damage.  But for the most part, the film does look good and I can only wonder if this film was remastered in HD for a Blu-ray release, how much better this film would look in high definition.Audio is clear and understandable but it is pretty much a front channel-driven film.  Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:There are no special features on the ""How I Won the War"" DVD.EXTRAS:It's important to note that for a limited time, a special edition commemorative booklet is included with each purchase of ""How I Won the War"" and features behind-the-scenes stills from the film.JUDGMENT CALL:""How I Won the War"" may have not been a critically-praised film by the critics during its time and for Beatles fans, to see John Lennon in a film so different from ""Help!"" and ""A Hard Days Night"" didn't help matters all that much.  One thing that I learned during my research of this film is how, back in 1967, many film critics kept comparing ""How I Won the War"" to ""Catch-22', although they do mention how this film is more British in subject and tone.Fast forward nearly 45-years later and some situations just don't change and the black comedy of this film can easily be seen as timely and appropriate for what the world has been experiencing as of late.  Especially here in the United States.The film focuses on World War II and focuses on a British military unit.  While many WWII films focuses on the fight against the Japanese and the Germans, in the case of these British soldiers, they aren't defending anything, nor are they bombing anything.  They have been sent to North Africa to build a cricket pitch by their superiors and as the soldiers are forced to do this, we see how the soldiers begin to die and each time one is killed (and even when alive), they address the screen with an a message to the audience about their feeling of the war.Michael Crawford plays the inept British World War II commander Lt. Earnest Goodbody and features John Lennon as the pessimist Musketeer Gripweed, Jack MacGowran as Musketeer Juniper, Roy Kinnear as the realist, Musketeer Clapper and Lee Montague as Sergeant Transom who are under his command.  And as each member of his platoon is lost, Goodbody shows no compassion towards the lives lost and just cares about him ""winning"" the war by his way, his decisions.The film showcases a collage of surreal and hilarious battle footage and one-liners lampooning the absurdity of war.  In many ways, I would love to discuss more about the absurdities but to do so would spoil some of those memorable scenes from the film.While the black comedy does have its share of hilarious and absurd scenes, the question is if the comedy is done well.  As mentioned, this film is constantly compared to other anti-war films and whether or not it is successful has depended on its viewer.  In this case, your mileage may vary, on how the jokes appeal to you.  Jokes that are intriguing and hilarious or jokes that fall flat, it all depends on the viewer.Aside from the black comedy, director Richard Lester tries to experimental ways of showcasing death by using dead soldiers painted in bright colors (with painted pantyhose over their faces).  Lester along with cinematographer David Watkin utilizes various filters and archived WWII footage to showcase the danger of war as we see dead bodies scattered all over the place, crushed by tanks or floating in the sea.Overall, I have no doubt in my mind that how this film was received back in 1967, will be the same today.  While there are people who believe that war is necessary for the greater good and to protect other countries, others will also feel that war is unnecessary and no war has brought long-standing peace. No doubt that people will love and hate this film.This is not a movie that showcases heroic motivations for war, nor is it a movie about the Vietnam War, in fact, it's a bold film that makes a statement on how WAR (in general) is utterly absurd.  How its leaders, in this case, Michael Crawford as British World War II, is young, patriotic and wants to be rewarded for his inept decisions but at what cost?  Because of his leadership, many people have died under him and in the end, does he learn his lesson?In the end, ""How I Won the War"" may not be for everyone, but if you are feeling that there is no point of war and are open to watching films with an anti-war message, then you may find the black comedy of ""How I Won the War"" to be to your liking.",3,An interesting anti-war film showing the viewer the absurdity of war...It may not be for everyone...,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,7861,"['Vietnam', 'War', 'was', 'looming', 'more', 'people', 'world', 'continued', 'protest', 'Patrick',

That same year he also co-starred with Michael Crawford in the film ""How I Won the War"", based on the book of the same name. It's a comedy of sorts. Don't think it works as well, as it's a bit rapid fire with a fragmented and out-of-order plot, but I do think it holds together better than, say, the ""Magical Mystery Tour"" film.An enthusiastic grammar school fellow named Goodbody (Michael Crawford) has joined the British army, has been appointed Corporal, and given a troop of men to lead against the Germans, including a certain Liverpool lad by the name of Gripweed (John Lennon), a young man who can go from being happy-go-lucky to rather intimidating, given the situation. Goodbody's platoon troop across the sands of Spain, while encountering mutiny, mines and madness along the way. How did Goodbody win the war?The answer, though it makes a point, didn't really grab me that much. Kind of goes for the rest of the film, actually. There's too much satire in it to be a light hearted sillyness, yet the constant sillyness takes the punch out of the satire. It's not that there isn't some thoughtful stuff in the guise of sillyness, there's definitely a few lines that really got me thinking, but like I said, it's pretty rapid fire, so it's hard to make sense of what is happening. There was something going on between Goodbody and his platoon, some sort of relationship that was significant, but I couldn't tell you what it was exactly. Don't think it was a good relationship though. John Lennon played an interesting character, I think, a bit geekier than you'd expect him to be. He doesn't get a whole stack of lines, though. It's interesting seeing a younger Michael Crawford too, and I thought the Spanish location was pretty cool.If you're after some 1960s sillyness with a Beatle, check out ""The Magic Christian"" instead, starring Peter Sellers and Ringo. ""How I Won The War"" takes a bit more patience and concentration. It's not neccesarily a bad film, it's just pretty difficult.

Michael Crawford is the main character of this film. It is Crawford that undergoes a transition in this film from his military experience and he is the central focus of all the bizarre events that occur.

281128,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,6301969510,Kevin R. Austra,"[7, 17]","Bizarre is too kind a word for this film.  Director and Producer Richard Lester made a significant jump from the Beatles ""HELP"" to this over ambitious and dark military satire that makes ""Catch 22"" appear sane.  Michael Crawford shares billing with John Lennon, but Lennon offers little more than an extended cameo appearance with a few glib remarks.  There are appearances by a few other Lester ""Regulars"" including Roy Kinnear in this film.The picture is loaded with flash-forwards, flashbacks, and often intercut with black and white footage from unrelated military movies.  Even the soundtrack from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" finds its way into two scenes.  You have to listen carefully to catch the fast-paced irreverent dialogue.  There is a short B&W; battle scene toward the end of the movie that would have had potential for a decent war film.  As an oddity from the second half of the 1960's the film is worth watching, but you are better off renting it first.As a war film, this is not something you should rush out to add to your military film collection.  Even oddball military comedies such as CATCH 22, KELLY'S HEROES, and M*A*S*H are closer to the mark than Lester's work.  As a Beatles fan, I added this film to my collection because of John Lennon's presence.

I was about 13 when I stayed up until about 5am watching this movie on cable, and, for one thing, being exhausted really adds an element to it, but I think that people who are disappointed in it because they were expecting something different are missing the point.  I though the movie was a brilliant farce and is one of the greatest British comedies ever.  Keep in mind that British comics have very little compuction about what they do.  I thought that Lennon's performance was very natural and irreverent, just as it was in A Hard Days' Night and Help! and I certainly wasn't disappointed in it in the least.  Crawford was surprisingly thin, but also gave a great performance.  The movie is just meant to be a weird, eye-opening experience and one must approach it from that angle.  Granted, it isn't for everyone, but all the people whom I've shown the movie loved it and got a copy for themselves.

The book is a hilarious story of a bumbling, Clouseau-esque British military commander (I forget his rank) and his misadventures in World War II, told in a series of episodes.  The book's humor derives from the absurd situations (in one chapter, the British and Germans fight ""The Battle of the Booze,"" attempting to loot high-quality wine from an Italian village) as well as the commander's inability to perceive his troops' contempt for him, not to mention his failure to perceive his own idiocy.  There is nothing specifically anti-war in the book, it's just a funny book set in war-time.  Given the time and circumstances of the movie version (Vietnam war, hip young director, and participating Beatle), it's not surprising that Lester tried to inject a strong anti-war sentiment. In a daring move, amidst the (attempted) comedy, there are graphic scenes of wounded, as in M.A.S.H.  However, unlike M.A.S.H., there's nothing really funny in the movie.  Almost every humorous episode from the book is cut out.  Instead, in Lester's attempt to make a statement about the nonsense of war, you get a lot of nonsense on the screen.  Lester's attempts to be cutting-edge in his direction seem way too self-conscious and smugly sardonic.  At one point, you see two old ladies watching the movie in a theater and commenting on it, like a bad Monty Python skit.  Also, if you're American, the dialogue is so thickly British, it's incomprehensible at times.  I guess you could, as one reviewer suggested, use headphones, but I suspect that it would hardly be worth it, as this movie is so disappointing otherwise.  I have a strong suspicion that the people who give this movie high ratings just want it to be good, since it's a Lester movie with John Lennon in it.  I frankly cannot recommend it to a fan of either Lester or the Beatles.  However, I highly recommend Lester's ""The Knack and how to get it,"" which is only available on VHS at the present, so far as I know.",2,Another disappointed Lester/Beatles fan,1020038400,"04 29, 2002",2002,2113,"['First', 'have', 'say', 'review', 'colored', 'fact', 'read', 'book', 'apparently', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'print', 'first', 'book', 'hilarious', 'story', 'bumbling', 'Clouseau-esque', 'British', 'military', 'commander', 'forget', 'rank', 'misadventures', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'told', 'series', 'episodes', 'book', 'humor', 'absurd', 'situations', 'one', 'chapter', 'British', 'Germans', 'fight', 'Battle', 'Booze', 'attempting', 'loot', 'high-quality', 'wine', 'Italian', 'village', 'as', 'well', 'commander', 'inability', 'perceive', 'troops', 'contempt', 'not', 'mention', 'failure', 'perceive', 'own', 'idiocy', 'nothing', 'specifically', 'anti-war', 'book', 'just', 'funny', 'book', 'set', 'war-time', 'Given', 'time', 'circumstances', 'movie', 'version', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'hip', 'young', 'director', 'participating', 'Beatle', 'not', 'surprising', 'Lester', 'tried', 'inject', 'strong', 'anti-war', 'sentiment', 'daring', 'move', 'attempted', 'comedy', 'are', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'wounded', 'M.A.S.H', 'However', 'M.A.S.H.', 'nothing', 'really', 'funny', 'movie', 'humorous', 'episode', 'book', 'cut', 'out', 'Instead', 'Lester', 'attempt', 'make', 'statement', 'nonsense', 'war', 'get', 'lot', 'nonsense', 'screen', 'Lester', 'attempts', 'be', 'cutting-edge', 'direction', 'seem', 'way', 'too', 'self-conscious', 'smugly', 'sardonic', 'one', 'point', 'see', 'two', 'old', 'ladies', 'watching', 'movie', 'theater', 'commenting', 'bad', 'Monty', 'Python', 'skit', 'Also', ""'re"", 'American', 'dialogue', 'so', 'thickly', 'British', 'incomprehensible', 'times', 'guess', 'could', 'one', 'reviewer', 'suggested', 'use', 'headphones', 'suspect', 'would', 'hardly', 'be', 'movie', 'so', 'disappointing', 'otherwise', 'have', 'strong', 'suspicion', 'people', 'who', 'give', 'movie', 'high', 'ratings', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'good', 'Lester', 'movie', 'John', 'Lennon', 'frankly', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'fan', 'Lester', 'Beatles', 'However', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Lester', 'Knack', 'how', 'get', 'only', 'available', 'VHS', 'present', 'so', 'far', 'know']",N/A

Director Richard Lester dismounts the british establisment, the cynical lies and fabricated interests hidden under the smoke curtain of the patrotism, the military discipline, the stereotypes of epics and the delirious glorification and manipulative vision that some films do of war with his juvenile and iconoclast spirit and sardonic comicity. Lester uses techniques of strangeness to accentuate the grotesque side of war and the sentiment of alienation in which seems to move all the time the characters: the movie is conceived as a long chain of satirical vignettes whithin a flashback narration conducted by the leutenant Goodbody ( a splendid Michael Crawford ), responsible of one of the worst units of the army. Likewise, the frenetic dialogues are recordered in a very deliberated artificial way provoking the effect as if we were listening the thoughts of the characters or their words didn't belong to them ( this very interesting narrative resort we can already find with a similar intention in the Fleischer brothers' "" talkartoons ""  ).

281136,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6301969510,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 2]","Richard Lester's war satire ""How I Won The War"" is, unfortunately, most famous for John Lennon's only solo performance as an actor in a film. That's too bad because Lester's film which chronicles World War II as seen from the eyes of the often inept aptly named Lt. Ernest Goodbody (Michael Crawford)is quite a good one. Told by Goodbody as he is being held prisoner by the Germans, it's a miracle that anyone UNDER his command survived given his inability and, dare I say it, jingoistic attitude.As much a broader satire of war as it was about the Vietnam War, Lester's film may lack some of the inherent charm of some of his other films (""The Three Musketeers"", ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""Help!"", ""Petulia"", ""Robin and Marian"")but the film still holds up remarkably well. Making a satire on a dire subject like war or the end of the world requires not just the right attitude but the right skills to mix comedic insanity with a dry sensibility (""Dr. Strangelove""). ""How I Won the War"" misses as often as it hits its target but when it is on target it's very witty.The film looks extremely good in its latest DVD incarnation which is from a newly remastered transfer supervised by Richard Lester himself. My only complaint is that this really should have been issued on a regular DVD not a DVD-R. While the quality is high for this particularly DVD-R they tend not to stand up to wear and tear or last as long as regular DVDs. If like me you don't want to shell out (pardon the pun)again for this release, you may want to search out the previous release (although the transfer wasn't quite as good from what I recall)which was released on a regular DVD.The disc comes with the theatrical trailer for the film and some people received a commemerative book with behind-the-scenes photos. Perhaps that's an amazon exclusive because my edition did not feature the book either that or the retailer I ordered it from forgot to include it.""How I Won The War"" will be of interest to fans of Lester's other films and Beatles fans for Lennon's solo acting appearence (although he is just a supporting player despite having him on the cover of the box).
