Simon Drake is actually an excellent magician, some of the stuff is corny, but its meant to be that way, because its funny. However seeing maiden play then seeing drake perform tricks doesnt quite fit, so I think that is one reason why alot of people dislike Simon, really its the God's honest truth. After watching the video the first few times I enjoyed watching him perform along in the video, but about after the 3rd, I got sick of it, and ended up fast fowarding it, it was just a combination that didnt work, now seeing this live at that time would have been killer though.Now for the maiden boys, I know in a sense this had to be sad for them because it was the last show with Bruce, even though their facial expressions say otherwise, all acting happy and excited, and you'd really have to be to play maiden music anyway. Each member does a fine job though really, Bruce sings and gives what he has left, being his last vocal performance I thought he did one hell of a job, since he was already with the band for 12 years, it had to be hard just to leave like that. But he wanted to do his own thing and everything, and he did well at the time. Steve pounds his bass away and does a perfect job, my opinion as a percussionist I think he is the most extraordinary bassist in the world period, just watch him play. No matter what kind of mood he is in, he will always play perfectly. Dave is in top form, and dreds the hell out of the guitar, but his guitar was much louder then Gers, still did a hell of a job. Nicko as always does amazing with the drums, pounds them away, and doesnt hold a grudge one bit. Now for Gers, I love Gers and will always defend him for being considered a horrible guitarist or even not very good, he is awesome really, but this was definitely his worse playing. He does an ok job to count, some songs he does great with: Trooper, Eternity, Hallowed, Heaven, Evil and a few others. But songs like Be quick or be dead, Bring your daughter to the slaughter and fear of the dark, his solos could have been better like they usually are. He can jump around when playing, but he overdoes it a bit on this vid and doesnt play these solos that great, his guitar also needed to be on the same level as Murray. Like I said it is exceptable and he doesnt normally play this bad, really he doesnt, I just think he took it hard when Bruce left too.The vid is good though and every maiden fan should add it to their collection, I think the departure of Bruce could've been better, more real then fake, I thought it was cool how they took him to an Iron Maiden and decapitaed him, but I still thought it wouldve been even better if it had a more realistic departure for the greatest band ever, but im glad hes back with them.

548354,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00004RETH,trebe,"[5, 5]","Not strictly a concert video, Iron Maiden's ""Raising Hell"" combines a live concert with a theatrical show.  Interspersed between the heavy metal barrage that is Iron Maiden, are theatrical productions and magic tricks, with a ""horror"" theme.  These interludes, performed by illusionist Simon Drake, do get a bit gory at times, and break up the continuity of a ""normal"" concert.  This style of presentation may not appeal to everyone.The performance taped in 1993 at Pinewood Studios in London, features Bruce Dickinson, Steve Harris, Dave Murray, Nicko McBrain and Janick Gers, performing material up to the ""Fear Of The Dark"" release.  This was apparently Bruce's last performance with Maiden in the 90's, before splitting, at least temporarily, for a solo career.  Unfortunately, the quality of sound mix is uneven, and on some songs, Dickinson's vocals can barely be made out over the sound of the guitars.  One wonders how this could have happened.  As this is his final performance, Bruce doesn't save his voice when singing a number like ""The Trooper"".  The trouble is we can't always hear him.  The guitar sound is cranked up right in front, and Harris's bass and McBrain's drums are also overpowered at times in the mix.  Overall the video presentation is not bad, we do get to see the band from various angles, but it could have been better.  We see too much of the audience, especially on some of the shots of the front of the stage, the angle is low and the heads and upraised arms of the members of the audience fill the bottom of the screen.The song selection is a good mix of newer songs and classic favorites.  As expected songs from the most recent release are prominent.  ""Be Quick Or Be Dead"", ""Fear of the Dark"" and ""Afraid to Shoot Strangers"" are welcome additions to the set which includes staples like ""Hallowed Be Thy Name"", ""Wrathchild"" and ""Iron Maiden"".  Also included are songs from the later Adrian Smith period, ""The Evil That Men Do"", ""Heaven Can Wait"" and ""The Clairvoyant"".  A nice blend of songs from the band's entire history.This is also an opportunity to see ""new"" guitarist Janick Gers, who is definitely more active on stage than Adrian Smith.  He has the material down and has no problems with the harmony guitar parts.  On some songs he show himself capable of a pretty good imitation of Smith's original solos.  His own soloing style is less melodic and relies more on speed and flash.No one plays guitar like Dave Murray.  His trill filled soloing style is unique, and has become a signature of the Iron Maiden sound.  The man is outstanding here, as his fingers blaze across the fretboard like lightning.  He appears a more confident musician than in the past, with more of a stage presence than before.  Very nice to see him step forward this way.  In the mix, his solos always seem louder than Janick's.While the presentation may not be to everyone's liking, and the sound mix could have certainly been better, ""Raising Hell"" does have its good points.  Bruce and the boys do give an energetic performance.  Iron Maiden are one of the pioneers of British metal, and you get some of their best songs in the DVD format.  Both Bruce Dickinson, and Adrian Smith have since rejoined Maiden, and a DVD release of concert material is supposed to be forthcoming.
