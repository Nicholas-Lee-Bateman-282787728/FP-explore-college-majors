Have become so tired of the typical musical format and the attempt to unfold the struggles of the presidency and the political firestorm over states rights was a welcome treat.  I found the costumes, sets, dialogue, and exposition of then current trends (i.e. bundling?) to be most impressive.

311110,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6302413532,JGC,"[1, 1]","""The Gorgeous Hussy"" starts out with detailed opening credits with pictures of the stars as well as their characters' names displayed. This was common for big-budget MGM pictures such as this one. So it's no coincidence that ""The Gorgeous Hussy"" was one of Joan's biggest MGM productions of her entire 18 year career with the studio. It's an epic history-driven picture, that although is not factually accurate, does borrow heavily on the past.First of all I have to say that Joan looks amazing in this picture. We finally get to see her with long hair. And I love those petticoats and long dresses that she wore because Joan wore them very well. Her classical and timeless beauty was a perfect compliment to these period ensembles.Besides Joan's performance as Peggy, I especially enjoyed the performance of Robert Taylor (as Bow.) He was one good-looking man and so charming and gallant. The movie also includes a large supporting cast with some of the biggest stars of their time, including: Mr. Lionel Barrymore, Melvyn Douglas and the one and only Jimmy Stewart.There are also some funny and comical scenes throughout the picture that I enjoyed as well. I strongly suspect that Joan was able to borrow heavily on her talents as a silent actress in this film by using her body language to convey a million different emotions.""The Gorgeous Hussy"" is somewhat flat and dry in some scenes. The political dialog and the scenes in the senate come to mind. The movie is over 100 minutes long which for its time was considred very long, so that may have something to do with the fact that it did drag on slightly.Nevertheless, this is an interesting movie that any film fan of the Golden Era should watch.",3,when it comes to love you want a man with a slow hand,1258675200,"11 20, 2009",2009,1702,"['Gorgeous', 'Hussy', 'out', 'detailed', 'opening', 'credits', 'pictures', 'stars', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'names', 'displayed', 'was', 'common', 'big-budget', 'MGM', 'pictures', 'such', 'one', 'coincidence', 'Gorgeous', 'Hussy', 'was', 'one', 'Joan', 'biggest', 'MGM', 'productions', 'entire', '18', 'year', 'career', 'studio', 'epic', 'history-driven', 'picture', 'not', 'factually', 'accurate', 'borrow', 'heavily', 'past.First', 'have', 'say', 'Joan', 'amazing', 'picture', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'long', 'hair', 'love', 'petticoats', 'long', 'dresses', 'wore', 'Joan', 'wore', 'very', 'well', 'classical', 'timeless', 'beauty', 'was', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'period', 'Joan', 'performance', 'Peggy', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'Bow', 'was', 'one', 'good-looking', 'man', 'so', 'charming', 'gallant', 'movie', 'also', 'large', 'supporting', 'cast', 'biggest', 'stars', 'time', 'including', 'Mr.', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'one', 'only', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart.There', 'are', 'also', 'funny', 'comical', 'scenes', 'picture', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'well', 'strongly', 'suspect', 'Joan', 'was', 'able', 'borrow', 'heavily', 'talents', 'silent', 'actress', 'film', 'using', 'body', 'language', 'convey', 'million', 'different', 'emotions', 'Gorgeous', 'Hussy', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'dry', 'scenes', 'political', 'dialog', 'scenes', 'senate', 'come', 'mind', 'movie', '100', 'minutes', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'considred', 'very', 'long', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'fact', 'did', 'drag', 'slightly.Nevertheless', 'interesting', 'movie', 'film', 'fan', 'Golden', 'Era', 'should', 'watch']",N/A

The 2012 presidential campaign?  No, ""The Gorgeous Hussy.""Many people have noted that ""The Gorgeous Hussy"" is not historically accurate.  This is true and at the beginning of the picture they call it ""fiction""-drawn from real characters, but definitely fiction.  What did you expect? It's MGM in 1936.  There is a huge budget, lavish production values, beautiful costumes (male and female), top-notch acting and, of course, romance.The story centers around Peggy O'Neill, Joan Crawford, an innkeeper's daughter called ""Pothouse Peg,"" for her politics and her men.  The men are a list of Metro's best--Robert Taylor, Jimmy Stewart, Franchot Tone, Melvyn Douglas and Lionel Barrymore. Robert Taylor dominates the first quarter of the picture with his enormous energy, his playfulness, his rapport with Crawford and his skin-tight costume.  Taylor even sings and dances.After Bow Timberlake's (Taylor) heroic off screen death, things settle down.  Andrew Jackson (Barrymore) dominates every scene he's in. Beulah Bondi, as Rachel Jackson, is equally good. She won an Oscar nomination for her role. Joan Crawford is usually criticized for appearing in an historical picture because she was too ""modern.""  Here she handles her costumes beautifully, using her skirts to express a range of emotions.  While her acting is fine, she is overwhelmed by the male contingent.Franchot Tone, Crawford's husband at the time, is quietly effective as her second husband John Eaton.  Melvyn Douglas brings strength and intelligence to his role as Virginian John Randolph.

311113,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6302413532,Lawyeraau,"[5, 5]","This is a mediocre historical drama, based on the book by Samuel Hopkins Adams about the life of Peggy O'Neill Eaton, a  Washington hostess who received a fair amount of notoriety  during the presidency of Andrew Jackson. The film was apparently a box office bomb when it was released. While Ms. Crawford has done better films, it is a mildly entertaining movie and should appeal to Joan Crawford fans.Joan plays the role of Peggy O'Neill Eaton, the outspoken daughter of a Washington innkeeper. She has decided political views and is quite free in expressing them. It is those very views that are destined to keep her apart from the great love of her life, Senator John Randolph of Virginia (Melvyn Douglas), the political foe of her uncle Andrew Jackson (Lionel Barrymore).After first marrying an officer (Robert Taylor) and  ending up widowed shortly thereafter, she ultimately ends up marrying Senator Eaton (Franchot Tone), a man of whom Andrew Jackson approves. In the interim, she acts as a sort of unofficial first lady for Andrew Jackson, a role which brings her notoriety among Washingtonians who censure her and make her the object of malignant gossip, just as they did with President Jackson's wife, Rachel (Beulah Bondi), who died just before Jackson took office.Joan Crawford looks fresh faced and beautiful throughout and does what she can with the thankless role. Melvyn Douglas does likewise with his. Lionel Barrymore is terrific as Andrew Jackson, as is Beulah Bondi in the role of Rachel Jackson. Franchot Tone shines, as he always does when he is cast opposite Joan Crawford. It is clear that he is smitten by her. No wonder he and Ms. Crawford ended up getting married in real life. There is even a small part played by a very young James Stewart. Even with a stellar cast, however, the movie does not quite cut it. The problem lies with the screenplay and not with the acting.

311114,AAW58LG72PG7I,6302413532,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 1]","Americans don't know much about their early Presidents, but what they do know about the seventh President Andrew Jackson is mostly limited to an awareness of his nickname, Old Hickory.  In GORGEOUS HUSSY, we can see early on that Andrew Jackson (Lionel Barrymore) is a crusty curmudgeon who thinks nothing of swapping punches with a heckler.  Barrymore shakes his leonine head at least twice in each scene while thundering such witticisms as ""By the eternal"" or ""I expect to receive all your resignations (while confronting a hostile cabinet).""  Director Clarence Brown, however, clearly means for the dramatic focus to be on Joan Crawford, who as Peg Eaton, becomes the unofficial First Lady when Mrs. Jackson (Beulah Bondi) dies.  Crawford as Peg Eaton had a difficult role in that Director Brown does not permit her to be the same scratchy clawing shop girl whom a Depression ridden America had been accustomed to see.  Here she is reduced to a cliche-ridden stereotype as a woman who is shunned and scorned by a ""respectable"" Washington elite.  She marries Robert Taylor, who dies early on, plans a marriage to Melvyn Douglas which goes predictably astray, then settles for real-life husband Franchot Tone.  And while all these marriage issues ascend and descend, there is Crawford vainly trying to inject some much needed audience interest which begins to flag despite the combined histrionics of Barrymore and Crawford.The action of GORGEOUS HUSSY takes place during a particularly tumultuous era of American history, when a fever of secession based on states' rights was just then beginning to foment to erupt in a few decades as a civil war.  But here, except for a few scenes of politicians blathering about the heavy hand of Washington suffocating the right of southern states to call their own shots, one might never know that anything material was happening outside of the fancy balls and dining halls of Old Hickory's cabinet. GORGEOUS HUSSY has nowhere very interesting to go.  Joan Crawford is gorgeous and is called a hussy on more than one occasion, but the result is a film in which we see and hear her act but in a dramatic vacuum that trivializes the stasis of an era that was anything but.",3,Good Soap: Lacks Momentum,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,2210,"['Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'early', 'Presidents', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'seventh', 'President', 'Andrew', 'Jackson', 'mostly', 'limited', 'awareness', 'nickname', 'Old', 'Hickory', 'GORGEOUS', 'HUSSY', 'can', 'see', 'early', 'Andrew', 'Jackson', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'crusty', 'curmudgeon', 'who', 'nothing', 'swapping', 'punches', 'heckler', 'Barrymore', 'leonine', 'head', 'least', 'twice', 'scene', 'thundering', 'such', 'witticisms', 'eternal', 'expect', 'receive', 'resignations', 'confronting', 'hostile', 'cabinet', 'Director', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'however', 'clearly', 'dramatic', 'focus', 'be', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'who', 'Peg', 'Eaton', 'unofficial', 'First', 'Lady', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Jackson', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', 'Crawford', 'Peg', 'Eaton', 'had', 'difficult', 'role', 'Director', 'Brown', 'not', 'permit', 'be', 'same', 'scratchy', 'clawing', 'shop', 'girl', 'whom', 'Depression', 'ridden', 'America', 'had', 'been', 'accustomed', 'see', 'Here', 'reduced', 'cliche-ridden', 'stereotype', 'woman', 'who', 'shunned', 'scorned', 'respectable', 'Washington', 'elite', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'who', 'early', 'marriage', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'predictably', 'astray', 'then', 'real-life', 'husband', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'marriage', 'issues', 'ascend', 'descend', 'Crawford', 'vainly', 'trying', 'inject', 'much', 'needed', 'audience', 'interest', 'flag', 'combined', 'histrionics', 'Barrymore', 'Crawford.The', 'action', 'GORGEOUS', 'HUSSY', 'place', 'particularly', 'tumultuous', 'era', 'American', 'history', 'when', 'fever', 'secession', 'based', 'states', 'rights', 'was', 'just', 'then', 'beginning', 'foment', 'erupt', 'few', 'decades', 'civil', 'war', 'here', 'few', 'scenes', 'politicians', 'blathering', 'heavy', 'hand', 'Washington', 'suffocating', 'right', 'southern', 'states', 'call', 'own', 'shots', 'one', 'might', 'never', 'know', 'anything', 'material', 'was', 'happening', 'fancy', 'balls', 'dining', 'halls', 'Old', 'Hickory', 'cabinet', 'GORGEOUS', 'HUSSY', 'nowhere', 'very', 'interesting', 'go', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'gorgeous', 'called', 'hussy', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'result', 'film', 'see', 'hear', 'act', 'dramatic', 'vacuum', 'stasis', 'era', 'was', 'anything']",N/A
311115,A2UYGOYMV73826,6302413532,Rushmore,"[0, 0]","This film was recently featured on This American Life.  The theme of that show was surrogates.  The story of Peggy O'Neal Eaton fit into that theme because Peggy was in a way a surrogate to Andrew Jackson.  Because the film is clearly labeled as a fictional interpretation of historical events, no conclusions should be drawn about the real Peggy's personal relationship with the President.  The Peggy of this movie does act as the de facto White House hostess after Rachel Jackson's death.  She calls the President Uncle Andy, a touch not necessarily supported by history.Other reviewers here have gone into great detail about the plot.  Having come to this film based on the piece in TAL, I expected to see more of the gossipy old biddies who made Peg's life so miserable.  Peg only has one line about calling on women whom she knew were at home, and not being received by them.  That would have been the unkindest cut.  The bullying of Rachel Jackson was much more brazen and more graphically depicted in the film.Joan Crawford is radiant in this role.  I do agree with other reviewers that it was maybe not in her wheelhouse, but she is mesmerizing to watch.  I do think she played the spunky youthful magnetic Peg more convincingly than the mature tortured Peg.  She never seems to suffer much, in spite of the bad things that happen to her.  Maybe Crawford's interpretation was meant to show that she could rise above anything, and that's what made her such a compelling figure.Beulah Bondi steals the show as Rachel.  Her performance alone is reason to dedicate the 100+ minutes to watching the movie.  Personally, I can't watch Lionel Barrymore's Andrew Jackson (or Lionel Barrymore in anything else, really) without thinking of Henry Potter in It's a Wonderful Life - his voice is too distinctive.The costumes are gorgeous.  I can't help wondering what they looked like in color.  Not that I would ever want this movie to be colorized.It's not a perfect movie.  The story plods a bit.  The script is a weak link - the final line of the movie is cringeworthy.  However, this is a visually attractive depiction of a fascinating point in history, with some very fine performances.

The movie revolves around Margaret O'Neal (Joan Crawford), a beautiful and headstrong girl with a group of suitors following behind her. From a very young age, she knew that she wanted to marry John Randolph (Melvyn Douglas), but he feels that her extreme youth is to blame. Feeling jilted, she falls into the arms of the dashing Lt. Timberlake (Robert Taylor), much to the chagrin of John Eaton (Franchot Tone) and Rowdy Dow (Jimmy Stewart), but not for long. There are further problems when Margeret's beloved Andrew Jackson (Lionel Barrymore) struggles for office amid nasty gossip about his simple wife (Beulah Bondi). Her association with him makes Margaret the subject of similar rumors.The story sounds somewhat dull on paper, but the efforts of the talented cast make for a very exciting and enjoyable film. In fact, one wishes that each one could be showcased better; the use of so many great faces in just one film seems to waste thier abilities. Crawford and Barrymore benefit the most. Crawford is beautiful as always and Barrymore could act his way through any part while still retaining his unique qualities. It is interesting to see the two together again after their very different pairing in the successful Grand Hotel only a few years earlier. Taylor, Tone, and especially Stewart leave the viewer wanting more, which can make their scenes somewhat disappointing.The names of the characters might sound familiar, and many of them should, but as the disclaimer in the beginning of the film says, the story is only loosely based on people that really existed.

The production was earmarked for the full-scale Metro treatment, and Eaton was the kind of plumb role that usually went to Norma Shearer. But Shearer wasn't interested, so the coast was clear for Crawford. Mayer tried to dissuade her - he thought she was too modern for costume parts - but when RKO refused to lend him Katharine Hepburn for this one picture, Mayer bowed before Crawford's persistence. Certainly the studio owed her a favour, and sometimes it was wisest to let a star stub his or her own toe: that way they would become more manageable in the future. As it turned out, Mayer was right about Crawford - she didn't seem at ease in period costumes, and the picture turned out to be a real clinker. Despite the abysmal reviews, THE GORGEOUS HUSSY returned a small profit, but the studio mail made it clear that Crawford fans were sorely disappointed.

311118,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302413532,Simon Davis,"[9, 9]","Lavish in execution, beautiful to look at, and well acted by all the principals, director Clarence Brown's production of ""The Gorgeous Hussy"" marked a dramatic change in direction for Joan Crawford away from the highly successful shop girl melodramas upon which her 1930's stardom was based into the new area of costume dramas.Critics at the time were sharply divided over this effort with the majority feeling that Joan Crawford had a far too modern screen persona to be tackling an historical drama. Joan does give the piece her dramatic all however I also feel that perhaps she was better suited to contemporary dramas such as in ""Mannequin"" and ""The Shining Hour"". Indeed the title is a trifle misleading as really Peggy comes across as quite a noble, self sacrificing type who never really does anything that could be ever referred to as scandalous. ""The Gorgeous Hussy"" tells the story of a simple inn keeper's daughter Peggy O'Neal (Crawford) who is one of the life long influences in the rise to power of President Andrew Jackson and who from her devotion to his cause unwittingly becomes the centre of scandal and envy in the nation's capital. The film boasts a excellent cast and was an all out effort by MGM to come up with a historical Blockbuster. Lionel Barrymore has one of his best roles as President Andrew Jackson and his bluff, no nonsense acting style goes well with the gruff backwoodsman turned presidential candidate. Beulah Bondi however absolutely steals the show as his simple wife Rachel Jackson who lives to support her beloved husband and becomes the butt of all the society ladies' jokes because of her simple way of life and her pipe smoking. Bondi, always a sensitive accomplished player quite rightly earned an Academy Award nomination for this role of the President's wife. Melvyn Douglas, a frequent Crawford costar plays John Randolph, the representative from Virginia who Peggy loves all her life but who she finds herself in opposition with over politics. More than any of the other leading men in this film Robert Taylor really shines in the brief role of Lt. Timberlake, a sailor who falls for Peggy and eventually marries her even though he knows her heart belongs to another. His early death at sea opens up the way for Peggy to support Jackson in his campaign for President. Taylor, long thought of as just a handsome leading man here brings a much needed lighthearted quality to his playing which is very enjoyable and his highjicks in wooing Peggy are very amusing. Franchot Tone, Crawford's husband in real life plays Peggy's second husband, ambassador John Eaton who Peggy really only marries as a favour to Andrew Jackson. Rounding out the other supporting performances are James Stewart in an early MGM appearance as Roderick Dow an early friend of Peggy's and Gene Lockhart in a fine performance as Peggy's inn keeper father.While ""The Gorgeous Hussy"" shows expertise in every department from Adrian's stunning recreations of 1830's fashions, to the Cedric Gibbons set pieces of early Washington and the historical research into the era, there is a certain something missing that stops ""The Gorgeous Hussy"" from ever being a truly great historical drama. The material here is handled professionally but the basic story lacks any real excitement and action. The individual performances by Barrymore, Bondi and Taylor certainly give the film it's memorable moments but I feel that Joan Crawford is not entirely comfortable playing this type of a character which normally at this time at MGM would have been assigned to the likes of Norma Shearer. While she delivers her usual capable performance some of the fire is missing from the character to indicate that she could have become such a great influence on the President of the United States. Beautiful she certainly is throughout the running time of the film but she brings her usual ladylike demeanor to the part which perhaps should have been modified some what.Nevertheless ""The Gorgeous Hussy"" is an enjoyable viewing experience. The storyline may not be totally riverting but it is an ambitious effort which shows all the wonderful expertise that MGM was able to muster for both in front of and behind the cameras. As an example of mid 1930's filmaking it is a magnificent effort and in that light it needs a kinder appraisal than that which it received upon its first release. It's interesting from the point of view of seeing Joan Crawford in her MGM heyday tackling a very different type of role and for that alone I recommend all Joan Crawford lovers and those that like beautiful looking productions to give this movie a viewing.",4,Joan Crawford is gorgeous but certainly no hussy,1040515200,"12 22, 2002",2002,4639,"['Lavish', 'execution', 'beautiful', 'look', 'well', 'acted', 'principals', 'director', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'production', 'Gorgeous', 'Hussy', 'marked', 'dramatic', 'change', 'direction', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'away', 'highly', 'successful', 'shop', 'girl', 'melodramas', '1930', 'stardom', 'was', 'based', 'new', 'area', 'costume', 'dramas.Critics', 'time', 'were', 'sharply', 'divided', 'effort', 'majority', 'feeling', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'had', 'far', 'too', 'modern', 'screen', 'persona', 'be', 'tackling', 'historical', 'drama', 'Joan', 'give', 'piece', 'dramatic', 'however', 'also', 'feel', 'perhaps', 'was', 'better', 'suited', 'contemporary', 'dramas', 'such', 'Mannequin', 'Shining', 'Hour', 'Indeed', 'title', 'trifle', 'misleading', 'really', 'Peggy', 'across', 'quite', 'noble', 'self', 'sacrificing', 'type', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'ever', 'referred', 'scandalous', 'Gorgeous', 'Hussy', 'story', 'simple', 'inn', 'keeper', 'daughter', 'Peggy', ""O'Neal"", 'Crawford', 'who', 'one', 'life', 'long', 'influences', 'rise', 'power', 'President', 'Andrew', 'Jackson', 'who', 'devotion', 'cause', 'unwittingly', 'centre', 'scandal', 'envy', 'nation', 'capital', 'film', 'excellent', 'cast', 'was', 'out', 'effort', 'MGM', 'come', 'up', 'historical', 'Blockbuster', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'President', 'Andrew', 'Jackson', 'bluff', 'nonsense', 'acting', 'style', 'well', 'gruff', 'backwoodsman', 'turned', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', 'however', 'absolutely', 'show', 'simple', 'wife', 'Rachel', 'Jackson', 'who', 'support', 'beloved', 'husband', 'butt', 'society', 'ladies', 'jokes', 'simple', 'way', 'life', 'pipe', 'smoking', 'Bondi', 'always', 'sensitive', 'accomplished', 'player', 'quite', 'rightly', 'earned', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'role', 'President', 'wife', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'frequent', 'Crawford', 'costar', 'John', 'Randolph', 'representative', 'Virginia', 'who', 'Peggy', 'life', 'who', 'opposition', 'politics', 'More', 'other', 'leading', 'men', 'film', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'really', 'brief', 'role', 'Lt.', 'Timberlake', 'sailor', 'who', 'Peggy', 'eventually', 'even', 'heart', 'early', 'death', 'sea', 'up', 'way', 'Peggy', 'support', 'Jackson', 'campaign', 'President', 'Taylor', 'long', 'thought', 'as', 'just', 'handsome', 'leading', 'man', 'here', 'much', 'needed', 'lighthearted', 'quality', 'playing', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'highjicks', 'wooing', 'Peggy', 'are', 'very', 'amusing', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'Crawford', 'husband', 'real', 'life', 'Peggy', 'second', 'husband', 'ambassador', 'John', 'Eaton', 'who', 'Peggy', 'really', 'only', 'favour', 'Andrew', 'Jackson', 'Rounding', 'out', 'other', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'James', 'Stewart', 'early', 'MGM', 'appearance', 'Roderick', 'Dow', 'early', 'friend', 'Peggy', 'Gene', 'Lockhart', 'fine', 'performance', 'Peggy', 'inn', 'keeper', 'father.While', 'Gorgeous', 'Hussy', 'expertise', 'department', 'Adrian', 'stunning', 'recreations', '1830', 'fashions', 'Cedric', 'Gibbons', 'set', 'pieces', 'early', 'Washington', 'historical', 'research', 'era', 'certain', 'something', 'missing', 'Gorgeous', 'Hussy', 'ever', 'being', 'truly', 'great', 'historical', 'drama', 'material', 'here', 'handled', 'professionally', 'basic', 'story', 'real', 'excitement', 'action', 'individual', 'performances', 'Barrymore', 'Bondi', 'Taylor', 'certainly', 'give', 'film', 'memorable', 'moments', 'feel', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'not', 'entirely', 'comfortable', 'playing', 'type', 'character', 'normally', 'time', 'MGM', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'assigned', 'likes', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'usual', 'capable', 'performance', 'fire', 'missing', 'character', 'indicate', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'such', 'great', 'influence', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'Beautiful', 'certainly', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'usual', 'ladylike', 'demeanor', 'part', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'modified', 'what.Nevertheless', 'Gorgeous', 'Hussy', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'storyline', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'totally', 'riverting', 'ambitious', 'effort', 'wonderful', 'expertise', 'MGM', 'was', 'able', 'muster', 'front', 'cameras', 'example', 'mid', '1930', 'filmaking', 'magnificent', 'effort', 'light', 'kinder', 'appraisal', 'received', 'first', 'release', 'interesting', 'point', 'view', 'seeing', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'MGM', 'heyday', 'tackling', 'very', 'different', 'type', 'role', 'alone', 'recommend', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'lovers', 'like', 'beautiful', 'looking', 'productions', 'give', 'movie', 'viewing']",N/A
