I liked his encounters with fellow celebrities, invariably spiced with ""Mr"" or ""Miss"" in the southern way but they don't seem any deeper than a stranger might have with them, be they Boy George on a camel or Faye Dunaway in a limo in Paris. He seems lost in his world and it was good to share it for a while.",3,seems stereotypical at best,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,560,"['i', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'too', 'close', 'home', 'just', 'unfunny', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'little', 'sympathize', 'video', 'gay', 'out', 'straight', 'men', 'obsessed', 'only', 'gay', 'ones', 'not', 'ones', 'would', 'reciprocate', 'liked', 'encounters', 'fellow', 'celebrities', 'invariably', 'spiced', 'Mr', 'Miss', 'southern', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'deeper', 'stranger', 'might', 'have', 'be', 'Boy', 'George', 'camel', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'limo', 'Paris', 'lost', 'world', 'was', 'good', 'share', 'while']",Leslie Jordan: My Trip Down The Pink Carpet

So when his first show ""Like a Dog on Linoleum' first played here in Atlanta, I couldn't wait to see it.  I don't think I have ever laughed so hard at any show in my life.  (Note to Leslie and Breaking Glass Productions- PLEASE put that show on DVD too!).  So when this show came to Atlanta, I knew it was going to be just as good, and I was right.  Now everyone can see it on DVD.  And it is well worth the price.  Leslie can take the most common of 'gay' experiences (being bullied, trying to go into your first gay bar) and make it so hilarious through the humiliation and fear it actually was.  Then he can turn around the describe his experience in a straight recovery group and really make you think.Leslie is a truly gifted comedic talent, and I hope he is back on TV soon in a starring role.  As he says towards the end of the show, he is one of the 'fabulous' queers.  I think that is a perfect way to describe him.",5,Hilarious,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,1063,"['have', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Leslie', 'Jordan', 'long', 'time', 'tv', 'movies', 'thought', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', ""'Will"", 'Grace', 'when', 'first', 'show', 'Dog', 'Linoleum', 'first', 'played', 'here', 'Atlanta', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'show', 'life', 'Note', 'Leslie', 'Breaking', 'Glass', 'Productions-', 'PLEASE', 'put', 'show', 'DVD', 'too', 'So', 'when', 'show', 'came', 'Atlanta', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'right', 'Now', 'everyone', 'can', 'see', 'DVD', 'well', 'price', 'Leslie', 'can', 'take', 'most', 'common', ""'gay"", 'experiences', 'being', 'bullied', 'trying', 'go', 'first', 'gay', 'bar', 'make', 'so', 'hilarious', 'humiliation', 'fear', 'actually', 'was', 'Then', 'can', 'turn', 'around', 'describe', 'experience', 'straight', 'recovery', 'group', 'really', 'make', 'think.Leslie', 'truly', 'gifted', 'comedic', 'talent', 'hope', 'back', 'TV', 'soon', 'starring', 'role', 'end', 'show', 'one', ""'fabulous"", 'queers', 'think', 'perfect', 'way', 'describe']",Leslie Jordan: My Trip Down The Pink Carpet

""My Trip Down The Pink carpet"" is his one-man show where Jordan delivers anecdotal stories, jokes and zingers about his life. It's highly entertaining, funny, and towards the end, when Jordan goes into the details about his rehab and ongoing sobriety (and how he has found a way to give back), serious.It's a great deal of fun to watch a man who tells the audience ""I fell out of my mother's womb and right into her high heels"" describe a life that is gay with a capital G, and makes no bones about it. Certainly, he is preaching to the choir here, but ""My Trip Down the Pink Carpet"" shows Jordan as a man who survived the Hollywood machine with his wit intact. The stories about Boy George, George Clooney and Marc Harmon are funny and some of his one liners are laugh out loud bulls-eyes. More to the point, the success of this self described ""I'm the gayest man I know"" is inspirational.",4,Good Old Southern Gay Boy Makes Good,1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,1053,"['Leslie', 'Jordan', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'play', 'movie', 'TV', 'series', 'Sordid', 'been', 'making', 'rounds', 'Hollywood', '30', 'years', 'Trip', 'Down', 'Pink', 'carpet', 'one-man', 'show', 'where', 'Jordan', 'anecdotal', 'stories', 'jokes', 'zingers', 'life', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'end', 'when', 'Jordan', 'details', 'rehab', 'ongoing', 'sobriety', 'how', 'found', 'way', 'give', 'back', 'serious.It', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'watch', 'man', 'who', 'audience', 'fell', 'out', 'mother', 'womb', 'right', 'high', 'heels', 'life', 'gay', 'capital', 'G', 'bones', 'Certainly', 'preaching', 'choir', 'here', 'Trip', 'Down', 'Pink', 'Carpet', 'Jordan', 'man', 'who', 'survived', 'Hollywood', 'machine', 'wit', 'intact', 'stories', 'Boy', 'George', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Marc', 'Harmon', 'are', 'funny', 'one', 'liners', 'are', 'loud', 'bulls-eyes', 'More', 'point', 'success', 'self', 'described', ""'m"", 'gayest', 'man', 'know', 'inspirational']",Leslie Jordan: My Trip Down The Pink Carpet
