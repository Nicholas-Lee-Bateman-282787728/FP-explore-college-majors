690322,A3INLC1MKXAJSP,B00005YUND,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Othello has always been one of my favorite Shakespeare plays and this modern day retelling certainly does it justice. The main reason I traveled over an hour to acquire this DVD was for two reasons. The first was that I loved the BBC serial Tipping the Velvet and this is done by the same scriptwriter (Andrew Davies), director (Geoffry Sax) and includes two of the star actresses for the two leading female roles in both films (Keeley Hawes and Rachael Stirling) and the second was as I said Othello is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. One thing I am glad about was that Davies decided to use modern language. I for one dislike it when they use the original script from Shakespeare's plays in modern adaptations because I feel that that just makes it anachronistic like in Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet. This was a great rendition because like a good cover of a classic song, it is still recognizable as the original yet the creators made it distinctly there own. All the major actors played magnificently here especially Christoper Eccleston as Ben Jago. He was just so manipulative and evil, but yet convincing that it chilled me at times. Him breaking the fourth wall was an interesting decision and I felt that it worked well. Overall this was a magnificent work I would recommend it to anyone.",5,A Great Retelling That is Fit to Stand on its Own,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,1304,"['Othello', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'modern', 'day', 'retelling', 'certainly', 'justice', 'main', 'reason', 'traveled', 'over', 'hour', 'acquire', 'DVD', 'was', 'two', 'reasons', 'first', 'was', 'loved', 'BBC', 'serial', 'Tipping', 'Velvet', 'done', 'same', 'scriptwriter', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'director', 'Geoffry', 'Sax', 'two', 'star', 'two', 'leading', 'female', 'roles', 'films', 'Keeley', 'Hawes', 'Rachael', 'Stirling', 'second', 'was', 'said', 'Othello', 'one', 'favorite', 'Shakespeare', 'One', 'thing', 'am', 'glad', 'was', 'Davies', 'decided', 'use', 'modern', 'language', 'one', 'dislike', 'when', 'use', 'original', 'script', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'modern', 'adaptations', 'feel', 'just', 'anachronistic', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'Romeo', '+', 'Juliet', 'was', 'great', 'rendition', 'good', 'cover', 'classic', 'song', 'still', 'recognizable', 'original', 'creators', 'made', 'distinctly', 'own', 'major', 'actors', 'played', 'magnificently', 'here', 'especially', 'Christoper', 'Eccleston', 'Ben', 'Jago', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'manipulative', 'evil', 'yet', 'convincing', 'chilled', 'times', 'Him', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'was', 'interesting', 'decision', 'felt', 'worked', 'well', 'Overall', 'was', 'magnificent', 'work', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone']",Othello
690323,ATC2WM08ZF9C1,B00005YUND,book worm,"[5, 19]","This is a terrible adaption of Shakespeare's Othello. It's more like an adaption of someone's interpretation of Othello, one that I do not necessarily agree with. This movie steers so off-course that it doesn't accurately follow the storyline in the original Othello, thus changing everything and really not having anything to do at all with Shakespeare's play. There is virtually no acting going on in this movie. Instead, there are a lot of in-your-face shots of the characters, giving the viewers a forced set of motivations for the inevitable to happen, which are not convincing in any sense. Sure it happens in the original play, but it is not convincing enough in this version.Instead of the climax becoming Othello's growing rage and madness, the climax in this movie is when the Iago character perches nude on the edge of a bathtub in a very gargoylesque pose. It becomes obvious why they chose this particular actor to play Iago, or Jago as he is called in the movie, with his ugly gargoylesque looks. It all goes downhill after this scene. The Iago character is constantly shown in close-up, advising viewers ""This is a tragedy"" or ""It's all about love."" I guess a viewer could never be sure since it is not obvious in this movie's plot.Besides of the tragic element in Shakespeare's Othello, there is also a thin thread of dark humor, the misunderstandings newly weds may have with each other, the miscommunications between the sexes, the blindness of love that sometimes blows things out of porportion, the bitterness and disillusionment of older married couples. All these elements that add another dimension to Othello are completely omitted in this version, since as we are informed by the annoying Jago character, ""It is a tragedy.""I would highly recommend skipping this one and watching ""O"" or ""Switchblade Sisters"" instead, two non-Elizabethan versions of Othello that are more on cue, and American-made versions incidentally, and perhaps surprisingly.",1,A Travesty,1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,1970,"['terrible', 'adaption', 'Shakespeare', 'Othello', 'more', 'adaption', 'someone', 'interpretation', 'Othello', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'agree', 'movie', 'steers', 'so', 'off-course', ""n't"", 'accurately', 'follow', 'storyline', 'original', 'Othello', 'thus', 'changing', 'everything', 'really', 'not', 'having', 'anything', 'do', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'virtually', 'acting', 'going', 'movie', 'Instead', 'are', 'lot', 'in-your-face', 'shots', 'characters', 'giving', 'viewers', 'forced', 'set', 'motivations', 'inevitable', 'happen', 'are', 'not', 'convincing', 'sense', 'Sure', 'original', 'play', 'not', 'convincing', 'enough', 'version.Instead', 'climax', 'becoming', 'Othello', 'growing', 'rage', 'madness', 'climax', 'movie', 'when', 'Iago', 'character', 'perches', 'nude', 'edge', 'bathtub', 'very', 'gargoylesque', 'pose', 'obvious', 'why', 'chose', 'particular', 'actor', 'play', 'Iago', 'Jago', 'called', 'movie', 'ugly', 'gargoylesque', 'looks', 'downhill', 'scene', 'Iago', 'character', 'constantly', 'shown', 'close-up', 'advising', 'viewers', 'tragedy', 'love', 'guess', 'viewer', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'obvious', 'movie', 'plot.Besides', 'tragic', 'element', 'Shakespeare', 'Othello', 'also', 'thin', 'thread', 'dark', 'humor', 'misunderstandings', 'newly', 'weds', 'may', 'have', 'other', 'miscommunications', 'sexes', 'blindness', 'love', 'sometimes', 'things', 'porportion', 'bitterness', 'disillusionment', 'older', 'married', 'couples', 'elements', 'add', 'dimension', 'Othello', 'are', 'completely', 'omitted', 'version', 'are', 'informed', 'annoying', 'Jago', 'character', 'tragedy', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'skipping', 'one', 'watching', 'O', 'Switchblade', 'Sisters', 'instead', 'two', 'non-Elizabethan', 'versions', 'Othello', 'are', 'more', 'cue', 'American-made', 'versions', 'incidentally', 'perhaps', 'surprisingly']",Othello

Wilson,"[0, 0]","The final result in this version of Othello is like that of the original: The green-eyed monster wins.Fortunately the BBC decided to use the concepts of Shakespeare's Othello but not to try to adapt the words to a modern setting. In this version, John Othello is the head of the London police force during a series of racial crises.After losing at his own game of office politics, and realizing that Othello does not see him as a lover, Jago's plotting uses race only as a weapon. His hatred and revenge are much more personal.John Othello's tragic end is like that of the Moor: He realizes too late that while Jago/Iago has betrayed him, Othello has eagerly participated in that very betrayal and his own self-destruction.Well written and well acted, this movie demonstrates the dynamism of the old story of a man ""who loved more than any man should.""Like other versions of the story: Not for the faint of heart.",4,Monsters in London,1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,913,"['final', 'result', 'version', 'Othello', 'original', 'green-eyed', 'monster', 'wins.Fortunately', 'BBC', 'decided', 'use', 'concepts', 'Shakespeare', 'Othello', 'not', 'try', 'adapt', 'words', 'modern', 'setting', 'version', 'John', 'Othello', 'head', 'London', 'police', 'force', 'series', 'racial', 'crises.After', 'losing', 'own', 'game', 'office', 'politics', 'realizing', 'Othello', 'not', 'see', 'lover', 'Jago', 'plotting', 'race', 'only', 'weapon', 'hatred', 'revenge', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'personal.John', 'Othello', 'tragic', 'end', 'Moor', 'too', 'late', 'Jago/Iago', 'betrayed', 'Othello', 'eagerly', 'participated', 'very', 'betrayal', 'own', 'self-destruction.Well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'movie', 'dynamism', 'old', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'more', 'man', 'should', 'other', 'versions', 'story', 'Not', 'faint', 'heart']",Othello
690326,AUFK6UT2DU87H,B00005YUND,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[0, 0]","""Othello"" is a timeless classic, proven by the many adaptations of Shakespeare's universal work.  This version, starring Eman Walker and Christopher Eckleston, is thought-provoking and unforgettable.John Othello, (Walker) is a police officer who is given the opportunity to become the first black Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London.  John's mentor and close friend, Ben Jago, was next in line for the job.  Spurred by irrational anger and a twisted love/hate relationship with his protege,, the unscrupulous Ben Jago determines to have his revenge.  John has married Dessie, (Kellie Haus), much to the chagrin of her snobbish, upper-class father.  Jago calculatingly manipulates situations and weaves a poisonous web of deception as he forces John to question his wife's fidelity.The Bard's classic language is replaced by modernday English, and there are several liberties taken with the plot.  If you are a purist, you will probably be disappointed.  However, if you are looking for a fresh, vibrant examination of Shakespeare's masterpiece, then I'd recommend this gem.  Walker is unsurpassable: his Othello is brooding and unflinchingly flawed.  He is also strong, and the viewer takes to him immediately.  Walker has brilliantly portrayed the original character of Othello in the Globe Theatre production, which is available on DVD as well.Eckleston is chilling as Iago: his high-pitched, smooth voice will soothe the viewer into a lethargic, honeyed trap.  When his true intentions are revealed, the viewer recoils as if from a repellent serpent.  I'd love to see Eckleston try his hand at Shakespeare's original work.Please give this riveting film a chance.

This retelling of Othello dispenses with Shakepeare's poetry, replaces it with modern dialog and drops the story down into modern day London.
