1206093,A20CSFERC3VINT,B001JAHSAA,"80s fan ""Adam""","[0, 0]","This is the last good season of the show. I always did think it was a great show although I don't even know how I got into it. The show should have ended here because it ended with Will getting married. I mean yeah he doesn't in the end but I still think it should have ended this way.Did you know that Will Smith wanted the series to end because his movie career was gaining momentum at the time and he wanted to focus on that. He was also going back into making albums as well with Big Willie Style in 1998 and the show would have been in his way with the time commitments required for taping. There are rumors that Smith was ready to call it quits earlier (going back to Philly) but with the show still being popular, he decided to continue for a little while longer to satisfy the fans.Season 5 was a great season but their were some weak episodes. Save the Last Trance for Me was probably the worst one of the season and I think would have fitted better for season 6. Kim Fields and Sherman Hemsley appear again but as different charterers. Lisa (Nia Long) was great. She was a great actress and a good girlfriend and almost wife for Will.I doubt I will get season 6 because to me this is the end.

1206107,A3INQQEX56YKJV,B001JAHSAA,PSF,"[0, 0]","Season 4 of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air ended on a poignant cliffhanger.  With Will becoming reminded of how much he truly loved his Philadelphia roots upon experiencing them firsthand during the Banks' family vacation thereto, Smith hesitates to return to Bel-Air.  But, after thinking it over (in this case, by contract agreement [gotta love the hilarious opening scene of the Season 5 debut]), Will quickly heads out west to resume his alter ego.Speaking of the season opener, the two-part beginning to the series's fifth year in operation (""The Client""/""What's Will Got To Do With It"") parodies Motown in its caricature of record company founder, Berry Gordy, as ""Gordy Berry"".  (For those viewers who have seen the miniseries, The Temptations, actor Obba Babatunde played Berry Gordy in that movie in 1998, four years after the brief stint as ""Gordy Berry"" in Fresh Prince.)  In terms of the plot of this episode, Will attempts to help Ashley launch her signing career through auditioning for Gordy, with the hopes of getting her discovered in the music business.  While the result is unfortunate, the hilarity and cleverness that ensue in the buildup are not to be reckoned with!Many of the episodes of Season 5 contain thick plots and detailed storylines--whether elaborated upon over two episodes, or packed into one, each--which help to make them (and the season itself) quite memorable.  A lot of classics are featured this year, including ""The Wedding Show (Psyche!)""--in which Will and his girlfriend-turned-fiancee from this season (Jackie from Season 4 has querily vanished from the face of the earth), Lisa, flee from their fathers' bickering about wedding arrangements and head to Vegas for a trippy yet hilarious Shaft-style ""wedding ceremony"" (the late, great Isaac Hayes guest stars in this episode).  By replacing ""Shaft"" with ""[Will] Smith"", and absorbing Lisa's father's fiery wit towards Uncle Phil during the opening scenes: [Lisa's father, to Uncle Phil] ""Have you ever worked one honest day in your life?!""  [Uncle Phil] ""Excuse me?!  I happen to be a judge!""  [Lisa's father] ""I'm a take that as a 'no'"", this episode will have you rolling in hysterics!  One other gem of an episode is ""To Thine Own Self Be Blue...and Gold""--in which a college fraternity friend of Uncle Phil's con's Will into working a mob-related job for him, jeopardizing his and Uncle Phil's old friendship.  Regardless of the dark humor, the highlights of that particular episode involve Will, Uncle Phil, and Uncle Phil's friend gettin' down to ""Ain't Too Proud To Beg"" at the beginning and end of the story (this was a throwback to the entire Banks Family dancing to the same song in Season 1's Thanksgiving episode, ""Talking Turkey"").With regards to the other characters on the show, Hilary is still Hilary; Ashley progresses further into womanhood, and her rebellious outlook increases from that which she held in Season 4 (now leaving Will to frequently come to her rescue); Carlton's regard for Will grows, especially when Will gets shot in the two-part ""Bullets Over Bel-Air/""A Decent Proposal"" episode; Jeffrey increases his sarcastic nature, also gaining the Will Smith influence of permanently poking fun at Uncle Phil's massive bodyweight and temperament.  (Will, however, briefly experiences life through the opposite physical angle when he wears a body suit to simulate weight gain and corresponding public ridicule, in ""Will Steps Out"".)So although the show begins to fade from its outlandish comedy once held at the beginning of its run, Season 5 remains intact with charm, depth, and lots of smiles.

The season premiere was enjoyable (as well as a few episodes later on when Will started a long term relationship with Lisa - played by Nia Long), but many of the episodes became way too obnoxious to attempt to compensate for increasing number of serious episodes that occured on seasons 3 and 4.  Starting with this season, most of the characters are even louder and more obnoxious than previous season.  Geoffrey, the butler appears to be the only character on the show who appears to be more humorous as the seasons progressed.  Not one episode retains its magic from the first 3 seasons and I think the series should have ended with season 4.  It was bad enough that Janet Hubert was replaced with the lame Daphne Maxwell-Reid last season, but it got worse when the producers aged baby Nicky four more years (recruiting young actor, Ross Bagley) for this season.
