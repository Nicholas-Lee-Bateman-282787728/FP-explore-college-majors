888399,A1RS6WVHAIBJLE,B0007R4T7Q,In the pink,"[2, 2]",I like this film. A male cinderella story that was marred slightly by the political ending. The film would have ended better leaving off with just the Robson Green character's transformation. I thought the Prince's learned nothing and was nothing more than incidental. Will be ordering more Robson Green. He is a wonderfully charismatic actor.,4,"Good movie, weak ending",1208995200,"04 24, 2008",2008,343,"['like', 'film', 'male', 'cinderella', 'story', 'was', 'marred', 'slightly', 'political', 'ending', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'better', 'leaving', 'off', 'just', 'Robson', 'Green', 'character', 'transformation', 'thought', 'Prince', 'learned', 'nothing', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'incidental', 'Will', 'be', 'ordering', 'more', 'Robson', 'Green', 'wonderfully', 'charismatic', 'actor']",N/A

888401,A1TRPKDQWEP23V,B0007R4T7Q,Meerkat,"[22, 25]","For the most part, I enjoyed this production.  Robson Green (Barry the police officer) and Rupert Penry-Jones (the prince) play their parts well even though the story is all over the place - borrowing a great deal from Cyrano as well as Educating Rita.  My only complaint is with the female lead.  I admire Tara Fitzgerald's work very much, but in this role as an American exchange student, she is not very believeable.  Some of the reason why is the script (which is a little too corny for words at times), but her accent is all over the place.  She is trying hard to sound like the bohemian American she plays (it doesn't play very convincingly), but then constantly slips between an American accent and an English accent, sometimes in the same sentence.  The ending is a little silly, but overall, if you are not expecting a life changing experience, The Student Prince is an entertaining way to spend 92 minutes.",4,All over the place,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,916,"['most', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'production', 'Robson', 'Green', 'Barry', 'police', 'officer', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'prince', 'play', 'parts', 'well', 'even', 'story', 'place', 'borrowing', 'great', 'deal', 'Cyrano', 'as', 'well', 'Educating', 'Rita', 'only', 'complaint', 'female', 'lead', 'admire', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'work', 'very', 'much', 'role', 'American', 'exchange', 'student', 'not', 'very', 'believeable', 'reason', 'why', 'script', 'little', 'too', 'corny', 'words', 'times', 'accent', 'place', 'trying', 'hard', 'sound', 'bohemian', 'American', ""n't"", 'play', 'very', 'convincingly', 'then', 'constantly', 'American', 'accent', 'English', 'accent', 'sometimes', 'same', 'sentence', 'ending', 'little', 'silly', 'overall', 'are', 'not', 'expecting', 'life', 'changing', 'experience', 'Student', 'Prince', 'entertaining', 'way', 'spend', '92', 'minutes']",N/A

The fun begins when cop bodyguard and the prince encounter Grace, an American exchange student for whom they both fall -- hard. When the prince proves as inept at love as he is at learning, the bodyguard finds himself become tutor as well as protector, ghostwriting sweet nothings and academic assignments, all the while repressing his own feelings for Grace. A BBC American and PBS ""Masterpiece Theatre"" production that would make a splendid and very popular addition to any community library Video/DVD collection, The Student Prince is widescreen, full color, 92-minutes, and enhanced with this DVD format to include a Robson Green biography, a photo gallery, and cast filmographies.",5,A superbly produced and thoroughly entertaining British drama production,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,910,"['Robson', 'Green', 'Barry', 'working-class', 'cop', 'assigned', 'protect', 'queen', 'youngest', 'son', 'who', 'new', 'student', 'Cambridge', 'Student', 'Prince', 'superbly', 'produced', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'British', 'drama', 'production', 'fun', 'when', 'cop', 'bodyguard', 'prince', 'encounter', 'Grace', 'American', 'exchange', 'student', 'whom', 'fall', 'hard', 'When', 'prince', 'inept', 'love', 'learning', 'bodyguard', 'become', 'tutor', 'as', 'well', 'protector', 'ghostwriting', 'sweet', 'nothings', 'academic', 'assignments', 'while', 'repressing', 'own', 'feelings', 'Grace', 'BBC', 'American', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'production', 'would', 'make', 'splendid', 'very', 'popular', 'addition', 'community', 'library', 'Video/DVD', 'collection', 'Student', 'Prince', 'widescreen', 'full', 'color', '92-minutes', 'enhanced', 'DVD', 'format', 'include', 'Robson', 'Green', 'biography', 'photo', 'gallery', 'cast', 'filmographies']",N/A
888403,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0007R4T7Q,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","The only reason I picked this movie up at my local library was seeing Robson Green on the cover. I love his work, especially in the crime dramasTouching Evil: Complete CollectionandWire in the Blood - Complete First Season. Well, there's no blood and gore in this movie, thankfully! It's a 1998 romantic drama set in Cambridge, England.Green plays policeman Barry Grimes who is assigned to be the bodyguard to a prince of Britain's royal family (played by Rupert Penry-Jones who despite this unfortunate role goes on to distinguish himself in the crime drama,White Chapel: The Ripper Returnswhile the Prince attends Cambridge. There Barry encounters an attractive American student, Grace (played by Tara Fitzgerald ofThe Camomile LawnandThe Tenant of Wildfell Hall), a Fullbright Scholar who loves literature. Grace initially mistakes Barry for a fellow student, but later learns the truth.Meanwhile, the Prince is portrayed as an incompetent - he can't play soccer, is terrible in academics, and is also socially inept. There's nothing much to like about the Prince's character, and Penry-Jones' lackluster portrayal does not do much for this character either. The Prince decides he fancies Grace, and thus begins a romance story in the tradition of Cyrano de Bergerac, with Barry (who fancies Grace himself) helping the Prince woo and win her heart.The story is OK. I would not rate this as an above average romance drama. There are some light-hearted moments but Penry-Jones and Fitzgerald (who has the most awful American accent) do not deliver their best here, and it shows. Only Green's performance, in my opinion, saves this movie. He is earnest and credible as the conflicted bodyguard who wants to do what is right, and at the same time struggles with the yearnings in his heart. I'd recommend this as a rental or check it out of your local library.",3,Robson Green makes it worthwhile,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,1858,"['only', 'reason', 'picked', 'movie', 'up', 'local', 'library', 'was', 'seeing', 'Robson', 'Green', 'cover', 'love', 'work', 'especially', 'crime', 'dramasTouching', 'Evil', 'Complete', 'CollectionandWire', 'Blood', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'Well', 'blood', 'gore', 'movie', 'thankfully', '1998', 'romantic', 'drama', 'set', 'Cambridge', 'England.Green', 'policeman', 'Barry', 'Grimes', 'who', 'assigned', 'be', 'bodyguard', 'prince', 'Britain', 'royal', 'family', 'played', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'who', 'unfortunate', 'role', 'distinguish', 'crime', 'drama', 'White', 'Chapel', 'Ripper', 'Returnswhile', 'Prince', 'Cambridge', 'Barry', 'attractive', 'American', 'student', 'Grace', 'played', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'ofThe', 'Camomile', 'LawnandThe', 'Tenant', 'Wildfell', 'Hall', 'Fullbright', 'Scholar', 'who', 'literature', 'Grace', 'initially', 'Barry', 'fellow', 'student', 'later', 'truth.Meanwhile', 'Prince', 'portrayed', 'incompetent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'soccer', 'terrible', 'academics', 'also', 'socially', 'inept', 'nothing', 'much', 'like', 'Prince', 'character', 'Penry-Jones', 'lackluster', 'portrayal', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'character', 'either', 'Prince', 'Grace', 'thus', 'romance', 'story', 'tradition', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'Barry', 'who', 'Grace', 'helping', 'Prince', 'woo', 'win', 'heart.The', 'story', 'OK', 'would', 'not', 'rate', 'above', 'average', 'romance', 'drama', 'are', 'light-hearted', 'moments', 'Penry-Jones', 'Fitzgerald', 'who', 'most', 'awful', 'American', 'accent', 'do', 'not', 'deliver', 'best', 'here', 'Only', 'Green', 'performance', 'opinion', 'movie', 'earnest', 'credible', 'conflicted', 'bodyguard', 'who', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'same', 'time', 'yearnings', 'heart', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'rental', 'check', 'local', 'library']",N/A
