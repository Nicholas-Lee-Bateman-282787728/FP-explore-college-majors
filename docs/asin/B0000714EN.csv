""Daniel""","[7, 12]","If you're familiar with the works of the danish directors who've signed the DOGMA charter, GANG TAPES may please you with its improbable camera movements and its documentary style. If not, stay away from this movie.The director Adam Ripp has chosen to present us the life of a group of friends in the black districts of East L.A. The point of view is not objective, it's the point of view of the person who's filming through the lenses of a video camera stolen from white tourists. As different persons are interested by this camera, the point of view is often changing although it is mainly in the hands of Kris, a 14 years old boy.I must admit that the scenes of violence of GANG TAPES are, in my opinion, far more impressive than those shown in the Hollywood thrillers. You never know what will happen next on the screen and you really feel in your guts the paranoia which is the life's companion of these people. And the impacts of the bullets in the body of the victims will hit you as if you were present in the hot streets of the city of the angels.A DVD zone discovery.",4,TWO  DAYS  IN  THE  VALLEY,1057190400,"07 3, 2003",2003,1077,"[""'re"", 'familiar', 'works', 'danish', 'directors', 'who', ""'ve"", 'signed', 'DOGMA', 'charter', 'GANG', 'TAPES', 'may', 'please', 'improbable', 'camera', 'movements', 'documentary', 'style', 'not', 'stay', 'away', 'movie.The', 'director', 'Adam', 'Ripp', 'chosen', 'present', 'life', 'group', 'friends', 'black', 'districts', 'East', 'L.A', 'point', 'view', 'not', 'objective', 'point', 'view', 'person', 'who', 'filming', 'lenses', 'video', 'camera', 'stolen', 'white', 'tourists', 'different', 'persons', 'are', 'interested', 'camera', 'point', 'view', 'often', 'changing', 'mainly', 'hands', 'Kris', '14', 'years', 'old', 'boy.I', 'must', 'admit', 'scenes', 'violence', 'GANG', 'TAPES', 'are', 'opinion', 'far', 'more', 'impressive', 'shown', 'Hollywood', 'thrillers', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'screen', 'really', 'feel', 'guts', 'paranoia', 'life', 'companion', 'people', 'impacts', 'bullets', 'body', 'victims', 'will', 'hit', 'were', 'present', 'hot', 'streets', 'city', 'angels.A', 'DVD', 'zone', 'discovery']",N/A
724238,A218J58CFFQOPW,B0000714EN,D. Myatt,"[0, 0]","Very steady-handed directing anchors this low-budget urban indie about a stolen camcorder. Surprisingly well-made and acted; naturalistic performances all around, and not a missed note to be found. Story's really nothing new, just told from a somewhat refreshing angle. I'd say the director achieved what he attempted to do. And he's not too preachy or heavy-handed with the project's anti-gang message -- thus making it quite an effective and unglamorized cinematic little sermon. It gets genuinely intense at times as a result of its ultra-realistic sheen and assured acting, and it's well-paced and never dull, even when character's are unleashed to tell their tales at length. Overall, an enjoyable little movie, well-conceived, executed (no pun intended -- it's graphically violent), and presented.

I picked this movie up on a kind of lark, simply looking for something that looked interesting. I wandered into a masterpiece. From the first frame, this film is captivating, confident, and shocking. It's so good that by the end, you're holding your breath, praying that it doesn't fall apart, as you assume it must. It never does. I don't know where this movie came from, who any of the actors are, who the directors are, nothing... but if you have any interest in gang behavior, or the human beings involved in it, you have no business not seeing this movie.Lest you think I'm being uncritical in my praise, you should know that I thought ""Boyz N the Hood"" was overrated and sugar-sweet, and that I thought ""Menace II Society"" was the closest cinema was ever going to get to the streets. But ""Gang Tapes"" comes from a different reality than either of those films. You watch it in awe, because nobody seems to be acting, nobody seems to be directing... indeed, nothing seems to be being filmed. There is a scene where there is a home invasion and one of the women in the house is raped. I looked around the empty room I was sitting in, as if I had inadvertantly become a party to a felony.But, you ask, what is this movie ABOUT? What happens in it? What am I walking into?Trust me, it's better not to know. I walked into this movie cold, knowing nothing but what I got from the advertising blurb. Read the back of the DVD, and plunge in like I did. You will not regret it.I can't stress this any more: if you love cinema, you owe it to yourself to see ""Gang Tapes."" And yes, if you told me that an hour and thirty minutes ago, I'd have laughed heartily at you.This isn't a gold mine. This is a cache of platinum. Stop whatever you're doing, and dive in. Trust me, you'll want to campaign in the streets for this masterpiece. Only my better judgment prevents me from doing the same.Footnote: As of February, 2007, ""Gang Tapes"" has made its way into my DVD collection. It fits snugly between ""Floating Weeds"" and ""The General."" I hope for your sake--as a filmgoer--that means something to you. But I stick by my decision to say no more than what I have said about the events in the film. Just see it.",5,"See it now. No, really. Now.

724241,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B0000714EN,maskedgamer,"[1, 5]","Another ""boyz n tha hood"" type of film that we've all seen before.This one must have missed being released in the 90's back with ""Blacks In The Ghetto"" were still profitable for Hollywood and ""suburban white folks"" were willing to spend good money to see what they can view for free if they decided to travel to the hood.The movie pretty much comes down to overplayed stereotypes of African Americans. If they aren't sitting down rapping,fighting,playing dice,smoking weed, they are outside trying to rob,shoot people, or sell drugs. This movie is only believable if you're dumb enough to believe this is what it's really like in the hood because that's all this movie conveys. The group in the movie is far from a ""Gang"". More like friends that grew up together that made their own wanna be gang.For the most part I couldn't get over how they let the main character film everything they do from selling drugs to committing felonies. I also enjoyed his mother who was apparently working all the time but could only afford a Giant $10.99 Family box of oatmeal and said she didn't have money for a $1.99 pack of bacon and a $2.49 pack of eggs. because ""they don't eat that stuff"". Apparently times must be hard in the hood they don't even have grocery store sales. Sheesh.This movie is entertaining in the same way ""White Boyz"" was. It's like watching a train wreck. It so horrible to look at but still you can't take your eyes off of it.This movie is more of a comedy.
