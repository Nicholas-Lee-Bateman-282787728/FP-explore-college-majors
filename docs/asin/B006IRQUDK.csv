Some of the episodes were unwatchable. When I tried to view them, they kept throwing me back to the main menu. Several others would repeatedly stop and then sometimes they would continue on, but other times they did not. I know that the problem wasn't the DVD player, because I cleaned it several times, and wiped the DVDs too. When I did get the episodes to play, they were fine. I have not had this problem with an Amazon purchase before.

1515732,A1TCZZHL5OD5B0,B006IRQUDK,Rita P. Swift,"[6, 6]","Andy Griffith and his very talented co/stars gave us nine seasons of mystery with Southern comfort. Unfortunately,only seven seasons have been released. The photography, stories, and the down home attitude of Matlock solvingthe mysteries with his helpers who not only take us across America, but Europe too. You feel you are part of thestory and mentally help solve the mysteries and help convict the criminals in court. I wish that Matlock could have teamed up with J B Fletcher, Murder She Wrote, to do a mystery movie together. I highly recommend Matlock.The 1970's, 1980's and early 1990's had some very good series and Matlock was one of the best. Andy Griffithwill always be remembered for his talent and the hours of enjoyment he gave us.
