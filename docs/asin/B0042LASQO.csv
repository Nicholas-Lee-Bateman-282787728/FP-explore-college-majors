I knew the movie industry is repsonsible for a lot of the pollution in Los Angeles, but I had no idea it was this much.This documentary is short ands sweet but goes into a lot of details as to why and how the industry uses up so much resources. Defintely makes you want to go green after watching this one.",4,Must see for any filmmaker.,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,330,"['Saw', 'other', 'day', 'knew', 'movie', 'industry', 'repsonsible', 'lot', 'pollution', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'much.This', 'documentary', 'short', 'ands', 'sweet', 'lot', 'details', 'why', 'how', 'industry', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'resources', 'Defintely', 'want', 'go', 'green', 'watching', 'one']",N/A

It is fairy short, 60 mi or so, and very funny. It moves quickly and while you are laughing you actually realize that Miranda Bailey the film maker just taught you something. I learned a lot and wasn't annoyed at the fact that I learned how wasteful I am. I actually stopped using as many water bottles because of this film...well, talk to me in a month, but for now I am going to try. Its cute, funny, and I loved it how she calls out Leo DiCaprio for being a bit of a hypocrite. Funny watching the Green girl heard geese too.Definitely watch it.",5,Good little Doc for Greenies and Movie lovers,1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,686,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'stomach', 'long', 'preachy', 'doc', 'environment', 'movie', 'just', 'opposite', 'fairy', 'short', '60', 'mi', 'so', 'very', 'funny', 'quickly', 'are', 'laughing', 'actually', 'realize', 'Miranda', 'Bailey', 'film', 'maker', 'just', 'taught', 'something', 'learned', 'lot', 'was', ""n't"", 'annoyed', 'fact', 'learned', 'how', 'wasteful', 'am', 'actually', 'stopped', 'using', 'many', 'water', 'bottles', 'film', 'well', 'talk', 'month', 'now', 'am', 'going', 'try', 'cute', 'funny', 'loved', 'how', 'out', 'Leo', 'DiCaprio', 'being', 'bit', 'hypocrite', 'Funny', 'watching', 'Green', 'girl', 'heard', 'geese', 'too.Definitely', 'watch']",N/A

I had no idea the amount of waste that the film industry creates. It seems as if a lot of Hollywood stars are big supporters of creating a more green culture but that is not really practiced in their own industry.  It was really interesting seeing the difficulty of making even one film more 'green'. But the film shows the complexities of creating a green set and how it can be more costly and make the jobs of the crew more difficult.I would recommend to anyone who is interested in how films are made and those concerned with 'green' culture.,4,Eye-opening,1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,664,"['was', 'really', 'informative', 'documentary', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'had', 'idea', 'amount', 'waste', 'film', 'industry', 'lot', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'are', 'big', 'supporters', 'creating', 'more', 'green', 'culture', 'not', 'really', 'practiced', 'own', 'industry', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'difficulty', 'making', 'even', 'one', 'film', 'more', ""'green"", 'film', 'complexities', 'creating', 'green', 'set', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'costly', 'make', 'jobs', 'crew', 'more', 'difficult.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'how', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'concerned', ""'green"", 'culture']",N/A

1383441,A3N9YID6VTNBNZ,B0042LASQO,Rkilla,"[0, 0]","Greenlit is a short documentary about the concern of making the entertainment industry more environmental friendly. The film gets straight to the point, it entertains you, and best of all it takes on a largely objective point of you (unlike many modern documentaries). We get to see the filmmakers attempt at making a ""green"" production and get reactions from the crew members themselves. Not everybody agrees with the green set approach but they do at the least become more environmentally sound. Greenlit is worth the watch, especially for those in the industry. You can learn a bit about recycling and at least question your methods in the making of a film and in life in general.",5,Great eye-opener,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,683,"['Greenlit', 'short', 'documentary', 'concern', 'making', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'more', 'environmental', 'friendly', 'film', 'straight', 'point', 'best', 'largely', 'objective', 'point', 'many', 'modern', 'documentaries', 'get', 'see', 'filmmakers', 'attempt', 'making', 'green', 'production', 'get', 'reactions', 'crew', 'members', 'Not', 'everybody', 'green', 'set', 'approach', 'do', 'least', 'become', 'more', 'environmentally', 'sound', 'Greenlit', 'watch', 'especially', 'industry', 'can', 'learn', 'bit', 'recycling', 'least', 'question', 'methods', 'making', 'film', 'life', 'general']",N/A
