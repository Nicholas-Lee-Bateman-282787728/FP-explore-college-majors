In truth Michael Sarne's version isn't as bad as all that: the film offers a suggestive view of how gender constructions are constructed in different societies, and how prejudice often inhibits individuals from expressing themselves.  Hence Myra's (Raquel Welch's) desire to take revenge on those members of the patriarchy who oppress her. Sarne's film uses images of the Golden Age of Hollywood to contrast the grimy reality of present-day (i.e. late 60s) America with the dream-factory world portrayed onscreen.  There are some truly bizarre elements: with her fake blonde wig and reedy voice, Mae West resembles a hellish version of Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder's SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950).

571684,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B0000583NW,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[104, 114]","Seldom seen since theatrical release in 1970, MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has become a byword for cinematic debacles of legendary proportions.  Now at last on DVD in an unexpectedly handsome package, it will be of interest to film historians, movie buffs, and cult film fans--but it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released.Gore Vidal's 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement on American hypocrisy, Hollywood fantasies, and changing sexual mores.  Most filmmakers felt that the novel's story, structure, and overall tone would not translate to film, and industry insiders were surprised when 20th Century Fox not only acquired the rights but also hired Vidal to adapt his novel to the screen.  But studio executives soon had cold feet: Vidal's adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice writer-director Michael Sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen.Studio executives hoped that Sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film, but Sarne proved even more out of synch with the material than the executives themselves.  Rewrite upon rewrite followed.  The cast, sensing disaster, became increasingly combative.  In her commentary, star Raquel Welch says that she seldom had any idea of what Myra's motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself, and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film.  In the accompanying ""Back Story"" documentary, Rex Reed says that MYRA BRECKINRIDGE was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls.The accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself, which contains a host of good ideas that work individually but never consolidate into anything that approaches a cohesive film.  The basics of Vidal's story are there, but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications, it seems to have no point in and of itself.  Everything runs off in multiple directions, nothing connects, and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had.  And while director Sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce, the only laughs generated are accidental.Chief among these accidents is Mae West.  It is clear from Sarne's commentary that he idolized West; in her own commentary Welch flatly states that West had carte blanche to do what she wished, be it write her own lines or demand the inclusion of  two musical numbers or not work before five in the afternoon.  It is true that West is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one-liner--but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies, and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling, to say the least.  But worse, really, is the fact that West is outside her era.  Her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing self-characatures ever seen on film.The remaining cast is largely wasted. Raquel Welch, a significantly underestimated actress, plays the title role of Myra very much like a Barbie doll on steroids; non-actor Rex Reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of Myron, but the entire role is essentially without point.  Only John Huston and cameo players John Carradine, Jim Backus, William Hopper, and Andy Devine emerge relatively unscathed.  Yes, it really is the debacle everyone involved in the film feared it would be: fast when it should be slow, slow when it should be fast, relentlessly unfunny from start to finish.  It is true that director Sarne does have the occasional inspired idea--as in his use of film clips of everyone from Shirley Temple to Judy Garland to create counterpoint to the action--but by and large, whenever Sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong choice.The how and why of that is made clear in Sarne's audio commentary.  Sarne did not like the novel or, for that matter, the subject matter in general.  He did not want to write the screenplay, but he needed the money; he emphatically did not want to direct the film, but he need the money.  He makes it very clear that he disliked author Gore Vidal and Rex Reed (at one point he flatly states that Reed ""is not a nice person""), and to this day he considers that Vidal and Reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their  'homosexual agenda'--which, when you come right down to it, seems to have been their desire that Sarne actually film Vidal's novel rather than his own weirdly imagined take-off on it.Although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community, Sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people.  When taken in tandem with the film itself, Sarne emerges as more than a little homophobic--and quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project.In addition to the Sarne and Welch commentaries and the making-of documentary, the DVD includes several trailers and two versions of the film: a ""theatrical release"" version and a ""restored"" version.  The only difference between the two is that the final scene in the ""restored"" version has been printed to black and white.  The edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored, but the documentary details what they were.  The widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine.  But to end where I began, this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians, movie buffs, and cult movie fans.  I give it three out of five stars for their sake alone, but everyone else should pass it by.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,A Cinematic Debacle of Legendary Proportions,1108857600,"02 20,

That's when John Houston enters the picture as Buck Loner. Loner runs and acting school filled losers of every race and life style. The school is barely surviving and that's when Myra shows up on the school doorstep.  Myra informs Buck that he was married to one of his relatives and that she's entitled to have of his estate. Stalling Buck gives Myra a job as a teacher until he can fine a **** ** *** *****. Now a thought on this picture! How can you waste Raquel Welch talent in this stupid picture? This movie had no action, no plot and very little comedy. Mae West was just awful in this picture and so was John Houston. Making her film debut was Farrah Fawcett and even thought it was a very young Farrah Fawcett she wasn't half bad. The only thing that made this movie worth watching has Raquel Welch. When Raquel wasn't on I fast forward until I got to her parts. Her wardrobe in this picture was fantastic. Her acting was just as good; however, it was a shame that they waste such great talent in a movie like this. On the movie itself, I give this picture 1 weasel star because the picture doesn't get your attention or keep it. However, if you're a Raquel Welch fan like I am then watch it for Raquel only because that's all you fine interesting in this picture.",1,Bad Bad Bad!,1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,1695,"['Bad', 'Bad', 'Bad', 'picture', 'opened', 'theaters', 'June', '24', '1970', 'starring', 'John', 'Houston', 'Buck', 'Loner', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'Myra', 'Breckinridge', 'Rex', 'Reed', 'Myron', 'Myron', 'have', 'sex', 'change', 'operation', 'waiting', 'operation', 'room', 'doctor', 'Right', 'surgery', 'Myron', 'not', 'have', 'surgery', 'Myron', 'sticks', 'guns', 'when', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'picture', 'Myra', 'Brecknridge', 'when', 'John', 'Houston', 'picture', 'Buck', 'Loner', 'Loner', 'acting', 'school', 'filled', 'losers', 'race', 'life', 'style', 'school', 'barely', 'surviving', 'when', 'Myra', 'up', 'school', 'doorstep', 'Myra', 'Buck', 'was', 'married', 'one', 'relatives', 'entitled', 'have', 'estate', 'Stalling', 'Buck', 'Myra', 'job', 'teacher', 'can', 'fine', '****', '**', '***', '*****', 'Now', 'thought', 'picture', 'How', 'can', 'waste', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'talent', 'stupid', 'picture', 'movie', 'had', 'action', 'plot', 'very', 'little', 'comedy', 'Mae', 'West', 'was', 'just', 'awful', 'picture', 'so', 'was', 'John', 'Houston', 'Making', 'film', 'debut', 'was', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'even', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'was', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'only', 'thing', 'made', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'When', 'Raquel', 'was', ""n't"", 'fast', 'forward', 'got', 'parts', 'wardrobe', 'picture', 'was', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'however', 'was', 'shame', 'waste', 'such', 'great', 'talent', 'movie', 'movie', 'give', 'picture', '1', 'weasel', 'star', 'picture', ""n't"", 'get', 'attention', 'keep', 'However', ""'re"", 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'fan', 'am', 'then', 'watch', 'Raquel', 'only', 'fine', 'interesting', 'picture']",N/A

I had to watch it over an expanded period of time, because it is so very badly written, executed, acted, and delivered.Rex Reed plays Myron Breckinridge who has a sex change operation and becomes Rachel Welch?!

Explosions and battle scenes are intercut into straight dialogue, not unlike some episodes of ""Love American Style"" from the 1960's and '70's.Vidal is said to have been appalled at the film, but Michael Sarne has said that it was Vidal and Reed who set out to sabotage the film from the start.In the end, it is we, the viewing public, who suffer.

As film adaptations of novels go, it's actually quite faithful to the material (except for its abstruse, cop-out non-ending, and the omission of a catfight between Myra and Letitia). Trashy movie? Okay, but so was the book.Since the whole point of the book was to satirize sleazy, depraved 1960s Hollywood, cheerfully devoid of ethics or morals, where even low-budget ""B"" movies of yesteryear could attain cultural status as camp (""During the years 1935 to 1945, no unimportant film was made in Hollywood,"" Myra instructs), what choice did the film version have--made by the self-same sleazy, depraved 1960s Hollywood, mind you--but to be exactly what this movie is?It's sad to find out what a painful experience filming was for the cast, because they're all wonderfully effective within the helter-skelter framework. (It seems only John Huston understood the material enough to have had fun with it.) Raquel Welch at least seems to be having a ball as Myra. Of course it's absurd for 73-year-old Mae West to believe she was the star (and demand top billing) and to be given two--count 'em, two--songs to do, but who else could have delivered the line ""Get your resumes out"" quite like that? Tom Selleck and Farrah Fawcett, their TV stardom ahead of them, are both breathtakingly lovely. The inspired use of old film clips to comment on the action (a device stolen by the 1980s cable sitcom ""Dream On"") lifts the film to something perilously close to art.It's a great movie to watch with friends and drinks on New Year's Eve (more fun than paper hats and getting trashed among strangers).

She didn't want to be in this but she was under contract. She had no choice but decided to make the best of it. She says that initially she thought that she would be playing both Myra and Myron and that the movie would be a challenge. Someone decided that acerbic Film Critic Rex Reed should play Myron. (The title of this review is actually one of Rex's lines of dialog.) What?There aren't enough plastic surgeons in all of L.A. and N.Y.C. combined to turn Rex Reed into Raquel Welch. There aren't enough Ace bandages in the world to flatten Raquel's chest so that she could dress in men's clothing. Adding to the confusion, Raquel and Rex have a dance number together... at the same time...The screenwriters didn't seem to get the fact that Myra's film fantasies were just that and most of the flashbacks were happening in her mind. (She was really kind of a mess to look at.)Everybody is miscast, particularly Mae West. What I don't understand is why Mae came out of retirement for This particular Film? She was wealthy, She owned the half of Los Angeles that didn't already belong to Bob Hope. She had been offerred comeback films before this (including Sunset Boulevard) and had turned them all down. Her character, Letitia Van Allen was supposed to be a predatory talent agent. I imagined a non-singing Ethel Merman (although I'm sure that Merman never would have accepted this role).Mae insisted on singing the two songs: ""Hard to Handle"" (Otis Reddings' Hit) and ""You've got to taste all the fruit"" (Obvious), even though this made no sense.  Bewigged, painted up, trussed up, propped up and stuffed into (Edith Head, I think) costumes, she might as well be working from the adjoining sound stage as she croaks out her smutty dialog.

571690,A9I40WFF40R4,B0000583NW,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[2, 7]","This 1970 movie, based (?) on the novel of the same name by Gore Vidal defies description. First, this film appears to have little in common with Vidal's novel, as I remember it. I notice on the DVD case that Mr. Vidal ""denounced"" the film. Why wouldn't he? The movie is basically plotless. It would have needed a stellar cast to pull this off, but it stars the aging Mae West, Raquel Welch, the film critic Rex Reed and the director John Huston, along with Tom Selleck and Farrah Fawcett, not exactly great actors. Michael Sarne gets credit or the blame for directing and being 1/2 of the writing team responsible for happens here.There are certainly some funny moments here and indeed the movie may become a cult classic. Mae West plays herself, as do most of the other actors. And she can be mildly funny in a crude Mae West way. If this movie is about sexual identity-- and I haven't the vaguest notion if it is or not, although Rex Reed/Myron may have a sex-change or, according to the director's commentary, dreams he has one-- then surely the irony is not lost on anyone that Ms. West, by the time she made this movie, was the least real ""woman"" of any of the various and sundry bisexuals, post-op transexuals, whatever, and must be as artificial as any other ""woman"" in this travesty. Surely  nobody believes she looked like that at the end of her work day.Twentieth Century Fox posts a disclaimer at the beginning of this DVD about the opinions expressed in the commentary that go along with this movie. Both the director and Ms. Welch give their comments although I only watched Mr. Sarne's. He liked Ms. West and Mr. Huston but has most unkind things to say about Ms. Welch, Mr. Reed and particularly Mr. Vidal 30 years after he dropped this bomb on us. Mr. Sarne rambles on and on about what the movie is all about and what we are to glean from it, what he is trying to do, etc., etc. I must admit that most of his lessons sailed right over my head. Example: he says he only photographs Ms. West wearing white and black-- not exactly a true statement but who cares? -- because she heretofore had only made black and white movies. Okay! Then he enlightens us on the difference between the British use of ""camp"" and the U. S. version of ""campy."" I suspect this director is homophobic-- check out the mincing, lisping African American student--although Mr. Sarne is so ineffectual that it's difficult to care much.Vidal's novel is quite funny and certainly worth reading. I'm not sure a successful movie could ever be made from it. The late John Schlesinger had both the talent and sensivity to have brought this novel to the screen if anyone could have. But he didn't so we are left with this.

571692,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B0000583NW,James Morris,"[33, 35]","Gore Vidal's hilariously funny satiric novel was more or less transferred to the silver screen with a good deal of the story intact, but thanks to the hopeless mess made of the screenplay by the director, Michael Sarne, none of it makes a great deal of sense.  Still, the film has lots going for it.  I believe it was unmercifully and unfairly savaged by the critics as much for its revolutionary queer message as for its failures as a narrative.  Myra is not only a transsexual (Myra was filmed only a few years after the world's first sex-change operations made headlines) but her self-proclaimed mission is to ""realign the sexes"" by turning macho heterosexual boys into homosexuals - her way of saving the world from over-population.  No wonder the critics ran from the theatres, covering their crotches as they fled!  Myra is shrewd, witty, beautiful, talented, intelligent AND she is a woman who used to be a man - in short, she was everything that queer / transgender people were NOT supposed to be in 1970.  I happen to think that Raquel Welch gave the comic performance of her (early) career in this movie.  Sarne had the presence of mind to insert old film clips as a running commentary on the plot (signifying Myra's obsession with classic films) and that portion of his vision was sheer genius.  The film clips work just fine, providing many of the laughs.  Each time a perfectly innocent film clip was used as a commentary to the high jinks in this movie, it usually yielded an extremely funny but admittedly tasteless moment.  For instance, then President Richard Nixon reportedly had the studio delete a clip showing Shirley Temple milking a goat and getting sprayed in the face with milk.  What's so bad about that?  Well, it's inserted in a scene where Myron is having a masturbatory fantasy that Myra is performing fellatio on him (in the movie, Myron frequently substitutes for or has conversations with Myra - to remind us that they are the same person).  But so what?  The tasteless sexual jokes are half the fun, and they are generally a little classier than say, Pink Flamingos.Gore Vidal reportedly sued to have his name removed from the credits, but a good deal of his dialogue and lots of his satire is still intact.  Despite all the bad things you can say about this picture, I felt that the spirit of Vidal's book runs through every frame.  Farrah Fawcett is young enough to be practically unrecognizable, and the young manly hunk who plays Rusty (what ever happened to Roger Herren, anyway?) is dreamy enough to justify sitting through this curiosity.  Myra / Myron is such a queer revolutionary that the film seems way before its time, and in some ways, still does.  A 77 year-old Mae West had lost none of her famous timing, but the director reportedly cut about 20 minutes of her scenes.  I recall reading a rumor at the time that Sarne was incensed when he overheard a studio boss's remark that Fox was banking on Mae West's name to bring in the audience, and who the hell ever heard of Michael Sarne anyway?  I vividly recall a television reviewer remarking that Mae West had the only really funny lines in the picture, and that it was worth seeing for her appearance alone (she reportedly wrote her own portion of the screenplay).  Her quip to the cowboy after he answers her question, ""How tall are you without your horse?"" is not only the funniest moment in the whole film, it's classic Mae at her best.  The reported feud between Mae West and Raquel Welch made interesting items in the gossip columns of 1970, with Welch accusing West of making her own mini-movie within a movie (which is exactly what she did) and Mae retorting, ""Rachel?  She's a sweet thing - she has a scene or two in my picture, I believe"".  Mae got top billing, despite Raquel playing the lead character, which couldn't have made Raquel very happy, I'm sure.Some of the cameos are funny in themselves just for their casting  -Myron's surgeon is played by John Carradine, who counsels Myron, ""Are you sure you wouldn't like circumcision?  It'd be cheaper..."" and Mae West's first conquest in the picture is a practically pubescent Tom Selleck.  She plays an actor's agent - for men only - who auditions all of her clients on the four-poster bed in her office.  Mae and Tom trade a few very funny lines - she dismisses him from her office / boudoir with the comment, ""You've impressed me immensely - I'll keep you in mind as a summer replacement.  NEXT!""  I was a 16 year-old gay man when this movie opened, and I not only appreciated her conquest, I envied her attitude.And Rex Reed, a leading film critic of the sixties and seventies, proved (as Myron) that no matter what kind of critic you are, it doesn't mean you can act.  As far as I know, he never did another picture, unless you count his one line, two-second cameo in Superman: The Movie, eight years later.  Myra Breckinridge is pure camp - wait until you see Raquel decked out as Marlene Dietrich, or Mae West singing Otis Redding's HARD TO HANDLE, flanked by a chorus line of handsome African American studs in tuxedos.  Why is a talent agent singing in a nightclub?  Who cares - trust me, it's pure camp.  John Huston as Uncle Buck is absolutely perfect casting, and if you bother to spend a few hours reading the novel before you screen the film, the movie will make much more sense and be far more enjoyable.  The scene where Myra rapes Rusty in the infirmary was, in the novel, one of the most erotic passages I have ever read in a non-pornographic novel.

Most of the audience I watched it with in New York City got up and left. We all knew we had just paid good money to watch one of the most inept, God-Awful messes to ever come from a major studio. You cringe as you watch the mummified remains of Mae West totter around as if she's a wooden mannequin. Those horrendous one-liners she personally wrote herself make you wince. The very worst? A tall, handsome man says he needs to see her. Mae asks: ""How tall are you?"" He answers: ""Six feet and seven inches."" She tries to roll her eyes, and pat that plastic-looking blonde wig when she croaks: ""Forget the six feet. Let's discuss the seven inches."" Hearty har! Har! Raquel Welch is just as pitiful. She utters every line in this fluting, sing-song cadence without a drop of reality. The take-off on gays is nauseating. The black queen who minces and flutters his eyes is so repulsive you wonder what world he came from. Maybe parody was the theme.

He works hard at being naughty, but the film seems a far cry from the X-rating it originally received! This adaptation of Gore Vidal's celebrated novel(a pretty close match, by the way)does 'mod' better than most '60's comedies. ""Myra"" looks like a piece of candy, full of Jell-O reds and greens, creamy pastels and black-and-white Theodora Van Runkle costumes. It falters by letting Mae West strut her stuff unrestrained(her sex-crazed talent agent is now also a pop singer!)and her jokes(reportedly self-written)are smirky but not hilarious. Raquel Welch is surprisingly good as the half-crazed Myra B. (she's always on the verge of belting somebody, and you can sense her desperation and tension). Despite the picture's colorful production, there's an an obvious lack of cohesion behind the scenes, and the camera is almost never where it should be. For every gorgeous shot--like one of Farrah Fawcett smiling with Klieg lights firing up in the background--there's a mess of visual non sequiturs that leave the viewer rudderless. On the plus side, it's great to finally have this movie on DVD, as it includes some witty satire, a dead-on performance by John Huston as Uncle Buck, colorful cameos and some wild ideas(edited in a breakneck fashion that makes it seem almost modern). The AMC ""Backstory"" is wonderfully rueful and funny, with a recent interview with Rex Reed in which he finally gets to vent and sneer at the catastrophe his movie debut became(he's not too bad in it, he just needed some sharper dialogue).",3,Satire of Hollywood's loss of morals actually plays it pretty safe,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,1700,"['Director', 'Michael', 'Sarne', 'probably', 'considered', 'maverick', 'filmmaker', 'gleefully', 'taking', 'H-wood', 'sleaze', '1970', 'style', 'humor', 'are', 'resolutely', 'old-fashioned', 'hard', 'being', 'naughty', 'film', 'far', 'cry', 'X-rating', 'originally', 'received', 'adaptation', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'celebrated', 'novel', 'pretty', 'close', 'match', 'way', 'better', 'most', 'comedies', 'Myra', 'piece', 'candy', 'full', 'Jell-O', 'reds', 'greens', 'creamy', 'pastels', 'black-and-white', 'Theodora', 'Van', 'Runkle', 'costumes', 'letting', 'Mae', 'West', 'strut', 'stuff', 'unrestrained', 'sex-crazed', 'talent', 'agent', 'now', 'also', 'pop', 'singer', 'jokes', 'reportedly', 'self-written', 'are', 'smirky', 'not', 'hilarious', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'half-crazed', 'Myra', 'B', 'always', 'verge', 'belting', 'somebody', 'can', 'sense', 'desperation', 'tension', 'picture', 'colorful', 'production', 'obvious', 'lack', 'cohesion', 'scenes', 'camera', 'almost', 'never', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'gorgeous', 'shot', 'one', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'smiling', 'Klieg', 'lights', 'firing', 'up', 'background', 'mess', 'visual', 'non', 'sequiturs', 'leave', 'viewer', 'rudderless', 'plus', 'side', 'great', 'finally', 'have', 'movie', 'DVD', 'witty', 'satire', 'dead-on', 'performance', 'John', 'Huston', 'Uncle', 'Buck', 'colorful', 'cameos', 'wild', 'ideas', 'edited', 'breakneck', 'fashion', 'almost', 'modern', 'AMC', 'Backstory', 'wonderfully', 'rueful', 'funny', 'recent', 'interview', 'Rex', 'Reed', 'finally', 'vent', 'sneer', 'catastrophe', 'movie', 'debut', 'became', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'just', 'needed', 'sharper', 'dialogue']",N/A

It has flaws and every bad thing other critics have written is accurate.If Raquel Welch had not been cast in this movie, the thing would have fallen into oblivion as soon as it was released. Nobody, not even the most fanatical fan would buy this DVD to watch Mae West. She is not good at all. Okay, okay, she sucks, what can I say? You cut her scenes out of the film, make a few additions and nobody would ever worry about her contribution or lack of it to this epic.Raquel is irreplaceable. She is brilliant, carries the movie to its bitter (and oh, so sad) ending and is a major force. She offers an inspired performance and will remain unforgettable.Oh, and a tantalizing tibdit for the lecherous ones: this movie was shot in the pre-DVD era. At that time nobody had envision the possibility of zoom. So what? Nothing, except the directors and censors and people of strong moral capacity, did not cover things or care about exposed parts of the human body. It is possible to explore Ms. Welch's anatomy in detail should you be so wicked. Not that you will see much of anything because she was careful. However what you can see is wonderful if it fills your screen.

It was just mean spirited that the powers that be in movies exploited one of the greatest stars of all time, who clearly was not up to making that film, when she stood near the tan body builders she looked pale as a ghost. People could have done the right thing and not released that awful film, but human beings have incredibly capacity for greed. Anyway back to the Myra movie, and Mae truly looked excellent in this one. She had tons of energy, and her comic timing was as perfect as her films from decades ago. Unfortunately the film although very ultra high camp is such a waste of Mae, and the other stars. This movie even had the great John Houston, and he too had some incredibly embarrassing lines to say. It was fun to see the young and incredibly squeaky clean Farrah Fawcett, and also a very very young Tom Selleck,who camped it up with Mae West. If you are a Mae West fan and you are looking for a movie where she makes grand entrances, and she definitely still had that star power, rent or buy this film, and you will forgive the stupidity of the majority of the film. Raquel Welch has some wonderful outfits in here, but I'm sure today she would prefer to forget this celluloid mistake. There are definitely some memorable Mae West lines in here. There will never be another one like her, she was amazing!!!! I guess this movie in its time was quite shocking, but today it is very tame, and one wonders what West wanted with this stupid movie.

DONERIAN,"[9, 16]","I have wanted to see Myra Breckinridge since it came out in 1970.Indeed, it has been a difficult movie to find anywhere.I was thrilled when it came on DVD just recently.When I first watched it, I was sort of disappointed. I expected more. What? I don't know. So I had to give it a chance. After viewing it once, I then watched it with Raquel's commentary, and then with the Director's commentary.Raquel gave a great performance, as did John Huston (Buck Loner)and Mae West (Letitia Van Allen) was quite attractive in this film. This was her first color film ever, and after a long hiatus from the silver screen.There was alot of anymosity on this set, and I fault the Director Michael Sarne for this. If he hadn't been so full of himself, this might have worked better. I don't know who's in control of the script, or changes in the script, but this constant rewriting of the story didn't make matters better for the actors.I think the acting is top rate, and the actors deserve credit for taking lemons and making them into lemonade.I wrote to Raquel Welch recently to tell her alot of this and more, and I mean what I say.And maybe she's right.In the commentary I believe she wished that John Huston had been the director.

That's how Michael Sarne, director of this colossally misguided effort, was able to get the job. Sarne was one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie. In fact, the whole studio must have been on acid to agree to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film, a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called Joanna. That film starred the similarly talentless and painfully twee actress/waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter. Sarne, who was probably incapable of directing traffic in a supermarket aisle never mind a big-budget Hollywood film, was in way over his head. If the film looks horribly amateurish, that's because it is.If there is an historical marker indicating the superficiality and shallowness of an era, Myra Breckinridge provides that marker. It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic. Breckinridge is a touchstone of another, equally important vein: the debasement of culture. Watch this movie and you'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years.Many reviewers have spoken about the intercutting of footage from other, older (and better) films. Some actually liked these clunky ""comments"" on what was taking place in the movie, others found them pointless, annoying, and obtrusive, though since the film is so bad itself, any intrusion would have to be considered a welcome relief.In my opinion, the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was not a subversive and avant guard sensibility, but a paucity of invention, the clips were inserted in a last-ditch effort to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed. That is to say, Sarne was so artistically-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time. They weren't inspiration, they were desperation. His writing skills were virtually nonexistent, and screenwriter David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb, so Sarne was left to try and make a movie, and he couldn't. It was beyond his slim capabilities. Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film's worth of clips. The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck wasn't able to. This was what he came up with on those days he sat in a corner of the set and `thought' for eight hours while the entire cast and crew (not to mention the studio brass, the producers, and the accountants) cooled their heels and waited for something, some great spark of imagination, a hint of originality, a soupcon of wit to crackle forth from the brimming skull of Zeus. Um, oops. No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each fashioned from the dozens of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window. Bye-bye, Baby, bye-bye.As for myself, I hated the film clips. They denigrated Sarne's many betters and poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the Lilliputian abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration, originality, and just plain competency when compared to even the cheesiest of them. The film was doomed the day he was hired, and a very funny and original book by Gore Vidal became the jerky, manic, and supremely unfunny (except when it wasn't trying to be) Myra Breckinridge, The Meltdown.",1,Losers' Row,1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,3892,"['was', 'Sixties', 'anyone', 'long', 'hair', 'shambling', 'preoccupied', 'air', 'sensitivity', 'could', 'get', 'money', 'make', 'movie', 'how', 'Michael', 'Sarne', 'director', 'colossally', 'misguided', 'effort', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'job', 'Sarne', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'supremely', 'untalented', 'people', 'ever', 'given', 'dollar', 'make', 'movie', 'fact', 'whole', 'studio', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'acid', 'agree', 'hire', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'made', 'exactly', 'one', 'previous', 'film', 'terribly', 'precious', ""60's-hip"", 'black', 'white', 'featurette', 'called', 'Joanna', 'film', 'starred', 'similarly', 'talentless', 'painfully', 'twee', 'actress/waif', 'Genevieve', 'Waite', 'who', 'could', 'barely', 'speak', 'entire', 'line', 'breaking', 'inappropriate', 'facial', 'expression', 'bat-like', 'twitter', 'Sarne', 'who', 'was', 'probably', 'incapable', 'directing', 'traffic', 'supermarket', 'aisle', 'never', 'mind', 'big-budget', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'head', 'film', 'horribly', 'amateurish', 'historical', 'marker', 'indicating', 'superficiality', 'shallowness', 'era', 'Myra', 'Breckinridge', 'marker', 'emptiness', 'mindless', 'excess', 'decade', 'more', 'often', 'remembered', 'great', 'sea-change', 'body', 'politic', 'Breckinridge', 'touchstone', 'equally', 'important', 'vein', 'debasement', 'culture', 'Watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'get', 'different', 'perspective', 'less-often', 'mentioned', 'vacuity', 'spirit', 'so', 'often', 'passed', 'talent', 'years.Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'spoken', 'intercutting', 'footage', 'other', 'older', 'better', 'films', 'actually', 'liked', 'clunky', 'comments', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'movie', 'others', 'found', 'pointless', 'annoying', 'obtrusive', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'intrusion', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'considered', 'welcome', 'relief.In', 'opinion', 'real', 'reason', 'Michael', 'Sarne', 'put', 'so', 'many', 'film', 'clips', 'Myra', 'Brekinridge', 'was', 'not', 'subversive', 'avant', 'guard', 'sensibility', 'paucity', 'invention', 'clips', 'were', 'inserted', 'last-ditch', 'effort', 'paper', 'bottomless', 'insufficiency', 'wit', 'imagination', 'possessed', 'say', 'Sarne', 'was', 'so', 'artistically-challenged', 'just', 'threw', 'clips', 'fill', 'space', 'take', 'up', 'time', 'were', ""n't"", 'inspiration', 'were', 'desperation', 'writing', 'skills', 'were', 'virtually', 'nonexistent', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Giler', 'had', 'wisely', 'stepped', 'away', 'project', 'one', 'might', 'ticking', 'bomb', 'so', 'Sarne', 'was', 'left', 'try', 'make', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'was', 'slim', 'capabilities', 'Hence', 'introduction', 'what', 'one', 'half', 'entire', 'film', 'worth', 'clips', 'ghosts', 'writers', 'directors', 'many', 'long', 'passed', 'were', 'called', 'upon', 'fix', 'calamitous', 'flopperoo', 'Sarne', 'sure', 'heck', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'was', 'what', 'came', 'up', 'days', 'sat', 'corner', 'set', 'thought', 'eight', 'hours', 'entire', 'cast', 'crew', 'not', 'mention', 'studio', 'brass', 'producers', 'accountants', 'cooled', 'heels', 'waited', 'something', 'great', 'spark', 'imagination', 'hint', 'originality', 'soupcon', 'wit', 'crackle', 'forth', 'brimming', 'skull', 'Zeus', 'Um', 'Zeus', 'imagination', 'sparks', '=', 'millions', 'little', 'dollar', 'bills', 'tiny', 'wings', 'fashioned', 'dozens', 'licensing', 'agreements', 'required', 'use', 'clips', 'flying', 'out', 'window', 'Bye-bye', 'Baby', 'bye-bye.As', 'hated', 'film', 'clips', 'denigrated', 'Sarne', 'many', 'betters', 'poked', 'fun', 'people', 'talents', 'even', 'skills', 'were', 'not', 'great', 'far', 'outstripped', 'Lilliputian', 'abilities', 'director', 'so', 'ultimately', 'served', 'show', 'how', 'lacking', 'was', 'inspiration', 'originality', 'just', 'plain', 'competency', 'when', 'compared', 'even', 'cheesiest', 'film', 'was', 'doomed', 'day', 'was', 'hired', 'very', 'funny', 'original', 'book', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'became', 'jerky', 'manic', 'supremely', 'unfunny', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'Myra', 'Breckinridge', 'Meltdown']",N/A

She doesn't seem very well prepared and there's nobody there to ask her any questions, so at times she just sits quietly, but it's fun anyway.

571708,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B0000583NW,Phil S.,"[2, 5]","The review title tells it all. Besides giving us a rare chance to see the Diva at 73 looking 37 and delivering the only grounded performance in the whole film, her ""old-time"" persona is the perfect counterbalance to the out of control 1970, where sexual *ambiguity* is suddenly the new means to sell soap.This is not a good film; not completely bad: other pictures of the era like ""I Love YOu, Alice B. Toklas"", ""Skidoo"", Pretty Maids All In A Row"" are in the same genre - that kaleidoscopic new approach. Where effect is more important than cause.Movie critic Rex Reed does a decent job and John Huston, yes John Huston, does a *great* job. He's ""Uncle Buck"", a washed up Cowboy star running a watered down acting school (which discourages graduation because that's too...confining).Raquel Welch is Myra, Huston's adversary, and she takes it way over the top, exaggerating every syllable. She's after his money and also manages to take over his classes, employing zero theatrical experience. Raquel herself is so mechanical in this role, I'm not convinced her part was not dubbed!Other out of sync add-ons involve the alive and well Red Scare and a satrirical look at the Healthcare industry.To add to the confusion, we get countless, spruced up clips from Hollywood musicals; and from another act from Mae West's heydey, Laurel and Hardy: clips from one of their worst films, ""Great Guns"", are used. Apparently these *traditional* images are used to show the marked contrast with the new hippie Hollywood.(Mae West fans, enjoy: she even does the great Otis Redding song, ""Hard To Handle"").",3,Mae West Comeback,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,1591,"['review', 'title', 'giving', 'rare', 'chance', 'see', 'Diva', '73', 'looking', '37', 'delivering', 'only', 'grounded', 'performance', 'whole', 'film', 'old-time', 'persona', 'perfect', 'counterbalance', 'out', 'control', '1970', 'where', 'sexual', '*ambiguity*', 'suddenly', 'new', 'means', 'sell', 'soap.This', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'completely', 'bad', 'other', 'pictures', 'era', 'Love', 'YOu', 'Alice', 'B.', 'Toklas', 'Skidoo', 'Pretty', 'Maids', 'All', 'A', 'Row', 'are', 'same', 'genre', 'new', 'approach', 'Where', 'effect', 'more', 'important', 'cause.Movie', 'critic', 'Rex', 'Reed', 'decent', 'job', 'John', 'Huston', 'yes', 'John', 'Huston', '*great*', 'job', 'Uncle', 'Buck', 'washed', 'up', 'Cowboy', 'star', 'running', 'watered', 'down', 'acting', 'school', 'graduation', 'too', 'confining', '.Raquel', 'Welch', 'Myra', 'Huston', 'adversary', 'way', 'top', 'exaggerating', 'syllable', 'money', 'also', 'take', 'over', 'classes', 'employing', 'zero', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'Raquel', 'so', 'mechanical', 'role', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'dubbed', 'Other', 'sync', 'add-ons', 'involve', 'alive', 'well', 'Red', 'Scare', 'satrirical', 'look', 'Healthcare', 'industry.To', 'add', 'confusion', 'get', 'countless', 'spruced', 'up', 'clips', 'Hollywood', 'musicals', 'act', 'Mae', 'West', 'heydey', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'clips', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'Great', 'Guns', 'are', 'used', 'Apparently', '*traditional*', 'images', 'are', 'used', 'show', 'marked', 'contrast', 'new', 'hippie', 'Hollywood', 'Mae', 'West', 'fans', 'enjoy', 'even', 'great', 'Otis', 'Redding', 'song', 'Hard', 'Handle']",N/A
571709,AYF7IX9JLHU83,B0000583NW,"Richard Bellush, Jr.","[0, 0]","Fair warning: the majority of viewers will hate this movie. You may be an exception, however, if, as I do, you enjoy watching bad movies. Not any bad movie. Most bad movies are no fun at all. There is a particular sort of bad movie that is fun to watch. The necessary element for viewing pleasure is &#8220;camp,&#8221; which is notoriously hard to define but unmistakable when you see it. Not everyone experiences pleasure in camp &#8211; at least not readily, but for those who do, it is hard to do better than Myra Breckenridge.Vidal&#8217;s novel has something to say, and some of the message crosses over into the movie if you look for it. The gist of the plot: the protagonist, once Myron Breckenridge, thanks to the good surgeons of Copenhagen, becomes Myra. She doesn&#8217;t reveal her other-gendered past when she takes a teaching position at an acting school in LA. Myra is a Classic Film aficionado who argues that no insignificant movie was made between 1935 and 1945. She asserts that every culture has a mythology from which it derives an identity, and the movies of 1935-45 form the American mythology; the actors of the era are the gods and goddesses of our myths. They define our sense of ethics, our world view, and our ideals of masculinity and femininity. Therein lies the problem. She believes the sex roles embodied in these films were all very well for building a nation and fighting Nazis, but are inappropriate to a world facing overpopulation and nuclear weaponry. She wants to remold our mythology by means of the movies, creating an America and (to the extent Hollywood movies have global reach) a world that is more bisexual and less dominated by traditional masculine bluster. The birthrate thus will fall and pressure will be eased on the nuclear trigger. A school for actors is as good a place to start on this task as any.The traditional gender types reflective of &#8217;35-45 are embodied by two students at the film school who plan to marry. Rusty is handsome, swaggering, and a bit of an ass. His wholesomely pretty and air-headed girlfriend Mary-Ann (Farrah Fawcett) wants nothing more than a white picket fence and four children with Rusty. Myra sets out to remold them by sexually humiliating Rusty and seducing Mary-Ann. Myra considers it a great success when the shattered Rusty shouts he is &#8220;sick of women.&#8221; Rusty in turn becomes so hostile to Mary-Ann that she announces, &#8220;I&#8217;ll never marry! I hate men!&#8221; Both are now better able to bring Myra&#8217;s vision to their future screen roles. Bisexuality is a double-edge sword, however, and Myra&#8217;s plans are endangered when she finds herself (the part of her still Myron) falling for Mary-Ann. In a related side-plot, casting agent Mae West reverses the casting couch by exploiting aspiring young male actors.In many ways Myra is far in advance of its time. The film looks good, too, which counts for something. Though some critics complain about them, I like the use of classic film clips inserted into the movie; they help set the tone and make the point. (*SPOILER* follows.) While I&#8217;ll in no way argue that this is a misunderstood good movie, my only real personal complaint is the deviation from the ironic ending of the book, in which Mary-Ann marries a surgically re-altered Myron. In the film, treating events as a dream sequence may have simplified bringing the plot to a resolution, but it is altogether too facile to be satisfying.Despite being fictional, Myra (the literary one anyway) in a sense might have had some success. The marriage and birth rates indeed have fallen since 1970 to all-time lows.

571712,A65XH6L5BUX0X,B0000583NW,"TheClassicsNut65 ""morgan miller""","[2, 2]","What is there to say about ""Myra Breckinridge""? This 1970 20th Century-Fox slapstick comedy farce was based on the 1968 best-selling novel of the same title by Gore Vidal. It starred Raquel Welch as the transsexual Myra, Mae West as Leticia Van Allen, John Huston as Buck Loner, Farrah Fawcett as Mary Ann Pringle, Rex Reed as Myron Breckinridge, and Roger Herren as Rusty Godowsky.First, let me clear the questions by saying I did not buy this DVD from Amazon.com, but from my local Dollar General for only $4. On my DVD copy it say the film is rated ""R"" although the movie was originally rated ""X"". It is 94 minutes long and comes with a few exclusive bonus features, including the special and theatrical versions of the movie, as well as the AMC ""Back Story"" documentary on the film.I must also admit that what I heard about this movie prior to my purchase of it, was not good. My grandmother said she remembered seeing it and that it was ""awful"". I also read that the critics called it ""completely unfunny and surely unentertaining"". However, I chose to overlook this all and buy this cult classic.Overall, the acting is poor. You can surely tell the stress and displeasure with most of the performances. You can also tell that Raquel Welch and Mae West did not like each other. (Hello, Mae refused to be seen in the same frame shot with Raquel... and it shows!) I think this movie is a bit confusing: you don't really know if ""Myra"" is real or if ""Myron"" is real, and that is not funny, it is annoying!I think the cast for this film was great! Raquel Welch, Mae West, Farrah Fawcett, Rex Reed, and Roger Herren were perfectly cast! But I also think it would've done better with a better-written script and better director.So, to clear up any confusions, I would not recommend this movie to anyone... unless you are a Raquel Welch fan or a fan of risqu&eacute;, old-fashioned, cult classic movies. I would, however, recommend that you watch the trailer for this movie on YouTube.com. And if you do watch it, listen closely to the part were it says ""Everything you've heard about 'Myra Breckinridge' is true"". On the back of my DVD case if says that the movie is ""Weird. Wild. Sexy. Strange"", but it never says ""Good"". It also says ""Meet Myra Breckinridge. You'll never forget her!"" Yes, we may never forget that ""he/she"", but I think she will leave the wrong impression on you!I hope I was helpful in my review...

So here goes my new method of review.Ahem. Myra Breckinridge is without a doubt the finest contribution to cinema that ever was. It begins in an operation room where our hero is about to get his penis lobbed off. He is in no way sedated, but he's perfectly calm as he begins to croon a little tune to himself, ""Secret place"" ""I've got a secret place, known to none but me/And in my secret place you can beg and torture me!"" A woman in the background is cracking a whip for no apparent reason. Well, after his jimmy is removed the crowd cheers and it's onto the credits.Our hero is know joined by the sexy Raquel Welch and they dance in the street together to a Shirley Temple song. It is a beautiful song, ""You've got to S-M-I-L-E""Now we're given a short monologue that to most people wouldn't make any sense, that's because they're homophobes. And our Heroine(he's no longer a he remember?) ends the monologue with her classic line, ""And don't you ever forget it you mother fu**ers!I don't want to spoil the rest of this beautiful film, but the plot involves our heroine's attempt to take over her uncle's film school. It's filled with sexual hyjinx. At one point an old relic is dug up- Mae West, and she signs that awesome tune of yesteryear-""Sweet little thing let me light your candle""The ""climax"" of this movie involves our heroine strapping on a dildo and taking a young man's manhood. It's a hoot.(and a holler!
