I breathed a heavy sigh of relief when it was finally over.  Seriously, how many different versions of Alexander's Ragtime Band can a person listen to in a single movie and not go insane?Now for the good parts.  The costumes were gorgeous.  The dancers were very talented.  They made complicated steps appear effortless.Overall, the movie was over the top during the musical numbers and weak during the non musical scenes.  The contrast was almost too much to bear.  There are many other musicals that balance the two, but not this one.",2,Pass on this one,1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,632,"['Where', 'do', 'begin', 'First', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'weak', 'movie', 'seemed', 'drag', 'forever', 'breathed', 'heavy', 'sigh', 'relief', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'Seriously', 'how', 'many', 'different', 'versions', 'Alexander', 'Ragtime', 'Band', 'can', 'person', 'listen', 'single', 'movie', 'not', 'go', 'insane', 'Now', 'good', 'parts', 'costumes', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'dancers', 'were', 'very', 'talented', 'made', 'complicated', 'steps', 'appear', 'effortless.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'top', 'musical', 'numbers', 'weak', 'non', 'musical', 'scenes', 'contrast', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'bear', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'musicals', 'balance', 'two', 'not', 'one']",N/A

Although the  songs are excellent Irving Berlin songs, it seems obvious that the story  was built around the songs and not the other way around (This worked for  Singin' in the Rain but did not for There's No Business Like Show  Business.)  Despite a story that is only mildly interesting, there are  several reasons to watch this movie.First, more interesting than the  movie itself is what went on behind the scenes of the filming of the movie.  The relationships between the actors and actresses were strained and that  comes through in the movie.  At the time of filming, Dan Dailey was dating  Donald O'Connor's wife, whom he was separated from at the time.  Marilyn  Monroe was difficult for all the cast to work with because she required her  own costumer and choreographer and was always late.  She thought Donald  O'Connor looked too young to play her love interest despite the fact that  Mr. O'Connor was nine months older than Ms. Monroe (Watch their kiss in the  movie, and see if you pick up on a lack of chemistry.).  At the time of  filming, Ms. Monroe thought that her then husband, Joe Dimaggio, was having  her followed.Second, watch There's No Business Like Show Business for  the wonderful musical numbers performed by Donald O'Connor and Mitzi  Gaynor.  The best number from the entire musical is Donald O'Connor's  &quot;A Man Chases a Girl.&quot;  The number shows off Mr. O'Connor's  singing ability as well as his incredible dancing ability.  I could not  help but be reminded of the &quot;Moses&quot; number from Singin' in the  Rain (in my opinion, the best tap dance number ever).  Mitzi Gaynor, one of  the most underrated dancers of the musical era, is exceptional when she  performs with Mr. O'Connor, singing &quot;Alabam,&quot; (Her Ethel Merman  impersonation is right on.) and &quot;Lazy,&quot; and later with Ms.  Merman, singing &quot;Tatooed.&quot;  It is Mr. O'Connor's and Ms. Gaynor's  numbers that really make the musical worth watching.Finally, watch the  movie for Ms. Monroe's sultry &quot;After You Get What You Want&quot; and  &quot;Heat Wave&quot; numbers.  I am not a Marilyn fan, but I can  understand why so many people were then and why so many people are today as  well.  She definitely knew how to sell a song as well as herself.",3,Not A Great Musical But Definitely Worth Watching,967334400,"08 27, 2000",2000,2417,"['Business', 'Show', 'Business', 'not', 'there', 'ranks', 'Singin', 'Rain', 'American', 'Paris', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'songs', 'are', 'excellent', 'Irving', 'Berlin', 'songs', 'obvious', 'story', 'was', 'built', 'songs', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'worked', 'Singin', 'Rain', 'did', 'not', 'Business', 'Show', 'Business', 'story', 'only', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'watch', 'movie.First', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'what', 'went', 'scenes', 'filming', 'movie', 'relationships', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'strained', 'through', 'movie', 'time', 'filming', 'Dan', 'Dailey', 'was', 'dating', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'wife', 'whom', 'was', 'separated', 'time', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'was', 'difficult', 'cast', 'work', 'required', 'own', 'costumer', 'choreographer', 'was', 'always', 'late', 'thought', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'looked', 'too', 'young', 'play', 'love', 'interest', 'fact', 'Mr.', ""O'Connor"", 'was', 'nine', 'months', 'older', 'Ms.', 'Monroe', 'Watch', 'kiss', 'movie', 'see', 'pick', 'up', 'lack', 'chemistry.', 'time', 'filming', 'Ms.', 'Monroe', 'thought', 'then', 'husband', 'Joe', 'Dimaggio', 'was', 'having', 'followed.Second', 'watch', 'Business', 'Show', 'Business', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'numbers', 'performed', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'best', 'number', 'entire', 'musical', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'quot', 'A', 'Man', 'Girl.', 'quot', 'number', 'Mr.', ""O'Connor"", 'singing', 'ability', 'as', 'well', 'incredible', 'dancing', 'ability', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'reminded', 'quot', 'Moses', 'quot', 'number', 'Singin', 'Rain', 'opinion', 'best', 'tap', 'dance', 'number', 'ever', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'dancers', 'musical', 'era', 'exceptional', 'when', 'Mr.', ""O'Connor"", 'singing', 'quot', 'Alabam', 'quot', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'impersonation', 'right', 'quot', 'Lazy', 'quot', 'later', 'Ms.', 'Merman', 'singing', 'quot', 'Tatooed.', 'quot', 'Mr.', ""O'Connor"", 'Ms.', 'Gaynor', 'numbers', 'really', 'make', 'musical', 'worth', 'watching.Finally', 'watch', 'movie', 'Ms.', 'Monroe', 'sultry', 'quot', 'Get', 'What', 'Want', 'quot', 'quot', 'Heat', 'Wave', 'quot', 'numbers', 'am', 'not', 'Marilyn', 'fan', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'then', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'today', 'well', 'definitely', 'knew', 'how', 'sell', 'song', 'as', 'well', 'herself']",N/A

244593,A3BIWTN2DA0YY2,6301066642,Antoinette Klein,"[36, 37]","I love musicals and this one has been a favorite since it first came out in 1954.  I was thrilled to receive the DVD and even more thrilled to find that the songs and dances were still as wonderful as I remembered, the production numbers still as splendid, and the total show as remarkable as ever.Dan Dailey and Ethel Merman are Terry and Molly Donahue, vaudeville performers circa 1919 when the movie opens.  They quickly add children Steve (Johnnie Ray) Katy (Mitzi Gaynor) and Tim (Donald O'Connor) to the act as each child is old enough to wobble on stage.  They become the successful act known as The Five Donahues and tour constantly even as vaudeville dies away.  When their paths cross with an ambitious blonde named Vicky (Marilyn Monroe) things are never the same.  She breaks Tim's heart and he spirals downward into an alcoholic haze, son Steve leaves the act when he decides to become a priest, and Broadway replaces vaudeville as the elder Donahues spend less time on stage and more time in their New Jersey home.  The ending always leaves me dissolved in tears, but it is the lavish production numbers that make this a favorite.  From the catchy opening of Merman and Dailey performing ""When That Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam'"" (later reprised by Gaynor and O'Connor) to the lavish staging of ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" and the uplifting closing of the title song, this movie is a feast for fans of music and dance. Even though Marilyn Monroe shines in her sexy ""Heat Wave"" number, the long-legged Dailey makes dancing an effortless joy throughout and Merman's voice is uncommonly rich, it is Donald O'Connor and Mitzi Gaynor who enthusiastically dance their way into your heart and steal every scene they are in.",5,Dazzling Production and Masterful Show Tunes Make This A Favorite,1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,1737,"['love', 'musicals', 'one', 'been', 'favorite', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1954', 'was', 'thrilled', 'receive', 'DVD', 'even', 'more', 'thrilled', 'find', 'songs', 'dances', 'were', 'still', 'as', 'wonderful', 'remembered', 'production', 'numbers', 'still', 'splendid', 'total', 'show', 'as', 'remarkable', 'ever.Dan', 'Dailey', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'are', 'Terry', 'Molly', 'Donahue', 'vaudeville', 'performers', 'circa', '1919', 'when', 'movie', 'quickly', 'add', 'children', 'Steve', 'Johnnie', 'Ray', 'Katy', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'Tim', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'act', 'child', 'old', 'enough', 'wobble', 'stage', 'become', 'successful', 'act', 'known', 'Five', 'Donahues', 'tour', 'constantly', 'even', 'vaudeville', 'away', 'When', 'paths', 'cross', 'ambitious', 'blonde', 'named', 'Vicky', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'same', 'Tim', 'heart', 'downward', 'alcoholic', 'haze', 'son', 'Steve', 'act', 'when', 'become', 'priest', 'Broadway', 'replaces', 'vaudeville', 'elder', 'Donahues', 'spend', 'less', 'time', 'stage', 'more', 'time', 'New', 'Jersey', 'home', 'ending', 'always', 'dissolved', 'tears', 'lavish', 'production', 'numbers', 'make', 'favorite', 'catchy', 'opening', 'Merman', 'Dailey', 'performing', 'When', 'Midnight', 'Choo-Choo', 'Leaves', 'Alabam', 'later', 'reprised', 'Gaynor', ""O'Connor"", 'lavish', 'staging', 'Alexander', 'Ragtime', 'Band', 'uplifting', 'closing', 'title', 'song', 'movie', 'feast', 'fans', 'music', 'dance', 'Even', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'shines', 'sexy', 'Heat', 'Wave', 'number', 'long-legged', 'Dailey', 'dancing', 'effortless', 'joy', 'Merman', 'voice', 'uncommonly', 'rich', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'who', 'enthusiastically', 'dance', 'way', 'heart', 'steal', 'scene', 'are']",N/A

244601,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6301066642,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[13, 21]","Opening text:  ""Back in 1919, Vaudeville was a very big part of Show Business.  Our story is about the Donahues, a very little part of Vaudeville.""Yes, the trials and triumphs of the Donahues are examined from 1919 to World War II.  They go from being the Two Donahues to The Five Donahues, with variances inbetween.  There are the parents, Molly and Terrance, and their three offspring, Steven, Katy, and Tim, whose adult careers are also covered.However, the real drama involves the two sons.  Steven decides to become a priest, which upsets the father.  However, his mother and Katy are supportive.  It's all a matter of perspective.  For Steve, it's a change in venue, only the church has had a pretty long run.  Tim becomes romantically involved with aspiring blonde singer Vicky Parker, played by (guess who?)  and runs into all sorts of ups and downs.  However, he gets jealous when he suspects he's having an affair with the producer, Lew Harris.The musical numbers vary from extravagant and splashy to simplistic, and it's the latter that play better, such as the ""Lazy"" number featuring Monroe, Gaynor, and O'Connor.  However, the ""Heat Wave"" number, with Latin rhythms fused with the usual big band stuff and MM's hot costume, is a highlight.  And the lengthy ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" may offend those of German, French, and Scottish ancestry who don't like this glossy cariacaturing of their ethnicity, i.e. costumes and bogus accents.  Still, the bright colours are praiseworthy.The interractions between Ethel Merman and Dan Dailey work the best, as the parents who want the best for their children and struggle.  At one point, they buy a house in Jersey, but what a time for a mortgage, especially during the Depression.  Most people gave up the theatre, with the theatres in turn giving up the Donahues.As for MM, she sings three solo numbers, ""After You Get What You Want You Don't Want It"", the languid ""Lazy"", and the scorching ""Heat Wave"", which has her in a suggestive costume, black and white on the outside, red on the inside, with a full open skirt revealing her underthings.  She felt denigrated by the number, upset, saying, ""I did what they said and all it got me was a lot of abuse...Big breasts, big a--, big deal.  Can't I be anything else?  The dance people kept making me flash the skirt wide open and jump around like I had a fever...it was ridiculous.""This would be the last time MM would play a supporting role in a picture.  The reason was 20th Century Fox, which agreed to give her the starring role in The Seven Year Itch if she did this movie.  For this reason, the natural stars of the show are Ethel Merman and Donald O'Connor, two years after he made it big in Singin' In The Rain.  Merman plays her usual brassy self--after all, as Dan Dailey tells her, she isn't exactly Whispering Jack Smith.However, Mitzi Gaynor (Katy) is the real one to watch.  Four years away from her biggest hit, South Pacific, she's more congenial and lovable than Monroe in this picture, and her graceful and slender figure is an asset.

The movie dives right into the  life and times of ""the Donahues"" -- the show biz family to end all show biz families. It's unintentionally hysterical, shocking, wild, big, bizarre... for me it really ran straight down the list of adjectives from Capital ""A!"" to triple ZZZ! Everything big, bright, fizzy, funny, fine!First: I never really appreciated Marilyn Monroe till I saw her in this movie. She was (perhaps is) the hottest woman on earth! In her ""Heat Wave"" song she suddenly kisses one of the dancers. It didn't seem choreographed. It was incredibly hot. The woman was all curves, an endless flowing river of sensuality. Sorry, Madonna, you are a pale, poor imitation. Marilyn had the goods: the looks, the voice, the sex appeal. She is so much fun just to watch. ""Heat Wave"" must have been conceived after someone ingested heavy drugs and washed them down with Jamaican rum.Ethel Merman was the original Bette Midler. Big, brassy, ballsy. Every song has to be big, giant, pounding, loud! She's just so much fun to watch. Some of her costumes are eyeball shattering. The night of Marilyn's big Broadway show, she's dressed in this raging pink rose valentine coral shimmering chiffon nightmare. Girl, who dressed you! What a statement! What a concept!Donald O'Connor was such a fabu dancer -- they do this whole ""fountain"" number, obviously in an attempt to recreate ""Singin' in the Rain"" -- Don was such a pleasure to watch and he and Marilyn have one sizzling kiss. Wow, how did he keep it in his pants!Mitzi... the woman just lit up the screen. Big, better, best! Tapping, twirling, high kix --the girl had it all.And Dan Dailey... Mr. Vaudeville. The man had to do it all -- Mr. Show Biz Dad! He taps, he sings, he acts, he cries. Wow!His best moment is when he ""returns"" from looking for Don (after a year)... wearin' the same ol' hat, coat and tie that he left home in!And then... the final number! How much bigger could they make it!  If they could have only shot it like they shoot music videos today, it would have been a defining moment in musical movies.Three things to note that I found bizarre: Marilyn sings ""Lazy"" -- a pointless waste of time song that did not benefit her, Donald or Mitzi. When she sang it, she kept pronouncing the ""zee"" as ""gi"" as in ""Gigi."" Why? Who the hell knows.Then, Johnnie Ray, who only seemed to come alive when he sang: His song ""I Believe"" was questionable at best, and his performance is from some other solar system. He does not look like he is a member of the human race.  He is alternately fascinating, bizarre, riveting and disturbing.And... why did they have to make Johnnie decide to be a priest? It was clear to ME why he decided to do it, but what was the point for the film?Anyway, it's all a big barrel of everything that could be stuffed into it, but finally, just to see Ethel sing ""There's No Business..."" is somethin' to behold.Altogether, a wild, wild insane ride.

Ethel Merman and Dan Dailey play a couple of vaudeville stars, the Donahues. Their offspring join them in the act when young, but the film is about what happens when they grow up and start out on careers of their own. Johnny Ray, in his only film role, decides to go into the priesthood, which is a bit of a shock for mum and dad. Donald O'Connor has a bit of a battle with alcohol but still manages to dance up a storm in `A man chases a girl'. His paramour is a showgirl played by Marilyn Monroe, who gives a scorching version of `Heat wave', proving that she can both sing and dance as well as look sexy. In `Lazy' she is joined by O'Connor and Mitzi Gaynor, who is the least troubled or troublesome of the Donahue children. Other Berlin numbers, besides the title song, include `A pretty girl is like a melody' (the Donahue parents), `Alexander's ragtime band' and `When the midnight choo-choo leaves for Alabam' (sung by the whole family), `If you believe' (Johnny Ray's solo piece), `Remember' and other numbers.

It does have a few slow  momments, but it entertains.  I also thought that Donald O'Conner and  Johnny Ray were very good too.  O'Connor was a good dancer and shows his  stuff in this film.

244607,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6301066642,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 3]","THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS isn't a classic. It runs at almost two hours long. If you were to trim off all the Irving Berlin songs, the running time'll get cut down to maybe an hour and a half. This would still be too long for the very thin screenplay. But I guess this is one of those films that you may get into despite the skimpy storytelling, the shallow character development, and the corn. More on that in a bit.This musical tracks the ups and downs of a family of lifelong vaudevillians, the Donahues, from 1919 to just when the second world war was looming. The movie gives us a peek at what goes on backstage in the life of a Broadway entertainer, except that we've seen all this stuff before. If behind the scenes stuff is what you came to this movie for, I say, instead, go check out YANKEE DOODLE DANDY or even THE CHORUS LINE. THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS boasts an all-star ensemble cast, except that nowadays the only name folks will really recognize is Marilyn Monroe's. But then she's an all-time star.Me, I've always had a lukewarm reaction to Dan Dailey and Mitzi Gaynor. They're okay, they don't thrill me. And Ethel Merman's big brassy voice makes for an effective fire alarm. Dan Dailey and Ethel Merman play the patriarch and matriarch of the Donahue clan. The kids, when grown up, are played by Donald O'Connor, Mitzi Gaynor, and that forgotten crooner Johnnie Ray. I'm a fan of O'Connor, who was affable and talented and should've gotten more breaks in the biz. He's one of the reasons I don't mind tuning in to this film. Mitzi Gaynor isn't given much to do, and so doesn't do much. But she's a good sport about it. Johnnie Ray is painful to watch when he's singing because it always looks like he's going into life-threatening convulsions. Thankfully, his character is soon entering priesthood and he's exit stage left for most of the film. Actually, his decision to become a priest provides one of the few real dramatic moments, the other one popping up near the end of the film as the father and son characters played by Dailey and O'Connor become estranged. These two are really good in this one scene in which Papa Donahue slaps the hell out of his always fouling-up kid.There are three hundred and seven songs in this movie, or it feels like it. The name above the movie title says Irving Berlin, and he spoon feeds the audience with his lyrics and music, and some of the songs do qualify as classic standards. But some do not. I could've done without the sailor tattoo song, for instance. And I wish the ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" number hadn't run for 8 and a half minutes. What makes it worse is that O'Connor, in the only goof he makes, sings his part in a friggin' Scottish accent. But he makes up for it later in his big Astaire/Kelly moment with ""A Man Chases A Girl (Until She Catches Him).""What makes the movie worth watching? There are reasons. It's shot in CinemaScope, for one thing and this lends the story a grand theatrical feel, especially if you dig those old slices of musical Americana. Donald O'Connor is a light and entertaining performer. There are several wonderful musical numbers like the above-mentioned ""A Man Chases A Girl."" But, for my money, the best reason is Marilyn Monroe. Word is that she didn't even want to do this movie. But she was then promised the lead role in THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH, and so she came in in her supporting role and right away pushed Ethel Merman off the spotlight.Marilyn Monroe's three musical numbers are the best musical numbers in the film, and ""Heat Wave"" blows everything off the water. In that song Marilyn Monroe, in a dressed-up bikini, delivers what is probably the most provocative weather report ever. She sizzles in ""After You Get What You Want, You Don't Want It"" and is sexily languid in ""Lazy,"" with O'Connor and Gaynor dancing a lighthearted counterpoint. It's interesting that Mitzi Gaynor, a lovely woman and a fine dancer, fades in the background whenever Marilyn shares the scene with her. That's how potent Marilyn's presence is. If you don't have time to sit thru two hours of sentimental hokum, I suggest you fast forward to Marilyn's three musical numbers. Definitely check out ""Heat Wave.""The DVD's bonus features suck and include three theatrical trailers for the film (one of them Portuguese, with the movie title changed to ""O Mundo da Fantasia""); a side-by-side restoration comparison - a 77 second piece featuring a scene as seen thru the Original Film Restoration versus the Original Film Restoration Plus Video Restoration and then the same scene as seen thru the Previous Video Master versus the Original Film Restoration plus Video Restoration; trailers for BUS STOP, GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES, HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE and THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH, as well as a segment promoting Marilyn Monroe's DVD Diamond Collection as a whole; and an image of the movie poster.

The Theater Marquee read: ""MARILYN MONROE (In Huge Letters) in (Second Line) There's no business like Show Business with (Third Line) Ethel Merman, Donald O'Connor, Dan Dailey, Mitzi Gaynor and Johnny Rae. That's how big a movie star Monroe was at the time. I've never seen anyone draw crowds like MM in the 1950's.Monroe's musical numbers were ""After you get what you want you don't want it"" in which she entered wearing a tight evening gown which had a flesh colored undergarment and starburst spangles covering the strategic areas. Marilyn apeared to be nude under the starbursts, even though she wasn't.A little later, she sang ""Tropical Heat Wave"" dressed in a sort of bikini with a little belt covering her navel. This was jaw-droppping to a nine-year-old kid in 1955!Marylin's musical performances were considered lewd and vulgar in 1955. Actually, she wouldn't have been powerful enough to choose her own songs and costumes but she sure did know how to sell sex! Seen recently on TCM, it's all rather tame and yet, what I remember most were her scenes with Donald O'Connor in the quieter moments. You couldn't help but like her. There was a genuine sweetness about the girl. You knew she coulnd't be the cruel seductress she's been made out to be.Recently, I revisited this film on TCM figuring I'd leave it on until I grew tired of it. I watched it all the way through and loved every minute of it.Ethel Merman was the undisputed Queen of Broadway but had never made a big splash in movies. Ethel is wonderful here, never sounding or looking better. I think it's her best film. It's a shame she did not get to immortalize Mama Rose in Gypsy.The underated Dan Dailey was a good choice for her husband.Gorgeous Mitzi Gaynor is their daughter and although Fox was really promoting MM, Mitzi takes no prisoners in the looks and talent department. Can you belive that Mitzi still looks much as she did way back when.Donald O'Connor is Ethel and Dan's youngest son, in love with Monroe. Unfortunately there would be fewer and fewer screen musicals as the years went on thereby shortening the screen careers of O'Connor and Gaynor (And, no, I haven't forgotten South Pacific with Mitzi).Johnny Ray is the only bore in this movie, but, at the time, pre-Elvis, Johnny was the nation's hottest new recording artist. When he sings, take a bathroom break or get a snack.There is so much color and music, the picture seems to spill out of the screen. It will engulf you in song and dance from an earlier era.It's a classic.",5,MARILYN MONROE... and company,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,2579,"['remember', 'going', 'see', 'movies', 'little', 'boy', 'Theater', 'Marquee', 'read', 'MARILYN', 'MONROE', 'Huge', 'Letters', 'Second', 'Line', 'business', 'Show', 'Business', 'Third', 'Line', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'Dan', 'Dailey', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'Johnny', 'Rae', 'how', 'big', 'movie', 'star', 'Monroe', 'was', 'time', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anyone', 'draw', 'crowds', 'MM', ""1950's.Monroe"", 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'entered', 'wearing', 'tight', 'evening', 'gown', 'had', 'flesh', 'colored', 'undergarment', 'starburst', 'spangles', 'covering', 'strategic', 'areas', 'Marilyn', 'apeared', 'be', 'nude', 'starbursts', 'even', 'little', 'later', 'sang', 'Tropical', 'Heat', 'Wave', 'dressed', 'sort', 'bikini', 'little', 'belt', 'covering', 'navel', 'was', 'jaw-droppping', 'nine-year-old', 'kid', '1955', 'Marylin', 'musical', 'performances', 'were', 'considered', 'lewd', 'vulgar', '1955', 'Actually', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'powerful', 'enough', 'choose', 'own', 'songs', 'costumes', 'sure', 'did', 'know', 'how', 'sell', 'sex', 'Seen', 'recently', 'TCM', 'rather', 'tame', 'yet', 'what', 'remember', 'most', 'were', 'scenes', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'quieter', 'moments', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'was', 'genuine', 'sweetness', 'girl', 'knew', ""coulnd't"", 'be', 'cruel', 'seductress', 'been', 'made', 'out', 'be.Recently', 'revisited', 'film', 'TCM', 'figuring', ""'d"", 'leave', 'grew', 'tired', 'watched', 'way', 'loved', 'minute', 'it.Ethel', 'Merman', 'was', 'undisputed', 'Queen', 'Broadway', 'had', 'never', 'made', 'big', 'splash', 'movies', 'Ethel', 'wonderful', 'here', 'never', 'sounding', 'looking', 'better', 'think', 'best', 'film', 'shame', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'immortalize', 'Mama', 'Rose', 'Gypsy.The', 'underated', 'Dan', 'Dailey', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'husband.Gorgeous', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'daughter', 'Fox', 'was', 'really', 'promoting', 'MM', 'Mitzi', 'prisoners', 'looks', 'talent', 'department', 'Can', 'belive', 'Mitzi', 'still', 'much', 'did', 'way', 'back', 'when.Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'Ethel', 'Dan', 'youngest', 'son', 'love', 'Monroe', 'Unfortunately', 'would', 'be', 'fewer', 'fewer', 'screen', 'musicals', 'years', 'went', 'thereby', 'shortening', 'screen', 'careers', ""O'Connor"", 'Gaynor', 'have', ""n't"", 'forgotten', 'South', 'Pacific', 'Mitzi', '.Johnny', 'Ray', 'only', 'bore', 'movie', 'time', 'pre-Elvis', 'Johnny', 'was', 'nation', 'hottest', 'new', 'recording', 'artist', 'When', 'take', 'bathroom', 'break', 'get', 'snack.There', 'so', 'much', 'color', 'music', 'picture', 'spill', 'screen', 'will', 'engulf', 'song', 'dance', 'earlier', 'era.It', 'classic']",N/A

Molly and Terry narrate throughout the story, so the movie actually spans 20 years of their lives. The film starts out with a little song and dance number, and the introduction of Donahue kid #1, then it moves through #2 and #3 and their childhoods with some great comic scenes between Ethel Merman and Dan Dailey. Finally, with the kids all grown up, the family becomes an act called the Five Donahues. The first time you get to see the grown up Donahue children is in a big number called &quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band&quot; in which all the family members get to spotlight their individual talents.  That night, after the show of course, Steve (the oldest) gets his true calling and Vicky Parker (Marilyn Monroe)enters as Tim's (Donald O'Connor)love interest, both events conspiring to break the act up.  This film is filled with plenty of song and dance numbers, almost all of which were written specifically for the movie by Irving Berlin, plenty of talent, and plenty of fun. Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey, and Donald O'Connor are great comedic talents who deliver quite a few laughs throughout, as well as doing a great job with the singing and dancing. I highly recommend this movie to everyone out there who needs a good laugh!

244626,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6301066642,Reviewer,"[5, 23]","The problem with trying to describe this movie is coming up with the right adjectives.  Words like flashy, colorful, gaudy and flat keep coming to mind; but the essential fault with ""There's No Business Like Show Business,"" directed by Walter Lang, can best be summed up by borrowing a line or two from Ernest L. Thayer's immortal poem, ""Casey At the Bat,"" which ends with the lines, ""But there is no joy in Mudville, Mighty Casey has struck out.""  Because, what this movie lacks-- and it's hard to fathom why-- is joy.  Like Casey, it strikes out, big time.  And it's a shame.  It's like having all of the resources to construct the most magnificent building the world has ever seen, including the greatest architects available, and the contractor ends up with a hut a child could've made out of tinker toys.  There's a story here, of course, but it's obvious that the main intention of the project was to showcase the talents of the stars and some very mediocre songs by Irving Berlin, and to dazzle the audience by filling the wide screen with brilliant, colorful images (CinemaScope was the latest, greatest rage at the time, and the studios wanted to make the most of this revolutionary technological advancement).  Someone should have reminded the filmmakers that what they were filling that screen with counted, as well.The story begins in 1919, whereupon we are introduced to the Vaudeville team of Molly and Terence Donahue (Ethel Merman and Dan Dailey).  The next few years are touched upon briefly as Molly and Terry add three children to their family, as well as their act; the toddlers hit the stage with mom and dad almost as soon as they make their entrance into the world.  The story begins in earnest when the youngest Donahues hit legal age, or there abouts.  ""The Five Donahues"" include eldest son, Steve (Johnnie Ray), daughter Katy (Mitzi Gaynor) and the youngest, Tim (Donald O'Connor).  They get bookings and do shows, and eventually cross paths with a wanna-be performer, hat check girl Vicky (Marilyn Monroe) who, after Tim falls hard for her, gets her big break and begins her rise to fame.  The road for all concerned is not smooth, of course, but not to worry-- there's plenty of singing and dancing to go around, and meanwhile Steve surprises everyone with a personal life choice, Tim falls into a jealous funk and Katy meets the handsome Charles Biggs (Hugh O'Brian).  And along the way, Molly and Terry find out what parents have known since the beginning of time:  Raising kids is no picnic.  But at least they have singing and dancing and singing and...For the first fifteen minutes or so of the film-- or maybe longer; it seems MUCH longer-- we are ""treated"" to Molly and Terry's Vaudeville act.  And about five minutes of Merman's singing should be enough for anyone; her voice fairly grates on the senses.  After this extended opening the film moves along, but seems flat and stays that way until Monroe makes her entrance.  Once she's on, the screen belongs to her; but it's still not enough to save the day.  She does, however, contribute the single memorable number to the show, ""We're Havin' A Heat Wave.""  But her ""Lazy"" number is just that, and not even the contributions of O'Connor and Gaynor can help it.The production numbers suffer from poor staging, uninspired choreography and some of the worst costumes you're likely to ever find in a movie.  Even the best song the film has to offer, ""Alexander's Ragtime Band,"" (done terrifically by Alice Faye in the movie of that title) is terribly abused here, presented in a lengthy and contrived manner that is beyond repair.  Even ""Heat Wave"" was saved only because of Monroe, whose sensuous delivery outweighs the actual blandness of the number.  And the costumes for the grand finale, especially, are embarrassingly ridiculous (and quickly take the ""grand"" out of it)-- particularly the white dress Merman wears while delivering the title song; a creation so horrendous it defies description.  Overall, it's a sad commentary on the lack of originality and quality of the film when the likes of Monroe, Gaynor and especially O'Connor can't even save it, even though individually and collectively they do have their moments; the problem is those moments are just too few and far between.The one believable aspect of the film is the casting of Merman as a Vaudeville star; and after seeing her ""act,"" there is no longer any mystery as to what killed Vaudeville.  If this is a sample of the real thing, talking pictures had nothing to do with it's demise.  It simply inevitably imploded.  The burning question that remains is, how in the world did Ethel Merman ever become a star?  And what about Johnnie Ray?  A relatively successful recording artist with a unique style, he was nevertheless dreadfully miscast in this film.  Frequently asked why he made only this one movie, he would reply, ""Because I was never asked to do another one.""  Which is quite understandable; he could sing, but he simply could not act.  And it's hard to discern whether it was just the part or his acting that made his character seem so ludicrous.The supporting cast includes Richard Eastham (Harris), Frank McHugh (Eddie), Rhys Williams (Father Dineen) and Lee Patrick (Marge).  With a cast including the likes of O'Connor, Monroe and Gaynor, and with songs by Berlin, ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" inherently promises great things, but fails to deliver.  There's no getting around the fact that in the end it's a lackluster, forgettable contribution to a genre known for liveliness and joy.  Not the least bit satisfying, it is perhaps the biggest misfire in the history of movie musicals.  And it leaves you with a single, burning question that demands to be asked:  Where's Gene Kelly when you need him?",2,Now We Know What Really Happened To Vaudeville,1009756800,"12 31,

Marilyn Monroe, while amply represented in the movie as Vicky Carter (an upwardly mobile showtunes dreamer who ends up finding wild success), does not dominate or overshadow the film.  The film is actually filled out by several actors, most whom play as The Donahue family (with Ethel Merman as the matriarchal Donahue), a family beating down the train stations and airports as a musical traveling family in the waning days of vaudeville.  This is a musical and there is a lot of singing, including the pathos portions, as well as just noise, noise, noise.  Sure, it shows a side of life some are familiar with but the movie was just noisy.  As the Donahue's children begin to go their own ways a family crisis occurs when son Tim (played by a snappy and obviously talented Donald O'Connor) drinks a bit too much and absconds to whereabouts unknown after a rueful, semantic fisticuff with father.  The family is united in their concern over son/ brother and all is not-so-neatly tied up in the end when he comes back to the fold.  The well-known show-stopper ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" is belted out just like you're familiar with by Ethel Merman who shows talent for more than just singing throughout the film.

244643,AY8WZDYR79GFV,6301066642,Yasha Banana,"[1, 3]","If you don't love this movie, if you don't *adore* this movie -- well then, by gosh by golly, you're un-American.And if you're French, you're un-French.And if you're Hungarian, you're un-Hungarian.(Catch my drift?)This movie next to ""Singin' in the Rain"" is like Babe Ruth next to Lou Gehrig in the Yankee lineup.  It's just great.Everybody in the movie shines.  Even poor Johnnie Ray.  I mean, what was the idea there?  I suppose the producers figured that if every kid who bought a Johnnie Ray record came to the movie they'd make millions.Johnnie Ray proves a theory of mine, that is: if the people who are making a filmare convinced they have a hit, they'll throw in a really bad, no-talent actor in the movie  -- for example, Cybil Shepherd in ""Taxi Driver"" or Troy Donahue in ""Godfather Two"" or George Hamilton in ""Godfather Three"" -- as a way of saying to the audience: ""See, this movie is so good that it can shine even with this lousy actor in it.""In other words, it makes everyone else, by comparison, look even better.This movie also proves, at least for me, that Donald O'Connor is a much better, much more entertaining talent than either Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire.  Both those guys were way too studied, way too self-conscious in their performances.  Not that they weren't great talents, but Donald O'Connor has an ""approachability"" that both of them lacked.  The same is true of Mitzi Gaynor.  They engage the camera in a very amiable, spontaneous way.You look at Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire and you say: ""Gee, I could never do that.""  Whereas you look at Donald O'Connor or Mitzi Gaynor and you say to yourself: ""Gee, it would be fun dancing with them.  I bet they'd be willing to show me how.  I bet they'd be interesting to talk to.""Personally, I never felt that about Kelly or Astaire: that they were approachable.I think there's something about film acting whereby approachability is a key factor in an actor's popularity.  I think it has to do with the fact that after you see someone in a movie you like you go to the Internet and you want to find out about them, professionally and personally.Some actors are so talented -- for example, Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire --that even though they may lack ""approachability,"" their talent is so great that the audience can't deny them their attention.  And then there are performers such as, say, Donald O'Connor or Dean Martin or Jimmy Durante who are immediately likeable.  The audience adores them!It was said that Donald O'Connor didn't get along with Gene Kelly on the set of ""Singin' in the Rain"" because Kelly, as co-director of the movie with Stanley Doneen, was such a tyrant -- and this comes across in Kelly's performances.  Whereas it's impossible to believe that Donald O'Connor was, in real life, anything but what you see on the screen.Also, come on now -- dancing is supposed to be fun! -- and Donald O'Connor compared to either Kelly or Astaire looks like he's having much more fun than those two over rehearsed, slick-haired smoothies.As for Marilyn Monroe. ... Now we speak of a force of nature. ... If you want to understand what there was about Marilyn Monroe that's so special, consider the beginning of her number ""After You Get What You Want.""  She begins by coming onto a nightclub stage and, going from table to table, she flirts with the various male customers in the audience.  Now, when you're watching the pieces of business Marilyn does with the male customers, ask yourself: ""What other female singer/dancer could do that like Marilyn does it?""  Bette Grable?  No.  Rita Hayworth?  No.  Jane Russell?  No.Marilyn Monroe could instantaneously ingratiate herself to an audience.  As in the comparison between Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor, or Fred Astaire and, say, Jimmy Durante, she doesn't have the edge or the hardness of a Jane Russell or a Rita Hayworth.  When she's flirting with the extras in the nightclub, she's flirting with all the guys who are watching the movie.  While, at the same time, the women in the audience, not jealous or competitive (I suspect), open up their heart to her.You immediately feel her presence.  Even on a television screen! ... You can imagine what the reaction of an audience was seeing her towering above them on a movie screen.Towards the end of the movie she comes onscreen in the middle -- in the *middle*! --of an extravagantly-staged finale, and she immediately revs up the already sky-high energy of the scene.It's technically and metaphysically impossible for anyone in a movie to steal a scene from Marilyn Monroe.  In her best films, she owns the camera.  And ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" is, quite likely, the pinnacle of her professional and personal life.  What happened afterwards is, quite simply, an American tragedy.Presumably Marilyn Monroe was just as ambitious, just as single-minded, just as tenacious in her quest, in her struggle for fame and fortune as Bette Grable or Jane Russell or Rita Hayworth; but the difference between Marilyn Monroe and those also-rans is that Marilyn Monroe was all heart, all simpatico.  You never saw her ambition.  You never saw her lust for fame.  You never saw her one-mindedness, her toughness, her ""professionalism.""  All you saw was the woman-child.  As Elton John put it: ""The candle in the wind.""When she kisses Donald O'Connor in ""There' No Business Like Show Business"" and kissed Tommy Noonan in ""Gentleman Prefer Blondes"" and kissed ""Tom Ewell in ""Seven Year Itch,"" you see sex itself in a unique way!  In most other actresses hands, ""Seven Year Itch"" would have been nothing more than a male chauvinist yuk, a locker room joke.  Can you think of any modern-day actress who would dare try starring in a remake of ""Seven Year Itch""? ... Angelina Jolie?  Reese Witherspoon? ... Who? ... Nobody.Stars are all around us, but comets are indeed rare.I always felt that what defined Marilyn was the fact that she was not just an orphan but an orphan who before being sent to an orphanage lived with her mother, only to be given up by her mother at about the age of 9.  It was that emotional trauma/vulnerability that was so close to the surface in everything she did.  Put another way: no one else was like Marilyn Monroe because no one else was like Norma Jean Baker.Marilyn Monroe always wanted to do ""serious"" work, and yet the joy and vitality she created onscreen in her musical roles was, in my opinion, a far greater contribution to the harmony and well-being of the human race than any success she might have had as a so-called serious actress.""Tragedy is easy, comedy is hard and love is damn near impossible."" ... I don't know who said that but when I see Marilyn Monroe and she brings joy to my heart, I take exception to the last part of that statement -- I think anything is possible.For all the pain and all the suffering ""The American Empire"" has brought to the world (to the slaves, to the American Indians, to countless Third World countries), still, it shouldn't be forgotten that America also produced people like Marilyn Monroe, and Louis Armstrong, and Babe Ruth, and Billie Holiday, and Charlie Parker.  All life-forces that, while they may not redeem the rest of us, did still walk amongst us.It's interesting that two of Marilyn Monroe's husbands, Joe Di Maggio and Arthur Miller, both lacked a sense of humor.  They were *serious* men; both of whom felt themselves to be inherently superior to Marilyn.By accepting that judgment, Marilyn only added to her woes.  She was, in her work, not only their equal but in many ways far, far more sustaining a life-force.  What, after all, did someone like Van Gogh try to do on a piece of canvas?  Create a vitality, life-force, no?  Excite the viewer.  Engage the observer.  Reveal something about the human condition -- love, longing, sadness.  Perhaps, above all, vulnerability. ... And who did this onscreen better than Marilyn Monroe? ... Who turned her sense of humor into a sense of humanity better than Marilyn Monroe?Sure, her talent was far greater than any of the vehicles Hollywood could come up with for her, but her sheer presence was enough.  She didn't steal scenes from other actors, she blew them away.  As talented as they were, she turned them into props, satellites.And now, in retrospect, knowing her sad fate, she adds yet another dimension to her onscreen presence -- she reminds us of our mortality.Because Marilyn Monroe was not just our Sun-Goddess, the Embodiment of Life.  She was also the Dean of Death.She was Van Gogh's ""Sunflower"" -- but she was also Jack Kerouac's Dean Moriarity, his ""fabulous yellow candle ... mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time.""  Her first song in ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" is entitled ""After You Get What You Want You Don't Want It"" is not only an ironic comment on the tragedy of her life, it's also typically American, isn't it?  Indeed one might say that Marilyn Monroe ushered into the America culture the notion of ""rampant individualism"" -- the all-consuming, demon-loving idea of being ""desirous of everything at the same time.""  This was her undoing and, as it could quite possibly turn out, it may be America's undoing as well.Say goodbye to what you left behind, Marilyn.",5,"Marilyn Monroe - Our ""Fabulous Yellow
