1421104,AMD2LQDWJE0E9,B004NJC0NY,James Lopez,"[26, 40]","I have seen each of the segments of this documentary series.  While I applaud the fact that Henry Louis Gates Jr. is exploring the very significant African roots of Latin America's cultures and people, it presents an interesting question: Who is ""Black"" in Latin America?  For Gates, who comes from the U.S. (where hypodescent and its most extreme form, the ""One Drop Rule,"" were the dominant cultural practices), it is very easy to see who is ""black"" (which would be virtually anyone with visible, or at least likely, African descent); however, ""race"" is not as simple as this in Latin America.  Having a degree of African ancestry, be it slight or highly significant, never relegated people automatically into the ""black"" category in Latin America-- because of this, the black/white ""racial"" dichotomy that exists in the U.S. does not apply to Latin America, and utilizing this template (which is what Gates does throughout the series) gives a very distorted view of ""racial"" relations in Latin America.  This is especially evident in the segment on Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where mixed-identified Dominicans are viewed critically; in contrast, black-identified Haitians are given the tag of having a ""noble"" history and heritage by Gates and are portrayed as being completely victimized by their neighbors in the Dominican Republic, making it obvious who he (Gates) favors and where his biases lie.Its a worthy attempt, but ultimately, it is obvious that Gates does not really understand Latin America, its people, or its culture.  Therefore, his presentation fails because it is coming from a place of biased ignorance.  However, on the plus side, some interesting historical facts are presented, and there is plenty of beautiful imagery and music to be found in the series.",3,"Question: Who is ""Black"" in Latin America?",1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,1787,"['have', 'seen', 'segments', 'documentary', 'series', 'applaud', 'fact', 'Henry', 'Louis', 'Gates', 'Jr.', 'exploring', 'very', 'significant', 'African', 'roots', 'Latin', 'America', 'cultures', 'people', 'interesting', 'question', 'Who', 'Black', 'Latin', 'America', 'Gates', 'who', 'U.S.', 'where', 'hypodescent', 'most', 'extreme', 'form', 'One', 'Drop', 'Rule', 'were', 'dominant', 'cultural', 'practices', 'very', 'easy', 'see', 'who', 'black', 'would', 'be', 'virtually', 'anyone', 'visible', 'least', 'likely', 'African', 'descent', 'however', 'race', 'not', 'as', 'simple', 'Latin', 'America', 'Having', 'degree', 'African', 'ancestry', 'be', 'slight', 'highly', 'significant', 'never', 'relegated', 'people', 'automatically', 'black', 'category', 'Latin', 'America', 'black/white', 'racial', 'dichotomy', 'U.S.', 'not', 'apply', 'Latin', 'America', 'utilizing', 'template', 'what', 'series', 'very', 'distorted', 'view', 'racial', 'relations', 'Latin', 'America', 'especially', 'evident', 'segment', 'Haiti', 'Dominican', 'Republic', 'where', 'mixed-identified', 'Dominicans', 'are', 'viewed', 'critically', 'contrast', 'black-identified', 'Haitians', 'are', 'given', 'tag', 'having', 'noble', 'history', 'heritage', 'Gates', 'are', 'portrayed', 'being', 'completely', 'victimized', 'neighbors', 'Dominican', 'Republic', 'making', 'obvious', 'who', 'Gates', 'favors', 'where', 'lie.Its', 'worthy', 'attempt', 'ultimately', 'obvious', 'not', 'really', 'understand', 'Latin', 'America', 'people', 'culture', 'Therefore', 'presentation', 'coming', 'place', 'biased', 'ignorance', 'However', 'plus', 'side', 'interesting', 'historical', 'facts', 'are', 'presented', 'plenty', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'music', 'be', 'found', 'series']",N/A

1421107,AKR6UK8O6DM6X,B004NJC0NY,"Lemas Mitchell ""Libertarian/ Empiricist""","[4, 13]","Just some very general thoughts, since there is too much to deal with and create a readable review of this generally sorry documentary.1. The first thing that annoyed me to NO END was that he showed black people dancing in every single segment. And yet, there were almost no black people shown holding books or doing anything intellectual. Even among the museum curators, I don't think I counted a single black black person. So, if you want to see a bunch of dancing idiots (and MTV/ BET/ VH1 just doesn't have enough of them), then this documentary should put you over the top.2. The Haiti and Dominican Republic segment was......uncomfortable. On one hand, he showed us DR-- people who don't think of themselves as black and who have built a relatively prosperous country. On the other hand, he showed us Haiti. That is a place where everyone thinks of themselves as black and is an absolutely AWFUL looking place. Gates couldn't be bothered to take us to ONE single nice looking neighborhood. And Haiti is all the more embarrassing, since it has been independent for over 2 centuries and is actually POORER than when it started out. (Gates had some vague excuses about just why this might be so.)3. In the Mexico section, the people flat out told Gates that: a. This is not like the American example; b. Don't try to reinterpret it as that; c. We don't think of ourselves as black (in the sense that American people do). And it was also interesting that the only people that he talked to (and that saw this as a social issue) were people in academia (academics are out of touch everywhere in the world).4. In the Brazilian section Gates ended at a university (again) with some students talking about the *smoldering* social issue of affirmative action. Earlier, he'd mentioned that there was a lot of white immigration in decades past (thereby bringing people with more talent than locals who also happened to be white), but when he noticed that there were more whites in ""better"" jobs/ positions, he automatically defined that as discrimination. From there, he did some pontificating about the necessity for affirmative action (because of course no black person would EVER have done/will do anything or gotten/ will get ANY job without it).5. Would this have been complete without a trip to Cuba? Yes, Gates noted that most of the Cubans that got out were white Cubans and so are the ones that run the country. But then, he mentioned that they were years ahead of the United States. But the question that he didn't ask (and that we weren't meant to ask) was: ""Would you rather have more equal distribution of an income of $1 or less equal distribution of an income of $10?"" I don't see black people from America moving to Cuba to participate in its bounty.6. The most annoying recurring theme:a. Gates (in some country) kept (implicitly) defining all differences in income as due to discrimination.b. Then, he would show some character waffling on about ""we have had equal rights since 18XX.""c. Finally, he would fail to conclude that equal rights/ opportunities don't necessarily lead to equal results.d. He would then take some swipe at the United States (which, incidentally, has a higher per capita income than ALL of the countries that he showed and whose black population has a higher income than those surveyed).I'm just glad that I saw this on Youtube where I didn't have to actually pay for it. I'd think myself ill used if I had.",2,"A silly, strained series.
