865692,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0006FO5IC,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[1, 2]","In season 1 on Penn and Teller: Bulls***, the Vegas duo intelligently, hilariously, and very unobjectively debunked such social myths as ESP, Talking to the Dead, and Bottled Water.  While most of the episodes had easy targets, there were a few things that were a little surprising.  This year, P&T; up the ante by taking on a few more institutions that may not seem like BS at first thought.  The War on Drugs, Recycling, 12-Stepping, and Exercise vs. Genetics are all episodes from this year that I was skeptical about at first, but by the end, could see their point (I didn't finish every episode agreeing with the duo, but they definitely made me think a little bit).  They also did go after some more of the easier recognized BS, like Hypnosis, Tantric Sex, and Safety Hysteria.Now that the show was in its second season, I'm surprised that P&T; could get people to come on the show to argue the other side of the point; surely some of them saw the show and knew that they would only be hurting their cause by appearing.  Yet people kept showing up to try to beat P&T;, and all of them failed.  With a great panel of experts as well as their own wit and intellect, Penn and Teller were able to make even the most rational of their opponents' arguments useless.Once again, all of the episodes were very good, with some being better than others.  This year had the first episode that genuinely scared me, and that was the PETA episode.  The things that some of the members have done in the name of animal rights have been atrocities, and many top-level members were exposed as being very hypocritical.  This year also has my all-time favorite episode, Profanity.  I am convinced that it is half an hour of television that everyone in America should see.

Carl Sagan's The Demon-Haunted World is one of my favorite books, of all time. In short, I am in the choir that surrounds Penn & Teller's pulpit. I love this kind of thing--debunking popular claims with a healthy dose of clear thinking, evidence and reason. I only wish, having watched this season on disc, that Penn & Teller had done a better job of it.It's likely not their fault, but it remains thus: that the series presents topics, such as the existence of fact in the Bible, profanity, New Age mysticism, recycling and P.E.T.A., which are then dealt with (pronounced ""B.S."") in a slickly produced 24-25 minutes (minus the title sequence). The problem is that many of these topics, no matter how much I agree with P&T; on their judgment, are too weighty and subtle to be dealt with effectively in that kind of time frame, and in the manner of the show. There's no way that they can cover it all, and so I'm forced to conclude that, given the time they take and detail they go into, they can only really convince people who were *already convinced*.Also, the slick editing always makes the viewer wonder--are they pulling things out of context? Are they giving the other side ""a fair hearing""? For instance, I whole-heartedly agree that New Age mysticism is tripe, but I cringed to see the folks that P&T; dredged up to defend those beliefs. To really prove the point, in my opinion, you have to be able to debunk/impeach the best-spoken advocates of New Age, not the drugged-out psychos. Because of the format of the show, P&T; are forced to strike quickly for the jugular, which means that, instead of giving us fully reasoned and evidenced positions--a true intellectual back and forth--they give us fringe looneys with a comic voiceover, pointing up the obvious that their opponents don't know what they're saying or how they come across.But still, at least someone is out there making points that desperately need to be made: that ""free speech"" doesn't allow for the FTC regulations; that P.E.T.A. is hypocritical, and devalues human life (by minimizing things like the Holocaust) as it tries to elevate non-human life; that most forms of recycling acutally make pollution worse; and so on.... Whether or not P&T; could convince an intelligent person who initially disagreed with them--and that really should be the goal--or not, maybe at least by raising the subjects, they will inspire people to do more investigating on their own. Maybe they'll get some people to challenge commonly-accepted ideas. Maybe they'll get some people to *think* about what they believe. And that would be very good, indeed.

I don't watch too many TV shows, but this is one that caught my attention from the first season, and continues to be a favorite of mine.What makes this show great is that there's nothing quite like it on the air.  Who better to show the dark underbelly lying behind the lily-white facade of many of the bogus industries out there than the outspoken Penn Jillette and silent but impactful Teller (both of whom also write for the show)?Whether the topic is religion, personal trainers, the funeral industry, free speech, gun control, life coaches or hair management, nothing is safe from setting off Penn & Teller's BS detectors.  And while there are times where some statements may prove to be either incorrect or opinion-based, every episode is both hilarious and educational to some degree (how's that for a combination?).  In addition, while many of the topics would hint at some sort of political agenda, you may find Penn & Teller's stance on another subject to be contradictory to the leanings suggested on another subject - for instance, they are opposed to organized religion, favor the right to bear arms, and are big time free speech advocates (as the show's title perfectly attests to).In summary: Penn & Teller: Bullsh*t! (The Complete Second Season) is a must-buy for anyone who seeks enlightenment and humor in the same place.  While my stance on certain subjects may not change, they have certainly changed my perspective on a plethora of topics.  This show will probably make more enemies than friends for Penn & Teller, but I think they wouldn't have it any other way.

865700,A12W99SK787ZJ9,B0006FO5IC,"J. J. Chiappelli ""jjcx""","[0, 11]","Penn and Teller up the controversy content of their show a thousandfold in the second season.  This is both a good thing and a bad thing.  On the one hand, they mercilessly pursue BS in places like PETA, which truly do fall apart under serious, scientific scrutiny.On the other hand, some episodes are overtly political and are misleading.  While Penn and Teller never report anything that is directly incorrect, they do slip up a few times in this season.  Two examples of what I'm talking about:Profanity - In the profanity episode, P & T debunk the idea that profanity causes social ills.  This is valid.  I am very much a free speech advocate.  I believe that the controversy over things like the Janet Jackson incident is pathetic, given that we're now living in the twenty-first century.  But that's my OPINION on this issue---I can't claim that what I believe is factual.  I can make a factual claim such as, ""Profanity does not cause premarital sex.""  But any claim like, ""Profanity is bad"" or ""Profanity is good"" or ""Free speech is good"" is strictly in the realm of opinion.  So, while I agree wholeheartedly with P & T's points in this episode, I disagree with their presentation.  To me, the episode would have been better if they focused more on debunking outrageous claims that people have made about profanity over the years.  Instead, the episode is about 1/2 debunking, 1/2 ranting.The Business of Love - Here we have P & T making factual statements, but failing to accurately define a word.  That word in question is ""Love.""  Nothing in this episode is really disagreeable---P & T never say that you can't have a monogamous relationship, nor do they ever say that having a monogamous relationship is bad.  All they say is that monogamy is not a natural thing.  And that's fine.  That's factual and we should accept that.But then they take it a step forward and say that ""love"" is a short-term thing that fizzles out after a little while.  The trouble is, ""love"" is a subjective term---who gets to decide what ""love"" is?  I know that, to me, ""love"" refers to the long-term feeling of companionship that a human can feel with another.  Therefore, to say to me that ""love"" is unreal is wrong and offensive---my ""love"" is much different from their ""love.""  This may seem like splitting hairs, but it's an important point: you can't make an objective show if you're using subjective terminology.  You have to define your terms clearly and work with them clearly because otherwise you end up creating unnecessary controversy, shock, and confusion.  The episode suffers because P & T spend much of it trashing ""love.""  You can't just nonchalantly dismiss some abstract concept that everybody views differently.One last complaint is about the DVD release itself.  Seriously, Showtime---what the ****?  The first season had bonus interviews, deleted scenes, outtakes, and slick packaging.  The second season comes in an awkward, flimsy box with a putrid color scheme and absolutely NO SPECIAL FEATURES.  What, you couldn't afford the extra two bucks it would've cost to encode at least a couple of commercials? (Update: it turns out there actually is one or two commercials on the DVD, but you have to hunt for them.  And that's it---no other special features, just a couple of commercials.  I still maintain my previous complaint.)Despite those complaints, though, I still love this season.

865701,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B0006FO5IC,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[63, 70]","Penn and Teller can be abrasive and obnoxious but they are also quite rational and extremely funny. The BS series looks at a wide range of pop culture phenomena and debunks them from a rational point of view. They do so with humor and an intense, biting sarcasm directed at those who would harm others. To those who are merely acting foolishly or exhibiting bad judgment, they are slightly kinder.Some think that the second season is not as good as the first but I disagree. I think it is just as good and I look forward to more episodes next season. Those for this one include the following:PETA- exposing the animal rights organization that would rather have people die than animals; who support arson to free animals; who euthanize 2/3 of the animals they save; who object to medical research and drugs derived from animals except for their high executives.Safety Hysteria- anti terrorist mail order goods, fear of magnetic fields, fear of cell phones, fear of toilets, school violence and some gratuitous nudity from a model are some of the features of this episode. Basically, lots of people make lots of money preying on lots of fears from lots of fools.Business of Love -  consider the proposition that monogamy is unnatural; look at schemes to meet the perfect mate; learn how to hoodwink members of the opposite sex into thinking you a better than you are; learn some of the methods of relationship books and magazines. The bottom line is that some people are looking for love and are miserable and most of the rest are in relationships and...miserable.War on Drugs - This one does not glorify drugs and even makes the point that drugs screw up people's lives. What it does do is question the worth, effectiveness and moral rectitude of  prohibition in general and the war on drugs in particularRecycling - It causes pollution; costs extra and produces inferior products and results. It sounds counterintuitive and wrong. It goes against all of what we are taught  by the popular media, school and ""environmental whackos"" but is it right? This program looks at the possibility that what we are taught is wrong.Profanity - Looks at attempts to suppress profanity. This episode does not ""endorse"" the use of offensive or vulgar language but does question its suppression in a land dedicated to free speech.  Freedom of speech comes with a price...sometimes people say things we don't like.Yoga, Tantric Sex, Etc. - A look a new age psychobabble, this episode explores the proposition that most, if not all, new age trends is the result of a bunch of hippies with an effective capitalistic sense. It does not necessarily trash everything but it is pretty merciless on the mysticism aspect.Fountain of Youth - The lady with all the plastic surgery was frightening in her obsession. The pricetag for all the body work was even more frightening. There are other dodges to ""stay young"". Salad diets, specialized art, human growth hormone, and other tricks are all tried. All of them have a cost and the cash was just the least of it. Real health problems are a big part of it and the loss of dignity might be the worst of all.Death, Inc. - People spend a lot of money on all the stuff that accompanies death. This includes funerals, cemeteries, embalming, and all sorts of bells and whistles. It's a big industry and that means that there are lots of opportunities for profits. That means that there are plenty of opportunites for abuse. There is plenty of opportunity for exposure.12 Stepping - This one was surprising. Twelve step programs are examined with the idea that they are a cult. The claim that that addictions are disease are completely dismissed. They take exception with the religious basis of the programs and from there tend to dismiss them. They do not say that the programs do not work at all but claim that others might be better. Perhaps the most valid point they make is their objection to the compulsory aspects of the programs when people are forced into the programs by the legal system or other authorities.The Bible: Fact or Fiction - This one is nothing new. It pits biblical literalists against agnostics and skeptics. What is left out  are most of the middle roads. The program rightly points out that there are some literal inconsistencies and goes on to try to explain some of them with rational explanations. I'm a clergyman and have no objections at all to these debates but I don't get much out of them either. Faith and theology are poorly equipped to deal with some issues. Science is also poorly equipped to deal with some issues. Both have had some spectacular failures.Exercise vs. Genetics - This one is pretty much a rehash of one of the first season programs. In light of the craze for physical fitness, it looks at all the money and effort that is put into exercise regimens and other means of looking good but if your genetics aren't on the same page, you are doomed. That doesn't mean that exercise is not worthwhile but there is a difference between being healthy and being genetically disposed towards looking like Mr. Universe of a supermodel.Hypnosis - ""One person is talking and another person is going along with it"" That sums up the view of what hypnosis is all about. People do want they are predisposed towards wanting to do. This works even better when they are told to do what they want to do. Self delusion with some friendly but larcenous help is the key.",5,Back in Top Form,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,5415,"['Penn', 'Teller', 'can', 'be', 'abrasive', 'obnoxious', 'are', 'also', 'quite',

While the first season of Bullsh.t was great, this season is greater. The first season focused on obvious whack-jobs like kthose who believe in alien abduction and the mystical power of ouija boards. Yes, it is fun to chuckle at, but you already knew they were nut-jobs before going in.This season focuses on harder and more mainstream beliefs - from belief in hypnosis, yoga, and the 'animal liberation' movement, to belief in the war on drugs, regulation of profanity, and...recycling. These are beleifs that many people believe, and as such, it is harder than in the first season to make some of these 'believers' look blatantly silly.As I mention in my review of the first season, one should not expect anything like a 'thorough' debunking with these shows. It is a half-hour entertainment show, after all. With that said, P and T still do a GREAT job doing what they can in the time they have. Also, as some of the shows debunk moral stances (i.e., avoiding profanity, animal liberation), it is hard to 'debunk' them in any strict sense, though P and T do as good a job as they can laying out good counter-arguments.But first and foremost, this show should be looked at as edutainment.

865705,A1HOLE9R6WPT85,B0006FO5IC,Mad Max,"[29, 48]","I've loved Penn & Teller for years. I like everything else they do. And while BS might be mildly amusing, it fails to accomplish any of the things they are wanting to do.I fully understand --and agree-- with the need to debunk myths in our culture. Heck, 90% of what's in our history books are myth. But Myth Busters & the Amazing Randy, though less edgy, are much better at it.There are 4 fatal flaws with their approach. First, they don't give any method to critique the evidence they are presenting. In the ""Recycling"" episode, for example, Penn & Teller interview three national environmental groups who discuss the need for recycling. Then, they interview one unknown nutty right-wing city college professor, who wrote one article ten years ago about how ineffective recycling is. Their conclusion: he's correct, the three think-tanks are wrong. Huh? How exactly do you weigh these arguments? Don't you have a method to determine whose data is good and whose is bad? This is a non-sequitor, to say the least.Second, they attack individuals, not institutions who spread the myths. In the ""Fountain of Youth"", for example, they poke fun at how youth-obsessed our culture is. Great topic! A lot of feminists and cultural researchers are written about this (The Beauty Myth, Beauty in a Jar, etc). Penn & Teller start out fine... but then miss the point entirely. They end up poking fun at women who have plastic surgery & use botox.Isn't it more effective & more accurate to examine the industries who ""sell"" youthfulness? Aren't there race, class, and gender issues here that you're missing entirely? i.e., Let's say my son's history textbook contains myths & inaccuracies. Why would you waste time ranting about how ignorant he is for reading it. Why wouldn't you go after the publisher (i.e., the one who propogates the myth) instead?Third, they compare apples & bananas. In the yoga episode, they interview three yoga experts who rattle off a dozen advantages to doing yoga. Then they quote one fitness trainer (with no credentials) who says stretching for more than 30 seconds is redundant, therefore, yoga is BS. Huh? What about the other 11 advantages to doing yoga? Like lowering blood pressure, reducing stress, reducing arthritis, etc. Penn & Teller pick just one small facet to ""debunk"", then ignore all the other evidence. Trouble is, they get away with it because they're so entertaining.Last, it's defeatest. Let's stay I buy into their notion that recycling doesn't work. Then what? They don't provide ANY viable alternatives. What do we do about the toxins seeping into the earth & our water supply? How about consuming less, or using environmentally friendly alternatives? If so, what are those alternatives? I laughed during the show, but after watching a few episodes, walked away feeling depressed and hopeless.I give it two stars instead of one because it's entertaining, and we actually get to hear Teller's voice once or twice.",2,"Very disappointing, not convincing",1128384000,"10 4, 2005",2005,2952,"[""'ve"", 'loved', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'years', 'everything', 'else', 'do', 'BS', 'might', 'be', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'accomplish', 'things', 'are', 'wanting', 'do.I', 'fully', 'understand', 'agree', 'need', 'debunk', 'myths', 'culture', 'Heck', '90', '%', 'what', 'history', 'books', 'are', 'myth', 'Myth', 'Busters', 'Amazing', 'Randy', 'though', 'less', 'edgy', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'are', '4', 'fatal', 'flaws', 'approach', 'First', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'method', 'critique', 'evidence', 'are', 'presenting', 'Recycling', 'episode', 'example', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'interview', 'three', 'national', 'environmental', 'groups', 'who', 'discuss', 'need', 'recycling', 'Then', 'interview', 'one', 'unknown', 'nutty', 'right-wing', 'city', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'wrote', 'one', 'article', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'how', 'ineffective', 'recycling', 'conclusion', 'correct', 'three', 'think-tanks', 'are', 'wrong', 'Huh', 'How', 'exactly', 'do', 'weigh', 'arguments', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'method', 'determine', 'data', 'good', 'bad', 'non-sequitor', 'say', 'least.Second', 'attack', 'individuals', 'not', 'institutions', 'who', 'spread', 'myths', 'Fountain', 'Youth', 'example', 'poke', 'fun', 'how', 'youth-obsessed', 'culture', 'Great', 'topic', 'lot', 'feminists', 'cultural', 'researchers', 'are', 'written', 'Beauty', 'Myth', 'Beauty', 'Jar', 'etc', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'start', 'out', 'fine', 'then', 'miss', 'point', 'entirely', 'end', 'up', 'poking', 'fun', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'use', 'botox.Is', ""n't"", 'more', 'effective', 'more', 'accurate', 'examine', 'industries', 'who', 'sell', 'youthfulness', 'Are', ""n't"", 'there', 'race', 'class', 'gender', 'issues', 'here', ""'re"", 'missing', 'entirely', 'i.e.', 'Let', 'say', 'son', 'history', 'textbook', 'myths', 'inaccuracies', 'Why', 'would', 'waste', 'time', 'ranting', 'how', 'ignorant', 'reading', 'Why', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'publisher', 'i.e.', 'one', 'who', 'myth', 'instead', 'Third', 'compare', 'apples', 'bananas', 'yoga', 'episode', 'interview', 'three', 'yoga', 'experts', 'who', 'rattle', 'off', 'dozen', 'advantages', 'doing', 'yoga', 'Then', 'quote', 'one', 'fitness', 'trainer', 'credentials', 'who', 'stretching', 'more', '30', 'seconds', 'redundant', 'therefore', 'yoga', 'BS', 'Huh', 'What', 'other', '11', 'advantages', 'doing', 'yoga', 'lowering', 'blood', 'pressure', 'reducing', 'stress', 'reducing', 'arthritis', 'etc', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'pick', 'just', 'one', 'small', 'facet', 'debunk', 'then', 'ignore', 'other', 'evidence', 'Trouble', 'get', 'away', ""'re"", 'so', 'entertaining.Last', 'defeatest', 'Let', 'stay', 'buy', 'notion', 'recycling', ""n't"", 'work', 'Then', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'provide', 'ANY', 'viable', 'alternatives', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'toxins', 'seeping', 'earth', 'water', 'supply', 'How', 'consuming', 'less', 'using', 'environmentally', 'friendly', 'alternatives', 'so', 'what', 'are', 'alternatives', 'laughed', 'show', 'watching', 'few', 'episodes', 'walked', 'away', 'feeling', 'depressed', 'hopeless.I', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'entertaining', 'actually', 'get', 'hear', 'Teller', 'voice', 'once', 'twice']",N/A

One person featured is a right wing radio talk show host who says it's permissible to eat chicken because, in his words, ""...chickens are stupid.  Very stupid.""  He also says the reason why groups like PETA exist is because people today do not know what evil is .  According to the radio talk show host people think no atrocities are committed against people so they only think atrocities are committed against animals.  This is utter nonsense.  It's nothing but opinion and I think Penn & Teller should focus more on fact than the personal opinions of people they agree with on certain subjects.The episode on finding true love is deflintely the worst of the season.  It's 100% opinion and nothing else.  Penn says it's impossible to find love that lasts a lifetime.  Apparently he disagrees with his own show because he recently got married.There are some good things to say about the second season of ""Bulls---.""  The episode ""Death, Inc."" is probaly the best of the series because it relies more on fact than other epsiodes and is not just riddled with opinion.  This episode is what the rest of the season should be like.As I said before the second season of ""Bulls---"" is inferior to the first but it does have it's high points and should not be missed.",3,Not as Good as Season One but Still Worth It,1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,1686,"['second', 'season', 'Bulls', 'very', 'good', 'season', 'do', 'recommend', 'have', 'flaws', 'make', 'inferior', 'first', 'season.One', 'biggest', 'flaws', 'episode', 'PETA', 'episode', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'extreme', 'PETA', 'can', 'be', 'condoning', 'violence', 'supporting', 'men', 'Robert', 'Coranado', 'who', 'convicted', 'arsonist', 'taken', 'money', 'PETA', 'episode', 'own', 'share', 'bulls', 'One', 'person', 'featured', 'right', 'wing', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'who', 'permissible', 'eat', 'chicken', 'words', 'chickens', 'are', 'stupid', 'Very', 'stupid', 'also', 'reason', 'why', 'groups', 'PETA', 'exist', 'people', 'today', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'According', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'people', 'think', 'atrocities', 'are', 'committed', 'people', 'only', 'think', 'atrocities', 'are', 'committed', 'animals', 'utter', 'nonsense', 'nothing', 'opinion', 'think', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'should', 'focus', 'more', 'fact', 'personal', 'opinions', 'people', 'agree', 'certain', 'subjects.The', 'episode', 'finding', 'true', 'love', 'deflintely', 'worst', 'season', '100', '%', 'opinion', 'nothing', 'else', 'Penn', 'impossible', 'find', 'love', 'lifetime', 'Apparently', 'own', 'show', 'recently', 'got', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'second', 'season', 'Bulls', 'episode', 'Death', 'Inc.', 'best', 'series', 'more', 'fact', 'other', 'epsiodes', 'not', 'just', 'riddled', 'opinion', 'episode', 'what', 'rest', 'season', 'should', 'be', 'like.As', 'said', 'second', 'season', 'Bulls', 'inferior', 'first', 'have', 'high', 'points', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A
865707,ADTUS88NFTW23,B0006FO5IC,"Melkor ""dark lord""","[19, 26]","In my review of Season One of Penn & Teller's B.S., I gave an in depth explanation of my opinion of the show.  I don't want to retread that in this review, but to give you an idea of where I'm coming from, here's a short explanation.  I appreciate what Penn and Teller are trying to do with this show and enjoy watching it.  My problem is that they often use skepticism as a dogma rather than a method, and rarely explore the weakness of their own arguments.  This leads to some heavy disagreements I have with them on a logical level, but I'm sure that they would want their viewers to be as skeptical as they are.I think Season Two is a bit more of a mix bag than Season One.  One of the most interesting episodes of the Season was the ""Death"" episode.  I had heard before about the racket that the ""Managed Death Corporations"" were running to exploit grieving families, so I was happy to see this issue brought to light.  The episode on ""Yoga, Tarot, and Tantric"" was a return to exposing the false claims New Age con artists.  Same with the ""Hypnosis"".  It was amazing to see the one person claiming to be able to fight Cancer with hypnosis!  This person advertises frequently on the radio, and I have to turn it off every time I hear her add.  The ""Love"", ""12-Step"", and ""Youth"" episodes were focused along the same line of exposing those who exploit the depressed, lonely, etc.The Bible episode was interesting; though, I think the episode was a little weaker than it could have been.  Why didn't they go into the history of the Bible?  The time that each book was written, followed by the rewrites, edits, translations, and changes made through history is a very fascinating story that is only touched upon in the show.  The point to remember is that many people have forgotten how to read that book as a religious text.  As Joseph Campbell said, ""Read it as literal as a newspaper, then it is meaningless.  Read it as stories, myths, and poems; then it can be enlightening.""They delved more into political topics this season, which is where I think they are their weakest.  The ""War On Drugs"" episode focused on marijuana.  This was an interesting episode, but could have been made stronger by a little more history on marijuana prohibition.  The profanity episode shows scary people who wish to control what we say and what they hear.  They did a great job doing a mini-review of profanity and free speech struggles, as well as pointing out that people are getting all worked up over nothing more than a particular grouping of phonemes.The recycling episode was eye opening, but I think needs a lot more research on the part of the viewer.  First off, there's Daniel K. Benjamin, their professor who argues against recycling.  I did a little research and it turns out that he was a Reagan economic advisor, and much of his research was funded by the ExxonMobil corporation.  This may not mean that he's wrong, but he might be biased.  Then, as in season one, they make the ridiculous argument that without the paper industry, there would be no trees.  What?  If we stopped using paper we would just chop down all those unsightly, space taking plants?  Yeah, right. (is my sarcasm coming across?).  Definitely take this episode with a grain of salt.The Safety Episode was o.k., but I think they were a little easy on all the people who were cashing in on the nation's fear over 9-11.  They quote the Cato institute in this episode, and quite frequently throughout their series.  The more I look into them, the less I like them.  Though they claim to be a ""libertarian"" organization, they are not.  Don't trust me, though.  Look into them for yourselves, and make up your own minds.  Also, towards the end of the episode they take a swipe at Michael Moore, and then argue for the whole point of his ""Columbine"" movie.  It's odd that people who agree with Michael still have to hate him, just because it's the thing to do.Finally, there's the PETA episode.  This is the first episode on the discs, and in my opinion the worst one.  I am a scientist/statistician, and I can't stand PETA; which is why I'm going to be so hard on P&T; for making swishy arguments.  First off, they mix two independent organizations (the ADL and PETA).  The often show examples of one organization doing bad things, and then apply their conclusions towards the other.  This is a really weak practice.  Next, on their panel of experts the get a radio host.  To me, his credentials are about as valid as someone demanding respect because they are a blogger.  He said something along the lines of, ""That statement was so dumb that only a college educated person would say that.""  So...all those scientists and academics in the episode should pack their bags and go home?  Finally, we get The Nudge.  Fighting left wing fundamentalist wack-o's with a right wing fundamentalist wack-o just shows that we can be as bad as they are.  After reading some of his book, and hearing some of his quotes, Nugent is not someone I want speaking for my side.In conclusion, for all my nit-picks, I still enjoy and recommend this show.  I really appreciate what they are doing; but it is important to remember that even though P&T; are funny and charismatic, we still need to be skeptical of our skeptics.  Occasionally they use biased sources or make weak arguments.  Occasionally they use exaggeration when the true facts would have been helped them just as much untouched (like the PETA example).  Also (like Fox news) they often mistake an angry, loud, declarative statement for a factual and informed opinion.  These are pretty easy to recognize when they happen.  So, get this and enjoy watching them take issues apart, but then research them for yourself before you make you final decision.",4,B.S.

However, there are some issues that are less cut and dry, and P&T; have taken it upon themselves to decide just where we ought to stand on such issues as religious faith, moral values, and love. They are unabashedly atheistic hedonists, and that's their right. Yet, they seem to have replaced faith in God with faith in psychology.In fact, where the issues become murky, they chronically turn to psychologists & sociologists as if somehow the soft science of psychology has become scientifically provable. They have psychobabblers who would have us believe that Christianity and Judaism are cults, that children being raised in intact families with a husband and wife are a fiction perpetuated by 1950's television, and that swingers and homosexuals raising children is the societal norm. I suppose if one lives in a decadent metropolis, they might believe this to be true.

865713,A2SJVW2REZJ0Y,B0006FO5IC,Silence Dogood,"[7, 20]","While Penn and Teller generally do a good job exposing various forms of hokum on their show, their half-hour format only suffices when delving into easy targets, like anti-aging miracle treatments or safety hysteria.  It's not nearly enough time to effectively debunk more complex subjects.  Such is the case this season when they attempt to lay waste to the Bible, a book that's been around in its present form for about 450 years, and includes writings that have stood the test of time for eons.  In this episode P&T; promise to ""reveal the many discrepancies and contradictions in the Bible"" and call into question not only whether Moses parted the Red Sea, but whether Jesus even existed.  As a deist, I'm always on the lookout for evidence confirming or disproving events in the Bible, but frankly I was disappointed by what's uncovered.  P&T; demonstrate at most a dim awareness of the Bible, and the duo resort to a jumbled, let's-throw-everything-we-can-at-the-subject-and-hope-some-of-it-sticks approach.  What the viewer gets are hyperbolic accusations with little more than theories to back up the claims.P&T; and their one expert--Skeptic Magazine's publisher Michael Shermer--assert the Bible is ""mythic story-telling and nothing more,"" that archeology has revealed ""most everything in the Bible is fiction."" Yet their archeological evidence proving the fictitious nature of the Bible is actually the LACK OF archeological evidence that's surfaced supporting certain events that allegedly took place.  In fact, P&T; somehow manage to go thirty minutes without producing a shred of archeological evidence proving any part of the Bible is fiction.For example, their evidence that the Hebrews' exodus from Egypt never took place is the lack of a corroborating account by the Egyptians.  While this may call into question the Hebrews' version of events, it does not disprove them.  Further, as Paul Maier--the episode's lone expert defending the Bible--points out (and Shermer grudgingly concedes), Egyptians recorded their victories, not their defeats.The episode spends a fair amount of time on Genesis.  Here P&T; demonstrate that Chapters 1 and 2 give two different versions of the Adam and Eve-creation story (though they fail to mention that the versions are not contradictory) and make light of the notion that Noah built an ark and gathered up two of every creature in anticipation of the great flood.  Their evidence that the latter never took place consists of interviewing people on the street to ask whether they believe the Noah story, and pointing out that the story bears a resemblance to a well-known tale involving a Sumerian king and the Euphrates River. Perhaps the Sumerian king's adventure inspired the Noah tale, perhaps not.  But speculation is not archeological evidence proving the Noah tale never happened, nor does it demonstrate any kind of inconsistency or inaccuracy. While they do provide an example of an impossibility--Noah couldn't have collected two of every species and later redistributed them to their proper habitats--showing one impossibility does not prove the Bible is full of them, as Penn and Teller contend.Their case grows far shakier when they jump from the Old Testament to the New.  Unfortunately for P&T;, plenty of archeological evidence exists confirming events and figures depicted in the New Testament, so here they resort to a different approach. They start out by making a ludicrous comparison between Elvis Presley and Jesus Christ.  Both figures, they point out, achieved fame, had plenty of followers, died and were seen alive years later.  Apparently they're attempting to diminish the Jesus accounts by finding a like example in our own time.  But their argument falls apart when one examines what they leave out.  The people who supposedly sighted Elvis in the nineteen eighties were not acquaintances of his, whereas Jesus made multiple appearances to people who knew him and who wouldn't have confused him with a look-alike. And the people who claim Elvis is still around believe he never died, whereas Jesus' followers believe he came back from the dead.  Further, no miracles are attributed to Elvis, and to date none of the Memphis Mafia has given up his life proclaiming Elvis was the Messiah.Next P&T; bring forth Shermer again, who remarks that ""within the community of people who study this stuff, there are some who are [skeptical Jesus existed].""  But he doesn't then provide the names of the skeptics, or their credentials, or even hint as to why they question Jesus' existence.  Instead he (grudgingly once more) acknowledges that he himself believes Jesus probably existed.  P&T; then admit that a couple sources outside the Bible make mention of Jesus, leading the viewer to wonder why the issue was even raised.Following this letdown, Shermer points out that during Jesus' time there were lots of would-be Messiahs.  This is true, of course, as Jesus lived during an age when the Romans occupied the Jewish homeland, and the Messiah was expected to rise up and toss them out.  But so what?  Only one Messiah kicked off a religion that continues to prosper two thousand years later.  If anything this point seems to weigh in favor of Jesus being the true Messiah.Then Shermer commits the biggest blunder in the episode.  In an attempt to demonstrate Jesus really wasn't all that remarkable a character, Shermer carts out Apollonius of Tyana, a Greek Pythagorean philosopher and teacher who was also around in the first century.  His followers, we are told, believe he healed the sick, raised the dead, walked through walls, was persecuted for his religious beliefs, was put on trial by the Romans, was crucified, ascended into Heaven, and came back and met his followers.  In light of the apparent similarities between Apollonius and Jesus, one is forced to conclude somebody ripped off somebody else's story.  The only question is, who ripped off whom, and the answer couldn't be more obvious.  First of all, Apollonius wasn't born until about 40 AD, approximately seven years AFTER Jesus died. The Apostle Paul's first writings--in which he stated in no uncertain terms Jesus rose from the dead--began surfacing about ten years after the death of Jesus, when Apollonius was still a toddler.  The Acts of the Apostles and the Gospels began appearing somewhere between 40 AD and 100 AD (scholars tend to date their emergence at around 65 AD).  So, in order for the Gospel writers to have stolen Apollonius' story rather than the other way around, they would have begun writing their accounts when Apollonius was around 25.  (Never mind that the stories in the Gospels were probably circulating for decades by word of mouth before being put to paper.) Apollonius lived to 120 AD, so the authors of the Gospels documented Jesus' resurrection at least 20--and probably 55--years before Apollonius supposedly duplicated the feat.Things look even worse for Apollonius when one considers that virtually everything known about him regarding his supposed supernatural abilities comes from a biography that was finished around 230 AD, 110 years AFTER Apollonius' death and 130 years after the latest estimate of the Gospels' emergence onto the scene.  The author was one Philostratus, a Greek sophist who wrote the biography at the behest of the Roman empress Julia Domna.  Philostratus claimed he drew his information from multiple sources, but if they ever existed they've been lost to time, and modern scholars dismiss much of the work as pure fiction. Using it to disprove Jesus' divinity is like citing passages from Erich Von Daniken's ""Chariot of the Gods"" to deny the Jewish Holocaust took place.Shermer doesn't stop there, however.  Next he makes the absurd claim that ""most of the miracles"" attributed to Jesus could be performed by P&T; on their stage show.  Sure, P&T; are skilled illusionists capable of performing versions of Jesus' miracles, but if forced to adhere to the specifics of the miracles as laid out in the Gospels (e.g. turning a jug of water into drinkable wine rather than red-colored water) while limited to using whatever means a first-century peasant had available, they'd have a pretty tough time of it.  I, for one, would be the first in line to catch a show featuring such illusions as curing a man known to be blind since birth, healing lepers, walking across a non-frozen lake, feeding 5,000 people with two fish and five loaves of bread, reattaching an ear that's been cut from a man's head, bringing back to life a man who's been dead for four days, and calming a storm upon command.Having failed to disprove Jesus' existence or explain away his miracles, Shermer then turns to the reliability of the New Testament writings, pointing out that some early writings were not included in the official canon.  I'm not sure what his point is, but he raises the question, Why were these other ""sacred"" books left out of the Bible, and why were committees formed to determine what got included in the official canon?  Apparently it never occurred to Shermer that both Christians and non-Christians might have produced fraudulent writings to further their own particular agendas. Perhaps Shermer thinks God should have automatically prevented bogus gospels to be produced, but doing so would have been contrary to the basic concept of free will.  Therefore it became necessary for early Christians to form committees to squelch the gospel writings that were not authentic.  As Maier points out, the committees integrated those works that had already become tradition in the Christian church.  Furthermore, they weeded out those works that presented a different version of Jesus than existed in the legitimate books of the New Testament.Finally, P&T; switch gears once more and focus on the Ten Commandments.  Here P&T; and Shermer aptly demonstrate that the Bible in general and the Old Testament in particular contain a dizzying array of laws to obey, including such rarely followed edicts as stoning disobedient children.  Clearly, as the illusionists contend, contemporary Christians and Jews pick and choose which laws they're going to obey, and admittedly P&T; score some points on this subject.  But for what it's worth, one of the things Jesus was clear about in the Gospels is that he sought to do away with the myriad laws that came before him. He essentially boiled down the earlier laws to ""Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind"" and ""Love your neighbor as yourself.""  The implication seems to be that too many questionable laws had been set forth by earlier Jewish leaders, and God was trying to make things clearer.  One of the last comments Shermer makes is that the Bible is human-edited, and on that he couldn't be more right.  The Bible is a complex work, and partly it serves as a document of man's attempt to understand God, God's will, and the nature of man's relationship to God. It is neither a clear-cut history book nor a code of ethics to follow, nor does it seem to be free of errors.  But for all we know, these ""errors"" exist to challenge us to think critically and are part of God's plan.",2,"DEBUNKING THE BIBLE--CUTE THEATRICS, LOUSY ARGUMENTS",1201132800,"01 24,

I saw some of the episodes from the first season one of which, on ""Second Hand Smoke,"" I found offensive. I actually agreed with their point, that such smoke is nowhere near the threat that some activists claim it is. But they used as their reference a right-wing radio host and someone from the CATO Institute or some other right wing think tank. I wondered: Have they ever read Aristotle's ""Rhetoric""? I mean, there are bright people without the ideological baggage that will convince me far more than some moron with a radio show, and someone else paid to think that any regulation is a vast Communist plot.The fact is, I agree with much of what they say. Their presentation on the ""drug war"" for instance is on target. I agree with almost all of what they say about PETA (but their relying on Ted Nugent for an opinion challenges THIER credibility. One knows exactly what Nugent is going to say, whether it makes any sense, or took a microgram of gray matter notwithstanding.)And their show on 12-step programs is a gem. The piece on anti-aging treatments, and the woman whose role model is the Barbie doll (!) is amusing.But their sources serve not only to NOT convince me of anything, but to challenge their conclusions. The one I refer to particularly is the one on recycling. Mind you, I don't disagree with everything they say. Their first ""reason"" for recyling, they contend, is that it makes one feel good. I don't deny that many on the ""left"" could claim that as the chief objective of much of what they do. (And I'm a leftie!) But Penn and Teller use their ""staff"" to tease some Californians into having a dozen colored recycling containers in front of their house. They thereby conclude that these are just a bunch of recycling fanatics. They prove nothing of the kind. The only thing they demonstrate is that some people who're trying to do their best may be a little naive.And their sources to refute the value of recycling are (1) some professor who long ago wrote a paper on how recycling is more trouble than it's worth and (2) someone from the Competitive Enterprise Institute.Of the professor I know little, but I may someday research him to satisfy my own curiosity. But the CEI? A five minute web search will show their objectives. Suffice it to say they're EXTREMELY ideological. And the CEI spokeswoman shows a 35 mile square landfill which she argues could hold ALL of America's waste for umpteen years. Well....that's what she says.In the nuclear debate, an acronym was used: NIMBY. Not in My BackYard. Let the next landfill be opened right next to the CEI office, or they don't have the right to that opinion. And remove CEI's corporate sponsors--the same ones whose CEOs are making millions off of you and me yet argue against any regulations (lest they make a little less!)--and CEI's bureaucrats will be on the corner with a cup.Penn and Teller and their cohorts ramble on about how expensive recycling is.
