738185,A1C6YIPDQ96RHV,B00008DDGB,James D. Madden,"[16, 16]","This DVD production of the David and Goliath story has accomplished exactly what I had hoped for my 3yr old son: an interest in learning about the Lord and His involvement in the lives of those who trust Him.  My son often recites (in surprising detail) various scenes from the tale.  One of my fellow brothers in Christ calls my son ""The Little Preacher"" because my son enjoys capturing the attention of those around him so he can retell the story of David and Goliath.  I understand some reviewing this telling of the story may prefer stricter adherence to various nuances and literary exactness from Scripture - I can appreciate that as I am a literal believer of Scripture.  There is never a perfect retelling of any Biblical story that will appeal to everyone's preference.  As already mentioned, this achieved what I had hoped for my son: help him develop an interest in learning about the Lord and building a faith in the Lord.",5,Inspiring Interest in a Future Believer,1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,934,"['DVD', 'production', 'David', 'Goliath', 'story', 'accomplished', 'exactly', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', '3yr', 'old', 'son', 'interest', 'learning', 'Lord', 'involvement', 'lives', 'who', 'trust', 'Him', 'My', 'son', 'often', 'surprising', 'detail', 'various', 'scenes', 'tale', 'One', 'fellow', 'brothers', 'Christ', 'calls', 'son', 'Little', 'Preacher', 'son', 'capturing', 'attention', 'so', 'can', 'retell', 'story', 'David', 'Goliath', 'understand', 'reviewing', 'telling', 'story', 'may', 'prefer', 'stricter', 'adherence', 'various', 'nuances', 'literary', 'exactness', 'Scripture', 'can', 'appreciate', 'am', 'literal', 'believer', 'Scripture', 'never', 'perfect', 'retelling', 'Biblical', 'story', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'preference', 'already', 'mentioned', 'achieved', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'son', 'help', 'develop', 'interest', 'learning', 'Lord', 'building', 'faith', 'Lord']",N/A

The animation quality is like that typically seen in basic Saturday morning cartoons, which is good enough for kids. What I like is that all the videos in this series give all the important details of the story, rather than giving a shallow, watered-down version as is usually the case in children's stories. These will entertain preschoolers up through junior high and the script is very closely based on the scriptural account. The only reason I didn't give this series a 5 is that each video has a hokey song that could definitely have been left out, but for such a low price and good script, I can overlook that.",4,Great value,1121990400,"07 22, 2005",2005,671,"['ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'price', 'so', 'low', 'animation', 'quality', 'typically', 'seen', 'basic', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'good', 'enough', 'kids', 'What', 'like', 'videos', 'series', 'give', 'important', 'details', 'story', 'rather', 'giving', 'shallow', 'watered-down', 'version', 'usually', 'case', 'children', 'stories', 'will', 'entertain', 'preschoolers', 'up', 'junior', 'high', 'script', 'very', 'closely', 'based', 'scriptural', 'account', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'series', '5', 'video', 'hokey', 'song', 'could', 'definitely', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'such', 'low', 'price', 'good', 'script', 'can', 'overlook']",N/A
