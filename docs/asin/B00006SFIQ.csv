This DVD is filled with mini stories of Kitty and Mimi (her twin sister) White experiences and in between episodes is little games such as what animal is it as they reveal a corner with an additional hint, mixing colors, and what is the object.This is a very cute movie with great stories and life lessons sprinkled throughout and would highly recommend to anyone into the Sanrio universe.",5,Say hello to Hello Kitty,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,541,"['started', 'getting', 'daughter', 'Hello', 'Kitty', 'Youtube', 'see', 'would', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'cable/', 'Dish/', 'Netflix', 'watch', 'things', 'moment', 'DVD', 'filled', 'mini', 'stories', 'Kitty', 'Mimi', 'twin', 'sister', 'White', 'experiences', 'episodes', 'little', 'games', 'such', 'what', 'animal', 'reveal', 'corner', 'additional', 'hint', 'mixing', 'colors', 'what', 'object.This', 'very', 'cute', 'movie', 'great', 'stories', 'life', 'lessons', 'sprinkled', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'Sanrio', 'universe']",Hello Kitty's Paradise - Pretty Kitty V+I310olume 1)

After fast-forwarding through this, however, the video is entertaining and tries to teach good manners and respect for the family. In short: expect fast-talking/helium-pitched Hello Kitty entertainment in a semi-anime style for children that spouts a few good messages. My 3 year old loved it.",4,good for 3 year olds but...,1041033600,"12 28, 2002",2002,419,"['beware', '7', 'minutes', 'anime', 'previews', 'are', 'very', 'innapropriate', 'violent', 'younger', 'set', 'were', 'thinking', 'fast-forwarding', 'however', 'video', 'entertaining', 'tries', 'teach', 'good', 'manners', 'respect', 'family', 'short', 'expect', 'fast-talking/helium-pitched', 'Hello', 'Kitty', 'entertainment', 'semi-anime', 'style', 'children', 'few', 'good', 'messages', '3', 'year', 'old', 'loved']",Hello Kitty's Paradise - Pretty Kitty V+I310olume 1)
722906,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B00006SFIQ,Lesley Aeschliman,"[1, 1]","This is the first volume of DVDs released for Hello Kitty's Paradise.  The back of the box claims that there are eight complete episodes included.  However, it doesn't explicitly state that the episodes are roughly ten to eleven minutes in length; two ""episodes"" actually make up one whole episode of Hello Kitty's Paradise.  In between the stories, and sometimes at the beginning of the show, there is a ""Fun and Games"" section using claymation, and the games include such things as ""Guess the Shape"" and ""Nutty Numbers.""  Personally, I didn't care much for the claymation interstitials (in my opinion, they weren't very well-produced, and sometimes, it felt like these interstitials were talking down to children).The episodes included on this disc are: ""A Blooming Good Morning,"" ""A Storybook Adventure,"" ""Kitty's Clean Cuisine,"" ""A Day Out With Dad,"" ""Underground Kitty,"" ""Watch the Birdie,"" ""Minding Manners,"" and ""Streetwise.""  Each episode works at teaching kids important lessons about life.  Topics included on this disc are sharing, counting, safety, manners, and taking responsibility.  As a parent, I appreciated that the English dub versions of the stories included on the DVD provided positive messages for their intended audience.  I also appreciate that the English dubs of the actual stories were written in a way that the episodes didn't talk down to the audience.My 4-year-old daughter really enjoyed watching this DVD.  She's an active child, and is known for wiggling around while watching television.  However, when this DVD was playing, she sat still the entire time it was playing.  I believe it was a combination of the cute animation, the bright colors, and the stories that captivated my daughter's attention.Admittedly, this is a ""low frills"" DVD release.  The main menu has options for Scene Selection and DVD Credits.  The screenshot on the back of the box shows there are three menu options (an ADV Previews link is shown), but on the actual disc, the ADV Previews link is not included on the menu.  The DVD Credits is a screen which shows who worked on this Hello Kitty DVD release.The Hello Kitty's Paradise DVD releases contain anime that's very friendly to young children.  However, girls will probably be more interested in these DVDs than boys, due to the ""cuteness"" of Hello Kitty.  If you have a young child at home and are looking for kid-friendly anime, then I would recommend the Hello Kitty's Paradise DVDs.",3,A kid-friendly anime release,1250553600,"08 18, 2009",2009,2450,"['first', 'volume', 'DVDs', 'released', 'Hello', 'Kitty', 'Paradise', 'back', 'box', 'are', 'eight', 'complete', 'episodes', 'included', 'However', ""n't"", 'explicitly', 'state', 'episodes', 'are', 'roughly', 'ten', 'eleven', 'minutes', 'length', 'two', 'episodes', 'actually', 'make', 'up', 'one', 'whole', 'episode', 'Hello', 'Kitty', 'Paradise', 'stories', 'sometimes', 'beginning', 'show', 'Fun', 'Games', 'section', 'using', 'claymation', 'games', 'include', 'such', 'things', 'Guess', 'Shape', 'Nutty', 'Numbers', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'claymation', 'interstitials', 'opinion', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'well-produced', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'interstitials', 'were', 'talking', 'children', '.The', 'episodes', 'included', 'disc', 'are', 'Blooming', 'Good', 'Morning', 'A', 'Storybook', 'Adventure', 'Kitty', 'Clean', 'Cuisine', 'Day', 'Dad', 'Underground', 'Kitty', 'Watch', 'Birdie', 'Minding', 'Manners', 'Streetwise', 'episode', 'teaching', 'kids', 'important', 'lessons', 'life', 'Topics', 'included', 'disc', 'are', 'sharing', 'counting', 'safety', 'manners', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'parent', 'appreciated', 'English', 'dub', 'versions', 'stories', 'included', 'DVD', 'provided', 'positive', 'messages', 'intended', 'audience', 'also', 'appreciate', 'English', 'dubs', 'actual', 'stories', 'were', 'written', 'way', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'talk', 'audience.My', '4-year-old', 'daughter', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'DVD', 'active', 'child', 'known', 'wiggling', 'around', 'watching', 'television', 'However', 'when', 'DVD', 'was', 'playing', 'sat', 'still', 'entire', 'time', 'was', 'playing', 'believe', 'was', 'combination', 'cute', 'animation', 'bright', 'colors', 'stories', 'captivated', 'daughter', 'attention.Admittedly', 'low', 'frills', 'DVD', 'release', 'main', 'menu', 'options', 'Scene', 'Selection', 'DVD', 'Credits', 'screenshot', 'back', 'box', 'are', 'three', 'menu', 'options', 'ADV', 'Previews', 'link', 'shown', 'actual', 'disc', 'ADV', 'Previews', 'link', 'not', 'included', 'menu', 'DVD', 'Credits', 'screen', 'who', 'worked', 'Hello', 'Kitty', 'DVD', 'release.The', 'Hello', 'Kitty', 'Paradise', 'DVD', 'contain', 'very', 'friendly', 'young', 'children', 'However', 'girls', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'DVDs', 'boys', 'due', 'cuteness', 'Hello', 'Kitty', 'have', 'young', 'child', 'home', 'are', 'looking', 'kid-friendly', 'anime', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'Hello', 'Kitty', 'Paradise', 'DVDs']",Hello Kitty's Paradise - Pretty Kitty V+I310olume 1)
