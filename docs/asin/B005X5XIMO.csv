1505025,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B005X5XIMO,FYI,"[6, 6]","The picture-quality of this satisfying series is just fine, much better than expected; set your television to ""vivid"" if needed, to intensify colors. There's an old Cornish saying, ""the Devil is afraid to come to Cornwall for fear of being baked into a pasty."" The story is even more engaging than I recalled, from viewing it in the late 1970s. The cast is superb, all the actors are wonderfully involved and convincing. This classic stands the test of time. The swashbuckling Captain Ross Poldark is perfectly played by Robin Ellis; Series 1 contains an informative excerpt from the first chapter of his bookMaking Poldark. Poldark's Demelza, that delightful, elfin redhead, is brought to life by the fine (why isn't she more famous?) Welsh actress Angharad Rees. Jill Townsend is cold perfection as Demelza's rival, Cousin Elizabeth.Midsomer Murdersfans will delight in a very young Jane Wymark as the lovely Morwenna. Poldark's nemesis, George Warleggan, is perfectly embodied by Ralph Bates. Trudie Styler (Sting's wife) plays a village slattern, Emma Tregirls, who torments Demelza's devout brother Sam with her tawdry wares. Poldark's servants Jud Paynter (remarkable Scottish actor Paul Curran) and his wife Prudie (Mary Wimbush) are constant scene-stealers; the episode written by Peter Draper, featuring Jud's resurrection from the dead during a drunken wake, is a hilarious must-see. The narrative is so well-rendered by the wonderful cast that it overcomes Series 2's unfortunate `70s era background music. Morwenna meets Demelza's bother Drake again, with his lovely declaration. Oddly, instead of Ross and Demelza, the saga concludes with George Warleggan's torment; an abrupt ending indeed. After viewing such rarified, excellent fare asDownton Abbey, the rough authenticity of this Cornish show has its own allure. Considering when it was created, it's remarkable what a sizable portion of the narrative was filmed outside, along the rugged Cornish coastline. The hard lives of lower classes is explored quite effectively, against a rich historical background referring to the American and French Revolutions, and the difficult lives of Cornish miners displaced during difficult economic times. Having family from Redruth, Cornwall, and knowing of Cornish migrations to the American West, I appreciate this vivid depiction of Cornish life, from the gentry, to the villagers. To quote Prudie, ""I could 'ave ee for breakfast 'n still be hungry.""

1505026,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B005X5XIMO,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[58, 59]","Poldark is the 1790s. It's British Cornwall delightful; exquisite sets, locations, costuming & dialogue. Robin Ellis is Ross Poldark, and winning awards in the process. Writer, Winston Graham, gives us a sensual look at 18th century life in rural, SW England. It's no wonder the show has been considered one of the all-time great Masterpiece Theatre works. It is timeless, one you will watch repeatedly. Angharad Rees is Demelza Poldark, Jill Townsend is Elizabeth Warleggan, & Ralph Bates plays Geo. Warleggan, the villain of the series. You'll laugh at Jud (Paul Curran.)Two families become rivals in Series one and continue the same through episodes (called parts on the DVD) filled with suspense, ambition, swashbuckling action, romance, humor, heroics, historical drama, betrayal, and just about any other element of passion and emotion possible by bickering families. A saga you will enjoy, and don't overlook Series One, now discounted to a very affordable value.Series 1 & 2 is 32 parts, each almost an hour, all WITH SUBTITLES, and remarkably fine given the fact it was originally aired in 1977. BBC excellence. The second half also provides a different look at Jane Wymark (playing Morwenna) who is known for her role as Joyce Barnaby in ""Midsomer Murders."" She is good. Morwenna meets Drake (Kevin McNally-""Pirates of the Caribbean"") & Judy Geeson is Caroline. Accolades could go on forever for cast and the story.

1505029,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B005X5XIMO,John D. Cofield,"[2, 2]","Back in the late 1970s I remember a couple of summers when Sunday night's Masterpiece Theater had me utterly transfixed.  Poldark was a swashbuckling tale of late 18th century Cornwall. Captain Ross Poldark has returned from service in the British Army after the American Revolution to find his father dead, his estate gone to rack and ruin, and his beloved Elizabeth engaged to his cousin Francis.  Season 1 focusses on Ross's continuing love for Elizabeth, his struggle to make his tin and copper mines profitable, and his growing love for Demelza, a young girl he takes in as a servant, marries out of duty after making her pregnant, then finds her to be an ideal life partner. Most of all, there is the rivalry between Poldark and the ambitious George Warleggan, a story which symbolizes the changes in England as a rising newly wealthy class, founded on industry and sharp business practices, challenges the power of the older gentry families.  Season 2 continues to chronicle Ross and Demelza's doings but also introduces several new characters, most importantly Morwenna, Elizabeth's beautiful cousin who loves Demelza's brother Drake but is forced into marriage with an odious clergyman instead.This is a barebones description of the lengthy but always fascinating main plot with its multitudinous twists and turns.  There are many sideplots as well, including the love of Francis's sister Verity for a sea captain with a dark past, the simple miner Mark Daniel who tragically falls in love with a beautiful actress, the young Dr. Enys who plays a role in Mark Daniel's tragedy then falls in love with the witty Caroline Penvenen, and the hilarious servants Jud and Prudie Paynter.  Watching Poldark again after so many years is fun, though some of the soap operaish touches and melodramatic musical flourishes seem a bit over done. I'm very glad to have the complete and unedited series on DVD.  Previously I had owned box VHS sets of both seasons, but they were clumsily edited with a lot of the subplots truncated or even done away with completely.  Now I can watch Ross's ups and downs, along with those of his friends, family, servants, and enemies, whenever I choose, and I will choose to do so often!",5,"A Beloved Saga, Now Complete",1369353600,"05 24, 2013",2013,2215,"['Back', 'late', '1970s', 'remember', 'couple', 'summers', 'when', 'Sunday', 'night', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'had', 'utterly', 'transfixed', 'Poldark', 'was', 'swashbuckling', 'tale', 'late', '18th', 'century', 'Cornwall', 'Captain', 'Ross', 'Poldark', 'returned', 'service', 'British', 'Army', 'American', 'Revolution', 'find', 'father', 'dead', 'estate', 'gone', 'rack', 'ruin', 'beloved', 'Elizabeth', 'engaged', 'cousin', 'Francis', 'Season', '1', 'focusses', 'Ross', 'continuing', 'love', 'Elizabeth', 'struggle', 'make', 'tin', 'copper', 'mines', 'profitable', 'growing', 'love', 'Demelza', 'young', 'girl', 'servant', 'duty', 'making', 'pregnant', 'then', 'be', 'ideal', 'life', 'partner', 'Most', 'rivalry', 'Poldark', 'ambitious', 'George', 'Warleggan', 'story', 'changes', 'England', 'rising', 'newly', 'wealthy', 'class', 'founded', 'industry', 'sharp', 'business', 'practices', 'power', 'older', 'gentry', 'families', 'Season', '2', 'chronicle', 'Ross', 'Demelza', 'doings', 'also', 'several', 'new', 'characters', 'most', 'importantly', 'Morwenna', 'Elizabeth', 'beautiful', 'cousin', 'who', 'Demelza', 'brother', 'Drake', 'forced', 'marriage', 'odious', 'clergyman', 'instead.This', 'barebones', 'description', 'lengthy', 'always', 'fascinating', 'main', 'plot', 'multitudinous', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'many', 'sideplots', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'love', 'Francis', 'sister', 'Verity', 'sea', 'captain', 'dark', 'past', 'simple', 'miner', 'Mark', 'Daniel', 'who', 'tragically', 'love', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'young', 'Dr.', 'Enys', 'who', 'role', 'Mark', 'Daniel', 'tragedy', 'then', 'love', 'witty', 'Caroline', 'Penvenen', 'hilarious', 'servants', 'Jud', 'Prudie', 'Paynter', 'Watching', 'Poldark', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'fun', 'soap', 'operaish', 'touches', 'melodramatic', 'musical', 'flourishes', 'seem', 'bit', 'done', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'have', 'complete', 'unedited', 'series', 'DVD', 'Previously', 'had', 'owned', 'box', 'VHS', 'sets', 'seasons', 'were', 'clumsily', 'edited', 'lot', 'subplots', 'truncated', 'even', 'done', 'away', 'completely', 'Now', 'can', 'watch', 'Ross', 'ups', 'downs', 'friends', 'family', 'servants', 'enemies', 'whenever', 'choose', 'will', 'choose', 'do', 'so', 'often']",POLDARK: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION

1505033,A3CNHQE38TG0M2,B005X5XIMO,Kathryn K. Hansen,"[45, 46]","I absolutely loved watching this series when they were showing it about 15 yrs after it's first airing on our PBS station. So, once it was over I went to the library and read the books. The books were written by Winston Graham (original author of the book of ""Marnie"" that Hitchcock changed and filmed). There were changes. There had to be, since there were quite a number of novels to cover. But I thought both novels and TV were very good. I learned a lot about England after the war that we Americans call 'The Revolutionary War'. I learned a lot about mining in those days too, and it was fascinating. But of course, the story of the people is the main reason that we watch and read this great series. Americans have to remember how British television differed from American at the time it was made (1975). Much of the time it feels more like a stage play videotaped with a handheld camera. Once you deal with that it is a wonderful experience. It was always hard to wait for the next week's episode. Also, in answer to the first reviewer and anyone else that is concerned about subtitles not being mentioned. If you look up the site of the company that put this series onto DVD (Acornonline.com), you will see in the ""Details"" section that they do have ""SDH"", which stands for ""Subtitled for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing"". So, there should at least be English subtitles available. This is an important issue to me as well. I am excited to get the series.",5,Happy It Is Finally On DVD,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,1459,"['absolutely', 'loved', 'watching', 'series', 'when', 'were', 'showing', '15', 'yrs', 'first', 'airing', 'PBS', 'station', 'So', 'was', 'went', 'library', 'read', 'books', 'books', 'were', 'written', 'Winston', 'Graham', 'original', 'author', 'book', 'Marnie', 'Hitchcock', 'changed', 'filmed', 'were', 'changes', 'had', 'be', 'were', 'quite', 'number', 'novels', 'cover', 'thought', 'novels', 'TV', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'learned', 'lot', 'England', 'war', 'Americans', 'call', ""'The"", 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'learned', 'lot', 'mining', 'days', 'too', 'was', 'fascinating', 'course', 'story', 'people', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'read', 'great', 'series', 'Americans', 'have', 'remember', 'how', 'British', 'television', 'differed', 'American', 'time', 'was', 'made', '1975', 'Much', 'time', 'more', 'stage', 'play', 'videotaped', 'handheld', 'camera', 'deal', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'was', 'always', 'hard', 'wait', 'next', 'week', 'episode', 'Also', 'answer', 'first', 'reviewer', 'anyone', 'else', 'concerned', 'subtitles', 'not', 'being', 'mentioned', 'look', 'up', 'site', 'company', 'put', 'series', 'DVD', 'Acornonline.com', 'will', 'see', 'Details', 'section', 'do', 'have', 'SDH', 'Subtitled', 'Deaf', 'Hard', 'Hearing', 'So', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'English', 'subtitles', 'available', 'important', 'issue', 'well', 'am', 'excited', 'get', 'series']",POLDARK: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION

1505036,A2WARQRIDTIRNJ,B005X5XIMO,Ruby D,"[0, 0]","We just received this series in the beginning of December.  We are not totally through it...we have just started series 2.  It was a little slow getting started and we were not sure if we were going to like it, but we gave it a chance and we are really enjoying it...tremendously.  There are really some characters in it that liven things up.  If you like period pieces you may want to give it a try.  I paid $28.49 for it and feel it is a deal for the amount of entertainment we are getting.  I cannot imagine what we would spend to go to the movies for this amount of hours and we don't have to worry about getting a cold or the flu!2/1/13  UPDATE...we finally finished this series.  We really enjoyed it.  Yes, there are some weak moments here and there, but very few productions of this length will be without flaws.  If you like period pieces and a soap opera style you will probably enjoy this.  By soap opera style I mean for everything great that happens....in seconds there is a tragedy.  Up and down...up and down!  Again, we, my fiance and I, really did enjoy it.  There are some colorful characters that you will get a laugh at and then on the other side there is allot of drama.
