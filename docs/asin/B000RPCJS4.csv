1083701,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B000RPCJS4,drkhimxz,"[6, 7]","No doubt Jericho of Scotland Yards, portrayed with excellence by Robert Lindsay, a troubled man and, therefore, not exactly a beloved figure at The Yard. In fact, if not for his long term, erstwhile partner and still friend, The Sarge. he would be a complete outsider to the major focus of his life, work as a police officer, He also happens to be The Star  of the Yard, noted for the number and magnitude of his solved cases. His father was a corrupt cop murdered in his home by gunmen employed by nobody knows whom: but, Jericho thinks he knows who dun it, and is miserable over the fact that he cannot put The Big Boss away. The Big Boss has an effective organization including two members of the police force in his own precinct. No wonder Jericho is so quick to offense and so little controlled in his expression of his discontent. Though no overt mention is made of the matter, he is also Jewish. As if everything else were not enough.There is a certain manipulation of plot endings to give convenient solutions without the logical evil doer being the criminal. Nonetheless, this and other inconsistencies paled for me in the face of the strength of Lindsey's performance,  the solid work of others in the cast. London is made interesting and one meets many characters within it. Not everyone will go for this limited series but I found it involving and interesting.",5,Jericho is a Troubled Man,1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,1372,"['doubt', 'Jericho', 'Scotland', 'Yards', 'portrayed', 'excellence', 'Robert', 'Lindsay', 'troubled', 'man', 'therefore', 'not', 'exactly', 'beloved', 'figure', 'Yard', 'fact', 'not', 'long', 'term', 'erstwhile', 'partner', 'still', 'friend', 'Sarge', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'outsider', 'major', 'focus', 'life', 'work', 'police', 'officer', 'also', 'be', 'Star', 'Yard', 'noted', 'number', 'magnitude', 'solved', 'cases', 'father', 'was', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'murdered', 'home', 'gunmen', 'employed', 'nobody', 'knows', 'whom', 'Jericho', 'who', 'miserable', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'Big', 'Boss', 'away', 'Big', 'Boss', 'effective', 'organization', 'including', 'two', 'members', 'police', 'force', 'own', 'precinct', 'wonder', 'Jericho', 'so', 'quick', 'offense', 'so', 'little', 'controlled', 'expression', 'discontent', 'overt', 'mention', 'made', 'matter', 'also', 'Jewish', 'everything', 'else', 'were', 'not', 'enough.There', 'certain', 'manipulation', 'plot', 'endings', 'give', 'convenient', 'solutions', 'logical', 'evil', 'doer', 'being', 'criminal', 'Nonetheless', 'other', 'inconsistencies', 'paled', 'face', 'strength', 'Lindsey', 'performance', 'solid', 'work', 'others', 'cast', 'London', 'made', 'interesting', 'one', 'meets', 'many', 'characters', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'go', 'limited', 'series', 'found', 'involving', 'interesting']",Jericho of Scotland Yard - Series 1 & 2

1083705,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B000RPCJS4,Richard B. Schwartz,"[15, 16]","The Jericho series is well worth watching, but its strengths are in its atmospherics more than in its scripts and its characters.  Jericho himself is a nicely-realized figure, but his trench coat and hat, his talisman and his everpresent cigarette are more important to his portrayal than his language or skills at ratiocination.  The real star of the show is 1950's London, with damp streets reflecting neon, nasty alleyways and deep class lines separating the (sometimes guilty) rich from the (sometimes innocent) poor.  The ultimate effect is noir taken to the nth degree and there is sometimes a comic book dimension to the series, both in its graphics and in its use of colors, the gritty yellow of Jericho's trench coat reminding me of the stark yellow of Dick Tracy's.  Many watch British drama for the country settings, the costumes and the domestic architecture.  Watch Jericho for the urban setting, but remember that the 'realism' is highly stylized, unlike that seen in the world of, e.g., Jack Frost.",4,A for atmospherics,1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,1013,"['Jericho', 'series', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'strengths', 'are', 'atmospherics', 'more', 'scripts', 'characters', 'Jericho', 'nicely-realized', 'figure', 'trench', 'coat', 'hat', 'talisman', 'everpresent', 'cigarette', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'portrayal', 'language', 'skills', 'ratiocination', 'real', 'star', 'show', '1950', 'London', 'damp', 'streets', 'reflecting', 'neon', 'nasty', 'alleyways', 'deep', 'class', 'lines', 'separating', 'sometimes', 'guilty', 'rich', 'sometimes', 'innocent', 'poor', 'ultimate', 'effect', 'noir', 'taken', 'nth', 'degree', 'sometimes', 'comic', 'book', 'dimension', 'series', 'graphics', 'use', 'colors', 'gritty', 'yellow', 'Jericho', 'trench', 'coat', 'reminding', 'stark', 'yellow', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'Many', 'watch', 'British', 'drama', 'country', 'settings', 'costumes', 'domestic', 'architecture', 'Watch', 'Jericho', 'urban', 'setting', 'remember', ""'realism"", 'highly', 'stylized', 'seen', 'world', 'e.g.', 'Jack', 'Frost']",Jericho of Scotland Yard - Series 1 & 2

1083707,A3H4EV4UMST3HV,B000RPCJS4,steve b,"[28, 29]","If you have watched Foyle's War, you may think that the producers of Jericho have just cashed in on a fashion for period detectives. That may be so but Jericho captures its period far better than Foyle's War did. Set in the Nineteen Fifties, Jericho is at least in part based on real celebrity detective, Robert Fabian, known as 'Fabien of the Yard.' Fabien like Jericho having a TV series based on his cases. Robert Lindsay who plays Jericho is a talented actor who is equally at home in light comedies as well as in serious drama. He does not disappoint. The real surprise is the casting of Peter Bowles as the villainous heavy. Bowles is best known for his roles as upper crust English gentlemen in comedies. As the bad guy he is superb, a gem of inspired casting.The real star however is the sets and the costumes. It took Britain a long time to recover from the Second World War, rationing for instance continued into the fifties. At the time Jericho is set Glamour, which in practise meant all things American, was finally being introduced even if it was overlaid on a background of neglect, grime and disrepair.
