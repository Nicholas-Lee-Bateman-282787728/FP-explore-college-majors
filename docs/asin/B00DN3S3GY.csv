1659471,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00DN3S3GY,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I will admit, I am not entirely familiar with the Beat Generation.  In fact, I hadn&#8217;t even heard the term, despite knowing the names involved, until I saw this film.  How embarrassing is that!  On the other hand, I was familiar with the time, the place and the people mentioned, to at least a degree strong enough to make their names, actions and contributions ring true to me.  While never having read any of his work, Jack Kerouac is a name I&#8217;m very familiar with, as is William S. Burroughs, and while I didn&#8217;t know all the surrounding circumstances, I was at least familiar with the murder of David Kammerer.I knew it happened, and that Lucien Carr was responsible.For me, a film like &#8216;Kill Your Darlings&#8217; works almost for the same reason that it doesn&#8217;t work.  It is, in essence, two separate films wedged together to create something that resembles a whole film, but because of that it steps away from the obvious at times long enough to create something that feels more stimulating.  While it does deal with the murder itself, and the relationships that surround the people involved (either through actions or knowledge), the film is steeped in something bigger than that.And yet, one can easily fault the film for spreading itself too thin in an attempt to cover more than necessary, for some of the issues it claims to consider wind up feeling very lost in the shuffle.It&#8217;s a mixed bag, and so is this review.First, I&#8217;ll lay out everything I liked about this.  Dane DeHane delivers one of the truest &#8216;star is born&#8217; performances I&#8217;ve seen since Jude Law in &#8216;The Talented Mr. Ripley&#8217;, and quite frankly the performance itself felt very similar.  He is so electric on the screen, so &#8216;in your face&#8217; and yet so fragile and complicated and so much more than he seems.  He handles every complexity within Lucien Carr with such finesse.  His tantrums, his introverted fears, his outlandish attention-seeking whorishness, his complete ability to engulf a room; all of these facets make this such a marvelously layered and commanding performance.  Speaking of Carr, I felt like his sub-plot, in all of its facets, felt the most grounded.  The development, however unsettled, of his relationship with Krammerer and with Kurouac and with Ginsberg all felt like they had such rich detail and identity, and all of them felt unique and complete in their own right.  In fact, the entire ensemble was so well composed.  Foster, Hall, Huston and even Radcliffe (although he was easily the least interesting aspect of the film) are all up to the task here.  Radcliffe was certainly eager to shed any inkling of Harry Potter, and he did so with dignity intact.Sadly, the least successful aspect of the film is the construction of the Beat Generation itself.  While these men are all so interesting in their own right (especially Carr and Kerouac), their established &#8216;generation&#8217; felt so lazily put together and not entirely complete.  By the film&#8217;s end, I was struggling to understand what made their cause so special, or really what their cause was all about (other than offending the world with literature considered vile).  This is an issue, because it feels underdeveloped in an area that needed the most development.Still, as a character study, this is pretty dynamic in so many different ways, and watching Ginsberg soak in the people in his life, feeding off of them in order to find his own identity was pretty alarming and rewarding.  As an ensemble, it is also really strong.  I just wish that it worked as strongly as a statement on the times, because then it would have felt as well-rounded as it wanted to be.",4,Frayed with meaning&#8230;,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,3719,"['will', 'admit', 'am', 'not', 'entirely', 'familiar', 'Beat', 'Generation', 'fact', 'hadn', '8217', 'even', 'heard', 'term', 'knowing', 'names', 'involved', 'saw', 'film', 'How', 'embarrassing', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'familiar', 'time', 'place', 'people', 'mentioned', 'least', 'degree', 'strong', 'enough', 'make', 'names', 'actions', 'contributions', 'ring', 'true', 'never', 'having', 'read', 'work', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'name', '8217', 'very', 'familiar', 'William', 'S.', 'Burroughs', 'didn', '8217', 'know', 'surrounding', 'circumstances', 'was', 'least', 'familiar', 'murder', 'David', 'Kammerer.I', 'knew', 'happened', 'Lucien', 'Carr', 'was', 'responsible.For', 'film', '8216', 'Kill', 'Your', 'Darlings', '8217', 'almost', 'same', 'reason', '8217', 't', 'work', 'essence', 'two', 'separate', 'films', 'wedged', 'together', 'create', 'something', 'whole', 'film', 'away', 'obvious', 'times', 'long', 'enough', 'create', 'something', 'more', 'stimulating', 'deal', 'murder', 'relationships', 'surround', 'people', 'involved', 'actions', 'knowledge', 'film', 'steeped', 'something', 'bigger', 'that.And', 'yet', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'fault', 'film', 'spreading', 'too', 'thin', 'attempt', 'cover', 'more', 'necessary', 'issues', 'consider', 'wind', 'up', 'feeling', 'very', 'lost', 'shuffle.It', '8217', 's', 'mixed', 'bag', 'so', 'review.First', '8217', 'lay', 'out', 'everything', 'liked', 'Dane', 'DeHane', 'one', 'truest', '8216', 'star', 'born', '8217', 'performances', '8217', 'seen', 'Jude', 'Law', '8216', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', '8217', 'quite', 'frankly', 'performance', 'felt', 'very', 'similar', 'so', 'electric', 'screen', 'so', '8216', 'face', '8217', 'yet', 'so', 'fragile', 'complicated', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'complexity', 'Lucien', 'Carr', 'such', 'finesse', 'tantrums', 'introverted', 'fears', 'outlandish', 'attention-seeking', 'whorishness', 'complete', 'ability', 'engulf', 'room', 'facets', 'make', 'such', 'marvelously', 'layered', 'commanding', 'performance', 'Speaking', 'Carr', 'felt', 'sub-plot', 'facets', 'felt', 'most', 'grounded', 'development', 'however', 'unsettled', 'relationship', 'Krammerer', 'Kurouac', 'Ginsberg', 'felt', 'had', 'such', 'rich', 'detail', 'identity', 'felt', 'unique', 'complete', 'own', 'right', 'fact', 'entire', 'ensemble', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'composed', 'Foster', 'Hall', 'Huston', 'even', 'Radcliffe', 'was', 'easily', 'least', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'are', 'up', 'task', 'here', 'Radcliffe', 'was', 'certainly', 'eager', 'shed', 'inkling', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'did', 'so', 'dignity', 'intact.Sadly', 'least', 'successful', 'aspect', 'film', 'construction', 'Beat', 'Generation', 'men', 'are', 'so', 'interesting', 'own', 'right', 'especially', 'Carr', 'Kerouac', 'established', '8216', 'generation', '8217', 'felt', 'so', 'lazily', 'put', 'together', 'not', 'entirely', 'complete', 'film', '8217', 's', 'end', 'was', 'struggling', 'understand', 'what', 'made', 'cause', 'special', 'really', 'what', 'cause', 'was', 'other', 'offending', 'world', 'literature', 'considered', 'vile', 'issue', 'underdeveloped', 'area', 'needed', 'most', 'development.Still', 'character', 'study', 'pretty', 'dynamic', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'watching', 'Ginsberg', 'soak', 'people', 'life', 'feeding', 'order', 'find', 'own', 'identity', 'was', 'pretty', 'alarming', 'rewarding', 'ensemble', 'also', 'really', 'strong', 'just', 'wish', 'worked', 'as', 'strongly', 'statement', 'times', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'as', 'well-rounded', 'wanted', 'be']",N/A

1659474,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B00DN3S3GY,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[2, 2]","I'm not certain that the real life story this film is based on is well known. I was doing some research on the Beat poets/writers when I was in grad school and came across an isolated story about a man named Lucjen Carr killing one David Kammerer. Carr used as his defense the claim that Kammerer had been sexually pursuing him. In the end Carr got a slap on the hand, a lot of sympathy, and a short stint in jail. He went on to become a wire service editor of some reknown and found the time to father the brilliant writer Caleb Carr. The probably most interesting aspect to this story was the homosexual ramifications of the case.This film is based on the experiences of writer/poet Allen Ginsburg and his meeting Carr while both were students at Columbia University. While it does not center exclusively on the crime itself, it blends the story of the growing friendship of Carr and Ginsberg and the other Beat writers who came together at the time and Kammerer's growing obsession with Carr.I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I popped this into my DVR, but it became rapidly apparent why this film didn't appear in a lot of theaters near my home. It was cerebral in a way that is not exactly main stream and would no doubt anger some people despite the fact that the principles all portrayed in the movie are dead.Despite the film's darkness and moodiness, I really liked it and found it fascinating. The performances were top notch and the characterizations were well defined and thought out.As for Ginsberg, I met him at a symposium once celebrating the poet William Blake. He was a fascinating older gay man with a ton of charisma and didn't seem dark or suicidal.  This movie and its portrayal of Ginsberg stood in stark contrast to my momentary impression.

1659477,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00DN3S3GY,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","{4.25 stars}First off, I'm sure that there are discrepancies between this film and the real story of the Columbia University love-triangle of Allen Ginsburg, Lucien Carr, and David Kammerer. I'm judging KILL YOUR DARLINGS according to story-value, not historical accuracy.KILL YOUR DARLINGS is well-filmed and well-played, and Daniel Radcliffe is particularly memorable as the young Allen Ginsburg. It shows a great deal about how he was influenced and changed by the early Columbia ""Beat"" circle of Burroughs, Kerouac, and others such as Carr whose names, for various reasons, have been largely forgotten. It realistically evokes the 1940s, and the story of WWII is skillfully paralleled with that of the young writers' circle. Their college-boy pretensions, which, nevertheless, have real sincerity behind them, also shine through very well. Coincidentally, it's intriguing to see the horribly inconsistent laws regarding homosexuals, as well as the level of ""in loco parentis"" control universities wielded at the time.Not to sound snooty, but one needs some basic familiarity with the major literary characters and the Beat movement in general in order to really appreciate and enjoy this film. Those who aren't into fiction and poetry of the sort written by these characters may be rather bored with KILL YOUR DARLINGS. Otherwise, while there are a few patchy spots, the whole tale of the antics, jealousies, and everything else that happens in the young libertine writers' circle, ending with a murder and the dilemmas that follow, makes for a gripping and very intelligent movie.",4,"""Find where love hides--Live, share, lose"" Allen Ginsburg",1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,1585,"['4.25', 'stars', 'First', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'discrepancies', 'film', 'real', 'story', 'Columbia', 'University', 'love-triangle', 'Allen', 'Ginsburg', 'Lucien', 'Carr', 'David', 'Kammerer', ""'m"", 'judging', 'KILL', 'YOUR', 'DARLINGS', 'according', 'story-value', 'not', 'historical', 'YOUR', 'DARLINGS', 'well-filmed', 'well-played', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'young', 'Allen', 'Ginsburg', 'great', 'deal', 'how', 'was', 'influenced', 'changed', 'early', 'Columbia', 'Beat', 'circle', 'Burroughs', 'Kerouac', 'others', 'such', 'Carr', 'names', 'various', 'reasons', 'have', 'been', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'realistically', '1940s', 'story', 'WWII', 'skillfully', 'paralleled', 'young', 'writers', 'circle', 'college-boy', 'pretensions', 'nevertheless', 'have', 'real', 'sincerity', 'also', 'shine', 'very', 'well', 'Coincidentally', 'intriguing', 'see', 'horribly', 'inconsistent', 'laws', 'regarding', 'homosexuals', 'as', 'well', 'level', 'loco', 'parentis', 'control', 'wielded', 'time.Not', 'sound', 'snooty', 'one', 'basic', 'familiarity', 'major', 'literary', 'characters', 'Beat', 'movement', 'general', 'order', 'really', 'appreciate', 'enjoy', 'film', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fiction', 'poetry', 'sort', 'written', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'rather', 'bored', 'KILL', 'YOUR', 'DARLINGS', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'few', 'patchy', 'spots', 'whole', 'tale', 'antics', 'jealousies', 'everything', 'else', 'young', 'libertine', 'writers', 'circle', 'ending', 'murder', 'dilemmas', 'follow', 'gripping', 'very', 'intelligent', 'movie']",N/A

Imagine, an old Beatnik like me, acquaintance of Allen Ginsberg, huge fan of Daniel Radcliffe--and here's a biopic about Ginsberg, played by Radcliffe. DREAMLAND! ... I was right and wrong ....Well, to be blunt and sweet: the film hits all the right notes as an artistic/period production. There is something missing--Capotewas suffused with it (see my review), this wasn't--but what there is leaps out pleasantly. Set at the time when a young Ginsberg was just off to Columbia, the remainder of this is not so impressive. It is, to be perfectly frank, a huge bore except for the stunning performances.Radcliffe is growing as an artist, and I would expect to see him in something like this at this stage of his career. The problem is, this film should have been about theHowl and Other Poems (City Lights Pocket Poets, No. 4)trial, and about far more important things than it presents. Many will disagree with me: a reviewer must press on. This film is trivial, a showcase for some pretty faces (plus a woefully miscast Jack Kerouac).The story here, that of Lucien Carr's commission of murder, is one I know vaguely and did not want to know about any further. Hence the idea I always had that any film about Ginsberg would concentrate first onHowl, and Other Poems, then on the characters. This film is a yes-no proposition for me and I will be even more honest: I refused to watch any more of it after about 90 minutes or a bit less. I'd had enough, even Radcliffe's presence being unable to sustain me any longer.Get it if you must; there is no other film quite like it and as I said, it has value. Perhaps I am missing something and it is a great film ... but it will never be a classic, nor do I think it will even be remembered except as another Radcliffe jumping-off point.",3,I'd like to HOWL at the dummy who picked this era of Ginsberg's life,1405814400,"07 20, 2014",2014,1883,"['KILL', 'YOUR', 'DARLINGS', 'seemed', 'film', 'slop', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'released', 'thus', 'far', '2014', 'Imagine', 'old', 'Beatnik', 'acquaintance', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'huge', 'fan', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'here', 'biopic', 'Ginsberg', 'played', 'Radcliffe', 'DREAMLAND', 'was', 'right', 'wrong', '.Well', 'be', 'blunt', 'sweet', 'film', 'right', 'notes', 'artistic/period', 'production', 'something', 'missing', 'Capotewas', 'suffused', 'see', 'review', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'leaps', 'out', 'pleasantly', 'Set', 'time', 'when', 'young', 'Ginsberg', 'was', 'just', 'Columbia', 'remainder', 'not', 'so', 'impressive', 'be', 'perfectly', 'frank', 'huge', 'bore', 'stunning', 'performances.Radcliffe', 'growing', 'artist', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'something', 'stage', 'career', 'problem', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'theHowl', 'Other', 'Poems', 'City', 'Lights', 'Pocket', 'Poets', 'No', '4', 'trial', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'Many', 'will', 'disagree', 'reviewer', 'must', 'press', 'film', 'trivial', 'showcase', 'pretty', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', '.The', 'story', 'here', 'Lucien', 'Carr', 'commission', 'murder', 'one', 'know', 'vaguely', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'know', 'further', 'Hence', 'idea', 'always', 'had', 'film', 'Ginsberg', 'would', 'concentrate', 'first', 'onHowl', 'Other', 'Poems', 'then', 'characters', 'film', 'yes-no', 'proposition', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'honest', 'refused', 'watch', 'more', '90', 'minutes', 'bit', 'less', ""'d"", 'had', 'enough', 'even', 'Radcliffe', 'presence', 'being', 'unable', 'sustain', 'longer.Get', 'must', 'other', 'film', 'quite', 'said', 'value', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'missing', 'something', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'classic', 'do', 'think', 'will', 'even', 'be', 'remembered', 'Radcliffe', 'jumping-off', 'point']",N/A

Kill Your Darlings solves that with a script and characterizations that make these counter-culture/subversives relateable and comprehensible while still giving us the essence of them.  The film tries to do a lot, although handling scenes in short attention span deftness. It is all at once about the start of the counter-culture revolution in American Literature, The Beat Generation. It's about the coming together of these boys and the impetus that started their evolution; the pieces that clicked and sparked an outcome that changed things forever. It's about a murder and Ginsbergs coming out. It's about influence, obsession and loss. It's about how those boys challenged norms, and morality and the lengths people feel they have to go to be understood and freed. It's a glimpse into how suppression of human nature, creativity and spirit, even through nurtured cultural and educational herding from the most well intentioned institutions will likely cause a boil over. All of these themes were handled fine by me; they're barely touched on, just enough to make a point but lack a cohesive thread, a map of sorts. This kept me a bit at a distance emotionally. By all accounts the real Lucian Carr possessed an engaging, influential quality that enraptured people within the circles he ran. Dane DeHaan, though a fine actor, does not seem to possess those qualities, nor portray them well. The film is handled well enough to make it moot. Ben Foster is a favorite actor of mine. His William Burroughs was one note and obvious. Even though Burroughs was a great friend of David Kammerer, his pivotal moments in the story bear little weight. Whoever played Kourac made him barely matter at all. That all said the story is well told, from the perspective of a Ginsburg unexpectedly well played by Daniel Ratcliff. Ratcliff doesn't so much transform; (although better than James Franco in Howl) he fit the part REALLY well. The production looks top notch. Though missing a connection for all things, pacing steadily escalates climbing with layered plotting and atmospheric cinematography. Don't credit the characterizations nor events as historically accurate.

1659482,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00DN3S3GY,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","Director and co-writer (with Austin Bunn) John Krokidas have created an atmospheric visit to the beginnings of one of literary history's great movements - the Beat Generation - and in doing so have carved a fine story that combines not only the rise of the Beats but also examines the slow emergence of recognition of sexual identity crises, in both a positive and a critical manner. Cast with a group of very fine actors and accompanied with musical director Nico Muhly's sensitive score that includes the references to Brahms symphonies and trios and transcriptions of themes along with terrific excerpts from Harlem's jazz scene (courtesy of Dawn Newman as a jazz singer), this film is successful on many levels, not the least of which is the reminder of the permanent impact on American literature and sociology imprinted by the likes of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William Burroughs. The very sensitive opening sequence, appreciated only at film's end, sets the dark tone of the film and opens the window to understanding the Beats (also called ""the Libertine Circle"" by Ginsberg).The time is the mid 1940s and Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliff) is an English major in Columbia University, assigned to be the roommate of Lucien 'Make me cry or make me horny' Carr (Dane DeHann) who awakens Ginsberg's rebellious self and introduces him to the work of Rimbaud. Dissatisfied by the orthodox attitudes of the school, Ginsberg finds himself drawn to iconoclastic colleagues like the egotistical but genius Lucien Carr, William S. Burroughs (Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston). Together, this gang would explore bold new literary ideas that would challenge Columbia University's staid stance and the sensibilities of their time as the future Beat Generation. However, for all their creativity, their very appetites and choices lead to more serious transgressions that would mark their lives forever. Lucien has been stalked since age 14 by the older gay David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall) who sees Lucien as his lover, but in this version of the story Lucien acted out his same sex proclivities with both Ginsberg and Kerouac. Lucien murders Kammerer and drags his body into the Hudson River (recall the  opening scene of the film) and it is the advice of both Kerouac and Burroughs that leads to the judgment of the questionable verdict. Ginsberg goes on to create `Howl' and Kerouac moves toward `On the Road' and Carr becomes a journalist. Despite the at times confusing dichotomy between the murder story and the literary awakening the Beats introduced, this is a fascinating depiction of a movement of enormous impact.John Krokidas captures all the essence of the times in the 1940s New York City and his actors - especially Daniel Radcliff - bring this story to life. There is an uncredited role of Lucien Carr's mother superbly played by Kyra Sedgwick and any number of other fleeting bit parts that add to the mystique of the period. Recommended on many levels.

1659488,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00DN3S3GY,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","A film that was expected by many people, because of an actor who were getting out of a teenage part that had lasted six or seven years, like Daniel Radcliffe, or an actor surviving a long series, and his own cancer, like Michael C. Hall. But as for me the main reason was the subject of that film, the birth of the beat generation, the meeting of the main protagonists of the beat generation to be and become. We are in 1943 and we meet young students at Columbia University in New York. They are all going to be the writers and poets of that post war lost generation that will beat their guilt out of their minds and beat us down into our own guilt.We all know Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs and Lucien Carr. It is true the fifth character of this pentacle, David Kammerer, is not really known for what he has achieved in his own life, what he has left behind under his own name. He just was the English teacher who fell in love with his pupil Lucien Carr who fell in love too but as a teenager who had to grow out of this pubescent love and did not know how to do it, especially since David Kammerer did not know he had to yield and step away. Instead of that he followed the young man and haunted him.Our four future poets and writers  were all in breaking rules and experimenting all kinds of strange things, drugs, morphine, alcohol of course, marihuana, but also the excitement and thrill they could get out of violating some good old standards in their society, like sexual taboos and rejected sexual orientations. But they all had to break themselves, to collide into one another and bruise, hurt and even dismantle one another and themselves. It looks as if their future talent had to be born in the blood of a sacrificed innocent man whose sole crime was to love one of them excessively, obsessively, compulsively. That's the most dramatic and unexplainable fact in their lives and careers. They all needed that death to become. I just hope they were haunted by their guilt till the end of their own lives.Strangely enough their society was lenient, even for the actual murderer, and that can be explained easily by the fact that David Kammerer was gay and their society at the time was definitely and irredeemably antigay. Lucien Carr could have pleaded non guilty because David Kammerer being a homosexual, he had the right to defend his honor and kill him. But Allan Ginsberg, definitely, and Jack Kerouac more or less, not to speak of William Burroughs who was retrieved and taken away by his own father, had to tell the truth in a way or another, and to let everyone, and Lucien Carr first of all, know the truth: Lucien Carr was in love with David Kammerer, which made him a homosexual too. He thus had to accept the verdict of murder in the first degree. And yet he only got eighteen months of probationary detention. Quite cheap for the life of a man, even a homosexual!But what remains the real truth for us is that these four poets and writers found their inspiration and force in those mixed orientations and in that crime, described in all its ugliness: discover the details in the film itself. And we are shown the horror twice, plus told about it in full detail one third time, along with the first visual demonstration. No way for us not to know the obsessive and compulsive obligation, necessity, impulse, desire and even fascination to commit that murder, to kill that man, slowly and systematically, as some kind of a last final commitment to each other till death them part and death, inflicted by the young man to the older man, does part them.We will say it is very romantic to find one's artistic inspiration in one's suffering, but here that romanticism is sadistic since they find their inspiration in the suffering they inflict onto one another, including onto an outsider who tries to stick to their small circle of . . . what can we call them? Friends? I doubt it.The film is packed with fast action, rich piles of artifacts and props, and the actors are all quite seasoned in their guilt and non-repentance, the non-repentance of some crocodiles shedding tears on the suffering of others when they only shed tears on their own misery which is no misery at all since anyway they will be able to use their families or their connections to get through. The film does not in any way acclaim, applaud and approve of this beat generation, but it rather shows how they were lost because they were from more or less well off families: they hated it but they used it skillfully in order to avoid punishment or to get a second chance. The only one who really did it with his own hands is Jack Kerouac, but he was like the fifth wheel of a wagon, the one who took part but did not really belong.But the film also contains some easy symbolism like showing William Burroughs shooting himself with morphine, Allen Ginsberg being sexually penetrated by some unknown outsider he had accidently picked in the street, and Lucien Carr repeatedly stabbing David Kammerer. It is easy and it is also farfetched as if drug addiction, gay sex and killing a gay partner were the same thing, as if gay orientation led necessarily to anal sex shown on the screen, a syringe in your arm and a knife in the chest of your lover, the three at the same time and in close and dense succession. It even could sound like exposure more than fair presentation. Is the film ambiguous about this beat generation?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Blood sacrifice for the beat generation,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",2014,5449,"['film', 'was', 'expected', 'many', 'people',

The movie covers only a short period of time in the lives of the Beat writers, and includes the pivotal event which helped to shape their future and provide a significant foundation for their future literary work.Kill Your Darlings begins with Allen Ginsberg (played by Daniel Radcliffe) enrolling at Columbia University and meeting Lucien Carr (played by Dane DeHaan). Lucien Carr then introduces Ginsberg to David Kammerer (played by Michael C Hall), William S Burroughs (played by Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (played by Jack Huston). The phrase &#34;Kill Your Darlings&#34; is a quote from Faulkner and refers to the need to not get too attached to one's written words. The quote is cited by the professor in one of the first writing classes attended by Ginsberg. Ginsberg asks a question during the class and is instantly put down by the professor; the students are to listen and do what they're told, as the alternative is to quit school and go to war (it's the middle of WWII).During the first part of the film, we see the young men getting to know each other at parties and long alcohol and drug-infused sessions where they decry the status quo, criticize their professors and the establishment and try to articulate a &#34;new vision&#34;. Some of the scenes of debauchery are manic and wild, particularly the one where they slash through the pages of books, tear out pages and nail them to the wall. There is an unspoken hint of homosexuality between several of the men, but particularly the stalking of Lucien by Kammerer. These two appear to be co-dependent and oddly connected, which causes Ginsberg to be quite jealous. Lucien is the blonde-haired, blue-eyed charismatic center of the group and he always gets his way.The actors are all very convincing in their roles, but I still can't help but see Harry Potter in Daniel Radcliffe. Perhaps as he ages and looks less like the adolescent, Harry will fade away...

Suddenly enigmatic toss-offs like &#34;dropped out of Columbia after a couple of years and reunited with school mates later to become The Beats&#34; are given real substance. Excellent script. Excellent acting. Excellent attention to all sorts of cinematic details that make the narrative flow smoothly from beginning to end. And, perhaps most telling, more interesting with each additional viewing. Perhaps most telling, for me, is the fact that this story reflects my personal experience in college. I knew young men and women who were as hell-bent on turning the world upside down, giving their pointless existence a real sense of purpose--however artificially manufactured in their minds from the remnants of thinkers of the past like Baudelaire and Yeats. And I was even involved in an obsessive relationship every bit as intense as that of David and Lucien but, quite by accident, without tragic results.

There are certain subjects that film makers, writers and other artists have as deeply held convictions on as the most religious zealot to stand on a pulpit proclaiming his faith. The difference is that most of these artistic zealots believe in their art above all else and hold the men who influence them as sacred. It's the same reason we yearly have millionaires awarding other millionaires awards on TV.The case in point this time around is the author Allen Ginsberg, a poet that many have proclaimed to be the voice of his generation, a generation known at the beat generation. I'm sorry but if you have to call yourself part of a group while saying people shouldn't be part of a group, you're pretentious. Ginsberg was a member of that same group of people that included both Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs. All are involved in the release of KILL YOUR DARLINGS.This true story begins with Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliff) heading off to college where his world completely changes. On a tour of the library for freshmen he is witness to an outburst by bad boy Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan). In class he immediately starts off by disagreeing with his professor about the dynamics of how poetry should be written which catches the eye of Carr. Soon Ginsberg is recruited into the world of Carr.Rather than follow along with the standard things people do in college like sporting events, lectures or pep rallies (the film takes place in the 40's), Ginsberg is led down into a seedier world near Harlem by Carr. He is exposed to jazz and blues music, drinking & drugs and the intelligentsia of society. At a party he meets Burroughs (Ben Foster), lying in a dry bathtub inhaling nitrous oxide. He also meets the host of the party, David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), holding realm over the rest and seemingly having a controlling eye on Carr.The immediate friendship between Ginsberg, Carr and Burroughs develops as they come up with a concept, a manifesto if you will, about the change that is to come in art and society, a new vision. Led by Carr who offers up ideas left and right, Ginsberg is so caught up in the moment that he fails to realize that Carr has rarely if ever come upon an idea on his own. Hints are dropped everywhere that most if not all of his ideas come from Kammerer. As the movie progresses we soon discover that Kammerer does indeed have a hold over Carr. The most obvious hold is that he writes all of Carr's papers for his classes. The other is that he has involved Carr in a homosexual relationship; a relationship not only frowned upon at the time but illegal as well.Through it all Ginsberg remains oblivious on the surface. At the same time he's developing his own crush on Carr. Never involved in a relationship prior Ginsberg feels his developing homosexuality grow the more involved he becomes with Carr.The three friends ramble on about art and how they will change the world. They bring Carr's friend Jack Kerouac into their plans. They display their rebellion in acts like breaking into the library and replacing rare display case books with erotic books kept locked up. They fail to go to class and yet consider themselves part of the University, intent on changing it all the while. Always hanging on is Kammerer, trying to control Carr while Ginsberg begins to do all in his power to part the two. Eventually the conflict that develops will end in murder and revelations for all as to who they truly are.The worshipfulness on display by the screenwriter and director for the beat generation runs rampant here. It's as if they feel these characters can do no wrong no matter what they do, as if they are the cool kids that they so long wanted to be. The same holds true for the actors, especially Radcliff. Why is it that child stars always seem to leap towards roles that require them to either undress or do &#34;adult&#34; things to prove they are truly actors? Radcliff has done nudity on stage and here offers us a gay lovemaking scene that while not showing the entire act leaves little to the imagination. Straight sex scenes in movies have become boring. Gay sex scenes to me seem done for little more than shock value.In the end I couldn't recommend this film to anyone with the exception of the gay community who will proclaim it a standard by which all films should be made. It will also be a film that those who criticize will find themselves called homophobic over. There are some truly great movies made concerning the topic of homosexuality and offering an understanding viewpoint. This is not one of them. From a movie standpoint to me it was boring and felt as if it was in love with itself. Not even a quick finger on the remote's fast forward button can save this one.",1,ELITISTS ENTERTAINMENT,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,4837,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'movies', 'are', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', '34', 'artistic', 'integrity', '34', 'be', 'entertaining', 'are', 'certain', 'subjects', 'film', 'makers', 'writers', 'other', 'artists', 'have', 'deeply', 'held', 'convictions', 'most', 'religious', 'zealot', 'stand', 'pulpit', 'proclaiming', 'faith', 'difference', 'most', 'artistic', 'zealots', 'believe', 'art', 'else', 'hold', 'men', 'who', 'influence', 'sacred', 'same', 'reason', 'yearly', 'have', 'millionaires', 'awarding', 'other', 'millionaires', 'awards', 'TV.The', 'case', 'point', 'time', 'around', 'author', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'poet', 'many', 'have', 'proclaimed', 'be', 'voice', 'generation', 'generation', 'known', 'beat', 'generation', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'have', 'call', 'part', 'group', 'saying', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'part', 'group', ""'re"", 'pretentious', 'Ginsberg', 'was', 'member', 'same', 'group', 'people', 'included', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'William', 'Burroughs', 'are', 'involved', 'release', 'KILL', 'YOUR', 'DARLINGS.This', 'true', 'story', 'Ginsberg', 'Daniel', 'Radcliff', 'heading', 'off', 'college', 'where', 'world', 'completely', 'changes', 'tour', 'library', 'freshmen', 'witness', 'outburst', 'bad', 'boy', 'Lucien', 'Carr', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'class', 'immediately', 'disagreeing', 'professor', 'dynamics', 'how', 'poetry', 'should', 'be', 'written', 'eye', 'Carr', 'Soon', 'Ginsberg', 'recruited', 'world', 'Carr.Rather', 'follow', 'standard', 'things', 'people', 'do', 'college', 'sporting', 'events', 'lectures', 'pep', 'rallies', 'film', 'place', '40', 'Ginsberg', 'led', 'down', 'seedier', 'world', 'Harlem', 'Carr', 'exposed', 'jazz', 'blues', 'music', 'drinking', 'drugs', 'intelligentsia', 'society', 'party', 'Burroughs', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'lying', 'dry', 'bathtub', 'inhaling', 'nitrous', 'oxide', 'also', 'host', 'party', 'David', 'Kammerer', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'holding', 'realm', 'rest', 'seemingly', 'having', 'controlling', 'eye', 'Carr.The', 'immediate', 'friendship', 'Ginsberg', 'Carr', 'Burroughs', 'come', 'up', 'concept', 'manifesto', 'will', 'change', 'come', 'art', 'society', 'new', 'vision', 'Led', 'Carr', 'who', 'up', 'ideas', 'left', 'right', 'Ginsberg', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'moment', 'realize', 'Carr', 'rarely', 'ever', 'come', 'idea', 'own', 'Hints', 'are', 'dropped', 'everywhere', 'most', 'not', 'ideas', 'come', 'Kammerer', 'movie', 'soon', 'discover', 'Kammerer', 'indeed', 'have', 'hold', 'over', 'Carr', 'most', 'obvious', 'hold', 'Carr', 'papers', 'classes', 'other', 'involved', 'Carr', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'relationship', 'not', 'only', 'frowned', 'time', 'illegal', 'Ginsberg', 'oblivious', 'surface', 'same', 'time', 'developing', 'own', 'crush', 'Carr', 'Never', 'involved', 'relationship', 'prior', 'Ginsberg', 'developing', 'homosexuality', 'grow', 'more', 'involved', 'Carr.The', 'three', 'friends', 'ramble', 'art', 'how', 'will', 'change', 'world', 'bring', 'Carr', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'plans', 'display', 'rebellion', 'acts', 'breaking', 'library', 'replacing', 'rare', 'display', 'case', 'books', 'erotic', 'books', 'kept', 'locked', 'up', 'fail', 'go', 'class', 'yet', 'consider', 'part', 'University', 'intent', 'changing', 'while', 'hanging', 'Kammerer', 'trying', 'control', 'Carr', 'Ginsberg', 'do', 'power', 'part', 'two', 'Eventually', 'conflict', 'will', 'end', 'murder', 'revelations', 'who', 'truly', 'are.The', 'worshipfulness', 'display', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'beat', 'generation', 'rampant', 'here', 'feel', 'characters', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'are', 'cool', 'kids', 'so', 'long', 'wanted', 'be', 'same', 'true', 'actors', 'especially', 'Radcliff', 'Why', 'stars', 'always', 'seem', 'leap', 'towards', 'require', 'either', 'undress', 'do', '34', 'adult', '34', 'things', 'prove', 'are', 'truly', 'actors', 'Radcliff', 'done', 'nudity', 'stage', 'here', 'gay', 'lovemaking', 'scene', 'not', 'showing', 'entire', 'act', 'little', 'imagination', 'Straight', 'sex', 'scenes', 'movies', 'have', 'become', 'boring', 'Gay', 'sex', 'scenes', 'seem', 'done', 'little', 'more', 'shock', 'end', 'could', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'exception', 'gay', 'community', 'who', 'will', 'proclaim', 'standard', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'film', 'who', 'criticize', 'will', 'find', 'called', 'homophobic', 'are', 'truly', 'great', 'movies', 'made', 'concerning', 'topic', 'homosexuality', 'offering', 'understanding', 'viewpoint', 'not', 'one', 'movie', 'standpoint', 'was', 'boring', 'felt', 'was', 'love', 'Not', 'even', 'quick', 'finger', 'remote', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'can', 'save', 'one']",N/A

The 2013 film brings the story of how the Beat generation got its not-so-humble start, when in the mid-1940s Allen Ginsberg (played by Daniel Radcliffe), then a freshman at Columbia University, gets to know and befriend Jack Kerouac (played by Jack Huston) as well as William S. Burroughs (played by Ben Foster). The movie actually felt like two-movies-in-one. The first part of the movie shows us how these three, along with a few more characters, start dreaming up what would eventually be known as the Beat generation. The basic formula of that seemed to have been: cause as much havoc as possible (at one point one of them concludes: &#34;we have a duty to break the law!&#34;, as if that makes it okay), go to lots of night clubs in Harlem to check out the latest jazz combo, and smoke lots and lots of cigarettes (and take in a few not-quite-so-legal things as well). The second part of the movie centers around the troubled relationship between Lucien Carr (played by Dane DeHaan) and David Kammerer (played by Michael C. Hall) on the one hand, and Ginsberg's own relationship with Carr on the other hand. To tell you much more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: as between the 2-in-1 films, I was not particularly drawn in with the first part of the movie, as it all felt very forced (I kept thinking: look at them trying hard to act drunk when they really aren't!). But it is the second part of the film that really pulled me in and caught my attention (and then kept it through the end). The events portrayed in the film are based on true events, so perhaps you know what is going to happen. If you don't, no worries, I'm not going to spoil anything. Just be ready to be surprised, more than once even. The acting performances are quite good, in particular Dane DeHaan, but check out also a couple of small roles from Elizabeth Olsen as Kerouac's girlfriend Edie, hard to believe that she is still only 24, I can't wait to see more of her; and also Jennifer Jason Leigh as Allen Ginsberg's unstable mom. When watching this, you can't help but think back to that other Beat generation movie from last year, &#34;On The Road&#34; (based on the Kerouac book). In the end, they are very different movies, and both worth checking out. Make sure you don't walk out of the theatre or turn off the DVD as soon as the end credits start rolling. Not only do we get to hear the Libertines' &#34;Don't Look back Into the Sun&#34; as the credits roll, but even better is that we get to see actual photos from the early days of the Beat generation.This movie debuted to nice critical acclaim at the 2013 Sundance film festival, and I have been looking forward to seeing it.

Good, bad, or otherwise.I have to tell you, I was blown away.Stellar performances by Daniel Radcliffe, Dane DeHaan, and Michael C. Hall. Several things crossed my mind while I watched this movie. First and somewhat comical was a phrase by the Divine Miss M &#34;People were doing it long before we ever thought about it.&#34;Odd thing to think about I know when watching a story about Allen Ginsberg, however, the debauchery and drug abuse that went on, I was like &#34;wow&#34;.Second thing that crossed my mind was not one time while watching this movie did I not truly think that it was the 1940's. fascinating time for music, which by the way was great.Something that actually took me by surprise was that Allen Ginsberg was part of the same &#34;rat pack&#34; so to speak as Jack Kerouac, the man who wrote &#34;On the Road&#34;, which by the way was an awesome story in it's own right. However, It did not occur to me that the Jack portrayed in the movie was the same man. Not until the very end of the movie was I enlightened to that fact.Another thing that, I will not say was a downer so to speak, and literally was just moments in the movie, was the judiciary view on homosexuality. I was like wow, really? your kidding me.Over all. A very well made movie. Fascinating story that held my interest. Stunning performances. Awesome recreation of the 1940's.

1659507,A2EK4SOCZCYNVK,B00DN3S3GY,"Robert Chadwick ""robbchadwick""","[31, 32]","Kill Your Darlings is one of the best films of 2013 and certainly the most interesting film that I've seen regarding the group of individuals collectively referred to as The Beats. It has recently been released on DVD and video (for rent or purchase). The movie covers only a short period of time in their lives which includes the pivotal event which helped to shape their future and provide a significant contribution to their future literary work.Kill Your Darlings begins with Allen Ginsberg (played by Daniel Radcliffe) enrolling at Columbia University and meeting Lucien Carr (played by Dane DeHaan). Lucien Carr then introduces Ginsberg to David Kammerer (played by Michael C Hall), William S Burroughs (played by Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (played by Jack Huston). During the first part of the film, we see them interact in ways that gives us insight into their thought processes and their unique approach to the world. This is an interesting introduction to The Beats; but it is not the main subject of this film.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! If you are not familiar with the murder of David Kammerer or prefer to see the film before knowing more about it, stop reading now; but please come back once you've seen the film to read more. Comments and discussion are always welcome.Lucien Carr was nineteen years old when he murdered David Kammerer who was approximately fifteen years his senior. The two formed a close relationship when Lucien was only fourteen while both were living in St Louis. David Kammerer was obviously totally infatuated with Lucien Carr. That is not in dispute. Over the years as Lucien moved from school to school, David also moved to Lucien's new location so that he could be near the younger man. What is in dispute is Lucien's actual feelings about David Kammerer and the extent of their physical relationship. You will see many accounts which paint Kammerer as a stalker; but if you dig more deeply into the facts, it is apparent that Carr did not totally object to David's affection and did not seriously attempt to extricate himself from the relationship. In fact it is clear that regardless of the extent of their physical relationship, Lucien made ample use of Kammerer when it suited him.Let's get one sticky point out of the way right now. Fifteen years is a big age difference in any relationship; and it is certainly even more a problem when one of the two is a teenager. However, before assigning labels like child molestation, statutory rape or similar terms, I think we do need to remember the time period during which these events occurred. The legal age of consent was generally much lower at that time than it is today. In fact, it may surprise you to learn that until fairly recently fourteen was still the legal age of consent in a few states; fifteen was even more common. Today the age of consent has been raised in almost all states with sixteen being the most common. However, in the first and middle part of the twentieth century things were different. Young people grew up faster then. I'm certainly not suggesting that this was a good thing; but when we consider events from a different period of time, it may not be wise to judge them by current day standards.With that out of the way, let's continue by saying that over the years Lucien Carr accompanied David Kammerer on trips that included only the two of them and maintained a close relationship in several locales. As far as we know, Lucien never made a serious attempt to end the relationship or dissuade David in a very real way. Even though Lucien's mother did not approve of the relationship, she also did nothing terribly definitive toward ending it. When Lucien attempted to commit suicide the year before the events in this film unfold, David saved his life and was listed as the next of kin on the hospital admitting form.As Kill Your Darlings opens, it is 1944; and the locale is New York City. Lucien is nineteen and David is about thirty four. In some ways it does appear that Lucien is now finally ready to move on without David Kammerer in his life. Lucien makes new friends and complains about David to them. However, Lucien still allows David to be a part of his life. One of the first events in the film shows Lucien taking Allen Ginsberg to David's apartment to attend a party. In fact he continues to allow David to tag along with him and his new friends wherever they go. He uses David to write school papers for him. Lucien spends alone time with David and seems unsure whether he wants to actually remove David from his life. As events unfold, there comes a time when the two of them are on a walk alone together in a park on the upper west side of Manhattan where an argument occurs and Lucien stabs David in the chest several times with a knife. David is mortally wounded but not yet dead. Lucien weighs David down by placing rocks in his pockets and drags him into the Hudson River to drown. Lucien takes David's eyeglasses and the murder weapon with him.Lucien seeks advice from William S Burroughs, who advises Lucien to get a lawyer and turn himself in; but Lucien doesn't especially like that advice at the odd moment. He turns to Jack Kerouac who helps him dispose of the glasses and knife and accompanies Lucien on a day of drinking, museum visiting, cinema hopping and the like. Eventually Lucien does turn himself in, claims that the murder was a result of defending his honor against a homosexual advance and eventually gets a light sentence in a reformatory. (Did I mention that it was 1944? Homosexual panic was a much easier defense back then than it is today.)William S Burroughs and Jack Kerouac were also arrested as accessories. Things worked out even better for them as they spent little time in jail before making bail. Even though it is clear from their later writing about the crime that they were aware of the complexities of the case, they both decided that since David Kammerer was dead and Lucien Carr was alive, it was best to throw their support behind Lucien's defense and not raise any doubt about its authenticity.Lucien Carr served eighteen months for the murder of David Kammerer in a reformatory instead of a prison. He went on to become a respected journalist for UPI and was married and had children. He maintained his friendship with Ginsberg, Burroughs & Kerouac for the rest of their lives but never sought fame or recognition in the same way his friends did.Let us now turn to the final point of dispute. Was the relationship between Lucien Carr and David Kammerer a physical one? Kill Your Darlings unfolds from the point of view of Allen Ginsberg who certainly believed that the relationship between Kammerer and Carr either was or had been very physical. Ginsberg states in his memoirs and elsewhere that he also had a physical relationship with Lucien Carr during the first part of their friendship and provides other interesting personal observations regarding Lucien's relationships with men. William S Burroughs said that he did not believe the relationship between Kammerer and Carr was physical; but that statement may have been an attempt to help and reinforce Lucien Carr's honor defense for the murder of David Kammerer. We know from the later writing of Ginsberg, Burroughs and Kerouac that none were unaware of the complexities of the situation.Another point of view regarding the relationship between Carr and Kammerer is offered by the author, Caleb Carr (Lucien's Carr's son), in a recent posting on the internet. After reading the lengthy piece, I couldn't find a great deal with it that differed from the movie except for one thing. Caleb Carr seemed very determined to prove that his father was NOT gay. He had no trouble referring to his father as a ""monster"", ""abuser"" and good at using homosexuals for his own benefit. He accused his father of abusing him when he was a youngster; but he wanted to assure the reader that his father was not a homosexual. I couldn't help but think that I would personally prefer a father who was a closet homosexual to one who was a monster, abuser and clever manipulator of the gay people in his life. Caleb Carr seems also to be convinced that this film is part of a Hollywood homosexual agenda to prove that all men are gay. I'm not sure I understand that viewpoint. Nothing about the film suggests that viewpoint at all.I highly recommend this film.",5,One of the Best Films of 2013 ...

Schultz,"[1, 1]","This is like a less fictional version of the 1980&#8217;s Masterpiece Theater Classic series &#8220;Brideshead Revisited.&#8221; As in that series, we have a young innocent coming onto campus and soon being captivated by a handsome, epicene upper classman. In this case, the young innocent is the real-life poet-to-be Allen Ginsberg, and the upperclassman is Lucien Carr. Like Brideshead&#8217;s Sebastian before him, Lucien Carr is shown here inciting those in his circle to exotic sensualities and sexual experimentation. Like a King Cobra, his gaze has hypnotized others before Ginsberg. But when he is through with them, they are not always ready to be through with him. That&#8217;s where the tragedy of this association of Burroughs/Kerouac/Ginsberg/Carr germinates.Some of the descendents of these founders of the Beat Generation have challenged the truthfulness of this film&#8217;s depiction. I had other problems with the movie, besides the dubious nature of some of its biography. The other problem with this film for me was that it was too fragmented and episodic. I never felt I got a chance to know or care about any of these proto-Beats. I found I was finishing watching the movie as I myself might finish a school assignment, coerced by Lucien&#8217;s magnetism into doing his homework for him. It was a bit of a chore, but I watched the film to the end in order to acquaint myself with some of the early history of this influential clique of poets, rebels, and easy riders.Flawed as it might be, this film provides a valuable clue to the lives of these creative individuals &#8211; a clue that most modern readers of their work probably never suspected existed.",4,Brideshead Re-Revisited,1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,1678,"['less', 'fictional', 'version', '1980', '8217', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'Classic', 'series', '8220', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited.', '8221', 'series', 'have', 'young', 'innocent', 'coming', 'campus', 'soon', 'being', 'captivated', 'handsome', 'epicene', 'upper', 'classman', 'case', 'young', 'innocent', 'real-life', 'poet-to-be', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'upperclassman', 'Lucien', 'Carr', 'Brideshead', '8217', 'Sebastian', 'Lucien', 'Carr', 'shown', 'here', 'inciting', 'circle', 'exotic', 'sensualities', 'sexual', 'experimentation', 'King', 'Cobra', 'gaze', 'hypnotized', 'others', 'Ginsberg', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'ready', 'be', '8217', 'where', 'tragedy', 'association', 'Burroughs/Kerouac/Ginsberg/Carr', 'germinates.Some', 'descendents', 'founders', 'Beat', 'Generation', 'have', 'challenged', 'truthfulness', 'film', '8217', 's', 'depiction', 'had', 'other', 'problems', 'movie', 'dubious', 'nature', 'biography', 'other', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'too', 'fragmented', 'episodic', 'never', 'felt', 'got', 'chance', 'know', 'care', 'proto-Beats', 'found', 'was', 'finishing', 'watching', 'movie', 'might', 'finish', 'school', 'assignment', 'coerced', 'Lucien', '8217', 's', 'magnetism', 'doing', 'homework', 'was', 'bit', 'chore', 'watched', 'film', 'end', 'order', 'acquaint', 'early', 'history', 'influential', 'clique', 'poets', 'rebels', 'easy', 'riders.Flawed', 'might', 'be', 'film', 'valuable', 'clue', 'lives', 'creative', 'individuals', '8211', 'clue', 'most', 'modern', 'readers', 'work', 'probably', 'never', 'suspected', 'existed']",N/A

The film concentrates on the complex relationship of Ginsberg and Carr, from their writing, to sharing of private lives, to their &#34;New Vision&#34; their &#34;rearrangement of the senses&#34; to their lover relationship.Other characters include Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) and William Burroughs (Ben Foster).

Somethings are not for everyone, but I can still appreciate the terrific performances and unique storyline of Kill Your Darlings. This film follows the early lives, and some previously untold stories, of the 1940's Beat Generation. People like Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, & William S. Burroughs are featured prominently in this film, and show what some of America's greatest writers were like when they were mere college students. The story centers mainly around Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan),  who was better than any of them, and could have also been one of the greats, if it wasn't for an event that changed his life forever. The story is a gripping drama, telling a true, untold story from the 1940's, so what's not to like? There was a lot of focus on Philosophy, Art, Poetry and Love. There are some people that really that stuff up, but it just really wasn't for me. DeHaan and Daniel Radcliffe were both terrific, but I'll always have a problem seeing Radcliffe playing anyone except for Harry Potter, and when Radcliffe was in a rather graphic sex scene, I admit I had to avert my eyes. The bottom line is that Kill Your Darlings isn't a bad film, but it's very philosophic and somewhat slow moving.

What starts off as a group trying to change the world spirals out of control until a murder changes the lives of all of them. I have never been &#34;hip&#34; or into the beat poet scene. Never been a fan of Kerouac or even a big fan of Hunter S. Thompson for that matter. Not really sure why but they just never appealed to me. I watched On The Road but wasn't that impressed so I wasn't all that excited about watching this one. I do have to admit that this was much better then I expected. This one had a Dead Poet's Society aspect to it and I think that is why I ended up liking it. If you are a fan of the beat poet generation then you will love this.
