My response was that it is ""dumbstick."" To me, that one word sums up the zany antics of Benny Hill. Hill is English, so some of his routines are more targeted to a British audience, yet Americans will also find it funny.The scenes are a combination of wry looks at the camera and blatantly stupid actions combined with a lot of head-patting. One of the characters is an elderly man with a bald head and it gets ""tender-patted"" a lot. There is also a great deal of silly and mild sexual innuendo, Hill was the master of the stupid sexual situation.Hill was also ""original"" enough to sometimes have his comic bits filmed without sound and sometimes even in black and white. His usage of what most would consider an archaic tactic forces his players to perform to a higher level. The exaggerated body motions in the skit involving doctors and a hospital was the primary factor that made it hilarious.If you are not familiar with the comedy of Benny Hill, you should examine this tape. While his humor is not for everyone, if you like a combination of dumb jokes and slapstick, then he will make you laugh.",5,"Hill's ""dumbstick"" style of comedy is underappreciated",1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,1224,"['When', 'was', 'putting', 'tape', 'VCR', 'wife', 'unfamiliar', 'comedy', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'asked', 'was', 'slapstick', 'response', 'was', 'dumbstick', 'one', 'word', 'up', 'zany', 'antics', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'Hill', 'English', 'so', 'routines', 'are', 'more', 'targeted', 'British', 'audience', 'Americans', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'funny.The', 'scenes', 'are', 'combination', 'wry', 'looks', 'camera', 'blatantly', 'stupid', 'actions', 'combined', 'lot', 'head-patting', 'One', 'characters', 'elderly', 'man', 'bald', 'head', 'tender-patted', 'lot', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'silly', 'mild', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'Hill', 'was', 'master', 'stupid', 'sexual', 'situation.Hill', 'was', 'also', 'original', 'enough', 'sometimes', 'have', 'comic', 'bits', 'filmed', 'sound', 'sometimes', 'even', 'black', 'white', 'usage', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'consider', 'archaic', 'tactic', 'forces', 'players', 'perform', 'higher', 'level', 'exaggerated', 'body', 'motions', 'skit', 'involving', 'doctors', 'hospital', 'was', 'primary', 'factor', 'made', 'hilarious.If', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'comedy', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'should', 'examine', 'tape', 'humor', 'not', 'everyone', 'like', 'combination', 'dumb', 'jokes', 'slapstick', 'then', 'will', 'make', 'laugh']",N/A

Seasoned fans may be a little disappointed in what, at first blush, appears to be a limited amount of sketches and skits, but for the neophyte this is quite decent.  And really, for the price it is more than adequate to get you fix of Benny Hill.For those trying Hill for the first time, you may have heard about varying degrees of sexism in Hill that may make his comedy at best dated and at worse offensive and less than politically correct.  I find this sentiment to be unfortunate; Hill did make comedy that held to the values of his day, but that does not mean at all that it does not hold up.  Not long ago, in 2006 maybe, the BBC did a special on asking whether or not Hill was still funny to a contemporary young audience who, in all probability had never seen The Benny Hill Show.  As I understand, young people of varying ilks found it funny and not offensive.  While I support political correctness in its most practical manifestations, rendering taboo a sketch comedy show for theoretically problematic material is foolish and points to an unfortunate sway of reason from common sense to a kind of cultural nihilism and serious spirit that threatens to turn us into a culture of dour, angry and resentful people.So there is my rant and recommendation; if you haven't seen The Benny Hill Show this is a good place to start.

Benny also plays Fred Scuttle, of course, and this time he's in charge of the fire brigade. with sight gags galore and low-brow british humor, Benny Hill ironically became a favorite among children in his later years {his silent, fast-paced sketches with only the trademark saxophone wailing away became kid favorites believe it or not}. Jack Wright, the bald guy always being slapped on the head, is in this tape during numerous sketches. Henry McGee, in a sketch, plays a talk show host interviewing a French movie director {played by Benny}. the video is 83 minutes long, jam-packed with Benny Hill comedy. no Hill video would be complete without the Hill's Angels. while not as prominent in this as they are in the other tapes, the angels mostly appear in the fast-paced sketches as objects of Benny's obsession. another nutty fast-paced sketch involves Benny as a butler...Jack Wright as a groom and a Hill's Angel as the bride. whenever Wright's back is turned, Benny and the bride fall behind pieces of furniture and make out. Wright catches the two and the butler's kicked out...only to return as someone else the following week.

Some of the sketches run on a bit longer than necessary, others are short and sweet. Movie buffs will love two sketches in particular: 1) Benny is the star of a 1930s late-show movie, but the print is terrible (Benny and the cast ingeniously simulate splicy dialogue, projection at the wrong speed, etc.); 2) A cineaste -- Hill's straight man Henry McGee in a delightfully over-the-top performance -- interviews famed French director Benny, asking searching questions and getting matter-of-fact answers. Benny's monologues are fun, too -- his story of a little boy who befriends a bird is timed beautifully.
