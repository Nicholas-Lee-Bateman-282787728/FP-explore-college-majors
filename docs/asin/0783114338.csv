Someone gave us the video as a gift and wanted me to look it over. so here goes . . .NEGATIVE:  The language seems to be an attempt to make a statement, but the statement is so overdone the message gets lost.  It seems to attempt to be radical, but I've seen some real life stories that were much more radical.  The message tries to offer a new twist on the classic struggle between good and evil, but I didn't care enough for the main character to get it.  The overall atmosphere of the pice seems to make a statement that might be offensive to some.  I am sure that many would expect me to be offended by it.  I wasn't offended, I was bored.  Actually, my first time through, I fell asleep and had to see it again to get it.  My two sons, (age 17 &amp; 21) also watched it with me and they also fell asleep.POSITIVE:  The artistry is excellent.  For fans of the series, I am sure it is a great piece.  As with many videos (such as Dragon Ball Z) a lot of your enjoyment comes from your previous contact with the series.  It does a fairly good job of speaking for those 16-25 year olds who are facing a world of darkness, emotional energy, unwavering established values among the establishment, confusing morality, and rebellion.  Younger people might not understand it and older people might not find it interesting.RECOMMENDATION: It did nothing for me, but if you are already a fan of the series it will probably interest you.  I suspect that almost everyone reading this review will be a fan of the series (why else read this).  Therefore, my review will be the minority.  Enjoy it, but don't take it too seriously.",2,I Fell Asleep,1072396800,"12 26, 2003",2003,1755,"['look', 'up', 'record', 'will', 'find', 'usually', 'review', 'religious', 'works', 'admittedly', 'am', 'not', 'best', 'person', 'review', 'SPAWN', 'Someone', 'gave', 'video', 'gift', 'wanted', 'look', 'over', 'so', 'here', '.NEGATIVE', 'language', 'be', 'attempt', 'make', 'statement', 'statement', 'so', 'overdone', 'message', 'lost', 'attempt', 'be', 'radical', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'real', 'life', 'stories', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'radical', 'message', 'offer', 'new', 'twist', 'classic', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'main', 'character', 'get', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'pice', 'make', 'statement', 'might', 'be', 'offensive', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'offended', 'was', ""n't"", 'offended', 'was', 'bored', 'Actually', 'first', 'time', 'fell', 'asleep', 'had', 'see', 'again', 'get', 'two', 'sons', 'age', '17', 'amp', '21', 'also', 'watched', 'also', 'fell', 'asleep.POSITIVE', 'artistry', 'excellent', 'fans', 'series', 'am', 'sure', 'great', 'piece', 'many', 'videos', 'such', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'lot', 'enjoyment', 'previous', 'contact', 'series', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'speaking', '16-25', 'year', 'olds', 'who', 'are', 'facing', 'world', 'darkness', 'emotional', 'energy', 'unwavering', 'established', 'values', 'establishment', 'confusing', 'morality', 'rebellion', 'Younger', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'understand', 'older', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'find', 'interesting.RECOMMENDATION', 'did', 'nothing', 'are', 'already', 'fan', 'series', 'will', 'probably', 'interest', 'suspect', 'almost', 'everyone', 'reading', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'fan', 'series', 'why', 'else', 'read', 'Therefore', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'minority', 'Enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously']",N/A

I did not have high hope for the animated series but I was very much surprised. The dialogue and, bizzarly enough, the acting are a hundred times as good as the film and the plot and characters are also much more intriguing.This is the second season of Spawn and it is crammed full of plot developments and great characters. Sam and Twitch get more room here. But since this has stopped airing as of 1999 there has been no fourth season. It's a shame since the one thing I can be sure ofis that the story could have had one hell of a send-off when it finally climaxes.It's more than likely in syndication somewhere so I'd start watching this if I were you. But be prepared. The violence is quite graphic and the overall tone of the stories ranges from kiddie fiddlers to satanic demons. Needless to say, it's not a cartoon for kids. It's an animated series for adults.The DVD is in full screen format, as originally drawn and is in Dolby 5.1 surround.

The flow of it is substandard, and reeks of slow-downs and mid-class transitions.Also, even though the voices are right on the money, the text seems a bit...off.Considering the first and third animated Spawn movies, and the extent of swearing, cursing, and exclamations used frequently, this PG-13 style of voice-text seems a bit out of place.I realize that the comic book the movies are based on are kept to a PG-13 level as well, but when you talk about the movies and their own dialouge, you'll come to see the comic book and the films are quite different.But, as I said before, if you're a Spawn fan, you shouldn't hesitate too much to buy this tape and the others as well.",3,"It's Spawn, But Not At His Best",1082160000,"04 17, 2004",2004,1176,"['Point', 'given', 'Spawn', 'fan', 'will', 'enjoy', 'video', 'least', 'bit', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'obvious', 'reason', 'not', 'to.The', 'animation', 'dark', 'full', 'shadows', 'voice-actuing', 'very', 'accurate', 'storyline', 'true.So', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'higher', 'rating', 'Well', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'one', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'familiar', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'animation', 'holding', 'true', 'dark', 'Gothic', 'style', 'second-rate', 'flow', 'substandard', 'reeks', 'slow-downs', 'mid-class', 'transitions.Also', 'even', 'voices', 'are', 'right', 'money', 'text', 'bit', 'off.Considering', 'first', 'third', 'animated', 'Spawn', 'movies', 'extent', 'swearing', 'cursing', 'exclamations', 'used', 'frequently', 'PG-13', 'style', 'voice-text', 'bit', 'place.I', 'realize', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'are', 'based', 'are', 'kept', 'PG-13', 'level', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'talk', 'movies', 'own', 'dialouge', ""'ll"", 'come', 'see', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'different.But', 'said', ""'re"", 'Spawn', 'fan', 'should', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'too', 'much', 'buy', 'tape', 'others', 'well']",N/A
