329216,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302719062,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","Joe, 1970 filmIt starts in a big city with a tall office building. A young woman walks to the IRT subway and returns home. Her boyfriend is in the bathtub, she joins him. He talks about a big deal, but he's $50 short. He tastes a powder then cooks it for an injection (""mainlining""). Their talk tells of their sordid life. There is music from a radio station. ""I'll be right back."" She goes to a store and creates a disturbance. She is taken to a hospital for treatment. Her parents arrive to help her out. Later they go to her room. Downstairs two young women pay $10 for illegal drugs. The parents meet her boyfriend. Does he match the description? [Some language can't be broadcast.] There is violence! ""Oh, no!"" The father leaves and stops in at a local bar. A customer in this bar complains about society (as he sees it). [Have you heard this before?] Joe continues to spout his beliefs about the rich and the poor.Do the rich set a bad example for the rest of society? [Or are they just people with money?] Joe would like to kill one of those hippies. ""A great kidder!"" William Compton gets a telephone call about his daughter, then leaves. The next day Joe returns from work for a meal of chuck steak, lumpy mashed potatoes, and fudge cake. His wife talks about a soap opera on TV. [TV provides a distraction from the real world.] There are new neighbors. Joe has rifles in his basement. They watch the news. Frank Russo was killed in his apartment; drugs were involved. Joe calls Compton at his office. ""How did you get my number?"" They meet at a bowling alley. Joe figured out who killed that hippy drug dealer. Joe earned $4 an hour. [Minimum wage was s$1.50; the monetary figures date this film.] William earns $60G a year. Joe talks about his life. William takes Joe to his uptown bar. William plays a joke on Gil about a change at work.What is one of nature's simple enjoyments? What do they do in those offices? They move paper. Joe invites Compton to his home. `See how the other half lives."" We see Joe's living room. [Note the manners of the Compton's as they arrive.] ""Nice place you've got here."" Joe wipes his hands on his pants. [Scripted.] They ordered take out, the best Chinese food in Astoria. Melissa leaves her hospital room. What was happening to kids today? [Television? Culture? Or corporate control of advertising that influences the thinking of most people?] Joe show off his Tommy gun. [Believable?] Joe has a ""well balanced gun collection"" of WW II rifles. [No Mannlicher-Carcano?] ""It has a lot of stopping power."" The Compton's return to their apartment overlooking Central Park and talk freely. Can you live with anything? Melissa hears their talk! She runs away. William and Joe visit a Village bar. ""No alcohol served here."" [Did they lose their license?]They continue to search for Melissa. [This is supposed to be funny.] Joe and William visit a hippy pad. Joe smokes a water pipe. Will they tune in, turn on, and drop out? [The figures are blurred for broadcast TV.] ""I hope I'm not out of line."" ""Take off your clothes."" ""Socks too."" [Is this a form of soft porn?] Later our ""heroes"" recover. ""I don't need no preliminaries."" A one-night stand? Their clothes are searched for credit cards. One girl tells where the others went ""in the country"". They drive there in a 1962 Chevrolet Impala. Joe brought his hardware along. ""Where's the money?"" Shots are fired. Will they clean up this mess? Yes. Compton shoots the visitors for an ironic and symbolic ending.This 1970 movie is rarely shown on broadcast TV unless edited. This movie documents the attitudes and culture of some in the late 1960s to early 1970s, as seen by Hollywood. This movie was not a big hit. Does it match your memory of those times?

HiFi sound is also clear. Downside: persistent scratch lines on the right half of the picture for about 20 minutes.Haven't seen JOE since 1970 but I remember it well and also once had the MERCURY Records soundtrack LP,JOE SPEAKS. This review's title is from an infamous barroom soliloquy heard on that album.Peter Boyle as Joe is decidely not the jolly monster of YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN  (VHS)  (DVD), and he's far more acidic than Ray Romano's dad on TV'sEVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND.Joe Curran is a blue collared New Yorker who's angry over the state of the world. When he gets a few beers under his belt Joe spouts hatred of blacks, hippies, social workers and even his own progeny (""I got a kid... ahhh, screw 'im!""). As Joe blows off steam in his favorite neighbohood tavern, Bill Compton (Dennis Patrick), a man who is his opposite in every possible way, wanders in.Compton, a well-to-do businessman, has just done the unthinkable: he's murdered his daughter's junkie boyfriend after the guy caused Melissa (Susan Sarandon, in her first movie) to O.D.Bill throws down a few stiff drinks and listens to Joe's ranting diatribe. When Joe says that he'd like to kill a hippie Bill slurs out, ""I just did."" Thus, an unlikely friendship is forged, based on Joe's desire to ""off"" a creep and Bill's having done so.This strange duo explore the counter-culture while searching for Melissa, who disappeared after learning what her father did. They visit a macrobiotic restaurant, party with some kids and participate in an orgy. Ultimately, the story ends in an unforeseen tragedy for one of them.John Avildsen's movie illustrates the dark, violent side of the Generation Gap. With an ongoing war in Southeast Asia and student protests that just a month before ""Joe"" was released culminated in the Kent State massacre, this film's shocking conclusion seems almost predestined.Highest recommendation!JOE is also available onDVD.",5,"""There oughta be a law: you don't work, you don't drink!""",1267315200,"02 28, 2010",2010,2054,"['Even', 'FRONT', 'ROW', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'VHS', 'movie', 'recorded', 'slowest', 'tape', 'speed', 'tracking', 'stable', 'image', 'very', 'sharp', 'HiFi', 'sound', 'also', 'clear', 'Downside', 'persistent', 'scratch', 'lines', 'right', 'half', 'picture', 'about', '20', 'minutes.Have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'JOE', '1970', 'remember', 'well', 'also', 'once', 'had', 'MERCURY', 'Records', 'soundtrack', 'LP', 'JOE', 'SPEAKS', 'review', 'title', 'infamous', 'barroom', 'soliloquy', 'heard', 'album.Peter', 'Boyle', 'Joe', 'decidely', 'not', 'jolly', 'monster', 'YOUNG', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'far', 'more', 'acidic', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'dad', ""TV'sEVERYBODY"", 'LOVES', 'RAYMOND.Joe', 'Curran', 'blue', 'collared', 'New', 'Yorker', 'who', 'angry', 'state', 'world', 'When', 'few', 'beers', 'belt', 'Joe', 'hatred', 'blacks', 'hippies', 'social', 'workers', 'even', 'own', 'progeny', 'got', 'kid', 'ahhh', 'screw', 'Joe', 'off', 'steam', 'favorite', 'neighbohood', 'tavern', 'Bill', 'Compton', 'Dennis', 'Patrick', 'man', 'who', 'opposite', 'possible', 'way', 'wanders', 'in.Compton', 'well-to-do', 'businessman', 'just', 'done', 'unthinkable', 'murdered', 'daughter', 'junkie', 'boyfriend', 'guy', 'caused', 'Melissa', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'first', 'movie', 'O.D.Bill', 'down', 'few', 'stiff', 'drinks', 'listens', 'Joe', 'ranting', 'diatribe', 'When', 'Joe', ""'d"", 'like', 'kill', 'hippie', 'Bill', 'out', 'just', 'did', 'Thus', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'forged', 'based', 'Joe', 'desire', 'off', 'creep', 'Bill', 'having', 'done', 'so.This', 'strange', 'duo', 'counter-culture', 'searching', 'Melissa', 'who', 'disappeared', 'learning', 'what', 'father', 'did', 'visit', 'macrobiotic', 'restaurant', 'party', 'kids', 'participate', 'orgy', 'Ultimately', 'story', 'unforeseen', 'tragedy', 'one', 'them.John', 'Avildsen', 'movie', 'dark', 'violent', 'side', 'Generation', 'Gap', 'ongoing', 'war', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'student', 'protests', 'just', 'month', 'Joe', 'was', 'released', 'culminated', 'Kent', 'State', 'massacre', 'film', 'shocking', 'conclusion', 'almost', 'predestined.Highest', 'recommendation', 'JOE', 'also', 'available', 'onDVD']",N/A
329218,A1EHD9FFW3274W,6302719062,copy_1@hotmail.com,"[6, 8]","22. JOE (drama, 1970) Joe (Peter Boyle) is a factory worker who's known to hate &quot;hippies and niggers&quot;. He's a loudmouth who despises them saying that if he had the chance he'd go on a killing spree. He meets Bill,  a businessman who has just murdered the lover of his drug addict young  daughter Jill (Susan Sarandon). Finding out Jill runs away and joins a  hippie commune at the outskirts of town. Bill turns to Joe for help. Their  search leads them through the seediest parts of town where both men's inner  hatred and loath is furthered tested. They finally discover Jill and the  climax that ensues turns bloody.Critique: This was director John G.  Avildsen's first sleeper-turned smash hit (an amazing run of others  include: Rocky, The Karate Kid, Split-Image, Weekend at Bernie's). Film is  interesting enough in that it served to encapsulate the themes and ideas of  the turbulent 60s (Vietnam War, black power, women's lib etc.). It also has  a good performance from Peter Boyle as Joe, one of the cinema's first  antiheroes. He's always been good at playing creepy, bossy heavies whose  abstract ideas are enforced by his intimidating presence (he would play the  Frankenstein monster in Mel Brook's spoof Young Frankenstein). He reminds  me of a little kid trapped in a big, dumb, awkward body. Film has a weak  script (the meeting of Joe and Bill, for instance, is a bit coincidental),  but it has a particularly gruesome, post-Taxi Driver ending.QUOTE: Title  Song: &quot;I saw a fella selling junk to children  He gets nervous everytime I pass  Cause he knows that if I catch him  I'm gonna kick his head and kick his fat ***.&quot;",4,CULT MOVIES 22,917913600,"02 2, 1999",1999,1658,"['22', 'JOE', 'drama', '1970', 'Joe', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'factory', 'worker', 'who', 'known', 'hate', 'quot', 'hippies', 'niggers', 'quot', 'loudmouth', 'who', 'saying', 'had', 'chance', ""'d"", 'go', 'killing', 'spree', 'Bill', 'businessman', 'who', 'just', 'murdered', 'lover', 'drug', 'addict', 'young', 'daughter', 'Jill', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Finding', 'out', 'Jill', 'away', 'hippie', 'commune', 'outskirts', 'town', 'Bill', 'Joe', 'help', 'search', 'seediest', 'parts', 'town', 'where', 'men', 'inner', 'hatred', 'loath', 'furthered', 'tested', 'finally', 'discover', 'Jill', 'climax', 'bloody.Critique', 'was', 'director', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'first', 'sleeper-turned', 'smash', 'hit', 'amazing', 'run', 'others', 'include', 'Rocky', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Split-Image', 'Weekend', 'Bernie', 'Film', 'interesting', 'enough', 'served', 'encapsulate', 'themes', 'ideas', 'turbulent', '60s', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'black', 'power', 'women', 'lib', 'etc.', 'also', 'good', 'performance', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'Joe', 'one', 'cinema', 'first', 'antiheroes', 'always', 'been', 'good', 'playing', 'creepy', 'bossy', 'heavies', 'abstract', 'ideas', 'are', 'enforced', 'intimidating', 'presence', 'would', 'play', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'Mel', 'Brook', 'spoof', 'Young', 'Frankenstein', 'little', 'kid', 'trapped', 'big', 'dumb', 'awkward', 'body', 'Film', 'weak', 'script', 'meeting', 'Joe', 'Bill', 'instance', 'bit', 'coincidental', 'particularly', 'gruesome', 'post-Taxi', 'Driver', 'ending.QUOTE', 'Title', 'Song', 'quot', 'saw', 'fella', 'selling', 'junk', 'children', 'nervous', 'everytime', 'pass', 'catch', ""'m"", 'gon', 'kick', 'head', 'kick', 'fat', '***.', 'quot']",N/A

329220,A3UYERNM2UQ30B,6302719062,"directions ""neuralbuddhist""","[4, 18]","I would like to preface this review by saying I do not think that the issues that the movie deals with that culminated in the Kent State tragedy are what I am finding humorous. Also some of the actors/actresses in the movie have played better roles (e.g. Peter Boyle's ""Wizard"" character in Taxi Driver, though a minor role is more believable than the ""Joe"" character). I don't know what side the movie is on, all of the characters are stereotypes, generated by either the left or right wing. I guess the ""Joe"" character did inspire Archie Bunker but who cares? Joe is just as stereotypical as Archie Bunker but more pathetic and totally unsympathetic. However, on the other side the hippies appear to exist only to get high and get laid. This is exactly what middle America thought of the counterculture. Though some of the scenes are disturbing there are some that are unintentionally hilarious. The scene where the Dennis Patrick character and his wife are having Chinese food with ""Joe"" and his wife could have some comedic value if it were not so heavy handed. When he and Joe try to track down his daughter, they decide ""when in Rome, do as the Romans do"" participate in a hippie orgy and can't get into the sex and are unable to get high from the pot. The ending, though serious (I won't reveal it) comes out of nowhere and is totally unbelievable. If the director John Avildson had just played this movie for laughs as an exploitation flick, then it might have worked but I guess with Altamount and Charles Manson and all that on people's minds they weren't ready to mine humor out of the cultural wars yet.

329221,A1LACH6MLQWZ,6302719062,Doug Erlandson,"[3, 3]","Having been a young adult (mid-twenties) in 1970, the year ""Joe"" was released, I would have to say that this movie is a fairly realistic portrayal of the culture clashes of the era. Peter Boyle, who plays Joe, a blue-color factory worker, and Dennis Patrick, who plays an upper middle class businessman, do an excellent job of portraying two different types of conservatives of the era. Joe, a veteran, is simply incapable of understanding the counterculture and its opposition to the Vietnam War. His frustration expresses itself in an irrational anger that at the proper moment is capable of expressing itself in violence against those he perceives as the enemy. Dennis Patrick's character Bill Compton doesn't have any more use for hippies and others in the counterculture, but on the surface he seems far more in control of his emotions.When Bill's daughter, Melissa (Susan Sarandon in her first movie), who is living with her drug-pushing boyfriend, has a bad trip and goes into drug treatment, Bill confronts her boyfriend Frank. When he is taunted by Frank, he snaps and inadvertently kills him. Stopping at a bar to settle his nerves with a couple shots of whiskey, Bill runs into Joe, who is drunk and loudly carrying on about hippies. When Jope says, ""I'd like to kill a hippie,"" Bill replies, ""I just did."" He then tries to make what he said sound as though he is joking, but a few days later, when the news breaks that a hippie drug dealer has been found dead in his apartment, Joe puts two and two together and realizes that Bill wasn't kidding. He contacts Bill, not to blackmail him, but because he regards Bill as a hero.This leads to a friendship of sorts between the two. When Bill's daughter, having been released from the hospital after her drug overdose, discovers that her father has killed her boyfriend, she leaves home and disappears into the hippie community. Hoping to find her, Bill and Joe head into the community. The results are predictably disastrous.All in all this is an extremely well-acted movie. The only exception is Frank, who appears as more a caricature of a would-be big-time drug dealer than anything else.Also, while much of the movie is compelling, a few scenes are overdone. The attempt to show the contrast between Joe and his wife and Bill and his is awkwardly overdrawn.Otherwise, this is a good movie, one that paints a surprisingly realistic picture of the way things were in this country four decades ago.",4,Realistic portrayal,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,2457,"['Having', 'been', 'young', 'adult', 'mid-twenties', '1970', 'year', 'Joe', 'was', 'released', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'culture', 'clashes', 'era', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'who', 'Joe', 'blue-color', 'factory', 'worker', 'Dennis', 'Patrick', 'who', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'businessman', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'two', 'different', 'types', 'conservatives', 'era', 'Joe', 'veteran', 'simply', 'incapable', 'understanding', 'counterculture', 'opposition', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'frustration', 'irrational', 'anger', 'proper', 'moment', 'capable', 'expressing', 'violence', 'enemy', 'Dennis', 'Patrick', 'character', 'Bill', 'Compton', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'use', 'hippies', 'others', 'counterculture', 'surface', 'far', 'more', 'control', 'emotions.When', 'Bill', 'daughter', 'Melissa', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'first', 'movie', 'who', 'living', 'drug-pushing', 'boyfriend', 'bad', 'trip', 'drug', 'treatment', 'Bill', 'boyfriend', 'Frank', 'When', 'taunted', 'Frank', 'inadvertently', 'Stopping', 'bar', 'settle', 'nerves', 'couple', 'shots', 'whiskey', 'Bill', 'Joe', 'who', 'drunk', 'loudly', 'carrying', 'hippies', 'When', 'Jope', ""'d"", 'like', 'kill', 'hippie', 'Bill', 'just', 'did', 'then', 'make', 'what', 'said', 'sound', 'joking', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'when', 'news', 'breaks', 'hippie', 'drug', 'dealer', 'been', 'found', 'dead', 'apartment', 'Joe', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'realizes', 'Bill', 'was', ""n't"", 'kidding', 'Bill', 'not', 'blackmail', 'Bill', 'hero.This', 'friendship', 'sorts', 'two', 'When', 'Bill', 'daughter', 'having', 'been', 'released', 'hospital', 'drug', 'overdose', 'discovers', 'father', 'killed', 'boyfriend', 'home', 'hippie', 'community', 'Hoping', 'find', 'Bill', 'Joe', 'head', 'community', 'results', 'are', 'predictably', 'disastrous.All', 'extremely', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'only', 'exception', 'Frank', 'who', 'more', 'caricature', 'would-be', 'big-time', 'drug', 'dealer', 'anything', 'else.Also', 'much', 'movie', 'compelling', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'overdone', 'attempt', 'show', 'contrast', 'Joe', 'wife', 'Bill', 'awkwardly', 'overdrawn.Otherwise', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'surprisingly', 'realistic', 'picture', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'country', 'four', 'decades', 'ago']",N/A

We also get the debut of Susan Sarandon, who star really wouldn't shine until, well, how about ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show""?  She certainly shone for me there!  However, she was a small if important figure in this movie, and it's Boyle who carries it.What's strange about the film is that the ""star"" and title character does not get introduced until over thirty minutes into the film, before he virtually takes it over.  We are first introduced to Sarandon and her hippy-dippy drug dealing boy friend.  They are leading relatively aimless lives, and the boyfriend is as scummy as a drug dealer gets, in that he rips off his customers.  When Sarandon overdoses, we are introduced to her parents, we see the first of two foil situations in this movie.There are two tugs-of-war going on in this movie.  There is the generation gap here, as the hippy kids can't figure out why the parents would want to work the way they do to get the life they lead.  Yes, the parents are stereotypes of people who's joy in life consists of their evening cocktail, but the alternative presented by the kids here is not that appealing either.Then there is the tug-of-war between white collar and blue collar.  Sarandon's parents are relatively wealthy, and after the father has his ""conflict"" with the boyfriend, he drowns his sorrows in a bar.  Enter Boyle, who has been raving about everything wrong with current society in a manner that must have inspired Archie Bunker.  When white-collar tells Joe the blue-collar that he wailed on a hippie, he becomes Joe's hero.A little too much though, as Joe starts involving himself in a life he can only imagine.  We see scenes between the two, and then with their wives involved, that show much uncomfortable ness as they realize (well, all but Joe seem to realize) that they live in different worlds.  But they also find that their bond (hating hippies) is strong enough that they even begin to admire each other.The film takes no real sides in all four areas.  All have their points, and all have their faults.  The youth understandably don't want to turn into their parents, but don't seem to offer a decent alternative.  The older people are too set in their ways, but they earned their livelihoods, and this is how they choose their later years.  The white-collars are a bit spoiled, but they seem to have education on their side.  The blue-collars have a lot of prejudices based on ignorance, but in a way are the salt of the earth.  The strength of this picture is that this is all presented while telling an unusual male-bonding story.",4,"Dated, but still engaging",1048636800,"03 26, 2003",2003,2696,"['movie', 'introduced', 'world', 'two', 'new', 'stars', 'One', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'became', 'star', 'instantly', 'still', 'one', 'today', 'also', 'get', 'debut', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'star', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'shine', 'well', 'how', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'certainly', 'shone', 'However', 'was', 'small', 'important', 'figure', 'movie', 'Boyle', 'who', 'it.What', 'strange', 'film', 'star', 'title', 'character', 'not', 'get', 'introduced', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'virtually', 'over', 'are', 'first', 'introduced', 'Sarandon', 'hippy-dippy', 'drug', 'dealing', 'boy', 'friend', 'are', 'leading', 'relatively', 'aimless', 'lives', 'boyfriend', 'as', 'scummy', 'drug', 'dealer', 'customers', 'When', 'Sarandon', 'are', 'introduced', 'parents', 'see', 'first', 'two', 'foil', 'situations', 'are', 'two', 'tugs-of-war', 'going', 'movie', 'generation', 'gap', 'here', 'hippy', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'parents', 'would', 'want', 'work', 'way', 'do', 'get', 'life', 'lead', 'Yes', 'parents', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'people', 'who', 'joy', 'life', 'consists', 'evening', 'cocktail', 'alternative', 'presented', 'kids', 'here', 'not', 'appealing', 'either.Then', 'tug-of-war', 'white', 'collar', 'blue', 'collar', 'Sarandon', 'parents', 'are', 'relatively', 'wealthy', 'father', 'conflict', 'boyfriend', 'sorrows', 'bar', 'Enter', 'Boyle', 'who', 'been', 'raving', 'everything', 'wrong', 'current', 'society', 'manner', 'must', 'have', 'inspired', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'When', 'white-collar', 'tells', 'blue-collar', 'wailed', 'hippie', 'Joe', 'hero.A', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'though', 'Joe', 'involving', 'life', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'see', 'scenes', 'two', 'then', 'wives', 'involved', 'show', 'much', 'uncomfortable', 'ness', 'realize', 'well', 'Joe', 'seem', 'realize', 'live', 'different', 'worlds', 'also', 'find', 'bond', 'hating', 'hippies', 'strong', 'enough', 'even', 'begin', 'admire', 'other.The', 'film', 'real', 'sides', 'four', 'areas', 'have', 'points', 'have', 'faults', 'youth', 'understandably', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'turn', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'offer', 'decent', 'alternative', 'older', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'set', 'ways', 'earned', 'livelihoods', 'how', 'choose', 'later', 'years', 'white-collars', 'are', 'bit', 'spoiled', 'seem', 'have', 'education', 'side', 'blue-collars', 'have', 'lot', 'prejudices', 'based', 'ignorance', 'way', 'are', 'salt', 'earth', 'strength', 'picture', 'presented', 'telling', 'unusual', 'male-bonding', 'story']",N/A

But does anybody give a good goddamn?...&quot;  -Title Song from  &quot;Joe&quot;Peter Boyle's debut as the bigoted hard-hat Joe Curran  should send a message that is as pivotal now as it was back in 1970- racism  and hatred of counterculture are simply signs of confusion of the times we  live in. His emotional depth that he puts in his role was more than  Oscar-worthy, simply because he was a man of limited emotion and limited  feeling. Joe Curran, one of cinema's first anti-heroes, is a lovable and  favored character trapped in the walls of his frustrations. He was a man  who needed an escape from his blue-collar existence. This is why we  empathize with his flag-waving, freedom-loving persona.&quot;Joe,&quot; adapted from Norman's Wexler's worthy script, was a  sleeper hit back in its initial release and a personal triumph to all  involved (specifically director, John G. Avildsen, and actress, Susan  Sarandon) and rocketed them all to stardom. To put it simple, the film is a  swan song in waiting about the complex blue collar view of the hippie  generation of the 1960's, actually being a film suitable for any  counterculture generation. It shows how often confused past generations are  with new lifestyles and fads, etc. This is an excellent film that is worthy  of being a favorite of mine for years to come. It is a shame that it is has  long since faded from memory. Although I somewhat differ from his opinions  and idiosyncrasies, I love Joe Curran in my own way that is different from  any character-audience relationship-- simply because he doesn't force the  charm on his audience... and this is helped by John G. Avildsen's  thoughtful connection. His charcter is what part of makes the final image  haunting.The story is of wealthy advertising executive William  Compton (Dennis Patrick) who murders his daughter's hippie-druggie  boyfriend (Patrick MacDermot)for turning her onto drugs and overdoses her  on speed- resulting in her hospitalization. Leaving from their hip,  low-class apartment (disgraceful for their bourgeoise existence), he meets  Joe Curran (Peter Boyle) in a bar. He listens to Joe preach to a bored  bartender about his racist and anti-hippie views. He identifies with it and  catches Joe's ear. When Joe finds that Bill actually murdered someone, he  takes him under his wing and they become unlikely friends. When Bill's  daughter (Susan Sarandon) finds out that her father murdered her boyfriend,  she goes missing in Greenwich Village. Joe now becomes obsessed with  helping him find her (after a rather humorous dinner sequence involving  Joe, Bill, and their wives). Their search takes them to a marijuana party  that later results in violence.This is a movie that our golden boy,  Oscar, totally and unfairly ignored and underrated. These performances in  &quot;Joe&quot; are top notch and tour de force and the direction is just  as effective, even more than the 1970 winner &quot;Patton.&quot; It was  terribly and brutally underrated at the Academy Awards which is a shame.  This is a beautiful film. Simply and lovingly accomplished. I loved it. It  boils over in its humor (&quot;Stop it, for Chrissake, you'd think the Pope  was comin'&quot;) and steaming social commentary. It would be a noble  gesture to restore it and release it to DVD. Putting it bluntly, it needs  more attention and more of a following. 1970 was awarded with this fine  gem.This is the #2 film on my Top Ten list and Amazon.com has an asset  with this sprawling &quot;epic.&quot; A 10!&quot;Hey Joe!

I was in high school in Southern California when Joe was first released but despite a storyline which would have appealed to hipper elements at school, I don't recall Joe ever being mentioned by anyone who fit that description nor do I recall ever reading about it in the burgeoning and ubiquitous underground press. Anyhow, to this day I have never met anyone who mentioned anything to me about this movie and indeed, I found out about it only through an amazon recommendation that appeared because of something else I bought. Anyhow, that recommendation sounded interesting so I ordered it, watched it, and overall I enjoyed it.Joe is a thought-provoking film, but it is riddled with stereotypes. Ad exec Bill Compton's world is one of money, success, and a sort of metrosexual social milieu. Joe Curran's world is combatively blue-collar, where any man with any pretense to sophistication is seen as a ""fag"", a pinko, or a n*#*#*-lover. He may have been the inspiration for Archie Bunker, the ignorant TV bigot who came to epitomize the typical conservative to a generation of sneering liberals. Curran bowled (how gauche!), he ate junk food, drank cheap beer and liquor, loved to fondle and clean his guns, and constantly railed against hippies, contemporary music and culture, and welfare parasites. He is a time-bomb just waiting to explode. The film's hippies, too, are stereotypes with their cocktail of constant drug use, communal living, libertine attitudes, and even their eating habits.So how did two such unlikely friends hook up? Unlike many others, I don't see this as a weird kind of male bonding film. I see it as the story of a guy who got sucked into a world he didn't know, like, or understand by a careless comment he made to a raving drunk in a bar. Dennis Patrick, as ad exec Bill Compton has a lot to lose. After accidentally killing his daughter's degenerate boyfriend in a fit of rage, he stops into a bar for a drink. Peter Boyle, as Joe Curran, was already in the bar loudly pontificating on welfare bums and other human effluvium. He commented to Compton that he'd like to kill a hippie. Compton, still in shock from his struggle with his daughter's boyfriend, commented that he just did. Curran introduced himself and offered to buy him a drink, but Compton left. When the story of the dead drug addict hit the news, Curran put two and two together, sought Compton out and asked to meet him. Compton, fearing blackmail, went along to meet the cunning Curran and that meeting started the spiral of events which eventually led to a tragic ending.Though Joe is somewhat dated, it is still a story that speaks to legions of parents who have suffered the heartache of seriously wayward offspring as well as being a cautionary reminder of how easily events can spiral out of control with tragic consequences. If you grew up in the late sixties or early seventies and haven't seen Joe, do so now, its like riding a time machine.",4,Thought-Provoking But Riddled With Stereotypes,1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,2995,"['How', 'did', 'miss', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'Southern', 'California', 'when', 'Joe', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'storyline', 'would', 'have', 'appealed', 'hipper', 'elements', 'school', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'Joe', 'ever', 'being', 'mentioned', 'anyone', 'who', 'fit', 'description', 'do', 'recall', 'ever', 'reading', 'burgeoning', 'ubiquitous', 'underground', 'press', 'Anyhow', 'day', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'anyone', 'who', 'mentioned', 'anything', 'movie', 'indeed', 'found', 'out', 'only', 'amazon', 'recommendation', 'appeared', 'something', 'else', 'bought', 'Anyhow', 'recommendation', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'so', 'ordered', 'watched', 'overall', 'enjoyed', 'it.Joe', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'riddled', 'stereotypes', 'Ad', 'exec', 'Bill', 'Compton', 'world', 'one', 'money', 'success', 'sort', 'metrosexual', 'social', 'milieu', 'Joe', 'Curran', 'world', 'combatively', 'blue-collar', 'where', 'man', 'pretense', 'sophistication', 'seen', 'fag', 'pinko', 'n*', '*', '*-lover', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'inspiration', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'ignorant', 'TV', 'bigot', 'who', 'came', 'epitomize', 'typical', 'conservative', 'generation', 'sneering', 'liberals', 'Curran', 'bowled', 'how', 'gauche', 'ate', 'junk', 'food', 'drank', 'cheap', 'beer', 'liquor', 'loved', 'fondle', 'clean', 'guns', 'constantly', 'railed', 'hippies', 'contemporary', 'music', 'culture', 'welfare', 'parasites', 'time-bomb', 'just', 'waiting', 'explode', 'film', 'hippies', 'too', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'cocktail', 'constant', 'drug', 'use', 'communal', 'living', 'libertine', 'attitudes', 'even', 'eating', 'habits.So', 'how', 'did', 'two', 'such', 'unlikely', 'friends', 'hook', 'up', 'many', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'weird', 'kind', 'male', 'bonding', 'film', 'see', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'sucked', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'understand', 'careless', 'comment', 'made', 'raving', 'drunk', 'bar', 'Dennis', 'Patrick', 'ad', 'exec', 'Bill', 'Compton', 'lot', 'lose', 'accidentally', 'killing', 'daughter', 'degenerate', 'boyfriend', 'fit', 'rage', 'bar', 'drink', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'Joe', 'Curran', 'was', 'already', 'bar', 'loudly', 'pontificating', 'welfare', 'bums', 'other', 'human', 'effluvium', 'commented', 'Compton', ""'d"", 'like', 'kill', 'hippie', 'Compton', 'still', 'shock', 'struggle', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'commented', 'just', 'did', 'Curran', 'introduced', 'offered', 'buy', 'drink', 'Compton', 'left', 'When', 'story', 'dead', 'drug', 'addict', 'hit', 'news', 'Curran', 'put', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'sought', 'Compton', 'asked', 'meet', 'Compton', 'fearing', 'blackmail', 'went', 'meet', 'cunning', 'Curran', 'meeting', 'started', 'spiral', 'events', 'eventually', 'led', 'tragic', 'ending.Though', 'Joe', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'still', 'story', 'legions', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'suffered', 'heartache', 'seriously', 'wayward', 'offspring', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'cautionary', 'reminder', 'how', 'easily', 'events', 'can', 'spiral', 'control', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'grew', 'up', 'late', 'sixties', 'early', 'seventies', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Joe', 'do', 'so', 'now', 'riding', 'time', 'machine']",N/A

When  Joe sits in a bar and vents his anger at this changing world, he presents a  picture of a very real human being.An act of violence brings the  business executive into Joe's world, and the two men form an odd kind of  bonding.  They might be from different economic classes but they share a  similar anger and confusion of a changing world that they are struggling to  understand.Susan Sarandon plays the hippie daughter.  This was her first  movie role and the part is small but significant.  She's young and fresh  and just at the beginning of her career.The film has a rather unsettling  effect and manages to capture all the complexities and contradictions of  its time.  I sat on the edge of my seat as the drama unfolded, glad for the  comic relief of the satirical humor.  I wonder why the sound track of the  songs never became popular.  The words were hard hitting and emotion  stirring.  Perhaps it was because it played to the festering unease that  lay simmering below the surface, just waiting to erupt.Every single  scene was laced with irony and contrast.  And every scene had its moments  that made me squirm uncomfortably.  There were no subtle nuances;  everything was crisp and clear.  And the script brought the voices of its  time to the screen without any pretty packaging.The screenplay was good,  and so was most of the acting, although in retrospect it seems a little  overdone.  But that's easy to say thirty years later, when the hippies have  all grown up and the results of the upheaval in our country turned out to  be more of social awareness than confrontative violence.  In 1970 though,  it was different.Don't miss this video.  It's an historical view of a  bygone era.

This 70's contemporary urban drama from director John G. Avildsen is pervasively raw, gritty and unflinching in its storytelling. However, this is in no way meant against the film in a negative way. On the contrary, its hard, grim style and mood serve the movie well by giving it an honest quality about it. Commendably, it attempts to accurately depict the harsh realities of urban and suburban life as well as society as a whole during the early 70's. The movie has a cool, weird vibe about it and one can tell right away that they are in for a unique moviegoing experience just from the opening credits, which are creatively displayed entirely within the main title image of the word 'Joe'.The story of 'Joe' begins with the runaway daughter of a wealthy business executive, Melissa Compton (played by a very young Susan Sarandon), who has recently been shacking up with her sleazy, dope-pusher, hippie boyfriend, Frank (Patrick McDermott), in a decaying tenement within New York City. They argue, take lots of drugs and have languid, stoned-out sex. One afternoon after Melissa follows Frank on one of his street-pharmacist sale meetings, he gives her some speedball and sends her on her way home. She instead ends up in a bargain store where she experiences a bad trip-out and breakdown and subsequently ends up in the hospital. After being located by her parents, her father, Bill (Dennis Patrick) ventures to the tenement where Frank and his daughter have been staying to recover some of her clothes and belongings. While inside the apartment, Bill encounters Frank returning home from his latest sale to two teenage girls within the building. After a brief exchange between the two, Frank provokes Bill by taunting him about Melissa. Bill briefly loses his temper and inadvertently kills him in a momentary fit of anger. Afterward he flees the scene and takes with the stash of drugs Frank has brought with him.The situation progresses from bad to worse when Bill attempts to relieve the stress and anxiety of what he's just done with a drink at a nearby bar, The American Bar & Grill. It's here that he encounters notorious regular customer and titular charcater, Joe Curran (Peter Boyle in a top-notch performance), a dangerously conservative, racist and overly-opinionated working-class factory worker. Joe passionately despises hippies, liberals, blacks, jews, homosexuals, anti-war activists and anyone else he perceives to be a threat to his values and way of life. (Joe is actually not much different from the average denizen of Fox News, or Faux News as I like to call it.) After Bill impulsively admits to Joe that he just killed the hippie, drug dealer boyfriend of his daughter to Joe, Joe is instantly intrigued. Joe's intrigue and wonder are later confirmed when he reads the story of Frank's murder in the newspaper three days later. After this, Bill becomes a personal hero to Joe and the two and the two meet up outside of work and strike up an unholy partnership and odd friendship that glaringly contrasts the socio-economic differences between Bill's life of affluence and prosperity with Joe's blue-collar schlub existence. At first, Bill doesn't share Joe's prejudices and views, but after listening to Joe's rantings and speeches, he gradually begins to believe that he may have done a noble thing by killing Frank.After Melissa learns of Frank's death and escapes from the hospital, Joe and Bill decide to find her themselves by infiltrating the local underground hippie subculture they both so hate to learn of her whereabouts. It's at this point the film takes a turn for the rather amusing and comical when the two manage to win over the trust of a young group of hippies with the tantalizing promises of the drugs Bill still has in his possession. They're invited back to a party where the two oddly start to momentarily get into the scene by taking drugs themselves and even both getting laid! After they're robbed by the group, though, they quickly snap back into focus, tracking the group down to upstate, country retreat where the film changes gears totally and races to violent, tragic and shocking ending.As you can probably guess, 'Joe' is not politically correct nor is it pretty. In many ways it's quite an ugly film but is honorable in the fact that it makes no attempt to sugar-coat its subject matter. There are several uncomfortable scenes, most notably those of drug abuse. If you're an ultra right-wing nutball, you'll probably love this movie. If you consider yourself to be liberal, this movie may not be for your taste. I can understand why some critics don't like this movie and can understand why most liberal individuals wouldn't like this movie, but as a viewer who isn't concerned with politics and simply likes a good story for its own sake, I was fairly entertained, so I'm not going to act like 'Joe' is the most horrible, hateful movie ever made.Peter Boyle's bold and outstanding performance is definitely what makes this movie. His potrayal of Joe is all at once impassioned, powerful, hypnotic, darkly humorous and definitely stays with the viewer. Watching him in this movie is like watching a train-wreck ; you just can't take your eyes off of him. Watch for the tense but darkly comical dinner scene where Joe and his wife Mary Lou (K. Callan) have Bill and his wife, Joan (Audrey Caire), over for dinner at their place where Joe proceeds to proudly show off his gun collection to Joan. Let's just say he's a long, LONG way from his beloved role of Frank the ornery grandad on the hit TV sitcom, 'Everybody Loves Raymond', a character that he makes look tame and innocent by comparison. Fans of Peter Boyle from that show may want to avert their eyes (and ears) from him here.Despite its controversy, 'Joe' deserves to be seen and is commendable for its unflinching realism and honesty, which puts it in the same category as other social commentary-themed flicks of the late 60's and early 70's such as Easy Rider, Five Easy Pieces, Dirty Harry and Death Wish. While it's decidely not pretty, it remains an important film for what is: a cultural slice of early '70's, Vietnam-era Americana and its potent reminder of the consequences that result when we take our hatred and prejudices too far.(Be sure to listen to the lyrics of the titular theme song for this movie, as they are morbidly hilarious.)

329230,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,6302719062,Muzzlehatch,"[2, 3]","Wow. What an awesome, unholy mess of a film this is. A mixture of pure trashy Cannon Group exploitation film - in the first 5 minutes we get the f-word (not so common yet in '69), Susan Sarandon's gorgeous firm 24-year-old naked tits, and her boyfriend Frank (Patrick McDermott) shooting up - and strange, not entirely consistent social commentary on the direction American society is going in. By the end of the film we've seen loads more nudity and a fairly extreme massacre sequence, plenty more drug usage, angry and resentful middle-aged white guys and stupid good-for-nothing hippies, with lots of racial expletives thrown in for good measure. Yep the Production Code had been lifted, the Summer of Love was past, and it was time to put it all out there...So the film opens with Frank and girlfriend Melissa (Sarandon) in their rundown apartment in Manhattan. Frank is a drug dealer and makes mockery of Melissa's priveleged upbringing. They fight and Frank goes out to make some money for some big project he's got - Melissa runs after him, after taking too much speed, apparently, and ends up passing out in a drugstore. Taken to a hospital, she's cared for by her parents, advertising exec Bill Compton (Dennis Patrick) and Joan (Audrey Caire). Bill goes to Melissa's apartment to get her stuff, determined to remove her from Frank's influence, but is surprised by the boyfriend, who he fights with and accidentally kills. Shaken, he goes to a nearby bar to have a couple of drinks and is a party to a drunken rage by Joe (Peter Boyle), a working-class guy who hates minorities, hates the direction the country is going in, hates the hippies - an Archie Bunker type. They have a little interaction in which Joe talks about wanting to kill one of these worthless kids and Bill blurts out that he's done it - but then quickly backpedals. The next day though, Joe finds out that a dealer was killed near the bar, and puts two and two together. He's heard Bill's name and finds his number, calls his office and a strange ""friendship"" gets started.JOE (the movie) goes in some interesting directions; it would be logical to assume that Joe (the character) intends to blackmail Bill, but he assures Bill that he's not interested in that. We the audience probably don't believe him at first any more than Bill does - but in fact, Joe doesn't seem to be interested in that. What Joe is in fact interested in is the bond that he shares with the wealthy and educated Bill - despite their class differences, Bill is every bit as conservative and hateful of the direction society is going in as Joe is. Or so Joe thinks - and so Bill is willing to pretend to be. They visit a hangout of Joe's - then a hangout of Bill's, where Bill talks about how stupid the people he works with are; Bill and Joan come to Joe's for dinner, and Joe shows Bill his extensive gun collection. It's an interesting look at the class differences, and how they are juxtaposed with the growing generational gaps - or at least, that's how the film goes for the first 2/3 or so of it's running time. Boyle is just phenomenal here and it's no surprise that this film boosted his reputation, though he shied away from similar roles afterwards for some pretty good reasons; in the last third of the film, as Joe and Bill try to find Melissa, who has disappeared, the film goes into places that so far had only been apparent in Joe's drunken rant.The hippie scene isn't particularly well portrayed here and seems awfully stereotypical - everybody's all stoned and peace-love all the time - and the very young Sarandon and some of the other young actors aren't really that convincing; but the relationship between Bill and Joe is a fascinating and fairly well-drawn one, and the ending - even if it gets pretty darned silly, as the two Angry White Men confront the hippies and let all their prejudices out in spectacular fashion - retains a visceral power even if most viewers (I suspect) have the same ""oh come on"" reaction to the last few minutes that I did.  I guess it works if one thinks of it in allegorical terms - but the film on the whole is too deliberately and brutally realistic for that option to seem intended.  Norman Wexler's screenplay got an Oscar nomination; I'm not sure that was deserved though Peter Boyle definitely deserved some recognition here. Bobby Scott's music is pretty nice, and director/cinematographer John G. Avildsen's visuals of the various sides of wealthy and seedy Manhattan, and working-class Brooklyn are understated but very compelling.All in all this is a must-see for anyone interested in where America was at in '69 I think. I'm not sure yet that I can say that it's a great film, but it was definitely a powerful and compelling experience.",4,"Crazy and all over the place, but unforgettable",1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,4752,"['Wow', 'What', 'awesome', 'unholy', 'mess', 'film', 'mixture', 'pure', 'trashy', 'Cannon', 'Group', 'exploitation', 'film', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'get', 'f-word', 'not', 'so', 'common', 'yet', ""'69"", 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'gorgeous', 'firm', '24-year-old', 'naked', 'tits', 'boyfriend', 'Frank', 'Patrick', 'McDermott', 'shooting', 'up', 'strange', 'not', 'entirely', 'consistent', 'social', 'commentary', 'direction', 'American', 'society', 'going', 'end', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'loads', 'more', 'nudity', 'fairly', 'extreme', 'massacre', 'sequence', 'plenty', 'more', 'drug', 'usage', 'angry', 'resentful', 'middle-aged', 'white', 'guys', 'stupid', 'good-for-nothing', 'hippies', 'lots', 'racial', 'expletives', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'Production', 'Code', 'had', 'been', 'lifted', 'Summer', 'Love', 'was', 'past', 'was', 'time', 'put', 'there', 'film', 'Frank', 'girlfriend', 'Melissa', 'Sarandon', 'rundown', 'apartment', 'Manhattan', 'Frank', 'drug', 'dealer', 'mockery', 'Melissa', 'priveleged', 'upbringing', 'fight', 'Frank', 'out', 'make', 'money', 'big', 'project', 'got', 'Melissa', 'taking', 'too', 'much', 'speed', 'apparently', 'up', 'passing', 'out', 'drugstore', 'Taken', 'hospital', 'cared', 'parents', 'advertising', 'exec', 'Bill', 'Compton', 'Dennis', 'Patrick', 'Joan', 'Audrey', 'Caire', 'Bill', 'Melissa', 'apartment', 'get', 'stuff', 'determined', 'remove', 'Frank', 'influence', 'surprised', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'accidentally', 'kills', 'Shaken', 'nearby', 'bar', 'have', 'couple', 'drinks', 'party', 'drunken', 'rage', 'Joe', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'working-class', 'guy', 'who', 'minorities', 'direction', 'country', 'going', 'hippies', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'type', 'have', 'little', 'interaction', 'Joe', 'talks', 'wanting', 'kill', 'one', 'worthless', 'kids', 'Bill', 'out', 'done', 'then', 'quickly', 'backpedals', 'next', 'day', 'Joe', 'out', 'dealer', 'was', 'killed', 'bar', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'heard', 'Bill', 'name', 'number', 'office', 'strange', 'friendship', 'started.JOE', 'movie', 'interesting', 'directions', 'would', 'be', 'logical', 'assume', 'Joe', 'character', 'blackmail', 'Bill', 'Bill', 'not', 'interested', 'audience', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'first', 'more', 'Bill', 'fact', 'Joe', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'interested', 'What', 'Joe', 'fact', 'interested', 'bond', 'shares', 'wealthy', 'educated', 'Bill', 'class', 'differences', 'Bill', 'bit', 'conservative', 'hateful', 'direction', 'society', 'going', 'Joe', 'so', 'Joe', 'so', 'Bill', 'willing', 'pretend', 'be', 'visit', 'hangout', 'Joe', 'then', 'hangout', 'Bill', 'where', 'Bill', 'how', 'stupid', 'people', 'are', 'Bill', 'Joan', 'come', 'Joe', 'dinner', 'Joe', 'shows', 'Bill', 'extensive', 'gun', 'collection', 'interesting', 'look', 'class', 'differences', 'how', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'growing', 'generational', 'gaps', 'least', 'how', 'film', 'first', '2/3', 'so', 'running', 'time', 'Boyle', 'just', 'phenomenal', 'here', 'surprise', 'film', 'boosted', 'reputation', 'shied', 'away', 'similar', 'roles', 'afterwards', 'pretty', 'good', 'reasons', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'Joe', 'Bill', 'try', 'find', 'Melissa', 'who', 'disappeared', 'film', 'places', 'so', 'far', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'apparent', 'Joe', 'drunken', 'rant.The', 'hippie', 'scene', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'well', 'portrayed', 'here', 'awfully', 'stereotypical', 'everybody', 'stoned', 'peace-love', 'time', 'very', 'young', 'Sarandon', 'other', 'young', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'convincing', 'relationship', 'Bill', 'Joe', 'fascinating', 'fairly', 'well-drawn', 'one', 'ending', 'even', 'pretty', 'darned', 'silly', 'two', 'Angry', 'White', 'Men', 'confront', 'hippies', 'let', 'prejudices', 'out', 'spectacular', 'fashion', 'visceral', 'power', 'even', 'most', 'viewers', 'suspect', 'have', 'same', 'oh', 'come', 'reaction', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'did', 'guess', 'one', 'allegorical', 'terms', 'film', 'whole', 'too', 'deliberately', 'brutally', 'realistic', 'option', 'seem', 'intended', 'Norman', 'Wexler', 'screenplay', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nomination', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'deserved', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'recognition', 'here', 'Bobby', 'Scott', 'music', 'pretty', 'nice', 'director/cinematographer', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'visuals', 'various', 'sides', 'wealthy', 'seedy', 'Manhattan', 'working-class', 'Brooklyn', 'are', 'understated', 'very', 'compelling.All', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'interested', 'where', 'America', 'was', ""'69"", 'think', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'yet', 'can', 'say', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'definitely', 'powerful', 'compelling', 'experience']",N/A

329232,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6302719062,Only-A-Child,"[30, 33]","Caution-possible spoilers ahead..... Just watched 'Joe' for the second time. The first time was 30+ years ago on an Air Force Base. I was reminded of that by the Air Force overcoat with Tech. Sgt. stripes wore by the boyfriend/dealer; we airmen had quite a laugh the first time that appeared on the screen because that is a 'lifer' rank. Over the years I have carried several other images from the film. Foremost was the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive. As someone else commented, you could not take you eyes off her. I did not realize until now that this was a 20-year old Susan Sarandon in her first movie. What a loss that she did not do more movies when she looked like that. I also recall the irony of having a counterculture hero like Peter Boyle playing the title role of a right-wing gun nut. Not unlike George C. Scott playing generals in Dr. Strangelove and Patton. And of course the shocking ending made a lasting impression.30+ years ago it was the most talked about movie that ever played on the base. We thought it was a great film then and I have been reluctant to see it again because I was afraid that it would be as disappointingly dated as Easy Rider. But watching it today I was amazed at how well the film has held up. It is a very strong script with few holes although you have to wonder about the boyfriend immediately getting out of the bathtub when Sarandon gets in with him.Searching for an explanation of why this film is still so entertaining I have to think it has something to do with the perfect physical casting. Boyle was physically believable as Joe (as others have pointed out his portrayal would inspire the Archie Bunker character a few 'years later). Did Ted Knight model his 'Caddyshack' character-Judge Smails after the Dennis Patrick's advertising executive in 'Joe'? They look alike and sound alike. Patrick was totally believable as the wrapped-too-tight upper middle class executive. And Sarandon's doe-eyed innocent with the Raggety Ann doll still evokes a protective response from all male viewers-perfect casting.The nude and drug scenes actually hold up (they were very provocative for their day) and are as explicit as anything to be found in 'Thirteen'. About the only thing that dates this film is that the violence is not realistic or graphic. 'Joe' was about the same time as 'The Wild Bunch', and the tone of movie violence had a just begun to change.Another reason this film holds up is that events in the past couple of years have brought back the relevancy of the theme and context of this film. In the film both types of 'conservatives' are portrayed as full of fear and hate toward the unconventional ways of the counterculture; and filled with envy at their free and hedonistic lifestyle. The counterculture is portrayed as mocking the straight culture; and although paranoid toward conservatives (legitimately so given that this was just a couple months after Kent State) they cannot resist flaunting their lifestyle in an attempt to antagonize.

Sarandon, about twenty-two years of her, plays a rich man's daughter trying to be a rebellious hippie smack user to please her boyfriend. The movie isn't about Sarandon's character; although she's integral to the plot, she in no way stars in this film. The reason I mention her is that I rented this film in the first place because I'm a fan of hers. I wasn't disappointed; she may not be the star, but does she ever shine. she has a very touching piece of business early in the film that could be hackneyed, but when she does it, I actually begin to cry. She is trying to connect emotionally with her boyfriend, but he's interested only in shooting up. They go to bed, and she tries to hold him, but he's far gone. When he passes out, she turns over to hug her Raggedy-Ann doll.But the film isn't about Sarandon. It's about a guy named Joe, an anti-hero with a tragic flaw. His flaw is the inability to understand that what he fought for in WWII was not the perpetuity of life as it was in 1945, but for freedom. Freedom implies change, and the country he thought he knew is rapidly changing. He feels betrayed. He feels that &quot;dose hippies&quot; he perceives as responsible for the change have turned their backs on him, have thumbed their noses at all he has done.At this point, when the film begins, in a bar where Joe is bathing his grievances in alcohol, he meets Jill's (Sarandon)father. Joe is muttering to anyone in earshot that he would love to kill a hippie. They form an unholy alliance.Becoming further rebellious, Jill runs away, out of contact with her father (she has a reason, but I won't spoil things for you), so her father and Joe go looking for her.This doesn't seem like much for the plot of a movie, but trust me, it becomes intense; intense and riveting. Edge of your seat stuff. And the ending is a shocker. It's up there with the ending of The Blair Witch Project. In fact, I don't recommend anyone watch this film alone.I do recommend that people watch the film, however, in groups. The camera style is a little dated, but it's still effective, and the sound track is great! The use of the sound is great too: restrained, none of that music video halfway through the film, as in all the films from the nineties. There are plenty of places where there's no dialogue, and no soundtrack, and this is very effective.Its message is still quite relevant; WWII and hippies may be gone, but they're replaced by other things; anyone can identify with this film.",5,Still True after All These Years,1006819200,"11 27, 2001",2001,2563,"['Susan', 'Sarandon', 'film', 'career', 'twisted', 'little', 'film', '1970', 'Sarandon', 'twenty-two', 'years', 'rich', 'man', 'daughter', 'trying', 'be', 'rebellious', 'hippie', 'smack', 'user', 'please', 'boyfriend', 'movie', ""n't"", 'Sarandon', 'character', 'integral', 'plot', 'way', 'film', 'reason', 'mention', 'rented', 'film', 'first', 'place', ""'m"", 'fan', 'hers', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'star', 'ever', 'shine', 'very', 'touching', 'piece', 'business', 'early', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'hackneyed', 'when', 'actually', 'begin', 'cry', 'trying', 'connect', 'emotionally', 'boyfriend', 'interested', 'only', 'shooting', 'up', 'go', 'bed', 'hold', 'far', 'gone', 'When', 'out', 'hug', 'Raggedy-Ann', 'doll.But', 'film', ""n't"", 'about', 'Sarandon', 'guy', 'named', 'Joe', 'anti-hero', 'tragic', 'flaw', 'flaw', 'inability', 'understand', 'what', 'fought', 'WWII', 'was', 'not', 'perpetuity', 'life', 'was', '1945', 'freedom', 'Freedom', 'change', 'country', 'thought', 'knew', 'rapidly', 'changing', 'betrayed', 'quot', 'dose', 'hippies', 'quot', 'responsible', 'change', 'have', 'turned', 'backs', 'have', 'thumbed', 'noses', 'done.At', 'point', 'when', 'film', 'bar', 'where', 'Joe', 'bathing', 'grievances', 'alcohol', 'Jill', 'Sarandon', 'father', 'Joe', 'muttering', 'anyone', 'earshot', 'would', 'love', 'kill', 'hippie', 'form', 'unholy', 'alliance.Becoming', 'further', 'rebellious', 'Jill', 'away', 'contact', 'father', 'reason', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'things', 'father', 'Joe', 'go', 'looking', 'her.This', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'plot', 'movie', 'intense', 'intense', 'riveting', 'Edge', 'seat', 'stuff', 'ending', 'shocker', 'up', 'there', 'ending', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'watch', 'film', 'alone.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'people', 'watch', 'film', 'however', 'groups', 'camera', 'style', 'little', 'dated', 'still', 'effective', 'sound', 'track', 'great', 'use', 'sound', 'great', 'too', 'restrained', 'none', 'music', 'video', 'halfway', 'film', 'films', 'nineties', 'are', 'plenty', 'places', 'where', 'dialogue', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'effective.Its', 'message', 'still', 'quite', 'relevant', 'WWII', 'hippies', 'may', 'be', 'gone', ""'re"", 'replaced', 'other', 'things', 'anyone', 'can', 'identify', 'film']",N/A
