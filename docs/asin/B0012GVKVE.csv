Gina and Matin are married in this season and after that, their chemistry kinda took a nosedive.

This, to me, is the best season - each episode is hilarious and I really enjoy watching it.  I really love the fighting that goes on between Martin and Pam.  They act like kids but keep coming up with fantastic insults.I love the episode Cole On Ice where Martin gets Charles Barkley to appear on his talkshow, yet Cole ruins it and Charles backs out.  There is even a special episode where Tisha Campbell hosts 'the best' of Martin throughout the beginning to the 100 episode.  There's also the one where it's Martins birthday and there is a video message to him from Halle Berry and Chris Rock.I think this is finally the season for the real comedy to shine through without some of the sillyness that previous seasons had.  Now that I'm caught up on seasons 1-4, I'm hanging out for season 5 to be released.
