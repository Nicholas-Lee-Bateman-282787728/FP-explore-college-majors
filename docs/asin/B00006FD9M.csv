[Beds are placed at knee level.] This seems to be a one-room apartment. [Like a shack or low-rent NY tenement?] His bed-mate awakes. Alice is told to let his cat in, and be gone by noon. [What man wakes in the morning without needing a shave?] McCoy drive to a large mansion that is guarded by a large dog. He enters a cold room. There was a burglary of diamonds. The man believed to be responsible was found dead. His job is to find out who killed him for $10,000. [A lot more money then.] McCoy visits an apartment, there is violence, and he gets his answers. He goes to a ""health club"" in the Village. It is crowded. McCoy gets information about Bolton. He visits a book store and talks about books. Later he fights with a man to get information. Man grab him at night to beat him and tell him to forget about Pappas. He is told about Montane. Where did he get the money? McCoy goes to a building on Sutton Place to see Felix and meets his sister.They talk about Pappas. McCoy drives on the West Side. He visits a restaurant and dines. Can they find out more about Pappas? What about the guys that beat up McCoy? Felix's sister asks McCoy to follow him. Who lent the money to Felix? McCoy goes to investigate that warehouse. Breaking and entering? He is discovered! There is more action as men with pistols chase him! Back home he meets Felix's sister. Then his employer, where McCoy quits. Men take him to a warehouse to view a body! He is warned about his possible fate. Felix often dined with Lt. Col. Hardcore about business. McCoy visits Hardcore about buying surplus military supplies. Some men shoot at them, but they escape. McCoy visits that eccentric millionaire where he finds Felix. Will both of them be eliminated? That large dog disarms McCoy. There is an unexpected event and McCoy escapes. He is hunted among the shrubbery. He runs away and dodges bullets. The shots bring the police. They collect the survivors. McCoy returns to his room. Alexis leaves. And so it ends.This isn't much of a story. There have been plenty of private investigator movies over the years. Most military equipment is sold by the US government to foreign nations, and is often used against their subjects or a neighboring country (also armed by the USA). You need a good story for a food movie.",2,Solving a Murder,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,2388,"['Shamus', '1972', 'filmA', 'man', 'private', 'investigator', 'do', 'job', 'Can', 'pool', 'table', 'be', 'used', 'bed', '[', 'Beds', 'are', 'placed', 'knee', 'level', ']', 'be', 'one-room', 'apartment', '[', 'shack', 'low-rent', 'NY', 'tenement', ']', 'bed-mate', 'awakes', 'Alice', 'told', 'let', 'cat', 'be', 'gone', 'noon', '[', 'What', 'man', 'morning', 'needing', 'shave', ']', 'McCoy', 'drive', 'large', 'mansion', 'guarded', 'large', 'dog', 'cold', 'room', 'was', 'burglary', 'diamonds', 'man', 'believed', 'be', 'responsible', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'job', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killed', '10,000', '[', 'lot', 'more', 'money', 'then', ']', 'McCoy', 'visits', 'apartment', 'violence', 'answers', 'health', 'club', 'Village', 'crowded', 'McCoy', 'information', 'Bolton', 'book', 'store', 'talks', 'books', 'Later', 'man', 'get', 'information', 'Man', 'grab', 'night', 'beat', 'tell', 'forget', 'Pappas', 'told', 'Montane', 'Where', 'did', 'get', 'money', 'McCoy', 'building', 'Sutton', 'Place', 'see', 'Felix', 'sister.They', 'talk', 'Pappas', 'McCoy', 'West', 'Side', 'restaurant', 'dines', 'Can', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'Pappas', 'What', 'guys', 'beat', 'up', 'McCoy', 'Felix', 'sister', 'McCoy', 'follow', 'Who', 'lent', 'money', 'Felix', 'McCoy', 'investigate', 'warehouse', 'Breaking', 'entering', 'discovered', 'more', 'action', 'men', 'pistols', 'chase', 'Back', 'home', 'Felix', 'sister', 'Then', 'employer', 'where', 'McCoy', 'Men', 'take', 'warehouse', 'view', 'body', 'warned', 'possible', 'fate', 'Felix', 'often', 'dined', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Hardcore', 'business', 'McCoy', 'Hardcore', 'buying', 'surplus', 'military', 'supplies', 'men', 'shoot', 'escape', 'McCoy', 'eccentric', 'millionaire', 'where', 'Felix', 'Will', 'be', 'eliminated', 'large', 'dog', 'disarms', 'McCoy', 'unexpected', 'event', 'McCoy', 'escapes', 'hunted', 'shrubbery', 'away', 'bullets', 'shots', 'bring', 'police', 'collect', 'survivors', 'McCoy', 'room', 'Alexis', ""n't"", 'much', 'story', 'have', 'been', 'plenty', 'private', 'investigator', 'movies', 'years', 'Most', 'military', 'equipment', 'sold', 'US', 'government', 'foreign', 'nations', 'often', 'used', 'subjects', 'neighboring', 'country', 'also', 'armed', 'USA', 'need', 'good', 'story', 'food', 'movie']",N/A

It was before he got caught in formula driven audience (of the time) pleasers, and it's an example of one of the things he did best. You can add this to Deliverance, Sharkey's Machine  and Starting Over as the ones he hit out of the park.It updates the down and out private investigator tale, and it does it with a gritty, contemporary style. Reynolds is believable, witty and tough (his stuntman days kick in here and much of what we see on screen- including that fall, is him).The story is well crafted (and pre-Iran/Contra- which make it really interesting- the 'sales pitch scene' at the army base being priceless). It came and went pretty fast in the theatres but it had some real style that was overlooked. The lines are witty: "" Why did you pick me? "" "" You weren't the first choice. "" "" Oh... 2nd or 3rd? "" "" No... the 56th. "" "" Next time lie, okay? ""Dyan Cannon balances Reynolds, and the rest of the support cast play the mood out well. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it a real bounce, too. Morris the Cat from the famous old commercials even does a guest stint as Reynold's cat (no voice overs, though), and the film offers an interesting example of how diverse a pool table can be!If you didn't like Reynold's work, watch this and you'll like him in this. If you did like him... watch this and enjoy what he did best. This is a good PI picture with a story that had some reality to it.
