1249079,A3B5MYBEG5AZ66,B0023T9ZR0,Alex Craig,"[6, 6]","This is a most enjoyable DVD. I am a musician, not a dance connoisseur, and my enjoyment of ballet reflects primarily how the dance interacts with a great musical score. Here we have two of Stravinsky's great early ballets, with restored choreography from the epochal original productions by Dyagilev's Ballets Russes, produced by one of Russia's great dance companies, and led by a great Russian conductor. How could one miss? ""The Firebird"" is beautiful classical dance, with a fanciful scenario and brilliant stage effects to match the inimitably colorful music. I have a copy of the PBS program about the restoration of the ""Rite of Spring"" choreography. The performance there by the Joffrey Ballet is very good, but this one is better; the dancing is more polished, the costumes more vibrant, and Gergiev's conducting more dynamic. We all know about the riot the original production produced; it's less known that when ""The Rite of Spring"" was played in concert in 1915 the audience loved it. Seeing this staging, I wonder if the first audience was offended by the choreography as much as the music ... Wouldn't it be nice if Gergiev and company would follow up with ""Petrushka"" and ""Les Noces""? And wouldn't it be great to have well-filmed productions of the two great French ballets Dyagilev commissioned: Ravel's ""Daphnis et Chlo&eacute;"" and Debussy's ""Jeux""?",5,Wonderful productions,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,1368,"['most', 'enjoyable', 'DVD', 'am', 'musician', 'not', 'dance', 'connoisseur', 'enjoyment', 'ballet', 'primarily', 'how', 'dance', 'great', 'musical', 'score', 'Here', 'have', 'two', 'Stravinsky', 'great', 'early', 'ballets', 'restored', 'choreography', 'epochal', 'original', 'productions', 'Dyagilev', 'Ballets', 'Russes', 'produced', 'one', 'Russia', 'great', 'dance', 'companies', 'led', 'great', 'Russian', 'conductor', 'How', 'could', 'one', 'miss', 'Firebird', 'beautiful', 'classical', 'dance', 'fanciful', 'scenario', 'brilliant', 'stage', 'effects', 'match', 'inimitably', 'colorful', 'music', 'have', 'copy', 'PBS', 'program', 'restoration', 'Rite', 'Spring', 'choreography', 'performance', 'there', 'Joffrey', 'Ballet', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'better', 'dancing', 'more', 'polished', 'costumes', 'more', 'vibrant', 'Gergiev', 'conducting', 'more', 'dynamic', 'know', 'riot', 'original', 'production', 'produced', 'less', 'known', 'when', 'Rite', 'Spring', 'was', 'played', 'concert', '1915', 'audience', 'loved', 'Seeing', 'staging', 'wonder', 'first', 'audience', 'was', 'offended', 'choreography', 'as', 'much', 'music', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nice', 'Gergiev', 'company', 'would', 'follow', 'up', 'Petrushka', 'Les', 'Noces', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'have', 'well-filmed', 'productions', 'two', 'great', 'French', 'ballets', 'Dyagilev', 'commissioned', 'Ravel', 'Daphnis', 'Chlo', 'eacute', 'Debussy', 'Jeux']",Stravinsky and the Ballets Russes: The Firebird/Le Sacre du Printemps

THE best musical interpretation of either of these ballets I've ever heard.As far as 'Firebird' goes, Ekaterina Kondaurova's interpretation of the role was technically perfect. There is no question that she did all of the choreography flawlessly, it was just missing &#8230; SOUL. Especially in that entrancing pas de deux where the prince catches the firebird, she had NO emotion on her face whatsoever. Where's the desperation and anguish at suddenly having your freedom ripped from you? Nowhere to be seen, which was disappointing as that pas de deux is my favorite part. Margot Fonteyn nailed it, and I'm fond of Diana Vishneva's Firebird, if you're looking for other good interpretations of the role.The Rite of Spring is a revival of the original choreography, and retained all of the creepy drone-like qualities of the 1980's production. I'm glad I own this now, as the video quality of that older production is not very good.

For a ballet considered ""lost"" for many years, this effort seemed to bring history alive.  I had read about the riots on opening night.  I could understand the assault of the orchestral dissonance to an audience which apparently had advance knowledge of what they were about to hear: that the music would be daunting to them.  Then to be confronted by knock-kneed, expressionless, flat-footed rhythmic dancing was the final insult.In this DVD, much of the impact is unfortunately mitigated by poor editing, close-ups, and showy Berkeley-esque camera angles (from the ceiling, no less).  The dancers seem much more disorganized in their groups because of these issues, although the rehearsal footage doesn't exactly convince me that the ballet masters enforced the rhythmic fidelity upon which Nijinsky would have insisted.  There is a lack of tautness that results in a lack of conviction.  It is not the indifferent faces of the dances, especially the sacrificial virgin; Nijinsky surely hoped the music would convey the primal emotions of his dancers.  Although Gergiev brings some insight to the conducting, he is often self-indulgent.  It is also clear that the scenery and costumes are glitzy adaptations of the Roerich originals.The Joffrey performance, which was filmed for PBS, exists on a (possibly bootlegged) DVD, available on the Net.  I don't know whether the DVD is licensed, but I assume not.  That performance should be reissued on disc.  It does the ballet justice.We also are subjected to pretentious prattle of Millicent Hodson, the restorer of this ballet.  She attributes a kind of metaphysical aspect to Nijinsky's creativity, forgetting completely that the idea for the ballet came to Stravinsky in a dream.  Nijinsky was a more simple, emotional creator than an intellectual.  He did research, which she totally ignores.The performance of ""The Firebird"" is not as accomplished as the Royal Ballet DVD.  Leanne Benjamin gets all the humor that Karsavina would have brought to the role.  But Ekaterina Kandaurova is astonishing; not just visually stunning, but also full of humor.  She has the most beautiful hands I have ever seen on any dancer, including Maya and Margot.  The princess, in contrast, played by Marianna Pavlova (hmm...), is as graceful as Jane Krakowski.  There is no love in her eyes for the prince.  No enchantment.  Don't be tempted to purchase the DVD entitled ""Return of the Firebird;""  the makeup is so heavy, the characters look like hookers.

1249082,A1K548TDR33DMN,B0023T9ZR0,Anna Shlimovich,"[20, 23]","Prepare yourself for the most frustrating viewing experience!  Right from the start the camera seemingly deliberately cuts the feet of dancers;  then it pans in and out, moves as a drunkard, and finally, as not being able to entertain itself with the performance, it starts filming it from the top!WHO was behind the camera?  It feels as ""they"" had absolutely no appreciation of what they are filming;  no understanding of ballet as an art form; no conception of the fact that it speaks with a body, not a face and not with one body part shot close-up style.  What makes it especially ruinous here, in ""Le Sacre du printemps"", that as the choreographer herself speaks in Bonus section, there are NO prima ballerina or center characters; EACH dancer dances his own part and each person on stage is equally important.  Well, was that known to the cameraman?  Why was a decent performance allowed to be so crudely decimated by the ignorant and careless?Apart from the hideous camera work, there are other things that are not perfect.  Although the dancers in this ""Firebird"" are beautiful, their dancing is average; again, the atrocious close-ups of the camera do not help appreciating their skill and choreography.  The orchestra sounds somewhat dull; Georgiev looks unkempt and unclean.  Watching and listening to this, I suddenly asked myself - how is it that we see only Georgiev from Kirov? Don't they have other conductors, young talents, etc.?  Maybe it is time for some shake-up there, so poorly was the whole Firebird done.  There are a few other Firebirds on DVD, done with exactly the same mis-en-scene and designs by Goncharova which could be much highly recommended - I personally like very much the one done by The Royal Ballet of Covent Garden with Leanne Benjamin in the title role; there you can truly see and hear The Firebird  instead of this tepid Swamp Lake.Next on this DVD is ""Le Sacre du Printemps"" ballet which is not as readily available as a ballet, although there are plenty of recordings.  It is exactly due to the rarity of Le Sacre on DVD that this camera work comes across as criminal, because in this ballet the DVD producers really ruined the show which otherwise seems to be pretty good, or at least valuable from the historic standpoint.I would truly love to see better Nicolai Rerikh (Nicolas Roerich) decorations;  it is so precious to see as it was seen by Parisian audience roughly 100 years ago.  And although you get a glimpse of it in this film,  the camera moves again in a totally chaotic, insane fashion, depriving the viewer from enjoying the so very well-thought inventive choreography of Vaslav Nijinsky.  Yet even with this atrocious camera work, one could still grasp an idea of what a great innovation this whole opus was; the music and choreograhy are so avant-garde, and remain so today!  It was also amusing to hear an ovation at the end of Le Sacre - I doubt very much that the contemporary Russian public truly love this music - it is so far from the tradition of Social Realism and all on what Soviet people raised... Also, one feels once more that this Stravinsky's music is really not suited well to being performed as an orchestral piece, as it is most often heard - Le Sacre music  was really written for the ballet, and without the visual it is impossible to understand it fully.Overall, the impression of this DVD is that it was done by some amateur filmmaker who had no understanding or appreciation for what he was filming; it is therefore very frustrating to watch, especially imagining how you could see it with your own eyes there, in the actual theater.  Unfortunately, this is another sad example of ignorant making of the ballet film; it shows that opera obviously suffers less from poor filmmaking since it's much less visual, while in ballet it is really the core and the essence - the show.  It is irredeemable if it's ruined as in this film.Yet for Le Sacre I still give it four stars, so my overall rating of this film is 3 stars, simply for the historical and educational significance of ""Le Sacre du printemps"" part on it.",3,Wetbird of a Swamp Lake.,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,4098,"['Prepare', 'most', 'frustrating', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Right', 'start', 'camera', 'seemingly', 'deliberately', 'feet', 'dancers', 'then', 'moves', 'drunkard', 'finally', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'entertain', 'performance', 'filming', 'top', 'WHO', 'was', 'camera', 'had', 'absolutely', 'appreciation', 'what', 'are', 'filming', 'understanding', 'ballet', 'art', 'form', 'conception', 'fact', 'body', 'not', 'face', 'not', 'one', 'body', 'part', 'shot', 'close-up', 'style', 'What', 'especially', 'ruinous', 'here', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'du', 'printemps', 'choreographer', 'Bonus', 'section', 'are', 'NO', 'prima', 'ballerina', 'center', 'characters', 'EACH', 'dancer', 'own', 'part', 'person', 'stage', 'equally', 'important', 'Well', 'was', 'known', 'cameraman', 'Why', 'was', 'decent', 'performance', 'allowed', 'be', 'so', 'crudely', 'decimated', 'ignorant', 'careless', 'Apart', 'hideous', 'camera', 'work', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'dancers', 'Firebird', 'are', 'beautiful', 'dancing', 'average', 'again', 'atrocious', 'close-ups', 'camera', 'do', 'not', 'help', 'appreciating', 'skill', 'choreography', 'orchestra', 'somewhat', 'dull', 'Georgiev', 'unkempt', 'unclean', 'Watching', 'listening', 'suddenly', 'asked', 'how', 'see', 'only', 'Georgiev', 'Kirov', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'conductors', 'young', 'talents', 'etc.', 'Maybe', 'time', 'shake-up', 'there', 'poorly', 'was', 'whole', 'Firebird', 'done', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'Firebirds', 'DVD', 'done', 'exactly', 'same', 'mis-en-scene', 'designs', 'Goncharova', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'highly', 'recommended', 'personally', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'done', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'Covent', 'Garden', 'Leanne', 'Benjamin', 'title', 'role', 'can', 'truly', 'see', 'hear', 'Firebird', 'instead', 'tepid', 'Swamp', 'Lake.Next', 'DVD', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'du', 'Printemps', 'ballet', 'not', 'readily', 'available', 'ballet', 'are', 'plenty', 'recordings', 'exactly', 'due', 'rarity', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'DVD', 'camera', 'work', 'across', 'criminal', 'ballet', 'DVD', 'producers', 'really', 'ruined', 'show', 'otherwise', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'least', 'valuable', 'historic', 'standpoint.I', 'would', 'truly', 'love', 'see', 'better', 'Nicolai', 'Rerikh', 'Nicolas', 'Roerich', 'decorations', 'so', 'precious', 'see', 'was', 'seen', 'Parisian', 'audience', 'roughly', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'get', 'glimpse', 'film', 'camera', 'again', 'totally', 'chaotic', 'insane', 'fashion', 'depriving', 'viewer', 'enjoying', 'so', 'very', 'well-thought', 'inventive', 'choreography', 'Vaslav', 'Nijinsky', 'even', 'atrocious', 'camera', 'work', 'one', 'could', 'still', 'grasp', 'idea', 'what', 'great', 'innovation', 'whole', 'opus', 'was', 'music', 'choreograhy', 'are', 'so', 'avant-garde', 'remain', 'so', 'today', 'was', 'also', 'amusing', 'hear', 'ovation', 'end', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'doubt', 'very', 'much', 'contemporary', 'Russian', 'public', 'truly', 'music', 'so', 'far', 'tradition', 'Social', 'Realism', 'what', 'Soviet', 'people', 'raised', 'Also', 'one', 'feels', 'once', 'more', 'Stravinsky', 'music', 'really', 'not', 'suited', 'well', 'being', 'performed', 'orchestral', 'piece', 'most', 'often', 'heard', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'music', 'was', 'really', 'written', 'ballet', 'visual', 'impossible', 'understand', 'fully.Overall', 'impression', 'DVD', 'was', 'done', 'amateur', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'had', 'understanding', 'appreciation', 'what', 'was', 'filming', 'therefore', 'very', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'especially', 'imagining', 'how', 'could', 'see', 'own', 'eyes', 'there', 'actual', 'theater', 'Unfortunately', 'sad', 'example', 'ignorant', 'making', 'ballet', 'film', 'opera', 'obviously', 'less', 'poor', 'filmmaking', 'much', 'less', 'visual', 'ballet', 'really', 'core', 'essence', 'show', 'irredeemable', 'ruined', 'film.Yet', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'still', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'overall', 'rating', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'simply', 'historical', 'educational', 'significance', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'du', 'printemps', 'part']",Stravinsky and the Ballets Russes: The Firebird/Le Sacre du Printemps

1249085,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B0023T9ZR0,I. Giles,"[2, 2]","This disc offers two major ballets by Stravinsky plus an interesting and detailed bonus feature to support the productions. The productions are a determined attempt to recreate the two ballets as originally envisioned by Fokine and Bakst (Firebird 1910) and Nijinsky (Rite 1913). The Firebird was not too difficult to research as this choreography had not previously been lost and is familiar as the basis of most modern performances. The Rite is much more of a problem as Nijinsky did not notate it for posterity. This production has been painstakingly recreated from a considerable number of sources, not least the highly detailed criticisms received from the press and other opponents.As mentioned above, this performance of the Firebird uses familiar choreography and settings such as in the earlier Royal Ballet version on Opus Arte or the freer Russian TV film version available on Decca. This new production, I find, presents a friendlier Firebird character - slightly less dramatic facial make-up and actions, but essentially the same. The dancing is exquisitly done by the four main characters of the Firebird (Ekaterina Kondaurova), The Prince (Ilya Kuznetsov), the princess (Marianna Pavlova) and Kashchei (Vladimir Ponomarev). The corps de ballet perform with the excellence we all expect from the Kirov Ballet. This is an outstanding account.The Rite is more ground-breaking in concept. One major change is the way that at times all 47 members of the ballet are separately choreographed as if individual soloists. This fragmentation is intended to maximise the limited stage space and was a Nijinsky innovation which he first tried out in Debussy's 'Afternoon of a Faun' ballet - also the subject of audience unrest. Other new effects include instances of foot stamping and hitting the floor with choreographed hand slaps to create additional sound effects that were clearly meant to be heard and thus create an extra dimension.The choreography is very stylised in its portrayal of a primitive Rite but, with its use of bright colours for costumes, is generally effective on its own terms. However, the curious idea of pigeon-toed choreography seems to me to be merely odd rather than primal. The dancers do all that is required of them here though and they do it as well as could be expected. Where the choreography mainly fails to convince for me is the final dance to the exhaustive death of the chosen victim. This is just not wild enough - she barely breaks sweat. Instead it seems that she dies largely as a result of fear - she stands transfixed for extended periods of time. Basically it seems to me that the choreography simply fails to match the violent intent of the music and it is this that I am sure could be better done by choreographers working today - I have been told that there is a version by MacMillan for instance.However, that is hardly the point. The point is that with this recording we are able to gain a real insight into the past and what has contributed so much to our present and will lead to the future. An invaluable documents therefore.The imaging is crisp and with excellent colour rendition. The dancers are seen from various angles including vertically downwards from above. This gives an interesting additional idea of the layout on the stage but not that as originally envisioned. The use of close-up imaging is interesting at times but more full-stage shots would have been even more rewarding in my opinion. The sound is spectacular in the DTS surround format and reveals every footfall of the dancers and one can be in no doubt about their weight and the effort required for the lifts! Stereo is also available. The orchestral contribution is fully revealed as expert in its precision under Gergiev.The bonus is interesting as already mentioned above but it is for the two ballets, and especially for the Rite, that this will be bought.

1249086,A1CT3VC2YHL2NC,B0023T9ZR0,John J. Schauer,"[1, 1]","Since I bought this DVD for the reconstruction of Nijinsky&#8217;s choreography of &#34;The Rite of Spring,&#34; and considered &#34;The Firebird&#34; merely a nice bonus, I will restrict my comments to the former work. I have loved the score for over 50 years, and during that time have seen numerous productions with new choreography that, in my opinion, never seemed to have much to do with the actual music, leaving me (along with millions of others) to wonder what the world premiere production might have looked like. When I saw The Joffrey Ballet performing Millicent Hodson&#8217;s reconstruction in 1987, it was a revelation, everything I hoped (and had imagined) it could be. The miracle of Nijinsky&#8217;s choreography, at least so far as we can recreate it, is that for once, virtually every note of Stravinsky&#8217;s dazzlingly complex score is made manifest on the stage.Unfortunately, you&#8217;ll have to take my word for it, because Denis Caozzi, the director of this video, apparently doesn&#8217;t care very much about choreography. Time and again he goes in for close-ups of a single dancer&#8217;s face, which makes no sense at all. Keep in mind that in a live performance, dancers are NEVER meant to be seen in close-up. Stage makeup is specifically designed to be seen from a distance, unless you think it contributes to the aesthetic experience to see the dancers&#8217; false eyelashes or the cord running under their chin to secure their wigs and headdresses in place. As a friend of mine once said, I don&#8217;t EVER want a director to decide for us that we don&#8217;t need to see the dancers&#8217; feet. In the opening scene, for example, while multiple groups of dancers are each doing different steps, brilliantly matching Stravinsky&#8217;s astonishing cross-rhythms and syncopations, the camera closes in on the face of the Old Woman and holds the shot, as if no one else were on the stage at all. At the beginning of the second half, as the maidens are moving in a circle, the camera shows only the left half of the circle, with totally bare stage next to it. Why? And the overhead shots are ludicrous (note to Mr. Caozzi: You are not Busby Berkeley), and seeing the circular markings on the stage covering&#8212;totally invisible to an actual audience&#8212;only makes the less-than-precision movements by the corps even more bothersome. I had the feeling that if he could, he would have had a floor-level camera looking up so we could see the dancers&#8217; underwear.As others have noted, the production as originally filmed by The Joffrey Ballet for the PBS &#8220;Dance in America&#8221; series in the late 1980s is vastly superior. I was lucky to be able to videotape that performance when it was first broadcast, and I just rewatched it to compare it to this Mariinsky production. The Joffrey is the company for whom Hodson first crafted her reconstruction, and they presented the world premiere of it. So it isn&#8217;t surprising that their dancing boasts more precision, more focus and greater dedication to the drama than their Russian colleagues. More important, you can SEE the choreography in the Joffrey video. It&#8217;s nice to have Hodson&#8217;s historic reconstruction available on a Blu-ray DVD, but unfortunately this disc is nowhere near the achievement it could have been. A wasted opportunity if there ever was one. What a crying shame that the Joffrey version was never released on DVD.",3,HISTORIC RECONSTRUCTION OF THE RITE OF SPRING--WHAT YOU CAN SEE OF IT,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,3450,"['bought', 'DVD', 'reconstruction', 'Nijinsky', '8217', 'choreography', '34', 'Rite', 'Spring', '34', 'considered', '34', 'Firebird', '34', 'merely', 'nice', 'bonus', 'will', 'restrict', 'comments', 'former', 'work', 'have', 'loved', 'score', '50', 'years', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'numerous', 'productions', 'new', 'choreography', 'opinion', 'never', 'seemed', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'actual', 'music', 'leaving', 'millions', 'others', 'wonder', 'what', 'world', 'premiere', 'production', 'might', 'have', 'looked', 'When', 'saw', 'Joffrey', 'Ballet', 'performing', 'Millicent', 'Hodson', '8217', 's', 'reconstruction', '1987', 'was', 'revelation', 'everything', 'hoped', 'had', 'imagined', 'could', 'be', 'miracle', 'Nijinsky', '8217', 'choreography', 'least', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'recreate', 'once', 'virtually', 'note', 'Stravinsky', '8217', 's', 'dazzlingly', 'complex', 'score', 'made', 'manifest', 'stage.Unfortunately', '8217', 'll', 'have', 'take', 'word', 'Denis', 'Caozzi', 'director', 'video', 'apparently', '8217', 'care', 'very', 'much', 'choreography', 'Time', 'again', 'close-ups', 'single', 'dancer', '8217', 's', 'face', 'sense', 'Keep', 'mind', 'live', 'performance', 'dancers', 'are', 'NEVER', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'close-up', 'Stage', 'makeup', 'specifically', 'designed', 'be', 'seen', 'distance', 'think', 'aesthetic', 'experience', 'see', 'dancers', '8217', 'false', 'eyelashes', 'cord', 'running', 'chin', 'secure', 'wigs', 'headdresses', 'place', 'friend', 'mine', 'once', 'said', 'don', '8217', 'EVER', 'want', 'director', 'decide', 'don', '8217', 'need', 'see', 'dancers', '8217', 'feet', 'opening', 'scene', 'example', 'multiple', 'groups', 'dancers', 'are', 'doing', 'different', 'steps', 'brilliantly', 'matching', 'Stravinsky', '8217', 's', 'astonishing', 'cross-rhythms', 'syncopations', 'camera', 'face', 'Old', 'Woman', 'shot', 'one', 'else', 'were', 'stage', 'beginning', 'second', 'half', 'maidens', 'are', 'moving', 'circle', 'camera', 'only', 'left', 'half', 'circle', 'totally', 'bare', 'stage', 'next', 'Why', 'overhead', 'shots', 'are', 'ludicrous', 'note', 'Mr.', 'Caozzi', 'are', 'not', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', 'seeing', 'circular', 'markings', 'stage', 'covering', '8212', 'totally', 'invisible', 'actual', 'audience', '8212', 'only', 'less-than-precision', 'movements', 'corps', 'even', 'more', 'bothersome', 'had', 'feeling', 'could', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'floor-level', 'camera', 'looking', 'up', 'could', 'see', 'dancers', '8217', 'underwear.As', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'production', 'originally', 'filmed', 'Joffrey', 'Ballet', 'PBS', '8220', 'Dance', 'America', '8221', 'series', 'late', '1980s', 'vastly', 'superior', 'was', 'lucky', 'be', 'able', 'videotape', 'performance', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'just', 'rewatched', 'compare', 'Mariinsky', 'production', 'Joffrey', 'company', 'whom', 'Hodson', 'first', 'crafted', 'reconstruction', 'presented', 'world', 'premiere', '8217', 'surprising', 'dancing', 'more', 'precision', 'more', 'focus', 'greater', 'dedication', 'drama', 'Russian', 'colleagues', 'More', 'important', 'can', 'SEE', 'choreography', 'Joffrey', 'video', '8217', 's', 'nice', 'have', 'Hodson', '8217', 'historic', 'reconstruction', 'available', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'unfortunately', 'disc', 'nowhere', 'achievement', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'What', 'crying', 'shame', 'Joffrey', 'version', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'DVD']",Stravinsky and the Ballets Russes: The Firebird/Le Sacre du Printemps
1249087,A3IDOT2AUW8NBU,B0023T9ZR0,Matthew Wilcox,"[99, 102]","Finding a decent production of Stravinsky's first ballet, The Firebird, on DVD is fairly easy.  Finding one of his most popular (and notorious) ballet, Le Sacre du Printemps (The Rite of Spring), is not so easy.  Thankfully, this DVD contains both of these great 20th century works, performed energetically by the Mariinsky Orchestra and Ballet, under the baton of the great Russian conductor Valery Gergiev.CD recordings of both of these works, conducted by Gergiev, have received positive reviews.  For this DVD, great care went into researching and trying to reconstruct the original choreography.  The faithful reproduction of these works are primarily the responsibility of dance historian Kenneth Archer and choreographer Millicent Hodson.  Both took great care in presenting these ballets as they might have been seen in 1910 and, scandalously, in 1913, when the debut of Le Sacre du Printemps caused a riot when it appeared at the Theatre des Champs-Elysees.Fans of ballet and contemporary dance should not hesitate in picking up this DVD.  Both performances were filmed in HD, and many camera angles (including aerial) are used to show the work that went into staging these great ballets.  Extras include an interview with Archer and Hodson, rehearsal sequences, and historical information about Stravinsky, the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, and the impresario Serge Diaghilev.  This DVD is released in time to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Ballet Russes.Igor Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring / Alexander Scriabin: The Poem of Ecstasy - Valery Gergiev / Kirov OrchestraIgor Stravinsky: The Firebird (Complete Ballet, 1910) / Alexander Scriabin: Prometheus - The Poem of Fire - Valery Gergiev / Kirov Orchestra, St. Petersburg / Alexander Toradze",5,Authentic reproductions of two great Stravinsky ballets,1257984000,"11 12, 2009",2009,1755,"['Finding', 'decent', 'production', 'Stravinsky', 'first', 'ballet', 'Firebird', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'easy', 'Finding', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'notorious', 'ballet', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'du', 'Printemps', 'Rite', 'Spring', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'Thankfully', 'DVD', 'great', '20th', 'century', 'works', 'performed', 'energetically', 'Mariinsky', 'Orchestra', 'Ballet', 'baton', 'great', 'Russian', 'conductor', 'Valery', 'Gergiev.CD', 'recordings', 'works', 'conducted', 'Gergiev', 'have', 'received', 'positive', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'great', 'care', 'went', 'researching', 'trying', 'reconstruct', 'original', 'choreography', 'faithful', 'reproduction', 'works', 'are', 'primarily', 'responsibility', 'dance', 'historian', 'Kenneth', 'Archer', 'Millicent', 'Hodson', 'took', 'great', 'care', 'presenting', 'ballets', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'seen', '1910', 'scandalously', '1913', 'when', 'debut', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'du', 'Printemps', 'caused', 'riot', 'when', 'appeared', 'Theatre', 'Champs-Elysees.Fans', 'ballet', 'contemporary', 'dance', 'should', 'not', 'hesitate', 'picking', 'up', 'DVD', 'performances', 'were', 'filmed', 'HD', 'many', 'camera', 'angles', 'including', 'aerial', 'are', 'used', 'show', 'work', 'went', 'staging', 'great', 'ballets', 'Extras', 'include', 'interview', 'Archer', 'Hodson', 'rehearsal', 'sequences', 'historical', 'information', 'Stravinsky', 'dancer', 'Vaslav', 'Nijinsky', 'impresario', 'Serge', 'Diaghilev', 'DVD', 'released', 'time', 'celebrate', '100th', 'anniversary', 'Ballet', 'Russes.Igor', 'Stravinsky', 'Rite', 'Spring', '/', 'Alexander', 'Scriabin', 'Poem', 'Ecstasy', 'Valery', 'Gergiev', '/', 'Kirov', 'OrchestraIgor', 'Stravinsky', 'Firebird', 'Complete', 'Ballet', '1910', '/', 'Alexander', 'Scriabin', 'Prometheus', 'Poem', 'Fire', 'Valery', 'Gergiev', '/', 'Kirov', 'Orchestra', 'St.', 'Petersburg', '/', 'Alexander', 'Toradze']",Stravinsky and the Ballets Russes: The Firebird/Le Sacre du Printemps
1249088,ANCPT9G4L1JZS,B0023T9ZR0,"Paul S. Rottenberg ""stevenrothbardt""","[11, 11]","One of the most interesting and striking aspects about these excellent productions by the Mariinsky Theatre of two of Stravinsky's most famous ballets is the elegance of the dancing.  Just compare the Russian company's performance of LE SACRE with that of the Joffrey Ballet (available on YOUTUBE in a watchable transcription of the original NPR broadcast, part of its ""Dance in America"" series), and you'll be immediately struck by the more secure technique of the Mariinsky dancers as opposed to that of the somewhat faster, more percussive and angular(emphasizing sharp angles) performance by the Joffrey. I found the Joffrey somewhat detached and slightly mechanical in their rendering of Part 1, and not as effective as the newer Russian version reviewed here. However, it's definetly worth comparing these two versions in Part 2, since the Joffrey's Young Girls are very effective in their parts, and Beatriz Rodriguez as The Chosen One is really outstanding in the Sacraficial Dance, showing palpable fear as well as generating real excitement. In contrast, Alexandra Iosifidi, the Mariinsky's Chosen One, is perhaps a bit less convincing, not showing as much emotion, but still very, very good. But overall, this new Mariinsky production is far superior in all the important areas, including their greater fluidity and elegance of performance, undoubtedly because this reproduction of Nijinsky's original choreography has been available for about twenty years by now, and because Valery Giergiev is a great conductor who generates more excitement in this live performance. (The Joffrey seems to be in a studio).The FIREBIRD is given an equally splendid performance, with interesting differences in contrast to the studio performance seen on Decca's wonderful ""Return of the Firebird,"" which includes equally fine productions of ""Petrushka"" and Diagelev's ballet based on ""Scheherazade.""  If you have a copy of that DVD and this new Mariinsky DVD, you'll be able to treat yourself to a profound experience of the evolution of some of the greatest ballets ever created because you'll realize that Stravinsky wrote the music of his first three ballets to be danced to, and that specific parts of the music correspond to specific parts of a story.  You'll never listen to the music in the same way after you see what it was created for.",5,Elegance in The Firebird and The Rite,1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,2340,"['One', 'most', 'interesting', 'striking', 'aspects', 'excellent', 'productions', 'Mariinsky', 'Theatre', 'two', 'Stravinsky', 'most', 'famous', 'ballets', 'elegance', 'dancing', 'Just', 'compare', 'Russian', 'company', 'performance', 'LE', 'SACRE', 'Joffrey', 'Ballet', 'available', 'YOUTUBE', 'watchable', 'transcription', 'original', 'NPR', 'broadcast', 'part', 'Dance', 'America', 'series', ""'ll"", 'be', 'immediately', 'struck', 'more', 'secure', 'technique', 'Mariinsky', 'dancers', 'opposed', 'somewhat', 'faster', 'more', 'percussive', 'angular', 'emphasizing', 'sharp', 'angles', 'performance', 'Joffrey', 'found', 'Joffrey', 'somewhat', 'detached', 'slightly', 'mechanical', 'rendering', 'Part', '1', 'not', 'as', 'effective', 'newer', 'Russian', 'version', 'reviewed', 'here', 'However', 'definetly', 'worth', 'comparing', 'two', 'versions', 'Part', '2', 'Joffrey', 'Young', 'Girls', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'parts', 'Beatriz', 'Rodriguez', 'Chosen', 'One', 'really', 'outstanding', 'Sacraficial', 'Dance', 'showing', 'palpable', 'fear', 'as', 'well', 'generating', 'real', 'excitement', 'contrast', 'Alexandra', 'Iosifidi', 'Mariinsky', 'Chosen', 'One', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'less', 'convincing', 'not', 'showing', 'much', 'emotion', 'still', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'new', 'Mariinsky', 'production', 'far', 'superior', 'important', 'areas', 'including', 'greater', 'fluidity', 'elegance', 'performance', 'undoubtedly', 'reproduction', 'Nijinsky', 'original', 'choreography', 'been', 'available', 'twenty', 'years', 'now', 'Valery', 'Giergiev', 'great', 'conductor', 'who', 'more', 'excitement', 'live', 'performance', 'Joffrey', 'be', 'studio', '.The', 'FIREBIRD', 'given', 'equally', 'splendid', 'performance', 'interesting', 'differences', 'contrast', 'studio', 'performance', 'seen', 'Decca', 'wonderful', 'Return', 'Firebird', 'equally', 'fine', 'productions', 'Petrushka', 'Diagelev', 'ballet', 'based', 'Scheherazade', 'have', 'copy', 'DVD', 'new', 'Mariinsky', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'treat', 'profound', 'experience', 'evolution', 'greatest', 'ballets', 'ever', 'created', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'Stravinsky', 'wrote', 'music', 'first', 'three', 'ballets', 'be', 'danced', 'specific', 'parts', 'music', 'correspond', 'specific', 'parts', 'story', ""'ll"", 'never', 'listen', 'music', 'same', 'way', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'created']",Stravinsky and the Ballets Russes: The Firebird/Le Sacre du Printemps
1249089,A381RJNYVOFYNI,B0023T9ZR0,"Rex B. Faubion ""Curious Reader""","[5, 5]","It seems to me these choreographic re-creations of the original Stravinsky ballets are about as close as we're going to get to what the Parisian audiences saw at their premieres.  ""Firebird"" here clears up for me what a lot of the music (especially in the Kashchei scenes) was designed to fit to the pantomime.  Fokine's choreography all seems a bit tame now, certainly when compared to some contemporary productions; the final scene strikes me as almost ludicrously sedate.  Most interesting to me is the attempt at reproducing Nijinsky's ""Rite of Spring""; I can see why the audience rebelled: not at the music (a huge success a few weeks later when performed as a purely musical item at a symphony concert), but at the dance elements.  After Nijinsky's scandalous success in ""Afternoon of a Faun,"" Diaghilev gave Nijinsky free-rein to choreograph ""Rite"" and what a shock for the audience (looking for athletic young bodies in form-fitting costumes performing leaps and lifts and exuberant acrobatics) to see the dancers clothed in formless ""Indian-squaw"" outfits, heads down, pounding out rhythms on the floor.  That might be anthropologically interesting to a scholarly audience today, but the Parisian audience was outraged.  My reaction, if this reproduction is in any way authentic, makes me feel that Nijinsky was not a talented choreographer; the ballet here seems quite a muddle.  But what a lovely scandal!  Thanks to Valery Gergiev and his team for the research and skill, along with the time and effort, to give us a chance to see what these famous ballets probably looked like in their original form.",5,Looking Back,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,1613,"['choreographic', 're-creations', 'original', 'Stravinsky', 'ballets', 'are', 'as', 'close', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'what', 'Parisian', 'audiences', 'saw', 'premieres', 'Firebird', 'here', 'up', 'what', 'lot', 'music', 'especially', 'Kashchei', 'scenes', 'was', 'designed', 'fit', 'pantomime', 'Fokine', 'choreography', 'all', 'bit', 'tame', 'now', 'certainly', 'when', 'compared', 'contemporary', 'productions', 'final', 'scene', 'strikes', 'almost', 'ludicrously', 'sedate', 'Most', 'interesting', 'attempt', 'reproducing', 'Nijinsky', 'Rite', 'Spring', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'audience', 'rebelled', 'not', 'music', 'huge', 'success', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'when', 'performed', 'purely', 'musical', 'item', 'symphony', 'concert', 'dance', 'elements', 'Nijinsky', 'scandalous', 'success', 'Afternoon', 'Faun', 'Diaghilev', 'gave', 'Nijinsky', 'free-rein', 'choreograph', 'Rite', 'what', 'shock', 'audience', 'looking', 'athletic', 'young', 'bodies', 'form-fitting', 'costumes', 'performing', 'leaps', 'lifts', 'exuberant', 'acrobatics', 'see', 'dancers', 'clothed', 'formless', 'Indian-squaw', 'outfits', 'heads', 'down', 'pounding', 'out', 'rhythms', 'floor', 'might', 'be', 'anthropologically', 'interesting', 'scholarly', 'audience', 'today', 'Parisian', 'audience', 'was', 'outraged', 'reaction', 'reproduction', 'way', 'authentic', 'feel', 'Nijinsky', 'was', 'not', 'talented', 'choreographer', 'ballet', 'here', 'quite', 'muddle', 'what', 'lovely', 'scandal', 'Thanks', 'Valery', 'Gergiev', 'team', 'research', 'skill', 'time', 'effort', 'give', 'chance', 'see', 'what', 'famous', 'ballets', 'probably', 'looked', 'original', 'form']",Stravinsky and the Ballets Russes: The Firebird/Le Sacre du Printemps

The art lovers who came to the theater and were greeted by totally unrecognizable cultural vocabulary were understandably shocked.In fact such an audience is far superior to the ones the art world gets today who are so unschooled that it is politically correct (and demanded) to approve of anything sent their way. So you have, for instance, museum goers oohing and ahhing over a dead shark in a tank of formaldehyde. The turn of the century art lovers might have had too little imagination to appreciate what they watched, but they had the neccessary education and taste to appreciate most of what they saw.At the same time, to watch the Rites as presented here is to see Stravinsky's genius and originality. For The Rites is beautiful, and while it requires a fresh look at the vocabulary of dance different from what was the standard of 1912, it is rewarding.It would be useful to read one of the numerous books on The Rites of Spring in order to enjoy the performance. I recommend Modris Ekstein's The Rites of Spring which covers the rise of modernism from The Rites of Spring through the end of World War I. Although the book does not spend a lot of time on the performance itself, it fits The Rites firmly into its time and place and shows just how revolutionary it was.I'm encouraged by some of the less flattering reviews here from people who have a more refined knowledge of dance than I do. It shows that there is still a cadre of art lovers who have taste and standards. However, for someone like me, who loves dance in all its forms but lacks the background to be truly discriminating, I can assure you that whatever the flaws in the performance here, they are invisible to most people.Since this is likely the only quality performance of The Rites of Spring we'll get for a long time, and the only historically accurate version we'll get for an even longer time, this is the one to see",5,Historically Accurate Recreation of a Revolutionary Moment in Art,1302480000,"04 11, 2011",2011,2102,"['Perhaps', 'best', 'aspect', 'high', 'quality', 'historically', 'accurate', 'production', 'Rites', 'Spring', 'understand', 'anger', 'audience', 'genius', 'Stravinsky', 'art', 'lovers', 'who', 'came', 'theater', 'were', 'greeted', 'totally', 'unrecognizable', 'cultural', 'vocabulary', 'were', 'understandably', 'shocked.In', 'fact', 'audience', 'far', 'superior', 'ones', 'art', 'world', 'today', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'unschooled', 'politically', 'correct', 'demanded', 'approve', 'anything', 'sent', 'way', 'have', 'instance', 'museum', 'goers', 'oohing', 'ahhing', 'over', 'dead', 'shark', 'tank', 'formaldehyde', 'turn', 'century', 'art', 'lovers', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'too', 'little', 'imagination', 'appreciate', 'what', 'watched', 'had', 'neccessary', 'education', 'taste', 'appreciate', 'most', 'what', 'saw.At', 'same', 'time', 'watch', 'Rites', 'presented', 'here', 'see', 'Stravinsky', 'genius', 'originality', 'Rites', 'beautiful', 'fresh', 'look', 'vocabulary', 'dance', 'different', 'what', 'was', 'standard', '1912', 'rewarding.It', 'would', 'be', 'useful', 'read', 'one', 'numerous', 'books', 'Rites', 'Spring', 'order', 'enjoy', 'performance', 'recommend', 'Modris', 'Ekstein', 'Rites', 'Spring', 'rise', 'modernism', 'Rites', 'Spring', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'book', 'not', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'performance', 'Rites', 'firmly', 'time', 'place', 'just', 'how', 'revolutionary', ""'m"", 'encouraged', 'less', 'flattering', 'reviews', 'here', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'more', 'refined', 'knowledge', 'dance', 'do', 'still', 'cadre', 'art', 'lovers', 'who', 'have', 'taste', 'standards', 'However', 'someone', 'who', 'dance', 'forms', 'background', 'be', 'truly', 'discriminating', 'can', 'assure', 'flaws', 'performance', 'here', 'are', 'invisible', 'most', 'people.Since', 'likely', 'only', 'quality', 'performance', 'Rites', 'Spring', ""'ll"", 'get', 'long', 'time', 'only', 'historically', 'accurate', 'version', ""'ll"", 'get', 'even', 'longer', 'time', 'one', 'see']",Stravinsky and the Ballets Russes: The Firebird/Le Sacre du Printemps

The lighting director actually knew what the hell he was doing. 3. Photography was just short of excellent. 4. Color saturation was perfect, I did not have to adjust the color or tint at all. Perhaps the red that represented the Firebird could have been a little less intense.(This is just my preference). 5. The Prancipals were actually young and Hindsome.(LOL) 6. The Ballerinas uniformly young and pretty. (I have another version where the principals need plastic surgery). 7. I know nothing of dance but it all seemed very fluid and graceful in movement. Even the frenetic demonium dance was very well done.  8. Kondaurova was surprising in her long leaps. Ananiashvili performs long leaps also in her version of the Firebird. Amazing. Perhaps the Firebird could have been a little more desperate to escape.(again, just my preference). 9. Gergiev conducted and elicited an exciting score. I don't actually know his work (or anything about music for that matter) but I liked this. 10. This ballet is based on an old Russian folk tale they say. I saw it as an allegory for the Adam and Eve story. The Firebird could be seen as Archangel Michael. When you steal ""Apples"" from the ""Tree"" in the ""Garden"" demons will come after you. Two audio tracks, Stereo and 3/2.1. Includes pracitice sessions as extras.This is well worth owning and is now my favorite of the three versions I own. I won't comment on Le Sacre du Printemps. I have a thing about representing native peoples as pagans by people who are often less genteel themselves.",4,WOW WOW WOW,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,1643,"['review', 'DVD', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'Let', 'try', '1', 'transfer', 'better', '99', '%', 'Blu', 'Rays', '2', 'lighting', 'director', 'actually', 'knew', 'what', 'hell', 'was', 'doing', '3', 'Photography', 'was', 'just', 'short', 'excellent', '4', 'Color', 'saturation', 'was', 'perfect', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'adjust', 'color', 'tint', 'Perhaps', 'red', 'represented', 'Firebird', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'less', 'intense', 'just', 'preference', '5', 'Prancipals', 'were', 'actually', 'young', 'Hindsome', 'LOL', '6', 'Ballerinas', 'uniformly', 'young', 'pretty', 'have', 'version', 'where', 'principals', 'need', 'plastic', 'surgery', '7', 'know', 'nothing', 'dance', 'seemed', 'very', 'fluid', 'graceful', 'movement', 'Even', 'frenetic', 'demonium', 'dance', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', '8', 'Kondaurova', 'was', 'surprising', 'long', 'leaps', 'Ananiashvili', 'performs', 'long', 'leaps', 'also', 'version', 'Firebird', 'Amazing', 'Perhaps', 'Firebird', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'desperate', 'escape', 'again', 'just', 'preference', '9', 'Gergiev', 'conducted', 'elicited', 'exciting', 'score', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'know', 'work', 'anything', 'music', 'matter', 'liked', '10', 'ballet', 'based', 'old', 'Russian', 'folk', 'tale', 'say', 'saw', 'allegory', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'story', 'Firebird', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'Archangel', 'Michael', 'When', 'steal', 'Apples', 'Tree', 'Garden', 'demons', 'will', 'come', 'Two', 'audio', 'tracks', 'Stereo', '3/2.1', 'Includes', 'pracitice', 'sessions', 'extras.This', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'now', 'favorite', 'three', 'versions', 'own', 'wo', ""n't"", 'comment', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'du', 'Printemps', 'have', 'thing', 'representing', 'native', 'peoples', 'pagans', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'often', 'less', 'genteel']",Stravinsky and the Ballets Russes: The Firebird/Le Sacre du Printemps
1249094,A1DSOF0EK9G06C,B0023T9ZR0,Zarathustra,"[34, 35]","Young Russian composer Igor Stravinsky's first ballet The Firebird created a sensation in Paris when it was first presented in 1910 by Les Ballets Russes. The second of the trio, Petroushka, appeared the following year. The third,Le Sacre du Printemps, the most revolutionary ballet ever performed and almost impossible to dance because of its irregular rhythms, caused a riot at its premiere in 1913.Now it is possible to see what caused the uproar with the  recreation of the original performances of Firebird and Rite of Spring by the Mariinsky Orchestra and Ballet. Both outstanding performances are conducted by Valery Gergiev and are based on the original choreography by Michel Fokine for Firebird and Vaslav Nijinsky for Rite of Spring.There are several excellent performances on DVD of The Firebird and a few of The Rite of Spring, but this one is unique. It allows you to see  what the Paris audiences saw at the beginning of the last century. Both performances still look revolutionary today.
