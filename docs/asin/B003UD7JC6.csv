My wife and I got hooked immediately. We love the entire cast. Tom, Donnie, Bridget, Will and Len. Not one character can bring up negative thoughts. Ending each show with a Sunday family Dinner is a stroke of genius, (the capital D is intentional), Whether one grew up that way, or just dreamed of it, it works well. I hope it continues for ten seasons. We went thru the first three seasons non-stop, and have no negative thoughts.

1363941,A2YW1SOKOLNG2,B003UD7JC6,"Amazon Customer ""Movie Fan""","[0, 1]","Blue Bloods is a fairly good show based on the strength of it's fine cast.  I guess I have been spoiled by cable, but the show is a tad tame and the story andrealism suffers a bit for it.  However, it is a very good, family friendly show.  I find the plots a tad simplistic and formulaic, but I don't think that is the show's strength.  The strength is the family dynamic of the whole group.  The fact that every character in the show is related to each other is the show hook, and I think it works on this level.  It is a family drama of a family in law enforcement.  Tom Selleck is as good as he ever is, and brings a great gravitas to the show.  Donnie Walberg, the oldest son, is good, but formulaic cop who bends the rules.  What sets him apart is his relationship with his family, both his siblings and his wife and kids.  Bridget Moynihan plays the daughter who is the Assistant DA.  She gets shafted the worst with a lot of interesting story lines with her ending abruptly.  She always seems to be the support.  Even the regular supporting characters are good.  Nick Turturro plays an affable, but brilliant police trainer of Nick Ellis, the brother rookie.  My favorite character is Jennifer Esposito, not just because she is absolutely beautiful, but also her great supporting role as the partner to Donniw Walberg.  In the end, not necessarily the best cop show I've seen, but in the top ten.  It is hindered probably by standards and practices by CBS.  It falls very short of being real gritty or real, but I really do like the family story and that's what makes it above average.",4,Selleck is back!,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,1592,"['Blue', 'Bloods', 'fairly', 'good', 'show', 'based', 'strength', 'fine', 'cast', 'guess', 'have', 'been', 'spoiled', 'cable', 'show', 'tad', 'tame', 'story', 'andrealism', 'bit', 'However', 'very', 'good', 'family', 'friendly', 'show', 'find', 'plots', 'tad', 'simplistic', 'formulaic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'show', 'strength', 'strength', 'family', 'dynamic', 'whole', 'group', 'fact', 'character', 'show', 'related', 'other', 'show', 'hook', 'think', 'level', 'family', 'drama', 'family', 'law', 'enforcement', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'great', 'gravitas', 'show', 'Donnie', 'Walberg', 'oldest', 'son', 'good', 'formulaic', 'cop', 'who', 'rules', 'What', 'apart', 'relationship', 'family', 'siblings', 'wife', 'kids', 'Bridget', 'Moynihan', 'daughter', 'who', 'Assistant', 'DA', 'shafted', 'worst', 'lot', 'interesting', 'story', 'lines', 'ending', 'abruptly', 'always', 'be', 'support', 'Even', 'regular', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'Nick', 'Turturro', 'affable', 'brilliant', 'police', 'trainer', 'Nick', 'Ellis', 'brother', 'rookie', 'favorite', 'character', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'not', 'just', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'also', 'great', 'supporting', 'role', 'partner', 'Donniw', 'Walberg', 'end', 'not', 'necessarily', 'best', 'cop', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'top', 'ten', 'hindered', 'probably', 'standards', 'practices', 'CBS', 'very', 'short', 'being', 'real', 'gritty', 'real', 'really', 'do', 'family', 'story', 'what', 'above', 'average']",Blue Bloods: Season 1

Of course Tom Selleck as Frank Reagan, Police Commissioner is one of the most impressive characters of the show ! It is so great to see Nichholas Turturro on the tube again (NYPD Blue as Detective James Martinez) ! ! !  The Police Commissioner struggles with ethics and bad guys balanced with the police as well as the Mayor.  The first season Mayor was a flake, fortunately the second season has David Ramsey as Mayor Carter Poole - Outstanding character !  You might remember him from Dexter as Anton :)  Back to Season One.  I wasn't a real fan of Danny Reagan (Donnie Wahlberg) and maybe he still isn't  but he works the character and is sincerely believable and ultimately, that is what makes a show work for me. It can be difficult to has a family relationship woven into the fabric of a police drama but the Sunday dinners help create a strong bond with the family as well as connecting the family into the police drama plot line.  The grandfather, Henry Reagan (Len Cariou) retired Police Commissioner not only links his family into strong relationships but also contributes his expertise into the police drama.  This is one TV series that works well because of the combination of their characters.  Selleck and Walhberg can not stand alone here, however, they are well supported.

The gracefully aging Selleck is spot-on as a widowed father trying to help his kids and grandkids navigate life's challenges.A parallel theme is the mystery surrounding the missing Reagan, Frank's son Joe, a cop murdered on the job.  Early in the season, the FBI reaches out to Jamie to be an undercover source against the Blue Templar, a secret police society gone bad.

1363973,A3UQNIT3F07UIQ,B003UD7JC6,Eugene M. Roby,"[1, 2]","I am a big fan of COP/ Crime dramas. I have always enjoyed the Law and Order series' and NYPD Blue. Even though I have always enjoyed Poice Crime dramas I have always been upset by the ""graphic or cheesy"" dichotomy. It seems the family oriented dramas are a bit too ""PG rated"" to realistically portray the criminal activities in the plot. On the other side you have the gritty shows like ""The Shield"" and ""Sons of Anarchy"" who go out of the way to earn the ""TV MA"" rating. This show in my opinion, shoots pretty well down the middle. It is not too ""happy go lucky"" to be unbelievable, but not so gritty that your family (especially if you have younger kids) cannot enjoy it with you. I wouldn't want to watch Sons of Anarchy with my mother or my daughter, but this show would not offend the sensitivities of either.In the past years most COP/Procedural dramas have narrowly focused on various aspects of the Law enforcement community. We have the CIS/NCIS shows that focus mostly on the scientific forensics, we have Law and Order, which focuses on the Legal and investigative part, and we have had NYPD Blue, which focused on the ""Beat Cops"", and detectives, and some of the internal Police politics. This show in my opinion does a great job of wrapping all ofthese aspects in one show, using the ""Reagan Family Mechanism."" To clarify this, thse show focuses on one family, the Reagan Family, who are all involved with Law Enforcement in one way. The Patriarch Frank Reagan (played by Tom Selleck) is the acting Police Commisioner, his conflicts usually have to do with poltical conflicts between his office and various othe NY gov't offices and agencies. And occassionally focuses on his struggle to seperate his job as commisioner and father &lt;being that all his sons are NYPD officers. Frank Reagan's oldest son, Danny Reagan, plyaed by Donnie Wahlberg, is a hard nosed (""do whatever it takes to put the crooks away""), vetran detective in the NYPD. His conflicts usually surround his investigations, and various things he has to do to put the bad guys away. The fact that he takes his job so seriously sometimes causes conflict with his wife and kids. Ering Reagan, played by Bridget Moynahan, is the only daughter of Frank Reagan, and she is the Assistant District Attorney (ADA) of NYC. Her conflicts ussually involve cutting legal red tape and the like (Law and Order type stuff). In addition she is a recent divorce' and is raising here teenage daughter on her own. Jaime Reagan, played by Will Estes, is the youngest of the Reagan childern, and upon graduating from Harvard Law School, he decided to join the NYPD as a patrol officer. Being a rookie cop, when the series begins, a lot of his conflicts involve hime getting used to being a cop, and learning how to be a good one. He also struggles with living up to his potential, as a Harvard grad who is now working as a beat cop. In short this eries does a great job of presenting different views of the Law enforcement culture of New York, and even though it seems improbable that a Family would have people in such different but realted places in life, I think the mechaism works.I really enjoy the family dynamic and focus of this series. A lot of crime dramas put the procedural stuff in front of the character aspects of the series. This show does a good job of balancing both. Throughout the First Season you get to know the Reagan Family very well, it's kind of like a ""reverse- Sopranos.""The casting of this series was done quite well. With A list actors (Selleck) the well-known (Wahlberg, Moynaghan), and new faces (Estes), all the actors and characters interact well and give a great performance. The only week actor, in my opinion is the actress of Erin Reagan's daughter, Nicole Reagan-Bouyled (portrayed by Sami Gayle), who actually replaced the original actress of Nicole early on in season 1. Her performance seems strained, but is tolerable.This series, unlike other NYC based dramas like Seinfeld&lt; is actually filmed in NYC. It is really cool to see the beautiful views of NYC during transitions, and in the background of scenes. This really adds to the believability and realism of the show.Overall, I really like the fact that this show is compelling, entertaining, and appropriate for most ages. Being a family man, that is the biggest seling point to me.",5,A great COP/Family drama series that all can enjoy,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,4342,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'COP/', 'Crime', 'dramas', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Law', 'Order', 'series', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'Even', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Poice', 'Crime', 'dramas', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'upset', 'graphic', 'cheesy', 'dichotomy', 'family', 'oriented', 'dramas', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'PG', 'rated', 'realistically', 'portray', 'criminal', 'activities', 'plot', 'other', 'side', 'have', 'gritty', 'Shield', 'Sons', 'Anarchy', 'who', 'go', 'way', 'earn', 'TV', 'MA', 'rating', 'show', 'opinion', 'shoots', 'pretty', 'well', 'middle', 'not', 'too', 'happy', 'go', 'lucky', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'not', 'so', 'gritty', 'family', 'especially', 'have', 'younger', 'kids', 'can', 'not', 'enjoy', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'Sons', 'Anarchy', 'mother', 'daughter', 'show', 'would', 'not', 'offend', 'sensitivities', 'either.In', 'past', 'years', 'most', 'COP/Procedural', 'dramas', 'have', 'narrowly', 'focused', 'various', 'aspects', 'Law', 'enforcement', 'community', 'have', 'CIS/NCIS', 'focus', 'mostly', 'scientific', 'forensics', 'have', 'Law', 'Order', 'Legal', 'investigative', 'part', 'have', 'had', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'focused', 'Beat', 'Cops', 'detectives', 'internal', 'Police', 'politics', 'show', 'opinion', 'great', 'job', 'wrapping', 'ofthese', 'aspects', 'one', 'show', 'using', 'Reagan', 'Family', 'Mechanism', 'clarify', 'thse', 'show', 'one', 'family', 'Reagan', 'Family', 'who', 'are', 'involved', 'Law', 'Enforcement', 'one', 'way', 'Patriarch', 'Frank', 'Reagan', 'played', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'acting', 'Police', 'Commisioner', 'conflicts', 'usually', 'have', 'do', 'poltical', 'conflicts', 'office', 'various', 'othe', 'NY', ""gov't"", 'offices', 'agencies', 'occassionally', 'focuses', 'struggle', 'seperate', 'job', 'commisioner', 'father', 'lt', 'being', 'sons', 'are', 'NYPD', 'officers', 'Frank', 'Reagan', 'oldest', 'son', 'Danny', 'Reagan', 'plyaed', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'hard', 'nosed', 'do', 'whatever', 'put', 'crooks', 'away', 'vetran', 'detective', 'NYPD', 'conflicts', 'usually', 'surround', 'investigations', 'various', 'things', 'do', 'put', 'bad', 'guys', 'away', 'fact', 'job', 'so', 'seriously', 'sometimes', 'causes', 'conflict', 'wife', 'kids', 'Ering', 'Reagan', 'played', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'only', 'daughter', 'Frank', 'Reagan', 'Assistant', 'District', 'Attorney', 'ADA', 'NYC', 'conflicts', 'ussually', 'involve', 'cutting', 'legal', 'red', 'tape', 'like', 'Law', 'Order', 'type', 'stuff', 'addition', 'recent', 'divorce', 'raising', 'here', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'own', 'Jaime', 'Reagan', 'played', 'Will', 'Estes', 'youngest', 'Reagan', 'childern', 'graduating', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'decided', 'join', 'NYPD', 'patrol', 'officer', 'Being', 'rookie', 'cop', 'when', 'series', 'lot', 'conflicts', 'involve', 'hime', 'getting', 'used', 'being', 'cop', 'learning', 'how', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'also', 'living', 'up', 'potential', 'Harvard', 'grad', 'who', 'now', 'working', 'beat', 'cop', 'short', 'great', 'job', 'presenting', 'different', 'views', 'Law', 'enforcement', 'culture', 'New', 'York', 'even', 'improbable', 'Family', 'would', 'have', 'people', 'such', 'different', 'realted', 'places', 'life', 'think', 'mechaism', 'really', 'enjoy', 'family', 'dynamic', 'focus', 'series', 'lot', 'crime', 'dramas', 'put', 'procedural', 'stuff', 'front', 'character', 'aspects', 'series', 'show', 'good', 'job', 'balancing', 'First', 'Season', 'get', 'know', 'Reagan', 'Family', 'very', 'well', 'kind', 'reverse-', 'Sopranos', 'casting', 'series', 'was', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'list', 'actors', 'Selleck', 'well-known', 'Wahlberg', 'Moynaghan', 'new', 'Estes', 'actors', 'characters', 'interact', 'well', 'give', 'great', 'performance', 'only', 'week', 'actor', 'opinion', 'actress', 'Erin', 'Reagan', 'daughter', 'Nicole', 'Reagan-Bouyled', 'portrayed', 'Sami', 'Gayle', 'who', 'actually', 'replaced', 'original', 'actress', 'Nicole', 'early', 'season', '1', 'performance', 'strained', 'tolerable.This', 'series', 'other', 'NYC', 'based', 'dramas', 'Seinfeld', 'lt', 'actually', 'filmed', 'NYC', 'really', 'cool', 'see', 'beautiful', 'views', 'NYC', 'transitions', 'background', 'scenes', 'really', 'believability', 'realism', 'show.Overall', 'really', 'fact', 'show', 'compelling', 'entertaining', 'appropriate', 'most', 'ages', 'Being', 'family', 'man', 'biggest', 'seling', 'point']",Blue Bloods: Season 1

It looked stronger than other series coming out of the starting gate, incorporating elements of Charles Bronson's Family Of Cops as well as Hill Street Blues, one of the best police series ever. The dialogue and acting will become more natural as the cast and crew gain experience. Some of the police work is absurdly miraculous. One senses that the original scripts called for a couple hours per episode, and someone gave the order to snip them down to twenty minutes, thus robbing stories of smoother development. This feeling is particularly strong in an episode that pays tribute to officers affected by the tragedies that occurred on 911.I like the inter-generational aspect that touches on issues pertaining to the changing nature of police work.

Since the original Law & Order ended, it's probably the best drama series now on TV in the U.S.  While perhaps the scripts do stretch it a bit when they involve every adult member of the family in a crime, they are never the less intelligently written.  Each episode is fast paced, without the over reliance on car chases, as so many crime drama do.  The producers were wise to insist on filming the show entirely in New York.  The city deserves star billing.  You just can't replicate the atmosphere if you try to film an NYC-based show in Toronto or a studio back lot in Hollywood.  Best of all, is the Blue Bloods cast.

1364007,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003UD7JC6,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","Television series have stayed with tried and true genres for years. At one time the three main genres were doctor series, westerns and police stories. Westerns have yet to return, doctor series have begun to peter out with ER but police stories are in full swing, at least for detective series. Now the everyday policeman, the man in blue, has a turn next to the detectives in BLUE BLOODS, season one of which has just been released on DVD.The story revolves around a family that has three generations involved in the New York police department. The main focus revolves around Frank Regan (Tom Selleck) the current police commissioner. Having served under his father Hank (Lou Cariou) who held the same rank, Frank does his best to handle the pressures of the man on the street and those in political office who seem more interested in their careers than catching criminals or protecting people.The same family has spawned Danny Reagan (Donnie Wahlberg), a tough as nails detective who's willing to do anything, step over nearly any line, to make sure that people are safe and that criminals are punished. His dedication to people's safety inevitably places him before a review board defending the actions he used, mostly violent ones, to coerce criminals to give him information. Danny is the hot head, the cop who works from his gut instead of his head.This brings us to Erin Reagan-Boyle (Bridget Moynihan), the daughter who became a prosecutor and assistant district attorney. Erin believes in bringing criminals to trial, in putting them behind bars and in doing things legally so they can be held accountable for their actions. She is the brains behind the brawn, who loves her brother but can see the bigger picture.Rounding out the family is Jamie Reagan (Will Estes), the youngest brother who went to Harvard and graduated but who turned his back on a lawyers life to dress in blue and police the streets. Jamie is a new recruit and graduate of the police academy as the series opens.Each week we witness separate crimes that on occasion blend into one another, each involving different aspects of how these characters take care of the streets of New York. They try to stay apart from one another for fear of prejudicing a jury, but each one helps the other whenever possible. There is one thread among them that plays out from start to finish and that's their missing brother.It seems he was killed in the line of duty and on occasion these characters will refer back to him, but none as much as Jamie. Just out of the academy and on the streets, he is approached one night by a government agency that wants his help. A secret society of New York police called the Blue Templar is dishing out vigilante justice and they're trying to stop it. So was Jamie's deceased brother. They play a portion of a recording he made just prior to his death which leads them to believe he was killed not in the line of duty but by the Blue Templar. And now Jamie must decide whether to join their hunt for this vigilante group or take it to his family.The series is quite well made, with some stunning visuals and photography that brings the best and the worst the New York has to offer. The acting is such that you don't think while watching that these are actors, you believe them in each role they offer. Selleck is a stand out, a far cry from both his turn as Magnum P.I. where he was comedic and action oriented and from Jesse Stone in the series of movies he's starred in where he's quiet at all times. Frank Reagan is a man not to be messed with, a man who will protect his family and his city at all costs, politics be damned.The nice thing about being able to watch season one on DVD is what I've said all along. If you missed the series from the start or were watching another at that time, you now have the chance to go back and start from the beginning. And with season two about to begin, what better chance than now to pick this one up and jump on the bandwagon?

1364027,A49DXD4WVLSLL,B003UD7JC6,Paul Brooks,"[0, 0]","Blue Bloods - The First Season  [496 2014-01-22]Summary:The location is contemporary New York City and the theme is a police procedural from a unique prospective. The shows focus around the Regan family: Frank (Tom Selleck) is the Police Commissioner; his oldest son Danny (Danny Wahlberg) a hotshot detective; another son Jamie is Harvard educated but by choice a rookie cop; daughter Erin is an assistant D.A. and Henry - Frank's father, a former NYC Police Commissioner.Content:The Season One package consists of 6 disks and 22 episodes originally show on CBS during the period September 2010 through May 2011. Also included are several special features on disk 6 that I founding modestly interesting but somewhat redundant.Positive Comments: Many episodes include deleted scenes, which are not to be missed. Some are quite lengthy and are interesting and informative concerning that particular episode. Season One developed a reoccurring theme of a secret society of rogue cops called the Blue Templars. Although more of a background story issue it was resolved during the climatic final season one episode. I greatly admire the Regan family. They ague, rage against one another sometimes, but all are pulling the wagon in the same direction. It was refreshing to see a show with an honest focus on genuine family values even with members who are contrary and strongly opinionated. I enjoyed the New York City local for these episodes. In fact the city is a major character in this series in my estimation.The Cast:Tom Selleck and Danny Wahlberg are terrific in their roles. Other cast members are very good - I particularly admire Danny Regan's female detective partner (Jennifer Esposito).Negative Comments: After a season long build up the climatic episode with the Blue Templars was a disappointed. Instead of a super secret group of cagey operatives they were portrayed as just a bunch of greedy thugs. Several episodes featured a politically ambitious district attorney who expressed a romantic interest in Commissioner Reagan's daughter Erin, an assistant D.A. He just disappeared from the show with no explanations. We were not told he quit or was replaced he just ""vanished"" without a trace although he was still Erin Regan's boss.Recommendations:This is a highly recommend show that keep my interest.

Having been spoilt by those shows and must wait a few years for a series which matches the heights set by them. Sadly Blue Bloods does not even attempt to reach their standard and shows nothing we have not seen many times before and has been done better by the shows like 'Kojak', 'Cagney and Lacey' and 'The Streets of San Francisco.'The hook in this show is that we have a family of cops and a DA, but this is not new, remember 'A Family of Cops' with Charles Bronson and even ' Macmillan and Wife' I notice that Tom Sellick has been praised by other reviewers for his performance. That's fine if you enjoy his performance as a plank of wood, and none of the other featured performers can make up for the star's lack of emotion.We can only hope that we will not have to wait to long for a cop show which builds on the standards set by 'the Wire' and 'The Shield' just 'The Wire' built on 'Homicide Life on the Streets' and 'NYPD Blue' built 'Hill Street Blues' rather than revert like 'Blue Bloods to a sad and tired old formula.If you want to see a cop drama that pushes the boundaries I suggest the Swedish series 'Wallander' or the French series 'Spiral' both are better than any current American or British cop show.",2,Seen it to many times before,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,1299,"['may', 'be', 'US', 'cop', 'shows', 'reached', 'peak', ""'The"", 'Wire', ""'The"", 'Shield', 'Having', 'been', 'spoilt', 'shows', 'must', 'wait', 'few', 'years', 'series', 'heights', 'set', 'Sadly', 'Blue', 'Bloods', 'not', 'even', 'attempt', 'reach', 'standard', 'nothing', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'shows', ""'Kojak"", ""'Cagney"", 'Lacey', ""'The"", 'Streets', 'San', 'Francisco', 'hook', 'show', 'have', 'family', 'cops', 'DA', 'not', 'new', 'remember', 'Family', 'Cops', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'even', 'Macmillan', 'Wife', 'notice', 'Tom', 'Sellick', 'been', 'praised', 'other', 'reviewers', 'performance', 'fine', 'enjoy', 'performance', 'plank', 'wood', 'none', 'other', 'featured', 'performers', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'star', 'lack', 'emotion.We', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'wait', 'long', 'cop', 'show', 'standards', 'set', ""'the"", 'Wire', ""'The"", 'Shield', 'just', ""'The"", 'Wire', 'built', ""'Homicide"", 'Life', 'Streets', ""'NYPD"", 'Blue', 'built', ""'Hill"", 'Street', 'Blues', 'rather', 'revert', 'Bloods', 'sad', 'tired', 'old', 'formula.If', 'want', 'see', 'cop', 'drama', 'boundaries', 'suggest', 'Swedish', 'series', ""'Wallander"", 'French', 'series', ""'Spiral"", 'are', 'better', 'current', 'American', 'British', 'cop', 'show']",Blue Bloods: Season 1
