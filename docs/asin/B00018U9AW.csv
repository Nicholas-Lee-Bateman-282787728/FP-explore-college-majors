The dogs and the dog-lovers were slightly less annoying, so perhaps I could give this cute little program three stars anyway.The topic? The evolution of dogs from wolves, various gene-related discussions, and an interview with a Berkeley geneticist who reluctantly allows his family to get a dog! The experimental farm in Siberia, where a team of Russian scientists have domesticated foxes to the point of making them look like dogs, is also featured. Meanwhile, a group of U.S. scientists are trying to domesticate wolves, with little success. I suppose this gives new meaning to the expression ""barking mad""...Otherwise, ""Dogs and more dogs"" features papillons, salukis, huskies, border collies and (I think) Pyr pups. And, as I said, animated comics.",3,"Dogs, more dogs and animated dogs",1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,875,"['across', 'documentary', 'children', 'lot', 'funny', 'animated', 'stuff', 'admit', 'annoyed', 'somewhat', 'dogs', 'dog-lovers', 'were', 'slightly', 'less', 'annoying', 'perhaps', 'could', 'give', 'cute', 'little', 'program', 'three', 'topic', 'evolution', 'dogs', 'wolves', 'various', 'gene-related', 'discussions', 'interview', 'Berkeley', 'geneticist', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'family', 'get', 'dog', 'experimental', 'farm', 'Siberia', 'where', 'team', 'Russian', 'scientists', 'have', 'domesticated', 'foxes', 'point', 'making', 'look', 'dogs', 'also', 'featured', 'Meanwhile', 'group', 'U.S.', 'scientists', 'are', 'trying', 'domesticate', 'wolves', 'little', 'success', 'suppose', 'new', 'meaning', 'expression', 'barking', 'mad', 'Otherwise', 'Dogs', 'more', 'dogs', 'features', 'papillons', 'salukis', 'huskies', 'border', 'collies', 'think', 'Pyr', 'pups', 'said', 'animated', 'comics']",N/A

I could have done without the cartoons, but that's a quibble.  It was interesting to hear about some theories and research, though not in-depth.  John Lithgow narrates smoothly.  I'd have preferred more video of dogs and less of people talking, but it was fun anyway.",4,"Interesting, made me smile",1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,361,"['program', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'children', 'assuming', 'animals', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'cartoons', 'quibble', 'was', 'interesting', 'hear', 'theories', 'research', 'not', 'in-depth', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'smoothly', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'video', 'dogs', 'less', 'people', 'talking', 'was', 'fun', 'anyway']",N/A

795563,AGOTLW0YFPWSW,B00018U9AW,transponder,"[7, 16]","This program starts out cheerfully enough and develops well, discussing the origins of the domestic dog and so on.  But then it dives into a mess of moralizing about the fact of distinct breeds, misrepresenting the meaning and purpose of breeds, and the breeders who maintain them, as somehow ""racist.""  Ludicrous as this is, the attempt to make breeds seem sinister ruined the program for my family.  One breeder of Papillons is interviewed, which does not help matters since she--and the supposed experts brought onto the program--neglect to discuss the role of temperament or disposition in dog breeds, i.e. that dogs are bred for much more than looks.  There are some risks or difficulties with maintaining breeds, but responsible breeders are well aware of them.  To make it seem that only mixed breeds (and mutts) are moral is to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  Did the producers of this program ever watch a serious dog show such as Crufts or Westminster?  If they had, they would have had a much better idea of what modern dogs and their breeders/owners are all about.
