1310204,AHL35XZ3OND2Z,B002ZG993Q,Adron Gardner,"[0, 1]","I just finished this movie and I can't remember about 80 of the 90 minutes of it.  And even then, the ten minutes I do recall have mostly to do with how impeccably impeccable everybody's hair is.It's soooo serious.  The dialog soooo short.  Every camera shot is not just wide, it's soooo wide.  The girls all soooo alike.  And the movie, by result, is soooo boring.  But he's a killer and the corridors are green at night, soooo it has to be interesting, right?George Clooney is a great deal more unbelievable in his seemingly twilight years take on Tom Cruise's assassin from Collateral.  It feels as if Clooney is approaching this role as some off broadway workshop.  He isn't ""reserved,""  no he is completely nonexistent.  Clooney made his name playing the likeable middle aged working stiff.  The ladies man at night, but busting his butt for a dime.  Don't mistake that for thinking he has ""disappeared"" in his role - he is completely forgettable, moving from one strangely out place sex scene to the next.  He must have been watching a lot of Michael Mann when he took this one - because if he isn't trying to ape Cruise, he's mirroring, to the best of his meager ability, de Niro's dance in Mann's Heat. Only in Syriana did George stretch his limits, and even then appropriately so.But I'm being kind here.  Most of the blame for this goes to Corbijn.  If Clooney is anonymous on the call sheet, the director is MIA.Anton Corbijn's celebrity photography have done him no favors here.  Why would they? Most of his portraiture lacked any real connection and this movie, he shows no interest, connection or insight into any character in the frame.  But hey, they spent hours getting the gel balance right on all those night corridors.  Though he directed a movie named Control - he obviously had none during the filming of this movie.  It feels as if all the calls were from Clooney from beginning to end.  Corbijn may have some photographic vision, but he has no perception on what it takes to guide a story in motion.At least he used a Hasselblad for his still work.",2,Vapid by any definition,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,2072,"['just', 'finished', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', '80', '90', 'minutes', 'even', 'then', 'ten', 'minutes', 'do', 'have', 'mostly', 'do', 'how', 'impeccably', 'impeccable', 'everybody', 'hair', 'is.It', 'soooo', 'serious', 'dialog', 'soooo', 'short', 'camera', 'shot', 'not', 'just', 'wide', 'soooo', 'wide', 'girls', 'soooo', 'alike', 'movie', 'result', 'soooo', 'boring', 'killer', 'corridors', 'are', 'green', 'night', 'soooo', 'be', 'interesting', 'right', 'George', 'Clooney', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'seemingly', 'twilight', 'years', 'take', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'assassin', 'Collateral', 'Clooney', 'approaching', 'role', 'broadway', 'workshop', ""n't"", 'reserved', 'completely', 'nonexistent', 'Clooney', 'made', 'name', 'playing', 'likeable', 'middle', 'aged', 'working', 'stiff', 'ladies', 'man', 'night', 'busting', 'butt', 'dime', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'thinking', 'disappeared', 'role', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'moving', 'one', 'strangely', 'place', 'sex', 'scene', 'next', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'lot', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'when', 'took', 'one', ""n't"", 'trying', 'ape', 'Cruise', 'mirroring', 'best', 'meager', 'ability', 'Niro', 'dance', 'Mann', 'Heat', 'Only', 'Syriana', 'did', 'George', 'stretch', 'limits', 'even', 'then', 'appropriately', 'so.But', ""'m"", 'being', 'kind', 'here', 'Most', 'blame', 'Corbijn', 'Clooney', 'anonymous', 'call', 'sheet', 'director', 'MIA.Anton', 'Corbijn', 'celebrity', 'photography', 'have', 'done', 'favors', 'here', 'Why', 'would', 'Most', 'portraiture', 'lacked', 'real', 'connection', 'movie', 'interest', 'connection', 'insight', 'character', 'frame', 'hey', 'spent', 'hours', 'getting', 'gel', 'balance', 'right', 'night', 'corridors', 'directed', 'movie', 'named', 'Control', 'obviously', 'had', 'none', 'filming', 'movie', 'calls', 'were', 'Clooney', 'beginning', 'end', 'Corbijn', 'may', 'have', 'photographic', 'vision', 'perception', 'what', 'guide', 'story', 'motion.At', 'least', 'used', 'Hasselblad', 'still', 'work']",N/A

The camera work and acting were superb, and the scenery beautiful, but the pace was very slow.  The main problem was that the story was not plausible or compelling - very little actually happened, and what eventually transpired in the end made no sense.  Not even the development and interactions of those stylish and mysterious characters could make up for the pedestrian and meaningless plot.  (BTW, I dare you to try shipping an M-14 in a film tube to a place like that in Italy or set up a gunsmithing shop with loading dies, mercury, etc. by making one trip to an auto repair garage.)  Jack was a very lonely and troubled man, and George Clooney seemed to be very comfortable in that role.  The  makers of this film must have thought that the audience is supposed to develop an emotional connection with someone like Jack, a top-notch professional ""doing his job"", because of the following:  1. The assasination business is way cool;  2. Jack encountered new circumstances that resulted in his eventual transformation;  3.

This will certainly make you appreciate the true passion behind film aspects and the power of silence. I had seen this 3 or 4 times before buying it. It is one one of my all time favorite George Clooney films. There is very little speaking in this film, not many characters, and it ALMOST seems to drag on with a few things. I say almost, because it is necessary, for the films emotion, to draw out the way it does. You get to see so much emotion behind the things going on with the main character and what he is going through trying to get out of the business. I am rather disappointed that he dies in the end. I was rooting for him to get out and have a good life with his love interest. Plus, that would leave the door open for a sequel. Never the less, it is a truly BRILLIANT film.

1310210,A1SRI13D6GR0X8,B002ZG993Q,a Midwest reviewer,"[1, 3]","I really liked ""the American."" I wish Hollywood made at least a few more movies like this. The American"" is about suspense and uncertainty, beautiful scenery, love scenes, and all the personal and moral collateral damage that comes from living the life of an assassin.The typical Hollwood action hero is fast, loud, drives powerful cars, and draws lots of attention to themself. If there's any time for romance, the only real challenge is usually to clear the bad guys out of the way first so they can ride off into the sunset. If those who get killed even have a real personality and a face, Hollywood quickly provides convenient excuses for why the hero and you can feel justified to kill them. Who is a  bad guy and who you can trust and all the plotlines are neatly tied up by the end. Usually everything's a caricature - the backdrop either looks everything was all built in the last two years or else it's someone's stereotype of an urban ghetto. This is not that movie.""The American"" is a glimpse of what anyone who actually lived the secret agent lifestyle would miss out on in life. Here the hero can't be brash and damn-the-consequences - quite the opposite - his life totally depends on being quiet and staying out of the light. Boring you say? Well, your typical action hero who talks and acts like they can do anything wouldn't last more than two or three weeks as an assassin in the world of ""The American.""Unlike so many action/adventure movies, ""the American"" doesn't glamorize guns, technology, power, or violence. Here there are as many motor scooters and trains as there are fast sportscars. Not an indie film, but I would call it something of an anti-Hollywood film. If it doesn't neatly fit the standard categories for what you expect in a movie, I say that's a pretty good critique of the standard categories. Look through the list of movies on redbox, netflix or Blockbuster and count 'em up and tell me we really need one more mindless angry shoot-em-up movie just like all the others instead of one movie like ""the American.""Yeah, if you watch this movie expecting an adrenaline rush of shoot-em-up scenes and vengeance you'll probably be disappointed. You will find enouh movies in this category to watch a different one every day all year long. If on the other hand you'd really like to see something a little different from the stock formula Hollywood usually serves up, enjoy this as a rare treat.",5,Great movie - just don't expect typical Hollywood action flick,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,2426,"['really', 'liked', 'American', 'wish', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'least', 'few', 'more', 'movies', 'American', 'suspense', 'uncertainty', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'love', 'scenes', 'personal', 'moral', 'collateral', 'damage', 'living', 'life', 'assassin.The', 'typical', 'Hollwood', 'action', 'hero', 'fast', 'loud', 'powerful', 'cars', 'lots', 'attention', 'themself', 'time', 'romance', 'only', 'real', 'challenge', 'usually', 'clear', 'bad', 'guys', 'way', 'first', 'can', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'who', 'get', 'killed', 'even', 'have', 'real', 'personality', 'face', 'Hollywood', 'quickly', 'convenient', 'excuses', 'why', 'hero', 'can', 'feel', 'justified', 'kill', 'Who', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'trust', 'plotlines', 'are', 'neatly', 'tied', 'up', 'end', 'Usually', 'everything', 'caricature', 'backdrop', 'everything', 'was', 'built', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'else', 'someone', 'stereotype', 'urban', 'ghetto', 'not', 'movie', 'American', 'glimpse', 'what', 'anyone', 'who', 'actually', 'lived', 'secret', 'agent', 'lifestyle', 'would', 'miss', 'out', 'life', 'Here', 'hero', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'brash', 'damn-the-consequences', 'quite', 'opposite', 'life', 'totally', 'being', 'quiet', 'staying', 'light', 'Boring', 'say', 'Well', 'typical', 'action', 'hero', 'who', 'acts', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'would', ""n't"", 'last', 'more', 'two', 'three', 'weeks', 'assassin', 'world', 'American', 'so', 'many', 'action/adventure', 'movies', 'American', ""n't"", 'glamorize', 'guns', 'technology', 'power', 'violence', 'Here', 'are', 'many', 'motor', 'scooters', 'trains', 'are', 'fast', 'sportscars', 'Not', 'indie', 'film', 'would', 'call', 'something', 'anti-Hollywood', 'film', ""n't"", 'neatly', 'fit', 'standard', 'categories', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'say', 'pretty', 'good', 'critique', 'standard', 'categories', 'Look', 'list', 'movies', 'redbox', 'netflix', 'Blockbuster', 'count', ""'em"", 'up', 'tell', 'really', 'need', 'one', 'more', 'mindless', 'angry', 'shoot-em-up', 'movie', 'just', 'others', 'instead', 'one', 'movie', 'American', 'Yeah', 'watch', 'movie', 'expecting', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'shoot-em-up', 'scenes', 'vengeance', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'will', 'find', 'enouh', 'movies', 'category', 'watch', 'different', 'one', 'day', 'year', 'long', 'other', 'hand', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'see', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'stock', 'formula', 'Hollywood', 'usually', 'up', 'enjoy', 'rare', 'treat']",N/A
1310211,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG993Q,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","Truth be told, `The American' is nothing like I ever expected it to be.  The film is such a brooding and electrifying character study that works so well it shocked me.  I was expecting a more straight forward action thriller, and while the action is certainly there (the bookends are sublime), the film has far more depth than that.Expertly paced, thoughtful and dripping with suspense.The film takes place in Italy, where a hit-man named Jack is awaiting details on his `final' assignment.  He's done.  He wants out.  He wants to pursue a life filled with the attachments he is deprived while smothered within the restraints of his profession.  During his stay in Italy, Jack becomes acquainted with a high-class hooker named Clara.  Despite the fact that emotional ties are dangerous, Jack wants to be with her.  Instead of broaching this plot point in the clich&eacute;d and generic fashion, `The American' beautifully uses the camera to expose the inner emotional complexities within Jack.  His feelings for Clara are less `love at first sight' and more deep-seated in the emotional loss he's experienced over years of distancing himself from everyone around him.  As Jack's eventual `job' rears its head, his world starts to unravel as he discovers his professional life cannot coexist with his intimacies.George Clooney certainly delivers his best performance in years.  I've always preferred my Clooney comedic, but this finely tuned dramatic performance is outstanding; so layered and complex.  Violante Placido is a gem of an actress.  Not only is she beyond words gorgeous (OMG), she is certainly talented enough to go step for step with Clooney and demand out attention.  She is also mysterious enough to keep the audience guessing as to what her true intentions are.The real star of the show is director Anton Corbijn.  His film debut was 2007's `Control' (what a debut), and his sophomore effort shows that it was no fluke.  He really is extremely adept at creating natural tension with the lens and pacing his projects to exude a stylistic naturalism.  The way he uses his surroundings to produce such lasting imagery, physical and emotional, is outstanding.In the end I can't help but recommend this film.  It sits on you, dwells in your mind's eye and definitely makes quite an impact.  It is a quieter film than one may expect, but it is within those quiet moments that the film really unveils itself to the audience.  Tackling serious subjects such as self-doubt and spirituality; `The American' is a brilliant film about a man coming to terms with his own fate.",5,A different kind of experience...,1307404800,"06 7, 2011",2011,2580,"['Truth', 'be', 'told', 'American', 'nothing', 'ever', 'expected', 'be', 'film', 'brooding', 'electrifying', 'character', 'study', 'so', 'well', 'shocked', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'straight', 'forward', 'action', 'thriller', 'action', 'certainly', 'bookends', 'are', 'sublime', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'depth', 'that.Expertly', 'paced', 'thoughtful', 'dripping', 'suspense.The', 'film', 'place', 'Italy', 'where', 'hit-man', 'named', 'Jack', 'awaiting', 'details', 'final', 'assignment', 'done', 'out', 'pursue', 'life', 'filled', 'attachments', 'deprived', 'smothered', 'restraints', 'profession', 'stay', 'Italy', 'Jack', 'acquainted', 'high-class', 'hooker', 'named', 'Clara', 'fact', 'emotional', 'ties', 'are', 'dangerous', 'Jack', 'be', 'Instead', 'broaching', 'plot', 'point', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'generic', 'fashion', 'American', 'beautifully', 'camera', 'expose', 'inner', 'emotional', 'complexities', 'Jack', 'feelings', 'Clara', 'are', 'less', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'more', 'deep-seated', 'emotional', 'loss', 'experienced', 'years', 'distancing', 'everyone', 'Jack', 'eventual', 'job', 'head', 'world', 'unravel', 'professional', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'coexist', 'intimacies.George', 'Clooney', 'certainly', 'best', 'performance', 'years', ""'ve"", 'always', 'preferred', 'Clooney', 'comedic', 'finely', 'tuned', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'outstanding', 'so', 'layered', 'complex', 'Violante', 'Placido', 'gem', 'actress', 'Not', 'only', 'words', 'gorgeous', 'OMG', 'certainly', 'talented', 'enough', 'go', 'step', 'step', 'Clooney', 'demand', 'out', 'attention', 'also', 'mysterious', 'enough', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'what', 'true', 'intentions', 'are.The', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'director', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'film', 'debut', 'was', '2007', 'Control', 'what', 'debut', 'sophomore', 'effort', 'was', 'fluke', 'really', 'extremely', 'adept', 'creating', 'natural', 'tension', 'lens', 'pacing', 'projects', 'exude', 'stylistic', 'naturalism', 'way', 'surroundings', 'produce', 'such', 'lasting', 'imagery', 'physical', 'emotional', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'recommend', 'film', 'dwells', 'mind', 'eye', 'definitely', 'quite', 'impact', 'quieter', 'film', 'one', 'may', 'expect', 'quiet', 'moments', 'film', 'really', 'audience', 'Tackling', 'serious', 'subjects', 'such', 'self-doubt', 'spirituality', 'American', ""'"", 'brilliant', 'film', 'man', 'coming', 'terms', 'own', 'fate']",N/A

It's the kind of film that asks for your patience while it develops it's plot threads, but I found the end result really uneven; some parts were just tight with tension, while others just sort of plodded along, so it was really difficult to get into the whole movie. George Clooney was great, though, as Jack and portraying the multiple facets of his character; from a cold, emotionless hitman to a troubled soul looking to escape his `profession' and loneliness. Violante Placido is incredibly beautiful as Jack's love interest, Clara, and adds a lot of strength to the role. Thekla Reuten and Johan Leysen put in good turns as the villains of the piece while Paolo Bonacelli is the old priest who helps Jack find his way.The disc includes deleted scenes, `Journey to Redemption: The Making of The American' and director commentary, all unwatched unfortunately.",3,"Enjoyable enough, but slow and uneven....",1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,1402,"['American', 'casts', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Jack', 'gunman', 'hire', 'job', 'live', 'largely', 'solitary', 'life', 'when', 'attacked', 'Swedish', 'hitmen', 'Jack', 'small', 'town', 'Italy', 'where', 'job', 'building', 'custom', 'rifle', 'mysterious', 'hit-woman', 'worlds', 'collide', 'when', 'attracted', 'local', 'prostitute', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', 'up', 'yet.', 'American', 'more', 'slow-paced', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'director', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'enjoy', 'taking', 'time', 'build', 'things', 'up', 'kind', 'film', 'patience', 'plot', 'threads', 'found', 'end', 'result', 'really', 'uneven', 'parts', 'were', 'just', 'tight', 'tension', 'others', 'just', 'sort', 'plodded', 'was', 'really', 'difficult', 'get', 'whole', 'movie', 'George', 'Clooney', 'was', 'great', 'though', 'Jack', 'portraying', 'multiple', 'facets', 'character', 'cold', 'emotionless', 'hitman', 'troubled', 'soul', 'looking', 'escape', 'profession', 'loneliness', 'Violante', 'Placido', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'Jack', 'love', 'interest', 'Clara', 'lot', 'strength', 'role', 'Thekla', 'Reuten', 'Johan', 'Leysen', 'put', 'good', 'turns', 'villains', 'piece', 'Paolo', 'Bonacelli', 'old', 'priest', 'who', 'Jack', 'find', 'way.The', 'disc', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Journey', 'Redemption', 'Making', 'American', 'director', 'commentary', 'unwatched', 'unfortunately']",N/A

There is a very real sense of impending violence and doom that permeates this film. George Clooney is great as Jack, the hitman-gunsmith who is given one last assignment before retiring. Although there is a very slow-pacing through much of the film when we just watch as things quietly unfold, often with little or no dialogue or action, this is a strength rather than a weakness. Some people have said they find the film boring and too slow. It is not Bond or Bourne but a rich character study that takes it's own time unfolding. The location filming in Sweden and Italy provide plenty of visually stunning scenery. Violante Placido is also gorgeous and she provides plenty of sizzle with several nude scenes. I may learn Italian and go back to Italy again!! One of the most unsettling aspects of this film is that you are never too sure of people or their motives.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[10, 13]","Who would have thought that Hollywood could produce a taut murder-thriller without slamming every plot point down our throats? But there you have it: that's THE AMERICAN.George Clooney, whom I usually enjoy more in his comedic or semi-serious roles (O Brother, Where Art Thou?andBurn After Readingbeing two of my recent favorites) pulls in a dark, interesting, and dangerous character as Jack, a weapons man/hitman who's retirement from his chosen profession is proving extremely difficult.Making friends is risky to both Jack and those he likes, as we witness early on in the film what he's forced to do to a woman whose innocence means nothing when Jack is discovered in a Swedish hideout. Forcing Jack to leave, he travels to Italy where he's told to lay low and wait for instructions. And when the instructions come, the audience can feel those pin-pricks of caution raising on their necks.The great thing about The American is that Clooney is truly the only recognizable face for many U.S. film-watchers. But the rest of the cast are just as intense as Clooney's character. Great silences and moments of boredom are punctuated alongside moments of terrible aggression and death. And there's also sex, love, and priestly friendship intertwined.It's rare nowadays to find something like The American showing in U.S. cities, but most of us should be very glad it's here. Harkening back to Hitchcock days (but with a modern bent), this movie almost certainly would've never seen the light of the Western hemisphere had it not been for Clooney's pretty-boy face taking front and center stage. But as recognizable as Clooney's face is, it is NOT a typical Clooney role. Here we get the actor stretching himself into new (and greater) territory. I swear this movie had the fewest lines I've ever heard in a major Hollywood production; and I'm thankful for that because it helped up the tension.Indeed, it is the film's tension that drives the entire plot. We see and feel the battles raging within Jack as he's forced to decide whether to kill someone he's growing close to, or to let them live and risk his own life ...again. We also believe we know what's going to happen, and most of the time you'll be correct, but that it doesn't take away from the tension/impact of the movie shows how well put together this film truly is.Those looking for a kind ofBourne Identitystyle flick are going to be sorely disappointed if they think this is in-line with that action-driven drivel.

There are none of these in this tense drama/thriller headlined by George Clooney.  Clooney plays a hitman and master builder of customized weaponry on whom the tables are turned. The underlying personal drama involves Clooney's conflict between living the necessarily isolated and non-commital life of someone in his business with the profound need to be intimate with another human being.  This theme runs through the movie, not only in terms of Clooney's relationships with females, but with other people as well.The movie is paced very slowly and there are usually no more than two people on camera and they tend to be isolated in their scenes by the locales selected for filming: a lonely stream off the side of a road, an enclosed veranda high above a small town, a dark and sparsely furnished room.  These scenes create a constant sense of dislocation and unconnectedness to the larger world, so that if anything happened to the actors in the scene, little or nothing would ever be known of them.  The director used this cleverly to accentuate the sense of isolation felt by Clooney.Unless I missed it, the plot leaves the question of why Clooney became the prey unanswered, although this turn of events is consistent with the message that Clooney's profession is one of sudden, irrevesible and often regretable twists.This is one of those movies that leaves you more with material to ruminate over than with memorable scenes.  That is as it was intended to be and it works on that level.  If you are looking for a shoot 'em up, wild car chase movie of the current genre of excess, this is not it.

This is a work of redemption.  Not total redemption but some redemption.  And I don't know if I even believe in partial redemption for someone this dark, which is why it is not great.In the first ten minutes he kills people trying to kill him, which is fine.  However, he also, without any hesitation, kills someone else, someone personal.  He then has to go on the lam in Italy.  He does many things in Italy and obviously he is waiting for bad things to happen all of the time.  Since he is an assassin, he expects another assassin every time a car backfires or he sees another person even owning a gun. (The Italians do not seem shy about gun ownership in this small town so that isn't hard.)Can he in any way turn his life around or is it too late?  Can we exceed that last redemption point?  These are interesting questions and that is what the movie addresses.  It is NOT a thriller.  It is a very cerebral movie and it verges on being slow in its pacing as a result.

The daunting music and fast editing we see in the trailer is nothing more than typical Hollywood marketing propaganda. Add to that, the `cool movie trailer voice guy' on the radio advertisements describing George Clooney's character as `an assassin who lived in the shadows' and an audio clip of Clooney shouting `Who's side are you on?!' - and you're sitting in a bathtub of lies and disappointment. That line of dialogue was definitely voiced by Clooney, but never appears in this film.  All these things mentioned, are not to imply that I didn't enjoy the film.To call The American an action film would be to call The Bourne Identity a comedy. It's a drama with a gentle nod in the direction of being a thriller. It's an artsy film; long drawn out sequences of following the central character around doing normal everyday things like working out, driving, and walking down the street. There is little to no music in tow and very lean dialogue throughout. There - now you can stop reading and go see The Expendables if this isn't what you're looking forward to. Big Clooney fan like myself? Good - keep reading.George Clooney stars as, you guessed it - `the American', complete with all the glory of the most American of American names, particularly on the silver screen; Jack. Jack is an assassin who has grown weary of the lifestyle. The film opens with him on holiday with his Swedish lover. I won't reveal what happens, but I will tell you that it ignites the entire momentum of the film, and is the first of several unanswered questions the movie fails to provide. The one I'm talking about here being, why did he handle the situation in Sweden the way that he did? He expresses later that `she had nothing to do with it.' So why then? Who knows though; others may not have as many questions as I did.Because of the event in Sweden, Jack takes shelter in Italy. Why Italy? I don't know. Once there however, he is offered a new job by his employer, over the phone. It's clear from the get-go that Jack is trained in combat and is a skilled marksman. But the only proof he was an assassin comes from his boss telling him there is a mark and that he won't have to pull the trigger this time. Jack accepts the job.What is the job if he is not to kill this time around?; to construct the ultimate rifle for a client to do the killing herself. She wants a rifle with the power of a machine gun, but that can be silenced as much as possible. The scenes showing how Jack constructs this device were among some of my favorites.Jack forms two important relationships. One is with a woman named Clara (Violante Placido) who is a prostitute, and the second is a Catholic Priest. A rare combination of company to keep, I know.The relationship with the girl becomes a romance and is handled perfectly by both actors and the filmmakers. They deliver the hottest love scene of the year, as well as extraordinarily well acted scenes, often without dialogue being exchanged.At least from what I could tell, the priest is merely in the film for us to learn more about Jack's character. We do so by way of secondhand subtext found in the Father confessing the sins of his past to Jack, while Jack stays quiet - no doubt having dabbled in the same muck. Oh yeah, the priest is also there so that Clooney can look at the camera in an extreme close-up and deliver the gnarly one-liner, ""I don't think God's very interested in me, Father.""There are way too many things that are left unexplained; such as why there are men after Jack, wanting him dead, and why jack became an assassin in the first place. He claims, ""Everything I've done, I've had good cause to do."" But I hardly buy that he honestly believes that.Also, why did he not make a move on the woman he is sculpting the weapon for? She was clearly interested and he was constantly checking her out and his relationship with Clara had not yet blossomed. The only thing I have is maybe he doesn't mix business with pleasure? But then why the temptation in the story? We needed more answers. And what was the deal with the butterflies? I get the parallel, but what was Jack's fascination with them? I have one theory, but I'll leave that one for you to figure out.The thing The American has that most other films in theaters right now lack, is amazing cinematography; definitely some of the best I have seen this year. The camera tells the story. There are some really terrific shots and we are constantly following Jack through blind cornered alleys in the elegant Italian villas and the camera gives us the sense that there is someone lurking around every corner; and every so often someone is. Most films use music to give these scares away to us prematurely, while The American holds you in silence until we jump when Clooney's character does; that's good cinema.",4,The American

1310238,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B002ZG993Q,DanD,"[1, 1]","Easily the biggest surprise hit of the year, THE AMERICAN isn't quite an espionage thriller (it moves far too slowly), nor is it a romance (though there is plenty of that).  It's really one man's quest for identity, set against his job as an American spy in Italy, and involving his entanglement with some local beauties (who may or may not be who they seem).THE AMERICAN is a mostly-foreign film that certain does not fit the expectations of many of the people who saw it (check out all the negative reviews here for proof of that).  It's a slow-burner, heightened by George Clooney's melancholy performance; he's basically channeling UP IN THE AIR's Ryan Bingham through a watered-down Seth Gecko (FROM DUSK 'TIL DAWN).  We've seen him better, but he's perfect for this role.  The ladies who surround him--names woefully unfamiliar to most of us--easily hold their own.  The entire cast provides that extra touch of reality that anchors the film and gives it that extra bit of emotional resonance.Anton Corbijin's directing is equally top-notch.  The problem lies in the script (I won't comment on Martin Booth's novel, as I have not read it; typically, the book is better than the film, but you know this), which moves too slowly for its own good.  Not that this is a fast-paced story, or should be; but there can be tension in emotional tales, suspense in the mundane--we don't need bullets flying around to put us on the edge of our seats.

I didn't think it was fantastic, but I also didn't think it was horrible.Further disclosure: I don't particularly like George Clooney. I have nothing against the man, I simply don't find him charismatic on the screen in most cases (for contrast, I do find Cary Grant and John Cusack, for example, to be charismatic and able to carry most films they were ever involved in).Disclosure is out of the way, so let's get to it.This is a film that is not heavy on dialogue. This production style hearkens back to some of the great films of yore when the directors would rely on the visual information heavily to tell their stories. It works quite well in this film. I happened to like this aspect. If you think you can't handle a film that is sparse on dialogue to tell you what you need to know, this may not be for you.This is a film with slow pacing. I don't mean that in a bad way. Again, this style hearkens back to an earlier age when such pacing was relatively common and not riddled with explosions every 5 minutes to keep viewers interested. If you found Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on the River Kwai, Gone With the Wind, or even Blade Runner to be ""too slow"" and therefore ""boring"", this is probably not the film for you. That's not intended as an insult, just a bow to reality. Younger viewers especially have become accustomed to fast pacing, for better or for worse.The story is intriguing and well-developed and the acting is par for the course (not superb (but again, I've never found Clooney to be all that believable when it comes to emotional range...although I do believe he does a pretty good job for what his role calls for here) and not bad).Ultimately, I feel that the fact that several big questions were not resolved detracts from what otherwise would be a very fine story.Bottom line: Good film, but could have been much better with a few loose ends tied down.

Be warned those looking for an action filled generic thriller will be severely disappointed. This is an artful character study about a troubled assassin nearing the end of what we can tell to be a long career. The general tone of the film mirrors that of the characters personality, a tense and emotionally reserved perfectionist. There is not too much emotion through much of the film because like its main character it is hard for him and the film to open up, or let anyone in. This is probably the most suspenseful film I have seen this year. It becomes hard to trust anyone he meets and I found myself becoming just as paranoid as he was at times. The performances were all wonderful, this was the most reserved I have seen Clooney since ""Syriana"". He played the character with such subtly and depth. I thought the end was fantastic. I felt it was the only fitting conclusion to this story. Although this ending isn't the most original, with the help of Corbijn's meticulous story telling and Clooney's performance I found it to be quite upsetting.I can completely understand why some do not like this film but I absolutely loved it. I thought it was so fascinating and so well crafted. It was shot so beautifully and felt so much like it could have been a film by Jean-Pierre Melville.

1310253,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,B002ZG993Q,Edmonson,"[0, 0]","""The American""(2010) is directed by Anton Corbijn (Control). The film is an adaptation of the 1980 novel ""A Very Private Gentleman"" by Martin Booth. George Clooney(Jack) portrays an assassin who is also a custom arms dealer who flees to Italy in the mountains of Abruzzo. The movie is reminiscent of Antonioni's film ""The Passenger"" (1975) in its slow pace, feeling of alienation and spiral to a place where death waits. Jack is in hiding but is also extremely exposed being the lone American in the small Italian town of Castel del Monte. The town is a labyrinth which both conceals and traps Jack. He is always looking over his shoulder as he is continues to be pursued by assassins. What unfolds very gradually is his changing outlook on life, and his future possibilities when he befriends another foreigner, Clara (Violante Placido), who's a prostitute. The film reads more like an existential film, than a typical thriller of cat and mouse, as it focuses on the life a man has chosen that leads him essentially to a dead end with little chance of escape.",4,Coming face to face with a dead end...,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,1060,"['American', '2010', 'directed', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'Control', 'film', 'adaptation', '1980', 'novel', 'Very', 'Private', 'Gentleman', 'Martin', 'Booth', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Jack', 'assassin', 'who', 'also', 'custom', 'arms', 'dealer', 'who', 'Italy', 'mountains', 'Abruzzo', 'movie', 'reminiscent', 'Antonioni', 'film', 'Passenger', '1975', 'slow', 'pace', 'feeling', 'alienation', 'spiral', 'place', 'where', 'death', 'waits', 'Jack', 'hiding', 'also', 'extremely', 'exposed', 'being', 'lone', 'American', 'small', 'Italian', 'town', 'Castel', 'del', 'Monte', 'town', 'labyrinth', 'conceals', 'traps', 'Jack', 'always', 'looking', 'shoulder', 'be', 'pursued', 'assassins', 'What', 'unfolds', 'very', 'gradually', 'changing', 'outlook', 'life', 'future', 'possibilities', 'when', 'foreigner', 'Clara', 'Violante', 'Placido', 'who', 'prostitute', 'film', 'more', 'existential', 'film', 'typical', 'thriller', 'cat', 'mouse', 'life', 'man', 'chosen', 'essentially', 'dead', 'end', 'little', 'chance', 'escape']",N/A

Jack (George Clooney) is an intelligence operator/hit man who escapes a hit put on him. But his blown cover has caused him to kill the woman he was with. A woman he was beginning to care for. He heads to Italy where he's given an assignment to fabricate a rifle for someone else's hit. As he mixes with the locals and examines his life he finds himself at a very dangerous juncture.This film failed in the marketing. It was such that most probably figured this was a Bourne type flick. It's anything but. This is about a man who deals death but wants to experience life. He wants to sleep peacefully and walk around without looking over his shoulder. As he walks through the narrow, high-walled streets of the town, he looks like a rat trapped in a maze. He wants to fall in love but can't risk it so he makes certain that when he visits the local brothel, he always gets the same girl. That's as close as he can come. He's gentle at heart. He has a thing for butterflies. He reads about them and has one tattooed on his back. As all the locals refer to him as ""The American"" he's as much an outsider in life as he is an outsider in the country. Many felt that there were long stretches of the movie where nothing happened. To me there wasn't a wasted scene to be found. Every expression, gesture or word was well thought out. Clooney does a great job in the role. When you see him building the gun he's very comfortable with it. It were as though he'd done it a thousand times before.Great attention is paid to the village and landscapes. It depicts the beauty Clooney wants to find in his life. The editing is seamless and the music well underscores what's happening on the screen. See this movie.

George said he now has the clout to make these kinds of movies and this is a perfect example. It is surely not the flash bang of a Michael Bay extravaganza or a romantic comedy or a typical spy thriller.I would have to classify it as a thinking person's thriller. George plays a kind of assassin who makes specialized weapons for other assassins. He is extremely paranoid and with good reason. The problem with this piece is that a whole lot of nothing happens for a good bit of the movie. It is slow. Yet at the same time, there is really a lot going on. It just creeps up on you. As he hides out in the small Italian town, he does this one last job. He is warned by his handler not to make any friends, which he does anyway. That gives me the impression that the hooker he meets and falls for is a dead woman walking.Someone is leaking his location and as the movie progresses, it becomes clear that there are only so many characters it could be. Is it the priest that befriends him? Is it the hooker he falls for? Is it the female assassin he is making the weapon for?What I didn't like is the final scene that a glass-is-half-empty person would say is a bummer ending, while a glass-is-half-full person would say well... maybe, just maybe... As the audience, we suffer through all the slow buildup for that? I know many people would get angry at the slap in the face, while others would say ""What do you expect?"" In a way, I hate movies like this one. Still, there were things about it I liked well enough to go above three stars. I will not go as far as five because of the ending. I loved the European scenery. After living in Spain for 10 years, it all feels very familiar to me.If you are into artsy thinking-type movies and don't mind ambiguous endings, you might like this one.

1310260,AY12DBB0U420B,B002ZG993Q,Gary Peterson,"[2, 2]","Last night's bargain rack movie was ""The American"" DVD which I picked up at a nearby Ross Store. It starred George Clooney as, you guessed it, the American. The story took place in Sweden (a little bit) and Italy (mostly) and the filming was excellent. This part of italy was just beautiful, and quite picturesque and the photographers really picked it up. By and large, the acting was quite good, although there wasn't much in the way of character development with any of the people. The women were the best in this respect. The men were silent types with a cold and cruel personas.As to the story, it was an action movie without much action. The story had Clooney as some type of assassin (never really specified as to why) with a stone-faced man of few words as a distant accomplice. Their main contacts were through extremely limited phone conversations. Clooney was in on a botched job in Sweden, in which he cruelly and cold-bloodedly murdered his lady friend, and he was whisked off to Italy until the heat died down. Well, in Italy, he started to meet more rather nice women and worked on a high-tech assassination weapon. Too much of the movie was devoted to his work, I might add. You're looking for action? Well it never really unfolded, so I hope you're satisfied with a smattering of limited dialog. The movie was a tour of the largely empty streets of this charming Italian village and visits to their largely empty shops. Clooney portrayed an emotionless stone-faced killer on assignment, except the assignment was never specified. Oh yes, a number of guys wanted him dead, including one from Sweden. Ho-humm.

1310262,A234L7R41ZLI3H,B002ZG993Q,"ginmar ""book/digital addict""","[3, 4]","""The American"" makes you work to pick up the things that are often conveyed by the holes left behind by characters who use as few words as possible. This makes the watcher a participant,  which is rather enjoyable, given that many films today spoon feed the simplest of plots, characters, and conclusions to their audience.  The movie is occupied as much by what people don't do as what they do; as much as by what they don't say as what one expects them to say.  Pleasantries are omitted, hinting at a life lived apart from others; glances are hint at pursuit rather than attraction,  but the pursuers themselves are likewise skilled at making themselves barely visible. Clooney's character uses words as if he has to withdraw them from a safety deposit box.All the characters, it seems, are hiding secrets, some of them relatively harmless, some more serious,  more dubious. The characters' reticence gives the viewer time to study them, to assess them, in a way that so many other films simply make impossible, due to the busyness that crowds the screen.  One has time to reflect on what's missing from these characters,  even what might have caused it. The characters, for all the guarding of secrets that they do,  are original, because the very act of hiding a secret often makes it apparent one exists.Clooney's character attempts to blend in by being quiet, unsociable, nearly silent. Yet these things attract notice even in a small, quiet town. The movie, notably, does not engage in Italian stereotypes,  no ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" style Mediterranean gawdy antics. So understated is the dialogue that often several avenues suggest themselves,  and that's what makes this movie so risky: the ending was never assured,  because it did not hesitate in portraying Clooney's Jack as utterly ruthless and logical, determined to survive---no matter who got in the way. The film does not sugar coat the character at all, gives him a clinical outlook,  even in the one or two scenes that a lesser actor would have used to go for the sloppy emoting that passes for good performing. One gets the sense---as the character shifts back to survival mode after relaxing for a bit-----that he is trying a new maneuver to deflect the villagers' interest in him, seeing if it works.The understatement of Clooney's performance hints at the tightly-wound history of a man who cannot take any mistake for granted,  any moment of relaxation, any contact with a human being.  I was sort of struck by how it would have been utterly fatal for him to have, say,  mistaken, the number for the combination that was given to him by the person sampling his craftmanship.  In ordinary life, it is simple; one makes a phone call,  admits the error. In this life,  the concession that is granted for another issue is quite nearly a threat.The town where this was filmed is as much a character as are the human beings that live in it,  with its narrow streets and wide steps,  severe stone walls and ancient age.  There are so many intriguing little side streets,  archways, stairways, all packed on top of one another,  that it's like a maze that leads one to more and more discoveries. One could make a whole travelogue following those streets in that small town.The movie does such an unsettlingly good job of making one doubt every character----an odd compliment----that during a picnic when a woman holds a pose for a few seconds too long one wonders if she's dead,  even while the setting evokes ""Dejeuner sur l'herbe""---and the tight, unsettling expression on Clooney's face lingers a beat or two too long to be comfortable----or easily assessed.Another original moment is a car chase. Rather than turns and twists that realistically would wind up with everyone in a ditch,  in fact,  both drivers DO wind up in the ditch, so to speak. It's not thrilling. It's  nerve wracking,  because from the film's first scene, one knows that any character is expendable. It would entirely possible for the film to off its main character halfway through and still carry on with the plot.When emotions do start to show up----but not in anything like Hollywood quantities----they seem almost gaudy, like the rose one glimpses in an espalier against a gray stone wall. This is the movie's one real weakness; the main character's sudden statement of something that seems to come rather out of the blue,  given all his understatement before.While I can't say the movie is without flaw----though I'm hard pressed, really, to think of anything beyond that brief moment noted above----I feel that one has to be sparing with five star ratings, though perhaps I am shortchanging this understated film, which is so different from the fare one usually sees come out of Hollywood.  Serious Hollywood movies like to teach one a lesson,  or have a big message. This one does not. It is just one character and the people around him, and after a diet of Hollywood junk, this low key movie whose predominant color is gray seemed to leave the most vivid impression.",4,The type of

1310263,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002ZG993Q,Grady Harp,"[2, 4]","THE AMERICAN is decidedly not an American made movie.  The subtlety and intelligence of foreign films is everywhere evident - the minimal dialogue, the use of poignant silences, the lighting of tense moments, and the acting. Dutch director Anton Corbijn has achieved just the right amount of subdued tension that propels this story based on Martin Booth's novel  'A Very Private Gentleman' and adapted for the screen by Rowan Joffee. The result is an understated elegy about fear and questions of trust.The film opens in snowbound Sweden where assassin Jack (George Clooney, pared down physically and giving a performance of extraordinary subtlety), thinking that he is hiding, is discovered and must flee.  He receives instructions from his 'boss' Pavel (Johan Leysen) to go to a small town in Italy to await further assignments and to make no friends.  In the little Italian town Jack receives his next assignment - to build a very small but deadly weapon for a Belgian assassin Mathilde (Thekla Reuten).  Jack agrees to this 'last assignment', gathers the materials for the weapon, meeting the town priest  Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli) who is able to read Jack like few others  ('You cannot deny the existence of hell. You live in it. It is a place without love.') and assists Jack in finding parts for the weapon from one Fabio (Filippo Timi) who has a close physical resemblance to the old priest. Jack also encounters a prostitute Clara (Violante Placido) and finds his business arrangement with her evolving into something more meaningful.  Jack's life is further disrupted when a Swedish assassin finds Jack's hiding place and Jack must destroy or be destroyed.  He finally completes the weapon for Mathilde, the weapon is accepted, and Jack decides to make good on his decision to have this as his last assignment.  But fate has a different idea and the ending of the film is intensely dramatic.This is a very quiet movie; the musical score by Herbert Gr&ouml;nemeyer is most often a single finger piano score, the cinematography by Martin Ruhe captures the beauty of both snowy Sweden and isolated Italy while keeping a close focus on the sensitive face of Clooney.  Though this film will not please those who love  loud, conflagration CGI effects, for those who enjoy the beauty of understatement and sensitive character studies this film is first class. The film is as much about what is not said or shown as it is with the quiet action it provides.  It is a pleasure to see George Clooney expand his acting horizons this way.

YEO ""gyeo""","[17, 22]","I was expecting a thriller - but Anton Corbijn serves up a post modern Euro style 70s like film - which reminded me of Soderbergh's Solaris - a decidedly non commercial vehicle.  Despite his box office veneer, George Clooney has eclectic tastes as an actor and filmmaker, and The American is no exception.If you're expecting a Steve McQueen kind of show - forget it.  If you're expecting The Bourne Identity - which I was - this is not the case.  If you're expecting Nicholas Roeg meets Ernest Hemingway with a rifle - I think you'll have The American.  This is not a plot driven film, but a character study of an arms maker.  Strangely, it felt like George Clooney's character from ""Up in the Air"" had moved sideways to inhabit this movie.  Meaning that Clooney is basically getting into that existentialist mode again.  His character is confronted with the meaning of life.The minimalist soundtrack keeps you in the moment of this Italian setting.  Lots of rolling hills, clouds, and many angles of George Clooney's car scurrying up and down the winding road.  I could imagine the filmmaker there with his tripod.Although not excruciatingly slow, I would hesitate to call this a thriller, but it embraces from what I've seen the feel of the book.  The plot is not airtight, but wikipedia fortunately is available to help the viewer tie up loose ends!  Violante Placido is a sight for sore eyes and the Italian girlfriend you never had.  For the ladies, Clooney shows that he's still a taut looking sex symbol.  Actually, my friends and I thought he might have been slightly too good looking for the part.  I could think of various other character actors that would have sucked me in.  James Woods anyone?  Robert Redford?I would've amped up the plot a little more, but that was never the intention.  So be warned!  Those seeking George Clooney in thriller mode will be better off watching Michael Clayton (again).  I will always remember Anton Corbijn for shooting U2's album covers (Joshua Tree) (PS - I mixed him up with Phil Joanou - the man who directed U2 in their concert doc ""Rattle & Hum"" - thanks to Spammypig for correcting me) - and it's good to see he's still around.",3,Understated is the Word - anyone remember Solaris??,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,2181,"['was', 'expecting', 'thriller', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'up', 'post', 'modern', 'Euro', 'style', '70s', 'film', 'reminded', 'Soderbergh', 'Solaris', 'decidedly', 'non', 'commercial', 'vehicle', 'box', 'office', 'veneer', 'George', 'Clooney', 'eclectic', 'tastes', 'actor', 'filmmaker', 'American', 'exception.If', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'kind', 'show', 'forget', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'was', 'not', 'case', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Nicholas', 'Roeg', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'rifle', 'think', ""'ll"", 'have', 'American', 'not', 'plot', 'driven', 'film', 'character', 'study', 'arms', 'maker', 'Strangely', 'felt', 'George', 'Clooney', 'character', 'Up', 'Air', 'had', 'moved', 'sideways', 'inhabit', 'movie', 'Meaning', 'Clooney', 'basically', 'getting', 'existentialist', 'mode', 'again', 'character', 'confronted', 'meaning', 'life.The', 'minimalist', 'soundtrack', 'moment', 'Italian', 'setting', 'Lots', 'rolling', 'hills', 'clouds', 'many', 'angles', 'George', 'Clooney', 'car', 'scurrying', 'up', 'winding', 'road', 'could', 'imagine', 'filmmaker', 'tripod.Although', 'not', 'excruciatingly', 'slow', 'would', 'hesitate', 'call', 'thriller', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'feel', 'book', 'plot', 'not', 'airtight', 'wikipedia', 'fortunately', 'available', 'help', 'viewer', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'Violante', 'Placido', 'sight', 'sore', 'eyes', 'Italian', 'girlfriend', 'never', 'had', 'ladies', 'Clooney', 'still', 'taut', 'looking', 'sex', 'symbol', 'Actually', 'friends', 'thought', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'slightly', 'too', 'good', 'looking', 'part', 'could', 'think', 'various', 'other', 'character', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'sucked', 'James', 'Woods', 'anyone', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'would', ""'ve"", 'amped', 'up', 'plot', 'little', 'more', 'was', 'never', 'intention', 'So', 'be', 'warned', 'seeking', 'George', 'Clooney', 'thriller', 'mode', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'again', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'shooting', 'U2', 'album', 'Joshua', 'Tree', 'PS', 'mixed', 'up', 'Phil', 'Joanou', 'man', 'who', 'directed', 'U2', 'concert', 'doc', 'Rattle', 'Hum', 'thanks', 'Spammypig', 'correcting', 'good', 'see', 'still', 'around']",N/A

Nice soundtrack too (done by Herbert Groenemeyer, a normally rather horrible German pop star; but don't worry, he doesn't sing here, just plays the piano, thanks Herbert!).Great job by Clooney, the central character. The story is rather small, which suits the whole concept. Most of the time we watch Clooney practicing the craft of his character, or trying not to make friends, according to instructions and rules of reason. Or we watch him being bewildered, which he does very well.Despite the title, this is not after a Henry James novel. (I will review that one soon anyway.) The subject is only marginally Jamesian: an American expatriate in Italy, with some social problems and a special predicament. James was more interested in painters and sculptors and businessmen.

The main difference between those two horrible movies, both of which could be used to extract information from terrorists, was the acting. The actors in New World seemed to actually care, and earnestly tried to salvage that horrible train wreck of a movie, whereas The American lacks everything that would make a good movie, good.

1310277,A1KHWLUBS5IK4Q,B002ZG993Q,janebbooks,"[3, 3]","Have you seen ""The American"" with George Clooney? Confused by butterflies and rifles? It's a beautifully filmed movie...majestic mountains, snow scenes, hilltop villages. Set in Sweden in the early scenes but shifting to a medieval village in the hill country of Northern Italy for the remainder of the film. Although the critics say the only thing American about the film is the title and Mr. Clooney, they are rating the movie three out of five stars probably for the cinematography.The film is an adaptation of the 1990 book by British writer Martin Booth (1944-2004)) entitled A VERY PRIVATE GENTLEMAN: the book explains all. Booth's tale is a character study about a loner who is no ""gentleman"": it is also a tragedy following events in the life of a gunsmith who sells his services to assassins. The style is partly in the form of classic confessional writing, as the protagonist seeks to explain the relevance of his choice of profession. The time of the story seems to be late 20th century, more or less similar to the year of publication. The story is written in the first-person narrative from the point of view of the main character, who is known as Edmund or Signor Farfalla.There are only three major characters in both media (perfectly cast in the film especially George Clooney as Farfalla):....Signor Farfalla ""Mr. Butterfly"" is a middle-aged man from a country where English is spoken as a first language. He is loner who paints miniatures of butterflies and has traveled to the area to capture a unque native specimen. He is also a ""shadow-dweller,"" a technical weapons expert who creates and supplies tools for high-level assassins. He is a lecturer of sorts in the novel, who is not apologetic about his profession: he sees the need for people who kill to change the world for the better. In the film, Farfalla is consumed by a feeling of doom over the use of his weapons...and vows that he will retire after finishing the current product....Father Bendetto is the local Catholic priest in the Italian village. He befriends Farfalla, and they discover a common interest in wine, food, and discussion and debate....Clara is a young Italian student. She meets Farfalla when he becomes her regular customer in the local bordello.THE AMERICAN is a movie that will view better after reading the book! Even reading the reviews of the book will enlightened you. The main differences between the novel and the film are the aesthetic tone and the ending. Both endings are satisfactory...but only after reading the novel and viewing the film adaption...can one choose a favorite...Postscript: The professional reviews of this novel are displayed on the original product page forA Very Private Gentleman: A Novel.

1310278,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B002ZG993Q,Jason Bean,"[193, 223]","I find 'The American' a hard sell as a film. It's not an action-thriller like the trailers make it out to be, nor would I call it a character drama or art house piece. I can't see either of these audiences appreciating this film on the level it wants you to. I think that's why I like it so much, there's nothing else like it in theaters (at least not right now).'The American' is about cold-blooded professional ""Jack"" who, after being attacked in Sweden with his girlfriend (which ends violently but not the way you think) is directed by his associate to hide out in a small town in Italy. He ends up friending a priest and a prostitute and takes a job building/modifying a weapon for an assassin. Of course his old enemies catch up to him but the movie chooses more to focus on the main character's slow change from cold-professional to 'maybe' redeemable human being. There's some (very good) action and sex but the story's told in a very leisurely fashion with little dialogue. It's more about what's NOT said between and by characters that gives this movie it's weight and suspense.The camera work in this film is stunning, and that's a good thing. With the action and  unrevealing dialogue taking a back-seat the movies' long, beautiful shots of Italy really set the movie's mood well and gives the sense of isolation and seeming solitude for it's main character. The slow moving scenes of repetition involving the main character constructing a weapon and the brief word exchanges between the main character and another assassin (a terrific Thekla Reuten) perfectly reflects the mindset the film is in.George Clooney took a big risk being cast in this film. It's unconventional and will easily put off his usual fans. I can even understand his performance of such a cold-hearted character being written off as one dimensional. I can only say I found Clooney perfectly convincing the entire way through and I hope he gets the recognition he deserves. The rest of the cast is non-americans with Violante Placido a stand-out (in more ways than one) as the prostitute whom Clooney befriends and eventually seems to fall for.The DVD release of 'The American' looks very slick (even on my crappy tube-television) and comes with an insightful making-of that sheds light on the ideas the directors and producers put into the film. While there are some great cast interviews sadly there's not one with George Clooney. I would've loved to know his take on his character but there is some fun 'behind the camera' footage of him chatting and playing around with the rest of the crew so it's obvious he had fun making this movie.As I said 'The American' is not for everyone and is very much NOT the movie it's advertised as. It's a slow-moving, adult thriller that manages to be engaging and unpredictable without non-stop action and dialogue.

In the beginning scenes in Sweden we see the killer instincts of its protagonist, Jack (George Clooney), who is an efficient killing machine. Jack goes on the run to Italy where he receives his orders in succinct telephone messages from a devious double-dealing Pavel.He goes to a mountain town in Abruzzi where we see that Jack is losing his edge, his mojo. He's beginning to crave human contact and love which can get him in trouble. He's an armorer who is making a precision sniper rifle for a female assassin. How he gets the necessary equipment in his apartment is a mystery in itself. There are long passages demonstrating his gun-making skills. He's a very clever gunsmith but an ineffective human being. He falls in love with a prostitute, and slowly through his friendship with the local priest he has an epiphany. He's haunted and hunted. It has some very erotic, steamy scenes.Lately as in ""Up in the Air"", Clooney has been taking these parts of men with ice in their veins, soulless entities, loners who learn too late that they can no longer reach out to get human contact and redeem themselves. Jack is basically a sociopath seeking solace and love.The movie has great photography and fine views of the Italian mountain region, but like Jack viewers may find something lacking.",4,"Clooney Is a Loner, but Is He a Loser?",1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,1382,"['American', 'one', 'slowest', 'paced', 'action/thriller', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'Sweden', 'see', 'killer', 'instincts', 'protagonist', 'Jack', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'efficient', 'killing', 'machine', 'Jack', 'run', 'Italy', 'where', 'orders', 'succinct', 'telephone', 'messages', 'devious', 'double-dealing', 'Pavel.He', 'mountain', 'town', 'Abruzzi', 'where', 'see', 'Jack', 'losing', 'edge', 'mojo', 'beginning', 'crave', 'human', 'contact', 'love', 'can', 'get', 'trouble', 'armorer', 'who', 'making', 'precision', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'female', 'assassin', 'How', 'necessary', 'equipment', 'apartment', 'mystery', 'are', 'long', 'passages', 'demonstrating', 'gun-making', 'skills', 'very', 'clever', 'gunsmith', 'ineffective', 'human', 'being', 'love', 'prostitute', 'slowly', 'friendship', 'local', 'priest', 'epiphany', 'haunted', 'hunted', 'very', 'erotic', 'steamy', 'scenes.Lately', 'Up', 'Air', 'Clooney', 'been', 'taking', 'parts', 'men', 'ice', 'veins', 'soulless', 'entities', 'loners', 'who', 'learn', 'too', 'late', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'reach', 'out', 'get', 'human', 'contact', 'redeem', 'Jack', 'basically', 'sociopath', 'seeking', 'solace', 'love.The', 'movie', 'great', 'photography', 'fine', 'views', 'Italian', 'mountain', 'region', 'Jack', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'something', 'lacking']",N/A

The visuals are very attractive.  I found myself frequently freezing the action just to enjoy the frame as a still photo (viewed on 1080p 50"").  The scenic views of towns and countryside in Italy were fabulous.  At the opening of the movie I enjoyed the evocative spell of the snow covered frozen lake in , presumably per the plot, Sweden.There are some attractive women in this movie.  Clooney himself is shown doing exercises in his room at about 48 years of age that I stopped doing at 38.  Things like tip of the toe push ups, chin ups, and crunchy sit ups.  He looks good.  He looks like he's personally disciplined.  By golly, he can certainly afford a personal trainer and it shows.  Kudos to him for his fine physical conditioning.The movie itself is, in fact, much better viewed as a comic parody of the genre than as something serious.  Yes, I know, it's supposed to be serious. Perhaps with another 15 or 20 minutes of materials....like who are these ""Swedes""?  Swedes?  C'mon.The ""Swedes"" find the the secret love shack ( by the frozen lake ) where the retired hit man is sequestered with a lady of very lovely proportions.  Alas,well, no spoilers here.....but what's his past, who's the woman, where's the lake, how did the ""Swedes"" find him?  So, he's off on a train to Rome.But, his handler, is never identified with any nation, group, organization etc.  But, the handler in Rome tells our man he's not safe in the eternal city and must leave.  He's told where to hole up and magically ""just one more"" job pops up.There's quite a bit of action in the Italian town.  People get shot, cars get raced, bad guys ( at least guys who are after the main character bad guy ) get killed here and there yet all the while nobody even looks out the window of this sleepy town.  You'd think it was deserted.The plot is as thin as the soup fed to Ivan Denisovitch in the gulag.  The final scene is awash in gore and features hundreds of witnesses during a religious procession in the town yet they all dutifully disappear.  No police of any kind are ever seen or, for that matter, even called.  One endearing thing about the movie, for someone older, is that cell phones are not used as the ever present writer's crutch.  Our man uses a pay phone booth.  For those old enough to recall the TV show or young enough to have watched the reruns....this guy does remind me of Maxwell Smart.The movie simply isn't serious.  If you want a serious movie you will probably consider this one lukewarm at best.

1310296,A356RFKNIG043B,B002ZG993Q,K. Swanson,"[3, 3]","This is NOT an action film, or even remotely Hollywood in any way; it's a quiet character study. So don't watch it if, like many of the reviewers here, you need Action! Thrills! Excitement! Combining the slow, peaceful feel of '60s and '70s European cinema with Leone's Man With No Name series, The American works due to Clooney's finely measured performance and director Anton Corbijn's gorgeous sense of composition and light.I picked up this blu-ray (a sweet transfer with a fair but short doc and a few deleted scenes as extras) when I saw Corbijn's name, as I've loved his photography since seeing his first album covers in the late '70s, and his classic Art Of Noise Beat Box video in 1983. His work for U2 around The Joshua Tree era was iconic, and he's done so much gorgeous art I figured this would at least look good. And that it does, very much so. The splendid Italian Abruzzo hill country makes this film come alive, and the many fine supporting actors bring a solid sense of realism to the proceedings. Which is why a few blown details were rather irking..[Spoilers...] I just can't buy that after a bunch of shots, a crashed car with a dead man inside and shot-out windows and tires, along with an innocent local shot to death up the street, nobody is around to look, nor that the police don't have the town swarmed the next day. And why does the gun blow up at the end? Did George do it on purpose? And falling in love with the hooker didn't really gel either. But oh well, I guess you just have to take what you get.And most of what we get here is very good indeed. As long as you're not waiting on a murder a minute like most modern thrillers, you'll get many fine moments here, including a nice opening shock. Ultimately, this is very much a European film, not even vaguely Hollyweird, and that's a lot of what's so good about it.

The first was that Clooney's character carried what I believe was a Walthe PPK (James Bond's gun), which is a small-caliber handgun. With it he shot two professional assassins with rifles who had set up to take him out -- laughably impossible. Perhaops a minor quibble, but isn't it time that movie makers get guns right? The second problem I had was with the movie's ending (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Although we ca't be sure whether or not he lives after passing out, didn't you hunger for a heroic ending where he triumphs and gets away with his beautiful girl friend? It seems that Hollywood isn't comfortable with male heroes any more -- female ones are OK -- but men simply cannot be heroic any more. I see this as part of the feminine mystique ideology that has slowly permeated contemporary life, including films and television. When men do heroic things in movies these days, the films are often cartoonish.

The second time I saw the whole thing and asked myself, ""Is something going on here?"" Well, yes, but not much.Director Aaron Corbijn's effort to make a Charles Bronson-type crime drama with George Clooney in the lead goes awry almost from the beginning. Instead of successfully hawking Bronson's typical intense, aloof and cold-blooded loner, Clooney is awash in a Johnny one note straight-faced mug with more paranoia than Gene Hackman demonstrated inThe Conversation. Instead of a confident hit man that knows what he's doing, he's more the schizophrenic lottery winner that didn't pay the taxes and then sees the IRS around every corner.This is a story about George Clooney as an Ameican hit man in Europe. He departs Sweden when he learns he is the next target and meanders to Italy. In one of crime drama's most enduring cliches, he agrees to one last hit that you know will be his undoing. Instead of being the hitter, he provides the weaponry. He acquires a girlfriend and has movie foreplay with the similarly gorgeous killer-to-be, a beauty with her clothes on (unlike his girlfriend in half her scenes,) and he develops a relationship with a priest. A theme grows around Clooney's inability to relate, the killing of a bunch of Italian prostitutes (that's where he meets his girlfriend), foreplay with the other killer, and Clooney's eventual route out of this life that gets played out at an Italian stream.Throw in a duplicitous front man and you have the makings of a confusing, go nowhere crime drama that is fully realized by inadequate acting and a startling lack of direction. It's a nice travelouge small town Italy and its countryside, with a few snowy scenes in Sweden, but otherwise this is a needlessly predicatble film. I figured out the denouement about 5 minutes into this movie and I wasn't wrong (almost said I wasn't disappointed but I was.) The thematic material led me there, as did the lack of direction. It's been done to death in good and bad crime dramas over the years; if you saw Victor Mature meet his fate in 1947'sKiss of Death, you know what to expect here.Comparing this to other bad crime dramas I know, it has commonalities with Richard Gere'sBreathless, the 1983 remake of the French filmA Bout de Souffleabout an American girl and a French criminal in Paris.

1310301,A2XTBEWAF272NG,B002ZG993Q,Layo,"[0, 1]","I'm fascinated by assassins, and watch every movie in this genre that I come across.  The gorgeous locations in Italy and Sweden and the beautiful cinematography whetted my appetite and made me want to love this film, but the icy, terse portrayal of the American was like a door slammed in my face.  What I wanted to see was his interior: how did he become what he is, and what drives his choices?  But he was like a man in a dream when he wasn't in an action sequence, skilled and sensual but unconscious of himself and not in control of the unfolding of his fate.  In a way this was interesting: here is a person with extremely high physical intelligence but almost no emotional intelligence, and the result of this is a paradox: a person who has the power to win almost any life-or-death conflict in which he finds himself (and he is almost always on the defensive, surviving with the proficiency of a finely-honed automaton much like the weapons that he builds) but who, though perfect in all the details, finds himself powerless with regard to controlling the grand scope of his life.In a trope that verges on the nauseatingly cliche, the killer's weakness is love, which he unwillingly finds when it sneaks up on him through purchased sex.  The masculine paranoia of this point of view is so thoroughly established in our culture that the movie makes no attempt to justify it with the reality of the American's relationships.  We are supposed to accept that a man like him can't have love, and that if he chooses it, one of the lovers is doomed.  We know that's because love introduces chaos into his tightly-controlled, almost robotic life, and puts him at the mercy of something that he can't control: but the movie does a poor job of proving this to the audience through the action, dialogue or plot.  We're merely supposed to accept our prejudice that for men of action, depth of feeling is poison.  I found this very disappointing.  For those of us who question this premise, the movie doesn't make much sense.The whole thing is almost like running around in the psyche of a paranoid man: other people are hangers on which to drape his projections.  Thus the love interest is nothing but beauty and sensuality, not really a person in her own right; his employer is as irrationally treacherous as a Freudian father figure, but we never understand why he's doing what he does; his friend is senselessly kind and nonjudgmental, an archetype of mercy and potential redemption who doesn't seem to really have his own needs.  Why do any of these people feel the way they do about the American?  We never find out.  I think we are meant to care about him automatically and identify with those who love him, but I did not care about him and found their sincere warmth perplexing.  These are people whose professions (elderly priest, prostitute) should have made them astute and cynical judges of character, but they let this monster past all their boundaries.  Why would they do that?  Because they're poorly-created characters, mere vehicles for the unfolding of the hitman's angst: they are mirrors in which he sees himself, and the man he presumably begins to wish he could become.What I like about this though is that a killer probably does see the world this way.  The ultimate shallowness of this movie fits his emotionally-stunted point of view.  What I don't like about this is that it's hard to tell whether this is a deliberate choice on the part of the filmmaker, or whether he's equally shallow, thus making this movie the pretentious failure it felt like upon first viewing.",3,This one needed to sink in for awhile,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,3590,"[""'m"", 'fascinated', 'assassins', 'watch', 'movie', 'genre', 'come', 'gorgeous', 'locations', 'Italy', 'Sweden', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'whetted', 'appetite', 'made', 'want', 'love', 'film', 'icy', 'terse', 'portrayal', 'American', 'was', 'door', 'slammed', 'face', 'What', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'interior', 'how', 'did', 'become', 'what', 'what', 'choices', 'was', 'man', 'dream', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'action', 'sequence', 'skilled', 'sensual', 'unconscious', 'not', 'control', 'unfolding', 'fate', 'way', 'was', 'interesting', 'here', 'person', 'extremely', 'high', 'physical', 'intelligence', 'almost', 'emotional', 'intelligence', 'result', 'paradox', 'person', 'who', 'power', 'win', 'almost', 'life-or-death', 'conflict', 'almost', 'always', 'defensive', 'surviving', 'proficiency', 'finely-honed', 'automaton', 'much', 'weapons', 'who', 'perfect', 'details', 'powerless', 'regard', 'controlling', 'grand', 'scope', 'life.In', 'trope', 'nauseatingly', 'cliche', 'killer', 'weakness', 'love', 'unwillingly', 'when', 'up', 'purchased', 'sex', 'masculine', 'paranoia', 'point', 'view', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'established', 'culture', 'movie', 'attempt', 'justify', 'reality', 'American', 'relationships', 'are', 'supposed', 'accept', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'love', 'one', 'lovers', 'doomed', 'know', 'love', 'introduces', 'chaos', 'tightly-controlled', 'almost', 'robotic', 'life', 'mercy', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'movie', 'poor', 'job', 'proving', 'audience', 'action', 'dialogue', 'plot', ""'re"", 'merely', 'supposed', 'accept', 'prejudice', 'men', 'action', 'depth', 'feeling', 'poison', 'found', 'very', 'disappointing', 'who', 'question', 'premise', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'almost', 'running', 'around', 'psyche', 'paranoid', 'man', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'hangers', 'drape', 'projections', 'Thus', 'love', 'interest', 'nothing', 'beauty', 'sensuality', 'not', 'really', 'person', 'own', 'right', 'employer', 'irrationally', 'treacherous', 'Freudian', 'father', 'figure', 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'doing', 'what', 'friend', 'senselessly', 'kind', 'nonjudgmental', 'archetype', 'mercy', 'potential', 'redemption', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'have', 'own', 'needs', 'Why', 'do', 'people', 'feel', 'way', 'do', 'American', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'think', 'are', 'meant', 'care', 'automatically', 'identify', 'who', 'love', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'found', 'sincere', 'warmth', 'perplexing', 'are', 'people', 'professions', 'elderly', 'priest', 'prostitute', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'astute', 'cynical', 'judges', 'character', 'let', 'monster', 'boundaries', 'Why', 'would', 'do', ""'re"", 'poorly-created', 'characters', 'mere', 'vehicles', 'unfolding', 'hitman', 'angst', 'are', 'mirrors', 'man', 'presumably', 'wish', 'could', 'become.What', 'like', 'though', 'killer', 'probably', 'see', 'world', 'way', 'ultimate', 'shallowness', 'movie', 'emotionally-stunted', 'point', 'view', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'hard', 'tell', 'deliberate', 'choice', 'part', 'filmmaker', 'equally', 'shallow', 'thus', 'making', 'movie', 'pretentious', 'failure', 'felt', 'first', 'viewing']",N/A

We are introduced to George Clooney in a cabin with his woman. When they are getting ready to leave and go out into the winter snow, he sees some sharpshooters (apparently there to send him to meet his maker) and shoots them dead. He also shoots his woman in the head.2. Later, he has to go to Italy to hide out.3. He makes friends with a priest there. (I guess this was taking him in the direction of Redemption.)4. Clooney's character also seems to have a real taste for hookers. So, over one of his many visits to pay-for-play houses he finds one hooker that he particularly likes and gives her Oral Pleasure. (Sure, I bet *that's* never happened to her before. I sure can see why that would be enough to make a girl fall in love and leave the hooking business after a single visit.)5. The agent/ broker who has been sending him places also seems to have hired a woman to kill Clooney's character after he delivered a gun to her that he thought that he was making for someone else but that she actually was going to use to kill him. (It comes out that she is working for Clooney's Agent-Broker).6. Clooney meets the Hooker Girlfriend at some place, and his Gun Customer finds him and puts his head into the crosshairs. After his Would-be asssassin stands there looking at him and his girlfriend for about 45 minutes. At minute #46, god-only-knows who shoots her in the head and Clooney goes up to her vantage point and finds that she is still breathing (with half of her head missing) long enough to tell him that his Agent-Broker is the one who hired him (as if he couldn't figure that out when people came all the way to this obscure Italian village to kill him).7. As he is fleeing the scene (where no police come in spite of enough gunfire to attract at least some attention), Clooney walks away. Behind him is the Agent-Broker who raises the gun to shoot him, but Clooney (somehow) knows that he is there and turns around and shoots him dead. Then Clooney gets into the car and drives away (again, no police).8. As he is driving toward the location at which he told the Hooker Girlfriend to meet him, we find out that he has been hit. (Seems that he didn't know until after driving away for a few miles). He sees the hooker while driving and dies behind the steering whille.This is one of the silliest movies that I've ever seen.  Plot details that are left unanswered. (Who did Clooney work for? Why was his Agent-Broker a double dealer? Why did he shoot his first woman in the head? How were there never any police anywhere at any time useful? Things that just come out nowhere.) Rauchy sex scenes that didn't do much for the plot (this *was* supposed to be a thriller, after all).I can only guess that Clooney wanted to see how much his acting could save/carry a desperate/ lashed-together plot. (There has to be at least one rational reason that he would put his name on this rubbish.)Thank God for pirated DVDs, because I would have needed to be put in restraints if I'd paid the price of a movie ticket to see this film.",1,What was this about?

1310308,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B002ZG993Q,magellan,"[2, 3]","This is a thoughtful and well done movie and an atypical role for Clooney, who took a risk in doing it since he usually does more admirable or at least sympathetic characters. But Clooney plays a cold-blooded hit man who is not above killing close friends if he has to, so there's no doubt he's a bad guy here. With fine acting, a very minimal and understated script, a beautiful setting and cinematography, and an unusual story, one wonders why all the negative reviews. But the movie is more about the personal relationships Clooney develops with the townspeople rather then another James Bond or Bourne Identity spy thriller.Among these relationships the most interesting one is with the older priest, who befriends Clooney when he first arrives in town. The priest is no fool, and suspects Clooney isn't who he appears to be (Clooney claims he is a photographer), especially since after Clooney arrives, occasionally outsiders start turning up dead in an otherwise sleepy little Italian mountain town.But getting back to the the negative reviews problem, no doubt many people were expecting a more dramatic action flick due to the marketing hype, and were disappointed. The film received a general release from Focus Films which it wasn't suited for in this country, and should have just played in the art theaters. The film's slow but deliberate pacing didn't help, and a good deal of the dialog is in Italian. Overall the film just has a more European, artsy feel to it.So this is a different type of hit man movie, more an intimate character study rather than your typical action flick. In some ways it's very reminiscent of ""Destiny of a Spy,"" a now obscure movie from 1969 that starred Lorne Green as a Russian agent and killer.

1310312,A129YBX5BVNW2,B002ZG993Q,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 2]","Bought ""The American"" on BLU RAY today on the strength of some good reviews, but mother of God is it slow - even tedious. You know you're in trouble when the 10-minute ""Making Of"" is more entertaining than the entire film itself.So why watch it at all - let alone suffer it the whole way through? The answer of course is George Clooney. Since ""Three Kings"" and particularly ""Michael Clayton"" (see separate review), it's become obvious to movie lovers everywhere that gorgeous George is more than a pretty face - and given material he can get his teeth into, he's a top-notch actor. He's again superlative in ""The American"" - a brave (no make-up), restrained and almost colder-than-Hell performance that keeps you glued to the screen - even if it feels like forty minutes have passed without anything actually happening.Clooney plays Jack - an assassin, a mechanic, a man who can also makes weapons that will skillfully deal out death someplace else. Jack's not afraid to pop a slug or two into a lover's back if needs be. And an event in Sweden forces him to do just that - so he must contact a man in Italy that he trusts. This man sends him out of Rome in a plain car to a small town up in the Italian hills to hold up while things get 'sorted out'. And on it goes until 'they' eventually catch up with Jack and his newfound connections in the peaceful hamlet - a growing relationship with a local woman that may even offer him redemption...On BLU RAY the picture quality is almost surreally beautiful. Corbijn has a very stylized way of filming - lots of side profiles of faces, a man sat in a caf&eacute; with the night street lit up outside like a Hopper painting - the Italian hills and buildings looking almost as arid as Spain or Portugal rather than lush - giving the feel of edginess, sparse, almost hollow - like his character. There's silence almost all of the time too adding a sense of danger to quite ordinary scenes. Close-ups are superbly lit and intimate - making Clooney's almost expressionless performance all the more chilling...But unfortunately, most of this good stuff is washed away by some staggeringly stupid plot bits - an American in an empty town like this would stick out like a sore thumb and have local tongues wagging (especially one who looks like George Clooney). The most sexually exciting and gorgeous woman in the entire town (who would have every red-blooded Italian male pursuing her like a pack of rabid dogs) turns out to be a prostitute (great stroke of luck for George there). She is - yes you have guessed it - a tart with a heart. There are completely unnecessary sex scenes with Violante Placido that linger on her lovely truepenny bits way too long. And again down by the river - she gets her top off once more. It's gratuitous stuff than irritates rather than titillates. There's a shooting match in this tiny town one night and a very destructive car chase (with a dead body left in the wreck), but no one mentions this the next day - no Police check. The elderly town priest befriends him, but may have a past too - so he does what any Italian priest would do - he doesn't rat out the killer (give me a break). And who wants Jack dead anyway or why - no one seems to bother telling you. So as you can imagine, all of this style over substance makes it difficult to care. Even the film's name seems lazy and oddly out of place. And then it all ends with a very clich&eacute;d image that leaves you feeling a little cheated...""The American"" is not a bad film - it just promises more than it delivers. And you can't help but feel that with a cleverer script, it could have been genius.Yet on the strength of ""Control"" and this, I feel certain that Anton Corbijn will one day deliver exactly that...",3,"""...We All Have Secrets...What's Yours Jack?""",1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,3747,"['Bought', 'American', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'today', 'strength', 'good', 'reviews', 'mother', 'God', 'slow', 'even', 'tedious', 'know', ""'re"", 'trouble', 'when', '10-minute', 'Making', 'more', 'entertaining', 'entire', 'film', 'itself.So', 'why', 'watch', 'let', 'alone', 'suffer', 'whole', 'way', 'answer', 'course', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Three', 'Kings', 'particularly', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'see', 'separate', 'review', 'become', 'obvious', 'movie', 'lovers', 'everywhere', 'gorgeous', 'George', 'more', 'pretty', 'face', 'given', 'material', 'can', 'get', 'teeth', 'top-notch', 'actor', 'again', 'superlative', 'American', 'brave', 'make-up', 'restrained', 'almost', 'colder-than-Hell', 'performance', 'glued', 'screen', 'even', 'forty', 'minutes', 'have', 'passed', 'anything', 'actually', 'plays', 'Jack', 'assassin', 'mechanic', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'also', 'weapons', 'will', 'skillfully', 'deal', 'out', 'death', 'someplace', 'else', 'Jack', 'not', 'afraid', 'pop', 'slug', 'two', 'lover', 'back', 'needs', 'be', 'event', 'Sweden', 'forces', 'do', 'just', 'so', 'must', 'contact', 'man', 'Italy', 'man', 'Rome', 'plain', 'car', 'small', 'town', 'up', 'Italian', 'hills', 'hold', 'up', 'things', 'get', ""'sorted"", 'out', ""'they"", 'eventually', 'catch', 'up', 'Jack', 'newfound', 'connections', 'peaceful', 'hamlet', 'growing', 'relationship', 'local', 'woman', 'may', 'even', 'offer', 'redemption', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'picture', 'quality', 'almost', 'surreally', 'beautiful', 'Corbijn', 'very', 'stylized', 'way', 'filming', 'lots', 'side', 'profiles', 'man', 'sat', 'caf', 'eacute', 'night', 'street', 'lit', 'up', 'Hopper', 'painting', 'Italian', 'hills', 'buildings', 'looking', 'almost', 'as', 'arid', 'Spain', 'Portugal', 'rather', 'lush', 'giving', 'feel', 'edginess', 'sparse', 'almost', 'hollow', 'character', 'silence', 'almost', 'time', 'too', 'adding', 'sense', 'danger', 'quite', 'ordinary', 'scenes', 'Close-ups', 'are', 'superbly', 'lit', 'intimate', 'making', 'Clooney', 'almost', 'expressionless', 'performance', 'more', 'chilling', 'unfortunately', 'most', 'good', 'stuff', 'washed', 'away', 'staggeringly', 'stupid', 'plot', 'bits', 'American', 'empty', 'town', 'would', 'stick', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'have', 'local', 'tongues', 'wagging', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'George', 'Clooney', 'most', 'sexually', 'exciting', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'entire', 'town', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'red-blooded', 'Italian', 'male', 'pursuing', 'pack', 'rabid', 'dogs', 'out', 'be', 'prostitute', 'great', 'stroke', 'luck', 'George', 'yes', 'have', 'guessed', 'tart', 'heart', 'are', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Violante', 'Placido', 'linger', 'lovely', 'truepenny', 'bits', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'again', 'down', 'river', 'top', 'off', 'once', 'more', 'gratuitous', 'stuff', 'rather', 'titillates', 'shooting', 'match', 'tiny', 'town', 'one', 'night', 'very', 'destructive', 'car', 'chase', 'dead', 'body', 'left', 'wreck', 'one', 'mentions', 'next', 'day', 'Police', 'check', 'elderly', 'town', 'priest', 'may', 'have', 'past', 'too', 'so', 'what', 'Italian', 'priest', 'would', 'do', ""n't"", 'rat', 'out', 'killer', 'give', 'break', 'who', 'Jack', 'dead', 'anyway', 'why', 'one', 'bother', 'telling', 'So', 'can', 'imagine', 'style', 'substance', 'difficult', 'care', 'Even', 'film', 'name', 'lazy', 'oddly', 'place', 'then', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'image', 'feeling', 'little', 'cheated', 'American', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'cleverer', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'genius.Yet', 'strength', 'Control', 'feel', 'certain', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'deliver', 'exactly']",N/A
1310313,A36EW68H08UOCS,B002ZG993Q,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[2, 2]","The American features George Clooney and an excellent unknown European cast, but the screenplay has been stripped of backstory, context, and most of the things that a viewer needs to care about a film.  I'm guessing the filmmaker despises films that are full of out of context exposition (the kind of dialogue that is ridiculed in the animated ""The Incredibles""  - where villains monologue rather than doing away with their foe, giving the hero time to counter-attack and get away from the villain.)  ""The American"" moves along without exposition.  I don't mind if a movie requires me to use my own intelligence and imagination to ""fill in the missing parts"", but this film doesn't add enough to make it clear that it is worth my time to do so.Clooney plays Jack... or perhaps Edward.  We're shown that he is a skilled killer, and that ""the Swedes"" are on his trail.  Jack answers to Pavel, played by Johan Leysen, but we're not told or shown why, or Pavel's place in the universe.  Are they mercenaries?  Spies affiliated with governments?  Corporate or mafia hitmen?  We don't know.  We only know ""Jack"" is a bad dude, and Pavel is his boss.Jack goes from undercover in Sweden to Italy, where he hides out in Abruzzo, one of those scenic medieval towns built into the side of a mountain.  He is befriended by Paolo Bonacelli as Father Benedetto, a priest who knows when a man has something to hide.  The Father has secrets of his own.Relationships  are deadly disasters for Jack, and Pavel warns him not to make any friends in his new hideout.  ""I thought you had learned that by now,"" Pavel admonishes Jack after a lady friend dies in Jack's wake in an early scene.Jack tries to comply, making human contact only with the Priest and Prostitutes.  He tells a hooker ""you don't have to act for me - I'm here for my pleasure, not yours.""Pavel sends an emissary with a new job for Jack - to build an assassin's weapon with a silencer, the range of a rifle and the speed of a machine gun.  These scenes were superficially interesting, but without context narrative tension is not generated.  Jack doesn't care what the gun will be used for - only that he has the assignment.  Since he didn't seem to care - I didn't either.It is worth mentioning that Violante Placido is good as Clara, a prostitute who doesn't know about Jack's life.  Clara seems to become genuinely interested in Jack, but since assassins are sent one after another to kill Jack, you share Jack's paranoia that Clara may only be an employee of Jack's nameless enemies.The actual narrative tension is generated because Jack, with a job that absolutely cannot allow human relationships, is only human.  In his world everyone is suspect - someone who could possibly have been sent to kill him.  Can Jack find love?  With the rest of the movie so coldly methodical it is worth asking: do we care?",3,George Clooney - Death Technician,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,2859,"['American', 'features', 'George', 'Clooney', 'excellent', 'unknown', 'European', 'cast', 'screenplay', 'been', 'stripped', 'backstory', 'context', 'most', 'things', 'viewer', 'care', 'film', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'filmmaker', 'films', 'are', 'full', 'context', 'exposition', 'kind', 'dialogue', 'ridiculed', 'animated', 'Incredibles', 'where', 'villains', 'monologue', 'rather', 'doing', 'away', 'foe', 'giving', 'hero', 'time', 'counter-attack', 'get', 'away', 'villain', 'American', 'moves', 'exposition', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'movie', 'use', 'own', 'intelligence', 'imagination', 'fill', 'missing', 'parts', 'film', ""n't"", 'add', 'enough', 'make', 'clear', 'worth', 'time', 'do', 'so.Clooney', 'plays', 'Jack', 'perhaps', 'Edward', ""'re"", 'shown', 'skilled', 'killer', 'Swedes', 'are', 'trail', 'Jack', 'answers', 'Pavel', 'played', 'Johan', 'Leysen', ""'re"", 'not', 'told', 'shown', 'why', 'Pavel', 'place', 'universe', 'Are', 'mercenaries', 'Spies', 'affiliated', 'governments', 'Corporate', 'mafia', 'hitmen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'only', 'know', 'Jack', 'bad', 'dude', 'Pavel', 'boss.Jack', 'undercover', 'Sweden', 'Italy', 'where', 'out', 'Abruzzo', 'one', 'scenic', 'medieval', 'towns', 'built', 'side', 'mountain', 'befriended', 'Paolo', 'Bonacelli', 'Father', 'Benedetto', 'priest', 'who', 'when', 'man', 'something', 'hide', 'Father', 'secrets', 'own.Relationships', 'are', 'deadly', 'disasters', 'Jack', 'Pavel', 'not', 'make', 'friends', 'new', 'hideout', 'thought', 'had', 'learned', 'now', 'Pavel', 'admonishes', 'Jack', 'lady', 'friend', 'Jack', 'wake', 'early', 'scene.Jack', 'tries', 'comply', 'making', 'human', 'contact', 'only', 'Priest', 'Prostitutes', 'hooker', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'act', ""'m"", 'here', 'pleasure', 'not', 'yours', 'Pavel', 'emissary', 'new', 'job', 'Jack', 'build', 'assassin', 'weapon', 'silencer', 'range', 'rifle', 'speed', 'machine', 'gun', 'scenes', 'were', 'superficially', 'interesting', 'context', 'narrative', 'tension', 'not', 'generated', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'gun', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'only', 'assignment', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'did', ""n't"", 'either.It', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Violante', 'Placido', 'good', 'Clara', 'prostitute', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'Jack', 'life', 'Clara', 'become', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'Jack', 'assassins', 'are', 'sent', 'one', 'kill', 'Jack', 'share', 'Jack', 'paranoia', 'Clara', 'may', 'only', 'be', 'employee', 'Jack', 'nameless', 'enemies.The', 'actual', 'narrative', 'tension', 'generated', 'Jack', 'job', 'absolutely', 'can', 'not', 'allow', 'human', 'relationships', 'only', 'human', 'world', 'everyone', 'suspect', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'been', 'sent', 'kill', 'Can', 'Jack', 'find', 'love', 'rest', 'movie', 'so', 'coldly', 'methodical', 'worth', 'asking', 'do', 'care']",N/A

George Clooney plays Jack, an American hit man who relocates from Sweden to Italy after an attempt is made on his life. Jack decides to take on one last assignment before retiring. While in Italy, he falls for Clara (Violante Placido), a local prostitute he's been keeping company with. Eventually Jack figures out that he's still a target, and his miserable existence comes to a predictable end.I really wanted to like this movie. Clooney is fantastic, as always, and the film features beautiful (and sometimes creepy) scenes from the Italian countryside. Although the audience sympathizes with Jack, we really don't know anything about his past: what led him to this career, what he's been through, etc. Some additional personal information on the character would have been interesting.

However, the film gains in interest as Clooney begins to wonder just who and what he can trust. Are supposedly friendly people gunning for him, or is his paranoia working overtime?""The American"" is a throwback to the paranoid thrillers of the 1970s, featuring antiheroes with mysterious pasts and bleak futures. It has several redeeming features; Paolo Bonacelli gives an interesting performance as an elderly, world-weary priest, and Martin Ruhe captures some glorious photography of the Italian countryside and of the naked flesh of Violante Placido, an actress with the same ripe beauty as the young Isabella Rossellini.

This is a one time through movie. I don't care for that. Clooney is ill at ease the entire time, and this doesn't suit him. He's at his best in a movie like Michael Clayton (where he played the law firm's fixer).This movie was a fair way to pass some time, but it wasn't a ""wow"". Any time spent with Clooney is decent, but I prefer him in roles like ""Up in the Air"" where we see him play off his true and believable character flaws. It's not fun to see Clooney so distracted. He's a smooth one and we rely upon him to show us that cool that just rolls off of him like water. Watching Clooney in a constant distressed and nearly defeated state throughout the film is unnerving. It would make for fantastic acting only if it were believable and desirable.

This role is no different.  Clooney plays Jack, an assassin on the run across Europe.  As others are trying to kill him, Jack finds his way to Rome, Italy and eventually in a small town, tucked away in the mountain.  Jack keeps to himself and spends days surrounded with his daily routine of exercise, book readings about butterflies and visits to a local brothel.  He is also tasked to prepare a custom weapon for his female colleague, and he approaches such task with knowledge and dedication.As Jack realizes that his cover is blown, he is trying to determine his next step.  We start to wonder if Jack is loosing his edge, or if he is gaining access to his long repressed humanity.  Slowly, Jack is determined to find his own path to redemption by retiring from the business and starting over.  It is the violent ending that shatters this story and reminds us that life is short, pretty as a butterfly and often times transformative even if transformation happens too late.There are some beautiful European actresses in this film, all classical beauties.  But I truly enjoyed film's slow pace and director's relish in storytelling.  Movie is apparently made after one of the Martin Booth's books.

1310366,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B002ZG993Q,Sean Curley,"[20, 24]","George Clooney's latest film, directed by a former music video director Anton Corbijn, is a film that demonstrates effective use of star power: it's unlikely this film would have gotten any attention (and it's still unlikely to be anything huge) without the presence of the King of Hollywood. Clooney's been willing to loan out his starpower to low-profile films in the past, and he does so again here.  This is a slow-burn story more interested in character interiors than ""Bourne Identity""-style action sequences (though it is not devoid of action), one that will probably divide audiences.  But if you're interested in that sort of film, this has a lot to recommend.  Spoilers follow.The film opens with a prologue in snowy Sweden, where Jack (Clooney) is cottage-going.  There's a twist here that has been spoiled in some reviews, but is most effective when you don't know about it, so I'll refrain from saying anything.  The key is that it sends our assassin title character on a trip to a small Italian town to await his next assignment from his boss, Pavel (Johan Leysen).  Soon, a new assignment arrives, in the form of assistance to another assassin (Thekla Reuten), and legacies of his last mission also begin to appear.  Whiile there Jack ponders the state of his life, sort-of-befriends a priest (Paolo Bonacelli), and starts to fall in love with a really, really luscious prostitute (Violante Placido).It's familiar material, but it's played well. The director knows how to use the camera effectively, positioning it in ways that keep the audience on guard for something about to happen.  If I came away with a single impression, it was a strong desire to visit the town in which this was filmed, because it looks stunning.  Clooney really dials down his charisma here (like he did in ""Syriana""), and gives an effective performance. The other actors, mainly Italians, are all effective, particularly Placido, who really sells the idea that our lead character would want to give up his old lifestyle to live with her (and she's very attractive - this is a movie prostitute who actually takes her clothes off). The mark of a good movie is when they can really interest you in the mechanics of the character's profession: we get some long sequences of Clooney at work on his guns, and it's interesting to watch (particularly constructing a sound supressor out of parts from an auto shop).Recommended.",4,An effective character piece that will probably divide thriller fans.,1283472000,"09 3, 2010",2010,2410,"['George', 'Clooney', 'latest', 'film', 'directed', 'former', 'music', 'video', 'director', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'film', 'effective', 'use', 'star', 'power', 'unlikely', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'attention', 'still', 'unlikely', 'be', 'anything', 'huge', 'presence', 'King', 'Hollywood', 'Clooney', 'been', 'willing', 'loan', 'out', 'starpower', 'low-profile', 'films', 'past', 'so', 'again', 'here', 'slow-burn', 'story', 'more', 'interested', 'character', 'interiors', 'Bourne', 'Identity', '-style', 'action', 'sequences', 'not', 'devoid', 'action', 'one', 'will', 'probably', 'divide', 'audiences', ""'re"", 'interested', 'sort', 'film', 'lot', 'recommend', 'Spoilers', 'follow.The', 'film', 'prologue', 'snowy', 'Sweden', 'where', 'Jack', 'Clooney', 'cottage-going', 'twist', 'here', 'been', 'spoiled', 'reviews', 'most', 'effective', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'so', ""'ll"", 'refrain', 'saying', 'anything', 'key', 'assassin', 'title', 'character', 'trip', 'small', 'Italian', 'town', 'await', 'next', 'assignment', 'boss', 'Pavel', 'Johan', 'Leysen', 'Soon', 'new', 'assignment', 'arrives', 'form', 'assistance', 'assassin', 'Thekla', 'Reuten', 'legacies', 'last', 'mission', 'also', 'begin', 'appear', 'Jack', 'state', 'life', 'priest', 'Paolo', 'Bonacelli', 'fall', 'love', 'really', 'really', 'luscious', 'prostitute', 'Violante', 'Placido', '.It', 'familiar', 'material', 'played', 'well', 'director', 'how', 'use', 'camera', 'effectively', 'positioning', 'ways', 'keep', 'audience', 'guard', 'something', 'happen', 'came', 'away', 'single', 'impression', 'was', 'strong', 'desire', 'visit', 'town', 'was', 'filmed', 'stunning', 'Clooney', 'really', 'down', 'charisma', 'here', 'did', 'Syriana', 'effective', 'performance', 'other', 'actors', 'mainly', 'Italians', 'are', 'effective', 'particularly', 'Placido', 'who', 'really', 'idea', 'lead', 'character', 'would', 'want', 'give', 'up', 'old', 'lifestyle', 'live', 'very', 'attractive', 'movie', 'prostitute', 'who', 'actually', 'clothes', 'off', 'mark', 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'can', 'really', 'interest', 'mechanics', 'character', 'profession', 'get', 'long', 'sequences', 'Clooney', 'work', 'guns', 'interesting', 'watch', 'particularly', 'constructing', 'sound', 'supressor', 'parts', 'auto', 'shop', '.Recommended']",N/A

Do not read this review if you do not want to read the spoiler.Firstly, I misunderstood the film advertisement and initially mistook this film to be an action/adventure thriller.  So there was an initial disappointment, but I got over it and for the most part was moderately entertained by the tragic romance & drama involving the burnt out hitman/arms customizer (George Clooney) who longs for comfort through friendship & romance which is forbidden in his line of work.What nearly ruined this film for me was the unnecessarily elaborate climatic scene where the the female assassin who is contracted to kill Clooney's character is mortally wounded by her employer (Clooney's handler) when the handler decides he's going to kill Clooney's character himself.  Why?  Why hire an assassin in the first place, if you are going to try to do the job yourself? It seems to me, that practicality would dictate allowing the assassin to do her job. The ending is inexplicable and overly elaborate just so the film can portray the handler's treachery and to have a poignant and sad ending where ""the American"" can meet his lover one last time before he dies at their secret meeting place.It could have been a better movie, if the storyline provided a more logical execution of the ending, but as is, I have to give it a ""3"".",3,The American - Anticlimatic - ***Spoiler Beware***,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,1346,"['review', 'spoiler', 'Do', 'not', 'read', 'review', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'read', 'spoiler.Firstly', 'misunderstood', 'film', 'advertisement', 'initially', 'mistook', 'film', 'be', 'action/adventure', 'thriller', 'was', 'initial', 'disappointment', 'got', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'moderately', 'entertained', 'tragic', 'romance', 'drama', 'involving', 'burnt', 'hitman/arms', 'customizer', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'comfort', 'friendship', 'romance', 'forbidden', 'line', 'work.What', 'nearly', 'ruined', 'film', 'was', 'unnecessarily', 'elaborate', 'climatic', 'scene', 'where', 'female', 'assassin', 'who', 'contracted', 'kill', 'Clooney', 'character', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'employer', 'Clooney', 'handler', 'when', 'handler', 'going', 'kill', 'Clooney', 'character', 'Why', 'Why', 'hire', 'assassin', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'going', 'try', 'do', 'job', 'practicality', 'would', 'dictate', 'allowing', 'assassin', 'do', 'job', 'ending', 'inexplicable', 'overly', 'elaborate', 'just', 'so', 'film', 'can', 'portray', 'handler', 'treachery', 'have', 'poignant', 'sad', 'ending', 'where', 'American', 'can', 'meet', 'lover', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'secret', 'meeting', 'place.It', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'storyline', 'provided', 'more', 'logical', 'execution', 'ending', 'have', 'give', '3']",N/A

1310369,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B002ZG993Q,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 1]","(SPOILERS) Recently viewed it again and don't remember why I bought it.  I think it's because George Clooney is good in it, though I disliked the story.  One of the opening sequences is George Clooney's character shooting his friend and lover in the back - you don't often see a movie star shooting a woman in the back, so I liked that the film made it crystal clear from the beginning that the George Clooney character was doomed.  Now it's coming back to me, I think it's a morality tale, live by the sword, die by the sword, at the end, the lead had plenty of money and a beautiful woman who loved him and he died just as a decent life was within his reach.  So, though I disliked the story (I hated the violence against the woman character at the story's beginning and it colored the entire story for me in a negative way), I think it was told well, i.e., told within a morality frame Americans like me like.

He started that job because he loved the music of Joy Division which led to his first proper film in 2007, Control. It dealt with the life of lead singer Ian Curtis. This is his first feature that has nothing to do with music.It's not what the average viewer would expect.The American is about Jack (Clooney), who kills people for a living. In the first few minutes, we see him in action as people try to kill him in Sweden. He relocates to Italy for what he says will be his last job.One of Jack's ""weaknesses"" is that he forms friendships instead of staying aloof while he is working on a hit.This is not an action movie. There are two or three brief action sequences, but that's not the point of this movie. If you're looking for another Bourne movie or Taken, look elsewhere. The American is a more contemplative look at the life of a killer. We see extended sequences with no dialogue and Clooney is shown thinking. We see his paranoia and get an idea of what it would be like to be in his shoes.Despite the warnings of his boss, Jack makes friends in Italy. Will they lead to his eventual death?This movie will undoubtedly be too slow for the majority of viewers. I found it refreshing. It's intelligent for the most part and I was drawn in to the story. One of the things I liked about it was that Clooney didn't rely on his smirk and charm routine. He played this one seriously and it was the better for it.The ending is deliberately ambiguous. Does Jack live or die? We can't be sure.The cinematography is excellent. The beauty of the Italian mountains is shown frequently. The picture quality is also good, making the panoramic shots very effective.This Blu-ray presentation is recommended for fans of the film, or people that enjoy slow-paced stories that require a bit of thought to fully appreciate.",4,"Not an action thriller, but a good look inside the mind of a killer",1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,2264,"['Directed', 'Anton', 'CorbijnStarring', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Violante', 'Placido', 'Paolo', 'Bonacelli', 'Thekla', 'Reuten105', 'minutesVideo', 'Video', 'codec', 'VC-1Video', 'resolution', '1080pAspect', 'ratio', '2.35:1Original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.39:1Audio', 'English', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1French', 'DTS', '5.1Spanish', 'DTS', '5.1Subtitles', 'English', 'SDH', 'French', 'SpanishRated', 'R', 'nudity', 'sexuality.Anton', 'Corbijn', 'usually', 'music', 'videos', 'used', 'work', 'photographer', 'New', 'Musical', 'Express', 'started', 'job', 'loved', 'music', 'Joy', 'Division', 'led', 'first', 'proper', 'film', '2007', 'Control', 'life', 'lead', 'singer', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'first', 'feature', 'nothing', 'do', 'music.It', 'not', 'what', 'average', 'viewer', 'would', 'expect.The', 'American', 'Jack', 'Clooney', 'who', 'people', 'living', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'see', 'action', 'people', 'try', 'kill', 'Sweden', 'Italy', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'job.One', 'Jack', 'weaknesses', 'friendships', 'instead', 'staying', 'aloof', 'working', 'hit.This', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'are', 'two', 'three', 'brief', 'action', 'sequences', 'not', 'point', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Bourne', 'movie', 'Taken', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'American', 'more', 'contemplative', 'look', 'life', 'killer', 'see', 'extended', 'sequences', 'dialogue', 'Clooney', 'shown', 'thinking', 'see', 'paranoia', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'shoes.Despite', 'warnings', 'boss', 'Jack', 'friends', 'Italy', 'Will', 'lead', 'eventual', 'death', 'movie', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'too', 'slow', 'majority', 'viewers', 'found', 'refreshing', 'intelligent', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'drawn', 'story', 'One', 'things', 'liked', 'was', 'Clooney', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'smirk', 'charm', 'routine', 'played', 'one', 'seriously', 'was', 'better', 'it.The', 'ending', 'deliberately', 'ambiguous', 'Does', 'Jack', 'live', 'die', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure.The', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'beauty', 'Italian', 'mountains', 'shown', 'frequently', 'picture', 'quality', 'also', 'good', 'making', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'very', 'effective.This', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'recommended', 'fans', 'film', 'people', 'enjoy', 'slow-paced', 'stories', 'require', 'bit', 'thought', 'fully', 'appreciate']",N/A

1310380,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B002ZG993Q,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[1, 1]","I recall reading or hearing somewhere that ""The American"" isn't quite what you expect.  I never gave that much thought until I watch the movie.  The promos for this movie depict it as an action and/or suspense film.  This is somewhat misleading and why trailers/previews at times can either praise a film or condemn them before they are released.  I can say that I really, really enjoyed this motion picture.I am not going to rehash plot detail, because many other reviewers have done a nice job of providing a summary of this flick.  In contrast, I will betray my former statement by saying George Clooney plays a Jack, a hit man who finds pseudo sanctuary in Castel del Monte after a situation of his turns sour in Sweden.  Jack escapes Sweden and after speaking to an old contact ends up in Castel del Monte.  There is more to the movie, such as the Swedish hunting Jack, the duplicity Jack has towards his lifestyle, theology, romance, deception and redemption.This movie isn't fast paced and is not action packed.  It is very minimal in nature and in many ways mimics an art house film.  I found this refreshing because it wasn't a CGI fest and an unintelligent piece of cinema.  There are lush shots of the landscape, images are framed almost like ""still life"" and there are periods of time where there is little dialogue.  I wasn't very surprised by these elements since this movie was directed by Anton Corbijn.Anton Corbijn has spent most of his career taking photographs and directing music videos.  The former and the latter bless the creative process of this movie.  This would explain the artist cinematography, framing and little dialogue.  There are two scenes in particular that imitate videos that Corbijn has directed one with U2 and one with Depeche Mode.  Corbijn is the creative director for both of these bands and has been so for twenty-five plus years.As for the acting, I felt George Clooney provided a solid performance as an ambivalent hit man questioning his ""purpose"".  Clooney provides most of his acting without and/or little dialogue, which I felt was captivating.  Violante Placido was very good as Clara, the prostitute that Jack becomes involved with.

But Clooney's charms are absent in this thriller that pits this deep CIA operative wanting to find love and leave the covert life of lies and murder that he leads.  You wonder if he can ever find it when, early on in the film, you see him shoot a beautiful (age appropriate) woman down after protecting her from a sniper out in the white wilderness of what I think was the Netherlands.When he takes what is to be his final assignment (final on his own terms) and falls in love with a town prostitute somewhere in Italy he has to stay one step ahead of a contracted assassin in a bit of paranoid cat-and-mouse gamesmanship, never certain if and when he is going to be betrayed by his employers, but knowing enough that he is likely too and that the assassin he's been put in contact with might just be there to off him.  The film is quiet and Clooney is a force of tight-lipped brooding; he plays this well enough because he's simply a great actor but this script doesn't let his charisma and easy manner ooze through.  It's not his fault; he does his job well.  It's just that the movie is slow and quiet and never lets our protagonist (Clooney as Jack ""the American"") breathe and show us that he has a hope of living happily ever after; after all, we saw him shoot his lady friend early on in the film and we knew that he cared for her.

No, here you will not see Clooney shooting out any windows and then jumping through them. The pacing is slow, but persistently tense. The filmmakers and actors have managed to pull off an exciting espionage thriller without having to rely on the over-saturation of action sequences. Action sequences are only peppered about but are well done. What I thought was kind of cool was that it's a great character study, yet without a lot of character development... we don't know them, they're all kind of mysterious, yet we are interested in them, we're rooting for the lovers (the love story backdrop is very, very well done). The only familiar face in the movie is Clooney, I'm not a Ra Ra Clooney fanatic but let me tell you his acting here is superb. The performances of the entire supporting cast are also superb.

If you are looking for a typical Hollywood thriller with chase scenes and the obligatory love triangle, this movie is not for you. The American throws all the cliches out the window. The best way I can describe this movie is to use analogies borrowed from the field of painting. If you are familiar with the portrait painter John Singer Sargent you will have an upper leg on understanding this review. The American is the equivalent to cinematic impressionism. The Sargent of filmmaking, bordering on minimalism. This movie appears, on its surface, to be very simple. And that's its intent. It's simplicity is its beauty. The story is filmed and told with incredible economy of means. Each stroke is a drawing stroke and has a purpose. The movie simplifies every detail. No shot is overdone. Each line of dialogue has a purpose. There are no overdone and cliche chase scenes. Its simplistic nature is its charm. This is a very intelligent thriller. Thematically perhaps not original but this movie's beauty is its construction. The priest tells Clooney's character that Americans believe they can escape their past. This in a nutshell is what the movie is about. Clooney attempts to escape his past and his history - for love. But he cannot do this. It's impossible to escape the sins of his past. Great movie.

The entire first half of this movie appears absolutely pointless and unnecessary, with long scenes of Clooney doing pushups, sitting around killing time or walking around aimlessly. It's really a waste of time and film. The scenes are completely disconnected and there seems to be no plot at all. George Clooney plays a hit man who makes guns for other killers as a sideline. I guess contract killing doesn't pay as well as it used to. It's a tough economy, even for criminals. Throughout the movie, people keep trying to kill him, although we never find out why. Then suddenly, in the last half hour, the movie evolves into a love story. One minute he's telling a prostitute that he's not interested in having a conversation with her, he's only there for his pleasure, and the next minute he's planning to abandon his profession for her and run away together. We never see the transition, we're just supposed to take the director's word for it that it happens. That is a major theme in Anton Corbijn's direction, unfortunately.All of the characters in the film seem stiff, and deliver dialog like they're reading it from a teleprompter(no acting required). Also deserving a mention is the weird, creepy priest character in this film, played by Paolo Bonacelli.  He is horribly miscast in this role, which is supposed to represent Clooney's conscience.

I can't imagine why George Clooney wanted to produce this film much less star in it or what he thought the reaction of audiences to this non-story would be. The movie didn't hang together; the viewer can't develop empathy for Jack since he shows very little warmth and no redeeming human characteristics. The protagonist has no friends (one friend he did have he killed at the beginning of the film--- evidently because she witnessed him kill someone trying to kill him. According to this movie, prostitutes that ""Jack"" encounters are all young and beautiful and he doesn't need them to fake enjoyment since he is there ""to be given pleasure, not to give it"".  He portrays an unhappy, solitary, amoral sociopath who leads a miserable existence. There is very little dialogue and what dialogue is included is very confusing to follow.  The nudity and sex scenes were gratuitous and didn't seem to achieve anything other than to get an ""R"" rating to entice people who like seeing both frontal and backside female nudity and simulated sex to pay to see this film. Clooney should really refrain from showing his body without clothes on--he is very thin and his muscles are underdeveloped--certainly not the physique you would think George Clooney would have. I kept watching the film thinking it would get better and the story would finally make sense but it didn't. The film ended and I was left thinking I had wasted a perfectly good evening watching this bomb.  ""He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword"" is the moral to the story. The irony at the end is that when he has decided to quit this solitary criminal life and run off with a prostitute and start over, he is shot in a gun battle. Although he killed the other man, he dies too. You can't identify with the character and there's no sadness at his death.  There was no reason given the audience to like or care about the character. This is a low-budget film with very few actors and it should never have been made. If I had known then what I know now, I would never have rented it.

This film is similar to the ""Spaghetti Westerns"" made popular by Clint Eastwood in the 1960s, in that it has a slow moving plot, little dialogue, and highly symbolic scenes and gestures.  It is a character story with a moral.George Clooney stars as Jack, an assassin who is growing tired of his profession.  After being ambushed near a lake in Sweden, Jack flees to a remote village in Italy.  He functions with a false name, and takes what he hopes to be his last job, making an assault rifle for a colleague.Jack encounters two characters who attempt to reform him: a priest and a prostitute.  The priest, Father Benedetto, played by Paolo Bonacelli, senses that he is a criminal (a sinner who still intends to sin) but listens to him and accepts and befriends him.The prostitute, Clara, played by Violante Placido, provides him with comfort and  understanding.  Clara offers Jack unconditional love and Jack slowly falls for her.The American is a film for a few.  The typical viewer may leave during the middle of the movie or wonder why they stayed.  Those who love character studies will likely enjoy the film.  I rate this film average.",3,Not a Thriller,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,1386,"['advanced', 'advertizing', 'movie', 'wife', 'rented', 'American', 'anticipated', 'fun', 'evening', 'watching', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'occurred.The', 'American', 'not', 'thriller', 'slow', 'moving', 'crime', 'story', 'film', 'similar', 'Spaghetti', 'Westerns', 'made', 'popular', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', '1960s', 'slow', 'moving', 'plot', 'little', 'dialogue', 'highly', 'symbolic', 'scenes', 'gestures', 'character', 'story', 'moral.George', 'Clooney', 'Jack', 'assassin', 'who', 'growing', 'tired', 'profession', 'being', 'ambushed', 'lake', 'Sweden', 'Jack', 'remote', 'village', 'Italy', 'false', 'name', 'what', 'be', 'last', 'job', 'making', 'assault', 'rifle', 'colleague.Jack', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'attempt', 'reform', 'priest', 'prostitute', 'priest', 'Father', 'Benedetto', 'played', 'Paolo', 'Bonacelli', 'criminal', 'sinner', 'who', 'still', 'sin', 'accepts', 'him.The', 'prostitute', 'Clara', 'played', 'Violante', 'Placido', 'comfort', 'understanding', 'Clara', 'Jack', 'unconditional', 'love', 'Jack', 'slowly', 'her.The', 'American', 'film', 'few', 'typical', 'viewer', 'may', 'leave', 'middle', 'movie', 'wonder', 'why', 'stayed', 'who', 'love', 'character', 'studies', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'film', 'rate', 'film', 'average']",N/A

1310394,A3KF8A4ESRHPCI,B002ZG993Q,William K. Lasley,"[5, 7]","In the vein of Alfred Hitchcock, Ian Fleming and John le Carre, this story of international assassins delivers a very satisfying experience.  It's not an ""action movie.""  If your attention span is short, then watch SALT.  If you enjoy a thought-provoking tale of intrigue that keeps you guessing all the way to the very, and I do mean very, end, then THE AMERICAN is for you.  There are time-consuming sequences in the film that communicate the tedium of laying low to avoid discovery.  Unfortunately, this realism seems to have turned off some cinema-goers who expected a kinetic 007-type assault on the senses.  In THE AMERICAN, we have a drama of a paranoid lone wolf hitman who is a prisoner of his own profession, where all Europe is a place of fear and suspicion.  The movie is peppered here and there with both violence and romance.  When the action does come, it's brutal and decisive.  When sex does happen, it's raw and impactful.So settle down with a meal or ample supply of snacks and watch this really cool movie.  You'll have a ball trying to figure out who wishes Clooney's character well, and who is out to kill him.Highly recommended!",5,"Superb, Realistically-Paced Spy Drama with Surprises!",1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,1151,"['vein', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'John', 'le', 'Carre', 'story', 'international', 'assassins', 'very', 'satisfying', 'experience', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'attention', 'span', 'short', 'then', 'watch', 'SALT', 'enjoy', 'thought-provoking', 'tale', 'intrigue', 'guessing', 'way', 'very', 'do', 'mean', 'very', 'end', 'then', 'AMERICAN', 'are', 'time-consuming', 'sequences', 'film', 'communicate', 'tedium', 'laying', 'low', 'avoid', 'discovery', 'Unfortunately', 'realism', 'have', 'turned', 'off', 'cinema-goers', 'who', 'expected', 'kinetic', '007-type', 'assault', 'senses', 'THE', 'AMERICAN', 'have', 'drama', 'paranoid', 'lone', 'wolf', 'hitman', 'who', 'prisoner', 'own', 'profession', 'where', 'Europe', 'place', 'fear', 'suspicion', 'movie', 'peppered', 'here', 'there', 'violence', 'romance', 'When', 'action', 'come', 'brutal', 'decisive', 'When', 'sex', 'happen', 'raw', 'impactful.So', 'settle', 'down', 'meal', 'ample', 'supply', 'snacks', 'watch', 'really', 'cool', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'have', 'ball', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'Clooney', 'character', 'well', 'who', 'out', 'kill', 'him.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

UGH!Added to all this, there were no characters one could care about.

1310397,A1DSOF0EK9G06C,B002ZG993Q,Zarathustra,"[1, 1]","George Clooney is one of our best American actors. I like to see him taking risks by working with a European director (Anton Corbijn), who is from the Netherlands. I watch films by European directors like Michael Haneke, an Austrian director who has made a number of films that are unlike any that are made in the U.S. Haneke won two Academy Award nominations in 2009 for his German language film The White Ribbon. This year his French language film Amour has been nominated for best foreign language film.American audiences seem to prefer films that have happy endings. That is not a requirement for European audiences.I don't know much about Corbijn, but I noted that his 2008 DVD Control received a rating of 4 1/2 stars on Amazon, so I ordered it and a DVD of the Director's Series for Corbijn to find out what he has done so far.I was surprised at the low rankings here for The American. The beautiful shots of the Italian hill country alone were worth a higher ranking. I just finished watching Clooney in Syriana and Out of Sight.
