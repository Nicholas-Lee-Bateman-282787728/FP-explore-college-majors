Season 6 is my favorite because of the episode entitle God and the Universe. Most of the series provide food for thought, as they say. Some may make you wonder why you purchased the series as they are somewhat difficult to follow. That is not to say that they don't help in explaining the universe, or should I say try to explain the universe. But they don't dumb it down either. It is the segment on God and trying to identify God in the universe that for me is the most thought provoking. I'm not sure that the discussion helps any in finding definitive answers, and at points I believe it strays from the topic and becomes entangle in scientific jargon and logic. But it nevertheless pushes one to think about and even question one's beliefs....in a good way. At the end of the episode there are no answers of course, no proof, only belief both scientific and religious faith. If you get any in the series of this wonder program, I would actually begin with season 6.

1519184,AYG1U47VFZ165,B006QVRUY6,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[5, 8]","Growing up, I absolutely hated science.  It seems like it was little more than the education system's way of encouraging students to remember and recite a never-ending complex series of formulas, equations, and facts that had very little application to everyday life.  But astronomy, on the other hand, was something which always fascinated me, much in the way it does every little boy.  Hearing about the planets and their possible environments fascinated me.  Studying the constellations - the history of where they came from, what stars made them up, etc. - was a source of constant inspiration.  I knew life was ""out there"" ... only it took wildly different shapes or, at least, was broken down into all of the components the science teacher made me memorize.Given how little was actually established those forty odd years ago when I was a pup, I can't even begin to imagine how a program like the History Channel's THE UNIVERSE continues to inspire those young astronauts and astronomers of today.  Mostly, it's vivid, colorful, and impressive.  Computer graphics have never looked better - well, except maybe in some major motion picture releases - and the show makes exceptional use of the visual technology by mapping out these otherworldly places and events with cutting edge detail.  Perhaps the best use appears in ""Catastrophes That Changed the Planets,"" the episode that opens season 6 when the viewer is given a front-row-view of how ranking cataclysms changed life here and the natural environment of Mercury and Mars.Granted THE UNIVERSE stumbles at establishing strong accounts with a few of these outings - ""Ride the Comet"" vacillates understandably between fact and obvious conjecture quite a bit, as does the rampant speculation with fringe science in ""UFOs: The Real Deal"" and ""Alien Sounds"" (not about what you might think it's about) - but I felt the narrative remained strong despite a preponderance for best educated guesses.  I'll admit that I'm far more tolerant of having noted experts dishing out their various theories and hypotheses than perhaps the next person - I'm a closet conspiracy nut, too ... so THERE, Internet! - but I think that's largely because, as I've already confessed, science was never my strong suit.  Also, much of the territory covered in the second episode, ""Nemesis: the Sun's Evil"" twin, is almost entirely based on scientific guesswork, some of which is fairly regularly debunked by more `hard science' specialists.  Still, as best as I understand it, good speculation - like how the planetary catastrophes on Saturn and Jupiter `may've' looked or how survival may be accomplished on the Moon or Mars - is at the heart of good research anyway; and it's certainly near and dear to quality storytelling.  Making education entertaining ain't easy, but the producers and contributors of THE UNIVERSE have no reason to hang their heads in shame.In fact, one could make a case that THE UNIVERSE continues to work hard at surrounding fact with `fiction that may turn out to be fact over time.'  Every guess about our place in the cosmos is accompanied by three facts, and that isn't a bad ratio.  Plus, as I hope I've made clear, it all looks outstanding.Besides, check out competing theories regarding the Big Bang, and you'll see that some science still waits for a wider audience.THE UNIVERSE: THE COMPLETE SEASON SIX delivers just over ten hours of entertainment on three Blu-ray discs.  The program is produced by Flight 33 Productions for History Television Network Productions.  The DVD distribution is being handled by New Video.  As far as the `technicals' are concerned, it all looks and sounds wonderful; I had absolutely no audio problems that I've encountered with some other documentary-style features.  There are English and Spanish subtitles available, and I'm comfortable admitting I made use of the English ones on a few occasions when I didn't quite grasp what one of the experts was saying.  (Again, I'm a Geek, just not a book-smart one!)HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  Especially for junior high schools and high schools, I would think programs like THE UNIVERSE would make a stellar addition (pun intended) to their audio-visual libraries.  Science nerds - like myself - have plenty to celebrate in the continuing exploration of our greater galaxy-at-large in this production.  With state-of-the-art graphics along with guest scientists and engineers continuing their contribution to the program, I've no doubt that there's still plenty of territory to discover.  After all, the Universe is expanding, I'm told.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video and A&E; Television Networks, LLC provided me with a DVD screener

1519186,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B006QVRUY6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[47, 50]","History Channel's popular ""The Universe"" series has always been a bit of a take-it or leave-it proposition.  Detractors have long maintained that the science elements of the show were too dumbed down or that the presentations themselves tended toward speculative fiction as opposed to real information.  I don't know that, in theory, I necessarily disagree with those criticisms but (in many ways) it didn't matter for me as the show succeeded in the world of entertainment.  It's a program that looks terrific, has proposed fascinating topics, and utilized CGI to great visual affect.  Let's face it, though, if you're looking for the Season Six DVD--you're already likely a fan and you don't need me to explain the concept of the show to you!  So I won't.After a short Season Five, a lot of fans criticized that the DVD set contained only eight episodes.  Season Six is back with a customary 14 episodes.  The standard DVD set has 4 discs while the Blu-ray has 3 discs (and I might add, the Blu-ray quality looks great) for over 10 hours of programming.  I'd heard that this was the first season also shot for 3-D (like the ""7 Wonders of the Solar System"" episode from Season Five) but as there doesn't seem to be a 3-D DVD release on the books, perhaps I'm wrong.Here are the episodes included with this set:(1) Catastrophes That Changed The Planets, (2) Nemesis: The Sun's Evil Twin, (3) How the Solar System Was Made, (4) Crash Landing on Mars, (5) Worst Days on Planet Earth, (6) UFO: The Real Deal, (7) God And The Universe, (8) How Big, How Far, How Fast, (9) Alien Sounds, (10) Our Place in The Milky Way, (11) Deep Freeze, (12) Microscopic Universe, (13) Ride The Comet, and (14) When Space Changed History.As I'm a stated fan of ""The Universe,"" let me explain my three star rating (it might just as easily been 4 stars).  The longer the series has progressed, the more the topics seem to overlap.  The novelty and newness factor that made the earlier seasons so compelling has worn off a bit.  I'm still a fan, but I feel like there is a bit too much repetition in later seasons.  With the entire universe at their disposal, I think the show's creators tend to dip into very similar subject matter under different headings.  So, yes--I did enjoy these 14 episodes of Season Six but they lack some of the dynamic originality of the many of the earlier episodes.  But if you like ""The Universe,"" this is still an easy choice.
