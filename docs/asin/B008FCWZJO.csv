The book this is based on is not much better, but for a completely different reason. This film sucks on every level. The story deviates from the book, this happens with film adaptations, but in this case, the deviation is so far, it's disgusting. The cast is unbelievably bad, particularly Tyler Perry. I wish they had cast Denzel, but it wouldn't have mattered, because the story sucks. Rachel Nichols does a great job, but her character is only incidental.You'll find yourself completely disgusted by the racial stereotypes that are consistently utilized along the film. The bad guy's M.O. is clear, but his motivation is never explained, which is what makes the book slightly better. SPOILER ALERT: The inconsistency is so abhorrent, that the identity of the killer, the one who kills Alex Cross's wife, is different in the movie. From this moment, the story becomes a black hole of contradictory plot angles that eat other like a snake eating its own tail. All your left with, is the shattered remains of what could have been.

1551487,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B008FCWZJO,Chris Kennison,"[21, 27]","In a role made famous by Morgan Freeman, Tyler Perry takes over the character of Alex Cross. ""Alex Cross"" is based on a character created by writer James Patterson. Freeman played the character previously in ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider"". This movie is a prequel to the prior films. In ""Alex Cross"", Cross is a homicide detective, not yet an FBI agent. His career has yet to take off and that is somewhat the premise of the film.When a hitman's mark is left in a fancy neighborhood, tied to a bed and violently tortured, Cross is awoken in the middle of the night to investigate. There is pressure to clean up the case, being so high profile, but quickly Cross discovers that this will be no ordinary case. He has a keen eye, better than most, and his investigation leads him onto the trail of a single man who had the skill to take out three bodyguards and still eliminate his target.""Alex Cross"" is a mixed bag and will leave a mixed opinion with its audience. The script is interesting. It's always moving and there are many twists and turns. It focuses ample time on the personal connections, as well as the action. For the most part, the actions scenes are well done, especially one that occurs in a high-rise corporate building where they are saddled with the protection of a target in a safe room and are dealing with a skilled assassin. Then there are some scenes that are poorly handled with not just a shaky camera, but a frantically shaky camera. Whether it's the case or not, shaky cameras, in my opinion, are used to cover up actors who aren't good fight actors. This camera was shaking so much, the actors must have been supremely awful.I couldn't help thinking as the movie played out, that the material was better than the talent on screen and behind the camera. With the exception of Matthew Fox, the acting was lukewarm at best, and even Fox has his moments of over-the-top selling of his craziness. Lines were delivered at times with flair without justification. Perry, at one point, in an effort to be dramatic explaining the suspect they seek to his partners, turns and seems to go off to a distant place. It was disappointing to watch. I had hope that the movie would be better and that Tyler Perry would do well. In fairness, sometimes actors are given a bad rap because the directors don't do enough takes or aren't vigilant enough.""Alex Cross"" is another one of those movies that I wish would have been better. I wanted to love it and the story deserved it. Unfortunately though, the direction of the film was lackluster. Some things that should have been left for the audience to figure out were fleshed out in a short two-minute and highly unrealistic scene. After watching a film that was disappointedly acted and then enduring a hard to watch shaky camera, it was the final straw.

After seeing it in my living room, I realize I should have caught it on the big screen.While I liked ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider"", two other James Patterson-penned works that became Hollywood movies, Tyler Perry's version of the character Alex Cross in this new movie is much more realistic, or at least closer to what James Patterson was envisioning, than Morgan Freeman's version in the two earlier movies.  I'm not saying Morgan Freeman wasn't good in the roles; Freeman is a legend and excellent actor.  I'm just saying that Tyler Perry is closer to the age and physical condition of the character Patterson portrayed.Although the setting for this movie was Detroit rather than Washington D.C., ""Alex Cross"" had more of a feel of James Patterson's novels than the previous movies had.  In fact, ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider"" felt more like ""Silence of the Lambs"" in their mood and setting.Several of the critics had bashed the villain in ""Alex Cross"", played by Matthew Fox, for being too over-the-top or extreme.  I disagree.  Fox's character, based upon Picasso from Patterson's novel, was on the money.  In fact, in Patterson's books, the villains are in fact VERY over-the-top.  James Patterson, when discussing his novels, admits he doesn't write realism.  He writes excellent, fast-paced, exciting, action-packed stories that are fun to read.  And that is exactly what ""Alex Cross"" the movie felt like to me.In addition to enjoying the script written for this movie, I thought the acting was superb.  Tyler Perry and Matthew Fox are well supported by several other well known actors, including Edward Burns as Cross' partner and Cicely Tyson as Nana Mama.Bottom line: if you're a true James Patterson fan, you will of course notice differences between the books and the ""Alex Cross"" movie, but overall the differences don't make the movie bad.  Like Patterson said in a recent interview, his books and the Cross movies stand on their own.  Overall I thought ""Alex Cross"" did both Hollywood and James Patterson justice.

1551495,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B008FCWZJO,C. Sawin,"[5, 7]","Avoiding Tyler Perry like the plague has always been a rule of thumb. If you're trying to be an open-minded film critic, you still give a decent amount of films a fair chance even if you're not particularly interested in them or fall into their target audience. Just seeing trailers and TV spots alone for the Madea movies has been enough though and the best thing Perry has done up until this point was be parodied on the ""South Park"" episode ""Funnybot."" Maybe it was that mindset, never getting around to seeing ""Kiss the Girls"" or ""Along Came a Spider,"" and not having any expectations at all that made ""Alex Cross"" more entertaining than it had any right to be.Perry is going to surprise a lot of people. Alex Cross is an incredibly intelligent homicide detective; his skills are nearly unprecedented. But he's also a family man with two kids, a wife, and another kid on the way. Along with his childhood best friend and partner Tommy Kane (Edward Burns), Cross can handle pretty much anything that is thrown at him. This is his breaking point though. This is the case that pushes him over the edge. A tragic, life-changing event occurs that sends Cross into an emotional downward spiral that leads him down the path of vengeance and away from the rules of the law. Perry deserves at least some credit for portraying as much emotion as he does and is stronger during the sadder moments of the film.The sole reason you should see ""Alex Cross"" is for Matthew Fox. Fox is a highly skilled assassin with no name, but is known as ""Picasso"" for the art he leaves at the scene of the crime. He has an infatuation for using a drug called TTX, which leaves his victim's completely helpless but aware of the torture he puts them through. Fox is extremely lean and pure muscle in the film. Not only is his appearance unusual for him, but so is his performance. His body movements are so peculiar, his cold stare makes the hair on your arms stand up, and you just know something intense is about to occur whenever that vein in the middle of his forehead pops out. While Fox will probably be best known for ""Lost,"" ""Alex Cross"" is certainly a game changer for him as Picasso is one of the most memorable and chilling villains of the year.Giancarlo Esposito was really fantastic as the neat, clean, and organized druglord Gustavo ""Gus"" Fring on ""Breaking Bad."" He has such little screen time here and is mostly very forgettable, but the most amusing part about his character is that Cross lays into him about ""knowing chemists"" and demands a name for the person supplying the TTX. It seemed like a blatant homage to ""Breaking Bad,"" but is more amusing if it's just some outstanding coincidence.Everything the crime thriller has going for it is almost thrown away in the final confrontation between Cross and Picasso. It is really difficult to process just what the hell is going on during their fight scene at the abandoned movie theater. The camera movements are so sloppy, shaky, and fast moving that you can't really tell what's going on. The writing of the film also makes it seem like everyone at the police station who isn't directly involved with Cross or his team is completely incompetent. John C. McGinley as police chief Richard Brookwell is the main offender. He always wants to take charge and wants everything done his way, but in reality he's completely clueless to the task at hand.Tragic events take a completely mediocre crime thriller and turns ""Alex Cross"" into something a little more worthwhile.

1551522,AYG1U47VFZ165,B008FCWZJO,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","That about sums up not only my thoughts but also a wide array of critical assessment to Rob Cohen's take on the ALEX CROSS franchise.  What we have here is a not so much a crime procedural - as I've been told the books are - but, instead, a weirdly and unintentionally comic revenge film.  Think of it as DEATH WISH by way of literary clout.  I couldn't say how well the picture captures the spirit of the James Patterson books as I haven't read any of them, but, if this flick is any indication, I'm not all that interested either.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Detective Dr. Alex Cross (played curiously by Tyler Perry) is a renowned homicide detective and revered psychologist hot on the trail of a serial killer nicknamed `Picasso' (played by LOST's Matthew Fox).  Unfortunately, Cross gets too deeply under Picasso's skin, leading the man to shoot the detective's wife dead, which - of course - only ups the stakes as these two ""masterminds"" push one another to the edge (!!!) in this thriller.Unfortunately, there isn't much thrill in this thriller as the script postulates one silly sequence after another.  It all has something to do with the high pressures of international finance - or so we're led to believe - but those players are reduced to simply stereotypes and the actors are put the requisite, predictable pacing.  We're told (repeatedly) that Alex Cross is one of the best in the game, but yet he never quite seems to keep up with even the most basic elements of a police procedural.  (Sarcasm) Screen legend (/sarcasm) Edward Burns is along for the ride, and he gripes and bleeds accordingly.  We're reminded that he's a top investigator, as well, but don't look for him to act as such either.Therein lies the rub - when you have to tell the audience something they should see unfolding organically, then it ends up feeling illegitimate.Even worse, the killer Picasso is drawn into Detroit on a mission to (apparently) wipe out the heads of multi-national corporations, but he's given absolutely zero background nor personal history to make one understand the `hows' and `whys' of his chosen profession.  Again, we're ""told"" he's the best in the business, and we're expected to accept all of this nonsense at face value.  Apparently, it has something to do with his ""affection"" for inflicting pain - he's a scholar on the subject, he tells us.  It all ends up being tired - with utterly no payoff - and the climax between Cross and Picasso is so horribly photographed by shaky-cam you'll end up with a headache if you watch too closely.ALEX CROSS is produced by QED International, Block/Hanson, Emmett/Furla Films, and a host of others, including James Patterson Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled through Summit Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, it all looks and sounds about as high quality as it can get.  There are a handful of special features, including an audio commentary from director Cohen, a short about adapting CROSS for the screen, and some deleted scenes.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  Meh.  ""Medea Solves A Crime"" really sums this one up as there's very little substance behind a film based on a popular series of novels by James Patterson.  Some of the fault lies in Tyler Perry's inability to project any real gravitas to the seminal character of Dr. Cross, but much more blame could be put at the feet of screenwriters Marc Moss and Kerry Williamson; unfortunately, there's so much that happens in here that makes little sense or is given circumstantial history ... not enough for this discerning viewer.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Summit Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of ALEX CROSS for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",2,"Tyler Perry's ""Medea Solves A Crime!""",1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,4093,"['sums', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'thoughts', 'also', 'wide', 'array', 'critical', 'assessment', 'Rob', 'Cohen', 'take', 'ALEX', 'CROSS', 'franchise', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'crime', 'procedural', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'books', 'are', 'instead', 'weirdly', 'unintentionally', 'comic', 'revenge', 'film', 'Think', 'DEATH', 'WISH', 'way', 'literary', 'clout', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'well', 'picture', 'spirit', 'James', 'Patterson', 'books', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'flick', 'indication', ""'m"", 'not', 'interested', 'NOTE', 'following', 'review', 'will', 'contain', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'necessary', 'discussion', 'plot', 'characters', ""'re"", 'kind', 'reader', 'who', 'review', 'entirely', 'spoiler-free', 'then', ""'d"", 'encourage', 'skip', 'down', 'last', 'two', 'paragraphs', 'final', 'assessment', 'however', ""'re"", 'accepting', 'few', 'modest', 'hints', 'things', 'come', 'then', 'read', 'Detective', 'Dr.', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'played', 'curiously', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'renowned', 'homicide', 'detective', 'revered', 'psychologist', 'hot', 'trail', 'serial', 'killer', 'nicknamed', 'Picasso', 'played', 'LOST', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Unfortunately', 'Cross', 'too', 'deeply', 'Picasso', 'skin', 'leading', 'man', 'shoot', 'detective', 'wife', 'dead', 'course', 'only', 'stakes', 'two', 'masterminds', 'push', 'one', 'edge', 'thriller.Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'much', 'thrill', 'thriller', 'script', 'one', 'silly', 'sequence', 'something', 'do', 'high', 'pressures', 'international', 'finance', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe', 'players', 'are', 'reduced', 'simply', 'stereotypes', 'actors', 'are', 'put', 'requisite', 'predictable', 'pacing', ""'re"", 'told', 'repeatedly', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'one', 'best', 'game', 'yet', 'never', 'quite', 'keep', 'up', 'even', 'most', 'basic', 'elements', 'police', 'procedural', 'Sarcasm', 'Screen', 'legend', '/sarcasm', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'along', 'ride', 'accordingly', ""'re"", 'reminded', 'top', 'investigator', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'act', 'such', 'either.Therein', 'rub', 'when', 'have', 'tell', 'audience', 'something', 'should', 'see', 'unfolding', 'organically', 'then', 'up', 'feeling', 'illegitimate.Even', 'worse', 'killer', 'Picasso', 'drawn', 'Detroit', 'mission', 'apparently', 'out', 'heads', 'multi-national', 'corporations', 'given', 'absolutely', 'zero', 'background', 'personal', 'history', 'make', 'one', 'understand', 'hows', 'whys', 'chosen', 'profession', 'Again', ""'re"", 'told', 'best', 'business', ""'re"", 'expected', 'accept', 'nonsense', 'face', 'value', 'Apparently', 'something', 'do', 'affection', 'inflicting', 'pain', 'scholar', 'subject', 'up', 'being', 'tired', 'utterly', 'payoff', 'climax', 'Cross', 'Picasso', 'so', 'horribly', 'photographed', 'shaky-cam', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'headache', 'watch', 'too', 'closely.ALEX', 'CROSS', 'produced', 'QED', 'International', 'Block/Hanson', 'Emmett/Furla', 'Films', 'host', 'others', 'including', 'James', 'Patterson', 'Entertainment', 'DVD', 'distribution', 'being', 'handled', 'Summit', 'Entertainment', 'technical', 'specifications', 'looks', 'as', 'high', 'quality', 'can', 'get', 'are', 'handful', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Cohen', 'short', 'adapting', 'CROSS', 'screen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'MILDLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'Meh', 'Medea', 'Crime', 'really', 'sums', 'one', 'up', 'very', 'little', 'substance', 'film', 'based', 'popular', 'series', 'novels', 'James', 'Patterson', 'fault', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'inability', 'project', 'real', 'gravitas', 'seminal', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Cross', 'much', 'more', 'blame', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'feet', 'screenwriters', 'Marc', 'Moss', 'Kerry', 'Williamson', 'unfortunately', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'little', 'sense', 'given', 'circumstantial', 'history', 'not', 'enough', 'discerning', 'interests', 'fairness', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'disclose', 'fine', 'folks', 'Summit', 'Entertainment', 'provided', 'DVD', 'copy', 'ALEX', 'CROSS', 'expressed', 'purposes', 'completing', 'review']",N/A

1551529,A26SV90ILK5BNO,B008FCWZJO,Ethan,"[2, 2]","I've been a fan of James Patterson's Alex Cross series since I first read Mary, Mary. Quickly, I got my hands on a copy Along Came A Spider, and have read every Cross novel since. There have been adaptations of Along Came A Spider and Kiss the Girls, both staring Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross. With Hollywoods recent trend of sequels and remakes/reboots, it came as no surprise when I heard that a new incarnation of the Alex Cross series was beginning production.Based on the novel, Cross, a kind of new direction for the books as well, I was more surprised when I heard Tyler Perry had been cast as the famed detective. Known more for his comedies than his serious work, Perry was a bold choice that could have potentially changed the direction of his career. With the talented Matthew Fox (most famous perhaps for his role on the T.V. series LOST) playing the main villain in the film, it seemed viewers were in for a real treat.Unfortunately, the actors are never allowed to reach their full potential. While Fox really plays a deplorable villain and Perry shows surprising dramatic chops, they are both weighed down by a script that is simply not good enough. Patterson has never been one to worry about the plausibility of his stories, but the film mostly ignores Patterson's plot, taking the story into even more unbelievable directions. Both characters hint at deeper emotional backstories, but plot never allows them or the audience to delve past the surface. Rather, they are used more as pawns to lead us through a cat and mouse game that comes to an unsatisfying conclusion. For casual action fans, this film is a fine escape that doesn't require much thinking and has a few promising scenes. For fans of Patterson and his Alex Cross series, this movie uses the name Alex Cross for a character that only slightly resembles the one in Patterson's novels.

The only character in the film that has any substance is the one portrayed by Matthew Fox - and that isn't really a good thing.  There needed to be more balance.  The other characters aren't really developed very well at all and there's this sense of phoniness (preaching one thing and doing another) which I find a little unnerving -  I feel that Mr. Perry really tried to make this character work, but the script was such that he didn't have much to work with.  I don't know much about Dr. Cross other than what I'm told - it doesn't do much for me as far as getting me to like the hero and getting me to be sympathetic to him.  The film tells me that he is very experienced, but I get the impression from watching the film that he really is a novice, and doesn't know much about detective work, and then at the end I'm supposed to believe that he pulled it all together.  What a bunch of BS - it was just a bad film overall.  Like I said, the only character in the film that is sold out to making the film work is the one played by Matthew Fox - he does this role perfectly.  But one person doesn't make the whole film work, and I didn't think this was a good movie at all.  I think Tyler Perry did try to make the movie his own, but that's part of the problem too.  You are supposed to convince me why I'm supposed to care, and you didn't do that very well.  Maybe it's my attitude as a movie watcher - but it's your job to engage me. And not only did I not really believe the line of BS that I was watching that I really think this movie communicated this in a manner which wasn't exactly how Mr. Patterson intended and it communicated some messages which go against what you are telling me the character &#34;believed&#34; to begin with.

I'm a huge fan of James Patterson for years, I admire Tyler Perry for Superb Acting Performance, and thrillers are my all-time favorite genre. This exciting, action-packed thriller aims to please, and this is one of the Best gripping thrillers of 2012 that I certainly can watch again-and-again as I add it to my collection. Alex Cross follows the young, psychologist/detective Tyler Perry, adapted from James Patterson's Bestselling novels, which I am addicted to.  Cross meets his match in a serial killer, Matthew Fox, as the two face-off in a thrilling game of cat and mouse. Then, the mission becomes personal and Cross is pushed to the edge of his psychological limits. The action becomes explosive, the plot is filled with mystery and intense suspense, and the entire cast did an excellent job in Performance. Special Effects very good, and this exciting thriller has you biting your nails throughout. This crime mystery is as mesmerizing as KISS THE GIRLS, and as chilling as ALONG CAME A SPIDER. Tyler Perry is as brilliant and amazing as Morgan Freeman is, and I'm not surprised at all in his excellent Acting Performance.

1551540,A24PMZJF0LHGCW,B008FCWZJO,Gilby Mitnick III Jr.,"[6, 15]","Some people are wondering if this Tyler Perry individual can fill the shoes of the retiring Morgan Freeman, whose greatest role ever was Lucius Fox in Batman, and I do believe the answer is a resounding yes! Alex Cross is of course the third continuation of the Alex Cross franchise that started in the late 70s and early 80s, when Morgan Freeman could still act and didn't have so much white hair. I saw a special showing of this film that also stars Matthew Fox, whose best role was on Party of Five, and Edward Burns, whose best role was in the Brothers MacMilken.I have always thought that James Patterson was an amazing novelist, and the Alex Cross novels prove my point to a tee. I found this particular Alex Cross installment very thrilling, engaging and especially intelligent. It, of course, follows the titular Alex Cross, who is a cross-dressing detective (hence, his name!) who is fond of investigating cases while dressed up as an old, black woman with a massive anger management problem and obsessive overuse of ebonics. He...or she, as the case may be...is pushed to his...or her...limits by Matthew Fox, who is the serial killer in this highly intelligent piece of fiction. Fox is a serial killer who manages to do all of his serial killing while being stranded on a remote and deserted island in the Pacific! Surely, this challenge is one that the cross-dressing Cross has never encountered before, which is why he is pushed to the breaking point!I mean, think of this: If you were a detective and were facing a serial killer who did not even have to be present in your city to do all of his killing...you'd feel pretty well s/c/r/e/wed, wouldn't you? Exactly! How could you catch him or stop him? How?! It doesn't seem possible. You see, this is precisely what I mean when I say that Patterson writes some of the most highly intelligent and thought-provoking novels out there...much better than that Dr. Seuss fellow, for sure.This film also has one of the best taglines I have ever heard of! Are you friggin ready for it? Well, are ya? Here it is: Don't eva cross Alex Cross, sucka! Genius! The marketing boys for this movie need to be promoted for that awesome line, baby. Currently this movie supposedly s/u/c/ks a lot, based on its 13 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

1551550,A1UMHCRVZQWQER,B008FCWZJO,"HillBuzz dot ORG ""HillBuzz dot ORG""","[9, 13]","I have to say I enjoyed this movie when I thought I'd hate it...but the whole time I watched it I could not stop missing Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross.  If you are a big fan of the Alex Cross books or the two previous Alex Cross movies then you might never be able to enjoy anyone else in the role besides Morgan Freeman.  I personally think it was absolutely stupid to recast this part and ever make an Alex Cross movie without Freeman in the role.  To me, it's like making an Indiana Jones movie with someone other than Harrison Ford in the part.  I know that Alex Cross is not as big a pop culture figure as Indy, but I really love the character and to me Freeman just was perfect.That said, you also have to let go of the fact that Cross lives in DC in the books and previous movies but now he's randomly been moved to Detroit.  That was really jarring to me, especially since most of this movie was filmed in Cleveland so it wasn't even really Detroit.  That's the kind of thing that really bothers me about movies like this...when I know they have changed the character for no reason.Aside from the above, though, I thought this movie was interesting until the last 15 minutes or so.  I still gave it a 5-star rating because the movie was good enough to make me forget that Tyler Perry was starring in it.  I don't like Perry and in fact find him obnoxious most of the time...but I didn't even once think of Madea or those other Tyler Perry movies while watching Alex Cross.  So he did a good job as an actor in this.  I also like Ed Burns in his part...though I did miss Alex Cross's best friend ""John"" and their relationship from the books and earlier movies.I think the actress who played NanaMamma was great...and I liked her better than the actress who previously played this character. I wish there was more of her in the movie because she and the kids are big parts of the books.  What makes an Alex Cross book fun is his home life characters and NanaMamma telling him what's right.  The movies have never really done a good job at showcasing this, which is a shame.Whenever I watch a movie on Amazon Instant Video I try to remember back to the days when I used to rent movies from a corner video store.  Back then, it would be about $3.99 to rent a DVD but I'd always end up returning them late so for me it would be like $6 or $7 in the end to see a movie.  It would be very rare for me to watch a movie more than once when I rented it...and more often than not I'd feel like I wasted my money in renting the movie in the first place.  I'd feel that way especially if it was cold or raining and I had to walk the DVDs back to that store...all because I rented the stupid movies to begin with.I have to say that I would have been glad I rented Alex Cross even if it did cost me late fees back in the day.  I am glad I rented it on Amazon for the $3.99 I spent and I actually would watch this again in a few years when it's one of the $1.99 or $.99 rentals on here.I still miss Morgan Freeman, but I enjoyed Tyler Perry in this role more than I ever thought I could like him in anything.",5,You need to forget about Morgan Freeman and earlier Alex Cross movies/books to enjoy this,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,3099,"['have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'when', 'thought', ""'d"", 'hate', 'whole', 'time', 'watched', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'missing', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'books', 'two', 'previous', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'movies', 'then', 'might', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'anyone', 'else', 'role', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'personally', 'think', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stupid', 'recast', 'part', 'ever', 'make', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'movie', 'Freeman', 'role', 'making', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'movie', 'someone', 'other', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'part', 'know', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'not', 'as', 'big', 'pop', 'culture', 'figure', 'Indy', 'really', 'love', 'character', 'Freeman', 'just', 'was', 'perfect.That', 'said', 'also', 'have', 'let', 'go', 'fact', 'Cross', 'DC', 'books', 'previous', 'movies', 'now', 'randomly', 'been', 'moved', 'Detroit', 'was', 'really', 'jarring', 'especially', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Cleveland', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'Detroit', 'kind', 'thing', 'really', 'movies', 'when', 'know', 'have', 'changed', 'character', 'reason.Aside', 'above', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'still', 'gave', '5-star', 'rating', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'was', 'starring', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Perry', 'fact', 'find', 'obnoxious', 'most', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'once', 'think', 'Madea', 'other', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'movies', 'watching', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'actor', 'also', 'Ed', 'Burns', 'part', 'did', 'miss', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'best', 'friend', 'John', 'relationship', 'books', 'earlier', 'movies.I', 'think', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'NanaMamma', 'was', 'great', 'liked', 'better', 'actress', 'who', 'previously', 'played', 'character', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'movie', 'kids', 'are', 'big', 'parts', 'books', 'What', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'book', 'fun', 'home', 'life', 'characters', 'NanaMamma', 'telling', 'what', 'right', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'showcasing', 'shame.Whenever', 'watch', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'try', 'remember', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'used', 'rent', 'movies', 'corner', 'video', 'store', 'Back', 'then', 'would', 'be', '3.99', 'rent', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'always', 'end', 'up', 'returning', 'late', 'so', 'would', 'be', '6', '7', 'end', 'see', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'rare', 'watch', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'when', 'rented', 'more', 'often', 'not', ""'d"", 'feel', 'wasted', 'money', 'renting', 'movie', 'first', 'place', ""'d"", 'feel', 'way', 'especially', 'was', 'cold', 'raining', 'had', 'walk', 'DVDs', 'back', 'store', 'rented', 'stupid', 'movies', 'begin', 'with.I', 'have', 'say', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'glad', 'rented', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'even', 'did', 'cost', 'late', 'fees', 'back', 'day', 'am', 'glad', 'rented', 'Amazon', '3.99', 'spent', 'actually', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'few', 'years', 'when', 'one', '1.99', '.99', 'rentals', 'here.I', 'still', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'enjoyed', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'role', 'more', 'ever', 'thought', 'could', 'like', 'anything']",N/A

1551553,A25GMONBLGQE1U,B008FCWZJO,"H. Ross ""biblemonkey""","[1, 1]","Rob Cohen&#8217;s &#8220;Alex Cross,&#8221; based on a novel by James Patterson, had a lot of potential. It has some decent mystery built in, and at least one stellar performance. Sadly, it is bogged down with ratings restrictions, more mediocre performances, plot holes, and exceptionally bad dialogue. This is one of those movies that could have been great, but comes off rather forgettable.Detective Alex Cross (Tyler Perry attempting to break out of comedy) is a criminal profiler in Detroit. He and his team (forgettably portrayed by Edward Burns and Rachel Nichols) have made a name for themselves solving high profile cases with ingenuity and guts. When a horrific multiple murder in a ritzy neighborhood turns out to be the work of a sadistic assassin, the team follows hot on his trail trying to bring him down before he can claim another victim. When they foil his next assassination attempt, the killer takes it personally and seeks revenge against the investigators who dared to defy him.A lot happens in this movie, but there isn&#8217;t much to write about. Matthew Fox as the killer is the one truly bright spot in an otherwise blas&eacute; movie. His performance deserved so much more than the script had to offer him, but he steals the show. Judging by his performance and the basic premise of the film, the movie seemed like it was intended to be much more edgy and dark. Sadly, this movie suffers the curse of the dreaded PG-13 that Hollywood loves to impose on their more violent movies so as to get a few more bucks out of the coveted 13-18 year old demographic. In a movie where a man calmly cuts off a woman&#8217;s fingers one by one just for fun, there is little to no blood to be seen and I have heard more swearing from soccer moms. I am not saying movies need to be gory or foul to be good, but sometimes the subject matter needs to be treated a bit more realistically. When people get shot in the chest a small puff of dust is not usually the result.Tyler Perry makes a valiant attempt at dramatic acting with this role, but he seemed woefully out of his depth. Most of the time he was bland and forgettable and seemed to be struggling to find the right emotion with his face and voice. There were a few good moments, but it is not a good sign when you are getting out acted in a scene with a ten year old.The action-packed climax had its moments, but was fraught with plot holes and laughable inconsistencies. I found it more than a little unbelievable that Perry could go toe to toe with Fox, especially considering how the movie established Fox as such a brutal fighter earlier. Fox&#8217;s last line in the movie makes no sense and the convenient &#8220;the cops show up after everything is over&#8221; trope was so poorly executed that I wanted to call a foul on the play. The epilogue of the movie was contrived and felt tacked on as a cheap way of writing the movie out of a corner. The closing scene after the epilogue (yes, you read that right) felt like cheap sentimentality considering the seriousness of the subject matter and lacked any genuine emotion.&#8221;Alex Cross&#8221; may have started out as a good story with a real plot, but once the screenwriters, director, and producers got hold of it, it got jumbled and turned into boring, easily digestible mush. It is not a bad movie, per se, but it is far from being a good movie. The story never seems to know if it wants to be about Cross or the killer. There is so much speculation about the killer, but no closure is ever given and though that kind of open-ended narrative can work in the right movie, here it does not. Matthew Fox&#8217;s performance is the only thing that keeps the viewer&#8217;s attention, and I wish they had re-edited this movie as a solid R rating and given it a rewrite instead of cutting it off at the knees with a PG-13. It probably would have been a far superior film.",3,Got An Extra Star For Fox,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,3895,"['Rob', 'Cohen', '8217', '8220', 'Alex', 'Cross', '8221', 'based', 'novel', 'James', 'Patterson', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'decent', 'mystery', 'built', 'least', 'one', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Sadly', 'bogged', 'down', 'ratings', 'restrictions', 'more', 'mediocre', 'performances', 'plot', 'holes', 'exceptionally', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'one', 'movies', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'off', 'rather', 'forgettable.Detective', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'attempting', 'break', 'comedy', 'criminal', 'profiler', 'Detroit', 'team', 'forgettably', 'portrayed', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'have', 'made', 'name', 'solving', 'high', 'profile', 'cases', 'ingenuity', 'guts', 'When', 'horrific', 'multiple', 'murder', 'ritzy', 'neighborhood', 'out', 'be', 'work', 'sadistic', 'assassin', 'team', 'hot', 'trail', 'trying', 'bring', 'down', 'can', 'claim', 'victim', 'When', 'foil', 'next', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'killer', 'personally', 'revenge', 'investigators', 'who', 'dared', 'defy', 'him.A', 'lot', 'movie', 'there', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'much', 'write', 'about', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'killer', 'one', 'truly', 'bright', 'spot', 'otherwise', 'blas', 'eacute', 'movie', 'performance', 'deserved', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'script', 'had', 'offer', 'show', 'Judging', 'performance', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'movie', 'seemed', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'edgy', 'dark', 'Sadly', 'movie', 'curse', 'dreaded', 'PG-13', 'Hollywood', 'impose', 'more', 'violent', 'movies', 'so', 'get', 'few', 'more', 'bucks', 'coveted', '13-18', 'year', 'old', 'demographic', 'movie', 'where', 'man', 'calmly', 'woman', '8217', 'fingers', 'one', 'one', 'just', 'fun', 'little', 'blood', 'be', 'seen', 'have', 'heard', 'more', 'swearing', 'soccer', 'moms', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'movies', 'need', 'be', 'gory', 'foul', 'be', 'good', 'sometimes', 'subject', 'matter', 'needs', 'be', 'treated', 'bit', 'more', 'realistically', 'When', 'people', 'get', 'shot', 'chest', 'small', 'puff', 'dust', 'not', 'usually', 'result.Tyler', 'Perry', 'valiant', 'attempt', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'role', 'seemed', 'woefully', 'depth', 'Most', 'time', 'was', 'bland', 'forgettable', 'seemed', 'be', 'struggling', 'find', 'right', 'emotion', 'face', 'voice', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'when', 'are', 'getting', 'out', 'acted', 'scene', 'ten', 'year', 'old.The', 'action-packed', 'climax', 'had', 'moments', 'was', 'fraught', 'plot', 'holes', 'laughable', 'inconsistencies', 'found', 'more', 'little', 'unbelievable', 'Perry', 'could', 'go', 'toe', 'toe', 'Fox', 'especially', 'considering', 'how', 'movie', 'established', 'Fox', 'such', 'brutal', 'fighter', 'earlier', 'Fox', '8217', 's', 'last', 'line', 'movie', 'sense', 'convenient', '8220', 'cops', 'show', 'up', 'everything', '8221', 'trope', 'was', 'so', 'poorly', 'executed', 'wanted', 'call', 'foul', 'play', 'epilogue', 'movie', 'was', 'contrived', 'felt', 'tacked', 'cheap', 'way', 'writing', 'movie', 'corner', 'closing', 'scene', 'epilogue', 'yes', 'read', 'right', 'felt', 'cheap', 'sentimentality', 'considering', 'seriousness', 'subject', 'matter', 'lacked', 'genuine', 'emotion.', '8221', 'Alex', 'Cross', '8221', 'may', 'have', 'started', 'out', 'good', 'story', 'real', 'plot', 'once', 'screenwriters', 'director', 'producers', 'got', 'hold', 'got', 'jumbled', 'turned', 'boring', 'easily', 'digestible', 'mush', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'se', 'far', 'being', 'good', 'movie', 'story', 'never', 'know', 'be', 'Cross', 'killer', 'so', 'much', 'speculation', 'killer', 'closure', 'ever', 'given', 'kind', 'open-ended', 'narrative', 'can', 'work', 'right', 'movie', 'here', 'not', 'Matthew', 'Fox', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'only', 'thing', 'viewer', '8217', 'attention', 'wish', 'had', 're-edited', 'movie', 'solid', 'R', 'rating', 'given', 'rewrite', 'instead', 'cutting', 'off', 'knees', 'PG-13', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'superior', 'film']",N/A

1551630,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B008FCWZJO,MadMacs,"[35, 45]","Straight up: Didn't think Tyler Perry could do drama. But then I thought about the old saying that the best comedians typically grow up enduring the worst kind of abuses, their humor an outgrowth reflection of pain. So I have respect for Perry crossing over to challenge a new stage, likely using that pain to help him become a more complex, non-comedic, character.This prequel version of a younger Alex Cross gives us his story before joining the FBI. Already a brilliant investigator, he and his team of cops are suddenly thrust into a strange series of murders. Bad enough the bodies are piling up, but these are not your typical victims. Detroit's elite one-percenters are suddenly being hunted by an insidious killer; one who doesn't appreciate being interrupted or distracted from his mission.Perry was not bad. Nothing quite like the original, but then who could be? Morgan Freeman is, cinematically speaking, a cultural icon exponentially cubed. Still, all things taken into consideration, his rebooted replacement was very decent. Thankfully, the producers didn't go for an MTV type of recast, hiring some slick songster wanting to break into films. For that alone I'm very grateful.The choice of Matthew Fox was interesting. He's one of those performers thatseemingly found his one role. Of course, actors who find that role often learn to detest it, treating it like an albatross hanging from the neck of one's career. Most end up forever boxed. But in this film I found his execution not shabby at all and better than expected; hinting that he has more to offer as a performer. One weakness: I realize that the character's speech impediment was foundational, but thought it limited the performance; if he was going for theFrancis Dolarhyde model, then it should've been more pronounced.Additionally, Picasso isn't a fully constructed character. We don't get to know the person other than the flimsy details as sketched out in the screenplay, making it that much more difficult to engage. Unfortunate. Felt the role was unfinished and could've easily taken on more weight. And speaking of which...Absolutely loved that Matt bulked up for the film - he looked fantastic!The direction was adequate for the subject matter, but lacked creativity. Example: When Alex deciphers the hidden clue to the assassin's next target, we don't get to share that ""Ah ha!"" moment because Director Rob Cohen failed to appreciate the scene as one of us, the audience. We didn't read the script, post storyboards, go thru rehearsal, film, then sit down at the post production edits - for us in the audience it was a new and fresh revelation - and he blew it. A missed opportunity.Also, I don't appreciate shaky-cam slo-mo with high pass contrast in place of solid fight choreography. If Cohen wanted to showcase CQB skill - showcase the skill. Extraordinarily difficult to screen a battle if it's filmed like the cinematographer dropped acid before the scene commenced; thought we left this kind of cheesy effect back in the 80s.Again, adequate direction with decent rhythm and solid pacing. And considering this was a Rob Cohen piece, I'm pleased it was adequate. The man is not known for quality.Overall, decently entertaining with moments of interest and depth. Just wished it had not followed a pre-approved studio template.Torn between grades. A strong three or a very low four.Call it a three with hints of a four.All things considered, and given the end of the film, I'm actually looking forward to another in the series - as long as the producers hire a more skilled director.

1551635,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B008FCWZJO,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","As a fan of James Patterson's novels involving Alex Cross I was anxious to see how the new version held up. Both pervious films starring Morgan Freeman were good but his depiction of Cross was far from what the books involved, most noticeably his age. When I heard Tyler Perry was chosen for the role my only hope was that he wouldn't do it in drag. So does the new version hold up? Quite well actually.The film opens with Cross and his partners chasing a criminal through the decaying area of Detroit. He is caught and another criminal is off the streets. Cross goes home to his family, a reprieve from the mean streets he patrols so well. There he learns that in addition to his two children and mother that live with him, his wife is expecting another child but insist he tell no one. Like that's gonna happen.Cut to a paid assassin named Picasso (Matthew Fox) who is stalking his next target, a wealthy woman he seduces by fighting mercilessly in an illegal mixed martial arts ring. Going home with her, she takes him to her bed only to have him inject her with a paralyzing drug and then torturing her for information.Cross is awakened in the early hours of the day and calls in his partner Thomas (Edward Burns). Since Thomas was with Monica, another officer, he lets him know getting involved with another police person will just result in one of them having to leave. The question is left in the air and they head towards the crime scene. Cross checks out the scene and deduces that the killer paralyzed the victim and then took out all three of her hired guards. Looking through the house, they discover a missing laptop but then find a back up hard drive the victim kept hidden.Through various clues Cross puts together the identity of the next victim and he and his team head out to keep him from being murdered. While at this location they run into Picasso and prevent him from fulfilling his mission. The only problem is that in getting in his way he sets out to make sure it doesn't happen again first by torturing and killing Monica and then by killing Cross' wife.More determined than ever to make sure his family is safe, Cross doubles his efforts to find this psycho who not only kills for a living but enjoys inflicting pain in others. As the clues and body counts begin to add up, Cross and his partner keep moving closer to that final confrontation with Picasso.The suspense in this film is one that builds slowly like the best of criminal procedural films but a little bit disjointed at times. This doesn't distract from the story though and its one that not only develops the characters in the film but holds your interest from start to finish as the reason for catching the killer moves from professional to personal.There isn't a bad performance in this film. Standing out is Perry as Cross. Having seen Perry in constant drag as Medea in his series of films it was interesting to discover that he's actually a good actor without hiding behind the petticoat. The slow burn he displays as his motives alter is well developed and by the end of the film you find yourself anxiously anticipating the next chapter in the stories of Alex Cross. Fox turns in a hair raising performance as the psycho killer Picasso making him not only a worthy adversary but a terrifying one as well.Though no word is out yet if another film is in the works, fans can hope that this becomes a series of films rather than a stand alone production. Perry does indeed get the character right and would be able to carry the series into long term standing. Let's just hope that this film does well enough on DVD to insure that it happens. Should it do so fans of Patterson's Alex Cross will find something to look forward to other than the latest installment at the book store.",4,CORRECT CROSS,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,3773,"['fan', 'James', 'Patterson', 'novels', 'involving', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'how', 'new', 'version', 'held', 'up', 'pervious', 'films', 'starring', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'were', 'good', 'depiction', 'Cross', 'was', 'far', 'what', 'books', 'involved', 'most', 'noticeably', 'age', 'When', 'heard', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'was', 'chosen', 'role', 'only', 'hope', 'was', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'drag', 'So', 'new', 'version', 'hold', 'up', 'Quite', 'well', 'actually.The', 'film', 'Cross', 'partners', 'chasing', 'criminal', 'decaying', 'area', 'Detroit', 'caught', 'criminal', 'streets', 'Cross', 'home', 'family', 'reprieve', 'mean', 'streets', 'so', 'well', 'addition', 'two', 'children', 'mother', 'live', 'wife', 'expecting', 'child', 'insist', 'one', 'gon', 'happen.Cut', 'paid', 'assassin', 'named', 'Picasso', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'who', 'stalking', 'next', 'target', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'fighting', 'mercilessly', 'illegal', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'ring', 'Going', 'home', 'bed', 'only', 'have', 'inject', 'paralyzing', 'drug', 'then', 'torturing', 'information.Cross', 'awakened', 'early', 'hours', 'day', 'partner', 'Thomas', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'Thomas', 'was', 'Monica', 'officer', 'know', 'getting', 'involved', 'police', 'person', 'will', 'just', 'result', 'one', 'having', 'leave', 'question', 'left', 'air', 'head', 'crime', 'scene', 'Cross', 'out', 'scene', 'killer', 'paralyzed', 'victim', 'then', 'took', 'out', 'three', 'hired', 'guards', 'Looking', 'house', 'discover', 'missing', 'laptop', 'then', 'find', 'back', 'up', 'hard', 'drive', 'victim', 'kept', 'hidden.Through', 'various', 'clues', 'Cross', 'together', 'identity', 'next', 'victim', 'team', 'head', 'keep', 'being', 'murdered', 'location', 'run', 'Picasso', 'prevent', 'fulfilling', 'mission', 'only', 'problem', 'getting', 'way', 'out', 'make', 'sure', ""n't"", 'happen', 'again', 'first', 'torturing', 'killing', 'Monica', 'then', 'killing', 'Cross', 'wife.More', 'determined', 'ever', 'make', 'sure', 'family', 'safe', 'Cross', 'efforts', 'find', 'psycho', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'living', 'inflicting', 'pain', 'others', 'clues', 'body', 'counts', 'begin', 'add', 'up', 'Cross', 'partner', 'keep', 'moving', 'closer', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Picasso.The', 'suspense', 'film', 'one', 'slowly', 'best', 'criminal', 'procedural', 'films', 'little', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'times', ""n't"", 'distract', 'story', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'characters', 'film', 'interest', 'start', 'finish', 'reason', 'catching', 'killer', 'moves', 'professional', 'personal.There', ""n't"", 'bad', 'performance', 'film', 'Standing', 'out', 'Perry', 'Cross', 'Having', 'seen', 'Perry', 'constant', 'drag', 'Medea', 'series', 'films', 'was', 'interesting', 'discover', 'actually', 'good', 'actor', 'hiding', 'petticoat', 'slow', 'burn', 'motives', 'alter', 'well', 'developed', 'end', 'film', 'find', 'anxiously', 'anticipating', 'next', 'chapter', 'stories', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'Fox', 'hair', 'raising', 'performance', 'psycho', 'killer', 'Picasso', 'making', 'not', 'only', 'worthy', 'adversary', 'terrifying', 'one', 'well.Though', 'word', 'out', 'yet', 'film', 'works', 'fans', 'can', 'hope', 'series', 'films', 'rather', 'stand', 'alone', 'production', 'Perry', 'indeed', 'get', 'character', 'right', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'carry', 'series', 'long', 'term', 'standing', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', 'film', 'well', 'enough', 'DVD', 'insure', 'Should', 'do', 'so', 'fans', 'Patterson', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'look', 'forward', 'other', 'latest', 'installment', 'book', 'store']",N/A

Even though the main villain in the story was properly picked with exceptional athletic abilities and military training, the entire plot was fragmented between emphasis of the wrestling ability of the villain, his spying skills in penetrating highly secured crime rings, and the winded dialogues intended to kill time and fill space.Long minutes were spent on talks on joining the FBI between three players on three occasions for no clear purpose other than the unfocused plot of the moviemaker.Somehow, a highly skilled technical guy who could tamper with circuitry of the train in such manner as to time the shooting of a court house entrance with the speeding train, yet failed to evade GPS and VIN tracking his car while committing a crime.

The movie was very watchable and we recommend it.However, having read most of Patterson's Alex Cross series books I agree with other reviewers that this movie feels like a patch-work of bits and pieces of his books put into a salad bowl and the pieces kinda ended wherever they were tossed. Much of the acting was believable and it was easy to get to feel like you knew the characters... but then the more likeable ones were taken from us.  The loss of two happened in such quick succession that it seemed to happen without real emotional effect or lingering passion... actually, once Picasso dispatched with one (named withheld to avoid spoiler...) there was no real mention of that character thereafter (no funeral, brotherhood celebration of his/her life, wake, etc...). Odd.Matthew Fox played an insanely terrific bad guy -- he was ripped for the part and came across as 100% certifiable, scary and creepy. Serious transformation from other parts I have seen him play, and man did he pull it of with gusto. Wow.Tyler Perry's dramatic acting was OK, though he kinda looked lost (as in lost in the script, not just lost due to the character losing his wife and colleague) from time-to-time and the makeup made his face look very odd on some camera angles... somewhat lurch-like.Cicely Tyson, bless her past exceptional acting, just didn't do anything for me with Nana Mama other than come across as a stern bee-atch waiting to spit a little more venom in anyone's direction.Don't know what the heck John McGinley was doing as the Chief; it was like he was stuck in his Scrubs character and was just doing a series of ""Here I Am"" cameos... like another reviewer noted, I just kept wishing that Fox (Picasso) would toast the Chief early on so we would not have to see him on screen again.One thing that really bugged us all was the super crazy camera shaking during the climactic fight scene between Picasso and Cross... it gave half of us headaches, and the others all decided to take a bathroom break or grab another brew halfway through it. What was up with that technique??? It almost seemed like maybe Perry and Fox sucked at fighting and the director was trying to figure out a way to cover it up. Really bad technique.Our bottom line: Tyler Perry has potential so do not give up on him in this role.  He (and his character) should move on to the FBI and gain some more experience, then try this again. This production was watchable and even enjoyable despite the challenges of trying too hard by using highly recognizable supporting cast who were just wrong for their parts.Bring on the next one and consider different directing, and I'll bet that the next installment matures into a good production.",4,Alex Cross DVD - As a fan of Patterson and Perry this is a tough movie to review.

Mercier,Cicely Tyson as Nana Mama,Giancarlo Esposito as Daramus Holiday and many others.The protagonist here is played by Tyler Perry,whose character,the self titled Alex Cross,we last saw played previously by Morgan Freeman in two earlier movies.As the film opens we are introduced to Cross who is a Detroit psychologist/policeman/and astounding profiler,all in one.He can look at just about anyone or thing and almost instantly assess what they have done,what caused an object to be where it is,etc.,and in great detail.His partner is Kane and they have a very tight working and personal relationship.Simultaneously we are intro'd to one Picasso,who pays to fight an extreme fighter.He thoroughly trounces the man and a wealthy lady in the front row ends up taking him home and seducing him.However when he ties her up with her own stockings,he also injects a drug which paralyzes her;she can only see what he does to her but cannot react or verbalize.Cross and Kane investigate the grisly scene and determine that they definitely have a professionally sick man running loose.A sketch left behind by Picasso reveals initials which leads them to a German industrialist.Picasso's attempt at another murder is foiled by Kane and Cross.Picasso is now on the revenge path.In retaliation he beats up Kane's girlfriend then during dining at a restaurant he wastes Cross' pregnant wife.Kane and Cross meet up with the owner of the German business,Mercier.He is a multi million dollar businessman and it quickly becomes apparent HE is the actual target of Picasso's desires and implores Cross to help him.Meanwhile Cross and Kane track down a local criminal called Holiday.They stole a gun out of the evidence room and present it to him,one to be used against him in am upcoming trial.Holiday will get the gun in exchange for him telling them where exactly the paralyzing drug comes from that Picasso uses to render his victims helpless.With that info they head off to see the drug dealer and they find video with a license plate number that belongs to Picasso.When Cross and Kane learn that Mercier is about to attend a conference they speed over but it is all in vain as a bazooka blast from a nearby rail train Picasso commandeered,takes care of Mercier and his men.Cross and Kane track Picasso down and smash their vehicle into his as he leaves a nearby parking lot to escape.The fight returns back inside the parking lot as Cross faces Picasso alone.The fight ends when Picasso falls to his death.Picasso is dead but Cross claims it's not over.Cross has put two and two together and realized it was Mercier who set Picasso loose to begin with to fake his death,by killing his underlings and a look a like during the conference.Cross has pre sent bags of cocaine to his private villa in Cambodia.Cross tips the local police who arrive and arrest Mercier.The film ends as Kane drops off Cross at his house,who is moving to a job in Washington,to which Kane will follow.The action here is swift(at times) but predictable throughout.The whole premise of a sick serial killer on the loose goes way back in movies and this one just doesn't stand out over and above the more mundane of that lot.The film is stoically directed by Rob Cohen and I thought it had the look and feel of a made for television movie.It is a been there done that movie.It was nice though to see black veterans Tyson(Cross's mom)and Esposito(Holiday)back in the spotlight again.I haven't seen either for some time.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette and deleted scenes.All in all a tepidly directed and executed piece of film.It is not a bad or poor film ,it's just not great or even above average.All the acting

1551741,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B008FCWZJO,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[1, 1]","Liked:(1) Tyler Perry and Ed Burns are good; Cicely Tyson is good except in one scene, which I'll mention in the Disliked section; Mathew Fox was good, and the actress who played Tyler Perry's wife gave one of the best death scene performances I've seen, she was very believable; the lady who played Tyler and Ed's partner was good; the leads were mostly fine.(2) Strong scene when Cicely Tyson's character tried to convince Tyler Perry's character not to seek revenge - best scene in the script.  Both characters told the truth, which I liked.Disliked:(1) Script - poorly executed story.  This story was the first time I'd seen or heard of the character so I knew nothing about him, and the opening sequences of him chasing down a criminal, chastising his co-workers (""you're like 6th graders""), going to visit a prisoner, then home, seeing him with his child and his mom - it was all too little information and poorly told, too choppy and abrupt for me to get a sense of him.  First, criticizing his co-workers, the writer should have shown me how they failed.  All I saw was 3 officers chasing a male, who they told numerous times to halt, and the suspect failed to do so.  In real life, if 3 police officers are chasing you and tell you numerous times to halt, and you do not, you most likely will be shot, multiple times, and probably will die.  Most American citizens know this, even many children know, so adults do certainly.  When one officer character shot the suspect in the leg, and the Tyler Perry and Ed Burns characters didn't, I found it unbelievable.  The writer should have shown me on what grounds Tyler Perry's character had to criticize the other two; at least the female officer slowed the suspect down.Why did Alex Cross go visit the convict - in his discussion with her he said he believed she was innocent and was taking the rap for a family member - if he believed it was so, and he wanted her released, why didn't the writer show him working toward that goal.  Why would a prisoner trust a police officer she never met before she got into trouble?  Why did Alex Cross care about her particularly?  The writer needed to show the connection between him and the prisoner.  Alex Cross is a police officer, it makes sense a convict would be suspicious of him, and the audience is given no information about his motives.  This is the beginning of the story and this lack of information is not good.  The writer is supposed to be helping the audience enter the story, helping us to understand, attach to (care about) Alex Cross; we need to know what makes him tick - and the writer needs to show us, not tell us.  If Alex is trying to free an innocent person we need to see him working towards that with other officials either before he met with the prisoner or after, and we need to be told why he believes she's innocent, and, why he cares.  He says she has no priors, and that it doesn't make sense for her to suddenly kill these people, whereas her uncle has a long rap sheet and would go to prison basically for the rest of his life.  Okay, but why does he think this about a person he doesn't know?  The audience needs to see something (witness some information) regarding how he reached this conclusion.  After all, killers kill for the first time every day.  What was unusual about this person, as a first time killer, that made her stand out?  People with no previous criminal record perform heinous acts everyday.  It is not unusual to read in the paper that a psychopath had no previous criminal record, so what about this particular character made Alex Cross suspect she was taking the fall.The interaction between Alex Cross and his daughter is awkward, and should have been better written.Cicely Tyson's character came on too strong in ordering her granddaughter upstairs to do her homework.  It would have been okay if the writer had shown the audience her previously ordering the child, and the kid disobeying, to perhaps impishly get out of doing her homework by playing piano for her father, who hadn't known about the previous order.  Something along those lines; anything that made sense.  All grandparents are not soft and cuddly, but when they are coming down on their grandchild even harsher than the parent, the writer needs to show why.  Tyler Perry's character didn't say ""but mom, she was just showing me blah, blah, blah,"" which would have made sense, given his mom's harsh tone.  Poor writing; this is our lead, this is his family, this is our family, our attaching characters in the story, and we need to recognize their behavior, at the very least.(2) Editing - poor, no good transitions, perhaps they were not shot.(3) Music - didn't care for it.(4) Villain - weakest link.  Mathew Fox was fine, this is criticism of the character, how he was written.(a) An insane villain is not a good film villain, because a good film villain needs to scare the audience, and the audience knows that a mentally ill villain is seriously disadvantaged.  The audience needs a film villain who is competent, intelligent, capable, and at the top of his/her game.  A mentally ill villain simply is not at the top of their game, no matter how brilliant they are, and an audience knows it.  Mental illness is a handicap; a film villain needs to be viewed by the audience as a predator, a successful predator; she/he can be human, they need not be superman/woman, but they need a high skill set, and they need to impress the audience.  Mental illness, no matter how scary in a film, also generates pity.  You want your audience to fear the film villain, not pity him/her.  A mentally ill villain is at some level, not in control of their actions - when a writer writes their villain as mentally ill, presenting him that way to the audience, the audience knows that person is not in total control of their behaviors, they are sick, and their illness is not their fault. The villain needs to be totally in control of themselves, totally responsible for their behavior - they do what they want to do and don't care about the cost to anyone else.  A sick film villain is not competent to assess the cost.(b) High end mercenary - it's totally unbelievable that a high end mercenary would get so upset that Alex Cross could begin to anticipate his behavior, and almost catch him (at the building where his German target worked), that he would seek to avenge himself on Alex Cross, his team and their families.  I know no high end mercenaries, but think, you are a gun for hire, one of the best in the world, how do you get that way.  How is it you can charge what you want, and rich people can find you, though you're not listed in the phone book.  You must be intelligent, highly skilled at killing people, including knowing all kinds of machines to help you do that job (guns, just to name the obvious), and have lots of other technical knowledge about a wide range of subjects.  If you are a high end mercenary, it's doubtful that you are spiteful and stupid when it comes to your work.  You would probably be highly focused, and may not even enjoy killing, but simply be good at it and have no moral aversion to it.  You would not be a successful high end merc by going after police officers and their families.  Anyone physically attacking police officers and their families in retaliation against officers performing their jobs, are in effect, attacking the state, and attacking the state means you have declared war on the state - you have become a terrorist and the full force of national and international policing officials would be brought to bear against you.  So, it is obvious, that no high end merc would do this, certainly not in the context this film sets up.  If the Mathew Fox character as a high end merc found that his moves were being anticipated by the local law, what he would have done is completed his mission as soon as he possibly could, and then left.  He certainly would not have targeted the officers or their families, what professional needs that heat.  If, by some stretch, the merc became fascinated with the Alex Cross character, he might have followed Alex's future cases from afar.  At the most, he/she would have used the close call with Alex as a learning tool, as a professional is always striving to get better.  In the real world there are high end mercs, yet you never hear about them taking out police officers and their families.  High end mercs, high end assassins, wouldn't do this type of work (attack local police), they're on a whole other level; this movie merc is just poor storytelling.  If the writer needed the merc to fixate on Alex Cross, the merc could have had a loved one that got in the way and who Alex and his team took out.  That would have better explained the merc's interest in Alex, but no merc would believably take a loved one on a job, so the writer would have to show how Alex and his team's investigation lead them to someone the merc cared about, that may have worked.  But a professional assassin at the top of her/his game, and on a paying job, would not attack the investigating officers and their families, story just not believable as presented.(5) Police officers as law breakers - the writer spent more time showing how Alex Cross became a criminal (breaking into the evidence room and assaulting the officer on duty, conspiring with the criminal who allowed his niece to take the fall for him, to break the law by giving him the weapons used in the criminal's murder of others, framing the villain who hired the merc in the first place, who Alex Cross blamed for ultimately killing his wife, assaulting the chemist who created the date rape drugs), than he did showing why Alex Cross was superb at his job; the writer told the audience Alex Cross was good, but he didn't show us Alex's process, how he reached his conclusions.  We were told Alex Cross is clever (Ed Burns character told his girlfriend that Alex could tell you what you ate for breakfast), but the audience didn't get to experience it for ourselves; we were told it, we weren't shown it.I think writers should be careful about having heros in a story breaking the law with no negative repercussions for them, especially characters charged with upholding the law.  Unfortunately we know that our legal institutions are, like us, not perfect, and again unfortunately, our institutions reflect the racism and sexism of our society in many ways.  Also unfortunately times are about to get tougher for many Americans, especially the poorer of us, as petroleum prices are expected to begin rising significantly in the next 5, 10 years (see post carbon institute.com), and petroleum is used in the manufacture of nearly everything we eat and the items we use.  Prices will rise and the poor will become even more stressed, and some with undiagnosed mental illnesses, trapped by increasing prices, and unable to leave emotionally untenable, but paying jobs, may snap - we may see more people snap - and we don't need to see film stories with law officers matter of factly breaking the law, because they want to, and getting what they want with no repercussions; it may help a sick audience member, already angry and frustrated with their life, make an officer a target.  I am not saying don't show police corruption in film, I am saying writers should consider the world in which they are writing - if they want to show officers breaking the law, show that, but show them paying for the error of their ways, like an ordinary citizen would.  Don't let them be the hero, which in our culture has usually been the morally correct character, and the criminal getting away with crime too; if they are the hero, and they successfully break the law in your film, consider what you are suggesting to the audience.  Stories are not just stories; they help the culture know who we are; what laws and rules we share.  Over the next 10 or 20 years, this country, and the world, will be moving into a very different future than the one experienced in the recent past, because oil in the ground, but harder to access, will cost more.  Short term the world and the majority of us will have our income contract, and it will be painful.  I believe governments already know this.  Police officers, not perfect, but necessary enforcers of the law.  It is helpful to have at least the illusion of law for us ordinary folk.  I think writers should know and understand that even more challenging times are coming; be careful who you criminalize, and think very carefully about who they are in the story and in the real world, and how their behavior may be perceived by the audience.  In this story, Alex Cross began the film as a police officer who would not even shoot a fleeing suspect, and who visited a convicted felon in prison; he ended the story as a criminal himself, unconvicted and unpunished by the story's authorities, but clearly shown to be a criminal to the audience.  Is the writer saying that Alex Cross' behavior is okay because he is a police officer, and that police officers are above the law?  Alex Cross is the story hero, there is no other hero, so it makes sense for the audience to conclude that is what the writer is saying.  In an increasingly difficult world more people will be stressed, and I don't think it wise to show police officers as heros above the law; they can be heros, but within the law.  Telling a story this way may protect an officer from a person who has gone off the rails, and with increased stress on the world, more people may become ill who might have otherwise been able to cope in better times.  I am not the story police, just my opinion.Rate story - one star for acting, one star for filmmaking team's effort.",2,didn't care for it ...(spoilers),1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,13707,"['Liked',

1551751,A2PI38SNDNI13F,B008FCWZJO,Taylor J. Huston,"[0, 1]","I have been an ""Alex Cross"" fan for a while now and I just love the novel series!  I saw the other two adaptions with Morgan Freeman (a living legend) as our favorite detective, Det. Alex Cross.  ""Kiss the Girls"" was an amazing adaption that captured the world of the novel it was based off of so beautifully and awesome.  As for ""Along Came A Spider""..... no so much.  But I did enjoy Morgan Freeman.Now comes the next step into the world of Alex Cross and we are getting a ""reboot"" this time.  In this third adaption, we see none other than Tyler Perry take the role as Det. Alex Cross and just unleash his acting skills into making the character come to life.  Thank goodness that his time as ""Medea"" paid off.  And we also get to see new blood into the world as well.  Sure, the movie doesn't exactly remain completely true to the novels, but it does a great job at capturing the dark theme of the novels like ""Kiss the Girls"" did.Okay, I can understand why people don't like Rob Cohen as a director.  The only movie I ever liked that he made was ""Triple X"".  The guy isn't really that good at making a movie.  No offense to him, it's just the truth.  But despite that the director doesn't really have my attention, the storyline wasn't really that bad.  Sure, it needs some work, but it actually has a great emotional presence that just does a great job at bringing the dark and light themes from the novels and into the movies.The movie is an adaption of the twelfth novel in series, ""Cross"".  The movie doesn't exactly follow the novel like ""Kiss the Girls"" or ""Along Came A Spider"" did.  In fact, the movie actually borrows from the other novels and also just goes its own way for once.  The only thing that it actually remains loyal to, is the fact that Alex Cross is a honest detective and will do anything to protect his family from danger, while going after a killer at the same time.  Even though the movie doesn't follow the novel very well, it does bring the atmosphere of the novel and the dark presence to life.The characters are freaking amazing as well!  As usual, we have Mr. Tyler Perry, who not only brings Alex Cross to life with his acting and personality skills, but with his physically presence too.  We even see him as a loving husband and loving father to his kids, which we never saw in the other two movies.  We even get to see him in action as a detective and as a psychiatrist, which we are familiar to, but on a whole new level when Mr. Perry goes to work.  We also have Alex's partner and new character, Det. Tom Kane, who replaces John Sampson from the novel series, but keeps a great relation to John's character.  While Tom isn't really that interesting, he is fun to see around Alex, as they make jokes and talk about their fun times as kids.  We also have the sycho villain, Michael ""The Butcher"" Sullivan!  While he is called the Butcher, his real name is never fully given, except for in the novel.  Michael Fox is at his best as the evil assassin and proves to be one amazing adversary to Alex himself.  Michael makes this character so scary, that you will be praying for Alex's safety against him.  And finally, we have Alex's family.  In the movie, we get to finally meet Alex's kids, grandma, and wife for the first time.  While we do get a glimpse of Janelle and Nana Mama from ""Kiss the Girls"", we finally get to see them having big roles in this movie.  Both Damon and Janelle show us what life is like for Alex as he comes home from work and spends his time with them and also what it is like when they lose someone they love.  Nana Mama is.... well... Nana Mama.  Still Mrs. Grumpy and Bossy lady who is almost just like her ordinary self from the novels, except for the moments when she comforts Alex in hard times, which we don't see in the movie.  Maria Cross, the wife of Alex, is indeed beautiful as they say in the twelve book, with the exception of her personality.  In the past movies, there is no mention of Maria, except for a brief hint in ""Kiss the Girls"", when we see Alex touching his wedding on his finger, referencing to his marriage with Maria.  Her character is do very well in the movie, providing a very emotional moment when a unexpected situation happens.  Trust me, all of these characters are done beautifully!  While some characters have been replaced or personalities changed around, you love every minute of them.I know that some of you didn't like the storyline or didn't like the directing of the movie, but come on!  The acting and the theme of the movie wasn't all that bad.  There are worse movies out there.  The graphics were okay and the fast-pace was almost like from the novel.  You got to love Tyler Perry and Michael Fox as they bring their characters to life and make the world of Alex Cross real as possible.  I hear that a sequel is going to be made, which will be the thirteen novel, ""Double Cross"".  Please try to help get another movie going, because I can promise you this, if a new director and new scriptwriter help out with this new adaption, the sequel will be way better.  Trust me on that!So, if you happen to be a fan of the novels, you will love this movie!  Trust me!  Just buy it!",5,"A great film!

Alex Cross panicked, he played by the books etc. (spoilers) and basically just barely got the bad guy by accident and with help.

1551757,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B008FCWZJO,Tim Janson,"[0, 1]","Alex Cross is the third film to feature the title character and star of the best-selling mystery and thriller series of novels written by James Patterson.  In the first two films the character was portrayed by Morgan Freeman and this time around he is played by Tyler Perry in a reboot/prequel.  Cross is a forensic psychologist with the FBI although in this film he has not joined the FBI yet and is still a lieutenant with the Detroit Police Department.  Cross is offered a job with the FBI but his pregnant wife is reluctant to move to Washington D.C.Fox and his team of Tommy (Burns) and Monica (Rachel Nichols) are investigating a murderer who is targeting several extremely wealthy targets.  They are able to thwart the attempt on the life of a German businessman and in retaliation the killer, who calls himself Picasso (Fox) turns his attention to Cross and his team.  The sadistic Picasso first murders Cross's wife and then tortures and kills Monica who was Tommy's lover.Cross and Tommy now risk their careers, breaking into the Detroit Police evidence lockup in order to get the information they need to hunt down Picasso before he can take out his last wealthy victim, a billionaire named Giles Mercier (Jean Reno), and disappear.Cross is one of those Sherlock Holmes type minds who can make deductions from the most scant pieces of evidence.  The problem is that Rob Cohen almost gives Cross a superhuman level of intuition.  With a fluffball script, Cross just seems to figure everything out without any effort to rationalize how he did so.  So you end up with a guy who is the smartest guy in the room going up against a sadistic nutcase in a bizarre series of silly cat and mouse contests.  Picasso is one jump ahead of Cross but drives around in a car equipped with Onstar that allows him to be tracked.It's this sort of wild inconsistency that causes Alex Cross to shoot itself in the foot and it's stopped off with an utterly stupid twist ending.  I would hazard to guess that Picasso would not have a long career as a hitman being so easily upset that he loses sight of his main target to begin a vendetta with local law enforcement.  Perry is a talented writer and producer but less so of an actor, particularly for a dramatic thriller such as this.  He's far too wooden and his range of emotions is almost nonexistent.Matthew Fox is little better as the psychotic hitman.  Fox's attempt to come off as a cold-blooded killer is trumped by his over-the-top nuttiness.  Subtlety is not the character's strong point!  And I'm not sure what's going on with him but he appears to have been on a hunger strike since Lost went off the air.  He looks positively anorexic and unhealthy.John C. McGinley plays Cross's commanding officer Captain Brookwell and he's equally horrible.  As a native of the Detroit area I can tell you that a dimwit like this wouldn't last a week in the city.  Burns is always solid in supporting roles although he isn't given much to do here.  Cicely Tyson plays Cross's grandmother and she's also enjoyable.  It's nice to see Tyson back onscreen in recent years after she had mostly been absent from films for some 20 years.Tim Janson, Mania Entertainment",2,Tyler Perry is no Morgan Freeman,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,3197,"['Alex', 'Cross', 'third', 'film', 'feature', 'title', 'character', 'star', 'best-selling', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'series', 'novels', 'written', 'James', 'Patterson', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'character', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'time', 'played', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'reboot/prequel', 'Cross', 'forensic', 'psychologist', 'FBI', 'film', 'not', 'joined', 'FBI', 'yet', 'still', 'lieutenant', 'Detroit', 'Police', 'Department', 'Cross', 'offered', 'job', 'FBI', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'reluctant', 'move', 'Washington', 'D.C.Fox', 'team', 'Tommy', 'Burns', 'Monica', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'are', 'investigating', 'murderer', 'who', 'targeting', 'several', 'extremely', 'wealthy', 'targets', 'are', 'able', 'thwart', 'attempt', 'life', 'German', 'businessman', 'retaliation', 'killer', 'who', 'Picasso', 'Fox', 'attention', 'Cross', 'team', 'sadistic', 'Picasso', 'first', 'murders', 'Cross', 'wife', 'then', 'tortures', 'kills', 'Monica', 'who', 'was', 'Tommy', 'lover.Cross', 'Tommy', 'now', 'risk', 'careers', 'breaking', 'Detroit', 'Police', 'evidence', 'lockup', 'order', 'get', 'information', 'need', 'hunt', 'down', 'Picasso', 'can', 'take', 'out', 'last', 'wealthy', 'victim', 'billionaire', 'named', 'Giles', 'Mercier', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'disappear.Cross', 'one', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'type', 'minds', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'deductions', 'most', 'scant', 'pieces', 'evidence', 'problem', 'Rob', 'Cohen', 'almost', 'Cross', 'superhuman', 'level', 'intuition', 'fluffball', 'script', 'Cross', 'just', 'figure', 'everything', 'out', 'effort', 'rationalize', 'how', 'did', 'so', 'end', 'up', 'guy', 'who', 'smartest', 'guy', 'room', 'going', 'up', 'sadistic', 'nutcase', 'bizarre', 'series', 'silly', 'cat', 'mouse', 'contests', 'Picasso', 'one', 'jump', 'ahead', 'Cross', 'around', 'car', 'equipped', 'Onstar', 'be', 'tracked.It', 'sort', 'wild', 'inconsistency', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'shoot', 'foot', 'stopped', 'off', 'utterly', 'stupid', 'twist', 'ending', 'would', 'hazard', 'guess', 'Picasso', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'long', 'career', 'hitman', 'being', 'so', 'easily', 'upset', 'sight', 'main', 'target', 'begin', 'vendetta', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'Perry', 'talented', 'writer', 'producer', 'less', 'so', 'actor', 'particularly', 'dramatic', 'thriller', 'such', 'far', 'too', 'wooden', 'range', 'emotions', 'almost', 'nonexistent.Matthew', 'Fox', 'little', 'better', 'psychotic', 'hitman', 'Fox', 'attempt', 'come', 'off', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'trumped', 'over-the-top', 'nuttiness', 'Subtlety', 'not', 'character', 'strong', 'point', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'have', 'been', 'hunger', 'strike', 'Lost', 'went', 'air', 'positively', 'anorexic', 'unhealthy.John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'Cross', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Captain', 'Brookwell', 'equally', 'horrible', 'native', 'Detroit', 'area', 'can', 'tell', 'dimwit', 'would', ""n't"", 'last', 'week', 'city', 'Burns', 'always', 'solid', 'supporting', 'roles', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'do', 'here', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'Cross', 'grandmother', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'nice', 'see', 'Tyson', 'back', 'onscreen', 'recent', 'years', 'had', 'mostly', 'been', 'absent', 'films', '20', 'years.Tim', 'Janson', 'Mania', 'Entertainment']",N/A

The film's biggest problem is its weak screenplay that doesn't offer us anything fresh or original, and the lackluster direction of Rob Cohen, who did far better jobs in ""The Fast and The Furious"" and ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story."" With the film's sluggish pace and lack of suspense, it seems he is not really interested in making the story compelling. Supporting players including Edward Burns, Jean Reno and Cicely Tyson are all wasted.""Alex Cross"" is an attempt of Hollywood studios to reboot the Alex Cross series, but the result is only a dull and generic action movie. Two previous Alex Cross movies ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider"" were not particularly great, but with charismatic Morgan Freeman as the protagonist they were not boring, which ""Alex Cross"" exactly is.",2,Alex Cross Returns in Generic Thriller,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1414,"['Tyler', 'Perry', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'Detroit', 'police', 'detective', 'doctorate', 'abnormal', 'psychology', 'Created', 'James', 'Patterson', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'unique', 'person', 'family', 'man', 'highly', 'trained', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes-like', 'abilities', 'observation', 'deduction', 'new', 'film', 'pushed', 'edge', 'when', 'sadistic', 'serial', 'killer', 'Picasso', 'very', 'chilling', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'penchant', 'torture', 'town', 'interesting', 'reality', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'just', 'run-of-the-mill', 'thriller.Tyler', 'Perry', 'nominated', 'Razzie', 'role', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'either', 'film', 'biggest', 'problem', 'weak', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'fresh', 'original', 'lackluster', 'direction', 'Rob', 'Cohen', 'who', 'did', 'far', 'better', 'jobs', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Dragon', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Story', 'film', 'sluggish', 'pace', 'lack', 'suspense', 'not', 'really', 'interested', 'making', 'story', 'compelling', 'Supporting', 'players', 'including', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'are', 'wasted', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'attempt', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'reboot', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'series', 'result', 'only', 'dull', 'generic', 'action', 'movie', 'Two', 'previous', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'movies', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'Along', 'Came', 'Spider', 'were', 'not', 'particularly', 'great', 'charismatic', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'protagonist', 'were', 'not', 'boring', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'exactly']",N/A

Matthew Fox plays a crazed psychopathic killer who looks like a cross between Michael Stipe and Lance Armstrong.

Now, I can just see some country broad who loves this movie, sticking her chest out as wide as she can, getting ready to smear her lipstick for the 5th time in the day, with such a challenge as, ""OH, well who the HELL died and made YOU the Alex Cross expert,"" wiggling her oversized chest in the process? Well, I'll tell you right now who died, and his name is ALEX CROSS!!! Why do I have the nerve and the right to make such a statement? Because I happen to be READING the Alex Cross series by James Patterson, and this just makes me sick!Before I really start to piss people off, maybe I should actually give the good points of the movie.#1: Alex Cross is black. They actually got that part right. But it's funny, I had a black female friend tell me last night that SHE thought this sucked too, and she's trying to get her husband to see that as well.#2: The bad guy's actually bad. He's ruthless. They got that right too.#3: Alex loves his family.Now, time to piss off the people who truly LOVE this movie, because I'm about to rain down some hell on Tyler Perry's latest. This is the bad!#1: This movie is so messed up to a James Patterson and Alex Cross fan, the plot doesn't even make sense. Yes, Alex is a family man in this, but not even once does he come off as a thinker, like he does in Patterson's books. He comes off as Madea taking off the Madea mask, and just looking plain freaked out most of the time. In the books, Alex Cross uses his brain, and lets his street smarts do the talking, and he uses his boxing a lot of the time to bring opponents down before bringing out the guns.#2: Where's John Sampson? Funny, because he was in KISS THE GIRLS, and the role was played perfectly. The only thing that Sampson didn't do during KISS THE GIRLS was refer to Alex as ""Sugar,"" which is a pet nickname for Sampson. In ALEX CROSS, there isn't even the THOUGHT of John Sampson! That's just plain stupid. Outright stupidity.#3: In the book, it really doesn't take long for Maria to get killed, then for Alex's life to go to the present. In this? It's ALL in the present. Well, that's kinda dumb. This book this is based off of, CROSS, or ALEX CROSS, happens to be book #12 in the series, and Patterson refuses to fudge by making this an early Alex Cross story. It's the story of a killer attacking TODAY, and the killer being Maria's killer.#4: I'm here to tell you that if the REAL Nana Mama were to watch this, she'd probably slap the director before she invited him in for coffee. Cicely Tyson has some talent, but she ain't no Nana Mama. No way, no how.#5: Alex gets on his partner's case for sleeping with another female detective. That's Tyler Perry talking, because Alex can't keep it in his pants most of the time, especially when he gets a new female partner from the force. At least that's the case some of the time.#6: As far as the piano playing goes, it happens to be Alex's way of winding down. In this, Alex shows his daughter how to do some piece and make it better, but he never really tags out anything on his own. Alex Cross in the books is a maestro!#7: It all just plain sucks, and that's the way it is.So, in saying all of that, I really don't know what I was supposed to be watching. Because it certainly wasn't Alex Cross on camera. It was more like Alex WHO, and I'm just glad it was inter-library loaned, and that no money was wasted on this crap!",1,Alex WHO???,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,3507,"['was', 'bull', 'as', 'much', 'dignity', 'might', 'want', 'muster', 'plain', 'sucked', 'should', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'made', 'movie', 'Now', 'can', 'just', 'see', 'country', 'broad', 'who', 'movie', 'sticking', 'chest', 'out', 'as', 'wide', 'can', 'getting', 'ready', 'smear', 'lipstick', '5th', 'time', 'day', 'challenge', 'OH', 'well', 'who', 'HELL', 'died', 'made', 'YOU', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'expert', 'wiggling', 'oversized', 'chest', 'process', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'right', 'now', 'who', 'died', 'name', 'ALEX', 'CROSS', 'Why', 'do', 'have', 'nerve', 'right', 'make', 'such', 'statement', 'happen', 'be', 'READING', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'series', 'James', 'Patterson', 'just', 'sick', 'really', 'start', 'piss', 'people', 'off', 'maybe', 'should', 'actually', 'give', 'good', 'points', 'movie.', '1', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'black', 'actually', 'got', 'part', 'right', 'funny', 'had', 'black', 'female', 'friend', 'tell', 'last', 'night', 'SHE', 'thought', 'sucked', 'too', 'trying', 'get', 'husband', 'see', 'as', 'well.', '2', 'bad', 'guy', 'actually', 'bad', 'ruthless', 'got', 'right', 'too.', '3', 'Alex', 'family.Now', 'time', 'piss', 'off', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'LOVE', 'movie', ""'m"", 'rain', 'down', 'hell', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'latest', 'bad', '1', 'movie', 'so', 'messed', 'up', 'James', 'Patterson', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'fan', 'plot', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'Yes', 'Alex', 'family', 'man', 'not', 'even', 'once', 'come', 'off', 'thinker', 'Patterson', 'books', 'off', 'Madea', 'taking', 'off', 'Madea', 'mask', 'just', 'looking', 'plain', 'freaked', 'out', 'most', 'time', 'books', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'brain', 'street', 'smarts', 'do', 'talking', 'boxing', 'lot', 'time', 'bring', 'opponents', 'down', 'before', 'bringing', 'out', 'guns.', '2', 'Where', 'John', 'Sampson', 'Funny', 'was', 'KISS', 'THE', 'GIRLS', 'role', 'was', 'played', 'perfectly', 'only', 'thing', 'Sampson', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'KISS', 'THE', 'GIRLS', 'was', 'refer', 'Alex', 'Sugar', 'pet', 'nickname', 'Sampson', 'ALEX', 'CROSS', ""n't"", 'even', 'THOUGHT', 'John', 'Sampson', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'Outright', 'stupidity.', '3', 'book', 'really', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'Maria', 'get', 'killed', 'then', 'Alex', 'life', 'go', 'present', 'ALL', 'present', 'Well', 'kinda', 'dumb', 'book', 'based', 'CROSS', 'ALEX', 'CROSS', 'be', 'book', '12', 'series', 'Patterson', 'fudge', 'making', 'early', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'story', 'story', 'killer', 'attacking', 'TODAY', 'killer', 'being', 'Maria', 'killer.', '4', ""'m"", 'here', 'tell', 'REAL', 'Nana', 'Mama', 'were', 'watch', ""'d"", 'probably', 'slap', 'director', 'invited', 'coffee', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'talent', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Nana', 'Mama', 'way', 'how.', '5', 'Alex', 'partner', 'case', 'sleeping', 'female', 'detective', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'talking', 'Alex', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'pants', 'most', 'time', 'especially', 'when', 'new', 'female', 'partner', 'force', 'least', 'case', 'time.', '6', 'As', 'far', 'piano', 'playing', 'be', 'Alex', 'way', 'winding', 'down', 'Alex', 'daughter', 'how', 'do', 'piece', 'make', 'better', 'never', 'really', 'tags', 'out', 'anything', 'own', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'books', 'maestro', '7', 'just', 'plain', 'sucks', 'way', 'saying', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'watching', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'Alex', 'Cross', 'camera', 'was', 'more', 'Alex', 'WHO', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'was', 'inter-library', 'loaned', 'money', 'was', 'wasted', 'crap']",N/A
