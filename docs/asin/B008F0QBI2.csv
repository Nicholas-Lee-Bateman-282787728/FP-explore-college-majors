1551312,A35NVI7X5JM0LB,B008F0QBI2,Dusty Taylor,"[6, 7]","In the year 2000, the BBC launched a true crowning achievement for their company and the industry that is historical documentary. They produced &#34;A History of Britain.&#34; From that came a true template for what made a documentary worthy of the story it was trying to tell. It was honest. It was real. It allowed for self-congratulation to it's people, but it never once shied away from the grim realities of a time-line of poor decisions. Nevertheless, AHB did manage to focus primarily on England's story. And this is not to say that the Scottish, Welsh, and Irish in particular were left from the story -- no, but that merely it almost seemed like the history as the English saw it. To that end, in the decade that followed the BBC saw a potential to fine tune the delivery in provincial attempts, i.e. &#34;Story of Wales.&#34; I liked the presentation. But perhaps because AHB and &#34;A History of Scotland&#34; spoiled me so much, I was ready for an epic. I was ready for a journey that had me, as a viewer, as a scholar touch face with the different eras in way where I could and would feel somewhere deep in my soul a true sense of Welshness - of wanting for them what they wanted for themselves. It was that unique feeling that both Simon Schama and Neil Oliver were able to expertly craft in their telling of the national sagas of a people, but Hew Edward seemed more like a Welsh face for a Welsh series. To that end, sadly, it only seemed an asterisk to the general disposition by others for the Welsh, that being the quaint other in a land no longer deemed theirs.",3,Wailing for Wales.,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,1582,"['year', '2000', 'BBC', 'launched', 'true', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'company', 'industry', 'historical', 'documentary', 'produced', '34', 'A', 'History', 'Britain.', '34', 'came', 'true', 'template', 'what', 'made', 'documentary', 'worthy', 'story', 'was', 'trying', 'tell', 'was', 'honest', 'was', 'real', 'allowed', 'self-congratulation', 'people', 'never', 'once', 'shied', 'away', 'grim', 'realities', 'time-line', 'poor', 'decisions', 'Nevertheless', 'AHB', 'did', 'manage', 'focus', 'primarily', 'England', 'story', 'not', 'say', 'Scottish', 'Welsh', 'Irish', 'particular', 'were', 'left', 'story', 'merely', 'almost', 'seemed', 'history', 'English', 'saw', 'end', 'decade', 'followed', 'BBC', 'saw', 'potential', 'fine', 'delivery', 'provincial', 'attempts', 'i.e', '34', 'Story', 'Wales.', '34', 'liked', 'presentation', 'perhaps', 'AHB', '34', 'A', 'History', 'Scotland', '34', 'spoiled', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'ready', 'epic', 'was', 'ready', 'journey', 'had', 'viewer', 'scholar', 'touch', 'face', 'different', 'eras', 'way', 'where', 'could', 'would', 'feel', 'somewhere', 'deep', 'soul', 'true', 'sense', 'Welshness', 'wanting', 'what', 'wanted', 'was', 'unique', 'feeling', 'Simon', 'Schama', 'Neil', 'Oliver', 'were', 'able', 'expertly', 'craft', 'telling', 'national', 'sagas', 'people', 'Hew', 'Edward', 'seemed', 'more', 'Welsh', 'face', 'Welsh', 'series', 'end', 'sadly', 'only', 'seemed', 'asterisk', 'general', 'disposition', 'others', 'Welsh', 'being', 'quaint', 'other', 'land', 'no', 'longer', 'deemed', 'theirs']",N/A

Her he takes us through 30 000 years of Welsh history to demonstrate with the use of filmography of the beautiful Welsh landscape of deep landscape of broad low mountains and deep green valleys and picturesqe Welsh towns and cities. As well as well acted dramatic sketches.It takes us from prehistoric times through Roman occupation and the Viking and Anglo-Saxon harrowing of that country through the resistance to English domination led by Welsh princes.Wales involvement in the Wars of the Roses and the seizure of power by a welsh born nobleman Henry Tudor as King at Bosworth in 1485 are here presented.So with the moulding of Wales into the United Kingdom, the boom of the Industrial Revolutions and the terrible deprivations suffered by the Welsh working classes, leading to a series of riots and struggles for better conditions including the struggle of the Chartists and the Rebecca uprisings.Britain in the 19th century was a kingdom divided. 'Two nations'Disraeli called it-the rich and the poor. And nowhere was there greater deprivation than Wales. Eventually the workers begain to protest their appalling conditions, their pitiful wages, their homes that were breeding grounds for such virulent diseases that two out of three children were dead before they reached the age of five.As the profits of the colliery and ironworks owners rose, so the plight of their labour plunged to horrific depths.Eventually through two world wars and a Welsh Prime Minister David Lloyd George, a happier time was to be seen beginning in 1945 with the election of a Labour government and the creation of the benevolent welfare state, a key architect being the Welsh Labour politician Aneuran Bevan, one of the few politicians in British history who really had the welfare of the people at heart.Continues with Welsh struggles to keep their language alive and ends with the referendum of 1998 approving a Welsh parliament. Helps us to understand how the Weksh have been forged into the doughty and proud people they are and how Wales kept alive its own language , literature and traditions for over 500 years of Union with England",5,Fascinating,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,2263,"['very', 'exciting', 'expertly', 'presented', 'history', 'documentary', 'Welsh', 'historian', 'Huw', 'Edwards', 'who', 'be', 'master', 'presenter', '30', '000', 'years', 'Welsh', 'history', 'demonstrate', 'use', 'filmography', 'beautiful', 'Welsh', 'landscape', 'deep', 'landscape', 'broad', 'low', 'mountains', 'deep', 'green', 'valleys', 'picturesqe', 'Welsh', 'towns', 'cities', 'As', 'well', 'well', 'acted', 'dramatic', 'sketches.It', 'prehistoric', 'times', 'Roman', 'occupation', 'Viking', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'harrowing', 'country', 'resistance', 'English', 'domination', 'led', 'Welsh', 'princes.Wales', 'involvement', 'Wars', 'Roses', 'seizure', 'power', 'welsh', 'born', 'nobleman', 'Henry', 'Tudor', 'King', 'Bosworth', '1485', 'are', 'here', 'presented.So', 'moulding', 'Wales', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'boom', 'Industrial', 'Revolutions', 'terrible', 'deprivations', 'suffered', 'Welsh', 'working', 'classes', 'leading', 'series', 'riots', 'struggles', 'better', 'conditions', 'including', 'struggle', 'Chartists', 'Rebecca', 'uprisings.Britain', '19th', 'century', 'was', 'kingdom', 'divided', ""nations'Disraeli"", 'called', 'it-the', 'rich', 'poor', 'nowhere', 'was', 'there', 'greater', 'deprivation', 'Wales', 'Eventually', 'workers', 'begain', 'protest', 'appalling', 'conditions', 'pitiful', 'wages', 'homes', 'were', 'breeding', 'grounds', 'such', 'virulent', 'diseases', 'two', 'three', 'children', 'were', 'dead', 'reached', 'age', 'five.As', 'profits', 'colliery', 'ironworks', 'owners', 'rose', 'plight', 'labour', 'plunged', 'horrific', 'depths.Eventually', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'Welsh', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'David', 'Lloyd', 'George', 'happier', 'time', 'was', 'be', 'seen', 'beginning', '1945', 'election', 'Labour', 'government', 'creation', 'benevolent', 'welfare', 'state', 'key', 'architect', 'being', 'Welsh', 'Labour', 'politician', 'Aneuran', 'Bevan', 'one', 'few', 'politicians', 'British', 'history', 'who', 'really', 'had', 'welfare', 'people', 'heart.Continues', 'Welsh', 'struggles', 'keep', 'language', 'alive', 'referendum', '1998', 'approving', 'Welsh', 'parliament', 'understand', 'how', 'Weksh', 'have', 'been', 'forged', 'doughty', 'proud', 'people', 'are', 'how', 'Wales', 'kept', 'alive', 'own', 'language', 'literature', 'traditions', '500', 'years', 'Union', 'England']",N/A

It's pretty fascinating and very informative. The dvd's picture looks pretty good too. This show tells Wales social , and political history starting back to 30,000 B.C. It covers a lot of time in each episode. We do get some of the most important Welsh heroes and kings names and stories here. And we do get a sense of the culture of the area through the ages. One thing that cannot be argued though , is that wales has in the long run benefited from being part of the U.K. and the current devolutionists who want their own country have lost sight of the fact that they are part of the interconnected culture of the U.K. ; as much as part of wales Today. Which is why it would be idiotic to split off. we have enough small impoverished countries. Culturally wales ahs a lot to be proud of and you will learn about this as the six hour show progresses. Richard Burton was from wales and of course the Tudor Dynasty was from there as well. This show will give you a layman's knowledge of the Welsh and Wales and it's done in a entertaining way.  there's not a boring moment in this one , and the early episodes are probably the best.",5,excellent history that comes alive.,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,1250,"['well', 'done', 'history', 'wales', 'Which', 'part', 'United', 'kingdom', 'been', 'so', '1200', 'basically', 'pretty', 'fascinating', 'very', 'informative', 'dvd', 'picture', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'show', 'Wales', 'social', 'political', 'history', 'starting', 'back', '30,000', 'B.C', 'lot', 'time', 'episode', 'do', 'get', 'most', 'important', 'Welsh', 'heroes', 'kings', 'names', 'stories', 'here', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'culture', 'area', 'ages', 'One', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'argued', 'wales', 'long', 'run', 'benefited', 'being', 'part', 'U.K.', 'current', 'devolutionists', 'who', 'want', 'own', 'country', 'have', 'lost', 'sight', 'fact', 'are', 'part', 'interconnected', 'culture', 'U.K.', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'wales', 'Today', 'Which', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'idiotic', 'split', 'off', 'have', 'enough', 'small', 'impoverished', 'countries', 'Culturally', 'lot', 'be', 'proud', 'will', 'learn', 'about', 'six', 'hour', 'show', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'was', 'wales', 'course', 'Tudor', 'Dynasty', 'was', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'will', 'give', 'layman', 'knowledge', 'Welsh', 'Wales', 'done', 'entertaining', 'way', 'not', 'boring', 'moment', 'one', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'probably', 'best']",N/A
