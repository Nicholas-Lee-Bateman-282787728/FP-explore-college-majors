1640619,A2DI9XP5ITS3P,B00BX8PG4S,"Allegrobas ""Allegrobas""","[0, 1]","Well-written suspense thriller about a Soviet nuclear sub and its captain's power struggle with a KGB agent on board for control of the sub. Ed Harris does a great job as the captain who suffers from epilepsy and who has flashbacks about a tragedy aboard one of his ships. The suspense builds as the KGB agent (played well by David Duchovny)  gets increasingly more control of the sub and perhaps of the nuclear missile onboard. Great acting by all, good build up of tension and suspense. But, as other reviewers have said, the end is totally out of character with the film's depiction of sweaty realism---it resorted to some sort of fantasy world so that audiences can achieve some vicarious satisfaction through the families of the servicemen. (It reminded me of the ending of Edge of Darkness with Mel Gibson, where we see the father and daughter strolling out of the hospital, side by side, even though both had already died!). Besides this strange ending, everything else was excellent.

The quality feels a little better than something made for TV, but not on par with a big release.  First off, everyone is supposed to be Russian...  No one even tries an accent or anything.  There are plenty of good Russian actors that could have been cast for this movie, but of course then no one would have seen it.  Once you get past the lack of Russian complaint, the movie is not bad.  I was entertained through the whole movie.  The climax of the movie, and the ending were not the best.

1640622,A2H1DWEYO980JV,B00BX8PG4S,Andrew Masters,"[1, 2]","I bought this DVD on the basis of previous reviews and whilst I did 'somewhat' enjoy watching it, I felt that it was by no means the ""absolute thriller"" and ""awesome cold war"" movie that such reports portrayed. David Dushovny's first appearance was simply embarassing (due mainly to his appalling attempt to speak with a Russian accent)and his acting was very VERY wooden - HOWEVER - to his credit his acting slowly grew on you and towards the end he did finally portray a reasonably good (SPOILER......) evil man - not his best work that I've seen (2.5/10)The fact that all the Russian's were portayed by American actors, who constantly spoke with American idioms (ie saying the word ""crewmate"" instead of ""comrade"" which is a Russian verb at its purest) detracted from this movie and indicated the glaring inadequacies liberally sprinkled throught this film. This film could have been an excellent 5 star movie indeed; it portrayed a little known cold war atomic (not nucular) 'missadventure' that could have nastly blown out to cause WW3 - on an atomic scale (parden the pun). With such an interesting topic to create a film around its a pity that not enough was done to develop more authentic aspects to carry the film just that much further in the enjoyment factor. Ed Harris (8/10)- well I can't remember a bad film he has ever done and in PHANTOM he quite literally carries the whole move on his shoulders (if Ed was missing I shudder to think of how bad this film would have actually been).PHANTOM is a somewhat enjoyable film; the actors make it worthwhile watching and its one easily watched, but so much the better if you know/understand the context of the time(s) and socio-political background when this 'incident' occured as it helps to brush over the short-comings of the film.

The first is I am used to being with Russians, and these people did not act like Russians. More importantly like officers in the Russian navy during the communist era. I doubt American officers would behave like these guys do much less Communist era officers.Nor did the submarine look like a USSR submarine of the period. I know I have been in one. Clearly it was not well researched the movie.As the plot developed, the almost guilt-ridden  captain story became more implausible. Okay the captain was responsible for a minor naval disaster which killed about eight people, but life goes on. I can remember reading of an Israeli tank commander who made a bad mistake, and a man in his group died by accident. He did not go overboard like this captain, and he was in a society which is super sensitive on this sort of stuff. Hardly, something the old USSR military or society was. I used to work in a plant that had an industrial death every few months, and I can assure you industrial and military accidents happen all the time; you get used to them.Having said that the story is reasonable for a movie, it is not all that original.

Neither he nor his crew are particularly happy about it, nor are they excited to take on some new men, whose purposes are mysterious and whose background is questionable.  Before long, Demi begins to realize how strange things really are, and that his sub may be the last thing standing in the way of nuclear war.PHANTOM is a decent little thriller, though it has its flaws.  The one catching the most flack is that Russian soldiers generally speak Russian in Russian accents.  But whatever.  If that's your biggest gripe about the film, then you're missing the point of fictionalized entertainment.  There are bigger issues of logic, plotting, and pace at hand; the film bogs down a bit, and then rushes towards its conclusion.  By the end, it becomes a different film altogether (which makes one think how truly good PHANTOM could've been, if had stuck with this more cerebral tone all along).However, one major thing PHANTOM has going in its favor is the caliber of acting on hand.  Ed Harris gives a reliably solid turn, with William Fichtner matching him step for step as Demi's second-in-command and best friend.  David Duchovny gives a surprisingly good performance as the ambiguous Bruni (there are no straight up villains in this film, yet another thing going in its favor; everyone has reasons for why they do what they do).  The supporting cast is also game, particularly Johnathon Shcaech as a confused political officer, and the great Lance Henriksen in a brief but memorable role.  The acting carries this film; the final few scenes, as well as brief scenes throughout the film, make you wonder how good PHANTOM could've been; but overall, if you're looking for something to kill an hour and a half, you could do far worse.",3,3.5 stars: a decent little thriller,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,1833,"['Demi', 'Soviet', 'captain', 'prime', 'been', 'given', 'command', 'outdated', 'diesel', 'submarine', 'crew', 'are', 'particularly', 'happy', 'are', 'excited', 'take', 'new', 'men', 'purposes', 'are', 'mysterious', 'background', 'questionable', 'long', 'Demi', 'realize', 'how', 'strange', 'things', 'really', 'are', 'sub', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'thing', 'standing', 'way', 'nuclear', 'war.PHANTOM', 'decent', 'little', 'thriller', 'flaws', 'one', 'catching', 'most', 'flack', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'generally', 'speak', 'Russian', 'Russian', 'accents', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'film', 'then', ""'re"", 'missing', 'point', 'fictionalized', 'entertainment', 'are', 'bigger', 'issues', 'logic', 'plotting', 'pace', 'hand', 'film', 'bogs', 'down', 'bit', 'then', 'towards', 'conclusion', 'end', 'different', 'film', 'altogether', 'one', 'think', 'how', 'truly', 'good', 'PHANTOM', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', 'stuck', 'more', 'cerebral', 'tone', '.However', 'one', 'major', 'thing', 'PHANTOM', 'going', 'favor', 'caliber', 'acting', 'hand', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'reliably', 'solid', 'turn', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'matching', 'step', 'step', 'Demi', 'second-in-command', 'best', 'friend', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'ambiguous', 'Bruni', 'are', 'straight', 'up', 'villains', 'film', 'yet', 'thing', 'going', 'favor', 'everyone', 'reasons', 'why', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'game', 'particularly', 'Johnathon', 'Shcaech', 'confused', 'political', 'officer', 'great', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'brief', 'memorable', 'role', 'acting', 'film', 'final', 'few', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'brief', 'scenes', 'film', 'make', 'wonder', 'how', 'good', 'PHANTOM', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'overall', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'kill', 'hour', 'half', 'could', 'do', 'far', 'worse']",N/A

I'm not talking about the drum-beating variety; rather, I'm talking about stories that focused on characters with a commitment to whatever country they served, and these characters would then be allowed to carry out their mission at whatever the cost.  That's the stuff audiences typically embrace - not these veiled anti-war, anti-American, anti-decency dramatic potboilers.  If you'd told me twenty years ago that I'd have to watch a film about a Soviet submarine captain who does what's necessary to save all of humanity in order to have that thirst for solid military drama sated, then I would've told you to drop down and give me twenty.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.

If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)In the late 60's, a battle-tested Soviet submarine captain nearing the end of his career, Demi (played by the reliable Ed Harris) returns to base only to find out he's been assigned to command a relic: an old diesel sub is on the verge of being retired and sold to the Chinese for their new navy.  His senior officer thinks it apropos that Demi - who first captained the sub - see it through on its last mission, and, a consummate professional, he agrees.  However, once they're out to see, Demi finds his authority usurped a KGB officer, Bruni (David Duchovny), who's intent on using the ship to test a new naval weapon known only as `Phantom.'  Once it becomes clear that Bruni is privately committed to launching a nuclear warhead at the US's Pacific Fleet, Demi fights his own personal demons on his bid to retake the sub with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.PHANTOM is a smartly written and expertly directed project (credit Todd Robinson for both) that's entirely based on true events.  In fact, the Soviet sub that went down in the late 60's has been raised and recovered, but, until this day, both the Russian government and the U.S. protect its records at the highest level of classification.  As I said in my opening, I'm a sucker for a good, patriotic actioner - regardless of who is calling the shots - and this one was pretty spectacular.At the center of it all is some exceptional photography with sets depicting diesel sub interiors of the era.  Everything is tightly shot by design, and the lighting and period detail only adds to the visual drama.  Furthermore, the production is held up on Harris's capable shoulders; he plays the captain with tremendous reserve (until fisticuffs become necessary), and that's because the script brilliant shackles the character with some personal baggage that takes the shape of some very dark secrets.  He's also suffering from a physical condition - one that he's kept from those closest to him - that plays heavily into the second half.To add to the expertise, Robinson brought in a stable of familiar and highly-skilled actors to add even more gravitas to the project.  The exceptional William Fichtner plays Alex, the sub's executive officer.  Lance Henriksen appears briefly as Admiral Markov - the officer who tasks Demi with this mission (and them suffers his own dark comeuppance).  Johnathon Schaech - while shackled under a mustache honestly too thick for his face - also serves under Harris's captain, and Jason Beghe as Semak earns stripes as the ship's doctor.  A personal long-time favorite of mine since his stint as Indiana Jones on television, Sean Patrick Flanery shows up as weapon's expert Tyrtov.If PHANTOM has any failings, I'd have to point my finger at its uncharacteristically schmaltzy ending, which sacrifices the gritty reality of the first 90 minutes for a saccharin and sappy closing scene that serves no real purpose other than to bring in a few, fresh faces to cleanse the palate of all the film's sweaty manliness.  It was entirely unnecessary - I'm not sure what Robinson was thinking when he wrote it - and it could've been played several different ways that wouldn't have pitched reality out the window in favor of a few minutes of benign fantasy.PHANTOM is produced by RCR Media Group, Trilogy Entertainment Group, and Solar Filmworks.  DVD distribution is being handled through 20th Century Fox.  As for the technical specifications, I'm willing to guess no expense was spared in bringing this tale of seasoned bravery to life; it's filled with constantly claustrophic cinematography aboard a Soviet diesel submarine, and it looks marvelous.  (Having toured two Cold War subs similar to the sets used in this film, I thought it extremely accurate in its depictions.)  Lastly, the Blu-ray package offers up the real deal: along with the film there's a digital copy that you can watch anywhere; three production shorts; a music video; and an audio commentary.  Bravo to all involved for pitching in with some impressive extras!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Before Hollywood went all political with its military thrillers, it served up classic-style heroes - old soldiers, old captain, old warriors - who knew a thing or two about facing the odds and saving the world.  Despite a curiously sentimental, fantastical ending, PHANTOM remains a tautly plotted motion picture are big men facing bigger odds.  Based on true events (and probably a fair amount of screenwriter tinkering), the story focuses in on a battle of wills between an aging relic of Soviet supremacy (Ed Harris) and a KGB operative (David Duchovny) who'll stop at nothing to set the world on a path to global apocalypse.  It'd be easy to quip some of the minor details, but PHANTOM is man's entertainment, and there ain't no bones about that.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at RCR Media Group and 20th Century Fox provided me with a DVD copy of PHANTOM by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,PHANTOM Is A Smart Cold War Thriller,1372118400,"06 25,

The description on the DVD case made the story seem fantastically interesting. I had to see this film. It's a simple but incredible premise. Rogue agents from take over control of a Soviet submarine armed with nuclear missiles. We eventually learn what the ""Phantom"" is and its potential role in starting WW III and making the Soviets look like innocent players in the world scene. OK, sounds good but something gets totally lost in this film. The plot seems contrived and even another great performance by Ed Harris can save this film.PHANTOM takes place almost entirely inside a real Soviet submarine that is currently in San Diego, CA. The remarkable realism is overshadowed by the dark lighting of the film. It's often hard to see faces and background in the film though I commend the filmmakers on using a real submarine and not one created on a set.A film set in a submarine automatically creates a sensation of claustrophia for the actors and the viewers. The action only picks up near the end of the film when a crisis is approaching. I want to be vague about the plot but it certainly was not satisfying. It says something about a film when the bonus features are MUCH more interesting and informative than the movie. The opening of PHANTOM says it is ""inspired by true events"" and the bonus features explain the ""true events"", though we are still left to wonder what really happened to the submarine that ""inspired"" this movie.

A very enjoyable film packed with extras that are worth watching, especially in regards to the historical truths the movie is based upon. The metaphysical ending might confuse some but the visuals throughout the film lend to the 'haunted' aspect of the film.

1640649,A16XRPF40679KG,B00BX8PG4S,Michael Dobey,"[0, 0]","This is a low budget flick , and it's a good one. Mainly because of the strong acting of the cast. They are just EXCELLENT. Ed Harris has never put in a bad performance in his life; but the rest of the cast rises to the challenge here. This is drama and not a action flick really so VIDEO GAME IDIOTS WHO WANT constant action should avoid it probably.  Instead it is a tight drama based loosely on the story of the k-129. That sub did in fact go rogue and was taken over by the kgb. The crew sabotaged the nuke missle and it blew up and killed them all.  The kgb was trying to fire it on Hawaii. ANd they were trying to convince the americans that it was china doing it. That is very similar to this movie. I do believe the k129 deserves a monument for what they did too. This flick is great while it's in the sub as it's a real sub and that makes it more realistic.  the ending is more metaphysical or spiritual , but I didn't care as this was a good drama. And it made me think about the k-129 and what they did for all of us.  David ducoveny is outstanding in this too as the kgb rogue agent.  He gets more fanatical as the film moves on.  The computer generated effects are average here and would have been top notch 15 years ago, but you can forgive them that because they just had such a small budget. In fact models would have looked more realistic but that would have cost a lot more. So forgive them that and just enjoy the excellent acting.  And William fictner really helps this flick out too. He's another actor that never has given a bad performance. So that helps in this movie too.  I just hope that this movie inspires someone to create a monument to the crew of k -129 , they saved the world!

Conflict ensues between the captain and the KGB contingent as the captain (Harris) learns of the true intent of the KGB.

Zwick,"[0, 1]","Considering it deals with the possible annihilation of all life on the planet, you'd think ""Phantom,"" written and directed by Todd Robinson, would be a more interesting and compelling film than it turns out to be. Instead, it's an anachronistic Cold War tale that couldn't feel more remote and irrelevant to the world of today. And it doesn't help one bit that the story is based on some actual events that occurred in 1968.Ed Harris plays a veteran submarine captain for the Russian navy who's sent on a mysterious mission with some possibly rogue elite KGB agents on board. What they're up to is anyone's guess, but could it have something to do with wresting control of the ship's nuclear missile from the captain and the crew?Even if you can get past the rather disconcerting spectacle of a cast of all-American actors portraying unaccented Russians, you're still left with having to wade through a muddled story, the logistics of which are so arcane and esoteric that we often can't figure out what's going on (we just know by the actors' grim demeanor that it is all Very Very Serious).And just as you're about to give the movie credit for at least daring to show things from the other side of the Cold War, Harris delivers a speech so absurdly complimentary of the Americans that Thomas Paine himself could have written it. And just as you're about to congratulate it for not going for the obligatory deep dive/popping rivet scene, down we go to the bottom (in  more ways than one), as it all culminates in a scene that is so embarrassing it has to be seen to be believed.Harris does yeoman work in service to the cause, though David Duchovny is a bit stiff as a psychotic KGB operative.

One story was that the US sunk this ship. This movie presents a different version.The story is simple. The KGB goes rogue with a submarine with the intent of launching a first strike at the US, making it look like China did it. The film creates characters and internal conflicts to make the story interesting.Kudos to the film for getting the submarine terminology and capability correct. This aspect was more realistic than most sub films.There are some problems with the basic scenario. First off in 1968, China had only one Golf style submarine operational. It did NOT have launch capabilities. They wouldn't develop that until 1970. The second problem is that nuclear bombs have signature. We could figure out the difference between a crude Chinese graphite reactor bomb and a slightly more sophisticated Russian bomb. So the premise of the film while interesting, doesn't seem plausible.Another film goof was when they encountered the USS Skipjack. The Skipjack was stationed out of Norfolk and operated in that area in 1968. The submarine in the Pacific was the USS Swordfish, i.e. a Skipjack class sub, but not the Skipjack itself.The actors did what they could with a dry script. Landlubbers may find this film a complete bore and rightly so. We already know they fail. Extras include a talk about the real incident on which the film was based.Parental Guide: F-bomb.

1640669,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00BX8PG4S,Tommy Dooley,"[0, 0]","I am a massive Ed Harris fan so wanted to see this just beacuse he is in it. It is `based' on actual events that took place during The Cold War, when the nuclear stand off between America and Russia had us on the edges of our seats a few times and saw the emergence of CND, (now sadly reduced to a fashion logo). Ed Harris plays Demi the Captain of a diesel powered submarine with nuclear capability. He and his crew have just finished a lengthy mission when he is ordered back to sea.Demi has been suffering seizures from an earlier incident which left him with a head injury. His judgement is sometimes impaired and in good old naval tradition he uses rum to sort out the whole problem. As was the case in those days everyone has a political officer on board and his is actually a friend, however they are also accompanied by some very zealous KGB types who are going to test a top secret new weapon. The KGB are led by Bruni played by David `X-Files' Duchovny. It soon becomes apparent that the KGB are not all they seem to be and might just be going rogue, but as Harris and his men discuss; you only go rogue for two reasons, one is to defect and the other is to start a war; no one thinks these uber Communista types are about to start working for Uncle Sam, and so the scene is set for a rather good thriller.Now there are a few issues with this film that may turn some people off, for starters they are all supposed to be Russian and yet all speak with their normal accents which I know is fine but I would have liked a veiled attempt to at least pretend to pronounce all your `R's backwards etc or put in `ski' after a few things- still never mind. Then some of the scenes are a bit modern the port is so not 1968, they would have referred to each other as `comrade' and not `sir' etc. There is a full list for real anoraks on IMDB in case you are bothered.All of that said I still really enjoyed it, it was suspenseful, it was tense and there were some very good performances, Harris and Duchovny were brilliant as was one of my favourites Lance Henriksen as Markov who you may remember from `Millennium' or as the robot in `Aliens' or indeed `Aliens vs. Predators'. The production is generally impressive and everyone puts in solid performances and the time just flew by.

It was interesting to see so many actors who usually play All-American roles cast as Russians, with not a Soviet accent in the bunch.  Once that little hurdle was leaped (because I kept expecting it to crop up somewhere), this was different all the way. &#34;Based on actual events&#34; can mean a lot of things. Here it meant that in 1969, a Soviet sub went missing and was later discovered sunk with its nuclear torpedo missing. That's the basis for this film and the screen writer's literary extrapolation of how and why that event occurred. Maybe true or perhaps not. Either way, it's a tense, exciting story of a less-than sterling son still trying to live up to his formidable farther's military reputation while going on his last voyage before retiring. Definitely reminiscent of The Hunt for Red October with familiar faces throughout the cast.  My only complaint was the ending which traipsed without a clue from thriller into the metaphysical.

Ed Harris plays Demi, captain of the submarine. David Duchovny is a mysterious agent whose motive for accompanying the crew is not disclosed. But perhaps you will guess it right anyway.Despite its quiet and slow-moving start (with a cameo of Lance Henriksen), the film gets interesting once the submarine is underwater, but it never reaches the level of intensity you might expect. The cast all did a good job, including always reliable William Fichtner, but I really didn&#8217;t find the story interesting, as it was a bit predictable and familiar.Apparently &#8220;Phantom&#8221; is inspired by an actual incident of the Soviet submarine K-129 in 1968. A quick research on the internet will provide you with lots of information about what happened after the event itself (with one secret mission involving Howard Hughes), which is more interesting than the film&#8217;s entire storyline.Within a limited budget the filmmakers created a set of the inside of the Russian submarine where most major events take place. The set looks convincing to me though some of you may point out technical errors, which I am not particularly interested.
