From the pyramids, both in Egypt and in the Americas, to formations on the ground that can only be seen from the air, there's plenty to wonder about here.  Add to that the worldwide myths, which feature visitors of similar description, and it's all very compelling.  Just the technology of moving large stones seems impossible without outside help, since this technical capability has only been possible recently with large machines.  In particular I was fascinated by the Crystal Skull story, which I'd never heard before and early evidence of a nuclear blast in the middle of the Sinai Desert.  It's a straight-forward presentation, nothing fancy, and much of the visual material is nicely presented.  If you find this sort of thing sparks your imagination, you're in for a treat.",3,Compelling evidence,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,859,"['Philip', 'Coppens', 'evidence', 'previous', 'alien', 'visitations', 'pyramids', 'Egypt', 'Americas', 'formations', 'ground', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'air', 'plenty', 'wonder', 'here', 'Add', 'worldwide', 'myths', 'feature', 'visitors', 'similar', 'description', 'very', 'compelling', 'Just', 'technology', 'moving', 'large', 'stones', 'impossible', 'outside', 'help', 'technical', 'capability', 'only', 'been', 'possible', 'recently', 'large', 'machines', 'particular', 'was', 'fascinated', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'story', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'early', 'evidence', 'nuclear', 'blast', 'middle', 'Sinai', 'Desert', 'straight-forward', 'presentation', 'nothing', 'fancy', 'much', 'visual', 'material', 'nicely', 'presented', 'find', 'sort', 'thing', 'sparks', 'imagination', ""'re"", 'treat']",Ancient Alien Question: From UFOs to Extraterrestrial Visitations

1548409,A39F3K7RZPCT1B,B0088FS36M,The Rab,"[20, 21]","As a long-time fan of the hit series Ancient Aliens, I was hoping that this documentary would live up to the quality and thought-provoking material that AA currently presents.NOPE.I'm sure several people purchase this film solely based on the familiar face of Philip Coppens in hopes that this program will resemble Ancient Aliens.NOPE.Ancient Aliens star; Philip Coppens virtually provides no new theories or evidence that isn't already covered in Ancient Aliens.  The production is quite poor and there are definitely no attention-grabbers.  Keeping yourself awake during this film should be a personal achievement.  This 70-minute snooze fest is plain and flat.  The material is quite vague and never gets more in-depth than just being theories.  There are several topics that are featured in this documentary, but all lack the definitive hard-hitting counterpoints to conventional human evolution explainations.The study of ancient extraterrestrial contacts is rapidly becoming a mainstream fascination, but is being pursued by independent theorists without serious scientific backing.  We understand that everyone has their own opinion on what really happened during our remote past, but programs like this are not much help.For hardcore Ancient Aliens fans, stick with the real thing, this is a poor substitution.",2,Not an Ancient Aliens Substitute,1349308800,"10 4, 2012",2012,1319,"['long-time', 'fan', 'hit', 'series', 'Ancient', 'Aliens', 'was', 'hoping', 'documentary', 'would', 'live', 'up', 'quality', 'thought-provoking', 'material', 'AA', 'currently', ""'m"", 'sure', 'several', 'people', 'purchase', 'film', 'solely', 'based', 'familiar', 'face', 'Philip', 'Coppens', 'hopes', 'program', 'will', 'resemble', 'Ancient', 'Aliens.NOPE.Ancient', 'Aliens', 'star', 'Philip', 'Coppens', 'virtually', 'new', 'theories', 'evidence', ""n't"", 'already', 'covered', 'Ancient', 'Aliens', 'production', 'quite', 'poor', 'are', 'definitely', 'attention-grabbers', 'Keeping', 'awake', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'personal', 'achievement', '70-minute', 'snooze', 'fest', 'plain', 'flat', 'material', 'quite', 'vague', 'never', 'more', 'in-depth', 'just', 'being', 'theories', 'are', 'several', 'topics', 'are', 'featured', 'documentary', 'lack', 'definitive', 'hard-hitting', 'counterpoints', 'conventional', 'human', 'evolution', 'explainations.The', 'study', 'ancient', 'extraterrestrial', 'contacts', 'rapidly', 'becoming', 'mainstream', 'fascination', 'being', 'pursued', 'independent', 'theorists', 'serious', 'scientific', 'backing', 'understand', 'everyone', 'own', 'opinion', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'remote', 'past', 'programs', 'are', 'not', 'much', 'help.For', 'hardcore', 'Ancient', 'Aliens', 'fans', 'stick', 'real', 'thing', 'poor', 'substitution']",Ancient Alien Question: From UFOs to Extraterrestrial Visitations
