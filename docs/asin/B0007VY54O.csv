891931,A26KFC1T9BYQRX,B0007VY54O,charity sparks,"[9, 16]","Well first of all I feel everything in this movie happened too fast. First, she meets him at a dance, she declines his offer to have a dance with him. Yet, she goes on a date with him when he just pops up at her house. Next thing you know he's climbing through his bedroom window to have sex with her. She says no, but then stops refusing and sits there intrigued by his pretty eyes and his nice body as he undresses and climbs on top of her. Her macho dad finds him suspicious and her push over mom thinks they're in ""love"" and they get married. THEN the next scene she's having his baby and he beats her that same day. From then on after that it's a long resolution with Katie going on and on about how much she loved him. C'mon she was 18 right out of highschool he was probably her first real boyfriend. And he saw her as an easy catch with her innocence and naivety.She was so into her loser hubby that she couldn't see that nice cop Ed had a thing for her.Also I know it's typical with abuse victims but why didn't she say why she did it during the arrest??  It was so frustrating how she covered up for him and all she did was talk about how much she loved him. She couldn't have been much older than her early 20's. When Jimmy went to bed after pointing the gun to her face, she should've grabbed their kid and went to her house and told her dad who was a cop.  And why didn't her sister testify that she didn't tell because Katie was so distressed she was going to kill herself? That would've helped since the lawyer made making it seem like her sister kept quiet out of ignorance.Her dad also demeaned her mother and this is brought to the family's attention. I love Kellie Martin but her character in this movie was too naive and foolish, she was clearly using the judgement of a girl still in high school when she married this guy and covered up for him afraid to tell daddy because he wouldn't love her. (her dad might have been in denial at first being that he feels if he isn't aware of a problem it doesn't exist,but there were bruises to prove she was truthful, and he already disliked  Jimmy)Katie took things way too fast. She even looked like a little girl for God's sake when she had a child and one on the way.  And the way the neighbor stood by and looked on was ridiculous. The attempt to portray her as heartbroken and madly in love also shows she's too  young and naive to be in a marriage. I'm 17 and I wouldn't think I'm in love after one date, or let a guy have sex with me on the first date, let alone marry him shortly after highschool when I didn't even want to dance with him...let me just stop right here.",3,this gets me wondering........*Spoiler Alert*,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,2639,"['Well', 'first', 'feel', 'everything', 'movie', 'happened', 'too', 'fast', 'First', 'dance', 'offer', 'have', 'dance', 'date', 'when', 'just', 'up', 'house', 'Next', 'thing', 'know', 'climbing', 'bedroom', 'window', 'have', 'sex', 'then', 'refusing', 'sits', 'there', 'intrigued', 'pretty', 'eyes', 'nice', 'body', 'climbs', 'top', 'macho', 'dad', 'suspicious', 'push', 'mom', 'thinks', ""'re"", 'love', 'get', 'married', 'THEN', 'next', 'scene', 'having', 'baby', 'same', 'day', 'then', 'long', 'resolution', 'Katie', 'going', 'how', 'much', 'loved', ""C'mon"", 'was', '18', 'right', 'highschool', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'real', 'boyfriend', 'saw', 'easy', 'catch', 'innocence', 'naivety.She', 'was', 'so', 'loser', 'hubby', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'nice', 'cop', 'Ed', 'had', 'thing', 'her.Also', 'know', 'typical', 'abuse', 'victims', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'why', 'did', 'arrest', 'was', 'so', 'frustrating', 'how', 'covered', 'up', 'did', 'was', 'talk', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'much', 'older', 'early', '20', 'When', 'Jimmy', 'went', 'bed', 'pointing', 'gun', 'face', 'should', ""'ve"", 'grabbed', 'kid', 'went', 'house', 'told', 'dad', 'who', 'was', 'cop', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'sister', 'testify', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Katie', 'was', 'so', 'distressed', 'was', 'going', 'kill', 'would', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'lawyer', 'made', 'making', 'seem', 'sister', 'kept', 'quiet', 'ignorance.Her', 'dad', 'also', 'demeaned', 'mother', 'brought', 'family', 'attention', 'love', 'Kellie', 'Martin', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'naive', 'foolish', 'was', 'clearly', 'using', 'judgement', 'girl', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'married', 'guy', 'covered', 'up', 'afraid', 'tell', 'daddy', 'would', ""n't"", 'love', 'dad', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'denial', 'first', 'being', ""n't"", 'aware', 'problem', ""n't"", 'exist', 'were', 'bruises', 'prove', 'was', 'truthful', 'already', 'disliked', 'Jimmy', 'Katie', 'took', 'things', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'even', 'looked', 'little', 'girl', 'God', 'sake', 'when', 'had', 'child', 'one', 'way', 'way', 'neighbor', 'stood', 'looked', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'attempt', 'portray', 'heartbroken', 'madly', 'love', 'also', 'too', 'young', 'naive', 'be', 'marriage', ""'m"", '17', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'love', 'one', 'date', 'let', 'guy', 'have', 'sex', 'first', 'date', 'let', 'alone', 'marry', 'shortly', 'highschool', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'dance', 'let', 'just', 'stop', 'right', 'here']",If Someone Had Known

Part of the 'True Stories Collection', If Someone Had Known is a powerful, gripping tragedy. Keith is an oversized child unready to become a father even though he's married to Kim, who has always longed for children and is determined to adopt. When baby Brittany arrives in their lives Keith finds not only his carefree ways challenged, but a newfound love for his new daughter - a love shaken by the death of his wife from cancer, and by a court system determined to take away his baby before the adoption is complete. Teri Polo provides a gripping, believable protagonist as a young woman determined to have a child, and Andrew McCarthy as Keith is the perfect vision of a young father unprepared for the challenges of parenthood.",5,"A powerful, gripping tragedy",1134000000,"12 8, 2005",2005,1027,"['pampered', 'daughter', 'police', 'chief', 'Kellie', 'Martin', 'romance', 'attractive', 'polite', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'give', 'wonderful', 'home', 'child', 'beneath', 'perfect', 'surface', 'abuse', 'when', 'Jimmy', 'more', 'violent', 'time', 'Katie', 'future', 'Part', ""'True"", 'Stories', 'Collection', 'Someone', 'Had', 'Known', 'powerful', 'gripping', 'tragedy', 'Keith', 'oversized', 'child', 'unready', 'become', 'father', 'even', 'married', 'Kim', 'who', 'always', 'longed', 'children', 'determined', 'adopt', 'When', 'baby', 'Brittany', 'lives', 'Keith', 'not', 'only', 'carefree', 'ways', 'challenged', 'newfound', 'love', 'new', 'daughter', 'love', 'shaken', 'death', 'wife', 'cancer', 'court', 'system', 'determined', 'take', 'away', 'baby', 'adoption', 'complete', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'gripping', 'believable', 'protagonist', 'young', 'woman', 'determined', 'have', 'child', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'Keith', 'perfect', 'vision', 'young', 'father', 'unprepared', 'challenges', 'parenthood']",If Someone Had Known
891937,A1K4AVQIU704DY,B0007VY54O,"Nancy Sherburne ""a Phil Ochs fan""","[6, 7]","After enjoying watching Kellie Martin on Life Goes On, it was interesting to see her in movies shown on Lifetime. In this one, she is a young wife married to a husband who slowly entangles her in a life of abuse with no end in sight. It was rough seeing how he treated her when she came home from the hospital after giving birth to their child, expecting her to handle the baby and luggage and hitting her when she asked for his help. The movie also helps us understand her wanting to keep it a secret by watching how her father treats his wife, as though she had no intelligence or anything to say that was important enough for him to listen to. Katie saw this as she was growing up, and left her vulnerable to her sadistic husband. In the end, she confronts her father and makes him see how he has been treating his wife, and we hope in the future he begins to change his attitude, and start looking on her as his wife and partner, rather than a dummy. I taped this off Lifetime, and look forward to getting it on DVD now that it has been released on that format. And just to let those reading this know I know not all victims are women, I also enjoyed Men Don't Tell, a movie about a husband dealing with an abusive wife.

891938,A36283XJO4ODGM,B0007VY54O,puff,"[39, 39]","I remember seeing this on tv about 10 years ago. It was well written and Kellie Martin was perfect for the role of the people pleasing young girl.  It was based on a true story of a girl who marries young and winds up being physically and verbally abused by her spouse.  It is a very violent movie. I don't think anyone under 13 should watch it, but it is so realistic.  Abuse can happen to anyone, even a policeman's daughter.  The way to help prevent abuse is to realize that it can happen to anyone and to pay attention to the warning signs.  I think parents should watch this movie with their kids once they start dating. My thanks to Kellie Martin who is so passionate about doing movies that are able to impact lives for the better.  I am glad she is so wise and caring, she really has made a difference in my life.P.S.
