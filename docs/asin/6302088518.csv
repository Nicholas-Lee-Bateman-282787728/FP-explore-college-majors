294464,AHNNSD2R9AL3P,6302088518,Aly-oops!,"[9, 16]","The story of Nicky Cruz is indeed a powerful one & certainly relevant today. Unfortunately, this movie is so outdated that few high school or college students would be able to sit & watch it without laughing outright.The music is horrible (read HORRIBLE). I'm not even convinced that most of secular society would have appreciated it back when this film was made, though I could be wrong on that point. It all seemed to fit so poorly with the movie's premise, & instead of helping the mood of scenes, it actually took much away from what might have been still impactful today.Most of the fight scenes were poorly choreographed & some were reminiscent of ""West Side Story"". I half-expected the gangs to break into a song & dance number at any given moment. Along with that, though I understand the director was attempting to avoid a violent bloodbath on film, this movie could not possibly have accurately depicted ganglife. Most teens & young adults see worse in their own schools. To be fair, I was impressed with Pat Boone's ability to portray a non-judgemental Christian, though there were a few times when the camera angles portrayed him as almost angelic. (David Wilkerson is certainly someone to respect, but let's be realistic.) I am not a fan of Boone, but he handled his role decently enough. It was also pretty neat to see Erik Estrada when he was so young.I'm sorry to say that I regret having purchased this movie. Not b/c the story is bad or even due to a poor script, but simply b/c it is not something I could ever share with the students in my youth group & their friends who would benefit from Cruz's story. Due to my husband's & my own struggle to see beyond the poor quality & dated nature of this film, I have little faith that our students would be able to get much from it.This movie has impacted many, I realize. The story of Nicky Cruz is important, & people today should be exposed to it. Unfortunately, this film won't cut it in secular society today or even in many Christian ones. I hope that one of these days someone will remake this movie in a more realistic way with modern technology, pertinent music, & improved acting. Until then, I'll be referring them to the book & to Cruz's book ""Run, Baby, Run"".",2,Bad Music & Acting Kill This Movie,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,2235,"['story', 'Nicky', 'Cruz', 'indeed', 'powerful', 'one', 'certainly', 'relevant', 'today', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'so', 'outdated', 'few', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'students', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'watch', 'laughing', 'outright.The', 'music', 'horrible', 'read', 'HORRIBLE', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'convinced', 'most', 'secular', 'society', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'back', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'point', 'seemed', 'fit', 'so', 'poorly', 'movie', 'premise', 'instead', 'helping', 'mood', 'scenes', 'actually', 'took', 'much', 'away', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'still', 'impactful', 'today.Most', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'poorly', 'choreographed', 'were', 'reminiscent', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'half-expected', 'gangs', 'break', 'song', 'dance', 'number', 'given', 'moment', 'understand', 'director', 'was', 'attempting', 'avoid', 'violent', 'bloodbath', 'film', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'have', 'accurately', 'depicted', 'ganglife', 'Most', 'teens', 'young', 'adults', 'see', 'worse', 'own', 'schools', 'be', 'fair', 'was', 'impressed', 'Pat', 'Boone', 'ability', 'portray', 'non-judgemental', 'Christian', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'camera', 'portrayed', 'almost', 'angelic', 'David', 'Wilkerson', 'certainly', 'someone', 'respect', 'let', 'be', 'realistic', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Boone', 'handled', 'role', 'decently', 'enough', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'neat', 'see', 'Erik', 'Estrada', 'when', 'was', 'so', 'young.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'regret', 'having', 'purchased', 'movie', 'Not', 'story', 'bad', 'even', 'due', 'poor', 'script', 'simply', 'b/c', 'not', 'something', 'could', 'ever', 'share', 'students', 'youth', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'would', 'benefit', 'Cruz', 'story', 'Due', 'husband', 'own', 'struggle', 'see', 'poor', 'quality', 'dated', 'nature', 'film', 'have', 'little', 'faith', 'students', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'much', 'it.This', 'movie', 'impacted', 'many', 'realize', 'story', 'Nicky', 'Cruz', 'important', 'people', 'today', 'should', 'be', 'exposed', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cut', 'secular', 'society', 'today', 'even', 'many', 'Christian', 'ones', 'hope', 'one', 'days', 'someone', 'will', 'remake', 'movie', 'more', 'realistic', 'way', 'modern', 'technology', 'pertinent', 'music', 'improved', 'acting', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'referring', 'book', 'Cruz', 'book', 'Run', 'Baby', 'Run']",N/A

294474,A6HCMVLET3QNL,6302088518,Ike12stones,"[0, 0]","In tribute to the film; it was an early attempt at a Christian movie dealing with drugs and violence.  I also sympathize with the fact that a film has only so much time to delve into a story that a book has pages and pages to get across.  That said, the movie deviated so far from the actual account given in the book that the story itself was almost unrecognizable.  There were only a few parts where the filmmakers seemed to do some level of justice to an occurrence in the book, and these were often poorly done.For instance: in the book the two major gangs which Wilkerson interacted with WERE the Mau Maus and the Bishops, however, the two gangs had an alliance and were waging war on the police.  In the movie, though, these two gangs were at war.  I understand that the filmmakers were attempting to show the devastation of gang violence, but I think that there were better ways of doing it than completely ignoring the real story.Also, I think it would have been better to have made the film a period piece.  I believe they tried to 'modernize' it (the film came out in 1970), probably so that it would be more relatable to a 1970's audience.  However, Wilkerson's early interactions with the gangs actually took place in the late 50's, early 60's closer to the period of West Side Story; thus some of the slang was changed, and adding certain 'hippie' styles I think really detracted.  The 70's music was also distracting from some of the 'intense' things potentially going on in the film.The overall message was ambiguous, and any real doctrine was lost.  I understand that, particularly in the early 70's (and even today) it would be much tougher to get funding for a Christian film that was 'Pentecostal,' in message (which the book was), but when all is said and done there was left no strong message at all.The casting was good, and I also liked the way that the city 'felt' in the film (sort of), but again it wholly lacked the impact of the book (which is not surprising since the events of the book were changed so drastically).",3,Read the book,1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,2045,"['tribute', 'film', 'was', 'early', 'attempt', 'Christian', 'movie', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'violence', 'also', 'sympathize', 'fact', 'film', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'delve', 'story', 'book', 'pages', 'pages', 'get', 'said', 'movie', 'deviated', 'so', 'far', 'actual', 'account', 'given', 'book', 'story', 'was', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'parts', 'where', 'filmmakers', 'seemed', 'do', 'level', 'justice', 'occurrence', 'book', 'were', 'often', 'poorly', 'done.For', 'instance', 'book', 'two', 'major', 'gangs', 'Wilkerson', 'interacted', 'WERE', 'Mau', 'Maus', 'Bishops', 'however', 'two', 'gangs', 'had', 'alliance', 'were', 'waging', 'war', 'police', 'movie', 'though', 'two', 'gangs', 'were', 'war', 'understand', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'attempting', 'show', 'devastation', 'gang', 'violence', 'think', 'were', 'better', 'ways', 'doing', 'completely', 'ignoring', 'real', 'story.Also', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'period', 'piece', 'believe', 'tried', ""'modernize"", 'film', 'came', 'out', '1970', 'probably', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'relatable', '1970', 'audience', 'However', 'Wilkerson', 'early', 'interactions', 'gangs', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'late', '50', 'early', '60', 'closer', 'period', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'thus', 'slang', 'was', 'changed', 'adding', 'certain', ""'hippie"", 'styles', 'think', 'really', 'detracted', '70', 'music', 'was', 'also', 'distracting', ""'intense"", 'things', 'potentially', 'going', 'film.The', 'overall', 'message', 'was', 'ambiguous', 'real', 'doctrine', 'was', 'lost', 'understand', 'particularly', 'early', '70', 'even', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'tougher', 'get', 'funding', 'Christian', 'film', 'was', ""'Pentecostal"", 'message', 'book', 'was', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'was', 'left', 'strong', 'message', 'all.The', 'casting', 'was', 'good', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'city', ""'felt"", 'film', 'sort', 'again', 'wholly', 'lacked', 'impact', 'book', 'not', 'surprising', 'events', 'book', 'were', 'changed', 'so', 'drastically']",N/A

Often a really good message is spoiled by a poor script and below standard acting.  However, I read the book, The Cross and the Switchblade back in the 60's and it was so inspiring that I've never forgotten it.  I actually went to the area where the action took place a couple of years later when I moved to New York, intending to join the Teen Challenge movement.  I spent a whole day looking for the place, and only learned, a few years later that they had moved to Brooklyn.So, when I saw this on Netflix, I signed up for it.  Again, I didn't expect a lot.  I was never a Pat Boone fan.  So I was very pleasantly surprised at the film.  It's the power of the story that carries you over the sometimes amateurish production.  It was a true story and nothing can change that.  I also found Pat Boone to be very good in the role.  He didn't overact and after a few minutes I forgot who he was and saw him totally as David Wilkerson.  (In the bios, it mentioned that he graduated cum laude from Columbia...who knew?  He got a bad rap from Hollywood, which has never been kind to professing Christians.  I admire him for refusing to sell out for success. )A young Eric Estrada was great as Nicky Cruz and the whole cast seemed to be swept up in the spirit of the film.  It wasn't as moving as the book, but not very many films are.There were some interesting features, most notably a filmed sermon by Nicky Cruz in South Africa.  He is really an impressive person.Non Christians probably won't go for the film (see the one star review) but others, who connect to the central story, should be able to overcome the fact that it is dated, and low budget, and find it an inspiring experience.",4,Low Budget film with a Great Message,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,1814,"['usually', 'stay', 'away', 'religious', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'match', 'production', 'values', 'commercial', 'films', 'Often', 'really', 'good', 'message', 'spoiled', 'poor', 'script', 'standard', 'acting', 'However', 'read', 'book', 'Cross', 'Switchblade', 'back', '60', 'was', 'so', 'inspiring', ""'ve"", 'never', 'forgotten', 'actually', 'went', 'area', 'where', 'action', 'took', 'place', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'intending', 'join', 'Teen', 'Challenge', 'movement', 'spent', 'whole', 'day', 'looking', 'place', 'only', 'learned', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'had', 'moved', 'Brooklyn.So', 'when', 'saw', 'Netflix', 'signed', 'up', 'Again', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'was', 'never', 'Pat', 'Boone', 'fan', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'power', 'story', 'sometimes', 'amateurish', 'production', 'was', 'true', 'story', 'nothing', 'can', 'change', 'also', 'found', 'Pat', 'Boone', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'overact', 'few', 'minutes', 'forgot', 'who', 'was', 'saw', 'totally', 'David', 'Wilkerson', 'bios', 'mentioned', 'graduated', 'cum', 'laude', 'Columbia', 'who', 'knew', 'got', 'bad', 'rap', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'been', 'kind', 'professing', 'Christians', 'admire', 'refusing', 'sell', 'out', 'success', 'young', 'Eric', 'Estrada', 'was', 'great', 'Nicky', 'Cruz', 'whole', 'cast', 'seemed', 'be', 'swept', 'up', 'spirit', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'moving', 'book', 'not', 'very', 'many', 'films', 'were', 'interesting', 'features', 'most', 'notably', 'filmed', 'sermon', 'Nicky', 'Cruz', 'South', 'Africa', 'really', 'impressive', 'person.Non', 'Christians', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'film', 'see', 'one', 'star', 'review', 'others', 'who', 'connect', 'central', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'overcome', 'fact', 'dated', 'low', 'budget', 'find', 'inspiring', 'experience']",N/A
