953229,A1G9FX1KV45N41,B000BYRCC4,Gary Selikow,"[0, 0]","This is fascinating and most educational documentary about the terrible night on 29 December 1940 in which the Nazis carried out a sustained bombing attack against London, targeting and almost destroying St Paul's Cathedral (which had burned down twice in its twenty year history) and scorching a mile of the city.Through a series of interviews, real footage and dramatic recreations, we get an idea of the terror, devastation and sacrifices which the ordinary people of London went through. And this is  what makes this an incredibly pivotal documentary for anyone with an interest in these events, Should be shown is all schools when studying this period.Nazi Germany aimed to break the will of the British people but as a citizen of London who lived through the blitz tells us they underestimated the will and valour of the British people. The vicious incendiary bombing of London only strengthened their determination to fight on and their hatred of the Nazi evil. some really poignant and heartbreaking parts.A lot of young British people are not aware of the devastation caused by the blitz which makes this a truly important documentary. The British people may need to once again prove their metal, in an age of global terrorism and jihad. The one modern parallel I can think of is the sustained wave of terror weathered with valour by the people of Israel in the first decade of the 21st century.",5,Fascinating and  educational,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,1404,"['fascinating', 'most', 'educational', 'documentary', 'terrible', 'night', '29', 'December', '1940', 'Nazis', 'carried', 'out', 'sustained', 'bombing', 'attack', 'London', 'targeting', 'almost', 'destroying', 'St', 'Paul', 'Cathedral', 'had', 'burned', 'down', 'twice', 'twenty', 'year', 'history', 'scorching', 'mile', 'city.Through', 'series', 'interviews', 'real', 'footage', 'dramatic', 'recreations', 'get', 'idea', 'terror', 'devastation', 'sacrifices', 'ordinary', 'people', 'London', 'went', 'what', 'incredibly', 'pivotal', 'documentary', 'anyone', 'interest', 'events', 'Should', 'be', 'shown', 'schools', 'when', 'studying', 'period.Nazi', 'Germany', 'aimed', 'break', 'will', 'British', 'people', 'citizen', 'London', 'who', 'lived', 'blitz', 'underestimated', 'will', 'valour', 'British', 'people', 'vicious', 'incendiary', 'bombing', 'London', 'only', 'strengthened', 'determination', 'fight', 'hatred', 'Nazi', 'evil', 'really', 'poignant', 'heartbreaking', 'parts.A', 'lot', 'young', 'British', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'aware', 'devastation', 'caused', 'blitz', 'truly', 'important', 'documentary', 'British', 'people', 'may', 'need', 'once', 'again', 'prove', 'metal', 'age', 'global', 'terrorism', 'jihad', 'one', 'modern', 'parallel', 'can', 'think', 'sustained', 'wave', 'terror', 'weathered', 'valour', 'people', 'Israel', 'first', 'decade', '21st', 'century']",The Blitz: London's Longest Night

This story of the the Blitz was more informative, personal & enlightening than anything I have seen or read. My one brief visit to London did not do this city justice & I never realized how much damage was done to the center of the city in the square mile surrounding St. Paul's Cathedral, indeed the symbol of London. I had never heard the details of the heroic efforts employed to save it that night. First, fire bombs to light the way for the heavy bombers, then the fire storms & the target of all that was still standing. Then the Germans blinked. They recalled another wave of bombers that surely would have destroyed London. The moment passed & they were never quite able to maintain the advantage they had December 29, 1940. The blending of actual documentary footage & recreations made for 90 minutes of compelling viewing. Survivors & participants of that night were interviewed. Many of them are very old but their memories are fresh. It is obvious from the emotions on their faces recalling that night that this was a life altering experience. One you never forget.

953231,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B000BYRCC4,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[30, 32]","The PBS documetary, ""The Blitz London's Longest Night"" is a fascinating look at both the facts and feelings, that surrounded the night of December 29, 1940, when Hitler's bombers lead an unprecedented ariel attack apon the city of London. The ferocious fires, that the attack started, nearly burned a whole square mile of London to the ground. The main target of the attack seems to have been, St. Paul's Cathedral, which was both an iconic part of the London skyline and also an important symbol of English history. The intent was to have been to try and scare the British people into overnight submission and break their will. Luckily, history did not play out that way. Instead of being bombed into submission 'the Blitz' united the British people into a common cause. The documentary is aptly named, because it really does seem to be ""London's Longest Night"". The film takes us on an hour by hour progression of what happened. It shows us every step of the bombing and the response of both the British firemen and ordinary London citizens alike to extordinary events. The documentary shows us this, through a mixture of narration, actual archival footage, interviews with elderly witnesses and dramatizations of their stories. These elements are seemlessly weaved together to tell an interesting and emotionally arresting tale. The dramatizations are very well done and most effective. Among these stories we meet a family in a bomb shelter, a man accompanied by his wife trying to return to his rescue unit, two foreign reporters getting the story, a number of firemen working to contain the fires and a priest and his cohorts trying to protect St.Paul's from burning down. The story of St. Paul's Cathedral is most important, because it really is the emotional backbone (or spine) of the film. It's a symbol of England's survival, in that dark night of history. By the end of the film, we are shown a juxaposition between a fire bombed London, just after the attack and the new modern city, that has risen out of the fiery rubble & ashes like a Pheonix. This is an excellent documentary, that is not only factual, but is quite moving and will leave you on the edge of your seat.

953232,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000BYRCC4,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","""The Blitz: London's Longest Night"" is an excellent documentary about the horrific Nazi bombing of London on the night of December 29, 1940. Hitler wanted to break the will of the Londoners so he could claim another city and eventually all of Great Britain. The film held my attention every step of the way; it interweaves convincing reenactments of the events of that night with interviews from survivors and there is appalling, memorable film footage taken that night from the top of St. Pauls' Cathedral.The reenactments include the story of 2 American press reporters who want the story of the air raid so Americans would know just how bad the Nazi bombings really were; they were hoping a true telling of the story would convince Americans to enter the war. There is also the retelling of what happened to a family and others when a bomb hit their shelter and we see how a British couple (like many others) had the pain of leaving their daughter behind in the countryside, safe away from London. In this case, the man with his wife could bravely try to rejoin his rescue unit during that awful night. We get stories of firefighters trying so hard to contain fires which were practically out of control and we see just how desperate people were to preserve St. Paul's Cathedral.We learn that while the Nazis were surely interested in bombing London to raze it to the ground; their number one target that particular night was St. Paul's Cathedral. St. Paul's was and remains a strong iconic symbol of British history and resolve which is why Hitler was intent on destroying it by the air raid that night. True, Hitler did demolish quite a bit of London; but we learn what happened to St. Paul's in this gripping documentary. I was never once bored for a minute.In addition, we see how the people of London were not bombed into submission; quite the opposite occurred. Londoners became more resolute than ever to fight Hitler and win the war.Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't come with any extras; this is a minor quibble, however, since the quality of the documentary is absolutely superb. The entire film, right up to its very emotional ending, couldn't have been made any better.I recommend this film for anyone studying World War Two; people who appreciate historical and/or military documentary films will not be disappointed.",5,"gripping, unforgettable and very well done",1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,2330,"['Blitz', 'London', 'Longest', 'Night', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'horrific', 'Nazi', 'bombing', 'London', 'night', 'December', '29', '1940', 'Hitler', 'wanted', 'break', 'will', 'Londoners', 'could', 'claim', 'city', 'eventually', 'Great', 'Britain', 'film', 'held', 'attention', 'step', 'way', 'convincing', 'reenactments', 'events', 'night', 'interviews', 'survivors', 'appalling', 'memorable', 'film', 'footage', 'taken', 'night', 'top', 'St.', 'Pauls', 'Cathedral.The', 'reenactments', 'include', 'story', '2', 'American', 'press', 'reporters', 'who', 'want', 'story', 'air', 'raid', 'so', 'Americans', 'would', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'Nazi', 'bombings', 'really', 'were', 'were', 'hoping', 'true', 'telling', 'story', 'would', 'convince', 'Americans', 'enter', 'war', 'also', 'retelling', 'what', 'happened', 'family', 'others', 'when', 'bomb', 'hit', 'shelter', 'see', 'how', 'British', 'couple', 'many', 'others', 'had', 'pain', 'leaving', 'daughter', 'countryside', 'safe', 'away', 'London', 'case', 'man', 'wife', 'could', 'bravely', 'try', 'rejoin', 'rescue', 'unit', 'awful', 'night', 'get', 'stories', 'firefighters', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'contain', 'fires', 'were', 'practically', 'control', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'desperate', 'people', 'were', 'preserve', 'St.', 'Paul', 'Cathedral.We', 'learn', 'Nazis', 'were', 'surely', 'interested', 'bombing', 'London', 'raze', 'ground', 'number', 'one', 'target', 'particular', 'night', 'was', 'St.', 'Paul', 'Cathedral', 'St.', 'Paul', 'was', 'strong', 'iconic', 'symbol', 'British', 'history', 'resolve', 'why', 'Hitler', 'was', 'intent', 'destroying', 'air', 'raid', 'night', 'True', 'Hitler', 'did', 'demolish', 'quite', 'bit', 'London', 'learn', 'what', 'happened', 'St.', 'Paul', 'gripping', 'documentary', 'was', 'never', 'once', 'bored', 'minute.In', 'addition', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'London', 'were', 'not', 'bombed', 'submission', 'opposite', 'occurred', 'Londoners', 'became', 'more', 'resolute', 'ever', 'fight', 'Hitler', 'win', 'war.Unfortunately', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'come', 'extras', 'minor', 'quibble', 'however', 'quality', 'documentary', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'entire', 'film', 'right', 'up', 'very', 'emotional', 'ending', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'made', 'better.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'studying', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'historical', 'and/or', 'military', 'documentary', 'films', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",The Blitz: London's Longest Night
