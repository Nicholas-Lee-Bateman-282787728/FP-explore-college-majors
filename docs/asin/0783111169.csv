Mackowiak ""gelalema""","[16, 17]","For those of us who were young people in 1950, this story about a family in California is very authentic in almost every detail.  Jane Wyatt is perfect as the mother struggling with the pros and cons of revealing that her eldest daughter Gail is adopted, a rare situation in 1950 America.  When the middle daughter finds out and reveals the adoption to her step-sister out of spite, a chain of events are unleashed that could have been disasterous were it not for the strong bond and love and devotion the parents inculcated in all three daughters.  In the end, this movie demonstrates that adopted children thrive when the adopted parents consider the child 'their very own.'  Superb movie in every respect and should be required viewing for adopted children and those considering being adoptive parents.",5,Excellent movie about adoption and its problems,1069286400,"11 20, 2003",2003,805,"['who', 'were', 'young', 'people', '1950', 'story', 'family', 'California', 'very', 'authentic', 'almost', 'detail', 'Jane', 'Wyatt', 'perfect', 'mother', 'struggling', 'pros', 'cons', 'revealing', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Gail', 'adopted', 'rare', 'situation', '1950', 'America', 'When', 'middle', 'daughter', 'out', 'reveals', 'adoption', 'step-sister', 'spite', 'chain', 'events', 'are', 'unleashed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'disasterous', 'were', 'not', 'strong', 'bond', 'love', 'devotion', 'parents', 'inculcated', 'three', 'daughters', 'end', 'movie', 'adopted', 'children', 'thrive', 'when', 'adopted', 'parents', 'consider', 'child', 'very', 'own', 'Superb', 'movie', 'respect', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'adopted', 'children', 'considering', 'being', 'adoptive', 'parents']",N/A

For myself (and obviously quite a few others), however, I find it a wonderful portrait of pre-60's American family life.  The cast is excellent and the story, while a bit sentimental, adds an extra layer of emotion and drama to what was seen on the family-oriented television shows such as ""Father Knows Best"" that became popular in the 1950's.

42480,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,0783111169,Only-A-Child,"[6, 9]","""Our Very Own"" (1950) is one of those films appreciated today for entirely different reasons than at the time of its release.  Most 21st century viewers will enjoy the film for its time capsule look at life in 1949 Middle America. Particularly entertaining is a relatively long opening sequence about the delivery and installation of the family's first television set. Younger viewers should note that most American households did not acquire one of these devices until the mid-1950's, so a 1950 audience would have found the sequence almost as novel and interesting as we find it today.This opening sequence includes a great routine between nine year old Penny (Natalie Wood) and Frank (Gus Schilling) the TV repairman. Precocious Natalie manages to hijack the film at this early stage and leave the viewer wishing she had more screen time. It is so entertaining (and so 1950) that the rather routine events making up the remainder of the film are a considerable letdown.The Macaulay family has three sisters, 18-year-old Gail (Ann Blyth), 16-year-old Joan (Joan Evans), and nine year old Penny (Wood). The three actresses look enough alike to be actual sisters but it turns out their parents have an ugly secret; Gail was adopted as an infant. Gail is writing a speech for her upcoming high school graduation and thinking about college when she is not busy keeping Joan from flirting with her steady boyfriend (an aging television installer) named Chuck (Farley Granger). Joan is followed around by a depressed looking Martin Milner; the king of the ""numerical"" television series (""Route 66"" and ""Adam 12""). On Gail's eighteenth birthday, Joan accidentally discovers her parent's great adoption secret. During an argument with Gail she blurts out this new information and Gail goes into state of shock and anguish for the remainder of the film. It turns out that Gail's biological father was killed in an accident before she was born, but her mother is alive. A meeting is arranged but it goes bad.This is the film's other great scene as the two Anns (Ann Dvorack plays the biological mother) play off each other quite well. Although there is a certain socioeconomic prejudice showcased, it is nonetheless staged extremely well and is quite original. Dvorack must nervously pretend before to her husband and their guests that Gail is the daughter of an old friend.Subsequent to this mother-daughter meeting comes another rather simplistic development as the father of Gail's best friend decides to skip his daughter's graduation ceremony. Thus does Gail come to appreciate the true meaning of ""family"".Overall ""Our Very Own"" is full of solid performances but Blyth is clearly the star. She was not an actress with much emotional range and tended to specialize in women who were morose when they were not being serious. She handles the scenes of Gail's shock and depression quite well but doesn't really convey the happy pre-revelation Gail. In fact, I don't recall Blyth ever playing convincingly happy in any of her films-not even in a Snow White's Evil Queen sort of way.Then again, what do I know?

She's beautiful, she has a loving family, a faithful boyfriend (Farley Granger), and is about to graduate from high school. She has her fair share of problems, like her ambitious little sister Joan (Joan Evans) who tries to horn in on her boyfriend. However, their mother (Jane Wyatt) seems to keep her in line pretty well, that is until Joan learns a family secret and blurts it out to Gail in an arguement. Gail was adopted. The news turns her life upside down and has her questioning her perfect life and pushing the people that love her away.An interesting and unusual story, Our Very Own features all of the corniness of family dramas but with an edge. Unlike many films of the era, the story focuses mainly on a teenaged girl. There are scenes at school, a big birthday party that combines family and teenage romance, and a lovely date on the beach. Also telling of the times is the opener where the family gathers excitedly around their new tv set. The acting is supurb on all sides, and no wonder with such an all star cast.
