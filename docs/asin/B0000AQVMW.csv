He also finds himself constantly daydreaming about his attractive young secretary.Unlike Al Bundy of ""Married With Children"", though, Reggy does not plan to suffer in silence. Instead, he plans and executes an escape. He fakes his own death and assumes that his new life will be full of fun and adventure. However, with no references since he essentially has no past after his ""resurrection"", he finds he can only get a job as an assistant to a pig farmer. Also, he finds himself missing and drawn back to his wife/widow.The comedy is quite British. If you don't appreciate that kind of humor you won't like this series, but it seems quite relevant even though it was made over 30 years ago. It pokes fun at what and who society finds valuable and why, and the scenes of Reggy talking things over at night with his cat are hilarious.There is one big difference between Al Bundy and John Cleese's Mr. Fawlty though - Reggy Perrin really does love his wife and she loves him. Their tenderness and fondness for one another shines through regardless of what else happens. I haven't seen this show aired in America for about 25 years, and then it was only shown on PBS as far as I know. It will be great to have it in a form where I can see the whole series over a short time frame rather than just one episode every Sunday night. Recommended for all who have dreamed of something better for themselves, find society to be at times - or always - ridiculous, and love British comedy.",5,Al Bundy doesn't have anything on Reginald Perrin,1241913600,"05 10, 2009",2009,1695,"['Reginald', 'Perrin', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'bland', 'job', 'who', 'bland', 'existence', 'boss', 'who', 'slogans', 'marriage', 'seemed', 'have', 'lost', 'spark', 'grown', 'daughter', 'husband', 'unbearable', 'company', 'also', 'constantly', 'daydreaming', 'attractive', 'young', 'secretary.Unlike', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'Married', 'Children', 'Reggy', 'not', 'plan', 'suffer', 'silence', 'Instead', 'escape', 'own', 'death', 'new', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'full', 'fun', 'adventure', 'However', 'references', 'essentially', 'past', 'resurrection', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'job', 'assistant', 'pig', 'farmer', 'Also', 'missing', 'drawn', 'back', 'wife/widow.The', 'comedy', 'quite', 'British', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'kind', 'humor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'series', 'quite', 'relevant', 'even', 'was', 'made', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'fun', 'what', 'who', 'society', 'finds', 'valuable', 'why', 'scenes', 'Reggy', 'talking', 'things', 'night', 'cat', 'are', 'hilarious.There', 'one', 'big', 'difference', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Mr.', 'Fawlty', 'Reggy', 'Perrin', 'really', 'love', 'wife', 'tenderness', 'fondness', 'one', 'shines', 'regardless', 'what', 'else', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'aired', 'America', 'about', '25', 'years', 'then', 'was', 'only', 'shown', 'PBS', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'have', 'form', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'whole', 'series', 'short', 'time', 'frame', 'rather', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'Sunday', 'night', 'Recommended', 'who', 'have', 'dreamed', 'something', 'better', 'find', 'society', 'be', 'times', 'always', 'ridiculous', 'love', 'British', 'comedy']",The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin: The Complete Collection

David Warwick is nothing short of brilliant, with his smirky exasperation and sardonic commentary (both out loud and within his own mind) with regards to his circumstances and the people around him. But don't allow the latter to give you the impression that this is just another sharp-edged satire. The characters are all very likable, despite their lunacy, and Reginald Perrin himself, in the end, has an indomitable spirit. The title of the program says it all. The supporting cast - a bizarre variety of eccentrics -  is also superb. Rise and Fall is at least on par with Monty Python and other great British comedy (or any comedy, for that matter).

767739,A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B0000AQVMW,M. Hill,"[3, 3]","Odds are if you are reaading this review, you are a fan of the series. Over the years I've thought about these episodes and how smart they are more times than I can count. I was moved by the show's ""truths"" decades ago and my only concern, as with other older pieces, was if in viewing it today, it might be dated. Did its biting wit survive the years? Absolutely. If you are considering buying this set, do it, you won't be disappointed. It was like welcoming an old friend back home.The workplace is often so disheartening and dehumanizing -- which is perfectly portrayed in this series. Capitalizing on the absurdity of life by breaking free from the corporate world and creating the GROT shops which sell nothing of any use to anyone, is so smart and life-affirming. The sameness of the corporate world, the usual set of characters, like the pompous ignorant boss, the yes-men, etc., and the numerous ways in which employees, on a daily basis, are humiliated and have the life sucked out of them, is dead-on accurate. But, what really sets this series apart is the title character's attempt to break from the lemmings. Watching his success, and happiness at his independence is joyful, yet temporary. Eventually, as the GROT shops expand in number and popularity, he realizes he has created the same corporate environment he was attempting to escape. It is the realization that no matter how unique an idea and its execution, once the business reaches a certain size it morphs into the corporate model. But he refuses to give up. He is determined to keep shaking things up -- a human spirit at its best. This is an individual who, in mid-life, decides to have a re-birth, and reinvent himself in order to live a happy meaningful life. This is simply a brilliant series.I ordered a used set listed on this page but was sent the earlier Region 2 version without the extras. I note this because I cannot speak to that part of the package. I don't like edited movies and I certainly don't want an ignorantly censored US version of a very special British TV comedy. Am I happy?  I am delighted even though I can only play this set through my laptop.

I'm doing one anyway, based on the television series and NOT the quality of the DVD set (which at this point is unknown).  However, we can make some good guesses here and guesses which are at least valuable in deciding whether or not you'll be interested in this.First of all, this is as English a series as it comes.  Absolutely no attempt is made to ""Americanize"" it, so if you have trouble understanding English accents (and even *I* do at times) or dislike the English sense of humor then stay well aware from this.Otherwise, this is a *superb* show, equally on par with Fawlty Towers as one of the best the English has to offer. It's sharp satire but not ""crazy"" in the Monty Python sense.  Reginald is a man who gets fed up with the middle class rut he's living in, and fakes his own death to get away from it all -- except he can't get away from it all and no matter how he tries to fail he keeps succeeding even more.  It stars the late Leonard Rossiter who is absolutely brilliant in this -- actually, the entire cast is superb.The show is a hidden treasure -- here in the States there were two VHS tapes released fifteen years ago which covered only the first half of the series (the ""fall"" of Reginald).  Then you could buy a PAL set of this (assuming you had the ability to play it) but that's gone out of stock as well.  This NTSC DVD set looks to be the entire show and worth every penny.

In a sense it is a novel (the story of an individual and how that individual's character is revealed and shaped by his struggles against the world), kind of like Fielding's ""Tom Jones"".  There is the individual gag (a la Monty Python, Faulty Towers, etc.) but these individual scenes also knit together wonderfully to slowly build up long-term plotlines and over-arching themes that roll along like an ever-faster juggernaut.And it is funny, so help me God it is.  Set aside any language and cultural concerns you may have, along with any dislike of subtle subtextual wit aside; this is hurt-your-gut hilarious humor.It is ""The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit"" playing musical chairs with Kafka's ""Joseph K"" and Carrol's ""Alice"" at the Mad Hatter's tea party.

At the time, it was hysterically funny, but nothing more than that to a young man who couldn't imagine growing older. Some 30+ years later, it's just as funny, but its satiric sting hits a lot more closely to home!Reginald Perrin is an Everyman, working at a mid-level Everyjob, with a loving but complacent wife, living an decent but ordinary life. Except that he's reached the point where he's begun to wonder, &#34;Is this all there is? Did I work so hard just for this?&#34;  He's clearly headed for a breakdown ... and we watch it unfold in all its absurdity & underlying despair, episode by episode. Poor Reggie is smart enough to realize how utterly banal & meaningless his life has become; but while he can't simply give in to it, he doesn't know how to break out of it, either. Which means he slowly, inexorably begins to crumble from within.When he does break out, it's with manic intensity, following a crazy scheme that seems quite logical & sensible to him. But can he really escape that life & leave it behind? The answer to that question is ironic & ruefully funny, but it's not that far removed from &#34;No Exit.&#34;I don't want to make it all sound too heavy, though! Before all else, this is a comedy, and it certainly delivers the laughs. But as with all good comedy, there's more to it -- the repeated catchphrases are not only good jokes, but they reinforce the endless repetition that is Reggie's day-to-day life. Always the same jokes, always the same people, playing out their familiar roles without variation ... you'll laugh, but you'll also recognize its essential & harsh truth.The essence of the series is in its first season. As previous reviewers have mentioned, there is a bit of falling off in the subsequent seasons, although they aren't without a fair share of humor as well. But that first season alone makes the entire set worth 5 stars, and well worth buying -- highly recommended!",5,Both hilarious & surprisingly dark,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,2000,"['remember', 'seeing', 'show', '20s', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'America', 'time', 'was', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'nothing', 'more', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'growing', 'older', '30+', 'years', 'later', 'just', 'funny', 'satiric', 'sting', 'lot', 'more', 'closely', 'home', 'Reginald', 'Perrin', 'Everyman', 'working', 'mid-level', 'Everyjob', 'loving', 'complacent', 'wife', 'living', 'decent', 'ordinary', 'life', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'begun', 'wonder', '34', 'Did', 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'just', '34', 'clearly', 'headed', 'breakdown', 'watch', 'unfold', 'absurdity', 'underlying', 'despair', 'episode', 'episode', 'Poor', 'Reggie', 'smart', 'enough', 'realize', 'how', 'utterly', 'banal', 'meaningless', 'life', 'become', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'give', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'break', 'either', 'Which', 'slowly', 'inexorably', 'crumble', 'within.When', 'break', 'out', 'manic', 'intensity', 'following', 'crazy', 'scheme', 'quite', 'logical', 'sensible', 'can', 'really', 'escape', 'life', 'leave', 'answer', 'question', 'ironic', 'ruefully', 'funny', 'not', 'far', 'removed', '34', 'No', 'Exit.', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'sound', 'too', 'heavy', 'though', 'else', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'laughs', 'good', 'comedy', 'more', 'repeated', 'catchphrases', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'jokes', 'reinforce', 'endless', 'repetition', 'Reggie', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'same', 'jokes', 'always', 'same', 'people', 'playing', 'out', 'familiar', 'roles', 'variation', ""'ll"", 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'also', 'recognize', 'essential', 'harsh', 'truth.The', 'essence', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'bit', 'falling', 'off', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'are', ""n't"", 'fair', 'share', 'humor', 'well', 'first', 'season', 'alone', 'entire', 'set', 'worth', '5', 'stars', 'well', 'worth', 'buying', 'highly', 'recommended']",The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin: The Complete Collection
