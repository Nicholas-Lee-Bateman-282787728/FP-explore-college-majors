1130298,A67E13E1BSNBN,B00116GEK2,B. Brierly,"[4, 4]","""Sea Change"" is one of four stories by Robert B. Parker's Jesse Stone.  Tom Selleck is perfect for the part of Jesse Stone.  He is hired as Chief of Police in the town of Paradise as soneone the city council can lead around by the nose.  However, he proves himself to be not only an honest cop but is also superb at his job.  He is relentless when he goes after the ""bad guys"".  ""Sea Change"" no exception.  The story is riveting and at times keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Paradise is Jesse's last chance as his problem with alcohol caused him to be fired from his promising career as a detective in Las Angeles.  His struggles in ""Sea Change"" continue even to the point where he could lose his life if he gets to lost in the booze.  Robert B. Parker wrote dozens on stories about Jesse Stone and Tom Selleck has said in interviews that he would like to do them all.  Fans, including me, would like to see him do them all.  When you watch one episode you are hungry for anoter.  I hope that ""Sea Change"" isn't the last of the series filmed.  Tom Selleck has a part on a regular TV series and is surely busy but I hope he can take time to do another Jesse Stone soon.  ""Sea Change"" answered many questions but opened up new ones and Jesse Stone is still suffering with his alcohol problem.  I highly recommend ""Sea Change"" as well as the three preceeding stories; ""Night Passage"", ""Cold Stone"", and ""Death in Paradise"".  If you don't watch these movies you are really missing some fantastic stories and terrific acting.

1130299,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00116GEK2,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[29, 30]","""Jesse Stone: Sea Change"", the fourth TV adaptation of Robert B. Parker's novels of the alcoholic police chief of a tiny coastal town, again offers a terrific little character study/mystery, benefiting enormously from Tom Selleck's grizzled charm and integrity in the lead.Things are slow in Paradise, and with Stone's ex asking him to quit calling (as she is ""seeing someone""), he finds himself sliding back to the bottle, alarming his friends and the City Council. Deciding to reopen an unsolved murder case from a dozen years earlier, to pass the time, his experience as an ex-L.A. cop soon offers clues that the case was mismanaged, and was far more than a simple bank hostage shooting. Then a father drags his pretty daughter in, claiming she had been raped by a contestant in the upcoming regatta, a charge that Stone is suspicious of, as the girl's behavior indicates a far different scenario. The two cases form the crux of a very interesting few days in Stone's life!As always, the story is character-driven, with 'regulars' William Devane, Stephen McHattie, Kohl Sudduth, Vito Rezza, and Viola Davis joined by the always enjoyable Kathy Baker, assuming Davis' police job as she has a baby. With Saul Rubinek reprising his role as the money-laundering banker who hired Stone to be chief, the world-weary cop must also deal with a 'bad girl' (Sean Young, who STILL looks hot in a bikini), a 'good girl' with a secret (Rebecca Pidgeon), a crusty ex-bank guard (James Gammon), and an arrogant mobster (William Sadler), and his 'hitman' (James Rogers). And we mustn't forget Joe the Dog as Reggie, mute but reproving witness of Stone's nightly alcoholic 'fix'.For audiences weaned on action-oriented 'Shoot-'em-Ups', the story may seem slow, but if you prefer your stories deeper than bullet counts, with well-etched characters, and Selleck's undeniable charm, the latest ""Stone"" film will be 100 minutes, well-spent!",4,"Selleck Scores Again, in Latest 'Stone' Film!",1204848000,"03 7, 2008",2008,1922,"['Jesse', 'Stone', 'Sea', 'Change', 'fourth', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'Robert', 'B.', 'Parker', 'novels', 'alcoholic', 'police', 'chief', 'tiny', 'coastal', 'town', 'again', 'terrific', 'little', 'character', 'study/mystery', 'benefiting', 'enormously', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'grizzled', 'charm', 'integrity', 'lead.Things', 'are', 'slow', 'Paradise', 'Stone', 'ex', 'asking', 'quit', 'calling', 'seeing', 'someone', 'sliding', 'back', 'bottle', 'alarming', 'friends', 'City', 'Council', 'Deciding', 'reopen', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'case', 'dozen', 'years', 'earlier', 'pass', 'time', 'experience', 'ex-L.A.', 'cop', 'soon', 'clues', 'case', 'was', 'mismanaged', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'simple', 'bank', 'hostage', 'shooting', 'Then', 'father', 'pretty', 'daughter', 'claiming', 'had', 'been', 'raped', 'contestant', 'upcoming', 'regatta', 'charge', 'Stone', 'suspicious', 'girl', 'behavior', 'far', 'different', 'scenario', 'two', 'cases', 'form', 'crux', 'very', 'interesting', 'few', 'days', 'Stone', 'life', 'always', 'story', 'character-driven', ""'regulars"", 'William', 'Devane', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', 'Kohl', 'Sudduth', 'Vito', 'Rezza', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'joined', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'assuming', 'Davis', 'police', 'job', 'baby', 'Saul', 'Rubinek', 'reprising', 'role', 'money-laundering', 'banker', 'who', 'hired', 'Stone', 'be', 'chief', 'world-weary', 'cop', 'must', 'also', 'deal', ""'bad"", 'girl', 'Sean', 'Young', 'who', 'STILL', 'hot', 'bikini', ""'good"", 'girl', 'secret', 'Rebecca', 'Pidgeon', 'crusty', 'ex-bank', 'guard', 'James', 'Gammon', 'arrogant', 'mobster', 'William', 'Sadler', ""'hitman"", 'James', 'Rogers', 'must', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Joe', 'Dog', 'Reggie', 'mute', 'reproving', 'witness', 'Stone', 'nightly', 'alcoholic', 'audiences', 'weaned', 'action-oriented', ""'Shoot-'em-Ups"", 'story', 'may', 'seem', 'slow', 'prefer', 'stories', 'deeper', 'bullet', 'counts', 'well-etched', 'characters', 'Selleck', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'latest', 'Stone', 'film', 'will', 'be', '100', 'minutes', 'well-spent']",Jesse Stone: Sea Change

Thurlow,"[1, 1]","""Sea Change"", the fourth of the Jesse Stone television movies, is one of the better productions, with a strong cast, two interesting mysteries, and of course Tom Selleck in a role perfectly suited to his mature acting talents.As the story opens, Jesse Stone, police chief of the small New England seaport town of Paradise, is hitting the bottle rather harder than usual.  His psychiatrist Dr. Dix (a grizzled and pitch-perfect William Devane) suggests he find some work to do.  Jesse reopens an unsolved bank robbery and homicide, inadvertantly reopening old wounds inside and outside Paradise, and placing himself and others in danger.  Just to keep it interesting, an unwelcome rape case also drops into his lap, one that assistant Rose Gammon (Kathy Baker) insists that he solve.Like the other Jesse Stone movies, ""Sea Change"" is populated by familiar faces from the earlier movies, along with some newcomers, including veteran actors Rebecca Pidgeon, Sean Young, and Nigel Bennett.  The pacing is slow, deliberate, and meditative, as Stone metes out his own brand of justice in both cases.

In this series a more mature but still incredibly handsome Tom Selleck plays the character of the Chief of Police of a small New England town called Paradise, Massachusetts.Jesse Stone is a former Los Angeles homicide detective who left life in the big city and is now underemployed, but still doing service to the community, which he loves. He is divorced from the ""only woman he is able to love"" but still talks to her each and every night, and is now seeing a psychiatrist who is helping him with his issues to attempt to stop his addiction to alcohol. At some point the shrink makes Jesse realize that he is able to avoid drinking only when a case is serious and has him totally involved in finding a solution, so he goes out of his way to find cases and tries to resolve an old murder that took place a few years back.Life in Paradise is slow and for the most part the Chief of Police only gives out traffic or parking tickets. In this episode a local girl accuses a yachtsman of rape, a man who is visiting town during Racing Week which is rather important to the local economy.The old robbery - murder case becomes rather interesting as we see the detective work uncovering details that finally solve the mystery. While the case is being solved, we have the opportunity to witness great photography and the scenes by the sea are simply magnificent. As with all DVD's, our favorite part is the opportunity to watch the special features and we saw the interview with Tom Selleck where we learned that he was involved in the production of this film.Don't miss it, the pace is slow but introspective, the plot is deep and intelligent, and you are left with feeling admiration for a man that has done wrong things while always attempting to do what is right!",5,Tom Selleck at his best...,1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,1933,"['second', 'series', 'recently', 'acquired', 'Death', 'Paradise', 'great', 'find', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'own', 'entire', 'Magnum', 'PI', 'collection', 'series', 'more', 'mature', 'still', 'incredibly', 'handsome', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'character', 'Chief', 'Police', 'small', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'called', 'Paradise', 'Massachusetts.Jesse', 'Stone', 'former', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'homicide', 'detective', 'who', 'left', 'life', 'big', 'city', 'now', 'underemployed', 'still', 'doing', 'service', 'community', 'divorced', 'only', 'woman', 'able', 'love', 'still', 'talks', 'night', 'now', 'seeing', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'helping', 'issues', 'attempt', 'stop', 'addiction', 'alcohol', 'point', 'shrink', 'Jesse', 'realize', 'able', 'avoid', 'drinking', 'only', 'when', 'case', 'serious', 'totally', 'involved', 'finding', 'solution', 'way', 'find', 'cases', 'tries', 'resolve', 'old', 'murder', 'took', 'place', 'few', 'years', 'back.Life', 'Paradise', 'slow', 'most', 'part', 'Chief', 'Police', 'only', 'out', 'traffic', 'parking', 'tickets', 'episode', 'local', 'girl', 'yachtsman', 'rape', 'man', 'who', 'visiting', 'town', 'Racing', 'Week', 'rather', 'important', 'local', 'economy.The', 'old', 'robbery', 'murder', 'case', 'rather', 'interesting', 'see', 'detective', 'work', 'uncovering', 'details', 'finally', 'solve', 'mystery', 'case', 'being', 'solved', 'have', 'opportunity', 'witness', 'great', 'photography', 'scenes', 'sea', 'are', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'DVD', 'favorite', 'part', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'special', 'features', 'saw', 'interview', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'where', 'learned', 'was', 'involved', 'production', 'film.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'pace', 'slow', 'introspective', 'plot', 'deep', 'intelligent', 'are', 'left', 'feeling', 'admiration', 'man', 'done', 'wrong', 'things', 'always', 'attempting', 'do', 'what', 'right']",Jesse Stone: Sea Change

Stone is in his late 30s and Selleck is much older. However, Selleck nails the character. Selleck plays a character who has no hope, but almost can't himself trying to do his duty and help people. Selleck nails the charm and despair Jesse has in the books just right. The rest of the acting is strong. The plot varies quite a bit from the book, but that is fine. The plot works. His psychiatrist tells him to find something important to do so Jesse decides to solve a cold case in his files. As soon as he gets started on the case, a questionable rape case is introduced. The mysteries plod along on their own path. Jesse slowly turns over the clues very skillfully using his LAPD experience and his knowledge of people.

It's well acted, nicely shot, and there's a pretty good story, too, involving an old, unsolved bank heist and an unsavory crime aboard a visiting yacht.  However, this fourth adaptation (the first four movies are adapted from specific Robert B. Parker novels) also features a noticeable amount of repetition and wheel-spinning: Jesse once again is seen struggling with alcohol, with no progress one way or the other; he once again is seen fixating on his ex-wife Jenn, with no progress one way or the other; and he once again is seen helping a young person in an awkward, uncomfortable situation.  All that stuff is in the books, too, but for some reason those books (there are seven or eight of them at this point) don't come off as retreads of each other.  Maybe because the original novels are rich with plot and story points covering other themes, too, elements that couldn't be fit into the movies.This repetition and lack of movement on certain issues still qualifies as a nit pick, though.  After all, how many of us struggle with certain issues indefinitely throughout our lives, and how many of us gravitate to addressing the same kinds of problems we see around us, the way Jesse zeroes in on troubled kids and tries to help them?  A lot of us on both counts, I'll wager.Still, it'd be nice to see a Jesse Stone movie that would perhaps back-burner (not eliminate, just de-emphasize) the drinking, troubled youth, and the pining for the ex-wife, and explore other aspects of Jesse's character.  And that might happen: as I write this, the fifth and sixth ""Jesse Stone"" movies are in various stages of production, and they're not based on specific Parker novels, just the book series in general (the new movies will be called ""Thin Ice"" and ""No Remorse"").  So, we might get to see a little extra freshness in future installments of this already very good series of TV films.",4,"Worth seeing, though we've seen a lot of this before",1225929600,"11 6, 2008",2008,1965,"['liked', 'first', 'three', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'TV', 'films', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'one', 'too', 'well', 'acted', 'nicely', 'shot', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'too', 'involving', 'old', 'unsolved', 'bank', 'heist', 'unsavory', 'crime', 'visiting', 'yacht', 'However', 'fourth', 'adaptation', 'first', 'four', 'movies', 'are', 'adapted', 'specific', 'Robert', 'B.', 'Parker', 'novels', 'also', 'noticeable', 'amount', 'repetition', 'wheel-spinning', 'Jesse', 'once', 'again', 'seen', 'struggling', 'alcohol', 'progress', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'once', 'again', 'seen', 'fixating', 'ex-wife', 'Jenn', 'progress', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'once', 'again', 'seen', 'helping', 'young', 'person', 'awkward', 'uncomfortable', 'situation', 'stuff', 'books', 'too', 'reason', 'books', 'are', 'seven', 'eight', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'retreads', 'other', 'Maybe', 'original', 'novels', 'are', 'rich', 'plot', 'story', 'points', 'covering', 'other', 'themes', 'too', 'elements', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'fit', 'movies.This', 'repetition', 'lack', 'movement', 'certain', 'issues', 'still', 'nit', 'pick', 'though', 'how', 'many', 'struggle', 'certain', 'issues', 'indefinitely', 'lives', 'how', 'many', 'gravitate', 'addressing', 'same', 'kinds', 'problems', 'see', 'way', 'Jesse', 'troubled', 'kids', 'tries', 'help', 'lot', 'counts', ""'ll"", 'wager.Still', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'movie', 'would', 'perhaps', 'back-burner', 'not', 'eliminate', 'just', 'de-emphasize', 'drinking', 'troubled', 'youth', 'pining', 'ex-wife', 'explore', 'other', 'aspects', 'Jesse', 'character', 'might', 'happen', 'write', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'movies', 'are', 'various', 'stages', 'production', ""'re"", 'not', 'based', 'specific', 'Parker', 'novels', 'just', 'book', 'series', 'general', 'new', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'called', 'Thin', 'Ice', 'Remorse', 'So', 'might', 'get', 'see', 'little', 'extra', 'freshness', 'future', 'installments', 'already', 'very', 'good', 'series', 'TV', 'films']",Jesse Stone: Sea Change

It evolves delightfully, adding layers to the depth of characters and plots.  In this episode, a cold case is revived.  Jesse looks more bored than his dog does, and his astute shrink suggests he finds something to interest him.  Great idea!He asks an officer in his department about any old cold cases, and there are some--one that occurred in the past 20 years, in fact.  So, he starts sleuthing and finds some inconsistencies and shoddy detective work...which leads to a plot line I haven't seen before which is always fun.Other beloved characters make cameo appearances and bring continuity and cohesiveness to the show.  As usual, there's the visually stunning scenery as a backdrop (Halifax, Nova Scotia Canada not MA, but who cares as it's gorgeous), the lyrical and haunting music, inspired acting and dialog and you never know where the script is heading which keeps it fresh.I loved this particular episode.  Selleck seems even more comfortable with his role as Jesse Stone and I think he's even drinking less--the role suits him.  He needs a new love interest, however.  Maybe the next episode?

We are not told why he no longer likes him. Suitcase is given very little to do in this movie after he recovers. When he is onscreen, his performance is wooden. Molly is gone, but we are not entirely sure why she is gone. From the very beginning, it is as if we are already in the middle of the film. Stone is angry throughout the entire storyline. Angry without reason. This is possibly the worst scripting on any Tom Selleck film I have seen yet. I hope that in the next entry of Jesse Stone, the script writer who worked on this film has been fired and replaced with someone who knows how to write a quality script.

""Sea Change""  is an old time detective story with Tom Selleck returning to his role as Chief Jesse Stone of Paradise Cove.What does an ex Los Angeles cop do as a bored Chief of police?If he's not drinking or issuing parking tickets, he's going through the files of the sloppy ex chief who passed away from corruption in the first installment of the series.  This time, he drags out a 15 year old bank robbery that appears to be a simple case.  With usual Paradise Cove proficiency, the files are incomplete and the excavated grave yields just enough evidence to pique his interest.The pieces are scanty.  Blood stained clothing.  A sharp shooter security guard who claims he did not miss the robber.  A confession from a crooked bank manager who is 'fond of you (Jesse Stone)'.  Jesse finds himself attracted to a young lady seemingly caring for her mother with honest money.  All the pieces fall into place and the solution slams a romance into the ground.The laid back, soft drinking Jesse deals with the money launderer, the bank robbers, and a perverted racer in town for the anual regatta.This is a detective show with class.  Selleck portrays the self torturing Stone with high regard for the books the film is based on.

Still battling inner demons [his alcoholism is very much part of the storyline, though it is not explored in depth, more of frequent shots showing Jesse downing one drink after another], and still in touch with his ex-wife, Chief Jesse ponders on his life which seems rather ho-hum, until something pops up in the form of an alleged rape during the town's Race Week, and also a 12-year-old cold case which Jesse re-opens.If you like slow-simmering police procedurals that focus more on character development than action sequences, then this is a must-watch. It may be a TV movie, but it has an engaging storyline and beautiful cinematography and is better than some of the insipid big-screen offerings.",5,Another engaging instalment in the Jesse Stone series,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,1155,"['fourth', 'series', 'centering', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'Paradise', 'MA', 'may', 'be', 'small', 'town', 'not', 'quite', 'sleepy', 'hollow', 'Instead', 'always', 'mystery', 'lurking', 'idyllic', 'setting', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'insightful', 'characterizations', 'leading', 'players', 'Chief', 'Jesse', 'played', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'multi-faceted', 'character', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'who', 'enigmatic', 'charismatic', 'same', 'time', 'Still', 'battling', 'inner', 'demons', '[', 'alcoholism', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'storyline', 'not', 'explored', 'depth', 'more', 'frequent', 'shots', 'showing', 'Jesse', 'downing', 'one', 'drink', ']', 'still', 'touch', 'ex-wife', 'Chief', 'Jesse', 'ponders', 'life', 'rather', 'ho-hum', 'something', 'pops', 'up', 'form', 'alleged', 'rape', 'town', 'Race', 'Week', 'also', '12-year-old', 'cold', 'case', 'Jesse', 're-opens.If', 'slow-simmering', 'police', 'procedurals', 'focus', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'action', 'sequences', 'then', 'must-watch', 'may', 'be', 'TV', 'movie', 'engaging', 'storyline', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'better', 'insipid', 'big-screen', 'offerings']",Jesse Stone: Sea Change
