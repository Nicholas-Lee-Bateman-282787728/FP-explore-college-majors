Uhh...I don't think so.Minus *one* star for the absurd price for a split season, especially after last year when you offered a ""part one"" then the ""full season"" without immediately offering a ""part two"". Are you not milking this cash cow enough, 20th Century Fox? I'll hold out for the full season at a reasonable price, thanks. (People do have DVRs, you know - if you want buyer loyalty, how about meeting us halfway?)But I'm NOT just dinging the rating because of the marketing...minus *two more* stars for the general drop in the quality of the show. Aside from Kurt and his Dad (and two well deserved Emmy nominations for Colfer and O'Malley), the bulk of the characters have become whiny and unlikeable, especially Will and Rachel. Only Brittany and Sue (and sometimes Santana) are worth watching. The storylines seem tired. The musical choices are spotty. Gwyneth Paltrow's guest appearance was outstanding but overall this is a textbook sophomore slump to date.Let's hope they pick it up in the second half and close strong.

The whole cast is amazing. The only negative is this 1st half season DVD. I learned my lesson, as I purchased "" The Road to sectionals "" which was the half of season 1...it left me wanting more. Plus I also learned when the complete DVD Glee season 1 came out, it was less expensive. So , I'm going to wait, and watch it all together and save a little bit of money. I too also hope that the lower ratings weren't because of this half season, as it doesn't reflect the show in of it self.

1396741,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B004DCB2CG,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[2, 2]","SPOILERS FOLLOWFirst, I love ""Glee,"" and don't completely begrudge them releasing a half-season to DVD.  I was a latecomer, and wouldn't have been able to catch up to the show easily if they hadn't done the same thing with the first season.This set includes the first several episodes of the second season, beginning with ""Audition.""  The show  is not a great premiere, going through the motions in terms of exposition to set up a feud.  The songs for the premiere are exceptional, from Jay-Z's ""Empire State of Mind"" to Travie McCoy's ""Billionaire,"" everything works musically.  Chord Overstreet's Sam Evans is introduced, and has been a mostly welcome addition.  But, the more intriguing Charice, as Sunshine Corazon, has not been seen or even referenced since.  Dot-Marie Jones has been a blast as McKinley High's new football coach.Standout episodes are ""Grilled Cheesus"", ""Furt"",(a great episode exploring the relationship between Chris Colfer's Kurt Hummel and Cory Monteith's Finn Hudson) ""A Very Glee Christmas"", and ""The Substitute,"" the first of several episodes guest-starring Gwyneth Paltrow.I think ""Glee"" is phenomenal, but the decision of whether or not to buy a half-season is an individual one.

1396742,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B004DCB2CG,Haunted Flower,"[4, 6]","10 Episodes on 3 Discs, released January 25, 2011Ten episodes on three discs feels like they are really milking this one, but I can't blame them for scheduling the act break right after the Christmas episode. Just when I was about ready to give up on ""Glee"", it went and got pretty good again. The first few episodes of the second season in my opinion were lackluster. The old plot lines seemed to fizzle out, Mr. Schuester (Matthew Morrison) was trying to steal guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) from the hot dentist played by John Stamos, and the theme episodes were starting to get out of control. I didn't care about the characters anymore. The Britney episode was very funny, but didn't tell a story anymore, it was just silly excuses for song & dance numbers. After watching all of Season One and the first four episodes of Season Two, I quit ""Glee"", certain I wouldn't return.Then a major turnaround occurred after the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" theme episode. Kurt (Chris Colfer) was put in a major arc about gays being bullied and we were introduced to a new love interest for him, Blaine (Darren Criss). Kurt and Finn (Cory Monteith) became brothers when their parents were married in a very emotional episode. Embracing stories around Kurt was a big plus for this show. He is one of the most real feeling and emotional characters on the show as we can tell by Chris Colfer's recent Golden Globe win. New cast member, Darren Criss has that crossover appeal to men and women and a pretty amazing voice (then again, which cast member doesn't have a great voice?). It doesn't take as long to get to Sectionals as it did before and it isn't the center of the Glee universe anymore. We aren't using every single episode as an excuse to have a song we ""might"" use for Sectionals. Bigger issues are in play with relationships between students and Kurt transferring to another school.Also there was a big plus of a few episodes of Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) as Principal of the school and she curbs her own bullying to help stop the bullying of others, including guest star Carol Burnett who plays Sue's mother. Another big guest star was Britney Spears during the Britney-themed episode which was pretty exciting. Also Gwyneth Paltrow guest-starred as a substitute teacher when Schuester was sick to let the kids have more say in their musical selection so they weren't all ""50 years old"" or Journey songs.One of my favorite new characters is Coach Beiste played by Dot Jones. This woman in real life is a 15 time World and 10 time National arm-wrestling champion and is a real beast of a woman with a heart of gold. Her character is so shy and sweet and she is just as much of an outcast as the Glee club members. After the ""Never Been Kissed"" and Christmas episodes (LOVED the whole Christmas episode), I am hooked on her.So just as it garnered so much enthusiasm last year, it's worth holding on for this year, give ""Glee"" a chance. It will more often warm your heart than make you roll your eyes.Bonus Features:As with Season 1, there is a Glee music jukebox where you can set up a shuffle rotation of music from the second season to keep you company at a party or whatever. In ""Getting Waxed with Jane Lynch"", you get to watch the character of Sue Sylvester getting immortalized as a wax sculpture. Letting her talk at any time is a good idea and the anatomy of making a wax sculpture and all the measurements is more interesting than I thought it'd be. ""The Wit of Brittany"" is just a ton of great quotes looped together demonstrating her intelligence. Her one-liners are the funniest part of the show outside of Jane Lynch. You can also see Glee at Comic-Con! Wow, I knew nerds cheered for superheros a lot at these, never thought I'd see ""Glee"" as a part of Comic-Con, the people LOVE them. Chris Colfer pulled the smart move by wearing a Transformers Decepticon icon t-shirt. If you like listening to people scream after every sentence people say, this is the extra for you. It's a little dated because they talk about things they want to do that they end up doing during this season.If you needed more ""Rocky Horror"", there is an exclusive bonus song that didn't make it to the show -- ""Planet, Schmanet, Janet"". Pretty glad they cut this since it's the same thing as the actual opening to the episode - a pair of lips singing with a black background. Big let down and boring to watch, thankfully short. The one they chose was much better. You can also watch the making of ""The Rocky Horror Glee Show"". It makes me wish they had done a making of special for the Britney themed episode which is what I originally thought ""The Wit of Brittany"" might have been. It would have been cool to see Britney Spears on the set working with the actors and seeing the choreography and recreating music video moments.",4,"Glee take a time out, but came back

1396743,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004DCB2CG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 4]","It's still tongue-in-cheek. It's still over-the-top. It's still shockingly addictive, and - me, being a manly man - I'm still mortified that I'm hooked on GLEE (I cringe like a mother every time I hear the label ""gleek""). Anyway, our teen bunch of outcasts and outsiders return to McKingley High for another season of glee club shenanigans, ridiculous angst, and facial slushies. Big dreamer that he is, Will Schuester, the glee club director, has set his eyes on the Nationals which, this year, is taking place in New York (and so, right away, we get a neat rendition of Jay-Z's ""Empire State of Mind""). However, budget cuts all around hamstring not only the glee club but also Sue Sylvester's cheerleading squad. This treats us to an unholy alliance between Mr. Shoe and Sue Sylvester, especially since the new - and scary - football coach threatens to muck things up for them both.The musical performances are what draw us in, but there's no escaping those high school romances. In these ten episodes, we see familiar couples and new pairings, some of them really unexpected (some of them brought about by poor writing). Mr. Shoe is still chasing the school's chaste guidance counselor, Emma Pillsbury, except that Emma is now dating a handsome devil of a dentist (John Stamos, in a recurring role) and, shockingly, she isn't as much of a neat freak, what with the cool dentist gradually weaning her off her phobias. And, yes, for good or evil, John Stamos gets to sing a number.Folks depart, folks arrive. New Directions get new members, one of them a jock eerily resembling McCauley Culkin. New Directions also lose two members, one of whom is a key contributor. Rachel Berry (Lea Michelle), last season's most prominent character, takes more of a back seat this season as the less-featured of the cast are showcased. To demonstrate how huge this show's blown up, even more marquee names grace the guest star roster. The show devotes an episode to Britney Spears and features a cameo by Britney herself (and also gives ditzy Brittany more camera time). And maybe you can twig onto why Sue Sylvester is the way she is when you learn that her parents neglected her childhood to go hunt Nazis. Carol Burnett storms in as Sue's mother. Meat Loaf and Barry Bostwick cameo in GLEE's homage to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, an episode which also features Emma Pillsbury performing ""Touch-a, Touch-a Touch Me,"" which was Jayma May's original audition piece for the series. And in probably my favorite episode of the season so far, ""The Substitute"" has Gwyneth Paltrow brilliantly subbing for an ailing Mr. Shoe in his Spanish and glee club classes (and we also get the awesome mash-up song ""Umbrella/Singin' In The Rain""). Meanwhile, Filipino singing sensation Charice shows up in the first episode and promptly makes Rachel nervous with her big voice. Charice's character's audition piece (""Listen"") for the glee club blows the roof off.And one of my favorite shticks resurfaces with the episode ""Duets,"" which again pits the boys against the girls. ""Duets"" gives us Amber & Santana getting their R&B; on with ""River Deep - Mountain High"" and Mike Chang & Tina's cute interpretation of ""Sing!"" Yes, Mike Chang sings. Sort of.Two things to nitpick: One, the ""Make 'Em Laugh"" number in ""The Substitute"" didn't work for me, probably because I'm biased for the Donald O'Connor original, and you'd have to do something really amazing to top that or even match it. Two, I was disappointed that Amber played Frank-N-Furter in ""Rocky Horror Glee Show."" I guess the series didn't want to rock the boat, but it would've been crazy cool if Finn or Carl (Stamos) or one of the other guys had played the part. I guess Kurt would've been too obvious.Jane Lynch is awesome, end of discussion. And it's cool to catch up with the GLEE cast. But the writing's been a shade off so far (S. Curley's review covers a lot of the inconsistencies). But give the show some due, GLEE also isn't shy about addressing topical issues, here and there. One example, The ""Rocky Horror Glee Show"" demonstrates that even guys get concerned with their body image. And is that a whiff of satire I sense regarding Asian tokenism? GLEE has also been consistent with showcasing Kurt Hummel, an openly gay glee club member. Somewhere in all the quirkiness and romantic musical chairs and high school politics, there are some truly moving moments. The wedding vow so honestly stated by Kurt's dad to his bride in ""Furt,"" that'll turn a rock into a puddle. There are also some very nice moments with the football coach who is more sympathetic than you'd first think.I'm actually not cheesed at this DVD release. Sometimes, a whole season's worth is simply too long to wait on. As someone said on this site, I work crazy hours and don't own a TIVO or DVR. So no complaints from me this time. Ten episodes ain't nothing to sneeze at. I tend to get my feelings more hurt when a DVD's only offering, say, four episodes a pop.GLEE Season 2, Vol. 1 has the first ten episodes (which take New Directions all the way to the Sectionals) and these bonus features, on 3 discs: the GLEE Music Jukebox gives you direct access to the musical performances; the DVD World Premiere exclusive bonus song ""Planet, Schmanet, Janet""; The Making of the Rocky Horror GLEE Show (00:06:48 minutes); ""Getting Waxed with Jane Lynch"" - the process of creating a Madame Tussaud wax statue of Jane Lynch or, more accurately, of Sue Sylvester (00:06:09); ""The Wit of Brittany"" - a cavalcade of Brittany's best (and sometimes very non-sequitur) lines (00:02:21); and the GLEE panel (but minus the lead actors) doing Q & A at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con (00:14:54).",4,"""Fresh off their last place finish at the Regionals, please give it up for the New Directions.""",1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,5689,"['still', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'still',

1396746,A11LBH38IDQNXN,B004DCB2CG,Jean M.,"[6, 8]","As a big Glee fan, I am sorry to say that this first half of season 2 is a little disappointing.  The first season was so well written.  When Glee season 2 started, fans were welcomed by almost plot-less and sometimes rushed filler episodes.  The episodes Grilled Cheesus, Never been Kissed, The Substitute and A Very Glee Christmas were the only really good episodes.  The rest although were fun to watch, didn't really move the plot along.  We hardly see any Emma or any Terri.*Contains spoilers*:Audition 6/10: Season premier could have been better.  We see Tina all of a sudden dating Mark Chang, which I personally don't like.  We meet Sunshine (who doesn't appear at all for the rest of the volume), Ms. Beiste, the new football coach and Sam, a jock.Britney/Brittany 5/10: In the Madonna themed episode, they cooperated her songs in the story. In the Britney Spears themed episode, the kids fantasize about Britney musical numbers while at the dentist.  There was no major plot in this episode that moved the story along.  They pretty much forced the Britney songs into this episode.  And apparently, Emma is dating a dentist.Grilled Cheesus 8/10:  The controversial theme episode about religion finally has some kind of storyline to advance with.  Kurt's dad is in the hospital and the kids all pray for him while Finn finds a grilled cheese with Jesus' face in it.Duets 6/10: Puck all of a sudden is in juvie for some reason.  It's also time, like last season, for duets.  It has a-what-feels-like-a-forced relationship between Quinn and Sam.  The episodes ending felt rushed.The Rocky Horror Glee Show 7/10:  This episode was really well done considering that it was directed by Adam Shankman, the director of Hairspray.  Again, this episode does nothing to the plot, just some scenes with a jealous Will and trying to win Emma's affection.Never Been Kissed 9/10: The kids have images of the Beiste in revealing outfits to turn themselves off when they get aroused.  Meanwhile, Kurt is tired of getting harassed by a school bully so he visits a different school.  There was a nice scene in this episode where Beiste and Will kiss.  It was so sweet.  There's some character development in this episode as well.The Substitute 9/10:  A fun episode where Gweneth Paltrow guests stars as a cool substitute while Will gets sick.  It was well done as well.Furt 6/10:  Kurt and Finn's parents are getting married and Kurt changes school's.  This episode was nice.  It was a bit rushed at times.Special Education 6/10: It's finally time for Sectionals, but again, like the Duet episode, they make a big deal out of Sectionals and it's something that they were waiting for so much, but when they go to Sectionals, it felt very rushed.A Very Glee Christmas 9/10:  A wonderful episode that puts you into the holiday spirit.  Again, the writers gave Beiste a really heartfelt speech like in Never Been Kissed.  They also give homage to other classic Christmas specials.",3,The first half of Glee Season 2 is just ok.,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,2966,"['big', 'Glee', 'fan', 'am', 'sorry', 'say', 'first', 'half', 'season', '2', 'little', 'disappointing', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'When', 'Glee', 'season', '2', 'started', 'fans', 'were', 'welcomed', 'almost', 'plot-less', 'sometimes', 'rushed', 'filler', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'Grilled', 'Cheesus', 'Never', 'been', 'Kissed', 'Substitute', 'A', 'Very', 'Glee', 'Christmas', 'were', 'only', 'really', 'good', 'episodes', 'rest', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'move', 'plot', 'hardly', 'see', 'Emma', 'Terri', 'spoilers*', 'Audition', '6/10', 'Season', 'premier', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'see', 'Tina', 'sudden', 'dating', 'Mark', 'Chang', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'meet', 'Sunshine', 'who', ""n't"", 'appear', 'rest', 'volume', 'Ms.', 'Beiste', 'new', 'football', 'coach', 'Sam', 'jock.Britney/Brittany', '5/10', 'Madonna', 'themed', 'episode', 'cooperated', 'songs', 'story', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'themed', 'episode', 'kids', 'fantasize', 'Britney', 'musical', 'numbers', 'dentist', 'was', 'major', 'plot', 'episode', 'moved', 'story', 'along', 'pretty', 'much', 'forced', 'Britney', 'songs', 'episode', 'apparently', 'Emma', 'dating', 'dentist.Grilled', 'Cheesus', '8/10', 'controversial', 'theme', 'episode', 'religion', 'finally', 'kind', 'storyline', 'advance', 'Kurt', 'dad', 'hospital', 'kids', 'pray', 'Finn', 'grilled', 'cheese', 'Jesus', 'face', 'it.Duets', '6/10', 'Puck', 'sudden', 'juvie', 'reason', 'also', 'time', 'last', 'season', 'duets', 'a-what-feels-like-a-forced', 'relationship', 'Quinn', 'Sam', 'episodes', 'ending', 'felt', 'rushed.The', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Glee', 'Show', '7/10', 'episode', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'considering', 'was', 'directed', 'Adam', 'Shankman', 'director', 'Hairspray', 'Again', 'episode', 'nothing', 'plot', 'just', 'scenes', 'jealous', 'Will', 'trying', 'win', 'Emma', 'affection.Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', '9/10', 'kids', 'have', 'images', 'Beiste', 'revealing', 'outfits', 'turn', 'off', 'when', 'get', 'aroused', 'Meanwhile', 'Kurt', 'tired', 'getting', 'harassed', 'school', 'bully', 'so', 'different', 'school', 'was', 'nice', 'scene', 'episode', 'where', 'Beiste', 'Will', 'kiss', 'was', 'so', 'sweet', 'character', 'development', 'episode', 'well.The', 'Substitute', '9/10', 'fun', 'episode', 'where', 'Gweneth', 'Paltrow', 'stars', 'cool', 'substitute', 'Will', 'sick', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'well.Furt', '6/10', 'Kurt', 'Finn', 'parents', 'are', 'getting', 'married', 'Kurt', 'school', 'episode', 'was', 'nice', 'was', 'bit', 'rushed', 'times.Special', 'Education', '6/10', 'finally', 'time', 'Sectionals', 'again', 'Duet', 'episode', 'make', 'big', 'deal', 'Sectionals', 'something', 'were', 'waiting', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'go', 'Sectionals', 'felt', 'very', 'rushed.A', 'Very', 'Glee', 'Christmas', '9/10', 'wonderful', 'episode', 'holiday', 'spirit', 'Again', 'writers', 'gave', 'Beiste', 'really', 'heartfelt', 'speech', 'Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', 'also', 'give', 'homage', 'other', 'classic', 'Christmas', 'specials']","Glee: Season 2, Volume 1"

1396750,A1EQ5JEKG8BCFV,B004DCB2CG,"Midan ""Nerdy Kid""","[6, 11]","Yeah, ""Glee"" has definitely set the standards for quality television. A teen show, nonetheless entertaining, with sexy story lines, style, and--of course--singing! Here are a few issues I have with the release of this video:1. It is rushed. Unlike the ""Season One - Vol. One"" DVD released in late December 2009, this DVD has yet to assemble a decent fight in the ring with its predecessor. The first thirteen episodes of ""Glee"" were flawless--and I mean FLAWLESS, but the second season lacks believability. Not only are the characters becoming repetitive and shallow, the new characters (or characters we have grown to love) are not as enticing. Sue is hardly seen anymore, now with Sam (portrayed by Chord Overstreet) and Beiste (portrayed by Dot-Marie Jones) coming in, gradually stealing the spotlight. On the other hand, characters who hardly ever talked are speaking for the very first time, in sentences (Mike Chang)!2. We know the drill, get to Nationals. Okay, so who cares about Finchel, Furt, Puckleberry, St. Berry, or whatever anymore? I want interaction between the parents--people who we hardly ever (or never) see. Where are Rachel's two gay dads, Artie's parents, or Puck's long-lost older brother who so happens to be a vocalist? There are too many circles, and I know that I am not the only one getting dizzy.3. Don't put anymore money into these bastards' pockets. Wait until the full DVD is released in August/September. Like most of you, I purchased the Vol. One DVD from the first season, which is awesome, nonetheless--but, it is, however, a rip-off if they plan to release the entire season for the same price as the second volume (which previously happened). I never ended up getting the second volume because a.) I already saw the episodes and b.) it was a ridiculous attempt to make some money. You would be better off going to third-party websites like Hulu.com to watch the five trailing episodes and more. Trust me, this will get you by until the hiatus is over. You know you watched these episodes religiously anyway, so why pay for what you know?The season, for me, has a ""C+"" rating. The original rating for me would be a ""C-"", but Kurt's bullying saga kind of made me realize why I started watching the show again. Gwen's episode, is also really great. The episodes are so-so, not too many great moments, but plenty of one-liners by Sue (which gives me the chills and chuckles).If you are thinking about getting the DVD, don't. It will be September in no time, and you can actually enjoy them all simultaneously. Take a true Gleek's advice.We have, in this boxed-set:10 episodes, with two themed-shows, featuring music from pop-singer Britney Spears and the cult-classic musical ""Rocky Horror"".Sure the DVD has plenty of extras and what not, but just think with your pennies before you Glee-gasm.--MidanAllen.com",3,"Glee-tastic, but...",1292630400,"12 18, 2010",2010,2846,"['Yeah', 'Glee', 'definitely', 'set', 'standards', 'quality', 'television', 'teen', 'show', 'nonetheless', 'entertaining', 'sexy', 'story', 'lines', 'style', 'course', 'singing', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'issues', 'have', 'release', 'video:1', 'rushed', 'Season', 'One', 'Vol', 'One', 'DVD', 'released', 'late', 'December', '2009', 'DVD', 'yet', 'assemble', 'decent', 'fight', 'ring', 'predecessor', 'first', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'Glee', 'were', 'flawless', 'mean', 'FLAWLESS', 'second', 'season', 'believability', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'characters', 'becoming', 'repetitive', 'shallow', 'new', 'characters', 'characters', 'have', 'grown', 'love', 'are', 'not', 'enticing', 'Sue', 'hardly', 'seen', 'anymore', 'now', 'Sam', 'portrayed', 'Chord', 'Overstreet', 'Beiste', 'portrayed', 'Dot-Marie', 'Jones', 'coming', 'gradually', 'stealing', 'spotlight', 'other', 'hand', 'characters', 'who', 'hardly', 'ever', 'talked', 'are', 'speaking', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'sentences', 'Mike', 'Chang', '2', 'know', 'drill', 'get', 'Nationals', 'Okay', 'who', 'Finchel', 'Furt', 'Puckleberry', 'St.', 'Berry', 'anymore', 'want', 'interaction', 'parents', 'people', 'who', 'hardly', 'ever', 'never', 'see', 'Where', 'are', 'Rachel', 'two', 'gay', 'dads', 'Artie', 'parents', 'Puck', 'long-lost', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'so', 'be', 'vocalist', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'circles', 'know', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'getting', 'dizzy.3', 'Do', ""n't"", 'put', 'anymore', 'money', 'bastards', 'pockets', 'Wait', 'full', 'DVD', 'released', 'August/September', 'most', 'purchased', 'Vol', 'One', 'DVD', 'first', 'season', 'awesome', 'nonetheless', 'however', 'rip-off', 'plan', 'release', 'entire', 'season', 'same', 'price', 'second', 'volume', 'previously', 'happened', 'never', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'second', 'volume', 'already', 'saw', 'episodes', 'b', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'attempt', 'make', 'money', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'going', 'third-party', 'websites', 'Hulu.com', 'watch', 'five', 'trailing', 'episodes', 'more', 'Trust', 'will', 'get', 'hiatus', 'over', 'know', 'watched', 'episodes', 'religiously', 'anyway', 'so', 'why', 'pay', 'what', 'know', 'season', 'C+', 'rating', 'original', 'rating', 'would', 'be', 'C-', 'Kurt', 'bullying', 'saga', 'kind', 'made', 'realize', 'why', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'again', 'Gwen', 'episode', 'also', 'really', 'great', 'episodes', 'are', 'so-so', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'great', 'moments', 'plenty', 'one-liners', 'Sue', 'chills', 'chuckles', '.If', 'are', 'thinking', 'getting', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'will', 'be', 'September', 'time', 'can', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'simultaneously', 'Take', 'true', 'Gleek', 'advice.We', 'have', 'boxed-set:10', 'episodes', 'two', 'themed-shows', 'featuring', 'music', 'pop-singer', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'cult-classic', 'musical', 'Rocky', 'Horror', '.Sure', 'DVD', 'plenty', 'extras', 'what', 'not', 'just', 'think', 'pennies', 'Glee-gasm.', 'MidanAllen.com']","Glee: Season 2, Volume 1"

Although I haven't yet seen the second season since I don't have live television here in the woods of Appalachia, my husband and I have really enjoyed the first season. While many people comment about the half-season releases and cost (and leave not-so-positive remarks), I am sure that it costs quite a bit of money to bring this show to us (several million dollars for some episodes, I have read).With actors, writers, sets, costumes, locations, live musicians, etc., this show is very expensive to create, I am sure. And people are complaining about paying $20-30 to see a half season of such quality entertainment? I don't understand that. That is less than the price of one ticket to a show and we get a half season of comedy, drama, amazing musical numbers, and ground-breaking opportunities for people to view and understand characters that represent many diverse groups and individuals in our culture.That kind of a quality production doesn't come cheap and we are so fortunate to have the opportunity to experience this at such a reasonable price. And from what I have read, this was an important season for breaking stereotypes and encouraging acceptance of others. How brave for a show to be one of the first to spotlight issues like bullying, encourage tolerance, and include characters that represent our actual population, not one televisually created by those ""in power.""I would encourage people to purchase this set and pay retail in order to support such quality television and the people who bring it to us. If we don't honor those who give us something worthwhile, shows like this won't long exist in the production world of cut budgets, cheap sitcoms, and inane reality shows. Our support will ensure that quality programming will continue to happen.

1396754,A39W3263A9HCMN,B004DCB2CG,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[2, 3]","Like many others, I enjoyed (half of) Season One. That half would be the first half of course. It was something new and fresh, it spoke to people in many ways, and thespians and people of all sex, race, sexual orientation were united. Even my dad loves it too. So of course, imagine my surprise upon finding out I had to wait half a year for new episodes. Then April 2010 came, and Hell-O was pretty good... but the rest of the season wasn't. Yes, I am one of those people who thought the show just stopped being good halfay into Season 1. It's like they got completely new and inexperienced writers. That, and Season 2 follows in the footsteps of Season 1 part 2.First off, it's easy to see they've gotten new crew, because the show has a dull, monotone and almost completely flat look to it now. Whereas Season One was nice and colorful, Season 2 has mostly muted colors and looks more like something out of a Bourne movie. That, and the shaky Camera is even worse here. Sure there was some shaky camera in season one, but it was used very sparingly. Here, it's even used in some musical numbers, and at times it's hard to understand what's going on. It does not feel documentarian, it feels like a man with Parkinsons filmed it. Back on the subject of the colour pallette, I do get it takes place during winter in some scenes, but so did Season 1 and there it looked like they put actual visual thought into it.I have only been satisfied by a handful of episodes. Despite what a lot of people said, I thought Audition was a fantastic episode and a great start. Telephone was quirky and funny, and I thought it set the tone for a good rest of the season. Never Been Kissed is an excellent episode too, and Chris Colfer really shows how good he can acthere, as the conflict levels are high, and it's like Season one of Glee. Furt is cool too, and A Very Glee Christmas was in a word, AMAZING. I actually shed a few tears at the end because it really makes you realize the true meaning of christmas. It was very reminiscent of season one, and on the mark.The rest is all either garbage or a severe missed opportunity. There was absolutely no reason for the Britney episode, although it was worth it for Heather Morris' dancing. The Rocky Horror episode was a complete missed opportunity, it was almost like a parody of RH. Duets was pointless, Grilled Cheesus was boring and full of Melodrama, Special Education was some of the worst crap I've ever seen WITH the most obvious autotune in the world on Time of my Life. Worst of all was The Substitute. I love Gwenyth Paltrow, but that episode just stunk out loud. Garbage plot, pointless appearance by Paltrow, plus Forget You was AWFUL!!!!!!In short, as of writing, I have seen what there is so far of Part 2, and it is getting better. I liked Comeback and LOVED Silly Love Songs, but Sue Sylvester Shuffle was a total disaster- why are they dressed as zombies and doing Thriller? Otherwise, I can't recommend the season if the rest of the season looks to be like this half of Season 2.",2,Throw a slushee on it,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,3036,"['many', 'others', 'enjoyed', 'half', 'Season', 'One', 'half', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'half', 'course', 'was', 'something', 'new', 'fresh', 'spoke', 'people', 'many', 'ways', 'thespians', 'people', 'sex', 'race', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'were', 'united', 'Even', 'dad', 'too', 'So', 'course', 'imagine', 'surprise', 'finding', 'out', 'had', 'wait', 'year', 'new', 'episodes', 'Then', 'April', '2010', 'came', 'Hell-O', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'rest', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'Yes', 'am', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'thought', 'show', 'just', 'stopped', 'being', 'good', 'halfay', 'Season', '1', 'got', 'completely', 'new', 'inexperienced', 'writers', 'Season', '2', 'footsteps', 'Season', '1', 'part', '2.First', 'easy', 'see', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'new', 'crew', 'show', 'dull', 'monotone', 'almost', 'completely', 'flat', 'look', 'now', 'Whereas', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'nice', 'colorful', 'Season', '2', 'mostly', 'muted', 'colors', 'more', 'something', 'Bourne', 'movie', 'shaky', 'Camera', 'even', 'worse', 'here', 'Sure', 'was', 'shaky', 'camera', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'used', 'very', 'sparingly', 'Here', 'even', 'used', 'musical', 'numbers', 'times', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'not', 'feel', 'documentarian', 'man', 'Parkinsons', 'filmed', 'Back', 'subject', 'colour', 'pallette', 'do', 'get', 'place', 'winter', 'scenes', 'so', 'did', 'Season', '1', 'looked', 'put', 'actual', 'visual', 'thought', 'it.I', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'satisfied', 'handful', 'episodes', 'what', 'lot', 'people', 'said', 'thought', 'Audition', 'was', 'fantastic', 'episode', 'great', 'start', 'Telephone', 'was', 'quirky', 'funny', 'thought', 'set', 'tone', 'good', 'rest', 'season', 'Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', 'excellent', 'episode', 'too', 'Chris', 'Colfer', 'really', 'how', 'good', 'can', 'acthere', 'conflict', 'levels', 'are', 'high', 'Season', 'one', 'Glee', 'Furt', 'cool', 'too', 'Very', 'Glee', 'Christmas', 'was', 'word', 'AMAZING', 'actually', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'end', 'really', 'realize', 'true', 'meaning', 'christmas', 'was', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'season', 'one', 'mark.The', 'rest', 'either', 'garbage', 'severe', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'was', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'Britney', 'episode', 'was', 'worth', 'Heather', 'Morris', 'dancing', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'episode', 'was', 'complete', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'was', 'almost', 'parody', 'RH', 'Duets', 'was', 'pointless', 'Grilled', 'Cheesus', 'was', 'boring', 'full', 'Melodrama', 'Special', 'Education', 'was', 'worst', 'crap', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'WITH', 'most', 'obvious', 'autotune', 'world', 'Time', 'Life', 'Worst', 'was', 'Substitute', 'love', 'Gwenyth', 'Paltrow', 'episode', 'just', 'stunk', 'out', 'loud', 'Garbage', 'plot', 'pointless', 'appearance', 'Paltrow', 'Forget', 'was', 'AWFUL', 'short', 'writing', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'so', 'far', 'Part', '2', 'getting', 'better', 'liked', 'Comeback', 'LOVED', 'Silly', 'Love', 'Songs', 'Sue', 'Sylvester', 'Shuffle', 'was', 'total', 'disaster-', 'why', 'are', 'dressed', 'zombies', 'doing', 'Thriller', 'Otherwise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'season', 'rest', 'season', 'be', 'half', 'Season', '2']","Glee: Season 2, Volume 1"
1396755,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B004DCB2CG,Sean Curley,"[83, 91]","""Glee"" unexpectedly took the TV and music scene by storm following its debut in 2009, and by the end of the first season it was a multimedia juggernaut (and is poised to expand further).  Anticipation for its return reached a fever pitch over the summer, with people wondering where it would go, and whether it would become a victim of its own success - the answer is, a little bit.  The first ten episodes of the season have plenty of strengths compared to the first season, but also many of the same weaknesses, and others that the first season (particularly the first half) didn't have.  As an aside, one can debate the merits of whether you want to buy the season in volumes or as a whole, but it's fairly upfront about the choice, so I don't see the reason to base a review around that.  You can decide for yourself whether you want the set now or want to wait until summer of next year for the whole thing.  Spoilers thing.The first volume consists of ten episodes, from ""Audition"", the season premiere, to ""A Very Glee Christmas"", obviously the Christmas episode.  The ninth and penultimate episode is Sectionals, the first of the three competitions that New Directions will face in the course of the year (after that, Regionals, and then, Nationals).  Two of these ten are ""theme"" episodes focussed on, respectively, Britney Spears music and ""The Rocky Horror Show"" (and its film adaptation, ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show""), while another is more or less built around a guest appearance from Gwyneth Paltrow.  There has been some debate in the fandom about whether the season is being dragged down by an overabundance of themed stuff, but I would, on the whole, say no - this ratio is far from unworkable (and supposedly the rest of the season will have less of this).  And, episode to episode, the show is operating at a level of quality similar to last year.  The problems are derived in great part from the big picture, and here the producers shoot themselves in the foot on a number of occasions.The biggest debate raging in the media and fandom about ""Glee"" at the moment is about Kurt (Chris Colfer):  Kurt is probably the show's breakout character, and certainly the one with the highest degree of social relevance.  The complaints have been multiplying lately about whether Kurt is taking over the show to the detriment of everyone else.  With rare exception, I would again say no - the amount of screentime Kurt is getting is not that out of line with what would be due a major story (and what he got last year).  The other characters, for the most part, don't suffer from a lack of screentime - indeed, the show is actually doing a better job of dividing screentime and songs this year than last year (though a few characters, most notably Mercedes, suffer from this).  Where the writers are actually failing, and why this creates a mistaken perception about Kurt's relative amount of screentime, is in dividing story.  Simply put:  Kurt has a story this year, and, in practice, nobody else does.  Kurt has a storyline with continuity that develops from episode-to-episode, and the other characters have nothing remotely like this.  Most of them could at best be said to be ""dating"" somebody, which in practice amounts to sitting next to them in class and singing together in duets; there are no substantial plots other than Kurt's.  This is particularly marked in the case of Rachel, who used to be the lead character but for most of these episodes could be best described as ""Finn's girlfriend"".  Indeed, none of the girls of ND have any story this year beyond dating one of the guys (Mercedes and Santana aren't dating anyone, that's true, but then, they also have no story).  The producers need to start giving everyone else the level of plot and character continuity they give Kurt.It didn't have to be this way.  Indeed, ""Audition"" seems to set up a number of plots that would cover most of the cast, and from pre-season interviews, these were intended to be storylines.  However, in what can only be called spectacularly shoddy writing, these all vanish within an episode or two.  For instance, creator Ryan Murphy said that Quinn (Dianna Agron) and Santana's (Naya Rivera) story this year was going to be a rivalry over who would be the #1 girl at the school; the first episode has Quinn betray Santana to take back her old spot, leading to a physical fight.  Okay, promising start.  And that's all we ever see of it.  This supposed storyline vanishes without a trace, leaving Quinn to spend the rest of the time dating Sam and Santana, well, doing nothing beyond supplying her usual biting one-liners.  There's a truly baffling about-face with the supposed Artie/Tina/Mike triangle, where Artie suddenly decides he wants to date Brittany between episodes, despite ""Duets"" ending with him saying he loved Tina - ""Duets"" also finally gives some actual seriousness to Santana and Brittany's hinted-at relationship, but subsequent episodes totally drop this too in favour of Artie and Brittany hooking up, with Artie's feelings for Tina and Santana's jealousy seemingly forgotten (that a show that markets itself as very gay-friendly continues to treat the idea of female homosexuality as a silly joke is rather disheartening).  I would have thought that having a full season (indeed, two full seasons) commitment from the network would have allowed the creators to plan things out, but if anything the show is less coherent then ever when viewed as a season-long narrative.So, negativity aside, what does work?  Well, first and foremost, the cast of ""Glee"" remains utterly amazing; even when the writers fall down, they manage to make the show much more coherent than it frequently deserves to be.  Several castmembers get additional spotlight here:  apart from the aforementioned Colfer/Kurt, Heather Morris/Brittany continues to become more important to the show, including her own episode (which was somewhat controversial, with a lot of people hating it for its lack of plot, but I enjoy fluff every now and then, and it was well-done fluff); Morris and Naya Rivera/Santana are now series regulars, and they make the most of their additional screentime.  Rivera, in particular, is rapidly ascending the ranks of the show's main vocalists, delivering two duets and two solo songs in the course of the year, and doing amazing on all of them.  Poor Jenna Ushkowitz/Tina, so frequently ignored despite being an original castmember, also gets more to do here, both singing and dancing (her ""Dog Days Are Over"" is fantastic, and she and Harry Shum, Jr./Mike do a terrific duet of ""Sing!"") - though they still really need to define who her character is and what her role on the show is.  And the writing, while narratively flawed, still has plenty of bite, delivering an onslaught of quotable lines and memorable moments.If the writers could bring some order to all this and write actual stories and consistent character development for people other than Kurt, the show would be absolutely unmatched on TV.  As it is, it's messy and fun, but frustrating given how easily it could be much better if the writers put the effort in.",3,Glee's second season begins both promisingly and
