Haven't watched Company Business, in fact failed to notice it was included.  Have to do that! However, I've seldom been disappointed in anything Gene Hackman has done, and Kevin Kostner was very good in this role too.  It was well plotted, a good mystery, and multiple character's study, to the end. Plus, there were not too many characters to study, which I like in a story.  The action present was present, no special effects, which I also appreciate, as well as the fact that the drama was drama, not articially created with music, or screen darkening, swearing, shouting, etc.I'm referring to the DVD version of the film.",5,"No Way Out, DVD",1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,701,"['had', 'already', 'seen', 'movie', 'TV', 'liked', 'Still', 'video', 'Have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Company', 'Business', 'fact', 'failed', 'notice', 'was', 'included', 'Have', 'do', 'However', ""'ve"", 'seldom', 'been', 'disappointed', 'anything', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'done', 'Kevin', 'Kostner', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'too', 'was', 'well', 'plotted', 'good', 'mystery', 'multiple', 'character', 'study', 'end', 'were', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'study', 'like', 'story', 'action', 'present', 'was', 'present', 'special', 'effects', 'also', 'appreciate', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'drama', 'was', 'drama', 'not', 'articially', 'created', 'music', 'screen', 'darkening', 'swearing', 'shouting', 'etc.I', ""'m"", 'referring', 'DVD', 'version', 'film']",No Way Out / Company Business

What's happening with our taxes at the government level if any of this is plausible or even true! Sedate and a bit dated compared to the extreme tempo of the Bourne series, IMHO. But the Bourne series is extreme, too much maybe.",5,Excellent combo,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,344,"['Good', 'price', 'too', 'Thrillers', 'spies', 'glimpse', 'Sean', 'Young', 'way', 'out', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'always', 'good', 'usual', 'What', 'happening', 'taxes', 'government', 'level', 'plausible', 'even', 'true', 'Sedate', 'bit', 'dated', 'compared', 'extreme', 'tempo', 'Bourne', 'series', 'IMHO', 'Bourne', 'series', 'extreme', 'too', 'much', 'maybe']",No Way Out / Company Business

I had to watch the movie twice to figure out how some of the actions tied together.  Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman work well together and create a very enjoyable movie.  The supporting actors are also very good in their roles.  The movie is violent but does not show a lot of the graphic violence.  Due to the sexuality, I do not recommend for 14 and under.  Very good movie that leads in many directions and are never quite sure what will happen.",5,Awesome movie,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,538,"['like', 'movies', 'subplots', 'suspense', 'twists', 'turns', 'Way', 'Out', 'had', 'watch', 'movie', 'twice', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'actions', 'tied', 'together', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'create', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'movie', 'violent', 'not', 'show', 'lot', 'graphic', 'violence', 'Due', 'sexuality', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', '14', 'Very', 'good', 'movie', 'many', 'directions', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'will', 'happen']",No Way Out / Company Business
