221467,AQUU8S55JGY2H,6300216454,Aco,"[3, 4]","In keeping with my awesome love for the 1970's era of American film, Save the Tiger delves into the anxiety of the time as experienced by a man waring down and disillusioned. Much, much, much respect to Jack Lemmon as Harry Stoner. There are no less than half-a-dozen scenes of considerable tonal/emotional difference in which he is palpably fabulous, so moving and edgy. He truly is throughout though. His Oscar is well deserved for this film, much less an awesome career that by then was 20+ years full of terrific work.Jack Gilford's Phil Greene, is Lemmon's business partner-a man morally anchored and disassociated from the weight of Stoner's tumultuous anxiety. His performance is equally compassionate, true and grounded. The relationship between them-Eastwood + Morgan Freeman in Million Dollar Baby comes to mind-as old friends, partners and confidants, is beautiful.""It costs me $200 just getting out of bed,"" (a paraphrase) Stoner says to his wife, while preparing for the day, this after waking up after another nightmare. And through the day his life and mind become intermingled with the dread and uncertainty of getting by. No answer is clear, or convenient. In a fickle yet brutal world, there is no rest for the weary.Save the Tiger is not a direct indictment of business or success in America. Nor is it morally weighted. Like so many other films of the time, it is a unflinching/raw/honest character study of an everyman in the mix, troubled by bills, taxes, the past and the future. It is also a rendering of what post-traumatic-stress/war can do, irrespective of time, to the mind and heart of a person. The touch of WWII adds a gravity and understanding to the film.I highly recommend Save the Tiger. Not too long, interesting, and full of great acting, especially from Jack Lemmon.",4,We only have 556 signatures.,1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,1804,"['keeping', 'awesome', 'love', '1970', 'era', 'American', 'film', 'Save', 'Tiger', 'anxiety', 'time', 'experienced', 'man', 'waring', 'down', 'disillusioned', 'Much', 'much', 'much', 'respect', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Harry', 'Stoner', 'are', 'less', 'half-a-dozen', 'scenes', 'considerable', 'tonal/emotional', 'difference', 'palpably', 'fabulous', 'moving', 'edgy', 'truly', 'Oscar', 'well', 'deserved', 'film', 'much', 'less', 'awesome', 'career', 'then', 'was', '20+', 'years', 'full', 'terrific', 'work.Jack', 'Gilford', 'Phil', 'Greene', 'Lemmon', 'business', 'partner-a', 'man', 'morally', 'anchored', 'disassociated', 'weight', 'Stoner', 'tumultuous', 'anxiety', 'performance', 'equally', 'compassionate', 'true', 'grounded', 'relationship', 'them-Eastwood', '+', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'mind-as', 'old', 'friends', 'partners', 'confidants', 'beautiful', '200', 'just', 'getting', 'bed', 'paraphrase', 'Stoner', 'wife', 'preparing', 'day', 'waking', 'up', 'nightmare', 'day', 'life', 'mind', 'become', 'intermingled', 'dread', 'uncertainty', 'getting', 'answer', 'clear', 'convenient', 'fickle', 'yet', 'brutal', 'world', 'rest', 'weary.Save', 'Tiger', 'not', 'direct', 'indictment', 'business', 'success', 'America', 'morally', 'weighted', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'time', 'unflinching/raw/honest', 'character', 'study', 'everyman', 'mix', 'troubled', 'bills', 'taxes', 'past', 'future', 'also', 'rendering', 'what', 'post-traumatic-stress/war', 'can', 'do', 'irrespective', 'time', 'mind', 'heart', 'person', 'touch', 'WWII', 'gravity', 'understanding', 'film.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Save', 'Tiger', 'Not', 'too', 'long', 'interesting', 'full', 'great', 'acting', 'especially', 'Jack', 'Lemmon']",Save the Tiger VHS
221468,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300216454,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","Jack Lemmon was in all seriousness one of the greatest actors to ever walk the earth.  His comedic skills are unprecedented, but he also had a wonderful way of using his humor to enrich his dramatic offerings.  Just look at `The Apartment', a dramedy that is elevated by the rich performance by Lemmon.  Look also at the beautifully constructed `Short Cuts' where Lemmon uses his mastery over his profession to create a man so raw and real, so heartbreakingly sincere.His portrayal of Harry Stoner, the middle-aged business man suffering from his own professional and personal meltdowns, is yet another outstanding professional feat for the actor.`Save the Tiger' is a very strong film that paints a very real portrait of that mid-life crisis we hear so much about.  While watching this film I couldn't help but recall Kevin Spacey's Oscar acceptance speech in 1999 when he won for his portrayal of Lester Burnham, the middle-aged business man suffering from professional and personal meltdowns in `American Beauty'.  Both performances are very similar and are equally engaging and impressive.  Both Harry and Lester offer a poignant look at the male psyche and the affect our surroundings have on us.Here, Harry is head of a garment factory which is suffering in sales and is bordering bankruptcy.  Harry and his more ethically sound partner Phil Greene start contemplating ways to fix their financial crisis and wind up settling on arson, although neither are in full agreement.  The decision seems to be the only way out, but it's yet another issue to weigh heavy on the already haunted Harry, leading him to question everything he knows over the course of two days.Those two days are enough to understand completely.Both Lemmon and Gilford (who plays Phil) were nominated for an Oscar, Lemmon being the only winner of the two.  These are two very rich and fulfilled performances and were both very worthy of their nominations, even if I would have handed Brando the Oscar for his riveting performance in `Last Tango in Paris'.  Lemmon serves up some of his finest work here and I am very glad to see he won a lead actor trophy.`Save the Tiger' is a startling look at the American Dream and the sacrifices we make to achieve it; but most importantly it reminds us of the bitter consequences that comes from those sacrifices.  There are quite a few films that tackle this subject, some of which do a finer job (I personally prefer `American Beauty') but this is truly at the top of the list as one of the better films to broach the subject.It always haunting to find yourself in a character as distraught as Harry Stoner.",5,These subtleties will beat you over the head...,1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,2623,"['Jack', 'Lemmon', 'was', 'seriousness', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'ever', 'walk', 'earth', 'comedic', 'skills', 'are', 'unprecedented', 'also', 'had', 'wonderful', 'way', 'using', 'humor', 'enrich', 'dramatic', 'offerings', 'Just', 'look', 'Apartment', 'dramedy', 'elevated', 'rich', 'performance', 'Lemmon', 'Look', 'also', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'where', 'Lemmon', 'mastery', 'profession', 'create', 'man', 'raw', 'real', 'so', 'heartbreakingly', 'sincere.His', 'portrayal', 'Harry', 'Stoner', 'middle-aged', 'business', 'man', 'suffering', 'own', 'professional', 'personal', 'meltdowns', 'yet', 'outstanding', 'professional', 'feat', 'actor.', 'Save', 'Tiger', 'very', 'strong', 'film', 'very', 'real', 'portrait', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'hear', 'so', 'much', 'watching', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'recall', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Oscar', 'acceptance', 'speech', '1999', 'when', 'won', 'portrayal', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'middle-aged', 'business', 'man', 'suffering', 'professional', 'personal', 'meltdowns', 'American', 'Beauty', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'are', 'equally', 'engaging', 'impressive', 'Harry', 'Lester', 'offer', 'poignant', 'look', 'male', 'psyche', 'affect', 'surroundings', 'have', 'us.Here', 'Harry', 'head', 'garment', 'factory', 'suffering', 'sales', 'bordering', 'bankruptcy', 'Harry', 'more', 'ethically', 'sound', 'partner', 'Phil', 'Greene', 'start', 'contemplating', 'ways', 'fix', 'financial', 'crisis', 'wind', 'up', 'settling', 'arson', 'are', 'full', 'agreement', 'decision', 'be', 'only', 'way', 'yet', 'issue', 'weigh', 'heavy', 'already', 'haunted', 'Harry', 'leading', 'question', 'everything', 'course', 'two', 'days.Those', 'two', 'days', 'are', 'enough', 'understand', 'completely.Both', 'Lemmon', 'Gilford', 'who', 'Phil', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Lemmon', 'being', 'only', 'winner', 'two', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'rich', 'fulfilled', 'performances', 'were', 'very', 'worthy', 'nominations', 'even', 'would', 'have', 'handed', 'Brando', 'Oscar', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'Lemmon', 'up', 'finest', 'work', 'here', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'see', 'won', 'lead', 'actor', 'trophy.', 'Save', 'Tiger', 'startling', 'look', 'American', 'Dream', 'sacrifices', 'make', 'achieve', 'most', 'importantly', 'bitter', 'consequences', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'films', 'tackle', 'subject', 'do', 'finer', 'job', 'personally', 'prefer', 'American', 'Beauty', 'truly', 'top', 'list', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'broach', 'subject.It', 'always', 'haunting', 'find', 'character', 'as', 'distraught', 'Harry', 'Stoner']",Save the Tiger VHS
221469,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6300216454,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Fashion manufacturer Harry Stoner (Oscar winner Jack Lemmon) is a man filled with regrets: for things he should've done (like play baseball or stay in a band) and for those he actually did (go to war). His marriage to Janet (Patricia Smith) is chilly-- during most of the picture she's out of town. The business is tottering toward bankruptcy, his health isn't great, employees fight with each other and a fashion show that could make or break him is imminent-- yet with all these pressing immediacies Harry's lost in and tortured by the past, especially by horrific memories of the WWII Italian Campaign.The bank won't extend Harry credit and not wanting to borrow from a mob loan shark he instead contacts arsonist Charlie Robbins (Thayer David) and arranges the torching of one of his factories as a way to collect on insurance. Harry's partner of 15 years, Phil Greene (Jack Gilford) is appalled that Stoner would resort to this illegal act, but Harry's determined to stay afloat no matter what it takes.While driving on Sunset Strip, Harry picks up Myra (Laurie Heineman) a hippieish hitchhiker. Their conversation illustrates the enormity of the chasm between generations. Eventually this girl his daughter's age asks Harry if he'd like to ""ball"" but he declines with an amused chuckle. You just know however that this matter isn't settled.After meeting with and giving a down payment to the firebug, Harry speaks at the fashion show's opening. He fumbles, mumbles, sweats and stops dead, because in his mind the audience has turned into ghastly soldier demons. The show's theme is the Isle of Capri, and when Harry says the name he totally flips and starts ranting about dead soldiers on Capri's beach. The female emcee stops Harry's bizarre outburst by cutting him off.Back at the factory, Harry shares a drink with an elderly fabric cutter-- the man who's been feuding with his ""fairy"" designer. The old Russan Jew immigrant talks about passion for work and for a wife who's old but still beautiful. As a result, Harry leaves and calls Janet to try connecting with her by reminiscing about their two weeks of heavy romance on the Riviera. Janet dismisses the memories curtly with ""that was six years ago!"" and shaken, she hangs up.More failure for Mr. Stoner.Later that night, Harry spots Myra (sure enough) and picks her up. She invites him to smoke some good grass at a beach house she's taking care of. They party and they ""ball""-- we don't see that thankfully, and afterward while they talk Harry trips out on the past again, remembering dozens of famous folks.In the movie's final scene, Harry tosses a baseball back to some kids playing a game. He leans on the outfield fence and goes off on another memory ride-- probably to childhood when he dreamed of being a big league pitcher.Jack Lemmon undoubtedly clinched the Oscar when he lay in bed with Myra and with watery eyes talked longingly of better days and a lost youth. It's a moment that touches the soul.",5,Save Harry Stoner,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,2976,"['Fashion', 'manufacturer', 'Harry', 'Stoner', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'man', 'filled', 'regrets', 'things', 'should', ""'ve"", 'done', 'play', 'baseball', 'stay', 'band', 'actually', 'did', 'go', 'war', 'marriage', 'Janet', 'Patricia', 'Smith', 'chilly', 'most', 'picture', 'town', 'business', 'tottering', 'bankruptcy', 'health', ""n't"", 'great', 'employees', 'fight', 'other', 'fashion', 'show', 'could', 'make', 'break', 'imminent', 'yet', 'pressing', 'immediacies', 'Harry', 'lost', 'tortured', 'past', 'especially', 'horrific', 'memories', 'WWII', 'Italian', 'Campaign.The', 'bank', 'wo', ""n't"", 'extend', 'Harry', 'credit', 'not', 'wanting', 'borrow', 'mob', 'loan', 'shark', 'instead', 'arsonist', 'Charlie', 'Robbins', 'Thayer', 'David', 'torching', 'one', 'factories', 'way', 'collect', 'insurance', 'Harry', 'partner', '15', 'years', 'Phil', 'Greene', 'Jack', 'Gilford', 'appalled', 'Stoner', 'would', 'resort', 'illegal', 'act', 'Harry', 'determined', 'stay', 'afloat', 'matter', 'what', 'takes.While', 'driving', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'Harry', 'up', 'Myra', 'Laurie', 'Heineman', 'hippieish', 'hitchhiker', 'conversation', 'enormity', 'chasm', 'generations', 'Eventually', 'daughter', 'age', 'Harry', ""'d"", 'like', 'ball', 'amused', 'chuckle', 'just', 'know', 'however', 'matter', ""n't"", 'settled.After', 'meeting', 'giving', 'down', 'payment', 'firebug', 'Harry', 'fashion', 'show', 'opening', 'mumbles', 'sweats', 'stops', 'dead', 'mind', 'audience', 'turned', 'ghastly', 'soldier', 'demons', 'show', 'theme', 'Isle', 'Capri', 'when', 'Harry', 'name', 'totally', 'ranting', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'Capri', 'beach', 'female', 'emcee', 'Harry', 'bizarre', 'outburst', 'cutting', 'off.Back', 'factory', 'Harry', 'shares', 'drink', 'elderly', 'fabric', 'cutter', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'feuding', 'fairy', 'designer', 'old', 'Russan', 'Jew', 'immigrant', 'talks', 'passion', 'work', 'wife', 'who', 'old', 'still', 'beautiful', 'result', 'Harry', 'Janet', 'try', 'connecting', 'reminiscing', 'two', 'weeks', 'heavy', 'romance', 'Riviera', 'Janet', 'memories', 'curtly', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'ago', 'shaken', 'up.More', 'failure', 'Mr.', 'Stoner.Later', 'night', 'Harry', 'Myra', 'sure', 'enough', 'up', 'smoke', 'good', 'grass', 'beach', 'house', 'taking', 'care', 'party', 'ball', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'thankfully', 'afterward', 'talk', 'Harry', 'out', 'past', 'again', 'remembering', 'dozens', 'famous', 'folks.In', 'movie', 'final', 'scene', 'Harry', 'baseball', 'back', 'kids', 'playing', 'game', 'outfield', 'fence', 'off', 'memory', 'ride', 'probably', 'childhood', 'when', 'dreamed', 'being', 'big', 'league', 'pitcher.Jack', 'Lemmon', 'undoubtedly', 'clinched', 'Oscar', 'when', 'lay', 'bed', 'Myra', 'watery', 'eyes', 'talked', 'longingly', 'better', 'days', 'lost', 'youth', 'moment', 'soul']",Save the Tiger VHS
221470,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,6300216454,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[5, 5]","Director John Avildsen created a bleak, grey feeling for his movie set (as well as made) in the early 70s, a time of transition in this country in many ways. The 70s was really the last decade where we were still fully recognized as more of an industrial economy, before the 80s and years to follow changed that in many ways. The textile industry was not exempt from people continuing to go through their normal factory job routines, but with less than optomistic visions of the future. I vividly rememberr men just like Jack Lemon's Harry Stoner character in ""Save The Tiger""- guys who looked like they were going through the routines of their jobs though the future looks bleak, and not really knowing where else to turn to. Lemon's fifty-ish character is an anachronism, lost in current times, not understanding why contemporaries can't relate to things he talks about, and still haunted by the past, particularly his war involvement and all the war implied. A feeling of despair permeates through this movie, and the combination of Lemon's performance and Avildsen's pacing and location selections, even today, still captures the feel of many cities in the early 70s that seemed hollow though one time fully viable. And the early 70s era of Watergate and Viet Nam that left many with a ""where do we turn to"" mentality didn't escape Lemon and his partner (Jack Gilford), particularly Lemon who can't escape a mindset of how much better things were in the past. This isn't a fast paced movie by any stretch. It's not the type of movie that will garner a young audience today, especially with subject matter that would test anyone's cultural literacy. And frankly, those who lived in the 70s may actually appreciate the mood created by Avildsen more than those who did not. Which isn't to say this movie can't be appreciated otherwise. In fact, you'd miss Jack Lemon's last great performance if you don't see this movie. I saw this movie pretty young- Jr. High I believe- and though I didn't fully understand it, I definitely felt and appreciated it. Years later I found it even more compelling given a better understanding of names and places Lemon refers to when flashing back to the past. With recent DVD release and more viewings on the premium movie channels, I liked it even more when seeing it again. A very well kept secret of the 70s.",4,Outstanding. Great performances.

The women in the movie are all more or less victims and are there to provide to the sense of moral decay in the movie.  Not necessarily because they themselves are corrupt, but because they are consumed by the appetites of the men in the movie.It is hard to capture the sense of America in 1973.  Vietnam was in its death throes, the sexual revolution and drug culture were in full swing (hence all the casual promiscuity in the film), the schismatic rage over the Equal Rights Amendment was underway, Roe v. Wade was pushed on the country, Watergate was underway as were other corruption charges in the Nixon administration, and women were beginning to enter the workforce in large numbers.Lemmon plays Harry Stoner.  He is clearly suffering from what we would now call Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, but that wasn't really known at the time of this movie or was just beginning to be discussed because of Vietnam.  Stoner is a World War II vet.  He is unsuccessful in developing personal relationships because he deals with his pain by focusing on numbing it through work, through gratification of his sexual appetites, and fleeing intimacy.  He dwells on his war experiences and is on the verge of a crackup.His business is also about ready to fail because of bad finances.  How much of his stress is caused by the business pressures or whether the business situation is caused by his narcissistic way of living is hard to distinguish.  However, his partner, Phil Greene (the wonderful Jack Gilford) is caught up in this mess.  They are coming out with a great new line they both believe in, but the bank won't give them any more money.  So, do they get it from mob or do they burn some insured building down and use the proceeds from the policy.  Phil doesn't want to commit any crimes and is the voice of the old morality in the movie.  Still, he doesn't fight Stoner too hard.The whole movie takes place in less than two days and in the end doesn't resolve the issues it raises.  We get the problems raised, given a tour of what is eating at Stoner, and left to ourselves to decide what it all means and guess as to how it comes out.  This was more fashionable in those days than today.  It was somehow supposed to be more sophisticated.  Maybe it just avoiding writing a satisfying ending that would be difficult to pull off was the real point.I am now the age of Stoner's character and find him to be selfish, self-destructive, and do not believe that his war experiences justify what he setting about doing.  Life has a way of pounding pretty much everyone who gets to their fifties.  Most do not do the things he resorts to and the behavior he justifies.  He sees others more as a means than ends in themselves, and there is the beginning of his moral dilemma.Lemmon does a fine job with the character as do the other actors, but it is 70s fashionably bleak.  So, it is up to you whether you think it will wear well for you.",4,Fine acting in a rather bleak story - fashionable for its time,1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,3224,"['Jack', 'Lemmon', 'won', 'Oscar', '1973', 'performance', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Gilford', 'was', 'nominated', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'writing', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Theyer', 'David', 'great', 'impression', 'professional', 'arsonist', 'Charlie', 'Robbins', 'as', 'well', 'women', 'movie', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'victims', 'are', 'there', 'provide', 'sense', 'moral', 'decay', 'movie', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'are', 'corrupt', 'are', 'consumed', 'appetites', 'men', 'movie.It', 'hard', 'capture', 'sense', 'America', '1973', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'death', 'throes', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'drug', 'culture', 'were', 'full', 'swing', 'hence', 'casual', 'promiscuity', 'film', 'schismatic', 'rage', 'Equal', 'Rights', 'Amendment', 'was', 'underway', 'Roe', 'v.', 'Wade', 'was', 'pushed', 'country', 'Watergate', 'was', 'underway', 'were', 'other', 'corruption', 'charges', 'Nixon', 'administration', 'women', 'were', 'beginning', 'enter', 'workforce', 'large', 'numbers.Lemmon', 'plays', 'Harry', 'Stoner', 'clearly', 'suffering', 'what', 'would', 'now', 'call', 'Post', 'Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Disorder', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'known', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'be', 'discussed', 'Vietnam', 'Stoner', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'vet', 'unsuccessful', 'developing', 'personal', 'relationships', 'pain', 'focusing', 'numbing', 'work', 'gratification', 'sexual', 'appetites', 'fleeing', 'intimacy', 'war', 'experiences', 'verge', 'crackup.His', 'business', 'also', 'about', 'ready', 'fail', 'bad', 'finances', 'How', 'much', 'stress', 'caused', 'business', 'pressures', 'business', 'situation', 'caused', 'narcissistic', 'way', 'living', 'hard', 'distinguish', 'However', 'partner', 'Phil', 'Greene', 'wonderful', 'Jack', 'Gilford', 'caught', 'up', 'mess', 'are', 'coming', 'out', 'great', 'new', 'line', 'believe', 'bank', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', 'money', 'So', 'do', 'get', 'mob', 'do', 'burn', 'insured', 'building', 'down', 'use', 'proceeds', 'policy', 'Phil', ""n't"", 'want', 'commit', 'crimes', 'voice', 'old', 'morality', 'movie', 'Still', ""n't"", 'fight', 'Stoner', 'too', 'hard.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'place', 'less', 'two', 'days', 'end', ""n't"", 'resolve', 'issues', 'get', 'problems', 'raised', 'given', 'tour', 'what', 'eating', 'Stoner', 'left', 'ourselves', 'decide', 'what', 'means', 'guess', 'how', 'out', 'was', 'more', 'fashionable', 'days', 'today', 'was', 'somehow', 'supposed', 'be', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'Maybe', 'just', 'avoiding', 'writing', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'pull', 'off', 'was', 'real', 'point.I', 'am', 'now', 'age', 'Stoner', 'character', 'find', 'be', 'selfish', 'self-destructive', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'war', 'experiences', 'justify', 'what', 'setting', 'doing', 'Life', 'way', 'pounding', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'who', 'fifties', 'Most', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'things', 'behavior', 'others', 'more', 'means', 'ends', 'beginning', 'moral', 'dilemma.Lemmon', 'fine', 'job', 'character', 'do', 'other', 'actors', '70s', 'fashionably', 'bleak', 'So', 'up', 'think', 'will', 'wear', 'well']",Save the Tiger VHS

221479,A2CS77CAOHQV02,6300216454,Don E. Marchione,"[2, 2]","I recall seeing this movie when it was released and remember much of it quite well.  Jack Lemmon is perfect as garment manufacturer, Harry Stoner, who lives in Beverly Hills and is facing severe financial difficulties in his business.  His business partner, a very ethical and industrious man, is played by Jack Gilford, whose performance could not have been better.  The movie reveals that Harry Stoner is troubled by memories of World War II combat in Italy.  He is still feeling the pain and remembers the bloodshed.  But he has other memories, especially of the days when Joe Dimaggio was with the Yankees and Cookie Lavagetto played for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  The importance of baseball is in the recollection of a time of innocense and values.It is clear in the movie that Harry Stoner is not living within the orbit of that which he knows is ethical.  He is willing to arrange a customer meeting with a prostitute (played by Lara Parker [Angelique of Dark Shadows]) in order to keep his business as a buyer.  This is something that he has done for the customer in the past.  So, we know that he is willing to sacrifice values for financial reasons.  When his business descends to a severe financial crisis, he wants to enlist the services of an arsonist (Thayer David [Ben Stokes of Dark Shadows]) to collect the insurance money.  He is living well and the Jack Gilford character tells him, very forcefully, that Stoner does not need to live in Beverly Hills and that he will not condone any arrangement involving criminal behaviour.So, there is a clear conflict because Stoner's memories of the innocense of youth are in vivid contrast to the practices he has been willing to pursue to live well.  That which he knows is true and decent has become like an endangered species in his life.  Hence, Save The Tiger.  In the end, he visits a baseball field where kids are playing their game.  He sees the innocense that he has abandoned for the sake of a better financial life.  One questions whether his values will change.  This seems to be left unanswered but the viewer knows that Stoner does not have an evil soul.  He recognizes good and wants it back.  He has been very weak, ethically.  Yet, there may be hope for him.  He is not Gordon Gekko, who was unequivocal in his greed and lust for power, irrespective of the cost to others.The film delivers an unambiguous, timeless,  message about the choice between a clear conscience and the quest for success. The protagonist is paying a steep emotional price.

Apparently someone changed the rules along the way. He fought for his country in Italy and saw men die on the beaches and is haunted by it. What the heck went wrong? It's surely not like baseball where the rules never change. Harry's got everything but happiness. In fact, the only one in the movie who is happy is Myra, the cute, carefree chick, who at 21, is without responsibilities and has nothing better to do than hang out on the Strip every day looking for someone to ball. As Harry leaves the beach house after shacking up for the night with Myra, who says goodbye with ""have a great day,"" it seems he wants to tell her, ""Baby, wait till you grow up.""Desperation pervades the film. Even two employees in the factory, Meyer and Rico, like their craft but can't seem to get along with each other. And customers can count on Harry to supply a broad and hotel room when they arrived for a show. This time the favor goes all wrong as Harry's customer is rewarded with a heart attack. Ultimately, Harry has a nervous breakdown while giving a speech to the buyers, as he can't get the war and the men in Company C out of his mind. In the end we see Harry slumped over a sandlot fence watching a game he could always count on for stability and one that has no lethal consequences.

221483,A2Y4AHQ69FW6SC,6300216454,"Joseph Deprospero ""Joedb3""","[1, 2]","How this film is still generally well-regarded is beyond me. The dialogue reeks of ""70's hip talk"" - the bedroom scene at the film's beginning between Jack Lemmon and his wife (""I wish we would've made it last night"") sets the tone as Lemmon's melancholia is foisted upon the viewer. His recitation of the starting lineup of the old Brooklyn Dodgers is used as a metaphor to reflect Lemmon's yearning for the ""good old days"" and is replete with Lemmon firing a make-believe fastball.Strike One.Listen to the conversation with his wife in this scene. It just is not the way people converse with each other. Rather it is simply a means of teeing up the film's almost endless series of self-indulgent and unrealistic scenes of conflict. By the way, his wife's dialogue is extremely annoying (""SEE DOCTOR FRANKFURTER!""). Fortunately she disappears after this scene.The film's major characters are all cardboard cutouts. Characterizations seem to be in pairs, simply for the purpose of creating conflict. Lemmon's relationship with his wife; the Lemmon / Jack Gilford arguments for/against torching the business for insurance; the young and arrogant designer against the old world-weary dressmaker (""Harry, we need to TALK!""). Lemmon even gets an attitude from the parking lot attendant! Not a shred of credibility in any of these characters - they simply mouth dialogue intended to advance the film's overbearing message of conflict.Strike Two.Lemmon's breakdown during a speech to buyers and potential customers for his garment business is embarrassing to watch and simply not believable.And what would a hip film from the 70's be without a doe-eyed young lady with rather liberal views on sex? Lemmon picks up a pretty young hitchhiker who passes her time thumbing rides along the boulevard with no particular place to go (I should live so long). In true 70's fashion they end up in bed where Lemmon seems to suffer some sort of nervous attack (calling Dr. Frankfurter!). His bedmate's attempt to ""bring him down"" is incredulous. Can't this guy lose it in the privacy of his own home for once? What foolishness.Lemmon also has a sideline as a pimp for a pathetically sex-starved high end customer who inconveniently drops dead during an assignation with a prostitute Lemmon has procured for him. Amidst all the business-related crisis of book-cooking and potential arson Lemmon needs to deal with this. I guess when it goes bad it goes bad.Strike Three.I do recall the film being taken very seriously at the time (remember, this is the same public that bought Melanie's records). Lemmon was on one of those afternoon talk shows plugging the film shortly after its release. During the interview he mentioned that he suffered from depression throughout the filming, presumably due to the character he was playing. Perhaps this is the one nugget of credibility that emerged from this pretentious, self-indulgent film, although his depression would have been better justified after the film's release.",1,Self-indulgent relic from the 70's,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,2995,"['How', 'film', 'still', 'generally', 'well-regarded', 'dialogue', 'reeks', '70', 'hip', 'talk', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'film', 'beginning', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'wife', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'last', 'night', 'tone', 'Lemmon', 'melancholia', 'foisted', 'viewer', 'recitation', 'starting', 'lineup', 'old', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodgers', 'used', 'metaphor', 'reflect', 'Lemmon', 'yearning', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'replete', 'Lemmon', 'firing', 'make-believe', 'fastball.Strike', 'One.Listen', 'conversation', 'wife', 'scene', 'just', 'not', 'way', 'people', 'converse', 'other', 'simply', 'means', 'teeing', 'up', 'film', 'almost', 'endless', 'series', 'self-indulgent', 'unrealistic', 'scenes', 'conflict', 'way', 'wife', 'dialogue', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'SEE', 'DOCTOR', 'FRANKFURTER', 'Fortunately', 'scene.The', 'film', 'major', 'characters', 'are', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'Characterizations', 'seem', 'be', 'pairs', 'simply', 'purpose', 'creating', 'conflict', 'Lemmon', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Lemmon', '/', 'Jack', 'Gilford', 'for/against', 'torching', 'business', 'insurance', 'young', 'arrogant', 'designer', 'old', 'world-weary', 'dressmaker', 'Harry', 'need', 'TALK', 'Lemmon', 'even', 'attitude', 'parking', 'lot', 'attendant', 'Not', 'shred', 'credibility', 'characters', 'simply', 'mouth', 'dialogue', 'intended', 'advance', 'film', 'overbearing', 'message', 'conflict.Strike', 'Two.Lemmon', 'breakdown', 'speech', 'buyers', 'potential', 'customers', 'garment', 'business', 'embarrassing', 'watch', 'simply', 'not', 'believable.And', 'what', 'would', 'hip', 'film', '70', 'be', 'doe-eyed', 'young', 'lady', 'rather', 'liberal', 'views', 'sex', 'Lemmon', 'up', 'pretty', 'young', 'hitchhiker', 'who', 'time', 'thumbing', 'rides', 'boulevard', 'particular', 'place', 'go', 'should', 'live', 'so', 'long', 'true', '70', 'fashion', 'end', 'up', 'bed', 'where', 'Lemmon', 'suffer', 'sort', 'nervous', 'attack', 'calling', 'Dr', 'Frankfurter', 'bedmate', 'attempt', 'bring', 'down', 'incredulous', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'guy', 'lose', 'privacy', 'own', 'home', 'once', 'What', 'foolishness.Lemmon', 'also', 'sideline', 'pimp', 'pathetically', 'sex-starved', 'high', 'end', 'customer', 'who', 'inconveniently', 'dead', 'assignation', 'prostitute', 'Lemmon', 'procured', 'Amidst', 'business-related', 'crisis', 'book-cooking', 'potential', 'arson', 'Lemmon', 'deal', 'guess', 'when', 'bad', 'Three.I', 'do', 'recall', 'film', 'being', 'taken', 'very', 'seriously', 'time', 'remember', 'same', 'public', 'bought', 'Melanie', 'records', 'Lemmon', 'was', 'one', 'afternoon', 'talk', 'plugging', 'film', 'shortly', 'release', 'interview', 'mentioned', 'suffered', 'depression', 'filming', 'presumably', 'due', 'character', 'was', 'playing', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'nugget', 'credibility', 'emerged', 'pretentious', 'self-indulgent', 'film', 'depression', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'justified', 'film', 'release']",Save the Tiger VHS

NO NOMINATIONS.  Not one, not even for Best Hats.  The sterile, predictable costume piece, The Sting, racked up most of the Oscars that year.  Save the Tiger was sparsely nominated.  Lemmon for best actor, and Shagan, who wrote the novel and the screenplay (and produced), was deservedly nominated for best script.  Save the Tiger is a powerful, well-crafted film built around the compromises a man makes for wealth.  There are some haunting scenes as Lemmon's character tries to give a thank you speech and keeps seeing the faces of dead Vietnam vets in the audience.  The message here is that behind every great success story is a crime.  The seventies was a cynical decade, but there were a lot more real treatments of real human lives.  With the corporations and their focus groups funding more and more movie production these days we don't get many movies made about people anymore.

California garment manufacturer..His business is in trouble,he seems to be on the verge of a nervous break down one moment and his usual shifty self the next..He wants to pay an arsonist to burn down one of his buildings,much to the horror of his partner,played by comic Jack Gilford..Already undiscovered white collar criminals for cooking the books the previous season these two gonefs are what passes for the leading charecters in this rather slow,rather meandering film...The movie is filled with cliches that were standard fare back during the time-period when it was made;the 20-something flower child who picks up Stoner,sleeps with him,gets him high,and doesn't want a thing in return,and the call girl with the proverbial heart of gold,whom Stoner uses to satisfy visiting buyers..The getting high scene is a laugh riot..Stoner demands that he and the flower child""play a game""..the""game"" has nothing to do with intimacy..instead Stoner wants to name names of famous people,none of whom the flower child knows..As mentioned,the scene is a laugh riot,except it wasn't supposed to be..it was supposed to be serious stuff..What doofus did they get to think up this scene?Surely the writer has never even been just a tad drunk,much less high?As for the title;about two thirds of the way through this plodding mess,and after Stoner nearly has his break-down in front of an audience of buyers come to see his new fashion line,he wanders out into the street...there he encounters a fellow seated at a card table with a poster of a tiger""Save The Tiger"" the guy says and stoner hands him a couple of dollars..THAT is the whole she-bang as far as the title is concerned..It makes about as much sense as if Stoner had bumped into Luke Skywalker and R2D2...In the end Stoner pays the arsonist to torch his building..He also wanders off to a little league game..All through the flic Stoner has been mumbling about baseball players and practicing a pitching wind up...At the little league game happenstance allows Stoner to actually make the pitch..It does not go over well with the kids,one of whom tells Stoner;""You can't play with us,mister""...End of film...The layers of pretense in this film could sink a battleship...A film about next to nothing...I am not sure who Lemmon was up against the year they awarded him the oscar for this role but surely those other actors

Yet appearances are deceiving.  His relationship with his wife is strained, his business is overextended and failing, and his reality is increasingly fractured by memories of his dead war buddies, the 1939 lineup of his treasured Dodgers, and glimpses of his idealistic youth, particularly his years playing baseball, drumming with a big band and listening to swing music.The counterculture and the decaying values of Vietnam-era America meet Harry Stoner's sliding immorality head-on, as Harry is faced continually with business decisions that weaken him morally and challenge him ethically, until his fragile efforts at holding it all together rip apart at the seams.Not only is Lemmon extraordinary, so is the supporting cast, including Jack Gilford as his business partner and moral counterweight and sweet Laurie Heineman as a hippie with a heart of gold.  The settings in Los Angeles, such as the garment district, Chinatown, Beverly Hills, and Malibu are exquisitely captured by John Avildsen.You'd have to fast-forward to Woody Allen's masterful Crimes and Misdemeanors to see as finely a tuned exploration of the pressures on a morally conflicted American businessman as delivered here.BTW, the new release (with commentary) adds dimension and weight to an already substantial film.

This brilliant, searing film follows Harry through 36 hours of an unrelenting descent into his personal Hell, where he's brought face to face with the emptiness of his life & the fading ghosts of his youthful dreams.If Henry Fonda was the ideal American Everyman, Jack Lemmon was surely the harried American Everyman. He fully deserved his Oscar for this role, a painfully naked performance of a man who believed in the American dream, who did his best to make it work, yet finds that he now has nothing real to grasp. It's an unsparing portrait of the middle-aged, middle class man at the end of his tether. There's no attempt to soften his ravaged soul ... and yet it's a sympathetic portrait, understanding if not entirely forgiving.In a quietly powerful scene, Harry finally gets around to talking with his cutter Meyer, an old man who has lived through pogroms, exile, countless losses & disappointments, but who still cherishes his life.  When Harry confesses that all he wants is one more season, Meyer asks sadly, ""Just survival? Don't you have any dreams?"" And we realize with Harry that all of his dreams are gone, turned into memories of a simpler, more golden past. He knows that he's lost something precious, and even recognizes his own complicity in that loss. Yet he doesn't know what he can do to save himself now.Although there's no mention of it on the DVD case, the DVD itself boasts an illuminating commentary track by the director & the writer/producer. This film was clearly a labor of love for all concerned, so much so that they worked without salary to get it made. Their passion for the material shows in every frame. And as the commentary makes clear, the material remains all too relevant today.The supporting cast is uniformly superb, from Jack Gilford as Harry's partner, to the dangerously gorgeous Lara Parker as the call girl Margo, to Thayer David's professional arsonist, and Laurie Heineman as the rootless but warm hippie girl who spends a few hours with Harry. But in the end, it's Jack Lemmon's show, and he delivers flawlessly. That final image of Harry watching the children play baseball, as Bunny Berigan plays ""I Can't Get Started,"" is haunting & heartrending. Most highly recommended!",5,"""He's not a man!
