1144902,A1RXJG34ZT3WWX,B0014158W4,"C. M Torres ""chator4""","[6, 11]","What this documentary shows is that Hillary Clinton is guilty of being party to illegal fundraising for her Senate campaign of 2000. It demonstrates that she has no problem with breaking campaign finance laws, if doing so benefits her, as long as the media doesn't find out about it, and she isn't held accountable. She's shown breaking campaign finance laws, lying about it, and attempting to cover it up. This makes her a weaker candidate on the campaign reform issue compared with either Mc Cain, or Obama. Although McCain is even now trying to break or bend the laws he once helped establish. None of this is surprising as the Clintons have a reputation for being relentless power grabbers. It's important to note that there is nothing partisan about this documentary, it is based on footage shot by a former Clinton fundraiser, who was used then tossed away like a piece of garbage when he became a political liability. It raised questions for me regarding Hillary's character, her inability to be truthful, and accountable for her actions, two traits i despise about our current president.",2,Hillary Exposed!,1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,1095,"['What', 'documentary', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'guilty', 'being', 'party', 'illegal', 'fundraising', 'Senate', 'campaign', '2000', 'problem', 'breaking', 'campaign', 'finance', 'laws', 'doing', 'so', 'benefits', 'as', 'long', 'media', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', ""n't"", 'held', 'accountable', 'shown', 'breaking', 'campaign', 'finance', 'laws', 'lying', 'attempting', 'cover', 'up', 'weaker', 'candidate', 'campaign', 'reform', 'issue', 'compared', 'Mc', 'Cain', 'Obama', 'McCain', 'even', 'now', 'trying', 'break', 'bend', 'laws', 'once', 'helped', 'establish', 'None', 'surprising', 'Clintons', 'have', 'reputation', 'being', 'relentless', 'power', 'grabbers', 'important', 'note', 'nothing', 'partisan', 'documentary', 'based', 'footage', 'shot', 'former', 'Clinton', 'fundraiser', 'who', 'was', 'used', 'then', 'tossed', 'away', 'piece', 'garbage', 'when', 'became', 'political', 'liability', 'raised', 'questions', 'regarding', 'Hillary', 'character', 'inability', 'be', 'truthful', 'accountable', 'actions', 'two', 'traits', 'i', 'despise', 'current', 'president']",Hillary Uncensored!

How can one man's story not be partisan?It does provide some interesting facts that suggests that Hillary may have violated campaign financing law. I just couldn't follow the entire trail due to either bad editing, or the director just wanted to make it as hard to follow as possible.Would I recommend this to my friends and family? Probably not, Hillary, and Bill are doing enough to destroy her campaign. I don't think this hard to follow documentary has much impact on that. Also by trying to pass this off as non-partisan, when you can clearly tell it's a partisan vendetta documentary makes all the claims suspect in my opinion.",2,Highly Partisan,1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,741,"['first', 'moment', 'documentary', 'try', 'tell', 'supposed', 'be', 'non-partisan', 'How', 'can', 'one', 'man', 'story', 'not', 'be', 'partisan', 'provide', 'interesting', 'facts', 'Hillary', 'may', 'have', 'violated', 'campaign', 'financing', 'law', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'follow', 'entire', 'trail', 'due', 'bad', 'editing', 'director', 'just', 'wanted', 'make', 'as', 'hard', 'follow', 'possible.Would', 'recommend', 'friends', 'family', 'Probably', 'not', 'Hillary', 'Bill', 'are', 'doing', 'enough', 'destroy', 'campaign', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'hard', 'follow', 'documentary', 'much', 'impact', 'Also', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'non-partisan', 'when', 'can', 'clearly', 'tell', 'partisan', 'vendetta', 'documentary', 'claims', 'suspect', 'opinion']",Hillary Uncensored!
