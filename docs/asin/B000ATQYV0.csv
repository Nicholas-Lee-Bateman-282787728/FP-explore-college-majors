I was disappointed to learn that not all the episodes were made available, but I greatly enjoyed the three episodes on the disc. Elfego Baca was an additional treat of classic entertainment. Yes sir, Disney used to do such a great job back in the early days! I highly recommend this set to all who love history, real American heroes, or just enjoy watching classic Disney shows.",5,"""Swamp Fox"" Great, ""Elfego Baca"" Added Bonus!",1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,574,"['had', 'idea', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'had', 'made', 'TV', 'show', 'Francis', 'Marion', '34', 'Swamp', 'Fox', '34', 'childhood', 'hero', 'so', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'discovered', 'was', 'DVD', 'just', 'had', 'get', 'was', 'disappointed', 'learn', 'not', 'episodes', 'were', 'made', 'available', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'episodes', 'disc', 'Elfego', 'Baca', 'was', 'additional', 'treat', 'classic', 'entertainment', 'Yes', 'sir', 'Disney', 'used', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'back', 'early', 'days', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'who', 'love', 'history', 'real', 'American', 'heroes', 'just', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'classic', 'Disney', 'shows']",Walt Disney Treasures - Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox - Legendary Heroes

I would have liked to have the complete ten episodes of Baca and eight episodes of Fox on DVD.This was not to be, for shame!However In this treasury edition of Baca and Fox. There are only three episodes each of the series. The Disney production  values being the way it and was, I will take the three of each episode and rate them high.These episodes hold up after yearsHowever Disney fans, lets put the Powers that be on notice... WE all want full sets of our classic Disney shows (like they did with the full season of Spin and Marty that was just released) or full series seasons like Zorro (hopefully coming soon-PLEASE!) .

933350,A1RI3XMZHQXPD2,B000ATQYV0,C. Taylor,"[10, 11]","We are all use to whole season box sets. The days when a tape or DVD would only include 2-4 episodes is long gone. And when a series only had about 8 hours then we expect to find the whole series on a single two disc set. That is why we find it peculiar that instead of releasing every ElFego Baca and/or Swamp Fox episode in one box set we get three episodes each. And not even in broadcast order, episodes are skipped.While this could mean that they are holding out so that they could release more episodes in future volumes, I have a feeling that these are the only existing complete episodes from the series.If you were to look back at the Davy Crockett set you would notice that some of the episodes had scenes that were in Black & White. There was a simple reason for this. Walt Disney knew that color television was just around the corner and decided to film his shows in color to be reused in future broadcasts. But that would only include the episodes themselves and the host segments, not the opening and closing credits that would never be reused. When the actual ABC episode was put together, the host segments and episode itself was transferred onto black & white film so that the finished packaged episode to be delivered to ABC would be in black & white. There would be no reason to send color episodes since color television did not exist yet, and color film stock was nearly four times more expensive than black & white film stock. The only complete episodes they would have had in their vaults would be black & white while the separate color host segments and Davy Crockett footage would be kept elsewhere. Later on when ""Disney's Wonderful World of Color"" was on the air the color footage would be reused. But since commercial breaks were much longer the complete episodes would have been edited shorter. This leaves the distinct possibility that either the Walt Disney company no longer has the original uncut Davy Crockett footage, or that there is something wrong with the film it is on and can no longer be used as film masters [ although could possibly be restored and transferred onto safety stock ], or for some reason is held in a film library that refuses to release them. And then there is the biggest possibility, that the tins containing the film are lost somewhere within the Disney library and it will take them years to track down every print and catalog every tin in their vault. What it looks like has happened is that some episodes are composites of the complete ABC shows and the shorter color NBC or later shows, possibly even footage from the Davy Crockett movie release.So perhaps they decided for future episode releases that they would not release episodes unless they could locate the complete color footage. If that is the case then they may have been sitting on the Baca and Fox episodes they have now for months, perhaps years, and finally decided to release what they had now.One solution would be to recolor the black & white footage, but this sort of restoration is very expensive, and the last thing they want to do is spend millions restoring these episodes to color only for someone else to find the missing original color footage. Another solution would be to do what was done with the Davy Crockett episode, to release them with some segments not in color. But, once again, what happens when someone finds the color footage? This was not much of a problem with the Davy Crockett episodes that could be re-released again once that footage is finally located. But the Baca and Fox episodes have limited appeal and probably will not be re-released again for a long long time, so if they are going to release them then they better get it right the first time.Should you buy this volume of Disney Treasures? It all depends on how much you want to own these episodes. They are pretty much the same quality and pacing of the Davy Crockett episodes, so if you liked them then you will like these as well.",4,Why it may have been incomplete.,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,3951,"['are', 'use', 'whole', 'season', 'box', 'sets', 'days', 'when', 'tape', 'DVD', 'would', 'only', 'include', '2-4', 'episodes', 'long', 'gone', 'when', 'series', 'only', 'had', '8', 'hours', 'then', 'expect', 'find', 'whole', 'series', 'single', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'why', 'find', 'instead', 'releasing', 'ElFego', 'Baca', 'and/or', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'episode', 'one', 'box', 'set', 'get', 'three', 'episodes', 'not', 'even', 'broadcast', 'order', 'episodes', 'are', 'skipped.While', 'could', 'mean', 'are', 'holding', 'out', 'so', 'could', 'release', 'more', 'episodes', 'future', 'volumes', 'have', 'feeling', 'are', 'only', 'existing', 'complete', 'episodes', 'series.If', 'were', 'look', 'back', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'set', 'would', 'notice', 'episodes', 'had', 'scenes', 'were', 'Black', 'White', 'was', 'simple', 'reason', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'knew', 'color', 'television', 'was', 'just', 'corner', 'decided', 'film', 'shows', 'color', 'be', 'reused', 'future', 'broadcasts', 'would', 'only', 'include', 'episodes', 'host', 'segments', 'not', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'reused', 'When', 'actual', 'ABC', 'episode', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'host', 'segments', 'episode', 'was', 'transferred', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'so', 'finished', 'packaged', 'episode', 'be', 'delivered', 'ABC', 'would', 'be', 'black', 'white', 'would', 'be', 'reason', 'send', 'color', 'episodes', 'color', 'television', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'yet', 'color', 'film', 'stock', 'was', 'nearly', 'four', 'times', 'more', 'expensive', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'stock', 'only', 'complete', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'vaults', 'would', 'be', 'black', 'white', 'separate', 'color', 'host', 'segments', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'footage', 'would', 'be', 'kept', 'elsewhere', 'Later', 'when', 'Disney', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Color', 'was', 'air', 'color', 'footage', 'would', 'be', 'reused', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'were', 'much', 'longer', 'complete', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'shorter', 'distinct', 'possibility', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'company', 'no', 'longer', 'original', 'uncut', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'footage', 'something', 'wrong', 'film', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'used', 'film', 'masters', '[', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'restored', 'transferred', 'safety', 'stock', ']', 'reason', 'held', 'film', 'library', 'release', 'then', 'biggest', 'possibility', 'tins', 'containing', 'film', 'are', 'lost', 'somewhere', 'Disney', 'library', 'will', 'take', 'years', 'track', 'down', 'print', 'catalog', 'tin', 'vault', 'What', 'happened', 'episodes', 'are', 'composites', 'complete', 'ABC', 'shows', 'shorter', 'color', 'NBC', 'later', 'shows', 'possibly', 'even', 'footage', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'movie', 'release.So', 'perhaps', 'decided', 'future', 'episode', 'releases', 'would', 'not', 'release', 'episodes', 'could', 'locate', 'complete', 'color', 'footage', 'case', 'then', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'sitting', 'Baca', 'Fox', 'episodes', 'have', 'now', 'months', 'perhaps', 'years', 'finally', 'decided', 'release', 'what', 'had', 'now.One', 'solution', 'would', 'be', 'recolor', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'sort', 'restoration', 'very', 'expensive', 'last', 'thing', 'want', 'do', 'spend', 'millions', 'restoring', 'episodes', 'color', 'only', 'someone', 'else', 'find', 'missing', 'original', 'color', 'footage', 'solution', 'would', 'be', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'episode', 'release', 'segments', 'not', 'color', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'when', 'someone', 'color', 'footage', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'problem', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'could', 'be', 're-released', 'again', 'footage', 'finally', 'located', 'Baca', 'Fox', 'episodes', 'have', 'limited', 'appeal', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'be', 're-released', 'again', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'so', 'are', 'going', 'release', 'then', 'better', 'get', 'right', 'first', 'time.Should', 'buy', 'volume', 'Disney', 'Treasures', 'how', 'much', 'want', 'own', 'episodes', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'quality', 'pacing', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'episodes', 'so', 'liked', 'then', 'will', 'like', 'well']",Walt Disney Treasures - Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox - Legendary Heroes

933352,A106YXO3EHVD3J,B000ATQYV0,"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[2, 2]","The final release of Wave 5 is another worthy release. Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox Legendary Heroes are two lesser known series from Walt Disney's TV show, but are just as entertaining as any of the more popular series from the era. Once again the episodes on this set have had a proper restoration done to them or they were stored with extreme care. The first three episodes from each show are included here and I know that is bound to disappoint fans of the two series. While it would have been a better idea to give each series their own complete release, this could still be redeemed by releasing a second set with the remaining episodes for each series on it..... ala volume two. This would probably increase the sales of the first release for sure. The good new is the episodes that are included look remarkably good for their age. Like I mentioned in another Treasures release The Mickey Mouse Club, I was never a big fan of the show growing up during the 60's, but looking back at it now, I find it charming and fun.The first disc includes the first 3 episodes of Elfego Baca which is a fast paced &#34;shoot em up&#34; western series starring Robert Loggia (Frank from Scarface). The Swamp Fox is located on disc 2, While I had never heard of either of these shows, I found them both fun to watch and full of 50's action. Each episode is shown in its entirety with the Walt Disney intro making the episodes clock in at approx. 52 minutes. The extras on the first disc include an interview with Robert Loggia and 3 stills galleries.The second disc holds 3 (why not 4 ?) episodes from The Swamp Fox which look as good as the episodes from Elfego Baca on disc one. There is a lot of griping about how neither show has its complete run on this set, but I think Disney was skeptical of the popularity of the two series. Like I mentioned earlier in my review, this could be redeemed by releasing a volume two with the remaining 3 Baca and 5 Fox episodes on it. I'm sure this is a big reason why this set hasn't sold out....maybe if enough fans call or write Disney, they will answer the request with the remaining episodes for both shows released. Both series' episodes are in color with the intros in black and white as the original openings in color are lost.While both shows deserve their own release, there is no reason to rate this Treasures installment with a low rating. If the set had sold out they might have release the rest, but with such an underwhelming response, I doubt they will ever finish either series on DVD. Considering this was a WDT set that I knew little about, I came out of it very happy with this release and can only hope they will release the remaining episodes of both shows to complete the series(wave 10 please!). The discs are houses in their usual tin case with a reproduction of Disney art, a booklet and the COA.******I CALLED DISNEY AND REQUESTED FOR THE REMAINING EPISODE TO BE RELEASED.

Elgego Baca was a former gunman who became a sheriff, and later a lawyer. The Disney westerns tended to be out-of-the-ordinary shows, which generally didn't follow the formula of other TV westerns of that time. This is high level entertainment if you are interested in the TV westerns of the late 1950s and early 1960s. I am not a western TV show fan, so I am not specifically interested in this series. I saw this series when it was shown on the Disney Channel, but it just didn't interest me. But I do recognize the quality for western TV show fans.The three Elfego Baca shows on this DVD set are:Show #1 of the series - Elfego Baca: Nine Lives of Elfego Baca. Elfego is deputized to catch a rampaging cowboy, but this leads to trouble with other cowboys in the area.Show #2 of the series - Four Down and Five Lives To Go. Elfego becomes sheriff and is able to convince most of the criminals to turn themselves in. He is badly injured trying to catch a murderer, and decides to study law instead of being a sheriff.Show #5 of the series - Attorney At Law. Elfego becomes a lawyer, and in his first case, he defends an accused thief, who has been framed.Swamp Fox was a series of 8 episodes shown on the Walt Disney Presents TV series 1959-1961. It told the story of the American Patriot Francis Marion (actor Leslie Nielsen), who fought the British during the Revolutionary War using unusual methods, such as guerilla attacks. Again, I saw this series when it was shown on the Disney Channel, but the Revolutionary War adventure just didn't appeal to me. It is a quality show and I'm sure anyone interested in such action adventures would enjoy it.The three shows of Swamp Fox on this DVD set are:Show #1 of the series - Birth of the Swamp Fox. Marion learns the British are about to attack Charleston, and he helps by leading the governor and his party safely out of the city. Eluding the British in the swamps, he works with a band of loyal colonists to save a group of captured patriots.Show #2 of the series - Brother Against Brother. Tories (British supporters) stge raids against their patriot neighbors. Marion plans to free a group of American prisoners when he learns the British are about to transfer them to another area.Show #3 of the series - Tory Vengeance. Marion's nephew, Gabe, joins the army, but he is captured, tortured, and eventually killed. Marion swears vengeance.Bonus materials on this DVD set are:An interview with Robert Loggia, the star of ""Elfego Baca"".A featurette that examines the origins of these historical figures and the story of their lives ""Tales Of Courage And Adventure"".Still frame galleries from these TV shows and ""more"".I do believe the shows are a bit dated, so I gave it 3 stars. But the production standards are high quality - 4 to 5 stars. I do not plan to buy this DVD set, but I feel anyone who enjoys such shows would be very happy with the set.",3,Excellent Entertainment If You Are Interested,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,3012,"['Elfego', 'Baca', 'was', 'series', '10', 'episodes', 'shown', 'part', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Presents', 'anthology', 'TV', 'series', '1958-1960', 'Elgego', 'Baca', 'was', 'former', 'gunman', 'who', 'became', 'sheriff', 'later', 'lawyer', 'Disney', 'westerns', 'tended', 'be', 'out-of-the-ordinary', 'shows', 'generally', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'formula', 'other', 'TV', 'westerns', 'time', 'high', 'level', 'entertainment', 'are', 'interested', 'TV', 'westerns', 'late', '1950s', 'early', '1960s', 'am', 'not', 'western', 'TV', 'show', 'fan', 'am', 'not', 'specifically', 'interested', 'series', 'saw', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'interest', 'do', 'recognize', 'quality', 'western', 'TV', 'show', 'fans.The', 'three', 'Elfego', 'Baca', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'Show', '1', 'series', 'Elfego', 'Baca', 'Nine', 'Elfego', 'Baca', 'Elfego', 'deputized', 'catch', 'rampaging', 'cowboy', 'trouble', 'other', 'cowboys', 'area.Show', '2', 'series', 'Four', 'Down', 'Five', 'Go', 'Elfego', 'sheriff', 'able', 'convince', 'most', 'criminals', 'turn', 'badly', 'injured', 'trying', 'catch', 'murderer', 'study', 'law', 'instead', 'being', 'sheriff.Show', '5', 'series', 'Attorney', 'Law', 'Elfego', 'lawyer', 'first', 'case', 'accused', 'thief', 'who', 'been', 'framed.Swamp', 'Fox', 'was', 'series', '8', 'episodes', 'shown', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Presents', 'TV', 'series', '1959-1961', 'told', 'story', 'American', 'Patriot', 'Francis', 'Marion', 'actor', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'who', 'fought', 'British', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'using', 'unusual', 'methods', 'such', 'guerilla', 'attacks', 'Again', 'saw', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'adventure', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'quality', 'show', ""'m"", 'sure', 'anyone', 'interested', 'such', 'action', 'adventures', 'would', 'enjoy', 'it.The', 'three', 'shows', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'Show', '1', 'series', 'Birth', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'Marion', 'British', 'are', 'attack', 'Charleston', 'leading', 'governor', 'party', 'safely', 'city', 'Eluding', 'British', 'swamps', 'band', 'loyal', 'colonists', 'save', 'group', 'captured', 'patriots.Show', '2', 'series', 'Brother', 'Against', 'Brother', 'Tories', 'British', 'supporters', 'stge', 'raids', 'patriot', 'neighbors', 'Marion', 'free', 'group', 'American', 'prisoners', 'when', 'British', 'are', 'transfer', 'area.Show', '3', 'series', 'Tory', 'Vengeance', 'Marion', 'nephew', 'Gabe', 'army', 'captured', 'tortured', 'eventually', 'killed', 'Marion', 'vengeance.Bonus', 'materials', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'interview', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'star', 'Elfego', 'Baca', '.A', 'featurette', 'origins', 'historical', 'figures', 'story', 'lives', 'Tales', 'Courage', 'Adventure', '.Still', 'frame', 'galleries', 'TV', 'shows', 'more', '.I', 'do', 'believe', 'shows', 'are', 'bit', 'dated', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'production', 'standards', 'are', 'high', 'quality', '4', '5', 'stars', 'do', 'not', 'plan', 'buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'feel', 'anyone', 'who', 'such', 'shows', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'set']",Walt Disney Treasures - Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox - Legendary Heroes

I initially watched them in b/w TV so it was a pleasure of see them again in color as Walt Disney had the foresight to filmed in color back then even although most of the TVs in United States were black and white.Both series proves to be interesting, entertaining and exciting. They were well acted, well scripted and educational. While the Swamp Fox is the weaker of the two, I thought it was pretty enjoyable series. Elfego Baca on the other hand, was one of the most exciting western TV shows I have seen as a kid and got me into Gunsmokes and other westerns. Although some reviewers wrote that these shows were bit dated, I don't believed that to be the case. When I saw them again as grown adult, they proves just as good as I remembered them as a child. The credit I think goes to the Walt Disney and his production people who created these shows.Like almost every other reviewers here, I am totally angered and appalled by Disney's decision only to released three of ten Elfego Baca episodes and three of eight Swamp Fox episodes. It almost an insult, a slap in a face at such cheapness and pettiness. The two stars I gave reflects nothing on the shows on the DVD but on Disney's decision making process that only shows one-third of the episodes of each series. They probably counted on folks like me who have fond memories of these shows to buy this DVD release despite of its masculated package. They were right much to my personal regret. (If Disney at that time didn't want to release a big DVD, they could have done the Scarcrow series and Johnny Tremain series, I think Scarcrow is three while Tremain was two episodes long.)This DVD release does not come with my recommendation unless you happened to be a die-hard fan of the original shows. Even then, its pretty questionable if you should get. If so, try to get them as cheap as possible since to be perfectly honest, its not worth the price Amazon or Disney is asking for them.",2,Cheapness of Disney,1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,2032,"['fondly', 'remembered', 'Elfego', 'Baca', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'series', 'Disney', 'TV', 'shows', 'initially', 'watched', 'b/w', 'TV', 'was', 'pleasure', 'see', 'again', 'color', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'had', 'foresight', 'filmed', 'color', 'back', 'then', 'even', 'most', 'TVs', 'United', 'States', 'were', 'black', 'white.Both', 'series', 'be', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'were', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'scripted', 'educational', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'weaker', 'two', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'Elfego', 'Baca', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'western', 'TV', 'shows', 'have', 'seen', 'kid', 'got', 'Gunsmokes', 'other', 'westerns', 'reviewers', 'wrote', 'shows', 'were', 'bit', 'dated', 'do', ""n't"", 'believed', 'be', 'case', 'When', 'saw', 'again', 'grown', 'adult', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'remembered', 'child', 'credit', 'think', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'production', 'people', 'who', 'created', 'shows.Like', 'almost', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'am', 'totally', 'angered', 'appalled', 'Disney', 'decision', 'only', 'released', 'three', 'ten', 'Elfego', 'Baca', 'episodes', 'three', 'eight', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'almost', 'insult', 'slap', 'face', 'such', 'cheapness', 'pettiness', 'two', 'stars', 'gave', 'nothing', 'shows', 'DVD', 'Disney', 'decision', 'making', 'process', 'only', 'one-third', 'episodes', 'series', 'probably', 'counted', 'folks', 'who', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'shows', 'buy', 'DVD', 'release', 'masculated', 'package', 'were', 'right', 'much', 'personal', 'regret', 'Disney', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'release', 'big', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Scarcrow', 'series', 'Johnny', 'Tremain', 'series', 'think', 'Scarcrow', 'three', 'Tremain', 'was', 'two', 'episodes', 'long', 'DVD', 'release', 'not', 'come', 'recommendation', 'happened', 'be', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'original', 'shows', 'Even', 'then', 'pretty', 'questionable', 'should', 'get', 'so', 'try', 'get', 'as', 'cheap', 'possible', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'not', 'price', 'Amazon', 'Disney', 'asking']",Walt Disney Treasures - Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox - Legendary Heroes
933361,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000ATQYV0,Mark Baker,"[15, 16]","After the huge success of Davy Crockett during the first season of the TV show ""Disneyland,"" Walt Disney began searching for other heroes from American history for the show.  Two of the ones he settled on are Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox.  Three episodes each of their TV run are included in this two-disc set.Disc one features Elfego Baca (Robert Loggia).  He was a Mexican American who lived in New Mexico during the late 1800's.  He started out as a Sheriff but gave that up to become a lawyer.  He always helped out the poor and downtrodden, as long as they were innocent.  We get episodes 1, 2, and 5.  I think they skipped to 5 since that episode featured Disney vet Annette Funicello.Disc two takes us even further back in time to the Revolutionary War.  Francis Marion, aka The Swamp Fox (Leslie Nielsen) was a hero of the war who led his troops in many raids against the British in the Carolinas.  This set features the first three episodes.  They end on a downer, and the teaser for the next episode is included.  Man, it makes me wish they had more in the set.Since the shows were originally filmed in color, that's what we get here, although the intros from the TV show are often in black and white.  The picture has many flaws, betraying the show's age.  Still, they are very watchable and look like the lavish productions they are.  Extras include an interview with Robert Loggia on disc one and a documentary on Disney's history lessons on disc two.Even though the shows are almost 50 years old, they are still entertaining.  Fans of history or Disney will be glad to add this set to their collection.",5,More Legendary Heroes from Uncle Walt,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,1617,"['huge', 'success', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'first', 'season', 'TV', 'show', 'Disneyland', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'began', 'searching', 'other', 'heroes', 'American', 'history', 'show', 'Two', 'ones', 'settled', 'are', 'Elfego', 'Baca', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'Three', 'TV', 'run', 'are', 'included', 'two-disc', 'set.Disc', 'one', 'Elfego', 'Baca', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'was', 'Mexican', 'American', 'who', 'lived', 'New', 'Mexico', 'late', '1800', 'started', 'out', 'Sheriff', 'gave', 'up', 'become', 'lawyer', 'always', 'helped', 'out', 'poor', 'downtrodden', 'as', 'long', 'were', 'innocent', 'get', 'episodes', '1', '2', '5', 'think', 'skipped', '5', 'episode', 'featured', 'Disney', 'vet', 'Annette', 'Funicello.Disc', 'two', 'even', 'further', 'back', 'time', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'Francis', 'Marion', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'was', 'hero', 'war', 'who', 'led', 'troops', 'many', 'raids', 'British', 'Carolinas', 'set', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'end', 'downer', 'teaser', 'next', 'episode', 'included', 'Man', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'set.Since', 'shows', 'were', 'originally', 'filmed', 'color', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'intros', 'TV', 'show', 'are', 'often', 'black', 'white', 'picture', 'many', 'flaws', 'betraying', 'show', 'age', 'Still', 'are', 'very', 'watchable', 'look', 'lavish', 'productions', 'are', 'Extras', 'include', 'interview', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'disc', 'one', 'documentary', 'Disney', 'history', 'lessons', 'disc', 'two.Even', 'shows', 'are', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'old', 'are', 'still', 'entertaining', 'Fans', 'history', 'Disney', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'add', 'set', 'collection']",Walt Disney Treasures - Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox - Legendary Heroes

933365,A1ER6IYOMM8VCT,B000ATQYV0,"! MR. KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[7, 7]","The final release of Wave 5 is another  worthy release. Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox Legendary Heroes are two lesser known series from Walt Disney's TV show, but are just as entertaining as any of the more popular series from the era. Once again the episodes on this set have had a proper restoration done to them or they were stored with extreme care. The first three episodes  from each show are included here and I know that is bound to disappoint fans of the two series. While it would have been a better idea to give each series their own complete release, this could still be redeemed by releasing a second set with the remaining episodes for  each series on it..... ala volume two. This would probably increase the sales of the first release for sure. The good new is the episodes that are included look remarkably good for their age. Like I mentioned in another Treasures release The Mickey Mouse Club, I was never a big fan of the show growing up during the 60's, but looking back at it now, I find it charming and fun.The first disc includes the first 3 episodes of Elfego Baca which is a fast paced ""shoot em up"" western series starring Robert Loggia (Frank from Scarface). The Swamp Fox is located on disc 2, While I had never heard of either of these shows,  I found them both fun to watch and full of 50's action. Each episode is shown in its entirety with the Walt Disney intro making the episodes clock in at approx. 52 minutes. The extras on the first disc include an interview with Robert Loggia and 3 stills galleries.The second disc holds 3 (why not 4 ?) episodes from The Swamp Fox which look as good as the episodes from Elfego Baca on disc one. There is a lot of griping about how neither show has its complete run on this set, but I think Disney was skeptical of the popularity of the two series. Like I mentioned earlier in my review, this could be redeemed by releasing a volume two with the remaining 3 Baca and 5 Fox episodes on it. I'm sure this is a big reason why this set hasn't sold out....maybe if enough fans call or write Disney, they will answer the request with the remaining episodes for both shows released. Both series' episodes are in color with the intros in black and white as the original openings in color are lost.While both shows deserve their own release, there is no reason to rate this Treasures installment with a low rating. If the set had sold out they might have release the rest, but with such an underwhelming response, I doubt they will ever finish either series on DVD. Considering this was a WDT set that I knew little about, I came out of it very happy with this release and can only hope they will release the remaining episodes of both shows to complete the series(wave 10 please!). The discs are houses in their usual tin case with a reproduction of Disney art, a booklet and the COA.******I CALLED DISNEY AND REQUESTED FOR THE REMAINING EPISODE TO BE RELEASED.

933369,A1Z0LLO7WEKMUW,B000ATQYV0,"Randle Rector ""Randy""","[3, 5]","I give this set five stars for its content, not for the set itself.  I used to watch ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"" when I was kid, and these shows were just slightly before that time. I'd never seen them before, so I bought the set to view what was at least available. Then I went online to see how many episodes were originally aired, and came across a review by a critic on another website. He seemed impressed with ""Elfego Baca,"" but this is what he said about ""The Swamp Fox"":""Whether historically accurate or not, this series places its interest more strongly into the battles and campaigns conducted by patriots like Marion than in any of the individual characters who might have figured into its stories. This focus on strategy, coupled with the physical similarities among the predominantly white male cast, makes it hard (at least for this modern viewer, seeing the show for the first time) to connect emotionally with the individual characters or invest too much into what happens. Next to 'Elfego Baca' and 'Davy Crockett', this series is considerably slower and dryer, in spite of the presence of guns and the inherent drama of galloping horses. It is dated and its historical origins seem to lend to only so much of more than minimal excitement.""Hmmmm.  Then he goes on to say this about Leslie Nielsen and the Revolutionary War:  ""Nielsen, who has been known for the past 25 years as purely a comedy actor, rarely cracks a smile in the three selected episodes, a fact which contributes to the all-too-serious nature of the dated proceedings. With its attentions held steadfastly to a war now rarely considered for the majority of the year, 'The Swamp Fox' is most entertaining in its subplots, where the slightest bit of humanity is enabled to show forth.""Give me a break. Experience has taught me that usually if the critics don't like a show, it must be pretty good! The fact that the Revolutionary War is ""a war now rarely considered for the majority of the year"" is the very reason people need to watch ""The Swamp Fox."" I was excited to see Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"" (2000) which is supposedly based on the same character, but the filmmakers spoiled it by adding unhistorical material simply for the sake of emotional effect (such as the British burning down a church full of civilians, which in reality would have gotten them in extreme trouble with their officers). I have always believed that American history is brimming with stories besides just the Civil War, the Old West, or WWII.  One reviewer I read may have been on to something when he expressed his opinion that Hollywood types today generally don't like the Revolutionary War because ""1)those guys dressed funny, and 2)they were right-wing gun nuts.""I'm watching ""Elfego Baca"" right now and enjoying every minute of it.  I can't wait to get to ""The Swamp Fox.""  I came on here to see how the average person's review compared to the critic's review I quoted above. Sure enough, most of the reviews on here are from people who want ""The Swamp Fox""! And as for Leslie Nielsen ""rarely cracking a smile"" during this series, what did the critic expect, that it would be like ""Airplane""? I'm all for comedy and parodies, but it seems like people today (at least film and television writers) can't take romantic heroism seriously.My only disappointment with this set is the same as other reviewers, that they didn't include all the episodes of each series.  I bought the two complete ""Zorro"" sets (which I love), and ""Zorro"" had a lot more episodes each season, so how difficult would it have been to include all of ""Elfego Baca"" and all of the ""The Swamp Fox"" in this one set? It seems like Disney today doesn't care, just throw out a few tidbits to please the old farts who will watch these old shows anyway. Yet I have seen some younger reviewers on here who appreciate the good material Disney used to produce. I think that if you just give them a chance, today's young people are as bright and intelligent as any generation. Many of them can stretch their attention spans beyond what they've been dealt all their lives and will enjoy and appreciate these fine historical programs.",5,"Don't call me Shirley, Redcoat!",1293235200,"12 25, 2010",2010,4171,"['give', 'set', 'five', 'stars', 'content', 'not', 'set', 'used', 'watch', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Color', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'shows', 'were', 'just', 'slightly', 'time', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'bought', 'set', 'view', 'what', 'was', 'least', 'available', 'Then', 'went', 'online', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'episodes', 'were', 'originally', 'aired', 'came', 'review', 'critic', 'website', 'seemed', 'impressed', 'Elfego', 'Baca', 'what', 'said', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'Whether', 'historically', 'accurate', 'not', 'series', 'interest', 'more', 'strongly', 'battles', 'campaigns', 'conducted', 'patriots', 'Marion', 'individual', 'characters', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'figured', 'stories', 'focus', 'strategy', 'coupled', 'physical', 'similarities', 'predominantly', 'white', 'male', 'cast', 'hard', 'least', 'modern', 'viewer', 'seeing', 'show', 'first', 'time', 'connect', 'emotionally', 'individual', 'characters', 'invest', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'Next', ""'Elfego"", 'Baca', ""'Davy"", 'Crockett', 'series', 'considerably', 'slower', 'dryer', 'spite', 'presence', 'guns', 'inherent', 'drama', 'galloping', 'horses', 'dated', 'historical', 'origins', 'seem', 'lend', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'minimal', 'excitement.', 'Hmmmm', 'Then', 'say', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'Nielsen', 'who', 'been', 'known', 'past', '25', 'years', 'purely', 'comedy', 'actor', 'rarely', 'smile', 'three', 'selected', 'episodes', 'fact', 'all-too-serious', 'nature', 'dated', 'proceedings', 'attentions', 'held', 'steadfastly', 'war', 'now', 'rarely', 'considered', 'majority', 'year', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'most', 'entertaining', 'subplots', 'where', 'slightest', 'bit', 'humanity', 'enabled', 'show', 'forth', 'Give', 'break', 'Experience', 'taught', 'usually', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'show', 'must', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'fact', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'war', 'now', 'rarely', 'considered', 'majority', 'year', 'very', 'reason', 'people', 'need', 'watch', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Patriot', '2000', 'supposedly', 'based', 'same', 'character', 'filmmakers', 'spoiled', 'adding', 'unhistorical', 'material', 'simply', 'sake', 'emotional', 'effect', 'such', 'British', 'burning', 'down', 'church', 'full', 'civilians', 'reality', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'extreme', 'trouble', 'officers', 'have', 'always', 'believed', 'American', 'history', 'brimming', 'stories', 'besides', 'just', 'Civil', 'War', 'Old', 'West', 'WWII', 'One', 'reviewer', 'read', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'when', 'expressed', 'opinion', 'Hollywood', 'types', 'today', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Revolutionary', 'War', '1', 'guys', 'dressed', 'funny', '2', 'were', 'right-wing', 'gun', 'nuts', ""'m"", 'watching', 'Elfego', 'Baca', 'right', 'now', 'enjoying', 'minute', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'came', 'here', 'see', 'how', 'average', 'person', 'review', 'compared', 'critic', 'review', 'quoted', 'Sure', 'enough', 'most', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'rarely', 'cracking', 'smile', 'series', 'what', 'did', 'critic', 'expect', 'would', 'be', 'Airplane', ""'m"", 'comedy', 'parodies', 'people', 'today', 'least', 'film', 'television', 'writers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'romantic', 'heroism', 'only', 'disappointment', 'set', 'same', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'episodes', 'series', 'bought', 'two', 'complete', 'Zorro', 'sets', 'love', 'Zorro', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'episodes', 'season', 'how', 'difficult', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'include', 'Elfego', 'Baca', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'one', 'set', 'Disney', 'today', ""n't"", 'care', 'just', 'throw', 'out', 'few', 'tidbits', 'please', 'old', 'farts', 'who', 'will', 'watch', 'old', 'shows', 'anyway', 'have', 'seen', 'younger', 'reviewers', 'here', 'who', 'appreciate', 'good', 'material', 'Disney', 'used', 'produce', 'think', 'just', 'give', 'chance', 'today', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'bright', 'intelligent', 'generation', 'Many', 'can', 'stretch', 'attention', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dealt', 'lives', 'will', 'enjoy', 'appreciate', 'fine', 'historical', 'programs']",Walt Disney Treasures - Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox - Legendary Heroes
