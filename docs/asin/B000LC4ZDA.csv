1038684,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000LC4ZDA,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Earnest Hemingway penned the novel that inspired this rather pointlessly dull film about four men infatuated with one woman, wasting away in 1920's Paris.  Despite being beautifully shot and effectively acted, especially by an intoxicated Errol Flynn and his screen buddy Eddie Albert, this film is just slow and redundant and offers very little point.  The character interactions meander on vapid and the way the film is constructed bogs down the viewer with boredom and nonsensical character development.  Tyrone Power and Ava Gardner phone this one in, delivering emotionally restrained performances that don't say as much as they think they do, and Mel Ferrer gives an atrocious performance as the unstable and somewhat thick-headed Robert Cohn.  I wanted to punch him square in the face throughout most of the film.  Still, it is sensationally lit and offers some beautiful cinematography, and the underlying storyline of a wounded war vet (emotionally and physically) and his love for a woman who he could never please is compelling, just not conveyed in the most effective way.  And my lord, I never thought that bull fighting could appear so dull, but those scenes were awfully un-thrilling and sleep inducing; and I watched this in the middle of the day!",2,All is boring on the Spanish Riviera...,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,1263,"['Earnest', 'Hemingway', 'penned', 'novel', 'inspired', 'rather', 'pointlessly', 'dull', 'film', 'four', 'men', 'infatuated', 'one', 'woman', 'wasting', 'away', '1920', 'Paris', 'being', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'effectively', 'acted', 'especially', 'intoxicated', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'screen', 'buddy', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'film', 'just', 'slow', 'redundant', 'very', 'little', 'point', 'character', 'interactions', 'meander', 'vapid', 'way', 'film', 'constructed', 'bogs', 'down', 'viewer', 'boredom', 'nonsensical', 'character', 'development', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'phone', 'one', 'delivering', 'emotionally', 'restrained', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'as', 'much', 'think', 'do', 'Mel', 'Ferrer', 'atrocious', 'performance', 'unstable', 'somewhat', 'thick-headed', 'Robert', 'Cohn', 'wanted', 'punch', 'square', 'face', 'most', 'film', 'Still', 'sensationally', 'lit', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'underlying', 'storyline', 'wounded', 'war', 'vet', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'never', 'please', 'compelling', 'just', 'not', 'conveyed', 'most', 'effective', 'way', 'lord', 'never', 'thought', 'bull', 'fighting', 'could', 'appear', 'so', 'dull', 'scenes', 'were', 'awfully', 'un-thrilling', 'sleep', 'inducing', 'watched', 'middle', 'day']",The Sun Also Rises

1038686,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000LC4ZDA,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[74, 79]","""The Sun Also Rises"" was 20th Century Fox's big-budget 'prestige' filmfor 1957, based on Ernest Hemingway's first novel, shot on location in Paris and Mexico (substituting for Spain), and starring the studio's long-reigning superstar, Tyrone Power, surrounded by legendary actors (Ava Gardner, Errol Flynn, Mel Ferrer, and Eddie Albert). With all the talent assembled in front of and behind the camera, producer Darryl F. Zanuck felt confident that the film would be an enduring classic for both his own independent company, and his studio.It wasn't, unfortunately...The film's problem was a fundamental one; the 'Lost Generation'Hemingway wrote of were disillusioned young Americans, who, shatteredby the horror and brutality of the 'Great War', lost their innocence, and became a 'live fast, die young' crowd of expatriates, settling in Paris. These were men and women still in their twenties and thirties...yet the film's stars were all ten to twenty years older! The most glaring case can be seen in the film's star, Tyrone Power. As newspaperman Jake Barnes, a vet whose war injuries render him impotent, unable to satisfy the woman he loves (Ava Gardner), and, therefore, the 'perfect' observer of her romantic entanglements with other men, Power seems more a victim of a midlife crisis than a young man devastated about losing his manhood. In his next-to-last film, Power, at 44, was aging badly, his hair thinning and his slender, 'movie idol' good looks surrendering to a middle-aged paunch. Only when he smiles do the years seem to lift, a bit, and the ""too handsome to be true"" younger man appears. Adding to his physical deterioration was an undiagnosed heart condition, which would kill him, in less than two years.His co-star, Ava Gardner, at 35, was going through a decline, as well, but, like her character, Lady Brett Ashley, her vices were the cause of her self-destruction. Both Brett and Ava were hedonistic women too fond of booze, bullfighters, and nightlife, and Ava's once-classic features were beginning to develop bags and wrinkles that makeup and lighting couldn't hide.Coming off best are Errol Flynn and Eddie Albert. Flynn, at 48, long past his 'glamorous' prime (he and Power had been Hollywood's best-looking 'swashbucklers' of the early 40s), had become a very credible character actor, usually portraying variations of himself. His 'Mike Campbell', an alcoholic, impoverished but clinging to his pride, was, sadly, a dead-on assessment of Errol Flynn, as well. Like Power, he would be dead in two years, a victim of his own excesses. On the other hand, Eddie Albert, at 49, had long been health-conscious, and his performance as a drunk was simply good acting; paired with Flynn, they 'steal' the film, particularly during the famous Pamplona bull run, when the duo flee for their lives (while guzzling wine), and Flynn attempts to use a bad check as a cape to 'fight' a bull!The drama seems overdrawn, the romance lacks 'fire', Robert Evans as a young bullfighter is dreadful, and the resolution is a hollow one. Even with the gorgeous scenery, Hugo Friedhofer's soaring film score, and Henry King's skill as a director, the film fails to generate more than a curiosity value, at the sight of so many actors, past their prime, trying to seem youthful and dynamic.The DVD offers many 'added features', including 'behind the scenes' photos of Power, Flynn, and Gardner, and director Henry King's audio reminiscences of the production, possibly more entertaining than the feature, itself.All-in-all, an ambitious misfire!",3,"Not Great Hemingway, but a Memorable Misfire!",1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,3553,"['Sun', 'Also', 'was', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'big-budget', ""'prestige"", 'filmfor', '1957', 'based', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'first', 'novel', 'shot', 'location', 'Paris', 'Mexico', 'substituting', 'Spain', 'starring', 'studio', 'long-reigning', 'superstar', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'surrounded', 'legendary', 'actors', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'Mel', 'Ferrer', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'talent', 'assembled', 'front', 'camera', 'producer', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'felt', 'confident', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'enduring', 'classic', 'own', 'independent', 'company', 'studio.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'unfortunately', 'film', 'problem', 'was', 'fundamental', 'one', ""'Lost"", ""Generation'Hemingway"", 'wrote', 'were', 'disillusioned', 'young', 'Americans', 'who', 'shatteredby', 'horror', 'brutality', ""'Great"", 'War', 'lost', 'innocence', 'became', ""'live"", 'fast', 'die', 'young', 'crowd', 'expatriates', 'settling', 'Paris', 'were', 'men', 'women', 'still', 'twenties', 'thirties', 'yet', 'film', 'stars', 'were', 'ten', 'twenty', 'years', 'older', 'most', 'glaring', 'case', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'film', 'star', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'newspaperman', 'Jake', 'Barnes', 'vet', 'war', 'injuries', 'render', 'impotent', 'unable', 'satisfy', 'woman', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'therefore', ""'perfect"", 'observer', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'other', 'men', 'Power', 'more', 'victim', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'young', 'man', 'devastated', 'losing', 'manhood', 'next-to-last', 'film', 'Power', '44', 'was', 'aging', 'badly', 'hair', 'thinning', 'slender', 'idol', 'good', 'looks', 'surrendering', 'middle-aged', 'paunch', 'Only', 'when', 'do', 'years', 'seem', 'lift', 'bit', 'too', 'handsome', 'be', 'true', 'younger', 'man', 'Adding', 'physical', 'deterioration', 'was', 'undiagnosed', 'heart', 'condition', 'would', 'kill', 'less', 'two', 'years.His', 'co-star', 'Ava', 'Gardner', '35', 'was', 'going', 'decline', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'Lady', 'Brett', 'Ashley', 'vices', 'were', 'cause', 'self-destruction', 'Brett', 'Ava', 'were', 'hedonistic', 'women', 'too', 'fond', 'booze', 'bullfighters', 'nightlife', 'Ava', 'once-classic', 'features', 'were', 'beginning', 'develop', 'bags', 'wrinkles', 'makeup', 'lighting', 'could', ""n't"", 'hide.Coming', 'off', 'best', 'are', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'Flynn', '48', 'long', ""'glamorous"", 'prime', 'Power', 'had', 'been', 'Hollywood', 'best-looking', ""'swashbucklers"", 'early', '40s', 'had', 'become', 'very', 'credible', 'character', 'actor', 'usually', 'portraying', 'variations', ""'Mike"", 'Campbell', 'alcoholic', 'impoverished', 'clinging', 'pride', 'was', 'sadly', 'dead-on', 'assessment', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'as', 'well', 'Power', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'two', 'years', 'victim', 'own', 'excesses', 'other', 'hand', 'Eddie', 'Albert', '49', 'had', 'long', 'been', 'health-conscious', 'performance', 'drunk', 'was', 'simply', 'good', 'acting', 'paired', 'Flynn', ""'steal"", 'film', 'particularly', 'famous', 'Pamplona', 'bull', 'run', 'when', 'duo', 'flee', 'lives', 'guzzling', 'wine', 'Flynn', 'attempts', 'use', 'bad', 'check', 'cape', ""'fight"", 'bull', 'drama', 'overdrawn', 'romance', 'Robert', 'Evans', 'young', 'bullfighter', 'dreadful', 'resolution', 'hollow', 'one', 'Even', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'Hugo', 'Friedhofer', 'soaring', 'film', 'score', 'Henry', 'King', 'skill', 'director', 'film', 'generate', 'more', 'curiosity', 'value', 'sight', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'past', 'prime', 'trying', 'seem', 'youthful', 'dynamic.The', 'DVD', 'many', ""'added"", 'features', 'including', 'scenes', 'photos', 'Power', 'Flynn', 'Gardner', 'director', 'Henry', 'King', 'audio', 'reminiscences', 'production', 'possibly', 'more', 'entertaining', 'feature', 'itself.All-in-all', 'ambitious', 'misfire']",The Sun Also Rises

It serves as yet another example of how Hemingway's work rarely translates onto the silver screen. Tyrone Power, Ava Gardner (beginning to look bloated from excessive drinking), Errol Flynn (the poster child of bloatedness from excessive drinking), and Eddie Albert (bloated, but not from alcohol) play a bunch of literate types who lounge about various western European locales drinking (not much of a stretch for Gardner and Flynn here) and moping and whining. Each male character increases his drinking, moping, and whining when left by Gardner for another male rival. This more or less describes what drags on over the course of 2+ hours. The real stars here are the European scenery and Cinemascope, which captures and conveys the grandeur and glory of the film's setting. Other than that, the only other value of the movie is the vivid illustration it provides of why Robert Evans' acting career was so short lived. His open-mouthed, blank stares while waiting for the bull charges almost inadvertently redeem this bland flick.

I admire the courage of the filmmakers for their faithfulness to Hemingway's work, which was a challenge to translate for the screen. The novel is really a slice of life in which character study takes precedence over story. This is about the so-called ""lost"" generation of people who try without success to find some meaning in their lives after the horrors of the First World War. As a theme, it has enormous relevance even today.If you dissect this film, what you have is one scene, the same scene, repeated over and over and over: The actors order drinks, smoke cigarettes, and engage in witty dialogue. In an outdoor caf&eacute;, in a restaurant, in a bar, in an apartment, in a hotel, in Paris, in Pamplona, in ... are you getting the picture? But don't despair, this is an absolutely fascinating movie despite the fact that nothing really happens. How can that be? First, Hemingway's characters are interesting as hell. Second, Henry King was a brilliant director and put his stamp on every aspect of this production. Third, the Cinemascope photography of Paris and Spain (or Mexico) is staggering. The scenes in Paris during the first part of the film made me want to get on an airplane. And fourth, these were superb film actors at the top of their form.Tyrone Power was a highly underrated actor. In this film he has one of the most difficult roles for any actor, playing a character who is depressed all the time. Actors like to play active motivations. Playing depressed is about as difficult as it can get for an actor and Power is superb in playing dour without losing his natural charm. Mel Ferrer is perfectly cast as the droopy Robert Cohn, who is both likeable and hateful. Juliette Greco positively jumps off the screen in a small part at the beginning of the film. Even the way she says a single word, yes, is exciting. Eddie Albert, another underrated actor, is great in a part that would have confounded a lesser actor. The real surprise is Errol Flynn, appearing here in a character role at the end of his career and short life. He is hysterical as a drunk among drunks (they are all drunk) and steals every scene he's in. During the bull running scenes in Pamplona, Flynn and Albert are wonderful at the kind of physical comedy that Peter Sellers would have admired. I even liked Robert Evans' portrayal of a Spanish bullfighter and don't understand why everyone makes fun of his acting.But the heart of the film is stolen by another underrated actor, Ava Gardner, who gives the performance of a lifetime as the disturbed Lady Brett Ashley. Gardner nails every aspect of this complicated personality and in most scenes she is able to convey an incredible variety of emotional states. I loved one scene in the Cafe Select in which she switches from wild abandon to serious concern and back again in a matter of seconds. And on top of it all, she is drop dead gorgeous as few actresses have ever been. Even her own dissipation as she approached middle age works for the part. What a pleasure to watch her in this movie! I find it bizarre that, in one of the special features, some hack critic suggests that Gardner was miscast.At the end of The Sun Also Rises, I found myself saying, ""So what the hell just happened?"" I'm not entirely certain, but it simply makes me want to watch it over and over. This is a truly great film.",5,A gorgeous classic without a plot!

I don't agree with those who think the stars are too old for their roles. I'm amazed at the number of reviewers who actually believe that the characters in the book were ""in their 20s"". Perhaps they listened to the commentary on this film rather than reading the book. The book plainly states that Brett Ashley and Robert Cohn are both 34 years old and Jake was at least that old, probably older and physically aged by having been in the Great War and his physical and emotional sufferings. We have to realize that in that period of time 34 years old was much older than it is now. And, these people had led drifting, pointless, alcohol soaked lives for several years.  To me, Tyrone Power is incapable of giving a bad performance in any role where he is cast as a sensitive, rather unhappy man. And, Ava Gardner was probably the only actress at the time who could portray a woman driven by her love for a man and her inability to accept his physical limitations. Realizing that sex is more important to you than being with the man you love must be a disturbing thing leading to more and more alcohol consumption. I think it is her self awareness that drives her so relentlessly. Errol Flynn, God Bless Him, had only to play himself.  Jose Ferrer is excellent in a difficult, thankless role with many shadings. I do find fault with the direction of the film. I think it moves too slowly in many places relying too heavily on location and spectacle to hold one's interest. But, perhaps it's aim was to show the utter boredom and listlessness of the lives of people trying to somehow manufacture interesting lives for themselves and failing miserably.
