It's more than just a story about a boy and his love for his pony that gets sick and dies; it's about life and fitting in, about who we are and how we choose to be accepted. Everyone does a fine job on the screen. Best perhaps is Louis Calhern as Grandpa, who once led a wagon train across the plains. Robert Mitchum is the laconic ranch hand Billy Buck.

They were the ""A"" studio of ""B"" pictures who specialized in Westerns (John Wayne & Gene Autry got their start there) and Serials (THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL, THE LONE RANGER). The company was founded in 1935 and produced and released films until 1959. Their trademark logo of a giant eagle perched atop a craggy mountain peak is still in use today. After World War II Republic began to produce the occasional ""prestige"" picture which had a bigger budget and name stars and directors. John Ford did THE QUIET MAN (1952) there, Orson Welles did a highly stylized version of MACBETH (1948), Fritz Lang made the creepy and disturbing HOUSE BY THE RIVER (1951), and Lewis Milestone (ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT) made this film in 1949. It was one of the few color movies to come from Republic (THE QUIET MAN is another). I see that here and on imdb that a number of people point out that it isn't faithful to John Steinbeck's book. That is true but as Steinbeck himself wrote the screenplay, then at least he had a hand in the finished product and he didn't complain about it.For years THE RED PONY has only been available in washed out, substandard prints first on VHS and then later on low budget DVD. This new version from Olive Films goes back to the best source material and looks and sounds gorgeous. The sound is equally important for the film's score was written by Aaron Copland. Now it can be heard in all of its glory. If you know the orchestral suite than you'll recognize it immediately throughout the film. The casting is perfect with Myrna Loy wonderfully understating the role of the mother who is estranged from her husband. Veteran thespian Louis Calhern makes the talkative grandfather come alive, and Robert Mitchum (31 when this film was made) gets the opportunity to play a gentler character much like he would later do in RYAN'S DAUGHTER. The story of a young boy learning to raise a pony and the responsibilities it entails never becomes too sentimental or cloying thanks to Steinbeck's screenplay and Milestone's creative direction. It is quite obvious that Walt Disney, who had yet to produce a full length live action feature, took this movie as his template. If you've never seen THE RED PONY or haven't seen it in years then you need to see this version. It looks even better now thematically as well as visually then it did in 1949.",5,Finally A Gorgeous Print Of This 1949 Classic!,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,2432,"['Republic', 'Pictures', 'was', 'top', 'heap', 'down', 'Poverty', 'Row', 'were', 'A', 'studio', 'B', 'pictures', 'who', 'specialized', 'Westerns', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Gene', 'Autry', 'got', 'start', 'Serials', 'THE', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'CAPTAIN', 'MARVEL', 'THE', 'LONE', 'RANGER', 'company', 'was', 'founded', '1935', 'produced', 'released', 'films', '1959', 'trademark', 'logo', 'giant', 'eagle', 'perched', 'craggy', 'mountain', 'peak', 'still', 'use', 'today', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Republic', 'began', 'produce', 'occasional', 'prestige', 'picture', 'had', 'bigger', 'budget', 'name', 'stars', 'directors', 'John', 'Ford', 'did', 'THE', 'QUIET', 'MAN', '1952', 'there', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'did', 'highly', 'stylized', 'version', 'MACBETH', '1948', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'made', 'creepy', 'disturbing', 'HOUSE', 'BY', 'THE', 'RIVER', '1951', 'Lewis', 'Milestone', 'ALL', 'QUIET', 'ON', 'THE', 'WESTERN', 'FRONT', 'made', 'film', '1949', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'color', 'movies', 'come', 'Republic', 'THE', 'QUIET', 'MAN', 'see', 'here', 'imdb', 'number', 'people', 'point', 'out', ""n't"", 'faithful', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'book', 'true', 'Steinbeck', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'then', 'least', 'had', 'hand', 'finished', 'product', 'did', ""n't"", 'complain', 'it.For', 'years', 'RED', 'PONY', 'only', 'been', 'available', 'washed', 'out', 'substandard', 'prints', 'first', 'VHS', 'then', 'later', 'low', 'budget', 'DVD', 'new', 'version', 'Olive', 'Films', 'back', 'best', 'source', 'material', 'gorgeous', 'sound', 'equally', 'important', 'film', 'score', 'was', 'written', 'Aaron', 'Copland', 'Now', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'glory', 'know', 'orchestral', 'suite', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'immediately', 'film', 'casting', 'perfect', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'wonderfully', 'understating', 'role', 'mother', 'who', 'estranged', 'husband', 'Veteran', 'thespian', 'Louis', 'Calhern', 'talkative', 'grandfather', 'come', 'alive', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', '31', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'opportunity', 'play', 'gentler', 'character', 'much', 'would', 'later', 'do', 'RYAN', 'DAUGHTER', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'learning', 'raise', 'pony', 'responsibilities', 'never', 'becomes', 'too', 'sentimental', 'cloying', 'thanks', 'Steinbeck', 'screenplay', 'Milestone', 'creative', 'direction', 'quite', 'obvious', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'who', 'had', 'yet', 'produce', 'full', 'length', 'live', 'action', 'feature', 'took', 'movie', 'template', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'THE', 'RED', 'PONY', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'years', 'then', 'need', 'see', 'version', 'even', 'better', 'now', 'thematically', 'as', 'well', 'visually', 'then', 'did', '1949']",The Red Pony

The score by Aaron Copland is just great, as is the photography by Tony Gaudio. It's one of the very few times Republic Pictures used Technicolor instead of their inferior two color Trucolor system. Even though the packaging proclaims ""Digitally Mastered from the Original Film Negative"", it's just so-so quality wise, about equal to the earlier Laserdisc release. Technicolor can and should look much better than this! The packaging also indicates the original theatrical trailer is included (as it was on the Laserdisc) but I couldn't find it on the DVD. Apparently Artisan just doesn't care much about their classic film library, unless John Wayne is involved, and even there some of the end product is mediocre (such as ""The Quiet Man"").

755527,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00009NH9W,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","The most truly American of classical composers, Aaron Copland's stirring music score is what still resonates most in this almost forgotten 1949 film, even though it boasts an impressive pedigree - a screenplay by John Steinbeck based on his own collection of short stories, direction from film veteran Lewis Milestone (All Quiet on the Western Front, Steinbeck'sOf Mice and Men), and A-list stars in Robert Mitchum and Myrna Loy. It was the most expensive picture ever made at Republic Studios, a poverty-row operation that was kept afloat thanks to a successful string of John Wayne westerns. On the surface, the movie seems like kid-friendly fare, but it also presents some interesting psychological subtext on the family unit and a surprisingly graphic scene that triggers the story's climax.The story focuses on a young boy named Tom Tiflin, who lives with his parents on a ranch in the Salinas Valley. His no-nonsense mother Alice was raised in the area, but his emotionally indifferent father Fred comes from San Jose and has never felt at home despite spending years on the ranch. On a long-term visit to the ranch, Alice's father is an old coot who repeats the same stories about the old West much to the consternation of Fred. Moreover, Fred's constantly conflicted state has pushed Tom closer to devoted ranch hand Billy Buck. Family tensions give way to a red pony, Fred's present to Tom. Naturally, the boy focuses his full attention on the pony, even cutting class to take care of it after it ambled outside during a heavy rainstorm. The rest of the story plays the way one would expect from a parable about personal obligations and coping with tragedy. Milestone lends a painterly quality to the proceedings, but he doesn't delve deeply into the characters' motivations. This was probably an intentional decision since the picture seems designed to be more of a Disney-type live-action film. The superficial treatment, however, leaves some aspects of the story oddly unexplained.The resulting lapse leaves the actors to fill in the blanks. Even in a sketchily written role like Billy, Mitchum exudes his famously coiled presence in the face of a character that seems too good to be true. Stripped of her sophisticated charms, a ghostly-looking Loy lends a stoic dignity to Alice that gives just a small glimpse into the marital struggles her character is obviously facing. A year away from playing his archetypal role of Oliver Wendell Holmes inThe Magnificent Yankee, Louis Calhern brings bluster and unexpected poignancy to the grandfather. As Fred, Steinbeck look-alike Shepperd Strudwick does the best he can in a relatively thankless role. Nine-year-old Peter Miles is generally affecting as Tom, though he can't seem to get past the boy's obsession into something more moving. That is indeed theWicked Witch of the West, Margaret Hamilton, playing a minor role as Tom's perturbed schoolteacher. As noted with Loy's appearance, the color seems sadly faded in the print housed in the 2003 DVD, and unfortunately there are no extras offered - a true shame considering the talent involved.",4,"A Modest, Worthwhile Steinbeck-Penned Tale with a Powerful Copland Score and a Grade-A Cast",1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,3105,"['most', 'truly', 'American', 'classical', 'composers', 'Aaron', 'Copland', 'stirring', 'music', 'score', 'what', 'still', 'most', 'almost', 'forgotten', '1949', 'film', 'even', 'impressive', 'pedigree', 'screenplay', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'based', 'own', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'direction', 'film', 'veteran', 'Lewis', 'Milestone', 'All', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', ""Steinbeck'sOf"", 'Mice', 'Men', 'A-list', 'stars', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'was', 'most', 'expensive', 'picture', 'ever', 'made', 'Republic', 'Studios', 'poverty-row', 'operation', 'was', 'kept', 'afloat', 'thanks', 'successful', 'string', 'John', 'Wayne', 'surface', 'movie', 'kid-friendly', 'fare', 'also', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'subtext', 'family', 'unit', 'surprisingly', 'graphic', 'scene', 'story', 'climax.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Tom', 'Tiflin', 'who', 'parents', 'ranch', 'Salinas', 'Valley', 'no-nonsense', 'mother', 'Alice', 'was', 'raised', 'area', 'emotionally', 'indifferent', 'father', 'Fred', 'San', 'Jose', 'never', 'felt', 'home', 'spending', 'years', 'ranch', 'long-term', 'visit', 'ranch', 'Alice', 'father', 'old', 'coot', 'who', 'same', 'stories', 'old', 'West', 'much', 'consternation', 'Fred', 'Moreover', 'Fred', 'constantly', 'conflicted', 'state', 'pushed', 'Tom', 'closer', 'devoted', 'ranch', 'hand', 'Billy', 'Buck', 'Family', 'tensions', 'give', 'way', 'red', 'pony', 'Fred', 'present', 'Tom', 'Naturally', 'boy', 'full', 'attention', 'pony', 'even', 'cutting', 'class', 'take', 'care', 'ambled', 'outside', 'heavy', 'rainstorm', 'rest', 'story', 'way', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'parable', 'personal', 'obligations', 'coping', 'tragedy', 'Milestone', 'painterly', 'quality', 'proceedings', ""n't"", 'delve', 'deeply', 'characters', 'motivations', 'was', 'probably', 'intentional', 'decision', 'picture', 'designed', 'be', 'more', 'Disney-type', 'live-action', 'film', 'superficial', 'treatment', 'however', 'aspects', 'story', 'oddly', 'unexplained.The', 'resulting', 'lapse', 'actors', 'fill', 'blanks', 'Even', 'sketchily', 'written', 'role', 'Billy', 'Mitchum', 'famously', 'coiled', 'presence', 'face', 'character', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'Stripped', 'sophisticated', 'charms', 'ghostly-looking', 'Loy', 'stoic', 'dignity', 'Alice', 'just', 'small', 'glimpse', 'marital', 'character', 'obviously', 'facing', 'year', 'away', 'playing', 'archetypal', 'role', 'Oliver', 'Wendell', 'Holmes', 'inThe', 'Magnificent', 'Yankee', 'Louis', 'Calhern', 'bluster', 'unexpected', 'poignancy', 'grandfather', 'Fred', 'Steinbeck', 'look-alike', 'Shepperd', 'Strudwick', 'best', 'can', 'relatively', 'thankless', 'role', 'Nine-year-old', 'Peter', 'Miles', 'generally', 'affecting', 'Tom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'boy', 'obsession', 'something', 'more', 'moving', 'indeed', 'theWicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'playing', 'minor', 'role', 'Tom', 'perturbed', 'schoolteacher', 'noted', 'Loy', 'appearance', 'color', 'sadly', 'faded', 'print', 'housed', '2003', 'DVD', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'extras', 'offered', 'true', 'shame', 'considering', 'talent', 'involved']",The Red Pony
