1250333,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B0024OW1QQ,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[2, 2]","I enjoy the Foyle's War series, especially for its wonderful scenery and very real sense of time period.  The entire series manages to capture life in a country at war.  It presents not only the returning casualties but more especially the casualties of all kinds at home.  I first came across this in an old movie,Mrs. Miniver.  Here everyone was worried about the possible loss of beloved men fighting in Europe, but the actual casualty when it occurred was that of the new young wife of a soldier.  Folye's war makes it clear that no one really escaped hurt and loss.  What makes these mysteries more captivating is the stolid insistence of the central character that justice is owed to the victims of crimes and their families, even in time of war.  No one, even an important figure in the war effort, is above the law, and more importantly no one, even an enemy POW, is beneath the law.  Inspector Foyle is the personification of the sane rule of law working in the midst of an insane and lawless world.  He is like a knight who refuses to give up his cause, even if it appears lost.  As he notes in more than one episode and in more than one way, if you suspend the rules of the law of the land because of the war, you are no better than the enemy with whom you are fighting it.",5,"If you suspend the rules of law in the land because of the war, you are no better than the enemy with whom you are fighting",1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,1284,"['enjoy', 'Foyle', 'War', 'series', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'scenery', 'very', 'real', 'sense', 'time', 'period', 'entire', 'series', 'manages', 'capture', 'life', 'country', 'war', 'not', 'only', 'returning', 'casualties', 'more', 'especially', 'casualties', 'kinds', 'home', 'first', 'came', 'old', 'movie', 'Mrs', 'Miniver', 'Here', 'everyone', 'was', 'worried', 'possible', 'loss', 'beloved', 'men', 'fighting', 'Europe', 'actual', 'casualty', 'when', 'occurred', 'was', 'new', 'young', 'wife', 'soldier', 'Folye', 'war', 'clear', 'one', 'really', 'escaped', 'hurt', 'loss', 'What', 'mysteries', 'more', 'captivating', 'stolid', 'insistence', 'central', 'character', 'justice', 'owed', 'victims', 'crimes', 'families', 'even', 'time', 'war', 'one', 'even', 'important', 'figure', 'war', 'effort', 'law', 'more', 'importantly', 'one', 'even', 'enemy', 'POW', 'law', 'Inspector', 'Foyle', 'personification', 'sane', 'rule', 'law', 'working', 'midst', 'insane', 'lawless', 'world', 'knight', 'who', 'give', 'up', 'cause', 'even', 'lost', 'more', 'one', 'episode', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'suspend', 'rules', 'law', 'land', 'war', 'are', 'better', 'enemy', 'whom', 'are', 'fighting']",Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day

1250337,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,B0024OW1QQ,"brian komyathy ""Thanks for scouting out my pa...","[81, 82]","Michael Kitchen. Never heard of him, I'm sure, you're saying. That would be your loss, especially if you enjoy a great period piece now and then. Kitchen was marvelous as the British agent for a British landlord with holdings in 19th century Ireland, in ""The Hanging Gale."" And now Kitchen triumphs again as a detective chief superintendent Christopher Foyle. He often identifies himself, however, rather more charmingly: ""My name is Foyle. I'm a police officer."" No badge is shown or papers presented while so introducing himself. Such would be superfluous though as Kitchen's Foyle, in mannerisms, demeanor, as well as the way his carries himself, makes it rather apparent that he is in law enforcement. And to boot, all this takes place in the early days of 1940, ""in the beautiful southern English countryside amid the disorder and danger of World War II""(to quote the packaging). The episodes herein ""concentrate on the influence the war had on the home front.""As in all Foyle episodes a murder takes place and Kitchen methodically goes about solving it. He has a sergeant for assistance as well as an actress side-kick (whose most unusual name in real life is Honeysuckle Weeks) who plays an army soldier seconded to drive for Foyle, who is without a license to do so. Like in many detective dramas the who did it is rather less important than the drama getting to that point. Actually, these hour and forty minute long Foyle episodes often go by for me without my giving much serious contemplation toward the solution Foyle seeks. Ever play chess and really focus on 3, 4, 5, 6 possible moves in advance and then play a casual game of chess just for fun? That's how I personally watch Foyle's War. I'm not too interested in guessing then second guessing again & again who I think is the murderer. (I do do that often with David Suchet's Hercule Poirot Agatha Christie mystery dramas, but alas, do too much guessing wrong there, however.) Watching Foyle is also much a period drama, as I've said, giving one a feel for 1939-1940 England, the country lanes, the occasional military vehicle and soldier(s), authentic clothes, hats, people on missions greater than themselves passing through the lens.""A lesson in murder"" is what a character terms war in an episode of this series. The episode balances the views of conscientious objectors with the need to contribute to a cause thought noble and just by most. An interesting angle of the Foyle series is the notion that the rule of law remains central even in a time of great moral stress; not in the sense of civil liberties ala Lincoln in the US Civil War, but in the sense that a murder is a murder whether a country is at war or not and such a crime out result in punishment. In this first episode, for example, a military man tries to reason with Foyle that taking him away from the invaluable work he was doing, leading a team trying to combat Nazi Germany, would serve no end, certainly no greater good. Foyle's driver later asks him whether he was tempted to let the man go, so to speak; give him a pass because of the circumstances Britain found itself in at the moment. Yes, Foyle, answered, in so many words. Nevertheless, we see the man in question being soon dealt with showing that Foyle's sympathies, war reason, didn't get the best of him in the end. Such evinces the quality of this series---sympathies for varied viewpoints are shown, but in the end much of which most could seen as right, is followed through on....thanks to the able Michael Kitchen. Kitchen, moreover, is an actor who is most accomplished even when not saying anything. Words are not thrown about in this series. In one episode (I won't say which as it will give away a bit of one story) Honeysuckle Weeks character Sam admits to Foyle that she doesn't know what to say after an unfortunate tragedy. To which Foyle responds: ""I don't know what to say either."" It's the epitome of Michael Kitchen's performance in this series---knowing what to say when words are warranted and saying little or nothing when they are not. Cheers",5,"""My name's Foyle.

1250342,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0024OW1QQ,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 2]","Since there doesn't seem to be a box set for ALL the Foyle's War series, I suppose I'll write my review here (I've seen all 7 seasons, ""7"" if you count the two short seasons separately).  There are MANY good things about this series, most of them amply enumerated by other reviews.  I, myself, was thoroughly engrossed by Seasons 1 and 2, eating up a new show each night (at 100 minutes each, no mean feat on successive work nights!).  As I was watching, Foyle (the detective) reminded me somewhat of Detective Columbo - no histrionics, very understated, taking that extra look that seems to bore right through you, and basically talking and observing (both human behaviour and the physical evidence) his way to the perpetrator.  The plotting of the stories is very different - with Foyle you do not know who the perpetrator is until it's revealed by Foyle, and sometimes the story ""cheats"" in that it doesn't give you all the information you need to solve it at home (a key name is withheld or a conversation unheard), but in both series the result isn't the point - it's the interaction between the characters, centred on the strong central performance by the lead.In another way Foyle is much like Columbo - they are both routinely underestimated by their criminal opponents.  It's a truism in historical fiction (look no further than Arthur Conan Doyle) that police officers were dim, brutish, and of the lower classes.  Certainly, in one episode we meet an old girlfriend of Foyle whose gentried father objected to their pairing because of his ""low station"" as a police officer.  Again - it is presumed that anyone with any competence would have been called up by the military in WWII, thus Foyle must be the dregs to still be holding a position in civilian law enforcement (as opposed to his limping lieutenant, shot up in Norway and discharged on medical grounds, an ""honourable"" reason to be in civilian clothing).The series progresses through the war hitting its major highlights, with the mystery of the week involving some central aspect of the war.  For example, there is a show involving D-day, a couple centred on the Battle of Britain (Foyle's son Andrew is a Spitfire pilot), etc.  Interestingly, many of the crimes represent a seedy side of humanity - a base commander who rapes his female orderlies and has it covered up because he's ""vital"" to the war effort, an industrialist making deals with the Nazis in anticipation of the invasion, etc. - in direct contrast to the romantic vision of the good and stoic Islander facing off the Nazi threat.  Unfortunately, in later seasons the series takes on a sameness that is a little grating (perhaps only because I watched the shows so closely together - but then, that's why you buy a DVD set).  EACH mystery involves a central event of the war.  There are multiple times when Andrew is involved (a murder on his base, a murder of a childhood friend) and even more involving Foyle's driver Samantha (Sam's roomate is murdered, her flat is bombed, her boss is under suspicion of murder (twice!), etc.).  It becomes almost ludicrous the convolutions the show goes through in order to involve Sam in the later seasons when she is no longer with the Police Department.  In addition, many of the shows are intricately plotted, but to the point where an extremely unlikely coincidence is required to bring it all together at the end (this isn't a problem with any individual show, but you start to notice it when you watch them all closely together).Perhaps this is being nitpicky - part of the show's charm (like Columbo) is the way it sticks to the formula, how an inter-related series of events eventually traps the bad guy, and the calm unruffled centre of Detective Chief Superintendent Foyle.  I especially loved the contrast between this show and a typical American-style crime show as demonstrated in the episode ""Invasion"".  The show's title does not refer to D-day or an impending Nazi landing, but to the arrival of American troops in England.  It's made quite clear that some people clearly would have preferred the Nazis (who, after all, were seen by many to be simply ""Germans"" - from the civilized land of Beethoven, Goethe, and Schopenhauer - and not loud-mouthed colonial rabble like the Yanks).

1250348,A2RETJZ8461X5L,B0024OW1QQ,dj,"[3, 4]","Foyle's War is superb in all respects: scripts, cinematograpy and themes historically acurate for the period.As I viewed the series, I became immediately aware that the themes\issues portrayed are universal, not tied to any time period or even country.War brings out the worst and best in people. The best qualities: courage, love of country, selflessness. The worst qualities: stereotyping of the enemy, violence against any race or group linked to the enemy, the paranoia stemming from fear.In one episode, an Italian restrurant owner is burned alive in his apartment over his restrurant by a mob (most of whom have been his friends and customers before Italy entered the war against England). Throughout the series the military is willing to consider any means to defeat the enemy including the use of chemical and biological weapons. One character asks, ""If we do these kinds of things, are we any better than the enemy?"" The frightened people of the UK are willing to happily sacrifice their civil liberties in the name of security.Today we are still grappling with these question. Wars take many different forms today.The series reminded me that the so-called ""Patriot Act"" has led us Americans in the post 9\11 era to sacrifice civil liberties to defeat terrorism. All people of Arab derivation (including those who are seperated by generations from their immigrant ancestors)are subjected to abuse and too often to physical violence. We tend to paint all perceived enemies with a broad stereotyping brush.I grew up during the ""Cold War."" As a child, I remember being terified by ""duck and cover"" drills. We were all certain we could be ""nuked"" by the commies at any minute. Such fear gave rise to McCarthyism. My father was the superintendent of a small rural school in the Missouri Ozarks, not an area which was likely to be a target for rampant communist subversion. My father got into trouble and was investigated when he refused, on principle, to sign a loyalty oath. Witch-hunts and blacklists swept the U.S. up into a cloud of paranoia. Now we have the ""War on Terrorism"" and requests for more restrains on personal liberties to win it. Are we going to repeat the same mistakes? We never seem to learn from history. These same fears and excesses brought Hitler to power. How many liberties are we willing to conceede in order to have ""security""?War also promotes greed in many. There are always those who use war to get rich. Foyle has to deal with the profeiteers and so do we; those who's only concern is to use the fog of war to enhance their own wealth and power.Foyle's War brilliantly deals with all the issues and behaviors that are attendant to war. The actors are superb; especially Kitchen (as Foyle) and Honeysuckle Weeks (as his assistant).The scripts are beautifully written and just as brilliantly acted.This series is vastly superior to the wretched ""reality series"" and bad talent shows that have virtually taken over U.S. television.Order some British tv series and discover a whole new world.",5,Best Series Ever!,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,3024,"['Foyle', 'War', 'superb', 'respects', 'scripts', 'cinematograpy', 'themes', 'historically', 'acurate', 'period.As', 'viewed', 'series', 'became', 'immediately', 'aware', 'themes\\issues', 'portrayed', 'are', 'universal', 'not', 'tied', 'time', 'period', 'even', 'country.War', 'brings', 'out', 'worst', 'best', 'people', 'best', 'qualities', 'courage', 'love', 'country', 'selflessness', 'worst', 'qualities', 'stereotyping', 'enemy', 'violence', 'race', 'group', 'linked', 'enemy', 'paranoia', 'stemming', 'fear.In', 'one', 'episode', 'Italian', 'restrurant', 'owner', 'burned', 'alive', 'apartment', 'restrurant', 'mob', 'most', 'whom', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'customers', 'Italy', 'entered', 'war', 'England', 'series', 'military', 'willing', 'consider', 'means', 'defeat', 'enemy', 'including', 'use', 'chemical', 'biological', 'weapons', 'One', 'character', 'do', 'kinds', 'things', 'are', 'better', 'enemy', 'frightened', 'people', 'UK', 'are', 'willing', 'happily', 'sacrifice', 'civil', 'liberties', 'name', 'security.Today', 'are', 'still', 'grappling', 'question', 'Wars', 'take', 'many', 'different', 'forms', 'today.The', 'series', 'reminded', 'so-called', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'led', 'Americans', 'post', '9\\11', 'era', 'sacrifice', 'civil', 'liberties', 'defeat', 'terrorism', 'people', 'Arab', 'derivation', 'including', 'who', 'are', 'seperated', 'generations', 'immigrant', 'ancestors', 'are', 'subjected', 'abuse', 'too', 'often', 'physical', 'violence', 'tend', 'paint', 'perceived', 'enemies', 'broad', 'stereotyping', 'brush.I', 'grew', 'up', 'Cold', 'War', 'child', 'remember', 'being', 'terified', 'duck', 'cover', 'drills', 'were', 'certain', 'could', 'be', 'nuked', 'commies', 'minute', 'Such', 'fear', 'gave', 'rise', 'McCarthyism', 'father', 'was', 'superintendent', 'small', 'rural', 'school', 'Missouri', 'Ozarks', 'not', 'area', 'was', 'likely', 'be', 'target', 'rampant', 'communist', 'subversion', 'father', 'got', 'trouble', 'was', 'investigated', 'when', 'refused', 'principle', 'sign', 'loyalty', 'oath', 'Witch-hunts', 'blacklists', 'swept', 'U.S.', 'up', 'cloud', 'paranoia', 'Now', 'have', 'War', 'Terrorism', 'requests', 'more', 'restrains', 'personal', 'liberties', 'win', 'going', 'repeat', 'same', 'mistakes', 'never', 'seem', 'learn', 'history', 'same', 'fears', 'excesses', 'brought', 'Hitler', 'power', 'How', 'many', 'liberties', 'are', 'willing', 'conceede', 'order', 'have', 'security', 'War', 'also', 'greed', 'many', 'are', 'always', 'who', 'use', 'war', 'get', 'rich', 'Foyle', 'deal', 'profeiteers', 'so', 'do', 'who', 'only', 'concern', 'use', 'fog', 'war', 'enhance', 'own', 'wealth', 'power.Foyle', 'War', 'brilliantly', 'issues', 'behaviors', 'are', 'attendant', 'war', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'especially', 'Kitchen', 'Foyle', 'Honeysuckle', 'Weeks', 'assistant', '.The', 'scripts', 'are', 'beautifully', 'written', 'just', 'as', 'brilliantly', 'acted.This', 'series', 'vastly', 'superior', 'wretched', 'reality', 'series', 'bad', 'talent', 'shows', 'have', 'virtually', 'taken', 'over', 'U.S.', 'television.Order', 'British', 'tv', 'series', 'discover', 'whole', 'new', 'world']",Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day

1250357,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B0024OW1QQ,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[236, 238]","""FOYLE'S WAR: Sets 1-5"" presents British Home Front war-life through poignant topics, compelling suspense, and many mirthful moments. Masterpiece Theatre created a 6-year running (2002-2008) British mystery masterpiece.  They outdid themselves. This ""War Years"" series of 19 feature-length episodes is now available as a set and thus a better price. Wow, 32 hours, of sure-to-please mystery/period drama.It is a 1940-45 Southern England countryside experience not to be missed.  It serves as a home-front view documentary of the English WWII involvement and resulting life-style of the population away from the active war front. This series begins in May, 1940 when all England expects an eminent invasion from Germany. You'll learn lots about the British WW2 home-war preparedness.On the other hand, FOYLE'S WAR is a series of some of the best 21st century written murder mystery stories ever presented on television--or theater. An interview bonus feature with creator/writer Anthony Horowitz proves that the dual focus--mystery/period drama--was intentional from day one.  The combined perfection is ""jolly good show.""  It's hard to believe--but, 19 episodes comprising 32 hours is simply not enough of ""Foyle's War.""  You'll want to move from #1 through to #19 without stopping to sleep. It's that good.Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is a cop who'd rather be on the war front than investigating crime in Hastings, England.  His cases, almost always murder, are quite involved, and never fail to end with a surprise--or two.  I'll stick my neck out--Foyle's as good as Poirot.  Foyle recruits help from an ex-soldier who lost a leg. Milner (Anthony Howell) manages to do much of Foyle's ""leg-work"" on an artificial limb.Foyle is assigned a female driver, ""Sam"" for Samantha Stewart. She's a gorgeous red-head with a winning, million-dollar smile.  Sam is as much fun watching in the series as her real name indicates--Honeysuckle Weeks (The Rag Nymph; Catherine Cookson book/movie classic, recommended!) She wins ""Miss Congeniality"" of the 1940s decade.Perfect attention is given to the period details; sets, costumes, vehicles, architecture, even down to  NO yellow road lines.Both Foyle and Sam speak volumes of dialogue with nothing but facial expressions. Their performances are nothing short of superb. Perfection.Additional guest cast members of each episode are well-known stars in their own right--following the tradition of some of the top Masterpiece Theatre productions. It is understood that Foyle will continue in a NEW post-war mystery suspense scheduled for perhaps a 2010 airing.Closed Captioning provides for the hearing impaired and those of us who struggle with some British accents and slang.  The set has cast filmographies on all the top regular and guest stars.""FOYLE'S WAR"" is to British mystery what ""THE PALLISERS"" is to British political drama, OR what ""MONARCH OF THE GLEN"" is to Scottish Highland drama. After you've experienced Foyle's War, I recommend either of the other 2 series.Foyle's War Episodes (Remember: EACH LIKE A MOVIE IN ITSELF):*  The German Woman  October27, 2002*  The White Feather

Despite his character being a man of few words type, his dedication to truth, but above that compassion, shines through in each episode.  I can't tell the many times his lines have given me goose bumps due to his goodness.  The writer Anthony Horowitz has done a brilliant job both on the ethical front, but also with intricate and detailed Agatha Christie like plots.  All the characters are extremely well done.

I especially appreciate the empathy that Horowitz (and his onstage surrogate, Michael Kitchen as Foyle) expresses towards villains (except the most wicked), victims, social outcasts, and the enemy during a time of fear, hate, prejudice, and propaganda.",5,Superb detective series grounded in history,1320192000,"11 2, 2011",2011,760,"['Foyle', 'War', 'superb', 'period', 'detective', 'series', 'firmly', 'grounded', 'events', 'environment', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Britain', 'Wartime', 'social', 'political', 'issues', 'intertwine', 'police', 'work', 'personal', 'lives', 'characters', 'Series', 'creator', 'writer', 'Anthony', 'Horowitz', 'scripted', 'compelling', 'stories', 'historic', 'scenes', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'very', 'believable', 'personalities', 'terrific', 'crew', 'cast', 'including', 'amazing', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'bring', 'Horowitz', 'stories', 'personalities', 'life', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'empathy', 'Horowitz', 'onstage', 'surrogate', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'Foyle', 'towards', 'villains', 'most', 'wicked', 'victims', 'social', 'outcasts', 'enemy', 'time', 'fear', 'hate', 'prejudice', 'propaganda']",Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day

He embodies just the right mix of compassion and no-nonsense efficiency.  The backdrop of WWII is skilfully integrated into the storyline and makes it much more interesting by injecting murky moral and ethical dilemmas not neatly dispatched at the end of each episodes.  Some of the scenes are just searing - the scene in one of the earlier episodes where a father asks Foyle to let his son (David Lane) out of police custody so that they can go and rescue their boys from Dunkirk and promises to bring him back is absolutely remarkable in capturing the competing interests of the father, the war effort and the law.

That, plus the fact that everything about the acting, directing, production, etc., of this exceptional series appealed to me so strongly that I ordered the Series 1 - 5 set through an Amazon Seller immediately.At home, I have an excellent Panasonic G15, connected to two different DVD players. Because the Foyle's War series DVDs are not BluRay, I played the first three episodes on my equally excellent Denon ""standard"" format DVD player. Oddly, Episode 1 looked just fine, but Episodes 2 and 3 looked faded and ""washed-out"".  Then I switched over to my Panasonic BluRay DVD player and played all three of the these episodes.  On the BluRay player, all three looked just fine, fully focused, and with good color saturation.This is a mystery to me. There should be no difference in quality, but there definitely is.

Foyle wants to fight in the war, but is trapped in his role as DCS.  Gradually he comes to accept his fate, as the characters around him grow to depend upon him - his sergeant and his driver.  Both blossom under his quiet leadership.  Kitchen shines as the understated DCS Foyle, but the supporting cast of Howell (Sgt Milner) and Weeks (Sam Stewart) sometimes steals the show.  Weeks plays a woefully misplaced mechanic who is rescued by Foyle's need for a driver.  She's the very definition of sweetness and I had a terrible crush on her when the show first aired.  Howell plays a wounded vet who rediscovers his purposefulness in life on the police force as the loyal and capable Sergeant Milner.  The stories are as much about the history of England and the trials of the people who lived during the period as it is about the mysteries that Foyle must solve.  That is what makes this police drama special.Update: there may be some confusion about this set and season 7.  Set 4 includes seasons 4 and 5, while set 5 covers the three episodes from season 6.

Foyle's War, however, is in a class all by itself, wonderfully crafted during the early years of WWII. Not only does Foyle's struggle to fight the war of crime, but he is immersed and surrounded in the mire of the war in which his country finds itself and how it affects the humans who endure it cruelties.From the early onset of the series, the difficulties and heartaches of war are clearly focused upon and not glossed over. The episodes are wonderfully crafted, as well as the interwoven stories of a different kind of war -- that is one of a personal nature where one kills a single human not for king and country, but for personal gain, greed, and pure hatred. Foyle is by all means the ultimate man with the stiff upper lip mentality. He says very little, you can be assured, unless it's necessary to say. The remainder of the time he ponders, deducts, and keeps a tight lip on his own emotions, though his facial expressions and body language reveal his every thought.
