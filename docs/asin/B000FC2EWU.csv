Last Quarter is a tragic supernatual love story about lost love, life, death, and rebirth. The cinematography and music are high-quality and beautiful. The acting is even better than most other Japanese movies I've seen. The actors fit the characters very well. I was close to crying at some points of the movie, and the characters are realistic enough that I could relate to them well. I wasn't bored for even a moment while watching Last Quarter. It is a movie I would watch again and again, and I recommend it to anyone who who is interested in it.",5,Excellent movie that is beautifully made...,1259971200,"12 5, 2009",2009,666,"['bought', 'movie', 'am', 'fan', 'Hyde', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'Hyde', 'fan', 'Last', 'Quarter', 'tragic', 'supernatual', 'love', 'story', 'lost', 'love', 'life', 'death', 'rebirth', 'cinematography', 'music', 'are', 'high-quality', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'even', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'Japanese', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'actors', 'fit', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'close', 'crying', 'points', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'realistic', 'could', 'relate', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'bored', 'even', 'moment', 'watching', 'Last', 'Quarter', 'movie', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'who', 'interested']",Last Quarter

While his is quite good, he's not the star.  It's more of an ensemble piece, and everyone does a great job.  The fact that it's a first rate ghost story, with Shinto/Buddhist overtones is a plus!

987595,AKCY6EK2ZLV7A,B000FC2EWU,Sarah,"[0, 0]","Also known as The Last Quarter. This is one of Ai Yazawa's mangas that was made in 1998-1999 and is only 3 volumes long. It is a story about a girl named Mizuki, who doesn't have the greatest family background as her mother committed suicide when she was very young due to the fact that Mizuki's father had cheated on her. Mizuki doesn't really like her father and her step-mother eventhough her step-mother tries to be nice to her all the time.On Mizuki's 19th birthday, she is having a great time until she finds out that her boyfriend is cheating on her with her bestfriend. She runs away from the party only to find that somewhere she can hear a beautiful song. She follows it and there she finds a musician named Adam, who is 20 years old. He said he was from England and is just visiting Japan for a couple of weeks. When Mizuki decided to leave, shes surprised to find that Adam asks her to stay.As the days go on, Mizuki decides that she is in love with Adam. She withdraws from her private life i.e. she stops going to school and going to her part time job. When Adam invites her to live at his house, she stops going home. One day, she comes home and Adam and his belongings have dissapeared from the house. All of a sudden her cell phone rings. It was Adam. Mizuki is a bit surprised he had her cell phone number since she never gave it out to him. He apologizes for leaving and tells her he would take her with him and all she had to do was meet him at a junction. She, then, runs home and packs all her belongings and runs to meet him at the junction. When she gets there, Adam is standing across the street and eventhough its a red light, she decided to run to Adam.*May contain a possible spoiler ahead*While this was going on, her ex boyfriend was walking the streets with his friend. He was trying to look for Mizuki whom he could not locate for the past few days. He wanted to apologize to her for what he had done. He saw her running across the street about to be hit by a truck. He runs to her...but it was too late. She gets hit by the car (or truck?) and all of a sudden, Adam ""dissapears"".*SPOILERS ENDED*This story is about love, lost souls, purgatory, waiting souls and reincarnation.I never read the manga but I really am going to try to find it online (since it was never translated to English). I think the movie definitely had the potential to be more interesting than it was...that's why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I want to read the manga because I love Ai Yazawa and I think she is a great mangaka so the manga must've been a 100 times better.",4,A magical movie.,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,2585,"['Also', 'known', 'Last', 'Quarter', 'one', 'Ai', 'Yazawa', 'mangas', 'was', 'made', '1998-1999', 'only', '3', 'volumes', 'long', 'story', 'girl', 'named', 'Mizuki', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'greatest', 'family', 'background', 'mother', 'committed', 'suicide', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'due', 'fact', 'Mizuki', 'father', 'had', 'cheated', 'Mizuki', ""n't"", 'really', 'father', 'step-mother', 'step-mother', 'tries', 'be', 'nice', 'time.On', 'Mizuki', '19th', 'birthday', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'out', 'boyfriend', 'cheating', 'bestfriend', 'away', 'party', 'only', 'find', 'somewhere', 'can', 'hear', 'beautiful', 'song', 'musician', 'named', 'Adam', 'who', '20', 'years', 'old', 'said', 'was', 'England', 'just', 'visiting', 'Japan', 'couple', 'weeks', 'When', 'Mizuki', 'decided', 'leave', 'shes', 'surprised', 'find', 'Adam', 'stay.As', 'days', 'go', 'Mizuki', 'love', 'Adam', 'private', 'life', 'i.e', 'going', 'school', 'going', 'part', 'time', 'job', 'When', 'Adam', 'live', 'house', 'going', 'home', 'One', 'day', 'home', 'Adam', 'belongings', 'have', 'dissapeared', 'house', 'sudden', 'her', 'cell', 'phone', 'rings', 'was', 'Adam', 'Mizuki', 'bit', 'surprised', 'had', 'cell', 'phone', 'number', 'never', 'gave', 'out', 'leaving', 'would', 'take', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'meet', 'junction', 'then', 'home', 'belongings', 'runs', 'meet', 'junction', 'When', 'there', 'Adam', 'standing', 'street', 'eventhough', 'red', 'light', 'decided', 'run', 'Adam', '*May', 'contain', 'possible', 'spoiler', 'was', 'going', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'walking', 'streets', 'friend', 'was', 'trying', 'look', 'Mizuki', 'whom', 'could', 'not', 'locate', 'past', 'few', 'days', 'wanted', 'apologize', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'saw', 'running', 'street', 'be', 'hit', 'truck', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'hit', 'car', 'truck', 'sudden', 'Adam', 'dissapears', '*SPOILERS', 'ENDED*This', 'story', 'love', 'lost', 'souls', 'purgatory', 'waiting', 'souls', 'reincarnation.I', 'never', 'read', 'manga', 'really', 'am', 'going', 'try', 'find', 'was', 'never', 'translated', 'English', 'think', 'movie', 'definitely', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'was', 'why', 'only', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'want', 'read', 'manga', 'love', 'Ai', 'Yazawa', 'think', 'great', 'mangaka', 'manga', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', '100', 'times', 'better']",Last Quarter
