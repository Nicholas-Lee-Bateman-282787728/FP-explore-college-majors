An outstanding video for all the fans and no-necessarily-fans of the NBA and Magic. Extremely well filmed and narrated -voice of Danny Glover-, this is much much more than just a sports video. I have it on &quot;my golden shelf&quot;. If you are a lover of the game or just curious about it or about him, you can't miss this one.",5,Still showtime...,970531200,"10 3, 2000",2000,430,"['have', 'one', '1994', 'watch', 'time', 'time', 'always', 'get', 'same', 'good', 'feeling', 'outstanding', 'video', 'fans', 'no-necessarily-fans', 'NBA', 'Magic', 'Extremely', 'well', 'filmed', 'narrated', '-voice', 'Danny', 'Glover-', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'sports', 'video', 'have', 'quot', 'golden', 'shelf', 'quot', 'are', 'lover', 'game', 'just', 'curious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one']",Magic Johnson - Always Showtime VHS

460627,A2IS16K96YSFDV,630533790X,Eric Mayforth,"[3, 3]","Magic Johnson was the best point guard ever to play the game of basketball.  He was a leader and champion at all levels of the sport, winning titles in high school, college, and the NBA.  ""Always Showtime"" is narrated by Danny Glover and looks back at Magic's career, starting in childhood and high school and then moving on to his years at Michigan State and with the Los Angeles Lakers.The included footage of Johnson's career is stellar, and interspersed throughout the story are comments by family members, coaches, teammates, and rivals.  Also included is Johnson's February 1992 jersey retirement ceremony at The Forum.This DVD set contains three full-length games.  No games from the peak of Magic's career in the mid-to-late Eighties are included, but all three are memorable--Johnson's first game as a pro in October 1979; Game 6 of the 1980 NBA Finals, in which Magic led the Lakers to their first of five titles in the decade; and the 1992 NBA All-Star game, which Johnson played three months after he announced he was HIV-positive.  Viewers of the 1980 game will be surprised at how much running and fast breaking was done in a Finals game back then, and the '92 All-Star game was memorable for the three 3-pointers Magic hit at the end of the game.The set would be a solid addition to any DVD collection of NBA history.",4,Good Retrospective of a Magic Career,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,1332,"['Magic', 'Johnson', 'was', 'best', 'point', 'guard', 'ever', 'play', 'game', 'basketball', 'was', 'leader', 'champion', 'levels', 'sport', 'winning', 'titles', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'NBA', 'Always', 'Showtime', 'narrated', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'back', 'Magic', 'career', 'starting', 'childhood', 'high', 'school', 'then', 'moving', 'years', 'Michigan', 'State', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Lakers.The', 'included', 'footage', 'Johnson', 'career', 'stellar', 'interspersed', 'story', 'are', 'comments', 'family', 'members', 'coaches', 'teammates', 'rivals', 'Also', 'included', 'Johnson', 'February', '1992', 'jersey', 'retirement', 'ceremony', 'Forum.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'contains', 'three', 'full-length', 'games', 'games', 'peak', 'Magic', 'career', 'mid-to-late', 'Eighties', 'are', 'included', 'three', 'are', 'memorable', 'Johnson', 'first', 'game', 'pro', 'October', '1979', 'Game', '6', '1980', 'NBA', 'Finals', 'Magic', 'led', 'Lakers', 'first', 'five', 'titles', 'decade', '1992', 'NBA', 'All-Star', 'game', 'Johnson', 'played', 'three', 'months', 'announced', 'was', 'HIV-positive', 'Viewers', '1980', 'game', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'running', 'fast', 'breaking', 'was', 'done', 'Finals', 'game', 'back', 'then', ""'92"", 'All-Star', 'game', 'was', 'memorable', 'three', '3-pointers', 'Magic', 'hit', 'end', 'game.The', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'solid', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'NBA', 'history']",Magic Johnson - Always Showtime VHS
