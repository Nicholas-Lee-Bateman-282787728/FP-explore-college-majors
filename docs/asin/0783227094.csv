The plot is sort of wacky and cartoonish, too. Major Bison (Raul Julia) has created a new force of evil called Bison troopers and has captured a number of soldiers and nurses from the Allied Nations. The goofy part is that he is holding them ransom for $20,000,000,000 and they have three days to live. If you're gonna do that, ya might as well kill them or ask for world domination! You'll never get that much! At the same time, he has taken Colonel Guile's-AN soldier-(Jean-Claude Van Damme) friend and attempted to turn him into a killing monster. Guile, angrily and vengefully, goes to recover the hostages and kick son of a bi***'s Bison's a** so hard the next Bison wannabe will feel it (quote Colonel Guile).

Not only is that unprofessional, but it's almost unfair, considering not much of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; storyline had been established. Even so, it's not very good, but still not as bad as many have said.The acting is poor, for the most part. Ming-Na Wen(Chun-Li) and the late Raul Julia(M. Bison)play their roles well, but most of the other performances are poor. In fact, it seems like the producer sent his agents out to find brawlers, porn stars and martial artists just to save a few bucks. That may sound like a joke, but it's not.The story isn't very good either. We basically have a cheesy modern-age World War 2 that takes place in &quot;Shadoloo City&quot;. This, obviously, isn't a a movie that you should think about while watching, though that may be tough.Looking back at my review, I realize this movie is as bad as many have said. I stand corrected for saying earlier that this movie isn't that bad.I still have a VHS copy of this movie, but only because I'm a fan of the video games. for an actual(although not excellent)SF movie buy &quot;Street Fighter 2: The Animated movie&quot;.

57853,A2DK2OY6R3WICK,0783227094,C.W. Fitch,"[9, 13]","Okay...quick show of hands!  How many Street Fighter video game nuts actually went to see this movie in theaters when it first came out back in '94?  (Yeah, me too...)I'm sure there are quite a few of you who thought that it was one of the most disappointing experiences of your movie-going career.  I'll go ahead and include myself in that category.  I lost count of the number of times I not only groaned, but looked at my watch during this ""film"", waiting for the thing to finally end.  I'm a BIG fan of the Street Fighter video games (heck, I've owned every one at one time or another), but this...man alive, I'll tell ya.  Let me count the ways not only Street Fighter fans, but Van Damme fans, martial arts fans, and fans of action movies in general should stay away from it.  Now, granted, there is a LOT of talent in this flick; the late, great Raul Julia as the main villain, Bison (oh, sorry...M. Bison), Ming-Na (Joy Luck Club, ER) as Chun-Li (or Chun-Li ZANG...sigh), Wes Studi (Geronimo, Mystery Men) as Sagat, Grand L. Bush (In the Heat of the Night) as Balrog, etc., etc., and of course, Van Damme as Col. William (William...?) Guile.  But that's about all this movie has going for it.  You can forget what you know about the Street Fighter characters from the games, because here, ALL of their stories are different.  (Well, except for Bison's...)  How different?  Well, for starters, Ryu and Ken are small-time thieves, Chun-Li's not an Interpol operative, but a TV reporter (with Balrog and Honda as her camera crew...oy.), Dhalsim's a doctor who works for Bison...you get the idea; you'll just have to see the rest of the differences for yourself.But that's not even what bothered me!  This is a movie that tries to pass itself off as a decent action/martial arts flick, and manages to do neither.  If the movie's called ""Street Fighter"", wouldn't you think there would have to be at least ONE STREET FIGHT in it?!  Well, apparently the director didn't think so.  It's painfully obvious that the ones responsible for this movie were doing nothing but trying to cash in on a video game franchise at the peak of its popularity.  They could've named this movie ""Banana-Flavored Undershirts"" and it wouldn't have made a bit of difference.  The action scenes are frightengly dull, the fights (what few there actually were) were poorly choreographed, and even while trying to add a couple of the characters' ""special moves"" to the mix, couldn't even get THAT right.  (One of my particular ""favorites"" is the ""steel cage match"" between Ryu and Vega, where the crowd actually chants ""No weapons!"" before the fight starts.  Gimme a break.)  The special effects are cheesy.  The acting is incredibly overdone, especially by Julia, which is disheartening considering what a superb actor he was.  It looks like at least he made the most of it, though.The whole thing just has a bad look, sound, and taste to it.  (And don't even get me started on the way everyone pronounces ""Ryu"".

57857,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,0783227094,DarthJustice,"[8, 9]","Whenever I think of video game movies, I always think of only three movies: Super Mario Brothers, Street Fighter, and Double Dragon. Perhaps because these were the first three made or perhaps because I loved all three as a kid. Either way, of those three, it's Street Fighter I seem to always think of the most as far as these kind of movies go.Street Fighter: The Movie came out in 1994, a year after the release of Super Mario Brothers. Let's just be upfront in saying it's no where near being an Oscar worthy movie. It's probably not even really ""good"", at that. It's a somewhat cheesy or campy movie (but not as much as SMB and no where near as much as Double Dragon). But I've always really enjoyed the movie.So what is the plot of the movie? This is one place I think it hurt itself with a lot of Street Fighter fans. As was once said, for a movie called Street Fighter....there's a glaring lack of street fighting, much less a tournament. I could have easily seen the movie be your standard martial arts film in that sense had they made it a bit more like the games. However, in the movie, Bison is as he is in the games: a power mad dictator out for world domination. Opposing him is the Allied Nations with Guile commanding the army. And that's basically the plot. Bison has taken a large group of people hostage and has given the world 72 hours to hand him $20 billion in ransom while the main characters set out to stop him and rescue the hostages (though they don't all come together until towards the end of the movie).Many of the major characters from the games out at the time are in the movie as well. Ryu and Ken are a couple of con artists who rip off criminals, Sagat and Vega, both former cage fighters, operate as arms dealers for Bison, Chun Li, out to avenge her father, Balrog, who is one of the more major departures from his game counterpart, and E. Honda work as reporters, and Guile, like his game counterpart, is after Bison partially to avenge his friend Charlie who is  combined with Blanka from the game as in the movie, Charlie IS Blanka. Zangief, though not like in the game, works for Bison.I bought the blu-ray ""Extreme Edition"" version of the movie. Admittedly I never owned the DVD so I can't compare. But I thought the image quality was nice. I have no complaints there. There's several special features but so far I've only watched the deleted scenes. There's unfortunately only two of them and both center around Chun Li.The only ""big name"" people in the movie are Raul Julia as M. Bison and Jean Claude Van Damme who plays Colonel William F. Guile. Both give good performances (as good as it can be given the circumstances). Raul Julia definitely takes the cake though as my favorite performance of the movie. It was clear he was enjoying himself with the role. It's only sad because Raul Julia died not long after the movie came out. I remember always seeing the ""For Raul. Vaya con dios"" at the end but never realizing what it meant (both with RJ's death and I didn't know Spanish at the time--it means go with God). Now that I do, I felt a twinge of sadness as it appeared and the credits rolled.Another thing I've heard people didn't like about the movie is they changed the central character. In the games, Ryu is the central/main character while in the movie, it's Guile. While Guile is my favorite character (in both the games and movie), I can understand.All in all, can you really say Street Fighter is a ""good"" movie? Probably not. But something about it I can't quite put my finger on has always made me really enjoy the movie. Truth be told, it's probably my favorite video game movie.",4,Definitely One Of The Better Made Early Video Game Movies...Though That Might Not Be Saying Much,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,3639,"['Whenever', 'think', 'video', 'game', 'movies', 'always', 'think', 'only', 'three', 'movies', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Brothers', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'Double', 'Dragon', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'first', 'three', 'made', 'perhaps', 'loved', 'three', 'kid', 'way', 'three', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'seem', 'always', 'think', 'most', 'as', 'far', 'kind', 'movies', 'go.Street', 'Fighter', 'Movie', 'came', 'out', '1994', 'year', 'release', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Brothers', 'Let', 'just', 'be', 'upfront', 'saying', 'where', 'near', 'being', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'movie', 'probably', 'not', 'even', 'really', 'good', 'somewhat', 'cheesy', 'campy', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'SMB', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'much', 'Double', 'Dragon', ""'ve"", 'always', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie.So', 'what', 'plot', 'movie', 'one', 'place', 'think', 'lot', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'fans', 'was', 'once', 'said', 'movie', 'called', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'glaring', 'lack', 'street', 'fighting', 'much', 'less', 'tournament', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'seen', 'movie', 'be', 'standard', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'sense', 'had', 'made', 'bit', 'more', 'games', 'However', 'movie', 'Bison', 'games', 'power', 'mad', 'dictator', 'world', 'domination', 'Opposing', 'Allied', 'Nations', 'Guile', 'commanding', 'army', 'basically', 'plot', 'Bison', 'taken', 'large', 'group', 'people', 'hostage', 'given', 'world', '72', 'hours', 'hand', '20', 'billion', 'ransom', 'main', 'characters', 'set', 'out', 'stop', 'rescue', 'hostages', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'come', 'together', 'towards', 'end', 'movie', '.Many', 'major', 'characters', 'games', 'out', 'time', 'are', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Ryu', 'Ken', 'are', 'couple', 'con', 'artists', 'who', 'rip', 'criminals', 'Sagat', 'Vega', 'former', 'cage', 'fighters', 'operate', 'arms', 'dealers', 'Bison', 'Chun', 'Li', 'avenge', 'father', 'Balrog', 'who', 'one', 'more', 'major', 'departures', 'game', 'counterpart', 'E.', 'Honda', 'work', 'reporters', 'Guile', 'game', 'counterpart', 'Bison', 'partially', 'avenge', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'who', 'combined', 'Blanka', 'game', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'IS', 'Blanka', 'Zangief', 'not', 'game', 'Bison.I', 'bought', 'blu-ray', 'Extreme', 'Edition', 'version', 'movie', 'Admittedly', 'never', 'owned', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'thought', 'image', 'quality', 'was', 'nice', 'have', 'complaints', 'there', 'several', 'special', 'features', 'so', 'far', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'two', 'center', 'Chun', 'Li.The', 'only', 'big', 'name', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'M.', 'Bison', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'who', 'Colonel', 'William', 'F.', 'Guile', 'Both', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'circumstances', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'definitely', 'cake', 'favorite', 'performance', 'movie', 'was', 'clear', 'was', 'enjoying', 'role', 'only', 'sad', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'died', 'not', 'long', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'remember', 'always', 'seeing', 'Raul', 'Vaya', 'con', 'dios', 'end', 'never', 'realizing', 'what', 'meant', 'RJ', 'death', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Spanish', 'time', 'go', 'God', 'Now', 'do', 'felt', 'twinge', 'sadness', 'appeared', 'credits', 'rolled.Another', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'changed', 'central', 'character', 'games', 'Ryu', 'central/main', 'character', 'movie', 'Guile', 'Guile', 'favorite', 'character', 'games', 'movie', 'can', 'understand.All', 'can', 'really', 'say', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'good', 'movie', 'Probably', 'not', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'always', 'made', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'probably', 'favorite', 'video', 'game', 'movie']",N/A

I would be ashamed to have my name attached to this trash. Indeed, it was such a bad movie that I was embarassed to watch it -- and I was all by myself when I watched it.This is the kind of movie where you actually feel like your IQ has been lowered after watching it.

The result, a bomb.Fortunately, Street Fighter is not even as bad as the 2nd Mortal Kombat movie, but it is still pretty poor.  I have tried really really hard to enjoy this movie, especially since just about all the Street Fighter characters are in the film and stay fairly close to their video game identities, but the ridiculousy dumb humor, crappy acting, and lack of any good-looking action forces the film to suffer.  Jean Claude even looks weak in this film, but compared to the other actors, they still manage to make him look good.  The story is weak too, with a lot of nonsense to kill time in what is already a short movie, not even an hour and half.  The only highlight is the fight between Bison and Guile (Van Damme), where they actually use some moves from the video game such as Bison's elevation ability and Guile's flash kicks.  Unfortunately, editing doesn't make the fight look very real at all.I only like this movie because I love the video game, and this is the only movie made with these guys, that is not animated.

They were probably right, but he wrote the script anyway...and he only had one night to do it.  Perhaps he should have asked for two nights.  Nevertheless, here we have the infamous live-action version of Street Fighter on DVD in a lavish Widescreen Collector's Edition, packed with a plethora of bonus features, including:  trailers; TV promos; behind the scenes footage; storyboards; deleted scenes; video game footage; movie poster art; Chun-Li's news footage; video game character art; `The Making of Street Fighter' featurette; and even a running commentary by the aforementioned writer/director, Steven de Souza.  Never has a motion picture so universally despised received such an extraordinary DVD treatment!Street Fighter may not be as awful as some people think, but it certainly isn't very good.  The plot is meandering and hard to follow, and the characters' motivations are not always clear.  It's too often silly and only occasionally exciting, but it's not consistently funny enough to be considered a comedy, and not dramatic enough to be considered an action movie.  The film's worst flaw is that it doesn't stay true to its source material.  General M. Bison is a drug lord turned power mad dictator who is holding sixty-three ""Allied Nations"" relief workers in a ""hostage pit"" in his secret underground base in Shadaloo, Southeast Asia.  The smartly-dressed megalomaniac demands that a staggering ransom of twenty billion dollars be deposited into his Swiss bank account within three days or the hapless hostages will die.  Though he lacks the Psycho Power of his video game counterpart, the impudent General plans to use the ransom money to build Bisonopolis (complete with a food court) and, of course, take over the world.  Chun-Li Zang is a reporter for GNT World News and her news crew consists of Balrog, the boxer, and Edmond Honda, the Hawaiian sumo wrestler.  Colonel William F. Guile (the main character here) is the blue-camouflaged A.N. military commander who has an American flag tattooed on his shoulder even though he's Belgian.  Cammy works for Guile, not for Bison.  Ken and Ryo--the stars of the video game--are portrayed as thieving con men who sell ping-pong ball guns to bad guys...like Bison's skinny one-eyed arms supplier, Sagat.  Zangief, the Russian, is depicted as a complete moron.  And Dhalsim is not an Indian monk and Yoga master, but a scientist who is forced, by Bison, to turn Guile's friend, Charlie Blanka, into a mindless, orange-haired Hulk-like killing machine by injecting colorful liquids into him and making him watch horrific videos (like this one) in an ""incubation chamber.""  Dr. Dhalsim has a full head of thick black hair until near the end of the picture, when he suddenly and inexplicably shows up completely bald.The movie does have its moments though.  Ra&uacute;l Juli&aacute; is terrifically entertaining as General Bison, even if he is too gaunt to be believable as the powerful fighter from the arcade game.  There are some clever lines like: ""For you, the day Bison graced your village was the most important day of your life.  For me, it was Tuesday."" And Guile's speech to the A.N. troops just before they mount an amphibious attack on Bison's lair is pretty inspiring, despite the fact that Jean-Claude Van Damme seems to have a lot of trouble speaking the English language.  There's also a very impressive explosion near the end of the film.  Still, proper representations of the Street Fighter characters can only be found in animated form (seeStreet Fighter II: The Animated MovieandStreet Fighter II V: The Collection).",3,"""I'm the Repo Man, and you're out of business!""",1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,3742,"['ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'video', 'game', 'what', 'told', 'writer/director', 'Steven', 'Souza', 'when', 'took', 'daunting', 'project', 'were', 'probably', 'right', 'wrote', 'script', 'anyway', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'night', 'do', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'asked', 'two', 'nights', 'Nevertheless', 'here', 'have', 'infamous', 'live-action', 'version', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'DVD', 'lavish', 'Widescreen', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'packed', 'plethora', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'trailers', 'TV', 'promos', 'scenes', 'footage', 'storyboards', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'video', 'game', 'footage', 'movie', 'poster', 'art', 'Chun-Li', 'news', 'footage', 'video', 'game', 'character', 'art', 'Making', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'featurette', 'even', 'running', 'commentary', 'aforementioned', 'writer/director', 'Steven', 'Souza', 'Never', 'motion', 'picture', 'so', 'universally', 'despised', 'received', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'awful', 'people', 'think', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'plot', 'meandering', 'hard', 'follow', 'characters', 'motivations', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'clear', 'too', 'often', 'silly', 'only', 'occasionally', 'exciting', 'not', 'consistently', 'funny', 'enough', 'be', 'considered', 'comedy', 'not', 'dramatic', 'enough', 'be', 'considered', 'action', 'movie', 'film', 'worst', 'flaw', ""n't"", 'stay', 'true', 'source', 'material', 'General', 'M.', 'Bison', 'drug', 'lord', 'turned', 'power', 'mad', 'dictator', 'who', 'holding', 'sixty-three', 'Allied', 'Nations', 'relief', 'workers', 'hostage', 'pit', 'secret', 'underground', 'base', 'Shadaloo', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'smartly-dressed', 'megalomaniac', 'staggering', 'ransom', 'twenty', 'billion', 'dollars', 'be', 'deposited', 'Swiss', 'bank', 'account', 'three', 'days', 'hapless', 'hostages', 'will', 'die', 'Psycho', 'Power', 'video', 'game', 'counterpart', 'impudent', 'General', 'use', 'ransom', 'money', 'build', 'Bisonopolis', 'complete', 'food', 'court', 'course', 'take', 'world', 'Chun-Li', 'Zang', 'reporter', 'GNT', 'World', 'News', 'news', 'crew', 'Balrog', 'boxer', 'Edmond', 'Honda', 'Hawaiian', 'sumo', 'wrestler', 'Colonel', 'William', 'F.', 'Guile', 'main', 'character', 'here', 'blue-camouflaged', 'A.N', 'military', 'commander', 'who', 'American', 'flag', 'tattooed', 'shoulder', 'even', 'Belgian', 'Cammy', 'Guile', 'not', 'Bison', 'Ken', 'Ryo', 'stars', 'video', 'game', 'are', 'portrayed', 'thieving', 'con', 'men', 'who', 'sell', 'ping-pong', 'ball', 'guns', 'bad', 'guys', 'Bison', 'skinny', 'one-eyed', 'arms', 'supplier', 'Sagat', 'Zangief', 'Russian', 'depicted', 'complete', 'moron', 'Dhalsim', 'not', 'Indian', 'monk', 'Yoga', 'master', 'scientist', 'who', 'forced', 'Bison', 'turn', 'Guile', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'Blanka', 'mindless', 'orange-haired', 'Hulk-like', 'killing', 'machine', 'injecting', 'colorful', 'liquids', 'making', 'watch', 'horrific', 'videos', 'one', 'incubation', 'chamber', 'Dr.', 'Dhalsim', 'full', 'head', 'thick', 'black', 'hair', 'end', 'picture', 'when', 'suddenly', 'inexplicably', 'up', 'completely', 'bald.The', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'Ra', 'uacute', 'Juli', 'aacute', 'terrifically', 'entertaining', 'General', 'Bison', 'even', 'too', 'gaunt', 'be', 'believable', 'powerful', 'fighter', 'arcade', 'game', 'are', 'clever', 'lines', 'day', 'Bison', 'graced', 'village', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'day', 'life', 'was', 'Tuesday', 'Guile', 'speech', 'A.N', 'troops', 'just', 'mount', 'amphibious', 'attack', 'Bison', 'lair', 'pretty', 'inspiring', 'fact', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'have', 'lot', 'trouble', 'speaking', 'English', 'language', 'also', 'very', 'impressive', 'explosion', 'end', 'film', 'Still', 'proper', 'representations', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'characters', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'animated', 'form', 'seeStreet', 'Fighter', 'II', 'Animated', 'MovieandStreet', 'Fighter', 'II', 'V', 'Collection']",N/A

The video game Street Fighter II was all the rage, and there was money to be made on the craze.  It's not JCVD's fault that there was a near conspiracy among the director and cast to sabotage the entire wretched production.  Nearly everything except for costume design is horrible, and I can't express it another way.  Horrible.  ALMOST worst of all is the forced product placement for Capcom's logo and the Street Fighter II game console.

Banks,"[0, 0]","Having viewed this film, I immediately fell in love with it being that I'm an avid action adventure and Van Damme fan but, as I delved more into the Street Fighter story, I can see why this film did not make it. First of all, Ryu (Byron Mann in the film) is supposed to be the title character and Bison is supposed to be much more powerful than he is although the late Julia does capture most of the essence of his maniacal character. Most of the action does not take place until the end which takes away from the basic premise of the film. With Ryu and Ken demoted to co-stars and most of the villains reduced to henchman only status, the real standouts are Van Damme as Guile and Ming-Na as Chun Li. Last and certainly not least, the special effects. Now Universal is one of the most popular and successful production companies of all time so I know they could have afforded to at least let viewers see half of the powers from the game.

Yes, I have played Streetfighter 2 on my cellphone many times after first buying it as an app in the summer of 2010.  I decided to give this movie a chance and watched it throughout its entirety.  Some of the pros: Jean- Claude Van Damme, Kylie Minogue, and Raul Julia are some of the celebrities who star in ""Streetfighter"".  Additionally, the a variety of the following game characters were included in this movie: Ryu, E. Honda, Blanka, Guile, Ken,  Chun Li, Zangief (this character also referenced in the 2012 ""Wreck It Ralph film), Dhalsin, Vega, Balrog,Sagat, T. Hawk, Dee Jay,  Cammy, and M. Bison. It is also clear that Jean Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia did their best to keep the plot afloat with their character of roles of Guile and M. Bison.The cons: The film could have been made stronger by including some of the game characters being included to help Guile carry out his work.  It was as if Guile was made the leader to do most of the fighting  with occasional help from Chun Li, Ken, Ryu, and E. Honda.  Including more frequent support combats scenes from T. Hawk, Cammy, E. Honda , Ken, and Ryu could have made the film stronger because of Guile realistically being given the help he needs to implement his mission.  Please know that I do admire the music of Kylie Minogue (thanks to my husband introducing her music to me) and look forward to more creative works from her.  However, I was not use to seeing her as Cammy  and feel that her artistic talents could be better utilized in a science fiction project (such as when she appeared in Dr. Who back in 2007) and/or a fantasy, animation, and/or action/romance type film.  However, my husband felt that Raul Julia's performance as M. Bison was one of the best parts of the Streetfighter film.

57894,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,0783227094,Micheal Hunt,"[1, 1]","It was only a matter or time before the phenomenal video game smash hit was turned into a video game, and when word was out there was to be a live action movie, i don't think anyone really knew what to expect. And once it was out, it made it's money, which was guaranteed, but left a lot of the fans of the game in disappointment at how there favorite video game characters had been portrayed.To those who never played the game, it was a JCVD movie where he led the U.N against the dictatorship of General Bison with 100 other side characters involved. But to those who just dismiss the movie and give it 2 to 4 word reviews, you really need to stand back and look at just how many characters from the game are portrayed into this film. What was it meant to be? 80 mins of nonstop fighting with special effects coming out of there hands?I have to say, for the task that was at hand and the plot of the movie, it's not that bad of a job when asking someone to involve so many characters from a video game and incorporate them into a full length motion picture. I mean, this movie was based on Super Street Fighter 2 and that game had about 16 characters in it. It really came down to the casting of certain characters and costumes that really held this movie back.Jean Claude Van Dame - as Cornell William F Guile. I think half the audience liked the idea he played Guile, and the other half would ask why the muscles from Brussels is playing an American military Cornell? As like any JCVD movies, he has his moments of coolness & his moments of complete lameness.Raul Julia as M. Bison i thought was great casting. Raul really researched dictators like Hitler and Mussolini for this role, and created exactly who Bison was expected to be. I'm not just praising him cause he died just after this movie, no, he is one of the much better actors in this movie that when I think if someone else could have been cast who would be better in this role, then Raul is the one I would say is the #1 choice.Ming-Na as Chun Li I think did a terrible job. It's not so much she didn't look the part, but I think they could have found someone who looked a better Chun-Li, but also her acting from sarcasm to doing her own lame stunt's that look stupid in the movie (hence that roll she did to put a tracking device on the truck) really make you wonder how she got this role in the first place. She plays the role too goofy in most parts, then when she is supposed to be mean, you just don't buy it.Wes Studi I think played a great Sagat. He looked the part, and played it straight. Even tho he was not as tall as Sagat should be, it would be very hard to track down a 7'4 kickboxer to play the role.Jay Tavare I suppose played a decent Vega. Surely there is someone out there that could have done a much better job, but this guy played the character decently and no real complaint about his performance in the movie.Kylie Minogue playing Cammy was the worst choice of the entire movie. She completely killed the character by having no knowledge what-so-ever of who the heck she was supposed to be portraying. And her accent in the film is just enough to make cringe.Byron Mann as Ryu was not quite the right choice, tho he could have been better if he was a little darker and not working with Damian Chapa who really did not suit the role of Ken Masters at all. The two of them where not what you expected out of so many SF2 fans favorite characters. Both of them should have been played by people a bit thicker and didn't look like the comic relief from a stoner movie.Roshan Seth I suppose played Dahlsim as best he could for the way he is written into this movie. Many where disappointed he was not a Yoga master made of rubber shooting flames out his rear end, but for what his role was here, I suppose he did a decent enough job.Grand L. Bush looked the part of Balrog in some parts of the movie, but he did not seem he was the right choice for the character. Balrog should've been much meaner and bulked up. This guy was far from the right choice.Peter Navy Tuiasosopo as E.Honda I will say was a good choice to play the role. Even tho he was Hawaiin in the movie, and the video game he is Japanese, not to forget in real life Peter is Samoan, there probably wouldn't have been a lot of Japanese men of this size that could make this character work on screen.Andrew Bryniarski as Zangief was really horrible choice. It wouldn't have been that hard to find an actual wrestler who stands at about 7 foot in height who looked more the role then this guy does. This guy looks like he is wearing a bad fake beard and wig, and is trying to play the character just as goofy as can be. it really ruins scenes with guys like Raul Julia who give a great performance, and then this guy screws it up with really bad acting.Gregg Rainwater as T.Hawk, why did they even bother? I'm not even going to go on about this one.Miguel A. N&uacute;&ntilde;ez Jr. as Dee Jay was pretty bad as well, the character was written in badly, so i guess it wouldn't matter who played this role.Robert Mammone as Charlie (Blanka) again, another one they should have had a beefed up guy play the role of and make him look somewhat credible then just completely stupid.Kenya Sawada as Captain Sawada - what a memorable character this one was - not. This was supposed to be the introduction of a new character for the video games Capcom was planning to release in an upcoming SF game, but after the fact no one took any notice of him in this movie, I guess the idea was canned.So with very few right choices for the roles of the SF characters, you can see why the movie is not praised by fans of SF2 from being the wrong choice of characters. If it had a balance of the right looks for the role, and everyone on the same level from who is going to play the role seriously, and who is going to portray it as a loony tune, then the results may have varied more in the thumbs up favor.BONUS FEATURES- Boring commentary from the director giving you more information about his background and life then anything to do with the movie.- Trailers to SF4 (big deal)- 2 Deleted Scenes that are worthy of looking at.- The trailer (whoopie)Still, with the negative things I have said about this film, and the things I would have changed, much like Masters Of The Universe, there is just something about the film that makes you want to see it at least once every year or two.

57895,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,0783227094,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[6, 7]","The biggest distinction that ""Street Fighter: the Movie"" holds for me is that it's the first Van Damme picture I ever saw. On a global scale, it was the first video game-film adaptation to turn a buck, which should count for something despite the routine bashing it receives for how shoddily it portrayed the most popular fighting game of the time on the big screen. I was personally never a huge ""Street Fighter"" fan, but while I can certainly spot the plotline unfaithfulness, I can't help but notice just how fun the movie is. It's a poor adaptation and a questionable action movie, but nevertheless a decent teenaged adventure when taken at face value.The story: when the mad warlord General M. Bison (Raul Julia,The Addams Family) is poised to overrun the earth in pursuit of his own personal empire, it will be up to a multi-faceted group of fighters - including Colonel William Guile (Van Damme,Timecop), reporter Chun-Li (Ming Na,Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within), and conmen Ryu Hoshi (Byron Mann,Crying Freeman) and Ken Masters (Damian Chapa) - to stop him.This film is definitely over-cast, comparable toMortal Kombat: Annihilationin terms of saturation. No less than fifteen characters from the original two games - more than half of their combined casts - are featured, resulting in a stifling deficit of character development, since next to none of them have the appropriate amount of screentime for it. The actual casting choices of these characters can also be taken to task, but I'm pleased that - through the admirably accurate costumes and cosmetics - most of the performers at least *look* like their animated counterparts (in some cases, like Robert ""Blanka"" Mammone, you almost wish they didn't). Personalities and backgrounds have been addled with as expected to accommodate the tournament-free premise, but none of them bother me as much as the case of M. Bison: he's the single goofiest part of this whole immature adventure, practically a forerunner toDr. Evil, having been written so comically that it's impossible to consider him threatening even when he's snapping guys' necks or shooting electricity from his fists.The movie never has a problem with pacing, rolling along fittingly enough at a video game's pace and always presenting you with some silly or bombastic event to watch; it's never boring. Sadly, there's not nearly enough fighting going on, and when it does happen it's not that great. It seems amazing that, considering what it's based on, the movie only has a 'round half-dozen fights, depending on your definition of a fight (i.e. I don't consider it a fight when Guile and his team ambush some soldiers and Kylie Minogue does a cool but unnecessary pro wrestling move), and even more amazing how very bland most of them are with Benny Urquidez (Spider-Man) supplying fight choreography. Some of the performers just aren't good, and some of them surprisingly so (is this the same Damian Chapa who rocked the house with Michael Worth inU.S. Seals 2? I hope not!), but other times they just feel stifled. For example, the showdown between Ryu and Vega (Jay Tavare,Pathfinder) was my favorite of the movie, and really felt like it could've gone somewhere were it not for the cramped locker room they were in.Apparently, the critical lashing ""Street Fighter"" received moved Van Damme to choose his future roles more carefully, so in a pinch, I'll accredit every good movie he did subsequently to this minor disappointment. Seeing as this particular franchise hasn't done too well in live-action filmregardless of who's involved, I can't be too hard on this first attempt and will continue to regard it neutrally and enjoy it by accident every few years. Fans of the games who somehow have yet to see the film should avoid it unless they're intentionally looking for something to heckle.",3,"""Quick!

57896,A17J8CYSYGCLEP,0783227094,Movie Dude,"[1, 1]","I had never played any street fighter games until I saw this movie. Plus, I do not usually compare movies based on the video games that inspire them because most of the time the plots are not similar to each other. I found Street Fighter to be a decent action flick. Sure, I have seen beter based-on-video-game movies with martial arts action (Mortal Kombat), but Street Fighter wasn't just terrible like some reviewers say. I'll agree that the acting wasn't all that great. However, Raul Julia did a great job playing the character of M. Bison. Jean-Claude Van Damme has had better roles (Time Cop) but I don't know of any one else who could have played the character of William F. Guile any better.

This is also what the game on which it is based was originally all about - fun rather than violence, parody rather than blood. Unfortunately, the movie attracted mainly people who expected cruel, violent massacre and were angry not to see it - an audience obviously not high enough to see and appreciate dozens of little jokes scattered throughout the movie (there are some, which are quite obvious - such as the parody of Japanese monster movies from the 1950s - and others, which require a more careful look - such as the lovely scene with the drawing - a parody showing Bison as Hitler, with a similar &quot;creative&quot; ambition and similarly ridiculous results!). The script was apparently too good for those who expected more of a violent, nonsensical fight such as &quot;Mortal Kombat the Movie&quot;. However, unlike any other &quot;fighting&quot; films, this one you might show to your kids and people who dislike &quot;fighter&quot; films - that is because Street Fighter is a harmless fighting comedy, without hectolitres of fake blood and without those boring and crude sexual references, rather than a violent fighting action feature.",5,"Wants to be entertaining, not violent",972432000,"10 25, 2000",2000,1350,"['Aside', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'van', 'Damme', 'traditionally', 'wooden', 'performance', 'movie', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'planned', 'funny', 'spoof', 'fighting', 'movies', 'rather', 'cruel', ""beat'em"", 'up', 'also', 'what', 'game', 'based', 'was', 'originally', 'fun', 'rather', 'violence', 'parody', 'rather', 'blood', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'attracted', 'mainly', 'people', 'who', 'expected', 'cruel', 'violent', 'massacre', 'were', 'angry', 'not', 'see', 'audience', 'obviously', 'not', 'high', 'enough', 'see', 'appreciate', 'dozens', 'little', 'jokes', 'scattered', 'movie', 'are', 'are', 'quite', 'obvious', 'such', 'parody', 'Japanese', 'monster', 'movies', '1950s', 'others', 'require', 'more', 'careful', 'look', 'such', 'lovely', 'scene', 'drawing', 'parody', 'showing', 'Bison', 'Hitler', 'similar', 'quot', 'creative', 'quot', 'ambition', 'similarly', 'ridiculous', 'results', 'script', 'was', 'apparently', 'too', 'good', 'who', 'expected', 'more', 'violent', 'nonsensical', 'fight', 'such', 'quot', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'Movie', 'quot', 'However', 'other', 'quot', 'fighting', 'quot', 'films', 'one', 'might', 'show', 'kids', 'people', 'who', 'dislike', 'quot', 'fighter', 'quot', 'films', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'harmless', 'fighting', 'comedy', 'hectolitres', 'fake', 'blood', 'boring', 'crude', 'sexual', 'references', 'rather', 'violent', 'fighting', 'action', 'feature']",N/A

Durham ""Big Evil""","[7, 10]","Being an avid Street Fighter fan, I was outraged at how ridiculously bad this movie was when I saw it in a theater all those yeras ago.  First off I want to set something straight, the original storyline in Street Fighter revolved completely around Ryu and Ken, who were reduced to supporting characters in the film to make Guile the lead, only Guile was the one who was a supporting character originally (I guess they couldn't find a different role for Jean-Claude Van Damme though).  Second, some of the roles they have reversed for the characters, Balrog was a bad guy who worked for Bison, not a good guy, and Dee Jay was a good guy as well.  Now onto the movie itself.  Everything about this film is horrid, the acting is ridiculously bad as is the dialogue which sounds like it was written by an overzealous third grader, and the costumes were laughable.  The late Raul Julia is here in his last film role, and it's a shame that this was his last film considering how great an actor he was.  Van Damme is mind nummingly dull, and other actors who are usually good; Ming-Na (Chun-Li, she voiced Aki in the Final Fantasy movie) and Wes Studi (Sagat) are plain dull as well.  All in all, even if you are a die hard hardcore Street Fighter fan, you will be repulsed by this dismal live action movie.

57902,A27L5L6I7OSV5B,0783227094,Otto Correct,"[5, 5]","For those complaining that its not ""faithful to the source material"" please stop.  It was a video game movie made in the early to mid 90's.  It stars Jean Claude Van Damme.  It was also based on a video game that had NO depth of character or plot.  All you had from the game to write a movie off of was the way the characters looked and one or two sentences from each of them when they won a fight.  I think its pretty reasonable they took some liberties.  You want a ""faithful"" SF movie go buy those anime movies they made after this one.Okay, all that said... I like this movie very much.  No, I did not see it as a kid, I first saw it this year and I'm 26.  No, it is not a GOOD movie at all, but I rate films based on entertainment value and this has it through the roof.  Yeah, its a stupid cheese-fest but its a really FUN cheese-fest that's also fast moving, never boring, and has TONS of personality.  Its kinda like ifMegaforcehad been made in the early 90's and actually gotten half of the one-liners right for a change.This was Raul Julia's final film, and its sad to see an honestly great actor die fairly young like he did.  That said, those who feel his role as Bison was sad and beneath his dignity should pay more attention to his performance in this movie.  He clearly is having an absolute blast as Gen. Bison, hamming it up in a truly delicious way.  Every time he's on screen its a hilarious treat and probably the best bad guy overacting I've seen since Michael Gough's performance inKonga.Julia's performance is the best one, but all the acting is hammy and over the top, but thankfully never so much that it approaches the wink-wink level of irony. Instead, everyone does what they should do, and what always makes these movies more fun -- they play it straight, as if the material were serious and important, but ratchet everything up well above where it should be.  My wife put it well when she said the movie feels ""like a big comic book.""  Sometimes its funny on purpose, most of the time its fun unintentionally, but through and through its fast and entertaining.As far as trying to incorporate the video game elements in, I got a real kick out of how they managed to get everyone in their video game costumes at some point, no matter how crazy the reasons behind the change of outfit.  Ryu and Ken finally get into their karate outfits when they're mistakenly taken in as Bison's new recruits.  Chun-Li dresses in her ridiculous getup from the game as its apparently Bison's fetish outfit of choice for her (LOL!).  Blanka finally appears monstrous as a victim of a genetic super-soldier experiment.  Dhalsim starts out as a normal Indian guy with hair but looks like his video game counterpart after getting his shirt and hair (!!!) burned off.  Balrog just shows up in boxing gear toward the end of the movie with no explanation offered at all (not even in the deleted scenes).For those who might know me or have read some of my other reviews, it might seem weird that I like Street Fighter given my unbridled contempt for other big Hollywood adaptation crapfests like the Transformers movies.  The main difference to me is tone.  Street Fighter is completely ridiculous but creates a world where everything is that way, giving the movie a unified feel (again, ""like a big comic book"" as my wife put it).  Movies like Transformers are just set in the real world, with average people (no character in Street Fighter is portrayed as just a normal everyday guy) doing the dumbest most nonsensical stuff possible.Another difference is the audience respect factor.  Street Fighter is dumb, but its dumb in a silly good natured way.  It knows its dumb but it's heart is in the right place and it invites its audience to get in on the fun.  It doesn't condescend to its audience or treat them as idiots, it revels in its brainlessness and wants you to dig in too.  The Transformers movies are cynical, and people like Michael Bay honestly know how to make a better movie, they just don't care.  They have no respect for their audience, treat them like cavemen, and go about their films in the laziest way possible, thinking if they wave enough explosions and hot chicks in front of our eyes it'll be good enough.  The sad part is, it works.  Plenty of idiots keeping buying tickets, not caring that the filmmakers are being condescending to them and insulting their intelligence, so they keep getting giant turds when there's literally every reason (both monetarily and talent-wise) for movies like Transformers to be way better than they are.I'm not against dumb movies, but there's a right way and a wrong way to make them.  Street Fighter gets it right, it actually shows effort and heart.  If you want a truly entertaining dumb action movie, one that knows what kind of fun its having, you've found a great one in Street Fighter.",5,Surprisingly entertaining...,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,4857,"['complaining', 'not', 'faithful', 'source', 'material', 'please', 'stop', 'was', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'made', 'early', 'mid', '90', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'was', 'also', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'had', 'depth', 'character', 'plot', 'All', 'had', 'game', 'write', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'characters', 'looked', 'one', 'two', 'sentences', 'when', 'won', 'fight', 'think', 'pretty', 'reasonable', 'took', 'liberties', 'want', 'faithful', 'SF', 'movie', 'go', 'buy', 'anime', 'movies', 'made', 'one.Okay', 'said', 'like', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'No', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'kid', 'first', 'saw', 'year', ""'m"", '26', 'No', 'not', 'GOOD', 'movie', 'rate', 'films', 'based', 'entertainment', 'value', 'roof', 'Yeah', 'stupid', 'cheese-fest', 'really', 'FUN', 'cheese-fest', 'also', 'fast', 'moving', 'never', 'boring', 'TONS', 'personality', 'kinda', 'ifMegaforcehad', 'been', 'made', 'early', '90', 'actually', 'gotten', 'half', 'one-liners', 'right', 'change.This', 'was', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'final', 'film', 'sad', 'see', 'honestly', 'great', 'actor', 'die', 'fairly', 'young', 'did', 'said', 'who', 'feel', 'role', 'Bison', 'was', 'sad', 'beneath', 'dignity', 'should', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'performance', 'movie', 'clearly', 'having', 'absolute', 'blast', 'Gen.', 'Bison', 'hamming', 'up', 'truly', 'delicious', 'way', 'time', 'screen', 'hilarious', 'treat', 'probably', 'best', 'bad', 'guy', 'overacting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Michael', 'Gough', 'performance', 'inKonga.Julia', 'performance', 'best', 'one', 'acting', 'hammy', 'top', 'thankfully', 'never', 'so', 'much', 'wink-wink', 'level', 'irony', 'Instead', 'everyone', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'what', 'always', 'movies', 'more', 'fun', 'play', 'straight', 'material', 'were', 'serious', 'important', 'ratchet', 'everything', 'up', 'well', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'wife', 'put', 'well', 'when', 'said', 'movie', 'big', 'comic', 'book', 'funny', 'purpose', 'most', 'time', 'fun', 'unintentionally', 'fast', 'entertaining.As', 'far', 'trying', 'incorporate', 'video', 'game', 'elements', 'got', 'real', 'kick', 'how', 'managed', 'get', 'everyone', 'video', 'game', 'costumes', 'point', 'matter', 'how', 'reasons', 'change', 'outfit', 'Ryu', 'Ken', 'finally', 'get', 'karate', 'outfits', 'when', ""'re"", 'mistakenly', 'taken', 'Bison', 'new', 'recruits', 'Chun-Li', 'dresses', 'ridiculous', 'getup', 'game', 'apparently', 'Bison', 'fetish', 'outfit', 'choice', 'LOL', 'Blanka', 'finally', 'monstrous', 'victim', 'genetic', 'super-soldier', 'experiment', 'Dhalsim', 'out', 'normal', 'Indian', 'guy', 'hair', 'video', 'game', 'counterpart', 'getting', 'shirt', 'hair', 'burned', 'off', 'Balrog', 'just', 'up', 'boxing', 'gear', 'end', 'movie', 'explanation', 'offered', 'not', 'even', 'deleted', 'scenes', '.For', 'who', 'might', 'know', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'might', 'seem', 'like', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'given', 'unbridled', 'contempt', 'other', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'adaptation', 'crapfests', 'Transformers', 'movies', 'main', 'difference', 'tone', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'world', 'where', 'everything', 'way', 'giving', 'movie', 'unified', 'feel', 'again', 'big', 'comic', 'book', 'wife', 'put', 'Movies', 'Transformers', 'are', 'just', 'set', 'real', 'world', 'average', 'people', 'character', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'portrayed', 'just', 'normal', 'everyday', 'guy', 'doing', 'dumbest', 'most', 'nonsensical', 'stuff', 'possible.Another', 'difference', 'audience', 'respect', 'factor', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'dumb', 'dumb', 'silly', 'good', 'natured', 'way', 'dumb', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'audience', 'get', 'fun', ""n't"", 'condescend', 'audience', 'treat', 'idiots', 'brainlessness', 'dig', 'too', 'Transformers', 'movies', 'are', 'cynical', 'people', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'honestly', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'better', 'movie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'have', 'respect', 'audience', 'treat', 'cavemen', 'go', 'films', 'laziest', 'way', 'possible', 'thinking', 'wave', 'enough', 'explosions', 'hot', 'chicks', 'front', 'eyes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'sad', 'part', 'Plenty', 'idiots', 'keeping', 'buying', 'tickets', 'not', 'caring', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'being', 'condescending', 'insulting', 'intelligence', 'keep', 'getting', 'giant', 'turds', 'when', 'literally', 'reason', 'monetarily', 'talent-wise', 'movies', 'Transformers', 'be', 'way', 'better', 'are.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'dumb', 'movies', 'right', 'way', 'wrong', 'way', 'make', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'right', 'actually', 'effort', 'heart', 'want', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'dumb', 'action', 'movie', 'one', 'what', 'kind', 'fun', 'having', ""'ve"", 'found', 'great', 'one', 'Street', 'Fighter']",N/A

The acting is deplorable, to be sure.  The only one who's even putting forth any real effort is Raul Julia, who was WAY too wonderful an actor to have been tricked into making this abomination.  Of course, Van-Damme is about as believable and emotive an actor as Carrot Top, so you should know what to expect.  As for the rest of the cast, well, let's just say that the actor's didn't do their own matrial arts; the martial artists did their own acting.  (I know that's an MST3K rip-off, but that's exactly where this movie belongs, really).The plot is pretty much a bunch of random scenes put in a blender.  We go from one unbelievable situation to another, into territories that neither make sense nor entertain.  It amazes me that for all the impressive gadgetry and special effects, this is still no more intelligent or enlightening than the &quot;Guess what?

Street Fighter, however, fails in providing even this level of cheap entertainment. The barely introduced characters slap eachother when they punch and clip the opponent with their toes when they kick. The fighting is so bad that it makes the WWF look authentic. How can you have that in a movie that is solely about fighting?They somehow managed to get everything wrong in a movie based on a video game. Except for one upside-down kick by Guile in the very end, special moves are absent. Many of the characters from the video game don't even do much fighting.  Blanca never electrocutes anyone, Dhalsim never does his yoga stretch attack, and DJ also does nothing. Sagat and Vega are included as M. Bison's henchmen, but they manage to be extaordinarily flaky in everything they do. The good characters, Chun Li, Ken, Ryu, Balrog, and E. Honda are even worse. Every line they speak is hackneyed, trite, and stale. M. Bison himself is excruciatingly annoying because he stops for a fit of maniacal laughter after practically every sentence. In one scene where the good characters come after him, M. Bison flees to safety and laughs his silly evil laugh while his attackers are knocked out with sleeping gas. ""You could have defeated me had you worked together."" He admonishes with a big, arrogant smile, and then laughs some more. Uggh!!!Perhaps the biggest mistake is that the movie is supposed to be in the real world. Guile is a colonel sent by the U.N. to fight M. Bison, a super duper evil crime lord/dictator/mad scientist. The story should have left more room for the supernatural so that special moves could be better incorporated into the plot. M. Bison gains his powers in the very end by using some giant machine to electrify himself. No! That doesn't work! If everything isn't bad enough already, Bison's palace/dungeon/batcave is guarded by stormtrooper wannabees. Naturally, they can't aim, and Van Damme knocks one of them out with a light tap on the helmet. It takes skill to make Van Damme look bad in an action movie! I have never in my life seen a film that is more saturated with ineptitude. Anything in the movie that can be made bad is bad. It is so bad that it's not even a good laugh because it is bad.

57911,A3UA046AA3DXFD,0783227094,Sid the Elf,"[3, 3]","The 90's was a decade dominated by some of the most memorable video games ever created. Next to Madden 97 and NBA Live sat the arcade classic Street Fighter. It was a game kids lined up to play at the arcade, back when those were of more relevance. Another great thing the 90's did was make hilariously awesome B movies predominately in the action and horror genres. Amongst the action genre came a gang of horrible video game movie adaptations that just can't be touched. These movies are pure gold in the B-est way possible. The most noteworthy had to be Mario Brothers (naturally), Mortal Kombat, and our feature flick Street Fighter starring the muscles from Brussels. Any movie starring Van Damme is always a sure thing, especially when it's a video game movie. That is on par with a nice cyborg flick which you know is the tops.Van Damme plays Col. William Guile as he leads his army into a country called Shadaloo. The armies task is to take down the evil country leader General M. Bison. All the video game characters are part of the movie, but don't actually battle it out with each other. So really it's just a really bad action movie that utilizes Street Fighter's video game characters. Hey it works for us like watching Santa squeeze into his football pants. The movie really heats up when one of Van Damme's main soldiers is kidnapped and turned into a hideous freak creature called Blanka...which was the big green guy in the video game. They train Blanka to be an ultimate killing machine by juicing him up and making him watch video clips of all crazy happenings. It's pretty similar to GnR's ""Welcome to the Jungle"" video just way more B. About as B as having fat Axl in the video instead. Despite all the mutating, Col. Guile is able to sooth the savage beast by saying ""c'mon baby, you know you're the girl of my dreams."" Then all the characters reign down blows upon Bison and his evil henchmen, with Van Damme delivery the final death blow.It's funny that a lot of reviews panned Street Fighter in a somewhat brutal fashion. It's a wonder to comprehend what these folks were expecting in a Van Damme movie whose plot is based on a video game. If the movie was actually good then you should be complaining. It was created to be a complete nightmare, unless you're a fellow fan of the B arts. If you love B then Street Fighter is a very enjoyable experience. Yeah of course it's poorly written and acted with even less fines, but that's the beauty of it. Our only complaint is that it actually made the movie theaters and has close to 200 reviews. We typically go straight to video all the way baby. However in certain cases we will delve into the more well known features if the content fits.

57912,A24D44AXINS647,0783227094,Simply Ravishing,"[14, 21]","Where do I even begin with this disaster? Back in the early 90's just about everybody knew what Street Fighter was, and it's no surprise that it was made into a movie. This movie had high expectations, and what a total bomb it turned out to be. Now, if we are talking money-wise here, this movie was a complete success. However, I don't know why because it seems like just about everything that could have gone wrong... did. The biggest flaw of the movie (other than the movie itself) is without a doubt the characters. Nothing against Van Damme, I actually like a lot of his movies, but not for even one second did he convince anybody that he was an American soldier. Charlie and Blanka are not the same person (the movie decided to combine them together, making him ""Carlos Blanka""). After eleven years, I'm still trying to figure out what they were thinking on that one. E. Honda is supposed to be Japanese and not Hawaiian. Balrog joins Honda and Chun Li as part of a news team. Still reading? It gets funnier. Dhalsim was turned into a scientist. Ryu and Ken are hustlers (whatever happened to honor?) Zangief provided comic relief during the movie (who can ever forget ""Quick! Change the channel!"" and ""You got paid?"") And whatever you have heard, Captain Sawada is not Fei Long. The one role they got right was Bison. Julia was perfect for this role. Unfortunately, we all lost a very good actor as he died shortly after this film was made.The fighting scenes are a complete joke. The Honda/Zangief fight was basically them grappling each other and then falling through the floor. Bison's attacks are supposed to be quick, not flying at 2 MPH and having Guile just stand there waiting for Bison to hit him. I really wish I could have included some good points in this movie, but I simply can't. However, for this price, I actually would recommend that you check it out, because if you're like me, you'll have a couple of good laughs during this movie.

Raul Julia, Wes Studi and Van Damme were all casted well. It has good sets, exotic locales and comedy. The film is more of an action comedy than anything. May I add that I liked Guile more here than I did in the game. Not quite up to the funny entertainment or quality par of say Live & Let Die or It's a Mad Mad Mad World but it was better then some claimed, and some people just should not watch these types of films. I feel sorry for film based some of these public judgements of the film so i'm adding another star. Its refreshing to see these older types of adventure/comic book serials without the use of dreaded CGI (I'll take Street Fighter over Spiderman any day). Van Damme is the man but not quite on Chuck Norris' caliber in terms of hip factor, skill and gritty manliness. I got to add that I do like this film more than I did when I first saw it as a lad.

Unfortunately for him, Guile will not obey the wide-eyed psychopath and asks him on international televion, 'hamanee doctors and nurses have you killed?' and 'hamanee children have you orphaned this week Bison?"". It was chronicle! Guile's friend has been taken by the lunatic and Bison changes him into a fighting mutant! Carlos Blanca's life will never be the same. Oh well, enough of that soppy story.

Considering there is no street fighting what so ever in this mammoth production, Van Damme managed to impress me once again with his lordage. He fought Bison with roundhouse kicks, jumpkicks, his trademark 360* kick and the flash kick! YES, genius!

Not only that i wanted to see a movie about my favorite fighting game, not one making fun of it.This entire movie was just another excuse to give Van Damm a reason to hog the camera (Shockingly enough, many say this is his best action film!

(If you think that's bad you should hear him speak English in real time. For the love of god, how many has he lived in America? None of the fight scenes in the movie were anything special or in the least bit memorable, although i will give Chun Li's scene against Bison props. She didn't do too bad a job. I wanted to see more.Even though not much is known about the street fighter storyline, would it have killed the director to stick with what little bit was known? The dialogue between the characters was pretty... Sadly to say the best lines spoken in the movie were the ones when Guile gives an 'supposedly' inspirational speech to his troops. The casting just could have been way better. Bison looked all skinny and shiveled. He wasn't in the least bit convincing as a martial artist. Blanka's makeup was horrible!
