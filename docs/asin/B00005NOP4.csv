669650,AJRZ98VIOES0U,B00005NOP4,Arsenic & Old Lace,"[0, 0]","This is a really bad movie. And by bad, I mean it's so bad it's good, then it becomes bad again. If you liked the preview, you will like the full feature film. Someone mentioned that it looked like it could have been made by a retarded WoW fan... I couldn't agree more. Everything from the hammy-acting, spray-painted set pieces, and shoestring budget that couldn't even cover a proper decapitated head, make Deathstalker a sickening joy to watch.The women get their clothes ripped off for no reason, some even fight topless. Why? I got the feeling that a bad Renaissance troupe ran into a softcore porn set and decided to make a movie. The one thing done right was the wooded back-drop, filmed outside in Argentina. Our hero, the ""Deathstalker,"" glistens with oil throughout the entire movie, as funny as this may sound. Every time he unsheathes his sword, the same epic battle song plays, and it made me think of He-Man. Again, the budget was spread super thin, so the director uses the same gore scene over and over... blood trickling across what looks like a cheap toy sword.Naked slave girls are forced to mud wrestle, a demonic sock puppet is fed human fingers, and there is an arena match with a Pig Man. The movie ends with the Deathstalker walking through a wall of fire to snatch an evil arch-wizard's magic chalice from his grasp. Then he electrocutes it with his sword. That's it. The End.

669654,A14LV2SJSR3102,B00005NOP4,Cartimand,"[2, 3]","Whilst certainly not as entertaining as the brilliant Deathstalker 2, this first outing for our rather dangerous hero is still a cut above the usual Conan clones.From the first scene, where an almost unfeasibly musclebound Rick Hill slaughters a bunch of inbred freaks, skewers an opportunist kidnapper and then starts to ravage his beautiful woman prisoner, we understand that this hero is quite an ambiguous character and we're never quite sure if he's batting for good or for evil.Told by a witch of three unimaginably powerful artefacts and tempted by thoughts of glory, Deathstalker treks to Munkar's castle, where the evil wizard (is there any other kind?) has organised a tournament to find the greatest warrior in the land, to whom has been promised the inheritance of the kingdom. It is, of course, a trick. Munkar merely wants to eliminate any opposition to his nefarious plans and does everything in his power to kill the greatest threat of all - our eponymous hero.The combat sequences are generally well done and surprisingly brutal on occasion. A fair bit of nudity, sometimes tasteful (and featuring some *extremely* attractive women!), sometimes verging on soft-porn in a couple of scenes. Some great black humour adds another dimension to the proceedings - my favourites being Munkar gradually feeding an unfortunate prisoner to a pet ""thing"" in a box, the ""dashing"" Salmaron rescued by Deathstalker, Munkar's servant (expertly played by Marcos Wolinsky - one of the few actors to turn up again in Deathstalker 2) being transformed into a woman and, of course, the first appearance of the, now legendary, pig-headed warrior. His inventive use of an impromptu club is a genuine laugh-out-loud moment!I get the feeling though that Roger Corman wasn't quite sure whether to play it straight or go for greater comedy value. On occasion, Rick Hill seems to take things a tad too seriously (some supposedly profound utterances, such as in my title, being slightly cringeworthy) and, in this respect, the movie kind of falls between two stools and is not entirely successful.Clear and bright picture quality throughout, but only 4:3 aspect ratio and the audio is some early incarnation of Dolby that falls rather short of the DTS we usually expect. No extras of any value on the DVD either.Enough nitpicking though!

I was satisfied!! :)Of course, this movie is not one of the best fantasy action movies ever but I find it very entertaining. Let me describe it:Production: All the settings, costumes, weapons and violence are pretty well designed for a low budget action film. I think that all the characters look kind of cool with those long hairs and barbarian outfits. The special effects are cheap but well done.Action: VERY well made. Pretty much like Highlander or maybe Beastmaster. Of course, not all the fights are cool, some of them are kind of weird but most of them are very intense and exciting. I like when the main character fights a lot of bad guys all by himself, I like when he crawls into caves like a true adventurer, and I also like the final battle. The movie is full of action.Story: IT SUCK'S!!! Men turning into women, women been treated like sexual objects, the hero have sex with women right after saving them???!!! That looks more like a cheap porno film. At least, the cheap basic concept of the hero destroying the evil wizard is good enought for me.Acting: NOTHING professional! but tolerable.Audio: It is monaural and it looks like it was dubbed, but is not THAT bad.Video: It's a little blurred but pretty clear for me.Im an action junkie, so when I watch an action film I mainly focus on the action quality. I love good stories in action films but sometimes I get bored of it when the movie focus more on the story than the action. Example: Conan The Destroyer is NOT better than Conan The Barbarian, but I must admit that Conan The Destroyer is more entertaining.Adios.",3,GREAT action-packed fantasy movie!!

There are no characters that come across as likeable or interesting (in particular, the lead doesn't have ANYTHING appealing about him), and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the F-grade material.  If that's not enough, then how about the lack of a compelling plot (which this movie has nothing of the sort) to make DEATHSTALKER qualify as a major turkey?  I was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to 1) be topless and/or scantily clad; 2) get raped; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) all of the above.  In addition, the background music is hideous; a bizarre mess of electronic noise, cheesy choral bursts, and blaring orchestral cacophony.  Ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with nary a thing to keep one interested, DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited for folks looking for something to laugh at (and believe me, there's plenty of that in here).

Then a powerful witch tells him where to get a powerful sword (why does she want him to have it when he has proven to be a scoundrel?  Unknown).  Armed with the sword, he sets out to get two other powerful objects (an amulet and a chalice, both held by the evil sorcerer).Along the way he forces himself on another woman (who then falls in love with him if you can believe it) and enters a tournament that will kill off the great warriors (as all tournaments to the death do).In the end, Deathstalker manages to defeat the sorcerer in the most anti-climactic scene of all time (he walks up to the sorcerer and takes the chalice as the sorcerer decides to cower and not defend himself).

I was in Grad school in the early 80's, and a group of friends (those of us who were not into getting drunk) would go to the movies Friday afternoon.  We would pick out the schlockiest looking movie.  A lot of bad barbarian movies came out at the time, so we never had a shortage of dumb movies to see.  Since there were usually very few people in the audience, we would compete to come up with the funniest comment during the movie.  Yes, we did our own version of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" long before the show made it popular. And we had a hell of a lot of fun.Deathstalker is a perfect example of the early Eighties bad barbarian genre.  Most featured variations on the same core plot of a lone warrior who gathers friends while he reluctantly goes on a quest to defeat somebody evil.  One friend is the comic relief, while at least one friend dies.  Low budget with location shooting in the woods, cheap sets and cheaper costumes.  Bad acting with even worse writing.  Cheesy make-up and special effects.  The better ones had gratuitous blood and boobs.  Usually there was a ""warrior woman"" who wears next to nothing going into battle.  The guys also spend a lot of time shirtless, too.The only ""name"" in the film is former Playboy Playmate Barbi Benton, who goes shows her breasts about a fourth of the time she is on screen.  The other young women are often topless, too.  There is lots of attempted rape in this film, a few beheadings and some limbs ripped off, as you would expect if it is rated ""R.""  None of them look very real (except some of the breasts).This film is definitely a step down in quality from movies like ""Conan the Barbarian"" and ""Beastmaster.""

You want historical accuracy go watch the history channel! This is an 80s B Movie and it's a good one. That's why it commands a high price. You can't even start to compare this to something like Lord of the Rings( wich I'm sure most of the Teenie Boppers out there are going to do) because this was a whole different time.

669663,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005NOP4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Deathstalker (James Sbardellati, 1983)There are some sword and sorcery movies that are very good. Well, I'm sure they exist, anyway, though I can't think of any off the top of my head. But for the most part, they are very, very bad. After the Schwarzenegger-led Conan the Barbarian got unaccountably popular after its 1982 release (I remember liking Mad Magazine's parody, Conehead the Barbiturate, a whole lot better), every fly-by-night studio and its cousin decided to do a sword-and-sorcery epic. Deathstalker may not be the worst of the lot, but it is the worst that I've seen. Not a huge surprise that, though he was originally uncredited, Roger Corman had a hand in this (it and its sequel were later released as part of the Roger Corman Sword and Sorcery collection, along with the other timeless classics Barbarian Queen and The Warrior and the Sorceress. I've never seen that last one. I'm guessing I can safely skip it.)Plot: Deathstalker (Class of 1999 II's Rick Hill) is one of those brawny, always-shirtless warriors with a big sword and a taste for swinging it. He and his small band are journeying around helping old ladies across the street and getting cats out of trees when they run into a couple of other adventurers on the road&#8212;the similarly-topless Kaira (the late Lana Clarkson, best known these days as the woman Phil Spector was found guilty of murdering), who tells him about a tournament being held by local overlord Munkar (Firefox's Bernard Erhard) to determine his heir, and Oghris (Friday the 13th Part III's Richard Brooker), who's also on his way to the same tournament. Deathstalker throws in with them, and they all head on to Munkar's castle. But Deathstalker has an ulterior motive; a wise woman has told him that the sword he wields is very special, and that if it is reunited with the chalice and amulet that go with it&#8212;both of which Munkar holds, and which are the key to his power&#8212;that Deathstalker will become the world's most powerful warrior. But Munkar, of course, knows Deathstalker is coming, and he wants the sword just as much as Deathstalker wants the other pieces...It would normally be your basic stupid swords-and-sorcery movie, albeit with a lot more boobs on offer than most movies of its stripe, had anyone who touched Howard Cohen (Saturday the 14th)'s script gotten in a few edits. It's obvious from frame one that Deathstalker is the Good Guy(TM) and Munkar the Bad Guy(TM). And Munkar's character is pretty stereotypically Bad Guy, but Deathstalker's Good Guy is, well, not all that hot. For example, the first night they're at Munkar's place, Munkar brings in his newest slave girl, Codille (Hee Haw hottie Barbi Benton), who also happens to be a kidnapped princess. There's a battle for who will spend the night with her, which of course Deathstalker wins. You expect that he&#8212;who is, after all, travelling with Bodacious Naked Lana Clarkson and is supposed to be going around helping old ladies across the street and getting cats out of trees&#8212;is going to tell Munkar &#8220;yeah, I'll take her back to my room and roger her most severely&#8221;, and then come up with some sort of plan to get her out of the castle and back to her throne. But, erm, no, after a bunch of skullduggery, Munkar hexes up his right-hand man to look like Codille and sends him off to Deathstalker's chamber...where Deathstalker does exactly what he said he was going to do. Until, at least, he realizes something's afoot (or adick, as the case may be), and maybe the boobs he's fondling are not royal after all. So it's not Deathstalker's good nature that stops this rape (and let's be honest, that's exactly what it is) from happening, but the fact that the funky cold medina got into the wrong drink. That's a hero for ya!End result: this is stupid and cheesy with a hefty side of nauseating. Avoid at all costs.

You can blame Conan the Barbarian for making the genre famous and for inspiring every hack writer and moviemaker in Hollywood to jump on board. Deathstalker is just such a movie. With it's extremely low budget look and even lower standards of writing I find it hard to validate any reason why the movie was even created other than to ride in the coattails of Conan and other such movies.Corman Corman Corman... For such a well-known director you sure do make some really bad movies sometimes. Deathstalker is just such a movie. I can get over the low budget aspect. I can get over only having three songs played throughout the entire movie. What I CAN'T get over is the poor excuse for a plot. Deathstalker has one of the worst plot structures I have ever seen in a movie. Add to that the low budget and weak soundtrack and you really don't have anything to work with as far as making a good movie.Deathstalker seems to be nothing but a grandstanding of T and A. Lots of scantily clad women in thongs running around a bunch of dirty guys chasing after them. That is the extent of the many scenes in the movie. The story feels like it has no direction to it. Sure there is a plot that was mentioned by an old lady who is in the movie twice, but I can't help but ask why the heck this Deathstalker guy even cares. He comes off as a self-centered brute as it is. Why he decided to save the world is beyond me.The sets and special effects are laughable. I actually saw stones painted on a wooden platform to make it look like an old castle wall. Makeup and masks are definitely a Corman cost cut. There is some gory violence in the movie, but much of it is cheaply done. The sound is also cheap. Not only do you get redundant music like I mentioned but also those little annoying dialog dubs such as the lamest screams of the dying I have heard in a long time. This movie doesn't have much going for it at all.Deathstalker has nothing going for it other than camp value, and that it has plenty. Maybe you can play drinking games on how many times the same song is played. I dunno. I suppose if you are really into swords and sorcery it wouldn't hurt to rent it, but there are so many better movies out. Ultimately Deathstalker is not worth your time.
