It's less about being ""goth"" than it is about a girl who is named Goth (Phoebe Dollar from Hell's Highway). Goth is a woman without limits or conscience. I was intrigued by her ability to do anything she pleased without fear or concern. This is a woman who could just as easily kill you as talk to you! I like that in a woman! The couple that Goth kidnaps is in for a hellish ride! So, if you enjoy the bleak world of the unhinged, GOTH should flip your coffin lid!

753430,A2TLCUIM32YZJP,B00009AV8Q,James E. Martin II,"[68, 74]","This is without a doubt the worst movie ever made.Ya the worst movie ever made.Let me make sure you understand what I mean when I say that it is THE WORST MOVIE EVER PUT TO FILM IN THE HISTORY OF MOVIE MAKING. This makes Hunting Humans look like the Exorcist.I would rather give myself an at home vasectomy with my neighbors rabid cat than watch this movie again.But...  ...If you have to watch, if your curiosity cannot be contained, be sure to check out all of the killer special features (LOL). And be sure to watch the riveting trailer to get ya in the mood. But if you wish, I can give ya a synopsis of the film and spare you the pain that no one living should ever have to know. (Without the aid of some special brownies of course :) )The story follows the riveting journey of these two characters. One who lookes like Shannen Doherty, and the other that lookes like a wannabe gothic Lance Bass. They are a couple, and they are also ""gothic"". They go to a ""gothic"" club. Just to show you how gothic this movie is so far. The boyfriend's name is Boone, how gothic is that.While at this ""gothic"" club, they meet this gothic chick (I am not bull sh*ting you) named ""Goth"". You heard it boys and girls a goth girl actually named ""Goth"". The worst wannabe in the history of the gothic culture has never stooped this low. WTF!Goth tells them the three rules.1 Embrace the darkness2 Kill your fear3 Live for deathTo make a long story short, Goth kills a few people while strung out on this flour like substance called White light. Ohhh so scary. The special effects are more like the special olympics, and the acting is even worse.  The retarded kid who played Corkie did a better job.  Kermit the frog is more gothic than anything in this POS movie. This movie was written by a man who knows nothing about the gothic culture from his own admission. Not a single f*@king thing.

753431,A9HL27V9DL3PC,B00009AV8Q,"J. Rosario ""serial_clone""","[4, 4]","I rented this movie expecting to see a portrayal of ""Goth culture"" in its stereotypical form (e.g. vampires, thrill killings, ""embracing the darkness""), and well. . . I was right. However, me being familiar with the Goth scene (which is just music despite the claims of an angst ridden teenager), I was able to find some priceless humor in the movie. The humor doesn't apply to just the Goth scene, but any type of music scene where a large portion of its members try and make themselves out to be elitists and live their lives according to the image of whatever music it is that they're into. Goth ( the movie) can be easily described as The Doom Generation meets Training Day; except instead of the co stars (Chrissy and Boone [what the hell kind of name is that?]) struggling to make the narcotics squad, they're on a quest to be able to truly label themselves Goth, and prove to the main character - who by coincidence is named Goth - that they're not poseurs; which leads to Goth threatening the couple to take part in bad things (things that Goths allegedly do when they're together) by taunting them with the dreaded question: ""What's the matter? I thought you guys were Goth?"" Of course there are a few twists in this movie, but I can't figure out how to talk about them without giving everything away. It wasn't the best story in the world, but the movie did keep me entertained which is what it's supposed to do, and it had some really good industrial songs by some lesser known bands which I thought was cool. I'll just conclude my review with a few questions I have (and I'm sure you'll have) after seeing this movie: how could this be a movie about Goths if half of the soundtrack is Electronic-Industrial? How did Boone's glass refill itself with Absinthe after he clearly poured it out in the alley? And who in God's name is driving the van?",3,Oh my goth!

753433,A2QO1SK1K1E04Z,B00009AV8Q,"Trash Winters ""Disease of the Age""","[0, 0]","I'm fairly divided on most movies. They fall into three categories for me: awesome, boring, and painful to watch.Goth is one of those films that carefully toes the line between awesome and painful to watch, in much the same way as a Coen Brothers film.Unlike any of the Coen Brothers' work, however, Goth is a low-budget, homemade festival of bizarre stupidity tailor-made to be full of intentional cheese.The plot concerns a late teen or early twentysomething Gothic couple who live together in an apartment in LA. The beginning of the film makes a huge point of how goth they are, and the couple constantly talking about how goth they are. Then they go to a goth club, just to show how goth they are. Even more Gothic by far? They meet a girl named Goth.Goth gets the couple wigged out on drugs and leads them on a hedonistic spree of sex and murder. I will say that each and every one of the scenes of sex and violence is impossibly funny coupled with Goth's rants about worshipping death and embracing the darkness.Just from that summary you've probably figured out by now that this movie sounds absolutely horrible: it is.However, if you enjoy fake blood and guts, hammy b-list actors pretending to act crazy and/or scared in something vaguely resembling a high school drama performance, and silly lines, you may very well find Goth's infuriating lack of any cinematic quality to be its main charm.",3,So dumb it's good,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,1403,"[""'m"", 'fairly', 'divided', 'most', 'movies', 'fall', 'three', 'categories', 'awesome', 'boring', 'painful', 'one', 'films', 'carefully', 'line', 'awesome', 'painful', 'watch', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'film.Unlike', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'work', 'however', 'Goth', 'low-budget', 'homemade', 'festival', 'bizarre', 'stupidity', 'tailor-made', 'be', 'full', 'intentional', 'cheese.The', 'plot', 'concerns', 'late', 'teen', 'early', 'twentysomething', 'Gothic', 'couple', 'who', 'live', 'together', 'apartment', 'LA', 'beginning', 'film', 'huge', 'point', 'how', 'goth', 'are', 'couple', 'constantly', 'talking', 'how', 'goth', 'are', 'Then', 'go', 'goth', 'club', 'just', 'show', 'how', 'goth', 'are', 'Even', 'more', 'Gothic', 'far', 'meet', 'girl', 'named', 'Goth.Goth', 'couple', 'wigged', 'out', 'drugs', 'hedonistic', 'spree', 'sex', 'murder', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'scenes', 'sex', 'violence', 'impossibly', 'funny', 'coupled', 'Goth', 'rants', 'worshipping', 'death', 'embracing', 'darkness.Just', 'summary', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'figured', 'out', 'now', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'is.However', 'enjoy', 'fake', 'blood', 'guts', 'hammy', 'b-list', 'actors', 'pretending', 'act', 'crazy', 'and/or', 'scared', 'something', 'vaguely', 'resembling', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'performance', 'silly', 'lines', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'find', 'Goth', 'infuriating', 'lack', 'cinematic', 'quality', 'be', 'main', 'charm']",Goth
