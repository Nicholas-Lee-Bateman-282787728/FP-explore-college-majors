Rich plays matchmaker, despite Will's protests, and arranges for him to meet the hunky Josh, also a former Navy man. They get off on the wrong foot, until a devastating event forces them together, and somewhat puts in perspective their need for each other.The plot is a bit formulaic and predictable, and the secondary characters - while somewhat realistic - are mostly over-the-top stereotypes. I give the screenwriter props for including different generations of gay men as friends, and the attempt at illustrating the minefields one might encounter in trying to cultivate a relationship. Josh is played by Ian Roberts, a former Australian rugby star who created quite a stir when he came out as gay in the late 1990's. Overall, it is a good effort with capable actors, but I think it fails on several levels, in my opinion. No nudity, likely a light R for sexual references.

The first attempt was an obvious blind date setup where it seems that the only things the 2 men have in common is that they are wearing the same color shirts and they are both &#8220;ex-Navy,&#8221; Will from the U.S. and Josh from Australia but from different generations. Whereas Josh&#8217;s service was cut short due to a dishonorable discharge for being gay, Will had 20+ years (he must have joined at age 10 as he barely looks 30) of a &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell-type&#8221; career. Josh would have none of that and quickly revealed the chip on his shoulder for being thrown out of the Australian Navy. He made it clear that he felt Will was &#8220;in the closet&#8221; and Will made it clear that &#8220;rainbow stickers and parades&#8221; are not important to him. Josh asks for the check and so begins several attempts during several holidays to hook these 2 up despite the fact that Will sees no way to reconcile a rough first date.In a way, I can understand Will&#8217;s point of view. After several more failed attempts of getting these 2 together, I kept asking myself why on earth does Josh simply apologize for walking out on the first date? Instead, he shows up with different guys he is dating at each successive holiday party. He says he is trying to make Will jealous but were I in Will&#8217;s shoes, I too would think Josh has &#8220;moved on&#8221; and attempt to do the same. Nevertheless, with each party, Josh is obviously obsessed with Will who can&#8217;t keep his eyes off of Josh and wonders what &#8220;might be&#8221; but he is too fearful of further rejection to pursue it. So, now it is Will who has the chip on his shoulder.The movie is chock full of stereotypes from the get go with the flamboyant Rich to gossiping gays, most of whom also seem determined to thrust Will and Josh together and all who know the exact way to do it despite the fact that their lives are a lot less than perfect. There are the usual stereotypical gay sex hounds who have nothing else on their minds other than attempting to end their lonliness by &#8220;conquering&#8221; any and all who look like they need rescue. To the movie&#8217;s credit, one such scene helped to show us the integrity of one of the main characters.There is also the usual &#8220;C&#8212;&#8212;Blocker&#8221; who is so jealous of a single friend having a date that they will say and do anything and everything to stand between that friend and their date. Some people just feel so damn sorry for themselves (whether they are in a relationship or not) because they are not having &#8220;fun&#8221; that they will do anything to stop you from having fun. If a friend tries to block your happiness they are no friend.This movie is quite accurate in portraying the dysfunctions of gays and straights alike. The most disturbing is the drinking of an entire bottle of tequila on a dare of who can &#8220;hold their liquor.&#8221; To its credit however, it provided another opportunity to show one character&#8217;s integrity and true romantic intentions.The one totally supportive, and non-intrusive character of Will is Mike (played by Will Bethencourt who also played in &#8220;Sober Since,&#8221; &#8220;Bear City&#8221; and &#8220;August&#8221;). He is HAWT in everything he plays!Will our 2 &#8220;heroes&#8221; ever get together? In the final analysis I feel this movie is worth it to stick around and find out despite its overall contrived scenes and dysfunctional, stereotypical behaviors. Yes, the &#8220;chemistry&#8221; could have been better. Yes, the 1 major love scene was kind of lame. However, I have seen a lot worse in this genre so I made it all the way to the end. Although it is not a 5 star film, it certainly is not a 1 star film. I rate it 3 1/2 stars.What does all of this have to do with &#27985;&#27700;&#25720;&#40060; Good opportunity will flash before you faster than lightning?Although this movie was full of second chances, seldom, if ever, does a life circumstance give you a second chance. If you are not mentally, physically and financially ready at all times you will miss the opportunities that life offers for happiness. You must risk and trust in yourself to reach out and grab it while it is in front of you. If you lose, at least you tried. If you do not try, it becomes a regret. Do not spend any time grieving what you have lost or what might have been. Move on and be ready next time.",3,Extremely Contrived Tear-Jerker but I recommend it,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,4918,"['27985', '27700', '25720', '40060', 'Good', 'opportunity', 'will', 'flash',

Today, I have a new theory to explain this weird phenomenon.  I live in a major metropolitan area where the gay men tend to be educated and well read.  They also have plenty of opportunities for experiencing media exploring a vast range of GBLT images.  Such people have zero patience for puerile crap like Saltwater.Apparently, such is not the case out there in The Flyover where all the smart and motivated queers have long since fled hometown provincialism and prejudice for the infinite possibilities of life in the big city.  It's the under-achieving and under-educated gay guys who find themselves hopelessly mired in the small cities and towns of the American heartland where attitudes are not nearly so liberal and open as in the major metro areas, and it's these sadsacks who are the target market for gay pulp movies--very much in the same way Harlequin Romances are blatantly marketed to women who quite possibly chose to have a baby with their sweetheart instead of completing high school or otherwise ended up indentured for life in a minimum wage job.  Only people with limited educations and/or opportunities could possibly believe such lowest-common-denominator escape entertainments like gay pulp flicks or Harlequin Romances are actually good.Yes, I am aware how elitist my theory sounds.  Nonetheless, I find it morally reprehensible that cynical distributors should so shamelessly exploit an unsophisticated audience starving for images of themselves to which they might relate.  Regrettably, the digital revolution in filmmaking has yielded far more dismal, bedroom-edited vanity projects than it has liberated gifted filmmakers.""Saltwater"" is essentially a silly pastiche of stereotypes, clich&eacute;s and fantasies pretending it's a movie.  Saltwater sux, as does the system--including Amazon--that distributes a super-abundance of dumbed-down flicks and similar pulp product as serious cinema worthy of a thinking person's consideration.Myself, I feel ripped off for being lured into wasting my time with such shameless mediocrity, but I hope I've at long last learned a critically important lesson:  While I am constantly on the prowl for undiscovered fresh or original indy movies flying beneath the mainstream radar, there are plenty of kinds of movies I've learned how to categorically avoid because they too rarely scratch my itch: Bollywood musicals are never high on my list.  Ditto teen slasher flicks and anything with zombies or vampires.  I just don't go there nor am I even remotely the target market for those varieties of product.  Now I know that anything labeled ""gay"" is more likely than not schlocky buzzkill, and I need never again bum myself out when my hopes for something clever and original fall miserably short.  Besides, real movies with GBLT themes and/or content already steer clear of the gaysploitation ghetto anyway.  If there's anything good, no doubt word will reach my ears.  Meanwhile, definitely no more flyers on anything labeled gay from neither Amazon nor Netflix.",1,Pitiful,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,3204,"[""'T"", 'great', 'puzzlement', 'why', 'majority', 'gay', 'genre', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'lame', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'yet', 'continue', 'garner', 'masses', 'four', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'Today', 'have', 'new', 'theory', 'explain', 'weird', 'phenomenon', 'live', 'major', 'metropolitan', 'area', 'where', 'gay', 'men', 'tend', 'be', 'educated', 'well', 'read', 'also', 'have', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'experiencing', 'media', 'exploring', 'vast', 'range', 'GBLT', 'images', 'Such', 'people', 'have', 'zero', 'patience', 'puerile', 'crap', 'Saltwater.Apparently', 'such', 'not', 'case', 'there', 'Flyover', 'where', 'smart', 'motivated', 'queers', 'have', 'long', 'fled', 'hometown', 'provincialism', 'prejudice', 'infinite', 'possibilities', 'life', 'big', 'city', 'under-achieving', 'under-educated', 'gay', 'guys', 'who', 'find', 'hopelessly', 'mired', 'small', 'cities', 'towns', 'American', 'heartland', 'where', 'attitudes', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'liberal', 'open', 'major', 'metro', 'areas', 'sadsacks', 'who', 'are', 'target', 'market', 'gay', 'pulp', 'movies', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Harlequin', 'Romances', 'are', 'blatantly', 'marketed', 'women', 'who', 'quite', 'possibly', 'chose', 'have', 'baby', 'sweetheart', 'instead', 'completing', 'high', 'school', 'otherwise', 'ended', 'up', 'indentured', 'life', 'minimum', 'wage', 'job', 'Only', 'people', 'limited', 'educations', 'and/or', 'opportunities', 'could', 'possibly', 'believe', 'such', 'lowest-common-denominator', 'escape', 'entertainments', 'gay', 'pulp', 'flicks', 'Harlequin', 'Romances', 'are', 'actually', 'good.Yes', 'am', 'aware', 'how', 'elitist', 'theory', 'sounds', 'Nonetheless', 'find', 'morally', 'reprehensible', 'cynical', 'distributors', 'should', 'so', 'shamelessly', 'exploit', 'unsophisticated', 'audience', 'starving', 'images', 'might', 'relate', 'Regrettably', 'digital', 'revolution', 'filmmaking', 'yielded', 'far', 'more', 'dismal', 'bedroom-edited', 'vanity', 'projects', 'liberated', 'gifted', 'filmmakers', 'Saltwater', 'essentially', 'silly', 'pastiche', 'stereotypes', 'clich', 'eacute', 'fantasies', 'pretending', 'movie', 'Saltwater', 'sux', 'system', 'including', 'Amazon', 'super-abundance', 'dumbed-down', 'flicks', 'similar', 'pulp', 'product', 'serious', 'cinema', 'worthy', 'thinking', 'person', 'consideration.Myself', 'feel', 'ripped', 'off', 'being', 'lured', 'wasting', 'time', 'such', 'shameless', 'mediocrity', 'hope', ""'ve"", 'long', 'last', 'learned', 'critically', 'important', 'lesson', 'am', 'constantly', 'prowl', 'undiscovered', 'fresh', 'original', 'indy', 'movies', 'flying', 'mainstream', 'radar', 'are', 'plenty', 'kinds', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'how', 'categorically', 'avoid', 'too', 'rarely', 'scratch', 'itch', 'Bollywood', 'musicals', 'are', 'never', 'high', 'list', 'Ditto', 'teen', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'anything', 'zombies', 'vampires', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'am', 'even', 'remotely', 'target', 'market', 'varieties', 'product', 'Now', 'know', 'anything', 'labeled', 'gay', 'more', 'likely', 'not', 'schlocky', 'buzzkill', 'need', 'never', 'again', 'bum', 'out', 'when', 'hopes', 'something', 'clever', 'original', 'fall', 'miserably', 'short', 'Besides', 'real', 'movies', 'GBLT', 'themes', 'and/or', 'content', 'already', 'steer', 'clear', 'gaysploitation', 'ghetto', 'anyway', 'anything', 'good', 'doubt', 'word', 'will', 'reach', 'ears', 'Meanwhile', 'definitely', 'more', 'flyers', 'anything', 'labeled', 'gay', 'Amazon', 'Netflix']",N/A
