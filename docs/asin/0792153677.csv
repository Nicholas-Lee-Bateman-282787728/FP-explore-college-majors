In the first one, everything in the Blue's Clues environment is labled. However, they mainly do not look at the lable but rather just the first letter of an object. Futher, they get into reading comprehension when most kids are still trying understand what they hear when someone reads a story to them. SO I find the first segment a little bit of a loss educationally.The second segment, however, deals with numbers and counting. Everything is counted out- number of ice cubes, blue dollars, steps to the door and so on. Great repetition.I have to admit that Blue's Clues is not my favorite tv show. I find it irritating and do not appreciate the fact that Steve acts so goofy at times. So that may contribute to the lower four rating. However, it's mainly been rated a four due to the first segment being an educational loss in my mind.I like the fact that it has to sections. This is an easy way to limit the tv/videos that my son watches. I only allow him a limited amount of tv/videos a day and this gives it an easy break point for stopping the video and playing with toys.Enjoy.",4,My 3 year old loves this video.,1026777600,"07 16, 2002",2002,1196,"['three', 'year', 'old', 'Blue', 'Clues.I', 'particularly', 'find', 'second', 'segment', 'tape', 'more', 'educational', 'first', 'one', 'everything', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'environment', 'labled', 'However', 'mainly', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'lable', 'rather', 'just', 'first', 'letter', 'object', 'Futher', 'get', 'reading', 'comprehension', 'when', 'most', 'kids', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'hear', 'when', 'someone', 'story', 'find', 'first', 'segment', 'little', 'bit', 'loss', 'educationally.The', 'second', 'segment', 'however', 'deals', 'numbers', 'counting', 'Everything', 'counted', 'out-', 'number', 'ice', 'cubes', 'blue', 'dollars', 'steps', 'door', 'so', 'Great', 'repetition.I', 'have', 'admit', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'not', 'favorite', 'tv', 'show', 'find', 'irritating', 'do', 'not', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'Steve', 'so', 'goofy', 'times', 'may', 'contribute', 'lower', 'four', 'rating', 'However', 'mainly', 'been', 'rated', 'four', 'due', 'first', 'segment', 'being', 'educational', 'loss', 'mind.I', 'fact', 'sections', 'easy', 'way', 'limit', 'tv/videos', 'son', 'watches', 'only', 'allow', 'limited', 'amount', 'tv/videos', 'day', 'easy', 'break', 'point', 'stopping', 'video', 'playing', 'toys.Enjoy']","Blue's Clues - ABC's and 1,2,3's VHS"

Blue, Sidetable drawer, mailbox(he loves the mailtime song),and all the other characters they meet in each episode entice him into keeping his eyes on the screen.  I don't think he is a big lover of Steve. Steve comes off as very goofy. He is trying to have fun and be a friend to children, but to me it comes off way too goofy, and I think even my son sees this too.""Blue's Clues"" itself has been a huge commerical success and the marketing for it amazes me. They have every single toy you can think of. My baby is already being sucked in by the media frenzy!!! eeek!!! Anyway, this is a fun video, and he will have it for a long time as in another year he will really be listening and learning. He does learn now, he picks up words here and there. The overall lessons taught though are far beyond what he can grasp.Still recommended!!! Toddlers will love the cartoon characters and music..and they will be watching for a few years...Eileen Famiglietti",3,My son loves anything to do w/ Blue,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,1379,"['son', '1', '1/2', 'yr', 'old', 'already', 'big', 'fan', 'Blues', 'Clues', 'ABC', '123', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'videos', 'have', 'watch', 'even', 'too', 'young', 'really', 'learn', 'education', 'standpoint', 'still', 'Blue', 'friends.The', 'music', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'seem', 'keep', 'attention', 'now', 'been', 'watching', 'awhile', 'are', 'old', 'friends', 'Blue', 'Sidetable', 'drawer', 'mailbox', 'mailtime', 'song', 'other', 'characters', 'meet', 'episode', 'entice', 'keeping', 'eyes', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'big', 'lover', 'Steve', 'Steve', 'off', 'very', 'goofy', 'trying', 'have', 'fun', 'be', 'friend', 'children', 'off', 'way', 'too', 'goofy', 'think', 'even', 'son', 'too', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'been', 'huge', 'commerical', 'success', 'marketing', 'have', 'single', 'toy', 'can', 'think', 'baby', 'already', 'being', 'sucked', 'media', 'frenzy', 'eeek', 'Anyway', 'fun', 'video', 'will', 'have', 'long', 'time', 'year', 'will', 'really', 'be', 'listening', 'learning', 'learn', 'now', 'up', 'words', 'here', 'there', 'overall', 'lessons', 'taught', 'though', 'are', 'far', 'what', 'can', 'grasp.Still', 'recommended', 'Toddlers', 'will', 'love', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'music..and', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'few', 'years', 'Eileen', 'Famiglietti']","Blue's Clues - ABC's and 1,2,3's VHS"

We thought videos could not be worn out, especially after we only bought this copy 9 months earlier. This gets watched by our 2 year twice daily EVERY day. From a parents point of view it's a great learning tool for kids and fun with the &quot;absorbing&quot; quality that gets kids everytime. How sad it is, that we find ourselves sitting down too and watching it almost daily. This edition is the favorite, as we have 2 others. It covers ABC and 123's and although we have read other reviews with parents saying their 3 year old and under not suitable, we must admit that our 2 year old loves it.
