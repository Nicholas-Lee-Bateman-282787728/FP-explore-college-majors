Check it out: [...]My approach to this show was within the context of the inventions and DaVinci's genius and artistic talent I saw first-hand in France.  Independent of historical inaccuracy, the story is entertaining and the overall visual effect is stunning in every scene.  The costumes, sets, lighting and props were all excellent, and the graphics were enjoyable.For the record, I'm put off by Hollywood ramming homosexuality into every program; it really is getting old.  At least they didn't have any Brokeback Mountain scenes, thankfully.  It is a deliberate effort to degrade modern culture, and does nothing for gay rights advocates, in my opinion.That aside, this series did manage to display a wide range of dramatic themes, romance, action, intrigue, politics, and a bit of the contrast between liberty and tyranny, in its own way.  Overall consider this an entertaining adult program on many levels, and you should not be disappointed.

Unfortunately I won't be able to see anymore until the Blu-ray is released.  Even so, I was able to summon enough of an opinion from several viewings of the first episode to form a sufficient review, which I shall surely update once I've watched the entire season.  For the moment I can write that, initially at least, Da Vinci's Demons is utterly, shockingly, delightfully absorbing.  As a historical fantasy set in Renaissance Italy it is roughly contemporaneous with Showtime's The Borgias, which would seem to make one robust competition for the other.  Rather to my surprise, the debut series puts The Borgias to shame.  This has less to do with differences in budget--while I cannot know which show has the greater and which the lesser, I suspect The Borgias is slightly ahead of Da Vinci's Demons--and more to do with the quality of the scripts.  For all its sumptuous production value The Borgias suffers from writing which, while competent, is decidedly unremarkable, consisting of very spare dialogue which too often the actors, by attempting to make the most of it, stretch painfully thin.  Not so with Da Vinci's Demons.  Here is abundance, exuberance, and wit.  Repartee is fast-paced and charming.  Gravitas is measured without sounding inflated.  The appearance of the dire phrase, ""Believe in yourself,"" was enough to disrupt the harmony.  But, that being the only false note, the writing was, to my ear, uniformly excellent.  And there was nothing in the production which failed to captivate.These are my impressions, gathered as they are from a mere taste.

1643088,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00C7AO2J6,Grady Harp,"[65, 76]","And so another extended series based on historical data begins and oddly enough the other series set in the same time frame, THE BORGIAS, is similar to the decadent feeling established by the first episode of DA VINCI'S DEMONS. The writers and directors of this series of eight episodes vary from week to week and so we may have a different opinion with each passing episode. Is the series worth watching? It seems so, if the antics that occur in episode 1 are indicative of the direction.After a rather hilarious opening with the fully nude Hugh Bonneville and his male consort preparing to face a new day worried about bowels and other matters - a brief setting as Bonnevile is instantly murdered - we move into Renaissance Florence where the 25 year old artist/engineer/wizard genius Leonardo Da Vinci (Tom Riley) is working on yet another amazing use of flight with his friends Nico (Eros Vlahos) and Zoroaster (Gregg Chillin) and the amiable Verrocchio (Alan Corduner). The young Da Vinci is a lover (with the Medici mistress Lucrezia played by Laura Haddock) because of his talents at portraiture and cunning, an idealist who believes anything is possible if you just think of it. He mixes with the court of the Medicis (Elliot Cowan is Lorenzo) and struggles with his sense of dark demons brought into focus by his visit with Al-Rahim (Alexander Siddig), and is always cognizant of the fact that he is tortured by `a gift of superhuman genius, a heretic intent on exposing the lies of religion, an insurgent seeking to subvert an elitist society, a bastard son who yearns for legitimacy with his father. He finds himself in the midst of a storm that has been brewing for centuries - a conflict between truth and lies, religion and reason, past and future. His aspirations are used against him by the opposing forces of the time-luring him into a game of seduction where those who despise his intellect need him most. Leonardo must take up the fight against foes who use history to suppress the truth. A hero armed only with genius, Da Vinci stands alone against the darkness within, and the darkness without. Facing an uncertain future, his quest for knowledge nearly becomes his undoing as he explores the fringes of his own sanity. Da Vinci throws himself into his genius and emerges as an unstoppable force that lifts an entire era out of darkness and propels it into light. His story becomes a mirror into our own world, calling us all to join his fight to Free the Future.' This latter portion is provided by the PR for the series.The scenery is magnificent, the drawings of Da Vinci come wonderfully to life through this episode, and the innumerable subplots are at times hinted and at other times well started.

1643099,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00C7AO2J6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 8]","The Starz network original production ""Da Vinci's Demons"" is a show that is sure to engender a mixed reaction.  As a slick and polished entertainment, the program is a fun mix of historical personages and rather fanciful plotlines.  It is NOT meant to be taken as a literal representation of history or even as a realistic portrait of Leonardo Da Vinci.  Instead, it is an over-the-top spectacle set as an adult adventure series.  Da Vinci is seen as a savant that can lose touch with the social niceties when obsessed with a current invention or idea.  He is selfish, single-minded, and many times quite comical.  In an amusing bit of visual flourish, these mental images are often shot in an animated style so that you may get into the madness and genius of Da Vinci from a more visceral viewpoint.  Created by David S. Goyer, the screenwriter of the Dark Knight trilogy, ""Da Vinci's Demons"" shares similar themes as the Batman saga (our hero is even imprisoned with bats in one sequence and uses them to help him escape) but with considerably more humor and outlandishness.  I repeat, if you come to ""Da Vinci's Demons"" expecting to fact check its history and realism--you will be sorely disappointed.  But despite its silliness (and it is quite silly at times), I enjoyed this tale of sex, genius, violence, and mysticism designed as an energetic and entertainingly dark romp for adult audiences.Set in Renaissance era Florence, Da Vinci (the charismatic Tom Riley) is introduced as somewhat of a rogue and ne'er-do-well.  Brash, confrontational, and wildly enthusiastic, this is Da Vinci's world and the eccentric genius expects everyone to cater to his needs.  And, for the most part, they do!  Oftentimes, this is represented in comical fashion and can be quite hilarious.  But under the surface, Da Vinci is tortured by visions of an unknown future.  He sees grisly spectacles and is chasing down a truth that comes to him through seers, nightmares, and other manner of psychic connection.  Also a renowned artist, he becomes intrigued by a local beauty (Laura Haddock) which brings him to the attention of the Medici clan who are the current rulers of Florence.  The lass is Lorenzo Medici's (Elliot Cowan) mistress, but she also has ties to the forces of Rome.  The land is in a time of political upheaval, you see.  Florence is thriving as a rather decadent ideal of freedom and wealth, and the reigning political forces of Rome want to bring it in line.  Evil and treachery is epitomized by the villainous Riario (Blake Ritson, seething through every scene) as Rome's unscrupulous henchman.  And as war is about to ignite, Da Vinci's unusual brand of genius is often what stands in the way of utter disaster.The plot of ""Da Vinci's Demons"" is twisty, violent, and dark.  The show is loaded with grisly scenes and copious amounts of nudity (Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville has a rather unexpected cameo).  It is not a genteel recounting of history, but a bawdy and lurid tale.  The villains are bold, the good guys are likable, and Da Vinci is an unpredictable hero.  Much of the success of ""Da Vinci's Demons"" rests on the shoulders of Tom Riley, but it is a difficult and star-making performance.  I was always intrigued to see what he might do next.  Without his edge, volatility and humor, the program might easily have gone way off course.  I certainly liked the peripheral cast, but he is the clear MVP as you must be invested in this central character.  The show also benefits from lush production values, effects, visual design, costuming, and musical orchestration.  It all feels very expensive and well done.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[2, 3]","DA VINCI'S DEMONS is an intriguing cable television series; well acted and boasting rich production values that transport viewers back to Italy of the 1400s.The first season of the series, consisting of eight one-hour episodes, is a portrait of Leonardo Da Vinci (Tom Riley) as a young man, tortured by the gift of superhuman genius.  He lives in an age where he must take up the fight against powerful forces that use history, religion and politics to suppress the truth.  Indeed, his quest for knowledge almost becomes his undoing as he explores the fringes of his own sanity.As worthy as DA VINCI'S DEMONS might be, it does have its problems.  Primarily, it deals with a time in European history of which many people, including this writer, are not overly familiar.  Therefore, it would have been quite helpful if, at the start of the series, the producers had included some sort of narration or other device that would have put the story we were about to see into context.  The series also introduces multiple characters and plot lines so quickly and without explanation that much of the enterprise becomes confusing.  One continually wonders who are these characters, what are their relationships and why are they doing what they are doing?Aside from Riley, the excellent cast of the series includes Laura Haddock, Blake Ritson, Elliot Cowan, Gregg Chillin and Lara Pulver.DVD extras on the 3-disc set from Anchor Bay Entertainment include audio commentaries by series creator David S.

1643114,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00C7AO2J6,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[1, 2]","How does one even begin to describe this show? Part biography, part historic-political drama, part fabricated conspiracy (cueThe Da Vinci Codereferences), part buddy-comedy, with a smattering of courtroom dramas, supernaturally themed mysteries, and romantic intrigue - heck, there's even room for a guest-starring Vlad &#538;epe&#537;. Yes, *that* Vlad &#538;epe&#537;; also known as Count Dracula. In terms of plot, everything but the kitchen sink is packed into ""Da Vinci's Demons"", so much so that it's nearly impossible to keep track of the myriad of subplots that meander throughout the course of the eight-episode first season.Perhaps it's best described simply as a fictional account of Leonardo da Vinci's youth: his inventions, his associates, his adventures and his participation in various historical events. Set predominantly in 15th century Florence during the Renaissance, da Vinci is already notorious for his artistic skill, wild ideas, and unorthodox sexual practices. Played by Tom Riley as a sort of hyperactive savant, the viewer occasionally gets glimpses into the way his mind works - when a flock of birds is released, he sees them as moving sketches; when a new idea comes to him, we see the outline of his plan drawn in his mind before it's committed to paper.He's kind of like what would happen if you combined Tony Stark with Sherlock Holmes - rather selfish, intensely intelligent, somewhat anti-social, and yet immensely attractive *because of* rather than *in spite of* how wrapped up he is in his own little world.He fits into his current surroundings like a spark does with gunpowder. Florence and its de-facto rulers, the Medici family, are currently under immense pressure from Rome to submit to their control. Lorenzo de' Medici (Elliot Cowan), his brother Giuliano (Tom Bateman) and his wife Clarice (Lara Pulver) are all passionately defensive of Florence's beauty and independence, and forge a rather unlikely alliance with di Vinci in the hopes of maintaining its freedom.But on a more personal note, da Vinci is on a quest of his own. As the illegitimate son of a notary, he's always been an embarrassment to his father, and knows nothing of his mother save her name: Caterina. Over the course of the season he comes to realize that her disappearance may have something to do with a cult called the Sons of Mithras, whose members encourage him to seek out an artefact known as the Book of Leaves. This is where the inevitable resemblance toThe Da Vinci Codekicks in, for Leonardo's journey is filled with hidden clues strewn throughout various books, paintings, sculptures and architecture.I think even fans of the show would concede that the balancing act between these two plots is somewhat clumsy. The wider political intrigue and the cult storylines seldom intersect, and since both vie for screen-time it's difficult to decide which of the two should be considered the focus of the show. Furthermore, the two are so different in content and tone that I suspect most viewers will end up preferring one over the other - which means that for those interested in the Medici family's struggle to save Florence, Leonardo's obsession with his own past will seem irrelevant, whereas for those drawn into the mystery of the cult will wonder why so much time is being spend on political matters elsewhere. The cult storyline is embroiled in mysticism that doesn't really mesh with the overarching theme of rationality and science, giving one the feeling that the show wants to cherry-pick the ""exoticism"" of eastern cults but also commend the ""enlightenment"" of western civilization. In other words, it wants to have its cake and eat it too.That's not even getting into the various subplots involving Leonardo's dalliance with Lorenzo's mistress (Laura Haddock), who has an agenda of her own, but hey - perhaps you'll get lucky and find both plots equally captivating. In its favor, the hectic plots at least ensure that the show is never boring.As you might have expected from a Starz show, there is plenty of nudity and sex, though in this case male viewers will have more to appreciate - though there is no shortage of young naked women, the men who get their clothes off are invariably not quite as pleasing to the eye. There's also been some controversy concerning da Vinci's sexuality, for although the man himself is strongly believed to have been gay (though there's always room for debate), here he's best described as mildly bi-curious. All his love scenes are with women, and it's easy to feel as though some erasure has gone on - which is a shame. If any channel could have green-lit a program spearheaded by an openly gay main character, surely it would have been Starz.Finally, be warned that there's hardly any attempt to adhere to history accuracy - though you only need to glimpse the astounding outfits of the women to realize that. Though some famous events are touched upon (and the Pazzi Conspiracy makes up the greater part of the last two episodes), the show is content to work with its own rules and more-or-less make things up as it goes.So it all adds up to a rather disjointed show - though I'd personally rather watch something that takes risks and tries new things than treads the same familiar paths. I enjoyed da Vinci's little collection of comrades (sardonic Zoroaster, long-suffering Nicco, free-spirited Vanessa), the occasional nod to history, and the creative costumes, set design and general visual style. I mentioned at the start of this review that even Vlad &#538;epe&#537; pops in for a guest-starring role, but as it happens Paul Rhys puts in a chilling performance as the famous prince, making it one of the best portrayals of the famous figure in recent memory.One of the central themes is that of reason, logic and light overcoming superstition, but also a celebration of debauchery, creativity and sexual freedom over that which seeks to stifle and control - and in its boundless energy and originality, ""Da Vinci's Demons"" is a pretty perfect encapsulation of both these outlooks.",4,"""I am a

It leaves you hanging and the series won't be continued until 2014. I probably won't watch it again. The acting was overly dramatic yet did not have the drama effect expected, in some cases it was ludicrous when it was meant to be serious. DaVinci's character was poorly played but somewhat better than the others. What really disillusioned me about the series was the continuous mysteries with no answers at all. A few tidbits to understand the enigmas would have been welcome.Some episodes had nudity but it was done simply for effect and was unnecessary and sometimes vulgar. It seriously distracted from the story. Same for the swearing, done for effect but again distracts from the story. And both were inconsistent throughout the episodes. Had there been none of either, the focus would have remained on the story but my guess is the author thought the story too weak to survive without nudity and swearing.I also was hoping for an adaptation closer to actual history but not even close. The only aspects that resembles history are the names and the architecture. One episode where DaVinci meets Dracula had me laughing at the ludicrousness of this. It was as though the author could not make up his mind on where the story lines should go, have them resemble history? Have the stories mock history or have the stories spoof history? The inconsistency was throughout the series, in once instance it appears the story will attempt to follow history then the next it is like science fiction. It would have been much better to stick to one premise rather than be erratic.Were there any positives? To me, none that I recall. Overall the series was poorly and overly dramatically acted, the story lines were inconsistent and erratic. The fundamental premise that truth is being denied is never proven, never shown and unsupported. A few morsels of proof to solidify the premise would have made the series more believable but it just remained conjecture.If you are looking for a disjointed non-historical, fictional account of DaVinci and that era with nudity and swearing then you might like this series. If you prefer that it be closer to actual history, not have gratuitous nudity and swearing and be consistent in its approach, then you will probably not like this series.",1,"Disappointing, no basis in history.",1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,2351,"['was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'series', 'especially', 'ending', 'hanging', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'continued', '2014', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', 'acting', 'was', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'yet', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'drama', 'effect', 'expected', 'cases', 'was', 'ludicrous', 'when', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'serious', 'DaVinci', 'character', 'was', 'poorly', 'played', 'somewhat', 'better', 'others', 'What', 'really', 'disillusioned', 'series', 'was', 'continuous', 'mysteries', 'answers', 'A', 'few', 'tidbits', 'understand', 'enigmas', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome.Some', 'episodes', 'had', 'nudity', 'was', 'done', 'simply', 'effect', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'sometimes', 'vulgar', 'seriously', 'distracted', 'story', 'Same', 'swearing', 'done', 'effect', 'again', 'distracts', 'story', 'were', 'inconsistent', 'episodes', 'Had', 'been', 'none', 'focus', 'would', 'have', 'remained', 'story', 'guess', 'author', 'thought', 'story', 'too', 'weak', 'survive', 'nudity', 'swearing.I', 'also', 'was', 'hoping', 'adaptation', 'closer', 'actual', 'history', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'only', 'resembles', 'history', 'are', 'names', 'architecture', 'One', 'episode', 'where', 'DaVinci', 'Dracula', 'had', 'laughing', 'ludicrousness', 'was', 'author', 'could', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'where', 'story', 'lines', 'should', 'go', 'have', 'resemble', 'history', 'Have', 'stories', 'mock', 'history', 'have', 'stories', 'spoof', 'history', 'inconsistency', 'was', 'series', 'once', 'instance', 'story', 'will', 'attempt', 'follow', 'history', 'then', 'next', 'science', 'fiction', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'stick', 'one', 'premise', 'rather', 'be', 'erratic.Were', 'there', 'positives', 'none', 'recall', 'Overall', 'series', 'was', 'poorly', 'overly', 'dramatically', 'acted', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'inconsistent', 'erratic', 'fundamental', 'premise', 'truth', 'being', 'denied', 'never', 'proven', 'never', 'shown', 'unsupported', 'few', 'morsels', 'proof', 'solidify', 'premise', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'series', 'more', 'believable', 'just', 'remained', 'conjecture.If', 'are', 'looking', 'disjointed', 'non-historical', 'fictional', 'account', 'DaVinci', 'era', 'nudity', 'swearing', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'series', 'prefer', 'be', 'closer', 'actual', 'history', 'not', 'have', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'swearing', 'be', 'consistent', 'approach', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'series']",N/A

And I am so glad that I did!I am just about finished watching the series for a second time and really found that my opinion of it still held.  It is a very well done and intelligent series.  The show is a combination of The Borgias, Sherlock and Indiana Jones. But most of all it comes across as a live  action Alexander Dumas novel, complete with huge bombastic plot filled with conspiracies, secret societies swashbuckling and historical twists.The series involves a young Leonardo Da Vinci who is a genius, artist and inventor.  He's the illegitimate son of  one of Florence's  prominent citizens. However given his illegitimacy it bars him from a social standing to which he smarts against. On the surface Da Vinci's rebellion may seem as if he is just thumbing his nose at society. But as the series progresses you can see that he harbours inner hurt due to the fact that he is not recognized for his talents or for the fact that his parents rejected him (his mother abandoned the family) and the father resents Leo because he reminds him that the mother abandoned him.  I found it very interesting that for most of the show, there is a theme of characters personalities and actions being motivated by wanting to please their father. It was interesting.Leo manages to get himself a position  with the powerful Medicci family who influence Florence due to their wealth who are in a battle with the corrupt Pope in Rome.  He also gets entangled with Lorenzo's Di Medicci's mistress Lucrezia.There are also several sub-plots going on at the same time the most prominent one involving a secret society based called `The Sons of Mithras' whose over all goals are not yet revealed  but drives the plot.  But it has something to do with releasing knowledge to mankind which the Catholic Church .It's a very good show , which I would recommend to those who enjoy costume dramas and mysteries.",5,Fantastic!,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,2120,"['came', 'just', 'accident', 'decided', 'buy', 'sight', 'unseen', 'primarily', 'based', 'fact', 'love', 'costume', 'dramas', 'most', 'negative', 'reviews', 'read', 'had', 'do', 'fact', 'show', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'am', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'series', 'second', 'time', 'really', 'found', 'opinion', 'still', 'held', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'intelligent', 'series', 'show', 'combination', 'Borgias', 'Sherlock', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'most', 'live', 'action', 'Alexander', 'Dumas', 'novel', 'complete', 'huge', 'bombastic', 'plot', 'filled', 'conspiracies', 'secret', 'societies', 'swashbuckling', 'historical', 'twists.The', 'series', 'young', 'Leonardo', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'who', 'genius', 'artist', 'inventor', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'one', 'Florence', 'prominent', 'citizens', 'However', 'given', 'illegitimacy', 'social', 'standing', 'surface', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'rebellion', 'may', 'seem', 'just', 'thumbing', 'nose', 'society', 'series', 'can', 'see', 'inner', 'hurt', 'due', 'fact', 'not', 'recognized', 'talents', 'fact', 'parents', 'rejected', 'mother', 'abandoned', 'family', 'father', 'resents', 'Leo', 'mother', 'abandoned', 'found', 'very', 'interesting', 'most', 'show', 'theme', 'characters', 'personalities', 'actions', 'being', 'motivated', 'wanting', 'please', 'father', 'was', 'interesting.Leo', 'manages', 'get', 'position', 'powerful', 'Medicci', 'family', 'who', 'influence', 'Florence', 'due', 'wealth', 'who', 'are', 'battle', 'corrupt', 'Pope', 'Rome', 'also', 'entangled', 'Lorenzo', 'Di', 'Medicci', 'mistress', 'Lucrezia.There', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'sub-plots', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'most', 'prominent', 'one', 'involving', 'secret', 'society', 'based', 'called', 'Sons', 'Mithras', 'goals', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'revealed', 'plot', 'something', 'do', 'releasing', 'knowledge', 'mankind', 'Catholic', 'Church', '.It', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'would', 'recommend', 'who', 'enjoy', 'costume', 'dramas', 'mysteries']",N/A

The costumes are appropriate to the period, yet somehow have a contemporary feel and are all regal, elegant, and the women all look lovely. The men are all very sexy in leather. The soundtrack brings glorious drama to all the scenes and is worthy of a show about Leonardo DaVinci. The acting skills of all the actors is consistently excellent. With that said, my issue with the show is how DaVinci is portrayed. He was a true Renaissance man and was a painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer - amazing! But he was and is primarily remembered for being one of the greatest painters of all time.Yet the show portrays him as some kind of superhero who is swinging a sword, rather than showing him as the great intellectual he was. I understand the writers are trying to appeal to a modern audience and want to make the show &#34;cool&#34; but it's primary focus is on political intrigue and soap opera sexual relationships. I would like to see the focus move to DaVinci's life as an artist and have him put down the sword and pick up a paint brush. Do the writers think the show would be boring to explore DaVinci's artistic genius so they have to turn him into a superhero fighting with and getting involved with the political problems of the day? Also, DaVinci has often been identified as a homosexual. It is known that he had no close relationships with women during his life and that his intimate relationships are rumored to have been with his pupils. At the age of 24, he and three other young men were charged with sodomy (the charges were dismissed) and since then he kept his private life secret (many speculate that since he was gay he kept his personal secret out of fear of persecution). Both, this show portrays DaVinci having sex and romantic feeling towards women which just is not true. I wish the writers had the guts to portray DaVinci as true to who is really was, gay.  DaVinci had to hide his sexuality in the 1400's, and the writers today are still hiding it because, presumably, they don't think it would be good for ratings, they should be ashamed of themselves! Tell the truth, not what you think will sell best, let's have an accurate picture of the man and please, please let us see DaVinci actually painting and putting his efforts into creating a great masterpiece and what it takes to create a great painting, that would be interesting, not every show has to be filled with non-stop action to be entertaining.",1,Not a True Portrait of DaVinci,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,2641,"['First', 'all', 'show', 'magnificent', 'behold', 'cinematography', 'sets', 'scenery', 'are', 'are', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'are', 'appropriate', 'period', 'yet', 'somehow', 'have', 'contemporary', 'feel', 'are', 'regal', 'elegant', 'women', 'look', 'lovely', 'men', 'are', 'very', 'sexy', 'leather', 'soundtrack', 'glorious', 'drama', 'scenes', 'worthy', 'show', 'Leonardo', 'DaVinci', 'acting', 'skills', 'actors', 'consistently', 'excellent', 'said', 'issue', 'show', 'how', 'DaVinci', 'portrayed', 'was', 'true', 'Renaissance', 'man', 'was', 'painter', 'sculptor', 'architect', 'musician', 'mathematician', 'engineer', 'inventor', 'anatomist', 'geologist', 'cartographer', 'botanist', 'writer', 'amazing', 'was', 'primarily', 'remembered', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', 'painters', 'time.Yet', 'show', 'kind', 'superhero', 'who', 'swinging', 'sword', 'rather', 'showing', 'great', 'intellectual', 'was', 'understand', 'writers', 'are', 'trying', 'appeal', 'modern', 'audience', 'want', 'make', 'show', '34', 'cool', '34', 'primary', 'focus', 'political', 'intrigue', 'soap', 'opera', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'focus', 'move', 'DaVinci', 'life', 'artist', 'have', 'put', 'down', 'sword', 'pick', 'up', 'paint', 'brush', 'Do', 'writers', 'think', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'boring', 'explore', 'DaVinci', 'artistic', 'genius', 'have', 'turn', 'superhero', 'fighting', 'getting', 'involved', 'political', 'problems', 'day', 'Also', 'DaVinci', 'often', 'been', 'identified', 'homosexual', 'known', 'had', 'close', 'relationships', 'women', 'life', 'intimate', 'relationships', 'are', 'rumored', 'have', 'been', 'pupils', 'age', '24', 'three', 'other', 'young', 'men', 'were', 'charged', 'sodomy', 'charges', 'were', 'dismissed', 'then', 'kept', 'private', 'life', 'secret', 'many', 'speculate', 'was', 'gay', 'kept', 'personal', 'secret', 'fear', 'persecution', 'show', 'DaVinci', 'having', 'sex', 'romantic', 'feeling', 'towards', 'women', 'just', 'not', 'true', 'wish', 'writers', 'had', 'guts', 'portray', 'DaVinci', 'true', 'who', 'really', 'was', 'gay', 'DaVinci', 'had', 'hide', 'sexuality', '1400', 'writers', 'today', 'are', 'still', 'hiding', 'presumably', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'ratings', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'Tell', 'truth', 'not', 'what', 'think', 'will', 'sell', 'best', 'let', 'have', 'accurate', 'picture', 'man', 'please', 'please', 'let', 'see', 'DaVinci', 'actually', 'painting', 'putting', 'efforts', 'creating', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'what', 'create', 'great', 'painting', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'not', 'show', 'be', 'filled', 'non-stop', 'action', 'be', 'entertaining']",N/A

However, the creator's preoccupation with sexual encounters (male-female, male-male and male-young male) takes away from the story. While it may be historically accurate, I didn't need or want such graphic illustration. The opening sequence is a good example of getting the message across without resorting to shock and awe.The weakest link in the cast for me, is the actor playing da Vinci. The rest of the cast seem to fill their roles extremely well. The actor playing da Vinci's father does exceptionally well during the trial. Vlad was also a character/actor highlight.Probably pass on season two. With such rich material to pull from, it seems a bit lazy to go for nudity and sexual encounters so often. Perhaps if there was more history and less snogging?",2,Attempts to shock and create controversy take away from the series.,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,855,"['Certainly', 'good', 'subject', 'matter', 'series', 'considering', 'success', 'Rome', 'Borgias', 'However', 'creator', 'preoccupation', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'male-female', 'male-male', 'male-young', 'male', 'away', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'historically', 'accurate', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'want', 'such', 'graphic', 'illustration', 'opening', 'sequence', 'good', 'example', 'getting', 'message', 'resorting', 'shock', 'awe.The', 'weakest', 'link', 'cast', 'actor', 'playing', 'da', 'Vinci', 'rest', 'cast', 'seem', 'fill', 'roles', 'extremely', 'well', 'actor', 'playing', 'da', 'Vinci', 'father', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'trial', 'Vlad', 'was', 'also', 'character/actor', 'highlight.Probably', 'pass', 'season', 'two', 'such', 'rich', 'material', 'pull', 'bit', 'lazy', 'go', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'so', 'often', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'more', 'history', 'less', 'snogging']",N/A
