851907,A2ZS8TWUL1QTRH,B0002YLDI2,A.J. Dill,"[17, 20]","When I watched the first episode, I thought I had wasted my money. It looked like the show was going to have the plot that of a kiddy anime show in which the only thing that happens is characters just power up. So the DVD set just laid there gathering dust.I came back to the DVD a couple weeks ago to watch the second episode, and found out my intuition was wrong. Some very fun and intriging characters were introduced in the next episode. There was only one person I found a tiny bit annoying since she continually talks about this indecisive dream of hers, but it didn't throw me off. None of them are alike; their personalities all vary and there is always conflict.Talking more about conflict, there is a lot of fighting in the series. All the fights seems to have a unique twist, though, that keeps away the boredom factor. Plenty of time is spent plot developement too. The central theme of the plot seems to be about being too quick to judge and the bad effect of the opression of people. I hardly found it predictable, and there is always an unknown.I also have to give kudos to the people who did the music of the show. I can't remember one time that the music did not fit into the scene, and I found the beginning's song very catchy. I've seen quite a few anime shows in which the background music sounds a little too korny, but not in S.Cry.EdWhat keeps this show from getting five stars? I think it has to be the animation. Not that the animation itself is bad- actually it's very well done. The special effects are realistic and the character's faces never look disportional. The only problem is the coloring. Its very cheerful, light, as pretty as a rainbow. I think if the colors were dark and the characters were drawn more maturely, I think this show would be much more popular. The pretty colors give it a kiddy show feeling even though people die and there is cursing.I highly recommend this series, but I just have to tell you don't be too quick to judge like I was.",4,Need Just a Little Patience,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,1988,"['When', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'thought', 'had', 'wasted', 'money', 'looked', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'plot', 'kiddy', 'anime', 'show', 'only', 'thing', 'characters', 'just', 'power', 'up', 'DVD', 'set', 'just', 'laid', 'there', 'gathering', 'dust.I', 'came', 'back', 'DVD', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'watch', 'second', 'episode', 'found', 'out', 'intuition', 'was', 'wrong', 'very', 'fun', 'intriging', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'next', 'episode', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'found', 'tiny', 'bit', 'annoying', 'continually', 'indecisive', 'dream', 'hers', 'did', ""n't"", 'throw', 'off', 'None', 'are', 'alike', 'personalities', 'vary', 'always', 'conflict.Talking', 'more', 'conflict', 'lot', 'fighting', 'series', 'fights', 'have', 'unique', 'twist', 'though', 'away', 'boredom', 'factor', 'Plenty', 'time', 'spent', 'plot', 'developement', 'too', 'central', 'theme', 'plot', 'be', 'being', 'too', 'quick', 'judge', 'bad', 'effect', 'opression', 'people', 'hardly', 'found', 'predictable', 'always', 'unknown.I', 'also', 'have', 'give', 'kudos', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'music', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'one', 'time', 'music', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'scene', 'found', 'beginning', 'song', 'very', 'catchy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'anime', 'shows', 'background', 'music', 'little', 'too', 'korny', 'not', 'S.Cry.EdWhat', 'show', 'getting', 'five', 'stars', 'think', 'be', 'animation', 'Not', 'animation', 'bad-', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'realistic', 'character', 'never', 'look', 'disportional', 'only', 'problem', 'coloring', 'very', 'cheerful', 'light', 'as', 'pretty', 'rainbow', 'think', 'colors', 'were', 'dark', 'characters', 'were', 'drawn', 'more', 'maturely', 'think', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'popular', 'pretty', 'colors', 'give', 'kiddy', 'show', 'feeling', 'even', 'people', 'die', 'cursing.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'just', 'have', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'quick', 'judge', 'was']",S-Cry-Ed - The Complete Collection

My impressions? Well, it neither good or bad, it's just average. While it does have a story line that might or might not keep you interested (depending on what episode you're on), most of the ""action"" is sometimes way too repetitive, that it becomes rather boring after a while; and because of this, I just completely lost interest in by the 12th episode. It didn't really make a difference to me whether Kazuma or Ryuhou won...I was just like is that pretty much it? While there were a few moments of unexpected (and welcomed) surprises, the show pretty much never really took off.

851909,A2VF73N1AI95SQ,B0002YLDI2,Dylan,"[19, 21]","s-CRY-ed is a Japanese Anime series that tells the story of two young men named Kazuma and Ryuho. The story is about the people living on a part of Japan that broke off from the mainland during a great upheaval.  Now this island, known as the Lost Ground, is home to many people with strange abilities called alters. Alter users have the ability to break down matter and rematerialize it in a completely different form. One of our main characters, Ryuho, is an alter user and member of HOLY, a group of alter users created to work for the mainland and stop any native alters who get out of control. The other main character, Kazuma, is one such native alter who works by doing odd jobs to survive. Along their journies, these two clash many times and are constantly fighting.  The relationship that these two have with each other, and the people around them is basically what this show comes down to being all about.With a supporting cast featuring a wide range of strange and great characters such as Ms. Mimori, Kanami, Strait Cougar, Scheris Adjani, Martin Zigmarl, and Kimishima, it is easy to see how this show can grow on you. The battles are done fairly well, and are overall enjoyable to watch. You can usually find at least one character you can relate to, or root for. The main villain, Kyoji Mujo, doesn't enter until halfway through the series, though in my opinion his threat is second to the main story of the relationship between Kazuma and Ryuho.Though if you still don't know why this product deserves five stars, it is because all 26 episodes of the show, yes this series is short, are in this set. To get an entire series, especially an anime, for just over 30 dollars is in my opinion an incredible deal. Perhaps I am giving this anime too much credit, but I really enjoy it and do feel it deserves more appreciation. Of course, ultimately whatever you think of this anime is up to you to decide. If you haven't yet seen it, perhaps you should before actually buying it, though I don't believe you'd regret buying this. What's left to say?

I'm guessing the strange, nonsensical title, turns people off, I don't know.",5,One of the best ever.,1288310400,"10 29, 2010",2010,533,"[""'ve"", 'seen', '50', 'complete', 'anime', 'series', 'yet', 'one', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'DBZ', 'Gurren', 'Lagann', 'had', 'baby', 'would', 'be', 'action', 'awesome', 'story', 'great', 'characters', 'even', 'better', 'music', 'unique', 'artwork', 'animation', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'Kazuma', 'Ryuho', 'are', 'one', 'anime', 'greatest', 'rivalries', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'series', 'so', 'little', 'attention', 'was', 'actually', 'broadcast', 'while', 'Adult', 'Swim', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'strange', 'nonsensical', 'title', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know']",S-Cry-Ed - The Complete Collection

Generally, it is very exciting and draw my curiosity to the finale. As I refuse to expose the details, I can say I was excited while watching it. However, the finale might be a little disappointing, not about the result. It is about how it wraps up the stuff",3,The contents are exciting but...,1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,378,"['would', 'recommend', 'anime', 'action', 'anime', 'fans', 'Totally', 'lot', 'fightings', 'battlings', 'anime', 'Generally', 'very', 'exciting', 'draw', 'curiosity', 'finale', 'refuse', 'expose', 'details', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'excited', 'watching', 'However', 'finale', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'disappointing', 'not', 'result', 'how', 'up', 'stuff']",S-Cry-Ed - The Complete Collection

It is one of the few anime made post 2000 that still has the feel of an 80's/early 90's anime. The story is relatively simple. A part of japan becomes separated from the rest of the country. A small percentage of people in this area become born with special powers called alter powers. This area, referred to as the lost ground is split into two regions, one a bustling metropolis and the other a desert wasteland.In this anime there are two protagonists. One is Kazuma who is born in the wasteland of the lost ground. He has struggled to live up until now and is basically a mercenary who does odd jobs to to scrape by while supporting his two dearest friends. Ryuhou the other protagonist lives in the city, surrounded by a giant wall, he has decided that all free alters must be captured and detained. There is a reason for this but i am going to avoid spoilers. Long story short Ryuhou and Kazuma become enemies and face off numerous times throughout the series in high energy battles.This is an action series made for enjoyment, it may not be incredibly complex but there is a well thought out easy to understand message underlining the whole series. If you enjoy anime like DBZ and Bleach I say give this a shot. It's similar, although it attempts to make a big statement and tells a complete story within 26 episodes. I'll leave it here so I don't bore anyone, I recommend everyone to give this series a shot because It was one of my favorites growing up and I still enjoy it. Enjoy.Overall Rating 5/5",5,One of the Greats,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,1620,"['once', 'awhile', 'anime', 'way', 'people', 'look', 'anime', 'anime', 'was', 'Scryed', 'one', 'few', 'anime', 'made', 'post', '2000', 'still', 'feel', ""80's/early"", '90', 'anime', 'story', 'relatively', 'simple', 'part', 'japan', 'becomes', 'separated', 'rest', 'country', 'small', 'percentage', 'people', 'area', 'born', 'special', 'powers', 'called', 'alter', 'powers', 'area', 'referred', 'lost', 'ground', 'split', 'two', 'regions', 'one', 'bustling', 'metropolis', 'other', 'desert', 'wasteland.In', 'anime', 'are', 'two', 'protagonists', 'One', 'Kazuma', 'who', 'born', 'wasteland', 'lost', 'ground', 'struggled', 'live', 'up', 'now', 'basically', 'mercenary', 'who', 'odd', 'jobs', 'scrape', 'supporting', 'two', 'dearest', 'friends', 'Ryuhou', 'other', 'protagonist', 'lives', 'city', 'surrounded', 'giant', 'wall', 'decided', 'free', 'alters', 'must', 'be', 'captured', 'detained', 'reason', 'am', 'going', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'Ryuhou', 'Kazuma', 'become', 'enemies', 'face', 'off', 'numerous', 'times', 'series', 'high', 'energy', 'battles.This', 'action', 'series', 'made', 'enjoyment', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'easy', 'understand', 'message', 'underlining', 'whole', 'series', 'enjoy', 'anime', 'DBZ', 'Bleach', 'say', 'give', 'shot', 'similar', 'make', 'big', 'statement', 'complete', 'story', '26', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'here', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'bore', 'anyone', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'give', 'series', 'shot', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', 'growing', 'up', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Enjoy.Overall', 'Rating', '5/5']",S-Cry-Ed - The Complete Collection
