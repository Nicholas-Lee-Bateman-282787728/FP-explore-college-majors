1044031,A19XE6G6NDZFPS,B000M8HJL8,Joanna Mechlinski,"[10, 10]","Fans of The Mary Tyler Moore Show will enjoy this spinoff, starring Cloris Leachman as Phyllis Lindstrom, Mary's one-time friend and landlord. Now a widow, Phyllis moves with her teenage daughter Bess to San Francisco, where she stays with her mother-in-law Audrey while trying to build a new life.In the pilot, Phyllis and Bess have just arrived in California. At a reception for Lars' friends, Phyllis learns some unsettling information about her husband's past...and, to her horror, finds that the only job prospect coming her way is from Julie Erskine, the center of of it all.In the second episode, Bess heads off for a ski weekend with friends, much to Phyllis' nervousness. When she calls Bess' room, a male voice answers and says Bess is sleeping -- causing Phyllis hysterics over the possibility that her little girl isn't as innocent as she believed.Despite being a spinoff, ""Phyllis"" shows strength in its characters and comedy all on its own. It's a shame the series was so short-lived.",4,A good spinoff...,1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,998,"['Fans', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'will', 'enjoy', 'spinoff', 'starring', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'Phyllis', 'Lindstrom', 'Mary', 'one-time', 'friend', 'landlord', 'Now', 'widow', 'Phyllis', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Bess', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'mother-in-law', 'Audrey', 'trying', 'build', 'new', 'life.In', 'pilot', 'Phyllis', 'Bess', 'have', 'just', 'arrived', 'California', 'reception', 'Lars', 'friends', 'Phyllis', 'unsettling', 'information', 'husband', 'past', 'horror', 'only', 'job', 'prospect', 'coming', 'way', 'Julie', 'Erskine', 'center', 'second', 'episode', 'Bess', 'off', 'ski', 'weekend', 'friends', 'much', 'Phyllis', 'nervousness', 'When', 'Bess', 'room', 'male', 'voice', 'answers', 'Bess', 'sleeping', 'causing', 'Phyllis', 'hysterics', 'possibility', 'little', 'girl', ""n't"", 'as', 'innocent', 'being', 'spinoff', 'Phyllis', 'strength', 'characters', 'comedy', 'own', 'shame', 'series', 'was', 'so', 'short-lived']",N/A
1044032,AG8U6F6226GBZ,B000M8HJL8,Lotte,"[3, 3]","She had the best Spin Off, of anyone from MTM.  She was better than the Rhoda spin off, because not only was she an excellent actress and funny, but the characters around her were also.The characters around Rhoda (especially the men) were idiots on her Spin Off.  I never thought Rhoda's parents were funny, and they're in too many scenes.  The sister is a good actress, but the writing for her wasn't very good.  Rhoda was funnier on MTM than on her own show, not because of Rhoda, but because the writers who wrote for her on MTM were so much better than the writers of her Spin Off.Phyllis's show was much better.  Sorry they didn't give us a complete Spin Off of Phyllis on DVD.As for Ted.  I'm grateful that they did not do a spin off of him as Ted.  If they did, I missed it.  Whoever wrote for him, was awful.  He wasn't funny, he was boring, stupid, and mean.  Not to mention there was far too much of him in every show.",5,Phyllis was short changed.,1340496000,"06 24, 2012",2012,928,"['had', 'best', 'Spin', 'Off', 'anyone', 'MTM', 'was', 'better', 'Rhoda', 'spin', 'off', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'excellent', 'actress', 'funny', 'characters', 'were', 'also.The', 'characters', 'Rhoda', 'especially', 'men', 'were', 'idiots', 'Spin', 'Off', 'never', 'thought', 'Rhoda', 'parents', 'were', 'funny', ""'re"", 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'sister', 'good', 'actress', 'writing', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Rhoda', 'was', 'funnier', 'MTM', 'own', 'show', 'not', 'Rhoda', 'writers', 'who', 'wrote', 'MTM', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'writers', 'Spin', 'Off.Phyllis', 'show', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'complete', 'Spin', 'Off', 'Phyllis', 'DVD.As', 'Ted', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'spin', 'Ted', 'did', 'missed', 'Whoever', 'wrote', 'was', 'awful', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'was', 'boring', 'stupid', 'mean', 'Not', 'mention', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'show']",N/A
