1570335,A1MECEHZHFE5PT,B008MH9OXW,"Dayna Newman ""Slasher Diva""","[3, 3]","I just watched The Perfect House as it is now on Fios on Demand..I really enjoyed it. For having a small budget the lighting,Music and effects were very well done and there were a few actors that really stood out such as Jonathan Tiersten as 'John Dosey' one of the Psychotic house owners who gets off on torturing people every Thursday with an audience present in the form of a woman that he has had captive for five years and by the looks of her teeth he doesn't provide a dental plan..Felissa Rose who in the credits is listed only as 'Mother', both of whom were in the highly successful cult classic ""Sleepaway Camp"" and The most recent ""Return To Sleepaway Camp"".Dustin Stevens as 'The Stranger' was also a stand out..This was a very entertaining and gory tale of a House with a History and we are treated to three different tales of horror and gore that took place inside the house.I have been waiting forever to see this because it has been sold out on Amazon for quite some time now.This could have very easily been overly cheesy and ineffective but it was treated in such a way that it all came together beautifully.I was impressed.""CHIC-KEN"" starring Tiersten is my favorite of the trilogy the others being ""DINNER GUEST"" and ""The Storm""...",4,I get fed on Wednesdays and Raped on Fridays,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,1250,"['just', 'watched', 'Perfect', 'House', 'now', 'Fios', 'Demand..I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'having', 'small', 'budget', 'lighting', 'Music', 'effects', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'were', 'few', 'actors', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'such', 'Jonathan', 'Tiersten', ""'John"", 'Dosey', 'one', 'Psychotic', 'house', 'owners', 'who', 'off', 'torturing', 'people', 'Thursday', 'audience', 'present', 'form', 'woman', 'had', 'captive', 'five', 'years', 'looks', 'teeth', ""n't"", 'provide', 'dental', 'plan..Felissa', 'Rose', 'who', 'credits', 'listed', 'only', ""'Mother"", 'whom', 'were', 'highly', 'successful', 'cult', 'classic', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'most', 'recent', 'Return', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', '.Dustin', 'Stevens', ""'The"", 'Stranger', 'was', 'also', 'stand', 'out..This', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'gory', 'tale', 'House', 'History', 'are', 'treated', 'three', 'different', 'tales', 'horror', 'gore', 'took', 'place', 'house.I', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'forever', 'see', 'been', 'sold', 'out', 'Amazon', 'quite', 'time', 'now.This', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'easily', 'been', 'overly', 'cheesy', 'ineffective', 'was', 'treated', 'such', 'way', 'came', 'together', 'beautifully.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'CHIC-KEN', 'starring', 'Tiersten', 'favorite', 'trilogy', 'others', 'being', 'DINNER', 'GUEST', 'Storm']",N/A

Like, anthology films rarely (trying to think of an exception) aim to be celebrated as some masterwork (not unlike many nonanthology films). Just tyring to adjust expectations. This one harkens back to the old days, but not quite to the Amicus era who put out a few good anthologies, but around the 80s. Its not set then but it has that vintage flavor. Technology does not exist here, unless you count a weedwacker (hahaha, inside joke if you've seen it). The Perfect House is a mean one. It starts off with a vignette that doesn't get finished till the end but sets the tone just right. Then the real estate woman enters the picture. LOL wonder how many houses she sells. Anyway we are then introduced to vignette 1, which is good, though I'd rate it #3 out of the 3 vignettes. I like the quick movements during the 'lights out' pivotal moment. Then #2 comes along and I struggle to choose between #2 and #3 for first place. I really enjoyed #2. Quite sick, sadistic, and funny dialogue at times. #3 tells the story that was set up in the beginning. I really liked it. OK- I will give it first place. The dinner host was really good. I love his way of teaching lessons.So, The Perfect House was the perfect choice for me, at the end of the night, when I was getting ready to retire.

The family hiding in the basement during a storm is, well, passable...and completely predictable, but a wild shrew mother chews scenery well.
