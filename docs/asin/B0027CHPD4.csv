As such, she is unable to finish college and becomes a secretary who is about to get fired. So she does the only thing she can - she pretends she is pregnant to avoid getting laidoff.

1253904,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B0027CHPD4,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[2, 3]","A young woman, with a self-centered boyfriend, is stuck in a secretarial job, but when her boss is out of town, she assumes greater responsibilities, falls for an executive, and succeeds, brilliantly...only to be 'caught' when her boss returns, losing everything, until her contributions are fully recognized and appreciated. While this neatly sums up Lindsay Lohan's 2009 ""Labor Pains"", it is actually a brief synopsis of Melanie Griffith's 1988 hit, ""Working Girl"". While the gimmick of a faked pregnancy adds a degree of topical relevance to the mix (as well as a stream of gags about the embarrassing side effects of carrying a child), ""Labor Pains"" never succeeds in being more than a pale copy of the earlier film.The problem with the film isn't Lohan, who gives a very credible performance as a likable, self-sacrificing workaholic struggling to juggle an underappreciated job, supporting a younger sister, and a relationship, while keeping her sanity; the problem is a shallow, superficial script by Stacey Kramer and Lara Shapiro, and Shapiro's heavy-handed direction, lacking the lightness and polish that Mike Nichols gave the earlier film. The pregnancy 'con', itself, is poorly conceived (can you think of any business with more than a dozen employees without some form of medical plan, or accepting the claim on face value, alone?), and the lack of any symptoms or signs would have aroused somebody's suspicions (besides the geeky kid trying to pass Lohan on the career ladder). Then there are the shaky characterizations, from the intellectually-challenged, chauvinist, dog-fixated boss (who inexplicably becomes a caring soul in the final scene), to the equally-challenged first boyfriend (why would Lohan even date such an idiot?), to the rude, unlikable younger sister. Lohan's new love interest totters from wimpy to sincere and back, and even her best friend (Cheryl Hines), after a nice character build-up in the first half of the film, is reduced to nearly a background player by film's end. Other than Bonnie Somerville's terrific performance, as a pregnant author who introduces Lohan to the world of 'living for two', the supporting cast are all nearly caricatures.That the film 'works', at all, is due to Lindsay Lohan, and if you are buying this to see her, you'll enjoy this film...if you aren't, I suggest purchasing ""Working Girl"", instead!",3,"Gimmick-Driven Retooling of ""Working Girl""...",1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,2370,"['young', 'woman', 'self-centered', 'boyfriend', 'stuck', 'secretarial', 'job', 'when', 'boss', 'town', 'greater', 'responsibilities', 'falls', 'executive', 'brilliantly', 'only', 'be', ""'caught"", 'when', 'boss', 'returns', 'losing', 'everything', 'contributions', 'are', 'fully', 'recognized', 'appreciated', 'neatly', 'up', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', '2009', 'Labor', 'Pains', 'actually', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', '1988', 'hit', 'Working', 'Girl', 'gimmick', 'faked', 'pregnancy', 'degree', 'topical', 'relevance', 'mix', 'as', 'well', 'stream', 'gags', 'embarrassing', 'side', 'effects', 'carrying', 'child', 'Labor', 'Pains', 'never', 'being', 'more', 'pale', 'copy', 'earlier', 'film.The', 'problem', 'film', ""n't"", 'Lohan', 'who', 'very', 'credible', 'performance', 'likable', 'self-sacrificing', 'workaholic', 'struggling', 'juggle', 'underappreciated', 'job', 'supporting', 'younger', 'sister', 'relationship', 'keeping', 'sanity', 'problem', 'shallow', 'superficial', 'script', 'Stacey', 'Kramer', 'Lara', 'Shapiro', 'Shapiro', 'heavy-handed', 'direction', 'lacking', 'lightness', 'polish', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'gave', 'earlier', 'film', 'pregnancy', ""'con"", 'poorly', 'conceived', 'can', 'think', 'business', 'more', 'dozen', 'employees', 'form', 'medical', 'plan', 'accepting', 'claim', 'face', 'value', 'alone', 'lack', 'symptoms', 'signs', 'would', 'have', 'aroused', 'somebody', 'suspicions', 'geeky', 'kid', 'trying', 'pass', 'Lohan', 'career', 'ladder', 'Then', 'are', 'shaky', 'characterizations', 'intellectually-challenged', 'chauvinist', 'dog-fixated', 'boss', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'caring', 'soul', 'final', 'scene', 'equally-challenged', 'first', 'boyfriend', 'why', 'would', 'Lohan', 'even', 'date', 'such', 'idiot', 'rude', 'unlikable', 'younger', 'sister', 'Lohan', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'totters', 'wimpy', 'sincere', 'back', 'even', 'best', 'friend', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'nice', 'character', 'build-up', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'reduced', 'nearly', 'background', 'player', 'film', 'end', 'Other', 'Bonnie', 'Somerville', 'terrific', 'performance', 'pregnant', 'author', 'who', 'Lohan', 'world', ""'living"", 'two', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'nearly', 'caricatures.That', 'film', 'due', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'are', 'buying', 'see', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'purchasing', 'Working', 'Girl', 'instead']",N/A

Even though the plot is predictable, it has a few funny twists and turns. It doesn't just run on pregnancy jokes.The acting is overall pretty decent. Lohan actually comes off well, not unbelievable good nor really annoying, but rather as a frustrated person stuck in a worthless job. I wasn't familiar with the other actors but they all came across as pretty believable and not too over the top (one of the things that can kill a movie like this is overly dramatic acting - seeManagement).The movie does suffer from what I call the ""1.5 hour problem"" - it tries to cram so many relationships and a lot of plot twists within 90 minutes. Unfortunately, that seems to be the typical trend in Hollywood nowadays. Nonetheless, parts of the film, such as Lohan's relationship with Nick, seem a bit forced.For some reason (possibly Lohan's trouble with the press), this movie slipped under the radar of most movie-goers, but it doesn't deserve to stay there.

It's one of those see it just to see it movie.

But Lilo had so impressed me in her sheer ability to carry a bad movie by sheer talent; (as in that clunker ""I Know Who Killed Me."") Here again  Lohan doesn't dissappoint, still managing to hold you captive with a screen presence that just doesn't quit, even when the writing or directing is not that great.The movie was funny and just slapstick enough to strain - but not break - credibility (once you accept the whole premise). I liked it for fun and enjoyment; I might even buy it. It also serves to remind us that Lindsay Lohan is only one good role away from an Oscar-winning performance. Hines and Mendler are excellent as well.I am surprised by the complete trouncing by the critics. I think it is possible that critics -and a great deal of the public - get 'mud-colored glasses' on when they smell blood in the water - as with Lohan, Spears, and anyone else who appears vulnerable. They may love-to-hate, but I do know I very much enjoyed watching Lindsay Lohan act in this movie.",5,Lohan superb; surprised at movie,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,1053,"['poor', 'reviews', 'waited', 'DVD', 'expecting', 'very', 'little', 'Lilo', 'had', 'so', 'impressed', 'sheer', 'ability', 'carry', 'bad', 'movie', 'sheer', 'talent', 'clunker', 'Know', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Me', 'Here', 'again', 'Lohan', ""n't"", 'dissappoint', 'still', 'managing', 'hold', 'captive', 'screen', 'presence', 'just', ""n't"", 'quit', 'even', 'when', 'writing', 'directing', 'not', 'great.The', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'just', 'slapstick', 'enough', 'strain', 'not', 'break', 'credibility', 'accept', 'whole', 'premise', 'liked', 'fun', 'enjoyment', 'might', 'even', 'buy', 'also', 'remind', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'only', 'one', 'good', 'role', 'away', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'Hines', 'Mendler', 'are', 'excellent', 'well.I', 'am', 'surprised', 'complete', 'trouncing', 'critics', 'think', 'possible', 'critics', '-and', 'great', 'deal', 'public', 'get', ""'mud-colored"", 'glasses', 'when', 'smell', 'blood', 'water', 'Lohan', 'Spears', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'vulnerable', 'may', 'love-to-hate', 'do', 'know', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'act', 'movie']",N/A
