Jones ""Andy""","[0, 0]","TV feels inundated with sitcoms, but Modern Family manages to rise about most of the crowd with its interesting characters and unique brand of humor.  From the opening episode I was hooked, with each of the three families being followed offering a different 'feel' but each being equally funny.  The show follows a format of three separate storylines in most episodes, which it usually manages to tie together in the end with some kind of unified theme.  It is an interesting format, and the writers have really made it work.Season 2 is well worth checking out if you were a fan of the previous season.  The families manage to grow and adapt just enough to keep their characters interesting, but without hurting the original formula that makes the show work.",5,Great follow-up to season 1,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,758,"['TV', 'feels', 'inundated', 'sitcoms', 'Modern', 'Family', 'rise', 'most', 'crowd', 'interesting', 'characters', 'unique', 'brand', 'humor', 'opening', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked', 'three', 'families', 'being', 'followed', 'offering', 'different', ""'feel"", 'being', 'equally', 'funny', 'show', 'format', 'three', 'separate', 'storylines', 'most', 'episodes', 'usually', 'tie', 'together', 'end', 'kind', 'unified', 'theme', 'interesting', 'format', 'writers', 'have', 'really', 'made', 'work.Season', '2', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'were', 'fan', 'previous', 'season', 'families', 'manage', 'grow', 'adapt', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'characters', 'interesting', 'hurting', 'original', 'formula', 'show', 'work']",Modern Family: Season 2

1350085,A3R7PQAHD3NZM0,B003L77G06,Autumn Blues Reviews,"[1, 1]","My review of Modern Family was totally non-biased as I have never watched this show before. Originally I had wanted to, but just never set aside time. I was very excited to review the Modern Family Complete Second Season. I was immediately drawn to this funny crazy cast of characters in the Modern Family series. Gloria (Sof&iacute;a Vergara), is a blast, and since she is Colombian on the show and I am Hispanic, my Latin blood can relate to many of what goes on with her on the show. Gloria is loud just as many Latin woman are and I could totally relate to her feelings when Jay (Ed O'Neill), her husband mocks her or makes fun of her accent. One of the funnier episodes has Gloria ordering those tiny cheeses that she calls baby cheeses. Unfortunately for her and Jay, when the order arrives it contained baby Jesus's instead of cheeses. Manny (Rico Rodriguez), the 11 year old son of Gloria, is a quirky little character who drinks many cups of espresso daily. Manny drinking espresso was something I did not find unusual, since Hispanics allow children to drink coffee, but my husband thought it to be insane. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), the grown son of Jay, lives with his partner Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) and their adopted Vietnamese daughter. The two men are total opposites. Mitchell is the sensitive one who stays home, and Cameron is the provider who always seems to get his way. One of my favorite episodes with Mitchell and Cameron is where Mitchell has found a new fashion, wearing bicycle shorts and Cameron does not have the heart to tell him how bad they look and that he should stop wearing them. My husband and I both roared throughout all the episodes! We now need to back track and watch season one, as we would love to see how these quirky characters all came to be. We are now hooked on Modern Family and are now permanent fans of this great series! I also loved watching all the extras on the disc, the deleted family interviews, extended and deleted scenes, the hilarious gag reel and the music video. I give this Modern Family Complete Season Blu-ray 3-Disc set 5 stars all the way.",5,Non-stop entertainment and laughs!,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,2118,"['review', 'Modern', 'Family', 'was', 'totally', 'non-biased', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'Originally', 'had', 'wanted', 'just', 'never', 'set', 'aside', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'review', 'Modern', 'Family', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'was', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'funny', 'crazy', 'cast', 'characters', 'Modern', 'Family', 'series', 'Gloria', 'Sof', 'iacute', 'Vergara', 'blast', 'Colombian', 'show', 'am', 'Hispanic', 'Latin', 'blood', 'can', 'relate', 'many', 'what', 'show', 'Gloria', 'loud', 'just', 'many', 'Latin', 'woman', 'are', 'could', 'totally', 'relate', 'feelings', 'when', 'Jay', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'husband', 'fun', 'accent', 'One', 'funnier', 'Gloria', 'ordering', 'tiny', 'cheeses', 'baby', 'cheeses', 'Unfortunately', 'Jay', 'when', 'order', 'contained', 'baby', 'Jesus', 'instead', 'cheeses', 'Manny', 'Rico', 'Rodriguez', '11', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Gloria', 'quirky', 'little', 'character', 'who', 'many', 'cups', 'espresso', 'daily', 'Manny', 'drinking', 'espresso', 'was', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'unusual', 'Hispanics', 'allow', 'children', 'drink', 'coffee', 'husband', 'thought', 'be', 'insane', 'Mitchell', 'Jesse', 'Tyler', 'Ferguson', 'grown', 'son', 'Jay', 'partner', 'Cameron', 'Eric', 'Stonestreet', 'adopted', 'Vietnamese', 'daughter', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'total', 'opposites', 'Mitchell', 'sensitive', 'one', 'who', 'home', 'Cameron', 'provider', 'who', 'always', 'get', 'way', 'One', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'Mitchell', 'Cameron', 'where', 'Mitchell', 'found', 'new', 'fashion', 'wearing', 'bicycle', 'shorts', 'Cameron', 'not', 'have', 'heart', 'tell', 'how', 'bad', 'look', 'should', 'stop', 'wearing', 'husband', 'roared', 'episodes', 'now', 'need', 'back', 'track', 'watch', 'season', 'one', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'how', 'quirky', 'characters', 'came', 'be', 'are', 'now', 'hooked', 'Modern', 'Family', 'are', 'now', 'permanent', 'fans', 'great', 'series', 'also', 'loved', 'watching', 'extras', 'disc', 'deleted', 'family', 'interviews', 'extended', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'hilarious', 'gag', 'reel', 'music', 'video', 'give', 'Modern', 'Family', 'Complete', 'Season', 'Blu-ray', '3-Disc', 'set', '5', 'stars', 'way']",Modern Family: Season 2
1350086,A1KBT3D1O0LA7L,B003L77G06,A. White,"[0, 0]","This is one of the best shows on TV right now and everybody has a great acting chemistry with each other. I will never be able to find a ""reality"" show as entertaining as good old-fashioned scripted performances, be they live-action or animated. Phil is easily the funniest on the show, with Cam a close second. I just can't look at Ed O'Neil and not think Al Bundy, and I'm sure that's the case for many people. That in no way takes away from this show but Married With Children is a classic, and I'm sure will have more seasons under its belt than this show will. The biggest problem(s) with this show IMO is Luke, the kid just can't act, or to put it more accurately he OVER acts. He tries to be this semi-retarded (sorry not PC) yet still innocently funny and it just doesn't work out for him. Maybe in future seasons he will have matured a bit more and this behavior will stop. Another aspect that has bothered me, for nearly every show in the last few decades, is why does everything have to take place in either LA or NY? This question isn't related to the show per se, but there are other parts of the US and the world besides those two places and it would be nice to see them more often.",4,Better Than the First,1321574400,"11 18, 2011",2011,1196,"['one', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'right', 'now', 'everybody', 'great', 'acting', 'chemistry', 'other', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'reality', 'show', 'as', 'entertaining', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'scripted', 'performances', 'be', 'live-action', 'animated', 'Phil', 'easily', 'funniest', 'show', 'Cam', 'close', 'second', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'Ed', ""O'Neil"", 'not', 'think', 'Al', 'Bundy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'case', 'many', 'people', 'way', 'away', 'show', 'Married', 'Children', 'classic', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'seasons', 'belt', 'show', 'will', 'biggest', 'problem', 's', 'show', 'IMO', 'Luke', 'kid', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'put', 'more', 'accurately', 'OVER', 'be', 'semi-retarded', 'sorry', 'not', 'PC', 'yet', 'still', 'innocently', 'funny', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'Maybe', 'future', 'seasons', 'will', 'have', 'matured', 'bit', 'more', 'behavior', 'will', 'stop', 'aspect', 'bothered', 'nearly', 'show', 'last', 'few', 'decades', 'why', 'everything', 'have', 'take', 'place', 'LA', 'NY', 'question', ""n't"", 'related', 'show', 'se', 'are', 'other', 'parts', 'US', 'world', 'two', 'places', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'often']",Modern Family: Season 2
1350087,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B003L77G06,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[22, 22]","When ""Modern Family"" premiered in the fall of 2009, it was a breath of fresh air. An incredibly brilliant, well written and acted series depicting family life of the Pritchett/Dunphy clan. It was one of the best things I had seen on network TV in years. From start to finish, the debut season was an instant classic, and the show deservedly got the attention from critics and award shows. But then came the obvious question. Can they do it again? Was the show a one season wonder? Would they suffer from the ever dreadful 'sophomore slump'? When season two premiered in the fall of 2010, it was apparent right away, especially with the first few episodes, that any fears or doubt were instantly washed away. Season 2 premiered as strong as ever, and rolled out 24 high quality episodes. But first....A little catch up. The series features Pritchett family patriarch, Jay (the fantastic Ed'o'Neill), who is married to a much younger columbian woman named Gloria (Sofia Vergara), and step-father to Manny. His daughter Claire (Julie Bowen) is married to Phil (Ty Burrell), and they have three children, Haley, Luke, and Alex. Jay's son Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) lives with his partner, Cameron (the hilarious Eric Stonestreet) and their adopted daughter, Lily.Season 2 got things off on the right foot. The season premiere, ""The Old Wagon"", was a strong welcome back that showcased everything that makes the show so great. Humor and heart. The episode dealt with Phil finally deciding to get rid of the old family car, but not without one last trip down memory lane. One of the season's best episodes for sure. Next up is ""The Kiss"". The show had had some controvery surrounding the gay characters of Mitchell and Cameron never kissing. This hilarious episode focuses on Mitchell's growing concern of Cameron's reluctance to show passion in public. It was such a well done episode that made the ballyhoo surrounding it into nothing, as the episode handled it in such a normal, natural way, and didn't make a big deal out of it. Brilliant! Episode 3, ""Earthquake"", was supposed to be the season premiere, but was pushed back to be the 3rd episode. It doesn't take much to figure out what the episode is about. ""Unplugged"" is a great episode that features Phil and Claire persuading the kids to all give up their electronical devices and learn to communicate better with each other. ""Halloween"" is another instant classic. Claire goes all out for the holiday and has everyone playing a part, but of course, it doesn't go too well. Elsewhere, ""Caught In The Act"" is an unflinchingly funny and honest episode where the 3 Dunphy kids catch their parents 'in the act '. Valentine's Day laughs return in the hilarious ""Bixby's Back"", and Nathan Lane shines as a Mitchell/Cam buddy who befriends Jay in ""Boys' Night"". ""See You Next Fall"" deals with Alex's middle school graduation, and the hilarity that ensues trying to get there. The season ends with Jay's birthday and him just wanting to go fishing, but his family has other plans in ""The One That Got Away"". There's so much more!Some say season 2 DID in fact suffer from a sophomore slump, but I just don't see it. The second half of the season isn't as strong as the first, but that doesn't mean anything. It's still great. The overall season is yet another testament to the great writing, acting, and directing that was established in season one. Each character is still fully fleshed out and with their own unique personalities. The incredibly talented cast continue to make their charcaters full fledged, fully fleshed out characters we love, care about, and laugh with. It doesn't hurt that the writing is so sharp, so clever, so relatable, and the humor as top notch as ever, for the actors to once again display why they are the best ensemble cast on television. I love how the show never shys away from the sweet moments, how almost every episode ends with something nice. That's just not something you get a lot of on television these days. It's the show that not only makes me laugh, but can also move me and make me feel for these people. I can't remember the last time I said that about a network television show.The season 2 set also comes pretty well packed with special features. Just like the season 1 set, it comes with Deleted Family Interviews, Deleted And Extended Scenes, and a Gag Reel. For the rest, we are treated to 6 featurettes (2 more than season 1) and a music video for ""Imagine Me Naked"", the song Dylan wrote for Haley. The new featurettes are ""At Home With Modern Family"", ""Modern Family Holidays"", ""Mitch's Flash Mob"", ""Strangers On A Treadmill - Table Read"", ""Waiting For Oprah"", and ""Chatting With Steve Levitan"".Season 2 of ""Modern Family"" is worth every penny. Some special guests include Shelley Long, Matt Dillon, Natahn Lane, Elizabeth Banks, and more. In addition to it's cast, it can't help but have great guest stars too! Simply put, ""Modern Family"" is divine television. The rare show that deserves all the hype, all the praise, and gives me hope for network comedy. Season 2 is great.

In this second season I have discovered more the hilarity of yet other cast members in this family ensemble.  Yes, one of my favorites, Cam, is terrific this time with his godawful school musical production.  He is determined to turn a grammar school musical into a Sondheim like production and is hilarious while doing so.  However, Phil, the son-in-law in the series, is just as funny with one of his usual blunders.  He made this ad for his real estate practice which shows his whole family.  The ad in print is fine but he has it painted onto his van as well and the painters have to wrap it around the van.  Now the ad looks like the ad for a prostitution ring with his wife and teen daughter as the two prime hookers.  They haven't noticed yet and Phil is desperate to keep them away from the van.

It includes the entire second season and a few extras (though not many).The case is slim, and the discs all stay put pretty well.  I'm happy with the quality of packaging.  Now onto the show.I watched the second season originally from the local library (yes my library has many copies of this season), though it took me a few weeks to get bumped up on the request list.  I had recently finished season one and was craving more of the delightful comedy of this series.Though season one may have been a little more fun, there is plenty of hilarity during this season.  For those who don't know, this series was created by the team that brought Frasier to us.  Quality shows both.  The writing is excellent and the actors play well to their talents and stay true to their characters.What this show is about is making odd family and lifestyle situations work in a crazy and fast paced world.  The show is actually set up as a Scandanavian reality show.  I don't know if this was ever mentioned on the actual show, but it is mentioned on the website and mentioned during the commentary in season one.  I think it was for Norwegian television.  They wanted a reality show showing a slice of American family life.  So that is why you have the periodic asides where family members talk to the camera, or the occasional sideways glance at the camera during normal scenes.If you haven't seen the show, you should probably catch a few of the early episodes of season one, but it is not required.  There aren't really any spoilers and each episode pretty much stands alone with few story arcs carrying over to multiple episodes.One actor who delighted me by appearing was Nathan Lane playing 'Pepper'.  Hilarious!This is not your ordinary family life drama.  It features one somewhat normal appearing household that ends up being the most dysfunctional of the bunch, a gay couple with an adopted Asian daughter, and an older, rich guy with a much younger, hot Colombian wife and her son.

1350114,A3A9UCRADPMCT8,B003L77G06,James Horlan,"[0, 0]","Like many second seasons of comedies, Modern Family fell short of the heights of its debut.  The nice thing is, the debut was so high, a short fall like this still results in really good comedy, with flashes of greatness.The setting and characters of the show are the same as in Season One, nobody new is introduced and no one leaves.  That allows the characters to get comfortable with each other even more......too comfortable in some cases, though it's nothing too excessive.  The show's breakout character has clearly become Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell), the dippy father/husband/son-in-law who badly wants to do the right thing and be cool at the same time.  That doesn't often work, but Phil is so earnest in what he does that you just smile and want to pat him on the head.  Not sure if I would want him as a father, but he'd be the best uncle alive.  His wife Claire (Julie Bowen), is still wound tight during this season, and some her explosions are very, very funny.  Again, wouldn't want her as a mother......or an aunt.  She's funny to watch on TV though, and she and Burrell both deserved the Emmy's they got  for this season.  Their kids got a bit more to do, as Hailey (Sarah Hyland)had boy problems, as well as concerns about her future.......Alex (Ariel Winter) has to decide between being smart and being popular.....and Luke (Nolan Gould) seems destined to be his dad, they're so much alike it's scary.The three Dunphy kids' storylines came at the expense of Manny (Rico Rodriguez), who had less to do this season unfortunately, though he and Jay (Ed O'Neill) still play off each other brilliantly.  In many ways this is the most interesting relationship in the show, Jay's third attempt at fatherhood, and his failures and successes with Manny don't go unnoticed  by his adult children, not always a good thing.  It leads to some interesting subtext in the relationships between Jay and his children, I hope they do more with it.  Gloria (Sofia Vergara) is a bit over the top this season, and her yelling could be used to torture prisoners, but Vergara successfully continues to steer Gloria away from the antagonist role that one would have assumed she'd have when the series started.Mitchell and Cameron (Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet) are where the series has it's first real issues.  Cameron is becoming a bit much to deal with, with his over the top antics and ""me, me, and more me"" diva personality.  The character seems to have the need to take over any scene he's in, and he's a bit clueless to boot.  I'm not saying that he has an emotionally abusive relationship with Mitchell, but I can see a few ways it could be going there.  I'm sure it's the performance that the show runners want, given that it's not changed through the first four episodes of the current season, but the less Cameron the better. Ferguson's Mitchell is notable in that he has some nice, quiet moments during the season that really say a lot about him.....and a couple of loud ones too, the subplot where Jay has dinner with Mitchell and Cameron and their friends is terrific, and you can see Mitchell looking at his father like he doesn't really know who he is.  Also notable with these two characters is their daughter Lily, played by twins who never once, to my recollection, change their facial expression, no matter what the hijinks going on around them.  I found it fascinating, in a good way, and was disappointed to see the role recast for the current season.Overall this is a great season, as the family continues it's issues, fun, and growth.  Outside characters are kept to a minimum, most are merely MacGuffins anyway, though there was some nice stunt casting at times.  Modern Family continues to hold a slim, but noticeable lead over Big Bang Theory as my favorite comedy, and I look forward to more adventures of the next months.Five stars.",5,"What Are You Waiting For, Put This In Your Cart",1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,3865,"['many', 'second', 'seasons', 'comedies', 'Modern', 'Family', 'fell', 'short', 'heights', 'debut', 'nice', 'thing', 'debut', 'was', 'so', 'high', 'short', 'fall', 'still', 'results', 'really', 'good', 'comedy', 'flashes', 'greatness.The', 'setting', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'same', 'Season', 'One', 'nobody', 'new', 'introduced', 'one', 'characters', 'get', 'comfortable', 'other', 'even', 'more', 'too', 'comfortable', 'cases', 'nothing', 'too', 'excessive', 'show', 'breakout', 'character', 'clearly', 'become', 'Phil', 'Dunphy', 'Ty', 'Burrell', 'dippy', 'father/husband/son-in-law', 'who', 'badly', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'be', 'cool', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'often', 'work', 'Phil', 'so', 'earnest', 'what', 'just', 'smile', 'want', 'pat', 'head', 'Not', 'sure', 'would', 'want', 'father', ""'d"", 'be', 'best', 'uncle', 'alive', 'wife', 'Claire', 'Julie', 'Bowen', 'still', 'wound', 'tight', 'season', 'explosions', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'Again', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'mother', 'aunt', 'funny', 'watch', 'TV', 'Burrell', 'deserved', 'Emmy', 'got', 'season', 'kids', 'got', 'bit', 'more', 'do', 'Hailey', 'Sarah', 'Hyland', 'had', 'boy', 'problems', 'as', 'well', 'concerns', 'future', '.Alex', 'Ariel', 'Winter', 'decide', 'being', 'smart', 'being', 'popular', '..and', 'Luke', 'Nolan', 'Gould', 'destined', 'be', 'dad', ""'re"", 'so', 'much', 'scary.The', 'three', 'Dunphy', 'kids', 'storylines', 'came', 'expense', 'Manny', 'Rico', 'Rodriguez', 'who', 'had', 'less', 'do', 'season', 'unfortunately', 'Jay', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'still', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'brilliantly', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'interesting', 'relationship', 'show', 'Jay', 'third', 'attempt', 'fatherhood', 'failures', 'successes', 'Manny', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'unnoticed', 'adult', 'children', 'not', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'interesting', 'subtext', 'relationships', 'Jay', 'children', 'hope', 'do', 'more', 'Gloria', 'Sofia', 'Vergara', 'bit', 'top', 'season', 'yelling', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'torture', 'prisoners', 'Vergara', 'successfully', 'steer', 'Gloria', 'away', 'antagonist', 'role', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'assumed', ""'d"", 'have', 'when', 'series', 'started.Mitchell', 'Cameron', 'Jesse', 'Tyler', 'Ferguson', 'Eric', 'Stonestreet', 'are', 'where', 'series', 'first', 'real', 'issues', 'Cameron', 'becoming', 'bit', 'much', 'deal', 'top', 'antics', 'more', 'diva', 'personality', 'character', 'have', 'need', 'take', 'over', 'scene', 'bit', 'clueless', 'boot', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'Mitchell', 'can', 'see', 'few', 'ways', 'could', 'be', 'going', 'there', ""'m"", 'sure', 'performance', 'show', 'want', 'given', 'not', 'changed', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'current', 'season', 'less', 'Cameron', 'better', 'Ferguson', 'Mitchell', 'notable', 'nice', 'quiet', 'moments', 'season', 'really', 'say', 'lot', '..and', 'couple', 'loud', 'ones', 'too', 'subplot', 'where', 'Jay', 'dinner', 'Mitchell', 'Cameron', 'friends', 'terrific', 'can', 'see', 'Mitchell', 'looking', 'father', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'who', 'Also', 'notable', 'two', 'characters', 'daughter', 'Lily', 'played', 'twins', 'who', 'never', 'once', 'recollection', 'change', 'facial', 'expression', 'matter', 'what', 'hijinks', 'going', 'found', 'fascinating', 'good', 'way', 'was', 'disappointed', 'see', 'role', 'recast', 'current', 'season.Overall', 'great', 'season', 'family', 'issues', 'fun', 'growth', 'characters', 'are', 'kept', 'minimum', 'most', 'are', 'merely', 'MacGuffins', 'anyway', 'was', 'nice', 'stunt', 'casting', 'times', 'Modern', 'Family', 'hold', 'slim', 'noticeable', 'lead', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'adventures', 'next', 'months.Five', 'stars']",Modern Family: Season 2

Better than a lot of the shows on TV, to say the least.But the second season wasn't quite as good. It went to the well of Cam-as-stereotypical-overzealous-diva once too many, and while Ed O'Neill and Rico Rodriguez gave very good performances, some parts of the season just fell flat. Certain storylines were cliched, and the show was somewhat overshadowed in my mind by better comedies ('Community', 'Parks and Recreation' and 'Louie' for example). Two episodes that perfectly encapsulate what I feel Modern Family hit a bit of a sophomore slump: ""Our Children, Ourselves"" and "" The Musical Man'.(Possible spoilers?)The first had a storyline involving an increasingly convoluted plot involving Mitchell mistaking a little person for a child (which could have been ripped straight from a '50s era sketch comedy) while the second is just really predictable. The jokes fall flat and you can tell exactly what's going to happen. As soon as I saw the ad that Phil was going to put on the side of the truck, I knew that the joke was that it looked like Phil was whoring out his wife, daughter, et al. And it's not that predictability is always bad, but the show didn't feel as fresh or interesting this season.In short, Modern Family season 2 had a lot of good jokes and plenty of good episodes... but it felt more like a traditional sitcom and less, well, funny.Grade: 3.5/5",3,"Average, in a word.",1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,1465,"['Modern', 'Family', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', ""'ll"", 'say', 'was', 'sort', 'fresh', 'original', 'funny', 'Better', 'lot', 'shows', 'TV', 'say', 'least.But', 'second', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'went', 'well', 'Cam-as-stereotypical-overzealous-diva', 'once', 'too', 'many', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Rico', 'Rodriguez', 'gave', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'parts', 'season', 'just', 'fell', 'flat', 'Certain', 'storylines', 'were', 'cliched', 'show', 'was', 'somewhat', 'overshadowed', 'mind', 'better', 'comedies', ""'Community"", ""'Parks"", 'Recreation', 'example', 'Two', 'episodes', 'perfectly', 'encapsulate', 'what', 'feel', 'Modern', 'Family', 'hit', 'bit', 'sophomore', 'slump', 'Children', 'Ourselves', 'Musical', 'Man', 'Possible', 'spoilers', 'first', 'had', 'storyline', 'involving', 'increasingly', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'involving', 'Mitchell', 'mistaking', 'little', 'person', 'child', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ripped', 'straight', ""'50s"", 'era', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'second', 'just', 'really', 'predictable', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'can', 'tell', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'As', 'soon', 'saw', 'ad', 'Phil', 'was', 'going', 'put', 'side', 'truck', 'knew', 'joke', 'was', 'looked', 'Phil', 'was', 'whoring', 'out', 'wife', 'daughter', 'al', 'not', 'predictability', 'always', 'bad', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'season.In', 'short', 'Modern', 'Family', 'season', '2', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'jokes', 'plenty', 'good', 'episodes', 'felt', 'more', 'traditional', 'sitcom', 'less', 'well', 'funny.Grade', '3.5/5']",Modern Family: Season 2
