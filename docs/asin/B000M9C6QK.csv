1044341,A1FSTEHSQ4SPKH,B000M9C6QK,C.N.,"[0, 0]","This DVD is basically one longer 'episode' of how the Duggar's built their massive 7,000 square-foot home.  We liked seeing how a family with no prior building experience built an entire house.  Pretty neat.  I like that they made the whole process a learning adventure and used it in their homeschooling to educate their children, teaching them numerous skills.  Very fun to watch.  This is back when the Duggar's used to wear flowery dresses and have puffy hair.

It's nice to see good quality programs on cable. They seem like a well grounded Christian family, and it's interesting to see how such a large family lives with daily pressures and also homeschool. They are a great example how God can sustain families when you put your trust in His provision. Way to go Duggars!  God bless them...they're expecting #18 this year.",5,Tune into TLC for more,1220400000,"09 3, 2008",2008,481,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'show', 'available', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'recording', 'have', 'caught', 'Duggar', 'shows', 'TLC', 'nice', 'see', 'good', 'quality', 'programs', 'cable', 'seem', 'well', 'grounded', 'Christian', 'family', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'such', 'large', 'family', 'daily', 'pressures', 'also', 'homeschool', 'are', 'great', 'example', 'how', 'God', 'can', 'sustain', 'families', 'when', 'put', 'trust', 'provision', 'Way', 'go', 'Duggars', 'God', 'bless', ""'re"", 'expecting', '18', 'year']",N/A

I did not read the fine print and assumed this had several shows on like all the other DVDs. This was just a 1 hour special. It is a little cheesy and low budget compared to the other DVD/shows that they currently have.,2,Duggar Fans,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,294,"['family', 'really', 'Duggar', 'DVDs', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'fine', 'print', 'assumed', 'had', 'several', 'shows', 'other', 'DVDs', 'was', 'just', '1', 'hour', 'special', 'little', 'cheesy', 'low', 'budget', 'compared', 'other', 'currently', 'have']",N/A

I am more impressed with them than any other family I have met or seen. Even if you don't understand or like the ""rules"" of their family you can't argue with the results. I think if more people lived by even a few of their philosophies and were consistent we all would have a better life. Get to know them, and you'll be inspired.
