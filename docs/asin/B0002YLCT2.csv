This movie was made in the 1960s and has primitive film coloring and a horrid sound track that grates.The acting is competent though not inspired, which earns the movie two stars rather than one, and there were a few interesting and entertaining devices. One can imagine how daring this must have been for the period in which it was released. The plot, which is most unusual, earns some credit by its originality, at least among movies, if not books.However, overall the film takes a sordid, bleak and depressing view of the subject matter, which is typical of older films.  The politician is portrayed as snobbish, cold, controlling, humorless and unlikable. The youth, who is supposed to be sixteen, can't be a day younger than thirty. The courtship (mentioned above in the movie description) does not exist, as the young man is simply plucked out of a classroom with no explanation. The movie description would have you believe this film is somehow deeper, sensitive or more intelligent than it actually is.At best, this film is a crude rip-off of ""Dorian Gray"". At worst, it's an indulgence of the grossest stereotypes from yesteryear.This was probably judged a fair film for the genre back when it was one of a very few, but nowadays there are so many other, better films available, that I cannot imagine any reason for bothering with this one, other than nostalgia, which probably is the excuse for the positive reviews you read here.",2,Dated film that shows its age,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,1486,"['Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', '2004', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1960s', 'primitive', 'film', 'coloring', 'horrid', 'sound', 'track', 'grates.The', 'acting', 'competent', 'not', 'inspired', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'rather', 'one', 'were', 'few', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'devices', 'One', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'daring', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'period', 'was', 'released', 'plot', 'most', 'unusual', 'credit', 'originality', 'least', 'movies', 'not', 'books.However', 'overall', 'film', 'sordid', 'bleak', 'depressing', 'view', 'subject', 'matter', 'typical', 'older', 'films', 'politician', 'portrayed', 'snobbish', 'cold', 'controlling', 'humorless', 'unlikable', 'youth', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'sixteen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'day', 'younger', 'thirty', 'courtship', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'description', 'not', 'exist', 'young', 'man', 'simply', 'plucked', 'classroom', 'explanation', 'movie', 'description', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'film', 'somehow', 'deeper', 'sensitive', 'more', 'intelligent', 'actually', 'best', 'film', 'crude', 'rip-off', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'worst', 'indulgence', 'grossest', 'stereotypes', 'yesteryear.This', 'was', 'probably', 'judged', 'fair', 'film', 'genre', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'nowadays', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'better', 'films', 'available', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'reason', 'bothering', 'one', 'other', 'nostalgia', 'probably', 'excuse', 'positive', 'reviews', 'read', 'here']",The Everlasting Secret Family
851833,AFFOUXPFSRW94,B0002YLCT2,"Dr. Rob ""Rob""","[2, 2]","The film, The Everlasting Secret Family, is the adaptation of Frank Moorehouse's novella of the same name.The action opens on what appears to be an intramural track and field event fundraiser for a private, exclusive Australian preparatory school. The camera follows a sleek, dark greyish Roll-Royce limousine onto the school grounds. A blonde haired youth, soon to be the focus of the viewer attention has been watching this limousine approach and its passenger as he exits the car and seeks out either the Headmaster or the Chairman of the Trustees. This passenger turns out to be the Senator, a tall, slender, distinguished, proper gentleman. The Senator makes his connection with his intended contact and soon both men are pointing in the direction of the Youth. Three men sit at a table facing out to the track and field competition--the closest to the camera at this table is the art master (learned a bit later in the action of the movie). When the school connection makes eye contact with the art master, the art master nods what will be taken as assent regarding the Youth and the transaction that has just been approved for this teen boy. This very subtle, very discrete, very discerning, yet very deceptive contract has extraordinarily sinister connotations for the Youth and the larger Australian society. What is introduced in a most sophisticated manner is the workings of an elitist secret fraternal order and its place in the management, control, and operation of the privileged elitist society.Interestingly, this opening scene does not indicate so much the preparatory school as a brothel, but more as an genteel, protective male hareem from which confines powerful men select, handsome teen males as long-term lovers as companion-consorts. These youths are objects of desire and pleasure for the powerful men, such as the Senator, who become mentors to the Youthful lovers. This is similar to the situation of Ancient Greek culture in which the sons of the elite were temporarily housed with mentors. The mentors gave their knowledge, gifts, and love freely to their youthful ward companions until they were of majority age. This is exactly the situation involving the Youth who has become the focus of this film. There is a twist, a sinsister one, this Youth is to be seen and not heard--he does not need to have an opinion or even questions about anyting. According to the Senator, the Youth is to be young, handsome, and available when needed, as necessary, and with no questions asked. This is the second instance of the element of sinster connotations being raised. One should think of the Youth as a male courtesan.Gradually, through this film the secret brotherhood, The Everlasting Secret Family, is discussed. These discussions are never direct or even complete. What is known of the ESF is that it is venerable, has a history, initiates/inducts members, has degrees of membership similar to the degrees of the Masons or Knights of Columbus, but is made up of MADE homosexual men. This ESF has at least one presiding officer (initially, the old Judge also a mentor to the Youth) and at least a historian and an archivist. The former is overtly placed in the film, and shown officiating at an induction ceremony, in which the inductees are attired in all white outfits (rather ironic given that the ESF operates mostly through the practice of purposeful deception and discretion, with discernment arising only as a part of purposeful manipulation of others). The latter offices are inferred from the Judge's dialogues with the Youth.The Judge is an interesting character of this film. One would expect that the Judge as the ESF presiding officer would be zealous in maintaining the discipline of the rules that govern the ESF. Yet, he is shown as having hit a ceiling within his career as a judicial appointee. It is not stated whether the Senator withheld support from promoting the Judge further in the judiciary or that this elderly man plateaued and is somewhat bitter at the paradox of defending an organization that is amoral and illegal against his judicial oath. The Judge is very clearly drawn to the Youth. He desires the boy, but he does not push himself on the Youth because the Judge is proper in his behavior and interpretation of ESF rules. Unlike the Senator who wants only a sexual object, the Judge wants a real companion who questions and wishes to share his thoughts and desires with the Judge as well as an intimate relationship so the Judge is looking for a true, complete intimate companion consort.This film raises a number of issues that are teased at--never fully answered. One issue is what becomes of the Youthful lovers as they age out of being handsome/beautiful boys to men? How are they provided for? Have the Youths' parents been compensated for services rendered? One of these Youths is raised by name--Peter--presumably, the present Youth's immediate predecessor as the Senator's boy-lover. It is learned that the Senator arranged for Peter to live at Honolulu, Hawaii. Eric, is another one time lover of either the Senator, or more likely, the Senator's father. His current status is the Senator's driver. He seems to be a henchman thug/driver/enforcer/watchdog meant to prevent episodes of indiscretion involving the Youthful lover. These are but a few of the more intriguing ones.The film is meant to be disturbing. It is very clearly a study of human interactions, manipulation, power, control, even domination and humiliation as means to an end. In this regard it is masterful.I would have liked to have seen more character development especially of the following characters: the Senator; the Youth; the Judge; the Senator's son.This is a film worth viewing.",4,"The Interplay of Desire, Discretion, Discernment and Deception",1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,5725,"['film', 'Everlasting', 'Secret', 'Family', 'adaptation', 'Frank', 'Moorehouse',

The set-up involves a senator (played by Arthur Dignam), aided by a widespread network, who has arranged to take on a high school Youth lover (played by Mark Lee).  The Youth adapts, but needs to navigate challenges as the senator's life evolves.The direction and pacing are excellent.  There are many twists, all with a counterpoint of fears and regrets expressed in side story lines.  There are several successful sets involving parties and public meals.  The ending is delightfully wicked.The two main eye-candy characters, the Youth and one other, both supply good skin shots.The major cheat of the movie is that these two attractive characters seem to be played by actors in their late twenties, rather than in their early and middle teens as the written script would suggest.  (Of course, ""Hamlet"" won an Oscar with Olivier at 40.)  Reimagining the movie with age-accurate actors gives it a different feel.The DVD has some cheating too.

In a way, it's refreshing to see a movie where a gay underground puts the screws to a listlessly banal straight society.",4,"Fascinating, Evil Little Tale!",1099440000,"11 3, 2004",2004,593,"['Everlasting', 'Secret', 'Family', 'fascinating', 'Australian', 'film', 'secret', 'homosexual', 'society', 'infiltrated', 'silent', 'subtle', 'way', 'very', 'upper', 'strata', 'Australian', 'politics', 'upper', 'class', 'life', 'wicked', 'sexy', 'tale', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'plot', 'lest', 'ruin', 'clever', 'make', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining.Suffice', 'say', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'direction', 'fluent', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'quirky', 'twists', 'plot', 'way', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'where', 'gay', 'underground', 'screws', 'listlessly', 'banal', 'straight', 'society']",The Everlasting Secret Family
