1520465,A35X5JMZE3MPKY,B006W4KVK2,"Astral ""Astral""","[23, 24]","The Lalaloopsy dolls are huge right now, and they have finally made the transition from toy to the little screen.  It was rather successful, if you are looking for a cute, completely inoffensive movie that anyone can watch.  The main seven original Lalaloopsy dolls are the focus of the movie, along with Rosy Bumps and Bruises and four of the Lalaloopsy littles - the sister dolls and all of their respective pets.  It's the little sisters that make the show so cute and adorable, as they toddle around, saying things in a childish, simple manner that's quite endearing and very much like little bitty sisters do.  The older Loopsies are very sweet and understanding.  They have all personalities but are definitely nice girls, every single one of them, and they play off well with each other.  This is a refreshing change from having a few ""nasty"" characters in the mix, like with other series.  In Lalaloopsy Land, everyone is considerate, caring and nice.The plot is all about Peanut Big Top's surprise she is going to show everyone at dark.  The girls can't wait and are passing the time until then when they notice that Pillow Featherbed went off to find a ball they were playing with and didn't come back.  They organize a search for her and get caught up in some sew sweet antics and a little storm along the way.  Don't worry, nothing harrowing has happened to Pillow, she's simply napping again, as she seems a touch narcoleptic.  The simple story is wrapped up nice with a happy ending and a great big bow.  Some of the cinematography was quite impressive as well, with some unusual camera angles and transitions, as the camera follows the animals around.  This made a nice touch.  It's also done in flash-like animation style, which is a relief after the deluge of poorly done CGI movies. This one doesn't look like it was done in someone's basement on 1990s computers (like the Bratz series, which has horrible animation), it has a paper doll kind of style that really suits the characters, and everything is bright and smooth, and in widescreen to boot!Adventures in Lalaloopsy Land: The Search for Pillow is good spirited fun.  Older girls will like it because it is about their favorite characters, and the littlest ones can watch it with their sisters because there really is nothing objectionable at all about this movie.  Nothing.  It is pure sew sweetness from start to finish.  Which is really nice, as there are not a lot of movies that can appeal to a wide range of youngsters out there these days.  A very relaxing movie, and quite enjoyable.  It's one long ""D'aaaaaaaaaaaw"".",5,A Movie That is Sew Sweet for EVERYONE!,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,2599,"['Lalaloopsy', 'dolls', 'are', 'huge', 'right', 'now', 'have', 'finally', 'made', 'transition', 'toy', 'little', 'screen', 'was', 'rather', 'successful', 'are', 'looking', 'cute', 'completely', 'inoffensive', 'movie', 'anyone', 'can', 'watch', 'main', 'seven', 'original', 'Lalaloopsy', 'dolls', 'are', 'focus', 'movie', 'Rosy', 'Bumps', 'Bruises', 'four', 'Lalaloopsy', 'sister', 'dolls', 'respective', 'pets', 'little', 'sisters', 'make', 'show', 'so', 'cute', 'adorable', 'toddle', 'around', 'saying', 'things', 'childish', 'simple', 'manner', 'quite', 'endearing', 'very', 'much', 'little', 'bitty', 'sisters', 'do', 'older', 'Loopsies', 'are', 'very', 'sweet', 'understanding', 'have', 'personalities', 'are', 'definitely', 'nice', 'girls', 'single', 'one', 'play', 'off', 'well', 'other', 'refreshing', 'change', 'having', 'few', 'nasty', 'characters', 'mix', 'other', 'series', 'Lalaloopsy', 'Land', 'everyone', 'considerate', 'caring', 'nice.The', 'plot', 'Peanut', 'Big', 'Top', 'surprise', 'going', 'show', 'everyone', 'dark', 'girls', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'are', 'passing', 'time', 'then', 'when', 'notice', 'Pillow', 'Featherbed', 'went', 'find', 'ball', 'were', 'playing', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'organize', 'search', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'sew', 'sweet', 'antics', 'little', 'storm', 'way', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'nothing', 'harrowing', 'happened', 'Pillow', 'simply', 'napping', 'again', 'touch', 'narcoleptic', 'simple', 'story', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nice', 'happy', 'ending', 'great', 'big', 'bow', 'cinematography', 'was', 'quite', 'impressive', 'well', 'unusual', 'camera', 'angles', 'transitions', 'camera', 'animals', 'around', 'made', 'nice', 'touch', 'also', 'done', 'flash-like', 'animation', 'style', 'relief', 'deluge', 'poorly', 'done', 'CGI', 'movies', 'one', ""n't"", 'look', 'was', 'done', 'someone', 'basement', '1990s', 'computers', 'Bratz', 'series', 'horrible', 'animation', 'paper', 'doll', 'kind', 'style', 'really', 'suits', 'characters', 'everything', 'bright', 'smooth', 'widescreen', 'boot', 'Adventures', 'Lalaloopsy', 'Land', 'Search', 'Pillow', 'good', 'spirited', 'fun', 'Older', 'girls', 'will', 'like', 'favorite', 'characters', 'littlest', 'ones', 'can', 'watch', 'sisters', 'really', 'nothing', 'objectionable', 'movie', 'Nothing', 'pure', 'sew', 'sweetness', 'start', 'finish', 'Which', 'really', 'nice', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'movies', 'can', 'appeal', 'wide', 'range', 'youngsters', 'there', 'days', 'very', 'relaxing', 'movie', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'long', ""D'aaaaaaaaaaaw""]",Adventures in Lalaloopsy Land: The Search for Pillow
