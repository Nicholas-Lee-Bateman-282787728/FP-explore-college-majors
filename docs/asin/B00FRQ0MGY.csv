I really don't care what Fleming did in bed with his women, but the screenplay wants to tar him with a fetish for S&M. This might go a long way towards explaining his objectification of the &#34;weaker&#34; SEX, except that the woman he most brutalizes is also the one he feels most tenderly toward! Dominic Cooper is perfect in the role of Fleming, if not quite Bond, and the actress playing his mother made her character sufficiently loathesome. The action scenes in Germany had a kind of comic book feel to them, and that might have been fine if the adventurer in question were Bond, but it was a bit jarring in the case of the historical Fleming. I liked Fleming best when he was exchanging suggestive remarks with Miss Moneypenny, er, Monday.

Fleming has his flaws and quite a few of them: a taste for the good life, a bit of an inferiority complex, and a lust for sensual women to name a few. Yet, he finds his calling at the outset of World War II when Britain needs imaginative people to figure out ways to thwart the Germans. This first episode quickly established Fleming's pedigree as well as his foibles. It then gets on to the business of his new job, albeit a little hastily. All the while, groundwork is laid for the future, namely Fleming's attraction to a few women who may or may not be dangerous. Superb acting, very high production value, and a well-written script take you into the world in grand style. There are a few moments of melodrama and they only do wonders for an already great production.

The first three episodes were highly engaging and exciting, but I felt the steam leaving the story. Instead of delving deep into Fleming&#8217;s character, the show took an all too familiar path of sexual appetites. Seriously? Once his character of playboy was established, was it necessary for episodes three and four to center around his escapades? For me, it wasn&#8217;t. I was looking for more substance with the espionage side. Is that asking too much?When I realized the last segment was going to attempt to cover the war from 1942 to 45, I choose not to watch it. And oddly, BBC America, which constantly keeps rerunning their shows, has yet to even touch the series. That tells me, the viewing audience didn&#8217;t pan out for them.Dominic Cooper was an excellent choice for Bond. He was engaging, exciting and mysterious. It was reminiscent of Sir Alex Guinness portraying Adolph Hitler in &#8220;The Ten Days of Hitler.&#8221; Superb performance.My advice, if you want to see Ian&#8217;s formative years, the first three are well worth the view.

1673322,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00FRQ0MGY,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","Looking over a brief biography of Ian Fleming, it's a wonder his life wasn't adapted into a television drama long ago. A failed stockbroker, a naval intelligence officer during the Second World War, a love affair with a married woman, a bestselling author - it's a life-story that's ripe for dramatization.Divided into four forty-five minute episodes ""Fleming"" stretches from the cusp of WWII to 1956, when he completes his first novelCasino Royalewhilst on honeymoon in Jamaica. That said, it's important to note that this miniseries isn't about the thought-process that goes into the creation of James Bond (the heavily-promoted scene that has Ian and his brother discuss potential names for his hypothetical spy is actually one of the show's final scenes), but rather explores a period of Ian Fleming's life that may have inspired the famous books.Ian is an abysmal stockbroker and part-time playboy who feels constantly in his brother's shadow, referring to himself as ""the other Fleming"" on introductions. A man who enjoys drinking, smoking, gambling and women, he's also the type who smiles at the announcement that war has broken out, seeing it his chance to finally prove himself. Each episode explores his exploits in the war effort (mostly espionage and the accumulation of information) as well as his torrid love affair with Anne O'Neill, a woman not only married to an army officer, but already engaged in an open affair with another man.Obviously, this isn't a wholly accurate portrayal of Ian Fleming's life, and even a quick glimpse over his Wikipedia article demonstrates that plenty of things have been changed for dramatic effect. But it beautifully captures the atmosphere of the period (the clothing, the technology, the slang) and contains plenty of fun in-jokes regarding the people and places that eventually inspire him to create James Bond. A particular treat is his rapport with female Second Officer Monday, a droll but sympathetic woman who is clearly the prototype for Moneypenny, and possibly the only woman in the entire series that Fleming actually respects.And in many ways, the miniseries attempts to portray Fleming himself as the original Bond, embroiled in espionage and surrounded by beautiful women. Embodying the arrogant nonchalance that's only attractive to women in fiction (specifically Bond films) Dominic Cooper is a good fit for the lead role, portraying Fleming as a generally decent man with significant feet of clay and a flair for storytelling. Annabelle Wallis and Lara Pulver are his inevitable ""bond girls"" - one a sweet and innocent blonde, the other a dark and tempestuous brunette, with Anna Chancellor as the aforementioned Second Officer Monday (I guarantee she'll end up your favourite).It's worth mentioning that the ""romance"" between Fleming and Ann is anything but, and a lot of viewers may be put-off by the amount of physical aggression and emotional pain that typifies their relationship. The sex scenes aren't what I'd call explicit, but the show makes it clear that there's definitely bondage and violence involved (Ann is often depicted with bruises during post-coital scenes). This is naturally meant to be a reflection of Bond's forceful pursuit of women in the novels, but consider yourself warned if you're disturbed by this sort of thing. Fleming and Ann may end the miniseries together, but it's clear that their attraction is based on the utter havoc they wreck in each other's lives.It's a bit of a shame that the creation James Bond comes so late in the miniseries, for Fleming's desperate need to be impressive (as depicted throughout all four episodes) could have made for some interesting psychological parallels in his depiction of the ever-suave, ever-extravagant Bond (was Fleming perhaps compensating for something...?) As it happens, the series *does* wink at the audience a couple of times when it comes to Fleming's propensity for storytelling, particularly when his on-screen depiction of a dangerous mission behind enemy lines is later hinted to be an entire fabrication.And as it happens, I'm a little disappointed that they never snuck in the fact that Fleming was also (eventually) the author ofChitty Chitty Bang Bang.
