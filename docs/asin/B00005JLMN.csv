602384,A1PCESNDC808ZM,B00005JLMN,Charles Griffin,"[4, 4]","I've loved this mini-series since I first viewed it on CBS in the 80's (that network seemed to have all my favorites of that era: CHIEFS, A CHRISTMAS CAROL with George C. Scott, THE CAINE MUTINY COURT-MARTIAL, JACK THE RIPPER and LONESOME DOVE...all classics). But the old VHS tape on which I recorded CHIEFS is long gone, it's time for this mini-series to get a proper DVD release! I recently watched a special edition DVD box set of SHOGUN (helmed by CHIEFS director Jerry London), and it is a 5-disc beautifully remastered set with excellent video quality and 5.1 surround sound. I see no reason why CHIEFS can't receive the same treatment! In fact, I've heard the mini-series has been released in other countries with a 4-disc set...that would be ideal. 3 discs for the film and 1 for special features. I have a feeling it will happen soon, especially considering I've seen other mini-series as WINDS OF WAR available on DVD at the local stores!

This movie also deals with racial relations in the south during these different time periods.The actors were all terific, especially Billy Dee Williams and Wayne Rogers.  Both were exactly as I pictured their characters.The ending was especially touching when Billy Lee discovers that Tyler Watts is really Joshua Cole, a boyhood friend long lost.  This ending is different from the book, in which Billy Lee never learns who Tyler Watts is.Parts of this is sad, when Will Henry Lee and Marshall Peters are killed.  This is a tear jerker.Keith Caradine was perfect in the role of Foxy, who was a very menacing and scary guy.I hope to see this on DVD soon.  Does anyone know why this is not available?

Since I learned that a TV adaptation of the book was made, I've always wanted to see it - and, about a year ago, I finally found and bought the DVD release of the series (which seems to be unavailable outside R2). I actually did not expect much, but what I received surprised me - and it was a positive surprise. The series is an excellent adaptation of the novel and manages to do it justice, which is a rarity... as is the fact that very little of the book's plot is omitted. Certainly, some of the details - such as Will Henry's growing obsession with the mysterious murders, and the technical sides of his investigation - have to be treated superficially, but every important subplot and aspect of the book is present in the film; consequently, the series manages to be just as thrilling and involving as the novel. Amusingly enough, the credits on the box of the DVD misled me slightly - I assumed Charlton Heston, Keith Carradine and Billy Dee Williams would be playing the three chiefs, chronologically; of course, this is not the case. Of course, a Collector's Edition, with some extras and a commentary (perhaps even by Stuart Woods?) would be even better, since the DVD I have is bare-bones, with only a spartan menu and chapter selection, but that's unlikely to happen with a TV series.

602402,ALD1CRUBY1365,B00005JLMN,R. L. MILLER,"[1, 1]","This miniseries comes from back in the days before all you had to do to call a movie a ""miniseries"" was to make it big enough that it had to run on two or more nights. It's the same logic as using the term ""box set"" for any audio CD that requires two discs. Okay--end of rant.Failing farmer Will Henry Lee (Wayne Rogers) decides to accept the job of Delano's first chief of police rather than dig himself further into debt with credit extensions banker Hugh Holmes (Charlton Heston) still would have approved. But Holmes in his other role of the town's most prominent citizen agrees with Will Henry on his career change--he's the one who suggests the new job to him to begin with and supports his candidacy. Holmes also serves as voice-over narrator at intervals during the film. One person who does not agree is Sheriff Skeeter Willis (Paul Sorvino), who feels that Will Henry is not tough enough to be a cop. One other citizen who shares that view is reclusive landowner Foxy Funderburke (Keith Carradine), who was the other candidate for the job and didn't get chosen. Funderburke serves as the clich&eacute; ""mad hermit"" of the story. The story runs through an epic five decades, with other stars such as Billy Dee Williams as the first black chief much later in the film, plus Victoria Tennant (who we know from her co-starring role in ""Winds Of War/ War and Remembrance"") as the beautiful and gutsy English ""war bride"" of Will Henry's son Billy.Now as for the lousy sound. According to a disclaimer slide at the beginning of this DVD version, the original film suffered a lot of damage to the soundtrack while in storage, so it can't be helped. I believe I still have VHS tapes of this miniseries I grabbed off the air which sound better. But we'll have to wait for whatever tech improvements clean that up if there is a later version of this. It really is only that bad at first and I got used to it within a few minutes.

602404,A2HOHGKNTZ9EU1,B00005JLMN,Steven R. Cooper,"[1, 1]","Although the storyline is very good and the big-name actors a plus, if you are a videophile you will want to avoid this particular DVD version. Although the audio is very good, the video leaves much to be desired. The image is slightly out of focus (the FBI warning is, however, very sharp); the color is off...too much red; and the contrast is weak, giving a slightly washed out appearance. Additionally the compression rate is too high, resulting in severe &#34;pixelation&#34; in action scenes and some scene changes. Even the frame rate was slightly off, causing intermittent frame freezing, which is odd because this was a made-for-TV feature. The VHS recordings I made 30 years ago of the original broadcast still have better video quality than this DVD (unfortunately, the audio on those tapes has deteriorated to very poor quality). I'm not a videophile, so I found the poor video quality somewhat less than distracting, just disappointing. If you want a high quality DVD version, you'll have to wait until someone does a professional transfer from the original masters, if ever. But, if you can overlook the poor video quality, it's an enjoyable movie. I would also mention that the original broadcast was in three parts, while this version was done as one part spread across two DVDs - I would have preferred the original 3-part presentation.",3,One of the worst video transfers I have seen.,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1352,"['storyline', 'very', 'good', 'big-name', 'actors', 'plus', 'are', 'videophile', 'will', 'want', 'avoid', 'particular', 'DVD', 'version', 'audio', 'very', 'good', 'video', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'image', 'slightly', 'focus', 'FBI', 'warning', 'however', 'very', 'sharp', 'color', 'too', 'much', 'red', 'contrast', 'weak', 'giving', 'slightly', 'washed', 'out', 'appearance', 'Additionally', 'compression', 'rate', 'too', 'high', 'resulting', 'severe', '34', 'pixelation', '34', 'action', 'scenes', 'scene', 'changes', 'Even', 'frame', 'rate', 'was', 'slightly', 'off', 'causing', 'intermittent', 'frame', 'freezing', 'odd', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'feature', 'VHS', 'recordings', 'made', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'original', 'broadcast', 'still', 'have', 'better', 'video', 'quality', 'DVD', 'unfortunately', 'audio', 'tapes', 'deteriorated', 'very', 'poor', 'quality', ""'m"", 'not', 'videophile', 'found', 'poor', 'video', 'quality', 'somewhat', 'less', 'distracting', 'just', 'disappointing', 'want', 'high', 'quality', 'DVD', 'version', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'someone', 'professional', 'transfer', 'original', 'masters', 'ever', 'can', 'overlook', 'poor', 'video', 'quality', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'would', 'also', 'mention', 'original', 'broadcast', 'was', 'three', 'parts', 'version', 'was', 'done', 'one', 'part', 'spread', 'two', 'DVDs', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'original', '3-part', 'presentation']",N/A
