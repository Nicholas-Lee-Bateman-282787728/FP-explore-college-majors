The only thing these dramatizations have in common with the original novels is the names of a few characters and a weak link with what happened.  The problem being that Christie was probably the best writer of coherent plots with no flaws and the script writer is not up to that standard.  The plots seem to be a jumble of activity that does not fit together.The characters are now lower class compared to the characters in the novels.  As an example, Bertram's hotel (which originally had only upper class customers) is now populated with lower class people wearing expensive clothes who are so socially unskilled that they cannot walk across a room without bumping into a few dozen other people.The only two good thing I can say about this set of dramatizations is that none of the actresses wear heavily padded bras as did the actresses in the first two sets.  In fact the few actress that are above average in fullness dresses to tone it down.  Also, there is no woman to woman romantic-physical affection as occurred in the first two sets.One of the program plots relies on a convent of Catholic nuns allowing a novice to wear secular jewelry.

1078761,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000R349JI,mirasreviews,"[22, 34]","""Agatha Christie's Marple"" has hit its stride in the third season. Labyrinthine plots and memorable characterizations offer more meaty melodrama than previous seasons. The series is no longer bland or cursory. And I am getting used to Geraldine McEwan's scruffy, irritating characterization of Miss Marple. Actually, Miss Marple is a co-investigator in ""At Bertram's Hotel"" and leaves most of the snooping to others in ""Ordeal by Innocence"", placing the substance of the films in the hands of fine supporting casts. ""Towards Zero"" and ""Ordeal by Innocence"" were not, in fact, Miss Marple books. The series seems to have found the right balance of histrionics and period ambiance for maximum entertainment value. I enjoyed this more than previous seasons, and I encourage anyone who didn't like the ""new"" Miss Marple to give Series 3 a try. These are the mysteries:""Towards Zero"" refers to the idea that the circumstances of murder develop over years and converge at a zero hour. In this case, Lady Camilla Tressilian's (Eileen Atkins) family converge on her estate for holiday. Among them are her tennis pro nephew Neville (Greg Wise), his first wife Audrey (Saffron Burrows), his current wife Kay (Zoe Tapper), Kay's playboy friend Teddy Latimer (Paul Nicholls), lawyer Freddy Treves (Tom Baker), and Miss Marple, who knew Lady Camilla in their school days. Mr. Treves tells a peculiar story one evening about a child who got away with murder by claiming the gruesome death of his brother was an accident. Treves suffers a fatal heart attack later that night. When Camilla is bludgeoned to death in her bed, it's clear that something wicked is afoot. The crotchety, overbearing Lady Tressilian lends this mystery some welcome bite.It's 1951 in ""Nemesis"", and Miss Marple's dear old friend, German expatriate Jason Rafiel, has died and left her a record imploring her to investigate ""a terrible crime"" along with 2 tickets to a coach tour for herself and a trusted companion. She asks her novelist nephew Raymond West (Richard E. Grant) to join her, and off they are on a Daffodil mystery tour, accompanied by energetic tour guide Georgina (Ruth Wilson) and 10 other people who also received invitations from an anonymous benefactor. As the tour progresses from the palatial estate Forrester Grange to a convent, it becomes apparent that the tour guests are all connected is some way to a young woman named Verity (Laura-Michelle Kelly) who disappeared 11 years before as she was about to elope with a German pilot during the War.Miss Marple finds that little ahs changed since her childhood ""At Bertram's Hotel"". She is there to see a friend, Selina (Francesca Annis), the third cousin of missing, presumed dead, tycoon Sir Richard Blake. Blake's adventuress wife Bess (Polly Walker) and their estranged daughter Elvira (Emily Beecham) have also come for the will reading. When a maid is found strangled on the hotel's roof, Inspector Bird (Stephen Mangan) of Scotland Yard investigates. Miss Marple enlists the help of enterprising maid Jane (Martine McCutcheon) to unravel the mystery of murder, threats on Bess' life, a snap-happy hat designer, a Eastern European race car driver, and artwork on the hotel's walls that looks surprisingly authentic. The humor and the stylized, almost whimsical atmosphere that permeates this mystery is a nice change of tone.In ""Ordeal by Innocence"", Miss Marple is delighted to be invited to the wedding of Gwenda Vaughn (Juliet Stevenson) to whom she had been a mentor when Gwenda was an orphaned young woman in service. Gwenda is engaged to Leo Argyle (Denis Lawson), a widowed writer for whom she worked as a secretary. Leo's domineering, wealthy wife Rachel (Jane Seymour) was murdered 2 years before, shortly after refusing to pay their son Jacko's (Burn Gorman) gambling debts. With both Rachel and Jacko, who was executed for the crime, out of the picture, the family found relative peace. Now Leo, Gwenda, the 4 remaining children, and Miss Marple cheerfully gather in anticipation of the wedding. But Dr. Calgary (Julian Rhind Tutt) interrupts their evening with shocking news: Jacko had an alibi for the time of his mother's murder.",4,This Marple Series Discovers Its Strengths in Season 3.,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,4180,"['Agatha', 'Christie', 'Marple', 'hit', 'stride', 'third', 'season', 'Labyrinthine', 'plots', 'memorable', 'characterizations', 'offer', 'more', 'meaty', 'melodrama', 'previous', 'seasons', 'series', 'longer', 'bland', 'cursory', 'am', 'getting', 'used', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'scruffy', 'irritating', 'characterization', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Actually', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'co-investigator', 'Bertram', 'Hotel', 'most', 'snooping', 'others', 'Ordeal', 'Innocence', 'placing', 'substance', 'films', 'hands', 'fine', 'supporting', 'casts', 'Towards', 'Zero', 'Ordeal', 'Innocence', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'books', 'series', 'have', 'found', 'right', 'balance', 'histrionics', 'period', 'ambiance', 'maximum', 'entertainment', 'value', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'previous', 'seasons', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'new', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'give', 'Series', '3', 'try', 'are', 'mysteries', 'Towards', 'Zero', 'refers', 'idea', 'circumstances', 'murder', 'develop', 'years', 'converge', 'zero', 'hour', 'case', 'Lady', 'Camilla', 'Tressilian', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'family', 'converge', 'estate', 'holiday', 'are', 'tennis', 'pro', 'nephew', 'Neville', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'first', 'wife', 'Audrey', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'current', 'wife', 'Kay', 'Zoe', 'Tapper', 'Kay', 'playboy', 'friend', 'Teddy', 'Latimer', 'Paul', 'Nicholls', 'lawyer', 'Freddy', 'Treves', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'who', 'knew', 'Lady', 'Camilla', 'school', 'days', 'Mr.', 'Treves', 'peculiar', 'story', 'one', 'evening', 'child', 'who', 'got', 'away', 'murder', 'claiming', 'gruesome', 'death', 'brother', 'was', 'accident', 'suffers', 'fatal', 'heart', 'attack', 'later', 'night', 'When', 'Camilla', 'bludgeoned', 'death', 'bed', 'clear', 'something', 'wicked', 'afoot', 'crotchety', 'overbearing', 'Lady', 'Tressilian', 'mystery', 'welcome', 'bite.It', '1951', 'Nemesis', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'dear', 'old', 'friend', 'German', 'expatriate', 'Jason', 'Rafiel', 'died', 'left', 'record', 'imploring', 'investigate', 'terrible', 'crime', '2', 'tickets', 'coach', 'tour', 'herself', 'trusted', 'companion', 'novelist', 'nephew', 'Raymond', 'West', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'join', 'are', 'Daffodil', 'mystery', 'tour', 'accompanied', 'energetic', 'tour', 'guide', 'Georgina', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', '10', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'also', 'received', 'invitations', 'anonymous', 'benefactor', 'tour', 'palatial', 'estate', 'Forrester', 'Grange', 'convent', 'apparent', 'tour', 'guests', 'are', 'connected', 'way', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Verity', 'Laura-Michelle', 'Kelly', 'who', 'disappeared', '11', 'years', 'was', 'about', 'elope', 'German', 'pilot', 'War.Miss', 'Marple', 'little', 'ahs', 'changed', 'childhood', 'Bertram', 'Hotel', 'there', 'see', 'friend', 'Selina', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'third', 'cousin', 'missing', 'presumed', 'dead', 'tycoon', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'Blake', 'Blake', 'adventuress', 'wife', 'Bess', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Elvira', 'Emily', 'Beecham', 'have', 'also', 'come', 'will', 'reading', 'When', 'maid', 'found', 'strangled', 'hotel', 'roof', 'Inspector', 'Bird', 'Stephen', 'Mangan', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'help', 'enterprising', 'maid', 'Jane', 'Martine', 'McCutcheon', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'murder', 'threats', 'Bess', 'life', 'snap-happy', 'hat', 'designer', 'Eastern', 'European', 'race', 'car', 'driver', 'artwork', 'hotel', 'walls', 'surprisingly', 'authentic', 'humor', 'stylized', 'almost', 'whimsical', 'atmosphere', 'mystery', 'nice', 'change', 'tone.In', 'Ordeal', 'Innocence', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'delighted', 'be', 'invited', 'wedding', 'Gwenda', 'Vaughn', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'whom', 'had', 'been', 'mentor', 'when', 'Gwenda', 'was', 'orphaned', 'young', 'woman', 'service', 'Gwenda', 'engaged', 'Leo', 'Argyle', 'Denis', 'Lawson', 'widowed', 'writer', 'whom', 'worked', 'secretary', 'Leo', 'domineering', 'wealthy', 'wife', 'Rachel', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'was', 'murdered', '2', 'years', 'before', 'shortly', 'refusing', 'pay', 'son', 'Jacko', 'Burn', 'Gorman', 'gambling', 'debts', 'Rachel', 'Jacko', 'who', 'was', 'executed', 'crime', 'picture', 'family', 'found', 'relative', 'peace', 'Now', 'Leo', 'Gwenda', '4', 'remaining', 'children', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'cheerfully', 'gather', 'anticipation', 'wedding', 'Dr.', 'Calgary', 'Julian', 'Rhind', 'Tutt', 'interrupts', 'evening', 'shocking', 'news', 'Jacko', 'had', 'alibi', 'time', 'mother', 'murder']",Agatha Christie's Marple Series 3

1078769,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,B000R349JI,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[4, 8]","Geraldine McEwan IS the definitive Miss Marple -- AGATHA CHRISTIE'S vision of Miss Marple. She's not necessarily the ""best"" Miss Marple we've ever seen. I believe that this award must go to Margaret Rutherford in this series:The Agatha Christie Miss Marple Movie Collection (Murder at the Gallop / Murder Ahoy / Murder Most Foul / Murder She Said)Of course, Margaret Rutherford was nothing like the Marple of whom Christie wrote so fondly -- but her performance in those four excellent and timeless black-and-white films was nothing short of superb.But we cannot allow mediocre screenwriting to take away from Geraldine McEwan's fine performance in this series. While her acting was brilliant, the films had an '80s feel about them and many of the various scenes seemed contrived. Yes, these are cozy murders so we expect a little tongue-and-cheekness but I think that better direction could have yielded an outstanding product. The star talent was clearly available.I am commenting on 3 of the 4 of this series that I've seen so far, including ""Nemesis,"" ""Towards Zero,"" and, ""At Bertram's Hotel,"" (but not""Ordeal by Innocence,"" which I have yet to view). By the way, there is an incredible Donald Sutherland ""noir-version"" of ""Ordeal by Innocence"" if you have yet to hear of it:Ordeal by Innocence ([...] Exclusive)""Nemesis"" is sort of jumbled and over-dramatized, story-wise. It's all about Miss Marple solving an old murder (and a new one) during a bus tour of the English countryside. As a consequence of this, you can expect some spectacular cinematography which saves the film.In ""Towards Zero,"" the story gains coherence as it goes along but it lacks substance. It's as if the actors were ""puting out product"". I think that the Director must have kept them on too tight a leash. I was THRILLED to get to see a much aged, but still great, Tom Baker (of ""Doctor Who"" fame!) playing the victim in this one.""At Bertram's Hotel"" is a huge stretch from Christie's superb original story. If that's what you're expecting you'll be disappointed because the producers fleshed out about 60 percent of it. Consequentially, the screenplay is limited to murder at (near) the hotel and that's about it. Most of the original international intrigue and swarthy characters have been nullified. Again, it's okay, but it could have been outstanding.I wondered after watching these films why the producers and casting directors went to all the effort to grab the perfect Miss Marple and then, with barrels of red ink and abounding artistic license, ditzed the original Christie stories. It's a puzzle to me.The quality of these DVDs is excellent and the scenes are well-done in terms of costumes and set artifacts. If you're a big Christie fan, definitely watch these. If you're a broader-market cozy murder fan, you can still watch with interest. More casual movie enthusiasts will probably yawn quite a bit during viewings of these films.",4,The best Miss Marple -- the writing is a little tedious,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,2927,"['Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'definitive', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'AGATHA', 'CHRISTIE', 'vision', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'not', 'necessarily', 'best', 'Miss', 'Marple', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'believe', 'award', 'must', 'go', 'Margaret', 'Rutherford', 'series', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Movie', 'Collection', 'Murder', 'Gallop', '/', 'Murder', 'Ahoy', '/', 'Murder', 'Most', 'Foul', '/', 'Murder', 'Said', 'course', 'Margaret', 'Rutherford', 'was', 'nothing', 'Marple', 'whom', 'Christie', 'wrote', 'so', 'fondly', 'performance', 'four', 'excellent', 'timeless', 'black-and-white', 'films', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'superb.But', 'can', 'not', 'allow', 'mediocre', 'screenwriting', 'take', 'away', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'fine', 'performance', 'series', 'acting', 'was', 'brilliant', 'films', 'had', ""'80s"", 'feel', 'many', 'various', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'contrived', 'Yes', 'are', 'cozy', 'murders', 'expect', 'little', 'tongue-and-cheekness', 'think', 'better', 'direction', 'could', 'have', 'yielded', 'outstanding', 'product', 'star', 'talent', 'was', 'clearly', 'available.I', 'am', 'commenting', '3', '4', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'including', 'Nemesis', 'Towards', 'Zero', 'Bertram', 'Hotel', 'not', 'Ordeal', 'Innocence', 'have', 'yet', 'view', 'way', 'incredible', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'noir-version', 'Ordeal', 'Innocence', 'have', 'yet', 'hear', 'Ordeal', 'Innocence', '[', ']', 'Exclusive', 'Nemesis', 'sort', 'jumbled', 'over-dramatized', 'story-wise', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'solving', 'old', 'murder', 'new', 'one', 'bus', 'tour', 'English', 'countryside', 'consequence', 'can', 'expect', 'spectacular', 'cinematography', 'film.In', 'Towards', 'Zero', 'story', 'gains', 'coherence', 'along', 'substance', 'actors', 'were', 'puting', 'out', 'product', 'think', 'Director', 'must', 'have', 'kept', 'too', 'tight', 'leash', 'was', 'THRILLED', 'get', 'see', 'much', 'aged', 'still', 'great', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fame', 'playing', 'victim', 'one', 'Bertram', 'Hotel', 'huge', 'stretch', 'Christie', 'superb', 'original', 'story', 'what', ""'re"", 'expecting', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'producers', 'fleshed', 'out', '60', 'percent', 'Consequentially', 'screenplay', 'limited', 'murder', 'hotel', 'Most', 'original', 'international', 'intrigue', 'swarthy', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'nullified', 'Again', 'okay', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'outstanding.I', 'wondered', 'watching', 'films', 'why', 'producers', 'casting', 'directors', 'went', 'effort', 'grab', 'perfect', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'then', 'barrels', 'red', 'ink', 'abounding', 'artistic', 'license', 'ditzed', 'original', 'Christie', 'stories', 'puzzle', 'me.The', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'are', 'well-done', 'terms', 'costumes', 'set', 'artifacts', ""'re"", 'big', 'Christie', 'fan', 'definitely', ""'re"", 'broader-market', 'cozy', 'murder', 'fan', 'can', 'still', 'watch', 'interest', 'More', 'casual', 'movie', 'enthusiasts', 'will', 'probably', 'yawn', 'quite', 'bit', 'viewings', 'films']",Agatha Christie's Marple Series 3
1078770,A1BFPW6FP0DPNF,B000R349JI,Petite Fleur,"[29, 37]","Call me a ""Purist,"" if you want, but this series doesn't even come close to Agatha Christie's wonderful spinster sleuth.  Christie's intricate plots, complicated and multi-dimensional characters, red herrings and surprising endings have all been changed.  With this ""New"" series we have foolish and unintentionally comical scripts, shallow characters, and some of the silliest plot twists since Peter Sellers did the Pink Panther.  There's very little of Christie's books here except for the titles, the names of a few characters and Miss Marple of course.  Everything else has been changed to suit a newer market, whatever that may be.  My biggest criticism is for Bertram's Hotel, where Miss Marple is literally sidelined for the Hotel Maid.  Yes, the creators have made Miss Marple so dithering, twittering, twinkling and feeble that the Hotel Maid has to do the sleuthing and summing up of the crime.  Agatha Christie would turn in her grave!!BERTRAM'S HOTEL:  The creators of this series changed Bertram's Hotel from the classy and Edwardian style hotel with older clientele and elaborate teas to a loud and garish three-ring circus.  It opens with Miss Marple walking in and looking like a homeless waif.  There's a group of screaming young twits running to see....are you ready for this???.....Louie Armstrong!!! Bess Sedgwick has been changed from a classy, thrill-seeker and absentee mother to a dumpy, depressed looking drudge.  She's also been made a secondary character.  Of Course in keeping with the inane changes of Christie's writing, there's a Nazi spin just to keep things repetitive and boring.  There's also one of the silliest and unbelievable shootouts in the streets of London no less.  Cartoonish characters of a hat designer who looks like a 1700's style French clown and a loud Jazz Singer have just been thrown in to be the new red herrings.  This is the worst of the lot, strictly because they push Miss Marple to the sidelines.  Geraldine McEwan doesn't have a chance to show her real acting abilities.  Miss Marple is the real victim here.  Bumped off by an annoying Hotel Maid.NEMESIS:  Again more incomprehensible plot and character changes make Christie's real ""Nemesis"" unrecognizable from this mess.  Too bad some of us actually know what great plots Christie wrote because they don't exist here.  More recognizable actors have been placed in each episode to make us forget that the real plot doesn't exist.  Richard Grant is wasted and given the inenviable role of a foolish womanizer.  Again with the German Nazi plot twist added where it never existed in Christie's plot.  The three sisters who are essential to the plot have been changed to Nuns in the Catholic Church.  The ending is comical.  Too bad Peter Sellers is dead.  He would be great in this one.TOWARDS ZERO and ORDEAL BY INNOCENCE:  Miss marple never appeared in Christie's wonderful mysteries by these titles, but since when has that stopped this untalented crew?  They just plopped her in anywhere.  That's okay since there's no plotting or characters of note.  Just a lot of scenery chewing by more recognizable actors.  Since I've seen most of them in other British productions I know they're worthy of better acting.  Unfortunately not here because their main function is to do a lot of eye popping.  Jane Seymour and Greg Wise literally do that.  It's a waste of their talent.These productions remind me of little community plays put on by amatuers.  They're loud, garish and sadly lacking in any quality.  For those of us who know and love AGATHA CHRISTIE'S real Miss Marple this is a major diappointment indeed.If you want to enjoy this series, don't open an Agatha Christie book.

No one on the production staff seemed the least bit concerned with historical or literary accuracy. It makes you sigh for what could have been.Also ironic is the appearance of perhaps an anti-clergy slant, since Miss Marple was the daughter of an Anglican vicar. Earlier we saw at least one  alcoholic rector, and now we have presented to us a), a society matron in the book Nemesis changed into a murderously obsessed nun for television; and b), a character changed from the kind, gentle Canon Pennyfather in the novel of At Bertram's Hotel to a crazed Nazi war criminal masquerading as an Anglican priest.Nor is the QUIET, efficiently run establishment of understated elegance in the novel anywhere to be seen; it is a place of utter chaos invaded by an American jazz band (which Miss Marple seems to relish; she's almost snapping her finger to the beat--""Yeah man""). Yikes! By changing and inventing all the characters for the TV series while keeping some basic thread of the original plot, the viewer gets the worst of both worlds: Everything but the ending is now a surprise.Which brings us to the most hilarious bit of all: In Bertram's Hotel, when Miss Marple asks Jane, the chambermaid, if she and the chief inspector are going to get married after discovering romance, the young woman says, ""Oh no, we're just going to live together; that's how it's done these days"" (remember, this is 1952); and even more roll-on-the-floor funny is Miss Marple's reply: ""That's not what I would have done at your age, but I probably would now.""Oh yes. Little ladylike Miss Marple shacking up with the (not even very handsome) chief inspector. Good lord--where will the scriptwriters go from there?

I'm no worshipper of the old Hickson series and would have been happy to see new versions, but these new ones are just dumbed-down and insulting to Christie.  Some of the newer Poirots have been quite good, but even with sexing up most of them have remained sufficiently true to the text (a major exception being the egregious Cards on the Table adaptation).  The Marples, on the other hand, have just been one disaster after another, beginning with the ongoing destruction of Miss Marple's character.  Whoever the woman is in these films she is not Miss Marple.  Christie's grandson should be ashamed of himself for allowing this to continue.  But, that aside, the adaptations just aren't very good.  Nemesis and Bertram's Hotel are by no means perfect books, but the changes in the films make them look idiotic.  They just seem to be doing changes for the sake of making changes at this point.
