I had stayed up late to watch the weekly feature on the local station's weekly Western. And there it was, MAN IN THE WILDERNESS, a tale about a mountain man who is left for dead after a brutal grizzly mauling and not only lives to carry on but finds his real life in the process.First, throw away any misconceptions that this is a historical account. Yes, there are fictionalizations of historical characters. Zach Bass, himself, is loosely based on Hugh Glass. But who cares? The drama here, the sweeping panoramas, the gritty cinematography combine to offer a movie experience the likes of which are just not available anymore.Richard Harris stars as Zach Bass, a stowaway who became a mountain man, thrust into the West during the 1820's. His mentor, Captain Henry, played masterfully by the inimitable John Huston--one of Hollywood's greatest legends--a man demonized by his past on the sea while being locked within mountains and valleys and pursued by Indians. After leaving Bass for dead, his crazed mind adds Bass's specter to his tormenters.In the end, this one is a classic tale of obsession, of survival, of priorities and of forgiveness, all set in the rugged grandeur of the frontier. An absolute Western classic.And, as this DVD is a double feature, forget about the flipside of this one and stick with MAN IN THE WILDERNESS.THE HORSEMAN",5,AN ABSOLUTE WESTERN CLASSIC,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,1409,"['recall', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'MAN', 'IN', 'THE', 'WILDERNESS', 'had', 'stayed', 'up', 'late', 'watch', 'weekly', 'feature', 'local', 'station', 'weekly', 'Western', 'was', 'MAN', 'IN', 'THE', 'WILDERNESS', 'tale', 'mountain', 'man', 'who', 'left', 'dead', 'brutal', 'grizzly', 'mauling', 'not', 'only', 'carry', 'real', 'life', 'process.First', 'throw', 'away', 'misconceptions', 'historical', 'account', 'Yes', 'are', 'fictionalizations', 'historical', 'characters', 'Zach', 'Bass', 'loosely', 'based', 'Hugh', 'Glass', 'who', 'drama', 'here', 'sweeping', 'panoramas', 'gritty', 'cinematography', 'combine', 'offer', 'movie', 'experience', 'likes', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'available', 'anymore.Richard', 'Harris', 'stars', 'Zach', 'Bass', 'stowaway', 'who', 'became', 'mountain', 'man', 'thrust', 'West', '1820', 'mentor', 'Captain', 'Henry', 'played', 'masterfully', 'inimitable', 'John', 'Huston', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'legends', 'man', 'demonized', 'past', 'sea', 'being', 'locked', 'mountains', 'valleys', 'pursued', 'Indians', 'leaving', 'Bass', 'dead', 'crazed', 'mind', 'Bass', 'specter', 'tormenters.In', 'end', 'one', 'classic', 'tale', 'obsession', 'survival', 'priorities', 'forgiveness', 'set', 'rugged', 'grandeur', 'frontier', 'absolute', 'Western', 'classic.And', 'DVD', 'double', 'feature', 'forget', 'flipside', 'one', 'stick', 'MAN', 'IN', 'THE', 'WILDERNESS.THE', 'HORSEMAN']",The Deadly Trackers / Man In The Wilderness

I bought this double feature disc purely because it has Man in The Wilderness as the second feature. This film has tremendous sentimental value for me because it was the first film my father took me to see when I was 5 or 6, something he rarely did.It is a great film if you enjoy seeing an individual pitted against whatever nature can throw at him, with nothing but his wits to see him through. I love that the film tells and shows so much with so little actual dialogue. I also really love the musical score. A very memorable main theme (""Zach's Theme""). Many others here have given the specifics behind the film - the true story which inspired it, as well as the plot details, etc., etc.Bottom line: if you enjoy minimalist storytelling that requires you to actually pay attention and work some plot details out for yourself then you'll enjoy this.  However, if you have a short attention span and your enjoyment of a movie is directly related to how much stuff gets blown up or how many naked breasts are bounced across the screen then steer clear, this film isn't for you.

1140146,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B00132D7Y0,Israel Drazin,"[3, 6]","In the Deadly Trackers, a grade B western, a well-meaning sheriff believes that using guns against criminals and shooting them to stop them is counter-productive; it provokes revenge, retaliation, and more deaths. Four killers come to town and rob the bank. The sheriff, who had confiscated the town's guns, gives out the weapons, but tells the citizens not to shoot. Since the criminals were not stopped, they have time to kill his wife and child. The sheriff's personality changes and he chases after the killers alone into Mexico. He meets a Mexican sheriff with a similar attitude that he had before the death of his wife and child. The Mexican tries to stop him from taking revenge and killing the criminals, saying that they should be caught and tried as required by law.The Mexican sheriff is also after the killers for what they did in Mexico, but, unlike the American sheriff, he has no intention of shooting them on sight. Thus, the two cannot join together in the search. The Mexican sheriff is able to capture one of the killers and does not kill him. While his deputy is taking the killer to prison the criminal kills the deputy. The American sheriff turns into a wild man. He shoots the criminals who killed his wife and child when he sees them. The movie has a surprising ending.The film raises a serious issue: Should lawmen be idealistic and do all in their power not to harm criminals? Should they consider that such an approach may lead to people being hurt? The issue also exists in regard to sexual perverts. Science has shown that they cannot be cured.

Instead this movie was a cutting edge realistic movie of its time that has gone unrecognized for its greatness. Bits and pieces of this movie could be used in a documentary about the real early pioneers of the west. The detail is amazing.  The story I understand is fictional but amazing non the less.What I like about the movie most of all is that it has a Christian base. Catholics as well as Protestants will understand this movie from this angle.From a Christian perspective the movie is about a man who was brought up in a mixed Christian world. His teachers were cruel and forced God on him without a sense of God's love. He lost his parents at an early age and was forced to live a hard life with men who probably did not know God's love.He was reintroduced to God by his good wife who was so filled with Faith, Hope, and Love.When he was left to die in the wilderness after being mauled by a bear, his hard upbringing wanted revenge. As he recovered from his near death injuries he reflected back on his religious upbringing and his good wife. He read the bible in his lonely nights and he began to realize more and more that he did not want revenge but only to just go back home. When he caught up with the men who left him to die, he forgave them without words and just went home. No shoot em up hollywood corn ball ending, but a great and realistic and very powerful ending.What a great movie it has something for everyone.

In this movie, he says barely a word, which helps the movie tremendously. It's a survival/adventure, believable, and has a mature and interesting story line.  I particularly like the non-traditional characterizations and anti-stereotyping. They're no clear-cut good guys and bad guys, white and black hats.

Historical inaccuracies aside, this is a story about a man who is left for dead in the northwest territory, but...more than that, it is the story of man lost inside himself. In his fight to survive he learns a little more about the hard cruel world around him and comes to appreciate that he is not the only human being to have suffered. His near death experience becomes (in the end) a sort of rebirth...a renwal of spirit and hope which, until the mauling, was a complete mystery to him. The images and music in this production have always touched and impressed me. It is not typical of the usual formulaic bilge Hollywood cranks out...and for that you will be grateful. This is a motion picture well worth your time and money. The actors do a fine job in all their portrayals and it is fun to see James Doohan, John Huston and Percy Herbert in their supporting rolls. For me this is one of Richard Harris's finest performances...better even than ""A MAN CALLED HORSE"". Richard Sarafian (the director of credit) had a small part in the Wachowski Brothers ""BOUND"" (1996) as a mob boss.As for the DVD quality, it looks fine considering the time the movie was made and the no frills approach to this release. The print is far better than that of the VHS and is finally shown in the proper aspect ratio. The sound is monoural and the dialog a tad shrill in parts, but that is how I remember it...even in the theatrical release, which I went to see many times.As for ""THE DEADLY TRACKERS""...it is generally a waste of time. It is a sloppily made and heavy handed film of vengence that yields little (if any) satisfaction by story's end.Whatever you pay for this release will be money well spent for ""MAN IN THE WILDERNESS"" alone. *** ENJOY ***",5,IS IT BASS?
