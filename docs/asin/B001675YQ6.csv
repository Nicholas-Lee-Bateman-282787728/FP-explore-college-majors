Like the title says it totally takes a while to get moving, but once it does it gets hectic and you really start feeling for the characters. Acting-wise, things weren't bad, but I wasn't blown away either. Brittany stole the show as my favorite because she was quite charming a lot of the time with her dialogue but could be serious when called for too (R.I.P.). However, I could actually relate to Matthew Rhys' character's withdrawn-from-reality state of mind. His view and approach to relationships hit too close to home. I was rooting for him the whole time since he was the main underdog.All in all, I'm totally glad I used up an hour and a half of my life to watch this crazy movie. It was kinda dark, but not completely. I won't really give anything away because I want you to form your own opinions.

Even if you find it hard to embrace this movie, you will find it even harder to dislike it.At the risk of being controversial, I will rate this movie above multi-threaded ensemble movies like ""Love Actually"", ""Crash"", ""Valentine's Day"" and ""New York, I Love You"".  The surprise is in a singular actress carrying the entire movie, supported by a cast of relatively unknown but competent actors.As I am writing this review, James Taylor is coming on ""live"" at the Oscar presentation (this is Oscar night, 7th March in the USA) with Brittany Murphy being remembered on screeen, and her image reprised at the end of Taylor's solo ""In My Life"".  We will never know if she would earn an Oscar one day, but from her performance in this movie, it is not possible to rule out her future potential.  I have watched ""Ramen Girl"", ""Uptown Girls"" and the Futurama with Brittany's voice, and I went on a binge of Brittany Murphy's movies like ""Little Black Book"" after I got the news that no more movies would be made by this great actress.  This movie was among the prominent ones recommended by Amazon when keying in the actress' name.  The movie surprises at many levels.From earlier reviews I gathered that the plot was going to less straightforward than ""Ramen Girl"" or ""Uptown Girls"".  Without going into the story line, I like this movie because:1.  The acting was serious, focused and well directed.  I cannot think of another actress who could have been better cast in the main role.  The British accents all round were from good character thespians.2.  The cinematography was good.  There were refreshing camera angles of contemporary London.  The Houses of Parliament framed by the London Eye (across the river) was one such unexpected view.3.  The colours were bright.  Like on picture post-cards.  The indoor shots were unusually bright and colourful.  No dim ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" artwork requiring Night Vision Goggles here.  Brittany Murphy's fully nude body in a kitchen scene(strategically covered by a copy of ""The Naked Chef"") was boldly illuminated.  Refreshing to see the details of English interior furnishing instead of the usual American home interiors.4.  For an adult movie, there was relatively little swearing.  Then there is a sensible plot. It is fun, but does not sit well as a chick-flick.  Nobody picks up a movie like this to feel depressed at the end.  Best watched together with close friend(s): beer/alcohol optional, not a necessity.  For morbid, pick up ""Deadline"" or ""Dead Girl"".Brittany Murphy does a good ""damsel in distress"" with pleading doe-like eyes, as in ""Ramen Girl"".  This appears be a recurring pattern in her movies.  Well, if you are good at something, keep doing it -  Denzel Washington does a good ""Don't lie to me"", Tom Hanks replayed ""stupid"" in ""You've Got Mail"" and Julia Roberts does a good petulant temper tantrum in ""Pretty Woman"", ""Pelican Brief"", ""Erin Brockovich"" and so on.  I thought that Brittany's waif-like begging was similarly getting to be one of her acting trade-marks.I am glad to have experienced this movie.",5,Difficult to dislike,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,3170,"['taste', 'good', 'movies', 'will', 'like', 'least', 'parts', 'not', 'movie', 'Even', 'find', 'hard', 'embrace', 'movie', 'will', 'find', 'even', 'harder', 'dislike', 'it.At', 'risk', 'being', 'controversial', 'will', 'rate', 'movie', 'multi-threaded', 'ensemble', 'movies', 'Love', 'Actually', 'Crash', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'New', 'York', 'Love', 'surprise', 'singular', 'actress', 'carrying', 'entire', 'movie', 'supported', 'cast', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'competent', 'actors.As', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'James', 'Taylor', 'coming', 'live', 'Oscar', 'presentation', 'Oscar', 'night', '7th', 'March', 'USA', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'being', 'remembered', 'screeen', 'image', 'reprised', 'end', 'Taylor', 'solo', 'My', 'Life', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'would', 'earn', 'Oscar', 'one', 'day', 'performance', 'movie', 'not', 'possible', 'rule', 'out', 'future', 'potential', 'have', 'watched', 'Ramen', 'Girl', 'Uptown', 'Girls', 'Futurama', 'Brittany', 'voice', 'went', 'binge', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'movies', 'Little', 'Black', 'Book', 'got', 'news', 'more', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'great', 'actress', 'movie', 'was', 'prominent', 'ones', 'recommended', 'Amazon', 'when', 'keying', 'actress', 'name', 'movie', 'surprises', 'many', 'levels.From', 'earlier', 'reviews', 'gathered', 'plot', 'was', 'going', 'less', 'straightforward', 'Ramen', 'Girl', 'Uptown', 'Girls', 'going', 'story', 'line', 'like', 'movie', 'because:1', 'acting', 'was', 'serious', 'focused', 'well', 'directed', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'cast', 'main', 'role', 'British', 'accents', 'round', 'were', 'good', 'character', 'thespians.2', 'cinematography', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'refreshing', 'camera', 'angles', 'contemporary', 'London', 'Houses', 'Parliament', 'framed', 'London', 'Eye', 'river', 'was', 'one', 'such', 'unexpected', 'view.3', 'colours', 'were', 'bright', 'picture', 'post-cards', 'indoor', 'shots', 'were', 'unusually', 'bright', 'colourful', 'dim', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'artwork', 'requiring', 'Night', 'Vision', 'Goggles', 'here', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'fully', 'nude', 'body', 'kitchen', 'scene', 'strategically', 'covered', 'copy', 'Naked', 'Chef', 'was', 'boldly', 'illuminated', 'Refreshing', 'see', 'details', 'English', 'interior', 'furnishing', 'instead', 'usual', 'American', 'home', 'interiors.4', 'adult', 'movie', 'was', 'relatively', 'little', 'swearing', 'Then', 'sensible', 'plot', 'fun', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'chick-flick', 'Nobody', 'up', 'movie', 'feel', 'depressed', 'end', 'Best', 'watched', 'together', 'close', 'friend', 's', 'beer/alcohol', 'optional', 'not', 'necessity', 'morbid', 'pick', 'up', 'Deadline', 'Dead', 'Girl', '.Brittany', 'Murphy', 'good', 'damsel', 'distress', 'pleading', 'doe-like', 'eyes', 'Ramen', 'Girl', 'be', 'recurring', 'pattern', 'movies', 'Well', 'are', 'good', 'something', 'keep', 'doing', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'good', 'Do', ""n't"", 'lie', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'replayed', 'stupid', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'good', 'petulant', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Pelican', 'Brief', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'so', 'thought', 'Brittany', 'waif-like', 'begging', 'was', 'similarly', 'getting', 'be', 'one', 'acting', 'trade-marks.I', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'experienced', 'movie']",Love and Other Disasters

There is not one original idea in the script and just about every movie cliche to be found in romantic comedies is in this movie to wit:-- Murphy is a fashion designer with a mixed up love life.-- She befriends a gay photographer (who is actually not gay) that loves her.-- There are several other gay male characters in the film with mixed up love lives.-- In fact, all the characters in the film have a mixed up love life.-- All the actors are employed in the arts -- once writes a screeplay called ""Love and Other Disasters.""-- The film appears to be heading to tragedy but has a wonderful, happy ending.-- The movie ends by having the action in the film made into a movie.Having made these disclosures, I will say I adore this movie. This is such a warm film, so full of good spirits and love, that it transcends all these cliches to be not only good entertainment but a memorable film experience. The chemistry between Jacks (Murphy) and Paolo (Santiago Cabrera) is natural, unforced and credible. Almost all the actors are likeable, you root for them, and you want their love to succeed. And it does.I can't think of a romantic comedy I've seen in recent years that I enjoy as much as this 2006 production. It's better than ""Four Weddings And A Funeral""Four Weddings and a Funeralto which I think it compares very well. This is a sexy, delightful, easy on the eye and mind film that breezes through its 100 minutes and leaves you satisfied. If you're in the mood for mindless entertainment with a big warmth factor, this movie is for you.",4,Brittany Murphy 1977-2009,1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,1930,"['was', 'such', 'shame', 'when', 'young', 'vivacious', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'died', 'December', '2009', 'age', '32', 'depriving', 'film', 'world', 'sunny', 'countenance', 'biopic', 'rapper', 'Eminem', '8', 'Mile', '8', 'Mile', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'was', 'favorite', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'film.A', 'few', 'words', 'disclosure', 'are', 'necessary', 'film', 'Love', 'Other', 'Disasters', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'set', 'London', 'not', 'one', 'original', 'idea', 'script', 'just', 'movie', 'cliche', 'be', 'found', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'movie', 'wit', 'Murphy', 'fashion', 'designer', 'mixed', 'up', 'love', 'life.', 'gay', 'photographer', 'who', 'actually', 'not', 'gay', 'her.', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'gay', 'male', 'characters', 'film', 'mixed', 'up', 'love', 'lives.', 'fact', 'characters', 'film', 'have', 'mixed', 'up', 'love', 'life.', 'actors', 'are', 'employed', 'arts', 'once', 'screeplay', 'called', 'Love', 'Other', 'Disasters', 'film', 'be', 'heading', 'tragedy', 'wonderful', 'happy', 'ending.', 'movie', 'having', 'action', 'film', 'made', 'movie.Having', 'made', 'disclosures', 'will', 'say', 'adore', 'movie', 'such', 'warm', 'film', 'full', 'good', 'spirits', 'love', 'cliches', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'entertainment', 'memorable', 'film', 'experience', 'chemistry', 'Jacks', 'Murphy', 'Paolo', 'Santiago', 'Cabrera', 'natural', 'unforced', 'credible', 'Almost', 'actors', 'are', 'likeable', 'root', 'want', 'love', 'succeed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', '2006', 'production', 'better', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeralto', 'think', 'very', 'well', 'sexy', 'delightful', 'easy', 'eye', 'mind', 'film', '100', 'minutes', 'satisfied', ""'re"", 'mood', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'big', 'warmth', 'factor', 'movie']",Love and Other Disasters

Chain smoking cigarettes does not eccentric make.I don't think it really counts as a spoiler to let people know that Gwyneth Paltrow and Orlando Bloom are on the screen for about 20 seconds.

Bathroom chats while one takes a shower and the other sits on the toilet are commonplace in this household and that same openness extends to discussions of their romantic and sexual relationships with the same or opposite sex.Jacks' usually accurate &#34;gaydar&#34; fails her when she meets photographer Paolo Sarmiento (Santiago Carbrera) and thus begins a complicated relationship between Paolo and Jacks in which Jacks attempts to set Paolo up with Peter without his knowledge and Paolo yearns for a relationship with Jacks while assuming that she's romantically involved with Peter.Add into this unusual love triangle an ex-boyfriend James (Elliot Cowen) whom Jacks is still sleeping with out of pity; Jacks' emotionally distraught friend Tallulah (Catherine Tate); an elusive David Williams (Will Keen) who Peter bumps into and declares the object of love at first sight even though the two have never actually met; and a host of other farcically odd characters and the stage is set for a romantic comedy unlike any other.On top of it all, James is struggling to write a screenplay that reflects his own reality, but is finding honesty hard to adhere to in the Hollywood business of movie making.Guest cameos include Gwyneth Paltrow and Orlando Bloom.
