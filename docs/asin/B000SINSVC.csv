Part I was as good or better than ANY other episode of the show (and I have the complete collection).  My sides were splitting the entire time, definitely 5+ stars.However, the final episode was a bit of a letdown, it was almost anticlimactic.  I think the writers and directors had peaked on the previous episode and just didn't have anything left to give.  It rather dragged, the humor, while bawdy, just wasn't very funny; I mean, you can take Owen's (literal) love of animals only so far before it just gets old.  Even Alice wasn't very funny in the final show, her fixation with hanging a fake beard on Geraldine for the wedding left me flat.  3 stars (barely).I'm really sad the show has run its course.  To me, it is probably the best show ever to come from the BBC and I will miss it.

When I heard about the finale, I knew I had to have it. Suffice it to say, I laughed my head off. The fine folks of Dibley are hilarious as ever, and the addition of the gorgeous Richard Armitage was some great icing for the cake. Did I mention he's really good-looking. The Vicar is distressed to learn that yet another Dibley cottage has been sold to a ""layabout Londoner"" who doesn't care for the village as anything more than a weekend retreat. Resolved to give him a piece of her mind, she ends up giving him her heart and hand as well. You know from the beginning that they'll make it down the aisle, but since this is Dibley, you know the road won't be smooth. Geraldine's road to wedded bliss is rocky but hilarious, and you'll enjoy traveling it with her.

Sweet Harry is smitten and pursues the Vicar through several hilarious misunderstandings to win her hand.  The second part centers around the wedding which is a ""loving hands at home"" sort-of-affair. When her bridesmaid Alice showed up dressed as the 10th Dr. Who, I knew I was not in US anymore. All's well that ends well and this ends quite wonderfully.Armitage has a rare chance to play comedy here.

This edgy, topical comedy, flush with strange characters, is why we fell in love with the show in the first place.Like most of rural Oxfordshire, Dibley is overrun with London weekenders who want a country house but feel no ties to the community. But when Geraldine goes to give one of them a piece of her mind, he turns out to be - gasp! - as gorgeous as Richard Armitage. Their whirlwind romance proves everything Geraldine hoped for, until she realizes it's hard to serve a relationship and a parish at the same time.As before, the show turns on the culture clash between refined but brassy Geraldine and her rustic parishioners. It also uses a healthy dose of its patented ""can a vicar really say that?"" humor and in-yer-face characterization. It uses everything we love about the series, and its pace never lags.
