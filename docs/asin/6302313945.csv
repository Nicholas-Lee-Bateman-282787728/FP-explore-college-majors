The story begins to tell their history. Their trip to San Francisco brings back memories. But something seems to be wrong, somehow. Dan gets a shock when a hotel manager wishes his absent wife well! Dan starts to ease back into his job. He tracks down an invoice, and finds it was for a private investigator! This PI mailed (?) the negatives just before the car accident. Dan's wife was having an affair with a ""Jack Stanton""; he has resigned and then disappeared. Dan follows his wife to a ship wreck on the site of a future development. When the PI contacts Dan, they follow Dan's wife to a hotel, then ""Jack Stanton"" leaves and they follow him to a road in the woods. Shots are fired, and they chase this car. Something is wrong!At night Dan sees the red car arrive at his home. Then he gets a shock after ""Jack Stanton"" enters his room. Dan gets details of what happened before the accident. His wife tells him they must pack and leave that night. But he gets a call from Jenny, who says she will call the police if he doesn't come over for a personal talk. Now the story becomes even more convoluted after Jenny is found dead. PI Gus Klein shows up to aid in the resolution to this story. But another surprise occurs to finish this story with a poetic ending.

Tom Berenger does well as a confused amnesiac who just wants to get to the truth behind his accident--even if it means he discovers things he doesn't really want to know. The ever-lovable Bob Hoskins plays the detective who helps him uncover the truth. Greta Scacchi is his loyal wife (with perhaps a few secrets?).This film is very engrossing and entertaining. Even though I usually can guess the way a mystery movie is going to go (I am getting pretty good at predicting &quot;who dunnit&quot;) this movie had a few more twists that I anticipated. I really enjoyed the surprises in the plot.There are some unanswered questions left unanswered, and more than a few plot holes. But still--don't let that keep you from enjoying the mystery.
