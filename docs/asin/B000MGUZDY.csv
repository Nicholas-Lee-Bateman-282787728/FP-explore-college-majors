1046619,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B000MGUZDY,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[1, 2]","""Here They Come (From Around The World),"" that's what Jan & Dean sang as THE T.A.M.I. SHOW DVD opens up showing the arrival of the many musical acts, including some getting ready backstage like the Supremes, that will take the stage for this concert. From that point on, you know you're in for a real treat. You can actually feel the excitement jumping off the screen.No wonder this is considered to be one of the ""greatest rock 'n' roll movies"" ever!Although I wasn't even born then, and the audience was mostly teenagers, this had to be the jumping off point for rock music and for pop culture itself. Most of the acts probably weren't that much older than the young audience itself and this was before egos and heartbreak entered into the scene. You'll get to witness truly talented musical acts who were in their prime, singing and dancing, and hopeful about the future.Not only will you get to see and hear superstar rockers like the Rolling Stones, The Supremes, The Miracles, Marvin Gaye (Darlene Love & The Blossoms doing back-up), The Beach Boys, Jan & Dean, Leslie Gore (who at the time was the biggest star on the ticket) and others, you also get to see the fabulous go-go dancers in the background, both male and female, dancing those crazy, swinging 60's dance moves. I really enjoyed the dancers and some even interact with the bands on stage.The picture itself is sharp and clean, and looks great. There's one issue that I have though and it's with some of the shots during the slower tempo songs. The camera uses some sort of filter on the lens so that the surrounding image is blurred. It's like looking through a doughnut hole with the image clear on the inside and blurry on the out, but fortunately that effect is kept to a minimum.At the end of the concert, all of the acts gather on stage to sing a song; the perfect ending to a brilliant movie/concert.=====  EXTRAS  =====* Commentary by Director Steve Binder and music historian Don Waller* 4-Radio Spots-Just audio and no ""play all"" feature.

1046621,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B000MGUZDY,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[3, 4]","I have a special reason for loving this film. I was born on Dec. 23, 1964 at the Bull Clinic Hospital in Spartanburg, SC. According to the local newspaper for that day, a few blocks away at that very moment, this film was showing at the Carolina Theater! I did not see this until I was 16 on USA Network's NIGHT FLIGHT (of sainted memory). So I am proud of this connection.Simply put, this is one of (if not THE) best rock concert film of all time! I like the fact that early in the proceedings, Jan and Dean (who MC and provide comic relief) introduce Chuck Berry as ""The man who started it all."" In a sense, you see the past (Chuck Berry), the present (The Motown Groups and the Beach Boys) and the future (James Brown and the Rolling Stones) of Rock and Soul as it stood in 1964.At that time, kids could see a multi-act rock & roll extravaganza like this for $2.50 or so, but surprisingly, this is one of the few live shows of its kind to be filmed when rock was young. Some highlights include the Miracles doing their ""Mickey's Monkey"" stage routine (this also appears in the 1965 British special ""The Sound of Motown""), the once-lost Beach Boys footage (amusing to see Mike Love do the Monkey dance), the Rolling Stones'conclusion (with Jagger attampting a spastic James Brown imitation) and best of all, the best surviving footage of James Brown (aside from the 1968 Boston show on DVD). His ""Please Please Please"" (complete with the cape) and NIGHT TRAIN (where either the  Supremes or the Blossoms send the Godfather back on stage from the wings to do an encore). The Godfather spins, screams, splits, and shimmies in a manner never seen by mainstream America up to that time and still enthralls today. However, Gerry of Gerry & The Pacemakers looks like he's in pain while trying to sing. Billy J. Kramer looks like quite a weak performer by modern standards (and like Andy Kaufman's long lost cousin) but his performance is actually so stiff and awkward that its unintentionally comical, particularly his attempts to dance at the end. Interestingly, the Supremes appear right before JB with an appealing performance of their early hits that is as tame and polished as the Godfather is wild and uninhibited (you can actually count 1-2-3-kick during Diana & co.'s routines)! Oh yeah, the go-go girls (including young Teri Garr) are quite fetching and it's a hoot at the end to see Chuck Berry slyly cheking out the cleavage of dancer Debbie Butler!So fans can throw away those cheap, unfocused, ahem..""unauthorized"" DVDs. Step right up and get the REAL THING about the foundation of Rock and Soul.ADDENDUM NOW THAT I HAVE THE...AHEM, ""AUTHORIZED"" DVD.The liner notes and bonus features are wonderful. They answer every question you may have had about this (who were the go go dancers, what was it like to be in the audience, what was happening backstage, how did this wonderful show come together, etc). However, the only performer I've heard form on this subject was Dean Torrence (of Jan and Dean)who discussed his experiences during the recent PBS showing of this special. John Landis, who was there with his Jr. high classmate David Cassidy (yes, THAT David Cassidy), shares his recollections over the commentary of the original trailer. Some color pictures are included in the liner notes. Director Steve Binder gives some wonderful detailed commentary over the backstory and backstage goings on, especially during the James Brown and Supremes footage. There are also some original radio commericals with what sounds like the ultimate 60s radio DJ stereotype (hi groovy guys and gals).... In short, just get it.",5,"Move over woodstock, Rock & Soul in its prime!",1267660800,"03 4, 2010",2010,3624,"['have', 'special', 'reason', 'loving', 'film', 'was', 'born', 'Dec.', '23', '1964', 'Bull', 'Clinic', 'Hospital', 'Spartanburg', 'SC', 'According', 'local', 'newspaper', 'day', 'few', 'blocks', 'away', 'very', 'moment', 'film', 'was', 'showing', 'Carolina', 'Theater', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'was', '16', 'USA', 'Network', 'NIGHT', 'FLIGHT', 'sainted', 'memory', 'am', 'proud', 'connection.Simply', 'put', 'one', 'not', 'THE', 'best', 'rock', 'concert', 'film', 'time', 'like', 'fact', 'early', 'proceedings', 'Jan', 'Dean', 'who', 'MC', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'introduce', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'man', 'who', 'started', 'sense', 'see', 'past', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'present', 'Motown', 'Groups', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'future', 'James', 'Brown', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Rock', 'Soul', 'stood', '1964.At', 'time', 'kids', 'could', 'see', 'multi-act', 'rock', 'roll', 'extravaganza', '2.50', 'so', 'surprisingly', 'one', 'few', 'live', 'shows', 'kind', 'be', 'filmed', 'when', 'rock', 'was', 'young', 'highlights', 'include', 'Miracles', 'doing', 'Mickey', 'Monkey', 'stage', 'routine', 'also', '1965', 'British', 'special', 'Sound', 'Motown', 'once-lost', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'footage', 'amusing', 'see', 'Mike', 'Love', 'do', 'Monkey', 'dance', 'Rolling', ""Stones'conclusion"", 'Jagger', 'attampting', 'spastic', 'James', 'Brown', 'imitation', 'best', 'best', 'surviving', 'footage', 'James', 'Brown', 'aside', '1968', 'Boston', 'show', 'DVD', 'Please', 'Please', 'Please', 'complete', 'cape', 'NIGHT', 'TRAIN', 'where', 'either', 'Supremes', 'Blossoms', 'send', 'Godfather', 'back', 'stage', 'wings', 'do', 'encore', 'Godfather', 'spins', 'screams', 'splits', 'shimmies', 'manner', 'never', 'seen', 'mainstream', 'America', 'up', 'time', 'still', 'enthralls', 'today', 'However', 'Gerry', 'Gerry', 'Pacemakers', 'pain', 'trying', 'sing', 'Billy', 'J.', 'Kramer', 'quite', 'weak', 'performer', 'modern', 'standards', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'long', 'lost', 'cousin', 'performance', 'actually', 'so', 'stiff', 'unintentionally', 'comical', 'particularly', 'attempts', 'dance', 'end', 'Interestingly', 'Supremes', 'appear', 'right', 'JB', 'appealing', 'performance', 'early', 'hits', 'tame', 'polished', 'Godfather', 'wild', 'uninhibited', 'can', 'actually', 'count', '1-2-3-kick', 'Diana', 'co.', 'routines', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'go-go', 'girls', 'including', 'young', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'are', 'quite', 'fetching', 'hoot', 'end', 'see', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'slyly', 'cheking', 'out', 'cleavage', 'dancer', 'Debbie', 'Butler', 'So', 'fans', 'can', 'throw', 'away', 'cheap', 'unfocused', 'ahem..', 'unauthorized', 'DVDs', 'Step', 'right', 'up', 'get', 'REAL', 'THING', 'foundation', 'Rock', 'Soul.ADDENDUM', 'NOW', 'THAT', 'HAVE', 'AHEM', 'AUTHORIZED', 'DVD.The', 'liner', 'notes', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'wonderful', 'answer', 'question', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'who', 'were', 'go', 'go', 'dancers', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'audience', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'backstage', 'how', 'did', 'wonderful', 'show', 'come', 'together', 'etc', 'However', 'only', 'performer', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'form', 'subject', 'was', 'Dean', 'Torrence', 'Jan', 'Dean', 'who', 'discussed', 'experiences', 'recent', 'PBS', 'showing', 'special', 'John', 'Landis', 'who', 'was', 'Jr.', 'high', 'classmate', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'yes', 'THAT', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'shares', 'recollections', 'commentary', 'original', 'trailer', 'color', 'pictures', 'are', 'included', 'liner', 'notes', 'Director', 'Steve', 'Binder', 'wonderful', 'detailed', 'commentary', 'backstory', 'backstage', 'goings', 'especially', 'James', 'Brown', 'Supremes', 'footage', 'are', 'also', 'original', 'radio', 'commericals', 'what', 'ultimate', '60s', 'radio', 'DJ', 'stereotype', 'hi', 'groovy', 'guys', 'gals', 'short', 'just', 'get']",N/A

Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[0, 1]","In 1964 this special one time concert in Santa Monica presented a series of the biggest acts in the country for this performance before a group of enthusiasitc (and racially diverse) young people. You get acts from all the many tributaries of the pop music world of the time from British Invasion acts such as Gerry & The Pacemakers to Motown acts such as Smokey & The Miracles. Jan and Dean are the hosts and...well it's hard not to mention this DVD without mentioning how important one act is to this out of them all:James Brown. This performance alone captured James Brown at an important crossroads of his career. On the cusp of his career defining 1962 Apollo concert he is performing a tiny version of the song lineup from that concert along with his then big hit ""Out Of Seat"" with his Famous Flames. It's classic Brown in every respect. Another thing you'll notice about this DVD is you get to see the various pop and/or British invasion acts perform alongside the soul and rock n roll acts that inspired them in the first place. It must have been an honor to have Chuck Berry performing alongside Gerry & The Pacemakers,who actually switch places on one of Chuck Berry's tunes along with The Rolling Stones and even Beach Boys (whom Berry would later sue) all showing how much the acts influenced the other. And there there was not awkwardness: everyone was just giving their best and entertaining a watching and waiting crowd. You even here the same thing between Jan & Dean and The Beach Boys as even they are,by today's standards ""copying"" eachothers songs with minor changes but being so closely associated it's hardly noticable. You also see The Supremes,at this point getting their very first taste of pop stardom perform here as well. The Miracles may not be as known for this particularly song today but their performance of ""Mickey's Monkey"" really ignited a dance sensation with this crowd. The dancing,by the way ranges from typical 60's go-go styles to....what sometimes looks more like abstract modern movements. Marvin Gaye and The Rolling Stones,themselves both in their lesser known pre-superstardom years both give amazing performances here. You also see the lesser know band The Barbarians-many of whom,by 1964 standards had extremely long hair and a very outrageous almost proto punk/garage band image so you see where the future was going on all fronts. In the end everyone comes out for a song and dance encore;even JB gets his groove on with some of the more silly go-go dancers to ""show 'em how it's REALLY done"" as he begins to showcase his famous fancy footwork. It's wonderful this is again available to see and anyone who hasn't taken a look at it already is strongly advised to do so.",5,T.A.M.I Show-A Whole Lot Of Music Goin' On!!!,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,2721,"['1964', 'special', 'one', 'time', 'concert', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'presented', 'series', 'biggest', 'acts', 'country', 'performance', 'group', 'enthusiasitc', 'racially', 'diverse', 'young', 'people', 'get', 'acts', 'many', 'tributaries', 'pop', 'music', 'world', 'time', 'British', 'Invasion', 'acts', 'such', 'Gerry', 'Pacemakers', 'Motown', 'acts', 'such', 'Smokey', 'Miracles', 'Jan', 'Dean', 'are', 'hosts', 'well', 'hard', 'not', 'mention', 'DVD', 'mentioning', 'how', 'important', 'one', 'act', 'out', 'James', 'Brown', 'performance', 'alone', 'captured', 'James', 'Brown', 'important', 'crossroads', 'career', 'cusp', 'career', 'defining', '1962', 'Apollo', 'concert', 'performing', 'tiny', 'version', 'song', 'lineup', 'concert', 'then', 'big', 'hit', 'Seat', 'Famous', 'Flames', 'classic', 'Brown', 'respect', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'DVD', 'get', 'see', 'various', 'pop', 'and/or', 'British', 'invasion', 'acts', 'perform', 'soul', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'acts', 'inspired', 'first', 'place', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'honor', 'have', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'performing', 'alongside', 'Gerry', 'Pacemakers', 'who', 'actually', 'switch', 'places', 'one', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'tunes', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'even', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'whom', 'Berry', 'would', 'later', 'sue', 'showing', 'how', 'much', 'acts', 'influenced', 'other', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'awkwardness', 'everyone', 'was', 'just', 'giving', 'best', 'entertaining', 'watching', 'waiting', 'crowd', 'even', 'here', 'same', 'thing', 'Jan', 'Dean', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'even', 'are', 'today', 'standards', 'copying', 'eachothers', 'songs', 'minor', 'changes', 'being', 'so', 'closely', 'associated', 'hardly', 'noticable', 'also', 'see', 'Supremes', 'point', 'getting', 'very', 'first', 'taste', 'pop', 'stardom', 'perform', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Miracles', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'known', 'particularly', 'song', 'today', 'performance', 'Mickey', 'Monkey', 'really', 'ignited', 'dance', 'sensation', 'crowd', 'dancing', 'way', 'typical', '60', 'go-go', 'styles', '.what', 'more', 'abstract', 'modern', 'movements', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'lesser', 'known', 'pre-superstardom', 'years', 'give', 'amazing', 'performances', 'here', 'also', 'see', 'lesser', 'know', 'band', 'Barbarians-many', 'whom', '1964', 'standards', 'had', 'extremely', 'long', 'hair', 'very', 'outrageous', 'almost', 'proto', 'punk/garage', 'band', 'image', 'so', 'see', 'where', 'future', 'was', 'going', 'fronts', 'end', 'everyone', 'out', 'song', 'dance', 'encore', 'even', 'JB', 'groove', 'more', 'silly', 'go-go', 'dancers', 'show', 'how', 'REALLY', 'done', 'showcase', 'famous', 'fancy', 'footwork', 'wonderful', 'again', 'available', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'taken', 'look', 'already', 'strongly', 'advised', 'do', 'so']",N/A

Overall, they sounded a little underrehearsed for my comfort.In 1964, most of the acts on the T.A.M.I. show weren't even acquainted with their best (and future) hits.  Perhaps that's how one was able to get all those acts into one show:  in the end, the T.A.M.I. show was a glorified promotional junket designed to bring these artists to mainstream America (i.e., Mom, Pop and Corporate America--the kids obviously already knew of them). As a show, the performances (and songs) were very uneven.The early songs presented in this movie are historical curiosities at best.  Musically and lyrically speaking, they're derivative bubblegum pap, destined for the garbage heap of time.  (And what was up with Jan and Dean?  They weren't presented in the best light, to be sure!!!)I liked the Leslie Gore segment best: at the time this show was made, she knew/performed most of her hits, so she came across as the most mature in her career, with the obvious exception of Chuck Berry. The James Brown and Beach Boys segments were impressive, but one sensed that neither band has ""fully arrived"" in their mythology. The Supremes segment was uncommonly subdued--Diana Ross hasn't fully ""taken the lead"" at this time--as was Marvin Gaye's.  And was Smokey Robinson vocally deranged in this performance?  His voice was pretty rough around the edges, but the excitement he must have been feeling was wonderfully felt in the merciless shredding of his voice.  (The antics/choreography of the Miracles--and the Flames, for that matter--during their segments was clearly worth the price of the DVD, esp:  Brown's ""Night Train"".)  Chuck Berry segment(s) were subdued in that he minimized his stage antics. (Movie censorship issues?), As for Gerry and the Pacemakers, I actually enjoyed their segment but they looked pretty nervous or uncomfortable all throughout their appearances.All in all, the T.A.M.I. show is a very nice collector's item.  Excellent remastering, preservation and nice liner notes of the event(...wait:  where the Zombies ALSO scheduled to perform?  If so, then this DVD is still not complete).  The performers, represented in this DVD, were green in their mythology and for the most part come across as fascinating, hard working, but hardly satisfying.",3,I agree with G.

1046624,A3QC4SG7NA4ULG,B000MGUZDY,A reader,"[3, 6]","HEY!  Let's get some of the very best acts of the day in R&B; and rock 'n roll and bring them all together to do a live show!  We'll give each act a certain amount of time to present their material -- although not equally -- some, like Lesley Gore, get too much time to present unknown material and others, like the brilliant Miracles with Smokey Robinson in his prime, get too little.  We'll fill the audience with 13 year-old girls who are clearly coached to scream on cue for certain performers so loudly that you cannot hear them sing, but be quiet as church mice for others.  Then we'll pay not enough attention to the sound quality, which varies from very good to inaudible [note:  this could be a remastering issue, but who knows?].  And we'll pay even less attention to the camera work, so that sometimes we're staring at the butt of one of the Miracles, or drummer Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys at the exact moment his brother Carl is playing the guitar solo, or zooming in so closely on the Rolling Stones that bassist Bill Wyman is absent from the shot entirely, or panning back so far from James Brown that we can hardly see his fabulous, fancy footwork.  We'll have to hire somebody to direct the whole affair, complete with awkward segues by Jan & Dean and trendy, minimalist sets comprised of scaffolding, staircases and what look like rows and rows of shiny paper plates suspended from the ceiling.  Last but not least, we'll pack the sets to the rafters with a hoard of manic, twitching, gyrating, bikini- and tights-wearing go-go dancers.  Then we'll require those same go-go dancers to gambol and frolic on the stage in back of, to the sides of, IN FRONT OF, around and through the performers as they present their music.  (To be fair, Marvin Gaye and Chuck Berry seemed to be having a good time and not minding the plethora of go-go dancers in their midst, especially that one well-endowed brunette in a bikini.)But poor Miracles, poor Supremes...how did they stand it?  With all the effort they put into choreographing their acts down to the smallest hand gesture, to say nothing of the impeccable singing -- only to have a gaggle of frenetic dancers blast directly through the middle of their ensembles.  I know, it was 1964, and go-go dancing was an intrinsic part of the scene.  (Can somebody please remind me WHY?  I was there, I used to dance like that.  But seeing it now, I am grateful that, over time, certain aspects of pop culture have changed and evolved.)It was hard for me to get past the distracting and annoying presence of those go-go dancers, but there's no denying that some outstanding music was represented in the T.A.M.I. show.  It was a very fertile era for R&B; and rock 'n roll.  Soul, Motown, the British Invasion, surfer music...almost every act was well worth watching.  Smokey Robinson and the Miracles:  brilliant.  Ditto Marvin Gaye, James Brown (you'll see where Michael Jackson got his moves), the Stones, and Chuck Berry.  Teenager Lesley Gore had a great voice, even though she was dressed like a 45 year-old woman going to a bar mitzvah (I know about that, I'm Jewish).  The Supremes were the epitome of polish and poise.  Anything that includes the Beach Boys is fine by me, even though between the screaming and the bad sound it was hard to hear Brian's falsetto.  Even Gerry and the Pacemakers, who I remembered as a middling act, presented their hits with so much verve and sweat that I found myself singing along and smiling.  Is it just me, or did Gerry look like the Joker from Batman without make-up?Why the Barbarians were included, I can't say.  Maybe they had an uncle who knew somebody.  And whatever nostalgic feeling I might have had for Billy J. Kramer was lost after watching his set.  Despite his great tunes, most of which were written, I believe, by Lennon & McCartney, ""Little Children"" gave me the willies:  Hey little children, I'll give you candy and a quarter if you get lost so I can suck face with your sister.  And his back-up band, standing in a row as if in front of a firing squad, appeared to be having as much fun as ... as people in front of a firing squad.I wavered between three and four stars on this review, but settled on four, because why penalize the great performers for the sins of the producers?  Besides, it was a different time.  And how.

The Beach Boys were the crowned national-selling group that year in 1964 hosting this new-style entertainment and they closed the show to a deafening din. (Dennis Wilson lost 2 sets of drumsticks during their set)Seeing this, you would not think so. This re-splicing is not definitive, nor complete by any means. Having seen the concert back then 4 times and possessing an audio tape of the Beach Boys set alone for years, I will tell you they (Beach Boys)waz robbed here! This conert is fabulous for all other acts and I could play this all day, but it is clearly a demotion for the California group to have their 28 minute set that once closed the concert reduced to 4 songs and placed mid-show so the Stones could fictionally close the show.(Are they afraid to show that white people aided the soul groups here, instead of the other way around at the Apollo Club?) This is not cinema-verite but the crass substitution of political correctness and marketing stupidity for historical truth. Granted, surfing music is a distant memory unless you want to spice up your film a bit with ""Mickey's Monkey"" instead. Nowhere in the liner notes do they say this is complete, but they do insinuate that they found the ""lost"" Beach Boys segment. What an untruth. They had the set but halved it and demoted the band to sporting lads who let other exciting acts follow them, leaving Lesley Gore with more songs than the very hosts of the wing-ding. Give the white boys from Hawthorne their due, here. One can only hope that the Library of Congress version is the truthful documentary with the acts in proper order.

There is no concert anywhere outside of Woodstock you would see this much talent. Chuck Berry rocked. There was Motown. The British Invasion. The Surf sound. It had it all. One of the best performances you will ever see of James Brown as he tried to terrify the Rolling Stones before they went on. It's hilarious watching Mick Jagger try and do Mr Brown's moves as the Stones headlined and closed the show. Jagger makes an ass out of himself stumbling around the stage trying to imitate James Browns moves. Brian Jones was sensational as he co-starred with Jagger in the early days on stage.

I was a little disappointed, but it's still a great dvd.Surprisingly, my favorite segment is the opening with Chuck Berry and Gerry and The Pacemakers. Beginning with Chuck Berry, both acts take turns playing their hits. Chuck Berry, of course, is great and Gerry Marsden is very energetic. He and the band are clearly having fun and putting their all into the performance. He sings as if it's of the utmost importance to give it his best, and give it his best he does. No wonder John Lennon said Gerry and The Pacemakers were the only Liverpool band The Beatles were worried about as competition. Adding to the fun was watching the go-go dancers, especially during Chuck Berry's segments.The next act, The Miracles, led by Smokey Robinson was not so good. Smokey didn't seem to be in good voice, at least to me. Maybe it had to do with following such an energetic performance.Next was Marvin Gaye, performing some of his hits of that era. Even in those early days of his career, he was a great performer.Lesley Gore was up next, performing her hits, which were fun because they brought back memories. Even though she seemed to be giving it her all, the performance quickly became boring.Next Jan and Dean with performances of ""The Little Old Lady From Pasadena"" and ""Sidewalk Surfing"". It was fun watching them play with the skateboard. Seeing them during this and the opening theme of the show, they seem to have been experts on the skateboard.The Beach Boys gave a good performance of several of their hits, but their LOST CONCERT, which I own on VHS, was mostly the same songs, and a much better performance.The low point of the show was the next segment, with Billy J. Kramer and The Dakotas performing four of their hits. All but one, ""Little Children"", were Lennon/McCartney compositions. A performance by The Supremes follows Billy J. I like the studio recordings of B.J. and The Dakotas and also The Supremes, but both performances were mediocre.Next were The Barbarians,another low point, performing one song.Next is James Brown who gave a decent performance, but I've seen better performances by J.B.Of course The Rolling Stones were another highlight of the show. It's always great to see performances from the Brian Jones days.Even though I was disappointed with some of the performances, I still recommend this if you are a fan of the music from that era.",4,FUN TRIP TO THE PAST,1288396800,"10 30, 2010",2010,2460,"['expectations', 'show', 'were', 'set', 'very', 'high', 'hype', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'still', 'great', 'dvd.Surprisingly', 'favorite', 'segment', 'opening', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Gerry', 'Pacemakers', 'Beginning', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'acts', 'take', 'turns', 'playing', 'hits', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'course', 'great', 'Gerry', 'Marsden', 'very', 'energetic', 'band', 'are', 'clearly', 'having', 'fun', 'putting', 'performance', 'utmost', 'importance', 'give', 'best', 'give', 'best', 'No', 'wonder', 'John', 'Lennon', 'said', 'Gerry', 'Pacemakers', 'were', 'only', 'Liverpool', 'band', 'Beatles', 'were', 'worried', 'competition', 'Adding', 'fun', 'was', 'watching', 'go-go', 'dancers', 'especially', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'segments.The', 'next', 'act', 'Miracles', 'led', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'Smokey', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'good', 'voice', 'least', 'Maybe', 'had', 'do', 'following', 'such', 'energetic', 'performance.Next', 'was', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'performing', 'hits', 'era', 'Even', 'early', 'days', 'career', 'was', 'great', 'performer.Lesley', 'Gore', 'was', 'up', 'next', 'performing', 'hits', 'were', 'fun', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'Even', 'seemed', 'be', 'giving', 'performance', 'quickly', 'became', 'boring.Next', 'Jan', 'Dean', 'performances', 'Little', 'Old', 'Lady', 'From', 'Pasadena', 'Sidewalk', 'Surfing', 'was', 'fun', 'watching', 'play', 'skateboard', 'Seeing', 'opening', 'theme', 'show', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'experts', 'skateboard.The', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'gave', 'good', 'performance', 'several', 'hits', 'LOST', 'CONCERT', 'own', 'VHS', 'was', 'mostly', 'same', 'songs', 'much', 'better', 'performance.The', 'low', 'point', 'show', 'was', 'next', 'segment', 'Billy', 'J.', 'Kramer', 'Dakotas', 'performing', 'four', 'hits', 'one', 'Little', 'Children', 'were', 'Lennon/McCartney', 'compositions', 'performance', 'Supremes', 'Billy', 'J.', 'like', 'studio', 'recordings', 'B.J', 'Dakotas', 'also', 'Supremes', 'performances', 'were', 'mediocre.Next', 'were', 'Barbarians', 'low', 'point', 'performing', 'one', 'song.Next', 'James', 'Brown', 'who', 'gave', 'decent', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'performances', 'J.B.Of', 'course', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'were', 'highlight', 'show', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'performances', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'days.Even', 'was', 'disappointed', 'performances', 'still', 'recommend', 'are', 'fan', 'music', 'era']",N/A
1046642,A32IVQINWXFOXC,B000MGUZDY,"H. P. Keable ""more bass!""","[4, 5]","The booklet starts out with the above quote from Steven Van Zandt, and that encapsulates it very nicely.  A spectacular achievement in 1964, all the rave reviews are well-deserved.  Just a pity it took so long to get released.  I had the very low-fi truncated video release that was combined with the T.N.T. show (on Beta no less, how cool am I!...not!), which now proudly graces my garbage can until the next pickup.All the soul acts were wonderful, especially ""the Godfather"", but my main interest was to see the Beach Boys, and Gerry & the Pacemakers, and I was not disappointed.  I've never seen any film before with Brian Wilson in it.... a hero of my teenage years.  What a voice, and he barely opens his mouth!  One might think that even their early stuff like this wouldn't sound the same in a live setting because Brian used the studio to such an elevated degree, but they sounded magnificent.  I will definitely revisit their segment again and again (aah, the marvel of DVD chapter selection).Another huge favorite of mine, Gerry & the Pacemakers, were also a joy to behold.  Their piano was mostly inaudible, but the others made up for it, and Gerry's upbeat delivery is enormously contagious.  The producers had them staged as sort of sparring partners with Chuck Berry, a couple minutes of one then a couple minutes of the other, and back again, and again, but it actually came off quite well.Before I forget to say it.... this is the kind of show that Shindig and Hullabaloo should have taken a cue from.  I have a number of them on video, and they are often so lame I want to scream.  The TAMI show got it right.I've never been a girl-group devotee, but Leslie Gore was another marvel to watch and hear.  Eighteen years old in 1964, and already a confident, seasoned performer.  Wonderful voice, just wonderful.  I would have given you a different hair-do though, Les.  That one did not do you justice.  Too Brenda Lee.More than one reviewer has given Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas the thumbs down as being the weak spot on the show, but I disagree.  He was a little nervous, I think, and the Dakotas were kind of stiff, but he sang well.  The weak spot for me was the emcees, Jan & Dean.  No way they were gonna reproduce that hugely overlayered vocal sound of theirs live, and sure enough they didn't come within a mile of it.  If they had had two or more of the Beach Boys, even offstage, backing them up they would have been better.  Especially since ""Sidewalk Surfin"" is just different lyrics over Brian Wilson's ""Catch a Wave""!  C'est la vie.Many others have effused in great detail about the soul acts, and I can't add anything other than to say the extended closeups on Diana Ross during their final number were very nice.  And I kept thinking about Eddie Murphy's wonderful impression of James Brown during that set, lol.This is a gem that any true music fan should want to own regardless of your age.",5,The greatest rock movie you've never seen....,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,2927,"['booklet', 'out', 'above', 'quote', 'Steven', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'very', 'nicely', 'spectacular', 'achievement', '1964', 'rave', 'reviews', 'are', 'well-deserved', 'Just', 'pity', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'released', 'had', 'very', 'low-fi', 'truncated', 'video', 'release', 'was', 'combined', 'T.N.T', 'show', 'Beta', 'less', 'how', 'cool', 'am', 'not', 'now', 'proudly', 'graces', 'garbage', 'can', 'next', 'pickup.All', 'soul', 'acts', 'were', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'Godfather', 'main', 'interest', 'was', 'see', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Gerry', 'Pacemakers', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'hero', 'teenage', 'years', 'What', 'voice', 'barely', 'mouth', 'One', 'might', 'think', 'even', 'early', 'stuff', 'would', ""n't"", 'sound', 'same', 'live', 'setting', 'Brian', 'used', 'studio', 'elevated', 'degree', 'sounded', 'magnificent', 'will', 'definitely', 'revisit', 'segment', 'again', 'again', 'aah', 'marvel', 'DVD', 'chapter', 'selection', 'huge', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Gerry', 'Pacemakers', 'were', 'also', 'joy', 'behold', 'piano', 'was', 'mostly', 'inaudible', 'others', 'made', 'up', 'Gerry', 'upbeat', 'delivery', 'enormously', 'contagious', 'producers', 'had', 'staged', 'sort', 'sparring', 'partners', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'couple', 'minutes', 'one', 'then', 'couple', 'minutes', 'other', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'actually', 'came', 'quite', 'well.Before', 'forget', 'say', 'kind', 'show', 'Shindig', 'Hullabaloo', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'cue', 'have', 'number', 'video', 'are', 'often', 'so', 'lame', 'want', 'scream', 'TAMI', 'show', 'got', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'girl-group', 'devotee', 'Leslie', 'Gore', 'was', 'marvel', 'watch', 'hear', 'Eighteen', 'years', 'old', '1964', 'already', 'confident', 'seasoned', 'performer', 'Wonderful', 'voice', 'just', 'wonderful', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'different', 'hair-do', 'Les', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'Too', 'Brenda', 'Lee.More', 'one', 'reviewer', 'given', 'Billy', 'J.', 'Kramer', 'Dakotas', 'thumbs', 'down', 'being', 'weak', 'spot', 'show', 'disagree', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'think', 'Dakotas', 'were', 'kind', 'stiff', 'sang', 'well', 'weak', 'spot', 'was', 'emcees', 'Jan', 'Dean', 'way', 'were', 'gon', 'reproduce', 'hugely', 'overlayered', 'vocal', 'sound', 'theirs', 'live', 'sure', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'mile', 'had', 'had', 'two', 'more', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'even', 'offstage', 'backing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Especially', 'Sidewalk', 'Surfin', 'just', 'different', 'lyrics', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'Catch', 'Wave', ""C'est"", 'la', 'vie.Many', 'others', 'have', 'effused', 'great', 'detail', 'soul', 'ca', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'other', 'say', 'extended', 'closeups', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'final', 'number', 'were', 'very', 'nice', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'wonderful', 'impression', 'James', 'Brown', 'set', 'lol.This', 'gem', 'true', 'music', 'fan', 'should', 'want', 'own', 'regardless', 'age']",N/A

I was laughing hysterically during his antics. It's a teenage rock n roll show, James, not an exorcism. Lighten up, crazy man! He continually flings off his fitted cape like a toddler having a tantrum, after which two of his stage men pat him on the shoulder like a consoling mother. ""There, there, James, it's gonna be alright."" Wherever James Brown belonged, it wasn't on stage at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in 1964 with rock n rollers who got it right. It's interesting who really scores during this show--and who doesn't. James Brown bombs, but so do the Rolling Stones who follow him and all the Motown acts. The Motowners are simply too polished and ""nightclub"" for this wild teenage rave up. With their well-rehearsed steps and ""charm school"" manners, The Supremes, Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson seem ""grown up"" and old before their time even though they were still in their early '20s. They belonged in Vegas & Miami Beach hotels in front of the parents, not these screaming kids from Santa Monica High. The Rolling Stones are mediocre as well and sound amateurish compared to the other British Invaders who easily out-performed them. It would still be a year before ""Satisfaction"" and their great songs rolled out; here Mick is obviously ""inspired"" by James Brown with his herky-jerky stage routine. Mick has always been overrated as a performer and he's full of himself and painful to watch as usual. The rest of the Stones kinda stand there, like Stones that aren't rolling. Who got it right? The old man out of the starting gate, Chuck Berry. Chuck was easily a decade older than the other performers. But he reminds everyone what rock n roll is all about: HAVING A GREAT TIME!! Chuck was hard-nosed backstage demanding cash up-front. On the boards he rips through his classics with energy and humor and seems to be enjoying himself. Girls, cars, school. Chuck Berry = Rock N Roll!!! He's joined mid-performance by Gerry & The Pacemakers. They belt out their version of Chuck's songs and their own Pacemaker hits. Chuck & The Pacemakers may have been a strange hook-up. It works though, and really ignites the show. Pure dynamite! Also surprisingly good is Billy J. Kramer, a second-tier British Invader who was supposedly the most nervous act on the bill. He comes across like a guy who could have won American Idol in 1964. Nervous or not, I really liked his set. Another great surprise is Leslie Gore, still a teenager in 1964. She's a good-looking, engaging performer with a great voice, and her live versions of ""boyfriend songs"" are better than what you've heard on the radio. She really belts 'em out. (Hard to believe she turned out to be a lesbian.) The Beach Boys arrived from nearby Redondo Beach, the hometown guys. They're listenable, as usual. However, the REAL STARS of this show are a bunch of dudes you never heard of, THE BARBARIANS! Who? What? Where? That's what I was asking myself as this wild, kick-ass garage band was showing what mid-60s music is all about!! They steal the show out of nowhere. They only got one song in the movie, and promptly faded into rock n roll obscurity.",4,James Brown nearly destroys legendary show,1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,3327,"['face', 'twisted', 'up', 'agony', 'awful', 'voice', 'screeching', 'animal', 'writhing', 'stage', 'lunatic', 'James', 'Brown', 'nearly', 'legendary', 'show', 'thought', 'should', 'be', 'headliner', 'was', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'antics', 'teenage', 'rock', 'roll', 'show', 'James', 'not', 'exorcism', 'Lighten', 'up', 'crazy', 'man', 'continually', 'fitted', 'cape', 'toddler', 'having', 'tantrum', 'two', 'stage', 'men', 'pat', 'shoulder', 'consoling', 'mother', 'James', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'alright', 'Wherever', 'James', 'Brown', 'belonged', 'was', ""n't"", 'stage', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'Civic', 'Auditorium', '1964', 'rock', 'n', 'rollers', 'who', 'got', 'right', 'interesting', 'who', 'really', 'show', 'who', ""n't"", 'James', 'Brown', 'bombs', 'so', 'do', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'who', 'follow', 'Motown', 'acts', 'Motowners', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'polished', 'nightclub', 'wild', 'teenage', 'rave', 'up', 'well-rehearsed', 'steps', 'charm', 'school', 'manners', 'Supremes', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'seem', 'grown', 'up', 'old', 'time', 'even', 'were', 'still', 'early', ""'20s"", 'belonged', 'Vegas', 'Miami', 'Beach', 'hotels', 'front', 'parents', 'not', 'screaming', 'kids', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'High', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'are', 'mediocre', 'well', 'sound', 'amateurish', 'compared', 'other', 'British', 'Invaders', 'who', 'easily', 'out-performed', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'year', 'Satisfaction', 'great', 'songs', 'rolled', 'out', 'here', 'Mick', 'obviously', 'inspired', 'James', 'Brown', 'herky-jerky', 'stage', 'routine', 'Mick', 'always', 'been', 'overrated', 'performer', 'full', 'painful', 'watch', 'usual', 'rest', 'Stones', 'kinda', 'stand', 'there', 'Stones', 'are', ""n't"", 'rolling', 'Who', 'got', 'right', 'old', 'man', 'starting', 'gate', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Chuck', 'was', 'easily', 'decade', 'older', 'other', 'performers', 'everyone', 'what', 'n', 'roll', 'HAVING', 'GREAT', 'TIME', 'Chuck', 'was', 'hard-nosed', 'backstage', 'demanding', 'cash', 'up-front', 'boards', 'classics', 'energy', 'humor', 'be', 'enjoying', 'Girls', 'cars', 'school', 'Chuck', 'Berry', '=', 'Rock', 'N', 'Roll', 'joined', 'mid-performance', 'Gerry', 'Pacemakers', 'belt', 'out', 'version', 'Chuck', 'songs', 'own', 'Pacemaker', 'hits', 'Chuck', 'Pacemakers', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'strange', 'hook-up', 'really', 'show', 'Pure', 'dynamite', 'Also', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Billy', 'J.', 'Kramer', 'second-tier', 'British', 'Invader', 'who', 'was', 'supposedly', 'most', 'nervous', 'act', 'bill', 'guy', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'won', 'American', 'Idol', '1964', 'Nervous', 'not', 'really', 'liked', 'set', 'great', 'surprise', 'Leslie', 'Gore', 'still', 'teenager', '1964', 'good-looking', 'engaging', 'performer', 'great', 'voice', 'live', 'versions', 'boyfriend', 'songs', 'are', 'better', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'radio', 'really', 'belts', 'out', 'Hard', 'believe', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'lesbian', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'arrived', 'nearby', 'Redondo', 'Beach', 'hometown', 'guys', ""'re"", 'listenable', 'usual', 'However', 'REAL', 'STARS', 'show', 'are', 'bunch', 'dudes', 'never', 'heard', 'BARBARIANS', 'Who', 'What', 'Where', 'what', 'was', 'asking', 'wild', 'kick-ass', 'garage', 'band', 'was', 'showing', 'what', 'mid-60s', 'music', 'steal', 'show', 'nowhere', 'only', 'got', 'one', 'song', 'movie', 'promptly', 'faded', 'rock', 'roll', 'obscurity']",N/A

But, what can you expect from an authentic live performance? These are not faults; it's reality.It's possible, perhaps likely, this is not the entire show as seen at the Santa Monica Civic. But, before you rise up and accuse me of being one of those who think acts are still missing (hint: THE GREAT TNT SHOW!!!!!!), let me aver. It's my belief this is the broadcast version of the show that was seen in theaters across the country. I say this because there is a jerky, in-and-out sense to many of the intros by Jan & Dean that leave me thinking something is missing. And, while we are on the subject of Jan & Dean, let me also suggest that the Laurel and Hardy of surf music might have been lip-syncing. I could be wrong, but the renditions seem too close to the record.None of this really matters and it should not affect yoiur buying decision. Look, you don't buy this DVD for clarity and fidelity.  No visual media could give you that in 1964 and very, very few of us could afford the sort of sound system that woyuld reproduce what was recorded in studio.

There are a lot of great performances here but James Brown and the Famous Flames are the greatest here by far.I loved seeing the Beach Boys with Dennis, Carl and Brian again.  Brian is firmly in control here and they sound great.  Also of interest is one song by The Barbarians from Cape Cod.  I watched their 1 song set and was blown away by the drummer... not even noticing until I read about it the next day that the drummer has one hand!  You can clearly see it when you look for it- they kind of showcase it but he was so good I didn't even notice.It was good to see the original Rolling Stones here but they are kind of a let down after seeing what James Brown did.

I was 14 and madly in love with The Beatles. My friend and I arrived at the movie theater early in the morning to get in line for ""A Hard Day's Night."" ""The T.A.M.I. Show"" was playing with it as a double feature (remember those?)We Beatle-mad little girls resented having to sit through 2 hours of who-knows-what before seeing our idols. Sure, we liked Lesley Gore, Jan and Dean, and the Beach Boys, but they were just a distraction. The Rolling Stones were vaguely threatening to us with their overt sexuality, although we didn't really know that was what made us uncomfortable at the time, because we were truly innocents.Well, about 90 minutes into the show, here came James Brown. I must have heard his music before, since he already had hit records, but i was focused on the new British imports and maybe I didn't pay attention. When I saw his performance on the T.A.M.I. Show, my mind was entirely blown. Never in my young life had I seen anything like him. Even the Rolling Stones seemed tame by comparison.So here it is almost 50 years later, and I saw a documentary about the night James Brown sang in Boston the day after the Martin Luther King assassination (great movie, by the way). And I started thinking about the first time I ever experienced James Brown. I looked online for The T.A.M.I. Show and discovered that it had finally been released in its original form a few years back. Promptly ordered it, put it on to play as soon as it arrived, and it's everything I remembered and a whole lot more. Quentin Tarantino is quoted on the box ""In the top three of all rock movies"" and I have to agree. In fact, I can't think of anything to rival it at the moment.It's hard to mention highlights, since most of the show is highlights, but a young Smoky Robinson is riveting, Marvin Gaye is fantastic, The Supremes (before they were Diana Ross and) Lesley Gore is better than you think she was! and the Beach Boys, of course, are great.But oh, that James Brown.

However, I have always been a huge fan of '60s music, so I am elated to find out this terrific event in the history of music is FINALLY being officially released. It took me YEARS to see the TAMI Show, and when I did, I was not at all disappointed.Taped in the fall of 1964 at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium before a large crowd of screaming teenagers, mainly girls, this concert featured some of the most popular and talented musical acts of not just 1964, but of all time. Hosted by the good-looking, lively duo Jan and Dean, one by one the stage was lit up with amazing artists.Just picture it- the Supremes, James Brown, the Rolling Stones, Chuck Berry, Marvin Gaye, Lesley Gore, Smokey and the Miracles, and my favorite group of all, the Beach Boys. This DVD includes their performance, which had been cut from the original. They perform four of their hits here. Each artist or group comes on stage, and performs, back to back. At one point, Chuck Berry and Gerry and the Pacemakers trade off on ""Maybelline"". They were all so young at the time, at the peak of their heyday, and in their prime. Jan and Dean performed as well, right after Lesley Gore.All of the performers were superb, to say the very least. However, James Brown, and his Famous Flames, really stole the show. They were dynamic and electrifying. Word has it Mick Jagger and the rest of the Stones were reluctant on go on afterwards. They had nothing to worry about, though. Their performance was very exciting, thrilling, and just ripe with sex appeal.When you think about it, this is also a tribute to those performers who are no longer with us- Florence Ballard, Dennis Wilson, Marvin Gaye, Jan Berry, James Brown, Ronnie White, Brian Jones...Again, this concert is a very rare jewel, and I look forward to owning it- again.",5,A Piece of Musical History,1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,1875,"['TAMI', 'Show', 'took', 'place', 'time', 'was', 'Mother', 'generation', 'However', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', ""'60s"", 'music', 'am', 'elated', 'find', 'out', 'terrific', 'event', 'history', 'music', 'FINALLY', 'being', 'officially', 'released', 'took', 'YEARS', 'see', 'TAMI', 'Show', 'when', 'did', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.Taped', 'fall', '1964', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'Civic', 'Auditorium', 'large', 'crowd', 'screaming', 'teenagers', 'mainly', 'girls', 'concert', 'featured', 'most', 'popular', 'talented', 'musical', 'acts', 'not', 'just', '1964', 'time', 'Hosted', 'good-looking', 'lively', 'duo', 'Jan', 'Dean', 'one', 'one', 'stage', 'was', 'lit', 'up', 'amazing', 'artists.Just', 'picture', 'it-', 'Supremes', 'James', 'Brown', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'Lesley', 'Gore', 'Smokey', 'Miracles', 'favorite', 'group', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'DVD', 'performance', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'original', 'perform', 'four', 'hits', 'here', 'artist', 'group', 'stage', 'performs', 'back', 'back', 'one', 'point', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Gerry', 'Pacemakers', 'trade', 'off', 'Maybelline', 'were', 'so', 'young', 'time', 'peak', 'heyday', 'prime', 'Jan', 'Dean', 'performed', 'as', 'well', 'right', 'Lesley', 'Gore.All', 'performers', 'were', 'superb', 'say', 'very', 'least', 'However', 'James', 'Brown', 'Famous', 'Flames', 'really', 'stole', 'show', 'were', 'dynamic', 'electrifying', 'Word', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'rest', 'Stones', 'were', 'reluctant', 'go', 'afterwards', 'had', 'nothing', 'worry', 'about', 'though', 'performance', 'was', 'very', 'exciting', 'thrilling', 'just', 'ripe', 'sex', 'appeal.When', 'think', 'also', 'tribute', 'performers', 'who', 'are', 'longer', 'us-', 'Florence', 'Ballard', 'Dennis', 'Wilson', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'Jan', 'Berry', 'James', 'Brown', 'Ronnie', 'White', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'Again', 'concert', 'very', 'rare', 'jewel', 'look', 'forward', 'owning', 'it-', 'again']",N/A

1046662,A1DVAODGX47GJL,B000MGUZDY,mojo_navigator,"[1, 2]","For 46 years, The TAMI show has had a legendary and near mythical status.  The vast majority of us had never seen it save for the odd poor quality clip here and there and had to be content with what we read in history books.  Now it's finally available to the masses after much legal wrangling and so was it worth the wait? Is it all it was cracked to be?  The answer is a loud, resounding yes.  And much, much more.  It's a film that succeeds on every level - cinematic, choreographic, musical.  It accurately captures the passion and excitement of '60s teenage life and the music that fuelled it at the peak of its years of vitality,  decades before the tired middle-aged heritage industry kicked in.  All the excitement that this music once had is brought vividly to life again.The performances do vary, its true.  I can't imagine anyone getting much of a kick out of Gerry and the Pacemakers, Jan and Dean or even Lesley Gore for that matter today.  However the vast majority of the acts deliver performances that are so mesmerising that they'll remain in your mind's eye for days after.  When you see Chuck Berry in this film, you won't see dated nostalgia.  You'll be transported to the sound, feel and attitude of Rock `n' Roll as it originally was, a sound that galvanised youth to heights of near religious mania.  The Beach Boys are a similar revelation - tight, punchy, fast and deathlessly thrilling.  And The Barbarians, how did these dudes even get on this show??!!  Glad that they did - an excellent example of crude `60s garage rock that everybody should get to see.The above would be enough to recommend this film alone but the real crown jewel is the final two performances, that of James Brown and The Stones.  JB - well, you really have to witness this to believe it.  It has an intensity that stretches over time-spans and generations, transcends any notion of datedness and relevance.  And the way that the segment is edited and the crowd reaction (who incidentally were not coached and hollered their heads off genuinely in the heat of passion) compounds the unsettling potency of this performance.  Much has been made of the fact that poor old Mick and the boys had to follow The Godfather but on this evidence you wouldn't have thought it.  They just launch straight into their tough R & B with snarling guitars, pounding rhythms and mean Jagger-esque presence.  It's a powerful sexualised, punk-blues performance that gets heartbeats a-racing.  And it seems SO RIGHT to have appeared at the end.But that could pretty sum up everything about The TAMI Show - everything is SO RIGHT.  This is way more heartfelt and involving than I ever could have imagined.

It was one of the seminal music experiences of my young life, ranking with seeing the Beatles live at old Boston Garden, and the Stones' first US Tour performance in Lynn, MA, and Dylan a year later at Symphony Hall. I've been waiting for decades for The T.A.M.I. Show to be released in its entirety on DVD so I eagerly bought this. Well, I'm still waiting.The good part of this DVD is that, unlike the videotaped version entitled BORN TO ROCK, the performances included are complete, all the songs the artists performed are there and no pieces have been cut out. The bad part, and to my mind its unconscionable, is that some of the greatest artists have been just dropped from the program. Missing are: BO DIDDLY (with The Duchess on bass guitar), IKE & TINA TURNER, THE RONETTS, and the high priest, RAY CHARLES. What idiot arbitrarily determined to drop giants like these in phenomenal performances? I hope, and like to think, that some kid who has no first hand information about the music of this era, acquired the rights to these performances and decided to drop performers he hadn't heard of so the program would fit on one disk. I suspect, more likely, that in ten years the ultimate, director's cut of the T.A.M.I. Show will be offered on whatever format is being used then, in faux HD, faux 7.1, colorized, with picture book and commentary by Justin Timberlake, and these missing performances included. The faithful will no doubt be relied on to fork over $59.99 for this ""complete"" program, and in my case, they may well be right. I loved the way little Ronnie Bennett shakes during her performance of SHOUT in the original program. To you, who are reading this, I recommend locking your $13.99 in CD.

Lesley Gore stands out as surprisingly powerful, especially the 'You Don't Own Me'. The Beach Boys are at their peak, and you remember that Dennis was a good drummer and Carl loved his Chuck Berry licks. James Brown steals the show. Now we know what all the fuss was about. And the Rolling Stones acquit themselves nicely, though the camera inexplicably zeros in on Brian Jone's face, instead of his guitar playing for his blues solo on 'Time Is On My Side'.

1046677,AOL6BG6SAFGQF,B000MGUZDY,Rufus Quail,"[3, 7]","The James Brown performance alone is worth the price. One gripe: They play ""Night Train"" at warp speed. It's nearly impossible to recognize the great tune. The main attraction of the Brown performance is the comical cape routine.As a bonus, you get Marvin Gaye, the Supremes, and the Stones. If you're not a fan of Gerry & The Pacemakers, Jan and Dean, Billy J. Kramer, and an outfit called the Barbarians, you'll have to suffer/fast forward through their turns. How the Barbarians got this gig is beyond me.I thought it was horrible that Chuck Berry got short shrift and had to share the stage with a forgettable act like Gerry & The Pacemakers. The only thing to recommend their time onstage is watching the peculiar contortions of the lead singer's lips. With certain twitches, the audience of mostly teenage girls erupts into hysterics. Throughout the show you have to cope with the dreadful screaming.Seeing a fresh-faced Mick Jagger is fascinating. I thought the Stones' performance was surprisingly polished and professional. Marvin Gaye is wonderfully elegant in the Nat King Cole mold. The Supremes are pure grace and perfection. Every tiny motion and gesture is calculated. But it works. This performance shows how charming the girls were, even if Diana's big hair is a bit distracting.I can see why the wacky dad wanted the Beach Boys performance removed. Not that it's bad, it doesn't have the zing you might expect from their joyous recordings. They are strangely listless. It had to be an unhappy time for the Boys. Poor Brian looks haunted.The movie has value as a document of the times. This is the era of the dorky dance, and you get to see your fill (and more). Dances from the time include the frug, the chicken, the monkey, the dog, the pony, the hully-gully, the watusi, the swim, and the jerk, to name just a few. I have no idea which ones are performed in the TAMI Show. Some lunatic thought that seeing a great lineup of prominent acts wouldn't be enough. You had to have all these hyperactive dancers shimmyin' and shakin' all over. At one point, the dancers actually disrupt the poor Supremes.You see Jan and Dean skateboarding around LA. Yes, there were crude skateboards back then. When the camera pans the audience, you see the goofy kids. Just how I looked. A cop in riot gear patrols the aisles, ready  to bust heads at the first sign of teenage rebellion. Those nerdy adults are chaperones.The only time you see a close-up of a black kid is when there's a black performer onstage. This is 1964, the year of the Civil Rights Act. The horrifying Watts Riots were just months away. Back then, showing black kids and white kids together was probably daring and possibly even scandalous.The sound recording is pretty dismal but you have to remember how primitive the equipment was back then. Because so much time was given the marginal acts, I was disappointed. How is it that Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas get as much or more stage time as Smokey Robinson, Chuck Berry, or Marvin Gaye for godsakes? It's criminal!For fans of this type of nostalgia, however, the TAMI Show is a must, so I'll recommend it without hesitation.",4,Worthwhile document. Too much screaming!

And though my TV screen is only 27 inches (not a wide screen model) the print looks great and the sound is the best I can hope for. (Note on sound: Director Steve Binder mixed the original film in MONO so don't expect stereo. It just ""ain't gonna happen"".)Many PBS stations have been showing this restored version of the film this month (March 2010) but its probably more of an infomercial. There's an hour of pledge breaks to cut it up. Besides you will miss the bonus features!Since I'm sure others will comment on the detailed performances (hey they are ALL great and everyone has their favorite), I'll use this space to comment on the Bonus features of this ""Collectors Edition"" (It's the ONLY edition out there on DVD). First up is the full-length commentary by Director Steve Binder and music journalist Don Waller (who write the nice 20-page book of liner notes, but is not credited on the package as being on the commentary track). After some general info on how the concert came about - repeating some of the info in the liner notes - Binder starts commenting on the action on the screen. Shout Factory did a nice job of balancing the soundtrack with the commentary so the soundtrack doesn't overpower Binder's and Waller's comments. I won't spoil the fun of having you listen to the commentary by revealing some favorite moments.The remaining bonus features are three short radio spots and the 4 minute Trailer for the film. You can also watch the trailer with a commentary by Director John Landis (""Animal House"") who was actually in the audience at the T.A.M.I concert. His commentary is a waste IMHO because its more of an ad for the website [...] and Landis must have been sleeping through the concert - and obviously not watching this DVD because he mentions that Stevie Wonder is in the show. (Nope, he isn't though Marvin, Smokey and the Supremes are!).So stop reading the reviews and just go out and get the DVD, especially if - like me - you've waited 46 years (!) to see it again!Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"Finally!

Show.  T.A.M.I. was used as a shortened version of the name Teenage Awards Music International, also known as Teen Age Music International. This 1964 concert show was filmed in 2 days and the best of the film's footage was used for the two hour movie which was shown in theaters all around the world. The director Steve Binder and his crew from the Steve Allen show filmed this concert with tv camera's and recorded it in Electronovision-one of the first ever high definition video camera's that captured 1000 to 1100 lines at 25 fps. The resolution of this film was super high definition and way ahead of it's time!The concert was filmed at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium and was emceed by Jan and Dean. The director Steve Binder begins the movie with great shots of the streets of Santa Monica showing Jan and Dean skate boarding on the streets and the rest of the groups getting ready for the concert. It is absolutely wonderful to see what life looked like on the streets of Santa Monica back in 1964, and especially seeing those very first skate boards! For those of us that were around back then, it brings back all those great sixties memories, especially if you were a teenager!James Brown (and The Flames) was at his best with his great singing and dancing as were The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, Chuck Berry, The Barbarians, Marvin Gaye, Gerry and The Pacemakers, Lesley Gore, Jan and Dean, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles and The Supremes. It was a concert composed of great music from both America and Britain. The film was released by American International Pictures on December 29, 1964. The stage in the auditorium held only the musicians and some fantastic go-go dancers, so the focus of these great early hi-def type camera's is completely on the great groups! If you look at the go-go dancers, you will see a teenage Teri Garr(She's got on a sweatshirt over a bikini with her blonde flip hair-do in the opening shots)!This show was the coolest big screen movie of it's time, filmed with great early hi-tech camera's and now it's finally on dvd! For years, no one could get the rights from all the great groups involved in this project, but they finally made a deal that satisfied all the groups, so now we finally get this music treasure on dvd! Shout!Factory's extras are new footage commentary by director Steve Binder, along with the great original trailer, radio spots and a commemorative booklet. With this fabulous concert show being filmed in the cleanest, sharpest picture in 1964, I can't imagine how it looks even more cleaned up in hi-def and UNCUT!

1046686,A3H7DVRC2QLH6S,B000MGUZDY,"T. McCool ""Musicologist""","[4, 5]","First, to answer a few points that have been made in other reviews/comments. This was shot with TV cameras for theatrical release. It was never shown on TV. Also, Chuck Berry performs with Gerry and the Pacemakers because in the 60s and to this day, Chuck never toured with his own band. Promoters in each city had to provide a stage band for Chuck, and any musician who didn't cut his musical chops on Chuck's songs didn't deserve to share the stage with him anyway. OK, now that's out of the way.The clarity of this *film* is remarkable, so you HD nerds don't need to waste your time worrying about it. It is incredibly sharp. You get the entire film as it was shown, with no cuts or edits. The sound is also incredibly clear, regardless of the time. Some of the artists use backing tracks and/or an off-stage house band. But the vocals are all live.Most of the performances are remarkable. Yes, there are some forgettable and long forgotten artists but it was 1964 and all of these acts had hits on the charts. Occasionally, dancers jump around on stage and it seems kind of silly and distracting, but again, that was the times. What you get is likely the best James Brown performance ever captured on film. The Beach Boys prove that they could really rock. Marvin Gaye also delivers a great performance, showing some of the greatness that would follow. It's also kind of sad watching him knowing how his life would tragically end. Diana Ross and the Supremes also deliver; Ross' voice is crystal clear and beautiful. The Stones provide a rare live performance of Off The Hook, an obscure early Jagger/Richards penned gem. To have this film of a pre-Satisfaction Stones performance is a treasure.Yes, I will buy this and I can't wait.",4,"Great quality, great show.",1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,1737,"['First', 'answer', 'few', 'points', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'other', 'reviews/comments', 'was', 'shot', 'TV', 'cameras', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'never', 'shown', 'TV', 'Also', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Gerry', 'Pacemakers', '60s', 'day', 'Chuck', 'never', 'toured', 'own', 'band', 'Promoters', 'city', 'had', 'provide', 'stage', 'band', 'Chuck', 'musician', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'musical', 'chops', 'Chuck', 'songs', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'share', 'stage', 'anyway', 'OK', 'now', 'way.The', 'clarity', '*film*', 'remarkable', 'HD', 'nerds', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'waste', 'time', 'worrying', 'incredibly', 'sharp', 'get', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'shown', 'cuts', 'edits', 'sound', 'also', 'incredibly', 'clear', 'regardless', 'time', 'artists', 'use', 'backing', 'tracks', 'and/or', 'off-stage', 'house', 'band', 'vocals', 'are', 'live.Most', 'performances', 'are', 'remarkable', 'Yes', 'are', 'forgettable', 'long', 'forgotten', 'artists', 'was', '1964', 'acts', 'had', 'hits', 'charts', 'Occasionally', 'dancers', 'jump', 'around', 'stage', 'kind', 'silly', 'distracting', 'again', 'was', 'times', 'What', 'get', 'likely', 'best', 'James', 'Brown', 'performance', 'ever', 'captured', 'film', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'prove', 'could', 'really', 'rock', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'also', 'great', 'performance', 'showing', 'greatness', 'would', 'follow', 'also', 'kind', 'sad', 'watching', 'knowing', 'how', 'life', 'would', 'tragically', 'end', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Supremes', 'also', 'deliver', 'Ross', 'voice', 'crystal', 'clear', 'beautiful', 'Stones', 'provide', 'rare', 'live', 'performance', 'Off', 'Hook', 'obscure', 'early', 'Jagger/Richards', 'penned', 'gem', 'have', 'film', 'pre-Satisfaction', 'Stones', 'performance', 'treasure.Yes', 'will', 'buy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait']",N/A

1046688,A2SFIVMEKZ2RHP,B000MGUZDY,willgee,"[3, 5]","One fact THAT VIRTUALLY NO ONE commenting on this set has mentioned is that JAMES BROWN did NOT record or perform these tunes alone. He did it with the help of some other men with whom he started his career.The men that you see on this DVD.  Those men were a singing group called THE FAMOUS FLAMES.I agree with your review of  ""Mr Dynamite"" James Brown . However , kudos should also be given to his original singing group, the Famous Flames , Bobby Bennett, Lloyd Stallworth, and the recently deceased late ,great Bobby Byrd. It wasn't just James that was up there doing all that singing and dancing. (and ,as I've said many times before on this site, ""The Famous Flames"" is NOT the name of James Browns BAND , they are a SINGING GROUP ). Their explosive performance  , especially ""Prisoner of Love"", ""Please Please Please"" and ""Night Train"" BROUGHT THE HOUSE DOWN !!! James and The Flames literally STOLE THE SHOW and left The Rolling Stones eating DUST !!!Yes, believe it or not (and I know that this is going to be a shock to some of you ), JAMES BROWN DID NOT BEGIN HIS CAREER AS A SOLO ARTIST. In 1953, singer/songwriter BOBBY BYRD formed the Famous Flames. He is also credited as the man who DISCOVERED JAMES BROWN .  James Brown joined Bobby Byrd's group, the Flames , and the rest , as they say, is history. James Brown was actually a MEMBER of The Famous Flames. They were NOT just ""backup"" singers to HIM.  He was a part of the group too. Almost NO ONE reviewing this DVD has given any credit to THE FAMOUS FLAMES . THESE GUYS WERE JUST INDUCTED into the ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME. LET'S GIVE THEM THEIR PROPS . Their performance was just as exciting and explosive as James Brown's was !!Favorable mention must ALSO be given to Motown's  mighty MIRACLES  (Smokey,Bobby, Ronnie, Pete, and Marv on guitar ) who put on a dynamic perfomance as well ,especially on their million sellers "" You've Really Got A Hold On Me "" and ""Mickey's Monkey"" .BY FAR, the two BEST groups on the show !!!***UPDATE***  CONGRATULATIONS to The MIRACLES (Motown's first group, Bobby Rogers, Ronnie White, Pete Moore, Marv Tarplin, and Claudette Robinson,who wasn't on the film, as she had retired from live shows earlier that year) and to the mighty FAMOUS FLAMES (Bobby Byrd, Bobby Bennett, and Lloyd Stallworth) for FINALLY getting inducted into THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME in 2012...some 27 years after their front men, Smokey Robinson and James Brown , respectively, were inducted. I credit the release of THE T.A.M.I. Show on DVD in 2009 for finally helping people to remember that Robinson AND Brown ACTUALLY STARTED THEIR RESPECTIVE CAREERS AS MEMBERS OF GROUPS ...AND not AS ""SOLO"" ARTISTS...and that The Miracles and The Famous Flames should have been inducted with their lead singers DECADES AGO.",5,IT WASN'T JUST JAMES...IT WAS ALSO THE FAMOUS FLAMES !!!,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,2795,"['One', 'fact', 'THAT', 'VIRTUALLY', 'NO', 'ONE', 'commenting', 'set', 'mentioned', 'JAMES', 'BROWN', 'did', 'NOT', 'record', 'perform', 'tunes', 'alone', 'did', 'help', 'other', 'men', 'whom', 'started', 'career.The', 'men', 'see', 'DVD', 'men', 'were', 'singing', 'group', 'called', 'THE', 'FAMOUS', 'FLAMES.I', 'agree', 'review', 'Mr', 'Dynamite', 'James', 'Brown', 'However', 'kudos', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'given', 'original', 'singing', 'group', 'Famous', 'Flames', 'Bobby', 'Bennett', 'Lloyd', 'Stallworth', 'recently', 'deceased', 'late', 'great', 'Bobby', 'Byrd', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'James', 'was', 'up', 'there', 'doing', 'singing', 'dancing', ""'ve"", 'said', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'site', 'Famous', 'Flames', 'NOT', 'name', 'James', 'Browns', 'BAND', 'are', 'SINGING', 'GROUP', 'explosive', 'performance', 'especially', 'Prisoner', 'Love', 'Please', 'Please', 'Please', 'Night', 'Train', 'BROUGHT', 'THE', 'HOUSE', 'DOWN', 'James', 'Flames', 'literally', 'STOLE', 'THE', 'SHOW', 'left', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'eating', 'DUST', 'Yes', 'believe', 'not', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'shock', 'JAMES', 'BROWN', 'DID', 'NOT', 'BEGIN', 'HIS', 'CAREER', 'A', 'SOLO', 'ARTIST', '1953', 'singer/songwriter', 'BOBBY', 'BYRD', 'formed', 'Famous', 'Flames', 'also', 'credited', 'man', 'who', 'JAMES', 'BROWN', 'James', 'Brown', 'joined', 'Bobby', 'Byrd', 'group', 'Flames', 'rest', 'say', 'history', 'James', 'Brown', 'was', 'actually', 'MEMBER', 'Famous', 'Flames', 'were', 'NOT', 'just', 'backup', 'singers', 'HIM', 'was', 'part', 'group', 'too', 'ONE', 'reviewing', 'DVD', 'given', 'credit', 'FAMOUS', 'FLAMES', 'THESE', 'GUYS', 'WERE', 'JUST', 'INDUCTED', 'ROCK', 'AND', 'ROLL', 'HALL', 'OF', 'FAME', 'LET', 'GIVE', 'THEM', 'THEIR', 'PROPS', 'performance', 'was', 'just', 'exciting', 'explosive', 'James', 'Brown', 'was', 'Favorable', 'mention', 'must', 'ALSO', 'be', 'given', 'Motown', 'mighty', 'MIRACLES', 'Smokey', 'Bobby', 'Ronnie', 'Pete', 'Marv', 'guitar', 'who', 'put', 'dynamic', 'perfomance', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'million', 'sellers', ""'ve"", 'Really', 'Got', 'A', 'Hold', 'Me', 'Mickey', 'Monkey', '.BY', 'FAR', 'two', 'BEST', 'groups', 'show', '***UPDATE***', 'CONGRATULATIONS', 'MIRACLES', 'Motown', 'first', 'group', 'Bobby', 'Rogers', 'Ronnie', 'White', 'Pete', 'Moore', 'Marv', 'Tarplin', 'Claudette', 'Robinson', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'had', 'retired', 'live', 'shows', 'earlier', 'year', 'mighty', 'FAMOUS', 'FLAMES', 'Bobby', 'Byrd', 'Bobby', 'Bennett', 'Lloyd', 'Stallworth', 'FINALLY', 'getting', 'inducted', 'THE', 'ROCK', 'AND', 'ROLL', 'HALL', 'OF', 'FAME', '2012', '27', 'years', 'front', 'men', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'James', 'Brown', 'respectively', 'were', 'inducted', 'credit', 'release', 'THE', 'T.A.M.I', 'Show', 'DVD', '2009', 'finally', 'helping', 'people', 'remember', 'Robinson', 'AND', 'Brown', 'ACTUALLY', 'STARTED', 'THEIR', 'RESPECTIVE', 'CAREERS', 'MEMBERS', 'GROUPS', 'not', 'SOLO', 'ARTISTS', 'Miracles', 'Famous', 'Flames', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'inducted', 'lead', 'singers', 'DECADES', 'AGO']",N/A
