The weaknesses were immediately apparent--awkward dialogue, lack of visual style--but I hoped the movie would overcome its faults.  It didn't.  Unlike, for example, Wedding for Bella, which had some similar shortcomings and obvious outcomes, this movie never made me care about the lead characters--they were two-dimensional sketches rather than fleshed-out characters.  I liked Amy Jo Johnson, although being a 30-year-old playing ""the teenager"" suggests a reason for her undistinguished career, and I liked Liz Vassey who was also relaxed in her character rather than awkwardly acting a part.
