What could have been a pretty good storyline deevolved into a mano y mano fight between the two leads. It just did not make sense.Pooor writing plagued the production. Why would Gere's character kill the killer right next to him when he would only have needed to shoot the guy right from his location. That would have made the subsequent flight of the accomplice moot. Any real life cop would have known this.Then there was the love triangle which I felt was overplayed. What did intrigue me was the domestic violence that Garcia exhibited to his wife. Hiting a woman is always looked at negatively in American cinema. Yet Garcia smacks his wife to the floor in front of witnesses. This is a rarity in movies and I liked being surprised by the reality of the scene. By the way, how did Dennis Peck get Avile's panties? That is something that is still on my mind.Peck's character is tough and macho. There is no woman he can't seduce and it is this movie that put me in awe of Richard Gere. I have always been in awe of him since American Gigolo.The movie had good ideas yet it lost its way and could not recover. Arch campbell of Washington, DC hated this film and from the ending I have to say I agree with him. However, the basic premise made sense. A man like Dennis Peck could exist in LA before the advent of ubiquitous video cameras. Dennis Peck is a real life Laurence Powell when it comes to brutality and corruption.Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed. I liked Raymond Aviles's partner, too. My namesake played the role of his partner with aplomb. I'm proud to be the 41st person to rate this DVD.A.

459688,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6305310335,calvinnme,"[5, 15]","After reading all of the other reviews of this film and all of the praise heaped on it, I have to wonder, are we all watching the same movie?  ""Internal Affairs"" is a weird film with so many preposterous premises that it could almost be a dark comedy if it was not for all of the mental and physical cruelty going on. As ridiculous as the plot is, you can see the end, and about everything in between, coming at you a mile away.Raymond Avilla (Andy Garcia) is an officer in the LAPD in the Internal Affairs Division. In one of his first assignments, Garcia and his partner Amy Wallace (Laurie Metcalf) are investigating officer Van Stretch (William Baldwin). Avilla also suspects Stretch's partner, Dennis Peck (Richard Gere), since he finds it hard to believe that Stretch's partner would be blind to his illegal activity. He also believes that Stretch does not have the intelligence or the independence to be pulling off all of the drug dealing on his own.Peck is supporting several ex-wives, his current pregnant wife, and eight children - on a policeman's salary?. He's also sleeping with just about every woman that becomes his target of opportunity, including his own partner's wife. Metcalf's character is the only woman in this film not being sexually targeted and/or abused by Peck. However, this film attributes this more to her sexual orientation than to the possibility that she might actually have standards. Also, Peck is so involved in so many blatant dirty dealings that Frank Drebbin of Police Squad would have had to be chief of Internal Affairs to not notice what's been going on up to this point, especially given Peck's high rolling lifestyle and his harem. Peck is a politician extraordinaire, and his picture should be next to the phrase ""quid pro quo"" in the dictionary. This has kept him out of the line of fire of the other regular cops on the force. Whenever Peck calls in a favor, his cop friends don't seem to mind that the favors often involve felonies.  Peck is also ultra-psychotic and murders his so-called best friend and partner, the unfortunate officer Stretch, to keep him from talking to internal affairs and exposing Peck's comfy criminal arrangements.I have to wonder why such a good actor as Richard Gere would have taken on such a two-dimensional role as Dennis Peck. Peck seems to have taken on the profession of rogue cop more because he enjoys performing acts of violence, murder, and mayhem than the reason that he gives in the film - that he would do anything to support his kids. What does shooting Laurie Metcalf's character with a smile on his face have to do with supporting his kids? What does all of the mental cruelty that he generously portions out and treating every woman that he meets as a piece of meat got to do with supporting his kids?Andy Garcia and Laurie Metcalf seemed rather wooden in their performances. In fact, it seems that only the villains in this film seem to come alive on screen. I get the feeling that all of the lead actors and actresses in this film just did not have proper direction during their performances on top of a script that does not make sense. This film has no brilliant twists, no lessons learned, and no complex characters. The only thing the viewer will get out of this movie is the need to take a long cleansing shower afterwards after having been exposed to the worst behavior humanity has to offer.",2,DId I see the same movie as these other reviewers?,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,3395,"['reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'praise', 'heaped', 'have', 'wonder', 'are', 'watching', 'same', 'movie', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'weird', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'preposterous', 'premises', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'dark', 'comedy', 'was', 'not', 'mental', 'physical', 'cruelty', 'going', 'As', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'can', 'see', 'end', 'everything', 'coming', 'mile', 'away.Raymond', 'Avilla', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'officer', 'LAPD', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'Division', 'one', 'first', 'assignments', 'Garcia', 'partner', 'Amy', 'Wallace', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'are', 'investigating', 'officer', 'Van', 'Stretch', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'Avilla', 'also', 'Stretch', 'partner', 'Dennis', 'Peck', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'hard', 'believe', 'Stretch', 'partner', 'would', 'be', 'blind', 'illegal', 'activity', 'also', 'Stretch', 'not', 'have', 'intelligence', 'independence', 'be', 'pulling', 'drug', 'dealing', 'own.Peck', 'supporting', 'several', 'ex-wives', 'current', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'eight', 'children', 'policeman', 'salary', 'also', 'sleeping', 'just', 'woman', 'target', 'opportunity', 'including', 'own', 'partner', 'wife', 'Metcalf', 'character', 'only', 'woman', 'film', 'not', 'being', 'sexually', 'targeted', 'and/or', 'abused', 'Peck', 'However', 'film', 'more', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'possibility', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'standards', 'Also', 'Peck', 'so', 'involved', 'so', 'many', 'blatant', 'dirty', 'dealings', 'Frank', 'Drebbin', 'Police', 'Squad', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'be', 'chief', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'not', 'notice', 'what', 'been', 'going', 'point', 'especially', 'given', 'Peck', 'high', 'rolling', 'lifestyle', 'harem', 'Peck', 'politician', 'extraordinaire', 'picture', 'should', 'be', 'next', 'phrase', 'quid', 'pro', 'quo', 'dictionary', 'kept', 'line', 'fire', 'other', 'regular', 'cops', 'force', 'Whenever', 'Peck', 'favor', 'cop', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'favors', 'often', 'involve', 'felonies', 'Peck', 'also', 'ultra-psychotic', 'murders', 'so-called', 'best', 'friend', 'partner', 'unfortunate', 'officer', 'Stretch', 'keep', 'talking', 'internal', 'affairs', 'exposing', 'Peck', 'comfy', 'criminal', 'arrangements.I', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'such', 'good', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'such', 'two-dimensional', 'role', 'Dennis', 'Peck', 'Peck', 'have', 'taken', 'profession', 'rogue', 'cop', 'more', 'performing', 'acts', 'violence', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'reason', 'film', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'support', 'kids', 'What', 'shooting', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'character', 'smile', 'face', 'have', 'do', 'supporting', 'kids', 'What', 'mental', 'cruelty', 'generously', 'out', 'treating', 'woman', 'piece', 'meat', 'got', 'do', 'supporting', 'kids', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'seemed', 'rather', 'wooden', 'performances', 'fact', 'only', 'villains', 'film', 'seem', 'come', 'alive', 'screen', 'get', 'feeling', 'lead', 'actors', 'actresses', 'film', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'proper', 'direction', 'performances', 'top', 'script', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'film', 'brilliant', 'twists', 'lessons', 'learned', 'complex', 'characters', 'only', 'thing', 'viewer', 'will', 'get', 'movie', 'need', 'take', 'long', 'cleansing', 'shower', 'afterwards', 'having', 'been', 'exposed', 'worst', 'behavior', 'humanity', 'offer']",N/A

Andy &quot;RAMON&quot; Garcia is hispanic, cold, married to a beautiful member  of the artistic world of L.A. and dedicated to his job. Richard  &quot;DENNIS&quot; Gere, on the contrary, is a cop with no morals at all,  living with his two ex-wives and six children in the same house and  enjoying the fortune he has illegally made during his spare time.You  soon understand that there is a second fight going on, the one Ramon has to  carry on against himself. And the description of Ramon's stress is  curiously the most interesting aspect of INTERNAL AFFAIRS. Dennis will  become the broken mirror into which Ramon looks at himself. The image that  Richard &quot;Dennis&quot; Gere reflects in the direction of Andy Garcia is  vicious ; it's the image of an anglo-american living an hispanic way of  life with his entire family around him. Hard to swallow for a Ramon without  any single child !So Ramon will go through a terrible night during which  all the temptations will pass before his eyes ; jealousy, sex, intemperance  and so on. The high point of this night is reached when he slaps his wife  screaming in his mother tongue, in spanish. At this moment, one understands  that INTERNAL AFFAIRS is also the story of a man who has to kill a part of  himself in order to survive in the world he has chosen to live in.Don't  be afraid ! Mike Figgis' INTERNAL AFFAIRS is in the first place a wonderful  cop movie with Richard Gere in the best role of his career and lot of  action too.

At first glance it seems a good cop bad cop film; however, it seems to me at least to be much more an exploration of evil vs. sterility. Graham Greene's Brighton Rock came to mind. Yes Gere's character Dennis Peck is corrupt murderous and evil but his pursuers are worse--each of them represents a sterile modernity. Garcia and his partner have no children--and that to me is the core of the film--they each are tied into a yuppie culture of malignant exhibitionism (the art gallery is the perfect metaphor) In Brighton Rock Pinkie is as deadly as  Peck but Greene saves his real condemnation for his putatively virtuous pursuer Ida. In some ways this film is even better than Brighton Rock which is saying something since the theme of fertility vs sterility or corruption vs modernity, pregnant throughout the film  is announced powerfully at the end.Greene's great  book  announces its cognate moral anthropology at the start  uses religion as the dominant trope which perhaps is vaguer these days.

Sex played a vital role in the movie, and to me, there was nothing steamy about it.  It just sizzled right out.Gere and Garcia so obviously walked through their parts and they must have needed the money, because they were just jokes.  Garcia was incredibly stiff.  There was no emotion in his character until the end, and even then it was mild.  Gere was awful as the ""villain"".  He's obviously progressed immensely as an actor.The directing was just plain bad.  It seemed the actors didn't know what to do for moments in the movie.
