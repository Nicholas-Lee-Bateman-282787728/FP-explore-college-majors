305489,A22TQMQ4TQGW43,6302281601,Marcco99,"[11, 11]","I can't wait for Columbia/Sony Pictures to release this film on DVD.Rita Hayworth was truly a stunner in every respect, and her studio did their upmost to showcase her beauty and talents as a dancer in film after film. Kudos to them!!! This one is a perfect example of such a Star vehicle. Luscious Technicolor, a number of EXTREME closeups of the creamy Love Goddess herself, a variety of musical numbers, including one sizzling samba with Rita in a white costume that shows a lot of flesh.Watch Rita undulate (dictionary: to move in a smooth wavelike motion--amen!!) as sings ""You Excite Me""!! In this number as well as others Rita shows off her great talent as a dancer, perhaps the best all-around female dancer in Hollywood. She has an unearthly grace that no other dancer has matched.The story takes place in wartime england during the blitz, and ends sadly, which is not typical of a 1940's musical. Still, this is a very entertaining film. MGM may have made the best musicals, but Columbia's Hayworth musicals also have class and a niche of their own in Hollywood history.",5,I MUST HAVE THIS ON DVD!!!!,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,1080,"['ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Columbia/Sony', 'Pictures', 'release', 'film', 'DVD.Rita', 'Hayworth', 'was', 'truly', 'stunner', 'respect', 'studio', 'did', 'upmost', 'showcase', 'beauty', 'talents', 'dancer', 'film', 'film', 'Kudos', 'one', 'perfect', 'example', 'Star', 'vehicle', 'Luscious', 'Technicolor', 'number', 'EXTREME', 'closeups', 'creamy', 'Love', 'Goddess', 'variety', 'musical', 'numbers', 'including', 'one', 'sizzling', 'samba', 'Rita', 'white', 'costume', 'lot', 'flesh.Watch', 'Rita', 'undulate', 'dictionary', 'move', 'smooth', 'wavelike', 'motion', 'amen', 'sings', 'Excite', 'number', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'Rita', 'great', 'talent', 'dancer', 'perhaps', 'best', 'all-around', 'female', 'dancer', 'Hollywood', 'unearthly', 'grace', 'other', 'dancer', 'matched.The', 'story', 'place', 'wartime', 'england', 'blitz', 'sadly', 'not', 'typical', '1940', 'musical', 'Still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'MGM', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'best', 'musicals', 'Columbia', 'Hayworth', 'musicals', 'also', 'have', 'class', 'niche', 'own', 'Hollywood', 'history']",N/A
305490,A1PI4Y53RGQVYB,6302281601,"M. Durham ""andiam""","[8, 9]","His name was Marc Platt, a brilliant dancer who made his movie debut in this film, and I doubt if anybody who ever saw it has forgotten him, though they may not remember his name.Marc Platt was, I think, the first American dancer to join the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlos when it settled in the US during the Second World War. He was a dancer on Broadway, too, and today the movie he's most likely to be remembered for, is SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS, in which he, naturally, is one of the brothers.But in Tonight and Every Night he has a great introduction. He comes as a young dancer to get a job in the theater, run by Florence Bates, who plays a wry version of the same character played recently by Judy Dench. This was the London theater that never closed during the German bombing of the city, which is what the title inicates: Tonight and Every Night.When Bates asks what his 'forte' is, the young red haired dancer says he's just a dancer.  Did he bring his music with him for an audition?  No, but just turn on your radio and I'll dance to whatever comes on.  So, she does, and he does; he dances to several different styles of pop music of the time, a little Latin, a little jitterbug, and then she presses a  button and gets a speech by a screaming Adolph Hitler. After only a seond's hesitation, Plat starts to dance to that, too, and it's one of those moments you know you'll always remember. It's something like the effect when the silver female replica of the heroic heroine in METROPOLIS dances; a stark, high-stepping, robotic march of mania that makes him seem almost mechanical, but beautiful.  Well -- Rita was beautiful.  Marc Platt was electrifying in that otherwise pretty forgetable movie.",3,"There's another person besides Rita, who makes this movie watchable.",1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,1716,"['name', 'was', 'Marc', 'Platt', 'brilliant', 'dancer', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'debut', 'film', 'doubt', 'anybody', 'who', 'ever', 'saw', 'forgotten', 'may', 'not', 'remember', 'name.Marc', 'Platt', 'was', 'think', 'first', 'American', 'dancer', 'join', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'Monte', 'Carlos', 'when', 'settled', 'US', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'was', 'dancer', 'Broadway', 'too', 'today', 'movie', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'remembered', 'SEVEN', 'BRIDES', 'FOR', 'SEVEN', 'BROTHERS', 'naturally', 'one', 'brothers.But', 'Tonight', 'Every', 'Night', 'great', 'introduction', 'young', 'dancer', 'get', 'job', 'theater', 'run', 'Florence', 'Bates', 'who', 'wry', 'version', 'same', 'character', 'played', 'recently', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'was', 'London', 'theater', 'never', 'closed', 'German', 'bombing', 'city', 'what', 'title', 'Tonight', 'Every', 'Night.When', 'Bates', 'what', ""'forte"", 'young', 'red', 'haired', 'dancer', 'just', 'dancer', 'Did', 'bring', 'music', 'audition', 'No', 'just', 'turn', 'radio', ""'ll"", 'dance', 'So', 'several', 'different', 'styles', 'pop', 'music', 'time', 'little', 'Latin', 'little', 'jitterbug', 'then', 'button', 'speech', 'screaming', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'only', 'seond', 'hesitation', 'Plat', 'dance', 'too', 'one', 'moments', 'know', ""'ll"", 'always', 'remember', 'something', 'effect', 'when', 'silver', 'female', 'replica', 'heroic', 'heroine', 'METROPOLIS', 'dances', 'stark', 'high-stepping', 'robotic', 'march', 'mania', 'seem', 'almost', 'mechanical', 'beautiful', 'Well', 'Rita', 'was', 'beautiful', 'Marc', 'Platt', 'was', 'electrifying', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'forgetable', 'movie']",N/A
