Incredibly engaging actioner about a man without faith, a mysterious past, and the ability to give out beat downs that is unparalled, fighting his way out of a post apocolyptic (day of judgment) type landcape against a ruthless biker gang (led by an excellent Brian Bosworth- very solid acting and menace from him).  There is tremendous conflict in the the main characters, and it makes this a really great film.  This is the second faith based film after &#34;Courageous&#34; that I found myself enjoying greatly.A lot of imagery and symbolism about complete loss of faith, redemption, facing your demons, but I did not in the overall find it overly preachy, just provoking and really engaging.

1578996,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B008ZRKIMK,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[0, 1]","First off, I'd like to mention that a part of me was hesitant on seeing this film because of the last film from Pure|Flix I saw, Saving Winston, which ended up being a Christian movie full of Christian tropes and cliches that bored me. Not only that, I'd noticed people on amazon.com hated this movie because of its violence (makes me wonder how they'd react to Jesus when He comes back in full Terminator mode like He's described in the Book of Revelations?)(Possible spoilers ahead)Josh is a travelling salesman on his way back to his wife and daughter and on the phone with her when two strange things happen. One is a bizarre lightning storm. Just lightning. Constant. The other, as he's pulled over when his car dies down, is some guy bumping into his car, then yells at him as if he was the one that ruined his truck. As Josh points out the error of what the guy's saying, things just about get out of control when a bike gang (who, in the initial scene, have already beaten up a federal agent and the leader says something really insightful on how backwards the world is when it comes to who's to fear and who's not) comes by. After the nonviolent skirmish, the bike gang goes off.Josh goes into a convenience store to try another try at selling what he's selling. Then comes straightforward questions from the man he's trying to sell to. Not long after, the salesman who's ""not on speaking terms"" with God protects the store's owner and his granddaughter from 3 of the bike gang. From there, things get intense. And not just the constant lightning storm from nowhere, either.Normally, when it comes to indie-made Christian flicks, I'd get really hesitant on trying them out because of the tendency to have little variety. It was only because the people expressed disdain because of the violence that I decided to try it out. Now I'm glad.You have a trouble-making biker gang, straightforward talk about Jesus (luckily, nothing too cheesy for me to handle and it definitely hit home on a couple points about God's character), and the biker gang is as hardcore as they come (of course, there's no swearing, and in only one instance did the swearless talk come off as slightly cheesy) with their leather getups and crazy helmets. And it turns out the leader has a somewhat ambiguous relationship with one of the women (not sexual, it's hinted they're related, like father-daughter, but his crude talk shows disgust toward her).So, basically, the bikers represent how the world is toward Christians, and accurately as well.The violence is what would make this film PG-13 if it were rated (that and one woman mentioning that she's a drug junkie). A couple shootouts, blood mists sprays, but certainly nothing as extreme as, say, The Book of Eli (there was no dismemberment, full-framed headshots, decapitations, bloody arrow shots, etc. in this movie), but when vioelence happens, it's immediately clear what's going on.And some of the violence is contextually clear as protecting one's family.There are people who've shown how legalistic they are on terms with the objectionable content of this film, but I guess they miss the overall picture with an erroneous reading of the Bible.There are moments when Josh has clear struggles with who he is (though it's never fully explained what his past was like, that's going to be shown in the sequel), and when one woman mocks him and asks ""What? You found Jesus?"" when he explains that he's not who he was, he says a stunner for him and explains about his wife. And the way he talks about her, it's blatantly clear how much he loves her and is not willing to compromise for anything. In that one scene, the woman throws out realistic questions that one really normally wouldn't hear in the world about how nothing in the world can change who someone really is, no matter what. After a brief fight with the woman's friend (couldn't tell if he was her boyfriend or client consider how she hints about herself), he begins to realize something about himself and, while on the phone with his wife, something weird happens.I won't get into what happens, but if you've seen all the other End Times movies, you can figure it out easily.When the store owner's granddaughter manages to escape from the clutches of the biker gang, she runs into an unexpected character (if you've seen The Encounter, you'll recognize him), and he performs one crazy miracle for her to let her know who he is.If there was anything that did annoy me about this film, it would be the lighting effects from the constant lightning strikes, for they were overprocessed to the point of being obviously fake. Some of the script tended to go overboard (though not much) that showed it wasn't a major production.Ocassionally, some stylized shots just seemed to come out nowhere. Most of them helped out with the stylizing of the action, but others simply seemed pointless.Beyond these technical reasonings, I actually enjoyed this movie quite well.Now to wait for the sequel.",4,"Finally, an original end times movie!",1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,4985,"['First', ""'d"", 'like', 'mention', 'part', 'was', 'hesitant', 'seeing', 'film', 'last', 'film', 'Pure|Flix', 'saw', 'Saving', 'Winston', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'Christian', 'movie', 'full', 'Christian', 'tropes', 'cliches', 'bored', 'Not', 'only', ""'d"", 'noticed', 'people', 'amazon.com', 'hated', 'movie', 'violence', 'wonder', 'how', ""'d"", 'react', 'Jesus', 'when', 'back', 'full', 'Terminator', 'mode', 'described', 'Book', 'Revelations', 'Possible', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'Josh', 'travelling', 'salesman', 'way', 'back', 'wife', 'daughter', 'phone', 'when', 'two', 'strange', 'things', 'happen', 'One', 'bizarre', 'lightning', 'storm', 'Just', 'lightning', 'Constant', 'other', 'pulled', 'over', 'when', 'car', 'down', 'guy', 'bumping', 'car', 'then', 'yells', 'was', 'one', 'ruined', 'truck', 'Josh', 'out', 'error', 'what', 'guy', 'saying', 'things', 'just', 'get', 'control', 'when', 'bike', 'gang', 'who', 'initial', 'scene', 'have', 'already', 'beaten', 'up', 'federal', 'agent', 'leader', 'something', 'really', 'insightful', 'how', 'backwards', 'world', 'when', 'who', 'fear', 'who', 'not', 'nonviolent', 'skirmish', 'bike', 'gang', 'off.Josh', 'convenience', 'store', 'try', 'try', 'selling', 'what', 'selling', 'Then', 'straightforward', 'questions', 'man', 'trying', 'sell', 'Not', 'long', 'salesman', 'who', 'not', 'speaking', 'terms', 'God', 'store', 'owner', 'granddaughter', '3', 'bike', 'gang', 'there', 'things', 'get', 'intense', 'not', 'just', 'constant', 'lightning', 'storm', 'nowhere', 'either.Normally', 'when', 'indie-made', 'Christian', 'flicks', ""'d"", 'get', 'really', 'hesitant', 'trying', 'out', 'tendency', 'have', 'little', 'variety', 'was', 'only', 'people', 'expressed', 'disdain', 'violence', 'decided', 'try', 'out', 'Now', ""'m"", 'glad.You', 'have', 'trouble-making', 'biker', 'gang', 'straightforward', 'talk', 'Jesus', 'luckily', 'nothing', 'too', 'cheesy', 'handle', 'definitely', 'hit', 'home', 'couple', 'points', 'God', 'character', 'biker', 'gang', 'as', 'hardcore', 'come', 'course', 'swearing', 'only', 'one', 'instance', 'did', 'swearless', 'talk', 'come', 'off', 'slightly', 'cheesy', 'leather', 'getups', 'crazy', 'helmets', 'out', 'leader', 'somewhat', 'ambiguous', 'relationship', 'one', 'women', 'not', 'sexual', 'hinted', ""'re"", 'related', 'father-daughter', 'crude', 'talk', 'disgust', '.So', 'basically', 'bikers', 'represent', 'how', 'world', 'Christians', 'accurately', 'well.The', 'violence', 'what', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'PG-13', 'were', 'rated', 'one', 'woman', 'mentioning', 'drug', 'junkie', 'couple', 'shootouts', 'blood', 'mists', 'sprays', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'as', 'extreme', 'say', 'Book', 'Eli', 'was', 'dismemberment', 'full-framed', 'headshots', 'decapitations', 'bloody', 'arrow', 'shots', 'etc', 'movie', 'when', 'vioelence', 'immediately', 'clear', 'what', 'going', 'violence', 'contextually', 'clear', 'protecting', 'one', 'are', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'how', 'legalistic', 'are', 'terms', 'objectionable', 'content', 'film', 'guess', 'miss', 'overall', 'picture', 'erroneous', 'reading', 'Bible.There', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'Josh', 'clear', 'struggles', 'who', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'what', 'past', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'shown', 'sequel', 'when', 'one', 'woman', 'What', 'found', 'Jesus', 'when', 'not', 'who', 'was', 'stunner', 'wife', 'way', 'blatantly', 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'not', 'willing', 'compromise', 'anything', 'one', 'scene', 'woman', 'out', 'realistic', 'questions', 'one', 'really', 'normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'hear', 'world', 'how', 'nothing', 'world', 'can', 'change', 'who', 'someone', 'really', 'matter', 'what', 'brief', 'fight', 'woman', 'friend', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'boyfriend', 'client', 'consider', 'how', 'realize', 'something', 'phone', 'wife', 'something', 'weird', 'happens.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'End', 'Times', 'movies', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'store', 'owner', 'granddaughter', 'escape', 'clutches', 'biker', 'gang', 'unexpected', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Encounter', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'one', 'crazy', 'miracle', 'let', 'know', 'who', 'is.If', 'was', 'anything', 'did', 'annoy', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'lighting', 'effects', 'constant', 'lightning', 'strikes', 'were', 'overprocessed', 'point', 'being', 'obviously', 'fake', 'script', 'tended', 'go', 'overboard', 'not', 'much', 'showed', 'was', ""n't"", 'major', 'production.Ocassionally', 'stylized', 'shots', 'just', 'seemed', 'come', 'out', 'nowhere', 'Most', 'helped', 'out', 'stylizing', 'action', 'others', 'simply', 'seemed', 'technical', 'reasonings', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'quite', 'well.Now', 'wait', 'sequel']",Revelation Road

1578998,A3VA7MACQJZPBT,B008ZRKIMK,"Kelly Blackwell - Here's My Take On It ""Kelly""","[42, 44]","Revelation Road: The Beginning of the End is just that, a beginning of at the very least a two-part movie series from Pure Flix Entertainment.  The viewer gets the opportunity to meet Josh, a traveling salesman with a secret but obviously destructive past.  You can see early on that Josh has the capability to go a little unhinged when necessary but you can also see that this is not a side of himself that he entertains.  We also meet a pretty rough biker gang who have a charismatic leader named Hawg.  The gang has no problem with messing with people, stealing and eliminating witnesses, but they do have a problem with Joshua when he gets in their way.You can tell Joshua has a past, but it changed dramatically when he met his wife.  Or at least that is what Josh thought until he sees how easy it really is to slip back into his old skill set.  Can a person really change?  If tackling that question isn't enough for Josh, it seems there are a lot of energy spikes, thunder storms and other natural phenomenon taking place to keep him on his toes and at the very least distracted.  As the description implies, there is an end coming.Revelation Road: The Beginning of the End is a great start.  I found myself wishing for more which is a good thing since there is a sequel on the way (yay!).  I have found myself enjoying most of the films that Pure Flix Entertainment has put out, and look forward to seeing where this will go.

This is rather a pop Christian version designed to sell a film to those who never read and studied the book.Josh (=Jesus) sells vests (=armor of God). He saves a family from a group of evil bikers known as either Outlaws or Barbarians. They have their own heavy metal swagger music, kill people, but never swear. Oh yes, they have something that looks like Thor's hammer. Eric Roberts has a small role in this film. Bruce Marchiano who always plays Jesus in these productions plays a stranger who saves a girl from said bikers. Please Scooby-Doo, tell me who this guy is?This is just the first part of what will surely be a butchered series designed to soak churches for the rights to showing this film. PLOT SPOILER...if there is such a thing...the rapture happens at the end of the film. While the rapture has statements to support it in the Bible, it really isn't part of Revelation. Technically this is a movie about the end times that doesn't follow Revelation in any shape or form, but simply uses it in the title to sell the feature. Dishonest if you ask me.Outside of that, the movie was poorly acted and the dialouge was jerky, like the sign reads, &#34;Guns, Jerky, and More.&#34;Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.
