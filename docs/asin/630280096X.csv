336689,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,630280096X,Acute Observer,"[3, 4]","This is the Hollywood biography of `Buddy Holly', Charles Hardin Holley of Lubbock Texas. The film opens on a roller skating rink in 1956. The band played ""rockabilly"" instead of the usual ""country and western"" music, reflecting the changing tastes. Then Buddy played ""That'll Be the Day"" (based on a character in the film ""The Searchers""). Some complain. There is a funny scene where a minister denounces this music - in 1956. [Bill Haley and his Comets had a national hit in 1954, then came Elvis in 1955.] The radio station owner had to listen to his sponsors; certain sample records could not be played. A talent scout invited them to audition in Nashville. Buddy had arranged his music for a 3-man band, minimizing costs. But this seems novel, and his band did not meet the company's needs.New York is looking for ""new sounds"" that will attract customers. Buddy Holly's ""Crickets"" have that sound. A station in Buffalo NY played their record continuously. Teenagers bought his records for his new sound, a high-energy music that reflected 1950s America. Buddy Holly wanted to be the producer in charge, a change from the usual business practices. [There seems to be some kind of joke about the racial identity of this group, not true at the time.] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Fats Domino appealed to white audiences, a symbol of changing times. But legal actions put an end to some careers, and Elvis was drafted. But the toothpaste was out of the tube and nothing was the same afterwards.The film shows the overdubbing to create an echo effect, first pioneered by Les Paul for vocals [To recreate this for live audiences, another hidden singer was used.] Buddy said goodbye to Peggy Sue and hello to Maria Elena. It shows the Crickets at an Alan Freed ""Rock and Roll"" show in Brooklyn. Eddie Cochrane covered a song by Jerry Lee Lewis. [Eddie Cochrane died young in a 1959 car crash.] But Jesse and Ray Bob long to return to their home in Lubbock, even if they might miss the Ed Sullivan show. Buddy convinces them to stay and perform. After they leave, Buddy keeps his word and lets them keep the ""Crickets"" name.The manager explains the need to personally tour to sell records. A personal appearance sells  more records, customers buy them like souvenirs. It would be a five week Winter Tour of the Mid-West. So the business needs win out. The ending has the show in Clear Lake Iowa. Disk jockey J.P. Richardson talks his famous ""Chantilly Lace"". Buddy sings to an adoring audience. His ""True Love Ways"" used violins and other instruments. Buddy's sudden death in February 1959 shocked teen-age America. Some admirers in England used an insect name for their group, but their talents were greater still.If Buddy had lived, he could be singing today in Branson or Las Vegas. Would he have moved on in the late 1960s, like the Beatles? Or died prematurely by misadventure like Elvis? ""Of all the words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: it might have been.""",5,His Short Brilliant Career,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,2975,"['Hollywood', 'biography', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'Charles', 'Hardin', 'Holley', 'Lubbock', 'Texas', 'film', 'roller', 'skating', 'rink', '1956', 'band', 'played', 'rockabilly', 'instead', 'usual', 'country', 'western', 'music', 'reflecting', 'changing', 'tastes', 'Then', 'Buddy', 'played', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Day', 'based', 'character', 'film', 'Searchers', 'complain', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'minister', 'music', '1956', '[', 'Bill', 'Haley', 'Comets', 'had', 'national', 'hit', '1954', 'then', 'came', 'Elvis', '1955', ']', 'radio', 'station', 'owner', 'had', 'listen', 'sponsors', 'certain', 'sample', 'records', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'played', 'talent', 'scout', 'invited', 'audition', 'Nashville', 'Buddy', 'had', 'arranged', 'music', '3-man', 'band', 'minimizing', 'costs', 'novel', 'band', 'did', 'not', 'meet', 'company', 'needs.New', 'York', 'looking', 'new', 'sounds', 'will', 'attract', 'customers', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'Crickets', 'have', 'sound', 'station', 'Buffalo', 'NY', 'played', 'record', 'continuously', 'Teenagers', 'bought', 'records', 'new', 'sound', 'high-energy', 'music', 'reflected', '1950s', 'America', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'wanted', 'be', 'producer', 'charge', 'change', 'usual', 'business', 'practices', '[', 'be', 'kind', 'joke', 'racial', 'identity', 'group', 'not', 'true', 'time', ']', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Little', 'Richard', 'Fats', 'Domino', 'appealed', 'white', 'audiences', 'symbol', 'changing', 'times', 'legal', 'actions', 'put', 'end', 'careers', 'Elvis', 'was', 'drafted', 'toothpaste', 'was', 'tube', 'nothing', 'was', 'same', 'afterwards.The', 'film', 'overdubbing', 'create', 'echo', 'effect', 'first', 'pioneered', 'Les', 'Paul', 'vocals', '[', 'recreate', 'live', 'audiences', 'hidden', 'singer', 'was', 'used', ']', 'Buddy', 'said', 'goodbye', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'hello', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Crickets', 'Alan', 'Freed', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'show', 'Brooklyn', 'Eddie', 'Cochrane', 'covered', 'song', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', '[', 'Eddie', 'Cochrane', 'died', 'young', '1959', 'car', 'crash', ']', 'Jesse', 'Ray', 'Bob', 'long', 'return', 'home', 'Lubbock', 'even', 'might', 'miss', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'show', 'Buddy', 'stay', 'perform', 'leave', 'Buddy', 'word', 'keep', 'Crickets', 'name.The', 'manager', 'need', 'personally', 'tour', 'sell', 'records', 'personal', 'appearance', 'more', 'records', 'customers', 'buy', 'souvenirs', 'would', 'be', 'five', 'week', 'Winter', 'Tour', 'Mid-West', 'business', 'needs', 'win', 'out', 'ending', 'show', 'Clear', 'Lake', 'Iowa', 'Disk', 'jockey', 'J.P.', 'Richardson', 'famous', 'Chantilly', 'Lace', 'Buddy', 'sings', 'adoring', 'audience', 'True', 'Love', 'Ways', 'used', 'violins', 'other', 'instruments', 'Buddy', 'sudden', 'death', 'February', '1959', 'shocked', 'teen-age', 'America', 'admirers', 'England', 'used', 'insect', 'name', 'group', 'talents', 'were', 'greater', 'still.If', 'Buddy', 'had', 'lived', 'could', 'be', 'singing', 'today', 'Branson', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Would', 'have', 'moved', 'late', '1960s', 'Beatles', 'died', 'prematurely', 'misadventure', 'Elvis', 'words', 'tongue', 'pen', 'saddest', 'are', 'might', 'have', 'been']",N/A
336690,A20HNT8HYIYY0X,630280096X,"Adrian Stranik ""Ade""","[4, 4]","Buddy Holly is a young Texan rock `n' roll singer with bad eyesight and teeth like the grill of a crashed Buick who finds himself at odds with virtually everyone he comes across in his quest for a new sound. His church publicly denounce him, his parents dismiss his music as `kids' stuff, his first recording session becomes a punch up, his fianc&eacute; thinks his music is just a hobby and his band the Crickets are just a couple of `good `ol boys' just out for a good time.In the midst of all this `encouragement' his boss at the local radio station threatens to fire him - but not before sending a recording to some `hut shut pre-dooser up theyer in Noo Yawk'. Within seconds Holly is catapulted to fame, fortune, marriage and death at twenty two - but not before he starts the ball rolling for the civil rights movement, changes the face of popular music and buys a Cadillac.On the face of it Steve Rash's 1978 biopic seems to have gone out of its way to be inaccurate. It manages to render events that kinda/sorta happened into almost total fiction. The insult to Eddie Cochran warrants a governmental inquiry, the concept of a live version of That'll be The Day being his first hit single is wishful thinking in the extreme and don't get me started on the omissions! No mention of the 1958 British tour - an event seismic in its impact on pop music forever afterwards - and no mention of his manger and producer Norman Petty - without whom the world may never have heard of Buddy Holly. They don't even get his guitar right - a Telecaster? A Bronco?! Even in the final scene where he does finally yield a Stratocaster - an instrument integral to the Holly legend - it's a rosewood neck job with a large 70's head and with the tremolo arm left on.For the average viewer this means nothing, but to rock `n' roll aficionados this is the cinematic equivalent of Da Vinci's `The Last Supper' depicted with a family bucket of KFC on the table.Certainly Holly did change the face of popular music and he did buy a Cadillac (or two) but the racial divide smashing is based on his marriage to the Hispanic Maria Elena Santigo and a highly fictionalised account of his appearances at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem where he wins over an initially hostile and exclusively black audience. Here (and in subsequent stage productions) he is booked on the basis that, due to his sound, they thought he was black - then he `blows Negro minds' with his unique blend of rolling drums and jangly guitar after being warned that he would, at best, be killed by an outraged mob who had never witnessed a red neck `hot footing' their hallowed bandstand.The reality is that The Crickets were booked - not because they sounded black - but because there was a Negro vocal group also called the Crickets creating said confusion. They did eventually win over a begrudging audience but it took a week long residency and some Bo Diddley numbers to do it.Some kudos is due as the music is - unlike most musicals - played live and by the actors themselves (with a sneaky second guitar being played off screen - hence cut-aways and long shots during solos). Charles Martin-Smith (Bass) and Don Stroud (Drums) are adequate but everything rests on Gary Busey's singing and guitar playing which, frankly, belongs at chucking out time of a Thai karaoke night. The big final concert at the Clear Lake Auditorium with Coasters saxophonist King Curtis and a full orchestra virtually never happened. The actual show, which was at The Surf Ballroom, was apparently a shoddy affair with standard rock backing (albeit with the brilliant Tommy Allsup on lead guitar and country superstar in the making Waylon Jennings on bass). The stars on that final show ended up having to play drums for each other on account of the hired drummer recovering in hospital from frostbite due to the horrendous travelling conditions.In all fairness many of the inaccuracies were due to litigation considerations as virtually everyone connected to the subject refused to allow themselves to be portrayed or even have their names used - so it's something of a stroke of genius that The Buddy Holly Story takes those limitations and turns them into something of a virtue - resulting in an enjoyable film which is more of an affectionate tribute to notoriously fanciful 50's `candy coloured' biopics such as the Glenn Miller Story than a faithful rendering of the tragically short life a remarkable pioneer.The Buddy Holly Story?

Many complaints about this movie deal with the fact that there are many inaccuracies about Holly's life.  Maybe so, but Gary Busey (in a well deserved Oscar Nominated role) captures the essence of Holly so effectively, it doesn't matter!!!!!  Kudos also to Don Stroud and the marvelous Charles Martin Smith who portray the Crickets with equal finesse.  So their names were changed for the movie from Jerry Allison and Joe Mauldin!  Big Deal!  As for the fact that Holly's parents sued the producers of the movie for inaccurately portraying them is absurd as well.  Heck, they weren't on the screen more than 3 minutes...first in the church scene, then the Sunday dinner scene!  How could one capture accuracy in 3 minutes??  Did this take away from Holly's legend?  I DON'T THINK SO.  Did it take away from his genius??  Never!!  The music score (which won an Oscar) is outstanding and Busey really SHOULD HAVE WON over Jon Voight in Coming HOme, for his portrayal of Holly.  Even HOlly's parents endorsed Busey's portrayal saying Busey captured Holly to a tee!  Busey is amazing!  The lovely actress who played his wife Maria Elena is incandescent.  There is not one single flaw in this film!!  It is an extraordinarily done biography which would have made Holly proud!!  As I said before, the inaccuracies mentioned have not taken away one iota from the Holly mythos.  Best Scene:  Holly performing ""True Love Ways"" at the final concert; truly a heartbreaking moment!  There is a dandy documentary on the making of the film with Busey and the film's director!  There are trailers and subtitles as well.

Likewise with Buddy Holly. The liberties taken with the Texas rock pioneer's actual story may have made for audience-gripping moviemaking, but history has its claims as well - and there was no need whatsoever to gussy up the Holly story, unless someone figured that because he was one of the few early rock stars who could claim a background of reasonable stability and, for the most part, parental support and empathy, Buddy Holly as a film subject would have been as boring as Buddy Holly the musician was exciting.But there remains one reason to indulge &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot; after just over two decades - Gary Busey's performance as the long tall Texan with the thick-rimmed glasses, the toothy smile, and the deceptively gripping songs and rippling guitar style remains one of the most unpretentiously electrifying you will ever see given of an actual music star. Busey made a very credible Holly, both when cranking out his versions of Holly's signature music and in portraying the shyly confident young man offstage, and it remains the most earnest and thorough performance of Busey's career; it garnered him an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor and he deserved the nomination. He played every facet of Holly - the musical confidence, the unprejudiced amiability, the striking romantic (slightly twisted though the scripting is, it is nevertheless true that Buddy Holly really did ask his girl friend's aunt, who'd raised her, for her hand in marriage), the enthusiastic performer - with a surety and a thoroughness he's been hard pressed ever since to equal.Holly himself might have been spinning in his grave over the telling of the story - and it only begins with the point that even the uninitiated knew (and know) that the Crickets were a quarter for most of the time they worked with Holly. But Holly might yet have said of Busey that he'd done him justice in spite of what he had to work with, even if he'd wished Busey could have delivered that justice in a more appropriate presentation.",2,"Busey's A Marvel, But History Also Has Its Claims",997660800,"08 13, 2001",2001,2334,"['become', 'accustomed', 'Hollywood', 'taking', 'too', 'many', 'liberties', 'actual', 'stories', 'famed', 'infamous', 'alike', 'music', 'could', 'ask', 'Glenn', 'Miller', 'Benny', 'Goodman', 'Dorsey', 'brothers', 'whom', 'had', 'life', 'stories', 'sentimentalised', 'bowdlerised', 'quick', 'once', 'Hollywood', 'got', 'mitts', 'Likewise', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'liberties', 'taken', 'Texas', 'rock', 'pioneer', 'actual', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'audience-gripping', 'moviemaking', 'history', 'claims', 'well', 'was', 'need', 'whatsoever', 'gussy', 'up', 'Holly', 'story', 'someone', 'figured', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'early', 'rock', 'stars', 'who', 'could', 'claim', 'background', 'reasonable', 'stability', 'most', 'part', 'parental', 'support', 'empathy', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'film', 'subject', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'boring', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'musician', 'was', 'exciting.But', 'there', 'one', 'reason', 'indulge', 'quot', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'Story', 'quot', 'just', 'two', 'decades', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'performance', 'long', 'tall', 'Texan', 'thick-rimmed', 'glasses', 'toothy', 'smile', 'deceptively', 'gripping', 'songs', 'rippling', 'guitar', 'style', 'one', 'most', 'unpretentiously', 'electrifying', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'given', 'actual', 'music', 'star', 'Busey', 'made', 'very', 'credible', 'Holly', 'when', 'cranking', 'out', 'versions', 'Holly', 'signature', 'music', 'portraying', 'shyly', 'confident', 'young', 'man', 'offstage', 'most', 'earnest', 'thorough', 'performance', 'Busey', 'career', 'garnered', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actor', 'deserved', 'nomination', 'played', 'facet', 'Holly', 'musical', 'confidence', 'unprejudiced', 'amiability', 'striking', 'romantic', 'slightly', 'twisted', 'scripting', 'nevertheless', 'true', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'really', 'did', 'ask', 'girl', 'friend', 'aunt', 'who', ""'d"", 'raised', 'hand', 'marriage', 'enthusiastic', 'performer', 'surety', 'thoroughness', 'been', 'hard', 'pressed', 'ever', 'equal.Holly', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'spinning', 'grave', 'telling', 'story', 'only', 'point', 'even', 'uninitiated', 'knew', 'know', 'Crickets', 'were', 'quarter', 'most', 'time', 'worked', 'Holly', 'Holly', 'might', 'yet', 'have', 'said', 'Busey', ""'d"", 'done', 'justice', 'spite', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'even', ""'d"", 'wished', 'Busey', 'could', 'have', 'delivered', 'justice', 'more', 'appropriate', 'presentation']",N/A

Certainly it takes a few romantic liberties, but do you want a story or a documentary?  Busey should have won the Oscar (he was nominated) for his poignant portrayal of the good, honest southwestern rocker.  It covers the early redneck prejudices of rock and roll, the struggles to the top, the fresh new excitement of a budding American art form. The entire music business as it seemed around 1957-59.  I was 12 to 14 years old around that time and the feeling is right on the mark.  The most important thing is the music.  The film has a surreal atmosphere about it that will leave you emotionally drained  and a bit sad when its over. His early Decca releases in 1956, however aren't as bad as the movie portrays.

Busey's acting is so great you think he's Buddy Holly and isn't crazy. This movie's kind of a comedy at 1st cause of the funny voices and then tragic later but I won't reveal why cause I don't want to spoil it like somebody spoiled it for me. This movie also puts to rest the concept that Buddy Holly faked his death along with LaBomba and the Big Dipper. Just because they never found his plane in the bermuda Triangle doesn't mean he's still alive. (For instance I could get killed by somebody and never found and it wouldn't mean I was alive.)The music on the soundtrack is mostly by the crickets and I heard that was because a lawsuit wouldn't let them use Buddy Holly's music so they used the crickets isntead who did a great job and I like their music just as good as what I've heard Buddy Holly play. There was 1 part that bugged me (thats not a pun on the name crickets) and thats when they pretended black people in this 1 concert didn't know Buddy Holly was white. I thought that was racist but I guess times were different in the 1950s when this movie was made and people looked more alike then. All in all this is about the best biography film ever recorded and as far as rock and roll movies go its about the 5th best behind the wall, rock star, hard days night and crossroads.

This is by far his best performance, &amp; I feel he deserved the best actor oscar more than Jon Voight (who won for Coming Home). Few people know that Busey was a musician before he was an actor, so in this awesome musical biography of Buddy Holly we get to see just how talented he is. The film is mostly factual, although some screen characters are actually composites of two or more people. The energy in Busey's performance is what makes this a winner. Not only did he sing, he did it while being filmed live! That's what gives this such a realistic look to it &amp; it's why this stands out among the other musical biographies as one of the best. There was also a lot of unscripted dialogue that makes this even more entertaining. The best thing about the dvd is the hilarious &amp; very informative commentary from the director Steve Rash &amp; Gary Busey, which is almost as good as the film itself!

The most glaring innacuracy is the names of the other Crickets, Jerry Allison and Joe Mauldin, being changed.  That quibble aside, this film is simultaneously important, yet thrilling, because it celebrates the artistry of rock's premiere pioneer(sorry, Elvis).  Gary Busey doesn't merely portray Buddy Holly, he is possessed by the spirit of the man.  Though he doesn't necessarily duplicate the vocals of Holly, he has the essence of them down pat.  Credit too has to go to Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith as the other Crickets.  This trio actually feels like a working band.  I read some of the other reviews that take issue with the film for it's inaccuracies.  The truth of the matter is alot of the fabrications in the film were the result of legal wrangling and not a deliberate attempt to falsify the facts.  The most important thing here is the film celebrates the man, his creative processes, and the music.  If this film moves the uninitiated they can seek out the true story.  In conclusion,""Hail! Hail!

What has been created is a film which gives the feel and atmosphere of Buddy Holly, his music and the USA of the day. To have been completely factual would have most probably killed the film with legal challenges and suppression. The Crickets leaving Buddy to side with Norman Petty in the split leading to the final tour and the bitter disappointment this must have caused Buddy, the actual split itself with Petty and the resultant financial complications, these happenings are really not the sort of thing to air in a movie to celebrate the life and music of one of the founders of Rock.Instead Gary Busey has strapped on a Fender and in effect becomes Buddy Holly. The rhythm and beat, the frantic excitement, the sheer enjoyment of the music, it is all there. We actually get to experience a timeslice of a period some of us recall fondly and others would like to share. A wonderful reminder of good music for us oldies or a enjoyable introduction to a legend for others, a Rock'n'Roll legend quoted by The Beatles and a number of other major musical identities as a major influence in their music.One of the lesser known items about this film and the making thereof is that Gary Busey actually formed a band and toured up and down the west coast of the USA before the making of it to provide himself with the feel and practice of performing Buddy Holly songs before an audience.

To seal the deal, Busey lost about 30 pounds to more closely resemble him. His Texas twang matched that of fellow Texan Holly and perfectly copied mannerisms earned him an Oscar nomination.

At one point Holly & The Crickets are invited to perform at the Apollo Theater in New York, an all black entertainment format. The promoter only heard the music and assumed they were black. He was a big hit. Lots of fun and good music from the 50's. The film dwells on Holly's life, only briefly referring to the plane crash at the end. Holly has been called 'the single most influential creative force in rock and roll music', influencing the music of the Beatles, Beach Boys, Bob Dylan and other.

The Hollys did not sue about accuracy, they sued about inaccuracy. If you nurture your child's musical gifts from the earliest age, encourage him to perform before audiences, and instill him with confidence in his creative ability, and then see yourselves portrayed as cliche farm folk who tell their son to give up music and concentrate on a ""real career,"" soley for purpose of telling a cliche rock 'n' roll story, I can imagine them being pretty annoyed. The Crickets were annoyed, too, at the portrait of Buddy Holly assaulting a record producer. This never happened and if it had, Buddy Holly would probably have gone to jail and would possibly never have recorded. This movie is loaded with silly high-drama moments and cliched portrayals. The true story was interesting enough, but these producers had to weave in every old angle from Judy Garland movies, to what end I really don't know. Gary Busey brings a lot of energy to the role, it's true. In singing and performing all the songs he does a creditable job. At the same time, on not one song does he get the lyrics right. These are not hard lyrics. I guess there must have been some copyright issue because the lyrics to every single song are changed from the original. I found ""The Buddy Holly Story"" depressing. I expected so much and it delivered so little. Compared to ""La Bamba,"" ""Backbeat,"" or ""Ray"" this is a terrible film bio.

The ""British Invasion"" of USA in the 1960's had a lot to do with Holly and the Crickets.Even today, when the Crickets come over (yes, they are still going, Sony, J B and Jerry!), they play to to sold-out concerts up and down UK.Paul McCartney admits that the Beatles name and style of writing and singing were inspired by Buddy Holly and then by Sony Curtis, Jerry Allison and J B Mauldlin's Crickets.

Wood ""Author and Sports Journalist""","[1, 1]","Despite that a lot of factual information was omitted from this portrait of Buddy Holly, this movie is a compelling, insightful portrait of the mesmerizing character of Buddy Holly himself. Sure, there are glaring omissions concerning the real Crickets and Norm Petty, the 'manager' that helped Buddy get his start--nevertheless, the portrait Gary Busey paints of Buddy is a fascinating, driving and complex picture of an immensely talented, driven, and totally amazing young man who had an unerring faith in his own ability and unsurpassed talent and conviction that he understood and heralded what would become known as rock and roll....the faults in this movie can be overlooked--it is easy enough to find the truth in the in depth biographies of Buddy Holly available. It is far harder to find that fascinating grain of persona and truth that this portrait provides; that is what makes the errors/omissions forgivable. Gary Busey's performance as Buddy garnered him an Academy Award nomination--and provided millions of new fans a look at the driven, multi-faceted, extremely talented and amazing young rocker, Charles Hardin 'Buddy' Holly.This movie is a triumph. The essence of Buddy Holly is portrayed in a magnetic, unsurpassed depiction. The ultimate portrait is a compelling, fascinating look at a young man whose life ended far too soon--and whose talent, foresight and legend created rock music as we knew it in the late 1950's and as we know it today.",5,"Compelling, Fascinating Portrait of Buddy Holly",1223769600,"10 12, 2008",2008,1464,"['lot', 'factual', 'information', 'was', 'omitted', 'portrait', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'movie', 'compelling', 'insightful', 'portrait', 'mesmerizing', 'character', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'Sure', 'are', 'glaring', 'omissions', 'concerning', 'real', 'Crickets', 'Norm', 'Petty', ""'manager"", 'helped', 'Buddy', 'get', 'start', 'nevertheless', 'portrait', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'paints', 'Buddy', 'fascinating', 'driving', 'complex', 'picture', 'immensely', 'talented', 'driven', 'totally', 'amazing', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'unerring', 'faith', 'own', 'ability', 'unsurpassed', 'talent', 'conviction', 'understood', 'heralded', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'known', 'rock', 'roll', '.the', 'faults', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'easy', 'enough', 'find', 'truth', 'depth', 'biographies', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'available', 'far', 'harder', 'find', 'fascinating', 'grain', 'persona', 'truth', 'portrait', 'errors/omissions', 'forgivable', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'performance', 'Buddy', 'garnered', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'provided', 'millions', 'new', 'fans', 'look', 'driven', 'multi-faceted', 'extremely', 'talented', 'amazing', 'young', 'rocker', 'Charles', 'Hardin', ""'Buddy"", 'Holly.This', 'movie', 'triumph', 'essence', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'portrayed', 'magnetic', 'unsurpassed', 'depiction', 'ultimate', 'portrait', 'compelling', 'fascinating', 'look', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'ended', 'far', 'too', 'soon', 'talent', 'foresight', 'legend', 'created', 'rock', 'music', 'knew', 'late', '1950', 'know', 'today']",N/A
