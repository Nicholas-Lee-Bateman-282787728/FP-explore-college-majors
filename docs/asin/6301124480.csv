This movie takes place out in the middle of nowhere, where a girl is kidnapped and the local sheriff out looking for her stumbles upon a town that is inhabited by ghosts. The leader of the ghosts, Devilin, rules the town with an iron fist and only can the sherrif defeat him and save the day. The one thing that this film has that so many other Empire films don't have is the feeling of a piece of quality work being done. The actors are first rate and so are the sets and special effects, but extra recognition must go to Mac Ahlberg for his visually stunning photography. He is definitly one of the best in the business and deserves more exposure. The direction by Richard Govenor is also first rate and once again, this is a quality film. Highly recommended and I believe that this film would make a great double feature with prison.Trivia:Richard Govenor is a Australian and this was the first film he directed.The soundtrack consists of other pieces of music taken from other Empire picture films.Jimmy F. Skaggs appeared soon after this movie in Full Moons first picture Puppetmaster.",4,A lost Treasure,1063584000,"09 15, 2003",2003,1268,"['Ghost', 'Town', 'Prison', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'films', 'produced', 'Empire', 'Entertainment', 'films', 'most', 'Empires', 'previous', 'films', 'were', 'created', 'sense', 'quality', 'movie', 'place', 'out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'where', 'girl', 'kidnapped', 'local', 'sheriff', 'out', 'looking', 'stumbles', 'town', 'inhabited', 'ghosts', 'leader', 'ghosts', 'Devilin', 'rules', 'town', 'iron', 'fist', 'only', 'can', 'sherrif', 'defeat', 'save', 'day', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Empire', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'feeling', 'piece', 'quality', 'work', 'being', 'done', 'actors', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'so', 'are', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'extra', 'recognition', 'must', 'go', 'Mac', 'Ahlberg', 'visually', 'stunning', 'photography', 'definitly', 'one', 'best', 'business', 'more', 'exposure', 'direction', 'Richard', 'Govenor', 'also', 'first', 'rate', 'once', 'again', 'quality', 'film', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'believe', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'double', 'feature', 'prison.Trivia', 'Richard', 'Govenor', 'Australian', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'consists', 'other', 'pieces', 'music', 'taken', 'other', 'Empire', 'picture', 'films.Jimmy', 'F.', 'Skaggs', 'appeared', 'soon', 'movie', 'Full', 'Moons', 'first', 'picture', 'Puppetmaster']",N/A

A sheriff and deputy come to check it out and the deputy is left behind to investigate. He follows a mysterious trail of horse shoe prints and finds his way into a ghost town and attempts to figure out where the girl is and how to save her if need be.There' more to it then that, but that's the basic gist of the plot.Atmosphere: The atmosphere is good. I had a sort of feeling of dread from the beginning to end of the movie, especially when the villain was on screen.Acting: Very good for the budget this film had. The film seems fairly low-budget, but the acting is great!  While cheesy in parts, I didn't feel it was forced and I was carried away by the film.Special FX and Make-up: Good, very good I was impressed, love the makeup effects on the main villain.Overall: I was very much impressed. With the exception of a couple cheesy moments, it was great horror/fantasy film.  Its end wasn't exactly wrapped up in a neat little package either like you'd expect from a low budget film such as this.  Even if this wasn't great, it by and far exceeded my expectations, which were extraordinarily low and high at the same time. I would have liked it to be a little longer though, its a little over 80mins.If you're looking for a decent horror film from the 80's or just a decent horror film in general that is not just a bunch of gore and murders, check out ""Ghost Town""  if you can find a copy of it, if you do, don't pass it up! :DThey should put it on DVD or Blu Ray, or instant video, seriously!!!! :(God Bless ~Amy",5,Top-notch horror fantasy,1066435200,"10 18, 2003",2003,1636,"['Plot', 'woman', 'driving', 'down', 'road', 'car', 'out', 'then', 'sand', 'storm', 'randomly', 'sheriff', 'deputy', 'come', 'check', 'out', 'deputy', 'left', 'investigate', 'mysterious', 'trail', 'horse', 'shoe', 'prints', 'way', 'ghost', 'town', 'attempts', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'girl', 'how', 'save', 'need', 'more', 'then', 'basic', 'gist', 'plot.Atmosphere', 'atmosphere', 'good', 'had', 'sort', 'feeling', 'dread', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'especially', 'when', 'villain', 'was', 'screen.Acting', 'Very', 'good', 'budget', 'film', 'had', 'film', 'fairly', 'low-budget', 'acting', 'great', 'cheesy', 'parts', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'forced', 'was', 'carried', 'away', 'film.Special', 'FX', 'Make-up', 'Good', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'impressed', 'love', 'makeup', 'effects', 'main', 'villain.Overall', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'impressed', 'exception', 'couple', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'was', 'great', 'horror/fantasy', 'film', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'wrapped', 'up', 'neat', 'little', 'package', ""'d"", 'expect', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'such', 'Even', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'far', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'were', 'extraordinarily', 'low', 'high', 'same', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'be', 'little', 'longer', 'little', '80mins.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'decent', 'horror', 'film', '80', 'just', 'decent', 'horror', 'film', 'general', 'not', 'just', 'bunch', 'gore', 'murders', 'check', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'can', 'find', 'copy', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'DThey', 'should', 'put', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'instant', 'video', 'seriously', 'God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

This movie, though low budget, kept my attention and entertained me. Of course I bought the vhs when it was released and watched it numerous times. They really need to put this one on dvd. It is a little known but very good movie. Jimmy F. Skaggs (Who died of lung cancer in 2004) played an excellent ghostly villian in this film and made the movie all the more creepy with that evil smile of his.

245549,A3R4ACE1R3LOBW,6301124480,Skippy Johnson,"[1, 13]",Ghost Town is a real miserable horror movie with some truly horrible acting and cheap production values that this movie has some decent special effects. A man is lost in a town that is haunted and must battle a ghost that is a cowboy and then must battle his evil memebers. The good part comes from when the ghost cowboy gets shot in the cheek and blood shoots out.
