It is fun, has twists and turns in the plot, and will make you laugh.  James Stewart certainly played a different role than usual, but he did a good job at it (of course, I've never seen a movie with him in it that I didn't like).  It's a good, clean, old-fashioned movie with romance, intrigue, and a bit of tension.  Really it's a fun adventure the whole family could enjoy without having to fast-foward or cover your kids' eyes or ears, unlike a lot of movies nowadays.When James Stewart's character promises to clear a soft-of friend's name by looking for a murderer, he has no idea what he's getting into.  He certainly doesn't want Claudett's character tagging along, but she can't seem to help it--she likes James and she likes the thrill of danger.  She ends up helping him out of a tough spot on more than one occasion, including one moment when he's just stepped off the ferry, thinking he's rid of her and one step closer to finding a clue about the murderer, when the police, who are hot on his trail for hiding their suspect, show up.  Luckily he's disguised in a scout uniform and thick glasses, but they still want to question him about the guy they're chasing.  Claudett shows up at the same time and cleverly spins a tale about her eloping with him, an English actor.  And that's just a taste of the treat you're in for if you watch It's a Wonderful World.  I highly recommend this movie!",4,Fun movie,1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,1502,"[""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'came', 'Amazon', 'rental', 'was', 'impressed', 'fun', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'James', 'Stewart', 'certainly', 'played', 'different', 'role', 'usual', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'course', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'good', 'clean', 'old-fashioned', 'movie', 'romance', 'intrigue', 'bit', 'tension', 'Really', 'fun', 'adventure', 'whole', 'family', 'could', 'enjoy', 'having', 'fast-foward', 'cover', 'kids', 'eyes', 'ears', 'lot', 'movies', 'nowadays.When', 'James', 'Stewart', 'character', 'clear', 'soft-of', 'friend', 'name', 'looking', 'murderer', 'idea', 'what', 'getting', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'want', 'Claudett', 'character', 'tagging', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'help', 'James', 'thrill', 'danger', 'up', 'helping', 'tough', 'spot', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'including', 'one', 'moment', 'when', 'just', 'stepped', 'off', 'ferry', 'thinking', 'rid', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'finding', 'clue', 'murderer', 'when', 'police', 'who', 'are', 'hot', 'trail', 'hiding', 'suspect', 'show', 'up', 'Luckily', 'disguised', 'scout', 'uniform', 'thick', 'glasses', 'still', 'want', 'question', 'guy', ""'re"", 'chasing', 'Claudett', 'up', 'same', 'time', 'cleverly', 'tale', 'eloping', 'English', 'actor', 'just', 'taste', 'treat', ""'re"", 'watch', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",It's a Wonderful World

She was both a sure-thing box office hit and a highly respected professional. She was versatile: comedy or drama, she could do it all. Steward was acquiring versatility: he had featured with tough guy, Edward G. Robinson, and done comedy (and even a song) in a film with Eleanor Powell. He was fast moving into stardom,Both show their comedy side in this dizzy dazzler, with Stewart as a private detective, on the way to Sing Sing (although it doesn't say so), who would do anything for a buck (or, as in this case, 100,000 bucks--more than a million in today's coin of the realm). Not to reveal any more than necessary, his path crosses with a daffy poetess, who becomes attached to him. The plot line: how is he to clear himself, while saving his client from THE (electric) CHAIR. Edgar Kennedy and Guy Kibbee are excellent in their patented comedic roles and Nat Pendleton is the epitome of the Dumb Cop. In a brief appearance, the virtuoso of innumerable radio roles (and later a frequent guest on the Jack Paar Show), Hans Conreid, is recognizable.Most of the comedy is anything but subtle. Physical gags and outrageous mugging are the norm. So, too, are the expert comedic way with lines of both stars.I wouldn't call this a classic film, if only because it does almost anything for a laugh.

874749,A1S1JC7LTBZAH2,B0006V8PXC,Hal Jordan,"[14, 17]","It was hard to believe I had never seen this film before.  In fact, I had never even heard of it.  Jimmy Stewart, Claudette Colbert, a script by Ben Hecht?  Leonard Maltin describes it as ""very, very funny.""  I figured I was in for a real treat.  Unfortunately, it turned out that there were good reasons for this being a rather obscure film -- it's just not very good.  The main problem is the script.  The idea is pretty good:  Stewart plays a private detective who gets arrested while trying to clear a millionaire client of murder.  He escapes and has various adventures with Colbert while on the run.  Unfortunately, it's just not very funny (I don't know what Maltin was thinking).  There is an over reliance on slapstick and physical humor -- Stewart wearing as a disguise glasses that he can't actually see through, his partner repeatedly getting hit on the head, and so on.  Anyone looking for snappy dialog from Ben Hecht won't find it here.  Much as I love Jimmy Stewart, his performances could sometimes edge into the shrill.  That happens a number of times in this one, perhaps because he is trying to use the energy of his delivery to compensate for the weakness of some of the dialog.If you are a 1930s movie buff, this one is worth seeing, but I give a disappointing 2 1/2 stars.",3,"Worth a look, but should have been much better",1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,1295,"['was', 'hard', 'believe', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'before', 'fact', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'script', 'Ben', 'Hecht', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'figured', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'Unfortunately', 'turned', 'out', 'were', 'good', 'reasons', 'being', 'rather', 'obscure', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'main', 'problem', 'script', 'idea', 'pretty', 'good', 'Stewart', 'private', 'detective', 'who', 'arrested', 'trying', 'clear', 'millionaire', 'client', 'murder', 'various', 'adventures', 'Colbert', 'run', 'Unfortunately', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Maltin', 'was', 'thinking', 'over', 'reliance', 'slapstick', 'physical', 'humor', 'Stewart', 'wearing', 'disguise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actually', 'see', 'partner', 'repeatedly', 'getting', 'hit', 'head', 'so', 'Anyone', 'looking', 'snappy', 'dialog', 'Ben', 'Hecht', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'Much', 'love', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'performances', 'could', 'sometimes', 'edge', 'shrill', 'number', 'times', 'one', 'perhaps', 'trying', 'use', 'energy', 'delivery', 'compensate', 'weakness', 'dialog.If', 'are', '1930s', 'movie', 'buff', 'one', 'worth', 'seeing', 'give', 'disappointing', '2', '1/2', 'stars']",It's a Wonderful World

So, here's Jimmy Stewart, hiding out in a regional theatre production of ""What Price Glory,"" with the characters, during the course of the play, rubbing dirt on their faces to camouflage themselves in war. He's confronted by police officers who are looking for him, and he, there in a kind of ""blackface,"" starts speaking what apparently passed for ebonics in 1939. Someone else mentions going to Harlem and another person says something substantially to the effect that they'll have to put their blackface on. Jimmy Stewart punches Claudette Colbert.  So all that's gruesome, but also there's Claudette Colbert at age 36, looking a bit matronly, and the storyline shamelessly stealing from ""It Happened One Night"" (but Jimmy Stewart is a DETECTIVE, not a journalist, see?).
