472535,A200C7YQJ45LRR,6305668426,"Anthony Rupert ""shut up, Shut Up, SHUT UP!!!""","[3, 6]","The Wood was undoubtedly a comeback for MTV Films. (Do you know anybody who saw Joe's Apartment?) It's the story of three men: Roland (Taye Diggs), Slim (Richard T. Jones) and Mike (Omar Epps), who have been friends since youth. At one point Roland, who never considered settling down EVER, had planned to marry his girlfriend, but on the big day he is nowhere to be found. As Mike and Slim search for him, they reminisce on the day they first met. Roland and Slim had already known each other, and Mike was the new guy at school. In order to fit in, he would do basically anything Roland and Slim told him, including going after Alicia, the best-looking girl in school. After going the wrong way in doing that, Alicia's gangbanging brother Stacey goes after him, but that subsides, and for some reason Mike and Alicia become friends.Back in the present, Mike and Slim finally track down Roland, who has such cold feet that he is now drunk out of his mind. After he gets cleaned up, the three of them go shopping, which spurs another memory: when they were at the school dance. Roland and Slim made up a contest for who could get the most girls' phone numbers. Mike went along with it unenthusiastically, for the only girl he was interested in was Alicia. He did end up getting her number, and her number alone. Although Roland and Slim ended up getting several girls' numbers, they both agreed that Mike's one number was bigger than all their numbers combined.Later on they hold another contest...for who can lose their virginity first. Roland and Slim lost theirs with no trouble. Mike lost his as well, to Alicia, but he didn't tell them about it because he decided it was more important than a contest.This movie was good, but there were a few things wrong with it. Roland was the former womanizer, and Roland was the guy getting married. So why did all the flashbacks revolve around Mike? Also, we know Roland was drunk, but the regurgitation scene was a little too graphic. He was throwing up nonstop for a full minute. Still, this is one of the better black movies I've seen. Just don't compare it to Soul Food or Love &amp; Basketball.",3,(3-1/2 stars) I tried to like this more,1020384000,"05 3, 2002",2002,2143,"['Wood', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'comeback', 'MTV', 'Films', 'Do', 'know', 'anybody', 'who', 'saw', 'Joe', 'Apartment', 'story', 'three', 'men', 'Roland', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'Slim', 'Richard', 'T.', 'Jones', 'Mike', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'youth', 'one', 'point', 'Roland', 'who', 'never', 'considered', 'settling', 'down', 'EVER', 'had', 'planned', 'marry', 'girlfriend', 'big', 'day', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Mike', 'Slim', 'search', 'reminisce', 'day', 'first', 'met', 'Roland', 'Slim', 'had', 'already', 'known', 'other', 'Mike', 'was', 'new', 'guy', 'school', 'order', 'fit', 'would', 'do', 'basically', 'anything', 'Roland', 'Slim', 'told', 'including', 'going', 'Alicia', 'best-looking', 'girl', 'school', 'going', 'wrong', 'way', 'doing', 'Alicia', 'gangbanging', 'brother', 'Stacey', 'reason', 'Mike', 'Alicia', 'become', 'friends.Back', 'present', 'Mike', 'Slim', 'finally', 'track', 'down', 'Roland', 'who', 'such', 'cold', 'feet', 'now', 'mind', 'cleaned', 'up', 'three', 'go', 'shopping', 'memory', 'when', 'were', 'school', 'dance', 'Roland', 'Slim', 'made', 'up', 'contest', 'who', 'could', 'get', 'most', 'girls', 'phone', 'numbers', 'Mike', 'went', 'unenthusiastically', 'only', 'girl', 'was', 'interested', 'was', 'Alicia', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'number', 'number', 'alone', 'Roland', 'Slim', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'several', 'girls', 'numbers', 'agreed', 'Mike', 'one', 'number', 'was', 'bigger', 'numbers', 'combined.Later', 'hold', 'contest', 'who', 'can', 'lose', 'virginity', 'first', 'Roland', 'Slim', 'lost', 'trouble', 'Mike', 'lost', 'well', 'Alicia', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'decided', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'contest.This', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'wrong', 'Roland', 'was', 'former', 'womanizer', 'Roland', 'was', 'guy', 'getting', 'married', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'flashbacks', 'revolve', 'Mike', 'Also', 'know', 'Roland', 'was', 'drunk', 'regurgitation', 'scene', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'graphic', 'was', 'throwing', 'up', 'nonstop', 'full', 'minute', 'Still', 'one', 'better', 'black', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'Soul', 'Food', 'Love', 'amp', 'Basketball']",The Wood VHS

It takes you back to the  moments you spent being one or all of hte characters represented growing  up.  It takes you back to the wretched, laughable moments of puberty where  the changes in your body- in your head if nothing else- changed the shape  of your life and the status- and amount- of your friends.  And it takes you  forward into the realization that those moments of insecurity and epiphany  that are the hallmarks of your youth follow you right into the major life  changes of your adulthood.I personally would have liked it more if there  was another sub-plot to compliment the one of Taye Diggs' character coming  to terms with his adult choice and love decision- mariage- and the fear it  inevitably brings up. Something like divorce in one of their families, or  the death of a friend, making them a trio insytead of the quartet they  could possibly have been.  For me, it would have made the overarching theme  and messages much stronger and not fed into the somewhat stereotypical view  that only men are afraid of weddings, for no apparent reason.

To my surprise, this new version features a commentary track with the director Rick Famuyiwa, and star Taye Diggs and Richard T. Jones. I had to buy it, along with BSM (not ""BDSM""; ya'll are nasty!)Now, being that this commentary was recorded exactly eight years after the film was made, and being that The Wood is such a huge hit, you expect certain things about the production of the film, behind the scenes secrets to be told, etc. Really, the commentary doesn't touch that at all. Sure, they think back on the old times of making this movies, but really they don't discuss the movie. The other ""features include a reburbished previouly unreleased featurette about the back story of the movie; and the theatrical trailer. Honestly, i still think that they could have done better byt including music videos from songs on the soundtrack (who didn't like 'Neck Uv Da Woods', the brilliant combination of Outkast and Mystikal), and the others.

The people in this movie are realistically portrayed(just like most of Rick Famuyiwa's movies). Now I know most prudes are going to detest how these boys in this movie act but just remember one thing: THEY ARE KIDS!

Watch this and you'll know what I'm talking about when you hear them.If you or anyone in your circle is the kind of person that's always throwin' up timeless funny movie quotes, this is another one that's got some unforgettable gems.Other than that, unfortunately, I don't think ""The Wood"" will be talked about that much in say 10 years.Nothing groundbreaking here.",3,African-Americans can and do succeed ... we get it!,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,1245,"['good', 'see', 'variety', 'newer', 'unexplored', 'subject', 'matters', 'movies', 'tried', 'valiantly', 'portray', 'back', '1999.Particularly', 'like', 'refreshing', 'comedy', 'angle', 'TV', 'shows', 'Everybody', 'Chris', ""'ll"", 'more', 'likely', 'get', 'movie', 'Wood', 'buppie', 'Black', 'Urban', 'Professional', '/black', 'middle', 'class', 'slice', 'life/coming', 'age', 'kind', 'movie.It', 'decent', 'enough', 'solid', 'story', 'line', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'writing', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'seeing', '1997', 'Soul', 'Food', '2000', 'Love', 'Basketball', '2002', 'Brown', 'Sugar', '1997', 'Love', 'Jones', 'watching', 'one.Aside', 'seeing', 'good', 'black', 'movie', 'where', 'focus', ""n't"", 'race', 'violence', 'grim', 'circumstance', 'films', 'do', 'have', 'significant', 'place', 'only', 'truly', 'special', 'moments', 'took', 'away', 'film', 'were', 'couple', 'unforgettable', 'catchphrases.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'Watch', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'when', 'hear', 'anyone', 'circle', 'kind', 'person', 'always', 'throwin', 'up', 'timeless', 'funny', 'movie', 'quotes', 'one', 'got', 'unforgettable', 'gems.Other', 'unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Wood', 'will', 'be', 'talked', 'much', 'say', '10', 'years.Nothing', 'groundbreaking', 'here']",The Wood VHS
