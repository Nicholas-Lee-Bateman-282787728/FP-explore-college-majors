It was funny and heartfelt.  I ached for the pain the closeted character was going through.  So many of us can relate at least in some way to what he felt, and how he attempted to deal with it.  With the love of a friend, he was able to perservere, and come out happy and strong!  Watch this movie!",5,Loved it! Loved it!

1286651,A3UCBB9XD1SVK0,B002SF9YRU,"John Frame ""There Is No Substitute For Equality""","[3, 4]","The only person who deserves positive credit for Tru-Loved is whoeveredited the trailer, because it gives the distinct impression of acutting edge, highly relevant and entertaining film, but sadly thetrailer contains the only good and valuable few minutes of the entirefeature.Tonight after just five minutes I was seriously thinking of pressingthe fast forward or eject buttons, but since I'd paid a premium priceI was determined to see it through. What a tragic waste of time andmoney (for myself as well as the filmmakers). Tru-Loved is bloated,limp and literally drips with cheese - and in spite of being obviouslywell intended, it manages to fail in every regard as acceptable cinema.I was especially annoyed that there was so little skill demonstrated inthe sound design. There were repeated scenes (mainly in the tree house)where the voices dropped so low that I had to pump the volume on my ampto understand what was being said - and even then the voices were beingdrowned out by the sound of the actors' footfall. I had to then quicklyadjust the amp volume back down as the next scene blared out. That sortof careless attention to detail reflects directly on the technicalquality of the whole film.I had bought this DVD thinking it would be a youth positive asset foran LGBT community film night, but sadly it's much more likely to go inthe bin (as did ""The Curiosity Of Chance"" and ""Tan Lines"").",2,"Tru-Loved is bloated, limp and literally drips with cheese",1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,1405,"['only', 'person', 'who', 'positive', 'credit', 'Tru-Loved', 'whoeveredited', 'trailer', 'distinct', 'impression', 'acutting', 'edge', 'highly', 'relevant', 'entertaining', 'film', 'sadly', 'thetrailer', 'only', 'good', 'valuable', 'few', 'minutes', 'entirefeature.Tonight', 'just', 'five', 'minutes', 'was', 'seriously', 'thinking', 'pressingthe', 'fast', 'forward', 'eject', 'buttons', ""'d"", 'paid', 'premium', 'priceI', 'was', 'determined', 'see', 'What', 'tragic', 'waste', 'time', 'andmoney', 'as', 'well', 'filmmakers', 'Tru-Loved', 'bloated', 'limp', 'literally', 'drips', 'cheese', 'spite', 'being', 'obviouslywell', 'intended', 'fail', 'regard', 'acceptable', 'cinema.I', 'was', 'especially', 'annoyed', 'was', 'so', 'little', 'skill', 'demonstrated', 'inthe', 'sound', 'design', 'were', 'repeated', 'scenes', 'mainly', 'tree', 'house', 'where', 'voices', 'dropped', 'so', 'low', 'had', 'pump', 'volume', 'ampto', 'understand', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'even', 'then', 'voices', 'were', 'beingdrowned', 'out', 'sound', 'actors', 'footfall', 'had', 'then', 'quicklyadjust', 'amp', 'volume', 'back', 'down', 'next', 'scene', 'blared', 'out', 'sortof', 'careless', 'attention', 'detail', 'directly', 'technicalquality', 'whole', 'film.I', 'had', 'bought', 'DVD', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'youth', 'positive', 'asset', 'foran', 'LGBT', 'community', 'film', 'night', 'sadly', 'much', 'more', 'likely', 'go', 'inthe', 'bin', 'did', 'Curiosity', 'Chance', 'Tan', 'Lines']",N/A
