1095045,A3J0TTY0GFPPQP,B000UJ48OU,Adam J. Hopper,"[3, 5]","I enjoyed the first Hostel movie due to it's entertainment/shock value.  It was actually pretty funny, but at the same time it had very ominous undertones.  Hostel 2 however, is a much better movie in my opinion.  Director/Writer Eli Roth really put a lot into this movie.  This movie had smarter characters, smarter plot points, and it was executed better.  Roth made the smartest decision of all when he decided to continue the storyline started in the first Hostel.  Too many movies have attempted to do too much with sequals, instead of sticking to what the movie is supposed to be.  Lets face it, everyone that watches Hostel 2 knows exactly what to expect.  It wouldn't be Hostel if the characters don't end up being tortured by the Elite Hunting Club.  Friday the 13th has to have Jason Voorhees chopping up horny camp counselors.  The point is that Eli Roth was smart not to try to ""one up"" himself.  He stuck to the story, and added to it.  Yes we get torture in the movie.  Yes that is no surprise.  However we also get a few other aspects of the Hostel world.  We get an Elite Hunting Club leader added to the story.  We get an upgraded Elite Hunting Club security since the first protagonist took advantage of their weak security.  We get a group of girls being lured this time.  This means that promises of sex will not cut it.  Eli Roth wrote these girls so well.  I truly believed these characters, and what drove them to the ultimate goal.  The best addition to Hostel 2 was the two American business men going on their maiden voyage to the factory of torture.  These guys were so fun to watch.  You could truly see what would drive guys like this to commit the ultimate sin.  Also very believable characters.  The acting was superb from the whole cast.  The girls that do end up getting the nastiness in the factory make these scenes work.  It was thier acting ability that made the scenes real.  Eli Roth used so much symbolism throughout the movie to foreshadow what was coming.  The thing I am most impressed with about Hostel 2 is the underlying themes of Capitalism.  This movie shows that money makes the world go around and those who have the money have the power.

1095046,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000UJ48OU,A. Estes,"[5, 7]","The original ""Hostel"" was one of the most successful and memorable horror movies of the past few years that wasn't a remake. So, it's only natural that a sequel would follow it up, and with the brilliant Eli Roth back at the helm, ""Hostel"" is back in business just a little over a year later. The difference this time? Instead of three fun loving dudes, we are following three very different ladies around Europe as they study abroad, unaware of the fact that they may never be coming home. The original ""Hostel"" was effective because it took time to build the characters. About two thirds of that movie were dedicated solely to exposition. Then, when everything went wrong, it really went wrong. I will admit, however, upon my first viewing of ""Hostel,"" I found myself a bit bored, expecting much more carnage than was delivered (not the movie's fault) and wanting a little more action. This is where the second movie ups the ante. ""Hostel II,"" for better or for worse, is a crowd pleaser.In typical Eli Roth fashion, his love for the horror genre oozes through in nearly every scene. Nothing can capture this better than the fact that ""Hostel II"" is standard, by the books sequel material. The deaths are much more intricate and involved, the story moves much faster and there is far more explanation than before worked into the story. In the process, however, the movie tends to feel at times like a remake of the original, with the first half feeling somewhat stale and predictable. It isn't until the first death scene where we stop slouching and start paying attention. And from there, the movie puts us through a complete headspin. Despite the fact that you can pretty much assume who's going to die and who's going to survive in this movie, it's still engaging when things go down, because they don't happen in ways you would expect. I'd hate to beat around the bush here, but suffice it to say, even if you think you know where this movie is going, you're probably wrong.The trio of girls are quite an odd mix. We have the relatively-unknown Lauren German playing the obvious heroine, with Bijou Phillips playing the stereotypically obnoxious party girl, and the underrated Heather Matarazzo as the mousy nerd of the bunch. Watching these characters onscreen makes one wonder why they would ever be involved with each other, and the actresses themselves ironically fail to shine until their death scenes arrive. One of the best and most intriguing scenes in the movie is one in which we see the clients actually bidding online for their victims. This gives the movie more of a human feel, and makes the torture scenes all the more nauseating, giving you the impression that even the average joe sitting next to you on a bus could possibly have the desire to kill you for sport. Where this movie really differs from the first is that we get to know two of the clients, the timid Stuart, played by Roger Bart, and the arrogant and abrasive Todd played by Richard Burgi. As far as I'm concerned, these two are the most interesting part of the movie, as both actors effectively play their parts, while delivering characters that are flawed, human, and unpredictable. Each character makes decisions at the turn of a dime that you may not have seen coming, but probably should have.Overall, it's hard to find fault with ""Hostel II."" Despite the critics ripping it apart, it is a fun movie. Nothing was worth the ticket price more than to hear the theater erupt during a scene involving hedge-clippers and two hungry dogs. It may not be the blockbuster, popcorn flick you go for in June, but it's definitely a movie you'll walk away from, talking about for hours. Sure, it suffers from a case of sequelitis, and sure, it ends all too abruptly and on a bizarre note (ala ""Cabin Fever"") but it's good, it's original, and it's a horror movie.

With a surprisingly good reaction from the first one hey decided to make a second one. I must say while the first one was better than the second the second one was not that far off. In fact I felt they set this movie up perfect with following up with the first one. The one guy that was able to escape the chamber has been alive for awhile but has been paranoid that people were coming to kill him from the chamber. Sure enough when his wife woke up the next morning his head was cut off. It had a similar storyline from the first one but it was not as exciting. There were a lot of brutal killing scenes that added to the movie and I must warn you ahead of time that if you don't have a strong stomach that you should not watch this movie because it can be hard to watch at times.

Not even close. It's actually a quality film.Surprisingly, nearly every review I've read mentions the excessive violence.

I felt that even though it did satisfy my need for gore, the story didn't developed very well and thought the movie came across as ""cheap"" and very un-original.

On their way to Prague a total stranger, who fancies Beth, invites them into a ""spa"" located near their destination: Slovakia. From there on, we are thrown back at the Part I. All faces are familiar, and the hostel is quickly recognizable. After only a few days into the hostel, the girls start getting kidnapped; the bids start, and the games begin.Hostel Part II was enjoyable because the story was much more explainable than the first part.

The atmosphere was decent, the ambiance almost spot on, but then that stupid Michael Bay-ish music comes in and kills it.Roth seems to want to make true horror films, ones that don't entertain but scar most people, but he's got to realize in order to do something like that, more or less, you have to work away from the system, away from caring about if you get an R or NC-17; but, alas, he can't seem to come to terms with that.  All the films of the past that have really kicked people where it counts have been independent; Last House on the Left & Cannibal Holocaust immediately come to mind, and more recently stuff like Murder-Set-Pieces.I tried, tried, to enjoy this in, again, the context where it finds itself, but I just couldn't.  I understand, people are evil, and no matter how much they seem to be caring and sweet and like an extra out of High School Musical they can turn into vicious blood thirsty beasts, unworthy of sympathy or compassion; this isn't Straw Dogs, though, and the message falls flat.Thus far Roth is 0-3 in my book, so chances are any further efforts will simply be passed over.At least the Bathory thing was at least semi-cool, but not by much.2007 is apparently the ""year of don't bother going to the theater"" I sincerely hope Eastern Promises, There Will be Blood & No Country for Old Men don't follow this chain.",1,"Still unimpressed by Roth' ""abilities""",1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,2365,"['difficult', 'review', 'something', 'spouting', 'out', 'boring', 'cliche', 'OH', 'MAN', ""'VE"", 'SEEN', 'IT', 'ALL', 'AND', 'YOU', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'SHOCK', 'ME', 'THIS', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'GORY', 'one', 'respect', 'true', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'lot', '23', 'years', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'so', 'disturb', 'make', 'cringe', 'have', 'really', 'search', 'right', 'nerve', 'strike', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'mine', 'are', 'everyone', 'else', 'one', 'who', 'think', 'Jigsaw', 'so', 'evil', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah.This', 'was', ""n't"", 'not', 'gory', 'film', 'context', 'mainstream', 'horror', 'movie', 'so', 'showing', 'guy', 'get', 'johnson', 'snipped', 'off', 'bit', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'flocked', 'Return', 'King', 'are', 'used', 'seeing.Nothing', 'film', 'made', 'cringe', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'as', 'far', 'genital', 'amputation', 'go', 'Germany', 'Cannibal', 'basically', 'disposable', 'trash', 'just', 'first', 'series', 'use', 'music', 'was', 'really', 'REALLY', 'obnoxious', 'are', 'one', 'nails-on-the-chalkboard', 'cinematic', 'pet', 'peeves', 'exploitation', 'soundtrack', 'build', 'suspense', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'decent', 'ambiance', 'almost', 'spot', 'then', 'stupid', 'Michael', 'Bay-ish', 'music', 'kills', 'it.Roth', 'want', 'make', 'true', 'horror', 'films', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'entertain', 'most', 'people', 'got', 'realize', 'order', 'do', 'something', 'more', 'less', 'have', 'work', 'away', 'system', 'away', 'caring', 'get', 'R', 'NC-17', 'alas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'come', 'terms', 'films', 'past', 'have', 'really', 'kicked', 'people', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'independent', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', 'immediately', 'come', 'mind', 'more', 'recently', 'Murder-Set-Pieces.I', 'tried', 'tried', 'enjoy', 'again', 'context', 'where', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'people', 'are', 'evil', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'seem', 'be', 'caring', 'sweet', 'extra', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'can', 'turn', 'vicious', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'beasts', 'unworthy', 'sympathy', 'compassion', ""n't"", 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'though', 'message', 'flat.Thus', 'far', 'Roth', '0-3', 'book', 'chances', 'are', 'further', 'efforts', 'will', 'simply', 'be', 'passed', 'least', 'Bathory', 'thing', 'was', 'least', 'semi-cool', 'not', 'much.2007', 'apparently', 'year', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'going', 'theater', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'Will', 'be', 'Blood', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'chain']",N/A

If you are like me & weren't particularly crazy about the first one, you might still enjoy it. I waited for DVD on this one & actually watched it twice on the same day.I don't know where to begin on this one. For so many different reasons, Hostel 2 was a vast improvement over the first & I could easily watch it again. Roth had a great premise the first time around but really delivered the goods this time such as atmosphere, character development, & I like the overall flow much better. Lastly, the casting is damned near perfect. The leads work well together but I had to give Roth props for giving us the cameo appearance of Deodato as the Italian cannibal. Top notch!In addition to really giving us more insight on the main characters, Hostel 2 also sheds more the light on the underground torture ring. It wopuld seems things have changed a bit since Paxton (Jay Hernandez) escaped. Now they have cameras in every torture cell & the entire Slovakian factory is not as easy to access. This time around, bids are placed worldwide for the soon-to-be tortured Americans which is a interesting twist as well.Naturally, Hostel 2 does deliver the violence & gore as one would hope but the first forty minutes or so focus more on the developement of three college girls taking a trip to Prague & simply wanting to escape the encroachment of obnoxious guys on the train & elsewhere. What makes the sequel even more intriguing would be grand focus also on the two businessmen who have just shelled out thousands of dollars to shed some innocent blood. We eventually find out which one is the real monster when it comes time to kill the young women.Although Hostel 2 does reflect the ugly side of the world we live in, Roth also gives us a liberal dose of black comedy which makes his films all the more digestible. I do love the film even though I think the ending is a bit anti-climatic. Overall, I hope this is the last we will see of this series.

Aside from the ""Gorno"" aspect of this movie, this has a very frightening message to it. This shows how a persons mental psychi is different from how they may express it towards others. I wont say much more as it will give away the whole premise of the movie and that's something I don't want to do as this has a bit more of a story to it compared to the previous film.The movie starts out with Paxton (Jay Hernandez) who was the only survivor of the torture of the last film. It shows how he is coping with the trauma of watching his friends be tortured and killed and then himself experiencing such torment. The bosses of the Hostel catch up to Paxton and finally take him out to cancel the risk that he may reveal the sickening secret of the wealthy underworld.This film does have more of a structure to it when compared to the first one. Three girls are backpacking across Europe and they become friends with Axelle (Vera Jordanova) who we learn is affiliated with the boss of the Hostel. Axelle is simply leading these girls into a trap which would eventually end their lives. On another side of the movie we are introduced to two business men who bid on being the men who killed these women. One of them wants to do the killing to fullfill what he feels as a darkness inside him that will make him feared by his peers. The other is a man who is pushed into the act for the same reason to instill a sub-conscious fear within his fellow colleagues.If you're not familiar with the Hostel movies and are curious about them, then be warned. This film is extremely graphic with its no holds barred approach to blood and guts. It is a very entertaining film however and something that really makes you think and in a sense wonder if there are actually places like this in the world.A good film that I would really only recommend to those who are familiar with this genre of movie.",4,Gives Us A Frightening View Of The Modern Psychi,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,2059,"['Now', 'going', 'film', 'expected', 'be', 'grossed', 'out', 'simply', 'be', 'enraptured', 'how', 'far', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'could', 'take', 'gore', 'movie', 'try', 'surpass', 'previous', 'installment', 'Aside', 'Gorno', 'aspect', 'movie', 'very', 'frightening', 'message', 'how', 'persons', 'mental', 'psychi', 'different', 'how', 'may', 'express', 'others', 'wont', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'will', 'give', 'away', 'whole', 'premise', 'movie', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'bit', 'more', 'story', 'compared', 'previous', 'film.The', 'movie', 'out', 'Paxton', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'survivor', 'torture', 'last', 'film', 'how', 'coping', 'trauma', 'watching', 'friends', 'be', 'tortured', 'killed', 'then', 'experiencing', 'such', 'torment', 'bosses', 'Hostel', 'catch', 'up', 'Paxton', 'finally', 'take', 'out', 'cancel', 'risk', 'may', 'reveal', 'sickening', 'secret', 'wealthy', 'underworld.This', 'film', 'have', 'more', 'structure', 'when', 'compared', 'first', 'one', 'Three', 'girls', 'are', 'backpacking', 'Europe', 'become', 'friends', 'Axelle', 'Vera', 'Jordanova', 'who', 'learn', 'affiliated', 'boss', 'Hostel', 'Axelle', 'simply', 'leading', 'girls', 'trap', 'would', 'eventually', 'end', 'lives', 'side', 'movie', 'are', 'introduced', 'two', 'business', 'men', 'who', 'bid', 'being', 'men', 'who', 'killed', 'women', 'One', 'do', 'killing', 'fullfill', 'what', 'darkness', 'will', 'make', 'feared', 'peers', 'other', 'man', 'who', 'pushed', 'act', 'same', 'reason', 'instill', 'sub-conscious', 'fear', 'fellow', 'colleagues.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Hostel', 'movies', 'are', 'curious', 'then', 'be', 'warned', 'film', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'barred', 'approach', 'blood', 'guts', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'however', 'something', 'really', 'think', 'sense', 'wonder', 'are', 'actually', 'places', 'world.A', 'good', 'film', 'would', 'really', 'only', 'recommend', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'genre', 'movie']",N/A

Conceptually, HOSTEL: PART 2 was the perfect direction for Eli Roth to take the series, since it fully exposes the inner workings of the Elite Hunting Group by bringing the audience up close and personal with two of its members. While this portion of the film is pulled off to some degree, the half involving the girls and their struggle to survive falls completely flat. Unlike the guys in the original, Lauren German and Bijou Phillips are emotionally distant from their roles, and their acting is far more apparent. It feels every bit like a rushed production that falls back on repetitive storytelling techniques with less interesting characters. Even the worn and washed out appearance looks like it was shot on cut-rate film stock. The biggest disappointments come as the plainly obvious twists in the end that are repeatedly alluded to throughout the entire picture.

Yes, you read that right!!!  [...] But it blew me away!It obviously won't appeal to many people.  But Eli Roth pulls no punches with this sequel.  The fact that this was released mainstream is totally beyond my comprehension.  If you hated the original Hostel, why would you even bother with this one?Okay, I'm sure you know the story.  I won't go into any details of any of the horrendous torture scenes.  Just be prepared.There were other scenes that were totally frightening as well.  Like when one of the girls is being chased through the woods barefoot in her bathrobe.  Or when a girl is chained-up and suspended naked in mid-air, the long blade of a schythe is dragged along her back, not initially breaking the skin.  Just pure fright factor.  Or one of the most jolting non-violent scenes happens early on--pictures and descriptions of the 3 girls are sent to various clients on their blackberries.  Then the auction begins, each girls fate sold to the highest bidder.  [...] Heather Matarazzo(the nerdy schoolgirl from Welcome to the Dollhouse)gives an especially incredible performance.  Bijou Phillips(from Bully)doesn't try to tone down her sex appeal.  Lauren German is also stupendous.This is one brutal movie!

1095070,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,B000UJ48OU,CryWolf854,"[0, 0]","Reading some of these negative reviews this film has garnered all I can say is Wow, did any of you actually watch the movie?  Many, I suspect, watched the original and have chosen its sequel to express their hatred of its predecessor. I'm not going to do that seeing that I love Hostel 2 as well as Hostel.Picking up exactly where Hostel left off, we find Pax (Jay Hernandez) still trying to come to terms with what he survived overseas. In a direct homage to Friday the 13th part 2, we are given closure to Hostel through Pax's fate. Jump forward to Rome where we find three American girls studying abroad. Following the promise by a beautiful model of a unique hot springs spa, the girls find themselves in the very same hostel that works as a front to the underground torture ring. Soon the girls are in way over their heads but one of them is far more determined to beat the odds and win back her freedom. We also meet two American men who are also staying at the hostel but for a much darker purpose and its through these two (Roger Bart and Richard Burgi, both of tv's ""Desperate Housewives"") that Hostel 2 makes its leap from a quick cash in sequel to a stand alone film. Where Hostel trapped us in along with its victims forcing us to act as voyeurs to the tortures and murders, Hostel 2 gives us a chance to see through the eyes of prey as well as the predators.Eli Roth really did a great job in the casting primarily with Bart and Lauren German (2003's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). Lauren is not only as talented as she is beautiful but there is this underlining strength in her that makes her fit perfectly in the role of the film's heroine. And how she turns the tables on her torturer is very fitting. Roger Bart undergoes another change and it comes as a complete surprise especially after seeing how he plays his character. Rounding out the cast is Bijou Phillips (Bully, Venom) and Heather Matarazzo (Welcome To the Dollhouse, The Princess Diaries). Phillips plays her usual role of slutty party girl and Matarazzo plays the reserve and naive underdog. While I can't stand Mattress per say, I have to give her credit for really selling her death scene. Her performance as well as some really strong sound fx really assaults the senses and leaves you squirming in your seat.  As a trio, the girls are much more sympathetic then the three guys of Hostel. Plus, being girls, the vast majority of viewers would rather not see them hacked up and chopped to bits.While it won't win any awards, Hostel 2 is no where near as bad as some of these idiotic reviews are saying it is. Its Hostel 2 and its not like you don't know what you're getting ready to see as evidence of its predessor's reputation. If the sight of blood and guts and people inflicting pain on one another offends you, don't watch it. Go rent the gore less, PC friendly Scream 3 or Halloween H20 and Resurrection instead and leave true horror to its true fans. Horror movies are suppose to make you uncomfortable. They're not suppose to scare you and than apologize by throwing a joke or one liner to make you laugh. The horror tide finally seems to be returning to where it truly belongs.Post Script: For some reason I can't help but wonder if the story would have had a bigger, more epic feel had we seen the six principal victims of both films pass one another either in the hostel or at the festival. Forget the opening bridge and pretend Pax hadn't made it back to the States.

1095071,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000UJ48OU,Dave. K,"[2, 4]","For me, the biggest problem with Hostel: Part II is the movie is just too clich&eacute;d. From the characters to the concept it suffers from having been there, done that. It's tough sometimes making a sequel. You wanna try and offer something different, but cannot stray too much from the formula and risk losing the fan base. Though I will say is Eli Roth does manage to do more than just rehash the original, granted I just said before it suffers from the, been there, done that, but Roth is able to add a little bit more.The thing about Eli Roth is he is able to develop characters. A lot of people knock him for his characters and say they lack depth. That couldn't be further from the truth. Just because you didn't like them doesn't mean they lacked depth. In both Hostel movies it takes at least 40-minutes before anything really big happens. Everything before that is all about the characters.This time around Roth again sets up the characters and develops them, but the problem here is they are too clich&eacute;d. We have the nerdy girl, the slutty girl and the nice girl with a little bit of an edge. The characters in Hostel: Part II is the typical characters we have seen millions of times before. Due to that it can be tough to really feel for them. Though to Roth's credit they don't come across as fake; they are real people maybe even like someone you know. So due to that you might feel for them a bit when these bad things begin to happen to them.Hostel: Part II also focuses a bit on the people involved with Elite Hunting, from those who run it and the people that pay to do these terrible things to others. That was an interesting concept, but does take away from the mystery of it. So it's sort of that double edged sword. And like the would be victims the characters who pay to do these terrible things are also a bit clich&eacute;d, one guy who's excited, but afterwards can't handle it and the weak guy who suddenly steps up and goes psycho.Eli Roth's script wasn't bad, the characters have depth despite being clich&eacute;d, but something just wasn't fully working. While not a bad script it didn't have the moments the original had. Like I said the characters have depth and you do get to know them a bit, but when all is said and done the clich&eacute; is what hurts. But the script wasn't bad, and it did have its fair share of creative moments.Like the original, Roth takes his time getting into things, but this time around it doesn't work quite as well. The comedy here doesn't work as well and it does hurt the pacing of the movie at times and the nudity is very much toned down this time around. Eli Roth is able to put together some solid scenes, but the pacing does drag at times. The party scene really does start to drag and it seems like it goes on forever. A couple of minutes could have easily been trimmed on that scene.Once the action kicks in Hostel II does pick up. Though it does lack compared to the original, but it still works rather well for the most part. Even in the 2nd half there are slight pacing problems. Hostel: Part II would have greatly benefited from a few minutes being cut out. There isn't that sense of dread and tension the original had. While Hostel II does have it's moments like that it does lack compared to the original. But there are some solid moments with a great feel of dread and looming danger. The scene with one of the characters hung upside down and being sliced was probably my favorite scene, it was sick and twisted and had this great sense of tension. The character is totally helpless and it does add to the tension.The gore level is about the same as the original. In some ways it's gorier, but also has less gore. Despite the reputation of Hostel the torture scenes weren't that bloody. There was gore, but not the way people make it out to be. A lot of the gore comes from shots of mutilated bodies. This time around the torture scenes do feature a lot more gore. I can't help, but think Roth added more for all the people that complained about the first Hostel being gory. It's like he was saying you really wanna see some gore? Well here you go.Lauren German gives a fantastic performance as Beth, she was the nice girl with a bit of an edge, while her character may not be the most original she isn't the little goodie two shoes most heroines are in these kinda movies. The rest of the performances are pretty good as well. Roger Bart does a solid job and Richard Burgi nearly steals the show.Overall Hostel: Part II is a pretty good sequel. While it does suffer from some clich&eacute;s and really doesn't have the dread and tension of the original there are many solid scenes. What they lack in tension, they make up for in gore. The pacing was just a bit off and like I said Hostel II would have greatly benefited from some editing.The highlights of Hostel: Part II are the cameos by 70s cult Icon Edwige Fenech as the Art Class Professor and Ruggero Deodato director of Cannibal Holocaust playing none other than a cannibal. And I must say as I write this review Edwige Fenech is almost 60-years old and is still as beautiful now as she was back in the 70s.",4,"Overall a good sequel,despite some pacing

Arent the killings supposed to actually be in the film and not just talked about ?  There was more torture in one of the Lassie movies with Timmy falling down the well.  Gimme a break.  People are getting killed right ?  My version only had one person.  There was no torture, one killing and a ridiculous waste of time.  They spent two thirds of the movie just getting to the chamber.  Thats what I get for believing reviews and what the movie says about itself.

When he was ranting about the flick on the radio this past Monday he was calling it a Snuff Film.  Some folks on this site seem to be doing the same.  Are you people all scared little mouth-breathing morons who live at a repressive church?  Okay, class, lets talk about Snuff films.  Snuff films are films of REAL people REALLY being murdered or REALLY being tortured and sold underground to weirdos who get off on that kind of thing.  Now most Snuff films have been sold as real, but then confirmed to be FAKES.  So what?  Rich weirdos who like to know their violence is real get duped.  I can live with that, can you?  Basically, a REAL Snuff Film with REAL DEATH and REAL VIOLENCE are as real as Alligators in the sewers of New York, and the outcome of drinking soda with pop-rocks.  Deal with it Faces of Death was a fake too.  Just watch it now with more mature eyes and you'll see just how cheesy and fake it all really is.  Besides just click on the internet or the news channels if you want to get your jollies off on violence.  There it's real and there's more of it in the news than in this film.Hostel films aren't Snuff films because no actual REAL violence is happening on screen.  It's all PRETEND and very REALISTIC SPECIAL EFFECTS.  A caller made the point to retard Savage that no one actually got hurt making these films to which his reply was something along the lines of, ""Nobody got hurt?  What about all the young or impressionable minds that viewed the garabage? They didn't get hurt?  You know that they've proven that films like this give people ideads on how to murder and torture don't you? It's documented.""Really?Huh, I didn't know that was a fact.  If that's a fact, haven't we just discovered the ultimate way to end all violent crime?  Hell, we could even reform criminals now.  Take a copy of Cinderalla(Disney version) to Rikers and make the prisoner's watch it.  They were so impressionable to violence they should be impressionable towards the sweet values of a Disney cartoon.  Can't you see all those hardened Riker's prisoners sporting shirts saying, ""Be good kids.  You don't want to end up like a Wicked Stepmother!""  I hate you people...Also TORTURE PORN was orignally used as a term of ENDEARMENT towards a shift in tone and material the horror genre was displaying after many years of watered down, loaded with ghosts, Tiger Beat fair.  The writer who coined the word was being funny.  He was actually alluding to the fact that horror seems to get harder and more brutal due to what's going on in the real world.  And these movies started becoming popular right around WAR TIME, TERRORIST TORTURE AND WATERBOARDING, OUR SOLDIERS GETTING BEHEADED ON THE INTERENT AND PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ACTUALLY WATCHING IT, and LIVES, AMERICAN LIVES, AMERICAN SOLDIERS DYING FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S GREED.  This is what these films spit back in your face.  DEAL WITH IT.  CHANGE THE WORLD, DON'T WHINE ABOUT HORROR MOVIES.Sorry about that.  The film itself is great.  It's an improvement of the theme set in motion in the original.  We get to know more about the people who pay for the torture which is scary because they don't seem like obvious candidates for sociopaths, they look like they could be your neighbors or co-workers.  The ending has a nice twist that dots the eye on director's main point: lives have a dollar amount attached to them these days, and maybe they always have.  Good, gross, thoughtful, relevant, blackly humorous, well acted and directed, and fast paced modern horror cinema.  Haters need to move on.PS: SAW is lumped in as torture porn, but has less on screen gore and violence than all of it's sequels and the films of such respected main stream directors like Brian De Palma, Oliver Stone, Steven Spielberg, and even Alfred Hitchcock himself(check out his film FRENZY).LATER",5,"Retard, ultra conservative radio personality Michael Savage finally saw this movie...",1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,3880,"['Eli', 'Roth', 'jailed', 'hysterical', 'When', 'was', 'ranting', 'flick', 'radio', 'past', 'Monday', 'was', 'calling', 'Snuff', 'Film', 'folks', 'site', 'seem', 'be', 'doing', 'same', 'Are', 'people', 'scared', 'little', 'mouth-breathing', 'morons', 'who', 'live', 'repressive', 'church', 'Okay', 'class', 'talk', 'Snuff', 'films', 'Snuff', 'films', 'are', 'films', 'REAL', 'people', 'REALLY', 'being', 'murdered', 'REALLY', 'being', 'tortured', 'sold', 'underground', 'weirdos', 'who', 'get', 'off', 'kind', 'thing', 'Now', 'most', 'Snuff', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'sold', 'real', 'then', 'confirmed', 'be', 'FAKES', 'So', 'what', 'Rich', 'weirdos', 'who', 'know', 'violence', 'real', 'get', 'duped', 'can', 'live', 'can', 'Basically', 'REAL', 'Snuff', 'Film', 'REAL', 'DEATH', 'REAL', 'VIOLENCE', 'are', 'as', 'real', 'Alligators', 'sewers', 'New', 'York', 'outcome', 'drinking', 'soda', 'pop-rocks', 'Deal', 'Faces', 'Death', 'was', 'fake', 'too', 'Just', 'watch', 'now', 'more', 'mature', 'eyes', ""'ll"", 'see', 'just', 'how', 'cheesy', 'fake', 'really', 'Besides', 'just', 'click', 'internet', 'news', 'channels', 'want', 'get', 'jollies', 'off', 'violence', 'real', 'more', 'news', 'film.Hostel', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'Snuff', 'films', 'actual', 'REAL', 'violence', 'happening', 'screen', 'PRETEND', 'very', 'REALISTIC', 'SPECIAL', 'EFFECTS', 'A', 'caller', 'made', 'point', 'retard', 'Savage', 'one', 'actually', 'got', 'hurt', 'making', 'films', 'reply', 'was', 'something', 'lines', 'Nobody', 'got', 'hurt', 'What', 'young', 'impressionable', 'minds', 'viewed', 'garabage', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'hurt', 'know', ""'ve"", 'proven', 'films', 'give', 'people', 'ideads', 'how', 'murder', 'torture', 'do', ""n't"", 'documented', 'Really', 'Huh', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'fact', 'fact', 'have', ""n't"", 'just', 'discovered', 'ultimate', 'way', 'end', 'violent', 'crime', 'Hell', 'could', 'even', 'reform', 'criminals', 'now', 'Take', 'copy', 'Cinderalla', 'Disney', 'version', 'Rikers', 'make', 'prisoner', 'watch', 'were', 'so', 'impressionable', 'violence', 'should', 'be', 'impressionable', 'sweet', 'values', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'hardened', 'Riker', 'prisoners', 'sporting', 'shirts', 'saying', 'Be', 'good', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'up', 'Wicked', 'Stepmother', 'hate', 'people', 'Also', 'TORTURE', 'PORN', 'was', 'orignally', 'used', 'term', 'ENDEARMENT', 'shift', 'tone', 'material', 'horror', 'genre', 'was', 'displaying', 'many', 'years', 'watered', 'down', 'loaded', 'ghosts', 'Tiger', 'Beat', 'fair', 'writer', 'who', 'coined', 'word', 'was', 'being', 'funny', 'was', 'actually', 'alluding', 'fact', 'horror', 'get', 'harder', 'more', 'brutal', 'due', 'what', 'going', 'real', 'world', 'movies', 'started', 'becoming', 'popular', 'right', 'WAR', 'TIME', 'TERRORIST', 'TORTURE', 'AND', 'WATERBOARDING', 'OUR', 'SOLDIERS', 'GETTING', 'BEHEADED', 'ON', 'THE', 'INTERENT', 'AND', 'PEOPLE', 'IN', 'THIS', 'COUNTRY', 'ACTUALLY', 'WATCHING', 'IT', 'LIVES', 'AMERICAN', 'LIVES', 'AMERICAN', 'SOLDIERS', 'DYING', 'FOR', 'SOMEONE', 'ELSE', 'GREED', 'what', 'films', 'spit', 'back', 'face', 'DEAL', 'IT', 'CHANGE', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'WHINE', 'ABOUT', 'HORROR', 'MOVIES.Sorry', 'film', 'great', 'improvement', 'theme', 'set', 'motion', 'original', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'pay', 'torture', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'obvious', 'candidates', 'sociopaths', 'look', 'could', 'be', 'neighbors', 'co-workers', 'ending', 'nice', 'twist', 'eye', 'director', 'main', 'point', 'lives', 'have', 'dollar', 'amount', 'attached', 'days', 'maybe', 'always', 'have', 'Good', 'gross', 'thoughtful', 'relevant', 'blackly', 'humorous', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'fast', 'paced', 'modern', 'horror', 'cinema', 'Haters', 'need', 'move', 'on.PS', 'SAW', 'lumped', 'torture', 'porn', 'less', 'screen', 'gore', 'violence', 'sequels', 'films', 'such', 'respected', 'main', 'stream', 'directors', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'even', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'FRENZY', '.LATER']",N/A

Luckily, writer/director Eli Roth did a great job at accomplishing this rare feat!  Roth adeptly avoided the pitfalls and traps that so many in his field fall into...such as trying too hard to outdo his earlier work with obvious ploys like Hollywood glitz, sparkle and fluff in the form of over-done special effects that are focused on more than paying attention to putting out a good flick.  Yes, there is a little more torture in this second movie...not much, but a little.  and frankly, BOTH movies would have benefitted from more torture!  I do prefer to watch this second movie more than the first.  Even though the original had more female nudity in it (always a good thing), I seem to like the second story better...although I'll admit it's purely a matter of personal opinion.  I'll also admit that if someone were to say they like the first movie better, I would not be able to argue the point.  I think I like the second movie better because I just prefer the victims to be female.  and since the second movie focuses on how FEMALE victims came into this mess, the plot is more enjoyable for me.  (although as I said, the first flick is better at having more female nudity...always a plus!)  The point is, Roth did a great job with the second flick because he did not try to outdo the first flick!  he just stuck to his guns and wrote and directed a second movie that had merit on its own, without depending on, leaning on or needing to outshine the original.  the plot is impressive enough for this perverse genre...the script works well...the acting is more than adequate.  the special effects are impressive and daunting...but he did not got bogged down in trying to ""be better"" than his first effort.  so to sum up, the second flick could have had more violence and torture and more female nudity...it does have a bit more torture than the first...and I think it's a more enjoyable watch than the first Hostel.  Thank you, Eli for having that rare sequel...a sequel that stands up to the original great flick!  and kudos to Quentin Tarantino for having the smarts to hitch his wagon to both of these wonderfully gruesome and grizzly, repulsive movies!

1095078,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B000UJ48OU,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[0, 3]","Many will say that Hostel 2 is no different than the first Hostel.  I will have to disagree.  Hostel 2 has a similar scenario, with 3 college age girls (instead of 2 boys) spending some time in Europe, partying and such, getting a bit too close to the wrong people, and ending up in the torture scene.  However, that is only part of the story this time.  There is a whole another tale that is told, and that is the background about the people and organization that do the torturing.  The three girls are not the only main characters in Hostel 2, but we also follow 2 guys who get themselves involved with the dirty side of things.Overall, Hostel II loses the creepy horror appeal the first Hostel had.  Since we get to know a little more about the organization, that feeling of suspense and the unknown is now gone.  The only thing left to see are new and inventive scenes of torture, which don't get much more inventive than the few shown here.  Although the scenes of torture were even pushed further this time, I felt like it was more for show than for horror.  It felt like less time was spent in the factory this time too, again loosing some of that dark, suspense feeling that the first Hostel built up on.One surprise was the beginning of the film, which actually follows up directly after the ending of the first Hostel, with Jay Hernandez reprising his role for the first 5 minutes.  After that, the new story gets rolling, though mostly focusing on the three girls and their journey around Europe.  It takes some time for the real horror to begin, and in the meantime the story gets a bit slow.  The real interest was following the two men.  Though it takes away form the horror, we get to see that these are just ordinary men who live out natural lives with families.  Both are friends, and one always semed far more anxious than the other to go through with the torturing to come.  When they finally get to the scenes of torture, its very interesting how each guy handles there situation.

1095081,A1EGZYG8PC51U5,B000UJ48OU,"D. Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[3, 4]","Sometimes directors are bigger than their movies... Eli Roth is one of these directors (even with such a small catalog of material).  The problem isn't that when he's asked questions in interviews he says what he thinks, or the way he looks, or that he's willing to push the boundries of good taste in his films or anything like that (well, not completely at least) but rather that he recieved such heaping praise in such a short time that it was bound to have a negative effect (like the new kid in high school, popular right away but eventually gets his a#$ kicked for it).  Anytime your being talked about as a posible ""savior"" of the genre, especially after only your first film... the next movie you make better be a Horror masterpiece.  Well, none of Eli's movies to date have been masterpieces, they've been enjoyable, but not the type of films that will become staples on anyone's top 50 of all time list (although this is Amazon so I'm sure I'm wrong there... in fact I think I've seen Boogeyman on some peoples lists?!).  Hostel 2 is basically more of the same from Mr. Roth and his two previous movies.  Take some young people, try to make them likeable (which hasn't really happened for me yet), and then put them through hell.  Basic formula, but he does it well (Romero on zombies is a similiar situation).  Here he takes the same premise as the first (young people being tricked into going to Slovikia where... well, you know the rest) except here he's replaced the male leads with a group of females (hijinxs ensue).  I've seen alot of people blast the movie for being more or less the same film, to which I say, ""yeah, it is called Hostel, just with a 2 behind it,"" and actually, this time we get a pretty interesting look at our antagonists which is a nice addition.  Probably what put this one over the first for me is just this, what are the sick freaks who are into this kind of stuff like?  Although not overly in depth, the scenes involving the exploration of these men and their experience on the other side of the torture kept my attention completely throughout.  Another thing that this film shares with it's predecessor is the pacing... it takes awhile for things to get messy, however when it does we get treated to some fairly extreme acts of depravity (even as a hardened horror fan, the bathtub scene was... wow, just see it for yourself I guess).  If you don't like any of Eli Roth's previous films already then this won't change your mind, if you do though, then make sure to check this out ASAP.

Wanting to see this because I thought Hostel really touched on some ideas which had rich subplots to them, which could be carried on into other films of this genre perhaps, or wondering if Eli Roth, as self centered and ego driven as he is, was hoping that perhaps he would find a bit of charisma, chemistry, cohesion, character or hmmm, I don't know, perhaps something tangible in all of this, and we are left with nothing but a purposeless redundant look at a really horrific script with dry humor that bordered on revolting and cliched nuances that deeply moved me to actually think about turning it off, which I have never done since walking out of Spaced Invaders. I didn't care one iota about the girls in the movie, in fact I was hoping they would be killed.Eli Roth said this in an interview: ""Yeah man, I'm f***ing psyched. I honestly think that no matter what other movie comes out this summer -- no matter what their budget is -- nothing will even come close to the kind of ending we have in Hostel 2. I think it's one of the most shocking endings people have ever seen in a mainstream horror film. I think this is the movie where people are going to come out of it going, 'I can't even believe someone just did that.""I can't believe it was so bad.

That said, I loved the feel of the movie. It's very slow and builds the characters of the three girls nicely. I loved seeing Heather Matarazzo, as this sweet, loopy girl traveling through Europe. You also get to follow two of the would-be killers, these regular ""guy next door"" types that creeped me out beyond belief.

Besides the bath scene, which is just one of the most disturbing things I think I have ever seen in a movie, I think you can tell that this movie is very anti-violence and is meant to be some sort of criticism about capitalism. The shots of the sickos of the world ""bidding"" on girls they want to MURDER drives this home. The fact that Todd thinks killing a defenseless college girl will some how make him a BIG SCARY MAN in the business world is really sick. But, I can imagine there are people like that in this world.

While we get a brief glimpse into the life of one of the original's main characters, Paxton, Hostel II shifts its primary focus on to a new group of adventurous young adults, who are out to prove that guys don't get to have all the fun while on vacation in Europe!This time, the main characters are Beth, Whitney, and Lorna, three American college students taking a summer art course in Italy.  While the three girls have their differences, they decide to overcome any hostile feelings towards each other and instead plan to bond over a weekend girls' getaway to Prague.  While on the train, they run into a familiar face - Axelle, the friendly art model from their summer class!After learning of Axelle's plans to spend a luxurious break at the natural spas in Slovakia, the 3 American girls decide to change their plans and tag along.  And they are in for a treat!  Not only are the spas fabulous, but the town is celebrating its annual harvest festival, and it appears as though both Whitney and Lorna are destined to find romance in this Eastern European paradise.  Beth meets a pleasant American gentleman, Stuart, who she has the fortune to keep bumping into throughout the film.Of course, no European adventure is complete without some sort of debacle!  The girls find themselves in a bit of hot water following the harvest festival dance -- but don't worry too much!  When things appear as though they couldn't get any darker, Stuart appears!

This time, there are three college girls who are lured into a Hostel in Slovakia instead of three men.  One of the characters was supposed to be the odd one and I thought that her character was too ""over the top"".  No one acts like that character in real life.  All three were supposed to be college students but one of them acted like she was a patient at a mental institution or an insane asylum.  It's no surprise that she was the first one to be captured and killed.  That first scene was perhaps the most horrifying of the film (with the exception of the castration scene).  I think the scene would have even been more horrifying if the character was more beliveable.  Most will not be able to make a strong connection with her.  But still, that scene is like nothing I've seen before.In listening to the director's commentary, in this movie he was making a statement about capitalism and the Bush administration.  He demonstrates how these rich men in the film are nothing but heartless greedy jerks who consider it nothing but a game in bidding on human lives.  In the beginning of the film there is a montage of rich men auctioning off the three women.  The girls go to the highest bidders, then they travel to Europe to go to the factory to torture and kill their prizes.  It may seem sick the director comments, but the Bush Administration is doing the same thing... pointing to how many people and organizations have become rich off of the Iraq war and how heartless the government was for the Katrina victims.  But if he felt that way, the only question I have is: Why didn't he put any black people in the film?The story line of this film was OK, but there was one big inconsistency.  The girl who was able to buy her way out and become a member of the exclusive hunt club killed another member of the club.  Why would she do something so stupid?  I know they just put that in for the drama, but it just doesn't make any sense.

Soon thereafter a rich person pays to torture and kill the helpless kid.Hostelturned heads for its shock factor, with realistic gore, torture, and close ups of some really brazen death scenes.  Eli Roth provides it all for the sake of pure horror.  There are no ambiguities or false pretenses; people are going to be graphically tortured and murdered.  If you don't like it, don't watch.  Hostel II is no different in this respect; however, it is different in the build up.Picking up where the first one left off, a few bits of unfinished business take place.  Whereas the first movie didn't really suck me in, or make me like the characters at all, a better job was done this time to create viewer empathy (except for Heather Matarazzo, who I hate as an actress).  Apathy, or possibly ambivalence, ruled the initial movie, but genuine terror oozes out of this session of tensely persuasive torture porn, especially during a depraved bathroom scene with a scythe that provides enough blood to makeCarriejealous.With a subtle, contemporary tribute to the classicThe Most Dangerous Game, it's a sickeningly sadistic look at morality, or the lack thereof in our culture.

I even liked it better than the first one. I liked the fact that you learn more about the trap, about the way the secret organization works, the way they send their victim's picture on people's cell phone and so on. I liked the fact that women are the victims instead of men (not because i'm deranged but because, as a man, i want to protect women. And all men, once in their life, has dreamnt of being a white knight in shining armor saving an helpless princess - in this film, we get to imagine ourselves saving these poor women). I liked the fact that the two brothers participating in these torture games have second thoughts. They might even change their minds and save those girls. In terms of emotion, there's nothing like a bad character trying to be good.So, the special effects were the same as the first one. The tension was the same. The process was the same. But you add more emotion. So i enoyed it better than the first one. Plus, they finally showed those strange little kids on a more human level (ok they play soccer with a severed head but still...), meaning that they were scared and they were more or less easily shoved aside by one of the woman. Before, they just seemed like little superhuman devils that nothing could intimidate.In all, i'd like to see Eli Roth make a third and final one in which you'd see an international police force dismantled the whole sick organization.

He is also suffering terrible flashbacks.  Soon, his girlfriend kicks him out of their house.In this installment, three young girls; Beth (Lauren German), Lorna (Heather Matarazzo), and Whitney (Bijou Phillips) decide to take a break from their studies in Italy and go to Slovakia for a vacation.  While on their way, they meet another girl, Axelle (Vera Jordanova).  Axelle convinces the others to change their plans and instead go to a relaxing outdoor spa.Meanwhile, two American businessmen; Todd (Richard Burgi) and Stuart (Roger Bart) have heard about the Elite Hunting Club.  Todd has ""bought"" his friend Stuart a girl to kill.  Soon, the two guys are flying to the torture chamber.Unknown to the girls, Axelle is working for the Elite Hunting Club, and soon, Beth, Lorna, and Whitney are captured and placed in the chamber.  However, Stuart is having second thoughts about his involvement with Todd.  Will anyone survive this time around?I enjoyed this movie more than the first one.  There is less sex in this one.  Instead, director Eli Roth has focused more on the blood and terror, which he accomplishes perfectly.  There are some truly memorable scenes, such as the scene where Lorna is suspended, nude, above another woman, who systematically cuts and slices her, while bathing in Lorna's blood. But, the ending is the best, and male viewers will most definitely want to cross their legs.I recommend this scary and terror-filled film.

Hostel II does pretty much what the original did, this time with women being the victims. I've seen the film plenty of times (thanks to Netflix), but I just recieved the DVD today so the extras will be reviewed in a future edit. This is mainly about the film itself.If you like to watch horror movies that make you jump, have some gore (I'm not a big fan of gore but Eli Roth & Tarrentino use gore in a different way than some, that comes off better than most gory movies). I guess when the movie itself is good enough you can look past the gore. Again Roth won me over with this sequel. There is just something different about Hostel II that even paired with the original is different from a lot of horror movies in recent years, with the possible exception of the SAW series. Even then there are major differences. In the SAW movies you had one man who was psycho and he found others to do his work to test bad people and most of them failed the tests, mazes etc. In Hostel II you have the same place basically, but the motivation is something more realistic. I wouldn't be surprised if such a place existed in a cruel world like ours.If you want to sit down with a spouse, date or even alone this is a good film to spook you. If you're a critic of horror movies (& gore in particular) this might not be for you. If you are the type to simply give a movie a chance and you love horror movies check this one out.The women in this movie are very attractive, for the most part likeable. Just like the characters in the original, you end up liking them. If you like the original Hostel then you will most likely enjoy this one.

Writer-Director Eli Roth and producer Quention Tarantino really delivers a sequel with more thrills and chills plus more gore such as the cringe-inducing castration sequence that is quite realistic, a young boy being shot, saw-blade to the skull etc. and decent acting. There is some darkly humorous moments especially the ending which i can't reveal but has to be seen to believe, legendary Italian horror director Ruggero Deoato (director of ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""Jungle Holocaust"") makes an amusing cameo appearence as a cannibal doctor.This DVD contains the uncut unrated version with footage not shown in the theatrical cut and has some goodies like three audio commentaries, radio interview with Eli Roth, deleted scenes, Gag Reel, International Televison Special on the film's making, and four featurettes.",4,An improvement over the original!,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,1418,"['Three', 'American', 'girls', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'Lauree', 'German', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'are', 'European', 'vacation', 'studying', 'art', 'aboard', 'train', 'Italy', 'Slovokia', 'where', 'stay', 'while', 'local', 'hostel', 'unique', 'hot', 'springs', 'spa', 'where', 'harmless', 'vacation', 'later', 'nightmare', 'unrelentless', 'horror', 'when', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'criminals', 'torture', 'murder', 'people', 'profit', 'can', 'escape', 'horror', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'flawed', 'effort', 'torture', 'horror', 'i', 'believe', 'very', 'slight', 'improvement', 'original', 'movie', 'Writer-Director', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'producer', 'Quention', 'Tarantino', 'really', 'sequel', 'more', 'thrills', 'chills', 'more', 'gore', 'such', 'cringe-inducing', 'castration', 'sequence', 'quite', 'realistic', 'young', 'boy', 'being', 'shot', 'saw-blade', 'skull', 'etc', 'decent', 'acting', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'moments', 'especially', 'ending', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'be', 'seen', 'believe', 'legendary', 'Italian', 'horror', 'director', 'Ruggero', 'Deoato', 'director', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', 'Jungle', 'Holocaust', 'amusing', 'cameo', 'appearence', 'cannibal', 'doctor.This', 'DVD', 'uncut', 'unrated', 'version', 'footage', 'not', 'shown', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'goodies', 'three', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'radio', 'interview', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Gag', 'Reel', 'International', 'Televison', 'Special', 'film', 'making', 'four', 'featurettes']",N/A

Once you realize what this place was all about, then the terror sets in. For those who have travelled outside the US as much as I have, you know this movie has believability. Hostel II has no such mystery, after you have seen part one, you know what the Hunter's Club is all about. So with no mystery, where can you go? Deeper into the organization of course. Instead of three men, this time it is three women who are the hunted victims. To me, this just makes the film more interesting. Also, we discover the fate of our 'hero' in part one. His head is on display in a secret closet.As soon as you see the European woman make her appearance and ask ""Did someone lose this iPod?"", you figure she's in on it, when she takes the three Americans to the Hostel, there is no question. In this movie we now see what the creepy dude behind the counter does with those passports. He scans them and sends photos out to Hunting Club members, where they bid on them like a human eBay.My favorite scene is the killer who fancies herself to be Elizabeth Bathory, who kills the first American victim. The scene was as erotic as it was terrifying.In this movie we also follow the tracks of two American businessmen who travel to Slovakia for the kill. One is a gung-ho, cocaine snorting, big shot who is all for it, the other is a meek, nerdy guy who doesn't seem to be into it. But the tables turn and true colors show when the men are alone with their victims. Cokehead is all into it before he accidently cuts the head of the hot blond with a circular saw. He then realizes that he wants no part of this and attempts to leave. He is very nicely torn apart by killer dogs in the elevator. The nerd turns out to be the real psycho. He wants to kill someone because he cannot kill his wife. Unfortunately he is also incredibly stupid. The tables turn once again as the rich girl is now in control and nerd boy gets to have his penis cut off with a pair of scissors and watches it being eaten by a dog.Eurogirl gets hers in the end Marie Antoinette style when the Little Rascals from Hell set her up for rich girl's revenge.Like I said there is no mystery here, but for those who enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this one on a different label because you see who is in charge of the slaughter house and just how many people are invilved.",5,Hostel 2 ROCKS!!!!!!,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,2441,"['first', 'Hostel', 'had', 'mystery', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'were', 'wondering', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'going', 'realize', 'what', 'place', 'was', 'then', 'terror', 'who', 'have', 'travelled', 'US', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'know', 'movie', 'believability', 'Hostel', 'II', 'such', 'mystery', 'have', 'seen', 'part', 'one', 'know', 'what', 'Hunter', 'Club', 'about', 'So', 'mystery', 'where', 'can', 'go', 'Deeper', 'organization', 'course', 'Instead', 'three', 'men', 'time', 'three', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'hunted', 'victims', 'just', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'Also', 'discover', 'fate', ""'hero"", 'part', 'one', 'head', 'display', 'secret', 'closet.As', 'soon', 'see', 'European', 'woman', 'make', 'appearance', 'ask', 'Did', 'someone', 'lose', 'iPod', 'figure', 'when', 'three', 'Americans', 'Hostel', 'question', 'movie', 'now', 'see', 'what', 'creepy', 'dude', 'counter', 'passports', 'photos', 'out', 'Hunting', 'Club', 'members', 'where', 'bid', 'human', 'eBay.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'killer', 'who', 'be', 'Elizabeth', 'Bathory', 'who', 'first', 'American', 'victim', 'scene', 'was', 'as', 'erotic', 'was', 'terrifying.In', 'movie', 'also', 'follow', 'tracks', 'two', 'American', 'businessmen', 'who', 'travel', 'Slovakia', 'kill', 'One', 'gung-ho', 'cocaine', 'snorting', 'big', 'shot', 'who', 'other', 'meek', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'tables', 'turn', 'true', 'colors', 'show', 'when', 'men', 'are', 'alone', 'victims', 'Cokehead', 'accidently', 'head', 'hot', 'blond', 'circular', 'saw', 'then', 'part', 'leave', 'very', 'nicely', 'torn', 'apart', 'killer', 'dogs', 'elevator', 'nerd', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'psycho', 'kill', 'someone', 'can', 'not', 'kill', 'wife', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'tables', 'turn', 'once', 'again', 'rich', 'girl', 'now', 'control', 'nerd', 'boy', 'have', 'penis', 'cut', 'off', 'pair', 'scissors', 'watches', 'being', 'eaten', 'dog.Eurogirl', 'hers', 'end', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'style', 'when', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'Hell', 'set', 'up', 'rich', 'girl', 'revenge.Like', 'said', 'mystery', 'here', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'different', 'label', 'see', 'who', 'charge', 'slaughter', 'house', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'invilved']",N/A
1095107,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000UJ48OU,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","Part II of ""Hostel,"" a movie loathed by critics that is fairly respected by horror film fans, was just as hated by critics...But many fans turned on it as well. I think that ""Hostel II"" is even better than the first one. People complain that horror isn't what it used to be. It's not about atmosphere, plot, or suspense...It's about blood, gore, and naked teenagers. Essentially, this is what ""Hostel II"" is. It's not incredibly suspenseful, fairly predictable...But it makes you ask the same questions ""Saw"" made you ask. ""How are they gonna die next?"" ""Hostel II"" is a twisted, screwed-up movie and some scenes are hard to watch. The movie is really good though, so all is redeemed. It picks up right after ""Hostel"" ended. Paxton (Jay Hernandez), the only survivor of film #1, fears that he will be hunted down by the company. The company, it was revealed in the first film, is one that offers the chance to torture and murder young tourists for loads of money. Soon, the film kicks off...Three young American women (Lauren Graham, Bijou Phillips, and Heather Matazarro) who are studying in Rome are lured by a woman to a hostel, where they are all brought to their doom. This is almost exactly what it says on the back cover, but it's the only way to explain the movie. Now when this movie came out, a new term appeared: ""torture porn."" This term applies to this whole movie, but it's the first death of one of the three main characters that really makes sense out of this term. It's graphic, bloody, pornographic, and gag-worthy. One of the strong points of ""Hostel II,"" is that it also goes into more detail about the company and also introduces two characters (one played by Roger Bart, formerly of ""Desperate Housewives"") who are going to kill two of the girls and it sort of explores why people would pay money to do something like that. Oh and here's something surprising: We DO NOT see Bijou Phillips naked in this movie. Eli Roth is not the best director working in horror cinema today, but he's making a decent effort. While this film may not be what most horror fans and/or critics are looking for, because it is bloody and exploitive...But if it's your cup of tea, you will enjoy it.GRADE: A-",5,"Sick, Disgusting, and Very, Very Interesting",1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,2206,"['Part', 'II', 'Hostel', 'movie', 'loathed', 'critics', 'fairly', 'respected', 'horror', 'film', 'fans', 'was', 'just', 'hated', 'critics', 'many', 'fans', 'turned', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'Hostel', 'II', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'People', 'complain', 'horror', ""n't"", 'what', 'used', 'be', 'not', 'atmosphere', 'plot', 'suspense', 'about', 'blood', 'gore', 'naked', 'teenagers', 'Essentially', 'what', 'Hostel', 'II', 'not', 'incredibly', 'suspenseful', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'ask', 'same', 'questions', 'Saw', 'made', 'ask', 'How', 'are', 'gon', 'die', 'next', 'Hostel', 'II', 'twisted', 'screwed-up', 'movie', 'scenes', 'are', 'hard', 'watch', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'though', 'redeemed', 'up', 'right', 'Hostel', 'ended', 'Paxton', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'only', 'survivor', 'film', '1', 'fears', 'will', 'be', 'hunted', 'down', 'company', 'company', 'was', 'revealed', 'first', 'film', 'one', 'chance', 'torture', 'murder', 'young', 'tourists', 'loads', 'money', 'Soon', 'film', 'off', 'Three', 'young', 'American', 'women', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'Heather', 'Matazarro', 'who', 'are', 'studying', 'Rome', 'are', 'lured', 'woman', 'hostel', 'where', 'are', 'brought', 'doom', 'almost', 'exactly', 'what', 'back', 'cover', 'only', 'way', 'explain', 'movie', 'Now', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'new', 'term', 'appeared', 'torture', 'porn', 'term', 'whole', 'movie', 'first', 'death', 'one', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'really', 'sense', 'term', 'graphic', 'bloody', 'pornographic', 'gag-worthy', 'One', 'strong', 'points', 'Hostel', 'II', 'also', 'more', 'detail', 'company', 'also', 'introduces', 'two', 'characters', 'one', 'played', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'formerly', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'kill', 'two', 'girls', 'sort', 'explores', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'pay', 'money', 'do', 'something', 'Oh', 'here', 'something', 'surprising', 'DO', 'NOT', 'see', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'naked', 'movie', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'not', 'best', 'director', 'working', 'horror', 'cinema', 'today', 'making', 'decent', 'effort', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'most', 'horror', 'fans', 'critics', 'are', 'looking', 'bloody', 'exploitive', 'cup', 'tea', 'will', 'enjoy', 'it.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

This is an opinion of course, but there was nothing impressive about the first Hostel. It was balls to the wall blood and gore. It was filled with so much back to back disgusting images that made you cringe, but it lacked any real storyline or substance. It was like lukewarm water. I think the second installment has more of a storyline. Of course, it's predictable because we have seen this the first time around. I think they wanted to show you more about the organization. They wanted to show you that these were regular everyday people with families and normal jobs. On the other side, they also have a thirst for blood, a need to commit murder, and it's something that they are willing to pay very well to do. I found it amazing at how they were auctioning off the right to slaughter human beings like they were bidding on some concert tickets on Ebay. In my own opinion, I think the torture scenes were done with more finesse this time around (I don't know if people will quite get what I mean by that). Personally, I thought the scene with the naked woman slicing away at this innocent girl who's strung up like a chicken while bathing in her blood was meant to be sick, yet sensual, and somewhat erotic. I liked it! I also loved it when Bijou Phillips took the saw to the skull...beautiful! I also liked the ending where the hunted became the hunter, and ultimately turned the tables on this sick individual. That just goes to show money talks no matter what. Let's not forget the casteration scene...OMG CLASSIC! I know there isn't a woman alive that hasn't wanted to do that to an @ssh)le or two in their day. BRAVO! That part was..SIMPLY BRILLIANT! Lauren German has made a new fan out of me just based on that one scene alone. Not to mention, that made it worth the price of admission. I think ultimately what makes this movie work is the fact that it has so much more going for it than the first Hostel. Then again, I guess it just a matter of taste, and the first film left a bad taste in my mouth.

1095111,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000UJ48OU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 8]","I went to go see ""Hostel: Part II"" in the theater because I was interested in seeing what it would be like to watch one of these torture/horror films in a situation where you cannot push the pause or stop button on your remote.  I had only seen ""Hostel,"" ""Wolf Creek,"" and other examples of this particularly grizzly little splatter flick genre at home and I do not think the experience is ever as intense.  The only horror films I have seen in theaters in recent years have been the ""Saw"" trilogy, and as bloody and gory as those get they are really not the same genre as what you have with this film.  However, it turns out my little experiment was doomed to failure because Eli Roth's sequel is certainly not ""worse"" than the original in terms of the scenes of torture and killing, which should be a major disappointment to fans of the first because there is nothing here to rival it.This perception is colored somewhat by the fact that in addition to things being more gruesome in the original there was the underlying question of what the hell was going on that added to the horror.  That element is removed in the sequel because we know immediately when the ""recruiter"" for the hostel shows up to lure the victims to their respective fates.  This time instead of three guys it is three gals: Beth (Lauren German, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") is the good girl, Whiteny (Bijou Phillips, ""Havoc"") is the bad girl, and Lorna (Heather Matarazzo, ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" is the weird girl.  They start off in Rome but quickly make their way to Slovakia.  Of course the second time around we know what is going on, so this time Roth shows us the other half of the story, with rich people bidding on the girls to win the right to the kill and laying out the key elements of the all-important contract that the winners have to sign before they get to have their fun.  The focus is on a pair of Americans, the over excited Todd (Richard Burgi) and his more reticent friend Stuart (Roger Bart).  We also get to meet the man who is running the whole operation.After seeing this movie I have had to rethink what happened in the first one because it now appears clear that Roth is more interested in the twists that the terror, because I now consider that to be the biggest common denominator between the two films.  Again, if you come for the blood and gore, you are probably going to be quite disappointed, because Roth is more interested in surprising you with what is really going on than getting you to consider losing your popcorn.  I caught Roth in a television interview where the talking head asking the questions literally gave away the final scene of the movie, and the writer-director was talking about the political sub-text of this film as having to do with why the rest of the world hates Americans.  After all, the Americans are boring and unimaginative amateurs compared to the Europeans who clearly have developed a taste for these blood baths.  The victims are not required to be much more than victims, somewhat culpable in their own deaths, but that does not strike me as being primarily because they are American girls.I did like the ""twist"" at the end, because it appeals to both my sense of justice and my love of irony.  However, the set up was not really elegant and the element of complete surprise, so important to the original, ends up getting lost.  I mean, come on, when you get a hold of passports to copy the photos and send them around the world to your potential clients how hard is it to do a quick check to make sure you are not causing yourself problems?  Plus there have to be easier ways to get the girls to the factory.  Then there is the cinematic commonplace of the bad guys talking rather than shooting at the critical moment and how quickly the movie gets to the end credits once the twist is revealed.  Also, it seems to me that the bidding for these victims was rather low, but then clearly I place a higher value on human life than the characters in this film (hard not to).Actually, the scariest thing when I saw this film in the theater were the guys behind me who declared the heroine to be a ""bitch"" because she would not let her friend go off with some strange guy when she was falling down drunk.  I worry about guys who would think that was the most upsetting part of the movie, especially since buying some six packs or spiking a girl's drink with Rohypnol to get ""lucky"" happens in the real world even if paying thousands of dollars to torture and kill them for fun is only something that happens in movies and their less than satisfying sequels.  I suppose the urge to turn this into a trilogy will be irresistible, but I will not make the same mistake twice.  Instead I will find a whole bunch of new mistakes to make and will wait to see the next one on DVD, which is how you should see this one.",3,"""Hostel: Part II"" will disappoint anyone looking for more of the same",1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,4853,"['went', 'go', 'see', 'Hostel', 'Part', 'II', 'theater', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'watch', 'one', 'torture/horror', 'films', 'situation', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'push', 'pause', 'stop', 'button', 'remote', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'Hostel', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'other', 'examples', 'particularly', 'grizzly', 'little', 'splatter', 'flick', 'genre', 'home', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'experience', 'ever', 'intense', 'only', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'theaters', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'Saw', 'trilogy', 'bloody', 'gory', 'get', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'same', 'genre', 'what', 'have', 'film', 'However', 'out', 'little', 'experiment', 'was', 'doomed', 'failure', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'sequel', 'certainly', 'not', 'worse', 'original', 'terms', 'scenes', 'torture', 'killing', 'should', 'be', 'major', 'disappointment', 'fans', 'first', 'nothing', 'here', 'rival', 'it.This', 'perception', 'colored', 'somewhat', 'fact', 'addition', 'things', 'being', 'more', 'gruesome', 'original', 'was', 'underlying', 'question', 'what', 'hell', 'was', 'going', 'added', 'horror', 'element', 'removed', 'sequel', 'know', 'immediately', 'when', 'recruiter', 'hostel', 'up', 'lure', 'victims', 'respective', 'fates', 'time', 'instead', 'three', 'guys', 'three', 'gals', 'Beth', 'Lauren', 'German', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'good', 'girl', 'Whiteny', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'Havoc', 'bad', 'girl', 'Lorna', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'weird', 'girl', 'start', 'Rome', 'quickly', 'make', 'way', 'Slovakia', 'course', 'second', 'time', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'time', 'Roth', 'other', 'half', 'story', 'rich', 'people', 'bidding', 'girls', 'win', 'right', 'kill', 'laying', 'out', 'key', 'elements', 'all-important', 'contract', 'winners', 'have', 'sign', 'get', 'have', 'fun', 'focus', 'pair', 'Americans', 'over', 'excited', 'Todd', 'Richard', 'Burgi', 'more', 'reticent', 'friend', 'Stuart', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'also', 'get', 'meet', 'man', 'who', 'running', 'whole', 'operation.After', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', 'had', 'rethink', 'what', 'happened', 'first', 'one', 'now', 'clear', 'Roth', 'more', 'interested', 'twists', 'terror', 'now', 'consider', 'be', 'biggest', 'common', 'denominator', 'two', 'films', 'Again', 'come', 'blood', 'gore', 'are', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'Roth', 'more', 'interested', 'surprising', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'getting', 'consider', 'losing', 'popcorn', 'caught', 'Roth', 'television', 'interview', 'where', 'talking', 'head', 'asking', 'questions', 'literally', 'gave', 'away', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'writer-director', 'was', 'talking', 'political', 'sub-text', 'film', 'having', 'do', 'why', 'rest', 'world', 'Americans', 'Americans', 'are', 'boring', 'unimaginative', 'amateurs', 'compared', 'Europeans', 'who', 'clearly', 'have', 'developed', 'taste', 'blood', 'baths', 'victims', 'are', 'not', 'required', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'victims', 'somewhat', 'culpable', 'own', 'deaths', 'not', 'strike', 'being', 'primarily', 'are', 'American', 'girls.I', 'did', 'twist', 'end', 'appeals', 'sense', 'justice', 'love', 'irony', 'However', 'set', 'up', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'elegant', 'element', 'complete', 'surprise', 'so', 'important', 'original', 'up', 'getting', 'lost', 'mean', 'come', 'when', 'get', 'hold', 'passports', 'copy', 'photos', 'send', 'world', 'potential', 'clients', 'how', 'hard', 'do', 'quick', 'check', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'not', 'causing', 'problems', 'have', 'be', 'easier', 'ways', 'get', 'girls', 'factory', 'Then', 'cinematic', 'commonplace', 'bad', 'guys', 'talking', 'rather', 'shooting', 'critical', 'moment', 'how', 'quickly', 'movie', 'end', 'once', 'twist', 'revealed', 'Also', 'bidding', 'victims', 'was', 'rather', 'low', 'then', 'clearly', 'place', 'higher', 'value', 'human', 'life', 'characters', 'film', 'hard', 'not', '.Actually', 'scariest', 'thing', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'were', 'guys', 'who', 'declared', 'heroine', 'be', 'bitch', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'friend', 'go', 'off', 'strange', 'guy', 'when', 'was', 'falling', 'down', 'drunk', 'worry', 'guys', 'who', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'most', 'upsetting', 'part', 'movie', 'especially', 'buying', 'six', 'packs', 'spiking', 'girl', 'drink', 'Rohypnol', 'get', 'lucky', 'real', 'world', 'even', 'paying', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'torture', 'kill', 'fun', 'only', 'something', 'movies', 'less', 'satisfying', 'sequels', 'suppose', 'urge', 'turn', 'trilogy', 'will', 'be', 'irresistible', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'twice', 'Instead', 'will', 'find', 'whole', 'bunch', 'new', 'mistakes', 'make', 'will', 'wait', 'see', 'next', 'one', 'DVD', 'how', 'should', 'see', 'one']",N/A

Few things made me feel as good as watching the internet-leaked workprint of this dud before I blindly went to waste my money on it in theaters.

1095116,A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B000UJ48OU,Marcel Lee,"[0, 0]","Perhaps I'm a little ""sick"". I think it's morally wrong to torture and kill people for no justifiable reason, but I can understand, and even relate to, the desire to do it, especially when the victim is a girl who's as sexually attractive as actress Lauren German. She plays a wealthy art student named Beth, who, along with two of her female classmates and the model girl they were assigned to draw, decide to take a train to Slovakia for a little ""spa"" vacation. That is, of course, where the danger begins, and eventually one of the girls is hanging upside down from a ceiling, dripping sweat and gushing blood.That scene; an extreme display of lesbian sadism; is a turn-on. I guess that's where it goes back to me being a little sick. I'm not a sadist in that I'd ever do what these Hostel clients do; pay money to get their rocks off by torturing and killing innocent people. But it can be a thrill to watch. And I guess that's the point of this movie; a Part 2 that is a lot more entertaining than its predecessor, partially because all the main victims are cute girls but mostly because director Eli Roth; no doubt inspired by mentor Quentin Tarantino; manages to provide an engaging, and sometimes surprisingly suspenseful, plot.It's not quite a good movie. I think the individual parts are better than the whole. The beginning; an epilogue sort of prelude; is unnecessary. And the ending, in which one of the girls starts behaving in a way that seems to totally go against her character; the set-up to another sequel; is just plain silly. But it's a movie I'd nonetheless recommend to anyone's who's into bloody horror flicks and has already had the displeasure of sitting thru the first Hostel, or anyone who gets a psychological rush from the sights and sounds of girls screaming and crying and wiggling around in physical anguish.marcellee.com",3,3 of 5,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,1855,"['Perhaps', ""'m"", 'little', 'sick', 'think', 'morally', 'wrong', 'torture', 'kill', 'people', 'justifiable', 'reason', 'can', 'understand', 'even', 'relate', 'desire', 'do', 'especially', 'when', 'victim', 'girl', 'who', 'sexually', 'attractive', 'actress', 'Lauren', 'German', 'wealthy', 'art', 'student', 'named', 'Beth', 'who', 'two', 'female', 'classmates', 'model', 'girl', 'were', 'assigned', 'draw', 'decide', 'take', 'train', 'Slovakia', 'little', 'spa', 'vacation', 'course', 'where', 'danger', 'eventually', 'one', 'girls', 'hanging', 'upside', 'down', 'ceiling', 'dripping', 'sweat', 'gushing', 'blood.That', 'scene', 'extreme', 'display', 'lesbian', 'sadism', 'turn-on', 'guess', 'where', 'back', 'being', 'little', 'sick', ""'m"", 'not', 'sadist', ""'d"", 'ever', 'do', 'what', 'Hostel', 'clients', 'do', 'pay', 'money', 'get', 'rocks', 'off', 'torturing', 'killing', 'innocent', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'thrill', 'watch', 'guess', 'point', 'movie', 'Part', '2', 'lot', 'more', 'entertaining', 'predecessor', 'partially', 'main', 'victims', 'are', 'cute', 'girls', 'mostly', 'director', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'doubt', 'inspired', 'mentor', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'provide', 'engaging', 'sometimes', 'surprisingly', 'suspenseful', 'plot.It', 'not', 'quite', 'good', 'movie', 'think', 'individual', 'parts', 'are', 'better', 'whole', 'beginning', 'epilogue', 'sort', 'prelude', 'unnecessary', 'ending', 'one', 'girls', 'behaving', 'way', 'totally', 'go', 'character', 'set-up', 'sequel', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'movie', ""'d"", 'nonetheless', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'bloody', 'horror', 'flicks', 'already', 'had', 'displeasure', 'sitting', 'first', 'Hostel', 'anyone', 'who', 'psychological', 'rush', 'sights', 'sounds', 'girls', 'screaming', 'crying', 'wiggling', 'around', 'physical', 'anguish.marcellee.com']",N/A
1095117,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000UJ48OU,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[8, 14]","The most obvious difference between this film and its predecessor is that instead of three fellows facing off against the Slovakian ""hunting club,"" we now have three gals:  the wealthy Beth (Lauren German), the socially stunted Lorna (Heather Matarazzo), and slutty Whitney (Bijou Phillips, or as I like to call her, The Forehead).Hostel wasn't just a sweaty-palmed gore-fest with an aura of believability to its sadism.  It was also a rather clever (if not heavy-handed) jab at the whole idea of exploitation.  Three backpackers roll like over-fed sows in the cultural trough of an ethically lax and economically crippled Europe, getting wasted and trying to score hot foreign chicks.  When that fails, they buy their hot foreign chicks at the Red Light District.  Irony of ironies, they find out that their flesh is also for sale.That sort of grim self-reflection is missing in the sequel, which has less to do with courage, redemption, and missing limbs than it does with backstory.  Most of this installment explains the workings of The Organization, giving the audience a closer look at the men (and women) who pay for the right to kill, and the steps (fiduciary as well as mental) that they must go through to get that priveledge.  It's an interesting take on an interesting idea, but it collapses as soon as the movie realizes that very few people want to actually sympathize with people who have this much blood on the brain.Speaking of which.  Even gore-hungry viewers who couldn't care less about ironic meanings and subtle symbols will not be sated by this go-around, either.  Forget suspense, tension, or creative carnage.  With the exception of one obscenely graphic moment that will make every man in the theater cross his legs and cringe, this installment falls far short of its big brother in the blood and guts department.Perhaps Roth was playing to the minds and the pockets that made the first ""Hostel"" such a success, relying on his already-established mythos to provide the token eeriness and appeal.  In some ways, this is admirable -- two rich American businessmen get a good look at their own hearts when they are offered the chance to rip out someone else's.  (As one of them, actor Richard Burgi plays the moment with perfectly precise and horrific grace (even if, for most of the movie, I kept picturing him in his role as the ""breathtaking"" doctor from Seinfeld.)  In other ways, it's repetitive and boring (soooooo many chase scenes).What consolations the movie does offer are far too fine and fleeting, especially for a film that has such a meaty reputation to live up to.  Most of the expected elements are here -- ultra dark comedy, the Bubblegum Kids, gratuitous nudity, people screaming -- but the movie is missing perhaps the most important element of all: guts.In every definition of the word.",2,Tortured To Death,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,2829,"['most', 'obvious', 'difference', 'film', 'predecessor', 'instead', 'three', 'fellows', 'facing', 'off', 'Slovakian', 'hunting', 'club', 'now', 'have', 'three', 'gals', 'wealthy', 'Beth', 'Lauren', 'German', 'socially', 'stunted', 'Lorna', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'slutty', 'Whitney', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'like', 'call', 'Forehead', '.Hostel', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'sweaty-palmed', 'gore-fest', 'aura', 'believability', 'sadism', 'was', 'also', 'rather', 'clever', 'not', 'heavy-handed', 'jab', 'whole', 'idea', 'exploitation', 'Three', 'backpackers', 'roll', 'over-fed', 'sows', 'cultural', 'trough', 'ethically', 'lax', 'economically', 'crippled', 'Europe', 'getting', 'wasted', 'trying', 'score', 'hot', 'foreign', 'chicks', 'When', 'buy', 'hot', 'foreign', 'chicks', 'Red', 'Light', 'District', 'Irony', 'ironies', 'find', 'out', 'flesh', 'also', 'sale.That', 'sort', 'grim', 'self-reflection', 'missing', 'sequel', 'less', 'do', 'courage', 'redemption', 'missing', 'limbs', 'backstory', 'Most', 'installment', 'workings', 'Organization', 'giving', 'audience', 'closer', 'look', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'pay', 'right', 'kill', 'steps', 'fiduciary', 'as', 'well', 'mental', 'must', 'go', 'get', 'priveledge', 'interesting', 'take', 'interesting', 'idea', 'as', 'soon', 'movie', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'want', 'actually', 'sympathize', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'much', 'blood', 'brain.Speaking', 'Even', 'gore-hungry', 'viewers', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'ironic', 'meanings', 'subtle', 'symbols', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'sated', 'go-around', 'either', 'Forget', 'suspense', 'tension', 'creative', 'carnage', 'exception', 'one', 'obscenely', 'graphic', 'moment', 'will', 'make', 'man', 'theater', 'cross', 'legs', 'cringe', 'installment', 'far', 'short', 'big', 'brother', 'blood', 'guts', 'department.Perhaps', 'Roth', 'was', 'playing', 'minds', 'pockets', 'made', 'first', 'Hostel', 'such', 'success', 'relying', 'already-established', 'mythos', 'provide', 'token', 'eeriness', 'appeal', 'ways', 'admirable', 'two', 'rich', 'American', 'businessmen', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'own', 'hearts', 'when', 'are', 'offered', 'chance', 'rip', 'out', 'someone', 'else', 'one', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Burgi', 'moment', 'perfectly', 'precise', 'horrific', 'grace', 'even', 'most', 'movie', 'kept', 'picturing', 'role', 'breathtaking', 'doctor', 'Seinfeld', 'other', 'ways', 'repetitive', 'boring', 'soooooo', 'many', 'chase', 'scenes', 'movie', 'offer', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'fine', 'fleeting', 'especially', 'film', 'meaty', 'reputation', 'live', 'up', 'Most', 'expected', 'elements', 'are', 'here', 'ultra', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Bubblegum', 'Kids', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'people', 'screaming', 'movie', 'missing', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'element', 'guts.In', 'definition', 'word']",N/A

I was hoping to get the same effect from the second one and I was very disappointed. The writer was tied too much up into the stories of both parties, the victim and the buyer. I did watch the deleted scenes and there the director stated that he cut them because ""it made the pace slow"". Sorry, it didn't slow the pace, it explained the ""dragging on of the story"" that he was trying to accomplish. I don't want to make this a whine fest, but I also have some other complaints about the sequel. I don't have a problem with nudity. In fact I enjoy seeing nudity because it makes the characters more real, but the nudity should be equal between both sexes. In the deleted scenes the director stated that his ""female hostel fans"" protested to so much female nudity in the orginal. Yes, I do agree with them with this one. What should have happened is the director would have put in more male nudity. In the opening scene there is a male nude model for the art students. This was shown for about 2 seconds then the teachers head was put over the pelvic area of the models when she is walking. Then the director cut the scene of what the artist had painted. How lame is that? It most certainly looked like the director failed at what he was trying to do and ""equalized"" nothing. At least in the first movie there was more shots of men without shirts than this one. What I did like about the movie is that there were some ""imaginative"" ways that the ""victims"" were killed. There were also some very good twists in the story. I do recommend this movie to the ""avid Hostel fans"" but hopefully in the next one the director doesn't get ""tied up in quickening the pace"", make some of the ""story"" victims both male and female and leave out the ""stories of the buyers"".",3,Sequel is not as good as the first,1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,1805,"['saw', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'terrifying', 'was', 'hoping', 'get', 'same', 'effect', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'writer', 'was', 'tied', 'too', 'much', 'stories', 'parties', 'victim', 'buyer', 'did', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'stated', 'cut', 'made', 'pace', 'slow', 'Sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'slow', 'pace', 'explained', 'dragging', 'story', 'was', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'whine', 'fest', 'also', 'have', 'other', 'complaints', 'sequel', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'nudity', 'fact', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'nudity', 'characters', 'more', 'real', 'nudity', 'should', 'be', 'equal', 'sexes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'stated', 'female', 'hostel', 'fans', 'protested', 'so', 'much', 'female', 'nudity', 'orginal', 'Yes', 'do', 'agree', 'one', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'happened', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'more', 'male', 'nudity', 'opening', 'scene', 'male', 'nude', 'model', 'art', 'students', 'was', 'shown', 'about', '2', 'seconds', 'then', 'teachers', 'head', 'was', 'put', 'over', 'pelvic', 'area', 'models', 'when', 'walking', 'Then', 'director', 'cut', 'scene', 'what', 'artist', 'had', 'painted', 'How', 'lame', 'most', 'certainly', 'looked', 'director', 'failed', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'equalized', 'nothing', 'least', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'shots', 'men', 'shirts', 'one', 'What', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'were', 'imaginative', 'ways', 'victims', 'were', 'killed', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'twists', 'story', 'do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'avid', 'Hostel', 'fans', 'hopefully', 'next', 'one', 'director', ""n't"", 'get', 'tied', 'up', 'quickening', 'pace', 'make', 'story', 'victims', 'male', 'female', 'leave', 'out', 'stories', 'buyers']",N/A

Hostel was one of those unique movies. The idea of tourist on vacation being kidnapped, and becoming victims of an underground elite killing club is enough to make you think twice. The idea alone is what makes the movie interesting. A bunch of people traveling carelessly on vacation, then all of a sudden find themselves in a place they'd rather not be. I love the concept of it all. Hostel 1 kind of dragged on a bit longer than it should have, but the twist in the story salvaged it.Now here is my problem with Hostel 2. The movie makes seeing the first one absolutely pointless. It takes the original movie and defecates all over it.**(spoiler coming)** I have no idea who thought it was a good idea to kill the main character that survived from hostel 1 in the beginning. You don't do that! You don't make an entire movie about one man surviving it all then kill him to start off a sequel! That's just wrong. Imagine if you just finished watching die hard, then you picked up die hard 2, and after watch Bruce taking names and kicking ass all through die hard 1 for 2hours they kill him off in the first 5 minutes of die hard 2 after he is ran over by an elderly woman while he crossing a street. There lies the bad ass action hero who killed 30 terrorist by himself now dead after a hit and run accident. Yes that is the perfect way to start a sequel folks...kill your main character.When I saw them kill of the surviving character form Hostel 1 I knew this movie was going to be a s**t storm, and it was. Already knowing the plot from the first movie what could they possibly do to make the movie seem fresh and new? Well this time instead of guys they added girls. The same typical girl group they use in EVERY movie. The nerdy girl, the party/slutty girl, and the conservative chick. Yes, finally a group I haven't seen before and completely unpredicatable! YES!.....NO! you could probably tell exactly what's going to happen to all of them as soon as you see them. The girls are traveling in Italy, they meet some Model who befriends them. The Model takes them to a town to relax, and you already know the rest. The only twist in this one is that the girl captured turns out to be billgates daughter and buys her freedom, and then becomes a member of the club herself. Suprise! That's the end of the movie. It's bland, and nothing worth talking about. From a guy that enjoys watching B horror films this doesn't even make the grade as a C grade horror film.

1095123,AN8M401S8Y6DA,B000UJ48OU,Mike Liddell,"[17, 25]","Romero's Dawn of the Dead symbolized American's consumerism turning us into zombies and here Roth uses consumerism and our e bay addicted society to turn us into monsters.  The cool part about George A. Romero's great classic is that it's poking fun at our society and were not actually going to turn into zombies.  Hostel Part II goes right for the jugular, or some other private area in the most brutal and realistic castration scene since Cannibal Holocaust.  The film asks the question could this really happen?  In the age of the internet where everything is available at our fingertips and perhaps what shocks you today you'll be far to desensitized to be effected by in time.  Basically Hostel II is a brutal horror film wrapped in that same message a classic like Dawn of the Dead had without using satire or subtly it reflects the ugly side of mankind where as the Wu Tang Clan said C.R.E.A.M (cash rules everything around me).As I said the film is far superior to the original and takes off literally where the first one left off.  This time we have three female college students, who are led astray by another girl they meet and end up at a spa in Slovakia.  As soon as they arrive at the Hostel the online bidding begins all over the globe to see who gets each girl.  There are twists and turns and it is not your typical torture porn.  There is a plot, we have effective character development; meaning we actually like some of the girls and care if something happens, and there are actually no kills for the first forty minutes.  The villains in this movie look like me and you.  As they make there descent down the elevator to do their horrible deeds they act as if they are gladiators and it angers us because gladiators did battle in an arena and didn't kill someone that was tied up.A lot of criticism for this film will come for the simple fact that it's a new movie and doesn't have the benefit of other films now considered classics that were probably hated upon in their initial release as well.The mere hatred for the film reflects America's hypocrisies as well that people are so angry about entertainment yet if you turned on the news it's far worse then Hostel I or II combined; are the same people writing letters and participating in sit ins?The dvd quality was great and rivaled some Hd dvds I've seen and the soundtrack was equally amazing I had to keep my receiver about 6-8 decibles lower than usual for the same effect.I wasn't a big fan of Hostel I although I didn't hate it and if you read any of my lists to see my tastes I'm really not into the goriest horror.  A lot of my favorites include Jacques Tourneur's Night of the Demon, Something Wicked This Way Comes, Kwaidan, Nosferatu (1922), The Exorcist, Wolfen, The Shining, Misery, Don't Look Now, Night of The Hunter, Halloween, Fall of the House of Usher (epstein), To name serveral, to give you an idea of my likes.I don't think we live in a dreadful society with no hope, however this is a horror film and does reflect mans ugly side and if you look at the news we do have an ugly side.

It's almost indistinguishable from DVD quality except in a few rare cases of very high-speed camera pans where it is just a little staggered.  The quality of this movie is no different, and the contrast of the dark settings is outstanding on Unbox.Unfortunately that technology is wasted on Hostel Part 2.  I like Roth's film ""Cabin Fever"".  It was a creative film with a gritty plot line and a creative use of special effects.  Hostel Part 2 really boils down to nothing more than ""how creative can we be about torture"" and ""how stupid and obvious can we make the ending"".  I decided to see the movie because Eli Roth's promotion of the movie when it was realeased talked about the incredible ending.  I love a good twist ending (""The Prestige"" was one of my favorites for good endings), but this one was way too obvious.  I won't spoil it, but it's not even worth the $4 rental fee.The attempted creative use of torture winds up losing all creativity.  It is obvious that the writers and directors were trying to be clever, but all you wind up seeing is their attempted cleverness regardless of the fact that it adds nothing to the plot.If you want a good horror movie, try the remake of Halloween, 28 Weeks Later, or even Saw 4 (not the best, but at least it has a plot...).

1095126,A3HOGE326DO4NC,B000UJ48OU,M. Nelson,"[2, 3]","I'll admit it: I liked this film... a LOT. Perhaps my expectations were somewhat diminished by the fact that I knew this was essentially a prequel sequel before I ever took a seat. Regardless, when Roth's at the helm, you know what's coming (buckets o' blood and torture galore) and you know it'll be done to grisly perfection.Unlike the original, there's no need for time consuming character development or pulse slowing set-up. This one cuts right to the killing (and cut does it ever).The film itself is backstory shedding light on the tattooed sadists we met in the first Hostel and opening the doors to the secret society/for profit torture emporium of which they become a part. Interestingly, this adds an element of ""scare"" I felt was largely absent the first go round. Yes, numero uno was gross and disgusting, but it was so ridiculous I was half-laughing my way to the credit roll.Hostel II, while still absurd, draws enough parallels to the secret organizations so many conspiracy theorists aim to warn us about today, one can't help but bit a little creeped out. Seriously, if the Illuminati aren't getting together to play Parchisi, what are they up to? And when was the last time you saw a Freemason with a trowel in hand? I rest my case.Sure, it's not the next Shakespeare in Love, but would you want to watch it if it was?If you liked the first Hostel and the cheesy '70s gore to which it paid homage, you're going to enjoy this film.

1095129,A1FY6ETS4ZPCUE,B000UJ48OU,Mr. Mambo,"[5, 6]","I only watched a few minutes of this movie; it was on TV and I came upon it. Because of that, I cannot give a totally fair review, but I do have a comment or two. A few years ago, a first ""Hostel"" was made, which I avoided--and it must have done well at the box office, so here we have a sequel, or continuation. I see that there is also a ""Hostel III"", so....who knows how long this will go on? After all, they are up to about #6 for ""Saw"", correct?).We give the people want they want, but if this is what they want, what does that say about them?I am a grandfather, I'm not a prude or religious fanatic, and I've seen thousands and thousands of movies in my time. And I appreciate a good horror film, one which frightens me and surprises me (the two go hand-in-hand). I am sure that I am much older than the average person who 'likes' ""Hostel"" and its ilk, and so that probably has a lot to do with it. I thought the first ""Halloween"" was a damn good and very frightening horror film, because it was smart, subtle and suspenseful, and did not rely upon buckets of gore in a misguided attempt to frighten us. The original ""Night of the Living Dead"" was pretty gory, and the opposite of subtle, but the nightmarish, crude, high contrast B/W images helped tone it down, and the whole premise and execution of the film was extremely frightening. I believe that less talented filmmakers saw the success of those two landmarks of the horror genre, tried to cash in it, but took the easy way out, and upped the gore/violence quotient, in lieu of story or dialogue or restraint or mood. Thus we had the Nightmare on Elm Streets, the even more inferior Friday the 13th's, and the interminable remakes of the Texas Chainsaw Massacres.The entire premise of ""Hostel II"" is extremely disturbing: there are wealthy but very sick and twisted people who put up thousands of dollars in online bidding wars, with the winner having the right to torture and kill a particular young girl. These girls are innocent tourists who've happened to check into the wrong ""hostel"". Passport photos are surreptitiously scanned and sent worldwide to a host of these rich freaks, men and women alike, and the bidding escalates. We are 'treated' to the girls' kidnapping and torture and very few punches are pulled. Call me crazy, but haven't we crossed a line here? To me this is very dangerous territory, for many reasons.First of all, it suggests that, if you have enough money, you can literally buy anyone and do anything to them you want. And secondly, the truly scary thing is that there probably ARE real monsters in the world who might be interested in doing this to people.But really, and most importantly, how can anyone be 'entertained' by this? Scenes of torture? Are you kidding me? Why would anyone want to watch this stuff? I did not last until the end, so maybe some of the creeps do get their just desserts, which would help things, I guess. But even so, I don't want to wade through all this monstrous and disgusting behavior just to see some creep get wasted.Somewhere we've gone off the rails. To me films like these are a kind of violent, sadistic pornography. Used to be that good old sex and nudity would do it for us, but now we seem to want to watch the girls get carved up too, the more blood the better! Porn is a 'progressive' thing; what floats your boat today quickly becomes pedestrian, and you need to amp things up. It reminds one of ancient Rome, where the wealthier they got, the more jaded and depraved they became. By the end the patricians were digging scenes of people getting torn apart by lions. Eventually the Empire rotted away from within. Is that happening to us? Again, I am not a conservative Republican or religious fanatic! I'm just asking.Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" really crossed some lines when it came out in 1960. For one thing, we'd never had a main character get killed only twenty minutes or so into the film! But among the many things that made this film a classic is the restrained and artful editing of that ground-breaking, legendary shower scene. To be fair, the heavy hand of the censorship board kept Hitch in check--he would have loved to show more blood and more skin--but we don't need to see any more! We know what is happening. BECAUSE we don't see that much makes it all the more frightening to us. Less IS more!It's an interesting concept that should be revisited.To sum up, strapping people down on tables and eviscerating them,...burning them,...shocking them with electrodes,...cutting off their limbs,...flaying them and watching the blood flow is not frightening; it is disgusting, degrading, and deadening. There is a difference. Modern filmmakers and audiences seem to have forgotten this concept. And don't tell me that 'it's only a movie!, as if that tired old line is actually a legitimate excuse. If you can actually say you enjoy watching this stuff, then your soul is on its way to death, and I truly feel sorry for you.I am more frightened by the fact that so many people choose to see movies like this, than by the movies themselves.I worry about our future.",1,What Has Happened To Us?,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,5107,"['only', 'watched', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'TV', 'came',

1095130,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000UJ48OU,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[20, 36]","Eli Roth needs to know when to stop.  Hostel: Part II takes the promising set up of his first film and just runs it into the ground with predictability and inaneness.  The film picks up with survivor Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and what he's been up to since the events of the first film, and eventually leads to a trio of girls (Lauren German, Heather Matazarro, and Bijou Philips) that run afoul of the same crew of sadists from the first film.  This time around however, Roth shows us the inside of the organization that preys upon people and uses them as torture victims (one of which, played with excellent creepiness by veteran TV actor Richard Burgi), and this is where Hostel II fails the most.  Roth makes a shallow attempt to get into their heads and ultimately fails, and fails even more so as we get to know the three female leads.  We don't care one bit for the characters or what happens to them, where as at least we did a little bit the first time around when Paxton and his friends ran into trouble.  It is also worth noting that the gore effects are especially grisly and this will be the only reason to check out the Unrated version of the film (if you saw the film in theaters, you were probably wondering just what couldn't make it into the R-rated cut).  Eli Roth has so much potential in becoming one of the next, best directors of the horror genre, but his talent gets wasted here, and hopefully he'll realize that it's time to go a different approach than the new age exploitation route.

1095140,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000UJ48OU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[30, 43]","Hostel Part II (Eli Roth,2007)The second film in the Hostel franchise is a difficult one to review, and that's pretty obvious given that reviews of the film have been split almost right down the middle. The problem is that while it's enjoyable (assuming you like that sort of thing), this is a movie that could have been so very, very much more than it was.After a quick, and morbidly amusing, stop in to see Paxton (Jay Hernandez), the sole survivor of the first film, we immediately get back to teenagers in peril. This time it's a trio of American girls, Beth (A Walk to Remember's Lauren German), Whitney (Bijou Phillips, recently of Havoc), and Lorna (Welcome to the Dollhouse's Heather Matarazzo). You know what's coming. An alternating storyline also focuses on Todd (Richard Burgi), who buys one of the girls as a present for his friend Stuart (Roger Bart; both guys normally do time on Desperate Housewives). And that's where the germs of brilliance that could have grown into a full-blown virus lie in this movie-- the idea of taking the same scenario from the original and turning it on its head, giving us the dirt from the perspective of the killers. And we do get some of that, but it's not the focus of the film. That would have been genius.The strongest point of the movie is that Roth dropped the softcore angle and went for the straight gore-- which has the effect, of course, of heightening the ugliness of scenes where sexuality does play a role. The greatest of these is truly brilliant, and displaces the infamous leg-shaving scene in Cabin Fever as the best single scene Roth has yet committed to film; you'll know it when you get to it, and it would be worth the price of admission alone. It is a profoundly discomfiting piece of filmmaking, and shows that Roth, when he brings his A game, is truly capable of being on the level of the guys he idolizes (another one of whom turns up for a brief cameo in this movie; I was floored, but no one else in the audience recognized him. Don't look at the cast list before you go, and see if you catch the cameo before the end credits).All that said, the movie is rife with inconsistencies and plot holes, but that may be by design; from the opening scene, it's obvious that Roth intended this movie as a rather vicious parody of the horror film sequel formula; if you can look at the odd lapses as satire-- and Roth's own body of work, which is usually tight as a drum, lends credence to such an interpretation-- they're forgivable. The movie also contains a surprising amount of grim humor; it's a rare thing when an otherwise straight horror film has the audience walking out of the theater laughing hysterically. If the original Hostel was Roth's take on Takashi Miike's Visitor Q, this one is Ichi the Killer. with a dose of Flower of Flesh and Blood thrown in for good measure. Roth continues his one-man quest to drag Hollywood into the same space Asian horror filmmakers have been inhabiting since the late eighties, and he's turned in a movie in service of that goal that, while not living up to its potential, remains the most fun I've had seeing a horror film on the big screen in a whole lot of years. *** ",3,"Didn't live up to its potential in any way, but still lots of fun.",1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,3183,"['Hostel', 'Part', 'II', 'Eli', 'Roth,2007', 'second', 'film', 'Hostel', 'franchise', 'difficult', 'one', 'review', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'given', 'reviews', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'split', 'almost', 'right', 'down', 'middle', 'problem', 'enjoyable', 'assuming', 'sort', 'thing', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'was.After', 'quick', 'morbidly', 'amusing', 'stop', 'see', 'Paxton', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'sole', 'survivor', 'first', 'film', 'immediately', 'get', 'back', 'teenagers', 'peril', 'time', 'trio', 'American', 'girls', 'Beth', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'Lauren', 'German', 'Whitney', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'recently', 'Havoc', 'Lorna', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'alternating', 'storyline', 'also', 'Todd', 'Richard', 'Burgi', 'who', 'one', 'girls', 'present', 'friend', 'Stuart', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'guys', 'normally', 'do', 'time', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'where', 'germs', 'brilliance', 'could', 'have', 'grown', 'full-blown', 'virus', 'lie', 'movie', 'idea', 'taking', 'same', 'scenario', 'original', 'turning', 'head', 'giving', 'dirt', 'perspective', 'killers', 'do', 'get', 'not', 'focus', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'genius.The', 'strongest', 'point', 'movie', 'Roth', 'dropped', 'softcore', 'angle', 'went', 'straight', 'gore', 'effect', 'course', 'heightening', 'ugliness', 'scenes', 'where', 'sexuality', 'play', 'role', 'greatest', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'infamous', 'leg-shaving', 'scene', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'best', 'single', 'scene', 'Roth', 'yet', 'committed', 'film', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'get', 'would', 'be', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'profoundly', 'discomfiting', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'Roth', 'when', 'A', 'game', 'truly', 'capable', 'being', 'level', 'guys', 'one', 'whom', 'up', 'brief', 'cameo', 'movie', 'was', 'floored', 'one', 'else', 'audience', 'recognized', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'cast', 'list', 'go', 'see', 'catch', 'cameo', 'end', 'credits', '.All', 'said', 'movie', 'rife', 'inconsistencies', 'plot', 'holes', 'may', 'be', 'design', 'opening', 'scene', 'obvious', 'Roth', 'intended', 'movie', 'rather', 'vicious', 'parody', 'horror', 'film', 'sequel', 'formula', 'can', 'look', 'odd', 'lapses', 'satire', 'Roth', 'own', 'body', 'work', 'usually', 'tight', 'drum', 'credence', 'interpretation', ""'re"", 'forgivable', 'movie', 'also', 'surprising', 'amount', 'grim', 'humor', 'rare', 'thing', 'when', 'otherwise', 'straight', 'horror', 'film', 'audience', 'walking', 'theater', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'original', 'Hostel', 'was', 'Roth', 'take', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'Visitor', 'Q', 'one', 'Ichi', 'Killer', 'dose', 'Flower', 'Flesh', 'Blood', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'one-man', 'quest', 'drag', 'Hollywood', 'same', 'space', 'Asian', 'horror', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'been', 'inhabiting', 'late', 'eighties', 'turned', 'movie', 'service', 'goal', 'not', 'living', 'up', 'potential', 'most', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'had', 'seeing', 'horror', 'film', 'big', 'screen', 'whole', 'lot', 'years', '***']",N/A

I was disappointed that Jay Hernandez gets killed right away, but it also it makes sense since no witnesses/survivors can be left or else the whole operation is at risk.What really put a new light in the movie were the two male characters who are new to the club. There we get to see two different characters at play, one who is eager to taste evil and one who has to be dragged into the situation. The one who is eager has fantasies of how killing somebody will make him gain a characteristic that will intimidate others, a characteristic that does not need to be mentioned yet perceptible. What he fails to consider is that the characteristic that he years for, might not come from killing an innocent and defenseless victim, or killing without need or killing out of curiosity. The other clients of the club are truly evil, they indulge in their dark pastime as the goal, for pleasure, and that is how and why they can kill not only without remorse but with pure pleasure. At the end I did feel sorry for him, very little effort was needed (even a simple matter of just sit and wait) to complete his contract and he would have survived.For Stuart, the character who has to be dragged into the situation, on the other hand, he does not want to be ""that guy"" yet slowly but surely when presented with the proper opportunities and motivations, he turns out to embrace the darkness and evil. Stuart's repressions and frustrations come to surface and he will project them into anybody who is in front of him. His transformation from the hesitant/undecided guy is extreme and very convincing. This also left me thinking about his friend, maybe his friend couldn't transform because he did not have any repressions or frustration. Being a wealthy and physically attractive man who probably got his way most of the time, there was probably very little to brew evil feelings.The transformation to evil is also extreme for the surviving girl, Beth, who turn herself into a ruthless killer, too. But at least she did have a very good reason for that. Payback is a bitch, indeed.I guess it was good for Stuart to embrace evil, the audience had to abandon any sympathy for this character for the ending to work. There was really no way out of that room without somebody murdered and had Stuart remain his old self and tried to save the girl, they both would have died.Probably what I have mentioned was not the main idea of such a movie, but it was interesting to me.",3,"ok movie, the killer characters were interesting.

The beginning of that film was what I'd call pointless drivel, up until we were exposed to a dark world and a vicious, unnerving ending. Hostel: Part II opens just as we left the ending of the first film, and there's a really interesting opening, which actually builds up a half-decent tension and shows us a bit more about the mechanics of what's happening.However, once we get into the ending, the entire thing takes a twist and goes from being nearly subtle into being more sudden, dumb and even attempts some kind of humor. What bothers me is the inconsistency - Eli Roth can't seem to deliver an entire horror film or an entire comedy from start to finish. The ""pay-off"" does not live up to the first hour of the film, it's just absurd, and a lot more disappointing than funny.This edition of the film is pretty good, at the very least decent.

In Hostel we followed male college students, in Hostel II we follow some female students who are led astray by female model, promising them the vacation of their lives.  After a strange run in on a train, they are invited to a big party where one of their numbers immediately goes missing.  Searching for their missing companion, the rest fall into terrible peril at the hands of the men who have paid to kill them in any way they wish to do.I think what makes Hostel II weak is the fact that they chose to delve into the personalities and identities of the men (and women) who are the clients, the ones who pay to do the killing.  It seemed more sinister when the clients were left as a mystery.  Hostel II showed their weaknesses and not the nature of them that leads them to sign up for something so sinister as a trouble free murder.  The plot is much thinner than in the first movie.The ending to Hostel II is its strong point, but I can't give away too much of that.  Suffice to say it has a good feeling, though again it doesn't compare to the ending of the first Hostel movie.  Overall, I would rate the first Hostel as a purchase and Hostel II as a rental, if you're interested.  There is some gore and a few tense scenes, but it seemed more ""forced"" than the first movie.

You deserve my derisive pity because all of you manifest implicated signs of severe damage in your souls, minds, and spirits by actually patronizing this inhumanly cruel, violent, lascivious and debauched film. I want to lecture all of Hostel 2's fans that this film is not, I repeat, NOT possessing any meritable or redemptive qualities.It doesn't even qualify as a legitimate horror film because the better horror films, normally, have things called suspense, psychological elements and fear induced via suggestion. Hostel and its ilk of shock-horror films are nothing but the equivalence of violence-porn where the hook in these films is they're supposed to get people off who sadistically enjoy scenes of torture and sexual cruelty.The imitative ""premise""--Hostel 2's so absurd and twisted that there really is no premise--is that female travelers are preyed upon by an underground organization of ""closet"" sadists!!!! These sadists' goons capture these women and subject them to the most abysmal maltreatment that persons could perpetrate on one another. With this graphically raw and sick description of the ""plot""--again, Hostel's 2 so ferociously violent that it's ludicrous to attribute a plot to it--it's clear Hostel 2 frighteningly mirrors the real-life crimes of sadistic serial killers such as John Wayne Gacy, Jeff Dahmer, Ed Gein, etc..This film is a glorification and a hawking of unhealthy, psychological illnesses and personality disorders such as sexual sadism and sadomasochism. The field of psychology even has a mortifying term for the kinds of people who watch, enjoy and get off on Hostel 2: sadists and sadomasochists, both of whom are stigmatized as suffering paraphillia, or, simply, sexual deviation!!!!To prove my thesis that Hostel 2 is exclusively made for the above-mentioned people suffering from pathology, I'll go into raw, graphic and unsettling detail of what's on this Hostel 2 DVD since every, single Hostel 2 apologist is tactically concealing the ruinous depravity of the film. They deviously conceal said depravity since they know no right-thinking person is going to believe their absurd crock about Hostel 2 being a film worthy of five stars.Because I'm such a noble man, I offered up my own psychological well-being by watching Hostel 2 so that I could expose all its vileness, expose the apologists of this destructive toxicity, and, most importantly, warn others NOT TO WATCH it!!!!Hostel 2's a real sadomasochistic/sexually sadistic enormity that sex and violence are relentlessly combined to shock the audience.Take the part where there's a woman, nude, strung up by her feet. Another woman enters, disrobing and showing full, frontal nakedness as she lies down beneath the first woman. The second woman produces a scythe and heartlessly cuts into the strung-up woman; this causes her blood to drip, which the second woman giddily rubs all over her nude body!!!! This sexual sadism's completed with the second woman eventually slicing the strung-up woman's throat!I DARE any apologist to explain the five-star merit of this scene.Another wholesome part of family entertainment's when a former victim gets a guard's gun from him after hitting him when he enters a room. She then takes scissors and cuts of his p*nis, tossing the member onto the ground for guard dogs to eat. The guard's crotch-area is soaked in blood.I DARE any apologist to defend the five-star merit of this scene also.Yet another part's when a victim of a torturer is seen with one leg missing while the remaining leg's been skinned, exposing the muscles. Not content with this sadism, Eli Roth has the torturer actually cut off a piece of the victim and then eating the piece at a table.I DARE any apologist to argue the five-star merit of said scene.Aside from the aforementioned, mere snippet of the indulgent vices of Hostel 2, there's also enormous profanity, drug use and lewdness thrown in just to make sure this film is as diametrically opposed to godliness as possible. I counted 81 F-words, four disrespectful slang-terms for women (c*nt), three S-words, and the equally sacrilegious breaking of the Third Commandment in Judeo-Christian tradition (I know the Hostel 2 apologists won't care since they're unholy varmint) with the misuse of ""Oh my God"" 11 times.In concluding my scalding reprimand to Hostel 2 fans, I'll say this movie has absolutely no redeemable merits and therefore should be chastised on account of its heinously harmful effect on society. This movie isn't a movie at all; it's nothing but a barely veiled attempt at melding sadomasochism together with torture to create a new form of virulent porn: the porn that gets people off through sexual sadism!!!! Eli Roth has brutal, psychological problems for crafting something this putridly destructive, as do ALL viewers who don't find this objectionable.",1,Want to become so morally twisted from a movie?!!!!!

1095153,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B000UJ48OU,The Piper at the Gates,"[0, 1]","To begin with, I had mixed feelings about the first Hostel film. That film had its moments, but overall, I wasn't so sure that it was all that great. So I really didn't know how well I would receive this sequel. And overall, I  have lukewarm feelings about this one as well. The movie picks up exactly where the last one left off, and the first minutes of the film are good, but after that, the basic story is really the same as the first movie, except this one involves 3 females, rather than males. Three American girls who are studying abroad, are persuaded by a newly acquainted girl to go on a spa vacation in Slovakia. And though there is a little more back story about this ""torture club"", and how it works and who runs it, there's still not many new twists from that of the first Hostel. Like I said, the first few minutes of the film, in which Jay Hernandez reprises his role as the only survivor of the first film, are quite good. But after that sequence ends, the film returns to a slow pace, and really nothing much happens until the last half of the movie. I think that this film lacks some of the suspense and mystery that the first Hostel had, simply because the viewer knows what's going on. In the first film, the audience wasn't sure what was happening, who the bad guys were, or why they were torturing innocent people. Now, with all these questions pretty much being answered, the viewer mostly knows what's gonna happen. Yes, there are a few little twists, one of which I don't fully buy in to. I won't spoil it for the ones that haven't seen the film, but there is an almost complete ""role reversal' between two characters, which I thought was way too quick, and it seems too contrived in an attempt to be clever. The ending of the film would have been good, if not for the very stupid ""soccer"" game that breaks out between the kids at the last minute! And speaking of kids, I have to tip my hat to this film for at least not holding back. Yes, there is a death of a child shown in this film, and I have to give credit to any film that has the balls to do something like that. As far as other death scenes and the blood/gore content, its pretty good. There's an excellent (if who can use this word to describe things like this!) and a quite realistic castration scene which I thought was pretty graphic. However, I feel there was less torture in this film than the first Hostel, and the killings came to quick most of the time. All in all, I think this film isn't as good as the first one. It pretty much uses the same blueprint as the first film, where it doesn't start getting really good until the last 30-40 minutes of the movie. Only this time, you already know what's going on. For this reason, I don't feel this sequel is as good as the first film. However, as a stand alone movie, its still pretty good. But I wouldn't buy it brand new unless its got a cheap price tag to go along with it.",3,"An OK Sequel, but its just more of the same....",1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,2919,"['begin', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'first', 'Hostel', 'film', 'film', 'had', 'moments', 'overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'sure', 'was', 'great', 'So', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'well', 'would', 'receive', 'sequel', 'overall', 'have', 'lukewarm', 'feelings', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'up', 'exactly', 'where', 'last', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'first', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'good', 'basic', 'story', 'really', 'same', 'first', 'movie', 'one', '3', 'females', 'rather', 'males', 'Three', 'American', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'studying', 'abroad', 'are', 'persuaded', 'newly', 'acquainted', 'girl', 'go', 'spa', 'vacation', 'Slovakia', 'little', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'torture', 'club', 'how', 'who', 'still', 'not', 'many', 'new', 'twists', 'first', 'Hostel', 'said', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'role', 'only', 'survivor', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'sequence', 'film', 'returns', 'slow', 'pace', 'really', 'nothing', 'much', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'think', 'film', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'first', 'Hostel', 'had', 'simply', 'viewer', 'what', 'going', 'first', 'film', 'audience', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'why', 'were', 'torturing', 'innocent', 'people', 'Now', 'questions', 'pretty', 'much', 'being', 'answered', 'viewer', 'mostly', 'what', 'gon', 'happen', 'Yes', 'are', 'few', 'little', 'twists', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'fully', 'buy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ones', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'almost', 'complete', 'role', 'reversal', 'two', 'characters', 'thought', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'quick', 'too', 'contrived', 'attempt', 'be', 'clever', 'ending', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'not', 'very', 'stupid', 'soccer', 'game', 'out', 'kids', 'last', 'minute', 'speaking', 'kids', 'have', 'tip', 'hat', 'film', 'least', 'not', 'holding', 'back', 'Yes', 'death', 'child', 'shown', 'film', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'film', 'balls', 'do', 'something', 'As', 'far', 'other', 'death', 'scenes', 'blood/gore', 'content', 'pretty', 'good', 'excellent', 'who', 'can', 'use', 'word', 'describe', 'things', 'quite', 'realistic', 'castration', 'scene', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'However', 'feel', 'there', 'was', 'less', 'torture', 'film', 'first', 'Hostel', 'killings', 'came', 'quick', 'most', 'time', 'think', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'blueprint', 'first', 'film', 'where', ""n't"", 'start', 'getting', 'really', 'good', 'last', '30-40', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Only', 'time', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sequel', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'film', 'However', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'brand', 'new', 'got', 'cheap', 'price', 'tag', 'go', 'along']",N/A
1095154,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000UJ48OU,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[3, 6]","When the originalHostelwas released, I was surprised at the manner in which Eli Roth (with a little help from his pal Quentin Tarantino) upended the horror template with a political allegory. In the original, all the victims were male, putzes, and essentially unlikable. You had to almost force yourself to root for Paxton even though you thought he was a first class A-hole. Add the relatively spooky plot and you had a better than average scare flick. Naturally, Hostel's success all but mandated a sequel.And just as naturally, Hostel II blows chunks of body parts. Having used up all the original ideas in version one, Roth resorts to cliches for version two. The all-female victims are a central-casting clutch of American Students studying art abroad. You have the uber-nerd, uber-beyocth and uber-rich all lured to the infamous factory, where one by one, they get chased, trapped and captured for their trips to the chamber of horrors. The attempt at altering the obvious is done by giving us a glimpse at the manner of attracting clients to the factory, which is given a semi-funny montage. You also get to meet the brains behind the ""Elite Hunting"" organization, which removes some of the suspense...he's just another wealthy European aristocrat.Eventually the three girls are brought in for their torture-kills. While ""Hostel 2"" does up the gore from volume one, the shock value is wasted. It's just mindless killing for the sake of titillation (although the too-short power cord was good for a nervous release chuckle), and Roth seemed more interested in seeing how many taboos he could cram into 90 minutes. Kill a kid? Check. Rape? Check. Cannibalism? Check. Gross-outs involving animals? Check check and triple check. It all adds up to a mind-numbing montage of excess without substance.About the only place where ""Hostel 2"" outdoes its predecessor is the final twist. When it's time for the obligatory final victim to escape, the manner in which she does so did manage to throw me. It was the only thing about this movie that was unexpected, saving it from a single star rating.

For the sequel Roth changes the gender of the students to female (Lauren German, Heather Matarazzo and Bijou Phillips) and also includes the sub-plots of ""buyers"" or sadistic tormentors played by Roger Bart and Richard Burgi.Not much can be said about the thin plot originally inspired by urban legends. ""Hostel Part 2"" like its predecessor takes it granted that legends are true. As a consequence all we have to do is to wait for the tortures to begin, and end. The sequel provides the gruesome tortures and slow deaths and is full of blood and screams. The extremely graphic film, however, is hardly called scary because it has no nuance or subtlety suggesting the horrors that are to arrive.In fact the film does not attempt to hide the fact that terrible fates await the characters. There is no sense of suspense; what we don't know is the way how these unsuspecting students are tortured. But maybe two ""Hostel"" films are supposed to be like that. Roth is quite good at making the bloody torture scenes and the dark interior sets are impressive. The photography showing the countryside is also very good, beautiful and creepy at the same time.There is another thing Eli Roth is good at and that is the casting. The main cast is very good (and they are all talented), but here I'm talking about the cameos. Ruggero Deodato, director of ""Cannibal Holocaust"" briefly appears, doing something I shouldn't mention. Milan Knazko (who was really Minister for Culture of the Slovak Republic) appears as ""Sacha."" To watch cameos and references to other films would be pretty amusing to me because they are virtually the list of the people Roth idolizes. Was there Quentin Tarantino? Yes, watch the TV closely.However, I couldn't like the film very much despite (or because of) these ""merits."" From at certain point ""Hostel Part 2"" starts being too self-conscious. Should we take seriously the middle-aged lady taking a shower of blood, apparent reference to Elizabeth B&aacute;thory? Should we laugh when Roger Bart's character refers to one Disney animation character he played? The third act of the film almost becomes slapstick with gores.""Hostel Part 2"" with the structure that has been getting more and more repetitious since the original has surprisingly less scares than you expect, being emotionally detached from the viewers, almost cynical in its tone in describing the characters (good or bad, killing or killed) and their behaviors. The film is content with doing what it does, often disregarding the audiences who want to be scared or (if I may use the word) entertained.",3,Not as Terrible as People Say But Fails to Live Up to its Potential,1200787200,"01 20, 2008",2008,2795,"['Hostel', 'Part', '2', 'up', 'thread', 'where', 'original', 'left', 'off', 'effective', 'opening', 'chapter', 'director', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'telling', 'horrifying', 'tales', 'again', 'about', 'three', 'American', 'college', 'students', 'Slovakia', 'sequel', 'Roth', 'gender', 'students', 'female', 'Lauren', 'German', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'also', 'sub-plots', 'buyers', 'sadistic', 'tormentors', 'played', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'Richard', 'Burgi.Not', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'thin', 'plot', 'originally', 'inspired', 'urban', 'legends', 'Hostel', 'Part', '2', 'predecessor', 'granted', 'legends', 'are', 'true', 'consequence', 'have', 'do', 'wait', 'tortures', 'begin', 'end', 'sequel', 'gruesome', 'tortures', 'slow', 'deaths', 'full', 'blood', 'screams', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'film', 'however', 'hardly', 'called', 'scary', 'nuance', 'subtlety', 'suggesting', 'horrors', 'are', 'arrive.In', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'attempt', 'hide', 'fact', 'terrible', 'fates', 'await', 'characters', 'sense', 'suspense', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'how', 'unsuspecting', 'students', 'are', 'tortured', 'maybe', 'two', 'Hostel', 'films', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'Roth', 'quite', 'good', 'making', 'bloody', 'torture', 'scenes', 'dark', 'interior', 'sets', 'are', 'impressive', 'photography', 'showing', 'countryside', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'beautiful', 'creepy', 'same', 'thing', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'good', 'casting', 'main', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'talented', 'here', ""'m"", 'talking', 'cameos', 'Ruggero', 'Deodato', 'director', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', 'briefly', 'doing', 'something', 'should', ""n't"", 'mention', 'Milan', 'Knazko', 'who', 'was', 'really', 'Minister', 'Culture', 'Slovak', 'Republic', 'Sacha', 'watch', 'cameos', 'references', 'other', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'are', 'virtually', 'list', 'people', 'Roth', 'idolizes', 'Was', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Yes', 'watch', 'TV', 'closely.However', 'could', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'merits', 'certain', 'point', 'Hostel', 'Part', '2', 'starts', 'being', 'too', 'self-conscious', 'Should', 'take', 'seriously', 'middle-aged', 'lady', 'taking', 'shower', 'blood', 'apparent', 'reference', 'Elizabeth', 'B', 'aacute', 'thory', 'Should', 'laugh', 'when', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'character', 'refers', 'one', 'Disney', 'animation', 'character', 'played', 'third', 'act', 'film', 'almost', 'slapstick', 'gores', 'Hostel', 'Part', '2', 'structure', 'been', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'repetitious', 'original', 'surprisingly', 'less', 'scares', 'expect', 'being', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'viewers', 'almost', 'cynical', 'tone', 'describing', 'characters', 'good', 'bad', 'killing', 'killed', 'behaviors', 'film', 'content', 'doing', 'what', 'often', 'disregarding', 'audiences', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'scared', 'may', 'use', 'word', 'entertained']",N/A

Hostel 2 is the exact same premise as the first, but this time it gives you alot more than what you expect. This time you are taken behind the scenes of the opperation its self. You get to see who is involved in the 'hunting' process and who is sick enough to pay top dollar to fulfill their most gruesome of fantasies. Once again Eli Roth pushes the bar with the torturing of 3 young women who get lured into this sick world. Again in a short amount of time he really develops the characters so you actually connect with them. This time you see both sides of the coin, through the eyes of a trouble torturer who is wondering if it's something he really wants to do. There are so many things that you will see that either make you cover your eyes or even stand up and cheer.

It seems the defining alpha-omega load was blown in the 70s and 80s then refined in Japan for almost 2 decades as many reviewers have already noted. There isn't much you can do that hasn't been done besides soften up the delivery to ensure mass distribution. I really enjoyed the first Hostel film for its story, it seemed with a bit more restraint without taking the easy way out going with over the top comedy/violence it would have made for some classic material. Sometimes you need to be dark and uncompromising. For all of their flaws and unintentional humor, Cannibal Holocaust and Men Behind The Sun were unrelenting, gory, and made you feel truly awful after seeing them. More recently, Irreversible though only containing two extremely explicit (and genuinely disturbing) scenes of violence is far more my idea of what a hellish dark trip to Europe can be. No ""cute"" laughs in that one, if you were disappointed in this film but liked the scenery and dark mood it was trying to evoke check that movie out. If the violence doesn't give you a headache the camera work will.This movie is an unfortunate bore from start to finish, everything that has been done already in the first Hostel is done again, in the most uninspired way imaginable. It would have been good to see a straight film about two American businessmen who take a trip to a ""murder brothel"" and what happens. But here its just, urgghghg!  Also Eli Roth really needs to stop lifting scenes from other movies, the execution of the street kid was taken straight from City of God only this time its far more watered down, unshocking and lame. There's not even a blood spurt, whats the point? The only reason this movie exists is because violence is now completely acceptable in mainstream film, there is a massive audience ignorant of the genre this spawned from with an interest in the darker side of cinema so why not capitalize on it? I'm not saying its an outrage just, well, there's far better films out there heavy on violence that can be taken seriously enough to have an impression on you other than a re-run through the basics of Tom Savini splatterdom.As just a movie to watch, its boring, badly written, and horribly acted, the girl from Welcome To The Dollhouse, an amazing actress judging from that film, is reduced to a stuttering idiot who gets killed in a tribute to Elizabeth Bathory, you can actualy visualize Eli Roth's moronic thought process every step of the way down to how he cast the film. Eli Roth probably won't reach the heights of badness Wes Craven did in the 90s ruining the horror genre for a decade+ but he's certainly the kid with the Green Day shirt at the GG Allin show.

It's a sign of the times, considering how jaded everyone is with all the onslaught of killings and violence in so many movies.  The ""Saw"" movies seem to be quite popular, they take violence to the extreme, over-do it like they weren't hugged enough by their mothers, and rely on a so-so storyline that's rehash, yet people love it, to each his own.  ""Hostel 2"" manages to continue the story without being predictable and unleashing more insight about the heart of the story, the murder club and the people involved.  Part 2 is filmed more artsy, the killings more poetic and not as torturous as the shocking first one.  By this time I was more acclamated to the deceiving first steps in capturing the victims, so I wasn't as shocked as I was when viewing the first Hostel.  One thing Eli Roth does extremley well is flip the script because it's hard to surprise me.  Like I was surprised that he killed off the nice n' nerdy girl first, I thought she was going to be the one running all alone in the woods at the end.  Humanity doesn't mean a thing in the Hostel movies, there is no compassion and no heart at all, and that is what makes these films as sick and disturbing as they are.  I do agree however that Mr. Roth would have pushed the gore to the next level, bump it up a notch or two maybe next time around.  I hope they continue the Hostel story for at least 2-3 more, and it has to be under the realm and threshhold of Quintin Tarantino, it can be done no other way.  I hope they can continue with a fresh take and keep it original.  Eli Roth is a master at character development and chooses the right actors with the right energy, so good job for him.
