1513564,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B0068MNO20,Addicted2Amazon!,"[7, 7]","About myself:  I am a high intermediate DVD workout junkie.  :-)  I do anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half of both cardio and strength 3 times per week. If I'm not burning and covered in sweat, then it's not a good workout and I'm wasting my time!  :-)Now that being said, none of these three 20 minute dance workouts would be enough on its own for myself or anyone who works out like I do.As I've said, this DVD is composed of three 20-minute dance workouts, each one reflecting a different dance style:  Club Dance, Caribbean and Latin.  Warming up and cooling down are included in the 20-minute workouts.Club Dance is the most aerobically challenging, in my opinion.  It is the fastest-paced and highest impact of them all, with lots of hopping and deep bending, so your legs will burn and your heart rate will climb faster.Caribbean Dance is a little slower, a little lower impact.  It has a lot of twisting, Afro-Latin/Caribbean moves. Though the moves are lower impact, they're fast-paced enough for a good sweat to kick in about halfway through the workout.  By the end of the workout, I'm pretty sweaty.The slowest and least aerobically challenging is the Latin Dance.  There is absolutely no impact, and you go through traditional mambos, cross steps, back steps, waist twists, etc.  Though I find this fun, it takes me a while to get a good sweat going during this one, even throwing myself into the moves with energy and some exageration.  It seems as though I am just starting to get good and sweaty when it's time for the cool down.I think these workouts are fun and effective, but unless you're an absolute beginner, you'll want more.  If this is the case, you can do one of two things:1. Do all three workouts together for an hour of dance cardio, or 2. Do what I do and use just one 20-minute workout as a cardio add-on to other workouts. I like to do one of these workouts and then follow it with strength training.  THEN I feel like I've had a great workout!  :-)Love The Firm!  Love dance!  I would definitely recommend this workout!",4,Fun and Varied Dance Workouts; Great as a Cardio Add-On,1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,2060,"['am', 'high', 'intermediate', 'DVD', 'workout', 'junkie', 'do', 'anywhere', 'hour', 'hour', 'half', 'cardio', 'strength', '3', 'times', 'week', ""'m"", 'not', 'burning', 'covered', 'sweat', 'then', 'not', 'good', 'workout', ""'m"", 'wasting', 'time', 'Now', 'being', 'said', 'none', 'three', '20', 'minute', 'dance', 'workouts', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'own', 'anyone', 'who', 'do.As', ""'ve"", 'said', 'DVD', 'composed', 'three', '20-minute', 'dance', 'workouts', 'one', 'reflecting', 'different', 'dance', 'style', 'Club', 'Dance', 'Caribbean', 'Latin', 'Warming', 'up', 'cooling', 'down', 'are', 'included', '20-minute', 'workouts.Club', 'Dance', 'most', 'aerobically', 'challenging', 'opinion', 'fastest-paced', 'highest', 'impact', 'lots', 'hopping', 'deep', 'bending', 'legs', 'will', 'burn', 'heart', 'rate', 'will', 'climb', 'faster.Caribbean', 'Dance', 'little', 'slower', 'little', 'lower', 'impact', 'lot', 'twisting', 'Afro-Latin/Caribbean', 'moves', 'moves', 'are', 'lower', 'impact', ""'re"", 'fast-paced', 'enough', 'good', 'sweat', 'kick', 'about', 'halfway', 'workout', 'end', 'workout', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sweaty.The', 'slowest', 'least', 'aerobically', 'challenging', 'Latin', 'Dance', 'absolutely', 'impact', 'go', 'traditional', 'mambos', 'cross', 'steps', 'back', 'steps', 'waist', 'twists', 'etc', 'find', 'fun', 'while', 'get', 'good', 'sweat', 'going', 'one', 'even', 'throwing', 'moves', 'energy', 'exageration', 'am', 'just', 'starting', 'get', 'good', 'sweaty', 'when', 'time', 'cool', 'down.I', 'think', 'workouts', 'are', 'fun', 'effective', ""'re"", 'absolute', 'beginner', ""'ll"", 'want', 'more', 'case', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'two', 'things:1', 'Do', 'three', 'workouts', 'together', 'hour', 'dance', 'cardio', '2', 'Do', 'what', 'do', 'use', 'just', 'one', '20-minute', 'workout', 'cardio', 'add-on', 'other', 'workouts', 'like', 'do', 'one', 'workouts', 'then', 'follow', 'strength', 'training', 'THEN', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'had', 'great', 'workout', 'Love', 'Firm', 'Love', 'dance', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'workout']",Firm: Cardio Dance Club
1513565,A39ZZZ1Q62IY23,B0068MNO20,Ashley,"[0, 0]",I see mixed reviews on this video but I didn't think it was too bad. The positive things about this video is it's very crisp and clear (doesn't look like it was made in the 90s but looks like its HD). It's just an empty dance room with 3 instructors (but only one talks through out the video) so it kind of makes me feel like I'm at an exercise class in the gym :). I thought the moves kind of reminded me of Zumba :) or Shabam. I haven't completed the full video but I think it's a pretty nice.,4,Fun,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,495,"['see', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'video', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'too', 'bad', 'positive', 'things', 'video', 'very', 'crisp', 'clear', ""n't"", 'look', 'was', 'made', '90s', 'HD', 'just', 'empty', 'dance', 'room', '3', 'instructors', 'only', 'one', 'talks', 'video', 'kind', 'feel', ""'m"", 'exercise', 'class', 'gym', 'thought', 'moves', 'kind', 'reminded', 'Zumba', 'Shabam', 'have', ""n't"", 'completed', 'full', 'video', 'think', 'pretty', 'nice']",Firm: Cardio Dance Club

Lane ""sweetness""","[0, 0]","i didnt enjoy this dvd as much as i did the best of the firm club dance. the club dance is a longer workout and at a faster pace. this dvd has one fast paced workout and 2 slow routines eanch for 20 min each. the routines are fun to learn, but i thought i would do more of a stronger workout. what i really dont like about this dvd is the fact that it is a 20 min workout, so you have to learn how to do the routines as they are doing it; like youre just supposed to know all the steps. once you practice a few times, you should have it down pat, but i dont like that they dont give you the time to learn",3,cardio dance firm,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,604,"['i', 'didnt', 'enjoy', 'dvd', 'as', 'much', 'i', 'did', 'best', 'firm', 'club', 'dance', 'club', 'dance', 'longer', 'workout', 'faster', 'pace', 'dvd', 'one', 'fast', 'paced', 'workout', '2', 'slow', 'routines', 'eanch', '20', 'min', 'routines', 'are', 'fun', 'learn', 'i', 'thought', 'i', 'would', 'do', 'more', 'stronger', 'workout', 'what', 'really', 'dont', 'dvd', 'fact', '20', 'min', 'workout', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'do', 'routines', 'are', 'doing', 'youre', 'just', 'supposed', 'know', 'steps', 'once', 'practice', 'few', 'times', 'should', 'have', 'down', 'pat', 'i', 'dont', 'dont', 'give', 'time', 'learn']",Firm: Cardio Dance Club
