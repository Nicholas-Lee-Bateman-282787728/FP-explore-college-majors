Helena Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes are well cast as Lady Jane and Guilford Dudley.  There is able support from Patrick Stewart and John Abbott.  However, this movie is more idealized than accurate.Lady Jane is little more than an avatar for 1960s idealism in this film.  Having public schools, 20th Century style welfare programs were probably not on her agenda.  This is what detracted from the film.The actor playing John Dudley was a good portrayal.  He really didn't care about the Protestant vs. Catholic conflict.  He wanted to maintain the Dudley family fortunes.The movie was disappointing in that the real Lady Jane Grey would have been a great movie.

(I ultimately studied Renaissance lit in college, and maybe this movie had a little bit to do with that!)At my young age, I was of course drawn to the romantic part of the story--I was hopelessly enchanted with Cary Elwes, and I'm sure the blossoming romance between Guildford and Jane caused me a great many sighs. Okay, so it is a little fairy-taleish and not exactly true to history (I once read that it is uncertain whether or not their marriage was ever consummated) but it was awfully fun to watch.Now that I'm older, however, I've noticed some other things that interest me more than the love story, like the political machinations of Northumberland and Jane's parents, and the stark portrayal of the treatment of women in that time period. Jane was vitally important to the plans of her parents, and yet they beat her nearly senseless for refusing to marry Guildford Dudley.Helena Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes are very believable in their roles--Jane seems otherworldly and disconnected from her feelings due to her obsession with learning; Guildford is a handsome rake who does actually have deep thoughts and ideas about things, contrary to what Jane thinks at first.

213551,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6300214559,Deborah Earle,"[28, 28]","This gem of a film is from Helena Bonham-Carter's ingenue days in which she captures the strength of the pious and studious Nine-Days Queen magnificently. Strangely, paintings show she bears a stronger resemblance to Guildford Dudley than Cary Elwes, who makes up for his lack of physical resemblance to Jane's slovenly, disreputable husband by turning out a charismatic and thoughtful performance.This rather heavy-handed account of Jane Grey's life has a lot of symbolism. In a very English hunting scene at the beginning (which closely resembles a Breughel painting), we see the elders in Jane's life closing in on a deer in much the same way they would trap Jane into serving their own corrupt ends. After Jane is whipped by her mother for her reluctance to marry the obnoxious Guildford Dudley, King Edward comforts her by giving her a puppet to play with. The symbolism of that moment at this point in the film is blantantly obvious.Michael Hordern's Father Fekenham is a comforting presence in Jane's life, despite their disagreements over religion. He never hides the amount of respect he has for the young girl.Inaccuracies of the film include the fact that Jane's parents, played by a hard-driven Patrick Stewart, and a ruthless Sarah Kestelman(who reaffirms the fact that the saintliness of Frances Grey's mother, Mary, who was Henry VIII's younger sister, truly skipped a generation)responded to Jane's initial refusal to marry Guildford by respectively slapping her in the face repeatedly and cursing her. While one is greatful that the audience is spared that, the nude scene between Jane and Guildford was a bit gratuitous, and as Jane was actually unwavering in her resentment of her chosen husband, it's highly unlikely that their union was consumated. But the earlier wedding scene was indeed, a phantasmagoria of white and gold, and beautiful to watch.After her scheming elders place her on the throne, there is no evidence that Jane became, as Americans might say, a forerunner to FDR. She took to her bed, grief-stricken over the loss of King Edward.There is some truth to Guildford's having provided some comfort to her at this time, and part of the dialogue that is heard in the initial coronation scene is based on historical fact.As Jane's Governess, Mrs. Ellen,played by Jill Bennett, stands by, a helpless witness to her brilliant charge's fate, Jane Lapotaire's gracefully portrayed Mary reclaims her throne, Henry Grey tears down the royal canopy, and all the conspirators, reluctant or otherwise, are placed under arrest. Jane bears these indignities, as she has many others throughout her life, with a courage and patience well beyond her years. John Dudley becomes a turncoat, deciding to return to Catholicism to save himself, much to the dismay of Guildford. But this scheme doesn't work. Jane and Guildford almost escape with their lives, until Henry Grey joins a rebellion to restore Jane to the throne.Certain scenes of Jane's final days in the tower were given better treatment in the 1936 film, "" Nine Days A Queen"", starring Nova Pilbeam, and John Mills. But in the scenes of Jane on the scaffold are, for the most part, well-reenacted in this film. The sense of sorrow witnesses have at the brutal death that is to be faced by a girl so young, so brilliant, so sweet, and so innocent is almost beyond expession. Even Queen Mary (I hesitate to call her ""Bloody Mary"" when her father killed more people and has more flattering nicknames ascribed to him only because he had better P.R.)must have sensed that hers would not be a blessed reign as a result of her having to execute her own cousin in order to marry a Spanish King and restore England to Catholicism.Frances Brandon Grey is shown curtseying to the Queen who has just executed her daughter and who would soon execute her husband. Ironically, she would become a court favorite with the Queen. But there is some sense of justice in the fact that history has not been kind to Jane Grey's parents.Trevor Nunn has given the world a sharp, glistening, stately, and lavish production filled with a great sense of period and place. Whatever inconsistancies this film may have with history,its loving homage to Jane Grey is well-paid.",4,"Noble, Regal, Sparkling, Solemn, Tragic",1021161600,"05 12, 2002",2002,4224,"['gem', 'film', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'ingenue', 'days', 'strength', 'pious', 'studious', 'Nine-Days', 'Queen', 'magnificently', 'Strangely', 'paintings', 'show', 'stronger', 'resemblance', 'Guildford', 'Dudley', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'who', 'up', 'lack', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'Jane', 'slovenly', 'disreputable', 'husband', 'turning', 'out', 'charismatic', 'thoughtful', 'performance.This', 'rather', 'heavy-handed', 'account', 'Jane', 'Grey', 'life', 'lot', 'symbolism', 'very', 'English', 'hunting', 'scene', 'beginning', 'closely', 'Breughel', 'painting', 'see', 'elders', 'Jane', 'life', 'closing', 'deer', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'would', 'trap', 'Jane', 'serving', 'own', 'corrupt', 'ends', 'Jane', 'whipped', 'mother', 'reluctance', 'marry', 'obnoxious', 'Guildford', 'Dudley', 'King', 'Edward', 'giving', 'puppet', 'play', 'symbolism', 'moment', 'point', 'film', 'blantantly', 'obvious.Michael', 'Hordern', 'Father', 'Fekenham', 'comforting', 'presence', 'Jane', 'life', 'disagreements', 'religion', 'never', 'amount', 'respect', 'young', 'girl.Inaccuracies', 'film', 'include', 'fact', 'Jane', 'parents', 'played', 'hard-driven', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'ruthless', 'Sarah', 'Kestelman', 'who', 'fact', 'saintliness', 'Frances', 'Grey', 'mother', 'Mary', 'who', 'was', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'younger', 'sister', 'truly', 'skipped', 'generation', 'responded', 'Jane', 'initial', 'refusal', 'marry', 'Guildford', 'respectively', 'slapping', 'face', 'repeatedly', 'cursing', 'one', 'greatful', 'audience', 'spared', 'nude', 'scene', 'Jane', 'Guildford', 'was', 'bit', 'gratuitous', 'Jane', 'was', 'actually', 'unwavering', 'resentment', 'chosen', 'husband', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'union', 'was', 'consumated', 'earlier', 'wedding', 'scene', 'was', 'indeed', 'phantasmagoria', 'white', 'gold', 'beautiful', 'watch.After', 'scheming', 'elders', 'place', 'throne', 'evidence', 'Jane', 'became', 'Americans', 'might', 'say', 'forerunner', 'FDR', 'took', 'bed', 'grief-stricken', 'loss', 'King', 'Edward.There', 'truth', 'Guildford', 'having', 'provided', 'comfort', 'time', 'part', 'dialogue', 'heard', 'initial', 'coronation', 'scene', 'based', 'historical', 'fact.As', 'Jane', 'Governess', 'Mrs.', 'Ellen', 'played', 'Jill', 'Bennett', 'helpless', 'witness', 'brilliant', 'charge', 'fate', 'Jane', 'Lapotaire', 'gracefully', 'portrayed', 'Mary', 'throne', 'Henry', 'Grey', 'down', 'royal', 'canopy', 'conspirators', 'reluctant', 'otherwise', 'are', 'placed', 'arrest', 'Jane', 'indignities', 'many', 'others', 'life', 'courage', 'patience', 'well', 'years', 'John', 'Dudley', 'turncoat', 'deciding', 'return', 'Catholicism', 'save', 'much', 'dismay', 'Guildford', 'scheme', ""n't"", 'work', 'Jane', 'Guildford', 'almost', 'escape', 'lives', 'Henry', 'Grey', 'rebellion', 'restore', 'Jane', 'throne.Certain', 'scenes', 'Jane', 'final', 'days', 'tower', 'were', 'given', 'better', 'treatment', '1936', 'film', 'Nine', 'Queen', 'starring', 'Nova', 'Pilbeam', 'John', 'Mills', 'scenes', 'Jane', 'scaffold', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'well-reenacted', 'film', 'sense', 'sorrow', 'witnesses', 'have', 'brutal', 'death', 'be', 'faced', 'girl', 'so', 'young', 'so', 'brilliant', 'so', 'sweet', 'so', 'innocent', 'almost', 'expession', 'Even', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'hesitate', 'call', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'when', 'father', 'killed', 'more', 'people', 'more', 'flattering', 'nicknames', 'ascribed', 'only', 'had', 'better', 'P.R', 'must', 'have', 'sensed', 'hers', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'blessed', 'reign', 'result', 'having', 'execute', 'own', 'cousin', 'order', 'marry', 'Spanish', 'King', 'restore', 'England', 'Catholicism.Frances', 'Brandon', 'Grey', 'shown', 'curtseying', 'Queen', 'who', 'just', 'executed', 'daughter', 'who', 'would', 'soon', 'execute', 'husband', 'Ironically', 'would', 'become', 'court', 'favorite', 'Queen', 'sense', 'justice', 'fact', 'history', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'Jane', 'Grey', 'parents.Trevor', 'Nunn', 'given', 'world', 'sharp', 'glistening', 'stately', 'lavish', 'production', 'filled', 'great', 'sense', 'period', 'place', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'history', 'loving', 'homage', 'Jane', 'Grey', 'well-paid']",Lady Jane VHS

Unfortunately, the writers of this film's script adapted a few facts and sandwiched stock, pat fiction in between.Helena Bonham Carter, at once beautiful and earnest, does give the viewer a flavour of the intellectual, devout, and manipulated Jane, and the acting, scenery, and music are first rate and the reason for my high rating. There is a sense of Edward VI's concern for the sucession, how Jane was used as a pawn, and such historical truths as, for example, how the poor were reduced to destitution when there no longer was monastery land to farm.Beyond that, the circumstances of Jane's life and brief reign are so distorted as to make the book verge on the farcical. Whatever factors there were in Jane's situation, no part of it was in any way a &quot;love story.&quot; The depiction of the madly romancing couple managing all sorts of reforms (for example, &quot;their shilling&quot;) within a matter of a week practically reduces Jane's story to camp. One could get the absurd impression that Jane's being manipulated, even beaten, into a marriage with Dudley was a piece of good fortune with a happy, if brief, outcome.Of course, those who believe that history in no way matters are welcome to compose fictional love stories... but, when anyone had as intriguing a true story as did Jane, it is preferable for such love stories to not borrow her name.",4,Visually delightful - story poor,997833600,"08 15, 2001",2001,1458,"['story', 'real', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'tragic', 'fascinating', 'would', 'make', 'wonderful', 'screen', 'play', 'Unfortunately', 'writers', 'film', 'script', 'adapted', 'few', 'facts', 'sandwiched', 'stock', 'pat', 'fiction', 'between.Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'once', 'beautiful', 'earnest', 'give', 'viewer', 'flavour', 'intellectual', 'devout', 'manipulated', 'Jane', 'acting', 'scenery', 'music', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'reason', 'high', 'rating', 'sense', 'Edward', 'VI', 'concern', 'sucession', 'how', 'Jane', 'was', 'used', 'pawn', 'such', 'historical', 'truths', 'example', 'how', 'poor', 'were', 'reduced', 'destitution', 'when', 'no', 'longer', 'was', 'monastery', 'land', 'farm.Beyond', 'circumstances', 'Jane', 'life', 'brief', 'reign', 'are', 'so', 'distorted', 'make', 'book', 'verge', 'farcical', 'factors', 'were', 'Jane', 'situation', 'part', 'was', 'way', 'quot', 'story.', 'quot', 'depiction', 'madly', 'romancing', 'couple', 'managing', 'sorts', 'reforms', 'example', 'quot', 'shilling', 'quot', 'matter', 'week', 'practically', 'Jane', 'story', 'camp', 'One', 'could', 'get', 'absurd', 'impression', 'Jane', 'being', 'manipulated', 'even', 'beaten', 'marriage', 'Dudley', 'was', 'piece', 'good', 'fortune', 'happy', 'brief', 'outcome.Of', 'course', 'who', 'believe', 'history', 'way', 'matters', 'are', 'welcome', 'compose', 'fictional', 'love', 'stories', 'when', 'anyone', 'had', 'intriguing', 'true', 'story', 'did', 'Jane', 'preferable', 'such', 'love', 'stories', 'not', 'borrow', 'name']",Lady Jane VHS
213555,A2VE83MZF98ITY,6300214559,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[5, 6]","First a bit of history:The world of the Tudors and their friends, hangers-on and rivals from the time of Lancaster/York conflict, reads like a soap opera, and indeed it was a time of intrigue, deception, jockeying for position and occasional outright evil behaviour. The executioner's task at the Tower was never wanting for more; the Tudors, Seymours, Brandons, Dudleys and other such families were intertwined in the political, religious and dynastic machinations of the time, and sometimes this late medieval machinery caught up the people as it would grind along.Lady Jane Grey was not born to be queen. This does not make her unique among monarchs in British history; when the current queen Elizabeth was born, it seemed very remote that she should ever advance to be monarch. Indeed, even the great Henry VIII wasn't the heir apparent when born; his brother Arthur was Prince of Wales -- Henry married his brother's widow Catherine of Aragon, and the successive sequence of wives and offspring commenced from there. Lady Jane Grey was born of none of these wives, nor even from Henry directly, but rather through one of his younger siblings, Mary, one-time queen of France.Lady Jane Grey was a mere teenager when she came to power, such as it was. A precocious and intellectual child, she still lacked the political savvy of the Privy Council and other chief executors and leaders from Henry and Edward's reigns; she was the not-always-willing but not-unwilling pawn of her family's ambitions -- at one time thought to be a possible wife for the king Edward, her family jumped at the chance of settling the crown directly on her head, under the ostensible purpose of preserving a Protestant succession.Ultimately, the venture was doomed to failure, for as much as the royal and parliamentary authorities like to believe they rule England, ultimately it has been the people en masse, and those whom they do not support do not last long. The common folk, still largely Catholic in leaning, also understood royal succession in simple terms -- Mary Tudor was the next in line for the throne, so they supported her (largely they would support Elizabeth, a moderate Protestant, for the same reason five years later). Lady Jane fell victim again to the problems of politics; Mary Tudor, once queen, was inclined to be lenient until it was felt that Jane's presence continued to be a rallying point for Protestant dissidents.Jane Grey was queen for nine short days, during a period of great turmoil.Here endeth the lesson.  And much of the similarity with the film.This film is historical romance, which makes it necessary to fudge the facts a bit.  We are introduced to the scheming people around the ailing teen-aged king Edward; John Dudley (played admirably by John Wood) as Duke of Northumberland tries to ensure the Protestant succession through ruling out Mary, but also tries to secure his own hegemony by ruling out the independent Elizabeth.  Lady Jane could be controlled, or so promised her mother, Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk (played by Sara Kestelman).  Patrick Stewart plays Lady Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, but his role here is rather understated.Truly the best performance in the film is that of Helena Bonham-Carter, in one of her early roles (fresh from the Merchant-Ivory production, 'A Room with a View').  She plays the intelligent but not always swift-on-the-uptake Lady Jane, competent in academic subjects, scrupulously moral, and history's plaything.  Whether all of these descriptors were true of the actual Lady Jane, we cannot know.  What we do know is that Lady Jane in fact despised her arranged husband Guildford Dudley, younger son of the manipulative Duke of Northumberland.  However, for purposes of the film, this is a romance, rocky at the start, but nonetheless a love affair that blossoms quickly - well, it would have to, given the time frame.  Cary Elwes, in his first major role, performs well as the companion to the unlikely and unwilling queen.Elwes and Bonham-Carter have good chemistry together on the screen for the most part.  Bonham-Carter's other primary relationship is brief but substantial in the form of an intellectual attachment to the kindly Dr. Feckenham, a Catholic clergyman who is willing to engage in the theological discussion with a Protestant; Michael Horden gives a memorable performance as the intercessor between the Greys and Mary Tudor.The cinematography is very good, stunning in a few points.  Costumes and sets are well done, and music overlay is worthwhile.The story progresses through an abbreviated presentation of King Edward's illness, leading to the necessity  for succession.  The various intrigues and issues are collapsed into a few, primarily dominated by Northumberland; the ambassador of Spain and his dealings with Queen Mary also factor into the plot.  The impoverishment of the people, and the lack of popularity the ruling class had at the time is shown; the Protestant Reformations in England were not popular movements at the start.As history dictates, both the younger Dudley and Lady Jane, nine-day queen, lose their heads over the affair.  We are given a glimpse of the historical reality that Lady Jane's mother was in fact 'rehabilitated' into the court of Queen Mary, but her husband Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, is killed for his involvement in an uprising against Queen Mary.Setting aside the historical inaccuracies, this is a good film, well produced and well acted, and does serve to highlight some of the major historical themes of the time.  Perhaps it will inspire the viewer to read more and learn the actual events of the time, one of the more colourful in royal history.",5,Queen for a day,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,5690,"['First',

This was the movie that launched the career of the brilliant and versatile Helena Bonham Carter.

The scene where she beats Jane in to submission with whip, while Jane is restricted in stocks is just heartbreaking.But some of the liberties taken with history from Jane's marriage to Guildford Dudley (Cary Elwes) went just too far for artistic license.

213558,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,6300214559,Get What We Give,"[9, 11]","Lady Jane Grey, niece to Henry VIII, was appointed to the throne due to the corrupt machinations of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. Her cousin, King Edward VI of England was a mere boy of 15 when he deeded the throne to her by deeming his sisters bastards (and thus severing the throne from the Catholic side of the family and ensuring that Henry's reformation would continue). Mary, Edward's sister, wouldn't sit still for this and she sought to overtake the throne upon Edward's death. Northumberland led the troops in an ill fated attempt to repel Mary. She regained the throne after only 9 days of rule by her cousin Jane Grey and her young husband, Guilford Dudley (an arranged marriage at the bequest of Northumberland and Jane's parents). Jane Grey and Guilford were subsequently executed for treason and heresy.All of these points come out in the film ""Lady Jane"". However, the film is geared to being a romance and as such, the historical facts get a bit muddied along the way.The acting is quite fine - indeed. Helena Bonham Carter, as Jane Grey, kicked off her ""costume drama"" career with this film. Cary Elwes, with only a couple of films under his belt (Another Country), as Guilford, strikes a handsome, roguish pose and delivers a finely controlled and believable performance. The rest of the cast is made up of fine British actors who are more than capable of carrying their own weight.

But Mary will not be denied her throne (and neither will her husband, the Spanish king).  Queen Jane is removed and condemned to death, quite a common fate back then.

The sets, costumes, and other period details are terrific as well.  I wasn't expecting to see a romance film, which is what this movie develops into.  It's not very accurate, although the actors have a great chemistry and make it work.  I was expecting to see more of the political behind-the-scenes treachery, since the story of Lady Jane is rooted in religious conflict and personal ambition.

""Bloody Mary"" ascends the thrown and before Protestant Elizabeth becomes Queen of England.The story of Lady Jane Grey is truly the saddest IMO of them all.Intelligent,well read and fifteen,Jane (Helena Bonham Carter) becomes the unwilling pawn of her parents and others to keep a Protestant on the throne.She is forced to marry Guilford Dudley (Cary Elwes),another reluctant young pawn in order to secure the English Throne.Jane Grey's parents were known to be awful towards her, and Sara Kestleman as Frances Grey is as cruel and sadistic as a mother could be.The screenplay is quite direct and accessible and the characters are well delineatedin order to keep a very central story moving along.Historically, the only real liberties are in the creation and assumption of what transpires in the lives of these two in the very brief nine days where they are on top of the world,as it were.If the love story is fabricated....who cares...it's a good one done by two wonderful young actors of their generation!!!For nine brief days, Jane ruled England.Did she ever really want to? Historians and the director,Trevor Nunn resounding say NO;but like most players in that time,many lost their heads either willingly or unwillingly either in pursuing or fleeing the crown!The rest of this film is downright accurate and quite compelling.Of all the ""English monarch films"" I put LADY JANE at the ""head"" (or should I say ""headless""!) top of the list.Anyone who follows the topic of the Catholic-Protestant ""throne trade-off years"" will love this one.This is a film to watch many times for its fine acting,cinematography,and  educational value.Chances are.....you will cry because history is quite unfair to innocent people!",5,"Superior film,magnificent screenplay,historical license make LADY JANE a must see!",1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,2283,"['SIX', 'WIVES', 'OF', 'HENRY', 'V111', 'ELIZABETH', 'upcoming', 'ELIZABETH', 'GOLDEN', 'AGE', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'PLEASE', 'stop', 'take', 'earth-shattering', 'look', 'LADY', 'JANE', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Cary', 'Elwes.This', 'one', 'sumptuous', 'film', 'acting', 'right', 'down', 'magnificent', 'stirring', 'Stephen', 'Oliver', 'Soundtrack.The', 'story', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'Grey', 'fill', 'period', 'time', 'players', 'English', 'Religious', 'bloodbath', 'occurred', 'time', 'Henry', 'V111', 'dies', 'first', 'daughter', 'Catholic', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'a.k.a', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'thrown', 'Protestant', 'Elizabeth', 'Queen', 'England.The', 'story', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'Grey', 'truly', 'saddest', 'IMO', 'all.Intelligent', 'well', 'read', 'fifteen', 'Jane', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'unwilling', 'pawn', 'parents', 'others', 'keep', 'Protestant', 'throne.She', 'forced', 'marry', 'Guilford', 'Dudley', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'reluctant', 'young', 'pawn', 'order', 'secure', 'English', 'Throne.Jane', 'Grey', 'parents', 'were', 'known', 'be', 'awful', 'Sara', 'Kestleman', 'Frances', 'Grey', 'cruel', 'sadistic', 'mother', 'could', 'be.The', 'screenplay', 'quite', 'direct', 'accessible', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'delineatedin', 'order', 'keep', 'very', 'central', 'story', 'moving', 'along.Historically', 'only', 'real', 'liberties', 'are', 'creation', 'assumption', 'what', 'lives', 'two', 'very', 'brief', 'nine', 'days', 'where', 'are', 'top', 'world', 'love', 'story', 'fabricated', '.who', 'cares', 'good', 'one', 'done', 'two', 'wonderful', 'young', 'actors', 'generation', 'nine', 'brief', 'days', 'Jane', 'ruled', 'England.Did', 'ever', 'really', 'want', 'Historians', 'director', 'Trevor', 'Nunn', 'resounding', 'say', 'NO', 'most', 'players', 'time', 'many', 'lost', 'heads', 'willingly', 'unwillingly', 'pursuing', 'fleeing', 'crown', 'rest', 'film', 'downright', 'accurate', 'quite', 'compelling.Of', 'English', 'monarch', 'films', 'put', 'LADY', 'JANE', 'head', 'should', 'say', 'headless', 'top', 'list.Anyone', 'who', 'topic', 'Catholic-Protestant', 'throne', 'trade-off', 'years', 'will', 'love', 'one.This', 'film', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'fine', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'educational', 'value.Chances', 'are', '..you', 'will', 'cry', 'history', 'quite', 'unfair', 'innocent', 'people']",Lady Jane VHS

213569,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6300214559,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 13]","One of the most interesting instances of genetic and gender in the history of Western Civilization is found with the death of King Edward VI of England at the age of 15 in 1553.  Too young to leave heirs, his older half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth Tudor were both considered illegitimate because of the martial history of their father Henry VIII.  Going through the Tudor family the only other potential claimants, Mary of Scotland and Lady Jane Grey, were also female.  It seemed that God that determined that a woman would sit on the throne of England and the political question was who that woman would be.  The one with the best claim was Mary Tudor, but she was a devout Catholic and the creation of the Anglican Church had created a religious schism in England that would turn ugly with her on the throne.Lady Jane first became connected with the English crown as a potential mate for young Edward, who was more interested in Mary of Scotland or another foreign princess.  Jane was supposedly betrothed to the duke of Somerset's son, Lord Hertford, but was then informed by her parents that she was to wed Guildford Dudley, the youngest son of the duke of Northumberland.  Handsome and only one year her senior, Jane did not like him and refused the marriage until her mother literally beat her into submission.  The couple were married in May of 1553 and lived apart, although the marriage was consummated the following month at the expressed command of Northumberland.  Jane was then informed that she had been named Edward's heir three days before the king's death.  Northumberland kept Edward's death a secret in order to stop Mary Tudor from claiming the crown and made a speech announcing Jane was the new queen.  Forced to accept the title, Jane dismissed the idea that her husband would be made king.  When Northumberland went forth with his army to meet that of Mary, who was marching on London, the royal council declared Mary queen and Jane's own father signed the declaration.  On November 13 Jane and Guildford we tried, convicted, and sentenced to death.  Jane believed the Queen would pardon her, but the revolt against Mary by Sir Thomas Wyatt in February 1554 hardened her heart against her enemies.  Within days Guildford was executed, with Jane being beheaded on February 11th.None of this historical information consistutes a spoiler because anyone familiar with the kings and queens of England knows that there was never a Queen Jane and even those unfamiliar with the specifics of English history will be aware early on that this is going to be a tragic tale.  Even so, the 1986 film &quot;Lady Jane&quot; from director Trevor Nunn would more properly be considered a historical romance, with the emphasis more on the romance than the history as the marriage between Jane (Helena Bonham Carter) and Guilford (Cary Elwes) is turned into a tragic love story.  Jane is presented as an intellectual (you would like to see her and Elizabeth Tudor have a conversation), and given a sense of nobility in that she and her husband apparently intend to rule in their own names, not only because it will thwart the plans of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland (John Wood), but also because it is the right thing to do.  In bed they tend to talk about their idealistic plans, such as not branding men or sending them into slavery because they are starving.This new version of Lady Jane's marriage and her new found political ambitions work to add to the tragedy of her execution at the hands of Bloody Mary, even though her being an unwilling pawn in the machinations of some one else's power games makes her enough of a tragic figure.  You have to appreciate the irony that these two privileged children of the British class system were idealistic friends of the common folk.  The cast features the standard collection of British character actors, with Michael Hordern as Doctor Feckenham, Mary's teacher, Jane Lapotaire as Princess Mary, Joss Ackland as Sir John Bridges, and Sara Kestleman as Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk and Jane's mother.  For me the low moment in the film is when Jane is betrayed by her father, especially since Patrick Stewart plays Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk.  Of course, both Bonham Carter and Elwes have gone on to much better films, although I was surprised that she made this after &quot;A Room With a View,&quot; one of those much better films. &quot;Lady Jane&quot; runs a bit long, especially given that Jane's &quot;reign&quot; only lasted nine days, and while the fictional romance has its moments I would hope that one day the bleak reality of what happened to this young girl becomes the subject of another film.",4,A historical tragedy turned into more of a fictional romance,1085875200,"05 30, 2004",2004,4669,"['One', 'most', 'interesting',

213570,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6300214559,Lawyeraau,"[6, 6]","This is a beautifully rendered period piece, with outstanding performances by the entire cast. A very young, petite and exquisite Helen Bonham Carter plays the title role of Lady Jane Grey, who was fifth in the line of succession to the throne of England upon the death of King Henry VIII in 1547. The first was Edward, King Henry VIII's only son. The second in the line of succession was Henry VIII's oldest daughter, Mary. The third was his other daughter, Elizabeth. The fourth was Lady Frances Grey, the Dutchess of Suffolk, and mother to Lady Jane Grey.Upon the death of King Henry VIII, his only son, nine year old Edward, became King Edward VI of England. His uncle, the Duke of Somerset, brother to Edward's mother, Jane Seymour, third wife of Henry VIII, ruled as Regent. In 1552, he was removed and beheaded. The ruthlessly ambitious John Dudley, the feared Duke of Northumberland, took his place as Regent. Here, the role of John Dudley is marvelously played with implacable and sinister resolve by John Wood.King Edward VI, touchingly played by William Saire, very much likes his cousin, the quiet, religious, and intelligent Lady Jane Grey, and treats her kindly. Both are devout believers in the Reformed Church. In fact, her ambitious mother, the Dutchess of Suffolk, marvelously played with icy malice by Sara Kestelman, expects that they will probably wed. She does not count on Edward dying a premature death. The Duke of Northumberland, however, knows that the King is ill and will probably die. He realizes that with Edward's death his Regency and all the power that such office confers will be no more.So, in the Spring of 1953, he tells Frances that the King is ill and likely to die and proposes to Frances that Jane, instead, marry his somewhat dissolute youngest son, Guilford, dashingly played by the very young and handsome, Cary Elwes. Together they intrigue, as they know that Mary, a staunch Catholic, is next in the line of succession. Dudley tells her that since she is the fourth in the line of succession that she waive her rights to her daughter, Jane, who is fifth in line. He will have Edward sign a decree making Jane his successor, under the pretext of keeping the Reformed Church in and the Catholic Church out. This way England will remain Protestant.When her parents, the Duke and Duchess of Suffolk, inform Jane of the proposed match, she protests and objects. After being beaten by her mother, she relents and marries Guilford. They fall in love as only the very young can, impractical and full of high ideals. Then, their bliss is rendered asunder, when the perfidy of both their parents becomes apparent upon the death of King Edward VI. Jane and Guilford are hustled out of their home and taken to Court. There, Jane is informed that Edward decreed her his successor. She becomes a most reluctant Queen at the age of sixteen. It was a reign that would last all of nine days.What happens to Jane and Guilford, as well as all the other players in this first class drama, is well worth watching. In addition to the those performances already noted, Jane LaPotaire is magnificent as Queen Mary, and Patrick Stewart is marvelous as Henry Grey, the Duke of Suffolk, Jane's father, whose ill advised action in seeking to restore Jane to the throne was the functional equivalent of signing her death warrant himself.

Most notably, Lady Jane and Guildford Dudley were not in love by any documents of the era, which renders the whole &quot;love story&quot; of this film invalid.But as a simple period piece I really love this movie, and here's why:1. Helena Bonham Carter gives a truly astonishing performance in her first movie.  This film began a string of &quot;period costume drama&quot; performances for the actress that have since been surplanted with modern roles such as &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;.  Her language - both spoken and simple gestures - are so expressive and she portrays a young woman who is well educated and full of passion.2. The central conflict at the end of the film comes in her unwillingness to give up her religious beliefs.  She is a protestant and her cousin, Queen Mary, is a staunch Catholic. Mary wants to make up for a lifetime of slights and abuses given to her Mother, Catherine of Aragon, whom Henry VIII divorced when Mary was unable to bear a male heir to Henry.  The real Lady Jane was not only a protestant, but carried on correspondence with the great protestant minds of her day including John Calvin.  It is not often that any popular form of entertainment is made depicting a person willing to die for their religious beliefs.  I am not advocating protestantism, per se, only admiring this film's willingness to demonstrate a strong faith which doesn't involve religious fanaticism.3. The real Guildford Dudley wasn't the love of Lady Jane, but Cary Elwes' performance here stands up well next to Bonham Carter's superlative one.  I suspect this role may have led to his being cast in &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;.Pretty much no extras on this DVD, but this is a truly fine film (albeit historically misleading), and it's not one of those $30 DVD's either.",5,Helena Bonham Carter is amazing in her film debut,1083801600,"05 6, 2004",2004,1919,"['noted', 'elsewhere', 'artistic', 'license', 'taken', 'actual', 'story', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'Grey', 'Most', 'notably', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'Guildford', 'Dudley', 'were', 'not', 'love', 'documents', 'era', 'whole', 'quot', 'story', 'quot', 'film', 'invalid.But', 'simple', 'period', 'piece', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'here', 'why:1', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'first', 'movie', 'film', 'began', 'string', 'quot', 'period', 'costume', 'drama', 'quot', 'performances', 'actress', 'have', 'been', 'surplanted', 'modern', 'roles', 'such', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'quot', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'quot', 'language', 'spoken', 'simple', 'gestures', 'are', 'so', 'expressive', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'well', 'educated', 'full', 'passion.2', 'central', 'conflict', 'end', 'film', 'unwillingness', 'give', 'up', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'protestant', 'cousin', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'staunch', 'Catholic', 'Mary', 'make', 'up', 'lifetime', 'slights', 'abuses', 'given', 'Mother', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'whom', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'divorced', 'when', 'Mary', 'was', 'unable', 'bear', 'male', 'heir', 'Henry', 'real', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'protestant', 'carried', 'correspondence', 'great', 'protestant', 'minds', 'day', 'including', 'John', 'Calvin', 'not', 'often', 'popular', 'form', 'entertainment', 'made', 'depicting', 'person', 'willing', 'die', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'am', 'not', 'advocating', 'protestantism', 'se', 'only', 'admiring', 'film', 'willingness', 'demonstrate', 'strong', 'faith', ""n't"", 'involve', 'religious', 'fanaticism.3', 'real', 'Guildford', 'Dudley', 'was', ""n't"", 'love', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'performance', 'here', 'up', 'well', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'superlative', 'one', 'suspect', 'role', 'may', 'have', 'led', 'being', 'cast', 'quot', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'quot', '.Pretty', 'much', 'extras', 'DVD', 'truly', 'fine', 'film', 'historically', 'misleading', 'not', 'one', '30', 'DVD']",Lady Jane VHS

In the case of poor little Jane Grey, one might just wish that her desperate and short life would at least have offered the comfort of such a passionate marriage as she gets here - which, alas, it didn't. Played out as a pawn in an elaborate succession ploy cooked up by her father-in-law, Jane was forced to marry a dispicable man, became queen for 9 days, and then, thanks to an inconceivably stupid eleventh hour rebellion by her father, went to the block with a calm dignity belying her mere 16 years. This movie has the gist of it, and makes for over two hours of good, solid entertainment. As costume drama goes, it is caught somewhere halfway between Errol Flynn and the BBC Virgin Queen. Sets and costumes are sumptuous if not quite historically correct (dresses, for instance, did not have all-round bodices, but were assembled from lots of bits and pieces pinned to the undergarments). Clearly, costumes were chosen for their dramatic effect, and as such work very well. Splendid Queen Mary in her red dress looks almost like Disney's witch Malificent, and the all white winter hunting party is very stylish indeed (though Star Trek reminiscenses are inevitable when Patrick Stewart appears in his stylized Tudor garments).The acting is altogether quite good, with Bonham Carter, unsurprisingly, taking the laurels. Elwes does all he can with the heavily romanticized version of Guildford Dudley on offer in this script. It is hardly his fault that the rapid transformation from dissolute drunkard and whoremonger into ardent lover and idealistic defender of the poor does not come across as quite believable (he does better with the drunkard than with the idealist, by the way). Sara Kestelman is excellent as Jane's cruel and selfisch mother, and John Wood even better as the sinister, scheming Northumberland. Warren Saire deserves mention too, for his sympathetic and moving portrayal of the doomed King Edward VI. Jane Lapotaire brings subtlety to Queen Mary's character, and succeeds in making it felt that this queen isn't up for a very happy reign either.This is a quiet movie, with a slow pace, that is carried by the believable chemistry between the two leads. It communicates a strong sense of the cruelty of those days, when death and disgrace were always lurking around the corner and individual fates counted for nothing. It does not eschew the clich&eacute;, to which it occassionally succumbs in rather silly ways (e.g., Jane muses on her impending death and a flock of birds flies by). The music is horribly bombastic and at times quite misplaced. Yet none of this results in serious damage, and the end, featuring a minute reconstruction of Jane's execution, may well leave you a little shaken; - the image of the blindfolded young girl desperatly groping for the block, is quite unsettling. In all, a worthwhile and interesting movie.",4,"Not an accurate  history lesson, but well-made and well-acted",1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,3030,"['History', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'stuff', 'movies', 'moviemakers', 'tend', 'add', 'bits', 'own', 'invention', 'make', 'palatable', 'moviegoing', 'audience', 'case', 'poor', 'little', 'Jane', 'Grey', 'one', 'might', 'just', 'wish', 'desperate', 'short', 'life', 'would', 'least', 'have', 'offered', 'comfort', 'such', 'passionate', 'marriage', 'here', 'alas', 'did', ""n't"", 'Played', 'out', 'pawn', 'elaborate', 'succession', 'ploy', 'cooked', 'up', 'father-in-law', 'Jane', 'was', 'forced', 'marry', 'dispicable', 'man', 'became', 'queen', '9', 'days', 'then', 'thanks', 'inconceivably', 'stupid', 'eleventh', 'hour', 'rebellion', 'father', 'went', 'block', 'calm', 'dignity', 'belying', 'mere', '16', 'years', 'movie', 'gist', 'two', 'hours', 'good', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'costume', 'drama', 'caught', 'somewhere', 'halfway', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'BBC', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'Sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'sumptuous', 'not', 'quite', 'historically', 'correct', 'dresses', 'instance', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'all-round', 'bodices', 'were', 'assembled', 'lots', 'bits', 'pieces', 'pinned', 'undergarments', 'Clearly', 'costumes', 'were', 'chosen', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'such', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'Splendid', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'red', 'dress', 'almost', 'Disney', 'witch', 'Malificent', 'white', 'winter', 'hunting', 'party', 'very', 'stylish', 'indeed', 'Star', 'Trek', 'reminiscenses', 'are', 'inevitable', 'when', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'stylized', 'Tudor', 'garments', '.The', 'acting', 'altogether', 'quite', 'good', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'unsurprisingly', 'taking', 'laurels', 'Elwes', 'can', 'heavily', 'romanticized', 'version', 'Guildford', 'Dudley', 'offer', 'script', 'hardly', 'fault', 'rapid', 'transformation', 'dissolute', 'drunkard', 'whoremonger', 'ardent', 'lover', 'idealistic', 'defender', 'poor', 'not', 'come', 'quite', 'believable', 'better', 'drunkard', 'idealist', 'way', 'Sara', 'Kestelman', 'excellent', 'Jane', 'cruel', 'selfisch', 'mother', 'John', 'Wood', 'even', 'better', 'sinister', 'scheming', 'Northumberland', 'Warren', 'Saire', 'mention', 'too', 'sympathetic', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'doomed', 'King', 'Edward', 'VI', 'Jane', 'Lapotaire', 'subtlety', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'character', 'making', 'felt', 'queen', ""n't"", 'up', 'very', 'happy', 'reign', 'either.This', 'quiet', 'movie', 'slow', 'pace', 'carried', 'believable', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'strong', 'sense', 'cruelty', 'days', 'when', 'death', 'disgrace', 'were', 'always', 'lurking', 'corner', 'individual', 'fates', 'counted', 'nothing', 'not', 'eschew', 'clich', 'eacute', 'occassionally', 'rather', 'silly', 'ways', 'e.g.', 'Jane', 'impending', 'death', 'flock', 'birds', 'flies', 'music', 'horribly', 'bombastic', 'times', 'quite', 'misplaced', 'none', 'results', 'serious', 'damage', 'end', 'featuring', 'minute', 'reconstruction', 'Jane', 'execution', 'may', 'well', 'leave', 'little', 'shaken', 'image', 'blindfolded', 'young', 'girl', 'desperatly', 'groping', 'block', 'quite', 'unsettling', 'worthwhile', 'interesting', 'movie']",Lady Jane VHS

Helena Bonham Carter plays a credible role as the young queen-to-be who is manipulated by the intrigues of her parents and others into assuming the throne. Cary Elwes plays a perhaps less convincing role as Guilford of Northumberland, a Don Giovanni type bachelor who is not in a hurry to get married for political reasons.The story seems to keep up its mood of historical drama until the prince and princess are united; it then almost desintegrates into a childish a fairy tale fantasy that is completely at odds with the drama. Prince and princess begin looking at the other with puppy eyes and dreaming silly things they would do. In short, the characters decend into a type of gibberish dialogue that can't possibly reflect the attitudes of those days. Fortunately,the tragic elements of history come to save the day and take Lady Jane Grey to the block.The filming is good as are the settings and costumes.

Made during the British film industry's dark days of the mid-80s in a failed attempt to recapture the audience for the likes of Anne of the Thousand Days and A Man For All Seasons, it was one of only two films made by Paramount's much-hyped British production arm before they shut up shop (the Ralph Fiennes-Juliette Binoche Wuthering Heights was the other). It may have opened to even more public indifference than Elizabeth: The Golden Age but it's rather better than you might expect even if it is never quite good enough.Lady Jane Grey's brief nine day reign as queen of England had been given a much-fictionalised screen treatment before in 1936's Tudor Rose, but this version had some (almost entirely unrealised) aspirations towards historical accuracy even if it does turn Jane and her wastrel husband Guildford Dudley (a name that sounds more like a bicycle race than a possible king) into doomed lovers when they hated each other all the way to the executioners' block. Both were very much puppets of their parents' ambitions: the dying young King Edward's protector Lord Dudley wanted to ensure the elevation of his own family from commoners to nobility to royalty under the guise of ensuring the succession of a Protestant monarch to protect the fledging Reformed Church, and the social-climbing Suffolks rather liked the idea of becoming royalty (though it was actually Jane's mother who had precedence in the line of succession) while their offspring had no say in the matter even if it was to cost them their lives. The film is at its best in showing the conflict between a young generation that had embraced the then-excitement and new ideas of a religion rejecting Rome and without arcane ritual and an older generation that had either profited handsomely from the dissolution of the monasteries or had suffered grievously and wanted to restore the old religion and with it the old status quo, although it never makes the obvious link between Jane's ferocious religious fanaticism and the unhappy, unloved childhood that appears to have driven her towards it in much the same way that the ostracised Queen Mary was drawn to her fanatical Catholicism.Unfortunately, Nunn's direction is even more of a major problem than a watered-down script. He's fine when people are talking, even if they're walking at the same time, yet any more complicated form of action seems completely beyond him. And in this case action doesn't just apply to a pub brawl that's shot like badly blocked and under-rehearsed 50s television but scenes like Lady Jane throwing a fit in a room and knocking the silverware on the floor while supporting players very, very slowly try not to catch up with her and stop her: the camera is in the wrong place, the timing wildly misjudged, the actors' movements horribly unconvincing. They're the kind of mistakes you'd expect from an amateur movie maker's first efforts, not someone with a decent budget and a cinematographer with as much experience as Douglas Slocombe to advise him, and they make you half-glad that the modest budget didn't stretch to filming the story's offscreen battles. He also gives away his theatre background by framing many shots as if for the proscenium arch, never really embracing the possibilities and freedom of the movie camera.Nor does he get the most out of some of the cast. Old pros like John Wood, Michael Hordern, Jane Lapatoire and Joss Ackland are fine (though most of the older actors have little, if anything, to do), as are Warren Saire as the dying young King Edward and, for the most part, Cary Elwes as young Dudley, but Bonham Carter's performance is particularly problematic. Looking even younger than her character's 16 years and nothing like the freckle-faced redhead of history, her performance is often awkward and fairly consistently unlikeable, making Jane less a tragic figure and more of a petulant Catholic-baiting little madam who got what was coming to her, a Tudor Wednesday Addams rather than a Tudor Rose. At times she looks less like a lost soul than a panicking inexperienced actress deliberately cast adrift without being told what she's supposed to do, desperately looking to the sidelines for help that's not forthcoming, all too often leaving you feeling sorry for the actress but nothing for the character. To be fair it seems to be more a problem of direction and it's not hard to guess which scenes were shot first from her awkwardness, although she visibly gains confidence as the film progresses.Yet it's not all bad. It does show what a disastrous queen she would have made, although the film does give the impression that Jane and Guilford were a pair of hippie libertarians - indeed, with its Romeo and Juliet love story and bucolic romantic montage sequence you almost get the impression that this was intended as a Franco Zeffirelli film a la Brother Sun, Sister Moon. Bonham Carter's brief scenes with Hordern's Dr Feckenham where they pit their faiths against each other are the best in the picture and it's a pity there aren't more of them in David Edgar's screenplay, while the end is touching despite being almost as clumsily staged as the real execution (it's a tastefully bloodless affair here, though, quite unlike the reports of the real thing: one observer was moved to note that he couldn't believe so much blood could come from such a small body). Stephen Oliver's excellent score is good enough to make it a genuine shame that he never got to write any more, adding him to that list of talented British composers like Marc Wilkinson and Raymond Leppard who never got the breaks their gifts deserved. At the end of the day it's a watchable enough period piece for a Sunday afternoon, but one that probably plays better on TV than it did on the big screen.The widescreen 1.85:1 DVD transfer is acceptable, though the stereo track impresses more. The only extra is a decent black and white stills gallery.",3,A watchable enough period piece that loses almost everything of interest in the true story,1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,6529,"['will',
