567622,ATJD01SS8NTJM,B000055ZEZ,booboo bear,"[1, 7]",The best thing about this sad excuse for an underground seventies cartoon is that no one is forcing you to watch it. I mean it's not like a scene from Clockwork Orange where the viewer is strapped in and their eyes propped open with coat hangers. That's the best thing about it. There are a few (maybe four even) moments of humor so crude it's funny but most of it isn't. So much for the movie's good points.The animation is not only amateur it's deliberately lame which would make it a good match for the meandering/scattered writing that tries to pass as plot if such a match up could actually be thought of as desirable. It isn't! The combination teams up to make anyone wonder why they are subjecting themselves to this poorly animated passing of gas. Tiny bits of the musical soundtrack actually might have been turned into something (not sure what) if anyone associated with this project gave a damn which obviously no one did.A couple of reviewers have suggested smoking something fairly pungent before watching Dirty Duck but I'd suggest a much more powerful narcotic. Maybe a half pan of brownies but a proper antidote for this boring animated mess probably lay somewhere in the truly psychedelic category. If you have too much respect for your body to do that then show your mind the same and don't bother with this movie.,2,Why bother?,1201305600,"01 26, 2008",2008,1332,"['best', 'thing', 'sad', 'excuse', 'underground', 'seventies', 'cartoon', 'one', 'forcing', 'watch', 'mean', 'not', 'scene', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'where', 'viewer', 'strapped', 'eyes', 'propped', 'open', 'coat', 'hangers', 'best', 'thing', 'are', 'few', 'maybe', 'four', 'even', 'moments', 'humor', 'crude', 'funny', 'most', ""n't"", 'So', 'much', 'movie', 'good', 'points.The', 'animation', 'not', 'only', 'deliberately', 'lame', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'match', 'meandering/scattered', 'writing', 'pass', 'plot', 'such', 'match', 'up', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'thought', 'desirable', ""n't"", 'combination', 'up', 'make', 'anyone', 'wonder', 'why', 'are', 'subjecting', 'poorly', 'animated', 'passing', 'gas', 'Tiny', 'bits', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'actually', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'something', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'anyone', 'associated', 'project', 'gave', 'damn', 'obviously', 'one', 'couple', 'reviewers', 'have', 'suggested', 'smoking', 'something', 'fairly', 'pungent', 'watching', 'Dirty', 'Duck', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'narcotic', 'Maybe', 'half', 'pan', 'brownies', 'proper', 'antidote', 'boring', 'animated', 'mess', 'probably', 'lay', 'somewhere', 'truly', 'psychedelic', 'category', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'respect', 'body', 'do', 'then', 'show', 'mind', 'same', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'movie']",Dirty Duck

Willard ends up taking the duck along with him after a bizzar predicted death. The duck ends up taking willard of a pointless journery that looks like its a combo of Fritz the cat and the beatles Yellow submarine processed in a blender, mix in some really low (but funny) humor. Then journy comes to a end that has to be one of the most messed up and twisted ending ever, you will have to see this movie for yourself. The movie as a hole dosen't really hold well and is really poorly animated and voice casted but that is half the point it even says so in the opening song. Most of this movie's score is made up from flo and eddie former members of the band  The turltles (and don't let their pop friendly past fool you their music in the flick is raw and funny, almost trey parker in style but way befor his time. I highly recomend this to any stoner who wants to trip to a movie. This movie works on all levels though.
