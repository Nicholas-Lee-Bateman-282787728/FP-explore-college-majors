1002241,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B000GEIRAA,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[4, 4]","Taury, Patsy, Sid and Trike, Pterence, Steggy, what a sight!It's ""Harry and His Bucket Full of Dinosaurs"" --- for the first time ever on DVD! If you and/or your kids haven't already, it's time to 1 2 3 jump into this fantastic series in which Harry visits a land of imagination called Dino World. Harry has a very special bucket of dinosaurs, which he got from his Nana. These dinosaurs are no ordinary dinosaur toys --- around Harry and his friend Charley (/Charlie --- the spelling is never consistent) these dinosaurs actually come to life. These dinosaurs are loaded with personally. There's Patsy --- a kindly female dinosaur who's fond of using unusual phrases such as ""It's hotter than a firecracker in July!"" As a pterodactyl, Pterence is a flier. He's often shy and hesitant to speak up, but his wings give him a huge advantage when it comes to sports and certain other tasks. Steggy is a worrywart and something of a hypochondriac. He never jumps in head-first, but is also ready for fun like the other dinosaurs.Three down, three to go. Taury is a Tyrannosaurus Rex, but hardly a fearsome tyrant. He's an absolute fun-lover and something of a leader. Sid is a cool and analytical type. He wears glasses and knows a lot, but he certainly doesn't know it all. ""My calculations indicate that the risk of danger is far less than the risk of fun"" is a typical Sid statement. Finally, Trike is a triceratops. He's somewhat of a comic personality, often taking hard knocks. His large horns sometimes pose problems for him.Based on a series of books by Ian Whybrow, ""Harry"" premiered in the United States on Cartoon Network's ""Tickle U"" block. That block no longer exists, but they still air the show from time-to-time. In each episode, Harry and his dinosaurs explore topics that range from everything from not wanting to take a bath to having a cold and not being well enough to play. This DVD features five stories, which I'll give brief summaries of:""Aaagh!""Harry is scared by a monster, and doesn't even know where it came from. He thinks he'll be safe from the monster in Dino World, but once there, it shows up and starts chasing him.""Overdue!""Harry has an overdue library book about dinosaurs. He loves the book so much that he never wants to return it. But when he takes it to Dino World to hide it, it comes to life and insists on being returned to the library!""Uh-Oh!""Harry gets into time-tripping trouble when he breaks his mother's favorite teacup. He and his friend Charley/Charlie jump into Dino World to try to fix it, but end up trying to turn the hands of time.""Nobody's Listening to Me!""When Harry feels that nobody is listening to his story, he heads to Dino World to find someone who will. His dinosaurs follow, but when they all start arguing, they lose their voices. The voices end up in a big ball in Echo Canyon, overseen by a frog with a southern-drawl named Clem.""Goal!""Harry won't play fair at soccer. Charley/Charlie isn't very good at it (yet) and Harry tries to leave her out.If any of this sounds like fun to you or your kids, then ""Harry"" is definitely a show worth watching. The animation is extremely fun and eye-catching to watch and the stories convey a true sense of fun and laughter that truly fit with that Tickle U block (which was all about shows designed to help kids laugh.) And this show teaches excellent lessons as well.Oh --- and the episodes featured on this DVD are close-captioned with Dolby Digital sound. It doesn't have any special features except trailers for other shows, but it's still a neat DVD.",5,"Stegosaurus, Pterodactyl, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Scelidosaurus, Apatosaurus, Triceratops is Next",1165536000,"12 8, 2006",2006,3557,"['Taury', 'Patsy', 'Sid', 'Trike', 'Pterence', 'Steggy', 'what', 'sight', 'Harry', 'Bucket', 'Full', 'Dinosaurs', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'DVD', 'and/or', 'kids', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'time', '1', '2', '3', 'jump', 'fantastic', 'series', 'Harry', 'land', 'imagination', 'called', 'Dino', 'World', 'Harry', 'very', 'special', 'bucket', 'dinosaurs', 'got', 'Nana', 'dinosaurs', 'are', 'ordinary', 'dinosaur', 'toys', 'Harry', 'friend', 'Charley', '/Charlie', 'spelling', 'never', 'consistent', 'dinosaurs', 'actually', 'come', 'life', 'dinosaurs', 'are', 'loaded', 'personally', 'Patsy', 'kindly', 'female', 'dinosaur', 'who', 'fond', 'using', 'unusual', 'phrases', 'such', 'hotter', 'firecracker', 'July', 'pterodactyl', 'Pterence', 'flier', 'often', 'shy', 'hesitant', 'speak', 'up', 'wings', 'give', 'huge', 'advantage', 'when', 'sports', 'certain', 'other', 'tasks', 'Steggy', 'worrywart', 'something', 'hypochondriac', 'never', 'head-first', 'also', 'ready', 'fun', 'other', 'dinosaurs.Three', 'down', 'three', 'go', 'Taury', 'Tyrannosaurus', 'Rex', 'hardly', 'fearsome', 'tyrant', 'absolute', 'fun-lover', 'something', 'leader', 'Sid', 'cool', 'analytical', 'type', 'glasses', 'lot', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'know', 'calculations', 'indicate', 'risk', 'danger', 'far', 'less', 'risk', 'fun', 'typical', 'Sid', 'statement', 'Finally', 'Trike', 'triceratops', 'somewhat', 'comic', 'personality', 'often', 'taking', 'hard', 'knocks', 'large', 'horns', 'sometimes', 'pose', 'problems', 'him.Based', 'series', 'books', 'Ian', 'Whybrow', 'Harry', 'premiered', 'United', 'States', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Tickle', 'U', 'block', 'block', 'no', 'longer', 'still', 'air', 'show', 'time-to-time', 'episode', 'Harry', 'dinosaurs', 'explore', 'topics', 'range', 'everything', 'not', 'wanting', 'take', 'bath', 'having', 'cold', 'not', 'being', 'well', 'enough', 'play', 'DVD', 'five', 'stories', ""'ll"", 'give', 'brief', 'summaries', 'Aaagh', 'Harry', 'scared', 'monster', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'came', ""'ll"", 'be', 'safe', 'monster', 'Dino', 'World', 'once', 'there', 'up', 'chasing', 'him.', 'Overdue', 'Harry', 'overdue', 'library', 'book', 'dinosaurs', 'book', 'so', 'much', 'never', 'return', 'when', 'Dino', 'World', 'hide', 'life', 'insists', 'being', 'returned', 'library', 'Uh-Oh', 'Harry', 'time-tripping', 'trouble', 'when', 'mother', 'favorite', 'teacup', 'friend', 'Charley/Charlie', 'jump', 'Dino', 'World', 'try', 'fix', 'end', 'up', 'trying', 'turn', 'hands', 'time', 'Nobody', 'Listening', 'Me', 'When', 'Harry', 'nobody', 'listening', 'story', 'Dino', 'World', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'dinosaurs', 'follow', 'when', 'start', 'arguing', 'lose', 'voices', 'voices', 'end', 'up', 'big', 'ball', 'Echo', 'Canyon', 'overseen', 'frog', 'southern-drawl', 'named', 'Clem.', 'Goal', 'Harry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'fair', 'soccer', 'Charley/Charlie', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'yet', 'Harry', 'leave', 'out.If', 'like', 'fun', 'kids', 'then', 'Harry', 'definitely', 'show', 'worth', 'watching', 'animation', 'extremely', 'fun', 'eye-catching', 'watch', 'stories', 'convey', 'true', 'sense', 'fun', 'laughter', 'truly', 'fit', 'Tickle', 'U', 'block', 'was', 'shows', 'designed', 'help', 'kids', 'show', 'excellent', 'lessons', 'well.Oh', 'episodes', 'featured', 'DVD', 'are', 'close-captioned', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'sound', ""n't"", 'have', 'special', 'features', 'trailers', 'other', 'shows', 'still', 'neat', 'DVD']",Harry & His Bucket Full of Dinosaurs - To Dino World and Back!

It's just one of those really fun shows that brings out the kid in you. Who didn't have dino toys as a kid and enjoyed playing with them. My favorite episodes were ""Hail To The Queen.""I'm Sure Patsy was very amused and entertained by seeing Trike dancing in a female belly dancer's outfit.(Poor Trikem He Was Really Embarassed.) Then there was the episode titled ""But I Like Mud."" You gotta laugh when Harry loved mud soo much that he refused to take a bath, and got sooo stinky and smelly, that his dino friends didn't want to play with him. Then, in the episode of ""So What Happens Next"" Harry is read a bedtime story by his Nanna, and imagines himself in the story. He eats a magic apple and gets turned into a frog, and the only way he can be changed back to himself is by getting a kiss from a princess. Harry as a frog then says that he'd rather eat flies than be kissed by a princess.""I was hoping that this show would've been further merchandised, but even Target is no longer carrying the show's products, unless your lucky enough to find something. I've even e-mailed the producers from the Tickle U website when it was up and running asking if there was going to be future plans of the show performing live on stage. They told me no, but how cool would've it been to see the show live on stage.
