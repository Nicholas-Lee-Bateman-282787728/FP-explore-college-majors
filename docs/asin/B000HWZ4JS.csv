It was such a beautiful show, encompassing not just the Christian religion, but all religions. God is always referred to as ""The One True God"". Some of the shows hit right on target such as ""Monica Has A Bad Day"". That show was all about how one act by one person can touch off a string of events, either good or not. You can watch the show with young children. My children will make fun of it at times ( after all teenagers have to be cool) yet will sit and watch. My grown daughters when all come to my house at once settle in with snacks and we will watch episode after episode. I do not think there are any shows now that portray anything like this. And Della Reese, I love her and would like to see her on something now, she is such a warm person.
