976087,A2NKQ3C9LJZFIB,B000EPFCXG,"C. D. Howard ""Movielover""","[4, 5]","I thought that, as far as true stories go, this was one of the best.  How much you feel what Jim and Jennifer felt towards each other.  Here you have two young people, newly married with a newborn infant, who are so much in love.  Jim is in the army and barely makes ends meet when catastrophy strikes.  His grandmother dies in Idaho.  Jim takes leave, they borrow Jennifer's brother's truck and head up into the mountains to attend the funeral. But, they get detoured and end up stranded in the wild life preserve for 10 days.  They see their baby dieing before their eyes and feel hopeless.  Jim, seeing they have no time left, leaves his wife and child in a cave and attempts to walk the 80 miles to get help.  How nice it is to see just how many miles love can take you.  Very good tv movie!!!!",5,Snow Bound,1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,798,"['thought', 'that', 'as', 'far', 'true', 'stories', 'go', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'How', 'much', 'feel', 'what', 'Jim', 'Jennifer', 'felt', 'towards', 'other', 'Here', 'have', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'newly', 'married', 'newborn', 'infant', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'Jim', 'army', 'barely', 'ends', 'meet', 'when', 'catastrophy', 'strikes', 'grandmother', 'Idaho', 'Jim', 'leave', 'borrow', 'Jennifer', 'brother', 'truck', 'head', 'up', 'mountains', 'attend', 'funeral', 'get', 'detoured', 'end', 'up', 'stranded', 'wild', 'life', 'preserve', '10', 'days', 'see', 'baby', 'dieing', 'eyes', 'feel', 'hopeless', 'Jim', 'seeing', 'have', 'time', 'left', 'wife', 'child', 'cave', 'attempts', 'walk', '80', 'miles', 'get', 'help', 'How', 'nice', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'miles', 'love', 'can', 'take', 'Very', 'good', 'tv', 'movie']",N/A
