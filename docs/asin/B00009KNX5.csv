We miss Mother Bailey and Grace who are in Europe trying to claim and bring home the body of Grace's dead husband killed in pre-WWII Europe. They never make it home for Christmas, but the other cast of characters are there.The characters have grown and have learned important things about themselves and their beliefs -- about what they're willing to do and fight for. All the adventure settles around being home for Christmas, but when a life is at stake, Hub is unafraid and brings the fellow student home. The friend is a young womanYou come to find out she is not from Austria as claimed, but is, instead, a Jew in Canada without proper papers. A RCMP Officer is after her to deport her out of Canada.Family squabbles ensue as members recognize the worth of change displayed. It is a touching Christmas story, but not in the traditional sense. Still, very enjoyable with moment laughter and fun.",4,Bringing Closure to A Series and Sharing a Final Christmas with Us.,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,961,"['DVD', 'bring', 'closure', 'wonderful', 'Canadian', 'series', 'miss', 'Mother', 'Bailey', 'Grace', 'who', 'are', 'Europe', 'trying', 'claim', 'bring', 'home', 'body', 'Grace', 'dead', 'husband', 'killed', 'pre-WWII', 'Europe', 'never', 'make', 'home', 'Christmas', 'other', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'there.The', 'characters', 'have', 'grown', 'have', 'learned', 'important', 'things', 'beliefs', 'what', ""'re"", 'willing', 'do', 'fight', 'adventure', 'being', 'home', 'Christmas', 'when', 'life', 'stake', 'Hub', 'unafraid', 'fellow', 'student', 'home', 'friend', 'young', 'womanYou', 'come', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'Austria', 'claimed', 'instead', 'Jew', 'Canada', 'proper', 'papers', 'RCMP', 'Officer', 'deport', 'Canada.Family', 'squabbles', 'ensue', 'members', 'recognize', 'worth', 'change', 'displayed', 'touching', 'Christmas', 'story', 'not', 'traditional', 'sense', 'Still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'moment', 'laughter', 'fun']",A Wind At My Back Christmas
753800,A2N4PJBSMMSULP,B00009KNX5,"lady victoria ""vickl1""","[4, 5]","I loved the ""Wind at My Back"" series and was eager to see this ""sequel.""  Also the plot of the story interested me.  I loved Hub's new girlfriend Anna and I thought that the boys turned out very handsome.  I really want Hub to get together with Anna rather than Maisie who was always a little hooligan, but given the differences in their faiths, they may not be able to.  I would really like another episode to this story.Since I only watched two seasons of the five season series, I don't understand everything about the characters and their situations in THIS movie.  For instance, Toppy is back, but where is her husband Bob and her daughter Doris?  Toppy mentions that they have grown apart, but I would like to know more.  Another Character missing is Max's brother, Del Sutton.  At the end of season 2, it looks as if he and Grace will make a match of it, but Grace writes in here about someone named Van being her husband and his being killed or missing in the Spanish Civil War. Just who did Grace marry, and what happened to Del?  I assume that Mrs. Mae Bailey married Maisie McGinty's grandfather; why else would Maisie be staying with Toppy at the Bailey house, but what happened to the Bailey mine that went under at the end of season 2?  They need to get Season 3 on DVD pronto!The only thing that really disappointed me about this movie was the character of Honey Bailey.  The actress portraying her here is so glum looking, always scowling compared to Cynthia Belleveau's Honey.  And she acts totally out of character, wanting desperately for Hub to join the priesthood.  She acts a good deal like Mae Bailey did in the series, wanting to have a say in the boys' careers and disliking a girl because of her faith.  I would think she would sympathize with Anna; after all, Honey was looked down on by the Baileys for being Catholic!  Toppy, always the snob in the series, was the liberal-minded one here.  Because of these inconsistancies, I deduct a star.  Still an enjoyable movie.  Bring on Season 3 of ""Wind at My Back!""",4,Left me with a few questions,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,2038,"['loved', 'Wind', 'My', 'Back', 'series', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'sequel', 'Also', 'plot', 'story', 'interested', 'loved', 'Hub', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Anna', 'thought', 'boys', 'turned', 'out', 'very', 'handsome', 'really', 'want', 'Hub', 'get', 'together', 'Anna', 'rather', 'Maisie', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'little', 'hooligan', 'given', 'differences', 'faiths', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'episode', 'story.Since', 'only', 'watched', 'two', 'seasons', 'five', 'season', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'everything', 'characters', 'situations', 'THIS', 'movie', 'instance', 'Toppy', 'back', 'where', 'husband', 'Bob', 'daughter', 'Doris', 'Toppy', 'mentions', 'have', 'grown', 'apart', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'more', 'Character', 'missing', 'Max', 'brother', 'Del', 'Sutton', 'end', 'season', '2', 'Grace', 'will', 'make', 'match', 'Grace', 'here', 'someone', 'named', 'Van', 'being', 'husband', 'being', 'killed', 'missing', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'Just', 'who', 'did', 'Grace', 'marry', 'what', 'happened', 'Del', 'assume', 'Mrs.', 'Mae', 'Bailey', 'married', 'Maisie', 'McGinty', 'grandfather', 'why', 'else', 'would', 'Maisie', 'be', 'staying', 'Toppy', 'Bailey', 'house', 'what', 'happened', 'Bailey', 'mine', 'went', 'end', 'season', '2', 'need', 'get', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'pronto', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'was', 'character', 'Honey', 'Bailey', 'actress', 'portraying', 'here', 'so', 'glum', 'looking', 'always', 'scowling', 'compared', 'Cynthia', 'Belleveau', 'Honey', 'totally', 'character', 'wanting', 'desperately', 'Hub', 'join', 'priesthood', 'good', 'deal', 'Mae', 'Bailey', 'did', 'series', 'wanting', 'have', 'say', 'boys', 'careers', 'disliking', 'girl', 'faith', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'sympathize', 'Anna', 'Honey', 'was', 'looked', 'down', 'Baileys', 'being', 'Catholic', 'Toppy', 'always', 'snob', 'series', 'was', 'liberal-minded', 'one', 'here', 'inconsistancies', 'deduct', 'star', 'Still', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Bring', 'Season', '3', 'Wind', 'My', 'Back']",A Wind At My Back Christmas

I loved the movie...great characters, gives a great feeling of the good parts of that era and a small glimpse at the horrible fear that came with reign of Hitler (a glance into the minds of those who feared him and those who thought he was just a crazy leader who would never have the power to be a danger to the world-those who were afraid to get involved, and those who risked thier lives to help a Jewish girl escape a Canadian deportation order.Yet it was still an incredibly uplifting, family movie. People of all faiths should watch this movie to remind us all how dangerous it is to assume that the leader of a country who wants an entire population to die could not have the power to enact his vile plan.  If enough people fear him and enough people ignore him because he is apparently not a danger to anyone, horrendous things can happen.A really terrific movie about the spirit of Christmas.",5,Great Christmas movie!!!,1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,1142,"['had', 'considered', 'getting', 'series', '6', 'months', 'ago', 'was', 'little', 'pricey', 'when', 'looking', 'few', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'thought', ""'d"", 'try', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'cheaper', 'way', 'preview', 'series', 'buying', 'season', 'one', 'loved', 'movie', 'great', 'characters', 'great', 'feeling', 'good', 'parts', 'era', 'small', 'glimpse', 'horrible', 'fear', 'came', 'reign', 'Hitler', 'glance', 'minds', 'who', 'feared', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'crazy', 'leader', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'power', 'be', 'danger', 'world-those', 'who', 'were', 'afraid', 'get', 'involved', 'who', 'risked', 'thier', 'lives', 'help', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'escape', 'Canadian', 'deportation', 'was', 'still', 'incredibly', 'uplifting', 'family', 'movie', 'People', 'faiths', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'remind', 'how', 'dangerous', 'assume', 'leader', 'country', 'who', 'entire', 'population', 'die', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'power', 'enact', 'vile', 'plan', 'enough', 'people', 'fear', 'enough', 'people', 'ignore', 'apparently', 'not', 'danger', 'anyone', 'horrendous', 'things', 'can', 'happen.A', 'really', 'terrific', 'movie', 'spirit', 'Christmas']",A Wind At My Back Christmas
