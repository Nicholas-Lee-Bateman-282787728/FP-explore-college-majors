1536534,A2RFK1JEOAUQMB,B007REV4LQ,"Aaron Mills "".""","[2, 6]","2 psychopaths turn out to be 1 psychopath. Another psychopath is completely made up for script in this film. Even overlooking what the title clearly advertises to the viewer, this movie is just plain boring, unrealistic and feels like a amateurish beginner's attempt at script writing at a film school which is understandable for students, but not for directors. By the way, the trailer for Martin McDonagh's Seven Psychopaths lists off several characters that were not actually psychopaths in the Seven Psychopaths (both girls and the, &#34;Seemingly normal,&#34; guy who is just a dorky writer caught in the middle of the plot).Before I continue, note that I will count what the movie counted as psychopaths as I describe the plot to you. The plot starts with these 2 guys trying to write script for a film that they only have the title for (Seven Psychopaths), but one writer is secretly a serial killer and psychopath (1) who has knowingly stolen a dog and girlfriend from a gangster boss (2) while disguised as another mysterious psychopathic serial killer dressed in all black with a red scarf (3). Along the way, the writer and his friend (supposedly the writer's co-writer) write about a fictional psychopath who was formally a Vietcong soldier in the Vietnam War (4), interview an old serial killer (5) who once had a girlfriend (6) whom he traveled around with to kill famous serial killers and another self-mutilating psychopath (7) who tags along with the writer and his crazy friend throughout the story for the sake of having Christopher Walken in the movie and nothing more. The 2 friends and Christopher Walken are basically trying to outrun the gangster boss psychopath who wants his beloved dog back that the writer's friend stole. Contrary to the film's advertisement, the gangster boss' girlfriend and the writer's girlfriend are small side characters at best. However, the writer's crazy friend, supposed fellow writer and secret serial killer who dresses up in an all-black disguise is counted as 2 psychopaths, but I do not count this 1 psychopath as 2. The Vietcong psychopath is a fictional character made up for a writer's movie script in Seven Psychopaths. Even if it turned out that the Vietcong psychopath was based on a real person, it's hearsay at best in the film and, other than being mentioned occasionally, the Vietcong psychopath is pointless and not very entertaining overall.There isn't much chaos or mayhem, it's not really that funny, most of the characters aren't really that psychotic and the ending is stupid and doesn't make much sense in director Martin McDonagh's dull and lacking Seven Psychopaths film. As dishonest as the advertisement is, the advertisement was way more entertaining than the actual movie itself.",1,Martin McDonagh Owes Me 2 Psycho's & A Good Movie,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,2762,"['2', 'psychopaths', 'turn', 'out', 'be', '1', 'psychopath', 'psychopath', 'completely', 'made', 'up', 'script', 'film', 'Even', 'overlooking', 'what', 'title', 'clearly', 'viewer', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'unrealistic', 'feels', 'amateurish', 'beginner', 'attempt', 'script', 'writing', 'film', 'school', 'understandable', 'students', 'not', 'directors', 'way', 'trailer', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'several', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'actually', 'psychopaths', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'girls', '34', 'Seemingly', 'normal', '34', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'dorky', 'writer', 'caught', 'middle', 'plot', '.Before', 'continue', 'note', 'will', 'count', 'what', 'movie', 'counted', 'as', 'psychopaths', 'describe', 'plot', 'plot', '2', 'guys', 'trying', 'write', 'script', 'film', 'only', 'have', 'title', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'one', 'writer', 'secretly', 'serial', 'killer', 'psychopath', '1', 'who', 'knowingly', 'stolen', 'dog', 'girlfriend', 'gangster', 'boss', '2', 'while', 'disguised', 'mysterious', 'psychopathic', 'serial', 'killer', 'dressed', 'black', 'red', 'scarf', '3', 'way', 'writer', 'friend', 'supposedly', 'writer', 'co-writer', 'write', 'fictional', 'psychopath', 'who', 'was', 'formally', 'Vietcong', 'soldier', 'Vietnam', 'War', '4', 'interview', 'old', 'serial', 'killer', '5', 'who', 'once', 'had', 'girlfriend', '6', 'whom', 'traveled', 'around', 'kill', 'famous', 'serial', 'killers', 'self-mutilating', 'psychopath', '7', 'who', 'writer', 'crazy', 'friend', 'story', 'sake', 'having', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', '2', 'friends', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'are', 'basically', 'trying', 'outrun', 'gangster', 'psychopath', 'who', 'beloved', 'dog', 'back', 'writer', 'friend', 'stole', 'Contrary', 'film', 'advertisement', 'gangster', 'boss', 'girlfriend', 'writer', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'small', 'side', 'characters', 'best', 'However', 'writer', 'crazy', 'friend', 'supposed', 'fellow', 'writer', 'secret', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'up', 'all-black', 'disguise', 'counted', '2', 'psychopaths', 'do', 'not', 'count', '1', 'psychopath', '2', 'Vietcong', 'psychopath', 'fictional', 'character', 'made', 'up', 'writer', 'movie', 'script', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'Even', 'turned', 'out', 'Vietcong', 'psychopath', 'was', 'based', 'real', 'person', 'hearsay', 'best', 'film', 'other', 'being', 'mentioned', 'occasionally', 'Vietcong', 'psychopath', 'pointless', 'not', 'very', 'entertaining', ""n't"", 'much', 'chaos', 'mayhem', 'not', 'really', 'funny', 'most', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'psychotic', 'ending', 'stupid', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'director', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'dull', 'lacking', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'film', 'As', 'dishonest', 'advertisement', 'advertisement', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'entertaining', 'actual', 'movie']",Seven Psychopaths

The movie has a Quentin Tarantino feel with its action, fast-paced motion of character progression, and dialogue-heavy conversations of a witty nature. The movie is also star-studded with big names showing up every which way, and in surprisingly small (and large) roles. Christopher Walken, as usual, steals the show with his stupendous acting that could crush the world with its might.All-in-all, the movie isn't going to win best picture - but it's action packed, hilarious, and acted well and just down-right FUN.

1536536,ASZGADJQT6ET4,B007REV4LQ,Adam Gagnon,"[0, 1]","From my site [...]A movie that is amazing as the concept is bizarre. Seven Psychopaths is well made, full of action, and absolutely hilarious.Marty (Colin Farrell) is an alcoholic screen writer with a terrible case of writers block. Marty&#8217;s friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) is very encouraging and constantly tries to help Marty with his screen play. It is clear that Marty doesn&#8217;t respect Billy, and seeing the strange things Billy does, it is not all that surprising. Billy hangs out with a man named Hans (Christopher Walken). The two abduct dogs and hang on to them until the owners offer a reward. They then turn up and act innocent while returning the dog to collect the reward. Their relatively harmless plan takes a dark turn when Billy kidnaps Bonny, the shih tzu owned by a mob boss named Charlie (Woody Harrelson). The movie never stops moving and it moves quickly at that. Keeping up this pace for two hours is a huge credit to director Martin McDonagh. As the story unfolds it is told not only in the world of Marty, Billy, Hans, and Charlie but also in Marty&#8217;s head as he works his way through the screen play he is working on. As Marty&#8217;s situation becomes more chaotic the barrier between the two worlds starts to seriously blur.Colin Farrell doesn&#8217;t always make a hit but he is an actor who always tries hard. In this case his persistent hard work absolutely pays off since Psychopaths is an amazing movie. Farrell also stared in Martin McDonagh&#8217;s previous movie &#8220;In Bruges&#8221; (also a 5/5). Farrell isn&#8217;t quite the audience perspective or voice of reason in Psychopaths but he is the closest tether to reality the audience is given as they try to keep up with the insane actions of the rest of the movie&#8217;s characters. Sam Rockwell is the most far-out character by far. Despite Rockwell&#8217;s outrageous actions and ideas he is never guilty of chewing the scenery. He pushes his character to the limits but keeps control just enough to be amazing. Rockwell steals every scene he is in and proves yet again he is an actor who can handle any script that is given to him. Christopher Walken also delivers an impressive performance. It seems in recent years that Walken had essentially become a parody of himself and showed up in a lot of really terrible movies just so idiot teenagers would laugh at his distinct speech pattern. Walken is anything but a joke in Psychopaths. He is also out of the norm but at the same time a very calculated man who things about his actions and what he says, Walken gets some of the most shudder-ingly impressive scenes in the movie. Woody Harrelson is always a fan favorite despite most of his performances being very middle of the road. He never disappoints but never blows the audience away. Harrelson&#8217;s role in psychopaths is a good one and definitely plays to Harrelson&#8217;s strengths.The script deserves a lot of credit for all the characters in the movie, it is clear they weren&#8217;t created by the actors but the actors certainly brought them to life. With a lesser cast and crew this script, while obviously very strong, could have been pushed into the realm of far too ridiculous and fell flat on it&#8217;s face. The serious subject matter, brutal violence, and perfect blend of comedy are all proof of how strong the screen play really was.Seven Psychopaths is a rare combination of fairly serious subject matter and outright hilarious comedy. The jokes are smart, the dialogue snaps, and the actors are flawless. Martin McDonagh took an incredibly strong script and molded it into an absolute master piece.",5,My Seven Psychopaths Review,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,3631,"['site', '[', 'movie', 'amazing', 'concept', 'bizarre', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'well', 'made', 'full', 'action', 'absolutely', 'hilarious.Marty', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'alcoholic', 'screen', 'writer', 'terrible', 'case', 'writers', 'block', 'Marty', '8217', 'friend', 'Billy', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'very', 'encouraging', 'constantly', 'help', 'Marty', 'screen', 'play', 'clear', 'Marty', 'doesn', '8217', 'respect', 'Billy', 'seeing', 'strange', 'things', 'Billy', 'not', 'surprising', 'Billy', 'out', 'man', 'named', 'Hans', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'two', 'abduct', 'dogs', 'hang', 'owners', 'offer', 'reward', 'then', 'turn', 'up', 'act', 'innocent', 'returning', 'dog', 'collect', 'reward', 'relatively', 'harmless', 'plan', 'dark', 'turn', 'when', 'Billy', 'Bonny', 'shih', 'tzu', 'owned', 'mob', 'boss', 'named', 'Charlie', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'movie', 'never', 'moving', 'quickly', 'Keeping', 'up', 'pace', 'two', 'hours', 'huge', 'credit', 'director', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'story', 'told', 'not', 'only', 'world', 'Marty', 'Billy', 'Hans', 'Charlie', 'also', 'Marty', '8217', 's', 'head', 'way', 'screen', 'play', 'working', 'Marty', '8217', 'situation', 'more', 'chaotic', 'barrier', 'two', 'worlds', 'seriously', 'blur.Colin', 'Farrell', 'doesn', '8217', 'always', 'make', 'hit', 'actor', 'who', 'always', 'hard', 'case', 'persistent', 'hard', 'work', 'absolutely', 'Psychopaths', 'amazing', 'movie', 'Farrell', 'also', 'stared', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', '8217', 'previous', 'movie', '8220', 'Bruges', '8221', 'also', '5/5', 'Farrell', 'isn', '8217', 'quite', 'audience', 'perspective', 'voice', 'reason', 'Psychopaths', 'closest', 'tether', 'reality', 'audience', 'given', 'try', 'keep', 'up', 'insane', 'actions', 'rest', 'movie', '8217', 's', 'characters', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'most', 'far-out', 'character', 'far', 'Rockwell', '8217', 'outrageous', 'actions', 'ideas', 'never', 'guilty', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'character', 'limits', 'control', 'just', 'enough', 'be', 'amazing', 'Rockwell', 'steals', 'scene', 'proves', 'yet', 'again', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'handle', 'script', 'given', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'also', 'impressive', 'performance', 'recent', 'years', 'Walken', 'had', 'essentially', 'become', 'parody', 'showed', 'up', 'lot', 'really', 'terrible', 'movies', 'just', 'so', 'idiot', 'teenagers', 'would', 'laugh', 'distinct', 'speech', 'pattern', 'Walken', 'anything', 'joke', 'Psychopaths', 'also', 'norm', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'calculated', 'man', 'who', 'things', 'actions', 'what', 'Walken', 'most', 'shudder-ingly', 'impressive', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'always', 'fan', 'favorite', 'most', 'performances', 'being', 'very', 'middle', 'road', 'never', 'disappoints', 'never', 'audience', 'away', 'Harrelson', '8217', 's', 'role', 'psychopaths', 'good', 'one', 'definitely', 'plays', 'Harrelson', '8217', 'strengths.The', 'script', 'lot', 'credit', 'characters', 'movie', 'clear', 'weren', '8217', 'created', 'actors', 'actors', 'certainly', 'brought', 'life', 'lesser', 'cast', 'crew', 'script', 'obviously', 'very', 'strong', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pushed', 'realm', 'far', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'fell', 'flat', '8217', 's', 'face', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'brutal', 'violence', 'perfect', 'blend', 'comedy', 'are', 'proof', 'how', 'strong', 'screen', 'play', 'really', 'was.Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'rare', 'combination', 'fairly', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'outright', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'jokes', 'are', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'snaps', 'actors', 'are', 'flawless', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'took', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'script', 'molded', 'absolute', 'master', 'piece']",Seven Psychopaths
1536537,A22Z554ZQ8NFPC,B007REV4LQ,"AF ""Whigs""","[0, 0]","I'm not going to go into detail re: the plot because others have already done so.  Basically Collin Farrell somewhat of a drunk working on a screenplay and eventually his crazy friend (Sam Rockwell) starts to help and then Christopher Walken gets involved.  Along the way Woody Harrelson plays a bad guy out to get his dog back.  Mayhem ensues.This film is funny in places, brutal in places and always interesting.  It's structured in a ""meta"" way at times, in that the screenplay becomes this movie, and they may talk through a scene and change it, and it will happen.Overall it's not perfect - it's a little slow here and there and not everything makes sense - but the performances are just great.  Christopher Walken is always great, Collin Farrell is good (I generally like him but he's a bit overshadowed by the other performances here), Sam Rockwell is his usual quirky, excellent self (really, a truly underrated actor) and Woody Harrelson takes a criminal madman and makes him somewhat sympathetic.This movie owes some style to Tarrantino, but still it's very enjoyable.

I thought it was a clever mix of action, thrills, comedy and emotional connection, and it provided Colin Farrell with his finest performance (and character) to date.  `Seven Psychopaths' was Martin McDonagh's follow up to `In Bruges', and with a reteaming with Farrell I must say that I was very interested (and hopeful) to see how this one panned out.While not as well rounded as `In Bruges', `Seven Psychopaths' sports a rich ensemble cast and some fun dialog that keeps the scenes moving, even when the plot begins to ware thing.  The opening scene is brilliantly written and sets a tone for the film that made me anxious to see more.  Sadly, I found the floundering finale to be a bit of a letdown, and the overall development of the dual storylines (the actual psychos and the fictional tale regarding them) was somewhat gargled in the process.That said, this is thoroughly entertaining!The ensemble is pretty great, with Woody Harrelson taking the cake for me.  His brooding mix of theatrical emotions and commanding intensity made for an irresistible character.  The world loves Sam Rockwell far more than I do, and I've seen him play this character before, but he was funny and effective to say the least.  Walkin was Walkin, but the more tender moments felt really authentic.  Farrell is more of an observer here.  He's the least eccentric in the cast and so his character comes off slightly boring.  That isn't to say that he's bad here, he's just not the center of attention.Funny, sharp and exciting, `Seven Psychopaths' may be as cluttered as the title suggests (and not as clear and concise as it should have been) but McDonagh has a knack for dialog and he makes the best of it here.",4,I tad messy...,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,1730,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Bruges', 'thought', 'was', 'clever', 'mix', 'action', 'thrills', 'comedy', 'emotional', 'connection', 'provided', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'finest', 'performance', 'character', 'date', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'was', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'follow', 'up', 'Bruges', 'reteaming', 'Farrell', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'hopeful', 'see', 'how', 'one', 'panned', 'out.While', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'rounded', 'Bruges', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'sports', 'rich', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'fun', 'dialog', 'scenes', 'moving', 'even', 'when', 'plot', 'ware', 'thing', 'opening', 'scene', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'tone', 'film', 'made', 'anxious', 'see', 'more', 'Sadly', 'found', 'floundering', 'finale', 'be', 'bit', 'letdown', 'overall', 'development', 'dual', 'storylines', 'actual', 'psychos', 'fictional', 'tale', 'regarding', 'was', 'somewhat', 'gargled', 'process.That', 'said', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'ensemble', 'pretty', 'great', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'taking', 'cake', 'brooding', 'mix', 'theatrical', 'emotions', 'commanding', 'intensity', 'made', 'irresistible', 'character', 'world', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'far', 'more', 'do', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'character', 'was', 'funny', 'effective', 'say', 'least', 'Walkin', 'was', 'Walkin', 'more', 'tender', 'moments', 'felt', 'really', 'authentic', 'Farrell', 'more', 'observer', 'here', 'least', 'eccentric', 'cast', 'so', 'character', 'off', 'slightly', 'boring', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'here', 'just', 'not', 'center', 'attention.Funny', 'sharp', 'exciting', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'cluttered', 'title', 'not', 'clear', 'concise', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'McDonagh', 'knack', 'dialog', 'best', 'here']",Seven Psychopaths

He is a playwright by trade, and Seven Psychopaths is like watching a Broadway theatrical production on the big screen. The movie is very deja-vuish likeU Turn, but is intelligent enough through its multi-layered storyline to topInception.In most cases, when a director makes a movie about ""making a movie"" or an author writes about a ""writer,"" it comes off as cliche and effective as beating a dead horse. I'm thinking latter day Steven King, especially the Z-grade movie adaptations that get churned out every other year. These types of movies/books/stories, etc. are stale before they hit the audience because the person at the helm is starving for original material and has nothing but their narrow-minded pursuit to draw upon. Seven Psychopaths rips on the entire movie industry, the acting profession, and the very core of celluloid as an art form while keeping its over-the-top action vehicle from derailing. The chemistry between a trio of Hollywood degenerates portrays irrational characters in a way that would not occur outside of a movie script (thinkPulp Fiction), yet is dumb-downed enough for mass consumption.Collin Farrel and Sam Rockwell share leads, while Christopher Walken and Woody Harrelson play a good supporting cast. A shih-tzu is both central conflict and comedic sidekick. There is some excellent scenery chewing going on in this movie, and Christopher Walken delivers his finest performance in years at the end of the film. Yes, it can be mean-spirited at times, and I wouldn't consider Seven Psychopaths much of a comedy, but satire and a kickass movie experience it will deliver.",5,Oscar Caliber Filmmaking,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,1766,"['Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'struck', 'rich', 'crime', 'caper', 'formula', 'witty', 'exciting', 'so', 'unpretentious', 'playwright', 'trade', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'watching', 'Broadway', 'theatrical', 'production', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'very', 'deja-vuish', 'likeU', 'Turn', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'multi-layered', 'storyline', 'topInception.In', 'most', 'cases', 'when', 'director', 'movie', 'making', 'movie', 'author', 'writer', 'off', 'cliche', 'effective', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'latter', 'day', 'Steven', 'King', 'especially', 'Z-grade', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'get', 'churned', 'out', 'other', 'year', 'types', 'movies/books/stories', 'etc', 'are', 'stale', 'hit', 'audience', 'person', 'helm', 'starving', 'original', 'material', 'nothing', 'narrow-minded', 'pursuit', 'draw', 'upon', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'entire', 'movie', 'industry', 'acting', 'profession', 'very', 'core', 'celluloid', 'art', 'form', 'keeping', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'vehicle', 'derailing', 'chemistry', 'trio', 'Hollywood', 'degenerates', 'portrays', 'irrational', 'characters', 'way', 'would', 'not', 'occur', 'movie', 'script', 'thinkPulp', 'Fiction', 'yet', 'dumb-downed', 'enough', 'mass', 'consumption.Collin', 'Farrel', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'share', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'play', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'shih-tzu', 'central', 'conflict', 'comedic', 'sidekick', 'excellent', 'scenery', 'chewing', 'going', 'movie', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'finest', 'performance', 'years', 'end', 'film', 'Yes', 'can', 'be', 'mean-spirited', 'times', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'much', 'comedy', 'satire', 'kickass', 'movie', 'experience', 'will', 'deliver']",Seven Psychopaths

1536580,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B007REV4LQ,C. Sawin,"[52, 66]","Being a big fan of ""In Bruges,"" getting excited for writer, director, and now producer Martin McDonagh's latest film ""Seven Psychopaths"" was like second nature. ""In Bruges"" is begging for a revisit, but it added a lot of humor to hitmen and crime situations that usually try to be gritty or as serious as humanly possible in films before it. ""In Bruges"" had this uniqueness to it and ""Seven Psychopaths"" is even more creative and hilarious in comparison.A struggling screenwriter named Marty (Colin Farrell) has an idea for his next screenplay; a movie entitled ""Seven Psychopaths."" The problem is Marty is having difficulty coming up with the actual story or the psychopaths for that matter and his alcoholism often gets the better of him. His strange best friend Billy (Sam Rockwell), who kidnaps dogs with a religious man named Hans (Christopher Walken) and returns them to get the reward, has extreme interest in helping Marty write his story. What Marty doesn't count on is Billy putting an ad in the newspaper that opens the door for all sorts of crazy individuals to contact him and know where he lives. Marty's thrown into a world he's never dreamt of because of it.If you've seen the poster for this, it portrays Olga Kurylenko and Abbie Cornish as two of the seven psychopaths. Ignore this. They maybe have eight minutes of screen time between the two of them and other than being the girlfriends of a few of the main characters are mostly completely irrelevant to everything else going on. The opening of the film is extraordinary; mostly because the appearance of ""Boardwalk Empire"" alumni Michael Stuhlbarg and Michael Pitt was completely unexpected. Their ""shot through the eyeball"" conversation immediately sets the messy and eccentric tone of the film.The original aspect of ""Seven Psychopaths"" resides in its writing. Marty is writing a movie called ""Seven Psychopaths"" during a film you're watching with the same name. The entire sequence where Marty, Billy, and Hans go out into the middle of nowhere to write the movie is incredible. Not only is it massively entertaining, but it gives you a number of different scenarios of how the film could play out and how Marty will decide to end his version of the movie. It's as if it shatters the fourth wall and then just keeps running for several miles.There's also this hilarious sense of logic throughout the entire comedy. Sam Rockwell is the funniest he's ever been. He acts a bit off, but everything that comes out of his mouth is just hysterical. His version of how Marty's movie should end is his shining moment, but he steals the show whenever he's on screen or opens his mouth. Nearly every conversation is just absurd though, but it's so absurd that it makes way too much sense. The phrase, ""That's just crazy enough to work!"" was meant for this film.The rest of the cast isn't wasted either. It's interesting that Mickey Rourke was originally supposed to portray Charlie since Woody Harrelson fits the role so well. His obsession with his dog makes the Charlie character completely unpredictable. Christopher Walken is really superb. He makes Hans seem so much more interesting than he really is and his rambling is often the voice of reason or so dry that it's laugh out loud funny. Tom Waits as Zachariah is captivating because of his backstory and fascination with bunnies. His motives along with his after credit sequence are just written so unusually that it's amusing.There really isn't anything else out there like ""Seven Psychopaths."" If that Marvel movie about ""Deadpool"" ever gets off the ground, you can imagine it to be a lot like this; people getting killed left and right, blood everywhere, ridiculously hilarious conversations in between and during, and the entire experience leaving a smile on your face. There's also quite a bit buried beneath the laughs and the killing; the question of whether the afterlife is real and peace being more important than war. This comedy has a very sentimental center that catches you a bit off-guard, especially when it comes to the emotional ending. ""Seven Psychopaths"" is an automatic contender for the funniest and most original comedy of the year.",5,"Original, hilarious, and a must-see",1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,4177,"['Being', 'big', 'fan', 'Bruges', 'getting', 'excited', 'writer', 'director', 'now', 'producer', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'latest', 'film', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'was', 'second', 'nature', 'Bruges', 'begging', 'revisit', 'added', 'lot', 'humor', 'hitmen', 'crime', 'situations', 'usually', 'try', 'be', 'gritty', 'as', 'serious', 'humanly', 'possible', 'films', 'Bruges', 'had', 'uniqueness', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'even', 'more', 'creative', 'hilarious', 'comparison.A', 'struggling', 'screenwriter', 'named', 'Marty', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'idea', 'next', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'entitled', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'problem', 'Marty', 'having', 'difficulty', 'coming', 'up', 'actual', 'story', 'psychopaths', 'matter', 'alcoholism', 'often', 'better', 'strange', 'best', 'friend', 'Billy', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'who', 'dogs', 'religious', 'man', 'named', 'Hans', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'get', 'reward', 'extreme', 'interest', 'helping', 'Marty', 'write', 'story', 'What', 'Marty', ""n't"", 'count', 'Billy', 'putting', 'ad', 'newspaper', 'door', 'sorts', 'crazy', 'individuals', 'contact', 'know', 'where', 'Marty', 'thrown', 'world', 'never', 'dreamt', 'it.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'poster', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'two', 'seven', 'psychopaths', 'maybe', 'have', 'eight', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'two', 'other', 'being', 'girlfriends', 'few', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'everything', 'else', 'going', 'opening', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'mostly', 'appearance', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'alumni', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'was', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'shot', 'eyeball', 'conversation', 'immediately', 'messy', 'eccentric', 'tone', 'film.The', 'original', 'aspect', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'writing', 'Marty', 'writing', 'movie', 'called', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'film', ""'re"", 'watching', 'same', 'name', 'entire', 'sequence', 'where', 'Marty', 'Billy', 'Hans', 'go', 'out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'write', 'movie', 'incredible', 'Not', 'only', 'massively', 'entertaining', 'number', 'different', 'scenarios', 'how', 'film', 'could', 'play', 'out', 'how', 'Marty', 'will', 'decide', 'end', 'version', 'movie', 'fourth', 'wall', 'then', 'just', 'keeps', 'running', 'several', 'also', 'hilarious', 'sense', 'logic', 'entire', 'comedy', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'funniest', 'ever', 'been', 'bit', 'off', 'everything', 'mouth', 'just', 'hysterical', 'version', 'how', 'Marty', 'movie', 'should', 'end', 'shining', 'moment', 'show', 'whenever', 'screen', 'mouth', 'Nearly', 'conversation', 'just', 'absurd', 'so', 'absurd', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'sense', 'phrase', 'just', 'crazy', 'enough', 'work', 'was', 'meant', 'film.The', 'rest', 'cast', ""n't"", 'wasted', 'either', 'interesting', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'portray', 'Charlie', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'obsession', 'dog', 'Charlie', 'character', 'completely', 'unpredictable', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'really', 'superb', 'Hans', 'seem', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'really', 'rambling', 'often', 'voice', 'reason', 'so', 'dry', 'laugh', 'loud', 'funny', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'Zachariah', 'captivating', 'backstory', 'fascination', 'bunnies', 'motives', 'credit', 'sequence', 'are', 'just', 'written', 'so', 'unusually', 'amusing.There', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'else', 'there', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'Deadpool', 'ever', 'ground', 'can', 'imagine', 'be', 'lot', 'people', 'getting', 'killed', 'left', 'right', 'blood', 'everywhere', 'ridiculously', 'hilarious', 'conversations', 'entire', 'experience', 'leaving', 'smile', 'face', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'buried', 'laughs', 'killing', 'question', 'afterlife', 'real', 'peace', 'being', 'more', 'important', 'war', 'comedy', 'very', 'sentimental', 'center', 'bit', 'off-guard', 'especially', 'when', 'emotional', 'ending', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'automatic', 'contender', 'funniest', 'most', 'original', 'comedy', 'year']",Seven Psychopaths

1536584,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B007REV4LQ,DanD,"[0, 1]","Part Hollywood insider piece, part action parody, SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS comes out of the gate charging full-throttle.  Well, actually the opening scene features two hitmen talking about shooting people in the eyes.  We then seque into the story of three friends: struggling screenwriter Marty (Colin Ferrell); con artist loser Billy (Sam Rockwell); and spiritual, devoted husband Hans (Christopher Walken).  When the latter two kidnap the beloved dog of a mafia leader (Woody Harrelson), all three forced to run, heading toward that inevitable climactic shootout.Martin McDonagh's previous effort, IN BRUGES, will probably go down as a classic.  SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS just might as well.  It's got a little more edge than BRUGES (more blood, too); parts of the film almost feel Tarantino-ish.  And yet, the film is wholly McDonagh's; never once does it feel like he's ripping anybody off.  In fact, his humor and parody are both spot-on, so much so that they come off as unique, even though they really aren't.It doesn't hurt that he's assembled a great cast.  Farrell returns from BRUGES, doing his slacker charm thing (this is a solid performance, but far from his best).  Rockwell steals the show as Billy; he's comedic yet unstable, an unpredictable tour-de-force that helps cement the film together.  Walken brings a surprising depth to his performance, while Harrelson oozes menace while being absolutely hilarious.  The film also features fantastic smaller performances from a range of contributors: Harry Dean Stanton, Linda Bright Clay, Michael Pitt, Michael Stuhlbarg, Gabourey Sidebe, and especially Tom Waits as a rabbit-cradling lunatic.

It was different and heralded a unique new sensibility on the cinematic scene.  ""Seven Psychopaths"" is no less audacious but may teeter a little by the weight of it's quirkiness.  The conceit here is Irish screenwriter, Marty(Colin Farell) is blocked in delivering a script to his employers.  He has a title, ""Seven Psychopaths"", and a concept of a Buddhist psychopath but nothing has been transferred from pen to paper.  Ironically a couple associates of his Billy (Sam Rockwell) and Hans(Christopher Walken) have kidnapped the beloved Shih Tzu of a psychotic thug, Charlie (Woody Harrelson).  Marty finds himself waist deep in psychopaths while he bounces ideas about the subject with Billy and Hans.  The film has an interesting structure but sometimes you think McDonagh may be biting off more than he can chew.  You know you're not in Kansas anymore when Christopher Walken is the most normal guy in the room.  That said the film leaves an impression on you that it may gain momentum on repeat viewings.

It has a great cast, and they all play their roles well. No spoilers here, but I will say that the plot is fairly creative, although a bit clumsily executed and, maybe it's me, but there were certain parts I figured out in the first ten minutes. Still, it was nice to see how they combined all of these diverse talents into a watchable film. I won't go through the cast here, or what they did, specifically, because part of the fun I derived from this movie was how the cast was introduced, and how they fit into their roles. Suffice it to say that it's one of those rare movies of recent vintage that didn't make me question whether it was worth the rental price. Candidly, I'm not sure I'd pay to own it, but as a one-time rental on Amazon Direct (or if you can get it for $5), it's worth it. Fair warning: my wife did fall asleep within the first 15 minutes despite a fair amount of action and blood-shed.

1536596,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B007REV4LQ,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","From British filmmaker Martin McDonagh (""In Bruges"", ""Six Shooter"") comes the black comedy film ""Seven Psychopaths"".  Premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival in Sept. 2012 and released in theaters the following month, ""Seven Psychopaths"" will now be released on DVD in Jan. 2013.The film begins with a writer named Marty Faranan (portrayed by Colin Farrell), who is working on a screenplay titled ""Seven Psychopaths"", about seven psychopaths but for now, all he can think of is one.  A Vietnamese victim who wants revenge on the US military that killed his family during the Vietnam War.  And wanting to create an action-film, he's have a difficulty coming up with ideas.Meanwhile, his friends include Billy Bickle (portrayed by Sam Rockwell), an unemployed actor and a crazy guy who steals dogs for a living in order to get owners cash rewards for the dog's safe return.  Billy tries to help Marty by trying to get him to use real serial killers as inspiration for the psychopaths such as the ""Jack of Diamonds"" killer (who is known for leaving the Jack of Diamonds with those he kills) and even ""Quaker"", who stalks his daughters killer for decades.  Billy goes as far as to place an advertisement in a newspaper inviting psychopaths to share their stories with Marty.Marty also hangs out with a religious man named Hans Kieslowski (portrayed by Christopher Walken) who is trying to take care of his wife Myra (portrayed by Linda Bright), who is hospitalized for cancer.One day, Billy and Hans steal a Shih Tzu named Bonny, unaware that it belongs to Charlie Costello (portrayed by Woody Harrelson), a violent gangster.  When one of Charlie's men named Paulo (portrayed by Zelijko Ivanek) finds out that Hans is connected to the kidnapping, they go to Billy's home where they threaten to kill Marty and Hans unless they reveal Bonny's location.  But the Jack of Diamonds killer arrives and kills Charlie's thugs.Meanwhile, a murderer named Zachariah Rigby (portrayed by Tom Waits), responds to the ad in the newspaper.  And he tells Marty a story about how he rescued a girl named Maggie from a killer's basement long ago.  And the two became a couple and would become serial killers of actual killers.  Traveling around America and murdering killers.  But when he found Maggie to be to cruel in her methods of killing, the two split.  And Zachariah wants Marty to leave a message for Maggie at the end of the film if he plans to use his story in his screenplay.  And Marty swears on his life that he will.As Hans is planning to visit his wife in the hospital, Charlie gets there before he does.  Very emotional about his dog being stolen and worried that his Bonny will be killed, he sends a message to Hans and his friends by killing Myra.These events then lead to Billy killing Charlie's ex-girlfriend Angela (portrayed by Olga Kurylenko) and leading Marty, Billy and Hans to go on the run with Bonny.  And as Marty spends time with Billy and Hans in the middle of nowhere, he quickly learns that his two friends have a secret they have been hiding.  And as for Billy, he has invited Charlie and his men to come get his dog at their location, in hopes for a major shootout.VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Seven Psychopaths"" is presented in 2:40:1 anamorphic widescreen and English 5.1 Dolby Digital.  It's important to note that if you want the best picture quality possible for ""Seven Psychopaths"", you will want to purchase a Blu-ray review copy of the film.As for the DVD, picture quality is as good as it gets on DVD.  Picture quality features very good detail and warm colors.  Closeups are very good and considering the film is shot outdoors, the DVD looks very good but obviously, I'm quite sure the Blu-ray version looks magnificent.As for audio, the film is pretty much a dialogue driven film, so mostly the audio is center and front-channel driven.  There are some action scenes involving gunfire towards the end but for the most part, dialogue and music are clear.Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Seven Psychopaths"" comes with the following special features:Martin McDonagh's Seven Psychopaths - (2:31) Director Martin McDonagh talks about the film and its cast.Colin Farrell is Marty - (1:25) A short featurette about Colin Farell as Marty.Woody Harrelson is Charlie - (1:24) A short featurette about Woody Harrelson playing Charlie.Crazy Locations  - (2:09) A short featurette about where the film was shot.Layers - (1:05) A short featurette with video clips going along with Billy's beat boxing.EXTRAS:""Seven Psychopaths"" comes with an Ultraviolet code which allows one to download the film to their computer and select Apple and Android devices and the ability to stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.JUDGMENT CALL:So far, leave it to Martin McDonagh to create unique films that are nothing like typical, banal Hollywood films.The director who wowed audiences and film critics with ""In Bruges"" is back with a film that is a black comedy featuring amoral characters that literally builds into this standoff of who can be the better psychopath.With two storylines within the film, one that involves a screenplay about ""Seven Psycopaths"" and the lead character trying to find inspiration for his film by talking to actual serial killers, the violent storylines that he tries to think up for his screenplay is quite fascinating, very violent but also humorous.But it's the battle between Marty's friends vs. Charlie and his thugs that make the film worth watching.  While Marty is the most reserved, Hans is quiet, it's Billy that is the mysterious unknown character because at first, you think he's just a con-man, but the more the film continues, you realize that he is quite a psychopath.  And the fact that he has found his matchup, another psychopath, the notorious gangster known as Charlie is quite interesting.Woody Harrelson plays a sensitive and crazy gangster who cares about his dog but will not hesitate to kill innocent people.  You need someone crazy to go against crazy and on Marty's side, you have the actor Sam Rockwell, always known for playing versatile roles, who matches up with Woody Harrelson's craziness with efficacy.  Especially as these two, will primarily the character of Billy, who seems he must outdo the craziness of Charlie.As for Hans, his character is rather complex.  A quiet religious man, his nature tends to change after the murder of his wife Myra.  And you eventually learn more about him and also Billy, as the film continues.As for the DVD release, first, I must say that this is a beautiful film and if you have a Blu-ray player, it's definitely worth checking out on Blu-ray.  But on DVD, the film does look and sound good, while I felt the special features was quite short at around under three minutes each.  So, I wish there were lengthier special features, maybe even an audio commentary.Overall, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is unlike any film I have ever seen.  A dark comedy which the character Hans would even say ""has many layers"", but its the way the film was written and how the characters are presented, it definitely made this film much more satisfying.  An original and unique film with a lot of twists along the way, Martin McDonagh's ""Seven Psychopaths"" is recommended!",4,"An original and unique film with a lot of twists along the way, Martin

1536598,A2W73MEH3JN4NY,B007REV4LQ,"D. Leach ""hardcase99""","[17, 52]","You see the cast.  You know Walken is in there.  How bad could it be?  VERY bad.  To the point that you feel the people who made the movie have revealed more about themselves and how vile their thought process is than they intended.  Bad in a way that makes you sorry you gave up the time to see it.  And I am certainly capable of enjoying a bad movie.  This movie is not like that.It's entertaining, even promising, for about 20 minutes.  From that point you are simply not watching a comedy, period.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  It is trying to be clever so hard it has back-sweats.  And there's lots of bad effort to steal from other movies that I'm sure the filmmakers thought this movie was going to resemble.  You can almost hear them in the pitch meeting saying that it's going to be just like FILL-IN-THE-BLANK.  There is an attempt at ""Snatch"".  Nope.  It uses self-reference, ""Adaptation"" style, to no effect whatsoever.  They're ripping off everyone from Tarantino to Coppola, all for naught.  The only interesting element is that the film confesses that it's going to disappoint you even as you're watching it degenerate.  ""Dark"" comedies still have to be funny.  At least a little.  If you watch this, when it ends you will sigh.  And hang your head a little.  And you'll think to yourself, ""Well, there's a hundred minutes of my life I will never see again...""The story uses (mis-uses) some real world historical events in a manner than can only be described as shameful.  Really.  Seeing them utilized the way they are here only succeeds in making you want to take a shower. Additionally it demonstrates that the writer - who is Irish - does not have the faintest understanding of what these events mean to Americans.  And I want to be clear, none of these flaws are in and of themselves amusing.  You will not get a kick out of seeing the mistakes in tone and pace the way you can with some movies.  The effect here is more akin to seeing a bird with a broken wing; you wish all these actors had labored in a different project, and you especially come away with a stomach ache that Walken used some of his days being dragged through the mud on this project.  So to answer that question - NO it's not worth it because it's Walken.  You just feel bad for him, as he spits up the tripe composed by this bleary eyed and baffled writer and director.  To those comparing this in ANY way to a Coen Brothers film, SHAME on you.  I will promise you this, if you approach this trash expecting anything within a thousand miles of a Coen Brothers film you won't just be disappointed - you'll be angry.So often the experience is one where you almost say out loud, ""No, I am not going to go there with you, you don't know what you're doing"".  Violence is expressed here in a manner that inadvertently tells you that this is what the people who made the film think of you.  That THIS is what they think YOU (Americans) enjoy.  How insulting.  Not just violence, but cruelty, displayed in a pointless callous way.  Women are especially disposable here, and again the film admits that.

It's a ""noir humor"" film in the same tradition asFargo,Natural Born Killers, andMeeting Evil, and takes the subgenre one step further by spoofing these other spoofs. Several interesting premise-characters here, including a psychopathic killer who only kills other psychopathic killers and a hack screenwriter (expertly played by Colin Farrell) whose constipated work-in-progress oddly coincides with his friends' and adversaries' own predicament. Oh, and let's not forget the ruthless cutthroat gangster whose beloved Shih Tzu's been kidnapped by the screenwriter's associates. Yep, many interesting characters and details of conflict: The deranged Vietnamese priest also deserves mention. The thematic dialogue carries a good bit of this film and, especially toward the end, is very original and quite amusing, though not in a truly ""lol"" sense of the word.Copious amounts of schlocky blood and gore throughout. Also, while there's nothing inherentirely misogynistic about the film itself, the harsh, constant ""male-talk"" about women-in-general is not likely to resonate with many female audiences.Yet, for all its colorful ideas and details, as well as some very effective satire of modern society, SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS does not quite have the creative punch of other films of its type, including any of the three excellent works mentioned.

That's actually a central point of the plot, which revolves around Colin Farrell's tail-chasing efforts to compose the film's screenplay whilst in the midst of it. We dance around this issue for a bit in the first hour, but once embraced it leads to a number of sharp, bitterly funny conversations and revelations that really help the film stand out as something different. Its jaded, desensitized approach to gruesome violence can be unsettling, but something tells me that's kind of the point. For that matter, so are the simple, shallow characters that pepper the perimeter and the story's rambling, uncertain climax. Farrell is constantly bookended by his cohorts, Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken, who portray two glaringly colorful characters but don't really bring a lot of depth or flavor to the mix. They're each painted with a single stroke, which could again be construed as part of the film's message... but at some point it's natural to question how many times it can fall back on that ready-made excuse.

He pulls this off with a smart script and with a cast of actors that simply could not be improved upon. Once it starts it doesn't stop  - not even at the end of the film when the absurdities just keep flying.Chronically drunk Irish screenwriter Martin (Colin Farrell) has serious writer's block to the point that his drunken diatribes result in the loss of his girl Kaya (Abbie Cornish) and draws him closer to his best friend and wannabe writer Billy (Sam Rockwell - never better and in fact the true star of this film!). Martin is struggling to write a screenplay called `Seven Psychopaths' and Billy helps him find the characters to reference: crazy old bunny carrying Zachariah (Tom Waits) who shares his youthful killing spree with his wife (Amanda Warren), Cop Charlie (Woody Harrelson) and his sidekick Paulo (Zeljko Ivanek) out looking for Charlie's kidnapped Shih Tzu blamed on an innocent Sharice (Gabourey Sidibe), but actually dognapped by Hans (Christopher Waken) to support his hospitalized wife (Linda Bright Clay - in a terrific cameo), a strange old man (Harry Dean Stanton) who slices his own throat, a loony Vietnamese priest (Long Nguyen) and other equally psychopathic characters. There is bona fide madness within and without every character and the manner in which McDonagh makes it all play out is a feat of cinematic genius.

I didn't know what to expect except from the synopsis. All I knew it that it had a great cast: Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, Colin Farrell, Christopher Walken etc. That was enough for me to RVSP for the movie. Then I learned it was from upcoming director Martin McDonagh whose gotten critically acclaim for his work. Then I knew I was in for quite an evening.I gotta say it delivered the goods. Dark comedies are definitely a great genre especially if handled well. McDonagh utilizes his talent very well. I and the screening audience definitely laughed at every turn.All the performances were very good. I am not a big Colin Farrel fan, but he was perfect as ""Marty""-the screenwriter who doesn't know what he's gotten himself into when he puts an ad to interview psychopaths for his screenplay ""Seven Psychopaths"" at the request of his friend Billy (Sam Rockwell). Sam Rockwell was great as Billy. Woody Harrelson as the mafia boss. Christopher Walken was great as Hans.One thing that always sticks out for me when I enjoy a movie is noticing how well the cast enjoys themselves in playing their roles.

1536633,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B007REV4LQ,I'm Right,"[2, 4]","Seven Psychopaths is from the same director who made the great 2008 film In Bruges. Unlike most Tarantino-rip off movies In Bruges actually had some depth to the usual hitman comedy schtick as well as well done dark humor and a nice plot that ties everything together. Seven Psychopaths on the other hand seems like the director threw darts at a chart with random things and scrambled to put it together. ""Ok I hit bunnies, gotta throw bunnies in there, ok I hit peyote, gotta throw that in there now"", and it all comes out rather bland.The main problem I had with Seven Psychopaths was that it was predictable. You'd think with a name like Seven Psychopaths it'd be a free-for-all, but instead you can tell who the main character is, who's going to die, who you should feel sorry for, yadda yadda. Another thing is besides Sam Rockwell (who puts in another great performance), none of them seem all that crazy. Colin Ferrel is basically the same self-loathing drunk from In Bruges, Christopher Walken is just his usual hammy self with a 'dark past'. Woody Harrelson is basically an A-hole, and he was really underplayed in this. An ambiguously gay guy who loves his little Shih Tzu more than life itself, what does he do for a living? Why is he so obsessed with that dog? You never really know, you just know he's emotionally unstable. I know there could've been some good jokes from his past, but alas, another missed opportunity. The other three psychopaths are barely in the movie, you have LOLSORANDOM psycho with his pet bunny, and the two women who aren't seen after the first half hour.Some things worked, some things didn't. I liked the set up of a few losers in LA stealing dogs then returning them for the ransom, clever idea. I liked how Colin Ferrel was trying to write a movie based off this movie, there were some good jokes in it, even though the meta-commentary is starting to get old in movies. But then you get stuff like when they took peyote, and it added literally nothing into the film.Now I was a few whiskey's deep when I watched this, so it's more than likely that I missed some things, but in general the movie feels half-baked, like all the ingredients are there, but they're not used well. It was enjoyable enough to watch but overall a sophomore slump for director Martin McDonagh.

1536637,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B007REV4LQ,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[24, 32]","Back a few years ago, a writer/director by the name of Martin McDonagh emerged very heavily on the cinematic stage with the extremely black comedy IN BRUGES. It was hilariously funny, shockingly violent, utterly absurd at points as well as surprisingly human and touching. It also gave Colin Farrell possibly his best role ever. And with such an excellent film between them, what could they possibly do that could live up to the expectations set by that film?They could reteam and make SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS, and it really does live up to the expectations.SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS primarily follows Martin (Farrell), a screenwriter in Hollywood trying desperately to write his newest script which he calls ""Seven Psychopaths"". His best friend is Billy (Sam Rockwell), a struggling actor who runs a dog-kidnapping... excuse me, dog-borrowing business on the side with his partner Hans (Christopher Walken) in which they find wealthy dog-owners, take the dogs, and return them for the reward money. Unfortunately for all involved, they end up taking the wrong person's dog, and that person is Mr. Costello (Woody Harrelson), a crime boss who loves his little Shih Tzu above all other things. A brutal and deadly pursuit begins for Costello as he tries to retrieve his dog, while Martin becomes embroiled in this mad scheme. All the while, Martin is coming up with ideas for more psychopaths to use in his film, and also meeting them via an ad that Billy put in the paper specifically for psychopaths to tell their story to Martin, and one of those is the bunny-petting Zachariah (Tom Waits), who has quite the tale to tell. Lines between life and art start to gradually blur as the inevitable confrontation between the dog-nappers and the dog-napped comes ever closer.Like IN BRUGES, SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS treads the very thin line between tragedy and comedy with some absolutely devastating moments, but then somehow finds a way to make itself the funniest film I've seen this year with some absolutely masterful performances that will likely be forgotten when Awards Season kicks off. Sam Rockwell continues his streak of scene-stealing performances as Billy, who is rightly considered one of the seven psychopaths of the title. Colin Farrell is forced to play straight man to the likes of Rockwell and Walken and does a nicely nuanced job of it. Harrelson is menacing and violently unpredictable enough to be a good villain, but also his obsessive love of his dog makes his bad guy increasingly absurd and funny. Waits does a really nice job with what must be a fun role to play and a really interesting character to watch. Also appearing in the film are Abbie Cornish as Martin's on-off girlfriend, Linda Bright Clay as Hans' wife and Olga Kurlyenko as Billy's secret girlfriend. This is really the only problem that I had with the film is that the female characters are largely ignored or marginalized, but there may be method to McDonagh's madness as there is a conversation in the film about Martin's screenplay lacking anything beyond one-dimensional female characters (which likely speaks to the metatext of the entire film). But when all is said and truly done, it's Walken who walks away with this picture. It's a performance of wit, sensitivity, genuine humanity, some menace and if nothing else, the ""put your hands up"" scene is something that will be in the annals of film comedy history.There are so many moments of high humor in this film, it's hard to enumerate them, but what's perhaps most important about this film is the discussion about the film as the film is going on between its characters. Billy sees this whole story AS a film, and Martin looks to include stories from the film in his film. The film becomes a semi-satire of itself as it goes on, much like Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon's THE CABIN IN THE WOODS. As that film provided a metatextual satire of horror film conventions, SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS offers up satire of the post-Tarantino crime genre, with philosophical hitmen, final shootouts, Mexican standoffs, etcetera. McDonagh makes all of the film's drama, comedy and action work with a wink in its eye and gallows humor in its heart.It's also important to know that if you liked IN BRUGES, then in all likelihood, you will really enjoy this film. But if you didn't care for IN BRUGES, you probably won't like this film. SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS, like IN BRUGES, does have some pretty massive tonal shifts from hilarious comedy to gut-wrenching tragedy and that can be hard to swallow for some audiences. It may not seem like it, but that is important to take into account.SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS is one of those rare great films that succeeds on all the levels it reaches for, but is strange enough to leave you wondering long after the credits roll... and believe me, STAY FOR THE CREDITS.

1536667,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B007REV4LQ,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 10]","For a film about nothing, Seven Psychopaths is one of the most delightful films of the year. Writer/director Martin McDonagh re-teams with Colin Farrell from the 2008 classic In Bruges and peppers his film with a terrific ensemble cast that includes Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken, Woody Harrelson, Tom Waits, Kevin Corrigan, and Harry Dean Stanton. The film's plot is a wonderful slice of metafiction that deliberately blurs the line between what's actually happening and what's just happening in the script the main character is writing. With that in mind, Seven Psychopaths isn't really about anything yet it has one of the most ingenious scripts of the year.The film opens with two hit men (Michael Pitt and Michael Stuhlbarg) discussing, at length, shooting a woman through the eyes. As they banter back-and-forth a masked man nonchalantly walks up behind them and shoots them both. This is Psychopath No. 1. From here we meet Marty (Farrell), an alcoholic screenwriter working on his latest script entitled `Seven Psychopaths.' The problem is he doesn't yet know who the seven psychopaths are. His friend Billy Bickle (Rockwell), an unemployed actor who, with his partner Hans (Walken), moonlights as a dog thief, attempts to provide him with unwanted assistance. When Billy kidnaps a Shih Tzu from Charlie (Harrelson), a violent gangster, Billy, Marty, and Hans find themselves running for their lives. This is intercut with Marty building his own script, with the help of some outside ideas.Somehow, even when the film jumps into Marty's own fictional narrative it remains fascinating. One sequence involves a Quaker (Stanton) getting revenge for the death of his daughter and there's an eloquent, macabre sequence narrated by Zachariah Rigby (Waits). The film is consistently entertaining and endlessly fascinating.This is McDonagh's second film, but as an acclaimed playwright he's well-versed in his craft. Seven Psychopaths is a slight departure from In Bruges tonally, but it has the same dark humor and the same mark of his genius. His screenplay is brilliantly plotted; a hilarious and violent work with memorable dialogue complemented by his eye for casting and his prowess as a director. There seems to be a Quentin Tarantino/Guy Ritchie influence here, yet he puts his unique stamp on the formula and creates a delightfully demented crime film that is destined to become a cult classic.The performances are showy and I'm not sure any will be considered Oscar-worthy, but they are very fun to watch. Walken hasn't given a performance this inspired in years. His energetic and hilarious performance teeters on the edge of self-parody at times, but it's very self-aware and possibly the funniest acting in the film. Harrelson demonstrates his enviable range here with his ability to move from one extreme to the other; in one moment, he's a frightening psychopath and in another he's hilarious...Sometimes at the same time. Tom Waits brings his own quirkiness to a role that only he would be able to create in such a way. Rockwell meanwhile nearly steals the show from everyone in a perfect Rockwell-type role. Farrell does a fine job, but he seems to allow the other actors to take center stage.I admit the film is bedazzling to a degree. So much is good about it; it's easy to forget it's not perfect. Towards the latter half of the film it becomes a little too meta for its own good and almost veers off-track, but McDonagh skillfully reels it back in before it loses traction.Seven Psychopaths isn't a masterpiece, but I predict it will become an often-seen classic among many viewers and will be enjoyed through repeat viewings in the coming years. It doesn't quite touch the brilliance of In Bruges, but it is a cartoonishly fun film that expertly blends ingenious writing, hilarity, and violence. It's one of the most original films of the year by far and certainly one of 2012's best.",5,A Film About Nothing,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,3909,"['film', 'nothing', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'one', 'most', 'delightful', 'films', 'year', 'Writer/director', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 're-teams', 'Colin', 'Farrell', '2008', 'classic', 'Bruges', 'peppers', 'film', 'terrific', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'Kevin', 'Corrigan', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'film', 'plot', 'wonderful', 'slice', 'metafiction', 'deliberately', 'line', 'what', 'actually', 'happening', 'what', 'just', 'happening', 'script', 'main', 'character', 'writing', 'mind', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'yet', 'one', 'most', 'ingenious', 'scripts', 'year.The', 'film', 'two', 'hit', 'men', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'discussing', 'length', 'shooting', 'woman', 'eyes', 'banter', 'back-and-forth', 'masked', 'man', 'nonchalantly', 'up', 'shoots', 'Psychopath', 'No', '1', 'here', 'meet', 'Marty', 'Farrell', 'alcoholic', 'screenwriter', 'working', 'latest', 'script', 'entitled', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'problem', ""n't"", 'yet', 'know', 'who', 'seven', 'psychopaths', 'are', 'friend', 'Billy', 'Bickle', 'Rockwell', 'unemployed', 'actor', 'who', 'partner', 'Hans', 'Walken', 'moonlights', 'dog', 'thief', 'attempts', 'provide', 'unwanted', 'assistance', 'When', 'Billy', 'Shih', 'Tzu', 'Charlie', 'Harrelson', 'violent', 'gangster', 'Billy', 'Marty', 'Hans', 'find', 'running', 'lives', 'intercut', 'Marty', 'building', 'own', 'script', 'help', 'outside', 'ideas.Somehow', 'even', 'when', 'film', 'Marty', 'own', 'fictional', 'narrative', 'fascinating', 'One', 'sequence', 'Quaker', 'Stanton', 'getting', 'revenge', 'death', 'daughter', 'eloquent', 'macabre', 'sequence', 'narrated', 'Zachariah', 'Rigby', 'Waits', 'film', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'endlessly', 'fascinating.This', 'McDonagh', 'second', 'film', 'acclaimed', 'playwright', 'well-versed', 'craft', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'slight', 'departure', 'Bruges', 'tonally', 'same', 'dark', 'humor', 'same', 'mark', 'genius', 'screenplay', 'brilliantly', 'plotted', 'hilarious', 'violent', 'work', 'memorable', 'dialogue', 'complemented', 'eye', 'casting', 'prowess', 'director', 'be', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino/Guy', 'Ritchie', 'influence', 'here', 'yet', 'unique', 'stamp', 'formula', 'delightfully', 'demented', 'crime', 'film', 'destined', 'become', 'cult', 'classic.The', 'performances', 'are', 'showy', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'considered', 'Oscar-worthy', 'are', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'Walken', ""n't"", 'given', 'performance', 'inspired', 'years', 'energetic', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'teeters', 'edge', 'self-parody', 'times', 'very', 'self-aware', 'possibly', 'funniest', 'acting', 'film', 'Harrelson', 'enviable', 'range', 'here', 'ability', 'move', 'one', 'extreme', 'other', 'one', 'moment', 'frightening', 'psychopath', 'hilarious', 'Sometimes', 'same', 'time', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'own', 'quirkiness', 'role', 'only', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'such', 'way', 'Rockwell', 'meanwhile', 'nearly', 'show', 'everyone', 'perfect', 'Rockwell-type', 'role', 'Farrell', 'fine', 'job', 'allow', 'other', 'actors', 'take', 'center', 'stage.I', 'admit', 'film', 'bedazzling', 'degree', 'So', 'much', 'good', 'easy', 'forget', 'not', 'perfect', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'meta', 'own', 'good', 'almost', 'veers', 'off-track', 'McDonagh', 'skillfully', 'back', 'traction.Seven', 'Psychopaths', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'predict', 'will', 'become', 'often-seen', 'classic', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'coming', 'years', ""n't"", 'quite', 'touch', 'brilliance', 'Bruges', 'cartoonishly', 'fun', 'film', 'expertly', 'ingenious', 'writing', 'hilarity', 'violence', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'films', 'year', 'far', 'certainly', 'one', '2012', 'best']",Seven Psychopaths
1536668,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B007REV4LQ,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.A struggling writer, a stolen dog, and a group of crazy people. Does that sound like an interesting film to you? If not, then get out now. If so, then read on my friend because you just might be crazy enough to enjoy the insanity that is Seven Psychopaths. Crazy, over-the-top premise aside I found myself loving this film. It's fun, it's crazy, and it doesn't take itself too seriously.You follow Marty Faranan (Colin Farrell), a struggling writer trying to finish his screenplay, ""Seven Psychopaths"". The problem is that Marty can't seem to get started and to top it off he has a bit of a drinking problem. As his friend Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell) says, ""It's in your f***ing blood, man!"" Oh, Marty's Irish. So that's what Billy meant by ""It's in your blood"". Anyway, Billy is an unemployed actor who makes a living off of kid-napping dogs with his friend Has Kieslowski (Christopher Walken).Things take a sharp turn when Billy steals a dog from a violent gangster by the name of Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson). So now these three men are trying to run for their lives so as not to get their heads blown off by Charlie. In an attempt to get away they go out to the dessert where Marty continues to work on his screenplay with Billy and Hans. Only now, he's not sure that this thrilling psychopath movie is what he wants to write anymore because he wants the ending to be grounded and humane.I never watched Martin McDonagh's previous film In Burges so I'm not sure how that compares to Seven Psychopaths, but if I had to compare this to another movie I think I would use Snatch. Now this is nowhere near the brilliance of Snatch, but Seven Psychopaths has some of the same elements. There's a lot of dark humor and the violence is so over-the-top that the would-be gruesome scenes come off as funny and comedic. Plus, the movie is filled with a lot of interesting characters.What this film does extremely well, aside from providing you with a unique, engaging story, is keep you guessing. As Marty is writing his story he's starting to use real stories based on previous and current psychopaths (In the movie's world, not reality). So as you watch the story progress you get to see all seven psychopaths in the flesh. The twist is that a few of the characters in this movie appear relatively normal, but you soon learn that sometimes the normal ones are the craziest of them all.I think that's why I enjoyed this movie as much as I did. You don't expect it to pan out the way that it does, but as you learn these secrets everything just feels right. There have been many recent movies that force these character twists and they don't feel natural, but Seven Psychopaths nails it with ease. It's one of those things that you don't see until you actually see it and then you go ""Ohhhh"".Surprisingly, Seven Psychopaths isn't all laughs and violence. Throughout the movie you'll see Marty grow as an individual and there's a few heartfelt moments with Hans and his wife Myra (Linda Bright Clay). It's these moments that really help balance out the story and keep everything grounded. Even when Billy's having a shootout or Marty's getting drunk, life never stops. Things happen that are not always under our control. It adds a touch of heart and normality to an otherwise crazy experience.Finally, the casting in this film is excellent and each of the four leads are phenomenal. Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, and Christopher Walken have fantastic chemistry on screen and it's a joy to watch them in a scene together. Then Woody Harrelson gave another one of his bad-boy-that-has-a-heart performances and nails it yet again. There's really not anyone to complain about in here because even the minor cast members like Tom Waits and Linda Bright Clay nailed their performances.Overall Score: 8.25/10 - Seven Psychopaths is a blast from start to finish and I'm glad I finally got the chance to see it. It's funny and over-the-top, but it's also charming and there's enough heart there to keep the experience grounded.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[90, 103]","Martin McDonagh, among the best known Irish directors previously won an Oscar for the short movie Six shooterA Collection of 2005 Academy Award Nominated Short Filmsalthough he is perhaps best known for the acclaimedIn Brugesalso starring Colin Farrell, a dark comedy with tragic overtones about two hitmen on the run.I first heard of this movie last year when I saw the movie The Guard directed by his brother Michael John. A trademark of the McDonaghs is dark humor mixed with some irony and perhaps even some philosophy together with some absurdity. As I loved The Guard so much and it has the biggest domestic box office of any Irish movie ever made, I looked forward to this latest movie with more than a little anticipation.If you're like me and like American directors who also write such as Tarantino with Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill, or the Coen Brothers with No Country for Old Men, I think you will also like this.Seven Psychopaths centers around an Irish screenwriter nemed Martin played by Colin Farrell planning to write a movie about seven psychopaths. Life begins to imitate art as a similar tableau to the one he writes about starts to unfold in real life.Woody Harrelson plays Sam a local organised crime leader whose dog is kidnapped by Walken and Sam Rockwell's character who happen to be friends of Martin. Sam cares more about dogs than people. The real mixes with the imaginary in very intriguing ways, and kept the movie audience entertained. I particularly liked the scenes with the Vietnamese priest and the hooker, and the Quaker story. There is also a hit man with a white rabbit played by Tom Waits.The revelatory performance in this movie comes from Sam Rockwell when he helps out Martin with the screenplay lending some psychotic absurdity to the scenes although everyone is excellent.What I like is that McDonagh while clearly inspired by Tarantino and Coen imposes his unique style and does not kowtow to Hollywood conventions and delivers a movie that experiments with different styles of humor and yet manages to engross you so much in the moment that you do not attempt to guess the end. If you do you would probably guess wrong.I love how he works the opening scene with two hitmen discussing preparing for a hit and how the scene turns out.While I would not consider this better than say In Bruges there is a certain heaviness in the theme of In Bruges that is not present here and some people may prefer the more light hearted nature of this movie which is a highly welcome and worthy addition to the McDonagh repertoire.I hope the McDonagh brothers will work together as I think they could give the Coen brothers a run for their money.I think you will love it and I hope this was helpful.",4,Living and dying for the sake of Shih Tsu,1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,2729,"['Martin', 'McDonagh', 'best', 'known', 'Irish', 'directors', 'previously', 'won', 'Oscar', 'short', 'movie', 'Six', 'Collection', '2005', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Nominated', 'Short', 'Filmsalthough', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'acclaimedIn', 'Brugesalso', 'starring', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'dark', 'comedy', 'tragic', 'overtones', 'two', 'hitmen', 'run.I', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'Guard', 'directed', 'brother', 'Michael', 'John', 'A', 'trademark', 'McDonaghs', 'dark', 'humor', 'mixed', 'irony', 'perhaps', 'even', 'philosophy', 'together', 'absurdity', 'loved', 'Guard', 'so', 'much', 'biggest', 'domestic', 'box', 'office', 'Irish', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'looked', 'forward', 'latest', 'movie', 'more', 'little', 'anticipation.If', ""'re"", 'American', 'directors', 'who', 'also', 'write', 'such', 'Tarantino', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'think', 'will', 'also', 'like', 'this.Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'centers', 'Irish', 'screenwriter', 'nemed', 'Martin', 'played', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'planning', 'write', 'movie', 'seven', 'psychopaths', 'Life', 'imitate', 'art', 'similar', 'tableau', 'one', 'starts', 'unfold', 'real', 'life.Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Sam', 'local', 'organised', 'crime', 'leader', 'dog', 'kidnapped', 'Walken', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'character', 'who', 'be', 'friends', 'Martin', 'Sam', 'more', 'dogs', 'people', 'real', 'mixes', 'imaginary', 'very', 'intriguing', 'ways', 'kept', 'movie', 'audience', 'entertained', 'particularly', 'liked', 'scenes', 'Vietnamese', 'priest', 'hooker', 'Quaker', 'story', 'also', 'hit', 'man', 'white', 'rabbit', 'played', 'Tom', 'Waits.The', 'revelatory', 'performance', 'movie', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'when', 'out', 'Martin', 'screenplay', 'lending', 'psychotic', 'absurdity', 'scenes', 'everyone', 'excellent.What', 'like', 'McDonagh', 'clearly', 'inspired', 'Tarantino', 'Coen', 'unique', 'style', 'not', 'kowtow', 'Hollywood', 'conventions', 'delivers', 'movie', 'different', 'styles', 'humor', 'yet', 'manages', 'engross', 'so', 'much', 'moment', 'do', 'not', 'attempt', 'guess', 'end', 'do', 'would', 'probably', 'guess', 'wrong.I', 'love', 'how', 'opening', 'scene', 'two', 'hitmen', 'discussing', 'preparing', 'hit', 'how', 'scene', 'would', 'not', 'consider', 'better', 'say', 'Bruges', 'certain', 'heaviness', 'theme', 'Bruges', 'not', 'present', 'here', 'people', 'may', 'prefer', 'more', 'light', 'hearted', 'nature', 'movie', 'highly', 'welcome', 'worthy', 'addition', 'McDonagh', 'repertoire.I', 'hope', 'McDonagh', 'brothers', 'will', 'work', 'together', 'think', 'could', 'give', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'run', 'money.I', 'think', 'will', 'love', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",Seven Psychopaths

Seven vignettes of various psychopaths, their lives and their deeds or misdeeds expressed on film.Not a particularly original or novel concept; which was, apparently, the point.*Marty's two best friends and would-be muses are Bill, a brash loudmouth wannabe actor who seemingly has no clue that he's an obnoxious windbag with serious anger issues. And Hans, the sweet old veteran of the team whose life revolves around caring for his cancer ridden wife. The two work as small time schlubs whose criminal endeavors are infinitely less impressive or fantastical - and unsuitable to be Marty's inspiration - pathetically going about stealing pet dogs and holding onto them for the reward money.And as the screenplay moves along, Bill desperately attempts to interject himself into the creative process. The intimation being that he's an ego whore in constant need of reflective fame. But is that really what drives his insistent attempts to contribute to the script? Still, after sharing a particularly bizarre tale about a father and his murdered daughter, Marty decides that maybe he has something to offer after all and invites him to be a co-writer, much to Bill's everlasting joy and boundless enthusiasm.An enthusiasm that will bring Marty closer than he ever wanted to his imagined seven psychopaths.Like a pungent antisocial onion, each revelation exposes the increasingly freakish connections between the outrageous fiction of the screenplay and the real-life experiences of the characters we meet throughout the film. Culminating in a hilarious, if predictable finish, as the three friends stumble into their respective destinies.If what I've read is true, then success of the film is found in spite of itself; less an accomplishment and more a pleasant surprise - likely to the filmmakers themselves.*Apparently, this was Director Martin McDonagh's attempt at satirizing the American movie mythology; a deconstruction of our ""ideal"" film and its archetypes. If that's accurate, then he failed. 'Psychopaths' doesn't properly draw out the comical to an absurd effect. Instead, while exploiting the same content, the film doesn't extract itself from the repetitive retread themes and stock characters he's attempting to skewer. His movie fell into the same trap.",3,Failed Deconstruction That Works Despite Itself,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,3078,"['Due', 'great', 'part', 'commercial', 'adverts', 'went', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'literal', 'seven', 'nutters', 'carrying', 'multitude', 'high', 'powered', 'and/or', 'bladed', 'weapons', 'mold', 'Guy', 'Ritchie-esque', 'hardcore', 'twisted', 'comedy', 'Discovering', 'plot', 'revolved', 'three', 'guys', 'dog', 'well', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'being', 'sold', 'promotionals.However', 'said', 'once', 'past', 'fallen', 'expectations', 'found', 'slowly', 'enjoying', 'quirky', 'flick', 'further', 'along', 'film', 'better', 'got', 'Very', 'much', 'experience', ""'Cloud"", ""Atlas'.The"", 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'title', 'proposed', 'movie', 'part-time', 'screenwriter', 'full-time', 'alcoholic', 'creating', 'Tired', 'same', 'ol', 'same', 'ol', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'character', 'Martin', 'vision', 'do', 'something', 'completely', 'fresh', 'original', 'Seven', 'vignettes', 'various', 'psychopaths', 'lives', 'deeds', 'misdeeds', 'expressed', 'film.Not', 'particularly', 'original', 'novel', 'concept', 'was', 'apparently', 'point', '*Marty', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'would-be', 'muses', 'are', 'Bill', 'brash', 'loudmouth', 'wannabe', 'actor', 'who', 'seemingly', 'clue', 'obnoxious', 'windbag', 'serious', 'anger', 'issues', 'Hans', 'sweet', 'old', 'veteran', 'team', 'life', 'around', 'caring', 'cancer', 'ridden', 'wife', 'two', 'work', 'small', 'time', 'schlubs', 'criminal', 'endeavors', 'are', 'infinitely', 'less', 'impressive', 'fantastical', 'unsuitable', 'be', 'Marty', 'inspiration', 'pathetically', 'going', 'stealing', 'pet', 'dogs', 'holding', 'reward', 'money.And', 'screenplay', 'along', 'Bill', 'desperately', 'interject', 'creative', 'process', 'intimation', 'being', 'ego', 'whore', 'constant', 'need', 'reflective', 'fame', 'really', 'what', 'insistent', 'attempts', 'contribute', 'script', 'Still', 'sharing', 'particularly', 'bizarre', 'tale', 'father', 'murdered', 'daughter', 'Marty', 'maybe', 'something', 'offer', 'be', 'co-writer', 'much', 'Bill', 'everlasting', 'joy', 'boundless', 'enthusiasm.An', 'enthusiasm', 'will', 'bring', 'Marty', 'closer', 'ever', 'wanted', 'imagined', 'seven', 'pungent', 'antisocial', 'onion', 'revelation', 'increasingly', 'freakish', 'connections', 'outrageous', 'fiction', 'screenplay', 'real-life', 'experiences', 'characters', 'meet', 'film', 'Culminating', 'hilarious', 'predictable', 'finish', 'three', 'friends', 'stumble', 'respective', 'destinies.If', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'true', 'then', 'success', 'film', 'found', 'spite', 'accomplishment', 'more', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'likely', 'filmmakers', '*Apparently', 'was', 'Director', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'attempt', 'satirizing', 'American', 'movie', 'mythology', 'deconstruction', 'ideal', 'film', 'archetypes', 'accurate', 'then', 'failed', ""'Psychopaths"", ""n't"", 'properly', 'draw', 'out', 'comical', 'absurd', 'effect', 'Instead', 'exploiting', 'same', 'content', 'film', ""n't"", 'extract', 'repetitive', 'retread', 'themes', 'stock', 'characters', 'attempting', 'skewer', 'movie', 'fell', 'same', 'trap']",Seven Psychopaths

1536700,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007REV4LQ,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Fiction meets reality in this seriously dark comedy. Colin Farrell plays Marty, a struggling writer whose newest screenplay is based on select events in his life. The story involves several killers (thus the title) and how their lives become entangled in one another. Marty's concept is supplied to him by his friend and some time room mate Billy (Sam Rockwell).Things are set in motion with Billy and Marty's other friend Hans (Christopher Walken), Billy's partner. These two are low level bad guys who make a living by kidnapping dogs of wealthy people and then returning them for a reward. Unfortunately the Shih Tzu that the pair of kidnapped at the moment is the beloved pet of big time mobster Charlie (Woody Harrelson) who sends out his minions to discover who would be so bold and to then kill them.But the movie offers us more than just this simple story as Billy tells tale after tale to Marty about the various killers he's brought up. One is a Vietnamese killer out to set things straight. Another is a killer who feels his daughter was wronged by a young man. One is known as the Jack of Diamonds killer because he leaves a playing card behind on each of the high level mobsters he kills. And then there is Zachariah (Tom Waites) who replies to an ad Billy placed asking for psychopaths to tell Marty their story. Apparently Zachariah and his wife were multiple serial killers as he unfolds his tale to Marty only to then let him know he'll have to kill him eventually. All of these items play into the whole story that is not only being written by Marty but that he and his friends are actually living.Along the way we also find out more about Hans and Billy. Hans' wife is in a nursing home and he visits her frequently. One of the many stories that Marty hears and writes about involves Hans and his wife. Several relate to Billy in one way or another. All have surprising consequences that you don't quite see coming as the story unfolds.That's what makes this movie so special. The pieces of the puzzle are offered to you as viewer but they eventually drop into place as more and more are told the pieces turned this way and that as to make sense. About 2/3 into the film Marty, Hans and Billy go on a road trip to the desert and overnight more tales are told and almost everything the stories have led up to happens.So many films these days love to take on the title of quirky and few ever live up to that concept. This film grasps it with both hands and clings to it tightly, deservedly so. It not only offers something truly different than most movies have to offer it does so with a unique blend of sadness, adventure and dark humor that rarely combine well but here come together like few films do.There is nothing that is sub-par about anything involved in this film. The acting is tremendous and all three main leads have their moment in the sun. Farrell downplays his character so as to not be the leading man we've grown accustomed to. Rockwell shows that his abilities are almost always underused until now. And Walken at times does a parody of what we've come to associate with him but then shows that his character is perhaps the one with the biggest heart of all.With a title like this some will shy away and be afraid of what they will encounter. Then again with the dark humor involved it might not be for everyone. But if you're willing to take a chance you'll find one of the funniest and most touching films albeit a gory film that you will find something to like in it.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[2, 4]","SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS (2012) is a wickedly delightful, somewhat violent, black comedy, written and directed by Martin McDonagh, whose previous film was the equally wickedly delightful, if slightly less violent, IN BRUGES.Colin Farrell, who also starred in IN BRUGES, plays an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who is having trouble formulating his current assignment, a screenplay entitled ""Seven Psychopaths"".  His best friend, a somewhat unstable actor (Sam Rockwell) with a penchant for punching out casting directors, realizes that Colin just needs some inspiration, so he makes it possible for him to meet some real psychopaths.Sam's ""day job"" is that of a dog kidnapper.  He and partner Christopher Walken steal people's dogs, then return them for the posted reward.  Unfortunately, they make the mistake of snatching the pooch of a crazed gangster (Woody Harrelson), who will stop at nothing to get his beloved animal back.SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS is a film of multiple layers; therefore no written synopsis would do the twist-filled plot justice.  Certain scenes are set in the real world, while others are sequences from the ""Seven Psychopaths"" screenplay in progress as imagined by Farrell, or Rockwell or Walken, both of whom have been invited to collaborate on Colin's work.Farrell is certainly a fine actor, but in this outrageously funny film he essentially plays straight man to Rockwell, Walken,  Harrelson and Tom Waits, all of whom, in this writer's opinion, should have been Oscar-nominated  for their portrayals of hilariously demented characters .Martin McDonagh's deft dialogue is a laugh-out-loud riot.Extras on the Blu-Ray and DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment include six ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes.

Moore,"[1, 2]","If Roddy Doyle, Quentin Tarantino and the Coen brothers got drunk together one night, they'd almost certainly come up with a script like those of Martin McDonagh and his brother, John Michael. Martin McDonagh, already a successful playwright, directed two gleefully bloody black comedies, the Oscar-winning short ""Six Shooter"" and the full-length ""In Bruges."" Not to be outdone, John Michael McDonagh came up with his own nihilistic comic romp, ""The Guard.""""Seven Psychopaths,"" Martin's latest movie, is the first McDonagh flick not to feature Brendan Gleeson. But although Gleeson is missed, the ensemble cast makes up for his absence. Foremost among them is Sam Rockwell as Billy Bickle, an aspiring actor who pays the bills by running a dognapping racket with his friend Hans (Christopher Walken). Rockwell, whose character can best be described as a hyperactive child on crack, brims over with ideas for the latest screenplay by his seriously blocked, seriously alcoholic best pal Martin (Colin Farrell, who also starred in ""In Bruges""). Soon, however, major trouble heads the way of Billy, Martin, and Hans, after Billy's latest dognap victim turns out to be the beloved pet of crazed mobster Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson).Like its predecessors, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is wildly funny, consistently inventive, and over-the-top violent. I will preserve its plot twists for you to discover for yourself. For me it didn't have as much bloody meat on its bones as ""In Bruges"" or ""The Guard,"" but it does raise some interesting connections between movie violence and real-life violence. (Remember how Silvio on ""The Sopranos"" loved to do his ""Godfather"" impressions? ""Seven Psychopaths"" makes the same point, but much, much more strongly.) Rockwell steals the picture, but Walken, Harrelson and Tom Waits all offer amusing variations on criminal sociopathy, and Farrell is a likably befuddled straight man. With funny cameos by Harry Dean Stanton, Gabourey Sidibe, Michael Pitt, Michael Stuhlbarg and others, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is wild fun.",4,A wild funhouse ride of a movie.,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,2043,"['Roddy', 'Doyle', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'got', 'drunk', 'together', 'one', 'night', ""'d"", 'almost', 'certainly', 'come', 'up', 'script', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'brother', 'John', 'Michael', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'already', 'successful', 'playwright', 'directed', 'two', 'gleefully', 'bloody', 'black', 'comedies', 'Oscar-winning', 'short', 'Six', 'Shooter', 'full-length', 'Bruges', 'Not', 'be', 'outdone', 'John', 'Michael', 'McDonagh', 'came', 'up', 'own', 'nihilistic', 'comic', 'romp', 'Guard', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'Martin', 'latest', 'movie', 'first', 'McDonagh', 'flick', 'not', 'feature', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Gleeson', 'missed', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'up', 'absence', 'Foremost', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Billy', 'Bickle', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'who', 'bills', 'running', 'dognapping', 'racket', 'friend', 'Hans', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Rockwell', 'character', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'hyperactive', 'child', 'crack', 'ideas', 'latest', 'screenplay', 'seriously', 'blocked', 'seriously', 'alcoholic', 'best', 'pal', 'Martin', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'Bruges', 'Soon', 'however', 'major', 'trouble', 'heads', 'way', 'Billy', 'Martin', 'Hans', 'Billy', 'latest', 'dognap', 'victim', 'out', 'be', 'beloved', 'pet', 'crazed', 'mobster', 'Charlie', 'Costello', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'predecessors', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'wildly', 'funny', 'consistently', 'inventive', 'over-the-top', 'violent', 'will', 'preserve', 'plot', 'twists', 'discover', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'bloody', 'meat', 'bones', 'Bruges', 'Guard', 'raise', 'interesting', 'connections', 'movie', 'violence', 'real-life', 'violence', 'Remember', 'how', 'Silvio', 'Sopranos', 'loved', 'do', 'Godfather', 'impressions', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'same', 'point', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'strongly', 'Rockwell', 'picture', 'Walken', 'Harrelson', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'offer', 'amusing', 'variations', 'criminal', 'sociopathy', 'Farrell', 'likably', 'befuddled', 'straight', 'man', 'funny', 'cameos', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Gabourey', 'Sidibe', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'others', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'wild', 'fun']",Seven Psychopaths

""Seven Psychopaths"" bears his signature violence, political incorrectness, and dark humor. A mystery assassin known as the ""Jack of Diamonds Killer"" is running around Los Angeles killing criminally violent people. Meanwhile Marty (Colin Farrell), a frustrated screenwriter, is stuck partway through a storyline that was given to him by his friend Billy (Sam Rockwell), partner of Hans (Christopher Walken) in a dog-kidnapping racket. Billy and Hans steal dogs from rich people and return them for a reward. But this time Billy has kidnapped Bonny, a Shih Tzu belonging to Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson), a violent single-minded gangster who really wants his dog back...and who may have met his match in Billy.McDonagh's films can never be accused of being hackneyed. This is a fresh, thoughtful, multi-layered satire. It's violent. It's very funny at times. But ""Seven Psychopaths"" is so thematically complex and reflexive that I often felt that McDonagh was overthinking the whole thing. Reflexive to the point of self-mockery, placing revenge narratives within revenge narratives, satirizing violent movies and their audience while exploiting them to make a point, the film is certainly clever. But perhaps it is more clever than good. Its comment on revenge is strange and a little inscrutable. Sam Rockwell plays Billy's crazy character to great effect. But the racial component is also strange, and the whole exercise is so crowded with ideas that it loses coherence. Sometimes McDonagh hits the mark with his brash dialogue. Other times, he falls flat.""You're the one who thought psychopaths were so interesting. They're kind of tiresome after a while, don't you think?"" says Hans to Marty. And that is, ironically, the idea behind a film about seven psychopaths. Original and occasionally shocking, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is not for the easily offended. Unfortunately, it suffers from too much of a good thing, and a lot of redundancy, packed into a super-violent dark satire that gets unbearably serious at times. I love the cast, and they give some gutsy performances. Making movies about movies is always tricky, but stripping half the material out might have made a better film.

It is difficult to feel any sympathy for the main hero as he is an abusive alcoholic. His best friend is a psychopath who has no hesitation in dispatching innocent women.The nearest character I came to liking was the Walken's morally bankrupt dog thief.It is interesting to note that the film is its own harshest critic when, about two-thirds of the way through, Marty presents a draft script to his pals based on events so far, and they tear it apart for being one-dimensional, lacking any decent female characters and sloppy dialogue.

1536736,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B007REV4LQ,Paul Allaer,"[34, 38]","Some 3-4 years ago, director Martin McDonagh teamed up with Colin Farrell in an absurd but very funny crime comedy called ""In Bruges"". I loved that movie (and not just because it was filmed in the Belgian city of Bruges, where I spent my high school years). Now comes another crime comedy from the same team.""Seven Psychopaths"" (2012 release; 110 min.) brings the story of Marty (played by Farrell), a struggling writer who is working on a movie script called ""Seven Psychopaths"". His buddy Billy (played by Sam Rockwell) is volunteering to help in any way possible. At some point Billy steals a little dog, and only later do we learn that the dog's owner is Charlie (played by Woody Harrelson), a dangerous gangster who is out for revenge. Last, but certainly not least, there is Hans (played by Christopher Walken), a buddy of Billy's. There are a bunch of smaller characters in the movie. To be honest, I had a hard time keeping track of the multitude of characters, and the fact that part of the movie is a recreation of the script that Marty is writing. A script within the script, so to speak. After a while I simply let go of it all, and just watched the movie for what it is, regardless of the actual or percieved plot lines: another absurd (and I do mean that as a compliment) crime drama.Couple of side comments: with apologies to Colin Farrell, but in my opinion Sam Rockwell steals the movie. His acting is sharp and he brings his character in a way that made me smile if not laugh out loud, just by seeing him. I also was surprised to see that this movie is not just playing at the art house here in Cincinnati (where I saw it), but also at a number of mainstream mulitplexes. The movie was not very well attended when I saw it this past weekend, and I can't imnagine that a dark and violent movie like this one, even with plenty of humor and comedy, will be a big hit, but I could be wrong of course.

So he's stuck.But his friends, Hans (Christopher Walken), and Billy (Sam Rockwell), help him out.  Hans and Billy support themselves by dog-kidnapping, a low-level scam that sometimes nets them effusive rewards from the grateful owners.  (They don't threaten; just keep the dogs a couple of days silently, then return them as ""found."")Both Hans and Billy turn out to be nutcases in their own way, and both help Martin develop his psychopath stories.  Billy points out a newspaper story about a mysterious, masked Jack of Diamonds killer who only kills mafia hitmen.  A serial-killer killer.Billy also places a personal ad for psychopaths in a little freebie paper, which turns up Tom Waits.  Waits carries around a white rabbit, and tells his strange history of rescuing a young woman decades ago who had been captured by a serial killer.  He and she kill the killer and then go on a long campaign of killing serial killers, including, among others, the Zodiac.  Another pair of serial-killer killers.Hans connects up with another psychopath-story, about a Quaker whose daughter is murdered by a psychopath.  The murderer is caught and jailed, but the Quaker forms a vendetta and pursues him--into jail and beyond, even though the killer has reformed.  Hans apparently is the Quaker.  Hans also resolves Martin's Vengeful-Vietnamese-Priest story relatively peacefully.Hans and Billy's dog-napping enterprise goes seriously awry when Billy dognaps the Shih-Tsu of a mafia general (Woody Harrelson).Billy wants to have a big shootout with the mafia men, but Hans is a pacifist and Martin hates violence, so they drive out to the desert to mull it over.Oh, and by the way, without spoiling anything, Billy is seriously and deeply and crazily misogynist.It all ends strangely with Martin and Hans and Billy each getting what he wants.There's a shocking amount of gore and a lot of meditation on whether violence can ever be used against violence.And Billy, who is the only genuine psychopath, steals the show.Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken and Woody Harrelson are terrific, and so are all the women actors, though they have small-to-middling parts.

It's like a comedy version of Taxi Driver. You have these actors going through the ins and outs of being a psychopath on screen and doing crazy crap, and that's just not what the preview made the movie come across as. Yes, there was supposed to be general insaneness and killing--but there's really no main comedy tone, it's mostly a sad depressing tone about the varying levels of being a psychopath and what the psychopaths want from their drama to fulfill their psychopathic desires. That would be the main theme of the movie, how each psycho feels about their drama and what they want from the drama they hope to create in their lives.I thought it was a little disgusting there was so much violence against women in this movie. That's where I really regretted renting it. There was real drama against women, there was a lot of it, there were fantasies about it, and at that point, despite being able to get through the nasty sex scenes, the crazy, violent, and grotesque for anyone's standards, murders, (and by anyone's standards that is not a joke because I had some pretty twisted English professors in college who made AN ALL GIRLS DETECTIVE NOVEL CLASS read super-duper sick rape literature) it just became a little too heavy, and I would not rent the movie again. I personally hate the Godfather movies because there is so much crazy, arbitrary, gross, and unnecessary raging, violence, and revenge against women....and I think that's only entertaining for psycopathic, psycopathetic males.

The fact that they the fact that they are all on hand in Seven Psychopaths, let's you know that straight away you are in for a treatComing from writer-director Martin McDonagh, whose great In Bruges was released a little over four years ago to great acclaim and a Golden Globe win for it's star, Colin Farrell, the star here. Seven Psychopaths has many of the same qualities as In Bruges, it is a clever and well written cross pollinated comedy and crime drama.Taking a self aware approach to the art of moviemaking, it is set in the outskirts of the movie industry and it's lead characters are an actor (Rockwell) and a screenwriter (Farrell). The writer is working on a script cheekily titled ""Seven Psychopaths"", he needs to find said psychopaths so his friend places a personal ad that attracts at least one crazy (Waits) to him.But he doesn't have to look far as psychopaths are all around him. First his buddy is running a dog kidnapping for profit scheme with an older man (Walken), who comes with a series of surprises. They unknowingly abduct the dog of a mobster (Harrelson) who will stop at nothing to get his four legged friend back.Full of quirky and very funny situations that don't seem as if they will add up in the end, but they surely do. Where this picture is going is never clear, but it is a lot of fun getting there. It doesn't lead itself to the heights of In Bruges, but it comes mighty close. Using the same kind of violence and compassion laced with loads of humor, it is all played as a joke this time around, but still one with a lot ofv bloodshed.Like Quentin Tarantino, McDonagh has an ear for clever witty dialogue. Also like Tarantino he takes a rather mundane, perhaps worn out premise and turns it inside out, finding knowledgeable new ways to tell an old story.As a send of the movie industry, Seven Psychopaths has a  lot of fun attacking conventions and clich&eacute;s. It feels often like it is bound to loose it's self, but McDonagh has a good knowing directing style that helps keep everything in check.And that cast, I don't know what more can be said for it except it is spot on for this sort of absurdist satirical movie. Not the funniest movie of the year, I still think Killer Joe was, still there are a lot of good laughs that come from the sharp words spoken by a quirky bunch you will not see this season. The whole cast is at the top of their collective game and Farrell has found a collaborator in McDonagh who works towards his strengths, something the big Hollywood productions like the Total Recall and Fright Night reduxes have not done.An intense and refreshing movie, and there are so few of them released any more. Seven Psychopaths is a little gem that was sort of lost amongst the bigger more high profile movies of the fall. Now on blu-ray and DVD, hopefully this minor masterpiece will find the adoring audience that it most deserves.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",4,dognappers inc.,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,3116,"['Colin', 'Farrell', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'usually', 'actors', 'are', 'most', 'interesting', 'performer', 'on-screen', 'given', 'time', 'fact', 'fact', 'are', 'hand', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'let', 'know', 'straight', 'away', 'are', 'treatComing', 'writer-director', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'great', 'Bruges', 'was', 'released', 'little', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'great', 'acclaim', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'win', 'star', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'star', 'here', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'many', 'same', 'qualities', 'Bruges', 'clever', 'well', 'written', 'cross', 'pollinated', 'comedy', 'crime', 'drama.Taking', 'self', 'aware', 'approach', 'art', 'moviemaking', 'set', 'outskirts', 'movie', 'industry', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'actor', 'Rockwell', 'screenwriter', 'Farrell', 'writer', 'working', 'script', 'cheekily', 'titled', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'find', 'said', 'psychopaths', 'friend', 'personal', 'ad', 'least', 'one', 'crazy', 'Waits', 'him.But', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'far', 'psychopaths', 'are', 'First', 'buddy', 'running', 'dog', 'kidnapping', 'profit', 'scheme', 'older', 'man', 'Walken', 'who', 'series', 'surprises', 'unknowingly', 'abduct', 'dog', 'mobster', 'Harrelson', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'four', 'legged', 'friend', 'back.Full', 'quirky', 'very', 'funny', 'situations', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'will', 'add', 'up', 'end', 'surely', 'do', 'Where', 'picture', 'going', 'never', 'clear', 'lot', 'fun', 'getting', 'there', ""n't"", 'lead', 'heights', 'Bruges', 'mighty', 'close', 'Using', 'same', 'kind', 'violence', 'compassion', 'laced', 'loads', 'humor', 'all', 'played', 'joke', 'time', 'around', 'still', 'one', 'lot', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'McDonagh', 'ear', 'clever', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'Also', 'Tarantino', 'rather', 'mundane', 'perhaps', 'worn', 'out', 'premise', 'finding', 'knowledgeable', 'new', 'ways', 'tell', 'old', 'story.As', 'send', 'movie', 'industry', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'lot', 'fun', 'attacking', 'conventions', 'clich', 'eacute', 's.', 'feels', 'often', 'bound', 'loose', 'McDonagh', 'good', 'knowing', 'directing', 'style', 'keep', 'everything', 'check.And', 'cast', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'spot', 'sort', 'absurdist', 'satirical', 'movie', 'Not', 'funniest', 'movie', 'year', 'still', 'think', 'Killer', 'Joe', 'was', 'still', 'are', 'lot', 'good', 'laughs', 'come', 'sharp', 'words', 'spoken', 'quirky', 'bunch', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'season', 'whole', 'cast', 'top', 'collective', 'game', 'Farrell', 'found', 'collaborator', 'McDonagh', 'who', 'strengths', 'something', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Fright', 'Night', 'reduxes', 'have', 'not', 'done.An', 'intense', 'refreshing', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'released', 'more', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'little', 'gem', 'was', 'sort', 'lost', 'bigger', 'more', 'high', 'profile', 'movies', 'fall', 'Now', 'blu-ray', 'DVD', 'hopefully', 'minor', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'find', 'adoring', 'audience', 'most', 'deserves.see', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",Seven Psychopaths

1536785,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B007REV4LQ,Steven Aldersley,"[3, 4]","I've been waiting for the release of Seven Psychopaths ever since I learned that Martin McDonagh was writing and directing. If you have seen In Bruges, you'll know that McDonagh has a dark sense of humor, not too far removed from something Quentin Tarantino might be involved with.Does Seven Psychopaths match the brilliance of In Bruges? Not quite, but it's still an entertaining movie.Marty (Farrell) is a struggling screenwriter, who has decided on little more than the title, Seven Psychopaths. The problem is, he wants his psychopaths to be Buddhist, and he can't see how they would go around killing people. He decides to make one Amish instead, for no particular reason. Marty doesn't have a clue about writing.His friends, Billy (Rockwell) and Hans (Walken), make money by dognapping and returning the animals to their owners in order to claim the reward money. This backfires when they inadvertently take a dog belonging to Charlie (Harrelson), who is some kind of crime lord. You only have to read the tag on the collar of his beloved Shih Tzu to understand Charlie's outlook on life.Seven Psychopaths is a comedy. It's also extremely violent at times, and has more than its fair share of foul language (including the word that almost every woman detests), with brief nudity and occasional racist remarks. But it's obvious that everything is tongue-in-cheek. It's almost impossible to mistake the movie for a serious drama; it's a fun ride, and the R-rated material does not seem offensive or out of place.I've already mentioned Tarantino, and for good reason. The genre and setting are almost irrelevant; this is an exercise in style, and you'll either love it or hate it. Dialogue is everything in this type of movie and most of the writing is inventive, witty and intelligent. The opening scene is reminiscent of Pulp Fiction, with two hit men talking nonsense. The scene ends in an unexpected way, and I won't reveal it here, but it sets the tone for the whole movie.McDonagh is aware of the course that Hollywood action movies are supposed to follow, and Seven Psychopaths challenges those expectations. One character suggests that they pitch a tent in the middle of the desert so they can just sit there and talk, rather than having a traditional shootout with the bad guys. In response, his friend asks whether this is a French movie. It's that kind of humor. Another interchange observes that women have a rough deal in this story; when they aren't being verbally abused, they are in danger of being removed permanently.I won't say any more about the plot because it's enjoyable seeing things gradually unfold on the screen, except to say that my favorite scene featured Hans making a suggestion about how to end the movie. Walken's comic timing is excellent as always, and his scenes are funnier when you think about some of the characters he has played in the past.The movie features good performances from Rockwell, Walken, Harrelson and Farrell in particular, although nobody else delivers a weak performance. The audience in my theater laughed often, and occasionally groaned at the unexpected violent scenes. If you go in expecting a dark comedy along the lines of In Bruges, Fargo, or The Guard, you'll likely enjoy the experience. The pacing feels just right.One thing I should add is that it's best to sit through the credits, or you will miss the final scene.I'm looking forward to the Blu-ray and the next McDonagh movie. It would be fun to see Brendan Gleeson involved too.",4,My kind of humor,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,3503,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'release', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'ever', 'learned', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'was', 'writing', 'directing', 'have', 'seen', 'Bruges', ""'ll"", 'know', 'McDonagh', 'dark', 'sense', 'humor', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'something', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'might', 'be', 'involved', 'with.Does', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'match', 'brilliance', 'Bruges', 'Not', 'quite', 'still', 'entertaining', 'movie.Marty', 'Farrell', 'struggling', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'decided', 'little', 'more', 'title', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'problem', 'psychopaths', 'be', 'Buddhist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'would', 'go', 'killing', 'people', 'make', 'one', 'Amish', 'instead', 'particular', 'reason', 'Marty', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'writing.His', 'friends', 'Billy', 'Rockwell', 'Hans', 'Walken', 'make', 'money', 'dognapping', 'returning', 'animals', 'owners', 'order', 'claim', 'reward', 'money', 'when', 'inadvertently', 'take', 'dog', 'belonging', 'Charlie', 'Harrelson', 'who', 'kind', 'crime', 'lord', 'only', 'have', 'read', 'tag', 'collar', 'beloved', 'Shih', 'Tzu', 'understand', 'Charlie', 'outlook', 'life.Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'comedy', 'also', 'extremely', 'violent', 'times', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'foul', 'language', 'including', 'word', 'almost', 'woman', 'brief', 'nudity', 'occasional', 'racist', 'remarks', 'obvious', 'everything', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'almost', 'impossible', 'mistake', 'movie', 'serious', 'drama', 'fun', 'ride', 'R-rated', 'material', 'not', 'seem', 'offensive', 'place.I', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'Tarantino', 'good', 'reason', 'genre', 'setting', 'are', 'almost', 'irrelevant', 'exercise', 'style', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'Dialogue', 'everything', 'type', 'movie', 'most', 'writing', 'inventive', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'opening', 'scene', 'reminiscent', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'two', 'hit', 'men', 'talking', 'nonsense', 'scene', 'unexpected', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'here', 'tone', 'whole', 'movie.McDonagh', 'aware', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'follow', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'expectations', 'One', 'character', 'pitch', 'tent', 'middle', 'desert', 'can', 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'talk', 'rather', 'having', 'traditional', 'shootout', 'bad', 'guys', 'response', 'friend', 'French', 'movie', 'kind', 'humor', 'interchange', 'women', 'have', 'rough', 'deal', 'story', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'being', 'verbally', 'abused', 'are', 'danger', 'being', 'removed', 'permanently.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'plot', 'enjoyable', 'seeing', 'things', 'gradually', 'unfold', 'screen', 'say', 'favorite', 'scene', 'featured', 'Hans', 'making', 'suggestion', 'how', 'end', 'movie', 'Walken', 'comic', 'timing', 'excellent', 'always', 'scenes', 'are', 'funnier', 'when', 'think', 'characters', 'played', 'past.The', 'movie', 'features', 'good', 'performances', 'Rockwell', 'Walken', 'Harrelson', 'Farrell', 'particular', 'nobody', 'else', 'weak', 'performance', 'audience', 'theater', 'laughed', 'often', 'occasionally', 'groaned', 'unexpected', 'violent', 'scenes', 'go', 'expecting', 'dark', 'comedy', 'lines', 'Bruges', 'Fargo', 'Guard', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'enjoy', 'experience', 'pacing', 'feels', 'just', 'right.One', 'thing', 'should', 'add', 'best', 'sit', 'credits', 'will', 'miss', 'final', 'scene.I', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'Blu-ray', 'next', 'McDonagh', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'see', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'involved', 'too']",Seven Psychopaths

I love Christopher Walken when he plays ""Quirky, Funny"" Characters, and that is the reason I decided to watch this movie.  As I suspected, Walken was Amazing as a 60 something ""Dog Kidnapper"" named ""Hans"" with a sad past and a challenging present. Hans was quirky, compassionate and a great friend to Sam Rockwell's Character, Billy.Billy was an Actor who was having a tough time getting parts because of his temper. He was a longtime friend of Marty's, Colin Ferrel.  Marty was writing his new screenplay called ""Seven Psychopaths"" and was having a terrible time choosing the Psychopaths, and grappling with what kind of a message he wanted his movie to portray. Billy took it upon himself to ""Help"" Marty find the Seven Psychopath Characters and help write the plot of the movie, only after much discussion and arguing whether Marty wanted his help or not. Billy comes up with finding characters in some unconventional ways and hilarity ensues.In the meantime Billy kidnaps his girlfriends,""Gangster"" boyfriend, Charlie's, (Harrelson) beloved dog. Charlie is crazy in love with his little dog and cares more for the dog than the humans around him. Harrelson plays this role of the ""Psychopath Gangster"" perfectly!  Charlie tells his goons to find the kidnapper and get his dog back, one thing leads to another and Charlie finds out Billy has his dog.Billy, Marty and Hans go into the dessert to work on the ""Script"" and Billy tries to make Marty write the movie the way he wants it to be. There are arguments, alcohol, and peyote consumed, and things are revealed that Marty can't deal with. Billy doesn't want Marty to leave, so he makes them stranded out in the desert and he calls Charlie to tell him to come and get his dog. Billy leaves them with only one choice and that is to end Marty's movie his way.Sam Rockwell stole the show with his hilarious portrayal of Billy!

1536799,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B007REV4LQ,The People's Critic,"[3, 3]","Seven Psychopathsis Martin McDonagh's follow-up to his quirky 2008 hit, In Bruges.  McDonagh is making a name for himself as his two films complement each other nicely and provide a roadmap for the type of director McDonagh aspires to be.  Like Tarantino or Hitchcock, McDonagh strives to make films about similar types of characters viewed through a similar societal lens.  Awareness seems to be McDonagh's trademark.  His characters are flawed, yet keenly aware of these flaws.  His scripts are dark, yet this darkness is carefully tempered by his films' awareness of the fact that they are films, as his characters are always interacting with the film industry in some way.  This awareness allows the viewer to enjoy his films on multiple levels, first on a narrative level and again on a satirical level that tries to provide commentary on humanity through the narrative.In the case of Seven Psychopaths, McDonagh turns his focused lens on an unfocused, alcoholic screenwriter, Marty (Colin Ferrell).  Marty is struggling to write a film called Seven Psychopaths and turns to his friends and their acquaintances for inspirations on ways to characterize his seven different psychopathic characters.  What follows is a wild series of events that lead Marty down the literal Psycho-Path to self-realization.  As his characters become fleshed out, Marty starts to see that he's living a detached life.  His detached life is illustrated by the flaws of his screenplay.  Marty's writing is not authentic.  He borrows from other people's lives to write his characters, and his tragic personal life causes his women characters to be nothing but fragile stereotypes.  His relationship is in shambles, his inspiration is drying up, Marty is desperate for a motivation, and thanks to a mixed up con-gone-wrong by his dog kidnapping grifter friends, Hans and Billy (Christopher Walken and Sam Rockwell), this motivation comes in the form of an LA underground gangster (Woody Harrelson) who is seriously upset about his kidnapped Shi-tszu.Seven Psychopaths is a busy film and it is also McDonagh's most brutal.  There is so much going on that its stars only have a matter of minutes to shine.  Standouts are Rockwell and Walken.  Rockwell's Billy is a fast-talking idea man.  He's relentless and firing on all cylinders in every scene.  Walken plays Hans, who is much more relaxed than Billy, but equally fun to watch.  Walken is doing a Walken impression here, which is basically what people have come to want from him in this phase of his career.  Regarding its brutality, from the opening scene, the film's tone is quite clear.  While trailers might lead one to believe that the dog kidnapping plotline is central to the story, it is actually a very minor element.  The majority of the film's 109 minutes explores exactly what happens when the ""inmates take over the insane asylum.""  Desert shootouts, sadistic serial killers, and revenge killings pepper the action of the film.  Seven Psychopaths feels inspired by the independent films of the 90s.  As it unfolds, it is reminiscent of 1994s Floundering or 1995's Living in Oblivion not in plot (or in casting James LeGros), but in its meaning.  These films blend the effects of fantasy and reality in a compelling way, creating a very enjoyable movie.  If only James LeGros could have shown up as an eighth psychopath!

1536810,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B007REV4LQ,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Marty (Colin Farrell) is a Hollywood writer having a writer&#8217;s block (and a drinking problem, too) trying desperately to come up with an idea for the next project titled &#8220;Seven Psychopaths.&#8221; The idea arrives in an unexpected way when his officious friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) steals a dog that happened to be a sadistic gangster&#8217;s.Though set in Hollywood, &#8220;Seven Psychopaths&#8221; is a British crime comedy with a great cast including Christopher Walken, Woody Harrelson and Tom Waits, as well as interesting cameos from Michael Pitt, Gabourey Sidibe and Harry Dean Stanton. This is a sophomore work of Martin McDonagh (&#8220;In Bruges&#8221;) as a feature director, which means something for avid filmgoers. The film is often very violent.Not that I take issue with that. The problem is, despite the effective dark humor, &#8220;Seven Psychopaths&#8221; relies too much on violence to further the story, which goes nowhere in the second half. The film often looks like an assortment of discarded ideas for films that did not materialize. The characters&#8217; self-referential remarks (about female characters, for instance) sound more like an excuse than humor.The best thing of the interesting but overlong film is naturally Christopher Walken and his character Hans, a person with a dark and mysterious background. His back story alone, the most thought-out and intriguing one among others, is worth watching. On the contrary, female characters played by Abbie Cornish and Olga Kurylenko are little better than cyphers, or worse.And writer / director Martin McDonagh obviously knows that, as that&#8217;s exactly what one character in the film points out. This is where smugness gets the film, which stops being what it started out to be, a crime drama about seven psychopaths. Instead, it ends up being a commentary about itself, which is not really smart or interesting as it seems to think.",3,Chrsitopher Walken Is Great But The Film Is Striving Too Hard to Be Smart,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,1928,"['Marty', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Hollywood', 'writer', 'having', 'writer', '8217', 'block', 'drinking', 'problem', 'too', 'trying', 'desperately', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'next', 'project', 'titled', '8220', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths.', '8221', 'idea', 'unexpected', 'way', 'when', 'officious', 'friend', 'Billy', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'dog', 'happened', 'be', 'sadistic', 'gangster', '8217', 's.Though', 'set', 'Hollywood', '8220', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', '8221', 'British', 'crime', 'comedy', 'great', 'cast', 'including', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'cameos', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Gabourey', 'Sidibe', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'sophomore', 'work', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', '8220', 'Bruges', '8221', 'feature', 'director', 'something', 'avid', 'filmgoers', 'film', 'often', 'very', 'violent.Not', 'take', 'issue', 'problem', 'effective', 'dark', 'humor', '8220', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', '8221', 'relies', 'too', 'much', 'violence', 'further', 'story', 'nowhere', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'often', 'assortment', 'discarded', 'ideas', 'films', 'did', 'not', 'materialize', 'characters', '8217', 'self-referential', 'remarks', 'female', 'characters', 'instance', 'sound', 'more', 'excuse', 'humor.The', 'best', 'thing', 'interesting', 'overlong', 'film', 'naturally', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'character', 'Hans', 'person', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'background', 'back', 'story', 'alone', 'most', 'thought-out', 'intriguing', 'one', 'others', 'worth', 'watching', 'contrary', 'female', 'characters', 'played', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'are', 'little', 'better', 'cyphers', 'worse.And', 'writer', '/', 'director', 'Martin', 'McDonagh', 'obviously', 'that', '8217', 'exactly', 'what', 'one', 'character', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'where', 'smugness', 'film', 'being', 'what', 'started', 'out', 'be', 'crime', 'drama', 'seven', 'psychopaths', 'Instead', 'up', 'being', 'commentary', 'not', 'really', 'smart', 'interesting', 'think']",Seven Psychopaths
1536811,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B007REV4LQ,Turfseer,"[11, 35]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Seven Psychopaths' is by Martin McDonagh, an alleged 'noted' playwright turned screenwriter. A better appellation for Mr. McDonagh, would simply be, 'hack'. One can surmise that McDonagh's 'psychopaths', is an attempt to write some kind of farce or 'black comedy', satirizing hyper-violent action movies. McDonagh fails to grasp the mechanics of farce, in which you're permitted the outrage, without the consequences.One lame example of this, is the exploding head sequence. As it's a scene that's part of a fantasy, the exploding head is outrageous, but without consequences. Hence, it qualifies (barely) as farce. Not so the entirely tasteless scene, where Charlie guns down Hans' cancer-stricken wife, Myra, in the hospital. It's a scene that is outrageous in its cruelty and with consequences--within the context of the story, we have no reason to feel this event is amusing in the least. Han's passive reaction to the murder of his wife is perhaps also supposed to be humorous (in a passive-aggressive way), but I found the entire sequence involving the shooting of Myra, to be completely inappropriate, and indicative of McDonagh's complete misunderstanding as to how to craft a successful satire.The ugliness of McDonagh's humor (reflected in the Myra sequence) is borne out by Mike LaSalle's review in the SF Chronicle. He writes: ""In the end, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is an immersion in ugliness and violence, barely relieved by wit. It's not a comment on an ugly, crazy world, nor is it a response to an ugly, crazy world. It's just ugly all on its own - and not nearly as crazy as it should be.""There's also a sense that McDonagh wants everything, 'both ways'. As much as he seeks to mock the hyper-violent action genre, he is also seduced by it. Kenneth Turan writing in the LA Times senses this: ""Like screen writing Marty, who wants to pen a violent psychopath tale that is also life-affirming, this film wants to deliver genre satisfactions while simultaneously subverting them. It's a difficult maneuver, and ""Seven Psychopaths"" doesn't quite pull it off."" Ann Hornaday in the Washington Post also echoes McDonagh's infatuation with violence: ""But the film also begins to feel like a case of a director getting to revel in the very thing he's reviling."" Kevin Jagernauth, writing in The Playlist, agrees with the 'both ways' theory: ""Boasting lots of gun-play, a big extended cast of stars willing to play along and a less witty, broader sense of humor, McDonagh tries to have it both ways by playing to the cheap seats while pointing out how absurd it is at the same time.""The 'Seven Psychopaths' plot revolves around Colin Farrell's character, Marty Faranan, an alcoholic screenwriter, who suffers from writer's block, and only has gotten as far as composing a title for his next work. Marty's best friend, the unemployed actor Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell), suggests that he use the 'Jack of Diamonds' serial killer as his Psychopath #1 for the screenplay (it turns out later that Bickle is actually the Jack of Diamonds killer, a murderer who kills other killers). Not all the psychopaths are real life characters; Marty dreams up perhaps the only interesting character in his pantheon of killers--a Quaker who stalks his daughter's killer and in an O'Henry-like twist, drives the killer to suicide, and follows him to hell when he slits his own throat.McDonagh intentionally makes his characters as unlikeable as possible, including Bickle and Hans (Christopher Walken) who steal dogs from their unsuspecting owners, only to return them to collect the reward money. The break into Act II occurs, when Bickle and Hans steal a Shih Tzu that belongs to Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson), a sadistic gangster, whose bent on retrieving the pooch at any cost.If this isn't enough, Marty's ad in the paper for more psychopaths, brings Zachariah Rigby, who used to go around the country with a girl, Maggie, who he saved after she was imprisoned in a serial killer's basement. In true Tarrantino fashion, the couple are seen in flashbacks, going around the country, hacking the hands off notable serial murderers, including the Zodiac Killer. Zachariah has Marty promise that he'll place a notice in the screen credits at the end of 'Seven Psychopaths', so he may re-unite with the long lost Maggie.The denouement of 'Seven Psychopaths' occurs when Marty, Hans and Bickle drive out to the desert. In a completely absurd scene, Charlie, drives out alone to meet them, carrying only a flare gun. When Bickle shoots Charlie in the back, it looks like it's curtains for him, but in a short amount of time, Charlie reveals it's only a 'flesh wound' and Marty attempts to save him by driving him back to town.I won't go into the ending since by this time, we've long lost caring for any of the characters. McDonagh's idea of humor is to stretch both his characters and situations to the maximum level of absurdity. This strategy backfires, as we soon come to realize that it's not enough to offset McDonagh's guilty pleasure: the love of violence!",1,McDonagh can't hide his love for hyper-violent action thrillers

1536812,A3JLOIXFM75QNV,B007REV4LQ,"Valerya Couto ""LOTRsherlockHPFreak""","[5, 6]","Seven Psychopaths is a hard film to review. To describe the plot details would be to ruin the film, plus-it's not the easiest film to really write a synopsis for. I'll try to keep it simple: Screenplay writer struggling to come up with a story for his latest movie gets help with the plot from a good friend of his, who also happens to be a dog nabber. One day he nabs the wrong pooch-a little shih tzu named Bonnie who happens to belong to a really dangerous guy. Stuff happens, bad stuff ensues. The name of the film comes into play throughout, but again, I won't spoil what each psychopath stands for. This film clearly wants to be comedic in nature, but it has quite a few dramatic moments that don't really feel out of place. There is LOTS of blood, gore and violence. Some of it almost seems for violence sake, but you get a sense of what this film will be like from the very first moments. Someone reviewed and stated it was 'all nudity'. I think I can maybe think of one scene in the whole movie that had any nudity and it really wasn't all that lurid. I don't know what that person was watching, but it wasn't this.The movie looks great in Blu-ray and sounds great too. It's filled to the brim with great actors and each one brings their own thing to the table. Yes, some of it is overacting but here it works quite well. There are some twists and surprises, some a tad predictable, but I thought it was an interesting film. Not to be taken seriously. People who enjoy dark comedies, and don't mind violence will get a kick out of this. Again, a few people are complaining about a lack of plot. Not every plot has to be linear and full of thousands of details. I am usually pretty picky with films but couldn't really find anything major to complain about.
