1383501,A21U4E6Y4Q4H30,B0042RJWRY,"E. Lombard ""Lizasaurus""","[0, 1]",I really loved this dvd as I collect everything about Laura Ingalls Wilder.  The stories had more true parts than the orginal series of Little House on The Prairie.  I thought Richard Thomas was excellent as Charles Ingalls and he looked more like the character described in the books.  The actor who played Caroline was ok but she actually looked older than her husband. It is a shame they did not portray Mary and Laura more acurately - it would not have been difficult to colour their hair correctly as that was really important because it was constantly mentioned in the books as Laura often envied Mary her beautiful blond hair against her brown hair.It is such a shame they cannot follow the books correctly at least most of the time! There were many really good parts of the actual story that were just left out and the time frame was so wrong in several parts.  Also many characters were completely left out.  It would have been better if they had had more episodes instead of trying to cram so much into just two episodes. But I still loved this dvd as it was very different to the other series which I also loved even though a lot of it was pure fiction.I would love someone to make a film or series about the latter part of Laura's life when she went to San Francisco to stay with Rose.  Also when she visited her sisters and one found out a lot more about what happened to the rest of her family.Laura was a remarkable person and a true pioneer so the story of her and her family is well worth a lot more telling but in a more accurate way.  I am disappointed I cannot find out more about what happened to Rose - her marriage failure - the loss of her son - how it came about that she had an adopted or godson who told a little aboout her life.I have read all the history of her family (the maternal side) beginning in Scotland and it is really interesting.,5,Beyond the Prairie - True Story of Laura Ingalls,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,1869,"['really', 'loved', 'dvd', 'collect', 'everything', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'stories', 'had', 'more', 'true', 'parts', 'orginal', 'series', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'thought', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'was', 'excellent', 'Charles', 'Ingalls', 'looked', 'more', 'character', 'described', 'books', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Caroline', 'was', 'ok', 'actually', 'looked', 'older', 'husband', 'shame', 'did', 'not', 'portray', 'Mary', 'Laura', 'more', 'acurately', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'colour', 'hair', 'correctly', 'was', 'really', 'important', 'was', 'constantly', 'mentioned', 'books', 'Laura', 'often', 'envied', 'Mary', 'beautiful', 'blond', 'hair', 'brown', 'hair.It', 'such', 'shame', 'can', 'not', 'follow', 'books', 'correctly', 'least', 'most', 'time', 'were', 'many', 'really', 'good', 'parts', 'actual', 'story', 'were', 'just', 'left', 'out', 'time', 'frame', 'was', 'so', 'wrong', 'several', 'parts', 'Also', 'many', 'characters', 'were', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'had', 'more', 'episodes', 'instead', 'trying', 'cram', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'two', 'episodes', 'still', 'loved', 'dvd', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'series', 'also', 'loved', 'even', 'lot', 'was', 'pure', 'fiction.I', 'would', 'love', 'someone', 'make', 'film', 'series', 'latter', 'part', 'Laura', 'life', 'when', 'went', 'San', 'Francisco', 'stay', 'Rose', 'Also', 'when', 'visited', 'sisters', 'one', 'found', 'lot', 'more', 'what', 'happened', 'rest', 'family.Laura', 'was', 'remarkable', 'person', 'true', 'pioneer', 'story', 'family', 'well', 'lot', 'more', 'telling', 'more', 'accurate', 'way', 'am', 'disappointed', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'what', 'happened', 'Rose', 'marriage', 'failure', 'loss', 'son', 'how', 'came', 'had', 'adopted', 'godson', 'who', 'told', 'little', 'aboout', 'life.I', 'have', 'read', 'history', 'family', 'maternal', 'side', 'beginning', 'Scotland', 'really', 'interesting']",N/A

1383512,A1IUE52O75XPZS,B0042RJWRY,teatime,"[3, 4]","Like others here, I found the changes to Laura's true story disheartening and unneccessary.  To begin with, this movie is NOT the ""true story"" of LIW.  So yes, purists should just back away now, re-read the books and avoid the aggravation of watching this and finding fault (because that is inevitable here)...  Those willing to make MANY allowances might still enjoy this film, despite it's many innaccuracies, but to do so, you have to ignore the idea that it is a true story!  I have only seen part one, as part two is so hard to find.  So I'll preface with this: within the first 5 minutes, we see a magical UFO/Meteor? fly across the screen & start a prairie fire (in DeSmet).  It was weird, surprising and hilarious to me.  So, if you can't deal with that little nugget, then don't watch this film! :-D  While this movie is much more faithful to the books than the tv series was, that still doesn't make it ""true"".  As a matter of fact, they changed many facts for no apparent reason.  Despite the many changes to her story and found that it is a decent movie that is loosely based on Laura's accounts from her books ""The Long Winter"" up through ""The First Four Years"" (in Part 1).  It brings to life many wonderful anecdotes & minor details from the last few books, while completely changing others.The Good: you can expect to hear many of Pa's real songs played on the fiddle, Laura and Manly have great chemistry, Pa & Mary are lovely, and other details such as the Bouchie's (""Brewsters"") miserable household, the hard winter, Almanzo's favorite food, the first four years, etc.The actress playing Laura does a fair job (she's not terrible), but she did open her mouth too much, which made her seem modern, ill-bred or dim-witted.  She also lacked the Victorian appearance & manners, which the real Laura adhered to.  I can forgive that the actress had the wrong build & body, but they really should at least have styled her hair up, rather than loose, and obviously she should have brown, not blonde hair!  She should also appear in a bonnet and not in a man's hat!  However, I could look past those details, while others are harder to ignore..THE WORST: No one ""looks"" like the character they are playing (Laura should be a brunette, Mary a blonde, Ma is a brunette, Pa should have a longer hair & longer beard, etc.).  This is so annoying because we have surviving family portraits, so there's no excuse. Caroline Ingalls would never openly and brusquely defy Charles in front of the girls--she was always a gracious and often silent lady. Ma is also loving and not so cold and bitter as depicted in the movie.  Also, showing Pa Ingalls asking Laura to work for money to help him pay the bills was also a big no-no.  Charles never did that! Laura was happy to offer to work to help her family of her own accord and it was her own idea to do so, many times.  Whatever inconvenience to her, Laura was always proud and eager to help her folks and sister Mary.  Why they changed this and other details such as how Laura and Almanzo met I don't know.  Also, all the sisters are merely like scenery.  Only Mary has a few meager lines. They even go so far as to suggest that Laura would ask Almanzo to ""make love"" in the outdoors!  They took quite a liberty there!! I have to say, that this impertinence & the suggestion that Laura was not a lady-like Victorian outraged me.  She's also wearing a grey dress on their wedding day, rather than the black one; she wears 2 wedding rings, etc. etc...and I could endlessly point out such things.  These little things could have been pure gold to LIW fans HAD they been ACCURATE.  Too bad!  Such a wasted opportunity! :-(  I did however learn to appreciate what they did get right, the settings, little sweet moments here and there, a nice (if made up) romance, etc...  I especially loved Pa, although he also lacked the Victorian polish he should have had!So folks, if you can get past these changes, it's a sweet, harmless movie and it works if you have no expectations or if you just watch it as a schmaltzy movie, somewhat ""Little House""-ish.  It's a mostly enjoyable film IF you can let go of the facts.  Heck, I even shed a few tears.  It's a very wholesome film, but to the purists, it will probably incite them to riot!",3,Let go of your expectations or skip it!,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,4276,"['others', 'here', 'found', 'changes', 'Laura', 'true', 'story', 'disheartening', 'unneccessary', 'begin', 'movie', 'NOT', 'true', 'story', 'LIW', 'So', 'yes', 'purists', 'should', 'just', 'back', 'away', 'now', 're-read', 'books', 'avoid', 'aggravation', 'watching', 'finding', 'fault', 'inevitable', 'here', 'willing', 'make', 'MANY', 'allowances', 'might', 'still', 'enjoy', 'film', 'many', 'innaccuracies', 'do', 'so', 'have', 'ignore', 'idea', 'true', 'story', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'part', 'one', 'part', 'two', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'So', ""'ll"", 'preface', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'see', 'magical', 'UFO/Meteor', 'fly', 'screen', 'start', 'prairie', 'fire', 'DeSmet', 'was', 'weird', 'surprising', 'hilarious', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'little', 'nugget', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', '-D', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'faithful', 'books', 'tv', 'series', 'was', 'still', ""n't"", 'make', 'true', 'matter', 'fact', 'changed', 'many', 'facts', 'apparent', 'reason', 'many', 'changes', 'story', 'found', 'decent', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'Laura', 'accounts', 'books', 'Long', 'Winter', 'up', 'First', 'Four', 'Years', 'Part', '1', 'life', 'many', 'wonderful', 'anecdotes', 'minor', 'details', 'last', 'few', 'books', 'completely', 'changing', 'others.The', 'Good', 'can', 'expect', 'hear', 'many', 'Pa', 'real', 'songs', 'played', 'fiddle', 'Laura', 'Manly', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Pa', 'Mary', 'are', 'lovely', 'other', 'details', 'such', 'Bouchie', 'Brewsters', 'miserable', 'household', 'hard', 'winter', 'Almanzo', 'favorite', 'food', 'first', 'four', 'years', 'etc.The', 'actress', 'playing', 'Laura', 'fair', 'job', 'not', 'terrible', 'did', 'open', 'mouth', 'too', 'much', 'made', 'seem', 'modern', 'ill-bred', 'dim-witted', 'also', 'lacked', 'Victorian', 'appearance', 'manners', 'real', 'Laura', 'adhered', 'can', 'forgive', 'actress', 'had', 'wrong', 'build', 'body', 'really', 'should', 'least', 'have', 'styled', 'hair', 'up', 'rather', 'loose', 'obviously', 'should', 'have', 'brown', 'not', 'blonde', 'hair', 'should', 'also', 'appear', 'bonnet', 'not', 'man', 'hat', 'However', 'could', 'look', 'details', 'others', 'are', 'harder', 'ignore..THE', 'WORST', 'one', 'character', 'are', 'playing', 'Laura', 'should', 'be', 'brunette', 'Mary', 'blonde', 'Ma', 'brunette', 'Pa', 'should', 'have', 'longer', 'hair', 'longer', 'beard', 'etc.', 'so', 'annoying', 'have', 'surviving', 'family', 'portraits', 'excuse', 'Caroline', 'Ingalls', 'would', 'never', 'openly', 'brusquely', 'defy', 'Charles', 'front', 'girls', 'was', 'always', 'gracious', 'often', 'silent', 'lady', 'Ma', 'also', 'loving', 'not', 'so', 'cold', 'bitter', 'depicted', 'movie', 'Also', 'showing', 'Pa', 'Ingalls', 'asking', 'Laura', 'work', 'money', 'help', 'pay', 'bills', 'was', 'also', 'big', 'no-no', 'Charles', 'never', 'did', 'Laura', 'was', 'happy', 'offer', 'work', 'help', 'family', 'own', 'accord', 'was', 'own', 'idea', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'inconvenience', 'Laura', 'was', 'always', 'proud', 'eager', 'help', 'folks', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Why', 'changed', 'other', 'details', 'such', 'how', 'Laura', 'Almanzo', 'met', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Also', 'sisters', 'are', 'merely', 'like', 'scenery', 'Only', 'Mary', 'few', 'meager', 'lines', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'suggest', 'Laura', 'would', 'ask', 'Almanzo', 'make', 'love', 'outdoors', 'took', 'quite', 'liberty', 'there', 'have', 'say', 'impertinence', 'suggestion', 'Laura', 'was', 'not', 'lady-like', 'Victorian', 'outraged', 'also', 'wearing', 'grey', 'dress', 'wedding', 'day', 'rather', 'black', 'one', '2', 'wedding', 'rings', 'etc', 'etc', 'could', 'endlessly', 'point', 'out', 'such', 'things', 'little', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pure', 'gold', 'LIW', 'fans', 'HAD', 'been', 'ACCURATE', 'Too', 'bad', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'did', 'however', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'right', 'settings', 'little', 'sweet', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'nice', 'made', 'up', 'romance', 'etc', 'especially', 'loved', 'Pa', 'also', 'lacked', 'Victorian', 'polish', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'So', 'folks', 'can', 'get', 'changes', 'sweet', 'harmless', 'movie', 'have', 'expectations', 'just', 'watch', 'schmaltzy', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'Little', 'House', '-ish', 'mostly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'IF', 'can', 'let', 'go', 'facts', 'Heck', 'even', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'very', 'wholesome', 'film', 'purists', 'will', 'probably', 'incite', 'riot']",N/A
