This movie is not Recommended for those seeking to learn about John's testimony about the book of Revelation. This solo play is best given to a Pastor who is teaching the book of John. Not recommended for family viewing more for worship leaders or Pastors. The words used in not a verbatim of the Gospel of John. The actor is a Disney Actor but the narration is not suitable for children. It would be deemed boring. Act 2 is better than Act 1 is more interactive and alive. It does have some humor in the dialogue. The best learning in this play is how John lived to be better not bitter despite the narrative of violent deaths of the Christians. This is a rare play that also talks about the freedom of the Christians from Roman persecution and how John was able to hear the goodnews that he can go back to Ephesus where he was buried. I highly recommend reading the Extra and testimony before appreciating the play. This is one play that is worth donating for a church library. Expect to know about Jesus life. Expect to learn about Peter and learn to stay faithful like John. Again this is for a highly informed .christian audience who have read the Gospels and appreciate plays.

The last surviving member of Jesus' twelve disciples, John remembers and relives the profound events of Jesus Christ's life which forever changed human history. A powerfully enacted, masterfully written, and utterly unforgettable presentation, St. John In Exile is a superbly produced and highly recommended addition to family, church school, seminary, and ecclesiastical studies video collections.",5,Relives the profound events of Jesus Christ's life,1056153600,"06 21, 2003",2003,677,"['tour-deforce', '92-minute', 'one-man', 'stage', 'production', 'starring', 'Dean', 'Jones', 'was', 'recorded', 'full', 'color', 'video', 'presented', 'Christian', 'community', 'Bridgestone', 'Multimedia', 'St.', 'John', 'Exile', 'extended', 'monologue', 'John', 'was', 'held', 'captive', 'Romans', 'last', 'surviving', 'member', 'Jesus', 'twelve', 'disciples', 'John', 'remembers', 'profound', 'events', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'life', 'forever', 'changed', 'human', 'history', 'powerfully', 'enacted', 'masterfully', 'written', 'utterly', 'unforgettable', 'presentation', 'St.', 'John', 'Exile', 'superbly', 'produced', 'highly', 'recommended', 'addition', 'family', 'church', 'school', 'seminary', 'ecclesiastical', 'studies', 'video', 'collections']",N/A

When I first bought this, I was expecting a movie based on the last days of the Apostle John and the making of the book of Revelation. What I got instead was much better.This film is a one man play where DJ takes on the role of the apostles and Jesus and re-enacts John's exile. In this play, DJ starts with the Apostle's work to bring Christianity to the workers at the island and then recounts the life of Jesus through the Apostles' eyes  that lead to this moment.There are times when you will cry with DJ, there are times where you will laugh, there are times you will exult with him in our Lord. I have rarely been as impressed with a one man performance as I was with this one.The music and production are a bit low quality, but you don't even notice it anymore after the first few minutes.

For those who only know Dean Jones from the Disney pictures (The Love Bug, Shaggy D.A., etc.) and such, here is a role for the actor that provides an opportunity for him to reveal both his tremendous dramatic talent and his deep Christian faith. Although some may say it is a little slow moving (perhaps because it is a recording of a stage performance at Jack Hayford's Church on the Way), the story is excellently written and has real depth. The production makes good use of various camera angles as well as creative lighting to add drama to the presentation. You find yourself quickly drawn into the story as Jones powerfully brings St. John to life, recounting, from his cell on the isle of Patmos, his journey with Jesus and the other disciples. A real tour de force performance by Jones (in the tradition of such one-man shows as Hal Holbrook's Mark Twain or James Whitmore's Harry Truman) makes this a DVD worth watching by anyone who appreciates a magnificent performance from an incredible actor and one that should definitely be in every Christian's collection.",5,"Magnificent performance from an incredible actor,",1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,1106,"['outstanding', 'production', 'who', 'only', 'know', 'Dean', 'Jones', 'Disney', 'pictures', 'Love', 'Bug', 'Shaggy', 'D.A.', 'etc', 'such', 'here', 'role', 'actor', 'opportunity', 'reveal', 'tremendous', 'dramatic', 'talent', 'deep', 'Christian', 'faith', 'may', 'say', 'little', 'slow', 'moving', 'perhaps', 'recording', 'stage', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Hayford', 'Church', 'Way', 'story', 'excellently', 'written', 'real', 'depth', 'production', 'good', 'use', 'various', 'camera', 'angles', 'as', 'well', 'creative', 'lighting', 'add', 'drama', 'presentation', 'find', 'quickly', 'drawn', 'story', 'Jones', 'powerfully', 'St.', 'John', 'life', 'recounting', 'cell', 'isle', 'Patmos', 'journey', 'Jesus', 'other', 'disciples', 'real', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'Jones', 'tradition', 'such', 'one-man', 'shows', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'Harry', 'Truman', 'DVD', 'worth', 'watching', 'anyone', 'who', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'incredible', 'actor', 'one', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'Christian', 'collection']",N/A
