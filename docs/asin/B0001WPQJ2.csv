Sadly, the group's last public appearance as ABBA was only a couple of years after this concert.  The disc has some interesting stuff about ABBA behind the scenes, like Bjorn running for exercise, and comments about the group dynamics.  Apparently, majority ruled in internal discussions.  (No mention of tie-breakers).  One con:  in the beginning of the dvd, you see ABBA briefly in performance; just as you're getting into it, they cut away for behind-the-scenes stuff.  However, the complete performances of each song are included in the bonus features.For the first time, I could clearly see why male audiences found Agnetha's bottom so fascinating, and that she knew it and played to it, constantly turning from side to side when singing some songs.  It's also easy to see why audiences loved Ani-Frid, a generous, giving performer, who poured her soul into her songs.

Remember it's a 25 year old DOCUMENTARY, not a concert, and it was shot by a network that didn't religiously archive the footage because nobody at the time expected people 25 years later to care! There's plenty of full length numbers, and they rip! Having been lucky enough to have seen ABBA at the Music Hall in Boston during this tour (as did most of Aerosmith, the Cars and the J. Giels Band down in the front rows), I'm delighted now to own this DVD because it proves a point I've long tried to make to my sceptical friends. ABBA WERE UNDENIABLY A GREAT, GREAT LIVE ACT.I've been professionally involved in the concert business for three decades, I've seen everyone pretty much, and though my personal tastes run more towards The Beatles, The Cramps and Garbage, I rank ABBA as one of the best live bands I've EVER seen on a stage. The vocals were spot on, the band rocked and were very tight, the energy level was through the roof. The group, especially Frida and Agnetha, were very lively, generous and vivacious with the audience, and the songs were just great. Frankly, it was an incredible, indescribable rush to see them live, especially if you'd waited five years for it.For ages ABBA have been a guilty pleasure for those of us supposedly hip rockers, but unless you're a frigid snob you'll have to admit upon viewing this show that ABBA weren't a corny plastic disco machine - they absolutely delivered the goods. A totally legitimate act with nothing to apologize for. What's also great is that ABBA were based not just on unforgettable hook-laden songs and astounding voices, but there was a genuinely warm and mature sexuality exuding from that stage. Agnetha and Frida were women, not little girls. There bodies may not have been perfect (J-LO fans, you'll see a startling similarity between she and Agnetha in a certain way) but their talent and their sensuality knocks Britney's lip synced teasing schoolgirl trip right off the stage. ABBA actually sang every note live, mistakes and all - what a concept.As to the extras, ""Thank You For The Music"" is probably my least favorite ABBA song, but on this disc Agnetha is just incredible, she nails it. Frida was the darker, more european side of things, handling more mature themes, and my fave, but if God ever put a more attractive woman on a stage than Agnetha in this film, I've never seen her. As to the sound complaints, if you run the disc through a good amplifier and speaker system there's no problem, if not some of the bottom is admittedly missing. But on the plus side the clarity of the vocals is astonishing, and within the instrumentation lots of little surprises I'd never heard.Visually it's incredible - you can count eyelashes and pores, and the color is rich and true. So c'mon - lighten up everyone - a very well directed documentary, a very well edited piece of history at a pretty low price. It's a great disc of a truly brilliant band. Let's be happy for a very nice little gift to us all.",5,Take it for what it is and enjoy it!,1090540800,"07 23, 2004",2004,3067,"['Hey', 'fellow', 'ABBA', 'fans', 'let', 'relax', 'little', 'bit', ""'re"", 'being', 'WAY', 'too', 'hard', 'DVD', 'Remember', '25', 'year', 'old', 'DOCUMENTARY', 'not', 'concert', 'was', 'shot', 'network', 'did', ""n't"", 'religiously', 'archive', 'footage', 'nobody', 'time', 'expected', 'people', '25', 'years', 'later', 'care', 'plenty', 'full', 'length', 'numbers', 'rip', 'Having', 'been', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'seen', 'ABBA', 'Music', 'Hall', 'Boston', 'tour', 'did', 'most', 'Aerosmith', 'Cars', 'J.', 'Giels', 'Band', 'down', 'front', ""'m"", 'delighted', 'now', 'own', 'DVD', 'point', ""'ve"", 'long', 'tried', 'make', 'sceptical', 'friends', 'ABBA', 'WERE', 'UNDENIABLY', 'A', 'GREAT', 'GREAT', 'LIVE', 'ACT.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'professionally', 'involved', 'concert', 'business', 'three', 'decades', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'everyone', 'pretty', 'much', 'personal', 'tastes', 'run', 'more', 'towards', 'Beatles', 'Cramps', 'Garbage', 'rank', 'ABBA', 'one', 'best', 'live', 'bands', ""'ve"", 'EVER', 'seen', 'stage', 'vocals', 'were', 'spot', 'band', 'rocked', 'were', 'very', 'tight', 'energy', 'level', 'was', 'roof', 'group', 'especially', 'Frida', 'Agnetha', 'were', 'very', 'lively', 'generous', 'vivacious', 'audience', 'songs', 'were', 'just', 'great', 'Frankly', 'was', 'incredible', 'indescribable', 'rush', 'see', 'live', 'especially', ""'d"", 'waited', 'five', 'years', 'it.For', 'ages', 'ABBA', 'have', 'been', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'supposedly', 'hip', 'rockers', ""'re"", 'frigid', 'snob', ""'ll"", 'have', 'admit', 'viewing', 'show', 'ABBA', 'were', ""n't"", 'corny', 'plastic', 'disco', 'machine', 'absolutely', 'delivered', 'goods', 'totally', 'legitimate', 'act', 'nothing', 'apologize', 'What', 'also', 'great', 'ABBA', 'were', 'based', 'not', 'just', 'unforgettable', 'hook-laden', 'songs', 'astounding', 'voices', 'there', 'was', 'genuinely', 'warm', 'mature', 'sexuality', 'exuding', 'stage', 'Agnetha', 'Frida', 'were', 'women', 'not', 'little', 'girls', 'bodies', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'J-LO', 'fans', ""'ll"", 'see', 'startling', 'similarity', 'Agnetha', 'certain', 'way', 'talent', 'sensuality', 'Britney', 'lip', 'synced', 'teasing', 'schoolgirl', 'trip', 'right', 'stage', 'ABBA', 'actually', 'sang', 'note', 'live', 'mistakes', 'what', 'concept.As', 'extras', 'Thank', 'Music', 'probably', 'least', 'favorite', 'ABBA', 'song', 'disc', 'Agnetha', 'just', 'incredible', 'Frida', 'was', 'darker', 'more', 'european', 'side', 'things', 'handling', 'more', 'mature', 'themes', 'fave', 'God', 'ever', 'put', 'more', 'attractive', 'woman', 'stage', 'Agnetha', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'sound', 'complaints', 'run', 'disc', 'good', 'amplifier', 'speaker', 'system', 'problem', 'not', 'bottom', 'admittedly', 'missing', 'plus', 'side', 'clarity', 'vocals', 'astonishing', 'instrumentation', 'lots', 'little', 'surprises', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard.Visually', 'incredible', 'can', 'count', 'eyelashes', 'pores', 'color', 'rich', 'true', 'So', ""c'mon"", 'lighten', 'up', 'everyone', 'very', 'well', 'directed', 'documentary', 'very', 'well', 'edited', 'piece', 'history', 'pretty', 'low', 'price', 'great', 'disc', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'band', 'Let', 'be', 'happy', 'very', 'nice', 'little', 'gift']",N/A

Glancing at some of the reviews for this disc by those who Knew (know) them, I expect that you and I can pretty well ignore them. W can't say that this is representative or unrepresentative ABBA, that this is much more commercial than .......whom we have not yet heard or better than.... whom we have not heard either. Taking it only from my viewpoint, this is an excellent introduction to their music. I don't have much use for the documentary form to find out about musicians but I did not find it obtrusive here. The music? I would say anyone who has heard the Boswell Sisters or the Rhythm Boys would have no trouble enjoying the sound ABBA produces.  No, I could not make out the lyrics most of the time, but they give me the feeling that with the right audio  equipment I might, that is to say, they convey the feeling that they want me to hear the lyrics and are enunciating for me. Just a feeling. I suppose I would label this ""middle of the road Rock"" but with no awareness of the range of what exists on both sides of the road.

It is more a life on the road with ABBA climaxing in ABBA's 5 days at Wembly, 1979.  It does have songs, some of which are performed whole and some are performed partially. Some of the references in the movie are a little obscure.  The fixation with high school football practice in the US (apparently the first image in the minds of ABBA when thinking about America is Friday Night Lights) and, also, when they, celebritorially, dunked the face of someone(I do not know who he was) into a cake (I missed the point). On the other hand, Summer Night City and the visual of a city's night-lit signs, as the car drove along the main drag, reflecteing off the car windshield was good. Also, football drills, juxataposed against Frida & Agneta doing vocal warm up drills was one football reference I did understand and like. Having said all that, I thought it was a fantastic movie, even with it's imperfections.  It is like joining the tour with the 2nd half of the show spotlighting songs on stage.  More songs in the special features, a slide show to the song ""Thank You for the Music,"" the trailer for the West End London Performance of Mama Mia, conversations with the tour promoter and the film director.  I think it is a good movie, worth the money, overall.

When you wait so long for anything new that is available from a group that split-up 22 years ago..ANYTHING is a blessing.This DVD though is a pretty poor. To be honest, they did not have much to work with. The original footage was designed for a limited television program and was edited very tightly. The sound on the DVD is pretty bad as well. I realize that it was a live concert, but the sound was better on the original TV produced version. All the new sound enhancement did was to make the sound extremely uneven and sounding like someone is turning the volume up and down at different intervals. I am surprised that this DVD was allowed to be sold because of the awful sound quality. With all the technology availabe today ... a MUCH better job could have been done than was shown in the end result. A person could have re-worked the original sound better on their home computer with very little expertise.The only plus to this DVD are the bonus tracks.

814949,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B0001WPQJ2,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[5, 6]","I would like to respond to the many reviewers who abruptly state their dissatisfaction with this DVD. I for one, would like to commend Universal for finally releasing this and showing us ABBA's on stage charm. This documentary was originally released in 1979 and there was a strict time limit which explains why most of the songs had to be edited. It is a shame though, since the 1979 tour consisted of over 20 songs but it's not Universal's fault so let's not take it out on them. The DVD does offer a few bonus track- ""The Way Old Friends Do"", ""I Have a Dream"" (uninterrupted version) and ""Thank You for for the Music"".I have seen several concerts in my time, live and via television and I must say ABBA is one of the better live bands. I can't state how aggravating and disappointing it is to listen to your favourite band sound like bad karaoke and butcher their songs live on stage. Energetic live performances does not excuse losing your voice mid-song or asking the audiences to sing while you eagerly hold out the microphone (because you are unable to reach that certain high note), or mime the words to a backing track. I find these annoying especially when I pay big buck to listen to the artist sing, not the audience or a play back recording. It's a trick used by several performers I have seen and fortunately ABBA never had to resort to that kind of concert trickery because the girls voices were great. It is true that ABBA did do a lot of lip syncing during several of their television appearances, for convenience sake, but thank goodness their actual concerts were live and the real thing. Agnetha's vocal's are great on ""Chiquitita"", ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" and ""Hole in Your Soul"" and her live rendition of ""Thank You for the Music"" (a bonus track here) is as good as the studio recording.Frida's ""I Have a Dream"" is also wonderful however the performance of ""Knowing Me Knowing You"" is edited to the extent that it does not offer enough content to fully review or enjoy the piece. Unfortunately some of the songs featured here are heavily edited or sampled (""Waterloo"", ""Take a Chance on Me"", ""Voulez-Vous"", ""Chiquitita"", ""Knowing Me Knowing You"") and more are complete (""I Have a Dream"", ""Summer Night City"", ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"", ""Dancing Queen"", ""Does Your Mother Know"", ""Hole in Your Soul"" and the bonus songs).Another of the DVD's highlights is the bonus track, ""The Way Old Friend's Do"" which was released as an album track in their 1980 studio album ""Super Trouper"" and it's a lovely song sung beautifully by the group. This version is different than the version included in the album.One minor issue I had is with ""Does Your Mother Know"". Although it is an energetic piece and the live version is exciting, with Bjorn and the girls running all over the stage, I would have preferred another track be showcased here, one sung by the girls who vocally were superior. Agnetha's solo number ""I'm Still Alive"", comes to mind, a rare recording which she only performed during this series of concerts and it is a shame it was not immortalized on this DVD.The band is also good and they do a great job in re-creating the music live. It's true that the music is different here than in their recordings. The sound is not as polished and is grittier sound more rock than traditional pop. The heavy drums & electric guitars give the songs a harder edge and is in sharp contrast (and a refreshing change) to the more glitzy studio recordings and quite frankly, there are some numbers that excel in this live format. For instance, ""Summer Night City"" was never a favorite track of mine but it is one of my favorites of the songs featured here. ABBA also performed this song live in 1981 during the Dick Cavett show and again, the song was performed with solid vocals and a grittier sound and again, it out-does the original studio version.ABBA's fans most likely already own this DVD, although incomplete, it gives us a unique glimpse of a live ABBA concert.

It's about time! Hopefully, they'll make it on the first try. After all, in record selling they rank up there with The Beatles, Elvis Pressly, Frank Sinatra and several other heavyweights. What more do they need? People obviously love them and their music. They've earned it.Abba had hit after hit on the world-wide scale but hardly left any imprint at all in the USA. I didn't even hear of them until about 1982 when I came home late one night and heard one of their songs playing on FM radio. The announcer said it was from their ""Greatest Hits"" album. I was very impressed by the song. ""Greatest Hits?"" Who are these guys? I bought the ""Greatest Hits"" album the next day. It was a really terrific album and every song was a winner. I was amazed! I remember telling a music friend about it, and he looked at me wondering if my taste was all in my mouth. That was a common reaction to Abba; They weren't taken seriously. They were kinda lumped in with the Bee Gees, Neil Diamond and the like as being very popular, but primarily among people who had no musical sophistication. Well, I think the play/movie ""Mamma Mia"" brought them back into public view and maybe their public perception began to change. I saw the movie/DVD and I enjoyed it very much and I'm enjoying the resurgence of Abba music enough to buy the ""Abba In Concert"" DVD.""Abba in Concert"" chronicles their 1979 tour of Europe and North America. It's an interesting look at the world-famous group and their world tour as it unfolded. I was reminded of ""Spinal Tap,"" but please don't take this in a negative way. The DVD documents bits of their road life and includes abundant footage of them in concerts and plays about a dozen of their live songs. Most of the songs I recognized, but some were totally new for me. The filming and sound were excellent and it was fun watching the act live, especially those two very beautiful women. I might add that I'd never seen the group, except in photos, and I was greatly impressed with their concert personas.It's hard for me to rate this DVD. I'd say it wasn't a particularly good documentary and I longed for something better, and it wasn't a very good concert film either. Many of the songs were incomplete. I  longed to see more of them and hear more of their songs. Yet, flaws and all, I loved watching this amazing group in action and the DVD was very entertaining. I suppose it's worth 4.5 stars, but since I can't give that evaluation, I'll round it up to five.

There isn't any degradation of the footage, amazing since this is from 1979. This DVD gives anybody an idea of the energy and talent ABBA brought to the table as artists. Bonus features include full versions of 'The Way Old Friends Do' and 'I Have A Dream'(same as the promo version) and a really good version of 'Thank You For The Music'(detailed as missing some footage but you can't really tell, all the lyrics are intact). There are a couple of interviews with the tour promoter and the producer of the film as well. You don't learn much but it provides good commentary on the project, and the band as well.The only criticism I have is that there are no interviews with anybody in the band, but that isn't surprising given their seclusive nature. Still this is a good buy for anybody who likes ABBA.As stated in the above review, it should be noted that this is NOT a complete concert and some songs are heavily edited. Somewhat disappointing considering ABBA's live set consisted of  25 songs during this tour. This was originally a television special over in Sweden in the first place and reminds me of an early version of 'Depeche Mode 101' in as far as following the band around in the early segments, interviewing a few fans and edited songs.

814958,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0001WPQJ2,Kevin Killian,"[4, 7]","What's the best thing about this video?  The big choral number ""I Have a Dream"" joined by what looks like eighty children at Wembley Stadium.  Did ABBA find new children in every city in the 1979 tour and train them each briefly on the afternoon of the show?  I don't think ""I have a Dream"" is a very easy number for kids to sing, with that long, held note on ""I belieeeeeeve,"" and yet these kids sail into it like pros.  I wonder if any of the 1979 kids grew up and became pop stars themselves?  The ones you see on the documentary all look as though spotlights are second nature to them; in the light they seem to grow into ttheir full selves and find a brief happiness before being led off into the shadows of backstage.  I wonder if a new documentary, rounding up these kids 30 years later, like that ""7 Up"" Michael Apted series tracing London schoolchildren into their teens and beyond, could be commissioned by the BBC so that finally we could see what happened to the little angels.  I wonder if they were orphans or maybe just professional child actors from some RADA of childhood.  Anyway that's one of my great highlights from ABBA IN CONCERT, which must have been filmed, in my estimation, just as ""Gimmie!  Gimmie!  Gimmie!  (A Man after Midnight)"" had been released as a single, and ABBA was in the process of seeking a harder, rockier sound.Which really shows up in the best numbers here, among them the fiery, eclectically scored SUMMER NIGHT CITY, and perhaps only a little less successfully, HOLE IN YOUR SOUL, which borrows from old school 50s US a cappella groups and the big ""Philles"" sound of Phil Specter and Jack Nietzsche to create a mobius strip of sound, in which big bursts of guitar alternate with an eerie blast of silence, then the angelic voices of Agnetha and Frida rising to a shout.  It's at this period that people were really looking at ABBA and asking themselves, are they the strange ones, or are we?  Bjorn and Benny seem to be in constant control of their women, and yet they seem helpless, nearly stupefied, inn the face of so much sex appeal, like the sailors on brave Ulysses' crew, urged to stuff their ears with wax so that they wouldn't hear the sirens' song.",4,Hole in Your Soul,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,2205,"['What', 'best', 'thing', 'video', 'big', 'choral', 'number', 'Have', 'Dream', 'joined', 'what', 'eighty', 'children', 'Wembley', 'Stadium', 'Did', 'ABBA', 'find', 'new', 'children', 'city', '1979', 'tour', 'train', 'briefly', 'afternoon', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'Dream', 'very', 'easy', 'number', 'kids', 'sing', 'long', 'held', 'note', 'belieeeeeeve', 'yet', 'kids', 'sail', 'pros', 'wonder', '1979', 'kids', 'grew', 'up', 'became', 'pop', 'stars', 'ones', 'see', 'documentary', 'look', 'spotlights', 'are', 'second', 'nature', 'light', 'seem', 'grow', 'ttheir', 'full', 'selves', 'find', 'brief', 'happiness', 'being', 'led', 'off', 'shadows', 'backstage', 'wonder', 'new', 'documentary', 'rounding', 'up', 'kids', '30', 'years', 'later', '7', 'Up', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'series', 'tracing', 'London', 'schoolchildren', 'teens', 'could', 'be', 'commissioned', 'BBC', 'finally', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'little', 'angels', 'wonder', 'were', 'orphans', 'maybe', 'just', 'professional', 'child', 'actors', 'RADA', 'childhood', 'Anyway', 'one', 'great', 'highlights', 'ABBA', 'IN', 'CONCERT', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'estimation', 'just', 'Gimmie', 'Gimmie', 'Gimmie', 'Man', 'Midnight', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'single', 'ABBA', 'was', 'process', 'seeking', 'harder', 'rockier', 'sound.Which', 'really', 'up', 'best', 'numbers', 'here', 'fiery', 'eclectically', 'scored', 'SUMMER', 'NIGHT', 'CITY', 'perhaps', 'only', 'little', 'less', 'successfully', 'HOLE', 'IN', 'YOUR', 'SOUL', 'old', 'school', '50s', 'cappella', 'groups', 'big', 'Philles', 'sound', 'Phil', 'Specter', 'Jack', 'Nietzsche', 'create', 'mobius', 'strip', 'sound', 'big', 'bursts', 'guitar', 'alternate', 'eerie', 'blast', 'silence', 'then', 'angelic', 'voices', 'Agnetha', 'Frida', 'rising', 'shout', 'period', 'people', 'were', 'really', 'looking', 'ABBA', 'asking', 'are', 'strange', 'ones', 'are', 'Bjorn', 'Benny', 'seem', 'be', 'constant', 'control', 'women', 'yet', 'seem', 'helpless', 'nearly', 'stupefied', 'face', 'so', 'much', 'sex', 'appeal', 'sailors', 'brave', 'Ulysses', 'crew', 'urged', 'stuff', 'ears', 'wax', 'so', 'would', ""n't"", 'hear', 'sirens', 'song']",N/A

However, remember that this is over twenty-five years ago and the quality of the picture; the camera work and the sound (God forbid) are not anything like they are now.  It is fun to see ABBA camp it up on stage and the vocals (although tough to hear) are actually excellent.  The outfits are a riot and only Benny seems to survive the 'big butt syndrome' by hiding behind the keyboards.  No more tight outfits, please.  The first few songs are not complete in entirety and there is quite a bit of editing for on-the-scenes- commentary about the excitement of doing their first tour.  Eventually there are some full-length songs.  It seems as if this was a documentary filmed for television in the format it is edited, so be prepared.  This is not like a ""Bee Gees-One Night Only"" concert or an ""Eagles Farewell"" tour that goes from song to song without interruption.

With all their worldwide success, 8 albums, and songs that are being covered & re-covered by new artists 30 years later, it's hard to believe the cultural colossus known as ABBA only toured twice. There was the Australia tour captured in ""ABBA the Movie"" and the North American/European tour in this, ""ABBA in Concert"".Only intended to be a 55-min TV special produced by a reluctant Swedish channel, ""ABBA in Concert"" may leave you wanting more songs, but what it delivers is powerful and authentic. Speaking as an amateur sound engineer and even amateurer film editor, I can say that that the production is remarkably tight & energetic, without any cheap filler like lengthy crowd scenes over the music, or re-using footage from different songs to fill in the gaps (which almost every other concert video of the 70s-80s did, due to the expense of having multiple cameras).""ABBA in Concert"" (the concert footage portion) was filmed over the course of 2 nights at Wembley, using 5 cameras each time. One stage camera was supposedly operated by a guy ON ROLLERSKATES. Too cool. The result is plenty of clear shots of each band member with both closeup intimate angles as well as powerful wide angles.Although this was their first and only tour of the USA, unfortunately no USA shows were used. I can only guess, from the description in their liner notes, that ABBA was not as wildly received in some of the American venues which were smaller. Instead of concert footage we get 15-20 minutes of road footage which is interesting because we get to ""travel"" with the band. However it lacks the intensity of the road/hotel footage on the Australian ""ABBA the Movie"" which was at times frightening with the number of crazed fans. Suddenly & inexplicably we switch from USA road footage to the Wembley concert (without any establishing shots of London or the British fans).But once the concert begins, it's like an unrelenting freight train picking up momentum until its spectacular end (the last 3 songs in particular had me rockin on the sofa, much to my dog's confusion). As you're watching you realize, despite their lack of touring experience, Agnetha, Bjorn, Benny & Frida were superstars in every sense. Professional, practiced, polished and totally pumped with energy, they put on a show every bit as dazzling as you'd hope. I've been going to concerts since the late 80s, and aside from a Van Halen show where David Lee Roth was climbing the rafters of the stadium while the bassist was log rolling down the stage, this has got to be one of the most energetic shows I can think of, and I'm kicking myself for missing it. But at least we have this DVD.The setlist is, in this order,1 Waterloo2 Eagle3 Take A Chance On Me4 Voulez-Vous5 Chiquitita6 I Have A Dream7 Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!

Unfortunately, the editing is terrible :-(Apparently, there was some obsession with roller-skating going on during the editing of this film, which detracts from a wonderful concert that I wish I could have seen live. The back-stage stuff and preparations prior to arrival at Wembley are fine, but what's all this cutting into songs with clips of people roller- skating?However, the most unforgivable edit of all - a true abomination - is the hacking up of ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" into a one verse song with of course more roller-skating. The story is that there was not enough suitable film of that song to last the entire audio, so they they just mangled it to death. This is a lame excuse on the part of these editors because years later a guy found the complete audio and found enough video to run it with the audio. Sure, some of the video was from another song and some was repeated, but: the end result is the complete song as it was heard in the concert.So if the guy who published the complete song on YouTube could do it, why couldn't the editors of this DVD do it? This cheezy editing really goes against everything that ABBA did in their live shows. Because they were basically a studio band they were meticulous about their live performances and they pulled it off. Their live shows sounded just as good - if not better - as their studio work.This DVD is the only game in town if you want a live concert by ABBA - even though the DVD editing is a huge disappointment - so I still recommend buying it.",3,Great Concert with Disappointing Editing,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,1614,"['Considering', 'concert', 'was', 'done', '1979', 'sound', 'quality', 'cinematography', 'are', 'excellent', 'Unfortunately', 'editing', 'terrible', 'Apparently', 'was', 'obsession', 'roller-skating', 'going', 'editing', 'film', 'wonderful', 'concert', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'back-stage', 'stuff', 'preparations', 'prior', 'arrival', 'Wembley', 'are', 'fine', 'what', 'cutting', 'songs', 'clips', 'people', 'roller-', 'skating', 'However', 'most', 'unforgivable', 'edit', 'true', 'abomination', 'hacking', 'Knowing', 'Me', 'Knowing', 'one', 'verse', 'song', 'course', 'more', 'roller-skating', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'suitable', 'film', 'song', 'last', 'entire', 'audio', 'just', 'mangled', 'death', 'lame', 'excuse', 'part', 'editors', 'years', 'later', 'guy', 'found', 'complete', 'audio', 'found', 'enough', 'video', 'run', 'audio', 'Sure', 'video', 'was', 'song', 'was', 'repeated', 'end', 'result', 'complete', 'song', 'was', 'heard', 'concert.So', 'guy', 'who', 'published', 'complete', 'song', 'YouTube', 'could', 'do', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'editors', 'DVD', 'do', 'cheezy', 'editing', 'really', 'everything', 'ABBA', 'did', 'live', 'shows', 'were', 'basically', 'studio', 'band', 'were', 'meticulous', 'live', 'performances', 'pulled', 'off', 'live', 'shows', 'sounded', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'studio', 'work.This', 'DVD', 'only', 'game', 'town', 'want', 'live', 'concert', 'ABBA', 'even', 'DVD', 'editing', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'so', 'still', 'recommend', 'buying']",N/A

A lot of footage showing the members preparing, rehearsing etc are shown. If only more songs had been recorded it would only have satisfied more discerning ABBA fans like me. ABBA is truly a great live act. They sold out Wembley on consecutive nights, something that even seasoned rock acts weren't capable of. I don't listen (or watch them) like I do with other bands but they have certainly stood the test of time as their fan base keeps growing even to this very day.When I started listening to pop and rock in the early 80's ABBA was my favorite. Only The Beegees could make a better impression. The other band was Boney M that I stopped listening to in those early years but Lonely Planet, the travel authority mentions that Boney M is still played in pubs in some south-east asian countries.

814969,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B0001WPQJ2,William,"[10, 11]","I consider myself one of ABBA's biggest fans, since 1975.  Australia put ABBA on the map when in that year (1975), our TV rock show ""Countdown"" gave considerable exposure to the video clips ""SOS"" and ""MamaMia"", before any other country had noticed them.  The latter went on to be a huge No. 1 hit and ABBAmania took over Australia.  This is a significant point, because in 1977 they toured Australia and Swedish film-makers followed to capture the concert and turn it into a movie titled ""ABBA: The Movie"".  The film featured stunning concert performances of early ABBA material and their then new album ""Arrival"".  In between this concert footage was a storyline about an Australian journalist desperate to secure an interview with the four super Swedes, which sees him following them all around Australia until he gets his wish.  This movie, in my opinion, is the best way to capture the concert atomosphere of ABBA.  The problem is, this movie is still unavailable on DVD.  I am not even sure if it was released to the American public, but it was a No. 1 box office smash in Australia and Europe in 1978.Now, on to this new DVD release : ABBA in Concert.  I read many negative reviews of this DVD, but as a true ABBA fan, wanted to make up my own mind, so purchased the DVD.  This DVD is basically a documentary from 1979 featuring ABBA's tour of America and UK.  Much of it has been seen before on American TV (apparently).  The American concert footage is brief and consists more of backstage stuff and sightseeing trips.  The UK footage is better because you get more concert footage even, although some songs are noticeably edited (eg. Chiquitita).  This is because the documentary was originally made for TV and had time limitations. The total amount of songs listed is 12.  To me, the best part of this DVD is the inclusion of ""The Way Old Friends Do"", previously unseen in Europe, Australia and America.  This is part of the bonus material on the DVD, and is worth the high price tag of the DVD alone.  Other bonus features include interviews with the documentary producer ... but this did not appeal to me.  There is also edited footage of ""Thank YOu for the Music"" which is interesting because much of the concert footage for this track remains missing, so the DVD producers have done some splicing etc to give a complete finish to the song.  It has been well done in my opinion, and you cannot tell that footage is missing.Overall, the DVD overall is disappointing in my opinion.  It left me wanting more, and it is too expensive for what you get.  I urge American fans to purchase the VHS of ""ABBA: The Movie"" (until it's released on DVD). It's the best way to see incredible concert footage of this band.  Plus you will experience the impact that ABBA had on Australia back in 1977 when it was filmed.
