1683467,A156PASM83DS8J,B00H47IWXY,Ken Castillo,"[1, 1]","So far I've been on a roll with purchasing The Asylum flims, one release after the other. I've been a big fan of theirs for a while now and now with one of their latest releases, Apocalypse Pompeii, serves as a testament to their consistency. Well.... their movies are really hit or miss for those of you that aren't fans of The Asylum flicks but for those of you that like the B rated movie cheesiness, impossible odds and some good laughs, then this is the flick for you. Sure, there are billions of disaster movies out there and they're all different in story and in budget. However, all disaster movies use the same formula. Apocalypse Pompeii also has a surprisingly good supporting cast with that of John Rhys-Davies and Adrian Paul!!! Truthfully, without any monsters or space ships, this movie took a while for me to warm up to but in the end I still enjoyed it. Not one of the best movies to come out of The Asylum studios but it's good to watch on a day where you don't want to leave the house.",3,It took a while to warm up to but it was a good surprise,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,1004,"['So', 'far', ""'ve"", 'been', 'roll', 'purchasing', 'Asylum', 'flims', 'one', 'release', 'other', ""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'theirs', 'while', 'now', 'now', 'one', 'latest', 'releases', 'Apocalypse', 'Pompeii', 'testament', 'consistency', 'Well', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'hit', 'miss', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'Asylum', 'flicks', 'B', 'rated', 'movie', 'cheesiness', 'impossible', 'odds', 'good', 'laughs', 'then', 'flick', 'Sure', 'are', 'billions', 'disaster', 'movies', 'there', ""'re"", 'different', 'story', 'budget', 'However', 'disaster', 'movies', 'use', 'same', 'formula', 'Apocalypse', 'Pompeii', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'Truthfully', 'monsters', 'space', 'ships', 'movie', 'took', 'while', 'warm', 'up', 'end', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'Not', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'come', 'Asylum', 'studios', 'good', 'watch', 'day', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'house']",Apocalypse Pompeii

1683469,A3HKMOD2C33PN0,B00H47IWXY,Mark Allan Schuring,"[1, 1]","The two things that struck me about the movie initially, were the cinematography and the special effects. Both were good and I settled in for a good experience. The cinematography remained respectable but the special effects plummeted in, well, effectiveness. The only thing I could conclude is that the opening effects may have been actual footage of volcanic action which ran out before long. The story line was plausible but strained my imagination at times. Such as, why gather a rescue team of commandos armed to the teeth for a volcanic explosion. I think I expected more than the movie could produce.",3,A bit disappointed,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,607,"['two', 'things', 'struck', 'movie', 'initially', 'were', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'settled', 'good', 'experience', 'cinematography', 'remained', 'respectable', 'special', 'effects', 'plummeted', 'well', 'effectiveness', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'conclude', 'opening', 'effects', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'actual', 'footage', 'volcanic', 'action', 'ran', 'out', 'long', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'plausible', 'strained', 'imagination', 'times', 'Such', 'why', 'gather', 'rescue', 'team', 'commandos', 'armed', 'teeth', 'volcanic', 'explosion', 'think', 'expected', 'more', 'movie', 'could', 'produce']",Apocalypse Pompeii

1683472,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00H47IWXY,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","This film is a mock buster that has nothing to do with another film recently released that has &#34;Pompeii&#34; in its title. Asylum did something similar with the &#34;Three Musketeers&#34; a few years back, making a movie with a similar name, but in a different time period.This film follows the same identical plot as all of Asylum disaster films. Family separates. Disaster strikes. Super Dad (Adrian Paul) rescues family. In this film the teen daughter (Georgina Beedle) turns into Bill Nye the science guy to save everyone from a volcano. The acting was Asylum grade.The film answers the question:  If 100 monkeys were placed at 100 type writers, could they eventually come up with an Asylum script?The film is overly CG. The early question I have was why did the opening scene contain a view of Rio and then have volcanoes go off somewhere else? The cross at Rio is the most recognized landmark in the world. Then we have John Rhys-Davies as Colonel Dillard, except he is now Carlos Dillard as opposed to Colonel Ralph Dillard from &#34;100 Degrees Below Zero&#34; when Europe was destroyed. Who would notice?3 star cheese film. Not as cheesy as &#34;100 Degrees Below Zero&#34; but it tries.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",3,BREAK OUT THE MORPHINE,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,1243,"['film', 'mock', 'buster', 'nothing', 'do', 'film', 'recently', 'released', '34', 'Pompeii', '34', 'title', 'Asylum', 'did', 'something', 'similar', '34', 'Three', 'Musketeers', '34', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'making', 'movie', 'similar', 'name', 'different', 'time', 'period.This', 'film', 'same', 'identical', 'plot', 'Asylum', 'disaster', 'films', 'Family', 'Disaster', 'strikes', 'Super', 'Dad', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'family', 'film', 'teen', 'daughter', 'Georgina', 'Beedle', 'Bill', 'Nye', 'science', 'guy', 'save', 'everyone', 'volcano', 'acting', 'was', 'Asylum', 'grade.The', 'film', 'question', '100', 'monkeys', 'were', 'placed', '100', 'type', 'writers', 'could', 'eventually', 'come', 'up', 'Asylum', 'script', 'film', 'overly', 'CG', 'early', 'question', 'have', 'was', 'why', 'did', 'opening', 'scene', 'contain', 'view', 'Rio', 'then', 'have', 'volcanoes', 'go', 'off', 'somewhere', 'else', 'cross', 'Rio', 'most', 'recognized', 'landmark', 'world', 'Then', 'have', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'Colonel', 'Dillard', 'now', 'Carlos', 'Dillard', 'opposed', 'Colonel', 'Ralph', 'Dillard', '34', '100', 'Degrees', 'Zero', '34', 'when', 'Europe', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Who', 'would', 'notice', '3', 'star', 'cheese', 'film', 'Not', 'as', 'cheesy', '34', '100', 'Degrees', 'Zero', '34', 'tries.Parental', 'Guide', 'f-bombs', 'sex', 'nudity']",Apocalypse Pompeii
