1553014,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B008H1Q3QY,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 5]","This French ""romcom"" starring the enchanting Audrey Tautou, is an exercise in flimsy whimsy. Tautou plays, Nathalie, a young woman deeply in love with her husband who is inconveniently hit by a car when out jogging. The widowed Nathalie throws herself into work (we see her behind a desk dealing with stuff, heading a team of males and fending off the unwelcome advances of her boss -- but we never find out what all these people actually do. It's something connected to Sweden but what exactly we don't know.)One day, she impulsively kisses Markus, one of her subordinates, a rather lumpy,  bald, Swede with perfect French played by Francois Damiens. He evidently views Nathalie as way out of his league -- and so do her friends and her boss. It's never explained exactly what his attraction is and why she felt impelled to passionately embrace him. But he's a fundamentally decent sort and he grows on us, the audience, as their relationship begins to blossom.This souffl&eacute; of a movie never really gets to grips with any strong emotion. Tautou is adorable (isn't she always?) but we don't really feel her grief or her love. She remains an enigma, defined by others. The final scene has Markus imagining Nathalie at different points in her life wandering through her grandmother's garden. We're invited to believe that yet another version of Nathalie is about to emerge.",3,Pleasant - but flimsy,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,1377,"['French', 'romcom', 'starring', 'enchanting', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'exercise', 'flimsy', 'whimsy', 'Tautou', 'Nathalie', 'young', 'woman', 'deeply', 'love', 'husband', 'who', 'inconveniently', 'hit', 'car', 'when', 'out', 'jogging', 'widowed', 'Nathalie', 'work', 'see', 'desk', 'dealing', 'stuff', 'heading', 'team', 'males', 'fending', 'off', 'unwelcome', 'advances', 'boss', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'people', 'actually', 'do', 'something', 'connected', 'Sweden', 'what', 'exactly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'One', 'day', 'impulsively', 'Markus', 'one', 'subordinates', 'rather', 'lumpy', 'bald', 'Swede', 'perfect', 'French', 'played', 'Francois', 'Damiens', 'evidently', 'Nathalie', 'way', 'league', 'so', 'do', 'friends', 'boss', 'never', 'explained', 'exactly', 'what', 'attraction', 'why', 'felt', 'impelled', 'passionately', 'embrace', 'fundamentally', 'decent', 'sort', 'audience', 'relationship', 'blossom.This', 'souffl', 'eacute', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'grips', 'strong', 'emotion', 'Tautou', 'adorable', ""n't"", 'always', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'grief', 'love', 'enigma', 'defined', 'others', 'final', 'scene', 'Markus', 'imagining', 'Nathalie', 'different', 'points', 'life', 'wandering', 'grandmother', 'garden', ""'re"", 'invited', 'believe', 'yet', 'version', 'Nathalie', 'emerge']",N/A

1553016,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B008H1Q3QY,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[2, 2]","Delicacy is a charming romantic movie. Audrey Tautou is beautiful as an intelligent confident woman.Delicacy opens with a young man sitting in a cafe in Paris. A beautiful woman walks in and we hear the voice over narration of his thoughts. He wants to talk to her, but no he shouldn't. He day dreams about what she will order. Some might say in typical French style, he debates with himself over what she will order. He decides, if she orders this, he will talk to her. It turns out to be a very romantic magic moment in the film.This film deserves to be watched without knowing much more of the plot. There are some wonderful and some not so wonderful surprises along the way. All are worth discovering without spoilers. I will try not to spoil any of those moments.The title is a bit deceptive; it is not about food or some rare food. Instead it is about treating people in a kind delicate manner, with love and affection. The scenes in Paris are gorgeous. This is not tourist land Paris (well there are a few scenes with the Eifel Tour in the background), but more the places where people work and live. The scenes in the country are equally beautiful. The country scenes were shot North West of Paris, just in the country outside of suburbia, near Cergy at Montgeroult - Courcelles, Montgeroult, France.Audrey Tautou's (Amelie) movie roles up to this point have been a bit on the quirky crazy side. In this film, she leaves all that behind and is a very normal intelligent woman, Nathalie. I like her in this film the best. Francois, played by Pio Marmai, is handsome, care free, and the perfect leading man. The other romantic interest, Markus, played by Francois Damiens, is the most unlikely person ever to be paired with Nathalie. Bruno Todeshini does an excellent job as the creepy inappropriate boss, Charles. The supporting cast is strong, especially Nathalie's friends and relatives.The real stars of this film are behind the scenes, the Foenkinos brothers, David and Stephane. David wrote the novel this film is based on, and then turned around and wrote the screenplay. He is also credited with codirecting the film with his brother. It is remarkable that anybody this close to the story could have made such a wonderful film. The camera work, the pacing, the lighting, and the sound, were outstanding.The film is almost two hours long (108 minutes). There were a few moments where the editing could have been a bit tighter, maybe 10 minutes less would have been better.The soundtrack is beautiful. Most of the songs were written and performed by Emilie Simon. Simon has a quirky strange voice that is a nice contrast to the film. The samples here are well worth a listen,Franky Knight.The film is rated PG-13. There is no nudity. There is a little bit of strong language in the subtitles. There are a few bedroom scenes, but it isn't clear that anybody is making love. Overall, this is an honest PG-13 film that 13 year olds could easily watch; the directors did not push the rating envelope. The film is presented in French with English subtitles.The DVD includes two featurettes, an interview with Audrey Tautou, and a making of. The French seem to know exactly how to make these bonus features. They manage to extend the film, develop a deeper understanding of what happened and why. After watching the film, I enjoyed both shorts.The film is about relationships, and finding love. It is also about details and a man paying close attention to the woman he loves then doing those small things that are ultimately incredibly easy to do but mean so much. It is the small gesture.",5,The Small Gesture,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,3595,"['Delicacy', 'charming', 'romantic', 'movie', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'confident', 'woman.Delicacy', 'young', 'man', 'sitting', 'cafe', 'Paris', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'walks', 'hear', 'voice', 'narration', 'thoughts', 'talk', 'should', ""n't"", 'day', 'what', 'will', 'order', 'might', 'say', 'typical', 'French', 'style', 'what', 'will', 'order', 'orders', 'will', 'talk', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'romantic', 'magic', 'moment', 'film.This', 'film', 'deserves', 'be', 'watched', 'knowing', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'are', 'wonderful', 'not', 'so', 'wonderful', 'surprises', 'way', 'are', 'worth', 'discovering', 'spoilers', 'will', 'try', 'not', 'spoil', 'moments.The', 'title', 'bit', 'deceptive', 'not', 'food', 'rare', 'food', 'Instead', 'treating', 'people', 'kind', 'delicate', 'manner', 'love', 'affection', 'scenes', 'Paris', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'not', 'tourist', 'land', 'Paris', 'well', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'Eifel', 'Tour', 'background', 'more', 'places', 'where', 'people', 'work', 'live', 'scenes', 'country', 'are', 'equally', 'beautiful', 'country', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'North', 'West', 'Paris', 'just', 'country', 'suburbia', 'Cergy', 'Montgeroult', 'Courcelles', 'Montgeroult', 'France.Audrey', 'Tautou', 'Amelie', 'movie', 'up', 'point', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'quirky', 'crazy', 'side', 'film', 'behind', 'very', 'normal', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'Nathalie', 'film', 'best', 'Francois', 'played', 'Pio', 'Marmai', 'handsome', 'care', 'free', 'perfect', 'leading', 'man', 'other', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Markus', 'played', 'Francois', 'Damiens', 'most', 'unlikely', 'person', 'ever', 'be', 'paired', 'Nathalie', 'Bruno', 'Todeshini', 'excellent', 'job', 'creepy', 'inappropriate', 'boss', 'Charles', 'supporting', 'cast', 'strong', 'especially', 'Nathalie', 'friends', 'relatives.The', 'real', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'Foenkinos', 'brothers', 'David', 'Stephane', 'David', 'wrote', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'then', 'turned', 'around', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'also', 'credited', 'codirecting', 'film', 'brother', 'remarkable', 'anybody', 'close', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'wonderful', 'film', 'camera', 'work', 'pacing', 'lighting', 'sound', 'were', 'outstanding.The', 'film', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'long', '108', 'minutes', 'were', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'tighter', 'maybe', '10', 'minutes', 'less', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better.The', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'Most', 'songs', 'were', 'written', 'performed', 'Emilie', 'Simon', 'Simon', 'quirky', 'strange', 'voice', 'nice', 'contrast', 'film', 'samples', 'here', 'are', 'well', 'listen', 'Franky', 'Knight.The', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'nudity', 'little', 'bit', 'strong', 'language', 'subtitles', 'are', 'few', 'bedroom', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'clear', 'anybody', 'making', 'love', 'Overall', 'honest', 'PG-13', 'film', '13', 'year', 'olds', 'could', 'easily', 'watch', 'directors', 'did', 'not', 'push', 'rating', 'envelope', 'film', 'presented', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'featurettes', 'interview', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'making', 'French', 'seem', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'make', 'bonus', 'features', 'manage', 'extend', 'film', 'develop', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'watching', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'shorts.The', 'film', 'relationships', 'finding', 'love', 'also', 'about', 'details', 'man', 'paying', 'close', 'attention', 'woman', 'then', 'doing', 'small', 'things', 'are', 'ultimately', 'incredibly', 'easy', 'do', 'mean', 'so', 'much', 'small', 'gesture']",N/A
1553017,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B008H1Q3QY,D. Hartley,"[8, 10]","""I could go on holiday in your hair,"" moons a love struck Swede named Markus (Francois Damiens) to his co-worker, a beautiful French widow named Nathalie. If that sounds like an inappropriate comment to make at the office (to your boss, no less), you're right. Then again, it's not every day that your boss (bearing a remarkable likeness to Audrey Tautou) calls you into her office, springs from her chair without warning, plants a lingering, passionate smooch, then goes back to her desk as if nothing just happened. It's an anomaly that a slovenly nebbish like Markus is going to require a few days to process.Whether or not you believe that a beautiful young widow who bears a remarkable likeness to Audrey Tautou would even consider throwing herself at a slovenly nebbish who bears a remarkable likeness to a French Chris Elliot is probably a good litmus test for whether or not you will be willing to sit through a romantic dramedy called ""Delicacy"", directed by siblings David and Stephane Foenkinos (adapted from David's novel). In an opening montage that vibes the films of Eric Rohmer, we get a recap of Nathalie's relationship with her late husband, the suavely continental Francois (Pio Marmai), from their initial Meet Cute at a quaint caf&eacute;, to his untimely demise while out for a jog one fateful morning. The heartbroken Nathalie deals with her pain by becoming a workaholic.And so it is that Nathalie registers just as much shock at her impulsive amorous advance on her own underling, as does Markus himself (who leaves her office dazed and confused). When he later screws up the courage to ask her if she truly wants to go down this road, Nathalie tries to backpedal. She doesn't know what possessed her. Her mind was elsewhere, etc. etc. ""You sound like an American. That's a bad sign,"" Markus deadpans, in the film's funniest line. This gets a chuckle out of Nathalie, breaking the ice.Will this odd couple find true love? You'll have to watch to find out. You will have to be willing to suspend your disbelief, of course. Your willingness to go along with this fluffy but diverting affair also hinges on which camp you happen to be in regarding Ms. Tautou's saucer-eyed, Gallic pixie allure (which some are apparently immune to). There is some unevenness in tone, particularly stemming from an over-reliance on the gimmick of ""listening in"" to each character's Deep Thoughts (which aim for poetic heights but tend to crash-land just this side of a Hallmark greeting card), but it's not enough to sink the proceedings. The film is saved by Tautou and Damiens' onscreen chemistry; they both bring an endearing charm to their roles. Damiens imbues his shambling ugly duckling with a gentle humanity that helps us grok what Nathalie finds so appealing. Think of this film as a souffl&eacute;, which, depending on what you bring to the table, can be an entree or a dessert. If you're the type who could bypass the entree and go straight to dessert, I think you will enjoy. Those without a sweet tooth will probably want to skip it.",3,Love souffle,1343174400,"07 25, 2012",2012,3051,"['could', 'go', 'holiday', 'hair', 'love', 'struck', 'Swede', 'named', 'Markus', 'Francois', 'Damiens', 'co-worker', 'beautiful', 'French', 'widow', 'named', 'Nathalie', 'inappropriate', 'comment', 'make', 'office', 'boss', 'less', ""'re"", 'right', 'Then', 'again', 'not', 'day', 'boss', 'bearing', 'remarkable', 'likeness', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'office', 'springs', 'chair', 'warning', 'plants', 'lingering', 'passionate', 'smooch', 'then', 'back', 'desk', 'nothing', 'just', 'happened', 'anomaly', 'slovenly', 'nebbish', 'Markus', 'going', 'require', 'few', 'days', 'process.Whether', 'not', 'believe', 'beautiful', 'young', 'widow', 'who', 'remarkable', 'likeness', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'would', 'even', 'consider', 'throwing', 'slovenly', 'nebbish', 'who', 'remarkable', 'likeness', 'French', 'Chris', 'Elliot', 'probably', 'good', 'litmus', 'test', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'willing', 'sit', 'romantic', 'dramedy', 'called', 'Delicacy', 'directed', 'siblings', 'David', 'Stephane', 'Foenkinos', 'adapted', 'David', 'novel', 'opening', 'montage', 'films', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'get', 'recap', 'Nathalie', 'relationship', 'late', 'husband', 'suavely', 'continental', 'Francois', 'Pio', 'Marmai', 'initial', 'Meet', 'Cute', 'quaint', 'caf', 'eacute', 'untimely', 'demise', 'out', 'jog', 'one', 'fateful', 'morning', 'heartbroken', 'Nathalie', 'deals', 'pain', 'becoming', 'workaholic.And', 'Nathalie', 'registers', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'shock', 'impulsive', 'amorous', 'advance', 'own', 'underling', 'Markus', 'who', 'office', 'dazed', 'confused', 'When', 'later', 'up', 'courage', 'ask', 'truly', 'go', 'down', 'road', 'Nathalie', 'backpedal', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'possessed', 'mind', 'was', 'elsewhere', 'etc', 'etc', 'sound', 'American', 'bad', 'sign', 'Markus', 'deadpans', 'film', 'funniest', 'line', 'chuckle', 'Nathalie', 'breaking', 'ice.Will', 'odd', 'couple', 'find', 'true', 'love', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'willing', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'course', 'willingness', 'go', 'along', 'fluffy', 'diverting', 'affair', 'also', 'camp', 'happen', 'be', 'regarding', 'Ms.', 'Tautou', 'saucer-eyed', 'Gallic', 'allure', 'are', 'apparently', 'immune', 'unevenness', 'tone', 'particularly', 'stemming', 'over-reliance', 'gimmick', 'listening', 'character', 'Deep', 'Thoughts', 'aim', 'poetic', 'heights', 'tend', 'crash-land', 'just', 'side', 'Hallmark', 'greeting', 'card', 'not', 'enough', 'sink', 'proceedings', 'film', 'saved', 'Tautou', 'Damiens', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'bring', 'endearing', 'charm', 'roles', 'shambling', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'gentle', 'humanity', 'grok', 'what', 'Nathalie', 'so', 'appealing', 'Think', 'film', 'souffl', 'eacute', 'depending', 'what', 'bring', 'table', 'can', 'be', 'entree', 'dessert', ""'re"", 'type', 'who', 'could', 'bypass', 'entree', 'go', 'straight', 'dessert', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'sweet', 'tooth', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'skip']",N/A

Much of the success of this slightly to the edge story of the vagaries of love and life as they intertwine is due to the presence of the irresistible charm and charisma of lead actress Audrey Tautou. She is able to take this story that at times seems impossibly off track and keep it grounded in her sense of lightness and focus, making us believe that what actually happens to this character is truly quite possible.Nathalie Kerr (Audrey Tautou) is a successful businesswoman who happens to meet the rather unkempt but impish Franois (Pio Marma, an irresistibly charming actor) quite by accident (and an order of apricot juice) in a caf&eacute;. Nathalie is literally swept off her feet and rather quickly this spontaneous meeting of hearts results in blissful marriage. The perfect scenario ends tragically when Franois is accidentally kill. Nathalie's heart seems irreparable and she trudges through life bathed in grief and longing.  Even her handsome boss Charles (Bruno Todeschini) can't woo her: Nathalie is frank in her objection that Charles is a married man. Then the door to her office opens and a subordinate nerdy appearing geek named Markus Lundi (Franois Damiens) walks in and Nathalie impetuously greets him with a passionate kiss - an act she represses thinking that such a deed was impossible. And this apparent one-sided accidental occurrence lightens Markus' life and he is committed to falling in love with the resistant Nathalie. The `courtship' leads to Nathalie's recognition that love and happiness can happen in the most unexpected places and ways.Summarizing the story makes it sound trite and bordering on silly, but it is the delicately French manner in which it is told that makes the film so refreshingly endearing. The entire cast is first class (director St&eacute;phane Foenkinos is best known as one of France's best casting directors!) but it is the glimmering lightness of Tautou and Marma and Damiens that make it sail.

1553026,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008H1Q3QY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[19, 19]","The infectious Audrey Tautou takes center stage in this charming French confection about love in its various configurations.  Ever since ""Amelie,"" I've been enchanted with Tautou.  She is so likable and natural with an intriguing ease on screen.  It's almost impossible not to relate to her in some manner, and I think this appeal can sometimes overshadow her talent.  And she is a true talent, she just makes it look simple.  She goes through a strong character arc in ""Delicacy"" and is absolutely terrific.  From contentment, to loss and withdrawal, to romantic rebirth--Tautou experiences much in this film filled with both melancholy and hope.  Billed as a whimsical romantic comedy, I wouldn't discount this movie as merely frothy entertainment (although it surely is).  There is a truth and poignancy at the heart of ""Delicacy"" that really resonates.  This isn't pure fantasy.  There are real life situations, genuine heart, and a surprising depth beneath the sweet exterior.  And I, for one, appreciated that the movie felt true to life without sacrificing its charm.As the movie opens, Tautou seems to be a woman who has it all.  But this idyllic existence is short lived as a tragic accident scrambles her contented life.  Picking up three years later, Tautou has thrown herself into her career.  Although well liked, she appears to have dismissed all notions of finding romance.  In fact, she isn't looking for it in any way, shape, or form.  Fending off unwanted advances and becoming the fodder for office speculation, one day she breaks routine with a defiant and almost unconscious act.  She impetuously kisses a subordinate (Francois Damiens) and proceeds as if nothing has happened.  But Damiens is besotted and this unremarkable (and relatively meaningless) moment might just have long range repercussions.  The two are an unlikely match, but they begin a casual friendship that is very winning.  Can you find love when you're not looking for it?  Or is there any other way?  The biggest obstacle, in this case, is the resistant Tautou.  But maybe everything happens for a reason.Tautou, as I've said, is really great here but she is matched by Damiens (traditionally known for more broad comedy).  While I was amused throughout, I was also completely invested in both of the characters.  I'm not particularly sentimental, but this simple story felt remarkably believable.  An easy recommendation for fans of French romance, I think this is a film experience with pretty universal appeal.  Its goals are relatively modest, but it certainly achieves what it sets out to do.  About 4 1/2 stars.  The North American release has Bonus features that include a making-of featurette as well as an exclusive interview with the luminous Tautou.

They are well-suited, young and in love, and life is blossoming for them. The unbelievable happens, and Nathalie finds herself a widow. Work keeps her sane and alone, until one day when a co-worker Markus enters her office, and Nathalie does something irrational.What now? Everyone can see that Markus (Francois Damiens) is clearly wrong for her and not like Francois on the surface. Except that he discerns Nathalie's virtue and compassion. But he's a bit gawky, not as handsome as Francois, and he's an underling perhaps lacking ambition.It has been three years since Francois' death, but can Nathalie love another? This movie feels authentic. Tautou is captivating and Damiens makes you grin every time you see him. You care about this couple and want them to find a little happiness in this not always kind world.I love to watch French films to improve my French, plus seeing the French background.

1553030,A129YBX5BVNW2,B008H1Q3QY,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[8, 11]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE UK BLU RAY VERSION (Released Aug 2012) ***""Delicacy"" isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination - but nowadays is that rarest of digital beasts - a 'kind' film - a gently unfolding love story about two polar opposites who need to give each other a chance...But therein lies some of this French movie's problems with critics and audiences alike (never mind the English subtitles). We're essentially being asked to believe what some would say is absurd - after the loss of her ludicrously handsome and beloved husband Francois (Pio Marmai) - the swanlike beauty Nathalie Kerr (Audrey Tautou) then falls in love with the office klutz - the balding cardigan-wearing Swedish clerk Markus Lundl (Francois Damiens). And of course in the real world - no such thing would happen. But I'd argue that David and Stephane Foenkinos' movie is better than that...""La Delicatesse"" (the original French title) isn't a rom-com or even a comedy as the trailer clumsily tries to portray - it's rather more serious than that. It's a journey from heartbreak back to hope - and it's done with class and a deliberately languid pace. It comes with the usual office dynamics - the already-married boss Charles (Bruno Todeschini) consumed with the widowed prize he can't have - the gossiping secretary Chloe (a shockingly gorgeous Melanie Bernier) and outside of work - friends and their nosey partners who don't rate the social status of Nathalie's new male acquisition (and he's not even that pretty either).Speaking of physical beauty and its grip on our world in 2011 - the script has a go at these social hypocrisies and often succeeds. But I was more impressed with other sublime and touching moments... When Nathalie returns after the funeral to her apartment and the blurry emptiness just hits her - when she picks up a friend's child in a playground and smiles for the first time in a long while - when she later gets an inexpensive but thoughtful gift from Markus that changes her perspective of him so completely. And their year-after-year relationship is allowed to grow slowly - talks on the office roof (dialogue above) - when Markus sees Nathalie's elegant neckline as they exit a restaurant - when Nathalie's elderly aunt greets them in the rain at her country cottage and remarks that he is ""a good man""...The BLU RAY picture is good - beautiful in places - but hardly exceptional it has to be said. Defaulted to 1.85:1 aspect ratio it does at least fill the entire screen and the English subtitles are never unreadable. There are 15 deleted scenes (some quite substantial) and the 21 blooper reels where the cast has a giggle are a welcome blast (even having a light-hearted poke at ""The Artist"" on the last one).The camera adores every second of Audrey Tautou - and sometimes her extraordinary beauty works against her - yet she imbibes her Nathalie with a hurt and longing that is wholly believable. When she sobs or delights - you feel both with an equal wallop. Francois Damiens does even better - never overplaying the ordinariness of his Markus - just letting it flow out slowly - but also allowing him those dizzy moments of seize-the-day or love will elude you. Very touching stuff...Perhaps it's just me - but I can't help but feel that we've been so emotionally bludgeoned over the years by bad movies, violence and cruelty-as-cool - that something as genuinely lovely as ""Delicacy"" finds itself being poo-pooed and dismissed in certain quarters. I'd say take a chance on this one - it will reward you......And if Audrey Tautou or Melanie Bernier need a dish on their arms for a premier or a red carpet or two - once the female queue outside the hall door has died down and the football's over - I'm available (for a very reasonable fee).BLU RAY Specifications:Video: 1.85:1 - Full Screen Aspect RatioAudio: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and 2.0 Stereo LPCMSubtitles: A French Film with English Subtitles OnscreenEXTRAS:1.
